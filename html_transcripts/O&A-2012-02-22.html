<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Ant recounting a morning panic stemming from leaving his wallet, ID, and cash at home, requiring Kenny's rescue.  This led to a discussion about the erratic nature of NYC cab drivers, ranging from aggressive driving to surprisingly polite encounters, and the often unsanitary conditions of some cabs.  Ant's upcoming Turks and Caicos vacation transitioned the conversation to a mutual friend's frequent trips to Dubai, fueling speculation about his potentially clandestine CIA-related work. A caller, Keith, complained about an overly enthusiastic resort wake-up call, prompting further discussion about vacation preferences.  Listeners then contributed their experiences in Dubai, focusing on the accessibility of prostitution in certain hotels and cultural expectations surrounding public displays of affection.  Specific hotels were discussed, weighing luxury against proximity to more liberal nightlife. The arrest of a British couple for public indecency in Dubai highlighted the clash between Western and Middle Eastern customs.  The hosts then promoted their upcoming Cleveland live show, including pre-sale ticket information. The segment concluded with a discussion of CM Punk's viral video criticizing Chris Brown, and a humorous disagreement about the significance of the 1980 "Miracle on Ice" hockey game, particularly Sam's lack of enthusiasm and knowledge, prompting a debate on defining memorable sports moments.

This transitioned into a longer segment focusing on the "Miracle on Ice," with Sam's lack of interest serving as the primary comedic driver. The conversation meandered through inappropriate jokes, childhood anecdotes, and graphic details about Sam's late circumcision at age 19 and the resulting urination difficulties.  Numerous sports moments and athletes were mentioned, including the Bill Buckner error, CM Punk's wrestling career, Sidney Crosby, Arthur Ashe, Kurt Angle, Tom Brady, Hulk Hogan, and Jeremy Lin, often met with Sam's skepticism or ridicule. Callers expressed disbelief at Sam’s lack of knowledge.  The discussion eventually shifted to New York City pizza recommendations, demonstrating the show's rambling nature.  Studio guest Roland was repeatedly mentioned due to his fervent, albeit uninformed, fandom of Jeremy Lin.

The next segment centered on a caller, Sam, who detailed his childhood struggle to urinate due to an uncircumcised foreskin.  The hosts and callers engaged in highly graphic and sexually suggestive speculation about parental negligence,  with vulgar jokes and hypotheticals about Sam's mother.  Another caller, Sean, shared his experience with his sons' circumcision.  The conversation then moved to CM Punk's Twitter feud and subsequent video response to Chris Brown, analyzing the public reaction and potential consequences for Chris Brown.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Sam's penis issue and the CM Punk/Chris Brown feud.

A significant portion of the broadcast tackled the controversy surrounding the use of "chink in the armor" regarding Jeremy Lin.  The hosts and callers debated the phrase's inherent racism, intentionality, and appropriate response.  The conversation branched into comparisons with other celebrities' controversies (Tommy Lee, Chris Brown), hypothetical fights (Chris Brown vs. CM Punk), personal anecdotes (Jimmy's altercation with Jesse Ventura with graphic descriptions of injuries), criticism of Howard Stern's work ethic and their agent Bob, analysis of Dana White’s comments on Floyd Mayweather Jr., media censorship surrounding the incident, and personal experiences with cheating. The segment was filled with graphic descriptions and offensive racial slurs.

The final segment began with a discussion on racial slurs, contrasting the use of "nappy-headed hoe" within the Black community with other slurs like "chink."  This transitioned to a misinterpretation of the "Star-Spangled Banner" lyrics, possibly with guest "Dick Wiggler."  The main focus shifted to accusations against SiriusXM employee "Club Soda Kenny" of spreading false rumors about Sam Roberts (a Twitter feud and masturbating on Facebook). Sam vehemently denied these claims, accusing Kenny of self-promotion.  The segment concluded with playful insults and a refusal to shake hands due to alleged semen.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it. Good morning.  Good morning.  Did he give you a good morning today?  No, I ran in behind Kenny. I didn't see him at all.  Oh yeah, you were in a bit of a panic today, right?  Yeah, I pulled up and I went to pay the cabbie.  Yeah.  And I realized I had no cash, no wallet, and no building ID.  So I was, it's embarrassing.  Well, what does the cab driver do in that instance?  I guess I'm, because I always get to stop like around, like on 6th Avenue. 
[00:00:30]  I'm like, could you make this left? No, no, no, no. Go down in front of the building.  Yeah.  I'm like, look, I forgot my money, but I have to call my guy.  He'll come down.  And he didn't say anything. I could tell he was probably annoyed, but I look like an honest boy.  One time I had to get his address.  Did you do, I wondered what I would do if I didn't have Kenny to call.  They get really mad, but every once in a while you'll get one that just understands and he'll give you his address, assuming you're never going to send the money. 
[00:01:00]  But of course you gotta.  Now, what do you do? What do they get mad? What do you do?  I don't know. I don't know.  I guess they would drive you all the way back home to get your wallet, some of these people, depending on the fare.  And of course they would have the meter running the whole time.  But so what? Kenny had to come down and save you?  Yeah. Well, if they drive you home, you have to run back up.  They probably want to hold your license or something.  I would never let anyone hold my license. I wouldn't trust them.  Oh, but you had a license on you?  No, no, no. You're right. I actually didn't.  You had nothing on you.  No, I don't.  So they would probably, if they want to be real dicks, they'll drive you all the way back home with the meter running, knowing that's where you came out of. 
[00:01:30]  Right, and then knowing that you can.  Yeah. But then at that point, you just go back in your building and hide for a while. Fuck them.  Yeah.  Because now you owe them $100.  I don't know.  I couldn't do that, though, because I had to come to work.  I can't picture it. I just think of the calling bladder.  Like, look, I'm hiding from a taxi driver.  I can't come in today.  I hope to get someone quick.  Hey, man.  You know, it sucks that we have to depend on cabs in New York City. 
[00:02:00]  Every time you get in one, you don't know who you're getting.  No.  You get fucking lunatic sometimes.  And you say one thing, like you try to help them out and go, no, I'd rather you go this way.  And they get fucking pissed.  And then sometimes they take you on a death ride.  Have you been on a death ride with a cabbie where he's just so mad he's now going to go as fast as humanly possible?  I've had those, but not because they were mad at me.  I've just had that because of the psychotic that was driving the car.  Yeah, or you know how the lights will change just as the cab is, you know, reaching them? 
[00:02:30]  They'll, like, jam on the brakes, hit the gas, jam on the brakes.  They know.  They know if they just slow down slightly and then readjust to their speed, they'll go through all the lights nice and smooth.  But they're so pissed at you, they're going just a little too fast, so the light's still red.  So they jam on the brakes, then, you know, and then hit the gas, making you completely car sick in the back.  Well, how awful is it when the cabbie is courteous?  Yeah.  And they're never courteous, but when they are, like, they see a yellow light and they slow down. 
[00:03:00]  It's like, what the fuck are you doing, man?  If you were alone, you'd go right through this thing looking for somebody.  Of course.  I make the Jamaican one, what's that?  I always suck that.  And that's a big one.  When it's 5 o'clock at 5.30 in the morning, it can be heard loud and clear from the back seat.  They don't like that.  I'll give them one of those.  Come on.  And then every once in a while, you get a female, which is the most bizarre thing.  And one lady, I've had, I think, two female cabbies in the last who knows how many years, right? 
[00:03:30]  So I had to ask.  I go, why isn't there enough female cabbies?  And she said, because we can't fucking piss in the cabs.  So a lot of women just don't want to drive the cabs because it's a pain in the ass to try to figure out where to pee all the time.  A lot of these fucking guys will just pee in bottles.  They'll pull over and pee in a fucking bottle.  They're not getting out of their cab to try to find a bathroom.  In most cases.  I think when I get in sometimes and they stink and they really reek, I'm like... 
[00:04:00]  It's unbelievable, right?  This is a hack joke.  But it's like they really do stink.  And it's not all of them.  Like today, the guy was fine.  Right.  But you'll get in once in a while and go, how the fuck are you allowing people into this car with you?  You're terrible.  I don't know.  I don't even know what that's about.  That's days without showering.  That's not one day.  That's not...  You know, I work out before I hit my shift and I didn't have time to shower.  That's days of rotting in your own fucking clothes.  And by the way, when I get in every morning, I tell them how I want to go before. 
[00:04:30]  I go, I'm going to this address and I go, can we go down Broadway?  Please, thanks.  I appreciate it.  Right.  That's my routine every day.  I've been in the cabs with me.  In this way, you've already said it before.  They can go, all right, this is quicker.  Right.  You've already thanked them.  You've wrapped up the discussion in a bow.  It's all over at that point.  Because if they go down, like the way New York works, the way like the east side, the  west side work is like, Broadway kind of is like a vein.  It doesn't go straight down.  And it gets farther. 
[00:05:00]  It goes towards Midtown more away from the west side as you go farther down.  Sure.  So up by where we are, if you go from all the way from the west side, like from 11th  Avenue onto Broadway, it's like one or two blocks.  But if you go down 11th Avenue to 40 fucking 8th and cut over, it's like fucking five blocks.  And those are big New York blocks with lights.  Yeah, it angles.  It takes a few more minutes.  And at this hour, a few more minutes is forever. 
[00:05:30]  Dude, I ran out and fucking eight minutes up today.  I was so proud of myself.  I was like, I don't know, it's just us.  I'm like, I want to be there before six.  And then I have to sit down there like a fucking five-year-old getting yelled at.  It's humiliating.  Me and Kenny are out of our minds.  This is how stupid things become.  The lights had such a nice pattern to them where he picks me up.  We stopped.  We stopped at one light and that's it.  And everything else runs smooth.  It's all green lights all the way.  And I'm talking, how many lights do we do? 
[00:06:00]  Almost 20 probably?  Yeah.  And we only stop at one light and then it's go time, right?  They changed the fucking traffic pattern.  It's driving us nuts.  It's twice as long now in the morning.  Where are they changing?  On Broadway?  Yeah.  They also put speed bumps.  Do you go up our street?  They put speed bumps that fucking you can't hit that one light.  I know.  It used to be a timing pattern where if you hit it, you get the light.  That's the one light we stop at at the top of the hill.  And then the rest of them are usually green, but they changed the fucking pattern. 
[00:06:30]  So now it's twice as long and people are going to be like, whatever.  It went from five minutes to ten minutes.  And ten minutes at 5.15 in the morning is brutal.  It is amazing how, like, I forget how bad people's commute is.  Like, when Ant gets stuck coming in, like, if he leaves ten minutes too late.  I shouldn't even be bitching.  You're right.  I forget how bad commutes are because, like, I'll tell people, like, oh, yeah, I'm here.  I live 25 blocks or 30 blocks away.  What?  Like, that's your – and there's no traffic in the morning. 
[00:07:00]  And coming home is –  Yeah, you're right.  God, you get so used to it.  But, you know, it is what it is, what you're used to.  And when that changes, it bothers you.  Yeah, and the pattern changed where the light turns red but there's a green arrow.  But there's no reason for us to stop because it's a one-way.  You know what I mean?  It's a one-way going straight.  They stop all traffic but they allow a green arrow for the people that want to turn left.  Oh, I don't even know.  But I don't understand why we have to stop.  There's no reason for it because there's no cars coming from the right, you know, across us. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, is it on Going Up 6, you mean?  Going Up Broadway.  Is this too local for people?  Well, you know, whatever their streets are, they've dealt with traffic pattern changes.  You think that's what they're doing right now?  Yeah, they're probably going, ah, you know, Elm.  Yeah, they're basically talking about Elm.  No, what they're doing right now is –  I have the same problem with Elm in the morning so I can relate to these idiots.  They're screaming at their radios right now.  Like, shut the fuck up.  You guys have a 10-minute commute in traffic.  We're bitching.  It is – because people are going to drive in through the tunnel. 
[00:08:00]  Like, when I come back from the airport, usually I don't hit traffic in the morning because I land too early.  Right.  But once in a while, the plane is delayed and you hit what normal people deal with.  I don't know how the fuck you guys – I literally don't know how there's not murders every day on the road.  I was one of those guys and that's why I said fuck this and chose to live in the city.  I've been in the city, what, 10 years now?  Yeah.  At least?  About 10 years.  Wow.  Yeah, because I couldn't deal with the commute to Long Island anymore.  I couldn't deal with that commute to Huntington. 
[00:08:30]  And I wasn't even doing rush hour for the most part.  I was off hours and I couldn't deal with it.  It's just enraging.  It is enraging.  You know, but the politicians will never fucking take care of the problem.  I mean, obviously there's a major issue with commuting in and out of this city and there must be some way to fix it.  But no one wants to take on that challenge.  Well, they want you –  That's a biggie.  They want you to just mass transit.  Bloomberg and those guys, they want you to take the trains and the buses.  They don't want – they don't want to make it easier to drive.  They don't want as many cars, right? 
[00:09:00]  No, they'll never make it easier for people.  But I see that as maybe because New York's crowded, but that's kind of like shitting on the middle class a little bit.  Because, you know, really poor people and middle class people, a lot of them – it's too expensive to take the fucking train.  But then again, they have to park their car, so maybe that's – I should shut up.  I don't know.  I don't know what the thing is.  What do I know?  I'm just a sweet boy.  But let's get into this.  It's grim in the morning again.  It's me and Jimmy.  And it's on vacation.  He'll be back Monday.  Yes.  He's in the Caribbean. 
[00:09:30]  It's weird for him to only go away for a week.  Why?  I don't know.  Didn't he should go for two weeks?  Last year he did two, yeah.  I'm doing a week in March.  Where are you going?  I'm going down to the Caribbean.  Are you?  I'm going to Turks and Caicos.  That's my spot.  I love it down there.  I'm going to go away for a week.  I'm going to go away for years.  I want to go to Dubai, but after I shoot –  You're going away for a week.  I want to after I shoot.  You never go away.  I was going to do it beforehand, but I couldn't do it because of the day of the April 28th  shoot in Cleveland.  I said nothing before that.  I can't do anything but work before that.  Yeah.  And then I'm going to take – or five days or something. 
[00:10:00]  I've never, ever, ever do that.  If you go to Dubai, I got people over there.  I got some peeps.  Yeah, you guys have a friend, right?  Yeah.  He might be CIA.  I don't know.  He won't tell us.  We're suspicious, though.  Why else are you in Dubai?  And why else do you get to just make your own hours and all of a sudden you show up in  New York for two weeks?  Is he a contractor?  Who gets to do that?  I don't know.  We don't know what he does.  He's very vague about his job.  He listens to us, by the way.  He'll hear this two weeks from now.  Oh, really?  He's like two weeks behind.  Sorry. 
[00:10:30]  He'll come to New York and he'll start talking about the show.  And I'm like, we did that like a month ago.  Well, I'm catching up.  Now, he's a good guy, though.  He'll show you around.  He showed Amy Schumer around.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, when she was over there doing some stuff for the troops.  I really want to go and I want to stay in the Burge Tower, that giant tower.  Because our friend Saad, who I've told you about, the guy who runs a TV station in Afghanistan,  lives in Dubai.  Right.  And his company has a rate or something at that tower for the hotel. 
[00:11:00]  And I want to just go and just see that city.  I don't know why I want to see Dubai.  I really do, though.  But what are you going to do there?  Do you know?  You can shop and there's a lot to see there.  That's like a Western place in the Middle East.  Right.  And I'm looking forward to the airline.  I want to fly Emirates.  I want to fly Emirates to Dubai and stay for four or five days and come back.  Damn, you should do that.  My buddy there will hook you up, too.  He's good at getting info if you ever need info.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't say that. 
[00:11:30]  Oops.  But no, I don't know what you do there.  Oops.  But we don't know.  We don't know anything.  Well, he probably works for the military if he's in there.  Oh, no, he is military.  He's absolutely military.  That's where it gets suspicious.  He seems to, like, not be in Dubai when major events are going down, too.  How old is he?  He's 30, probably, 31, somewhere around there.  We don't know.  I really don't know for sure.  Do you ever ask him?  Yeah, he just laughs.  I told you the story.  We were coming back from Philly. 
[00:12:00]  I happened to be down there doing some family stuff.  And he's from there originally.  And we're getting on Amtrak to come back up to New York.  He just so happens to be coming to New York when I was leaving.  So I'm like, yeah, let's do this together, right?  So I didn't have a ticket.  He had a ticket.  And we go up to the ticket booth.  And I'm purchasing my ticket.  And the woman, without even seeing an ID or nothing, we walked up, said,  Hi, Mr. Blank. 
[00:12:30]  Well, why?  I don't know.  You explained that one to me.  Had he been there a few minutes earlier?  No.  We drove to the train station together.  Does he make that commute all the time?  No.  Did she get his name right?  Yes.  But how?  I don't know.  Was he the last one to check in, maybe?  He did have a ticket.  So maybe he was the last one to check in?  I just found that very strange.  Yeah, that's weird.  Thank you, Kenny.  So suspicious things have happened over the years. 
[00:13:00]  So I don't know.  I don't know.  But he will show you a good time.  I don't know why I want to go to that city so much and stay in that hotel.  I just, because I've never been to the Middle East other than Iraq.  Right.  And I don't want to go to, obviously you can't go to Iran now.  And I wouldn't go to Afghanistan to vacation.  So this is kind of as close as you can go.  No, Dubai would be a good start for you as far as the Middle East goes, right?  Yeah.  It just looks like a fun, it's supposedly expensive.  Really expensive.  But you can use your credit card there.  And it's like, you know, it's westernized. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  Of course.  Let me say hi to Keith in Connecticut.  Keith.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, we went to Torch St. Geico's like two years in a row.  And the resort we stayed at, it's like 7, 7.30 in the morning.  And this fucking guy starts screaming over the microphone, wakey, wakey.  And they're down there in their little Zumba outfit.  I'm on vacation.  This fucking guy's screaming every morning.  Do they do that?  Where do you go?  I mean, do I have to spend a little bit more money?  That's funny. 
[00:14:00]  I don't have a wake-up guy.  I don't have an exercise guy waking me up.  Hell no, man.  They had a stage where they were doing shows at nighttime.  And in the morning, the guy's just going crazy.  Oh, fuck that.  I opened my slider and told him.  And I'd be, shut the fuck up.  No, when I'm on vacation, I sleep in.  I sleep to about 6.30, 6.45 when I'm on vacation.  I'm sleeping in.  Yes.  All right.  Have a good day.  Wait, wait.  I want to know where is that place?  Listen, there's a casino.  No, I forgot the exact name of it. 
[00:14:30]  But as soon as you walk in your door, there's a casino to the right.  And it was fantastic.  It was great.  Right.  Yeah, it's fucking brutal, man.  Were you on, I'll go local, Cable Beach?  I don't remember the exact name, man.  You would remember Cable Beach.  It's beautiful.  Yeah, no, I don't have Greg Hughes money.  Nah, come on.  I actually went to Turks and Caicos when I had no money.  I used to do the Club Med, which is right on Cable Beach. 
[00:15:00]  That's a good time.  That might have been when we did.  I don't remember the exact thing when we did, but I know the guy was screaming for a consecutive  seven days.  How annoying would that be?  Terrible.  If you're one of these guys that sleeps in and you got to deal with that every morning?  Dude, I'm annoyed if I have to have a woman next to me, much less some guy yelling  through a fucking microphone.  I want to be left alone and sleep on a vacation.  Yeah.  So.  All right.  Have a good day, boys.  Bye, buddy.  All right, Keith.  I wonder if anyone's ever been to Dubai, too.  What do people do when they go there?  Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out for you.  Because after a while, just being in the tower, you're going to be bored. 
[00:15:30]  After you see the view, you're like, okay, what else can I do here?  Go to the restaurant.  There's probably a lot of good restaurants.  I don't know why.  Are you going to go alone?  No, with Jonathan.  Jonathan's going to.  Oh, fuck.  You're hooked up.  Hopefully, Saad will be there.  You'll probably be taking private planes elsewhere.  No.  Why would you go on vacation with Jonathan?  Because he lives.  For the people out there, Jonathan is the guy that all of a sudden will just be in the  middle of West Africa because he's bored.  Yeah.  He's my manager, and people know he goes away a lot.  But if you're going to travel with somebody, you want to travel with somebody who enjoys. 
[00:16:00]  He was telling me one time he was in Indonesia.  He might have told a story on the air, and he just got separated from people, and he had  to take a ride home from a stranger in Indonesia, which is like 90% Muslim, and he couldn't  be more Jewish.  Right.  He's just one of those guys who enjoys other places, and I'm so.  But why is he so comfortable, you think?  I don't know.  We've all discussed it behind his back.  I mean, it's crazy.  It's crazy half the stuff he does, but he's so comfortable.  That confuses me.  Does he have a little CIA action going on or something? 
[00:16:30]  No.  My guess is that he's comfortable, and that's what makes people comfortable with him.  It's that he's not.  He doesn't look at them like, hey, let me see what this weird shit country is.  Or he really is interested in them.  And there's something.  It's almost like, you know, a dog can smell fear on you.  Right.  And when you're not afraid, a dog won't bite you most times.  These people probably sense, I mean, in weird places.  He's not scared.  He's not uncomfortable.  He belongs there.  And when you feel like you belong somewhere, people just kind of respond to you as such.  And it also shows we just don't know shit about the rest of the world. 
[00:17:00]  We just assume that a lot of these places are beyond scary.  You land, and next thing you know, you're kidnapped and your head's coming off.  Yeah.  And probably, you know, the opposite is true.  In general, it's very safe out there.  Well, why else would he just travel around freely like he does?  Do you know how many times I've said to him, like, I've bashed another country.  I say, no, no, no, no, Jim, Jim, Jim.  They don't hate you.  He just tries to calm me because he's so codependent.  He tries to calm me down before I get angry.  Right.  He's like, no, no, Jim, Jim, Jim.  They like America.  Jim, Jim, Jim.  I'm like, John, I'm not yelling at you when you're six. 
[00:17:30]  You don't have to calm me down.  It's okay.  But, you know, he's been to all these places that I attack, and he's like, no, they like  Americans.  Right, right.  I think every place hates Americans.  Yeah, probably not.  Yeah, I'm probably fucking an ignorant, self-centered American.  You want to know about Dubai?  I really do, because I want to go there.  It's the one place I want to go see.  And Jimmy rarely goes on vacation, so we've got to set him up nice.  Joe in Maryland.  What's up, Joe?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, ma'am.  Hey, when I was in the service, I used to be in Dubai probably once every six months. 
[00:18:00]  And the women out there love us.  Well, the women, are they hookers or are they regular girls?  You got half on one hand, six on another.  You can get whatever you want out there.  I'd be scared, to be honest with you.  I don't think I would do that in Dubai.  I just don't.  I don't think I would take that chance.  You're going to have a long week.  I would just rather whack my bag, because I don't know that culture out there.  Like, that one British couple was arrested for kissing in public or whatever. 
[00:18:30]  They are Muslim, and it's like, that's a strict culture, and I don't want to do something that gets me in jail in Dubai.  Yeah.  I used to stay at a hotel.  It was called the Dreamland Hotel.  Is that the one shaped like a sail or no?  No, that's the new one that they got going on out there now.  Okay.  Where's the Dreamland?  I can't remember off the top of my head where it was, but within 15 minutes of checking in, you get a knock on the door. 
[00:19:00]  It would be this Arabic guy, and he'd be like, how many do you want, and how long do you want them for?  No.  Yes.  That's the temptation?  Yes.  Wait, that looks like Atlantis.  Yeah, I think that's it.  That can't be it, right?  We're looking at a hotel in Dubai that looks just like Atlantis, if you know that, from the Bahamas.  There's also a sailboat-shaped hotel.  Right.  The construction there is pretty cool, but their economy, did their economy just shit the bed horribly? 
[00:19:30]  I think they're running out of funds or something, I've heard.  Yeah, they couldn't finish the islands they were building.  Wait, I want to talk to Joe, though.  So, you check into your hotel.  The guy leaves after putting your luggage in or whatever.  And next thing you know, a few minutes later, someone's knocking at your door?  Yep, some guy would knock on your door, and he would ask you, how many do you want?  One, two, three, how long do you want them for?  You negotiate with him, and he leaves the girls. 
[00:20:00]  Kimmy, you're not going to be able to say no to that.  They'd probably do that in the Dreamland Hotel, which looks like a Super 8.  Oh, yeah, the Dreamland Hotel doesn't look like it's on the up and up.  It's shitty, sir.  It wasn't a bad place when I was out there.  It was a real nice place.  Now, I don't know, it's been probably about five years since I've been out there.  But maybe everyone knows you go to the Dreamland Hotel if you're looking for some action.  There's pictures of smiling Arabic guys, like one standing next to the pool.  I mean, a pool table, and one sitting in a chair. 
[00:20:30]  It looks like Ron Jeremy.  Yeah.  I would not go there.  Yeah, their brochure is really shitty.  Check the hotel inside the Burge.  So, did you go for it?  Of course.  I was in the military.  I was out there for, you know, three years, of course.  And what did you do?  One, two, or three?  We used to party it up.  We used to get three and four.  Hold on.  Oh, here's some information.  We are a one-star hotel category.  So, it's situated in Al Riga, or Riga Street, the heart of Adiria, Dubai, which is conveniently 
[00:21:00]  located within walking distance to the business district of Al Gurai Shopping Center and the  New Al Riga Shopping Mall Center, about five kilometers drive from Dubai International  Airport, in both 68 tastefully decorated rooms.  It's a one-star hotel.  One-star hotel in Dubai.  Oh, boy.  What's another one?  Oh, boy.  Anything else, Joe?  One-star hotel.  That's it, man.  I just figured that was up to be up Jimmy's Alley. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, Jimmy's all about a one-star hotel.  Not a...  Sir, I want a gentleman's accommodations.  Yeah.  Well, I didn't.  Maybe not talk and refer to the accommodations, but the...  Oh, the sex, yes.  Yeah, the treats.  Dude, that would scare me.  The services.  I'd be too scared.  Someone knocks on your door.  That would be fucking scary.  It'd be hard not to do it, but I'd be too scared to do it, because I just, like, you  know, I can't fucking do it.  I can't get arrested there.  What are you looking at, sir?  Oh, I'm rich.  We used to go out to the bars out there. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Nah.  All right.  The women would just love American guys.  I think it's a size difference, to be honest with you.  What?  They have small ones in Dubai.  They have big ones.  They're relieved that our little dicks.  They have big Middle Eastern dicks.  What is that?  That's Atlantis, Dubai.  Atlantis, Dubai.  What's Atlantis, Dubai?  It's just like Atlantis in the Bahamas.  I didn't know they had an Atlantis.  It looks very similar.  It's called the Palm over there.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  If you're going to go to Atlantis, you better go to the one in fucking Atlantis, because  Dubai is, again, I don't want that strict government. 
[00:22:30]  If you're going to go to Dubai, you might as well go to the, what is it called?  The Birch?  The Birch.  B-U-R.  Birch.  Birch.  Birch.  Birch.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  I'm going to Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  Hey.  What's going on?  What's up, Billy?  I spelled it wrong, Sam.  Jimmy, you've got to be careful, though.  Some of the hotels allow the girls to come in, and some don't.  So, like, if you stay on the Crown Plaza of Sheikh El Zid, when you bring the girl in,  this guy will step out of the corner, and he'll say, you know, who's the girl?  And you say, well, it's my sister.  And then he'll take her passport, and he'll hold it at the front desk. 
[00:23:00]  Yes.  So, like, say the girl comes up, cleans your room and whatever.  However, when she leaves, the front desk will call your room to make sure it's her.  Your phone is, sir, your phone is kind of dropping out, but I know what you're saying.  They do that in Rio, too.  You're allowed to have one guest at a time up there, and that's probably so you don't  get ripped off, and that they don't have girls running through the hotel ripping off  other customers.  They'll take her passport or her ID at the front desk.  She'll go up with you, fuck you for the night.  And when she comes back in the morning to claim her ID, they call your room. 
[00:23:30]  And they go, is everything all right?  And you go, yeah, everything's great.  Thank you very much.  My guest is leaving.  Okay, thank you.  Wow.  It's a very courteous interaction, but what they're saying is, are you tied up?  Have you been robbed?  Right.  And they don't want anybody, they don't want any hassles like that, but there's two places  to go.  There's the Marina Bay Club for the Asians and the Cyclone Club for the Russians.  And you can only do your deals in there.  You'll not see it out in public. 
[00:24:00]  And you have to make sure that you stay in the hotels that allow you to have a friend  to come up.  Now, most hotels allow you to have somebody come up, but they have to leave their ID at  the front.  Yeah.  The four or five star hotels, like the Burge, is a great hotel.  I don't think they allow them to come up.  They come up, or maybe only one at a time.  But the one star, they don't even care.  But you have to just be careful, because you're still in their country.  You know what I mean?  So you don't want to embarrass anybody.  Yeah, that's the same as Rio. 
[00:24:30]  And I imagine you can bring somebody up.  Oh, yeah, the Armani Hotel.  But if you bring somebody up, they have to leave their ID.  But you're right.  You're in their country.  And that would make me nervous.  I just wouldn't do it.  If you go to the clubs, like the Marina Bay Club, the girls are beautiful.  It's very, very low-key and everything like that.  And they have a great rock band that plays five Asian girls playing, like, Guns N' Roses.  It's great.  I don't think it's like Saudi Arabia, right?  It's not like that. 
[00:25:00]  No, no, no.  It's very, very Western.  I mean, I tell you what, it's the greatest parties.  I've been all over the world, and it's one of the greatest parties ever.  Why do you travel so much?  I do international business.  Oh, okay.  CIA.  I just think everyone's CIA now.  Have you stayed in the Burge?  Yeah, I've stayed in the Burge.  It's too far away from everything.  And so it's just a pain to go anywhere.  If you want to stay, like, in a Western area, it's the Jamyra Beach Resort.  Check out the Hilton.  There's a couple of hotels down there right on the beach. 
[00:25:30]  It's gorgeous.  You could leave hundreds of thousands of dollars on the beach, and nobody would even think of  stealing it.  Boy, the Burge is right in the middle of downtown, isn't it?  No, it's – the downtown is more of a business area.  If you want more of the Western, you want to stay out by the – you want to stay out by  the Emirates Mall or the Western area is more of the Jamyra Beach Resort.  They built this whole beach area that's very Western and very – you wouldn't even notice.  What is the big – what's the big hotel like, the Sailboat?  Oh, that's the Sail.  That's way out by the, like, Atlantis and stuff like that. 
[00:26:00]  It's just in a whole different area.  I mean, everything's so cheap to get around by taxi.  It really doesn't matter.  But you're bringing up a good point with the Burge.  I mean, Jim, you could just go there and check it out.  Dude, it's a seven-star hotel.  It's one of the best hotels in the world.  But if you're going to be away from all the action – what's that, sir?  It's a seven-star hotel if you spend the money.  They also have, like, four-star rooms, too.  Oh, okay.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, if you want the – yeah.  I mean, it's gorgeous.  It's great.  It's beautiful.  But there's also some great hotels, too, that's right in the action and more, you know, 
[00:26:30]  the party area.  What's the number one place to stay?  It's definitely the Sail of the Burge.  I mean, it's definitely the number one.  Maybe go with the Sail, Jim.  Look at – that's where Jonathan wants to sail.  It looks like a giant sail.  It's on the water.  And you could, like, just sit on the beach from your hotel, right?  Yeah.  But, I mean, there's a lot of places like that.  Even, you know, down by JBR, you can do the same thing.  And it's gorgeous.  The water's 95 degrees.  You have to get out because you get, you know, overheated.  See, my thing is if I was going to go to a beach resort, I wouldn't go with John. 
[00:27:00]  Like, I would go with John to hang with him inside in the Middle East and go around and eat dinner  and hang with my buddies.  But I wouldn't go – I wouldn't want to go with a girl to a place like that.  You and Jonathan should walk around the nude beaches together.  No, I just can see his package once.  That's what I'm saying.  But I don't want to go to, you know, I don't want to go to a beach resort with my giant cocked manager  and fucking have to look at his hog on the fucking –  How crazy that'd be.  I say you go to the Sail, man.  Fuck the Burge.  You go there and check out the view.  I don't know.  I like that. 
[00:27:30]  I want to stay in a room and look out that window.  Yeah.  Then again, I should have to –  You don't think that's a target for terrorists, the Burge?  No.  No, not at all.  How about you split your time?  You do a couple days at the Burge and then you go to the Sail for a few days.  Really mix it up, right?  Yeah.  Go down – go down to – go down – check out the Hilton at the Jumaire Beach Resort,  which is a very nice area.  Or the Crown Plaza on Sheikh Al-Zidh.  Or, I mean, there's just – whatever you're looking for, there's everything you can imagine.  Why'd that couple get arrested for kissing there, that British couple? 
[00:28:00]  Because, no, it wasn't just kissing.  They just wouldn't stop.  Oh.  They were asked nicely to please stop, and they weren't just kissing.  They were doing way more than that.  Was there finger-popping going on?  Yeah, was there?  Yeah, they were having sex.  They were asked very, very nicely to stop, and they didn't stop, and they just flaunted it.  And you have to remember, you can't bring – everyone's very tolerant, but you can't just keep flaunting it in their face.  All right, hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute, Paul.  So who saw them having sex?  How many people?  Just a couple of the police – I guess it was a couple of the police that walked through there. 
[00:28:30]  But who doesn't want to see a couple having sex?  It's the Middle East, not –  Columbus, Ohio.  Yeah.  So how long were they in jail?  It wasn't that long.  It wasn't that long.  And it was just because – just because they wouldn't stop and respect the laws.  I mean, it's a great – it's as Western as New York City.  You get off the plane, and you're amazed.  Hold on.  It says here –  How great it is.  It's a jailed couple.  The jail sentence was upheld.  It's a one-month prison sentence. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, one month in Dubai.  They were convicted of kissing in a restaurant.  Well –  That's different.  There was a couple that was – there was a couple that was jailed for having sex on the beach a couple – was it two years ago, three years ago?  Here's a – hold on.  Here's – this says –  Wow.  The pair landed in court after an Emirati woman complained about the public kiss, which the couple insisted was just a peck on the cheek.  They were arrested in November and convicted of inappropriate behavior and illegal drinking. 
[00:29:30]  Cosmopolitan Dubai has the most relaxed social codes in the conservative Gulf,  but authorities enforce strict decency laws and regularly crack down on people accused of pushing the limits,  which include everything from wearing a miniskirt to losing one's temper in traffic.  As recently as Sunday, which is whatever this was,  a young Italian-Iranian couple could be seen kissing among the visitors on the floor of the Burj Khalif. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, okay.  An Indian couple was sentenced to three months in jail for exchanging steamy text messages in 2008.  Two Britons accused of having sex on the beach – there you go – got just three months – got three months in jail,  though their sentences were later suspended.  Wow.  It's just – it's just to make a – make a showing.  But you have to be respectful.  I mean, you don't want to be – you know, you don't want to be drunk in public.  You don't want to be – you know, you don't want to be making out with somebody.  I mean, just be respectful of their areas.  But then you can go to, like, the Marina Bay Club, and it's all hell breaks loose. 
[00:30:30]  No, no, no.  But I'm saying, like, that would freak me out in a restaurant if I'm with a girl to not be able to kiss her.  Like, I don't make out in the restaurant, but a gentle peck because some stupid Emirati woman was raised with a fucking bat to her clit.  That really drives me nuts.  Well, you're going there.  I know.  With Jonathan.  Don't kiss Jonathan.  But it's like the Starbucks.  You know what I mean?  It's completely different.  They must have been doing a lot more or they'd ask them to stop because they're very, very tolerant. 
[00:31:00]  They're trying to, like, smash these two cultures together over there, so they're a little confused, huh?  Yeah.  They want to westernize it, but they also want some tradition as well to be upheld.  Yeah.  The actually Amradi people, it's a very small population of people over there.  It's almost the expats.  If you're going to run into more British and Australian and Americans over there, then you know what to do with.  And I think one of the reasons maybe, first of all, when you look at these sentences, they're not that long. 
[00:31:30]  Three months sucks, but that's not, like, a lifelong jail sentence.  And they're probably doing that so the rest of the Middle East doesn't look at them as this western fuck city and start attacking them.  Well, that's a long time if you're from somewhere else.  Yeah.  Also, you've got to explain to your boss why you're in jail in Dubai.  Imagine that.  I've got more info on that story.  Randy in Ohio says it was in a mosque, and it was a radio stunt.  He had me to use a radio stunt.  I'm like, oh, wait a minute.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, Paul. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, you'll love it.  You'll love it, Jimmy.  All right.  I'll try it.  It's one that – take Emirates because it's just – it's great.  Make sure you get yourself a sleeper in first class.  I don't like that.  That's too expensive.  If I could do it with miles, I would fly first class if I could use miles to upgrade because I have so many miles saved up.  You want my miles?  They won't do it.  No, you use them for your family.  I guess.  They won't upgrade you on miles.  You'll have to – you'll have to just take a business class tick, do, like, an American Express two-for-one deal.  Yeah.  And Jonathan can go –  Oh, you could do that.  You could buy two-for-one on internationals. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a great deal.  It's like 7,000 round trip.  That's not a great deal.  Is that business class?  Yeah, business class two-for-one.  It's – you know, so when you break it down, $3,500 for a 14-hour flight, not a bad deal.  No.  How much is first class?  It's probably ranging from $11,000 to $15,000.  Oh, that hurts.  No, no.  No, no.  That'll leave a bruise.  If there's a way to do it with miles, and you can do it with miles like any other airline, just buy it with miles.  It'll probably cost you a lot.  I would do that, but I can't spend that kind of money.  I can't afford that. 
[00:33:00]  All right, Paul.  Thank you, Paul.  All right.  Thanks, Jimmy.  All right.  Bye, Paul.  Bye.  I got points on my American Express.  Me too, but they're not good for miles anymore.  All the airlines have become –  Yeah, dude.  You're going to lose them if you haven't lost them already.  You're Amex.  I have had an American Express card for 12 years, and I've never looked at my points.  Why?  I don't know.  What do you do with them?  Well, you could have, if you had looked at the date –  Can I get golf clubs?  You probably have a lot saved up, but what you could do with your points is you could 
[00:33:30]  have had them – because what happens, you used to be able to use them on American or  Continental.  Right.  But I think that the airlines got smart and they're like, well, let's run the credit card.  Let's use our own credit cards.  Why give American this privilege?  And, I mean, Amex.  So they took back – the miles expired.  You had X amount of time to transfer them back over into your respective airlines.  I think that it passed already.  Oh, when did I get that letter?  I don't know.  Kenny told me.  Oh, really?  In October.  I think it passed in October of 2011. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, that's good.  But I have a lot.  I have, like, probably 600,000 or 700,000 miles, but so many of it's from purchases and  flying and, you know, over years and years and years.  Oh, wow.  What are you going to do?  I don't know.  Jimmy goes to Dubai.  I can't wait for the stories.  I just fucking –  With Jonathan, too.  Yeah, him I'll have fun with.  Because he's going to have to be adventurous.  I don't think that guy can't –  I don't think he can just hang out in a hotel.  He's going to want to go do some crazy shit.  Oh, he likes to go and the locals eat. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  That's fun.  When are you going?  I don't know.  I don't know.  After – I shoot April 28th, so after that – oh, by the way, pre-sale starts tomorrow  morning.  I will give details today once I get them.  I don't have them.  You don't have them yet?  No, I do.  Wait, can I give them real quick before I forget?  And people were tweeting last night, yes, we're going to Cleveland for a live broadcast.  It's almost definite.  We're going to do the live broadcast the Friday before Jimmy's taping.  Yes, and the pre-sale is from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. tomorrow. 
[00:35:00]  I think the link is playhousesquare.org.  I will Twitter it, and the password is WMMS.  That local station out there is sponsoring this for me.  WMMS is the password, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. tomorrow.  I will put up a link.  Man, we're going to see a lot of people in Cleveland.  I hope so, man.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I hope so.  Yeah, I mean, my Twitter was a buzz yesterday.  They're like, really?  You guys coming to Cleveland?  Yeah, let's do this.  A friend of mine lives out there now, and she works for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Oh, fuck.  You know what?  I should go out there when Guns N' Roses gets inducted. 
[00:35:30]  Fuck.  I would love to be out there for that.  What?  In Cleveland?  Yeah.  Yeah, you just go back.  Would love to.  I don't know when that is, though.  But don't they do that in New York?  No, they used to do it, but they want to promote business in Cleveland.  Oh, they finally moved it to Cleveland?  Yeah, Metallica was in Cleveland.  I guess they were doing it at the Waldorf here in New York, but then there was nothing happening  in Cleveland.  Right.  April 14th.  April 14th.  Oh, forget it.  What day of the week is Eddie Ruck?  Quick before I kiss you.  I don't know.  Hang on.  Saturday.  Oh, forget it.  I can't work him.  You can do C at her, D. 
[00:36:00]  No, that's two weeks before I tape.  I gotta...  All right.  Hey, we're gonna break, and we gotta get into the CM Punk stuff.  Yes.  Can we get him on the show today?  He's done our show.  You're working on it, Sam?  Yeah.  Is there a possibility?  I mean, there's a possibility, but I've been trying to contact people since last night.  Oh, really?  And no one called you back?  Well, apparently he's in New York.  So he could stop by.  He said on his...  We could be part of this story.  He tweeted...  All I know is what he tweeted.  He tweeted late last night, early this morning, that he took a plane to New York City. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, really?  After the SmackDown taping, so...  Where was the SmackDown taping?  I don't know, but the pay-per-view, I think, was in, like, Milwaukee or something, so...  Yeah, we got a situation here.  CM Punk put a video out yesterday, right?  Yeah.  That thing fucking took off.  Holy shit.  It was amazing.  How many people saw it?  I don't know.  When I looked, it was 100,000 within, like, two hours.  Not even two hours.  But it also got reposted and reposted.  No, it's everywhere. 
[00:37:00]  This version is up to 326,000.  It's not even 24 hours old.  But then TMZ took it, and then YouTube took it, and so it's all over.  It's well over a million views.  It's not even 12 hours old.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was late yesterday.  Yeah, he posted it at, like, 7.30 or something.  Yeah, because Chris Brown's response...  Because he has 8 million Twitter followers.  Right.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Well, we'll get into it next.  But he pretty much bitch-slapped Chris Brown on this one, huh? 
[00:37:30]  Um, yeah.  And his argument is kind of hard to combat.  We'll explain next, because it started with them going back and forth on Twitter, and then  CM Punk made this video, right?  Right.  That's where we're at?  All right.  So we'll do it all next.  Stay there.  It's...  This is the old kid.  Oh, wow!  I just want to say it's me and Jimmy today.  Oh.  Sorry, you usually never do that.  Well, I wanted to just say me and Jimmy.  Okay, go ahead.  Jimmy and I.  Jimmy and me.  Me and...  Grim.  Grim.  Greg and, uh...  And Sam and Jim. 
[00:38:00]  Grim.  Why is Sam part of the Grim?  He doesn't have to be part of the Grim.  Oh, you know what?  I thought that the M was for Sam.  Fuck Sam.  Fuck him in the mouth.  No.  Jim is Grim.  Okay, I...  Yeah, we got Grim covered.  Just me and you.  We don't need Sam in there.  I thought...  That's right.  I thought he was part of that.  It's extra letters.  Yeah.  Exactly.  How about Grimace?  No.  It doesn't work.  Good morning.  You stepped on the hook again.  I know.  That's my thing now.  Okay.  It's like a little bit I started yesterday.  Is this for the hockey team? 
[00:38:30]  Yes, it is.  Oh, the Russian.  Losing.  Miracle on Ice.  32 years ago.  Going.  I was joking.  I was joking.  I didn't know.  I didn't know there was miracle in this song.  I don't even know this song.  It's called I Believe in Miracles.  Yeah.  Isn't it a great song?  And there's...  This is what made me like the Ramones with this song.  This song.  And there's a cool...  And I never liked Pearl Jam, but they cover this, or Eddie Vedder does, and does a great  cover of this.  Do you know that, Travis? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  So why don't we listen to that version?  It's in the system.  It's a great cover.  And do we have the Al Michaels call?  This is better, though.  Can we get the Al Michaels call?  Do you believe in miracles?  You'd think he would have it ready, right?  Yeah, I think we should play that today, right?  You got that, Iraq.  We're not just going to say it happened 32 years ago.  We're going to fucking play it, right?  Yeah, that was Al Michaels.  Al Michaels has been around for a long time.  Sam, you don't have to pull it up.  Eric's got it ready.  Why does tiny URL suck on the iPhone? 
[00:39:30]  Cocksucker, cunt!  You got the call, Iraq.  I'm not saying it.  How do you not have the call?  Why wouldn't you just have it?  You got to think we want to play it today.  Well, that's what YouTube's for lately.  Oh, Christ.  Iraq doesn't give a fuck anymore.  I know.  We lost him.  Oh, yeah.  I love Sam, I guess.  Nothing I can see.  This is the start of the game, Sam.  We want the end.  That's good.  The first quarter, score 0-0. 
[00:40:00]  First period.  Oh.  Other radio shows do it.  They just do the call.  I know.  We have fucking, uh, we have 10 minutes into the game.  Holy fuck.  28 seconds.  The crowd going insane.  Carl Lamont.  We're doing it in the American end again.  Morrow is back there.  20 seconds.  Now, Johnson.  19 seconds.  Johnson over to Ramsey.  Do you let it not get checked by Ramsey?  McClanahan is there. 
[00:40:30]  The puck is still loose.  11 seconds.  You've got 10 seconds.  The countdown going on right now.  Morrow, up to South.  Five seconds left in the game.  Do you believe in miracles?  Yes!  Unbelievable.  Wow.  And you stop it as they're cheering.  You're the worst guy ever.  Why are you stopping it?  Because you asked for the call.  That's enough celebration.  I know.  But the part of it is the whole celebration that's with it.  Sam just doesn't like excitement.  There's nothing about sports that he understands.  What's wrong with you?  Now go backwards a little.  That does nothing for you?  How cool. 
[00:41:00]  I wish I was alive for that.  How cool is that?  You weren't alive.  I wish you weren't alive now to see it.  81 I was born.  Wait.  You weren't alive for this?  No.  Oof.  No.  I was born in 83.  That's why you guys don't give a fuck.  This is great.  Wait.  You guys weren't alive for this?  No.  Holy fuck.  Are you serious?  Sam, that was very not communist.  Why don't you care?  I care more.  I care.  I care more about the movie.  You care more about a fake sport.  That's true.  I mean, I wouldn't even.  If there's an exciting WrestleMania match, you know, that was already.  It's not a fake sport. 
[00:41:30]  It's not a sport.  That was already scripted.  You'd be out of your mind, right?  But this wasn't scripted.  This is real life.  And what do you mean you like the movie better?  This is the actual game.  I don't give a shit.  Why don't you give a shit?  I wasn't even alive for it.  What difference does it make?  You could feel like.  What difference does it make?  Like, if the Russians won, like, the whole world would be different.  Yeah.  Well, the thing that was.  What you don't understand about this, because you're an impressionable boy, was that this  is when the U.S. was still stupid.  We always sent our amateurs to the Olympics.  We did it right. 
[00:42:00]  And the Russians always sent their pros.  Right.  So they were unbeatable in hockey.  And our amateurs beat their pros.  Our amateurs beat their professionals.  Do you understand what happened that day, Sam?  That was a big one.  I saw Rocky.  Why don't you care about stuff?  What difference does this make to me?  I care about lots of stuff, but I don't give a shit.  This is one of the greatest sports moments of all time.  I was excited.  Most people would put this easily in their top five.  Easily.  I was excited to see Jeremy Lin do well.  That's sports.  You weren't even excited.  Oh.  I mean, it was cool.  You went to the game with me. 
[00:42:30]  I mean, I wasn't, like, sitting there like, oh, my God.  It was cool, though.  I was trying to tell you how exciting Jeremy Lin was.  You remember.  Well, I was sitting there.  I was like, whoa.  You know, Carmelo Anthony's not in there still winning.  That's cool.  You didn't understand the Jeremy Lin phenomenon either, did you?  I mean, no, I understood that Carmelo Anthony wasn't there, though.  Well, he had a groin injury.  That's too bad.  We were at the game when he fucking pulled his groin.  All he cares about is Carmelo Anthony.  I wanted to see him.  I know.  Well, Carmelo Anthony is fucking up the chemistry of the Knicks right now.  We were freshmen at the same time.  He doesn't care. 
[00:43:00]  And you never met him.  No, I didn't meet him.  You would tell him that, and he would go, oh, all right.  He would care less about you than you do about this game.  But why would you just stop it right after the miracle part?  That really was a terrible woman's thing to do.  Because you just wanted the call.  No, then you see everyone lose their fucking minds.  Yeah, but you know they're excited already.  You remember.  All right, hit play again.  Can we do this like a man would have done it?  Travis, do you care about this even though you weren't born?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Do you care about the American Revolution?  You weren't born for that.  JFK assassination?  I wasn't born for that, but I care. 
[00:43:30]  This wasn't as big as the JFK assassination.  That's true.  It wasn't.  You have no fucking idea.  That wasn't as big as the JFK assassination.  What's your greatest sports moment of all time, Sam?  Giant Gonzalez at WrestleMania.  Do you have one?  Yeah.  Try when Junkyard Dog dropped his juice.  Or threw dust in the eyes and Bob Backlund fell.  Do you have one?  That's a great question.  The greatest sports moment of all time.  If you're going to be a radio guy, and someday you will, 
[00:44:00]  you've got to know a little bit about this stuff.  Like, what is your greatest sports moment?  Maybe Sam should come up with what he thinks is the top five moments in sports.  Can you come up with the top five?  Could you come up with one?  This would probably be my number one.  David Tyree's catch.  That was big for me.  I remember that.  Because you got to interview the guy.  That's right.  Because we didn't want to be bothered that day.  I would say Franco Harris' catch was more famous than David Tyree's.  I don't know.  You think? 
[00:44:30]  I don't know who that is.  I would say Willie Mays' catch.  Yeah, Willie Mays' catch.  Or Robert Reed's.  See, this guy got chills on Instant Feedback, and he was born in 1985.  That's right.  What's wrong with you, Sam?  And then he stops it right when...  That was such a...  That's like a chick would do that.  A chick would just go, okay, the boys are done having fun.  Are you the hole?  Get a life.  You're the hole right now.  1985, you got chills.  Relax.  It's a YouTube video.  Name your fucking number one sports moment. 
[00:45:00]  Well, the Bill Buckner play was always big in my household because my dad was a Red Sox fan.  You know, that would be right up there, too.  That's a big one.  That might even be bigger than the fucking Miracle thing.  No.  Because I'm a Mets fan.  Not anymore.  Why not?  Because the Red Sox won.  Yeah.  And the Miracle thing was the entire national pride.  There's a lot of people that know Bill Buckner and don't give a fuck, but most people in  the country can...  This is big on multiple levels.  This is culturally significant.  It's colder.  Yeah, it's cold.  It's good for skates. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I care more about CM Punk winning the belt at Money in the Bank than any of this.  Holy fuck.  We'll get to CM Punk in a minute, but this is a big moment right here.  32 years ago.  USA Miracle on Ice.  Summer of Punk was just this summer.  All right.  Let's go back to the call.  All right.  I remember the call being way more exciting, by the way.  Yeah, me too.  Yeah, because you had the cheering and stuff after it.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  You didn't just have the...  Why don't you just pull it and play it over a fucking bed of jazz?  That's like having an orgasm that was starting, and then it just stopped abruptly. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  As you're coming...  What's wrong with you?  As you're coming, somebody kicks the head of your dick with a shoe.  You get one squirt out.  You get one squirt out, and it stops.  Come on, Sam.  Let's do this.  The buildup's the best part, anyway.  Huh?  You know, and the orgasm...  The buildup's the nice part.  Oh, that two minutes of waiting for the call, and that was what it was all about.  Well, you fucked that up.  Seven seconds, are you?  Wish I started.  More importantly, I'm so glad E-Rock didn't think this was important.  Enough to have Vols radio.  See, E-Rock, get with me, right? 
[00:46:30]  This doesn't matter.  It's a hockey game.  I was two when this happened.  But it doesn't matter how old you were.  Who gives a shit?  It really is one more nail in the coffin of E-Rock at this corporation.  This is what I love about Eric, is that Eric decides to bring this up, you know.  Right.  Bring this to your attention, but he doesn't have the call.  Who wouldn't have the call?  This is the...  Some would say the greatest sports call of all time.  I forgot there was a call.  I knew that.  What did you think happened when they won?  He fucking wrote letters and mailed them to people?  I knew it was a big deal, but I was just like, all right. 
[00:47:00]  You forgot there was a call?  Yeah.  Of course there had to be a call.  Do you believe in miracles?  Yes!  Nice.  I mean, no.  And then Sam stops it right after that.  You don't get to see everyone throwing their sticks and their gloves up in the air and losing  their minds.  The biggest fucking fruits we work with.  And then what's his name?  Jim Craig?  I forgot his name.  Al Michaels.  No, the goalie with the fucking flag around him.  Oh, Mark Shepard.  I haven't thought about him in years.  What's his name?  Jim Craig?  Anyone?  Eric?  All right, play the clip. 
[00:47:30]  Eric was asking me to say Goldberg from the Mighty Ducks.  It was a good movie, though.  That's a good sports moment.  When the Ducks won, nobody thought they would win.  Still lose.  11 seconds.  You've got 10 seconds.  The countdown going on right now.  Morrow.  Up to Salt.  Five seconds left in the game.  Do you believe in miracles?  Yes!  Now watch.  Look at this shit.  Yeah, they were, and of course they're happy.  Happy is an understatement.  The whole country was out of their minds over this. 
[00:48:00]  Not me.  And this wasn't even the medal game.  No, I know.  No, it's the second round, right?  They still had to play for the gold.  Is that enough cheering?  They're not even good skaters.  They're all falling on the ice.  Is that the Russians leaving angrily?  No, that was Herb Brooks.  Oh.  They're stunned.  They're on the ice.  The Russians are on the ice, stunned that they lost to these fucking amateurs.  And Herb Brooks went right to the locker room because he wanted his boys to celebrate without him. 
[00:48:30]  Why?  He had this weird thing where he was kind of separate from his players.  Really?  He was like this tough coach, yeah.  Oh, he probably wanted to cry and wanted to go be alone.  And he wanted his team to just kind of, you know, celebrate the moment without him.  And now you're just watching them celebrate.  But I remember this when I was a kid.  And it is Jim Craig.  That's Jim Craig.  And then he famously takes an American flag and then fucking skates around the ice.  But what's so exciting about sports if the most exciting thing happened 30 years ago and nothing's been more exciting since then? 
[00:49:00]  Oh, Sam.  You see what I'm saying?  Oh, Sam.  It was 30 years ago.  Oh, Sam.  You're such a Sam.  You're such a Sam.  You're such a Sam.  If sports were that exciting, there would have been something as exciting within the last 32 years.  The catch.  David Tyree.  That's a biggie.  That's a biggie.  That's plenty of exciting things.  Yeah, I mean, but every once in a while, there's a moment.  Like Kurt Angle in 96 winning the Olympics.  Enough with the wrestling.  Seriously.  That's sports.  Enough with the wrestling.  That's sports.  I'm talking for everybody.  Enough with the wrestling. 
[00:49:30]  That's right.  You said sports moments.  Enough.  It's America.  You don't even have a number one sports moment.  That was it.  You pulled the Bill Buckner out of your ass.  Kurt Angle.  Enough.  Enough with the wrestling.  In the Olympics, though.  Huh?  In the Olympics, though.  Huh?  The Olympics.  Kurt Angle was in the Olympics?  That's right.  He won a gold medal for America with a broken neck.  Oh.  Did he?  Yeah, he kind of did.  That's right.  Forgot about that, but they don't really televise the wrestling events.  It's a big moment.  We don't get to hear the Pearl Jams.  Can someone help me out with her, Brooks?  Because he was a weird coach, and I want to get this right. 
[00:50:00]  He probably wanted to cry.  I'm going to guess he wanted to cry, and he didn't want to do it in front of people.  He was a tough fucking coach, man.  He was a really good coach, but on an emotional level, he wasn't there with his players.  So I believe it came out years later that he left immediately because he wanted the players  to have the moment because it was all about them.  It was a class move on his part.  Probably had to shit.  Which was probably some really unromantic reason.  Really?  And they just kind of spun it?  Like someone had mailed him a photo of an eight-year-old.  They wanted to see it?  Yeah.  Wait.  Now we got to...  Never mind. 
[00:50:30]  Best sports moment was when Hulk Hogan took down the Trade Center.  Fuck yeah.  Is that expected?  All right.  Now I'm with you.  I'm fucking with you.  Hey, where are you going?  I did this for you.  That fucking picture.  Herb Lewis is not only coach...  Herb Lewis.  Herb Brooks.  It's Herb Brooks, sir.  Is he dead?  Vinny.  Yeah, he's dead.  Yeah, my bad about that.  He's not the only coach that doesn't celebrate with the team.  John Tortorella, the Rangers coach, does not go into the locker room after the game, whether 
[00:51:00]  they win or lose.  If you ever watch the Rangers, he just walks right out and goes into his office.  So he probably learned that from Herb Brooks.  There you go.  Fuck the Rangers, by the way.  But why would he...  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck the Rangers.  No, fuck you.  We're doing good.  My stupid Islanders are kind of flirting with a playoff spot and then decide, no, we don't  want that.  We've got to start losing again.  Most frustrating team in hockey.  What are they doing?  Yeah, they're getting too close. 
[00:51:30]  So let's start losing again.  Let's start losing.  Holy fuck.  All right, guys.  I'll talk to you later.  Hey, did you watch 24-7 on HBO?  Yes, I did.  I loved that.  I really did.  That was great.  Last year, I was like, that was an amazing idea, and I really hope they stay with it.  That would be really great if they do that every year.  And now they've done it two years in a row now.  Well, on the MSG channel, they have something very similar.  They follow a Ranger for 36 hours. 
[00:52:00]  Wow, that's pretty crazy.  Yeah, I forget the name of the show.  I noticed it on the TV television.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  I don't get the Winter Classic anymore, Travis.  You don't get it?  Nah, it's dumb.  Yeah.  It was fun for a while.  Promotes hockey in America.  I know, but it's just a game in the end.  It is just a game.  They've got to figure out how to make it really special.  It's more than just a game.  Give the winning team a few million dollars or something. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, but it's a regular season game.  I know, but in the end, it doesn't matter that it's outside.  They're just fighting for two points.  I'll go.  When it's at Yankee Stadium in two years, I'll go.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  In third grade, I did a project about Arthur Ashe.  What do you know about him besides the AIDS thing?  Tennis.  Black guy.  You don't know shit.  He was good, man.  How do you know?  I remember from the project.  You weren't fucking born yet.  No, but I remember.  I don't even remember Arthur Ashe.  He's just a good black tennis player with AIDS. 
[00:53:00]  That kind of sums it up.  All right.  You know what?  Now we're going with sports moments, Jimmy, if that's okay.  Sure.  Mark in Canada.  Mark Goblin, unfortunately.  Go ahead, Mark.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Go ahead.  An exciting moment in sports was Crosby scoring the goal in overtime, the sudden death goal  in overtime against you guys in the last Olympics.  That's already two years ago, huh?  Crosby?  What was that?  The fuck is Crosby?  Sidney Crosby.  I've never heard that name before in my life. 
[00:53:30]  You're kidding.  I have no idea who that person is.  You're kidding.  No idea.  Sam, you suck.  I don't know who Sidney Crosby is.  I've never heard that name before.  Look, you don't have to know a lot about sports, but you've got to know some basics.  I know Tim Tebow.  I don't know Sidney Crosby.  Name one hockey player.  Mario Lemieux.  Gotcha.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, the Crosby thing was a big sports moment, and that was two years ago already.  One of my favorite bits was when you guys were asking Sam football questions. 
[00:54:00]  I don't know.  Why don't you care about sports, Sam?  Because what difference does it make?  Well, it matters if you're trying to put a nice radio show together for the people.  I talked sports on the Sam Roberts show before.  Like what?  What did you talk about?  Well, I talk about it in my own ways.  I talk about it conceptually.  I talk about Tom Brady, but I'll bring in the fact that Giselle is being a bitch and stuff.  Talk about that.  You know.  I'm not going to sit here and read stats.  Does E-Rock know sports?  No.  Not anymore, no.  E-Rock whispered a hockey player's name in my ear, but I couldn't even pronounce his last name. 
[00:54:30]  Why are you helping out Sam?  I was trying to give him one current person.  That was it.  Why?  I didn't know who that guy was.  See, but it wouldn't make good radio if he came up with a name.  Do you understand that part of this?  Eric doesn't understand much.  Why would you do that?  Why would you help out Sam?  It's better to have him try to fucking come up with something.  What did you like about sports, E-Rock, before you decided you don't like sports anymore?  I used to like baseball up until 94 when they had the strike, and then I gave up.  Wow.  I just said, fuck it. 
[00:55:00]  Never came back.  Good for you.  That happened to my brother, too.  My brother Scott to this day says, fuck baseball.  A lot of people.  What about Pat Verbeek?  He was a hockey player.  Pat Verbeek?  That's right.  That's what you do to a bird if it hits itself.  Do you know what I said?  I heard you jump back.  Oh, sorry.  Call him by his name.  Pat Verbeek played for the Rangers.  But he didn't know that.  And why do you know him?  One time I went to an autograph signing with my friend Chuck. 
[00:55:30]  Whose autograph did you go to get?  God, you're so frustrating.  No, me and Chuck just went to the car.  He was a big hockey fan, so he went to meet Pat Verbeek.  You were so fucking frustrating.  His dad hated me like Opie does because I didn't know anything.  It's not that I hate you.  Oh, yeah.  It's all right.  You can hate him.  Yeah, I do.  I do hate you.  But it's not because you're a sports thing.  Oh.  Which is very irritating.  I can accept that.  Huh?  I can accept that.  You can?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  I guess we could talk about CM Punk. 
[00:56:00]  Why talk about great sports moments when we have a wrestling expert?  We can go sports moments.  Yeah?  Give me another one.  Um, you know, I always wanted the Buffalo Bills to win in those Super Bowls.  How many?  I'll go three.  I mean, three's a good number?  Three.  Maybe not the best number.  You said three on purpose, didn't you?  No.  Four.  You do know it's four. 
[00:56:30]  I think you do.  Now I do.  No, I knew it was probably in the three or four area.  What I knew was that in elementary school, they sold football pencils down in the school  store.  And I always had the Buffalo Bills pencils.  Why?  They had the red, white, and blue colors.  What a dork.  They reminded you of those frozen ice pops, those rocket pops?  And they were always sold out at Giants, and I liked the blues, so.  Why did you buy pencils in the school store?  Nobody bought stuff in the school store.  What a dork.  What a nerd.  Everybody had football pencils, so I wanted football pencils. 
[00:57:00]  Faggot.  Did your dad watch it and like sports?  Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.  He always used it.  Did you play sports growing up?  I played t-ball and soccer until third grade.  Did your father say at least get the blue pen?  Because he probably had pink pencils, and his father said, could you at least buy the  blue pen, you fucking fruit?  Does your brother like sports?  No.  Why did you stop?  He's just so disappointed.  Why did you stop playing sports in third grade?  I didn't like it.  I never liked it.  Why?  It was stupid.  I didn't want to have to get up. 
[00:57:30]  But wrestling is it?  Well, I didn't have to go wrestle.  Most people would say wrestling is stupid.  Yeah, but I didn't have to go wrestle people on Sunday morning.  You probably watched it.  I would have.  You dressed up like wrestlers.  Yes, I did.  Well, there's so much more showmanship.  You didn't have like a little wrestling league with your friends in your basement?  I wasn't allowed.  I tried to start a backyard wrestling federation when I was in high school, but my parents  wouldn't let me because they were afraid we'd get sued.  They were right.  Probably a good move.  Because you know, you wouldn't have wrestled.  You would have just been the announcer.  You would have been like the fucking Mean Gene Oakland or whatever his name was.  Oakland. 
[00:58:00]  I would have been the promoter.  Yeah, of course you would have been the Freddie Blassie.  You would have been the young Sammy Blassie.  Let's go to Green Bay.  Is there snow on the ground in Green Bay, Tom?  There is no snow on the ground in Green Bay.  Where the fuck is the snow this winter?  It's north of us.  I don't know.  It's not in Green Bay.  All right.  What do you got, buddy?  I can't remember what year it was, but the year North Carolina State won the NCAA championship, 
[00:58:30]  and Tim Zalzano running around after the game was over like a madman trying to find somebody to hug him.  Do you remember that one, Sam?  No, no, no.  I don't know.  But I was just thinking, you know who I liked?  Who?  The Charlotte Hornets.  Why?  Two players.  Why am I even asking?  Number one, I was a short kid, and Muggsy Bogues was on the Charlotte Hornets, and he was short.  And I was like, he can make it, I can make it.  You can relate to him.  But you didn't even try to make it.  You stopped playing sports in third grade.  I mean, I went to college still thinking I might be able to make it. 
[00:59:00]  I meant if he could make it in basketball as a short guy, I could make it doing something else as a short guy.  I didn't know what this thinking was.  You're like the Charlotte Hornets?  And Grandmama played for the Charlotte Hornets, too.  Grandmama?  Larry Johnson.  Why'd you like Larry Johnson?  Because he was in the Grandmama commercials.  What's that?  He dressed up like his old lady.  Oh, Grandma.  Funny shit, though.  Yeah, Dave is going to talk to a lot of people.  He's really mad.  Dave in Pittsburgh, go ahead.  Of course.  I'm not that mad, man. 
[00:59:30]  I'm an old Islander fan, though, but I just want to say I'm frustrated.  But hey, last night, Pittsburgh beat the Rangers.  That was a good moment.  Oh, there you go.  That is a good moment.  Sam, how can you diss the miracle, man?  I'm not going to listen to the After Shit Show today because of that.  Have a good day, folks.  I just mean it.  You can't diss the miracle call.  It just doesn't mean anything to me.  You're going to lose followers.  You're going to lose people, Sam.  That's fine.  No, it's not fine.  That's America you're messing with.  Well, I'm not going to say.  You're messing with America today.  You hate America.  I'm not going to say I care about the miracles for people like me.  I don't care about it.  Did you decide to stop that just to piss us off, or you just had no clue? 
[01:00:00]  No, you said you wanted the call, and so I stopped it after they made the call.  No, that was totally natural.  You saw it.  Yeah.  It wasn't a thing.  Sam said, okay, this clip's done.  It didn't even affect you as you're watching, going, like, nowhere in your brain you're  looking at this clip going, wow, this is pretty fucking exciting.  No, I said, oh, this is that famous hockey game that they made the movie from.  Do you want to play the Grandma Ma commercial for you?  Yeah, that I want to play.  This was huge.  I do remember it.  Grandma Ma, yeah.  Grandma Ma.  There was an old lady who lived in a shoe, a fresh little crib, you know, and grand spanking 
[01:00:30]  and that shoe let her do things that no man could do.  She jews and she cusses and stops dead in her tracks.  She flanks and she spins, leaving chumps on her back.  And who gets the credit?  Some mother named Goose.  Check you out, yo.  Converse, of course.  And that new react, Jews.  What year was that? 
[01:01:00]  It was probably like 94, 93, 94.  So that's like what?  The pushing 20 years old?  17, 18 years old?  Yeah.  Wow.  What about Dale Earnhardt winning the Daytona 500 after 20 attempts?  I mean, I understand it's cool.  You understand NASCAR?  I don't care about car racing, but I understand it's a cool thing.  You're just fucking with America today.  What do I care?  You don't care about the miracle call and you don't care about NASCAR?  If I don't watch NASCAR week to week, I'm not going to care when the one guy wins finally. 
[01:01:30]  I'm not going to pretend just because it's...  But do you understand that was probably a huge sports moment?  Conceptually.  Conceptually?  Sure.  But it does nothing for me.  Yeah.  What about Lex Luger body slamming Yokozuna?  That did something for me.  On the Intrepid.  That's the body slam heard around the world.  These wrestling douches.  America conquers all again.  This is what they get.  He flew in on a helicopter.  See what I mean?  Now he rocks in.  Exactly.  Now he rocks in.  Fucking wrestling douches.  What's wrong with you people? 
[01:02:00]  I used to like Dennis Rodman too.  Why?  When he was on the Bulls.  But why?  Your reasons for liking people.  I liked his hair and his tats.  I knew he was going to say his hair.  Why did you like his hair and his tats?  Because I liked the showmanship of it all.  You felt like I could have hair and tats like that?  No.  No.  Going with the Muggsy Bogues thing?  I enjoyed the showmanship of it.  Oh yeah, it's yellow and red hair.  Yeah.  Depending on the game.  Sometimes he would change it up all the time.  That's what I liked.  So did your dad try to push into sports after third grade?  Yeah.  And he tried.  I remember he was always trying to get me at least to exercise. 
[01:02:30]  But it wouldn't work.  Why?  Just to build some kind of athletic thing going on.  Just do some push-ups.  Do something.  Why?  Why don't you have that gene in your body?  Especially as a kid.  Everyone as a kid has that.  No.  And then eventually you fade out of it.  Sure.  And you get into other shit.  Yeah.  But you never even got into it to begin with.  No.  And I hated it when I was doing it.  I hated T-ball.  I hated soccer.  I just wanted to go home and drain your fucking piss-filled little foreskin.  Exactly.  You're ballooning up with urine. 
[01:03:00]  Yes.  That was more fun for me.  Squeezing the urine out of my foreskin.  Awful.  Than any of these.  It's all because you had a damaged dick, right?  It doesn't have to do with the dick.  In the locker room, they'd probably call him fucking balloon dick.  Yeah.  Or they would tease his little hot dog, Frank Weenie.  Oh, you couldn't get naked in front of other little boys.  I didn't know.  Because there wasn't any.  Ah.  You had a damaged dick.  We'd show up in our uniforms.  For the people that don't know, we haven't talked about it in a while, but Sam got circumcised  at like 20 or 21 or something.  I was 19.  19 years old. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  So you had a damaged dick and that probably caused you to not like sports.  The pee hole in the foreskin was small.  That's all.  There wasn't any significant.  That's all.  That's brutal.  Well, that's why I got rid of it.  Would that make you like shoot your pee further?  Yeah.  I mean, you could do it when you would squeeze when the foreskin would balloon up and then  you could squeeze it and just shoot it out.  Yeah, sure.  What?  Do you understand what he's saying?  Yes, of course I do, but it's like filling up a balloon with water and then squeezing 
[01:04:00]  the balloon in the water.  You had to squeeze your own dick to get urine out?  Yeah.  When you would pee.  Did we talk about this part of this?  Yes.  You couldn't just pee right out of it?  I think the skin was covering his hole.  No, it wouldn't.  It would pee out of it, but because the hole was smaller than it should have been, it would  almost like a filtration system.  So you never got to fucking just clean the head of your dick?  Your dick must have stunk.  I mean, I can smell it.  How did you clean the head of it?  I would have to point it up towards the shower and try to get some water in the little hole. 
[01:04:30]  In the hole?  Yeah.  So you couldn't wipe around the head?  Couldn't get in there.  So you probably had a cheese smell to your dick.  I couldn't, I don't know.  Wait, what's, what?  Did girls suck your dick?  Yeah, I think.  I bet his dick smelled like fucking Voss's ear.  Oh, God.  Your dick probably smelled terrible.  Oh, my God.  It must have, I guess.  It didn't after.  But more importantly, how big would your dick get and then you had to squeeze it to get the urine out?  So, while, and why did it take to 19 to go to your mom and go, I think there's an issue here. 
[01:05:00]  She said it to him probably.  It was probably the taste.  The smell got to be too much.  Yeah.  It would take me one time to squeeze my own dick to get urine out for me to go get some help.  Well, it wasn't a big deal.  You just pinch it out.  Like, instead of shaking it off, you pinch it out.  But did you realize the other boys weren't doing that?  Not at first.  You thought every boy had to squeeze their own dick to get urine out?  Yeah.  I mean, I wasn't in the business of looking at dicks at that age.  And how big did it get?  And only on the top it got big. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, just in the little.  The bottom of the thermometer.  Sam thought everybody fucking rung their cock out like a towel.  Squeezing the foreskin.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, just like the area between the actual penis and the end of the foreskin would balloon up.  And you're talking, not like huge, but.  Enough where you had to squeeze your own dick to get urine out.  That's crazy.  Yeah, I mean.  How many times did you have piss leaking into your underwear?  That would definitely happen.  Pee-pee pants Sam's nickname probably was.  But just a little bit. 
[01:06:00]  I mean, I would always pinch out most of it, you know.  His mom was just washing out the fucking urine stains.  That's why she saves the Boy Scout uniform, because Sam's smell is still in there.  Cheese dick and piss.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Gross little boy.  What about Kurt Gibson jacking that homer when he.  It's a huge sportsman.  Yeah, I don't know who Kurt Gibson is.  He's a Dodger.  That's legit.  Yeah, I don't know.  You can barely fuck.  I don't know if that's legit.  He thought you were fucking with him.  I don't know who Kurt Gibson is.  What?  I don't know.  I was in a bar drinking when that game was on.  What year was that? 
[01:06:30]  Let me guess.  I'll go with 19.  Kurt Gibson.  Or did I go back to Rochester for the game?  I always know shit from what radio market.  Who'd they be?  I think it was.  I'm going to go with 80.  I was going to go 80.  I'm going 87.  It's 87.  I'm going 87.  I say 87.  I go 88.  I was going to say 82.  I remember watching it as a very young boy.  I was drinking.  Great moment.  I was drinking in a bar. 
[01:07:00]  K-U-R-T.  Holy shit.  I told you I didn't know who it was.  K-U-R-T.  K-I-R-T.  He spelled.  He spelled it Kurt.  With a C.  C-U-R-T.  We literally should just get a chimp to sit there and hit keys randomly.  Yeah, it's 88.  I nailed it.  I thought you said Kurt.  It's Kurt.  That's a great story.  What's the story?  The story.  Find the clip.  Find the clip.  Let me see if you get excited over this.  Yeah, he wants.  You can barely walk.  Did he DH that day?  I don't remember.  No, he's a pinch hitter.  Yeah, he's a pinch hitter. 
[01:07:30]  He came in to pinch hitter.  Right.  Okay.  Thank you, Travis.  And then he just wobbled.  He can barely walk.  He goes to the plate and he jacks this.  He basically golfed it out of this fucking stadium.  Is this it?  No.  It's the plate, stupid.  It's pinch hitting.  I'm watching this hobble around the bases. 
[01:08:00]  You get fat Tommy Lasorda.  And Dennis Eckersley is one of the greatest closers ever.  And the famous fist pump.  You can appreciate a fist pump, right, Sam?  I know.  If he's kneeling in front of it.  Yeah.  He could barely walk.  They could hit the shit out of that ball, huh?  And he hits a game-winning home run in the world.  He slapped at it.  I remember it as him kind of like golfing it, but he actually just slapped at it.  Good thing he hit a home run if he couldn't run.  Yeah.  Imagine that.  A ground ball or something?  That's right.  He would have been in trouble. 
[01:08:30]  But you were too busy wringing out your own dick.  Exactly.  It was 88.  I wasn't...  Not thinking there's a problem with that.  Not at all.  Like, the Lord gave you a penis like that.  It's like his cock was like a cookie dough thing that just got the end snipped off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was four when this happened.  It was four and a half.  Yeah, but they've shown this video probably a thousand times.  That's the first time I've seen this specific video.  Where do you live?  Westchester.  You've never, like, all of a sudden you're watching TV and this pops up for whatever reason? 
[01:09:00]  I guess it...  I'm sure it has, and I just haven't picked up on it.  Because it doesn't mean anything to me.  I've never...  There's never been anything significant that happens to the L.A. Dodgers.  Ever.  I've never...  In my life...  One of the associated clips is Clemens throws a bat at Piazza.  How great was that?  Do you remember that sports moment?  Let me see.  Not off the top of my head.  Come on, Sam.  You don't remember when Clemens threw the bat?  I mean, that seems like my type of moment.  It was 2000.  That's already...  That's 2000?  12 years ago.  No. 
[01:09:30]  They don't have the actual video.  Oh.  But fucking Clemens got pissed.  Oh, I got a sports moment.  I got it.  I got a sports moment.  You gonna show us?  Chill.  Why don't you just show us?  Surprise us.  Okay.  Don't...  Let's not look.  Let's just wait to see what fucking...  I don't know.  Shitface picks.  Alright.  This...  It's a good one.  This is a good one.  I'm listening.  I'm not watching.  You were there?  I was there.  That bothers a lot of sports fans.  That bothers me.  Yeah.  Because I've never seen one of those, and you have.  What?  I don't see a clip.  What are we looking at?  It's a... 
[01:10:00]  No, no, no.  Just play it.  I don't see a clip.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Yeah, Jim Abbott's no-hitter.  That's a sports moment.  Yeah.  One-handed, one-armed guy?  He had no hand, and he did a no-hitter.  Great sports moment.  That is an amazing...  To me, that's the most amazing out of all...  Out of...  Fucking David Wells almost throwing a second perfect game into the seventh inning that year  was amazing.  David Cohn threw the fucking...  Did he throw a perfect game?  Perfect game.  Perfect game.  And Doc Gooden's a no-hitter.  But fucking Jim Abbott's no-hitter.  Yeah, I was there for that.  Unbelievable.  You were there for that?  I was at Yankee Stadium for that. 
[01:10:30]  You know how frustrating that is?  How did that happen?  My dad brought me.  I used to go to Yankee games.  But the whole time, he's looking at you like, do you understand what's going on here?  He must have been pissed off, because you know what?  I remember that game, and I remember specifically being upset, because my dad said that I wanted  to get a Yankees cap that had, like, graffiti letter Yankees, because that's when that was  cool, and my dad said, that's a goofy hat, I'm not buying that for you, and I was  upset.  Good for him.  Did you, like, ask to leave early in the seventh inning?  Yeah, I was ready to go, and he was like... 
[01:11:00]  You would have left in the eighth inning?  I would have left in the sixth.  Yeah, yeah, I would have left.  I didn't care.  You were so frustrating.  I mean, today...  I don't need people around me to love sports, but you don't even understand the basics of  shit.  Today, I would have stayed for the game.  How do you know?  You're the same person.  You don't care.  No, no, no.  I would have stayed for a no-hitter with a guy with one hand.  But, back then, I mean...  What about...  Where are you at with Doug Flutie in the Boston College Hail Mary?  You know what?  You know when I first learned who Doug Flutie was?  Oh, God.  The Flutie Flakes commercials.  And I remember saying, hey, Dad, who's Doug Flutie? 
[01:11:30]  And why has he got a cereal?  But Sam...  Yeah.  Why has this guy got a cereal?  I'm going to break...  Is this a goof?  I'm going to break character a little bit.  You're...  You're...  You're...  You're intelligent.  You're smart.  Yeah, no, I...  But for some reason, you decided that I don't need to know shit about sports.  This is not...  Why?  Knowledge.  And then you go into something where you're talking to a lot of people.  Yeah.  Like, you know, I try to brush up on shit, because you've got to know a little bit about everything.  What?  If you're doing a radio show. 
[01:12:00]  I agree with that.  You don't have to be an expert, but you've got to know basic shit.  And I try to be aware of what's happening presently in sports somewhat.  Like, the basics.  Like, I know...  You don't even know who Doug Flutie is?  You just knew from his Flutie Flakes?  Yeah, I didn't.  And what, you liked Flutie Flakes?  No, I just saw the commercial and said, who gave this guy a cereal?  But, I mean, to go back and find out...  Have you ever seen the fucking Hail Mary?  I wouldn't...  No, I don't think so.  Look it up.  See if...  It's gonna be a Hail...  Do you know what a Hail Mary is? 
[01:12:30]  Isn't that what Tom Brady threw?  Yeah.  What is it?  It's a long throw.  Oh, I know what it is!  It's from...  I don't know exactly what yard line.  But it's like from more than midfield to try to get a touchdown.  Is that right?  It's a very long pass.  It can be midfield.  It's a very long, desperate pass, is how I would explain it.  It's always...  It's basically a last play.  It's a Hail Mary.  A last ditch effort.  Yeah.  And when you throw it up, hoping it gets caught, because if not, you lose.  I learned that from my intelligence. 
[01:13:00]  I didn't actually know that.  I just assumed it.  You figured it out.  But now we got fucking Roland coming in the studio, who all of a sudden decided he's  a massive Jeremy Lin fan, and he doesn't know shit about basketball.  No.  But he's been walking around...  This is the first day you don't have a Jeremy Lin shirt on.  Yeah.  I have four of them now.  Why do you have four Jeremy Lin shirts?  I got caught up in the moment.  I'm Odell's.  Name five Knicks.  Let's see.  Carmelo, Steidemeyer... 
[01:13:30]  That's two different guys.  Carmelo, Steidemeyer.  I can name three.  Jeremy Lin is three.  Yeah.  So two more.  I'm not a big Knicks fan.  You're a huge Knicks fan.  Yeah.  Hmm.  I forgot.  It's kind of like a...  You didn't forget.  You didn't know.  I was saying I interviewed Curt Schilling.  He loved him.  You interviewed Curt Schilling?  Yeah, I interviewed Curt Schilling.  We were here that day, and he didn't tell me to come back.  I was so annoyed.  Oh, he came in later.  Yeah, he was very cool.  Did you remember me?  I didn't ask him. 
[01:14:00]  Why not?  All you did was ask him...  We started out together.  I didn't know.  He was Rochester Red Wings.  I was doing CMF.  Yeah, I asked...  We hung out a little bit.  Partied a little bit.  All you did was ask about VO games, and afterwards,  this guy is really good, because he didn't talk about baseball barely.  Was he cool?  Yeah, he was very cool.  We talked a little bit about baseball and more about video games,  because that's who he's promoting.  I would love to have met him.  He was a good guy.  Yeah, he's probably a big fan.  I asked him about...  I asked him about when he smashed the pitching camera.  All right, and what did he say? 
[01:14:30]  He said it was a dumb move, because he has to talk about it still to this day.  I would ask him about the socks.  What happened?  Tell us from the minute it happened.  Now, the guy's calling me old, which is fair enough.  Sean in Medford, but he writes,  I'm 25, I've never heard of Kurt Gibson.  He's an idiot.  I'll tell you what's a big...  You're old.  No, you should just...  They've shown that play so many fucking times in the last 25 years.  Bobby Thompson's home run.  He's one of the biggest of all time. 
[01:15:00]  Don't know.  Bobby Thompson's actually a big one.  Shot heard around the world.  You don't know that you shot heard around the world?  I've heard the phrase, shot heard around the world.  I wasn't born for that.  I don't know who Bobby Thompson is.  Who was Bobby Thompson?  Come on, Sam.  It's a game-winning home run.  It's literally, some will say, the greatest home run ever.  I'll tell you another big one.  Are Reggie's three, even though it's three home runs against the Dodgers?  I know that.  That's one of those, right?  Because of his candy bar?  He had a candy bar.  I don't know anything about his candy bar.  And why are you wearing Jeremy Lin fucking shirts and you don't know anything about the 
[01:15:30]  Knicks?  People will still high-five me in the subway.  They're like, yeah.  He's like, yeah.  He's just trying to make friends.  He really just wants people to listen.  I can't even trash him because he gave me one of his Jeremy Lin t-shirts.  The greatest home run was in 1951.  Yes, I was in a playoff win or something.  That's why I don't watch sports anymore.  It was for the pennant.  Oh, well, they won the Giants for the pennant.  The Giants live.  Yeah.  Turn the volume up on this.  Thompson.  It's a hit back.  Bobby Thompson.  Up there swinging.  Locker through.  And the left side. 
[01:16:00]  I can't be, I believe.  The Giants won the pennant.  The Giants won the pennant.  The Giants won the pennant.  The Giants won the pennant.  Bobby Thompson hits into the line back.  The Giants won the pennant.  Sam, do you know what city the Giants played in back in 1951?  I was going to feel proud of myself because I know what city they play in today.  1951 is blank-a-rooney. 
[01:16:30]  I'll give you a hint.  You're in it.  There's the New York Giants.  I know there's a football team called the New York Giants.  I had no idea that there was once a baseball team.  You ever hear them called the New York football Giants?  Yes, I have.  I guess that's why.  Well, now I know that.  That was a great moment.  A little tidbit.  Oh, yeah.  That home run was only 200 and something feet, though, I think.  That wasn't like a...  The stadiums were smaller back then.  You know, the Dodgers used to play Brooklyn.  I think.  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  You know why the Mets colors are orange and blue?  Can I guess?  Sure.  Because they're faggots?  Yes.  I don't know why. 
[01:17:00]  No, I don't know the answer.  Giants, orange, Dodgers, blue.  Hey.  Look at that.  Oh, I didn't know that.  The Metropolitans.  The Metropolitans.  Yeah.  That's correct.  The Yankees are called the Bronx Bombers.  It's true.  Do you know any boxing moments, Sam?  There's been some great knockouts over the years and some great fights.  I mean...  What's your favorite boxing match of all time?  You know what I like?  I like boxing documentaries.  I like sports movies.  Because they wrap it up nice for you.  All right.  Name one great boxing match. 
[01:17:30]  Ali Frazier.  I mean, that's an easy one, but...  Ali Foreman was a big one.  Mike Tyson versus Lennox Lewis.  Mike Tyson versus anyone.  That was a...  No one cares about that one, though.  I mean, that was like...  Tyson was already not doing well.  Yeah.  And guys like Tyson...  Tyson was one of my favorites.  But a lot of boxing people say, like, guys like Ali, Ernie Shavers.  A lot of those guys, they say, would have killed Tyson.  And I believe...  After I've seen the punches he couldn't take...  And believe me, he's more of a man than I'll ever be. 
[01:18:00]  But it's like, Ali, he couldn't have...  Ali took fucking...  He rope-a-doped Foreman.  Yeah, Ali Foreman.  Ali...  Tyson never could have taken Foreman shots.  Yeah.  So your father didn't want you to look like you were from the ghetto, huh?  Why'd he say that?  With the Yankees graffiti hat.  Yeah, he thought it was just a stupid hat.  He was right.  He was just a goofy...  I mean, in hindsight, yeah.  In hindsight, the no-hitter Jim Abbott hit was more significant than the hat that I didn't get.  Right.  In hindsight.  He must have been so annoyed.  His son just wants a graffiti hat and he wants to leave the no-hitter. 
[01:18:30]  Well, I'll tell you what it is.  It's because Sam's a mama's boy.  Mommy would always give Sam when he wanted.  And Sam wanted Daddy to.  And Daddy was trying to man him up a little bit.  And go, let's watch a ball game.  No-hitter, my boy.  And fucking Fruity's just going, I want the pink jersey.  What about Mark McGuire?  You in with the Mark McGuire home run thing that happened?  The McGuire-Sosa thing?  Yeah.  I'm aware of it.  But then it turned out he's on steroids anyway.  Well, we didn't know that at the time.  Right.  So it was fun to see...  That helped bring baseball back.  It sure did.  Yes.  It's always good to see a record being broken. 
[01:19:00]  But, you know.  He played for St. Louis.  You got Nick's tickets tonight?  I'm looking for some.  He doesn't.  He doesn't.  He just got the shirts.  Why would he have the tickets?  I got one part.  What can you tell us about Jeremy Lin?  You're wearing the shirts every day.  Everybody has Lin fever.  Lin fever.  That's not even a good...  That's not even a good pun.  You have Lin fever?  I think so.  What do you know about him?  It's either that or gas. 
[01:19:30]  What do you know about him?  He went to Harvard.  Good.  Came right off the bench.  Came right off the bench.  Into the court.  And, uh...  You know...  I know who he played for before...  I think I do.  Before the Knicks.  That's right.  Do you?  Harvard College.  No.  No.  You don't have to say Harvard College.  You say Harvard, everybody knows you mean college. 
[01:20:00]  Stupid.  That's shit in your face.  I don't know.  I think it was the Golden State Warriors.  Is that right, Opie?  Yes, that's right.  Two points for Sam Roberts.  But...  But, Roland.  Why Jeremy Lin?  People high five.  People high five!  I just spent half an hour proving I know nothing about sports.  And then...  I know more Jeremy Lin trivia than Mr. Four Shirts Roland does.  Mr. Four Shirts, yes.  You do have four of them. 
[01:20:30]  They're comfy.  Huh?  They're very comfy, yes.  They're just t-shirts.  They're not very comfy.  Did you wear a jacket today?  I just brought it to you because I need to put stuff in my pockets.  Yeah.  We haven't talked about this in a while either.  Roland does not wear a winter coat.  We've had an easy winter in New York, but it's unbelievable.  I'll tell the story again.  Me and him went to a Rangers game.  I'm fucking freezing.  I got the hat, the fucking thick gloves, winter coat.  And I meet him on his corner so we can take the subway together. 
[01:21:00]  And he's just sitting out there in a t-shirt.  You want cold?  No hat, no gloves.  I'm like, what are you...  And it was snowing that day, right?  Yeah.  And it was snowing.  It was like a horrible winter fucking night.  Did you have your ears protected?  No.  Nothing.  And we're walking to the subway.  People are looking at him like, what is wrong with this guy?  It's like torture.  And he says he's not cold.  Yeah.  Because of course, I start sweating like a monkey.  You have a lot of body issues.  I do.  Health concerns.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  I'm fine.  You're like Jeremy Lin, though.  Lin fever, yeah.  Lin fever.  It's not Lin fever.  Are you going to be watching the game tonight?  He didn't know there was one.  I did.  Where are they playing tonight?  Psst.  Do you have to ask that question?  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  You got four shirts.  Who are they playing tonight?  Isn't it Golden State?  Golden State?  You just said that because I said it.  It's the other team he knows.  Name five NBA teams.  The Lakers, the Pistons, Boston Celtics, Atlanta Hawks. 
[01:22:00]  Who are they playing tonight, by the way?  Yeah.  You forgot the Knicks.  He only knows three Knicks.  But he's wearing the shirt.  I have a Mavericks teacher.  But that's what's happening here in New York.  People that haven't been basketball fans, and I'm one of them because I haven't followed  the Knicks in easily 10 years.  Everyone is going fucking nuts.  Yeah, they sold out of the first batch of shirts when it was there. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  All right.  We should break.  People just can't believe you got circumcised at 19.  I guess they've never heard that before.  I know you have.  But I don't remember the part where you had to squeeze your own dick to get urine out.  I think that every time I look at Sam or every time he talks on the show, his balloon  penis.  I think it's funny because Jim will bring that up every now and then, just like subtle  little mentions.  But the front of your pants get...  I just think it's funny that he remembers that.  How do you...  I can never forget balloon penis.  But how...  Did the front of your pants just get bigger? 
[01:23:00]  I didn't piss in my pants.  Yeah, but as the urine is building up, your dick's getting bigger.  No, the...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, because for the dick to get bigger, I would actually have to piss.  When he would piss, it would come out of the hole, but because his fucking...  He wasn't circumcised, his skin wouldn't let the piss free flow, so it would get trapped.  So when he started pissing, it got trapped.  It was like his dick had a tight nobic on it.  And then you had to squeeze it to get it out.  Right.  That's like a filtration system.  I got you.  That's why I'm saying his cock head must have stunk, because he couldn't get his finger 
[01:23:30]  in there to swab it, and he would just hold it up and hope water filled up, which  probably itched when soap got in there.  What a gross little dick.  And your skin didn't go anywhere, so your sex must have fucking hurt, right?  Don't worry, ladies.  All better now.  Did it hurt when you fucked?  No.  How'd you whack off?  When you came, your cum would probably stay in there.  You'd have to squeeze it to get your cum out?  Squeeze it right out.  Oh, my God.  He was fucking these chicks, too?  Yeah, hold on, honey.  I gotta squeeze my own cum out. 
[01:24:00]  Ew, it's not like you're fucking decorating a birthday cake.  Right, yeah.  Fucking cake boss, dick.  So, wait, after sex, you wouldn't even be able to, how would you wash out the smell  of a pussy?  Just gotta, I mean, literally put water all over it and try to get it inside, you know?  Didn't you wonder why girls weren't blowing you?  Well, I only had one girlfriend.  Did you ever have a girl go down and be like, come back up?  No.  No.  All right. 
[01:24:30]  How about the fucking chick with fibromyalgia that you were pushing around in a wheelchair?  How about fucking weekend at Bernie's chick that you dated?  Sam is really a weirdo, man.  You've got yourself into some weird shit over the years.  Just.  You were attracted to broken girls.  Wow, okay.  You weren't attracted to any type of sports.  No, no, no.  And you had a dick that you had to squeeze your own cum and urine out of.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean.  It's some weird shit.  But we grow from these experiences.  You haven't. 
[01:25:00]  I've grown.  I think it's great.  And he eats weird.  Let's not forget about that one.  Yeah.  But it's not that weird.  I was reading an article about a woman who just ate pizza for like three years.  Great.  What lovely dumps she must have had.  We should get you on strange addiction, I'm thinking.  Well, no, I don't think it's as bad as strange addiction.  You've got enough weird shit going on in your head that we could get you on strange addiction.  I don't have any strange addiction, so.  By the way, he just made me want pizza.  It's good.  Pizza.  I never eat pizza.  Should we get a pizza?  Let's get breakfast pizza.  Pizza.  Is it not open yet?  No, yeah.  You're not going to find it. 
[01:25:30]  One place opens at nine o'clock.  What place?  It's in Midtown.  Pronto's.  How is it?  I mean, Pronto's.  It's just good.  Is it like that shitty airport pizza?  No, no.  Or is it real New York pizza?  You mean Sbarro?  Sbarro, man.  Sbarro sucks.  Sbarro's okay when you're in an airport, but if you want some real pizza, there's so many  places here.  Now I want it badly.  Go to Jonathan's in the West Village.  Holy fuck.  You have to go buy the pie there, right?  It don't matter.  You'll eat the whole pie yourself. 
[01:26:00]  I don't know what it is, but you can eat the whole fucking pie yourself.  No, but Ruby Rosa is the best, though.  Where?  Ruby Rosa in Mulberry Street.  I heard Jonathan's is better.  Ruby Rosa.  I heard there's only one place better, and it's in Brooklyn.  They're both probably.  I wouldn't mind going to the Brooklyn, but they're probably all the same when you eat them.  But I'm the asshole.  I went to Jonathan's, and then I ordered spaghetti.  What an idiot.  You should go to Sal's in Mamaronek.  I still had the pizza, but what?  Sal's in Mamaronek.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I used to love this place by a comedy club I worked.  I won't say it, because I would go in there right before they closed all the time, and 
[01:26:30]  they never once gave me a free slice, and I was in there every night, and I was like,  I'll fuck these cocksuckers.  Yeah, you want something for free every once in a while, right?  Because you're there all the time, and they're throwing it out.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Dickheads.  Hope their business burned down.  Is it near the comedy show?  No, no, no, no.  Not Ben's.  What am I wrong about?  Ben's is too greasy.  It wasn't Golden State Warriors?  I think it was.  What am I wrong about, Jay? 
[01:27:00]  Well, Jay, Lynn was released by Houston when he went to the Knicks.  I said that.  Yeah, but didn't he play for Golden State?  I said the Houston.  He played for Golden State, didn't he?  Yeah, he played for Golden State, and then he was released by Golden State, went to Houston,  released by Houston, and then picked up by the Knicks.  And when are we going to realize that Sam is just a faggot?  But not in the gay way.  Sam's just a faggot.  I mean, I'm not in the gay way, but we sound surprised whenever the guy doesn't know shit 
[01:27:30]  about sports, but yet we have his mom who saved his hair and still has all his clothes.  What kind of product did we expect to get out of that twink of our household?  I would have liked sports if my mom didn't save my Boy Scout uniform?  You're a twink, Sam.  Good one.  I mean, what kind of person has a penis that doesn't know five top ten plays out of sports?  Well, his penis was broken.  To be fair, I've only had the penis that I have for less than nine years. 
[01:28:00]  I'm still growing into it.  Yeah, most of his life he had a broken penis.  That's not my fault.  Yeah, he was more concerned about trying to get the urine out.  Exactly.  I had to pinch it instead of shaking it.  Instead of trying to figure out how to bunt.  Sure.  All right, Jay.  He was with the Rockets for 12 days.  Yeah, this guy's a fucking asshole.  But he is right.  Excuse me.  But he is right.  It was Golden State, Houston.  I heard Dallas wanted to pick him up, right?  But they didn't have room for him.  And then the Knicks picked him up December 27th, Roland. 
[01:28:30]  But he still played for the Warriors before the Knicks.  Right.  Not immediately before.  I'm sorry.  I don't think he was even in a game for Houston.  He played seven minutes of two preseason games.  So the question.  But he wasn't.  Okay.  Who did he play for before the Knicks?  I would say the Warriors.  Tell this guy to fuck off.  He's technically right.  Technically he's right.  Thank you, Jay.  No problem.  Thanks for nothing, Jay.  Yeah, you know what?  I got to go to Ray. 
[01:29:00]  I can't believe we're going down this road again.  But it's been a while.  Ray is a girl in Westchester.  Right?  Nice.  Yeah.  Good morning, boys.  Listen, I was all 14, Bobby, when it came to her baking and all that.  Because I do all that.  But how did she not notice?  She must have changed Sam's diapers for two years.  She never noticed.  There was something weird about his penis.  Yeah, I don't think your mom has ever seen a penis.  She's definitely seen at least one.  Oh, she's seen a lot.  I don't know about that.  You think she's seen a lot?  Yeah.  Or do you think that she's one of those girls where, you know, the lights have to be off 
[01:29:30]  and maybe there's a sheet in between them?  She probably, I guarantee you, she's been in so many cars where the guy's like, why do  you want me to move my right arm?  Oh.  While they're driving, she's probably right down on it.  I don't know for sure.  Then how does she not see the damaged penis when she's changing your diaper?  I'm sure she's seen at least one.  But I mean, when a baby isn't circumcised, you probably can't even notice.  Yes, she can.  Oh, I didn't know.  Sure.  Look, there was a, I don't want to embarrass anyone, but there was a penis in my family. 
[01:30:00]  Really?  Where it shot out the side and they had to do a little something, something.  But the mom noticed right away and said, holy fuck, my son has a fucking pee hole on  the side here.  We got to move it to the proper position.  That's very blatant, though.  Or he might have had two holes.  I'm not sure now.  I got to, I got to ask this person.  Just, there was a foreskin on it.  I wasn't circumcised.  It was supposed to be there.  Sam, your mom should have noticed your penis was fucking damaged.  Maybe she.  I'm not noticing. 
[01:30:30]  They probably both noticed.  They just like to look at it.  Yeah, I bet you that they would take pictures of it and send it out and get good ones and  trade for it.  That was gold on the market?  Yeah, it sure was.  She looked bigger.  They would always make him pee into it.  It would look swollen.  Just a tip, though.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm with Ray.  I blame your mom on this.  Well, you and Ray can do whatever you want.  If you fast forward and now you're squeezing your own urine out of your penis, your mom  had to have noticed.  But I wasn't like, hey, mom, come squeeze the...  My kid has peed a million times in front of me already. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, but when I was one, I can't confirm that I was squeezing it out.  She was.  I don't know how it worked then.  I think she was just...  Yeah, of course she was.  Oh, that's...  Roly-poly.  She'd probably say that.  Sing the Roly-poly song to Sam.  Roly-poly, Roly-poly.  Jimmy's on to something.  She didn't want to lose her little job that she had.  That was her little job.  Her little job was to squeeze Sammy's penis to get the urine out.  Now, Sam...  She would talk.  She would talk.  She was doing it at 17 years old, wasn't she?  No.  She was squeezing your dick to get the urine out.  That doesn't explain ages 2 through 19. 
[01:31:30]  Once hair grew on it, she had no interest anymore.  She was done with it.  Oh, really?  She had it?  No, it was before that.  Apparently, she was squeezing your dick around 12, 13, then.  No, she wasn't squeezing anything.  Let's say 12.  That's fair, right?  She was still squeezing your dick at 12?  No, it's totally unfair.  It's completely wrong.  And then you were on your own?  No.  I don't have any recollection of anybody...  I think she was hoping that you would just figure it out yourself?  No.  She didn't squeeze anything at that age.  That's disgusting.  Well, she had a squeeze...  She didn't call her from the bathroom when you were done?  No.  She probably just thought it would fix itself. 
[01:32:00]  She didn't want to acknowledge that she had a broken child.  You know what?  Stan would probably hold his wrestling figures, and she would hold his wiener while he went  to the bathroom.  And you would just stare at your macho man fucking figurine?  Yeah.  I mean, I would have stared at the figurine, but that would have been after I was going  to the bathroom.  That was her distraction.  Like, look at this as I have to squeeze your penis to get the urine out.  She cleaned it.  She didn't touch me while I was playing with her.  Do you understand how weird this is?  At least. 
[01:32:30]  What?  Which part?  But you had a damaged dick that you had to squeeze your own urine out of.  Yeah.  That's why I told the story.  I mean, it's weird, but I mean, the whole thing of...  When did you realize that this is not right?  In second grade, there was one boy who looked over the urinal, and he saw, and he said,  yours gets bigger when you pee?  And I said, I said like this.  I go, yeah.  And he goes, mine doesn't.  And that's when I started, things started to come together like, huh, maybe...  I'll do it in seconds.  Six, seven, maybe? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  But then a lot of time passed, because it wasn't me.  I wasn't having any other experiences with any other penises.  And then once you get old enough to start, you know, it was probably once...  Not until I was past 15 that anybody said anything.  What else would...  What would girls say?  Would they scream in horror and run out of the fucking house?  Well, luckily, I didn't end up with many women in high school, so it didn't come up too often.  How about the boys that saw it?  What did they say?  Come on.  I didn't...  I wasn't on sports teams, so no boys saw anything. 
[01:33:30]  That's why he wasn't, because he knew his dick was busted, and they would have teased him.  No, it wasn't.  Yes, it was.  Thermometer Dick McGillicuddy.  McGillicuddy.  No.  I didn't play sports, because I didn't like sports.  That's why you didn't.  No.  Because of the locker room.  And nothing to do with any locker rooms.  No.  You might need therapy.  For what?  Everything.  Yeah.  I mean everything.  I don't need any therapy.  Just to fucking organize a little bit.  I'm very well organized.  I think your head needs to be organized just a little bit.  I think it's just too much weird shit that happened to you. 
[01:34:00]  I bet he...  Because he's such a cheapskate, I'll bet that he had his foreskin.  He liked it, because you would hide change in there.  I could no way...  There was no way I could fit change in the hole.  Just to organize your shit.  Everything's organized.  I don't think you're traumatized or anything, but just too much weird shit.  I'm very under control with my shit.  Everything's organized and where it should be.  That's where I like it.  But you basically had a crooked penis.  It wasn't crooked at all.  It was straight as an arrow.  Except an arrow with a foreskin that the arrow couldn't get through. 
[01:34:30]  With a huge dome top.  Only if I was peeing.  Fleshy arrow.  Yuck.  Straight as an arrow, but with the thing of flesh stretched over it.  It smells.  Yeah.  Carcass.  I couldn't get down there and smell it, so I can't...  I don't know.  But you know no girl blood.  We're only taking girl calls today, as far as Sam's penis goes.  I'm sorry to the guys today.  Sean and Jerry.  Sean.  Me too.  Sean.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  I have two young boys, and neither one of them are circumcised. 
[01:35:00]  The doctor, at the time that they were a month old, had me start pulling the skin back,  so that they would check to make sure that it was going back properly.  And the doctor would always check it.  So what if your mom didn't want to touch her penis, or...  I don't know.  I was a child of the 80s, so maybe...  I was a child of the 80s, Sam.  She touched it, but not with her hands.  Maybe medical technology wasn't where it is today. 
[01:35:30]  But your skin didn't pull downwards.  No, it did not.  So why...  I mean, it didn't...  You should have snipped it yourself.  No, that's not something I would do at all.  Why?  Because.  Why?  It's weird, right, Sean?  Yeah.  I mean, my son...  My youngest son is two.  His goes back.  You keep grabbing your son's dicks.  Do whatever you want.  Keep checking it.  What was your mom preoccupied with?  Because...  Things besides my penis.  I don't know.  I'm a father.  You notice every little thing that's going on with your kid. 
[01:36:00]  I bet you do.  She doesn't notice a broken penis?  It wasn't broken.  There was a foreskin on it.  That's all.  No, but your whole life, the urine had to build up.  It didn't build.  I pinched it right out of there.  Yeah, I know.  Someone had to pinch...  Do you understand what me and Jimmy are saying today?  Until you realized what your dick did,  someone had to pinch your penis to get the urine out.  I don't know who was doing that.  That's what we're getting at today.  Yeah, I don't know who was doing that. 
[01:36:30]  Your mom.  So then why doesn't she go,  holy fuck, I should bring him to a doctor?  Because she didn't want to acknowledge that she had,  like you said,  she had pumped out something that was not perfect.  Unless the doctor said it's fine.  Nah, the doctor wouldn't.  Who would say that?  Well, then how come I would go to doctors  and they wouldn't say,  you have to get this done?  They'd be embarrassed for you.  The doctors always said,  if you want to, you can.  You don't have to.  Well, they're probably like,  if you want a chick to suck your dick, you can.  That's why when I was 19...  We might have to call your mom.  I said, now I want to. 
[01:37:00]  Do you ever squeeze your dick on a Ritz cracker?  People enjoy what came out of it?  No.  All right, we got the girls calling in.  Thank you, Sean.  We're going to go to Sherry in Cincinnati.  Make sure the ladies...  Do you like Cincinnati?  I will be there, actually, in April.  Nice.  What's up, Sherry?  I know.  I can't wait to see you in April, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Please call Sam's mother.  Oh, my God.  Is she up?  Why don't you leave this woman alone?  She's got to be up.  She's probably making a scrapbook about this.  Yeah, man.  I mean, we always talk about how she's the perfect mom, 
[01:37:30]  but this is like a big fucking mistake.  No, it's medical neglect.  It really is.  It's not medical neglect.  She might be one of those moms.  What is it?  The Munchausen?  The fucking...  What is it called?  Munchausen syndrome.  Where you keep your kids...  Munchausen by proxy, yeah.  Where you keep your kids sick.  I went to school all the time.  I wasn't sick.  Yeah, but you had a broken dick.  This medical neglect, was your mother a victim of sexual abuse?  No.  Are you sure?  I'm pretty sure.  Can we ask her?  What's to ask her?  I mean, if you were to ask her... 
[01:38:00]  I'm just asking if I can ask her.  You could ask her whatever you want,  but I think she'd probably be smart enough  not to give you the answer on the air if it was not good.  I know how to read people, though.  Just how she answers it, I'll know a lot.  I bet you're a therapist.  All right, Sherry.  Thank you.  I love you guys.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go to Susan in New Mexico.  Susan.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, child of the 80s means nothing.  My son was born in the 80s.  You still had to do it then.  Do what? 
[01:38:30]  What'd you do?  You had to pull the foreskin back.  I bet you did.  If you got dirt in there, it would get infected.  Yeah, you gotta get that dirt in there.  We got Bobby in line.  Why is it...  Bobby!  Yeah?  Don't even...  We're very disturbed today, Bobby.  You're always disturbed.  Well, no, not lately.  We've left you alone.  Not lately.  But we're talking about Sam's damaged dick again.  Sam's damaged dick.  I know what you're talking about, and I have no intention of discussing Sam's penis with you. 
[01:39:00]  That's right.  All we want to know, though...  Why don't you isolate that so the next time they bring this up, we can just have that?  Can we talk on, like, a medical level without getting too, you know, crushed?  Hot, yeah.  I'm going to give you, like, 60 seconds.  That's it.  That's fair enough.  Starting now.  Okay.  Sam, I forgot about this part of it.  I guess we discussed it before, but Sam actually had to squeeze his own penis to get urine out. 
[01:39:30]  That's the medical term, right?  The foreskin.  The foreskin.  So, wasn't there a time when he was growing up that you had to do that?  When he was a baby, when he was very first born and unable to do it.  Right.  He could...  Sam could always pee.  Thank you very much.  No, but didn't you notice, because you had other sons, that there was something abnormal or odd about the way his penis filled up,  as opposed to normally where that doesn't happen?  No, there was nothing abnormal or odd.  No.  It was just perfect.  But so, when he was 17, he started noticing, like, this is a problem, 
[01:40:00]  and then by the time he was 19, he finally took care of the issue.  Well, I didn't say it was a problem.  It was one of the...  The surgery was more cosmetic than anything else.  But a kid looked over the...  No, you ought to squeeze your own penis to get urine out.  That's not normal.  But that's just one of those things.  Bobby, that's not normal, right?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think it's...  I don't...  I have no idea.  She doesn't have one.  But anyway, a kid looked over the urinal and spotted it.  A kid looked at it for two seconds and just saw that there was something wrong.  I think his name was Phillip.  So somebody who...  That's what your penis would do. 
[01:40:30]  Somebody would...  No, I don't think he saw there was something wrong.  He simply saw that it was different than his.  Wait, Sam.  That's the key here.  Different doesn't mean wrong, guys.  When it fills up, it does.  Sam, are we...  I'm thinking that Bobby's finding out this for the first time today, that you had to squeeze  it to get your own urine out.  I mean, I don't know.  I didn't have dinner conversations about it.  You've never told her this part?  I don't...  Bobby, are you learning this for the first time, that he actually had to squeeze it to  get the urine out?  It would build up? 
[01:41:00]  Wait a second.  I think you're 60 seconds around.  That's a fair question.  That's a medical question.  By the way, it's not like squeeze, like you have to squeeze icing out of it.  You just pinch.  Pinch, pinch, done.  But the thing is, no, no, she had to notice that, because if somebody noticed in the urinal  that yours was filling up, then somebody who saw you every day doing that would notice  that.  Maybe it didn't do that when I was a baby.  Of course it didn't.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think these things are probably between, I don't know, Sam and his doctor, if he has  a question. 
[01:41:30]  I would think so.  No, no, no, but it's a fair question, though.  The doctor, sure, medically, but you're someone that would have seen it and noticed it just  by, you know, by the nature of having a baby.  I would have noticed if he had to pinch his penis to pee.  No, well, as time went on, you wouldn't have, but if it filled up a little bit and some kid  at the urinal just peeked over and noticed, it's a noticeable thing.  Now, when somebody is really young, if the kid was circumcised, then he would have, yes, 
[01:42:00]  he would not have had any foreskin, would he?  Right.  So nothing, nothing would have been there.  Bobby's not playing today.  No, no, but.  She is mad that we're fucking going after her.  Perfect, Sammy.  No, no, but.  Well, you're going after her.  I'm not going after her.  No, no, I was asking.  I'm not going after her.  For what?  There were, there were comments of neglect, medical neglect.  But he said.  That was from that broad, from Cincinnati.  You agreed.  The kid said that, uh, noticed that Sam's filled up.  He didn't think it was weird because it was uncircumcised.  So that means that the kid had probably knew what uncircumcised was, but he noticed that 
[01:42:30]  Sam's would fill up, like balloon up more, which is the abnormal part, not the uncircumcised  part.  Okay, well, you just made all that up because you don't know what he was thinking, do you?  No, I'm only going by what Sam told us.  No, Sam told us this.  Sam said that.  Yeah, but no, no, no.  I'm learning that Bobby's learning this for the first time today.  But she, but she's saying that maybe the kid did think it was weird that I was circumcised  at all.  So wait, what's happening is that your penis would fill up with urine and you'd squeeze  it out.  Some kid randomly looked over the urinal and saw that and said, hey, how come yours fills 
[01:43:00]  up?  Right.  And, and you're saying that that's a mistake that he was just mixing up, not knowing what  uncircumcised was?  He didn't know his ass from his elbow at that point.  But he understood that certain things aren't supposed to fill up with urine.  Sure.  Like a clogged drain.  Well, it's obvious this kid was looking over a lot of urinals.  Of course he was.  You think that was the first one?  Believe me.  I mean.  He'd probably be trying to time it with Sam for six months.  He's the only kid I haven't seen yet.  But it wasn't like it was a storage container for a year. 
[01:43:30]  And Sam, you know, we're having a little therapy here.  Why don't you go to your mom sooner and say, hey, man, there's something weird about my  penis.  Yeah.  Fix this puppy.  Fix this bad boy.  It was never a problem.  It's still, I mean, there was no problem.  Maybe all uncircumcised penises do that, you know?  They don't.  That's the way it is.  I don't know.  They don't.  They absolutely.  How do you know?  Because I've seen enough pornography and I've seen the way that they, and I've seen the  way the skin pulls back on the head and, you know, a lot of trannies aren't, and I'm 
[01:44:00]  kidding.  But I just know.  Sam, did you ever run into anyone else that had that same issue?  I didn't.  You know when your kid has some weird disease, they always find another kid that has the  weird disease so you can relate to each other.  Number one.  Were you relating to another dude that had to do this?  I didn't have any diseases, and number two, I couldn't tell you how any of the children  in my class pissed.  I didn't watch them.  You knew.  I had no idea how.  You're smart enough to know that there was something a little different.  He knew.  Well, I knew it was different from Phillip, for sure.  But, I mean, just because it's different, I was like, okay, it's different. 
[01:44:30]  Like, it's not causing me any pain or it doesn't matter.  But, Bobby, you didn't do anything wrong, Bobby.  It's okay.  It's not your fault.  It's not your fault.  It's a little genetic mistake that you passed on.  It's fine.  It's not your fault that you didn't notice that Sam had to squeeze his own penis to get  urine out.  Everyone is neglectful by the third child.  I was the second child.  It's not your fault, Bobby. 
[01:45:00]  Are you guys done with me now?  She's a little uncomfortable, but she's also embarrassed that she didn't fix it sooner.  There was nothing to fix.  It was fine.  And she's embarrassed that the dirty Robert secret is now out.  And she comes from a generation where they didn't openly talk about sex and things of  this ilk.  You don't have to speak for me.  How would you know if I was embarrassed or whatever I was?  I could just tell by the conversation we're having today.  Or you just don't want to be discussing this in front of us.  You mean because I don't want to talk about it to you guys? 
[01:45:30]  She's probably just annoyed at your bullshit.  What?  We're just asking.  Nice language in front of you guys.  Yeah, what the hell, man?  Because you don't understand that these phone calls start stacking up and then she just  gets more and more annoyed.  So even if you were just calling to say...  Is that why I haven't been invited to the household in a while?  I've never been invited.  It's a nice place.  It's a nice place.  I mean, Bobby usually get along very well.  I know Jess doesn't like me, but the mother's...  Jess likes you.  Me and Bobby search each other around.  We sit next to each other for some of these functions. 
[01:46:00]  Jess liked you very much after Anthony's party that time.  Yeah, I know.  But that's years later.  No, that wasn't years ago.  That was this...  That's what I'm saying.  I didn't know her for years.  She knew you only on stage.  I'm a nice guy.  I know.  She knows that now.  I invited you for the holidays.  That's true.  And you said no.  That is true.  I didn't invite Opie because my mom doesn't want him around.  Is that true, Bobby?  I could accept that.  Opie, of course I want you around.  Thank you, Bobby.  She's thinking about that money that her little Sammy's going to be making.  She hears the care in my voice.  No, she doesn't.  She hears the care. 
[01:46:30]  In the end, I care.  Do you?  Yeah.  I just find it fascinating.  It is fascinating.  I find it fascinating you had a penis that you had to squeeze to get your mouth.  Pinch.  I'll say pinch.  Squeeze it a little.  And your mom just assumed that that's just how it was.  Exactly.  Whatever it is.  It is what it is.  It's fine.  You're a camel dick.  Excuse my language, Ms. Roberts.  I don't like to use profanity when you're on the line.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll let you go, I guess.  All right.  Well, I'm just here having a nice cup of coffee and listening to you guys talk about Sam's 
[01:47:00]  penis.  And my dad's in the background, I'm sure, cracking up somewhere.  He just loves it.  He loves it.  He loves when you get my mom on the phone.  So why don't we talk to him about the penis?  He starts reading all the nasty Twitters that I get.  Oh, really?  They're hilarious.  Yeah.  He loves the whole thing.  He thinks it's a barrel of monkeys, this whole thing.  Oh, right.  Well, all right.  Enjoy your coffee.  We didn't get anything done.  You're not going to admit to anything.  That's fine.  It was nice chatting with you.  Yes, Bobby.  You didn't do anything. 
[01:47:30]  All right, Bobby.  Okay, that's all good.  All right.  We'll see you later.  Have a nice day.  All right.  See ya.  Bye.  Bye.  Take care.  She didn't want to talk about it.  Why would she?  It is guilt.  You think so?  Yeah.  And shame.  Guilt and shame.  Because she made it.  She produced Sam.  Imagine if you spent nine months making something and it just came out busted.  It wasn't broken.  It took one snip and everything was fixed up as good as new.  At 19.  Well, that's when I decided to do it.  If it happened at two, three, whatever.  That's when I decided.  It wasn't a necessary procedure. 
[01:48:00]  It was voluntary.  It had to be necessary because at 19 you were still squeezing to get stuff out, right?  But you could give it a little squeeze.  It's not going to hurt anything.  I don't get it.  It was an elected procedure.  What?  What's he thinking about the Knicks?  He's just dreaming about Lynn.  Lynn fever.  Lynn fever.  There's just so many puns you could make and Lynn fever is.  Because that's too close to yellow fever and that would get people, you know.  I'm very pissed off. 
[01:48:30]  Come up with another pun.  Lynntastic?  And how about Lynn raging?  Lynn sufferable.  Lynn sufficiently entertaining?  Why are you so mellow today, Roland?  I don't know.  We're pretty fucking energetic in here.  Yeah, we're bouncing around.  And nothing has got you going.  He zones out. 
[01:49:00]  When the conversation's not on him, he zones out.  Why do you zone out?  He's falling asleep during the after show while he's sitting in front of the mic.  Why?  I don't know.  I just like, pass out.  But Lynn has really put a pep in your step, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, should we break?  Yeah, I got to tinkle and I got to do something.  Sorry we did the same break, but I find this fascinating with you, Sam.  I'll give you that.  And I forgot about that.  I don't remember ever discussing the squeezing of the dick to get the urine out. 
[01:49:30]  Well, I think there was so much information at first.  It was like, where do you go?  Weird.  I think we all just pissed in front of each other growing up, didn't we?  Or on each other.  So long ago, I just knew how penises were supposed to fucking work.  What did you piss in front of?  I would imagine when we were all just playing around and shit.  Yeah, you didn't stand in a circle with your friends and compare dicks and start sucking?  What's the matter with you?  No.  Whoa.  No.  Lost me on that one.  No, I didn't.  I probably grew up in Russia. 
[01:50:00]  Five boys in our family.  I'm just assuming we probably all just peed together and shit.  So we all knew what a dick was supposed to fucking do.  Two boys in my family.  I love Jimmy just trying to undermine my innocence.  Mine was very innocent.  We used the bathroom separately.  Yeah.  And one brother.  Your brother's close in age, right?  Yeah.  Didn't he ever tease you about your dick?  We didn't compare dicks.  Didn't have to compare.  He must have seen it while you were changing.  What about?  One time you were putting on your macho man shorts. 
[01:50:30]  Like we all slept in the same room.  Five boys in one room.  So now you're falling asleep and you talk to each other.  Sure.  And none of that, none of this shit comes up as you're talking about your dreams for  your life.  Not that I remember.  And oh, by the way, I have a weird dick.  Do you have a weird dick?  I used to have horrible anxiety.  And so I would try to get him to fall asleep and I would talk to him about falling asleep  easier because I couldn't sleep unless he was asleep.  Why?  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  You thought he was going to kill you?  No, no, no.  I just.  Jim knows what that's about.  Yeah, you were afraid that if you fell asleep first that you'd wake up like and you'd feel 
[01:51:00]  like two knees by your face and something touching your cheek that was wet.  So it was molesting.  It was cool.  I bet you they called them like reindeer kisses.  I bet you said Sam said the reindeer came and kissed me again last night.  And the guy goes, just don't tell mom and dad.  Because the reindeer kisses are very special.  Those are his hooves you feel, not knees.  That's Jim Norton's flow chart.  Let's not forget.  My brother's younger than me.  Back to molestation.  That was the humiliating part, that the younger brother would molest you. 
[01:51:30]  I wasn't molested as a child.  So you wouldn't fall asleep until he fell asleep?  Yeah, and I had to talk to him about trying to fall asleep every single night.  You should have just played your show for him.  I'm going to study you.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm studying you officially.  I'm doing a whole report on you.  I had anxiety.  I'm going to get it in a medical journal.  I'm going to be fucking famous in fucking Finland.  And I'm just going to be a study.  Is it Zurich?  Where do those medical journals go? 
[01:52:00]  Zurich sounds right.  Zurich?  I'm going to be very famous in Zurich because of you and my medical study.  Roland?  Denmark.  Huh?  What?  Finland, Denmark.  Denmark?  I thought you said didn't work.  And why no Lynn jersey today?  It's game day.  Yeah.  He didn't know it was game day.  Do you think Anthony's going to be able to figure out how to play with Jeremy Lynn?  And vice versa?  Because Jeremy Lynn's got to figure out how to play with Carmelo as well. 
[01:52:30]  It's got to take some time.  It's just a bandwagon jumper.  You don't know shit about basketball, but you've got four Jeremy Lynn shirts.  Do you have Lynn fever?  Yeah.  I'm excited.  Sounded.  How about you get so excited you get me tickets for tonight's fucking game and me and you go?  That would be tough though because they have a long waiting list.  How about you just make some phone calls? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, you know everyone.  Start making some phone calls.  They're not in yet until 10.  What?  They're not in until 10.  All right.  We got all day.  I'm going to be at that game tonight one way or another.  Jimmy, what do we got going on?  The tickets thing?  Oh, yeah.  Fort Lauderdale tomorrow, Friday, Saturday, the improv.  And tomorrow morning at 10 a.m., the pre-sale.  Excuse me.  I don't know why I'm so clogged in.  The pre-sale for my April 28th one-hour special shoot in Cleveland at the Playhouse Square Ohio Theater. 
[01:53:30]  And I'm going to Twitter it because there's a ticket link that's really long.  Go to Ohio Theater or PlayhouseSquare.org and you'll find it.  But the password is WMMS.  That's the station in Cleveland that is supporting my show and presenting my show.  Or I should say shows.  But that one-hour special will sell out, I'm sure.  I don't think a lot of things are shot in Cleveland and I'm finally getting back there. 
[01:54:00]  Pre-sales tomorrow, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.  Tickets are on sale Friday morning.  Weird Medicine on Twitter has checked in.  Dr. Steve.  The fluid will build up.  And the foreskin will expand when the fluid weighs it down.  But there will become like a cheesy, milky buildup.  Well, he's giving Sam a compliment, actually, Jimmy.  It's called Phimosis.  Phimosis?  P-H-I-M-O-S-I-S.  That's also the name of my wine.  Phimosis is. 
[01:54:30]  Sam's cock head.  This is great.  A doctor tweeting this.  Sam's cock head was so massively huge, they, he couldn't.  Oh, they, he.  I got it.  Couldn't retract his lovely foreskin.  So you have a big fucking mushroom head.  I mean, I'd do it right.  Well, do you have a big mushroom head or not?  It's in proportion.  No, but here's the thing, though.  I don't think I did at four.  You don't want your mom knowing?  You want me to tell Bobby to turn off the radio and then you can answer the question? 
[01:55:00]  No, I don't care.  I mean, I've said far worse things.  Steve's saying you have a big fucking helmet.  The helmet's in proportion with the rest.  So that means you got a big cat.  I'm doing fine.  You have a big fat shaft.  It's all right.  Sam's embarrassed to talk about his genitals.  Now, do you say, when you're talking to your girl, do you say grab my dick or do you say wrap your fist around it?  Grab my pole. 
[01:55:30]  Grab my fat pole.  Do you say that?  No, I don't say that.  Why are you embarrassed to talk about your genitals?  I'm not.  We've been talking about it for half an hour.  That is true.  We've spent a lot of time talking about nothing but his cock.  Because he doesn't give us any info.  This should have been a ten-minute conversation.  What info do you need?  For people saying you went too long with this, because he doesn't answer anything.  What do you need?  What did I not say?  I've given you more information than anyone.  Your mom doesn't answer nothing?  No, we don't give you the answers that you're looking for.  We give you the actual answers.  No.  Bobby's ashamed.  I heard it in her voice.  She's very ashamed. 
[01:56:00]  And your dad's laughing hysterically.  Yeah, he is.  Because he knows she's ashamed.  He thinks all things are goof.  He thinks it's hilarious.  It's a riot.  But I've been very open.  And your dad traveled the world, so he didn't have time to worry about your penis.  He was too busy putting bread on the fucking table.  He would tell her to fix it.  He'd probably call home.  Fix it.  Right.  Fix that.  Fix it before I get home from Australia.  Fix that thing.  It's embarrassing.  Yeah.  He had to travel.  That's right.  So I don't blame him.  He was a madman.  Meaning an ad guy.  See, I figured that out on my own. 
[01:56:30]  Kevin in Long Beach.  We're going to break, but you want to talk about how you got caught masturbating by your  mom.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think if my mom ever walked in.  I don't think so.  I don't remember if she did.  Your mom ever catch you masturbating, Jimmy?  She was right there.  What's that?  She was in the room.  I got twice.  There are two stories.  The first one is the worst, though.  Yeah, go ahead.  I used to go dumpster diving.  There's old Tower Records where I used to go to middle school and found out that when 
[01:57:00]  the new porno mags were coming, they'd rip off the covers and just throw them in the  trash.  So we'd climb into the dumpster right when the mags would get there every month.  And my first one was one of the most...  I think it was Taboo.  Like the Hustler one where it's pregnant chicks stuffing their cunts full with like  snakes and just the most vile shit you could ever see.  But I was sitting in my room, like 15, 16 at that point, I think. 
[01:57:30]  And my mom walked in and I just shut my drawer real quick and pretend I'm doing something.  And she's like, what were you doing?  It's like, oh, nothing.  I'm just doing some homework, hanging out.  And she opens up the drawer and picks out the magazines and says, she's like, I know  what you're doing.  I grew up with four brothers.  I know what this is.  And that is still one of those lines that haunts me to this day is, I have brothers.  I know what you're doing. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Why would she call you out on us?  You know what you're doing?  She should have left the room.  How old were you?  I was 15 or 16.  She grew up, or she's still really religious.  Yes.  It's one of those things.  Right.  And then the second time is when my parents were out of town and I was trying to throw  a beat upstairs by myself.  And she walked in and I had time to pull up my pants and look normal.  And my fly and the button were still open.  And she's like, what were you doing?  It's like, I'm just airing myself out. 
[01:58:30]  It's like, I got a little hot down there.  I was trying to just air it out.  And she just walked away and shook her head.  We've never talked about it.  Ah, that's some religious shit.  Yeah, it's a lovely religious upbringing.  Right.  It's horrible, man.  I mean, it was weird.  Yeah, it's one of those things.  I think I remember when I was 10 or 11 the first time, I was just like, this is all you  assholes.  No, Jen and Erie just writes, I've got better porn stories than this dud. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  I think.  Fuck me out.  I'm just fucking with you, man.  It's cool.  Thank you, Kevin.  No, it's really all good.  But I don't give a shit.  All right, cool.  Thanks for it.  I just hate to hold my head.  Yeah.  All right.  Yep.  All right.  Punch it out, boy.  Okay.  Thank you, Kevin.  God damn.  We went four minutes too long.  Let's go to break.  We're going to do the CM Punk thing finally?  Yeah.  We just went off track for a long time.  We'll do that when we come back.  Let's do that because it's a big story today.  He Rock says he has something to play in a break. 
[01:59:30]  That's terrific.  Also known as the Opiate Anthony Show.  Anthony will be back Monday.  CM Punk, Sam.  It's all about Sam today, I guess.  It's all about you.  What?  It's all about you.  CM Punk.  Having a little thing with Chris Brown.  Yeah.  Chris Brown and Rihanna are fucking mind-fucking everybody by appearing on each other's latest  song.  Yeah, they're remixing.  They're remixing their latest songs, and they're a part of that, and Chris Brown wished Rihanna 
[02:00:00]  a happy birthday the other day on Twitter, and she retweeted that and wrote thanks.  Rumors that they're probably getting back together, and that has everyone really pissed  off.  Yeah.  Why does Chris Brown have so many followers on Twitter when he has so many people that  hate him as well?  Well, he's got Team Breezy, and they love him.  Here's the thing, and this is the way it is, and people will disagree with this.  Black people or black community is more forgiving about domestic violence in general 
[02:00:30]  than whites.  I mean publicly than whites.  Even though whites have forgiven many country singers and rock singers, like Tommy Lee did  that.  You know what?  Tommy Lee, look what he did to Pam Anderson.  What did he do?  He went to jail.  He beat her up?  Yes.  With his dick?  Hopefully.  But I believe he hit her.  Can you Google that?  I don't remember this.  Yeah, he was in jail, and he said guys hate them.  But then again, Tommy Lee was forgiven.  He has a reality show.  So maybe I should just kind of correct myself.  There's something about this Chris Brown where people still are fucking pissed off about 
[02:01:00]  the whole thing.  Because I don't think he ever really showed how sorry he is or anything.  Yeah, Tommy Lee got six months in jail for battering his wife.  Wow.  Well, he beat up Pam Anderson.  Well, that's the difference, too.  Chris Brown got no jail time.  Chris Brown...  A little community service.  He was picking up garbage or something on the side of the road for a while.  And then he had his big chance.  This is how I see it.  When he went on Good Morning America, they were obviously going to ask him about it.  Right?  Big interview.  And if he was cool during that interview and was opened up and was a bit honest, I 
[02:01:30]  think everyone would have certainly moved on by now.  But he acted like a little fucking baby, a brat, and then went back to his dressing room  and whatever they set up for him and destroyed the place.  There's something about him where he seems like a brat.  But Tommy Lee was forgiven.  I mean...  Well, Chris Brown is definitely...  Like, when it comes up, he always tries to avoid it as opposed to taking it and saying,  I made a mistake.  Here's what I did wrong.  Here's why nobody should do it.  What's he talking about?  Nah, but we're here today to promote the...  Exactly.  We're here today to promote the music. 
[02:02:00]  I'm on positivity right now.  I'm not really trying to...  Good.  Then speak honestly.  Positivity is about being honest and carrying a message.  Right.  Saying I'm positive is shit.  A positive thing is to, yeah, go over it again.  Explain where you went wrong, what you were thinking, what you misinterpreted, what you  did wrong.  That's positivity.  Saying I'm wrapped up in positivity is just rapper bullshit.  Yeah.  He's going to have to explain himself a few more times. 
[02:02:30]  He's in the public eye.  We've all seen the pictures of Rihanna's face.  And now we've seen or read the police report that gave more details on the whole incident.  It was a brutal fucking day for Rihanna.  And he's still going out of his way to take like sexy pictures and to do things that would  specifically get women attracted to him.  And it's like you don't want to see a guy who kicked the shit out of a girl trying to  get other girls to be attracted to him.  You know what I mean?  So where does CM Punk come into this whole mess?  So it just started like last week, late last week, I think, with a random tweet from CM Punk. 
[02:03:00]  It was probably coming off the Grammys or whatever.  And Punk wrote, I would like to fight.  I would like Chris Brown to fight someone that can defend themselves.  Me curb stomping that turd would be a WrestleMania moment.  And it's just, I don't know.  It's just an observation.  Why a WrestleMania moment?  I guess because WrestleMania is happening right now.  Yeah, but if he appeared at WrestleMania, everyone would know it was fake.  This isn't a work, right, Sam?  No.  I mean, CM Punk already has a match for WrestleMania. 
[02:03:30]  Right.  It's not a work.  Well, I'm just surprised he just wrote a WrestleMania moment when he was going with a real tweet  there.  Because he's still talking to wrestling fans.  And so that's still going to be there, I think.  All right.  Fair enough.  So then what did Chris Brown write?  Chris Brown.  And by the way, plus making it at WrestleMania takes any threat out of it.  Right.  Meaning it's not a threat when you say, I want to curb stomp him.  Saying it would make a great event at WrestleMania means it would be a fun event to do.  Yeah.  He's joking. 
[02:04:00]  But, you know.  But he's not.  So he protected himself a little bit with that tweet.  So then.  That means he's pretty smart.  Chris Brown wrote, CM Punk needs more followers.  He's such a leader.  Not to mention the roids he's on has made it utterly impossible for him to pleasure a woman.  He deleted that tweet.  But that's what.  Yeah, because he would have got his ass sued.  So he wrote that.  That's libel shit right there.  And then he wrote, positivity regardless of how you feel.  Ugh.  Stop with the positivity.  It's annoying. 
[02:04:30]  CM Punk, contact my assistant and I'll have him send you an autographed pic for my biggest fan.  Just a little obnoxious, you know.  Yeah, but again.  Yeah, but why don't you stick with your steroid tweet if you're a brave man?  Right.  He deleted that one.  He deleted it immediately because his people said, you could get your ass sued for saying that.  Chris Brown really, he's a talented guy.  But, and he comes off like a spoiled little boy.  Like, he does come off like a kid or a brat.  Yeah.  He's young too, right?  Yeah, he's young.  He's younger than I am. 
[02:05:00]  You're 30, you're not exactly 23.  He's in his mid-20s.  He's not like a kid kid.  Oh, okay.  But when he came up, he was, he was.  He started before his voice changed.  1920, right?  Yeah.  All right.  So then that led to the video that CM Punk put out yesterday that everyone is talking about?  Yeah.  Like last night, Punk just went on Twitter and just wrote, this must be said.  Right.  And put out this video out of nowhere.  Right.  And it's, it's just done.  He put it out at, I mean, and there was probably some strategy in it because SmackDown was live last night, which it usually isn't. 
[02:05:30]  And he put it out like 45 minutes before SmackDown came on.  Well, we had CM Punk on the show.  I liked him a lot.  Yeah.  He knows how to market himself.  He's, he's a smart dude.  And he's a for real dude too.  And he's for real.  And, and he likes to kind of swim against the current there.  Yeah.  Even within, even within the WWE, right?  He's not afraid to get people upset with him.  Like he's making some shit up right in front of Vince's face, right?  Yeah.  He's one of the few guys that goes out and not many people are allowed to do that. 
[02:06:00]  No, people follow scripts pretty closely.  But Vince is allowing it because it's working.  Because it's good.  Yeah.  I gotcha.  Okay.  So here's the audio of the video that is pretty much everywhere.  He looks like he's just backstage at, at SmackDown, was it?  Yeah.  He was at SmackDown.  And this is obviously in a locker room.  How many years is his version up to?  Well, I'll probably have to reload this, but.  Oh, don't worry about it.  It's, it's, it's doing.  Hundreds of thousands.  But I mean, and then TMZ reposted it. 
[02:06:30]  Right.  Yeah.  This says 300,000, but it's more than that.  All right.  Here's, here's CM Punk from yesterday.  You want to start at the same time?  Sure.  Watch that.  All right.  Hit it.  I never intended to include Chris Brown's name in one of my tweets to start some sort  of a controversy or to gain publicity or anything like that.  And now that he's thrown accusations my way about using steroids, I feel the need to reply.  So please allow me to retort.  But I'm a lifelong, proud, drug-free, straight-edge individual. 
[02:07:00]  So Chris and I come from two completely different worlds.  I don't have a manager.  I don't have a bodyguard.  I don't need a bodyguard.  I don't have an assistant.  I have no need for a PR team to tell me what to tweet or when to tweet tweets.  And I don't hit women.  See, period.  You don't hit women.  In my world, women are to be feared and respected.  And I firmly believe that in this life, there are consequences and repercussions for people's  actions. 
[02:07:30]  And I don't think Chris has paid for what he's done.  Picking up trash on the side of a highway does not make amends for repeatedly striking  a woman in her face and sending her to a hospital.  So Chris wants to throw stones my way now.  And I say, that's fine.  But put some gloves on and get the ring.  And I will choke you out.  And I will make you feel as weak and as powerless.  And scared and alone is any woman who is in this fortune of knowing a sad, cowardly little  boy such as yourself. 
[02:08:00]  And all proceeds can go to a women's shelter of my choosing.  If you want to pick up more trash on the side of the highway to make some amends, you should  donate some more time.  Maybe tell kids that exactly what you did isn't right.  But I'm also a realist.  And I know that none of these things will happen because Chris Brown isn't a man.  And that's fine.  And I just know that someday, somewhere, somehow, somebody will put Chris Brown exactly where  he belongs.  And it honestly doesn't have to be me.  I would just really like it to be. 
[02:08:30]  Wow.  Smart to him.  Wow.  He killed him.  Really smart guy because I love his delivery too.  Because that would be easy to kind of raise your voice and stuff.  Well, it's what he said when he was in here too about wrestling promos, that if you just  talk, people will all of a sudden like, listen.  Right.  Oh shit, what's this guy say?  Is that how he does his promos?  A lot of times.  He doesn't really hype it up with the voice and stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah, he killed him there.  He killed him.  Yeah.  And he could beat the shit out of him.  Of course he could.  What is Chris Brown going to do now?  Well, he tweeted all night back at CM Punk. 
[02:09:00]  He didn't send a video or anything, but he was tweeting.  What does that do?  Yeah, he said it was a cute video.  What did he write back?  First, he wrote, the video you just posted was cute.  It's so funny how defensive you are.  Defensive?  What is he talking?  It's a terrible response.  He's just a baby.  Chris Brown is a baby.  He really has terrible comebacks.  What else?  And then he wrote, and the fact that I really don't know who you are and could give a shit  is the funny part.  Exclamation point.  You know who he is.  Of course he does.  I really hope this 15 minutes of fame is paying you for the long run because music lasts forever. 
[02:09:30]  Wrestlers come and go according to ratings.  Right, and music guys come and go according to sales.  And Chris Brown, again, he has more fans.  He's bigger than CM Punk.  But the reality is CM Punk is not exactly a nobody.  Isn't he like one of the champions?  Is he?  He's a WWE champion.  He's a WWE champion.  That world's pretty big.  He has a fan base.  Right.  And he has a fan base that's worldwide.  Yeah.  And he really could smack you like a woman if he wanted to.  Oh, he could kill him. 
[02:10:00]  And then he wrote...  And your bodyguards.  Any one of your bodyguards, he would smash.  Yeah.  He wrote...  Chris Brown wrote,  I miss the real wrestlers.  Hacksaw Jim Duggan,  Bret the Hitman Hart,  spelled wrong,  Coco Beware,  spelled wrong,  Rowdy Roddy Piper,  hashtag not no punks.  Which, by the way,  the WWE was touting.  They were just jizzing all over themselves  at this whole Twitter war  because they love internet publicity.  And so while SmackDown was on last night,  they were making a big deal during Punk's match 
[02:10:30]  about saying hashtag not no punks  was the number one hashtag in the world.  What does that mean,  not no punks?  He's saying,  I don't want,  like, you know,  I like Hacksaw Jim Duggan,  Bret Hart,  Coco Beware,  not no punks.  He's calling CM a punk,  but he's also named as Punk.  I got you.  But it's amazing that a guy  who beat his girlfriend up  is literally calling a guy  who could flatten him  without even a closed fist.  It's like,  come on, man.  No one,  even Chris Brown's fans  not thinking he's kind of a douche for this?  I don't get Chris Brown's fans. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, they're true.  They're just like blindly loyal.  They're a weird bunch.  But, I mean,  Chris Brown's a punk  for fucking beating the shit out of Rihanna  while he's driving a car.  That's more of a punk move,  isn't it?  Of course.  Somebody asked,  why would he even go there?  I would leave the punk part out of it.  Didn't CM Punk start with Chris Brown first, though?  And Chris Brown wrote,  they need ratings, brah.  I'm generous.  All right, whatever.  Fucking guy's delusional.  And then he wrote,  today will be the last day  I bring CM Punk existence up. 
[02:11:30]  Of course it will.  The conversations that people continuously bring my way  are very amusing  because, honestly,  that shit is too time-consuming  to argue with every person  who has their own issues to deal with.  You know what?  The video's everywhere.  Everywhere.  He's going to have to deal with this.  He has to deal with it  because, again,  the guy said you're not a man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're not a man.  Because now everyone's looking at Chris Brown  like, well,  are you going to prove you're a man or not?  And he said you had a fucking,  he said you had a team  telling you what to tweet and delete. 
[02:12:00]  You don't want any part of CM Punk physically.  Nah.  No, no, no.  You want no part of this animal physically.  And CM Punk isn't a fighter.  Like, he couldn't beat any actual MMA fighters,  but he has trained MMA.  But he's also a guy,  he's not an MMA ability fighter,  but he's also a guy,  any, any,  Mick Foley,  any of those dudes,  they are used to being struck.  They're used to being thrown on the ground.  They're used to being fucking hit.  Even though you're pulling back and you,  dude,  they fucking get thrown off the top rope.  Yeah.  These are guys that are fucking animals, man. 
[02:12:30]  They're really physically very,  very tough dudes.  So what's going to happen with this?  Nothing.  It'll go away.  Because Chris Brown is a much bigger guy on Twitter.  But things like this CM Punk thing  are going to follow him for years.  And it's annoying to be spoken to like that.  Right.  Nobody wants to be talked to like that.  This Chris Brown will explode.  There will be something that happens.  I think something else will happen.  I absolutely will.  Because he can't take it.  It's just building up inside. 
[02:13:00]  He should have ignored the CM Punk thing.  Oh, yeah.  He has 8 million Twitter followers.  And you also have to recognize too,  that like CM Punk is not as big as Chris Brown,  but the WWE as a brand is as big as Chris Brown.  Absolutely.  So the fact that WWE is going with this hard,  means that every wrestling fan  is going to be against Chris Brown.  Every wrestling fan is tweeting this shit today.  That is true.  Like this is the front page of WWE's website.  The number one thing is a big picture  of CM Punk and Chris Brown.  Chris Brown is not going to be able to help himself. 
[02:13:30]  He's going to do something just as stupid.  And he will engage.  It's hard to not engage them.  Can you check his at mentions?  Most of them are probably his fans.  Nah.  It gets ugly, man.  But you're right.  I didn't think of that.  The WWE is a massive PR machine.  Yeah.  It gets ugly.  And if they're fucking kind of pushing this as well,  that's the last thing you want is the,  that's all these dumb wrestling fans.  What are some of the latest ad mentions for Chris Brown? 
[02:14:00]  Look at this chick, this big fat.  What about the Bill Walton?  That is one of the funniest fucking Twitter accounts, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Not Bill Walton.  If you guys are looking for someone to follow,  watch CM Punk.  Not Bill Walton is great.  Watch CM Punk put woman beater Chris Brown in this place.  Throw it down, Punk.  Throw it down.  But then you're right.  This fat chick, Barbie bitch,  all Chris Brown needs to do is tell them haters is,  who are you to judge? 
[02:14:30]  Right.  But then again, she's a fat girl and he's a sex symbol.  I kind of get that.  Go to Not Bill Walton's Twitter,  because he had a great Rihanna tweet  about hanging with the Bobcats.  Could you find it really fast?  It was around her birthday.  Does he tweet a lot?  Yeah, he tweets.  All right.  So you're, uh...  Wait, yeah.  I think you just had it.  Where the fuck did he just go?  Oh, right here.  Yeah.  Singer Rihanna used to have the...  Uh, no, that's not the one either.  It's a lot of...  He tweets a lot.  Yeah, this Bill Walton used to fucking relax.  Simmer down. 
[02:15:00]  Nah, he's got really funny tweets.  Wait, hold on.  If you can find it.  About the Bobcats.  Rihanna hangs out with the Bobcats  because they don't beat anyone or something.  Fuck, I don't know.  Just fuck that up.  Whatever.  Whatever.  All right.  So, um, Chris Brown's going to try to let this thing go.  He says, but, you know, it's going to be tough.  Mm.  Especially because, yeah, like, he should have ignored it.  It was so stupid to just keep coming back and punk.  He can't help himself.  That's right.  He's going to act out again, and it's going to be just as... 
[02:15:30]  Excuse me.  Just as ugly.  And he is big, but he...  But you're right.  What he doesn't consider is the fact that if the WWE is pushing it,  there are a lot of wrestling fans.  You know how excited this makes wrestling fans?  I was tweeting at Chris Brown last night.  It's just exciting that, you know...  Because it's real shit.  Right.  Instead of that fake crap you guys deal with every day.  Well.  Well, yeah.  It's exciting stuff.  It sure is.  Okay.  I'm about positivity.  Shut up. 
[02:16:00]  Shut up.  Nobody wants to hear that shit.  That means you're not about positivity if you write it like that.  Like, you would have to...  That means you're far from positive.  The answer to that would be like, why are you doing so much charitable stuff?  Oh, it's because I'm about positivity, not why won't you answer questions about beating up a woman.  Not only should he have answered questions, but this is where his PR team sucks dick,  and that's where these publicists, you'll all be fucking pushed into a vat of shit,  is you should talk people about it.  Talk to them and go slow.  Like, you take away people's weapon when you open up about it. 
[02:16:30]  And if he was completely open and said, look, I had been drinking, it was a horrible, horrible day,  I've seen that shit growing up, it was a terrible thing I did, I can look back and see these punches.  Like, if he walked you through it and really regretted it, he takes so much of your weapon to smash him with it away.  Right.  Even if you're not sincere, but he's just a dummy who thinks people want to hear about his fucking songs.  And in America, most people wouldn't move on from that.  You know, you're definitely going to have to deal with people in general, 
[02:17:00]  but most people go, all right, luck enough, he fucking explained himself,  and I'm moving on with my stupid life.  And if he was smart, he would point out the fact that other people have made similar mistakes.  If he felt it got unreasonable, he would point out that other people have made similar mistakes and moved on.  Like, you can't throw Tommy Lee under the bus, because that makes you look like a baby who's just talking about somebody else.  But if you've got to say, like, I look to guys like Tommy Lee, who had his share of issues,  and you know what, he's managed to move on and live a good life, 
[02:17:30]  or I look to other guys in this business that have done similar things that were dumb,  and how they move on, there's just a way to do it if you're a good talker, and he's not.  He didn't do any of that.  None of it.  He didn't even come close to doing any of that.  He's like, yeah, and this is about positivity and about the new song.  Did he even say he made a mistake?  Did he even say he fucked up?  I'm sure he has.  Yeah, he said, you know, when it was first happening.  Like, when he was in court and stuff.  I've learned from my mistakes.  This guy says, usually agrees with us. 
[02:18:00]  You don't have to agree with us, by the way.  Let's hear what he says.  It's okay.  He says, usually agrees with you guys, but you are way off on this one.  Chris in Brooklyn, go ahead.  Hey, you guys are way off, man.  I mean, did you see when Steve Breezy was on the cover of the New York Post  after that Good Morning America incident?  What about it?  He's a pretty big guy, man.  Oh, he's not, dude.  He's in shape.  He's not like, I'm not saying he's a fucking pussy.  But what do we weigh off on?  Do you think Chris Brown could easily handle CM Punk if they really went at it? 
[02:18:30]  Of course.  Okay.  Right?  What did you say to me about him?  I said, I'm not saying that the guy...  I heard!  Yeah, CM Punk would murder him.  He's in shape, but he's in workout shape, but he doesn't get knocked around like a fucking  professional wrestler does, man.  Chris Brown could beat me up, but not CM Punk.  Let's go to Jorge, it looks like.  Jorge!  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  How do you spell Jorge? 
[02:19:00]  Yes, it's pronounced Jorge.  Spelled Jorge.  W-H-O-R-E dash H-E-Y.  I'm assuming...  It's what you're yelling in the street.  I'm assuming it's not spelled J-O-R-J-E, right?  Yeah, I've heard all the jokes, guys.  Thank you.  Okay, sorry.  Jimmy, I love you to death, Jimmy, but you're way off base on this whole Chris Brown thing.  Well, not way off base.  I just think you're being a bit of a hypocrite.  Why?  Because if you recall, when you had that thing going down with Jesse Ventura, you used a lot  of the same defense as Chris Brown used against CM Punk. 
[02:19:30]  No, I didn't.  I'm not sure what you mean.  Well, for example, you're saying, oh, you're bigger and stronger than me, so what?  I could give a care, you know?  You're saying all this...  I'll tell you why I said that.  Why I said that was because, first of all, it was happening live in that moment, and when  we were arguing, I didn't mention that Jesse was bigger and stronger than me.  At all.  The only time I mentioned that is, like, he said something nasty, and I said something nasty.  He said something nasty.  We kept, like, you know, you're going back and forth.  You're one-upping each other, or you're trying to. 
[02:20:00]  When he touched me, when he patted me, that made it different.  That made it different because he was in the room with me, and he physically touched me.  So for me, in order to one-up it like I just was, I would have to slap him the same way,  so I couldn't do that, and that's why that came out.  It's totally...  Is that Chris Brown's dick?  Holy God, no wonder he's cocky.  It's a little thinner than it should be, but he's packing.  I'm, like, fucking nine.  Why is he taking pictures of his dick?  Why wouldn't...  Because it's big.  Why wouldn't you?  Oh, fuck. 
[02:20:30]  I bet you he doesn't have to squeeze that.  No, probably not.  Urine just flows out of that thing.  Why did he do that?  This is a little while ago.  He just sent it to a chick.  And she Twittered it?  Of course.  I don't blame him, though.  If I had a package like that, I would definitely send it to a girl.  It's a little thinner than...  Probably helped him with a lot of Team Breezy.  I'm going to fucking follow him now.  So, sir, but I'm not saying the same thing at all.  Well, I just think, like, when you were saying, yeah, CM Punk could kick your ass, Chris Brown.  Like, you were actually, like, emphasizing the physical as opposed to the, you know, the debate aspect of CM Punk versus Chris Brown. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, but, I mean, he made it physical.  That's why we're talking in those terms.  And the reason I'm mentioning the physical is, I guess...  I'll phone me, sir, Jimmy, please.  The point I'm making is when Chris...  I guess for Chris Brown to have to have...  I'm talking more about the embarrassing part of a guy like Chris Brown having a guy say, like, you're a punk and you're not a man.  It's like, that's out there.  Now, I'm a comic.  It's a lot different for me than it is for a guy who makes his living being sexy and he tries to have a tough image. 
[02:21:30]  To have another guy calling you and saying you're not a man and there's literally nothing you can do to respond that's real.  Okay, I get it.  The Jesse Ventura thing that day was, you know, it was a battle of wits and intelligence.  And then when Jesse felt like he couldn't hang in there anymore, that's when he got so mad and went with the whole physical thing.  But this situation, it started as a physical thing. 
[02:22:00]  CM Punk is basically saying you're not a man and I want to beat the shit out of you.  Yeah.  I'm paraphrasing, obviously.  But, you know, right from the get-go is just a guy saying basically you're not a man.  Yeah.  And Chris Brown also makes his living a lot different than I do.  Like, his image is so much, you know, Team Breezy, yo.  Like, he's a cool guy.  Dude, I'm a fucking...  Again, I'm a mush.  You're a cool guy, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I'm Fonzie cool.  But, I mean, when these UFC fighters comes in, all I do is act like a groveling fruit.  Like, I'm very, very upfront with the fact that I'm not a fighter. 
[02:22:30]  I'm not a tough dude.  I just got a big mouth.  Yeah, all right.  All right.  What do they call you, Jimmy?  The, uh...  The cocksucker?  Oh, wait.  What was that?  The what?  The quick-tapping kid.  Yes, I'm the quick-tapping kid.  How's the arm?  All right, punch it out, guys.  Poor head.  It's getting worse?  No, it's probably healing up now.  I would love to get it punched again.  Yeah.  Why would you love to get it punched again?  Jesus, look at that bruise.  That's a good one.  That's fucked up.  Looks like an eagle tattoo.  I love the fact that you got a penis bruise on your arm. 
[02:23:00]  I know.  It's funny.  It looks exactly like a fucking penis.  That guy didn't punch my chin.  It looks exactly like a fucking penis.  All right, it's Black History Month.  Boy, Howard's done working already?  Not for the day.  And why don't you tell me this shit?  No, he'll be here for the rest of the day.  Howard worked two days in the last two weeks?  Why does the company put up with that crap?  He's got a good agent.  Holy fuck.  And yes, I'm jealous.  Because people ask me every time it comes up.  Yeah, I'm very jealous.  Well, Monday was President's Day.  He's only working two days this week? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, because Monday was President's Day.  And last week he worked none?  He has another job.  He's got to do his other job, too.  And they penny-pinch us.  Well.  Anyway.  Maybe not when we're in Cleveland.  What?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Are we making plans for Cleveland?  Oh, yeah.  Are we taking a Greyhound bus?  I don't know what we're doing.  I bet you we are.  Are we taking a Greyhound bus?  Let me know now.  I believe that they will probably make accommodations so that you don't have to take it.  Or the Obama plane?  What? 
[02:24:00]  Or the La Bamba plane?  I don't know what you're talking about.  It's all airplanes.  Oh, La Bamba plane.  At least the Obama plane.  Air Force One would have been a great way to travel.  That's a great way to go.  He's very happy with himself, though.  You got another Lynn pun?  Lynn-a-mania.  Lynn-a-mania.  That's not a pun at all.  All right.  Well.  Sam just had to let me know how.  No.  No.  Because you said.  So I said he.  I just said he's not going to be here. 
[02:24:30]  What did I say?  Well, you don't want me to say what you said.  What did I say?  You said he could suck your dick.  Oh, well, yeah.  And I said he wouldn't be able to do that.  Because he's done after today.  Oh, after today he can't.  Because he doesn't work anymore.  For this week.  Will he be back next week, maybe?  Yeah.  Will he be forced enough to have him next week?  Yeah.  At this company?  Oh, that's good.  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.  Wow.  Who the fuck's running this place?  He's got a great agent.  Fuck, I wish we had that agent.  I mean, I like Bob, but. 
[02:25:00]  God damn it.  Yeah, he does have a good agent.  Phenomenal.  He'd like something in between, right?  Yeah.  I don't expect his schedule of money, but something a little more than what we got now would be nice.  Wake up, Bob.  Wake the fuck up.  It's not going to happen.  He doesn't listen to us.  No.  He says he catches Sam sometimes.  Hey, Bob.  That's good.  He admits that.  Yeah, sometimes I catch Sam.  Does he like it?  He didn't know Patrice had a stroke for like a week. 
[02:25:30]  I know.  Oh, jeez.  This is the guy we're counting on.  It's terrific.  Like, I told him to get right the fuck in there and, you know, battle it out with Greenstein  about the Super Bowl shit.  I don't even, I didn't even hear the outcome of it.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that.  I made it perfectly clear that we were very bothered by that whole thing and that he should  go in there and fucking spar.  Did he?  I don't know.  He never called me back.  Wake up, Bob.  Not going to happen.  Dana White there, Jimmy. 
[02:26:00]  He's a friend of ours.  Yes, he is.  And he's calling out Floyd Mayweather Jr.  And he should have, I believe.  I think they don't like each other.  I believe.  I remember Dana told me that.  They got some history, right?  When I was at the compound, I went over for lunch that time with my girlfriend and he  showed me around the entire UFC offices.  Yeah.  And I remember being in the garage and him mentioning Mayweather.  I don't remember what was said.  Wait, how are the offices, by the way?  Nice.  And there's a gym in there.  Really?  Like a fucking ring.  Yeah.  Wow, nice.  They take care of the people.  Really, Dana takes care of his people. 
[02:26:30]  But I remember not.  Well, we're taking care of here.  Compared to, yeah.  I mean, some people.  Sure.  Compared to what some people are treated in life.  Sure.  Look, you couldn't really commit to that.  Well, that's a guy that cares about his people and the company.  He does.  Not just one fucking guy.  That would be like Dana White just paying Jon Jones everything and then everyone else  has to work for the UFC and make nothing.  That's so stupid. 
[02:27:00]  It's going to be the downfall of the whole place.  That's not smart.  No.  And then the guy you pay all the money to doesn't even give a fuck.  He's got another job.  And he goes and gets another job.  He fucking rubs it in the company's face.  That's the smartest thing to do because now you have a counterbalance against the company.  You've got to have a counterbalance against the company.  And that's a smart thing to do because now it's like, well, we're not going to pay you.  Fine.  I'll go here.  I don't blame Howard.  I blame the company for being so stupid.  And I don't blame them. 
[02:27:30]  I blame our agent.  I blame...  Wake up, Bob!  I blame no one but our agent.  Wake up, Bob!  How about you get back to me about the Super Bowl thing?  Did you make it perfectly clear how pissed off we were to Greenstein?  Like, I told you to?  Bob's not engaged enough, I don't think.  Mixed Discipline Deets for Linsler.  What's this about?  It's a new one.  A radio voice.  Let's put that in the on-deck circle.  So, Dana White there, Jimmy. 
[02:28:00]  They have a history.  Mayweather.  And Dana?  Yeah, I don't know exactly what it is.  But I like the fact that it's a press release.  I won't even mention the word.  I just hate this country.  Um...  Yeah, but we're going to seg right into it, because we've got two Lynn stories.  So, the first is...  Dana calling out Mayweather, who's been saying that black players do the same thing every  night but don't get the respect.  I disagree with Mayweather on that, but he is right to point out that Lynn is getting  more attention because he's Asian, because he is. 
[02:28:30]  I don't know if he has said anything else.  Only that one statement, I don't know.  I slightly disagree.  I think the Asian thing absolutely helps, but it's such a crazy story that it didn't  matter what fucking color he was.  But this kid came out of nowhere.  He did.  And then on top of it, he's Asian, which just puts it over the top, yes.  But I think he would have got just about the same amount of attention if he was just  a white kid or a black kid.  I'm telling you.  Black kid, no, because that's so expected in the NBA.  Yeah, but not a guy that no one knew about.  Usually, you know the players when they're coming up. 
[02:29:00]  You know these guys.  This guy came out of nowhere.  And on top of that, in all fairness, he put up more points than anybody else in the league  his first eight starts.  Or close to it.  He was right up there.  Yeah.  He's a good player.  So, I think...  Quit bitching.  What did Dana say?  Sorry.  Enough.  We don't care.  Just do the show.  Well, I'm not doing the show in October.  Stupid Travis.  So, fuck off.  And by that, he means our Travis.  Yeah, why...  Fuck off, Travis in Iowa.  He's worried about his job. 
[02:29:30]  See, I want to do this show past October, but under these circumstances, I'm not.  And that's going to cause major problems, no matter how you look at it, asshole.  This company has to wake the fuck up.  Anyway, so Dana White, what?  I guess he called him.  I don't know if Lynn has said...  If Mayweather has said anything else which indicates that he's racist, I don't know.  Let's hear what Dana said.  I don't know.  I guess he doesn't like Mayweather. 
[02:30:00]  First of all, what he said, I think, is racist.  He's made a couple of racist comments.  And yes, Floyd, you're racist with the stuff that you said.  First of all, Jeremy Lynn gets all this credit because he's an Asian player in the NBA that African-Americans never get.  Yeah, he's getting all his praise because he's an Asian guy playing in the NBA.  And you say that African-Americans don't get it.  Really?  Kobe Bryant doesn't get any praise.  Michael Jordan never got any praise.  The list goes on and on of guys who completely get praised for being great NBA basketball players. 
[02:30:30]  Not only can he compete and make it in the NBA, the guy's tearing it up and is breaking records, you knucklehead.  Okay?  Second of all, the other thing you said, you said Manny Pacquiao should go make some sushi somewhere.  Sushi's from Japan.  He's from the Philippines, dummy.  Okay?  Don't worry about what all these other guys are doing.  He's shooting your big mouth off on Twitter.  What you should worry about is getting in there and making the fight that all the boxing fans want to see.  Get in there and fight Manny Pacquiao.  You don't deserve more of the purse. 
[02:31:00]  Split that.  If there was ever a fight in history that should be split 50-50, it's the Pacquiao-Mayweather fight.  Shut up.  Both of you split the money up and put on the fight that everybody, including me, wants to see.  Wow.  Good for Dana.  Love Dana.  Floyd Mayweather, I think, is ducking Pacquiao.  And I think Floyd Mayweather is really fucking annoying.  So what, he's coming up with excuses why they can't get this fight together?  Yeah, he's just a fucking baby.  Because I would imagine there's a lot of money there for that fight, right?  He'd rather hang out with 50 Cent and be a fucking, and get his hair cut and be, you know, it's like, come on. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  I sound like an old man saying that, but.  But, yeah, I mean, the blacks have been getting a lot of attention in the NBA.  What is he?  That's where he's a complete asshole.  It's like, come on, the blacks don't get praise in the NBA?  Of course they do.  But this guy, but again, Dana even agreed, he is getting more because he's an Asian guy tearing it up.  You just don't see it that much.  He would have got a lot of attention no matter what.  And then the Asian thing, I'm telling you, just pushes it completely over the top.  Yeah.  That's how I see it.  Yeah.  No. 
[02:32:00]  That's why the Asians are all watching it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of, yeah, they brought, he's brought a lot of Asians into the sport now.  Like, you don't hear about.  So that part of it is absolutely true.  But I'm just saying, it's not the only reason why we're paying attention.  No, it's not.  Because that's where people get confused.  He's a very good player.  So they would be paying attention.  If he was just a black guy, they would be.  A very good player that just went unnoticed.  Just went unnoticed.  Was just there.  Right.  Anyone could have picked him up.  And Knicks were like, all right, we kind of need a point guard right now. 
[02:32:30]  We'll pick him up and we'll see what happens.  And the next thing you know, he's starting and he did what he did.  He's on the cover of Sports Illustrated for the second week in a row.  That doesn't happen often.  Michael Jordan, three weeks in a row.  Wow.  Just to give you an idea.  He's already up to two weeks in a row.  And who knows?  There's a possibility he could get the third.  I love the fact that Dana and CM Punk are coming out and slamming these guys in video.  Right.  I love it.  It's great.  It's nice.  All right.  That leads us to the next Jeremy Lin story.  This just went down. 
[02:33:00]  Knicks disciplined Ditas.  Who's Ditas?  Sparrow Ditas for Linsler.  New York Knicks radio voice.  Okay.  Sparrow Ditas was disciplined by Madison Square Garden Network on Tuesday.  I can't listen to basketball on the radio.  Can you listen to any sports on the radio?  Sure.  Baseball.  Baseball, yeah.  Baseball is easy, right?  Football and I have to, but baseball is easier.  I'll do a little hockey just to try to keep up with my team.  But basketball, nah, I never, never fucking listened to a game on the radio, even when  I was really, really into it. 
[02:33:30]  By the way, where is this from?  What do you mean?  Where is this disgustingly sanitized press release?  Is this from the Knicks?  No, this is a news story, so it must be AP or something.  Look at the way these, nah, I would say AP, but look at the way these fucking pussies,  look at the, where is this from, Travis?  Fox Sports.  Fox Sports.  Look at the way these pussy sports people write this story.  Because everyone's scared.  Everyone's fucking scared out there.  Did he say chink?  Did he say the word chink?  Everyone's scared.  God almighty. 
[02:34:00]  If he said the word chink, wrote, right, he said the word chink, you're the news, don't  make us guess.  God, what fucking pussies.  You're reporting a story that happened.  If a woman was raped, would you put, she was R, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, D?  God almighty, what fucking cocksuckers.  Screaming, sorry.  Ah, really fast.  I gotta go to Ricky, California.  Rick, go ahead.  Hey guys, check it out.  Playmobil is way over to such a douchebag. 
[02:34:30]  If this is a black guy in hockey that just went off, just out of nowhere, came out from  minor, scored 40 or 50 goals, ESPN, it'll be all over the freaking place.  Yep, absolutely.  This dude was going crazy and he was black.  So maybe let's just shut his fucking mouth and just, you know, worry about being whatever  he is right now.  I think Mayweather just didn't have enough knowledge to understand that this kid really  did just come out of nowhere.  You know, that's the key to the story.  I mean, even if it's a black hockey player, it has to be a black hockey player that just 
[02:35:00]  kind of went unnoticed and all of a sudden was brought up and then was like, you know,  the sensation.  It's jealousy.  It's taken all the attention away from, you know, maybe a black like Chris Paul, what  he's doing with the Clippers out here or something else.  Now all of a sudden, Jeremy Lin.  Look, there's a few guys that are jealous because he did get a shitload of attention.  One of the guys, Deron Williams from the Nets, who arguably is the best point guard in the  NBA right now, he was like, I'm over this Lin shit. 
[02:35:30]  But the Lin sanity crap started when the Knicks played the Nets the first time around.  Fucking Lin had a much better game than Deron Williams.  But Deron Williams is like, fuck you, man.  I do do this every night and I'm considered the best point guard in the league and I don't  get, you know, the headlines this kid's getting.  But the reason he did was because he came out of fucking nowhere.  Yeah, I agree.  Check it out.  You know, it's earned praise.  It's not like the guy still isn't scoring 25 a night or getting 25 and 10 every night. 
[02:36:00]  He's still putting out.  So it hasn't, even though it's only been 10 games, he still isn't, you know, just turning  back to a guy that's scoring 12 and getting five assists and turning the ball over all  the place.  He's still earning the praise.  And in a way, it's too bad that he is Asian because people are focusing on that maybe a  little too much too, you know?  Absolutely.  It's almost too bad it's working against him because he's just a fucking human being  that just is doing an amazing thing here right now. 
[02:36:30]  Absolutely.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  All right.  So the Knicks radio announcer, Discipline by Madison Square Garden Network, on Tuesday  after it emerged, he uttered the same phrase used by two ESPN employees on Friday night  during Jeremy Lin's first loss as a starter against the Hornets.  And that phrase would have been chink in the armor.  But look at the next paragraph, the way they phrase it.  ESPN fired a headline writer for using the phrase, which carries obvious racial overtones  when used in reference to a person of Asian descent on the Knicks game story on its website 
[02:37:00]  and suspended an anchor for putting the phrase in a question he asked about Lin's weakness  during an interview with Hall of Fame Knicks guard, Walt Frazier.  That is one long fucking sentence right there.  These fucking cowards won't even write the word in a legitimate news story context.  Yeah, if it's a news story, that's where you should absolutely be safe, right?  What fucking cowards?  Or even scared to fucking write it in a news story.  Oh, I just can't stand the way they dance.  Or even just like C-dash-dash. 
[02:37:30]  Just the word is chink.  The phrase is chink in the armor.  That was one long run-on sentence to try to explain that it was chink in the armor,  which carries obvious racial overtones when used in reference to a person of Asian descent.  Say it, chink in the armor, you faggots.  You know, someone, and I never know when I'm going here,  and I should start writing this shit down,  but someone on Twitter helped me out and found a headline about Tiger Woods.  Oh, you got that too, where it said chink in the armor. 
[02:38:00]  And he is part Asian too.  So you've got to save these tweets.  So why the fuck was there no uproar there?  Because it's a legitimate phrase.  And no one thought about Tiger is Asian.  Wanda Sykes had a really funny joke about how, back, this is years ago,  how everybody was saying that he's part Asian, golfer Asian.  She's like saying that everyone's trying to claim him because he's so good.  She goes, let him get in trouble.  Let him get arrested.  They'll say black golfer arrested.  It was a very funny bit, and she was right.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'll be honest.  I don't think I ever heard chink in the armor before. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, God, yeah.  The more I think about it, I always heard kink.  No, I always heard chink.  Yeah, I always heard chink.  I always heard kink in the armor.  Because a chink is like a little thing chipped with that, chipped out of it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, what has chink in armor?  There it is.  Headline from 2003 when he was playing the Masters, it looks like,  because it's out of Augusta.  The term Spurrow Deeds, unintentionally and inadvertently used  during a recent live radio broadcast, was inappropriate and inconsistent  with the high regard we have for Jeremy Lin as a member of our MSG family 
[02:39:00]  as well as the Asian community.  MSG said in a statement,  a bunch of fucking pussies.  Why don't you stick up for your fucking guy  if a chink in the armor is used a lot?  Don't you love how they say he unintentionally used it?  No, he intentionally used that phrase.  But not to be hateful, just because everyone is punting their asses off.  And he goes, ah, chink in the armor, this is a perfect tie-in.  Perfect.  So all you people out there, until you start screaming about this stuff,  we're going to have to live with this politically correct nonsense. 
[02:39:30]  You want to hear how it came across on the broadcast?  It'd be funny if it's really mean.  And the chink scores a goal!  So for the first time in what has been a remarkable two-week run,  Jeremy Lin shows a chink in the armor.  The Knicks' seven-game winning streak ends against the Hornets  as they fall for the first time since February the 3rd.  Nine turnovers committed by Lin.  And your final score, the New Orleans Hornets, 89.  And the New York Knicks, 85.  They didn't fire this guy, right?  No. 
[02:40:00]  All right, good.  Do you know what?  Do you think that people don't even realize it?  Like, is it a desire to say something fucked up and not even realizing it?  Like, are you saying chink?  Because like I said when I was a little kid, you wanted to say the bad word.  Is that...  I've heard...  I didn't know this guy's name.  How could it be?  I didn't know this guy's name, but I've heard his voice many, many fucking times  when they play a clip here and there on like 1010 Winds or whatever.  He's like a traditional broadcaster.  No, but I've never heard chink in the armor, though.  He's not going to go for... 
[02:40:30]  In sports, it's used a lot.  Yeah, but...  He's not going to go for...  He's not going to go for an edgy thing.  He just totally assumed he could easily just say this.  No, no.  I don't mean edgy.  I can't say I've never heard it, but I don't hear it that often.  It's an expression I'm familiar with, but I don't...  It doesn't register to me.  And now, all of a sudden, when referencing the Asian guy, this guy uses it, ESPN writes  it, and the ESPN guy says it.  Like, why...  And I don't think that was ever said about Derek Jeter three times in a week.  Not for any reasons other than it's just not the most common phrase. 
[02:41:00]  Weakness in his game is what people would say more commonly with sports.  It's like, I guess he's got a hole in his game or a weakness in his game.  Chink in the armor is one, but it's almost happening too fast where people don't even  realize they're doing it, but that word is lurking.  So the difference between saying he's got a weakness in his game and a chink in the armor  is that sports guys love puns.  Yeah.  They live for puns.  They live for puns.  I don't think they're trying to be edgy, but this is here. 
[02:41:30]  It's almost like there's a part of them that needs to get it out.  They say, chink!  The chink is scoring!  It's like they want to say it.  I think if I'm a traditional broadcaster like this guy, that would raise a red flag  in my brain saying chink in the armor just knowing he's Asian.  And now that phrase won't be used for any player.  We would do it just to be idiots, but I mean, if you're traditional and not really going  for shocking or any of that shit, I would assume that that would raise some kind of  red flag, you know? 
[02:42:00]  But for some reason, it's not.  Because what you say, they use it a lot.  But I've never heard chink in the armor.  I'm telling you.  I mean, look, in this situation where they had won X amount of games and...  Outside of Tiger and Jeremy Lin, could you find another time they...  I'm sure I could.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Football, absolutely.  Yeah.  You go on a winning streak and everything's great and then, you know, some team beats you.  Here's the other part of the story, too.  All these sports guys that are close to this, they were waiting for Jeremy Lin to have that  one bad game.  They couldn't wait because that's a story in itself. 
[02:42:30]  So they already were prepared and ready to go with chink in the armor.  You know what I mean?  Like, what are we going to say when he has that first bad game?  They love the fall as much as the rap.  Absolutely.  By the way, do you know what I think of when I think of that phrase and why, for me, it's  just...  It's one that I...  I kind of think I'm contradicting myself.  I haven't heard it, but I've never...  The 12-step program I go to, in one of the steps, they're talking about newcomers.  And they're saying...  They're talking about different types of people that get sober.  Some are very needy and vulnerable.  And they said they're talking about the other kind. 
[02:43:00]  They said, and some very rarely need comforting.  And the job of people who are helping them is to find the chink in their armor through  which the light of reason can shine.  Like, that's what I...  That's immediately what I think of when I hear that phrase.  So to me, it's a very...  I guess because I've read through that step hundreds of times in my life.  Right.  And I've read that phrase hundreds of times.  Watch someone call me a crackling and go, no, it's kink.  I've heard kink over the years.  I'm just amazed I've never heard chink in the armor.  I've never heard kink in the armor that I can think of. 
[02:43:30]  I haven't either.  Is it a legit phrase?  Kink in the armor?  I don't think so.  I've never heard kink in the armor.  You probably heard of this.  You probably heard kink and heard kink.  Wow.  Does it come up?  Well, more to the story as you try to find that.  Sparrow deeply regrets the error and never intended to offend anyone.  I believe that.  Mostly these apologies are bullshit, but I believe that.  Because he's like a traditional broadcaster.  Most particularly Jeremy, whom he holds in high esteem.  We took appropriate disciplinary action in dealing with this matter, 
[02:44:00]  but we'll keep details internal to the organization.  Deeds released his own comment through the Knicks,  which said, I'm deeply sorry that my unfortunate choice of words offended anyone.  It was completely unintentional.  I have apologized to Jeremy, and I apologize to the Asian community.  If others were offended, I will be much more sensitive to my choice of words moving forward.  So there you go.  I mean, kink in the armor is all fucking limits with this Jeremy Lin. 
[02:44:30]  Jeremy's been getting a lot of phone calls apologizing for kink in the armor.  He's like, shut up.  I'm trying to find a place to live.  Although he's got some great places to live now.  No more couch for Jeremy Lin.  If you look close, it looks like he has bed bug bites, by the way.  He was slut.  From the couch.  I'm thinking.  It was from the armor.  Either that or they're scratching him a lot on the court.  Look closely tonight when they play the Hawks.  He's got a lot of fucking marks on him.  They are playing him fucking tough.  Very physical.  They're having people use kink in the armor.  You're not crazy. 
[02:45:00]  They've used kink in the armor, right?  Yeah, they've used both.  They've used both.  Hmm.  I swear to you, I'm trying to remember ever hearing kink in the armor before this German  I've never heard kink in the armor.  We ought to just all get out and just talk about this naked.  What?  Just fucking figure it out.  Why does it have to be naked?  I don't know.  It'd be so raw.  A bunch of guys sitting around with our fucking balls hanging out, talking about what we've  heard and haven't heard.  Dr. Gay has a boner.  Now they're saying Sparrow got a DWI earlier this year.  I don't know that. 
[02:45:30]  This guy's saying it.  Oh.  Made the Knicks look bad.  Knicks looking at Canham.  Was that in the story?  Yeah.  I read the whole story.  No, you didn't.  I read the highlighted part.  Well, that's the important part, yeah.  Kink in the chain.  Yeah.  Kink in the armor.  Sam backed me up, said that the kink in the armor is also.  Yeah.  July 4th.  July 4th weekend.  Yeah, but that's a freebie day.  Yeah.  You shouldn't be able to, you shouldn't be, nah, you shouldn't get a DWI on 4th of July.  That's right after he, uh. 
[02:46:00]  You shouldn't get a DWI on 4th of July or New Year's Eve.  That sounds like probably one of the most drunk driving accidents would happen.  That's why I fucking stay off the road.  Thanksgiving Eve.  Let the drunks figure it out.  Let them fucking bumper car themselves all over the place.  Yeah.  I gotta get home sometime.  You drive around on New Year's Eve?  What are you, crazy?  Yeah, I had to drive home.  Yeah.  I drove home on New Year's Eve.  I drove home from the city.  Where were you?  Your house.  You were at my house for New Year's Eve?  Yeah.  Was I there?  Yeah, well, kind of.  Were you, did you have a good time? 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, me and Jess and your wife and.  And what did I do?  Was it Jim?  Jim was there.  You were there, Jim?  You were on Twitter.  I was tweeting?  Yeah, yeah.  You had some good tweets.  I mean, I checked when I got home.  You were tweeting from the couch, too.  Nothing better than getting people over my house and everyone's just tweeting from their part  of the couch.  I think a kink in the armor refers to, like, the chainmail under armor, whereas a chink  in the armor...  Yes, we've already established this. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Sorry, I couldn't let you just finish.  Like, I've never repeated myself on this show.  We got Brother Joe.  We're down one kumia, but we got a replacement kumia on the line.  Joe, what's up, Joe?  What's up?  More masculine of the kumias.  What's up, brother?  The slang term chink refers specifically to Chinese, not to any old run-of-the-mill Asian.  In other words, a Vietnamese gentleman might be referred to as a slope.  A Japanese gentleman may be referred to as a slant. 
[02:47:30]  But specifically, chink is reserved for Chinese gentlemen.  Yeah, but that's if you could tell all those people apart.  Well, the bottom line is, though, I mean, if there were chink in the armor, that would  mean that he's still protected.  Now, if he said, looks like the chink's out of the armor, then there might be a problem.  I mean, you know, I don't think he said it, you know, to refer to him as a chink. 
[02:48:00]  Chink in the armor, I've heard a billion times.  It's a common term, you know, for a weak point.  I really do.  I really think that people have it on their mind and don't even realize they do, only  because it's happening so much.  It's like, I've never heard it used about any player that much in like a two or three  day period.  I think it's in people's mind, like that naughty part of you, and you don't even realize  it.  Like when you see a woman who's misbehaving, the first thing you say is, cunt, and you  can't say it, but you think it.  That's that racist part of us, where you just, you don't want to call a guy a chink, 
[02:48:30]  but the word is there.  It's like the one word you don't want to slip out.  Right.  Yeah.  The boy that's in the, that got himself in trouble, though, I don't think, I don't think  it was a purpose.  I don't think it was on purpose.  No, I don't think so either.  It's really a slip.  I think because, you know, they live in a pun world.  They're all, they all come up with their puns, and this one was an obvious one that they  just went with.  It's more the situation.  Right.  Everybody's like, oh, he finally lost.  Yeah, chink in the armor, but I'm not saying, you know, he's a, he's a chink.  I see Jim's point, though.  Yeah.  It is.  Joe, where are you going to be, brother?  At least three. 
[02:49:00]  Coming up, too.  Coming up Thursday, we're at the Red Lion downtown at Atten.  Nice.  Thursday night.  Very good.  We're at 10 o'clock.  All right, gentlemen.  Take care, brother.  Thanks, Joe.  Talk to you soon, guys.  See you, man.  Brother Joe.  Leno said chink in the armor.  Did he?  I don't know.  Let's find out.  Adam in Illinois.  Adam.  Hey, how we doing, guys?  Hey.  Leno last week, I think, said chink in the armor during his monologue.  It was the night he had Tyler Perry on.  And I don't know exactly which night it was.  Was he talking about?  Was he making it?  He wasn't talking about Jeremy Lin, but he did say it. 
[02:49:30]  It's an allowable phrase.  And just because, no, I'm not yelling at you, sir.  I understand that.  I'm just saying that Jimmy said he's never heard it.  I'm just saying, you know.  I shouldn't have said I've never heard it.  What I was saying, and I was wrong to say I've never heard it.  What I was talking about was, it's not something I hear commonly.  I shouldn't have said that.  I don't hear it commonly.  And I guess when I hear it, it doesn't even really register.  And then I kind of explain why I said that.  Because I've read the phrase so many times in that step.  And I've heard it in certain meetings and talking about, you know, whatever. 
[02:50:00]  You discuss the step.  So to me, it's a very common phrase.  But I just don't remember hearing it that often in reference to sports.  I think you're hearing it a lot more now.  I don't think anybody ever paid attention to it before.  Yeah, maybe we just heard it a lot and just didn't think twice.  Because I just don't remember really hearing that in sports.  But everyone's coming forward and saying, no, man, you know, it's used a lot.  But maybe that's what it is.  The way they wrote it in Fox Sports, that politically correct fucking pussy, sanitized way of writing in this country. 
[02:50:30]  It makes me just fucking hate everybody.  Yeah, it's a news story.  Fucking print what the problem was.  And you don't have to write it.  Like, they don't write the word nigger like they put an N.  And I understand that.  Like, you don't want to just put – they can't put cunt.  They can't – fine.  But at least put, like you said, the word –  Blike in the armor.  Yeah.  Just put children.  And then people go, oh, that again.  Chink, yeah.  We're just a country of children.  They have no problem saying N-word, N-word, N-word, you know, in any article. 
[02:51:00]  Well, they know C-word.  Like Ope said, the cunts have taken C-word.  So this is the C-H word.  Or this is the – when you say, could you – this is the C-word and then you make  your eyes.  You pull your eyes back like in the stereotypical Chinese way.  How can we sanitize it in America, but we know we're talking about the Asian and not  the cunts?  We like to do that.  But we sanitize it, making it okay, I guess.  Really?  Is it okay then?  It's amazing.  You can say N-word all the time now.  It's still the same problem.  It's acceptable to say – they have made it where you can say it.  People think nigger, but they don't say it. 
[02:51:30]  Right.  But as soon as you say N-word, everyone's like, oh, shit, he just said the N-word.  They'll say it on the news.  They'll say coming up a show with a lot of really fun N-words.  Right.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  I guess East Pounding Down uses Chink in the Armor a lot.  I did not know that, and I like that show.  I'll have to fucking pay more –  And that's about sports.  Yeah, pay closer attention.  Let me say hi to Graham in Wisconsin.  Graham.  Yeah, everybody knows Opie's right.  You pointed this out before.  It's definitely Kink in the Armor, just like it's amber waves of gray. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, it is.  But that is that song.  Gray skies.  There's a lot of bombs flying.  I don't know about that.  What's the real word?  Grain.  The waves of gray.  The waves of grain in the wind.  I'm the only one that thought that was gray.  You are – absolutely.  Yeah.  You sure?  What's your favorite Dead song, A Touch of Grain?  You sure, though?  Come on.  Half those songs were fucking made when they were looking at the sky when shit was going down.  Let's talk about this.  I mean, I thought – 
[02:52:30]  Gray skies.  I get it.  I thought it was grain.  You thought it was grain?  Grain, yeah.  Not gray?  No, I never thought it was gray.  But that's just me.  You didn't think it was grain.  You knew.  I knew.  Not one person's with me on this, huh?  No, nobody in this industry has ever –  Not a one?  Not a one.  You thought it was gray or –  He doesn't know it was.  No.  How the fuck did I graduate high school?  That's what I got to ask myself.  How the fuck did I do that?  He didn't know what we were talking about?  No.  I didn't start cheating until college, so I understand why I got through college.  But high school, I didn't fucking cheat.  You didn't?  Well – 
[02:53:00]  Here and there.  Cheat sheets every once in a while.  That's cheating.  But who didn't?  Little little facts on tiny little pieces of paper that fit under your thumb.  I graduated high school in summer school.  It's like extra school.  Did you cheat?  No, I just didn't do well.  Oh.  I did a lot of cheating.  My senior year, I was in the junior class section of the yearbook and the senior class section of the yearbook.  My best cheating story, and I'm amazed I got away with this, I set up everything nice in the bathroom. 
[02:53:30]  Nice.  Notes all over the fucking place.  And then in the middle of the test, I actually said I have to go to the bathroom, and the teacher let me.  And the notes were still there?  All nice, set up.  Why'd you put them in the bathroom?  Why not just go to your locker?  Because I said I was going to the bathroom in case she checked.  She could see me going into the fucking bathroom.  He's a cheater, not a liar.  Yeah, really.  Why don't you just lie him?  Huh?  Why don't you just put them in your pocket and then go to the bathroom?  I study, but then it's like, wait a minute.  I can actually have notes during the test.  Yeah.  You did that? 
[02:54:00]  No, I never did the bathroom thing.  And I'm like, there's no way this bathroom thing is going to work.  She's got to shut down the bathroom privilege during the test.  She goes, all right.  And I went in there.  I'm like, holy fuck.  Well, she probably didn't think anybody was.  Looked up four or five answers quick.  She probably didn't think anybody was setting up notes in the bathroom like a fucking gun  in The Godfather.  We could tape the notes.  It's an old fashioned toilet.  Tape the notes behind it.  Yeah, I hit them.  I don't remember exactly how I hit them anymore.  They can't do that anymore, though.  Like, all these kids have phones and like.  Yeah, but you can just go on Wikipedia on your phone.  No, but the teacher's whole job is to watch it as you take the test. 
[02:54:30]  Who's going to be able to pull out a phone?  There was one kid.  I mean, go to the bathroom during a test.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  One kid ripped out a page in his textbook and he just put it on his desk.  He got caught.  Of course he did.  There was.  I once.  There was nothing more nerve wracking when you decide to go down that road.  And sometimes I would hide like a little cheat sheet under the under the paper, under  the test.  Just fucking freaking out that that I'm going to get caught.  I used to take.  And then trying to take that peek when I thought the coast was clear and trying not to 
[02:55:00]  crinkle any paper or anything, all that shit.  And then trying to get rid of the cheat sheet before you hand in the test because that's  trying to get that back in your pocket, slide it back in.  I used to take Latin and every test I would have to spit on my hands and just rub and rub  and rub before I handed the test back in.  I always had smeared black ink all over my hands because I wrote everything all over my  hands.  I didn't feel guilty, like cheating on shit that I knew I didn't give a fuck about and  never have to know again. 
[02:55:30]  I never, that never bothered me.  Yeah.  The classes I took that I'm like, you know, this means something, I think, or will someday.  Then I'd try to focus on that.  I wrote formulas for triangles on the inside of my calculators.  All that shit.  I'm not memorizing fucking formulas.  No.  Because they're a bunch of cheats.  One time I cheated off a girl's test, like her entire test.  Right.  And then I got caught at the very end.  And I told, I wasn't going to, I told the teacher she didn't know I was doing it. 
[02:56:00]  And then I said, it's just, you know, I haven't been doing well.  And I got nervous.  So I looked at her paper for the extra credit questions.  Really?  And the teacher said, well, you know, I can't give you credit for the extra credit.  And I said, I understand that.  And she was like, luckily you still got an 89.  I was like, great.  Teachers are so gullible.  Not one of those answers was mine.  I figured they knew we were all cheating.  They knew it was bullshit too.  They just didn't want to deal with it.  Well, they knew it was bullshit too.  Yeah.  Teachers are smart.  They know they're teaching shit that means nothing. 
[02:56:30]  Obama sang again.  Do you like Obama singing, Jimmy?  It's irrelevant to me.  I don't care if he sings it.  I don't care if he fucking sings or hums or breakdances or fucking does the Watusi.  How about instead of singing, we make sure that gas doesn't go up to $5?  Yeah, exactly.  I think we're pushing four bucks already in New York.  Yeah.  Four bucks.  4.13 I saw.  Yeah.  How about you worry about that?  It was good last time when he sang, though.  Nice voice.  This time he sang with a little Mick Jagger helping him out at B.B. King's? 
[02:57:00]  No, it was in New York?  No, no, no.  B.B. King and Mick Jagger were both there.  Where?  It was some event for him.  I don't know exactly what it was.  In New York?  I'm not sure that it was in New York.  By the way, Tim...  We know when he's here, so I don't know if he was here.  Yeah, I don't think it was.  No, it must have been Chicago.  I was going to say, yeah, because we know the song he sang.  Yeah.  What?  No deuces who has been blocked.  Jim Norton, you're a champion of free speech, but you're too fat and lazy to comment on  chink when it happened.  Keep up, queer.  I've been talking about this every day since it happened.  Yeah.  So I sent him a private message and called him a scumbag and blocked him. 
[02:57:30]  Wow.  But it's like, I've been talking about this every day.  Yeah.  We were on top of this from day one.  I just wanted to say that.  It felt really good to block him.  You couldn't ignore it.  It only happened two days ago.  What day is this?  It's Wednesday.  It happened over the weekend.  It was one of the first stories we talked about when we came back on radio.  So here's Obama singing.  Thank you.  God bless y'all.  We were trying to get you to have him sing that.  Yeah.  Because I heard you. 
[02:58:00]  Come on.  I heard you sing it out green.  So you're starting something.  You got to keep it up now.  You can do it.  You got to keep it up now. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, Chicago.  Is that all he sang?  Yeah.  He didn't fight it on the words.  It wasn't good either.  No.  See, I never only liked that because he's president.  Chips is obvious things.  Yeah.  It's like, no shit.  It's not even anything to be outraged by.  Yeah.  He like pointed the microphone to someone else for the words that he didn't know. 
[02:59:00]  BB King.  That was BB.  I didn't see the video.  Yeah.  He didn't sing very well this time either.  Right.  I found one guy that thought it was gray as well.  Just one, though.  Fuck.  Exactly.  One lousy fucking guy.  Most people know it's grain.  Everyone knows it's grain.  No.  Including that guy.  He just wants you to like him.  I still think it's gray.  Well, I mean, you don't see the, like, grain fields blowing in the wind.  I also saw the sky.  No.  They loved writing songs about the sky when it was getting ugly out there. 
[02:59:30]  Just because bombs bursting in air.  And Amber's a color already.  There you go.  And what?  Amber is a color already.  Yeah.  How could they be?  How could the gray?  How could it be a yellow gray?  Because the sun was going down and there's fucking smoke all over the place because we're  bombing the shit out of the Brits.  But the waves themselves are both amber and gray?  Yes.  No, I don't think that makes any sense.  You haven't seen a sunset, idiot.  I've checked your Twitter a couple times.  That sun spreads out at the end of the day.  So you got the spreading sun and then you got the fucking, you know, gray clouds. 
[03:00:00]  But they're not clouds because they're there from the smoke.  Have you seen grain fields before?  No.  You should check them out.  I'm from the East Coast.  This song will make a whole lot more sense to you.  Why?  Because you'll see, oh, I see.  And when the wind blows them, it looks like waves.  What's the amber part?  That's the color of the grain.  I thought the grain was gray.  No.  No.  Gray is the word that you just kind of inserted in there.  Oh.  I see.  You understand.  Yeah, I do, I guess.  Amber waves made of? 
[03:00:30]  Of gray.  No.  Grain.  Gray.  Jimmy, are we selling tickets soon?  Yeah.  And I got to go do a phoner.  Oh, yeah.  We got to get out of here.  Tomorrow, Friday, Saturday, I will be in Fort Lauderdale at the Improv, if anyone has any  desire to come.  And I will tweet later, go to playhousesquare.org tomorrow morning from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.  Kenny sent me a link, but it's 50 things long for pre-sale tickets, so I want to be able 
[03:01:00]  to just give it to you verbally tomorrow.  The password is WMMS, because that is the station in Cleveland that is promoting my show.  Right.  And my one-hour special tapes, April 28th at the Ohio Theater, I almost lost the deal  waiting for this theater, because the theater wasn't available, and I'm shooting two weeks  later than contractually I'm supposed to shoot.  So I really did fight very, very hard to get the show into Cleveland, because the theater  wasn't available the 15th, I think, which is when I had to shoot contractually by. 
[03:01:30]  Right.  So they bent.  Epics and Comedy Central are both very, very amenable to work with me on this, so  I'm finally doing something in Cleveland again, and I'm very, very psyched about it.  And we will be broadcasting Friday afternoon.  Are we doing morning or afternoon?  I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  Okay.  Maybe they're leaning towards afternoon.  I'd rather do an afternoon broadcast.  Yeah, let's do afternoons.  Let's go old school.  Fucking sleep late, have some people come down.  I would love that.  Yeah, that'd be great.  Very cool.  All right.  One more call, because you might have to clear something up there, Jimmy.  Sure.  Scott in Wisconsin. 
[03:02:00]  Scott.  Hey, Jim.  Yes, sir.  I thought yesterday you were saying that you thought the guy should be fired, right?  I thought the difference is the guy who put the headline up, I thought, knew what he was  doing, and I firmly believe said that to be cute.  But now, isn't that the same as like a comedian going kind of edgy with like, you know, nappy  headed hole or, you know what I mean?  Pushing that limit?  No, we have. 
[03:02:30]  Their job?  No, we have different jobs.  And the reason I'm saying that is no comedian would go on The Tonight Show and say chink.  Like, you know you can't do that.  And with a comic, we live in a different world where they make their living doing puns.  Like, he knows what he's doing.  That's why I don't think the announcer should be fired either, because I really believe the  announcer just kind of spit it out, and it must be lurking in there somewhere.  But I didn't have any problem with them firing him for that, because I didn't believe  that he didn't recognize it. 
[03:03:00]  But it's not like he called him straight out a gook or something like that.  No, you know what I mean?  That's exactly it.  You're right.  He didn't.  That's exactly it.  He didn't.  And that was the argument he thought he would not get in trouble.  He thought he could say, hey, I didn't come out and say gook, but we all know what  happened.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know.  I just don't think it's everyone being too freaking sensitive over a word, you know,  a pun.  Do you think, let me ask you, like, Opie raised a good example before, but a black hockey  player, or someone raised it.  Do you think if the hockey player had been black, like, let's say it was one of the,  and everyone was talking about it, and say he finally missed that goal, and the headline 
[03:03:30]  read, the jig is up.  People, or if they said, say his name was Johnson, Johnson gets spooked.  You would say that there's a million ways to phrase that.  That's not one that's so common that you would use it without thinking.  No, that's fair.  But do you still think it's people just being too freaking sensitive?  Part of it is...  A lot of people that are scared. 
[03:04:00]  But when you say chink...  On special interest groups.  They are scared.  But when you say chink in a sports headline, and we all know what you're doing, that's  really hard to defend.  It's really hard to defend that.  But isn't it the same kind of, like, the nappy-headed hoe part?  No, because nappy-headed hoe was done on a comedy show by a guy who was doing it to  be funny, and nappy-headed hoe is something that black people say.  Black people say hoe all the time.  Chinese people don't refer to each other as chinks. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, I suppose.  All right, man.  Have a good day.  And there's a difference between saying hoe and whore.  Yeah, and it's also, there's a difference between saying nappy-headed hoe, which is  technically not a racial stereotype.  Nappy-headed hoe is something blacks would say a lot more than whites.  Right.  But that is technically...  You know, Sam is nappy-headed.  Yes, I am.  Chink in the armor, we know what you're doing.  And if I'm being inconsistent, look, I'm sorry.  I'm not trying to be.  I think if Chink in the armor has been used a lot, then none of these guys should have 
[03:05:00]  been fired.  They should have been suspended.  You know?  I think people, yeah, certainly were trying to get away with something, but if it's a  term that is used a lot, then look, I don't know.  Suspend them, calm everyone down, and maybe if you have to tell them, look, just don't  go there.  You know?  Yeah.  Just don't go there.  It's too sensitive, but...  Someone had a thing about the grain-gray thing. 
[03:05:30]  I guess the next line is plain, and gray doesn't rhyme with plain.  Right.  That would be a...  Yeah, but when I was rhyming, I didn't have to make it perfect.  You could take poetic license, not everything.  That's what I did.  That's what I did with the gray and the plain.  It was close enough for me.  For Purple Mountain's majesty above the fruited plain.  Maybe it's play.  No, I knew that part.  You weren't sure about that.  Yeah.  But I thought they were talking about planes in the sky. 
[03:06:00]  Fruited?  Yeah, I thought the plane was going over the mountainside.  With fruit on it?  Yeah, why not?  You ignore some of the words in the song.  I'm fucking with you now.  I don't believe you.  I knew plain was plain.  That I knew.  I think...  But the grain and the gray thing.  Airplane in the yellow-gray sky.  There were no planes when the song was written.  Of course it wasn't a plane, plane.  We're going to go home now.  Hear a lot.  Ooh, another guy.  Dick Wiggler. 
[03:06:30]  Me and Dick Wiggler on the same page.  He thought it was gray as well.  Did he ever stop to analyze the lyrics of the song and think...  I didn't have time to do that shit.  Why?  Are you watching sports?  Nah, too busy cleaning up my room.  Oh.  You know, because it got destroyed a lot.  Why would you analyze fucking patriotic songs?  I gotta figure out what's going on, you know?  Gotta figure out what's being said.  What am I singing here?  I don't know.  I got a little something in the show.  Remember Mr. Ross?  Bob Ross? 
[03:07:00]  Oh, I thought you meant Danny.  Danny Ross, sure.  It's related to Bob Ross, a little known fact.  It's his dad?  Yep.  Who has passed.  He was the painter on TV.  Sorry to hear that.  And he had a very, very, very naughty, naughty mind.  He did?  Oh, yeah.  He was very dirty when he was making those paintings.  He was the one with the big afro.  With the trees?  With the trees, right.  And the bushes.  But like those types of bushes?  Well, why don't you take a listen and you decide.  All right.  There you go.  What do you want now? 
[03:07:30]  Look, you're the one who stuck around.  I assumed you're the one who wanted to talk.  I was just chilling.  I bet you were.  Just chilling out.  Getting my coat on.  You like doing the show solo?  I mean, obviously, I like doing it with amp, but.  I'm embarrassed that I really thought it was gray and not grain.  People like you're making a joke, right?  You're joking about this.  Yeah.  I mean, I think that that's worse than me not knowing about sports.  The fact that you don't know the lyrics to Star Spangled Banner or whatever.  Why?  I used to hate those songs.  They were so hokey and stupid. 
[03:08:00]  It's America.  You think it's more American to get excited about the miracle hockey game  than it is to think that, you think that game is more American than the Star Spangled Banner?  Hell fucking yes.  Sam, it's sung to a Latino guy.  Jose, can you see?  I can't be part of this.  That was Club Soda Kenny.  I wouldn't, I mean.  On Facebook?  I wouldn't recommend either.  Club Soda Kenny spent the day walking around from person to person here at SiriusXM  and claiming that I, Sam Roberts, had instigated the Chris Brown CM Punk Twitter war. 
[03:08:30]  At least you're finally admitting it.  No, I'm not.  Fuck, congratulations.  That's a cool thing to fucking have under your belt.  You're going to get hired by WWE yet.  Well, if that were the case, I would take credit for it.  But what I'm saying is...  How are you doing, Eric?  I'm doing great.  Every day, he's got another lie about me to tell people.  Like, yesterday, he was going around Club Soda Kennywood.  Why lie when the facts are way more interesting with you? 
[03:09:00]  That's what I think.  He's got some weird shit going on, and why make up shit?  I don't know.  He could go...  Because he doesn't listen to the show.  So instead of going and telling people one of the weird things that I said about myself today,  he makes something up.  Like yesterday, he was going around telling everybody over the weekend,  I was on Facebook jerking off.  And the only...  His little kernel of truth in that was that I was on Facebook over the weekend,  and Kenny saw me on the little, you know, texting, Facebook text thing. 
[03:09:30]  Right.  And he messaged me and said,  Hey, why are you jerking off right now?  And I responded, I'm not doing that.  And that was the end of the conversation.  The next day, we get back to work, and every person that walks by, Kenny goes,  Hey, you know what Sam was doing on Facebook yesterday?  Jerking off.  But why would you jerk off on Facebook?  I don't.  Now, him and his fiancée are very kinky, I'm finding out.  And you jerk off on Facebook. 
[03:10:00]  I don't jerk off on it.  People can watch or...  No.  They watch porn together?  That's another thing that Kenny made up.  I didn't say that.  Are you a cam girl?  I'm a cam whore.  Are you?  No.  I'm not a cam whore.  You're a cam girl?  No.  I don't have a...  That's fucking weird.  Actually, I do have a webcam.  No, I don't jerk off on Facebook.  This is things that Kenny makes up.  He's doing this to promote his podcasts.  Oh, this is your angle?  You jerk off on Facebook and then it leads to people checking out your podcast? 
[03:10:30]  I didn't mention my podcast.  But that's smart that you're jerking off on Facebook.  I mean, I have a podcast, right?  Knowing that will get people to your podcast.  Well, that's not how I promote it.  Brilliant, Sam.  Fucking brilliant.  Yeah.  Fucking dick dribbler.  You're trying.  You're searching for something.  Don't shake my hand.  Who, me?  I wasn't going to.  Because you've got jizz on it.  Well, you don't deserve a handshake.  There's nothing about you that I would want to shake your hand right now.  Could you entertain us on the way home? 
[03:11:00]  I don't...  No promises. </pre>
