<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show covered a wide range of topics throughout its broadcast.  The show opened with a discussion of Christopher Nolan's *The Dark Knight Rises*, focusing heavily on the difficulty in understanding Tom Hardy's Bane character, debate on whether different actors played Batman due to apparent inconsistencies in the chin structure and Bale's mole, and commentary on Anne Hathaway's Catwoman.  This led into a discussion of Rush Limbaugh's comparison of Bane to Mitt Romney and Bain Capital.  A call from Rich Voss about a previous interaction with Glenn Beck segued into a discussion of healthcare, politics, and anti-semitism.  A heated argument between Opie and a crew member briefly interrupted the flow.  The hosts also mentioned upcoming appearances by Gary Oldman and reviewed Colin Quinn's recent performance.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of New York City real estate, specifically the luxury apartment boom in Williamsburg and projections for Long Island City and Bushwick. This was followed by jokes about the subway and disappointment over Jeremy Lin's departure from the New York Knicks to the Houston Rockets, including discussion of the financial impact on the Knicks and the fluctuation in the parent company's value during and after “Linsanity.”  The conversation returned briefly to the Bane/Romney comparison, deemed silly by the hosts, before shifting to a discussion of the US government and a Colin Quinn stand-up routine.  A substantial portion of the show was devoted to listener calls detailing negative experiences with the Boy Scouts of America, including numerous allegations of sexual abuse and inappropriate behavior, described using graphic and sexually explicit terms.  Further guest appearances by Gary Oldman and Mick Foley were mentioned.  The hosts also expressed gratitude to Gene Simmons for his support of a memorial fund for a deceased radio producer.


A significant portion of the show focused on one host, Roland, falling asleep during a *Dark Knight Rises* screening, punctuated by mumbled "no spoilers," and his subsequent confused recollection of the film. The hosts extensively brainstormed outrageous stunts for their upcoming Chicago show, including a pig race with overweight women, a "worst breath" contest, an "oddest thing" contest, and a "Chip" impersonation contest.  A phone call with Dr. Steve detailed inappropriate sexual encounters from his childhood at summer camp and with a male babysitter.  The show briefly touched upon the Jerry Sandusky scandal and the Joe Paterno statue controversy, and a phone interview with Gary Oldman regarding the IMAX filming techniques in *The Dark Knight Rises* was mentioned. The show also included repeated, seemingly nonsensical chants of "Mimi Beardsley." Gary Oldman joined the show later in this segment.


Gary Oldman joined the show and discussed his role in *The Dark Knight Rises*, his experiences working with different directors (Kubrick and Nolan), his insecurities about watching his own performances, and his memorable role in *Hannibal*.  He also briefly mentioned a recent audition for Luc Besson. Later, Mick Foley and his son Hugh joined the broadcast.  The conversation shifted to Foley's upcoming appearances on Raw's 1000th episode and comedy shows, his comedy style, his son's critique of it, his campaigning for Barack Obama, and his varied fan interactions, noting differences based on race. A London comedian, also a guest, discussed differences between American and British comedy.  The group also discussed a new portable gaming unit, the Montreal Comedy Festival, and potential collaborations.  The conversation was frequently punctuated by profanity and crude humor, and numerous unplanned tangents.

Finally, a segment featuring comedian Sam Burns, along with Mick Foley and Brendan Burns, explored the similarities between stand-up comedy and professional wrestling, emphasizing audience interaction, stage presence, and material development.  They shared anecdotes from performing in different venues, particularly in the UK and Ireland, highlighting differences in audience reactions and heckling.  Specific mentions included Amy Schumer, Louis C.K., and Kurt Angle.  The guests discussed the challenges of stand-up, including hecklers and the pressure to be funny.  The segment frequently drew analogies between comedy and wrestling, with numerous F-bombs and sexually explicit references. Sam Burns promoted his upcoming special, and the segment concluded with mentions of upcoming shows for Mick Foley and Brendan Burns and the fundraiser for the deceased executive producer.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning everybody.  Good.  Of the morn.  There, there, there, there, there, there.  How do we wake the fuck up?  There we go.  I went to Batman last night. I know you guys went during the day.  Yes, we did.  I went to the 8 o'clock showing.  Uh, the special preview at the IMAX. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  And.  Didn't get home till, uh, 11 o'clock.  This is a long movie.  That is a long movie.  I believe someone timed it at 2 hours and 40 minutes.  That's a long movie, ladies and gentlemen.  And then you, you stick the previews on the, on the front of that.  And you stick those commercials before the previews.  You're going to be sitting in a movie theater for over 3 hours to see, uh, Dark Knight.  Yeah, because, uh, we saw the, the, uh, preview. 
[00:01:00]  And, um, there's no, um, there's no trailers before it.  No.  The movie starts, that's it.  But if you're going into the theater and then you got, first you got that, you know, sit and wait looking at a blank screen for a while.  You got the dumb real estate ad and you got a couple, uh, trivia questions.  Right.  And then all the previews.  And all the previews.  Then the movie.  Oh my God, you're going to be there for a long time.  Was it crowded when you saw, with us, it was a half full theater, but let's give it a preview.  Half full, really?  Oh, really?  I figured it'd be crowded. 
[00:01:30]  Uh, 8 o'clock was, just about every seat was taken, yeah.  Yeah.  I was next to a very old lady that really, really enjoyed herself.  Yeah.  Uh, you know, I liked it, I guess.  She liked it?  I liked it, I guess.  Alfred's wife.  Was it Alfred's wife?  I wish we could talk about this movie.  Boo, boo, Alfred.  Yeah.  Boo.  We got crying, Alfred.  Well, I don't understand why I was making such a fuss about this whole thing. 
[00:02:00]  I don't say, what the fuck am I even saying?  Yeah, thank you.  I'm going to say this.  Yeah.  Make sure you, uh, you, you clean out your ears really well before you see The Dark Knight.  Yeah.  Because I didn't really understand what the fuck Bane was saying half the movie.  Well, saying things like, why are you even going to come back to the dark night?  Wait, what did he say? 
[00:02:30]  How do you make a massive blockbuster, and then someone is in a little studio somewhere  going, yeah, I think everyone's going to be able to understand him?  This is what I heard, really.  It was very hard to understand.  It was, right?  I wasn't the only one?  At certain times, I'm like, wait, I think that was important, and I don't know what the  fuck he just said.  He's talking key plot lines.  Key plot lines.  And I'm like, I don't even understand what he's saying.  And then I'm thinking, because we've been doing radio for so long, our ears shot, and other 
[00:03:00]  people did understand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  People of Gotham City.  Oh, you know, let's see what I can imagine when I come back.  What?  Wait, what did he say?  I, overall, I like the movie, but, yeah, but.  Judge, jury, and executioner.  What?  You heard me.  No, I didn't. 
[00:03:30]  Trebek, your mother's a whore.  Like I had sex with your mother, Trebek.  That was the best call.  I couldn't figure out who Bane sounded like.  I thought David Attenborough, the nature guy.  Yeah, he did sound like David Attenborough.  David Attenborough picked out fucking Daryl Hammond's impression as Sean Connery on the  Jeopardy bit from SNL.  That was a good call.  I can't stress enough how funny this is going to be to people in a week, because no one has  seen the movie yet.  You guys are going to, all you're going to think is that impression. 
[00:04:00]  Just picture him hanging from a tree going, there are beautiful honeybees.  They're going to sting me if I get too close.  And once again, me.  What?  What?  What did he say?  It was one mumbling fucking mess for me.  God!  It was hard to understand Bane.  It was.  I thought most of it, but there were parts, and I have good hearing, that I could not understand  what he was saying.  Subtitles, please, please. 
[00:04:30]  I'm telling Hollywood, it's not too late.  You need subtitles for Bane, I'm telling you right now.  That's going to be a huge complaint.  When does this movie hit?  Oh, they're going for Friday?  Friday.  The day after your birthday?  Yeah.  Is it your real birthday coming up?  Yeah, I actually forgot until somebody reminded me of it.  Wait, is it your real birthday?  It's tomorrow.  Yeah.  Tomorrow's your birthday?  Yeah.  So why don't we do something?  Yeah.  You should take the day off.  We take the day off.  I totally forgot.  Take the day off.  No, I can't.  We take our birthdays off now. 
[00:05:00]  I don't think it's too late.  Get the subtitles immediately, please.  Very difficult to, also, you brought this up.  You don't see a person's mouth.  It takes you out of the person's acting a bit, doesn't it?  I think so.  You can't really relate to the person.  You start seeing the eyes just kind of moving, so you need an actor that really knows how  to use his eyes.  Yeah.  Because, yeah, you don't see his mouth at all, babe.  Yeah, look, my eyes are dropping back and forth, and I'm trying to act with my eyes. 
[00:05:30]  Did anyone else notice, too, and maybe, I'm probably a hack when it comes to these type  of movies, they use a different, they use a different guy when he's dressed as Batman.  That's a chiseled chin and lips.  No, that's the same guy.  I'm going to bet money it's not.  Because his, his, he almost has, like, a speech thing going on.  Yeah, a lisp almost.  He does, yeah, yeah, he does have some kind of thing going on.  Who, uh, Christian Bale? 
[00:06:00]  Christian Bale.  It's definitely him.  Boy, you're one of the people that would be fooled by his, the costume.  You'd be like, hey, hey, Batman, have you seen Bruce Wayne?  And he'd be like, no, no, I don't know where he is.  I don't know where, well, Bruce, I'm wrong over, but let me tell you something,  I don't know where he is.  I don't know where he is.  I don't know where he is.  He was, he was saying, I was getting permission to Gordon.  And I was, I don't know where he is.  I think they listened to Jimmy, because they toned that shit down a little bit. 
[00:06:30]  They toned the Batman thing down a little bit.  Just a little bit.  You're very bad for Gotham.  We know, we get it.  Ah, ha, ha.  What's the matter, Albert?  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  What is the old man crying again?  As we were walking out of the theater, Jimmy just goes, ah, stupid, weepy Alfred.  God, you know what, people, we're going to have to re-air this.  We're going to have to re-air this segment in a week after everyone sees Batman, because  then people will howl. 
[00:07:00]  They'll howl.  I'm thinking it's a...  There's no spoilers.  There's no spoilers.  What fucking spoilers are we giving, you dumb cock?  What?  Shut up.  We're helping you out.  You might have a tough time understanding veins.  You're going to want to focus a little more.  That's all.  And I...  Alfred crying is a fucking...  Yeah, he's a weepy old man.  And I think it's a different guy in the Batman suit.  I don't think that's true.  Look at the chiseled chin.  I think they had...  Mr. Bell has that.  And the costume, his mask kind of pushes his mouth a little.  Makes like a chiseled chin. 
[00:07:30]  I think they had...  Rich Voss wants to talk about Glenn Beck.  How about Rich Voss calls back in a little bit?  We're in the middle of our Batman thing.  Call back in a little bit, Rich.  Ah, is that a big movie?  Yeah.  Is that the one from the TV show?  Why are you talking like that?  I can't understand you.  That's just how I talk.  You don't know anything about him, Carol.  You're so stupid.  Bane, first of all, let me tell you something.  Todd, Todd, what the hell did he do? 
[00:08:00]  He's like a superhero villain.  Not no one can understand.  It's Marshmallow.  If dummies like this are in Gotham, I should just let them all die.  Nobody understands what you're saying.  Rich did tweet.  Yeah, it's Marshmallow.  Rich did tweet the wrong Glenn Beck last night, by the way.  Oh, it's hilarious.  He got a Glenn Beck that had like fucking...  He did.  That had like 20 followers.  You know, there are times you want to tweet somebody, and you're pissed, and you're looking. 
[00:08:30]  You have to see how many followers.  You've got to assume the real Glenn Beck has more than 20 followers, you idiot.  You've got to.  Anyway, I'm going with the, it's a different guy in the Batman suit.  No, I have got to say.  I'm going with it.  I think it's pal.  No.  His lips and his chin aren't like that.  No, his lips were exactly the same as he, he had the same little lispy thing going on.  I swear.  No, it also took me out of the movie, and it was such a subtle thing, but I want to say 
[00:09:00]  this, because I think it'll get in people's heads, and it'll bother them.  Christian Bale has a horrendous, horrendous mole between...  Oh, he does.  Between his nose and his right eye, that'll drive you nuts, now that I'm pointing it out.  He's had that forever.  But I think it's growing.  Is it?  As he gets older.  As he gets older.  He has to get rid of that.  It looks like there was, I thought Robin was on his face.  I'm like, what is that?  How does he see?  You saw that? 
[00:09:30]  Yes.  It's pretty big.  I thought it was a movie prop.  It's pretty much a marble.  It's fucking terrible.  And then, I saw that because it's in the opening scene, basically, or the first few minutes  of the movie.  And then I noticed that, I guess you had to have a lot of moles to be in this movie in general.  That woman with the one right on her head.  She had one right on her head.  He had his over here between his nose and his eye.  I couldn't stop looking.  And then you have fucking Morgan Freeman.  Morgan Freeman.  Very moly.  He's a moly mess.  And then Anne Hathaway, she's got all sorts of shit when she's, you know, when she has 
[00:10:00]  her arms exposed.  She's beautiful, though.  She did look great in that fucking Catwoman outfit.  She was sexy.  Holy shit.  She's riding the Batcycle there.  And her ass is perched up on it.  Is that a spoiler?  No.  No.  No.  It's in the trailer.  I don't know.  That one's in the trailer where she's fucking riding around in a little Batcycle.  She is sexy in this movie.  Yeah.  She is fucking sexy.  There's the mole right there.  It's a mole slash boil.  It's a burry.  It's got one of those burries. 
[00:10:30]  That Batcycle was pretty cool when it went.  And then Morgan Freeman was good.  What do you mean he was good?  Morgan Freeman.  He played Morgan Freeman again.  I don't think the guy's ever...  Mr. Wayne, I'll fix it.  I'll fix it.  Alfred, why are you crying, Alfred?  Boy, there's this old Batwoman.  He's going all over the place. 
[00:11:00]  Mr. Wayne.  Why?  That's right.  I'm just kidding.  Why?  He messed away.  They're all British, though.  Like, fucking Christian Bale is British.  Oh, of course, Michael Caine.  Who else is British?  Gary Oldman.  Talking with the American accent.  Gary Oldman.  And Gary Oldman will be in the studio today.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's going to do tremendous numbers.  Of course it will.  Of course it will. 
[00:11:30]  I was just frustrated that I couldn't understand Bing.  And I'm glad I wasn't the only one.  By the way, huge four-star reviews in both of the New York papers?  Actually, I'm not glad I'm the only one.  Because I was hoping it was just me.  Because that, I don't know.  I think people are going to be, I think that's going to be a complaint.  You got Bane's voice, by the way?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's from the trailer.  So shut the fuck up, people.  Jesus.  Yeah.  When Gotham is ashes, you have my permission to die. 
[00:12:00]  You understood them there.  That's it?  When Gotham is ashes, you have my permission to die.  You totally understand them.  But it seems like maybe they redid the voice for the trailer.  Because I don't remember it sounding that clear.  Yeah, that doesn't sound like that.  Well, thank you.  E-Rock is saying, they did something there.  That is a different fucking voice.  Unless it's the IMAX speakers.  Maybe the IMAX, I'm wondering if this, because the IMAX speakers are so powerful.  Right.  And so surrounding you, I wonder if there's something with all of that sound that's fucking 
[00:12:30]  bouncing it off.  Maybe.  It's probably easy to hear on a smaller speaker.  In a regular movie theater, you might hear that better.  I heard that.  A lot of bottom end, a lot of bass.  I heard that clearly, but...  E-Rock, you're saying that's a different voice or a different version of his voice?  It doesn't sound like it has that effect on it, like it does in the movie.  There's been an internet thing about his voice for a little while.  Oh, yeah?  It has.  Yeah, I think it's going to...  What are they saying?  It has.  Just that nobody can understand what he's saying.  I couldn't understand half the fucking words.  I was so...  I was starting to get frustrated. 
[00:13:00]  Yes.  And then I gave up on the plot.  I'm like, all right, there's something on here.  Fuck.  Yes.  Something like this and that.  There you go.  Ah, the loons.  I was looking for the loons.  The Spartan Owl!  The Spartan Owl is extinct!  I was lost.  I was lost in the woods.  I had to look for the loons.  Master Wayne! 
[00:13:30]  Stop your sons and crying, you fucking faggot.  Oh, Master Wayne!  Jesus Christ, pissy eyes.  Son of a bitch.  Batman sounded like Clint Eastwood.  Yeah, he was.  He sounded a bit Clint Eastwood-y.  And then, you know, this is starting to drive me nuts in movies as well.  They use New York City a lot, and I guess New York City is Gotham, but to me it was New  York City because it's the same flyovers you see in every movie. 
[00:14:00]  At least Spider-Man, they built a building that doesn't exist, that kind of throws you...  But I think Spider-Man's supposed to be New York, right?  Yeah, Spider-Man's in New York.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's supposed to be New York, but they built a whole different, you know, new building  for the movie.  Yeah, there's that big fucking, you know, building that they built in Spider-Man.  So New York City wasn't supposed to be Gotham City, even though it looked exactly like Gotham  City.  Yeah, Gotham City is Gotham City.  It's New York, but...  They could paint some shit in there to, you know, change it up a little bit.  Yeah, they changed a few things. 
[00:14:30]  I'm like, that's not the Gotham Bridge, that's the 59th Street Bridge.  Like, I looked, I actually went over the 59th Street Bridge last night, and I looked over  to the left as I was going eastbound, and it was all like water in the movie, if you  know what I mean.  And there's a lot of shit there.  It's like the Bronx.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, if you look, it's like, I don't see a big bay.  Oh, so they erased that shit?  Gotham Bay, I think they say.  Yeah, that was all gone.  Yeah, they flipped it.  The north part of the city goes out to the water instead of the south part. 
[00:15:00]  Exactly.  And there's four bridges on the Hudson.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's...  How did you know that was the Hudson, not the East River?  Oh, that...  Because you could see where the Freedom Tower was.  Wait, it was supposed to be the East River.  No, there was bridges on the East River side, but then there was four bridges on the Hudson  side, too.  Yep.  Why are you fucking good talking to me?  Who are you?  So they painted that shit in.  All right.  But to me, it still looked very New Yorkish, but whatever.  I agree.  E-Rock, what did you think of the movie?  You're more of a cartoony fucking comic book guy than most of us. 
[00:15:30]  I think people will like it because it's not cartoony.  It's not...  It's extremely dark.  It doesn't come off as...  Like, Batman can't do anything...  Like, he's not totally indestructible.  Like, he can't do anything right.  It takes him forever to get something going.  Get something done.  Yeah.  Yeah, there were certain elements I did like of it.  Like, a lot, actually.  I was just frustrated because it was hard to understand Bane.  I mean, that, to me, was the frustrating point in the movie. 
[00:16:00]  So kind of everything from the movie from there was like, God damn it, I can't understand...  Because Ledger was so fucking awesome as the Joker.  Like, he was just...  He was a fucking...  A trilogy stealer, as they say.  Yep.  And I think that they wanted to do him in this movie.  There's no way you couldn't want him in the third one after that performance.  And then he dies, and you have to start from scratch and be right.  Yeah.  But, um...  That was frustrating for me.  But Christian Bale's acting was fucking phenomenal. 
[00:16:30]  I mean, he was great as, uh...  Yeah.  That would never happen.  No, of course not.  Yeah, all right.  But, I mean...  I can't wait to talk about this movie in a week or so.  You have to suspend certain disbelief because it's a comic book.  Like, there's certain...  They would never allow that to be a thing.  You do have to think, like, it is a comic book.  It is a comic book.  So, there's certain comic book things they have to be true to.  Like, even in the Joker version, there's a couple of lines he said that I was like,  eh, that wasn't a great line.  They could have rewritten that as better.  But I'm like, I'm a fucking 40-year-old guy. 
[00:17:00]  Comic book-y.  That's a comic book-y line.  Yeah.  Like, okay.  It is a comic book, yeah.  I was able to grasp that whole thing.  Yeah, there were some scenes and stuff and storylines.  Is that what happened in real life?  Oh, yeah, it is a comic book.  Yeah.  It's a comic book.  Just ignore all the moles in this movie and you might be all right.  There are a lot of moles.  Yes.  Why don't you cover that shit up?  Someone's very moly.  Moly.  All right, Trebek.  I was having sex with your mother. 
[00:17:30]  That will...  By the way, that will ruin it for...  Somebody will not think of only that.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, just ignore that.  I will say...  Bane sounds like that.  Bane's opening line, I'm not going to say what it is, but when he first talks, I thought  it was great.  Like, there was a couple of really cool scenes.  I don't remember that one.  I don't remember.  Oh, the opening scene's fucking great.  There's some great scenes as well.  I really did like that fucking... 
[00:18:00]  You forget about the opening scene because it was so long.  It was three hours ago, if you're at the end of the movie.  That is fucking cool, man.  That opening scene was amazing.  And in IMAX.  I forgot all about that.  Remember that?  Because right...  That got me going like, holy fuck.  Holy shit, right.  This is an action movie.  Very cool.  How the fuck do you film that?  It was amazing.  That's all I was thinking.  I was like, how the fuck do you film that?  It looked fucking great.  Yeah, that was fucking cool as shit.  It was really cool.  The opening 20 minutes is pretty fucking amazing. 
[00:18:30]  No time for fear.  Yeah, that was a great opening scene.  There's a couple of moments where I was looking down like, ah.  I got fucking sweaty palms.  Yeah, you do get that idea.  With the IMAX, it's so huge.  With the IMAX, they go from kind of almost a letterbox thing, because the screen is square.  But it's fucking huge square.  And then they go letterbox when they're doing the acting stuff.  And then the action scenes, it goes up to that full fucking screen.  I didn't notice that. 
[00:19:00]  I didn't notice that either.  It does.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  It kept moving it?  It goes letterbox during the regular scenes.  Yeah, yeah.  And then the huge, giant action sequences, it goes full fucking square.  I didn't notice that.  I didn't notice that either.  Wow.  A lot of the scenes were in the mansion.  It cuts down like that.  It goes letterbox.  I didn't notice that.  But when they go back to the city, it went, I can't believe I didn't notice that.  Wow.  Oh, really?  No, I didn't notice that at all.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Badass.  That's about it, I guess.  Yeah, that's our Batman break.  Hey, Batman, what are you, playing baseball or something? 
[00:19:30]  Uh-oh, who's that?  Chipper Bane.  Chipper Bane?  Chipper Bane.  Chipper Bane.  Chipper, don't be such a Bane in my bottom, my mother would say.  Oh, no, we're not done with Batman.  Oh, what do you got?  Your boy Rush Limbaugh.  Limbaugh.  Rush.  What has he got to say about Batman?  Well, he compares Batman.  Oh, no.  He compares Batman's Bane to Bane Capital and Mitt Romney. 
[00:20:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  Oh, boy.  There were certain, I will say this, there was absolutely an Occupy Wall Street kind of  message, which, again, I don't mind, but when a movie gives me a message and it's a Batman  movie, I don't really need a social message from a Batman movie.  A side note to that, when I was down at Occupy Wall Street filming my shit, they were filming  Batman down on the stock exchange and they had all the streets shut down, but I did see  the Batmobile. 
[00:20:30]  Some of those things you watch and go, how the fuck did they film that in New York without  just completely shutting the city down?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is Bane a character from the comic book?  Oh, God.  It's an old character.  It's been around forever.  I thought so.  Okay.  So then, it's been a, yeah, sorry.  So then, dumb Russian shot about Bane Capital because it's a real character.  It was in one of the other movies.  It was in the last, funny.  In the last series of movies, too, Bane was in.  Oh, who played him?  Just some big dopey wrestler guy.  He had no.  It was one of the, it was in the. 
[00:21:00]  The one with Uma Thurman?  Yeah, with Poison Ivy.  Oh, way back.  Oh, was that a terrible scene?  He didn't even.  Let me see what that version of Bane looked like.  Oh, way back.  You don't even see Bane's face.  It's a full, like, mask covering him.  He has a mask on.  Is he supposed to have a mask?  Yeah, he has a mask.  That little apparatus thing around his mouth there in the comic book.  But in that old movie, they covered his whole head.  Yeah, that looks a little more like the comic book, too.  It's crazy.  Wait, that's from the other movie?  Yeah.  No shit.  I hated the Poison Ivy moment when she is born Poison Ivy. 
[00:21:30]  They were very cartoony back then.  The new ones are much better.  Yeah, they're a bit darker.  Heath Ledger just ruined it for me because he gave one of those weird,  performance, like, one of those, like, all-time great bad guy performance.  Like, he gave a fucking, Patrice would love this,  Sergeant Barnes in Pertune-type performance.  Like, one of those where it's like you could literally just watch his scenes  from the movie and love it.  And you started rooting for him in a way, in a strange way. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Well, here's Russ Limbaugh.  He's making a little stretch here.  All right.  Have you heard this new movie, the Batman movie?  What's wrong with his voice?  He's deaf.  Isn't his hearing fixed?  No, he got one of those cochlear implants.  But it doesn't completely fix your fucking hearing.  That motherfucker went deaf completely.  What really happened to him?  And then they shoved some fucking electronics in his ear, 
[00:22:30]  but he can't really hear himself very well.  Wow.  It's very mechanical or something.  It sounds like this.  Russ Limbaugh.  There's a Batman movie.  And I'm watching it in the Bane Capitol.  Russ Limbaugh.  Why did he have...  What happened to him?  Excellence in broadcasting.  What happened to his hearing?  Well, there's rumors.  There are rumors.  Some people thought it was drug-induced.  Yeah, too many pills. 
[00:23:00]  That he took a lot of them pills and went deaf.  Can you?  I don't even know.  I don't know.  Maybe that's a question for Dr. Steve.  That's just a rumor, yeah.  I never heard that.  I didn't realize he sounded like this.  But, yeah.  How are we getting one of these things going?  Have you heard this new movie, the Batman movie?  What is the Dark Knight Lights Up or something?  Whatever the name of it is.  That's right.  Dark Knight Rises, Lights Up, same thing.  Do you know the name of the villain in this movie? 
[00:23:30]  Oh, Russ, don't do it.  Bane.  Oh, boy.  He looks stupid.  The villain in The Dark Knight Rises is named Bane.  This is so stupid.  B-A-N-E.  What is the name of the venture capital firm that Romney ran and around which there's now this make-believe controversy?  The Joker or something?  Bane.  Joker.  The Joker capital.  You know what?  Rush might have a point as far as... 
[00:24:00]  Because I felt I didn't tie in Bane capital.  But there was an absolute get-the-rich, Occupy Wall Street kind of message.  And Bane, that might be why they went with this bad guy as opposed to other Batman villains.  They might have wanted the social message.  But the Bane capital thing didn't really, really get some steam until well after they started filming this fucking movie.  Yeah, maybe right.  You know?  They started filming this a while ago.  Yeah.  All right.  Fair enough.  We didn't even know Mitt Romney was going to be the nominee. 
[00:24:30]  I mean, like I said, a year ago I was down at Occupy Wall Street and they were already filming the stock market scenes.  And the whole Occupy Wall Street thing that, like, in this movie, it doesn't come across looking very good.  No, they don't clarify it.  Yeah, it's not like, you know.  That's the dregs of society in this movie.  I leaned over a few times and went, man!  The dirty white shit that was happening, yeah.  Wall Street, man!  Yeah, it was down and dirty.  It's Batman! 
[00:25:00]  Wall Street, man!  Oh, you think you're going to stop us, Batman?  Hey, man.  It's my favorite.  And around which there's now this make-believe controversy.  Bane.  The movie has been in the works for a long time.  The release date's been known summer 2012 for a long time.  Do you think that it is accidental that the name of the really vicious, fire-breathing, four-eyed, whatever it is, villain in this movie is named Bane? 
[00:25:30]  He's moving into Jesse Ventura territory.  That's crazy talk.  He's moving into that Ventura territory with this conspiracy shit.  Even I'd fucking say that's crazy talk.  Yeah, sometimes it's just a coincidence, man.  God damn.  That's crazy talk, Rush.  That the name of the really vicious, fire-breathing, four-eyed, whatever it is, villain in this movie is named Bane. 
[00:26:00]  And there's now discussion out there as to whether or not this was purposeful and whether or not it'll influence voters.  It's going to have a lot of people.  This movie, the audience is going to be huge.  A lot of people are going to see the movie.  A lot of people are going to see the movie.  And it's a lot of brain-dead people, entertainment, the pop culture crowd, and they're going to hear Bane in the movie.  Does he have a hair lip now?  I don't know what happened.  But it's a, it's, it's, it's front of, front of these. 
[00:26:30]  I also saw them looking at a bush.  There was a few butches in the movie.  And all I saw was a bush.  And they ran it over with a truck.  And now I'm noticing that was it done on purpose?  I don't know.  I noticed that one guy from the future had a ray gun.  A Ronald ray gun?  It could have been.  It could have been. 
[00:27:00]  This is for part of it.  There seems to be too much air escaping from his lip, too, though.  Yes, yes.  There's a fuff in there.  Vamidivagun.  This is fucking crazy.  Are we listening to Norm Crosby or Rush Limbaugh?  That is an insane person talking.  Come on, Bane Capital and Bane.  You know what?  It's not a stretch to say that voters will be influenced.  But this is a coincidence, you dummy. 
[00:27:30]  Because people are dumb like that.  There are dumb people.  If you're voting based on a Batman movie, wow, please stay home.  No, there will be a few that will.  And it's a lot of brain-dead people, entertainment, the pop culture crowd, and they're going to  hear Bane in the movie, and they're going to associate Bane, and the thought is that  when they start paying attention to the campaign later in the year, and Obama, the Democrats  keep talking about Bane, not Bane Capital, but Bane, Romney, and Bane, that these people  will think back to the Batman movie. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, yeah, I know who they are.  It's kind of the way the Democrats, the Republicans harped on Barack Obama and Hussein Obama and  fucking Saddam Hussein.  Yeah, I don't mind.  It's silly.  Sometimes that goes around and comes around, stupid.  Yeah, sometimes that shit just works out.  I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you.  Yeah.  But Barack Hussein, you know, Obama, it's just crazy to think.  Hey, do you think it's a coincidence that Bane sound like McCain? 
[00:28:30]  It didn't affect the election with the middle name Hussein, and a lot of people thought that  would, remember?  Yeah.  Gotta go back.  Gotta go back a few years.  Yeah.  And Bane, that these people will think back to the Batman movie.  Oh, yeah, I know who that is.  That's, there are some people who think it'll work.  There's some people who think it'll work.  Others think, yeah, you're really, you're really understanding how they think that'll 
[00:29:00]  work.  Oh, my God.  A Bane character who's a terrorist.  He's out to destroy.  Oh, that's his thing.  He, like, constantly has to pound.  Yeah.  He's always fidgeting.  It always sounds like he's wrapping up what he's about to say.  Right.  That's obviously a basic method.  We got about 20 seconds left for this.  A Bane character who's a terrorist.  He's out to destroy Gotham, New York City.  Which is the case in every Batman movie. 
[00:29:30]  But instead of, Senator Romney sounds like an Occupy Wall Street guy.  You may think it's ridiculous.  I'm going to tell you, this is the kind of stuff the Obama team is lining up.  What?  The Obama team?  The kind of people who would draw this comparison are the kind of people that they are campaigning  to.  All right.  He's making a huge stretch, obviously.  It's a coincidence.  And the Occupy Wall Street, like we've mentioned, it doesn't glorify it whatsoever.  And I think he knows he's making this stretch.  In this moment, he's a smart dude just talking about something because it's there. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  The Batman movie.  You say Batman.  You can't say his T's anymore?  I don't know.  Mad Man!  We got Rich Voss.  He's been on hold.  Oh, boy.  Rich, sorry about that, but we all saw Dark Knight last night.  Oh, you must have went to the premiere.  You guys are big.  Screaming.  Can you take us off, speaker, please?  Yeah, you sound like Bane.  Hold on, hold on. 
[00:30:30]  It's hard enough to understand you, and now you're going to put us on a speakerphone.  It's the villain, Inane.  You're interested to see what extremists these political talk show hosts are.  And if you think Rush is extreme, that other douchebag, Beck, is more extreme only with a chalkboard.  He got you pretty good yesterday.  Wow.  That was some good audio, man.  You've got to be honest.  I didn't hear it. 
[00:31:00]  I'm not going to listen to it.  I hear it because some hack radio producer or some ex-zoo, morning-zoo radio guy attacks me.  What gets me is, and Anthony would know this being, you know, like a Dago, if you're with  the Colombo family and the Gambino family went after somebody in the Colombo family, the  Colombo family would probably stick up for...  Oh, boy.  You mean instead of howling with laughter? 
[00:31:30]  See, you've got to listen to the audio.  We were howling.  It was hilarious, his take on you.  He's very angry with us for not sticking up so far.  No, he's more mad at you.  Because he feels like you're like a, you know, you should be...  I think he's angry with the whole show.  Are you angry with the whole show, Rich?  No, no.  Here's the...  Here's the...  All I did...  All I did...  I know you're trying not to say it, but just say it.  Here's the thing.  It gives you a nice rhythm.  Just say, here's the thing.  It's okay.  Okay.  Here's the thing.  All right, guys.  When I was a studio last Thursday, all I said to Anthony was, why wouldn't people want free health care? 
[00:32:00]  Right.  I didn't say I knew about their health care.  I didn't say I thought it was free or I didn't think it was free.  All I said was, I paid $20,000 a year, which I would not like to pay.  Okay?  It's Glenn Beck's job to know all of this.  It's not mine.  It's not my job.  My job is to do what I do, and I do it well. 
[00:32:30]  And I'll be doing it well in North Carolina at Good Nights this weekend.  And playing Pinehurst, too.  So, you know, it's not my job to know everything politically.  How about something?  I know a lot.  I know Obama told Netanyahu to give up his borders, and that's what.  Stop trying to squeeze in something that you just read because you got mauled.  What does he do? 
[00:33:00]  Here's the thing.  You guys should every now and then stick up.  Oh, Rich.  No, you would attack Glenn Beck in a second.  Yeah, we have.  You're right, because believe me, he never stood up for you guys when you were going through a hard time.  We don't care about Glenn Beck.  We don't care about Glenn Beck, Rich.  It was funny, though, to hear one of our friends trying to make a real point and then just have a political guy. 
[00:33:30]  And getting smashed.  Yeah, that's what was funny.  We would have done that to anybody.  We don't care about Glenn Beck.  Yeah, but I wasn't trying to make a point.  Yes, you were.  I was asking a question.  I said, if you play it back Thursday, I said, you know, what's wrong if we could get free health care?  That's what I said.  I wasn't making a point.  I was asking a question.  I was asking Anthony because Anthony's pretty, you know, I'm not going to say he's a creep, but he's pretty smart when it comes to this stuff.  Ace is high. 
[00:34:00]  And I tried to bring Commissioner Webb on to debate me, but he won't.  It's like Ace Ross.  Shut up.  So he destroyed Glenn Beck, distorted what I said.  Was I at the dinner?  Did I ask if health care was free?  Yes, you did only ask if health care was free.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Beck.  We're looking at a picture of you in the American Indian headdress.  You look silly. 
[00:34:30]  Hilarious.  Well, he was dressing up for us.  Rich, don't get all pissy with us because we laughed.  You know, get pissy with Glenn Beck.  Get pissy with yourself for, you know.  Knowing nothing.  Coming off.  Yeah, you sound a little uninformed, which, you know, that's fine.  Okay, thank you.  I'm not pissed off at you guys.  I'm not pissed off at anybody.  You know, it's good.  Beck is talking about this for us.  That's just going to help see these sales.  Yeah, there you go.  But because someone's informed, that's why they asked.  That's why I asked you.  Now I am informed. 
[00:35:00]  How do people get informed?  By asking.  By reading.  By reading.  By watching.  Okay?  So...  The question, Rich, is how does somebody become so completely uninformed?  Please.  You wouldn't understand half the health care bill.  Okay?  Just like...  Excellent response.  Yes, I would.  I've read the health care bill.  I've read all of it.  No, you didn't.  Yes, I have.  No, you didn't.  I've read it all.  I read the abridged.  I had it summed up for me.  And I kind of agree with everything but subsection five. 
[00:35:30]  I read it all, then I had it summed up for me.  Yeah.  Okay?  Anthony summed it up for me.  That's all.  So now I know.  Okay?  So, you know, that...  Whatever.  I don't know.  I just...  You know, I'm reading that you guys...  Like, I didn't hear.  I just thought you guys were smashing me again, which is okay.  We were laughing at...  We were howling.  He had a really funny take on you. 
[00:36:00]  That's all.  Yeah, but it wasn't even Glenn Beckham, who was the stupid producer, right?  Whoever it was, it was funny.  That means you heard the audio.  I think they were both...  No, no, no, no, I'm reading.  I read it.  No, it was both of them going back and forth.  All right.  Well...  I mean, they didn't have your voice down at all, but...  No.  Okay.  I mean...  They had the essence of you, though.  You were just doing a generic idiot.  Yeah.  A generic kind of Italian idiot.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, because I asked you a question.  I guess that's what an idiot does, is try to find out. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  What are you saying about Netanyahu now?  No, I didn't say anything.  I said when...  It's his favorite website.  And Net and Google.  What concerned me more is when Obama told Israel to give up their borders.  Okay?  Because that concerned me.  Because if Israel did that, it would weaken their defense.  And any anti...  What do you care about what goes on in Israel?  Anyway, because anti-Semitism throughout Europe and the Middle East flows over here. 
[00:37:00]  Because he doesn't inform people.  Yeah, it does.  Then why are we all scared of the Jiz?  No.  Because they could fire you.  That's what I'm saying.  They have quite a lot of power.  So what are you talking about?  We're all scared of the Jiz.  It's kind of weird.  It's kind of strange that 3% of the population has so much power.  It doesn't say a lot for the other people.  Nah, well, we went into the business that they own.  The media business. 
[00:37:30]  They own the media.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  They don't own it.  The advertisers own it.  Okay?  That they own it.  Whoa!  Advertisers.  They run it.  They run it.  Right.  They don't own it.  Well, the reason they run it, Rich, is because the Jews allow them to run it because  the Jews are afraid of their money being affected.  Oh, boy.  Spoken like a true white supremacist.  Right.  Listen to you.  No, the advertisers.  Rich is right.  The advertisers do, actually.  So why don't we allow Rich Voss to respond to the Glenn Beck thing? 
[00:38:00]  What do you have to say about Glenn Beck?  Yeah.  Fireback.  Yeah, fireback.  Let's see.  What do you want to say about that blowhard?  Let's go.  I don't really have any.  What am I going to say?  The guy, you know, he failed on his comedy tour.  Okay?  He's not a comedian.  He went on tour to do stand-up.  Okay?  And that failed miserably.  He's a failed morning zoo guy.  All right.  So now he's a political guy that lives in the shadows of Hannity, Rush. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  Can I stop you there?  I know a little bit about radio.  And I'll tell you this much.  I don't agree with a lot of things Glenn Beck says, but he turned his failed morning zoo persona  into a $100 million contract.  He's far from a failure in radio.  He's getting that every day, though.  Yeah, but here's the thing.  If he got fired and was offered $110 million to do liberal radio, he'd be there in a second. 
[00:39:00]  So what?  And so he's an act.  What I do is...  They all are.  Yeah, they all are.  I don't take any of these guys.  Dude, if they fired me and told me, like, to stop telling jokes, like, I'm going to pause here.  But maybe they should fire me and tell me to start.  But they're all acting, Rich, because I'll tell you this much.  As far as their radio careers go, they want Obama to be re-elected.  It's great for business.  They absolutely, Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh, are hoping that Obama gets re-elected, because 
[00:39:30]  it's great for their business.  Oh, yeah, yeah, because there's something to talk about.  Yeah.  Rush Limbaugh became a huge star because of Clinton.  Bill Clinton made me a lot of money, and my money don't come in.  Yeah.  You're saying Glenn Beck makes $100 million?  He just signed a $100 million radio contract.  And then you have to think about the money he's making by doing the TV show on the Internet.  Okay, well, I've got to say. 
[00:40:00]  That's a separate business.  I agree with most of the stuff Glenn Beck says, and I'm a big fan of Glenn Beck's.  Glenn Beck's.  Glenn Beck, or whatever.  I didn't know he made $100 million, and I guess what he was saying about me is correct.  And I have to agree with Glenn Beck.  Oh.  And I'm an ass.  I'm a jackass.  It's not that you're a jackass.  We were howling because he just kind of nailed you as far as what you said that day.  That's all.  He was just taking one point you made, and he made it very funny because we just know you. 
[00:40:30]  All my kids would ask you a question.  But that's okay.  I didn't know he was worth that much, and he was that day.  So I'm going to have to try to jump on the Glenn Beck bandwagon.  I'm going to have to call him and say, you know what, Mr. Beck, I agree with you.  Well, listen, Rich, we've got to eat.  Yes, indeed.  Where are you off to?  It sounds like you're in a car.  Are you flying this morning?  Yeah, I'm going to Good Nights in Raleigh.  Where?  Good Nights in Raleigh. 
[00:41:00]  Good Nights in Raleigh.  Okay.  And I'm playing Pinehurst.  I'm there.  Pinehurst 2.  What do you care more about, Good Nights or Pinehurst?  Pinehurst.  Of course.  You're an honest man, Rich Voss.  You're an honest man.  Okay.  Well, golf.  All right.  Well, listen, we have to talk again.  I'll see you guys.  All right, buddy.  Who wins the British Open?  Because it starts tomorrow.  Who's going to win?  Mm-hmm.  I hope to God it's John Daly.  I hope he does.  I hope he does.  John Daly?  Is he even playing?  Yeah, he's playing. 
[00:41:30]  He's exempt because he won there, so he's lifetime exempt.  All right.  Well, he doesn't...  Do we feel he was in the top 12?  In other words, he was 12.  You picked the long shot.  You're right.  I like the underdog.  Like a true gambling addict.  Huh?  I like the underdog because I've been an underdog.  Can I tell you something about the British Open?  I also like sweet poly purebred.  Let me tell you something about the British Open and why his pick is ridiculous.  The British Open, especially, you have to hit accurate shots. 
[00:42:00]  Yes, John Daly is a lunatic.  No.  Wait, did you just say in golf you have to hit accurate shots?  You jacked it.  You know what, Bob?  Yeah, but what I'm saying, okay, I'll debate you on this point.  Uh-oh.  But the British Open specifically, and Travis will back me up, you can't fucking hit it  in the rough as much as other places.  You'll get fucked, and John Daly never hits a goddamn fairway, so yeah, he's fucked.  Listen, you stupid part-time golfer, in any major, in any tournament, one fucking stroke 
[00:42:30]  to size, so you've got to hit it in the fairway in every tournament.  You know, when you're in a NASCAR race, you can't run into the wall.  I will bet you $1,000, but you don't bet anymore that John Daly doesn't even make the  cut.  First, give me odds.  I'll bet you.  You're not supposed to bet.  I mean, I'm not supposed to do a lot of things, okay?  All right? 
[00:43:00]  All right.  Well, listen.  All right, Rich.  Thanks for having me on.  It was a pleasure.  First time in a long time.  I gotta help.  All right, Rich.  What is it?  Good nights in Raleigh, you said?  Yeah, it's a good club.  It's a really good club.  Yeah.  Great club.  And Raleigh.  They're just saying you have to be more accurate than usual to win this British Open.  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah.  You want to eat?  Yeah.  We've got a really busy day.  Holy fuck.  Oh, not really, because DL Hughley had to fly back to L.A. 
[00:43:30]  He's not doing our show today, and a lot of people were looking forward to having DL  on the show, because he's great.  But we do have Gary Oldman.  Which is very fucking cool.  From The Dark Knight.  Yes.  Who's a very, very good guest.  Gary Oldman's going to be, Gary Oldman is going to be his place, Commissioner God,  and our Batman.  After you sign it, you have our permission to come up.  Jimmy's really got it down.  That's crazy. 
[00:44:00]  And then McFoley's coming by a little later.  Ooh.  He was asking for a favor.  He needs to come in today.  What's up?  What's he doing?  He's got a bunch of comedy gigs starting tonight through Saturday.  Cool.  And then he's going to be on Raw on Monday.  Monday night.  Are they using him again?  Yeah, they're doing the 1,000th episode, so they're bringing back a whole bunch of people.  Who else?  The Rock's going to be there.  Brock Lesnar.  Wow.  Has Brock wrestled?  Brock wrestled John Cena in what many are describing as possible match of the year candidate. 
[00:44:30]  When was that?  April.  Was it a good match?  End of April?  Yeah, it was really good.  So he hasn't wrestled since April?  He wrestled one match in April.  But it's fake.  How is it good?  But I thought he was back with...  Well, you could still do it.  So was Batman.  Did you enjoy it?  Well...  It wasn't actually happening.  Yeah, but I knew, like...  Gotham doesn't even exist.  But you said it was a good match, but it's like...  Like a good movie.  Like a good...  That's like saying that Batman's a good documentary.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, it's not.  It's still a match. 
[00:45:00]  It's a good movie.  It's a good match.  You young shot.  We don't even know what race you are.  But he does look like Kirsten Bell.  We brought that up last week.  Thank you.  Yes.  Wait, were you here for that?  I was here, yeah.  I'm the one who brought it up to you.  And then you agreed with me.  Yes.  Yeah.  I'll see it now.  Bad out of me, either.  When you went side to side, you guys were like, holy shit.  You're looking more like Maggie Gyllenhaal's clit, but the fuck that bitch is...  Gyllenhaal.  Gyllenhaal.  Gyllenhaal. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, boy, do I hate that.  Yeah, I hate that.  I know.  So loud, I'm trying to sleep.  Or the foyer.  I was trying to say Gyllenhaal's clit, and I got anxious.  Gyllenhaal.  Gyllenhaal.  I want me, Gyllenhaal.  Nice.  Or the foyer.  Ah, shit.  I don't like her.  No, no.  I am not a fan of hers.  Dumb, fat chipmunk cheeks.  She really is an idiot.  Yeah.  Okay, just tell me what's going on with you. 
[00:46:00]  I was so happy when they fucking burned her.  Oh, when they burnt her alive.  Just tell me what's going on with you.  Oh, they're saving him.  Yeah.  Stupid.  While you sit there and fucking fires all of you.  Don't burn.  Burn, fat cheeks.  Here's the other side of this, because people are tweeting.  Hugh Knowit wrote, I think what Rush is trying to say is that Obama's team is harping on  Bane to take advantage of the coincidence of the two names. 
[00:46:30]  Oh.  Oh, so he's saying that Obama's camp will harp on Bane.  And take advantage of this a little bit.  People make this assumption.  Oh, maybe.  And the movie really wasn't trying to do anything.  And someone else writes, Starman622, you missed it with Rush's Helen Keller voice, but  the Dems are already making the Bane remarks.  It was on PIX11 News last night.  Oh, boy.  Will you grab that clip maybe, Sam?  PIX11 News.  If there's anything there.  Damn. 
[00:47:00]  That's crazy.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll eat.  Can I have Tom put this on, please?  Thomas, I've got to find this man.  Let's get Tom and put this back on.  Let's go again.  Someone knows where he is.  Shut up for a second, all right?  I'm sorry.  No, don't just be sorry.  Think for one fucking second.  You can triangulate his position.  What the fuck is it with you?  I'm going to fucking kick your fucking ass.  Do you trust him?  You do it one more fucking time.  What do you expect to learn from him?  I want you off the fucking set, you prick.  Because that's what needs to happen. 
[00:47:30]  Are you professional or not?  I'm Batman.  Oh, good for you.  Fuck's sake, man, you're amateur.  This is the second time that he doesn't give a fuck.  It's the first.  You're un-fucking-believable.  Look, G, you got fucking something to say to this prick?  He can wait.  If I get him to you, can you get him to talk?  Seriously, man, you and me, we're fucking done professionally.  Stay off the fucking set, man.  Fucking ass.  Sirius XM, this is the OPN3 Show. 
[00:48:00]  Ant went and saw Colin Quinn last night, and wow.  I did want to bring that up.  I can't hear at all.  Huh?  No?  You don't have headphones?  You all right?  Well, you jiggle it.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  What happened, Jimmy?  I put the wrong headphones on.  I can't hear, damn it.  I'm not limbo. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  You saw Colin Quinn last night, and you're giving him rave reviews, and he's working on  new shit.  This is brand new stuff he's working on, and it's so, he is, and you could say someone's  smart doesn't necessarily mean they're fucking funny.  Right.  You know?  He is so informed about what's going on in the world, and he makes it so fucking funny.  It was great.  It was just fucking great.  Free show in Long Island City, because he's working on new shit. 
[00:49:00]  You know, he had papers with him and stuff, but it was just amazing.  Talking about bullying, and the founding fathers, and banking, and he just takes everything that's  in the news now, and the basic attitude of the American people right now, as far as  their government goes, and things, and just is fucking hilarious.  So goddamn funny.  And he does the work.  Like, that's the thing with Colin.  We were talking about why he's so good. 
[00:49:30]  He bombs.  And I'm saying that, I'm not a shit on him.  He's willing to work through.  Oh, yeah.  At the cellar, or wherever he's working, things that aren't working yet to get them  to work.  He doesn't bail on them and cheapen them by fucking, and that's why he's so great.  He takes chances, which a lot of people are scared to do.  He takes chances on stage.  People are scared to fail, so they never take those chances.  He's not scared to fail.  And if you're brave enough to fail, you will get yourself to some really good places.  Yeah, and that's what he does.  And a lot of people don't really understand that concept. 
[00:50:00]  And he opened up pretty much talking about Long Island City, because that's where it  was.  His take on Long Island City is hilarious.  What's his take for the locals?  It's just such a weird place.  It's in between the biggest city in the world and suburbia out on Long Island.  And they don't quite know what they are.  They're kind of a mix between the two.  He's talking about these factories that are like old-time factories that only employ like  five people, and they're still there.  And how there's just one person on every street. 
[00:50:30]  That's weird.  You just walk around.  It was a great take on such a weird fucking place.  They're rebuilding Long Island City in front of our eyes for us old-school New York people.  It's really strange, because no one used to go there.  They're building these buildings that are half-full, yet they'll build three more of them.  They're beautiful buildings.  And you can see the skyline of New York from your living room.  Oh, yeah.  Are they luxury condos and stuff?  Yeah, it's right on the other side of the East River.  They're beautiful. 
[00:51:00]  And there's more going up.  All glass.  Right on the river.  Are they all full?  No.  No.  And they're hoping the people come.  You know who had an apartment there?  Nicolini.  Nope.  If you remember, Jill Nicolini had an apartment there.  And it was great.  It just overlooks the fucking river from the other side of Manhattan.  What's the difference?  And they got a subway line that goes right the fuck into Manhattan.  I did take it.  I swear.  I met Roland for brunch over the weekend.  And it's like you're in a tiny town. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  We went and had a little lunch, and there was nobody around.  It was just a tiny little place.  It is.  Yeah.  But these cool businesses are popping up in restaurants.  So they're building it up?  I should look over there.  Oh, yeah, they are.  It's right over the river?  Yeah.  Right there.  It's right over the river.  You get a lot more for your money over there.  Oh, hells yeah.  The difference between Manhattan apartment and Long Island City?  Probably half the price, I would imagine.  Amazing.  Yeah.  They're hoping it becomes this huge, you know, nice thing.  It's Trav? 
[00:52:00]  It's the new Williamsburg.  Yeah.  And the same thing's going to happen.  They're going to build way too many luxury apartments, and it's just going to be empty  buildings of luxury apartments.  Is that in Williamsburg?  Yeah.  There's a shitload of apartments in there that they can't sell.  Is there availability there?  In Williamsburg?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  But it's a terrible neighborhood to live in because it's got the highest noise complaints  in the city.  Really?  Why?  Because there's so many, like, you know, you want to say, quote unquote, hipster kids.  Younger hipsters, yeah.  You know, that are living on their parents' dime that go there, and there's still a lot 
[00:52:30]  of not bad neighborhoods, but not great.  I mean, there's just a lot of noise.  But Long Island City's going to do the same thing.  So could you get a good deal?  Compared to Manhattan?  I'm sure you could.  Compared to Manhattan, yeah, sure.  But, like, compared to, you know, the further out you go, you know, the less you pay.  But it is kind of...  I was just laughing because, you know, you're talking about Long Island City.  They got their own subway.  The subway goes right there.  It's amazing. 
[00:53:00]  They got this thing.  It's a train that runs underground.  Underground?  A train that runs underground.  Perhaps I'll blow it up.  That's what they do.  You've got more bang for your buck, as Travis said.  You have my permission to sublet.  And then Bushwick.  Bushwick's going to be the next Long Island City.  Bushwick.  Yes.  Yes.  I want you to Bush.  Is it like a Bush candle or something? 
[00:53:30]  I'm Chipper Bane.  Chipper Bane.  I smell production peas.  I love Chipper Bane.  Well, I'm going to look at Long Island City now because I might be starting to look soon.  Yeah.  I mean, Roland's got a great place, you know.  And for what you have now, you can get so much more.  Roland has a nice little apartment.  I have a 10 by 10 apartment right now that I paid a half a million dollars for.  You can put your head out the window and bang cymbals.  No one knows the turkey. 
[00:54:00]  The Jeremy Lin thing is officially over.  I need a minute here.  I'm very depressed.  I'm just like a lot of Knicks fans because a lot of us came back to the Knicks when Jeremy Lin started doing his thing.  It turns out he was a Knick for like seven weeks and that's it.  It's done.  It's done.  It's done.  They couldn't match the offer because the Rockets, you know.  Seven weeks.  That third, pretty much.  That's it.  He did his thing for seven weeks.  His sanity lasted fucking seven weeks.  Yeah, and then he got injured and, you know. 
[00:54:30]  And the Rockets made an offer and the Knicks can't match it because they're going to get penalized $35 million or something like that.  They back-ended Jeremy Lin's contract.  The third year was the killer.  They're giving him like $14, $15 million for that third year and the Knicks just can't do it.  And the Knicks fans are fucking depressed today, man.  Because now we've got dumb Jason Kidd who was brought on to, you know, teach Jeremy Lin a thing or two.  A thing or two about a thing or two. 
[00:55:00]  And now we've got to depend on Carmelo Anthony who's an amazing basketball player, but he's the type of player you don't win championships with.  Period.  Period.  Sorry, my nostrils.  And some of the finances, Ant, really quick.  Yeah.  The parent company of Madison Square Garden and the Knicks, when Jeremy Lin hit for those seven weeks, their value went up $600 million.  Jesus.  That's how important Linsanity was for everybody.  The value went up $600 million. 
[00:55:30]  Well, now they lose all that.  Well, this is what I was thinking.  I mean, I know it's a crazy contract, but you got Jeremy Lin for free, basically, last year, as far as sports salaries go.  Yeah.  You got him for free.  He was making nothing.  Right.  And the value of the parent company went up $600 million basically because of this guy.  A lot of people would point to Jeremy Lin and why the value went up $600 million.  Since the rumor of his departure, about three or four days ago, they said, oh, fuck, Jeremy Lin is probably leaving the Knicks. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  The value of the company went down $50 million.  So, to me, it's like...  It's costing them anyway.  To me, it makes good business sense to just fucking, you know, bite the bullet on this one.  Take that fine?  But this all doesn't matter because it's over.  I mean, it is over.  Jeremy Lin is now a Rocket.  And people are sick about it today.  Just sick.  Well, they'll go Linsane over there.  And the funny thing is, the Rockets cut him last year.  So, the Rockets cut this guy. 
[00:56:30]  And now they bring him back at just...  For huge bucks.  Yeah.  Sick numbers for Jeremy Lin, especially.  Who makes those decisions?  Huh?  Who makes those decisions?  Like, yeah, we'll cut him.  Well, I'll pay him.  Bye.  He's great now.  And they have the room, so they don't get that penalty shit.  They can give him that crazy third-year contract.  Yeah.  And they don't have the penalty on top of it.  So, fucking New Yorkers who like the Knicks and this whole insanity thing are fucking bummed out today.  I don't know anything about the basketball. 
[00:57:00]  Plus, he was a great cheerleader.  He was just a great presence on the fucking team.  Just wait until he goes back to being not good, and then everybody will be like, oh, I'm so glad.  Well, that's what the Knicks are banking on.  That maybe this was just a fluky thing.  I still think it's a fluke.  He had three good weeks.  He was cut by two teams last year.  There's no, like, you know.  Yeah, we'll see.  I would have liked to see him stay, because it brought me back to the team.  I like his velvety haircut.  That stuff's great.  I think that's fucking coobie. 
[00:57:30]  I think that's the ABCs of the Jeremy Lin thing, though, pretty much.  Pretty much.  But the value is drastically dropping, so I don't know.  Yeah.  We'll see.  Well, I won't.  I'll hear from you guys.  Yeah, exactly.  He does well.  I'll hear from you guys.  I won't see, because I don't watch much of the basketball.  I don't even know who else is on the Rockets.  I don't even know.  I like watching the football.  The football. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, my God.  Do you like that scene in Batman with the field coercing?  Oh, wow.  What do you say?  That's in the trailer.  It's in the trailer.  It's in the trailer.  We can talk about things in the trailer.  Yeah, that was pretty cool.  That was cool, too, right?  The effects were really good.  The effects were really fucking good.  Yeah.  CGI, the way they tie it into the real film, it's fucking fantastical.  Uh, remember we said that the Bane thing that Russ brought up? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  And then someone said PIX11 did a little something on it already.  PIX11 really fucking, uh, kind of working their journalistic chops, I guess, huh?  Yes.  Yes.  PIX.  Mitt Romney's critics may have found a new way to skewer the GOP candidate via the soon-to-be-released Hollywood blockbuster,  The Dark Knight Rises, the final movie in the Batman franchise.  As Romney's luck would have it, the villain of the piece is named Bane, B-A-N-E. 
[00:59:00]  Romney's foes say the name of the villain, sounding like the name of Romney's company, Bane Capital, B-A-I-N,  which is part of the president's campaign against him, is just too rich to ignore.  That's it, huh?  Yeah, they're just dumb.  That's their big...  They're just stupid.  The news is just...  Making that whole connection is silly.  It's a bit of a stretch.  It really is.  It is a coincidence.  That's what the fuck you're talking about!  Exactly.  I don't, uh... 
[00:59:30]  I don't get what the whole hubbub is about Bane Capital anyway.  That's nice language.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I apologize to people that were offended by hubbub.  The hubbub.  Yes.  That was in a cartoon when I was a kid.  I remember somebody saying that.  What's all the hubbub, bub?  I think Bugs Bunny said it.  Uh, yeah, I don't see what it's all about.  This whole Bane Capital thing.  And when Romney was working for him, and when he left, and when...  Who gives a shit? 
[01:00:00]  Well...  Like, who cares?  A lot of people, obviously.  A lot of people care because it's a distraction.  From, you know, then it makes Romney have to spend more time defending himself against  some weird fucking allegation they're making, instead of bashing Obama on his record.  So, you know, the more shit they could throw at Romney, the less shit Romney could throw  back at Obama.  It's just...  And nothing... 
[01:00:30]  But that's how it's always worked.  Collins' take on that last night...  That's how it's always worked.  Collins' take on that last night was great.  What did he say?  He said the government isn't supposed to work.  He goes, all these...  You know, how the checks and balances, they say, were put in place years ago by those grand  founding fathers, there's so much shit there.  Like, no one's supposed to have so much power, or even a group of people, Congress or whatnot,  they're not supposed to have so much power that they can change things, that they can 
[01:01:00]  make these big changes.  It was never supposed to be that way.  So they put all these things in place that keep things just the way they are.  And things kind of move along at a very slow pace, but nothing is supposed to get done.  You're supposed to have this group of people saying, no, we don't want that.  We want that.  No, we don't want that.  They argue, and nothing gets done.  But the country kind of moves right along anyway.  And that's kind of the way it's supposed to work.  Aren't we better than that, though? 
[01:01:30]  He said that you do hope that every so often a good idea comes about and people will make  those compromises.  Believe me, I'm not doing it in the comedic style that Colin was doing.  I'm not trying to do it.  I'm just saying the ideas that he was bringing up make a lot of sense.  But maybe we're not better than that.  No, I don't think we are.  Maybe that's how it's supposed to be.  I don't think we are.  Kenny, could I have some tissues?  My right nostril's dripping like an old fucking, like a whore on Sunday.  He got that idea from me.  Because she has cum in her. 
[01:02:00]  We got it, though.  I know.  I love to think.  Did you panic there?  No, no.  Okay.  I just like doing the, you get it, and then blatantly saying what I meant.  Because I said to him, nobody works together, Colin.  He's like, that's a good point, Chipper.  So, Colin stole your...  Yeah, I was doing something about the Constitution.  You were doing something?  Yeah, I was just talking about it, Colin.  You were riffing?  Yeah, just joking about it.  Where?  At the cellar?  Were you on stage?  I was like, it's such a rolled up piece of...  Where do you play, Chip?  Where do you fucking go on stage?  Fast and Square Garden. 
[01:02:30]  I want to see this new...  Oh, there's a new UFC Chip TV on YouTube.  Oh, man.  I want to see this...  I really want to see Colin's new thing.  Because I can tell him he's working on it.  Really good.  How long was it, an hour?  Yeah, it was about an hour.  And, yeah, him just watching him work on shit like that is great.  Because he's fucking crushing.  I mean, people are laughing their asses off.  And then he'll hit on something where he's...  You can see he's struggling trying to get the bit together. 
[01:03:00]  And he's creating it.  And it's not quite working, but he just acknowledges it.  Yeah, okay.  He'll get it together.  I can't wait to see it.  Oh, fuck yeah.  We've got to get him on the show.  Why doesn't he do our show?  I know.  More, I should say.  He used to wake up and come running in.  He used to come in in his pajamas.  What happened?  Are you sleeping better?  Soaking his dumb fucking thing in tea.  Pouring tea on his biscuits.  Fucking British woman.  Oh, British woman.  I've got to steal the napkin.  I don't know what's happening here. 
[01:03:30]  My eye was itching and now my nostril's running.  You know, I mean...  What are you talking about?  Nobody understands either one of us.  In other news, stupid Boy Scouts reaffirmed their ban on gays.  What?  What is their problem with the gays?  I think they assume that gay goes hand in hand with pedophilia. 
[01:04:00]  And if there's a gay gentleman that is in charge of young children, young boys, that they might be apt to touch said voice.  I don't know how I'd feel if I was...  Like, I hate the Boy Scouts.  Hate them.  Because I think they're just goody-two-shoes.  I hated it.  But I don't know how I feel.  Like, for me, I'm like, they should let gays in.  But how would I feel if I was a parent?  I don't know.  It's easy to say, but would it bother me if I was a parent?  Would I worry about my 12 or 13-year-olds? 
[01:04:30]  First of all, if your fucking kid is loving the Boy Scouts, he's probably a douche.  Your kid's probably a douche.  You don't see that as a good stepping stone to learning responsibility and teamwork.  No, I'm sure you get good things out of it.  I'm sure there's good things in it, but I hate it being...  I don't know.  I don't think I officially made Boy Scouts.  What is it?  Were you a wee-blow?  Wee-blow.  No, what's below that?  Not wee-below.  Wee-blow.  It's wee-below.  Wee-blows.  Wee-blows.  You were in the wee-blows? 
[01:05:00]  I was a Cub Scout and then a wee-below.  Yuck.  But then not a...  Don't say wee-below.  It's wee-below.  Let me see it.  Wee-be-loyal scouts.  Wee-belows.  Is that higher than a Boy Scout?  Wee-be-loyal scouts.  Boy Scouts.  Is that higher than a Boy Scout?  No.  So how does it go?  It was Cub Scout, wee-below, boy scouts.  I was a Cub Scout and I said, this shit isn't for me.  Wolves, bears, wee-belows, Boy Scouts.  So I barely made it to the first stage and that was it?  Bullshit.  If you didn't make the wee-belows...  Just creepy.  They're all wearing those fucking faggity ascots walking around. 
[01:05:30]  Ascots.  Just fucking little things tied around their neck.  Grown men in shorts.  Come on, let's camp.  Instead of staying home and fucking your wife.  Assholes.  Come on, let's camp.  Yeah, it just stinks.  I like your take, Jimmy.  Yeah, that's hilarious.  Wee-belows.  Learn to tie this and do this just in case you're ever stuck in the woods for eight months.  What, you don't think getting a badge in knots is good?  It's valueless.  Yeah.  I have so many fucking belt loops. 
[01:06:00]  I have more belt loops than any.  Where do you mean belt loops?  Where do you get you?  What do you mean where do you get me?  What's the one thing you learned from the Boy Scouts?  How to have a little bit of integrity in this world.  Oh.  That's it?  Where did that go?  Can you start a fire?  Can you start a fire?  No, but I can tie a fucking mean square knot.  Who gives a fuck?  When you need a knot, you just know what to do.  Hey, what do you mean belt loops?  See the little loops on his belt like the triangles there?  No.  You get a little belt loop if you can accomplish something.  Oh, he goes on your belt.  You get a swimming belt loop.  And a marbles belt loop.  And a bowling.  What about a swastika armband? 
[01:06:30]  There you go.  No.  That's not we-  Did you earn that?  How do you earn that?  You're thinking of the Nazis.  Did you make it to Boy Scouts?  No, I left Boy Scouts because they made fun of-  Brown shirt organization.  The young kids.  Oh, no.  What'd they say?  And you didn't like that?  Well, I went in for a preview and they were making fun of the new- the old Boy Scouts were  making fun of the new Boy Scouts.  And I said, I don't want to be in that world.  Because Sam was so- his mother was so good to him and so loving, he couldn't handle B&T's.  Right.  What the fuck?  It's like when the new replacements came in.  You can't handle a little hazing? 
[01:07:00]  A little razin?  You haze every new guy that comes into this organization.  Yeah, you don't have a little razin?  I was in fifth grade.  You earn your keep and then when you earn respect, then you get it.  It's like the new guy's coming into the NOM.  Hazing's part of the world.  I didn't say it was bad.  I said I didn't want to do it.  It wasn't worth it.  Take a look at this piece of shit.  Yeah.  Tag him and bag him!  This biracial, we don't know what the hell he is.  Curly-haired, Yeti piece of shit.  Maybe they don't like your kind in the boys.  You only get hazed for something that you want to do.  Yeah. 
[01:07:30]  So if you don't want to do it-  Yeah, but you made it all the way to the Weeblows.  It's fifth grade.  That's four years.  That's not an accomplishment.  That's a lot.  I only made it to Cub Scouts.  I didn't even know what the next stage was.  You have no follow-through.  Nah, I hated it.  I really did hate it.  I also didn't like camping.  I didn't like being outdoors.  I liked camping, though.  Are you a pussy?  Any knot that wasn't a square knot, I had trouble with.  Jesus Christ.  I do like camping, though.  You do?  A little scary, but I like it.  I don't mind camping in comfortable weather.  What?  I don't want to camp. 
[01:08:00]  No, I just mean comfortable weather.  I don't have to be comfortable-  Do you do drive-by camping?  Or did you used to go into the woods and do some real camping?  Yeah, I used to fucking go camping, especially in California, man.  Riding horses into the fucking mountains and go camping.  For real?  Crazy, yeah.  You slept out there.  Real deal.  Not the drive-by lots and shit where, all right, your space is 27.  It's right next to the urls.  Not that shit.  You're talking-  I hate that.  Pitching the tent.  Yeah, that's scary, though.  And they're gathering the wood.  I hate-  Someone just Twittered, there's nothing worse than a grown man in a Boy Scouts uniform. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, they do look silly.  You really do look like an asshole in that outfit.  Excuse me, Scoutmaster Sandusky?  Can you help me with this?  You want to hear from a guy that learned what a blowjob was because of Boy Scouts?  Oh, sure.  Sam?  Yeah.  Oh.  Sam, you don't even know how to make a fire.  Why would I need to make a fire?  I live in a house.  You were in the Weeblos.  I bet you the Weeblos did fire shit.  Weeblos have lighters.  What?  Yeah, but that's cheating.  You don't need to make a fire. 
[01:09:00]  It's 2012.  Were they ever racially exclusive or no?  Need to eat.  They should have been.  I'm not going into the woods.  That's the whole thing.  Do you know how to kill anything to survive?  If I had, I'm sure you break a neck, you stab it, you strangle it.  They don't teach these kids nothing.  Yeah, he's doing wrestling moves.  You lay it down and you jump off the top rope and you put your thigh on its throat.  A leg drop on a little rabbit.  Rock bottom.  What year did the Boy Scouts come out?  Because were they racially segregated?  I'm sure.  Let's get Dana on the phone while Sam looks that up. 
[01:09:30]  Dana!  Boys, good morning.  Good morning.  This was more of a didactic session than a practical one.  So for my first trips, canoeing down in Satilla River in Georgia, I was about 11 years old, canoeing along.  And the older Boy Scouts were talking about a blowjob, blowjob.  Finally, I...  Gave him one.  I said, what's a blowjob?  And one of the guys said, well, it's one of the girls who sucks your cock. 
[01:10:00]  And I just remember thinking, well, that doesn't seem to make much sense.  Oh, boy.  Boy, what the hell's your problem?  That's the whole story?  That's the story, Jim.  You didn't get molested or face-fucked on the river?  I thought somebody...  Or face-fucked on the river.  This story stinks.  I thought somebody blew you or something.  I was hoping for a Huck Finn moment, where fucking, like, you know what, Jim, and fucking...  And then another boy held you down.  Someone whitewashed your face?  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  That's an amazing story, Dana.  Thank you.  Thanks for sharing.  Yeah.  Terrific.  All right.  It was founded in 1910, but I don't know exactly when.  Oh, that means they didn't allow the blacks.  No, probably.  No Negroes back then?  When did they allow the blacks?  I can't find that.  Are you allowing any Negroes?  Oh.  You want to go to Josh?  Want to try this one more time?  I hope he's not joshing.  My scout leader was a kid-toucher.  Of course he was.  He writes, and I was never touched, he says, but he knows people that were. 
[01:11:00]  Oh.  Josh?  Good morning.  Don't say his name, dummy, okay?  Thank you.  Yeah, my scout director, who actually doubled as my summer camp owner, was a child molester.  This was in 1986, I think it was.  Lucky dog.  Yeah.  And the camp, actually, they had to close down the camp in 1987.  That was my last summer there.  I personally wasn't touched.  Where was this place? 
[01:11:30]  Just say the name of the area.  You don't have to say the name.  You're just like, what state?  It was in suburban Philadelphia.  Oh, yeah.  What a mistake that was.  You remember that, Uncle Paul?  Sure.  I'd teach him how to, I'd put on my, I'd tie off my little, my little scarf-kerchief.  It's a handkerchief scarf.  Right.  And I'd teach the little kids how to, hey, wee below, here's how you tie the knot, put 
[01:12:00]  your hands behind your back.  Whoa.  Yeah, you teach them how to tie the knot by putting their hand behind their back.  What, would you tie their hands with the little hanker neckerchief?  Yeah, with the neck, the, uh, the necker handkerchief, and you tie their hands, and you kiss their bottom  until they break wind on you.  Yay.  Oh, yay.  I'm a wee below.  I'm like, me too.  I'm Scoutmaster Hargis.  Oh, imagine that. 
[01:12:30]  You have a wheel up there, and you gotta go to Scoutmaster Hargis?  Yeah, that's, how do you start a fire?  I'm like, you just flick your paw molds over there in the leaves.  Now get over there and put it out with your tinkle.  Start off.  Get in a tent.  Get in a tent with Scoutmaster Paul.  Oh, no.  You would share the tent with the boys?  Sure, one tent, nine boys.  Everybody, we would play, let's roll around like we're practicing if there's a fire. 
[01:13:00]  Everybody rolls around.  You stop, drop, and roll.  That's how you put the fire out.  And you gotta roll over the magic fire putter out a stick.  What is that?  Roll your bottom over this.  Little Cub Scout.  Yay, I didn't like the Boy Scouts.  No?  No.  Oh, that was, uh, are the kids older in Boy Scouts?  Is that?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I like when they're Cub Scouts.  Yeah?  Tiger Cubs are only first grade.  I know they are.  Who are you telling?  It's like teaching them hygiene after they started getting a little hair and... 
[01:13:30]  A little what?  Like hair.  Once you start getting hair, you know, you gotta start concentrating more on your hygiene.  Ah, go on.  I don't be bothered with that nonsense.  I like a little...  What are they called?  Tiger Cubs?  Tiger Cub.  Oh, okay.  You get them in there, you drop and roll over the bump.  Roll over the bump in the tent.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  Sure.  Sure.  Why else would I want to be in the woods?  Bunch of young boys.  Everybody's camping.  Here's how you keep that clean.  Woo-woo-woo-woo.  Woo-woo-woo-woo.  Woo-woo-woo-woo.  All right, Uncle Bryce.  That's enough for him.  Jesus.  You gotta clean your peenie off after you tinkle on the fire.  Well...  Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo.  We might want to take Eric in Jersey, because at Scout Camp, they made them take off their 
[01:14:30]  bathing suits while showering when no one wanted to.  That old gag.  We've done this a million fucking times.  I'm amazed by the amount of guys that had to take their bathing suits off in school and  Boy Scout and all that shit.  Yeah, a lot of these places you had to swim naked.  We had to change our bathing suits when we went swimming, and there'd be a couple Scout  Masters in there with the kids.  Oh, man.  Those were the gay guys.  And so there'd be the two guys with the giant hairy balls, and then all of us were like,  what the fuck is that?  Wait, they took their shit off, too? 
[01:15:00]  Yep.  Those are the gay guys.  Yeah.  Or the pedos.  Yeah, those are the pedos.  Or the pedos.  Fair enough.  Yep.  Fair enough.  Yeah, that is two different things.  It really is.  Some people get confused.  Yeah.  Those hairy balls are ingrained in my memory.  You...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  So...  Remember that?  When you had a shower?  Yeah, well, we go...  Hold on there, Eric.  I'm gonna get to you.  And hold on to Aaron, and hold on to John.  And three really good calls.  We'd go swimming once a month at a pool, and there'd be a locker room and everything. 
[01:15:30]  And you'd have to, yeah, shower and change out of your bathing suit in a locker room in  front of everybody.  And all the little...  You know, all of us, we were like fourth and fifth grade.  So we're trying to, you know, change under towels and stuff and hold them up and everything.  Oh, man.  And then there'd be the one or two scout leaders that would just be there.  Big hairy balls?  Towels couldn't be further away from them, somewhere on the floor.  That is just fucked up.  And their giant hairy balls just hanging out for all of us to see.  I think some of these pedos got away with murder when we were growing up. 
[01:16:00]  They didn't touch anyone there.  Because now everyone is suspicious and...  I guess they didn't touch me.  But they're on high alert now.  Back when we were growing up, they got away with murder.  They didn't touch you, because when your mother would pick you up from camp, she'd probably  pick you up by the legs and smell your crotch to make sure no one had been in there.  Oh, my God.  That's where you play frickle-frackle in the shower, where you put soap all over the  head and you slap them.  Right, you slap them.  I remember showering with my bathing suit on.  Then I would do the towel thing and pull my bathing suit off. 
[01:16:30]  No, they would...  I think they might have...  They might have been getting off on just being exposed around all those boys.  You know what I mean?  The biggest rods?  No.  Not that I remember.  Did you know as a little kid that it was just wrong?  It was hard.  Yeah, I remember like, what the fuck?  You did, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, this is not normal.  We all have our towels covering ourselves, and then there's these two guys that are just...  Just trying to show you that the body is beautiful and be men looking at each other.  Don't be ashamed, boys.  I bet they used to jack off.  You think so?  Thinking about you guys in the shower, yeah.  Trying to cover ourselves our own towels.  Trying to cover all innocent. 
[01:17:00]  Whoops, there goes the towel.  How old are Boy Scouts?  Whoops.  Not Cub Scouts, but how old...  Starts in sixth grade, right?  There's about 12.  Until you discover girls.  Until you're an Eagle Scout when you're 18.  But is it harder...  Let me ask you.  Like, say, you know, most gay guys are not pedophiles.  So say a guy who's gay, but who likes adult men.  Is it harder for him?  Like, if you're a 16-year-old teenager, and you're a Boy Scout, and you're in the woods,  is a gay guy who might want to fuck you? 
[01:17:30]  Like, as a man, if you're out with a bunch of teenage girls, it's going to be really hard  not to want to fuck him in the tent.  Because you're not...  You say you're a guy.  You're not a pedophile.  You don't like little girls.  But it's a girl who's 16, almost 17.  How do you not want to fuck him in the woods?  I see you give me the fucking eye.  That's what I'm saying.  But as a straight man in that situation, you're thinking things.  Yes.  You're absolutely thinking things.  Yeah.  So is it harder?  Is that why...  Do parents...  Would I worry about that if I was a parent?  I don't know.  I might.  We traveled with den mothers. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, okay.  I remember the den mothers.  They were weird, too.  They were called the cock blockers.  Fuck cock blockers.  Let's go to this guy who had to take his bathing suit off, too.  That is the weirdest fucking thing.  Comes up a lot on our show.  Eric, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hi, Iraq.  All right.  So I did not remember this at all until I got in my car and started listening  to the spit, so...  That means you were touched, probably, according to Jimmy.  What was his name?  Jimmy's flow chart.  Yes. 
[01:18:30]  It was in a sleepaway camp in Maryland.  I was probably like 12 or 13 years old, and there was just this big wooden box that  had 14 or 15 shower heads, and he used to just make his line in, and, you know, we're  all young kids, so we didn't want to take our bathing suits off, and we had our scout  businesses in there, probably like 60, 65 years old, and they would not let us leave  the shower until all of us took our bathing suits off, and whatever.  I'm scared to death, so I'm taking it off, but then you have the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts 
[01:19:00]  that were fighting the scout masses, like, no, we're not taking it off, and they just  started whipping us with towels until we would take our bathing suits off and make  our soap off ourselves.  You're not going to get clean with a bathing suit on.  And I would imagine if you're an older gay guy, that's just good enough.  You get to see, like, you know, boys turning into men fucking naked.  Young men.  That's crazy.  It was awful.  And then, like, I was telling my mother, and she was like, you're exaggerating.  It didn't actually happen.  Oh, nice.  Isn't that great when a parent won't listen? 
[01:19:30]  So what do you say?  Oh, my God.  So what do you do on Mother's Day?  Do you call up and go, hi, cunt?  I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday.  Hey, thanks.  I just sent her pictures from exactly what happened.  So, all right, guys.  Thanks, man.  Taking the bathing suits off, that's just a turn on for somebody.  You don't need to do that.  No.  I used to shower with my bathing suit on thinking, well, I'm getting the chlorine out of my dump  suit.  My mom was a den mother and, like, a class mom and all that.  And she told me later on, like, a couple years ago, the only reason she was so involved 
[01:20:00]  in all the school and all the, you know, Cub Scouts and all that stuff was because she  wanted to make sure that nobody was doing any of that.  Oh, man.  She wanted to make sure she was around as much as possible.  Yeah, good for her.  Because she thought you were attractive enough.  I don't think she was in touch.  She knew everybody wanted to put the dick in Sam.  Yeah.  I appreciate that compliment.  Oh, man.  Let's go to, uh...  Yeah, okay.  Aaron in Utah.  This one, I... 
[01:20:30]  Are you just saying this to be on the radio?  I have to ask.  No.  We went on these trips in December called the Klondike, where they would go and show  us how to make igloos and melt them right, and we'd sleep in them.  And then they would strip us down to our undies to show us how body heat would be a survival  mess.  Come on.  Come on.  I'm serious.  I'm serious.  It's not like your clothes were wet, you know?  And then you'd strip down to your undies and, like, show us that body heat would help you 
[01:21:00]  survive.  Wait, but would you lay together or just in the same place?  No, they'd give us two-man sleeping bags.  Two-man sleeping bags?  No.  Who makes that?  The Hargis sleeping bag company?  Sure.  You got...  It's like a side car.  You got one long end and one short end for the lad.  The little one.  Yeah, that's why you can't squirm around.  You get him in the cocoon, and you have, like, a little area where the flap opens, and  you can kind of poke him in his backside to wake him up. 
[01:21:30]  What the fuck is that?  There was always that lucky boy that got to go with the Scoutmaster.  Of course.  Oh, man.  Come on.  I don't know.  I wouldn't put it past these motherfuckers.  That's fucked up.  They called it the Klondike.  The Klondike.  Great.  Yeah, some gay guy came up with that one.  No, I shouldn't say that.  It's not fair.  Some fucking pedo.  Well, if you're...  Some fucking pedo came up with...  Let's start something called the Klondike.  Klondike.  They'll buy it. 
[01:22:00]  There's probably straight pedos and gay pedos, so in the Boyd County, it attracts gay pedos.  Yeah, yeah.  Whereas, like, regular schools and shit probably attract straight pedos.  Right.  I had a dumb line about Jerry Sandusky renaming the book Fifty Shades of Gay, and then people  got really mad at me, going, uh-uh, he's not gay, he's a pedo.  He could be a gay pedo.  You can be a gay pedo, though.  Yeah, if you only fuck boys, you're a gay pedo.  If you only fuck girls, you're a straight pedo.  You're a pedo first, though.  But in a way, I was educated a little bit.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  A little bit. 
[01:22:30]  They don't like gay being tied in with pedo probably mindlessly.  Just assuming that pedo means gay every time.  But I was confused by that.  Yeah.  What is the difference?  Pedos like children.  I mean, I think...  But someone like Sandusky, could he be a pedo and not a gay guy?  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, again, I don't know.  But he probably is a repressed homosexual, but, like, a pedo, too.  But it's possible to just be a pedo and not be gay if you're touching little boys?  No, I mean, if you're...  No, in his case.  I don't know.  That's where I'm confused by that. 
[01:23:00]  I would say no.  My guess, if you're a pedo and you're only fucking little girls, you're a pedophile.  But you're a straight pedophile.  Right.  There's a lot of pedophiles that only want to fuck girls.  And I guess a guy like Sandusky is a pedophile who apparently only fucked boys, so he's gay.  I mean, I think he's...  That's...  Well, a lot of good guys were tweeting me angrily saying he's not gay, he's a pedo.  But they're not, like, gay mindlessly tied into it. 
[01:23:30]  There maybe are pedos that just fuck anything young.  I don't know how that breaks down.  And it was never my fucking...  Thank God.  Thank God.  Oh, God.  I'll tell you.  I hated pedos.  I would always trash them.  And me and Russ Meneve, the comic, were talking.  And he phrased it somehow.  He goes, oh, I'm so glad I don't have that one.  And I'm like, that's a great way to put it.  Thank God I don't have that fucking sickness.  That one.  Oof.  I got most of them.  But God damn it.  That's one that skipped me. 
[01:24:00]  Thank God you don't have that demon.  You think you'd be in prison?  I just, I wouldn't even want to have to fight that.  Oh, my God.  I wouldn't even, like, I have such a visceral, I don't hate children, honestly.  What a great commercial to come on.  I look at kids sometimes, and I'm like, how the fuck does that turn anybody on?  It's annoying.  There's nothing sexy about them, with their dumb little trousers.  I just don't get it.  But I don't know how it breaks down.  Little trousers.  But if you're a pedo and you only fuck boys, then I think you're a gay pedo. 
[01:24:30]  If you only fuck girls, you're a straight pedo.  I think that's right for me.  I understand that.  Yeah.  But are there pedos that just fuck anything?  Then they're bipedos.  Right.  But they should be, I think the issue is being described as pedophiles, not just saying gay.  Well, absolutely.  Right.  But there is a way to break it down, because gay people can't say that Sandusky is not a gay pedophile,  because why, then, isn't he fucking all children? 
[01:25:00]  Why is he only fucking young boys, unless that's his preference?  Right.  Right.  And then someone, Mike in Jersey, we don't have time to go to you,  the body heat thing is a special forces.  It's not uncommon.  Yeah, but Boy Scouts don't need to learn that.  They're not special forces, yeah.  Believe me.  Some special forces going on in there.  Yeah.  I love.  If you're going to special forces, then you'll learn that shit.  Yeah, exactly.  You don't need to learn that in Boy Scouts.  Yeah, because if you try to put your, if you try to fucking, oh, goddammit, I forgot the reference. 
[01:25:30]  What happened there, Jimmy?  I was going to do a reference to the heat, the, fuck you, I couldn't quit you.  Oh, yeah.  You couldn't remember.  Brokeback Mountain.  Yeah.  I was way off.  Midnight Cowboy.  Oh, Jimmy.  Sorry, boo.  Let me say hi to John in Philly.  John.  Hey, sir.  Good evening.  Oh.  Yeah, so I was a Boy Scout, and I was just straight up molested by my Scoutmaster.  Damn.  Yeah, it was kind of messed up. 
[01:26:00]  How did it happen?  I had, like, a little kid crush on his sister, so I'd have, like, a little afternoon date with her.  Afterwards, we went back to her house.  I'm really nervous.  Wait, how old were you, and how old was she, and how old was the Scoutmaster?  I was about 13.  The girl was about the same age.  We both went to the same Mormon church.  This was in Southern California.  Yeah.  And he was probably late 20.  Oh, boy.  So we had a little date, like, walking around the neighborhood, and then afterwards got back to their house. 
[01:26:30]  The date was kind of over.  I was going to say goodbye and walk home, and a dude says to me, oh, you know, I've got, like, some new camping equipment, like some tents.  Do you want to come check them out?  They're in my bedroom.  Oh, boy.  He still lives at home, which, thinking back now, was kind of weird.  How old was he?  Did he say?  Late 20th, I guess.  Okay.  So I went back into his bedroom, and he's like, oh, look at my tent.  I'm like, oh, okay, tent, that's nice.  And he said, oh, why don't you hang out?  Want to play a game?  Oh, no.  And I kind of said, okay. 
[01:27:00]  He said, how about truth or dare?  Oh, no.  And I said, sure.  And he said, well, but, you know, when people play truth or dare, no one really wants to play truth.  So let's just play dare.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And he said, and, you know, to make it even more interesting, I'll just come up with a list.  I'll write down a list of bears that we can choose to play with each other.  His fucking game stinks.  It was the worst.  And they were things like, you know, touch butts, clean up, which was where you take a washcloth and get it wet and wash the other guys talk with it. 
[01:27:30]  One of them was, I forget what he called it on the list, but, you know, when you get your pants back from the dry cleaner and there's that cardboard tube on the hanger to keep your pants from getting a crease in them?  Yes.  You take that thing off of the hanger, put it in the other guy's asshole, and blow through it.  That is hilarious.  Thank you for giving us our next bit. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, E-Rod.  Great, a Chicago bit.  Right, we need a Chicago bit.  Oh, my God.  Why did you go into this guy's room?  I was taught to go along with a grown-up, say, and he was the scoutmaster.  That trusting thing, son of a bitch.  Oh, man.  Why did you leave his room when you realized, even in your young mind, that things weren't right?  Well, after I gave him a handjob, that's when I figured, this is getting weird. 
[01:28:30]  What dare was that called?  He called it buzz-off.  Buzz-off?  Buzz-off.  You buzz the other guy off.  Oh, my God.  Now, were you attracted to some of this shit in your young mind?  I didn't really understand what was going on.  I keep saying young minds.  It never occurred to me that I might be molested, and he did it kind of gradually over about 20 minutes. 
[01:29:00]  But, yeah, it didn't really occur.  It kind of sunk in after he, well, he wanted to be on the floor, and I had to kind of mount him, and that's when he did his buzz-off.  So he kind of came on my back.  Wait, wait, wait.  I don't even see how this works.  I do.  He's laying, the older gentleman's laying on his back.  You climb on.  Are you rubbing your asshole on his dick, like lap dancing him?  Um, I wasn't rubbing on him, but that's about where my ass was.  Oh, so he was humping your ass? 
[01:29:30]  Well, his cock was kind of right below my ass, and he was jerking off, and it landed on my ass.  Oh, he couldn't believe he was that close.  Oh, no.  He was feeling your penis pressed against his pubis.  Yeah, it was the closeness, I think, that did it for him.  And, yeah, then when he came on my back, that's what I said.  I think I needed it at home.  Did you ever?  The Boy Scout.  There's the dumb Boy Scout.  As this guy's telling his story.  Look at how ridiculous the guy looks in his Boy Scout shorts.  He's 70 years old. 
[01:30:00]  So did he do anything to you?  Um, he kind of just kind of tugged on me a little bit.  He never fucked me or anything, or made me blow him.  But he definitely touched me.  I got out of there.  Nothing ever happened again with this guy.  How long were you in contact with the guy after the fact?  Maybe a year.  I don't live anymore.  I don't live out there anymore.  I still have family out there, though.  He's still around.  He's married now. 
[01:30:30]  Why don't you knock on his door and go, hey, motherfucker, you want to come on my back again?  Well, a couple things.  Hold on, hold on, sir.  A couple things.  Nothing happened to this guy?  No one else caught him doing any shit?  No, he's still out there.  Okay, and how did this affect you as you grew up?  Um, I'm sure it has, but I'm not, I couldn't say how.  Maybe I hit the Boy Scouts.  Are you?  I'm not homophobic or anything.  I don't freak out like that.  Are you gay? 
[01:31:00]  No.  I'm getting a tweet now of someone saying pedos don't care if it's a boy or a girl.  It's the fact that there are kids that they like.  But I don't know how true that is.  I think that maybe for some of them it is, for bipedos, but there are pedophiles that  only fuck boys.  Yeah.  And there are pedophiles that only fuck little girls.  I think, just because, and I don't blame gays for not wanting to be lumped in as pedophiles,  because most of them are not, but just because they don't want to be lumped in, you can't,  you can't call something other than what it is. 
[01:31:30]  Right, right.  And you can still have an orientation and be a pedophile.  Sure.  Sure.  But there's, you know what I mean?  It's like, I don't believe that pedophiles just like anything under 10.  No, no.  I think he's Michael Jackson.  What about him?  Well, he, he, was he with boys and girls or just?  Boys, so boys only.  I don't even know if he was a pedo, to be honest with you.  I mean, I've got my, I've always thought he was, but then I'm like, I don't know.  He's just a fucking weirdo.  Yeah, let me, let me read this tweet from John Dad with two D's, J-O-N as well. 
[01:32:00]  Uh, you probably shouldn't link up someone being gay, which isn't wrong, with being a  pedo, which is very wrong.  I, you know, I get that a little bit now.  Or, or I get it more.  Not mindlessly link it, but if you're a pedo who only fucks boys.  Right.  Then you probably are a gay pedo.  Right.  You're gay and a pedophile.  Yeah.  Doesn't make, doesn't mean that every gay guy is a pedo.  Right.  I got you, John.  Because how many guys fuck little girls, uh, they're straight. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  You know, they're just pedos.  Yeah.  Maybe they say they want pedophile to be first.  You're a pedophile who's gay, or you're a pedophile who's straight.  Pedo being the first adjective.  Yeah.  But that to me is just almost a PC way of saying it, you know, it doesn't matter.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, John at Philly, thanks for sharing your story.  Jesus Christ.  I've never, never told that story before.  All right.  Are you damaged by that story?  Um, my hands are shaking a little bit. 
[01:33:00]  I'm a little nervous.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  Go jack off.  Yeah, bring it all back.  Do you feel ashamed?  Um, I wish that I figured out what was going on about 10 minutes earlier than I did.  It could have been worse, though, didn't it?  Yeah.  And how old are you?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, how old were you?  I was 13.  I was about 13.  I'm about 42 now.  Okay.  I wonder if there's going to be some big relief for you that you told your story.  Yeah, it could be.  Let us know down the road.  All right.  All right.  Watch if his girlfriend listens and dumps him, and then his family ostracizes him. 
[01:33:30]  I'm not playing buzz off with you, John.  Yeah, man.  Now, buzz off.  Thanks for calling, man.  Yeah, John.  Right on, man.  John of Philly.  Wow.  Yeah.  That makes me hate the Boy Scouts, and, you know, makes their argument.  You know, before we go to break, we got Ed.  He's a cop who just goes after pedophiles.  Let's say hi to Ed.  Ed.  Oh, hold on.  I hate Ed.  Gary?  Yeah, yeah, Ed.  I got you now. 
[01:34:00]  What's up, buddy?  All right.  Hey.  Yeah, I'm a cop in Jersey, and I do investigate all the pedophiles.  Pedophilia is actually like a psychiatric diagnosis.  Other than them being officially classified after being arrested, they're just kid-touchers prior to that.  What do you...  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it's a diagnosis.  Like, pedophilia is a diagnosis.  So let me ask you a question about pedophiles.  There are gay pedophiles.  Like, if a pedo only fucks boys, what would you classify him as? 
[01:34:30]  He's a homosexual pedophile.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, see.  But if he only fucks girls, he's a straight pedophile.  Right.  But there are, you know, predatory...  Well, I guess all pedophiles are predators.  But, you know, there's like opportunistic predators, pedophiles.  They'll go after whoever they can get their hands on.  You know, boys or girls.  But there is the distinction between heterosexual and homosexual.  Well, now let me ask you.  Now, the opportunistic ones, wouldn't they just be considered bisexual pedos? 
[01:35:00]  I guess they could be, but they're...  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know how else to try and clear that up.  You know what I mean?  I mean, hey, if you like boys and girls, you're bisexual, right?  Yeah, I mean, there's no way...  And, again, I understand why gays would not want to be...  Of course not want to...  Because they've been lumped in with pedos so unfairly so many times.  Right.  When there's so many fucking pedos that fuck little girls. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  But just because that's an unfair assumption,  it doesn't mean that you should say that a pedophile just fucks anything that's nine  because that's not the way it works.  Right.  Well, let me ask, Ed.  Are there more gay pedophiles or straight pedophiles?  Um, it's about 50-50.  There you go.  Oh, well...  There you go.  Well...  Uh, doctors...  Oh, what?  Sorry.  Uh, the pedophiles that are after that are opportunistic.  Um, these guys are attracted to the age and that innocence. 
[01:36:00]  They're not necessarily attracted to a sex.  Okay.  Now, when you would catch these guys, how satisfying was it to get to actually put the cuffs on one  of these guys?  Oh, it's fantastic.  What?  Um...  There's nothing more satisfying than making a grown man cry.  Do they, uh, bump their heads accidentally?  Yes, they...  There's a few break checks on the way to the...  Break checks.  So you found some, uh, you found some...  Did you find any that you hated more than others? 
[01:36:30]  Like, did you find that there were some that were creepy that just wanted to touch kids and  then there were the sadists?  Yeah, there's guys that are out there that really want to hurt them.  Into more of a, like, like a painful assault.  I just don't get it.  Oh, wow.  I just don't get it.  Um, I gotta sit.  Dr. Steve texted.  Uh, he goes, geez, I can't beat that story.  My counselor just took showers with us sporting a giant boner.  Is that true?  I don't know.  Yeah.  A guy... 
[01:37:00]  Dr. Steve, if that's true, call up, uh, for after the break.  A guy showering with a giant boner.  How frightening that would be.  You know what?  The water would leak down and would go under the crown and would drip into my mouth like  a hamster feeder.  I want to know how you explain that away.  Uh...  Showering with a big boner in front of other people.  Yeah, big rod.  All right, uh, Dr. Steve, hopefully after the break.  Ah...  Let's not forget Gary Oldman from Dark Knight.  Oh, yeah.  In about an hour, I think?  About that, yes. 
[01:37:30]  And then Mick Foley's after.  And then Mick Foley's stopping by to say hi, our old pal.  Oh, yeah.  All right, hold.  Just hit it, he rocked it.  This is the opening entry show of Sirius XM.  I want to thank somebody.  Oh.  And I'm going to stare at Anthony as I do this.  Uh-oh.  I want to thank Gene Simmons.  Whoa.  Gene Simmons.  I want to thank Gene Simmons right now. 
[01:38:00]  I'm trying to guess why.  Are you okay with this?  Well, uh, it depends.  Okay, fair enough.  What did he do?  I want to thank Gene Simmons.  Yes, this might be a surprise for a lot of O&A listeners.  Gene Simmons just tweeted a link and then says,  fund for a radio producer of the O&A show who passed unexpectedly leaving young wife and  it continues.  So, uh, I would imagine, uh, uh, young wife and, and son.  Oh. 
[01:38:30]  Did he tweet that?  Yes, he did, Jimmy.  Well, that is very nice.  Yes, he did.  That's why I didn't want you to go to the bathroom.  Oh, very nice.  Gene Simmons doing the right thing.  What was the rest of the tweet?  Because it looks like it.  Uh, fund for radio producer of the O&A show who passed unexpectedly leaving young wife and  child.  He just kind of retweeted.  That's, you know, all right, Gene.  Gene has a lot of followers and that really is going to move this, uh, Steve Carlesi memorial  fund.  We're up to almost $25,000, which is unbelievable.  I want to thank the listeners.  That's way more than we thought we'd get at this stage of the game. 
[01:39:00]  Great job.  Yes.  And MJ is beyond appreciative and wants to thank everybody who's, uh, who has given to the  fund and, and to the people who are just thinking of, uh, Steve and maybe, you know, can't give  to the fund because they got their own shit going on.  I'm retweeting Gene Simmons.  That was nice of you.  So am I.  So am I.  So am I.  I guess I will too, Gene.  So am I.  That's pretty, that's pretty decent of Gene, I must say.  Yeah, it is.  It's like, uh, maybe he's, he's at times not done the right thing, but I'll say in that 
[01:39:30]  one, when it, when it, that, when it really, uh, means something, he certainly did.  Yeah.  That Gene.  Yeah.  I, I, uh, just retweeted it.  All right, Gene.  I'm going to go pee.  Very cool.  Just in case you don't know how to spell it.  Can I retweet your tweet?  Uh.  I'll just retweet.  Let's all just retweet our tweets.  I'm retweeting this.  Let's just keep retweeting our tweets.  Retweet.  There.  I just retweeted.  That was very cool of Gene Simmons.  Very cool.  Very cool.  That's, uh, wow.  Thank you to Gene Simmons. 
[01:40:00]  And what are we up to?  Uh, 23 and a half.  23 and a half.  23 and a half.  23 and a half.  Nice.  Um, Anthony, I went to see The Dark Knight with Roland.  Yes.  And, uh, and Roland, his thing today is, you know, to do the Batman ears.  Bat ears.  And he did.  I don't know why he does it with, like, two fingers.  Like, he's doing it like, like, bunny ears.  Like, two sets of bunny ears.  Bunny ears, right.  Like, he's making two peace signs with his hands.  Yeah.  And putting them up by his head.  Yeah.  What is that? 
[01:40:30]  I'm not creative.  You can just do one, like, or something.  I don't know.  And he did to me, like, he's all in with this Dark Knight.  And I go, shut up, Roland.  You slept through half the movie.  Did he?  He he he he he he he he.  Did you sleep?  I cut the important parts.  And he, I swear to you, and I was too scared to fucking pull out my phone, because they watch  it like hawks at these things.  You laugh in your sleep.  What?  He laughs in his sleep.  You hear this laugh, which I love, by the way. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  I love trying to imitate it.  It's a very subtle version of it.  You hear?  No way.  And I'm looking over, like, but there's nothing funny in this movie.  And he is out cold.  He's leaning on the girl to his left, basically, that he sort of knows.  What's up?  What's up?  No, she was just being polite and didn't know how to wake you and move you.  How do you laugh?  How do you laugh during sleep like that?  What do you feel like?  It's like a dog chasing a rabbit. 
[01:41:30]  And I kept looking over.  I estimate you were asleep for half the movie.  Yeah.  What do you know about the Dark Knight?  I would love to know through your eyes, considering you saw maybe an hour and 20 of the two hours.  I can promise Warner Brothers does no spoilers coming from me.  Oh, he did keep waking up and goes to me, remember, no spoilers.  Oh, my God.  And then goes back to sleep with this weird little subtle laugh.  Remember, no spoilers. 
[01:42:00]  I'm like, you don't even know what's going on.  I woke up and I realized I was on top of her sleeping.  Jesus.  I know.  I'm sorry.  What do you know about the Dark Knight?  What did you see last night?  I saw the beginning with the awesome aerial view.  And then all of a sudden, Anne Hathaway was there.  So I was like, oh, Catwoman's finally there.  And then.  All of a sudden.  All of a sudden.  That was 20 minutes into the movie.  And then I saw Gary Oldman.  Hence the sleeping part.  That's why this is great.  Because then he wakes up. 
[01:42:30]  And what do you see when you wake up?  I woke up and then Gary Oldman, I go, oh, he's police commissioner.  And then something happens.  I'm like, I don't understand what's going on.  Yeah, you must have had no clue.  Jimmy, you missed her.  And then during dinner, she was telling me about it.  She said, yeah, I remember they do this and this.  I was like, I don't.  And then she goes, remember this and this happened.  And I can't remember nothing.  I went to the Dark Knight with Roland.  And he slept through half of it easily.  I fell asleep during it.  You fell asleep to it?  Yeah.  You were tired, though.  But Roland falls asleep and then he laughs in his sleep. 
[01:43:00]  Not like that over-the-top laugh that we love.  Very subtle and very softly, he laughs in his sleep.  Like that.  I bet you when Roland sleeps, he just thinks of being in a big padded soft room  and just being tickled with feathers and love.  Yes.  He's dreaming.  He's just thinking of people saying yes to guests.  Juggling.  Yeah, he's thinking he sends out an email and he goes,  this guy's going to be a big actor. 
[01:43:30]  And we all go, absolutely.  He immediately gets a response from everybody and it's yes.  Yes, yes.  He's all his favorite actors.  It's David Duchovny.  Oh, my God.  It's all his dreams.  I'm like Suits people, yes.  Yeah, the guys from Suits.  Yes.  He would wake up and he would lean over to me and go,  remember, no spoilers.  And then go back to sleep.  That was the weirdest thing.  Why do you go?  And then I remember...  Yeah, what do you remember?  There's a battle about, like, why are they fighting? 
[01:44:00]  Well, it's a Batman movie.  And then Joseph Gordon-Levitt character really confused me  until during dinner, she explained everything to me.  It's like, oh, that's awesome.  Who did?  Who?  Somebody that I took to the movie.  Oh, oh, oh.  But who confused you?  Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the character.  So I was like, what's going on with him?  And then I could understand it.  And then I see people at, like, parties happening.  The young police officer.  Oh.  I don't know what's going on with him.  I was like, why is he there?  Then she fell in.  He was good, that guy who played a cop.  He was really good, yeah, yeah.  I missed a big chunk of what happened with him. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  He used to be that child actor.  Yeah, he was on Third Rock.  Third Rock.  Yeah.  It's an inception.  And then he was in that movie, 50 Days of Summer, which I...  50 Days of Summer.  That's awesome.  Which I did like.  It was his little comeback movie.  And now they're using him a lot.  Yeah.  He actually was really good in it.  Yeah, I liked him.  Yeah.  Good chap.  Good chap.  You liked the movie?  Yeah.  What you saw?  Yeah.  How could he like the movie?  There's no liking the movie.  How could you like it?  You snored through the entire thing, you idiot.  You didn't see any of it. 
[01:45:00]  You thought I had sleep apnea.  Did you think Bane just had a sleep apnea mask on?  I didn't understand what was going on with him.  It's Bane Chippen or something, sis.  Oh, boy.  I'm Bane Chippen.  Bane Chippen, sis.  Bane Chippen.  I woke up.  He was attacking Batman.  What's up with that?  Sis, I was attacking Batman, sis, because I don't like bats, sis.  I like bat mitten, sis, sis. 
[01:45:30]  Fucking rolling rules.  You are a lot of fun, buddy.  Your slide video is doing well, by the way.  Yeah.  My leg still burns.  Does it really?  Yeah.  I put cream on there.  Let's go.  Oh, jeez.  I know.  The sound it makes.  Do we play the sound on our show?  I don't think so.  Do you play it really fast?  This is rolling going on a slide.  Listen to the sound.  Let me see it, Sam.  Oh, I just got fucking chills. 
[01:46:00]  I just got goosebumps.  Yeah, that's...  That's...  Oh, God damn, look.  That's a great video.  It's called...  It's cold.  That's like...  Ah, that freaks me out.  Yeah, but thank God for Eric's King Rockup.  It didn't hurt.  Eric, we put that on the Facebook page.  Ah.  Yeah, it's been up there.  You frammed into that slide.  It's hilarious.  Oh, my God.  I was trying to show his son.  Don't be scared.  This is how you do it.  At E-Rock's party, we took a break to take my son to the local playground, and Roland was a trooper. 
[01:46:30]  Show him the next scene, too.  Roland loves this slide.  It's cold.  And then, you know...  That was pretty much...  And then...  And there's a kid.  Oh, my God.  Roland on a swing.  And it's those swings that, like, for me to have to get into.  They're baby swings.  Yeah, for me.  So he's just sitting on it.  Roland's pants are halfway down his ass.  Yeah.  It's a wreck.  It turned out, all right.  It's called Roland Loves to Slide, if you want to check it out. 
[01:47:00]  There are a few hoodlums around, so they understood.  Hoodlums?  Yeah.  There were, right?  Yeah.  There was a little gang hanging out, man.  I was thinking about you.  What the fuck is that about?  I was thinking that maybe I could use what you got.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And Opie had to go to the bathroom instead of walking to Eric's house.  He used to pour your pot in.  I told you I could shit and pee anywhere.  I don't give a fuck.  It smelled in there bad.  Of course.  And there were Nazis.  Things are terrible.  There was, like, white power shit in there.  Was there some swastikas?  I almost Instagrammed that for your pleasure. 
[01:47:30]  For your pleasure.  Oh, no.  It was against the white power people because this playground was close to a thing.  Oh, I see.  My people.  Yeah.  A thing.  I gotcha.  Oh, yeah.  There were a lot of brown.  A lot of brown people.  You're making Anthony glad that you didn't go to this Nagel Fest.  Oh, man.  Where does Nagel live?  Nagel?  No.  No.  He's fine.  That's news to me because that's a pretty white neighborhood.  Yeah?  No.  You've been duped. 
[01:48:00]  No.  Nagel's house is fine.  The park was a bit of a walk from where he lives.  But we saw it on the way in.  I said, you know what?  I'm going to take a little break and give my kids some exercise.  And then Roland fucking made me howl with that.  Can you play the slide sound again?  You should isolate it and that should be the entire video.  You should fucking just tweet that out.  Him is going down.  Like.  I hate that.  Dude, that's fucking great.  Thanks. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, that one turned out all right.  Hey, we got Dr. Steve on the line here.  Dr. Steve, you used to shower with a guy that had a huge boner?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's what made me want to be a doctor because I didn't understand how to sew the little stitches  into my backside and I would bleed into my white sailor pants.  He'd make me wear white sailor pants and I'd say, sailor pants.  Oh, that would be adorable, Dr. Steve. 
[01:49:00]  I learned the definition of the word two-messence.  What is two-messence?  What is two-messence?  Oh, that's what, uh.  Is that what happens after you get one-messence?  Oh, God.  And that wrecked penis is two-messence.  Is it two-messence?  Yeah, that's the medical term for it.  Oh, that's, well, he penetrated me with his two-messence penis.  There you go.  Wow.  And he tore my anal lining.  Jesus.  So what happened?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, it was just, I went to this camp. 
[01:49:30]  This was not a Cub Scout camp.  This was before Boy Scouts.  I went to camp.  I was about nine, I guess.  And all I remember is we had to take showers and the counselors would take showers with us.  And there was this one counselor in there that I distinctly remember this.  He had this giant curved penis.  And I was thinking, God, is that how old, you know, when I get older, is my penis going to look like that?  Tastes like that? 
[01:50:00]  And it wasn't until much, much later that I looked back at that and realized the guy just had a giant rod.  Wow.  So he was fucking very excited to be showering.  Yeah, why?  Yes, apparently.  Who was he again?  I remember the water, you know, dripping off his glistening member.  Oh, man.  How old were you?  I was nine.  And why was he showering naked in front of you guys with a boner?  We were, it was camp. 
[01:50:30]  So, you know, it's shower time, kids.  Oh.  You just hit the showers.  Did anyone report his boner to anybody?  Just his boner.  Yes.  I didn't know, you know, this is the thing.  We were so little, I don't think any of us knew what it was.  We just thought that's what old person Dick looked like.  Wow.  Jesus.  You know?  Man.  And, yeah, I actually had, I wasn't molested that time, but I did have a male babysitter that tried to get me to suck his penis one. 
[01:51:00]  Wow.  Yep.  Just pulled it out and went, hey, hey, check this out.  And I'm like, well, that's weird.  And he said, come on, play with it.  Oh, no.  So what'd you do besides play with it?  No, I said, hell no.  I was smart enough to say that.  I was just too weird.  How old were you?  I didn't know my parents.  And I'm still thinking about looking this guy up because he's got to be about 65 now.  How old were you and how old was he?  I guess he was 16 and I was 8 or 9. 
[01:51:30]  It was around that same time.  I must have been quite tussleable.  Yeah, you were a little doll, I guess.  What if he ends up like where you work?  Would you maybe do one of those, you know, injections?  Oh, yes.  It's going to make you comfortable.  Yes, make him comfortable.  You might feel a little pressure on your head with a sledgehammer.  You were a little dish when you were young, weren't you?  Jesus Christ, they all were trying to seduce him.  Oh, man.  Dr. Steve. 
[01:52:00]  That's a good story.  That's fucked up.  That's where he got his taste for wine, too.  He would just ply him with some fucking alcohol.  That's how they make it.  He drips fucking like he squeezes grapes and it drips off an old crooked cock into a bedpan.  It's called old crooked cock.  Yeah.  Well, it's from the old vineyard of Bent.  I call it Bent, the Bent Vineyard.  Well, Bobby Kelly will kill me if I don't mention my podcast. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, yes.  I hear it's doing well there, sir.  Check us out on riotcast.com.  Well, I've descended to about where I need to be, right under Voss.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  We did really well, but I think iTunes looks at velocity, you know.  So in the beginning, we had a lot of people signing on, and now our audience has matured.  So, you know, I'm about where I deserve to be.  You're a hardworking guy, though, because I'm constantly seeing your tweets where it's like, 
[01:53:00]  hey, here's the number.  Hardworking.  No money.  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And SiriusXM owns my name and the names of the characters on my show.  I just realized that from looking at my contracts.  That's wonderful.  Holy fuck.  Come on.  How is that fair?  Your name is Steve.  Yeah, how is it fair that they own your name and your show without paying you?  That one would fly, but that's what my contract is.  No, I know.  And then you go, well, this isn't fair.  They go, well, you know, take it or leave it. 
[01:53:30]  Take it or leave it.  I wish that if I left it, they would try to sue me for my name or characters.  I have a girl that will tell you I was doing chip before I fucked her, before I was working here.  Exactly.  Don't even think about that shit.  You own none of it.  Oh, Dr. Steve, when are you coming back to New York to hang out for a beer or two?  Yeah, we were looking at August or September, so I just got to come up with a bit.  You know, ever since doing Tippy Tom's rectal exam, I think every bit we've had has paled in comparison. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, when you start out that big.  I don't know.  I like the tasting of the urine bit.  That was pretty good.  Yeah.  That was pretty good.  So we'll think of something.  Yeah, we could shower together.  It sounds like you were fun.  We could blow into each other's assholes with a tube.  We learned that one today.  Cardboard hanger tube.  From the dry cleaner.  Oh, my God.  We learn shit on this show every day.  Fuck.  Riotcast.com.  I got to feed the boys some breakfast.  Riotcast.com.  Good luck, buddy.  That's what you call it.  All right.  All right. 
[01:54:30]  Bye, Steve.  Thank you, doctor.  Going to feed the boys some breakfast, as they call it.  Yeah, that's what the guy did.  Somebody would get in the shower with Steve.  I'm going to go feed the boys, this young mustachioed nine-year-old.  This creepy nine-year-old mustachioed boy with a weird voice.  You know, I don't know if this is normal for us to be doing this.  I want to play with my Legos.  He's got, like, the deep voice, the mustache.  Yeah.  He's nine.  He's nine years old, talking about physics. 
[01:55:00]  Let me...  What was the word he used for erection?  Oh, um...  Me.  To must...  To me.  Uh...  Minis.  Yeah, yeah.  Not a true...  You have to be a good listener to answer that.  Uh...  Hey, you know, today is Chappaquiddick Day.  Uh...  I love Chappaquiddick Day.  Tumescent.  Tumescent, yeah.  Tumescent.  Thank you.  Tree clouds.  Yeah, tumescent.  43 years ago, Ted Kennedy did his thing and got away with it.  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  Plunging off the bridge with Mary Jo.  That was it, huh?  Yeah, and then what?  He walked back to his...  Oh, he's a scumbag.  He walked back to his place all wet and fucking back to the compound.  Yeah, but he couldn't go to the police.  Fuck that cocksucker.  Yeah.  He let someone die that night.  He was a...  Period.  Period.  Or he just let her lay there overnight.  She would have died, maybe, but what a piece of garbage he was.  Who knows?  Are you drowning in a river?  Oh.  The point is...  Mary Jo.  What was her last name? 
[01:56:00]  Smell this water.  The car went off and to the right.  Off and to the right into the water.  Oh, Mary Jo.  Won't you...  Go, glug, glug.  Mary Jo.  Won't I get a hold of my head as retribution?  God will pay me back.  What a cock.  I've read the account of that where he just went back to his room and went to bed.  Left a girl in the water overnight because he said he was dazed.  What a piece of shit. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, he never gave her a chance, is the point here.  Who knows?  Maybe she did have a chance to survive if he did something.  But you see how he kept getting elected after that.  I know.  They wanted a Kennedy so bad in Boston.  People just forget about that shit.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, everybody that's bitching about things like Bain Capital and stuff like that, it's  like, really?  You fucking kept voting in a guy that killed a woman?  Yeah.  A woman also voted in Mitt, so...  Yeah.  Oh, are you breathing any water? 
[01:57:00]  Mary Jo, whatever the fuck your name is.  Capekney.  Capekney.  Yeah, I guess he was apparently drinking that night, too.  Whatever it was, it was complete piggish self-interest.  I'm glad it cost him a shot at the presidency.  He knew he couldn't run.  He still had a great career after that.  Oh, sure he did.  But he got what he deserved. 
[01:57:30]  A fucking drill in his head.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  All those Kennedys ended up in holes in their head.  They really did.  In the long run.  A Kennedy head just couldn't make it.  They love holes.  But technically, he didn't get...  I mean, he lived a long life.  He was in his 70s, right?  At that point?  Yeah.  I think Robert Kennedy was...  I mean, of them, I think Robert Kennedy was probably the best of them.  I mean, we all loved JFK.  You liked Bobby.  Yeah, I mean...  Bobby!  They all fought for civil rights, but I think that he was the most dedicated to it. 
[01:58:00]  And he bucked Hoover.  I love Negroes.  Oh!  Yeah.  Robert Kennedy.  Do you like their darker skin?  Robert Kennedy.  Oh, Bobby Kennedy.  Why don't we walk through the kitchen?  Bobby Kennedy.  Would you like to stop and look at the saran wrap?  Bobby Kennedy.  He was a man with two names the same.  Oh, Bobby Kennedy.  He's not asking you for an autograph, you dope.  His head went down into the floor. 
[01:58:30]  Down into the floor.  Oh, the last thing you see is busboy shoes.  Poor Bobby Kennedy.  Look at his black socks and his black Reeboks.  Oh, Bobby Kennedy.  Oh, God.  What a terrible shooting that was.  The fact that Sirhan Sirhan is alive, he really should just be fucking...  I think he's crazy.  Like, I've heard he refers to himself in the third person. 
[01:59:00]  Does he?  With that name, I would too.  Yeah.  But I think Robert Ressler or somebody interviewed him.  Or it might have been John Douglas, one of those FBI profilers.  Sirhan Sirhan likes you.  Sirhan Sirhan thinks you're hot.  He's a real piece of shit.  Jimmy.  Sign phone.  See, I just didn't know that one.  Fuck.  Jimmy likes you.  I think we've got to play Mimi Beardsley now.  Is it overplayed or...  Fuck it.  Let's do this.  Yeah.  Let's do this.  He rock.  Gary Oldman on the way.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley. 
[01:59:30]  Could you eat my ass?  Mimi Beardsley.  Haven't you done this before?  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, my dick smells like Mimi Beardsley.  Could you eat my ass?  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Are you fucking any Negroes? 
[02:00:00]  Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, do you have any friends who'll eat my ass?  Have some pool-legged alcohol.  Oh, you're a virgin, aren't you?  Smell the upper?  Smell the upper.  Her name is horrible.  It's a real cock softener.  Why don't you take care of my baby rubber?  Oh, his cock went back into the left.  Back into the left.  His cock went back into the left.  Back into the left.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley. 
[02:00:30]  Mimi Beardsley.  Could you eat my ass?  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Haven't you done this before?  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.

Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley. Could you eat my ass? Mimi Beardsley. Haven't you done this before? Mimi Beardsley. Worst name ever. Mimi Beardsley. Mimi Beardsley. Oh, Mimi Beardsley. Oh, my dick smells like Mimi Beardsley. Could you eat my ass? Mimi Beardsley. 
[02:01:30]  Worst name ever. Mimi Beardsley. Mimi Beardsley. Oh, Mimi Beardsley. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley.  Ah, we're discussing Chicago during the break here. 
[02:03:00]  Chicago.  If you don't know, Opie and I.  Opie and I, Jesus.  Opie and Anthony.  I got excited there.  Sorry.  Opie and Anthony live in Chicago, Friday, August 10th, 115 Bourbon Street.  That is in Marionette Park, just outside of Chicago.  The locals know where that is.  The broadcast, we work anything out with that? 
[02:03:30]  Are we still going from 4 to 410?  No, hopefully we can start at 3.  Because, again, that's 4 o'clock here.  I think we should go and, obviously, maybe have someone do a few minutes.  But, of course, Sam's great.  They're saying doors a lot.  We should literally be just – doors have to open sooner.  They have to open earlier.  Yeah, so the detail's a bit sketchy.  But that Friday, August 10th, get out of work early.  We're hoping to get the doors open by 2-ish.  Hoping to do that now. 
[02:04:00]  If you want the doors open at 2, so then you want Sam to start at 2.30?  Oh, no, there's a whole Sam thing that's not going to be part of this now.  Oh, good.  I'm so glad you weren't part of that conversation.  Sam will be there.  Oh, man.  Why would you not?  I'm just saying, why wouldn't they tell you that we discussed a lot of this in the hall yesterday?  Oh, yeah, no, nobody told me anything.  You're out of time.  We're trying to extend our time on the air.  Yeah, I know that.  So Sam might not be doing a pre-show.  I think that's a good idea.  Or he might do it earlier now.  So it's a bit confusing.  But I know this much.  We definitely will be broadcasting live in Chicago. 
[02:04:30]  The first fucking time we've ever done our show in Chicago.  We have no idea.  You know how I said earlier, taking chances?  We're taking a chance here.  Huge chance.  We're taking a huge chance.  We have no idea.  But we're assuming people will come from a whole bunch of different places.  You know what?  I don't care.  I'm going to go.  And I'm going to have a good time.  That's right.  So I don't fucking care.  What if a big crowd, no crowd, don't matter?  I think we're going to get a nice crowd.  I think we're going to get a really nice crowd.  Chicago's a fun...  Dude, I'm actually psyched because I love Chicago.  It's a fun city. 
[02:05:00]  Never been.  It's a fucking...  Don't they call it fun city?  I call it fun city, but I don't even say it like that.  I say, where are you going?  I say, I'm going to Chicago.  It's fun city.  Oh, shit.  I clap and I lean in.  That is good.  It's a really cool place, though.  Why don't we do this?  Facebook will have all the details as we update them.  Oh, yeah.  Make sure you're available Friday, August 10th for the big Opie and Anthony live show in  Chicago, please.  Yes.  115 Bourbon Street, Marionette Park there.  All right.  Yeah.  What kind of bits are we doing? 
[02:05:30]  We're discussing...  We're discussing something.  I don't think we should say it yet.  We shouldn't say what we were discussing.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  I guess you're right.  Okay.  All right.  What other bits are we...  Are we going to try to do the pig races with hot girls?  If you want to do them.  Sure.  Well, we start...  We got to kind of...  Well, I sent you guys a big list.  You should...  I know.  That's true.  But we need to start asking...  Can you print it out?  I can...  Sure, I can print it out.  Print it out and just give them to us.  We'll look at...  It's a lot easier to look at that.  Yeah, let's look at it right now.  You want to do it right now?  Yeah, why not?  All right.  I want to...  Go print it.  We got to get the word out to the big fat messes out there to help us out with our pig 
[02:06:00]  race.  Yeah, go print it, bitch.  Motherfucker.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  You think we can get four big women for our pig race?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If we can get four women, rest assured, they'll be fat.  And we could cover up your identity, even.  Yes.  Yeah, we can.  We just need you on all fours, like, doing a little pig race like you see at the State  Fair.  Yep.  And then we're going to do it with Hot Girls. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  The Hot Girls, that'll be easy, right?  Who was it that brought?  Was it Pat Duffy who had that pig mask with the hat on top?  Remember when we were doing Fatty Pig Fatty and if you wanted to conceal your identity,  we had a pig mask to put on?  And you know what?  The women were such good sports when we brought Fatty Pig Fatty around the country for a while.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  Yeah.  Who came up with that name?  Fatty Pig Fatty.  Was it you, Jimmy?  I did it proudly.  James.  We were trying to come up with the name for this contest to see the fattest woman for 
[02:07:00]  the newer listeners.  And Jimmy goes, let's call it Fatty Pig Fatty.  And then we would weigh fat girls on a stage and they ruled.  They were awesome about it.  And then what, we gave them a dollar a pound or something?  I think it was more than that.  Yeah, probably it was, right?  Ten dollars a pound.  Was it ten dollars a pound?  I think so.  That'd be into the thousands.  Yeah.  That's good.  Into the four thousands, I do believe. 
[02:07:30]  I think we got a couple of large ones.  That would actually be cool if we said the biggest, we'll give you ten dollars a pound,  the biggest pig that shows up.  Right.  I loved Fatty Pig Fatty.  Who didn't?  I think everyone loved it.  Fucking great.  I remember the women that were proud.  I think it was Cleveland.  Remember the, it was a virus show in Cleveland.  Remember that weird place we did?  Yeah.  It was kind of outdoors with a top on.  It was a weird, it was almost like a tent.  Did we do it live?  Oh yeah, we did.  I got pictures, I gotta find them. 
[02:08:00]  And we, we didn't have contestants ahead of time.  We started like, we had a solicit.  Yeah, we were doing some barking on the stage.  Some barking.  And all of a sudden, women, proud of their fatness, would raise their hands like, I'll  do it.  And then they just marched up the aisle and came on stage.  Yeah.  It was great.  Is that Dr. Laura?  Who?  Ingram.  Which one?  Where?  I don't know.  Well, that's different.  That's Barack Obama.  Yeah, it's the president.  That's the president.  Dr. Laura's different.  She's an old cunt.  I was going to say, what the fuck did she do?  Because she looked, yeah, that chick looks really nice. 
[02:08:30]  Who, her?  That's Laura Ingram?  Yeah, she's beautiful.  That's Laura Ingram.  Laura Ingram is not Dr. Laura.  They're different people.  Laura Schlesinger is Dr. Laura.  Oh, right, okay.  Dr. Laura Schlesinger.  Right, okay.  Go on and take on your day.  Nice cunt photos.  I got Laura Ingram.  Yeah, she's hotter than, what's her name?  The other blonde.  Oh, fuck yeah.  That to me is one of the greatest stunts Stern ever pulled off was getting that fucking rotten  bitch's naked photos online.  Oh, I hate her.  Travis, let's see the biggest. 
[02:09:00]  Big hairy twat.  Yeah, she sucks.  And then she lied at first.  Yes.  Fucking liar.  Liar, liar.  Your pants are off.  I think cunt on fire.  I think she works for the company.  She does.  How did that work out for you, Sirius XA?  I never see her.  I haven't heard a word about her show since moving over to here.  Nine.  And I'm sure they, whatever.  I like this.  Yeah, what do you got?  All the oddest thing.  We're doing that.  Yeah, if you want the oddest thing.  Yeah, that one we're definitely doing.  How, do we have production that is promoting this?  We got a heavy promote now. 
[02:09:30]  We have production that's promoting the event.  We're definitely doing the first one.  We don't have any production that's promoting specific bits because we have to decide.  Because we need people to come down with the oddest thing they own.  Kind of doing sort of a Pawn Stars thing.  Pawn Stars.  We'll ask, you know, if you want to sell it or pawn it.  And then we'll give you a horrible amount of money for it.  Basically, the person that brings the oddest thing to the broadcast will win $1,000.  Yeah, well.  So it's a quick $1,000.  It might be something small you could just throw in your pocket. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  Drink a few beers.  We're going to ask for the odd things.  And then the people come up on stage and we'll give somebody $1,000.  We'll pitch about how we have to frame it, hang it on the wall.  It's going to stay in my shop for a long time.  It's a specialty item.  It's a specialty item.  No one's really collecting these anymore.  If it had an A on it instead of a B, it would be worth ten times more.  You know.  Oh, my God.  That show.  I like the Windy City Challenge.  I'm telling you, we got a good idea.  That's not a guarantee, though.  We got to make sure someone is gassy that day. 
[02:10:30]  Do it.  I don't know about that one.  Jackass did it.  Did they?  Yeah.  The fart mask?  Yeah.  We've done it on this show.  Yeah.  I didn't even know they did it.  Yeah.  They've done it.  I've seen that done before.  Believe me, I love the idea.  I love the fart mask.  It's hilarious.  Oh, God.  The hummus or tongue scrapings.  Come on.  That I love, by the way.  Jesus Christ.  That's disgusting.  I don't think that would be fun.  The company wouldn't allow it.  No.  Or would they?  That's not necessarily true. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, good.  It's being investigated.  Okay.  That means no.  Okay, so we'll scratch that off the bar.  Not necessarily.  Wait, tongue scraping?  Hold on.  I'm fucking...  They're not going to listen.  Scraping, tongue smell.  This one they may like.  Smelling they'll allow.  That's what they're going to come back and tell you.  Smelling they'll allow, but see how it's written here.  We want people to taste.  Yeah.  Taste a chip that's...  What's that?  A chip covered with either hummus or tongue scraping.  And it's definitely not yet a no.  There are certain things that we have to figure out. 
[02:11:30]  Fair enough.  I'll try to...  Because I have an idea.  Open my mind slightly.  How about this?  Ever so slightly.  We have a contest who can hold something to do with a tongue scraping mustache.  Oh!  You make...  She's a big girl.  Oh, my God.  She's a big girl.  You make somebody wear a mustache of tongue scraping.  Oh, oh, oh, yeah.  It's disgusting.  I'm visualizing what he's saying.  Why didn't I bring in JFK to get Gary Oldman to sign it?  You should have.  I'm so dumb.  Oh.  I got Sutherland and Costner on it.  You didn't get Wayne Knight? 
[02:12:00]  Wayne Knight?  No, he's not big enough in JFK.  Yeah, he is.  In JFK, no.  He's got a pretty good part.  Pretty big part.  You wouldn't want him to sign it?  No, Oldman.  I didn't want him to sign it.  Oh, man.  Oldman would have been great.  I'm sure Oldman will come back for a third time.  No, he will, actually.  I think he had a good time for a second.  He really did have a good time.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll see Oldman again.  All right.  So, let's see.  Okay, the other one we don't want to say.  Yeah, you don't want to talk about that.  I think we're going to do that.  The pig race thing.  So, can we put this in a production piece and see if women are willing to sign up for this? 
[02:12:30]  And we've got to overbook.  Well, yeah.  Two women.  We want four women.  You want four?  Yeah, if it turns out it's two women, that's fine.  Okay.  Because they always bail on us.  I hate that.  And that's the one thing that worries me is that we're going to put together a lot of time and effort for something that we have to rely on.  Right.  Well, put it in a production piece.  See if the women come forward.  Even if they do come forward.  We've seen them just not show up.  I know.  We've got to take chances.  I'm just saying.  Yeah, no, I know.  Pig races.  We want big women to compete. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, we need at least $1,000 to $2,000 for a cash.  Don't you think?  For a cash prize.  Right.  I mean, that's what I'm thinking.  The company's not going to give us any of this shit, right?  That's not true.  You underestimate.  I'm going to ask you.  Well, what if we can also do the dollar, a dollar a pound, not $10 a pound?  Because no one will do it for $400 or $500.  But then you also get to compete in a pig race where you can win $2,000 or $2,500 or whatever.  That way, you get a couple hundred bucks just for showing up, so they actually will show up.  Well, let's ask the audience. 
[02:13:30]  Are there some fat pigs out there that want?  See, this is why I worry.  I have an idea.  Let's ask the audience.  Hey, fat pigs, you're willing to do this for us?  Jimmy, yes.  We have listeners do chip off the old block.  Oh, no.  And then audience members come up and do their best impression of chip.  And they have to pick a look.  Because I don't know what chip should look like.  I really don't, because I get recognized too much when I do chip, like as Jim.  I love it.  So chip off the old block. 
[02:14:00]  Whoever comes up with the idea, the best look for chip and sound, we'll have to decide which is which.  It's a small prize, but it'll be funny for the audience.  You come up and do an impression of chip.  Maybe we have two categories, the best impression and look.  That is the overall.  The best overall chip.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to say that.  Yeah, I want to say that.  Because if his costume isn't as good, but he's got the impression down, then, you know, as judges, we'll figure it all out.  Yeah, we can replace the last thing on the list with chip off the old block.  Because I want to see fucking, I want to see what people think chip should look like with a bad chip.  And the judge should be chip. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Something like that.  Right.  Yeah, none of them will be as good as me, but.  Right, exactly.  You know.  You're great, chip.  But you don't give a fuck anyway.  All right.  We got, I don't give, we, uh, all right, we got some good ones.  We got to get a production piece to start promoting this so we could hopefully get some,  um, some people involved.  The chip off the old block and, uh, the pig thing.  Let's roll with those two.  Do you think you're funny is a lot like car crash comedy.  Yeah, but, but, but not as structured.  What you, there might be something there with, do you think you're funny? 
[02:15:00]  Like, we've done it before and then it always just devolves into racism.  That's fine.  Hey, people can do racism.  We've done it in the heart.  It certainly does.  I think we have enough going on where we don't have to do that one.  Yeah, well, I mean, that's why there's, you know.  Because the chip thing is going to be funny.  Because they're going to come up with their silly stuff.  Right.  What else can we do besides a hum?  I like, I love the idea of a fucking tongue scraping mustache.  We're definitely doing something with tongue scrapings.  Definitely.  Because even just smelling it is brutal. 
[02:15:30]  Smelling it's terrible.  All right, how about that one?  I'm having to eat.  And Jimmy, make sure you come on your belly button before the Chicago trip.  We might need that as well.  And during it, believe me.  And maybe we could do something with, I can't believe I didn't print JFK.  Wow.  What?  I'm so mad at myself.  What time is Oldman here?  Ten minutes.  Too late to even go get it.  He's already here.  He's doing something else.  He's already here.  Hey, twist it.  You don't have enough time.  No.  I'll never make it back to my apartment. 
[02:16:00]  No, I don't think so.  You're not happy?  I'm very mad.  Oh, whatever.  Oh, Jimmy.  Is this going to wreck the Gary Oldman interview?  No.  Are you going to be obsessing about the JFK?  No, I should shut up.  I heard a guy.  I'm just annoyed.  But again, I have an idea for the tongue scrapings.  Who could we get to?  Maybe we could get.  I have an idea.  He's writing it down right now. 
[02:16:30]  What is he writing?  Yes.  I would love to have a worst breath contest, which is disgusting.  Yeah.  And maybe we have, you know.  Do you have someone in mind?  No, no, not necessarily the show.  A ringer?  From the audience.  Yeah.  Well, we need someone to smell it.  Well, Iraq.  Yeah. 
[02:17:00]  Iraq will smell the air.  Oh, Iraq is great for that.  Iraq, that's your job in Chicago.  You're going to smell bad breath.  And there's a cool toothpaste, which I actually use.  It's hard to find toothpaste that is like.  Yeah, but the beauty of this contest, because it's not like we're pointing and laughing at  the individual, because they can make their breath really bad for you.  Yeah, anyone can make their breath bad.  But maybe we could get, I know, a toothpaste thing that I like, actually.  Maybe we can get them to sponsor it or something and give a big package of their stuff away.  Because it's actually great stuff, which I use.  Oh, you want to do good, do you?  Look at that.  Look at Jimmy wanting to do good. 
[02:17:30]  No, but I mean, make it, you know, it'll be a prize or something.  Yeah.  For the worst breath that Iraq will be smelling.  Determined by Eric.  Yeah.  That's official.  Put that in the production piece.  Eric.  Smelling breath.  Eric will be judging Chicago bad breaths.  But you have to give people a reason to want to come up.  Well, that's, you know.  You need a cash prize.  I think worse, I think making Eric smell bad breath isn't as a, you don't have to entice  them as much because, you know.  Yeah, they just want to see Eric's stuff. 
[02:18:00]  Like you guys said, you don't have to have inherently bad breath to make bad breath, you  know?  So it's not like an embarrassing thing.  I want inherently bad, like plaque breath.  Plaque.  Like fucking tartar breath.  Not like food that you ate that, you know.  Oh, I think you have to keep it open.  Oh, of course.  Just because.  I mean, I.  Just so we get contestants.  Oh, yeah.  Hell yeah.  But I agree with Jimmy.  But it's always better when it's something medical.  Of course.  I agree with that.  Yeah.  You want people with dead teeth.  Yeah.  Yeah, like a rotted tooth.  Or a fucking throat infection. 
[02:18:30]  Something really good.  Dude, I fucking had a beautiful girl walk by me recently and she like let out her breath  and she had flu breath.  And I got sick two days later.  I'm like, that fucking sickening monster breathes flu breath in my face.  Hope she's dead.  Nice fucking, nice flu breath typhoid Mary.  Wow.  Fuck.  Nice.  Yeah, this is shaping up to be a good one. 
[02:19:00]  I told you we have good ideas.  This will be fun fun.  Yeah, chip off.  Chip off the old block.  I like chip off the old block.  Do you?  Yeah, of course I do.  I can't get enough chip.  All right, so put a bunch of this in production pieces so we start getting people.  Chip.  Oddest thing you own.  Yep.  Bad breath.  Bad breath.  Bad breath.  Bad breath.  Bad breath will smell.  Keep it at that for now.  Okay.  Until we figure out the scrapings thing if that's going to work.  And pig races.  Well, we'll do a separate solicit for pig races.  All right, good deal.  Let's see how it goes.  All right.  Wow, it's going to be a good broadcast.  Friday, August 10th. 
[02:19:30]  We're actually planning this one.  Cleveland, we made it up as we went.  Well.  Not really.  We had a couple things in mind.  But it looks like we have more in mind for Chicago.  115 Bourbon Street, Friday, August 10th.  The start time, we're working with that right now.  But somewhere around two or three.  Keep your afternoon open.  Somewhere around two or three, I would get your ass to 115 Bourbon Street.  Yeah.  Marionette Park.  Yeah.  We'll keep updating the details on our Facebook page.  Opie and Anthony, one word.  Where's Gary Oldman, man? 
[02:20:00]  Word.  He's a very big star.  He's a very big star.  Penn State.  He's allowed.  To address the statue.  Yeah.  A lot of people were wondering if we were flying that banner yesterday.  And I'm sad to say no.  Who was?  Do we know?  No.  Banner basically said, take it down or we will.  Yes.  And it's flying over the Joe Paterno statue there.  They're going to keep it.  The statue?  Yeah.  I don't know about that. 
[02:20:30]  I think eventually it's going to come down.  I think eventually it might come down, but right now I don't think it's going to be  My thought is they want the statue to be gone, but they want the people to take it.  Because they're still defending their fucking university there.  And the students renamed Paternoville.  Oh, the students did?  Yeah.  Well, because that's just like an unofficial type name for where they...  I think the easiest solution is if the people took the statue, then Penn State, you  know, go, ah, what are you going to do?  They took the statue. 
[02:21:00]  Paterno is like, you know, look, what he did was great for Penn State, but the fact  that he sat on this for 10...  Fuck him.  Seriously.  Yeah.  It's a sport.  It's obvious now that he was a...  Let's see what the Paterno investigation uncovered.  Oh, the family.  Yeah, I'd love to see what that...  The family's investigation.  I'm sure it'll implicate Joe.  And what was the other thing about Penn State?  The NCAA, right?  Yeah.  Do you think anything will happen with that?  No.  They'll suspend the team? 
[02:21:30]  I don't think so.  Or the programmers.  It's how embarrassing to, like, be on the team now.  Yeah.  Yeah, it really is disgraceful.  Kid fucker team.  It wouldn't surprise me if they suspended it for a year, though.  I don't think they will.  Because that went to the top, dude.  The president.  Yeah.  That wasn't just, like, a rogue coach.  No.  It was the head coach.  It was the fucking president of the universe.  Yeah, but the thing with that is that they, I think they have to, like, you know, find that they violated NCAA rules.  Right.  I'm sure they can find a way.  There's one thing they did with a code of ethics where they don't report boy fucking. 
[02:22:00]  I mean, Penn State interim president Rodney Erickson says the school will respond to the NCAA's demand for information regarding the university's role in the Jerry Sandusky scandal.  So they want answers.  That could happen.  They want answers.  So maybe they do suspend the program just to come.  I don't know.  Oh, man.  They wouldn't do that, would they?  Who's that?  The hell?  Probably the guys publicist.  How much time do we have until he comes in?  A couple minutes.  Like a hole or something.  You should pee now. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah?  Do we have more than a minute?  You should pee.  I would.  Has he checked in?  Oh, yeah.  He's doing another interview.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, where's his last interview?  Oh, who's he interviewing with right now?  I think he's with Morning Mashup or?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Morning Mashup.  What are they talking about?  Nothing that we're going to talk about.  Oh, my God.  Of course nothing.  So you're in Batman.  So what's it like?  What's that like?  Fun?  Those quick three-minute interviews.  Tell us about. 
[02:23:00]  Tell us about it.  What's your favorite song?  We'll play it for you now, Gary.  And then they've got to go into a song.  Right.  As long as it's in their rotation.  The interview's not even live?  They did Gaga.  What?  Sam knows.  What?  Sam.  Sam.  They're taping the interview as the music goes so they can edit it down to something quick?  No, they don't do live interviews.  They'll go like.  They don't do live interviews?  Almost never.  Why?  They did one with the situation.  I think that was just a coincidence.  Hey, the situation's in here.  And then they went right to break.  They did Gaga live, right? 
[02:23:30]  I don't know if they did or not.  Do they panic?  What's the problem with doing live interviews?  It's about the music, Opie.  It's all about the music.  It has to be like.  Yeah.  They've got to put beds under.  So like literally, they'll get him in.  They'll interview the tape.  They'll get him in an interview with him.  But then on Friday, when they're doing box office biggies.  Yuck.  Stan will be like.  I mean, that sounds good.  What's a box office biggie?  Box office biggies.  That's how Stan says it.  Don't ever do that.  Stanley's miserable, huh?  And Stan does a box office biggies. 
[02:24:00]  Why can't we get him on Shade 45 and blow up that whole show?  Rich does flat screen favorites.  What?  Oh, does it have to always say TV?  Mikey Piff does the web watchers.  Not everyone has a flat screen.  What's web watchers?  The viral video of the week.  Oh, God.  The fuck is that?  What does the other one do?  What does Nicole do?  Nicole does the 411.  Oh, right, right, right, right, right.  Which is, I guess, information.  It's a daily thing, right?  Yeah, that's every day.  So she gets daily, everyone else gets weekly.  Right. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, but she's just reading TMZ.  That's very interesting.  When was the last time anyone dialed 411?  I mean, calling it the 411.  I think that's something else that left with my generation, because I remember dialing 411.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, though, no one uses 411.  He's on his way?  I actually think I already got on the sign, JFK.  I'm just thinking about it.  Oh, my God.  I believe I did, yeah.  I would think you did, too.  For sure.  It's kind of crazy.  Oh, you know what?  I think somebody went out and bought it for you when he was in last. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, no, that was somebody else.  For Sutherland?  Yes.  For Sutherland.  We bought you JFK.  But I might have brought that in anyway.  When?  I don't remember.  For Oldman?  Camera's on.  Camera's turning on.  Gary Oldman's coming.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He's a very nice guy.  Gary Oldman.  There he is.  Look at him.  Gary Oldman.  Dapper guy.  You can come right in, sir.  I'm right in, Gary Oldman.  One of our favorites. 
[02:25:30]  How you been?  Hello.  How you been?  How you doing?  Take a seat.  We're on the air, too, sir.  Yeah, we're always on the air.  How are you, sir?  Oh, yeah.  We just popped right on.  I came back.  Gary Oldman came back.  We weren't sure you would.  I was very excited about that.  I was locked in a cupboard.  I couldn't get out.  I'm very excited when you guys come back.  I'm looking going, this is the guy.  I just saw you yesterday in Batman.  Batman.  On the big, big, big screen.  On the giant screen.  Man, does that look amazing on IMAX.  Yeah.  It's just huge, vast. 
[02:26:00]  You're just looking in that screen, and the action is amazing on a screen like that.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  I didn't realize, by the way, Anthony pointed out that it's shot in letterbox and full.  I think that's how Kubrick did Strangelove was two different aspects.  Yeah, it's like two different aspects when you, with some of the, I guess, more dramatic  moments.  It's letterbox during dialogue and stuff, and then the action sequences, it goes to that  full screen.  Yeah, it goes to IMAX.  Yeah.  It's just amazing. 
[02:26:30]  And it goes between a sort of regular 35 to the IMAX.  And the transition between the two, I think, is pretty seamless.  It is.  You really don't notice.  As a matter of fact...  We didn't notice.  I had to point it out.  I didn't notice that it was even happening, that it was letterbox and then that opening  sequence to the movie on IMAX.  It's amazing.  You feel like you're up there with those aircraft.  They were up there.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:27:00]  That...  That's the difference, you see.  That wasn't CGI.  Well, that's why you, that's why you feel that.  Amazing.  Because he uses a lot of...  How do they film that?  He uses a lot of, in-camera.  Yeah.  Stunts.  It looked stunning.  I mean, in The Dark Knight, for instance, in the last one, you know, he flips that truck,  that huge truck that kind of goes up, and it looks like a sort of skyscraper.  Yeah.  And then it's upside down.  I mean, that's a truck flipping.  Yeah.  That's not a special effect. 
[02:27:30]  So, Chris is, he feels that there's too much digital stuff that overtakes a film, and  it kidnaps it, and then it's all...  Yeah.  It's just...  And then the camera goes into...  The camera moves in a way where you know even as an audience, because you're sophisticated,  and you know enough now to know a camera could not possibly do that.  Right.  So, you just sort of then go, oh, it's an effect.  Yeah.  When you see planes actually in the air with stuntmen on the wings of the plane, and all 
[02:28:00]  of that.  It was horrifying.  Amazing.  It was horrifying, and it was uncomfortable to watch.  I mean, nobody likes being outside of a plane, but it was uncomfortably frightening.  Yeah.  That down shot.  I was like, my hands got sweaty.  I was like, oh, it was really, really unbelievable.  And the CGI that is used, it's used to enhance the movie.  Yeah.  And for things that obviously you can't do, certain destructive scenes in a city, obviously 
[02:28:30]  you can't do that.  But it's done so well, it looks very realistic.  And then the other things, like you're saying, the stunts, when there's just no replicating  a real truck flipping over, a real aircraft in distress, you just can't do that.  Yeah.  And he's chosen to shoot, I think he shot, 65% of the movie was on IMAX.  Oh.  Whereas I think last time he shot maybe sort of 10%. 
[02:29:00]  And refuses to do, he doesn't, he feels that for a movie like this, that the trend is 3D.  Yeah.  But it's sort of, it makes something, oddly, it's stereoscopic.  It makes it, it makes it in a way, it brings it, it closes it in.  Your experience is...  That's odd, because it is almost like you're looking in a window. 
[02:29:30]  At it, instead of being part of it, you're kind of looking through a window at this 3D  movie.  That's a great point.  As opposed to the IMAX, it's just huge and it's around you and you feel more immersive.  And it's film.  Yeah.  And it's, and it's the best, it's the best film you can get.  I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't sort of come, it's sort of better than that.  Yeah.  The neg is four or five times the size of a regular 35 mil.  I'm still a Viewmaster guy.  That's me.  You like that. 
[02:30:00]  You remember the little Viewmasters that you would just do a little...  I love those.  Those were the greatest.  Those were great.  Yeah, yeah.  They look so realistic in there.  That's how I know I'm an older man, though.  Like, if I'm joking with a 21-year-old girl, I'm like, Viewmaster, and she's like, what?  I'm like, ugh, fuck.  Oh, I'll take your clothes off.  Stop talking like my age, you know.  Just act like one of the kids.  But I remember those pens.  I mean, you know the pens where you take them off and the bikini?  Yeah.  Yes.  Dropped away from them.  Yeah, that was so hot.  That's what we had.  You could never get any work done.  That was about the naughtiest thing you could...  Yes. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  They actually sell actually now naked girls tied to pens.  That's what you buy now, which is much better.  And they're cheaper.  Yeah.  When you do something like that, you were great.  Your performance was great.  And it's like, but I think people look so much, like in the last one, it was Ledger,  and then they look at Bane and the character and the effects, and there's so much around.  It's like, do you think that they see how great your performance really is?  Like, it's unbelievable.  And it's like, you're not watching it going, wow, Commissioner Gordon is awesome. 
[02:31:00]  But it was a great performance, and it's like, it's hard when there's comic book characters.  Does that make sense?  Yeah, but when you take on something like this, you go in knowing that, I mean, I always  see it as a, in a way, I am the vase, you know, and Bane is the flowers, Batman's the  flowers, and you tend to look at the flowers.  But they have to, they have to stand up in something. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You know, so that's, that's kind of how I, yeah, he's that sort of, he's sort of the  conscience of Batman.  He's the sort of moral, even though that in this movie that is compromise.  Yeah.  He is the sort of moral core of these films.  What a great way to look at it.  He's called Jim Gordon, you know, he's honest and virtuous, and he has moral certainty, wants 
[02:32:00]  to, you know, to serve, loves Gotham, and all of that.  So I kind of sort of see it like that.  So you do, you take a back seat when you, when you play a role like this, you kind of  know what you're.  Well, there was a, in this one, kind of a, it was something a little distressing about  your morality in this one.  Yeah.  Which was an interesting little twist on it.  I don't, no spoilers from me. 
[02:32:30]  No spoilers.  No spoilers from me.  But he gets a chance to redeem himself.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I watched you carefully during it.  Like I watched in those moments when you're looking around the wall.  Like I was watching.  Almost stalkerish.  Yeah, I just kept saying, every time you would come on screen, I would just stand up  and scream, shut up, Gary's talking.  It really bothered people.  But it was very interesting to watch your face through it.  Like, because I thought that as the movie had just started, and I was just watching, 
[02:33:00]  like as an actor, I'm like, the amount of emotion I could see on your face.  Like, I'm like, is everybody understanding how great?  Maybe they were.  But I really was thinking that as I'm watching it, like, what is, he really is thinking this  through as a character.  Like, you're not just doing it like, okay, show up and read the lines straight.  Like, it was like a real role.  Does that make any sense?  Like, I was watching you do it like, fuck, this is good.  And I hope it's not being, you know, I hope people aren't looking at the, oh, and not  getting how great that is. 
[02:33:30]  Well, I mean, you got, I think, it's someone, I saw a review or something, and they said,  you know, that Gary, you know, and Morgan Freeman, deliver as expected.  Deliver as expected.  It might be nice.  I think they mean well.  Yeah.  Kind of a backhanded compliment, though, isn't it?  Yeah.  But you, you know, we're all, you're going to look at, you're going to look at, you know, 
[02:34:00]  I think, the new guys in the, that have joined us.  Well, that's true, yeah.  And then you, it's, I mean, Anne Hathaway.  She is so sexy.  She's great.  Wow.  She's just a real surprise in the film, I think.  She really is.  First of all, she's beautiful in it.  Yeah.  And the cat suit, it makes, she's amazing.  Oh, I thought you were going to say it was too revealing.  Because I didn't care about it either.  I didn't like it, Jimmy.  Yeah.  She, she owned her and she owned it. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  She just owned Catwoman.  And her kicking ass like that, there's something about a girl just kicking ass like that that's  very entertaining to watch, very sexy.  Yeah.  It was, it was great.  And I thought she was very, very sexy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I kept looking at her lips.  Really?  She had very sexy lips throughout the whole movie.  Yeah.  I figured I'd add that.  You know, Tom Hardy has very sexy lips, but they were covered up.  Yeah, yeah.  They were covered up by the mask the whole time.  Do you, do you, by the way, when they say you deliver as expected, that's a, I guess 
[02:35:00]  it is a compliment though.  It's almost like you guys are expected to be great.  So when you're great, it's almost like you're not going to get praised anymore.  Like, Oldman was great.  Because honestly, and even if you weren't here, I'd say no one's ever, I've never heard,  wow, Gary Oldman was not good in that.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you're just expected to be great.  Oh, there's been a few.  There have been a couple.  I've got a few.  A few of those that reside only on Netflix or.  Yeah, a couple of them that you're not happy with.  Oh, there's a few out.  I'm not going to name.  You don't name? 
[02:35:30]  I would love you.  Do you like watching yourself?  Like, do you like, like, you'll go to the premiere, obviously.  Do you like to watch yourself?  Or every time you come on, do you go?  Yeah, you know, you're, you see, you see things that other people don't see.  That they won't see, right, right.  Yeah, so you could be hung up about a thing or, I mean, we've all got it.  We've all, I mean, everybody, I mean, I don't know what, I don't know how Paul Newman used  to feel when he looked in the mirror.  I'm sure he felt pretty great. 
[02:36:00]  Sure.  You know, I would like to, you know, that's a confident man for you, but, you know, we've  all got stuff that we, yeah, baggage about.  Can you tell us what, a couple of insecurities.  I want to know what his thing is.  Yeah, what's your, if you have insecurity watching yourself, I know, it'll help everybody.  I have no shot.  That's, that's frightening.  But, no, no, no, but it's not, it's not, it's, it's in your head, isn't it? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's all that it is.  No one else is going to see what you're seeing when you watch yourself.  It's just not going to happen.  And occasionally you can, I tell you a film that I sat through and watched with, with,  just the easiest movie to watch that I was in was Hannibal.  Hmm.  Because I was the, uh, the guy who cut off his face, you know, and I was, I wore, even  the shape of my ears, it was different. 
[02:37:00]  And you couldn't see me.  Hmm.  And I achieved what I wanted to achieve, which is to completely disappear.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, so I could sit and watch that.  I didn't have to look at.  You weren't looking at yourself.  Yeah.  And I'm not looking at the things that, that bug me about yourself when you, I, I did a,  I have them too.  And, uh, I did an audition yesterday.  Actually, I read for Luc Besson for the first, for the first time. 
[02:37:30]  You read for Luc?  Yeah.  Um, that's much more enthusiasm than he probably had about it.  It went okay.  I didn't know he was going to be in the room.  It's always a nice surprise.  You're going on tape and then you walk in.  You're like, this is Luc.  I'm like, I know who it is.  It went, it went okay.  It was only four lines.  But before him, he, uh, he, he actually tells you, he's like, okay, well, you, you know,  do it this way because the situation itself is frightening and you don't want to overact.  And I'm like, does he tell that to everybody or has he just seen my work?  He's like, I don't think I'm going to get the part, but I mean, it was still, uh, I 
[02:38:00]  think I'm wrong for it to be honest, but it was, uh, it was odd to have a guy like  that telling you something.  It was comforting in a weird way to have him telling you that before.  Yeah.  He likes to tell you, but he does tell you, right?  Because he talks like this and it's all going up.  Like, I want you to do stand like this and look like this.  And, um, we had to, I had about half an hour of that on the first day.  And I said, this is not very active friendly.  No, huh?  Just let me do my thing. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, really?  Well, you can't, you, um, you can't, you have to have a certain, you can't put people  and move them around in a way that is, uh, you know, and when you get to that line, now  you look here and then you say it like this.  It's the worst thing you can do to an actor is give them a line reading, right?  Right, right, right.  Tell them or show them how to say it. 
[02:39:00]  I mean, with Chris, Chris doesn't really, uh, he doesn't act.  Chris Nolan, he doesn't act.  He has never acted.  He finds it sort of just a mysterious thing that we do and loves to, uh, be surprised.  So when he's got you on the set, you know, he, he would never, he couldn't step in and  show you if he wanted to.  And that, I would assume that as an actor, it's almost a little put offish to be told 
[02:39:30]  how to do your job.  You know better than anybody how to do what you do.  Yeah, I think if you cast well, uh-huh, then, then that's half of it done.  Yeah.  You can't, it's, you can't really micromanage every little.  Now, some directors have been very successful doing that, though, micromanaging.  Some directors have real pricks to work for and, and, but they put out amazing movies. 
[02:40:00]  Well, did Kubrick micromanage that?  They're saying Gary has to rap too in a second because he has the Today Show.  Boo!  I know.  But, uh, did, did he micromanage or did he just tell you to do it 80 times and not  tell you how?  No, he would just tell you that, that was, uh, that was, you, you know, originally, this  is, I, I think this is a true story.  Originally, Harvey Keitel was in the Eyes Wide Shut.  He was playing the Sidney Pollock. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And, uh, they said, you can't do this because we need someone who will keep their pants  on.  Probably guys that likes to be naked.  He certainly did.  But he was doing, but he, he was doing this, uh, he was doing the scene and, uh, I think  they, they were just walking through a door and, um, uh, can I curse?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Please.  So he's walking through, like, he's walking through a door and I think that after the 68  take of this, walking through the door, Harvey Keitel just said, yeah, he said, I'm out of  here, you're fucking crazy. 
[02:41:00]  68 takes of walking through a door.  Yeah.  You're fucking out of your mind.  And that was it?  Yeah.  And left.  Wow.  Like, because he didn't say, he would just say, do it again.  Not why or do it differently.  What are you looking for?  Yeah.  Just do it again.  And I don't know whether he was looking for something, uh, very specific, but he wasn't  going to tell you or whether, I mean, I, I, I love Kubrick's films and, um, but, but 
[02:41:30]  I don't know how I would have worked with that.  Right.  I don't know how I would have, you know.  Well, it's two completely different things of enjoying his movie and working on it.  I would assume that would be, uh, uh, quite a close.  Chris Nolan's two takes.  That's amazing.  Three takes.  And it looks great.  And then he wants Gary.  We've got to get you out of here.  Yeah.  I think Gary has to go.  We've got to get to the today's shot.  Please.  What do we, how do we promote, um, you know, what do you, what do you say if the Dark Knight 
[02:42:00]  arises?  You know, uh, it's fantastic blockbuster.  Yeah.  It's going to be a tremendous success and you're awesome in it.  I really, I'm happy.  I watched you.  It's great.  Everything, but it was just great to watch you and wonder what was going on in your head  because it was a real character.  It wasn't, you didn't come off as window dressing at all.  Um, like you didn't come off as a vase.  You know what I mean?  If that makes, by the way, if you're just tuning in and you heard me say that you probably  want to spit in my face.  I'm quoting Gary.  I didn't, I'm not saying that.  Gary, thanks so much for coming in again. 
[02:42:30]  We love you, man.  Thank you.  Gary Oldman, everyone.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, wow.  Gary Oldman.  What a cool guest.  That is.  That's a big star right there, too.  A real star.  That's a real fucking star right there.  Big star.  Came back on our show. 
[02:43:00]  He's shit-talking Hollywood a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  Just a little bit.  He can.  He's a Hollywood royalty.  Anthony, I got a...  That's great.  I don't know.  I like fights, right?  Can you assholes do an interview not full of spoilers?  Oh, look at me.  I saw the movie already.  And then he hashtags it, cunt.  All right.  Please tell me what was spoiled.  Thank you.  That's the only reason why I'm reading this guy's tweet.  I usually ignore this shit.  What was spoiled?  That Gary Oldman was in the movie. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  What was spoiled?  What, that his character had redemption?  I didn't say anything about what it was.  That's pretty much every movie.  Every movie, a character has redemption.  There was not one fucking...  That's the only thing I can think of.  Hey, dickbag, shit fuck.  How about you tweet and say what we spoiled?  Go ahead.  I dare you.  There was no spoiler, you cock.  And we are in a tough spot because for some of these guys that come in, they want us to  see the movie and then we have all this information and you try really hard not to give too much 
[02:44:00]  away.  Hey, asshole, you want me to really fucking spoil it?  No.  Yeah, see?  I won't.  I won't.  I'll be a good guy.  But you know what?  If I wanted to, I could fucking blow it up.  Blow it up.  But I have it on good authority that there are three endings to the movie.  So you can't really blow it up.  What?  They're not going to play three different endings? 
[02:44:30]  No, that's the beauty of the whole thing.  You don't know which ending you're going to see.  That's going to get people to go back more than once.  Yeah, do you think that's eventually going to be a new marketing play?  Of course.  Multiple endings?  God, that's so stupid.  They started with...  It's Clue.  That was 20 years ago.  And they started with this movie.  They want you to go back to see all three endings.  They're not going to tell you which theaters have the endings.  Yeah, exactly.  And that gets rid of spoilers.  But what if you go in and see the same ending?  Well, it sucks for you.  You've got to go in again.  Then you're pissed. 
[02:45:00]  It's like buying baseball cards and getting the same cards in the pack.  Oh, man.  Yep.  But we didn't give much away at all.  I'm going to get it on a laser disc.  There's so much we want to say about this movie.  Yeah.  So much.  You did mention the opening scene.  I said it was action-packed.  It was amazing.  It's an aircraft-related fucking...  And that's not even a spoiler because that was shown already.  You're going to see planes in the sky with stuntmen jumping down the wings.  That was shown before Mission Impossible 3.  That's not a spoiler.  Yes, it was shown before Mission Impossible 3. 
[02:45:30]  The only thing I can think of.  Where's McFoley?  He asked for this favor and he's not here yet?  He's not here yet.  That son of a bitch.  I know.  Roland, why are you bringing that here?  Are you kidding?  No.  I'm not...  All right, whatever.  The Three Stooges could eat my ass.  Who the fuck watched The Three Stooges?  Get the fuck out of here with that shit.  Get out of here. 
[02:46:00]  Hey, good morning, you.  I heard it was good.  I heard rumors that it was pretty good, too.  I ain't watching them.  It's not a principle.  I can't go watch The Three Stooges movie.  I ain't fucking watching it.  Hey, doorman, get it.  Oh, yeah.  Whoa.  Yeah, it's right.  51%.  It's fresh.  I'll give these to my doorman.  And then he'll fucking bootleg copies.  Bootleg them.  Sell them.  Sell them off the side.  Nice.  Nice.  So, it was a big deal yesterday that McFoley needed a little favor from us because he's  got comedy shows coming up and he's doing something with Raw. 
[02:46:30]  And we got back to Mick like we could squeeze in at the end of the show because we've got  a very busy show.  And now he's not even here?  Well, that'll be great because he'll be talking with Sam Roberts on the after show.  Yep.  Ooh.  Enough of that.  Let me see.  You need to change the Chicago date to coincide with the Bruce Springsteen's spring roll.  Bruce Springsteen's. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  It should say Bruce Springsteen shows in September.  No.  We won't.  This is my number one connection.  She gets me a lot of good shit.  A lot of good shit.  Really?  So, now we just sit here because McFoley's late.  Well, you know what?  He's late for his own favor.  He is late.  He's two minutes late for his own favor.  You're right.  You'd think a favor.  He'd be early.  And we got to go home early today.  Not early.  My truck is going to be outside at 10 and I got to go. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got things to do.  Very busy, man.  Did Jimmy quit the show?  I guess so.  You quit?  You want to see something so fucking bitchin' cool?  What happened?  I got to show you this fucking app.  The iPhone is your life now.  Oh, I thought you quit, Jimmy.  Sam says he just signed in.  McFoley just signed in.  He's late for his own favor.  Late for his own favor.  Do you see what this says right there?  What time is he supposed to be here?  Three minutes ago.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  I can control my pool from my iPhone. 
[02:48:00]  Cool.  It's not your pool that's going to kill you.  It's unfortunate that you can't control other aspects of your life.  Oh, you suck.  That's true.  So you can turn on the hot tub if you're feeling like I got to heat that shit up.  Oh, the heaters, the booster pump, everything.  It's just amazing.  That's pretty cool.  That's cool.  There's air conditioners now that have apps where you can control the air conditioner. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, so you could have it off.  And then when you're driving home, you turn that shit on.  It's nice when you get home.  I'm just amazed at what's available now.  The future is here.  I was thinking about the future yesterday.  I was in Central Park.  I was biking with my son.  There was an older guy on a bike in front of me.  There was a bunch of black utes walking down this path that we were both biking on.  I think the older gentleman, older than me, panicked for whatever reason because these utes were normal kids. 
[02:49:00]  Just all of a sudden bikes off the path and does a fucking header.  And me, my son even, he's young, but he understood how hilarious that was.  We're howling, and the black kids that were just done playing basketball, for real, they were, were all just howling.  And then they went and helped the guy.  And I was thinking to myself, the future, I would have got that on video.  Right now, you have to pick what you're going to film. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  And I flashed forward and said, I bet you we're all just going to be wired for video eventually.  Did you constantly record?  No, because I didn't know the guy was going to fall.  It constantly records.  And if I got this video, I swear to you, and yes, I'm obsessed with this, and I'll admit it, it would have been a viral video.  It was that fucking funny, the circumstances with the black kids coming and him.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking to myself, eventually, this is where it's all going.  We're all just going to be wired for video, videoing our entire lives, and then selecting what you want to pop up on your Facebook or whatever, whatever it will be in the future. 
[02:50:00]  Like if you see something.  That's where it's going, I guarantee it.  You just hit a button, and it'll fucking save it.  Yeah, because right now, we all are videotaping off our phones, right, for the most part?  Yeah.  But eventually, it's just going to be on seeing what you're seeing, and then you'll pick what you want to post that day.  I had just this weird vision, like I bet you that's where it goes.  The future.  But man, it killed me.  This guy flying over the handlebars.  He was fine in the end.  It was one of the best laughs I've had in a long fucking time. 
[02:50:30]  Everyone was laughing.  Here's Mick Foley.  Wow, he lost weight.  No, there he is.  Yeah.  Mick!  Hey, Mick.  It's like home.  How you doing, man?  How you doing, man?  Buddy, how are you?  Who's that?  This is Hugh.  He's going to put the earmuffs on.  That's not me.  That's not me.  He was nine.  Huh?  And he's, yeah, so he's going to put the earmuffs on when he needs to.  Oh, I don't care.  That's fine.  Is he your son?  They're figurative, yeah.  Okay.  That's your son. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, that's his Hughie.  Very cool.  Okay, cool.  How old are you, bro?  Nine.  Nice.  Do you know how famous your father is?  Yeah.  You do?  Yeah.  He looks like you.  Wow, man.  In the smile.  Yeah, he's got it.  In the mouth, the smile.  You're definitely...  Is that a compliment there, Norton?  Um, I apologize for saying that, Hugh.  No kid wants to hear you look like his father.  Where do I know you?  We met at Patrice's, uh...  Yes!  General.  Yes!  Okay.  You're off mic.  All right.  No, we heard him pretty good, though.  You know what I mean?  It beats...  Oh, cool.  But he's one of those loud guys, so it's good. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I am, yeah.  You flew all the way from London for you.  How fucking funny was that Dennis Leary thing?  That was one of the greatest...  What happened?  You had him in last week, and I don't...  You played the song before he...  Oh, shit.  And I fucking...  How?  Because I could feel you blushing when he walks in.  I couldn't tell who was taking the piss.  Like, you...  Let me explain to this guy.  He's a...  You're a big fan of our show, if I remember our conversation.  Yeah, I am.  And you do comedy, and you're from London, and you flew in for Patrice's wake, right? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, well, Patrice and I met in 97, and that's how I kind of got into the show.  Because you just jumped in there, so as a fan, you were listening to what we did with  Dennis Leary's song before he came in here.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I forgot about that.  And that was like...  I hope he's a good sport.  The thing is, you get actually...  It's amazing on a radio show that you've managed to convey your awkwardness.  Because he comes in, and he goes, what the fuck's wrong with you?  And you're like, I can't even...  Oh, nothing.  No, it's great.  It's all good.  Yeah, good. 
[02:52:30]  That's it right there.  Are we on air?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh!  I love when that happens.  I thought there was a pregnant pause.  No, no, no.  Oh, no, this is how we do it.  I'm a huge mark.  I mean, it's kind of bittersweet, because I figured it would always be either Jeffries  or Patrice that brought us in.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, well.  That's Foley.  Foley brought you in.  It's a downer.  No, it's a downer, man.  It's a downer, man.  You can't walk down New York City streets with him. 
[02:53:00]  No, huh?  Mick Foley?  Everyone knows him.  We were talking about it last night.  Like, Mick is so famous.  I think there's about five islands where the $10 note is a picture of him taking a big curly  shit.  Hey, his son, his son, nice to go.  He's got the earmuffs on there.  The earmuffs.  He already said the F word 80 times.  Here was the problem I dealt with when he was younger, is that I would tell him about,  you hardly ever hear me.  I think I dropped the one F-bomb when I was quoting Batman.  Adam West, right? 
[02:53:30]  He's Adam West.  He looks up the first page of my book and he goes, I think I just lost my fucking ear.  And then he turns to me and he goes, you've got a very captivating writing style.  But I was, you know, we'd tell the kids about the bad words.  And then this kid, you know, he's a bright one.  About five years ago, he was four years old.  Dad, how can they be bad words if people are so happy when they say them?  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  That is really clever.  Yes, that's very clever for a four-year-old especially. 
[02:54:00]  Now he's nine and he's telling me what's wrong with my comedy style.  And he was telling me the difference between an idiom and a metaphor.  You want to explain it on the air, Huey?  Yeah, what is it?  Come on up here.  Come on, Huey.  He said, he goes, yeah, I made this statement.  I said that that's got my handwriting all over it.  And the kids didn't laugh because they didn't realize I was using it as an idiom.  That's what he said?  Yeah, an idiom, yeah.  I don't know what an idiom is.  Well, have Huey explain it. 
[02:54:30]  Come on up, Huey.  We don't bite it.  Yeah, you got a mic right there.  Go ahead.  You got a mic.  You can be all comfortable.  We don't bite, I swear.  No pressure.  No one's looking at you.  This isn't your big moment.  All right.  Go ahead and explain it just like you.  The only reason I knew is because I'd done a pilot with the guy who played the evil sensei  in the first.  Oh, yeah, karate kid.  And we used the word idiom there where he described somebody as a flavor of the month.  Or I said flavor of the month.  He goes, what's your favorite flavor?  And I said, it's a metaphor.  And then they corrected me.  They said, no, no, actually, it's an idiom. 
[02:55:00]  And he goes, mine's rum raisin.  Go ahead, Huey.  Idiom.  What?  Go ahead and explain it to me.  What is an idiom?  I don't know what it is.  Yeah, we really don't know.  I'm thinking what it was.  I can't remember.  All right.  So what's a simile?  When you use it.  Did you ever see that episode of Larry Sanders where Hank.  I'm thinking Cindy Brady.  Dates a regular woman.  Yeah, he's kind of nervous.  And they bring the kid in. 
[02:55:30]  And Hank, like, turns the kid's head on telly.  And the wife, like, doesn't want to see him anymore.  That's what you just did to your kid.  Mr. Foley.  Come on, Huey.  Come through for me, man.  I'm going to try to deduct this on my taxes.  Yeah, there you go.  I need this trip to be legal.  So tell me something on the air.  This is a deduction.  What?  What is an idiom?  I don't know how to explain it.  This is more awkward than the Dennis Larrick thing.  Sorry, man.  It's got a figurative meaning. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  I mean, you know, it's comprehended in regards to, you know, the common use of an expression.  Something like that, man.  So you guys are doing comedy shows together, Mick?  That's what I'm getting here.  Yeah.  Burnsy, he...  Funny guy?  Yeah, great.  I mean, honestly, I listened to his CD from start to finish.  He gave me the DVDs, but the format wouldn't work.  He came into a couple of guest spots on my shows in the UK and just killed.  He'd never done wrestling material before. 
[02:56:30]  He's been a big wrestling fan.  If there is a knock, if there's a knock, sir, on his comedy, it's that it's really, really  deep and maybe not appreciated by everybody, but everybody will be able...  But he's, you know, got the chops and...  I'll be...  I'm a bit apprehensive because I'm petrified of your audience.  Oh.  Don't be...  They're a great comedy audience.  Yeah, great comedy audience.  No, I'm not even joking.  I mean, they sit there and they appreciate good comedy.  But then how come whenever you do, like, a live show, it's just baying fucking animals? 
[02:57:00]  Because it's not a comedy.  I'm telling you, we promote everybody and they sit there and listen.  No, it's not a show.  Brendan...  They really are.  He came in and he was so excited last night.  He really...  To answer your question, he did a couple of guest spots and when they said, hey, we have  a special guest here, when they said Brendan Burns, I mean, I looked out and people  were, like, looking at each other, like, doing the double thing, like, you've got to be  kidding me and he went out and he's, you know, he's...  People who have never heard him, he's amazing and he's respected and known around the world 
[02:57:30]  so he took me under his wing.  He's bringing me to Montreal.  We're doing a combined show called Good God Almighty, a little tip of the Stetson to  J.R. there.  But he came in and he was saying what a big show he was and I went, Brendan, biggest difference  between O&A and Howard Stern.  And just gave him that broad question.  I didn't narrow it down and his answer was?  As far as the guests.  You think he's trying to be a love...  See that chemistry?  See that chemistry between us?  He's got so much of a jet lag. 
[02:58:00]  Was, uh, you guys let the comics talk?  Yes.  Yeah.  It's...  He's pretty much just...  No, he's going to be the...  He's sucking his own dick for...  ...three hours.  And that man cow cunt can fuck right off as well.  Sorry.  He!  Hey, I don't know if you...  Yeah, you might have to leave the studio.  The C word's too much for you.  I didn't use it in England as a comma.  I just saw it.  You gotta explain that to Huey.  Yes.  What?  Country.  I said country.  I'm from a different country.  Plug in.  And the C word over there, it's a compliment. 
[02:58:30]  See if Roland can hook him up there.  Man, he's psychologically scarred.  Oh, he let the comics be, you know, funny.  Well, I think it's...  And shine.  What happened on ManCal?  No, I've never baited on it.  I just can't stand...  I think you guys are just right.  Oh.  You have an ass.  Where are you guys doing your comedy shows?  We are...  We're doing two in Long Island tonight.  The Brokerage and Belmore.  It's okay.  This is like a plug.  It's a great, great gig.  I've done that room.  It's a great club.  It is.  You know, to me, like, governors...  New owners, right?  Yeah.  New owners.  Same people own Governors and Maguires. 
[02:59:00]  And they do a good job.  And they're not small venues.  They're intimate audiences.  Nice.  So Brokerage is a little more intimate than Governors, which is kind of like a bar.  Yeah, Governors is bigger, but I love both.  I haven't done Governors in years.  I've fucking got a bonus one with the old owners.  The old owners.  The new owners I like a lot.  The guy actually gave me extra money.  He was so great.  Good guy.  This fucking new dude.  Good guy.  And then we're doing...  So we're doing that tonight.  Tickets are slim for that one.  If you left, and then we have, I guess, plenty left for Thursday in Bohemia. 
[02:59:30]  Maguires in Bohemia.  And then we go to the Jersey Shore, and we do three shows down from about a half an hour south  of Staten Island to Atlantic City.  People can go to realmcfoley.com and hit events if they're interested in going.  And then we do three shows in Montreal.  So for me, I mean, you guys know this is like the Super Bowl.  You know, I'm coming here.  He's kind of vouching for me, and there'll be, you know, some press there, and we've got  to have this thing right.  I want to go to the Montreal Comedy Festival.  Do it, man. 
[03:00:00]  It's huge this year.  It's their 30th anniversary.  There's so many guys going.  End of the month?  Yeah, end of the month.  27th, 28th.  I'll be there for a couple.  I'm going to be up there.  You should do a show there.  I'm doing a show with Saget.  It's a live broadcast.  What day?  I go up the, I have to do something the 26th.  It's some warm-up show.  And the 27th, next Thursday, Friday, next Friday, I'm actually shooting.  Amy Schumer's doing it, and Saget's hosting it.  You guys should take the show up there.  There's like every coming year in the world.  That would be cool, yeah. 
[03:00:30]  Why don't we?  Yeah, we should.  Make it happen.  There we go.  Make it happen.  Make it happen.  Why don't we just do it?  It's like Canada.  We're on in Canada.  Let's leave.  Let's leave and do it next week.  Literally do.  Why don't we just do that?  Because I'll drive up there.  You'll get so many comedians who will come on.  You'll get them on the air, too.  Oh, my God.  There's so many guys from around the world that you would love.  Jimmy Carr is very funny.  Just like Maxwell.  There's so many.  Andrew Maxwell?  Yeah.  We had him in.  Yeah, Jim Jeffrey's circle of buddies over there.  What a drunk he is. 
[03:01:00]  Andrew Maxwell.  He was a little St. Paddy's Day the next morning.  Oh, yeah.  He was cool, man.  He was a cool guy.  We had no idea how big he was.  Maxwell was like this.  He was just a drunk to us that day on the couch.  I googled him, and I went, holy fuck, this guy's huge.  He's good.  He's good.  He's the comics comic.  He's the only guy I know that when he's working a broad room,  I can't tell he's working broad.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Now he's talking sharp.  Norton Brennan's talking sharp.  I was talking to a guy at the cellar last night. 
[03:01:30]  I forget his name.  He's from London.  I want to do the comedy store out there.  I heard that's a great room.  Yeah, it's a great room.  And I've always kind of resisted traveling to Europe,  but I do want to do the store.  But you don't need to do the store.  The way that England works is there's a circuit.  There's a club circuit, and there's club comics.  And that's where you kind of get your start,  and you're running with thoroughbreds,  and, you know, it's all headliners doing 20 minutes.  But then everyone goes to the Edinburgh Festival  and starts writing their own hour,  building their own audience,  and then you go on the road.  Which is why when, like, Voss and the guys go over and go, 
[03:02:00]  ah, the comic sucks.  You know, if you're at a gig and every comic on the bill is shit,  I'd start asking myself some questions.  Because he was going to the shitty gigs.  There's guys you would love out there,  and you should be on in Europe.  I have to, I'm afraid I have to download you,  but I can't, I tried to get it through Amazon.  That's why a podcast would be great,  because we couldn't be able to try that, too.  Yeah, it would be anywhere.  They're discussing that one as well.  We have all the ideas that'll work,  but for some reason it just gets stuck in the cogs. 
[03:02:30]  I want to ask you something, Mick,  you're talking about walking down the street.  What name do people, like, yell out the most?  I don't mean to sound racial,  but it depends on the race.  Really?  It's usually Mick Foley.  Wait, that's perfectly racial.  African.  I know, it's just through trial and reputation.  No dude love.  It's Mankind for Afro-Americans.  Mick Foley.  And Mick Foley for white guys.  And Asians.  Do black guys like it? 
[03:03:00]  They stop making the pictures, right?  They do.  This was, I think, in 1992,  when I first got the idea that,  I remember Robert,  this is going to sound terrible, too,  Robert Fuller telling me in Memphis in 1988,  you know, I was like just struggling.  He was like,  Jacko, we're going to make it.  And I was like,  what do you mean I'm going to make it?  You've got the black audience.  And I said,  what do you mean?  And his, you know,  theory,  his dad was a promoter,  was that, you know,  people who'd been lied to  and taken advantage of  for so many generations  could see through the BS. 
[03:03:30]  Nice.  And they could see something real there,  character-wise.  So I got lost one time  driving to a radio station in Atlanta,  and it was like that Rocky II scene,  you know,  where kids were chasing after me  and chanting my  I was Cactus Jack at that time.  And I've always,  I mean,  I've always appreciated it.  Brendan thought it was odd  that I was knocking on doors  campaigning for Obama.  Oh, yeah.  This is,  have you guys heard this line?  I love this story.  This is where I dropped the F-bomb here.  I'm like knocking on the doors 
[03:04:00]  because I didn't want to do anything  on the air or above the radar  because even Huckabee was,  he was getting slammed  for having Chuck Norris  campaigning for it.  I'm like,  I'm a wrestler.  Chuck Norris has counted  to infinity twice,  you know,  and he's getting slammed.  So I'm knocking on doors  in, you know,  some of the lower income areas  and this woman of color  opens up the door  and she goes,  you're the nigga  that got thrown off  the motherfucking cell.  And I was like,  I had my,  my mouth just dropped  and I didn't know what to say. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, it's a cage, man.  I finally went,  I've never been called that before.  You know,  he heard me tell his story  in the UK  and he was shocked,  you know,  that they would send me out  to, you know,  to knock on,  you know,  doors in an ethnic area.  I was like,  no, man,  I've got that following.  I don't know why.  But that's hysterical  sending a guy  that looks like a lumberjack  to go and try  and convince black people  to vote for a f-bomb.  It looks like  either he's serving 
[03:05:00]  a summons  or a bounty hunter  or something,  you know.  He's going to possess  your car.  You're going to  warrant your arrest.  Oh, hey,  have I got a thing  that you'd love?  Oh, yeah.  You'd love gadgets.  Yes.  A brain cross.  Can I ask a guess?  How young is she?  Schindler says  that's the last track.  Can we continue?  What have you got 
[03:05:30]  that he would love?  Avoided copy  of the Emancipation Proclamation?  It doesn't matter  what I got.  I want to hear  everything you reckon.  Our human emotion.  Sickle salad.  Oh, you motherfucker.  Jesus.  What have you got,  friend?  Yeah, we need to know.  An anti-pepper spray  anti-team.  It's like a bad rap.  Everyone is shitting  themselves at this,  but you would love it.  It's a portable gaming unit. 
[03:06:00]  It's called G-A-E-M-Z.  And you know how,  like, when you go  to some hotel sometimes  and you can't plug  your gaming unit  into the TV?  Uh-huh.  It's its own little  portable gaming unit  and you just plug it in  and it has its own telly.  That sounds pretty big, though.  It is pretty big.  Yeah?  Oh, there you go.  You're not...  I'm not totally thrilled.  And Mick cared so much  he left the show.  Back to casual racism.  And Mick's like,  fuck you.  I did actually see  on the way in,  there was like...  Because I've never been 
[03:06:30]  to New York in the summer  and there are just a lot  of black fellas  playing basketball  in cages.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  There's like big playgrounds  with chain-link fences  and...  Because you're like,  way to confirm  your stereotype, fellas.  It's too hot  to do that shit.  But you're right.  I think you wouldn't  make it look  so prison-y.  Very prison-y.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can't have nets  because they get cut down.  It's got to be chain-linked.  You know what I mean?  It has to be.  And then the fences  have to be high  because the ball  would pop out  and go into traffic. 
[03:07:00]  So it looks kind of,  you know,  very institutional.  Thousandth episode  of Raw coming up.  Thank you.  Yeah, I want to ask  you about that.  I want to ask you about that.  It's an official WWE appearance.  Because we're going to  tag-team this interview  to Sam in a couple minutes.  Yeah.  Before we leave,  what are you doing with Raw?  Man, it's the thousandth episode.  I mean, that's huge.  It's just 20 years.  I guess it's the longest  running weekly show.  At least that's what I hear  on Raw.  And they're inviting  a select few  or a bunch of guys back  and I'm one of them.  So I'll be at the show. 
[03:07:30]  I've got my plane ticket.  It doesn't necessarily mean  I'm on the show.  Things change.  But I was flattered.  Anyone watch the build-up  to this thousandth?  Well, I'm sure Sam.  Sam, yeah.  They were doing that great.  I love how all the wrestlers  know him as a stalker.  They talk about Sam  the way Reagan would point  at Hinkley  if he was on the radio with them.  I think CM Punk and John Cena  are going to be fighting  for the title, right?  Could be, yeah.  They go to three hours  and in the lead-up  to the thousandth episode 
[03:08:00]  they were doing great moments  in Raw history  and I was like,  they put me in like three of them.  Like three of the twelve, man.  Sometimes I forget.  They did  This Is Your Life  with The Rock.  Oh, that's beautiful.  The Cell wasn't on Raw.  The Cell was on pay-per-view.  To me, it's just wrestling.  First, uh...  I don't need it in a category.  That's dumb to me.  Yeah.  Well, they're celebrating  the thousandth.  Well, they showed  greatest moments  from Howdy Doody.  Fair enough.  It didn't have to be Raw. 
[03:08:30]  So, Rock,  This Is Your Life shit  was so fun.  That was good, right?  I forgot all about that.  Behind the scenes,  Vince was like  throwing stuff around.  Did you write  some of that stuff?  You know what it was?  I remember having,  like, you know,  they had a couple of  actors and actresses  and they were asking  for their lines  and I was like,  well, I'll call you out.  Rock will say something  and then I'll call this guy out  and the Rock will say something  and they're looking at him  and like,  this is how you do it?  He's like, yeah,  this is how we do it.  So, a segment that was  planned for 12 live 
[03:09:00]  on national TV  went 26.  Wow.  Vince was,  apparently he thought  it was one of the worst  things he'd ever seen  until the ratings came out.  Rock came over,  he tapped me on the shoulder  the next day,  he goes,  did you hear about the ratings?  Which I thought meant  they tanked  and that we could never  have any free reign again  and I was like,  no, what was he?  He goes, 8.4.  Oh, wow.  And it meant that  you couldn't even explain.  Now, maybe with Twitter  and cell phones  and everything,  you could explain  how that many people  changed channels  because it couldn't be explained  just by the people  who switched from Nitro to Raw. 
[03:09:30]  I mean,  people literally had to be  calling each other up  on the phone  saying,  you've got to watch this on TV.  So, we walked into Vince's office.  Or maybe you just had  a big lead-in.  It was instantaneous.  The show before and after  got a 15-7.  Vince went, okay.  Oh, damn it.  It was 9-11 footage  just before the show.  Can we do dueling, Vince's?  All right.  What do you want to do? 
[03:10:00]  You're fine.  Very good.  Very good.  All right, Beck.  I'll do the mellower, Vince.  This is our first meeting.  First time I met him  face-to-face.  We want to do  what's best for Mike.  Oh, no.  What does Mike want to do?  Nobody's ever  calling him Brent.  Mike.  Oh, man.  I don't know what to say  to the guy.  He was like,  try to tell the president  he has mustard on his chin. 
[03:10:30]  So, I just went with Mike  and apparently someone  corrected him  between the first  and second meetings.  I'll call you  whatever the hell  I want to call you.  Your name's Mike now.  I don't make mistakes.  Mike Foley.  What's your favorite  Vince bit ever?  Oh, man.  Mine is the whole kiss,  having people kiss his ass.  Kiss his ass was a great one.  I did it.  I joined that club.  Is it because he's a billionaire? 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  He didn't give a fuck  and he had people polishing it.  It was a whole thing.  It was hilarious.  My favorite just thing  that Vince used to do  a lot was in the ring  and he'd be mouthing off,  you know,  all badass and shit  and then music could start,  somebody's music  and the face he would make,  he'd turn around like,  oh, oh, oh.  Like he's freaking out.  I love that.  How's the thing  with Gary Oldman? 
[03:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's fucking great, man.  Because I did a scene  with Willem Dafoe  in a little movie  called Animorphs  and I'm watching him  as he's acting  and I'm like,  he's not really doing anything.  Then you look at the screen  and he's got all these  subtleties going on  and you compare that  with Vince  who's playing to the,  you know,  the upper deck  and so the conveying fear  would be very different  for Willem Dafoe.  Right, right.  Vince literally does that.  Yeah, it's not subtle.  And my favorite moment  with Vince actually 
[03:12:00]  is when they gave me  the hardcore title  and this was a love-hate relationship.  Do you remember,  I don't know,  this was like the Gloria era  where Vince hated me  but not as much  as he hated Austin.  He was using me  to get to Austin.  Right, yeah, yeah.  And then he goes,  you know, Mick,  in some ways,  I feel like I,  although I've lost a son,  because he and Shane  had a falling,  I feel like I've gained one too.  And I went,  geez, thanks, dad.  And in about two seconds,  his face ran the gamut  of emotions  like sucking on a sour lemon. 
[03:12:30]  And then he just,  you know,  he did the giggle  and it was just like,  this is genius.  Even when I would be away,  you know,  estranged from the show  and my kids would watch it,  I realized I either had to  watch it with the kids  or not watch in principle  or watch it and,  you know,  miss out on these  several hours a week.  And I'd be mad at Vince  on a personal level  but I'd watch him on that TV  and, you know,  couldn't help but laugh, man.  Yeah.  He's full of life.  Yeah, he's fucking hilarious, man.  Mick was banding my name 
[03:13:00]  around at WWE  as a new writer for them,  which would be like  a boy of a dream.  And it's preposterous to me  that my name's being bandied  around at McMahon headquarters.  And he goes,  but look,  you've got to realize  Brendan Vince thinks nothing  of like ringing you up  at 4 a.m.  and yelling and swearing at you.  And I'm like,  are you out of your fucking,  I once did so many mushrooms,  I'm still not sure  the world's real.  So Vince McMahon  yelling at me at 4 a.m.  is just going to be  another particularly amusing  part of the cartoon  that is my fucking life.  When you guys go to 4 a.m., 
[03:13:30]  just,  I've got an idea,  fuck it!  If you go to bat for somebody,  I mean,  have you done this  with like comedians,  like, you know,  your word means something,  I don't do it all the time  where I say,  hey, this is a good guy.  And I was pitching  Brendan's name  to the top people in WWE  but I was giving him  the caveat.  I was like,  you have to understand,  he's a little bit different.  You're either going to think  he's the greatest,  smartest writer  you've ever had  or you will kick him  out of the building  by the end of day one.  And they never took  a meeting with him.  Yes.  But if you go to hear 
[03:14:00]  his stuff,  his wrestling material  is just classic.  By the way,  I'm trying to interrupt you,  what did your son say  was wrong with your comedy?  What critique  did your kid give you?  He basically said  it's interesting  but not funny.  Wow.  No, no, no, no,  it was far more  crushing than that.  And he went on  for a while, right?  He goes,  he basically explained  that you don't know  how to segue properly yet.  That's what he was saying,  yeah.  He goes,  you tell a joke  and then you just start  going through a conversation.  He goes,  no, he goes,  no, no, no,  he goes,  no, no, no,  that's the flip opposite  of what he said. 
[03:14:30]  I was too hurt to listen.  Don't worry.  It'll get there.  Wow.  Are you happy  with how it's going?  Yeah, you know,  I really am  and I'm glad I listened  to his CD  from start to finish  because it made me realize,  hey, man,  I got to step it up.  You know,  I mean,  we're hitting these  two shows in Long Island  tonight.  What did I say it was?  The brokerage tonight  and then you're at  McGuire's Thursday.  And the guys,  I don't know if you know  Tim Gage from Long Island. 
[03:15:00]  Tim is one of those  great guys.  Colin's cousin, yeah.  Yeah, yeah,  and you wonder,  why didn't he make it  like the other Long Island guys?  Great Irish storytelling  and Mick Thomas.  Dee Snider's son  is doing six to eight minutes set  which means Dee will be there  with family  which is always cool.  Is he just starting?  He's been, you know,  dabbling.  He's been dabbling  for a couple of years  but I'm...  How old is his kid?  He's mid-twenties now.  Oh, okay.  Mid-twenties.  But I'm, yeah,  I'm happy with the way  things are going.  Yeah, it's...  Mick is, you know,  I've seen him hold an audience  in the palm of his hand  for 90 minutes 
[03:15:30]  and as you know, Jim,  it's like,  for a guy that's been doing it  for four years,  that's remarkable.  And as a comic as well,  you go out of your way  to live a ridiculous life.  Like you've got a jury duty  on, you know,  in case something funny happens.  And he's already lived  the most bizarre life  and his stories are so compelling  and it's just...  I'm hoping that at some point,  you know,  Norton and the comics  will be together  and be like,  that damn fool he's had  too many advantages  with that warped,  dysfunctional family  at WWE. 
[03:16:00]  You know,  I tried this one story  and I know it'll work.  Maybe you guys help me  polish it up  and I missed it.  The applause line was,  I was talking about  the rate of teenage pregnancy  dropping by 29%  like over the last decade  and the powers of B  trying to explain it away  by saying that,  you know,  sex education  has been more influential,  people are listening  and I'm like,  A,  people are wanking it  more often  and B,  I think through 
[03:16:30]  constant repetition,  teenagers really don't know  how the impregnation process  takes place,  you know.  So I'd say,  I like picture this girl  going to a fertility clinic.  I don't get it,  Doc,  you know,  it came twice in my boobs,  once in my butt  and three times in my face  and nothing.  And he says,  well,  you know,  she's going to have to  climax inside of you  and she gets his face  and goes,  won't I just poop it out?  Oh,  shit.  Do you say poop?  Poop it out,  yeah.  That might be the hard part.  I said,  shit. 
[03:17:00]  Well,  I said,  here was the line,  I stepped up.  I said,  I talked to a group  of 100 derelict  sex perverts,  you know,  addicts,  this and that,  blah,  blah,  blah.  And after I finished  talking to the guys  in the WWE dressing room  and I stumbled on WWE  and I was like,  ah,  damn,  damn,  I had that,  I had it.  You told me,  record everything I do,  I haven't been doing that  and if I mess up one time,  I don't go back to it.  Yeah,  but if you do good,  you're not going to know  why you did good.  You may have a line work  and not know why it works 
[03:17:30]  and you just keep trying  to capture the aliveness of it  and it never comes back  and if you can't watch it,  euphemisms are rough too.  It's hard because,  not that you want to be  overly dirty,  but if you're basically  saying someone's  shitting out cum,  you don't have to say it  like that vulgar.  How do I,  okay,  but how do I say it?  How do I polish that up?  You might want to say  shitting it out,  not necessarily cum,  but,  but how do I say it  not as erotically as you?  Listen,  with all due respect,  doesn't it,  isn't the contrast 
[03:18:00]  between the innocent way  of saying it  and the foulness  of the act  she's describing?  Possibly can be funny.  I personally,  you know what,  that is a line of thinking  that's valid.  It wasn't here.  But I hate,  but again,  that's a valid thought  because some guys  think it's funnier  to skirt that line.  I never find anything  where you're restricted  to be more enjoyable.  But this is my thought.  All right,  when I,  and it's weird  because in Long Island,  I'll go on after Brendan  and he'll go on  in Montreal, 
[03:18:30]  the big shows,  he'll go on  and the idea is to build  towards Montreal.  Before we go out  to WWE,  the last thing you see  is a sign that says,  stay away from  Spanish announce table  because your main event  guys may want  to go through that table.  And so,  you know,  when Brendan goes out there,  I want him to have  the liberty,  if he wants,  to take out that table.  You know what I mean?  And this is what,  like if I was privileged  enough to do a show  with you,  and I mean that,  and I would love 
[03:19:00]  to do it and open for you,  I would stay away from,  I mean,  I try to drop  one or two F-bombs,  you know,  and use them  in a powerful action  verb sense.  Make them count.  Make them count.  And then the floor's open,  you know,  for the guy  who's really good at that.  What does that happen here?  Do comics ask,  look,  stay away,  you know,  eating pussy's my territory.  I don't,  I'll ask,  I never tell people  what to do,  but if I'm working  with somebody,  you prefer,  like when Sandusky  was happening,  I had 15 minutes on it,  you prefer if the guy  before you isn't doing, 
[03:19:30]  I'll ask him,  are you doing anything  on Sandusky?  And if they are,  I'll have to avoid it.  Like I won't tell them.  You won't say,  hey man,  that's kind of.  Nah,  I mean,  there's a way to do it.  But out of respect,  shouldn't the guys  who were opening up for you  ask you,  hey.  You just pick and choose  who works with you  because I was warming up  for a special.  I had to work on the material.  Well,  that's fair enough.  I've seen you guys  work with each other.  You can do it,  sure.  If the guy's open to it,  you know you can ask him  and you can work with him.  That's the way she works.  I mean,  that's in the,  you know,  that's the courtesy of wrestling.  It depends on the comic  and what kind of relationship  you got with him,  I think.  Exactly.  If the bit doesn't stand 
[03:20:00]  on its own,  then it ain't that strong.  Right.  Well,  any bit though,  like when you talk about,  like,  there's only so many ways  you can go on a bit.  Like,  if you're talking about  Paterno and how he knew,  no matter how two comedians  do it,  one comedian talking about  Paterno knew,  the second guy's joke  may be stronger,  but you've already,  you've already heard it.  It just loses something.  But again,  your joke does have to  stand on its own too.  But I won't ever tell a guy  you can't do that ever.  You can't,  you can't tell comedians.  I just work with guys  that I know are different than me. 
[03:20:30]  Like Amy Schumer,  I worked with a long time,  but she's,  she's too strong and open now,  but she's totally different than me  and she would destroy.  Like,  you want people who kill  and are the opposite,  whatever that is.  I agree.  I agree.  If Tim's our MC,  and that's like,  you know,  and art,  because then when Brendan goes on  and he kills,  we'll get that five minute  transition period  where I'm not expected  to come up  and match that energy.  Continue that energy.  I think he's building it up too much  because I've never done  this stuff before.  I've only done it  at Mick Foley guest spots.  And it's funny,  he wants it like, 
[03:21:00]  he's going like,  I want people that don't like wrestling  to enjoy the show.  I don't.  I don't at all.  We're ostracized enough,  aren't we, Sam?  Exactly.  We're fucking lepers out there.  But there's always like  two or three women  who come with their boyfriends  and I want them to enjoy it too.  Yeah.  Is that the wrong way to look at it?  Should I be worried about that other 99 point?  Just worry about your material.  Okay.  Yeah.  And they'll come.  Plenty of strengths as well.  Always plenty of strengths.  I've seen enough shows.  You can't overthink that shit.  That's true.  Just worry about your material  and what you believe in.  Thanks, Opie. 
[03:21:30]  Mick Foley and Brendan Burns.  You guys are going to continue with Sam.  We've got to go though, for real.  Thanks for having us on.  Especially short notice, man.  Yeah, but Sam will continue  if you want to stick around.  It was a pleasure meeting you finally.  We're doing radio with you.  We met at Patrice's thing.  Yeah, thanks, man.  Horrible, horrible day for everyone.  I know.  You've got to come back  and do more radio with us.  I would love to.  Whenever I'm in New York,  that'd be great.  If you come to Montreal,  I really want to introduce you  to some guys that I know you love.  What days are you guys  going to be up there?  25, 27, and 28.  All right, that's when I'll be up there.  When is your show?  Because we're doing midnight. 
[03:22:00]  I don't know.  I think I'm doing something on the 26th.  I don't even know who else is on the show  besides Amy and Saget's hosting it.  We got that day off, right?  Yeah, I've got to work on my gala spot, I think.  But still.  I did like the gala.  I did it last year.  I only did one gala.  I don't love Montreal.  I don't hate it.  It was a fun city,  but they don't love me up there.  I do okay.  I don't destroy.  Really?  Nah, I do okay.  Wait, we did our first Montreal together.  Then we were on fire.  Good luck, Sam.  Thank you, buddy.  It took me a long time  to get into Montreal.  Godspeed.  See you, buddy. 
[03:22:30]  Cheers, guys.  That's hilarious.  It's now the after show.  These guys leave their show.  It's now the after show.  Well, it's the after show now.  You guys ruined it out of 10.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they stayed 15 extra minutes.  We run out of here.  Because I must admit,  most of the interview,  they're putting bags on their back.  Now they're leaving their show  and us here.  Dueling Vinces.  Dueling Vinces.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to go, too, in a second.  Yeah, no, Montreal's okay.  I enjoy it. 
[03:23:00]  I'm looking forward to this  because I love Bob  and I love Amy, you know.  Since it's Sam's show,  we don't have to worry  about maintaining the ratings.  Not at all.  It's shop talk.  I mean, that's what I love.  I love the similarities  between wrestling and comedy.  Oh, they're so relatable.  So relatable.  And to hear, you know what?  I mean, I watched The Voice.  I got hooked on The Voice this year.  And I couldn't help but think  that Christina made some choices  based on some odd choices.  And I was doing some thinking. 
[03:23:30]  I think, I don't think she likes  to have someone question her advice  or not utilize exactly what she said.  because she let go of the one guy  who seemed like he had the thing  almost wrapped up.  And I think, you know,  I'm lucky I've been wrestling  for 27 years.  And over the course of time,  you learn to filter out.  You learn to take in everything,  kind of decipher it,  filter out what works for you.  Oh, yeah.  And then you put it together  because, you know,  in wrestling and in comedy,  you've got a lot of people  telling you great advice, 
[03:24:00]  but nothing works for everybody.  Great advice, but not for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I love when I come on  and I can see your eyes,  you know, light up  when you talk shop.  It's this craft, you know.  It's this,  I talked to Judah for hours about it.  Yeah.  And then Brendan and I  were up last night  and I think the other comics,  when they see that I come in  and really want to learn  and be better at it  and have the respect for it.  Because I've heard there are guys  who come in who are actors  and they're just there 
[03:24:30]  to kill some time  so they can sell their stuff  at the end of the show.  Yeah.  And that might work for them,  but that seems like a dead end,  you know.  I mean, I go out there  and I get the same,  some people are like,  there was an article in Las Vegas  that said,  the man who once played  to tens of thousands  now plays to tens of tens.  It's like,  ooh, ouch.  And I was like,  first of all,  there were a couple hundred people there.  They were just scattered  through a 3,500 seat theater.  No, but not in that.  Were they really?  The people who originally 
[03:25:00]  took a chance on booking me,  and I'll give them a lot of credit  for even taking a chance,  they got really enthusiastic  when we did really well  at the improv in Hollywood,  but that's a couple hundred people.  And then they started booking  two and 3,000 seaters.  But you're not going to get any good  learning in front of that crowd.  No.  You're not going to,  you find out who you are  in front of a hundred people.  They put you in front of  how big of a room?  This is,  I went,  I did a show,  improv 200,  and the next five theaters  ranged from 1,500 to 3,500,  always with an audience  of 100.  400 people in Vegas is good, 
[03:25:30]  but not when you're playing  the same theater  that Elvis Presley played  and the VIP people  are on the side of the stage.  Tell them about Belfast.  After we gigged together,  he tells me like,  he said it was like,  the London gig was the greatest,  you know,  gig he'd had.  And his timing  and his pitch perfect  and I'll say as well,  like mixed strength is,  sometimes people come  from another industry  and they go,  I'll give stand-up a go  because I've always been  kind of funny in my industry.  But then they try  and become a stand-up comic  and that takes 10 years. 
[03:26:00]  Right.  Whereas like,  there's a friend of mine,  Paul Byrne,  who's a director  of stand-up shows  and he was asked  to work with Ben Dover,  the former porn star.  I loved his stuff.  It was very organic  and he sounded like  he was really,  really picking up girls.  That was after my friend  Paul Byrne worked with him  because originally  he wanted to do like  this Northern Working Men's Club  kind of,  my wife, right?  And he's going,  what the fuck are you doing?  You've lived a...  He wanted to do  the William Regal.  Not like it's porn.  I never saw it.  He's a man.  I know it's porn.  Yeah, all right.  That's right. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, I couldn't tell  when you were saying  I thought he was really  picking up girls.  No, they got porn.  I knew you were talking  because when you said  I loved his stuff,  I was like,  are you fucking retarded?  Yeah, I don't care  about his act.  I thought he was really  picking up girls.  He's good, yeah.  He's a good actor.  Great porn guy.  I think actually Jeffrey's  even talked about Paul Byrne  on the show before.  He was the Irish guy  that got like diagnosed  with a dicky liver  and they said,  you've got to stop drinking  and he was like,  well, it's been a good evening  but he's sober now  and everything.  Byrne, you were just  in the middle of telling me 
[03:27:00]  what my strengths were  so I could find out.  Oh, you were hanging  on that, weren't you?  So he plays to his strength  that rather than trying to,  like, bits will come  but the fact of the matter is  you've already lived  a preposterous life  and he really knows  how to tell these  really amazing,  compelling stories  that any fan wants to hear.  Like, you know,  you get thrown off  the top of it.  I saw the cage  at WrestleMania as well.  Is that taller  than the one you...  They've actually put  a couple feet on it  and I don't think  anyone will ever  come off the top of it again.  I'm really glad that 
[03:27:30]  when I read Jericho's book,  he talked about  how he was thinking of it  and he mentioned specifically  that he got up there  and people looked  like ants below  and I was like,  you can't fully appreciate  how ridiculously high  that was  unless you've been up there.  So I'm glad  he pointed it out.  One thing to remember  when you're performing,  stand-up,  and I've never seen your act,  is like,  people ask what's the difference  between stand-up  and writing or radio.  We get to meander more here.  Like, when you're on radio,  we talk, we chat,  there's no pressure  to immediately be funny.  Stand-up, 
[03:28:00]  they give you  a certain amount of leeway.  Like, Charlie Murphy  tells stories,  but you do have to get  to the point.  I'm not saying you don't.  I've never seen your act.  But that's one bit of advice  I would give anybody performing.  Get to the point  faster with stand-up.  They probably give more leeway  to somebody that they know, too.  They will,  but they still,  if they're going to a comedy show,  because what happens is  if you get them into a place  where it's only talk,  then there's going to be  no cadence or rhythm  and they're not going to,  they're not going to think 
[03:28:30]  it's a funny show.  And I think I've learned  to meld them  where I can get to the point  pretty quick.  Sure.  Get enough laughs,  but I'm not worried about,  like, I saw I Am Comic,  the documentary,  and they had the guy  doing the laugh,  they hooked up  to the laugh meter,  and I thought,  that's almost like  laughs per minute.  That's funny in a jar bullshit.  And that would be like  having a pop meter  in a wrestling match.  And it was a great match  because people were popping,  but at the end of the show  they had no recollection.  A laugh meter?  A laugh meter, yeah. 
[03:29:00]  I Am Comic,  it was a guy  who'd written and performed  and been fairly big,  he was trying to make a comeback  and thought his stuff  was a lot funnier than it was.  What was his name?  I can't remember.  See, I would be worried  about the cadence thing  because then after a while  I would be almost,  like, sometimes I will go along  where someone has hypnotized  an audience  and I sometimes think,  like, you're not really  listening to what he's saying,  you're laughing at rhythm.  Right, yeah, no,  you don't want to hear quite a...  Like, you don't do it,  I've seen you,  but that's a trick  that some guys adopt 
[03:29:30]  and I'm, like, going,  wow, this isn't actually that funny.  It is different between  the UK and the US scene  is UK's people  are far more used to storytelling  and people constructing  a narrative arc  over the course of an hour  with the festivals and everything.  When you watch Pryor,  like, Pryor,  he had a definite cadence  and he had a rhythm  to his speech.  You don't want to be  caught in a predictable pattern.  Like, you know,  but the thing,  I mean, Stephen Wright kind of was  and it worked for him,  but you don't,  that's a rare case.  But even a guy like Pryor  who told stories or Carlin, 
[03:30:00]  these guys had a cadence  and a rhythm that was,  it was almost like  you consent when somebody  is going somewhere  with something.  Like, you could tell  they were leading up  to something funny  even when the moment  wasn't funny.  But you don't want to get  caught up in a place  where it's just so conversational  where people never feel  like you're leading up  to anything  because then they're never going to,  they're eventually going  to not expect it to be funny.  It's a really weird line  you have with an audience.  But you don't worry about that  when you're doing radio?  Like, you don't pay attention  to how long it's been  since you said...  Just care less. 
[03:30:30]  No, we'll talk 10 minutes  without being funny here  and it's very conversational.  One of the things I love,  we were saying about  Louis C.K.'s show  is that he doesn't feel  like he has to be funny  every minute.  Right.  You might realize  you've gone 15 minutes  without a laugh,  but then at that episode  where he's got  the dinner date  with Melissa Leo,  I mean,  when she punches him  in the jaw  and they're like,  get over here,  get that tongue up my ass.  It's like,  this is, you know,  it was worth waiting for.  Yeah, you can build  between the commercials 
[03:31:00]  as long as you're going.  But you have a lot  of confidence, too,  to think you can do that  without having a laugh track,  without having to get laughs  every, every...  Well, you have to learn  how to ride a silence  as well  of building a mood.  Well, it seems like  what Jim was saying  about just being yourself  and Opal is agreeing  with it, too.  It seems like Louis  has kind of perfected  the art of being comfortable  just doing what he likes.  And if you like it,  then you can also enjoy it.  In the 80s,  even in the 90s,  guys had to have  like almost that character  that they could do 
[03:31:30]  in three to...  What is the industry term?  The seven minutes,  whatever it is,  where you have to be...  Repulsive.  You have to be able  to do your entire set  so that everybody  can see what it is you do,  what your character is,  and they can describe it  in a line or two.  Is that how you were taught, Jim?  I did come up hearing that.  Like, I never...  I've got a great story on that.  Just put a pin on that.  In L.A., you'd go there  and they would want a seven minute...  I mean, like,  what happens is  the business is lazy.  And they see a guy  like Ray Romano  who just...  I mean, seven or six minutes 
[03:32:00]  is probably the standard  because that's what  a Tonight Show set  or Letterman set.  So Romano does his set  on Letterman.  He's just talking about  his life and who he is  and all of a sudden  it clicks  and this is what the show is.  Seinfeld, same thing.  He's the guy  who talks about nothing  but observate...  Whatever it is.  Yeah.  But you can't really  make yourself go  that's what I want to do.  It kind of has to happen  through who you really are  as a performer, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  On the seven minute thing.  There's a story  that every New Zealand  Kiwi comic knows. 
[03:32:30]  If you ever get  Rhys Darby  and ask him about it  is that there was a guy  on the open spot circuit  in New Zealand  that...  The open spot is  Open Mike.  Open Mike,  you recall here, right?  He used to always declare,  Mate, I've got the best  seven minutes in the world.  I've got the world's  greatest seven minutes.  And he was a proper prick  and everyone fucking hated him.  And they found themselves  on the road one time  which back in those days  in New Zealand  was a real rarity.  You never went on the road  to go and do a gig  out of town.  So Captain Seven Minutes  is going along with him.  He's going...  And the whole way there 
[03:33:00]  he's like bragging  to the headliner,  Mate, I've got the best  seven minutes of all time.  I've got the greatest  seven minutes.  Rah, rah, rah.  So anyway,  he goes up on stage  that night  and he fucking kills  with his seven minutes.  But he's killing so much  he stretches it to ten.  Right?  Uh-huh.  And he's so pleased  with himself.  He's then going  up the back of the room  bragging to everyone  at the bar  that will ever listen.  Like, so the headliner  is going,  Can you shut the fuck up, mate?  And he goes,  Mate, I've done my ten minutes.  Comedy's over.  So apparently 
[03:33:30]  he retired.  What?  He was like  once seven minutes  has gone to ten  in this guy's head.  He's like,  Funny's done.  There's no funny  left in the world.  I stretched seven to ten.  Because he did his ten minutes.  And apparently  he like got punched  in the head  and left on the way home.  And that was his  entire career.  That was his entire career.  I've seen guys like  in the UK  because they are brutal.  There's some rooms  that are real baptisms of fire  that they're renowned  for heckling.  Sure.  But the thing is  the hecklers want you to win.  I notice here  a heckler just wants  to fuck you up. 
[03:34:00]  Like it's a drunk girl  or it's someone  that just is jealous  of the attention, whatever.  It's aggressive sometimes, yeah.  Yeah, in the UK  it's considered a sport.  It wasn't Belfast.  It was Dublin.  Oh, that's right.  It's Dublin.  And you learn  this juggling act  especially for me  when honestly  part of the appeal  of going to my show  is the meet and greet.  Sure.  I don't know  when I'll ever get  to that point  where I can go back  and just say  no meet and greet  just a show, man.  Take it or leave it.  And I think a lot of people  at this point  would choose to leave it. 
[03:34:30]  You know, I mean  they're always  pleasantly surprised  but there's a juggling.  But you're famous  for something else.  Yeah.  Right.  But if you do  the meet and greet  afterward in the UK  then people are risking  missing their trains.  You do it ahead of time  they got the extra  two hours to drink  and you do the late show.  Remember, I didn't know  there was a difference  between an early show  and a late show.  Brendan did the  he did a show with me  in London.  The next day  I think he had to leave  we did an early show  and it felt great.  I mean, I went out  with those guys  the night before  this is the best time  I've ever had in comedy 
[03:35:00]  and 26 hours later  it's that show  plus the two hours  I go out there  and even when it's like  hey, how many of you here  you know  just show of hands  I'm getting about 25%  the audience participation  that I did  and I was like  what is different here?  And when I came back  they said  Steve Martin's book  starts with the statement  you know  why did I retire  from comedy  four words  or whatever it is  Friday night late show  and I was like  what is the difference  and they said  it's a huge difference  in the drinking  and the ability 
[03:35:30]  to catch subtlety  and they're tired  and they worked all week  the Friday night show  is the toughest one  but even that's become  an overrated horror show  it's not even that bad  it really  it depends  for me  it starts at midnight  for me a lot of times  the  oh that can be rougher  a midnight show is rough  sometimes the Saturday  early shows are rougher  for me  because  that's what you guys  all do don't you  on the road  you do an early  and a late  all weekend  I'll usually do  8 and 10.30  that makes sense  but sometimes  the Saturday early show  because they're nicer  and if it's a 7 o'clock  early show 
[03:36:00]  a lot of times  they're great crowds  but they don't  want it harsh  so I have trouble  on those  sometimes the Saturday  late shows  usually  no that Friday  is they could have  gone to see something else  I don't think  you're their first option  late show Friday  you're not saying that  specifically towards Norton  you're saying  yes the collective you  but no he's right  I think you're doing  yourself a disservice  here as well  as I have seen you  hold the crowd  in the palm of your hand  and it's also  it's you know  it's I've got to put  this in perspective  for you as well  it's like I'm as big  a wrestling fan  as you  really 
[03:36:30]  yeah and when you're  a big wrestling fan  other wrestling fans  become aware of you  like I'm not that famous  in the UK  but like Mick said  when I went on the  when I went on the show  people already knew  I was a wrestling fan  right  so it's kind of like  I'm a kind of known comic  well because people  can't believe that  there are like wrestling  fans in society  doing things  so can you imagine  from my perspective  meeting him on  on these grounds  it would be Jim like  say Ozzy Osbourne  decided that he wanted  to take up plumbing  and you happen to know  that you're a pretty  you know  pretty decent plumber  and he wants tips 
[03:37:00]  so it's it's  you know  I'm playing it cool here  but I'm really  like like I said  that mushroom thing  like I got sober  and all that  but I'm still not sure  the world's real  when you were saying  the thing about  in England  like hecklers being  it's a sport  it's a sport  how do the comics  feel about that though  because here  the greatest thing  when we were in Vegas  a couple weeks ago  we went and saw  Dice perform  I was there  within two minutes  in Vegas or at Dice?  I was in Vegas  I think I bumped into  Bobby Kelly on the  we went in for the fight  oh really?  yeah  oh wow  I'll carry on  Dice is performing 
[03:37:30]  two minutes into his set  somebody's piping up  he kicked him out of the room  two minutes  into his set  whenever I see  there's a famous story  of a guy called  Joey Lee from America  that came over to England  claiming that he had  all these deals  and everything going on  in the States  and he played  Reading Music Festival  right  and that's just  baying animals  and the crowd are  you know  brutal  the thing is  that theatre shows  they're respectful  or whatever  but there's  certain shows  there's like  the Late and Live  in Edinburgh  where it's renowned  for heckling  and it's a baptism 
[03:38:00]  of fire  and it's just  an accepted thing  that you just  go back and forth  and they're pretty good  it's not the usual  the hecklers are funny  but the comics  still do those places  certain comics do  other comics don't  it's playing to your strengths  whatever  but this guy  Joey Lee  he's at Reading Festival  and a mate of mine  Dave Haddingham  was on before him  and Dave had an  absolute killer set  but Joey  was one of those guys  that was under the impression  that everyone loved him  and we couldn't  fucking stand him  because he was always  he would do that thing  that the guys do here 
[03:38:30]  that we don't do  in the UK  of listing your credits  and it's a wink  it's a wink to the  if you tell a compere  or an MC  did you know this difference  because I read it  in his book  you don't give credits  and it makes you look  bad in front of the audience  because it's a wink  to the crowd  that the guy's a wanker  so the thing is  like if a comedian  likes you  like basically  if an American guy  comes in  and starts giving it  the big hoo-ha  the MC will go  anything you want me  to say about you  right  and it's a trick  because then he goes  tell him I done Letterman 
[03:39:00]  tell him I done Letterman  he's going yeah  good luck  them knowing  what the fuck  that means mate  how about if the comics  I always thought  if I had a British intro  it would be  it's his first time  in England  yes  you know what  I just met the guy  that's what I ask people  to say in the US  because it's on the flip side  it works negatively  in my  because people get  nationalistic  because if you start  listing my UK credits  first of all  no one gives a shit  second of all  the crowd starts  to get patriotic  and going  well fuck this guy  who does he think  he is coming here  they shut down on you  but in the UK  it's a bit of a trick 
[03:39:30]  and generally  if I like a guy  and he goes  can you tell him  to say this  and I go  I'm not going to do that  because you're a nice bloke  you're a nice bloke  and I  you know  obviously no one's told you yet  but that's a wink to the crowd  it would be in the wrestling  the wrestling version of that  would be the wrestling handshake  where guys  what's that  used to shake  you know  the guy said  yeah I'm one of the wrestlers  and he shook a guy's hand  and he had a real firm handshake  okay you're one of the wrestlers  because there was like  a secret  you know  handshake  just basically  a soft handshake  and in some areas 
[03:40:00]  it would be almost like  two fingers touching the palm  but I'll tell guys  I'll be like  if I like him  I'll say listen  nobody does that anymore  you know  if you go and put  two fingers in the undertaker's palm  your career is basically over  so it's like the  counter psychology  because you're just like a douche  trying to fit in  and he doesn't know  but that's hysterical  telling  telling other wrestlers  that a wrestler's handshake  is soft and limp  and what  the perfect environment  for you to  to get that wrong  because you'd have a guy  and they'd all come in  with the  you know  all the test of strength 
[03:40:30]  handshake  don't do that  yes you don't do that  but now it's  it all depends  where you're brought up  but I'll tell a guy  A  if you've got a great body  don't take your shirt off  until it's time to go  you know  you don't parade it around  when you're  if you're a new guy there  and walking around  he's A  almost everybody besides me  has a great body  and B  it's just like  I told one guy  I was like  two things you're doing wrong  you can't really walk around  with your shirt off  all the time  and  don't have the package  of Magnum XL condoms  visible  like  is that what he was doing 
[03:41:00]  they were visible  I was like  tuck those away  you weren't sitting there  impressed by this guy  you can't see it  through his fucking  wrestling trunks  you don't have to see the rubbers  see now I want to go to England  and I want to give  an obnoxiously long list  to the host  come to Layton Live  and do that  come to the Edinburgh Festival  I would like to  I'll bring you on  at Layton Live  I would like to give  a piece of paper  he's instructed me  to read this  fuck that  I will go  this guy is from  the US of A  he is the best comedian  in the world 
[03:41:30]  he's better than  all of you  he sells out  Madison  he owns  Madison Square  I would kind of  want them to  no I would want to  give you a paper  so they kind of  knew that it was  at my insistence  like you'd have to  like a scroll  like read it out  like this  just like a fucking  sheet of paper  yeah  I've heard that's  a real fuck you  to a comic  if they give you  credits  and I would never  you know  I forget what  comic told me  I've never  it's not a fuck you  it's a wind up  does that make sense  yeah yeah  it's a ball breaker  yeah a ball breaker  and you're letting  the crowd know  oh I've never told you  the Joey Lee story 
[03:42:00]  right from Reddingfest  so the Reddingfestival  so Joey Lee  is beforehand  he's going  hey Dave  you're my guy  they have no MC  at the Reddingfestival  it's a rock festival  Foo Fighters  ACDC  playing  people throw  you know  portabins  what's his name  guy that was in  the Matrix  Keanu Reeves  right  Keanu Reeves's band  famously got like  bottles of piss  thrown at them  and I think  someone said  a portaloo  a port  oh portapotty  yeah yeah  a portable toilet  someone threw that  to the stage  threw a full portapotty 
[03:42:30]  he passed it  full of shit  on the stage  how did they get it on  I don't know  they're resourceful  I guess so  so this is  so it's an animal audience  and the comedy gig is  you know  you either storm or die  and you can see  Doug Stanhope  being booed off  oh really  at Leeds  I think  and he's very funny  with it  because someone  throws a plastic  water bottle  and he goes  what kind of shit  generation  throws a plastic  bottle  so Joey  is doing that  thing  and he's already 
[03:43:00]  managed to rub up  the entire circuit  the wrong way  saying hey  I got a deal  with Letterman  I got a five  picture deal  whoa whoa whoa  and that's  what's his name  Joey Lee  is he American  yeah  oh I know Joey  yeah  you know who Joey Lee  oh I thought he was  a British guy  Joey Lee  and he's sitting  there announcing  he's in Florida  so yeah  Joey's going  hey  so he's talking  to Dave Hanningham  and he goes  hey Dave  look listen  you're my guy  right  because they have  no MC at Reading  so listen  I want you to  tell him I done  Letterman  tell him I done  Leonard  tell him I'm  the best comedian  you've ever seen 
[03:43:30]  and Dave is like  you want me to say that  and he's like  yeah yeah yeah  sure  and so Dave goes on  has a fine gig  he's got all his  weed stuff  he's lifting the roof  off the place  but he does  the sea bombiest  trick you can in  comedy  because he goes  alright folks  I gotta go now  so the crowd goes  no  no  and he goes  no no no  it's not like that  right  he goes  because this next  act right  he's done Letterman  who the fuck's that  he's done Leno  who's that  and he goes  he is the best comedian 
[03:44:00]  in the world  and he goes  he is from  the US  of A  like no one says  US of A  it's a wink  that's the awful way  to say it  that's the awful way  to say it  and he winks  at the crowd  and he goes  he actually physically  winked at the crowd  he physically winks  at the crowd  that wasn't enough  yeah yeah  he goes  he's from the US  of A  winks at the crowd  and goes  ladies and gentlemen  Joey Lee  Dave walks off the stage  he's not off stage  more than a minute  before Joey comes  Joey comes like 
[03:44:30]  fatting down the stairs  just stumbling  and they go  what are you doing  you've only been on a minute  and he goes  hey man  someone ran to the front  to flip me the bird  I can't play to that  and we're like  this is a room  that will throw  their feces at you  because they flipped them off  because someone  flipped them off  and it was like  good luck with Edinburgh  I know what I'd open up with though  I would just point out  all the funny expressions  oh you'd  oh  the differences  in the language  hey  you guys call cigarettes  fags 
[03:45:00]  I don't make a bummer fag off you  but I wouldn't even go  I wouldn't even say  I would just like  do the set up  and let the crowd figure it out  you know  I would do the smart stuff  right right right  fags  yeah  I'm not talking cigarettes  right  you know  you know  the thing is  that is actually  even  to hackily point that out  that's hack  that has been done  so much there now  as well  that even that  isn't there a way  to kind of gently  break that to Jim  that he just came up  with a great concept  no I'm just kidding  I've never performed  in English  I'm being kind of sarcastic 
[03:45:30]  I would never open with that  I was like it  I'm thinking man  I think that's probably  been done before  yeah  yeah  yeah I'm sure  it's the address  oh sorry  I took you at face face value  no no no  oh my god  that thing you said  about the two headed girls  you know what  you might have to leave again  which two headed girls  oh my god  this is why I'm kind of  petrified of your crowd  as well  because it's  because this show  is such a guilty pleasure  isn't it  make us holding 
[03:46:00]  his kids ears shut  and it was  I think it's what  really tuned me into it  it was like  oh I get it  you know those girls  in Australia  that had two heads  was that you  or Bob Kelly  I don't know  I don't even remember  the two stomachs  I'd say it was Bob  but it was something  about  you  you watched this whole  video of them  and then it was like  she's a two-headed bitch  she's this  she's that  and then you go  I bet she's on  double Facebook  was that not you 
[03:46:30]  I don't know  it might have been Bob  I don't even remember  how long ago was it  I don't know  because I don't know  what time  while you guys talk  I'm going to be  John C. Reilly  and Step Brothers  going  Brokerage and  McGuire's  Boats and Hose  there are four  giant shows  coming up  with Mick Foley  and Brendan Burns  it's Brokerage  in Baltimore  Belmore  I don't want people  going to Maryland  tonight  Beltamore  Maryland  Brokerage  in Belmore  tonight  McGuire's 
[03:47:00]  in Bohemia  tomorrow  Stone Harbor  Bar and Grill  in Jersey  on Friday  Bar and Grill  where are you  taking me Mick  does someone  win a t-shirt  if they finish  a steak  what's going on  mate  Jack's Ribbon  Ale House  in Long Branch  on Saturday  realmickfoley.com  and we got a show  Sunday  down there too  realmickfoley.com  is there a rodeo  cow in the corner  I'm a bit worried  now mate  oh can I plug 
[03:47:30]  something  yes please do  can I make a world  announcement of something  oh my god  that would be huge  I'm the first guy  in Europe  to do the  Louis CK  direct to download  thing  nice  my next special  is coming out  on Monday  for well  clapped through  Louis CK  really  for blazing  that trail  but no  so we didn't  have to pander  to anyone  who was involved  in the whole  process  I'm regretting  something now  in hindsight  because you said  in your special  that Louis said  to you as well 
[03:48:00]  about don't show  the crowd  no he just likes  it shot dark  I noticed that  on his special  because it's a pet  peeve of mine  as well  you don't need  the dumb  fucking audience  shots  oh look at the  guy  see they're laughing  it's okay  they're not a part  of the process  they're not needed  and I hate it  I love the fact  of mine you can't  see them  I don't know  whether it's  the other side  of that  is I'm kind  of hard of hearing  and I always  stand at the  very front of the  stage  and I address  a lot of people 
[03:48:30]  directly  that's different  if that's what  you do  if you talk  to the audience  or if you  address them  there's a difference  it's not only  you do crowd work  you gotta have  them lit  but it does  it's a matter  of preference  really  there was one  I used a plan  as well  so we had  to have a lot  of crowd  shots  because we  faked a racist  argument  at the end  of the show  it's such a  standard though  in comedy  specials  to go to  those audience  shots  until you  break it down  like that  you don't  really realize  how self-gratifying  and unnecessary  my special  had to be edited  like any shot 
[03:49:00]  had to be edited  from the reverse  because it's  pitch black  I almost wish  it was a little  more lit  because when I  walk out  you can't tell  there are people  there until  you can see  the shadows  they stood up  like oh okay  there is an audience  there it's not  just a soundtrack  going back to Dublin  when I fell on my arse  they say  did a bad show  tell the back story  as well  oh no it was  Belfast I was  warning you about  Belfast was the  last show on the tour  and everything  had been  seven out of nine 
[03:49:30]  I thought had gone  really good  let me couch this  with as well  Belfast Empire  famously if you're  an English act  you have to punch  someone in the head  you have to punch  someone in the head  every time I've done  the Belfast Empire  I've had to physically  take someone off the stage  and throw them down  the stairs  and then the crowd  goes  and then you've got  them in the palm  of your hand  it's violent  because Dublin  Dublin was hard  because it was the  first time they'd  ever done comedy  there  it was a high school  auditorium  that had last  housed Lords of the  Dance  for some visiting  Chinese dignitary 
[03:50:00]  like it was a very  esteemed high school  atmosphere  they'd never had  comedy there before  they didn't know  that you need to  talk to those  five or six guys  who were getting  out of hand  and I knew I had  my work cut out  for me when I saw  we did the two  hour meet and greet  and there were  five or six guys  who were really  sauced  who were yelling  out stuff  during the other  acts  and when I  mentioned to  our mate  Chris  I was like  maybe we could  just  they take the  interval  they take the  30 minute break  before the  I like to keep  that flow going  it's like wrestling  you don't take a  30 minute break  before the 
[03:50:30]  you can make  more liquor money  put this in  perspective  Irish audiences  will heckle  at a TV recording  at a TV recording  at a TV recording  like look it up  on YouTube  the Gay Burn  Gay Burn  that's his name  the late show  with Gay Burn  and he's having  some political  discussion  in the middle  of it  some drunk  Irish guy  comes up  and goes  let me tell you  something  Gay Burn  and I won't  tell you  he's on telly  he thinks  nothing of it  and my friend  Andrew Maxwell  who came in here  he used to do  a show called  The Panel  and it was him  Dar O'Brien 
[03:51:00]  and Ed Byrne  another three guys  you would love  and I know it  yeah yeah  and he  they would  constantly  because the panel  the show is  just the four of  them sitting around  a table  just talking about  anything  there's no format  so the thing is  because it's so  conversational  it's like this  that people in the  audience are going  that happened to me  I assumed you were  talking about  they will heckle  during comedy  TV tapings  you mean  any TV tapings  during comedy  and TV  just whatever's on  that like  they're so  kind of  they don't 
[03:51:30]  respect  anything  yeah  just assholes  I'd done two pubs  in Ireland  on a tour  before  and it was  loud  and it was  rowdy  and sometimes  they'd yell  stuff out  they're big  on yelling  out names  like if I  mention somebody's  name  then they  will yell  at that  name  and Brooker  he was our  compare  MC  he had a good  way  he was like  no  you know  just let it  out  we're going to  give you a minute  just let it  out  yell out your  random wrestling  names  so they wouldn't  be doing that  during my set 
[03:52:00]  but there was  no way  and I have  a heckler  proof method  of dealing  with hecklers  involving Kurt  Angle's  entrance music  you know  basically  play the  theme music  and hundreds  of people  chant you  suck  at the  offender  but A  it enables  them  sometimes  they feel  like they're  the star  of the show  and on this  night in  Dublin  I was like  hey let's  cue up that  piece of music  let's cue up  that piece of  music  and I'm looking  at Brooker  he's like  we don't  have it  and it was 
[03:52:30]  just like  it was  just  I do  know what  it's like  to be able  to hold  why didn't  you have  it  they just  didn't have  the sound  you shouldn't  be relying  on that  I know  you should  have it  but I have  held them  in the palm  of my hand  enough to know  what that feels  like it  so I know  when it's  not  you should  have it  on your  iPhone  and just  pulled it  out and  held it  into the  cord  I need  an iPhone  you've never  seen an audience  want to chant  a comic's name  more than at his  gigs  but the next  night  I was down  man  I was like  this is 
[03:53:00]  I'm ending  this thing  on a sour  note  and he's  telling me  about having  to punch  people in the  head  at the  empire  and I  went out  it's about  300 people  no I said  at least you  don't have to  play the  empire  tonight  and he  says  that's  where I'm  going  and I  told him  all the  empire  punching  in the  head  stories  and he  goes  that's  where I  am  and I'm  like  oh  it'll  be fine  do you want  some put  downs  how was it  I was  first of all  it was one of the top  five reactions I've received  anywhere when I came out  just like humbling  yeah  and then it was  I think  if the lights  there's four or five 
[03:53:30]  rowdy guys  if the lights had been on  like they were the night  before and I'd be able to  see the guys who were  giving me crap  I would have paid more  attention to them  and I at one point  I was talking about  the c-word  and the fact that  man you only say that  in the US  if you really want to  get your butt kicked  or break up with  somebody in a hurry  and I said here  you use it as a comma  and I said  I'm not able to do that  they started chanting me  for you to say the word  and I got up to the mic  and I went  can't  can't do it  can't do it  and then we went to the show 
[03:54:00]  and 20 minutes in  out of the darkness  somebody yells something out  and I just stopped  Huey earmuffs  put these on  cover yours  and I just looked  and I went  cunt  it was the first time  I never said it  and it was like boom  and I came off  it's freeing isn't it  it is  we actually have to go  we have a good time  schedule  we have a good time  it drops the c-bomb  yeah I love it  thank you guys for coming in  oh I did make my announcement  the thing with the download  you go to  www.brendonburns
