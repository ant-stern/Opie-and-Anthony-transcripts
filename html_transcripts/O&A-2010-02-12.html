<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with Opie and Anthony recounting their late nights.  This segued into a discussion about Japanese astronaut Astro Soichi, who was tweeting pictures from the International Space Station.  The hosts found his space tweets and the high-resolution images of Earth highly amusing, referring to him jokingly as a "space tweeter" and a "twitter whore."  They debated the challenges of identifying locations from space, particularly the invisibility of state lines in images of the United States.  The conversation then veered towards personal frustrations with cell phone service. One host described a successful customer service interaction that resulted in a $50 credit and an offer to upgrade to an unlimited data plan.  This prompted a comparison with older, more expensive plans, such as one costing $100 for only 2000 minutes, highlighting the dramatic shift to today's unlimited data options. No guests appeared in studio during this segment.
