<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a segment featuring the “Greece Man,” a recurring character who pitched racially insensitive crayons.  His act, featuring crayon names like “Chink Yellow” and “Wetback Brown,” led to his removal from the studio by CBS representatives.  The hosts then transitioned to discussing a picture of Stephanie McMahon's exposed breast from a SmackDown taping, anticipating Triple H's arrival and potential comments on the matter. They also mentioned upcoming guests Dennis Leary and Stephen Lynch, expressing anticipation for Lynch's new song while mocking a previous bowling-themed song they disliked.

A substantial portion of the show focused on the hosts’ office electrical problems, caused by numerous electronic devices, two beer refrigerators, a Jägermeister machine, and a new Snapple refrigerator.  They debated solutions, ultimately deciding to turn off a neon light.  The discussion included descriptions of their cluttered office space, filled with alcohol and unusual items,  and a hasty cleanup before their boss, Mel, arrived. Opie detailed the liquor and action figures in suggestive poses on his desk.

Triple H arrived in the studio, and the hosts resumed discussing the Stephanie McMahon incident and his reaction (or lack thereof).  They also discussed his WWE career, Hulk Hogan’s return, and other wrestlers.  Triple H addressed the situation professionally and briefly discussed his relationship with Stephanie.  The segment concluded with the announcement of phone calls and the implied presence of women invited to be spanked by Triple H.

An in-studio interview with Triple H ensued, alongside comedian Lewis Black, who frequently interrupted.  Topics included Black's Comedy Central special, film digitization, and anecdotes about *E.T.* and James Bond alterations.  The conversation shifted to Triple H's personal life, with jokes about attractive women and strippers. Lewis Black declined an invitation to meet strippers at 3 AM due to a prior commitment he found suspicious.  The hosts teased Triple H about spanking women, and three women from a strip club called VIPs were brought into the studio.  The attempt to have Triple H spank them was partially successful, with Candy partially disrobing and being spanked by Triple H and WWE publicist Mark Carano. This segment involved sexually suggestive comments from all involved. Phone calls included those from Jimmy Norton, Big V, and Chris Jericho (off-air).  More strippers were brought in, including "Stalker Patty," which visibly embarrassed Lewis Black, leading to their removal. Triple H promoted his Wrestlemania appearance and an event at the Continental Airlines Arena.  Dennis Leary's phone call ended this portion, discussing the show's work schedules and St. Patrick's Day in Southie.

A significant portion focused on Dennis Leary's new animated children's movie.  Callers Nate and Lewis provided reviews, with Nate highlighting a funny scene and Adam Ferrara's girlfriend's S&M antics, and Lewis expressing gratitude for the show's support regarding firefighter budget cuts.  Leary himself called in to promote his show, airing on ABC at 9:30 PM.  The conversation veered into a darkly humorous discussion about Mohammed Atta's visa application, terrorism, nuclear weapons, and potential targets.  Additional callers included Fred (commenting on Lewis Black’s video game humor), John (sharing a Florida Crystal Burgers commercial anecdote), and Martha (an angry caller insulting the hosts). Ozzy Osbourne called in, engaging in a humorous exchange with the hosts.  Finally, the segment transitioned to Stephen Lynch's upcoming shows, a comical exchange involving Opie, a 12-year-old boy named Gary, and Joey Paisano, leading into Lynch’s in-studio appearance.

The final segment featured Stephen Lynch performing songs including "She Got a Smile" and the infamous, lengthy "Almighty Malachi, the Bowling God."  The hosts reacted with varying levels of amusement and annoyance.  They discussed Lynch's upcoming performances.  Joey Paisano's presence in the lobby with a sign was mentioned.  The show concluded with the "What Did We Learn Today?" segment, featuring callers' takeaways and running gags involving the show’s timekeeper, Ben, all within a context of crude language and sexually suggestive humor.

[00:06:00]  that Stephanie  McMahon has  shown a lot  of body parts  and they taped  Smackdown last  night I think  in Cleveland  right  and the internet  went crazy  because Triple H  was giving her  the pedigree on  the broadcast  table  and she was in  position  next thing you  know the whole  boob popped out  right  that lovely  breast implant  just flew out  her brand new  big  now it's something  you're not going  to see on the  Smackdown broadcast  tomorrow  but people were  there with their  cameras and they 
[00:06:30]  already have shots  on the internet  oh they will not  show that  hell no  maybe they'll  cube it out  or something  yeah  so maybe we  can talk to  Triple H about  how he feels  you know  about his woman  in real life  that's his chick  that's really his  chick and he's  he's showing  everybody her  cans and her  ass  he's like  pulling her  pants up  and we saw  her ass  in that shot  yeah  very nice  Stephanie McMahon  Helmsley ass  and now her 
[00:07:00]  boob last night  on Smackdown  yes  Triple H is  coming in here  in 20 minutes  or so  we got him  for at least  an hour  then he's  going to go  over to  Conan O'Brien  and tape  that  oh is that  what he's  doing  I believe  he's going  to be on  tonight's  Conan O'Brien  going in  and we're  looking for  ladies to come  down  because last  time we had  Triple H  on the radio  he  he spanked  Peaches  nice  and yeah  kind of  raised some  blood vessels  on our butt  that was  nice  so if you're  a lady  and you're  in the area  come on  by and  we'll invite 
[00:07:30]  you down  so Triple H  can spank  you  right  I hope  he's still  allowed to  do that  I would  think so  he seems  to do  what the  hell he  wants  you know  he's  dating  the boss's  daughter  though  yeah  but he  was at  the time  also  wasn't  he  are we  going to  make  believe  we don't  know  that  when he  comes  in  like we  got to  play it  off  like the  storyline  no  he's a  freak of  nature  no  I mean  we've had  all the  guys in  here  yeah  Triple H  is ridiculous  how big  he is  he's really  huge  I don't know  if TV does  it justice  because he's  next to all 
[00:08:00]  the other  big guys  but he  pretty much  takes up  that whole  door  that whole  doorway  very big  guy  but not  the scariest  as far as  having in  here  Bubba Ray  Dudley  is  by far  the scariest  the scariest  to have  in here  well Triple H  you know  I mean  you can see  the smile  when he  sits down  Bubba Ray  the first time  we met him  we were scared  oh yeah  oh definitely  we can admit  that  like Triple H  knows I  better not  hit anybody  it's not  in my best  interest  Bubba Ray  Dudley  doesn't seem  to care 
[00:08:30]  like he  will punch  someone in  the face  and probably  he cares  enough to  make sure  you hit him  first though  yeah but  you know  something  that don't  that old  gag don't  work anyway  a lot of  celebrities need  that as they're  out though  yeah but  you know  something  you get sued  anyway  you know  what it is  I predict  this for  Bubba Ray  Dudley  he eventually  will hit  somebody so  hard it  will either  kill them  or paralyze  them and he  will be  destitute  because he  will have  to give  all of his  money away  to some  clown  that he  clocked  at a bar  or something  that's our  pal  I know 
[00:09:00]  I feel  I should  tell him  this but  I'm afraid  let's not  try to fool  anyone here  the guy's crazy  so stick around  for Triple H  that's always  a lot of fun  when he stops  by or calls  the show  so alright  yes  old Jimmy  Norton  in the studio  today as well  Jimmy's back  Stephen Lynch  stopping by  very good  he's got a  brand new  song Anthony  one a year  he puts out  I hear  so it'll be  good to hear  this annual  song from  Stephen Lynch  it's always  good he's 
[00:09:30]  never  never  disappointed  oh no he  had that one  song about  bowling  you didn't  like the  bowling one  we openly  told him  we were  like  I don't  know  in retrospect  I kind of  like the  bowling one  in that  it's quirky  his songs  are quirky  we have  never replayed  it Anthony  on our show  alright  I gotta agree  yes the  bowling thing  you know how  we like to  play bits  into the ground  over and over  again  let's see  transvestites  grandfathers  dying  killing animals  retard  Olympics  if I were 
[00:10:00]  gay  if I were  gay  and then  and then  bowling  yeah I guess  it doesn't  quite fit  but his  batting  average  is unbelievable  yeah  out of all  the songs  he's given  us and it's  gotta be a couple  dozen at this  point  yeah  only one  we haven't  replayed  the bowling  song  we might have  to pull that  out now and  play it  listen again  and maybe  I don't even  think we put it  on CD  where's Rick  cause now I need to  hear the bowling  now I kinda wanna  hear the bowling  see how stupid  this show is  and how it works  we talk about it  now I kinda wanna 
[00:10:30]  hear it  here's a song  we would  never replay  but now that  we're talking  about it  we gotta  play it  now I kinda  wanna hear  the bowling  song  from Stephen  Lynch  he's given us  two dozen  songs and  that's the  only one  where's Rick  Rick's not  around  alright  we'll see if  we can find  the bowling  song  no cause we  made a special  Stephen Lynch  CD  all the appearances  on our show  and all the songs  and I know  that one's not  on there  it's not on  there  no  Jesus  so  and Louis Black 
[00:11:00]  stopping by  it looks like  yes  and Louis  and we almost  didn't have a show  today cause we  couldn't show prep  in the back office  we would have  made something up  anyway but  but uh  the circuit breaker  keeps going out  on us  oh Rick  Rick's in here  what Rick  no no  there's no  bowling song  no come on  you gotta find it  you didn't find it  you know me  with the OCD  thing now I'm  gonna think bowling  song all day long  I know there's a  bowling song  that song sucks  so bad I think  I stopped the tape  no there's gotta 
[00:11:30]  be the bowling  we have it  somewhere  somewhere  I'm not gonna  look for it  I know it's not  on any of those  CDs  it's gotta be  at least a year  and a half ago  yeah  so it's gotta be  just on a dat  yeah  that ain't good  I'll take a look  is there any reason  you're wearing  30 pens around  your neck  cause I'm a total  dork  what is that  it really bugs me  cause as soon as  I put one down  people steal it  so I gotta wrap  them around my neck  that's a great  thing to do  alright you know  what  and you know  what we'll do  yeah  he's coming by  we'll have him  perform the bowling  song live 
[00:12:00]  god damn  alright  which is even  more uncomfortable  cause he knows  we don't like it  and when he finishes  we'll just sit here  all quiet  you wanna play it off  like we really liked it  and wanna hear it again  dude he listens to us  every day  yeah I know  well I'm hoping  maybe he's in the subway  or something  no he's on to us now  god damn it  just imagine  you know  when he plays the new one  how good it's gonna sound  though  oh see  he starts with the  low expectation song  exactly  then he gives us  the new song  and the new song  is gonna now  really rock  and then before you know it 
[00:12:30]  you're like  wow that's a great tune  compared to  the bowling song  listen to the reaction  we get from him  when we ask him  to perform the bowling song  he's gonna be like  shut up guys  I know what you're  talking about  no I was talking about  how we lost  the circuit breaker  yeah  this has been  happening a lot  our office is  days away from  burning up  yeah  we're having trouble  with the circuit breaker  we finally threw the fan out  that was about to go in flames 
[00:13:00]  well that thing was ridiculous  because  I don't know  the people that  share the office with Ant and I  have decided that  you know  we need a fan going  24-7  for months at a time  well  the thing has so much  dust and dirt  and crap on it  that it barely goes around anymore  but they insist on keeping it on  mm-hmm  this  yeah the fan was ridiculous  we finally threw that out today  and Stinky's like  but we're gonna  be sorry  when it gets hot out  I'm like  we'll get another one  that's a month and a half away 
[00:13:30]  it's an air conditioner  yeah maybe we'll upgrade  and get a nice  AC unit for the office  whatever  I think we can afford  an AC unit  at this point in our careers  yeah  so uh  we got rid of the fan  but now um  now what's the problem  is it the Snapple fridge  here it is  here's the problem  because I'm thinking  what have we added  to the office  that is effing up  all our uh  exactly  circuit breakers  all of us have computers  at our desks  we have five computers  in our office  there are five computers  we went over this one time  before right  all the crap we have 
[00:14:00]  in our office  uh  and then we  we got a  a small refrigerator  dude hold on  yeah  hold on  help me out here  uh huh  just list all the stuff  we have in our office  okay  we only have like  four plugs  I was gonna talk about  this is the key to the story  the thing is though  uh we got the five computers  but uh we also have  two television sets  right  uh two vcrs  right  cable box running  you know the tvs  the xbox  the uh xbox  when someone's not  stealing that  we've had three xboxes  stolen from our office  by the way 
[00:14:30]  my my sound system  it's not stolen  they're stolen  because they're not  there anymore  it was um  taken  thank you  whatever  go find the bowling song  jesus  and the sound  the uh my speakers  yeah  for my computer  is plugged in separately too  because i got this huge subwoofer  and i need you know  dude primo sound  your computer is ridiculous  i know  my monitor  you turn it on  and the lights  down the hall  start flickering  i got a huge monitor 
[00:15:00]  what the hell do you got  going on in the back office  i think  gaming  i think you're landing planes  at this point  gaming  from your desk  then we decided  we needed  a place to put the beer  so we got  a refrigerator  one of those small  two foot by two foot  refrigerators  which quickly  uh we realized  we needed another  two foot by two foot  fridge  you're effing up the story  for food  you're effing up the story  what  the first fridge  officially was for food  right  but we all knew  but then uh  the beer took over 
[00:15:30]  our food fridge  uh huh  which uh  no one really had a problem with  but then a lot of people  bringing stuff in  that needed to be refrigerated  so we're like  who was bringing stuff in  that needed to be refrigerated  about all of us  as far as food  mostly me  just opie  no rick and other people  the yogurt  was rick bringing stuff  oh yeah  shut up ben  whatever ben  oh  call me a fag  because i bring stuff  that needs to be refrigerated  it's just that  one fridge 
[00:16:00]  why do you single me out  because all i'm saying  is one of those  refrigerators  dedicated to just one  or even if it's rick  bringing a yogurt  just one person's  food  is a ridiculous waste  of refrigeration space  right  okay  so that quickly turned  into the second beer fridge  right  and then opie would get  very angry sometimes  when uh  he would see something  he put in there  as far as a food product  on top of the refrigerator  because someone had taken it out  to make room for  more beer  no more beer  so i would have to sacrifice 
[00:16:30]  you know  uh  i don't know  mid-show snacks  right  and lunch  whatever  call me a puss  but the point i'm making  it is ridiculous  because there was  so much beer  um  stuffed into the  into the refrigerator  already  yeah  why would you have  to take all the food  out put it on top  of the fridge  to put more beer in  to keep it  when there was plenty  of beer for the show  to start it cooling up  because the beer  in the one fridge  is going to be gone  so fast  that we already need  a head start  on new cold beer  so we solved that problem  by getting another 
[00:17:00]  refrigerator  right  now we have  two refrigerators  dedicated to  sam adams beer  and believe me  the breaker we have  for this office  is not some  you know  huge  amperage breaker  very very low amps  and it trips a lot  so now  what i  what i uh  suggest here  is that we get rid  of one of the refrigerators  because the whole food  thing is still a problem  uh huh  there's still no place  to put food  right  now we have  two  refrigerators  packed with beer 
[00:17:30]  right  so i think we need  to get rid of  one of our  refrigerators  well  this is what  we were working on  you forgot this also  another important  refrigeration device  that is inside  that has been  uh  the focus  of a lot of  controversy  the past couple  of days  since the break  has been tripping  this is  the frozen  Jägermeister machine  behind the door  is a  if you've ever  been to a lot  of bars  uh  you can get  shots of  chilled  Jägermeister  it's a  device  it has  three bottles 
[00:18:00]  of Jäger  you put in the  top  and a little  tap  sticking out  the front  and it comes  out like  zero degrees  icy cold  shots of Jäger  so people are  starting to ask  hey  should we  unplug the Jäger  machine  we barely  use it  this is a  device that  it doesn't  matter how  often you  use it  when you do  use it  it needs  to be on  and cold  I know  I know  that there  are weekends  Steve  still  back  me up  on this  just last  weekend  we were  pouring out  the shots  of icy  Jäger  don't you 
[00:18:30]  dare  unplug  that  no  and I  said  no  we need  the icy  Jäger  machine  why do you  guys hang  out in the  office on  weekends  it's fun  man  it's just  the guys  hanging out  drinking  and we  talk  and there's  a frozen  Jäger  machine  frozen Jäger  and beers  in there  it's like  a bar  even the  old English  800 neon  light gives  a great feel  to the place  there's porno  on the  computers  you know  how much  electricity  that freaking  old English  800 neon  light is  taking off  yeah we  have a  full huge  old English  800 neon  light  that hasn't 
[00:19:00]  been unplugged  man when we  start our day  and just flick  the lights  for our  office  you can just  see the  meter going  oh it looks  like someone's  getting it up  on a C block  you know  we lost  another one  alright so  then we got  the Jägermeister  chilling machine  yeah  now the latest  addition to the  office and this  is what put it  over the top  is our latest  sponsor  the fine  fine folks  from Snapple  beverages  the wonderful  Snapple family  of beverages 
[00:19:30]  that's right people  Snapple advertising  with the opening  and the  Snapple  our new  bestest friends  we're gonna be  bringing them  back from the  dead  they have brought  a huge  refrigerator  that you would  see in a  small to  mid-sized  deli maybe  you get these  little fridges  that you can  go into  and grab  an icy  cold  Snapple  I don't know  that looks  like about  almost 4 feet  high  yeah  yeah  we could  see it  on a  counter  somewhere  maybe  you know  a big  pretty big  fridge  now that  thing's 
[00:20:00]  stuffed  with  Snapple  and if I  may say  some extra  beer that  couldn't fit  in the  other two  refrigerators  now we  are horrid  now the  beer problem  is making  its way to  the Snapple  fridge  then how much  do we love  our beer  back there  we love  our beer  the beer  in our  office is  like a  disease  it really  is  and the  beer that  we can't  fit in the  fridge  is in the  case box  is still  stacked up  waiting to  be put in  the fridge  but this  finally put  it over  the top  where now  we're sitting 
[00:20:30]  there  at any  minute  we hear  and the  office goes  dark  it's just  we're sitting  there all  of a sudden  you hear it  power down  power down  three times  this week  it happened  Monday morning  then it  happened  last night  it happened  last night  and get  this  I was  and people  that play  the game  know  I play  EverQuest  like I'm  addicted to  crack with  the game  and if I  engage in  battle  online  and the  power goes  out  I don't see

[00:23:30]  day  don't even  sugarcoat it  Mel came  here  that's what  it was  he came  here  I guess  Ken  heard that  Mel was  on his  way up  and came  running into  the office  in a state  of panic  or something  I wasn't  here for  this  I wasn't  either  all I know  is I got  to work  and I  didn't see  one beer  bottle  here's  what  Ken  had to  say  and you  know  something  you would  never  think  your  boss  would  have  to  say  hide  the  booze  hide  the  booze  all I  kept  thinking  is  Mel  walking  in there 
[00:24:00]  and that  scene  from  Animal House  when  Dean  Wormer  walked  into  Delta  House  and hear  the clinks  of all  the bottles  well  well  looks  like  somebody  forgot  there's  a rule  against  alcoholic  beverages  in  fraternities  on  probation  really  Dean  Wormer  clink  clink  clink  clink  so  did  Ken  come  in  in  a  panic  what  a  tool  came  in  and  he  was  like  hide  everything  clean  this  place  up  Mel's  going to  be here  in a couple  minutes  so  we just  hid  everything  we cleaned  that office  was pretty  nice  and you  had to  open the 
[00:24:30]  door  all the  way  to hide  the  Jager  machine  behind  the  door  because  we  couldn't  move  that  and  then  they  draped  something  over  our  porno  collection  that's  more  amazing  than  all the  videos  in  Blockbuster  oh  please  you go  into  I  defy  you  walking  into  the  sleaziest  porno  store  you can  find  and you  tell me  it's a  better  collection  of  smut  and  awful  awful  pornography  than we  have  in our  office  we have  hundreds  of  tapes  ain't  gonna  happen  my  desk  alone  is  pretty 
[00:25:00]  hysterical  I  walked  in  after  I  heard  he  had  made  a  visit  and  I  looked  at  my  desk  I  hope  he  doesn't  think  it's  my  desk  there's  a  bottle  of  whiskey  open  half  full  sitting  on my  desk  underneath  there's  bottles  of  Captain  Morgan  I'll  count  them  down  Captain  Morgan  Sky  Vodka  Absolute  Vodka  I got  some  other  kind  of  vodka  lemon  flavored  stuff  Jack  Daniels  I got  some 
[00:25:30]  champagne  there's  an  entire  liquor  collection  around  my  desk  Frenchy's  Chimay  that he  brought  by  Frenchy's  Chimay  and  on  top  of  my  desk  in  plain  view  is  an  application  for  a  pistol  permit  which  is  just  laying  out  with  various  video  games  like  Half-Life  and  Medal  of  Honor  and  other  shoot  them  ups  not  counting  the  Barbie  doll  that  you  have  giving  blank  to  the  cripple  Barbie  doll  are  you  insane  I  have  my  Arlie  Erme  sergeant 
[00:26:00]  okay  that's  what  it was  my  sergeant  Arlie  Erme  doll  sitting  on  my  monitor  he  is  in  a  threesome  he  is  using  his  digits  on  one  of  the  Olsen  twin  dolls  as  her  head  is  in  the  doll's  lap  and  with  the  other  hand  he  is  doing  some  digits  with  the  other  Olsen  twin  doll  that  is  doing  the  Y  pose  with  the  feet  just  sticking  in  the  air  and  the  one  legged  crippled  Barbie  in  the  wheelchair  is  watching  toying  with  herself  that  is  on  top  of 
[00:26:30]  my  desk  but  all  I'm  thinking  is  ah  so  he's  gotta  walk  in  and  see  this  display  you  don't  think  he  knows  that  you're  both  alcoholic  pigs  that's  the  news  hey  Mike  what's  going  on  hey  guys  you  gotta  break  down  and  get  a  full  sized  fridge  man  yeah  you  know  we  might  be  to  that  point  where  we  need  a  full  I  need  the  Ozzy  Osbourne  refrigerator  you  see  the  problem  is  you  got  three  compressors  kicking  at  a  time  and  if  they  kick  in  at  the  same 
[00:27:00]  time  we're  screwed  but  the  problem  is  we'll  never  solve  the  problem  matter  how  big  of a  fridge  we  get  it'll  never  be  big  enough  because  then  it's  like  oh  hey  the  16  cases  that  just  arrived  why  don't  we  refrigerate  all  of  them  well  you can  start  taking  pigs  in  the  fridge  and  then  you  know  a  couple  cases  will  be  missing  and  it's  going  to  feel  like  it's  an  empty  fridge  that's  true  we're  going to be  sending out interns  to cover the  spaces  you're right  but then you can  just put the  Jager in the  freezer  right  alright Mike  have a good one 
[00:27:30]  thank you  alright we better  take a break  so there's no  solution  there really  there's got to be  a solution  somewhere  did we  unplug the  second fridge  now since  I think  what we did  today because  we unplugged  one fridge  and it's  still tripped  today  so we  unplugged  the second  fridge  stinky  did we  so both  fridges are  down  Jager machine  still online  wait my  mid-show  yogurt's in  there  put it in  the  snapple  fridge  that's why

[00:28:30]  to the  back office  and click  off the  old English  800 neon  light  I do  believe  that is  a high  voltage  unit  that could  really be  sapping  some power  that gave  our office  a little  character  I know  it did  but we  got it  we got  we all  have to  pitch in  and conserve  someday when they  replace the breaker  we can bring it  all back  we'll have a  goddamn carousel  in the middle  of the floor  for god's sake  snow cone  and cotton candy  machines  but for right  now click 
[00:29:00]  off the old  English 800  light  we have to  do  what  we've been  too nice  to Ken  Stevens  take his  office  well it's  in our  contract that  we get our  own studio  first of all  and we've  kind of blown  that off  for now  because we're  not that pompous  but the other  thing is we want  that wall  removed  and we want  to take over  Earl's area  that's what  we wanted to  do  Earl has  more circuit  breakers  it's Earl  and what  the intern's  cubicle  John Rossi  who's cool  so he can  just be part  of the  environment  who cares  oh like  he'll get  a desk  in there  or something  who cares  and then 
[00:29:30]  before you know  it  we're saying  we've got  to break  down the  other wall  into Jeremy  that's  right  well he's  not going  to have  use  for it  too much  longer  nah  he could  bunk with  Ken  that's right  he could  bunk with  Ken  over in  Ken's  office  get some  of your  friends  maybe  their  own  desk  and then  we could  put one  of those  hotel  doors  that  there's  a door  on each  in each  room  to go  in between  our office  and Ron  and Fez's  office  so for  party nights  Friday night  party nights  we open 
[00:30:00]  the doors  and have  a big  party thing  going on  you know  they do  that  they have  Friday night  lights out  parties  in this  place  now  because of  the day  they turned  the power  off in  here  and there  was a  huge  party  we came  walking  stumbling  in after  a movie  and it's  like the  lights are  all out  and they're  having a  party  so I'm  like this  is cool  because there's  a blackout  now they  just flip  all the  lights off  and there's  sex and  drinking  going on  in everyone's  office  Ron and Fez  the hot  girls  man  they are  really  unbelievable  I don't  know what  the hell  is going  on  I know  they treat

[00:32:00]  Anthony  show  and we're  back with  the Opie and  Anthony  show  boy  we gotta get  right to it  in studio  triple H  Anthony  triple H  gentlemen  what's up  how you doing  how you been  good  I'm good  yeah  you  very well  triple H  you guys are  smoking on here  actually  having fun  yeah  effing off  you  I gotta  get right  into it  the  stuff  that's  going on  with  you  and  your  lovely 
[00:32:30]  wife  Stephanie  yeah  hysterical  it's been  good  it's been  a lot  of fun  and the  pictures  that are  making their  way around  the internet  I swear to  god  there are  people  that if  they were  around  they would  have gotten  every shot  of Kennedy's  brains  splattering  all over  the limo  you need  these people  around  when something  important happens  because  if  if  Stephanie  if  Stephanie's  ass crack  pops out  for a second  there's  a thousand  pictures of it  on the net  yeah  it's an  amazing thing  not a thing  goes by now  that doesn't  get a picture 
[00:33:00]  somewhere  that doesn't  make it  on the internet  have you seen  what happened  last night  have you seen  any pictures  of those  it's all  over the internet  which one  from the  MacTown taping  yes  her boob  popped out  have you seen  these pictures  no I've not  seen them  would you like  to see them  let me be the  first to show  you  come over here  let me show  you Stephanie's  boobs  that's where  it popped  out  and it  just goes  down  see that's  full fledged  Stephanie  boobage  coming out 
[00:33:30]  there you go  as you're  gearing up  for the pedigree  there  I guess  that's something  we will not  be seeing  on Smackdown  on Thursday  turn that  around  are they  going to  edit that  out  what do you  mean turn  it around  Opie  have some  class  punch it  up on your  own computer  you guys think  you should have  it enlarged  to full screen  size like that  well that's  we're working  on it right  now we're  having it  enhanced  and blown  up  yeah that's  amazing clarity  yeah  for a shot  that one 
[00:34:00]  and then  the other  day  of course  her ass  was all  over the  internet  because you  decided you  were going to  pull her  into the ring  by the back  of her pants  and for some  reason when did  she stop wearing  panties  she had them on  I had those in my  hand too  oh you did  yeah  because I swear  I could not see  anything that even  resembled a  yeah  no they were  in my hand too  when I picked up  and I didn't  realize she had  quite as much  exposure as she had  oh really  lifting her up  and then I heard  the crowd react 
[00:34:30]  to it  what the hell  did she say to you  when you guys  go in the back  the crack when  she didn't mind  so much  I don't think  I think the  top exposure  the boob out  yesterday  was a little bit  much  did she give you  some hell  for us  have that happen  no it wasn't  my fault  I just assumed  she was taped  in there  went at it  and got a little  more exposure  than we planned  on  right  but  is that what  she does  sometimes  a little  double sided  tape  the girls  will use 
[00:35:00]  a top stick  or double sided  tape  or something  like that  to hold  that stuff  in there  but the funny  thing is how  much reaction  that gets  like a couple  years ago  on TV  I don't remember  who it was  one of us  we were in a  match  and one of us  pinned Rocky  and when I  pulled his leg  up his nuts  and nobody  even noticed  like you know  like never made  the air  like no  it didn't go  on the internet  nobody talked  about it  like I remember  going to the  bag like dude  you're nuts  you know  and nobody  even said  anything about it 
[00:35:30]  the people's  sack  knowing Triple H  like we do  a little bit  I bet you  did that  on purpose  you all heard  the story  about  I told  Conan O'Brien  about Al Snow  right  oh yeah  from top enough  I went to give  him a suplex  and when I  pulled him up  my hand  hooked in his  trunks  and I had him  up in the air  for a good  probably 5 or 10  seconds  and I'm hearing  people like  the whole crowd  is laughing  and I'm like  what the hell  they should be  like thinking  this is impressive  not funny  you know  I'm holding 
[00:36:00]  this guy up  there and the  referee came  around front  and went  oh  and I looked  up and  like right  next to my  head  is just  whole package  was hanging  down  so I just  said  and suplexed  him  and we  just all  started laughing  so I  was hilarious  it looked  like a  grub worm  was trying  to burrow  out of a  fur coat  what kind 
[00:36:30]  of flack  you get  from  what is  Vince  what's  his take  on this  when  you know  Stephanie's  ass crack  shows  her boob  pops out  you know  it's his  daughter  I think  Vince's  take  is burn  the footage  I don't  know about  that  because there  was a  taping  where Vince  was staring  at Stephanie's  cleavage  that clip  was great  a little  too long  they were  in the  back  discussing  something  about  I think  it was  when they  were coming  out  and announcing  it was  the wedding  yeah  and he  looked  right 
[00:37:00]  down  her shirt  and said  daddy's  little girl  come on  daddy's  little girl  oh my  god  she's  come so  far  since she  was that  little girl  chained to  the boiler  on her  first appearance  there  when the  undertaker  was trying  to have  his way  with her  she was  innocent  Stephanie  and then  she got  with  corruptible  hunter  that's  what happened  I ruined her  it makes  for a great  storyline  it's really  funny  I'm sure  she's listening  right now  just mortified  that we're 
[00:37:30]  talking about  breasts  for ten minutes  no we do  that when  she calls  us  she knows  the show  all too  well  she told me  today  she said  first thing  you're going  to do  is talk  about my  boobs  yeah  you're  right  Stephanie  well  when you  pretty much  put an  exclamation point  on both  of them  they look  great  and you  could clearly  see the  exclamation  points  too  indeed  yes  did she discuss  any of the  surgery with you 
[00:38:00]  before she had it  just that she  was going to do  it  yeah  and that was  it  and where did  you go  like oh  okay  you know  I'm all for  that  yeah  you've got  nothing  and you want  something  go for it  yeah  well it's  working out  for her  the more  the merrier  sure  why not  right  we got to  ask you  about the  NWO  there  what about  with the  Hulkster  brother  hey  I  tell you  something  dude  we understand  the NWO  getting a lot  of heat 
[00:38:30]  and stuff  and it's  working  for the  WWF  but  N and I  we just  don't feel  the Hulk  well  I mean  you know  it's working  right now  yeah  it's the  leg drop  thing  it's the  Babe Ruth  you know  what I mean  he's Babe  Ruth to come  back and play  one more season  of Major League  Baseball  we just hope  he doesn't get  hit by a pitch  in the first  inning  break up  into dust  particles  and blow  away  what did  you think  when you  first hear  it's like  okay  here's the  deal  we're bringing  NWO  Hulk Hogan  back to the  WWF 
[00:39:00]  what did  you think  you know  on one hand  it's great  because he's  a legend  in the business  so it is  it's like  saying  Babe Ruth  was alive  Babe Ruth  is going to  come play  on your team  next year  yeah  but it's  the Babe  Ruth  with the  throat  cancer  yeah  but you know  he's going  to play  for a season  and you go  great  that's cool  and then  you know  a few minutes  after he's there  you realize  oh it's  90 year old  Babe Ruth  not the  Babe Ruth  I remembered  you know  and I don't  think that's  necessarily  happened  quite yet  with Hogan  but I mean  you know  I think 
[00:39:30]  he's realistic  about it  too  there's only  so much  more  maybe  that you  can get  out of a  guy  you know  he's in  the twilight  of his career  and he's  doing the  Babe Ruth  run  and that's  great  he's a  great guy  and he  loves this  business  and he  works real  hard at it  so it's  you know  it's hard  for me  to Lamb  Basin  too hard  but I mean  well some  of the signs  that are  popping up  are pretty  funny  about the Hulk  there was  one in the  crowd last  night  and it  said  Hogan  316  and then  it had  a little  flip up  thing  that said  years old  it was  classic  were there 
[00:40:00]  any people  he was hot  too  I saw him  in the  back  he was  like  I'm  not a  day  over  310  were there  any  old  grudges  from anybody  that was  still with  WWF  and him  I know  most of  the guys  from his  heyday  can't  remember  that time  wow  did I  just say  that  I should  have been  taking my  ginkgo  biloba  who are  you  let me  tell you  something  brother  that's a  good  question  though  because  when  these 
[00:40:30]  WCW  guys  come  out  I'm  wondering  what  kind  of  bad  blood  you  guys  got  with  you  know  it's  a weird  thing  because  there  was  some  nasty  bad  mouthing  going  back  and forth  and  when  you're  looking  at it  going  he's  a pretty  big name  and if  I was  on the  other  side  of the  ring  and we  could  sell  out  some  major  arenas  all of  a sudden  it's  easy  to put  aside  your  differences  to  you know  the  Ric Flair 
[00:41:00]  stuff  is  just  great  yeah  that's  good  great  Flair's  classic  you know  I mean  and again  he's  another one  who's  no kid  yeah  you know  he's not  a kid  but at  the same  time  he's not  going out  there and  wrestling  every night  he had the  match with  Vince  which was  great  I think  much better  than people  expected  all the  blood factor  in that  match  is fantastic  yeah  and I  think that  you know  as long as  these guys  are seen  in limited  doses  I don't  think  Hogan's  looking to  come back  and be  a guy  that's  wrestling  on the  show  every  Monday  and  every  Thursday  or whatever 
[00:41:30]  and having  matches  with everybody  on the  card  he's  looking to  come in  and make  big events  now and  then pay  reviews  and things  I think  same as  flares  and be  characters  be the  Babe Ruth  but come  out  every now  and then  in the  ninth inning  and crack  a homer  you know  what's  Goldberg's  problem  there's like  a list  isn't there  I guess  yeah but  what is  his problem  so much  heat with  the WCW  you would  think he  would enjoy 
[00:42:00]  the spotlight  I hear it's  about money  and that he  has a really  good contract  from what I  hear  I don't  think that  Bill was  ever a huge  fan of the  business  and I don't  think that  for me  I was a  fan growing  up  and that's  what I  wanted to  do  and if  I won  100 million  in lottery  tomorrow  I'd still  do this  I'd probably  be a lot  harder to get  along with  but I'd still  do it  but I don't  think he  would  I think  for him  he's got  some money  right now  still being  paid off 
[00:42:30]  from his  old contract  he's going  to sit  back and  make that  if he  comes back  to wrestle  him it'll be  because he  wants some  more money  and that's  probably the  only reason  I don't  think he  has any  passion for  the business  and I  don't think  it really  matters to  him  right  yeah the  guy was  there he  was making  a lot of  money made  a big name  for himself  but didn't  he want to  be into  football or  something like  well he  wasn't football  yeah it didn't  work out for  him and then  he got to  wrestling and  they moved  him along  super fast  but he was  limited ability  I don't think 
[00:43:00]  it's telling  stories about him  to say that  he just had  two three minute  matches with  guys on TV  and just  squashed him  that's not  really what we  do and  anytime he had  to have a  longer match  with somebody  it was  questionable  so how much  money he could  make in the  long term  if he actually  had to be paid  by putting  people in  seats  I don't know  if he would  make any  money  that would  need to be  seen  I don't think  we'll be seeing  him anytime  I don't think  so but again  he's still a  big name so  if the opportunity  came that he  wanted to come  in I'm sure  there would 
[00:43:30]  probably be  some interest  there if he  played his  cards right  and wasn't  looking for the  moon that they  would be willing  to take a chance  just hire  Vin Diesel  and say  it's him  could do  that  kind of  looks like  him  let's go to  the phones  and talk to  Triple H  here  Adam what's  going on  hey what's  up guys  we got  Triple H  man  Triple H  you're a  god  one quick  question  worship me  man  one quick  question  you and  Shawn Michaels  are boys  how many  chicks did  you guys  ball back 
[00:44:00]  in the day  because I  can only  imagine  like you  mean together  or  either or  tag team  like I  would imagine  there had to  be like a  billion  I had a  pretty good  run  you know  back in the  day  I got in  the business  I was a  young man  and you  know  living the  life  you know  on the  road  and  you're  pretty  famous  from TV  and all  that stuff  you know  it doesn't  suck  speaking of  which are  you talking  to China 
[00:44:30]  these days  no  she went  wow  she went  not  Joanie  China  whatever  she was  bad mouthing  you pretty  good there  yeah  you know  I've got  nothing bad  to say  about her  and you  know  of course  probably  because  she hates  me  that's why  she has  the other  bad things  to say  but you  know  it's  I don't  know  it's in my  past now  and you  know  I've moved  on from there  and hopefully  she has  and I wish  her the best  I hope her  movie career  works out  and I hope  she makes  millions of  dollars  and she  gets everything  she wants  out of it  I've got nothing  bad to say 
[00:45:00]  about it  and you know  I think she was  just bitter  and understandably  so and she  went and did  her thing  and that's cool  how's the  real life  relationship  going  with you  no gory  details  I just  mean  you know  you're there  you're working  together all the  time  that's good  you know  I mean  the one thing  we have  a similar  passion for  the business  so that's  kind of good  when you  enjoy doing  the same  things  I think it's  kind of hard  when you  if you have  a career  that you're  a significant  other  doesn't understand  or doesn't  have any  interest in  that's pretty  rough  especially  when you  do it  you know  we're on 
[00:45:30]  the road  so much  and it's  all consuming  you know  I'm sure  it is  for you  guys  too  and if  they don't  understand  it's doomed  yeah I guess  so it's pretty  cool and it's  working out great  and she's a great  girl so  yeah  we think the  world of her  too man  she's such a  blast  she really is  cool  even more so  today  now that we  get to see  her body parts  that's an extra  bonus  I'm sure she  just freaking  loves that  I'm sure  she loves  that  she's mortified  you know 
[00:46:00]  because it's  strange  she is  in person  she's kind  of shy  you know  she's a little  reserved and  stuff and  when you see  her in the  ring just  talking smack  and acting  it's hysterical  when you've  met her and  spoken to her  and realized  what she's  really like  it's like  oh my god  that's not  her  her can is  hanging out  her ass  is hanging out  she's probably  mortified  yeah she's  the exact  opposite of  her character  and her mom  can't be too  happy about it  I don't think  either one of  them necessarily 
[00:46:30]  are too  happy about  it  but you know  it's an amazing  thing though  that like  and I don't  know if she  would ever do  this  but you know  it's like  amazing thing  that if  somebody were  to go like  you know  I'm going  to do  playboy  and I'm  going to  be nude  in front  of the  world  it's like  no big  deal  but if  your can  comes out  on accident  you're like  oh my god  you know  it's like  you're just  mortified  it's not  on your  terms  yeah  and somehow  it's almost  like you  snuck the  peak  and it's  it's a little  more exciting  and dirty 
[00:47:00]  to see it  like that  oh look  it wasn't  supposed to  happen  but it  didn't  I saw  it  it's definitely  hotter  hey why don't  we take a  break  we've got  Triple H  in the studio  we'll talk  about Wrestlemania  next  yeah  also I think  we've got  some girls  that came  by to get  spanked  are you allowed  to do that  still  you know  hey I'm  in character  right  that's exactly  what we  registered  yes  you'll be in  character  I'm in  character  now and I  can do  what my  character would  do  which is  bring in  the broads  alright  and we'll  take more  of your 
[00:47:30]  phone calls  as well  you have  30 seconds  to well  need  whip on  out  whip on  out  whip on  out  I've got  boobs to  show you  wow  the Opie  and Anthony  show  and we're  back with  the Opie  and Anthony  show  our guests  are backing  up here  Lewis Black  in the studio  from the  daily show  on Comedy  Central  Lewis  do you  know who  that is 
[00:48:00]  no clue  right  that's a  big guy  why would  I know  I'm  do you  watch  wrestling  are you  here to  get spanked  by Triple  H  no  you know  you ever  hear  of  Wrestlemania  yes  of course  all right  you just  discovered  video games  last week  so  slow down  some of  us are  out there  going to  the  heartland  entertaining  every  individual  this is  what he  does  I know  he  does  I'll  ask  Triple H  do you  know  Lewis  Black  sure  you've  seen him  on the  daily show  John  Stewart  very funny 
[00:48:30]  show  yes  very funny  man  see  nice  Lewis  nice way  to  reciprocate  you couldn't  fake it  you couldn't  fake it  at all  if I said I  watched wrestling  then you'd ask me a question  I'd look like a jacket  we wouldn't do that to you  we wouldn't do that to you  we wouldn't do that before we ask you a question  we don't have to ask you a question for you to look like a jacket  they're going to do that to you anyway  hey you're all dressed up  what are you doing  going to the daily show  oh  that's right  it's Wednesday  what are you doing tonight on the daily show  tonight is  they're digitized 
[00:49:00]  they're digitizing  they're digitizing films now  you know they take  they put a bra on  on the  on the Bond film  on the James Bond film  and then in  they need some of that technology  for  E.T.  they took the guns out of the FBI hands  and put walkie talkies in  and they  put walkie talkies in  and they digitized the wrinkles off of  Mick Jagger  which didn't help  because  that must have taken a while  it took a week and a half  why'd they take the guns out of the hands  on the  because it's a nice movie E.T. 
[00:49:30]  and it's the 20th anniversary  we can do when you see these guns  you know why  why  because  Drew Barrymore  talked to Stephen  and she said  she doesn't like the gun thing  she doesn't like the gun thing  she doesn't like us  without guns  is she like marrying a guy with ball cancer  I really can't stomach her  she stinks  you are horrible  Lewis can we finish our little interview  are we disturbing you  you want to sit over there  ok  I'll sit over here  I want to sit  so that I'm out of your eyesight 
[00:50:00]  you're interviewing people now  for your special  that's going to be on Comedy Central  I was reading that in the paper today  you went down to Washington  you're interviewing senators and stuff  why don't you ask Triple H a question  it doesn't have to be about wrestling  what would you like to ask Triple H  the biggest name in wrestling today  do you do your own taxes?  if you do  could you do mine?  you're Jewish right?  yeah  no kidding 
[00:50:30]  I don't think he worries about that  there  you know  you know  somebody does that right  yeah  I got a good firm  good  yeah  Lewis we brought girls in  for Triple H to spank  this I gotta say  we've never done that for you  have we?  no you haven't  that's why I snuck in today  hey there have been a couple of instances  where he has  had some very attractive girls  all over him  left with them  I believe  to go to dinner or something  no it sounded good  yeah 
[00:51:00]  they wanted to be  three in the morning  yeah  you know  which is a really great time  and you said no  I didn't say no  these strippers  they were strippers  weren't they?  yes  and they wanted to  go with Lewis  three in the morning  and leave  what do strippers do  at three in the morning?  they F  they have sex  and you turned it down  you guys are just incredible  why would you say no to that?  look you guys  you don't drive a milk truck  you're a comic  why wouldn't you meet them  at three in the morning?  I wouldn't meet them  at three in the morning  because I was going to 
[00:51:30]  some book  what was it called?  what was it?  it was run by  the whole thing was scammy  from the beginning  okay  what do you think  you're going to wake up  in a bathtub full of ice  with your kidney missing  exactly  get to the hospital  the whole thing was a little odd  yeah  you know  it was in a room  that I  like a nightclub  I've never heard of  sponsored by a group  of people  who have a website  that I can't find  and you know  and they all seem to be  you know  they were all interested  and they would all  would have really crushed  my schwarz  you know what I mean?  so  well yeah  isn't that the idea? 
[00:52:00]  start slow  isn't that the idea?  I think so  I think Lewis would like  to start a little slower  yeah  one girl at 11 o'clock  at night  one girl from tiny  one girl from tiny town  yeah  then work your way up  until three strippers  at three in the morning  clearly  that was too much  and I'd had three shows  that night  alright  it's not about you though  we're talking to Triple H  okay  I'm sure  I'm backing off  I don't know  it just sounds like  a lame excuse to me  yeah  just a tad  I know  you gotta  you come in here  and don't agree  with these two schmucks  have you been in here before 
[00:52:30]  because if you start  to be nice to them  then the next time  you're in  they go  here he is  here he comes  Lewis the difference  look at you  and look at him  would we ever do that to him?  we are never  we are never gonna say  anything bad  about Triple H  you know  I came in here  with the hopes  I was gonna have  a room full of naked women  I got an old  Jewish comedian  in here  oh god  how old are you?  I'm that old  he got arrested  for our show 
[00:53:00]  too once  yeah  really  him and Jim Norton  got arrested  on the voyeur bus  that see-through bus  full of naked broads  we drove down  one of the mayors  well we had  to stock with teens  was the problem  teen naked girls  driving down broadway  did you get any that day?  no because they took us in  in jail  he spent 28 hours  in jail  for our show  28 hours in jail  we're lucky  I'm glad we didn't get  anything that day  forcible entry  alright  it was like  a bad scene  out of Oz  we could have used you 
[00:53:30]  that day  I can tell you that  because Norton  is sitting there  asking the guy  the guy down  the head of the  police department  down in Norton  is saying  you know how can  Lewis and I  protect each other  and the cop  looked at him  and said  what are you  delusional?  there's not  not even a chance  he needed you  alright let's go  back to the phone  he'd have been  taking advantage  of you  Jimmy what's going on  hey guys what's up  alright we're  talking to Triple H  when Lewis isn't  interrupting  hey game 
[00:54:00]  yeah  hey what's up  with your dog  on Monday  what's up with my dog  what do you mean  yeah got ran over  by that limo  yeah I know it  he got a broken leg  you're sorry  I pulled him out  of the axle  he was just fine  she was just fine  yeah  Norton rules  thank you sir  that's all you  want to ask  hey guys  yeah  I'm a bastard  goddess  hey Rick  listeners play  little games like that  why don't we  get him back  turn the radio off  yeah okay click  why don't we  bring the chick in  or the lovely lady  yes  thanks sweetie 
[00:54:30]  it wouldn't be  a Triple H  appearance  without some girl  getting spanked  by Triple H  yes  what else do we  need to talk about  about Wrestlemania  I mean it sounds  like it's going to be  a great one  it's the biggest  pay-per-view of all  time  yeah it's  Wrestlemania  Toronto  it's this Sunday  and you know  what is that tool  Mule Juice  McQuaid doing  what is he doing  this time  that Mule Juice  McQuaid  Moon Juice  Jericho  Moon Jizz  McQueen  whatever the hell  he was calling  himself  Chris Jericho  I'm going to  knock him back  into that personality 
[00:55:00]  he's going to  need a record  career when I'm  done with him  this Sunday  he came in here  we love the guy  he wouldn't get  out of that  character  he would not  leave  it was during  when he was  touring with  his band  what was his  band called  Moose Juice  or something  no that was him  Fozzy  so he's touring  around and he's  not getting out  of god damn  character  and we're like  dude  come on  Chris  Chris  hello  Chris  no I'm  Mule Man Juice  McQuaid  Moon Goose McQueen  hey when you've  got a lucrative  career touring 
[00:55:30]  small 200 seat  nightclubs  around the country  you're serious  about what you do  and won't break  character  I guess that's it  I don't know  this seemed a little  odd we wanted to  talk to Chris  Jericho and he  wasn't there  wow this guy  listen to this guy  Ryan what's up  hello  you're on with  Triple H  go ahead  I just want to  know what it  was like to  carry Chris  Jericho through  like one Iron  man match you  guys had  well alright  you're a little  confused I never  had an Iron  Man match  I'm sorry  two out of  three falls 
[00:56:00]  no I didn't  have that with  him either  but I did  have a last  man standing  match  I was so  close  you were  close  it's early  you know  but uh  yeah  you know  it was a hell  of a match  we had a  hell of a war  and uh  I look forward  to doing it  again with him  this Sunday  I'm gonna  you know  beat his ass  and take the  title  you know  we stopped  him from  wearing that  stupid thing  on top of  his head  remember  when he was  wearing that  the pebbles  thing  on the top 
[00:56:30]  of his head  he came in  one time  when we said  that hair  thing  every time  you hit the  ring  it looks like  a splurt  coming out  of a big  man junk  it looks like  a splurt  of spunk  we called it  a spunk  fountain  a jizz  fountain  there was a  point in time  where he thought  like that hairdo  was cool  and the big  furry mutton chop  on the side  were cool  and stuff  and he thought  that was the  gig  but I think  he didn't realize  people were just  laughing  he'd walk out  with that hair  and everyone  just start laughing 
[00:57:00]  look at this  Nimrod  he's got the  fountain on his  head  hey Mike  what's going on  what's up  Owen A  what's up  game  how you guys  doing  all right  what's going on  Louis you also  ruled too  over there  you are the  best  game I'm  looking forward  to hopefully  seeing you  at the CAA  come a couple  weeks down the  line  question  what happened  with the  knee  man  how's the  knee  after Jericho  clipped her  with the  sledge  so far  it's so good  you know  what I mean  it's  you know  ten months  ago I tore  it so it was  a pretty serious  injury and I  came back from 
[00:57:30]  something they  said I couldn't  come back from  and you know  Jericho tried  to take advantage  of it  it looked a little  too eerie for me  I thought  it's a little  bit sore  a little bit  worse than it  was but I'll  be fine  I'll be at  Wrestlemania  no worries  there you go  that injury  sounded horrific  yeah let's  tell Lewis  you know what  happened to this  guy for real  his quad muscle  from the knee  up or  yeah but right  right above my  knee where your  quad attaches 
[00:58:00]  was like one of  the biggest muscles  in your body  and it just  tore right from  the insertion  tore and just  rolled up my thigh  and the whole muscle  rolled all the way  up his thigh  and I wrestled  another four minutes  or so  six minutes  something like  that with it  up there  and then went  through about  ten months  of rehab  to come back  and it was  tough  that's worse  than like  when one  of your  yams  from your  yam bag  slips up  for a second  and you go  oh hey  hey  for a second  you think  you've only  got one  and then you  go no  no  it's like  hey get  down there  get back  down there  that little  tap

[01:14:30]  keep you from coming back  again to this show  in the future  please remember  the good time  you had last time  I'll come back  banking on the fact  that you guys  will make it up to me  next time I'm here  tenfold  yes  tenfold  we'll make it up  I've not lost  my confidence  in you two  we got something  to look forward to  yes  just imagine  what we'll have  next time  forget about it  you want to spank  Ratzo Rizzo  before you leave  oh god damn  knock her  scoliosis straight  oh wow 
[01:15:00]  awful  Big V  what's going on  what's up guys  how we doing  hey  big fan of Triple H  big fan of what you do  in that ring  I got a question for you  yeah  now that some of the  Alzheimer's are coming back  like Hulk Hogan  I imagine  while you were growing up  you probably watched him  how does it feel  to work with those guys  that's pretty cool  you know I mean  to watch you guys  you grew up with  he's a little bit  different now  than when I grew up  watching him  but you know 
[01:15:30]  it's pretty cool  I mean it's like  you know I'm sure  if you played basketball  and you get to come back  and play with Larry Bird  or something like that  it'd be a huge thrill  and you know  it's good to have him around  and like I say  he's the Babe Ruth  of wrestling  and you know  hopefully he can  play a few innings  and hit a few home runs  and be good for the business  when you say that  if not I'll hit him  and he'll shatter  like a pile of dust  and we'll go on  I was just going to ask you that  I know you're not a modest guy  how would you  put yourself  and your ring experience  up against anybody  who's been in the wrestling business 
[01:16:00]  where do you rank yourself  I'll go up against anybody  from any time  you know what I mean  there's been some greats  in the business  but I'd like to consider myself  one of them  so you know  everybody's got different styles  got their own gig  but you know  I'll put my stuff up  against any of theirs  and I'm looking forward  to getting in the ring  with Hogan  and I'm looking forward  to getting in the ring  with Flair  and all those guys  bring it on  for me  and I'll tell you what  one day  I hope to get in the ring  with you my man  alright man  alright be good  thanks Big V  alright later guys  alright 
[01:16:30]  I just hope I'm not 50  when he does it  he must give you crap  about the Babe Ruth thing  could you at least say  DiMaggio  does it have to go back  to the old black and white  fast motion films  well I guess we gotta  get him out of here  yeah Hunter  he's doing Conan O'Brien  tonight  Candy one more shot  from Triple H  yeah  Candy  at first she was like  that hurts  now she's like  yeah a little more  alright let's put a mic  on Candy  yeah  on the mouth part  Toronto is backing up 
[01:17:00]  now come in here Mark  you gotta warm it up  you gotta warm it up  warm it up  warm it up Mark  Rick put the mic on her  cause he'll move the mic  around the other way  Candy's a trooper man  ready  alright there we go  he just hit his  that wasn't even Hunter  can you give it like  a good moan  not like he just  crippled your moan  wait that wasn't even  Triple H  no  alright  listen to this smack  you gotta give some type  of uh  consolation prize  for me being here 
[01:17:30]  give them some type  of like orgasmic moan  before I do it  before you do it  yeah  like right now  yeah  oh god 
[01:18:00]  are you okay  oh my god  The best part was her face hitting the microphone.  She lurched forward about two feet.  Did you see that ass come apart?  Do it for me.  See, this show's not so bad.  Wow.  What do you think, Candy?  That was good.  She's thanking him, so it couldn't be that bad.  Bravo.  All right. 
[01:18:30]  Triple H, thanks for hanging with us.  And next time, you're going to say that you're going to need an IV drip of some sort of antibiotic when you leave next time.  That's how many sick girls we're going to bring in for you.  All right, let's do it.  I just want to mention one more thing before I go.  Continental Airlines Arena on the 28th of March.  It's a Thursday night.  NWO's going to be there.  Hulk Hogan in his first appearance since, like what?  The 1800s.  Since 1993 is going to be there. 
[01:19:00]  And I'm going to be in Continental Airlines Arena.  I'm a little bit flustered now.  Yeah.  For the first time in over a year.  And it's not a SmackDown, but it's a huge event.  And it's on a Thursday night.  And we're going to rock that place.  So that's the place to be.  Cool.  On WrestleMania Sunday, watch me become WWF World Champion and kick Chris Jericho's ass.  That is going to be fun to watch.  Pay-per-view Sunday.  Cool.  What, Patty?  Uh, Patty's a little embarrassed to ask him to smack her just once. 
[01:19:30]  What?  She's going to break in half.  He's not going to hold back.  Patty, are you insane?  You're asking that question.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  This is a girl.  He's never coming back.  I know.  How are we going to give him that?  The last image he's going to have is of Stalker Patty's butt.  It's not pretty, my friend.  So, anyways, got to go.  Yeah, exactly.  Hunter's got to leave.  Unfortunately, I've got to go. 
[01:20:00]  But I thought you were in character.  Yeah.  Wait, hold on.  I'm getting out of character.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Got to go.  Damn it, he's out of character.  But, see, if he spanks Stalker Patty, then when he has to talk to Stephanie about his appearance  on the show, this could make it a little better.  Look, do you want to abuse our guests like this?  Look at the girl.  First of all, she can't take a hit.  She's got a bum leg.  She's got a Treblinka hairdo.  That's not my fault.  She's not looking. 
[01:20:30]  That's not my fault.  Well, she has hair like Ewan McGregor.  That's not my fault.  All right, we're not going to put Triple H through there.  No, of course not.  I've got to tag out the Louis on this one.  Tag out.  No, no.  No, not even if you come at me.  I'd rather take a punch.  There's a few things Louis will fight about, and this is one of them.  Yeah, exactly.  Patty, you're going to have to be satisfied with a picture or something, because it ain't 
[01:21:00]  happening.  Louis is making a shiv out of some plastic over there that he learned while he was in  prison if he has to stab me if I try to force him to do this.  God, you're funny, man.  All right, Triple H.  We're all going to watch WrestleMania on pay-per-view this Sunday.  Have fun at Conan, and come see us soon, all right?  Thanks, guys.  See you next time.  Triple H.  What country are you from?  Uh, what?  What ain't no country I ever heard of.  They speak English and what?  Uh, what?  English, mother...  Do you speak it?  Yeah.  Then you know what I'm saying.  Uh, what? 
[01:21:30]  Say what again.  Say what again.  I dare you.  I tell you, you mother...  Say what one more...  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Do it again.  Okay.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Destroy, destroy.  Ah!  What much?  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Want to thank Triple H for stopping by.  That was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  We're going to have to make it up to them next time around.  I know. 
[01:22:00]  The first time, it was really cold.  The chicks are there.  Clothes completely off.  Getting swatted on their ass.  The ladies in New York letting us down once again, except for Candy.  Well, Candy was cold, but even that, you know...  Go ahead.  She had the fishnets on.  But that's okay.  That's good.  It was pretty much bare ass.  You know what?  We're going to have to ship them in from Philly and Cleveland.  Two cities that understand the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's the IP?  The strippers?  Very important.  Crude?  I don't know.  They're a strip club. 
[01:22:30]  They advertise on this program.  And I am holding judgment.  I am not going to...  The girls were beautiful, but we're not going to give it that extra oomph in the live read  when we had two of them in here and they don't want to take their jeans off.  I know.  Yeah, well, Candy left with Stalker Patty's cane.  Oh, really?  Congrats.  I couldn't walk.  I couldn't walk.  She was wearing like just a Band-Aid.  Did you see that?  Did you see her rack?  That one dancer?  Oh, my God.  I don't care if she wouldn't get married.  Those are the nicest dresses I've ever seen.  Yeah, but I swear to God, I want like a scene with like Joey Pants and the Sopranos when 
[01:23:00]  he took that stripper out back by the guardrail.  That's what I want to happen now.  I'm disappointed.  For Vice Squad, Wings Houser as Ramrod.  Wings Houser.  Remember him beating Nina Blackwood to death?  I'm going to love you, Ginger.  Open the door.  Yeah.  And she opens it and he beats her near to death.  I am going to have to rent that.  Fred Berry was in that rerun.  That's the one he got stabbed.  Fred rerun Berry. 
[01:23:30]  He pleaded sugar pimp.  Sugar pimp.  Sugar pimp named Dorsey.  Constance, what's up?  You're amazing, Norton.  Constance.  Yeah.  What do you got?  I am so glad you threw those F and C's out of there.  Yes.  There are people in Ohio like me who would crawl to New York on their knees to let Hunter  do whatever he wanted.  See?  Really?  Well, you know what?  But you know what?  We had an open invite, so technically the ladies from the other cities could have made  the ride.  Wow.  I just found out about it today and I'm sitting here dying. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  Well, thank you.  We got to move on because we're so busy today.  We got Louis Black from The Daily Show in studio.  Stephen Lynch is outside the studio.  He's coming in to sing a brand new song for us.  And on the phone, one of our newer friends, Dennis Leary.  Dennis Leary.  How you doing, man?  What's going on?  Hello, Mr. Leary.  Dennis.  Hey, Dennis.  Dennis, thank God you didn't come into the studio today because we would have embarrassed  you.  Why?  It would have been embarrassing.  Why?  Well, we started to think, you know, we got some power and stuff and we had these girls 
[01:24:30]  from VIP, a strip club here in New York in.  Yeah.  And, you know, they were supposed to get spanked by Triple H, big, huge superstar in wrestling.  Yeah.  And the girls let us down and we looked like idiots.  What do you mean?  Strippers that didn't want to take their pants off.  What the hell is that about?  Exactly.  That's exactly what we said.  What was their excuse?  One of them said she had a sunburn on her ass and the other one said her ass hurt and  she didn't want a big handprint on it at the strip club tonight because she wouldn't 
[01:25:00]  make as much money.  And I'm like, if you tell, if people know and hear on the show that they could go down  to VIP, see this girl and see Hunter, Hunter's handprint on her ass.  Yeah, it's money in the bank.  Right.  And the one was trying to be funny.  Let me tell you, there's nothing worse than a stripper trying to show personality.  I don't care if you throw Jews in a box card.  By the way, can I just say this, by the way?  Yes.  The line of funny strippers is a very short one.  Okay?  If you're at the supermarket and it says express line, you know, 10 items or less and funny 
[01:25:30]  stripper line, go to the funny stripper line.  There's not going to be anybody there.  All right?  Exactly.  I don't even like feigning interest at the inane conversations they start.  Like in between songs, when they have to dip down and cover up their breasts with their  shirt because for some reason they can't show them when the song's not playing.  That's right.  All of a sudden they turn into the prudent and they're talking about school or their  home life or how their landlord's going to throw them out unless she sucks it or something.  See?  I don't want to hear it.  That's where you and I differ.  Why?  I'm a master at those conversations. 
[01:26:00]  Are you?  Oh, yeah.  What do you do?  I smoke cigarettes and have a whiskey and I go, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  I can do it for hours on end.  I got to try that because I just get this look like, just take your goddamn clothes off.  Because that's what I'm there for.  That's why I'm paying 12 bucks for a bottle of Bud.  Yeah.  I mean, you think we're coming in here because the booze is cheap or good?  Yeah.  Or cold?  Nice and watered down.  Right.  Unbelievable.  Please.  Please.  Thank God Dennis Leary wasn't here today.  I mean, Lewis, he's seen us at our worst, so who cares? 
[01:26:30]  And we did have him arrested.  We're still trying to impress Dennis Leary.  Last time he was here, we gave him a good show.  Today, he would have been like, ugh.  Hey, is that Lewis Black there?  Yeah.  Hey, Dennis.  Hey, Lou.  How you doing?  I'm bad there.  And you make me laugh my balls out.  Thank you.  Yeah, very funny, Lewis.  You're going to say you're very funny.  I thought I was just talking to you guys on the phone.  Unbelievable.  Hey, Dennis, I saw you on The Daily Show the other day.  Yeah, last night.  Yeah, talking about St. Paddy's Day. 
[01:27:00]  You honestly, I wasn't buying for a second you don't drink on St. Paddy's Day.  No, I drink.  I just do it in the privacy of my own domicile.  Is that what you do?  Yeah.  But the thing is, now, I can see it's probably hard for you to go out to just a local place  and start drinking, but in the old days, what?  What would you do?  In the old days?  Yeah.  Oh, the old days.  Forget it.  Go down there to the Southie and pair it up.  You don't want to know what the old days were like.  The old days, St. Patrick's Day was not a day.  It was a week, okay?  Yeah. 
[01:27:30]  It started, you know, six days before, and St. Patrick's Day was the finale.  Right.  And there was no eating.  There was just drinking.  And there were some, you know, chemicals involved as well.  Ah.  And there's a lot of talking and screaming and fighting and crying and talking and screaming  and fighting, all with the same guys, you know?  Fighting your cousins, we used to like to call it.  Yeah, I've seen that happen.  But it's just hard nowadays.  I mean, you show up at a bar and people are already drunk and they're all over you and  just, you know.  Yeah.  A couple years ago, I had a guy puke dangerously close to my shoes. 
[01:28:00]  And I was like, you know what?  It might be time to retire from St. Patrick's Day.  Yeah.  And the subways are brutal on that day.  Oh, man.  My favorite is when you get the Puerto Rican guys with the faces painted green, you know?  Happy St. Patrick's Day, man.  Yeah.  Okay.  Sure.  Peace me, I'm either.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So you just stay home now, yeah.  We did the St. Patty's Day in Southie.  You haven't lived until you've done St. Patty's.  Oh, my God.  A day in Southie.  How was it?  In Boston.  It was interesting. 
[01:28:30]  One thing I found a little odd, the kids were running around with these things called  bomb packs.  Yes.  And they throw them under cars and stuff.  And I thought this is a little too reminiscent of Ireland and things that are going on.  That's their tribute to the old time.  I guess so.  You know?  There's explosives going on on St. Patty's Day.  They've got to blow some stuff up.  And then the puke hopscotch on the way home trying to circumnavigate the streets.  Oh, yeah.  And just stepping over vomit. 
[01:29:00]  And the fights.  And plenty of fights.  Well, Boston, you know, it's one of the things I love about Massachusetts.  Boston and Worcester are two of the fight in this town.  I think John Stewart was the guy who said that once on stage while we were doing a show  in Boston.  Yeah.  He said, he said, what are you guys fighting about?  It seems like one long fight.  I took a friend of mine, Jim Serpico, who works with me, Italian guy here from New York.  I took him up to see a Bruins game, right?  And we're sitting, it's all Bruins fans.  We're sitting in good seats on the aisle. 
[01:29:30]  And down below us is a group of Irish guys in one aisle and a group of Italian guys in  the other aisle.  And you could hear they were kind of shouting stuff at each other already.  I said, I guarantee you, before the second period is over, those two groups of guys will  be in a big brawl.  He goes, what are you talking about?  They all have Bruins stuff.  I said, it's not about the Bruins.  It's about the Italian and the Irish.  Halfway through the second period, gigantic brawl.  Huge brawl.  You got to love Boston just for that, man.  Yeah.  There used to be a fight at the drop of a hat.  They don't even have to have a hat drop. 
[01:30:00]  They just go out.  They look at each other.  A friend of mine was directing a movie and he said, I need to do some research into bars  up in Boston because I've got to shoot in one.  And I said, well, whatever you do, don't walk into a bar in Southie without having  some local guy with you.  Yep.  And he was like, yeah, yeah.  So sure enough, like three days later, I get a phone call.  He got the crap beat out of him because him and his DP, you know, his DP had like a diamond  earring and, you know.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, you know, fingernail polish, you know, one of those guys.  They walked into a bar. 
[01:30:30]  They walked in.  And it was like two o'clock in the afternoon.  There's like three local guys in there.  One guy turned around and he said, get out before we kill you.  Wow.  So that's just, you know.  That's the, yeah, that's the head up there, man.  It's really, really something to see.  Hey, this guy, Eric, is dying to talk to you, Dennis.  Eric, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  That job last week was absolute classic with you meeting the parents.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I'll tell you what.  I'm going to tell you what. 
[01:31:00]  If you thought, and the whole cast feels this way, if you thought that one was good or  the NyQuil one, the Viagra episode, I'm telling you that tonight's episode, the wedding  anniversary for Pip, is probably the craziest, most insane show that we did.  Yeah.  Because we go to his wife's anniversary party for him.  It's at his house.  And she doesn't allow booze in the house.  And she doesn't allow smoking.  And all hell breaks loose.  And it's just insane.  Absolutely insane.  Yeah.  The show is great. 
[01:31:30]  It is.  It's a good show.  What is ABC doing?  What are they doing?  Idiots.  Well, you know, I was wondering what was going on.  When I went over there, there was a couple of monkeys.  Wait, what happened?  Well, they just keep screwing around with his schedule.  Yeah.  Well, we're on two more weeks.  Then we go off for four weeks.  Then we come back from May Sweep.  What the hell is that about?  It's crazy.  I don't know.  And then one week...  Because you know these people out there.  If there's no continuity, they lose the thread.  I know.  Well, why did they have you replace Koppel?  To hell with it.  What are they...  I'd rather watch the job every night. 
[01:32:00]  What are they putting on in its place?  They're actually putting on...  Contractually, they have to put on Peter Toland's...  Well, Peter Toland's my partner in the job.  He writes the show with me.  He's got another show he's executive producing that if they don't run the show now, they lose  the actors in June.  So they have to kind of put it on.  Goddamn politics.  So, you know, what are you going to do?  All I got to say is if you're out there and you like the job, watch Tonight, which is  hilarious, next week.  And then just keep it in mind.  Email ABC.  Tell them how much you love the show.  And bombard them. 
[01:32:30]  And then get ready for it when we come back in May.  You know?  Yep.  Absolutely.  That's all we can do right now.  I mean, we're up against the West Wing, too, which is just killing me.  Oh, I don't even understand who watches that show.  I think it's the same audience that would watch our show if our show was on at a different  time.  You know?  That's what I think.  I don't get who watches it.  Like, with everything that's going on in this country and the world these days, why would  you have to watch a show about a fake president and a fake White House?  Well, I got to tell you...  How about the real thing? 
[01:33:00]  It's pretty exciting.  I know.  I thought the real thing is pretty...  I haven't been able to watch the West Wing since all this stuff went down on 9-11.  Yeah.  Oh, gee, what's the fake president going to handle on the fake show today?  I think it would be a much better show if it was the actual Sheen family.  Right.  Put cameras in their house and Charlie's house and Emilio's house and let's see what  happens.  Like they're doing with Ozzy.  Yeah, screw the Osboards.  Like what they're doing with Ozzy.  That's classic.  And now, also...  I haven't seen Ozzy's show yet, but I'm sure it would be something like that.  Oh, the Ozzy show.  That was a good show.  You got to take a peek. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, I saw the previous one.  It was hilarious.  It needs subtitles, but besides that...  Yeah, you can barely understand Ozzy.  He's just like...  Oh, really?  Well, this dog went on the carpet, man.  What's going on?  How many animals do we need in this place?  I can't even take it.  You're like, what did Ozzy say?  He walks you watch like five times, though, because you got to pick up what Ozzy's saying.  He walks around his mansion in Beverly Hills and he looks like an older, retarded guy.  I mean, we love Ozzy, but it's kind of embarrassing to watch.  Wow.  But that's why we like it, I guess.  It makes him human, though.  You just want to sit on the couch with him and put your arm around him and talk. 
[01:34:00]  He came out of a steam room, I guess, in last night's episode.  The guy with the robe and his hair up.  He looked like an old woman.  He looked like an old tattooed woman.  The kids are psychopaths.  Are they really?  They're crazy children that have been raised pretty much with an absentee father.  Right.  And now they are paying him back in space.  Twofold.  It's amazing.  Yeah, Ozzy probably shouldn't have spent so much time on the road.  Oh, my God.  It's a lot of fun.  They pretty much run the house.  There's so much cursing going on. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, it's so funny to see a legendary rock guy like that being treated like crap by his family.  Hey, this could start a whole trend, though, man.  After Ozzy's show is over, we could do the Keith Richards family, you know?  Yeah.  That would be...  Just to see Keith, you know, stumbling with that thing where he hurt his arm, he broke  his foot because he said he was in his reading room in his library.  Yeah.  And he tripped.  Yeah.  He was trying to get a book off of a shelf and he tripped.  Sure.  You know, I mean, I would just...  Because I don't know, this show on Ozzy, is he drinking all day or does he not drink 
[01:35:00]  anymore?  He drinks like Diet Coke.  And he was coloring something.  And he was coloring something.  Like, he has nothing to do.  You could tell.  Does he take pills?  It's a man with nothing to do.  No, I haven't seen him take any drugs.  Supposedly, he's clean right now.  Yeah, but once he puts liquid in his body, it all comes back.  That's right.  That's what the liquid is.  Anything that gets the cell going.  That's right.  It's like a sponge.  Yeah, exactly.  He was coloring last night.  Coloring what?  Just like he had crayons and a piece of paper and he's coloring.  The guy has nothing to do.  Nothing to do all day. 
[01:35:30]  And it's embarrassing to watch.  You cringe watch.  He's got how many dogs?  Yeah, I don't know.  He's got like eight of them.  I can't even tell.  And they all crap all over the floor and take leaks on the carpet.  And he's just running around with like, why are the dogs crapping on my carpets?  It's like, it's Ozzy.  You know, the legendary rock guy and he's got to worry about dogs crapping.  You know what?  Sometimes I worry about how I'm bringing my kids up.  And then you hear something like this and you're just like, I've got to be on the right track.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I've got to be on the right track. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, I think you, what happened?  You actually got a little bit responsible when you had your kids.  Well, you have to.  When you have kids, especially when they're in your, you know, possession for the weekend or whatever.  Yeah, man.  Like my son had his, his birthday isn't for a few more weeks, but because his classmates are going away on their spring Easter break thing.  We had the party here in the city today.  You know, I had like eight kids.  And, you know, you've got to keep count of them and watch where they're going and all that stuff.  Make them get them into the truck, get them out of the truck, you know, all that stuff. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  You know, you can't wander around on lithium drinking a Diet Coke with a coloring book.  You know what I mean?  It's just not allowed.  I just remember all I really knew of Dennis Leary was the character from, you know, MTV, from those commercials,  then the few movies and your stand-up.  And then when I heard you were becoming a father, it's like, oh, my God, another couple of poor victims being brought into the world.  You know, they couldn't imagine you as a parent.  They actually think I'm the coolest guy right now because of this movie Ice Age I have coming out this weekend. 
[01:37:00]  That's right.  You're in the voice of that one.  Yeah, and they think it's just like, you know, my dad's a tiger.  I'm a saber-toothed tiger in the movie.  Yeah, dude, what kind of money do those things pull in, those animated features like that?  Let me tell you something, cons and cons.  Oh, yeah.  And I took all back end.  You did?  Oh, yeah.  So I've got to tell everybody out there.  But I mean this.  It actually is a really funny movie that you can enjoy with the kids, but you've got to go this weekend because I've got a lot of stuff I want to buy.  Dennis, Dennis, I've got to start my own airline, you know? 
[01:37:30]  A movie like that, you could come out yourself and say it blows, don't see it, and it's going to gross like bazillions.  There's no other kids' movie out for two weeks.  Right, and it looks great.  It's like a, it's digital animation.  It looks fantastic from the trailers I've seen.  Yeah, it is.  It's great, actually.  I mean, they did a good job.  And Legu Zahn was characterist, hysterical.  So, I mean, I had kids, I have ages 5 to 13, sitting in my row with me, and they were, all of them were laughing.  And there was like four or five jokes the kids don't get that were good for the parents. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  You know, it's like an hour and a half.  I mean, you don't have a buck and a half.  You can just go in and sit there and laugh your balls off, you know?  Come on.  It's cool.  And, you know, it comes out on video.  I get all that money, too.  So, come on.  Nice.  Hey, Dennis, we're hurt in Canada, and Nate has already seen the job that's on tonight in the States.  Oh, really?  Let's get a review.  Nate.  How you doing, boys?  What's up, man?  Not too much.  How you doing, Dennis?  Good, man.  Hey, you looking forward to some shrimp or what?  Yeah.  That's a funny scene, isn't it?  Yeah.  Great.  Great flick.  Adam's girlfriend is freaking insane. 
[01:38:30]  She is crazy.  Yeah.  That is.  Tonight's show goes by, and it seems like you sat down for five minutes.  Yeah, it's crazy.  It goes quick.  It's a quick half hour of the show.  But tonight, everybody is so drunk and messed up halfway through the show.  And Adam's girlfriend is like an S&M freak.  And she's just beating the crap out of him, and he's loving it.  That's great.  Yeah, it's a great show, Dennis.  Love it.  You loved it, huh, Nate?  Good.  Yeah, fantastic.  Tonight's show is probably one of the best ones I've seen yet.  It was just killer.  Thanks, man. 
[01:39:00]  All right.  Talk to y'all later.  There you go, from the horse's mouth.  I know.  Yeah.  Nate.  Hey, Dennis, are you doing anything else with Sandra Bullock?  Not besides dinner, no.  Okay.  You know.  What is that about, Norton?  I got an email, and somebody asked me, is he doing another movie with Sandra Bullock,  so I'm asking him.  And you figured you'd...  I asked him.  I asked him.  I asked him, so I asked him.  That's all you have to know?  Norton's doing personal favors for people now on the email.  All right.  Scott.  He's taking his money on the side on the email.  Yeah.  Scott calling from Southie.  Scott, what's up? 
[01:39:30]  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey.  Dennis, what's happening?  What's going on?  Yeah, I just wanted to fill you in on a classic back in the day.  We used to hang on to the projects, and every year at St. Paddy's Day, they'd come out  with green mask, just for the occasion.  Green mask going.  That is classic.  Wow.  Norton, you are an awful man.  Leave it to us, Scott.  Boston.  Well, Dennis, we're going to let you go.  Yeah, hey, guys.  Tonight, 930 ABC, next week, same thing, and I say it's this weekend. 
[01:40:00]  Absolutely.  And, you know, and I'll be back on soon to talk about the firefighters and whatever the  hell else I have, and I think Adam Ferrara's going to call you guys in a little bit.  Oh, hell yeah.  You know what?  Hold on.  This guy's been dying to get through.  Who is it?  When you said fire.  Lewis.  Lewis!  Yeah, how you doing, Dennis?  Hey.  What's up, guys?  I just, I'm a firefighter.  I'm working down the trade center out.  Hey.  I can't thank you enough for all the stuff that you've done.  Well, we've got a lot more stuff we're going to do, so.  Yeah.  I just, when I've seen you in interviews, I know you can't speak enough about us guys, 
[01:40:30]  and just thanks a lot.  Well, we appreciate what you guys are doing, man.  So, we've got to make a lot more noise and try to fill in that $60 million gap they created  by taking away that money out of your budget.  Yeah, that was great timing on that one.  Yeah, I know.  I really don't understand.  Yeah, guys, sorry about everything.  $60 million.  We need it back.  Thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well, he's a businessman.  Yeah.  He could take that money out of his, he's probably rolled up in a sock under his bed.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Maybe the helicopter fuel out to the Hamptons that he uses. 
[01:41:00]  Maybe, you know.  No, it was six houses.  You know?  And I just, I wanted to say one more thing.  The show is great, but the Viagra one, my girlfriend just did not like.  Really?  Why not?  Oh, she was, I don't, you know what it was between the mistress and the wife?  Yeah.  She's like, oh, she was not happy about that.  Dennis, the way your character screws up with your girlfriend and your wife, I sit there  and go, you are a jackass.  Yeah, I know.  Like, you can't even play it right. 
[01:41:30]  I know.  He's got, you got a pretty ideal situation there with the side girlfriend who, she's  kind of bitchy a lot, but it seems like she's going to be there no matter what.  And she's hot.  Yeah.  And you still screw it up.  I know.  He winds up leaving and having to call the wife and like trying to get with her.  Yeah.  To get the effects of the Viagra taking care of.  And he lets the girlfriend hear him talking to the wife.  You're ridiculous.  I love it.  With the green tongue from drinking the NyQuil.  All right, guys.  All right, man.  Talk to you soon.  Take care, Dennis. 
[01:42:00]  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  There he goes.  Dennis Larry.  There you go.  The job.  9.30.  Tonight.  LBC.  Tonight.  I think we'll finally get to Lewis.  Nah, I'm going to leave here shortly.  Do you got to leave now?  Yeah, I do.  He's got to tape the daily.  I got to leave the daily.  I got like five more minutes.  Oh, my God.  And we're going into a break.  We've done nothing with you.  You got to tell him that I'm at the stress factory.  Wait a minute.  Stress factory.  Yeah, well, I saved all my good stuff, so I can just tell them they'll do it at the  club.  When are you at the stress factory?  Tomorrow and Friday and Saturday. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've been hanging for an hour waiting to talk, and you really have to leave.  Yeah, but I don't care.  I love coming in here.  It's like I feel like I separated from reality, and then I go back.  How about you give us a little something?  Well, I can give you a little something.  What's bothering you today?  How about the terrorists getting their...  Oh, getting their visas?  Do you hear about that?  Do you believe that?  Isn't that great?  Perfect.  I think it's perfect.  I think it's absolutely perfect.  Our government at work, you know?  So screwed up that after everything, somebody had to put that, at least type it into a computer. 
[01:43:00]  Mohammed Atta.  They had to type it in for a visa and send it out and never realize that that was the  terrorist that died and killed people.  Never crossed their mind, never was seen along the way, you know?  No, never picked up a red flag thrown up somewhere.  Or maybe, how screwed up would this be, it didn't happen.  Oh.  When we look out the window.  Maybe if they'd actually gotten them these visas, they'd be back, and we'd start over.  We hit a warp in time. 
[01:43:30]  That would make more sense than to completely miss it.  And I also like the fact they were getting ready to nuke everything.  Right.  That seems to be bubbling to the surface.  Oh, that's good.  Lewis, if you remember, this was my strategy right from the beginning.  It's always been Yemen, but you were Yemen.  I was Yemen, and you see, we got people in Yemen.  Yes, we did.  They're fighting.  Remember?  Why not Yemen?  It's very coerced.  You're absolutely right.  But I like the idea of scaring these little dirty bastards with the nuclear weapon. 
[01:44:00]  Yep.  With the nuclear bomb.  Yep.  I always like that.  I always like holding that up as something that we should do.  Because you know what?  Yeah.  Because I always like to see, you know, more beachfront property.  Well, whatever it takes, Lewis.  Whatever it takes.  Whatever it takes.  Whatever it takes.  We're not talking about bombing countries.  Whatever it takes.  We're not talking about nuking countries that have the ability to nuke guns.  Look, it's one thing if you can contain this.  If they're willing to make a nuclear weapon that they think is just going to, like, spritz  in a small area, I get it.  But if you remember, schmucko, if you see those things from the 40s where they're kind 
[01:44:30]  of doing the test, and those idiots are standing out there in sunglasses.  Atmospheric tests.  Looking at a thing.  A mushroom cloud that's, like, 10 feet away, and the wind's going right to their head.  You know, until they kind of, like, figure it out a little.  You just send dental equipment over.  Why don't we just stoke them that way?  That's right, the pigs.  They understand we did drop two nuclear bombs on Japan.  I know that.  And look, no one's worse for wear now.  It's not all that bad. 
[01:45:00]  Hello?  What?  You.  You are worse for wear.  You wouldn't be doing this.  You wouldn't have been doing this.  If what?  You'd have been a Nobel Prize winning scientist.  I, if only I was alive to participate in the nuclear program.  You didn't have to be.  You didn't have to be.  Your parents breathe out and then, and then, boom, sperm meets egg.  And we end up with you?  Yes, but I'm saying we've nooked people.  We could do it again.  We certainly could.  I just said a precedent. 
[01:45:30]  I just think, you know, put up some lead walls before you do it.  All right?  That's a good, it's kind of a good idea.  I'll take it under advisement.  Do we go after Saddam?  Saddam Hussein in Iraq.  What do you think?  What do you think, Louis?  I have no...  Where do we go next?  I think, well, it's obvious we go after Saddam.  Oh.  Or, what we do is we put a dome over Israel and Palestine.  Let them do that.  And say, we'll come back when you're ready to talk.  Call it Thunderdome?  Call it Thunderdome. 
[01:46:00]  Because they have totally lost their grip.  Two countries in, one country leave?  Yeah, or is a gentleman in Central Park said the other day, allow the Palestinians to  open casinos and the Israelis will gamble there and we're done.  How simple is that?  I like it.  It makes the most sense.  Oh, man.  I'm just going to start.  He's got to go.  I know.  I've got to go to the show.  All right, hold on.  This guy is doing great with the show.  I know I'm doing great.  Why the attitude?  Well, the attitude is just I've got to leave.  I'm frustrated. 
[01:46:30]  I was having fun here.  Fred, what's up?  Yo, Louis, don't go yet.  Your take on Grand Theft Auto 3 had me rolling.  The whole take on video games in general, you were incredible.  You were a genius.  Thank you.  One of the funniest things you've ever done, even over the radio.  On TV, had me rolling on the radio the next day.  It was incredible.  Yeah, we're starting to replay the Back in Black.  That's true.  It's five minutes less radio we have to worry about.  Oh, let's hear it again.  Louis, I'm going to ask you a question about the Daily Show.  Mike, I don't know if you want to answer or not. 
[01:47:00]  Yes.  Have you gotten a lot of emails or stuff from people that say, I kind of like Stephen Colbert  as the guy.  John now, I like John.  Don't get me wrong.  John is taking on this persona that's a little bigger than it was when he first started.  Yeah, John's moved up.  Yeah.  John's moved up that ladder.  And he seems to take many opportunities letting everybody know he has.  That's all I'm going to say.  I see Stephen Colbert does the show when John's away. 
[01:47:30]  And I find myself enjoying it a little more than I do when John's on.  Have you heard anything?  I haven't heard because I don't have a kind of a Jim Norton website where people are constantly...  Well, you know where Jim is constantly in communication with half the universe.  He absolutely is.  He's the pinnacle of a whole universe.  I care about my people that don't enjoy my thing.  I care about...  Shut up.  You do not.  Stop it.  I want them to have a way to come and see me at town hall on April 18th.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Nice. 
[01:48:00]  Nice plug.  April 18th.  It's a little far in advance, I think.  A little far in advance.  Oh, my gosh.  We might have some dirt on Lewis Black.  Please.  John, what's up?  Yeah, I was down in Florida last week for Bike Week and I heard a commercial on the radio.  Yeah.  Like a Florida-style White Castle hamburger joint.  Exactly.  Lewis was hawking these things.  What's up with that?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I told you this.  I'm the voice of Crystal Burgers.  You are the voice of Crystal Burgers?  I'm the guy.  Wow.  They don't even sell them up here. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, exactly.  That's no dirt.  I've actually...  No, we've got to get a commercial.  I've got to get a copy of this.  You've got to get a copy of it.  It's unbelievable.  What's truly amazing is a southern, truly southern institution that serves really a White  Castle burger, but they call it Crystals, has hired a Jew to be the voice, a New York  Jew, to be the voice of their burger.  It's psychotic.  The last thing I did, I'm selling corn pups.  That's a hot dog on a stick with cornbread around it. 
[01:49:00]  Cornmeal stuff around it.  Fried.  Perfect.  And where's that salt?  You're a white trash.  Where is that salt, Lewis?  Are you kidding?  That salt in Alabama, Mississippi, all...  Yeah.  Same place.  Now the Jew boy's going to tell you about a new hot dog.  It's exactly it.  Come on, New York Jew boy.  Chili cheddar, cheddar, chili.  He's in that tree.  You know?  Look at the new Dave Thomas.  You're like...  I am.  I'm the Dave Thomas of Southern Cracker Foods.  It's unbelievable.  Dude, how great was it when he died? 
[01:49:30]  Oh.  Let's be honest here.  Quit fooling around.  He's stunk.  No charisma.  Thanks for coming by.  Lewis, get off the floor.  Well, that was funny.  All right, John.  We're going to find that commercial and play it on our show.  Oh, I can't wait.  I've got to hear this now.  All right.  Really bad.  Any other things in your mind?  That's about it today?  That's it.  Just that I'll be going on April 18th to Town Hall. 
[01:50:00]  Yes.  To see Jim Norton.  And then just that I'll be at the Stress Factory Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  And then next week I'll be by probably to harass you guys.  And the Daily Show.  So, the Daily Show tonight.  What kind of subjects are you hitting on tonight?  Tonight, digital.  Digital, right.  We're digitizing all this stuff.  Oh, that's right.  He mentioned that earlier.  Yep.  Yeah, we forgot to mention that on our show.  They had a James Bond movie and they put the bra in.  They put the bra in.  Why is that?  This is a movie that gets, you know, this is one of the movies that gave me one of my 
[01:50:30]  first, you know, chubbies watching the movie.  And then they took it out.  She had a nice little dress on, no bra, and they made a black bra.  They made a black bra.  Because you know how kids will go.  They'll go insane when they get visions.  Well, is Drew Barrymore offended by that, too?  Yeah.  But the E.T. thing is even more amazing.  But the great one is the ending, which is the reason I actually have to go.  The ending tonight is going to be classic.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Could I just say they might be digitizing something?  They might be digitizing something.  Oh, right.  You're not going to be topless again, are you?  Oh, no, no.  This time you'll be able to hold your lunch. 
[01:51:00]  Are they going to put Triple H's body on you?  No, this is better.  This is better.  You'll love this.  Poops?  No, this is better.  Let's just tune in, right?  You'll like this.  The big tease.  You will like this.  Yeah?  All right.  The grand finale of Back in Black tonight?  Yeah, it's a good one.  They're going to put you in a tub with Andrea Yates?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  You're a horrible, horrible, awful man.  Mercurio came up, I think, with this one.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So it's maybe even an Emmy Award winning conclusion? 
[01:51:30]  Possibly.  I've seen his Emmy Award.  He brought it in.  I know he did.  He carries it with him everywhere.  He walks around with him.  He actually doesn't wear underwear.  He actually straps it to his legs.  His genitals are in the car.  Yeah, it's holding it.  Emmy, herself, is holding up his junk.  It's holding up his junk.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable to watch.  You're not the voice of snowman dolls, are you?  No, but I will be.  Okay.  If the price is right, you know, I will be.  And really fast, because it hit the papers here in New York. 
[01:52:00]  You just interviewed John McCain and Bob Dole.  Yeah, I did.  How was that?  It was actually, what was amazing is, I finished the interview, and I said, you know, you guys  should be doing my show.  You should just do the show.  I'll produce it.  Dole is a seriously funny man.  It's amazing when you, you know, you go, where was this guy?  Where was his personality?  The personality, yeah, during the election.  From the moment he walked in the room, he was seriously funny.  Everything, everything was like a setup, boom.  He was, everything he said was funny. 
[01:52:30]  He said, literally, you know, that reminds me of when I was, you know, we were talking,  he said, I brought up something, you know, about, you know, gentlemen, don't let this  tax your memory, because I'm doing this thing on taxes.  And he was in the Senate making a speech, don't let this tax your memory.  And Kennedy yells out, you know, well, that's not a bad idea.  Maybe we should start taxing memories.  And then he goes on for two minutes about it.  And then he's turning to his, he turns to his dog, and he says, you see him, he's got  a dog, like, flipping around next to him.  He goes, that's a deduction.  That dog is a solid deduction. 
[01:53:00]  I mean, he was, he's lost his mind, is what you're saying.  But he was seriously funny.  Did he complain about the key for the strawberries, and he knew there was one?  Strawberries.  How many portions did you have?  And McCain, and McCain was, McCain said some stuff about, about taxes that I said, you  know, I say that in clubs, and, and I do it to get, to get laughs, and that means if  I just kind of cut out the laughs, I could be a senator.  You could be a politician.  And it never crossed my mind.  Did you interview them both together? 
[01:53:30]  No.  Oh, you should have done it both together and called the segment Three Good Arms.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  See, you're horrific.  Yeah, that's the reason.  You're horrific.  That was horrific.  Jesus.  Well, you got to remember which one to, you know, you got to be there.  You got to remember which one to shake.  I tell you that.  Could you sign, oh, there, here, here, here.  I'm wondering what's wrong with one of Lewis's arms now.  One, two, three.  Don't, and now he, he became the elephant man.  You know what would have worked out? 
[01:54:00]  You said Bob Dole showing his personality, and this, I truly believe, would have worked  for him.  When he fell off of that stage, remember that whole episode?  It was caught on, you know, all kinds of cameras rolling, and he just collapsed, falls off the  stage.  If he would have just looked into one of the many news cameras that were around and just  went, live from New York, it's Saturday night.  How funny would it have been?  I mean, I'd have voted for him just on that alone.  Maybe he's not a...  The pratfall.  But you're, he's not thinking as quick as you are comedically.  Why does he just do a brilliant Tyson impression, too? 
[01:54:30]  No, I'm just thinking that if he's a funny guy with personality, that probably would have  put it away for him.  You know how American people are.  He did a joke, cha-ching, pull the lever.  I vote for him.  But McCain, I have to say at the end, they set us up in a, in his Senate conference room.  He came in and did the interview.  And then at the end, you know, my producer said, can you, would you work with Lewis here  for a second?  And we do this bid in there.  And he was great at it.  Really?  It was like, it was amazing.  And then they left us in the room alone. 
[01:55:00]  And I kept thinking, I'm in a Senate, I'm in the Senate room.  It's an investigative room.  You know, it's where you come in.  It's the Senate committee room.  It's Commerce Committee.  I could have, I'm sitting here going, you know, should I really just, you know, have  them just, I got a camera there.  You know, I could be walking around this room buck naked.  You know, there was like 50 things.  Nobody was watching over us.  I'm going, this is nuts.  They, you know, it was like, and then I thought, boy, as soon as I take my pants down to do  something stupid, they'll be in here in a second.  But no anthrax in there?  Nothing.  No, the whole place is anthrax. 
[01:55:30]  It's all clean.  Did you do any white powder jokes?  And I'll tell you this, it was easier to get in the Senate than it is to get in here.  Yeah, see?  You know?  That it is to get in our city.  It is a stupid building.  They gave me no pass.  I didn't have to wait until somebody typed my name out.  Martha.  Yes?  Why are you still listening to us?  I'm not listening to you.  I just want to tell you, it's pretty pathetic.  Yesterday, those stupid women on the phone would be in there.  That's pretty pathetic.  I want you guys to be in that barrel so you can make your little weenies a little bit  prettier. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, Martha's calling back.  Martha wants to be a character.  Martha wants to be part of the Opie and Anthony show.  No, I don't want to be part of Opie and Anthony.  You guys are disgusting.  What's your name, fat body?  You try to make your point, and now you're calling back to be a little character.  Maybe if enough of us call up, maybe your boss will key in you guys.  Keep listening, Martha.  You listen every day.  Martha, thanks for interrupting my segment, Martha.  Right.  You interrupted Lewis's segment.  I'm supposed to leave, and then you come in and interrupt, and don't even try it again. 
[01:56:30]  We're pathetic.  It's my segment right now, okay?  Got it?  Back off.  Whatever.  Well, well, right, right.  Yeah, whatever.  I'm blocking you now.  I'm blocking you.  No one can hear you.  No one can hear anything you're saying.  Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.  How do you talk that fast? 
[01:57:00]  How much crack are you on to be able to speak this quickly?  I do this for all living, for God's sake.  How much do you want from us?  Nope.  You'll have to stop.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to tackle.  I'm going to keep tackling.  Yeah, it's fun to tackle with you idiot.  You want to be a character, don't you, you little fat, lonely whore?  You want to be a character.  Whatever.  Whatever, whatever, whatever.  Tuck your socks in, fat girl.  Tuck your stretchy pants into your socks, fatso.  Than what they really are, and then for sure you won't have a woman that would want you. 
[01:57:30]  No, I do not.  Your awful, birth-giving body.  No one would ever, ever want you.  Because your weenies are tinier than what they usually are.  Want you?  Do you have to talk white trash?  Want you?  Yeah, because you can't.  It's want you, fatso.  You talk white trash.  What do you mean?  Want you?  Stop with the W-A-N-C-H-A, one-shot.  You guys have white trash.  Are you talking about me?  Speak proper English.  All right, there she goes.  You blubbering nothing.  Well, I do have to go. 
[01:58:00]  You know what?  We called that.  We called it, though.  Oh, we know she listens every day.  Can you picture her?  She said she'll never listen again.  She knew what we did yesterday.  She's listening today.  Of course she is.  Twinkie-eating slob.  And we're driving her in New York.  Self-hating fan of the show.  No, she's from Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  And Martha, next time you're out, buy your kids Crystal Burgers.  Yes.  Yes.  Lewis, it's always a pleasure.  Hey, thanks, guys.  Just listen to the money lender.  He'll tell you what to eat.  Crystal Burgers.  Hey, Jew boy, what do you like on yours, Matzo? 
[01:58:30]  Crystal, that's code word for crass killer.  Wow.  That is good.  Can I address something real quick?  Yes.  Because this is some feedback.  This is why I...  This is from Lieutenant Reverend.  Hey, plug whore.  I just tried to go to eatabullet.com and it come up address not found.  Nice head, Deke.  Hey, stupid.  Eat a bullet is E-A-T-A-B-U-L-L-E-T, not I-T.  Bullet is not B-U-L-L-I-T. 
[01:59:00]  Dummy.  Hey, Martha, your husband wrote in.  All right, Lewis, have fun.  We'll see you next time.  Oh, we're not going to be here next week.  Vacation, so.  Oh, good for you.  Do you need anything?  Do you want us to plug something?  No, that's it.  Just the stress.  All right.  I'll be in San Francisco if you're out there.  What's the number?  I think we're on in San Francisco.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have fun.  I don't know the number.  You know I don't.  732-545-HA-HA.  Ha-HA.  H-A-HA for Lewis Black Tickets. 
[01:59:30]  Thanks, guys.  All right, Lewis Black, everyone.  And Stephen Lynch next.  Yes.  The guest just backing up today.  Fun-filled.  He's going to sing the bowling song that we were talking about earlier.  Oh, I can't wait.  Thanks, Lewis.  And he's got a brand new song, too.  Very cool.  We'll do that next.  Хорошо.  Спасибо.  Whip, whip, whip, whip.  The getir classy.  Whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip.  The getir lotus säger.  What the fuck, yo?  Opie and Anthony.  Man, what a day. 
[02:00:00]  Fun-filled.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We have too much going on today.  This never happens.  I know.  You know, Froy is checking in about Lewis doing the Crystal Burgers commercial down there in Florida.  He goes, Crystal Burgers, that's one step below being a mini-wheat.  Ouch.  And Nora is not here.  I like the mini-wheat commercials.  Come on.  I'm the frosted side.  All right.  You know, it's whipping out Wednesday. 
[02:00:30]  Yes, it is.  We're so busy, we haven't been able to talk about that.  Well, we don't touch on it all that much because the nice weather isn't around.  But we do like reminding people that it is there.  The nice weather's on the way here in New York, Anthony.  Yes.  And it's coming back bigger than ever.  Wow.  In the meantime, if you go to foundrymusic.com, there's lots of wow going on on the website.  There's a wow me section where girls all over the country are, you know, sending in pictures of themselves topless.  Wowing.  There's some really good ones up right now. 
[02:01:00]  Go to foundrymusic.com.  The wow me section.  I hope you know what wow is by now.  Do we need to waste time on that?  No, I'm pretty sure everyone knows.  You put wow in your car.  If the girls feel like it, they'll flash you.  That's the sign that you want to see boobies.  Wow, what is this?  I feel like I should be roller skating.  Sound like a big flying saucer should be coming down.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027. 
[02:01:30]  Anywhere else outside of New York, 866-2774.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, Stephen Lynch has been waiting an hour and a half to get on the show.  Louis Black waited an hour and we didn't even do anything with him.  And we couldn't even speak to him.  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks, Triple H.  Ah, there he is.  You know how the show started today?  3 o'clock.  Let's see.  What did we do?  It seems like we were talking about this days ago, but we were talking about Stephen Lynch 
[02:02:00]  and the...  Did you hear us talking about you?  See, I knew he was listening.  Damn it.  We were talking about all of your fantastic songs that we have been playing over the years  on this very program.  And how...  Tens of songs.  How we have...  You did hear the...  Ones and tens of songs.  You did hear the good stuff, right?  How, like...  Yeah.  A tribute.  I already knew you didn't like that song.  Because if you recall, when I called you guys from Washington, D.C., having just done 
[02:02:30]  the Kennedy Center for all those kids.  Yeah.  And I was saying, yeah, you know, I don't really have any family type songs.  And you go, oh, didn't you have a cute little bowling song once?  Was there sarcasm in that when he said it?  What?  You picked up on the sarcasm?  Yeah.  Crazy, right?  It's kind of cool that we could have an open discussion about this one way.  I like the bowling song.  They're not all winners, you know?  I like the bowling song.  Sometimes you get brown sugar.  Sometimes you get...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Between a rock and a hard place.  What are you going to do?  Lynching.  We said we liked every song you did except one. 
[02:03:00]  That's great.  I can't think of another song we did not like.  I still...  Even Lennon had some maybe that he wasn't happy with or didn't...  You know, even Ozzy there.  Norton probably had a tune.  That's a grateful example.  I'm sorry.  Bad example.  Sorry.  In the middle of his syndicated program.  And you don't even watch that show last night?  I couldn't.  You didn't watch it.  I was performing in Delaware.  What am I going to do?  Turn down money?  A VCR, my friend.  No, I don't have one.  It's in the end.  A VCR is broken.  Let me tell you something about...  And so is my DVD player. 
[02:03:30]  Can I explain something to you about the 21st century that we live in?  Can I explain just a little tidbit of something to you, Norton?  Yes, Ozzy.  Back in the older days, the older days of the top-loading VCR, that was the size of  a Conestoga wagon.  And it was just as heavy.  With the most colorful buttons on it.  Colorful buttons, if you're lucky.  Some of them even had channel changers on them.  It was an actual channel changer.  Top-loader was...  I mean, the mechanism used to lift the tape out was akin to the elevator used to lift 
[02:04:00]  F-16s onto the flight decks of aircraft carriers.  This is how intricate this machinery was when this stuff first came out.  And when they broke, and when they broke, you took it to your local handy-dandy TV repairman,  and he fixed it with various tools in his craft and techniques and expertise.  And he returned it to you, good as new, for you to use until perish the thought it broke  again where you would take it to be repaired again. 
[02:04:30]  But no one fixes VCRs anymore.  Thank you, Opie.  That's what I was getting to in my long-winded explanation.  No one fixes these.  When it breaks, you know what you do with it?  You get no one.  You have fun kicking it out your door.  You're trod to the Wiz or any other numerous electronics places.  You put down $25, and you pick up another one.  They're dirt cheap.  You're having fun just poking fun at me?  I poke, poke, poke.  I had the VCR broke, and here's what happened.  The audio was still really good, but only on certain videos. 
[02:05:00]  The video, I mean, was good, but the audio would go,  and you couldn't hear the sound.  Right.  But the video was pretty good, and then my DVD player broke,  so I have nothing to watch these things on,  and I'm not going to mention any blonde-haired names of people.  Do you know how inexpensive these things are?  They were going to help me get a nice VCR-DVD combo for my new place.  Ah, look at you.  From the fine folks at Samsung.  I have no idea.  I don't know.  Samsung.  I never own one of those.  I may just go out and buy two new videos.  That's a great little device.  You know what?  Get the TiVo. 
[02:05:30]  That's what I have.  TiVo.  Very good.  Digital.  Unbelievable.  You could do rewind.  You could rewind programming.  But I will watch the Osborne.  You pause it when people are in the middle of making funny faces.  It's hours of entertainment.  And you could watch the show, and if you've got to take a leak, you're not going to worry  about missing it.  You hit pause, and you go take a leak.  And you come back and watch it.  So you saw the Osbournes?  It's the best show on television.  It really is.  Did you talk about this already?  No.  No, not really today.  I thought the best part of the whole thing was when he goes, I feel invisible again. 
[02:06:00]  It was the again part.  I know.  Like he was putting on a cape, running around going, oh, Sharon, see me today.  He's all invisible.  Sharon!  He is the sorriest son of a bitch.  I feel so bad.  There he is.  Ozzy friggin' Osborne.  Rockstar.  And he is tortured by a wife that is filling some void in her life with small mammals  that run around the house. 
[02:06:30]  Two children that could not give a crap he's Ozzy Osborne, and Amor just embarrassed by  the fact that he's Ozzy.  It's a horror show.  And this poor guy walks around in his robe.  Did you see him coloring that thing?  That was a big coloring book.  Like he's drawing something with crayons and coloring, and it was awful.  You know what?  It's very cute, but it's Ozzy.  You're talking about a grown man.  Because in the first episode, they say he's an artist.  No, he's coloring books. 
[02:07:00]  I have seen celebrities that do paintings, and you're like, wow, there's a double talent  the person's got.  They're an actor, a musician, and an artist.  Ozzy doing this is like worse than your chick coming up with your band logo in junior  high on the cover of her notebook.  It was that quality.  Sharon, I didn't go outside the lines.  Yeah, I can't keep it in the lines.  It's a catastrophe.  And he doesn't blink.  He just doesn't. 
[02:07:30]  He's got the look of a retarded old man.  That is really starting to freak me out.  He walks like he's a stroke victim.  He can't even walk.  Well, that's because he's got a busted foot or something.  He's hobbling about.  There's the Osborne mansion being crapped on and leaked all over by more animals than I  can count.  And he just goes around complaining and yelling and screaming and coloring because he's got  nothing else to do.  The man has no responsibility in his life.  None.  Have you noticed there is nothing he does?  He walks around. 
[02:08:00]  I've seen him walk.  I've seen him try to turn on the vacuum cleaner.  To turn on the vacuum cleaner.  I'm going mad.  And then he's coloring.  Coloring?  This is what his life is.  It was touring the country, doing more drugs than you could even imagine.  And what's his life now?  He walks around like an old woman that just got out of the shower.  When he had the robe on and his hair was up, and he sat down and I thought we were going  to see some tattooed Aussie yambang fall out of his robe.  I was horrified. 
[02:08:30]  I actually blocked my eyes for a second.  It was close.  Oh, it was.  I don't think you could be any closer.  Why'd you block your eyes?  Because it wouldn't be big and uncut like the ones on Oz?  That's small and British.  Who needs that one?  It's white.  Hey, we got some clips from Ozzy last night.  Rockstar doesn't pick up turds.  Why can't we get like, you know, people get like lassie toes and dogs that do tricks.  Remind you, I'm not picking up another turd. 
[02:09:00]  I'm a rockstar.  I'm a rockstar.  I'm not picking up another turd.  I'm a rockstar, man.  You have a lassie type dog that does tricks.  He's the greatest man ever.  He wants a lassie type dog.  The show needs subtitles, though.  You got to watch it two or three times and I'm up on everything.  I felt so bad for him.  He pleaded with his wife not to get another cat.  It was just like, please, I'm begging you.  It's Ozzy.  I'm begging you.  Promise me you're not going to get another cat.  Promise me.  Please, Sharon, don't. 
[02:09:30]  And she's leaving.  And he's like, please, don't get another cat.  And what does she do?  Gets another goddamn cat.  At the end of the show, when Ozzy's looking at the table, and for that split second, his face is, am I seeing double again?  Like, he didn't quite figure it out.  He thought maybe he was just seeing the cat in double vision.  And then he realized it was two cats.  And he goes yelling for his wife again.  Half the show is him running from a room, yelling his wife's name.  He goes, Sharon!  Did you hear how proud he was of the little joke that he made when the cat lady? 
[02:10:00]  The cat lady named Tamara comes over.  She's leaving.  He goes, Ozzy, say goodbye to Tamara.  I said, see you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  Get it.  Get it.  See you.  Get it.  He's so happy.  And then when...  That's a good joke.  Oh, Jesus.  No idea.  Another great part with Tamara, the girl.  She was brought in.  She's a trainer for the dogs.  A therapist.  Yeah, therapist.  So they don't take a crap and leak all over the antique rugs. 
[02:10:30]  So she's talking with Ozzy's wife.  And she's ready to leave.  And she goes, well, we'll work on housebreaking.  Because the dog, right when she was leaving and she was saying how good the dog was,  the dog then took a leak on one of the rugs.  Right.  So the wife then tells Ozzy, she goes, oh, Tamara was here.  And she was talking about what a good dog the dog is for not taking a leak.  And she leaked on the rug.  And then Ozzy goes, who?  Thinking for a second in his head, maybe Tamara, like, for some reason, took a leak on his rug. 
[02:11:00]  We got Ozzy checking in.  Yes, Jim?  Before he...  The thing about Ozzy that's beautiful is that he would show this part of himself.  The man just doesn't stop giving music for 30 years.  And then most rock stars are too arrogant to do this.  This program is hysterical, isn't it?  He doesn't care.  He doesn't.  He doesn't stop giving.  It's obvious because he's a lunatic, retarded old man right now.  All right.  Ozzy!  Hello, guys.  How are you? 
[02:11:30]  What's up, Ozzy?  What's up?  First of all, I'd like to clear the air right off the bat.  I had...  I'd never in my life thought that Kelly would bring home freaking Elijah Wood, man.  Yeah, you had Elijah Wood in your house, Ozzy.  Oh, you know, I was two seconds of kicking his house, you know, at the door, but I had  to...  The cameras were on.  I had to be civil, you know.  Why don't you like Elijah Wood?  It didn't even seem like you knew who he was, Ozzy.  Oh, you know, I don't know. 
[02:12:00]  I saw Lou of the Rings.  I mean, it was big talk, whatever, so I went to see it, you know.  It was a little long, you know.  Now, I can't pay attention to something more than, you know, a few minutes, and you got  to be in there for three hours, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ozzy, we got to ask you about, what the hell were you coloring?  Oh, you know, I'll do my own artwork every now and then, you know.  That's artwork?  That's a coloring book.  Because, like you guys said, you know, sometimes I have a lot of time on my hands, you know. 
[02:12:30]  But, you know, between that, I also set up a side project, Ben, but, you know, I also  like to do, I also like to do artwork, you know.  I've seen, Ozzy, I'm not saying the artwork's really that bad, but I've seen better stuff  hanging on refrigerators at retards' houses.  So have I, man.  And we almost saw your yam bag last night.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I like to throw a little skin in every now and then, you know.  A little skin, yeah, a little too much. 
[02:13:00]  Those tats seemed like a good idea back in the day.  Now it just looks like someone threw ink-soaked towels at you.  Yeah, well, you know, I was thinking, you know, the tattoos redone, you know, make it  look a little more presentable, but, you know, I don't know, man.  Ozzy, it seems like you're very bored.  All I can see, is it true in the next couple of weeks you're actually making an ashtray  and gluing macaroni to it and spray-painting it gold? 
[02:13:30]  No, man, that's something stalker.  Macaroni art?  Nothing like that?  A picture frame out of macaroni?  They haven't gotten to that point yet, man.  No, you seem very bored, and there doesn't seem to be...  It's that there doesn't just seem to be much to do for Ozzy at his house.  You know, you've got the big video games and pinball machine, whatever, but, you know,  after a little while, I guess it loses flavor, but, you know, I mean, Sharon, you know, 
[02:14:00]  she's always bringing goddamn animals home, you know.  I see, that's a big problem with you, Ozzy.  They're messing up your beautiful Beverly Hills house.  They are, man.  And, you know, they go crapping all over the place and, you know, stinking up the house,  you know, and it keeps you busy, you know, following the dogs around.  I would say, yes, thank God you have the dogs, because then you'd have absolutely nothing to do.  That's what I'm catching from this.  If you didn't have the dogs to chase around and clean up after their crap and whiz, 
[02:14:30]  you would have absolutely nothing to do.  Well, I also have my artwork.  I forgot.  I'm sorry.  I forgot about your artwork and trying to figure out the satellite TV.  Yeah, that's good.  And the way he sits and watches that TV, his eyes just pop out,  and he's looking like a retard looking at a ferris wheel.  Ozzy, when are you going to blink?  You have to stay tuned.  I don't blink much.  No. 
[02:15:00]  No, I'm afraid I'll miss something, because, you know, what happens,  I'll watch a television, you know, and, you know, a big helicopter,  somebody will fly across the street.  Right.  If I blink, I might miss it, you know.  Right.  You know.  You like the History Channel and the War Channels and stuff.  Yeah.  I mean, the World War II shows are fun, you know.  They're good fun.  They're fun to watch, you know.  Good fun for everyone, right?  Yeah.  All right, Ozzy, we're going to let you go, because we don't want to burn you out.  No. 
[02:15:30]  Okay.  Say hi to everybody out there in St. James, Long Island, where Ozzy resides.  Okay, guys.  Hi, everybody in St. James.  I'll talk to you guys, you know, another time.  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  All right.  Bye, Oz.  There he goes.  Bye.  The greatest caller in the history of the world.  Ozzy.  It's amazing.  The man just doesn't stop giving.  You can't hang up on Ozzy?  What's wrong with your phone?  There he goes.  Okay.  When we get back, we've got a couple tunes from Stephen Lynch.  And hopefully, first, are we going to hear the bowling song? 
[02:16:00]  What?  You have to play the bowling song.  Are you going to play that once?  No.  Wait, wait.  I saw the less than stellar reception.  Stephen, here's the problem.  Why won't I play it again?  Here's the problem.  It's something only you can solve.  Let me guess.  You don't have a history, a recording of it anywhere, right?  We don't.  What a shame.  We were talking about it at the top of the show.  And how are we going to make fun of the song when you're not here if we don't have a copy?  All right.  I'm going to play the song for you.  But don't make me play it first.  At least let me start off with something decent. 
[02:16:30]  All right.  But we're thinking if you play that, then just imagine how the new song is going to be pushed.  I've got a couple new songs.  I'll play it in between.  Oh, see?  That's kind of sandwiching in there.  There you go.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Start big, and then you can, like, ease off a little bit and finish big.  I like it.  Taper, if you will.  Taper?  Taper.  Rascal.  You're stored taper.  How old are you?  18.  How old are you?  How old are you?  Wow.  Fabulous.  Wow.  Holy ravioli. 
[02:17:00]  Mopey and Anthony.  Packed house today on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes.  Steven Lynch tuning up his guitar.  We're going to get to him in a second or two.  I am just, uh, I've got to say something.  There's going to be one.  Sorry, guys.  One less thing we can goof on Opie about.  Why?  Which is kind of, uh, kind of sucks, because it's been a while, but I know that you're  going to the Islander game tonight, and I saw a 12-year-old Gary outside, so I guess 
[02:17:30]  that joke's over.  You're finally taking him to the, uh, to the game.  Uh, what?  Stop it.  Wait a minute.  Dude, I swear.  Come on.  Dude, you just blew up my spot.  Hold it.  What's up, Gary?  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Gary, I, I, it is true I'm going to...  I know.  You said that today you're going to the Islander game after the show.  Uh, well, they're, they're playing in Jersey.  Yeah.  I see Gary here, so I assume... 
[02:18:00]  I assume the Devils tonight in Jersey.  I'm, yes, I am going ass-munch.  Hold it.  Gary, you're not going?  Nope.  Oh, no.  No one's calling me about the game.  So, well, what are you doing here?  I don't know.  I was just gaming.  He, you came to see, uh, Triple H, right?  Oh, is that what you're here for?  See, I thought you were here to...  And, Gary, who said, who said you could come down and see Triple H?  Stinky.  You lying son of a bitch.  You go like Stinky.  Why, you, O.B., are you trying to say that you... 
[02:18:30]  I was responsible for a little Gary, uh, meeting Triple H today.  Oh, I'm not adorable.  And, uh, yes, I am going to the Islander game, you man.  He was not supposed to know about that, though.  I, I assumed...  Thank you, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  I, I just thought, since you were going and he was here, that the reason he was here is...  Hey, it's the Devils.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, that's right.  You sent him to the crappiest team.  Well, he got to see the Sabres.  I beat the crap out of them 5-0. 
[02:19:00]  Right.  I thought you were a Sabres fan.  You should have...  I thought you enjoyed that.  No, but, but you also said I was, uh, how do you say, uh, how do you say, the worst team  around, the hockey team.  How do you say, what country are you from?  It is like how you say in your country...  How do you say in your pre...  Hey, you look off Smirnoff.  How do you say, what the country...  12-year-old Mohammed.  Man, it's the Devils. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  It's that Islander's Devils.  I'm going with, uh, Joey Paisano.  Oh, my God.  You're going with Joey Paisano?  I need a ride.  You don't, you don't drive yet, right?  You're 12.  I need a ride.  Oh, man.  Now Joey's mad at me because he thinks I'm not inviting him.  Yeah, just for a ride.  That's good.  He'll take you for a ride.  Yeah, he will.  Yeah.  Maybe he can take you to his place and put some free food in your face, too, afterwards.  Sounds like a good idea.  Hey, come on.  All right.  We've got to go pick up some mattresses.  There he is. 
[02:20:00]  Joey.  Joey.  Because I'm driving?  Here comes the ride.  What's that all about?  Look, Hopi, it's the ride that's here.  You said you weren't going to be here until 6-30.  Hey, Gary, how about me and you going to the games?  It was here, Hopi.  Yeah.  Your ride's here, Hopi.  You weren't supposed to hear that.  You said you were getting here at 6-30.  Your ride's leaving.  Your ride's leaving.  Hey, Paulie, come on.  We've got to go pick up some mattresses.  Oh, Paulie, you won't see him no more.  Take the cannoli.  Leave the devil tickets. 
[02:20:30]  Hello, Calo.  Are they called Islander tickets, Jim Norton?  They're devil tickets.  No, they're Islander tickets.  They're devil tickets.  Islander tickets.  I don't care.  That's good.  All right.  And there's Joey Paisano.  Now, Mr. Hopi, I'm just trying to drive you to the game.  You're the best friend I ever had.  Driving Mr. Hopi.  All right.  That's great.  How much are you going to tip, Joey, for driving?  You a good tipper?  Give it a little extra effort on the library.  Give him an extra 10 seconds. 
[02:21:00]  You're going to fill out the voucher that he gives you when you get to the venue?  All right.  Who signed this?  Who signed this?  Voucher.  You got to meet Triple H?  How you say voucher.  How you say voucher?  You got to meet Triple H, right?  Yeah.  And you went to a game?  Yeah.  All right.  Leave me alone, kid.  Did you take a picture with Triple H?  Uh, yeah.  Oh, you got a picture with him?  Cool.  That's pretty good.  Very big day for you, right?  Yeah.  You got to meet Triple H.  I'm telling you right now, I got a tip.  You touch your sucker paddy's cane, I think you're going to get the, uh, the big nail curse. 
[02:21:30]  I say, I call it the hooker, the hooker, whatever it's called.  Gary, we don't want to burn you out.  Oh, you stink.  We don't want to burn you out.  All right, guys.  See ya.  Don't want to burn him out.  Let's not burn out 12 years old.  Don't want to, how you say, burn the mouth.  Suck it.  All right, Steven Lynch in the studio.  There you go.  Gary.  Wait, he's, what's your, what tickets you got?  Wrestling tickets.  Oh, we gave you wrestling tickets, too.  Oh.  Well, there you go. 
[02:22:00]  Continental.  But it's non-tele, uh, thanks a lot, Greg.  What?  It's non-televised, so.  So it's kind of, you're pissed off at the tickets.  You're pitching because you have a televised ticket.  It's non-televised wrestling ticket?  That's classic.  Holy S.  You're going to be in the front.  I hear you're going to be in the front row, though.  Yeah, but I ain't bitching.  I was hoping for a box.  I was hoping for a VIP suite.  I get nothing.  The big man suite, I should use. 
[02:22:30]  Hey, hey, Gary, what about them bitches that were in earlier?  Wouldn't take their pants off for Triple H.  Doesn't that suck?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's Triple H, one of the best wrestlers.  You were hoping to get a little anatomy lesson while you were here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nah, he got to see some boobage.  Nah.  I saw you peeking a little bit.  Were you peeking?  Yeah.  I saw you peeking.  I love that.  Opie and Anthony show, contributing to the delinquency of a minor every day.  It's great.  All right, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye there, Gary.  See you, Gary.  Go on to the outside.  All right.  Pass by Opie's ride. 
[02:23:00]  Say hi.  Gary.  Oh, yeah.  And when you go down to Paisano Mulberry Street, right down there in the heart of Little  Italy, ask Joey to drive you somewhere, you get a glass of wine on the house.  Thank you, Anthony.  That'll help my situation.  Free commercial for Paisano's Mulberry Street.  Just ask Joey to drive you somewhere.  He's the one that comes into the restaurant in a full chauffeur regalia.  Not only is his food.  A cap and everything.  Yes, sir.  Right away, sir.  Did you go bad, sir?  Not only is the food good, he's a good driver.  Yes. 
[02:23:30]  You know how Opie loves the park.  Take him through the park.  Bitsaman, Bitsaman.  All right.  Stephen Lynch is here.  What's around the park, Bitsaman?  Yes.  We're running out of show, too.  Stephen Lynch, Opie's window washer.  That's what we call him.  If occasionally Opie needs his windows washed, he calls up Lynch.  Comes up with a squeegee.  Squeegee.  Newspaper and Windex.  Lynch, where are you performing?  I heard some kind of plug there before.  Tomorrow at Rascals in West Orange. 
[02:24:00]  Cool.  And then the next day at Rascals in Ocean Township.  I hate when they do that to you guys.  I know.  It confuses everyone.  It's like, all right, so when is he?  West Orange people?  Tomorrow.  Okay, good.  And?  Ocean Township people?  Day after tomorrow.  Very good.  We like to keep it simple on this show.  Very easy.  And then Governor's in Levittown next weekend.  I don't know.  No, no, no.  Now they're going to be like, what?  What?  I've got to go to Levittown for what?  And Tyke's here, too.  Yeah.  Tyke's here.  He's going to do a couple songs with me. 
[02:24:30]  Yes.  I heard a couple songs, Anthony.  Ah.  A couple, right?  And somewhere in there, my hands are more than one.  What?  You heard that, too?  God damn it.  That just means we love you.  If you don't want me to hear it, you shouldn't broadcast over the, what do you call it?  The radio.  Oh, yeah.  And somewhere in this montage of songs, will we be hearing the bowling song?  If you want to hear it, that's fine.  I've been getting psyched up just by playing this sound. 
[02:25:00]  Was that a bowling pin?  Yeah, it was a bowling ball.  With some pins.  Here it goes.  Look.  Perhaps you could play that throughout my audition.  Throughout the song.  See how that works.  A lot of the other things that I'm pretty sure you're going to be playing.  No, I want to hear the song.  We need a pristine recording of it.  Okay.  All right.  Is this true?  What?  This is horrible, Joey.  Because I don't doubt this at all.  Opie actually has Joey stand in the lobby with a sign that says Hughes on it. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Yes, yes, he does.  Waiting.  I have the cap, but it's outside.  Do you?  You stand there with the cardboard sign, magic markers, Hughes written on it, and you just...  Yeah.  That's awful.  Can we hurry up?  Shoes will shine, too.  Can we hurry up?  I've got a game to go to.  Yeah.  Of course you do.  Where's the Jim Brewer bit?  Okay.  All right.  So what are we starting with today?  A little song I wrote called She Got a Smile.  And I think that's the tentative title anyway.  And it's about something that many guys go through when they go to a bar, hang out, have 
[02:26:00]  a couple drinks, and they see that special lady across the room.  Oh, yes, yes.  You just feel there's some chemistry.  Sure.  Here we go.  And to help me out, my friend Mark Tyke is going to play.  She got a smile, yeah, she got a smile, and she's flashing it right at me.  She got a wink, a wink across the bar, and I know that it's meant to be. 
[02:26:30]  She got a walk, oh, she's walking over, and I think it could be my day.  She got a friend, ooh, she got a friend, now why she's standing in her way.  It's a big fat friend.  Oh, God, there's always one.  Big fat friend.  To wreck my f***ing fun.  Now, baby, baby, baby, if it's boots you want to knock, leave your chubby friend at home 
[02:27:00]  because she's going to block the cast.  Now, I'm afraid of no man, with any I'll contend.  But I cannot compete with your big fat friend.  Big fat friend.  So, big fat friend, ah, we meet again.  You will not leave her alone.  You roll your eyes, make sarcastic comments while you're sucking on a chicken bone. 
[02:27:30]  But that's okay.  You think you won the battle, but I tend to disagree.  See, I know you and your Achilles heel, and he's sitting next to me.  It's my non-discriminating friend.  So, I bet you're a cow.  Non-discriminating friend.  I'll mail you anyhow.  Yeah, I know he smells like whiskey, and he's had a couple rounds.  With every shot of Jaeger, hey, you lose a couple pounds. 
[02:28:00]  Now, baby, baby, baby, bring the evening to an end.  Just you and me and my pal.  And your big fat friend.  Hey, that's all right, man.  Yeah.  Steven Lentz.  Thank you very much.  The name of that song was Martha.  Shut up.  Why are you always going to say things like that about women?  You're degrading.  Ah, ah, ah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Very good. 
[02:28:30]  Thank you.  You can't follow that song with a bowling song, Ant.  Sure.  Seriously.  It wouldn't be right, man.  It wouldn't be right.  You guys are off next week, yes?  Yeah, we need to play all these songs next week.  Including the bowling song.  I've never heard it.  No one has.  We've played it once.  It's a great song.  If we had it on tape, we would have been able to play.  We have Steven Lynch CDs at this point.  We have like three of them.  I know.  Every song he's ever done.  That one didn't make the cut. 
[02:29:00]  It's amazing.  Is it that bad?  No.  Don't answer that, please.  I don't, you know, I don't remember the last time I heard it, so I couldn't, I couldn't  tell you.  It's a bit unorthodox.  It's not the usual, you know.  I do remember after the show, when we went to the office, Opie went, dude, what's with  that bowling song?  Hey, wait a minute.  I've taken enough abuse today.  Hey, come on.  I've got everyone else hating me in the room.  I don't, I think I came in, and I was looking to fill a little time, and I dug into the 
[02:29:30]  bag of old, old songs, and that's just one I came up with.  I kind of liked it.  I, you know, I've been known to toss that big, heavy, round ball.  There were some good, obscure bowling references in the song.  It's chock full of bowlers.  Chock full.  ABC, you know, bowling.  Were there references to that thing that blows the air out to dry your hands?  No, I missed that one.  Damn it.  It's like my favorite part of bowling, a ball return.  Well, damn.  Do we do the bowling song, Ed? 
[02:30:00]  I would, I would hope eventually.  I would have thought Stephen would have had enough beers where he wouldn't really care  about doing the bowling song.  Yeah, what, where did we go wrong?  What happened?  You know, we got a Jager machine in the office.  I'll play the bowling song if you want me to play it.  It's tripping breakers, but it's your show.  You want people tuning out 40 minutes early.  Oh, believe me.  They will not tune out.  They will want to stick around to the end, so the instant feedback and phone calls  can go crazy.  I could play it if I give the disclaimer that it will not be one of the songs I play  tomorrow at Rascals in West Orange. 
[02:30:30]  Or Friday at Rascals in Ocean Township.  Absolutely.  I have a feeling when we play, what did we learn today?  There's going to be a lot of things about Stephen Lynch that they've learned.  Well, yeah.  All right.  I'm afraid.  At this point, I'm surprised you and I have friends.  What's this you and I stuff?  I kind of like this song.  Hey, good cop said he liked the song.  What are you going to do?  Well, it was his turn today.  Damn it.  It used to work, man.  Don't gag.  Don't work.  No more. 
[02:31:00]  They know all our tricks.  Good cop.  Bad cop.  Lewis actually enjoys...  Although I do think Joey is the driver is a ridiculous thing and you should be ashamed  of yourself.  Lewis actually enjoys when we make fun of him now.  I actually have...  Yeah.  One of the other songs that I've played on this show that I'm sure you haven't repeated,  but, you know, I don't want to...  That's the only one.  I think that's the only one.  Really?  Is that the only one?  Yeah.  Wow.  Like every other one we've played.  It's not even...  It's not that bad.  I mean, it's not good, but...  Some of the other ones would suck much more. 
[02:31:30]  Thank you.  That's horrible.  That's a true friend right there.  Yeah.  It really...  All right.  It's Stephen Lynch and the bowling song.  Yeah.  Let's all listen.  So you do want to hear it then.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm looking at a list of all the songs I've played on this show and I don't see it on  here.  It doesn't see Almighty Malachi, the bowling god.  Oh, that's the title.  It's the bowling god.  Right. 
[02:32:00]  All right, Stephen.  I'm sure...  Here you go.  Just let it rip.  Here we go.  This one's for the Don and Mike audience.  All right.  Oh, God.  No.  Steve, please.  I see you guys.  No, Stephen.  Stephen, please sit down.  God damn.  See, that absolutely was the last straw.  You know, I don't even know if I remember the words of the song.  No.  Literally, I haven't played it since that day.  Really?  I was just looking for a little filler and I thought you might enjoy, you know, a song 
[02:32:30]  filled with bowling references.  Okay.  Dude, skip the second verse.  Just go one, three.  One, three.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Forget that you know it's about bowling.  Can you do that?  That's supposed to be kind of a surprise.  I love how many excuses you make.  It's classic.  All right.  Here's the song.  Well, we're waiting.  You watch me on your TV. 
[02:33:00]  Say that my job is easy.  You say I am not athletic.  You think my sport's pathetic.  At this point, you don't know what sport I'm talking about.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  But you can't judge me till you walked a mile in my bowling shoes.  Got a ball that's smooth and all black.  Uh-huh.  Keep it in my favorite ball sack. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  Get a feeling in my soul.  As I finger every hole.  And as I roll the ball, I cry.  Let me bowl and let me die.  I'm almighty Malachi.  The bowling god. 
[02:34:30]  The smell of rosin gets me high.  Kiss those f***ing pins goodbye.  I'm almighty Malachi.  The bowling.  Bowling.  Not a single man will try to beat almighty Malachi.  All who challenge me are slain.  Come on, f***ers, pick a lane.  Marshal Holman, Gary Dickens.  Get in line for your ass kickin'.  John Petraglia, Norm Duke.  You're so lame it makes me puke. 
[02:35:00]  Who among the provost sector dares to don his wrist protector.  Not that pussy Nelson Burton tells me that his wrist is hurtin'.  Well, hey, Mark Roth, hey, Earl the Pearl.  Are you scared to give the ball a hurl?  How about Dick Webber and his son Pete?  I'll turn the mother f***er to cream of weed.  And as I roll the ball, I cry.  Let me bowl, let me die.  I'm almighty Malachi.  The bowling god.  The smell of rosin gets me high. 
[02:35:30]  Kiss those f***ing pins goodbye.  I'm almighty Malachi.  I'm almighty Malachi, the bowling, the bowling god.  The bowling god.  Oh, the bowling pin sound. 
[02:36:00]  I thought you said you forgot some of the words, man.  Seems like you summed that yesterday.  I was stunned by the number of bowling people you know.  Well, I did my research.  You absolutely did.  I didn't even know there were that many.  I don't f*** around.  I obviously.  You know a little too much about bowling.  I don't.  Yeah.  Well, now we have it on tape. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  I just want to point out that even though I knew you were going to make fun of it,  I gave it 110 goddamn percent.  You absolutely did.  I was going to acknowledge that.  Your face was turning red.  There was no holding back on the vocals.  I sang the S out of that song.  That's right.  This is funny.  It's all right.  It's Sally Kramer checking and saying,  that is such a long way to go just to say ball sack.  Who said that?  Sally Kramer.  Sally Kramer. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  That was interesting.  Sally Kramer.  That was interesting.  She is aware of the line around which the entire song was built.  Right.  John saying, forget the bowling balls.  Where are the ping pong balls?  Not only is it bad, it's seven minutes long.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  All right.  Well, some people don't know bowling as much as you do. 
[02:37:30]  It's all right.  I played it for the sole purpose of handing it to you on a silver effing platter.  You certainly don't have to make excuses.  Someone wants to know if you have a curling song.  A curling song.  I could.  I could.  I could update it.  It's just naming off all those professional curlers.  Wouldn't that be something?  Those are real bowlers, by the way.  I didn't doubt it.  I know.  And there's some father and son team there.  The Weber and Pete Weber. 
[02:38:00]  Really?  The Weber.  Yeah.  And I knew Anthony.  Earl Anthony was in that song.  Earl Anthony.  Yeah, see.  Really?  He has one more in him, Ant.  Ah.  Now I'm raring to go.  Yeah.  Please.  I'm taking it you don't want people yelling out for the bowling song tomorrow.  Actually, no.  You know, this is the odd thing.  I know people, you know, you hate the song.  I get tons of email about that song.  It's not that we hate the song.  From the one time it was played on your show. 
[02:38:30]  We love the song.  It's on, you know, Napster, Nutella, or whatever.  And people still, we, we, we, we, we enjoy the song there.  Bowlers from around the world.  How we enjoyed you squirming, but we enjoy the song.  It is funny.  Yes.  That's all right.  Come on.  Hey, it was my pleasure.  Okay.  Thank you.  What song was longer, that one or Alice's Restaurant?  Oh, okay.  The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald. 
[02:39:00]  Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  All right.  One more.  Walk sprang a leak, and I'll tell you about every minute that it took to go down.  About an hour went by, and an inch of water was filling the bills rather quickly.  Jesus Christ, how long?  It was up to their knees after six hours.  The men were starting to panic.  Gee, I gotta take a nap.  Tell me when the water gets up to their neck.  Could you please?  I haven't got to the part where I say, leak, gitchy, goomy. 
[02:39:30]  They patched up the leak, and they thought it would hold, and it lasted another 12 hours.  It did?  Oh, no.  Geez.  They could have swam home rather quickly.  All right.  One more, Lynchy, or what?  Yeah, I gotta go get my lyrics, though.  Ah.  He didn't have to go for the bowling song. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, I did burn.  All those names.  There you go.  Rascals tomorrow night with Stephen Lynch in West Orange.  See, I remembered.  West Orange tomorrow, yeah.  And Ocean Township the day after tomorrow.  That's right.  That would be Friday.  Is this about the strongman event?  Oh, God.  You know, there's, uh, people have been talking a lot about heroes lately.  Yes, yes, Stephen.  The bocce ball players are the true heroes.  Oh, God. 
[02:40:30]  So I wrote a song about this.  You know what, actually, I'm going to dedicate this song to Lil, uh, Gary.  Lil Gary.  We say it with the apostrophe L-I-L.  Lil Gary.  Lil.  Like Abner.  Lil.  Okay, that's fun.  It's cuter that way, isn't it?  This one's for him.  I came down to the breakfast table, felt like I could cry.  I tried so hard but wasn't able to look you in the eye. 
[02:41:00]  For I am feeling so much shame.  Yes, I have brought disgrace.  Can tell I've soiled my good name by the look upon your face.  Well, it seems last night you caught me spanking it.  No use denying it.  Well, I was really cranking it.  It wasn't my fault and it wouldn't be so bad.  If you could just forgive me and talk to me, Dad. 
[02:41:30]  Talk to me, Dad.  No, I didn't hear you enter.  No, I didn't hear the door.  With my hand upon my member and my pants upon the floor.  Now, burnt into your brain is an image you despise.  Like blood and guts and starving kids and Stevie Wonder's eyes.  Well, it seems last night you caught me spanking it.  No use denying it.  I was really cranking it.  Well, dry your eyes and don't be so sad.  But I wouldn't use those tissues. 
[02:42:00]  They've already been had.  Talk to me, Dad.  Yeah, the look upon your face made my swollen gland diminish.  So I said, could you close the door?  I really want to finish.  Now to Daddy, I'm ashamed to not completely understand.  If you never want to hug again or even shake my hand.  Well, it seems last night you caught me spanking it.  No use denying it.  Well, I was really cranking it.  Well, please calm down and don't get mad. 
[02:42:30]  Just because it was your bed.  It's not that bad.  It's not that bad.  Not that bad.  Talk to me, Dad.  When I was only 17, you told me it was dirty.  So it must be really creepy when your kid is pushing 30.  But you cannot tell me that you've never had a wife.  Had the thing that hangs below your belt and bumps into your sack.  Well, it seems last night you caught me spanking it. 
[02:43:00]  No use denying it.  Well, I was really cranking it.  Dry your eyes and don't be sad.  But I wouldn't use those tissues.  They've already been it.  Just because it was your bed.  It's not that rascal's in West Orange tomorrow night.  An ocean township on Friday.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Steven Lynch.  Marshall Holman, Gary Dickens, hitting line for your ass.  Take a jump and track.  The unknown nougat. 
[02:43:30]  You're so lame.  It makes me puke.  All died on the Edmund Fitzgerald.  That one we're going to play many times.  Yes.  There you go.  We've got to take a quick break.  We're running rolling.  Steven Lynch, always a pleasure.  Thank you, guys.  He's hanging.  We'll play a little bit of What Did We Learn?  Yes.  And that'll be it, I guess, for today, right?  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine steak. 
[02:44:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Theater.  Theater of the Mindless.  How you guys doing?  Hey, you guys doing?  You guys doing?  My dad.  My dad.  It's time to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes.  I learned that Steven Lynch will be at Rascals in West Orange tomorrow night.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  And somewhere else the day after. 
[02:44:30]  Ocean Township.  Ocean Township.  Friday night.  Al Mack from Clifton.  Today, I learned Town Hall still isn't sold out.  Oh, God.  Just buy the tickets already.  You know it's going to be a good show, and that means less plugging by the boys.  You're doing a Town Hall?  Yeah, it's close, but not there yet.  Great venue.  Ah, let's see.  I guess we should go to the phones today, because they have a lot of good live ones.  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  Jake, what did you learn today? 
[02:45:00]  Although the balling song sucked, it's the only song you can legitimately sing about ball  sex action.  Oh, and they rule!  There you go.  He had a punch out with some strength there.  He knew it wasn't going anywhere, so he tried to save his own little...  Gary, what's up?  I learned that why bowling for dollars went off the air.  Oh, my God.  David rules. 
[02:45:30]  Look, I'm just plunking him down, Stephen.  Hey, you know what?  Kingpin, funny movie.  Oh, there you go.  The Big Lebowski.  The Big Lebowski.  Why wasn't his name incorporated into the show?  That would have been...  I wrote it decades before that came out.  Ah, Vito.  Oh, hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, special Ed still there?  Oh, Lynch?  Lynch is here, yeah.  Yeah.  He's there.  Hey, Lynch, you know a good way you cut about...  It's six minutes out of your show.  Later, boys.  I'm just... 
[02:46:00]  Wait, I didn't get an answer.  Well.  Oh, the bowling song.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I got two things.  First, the first thing is Martha's husband doesn't know how to spell bullet.  Right.  And the second thing is I'm going to go see what my mom's bunt tastes like.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, he was close.  Very, very.  I think he meant bunt cake.  We just couldn't hear cake.  Yeah.  That was a little close.  He said his mom's bunt cake.  Steve, what's going on?  Steve. 
[02:46:30]  Steve.  I learned that Joey Paisan is not from Tel Aviv.  Seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven.  All right.  Very good.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I learned a couple of things.  Yeah?  I learned that Nelson Burden has a bad wrist.  And I also learned, well, the New York audience learned, how important that little extra is on those live reads. 
[02:47:00]  What do you mean?  Well, the VIP thing.  The VIP spot.  Oh, there you go.  Bye-bye.  All right, bye.  Butters from Framingham, Mass.  Said he learned it's the time of the show where Ben goes crazy.  Oh, you see how many times he's looked up at the clock right now?  He's crazy, though.  This is the part of the show.  Because he has to time everything out.  He goes crazy.  We might have to put the camera on Ben, have Steve film him, because this is the best part of the show.  Oh, where he starts looking at the clock going, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  I'm crazy. 
[02:47:30]  Bang, bang.  And everyone can feel it in the room.  Ben's like, and he starts pacing.  Ben's looking.  Look at the paper.  He hands out to everybody.  Look at him.  Out at.  He's got the out at time.  6.50.  And we know this is not the real time that we can go a little later.  We can screw with it a little.  Ben's like, no, that's the real time.  No, that's the real time.  They know Ben is starting to go, all right, maybe I'll just say this.  I'll push it back a little.  Look at him.  So now we know he's got, like, 30 seconds more, right, Ben?  Go on to your tricks.  And we also know you guys F with that clock. 
[02:48:00]  Ben, do you jab us 30 seconds a day now?  Yes, he does.  Always.  I have to, because he won't.  That's just for that.  We're going to 6.51.  6.51.  I don't know what time it is.  Ben, do you chew us down 30 seconds?  Did I hear chew?  I love to see people squirm it.  And I know that when he writes this down, if I go to, like, a minute past, it drives him nuts.  Oh, I know.  And it just makes me very happy inside. 
[02:48:30]  He's got everything timed out.  But look at that clock.  That clock's retarded.  You use these digital clocks.  No, I know, but they thought they could trick us by fixing that clock.  Oh, that was Pete's trick.  That was Pete's trick.  Ben, how long did it take you before you started chopping time off of our out time on the paper you give us?  Probably a week into syndication.  What a dastardly trick.  All right.  Keith from Jersey learned a lot.  He learned candy as a trooper.  Hunter, fear, stalker, patty.  Yes.  After the Osbournes MTV, we'll have the Sheens and the Richards. 
[02:49:00]  And he learned something about parenting, Anthony.  You can't wander around on lithium and drink Diet Cokes.  No.  Sheep lover, I learned today, Polish purple is green.  Always funny.  Paul from Center Reach learned that WrestleMania is prevented by sour Skittles.  Bastard.  F.  Let's go to Michael.  Michael, what did you learn today?  Michael?  Michael.  Yeah, hi.  I learned that Mel Karmazin is Dean Warmer. 
[02:49:30]  They walked into our office.  Clang, clang, clang, clang.  The bottles all went away.  That was very good.  Chris, what's up?  How you guys doing?  All right.  How you doing?  I learned about bowling.  Hey, yeah, that's it.  We all learned a lot about bowling today.  A little too much about bowling.  Okay.  Norton rules.  Thank you, sir.  All right, let's go to Jim.  Jim, what did you learn today?  Hey, I learned that Triple H can only spank us in character.  Long live hollow ground.  In character like Mr. Amos uses. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Ben.  Look at him.  Glancing.  All right.  We have to be out in 30 seconds, right?  30 seconds, which you know means like a minute and a half.  No, not that much.  Yeah.  Look at him.  Kevin from D.C. learned something, Anthony.  Yeah.  The phrase, we don't want to burn you out, is code for get the F off the radio.  My bad.  My bad.  These listeners are hilarious.  My bad.  Fuck it. 
[02:50:30]  You stupid faggot.  Lynch, we don't want to.  And how you say.  We don't want to burn me out.  Thanks, Sophia.  I appreciate it.  I'll remember that next week at Governors in Levittown.  Right.  Gotham in Manhattan.  Call for showtime.  All right.  Don't forget the job tonight, 9.30.  Oh, it's now time to leave the job.  Look at that.  We're 10 seconds over.  Ben's little time.  He drew on the paper.  Creed from Island Park.  He learned the facts of life.  He's the inspiration for Lynch's songs.  Look, he starts effort with the board. 
[02:51:00]  He's like fading things off.  He's all ready to go.  Look at him freaking out.  Let's see what else we want to read.  God, we got to tape this.  We got to videotape him.  Awkward silence from mass learned.  For some reason, Canadians get American shows such as The Job before Americans do.  So, what else do we want to read here?  Oh, what about this one?  Let's see.  It's not going to work today, Jim.  Struth from Boston.  I learned today, Rerun did a movie after What's Happening.  Nice.  And strippers in New York City now seem to have some morals after 9-11.  He threw his hands up. 
[02:51:30]  He threw his hands up.  And now he's going.  That's it.  Whatever, Ben.  Now he's saying, I don't care.  I don't care.  We know we're getting to him.  No, go ahead.  Keep going.  Do whatever you want.  It's your show.  It's your show.  No, no.  Now he's punching out of the program.  Now he's making us feel guilty.  All right.  We do have to go.  All right.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you. </pre>
