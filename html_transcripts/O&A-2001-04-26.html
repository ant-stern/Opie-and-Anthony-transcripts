<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, largely revolving around a whipped cream bikini contest and the hosts’ often vulgar and offensive commentary.  The show began with a discussion of Scott Herman's successful morning show, contrasted with Opie and Anthony's own more outrageous history, followed by a news story about a rape victim who cleverly retrieved her phone from her rapist. This led into listener calls about the whipped cream bikini contest, with various opinions expressed on the contestants and their appearances.  One caller, Sal, favored “all-natural” contestants, while another, Nick, noted a resemblance between a contestant and the show's recurring character, Stinky.  Ron recounted live news segments and past stunts.  A Jerky Boy-style attempt by a caller, Jack, was abruptly cut short.  Steve shared an anecdote about using a car horn to attract women.  The hosts then criticized Gold Bond commercials before a call from Tiki Barber discussed his post-football career and recent eye surgery, briefly mentioning a documentary about his first Super Bowl.

The show then promoted a CBS News segment for a Survivor contest, offering a trip to Los Angeles as a prize. This was followed by several calls, notably from Rich Voss, characterized by crude and offensive jokes.  Another call came from Patty, a frequent caller who brought a birthday gift for Anthony, sparking discussion of her possible participation in the whipped cream bikini contest. The discussion shifted to Stephanie McMahon and the WWF Backlash event, with details on matches and behind-the-scenes information, interspersed with crude humor and sexual innuendo. This included a lengthy interview with Stephanie McMahon.

Anthony's birthday provided a significant focus, beginning with the hosts’ distaste for traditional birthday singing, escalating to a humorous, vulgar account of a chaotic birthday celebration involving a dog's diarrhea. This transitioned to a discussion of awkward birthday rituals, again punctuated with crude jokes.  The whipped cream bikini contest was heavily featured, with two women, Dallas and her friend, appearing in-studio. Dallas participated nude, with Rick applying the whipped cream.  "Stalker Patty" and Jesse, previously involved in a "voyeur bus incident," also participated, leading to graphic descriptions and vulgar commentary from the hosts on their bodies and poses.  Calls from listeners continued, including one about a boyfriend upset over his girlfriend revealing personal information on the show.  Jim Brewer called in, discussing improved vision after a procedure. The hosts promoted their Caroline's Comedy Club performance. A listener won the Survivor trip.  The segment concluded with continued explicit discussion of the contest and its contestants.

Further segments focused heavily on the whipped cream bikini contest pictures from WNEW.com, displaying and commenting on the contestants (Dallas, Jesse, and Patty).  The hosts’ treatment of Patty prompted a call from Anna, expressing discomfort, to which Opie and Anthony responded that Patty was aware of their show's style.  Numerous commercials for Pinnacle horny goat weed ran, with detailed descriptions of its purported effects.  Tim Brewer, a co-host absent from the studio during the photo display, was mocked for missing it.  The show heavily promoted their Caroline's Comedy Club appearance, mentioning other performers like Rich Voss and Jim Brewer ("Gorilla Boy").  Many calls reacted to the contest photos, offering opinions on the contestants.  The broadcast concluded with continued promotion of the contest and WNEW programming.

Throughout the entire broadcast, numerous guests were mentioned or appeared, including Rodney Dangerfield (mentioned), Stephanie McMahon (interview), Tiki Barber (phone call), Jeff Norris (mentioned), Jim Brewer (multiple appearances/mentions), and Rich Voss (multiple calls).  The show frequently discussed a Hofstra University student using show footage for a class project, Arnold Schwarzenegger's alleged affair, and speculation about the show's future time slot, alongside their planned appearance at Yankee Stadium and an uninvited, intoxicated visit to "Psycho Mark's" apartment, resulting in a confrontation in his underwear.  The entire broadcast was permeated with vulgar and offensive language and sexual innuendo.

Hey, this is Jim Brewer and I've been up since twice.  Oh, I don't know, yesterday.  And the only thing that gets you going, Hammer, is open at me.  I'm talking 1027.  N. E. W. Hammer. 
[00:00:30]  Is that Jim?  Yeah, geez.  Is that Jim or Jay?  Sometimes I can't tell the difference.  I'm talking 1027.  I love the Brewer.  How are you?  I think Jim's coming in today.  I hope so.  I haven't seen him in a while.  He's going to try to fit us into his busy schedule, Andrew.  Yes.  He's editing movies.  He's auditioning for this and that.  And most importantly, he's playing Caroline's tonight. 
[00:01:00]  Tonight.  And tickets still available for tonight's show at Caroline's.  You're insane if you don't go see Jim Brewer at Caroline's.  Yeah.  He hasn't played a smaller place in a while.  Yeah.  He's been playing the big room, the big game.  And now he's back at Caroline's.  This is a great room.  We all know that.  We have a lot of fun when we go.  So call Caroline to get your tickets.  They're going to go fast, I'm sure.  A bunch of us will be down to check out Jim Brewer tonight.  At Caroline's. 
[00:01:30]  Got to go to the phones real fast here because we noticed this as well.  Chuck.  Hello.  What's up, Chuck?  To me, there's a mirror of some dummy on a windy day trying to type wow in the sky.  Yeah, we can't figure out what's going on.  We were looking outside our office window and it looks like, I don't know.  We really couldn't tell.  It looked like it could have been a W.  It looked like it could have been a fat girl with big boobs.  Yep.  But something's going on in the sky.  I think it was a wow, but then it turned into, yeah, boobs.  Like he was trying to sky write boobs. 
[00:02:00]  I think it's Paul.  Do you think it's Paul the pilot, good friend of the show, pilot?  Yeah.  Whatever he's doing, he's not even typing on the same line.  He's got his O, W.  Typing.  Is that typing in the sky?  Typing in the sky.  Yeah.  What else are you going to call it?  I think it's called sky writing.  I've never heard this guy typing.  Well, I just want to let you guys know you guys are doing a great job.  I can't stop listening to you.  Hey, thanks.  If it looks like anything in the sky, please let us know, okay? 
[00:02:30]  Hey, I see a naked lady in the sky.  I mean, she's got big boosies.  Yeah, that's what we thought.  We weren't really sure.  Cool, man.  Thank you.  Thanks, Chuck.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We're off and running.  Tool, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, buddy?  Hey.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, I go to Hofstra University.  I walked into class today, and we were doing our video projects, and Kid had the footage  of him in the studio yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, what is it?  A Hofstra video project or something? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, it's like a video class.  Yeah.  And I was sitting in my car yesterday listening all day, wishing I could be in the studio.  Comes in with the footage today.  I nearly wet myself.  Yeah, I guess Kimmy brought this guy in for his school project, and he got some great footage.  Yeah.  He's got fun.  Here's the question.  Did he see her naked?  We all saw her naked yesterday.  Get out of here.  Some saw her more naked than others.  Oh.  Yeah.  She looks hot as hell.  You should tell your friend from Hofstra that Extra might be interested in that footage 
[00:03:30]  he has.  Really?  Because they've been calling us like crazy today.  Yeah.  Really?  Looks like Kimmy in her whipped cream bikini is going to be on Extra tonight.  Ooh.  He looks very, very nice.  What happened there, Rick?  The Star Magazine also wants the pictures.  Did they call?  Everyone's calling.  They are hot.  You can see them on the WANEW website.  I went on last night.  I couldn't see any. 
[00:04:00]  Well, it's kind of hard to get, especially when we announce it, so you're going to have  a problem now.  But, yeah, the whipped cream bikini contest, it's on, too, ladies.  So come on down today.  We'll extend it to when?  When do you think?  We're probably going to have to get another week of qualifying in.  Yeah.  But we had some lovely ladies yesterday.  Because we started off slow, but it's starting to get really, really good.  The ladies yesterday were fine.  And, of course, Kimmy also participated.  And she got completely naked, put whipped cream on her boobs and her most intimates, and 
[00:04:30]  laid down on the floor.  And the pictures are really hot.  I mean, these are like, it's so funny because the thing, papers like The Post, and  The Star, and TV shows like Access Hollywood and whatnot, they love when they could get  a picture of a celebrity in various states of just dress.  Now, Kimmy's a celebrity, yeah?  I would say so.  Well, she's on one of the hottest shows.  Sure.  Yeah.  And, I mean, they're looking for pictures of people from Survivor. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  I don't mean it like that, Rick.  I mean, she's like a friend now, so I don't really consider her, I just consider her a  friend.  People love pictures like this.  And there's Kimmy laying down.  And, you know, her, her, the vitals are covered.  Barely.  But you still see, like, it's hot because you can see the hips and everything and her belly  and the legs.  And she's just out there, laying out there.  When she said, are you guys ready?  And then walked out of the bathroom, basically nude.  Oh, my.  Yeah.  It's just ridiculous.  And then she laid there for a while, and then we started squirting the whipped cream 
[00:05:30]  with squirt guns.  Right.  Trying to wash the whipped cream off, and she's freaked.  She's just grabbing her crotch and her poof and running, running bare-ass into the bathroom.  We just all saw her ass.  Now, who has very valuable video is Steve from FoundryMusic.com.  Yes.  Very valuable.  We reamed it.  You reamed it.  I reamed it.  No, I don't think we ruined it with the water gun.  No, she was getting ready to get up.  Yeah.  I could see.  And then she had to get up now, and everything was falling off her.  It was great.  I didn't know I was shooting her. 
[00:06:00]  I thought it was a VC.  But I was shooting Innocent Kimmy.  There wasn't a moon out.  It was dark.  We'll get into that a little later.  I opened fire.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  Yesterday's show was Instant Best Of.  One of the best you guys ever did.  Just absolutely phenomenal.  Yeah, I think we could just rerun that as a show when we're off.  Not a problem.  Definitely.  Not a problem at all.  Rodney Dangerfield was a lot of fun.  Oh, and he killed that.  Yeah.  I'll tell you, I never heard more laughter coming out of the studio than when he was on. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  A lot of the really good stuff got dumped because he was using the F word.  I was on hold.  I was on hold when he was using it, man.  I'll tell you, I was worried.  Are we going to replay it over the weekend?  Yeah, we'll replay it with the bleaks in for the F word this Saturday when we do our  Worst Up show, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.  Cool.  You understand between that and Jimmy and the girls with the Great Lube Debate?  That was a great show.  The Great Lube Debate.  Oh, I forgot.  The Great Lube Debate.  Balloon Not Pleasure.  Yeah.  Yep.  I forgot about that.  And all the stuff we dumped out of, I guess, is that sheet up on foundrymusic.com? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Now, go to our foundry and look at the daily dump sheet because yesterday, I thought the  day before yesterday's show was a really good dump sheet.  No.  Yesterday's was amazing.  The stuff Rodney was saying.  Rodney has like four dumps and it's all because of the F word.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rodney is coming back, I think, Tuesday.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Bowen?  Listen, I got a little bone to pick with you guys.  I love the show.  I love the stuff you guys do.  But, man, can you guys be some sea-sucking D-bags sometimes? 
[00:07:30]  Why?  I'm a huge fan of Jay Moore, Brewer, the whole crew, everyone that comes down to the show.  I love them.  Now, Moore hasn't been in doing his shameless plugs.  You know, he came in one day last week.  But these guys, they kind of like sneak into town.  And you tell me, like, the day before, I call the show Monday.  Kelly tells me, yeah, Brewer's definitely coming to town.  So I'm like, you know what?  Cool.  Let me call and get tickets.  I called yesterday.  They're like, oh, we got Thursday left.  Yeah.  I don't get off.  I don't get off. 
[00:08:00]  Work till 9.30.  I figure, hey, I can get off, go right over to Caroline's box office, pick up the tickets,  and I should have no problem because no one seems interested.  Thursday night show.  What's the first thing you mother effers do when you get on the air?  Hey, there's still tickets up for the night.  The Brewer, we didn't mention he was coming to town.  Now every a-hole that didn't go out and know about it or get their tickets, I'm going to  get left out in the cold because I'm working hard all day.  You guys kill me.  I love you guys.  Peace.  All right.  Well, tickets still available for Brewer and Caroline tonight, but not many. 
[00:08:30]  I'm just party pooper.  Steve, call back if you're still listening, and we'll get you in, all right?  We'll recognize that voice of yours without a doubt.  Without a doubt.  Obviously.  You know, he brings up a good point, though.  We've got to find somewhere on one of our websites where we can list all our regulars and where  they're going to be, you know?  Yeah.  When they come into town, instead of the night of a show announcing, it's like he was so  angry with them.  Right.  So then the hardcore ones will know, all right?  I go to foundyourmusic.com or whatever.  Oh, look.  Brian Regan.  Like, Brian Regan's playing Rascals.  He's coming in tomorrow. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, no.  Brian.  And then Sunday, he's going to be at Governor's on Long Island.  Oh, I'm going to the Governor's show.  Yeah, because Brian Regan, that's close to home.  Is that a town?  No offense to Rascals, but that's an easy ride for me at Governor's, so I'm going to  see Brian Regan Sunday at Governor's.  And I just found out this morning they added the second show for Sunday night at Governor's  for Regan.  Whole show?  Whole show.  Because you get whole show.  Not just half show on Sunday.  But see, this is new news for everybody. 
[00:09:30]  Regan's playing Governor's.  Yeah.  If we had it all nice on a website, nice.  There it is.  We love surrounding ourselves with our good comics.  Well, yeah, of course.  We've been doing that for a long time, man.  Let's go to Mike from the NYPD.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  I got a little thing I'd like to share with you.  Okay.  We were at the Yankee game with a bunch of guys, if you guys know, last night.  And we made it locked up.  The first thing he said was getting right up.  I have no idea who he is.  I couldn't believe the picture that he was on the telephone. 
[00:10:00]  Wait a minute.  Hey, Mike, I know you love the show, but you were such a dick to me last night.  Are you so into that?  I was trying to watch Boot Camp last night, and you guys were interrupting my TV viewing.  And then he's going, hey, you're cocky and, you know, full of, you know, energy on the air,  but you're pretty boring at home.  I'm like, I'm watching TV.  I'm watching TV.  He wants a bit, Sophie.  He was like, I'm going to boot camp.  I was like, I don't know him.  I don't know who he is.  These drunks were, like, harassing everyone on the phone, live at their apartment. 
[00:10:30]  We should explain this story.  Yeah, they all went to the Yankee game.  And I, we weren't invited.  Yes, you were.  No, you guys were invited.  You didn't show up.  I don't think I was invited.  I couldn't at all last night.  I left you a message on Sunday.  You never called me back.  Oh, you're right.  When you're right, you're right.  Thank you.  So these guys go, and they just get completely hammered.  Mike, I'm going to keep you on hold just for a little bit.  I'm going to pop you back on, though.  Hold on. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  Because your phone's a little weird.  So, yeah, you guys got hammered at the Yankee game.  You have no idea who won, I bet.  I didn't see half of the game.  Yeah, we got two innings from it.  You guys, man.  Two innings from the seats, the rest from the bar area.  Yeah.  These guys just went.  I don't even know why you went to the game.  You should have just went to a bar.  We pretty much did.  We actually thought about that, because traffic was pretty bad.  Bill and Max were like, oh, why don't we just go to a bar and screw the game?  Yeah, we didn't get there until, like, the third inning, and then we sat in the seat  for a half inning, and then we went to the bar. 
[00:11:30]  I can just tell you my part of it.  All of a sudden, the phone rings, and it's a cop.  And they're like, hey, we got some guy named, well, they use Mark's real name.  Yeah, in lockdown, and he says he knows you.  And I'm like, I don't know any Mark, blah, blah.  It won't sound forever in a second in a second.  And you know what?  It did sound very real.  It sounded like it was the real deal.  I'm like, I don't know, no, I don't know.  Yeah, because then all of a sudden, it turns into a whole night. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  You're watching TV.  You're busy.  I'm trying to watch boot camp.  Right.  Screw Mark.  And then all of a sudden, it's like, no, Mark.  Mark, blah, blah.  He says he knows you.  He's a friend of the show.  I don't know who he is.  I don't know.  And then he goes, no, hold on.  Then he goes, Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  He's in lockdown.  He says he knows you.  You come down here.  We'll let him out.  I'm like, don't know him.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  And as I'm doing this, you know, over and over again, you know, and the cop on the other 
[00:12:30]  end of the phone is explaining, no, Psycho Mark from the show.  It's obvious.  Stinky and Rick and Ben are here at the conversation.  They're right next to the cop.  I hear Ben laughing like he does in the studio.  Yeah.  He laughed his balls off.  Like, it was the funniest thing ever that I, you know, denied that I knew Psycho Mark.  It's about all knowledge.  Oh, yeah.  I'm trying to get him off the phone because the commercial's almost over and I want to  see who's going to get dismissed on Dismissal Hill.  It didn't end at the stadium, though, did it? 
[00:13:00]  Oh, no.  It only started.  That's when I'm beginning.  These guys ended up where?  At Psycho Mark's apartment.  Well, we left.  We left the game and we actually partied after the game in the bar for a while.  Yeah.  Then we left and then we walked by.  The players were coming out.  Let me also add quickly.  The game.  These guys were hammered by five o'clock.  We had a hell of a party here yesterday.  Yesterday afternoon.  Yes.  I went.  Thank God I didn't go to the game.  I went home and passed out.  Plus the cooler in the van that kept us nice in the traffic. 
[00:13:30]  We had a full bar in the car.  There was a one second when the beer wasn't in arm's reach.  It bottles of Captain Morgan, rum, and Cokes in the car.  Yeah, what did you say to me before you left the office?  Ben grabs my bottle of Captain Morgan.  It's already like half empty.  It just goes, I'll get you this back.  And he just like leaves.  Like, I'm taking this, but I'll pay you back, don't worry.  I'm like, take it.  Have fun.  We're walking to Billy Mac's car and Ben disappears.  He comes running up to the car with a two liter thing of Coke.  You need the Coke with the Captain. 
[00:14:00]  What's wrong with the Coke?  See, it all started with when Mark left.  When we left the building, Mark's trying to work Kimmy on the way out.  He's like, yeah, yeah.  So that's when that all started.  Rick was harassing.  Rick called him at least 30 times.  Like, ah, I got this by Kimmy on the way to the game.  Because he's walking away from us.  We're walking one direction.  Him and Kimmy are walking another.  And he just hears him.  He goes, so you got any plans for dinner?  I know somebody in Hooters. 
[00:14:30]  He's just laying it on, doing his psycho Mark stuff.  He's trying to work his way in.  And she blows him off, like instantly.  So then he's like, ah, you know, she had all the plans, she said.  Yeah, plans that didn't involve him.  That's funny.  I got to hear, though, what happened when you got to his apartment.  Yeah, this is the grand finale.  What time did you decide to harass Psycho Mark at his place of residence?  12.  12.30?  Something like that.  12.30.  After about 40, 50 phone calls to him saying how gay he was. 
[00:15:00]  And how he would just pick up.  And he'd be like, ah, if you hang up right away.  He didn't even say anything.  Before he could get the second gag out.  So we warned him we're coming to his apartment.  He's like, yeah, whatever, guys.  So we head down there.  We just run past the doorman.  We're like, yeah, Mark Walsh.  So we just run quickly so he can't stop us.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  That's okay.  That's right.  People know it.  And we go running right by.  And the doorman, I'm like, you know, I say the number.  And he's like, wait. 
[00:15:30]  I'm just like, come on, guys.  It's like, gee, Mark actually lives in a nice building.  Oh, it's a really nice building.  Doorman.  He's got the little hat and the jacket on.  The whole thing.  Right?  So we get into the elevator.  We get all the way to 43rd floor.  The drug trade is good.  Yeah.  Because he knows where he's going.  And he goes around this corner.  All of a sudden, you hear a door slam and go, you guys are coming.  He's in his underwear.  He's in his underwear.  So now Ben starts knocking on his door. 
[00:16:00]  That prompts Mark.  He opens up his door like a psychotic freaking lunatic.  Jumps out in his underwear looking like Fred Flintstone wanting to have a fight.  Bouncing around, taking a swing at Ben.  He was punching at you.  No, he's going to swing at me.  I've got to work at double tomorrow.  I'm going to do it like a double.  And then I've got to go to the goddamn DMV and talk to myself.  And then I've got to go to the library and return some books.  He was coming up with every interview.  Under the sun. 
[00:16:30]  So you guys didn't get in his apartment?  No.  We couldn't see the naked boy that was running around.  Peering for his life.  Psycho Mark.  I'm so pissed, you faggot.  You guys are so goddamn drunk.  You guys are idiots.  Wah, wah, wah.  Hey, Rick, you followed it.  Hey, you followed it with Kimmy, by the way.  I never asked her.  You didn't hear a word.  I said it.  We all heard it, dude.  Whatever.  I didn't ask her out.  Hey, I didn't strike now.  Don't like the next guy.  I was just like, hey, want to go some more? 
[00:17:00]  Can we eat?  Dude, Ben, all right, check this out.  You guys call me 10,000 times in the game.  You know, he's lost, so go ask yourself.  But all I hear is Ben cackling in the background.  We're going to go to the house.  I've got to jump in here, because Mark, it brings up a really good...  When Ben calls you wasted, it's one of the funniest things ever.  He just cackles the whole time.  He thinks it's the funniest thing that he's calling you at 11 o'clock at night on a Tuesday.  Dude, he turned...  He turns into a werewolf, and he starts screaming. 
[00:17:30]  He really does, Ben.  He turns into a friggin' maniac.  He gets 10 times worse than I could ever be.  Oh, no, I don't know, Mike.  No, he doesn't.  Hold on.  No, I was fine last night.  No, I didn't do wrong last night.  Hold on, you know.  You know, I love abusing Psycho Mark like anyone, but I saw it with my own eyes.  Psycho Mark, me, and Ben.  That was it that night, having dinner.  And Ben was getting hammered and was embarrassing Psycho Mark to the point.  He's like, Ben, shut up.  He'll out, man. 
[00:18:00]  Cut it out.  And Ben is just trying to get at Psycho Mark, trying to get him.  Remember that, Opie?  Oh, yeah.  He's in the restaurant screaming, you're crazy.  There's 30 people sitting around us.  He's screaming, you're crazy.  Yeah, and then you smash the keyboard.  Right.  So after that whole thing, when you finally went outside of the restaurant, who took a computer  keyboard and smashed it on a signpost or something, he had me all teed up.  But it was funny, because Mark was getting embarrassed in the restaurant, because Ben gets  really loud and starts calling people faggots to their face when he gets drunk. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  So he calls me last night.  He goes, we're coming over.  I go, oh, no, you're not.  I'm working a double.  Oh, you're not.  I'm working a double.  So I call my doorman downstairs.  I say, if four drunk guys come through the lobby and try and get upstairs, don't let  them in.  That works.  No kidding.  Sure enough, I hear the doorman calls me up.  He goes, four guys just ran off.  They're out of the way right now.  They're really drunk and rude.  So I'm going, Christ, I'm ready to grab my paintball gun. 
[00:19:00]  You guys don't know how close you were.  Mark, hold on, Mark.  I just got to bring up an observation.  You knew they were coming.  You had enough time to put your pants on.  No, no, no.  Screw that.  I was hoping to get a quickie from Rick.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, nice.  All right, so what happened, Mark?  All I hear is just you hear the door open from the elevator and just it sounded like four  schoolgirls running down the hall giggling. 
[00:19:30]  I know that's true.  I'm so angry.  And I really almost punched all of them.  I was so mad.  I mean, can you imagine if they showed up at your house at 1230, drunk out of their minds,  giggling?  I was lucky.  I only got the phone call, thank God.  It was just brutal.  That's funny.  Ben, you guys have to go to a frigging A.A. meeting.  Yeah, coming from you.  Well, thanks for the torture, you faggot. 
[00:20:00]  Go, Sean, you bunch of faggot.  All right, Mark.  Go have Sean Hannity pick up your phone again.  He's claiming that Sean Hannity's answering his phone when we're calling him.  He goes, well, guys, stop it, because Sean Hannity's answering my phone now.  I'm sorry.  He's so full of crap.  Hello, Psycho Mark's desk.  That's what he's saying.  I'm like, Mark, it's obviously...  No, it's not.  Hey, Mike.  We lost the cop.  All right.  I'd like you guys to have a fun time at the Yankee game. 
[00:20:30]  Doug, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Let me get this straight.  Four guys go to Psycho Mark's apartment.  He lives with a gay guy.  He runs out of the apartment in his underwear in a panic-stricken mood, and he won't let his  friends in.  Spaggots.  Hey, Mark.  Psycho Mark.  We kind of hinted at that in the back office.  I'm glad someone else brought it up on here.  He had the safety syrup on his chin, too.  There, you guys.  All right, Doug.  It was amazing that we didn't see the knee pads that he had on. 
[00:21:00]  You guys are out of control.  Well, you know what?  Mark would do this to anybody else in a heartbeat.  He would go out of his way.  And as soon as you do it to him, I have to work a double.  Then I've got to do laundry.  Then I've got to get my nails done.  You guys.  Doug, I want a shot here at the last night in the fall with you.  Yeah, okay.  Whatever.  You want to call back tonight?  I'll put him on, you stupid corner.  You got me. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, thanks for working with the competition, Mark.  We appreciate it.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Yeah, and giving him a plug.  Nice.  Yeah, thanks.  I'll give him another plug.  All right, bye.  I'm from Hoboken checking in.  What does Mark care?  They got him air time.  There you go.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Hey, man.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  I'm a travel nurse.  Just moved to the area this week, and I picked you guys up Tuesday.  So I checked you out pretty much all day, and then I listened yesterday for sure. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  I want to know what the hell you guys are going to do today to beat the last two shows.  Yeah, I know.  I'll take the wrong damn time to start listening.  You guys are going to let me down.  I'm going to be jonesing over here in Chatham.  We're already doing it.  I think the last 20 minutes was pretty damn funny.  Yeah, it's pretty funny.  But, you know, I mean, unless you got Rodney Dangerfield, Balloon Knot, and Kimmy, while  two girls bitch about lubing the balloon knots, I don't know what you're going to do without  it.  This is what we're going to do today.  We're going to have more girls come down for the whipped cream bikini contest.  Yep.  Great.  Hey, and you got to go with Sylvia, by the way.  I like Kimmy, but you got to go with Sylvia.  She's awesome. 
[00:22:30]  I would say she's close to the lead right now, but just, I'll be there all finalists.  Yeah, it's too early to tell, though, because ladies can still come down and qualify today  and tomorrow and next week.  Excuse me.  Cool, man.  And I'm going to try to check out Brewer.  I'm going to really piss that guy off that was bitching at you about letting people know.  All right, Joe.  I got to go.  All right, man.  Hey, you guys take care, man.  It's great listening to you guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Thank you, man.  So we got, yeah, the girls coming down, grand prize trip to Hawaii.  Ladies, don't forget about that.  Just come on down.  Show us what you got.  Put some whipped cream on you.  Take some pictures, Brewer, on the internet. 
[00:23:00]  Very easy, easy contest.  We got Stephanie McMahon checking in today.  Tiki Barber calling in.  Jim Brewer stopping by.  Stinky will get fisted.  Yes!  Sylvia looks good.  Sylvia looks great.  I don't like the implants.  Well, I mean, it's hot.  It's good.  What?  May you shut up?  Let me see.  Turn around.  I don't like the implants.  It's not an implant guy there. 
[00:23:30]  Let me see.  No, this one.  Couldn't have been like Stinky Sister.  Stinky Sister.  Enter the contest.  I know that's a visual, but that looks like you had long hair.  It's naked Stinky.  That guy's embarrassing me.  Someone's got to do a split screen now.  Get a picture of Stinky and that girl.  No, because that's funny.  That's Nyroka.  So people can play along at home.  All right.  Put his head on.  Look.  See? 
[00:24:00]  I like her.  Fine and well.  I like her.  But I mean, implants.  All right.  We seem to like the regular girls on this show.  And the Best Boob competition.  Remember, implants were eliminated very quickly.  Yes.  It's early, though.  More girls coming down today, I'm sure.  All right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Rick's writing some real fast.  Did anyone see CBS News this morning between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m.? 
[00:24:30]  Opie and Anthony were on TV giving a video clue for your chance to win a trip to L.A.  L.A. for the final show of Survivor.  Okay.  Oh.  We're going to ask a trivia question at 6.30 today.  Is that what we're doing?  Okay.  Good.  It's Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  Ladies, come down to WNEW anytime between 3 and 7 for your chance to win the grand prize  trip to Hawaii.  It's your body covered in our cream. 
[00:25:00]  Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  1-0-2-7-WNEW.  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  It was very good to see Joey yesterday.  I want to thank Joey for driving me home last night.  Saved me a ride on the Long Island Railroad.  I love when that happens.  Joey drove you home?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  How'd it go?  Good.  He rocks.  He went way out of his way to drive me home.  He did.  I felt guilty the whole time. 
[00:25:30]  That's cool.  Now, you know, someday maybe he will ask you for a favor.  I'm doing a favor right now.  Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Yes, Romance of Italy.  A warm, friendly, relaxed restaurant.  And the authentic Italian cuisine.  It's incredible.  It's made from old world Italian recipes.  And the price is very, very reasonable.  You take the whole family there and you're not going to go broke.  The portions are huge, too.  So you'll take home the dogy bag.  Incredible pasta lunch specials so it's not just for dinner. 
[00:26:00]  Ask for Joey, the owner, and you get a glass of wine in the house.  And speaking of wine, Paisano has a great wine list.  Paisano of Mulberry Street right in the heart of Little Italy.  136 Mulberry.  Call them up.  965-1188.  965-1188.  They're open seven days a week.  Weekend still two.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  What country are you from?  Uh, what?  What?  What ain't no country I haven't heard of.  And listen, what?  Uh, what?  What?  Angry, mother f***er, do you speak it?  Yeah.  Then you know what I'm saying.  Uh, what?  Say what again.  Say what again. 
[00:26:30]  I dare you.  I don't dare you, mother f***er.  Say what one more f***er.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Destroy, destroy.  What month?  Opie and Anthony, one of two seven, WNEW.  This is how we go about it, to make our heads and floor a night.  This is how we go about it, to make our heads and floor a night. 
[00:27:00]  I got all the combinations, you know, don't you know I'm always lying.  This is how we go about it, to make our heads and floor a night.  That's the latest from Monster Magnus.  Heads explode.  One oh two seven, WNEW.  Nice.  See, you can get the best parts of the tune.  You don't have to listen to an entire song.  You're going to get parts that you don't like.  What do we call a chip off the old rock block? 
[00:27:30]  That's all you need.  A little chip.  Just need a chip.  That's it.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Our first contestant for the whipped cream bikini contest for today, anyway.  Yeah.  Has arrived, I believe.  Ladies show up.  A trip to Hawaii on the line.  Yes.  And the competition getting a little tougher as the week goes on.  Hoping a lot of ladies show up today and tomorrow, especially. 
[00:28:00]  So am I.  How are you?  We're going to extend it until next week.  Forget that.  Now we're having fun.  Yeah, it's on.  Forget it.  Don't forget it.  Whatever I was going to say.  Rick's spitting something out.  Because, you know, any story in the paper or on the news about Arnold Schwarzenegger,  I just start jiggling too and laughing like a little schoolgirl because of all the damn  Arnold clips we got.  I just start doing things.  Like, I hear, in the news, Arnold Schwarzenegger, I start going, how are you? 
[00:28:30]  Hello.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  I sit down on the couch like a blithering idiot.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  Who's the girl?  Well, there's a story coming out that, yes, indeed, Arnold has been having an affair.  You son of a bitch.  No, Arnold.  Don't blame the messenger.  I'm just saying.  Sounds like there's a problem in the marriage.  No problemo.  No problem at all.  There's a big problem.  The first time they had sex was when the girl was 16 years old.  Yes, I like them young. 
[00:29:00]  Well, now she's like 42, I think.  Your clothes, give them to me.  Now.  It was child actress, Gigi Goyette.  Who?  Someone's got to help us out and tell us what she played.  Hold on.  Child actress, Gigi Goyette.  I've got it right now.  G-O-Y-E-T-T-E.  G-O-Y-E-T-T-E.  That's her last name?  Yeah.  I'll go to a call as you look that up. 
[00:29:30]  Tom?  Hey, guys.  What's her first name?  Yeah.  Gigi.  Gigi?  Yeah.  Tom, go ahead.  Yeah, I've got just a couple quick things.  One, who's the new girl answering the phone?  She sounds hot.  Ah, that's the lovely Kelly.  Oh, okay.  And two, on these new girls, Anthony just doesn't like the one with the fake boobs because she's  over 14.  And the other one, how did you get that one brought in there?  I thought the manatee was an endangered species.  Oh, Mendy.  Big butt Mendy.  Holy smokes. 
[00:30:00]  She's as big as my apartment.  Yeah, there's a pretty disturbing picture of Mendy.  That just ain't right, man.  Usually when you lay a girl down on her back, she looks pretty cool.  Man, I mean, there is fat just spilling over the sides of her.  She looks like a manatee, dude.  Yeah, she's cool, though.  Yeah, whatever.  Later, guys.  All right, man.  She's a sweetheart.  She does a lot of cool stuff for us.  I can't find her.  Her body is horrendous.  Oh, she's a cool girl.  Tony.  What up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Al.  Even though the mutts are getting killed, good highlight reel for you.  Ordone has lined a shot right off the pitch's face, blood spewing all over the place. 
[00:30:30]  You know, Tony, during commercials, we saw it.  Yeah, the Mets are getting killed.  Did they have to show that clip ten times in a row from every angle?  Yeah, they suck, you know.  It was a nice shot, though.  I'm glad they showed it.  That was a great shot.  Shot up the middle and split his nose right in half.  Hitting up tickets.  Yeah, he was bleeding like crazy.  Anyway, dudes, home run so far, past couple of days.  Thank you.  Not to be cruel, but, dude, Mendy looks like a rhinoceros with a marshmallow fluff all over her. 
[00:31:00]  Dude, Kelly, whole.  Yeah.  One more thing, I'm out.  I feel bad for Florentine.  I wonder if Norton's blind today.  This house looks like a marshmallow factory meltdown.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, because Norton had to go home and relieve him.  First time of my life I wanted to live vicariously through somebody else's junk.  Yeah, he told the complete story after we got off the air.  Rock on, brothers.  He was inches away from ground zero and totally exposed to ground zero.  Yeah.  And he had his hand with one ply of paper towel moistened over his hand. 
[00:31:30]  That was it.  And he's rubbing where his finger was brushing hubba bubba.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we bow to Kimmy from Survivor today.  Oh, my God.  He's going to get us some more national exposure because everyone's calling for the whipped cream bikini pictures of Kimmy that are on WNW.com.  They're on FoundryMusic.com.  They're on OpieAnthony.com.  And pretty much another hundred websites because everyone's taking the pictures and putting them on their own website. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  And Star Magazine has called.  Extra.  A couple of the local paper.  It's ridiculous.  But I guess we got the okay.  And Extra is going to be running the shots possibly tonight.  Well, they want to.  They want to run them right away, right?  Yeah.  So if someone's near a TV later, let us know if Extra does anything with that.  Now, back to Arnold.  Yeah.  She was 16 at the time of this affair.  Right.  And how long ago was it?  Well, she's in her early 40s now. 
[00:32:30]  I guess they had sex.  In the 70s or something.  Yeah.  They had sex when she was 16.  And then she left the area for a very long time.  And then she came back, I guess.  And they had an affair.  Oh, man.  But he was married to her back then?  No.  Oh, they had a seven-year affair.  They had a seven-year affair recently.  Right.  But the first time they had the sex was when this girl was 16.  Oh.  Meeting at a Malibu restaurant when she was 16.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Well, I don't know.  That Maria is not holding up too well.  You don't like to pray in Mantis?  It's like a viper.  She could unhinge the jaw.  Hmm.  And that's why they're saying he's not running for office.  Because the Inquirer is going to blur these stories out.  Man, it's so funny when you know it's absolutely true, too.  Because the Inquirer or the Star prints something.  And they're like, oh, my God.  We are so outraged at these allegations. 
[00:33:30]  But they don't sue.  And they start changing what they had planned.  Like, Arnold planned on running for office.  You know how many skeletons come flying out of closets when you run for office?  You can't have done anything.  Well, it's no surprise.  No.  They've been saying this for years with Arnold.  I'm the party pooper.  Yes, you are.  Now we're having fun.  Well, you've had a lot of fun.  Hello, cutie pie.  He's in the restaurant.  Yes, he did.  And then after some sex and some sleep.  Good morning.  Good morning. 
[00:34:00]  Nick, what's up?  Hey, Hope.  I was wondering if you think that name is Gigi or Gigi.  Gigi.  The president of Geneseo just jumped off a roof, I think.  Why?  Gigi.  I said Gigi.  You said Gigi, dude.  Go back and listen to the tape.  Did I?  All right.  Anyway, I'm just kidding.  Hey, syndication when you guys are broadcasting multiple markets.  Oh, fun you would say that.  Syndication when we're syndicated.  That's pretty much what he just said. 
[00:34:30]  Very funny.  Funny you would say that, though.  I thought Kennedy women were used to being cheated on.  At least Arnold didn't drown anyone.  Very funny, Juan.  It's true.  You have to drown the whore.  Drive her into a river.  Cheryl.  Hey.  Hello.  Hey.  Hi.  What's up?  Am I on the air?  Yeah.  Yes.  Listen, I've been waiting forever.  I have to tell you, my friend Nyonka is in your contest. 
[00:35:00]  Her name's not Nyroka.  It's Nyoka.  Nyoka.  N-Y-O-K-A.  And I think she's beautiful, and she'll outbeat all the girls.  There you go.  And you want...  She's beautiful because her boobs are real.  No, we like her.  You want to know how to vote?  Vote online, or can I vote with you guys?  Online when...  Online.  Just keep listening to the show.  We'll let you know.  It's going to be a while before the voting starts, okay?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  So I keep listening?  Yes.  Okay.  And remember, Nyoka's beautiful, okay?  That would be a good thing.  Thank you.  Can you correct her name on the website? 
[00:35:30]  Yes.  N-Y-O-K-A.  N-Y-O-K-A.  Yeah.  Nyoka, doesn't that sound much prettier than...  Okay.  Thank you.  That's the chick that looks like Stinky.  That's the Indian.  Yeah.  She's very good looking, yes.  Well, yeah, and go to the site, check it out.  And I'm still looking for a side-by-side of Stinky, a picture of Stinky smiling and Nyoka  smiling, because they look like they can be related.  Right.  Anthony, someone just called and they hung up. 
[00:36:00]  They want to know if we're making money off Kimmy's whipped cream bikini pictures.  No.  No, we're not.  How would we make money off of that?  Kimmy wanted in on the contest.  We took the pictures.  We put them on the website.  And then everyone just went nuts for these pictures.  They're going to run them no matter what, we say.  Yeah.  So don't take money off of them.  What do you think we're like?  Making a deal with...  Extra?  Extra and saying, hey, like the people that get the Rodney King getting beaten video and  go to, what was the show on at the time, A Current Affair, and they make money off 
[00:36:30]  of it?  Well, get Rick in here.  Maybe Rick's making money behind the scenes.  Oh.  Rick was the photographer.  That's hysterical.  Rick's picture will be seen by more people than...  A regular photographer.  Than like a photographer.  A photographer with dreams.  You know how many times we've bitched about Rick's photography and now, look, look, his  work is going to be seen by millions.  Yeah.  Where the hell is it?  And I mean millions.  Oh, yeah.  This is like big news.  Whenever you get somebody, especially from a hit show like Survivor, semi-nude, all the 
[00:37:00]  people chomping the bit to get this stuff.  Well, everyone else has let us down, Anthony.  Yeah.  You know, we assault the media.  Caleb, we like to have signs in front of live shots and stuff.  None of that's happening anymore.  We had to get Kimmy involved, and she's getting us some national exposure.  Rick, a lot of people want to know if you're going to be making money off extra showing  your shots.  Yeah.  Of Kimmy.  Uh, no.  Do they ask you?  No.  They would never ask to give money.  They wait for you to go, well, you know, it's going to cost you. 
[00:37:30]  You should ask them for money.  Just so we have like beer money later on.  Oh, but they're flying me out to.  Yeah.  Beer money.  Ask them to send, um, yeah, a six pack.  Okay.  We want a six of Bud, nothing less.  All right.  I'll do it right now.  Or a six of Sam Adams.  Ooh.  How about one of each?  Nice.  Nice is right.  We'll hold them hostage.  Rich, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I have to ask you, um, as a loyal listener for two and a half years, um, you're going 
[00:38:00]  to be doing something beginning of June when, uh, a certain, uh, contract gets up?  Like you're going to do a listener get together before then?  Preferably in New Jersey?  Hmm.  Let's think.  Like a road show?  We need a New Jersey road show.  We need a New Jersey road show.  We are, uh, we are working on things.  Next question.  Is there, um...  That was good, right, Ant?  Very good.  Are there any...  I...  Do you have any ideas about what stations you would be going to in the morning?  Like, uh...  Stations we would be going to in the morning?  Yeah.  What are you speculating here? 
[00:38:30]  Oh, like Z100 or PLJ.  Z100?  Aren't there people there?  Well, you know, something that makes you think you'd do a lot better on the...  instead of the ZZO in the morning.  Who is this?  Drudge Senior?  No, no.  No, no, no.  I just, uh, just a loyal listener who can't wait for you to take on the, uh, I can't mention.  You know what I want to do?  What?  I'm going to hang up on you, Rich, because you're going to get us all in trouble.  Thank you.  Oh, but thanks.  No, but thanks.  Everyone's speculating.  We should just, uh...  What?  We should let our listeners, uh, uh, decide our future. 
[00:39:00]  What are you...  Because I don't, I don't carry the way at this point.  Right?  We should have them decide if they'd rather hear us in mornings or afternoons.  Dead serious.  And whatever they decide, we'll do.  Oh, my God.  Let the listeners decide.  Completely, I'm serious.  We get an internet poll.  Uh-huh.  So we hold some cars now.  I think that's obvious to a lot of people. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Let's let the listeners decide.  What do they want to see happen?  Okay.  O&A in mornings or O&A in, uh, afternoons?  In afternoons.  I want to, I want, like, some kind of polling to take place.  I don't think they'll allow us to do it on WNW.com.  So maybe on, like, foundrymusic.com.  Set up a poll.  Set up a poll.  Test the waters.  Let's test the waters.  And whatever the listeners say, we'll do.  Yeah.  I am, I am totally willing.  What?  I am totally willing to, uh, to do what the listeners say. 
[00:40:00]  Do what the listeners say?  Yes.  It's a great place to leave our future.  In the hands of the listener.  Steve, uh, just, uh, gave me the, uh, international symbol for five.  What does that mean?  He put up the five.  What?  That means, uh, the poll will be up in five minutes.  Oh, right?  Why not?  That's a great way to decide, right?  Sure.  And then no one, you know, then we don't have to feel guilty.  I like it. 
[00:40:30]  Steve?  Simply, um, should ONA be on the air in mornings or in afternoons?  That's...  Where would you rather see them?  Where would you rather see ONA?  Where would, yeah.  Would you rather listen to them in mornings or afternoons?  Don't even say stations or anything.  It doesn't matter.  What would you rather...  Absolutely.  ...hear them?  Give me now 15 minutes, because since you mentioned that, I, the site's going to go  crash and I have to actually go in.  The voting is going to be lopsided.  And I'll tell you why.  Everyone that's listening to us right now is listening in the afternoon. 
[00:41:00]  And they're going to vote afternoon.  The people that would listen in the mornings might not be listening, or not as many of them  would be listening, because it's not the morning right now.  They would be our new listeners.  Yeah.  They don't even know we exist yet.  You don't have to do it on instant feedback.  But they are already.  And it's just now.  Afternoons.  Afternoons.  Afternoons.  Of course.  Click radio.  Shut up.  It's not click radio.  Rudge Jr., who said that both of us, or just me, was negotiating with Comedy World, the 
[00:41:30]  internet radio thing.  Well, it went belly up like a few days ago.  So, real good tip you got there, Rudge Jr.  Well, it happened because you didn't sign.  Yeah.  Well, of course.  They were banking on that.  Well, look, you don't want to do it then?  What?  I thought it would be a good idea.  I just think the voting will be lopsided.  Tell the people in the morning that we would go to the morning.  Oh, yeah.  Because everyone's just saying afternoon. 
[00:42:00]  Jen, what's going on?  Hey.  It has been an absolutely insane day.  Taking calls from the National Enquirer, The Globe, Star Magazine, on and on.  And it sounds like you guys have had that kind of day, too.  Oh, what?  You've been getting calls?  Whippedcreambikini.com.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Oh, you're the sponsor of the Whipped Cream Bikini contest.  Yes, I am.  I'll tell you one thing that'll piss me off to no effing end.  Just like a lot of things that happened with the Voyeur Bus story, if this story ends up, 
[00:42:30]  here's Kimmy.  She's in her whipped cream bikini doing a contest for Whippedcreambikini.com, and that's all they say?  I'm going to lose my mind.  I refer everybody to any W.  What about that whole piece on the Voyeur Bus, and I think Dateline, that didn't mention us at all?  You know, we're in radio.  You know, we like when things like this happen to get a little recognition.  It's the juice, the fuel we need.  Well, you will get it from this end.  Well, Jen, yeah, you've got to post some stuff on Whippedcreambikini.com immediately. 
[00:43:00]  And you are there.  Okay.  Now, who has called you?  Globe called me.  Nice.  Star Magazine called me.  All the good publications.  Inquiry called me.  Nice.  That's pretty much the list of them.  Okay.  Well, Extra called us.  Okay.  I think Extra is doing something tonight.  Well, you know, it works both ways.  If you guys are on Extra, Whippedcreambikini.com could get a real nice mention there.  Well, there you go.  Yes.  No, they're not sending anyone in.  They're just going to show it real fast.  Oh, that's great. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  There will be no interviews of Ant and I where I'm just nodding and Ant talks for two and a half seconds.  Well, you know, the guy kept saying to me.  Well, did anybody hear anything juicy about Kimmy in the studio?  And I'm like, put the radio on.  Jim Norton saw some juicy stuff.  Well.  Hey, we should start like a huge rumor.  Yeah.  A huge Kimmy rumor.  Like what?  I heard she was doing drugs.  I thought maybe something pertaining to her mouth.  No, we love her.  She's got a large mouth.  Huge mouth. 
[00:44:00]  We can't get a hold of her today.  I think CBS might have gotten a little pissed off at her.  Ah.  Well, we're all one big happy family.  Actually, I got a message from her.  She is out of state.  She fled the state?  She's been hiding.  Where'd she go?  Is she cool with everything?  She's out of state.  Is she cool with everything, Rick?  Yeah, she's fine with us.  All right.  She's cool with us.  What did that mean?  Yeah, what does that mean?  She's fine with us.  Yeah, she's tickled with us.  CBS having a problem, though?  I have no idea.  Look at Rick's not talking. 
[00:44:30]  No, I really don't know.  At every turn, have we just undermined the whole Survivor thing for CBS?  They give us interviews.  We totally screw up there.  We're at the point where they don't give us any more Survivor people on the phone.  But then we get Survivor people here in the studio.  We had three of them yesterday.  We had three of them in here yesterday.  We had Mitchell, the really tall guy.  We had Jeff.  And we had Kimmy.  And Kimmy.  And then not only do we have Kimmy in here, but she's totally naked,  then covered with a little bit of whipped cream.  And then one of our pals at the show, Jim Norton, gets to rub her. 
[00:45:00]  Hey, you didn't hold the super stoker to her head.  Jim Norton has the best luck, too.  The second national story that we created, and Jim Norton's involved.  He was involved.  All right, Jen.  Excellent.  Thanks a lot, you guys.  Let us know what happens, okay?  I will.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Is that girl getting naked out there for the whipped cream?  Yeah, they're setting up the area for the whipped cream.  All right, cool.  Well, Extra actually wants to talk to us also about the Mendy pictures.  But, yeah, something about Greenpeace and rolling them back into the sea. 
[00:45:30]  Not sure what that meant.  Opie.  Keep your hands.  Always make a chance.  Uh, too late.  And Anthony.  I'm just a flaming fan.  More stupidity on the way.  1027-WNEW.  Anthony, I want to thank Sam Adams for helping the radio show yesterday.  Yeah, beer equals good radio.  Yes, it does.  Always.  And we had some Sam Adams.  It wasn't in the studio, Opie.  It was right outside in the front, so people, our guests, could enjoy crisp, cool Sam Adams. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, because we're not allowed to drink and do radio at the same time.  No.  Sam Adams, the exclusive sponsor of Project Greenlight.  It's a joint effort between Project Greenlight, Miramax Films, and HBO.  The winner of this contest gets to a direct-his-own movie, which will be distributed by Miramax Films.  Chris Moore, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck are the executive producers of the film.  And the winner is this guy from Chicago named Pete Jones, who used to sell insurance.  Now he's in the movie business.  Old contest making of movie is being filmed, and it's going to come out as a 13-week special on HBO. 
[00:46:30]  The documentary is set to air early next week, and it's sponsored by Sam Adams.  Get involved.  Sam Adams.  Go to the store, pick some up, or when you're hanging out in one of the pubs, grab Sam Adams.  They've got the summer ale out now, and it's really good.  Sam Adams.  All right, Matt's getting there.  Assets kicked 10-4, but Piazza just hit his fifth of the year.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  Biopian Anthony.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW. 
[00:47:00]  I hear you okay, you okay, you okay, you okay, daddy.  You've been hit by, you've been struck by, a smooth criminal.  Howdy, maggot.  Alien and farm, Anthony.  Yeah, smooth criminal.  You love me, daddy.  212-757-1027.  Gorilla Boy, Jeff Norris in the studio. 
[00:47:30]  Jeff's on the bill tonight with Jim Brewer, Caroline.  With Brewer.  Tickets going fast for tonight's show with Brewer and Caroline.  Do it.  I'm surprised there are tickets available.  You're crazy if you don't go see Brewer.  Good morning.  Come down.  Come to Caroline.  Do it.  Jim Brewer's there.  Ron, what are you waiting for?  Do it.  Now we're having fun.  We're going to have a lot of fun tonight.  Brewer should be stopping by.  Stephanie McMahon calling in, and Tiki Barber as well.  We have the chicks.  Got a very hot lady outside the studio getting ready for the whipped cream bikini contest. 
[00:48:00]  I like that.  That's continuing?  Yes.  Yes.  15-year-old.  I like that.  Your whipped cream.  Give it to me.  Now.  Give it to me now.  This is legal, isn't it?  No, it's not, but I don't care.  Anthony, you were talking about John Montone, of all people.  Oh, of course.  I love listening to 1010 Wins to get all my information, hoping.  Congratulations to our old boss, Scott Herman.  Scott Herman now has the number one morning show over there in 1010 Wins. 
[00:48:30]  Who knew?  Reclaims the crown as the number one station in New York after many years.  In mornings, anyway.  In mornings, yes.  What is he doing?  He's doing stuff he ever did.  We don't think it matters that he does anything different.  I thought he was having his reporters, you know, get girls naked and stuff.  I know.  That's what's hysterical.  It's like, wow, we feel good.  We did well.  What did you do?  You broadcast the news.  Right.  It's not like you did it differently than you did last book.  I know what they're thinking.  Well, it was such a tough winter that people were tuning in news stations a little more than usual. 
[00:49:00]  Was that what it was?  There's no science to this radio crap.  Hello, John Montone.  We have nude women getting whipped cream put on them.  Yeah, it's the same thing.  Jesus.  Yeah, so I was listening and I heard, uh, maybe Montone's doing his reports naked.  I'm here on the street.  Totally nude.  My junk hanging in the breeze on the streets of New York. 
[00:49:30]  I'm John Montone.  10-10 wins.  I hear a story.  It sounds pretty awful.  It's horrible.  Whenever you talk about rape, it's horrible.  We know that.  And, uh, this lowlife grabs some girl and throws her in a vestibule and rapes her, steals some money and her cell phone.  So, uh, you know, she's pretty upset and the cops get there and, uh, they take her around and drive her around for a while and she can't find the guy. 
[00:50:00]  You know, they kind of do that.  So they get an idea and say, all right, look, call your cell phone.  This is a ballsy idea because they need the girl that just got raped to be brave enough to call her own cell phone that was stolen by the rapist.  And not sound like, you know, you know, while she's doing it.  Right.  Which has got to be tough.  Right.  They have her call her own cell phone.  This dope answers.  And then she goes, hey, why don't you come back?  Why don't you come back? 
[00:50:30]  It wasn't that bad.  Come back.  You know, I kind of need my, she said, I kind of need my phone.  And, um, you know, come on back.  We'll hook up again or something.  This guy comes back.  I didn't know.  40 minutes later.  Yeah.  He comes back with a swigging a 40 and, uh, the cops just pounce him.  Swigging the 40 for the money that, uh, he stole from her.  Yeah.  They recovered all of her money except for the three bucks for the 40 or something.  And she said, uh, look, it wasn't bad. 
[00:51:00]  Why don't you come back and meet me?  Yeah.  I shouldn't have used that line, huh?  No.  What a dope though.  And the guy, the guy came back, but I'm listening to 10, 10 wins and John Montone's got to always  editorialize it a little bit.  So it was like, um, a brave victim of rape and a rapist that is a moron.  He actually used the word moron.  He's doing these little news things.  And then he went through the story, you know.  And the moron actually came back. 
[00:51:30]  I'm John Montone, 10, 10 wins.  Breaking news.  I'm here on the streets with a whipped cream Speedo on to try to keep the number one morning slot in New York.  I'm John Montone.  I'm here as Judy DeAngelo supplies my Speedo. 
[00:52:00]  Hey, you got to give it to him.  Number one in the morning.  10, 10 wins.  But it's like, yeah, a rapist or a moron.  All right, John, you told him.  But the guy came back.  That's pretty stupid.  A genius.  Good.  Good thing he came back.  Yeah, without a doubt.  Sal, what's going on?  All right.  I want to talk about the whipped cream bikini contest.  Yeah.  You know, I don't think it's right that girls should be on there that have implants or celebrities or everything. 
[00:52:30]  They should be all natural.  You know what I mean?  What's the matter, Sal?  Sal, what's going to happen?  It's going to be up to you guys.  Yeah, well, I'm definitely going to vote for an all natural girl.  But I think anyone that should be on should be all natural.  You know, anyone that wants to do this can come on.  And then the voting is...  I can put on a woman's suit and I can come on there.  Sal, you know, we can tell you this much.  The girls that have the implants don't fare well in our contests.  Oh, that's right.  That's good.  I'm great to hear that.  Right.  Sure.  Said it before.  Sure.  Dead serious.  We had a best breast contest and all the ones with the fakies. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, I remember that.  I was happy about that.  I'm not into the implants.  I don't like that.  That's right.  Top three slots.  It's the old natural.  It's like getting a blow-up doll.  All right.  We're into the blow-up sheets these days, though.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you.  All right.  Nick, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Three quick things, really.  Yeah.  Number one, Stinky looks really odd in those pictures.  I was wondering if I had his number. 
[00:53:30]  Looks just like Stinky, right?  Yeah.  They did it side by side on the message board.  Number two, those pictures of Kimmy, if you look really close,  a little bit of whipped cream on her mouth,  kind of makes it look like she's doing something over there.  She finished doing something.  Well, those shots are going to be seen everywhere in the next few days.  Very nice.  And number three, about that.  We're always in it, man.  I tell you.  You guys are great.  And finally, about those that.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right, man.  We got the side-by-side shot of one of the contestants in the whipped cream bikini contest with Stinky  when he was getting ready to go down to Mississippi on opianthony.com. 
[00:54:00]  They look like they're twins.  They have similar eyes and a smile.  And then he did.  They put Stinky's head on the girl's body.  Stinky's head on the girl's body.  And it's pretty good luck.  DJ is a twin partner.  Wow.  I think Stinky's an engine.  I think he has part engine in him.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  212-757-1027.  Ron, what's going on?  Hey, guys. 
[00:54:30]  How you doing?  All right.  Just letting you guys know, if anybody's in the area, on 7th Avenue, between 52nd and 53rd,  you got live news shots going on.  What are they doing?  Got four different guys out there.  I'm on a terrible cell phone.  I'm sorry.  Helping us out as far as getting stuff going on on the live shots this season.  No.  We usually, I mean, last year, we were getting a lot of wows and gorillas running up behind  people and guys in gorilla masks.  Gumby.  Gumby was good.  The paper bag head guy.  And this year, though, not much. 
[00:55:00]  Best one ever, though?  C-word.  Oh, the A-bomb.  C-word on live TV.  Of course.  But we're still looking for that, people.  You know, you do it.  You come in with the actual sign that you used.  And we'll give you a little prize.  Sure.  And it's fun to see.  Especially in the winter when these two guys slid into the reporter and almost knocked  them down.  Laurie Alter.  I know.  Every time I see.  You know what happens now?  Every time you see these reporters on TV, you go, ah, that was the victim of the ice 
[00:55:30]  sliding thing.  Laurie Alter, yeah.  That's the victim of Gumby.  And then, what was her name?  Melissa Russo?  Yeah.  Melissa Russo was the one with the C-word.  There was no connection there, Melissa, if you're listening.  No.  It could have been anybody.  You were in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Could have been anyone.  Okay.  Let me go to Jack.  Jack, what's going on?  Yes.  How are you doing?  Um, I wanted to come down there.  Can I show you?  And I want you to whip cream me up.  Are you a guy being an idiot today? 
[00:56:00]  He's trying to do like Jerky Boy.  Yeah.  Ooh.  I want to show you my toolbox on the radio.  See?  It's Jerky Boy's, dude.  I know.  I love you, Obie.  I love you.  You just wasted some valuable radio time.  We could have played a commercial here.  But I love you.  But I love you.  All right.  Faggy.  All right.  Hey, Faggy.  Steve, what's up?  Hello, boys.  Hey.  Yes.  A couple things.  First of all, 20 minutes ago, driving home on the Garden State Parkway South, girl in 
[00:56:30]  a red Corvette, two girls driving along, all of a sudden I hear a horn.  I'm not really, you know, I know it's nice looking broad.  Turn around.  Bada bing.  Wow.  I just got the wow last week, the sticker.  Yeah.  So if I let anyone think that doesn't work, it works.  Of course it works.  We know that.  It works.  Thank you, Steve.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  Self-adjusted stamped envelope, 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106 for your wow bumper  stickers.  He sounds like the same guy.  So I put on the Gold Bond powder and my rash went away. 
[00:57:00]  Don't get people from, you know, Gold Bond's got to find different people or the whole different  campaign.  I know it's very grassroots and very down to earth, but when you see the TV commercials and  stuff, I'm disgusted by the Gold Bond commercials.  You want to think it'll make you feel good if you have a rash, I guess, or something, but  you don't need the people going, I have a chafing problem in my crotch, but a little  Gold Bond, or one guy going, my feet sweat a lot and sometimes I get a scaly rash between  my toes, a little Gold Bond. 
[00:57:30]  By that point, I'm not even listening to what he's using to get rid of this.  I'm just, I'm completely disgusted.  I have to turn the channel.  So Gold Bond, maybe you want to change your, uh, your campaign.  Hey, someone's asking us if we know why the job wasn't on last night.  Because they went through their run.  That was it, right?  They had six episodes or something?  Six episodes, that was it, and now they, uh, got to see if they picked up full time, but  now with the strike going on, it's going to mess everything up.  Yeah.  All right.  Ah, Tiki Barber!  Tiki! 
[00:58:00]  Hey, what's happening?  Hey, it's ONA.  What's going on, buddy?  Not a whole lot.  Hey, you sound really, uh...  Work out.  We can go do some other stuff.  Oh, man.  I can't wait until the season starts.  I get to sleep late.  You're not doing one of our WOW sticker stops today, are you?  No.  You sound like one of our, uh, guys that, uh...  Never mind.  Okay.  So you're working out more now than you would, uh, during the, uh, season?  Uh, absolutely.  Yeah.  Got to stay in shape.  Well, Tiki, you got, uh, you got the gig back on TV, right?  Yep.  I start on Monday.  All right, Andy. 
[00:58:30]  A little bit more to it, actually.  Yeah, you're going to be on CBS News in the morning doing the sports, right?  Yep.  It's 5 to 7.  5.  I get about 5, around 5.30 and 6 and around those times.  It'll be fun to get back out there again.  You sound like a guy that's been up since 5.30.  Hey, we have something...  You've got to make the most of your day.  Sleep is overrated.  Yeah.  We have something in common.  We've both got our eyes done by the same guy.  Dr. Philipson?  Yeah.  He's awesome, I'll tell you.  Isn't that...  I was apprehensive, but he put me at ease.  Isn't that like a gift from God, what they can do now with your eyes? 
[00:59:00]  I tell you, I mean, you go in one day...  Actually, I was working at CBS when I got it done.  Yeah.  And I went from getting the surgery at 7 o'clock that night to reading the news at 5 in the morning.  And it was no problem.  I was in a little dryness.  It was cakey.  Yeah.  He's really cakey.  You're bringing us down.  He's like, I'm all of a sudden, I'm falling.  You want to get a shot of espresso and call us back or something?  We're like high energy here. 
[00:59:30]  Well, what's happening?  You guys got to bring me up.  It's a cake message, right?  You know, I'll tell you this.  If you came down here today, we'd bring you up.  I know.  Because we've got a lot of cool stuff going on.  We've got...  What do y'all got going on?  We've got girls showing up and they're getting into their whipped cream bikinis.  Whipped cream bikinis?  Yeah.  We're having a whipped cream bikini.  Can I be my wife?  You have a very...  You have a very good-looking wife.  No disrespect to you, but when that whole Super Bowl thing was going on...  Oh, yeah.  Huge Jet fan here, Tiki.  It really was. 
[01:00:00]  You got some insight to what goes on when you're in the Super Bowl.  You're right.  You're right.  I have a documentary of my first Super Bowl ever.  My kids can watch that 20 years from now.  Yeah, they showed Tiki in his apartment or his condo, you know, packing, getting ready  to go to the Super Bowl, talking to his wife, footage of him on the bus.  You just watched it because of my wife, huh?  Well, she's fine.  She looked good at the whipped cream, the kid.  I tell you, that was.  Yeah, she definitely was. 
[01:00:30]  Bring her down.  Hey, bring me some ice cream.  Hey, so what was the first thing you did after the loss?  Oh, man.  God, it was frustrating.  But you had to keep it perspective.  It was just a game.  Yeah.  And fortunately, my brother was getting married like two weeks later.  So it forced me to stop thinking about the game and worry about, you know, some happier  things.  And that was great.  It's just got to be cool to be involved with something like that, though, man.  Oh, I tell you, it's an experience.  It's got to be cool to win it. 
[01:01:00]  What did you say, Tiki?  What did Ann say?  I missed something.  It's got to be cool to win it.  Well, yeah, but you're still in front of like a billion people playing, you know, a sport  you love.  Yeah, you're right.  You know, you've got to look at it like this, you know, and Dan Marino is probably one of  the greatest players ever to play the game.  And I've been to one of the many Super Bowls that he has.  Right.  And I still have more opportunities.  So that's the positive thing you've got to put on.  Right on.  I think we're going to just let you go back to sleep.  All right. 
[01:01:30]  Wait for my wife to get home.  Yeah, there you go.  Have your wife call up.  Do you want to come down here and visit us so we can do like a real thing where you hang  and get to know us a little bit?  We'll show you some things.  You have to get me on a better day.  I know we're going out to a crucifixionate, but I would absolutely love that.  All right.  We'll do that, Tiki.  Boom.  Hey, thank you.  No problem, guys.  All right.  Hold on one sec.  You want to talk to him?  No, just tell him to look for us on Monday morning.  Yeah, I'll do that.  Thank you, Tiki.  Thank you.  We're just going to let you go. 
[01:02:00]  Tiki Barber, everyone.  A little tired.  Hold on.  He's a good guy.  He's a very talented guy.  He's sore after the game.  He's just very, very tired.  He gets up very early.  I guess so.  Speaking of CBS, we're used to comics who get up at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and come  in all happy and peppy. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  Go ahead, Rick.  Yeah.  If anybody saw this morning on CBS News, we got this whole Survivor getaway contest promo  going on.  Yeah.  Look for you guys because you guys were taping the stuff the other day in the studio for CBS  and they're running it.  They ran it this morning.  They'll run it tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.  Yeah.  Each day at 630, we're going to choose one winner.  And basically, what they got to look for is the clue, the video clue that you see in like  a five-second snippet of what they show that morning. 
[01:03:00]  And at 630, that's when we're going to look for a winner for that.  So the Survivor Prize Pack fly out to L.A. for a couple days for the whole thing.  I think I just chugged NyQuil.  What do you got to do?  The last 10 minutes of radio is a blur.  But what do you got to do?  Look what they gave me.  But what do you got to do?  I watch the show and then I find it.  I watch Blue's Clues.  And then I, what do I do?  Kelly, explain what our listeners have to do. 
[01:03:30]  The birthday present for him.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  It's Anthony's birthday.  Thank you.  Oh, you know what?  Son of a bitch.  Kick her in the nuts and tell her to go home.  Kick her in the nuts.  Basically, the concept is very easy.  You want to go to, they do a TV thing.  Okay.  Watch CBS this morning.  They have their new news show from 5 to 7 in the morning. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Between, in the 6 a.m. hour, all of a sudden you're going to see Anthony and I doing some  stupid little, like, video vignette.  Something very quick will be on video.  You have to see that in order to answer the question that will be posed to you on this program  at 6.30.  At 6.30, two hours from now, we will say something like, hey, if you saw the video clip this morning,  this morning, what did Andy do?  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  What color was some garment or who said this line?  Right.  You just pay attention to the whole thing.  It's very quick.  And we will later ask you a question about what you saw in the morning.  Right.  We'll get five qualifiers.  One of them will win the trip to L.A.  and the others will get some nice stuff from CBS TV.  All right?  Right.  Right.  Could you bring Stalker Patty in and get this over with?  Oh, God.  I'm going to fall.  Huh?  You know what? 
[01:05:00]  We've got to get her in a whipped cream bikini.  No.  No.  I am not going to.  No.  Yes.  You've got to take the good with the bad, Rich.  Let Norris do it.  He needs a plug.  There you go.  Never mind.  That's that, man.  I'll go back to wedding.  Get her in here because we've got to take a break.  I don't want this to go on forever with us today.  No.  No.  Rich, you've got to make it fast and we've got to take a break.  Oh, hey.  What's happening, guys?  Hey, Rich.  I'm telling you, you were talking about rape.  That's what Jeff Norris does to every club owner after he gets paid.  Ah, boy.  Hey.  How's the drug habit?  What's that? 
[01:05:30]  Not bad.  I'm on the show tonight, too.  I'm Norton C.  I know you are.  What's that?  How's Norton C. doing?  I don't know, but why don't you do an impression tonight of someone who's still alive?  Okay.  Sure.  You stink.  How are you in that studio?  Please, go get them coffee.  Hey.  You know, you should be arrested for soliciting, you know.  Mickey Barber's been really depressed.  He was just tired.  Oh.  We're going to reschedule, get him in here and do up the whole interview the right way.  I thought I was maybe one of his relatives that got caught with a cell phone.  No.  He's been really out of it.  So you're on the bill tonight with Brewer and Gorilla Boy? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, I just called him to say hi.  I just thought he was playing golf, you know.  That's the kind of stuff I do.  All right.  How are you, Rich?  Hi.  How you been?  I'm doing great, man.  Attaboy.  Attaboy.  I got a nice girl flying in from Holland that I met.  Yeah, that's cool.  And what did he say?  Oh, the blind girl.  That's cool.  You know what?  He's getting funnier.  I'm telling you, if he could ever bring that stuff to the stage, he wouldn't be co-NC-ing.  Oh, that's good.  That's good. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  That's good.  Hey, what?  You going to talk about your kids again for the first 20 minutes again?  He's the only guy in his intro.  You might recognize him if you were in the lobby.  Hot dog.  The next guy comes to the stage.  Guy, brush his teeth.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Well, listen.  Are you guys coming down tonight?  I'm going to actually sleep tonight.  Oh, yeah?  I'm going to be there.  We're going to have a good time.  Yes, without a doubt.  All right.  I always ask for Brewer to headline on my shows when I'm hosting. 
[01:07:00]  He's such a great comic.  I had so much fun with him out in Vanderbilt.  Yeah.  That was a great gig.  Yeah.  It'll be great.  All right, Rick.  All right.  I'll see you down there.  Mitch, looking forward to seeing you, buddy.  All right, man.  I'll talk to you later.  All right.  Yeah, because you're all pals.  No, I do.  I love it.  Rich is...  You're going to make me say that crap.  I love that guy.  No, really.  No, watch the good...  Everyone who comes up here...  He's a brick, faggot, kid-touching son of a bitch.  But I love the guy.  I love the guy.  I'm just kidding.  He knows that.  Yeah, he knows.  I like his cap.  Comic thing. 
[01:07:30]  Hi, Stalker Patty.  How are you?  I'm fine.  How are you?  Good.  Hello.  Hi, Patty.  Hey, Patty.  You met Jay Moore recently at Caroline's?  Yeah.  And?  It was nice to see him.  Look how up she is these days.  You sure you're not on some kind of medication?  No.  That brought you up?  No.  You burst out of a shell.  You're like a new person.  It's a special sauce at McDonald's.  I don't eat McDonald's.  Oh.  I have a health...  I have a natural food diet. 
[01:08:00]  I can't...  Natural food?  What do you eat?  What do you eat?  I eat all vegetables, fruits, and grains.  That's all I live on.  No wonder you're 12 pounds.  Grains?  What do you like?  Grains of paradise.  113, 114.  113?  I weighed that at birth.  113.  Hey, Patty, you want to be in our whipped cream bikini contest?  Oh.  Patty.  Yeah.  Whipped cream bikini.  Whipped cream bikini. 
[01:08:30]  And it's a natural food.  Why not?  I think extra is going to want those photos, too.  Yeah.  Patty, would you be up to entering our whipped cream bikini contest?  I think you do all right.  Patty, Patty.  Well, did you well in the big A contest?  You did good in the ass contest.  You did very well.  No, you did well in the A contest.  You weren't in the last place.  People are saying you did a great job, and they loved your ass.  That's what I saw when I was reading instant feedback on the heroin. 
[01:09:00]  So what do you say?  Whipped cream bikini contest today?  I'm not used to being naked, though.  You're not naked.  So, you know, I...  Can I do it in the bathroom?  You could put it on in the bathroom, but then you've got to come out.  Okay.  All right.  All right, Rick.  There it is.  Rick.  Rick.  Hook up Patty.  No.  We are going to see Patty entering our whipped cream bikini.  And you know something?  Every time you do something like this, and I've noticed this, you come out of your shell  a little more.  You become more of a social animal. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  I'm kind of shy by nature.  But it's like therapy for you or something.  Patty, you got something for Ann?  Because we've got to move on.  Oh, what do you have?  I see Jim Brewer outside the studio, and he's coming in.  Hey.  Hey, Hammer.  I'll be out of the darkness, Hammer.  It wasn't in the refrigerator when I bought it.  It's the first gift that I really appreciate.  It's a can of Budweiser.  Yeah, she wrapped it.  I'm very impressed by you and your band.  It's like a Joey and Chandler Christmas gift. 
[01:10:00]  I worked for three weeks on this.  Faggot, making friends effort.  I was very impressed by you and the band during the last road show.  Yes.  So I...  Let me see.  Oh, look.  She's laminated a photo of me in my John Travolta three-piece white suit.  It looks like a little deco-podge.  She put a little...  It's deco-podge.  ...wood plaque and seems to have laminated it.  Hey, can I take a look at that?  It's a speedball art 8x10.  Hey, can I... 
[01:10:30]  Can I...  This thing, Patty, weighs a ton.  I know.  It's deco-podge.  It's deco-podge.  Can I take a look at that?  No, I'm not allowing you to look at that.  It's probably your thing on it to make it sign.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Shine much like yourself, Patty.  You'll be shining today in your whipped cream bikini.  Can I take a look at the...  No.  No.  You sure?  Let me see.  All right.  Here you go.  Ben and I just want to take a look at that.  You're welcome.  Thank you very much, Patty. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, there's something else in there also.  Uh-oh.  I played your birthday for three days because it does snap a lot.  Oh, oh, oh.  Look, look.  She gave me a number.  Look at this.  For three days is good for this.  This is sexy.  Wow.  She got you some lottery tickets and things.  Right.  ...tickets.  That's very nice.  I am putting that right over there.  Ben, can I see it?  No.  You're a little rough with that.  Yeah, right.  A little rough.  You know, I remember three years ago when you first came, you had this country star on. 
[01:11:30]  I forgot his name.  Yeah.  Country star.  And he gave you his guitar, the one with the museum and the hole in it.  Willie Nelson.  Willie Nelson.  Yeah, and everybody gasped when he gave you his guitar song.  Because everyone thought I was going to smash it.  Yeah, I'm going to smash Willie Nelson's guitar.  Willie Nelson's guitar for 50 years.  With, like, signatures of, I think, Buddy Holly on it.  No, like Muddy Waters and Eric Clapton and all sorts of autographs on Willie Nelson's guitar.  Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  All right, Patty.  Okay.  That was very nice.  Patty, thank you very much.  Now, if you would, Rick will take you to where you can get into your whipped cream bikini.  You can put the stuff there.  Thank you, Patty.  And we'll all be looking forward to seeing Patty in her whipped cream bikini.  In just a little while.  Yeah.  Sure.  Hey, Patty, someone on line three says you seem extra happy.  Did you get laid?  No.  Patty, any sex in your life?  No?  No.  You want some?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it's somebody I care about. 
[01:12:30]  You need it.  Rich Voss is in love with you.  You know what?  You don't have to save the balloon knot for marriage, though.  Oh, how about that?  Because that's really not an act of love.  Sorry.  That's an act of hate.  That's hate, Ronnie.  Somebody I care about.  And someone who cares about me.  Because I won't use my body for that.  Of course.  Very good.  Hey, can I see your birthday gift?  No.  No?  No.  I think we'll keep it right here next to me, where I can keep tabs on. 
[01:13:00]  No surprise.  No glass this time, Patty.  No glass.  And it's built like a goddamn D50.  You notice my presents are getting sturdier and sturdier?  Yeah.  Yours will be very sturdier.  She's going to come in here with a piece of marble in that glass.  I want you to a cinder block.  Okay, Patty.  I engraved this eye beam with the taste of...  I can't break it.  All right, listen. 
[01:13:30]  Patty, why don't you go get your whipped cream bikini on?  Patty, go get your bikini on.  Your whipped cream bikini.  Rick, help Patty.  Yes.  Help Patty.  Help Patty.  Rick, go ahead.  No, she doesn't care about me.  I don't want to be that...  Rick, you got to take...  Go take the good with the bad.  Come on, Rick.  You have to.  All right.  I do the bad all the time.  I'm not.  No, you have to.  All right, Ben.  Help out.  Thank you.  No, I got to be in here.  No, you don't.  All right.  Stinky, help out.  Just someone get her some whipped cream.  I have to go to the library and return books. 
[01:14:00]  Get her some whipped cream.  I need the plug.  And have her go into the bathroom.  Kelly.  You put on your whipped cream bikini.  Maybe Kelly could help.  Oh, Kelly.  There you go.  You like Kelly?  There you go.  Do you want to have a lesbian experience with Kelly?  He did great yesterday, too.  Kimmy did very good yesterday, yeah.  Who did good?  Kimmy.  Kimmy.  Kimmy.  Kimmy.  Kimmy is going to be all over extra tonight with those pictures.  Kimmy.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:14:30]  There you go.  I'm in all the rag magazines in the coming weeks.  Patty, if you would.  All right, Patty.  Help her out over there.  Patty.  Yes.  Patty.  Patty.  In the whipped cream bikini contest.  Let her in.  Let her in.  And what's going on with the other girl out there?  The hot girl.  I'm about to do it right.  She just jumped out the window.  Thank you.  Get Patty out there.  It'll make the other girl feel really good about herself.  There you go.  Kelly, help Patty out.  Get the whipped cream, and then let us know when.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  The show's starting to come together here. 
[01:15:00]  This is nice.  Dr. Patty getting into her whipped cream bikini.  Another girl getting into her whipped cream bikini.  We have Jim Brewer standing by to come in and say hi to us today.  Man, man.  Could people on Instant Feedback add any more O's to the word no?  I say no.  So that stuff is going to curdle as soon as it touches you?  Let me just touch it, because it seems really sturdy.  It's really funny how sturdy her gifts are getting.  See?  Remember the first thing she came in here and framed?  It was all just really fragile, and now she's just melting stuff to us. 
[01:15:30]  I'll just drop it on the desk.  Watch this.  Watch this.  It weighs.  You know, and the one thing about Patty, she lives and learns.  She's like Pavlov's Patty.  I can see the next gift she gives you is going to have a small vial of nitroglycerin.  And you smash it, and you're going to go up.  Either that or it will have an electric shock.  All right.  Our guests are backing up.  We've got Stephanie on hold.  Jay Moore is on hold. 
[01:16:00]  Jim Brewer outside the studio.  Gorilla Boy in the studio.  All right.  Quick break.  We'll be back with the mess.  It's Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  Ladies, come down to WNEW anytime between 3 and 7 for your chance to win the grand prize trip to Hawaii.  It's your body covered in our cream.  Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  1-0-2-7-WNEW.  Anthony, WWF, Backlash.  Backlash. 
[01:16:30]  Backlash.  In the aftermath of WrestleMania, who will survive the backlash as events spin out of control?  We can only watch and hope for an end to the chaos that follows as Castrol GTX presents WWF Backlash.  Live and only on pay-per-view this Sunday.  Anthony?  Yes?  You better do a good job with this live read because someone is listening in.  That's why I'm doing this.  Okay.  Hello?  Hey, it's John.  I haven't gotten Stephanie yet.  I'm just waiting for you guys.  You all set?  Yeah.  We just wrecked our bitch.  She was supposed to hear what we were just doing. 
[01:17:00]  I'm sorry.  All right.  If I knew it was you, I'd be the new tag team champion.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  The other tag team can't say anything.  All right.  Yeah, we're ready for Stephanie.  Okay.  Just give us two seconds.  I'll get her on the line.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Start over.  Anthony, WWF, Backlash.  In the aftermath of WrestleMania, who will survive the backlash as you've been spit out of control?  What the hell's that?  It's Dice from his garage. 
[01:17:30]  What is that?  What the heck is that?  Is it hold music?  It doesn't sound like hold music.  All right.  It's Vince McMahon playing the drums.  It's like one track of a song.  Well, of course, the new tag team champions, the Brothers of Destruction, The Undertaker, and Kane set out to show WWF champion Stone Cold Steve Austin and Intercontinental Champion Triple H. 
[01:18:00]  What it's like to be a badass.  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  You're interrupting our live read for the WWF.  I am?  Well, please continue.  The four most dominant forces in the WWF will wage war in a historic tag team match in which all three titles are on the line.  You like that?  That sounds good.  Yeah.  That was a good read?  That was very good. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, a little reverb.  That's good.  You need a little more emotion, I think, in it.  Mr. McMahon, Bill, that is sad.  No, WDW, you're overshaming that.  Who do you guys think is going to win?  What?  Who's going to win the main event?  Is Stone Cold going to remain the WWF champion?  Is Triple H going to remain the Intercontinental Champion?  Yeah, absolutely.  Stone Cold's a dick.  Uh-oh.  And if it's like any other storyline with the WWF, Stone Cold, Steve Austin will be the champion until, like, 2002. 
[01:19:00]  Really?  No, I can't see The Undertaker.  The Undertaker and Kane women.  Can't see it.  Really?  Can't see it.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, I don't think that'll happen.  Well, of course I support my husband, you know.  But, and speaking of my husband.  Your husband.  Your husband.  Yes.  You had Triple H on the show a few weeks ago.  Yeah.  And you had him spanking women.  Hey, he wanted you so bad.  What the hell is that?  I don't know what's wrong with that guy.  He doesn't seem too faithful to you, Stephanie.  This guy had his hand on a hell of a lot of ass. 
[01:19:30]  Damn.  That day.  That's just not right.  I mean, but you guys put him in a position.  Of course I don't blame him.  I blame you.  Stephanie was so cool.  He drew blood.  I think he broke some blood vessels in that chick's ass.  Damn.  It was great.  Her name was Peaches.  Well, now she knows what I go through.  Yeah, did he knock you around a little bit?  Oh, he only spanks real hard.  That guy is a lunatic.  And we love him.  I mean, he came in here and we expected one thing of Triple H, you know. 
[01:20:00]  What did you expect?  Well, the image that he puts across on TV and the pay-per-views and stuff is one thing.  But the way that guy really is, he is a pisser.  Yeah, we were scared.  Yeah.  We were really scared to meet him.  And he took it well.  We talked about China and how China looks like a man and stuff.  Well, has a man-ass.  Man-ass.  And it turns out, like, Triple H used to listen to us when we were up in Boston.  Oh, see?  Yeah.  Turns out he was a big fan of the show.  And then he almost stole Opie's girlfriend and there would have been nothing Opie could 
[01:20:30]  have done about her.  Like, he took a picture with Sandy and put his arm around her.  And Sandy's all giggling and, you know, because it's cool.  Right.  And Opie just looks at Triple H's huge arm and goes, if he just wanted to bend her over,  there would be nothing I could do about it.  Nothing.  But you'd die trying, right?  Nah, because I know secretly she wanted it.  Oh, man.  That's horrid.  That's pretty bad.  Yeah, but he turned out to be a really cool guy.  And Stephanie, that would free me up for you. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, well, that's true.  Oh, yeah.  That's another way to look at it.  And then we could have an inter-gender tag team match.  Well, no, I just want to, you know, all have sex.  Why do you have to bring wrestling into this always?  Well, you know, wrestling can be a fun part of sex.  If you've never tried it, you should.  Stephanie, do you and Shane and your mom and, of course, the patriarch of the family, Vince,  sit together in a room and laugh at the Opie and Anthony XFL pregame show? 
[01:21:30]  I actually don't think Vince had an opportunity to see it.  He was on it.  He was on it?  Because on Costas, he said that he had seen it.  There was never and isn't a pregame show.  Meanwhile, we interviewed him for it.  Yeah, that's what we did.  It was funny.  Well, I think because it was, you know, local.  It wasn't national.  It was New York, L.A., and Chicago.  Three of the, what, 16?  It's not, you know, completely national.  No. 
[01:22:00]  What the hell was NBC thinking?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Did you guys have fun, though?  We had a great fun.  We really had a lot of fun.  Did you stay with the XFL?  Did you watch it all the way through?  No, pretty much after we got fired, we pretty much told everyone how much it sucked.  Oh, man.  No.  Oh, stop it, Opie.  It's Stephanie.  Oh, yeah.  You didn't have to hear stuff like that.  We'll save it for Vince.  So you didn't watch for the end?  It got better. 
[01:22:30]  So you kept watching, then?  I did not.  You know, and we, I mean, all kidding aside, we did say this after the fact, too.  We never minded the XFL.  We thought it was cool.  Yeah.  I had fun.  You know, I like watching guys knock the crap out of each other on the field.  Yeah, there were some hard hits out there.  Yes.  If you watched the pregame show, you would have seen my little feature.  I did the top ten hits of the week.  Oh.  Yeah.  And then I had to watch, after we were fired, fired.  It's okay.  I was fired, too.  Remember? 
[01:23:00]  I was in the stands doing, you know, interviews and things.  I got fired.  You were fake fired.  You were fired.  I was fired.  You were fake fired.  You got fired.  Yeah, because Stephanie used to do little things in the stands.  Right.  And they fired you, too.  They fired me, too.  Wow.  Did Vince have to fire you?  No, no.  We let Vic Ebersole do it.  Stephanie, I'm sorry.  You're fired.  Look at the way he does that.  Take off your bra.  Take him off my bra.  No.  Yeah.  Why didn't you guys go to WrestleMania?  I hooked you guys up. 
[01:23:30]  I got to, you know.  You know something?  We were freaking out.  We had our vacation planned for like eight months before that happened.  You couldn't go for one night?  It was in the middle of, I was on a cruise.  And I was in the.  And he was, and Opie was in the Bahamas somewhere.  Turks and Caicos.  Great island.  And there was no way we could have gone.  But let me tell you, a rain check would be mucho appreciado.  Where's our invite to Backlash?  I'd go.  Yeah.  Where's that going to be?  How about the next pay-per-view?  Why does it always have to be the WrestleMania one? 
[01:24:00]  Well, because WrestleMania is the biggest.  I understand that.  They only want the best for Opie and Anthony.  Ah.  Exactly.  Take your bra.  Take it off now.  Crawl on the floor like a dog.  I want you to bark.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Bark like a dog.  What was your take on the whole Vince Costas thing?  Well, for a second there, I got nervous for Costas.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, it just went to show that he obviously didn't do his homework. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, he really didn't know.  He wasn't up to date on the WWF.  And the funny thing was, a couple of weeks later, he was on Jon Stewart's show on Comedy  Central.  Right.  And he's acting all bad.  And he's acting all bad and tough and coming up with answers to some of Vince's questions  and statements and answers.  Like, after the fact.  Right.  Sitting there with Jon Stewart going, yeah, well, oh, that's a, oh, oh, they haven't done  that in years.  Oh, yeah.  But they really went to some class programming.  Like, without Vince's finger in his face, he was all great. 
[01:25:00]  Well, of course.  And we were disappointed in Jon Stewart that he didn't stick up for, uh, yeah.  And still, I have a hard time watching Jon Stewart now.  He was, uh, he was kissing, uh, Costas's ass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, how many times, Stephanie, has, uh, that Vince finger been in your face yelling like  that?  Well, not too often with the finger.  But, you know, the yelling happens, uh, pretty much on a daily basis.  You know what, though?  I have a feeling Stephanie could yell just loud back.  If I have to go out in that car and find your panties in the backseat again! 
[01:25:30]  You know, I'm just picturing things like that.  Yeah.  Um, no, that didn't happen.  Nothing like that?  No.  Damn it.  No, I was very good about evidence, you know, I didn't really.  Yeah?  Leave anything around.  Uh, Steph, what is this Duchess of Queensbury match?  Yeah, we couldn't figure that part out.  Between, uh, Chris Jericho and William Regal.  Well, we saw an example of the Duchess of Queensbury, uh, tag team rules on SmackDown last night.  And really, I have no idea what these rules are.  It seems that it's a, you know, European standard. 
[01:26:00]  And I think that Regal is just gonna, you know, have to inform us at Backlash.  Is it boxing?  No, it's, uh, definitely wrestling.  But it's a certain style.  I'm not sure, you know, if it's done in rounds or just, just what it is.  I think, uh, the WWF is staying away from boxing ever since that one incident.  Wow, that rock.  That rock.  Yeah, let me tell you something.  That rock.  That was what, Butterbean and, uh...  Butterbean and, uh, Bart Gunn.  Yeah, whatever happened to Bart Gunn.  Whatever happened to Bart Gunn? 
[01:26:30]  Nice punch.  Knocked out cold, no fake crack whatsoever, and you never heard from him again.  Bart, uh, actually did some stuff in Japan.  I'm going to Japan now.  That was one of the best shots ever.  Ever.  That was pretty good.  That was a great knockout punch.  I don't know, Bradshaw took a pretty good one, too.  Yeah, yeah, he did.  That was really good.  I want to see that again.  Hey, how about the, uh, WCW, uh, WWF battle with, uh, your pops and, uh, your brother there? 
[01:27:00]  Well, you know, Vince is sort of taking it out on Shane by, at Backlash, putting Shane against the Big Show in a last man standing match.  Great.  Shane running around the rink some more.  Okay, Big Show chasing him.  Well, which way did he go?  I don't know.  I think it's pretty entertaining.  Shane usually puts a lot into his matches.  I like, I like the, the Shane that wrestles.  Stephanie, you never give us anything, though.  Give us a little piece of something.  Give us a little, little, little rumor.  Little tidbit?  Something that, yeah, little inside info. 
[01:27:30]  Like, are we going to see a WCW wrestler show?  Uh, you know, you're just, you're just going to have to watch, you know what I mean?  Because, you know, it's not like I'm just giving it away to you guys.  Yeah.  You know, there's a lot of people listening.  Okay, we'll take you off the air.  There, you're off the air.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's just, yeah.  Okay, now I'll tell you.  But you never give us anything.  Well, what do you want?  Could, could we see a WCW wrestler soon?  Possibly.  Wow. 
[01:28:00]  Possibly.  There's a chance.  I'll give you that.  There's a chance.  All right.  So that means it's not a no.  There's a chance.  Uh, could it happen during backlash?  That's all I'm going to say.  Oh, that means possibly during backlash.  Right.  Imagine how many more people will tune into backlash if you say yes.  A WCW wrestler will be there.  Those are your words, not mine.  You see him training and stuff in the facilities that you guys use?  Uh, not yet.  No?  No.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. 
[01:28:30]  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Could mean no for this, uh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Backlash.  All right.  Trying to get something.  Yeah, I know you are.  Yeah.  A couple people on the line want to say how beautiful you are, Stephanie.  Uh-oh.  No, I'm serious.  No, really.  No, we're not putting them on.  No, this isn't a year and a half ago.  You know, they're serious.  What do you mean a year and a half ago?  Steph, you cleaned up nice.  I got to tell you.  Right, right.  When you were playing the goody two-shoes chick, though, with the little, you know,  dress on in the boiler room, I don't know. 
[01:29:00]  No, now you got the leather skirt.  Yeah.  I got pants on in the boiler room.  We got the...  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  You got the leather motorcycle cap thing backwards.  Do you like the cap?  That's happening.  That was the Triple H cap.  That's available in our catalog.  Look at that.  You always sell that merchandise.  Your daddy taught you well.  Oh, yeah.  You were wearing a dress, though, at one point, like a long dress.  It was a long skirt.  It was a long skirt.  Yeah, okay. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, that's what I remember.  And I don't know, but you didn't have an attitude or any of the...  Yeah, it was very boring.  Very boring kick.  Yeah, and you've been working out.  You know what I'm...  That's obvious.  You know what I'm digging is the push-up bras.  Yeah, those guys.  Well, I need them now.  Now that I've been working out, you know, I sort of lost a little bit of what I had.  Yeah.  All right, Steph.  All right.  Well, you know what other match I'm looking forward to at Backlash this Sunday on Pay-Per-View?  Yes.  Is the 30-minute ultimate submission match. 
[01:30:00]  Yes, Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit.  Exactly.  Mm-hmm.  It should be actually a hell of a match.  So someone's got to submit, right?  Someone has to submit.  That's it.  But it's the number of, you know, the number of times that they submit in 30 minutes.  Okay.  Whoever, you know, whoever has more submissions wins.  Kurt Angle wins.  I don't know.  He is an Olympic gold medalist.  And Heartbreak Kid comes back this Sunday on Backlash.  Again, your words, not mine.  She's great.  She doesn't cry.  She doesn't.  Hey, you want to come down and be part of our whipped cream bikini contest? 
[01:30:30]  Do I get to judge it?  No, you've got to be in it.  You could be the second celebrity that we've had.  Yeah, but see, those other girls, they put me to shame, you know?  I can't do that.  Oh, no.  You obviously haven't checked the website.  Oh, but you know what I did check?  Yeah, you told me there were all those shots of me in my bra.  Yeah.  So I went, and there's actually a website that says, find Stephanie's thong.  Thong?  All these pictures of me, like, getting into the ring, like, candid shots.  It all zoomed in and everything. 
[01:31:00]  I couldn't believe it.  Was it good?  Like, could we see stuff?  Well, you could tell I was wearing a thong.  Any camel toe there, Esther?  No, no, no.  No?  Actually, and I think some of the comments were they were hoping for it, but couldn't say it.  Imagine, yeah.  Isn't it twisted what you can find on the internet?  It is, but I couldn't believe that.  I could.  And it says, you know, what Vince won't let you see.  Yeah, please, Steph.  Now, you know how many up the skirt shots we've seen on Raw's War and SmackDown over there? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  And when you're getting in that ring sometimes with those little skirts on.  It's difficult.  You know what, when you guys used to have the hose, there was a couple times that some  of those ladies didn't have anything on.  I know.  No panties.  Well, we've changed that.  I know, unfortunately.  You've got to bring that back.  Definitely.  Well, I know.  The hose were great, but, you know, advertisers don't like the hose.  Oh, please.  Well, you know, the PTC, they say that we, you know, it's prostitution and they're whores.  Those people are jack-offs. 
[01:32:00]  Aren't they?  PTC.  Don't let them influence you.  Well, they influence our advertisers, which is the problem.  You just get other advertisers.  That's what we do.  You guys can't wait with so much on radio.  It's ridiculous.  They always depend on WWF and Stacker 2.  That's right.  And there's plenty of porn sites that do great business with us.  Right.  You've seen China and everybody else in the Stacker 2 commercials, right?  Yeah.  Kane has new Stacker 2 commercials out. 
[01:32:30]  One of our friends is in one of the Stacker 2 commercials.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  The guy that gets pummeled by the gang of football players.  Right?  I guess they were running it during the XFL.  With the XFL cheerleaders?  Yeah, that's our buddy.  He's walking around here somewhere today.  Oh.  Did I meet him before?  I don't think so, no.  Jeff Norris, Gorilla Boy.  You want to fire him?  I don't want to fire him.  I don't know.  Do you want me to?  It's like everybody around here should be fired by a McMahon.  All right.  We got to go.  Yeah. 
[01:33:00]  You guys are going to watch Backlash, right?  Backlash live this Sunday, 8 p.m.  only on Pay-Per-View.  Call your local Pay-Per-View provider and order today.  Backlash.  And watch Triple H and Austin defeat the team of Taker and Kane, the tag team champions.  Just like the doting wife.  By the way, that's a great storyline.  Yeah.  Making Stone Cold bad again.  That's great.  Yeah.  He's a pretty bad character.  It's really good.  I like what he did to Alita.  Well, even better, I like what he's doing to J.R.  Oh, yeah.  That was pretty good.  It's just so sad. 
[01:33:30]  J.R. can make you cry because he's so pathetic in that role.  Yeah, he plays that role well.  And I know behind the scenes at the WWF he has a lot of power, but to see him in front  of the camera looking so pathetic is, oh, God.  You start crying at all.  Yeah, you feel bad for him.  You feel sorry for the guy.  Well, I don't, but you might.  All right.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  And the next time I give you tickets, I expect you to use them.  We will.  Or you'll give us a spanking.  Exactly.  Well, no, then, you know, then maybe you wouldn't. 
[01:34:00]  Triple H will give you a spanking.  No, thank you.  Yeah, but he does that anyway.  All right.  All right, Steph.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  Stephanie McMahon, everyone.  Yes.  Backlash on pay-per-view this Sunday.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Jim Brewer's been waiting like a half hour to get in here.  We've got to take a quick...  I think we were in the break.  All right.  Oh, Christ.  We'll play a couple more commercials, and we'll be back.  It's WNAW.  Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest is brought to you by WhippedCreamBikini.com.

It's Planet Java, the wildest thing to hit the streets in a long time.  Keep an eye out for the Planet Java sampling trucks.  They hit the streets.  They're coming to an area near you with the flavors, cool flavors. 
[01:35:00]  Javadelic, Trimble, and Karamocha.  Javadelic's a grown-up milkshake.  Perfect low-fat mix of milk and coffee.  Karamocha, it's chocolate.  It's caramel in a coffee.  What the hell is it?  What the hell is it, Tony?  It's a dessert.  It's a morning drink.  It's a great mixer.  Perfect.  And Trimble.  You need an extra kick in your day.  How about 121 milligrams of caffeine?  That'll do the trick.  Trimble's the highest caffeinated drink in the country.  So students, truckers, moms, anyone who needs a boost is going to love this one.  Trimble does the trick deliciously. 
[01:35:30]  Be yourself with Planet Java iced coffee with an attitude and available wherever Coca-Cola  products are sold.  If your retailer doesn't have Planet Java, say, hey, get some Planet Java iced coffee.  It just got cool.  And it's called Planet Java.  Something crazy is happening here.  There's something wrong with us.  How do we try what's in my hands?  Something very, very wrong with us.  What's a little contradiction to the delinquency of a minor?  The OPS Encination.  It's really bad.  It's really good.  This could only mean one thing, Anthony. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  And one thing only.  Right.  What would that one thing be?  I don't know.  Oh, no.  That's a show to go.  He's got the sunglasses on.  Watch that.  You're the Kitsapob. 
[01:36:30]  Oh.  You're going to blow your voice out. 
[01:37:00]  I want to punch a Mexican. 
[01:37:30]  That's how that's done right there.  He's such a frustrated rocker, frustrated rocker. 
[01:38:00]  Let's stop for a second, dude, I'm sorry I know you got the gaydar on and you don't want  to acknowledge your birthday, you know why though, these guys need to come out with a  new birthday song, right here, then it wouldn't be gay, because you're probably going to go  home tonight and be like, I'm going to sing to Anthony right now. 
[01:38:30]  I hope he's in the back, I'll be in a second, he knows I'm wishing him a happy birthday.  I hate the singing.  Stick a donkey in my pooper, there's nothing gayer than that.  No one knows who's going to start first, it just starts out, happy birthday to you, happy  birthday.  And no one can say.  And then you realize half the people in the room don't even know your name, get to the name 
[01:39:00]  part.  Happy birthday to you.  Then there's the jackass aunt that's too drunk and she just, you're a wonderful person and  we love you.  Do you know how much we love you?  Lucy, come back, go outside.  Go crap herself.  I love her.  Cut the cake.  Let me get a picture.  I'm cutting the cake.  Get the camera, put on the flash please.  I just bought it in my purse, go in the room.  Will you listen to me?  Charlie, get all the goddamn pretzels. 
[01:39:30]  I'm not going to tell you again.  Okay, goddammit, it's an ice cream cake and I told you to take it out of the freezer  two hours ago.  Now, Artie, put the knife under hot water.  Can someone get me a napkin that's cracked stuck to the dog's tail and he's wiping it  all over the goddamn rug.  Take him outside, he's got a crap.  I'm so happy you're here for your birthday.  Yeah, isn't that great?  You know, it was like ACD.  Stop!  God be mercy!  Kill you!  Stop! 
[01:40:00]  You're looking cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The heavy metal version of happy birthday.  Happy birthday!  Happy birthday!  Duffy!  Duffy, get over here.  There's crap sticking all over his goddamn tail.  This is ridiculous now.  Mom, please don't put him to sleep.  Oh, Jesus.  He just clapped off.  Oh, God.  I just...  I have not cleaned up goddamn dog diarrhea.  Duffy, come on.  You gotta crap.  He's gonna die!  I can't see a little dog without going, Duffy!  I call every little dog Duffy now.  Come on.  Let's sing, huh?  Let's sing, huh? 
[01:40:30]  I have not cleaned up goddamn dog diarrhea.  I am not cleaning up goddamn dog diarrhea.  I'm gonna get sick, huh?  I'm gonna get sick, huh?  Oh, God damn.  Duffy, come on, you gotta crap.  Oh, yeah.  He's gonna die!  I can't see a little dog without going, Duffy!  I'm going to get sick.  Oh, God damn it.  Duffy, come on.  You've got to crap.  He's going to die.  I can't see a little dog without going, Duffy.  I call every little dog Duffy now.  Come on, let's sing happy birthday to Anthony.  Larry, come inside.  We're singing to Anthony now. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, the big ritualistic lighting of the candles  where if the guy that's having his birthday sees it.  Keep him out of here.  Keep him out.  I'm lighting the candles.  Now turn the lights out.  Oh, what's going to happen next?  Holy moly.  Well, they come up with the excuse.  Everyone else leaves the living room  and then all of a sudden they go phone call in.  Phone call in.  Here it comes.  Happy birthday.  You always walk into it, do you?  Yeah, you do.  You walk into the kitchen.  This is your crap.  I walked into it again. 
[01:41:30]  The birthday bear trap.  It's like, oh, they got me again.  Damn it.  I'm gazing when they put on those candles that don't burn out.  Yeah, oh, that old gag.  Don't be a dick.  What's the matter?  You can't blow out the candle, can you?  Try it again.  Try it again.  You look like such a dick.  You're the fat drunk friend.  Look out, faggot.  I can do it.  I'm spitting on it. 
[01:42:00]  Spitting on the cake.  Can we get high dick?  My mother's here.  Sorry, Mrs. Brouwer.  100-year-old relative, I'll take a small piece.  Give me a very small piece.  I'm talking like papyrus, small.  Something that has been banged from wood pulp into a thin piece of paper, small.  Too big.  Too big.  Share it with me.  Strawberry or chocolate.  Oh, look at the split cake.  I want the piece with the rose on it.  What do you want to hear the gay lemon stuff in the middle? 
[01:42:30]  Oh, it looks great on the outside.  They cut it, and it's like, it's lemon-filled.  That makes me want to punch a Mexican.  Lucy, don't put no goddamn yellow crap in the middle.  There's two things I don't like, Mexicans and yellow crap in the middle of a cake.  What do I work for in this country?  Ruin a good cake.  I like the old days where, you know, you're flat-ass broke with your friends, 
[01:43:00]  and come over with a dopey, big, like, candle sticking out of a cupcake.  Happy birthday, dude.  You got any beer?  Yeah.  They punch you.  You got to get your punches.  And what for good luck?  21, faggot.  Ow.  Dude.  Ow.  Hey, that's good stuff.  Yeah.  That's funny.  Oh, man. 
[01:43:30]  Like a candle that goes in a candelabra.  It's jumped right through it.  Happy birthday, dick.  Andrew has something to say.  Andrew.  Hey, a goat boy.  Don't blow out your voice with that ACDC crap,  because I'm going to go see you tonight, all right?  Oh, don't worry about me, man.  If you can't talk, I'm going to kick your ass.  I'm going to say I'm creeping bad like a goat.  You know something?  She, faggot.  I want my money.  I didn't hear him bad like a goat.  You talk about that on stage, like the people just coming up to you, all drunk, saying, you know, 
[01:44:00]  dude, do the goat boy.  Do the sheep guy.  We were in Boston.  Went out with Brewer one night in Boston.  It's two in the morning.  Like they're closing this place down so we can just hang and drink.  And they're trying to chase everyone out.  Right.  This one guy would not leave.  He kept coming back and just going, blah, blah.  Like trying to do it right in Brewer's face.  There was two things he was doing.  He was coming up.  There was one.  Remember he had a catchphrase or something? 
[01:44:30]  What the hell was his catchphrase?  I can't even remember.  But it was the most annoying.  And we heard it a thousand times.  But I can't remember for the life of it.  Every time we're in the middle of the story, like, so anyway.  And then he'd go through the whole saying goodbye thing again.  He'd shake it.  No, bro, I'm just going to say, man.  Kick-ass.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  And he'd walk away.  I don't want to bother you.  I don't want to bother you.  So he'd walk away.  I didn't listen to that.  I'm not here listening to it.  I came home one night and I was, I was heffed up, man. 
[01:45:00]  I was heffed up.  I was chasing his bride all night.  I punched a Mexican in his face.  It was a long time.  But, dude, came home.  And all of a sudden, I see you.  Listen, I'm not going to bother you.  So he'd leave.  He'd go by his friends and we're just laughing at him the whole time.  And then we think we're rid of him.  Yeah.  And his friends are going, Dick, leave him alone, you dick, man. 
[01:45:30]  You're supposed to hang out.  Dick.  No, he was cool, man.  Like, we were hanging.  That guy was cool, man.  And, like, a minute later, we're talking about something.  Hey, now, listen.  So, hey.  Dude, my friends are saying I'm being a dick and I'm sorry.  You know, I'm telling them you're cool.  You're cool.  And the friends are just laughing.  Because wouldn't you be laughing at balls of you and this guy's friends?  Look at him.  He's being a dick again.  That was great.  He came back and he's like, am I being a dick?  No, no, no, not at all. 
[01:46:00]  And you're too nice to say.  Then he came back and I think he was like, you know, you're real people.  You're real people.  You're real people.  You're people, man.  You're approachable.  You're a great school.  He looked him right in the eye.  Looked him right in the eye and started going, blah, blah, blah.  What the hell?  It's not happening in any other situation.  You'd punch him in the face.  Exactly.  You'd think a guy was on something.  What are you doing? 
[01:46:30]  That's funny.  Blah, blah.  Hey, we got something for Brewer.  Uh-oh.  What you got?  I don't know if you've heard this because you've been traveling lately, right?  Yeah, a lot of you.  Big ACDC fan, right, Brewer?  No, don't even say it.  What?  What do you got?  This is something I want to play for you.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I...  Did you hear this yet?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's his name.  We went on the road and our bus driver is this guy from, like, Tennessee.  Yeah.  No, where was he from?  Somewhere south.  As soon as we get on the bus...  What's playing?  Yeah, she's like, you ever hear her ACDC? 
[01:47:00]  ACDC?  I said, what?  He goes, you know, ain't no Negroes in the band.  ACDC.  God damn good American white music.  Boy, they take ACDC for that way.  What do you see me?  Alabama male.  What was that?  What was that?  From South Park.  South Park.  Alabama male.  Alabama male.  Male.  Alabama male. 
[01:47:30]  It was an action figure commercial on South Park.  Oh, this is your drumming place.  No, this is ACDC.  Oh, they're living easy.  Living free.  Easy city.  Don't know what way to ride.  Asking nothing.  Yeah.  But me.  What's the heck?  Can't get me a friend with my stride.  Don't need reason.  Don't need rap.  There ain't no matter what you're doing. 
[01:48:00]  Don't need rap.  Don't need rap.  Don't need rap.  You can't get me a friend with your stride.  We can make me some air.  I'm going to play.  How the way to ride.  Thank you, sir.  How the way to ride.  Bring it in.  How the way to ride.  I'm going to be.  How the way to ride.  That's right, Grant.  We like that.  Yeah, I get to listen to that, too.  You know.  I think I hit the second song.  I was like, all right.  No, this sounds cool. 
[01:48:30]  Can you play it later?  Can you play it later, right?  Yeah, great.  Who's going to do it later?  Right before I go to bed.  I'm going to go to sleep now.  People want to hear Joe's song.  Brother Joe's song.  Joe's version of.  I heard that yesterday.  Yeah.  It was great.  Joe did a cover.  Joe did a country cover of Stephen Lynch's song, A Special Olympics.  Good God.  Who's this?  Come in here.  What's up?  Who are you?  Who is that girl?  Where?  And then the George is shot.  You get blown off on your own show.  Oh, my goodness. 
[01:49:00]  Won't you come on in here?  Please tell me you're going to be in the whipped cream bikini contest.  Here, get on mic.  I have one thing to say.  You're going to love Hawaii.  I've got to tell you, you are going to love Hawaii.  Take pictures.  Take pictures and let us know how you love Hawaii.  Good God. 
[01:49:30]  Who are you?  Well, I go by Dallas because I'm from Dallas.  Oh, that's a good thing.  So they call you Dallas.  Good thing you weren't from Trenton.  That'd be stupid.  I'm Trent.  She's blonde and perfect.  Wow.  And what brings you here?  Well, my friend told me about the contest.  You wise, clever devil.  Would you be taking him if you win?  Well, I guess since he brought me here, yeah.  See, this is what you've got to do. 
[01:50:00]  You've got to do.  You know, we put this out there.  We say, girls, come down.  You get in a whipped cream bikini.  If you are deemed the winner by our voting audience on the Internet, you will go to Hawaii.  You and a guest.  And the girls are like, okay, a couple of girls come down.  I don't understand why guys don't grab the hottest chick you can find and go, hey, let's go to Hawaii.  You just come on in and that's it.  And that's exactly what you did.  Where did you meet Dallas?  You worked together.  I was talking to the mic. 
[01:50:30]  See?  So you said, you heard the contest and you said, hey, this is a ringer.  Yeah, he called me last night.  He told me to go online and look up all the other girls.  And you said, this is a piece of cake, right?  Do you guys have any relationship at all?  No.  No, just friends and you would...  I'm single.  You're single?  Oh.  The roller test fell on the floor.  He's unconscious.  He's bleeding from the ears. 
[01:51:00]  You must be a real bitch.  No.  Why are you single?  Yeah, why are you single?  I'm divorced.  I'm a single girl.  Yeah.  Not much fears and queers in Texas.  All my exes live in Texas.  Hey, good.  Welcome to New York.  Get her to flash.  Get her to flash.  Get her to flash.  Do you like bowling?  Have you ever been nude or semi-nude in front of people, aside from people you're being romantic with?

Yeah.  I did win a trip to Jamaica, but I never got to go.  Would you win it on our show?  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  We'll fly you there.  We'll give you the plane when you're done.  We don't care.  You're not going to get it anyway.  Talk to a guy named Bill.  We'll meet you there.  Are there pictures of you on any websites? 
[01:52:00]  A lot of people are asking that.  No.  Well, would you be willing to wow the studio here?  Sure.  All right.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  All right.  A little wowage.  It's got a little tube top on.  I'm sorry.  I don't know what it means.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, God.  Now, contractually, you are obligated to watch.  Wah, wah, wah.  All right, O.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah, you give a flash?  Okay, sure.  Why not?  It's a flash.  We do have a star in the studio, Jim Bruce.  Yes.  Wow.  There you go.  Now, I can take it, since you don't know what wow is, you're not very familiar with this 
[01:52:30]  program.  That's correct.  That's okay.  It's okay to say.  You're the fan of the show.  I couldn't get it in my house.  I couldn't get it.  Yeah.  I'm in Connecticut.  And what do you usually like?  What do you listen to?  Everything.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You like country?  Because you're wearing a hat now?  Not really.  What, do you like dance music?  Yeah.  Stuff like that?  Yeah.  All right.  So, you do like bowling.  You like the bowl there, bro. 
[01:53:00]  I'm really good.  You know, it's so funny.  You have a hard time acting like a dick in front of a bowling, but I really like it.  Great.  And she's here for the whipped cream bikini thing.  And I think these two might be going on white.  Say hi to Don Ho.  You know what's weird?  Dr. Patty's been waiting outside in a towel for the last hour.  No one's paying attention to her. 
[01:53:30]  We're like, we're trying to get her naked immediately.  It's going to be a closed contest.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Rick, would you like to help?  Yeah.  Yeah, look at him.  Yeah.  Yeah, look at him.  You are a jackass.  Hey, you better watch what you do here, my friend.  Rick, hopefully you got perfect timing.  We need her naked in 19 seconds.  Hey, do you like food?  When we take a commercial break.  So we can go outside. 
[01:54:00]  Me too.  I love it.  She's frightened.  Yes.  Another hot girl in the studio.  Your name?  Aya.  Aya.  Aya.  I'm kind of pissed because she got her pictures done while we were talking to Stephanie McMahon  and I want to, you know, check it out a little bit.  We always do, like, maybe seeing a live version of what we would see in the pictures.  Unless you're Stalker Patty or Mendy or half of the other contestants we've had so far.  Wow.  You familiar with the show? 
[01:54:30]  Of course.  Somebody sent you a good.  Very good.  Very good.  Came by on your own accord.  This guy just got himself, like, a ringer that he works with and decides to try to get  himself a trip to Hawaii.  You're brilliant.  I don't understand.  That's what's been in my head.  I don't understand why more guys don't do this.  I'd be in the second.  I'd be trolling the strip club.  I mean, that's a bang.  You're like, listen, they've got great pot over there.  Separate ways.  Help me out, man.  Yeah, I'll get my own room, you know.  Go bang wherever you want to bang. 
[01:55:00]  Help me out.  I'm in the pot.  Line up for 20 surfer dudes, for all I care.  I just want to go to Hawaii.  Yeah.  Great.  All right.  Good job.  Okay.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I'm okay, Nicky.  Her pictures are up.  Aya, right?  Aya's pictures are up on WNEW.com.  Came out great.  Came out great.  Very good.  And Dallas is getting her pictures done immediately, right, Rick? 
[01:55:30]  Of course.  Yeah, what are we waiting for?  There we go.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Wow.  All right.  The competition heating up, Opie.  I'm very pleased with the outcome.  Me too.  It's getting better and better.  Yeah.  Days go on.  A trip to Hawaii to give away.  And we still have Stalker Patty.  Oh, yeah.  Is she still out there with her towel?  I think it'd be kind of cool if she won.  Oh, you think it would be?  Like a Simpson?  I think that would be pretty cool.  Oh, yeah.  That'll happen.  Yeah.  I wasn't even that crazy to do. 
[01:56:00]  Like to do that?  It'll happen if you give everything to one of our listeners.  Pod.  Wouldn't it be funny if you just voted for her and she'll win?  Dude, wouldn't it be funny, man?  Dude, check it out.  I'm voting for Stalker Patty.  All right.  A bunch of people want to hear Brother Joe's Special Olympics song.  All right.  We'll take a break.  It's a remake.  It's a remake.  Well, yeah.  Country version.  Well, yeah.  By Joe.  Still funny.  Very funny.  Hey, man.  Actually, let me hang out.  I got a...  Oh, you got to take off already?  Yeah, I got a head doctor.  But I thought we were...  What do you got a head doctor?  I'm at 545.  I'll come back.  What do you got, sinusitis? 
[01:56:30]  Exactly.  What's that?  This is...  I know exactly what that is.  It's not really hot.  Can I tell everyone?  Yeah.  Jim Brewer went to Dr. Philotoff, Diamond Vision, 1-800-984-2020.  Tell everyone what you're seeing now.  2010.  I mean, before this, beyond blind.  How does that work?  Ten minutes.  It's like an alien.  You're all better. 
[01:57:00]  Cool.  Ted Williams saw 2010.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  I'm seeing 2015.  I thought that was cool.  But Jim's seeing stupid stuff now.  Right.  I couldn't smoke for days because I was paranoid.  Because my friends are like,  Well, man, you can't do that because your eyes dilate.  You're corny.  I couldn't even do that, man.  Pop your eye out of your head.  You're like, retina's going to fall out.  What if, like, I have...  My eyesight's fine.  Right.  What if I went in?  Could I get better than fine? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Possibly, yeah.  No, seriously, yeah.  I would rock.  Like, like, X-ray.  I would get X-ray vision.  Yeah, I can...  Like, if I have normal vision and he does it as good as you, I'd see through a wall.  The girls would just come along the way.  Like, nah, already...  Yeah, I'm seeing right through their clothes.  It's amazing.  I could burn holes in brick walls.  Watch.  Back to fill it off.  Be great.  And be the new Godzilla.  Yeah.  All right, bro.  Caroline's tonight.  You're coming back?  You don't have to.  No pressure.  It depends on who this guy is.  If I'm out of here, and if I'm out of here in, like, ten minutes, it's on Madison and, 
[01:58:00]  like, 55th.  You're kind of stupid, though, because Dallas is going to be completely naked in less than  five minutes.  What are you doing, man?  Cancel.  What are you doing, man?  Cancel!  I'll be a little late.  I'll be a little late.  How often do you get to see something like that?  That?  Oh, yeah.  Big star.  I forgot.  No.  Look at him.  Come on.

[02:51:00]  Give me your everything  Yeah  Give me my sticker  They're making a left  Right  They're trying to squeak behind this cab  Who is in the box  Blocking the box  So they're making a left  They just squeak past the cabby  Without hitting the rear of them  To make the left  The second they get around them  To make the left  The cabby decides also  He's going to make a left  So he plows into them  You get the scenario there  Sure  So technically it doesn't sound like  It was the  Whoever was driving the NEW van 
[02:51:30]  No one's fessing up  So whoever's driving  I just found out for a fact  Earl actually was not driving  Earl wasn't driving  Actually it was not Earl  Oh  That's why it wasn't  The NEW van's fault  But then Earl's like  The guy gets out  The cabby and starts demanding money  That's what they do now  No matter what the accident is  He could  He could  A cabby can pop the sidewalk  Hit a field trip  From Long Island  That's going to Museum of Natural History  Get out and start demanding  Their lunch money  Give me money  You broke their headlight  Mommy  Can we go into the
