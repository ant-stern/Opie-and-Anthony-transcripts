<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious debate surrounding President Obama's proposed healthcare plan.  The hosts and callers vehemently criticized the plan's cost, the proposed tax increases on high earners (especially those making over $250,000, citing regional cost-of-living discrepancies), and its perceived socialist nature.  Frequent profanity and racial slurs punctuated the discussion. Callers shared personal anecdotes about the plan's negative impact on their families and businesses, highlighting the financial struggles even for those earning substantial incomes.  One caller, a New Jersey resident, revealed earning $268,000 annually yet still facing financial hardship. A union sheet metal worker expressed concerns about union-funded healthcare costs.  Patrice O’Neill, a co-star in an upcoming film, called in to argue the debate was less about money and more about government control. Audio clips of President Obama were played and dissected, with the hosts and callers focusing on perceived inconsistencies in his statements.  The segment concluded with continued criticism of the healthcare plan and the government's economic policies.

The show then transitioned to a broader discussion of economic issues, including government spending, welfare programs, and the struggles of small businesses.  Callers voiced frustrations about wealth inequality and perceived government waste. Mike from Haverhill, Massachusetts, described the hypocrisy of seeing wealthy individuals while struggling financially. Doug from Charleston discussed the history of congressional summer recess.  The bailout of General Motors and subsequent executive bonuses sparked outrage, contrasted with the struggles of average citizens.  The conversation touched upon tort reform and healthcare, with a hospital intern from the South Bronx providing anecdotal evidence of welfare abuse.

The conversation abruptly shifted to music, focusing on the new Alice in Chains album and Lane Staley's legacy. Opie and Anthony discussed past interactions with Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney, who were scheduled to be guests later in the show.  The hosts then moved on to the rape accusations against Ben Roethlisberger, offering their opinions and discussing the legal process. They also discussed a video of a co-worker, Steve, and the fallout (or lack thereof) from a significant on-air incident, an ESPN video containing a virus, and a police officer accused of stealing donuts.  A discussion of a 40th-anniversary Penthouse magazine featuring the show followed, along with a video of Bobo, a co-worker, at his father's grave. Numerous calls contributed to this rapidly changing segment.

The next segment began with a discussion of movies (*500 Days of Summer*, *Patch of Blue*, *Jungle Fever*, *Elf*, *District 9*, *Bruno*, *Borat*, and *Independence Day*), transitioning to social media, particularly Twitter, and the opinions of celebrities like Larry King and Kevin Spacey.  Studio guests Jim Norton and Andy Levy (from Red Eye) joined Opie and Anthony. A significant portion focused on US healthcare, featuring Dr. Aaron Carroll, who advocated for single-payer healthcare.  The hosts, guests, and Dr. Carroll debated the system's pros and cons, including lawsuits, quality of care, costs, and potential consequences.  The discussion became increasingly humorous, with many tangents.  Dr. Patrice O’Neill joined later.  Jim Norton promoted his stand-up tour. The segment was characterized by profanity and sexually suggestive humor.

The final segment featured another discussion about healthcare reform, this time with an unnamed pediatrician and researcher. The discussion centered on the potential impact of government-funded healthcare on care quality, doctor salaries, and malpractice insurance. The doctor argued that while funds would be redistributed, overall healthcare spending wouldn’t change significantly, and that the current system already implicitly caps doctor earnings.  The hosts expressed skepticism about equal care distribution under a socialized system.  A significant portion was dedicated to debunking health myths from Dr. Aaron Carroll’s book, "Don't Swallow Your Gum."  The show then welcomed Kristen Davis ("Manhattan Madam"), who discussed her experiences running an escort agency, including anecdotes about high-profile clients and her alleged interactions with an unnamed governor.  The interview touched upon the challenges and risks of her profession. The segment concluded with plugs for the guests' upcoming appearances and projects.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  60 40 and go and go this might surprise you this might surprise you yeah i'm losing faith in uh  obama yep a lot of people uh and you know i was uh i was uh rah rah obama yep even though i'm not  rah rah uh system i hate the system in general no it's what i was like a little excited about this 
[00:00:30]  obama guy and uh the last week or so he's losing me between the mom jeans and the 60 40  yeah and his approval rating by the way down to 44 percent that came out yesterday and he was what  in the 60s a mere month ago mere couple months ago he was in the messiah range uh during the election  yep um and now yeah some people are starting to go like hmm does this guy know what the fuck he's  doing we're heading toward a uh 60 40 split with the government meaning we pay 60 yep we pay 60 we pay 
[00:01:00]  60 i was getting a little nervous when it was 40 i started getting nervous when it went 50 50  dude it's crazy you can't take you can't you can't sure can that's insane they sure can it's absolutely  insane with his wonderful wonderful um uh ideas on health care which by the way i don't even think  it's written he doesn't really have an idea um uh as to what the whole bill is about yeah even he 
[00:01:30]  was questioned and said well i'm not i just have to look and see i'm not sure of the entire thing  oh really hmm well but one thing he is sure is snatching the money from people that have worked  for it and that they deem rich again if you make over 250 000 a year in this country you are considered  rich perhaps in arkansas some other states you're rich i wouldn't doubt that but you can't hold the 
[00:02:00]  same standards for somebody that lives in arkansas as uh you can for someone that lives in los angeles or  new york city 250 000 is two people working their asses off to pay for an apartment food parking  just things like that transportation that is not rich but uh to the people they will bear the brunt  to the people understand that listen to us in the smaller places that it's not a boohoo thing but  250 000 in new york city is certainly not rich you're living it's barely it's barely living well to be 
[00:02:30]  honest with you it's all relative and there isn't a relative taxation there isn't a relative they just  look at people all over the country and say here's the the level where you are considered wealthy no  matter what where you live or anything like that and um some people have no defense because like i'll  just said you know you get the boohoo from everybody else which you know obviously if you're making uh 
[00:03:00]  uh 30 000 a year and struggling like a motherfucker are you gonna look and go i wish i was making 250  if i was i'd gladly pay no you wouldn't first of all no you fucking wouldn't and when it goes up to  the point where the government will be taking more money home than you do uh you'd have a problem with  that and um but i have a giant problem with that and paying for this health care bill that that he's  trying to concoct which is uh pure pure socialism does ron listen to the program yeah i said i don't 
[00:03:30]  mind paying more but i just said in the last week or two i'm i'm even losing faith in obama a 60 40 split  with the government where we pay 60 and the government gets 40 is completely insane yeah it's completely  insane it makes no sense and is this for just is this for new yorkers the 60 40 split oh no no this is  this is uh nationwide this will be the if if uh obama's version of a health care program 
[00:04:00]  is put in place the brunt of of the payment is going to be on the backs of the rich again by the way  remember when he was saying well the taxes because you know the people that are uh hard pressed  we have to help bring them up you know we have to bring them up which for some reason i i don't  know i don't want to bring anyone up go fuck yourself i'm not bringing people up uh so now would  you like to bring a few people up hey i bring people up that uh well i want to bring up no no it's uh 
[00:04:30]  yeah you mentioned that i i mean from from my personal experience i come from a large family  and i got a bunch of people that aren't doing too well yeah and and what's going on with the taxes  and and and what not it makes it harder for me to step up and and help family members because i'm i'm  helping strangers i'm helping strangers you're helping you're right like i i said it a long time 
[00:05:00]  ago all right if you're gonna force us to uh you know hand over 60 60 percent yeah of our earnings  then allow me to choose family members i want to help let me start there at least yeah start there  or even uh uh people working like put it this way i've had uh a lot of work done on my house over the  past year now you can say oh booty hooty who look at me no you know what i'm i'm not looking for  sympathy yeah what i want to put the point i want to put across is i've employed a lot of fucking

[00:09:30]  fucking number i want to hear your point bashing obama i bet what i don't have a right to bash  go fuck yourself he's taxing the shit out of the people that are employing people  so they cannot employ people anymore yay so how does that work i'm reading your shit type it in  how the fuck does that work him uh uh penalizing the people that are employing people 
[00:10:00]  had it yeah he's like robin hood all right uh let me say hi to frank in jersey frank  hey he's got me sick to my son it's not like if i was gonna go away in four years and we're gonna  get this money back once it's gone it's gone so this is what these people that elected him that  were cheering crying when he's elected don't understand yeah exactly once he screws it up it's 
[00:10:30]  done it's not like no matter democrat republican once they come into office it's not like they said  uh let's give this money back to these people so it's done yeah then it's just done the tax goes up  it stays there and you're penalized for achieving the american dream in this country now but all those  people protesting were hillbillies who were just racist against obama right that's what they said  you know when people were protesting tax increases uh they were just uh redneck assholes that uh were 
[00:11:00]  racist the only reason they were protesting is because they were racist and no they're they're  displeased with what's going on with this fucking guy jesus christ just tax the shit out of everybody  and think that's gonna help you know what it's gonna do it's gonna make everyone pull the fuck back  me my spending i'm cutting it back what am i gonna do what am i gonna do now hire hire more people  to work in my house no i'm not fucking hiring i gotta sit back now and see how much i'm gonna have to pay 
[00:11:30]  for some fucking other guy that i don't know who the fuck they are for this socialized health care  and one thing i'd like to say do you think ted fucking kennedy would still be alive if he was  under some socialized health care like canada right do you think that motherfucker would still  be alive bullshit but you don't think he just went to a regular one and had to wait please and had to  wait six months for surgery like they do in canada under the socialized obama health care program  blow me that motherfucker without pudding coming out his ears in a fucking casket he'd be dead 
[00:12:00]  that's wolfgang or whatever his name is if you if you want somebody to come to his town and put all  the money into a pot and everybody makes the same amount of money if they take his salary and give it  and divide it up with everybody that works at the food town and walmart and and everybody makes the  same amount of money that's what the obama nation want ted kennedy would be dead from a brain tumor  if he had to adhere to any type of socialized medicine some type of tax the rich so they could 
[00:12:30]  pay for the poor the government which is uh already now in the automotive industry the banking business  you know they're they're spreading themselves then now they want to run uh health care which is great  because the government's been so good at running everything whenever it's a government agency  never too many people for one job never a bunch of red tape never delays never over cost uh so  them running the country's health care system is just going to be a treat i'm not saying the one we 
[00:13:00]  have in place now is great it sucks a dick the insurance companies need to be spanked uh because  they're just robbing people blind with the cost of premiums for health care i understand that but that  doesn't mean the government again has to step in and snatch everything up and fucking run the show  enough enough already enough fucking taking my goddamn money away and rich doesn't mean you're rich  forever you know you make a lot of money it's really nice but at some point yeah exactly exactly 
[00:13:30]  you know what it is you make a lot of money and it's nice you're able to put it away you're able  to buy some things you're able to like i said employ some people build yourself up that was the american  dream that isn't a fucking crime in this country it's it's what was supposed to happen it's an  opportunity for somebody to step in and and use a little bit of luck some skill uh networking whatever  you want to call it to build themselves up and make something the opportunity not a guarantee the 
[00:14:00]  opportunity to prosper in this country people now think it's a guarantee that they're guaranteed  health care you're not you could die on the side of a fucking dumpster lonely and broke that's part  of it or you can be a very rich man uh uh that uh can take care of his family and other people  it's what this country is there's no fucking guarantees you should debate uh obama how do we 
[00:14:30]  get this done oh please get this done how do we get him on what trade treat him with kid gloves  everybody we could we could uh google bomb never seen i've never seen a fucking president treated with  such kid gloves under such adverse circumstances not so much like this the people are turning a bit  on obama certainly hope uh people are turning on obama a bit it's not socialized medicine oh my god  yes it is von wolfgang why isn't he calling in when people are are paying when when when the wealthy 
[00:15:00]  as they're considered are paying for the masses it is socialized medicine it is like the old  communist method of everybody gets a piece of the pie it doesn't work it doesn't fucking work  i'm a union i'm a union sheet metal worker and i'm in my local so was i it it it funds our own health  care so yeah the people that are working are taking care you know are paying for the people 
[00:15:30]  that are unemployed at the time and you know and it we're always broke the the fund is always broke  we're always dumping more money into that fund yep trying to store i mean obviously union and and  that's what it's all about but it's always broke because we're always trying to take care you know  everybody's paying for the retirees health benefits and one retiree well retirees you should pay for  do we because they carried the load for a long time it's different retirees are different man  retirees are different and it's a different story no they should but one one retiree gets cancer 
[00:16:00]  and he has 400 000 in medical bills and you know what i'm saying so it's it's the same thing that  obama wants on a larger scale if he paid in then that's fine there there there there are people  i do not want to support people that did not pay into the system uh there there's this you know like  um social security you know you pay in and then it gives you the ability when you retire to get uh 
[00:16:30]  some money um whether it's too much too little did not enough whatever that's debatable arguable  um whether it's going broke whatever but it's the concept of you you pay in and you take out i don't  like this some people pay in other people pay nothing but everyone gets the same thing that's called  socialism and it's douchebag here that i'm reading his fuck name every two seconds uh can't understand 
[00:17:00]  that when everyone pays in and then everyone can take out that's different it's not some people  paying in to to care for others and hold them up as obama says i'm not here to hold people up if they  do work for me i pay them that's capitalism that's what our country's based on not socialism which is  what obama is doing he is trying to put across socialist programs by by taking care of people 
[00:17:30]  based on taxing the living fuck out of people that are the only people in this country with the ability  to employ other people so now like i said i pull back i don't employ people now what happens to them  they're not making money unemployment goes up boy that that worked well and we're just getting tax  and spend like every democrat has a fucking stamp tax and spend on his forehead listen uh mike in jersey 
[00:18:00]  my wife and i earned uh 268 000 last year and struggle every month to pay our mortgage car payments  college costs and our luxury quote vacation this year is a trip to the jersey shore yeah it's not it's not  rich uh this is another booty hooty who thing yeah when people go oh poor anthony oh booty hooty who  um i'm not getting a new car anytime soon i used to i used to uh support uh general motors every uh two 
[00:18:30]  or three years based on my lease or or a purchase or something like that i would then go in and uh get a  new vehicle you know why i'm doing well feeling good all right i can afford this um and it's not just  me people don't understand this shit doesn't get pulled out of thin fucking air i don't hand the  money over to god and get a fucking vehicle it's supporting an industry which now i can't support  because i'm being taxed up my fucking asshole so i gotta hold everything back here's the audio that 
[00:19:00]  really uh got you going this morning obama on the today show again the office is saying that we're  going to have higher costs with those bills and a greater deficit people look at that mr president  people who are paying already high costs for medical care and they think it's a joke well  they're paying a lot of money and they see congress coming up with legislation that would cost them  even more well no no but that's i think it's important to to not confuse two issues and that's 
[00:19:30]  out-of-pocket costs for individuals versus the long-term unsustainable costs of health care  uh in under medicare and medicaid and other government programs uh here's what's going on  uh we have a problem of uh health care inflation generally being out of control and that's true  in the private sector and that's true in the public sector and so what we've got to do is we've got to  bend the cost curve over the long term that's that's not that's not unreasonable that wasn't a clip 
[00:20:00]  that's not unreasonable no we got a couple more clips here yeah not all of them have been adopted by  congress yet but again not to to to beat a dead horse here but again the congressional budget  office looking at those bills that are out there and saying they do not contain cost any one of  those bills would you sign them based on what you say right now they're not where they need to be  uh but i i i promise you i just met with the congressional budget office today so i i know exactly what  they're saying and what they're saying is is that the cost savings that are in those bills right now 
[00:20:30]  some of them may actually work but they're not enough to offset the additional costs of bringing  in 46 million new people uh to provide so they won't work well in terms of reform they what they  won't do is offset the fact that if you are adding additional people to the system that's going to cost  more yeah at least she's not at least she's uh she's asking them yes asking them questions and then  finally costing one of the ways to pay for the health care bill is something called a surtax 
[00:21:00]  on the on some of the richest americans people who make more than 280 000 a year i've never heard  whether you support that or don't support that would you support a surtax right now the house has  put forward a surtax the senate finance committee is looking at some other options what i've said is  and i have stuck to this claim i don't want to see additional tax burdens on people making 250  thousand dollars a year or less but and by the way uh despite all the uh hue and cry out there about 
[00:21:30]  how obama's becoming like a tax and spend democrat this is what you hear from yeah that's what i just  said and of course he's going to say no what is he going to say yep that's what i am tax and spend  democrat you got it i got tax and spend democrat this is what you hear from the republicans  the only tax change i've made in the six months since i've been here is to cut people's taxes  shut the fuck shut that off shut the fuck up you're lying you cut taxes on people that don't work 
[00:22:00]  holy shit yeah oh what i've done is cut tax it's it's it's a game of percentages he can say he cut the  taxes on on like 90 of of uh the population meanwhile the 10 is the fucking the one that's  that's uh supporting the the country that's where the tax burden is and 40 of those people never paid  taxes before because they fall on a bracket where they don't have to pay taxes and he gave them a 
[00:22:30]  rebate check so that's his idea of cutting taxes is taxing the fuck out of the people that are  producing and giving it to people that don't pay taxes anyway thank you good job thank you  like a tax and spend democrat this is what you hear from the republicans the only tax change i've made  in the six months since i've been here is to cut people's taxes but would you support a surtax on  those people making more than 280 000 a year to help pay for this health care reform i think that 
[00:23:00]  ultimately what we're going to have is a package which will probably include probably some additional  revenue thank you well to do people well to do well to do he calls them well to do people well to do  what an old lady he sounds like let me let me let me also add add another thing he is a square  to people that nerd to people that love thinking um that i fucking like cigars with hundred dollar bills  and shit like that i am in a fucking career that can end at any moment this radio business is is 
[00:23:30]  fucking shit it's it's a very difficult business uh to to keep yourself in especially the type of radio  we do and with the rules and regulations where they are lousy so so uh if i'm so well thank you  if i'm so well to do you know what though uh next year might not be as well to do i like being able to  have uh my money and know what i can do with it how much i can spend being responsible with the 
[00:24:00]  income i've made from the fruits of my labor uh instead of having to worry that i'm gonna hand  out my money to people that i don't know what the fuck they're doing all right some i do understand  they're falling on hard times whatever whatever the fuck not my responsibility not my fucking problem  you know my taxes you know what i want my taxes to go to nice smooth northern state parkway 
[00:24:30]  i love that northern state parkway is so fucking smooth when i drive on it it's like velvet  that's what i want to fucking pay my taxes for most of the roads suck in this country  they can't even do that right maybe the maybe the one road you drive on most of these that's it  whoa do you like that he didn't say tax he didn't say the word tax he said no additional  revenue for well-to-do people dude it's another he's fucking read between the lines why would this  this uh open honest transparent presidency why would he use a phrase like that when the question 
[00:25:00]  was uh presented to him in will there be a tax and then he fucking puts it he says it like that  he words it in political speech yeah that is supposed to throw you off and think well obviously  he doesn't mean a tax it's additional revenue for the well-to-do well to do let's finish up the clip 
[00:25:30]  here probably include some additional revenue from well-to-do people including me and you who can  afford to pay a little bit more so that working family already i am people who are going to their  job every single day can have a little more security on their health that means yes mr president  it means that that is one option among many but what levels that's going to be at where it's pegged at  you know all those details that's the main option though obviously and that's already leaked out what  it's going to be and so just don't fucking just be honest he goes she goes does that mean yes 
[00:26:00]  i want to keep come on already above 40 anyone that thinks that he's not a really good politician  they all answer questions the same way stop she asked a pretty direct question yep and he wouldn't  just say yes under certain circumstances i would support that nope not the word yes did not come out  of his mouth no uh and can i read some instant feedback please next year tell crybaby millionaire to 
[00:26:30]  save some money then save some that's that's what i want to do and that's what i'm doing and that's  why i'm not employing uh as many people uh you go i'll i'll throw you i'll throw you some phone  numbers i get that guy's info i'll throw you some phone numbers for carpenters and masons and plumbers  and that and you could call them up and tell them that the crybaby millionaire isn't going to be hiring  them and maybe you could throw them a few bucks you motherfucker uh anthony tax those producing what

[00:29:30]  government let's say okay instead of taxing people why don't we get together and say look  you're going to cut your fat there you go like that's what we were just talking about that i got  no problem with that and that's where i'm at joe i got no problem where i'm at i'm not a michael  moore fan but i did watch sicko and i'm sure it was slanted on in some in some direction you think  but but you know what it wasn't a complete work of shit that had no accuracy there were things in  that that you watch and you go you know what they're because a lot of insurance companies who 
[00:30:00]  really are the ones responsible for jacking up the rates because of a lot of lawsuits  are kind of vultures yeah we have in a way turn into a country of of really like who don't give  a fuck about each other and there's a balance between i'm not going to pick a guy up who's a  bum and carry him and really just telling a working class family to go fuck themselves but there has  to be a balance in there somewhere i think i mean you can't you can't choose your station in life when  you're born when you're a child the innocent child and jimmy's right you know you you uh you have to 
[00:30:30]  look at look at these fat cats and look at the weight and look at our government how how  dysfunctional it is and wonder when it's going to stop is it going to implode eventually and  hopefully just like the constitution says when are we going to rise up and say wait a minute  this is this is ridiculous so why are we putting up with this anymore well look at what happened uh  excuse me joe for just for two seconds look at what happened when people did try to rise up and  protest uh the taxes yep they were called racist they were called hillbillies uh out of touch 
[00:31:00]  uh for some reason you're not allowed to uh go out and actually uh voice a negative opinion about the  way the government is spending your money or else you're a fucking uh you're crazy um you know want  to overthrow the government or you're if they're black there's a black president so now you're a racist  uh you you they put you in a position where you can't really rise up it's only because a black  president that's what that's why they were called racist because they had the nerve to question the  policy of a rise of a black president how long do you think it's going to be before we get to a point 
[00:31:30]  where the people aren't going to start questioning each other do you think we're going to get to a  point i'm really interested in what anthony has said but are you do you think we're going to get to a  point where people are actually going to rise up where there's going to be an implosion  where government is going to fail to the point where people say you know what i'm tired of eating  dirt i'm tired of not having health care and and i know the money's there if you watch tv i see these  senators and everyone wearing thousand dollar suits giving themselves raises during you know yeah 
[00:32:00]  during an economic friggin uh earthquake and they give themselves raises they're taking it's like oh  they're going to try to get this bill in before their summer vacation these motherfuckers take a summer  vacation who the hell who who voted on that what what what guy that represents you would you then  vote for uh uh to give him a vacation we're not in a lot of taking some yeah i think we're a lot of 
[00:32:30]  squeeze a weekend these guys squeeze a whole their session will come back yeah they're just gone  and and to take a vacation during when the country is in financial turmoil like this  is is just outrageous it's not a dopey radio show taking a week off to fucking you know right  recharge the batteries uh these guys are supposed to represent us and they are not but i think if we  took a summer vacation our listeners would survive but you know yeah survive they'd be happy well 
[00:33:00]  the citizens of america they you know they need their government in place especially during hard  times it's it's the whole thing is a complete joke that's where it is every one of these politicians  is a joke yeah but you do you it does help to attack back because uh it does help especially  what media is now it's like if you're attacking accurately people do hear it i mean you have to  you have to fucking fire back you have to yeah i realized just last thing i realized you know  our forefathers were the the majority of the forefathers were or wealthy white land over land 
[00:33:30]  slave owners yeah fuck them too okay you know what but the but their their forefathers were  douchebags reasoning for the development of our country was atruistic it was real it was yeah you  know what though and look i of course i love this country but we have to be very honest and realistic  when we look at that i've had enough of the forefathers a lot of them i'm sure are very good  people and a lot of them were really just fucking pricks let's be very honest they weren't out for  the regular guy dude the works are just books rewritten and rewritten and rewritten and 
[00:34:00]  eventually you know some guy who most likely was an asshole slave owner is all of a sudden this hero  and i and i believe that we all know that we know people as they are yeah they're a lot of them were  asshole slave owners you know i i just i feel like instead of labeling things we really should look at  where the source of all these problems is and that's our goddamn piece of shit government  that's part of it too but you have to look at it too like it's really it is easy to blame the  government because they are the quote-unquote machine but you know what the government is not 
[00:34:30]  the one filing the frivolous lawsuit i mean it really is carlin had a brilliant line he was talking  about people in the government he goes that's the best we have to offer garbage in garbage out and you  know what the government really is a reflection it's not these awful people reflecting wonderful  americans we really are self-centered and greedy a lot in a lot of ways but the the the whole thing of  them representing the american people has just turned into something completely different yeah  they do not represent when you look at what your your politicians are doing you cannot figure out who 
[00:35:00]  they're representing it's not the masses like who votes for those that you look at a bill and go  that isn't representing me that isn't representing uh the another guy that's uh working for a living  middle class lower class it's representing that motherfucker that's writing the bill and and  getting him re-elected or getting him more money or getting him favors from another place that has to 
[00:35:30]  stop but one thing is how do you as a politician how do you do it right because like you look at look  at the radio show they're pretty much majority of most of your fans like you say they're all democrats  or republicans half of them hate every bit we do oh exactly half of them love it's almost like how do you  represent people when everybody is so completely even people on your side are so completely fucking  different well that's just that you're i guess you're you're probably trying to represent the  majority of your constituency but from what i see they're not even representing that like you you read 
[00:36:00]  some things that get passed and you go no one would vote for that yeah no one's gonna vote for  more money for my representative oh no one's gonna fucking say i agree with that we got patrice on the  line uh patrice o'neill everyone what's up patrice hi patricky hey good morning my co-star in the new  upcoming film hi patrice well i'm keeping that on the l there buddy you never know so um i call to say 
[00:36:30]  that i agree with anthony thank you sir uh like almost 100 but the problem is it the two things one is that  this is not about money because money they're just printing money they're printing up you know  seven eight seven hundred eighty billion dollars here and there and what they're doing is it's easy  to attack people that the masses uh don't care about or or they they hate which is the rich 
[00:37:00]  but it's just to keep them all focused where this this particular uh government right now is trying to  take over industry they take over the cars uh-huh they're taking over health insurance man  taking over health insurance has nothing to do with money it has something to do with with people  they they trying to clear people out of here man let they try to let you see what's happening  in england and uh uh these countries in canada they the government decides who lives and who dies man 
[00:37:30]  yeah exactly see that thank you you're right but well hold on you're talking about let me ask you  something you're talking about them taking over the industry and rush limbaugh talked about this  to them taking over the banks when someone like gm or some company goes bail us out and they go to  the government with their hat out and they go give us money and the government gives the money and what  they do with it is they wind up bonusing like i think a aig did this they wind up bonusing their  executives and the public goes we want these people shot the government steps in and goes we'll give  you money but now you have to say let me say this though norton they they bonus dictators when they 
[00:38:00]  take over land in other countries they give money see they give money to people that help them out  they give money to dictators who kill their own people and and help them sell their own land to  to the to the government let me let me do the same thing they do to gm when they when these guys helped  them in this takeover they go thanks it's a kickback man they're all in cahoots man patrice let me let me  let me uh throw this in though because uh a lot of people got mad at them bonusing uh some of the 
[00:38:30]  executives in these companies that were bailed out but let me let me put it in terms that i think we  can understand as a show here at sirius uh satellite radio that used to be you know xm uh what if opi  they bonused uh and and and you know the the the satellite industry has gone through some dire  straits financially i don't think it's any secret what if they bonused uh elo uh to keep him here 
[00:39:00]  and and elo is a very good guy man very good for the job but he was offered a better job a higher  paying job with more security right now they were saying they're bonusing some of these executives  because they're going to fucking leave and leave a void of of management whether it's good or bad i have  no idea but this void of management uh that that they can't afford to just lose and have to  find new guys uh i would rather them have paid elo more money sure and giving him job security to keep 
[00:39:30]  him here we also know that most of uh the management in the radio industry they're they're  shit but i mean that that though was was that was their excuse right i understand because i don't  know if it was i don't know if they're going to lose some some very important people i don't know  the industry enough to know whether it's a good or bad we could talk for the radio world but yeah  that would have been good i would love to see half of management be you know kicked out the door in 
[00:40:00]  their big salaries especially bring in radio right place exactly but especially at the old place that's  not simple that's not simple enough for what's going on the reason they would it's easy it's it's the  robin hood thing you need the the well the the masses you need a majority of the people to support  what you do and to support taking over the industry what what they did is they go we're going to get 
[00:40:30]  these rich assholes so that the people that's walking around that really don't look further into what's  happening go good and they just look at it like robbing from the rich to help everyone this people  are saying socialism man but this is close to something else i i get nervous to say it publicly  but it ain't just but the dude the whole planet was it the whole the whole planet was in a like an  economic the economic toilet and what happens is a gm really was or all these other places we're going 
[00:41:00]  we're in deep financial trouble factors are closing people getting laid off the reality is it was  happening but is the answer a government then taking over and owning a majority share in this  company what's the option though the option is you let them fold and then another industry comes from  that vacuum then people can't complain okay fair enough but then you then people who are auto workers  who can't complain that all of a sudden 50,000 of them are out of work and have let them talk to 
[00:41:30]  their union delegate and say why am i out of a fucking job now well because you demanded fucking  ninety dollars an hour uh to stand and work a fucking spot welding machine and uh you're  if they said to you this is i mean eighty percent i'm just making up a number but how many people  do you think would think the economy was better if someone told them it was if they got on the news  and said the economy is better most people would spend money because they were told that you know 
[00:42:00]  you're right yeah he's right yeah no no believe me i know how stupid people are and they're sheep  and uh you're absolutely right and and to to panic on the news sells a lot better so to make it seem  like oh my god we're on the brink of disaster uh yeah there there's a worldwide financial trouble  um but uh you know things things are actually starting to bottom out as they say turn around  and i think we're not seeing the the same uh uh uh the news really pounding the fact home that oh my god 
[00:42:30]  we're in dire straits and people are kind of spending a little more money and after the use of the unions  and look the unions overextend sometimes yeah but the unions argument would be look we have taken pay cuts  they have at times taken pay cuts and the bond with and what they say is who is telling executives  to take pay cuts nobody so here the union takes a certain hit oh and then meanwhile these scumbag  executives are bonusing each other so then the government steps in and goes if you want more  of our money you're not gonna bonus well then let me uh answer that one then the same thing it 
[00:43:00]  doesn't matter if it's the executives or the workers and their union uh too much money goes out  the government doesn't step in and the company fucking folds and then another company comes out  of it that goes all right we can do this cheaper and better and here so let's fucking do it this  way and perhaps they should be given tax breaks and yeah but instead you're right and over industries  yeah one by one yeah but instead of letting right instead of letting the company fold and then letting 
[00:43:30]  the private sector business step in and fill that void with another company employing people starting  from scratch uh the government steps in and and owns the company well that's insanity the government  didn't do it by force anthony there will there's a the void is because look let's say that they let  that happen that happens yeah and some other guy has a better product but as long as they're telling  everybody all right that you have no money they're telling us that we have no money all they got to do 
[00:44:00]  is now take over whatever the industry they want to and then go hey we got money that's it it's completely  acceptable now you're right it's completely acceptable now the government has made it where  people don't get surprised that they now are owning private fucking companies but the government's not  running the company the government's not running in and taking over these things people are going to  them begging for money but it's like giving it to them they people companies have begged for 
[00:44:30]  government bailout money for years look at uh chrysler years ago when iacocca was in charge he went to  the government the government gave him money he paid the government back with interest or it was a loan  that this government is coming in and actually taking part ownership but didn't in the company  didn't they give money to like i think it was a a uh aig yeah they gave money to aig and what aig did  was the amount of money that those motherfuckers bonus and i mean i understand keeping a guy like  elo you're right but it was disgusting and the people were like what are you doing so then the 
[00:45:00]  government's like okay well if you want more money this is how it has to be because you cannot be  trusted to behave honorably there's a balance here the government is is not i don't want them  running everything you're giving them a lot more credit as being just the well we were put in this  position where we had to do this it's a very calculated move based on opportunity there was  an opportunity that they saw and went like wow we can we can start scooping up these companies  and the government running um a publicly traded company is crazy the plan for all of this 
[00:45:30]  is sticking it to people with money like that's the front right right right that's that we're gonna  get you rich people right and everyone can get behind that oh yay but now when you get this public  health care look our care system is is is an unfair system too but what it does is it allows you to  live if you have the ability to live a government control health care system makes let's date they 
[00:46:00]  are they equate whether you're worth keeping alive if there's some indian kid that's born with another  kid attached at the asshole they don't fly to uh you know uh uh romania to get him cut in half they  always wind up coming to the united states heart problems they come to the united states a child has  a brain tumor they come to the united states you know why we have very good health care here if  you can afford it um and uh there are varying levels of health care and you are guaranteed uh the 
[00:46:30]  right to uh health care in an emergency room in those circumstances if you go in uh it's not  really man it's not gonna be free uh you might but i mean i i used to think hey you know you know  my mind moved moved moved to a different point of view man and it's and it's not because i give a  shit about rich people's pockets it's it's the government controlling everything is bugs me this 
[00:47:00]  is not they're printing fake money money means nothing you think five percent of somebody's shitty  three hundred thousand dollars helps so it's just taking over man anyway yeah right on patrice  hey thanks for calling man great phone call patrice and neil everyone yeah but it's it's also it's  like this we we have this thing to look at the government like it's this uh this brilliant calculating  uh organism and at times yeah maybe it's sneaky and shitty but the bottom line is certain members 
[00:47:30]  of society have been proven that left to their own devices they behave like absolute scumbags and they  they don't honor what they said they were going to honor right and they become pieces of  shit and it's like people who have no health care i don't want to see people who are broke left out  in the cold with nothing i don't want i'm not a socialist but i also don't want to see what  especially when i see all this money being wasted in the war i see all this money being wasted yeah  so the system has to be fixed i don't want to see some one taking their kid to the emergency  room or someone just going for regular checkups that can't get it because they have no money well 
[00:48:00]  then go for the fucking hard fix and and fix the actual problem instead of the easy fix which is  pit everybody against this evil well to do and tax the fuck out of them again and patrice is saying  you know uh the government printing up money they're doing that so could i ask them could you just print  up the share that i'm supposed to give in and just and just print that just throw it in the pot so i  don't have to fucking give it in and uh somebody i'm reading down here in uh uh the feedback uh basic 
[00:48:30]  health health care is a basic human right uh and i was saying that if you can afford it it it's it's not  a a a right of this country there is no right to health care i'm sorry and there's no right that says  that people that make a certain amount of money have to pay for people's health care i'm sorry i think  and like i said before by employing people by spending my money and employing people they can 
[00:49:00]  then have a better chance at affording uh health insurance i'd rather do it that way i'm getting  something out of it i'm getting a a worker that is coming to my house performing a service i then pay  him money he can then use that money to support his family to pay his health care and do other things  and then other people that can pay for employees do the same and uh you get enough of that going on 
[00:49:30]  it's called capitalism and that's a very good point you're making because i think a lot of people are  focused on the fact that you're doing a boohoo today of course me not not the case but not the  fucking that is a very very important point right there i've reached a point in my life where i  employ people and i i i give people money in exchange for services i don't give people money  for fucking charity although i do at times uh of my choosing and what i deem uh uh worthy of my 
[00:50:00]  charity let me read a couple of instant feedbacks i'm making uh i make 90 000 a year driving a truck i  pay 35 000 in taxes this is something that is lost in this whole discussion by the way it's not just over  250 000 being raped by the government see in his world he makes 90 he's paying 35 right that's  killing him that's a huge percentage that's killing him that's over 40 of his money huge  percentage and now we're up to a point where if you're making over 250 000 you're now giving 
[00:50:30]  a 60 40 split with the government you're gonna be where you pay the 60. the problem is the money they  have they're wasting because they're wasting it this is that for many many many many many  but it's like we get mad at poor people like who want health care who really aren't  leeches or pieces of shit it's almost like we have now focused on them and go fuck them they're  leeches but a lot of them really just can't afford it it's it's like the problem the focus should be  on the on the fucking mismanagement of money the government already does have not the people who 
[00:51:00]  need the government failed those people a long fucking time let me tell you another thing though  time ago just like just like there is waste in the government and just like the insurance companies  uh um i like to uh pretty much extort money out of people and just like the lawyers like to uh uh  grab onto these lawsuits that make it so the insurance companies now have to charge a lot  of money because they're being sued every fucking minute by these shyster lawyers members of the  public yeah there are also people that are uh uh not don't have health insurance because they're 
[00:51:30]  fucking living beyond their means of course they're living beyond their fucking means i saw um a video  yesterday of a grocery store in detroit at the first of the month when the uh food stamps come in  and holy mother of fuck these people came in complaining that they can't feed their kids  one woman had i believe six children and she said i can't feed my children and uh and she she goes 
[00:52:00]  a lot i don't she goes i don't eat so i could feed my children this woman was two fucking 30 she  had to be 230 fucking pounds with six kids you don't eat and then there was another one with these  giant earrings and very nice fitting yellow uh suit jacket and there she is with a pile of groceries in  the fucking cart and on the government till that and bitching about that is annoying that's annoying 
[00:52:30]  it's fucking annoying but look at what happens when the government gave money to these companies  and the amount of money that they that they fucking just handed out to people who didn't  deserve it to people who are fucking armani dude she's wearing an armani shirt it's probably a boot  leg whatever you know something it puts across a bad image you're right and she said she isn't  eating because her kids eat look at her it's annoying get out of here but she look at this fat  fuck she's not the problem she's annoying and she's a problem part of the problem but she's not 
[00:53:00]  part of the problem part of it but not the main part of it i don't want to pay for that i i agree  but i don't want to pay for fucking i don't want to see the government giving money to a company who is  bonusing these fucking scumbags who refuse to give the money back who the company takes a bath and these  bags of shit are still getting bonus can we see how management works they never fire each other  that is a huge problem and it's a much bigger problem than that fucking dumb i don't know if  it's much bigger i think so it's huge but that is also huge i'll get to the part where the guy with 
[00:53:30]  the fucking two hundred dollar sneakers is asking the cameraman for fucking money that guy it's just  it's a hoot it's a hoot you don't get penalized for being irresponsible in this country no you're  allowed to have as many kids as you want and then we have to fuck you know we have to and then we have  to pay for your kids stop somewhere along the line seven eight right somewhere along the line  you have to take responsibility for for your situation it's un-fucking-believable michael  jordan's on food stamps and he doesn't even look good anymore this guy michael jordan here he is 
[00:54:00]  listen to this guy how long do they last you should i say out of a month about three weeks  what do you do that last week we got in the months we gotta eat these noodles  i'm gonna get a lot of noodles you gotta get a lot of noodles so the beginning of the month is meat  the end of the month is noodles yep every month is like that look at that shitload of bacon in the  front of that fucking cart is it worse now than it used to be dude i can buy whatever i want at the 
[00:54:30]  grocery store i've never had a shopping cart that full of my life that's i swear to god that is  like holy wow that's irresponsibility right there that's exactly what i was thinking and and the  comments on the video i was reading is like i have never had a shopping cart that's full in my life  i went shopping yesterday it was maybe a quarter of a shopping cart but because there's fucking like  that six seven eight kids a clip to these families yeah they run out of fucking uh money and food you're 
[00:55:00]  being irresponsible you're living beyond your means by having too many and i'm i'm with you  where you say you know that some people are down their luck and those people should be helped but  then there's the the other side of this where this is ridiculous yeah why do we have to bring these  people up that aren't even uh responsible i don't want to what's going on in their lives a couple more  instant feedbacks greg and tony and uh hop hog oh yeah i make 42 000 on long island uh his 60 40 makes  me not want to make 250 000 yeah right so here's another side of this so there's people coming up 
[00:55:30]  they're like why bother well why would i want to make more money if i'm just going to get taxed on it  and that that is an exact uh a problem that happened in the soviet union there was no incentive there has  to be an incentive to succeed in this country for uh a continued success incentive is very  continued success i realized i said that right when i said it incentive is very very important  incentive that's a very very important you don't want to be villainized you don't want to be uh 
[00:56:00]  penalized by by becoming what this country it was built on and and it takes away the ambition  of people to want to get to that point carolina man south carolina hope i hate to say it but it's  true and it's right i voted as you did i didn't vote by the way i i have no problem saying that because  i believe in the george carlin line about uh what was it again i'm dead i'm part of the  i the the shit i he's saying i don't vote he goes uh because he goes you didn't vote you have no  right to because i do have the right to complain because i'm not part of the problem i didn't 
[00:56:30]  contribute to it yeah there you go although i love carlin but i didn't vote because i'm lazy  that's why i didn't vote is that the reason you of course it is we haven't we do it took i  do have a civic responsibility to vote i firmly believe that i just think it's the same  shit every four years to be honest with you it is we should vote independently more or less more or  less uh i voted as you did and now is my wife and i are about to be considered rich quotation marks go  figure we were house shopping and car shopping but not anymore yeah that's what it is i i i think 
[00:57:00]  you're talking more for the people today that are are below you for real people don't understand that  i mean you're frustrated and and you should be but in the end you're going to be okay but but what  you're making a very good yeah you're making a very good point uh for the people definitely below  you that that's where it's going to really you know you're going to see that's who gets affected  and people don't realize this and i said this dude i was saying this before the election people don't  understand that this these well-to-do that obama is talking about are going to hold back money to see 
[00:57:30]  how badly they're going to be raped and they are the ones paying people i i'm not talking about  goods uh dropping out of the sky and landing in my driveway in my backyard shit like that  i pay for this i employ people i don't fucking put the shit in myself and even if i did i'd be paying  people at like home depot and lowe's and things like that it makes jobs yeah let's go to andrew in 
[00:58:00]  brooklyn the andrews space shuttle endeavor oh andrew what's up andrew something i gotta quickly  something i gotta quickly tell you about the um health care um nationalized health care you know  in some of these countries of nationalized health care they actually banned from getting  sharing life um saving medications they're actually banned from it so you're actually for  health care being nationalized no no what do you what do you think should happen it's not a good endeavor 
[00:58:30]  um keep up here where it is um i don't want to nationalize i'm fine with it well there's a  balance andrew i think there's a balance again i keep saying that dumb word but it's like we're  just a bunch of extreme asses as americans it's like i don't want a nationalized system where i have  to go to the government to get my fucking tonsils looked at but i also i don't like the fact that all  the money we waste for giving foreign debt and handing it over to fucking people who vote the way we  think they should vote another country they should be that's where the money should come from that's 
[00:59:00]  so obvious to a lot of people but for some reason they just look look the other way as far as all  that stuff they try to take it from people right they can find money if they you know if they really  wanted to andrew me andrew can i can ask you something because i i don't know right yeah andrew can i  ask you something it's a little off topic but i just need to know real quick i don't know which even  shuttle is up that which shuttle is up at the station right now um and never basically that's 
[00:59:30]  it which one which one this uh that's it i didn't hear you which which okay later he doesn't fall for  it anymore he doesn't he doesn't want to deal with that never never basically he actually wants to  have like normal discussions i know all we want to hear is say why don't we let him have a normal  special number he's been married six months delayed diagnosis here's a spot that's running  it's a canadian woman talking about uh uh nationalized health care in canada she had a brain tumor 
[01:00:00]  she was on a six-month waiting list she had to come down to the united states and have it operated on  and she she said she would have been dead she would have been dead it's like ted kennedy would have been  dead uh a lot of these people have to wait but anthony that's just one isolated case well of course it is  all right yeah the thing is we got a guy coming in actually that's going to debate anthony and mr  canada is just shaking we got a guy that's coming in that's going to debate anthony on um on health  care well can we just name dr carol just play the tape from this morning and i'll just go home and  he could debate the tape but wait something like that like people having to wait for health care 
[01:00:30]  if you if you're paying into it you have your own health care why would everybody be be forced to  do that like i don't mind that if that's the option for somebody who has no health care at all  i'm for i'm for that i i don't want the entire system change but people who can't afford it that's  the problem i have there is uh uh something in the bill that does call for uh the elimination of  you being able to actually pay for your own health care and obama obama said obama said i i don't know 
[01:01:00]  all the ins and outs of the bill um which is really kind of frightening but um yeah that would  never go through i understand that anthony joe silver in jersey makes a very good point even  though i've never seen the instant feedback hotter or the phones ring more oh my god he writes uh  because he knows go back to talking about tits and internet videos anthony going off on his fascist uh  rants are the worst part of the show thank you by the way thank you i take that as a compliment  and then he goes and then he goes guest on glenn beck or some shit like that if you want to 
[01:01:30]  bitch as everybody is calling because this does affect it's everybody everybody let's say hi to  jose in queens jose people hey what's up guys hey jose listen uh i want to touch back on what anthony  was saying about the grocery shopping yeah now i go i work every day i install elevators in the city  and i bust my ass yeah that industry's up and down 
[01:02:00]  actually it's pretty god god i like it for the way you meant it  plummeted down the elevator  you work your ass off you're in the elevator industry what's up  all right i got three kids to feed i work i do what i have to do i go grocery shopping now this is  during the winter time and this pisses me off every time i think about it i'm in the supermarket  this lady pulls up she's got two fucking shopping carts part to the guild so she's got four kids and 
[01:02:30]  she's pregnant and she pulls out a fucking wick card i wanted to ask tell her you should say thank  you to me and every other hard-working guy in the fucking city you know yeah a lot of people get  infuriated by that there's an there's an overindulgence that happens that i just don't  understand i was i was brought up legitimately poor i mean i've told a bunch of the stories on  the air and i'm one of seven kids not one of us was overweight because we couldn't afford to eat 
[01:03:00]  a little rail i was like the kid that had the shit that kid that if everybody was done learning  it right and now i got it you know what i mean and we were just we were just above like the whole uh  you know food stamp thing just above we would have been better off if we were poor exactly  my mother so my dad and my mom should just said you know what fuck it we're not working anymore  because because we could probably raise you better if we're poor if we're just poor my mother did the  same thing raised three kids uh single mom and uh you know we we always had a roof over our head 
[01:03:30]  that she worked her ass off and uh always had food things like that and it was big you know because  she fucking went out and worked like two jobs and and knew what she had to do knew her responsibility  there is a point where you have to take responsibility for you for what's going on  i understand the high i mean we we went through uh stages where we weren't sure if we're going to  have electricity the next month and we weren't sure if we're going to have a you know enough food to  eat for real and then my dad would hit because he was kind of like an entrepreneur and then he would 
[01:04:00]  do well and then we were we did okay for a while and then the money would trickle out and then next  thing you know we're wondering you know what what what bills weren't going to be paid and how that was  going to affect us i i want to read another thing from uh this idiot uh uh there's a lot of little  companies that are staying alive from the obama money what lemonade stands because the little  companies i am a little company idiot do you realize i'm a small business i'm a small business 
[01:04:30]  small business and we we we have a business together too yes and with that we do and and we employ people  and i just told you something you say there's a lot of little companies staying alive from the  obama money well let me tell you something i'm not spending money hiring people now so in order to  keep my company alive i've had to pull back and not spend as much money on workers so how is that helping  that guy's company that guy's little company his carpentry company his woodworking company uh masonry 
[01:05:00]  plumbing how is that helping how is obama's plan helping those companies by me and other people like  me not paying them and not hiring them you're talking out your uh and brad in minneapolis uh he  writes boring how about you play some commercials attaboy brad wow people want to hear commercials  does this look boring do i have to do i have to tweet the phones and the stack of info feedback i'll 
[01:05:30]  never get to you're gonna get one or two people that just have to tweak this they're just fucking  jerking off all day long like monkeys just sitting there jerking off we're talking about a tit why  didn't that by the way it's a very small i think he did i don't know if he tried i saw his name up  they can't get in i know i gotta keep hanging up on people get his number i've been hanging up on  people and then people take their place immediately by the way that's that's uh a small percentage of  the people i don't want to misrepresent most people are are way in as far as what we're discussing right 
[01:06:00]  now uh keith in jersey uh niger paul excuse me he writes oh well time to walk my dog this is  shit let me say hi to mike in uh where are you mike mike mike mike good morning boys i'm up in  haverhill mass and you know what drives me insane is the amount of money and the amount of housing we  have in haverhill mass i drive through those places where they're giant and every one of them has  friggin escalades and mercedes yeah and four fuckin kids and i work my ass making 45 000 a year 
[01:06:30]  and these guys killing me with their fuckin gold rings and their jewelry and their escalade  all right we gotcha houses and money and this shit happens where's the overseer in that shit yeah well  oh fuck all right boys i'm out this just drives me insane that's a good description of haverhill  all right well i mean yeah phones are just lit but i guess we gotta take a break we continue and 
[01:07:00]  and doug from charleston i just saw that highlighted it it is true let me go to it then yeah uh go ahead  hi doug what's up man hey how's it going hi i saw you know the reason why uh why there is a summer  break is because senators and the house people were supposed to have fucking jobs that's how the  country was oh you know something yeah wait what happened that is true that they were supposed to  like take care of their farms and their crops right crops and shit like that wouldn't it be pretty much 
[01:07:30]  when you're bringing in the crops yeah yeah yeah so they take their break so when so when the world  developed or the country developed they ignore the fact they don't need to take that time off  anymore exactly brilliant exactly who wouldn't do that though and originally the senate was supposed  to be appointed by the by the state so that way you would have a direct state representation yeah you  just don't know basically we have two houses it's all crap yeah you're right yeah but uh i like i like  your point though where in the constitution does it say we need to take care of uh yeah it doesn't 
[01:08:00]  it doesn't say it anywhere i mean this whole feel good attitude that jimmy got i mean that's okay  there's not hold on it's not a feel good attitude that jimmy got it's not about that it's about it's  about i don't like to see the money just wasted and i'm not believe me i'm not a particularly dude i'm  not a particularly liberal guy but i don't like seeing money wasted i just don't like seeing people  who can't afford to get taken care of and meanwhile i see our government forgiving foreign debt and giving 
[01:08:30]  money to other countries because they make a decision to do something that we ask them to  do foreign policy you know what i mean that's sick and jimmy's right people that need like help  like make it in this country i grew up in a podunk place in west virginia i joined the navy put myself  through college and now i'm doing well there you go i do it i'm fair enough cry to me they can kiss  my head just started that but there's a balance between okay well then so you so you joined a  fucking organization where you're probably gonna have to go you could possibly have to go and fight  to the death for people and then you go fuck them i mean it doesn't make sense that attitude 
[01:09:00]  dude it doesn't make sense look i'm not saying it's a easy road but i'm saying it's a real people  right right i mean and we're already helping bring people up now it gets to the point where  once again there's a possibility that there's gonna be a 60-40 split with the government yeah  and we pay the six to bring people up again we're already bringing people i know that was the whole  selling point so then you have to go to where jimmy's at and where i'm at and you got to start  looking at where all this money's going and how to how to bring some of that money back and use it 
[01:09:30]  for something else where's the next time where's the next time they're going to dig into our pocket  too oh think about it this should have never got this time but how about the navy guy how about  people coming back from desert storm soldiers who weren't getting proper medical care that's  bullshit i mean i mean but you know as far as i mean as far as the va goes you know i'm i'm on board  right right i'm i'm completely no more to take care of them but they put in no no no no you're not  now what i'm saying is do what i'm saying is even they weren't taken care of like it's gotten so  despicable in this country even the veterans guys who are fighting weren't taken care of it's 
[01:10:00]  fucking despicable the money we give is being wasted i don't want to give any more i pay enough in taxes  the thing is and i understand what he was saying though is and i keep reiterating this this country  is the land of opportunity not guarantees and and there's this sense of entitlement uh that people have  that that they actually believe that it is in because the people is dummies that have no idea  what this country is is founded on is built on what the constitution is what is in it and actually 
[01:10:30]  believe that there is a right to to health care and to that and if they don't have it that it should  be supplied to them by the government which in fact is us it's the tax-paying people it's not in there  but how come we're not as mad at money being wasted and again i know but we are money being  wasted on the war i think we are we are but what do you do about it there's nothing you can do about  it you can't rise up and do we're getting done in this country you can though you can't just sit 
[01:11:00]  there and we can't do anything we can either vote or complain about it i mean you have to talk about  it exactly we're not just units i see the same happening year after year after year and we're voting  and yelling and screaming but we need to vote for a third party they probably laugh at us  when we try to rise up they laugh at us at you i'll go oh that's cute what sir i think the problem is  we establish a precedent you know with welfare and other stuff that's not the problem you're  taking care of that's a different kind of good social experiment welfare is that name one person 
[01:11:30]  that comes out of welfare and thanks welfare for where they're at today there are there are you're  right welfare the welfare system is is not a good system but i'm not talking about hey let's just keep  uh giving people money people who have oh it's coming back too by the way welfare they're uh raising  that up for the first time in and probably i think well like you said let the companies close hey let  gm fold and then all those people and look what are they gonna what is a guy who's like spent the last  10 years working hard right and being a fair a fucking honest tax-paying guy these companies just shut 
[01:12:00]  down a company like gm that employs that many people right where are all there are very little jobs so i  guess all of those people are supposed to sit around and go what we have to wait till something  else crops up we're gonna crop up more japanese companies who are doing the labor for shit are  just gonna have the it's like well you get general motors who by the way a lot of these companies  during the war were able to turn around in no time and retool their plants to make fucking tanks  which is amazing to me sure they're making cars all of a sudden they're making tanks that was the 
[01:12:30]  go get them spirit right uh how about you turn around and you turn your company uh into a uh  wind turbine fucking manufacturing plant things like that something that uh actually has a need  fills that void that was left uh when the company folded uh builds a city back up with industry  shit like that because all those contracts have probably been given out like all the  first of all we don't use tanks like we used to it's mostly i was just making a point that right  can be done it can you can turn a company around uh you know a general motors wasn't um 
[01:13:00]  making a lot of cars at that point they turned around and were there for for uh uh the military  but the i'm sorry but the labor force it's hard with labor force because a lot of jobs are lost  because of computers and technology things that really have nothing to do with people  you know a computer can do what 500 people can do it's what do you do for the labor force is just  lost it's like it's easy to go well fuck them they have to find something else but it does hurt the  economy it does hurt us as a country with guys who work for 10 years on an auto line who are great at 
[01:13:30]  that so what do they do if the company just fucking falls apart but the government isn't  fostering these new uh industries and new companies to come up and and you know give  them the tax breaks so they can build these plants and retool uh uh these plants of of of  outdated products uh and and then uh you know you got a city like detroit that is just  fucked now the auto industry has been the backbone of detroit for i mean as long as anyone could 
[01:14:00]  remember sure uh that i that's over that's over so now figure out what else to do don't just sit  there and put your hand out and i'm not talking about the people i'm talking about the companies  don't just sit there and put your fucking hand out think have an executive that comes up with a  fucking idea that goes we need to now do this you make enough money it's a drastic change let's do  this then we can hire people bring back a city with a brand new industry but the executives were there 
[01:14:30]  and they didn't do that exactly you're right the executives paid each other big bonuses and watch  people losing their jobs and some of those people you see on on food stamps are fucking leeches and  other ones you know what are probably ex-auto workers or people who didn't work oh yeah well that's  what yeah but anthony was making that generalizing everybody you know what i'm saying it's like  that's what's frustrating it's like and i'm not saying man the rich people are terrible but it's  like i after watching what's happened in the last year the headline is disgusting the headline is  enough is enough i mean you know you understand you got to help some people if you're in a position 
[01:15:00]  where you're making a lot of money and doing very well i understand that i'm fuck out of my pocket  it's like enough we're we're to the point today enough is enough that's it i feel that way  the 60 40 split is so ridiculous you're right but i feel that way but the bonuses that were  paid out all this money was given to these companies and these scumbags just gave it to  each other there are no difference in radio executives or anything else we gave them  fucking millions of dollars of our money well the one we look at we can play oh look at that 
[01:15:30]  bitch she's got too much bling on but the bottom line is that fucking bitch is it isn't taking 75  million dollars in bonuses in a company that went into the toilet and begged for government money but  there's 75 you know it's 75 million of uh her it's the same person though but that to me she's  fucking person it's the same person it's people that take advantage take advantage of the situation  advantage is one she was taking advantage that was ridiculous but she's not a fucking predator 
[01:16:00]  like these fucking guys who are who know the way the system works and are milking the system on  purpose for millions of dollars and they're taking advantage of of of what's being handed to them as  well yeah but i i don't look at somebody on welfare the same way as i do somebody that  fucking got paid 40 million extra dollars in a company that is begging the government for more  it makes me fucking let's go let's go to mike mike multi-faceted problem yeah how you doing guys  hi mike listen i'm an intern at a at a hospital in the south bronx one of the poorest congressional 
[01:16:30]  districts in the country and jimmy i i'm a big fan of yours pal you're definitely on target with  some things but anthony's 100 right you have to go into these uh poorer so-called poorer neighborhoods  i mean people are wearing rolex watches driving escalators you're not not no i'm not disagreeing  with that i don't think i'm not some flaming liberal who thinks poor people are just victims i'm not talking  about disgusting abuses of the system like that i'm not talking about that but there's abuses of the 
[01:17:00]  system more outweigh uh the likelihood of people getting appropriate benefits i i have 14 year old  kids that are pregnant i i have a woman uh that's actually on her 12th child and she's in her late  30s that's terrible that's disgusting amazing how am i wrong about anything i'm not saying that that's  right that's sickening but jim can you just just let me uh also explain that this welfare and  welfare and welfare i'm writing prescriptions for tylenol because people don't want to pay 
[01:17:30]  3.95 for a bottle of title hanger tax that's what i'll pay a hanger tax so all right so what's the  answer then dude slow down i just want to say what's the answer so used to getting things for free  it is expected now what what is yes you know what i believe i don't disagree with you point i do too  however there are other people on the flip side that are used to getting 30 extra million dollars  a year and then when the company goes in the toilet they still want 30 extra million dollars 
[01:18:00]  and those people lately hold on dude dude hold on i i am more frustrated with them as of late because  i think that the people who want you to write a prescription for tylenol who leech off the system  are irritating and annoying but the people who are taking 30 million extra dollars those are the  people i like to see attacked with rifle butts what do you suggest what do you suggest what do you  suggest can i ask you one question no i would like to know what you suggest why was that money  given without restriction how come how come you're able to restrict cigarettes to eleven dollars a pack 
[01:18:30]  and you're handing money out in buckets to these executives what do you mean the government why  why was it given out like that exactly without restriction as far as uh they were able to give  uh 30 million right or it's one individual and i want to ask you one other thing hold on can i answer  one of the times that you're on a roll one of the time i think the reason that was done is because  there's a flaw in the system and i think what happens is if the government steps in and says we're 
[01:19:00]  going to give you money and this is how you use it then the government is accused of overly interfering  so what happens is they give the money the company gives bonuses which outrage everybody and then we  find out they gave out more and then they come back and ask for more money and then the government  said we'll give you more money but we have to dictate how you spend it so it's like what's the  proper way to do that let me ask you one other question why just answer that one interrupting i'm  sorry to keep interrupting what about tort reform how about if it i agree performs an illegal 
[01:19:30]  operation is charged criminally instead of civil penalty being awarded i agree with both i think  the tort reform is absolutely needed i think people have to have the right to sue but i think  tort reform is certainly needed you're not going to get me siding with a bunch of lawyers who are just  kicking sand in each other's face and i think tort reform is absolutely needed but that's not the entire  problem but change just just let us remember the first george bush wanted to put a cap on on uh lawsuits  medical malpractice lawsuits about 15 20 years ago sure so this has been a problem since then 
[01:20:00]  and this rushing through of this health care plan by obama is nothing but a used car salesman's trick  but let's get it quick but how am i wrong dude i'm not saying i'm not saying that i want that to  happen you think i don't want more of my money taken i don't want more of my money taken dude we're not  on opposite ends of the spectrum here we're talking about the same thing jimmy's talking about one  problem we're talking about another but it's all part of the same giant fucking sucking vacuum 
[01:20:30]  of money problem that we have in this country if they take 40 of my money whatever they take  30 i would rather i don't think i pay 60 but whatever they take if i could choose i would  rather see if they're going to take it i would rather see people at least be able to go to the  doctor then have it fucking go into a government that is giving it to a company that's just going to  both executives or just let me tell you something just let me tell you something people can go to a  doctor now the emergency room will not turn your way now exactly also emphasize that ambulances 
[01:21:00]  ambulances they're called buses in the business are used as taxi services no shit yep me as an  individual if i would if i would need an ambulance i would have to pay about seven hundred dollars out  of pocket okay fair enough i'm not talking about abuses in the system then you have to punish abuses in  the system but because there's abuses in the system it doesn't mean that most people who  probably wouldn't abuse the system shouldn't be taken care of it's like saying there's abuses in  the legal system so you can't have jails it's like just because there's abuse 
[01:21:30]  what i want to ask you one more question yes you keep i keep answering every question you ask  okay okay i just want to ask you one question are you do you think that we immediately need this  health care reform or that if we fix some of the things that are wrong with the current health care  situation i will be okay i i don't know i don't think we need the reform that obama's but believe  me i don't think a tax and spend liberal democrat is the answer for our health care problems but i  also think that the health care system has been the way it is for so long and they're really you know 
[01:22:00]  what there's more people that i'm comfortable with not being covered i'm sorry it annoys me when  i see so much money you can't ask me a question and then keep jumping in you can't ask me a question  i'm answering your question sir i'm sorry that's okay i'm going to listen to you it's all right  i think that there's more people um i think there's more people uh more people uh that i'm  comfortable with not being covered all right we're on the same page my friend and i tell you what 
[01:22:30]  how'd you say i was 100 wrong you said i was 100 wrong if we're if we stop the frivolous lawsuits  health care part of it yes i agree that part of it is frivolous lawsuits jack up the insurance  rates and greed motivate frivolous well i understand that it's kind of a circular problem  but it's not just tort reform i i wanted to uh address something with uh james uh where you're  talking about you know you want to see people be able to get health care and and uh if preventative  medicine yes there's a family that uh you know you want the kids to be able to go to a pediatrician 
[01:23:00]  things like that that that is the health care system we have now uh like that's your idea of what  it's like the the one he wants to put forth isn't going to be that easy for people to just go  there's going to be an overwhelming amount of people the waiting list is going to be ridiculous  it's not going to be like it is now where all right we pay this money but at least little johnny  is going to go in the waiting room and the doctor's going to be like a little 
[01:23:30]  fucking norman rockwell picture it's going to be this fucking a whole different animal the way  medicine works the way uh people are taking care of uh it's gonna it's going to be completely  different so it's not that easy of a fix of just you know let's reform a few things and and everyone  will have the health care that you are afforded and and i am and and a lot of other people in this  country uh for for a grave fucking price uh but it's going to be a whole new animal look i went without 
[01:24:00]  it for 10 years so i know what it's like to have health care i went for many many many years i mean  i went to my 30 right now i've been half my life yeah you know what i might have been close to half  my life exactly so i i went a long time without health care and i know people don't have it and  it sucks if you get sick it sucks if you if you need a fucking a tooth out or if you need a  fucking i put a drill screw in an abscess gum once a drill screw because the insurance companies and  this is what sicko points out and and he's right this is where michael moore was right is that a lot of 
[01:24:30]  people who work for the insurance companies their job is to turn you down their job is to find a  reason to not honor the insurance you have so they don't have to pay for procedures that they don't  deem absolutely necessary so here it is in good faith you you work a job you pay into the system  premiums and these fucking vultures are trying to find a reason to not honor the arrangement you have  a farmer should do a little focusing on that type of thing exactly that's all part of the problem  absolutely i'm so with you with all that i don't think we're in any disagreement on that one that 
[01:25:00]  that needs to be uh that to me is a much more angering vulture-ish mentality than some fucking  dummy who's eating too many funyuns i don't care about the funny i mean i care about the funyuns guy  and that's huge what i care about is enough like opie said well enough is enough and we got a  fucking hand out of my pocket and we got to look at uh the people that are taking you know advantage of  the system all the way up to the executives taking yeah yeah you got to just run they're  all equally as bad i said no they're the same person you you don't like the big executive and 
[01:25:30]  stuff but that's you're talking a lot fewer of them than there are people taking advantage of uh  the system on a smaller level uh uh these social programs um so it it really does equal out in in  scumbaggery yeah no i don't think it does even though i don't think the motives are and i'm not  saying i don't just hate executives again i i executives a lot of times are the brilliant  people that make the companies run without executives you don't have companies you know 
[01:26:00]  it's not some radical you know if you make more than five million a year you're accrued it's not that  yes but what i see what's been going on in the last year it's despicable most executives are way  overpaid a lot of them are yeah but you do believe let me tell you something also on the news you will see  that a fuckload more than you'll see abuses of the system by people on welfare uh you will see you  know bernie made off that motherfucker should should have his head chopped off uh but they will show  bernie on the news every fucking day meanwhile you know go down let's see some abuses uh uh taking 
[01:26:30]  play fair enough but let's see that whole fucking that whole supermarket full of people spending their  money some wisely some poorly food stamps yeah that in their lifetime that entire supermarket full of  people will never do a tenth of the damage that one piece of did they will never do the damage he  did and they will never cost the economic domino problem that he caused and where is he in a medium  security jail you know something he's a criminal they're not they're just people wasting money 
[01:27:00]  having too many kids living beyond their means and that's not a crime but if one of them steals to get  some money they're going to fucking jail jail that fucking piece of shit is in a fairly for jail  comfortable medium security jail he's not doing hard time well i think you should be in that's all  part of the same of course you should be federal fuck you up the ass prison well we could continue  but we should take a break yeah phones are just ridiculous i mean look at this feedback  i'm we're never gonna get i'm hungry me too for love let's talk about tits next all right and i'll 
[01:27:30]  buy the cost of tits in america when we come back to the opian anthony show when we come back i have  a gig to plug i'm not gonna do it now i'm teasing it all right jimmy i'm teasing it we're seeing jimmy  norton i hope it's close but i bet it's not we also have this guy dr carol he was on the uh colbert  rapport uh last night and he wants to kind of debate you on the health care thing which is  kind of strange because we kind of did it i know but two hours but but you got a guy that's really 
[01:28:00]  going to you know be on the other side of this whole thing i want to hear his point and then uh  we also have andy levy from red eye coming yes very funny guy and uh kristen davis the uh madam  the madam i find them both more interesting by the way than this doctor we'll see what dr carol has to  say well carol i've never heard that name on a man before but i'm sure it's all right  and don't call me carol i think that's it for now quick break all righty yeah right opian anthony 
[01:28:30]  i was hanging with jerry cantrell and uh sean kinney yesterday anthony it's too bad you don't live in  the city no way no way no how no way no how you could have came back to sirius xm and you could  have you know done some time with jerry he would have been well worth the fucking eight hour drive  home in rush hour yeah i brought up the fact that uh we used to hang with him in the af days mostly i 
[01:29:00]  don't think we we might have interviewed him once did i we might have interviewed him once when um  we were at any w i'm not really sure about that to be quite honest but af days we uh hung with him a  a few times and he remembered us for real yeah because he you know he brought up dave douglas  of course somebody okay you do remember us he goes of course right dave douglas and uh i could  have went to the listening party for the new alice and chains album last night i i i have a tough time 
[01:29:30]  calling this an alice and chains album because i i'm a huge lane staley fan i know anthony's a huge  lane staley fan and i do know jerry cantrell sang a lot of uh you know the songs and and and and  and harmonized with with uh lane staley yeah but it's kind of tough to to go on when lane staley was  i think the the voice of alice and chains just there's one of those unique voices that's very hard to  uh uh just throw a new guy in some bands you could do that you could throw a new guy in it's like oh  the guy had kind of a raspy sound so you do this but his was really unique and just all that that 
[01:30:00]  fucking heroin pain and shit was all in there and i wish jerry and sean and the rest of the guys nothing  but the best but it's just a little weird for me that's all i'm saying yeah but i mean it also should  should be said that jerry cantrell pretty much wrote all of the alice and chains material lane staley  basically just sang basically but you know something he would put a little input here and there in the  creative process but he was basically the lead singer i think you could look though and see 
[01:30:30]  where his inspiration for some of those songs came from that's true look at watching lane that's true  you know and the thing i learned about the new album this william lead singer is william anybody uh  william something william he sang with jerry on his uh his solo projects all right dead and as far as  this album goes there there are co-lead vocals jerry cantrell and this guy so this guy isn't the  official lead singer of uh alice and james there are a few songs uh that alice and james did that 
[01:31:00]  they kind of traded on and off vocals which you know they did very well right um yeah but for the  most part jerry cantrell did a lot of the uh backup vocals which were really cool because i that's what  i like about alice and james i think was it the most or second most the music is just like great  oh some of those driving music some of those riffs are ridiculous but that that um that that  harmony that they they put together the weirdest kind of dark sounding harmonies that were really  good that's what i kind of that's why i did it so much yeah they made it like a love song out of 
[01:31:30]  someone nodding out on heroin basically how do you do that william duvall thank you i i it was right  on the tip of my tongue and i know a lot of alice and james no not that i mean i think they made  i think they made an educated decision here though because they started going out on the road with  william and they were well received people like right on you kind of sound like lane and this is  kind of cool and they took their time because lane died what at this point six years ago something like  that actually probably more probably seven years ago so they every time you think it's six it's 
[01:32:00]  probably ten and they and they probably not probably i think this is the first alice and  chains album in 14 years so they really did take their time and they they have decided let's give  let's give this a shot so i wish them nothing but the best it's still a little weird uh for me  seven years but the stuff i've heard uh from alice and chains is not not the new alice and chains  album not bad yeah not bad but the point is did some time with jerry and sean and they're going to 
[01:32:30]  be coming in studio and uh they said they would play we'll see we'll see that would be cool i think  they might have been you know being nice at that point but i i said look you have nothing to lose you  come in and play some songs man we got a huge audience rock and i go me and and are huge fans  i represent yeah i go and is also a huge fan of the band and uh so shooting that's all right  it's like a retard looking at a pinwheel when they put guns on the screen to me i know you just went  uh and yesterday jim brewer did an interview and i taped it and i i threw it up on my uh my youtube 
[01:33:00]  channel if you want to take a peek it's hard to hear uh jerry because he's very soft-spoken talking  about lean steely so people are bitching that you can barely hear him turn up listen i when i  uploaded the video last night i heard him just fine i might have had to crank up my audio a  little louder than usual but you can hear it turn up the volume right it's op radio on youtube or  op radio on uh on twitter but one of the one of the really funny things i saw on twitter yesterday  my the highlight of my twitter day because you know you have your uh twitter highlights absolutely 
[01:33:30]  there you go all right this is what i really dug about hold on hold on hold on because i know we're  going to move on uh ralph is saying that lane wrote a lot of their songs is that true i don't  know i don't like them i don't care i heard i heard it was mostly jerry cantrell from all the drug  references i would assume lane wrote them but you know you could have jerry cantrell watching lane  and just going jesus christ is an inspiring guy to write a song about if you could research that a  little bit because i want to i want to stand by the fact that i think jerry wrote just you know most of 
[01:34:00]  the stuff certainly but go ahead uh yeah it's an inspiring twitter of the day the funny twitter  of the day was uh had to be given to jim james james norton james p james uh p norton yeah uh taking  the picture of club soda kenny rubbing his cock on the mic stand it's uh the comments were the funniest  thing because no one really commented on the fact that he was dicking the mic stand they only made fun of 
[01:34:30]  his suit his ill-fitting suit one guy said his suit looks like he got it from uh the set of barney  miller uh uh did he get it from a coffin it was just this horrible kenny's suits have dirt on the  back of them ill-fitting suit the comments were really fucking funny man i'm a huge fan of the  comments of all the pictures i post videos i post there's some people and fuckers that listen funny  they're brutal it's just uh actually when i post the picture i get very excited about what they're 
[01:35:00]  gonna say yeah as long as they you know they get one or two at this point i don't have time for haters  i just don't you know if you're throwing someone on the bus and you mean well i don't care there  there's a very obvious difference but i you know i just don't have time for the haters anymore  i just you're always going to get uh i understand i understand but i i'm psyched that most of the  people that you know follow my shit are you know just they're keeping it they're keeping it cool so  i i just want to say i appreciate that uh speaking of jimmy remember his fishing rant 
[01:35:30]  no i don't i sure remember i think coke logic should be animating the  fuck out of that one too oh lane co-wrote lyrics only credited on three songs for music all right  that's where well that's where i was at i i assumed only three songs okay for music  i assumed lane wrote the lyrics but but uh co-wrote lyrics that's that's a little  jerry chantrell kind of i bet the music i bet you jerry wrote most of the songs and and kind of you 
[01:36:00]  know yeah come on oh there's so many like great lane drug songs could you could you study a little  further danny if you wound up dying of of an od like that and you listen to alice and chain songs  you're like all right so figure that out so jerry wrote just about all the music yeah right yeah and  probably right right some of the other guys yeah helped out with that and then lane co-wrote the  lyrics which means jerry was writing the lyrics they would sit there and just kind of yeah 
[01:36:30]  hash out a few things okay one comes up with the chorus one comes up with the verse things like that  uh now someone's writing snore oh well oh yeah oh well how can they sorry i showed my people be asleep  i never understood how can they be asleep and actually snore and type it in i don't understand that  some people just put z's they go z like they're sleeping sorry sorry i uh i wanted to saw wood  sorry i wanted to share my afternoon with you i apologize our lady peace was here too yesterday 
[01:37:00]  i remember them from the af do you remember when they played in a closet for us for real ah yes i  remember that one do you do you remember for real think closet think this is we never got respect in this  business i dream we're running out of time but i'm thinking we are though we've been at this a long  time and my dream is that someday we get real respect in this business right i'm still holding  out smart i'm still holding out for that but it was at af we were doing afternoons we had to go to 
[01:37:30]  the venue for a van halen show we were interviewing van halen the second time not the one at the uh  worcester center right where eddie walked by and we saw him for the first time we kind of freaked  out we were starstruck let's be honest yes and helen this was with uh sammy hagar and all and uh  our lady piece warmed up and they wanted to play for us but our broadcast center was literally a  oversized closet that's that's what they were willing to give us that day i can't believe you 
[01:38:00]  don't remember this i don't we were making all sorts of jokes there was a mop in the corner as we're  trying to broadcast sure wasn't me he said mop not mope no i'm the mope remember um and and they  played acoustically in a closet and then they were really bummed out at at their performance i we we  we were like wow that was really good and i forgot the lead singer's name he's like it's early or  whatever he said and i'm like look man we're doing this in a closet i think for a closet performance this 
[01:38:30]  is pretty damn good i was in a complete alcoholic days back then i back then i uh i really don't  remember you don't remember this one huh no i was trying to like keep certain things out of my head  see that's why i got to write most of the book you don't you don't remember a lot of this stuff i  remember good things from a long long time ago like when i was five and then and then it gets hazy  uncle paul it was such a good boy anthony yeah oh boy always loved the lollipop it gets hazy yes you  guys suck play more spin doctors oh boy now we now we got doctors and yes jerry cantrell also had 
[01:39:00]  uh his drug issues major drug issues he was going down the same road as lane was not quite went to  the end of lanes well lane went to the end of the road and uh jerry jerry was able to get off the road  before the road ended yeah uh fishing is not a sport remember that i certainly do derek and steve put a  little something something together based on jimmy's brilliant rant that should be animated  by coke logic what are you waiting for it coke logic blow off all your other projects i've been 
[01:39:30]  following your tweets enough busy man enough with all these projects sick to one making animations  for our show that's all we care about for no money for no money by the way yeah  attention anglers still convinced that fishing is a sport well renowned sportsman james norton  presents the ultimate cure for your delusion how smart do you have to be to beat this animal  psychologically what a dumb animal the fish is introducing fishing is not a sport you douche 
[01:40:00]  not a sport it's not a sport go in the water with your fist and punch the fish that's a sport  you're standing in a fucking boat it's not a sport you have a hook and the fish has nothing but hunger  this collection is presented on nine full-length high fidelity audio cassettes and will thoroughly  convince you that your leisure activity is a colossal waste of time you and some other  jizz bucket and fucking waiters and a big god standing there in 10 degree water drinking pabst blue  ribbon trying to hook some asshole fish you're not a sportsman you're not out there sporting despite 
[01:40:30]  what you may think fishing is not a battle of wits it's not stacked equally between a dumb  fucking fish who has been doing the same thing since dinosaurs were shitting all over manhattan  do you understand that fish was no smarter when a tyrannosaurus was shitting on 70th street and  broadway put down that stupid fishing pole and pick up your copies of fishing is not a sport you  douche narrated by james norton i'm just letting you know you're not a sportsman i like it sportsmen 
[01:41:00]  talk to my brothers he's a marine biologist and he uh doesn't think uh fishing's a sport no no  although he he would know although he just uh he freaking him and his son carson caught a 48 pound  striped bass that's a biggie that's good eating that's a biggie so you got to say when people  either hunt or catch something fishing yeah that's a big that's good eating i saw the pictures i was like  holy shit yeah that's pretty fucking cool lane wrote most of dirt and a bunch of uh jug uh drug songs 
[01:41:30]  uh and uh another guy saying that jerry wrote probably 90 of the songs that's i think that's  i think that's what it is yeah like half and half no 90 is not half and half you know it is with the  government oh i see you're using obama rules yes all right uh moving on other things happen in the 
[01:42:00]  world steelers quarterback ben roethlisberger accused of raping a woman what the fuck is this about  rape he's a he's a big sports star he shouldn't be raping women you know you know is this going  to be a misunderstanding right jimmy misunderstanding i didn't particularly like her story because she  didn't go to the cops she's just suing him and uh i don't know really maybe for a payday i don't know  or maybe she was scared to go to the cops you got she was an employee she was afraid of being fired 
[01:42:30]  right which may be true but i didn't like the way she described it um i that to me does not sound  like some kind of a violent rape and then a year later she shows up i just don't buy it super bowl  winning quarterback ben roethlisberger of the steelers is the recipient of a lawsuit from a  woman who was accusing him of raping her last summer in his penthouse hotel room in lake tahoe  roethlisberger's attorney adamantly denied the allegations pointing out the woman who was working  at the hotel never went to the authorities but the alleged victim who was seeking four hundred 
[01:43:00]  forty thousand dollars in damages contends the harris hotel and their top executives went to great  ways to cover up the incident adding she feared she would lose her job the steelers and the nfl  commissioner said they were looking into those allegations hmm jimmy gave me some advice a long  time ago and i laughed at him when he said this and and i think rich voss has said the same thing  when you like it when you bring out like a a woman uh you know to your hotel room whatever 
[01:43:30]  you make sure everyone kind of knows in the lobby yeah especially i've seen especially especially  especially on the way out and i'm like what you're paranoid jimmy come on i got that from boss  you're paranoid kind of makes sense right yeah just like when the elevator door opens yell hope you  enjoyed your fucking yeah and then she says yes what what was the advice jim you like when you're  walking through the lobby you stop off at the desk and ask them a question for a wake-up call  where they can see you and the girl kind of happy together and joking right because a lot of times 
[01:44:00]  women it's not paranoia a lot of times you'll have a regret about acting like a whore or their boyfriend  or husband finds out and they gotta make you know you know i mean it's like it's you want they can file  force charged against you i've never had it happen but it's very scary yes um and i'm not saying  that's the case here i don't know what i don't know this this woman personally i don't buy her story  just because of the way i read the description but uh i i'm a firm believer if you want to sue a guy like  that then you should go to the police and after a criminal conviction then you go for a suit because 
[01:44:30]  the law has said that he did it right but you know just to sue the guy i question that uh moving  backwards someone said holy shit steve c did a bit give him a monday off i didn't like the way  the audio was like on the phone in that one but then again i hate the sound of my own voice  i love it uh and we discussed this morning that steve is a complete psychopath because he  went about his job yesterday and today like nothing happened yesterday was there any discussions  after the big uh steve blowout uh yesterday danny none that i had none that i was involved in no fallout 
[01:45:00]  no no we had our radiation we had our meeting not even a clue that this went on yesterday no  unbelievable  it's the strangest business ever really is you would think there'd be some sitting down and  talking after what went on on the air yesterday when you heard on the air yesterday some people  tuned out whatever you're gonna do what you're gonna do most people over thought it was pretty  cool uh look at the inside you would think some some talking would have happened after that 
[01:45:30]  no what you heard was it that's it there's no update to that wow just happened and that was it  now it's back to business as usual uh so sopranos episode yeah exactly no no tying up those loose  ends that's it and where are we at with the espn girl it's on the front page again today she uh very  angry oh no shit lawyers are like out for blood hot how many people how many people got that virus  trying to find that video by the way yeah someone put a virus on the links a lot of links who put 
[01:46:00]  the virus in i don't know they don't know but uh they're assuming it's somebody that you know her  camp friends with her and said look i'll i'll help this situation a little bit yeah and then you get uh  you get a thumbnail that says uh here it is here's here's the video you click on it and you get a  virus boom a virus and that and that stops people from searching it because i mean the one thing we're all  scared of these days is uh computer viruses the aids the aids for the computer yeah no one wants that 
[01:46:30]  shit uh let me say hi to brian in massachusetts brian brian hey uh i just want to touch base a little  jimmy there and make a note that he's never experienced that with a woman because uh he uh  pays for a uh level of professionalism never experienced what uh the the rape allegations jimmy  acts for a receipt when he's done so no i picked off plenty of them in my day and um i'm always  careful at the end i never want someone to feel like a whore walking out i really don't i want  to feel bad walking out you know just flick the money at him rolled up here oh yeah or i'll actually 
[01:47:00]  make this little triangular football and i'll snap it at her face and i'll say catch with your teeth  sex pig like you did my dick  yeah i'm nice to girls yeah just all right sir thank you um we got a cop that's in trouble  what happened what do you do well he makes news for allegedly stealing donuts from a uh dunkin why 
[01:47:30]  that's is this really happening that must just anger other police officers like why are you doing  this it's a horrible stereotype that we need to stop that they like donuts yeah it's it's horrible  why do we continue a lot of cops i don't think i've ever seen one shoving donuts in their face  i know a lot of rock should be a cop yes he should be dude that video i posted yesterday was pretty  fucking funny just walking yeah we uh we beat him up for eating too much and then we go to break and 
[01:48:00]  he walks in with a mouthful of food i'm like why would you do that to yourself yeah his answer was  because i don't give a shit yeah people kind of like them uh for that i think people are starting  to they're like rocks yeah that goes n y pd i i know a lot of those guys and they they like their  starbucks yeah i don't know if they like their donuts donuts donuts donuts the accusation prompted  residents in the rockaways to snicker sources say 38 year old sergeant eric turetsky made a habit of  swaggering into this beach 129th sweet dunkin donuts then helping himself to pastries and coffee 
[01:48:30]  pix news found the alleged donut thief on desk duty inside the 100th precinct but he politely  declined to comment i think it's pretty ridiculous that a cop would just take advantage and steal two  dollar donuts because he has a uniform on sources say sergeant turetsky often left small tips for the  dunkin donuts manager though the cash was never enough to cover the bill it's against departmental  guidelines for officers to accept free food or gifts from stores and residents more than 10 years 
[01:49:00]  ago turetsky made headlines during the abner louis police torture case back then the accused donut  thief was one of the whistleblowing officers who identified justin volpe as the crooked cop who  sodomized a haitian immigrant if found guilty of plundering pastries turetsky could face official  reprimand or loss of reprimand or loss of vacation days  i'm weak i was weak i was weak i'm like donuts 
[01:49:30]  i'm sorry show me how you eat a donut show me with your mouth show me how you eat a cruller  i'm sorry i did so many bad things i tried to do the right thing but i'm weak i'm so  fucking weak listen how much he loves the donuts where do you put the donuts come on show me with

[01:50:30]  stores doing the right thing and going hey that's on us and they're letting the cop have his free cup  of coffee yeah then i see other scumbag owners in my neighborhood they're charging the cop two  dollars for a lousy little something something as this guy is in his neighborhood you know protecting  his store got to give it to him on the arm you have to they don't make enough yeah i mean if it's like  if it's an over-the-top steak dinner then i i can understand that it might be hurting business but  yeah i don't and i don't think you're supposed to i think it's one of those things they're not 
[01:51:00]  supposed to really accept that's why we're not you know yeah i'm not naming names or anything but  the store owner should do the right thing and let them have it yeah and they're not asking for it but  you should just go yeah that's on us thank you you know have a nice day watching the girl on the  fucking bed lieutenant show with her mouth how she sucks a cock while he jerks off on her show me how  you drive a store and the other sister is there in the passenger seat showing her ass she has her pants  pull down showing her ass you show me your ass and then he's just jacking off at the windows saying

[01:57:30]  still do my best whatever all right um moving on stopped us from being able to do that not teasing  of course and then what's the other section why is this uh and whatever how can we say we're the  only radio guys in there and rush limbaugh's right next to us bill o'reilly's over us  yeah i don't know and why are we in black and white everyone else is in color by the way they 
[01:58:00]  probably looked at the color picture and went wow we're gonna put these guys in black and white  jesus christ yeah you know look awful enough black and white pictures are way better should have done  a sepia tone uh let's say how to adam in connecticut oh by the way my list would have continued but i just  got bored yeah because now people go why didn't you mention this or this whatever no no one needs to  you are short with the radio guys that do a good show adam what do you got yeah when you're talking  about what the girl you know how the girl's parents felt when they went to the movie and saw her yeah 
[01:58:30]  be like the same thing in lethal weapon when danny glover told everybody to watch his daughter in a  commercial and she did all right for condoms all right yeah there you go yeah yeah that's it you  got to think that is really happening in real life the condom commercial and you're putting your  parents in an awkward position like god damn i thought you were going to be like a merle streep you're  you're you're you're showing how you you know blow guys yeah next day at work you got a condom tree  on your desk i thought that chick was hot that um lethal weapon daughter there everybody's always  accusing me of being very racist and that i would never find a black woman attractive uh i'm accused 
[01:59:00]  of that all the time but uh she was very attractive yeah absolutely because she had white features and  um and i'm teasing now uh let me say hi to sean in albany sean  hey opi hey hey i've never had a problem with anything y'all have done before yeah but that  bobo talking to himself video made it way too real really yeah dad's grave and everything i started 
[01:59:30]  fucking which one was that it's one of my videos oh the behind the scenes thing i'm becoming a video  fucking weirdo filming everything and poor uh bobo talks about his father well it started out fun it was  it was stupid it was like him talking to uh his picture from like a few years ago and then next  thing you know he's given the old bobo advice about his dead father and his then and his grave and how  sad you're going to be when you finally find the grave of your father as he's talking he's talking about 
[02:00:00]  himself yeah in the past and you're going to be really sad because you know it's overgrown and it's  sturdy and i'm like can i hear this for real yeah all right we got it up here right the studio here  well it's a long video though thanks sean get a little bit of camera it's on my youtube channel  bobo bobo staring at a picture of bobo i have to stare at this picture until i see christina's face  who told you to do that troy told me to troy told you you have to hold the baby po 
[02:00:30]  it's like abuse until you see your new girlfriend yeah face otherwise i'll never see your face again  so i have to sit in front of a picture of myself i think this picture was taken in may i know it was  right before the animation festival you just found out that your mom got your tickets to the  animation festival and you're going to see ob and anthony on stage for the first time ever  and she said it's going to make up for you not having tickets to the virus show in 2007 
[02:01:00]  and you're going to be sitting in the second row he's talking to his picture yeah that's creepy  and anthony might end up seeing you on stage i know you ran it i know you made iraq puke with a  picture of a tumor that was removed from a dog that your mother used to take care of  and it made iraq puke i remember it's going to creep out stalker patty which i know you're going  to really enjoy when that creeps out patty and big a was cheering when he saw this he's going to be 
[02:01:30]  cheering you're also going to run some people from philadelphia but don't worry about those philly  fans they have they have respect for you even though you're a met fan but just remember during  the game there are enemies during the game remember that and uh you might also want to know that  your your father is buried in i think it's with long cemetery not far from republic airport  that i know for sure and please when you see your father's grave make an effort to clean it up 
[02:02:00]  because they never no one ever maintained it all these years my uncle forgot the directions of where  he was where he was buried and that kind of upset you all these years and you're going to be very  upset when you see how it hasn't been maintained his grave as a matter of fact the first thing you see  is great if i could tell you the path of my past you my past self bring a hedge trimmer to that 
[02:02:30]  grave site here's great sports all the back oxy clean oxy clean and while you're at it uh a little  bit of a heads up might want to arrange for an encounter with tippy tom if you want to meet tippy  tom because he's gonna pass away you're gonna find out he died he's talking to his past self yeah  tippy tom which would have been freaking hilarious 
[02:03:00]  and uh  well and uh while you're at it the heads up you're gonna have to show off your junk the first  the second time you go into the hopey and anthony show you're gonna have to show it just a heads up  but don't worry it'll be worth it because you'll get to go you'll get virus tickets and they yeah  that's a that it's a picture of yourself i guess i could say look i'm 2008 bobo i have no idea the 
[02:03:30]  mets are going to collapse two years in a row i have no idea that i'm actually going to get to go on the  opium and anthony show i didn't even know that i could go to fifth did they have bleachers on 57th street  yet i didn't i don't even have an xm yet at this at this time i'm uh i'm listening to krock my my  alarm clock goes off on my stereo and i hear every single morning it goes off and even on the weekends 
[02:04:00]  i got i got a program to do that for my ipod  now now as a matter of fact 2009 i still  oh holy shit the pullback is fantastic thank you sir oh thank you yeah he's two feet away from it  i pulled back and you now see the whole room and there's literally what 12 people watching him  watching himself and he might as well be alone there he's just concentrating on the picture of 
[02:04:30]  himself from the past yeah talking to it that is fantastic thank you sir yeah you got some compliments  on that one oh opi radio on youtube if you want to check it out for yourself it's creepy god did the  father should get to you or no because i don't know where you're at with emotions but it's not bobo it's  not bobo it's just a dude talking about no i found it fascinating it wasn't kind of like a uh  that doesn't get to you a little bit kind of a thing no it's tough to get to me these days i  understand that i'm uh my emotions are just like they're gone they really are just gone i don't know 
[02:05:00]  how are we going to bring them back although sometimes i could just sit there and feel bad  watching a movie all alone by myself what movie i don't know these days let me try to think um  um shit it's always the same old ones patch of blue and jungle fever  to be bringing back the comedy thank you we're getting a little too silly  it is that there there are certain movies though where i'm just kind of like oh 
[02:05:30]  no that that is pretty fucking sad and things like that i'm scared to admit i saw a movie that  uh wow i gotta admit i liked it though the 500 days of summer  guy meets this girl named summer it's a relationship movie uh-oh beginning and end  huh uh i don't know what i want to say about it because uh well the title kind of gives it away  if it's 500 days of summer that means they they probably end the relationship after 500 days or do 
[02:06:00]  they do they give you the hollywood ending oh yeah all right all right we're giving i won't see it  no you probably wouldn't i was surprised i liked it you know it wasn't the same old hollywood  shit it was kind of like it was kind of formula indie film yeah a formula indie film it you know but  there's uh a movie out oh let's see look at the cover though again the guy and the girl anytime 
[02:06:30]  there's the guy and the girl on the cover i understand like that that's why i'm like full  shot cover i get like that's why i was like oh man and you know what my girl was cool because she  goes i want to see this movie and i looked i'm like look come on and she goes i i think you're  gonna like it though so i read up by i'm like all right you know what i mean yeah because i mean my  girl's cool enough where i don't i don't get dragged to movies like i probably did in the past because i  didn't speak up uh and it's and it's the kid from uh third rock from the sun the little the little 
[02:07:00]  kid how was him now growing up yeah we had him on the show and it wasn't very good and it's the chick  from uh elf that sang that fucking solid song the will farrell movie yeah i only saw that once  where she spilted out that tune i was like she was great in it by the way great zoe deschanel  yeah did you see this movie travis no i just know her she's also in a band called she and him out of  everyone that works here i think you're the only other person that would see this movie for real yeah  i saw a commercial for it it doesn't look like terrible yeah she was good though basically ah 
[02:07:30]  whatever what's that movie about something not area is it area nine district nine district nine  yeah i was just talking about that it looks it looks good but sci-fi shit yeah it's like sci-fi  aliens and shit it looks cool but i gotta get out of the habit of like hyping myself up about is it  half-life-ish because i think district nine there's some kind of thing like in half-life the game where  they did that so i'm wondering if it's kind of a it's like like aliens came uh to the world like 30 years 
[02:08:00]  ago and like but they've been like segregated so it's just like they're they're not they're not  allowed to mix with humans and humans keep themselves and they're supposed to keep themselves  and they have it they have their own like alien reservation can't say the a word  that's just stupid though it looks pretty cool yeah wait a minute but if they were able to get here  30 years ago that how are we controlling them um are they going to explain that maybe it's what  we were talking about the other day they have a horrible ship it's built of wood  they just know how to travel uh to other planets and nothing else yeah they have no common sense 
[02:08:30]  they're retarded is our guest here we should take another break i haven't heard we got andy leaving  coming in we got health care guy if he was listening to the show this morning he might not come in he  might be scared to come in oh i'm sure yeah but he's pretty brave he says uh he he's wanted to debate  you for a while i want to hear he says that he tries to call a show but could never get through  because he's got to call on the regular line and i mean you know the phones are always lit i just 
[02:09:00]  want to hear um unless we're talking about a movie called 500 days of summer and then the  phones aren't lit so much not so much could go right back to health care and get these things lit  so much all right we'll do a quick break i just gotta plug this before oh jimmy yes i forgot you  were in studio you've been so quiet i'm just thinking about the taxes i gotta pay that i can't afford  uh uh this thursday through saturday july 23rd through 25th i'll be at the punchline comedy club  in atlanta uh the thursday show is at 10 o'clock there was a weird booking so thursday friday saturday 
[02:09:30]  and friday the 31st and july uh and august 1st i'll be at the manhattan comedy club in middletown  new york which is about 45 minutes uh from the city it's my friend's club 8 and 10 30 both nights  dude you're seething yeah why what changed you nothing just this is certain situations you already know  them i already know them all right yeah the main one yeah yeah yeah you getting new info on that no 
[02:10:00]  no no why would i just yeah like it's not happening  it's amazing it's a game changer in the end trust me it's a game  fucking oh if if if if it's a game changer trust me thank god for other things holy  shit always we explain everything in the end so we gotta sit on this one for a while trust me  all right while we continue we'll get a guest in here next somebody's got to be wandering around 
[02:10:30]  either andy levy or uh yeah he just andy just got here okay does he make you smile jimmy i like  andy a lot yeah he does i like him on that red eye yeah he's very funny i think they should use him a  little more well he's he's now he's opening the show doing like a pre-game uh he's kind of they  they keep changing formats which i like it it keeps it from getting stale they kind of andy's always at  the end and now he's at the beginning and sometimes he's in the middle too like they always kind of  break it up which is great yeah he's very good he like keeps track of what people are saying yes 
[02:11:00]  kind of goofs on it yeah it's it's a great oh i don't care for that at all anthony very mean  spirit the trailer looks really good huh hey it looks pretty cool district nine district nine  when is this coming out i do believe august i want to say 14th although i'm not sure is anyone in it  of name no i don't think so why isn't anyone seeing bruno i know it did very well the first week because  i know that's kind of a crazy statement but that movie is going away fast why has anyone seen it here 
[02:11:30]  because probably could have set up the beauty of ali g was that that show was not set up it was  really in front of a lot of people great after the first weekend this movie did real well and then  is fading fast right borat was very overrated the scenes that were great were the ones where he was  just with real people they were brilliant no i know i like borat because i never saw ali g ah  watch the original now i've seen ali g but i saw borat before i checked that ass in the face scene  i never cared about that i thought it was much funnier when he's holding a bag of  shit to somebody's house like that type of stuff was fucking hilarious bruno why i think people are 
[02:12:00]  probably more comfortable seeing uh in general seeing an over the top foreign guy than an over  the top gay guy i think it has a lot to do with it that's kind of true i thought borat was a funny  good character does anyone have a desire to see the movie though i i don't know i've been at the movie  theater a couple times last weekend and it's right up there they have tickets available like i just i  don't have a desire like the commercials aren't selling me like the maybe i could chalk it up to  a shitty trailer like it just yeah the scenes that they cut it just didn't it didn't make me 
[02:12:30]  want to go run out and see it like uh borat yeah i liked it way better than i thought i would based  on the trailer like i saw it out of loyalty pretty much you liked it i really liked it by the way  district nine does look very half-life-ish really like yeah it looks like the video game half-life  was huge and i think that it really did influence a lot of modern yeah yeah that really but that has the  whole look like that really kind of maybe they just won't be looking maybe they just couldn't get  the name industrialized maybe yeah maybe they couldn't get the rights to it because i heard it 
[02:13:00]  was supposed to be a movie at some point gordon freeman and stuff but um yeah i'll have to see  that that looks pretty cool it looks pretty cool yeah good fucking effects i love when there's giant  ships in the air even independence day was kind of best part of that movie and it was a cornball  fucking movie but when you first see those ships straight when they first bring them out of the  smoke like first it's just a bunch of smoke and then the fire and then the ship comes out you're  like jesus that is a great how are the special effects in that movie uh looking back i mean when 
[02:13:30]  we saw the movie theaters it was that we we all said you know it'll never get better than this but  now i wonder yeah you know it's been a few years 90. fuck it's gotta be 90s yeah 95 or six  95 that late let me let me think let me know clinton was president 95 90 i'm going 90 98 99 hold  on hold on hold on 93. i'm going b.a.b days i do it by my radio gigs i'm i'm doing 90 uh 96. damn it 
[02:14:00]  96. i was way off i was already doing radio what the fuck we were in boston yeah no i remember seeing  it wait a minute maybe i came home for the weekend because i remember know where i saw the movie was  the comac uh i was gonna say motor in see it on the fucking mirrored ceiling in the jungle room  i i went to that fucking comac cinema which is just the scariest place on earth now that used to be  that used to be the place to go to see movies now i haven't been there in probably 10 years 
[02:14:30]  i've heard the stories el salvadorian gangs have taken over the place no joke it's scary yeah  close to that brentwood the hell's going on in that town very scary stuff going on in there with  some graffiti signs of gangs that i'm not even i ain't even screwing around no no let them write  on whatever the fuck they want yes i'll just stay away exactly i'll take a picture and say wow that's  beautiful artwork ah look all right why don't we take a break tinkle yeah tinkle time all right 
[02:15:00]  oh see i like this one  space hog yeah in the meantime  opie and anthony jim norton and andy levy for the first time on our show from red eye  big fan actually thank you finally what you do on that show sorry i'm late i was on that porn.com  site yeah porn.com yeah how do i that'll take you somewhere completely different yeah it's a bad 
[02:15:30]  combination actually that's the one that um yeah pete townsend went to porn.com i mean research was  staying in the front of his pants to carry glitters helping him out yeah making sure jeffrey jones  didn't have any crime files we were just talking about twitter because i follow you on twitter and  um i saw something last night on letterman uh which kind of you know when things uh uh are kind  of in the mainstream and then you notice people are starting to catch on to it that shouldn't and 
[02:16:00]  you realize it's done i'm kind of feeling like that about twitter let me start about twitter well  it wasn't letterman so much as uh his guest who god damn i i was hoping it would just pop into my head  before it really had to pop out of my mouth but it's uh what's his name um uh yeah he was in that  front portion yes it's always for you kevin spacey is sitting there talking about um tweeting and  twittering and and uh it just seemed like oh this isn't good because david lederman's like ah what are 
[02:16:30]  you talking about this tweet twittering i i and then he goes i know what that sounds like after because  because he just went on and on about twittering and how he twitters john stamos and this that the  other it was really like this long-winded explanation and david lederman goes i know what  that sounds like and and seriously kevin spacey goes what he goes a huge waste of time and got a  giant laugh letterman's on twitter though is he yes you sure it's a letterman that's probably his  people yeah probably his people also have 25 million people a night we can chat with really exactly 
[02:17:00]  let us chat to a few people dave yeah you're a smart guy twittering usually me yeah you put up  these these um uh links and stuff to very very intelligent very you know you learn something from  your your your tweets really and then sometimes it's just you know you're an ass you know you'll  tell me you'll tell me i'm an ass are they are they thought-provoking yes thought-provoking  intelligence find them i like to take like a sideways look at the news sometimes oh you know 
[02:17:30]  a little skewed yeah kind of uh thing there yeah what do you like in the news uh today anything uh  i saw that uh was carolyn maloney's in a little bit of trouble representative from off of a drop  yeah yeah it wasn't even her saying i know like well she said it but she was repeating she's repeating  someone else yeah yeah that's the double n-word yeah n once removed we call it in the politically  correct circles but i'm pretty sure she should go to jail for it yeah of course i agree because we 
[02:18:00]  have a black president for god's sake send her away from guantanamo let loose the uh sarah put  anyone that uses the n-word there we're talking about uh bruno and why it's not doing what do you  think there's a trailer because there's missed reviews and people just it's not getting the same  vibe that uh yeah i just i think i haven't seen it but uh i saw you know they do the cinema score  numbers where they people in the theater rate the movies from a to f and it got a c and that's  incredibly low for for any movie so it i gotta think just bad word of mouth is killing it especially 
[02:18:30]  on the heels of uh borat which you know did very well yeah you get a c coming out of there i don't  know i didn't know that's it they said what does he suck in the movie it was c oh no this is gay  i love the part and a lot of people are complaining it wasn't gay enough so i think  that'll kill you in middle america they probably overthought him and made it too safe so the word  amounts like uh don't bother probably he seems to get a lot of press making his movies more so than 
[02:19:00]  after the movie comes out because there's always oh boy look he's at it again those english papers  like to follow people around like that i don't believe anything on the web that has that dot uk  like i don't i just the second i see a story i'm like i'll go to drudge and i'll i'll be like holy  shit really like that happened they found some kind of a piece of a ufo or and i'll click and it's like  oh dot uk okay well that's like have you have you read pravda oh yeah well that's the uh used to be the 
[02:19:30]  state newspaper for the soviet union and now it's just this wacky like bizarre website where everything  is ufos and oh my god it's like the old world weekly news yeah it that's exactly what it's like  it's like the uh weekly world news which is unbelievable there we have the bath boy  the bath boy is very scary and it's always like you know professor predicts that u.s will be giant  hole by 2011. yeah you gotta click the link you know oh absolutely click every time but there's 
[02:20:00]  it's always it's always a professor saying something yeah yeah some professor so russian  professor used to be great uh back in soviet union now i pump gasoline but i know still a lot  uh moving back to twitter mike writes you know that twitter's time has come to an end when larry king  is twittering which he is um twitter is he yeah he he knows he promotes nothing he promotes his twitter  on his uh show every night does he even know what it is reach me on twitter yeah i don't know who knows 
[02:20:30]  what he knows i think it's next to my prostate it hurts you're not a fan of larry are you i was uh  back when the show was hosted by a live person i thought it was actually not that bad we actually  we actually now watch because it's so ridiculous uh it's one of our favorite bits we're doing lately  is bringing the larry king audio and we're just amazed at what he's doing with that dumb show i don't  think anyone from cnn is watching him to to know like oh my god he lost his mind years ago and we have to 
[02:21:00]  remove him from the airwaves they just he doesn't know what he's saying half the time yeah he's  basically animatronic now i think yeah yeah i think he's just stuffed with little uh cogs and uh uh  rods and because talking to joe jackson he was talking to him uh and and asking him you know what uh  how do you feel about your son's death well what's he supposed to say i don't even if he didn't care  well what he's supposed to say is i have a new record label coming yeah yeah that's what he did that was uh 
[02:21:30]  remarkable i thought i was a plug whore i never did it on my son's casket  probably signed the contract right on the casket  the best larry king ever was uh asking the skateboarder how important the board is  when you're skateboarding fell down that's when we that's when we went wait a minute wait a minute  something's going on with larry king he had nothing and then he tried to i even saw the promo for uh  larry king talking to joe jackson and they tried to hip him up by adding in the clip where he goes 
[02:22:00]  like straighten me out he's talking to joe jackson i guess joe said you know i'm i'm being straight i'm  being straight with you or i'm straightening out everybody and he goes straighten me out he's like  he didn't get a fist in the face yeah yeah that's how joe jackson like i did my things out  you out like the colonel at the end of boogie nights that's how you get straight  big fucking a big non-white penis right in his larry king face straighten him right out  steven s from basher larry king so joe it's one down four to go comment 
[02:22:30]  and then and the steven also writes uh larry king is lucky his heart is still twittering  slightly in his chest oh is that what it is yeah larry king twittering and stuff because then people  it's always the the thing that that is a fad i guess and the technos pick it up at first and then it  just becomes this thing where you know grandma's twittering we we have a special thing that just  twitters i love how old people just need one thing like that phone with the giant button for help 
[02:23:00]  and and it's uh i think meredith baxter bernie does the commercial and you kind of forget she's  an old lady now and she's talking about i don't need a phone where i need to call all kinds of people  but if i need help it's just a giant red button that you push and i guess it's a help button  i guess it's like undertakers on the other end like if my ex tv son's hat falls off again  yeah yeah i got it big numbers it's what you give the children it's like a tracking thing 
[02:23:30]  my new favorite bit is jim nord get it i like to make sure that people get my jokes are very high  growl you did that on the show last on red eyes yeah yeah get it yeah just in case something yeah  just in case they didn't get my john and kate plus eight show i should drive it home  yeah twittered i uh dvr'd i didn't twitter i haven't seen very hard to do it's only 140  and it's illegal it's fox content i know uh-oh barely get through the opening with that 140  character thing the thing i don't get i don't get facebook at all no no yeah i i kind of bailed out of 
[02:24:00]  that quickly yeah i was myspace for a little while because it was kind of new right you get the  facebook it's just because anytime i go on there all i i end up spending three and a half hours  blocking applications because i don't want to have water fights with people i don't know yeah  we've just i want to poke you yeah i got poked what does that mean can i come to your house and  shoot you now i hate the pokes and the invites and super pokes pillow party no this is a fucking 
[02:24:30]  unless it's like the end of cuckoo's nest that's a pillow party i want to attend  facebook goes too far and twitter doesn't go far enough twitter is like this very weird you know  that needs to grow a little bit i kind of like to give you a few more options twitter that no i  kind of like the simplicity just a couple more characters like what edit yeah yeah edit yourself  yeah especially if you're posting a picture or a link or something you got to do that first i learned  that you type something out and it's like all right that's well worded now i put the link holy  shit it took away my letter minus 17 characters like this gotta go go go unimportant punctuations 
[02:25:00]  fuck that well people if i take out the u will cnt get the pointer  start removing vowels i kind of like that though that you're limited to that amount  you called me a can't but twitter will blow it you know they're gonna add more characters  they're gonna blow it and go all right now 160 and then you're just gonna get people because some  people just bam bam one after the other like like you get five in a row because they 140 is a little 
[02:25:30]  i don't think a little short i don't think they can i think they're constricted by the the length  that a text message can be it's something to do with the phone companies yeah you know what that's  a very good point huh they'll split the letters up into one thing yeah i have no idea we got the uh  health guy here too what do you want to do oh that guy yeah no he well he wants to he wants to debate  on um health care on the health care issue that's funny and we kind of that's hysterical

[02:30:30]  lies about your body and health you're you're a doctor sir i am what type of doctor i'm a  pediatrician but i actually spend most of my time doing health services research allegedly  a pediatrician it's dr aaron carroll don't swallow your gum myths have truth and outright lies about  your body and health now uh i like the title because i was talking the other day i used to 
[02:31:00]  swallow my gum all the time totally fine uh but but it kind of got a little sticky in your in your  mouth no in coming out that rarely rarely happens your body's incredibly good at getting things from  one end to the other breaking it apart in there speak for yourself sir yeah you're trying to claim  that the gum was a little sticky in the way out of it for real yeah yeah come on i swear it would last  i don't know what it was maybe i was were you blowing bubbles yeah blowing bubbles out my 
[02:31:30]  help me i got a couple of times i think it went clean through and then you know during the um  cleaning process back there it just kind of you know wow it's a little gummy it's coming up to work  should not do that goes right through you yeah yep um dr and carol were you listening to our our uh  first hour today i unfortunately wasn't it turns out i mean i was listening a few minutes ago so i'm  i'm sorry you guys already did this well it was okay it was a doozy we can uh you know we can get  into it i just want to hear your point on um quickly in one sentence uh health care in the united 
[02:32:00]  states it's absolutely terrible and it needs major reform yes or no i would argue though probably even  further than what you were talking about this morning uh i'd argue that we should go all the  way to uh single-payer health care would give everybody basically medicare everybody gets  everybody in insurance everyone gets government insurance correct and now the big question has  always been where does this money come from well most every other country pays far less than we do for 
[02:32:30]  health care every other country and they all have socialized finance health care this is actually  conservative spending it's just a little bit more they probably pay far less for health care because  uh we are very litigious nation uh the insurance companies uh their their uh rates are unbelievably  high because of greed and the fact that uh there's so many lawsuits that it gets passed on us and the  quality of health care in the united states you see a lot of these uh children that are born with 
[02:33:00]  deformities and whatnot are usually brought to the united states because the health care is very good here  um uh so you kind of get what you pay for uh we're a large nation not you know okay you're making a lot  of arguments we should we should do them one all right let's let's start with uh the litigious society  you're right that we have more lawsuits here than in other countries but the truth all right thank you  for coming i like you saying all right and uh that was our guest dr aaron carroll yeah the the actual 
[02:33:30]  amount that lawsuits are are actually a pretty small tiny part of the whole and we argue that there's more  defensive medicine in the united states we say that doctors have to do extra tests to avoid being  sued that comprises best estimates about 80 to 90 billion dollars a year which is a drop in the  bucket of the two plus trillion dollars we're sure so we could reform the malpractice system that's  there's no argument there but that has nothing to do with single-payer insurance you also talk about  quality any metric of quality you pick honestly if you look at the data across the board be it infant  mortality maternal mortality uh life expectancy uh how well we're doing with with screening or 
[02:34:00]  vaccinations and we're doing worse than almost every other country you're correct that for some  high-tech procedures if you need a heart lung that's what i'm yeah come to the united states how many  people need that a year well uh ted kennedy sure needed a little brain surgery there and i didn't see  him going to uh canada i don't disagree with you so i'm probably getting the best doctor money could  buy and not using uh uh uh medicaid or uh anything you know that has nothing to do with the health  insurance blue cross and blue shield ain't doing your procedure a doctor's doing your procedure 
[02:34:30]  exactly but that but you're not going to get the best doctor under a government-run  i don't think that that's true and the data actually doesn't bear that out the system performs terribly  poorly we have phenomenal doctors we phenomenal hospitals but the system stinks and overall we're doing  really poorly we have to decide i'll agree with that by the way so we have to decide about how  to how we're going to form the system i would argue that we should form a system that that would  would would actually get better outcomes would actually cover more people and hopefully cost 
[02:35:00]  a little bit less that's what every other country has now how is it costing less is what i want to  know but by what what you uh because everything in the united states costs more money so that's part  of it in other words our doctors make a bit more money our drugs cost more money our hospitals cost more  money hats may cost more money i can't actually vouch for that um but but the problem is that uh is  that there's also a significant amount of overhead and waste in our system um that comes from having 
[02:35:30]  to employ tons of people to do different kinds of billing to to actually uh pay for some of the  private insurance and that that's not unnecessary and you honestly believe a government-run program  would have less waste well take medicare is the best example we have medicare medicare for better  for worse is socialized finance health care in the united states it is what canada has it's just  everybody over the age of 65 medicare's overhead is about three percent anywhere from eight to fifteen  percent and probably even closer to twenty percent for private insurance they are by far medicare the 
[02:36:00]  most efficient insurance system in the united one question very important would valtrex be covered  i'm asking for a friend not my own judgment errors yeah but the over 65 i understand that it's it  there's a big difference between a government-run agency supplying medical uh treatment for people  over 65 in this country than it is the entire country no it's really not in fact the over 65 is  a lot harder than for a 25 year old come on how is that you're talking about a lot of preventative 
[02:36:30]  medicine that's so much easier than the end of life care and everything else that we're having  to do for end of life care yes i'm not something we need to get rid of that's it yeah what happened  to your mic god damn it sorry about that why don't you just twitter it so so actually i mean there's  no reason to think if we can provide for everyone over the age of 65 that it won't work for a 64 year  old why why can't we do it i mean everybody said the same arguments before they put medicare in place  then medicare got established there's no one running on a platform of medicare's got to go 
[02:37:00]  you know we're all very happy with it why why can't we have it for everybody actually the  naked cowboy is running on the platform that is he that i have to go god is he oh oh literal dr  patrice o'neill has entered the studio as well hey good morning what's up man what's up patrice we  got dr aaron carroll yes and andy levy from red eyes hello sir how are you we're talking uh we're  talking health care uh uh financing said health care for the entire country so that uh i guess 
[02:37:30]  you know who who are the people that really need this that aren't getting it everybody well the  truth is not everybody no it's not everybody well everybody would benefit to some extent because  we're not i don't feel i'd benefit you don't feel you benefit right now because you're probably pretty  healthy no no i'm i'm probably not i'm saying pretty healthy physically wow financially his liver looks  like lots wife i'm saying financially i don't know if i benefit as much uh wanting to have um 
[02:38:00]  i i i don't like what i pay for health care no that's a lot of money you should make that but i have so  many options as to doctors i want to see uh the quality of care okay this is what this is what  i'm talking about but but you would but when people talk about choice as you just brought up they care  about their choice of doctor they care about their choice of hospital they care about their choice of 
[02:38:30]  treatment sure do you really care about your choice of insurance i mean most people get whatever  insurance is offered by their employer no i i i care about insurance paying for what i want as  far as care allows you to see any doctor in the united states for the most part go to any hospital that  you want to it has phenomenal benefits medicare offers almost more choice for what we care about  than almost anything they don't give you the added network they don't give you the added network  like in medicare okay anthony what's the conversation the doctor is saying i'm a radical homosexuals 
[02:39:00]  should be put down and anthony's saying this is very inappropriate really no it's medical you don't  they practice have the have the now the doctor's saying that he wants uh nationalized health care  or whatever am i correct pretty much using the medicare uh uh uh outline for the entire country and  not just the because i'm calling it niche it is a niche over 65 it's the worst is but it's a small 
[02:39:30]  percentage of the country now if you spread this out over the entire population of the united states  i feel it's going to cost more and i think it will again it will come out of more wealthy's pocket  but it's but it's gonna say it's utopia though what is two things that happen and one is  in in that great world is that really the doctors should just fucking help you like utopia right  now but in reality though the business sense uh health care for everybody is it's bad business 
[02:40:00]  to have health care be run nationwide because here's what meda wait here's a utopia meaning  medicare everybody gets cured everybody gets the chance again but when but when the government  runs health care like you see in these other countries that they keep it really quiet they're  deciding motherfuckers who can live and who dies if you get sick anthony and and and and the government  runs the thing they got to make a decision on whether you're worth keeping alive that's not how it 
[02:40:30]  works isn't i hate to tell you it's not how it works because um right now if you have medicare  they don't they don't make decisions about whether you can live or die medicare is not government though  we're talking this this socialist i'm talking about medicare for everyone i'm not okay you're  talking about a socialized system that's really only england but they're trying to do that no no  come on i'm as far as i'm as far left on this issue as you can possibly get no one's arguing for  that no one's arguing for the va system for everyone which is socialized medicine at most people are 
[02:41:00]  arguing for just the government to pay for care which is medicare that's what canada has france  has a system where women are dying of breast cancer which which is almost doesn't even happen here  breast cancer curates are actually better in canada than here i kid you not look at this you you're  listening i'm telling you look up the data so believe you but not don't believe me believe the  data from the wso and the cdc canadian women look at look at them dying from breast cancer 
[02:41:30]  joint canadian u.s healthcare study that our government and the canadian government did  together and publish and add that lion thing at the end where you said government you see this guy's a  good guy he believes in shit he just he still believes in like like things that are good i don't  i don't think you've heard me say anything about morals or good in this entire conversation  i'm asking about can i bring up a point then why no why then why then doesn't uh uh why don't 
[02:42:00]  american women that are stricken with breast cancer go to canada to get uh cured if it's so much better  up there it's it's actually it's i mean we're talking about a percentage and also here's the problem  is that uh is that one people in the united states with you those pussycasses that's also  rare sorry um all right let him listen let him uh answer that women in the united states can't go  to canada for care because you have to pay out of pocket they can't afford that if it's better care 
[02:42:30]  and you can afford it why don't you and again i'll bring up ted kennedy why didn't he go to canada  to get his brain taken care of if if the health care is so much better and he can afford the best  doctors he he stayed here in the united states i'm not arguing i said as i said before that that  there are not individual doctors or hospitals that are better in the united states it would just be  great if everybody could get to them and it would be everyone could it would be uh it would be diluted  but i believe the medical uh care that would be given to people would be diluted it sounds horrible 
[02:43:00]  i'm talking almost there's almost a survival of the fittest or survival of the more wealthy  or whatever that you want to call it doctors gave a shit if they actually gave a shit about  you living would be a great time he said chewing gum and swallowing anthony anthony you got to stop  using ted kennedy as an example this is a guy who when he wants to break up with a girl says come  on honey let's go for a ride it's just a bad example bring your bathing cap bitch what do you mean  we're going out to dinner but now what you're talking about is you're talking about nationalized 
[02:43:30]  health care and anthony's basically saying look if we nationalize health care will that further mixing of the  races which is you are an ass jesus trying to make a point here no no i just think there'd be this uh  uh diluting of the um of of your care the white race based on the white race uh a mongrel i think 
[02:44:00]  you're worried though about you know if i get truly sick will there be a diluting i don't think you're  you're not worried about like am i going to be able to get my flu shot right yeah yeah what now  what is your your uh agenda of why you're because usually i'm not i'm a health services researcher  actually what i what i actually do is i do research on how we can improve the health care system how  we finance and how we deliver care overall doctors must be against this doctors hate my our own research  actually we did the most comprehensive work on looking at what doctors think about this and we did 
[02:44:30]  uh survey nine out of ten right 59 of physicians actually would support this more 59 yeah and a  majority of every nine percent which is now no no we surveyed way more than we needed plus or minus  only like one or two percent it's it's absolutely a significant majority of almost every specialty of  of doctors uh actually supports it sounds to me like you're taking a lot of guesses  doctors hate medicare and the reason they were supposed they support it is it would get them paid 
[02:45:00]  some kind of way as opposed to not getting that kind of way that's like doctors if doctors gave a  shit like pre-existent health care right i had to pay for a year before i could actually get help  while they would give you anything i think i thought it's just our health care system is just  i guess but it's not what it should be which is evil you're complaining about private insurance though  that's what you i mean right right and about private insurance but they work hand in hand  private insurance and health care work candidate that's what we're looking at right here we're looking 
[02:45:30]  at uh giving people what people that have private insurance have which is health care right health care  right before you know why people need to use today's eight nine nine we don't have to guess  medicare exists right now they're getting good care but again 65 and over that's the worst that's  what i think it's why i don't understand this part of your argument they're the most expensive group in  the united states and that's who's going to get killed at the end of the day that's what they're trying to  get rid of are useless old people i'm telling you you walk into the doctor's office and they hire someone 
[02:46:00]  who just go boom and hopefully exactly they're trying to get rid of old people man they're really not it's uh  there's no research you did on that one i you you're right i've done no research to see if they're  getting rid of you absolutely i concede the point he's the angel of death  let me actually ask archangel gabriel  is there going to be like those questions that they have like a lot of times you have those  questions you have to answer about uh pre-existing conditions exactly medicare has no pre-existing 
[02:46:30]  conditions you turn 65 you get medicare will it make it harder for me under a nationalized  system to get insurance if say i smoke and have unprotected anal sex through a hole in a people  i'm not saying i've done that i'm much more of a giver than a receiver should that make my insurance be  lower do you pitch it's a lot cheaper than if you catch it oh my god we were so much more serious  about this two hours ago oh my goodness it's like a plea  it makes a lot of sense i mean it's like you know the guy coming from this greedy agenda i mean 
[02:47:00]  and this is i'm just i'd say this again if you just look at every other country and again i there's  no i don't care about the politics of everything else they all have some sort of system that's  really like this where it's nationalized at some level and then there can be private insurance on  top of it but all of them across the board all of them though cover everybody they get outcomes  which are usually the same or better than ours and it costs significant you can't say all the  country though come a doctor in england only has to go to school i should say you're like four years 
[02:47:30]  or something really a doctor they all i've tried a little bit and doctors have less  uh uh credentials than they do in america america is the best the best doctors again i'm not arguing  go from other countries to come here to get well you're right yes but again you're talking about  doctors blue cross and blue shield doesn't create medicines um anthem doesn't create procedures it's like  that's that's health care we're talking about paying the bills patrice is saying people from  other countries come here to get care to get people from here elsewhere to get cheaper care 
[02:48:00]  i mean if there's people crossing the borders and then they die that's the part you're leaving  out i oh i saw this wonderful procedure down in the philippines where the man didn't even use  equipment he just went in and took the tumor out i couldn't believe it what his dirty little  would there be would there be an option would there be an option uh to to see a better doctor  if you had money with the or would you be able to see them with the regular with the regular  insurance doctors would you could see them with the medicare 
[02:48:30]  some don't accept insurance though some don't accept we would have to make it so that they could  accept it but you see we have to make it i want i want to see the best son of a  bitch in the country uh let's say i'm all loaded right and i want to see the best doctor there is  uh that to me that whole thing of competition of being better than the next doctor of being able to  charge more because you are better uh uh kind of fosters uh people doing a better job i believe but 
[02:49:00]  even just across the board we all make the same money uh for every procedure this doctor does the  same procedure as this one this doctor not quite as good as this guy but they both get paid the same  amount then what's his incentive there's though first of all you don't there's lots of different  ways to compensate doctors i mean doctors right now even working under medicare can make different  amounts of money you could work for a hospital it says we want to have the best doctor they pay their  physicians much more and then they collect the medicare rates and they send it through you can still  come up with ways to incentivize people it's not all i'm going to be paid a set amount by the  government that no that's not how much it's cheaper i'm thinking this way uh all right i no longer have 
[02:49:30]  to pay a huge premium every month to my insurance company uh am i going to get the same quality of  care under a free government-run program it's not free nobody ever said the word free all right  nothing is free all right how is it paid for it has to be paid for i mean medicare right now is paid  through through medicare taxes if we want to keep paying the same amount of health care we're paying  right now we would have to take the money that's going to premiums and everything in the private  insurance which really is only about a third of the money out there right now so now paying for two 
[02:50:00]  thirds of care what would you think do you think i'd pay more in taxes or less in premium uh in uh  premium you personally yeah maybe one of the very few that it depends how they set up the tax  structure again i know this is right my but but 99.99 but again we i don't need to make an income  tax there are other ways that we could come up with some sort of tax semantics yeah it's one of those  things where i'm talking face how about if they only did specific like say they only taxed meld the 
[02:50:30]  toast which i have many times written there are ways to do it through a vat or other ways where  they could come up with a different but but for the vast vast vast vast majority of people there's  very little way that any kind of increased tax can come up to be what the cost of insurance then  you're talking here we go now you're talking socialism why because when the wealthy have to pay for the  poor but we've got that right now no we don't you don't think that the income tax happens right now 
[02:51:00]  i mean come on your income you pay more tax than anybody you know what it is though i'm getting  something for it i'm getting and this is why i want my income taxes i love northern state parkway  right now oh it's smooth as silk they repaved it i love it that would not change you're still  i mean right now you're paying for well what i don't want to pay yeah tell me i'm not happy no but  that with that existed ten years ago and there's socialist programs there's social programs there's  social okay okay if you if you define that as socialism then we've been socialist forever 
[02:51:30]  so no no time out of mind we have we have pockets of socialism with with uh various programs but for  health care medicare social yeah of course then you're out there i mean but then okay but then  if you believe now we're already there show no we're we're not quite there oh it could be so much  worse oh i don't disagree with you it could be so much worse and a socialized medicare this  now i am paying what gives me the incentive to achieve the american dream of of uh a little bit 
[02:52:00]  of luck some skill and making something myself the same incentive you have right now yeah that's  to be vilified to be vilified what's the option stay stay poor and so you don't have to pay more taxes  you know something why the fuck am i going 60 40 with the government now at this at that point because  if you make a million yeah and you got to pay uh 400 000 yeah you got 600 000 if i make 60 000 i got  to pay 15 000 but there's there is a point in the teeter-totter that you're talking about where it's 
[02:52:30]  going to be cheaper that's you're damn right i do and i want to keep it i don't want to have to cool  my pull off so somebody could get a tooth pull listen i don't want you to either you won't have  to man i want your money but it's there got to be a way for for for this country to one you know give  people a chance that can't afford decent health care it's an equality of opportunity but you can't  have the goddamn government see it's private industry that ain't shit they just don't they care about 
[02:53:00]  nothing right but that's nothing welcome to america no no no private insurance can't i mean  think about it we talk about innovation we talk about what's the good thing that insurance does  i mean really insurance doesn't create anything it doesn't it doesn't actually invent any new  procedures it doesn't make medicines i'm not talking about demonizing the pharmaceutical industry  it's it's just pushing money around from here to that it's supposed to be there to pay more than you 
[02:53:30]  paid in in case of emergency right except right up front insurance is socialism because it means  that everyone puts money in the pot and no it's not because it's not run by the government and it's  strictly voluntary but it's the opposite of it is voluntary government out of it you put money in  and whoever needs it pulls it out well then it's i mean it's really it's almost more communist because  everybody needs socialism too man this is this is bigger than socialism you're making everything  socialism i'm not so you're trying to yes you're making every example of what we do on our daily 
[02:54:00]  american my view of socialism looks like things that are already out there which isn't true but  i'm when jim when jim pays for a hooker and shares with other people that's not socialism yes when the  government forces us all to use the same hooker that's social right government tells me that i can't  get my money back because it's not in fact the girl that i thought it was that is socialism let's  back up if you believe if you believe that that this i mean do you think medicare is socialism uh 
[02:54:30]  i think it's a social program fine but if i say then just take medicare and drop it to age 64 is that  socialism oh now you're going to say how far down do we go it's just medicare that's what i'm saying  if you believe that medicare is not socialism then why if i say just take medicare and drop the age for  everyone that's that's all i'm saying there are charitable programs in this country okay uh i  wouldn't go as far as to call them socialist no i'm not but socialized medicine would be socialism 
[02:55:00]  it would be because it covers everybody it's not socialized medicine it's just socialized  financing financing but that's what medicare is right now it is i mean we all pay taxes mandated and  we give it to the we give it to the elderly that if you and i'm fine sure i'm fine if you believe  that's social and pills to some old people it's like all right it costs that isn't exactly more  than that isn't exactly stalin uh you know i i'm talking it's it gets into very dangerous ground when  you talk about uh the entire country being under the government umbrella as far as health care goes 
[02:55:30]  it's very i i don't i just don't like the sound of it i don't because i don't like the government  getting involved in what they are now they're running auto industry uh housing banks again  but we're not going to disagree on a lot of stuff i'm i'm not saying government everything  i'm here with you know one thing and one thing only but i've only seen them screw things up over  the years well medicare i haven't can't but but again that's not a big it's you know what a  nationalized health care system what a a a a chore that would be for the government it's just pushing 
[02:56:00]  money it's not the health care it's actually again medicare has far less red tape than any private  insurance company again three percent overhead and the canadian system operates at about 1.6  percent overhead the bigger the pool the less the red tape in the overhead which is why medicare  which is the largest insurer really in the united states operates far more efficiently and with far  less red tape than all the big private insurance companies do now i oh that was a good point right 
[02:56:30]  there hey oh sorry i was just gonna say i guess we're gonna have to agree to disagree that was an  overwhelmingly good point by the doctor the doctor's making some very good points i don't know  enough about a lot i mean i've done my research but it really has fallen on deaf ears maybe you should  go to the doctor because your examples are silly jimmy well no yeah they really are yeah jesus come on  i stood up in congress in a pink shirt i demanded hats for everyone that's for all americans and i raised 
[02:57:00]  the sudan because i do think that burning a village and declitting is a way to help people that's my  opinion people think i'm radical they're not going to take you seriously jimmy no they're not serious  debate right now very serious no i i and i think patrice is right by saying you know he's not even here  what are you talking about that's why he's pinning it on him was patrice never here no no it's people  that are the problem now that he's gone by that i mean heavy right of course thank god we got the  problem out of the room i i i do agree that you do seem like a genuine decent guy that just wants to uh 
[02:57:30]  help people help people out and and get the the most people helped uh for as little uh chore as  is possible for other people but everyone's saying i lost i'm just oh boy oh look at that what holy  shit i'm a high school dropout go fuck yourself well the doctor had what aunt is saying is not a good  point that's all i'm saying what ann is saying is not ridiculous though it's a hit him with something i  think that's point is very valid though about one thing my bullhorn you don't want them just to come in 
[02:58:00]  and continually milking you dry of your money that's what to pay for the entire country and  that's why we should come up with a way that's probably the most fair to pay for it i will always  i'm not saying like tax i'm not saying tax the wealthy i'm not and if you are but you're not in  charge either well first of all i'm not in charge either it's very unlikely they're going to do what  i'm saying anyway i'm that's not my point i'm saying fine find a fair way to pay for it i'm completely  in agreement with you but it would cost less why is it fair in the first place for someone in north  dakota to have to pay for me to get medical care very good why is that fair well i would i mean 
[02:58:30]  want to go back to fair i'd take it back to think that most most people i think when they talk about  freedom can agree that what we're looking for here is an equality of opportunity not everyone's not  going to be the same everyone's not going to make the same amount of money everyone's not going to  succeed the same way but we'd like to believe that everybody has the same fair shot um that's why i  think we have public education that's why we have other things that keep us safe you know because  we just want to keep everybody a fair shot um some the only way to guarantee that equality of 
[02:59:00]  opportunity is also to you know to say that you know we all have a fair shot at decent health  um not that everyone's going to make money but if you get cancer and you have no health insurance  you're done you know you're just not going to have any chance we're just trying to look for a way to  provide health care to every it's not that everybody should get everything but i think health  care is one of those things that the government we should try to provide i don't even disagree with  them on that and it's like you say like what's fair what's not fair and we all do kind of pay  for the same military yeah i mean uh you know we're not all getting the same maybe i mean as  a country we're getting protected by them but it's like there are things that we all kind of pay in 
[02:59:30]  for it's like why do you hate the military jim because i i don't i don't i just think that their  outfits are terrible the black shoes it's just too heavy um no i love them my father's military guy  and now you know don't ask don't tell got him kicked out  no i i uh it's almost like what i'm concerned with is like will all of a sudden the uh like if i  want to go like i had to go to a podiatrist i had a bad ankle and she didn't take insurance she was 
[03:00:00]  very expensive but she was great now would uh uh would she be forced to take medicaid would doctors  be allowed to operate that way anymore they would have to i mean if we went this kind of system they  would all have to take the regular insurance would have for what do her rates have to go down it you  know the rates get a little tricky and the truth of the matter is that um that probably i mean research  has shown if you look at other countries the doctor salaries on average actually stay the same or maybe  go up a bit but there's a there's a shrinking towards the middle um doctors who make a ton of money  sometimes make a bit less but those at the bottom end those who provide primary care and some of the 
[03:00:30]  the services that don't make as much money now because a lot of that's better support  and actually make more money but how much now you're making it sound like see this and this is  what the the tricky part was you're making it sound like the government will dictate what doctors can  make right now you're saying the hospital can hire a doctor and pay them a certain amount of money  yeah uh which is one thing but i i do believe then if the hospital is being paid through a government  program they're not going to have this huge amount of money to then pay uh uh also there's going to be a 
[03:01:00]  lot more beds taken up with a lot less money coming in from uh those beds and the government  again dictating how much money is being paid to these doctors you're not going to get the best  health care that you can get i think some of the points you bring up are valid and you have to be  concerned about that but then we have to try to we have to come up with a payment system which right  now we pay for quantity of care you know the more things you do the more you get reimbursed it's a  crappy way to pay for health care so we need to perhaps pay for better incentives to try to get 
[03:01:30]  people to have better outcomes or to do the right thing as opposed to doing more things most people  will agree to that um and so we have to come up with systems to reward the payment structures the  better doctors to get them paid more why can't we do that what is the way to do that where the  doctors because again don't we have that now they do make that no absolutely not you're you're believe  me your doctor there's no graph of where doctor's quality and doctor's salary match that does not happen  oh i wouldn't you know something probably there are some crappy doctors that make more money than 
[03:02:00]  very good doctors but no but there's no relation there's really no relation there isn't a friggin  wizard heart surgeon guy that is just amazing that can walk into a hospital and they go holy  shit this guy hire him that yeah because he's probably paid by a hospital like i said before like  i said him out it has nothing to do with the reimbursement yes yes but again like i said the  hospitals themselves are going to make their money based on a government check that they are sent  for caring and it's not going to be as much money why as because the patients that go in there 
[03:02:30]  aren't going to be these upper-class patients that are paying for dr wonderful but they're paying the  but you're just i'm saying in other words we know how much money is spent in the health care system  let's just agree to spend that much money are you saying the money's going to go  value into thin air it's going to go to the doctor a hospital in beverly hills okay it's going to have the  same quality of care as one in the south that's not true no well under your idea no no no no no  everyone can have that because there'll be different quality doctors there'll be different  quality hospitals i'm not running the hospitals what's the incentive to go somewhere else i know 
[03:03:00]  you're not running the hospitals i'm saying as a business the hospitals are not going to be able to  afford high uh great like those miracle doctors i hate to tell you but the hospitals right now that  probably are are noted as like the best hospitals are not the hospitals that make the most money  because a lot of them are affiliated with academic institutions a lot of them are university settings  a lot of them are not for profit but there are hospitals that have better survival rates  than other that has nothing to do also with how much that has nothing that's not how much money  they're making i'm not saying that they don't have lots of people have different reasons for wanting 
[03:03:30]  to work at those institutions people don't go to work and say at harvard or some other well  institution because they're going to get paid more often a lot of times it's the notoriety  and because of everything else that how about cedar sinai like a hospital like that they they are  pretty notorious like they probably do better than king was it king's community or king's medical like  like a hospital like that where doctors know they can will the government i'm babbling sure will the dot will the  government cap what a doctor can earn no okay so they won't say no that that hospital that does not  happen under medicare that will not happen okay so that like because anthony was saying that if 
[03:04:00]  the hospital is getting medicaid money or medicare money they may not be in a position to pay say  surgeon x that's just it because they can't do it technically what you're saying is they're not  going to be able to cap it but the circumstance itself is going to be that the hospital is going to be  forced to cap because they're getting well there's a let's be honest there's a cap now there's only so much  money doctors can make it's not an unlimited pool exactly by ten million dollars no one it just  doesn't happen of course there's a cap because you know how much you can get paid by it by this  insurance you know how much the overhead is it's a business like anything else exactly but it's a 
[03:04:30]  business but i'm saying so fund it so that the amount of money going into the system is exactly  the same as it is now if the same amount of money is going into the system and the same doctors are  practicing the same money is available for it but it's getting divvied up no no it's getting divvied up  by the patients but still going to the same number of doctors splitting up the same amount of money  how much let me ask you a question how much would malpractice insurance change was being run by  the government well malpractice insurance there's two reasons malpractice insurance would change  first is a lot of what gets paid out in malpractice claims is actually your future care and maybe it  accounts for about half of claims you know there's always the big case of punitive damages but most 
[03:05:00]  cases are like i'm going to need care for the rest of my life this is what it costs you owe it to me  if the rest of your care was already covered by medicare or government system that part of the  malpractice goes away completely how much did the doctor i'm sorry how much do doctors pay  roughly the average doctor for malpractice insurance so variable but i mean you know it depends if you're  an ob-gyn in a bad place it could be fifty hundred i mean it's insane what's what's what's a what's a  what's a fairly average rate that most most most health health care providers would pay you know i  hesitate to i say only because i just don't know the number off the top of my head but it's it's a lot of 
[03:05:30]  money thirty thousand we'll believe you yeah yeah i mean that could be is it over four hundred  dollars a year we're going to start there and work our way up yes but it's actually right away you're  going to lose half of the things we can then with then only reason to bring malpractice cases would  be for punitive damages we could set up a new system the other reason is if we could pass some  law we've discussed before defense and medicine it accounts for eighty ninety billion dollars a year 
[03:06:00]  yeah if we could if we could drop that down that would save us some money too it's not  insignificant amount of money it would actually cover a fair amount of the uninsured and we can  work on that too but yes this would absolutely works to bringing malpractice premiums down i'm just  i'm just thinking of the the the basic american maybe i'm a traditionalist my friend or just an  asshole you're just a dreamer but i am i i'm just thinking of the basic american dream of the fact that  if you do and i don't care how organized crime luck skill however you acquired your cash in this 
[03:06:30]  country that affords you the ability to get better things and and i think health care i think you'll  still find a way i think you'll still find a way in some back alley abortion at a boy  because that money will bring with relationships and knowledge and you'll get into the clinic you want  it will it still happens today i i no i i don't see that happening i i see that as being one of these  we're spreading it out we're spreading it thin and evenly i got it and i'm not feeling that i would 
[03:07:00]  be able to get the best care my money could buy me your money i'm not on your ability to get the  best doctor everything else is not today realistically related to how much money you have in your bank  you know like do you know someone to get you into the clinic do you have a personal relationship  um do you know that's the stuff that sort of matters i kind of know i kind of know if i get an  illness yeah i'm not going to the south bronx i'm not going to bed stye but you i'm going i'm going 
[03:07:30]  to it manhasset yes i'm going to uh uh roslin i got it i'm going to that area nassau county  did you just say the jew area i'm going to every jew area could could we get medicaid to cover his  visit to kevorkian is that possible  god damn jimmy norton well you know something um like i said nice enough guy i think but i don't 
[03:08:00]  think we're ever going to agree on this sir i think that's probably true and i hope i win in the end  but what the doctor's saying is not as radical as i thought either like shut up you lefty oh no  well you see you're just a part of the machine man but no we do think like socialized  gatekeeper shut up gatekeeper  uh we we think socialized uh medicine  all right 
[03:08:30]  guy who doesn't know where he's going that's my new character guy has no idea what point  do you really well actually why don't we promote the book because we got chris and davis standing  by too dr aaron carroll the book is called don't swallow your gum myths half truths and outright  lies about your body and health anything good this is cool let me let me read a couple of these green  mucus points to a sinus infection is this true yes it is no it's totally not true points to an untasty  snack all right let me try guys i'm a i'm actually a huge fan of the show i actually listen

[03:11:00]  you can't shut down religion the big giant water slides are just nude and men at the end look at that  paint shooting a roman candle out of his anus well guys we inspired a book so is that what's another  comment what's another one all right let's try one let me try to get one okay uh let's see well  here's what men with big feet have bigger penises yeah you'd be shocked they actually studied this  they've actually done even studies where they they do stretch penile length i don't know who volunteer 
[03:11:30]  for wow so they actually measure the feet measure the penis tons of people there's no relationship  whatsoever because i got a nice size hog and i only got nine nine and a half i'll say you do thank  you jimmy i appreciate it oh boy and i actually have sure okay yourself brother thank you all right  i'm not particularly well endowed but it's been called more delicious than one would expect  now singles have better sex lives than married couples yeah that's actually a myth and it says now  i've read this let me let me let me add a little of my reason yeah tell me about let me add a little bit 
[03:12:00]  of my reasoning in here you say married couples report more sex more orgasms and more instances  of giving and receiving oral pleasure yes now this is probably i would say it probably true yeah you  know you studied it but singles it says singles have better sex lives than married couples more does not  necessarily mean better all right this is this is more sex orgasms and oral pleasures with the same  rag you've been with for years do you know how special it is when a brand new girl touches your wee 
[03:12:30]  week oh i don't care how many times it's done it's that quality i'm coming you dumb  roll over and shut up exactly where do you live doctor uh indianapolis no you don't  yeah i know but you leave me i have trouble believing it too  uh-huh you go to 500 i've never been been living there six years and we still haven't gotten down there  well i hear it's a big shindig you have anything else to say mr wanking yes i'm a loyal colts fan 
[03:13:00]  thank you that's an injustice for all reference it's like us though we don't go to the empire  state buildings right down the street you say you should poop at least six times a day is that  that can't be right where we are with the typo in your uh yeah yeah i do i do three a day is that  good oh my god that's quite a bit actually yes you're very good that's healthy three  that's fine fewer stools per week is diagnosed as chronic constipation that the idea though is that  everybody panics that they got to be going every day and if they don't go every day somehow  something's wrong how many a week every day is pretty good three weeks is fine but actually 
[03:13:30]  you can certainly do more than that as long as you know every day actually um and i would say at  least four a week make the bowl the other three well i should have planned better you know how it is  now when the when the government's running health care will they be keeping track of how many times a  day yeah well they won't be involved in that kind of stuff they'll be bagging up your logs will  there'll be cameras in the toilet well i have my way you can only hope he also says that milk uh  doesn't make you phlegmy doesn't come on they've done double blinded studies where they give people 
[03:14:00]  they don't know what they're getting and it makes no difference it also makes no difference for the  particles it's in your head maybe not for blind people if i drink milk i guarantee i start going  people will say that if i give you two different substances and i don't tell you what they are most  people can't tell which jimmy stop drinking out of a mule oh what do you mean oh yeah exactly so  what is it that makes me clear my throat a lot like that i didn't actually get that i don't give oral  sex to men so no i don't why don't you explain all right can we sit no so um what what is it about 
[03:14:30]  that because it drives me it drives me and forgive my language it could be like post-nasal drip i do  have that but i had sinus surgery it's better since then well i mean but is it still like you're still  having post-nasal drip i don't know probably jimmy if you're still having a problem he's gonna  charge you if you're no i'm a pediatrician i'm not gonna charge him for that oh so why should we  read this why should we read this book i think that you know you're gonna find that there's a  lot of stuff that people have told you's true and it's just absolutely not that is actually 
[03:15:00]  cool i like the idea yeah you can't get pregnant using the pull-out method that's a  myth of course you can right yes that one is one of those what wish ixnay sorry how about this is  the best method this is the best method leave it in and give them a wrong last name doc you  shouldn't have that in your book i'm pretty sure it's not you really shouldn't have that in your  book kind of violates the bro code doesn't it but it does prove that we inspired you to write  the book yes now that's that's fantastic this looks phenomenal this book actually flying on a plane 
[03:15:30]  is dangerous for your unborn baby is that actually a myth it's not totally a myth and they  the people the worry is sort of that one people always used to worry about what if the plane crashes  your unborn baby but uh it's not dangerous in terms of uh you know the air or anything else did  we get a mention in your book you know you didn't and i apologize most people give us a mention in  their book doc i should have now that i look i'll be so embarrassing to be around when we have guests  like this could you ask you you give comments and questions that i cringe at because you say you 
[03:16:00]  say we're all thinking you have the audacity to say what i want to say and you weren't curious to  no of course i want to be you like seeing your name in print just like i do where where's our  not usually i'll tell you what we're going to the next print if they can let me change the  acknowledgements we're not even in the acknowledgements that's what i want get out the average  person swallows eight spiders a year not true that's a myth how many spiders does the average 
[03:16:30]  person swallow a year probably zero okay good doc doc i've spent millions for no reason five spider  nets for my mouth to protect me boo you kind of hurt all our feelings for you know we really wanted to  be in the book and we inspired the uh the writing of this book could you at least apologize for us not  being in the book i do apologize all right thank you uh now uh this is very you know cold cold weather  yes uh and and getting sick getting a cold totally not true no i understand because it's a virus so you  you know but again they've done it's amazing because you'd be surprised when people subject 
[03:17:00]  research they've actually chilled people or made them wet and then injected live viruses into their  nose and there's no difference all right now why though does it seem that you everyone gets sick  in the winter you get sick in the winter there's probably two reasons why i already know the people  if they're cold or wet will often report symptoms more than otherwise the second is that when it's cold  we happen to spend sometimes a lot more time indoors and around other people and we're probably  transmitting viruses yeah but is it no one more question could you tell us doc when this old  fuck's gonna die yeah there's a man walking down the hall who has what i would call supple bosom 
[03:17:30]  is that healthy probably not should he move to canada if he has a problem  oh you saw him though doc he laughed he actually laughed he is a he is a fan of the show so um  i was just testing him i'm still not in the book i miss little nicky i'm very i know little nicky's  great although he's starting to not look like little nicky anymore he's changed his whole look  because he's very slowly morphing into some uh other character oh but getting colds uh do you get 
[03:18:00]  well i always think you have more colds in the winter because your body is trying to heat you and  the things that would normally fight infection are heating that's a myth no that's a myth part of the  reason is that viruses are seasonal so a lot of the viruses that will cause colds happen to be in  higher levels sometimes in the winter months that's all it is yeah it has nothing to do with the  weather whatsoever and is it true that you never get the same strain of cold twice you would never  get the same exact virus right because yeah you build up an immunity it's like there are some viruses  you can't you know you build an immunity but you don't ever kick like you know you get chicken pox 
[03:18:30]  that virus is always in your body um but yeah that's how people get zoster or you know stuff like  that really shingles shingles it's reactivation that's what nixon had i think a jew gave it to  me anti-semite but uh yeah but you yeah you get virus you get in you get immune to it so you you  you you uh what kind of doctor are you like what did you i'm a pediatrician but again i spent most  of my time actually doing doing research so i'm at what's called a health services so now as a  pediatrician do you have like a probably a hell of an immune system because kids just come in coughing  your face all day you probably never get sick you'd think i seem to get every virus oh do you really 
[03:19:00]  i don't know what that is swine flu it's probably actually i really don't we can use that much i  like uh you know i don't see patients that often our good friend andy levy here was very ill and uh  he believes it was a a a swine flu and let me ask you a question are they are they not diagnosing the  swine flu as the swine flu to keep stats down go down no because the truth is the swine people like  get so got so freaked out by the swine yeah influenza every year just regular old influenza  is far more dangerous than the swine flu it kills a lot more people way more people exactly 
[03:19:30]  way more infected way more people dying are you belittling my swine flu i'm not i'm just saying  are you saying that he was looking for sympathy when he was running around  the doctor told me i had the doctor told me i had swine i believe i didn't just  i don't think you do i totally believe you oh things get rather heated here in the morning  gets kind of crazy where's kristen davis i want to get her in and see what she's gonna get her  i'm fairly sexually attracted to her let's get rid of this boy  i happen to like this doctor very much i did the colbert how was that that was a lot of fun

[03:26:00]  shit market the market so you were the manhattan madam and what is this article about in penthouse  uh it's about wall street misappropriated spending you know the antics of uh the guys spending the  money doing cocaine spending the corporate money taking it out of people's pockets still doing coke  still it's huge come on whoever didn't move on to heroin's a pussy why is it or at least math  yeah yeah go to math something coke is so 80s why is your article only two and a half pages i don't 
[03:26:30]  know why did you get your picture my picture's not in there and i think i'm kind of cute damn  because they were making fun of us obviously they picked the worst picture ever taken of us  you uh i don't know there's quite page 51 really bad ones to choose from what was the name of your  agency your escort agency wicked models wicked models and you said uh one of the people you name is uh  you name bernie madoff is one of the guys that's correct was he frequent how much money was he  spending he was a body rub client so he wasn't on the high end 20 billion dollars i've taken 
[03:27:00]  everyone's money and now they're gonna come find me body rub what's a body rub rub and tug yeah but  he would probably get more if he would how much would he spend average you know like what was a  body rub 220 that's it do you think you'd ever throw them more for blowjob whatever because i'm sure  many times i'm sure if you like the girl but body rub safe like you can go in for a couple hundred bucks  if you like her you can coerce her for more you don't have to pay agencies fees you really get a  discount actually that way okay and the last time you were in we didn't be such a saver 
[03:27:30]  what a cheap yeah for all that money yeah his uh office was two doors down from my location  did you know him no i didn't personally know him i'm sorry all the offshore uh all the body rub calls  were handled offshore offshore which means i had an offshore call fire island  as far as i could go staten island yes that's interesting too so what did that kept it safe for  you they're calling somewhere else um it was cheaper i mean i was paying these girls in new 
[03:28:00]  york ten percent of the gross of a call so if it's a thousand bucks they got a hundred dollars oh you and  your socialized prostitution enough already get that doctor back in here you know you can go over  to uh uruguay and it's about 350 a month for somebody's salary with a master's degree that  speaks perfect english so i had eight people over there you didn't do any bait and switch did you  i've had that happen a couple of times all i did was bait and switch that's the art of it but if you're  good at it if you're good at it you will never know well did you ever get guys who sent i sent one 
[03:28:30]  girl back but i was nice about it well no she didn't have one i was like what is this you're  missing something you're incomplete no she one girl came over and i wanted this little sexy blonde  and they sent me this kind of a hefty hawaiian it was really awful and uh but i was not going to  tony rocky hara i uh i gave her up i gave her some money just for massage i gave her money just for uh  for a cab but then i showed her i'm like this is the girl i called and then she's like yeah they do 
[03:29:00]  that's like she knew that they kind of tried to me out of it yeah well i mean there's art to bait  and switch if you're going to bait and switch is she better resemble the photo you know with long  hair and you see panties and heels from the back you don't know what you know so that let me tell  you something i've looked at pictures on craigslist and gone wow that's a girl i wouldn't mind having  over here but knowing damn well that girl ain't showing up some asian girl's going to show up or some  hispanic lady or a black guy is showing up at the door it's not going to be it's not going to be 
[03:29:30]  this hot blonde girl what do you mean it's not gonna be that it's just not gonna be it's never  it never look there that's who's gonna and she ain't even showing up a nice little anime girl that  might show up she's not showing up if they're showing her face chances are she's not showing  no huh oh really but the pictures aren't always you know completely misrepresented you know sometimes if  you do it right if you do bait and switch right i'm going to send you someone i over promise  under deliver you know patrick swasey's brother looked like patrick swasey but you knew it wasn't 
[03:30:00]  patrick swasey when frank salone shows up yeah exactly you know it's not sly now what about um uh  michelle uh she was uh what was the name of her agency she's uh she was in fort lauderdale she actually  gave me one for free one time um nieces girls i think they were called um oh yeah um but you know  who i'm talking about she had some pretty high end uh were you kind of on that level with her  sure sure but i think bigger i had you know boston philly dc three apartments in new york la 
[03:30:30]  miami as well and now now you said spitzer was one of your clients she held all the prostitutes  in a pocket like so many nickels and dimes yeah she went to jail for the spitzer thing  i spent four months in rikers island yeah we missed the the a-rod story she was in  literally the day before she told the world you know disclaimer i did not we're over it  trust me or you wouldn't be here yes but give us some info on a-rod and the hookers and you dated  him uh personally no you didn't date him um there was a friendship there i didn't date him maybe a 
[03:31:00]  crush did he uh okay did you guys ever watch dinner together um we went out in public together yes okay  you hung out a little bit um would he ever give you gifts as a friend sure uh would they be cash  gifts would they be uh just the jewelry or she went to the game saw the fence and got an autograph  that pretty much sums up the relationship i found in running an agency once you say i don't care who  the client is once you say yes then they feel uncomfortable calling back and asking for another  girl and then if you say no they feel rejected so you have to walk the fine line of just being a big 
[03:31:30]  flirt so if a client calls up and says hey i'm interested in you know booking a girl oh you  sound really cute oh you know what you yeah i am but you know you really wouldn't like me i'm not  that much fun so you just keep saying no without saying no but you went out with it let's be honest  maybe for me you do but for a guy who's got a 200 million dollar contract that's that's a guy  probably who was at least you know you must have slept i mean i know it's okay no i didn't sleep  come on you never bang day rod come on you can say if you did have a little there's a hesitation of 
[03:32:00]  question hesitation no i'm not gonna say that he's not a extremely attractive man but i had a boyfriend at  that time and i'm not a cheater so i don't care who you are i wouldn't have done it give us some  sign uh sign language boyfriend derek cheater did you have any uh did you have a make out with him  no you ever touch his hog no i never touched his hog are you like a madame brood  you know what it's it was business so it was not personal there's a different you know there's a 
[03:32:30]  madame and then there's a christian so they're two different yes yes so why would he go out with  uh a madame who wasn't gonna gonna give him any type of sexual activity i bring she was bringing  the girls i i get that part so okay why probably maybe it's a dumb question but why someone like a  rod needs hookers when he could bang any pretty much any groupie out there discretion they don't  get attached discretion you pay him to leave yeah you pay him to leave it's the truth it is true 
[03:33:00]  you know i'm just sick of hearing that sorry it's your under variety i mean it's easy it is you don't  have to work for it so at the end of the day when you're tired and you just want to do what you want  to do you can make a call and it's there in two seconds you don't have to go out you don't  you know you can be in your pajamas it's great did the girls give you good reviews on a-rod  um oh what's his problem what was the negative review that you heard one of the girls didn't  were from out of the country he was great in april but horrible in september 
[03:33:30]  wait wait there was too much going on there and he was great in april lunch but horrible  in september and what what are you laughing at it there's so much going on that's what it was i  was just ready to go the girls that fucked him in october i know we all were girlfriends  yeah yeah we bang heads what were some of the reports you got that were that were  less than stellar they were not less than stellar they were just um you know two of the girls didn't  know who it was they're from out of the country they didn't recognize him screw them um and one 
[03:34:00]  of the other girls her father's actually a coach for a major league team so she freaked out when she  saw him so she was she's an escort and her father is what kind of a coach um baseball major league  pitching coach is he a manager or is he he's a pitching coach okay and um america internationally  you don't have to get any more which i know which team was that i missed it yeah what's it rhyme  with the team i don't know why i'm with pets i know nothing about sports i have to think for 
[03:34:30]  a second i know i'm full hankies oh oh we gotta ask her about um i think joseph brooks i think is  his name oh yes mr brooks he uh he's been in the paper he's the dude uh that wrote uh oh help me out  you light up my life thank you all right he uh 91 counts on his indictment 12 women three-year  period of assault rape yeah all these first-degree felonies but his bail was less than mine  oh really wow that's fair right 500 000 versus two million you knew him in this world sure about 150 
[03:35:00]  appointments really how much an appointment 14 1500 an appointment for an hour wow do i  he was a complete crackhead complete crackhead did a whole like excessive drugs three or four  day binges had the girls read scripts um saying like they're auditioning for his next film that  he's doing complete black job and he would rape the girls or no no he didn't rape my girls um 
[03:35:30]  he just tried to have sex to rape a girl you paid for sex well i'm saying he's charged with rape right  so i'm saying was it was actually he's well he's charged with rape but his assistant used to go  out on craigslist and find women that they were for auditioning for parts and then bring them over  to the apartment it's pretty silly probably read the same script my girls read saying oh joe i want  to have sex with you without a condom i'm in love with you blah blah blah blah and the girl's saying  this and he's trying to get them to believe it and then they come to do the act and he wants to do 
[03:36:00]  without a condom and then there's some sort of you know verbal discussion mm-hmm and they usually call me  or you know depends on the level of girl that i send him if it's a really hot girl he doesn't  want her to leave so he's not going to pull any bs how much how do you have so much money was it  from that one song you light up my life one song jesus song that was played eight billion times  the song was made into a movie debbie boone who was it yeah no debbie boone debbie boone's daughter 
[03:36:30]  debbie boone i wonder if he got her and he was just a real creep obviously  now we don't know where to go with this governor x we're hearing things hearing things about yeah  so am i governor what do you what do you hear there's a governor another governor not elliot  spitzer not the governor but we know not mcgreevy no no we definitely know that definitely not david  patterson she she is saying he went down on your toilet bowl cover she is saying there's another 
[03:37:00]  governor ladies and gentlemen really now what did this other governor enjoy engaging in um  can't really talk about that why not not even what he likes why can't you talk like you're not  saying his name straight sex ball jobs but also a little let's say entertainment um  you know going out actually for drinks with the girls it was a whole night sort of affair  to pay for that yeah i i just i don't understand it but how would he go out with them in public 
[03:37:30]  money fuck me as a governor how would he go how would he get away with going out with them in  public and not being he had a friend with him okay so he would bring a friend his friend would book  the appointments for him and then it was so they did the bait and switch on me his friend was president  x his friend's actually uh yeah his wife is secretary of  former president x so why are you uncomfortable with with with the governor talking about the 
[03:38:00]  governor without well the last governor fall put me in rikers for four months and seized all of my  assets and then put me in about another three hundred thousand dollars of debt so how did that happen  because you got arrested for it right yes but you've also kind of done your time for it happened  you for being a madam yes i have done my time so how can they prosecute you again for it i don't know  they can prosecute whomever they want for whatever they want they can create something is what i've  found so this well this governor's still in office still in office what's your favorite baseball 
[03:38:30]  uh chicago cubs chicago governor is it is the governor um i don't know is the governor  i will say it's not arnold how's that that's cool we got 49 to go all right all right we're doing  good but i have to defend my home state you know how it goes is it um okay so we get a region of  the country yeah it's a democrat republican yeah are you going to be identifying this guy tomorrow  after you're off our show no i'm not identifying this guy at all though i hear that there are some 
[03:39:00]  you know nice uh blog postings and comments on the huffington post is it east is it northeast or  southeast just east it's northeast let's be honest with each other yeah you're not you're not the guy  no no there's a lot of stuff going on though a lot of interesting conversation about let's just say  this have you seen anything that was written anywhere that did peg him accurately yes  okay do you have a pencil i have a pen are we doing sudoku i need a pencil i don't know sudoku yeah 
[03:39:30]  thank you i just needed a pencil what you could do like hey man that's not a pencil that's a pen  you wanted to do the crossword you're so vain yeah i know and i spelled it wrong 
[03:40:00]  do you have an eraser doesn't mean anything  doesn't yeah so how long for how long did this particular governor whoever it is use your service  about a year and a half and how many times would you say that he uh  how many times would you say he engaged in uh prostitution  probably ten or so ten or so and how much pop fifteen hundred um 
[03:40:30]  um how to say this without saying this it was um obviously fifteen hundred is new york rate so  outside of new york rates vary uh what are the rates let's just say let me ask you a question  the rates of new york about fifteen hundred what are the rates in new jersey  it's about seven eight hundred what are the rates in pennsylvania  about the same a seven eight hundred okay this gentleman paid in coal and steel  so it kind of goes okay so 
[03:41:00]  um so it kind of goes out like when you when you get to the smallest states and as you go north  state of connecticut would it say that the wikipedia it's usually right around the seven  joining the phone  so maybe okay so this guy got about uh ten times he used your service and uh he just pretty much  likes straight sex was there anything weird i'm sure you got some kind of reports on him  um you know more of the reports were about the bait and switch you know you think the appointments 
[03:41:30]  with one person and then all of a sudden you get baited and switched and you know you have to  wonder why so you do a little investigating find out okay well how did you find out who the person  was did you because obviously he wouldn't give his real name would he um yeah actually he did i mean  you're out in public so obviously you know people will come up to him and shake his hand you know  talk to him that sort of level so usually some girls are so um dumb that um you know they just don't  really put two and two together but luckily i managed at least once to send him someone who figured 
[03:42:00]  out what the deal was now so so basically she was out with this governor who had a  friend with him and it may look like it was the friend's date the friend yes the friend would  book everything initially meet the girl and then bait and switch later on and then the governor  would take her upstairs for an hour would he spend the night a couple of hours okay would  he do it in his home state or other states home state yeah gotta like the balls on the governor  yeah that's pretty good all right so you think he's feeling the heat that uh maybe he's been 
[03:42:30]  named a little bit here and there although not here of course i mean we don't know i would love  to know i would say who he was if i thought i knew i just don't know um yeah i mean you know it doesn't  come as a shock right i mean look at spitzer he was frequenting services in his home state  that's true but he wasn't really going out was he going out in public with them  um where's that pencil was he a nice guy who which one the governor x governor x was very nice 
[03:43:00]  yeah you know which is why one of the reasons why i'm sort of keeping quiet is because i don't feel  like he spitzer obviously he's a big hypocrite the girls that were sent over did they ever uh uh steal  her heart it's a fair question i mean uh you know happen maybe if you know hey look you know if  if he uh if he was no but you know what if he would yeah if he would steal her heart she may  leave the business and i think it's it's good that he didn't yes exactly yeah yeah because you don't 
[03:43:30]  want a relationship no all of a sudden you don't need some guy just acting like a pirate taking these  fucking chicks out of your business right aren't most governors married so what are they really going  to do yeah i know you're right married yeah and then you got a nice little filly on the side like that  oh man three there's no problem there without a fucking doubt man yeah i think we're about done  there you bet we are we are running out of show aren't we oh boy yeah we got you in late unfortunately 
[03:44:00]  we're literally running out of show here um are you going to be in the new movie we didn't ask you  that yet what movie what movie sex in the city you're kristin davis no i'm sure she's very off uh  put off by that actually yeah i'm very good can you uh you know the ex-con all right so is this  governor gonna get busted is this governor gonna get busted do you think is it going to come out that 
[03:44:30]  he was doing this because now i think i think it needs to be addressed i think there are some blog  comments that you know i'm hearing some rumors about people really putting two and two together  about the girl even being named potentially coming out so how does his name start getting mentioned  even um i haven't read anything i've heard that this guy has been named how did he start getting  named people posting news speculation on blog on like the huffington post comments there's like 100 
[03:45:00]  250 comments and people are saying i think it's so and so i think it's so and so and now news reporters  are you know picking that up and looking into backgrounds and i mean people in your home  state know your proclivities you know they really know what you're you're about they're just waiting  for the opportunity for someone else to name you that way they can jump all over the story without  any legal liability so i'm sure people are just waiting for this annie to come forward okay here we go  did the relationship ever get a little rocky 
[03:45:30]  that's a fair question that's a fair question i just want it in  i just want to be part of the club hey you know what that's a very fair question  have you even been listening that's a very fair question of course but i you know  it's going to just be a part of why not it's going to be a part of something what's the governor  an eagle scout who the 
[03:46:00]  fuck knows do you think do you think it will come out there'll be proof of it or just even more  speculation that he denies i mean he's got to deny you know i mean what are the look at what  happened to spitzer he denies or resigns basically so he's gonna deny um but it's you know how many  girls has he seen if they all want to come forward well what are you going to do go up against  you know 10 12 20 who you know i mean maybe potentially you've even had relationships with  you know publicists and interns and all these other people in your work environment so are there 
[03:46:30]  actresses and stuff working now or high profile models who are at one time let's just say on the  other side of the business of course really of course how do you think they support themselves  before they get to be of someone's stature let's name one yeah yeah that'll work  what state is she from it's gotta it's there even you know what i even had girls working for me i  won't be specific because i obviously want to protect them but that were in like soap opera stars 
[03:47:00]  and they still i don't know if it's you know their fetish classy enough to be soap stars you know i mean  with their i'm like wait you're on you have a reoccurring role on you know x what are you doing  x of our x some of them i think that you're all looking for the x and the x now would which would  that how much would the soap star get is she a soap star fucking or is she before she was a soap  star both okay so as a soap star how much is she getting for sex 76 dollars more than that 
[03:47:30]  all right now you slip one like two to 2500 an hour it depends on if she allows me to send out  real photos if she allows me to say who she is you know i can command more money obviously yeah how  about uh more mainstream actresses um there are a few what are they getting an hour um about three  three thousand but you know usually you try to what you do is you say okay she has a minimum 
[03:48:00]  so if you want to book her it's a minimum of five hours so she's getting it's a minimum fifteen  thousand well how how mainstream of an actress are you talking about it thousand um i have a girl  i had a girl that's in a major motion picture very very pretty from blonde or brunette  do you still have uh contact with any of these girls sure sure a few a handful a handful i mean most of  of them i think some of them my top girls this is a sign ratted me out in my secret grand jury
