<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing critique of Rachel Jeantel's testimony in the George Zimmerman trial.  The hosts and their unidentified co-host relentlessly mocked Jeantel's demeanor, intelligence, and credibility, using offensive language and referencing numerous listener tweets expressing similar sentiments, some with racial undertones.  This discussion transitioned into a detailed examination of Aaron Hernandez’s arrest for murder, speculating on his motives, referencing a strip club visit and possible infidelity as potential triggers.  The hosts discussed the evidence, including a rental car and unusual bubblegum, and a caller added information about a pending shooting case involving Hernandez.  The conversation then abruptly shifted to the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage ruling, with the hosts jokingly lamenting increased wedding attendance obligations and commenting on CNN's coverage.  Jenny Hutt, a commentator from Dr. Drew's show, called in and engaged in a heated debate with the hosts about the Zimmerman trial and media bias, echoing the show's already prevalent use of racial slurs and offensive language.

Colin Quinn joined the show in studio, promoting his one-man show, "Unconstitutional."  The conversation then focused on the Paula Deen controversy, the hosts heavily criticizing Matt Lauer's interview with her and discussing perceived double standards regarding the use of racial slurs.  They then discussed a home invasion video showing a brutal assault on a white woman by a black man in front of her child, expressing outrage over the lack of media attention compared to other racially charged incidents.  This segment also featured Bert Marcus, promoting his documentary "How to Make Money Selling Drugs," detailing its content and interviews with figures like Freeway Rick Ross, 50 Cent, and Eminem, alongside a tangent about 50 Cent's Vitamin Water success.  The hosts again returned to the Rachel Jeantel testimony, with Bill Burr calling in to share his thoughts.  The hosts also reminisced about bringing their recurring characters "Lady Di" and "Marion" to the MTV Video Music Awards.  An upcoming appearance by Lady Di and Marion was mentioned.  The discussion throughout this portion of the show was saturated with racial slurs and other offensive language.

The show continued with Colin Quinn discussing a woman resembling Patrice O’Neal, followed by further commentary on Paula Deen.  Quinn also briefly discussed his role in *The Heat*. The conversation then veered back to Aaron Hernandez's arrest and became increasingly vulgar and rambling.  The arrival of Penthouse cover models Natalya and Natasha Star dramatically shifted the show's focus to a sexually explicit discussion of their bodies, sexual experiences, and photoshoot, involving significant crude humor and physical contact with the hosts.  The hosts also lamented their failed attempts to get a picture with Miley Cyrus, who had visited the studio earlier that day, a recurring theme throughout this segment. The segment concluded with the sisters' departure and a brief mention of upcoming appearances by Lady Di and Marion.

Finally, the show delved into a humorous and sexually explicit discussion centered around Roland's repeated cancellations of planned activities involving massage parlors and lap dances.  The hosts speculated on Roland's motivations, offering various comedic and often absurd explanations, including depression, discomfort with the environment, lack of confidence, a hidden dislike of Troy, repressed homosexuality, or a fear of unleashing pent-up rage after a massage.  Colin Quinn again contributed anecdotes, and Bob Kelly was mentioned. A photo of a young Colin Quinn was shown and discussed. Callers participated in the conversation.  The hosts ended the segment by brainstorming a show idea about interpersonal relationships inspired by Troy and Roland's dynamic, maintaining the show's irreverent and sexually explicit tone.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m. and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So, flash you in.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Woo!  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn the ground.  Would you like romance?  I'm not a pizza girl.  Wow!  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Petty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horns should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double gun, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We got lots to talk about today. 
[00:02:00]  Hey, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, peoples.  Hi, peel, please.  I got to admit to Anthony that I'm finally in on this Zimmerman thing. 
[00:02:30]  Dude.  It took a while, but I'm finally in.  I'm all in, matter of fact.  You know, as long as Rachel Jantel or...  Jantel.  Jantel.  Rachel Jantel.  What?  She's sassy.  What?  She's sassy.  I have to come back here for you.  For you.  For you.  Wow, I'm in.  I made popcorn yesterday.  It was so damn good.  I can only imagine the court stenographer in the fetal position in a shower after that trial 
[00:03:00]  just washing, saying, I can't wash at all.  Scrubbing really hard.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking arthritic fingers.  They're talking to Roland.  And I also know, well, I understand what you go through a little bit.  Oh, Jesus.  Because I don't have, obviously, you know, people know, I don't have a strong opinion on  this case.  Sure.  Like you.  I mean, you're certainly carrying us through this.  I'm in it, of course, for the, you know, the self-defense thing, the gun issues, and 
[00:03:30]  there are some racial issues that I think come into play here, some hypocrisies that I  like pointing out.  This is all in your wheelhouse, sir.  I'm in there.  Right, exactly.  But I'm now in.  But, you know, I try to make a couple little jokes, and then they come.  Sure.  Wow, they come after you.  You can't joke about these people.  And then I decided not to go back at them like you do.  I was like, oh, yeah.  I'm all in.  Because I've also made the George Zimmerman fat joke. 
[00:04:00]  Of course.  But if you make a joke, then they think, oh, okay, that means you're for this.  I'm like, all right.  No, I'm just making jokes.  I'm trying to just try to make a joke or two.  So, you know, the one thing that got a lot of people pissed on my Twitter yesterday,  I said, I would love to know what she's thinking about while she makes believe she knows how  to read.  And people will write this, you know, with the dramatic fucking arrows or bullshit this.  Racist.  Oh, I got that, too.  Of course you're a racist.  I'm like, you're trying to tell me that this broad knows how to read. 
[00:04:30]  You're a crazy person.  It was so obvious she was, like, making believe she knew how to read up there.  This, of course, is Rachel Jantel.  This is the girl.  The star witness.  The star witness for the prosecution.  The girl that was on the phone with Trayvon Martin when there was some type of altercation  between Trayvon and George Zimmerman.  Well, some friend she is because she thinks she's wasting her time.  She doesn't want to be there. 
[00:05:00]  If you're such a friend of Trayvon Martin and you're helping to get justice for Trayvon  Martin, you sit your ass down there and you don't get all pissed off because it's taking  too long.  She didn't know that George Zimmerman hadn't been arrested.  She didn't attempt to contact the police department.  She's the last person to speak to him.  She didn't attempt to contact the police.  She didn't attempt to contact the family.  This is a friend.  She didn't go to the wake. 
[00:05:30]  She didn't go to the funeral.  She lied about where she was.  She lied about her age at the time.  She had an interview with ABC News.  All this is the star with its end wrapped up in a package of ignorance and belligerence  and contempt for everything that's going on in that courtroom.  You've got to imagine a jury watching this woman testify is disgusted with her attitude  in this whole thing. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, my God.  She's completely impeachable as far as her credibility goes.  And a jury has to look at this and be like, this is their star witness.  She's the one we're supposed to base what the last moments of Trayvon's life were like.  And we can't believe her.  I was just looking at it as pure comedy.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  I couldn't believe what I was watching.  I couldn't believe it.  With that sliver of tar paper on the front of her head as a hairdo. 
[00:06:30]  It looked like what they put under shingles.  Why was she wearing a neck pillow in court?  That's a little weird.  Oh, my God.  That fucking neck pillow is that.  Why was she wearing that?  You couldn't understand what she was saying.  And then.  She's a star.  Oh, man.  Fucking.  She is a star today.  Why is she in the paper?  They buried it a little bit.  Why do you think she could?  Why would they bury it?  I saw.  Star witness on the stand.  Why would they bury it?  They buried it a little bit. 
[00:07:00]  It's buried in one of the papers.  I finally saw, you know.  And the mainstream media, as far as headline news goes, and fucking MSNBC, and fucking.  What's her name?  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Which one?  Tell me.  Fucking.  Mad Al.  No, no.  Miko.  Mike Go.  No.  Crying pissy fucking bitch.  Wait.  Paula Deen?  No.  Wait.  I tapped out for a second.  Nancy Grace.  Thank you.  Oh, Nancy Grace.  Nancy Grace.  The Wolverine.  They fucking, all of them, are like, she was real. 
[00:07:30]  She was authentic.  Oh, my God.  No.  It's like, no.  She was a terrible, terrible witness.  She could be the worst witness I've ever seen.  I've watched many cases, these high-profile cases.  She could possibly be the worst witness I've ever seen in my life.  I know.  I'm laughing.  I put a picture up of her, too.  I'm laughing because of what Jimmy tweeted last night.  Because we got a picture on one of our screens right now.  That is, I can't, it's your thing. 
[00:08:00]  I can't do it.  She, she, it's fucking Patrice.  It's, it's Patrice.  It's, it's not just like, wow, Patrice is a big black guy.  She's a fat black girl.  Right.  She looks like Patrice O'Neal.  She has, like, a face, the face.  It's the lip.  It's the, it's the face.  It's the eyes.  Everything, yeah.  The ornery expression.  And she was making the face.  She was curling her nose up and looking like, hmm.  Like Patrice used to do.  That's Patrice as a tranny, man.  If he was here, I just, I've never wanted him to be alive. 
[00:08:30]  Just so I could sit next to him and look at her picture and just point at him and point  at her.  Yeah, yeah.  We'd be like, ah, ah, look at you, too.  He would enjoy that.  He would enjoy.  He would have loved this.  He would enjoy how much she looked like him.  And he would get it.  He'd pop the picture up and be like, ah.  Oh, no.  No.  He was, oh, no.  Because he would see the, he would see the case going up in smoke.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  At least it was made clear that, ah, that wasn't Trayvon Martin's girlfriend. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  God, it's bad enough that you're, you're not walking around this earth anymore.  But I, I don't think you want the world to, to think that you're dating that.  There was so much going on.  So many subtleties and so many in-your-face things going on with this witness yesterday.  Uh, she was absolutely, uh, uh, incoherent.  You couldn't understand.  The lawyers had to ask her, excuse me, excuse me.  And each time she repeated herself, she got more and more angry and belligerent. 
[00:09:30]  She, but she wasn't understandable as a witness.  Uh, listening to the defense attorneys read back her statements from the deposition in authentic jive.  Right.  It was unbelievable.  Hey, we got a lot of interns around here.  Sam Roberts.  Can we get someone to, uh, hit up the Twitter feed?  Uh, Rachel, John, John tell Sam put that in the search, not, not from our listeners.  Get the older ones from yesterday, please. 
[00:10:00]  I need just a, I just need a smattering of, of tweets about her.  Cause they were all over the place.  They really were.  Some of them.  I couldn't believe that people were watching the same thing I was watching.  Get the good ones, the bad ones, the sideways ones.  Just a little, a little sample, if you will.  Please.  Why is she page 19 in the paper?  I'll tell you why.  The, she was embarrassing as a witness.  The, the media's whole take on this is they need the prosecution to look like they are, are fucking knocking it out of the park. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  That, that Trayvon Martin was killed, um, unarmed teen, killed by big bad George Zimmerman, um, unprovoked.  He was chased down.  That her testimony was a flop for the prosecution.  And, uh, you know, if she was a, uh, uh, an articulate woman who got on the stand and tore this case up like the star witness was supposed to, she'd be on the front page right now. 
[00:11:00]  She'd be on the front fucking page right now.  But she came off as, uh, uh, I'm sorry.  I, I thought she was retarded.  I absolutely thought there was something wrong with her mentally.  And she had some form of, of retardation.  Well, see, people are defending her already on, on our phones.  She's from Haiti.  Who cares?  She hasn't been in the country too long.  What?  She did get me with one thing, though.  Like, when she lied about why she went to the hot, didn't go to the wake and said she was in the hospital because she felt guilty and she couldn't look at the body. 
[00:11:30]  That made me sad.  I believed her.  Perhaps.  That was really miserable testimony.  Perhaps.  That's the only part, that's the only part I liked her and was there.  I felt bad for her at that moment.  And I'm like, you know, you just feel like the, the, but the caring, uh, part of it is, is discounted by everything else she's done.  And it's, and, and this, this attitude of, I want to get out of the court.  When you see Trayvon's father face plant into his own hand, shaking his head at her testimony, he's looking and, and, and the mother is just wide-eyed staring at her. 
[00:12:00]  During her testimony, the father is shaking his head.  He put his hand over his, his brow and he's shaking his head.  Like, I can't believe this is the woman that the prosecution has said is going to bring, you know, justice to my child.  Right.  They couldn't believe it.  And she doesn't even care about the justice.  She's, she was bothered that she was even there.  She didn't want to, she didn't want to show up.  She was saying, how much longer is this going to take? 
[00:12:30]  I ain't coming back tomorrow.  And when the defense attorney said, you know, uh, your honor, we're going to need another, you know, we should recess until tomorrow.  Uh, we're, we're going to need another two hours on this.  You heard her to go, ah, ah, no, she went.  What?  What?  Like two hours.  What?  And the judge had to even say, hey, hey, we don't discuss this shit.  When is she back on the stand?  Nine o'clock.  All right.  This show ends today at nine o'clock.  No shit.  Um, well.  I, I, I, I watched it. 
[00:13:00]  We got some clips.  Let's just go through some clips.  Oh, yeah, please.  We, uh, we got some highlights of, uh, Rachel Jantel's, uh, testimony there.  She's nowhere to be found in the fucking papers.  It's, it's, it's astounding.  The star witness for the prosecution, the one who's talking to him, is nowhere to be found.  The biggest cases.  I mean, and then when you see, uh, when, when, when George Zimmerman, there were allegations  that he was chasing, uh, down Trayvon, allegations that he used the word coon that was totally  dispelled, uh, uh, after they went through the tapes. 
[00:13:30]  But all that was on the front fucking page.  Page 22.  Front page.  Page 19 and page 22.  For the star witness.  Anyone that doesn't think that the media is, is fucking in on it somehow.  Exactly.  You're blind.  Because they can't have a real conversation about what they just saw.  Unbelievable.  You can't talk like we're talking about this broad.  No.  No.  Yeah, you do.  You saw what happens on Twitter.  I must have been called a racist fucking 50 times at least last night.  Getting into nothing but factual discussions. 
[00:14:00]  The Post is still calling her a girlfriend.  This is the media.  They, they made it clear it wasn't Trayvon's girlfriend.  Get off.  Get off.  And this is her picture with 12-year-old Trayvon's picture in the circle.  12-year-old Trayvon.  Last words of Trayvon Martin said in a call to girlfriend Rachel Jantel before his phone  cut out.  And that wasn't the last words.  Wow.  There was all kinds of speculation as to who she heard.  The deposition, in the deposition she said, uh, it might be Trayvon.  And then they asked her, they reiterated, you know, who was that on the phone? 
[00:14:30]  Wait, uh, it might have been.  Right.  It might have been Trayvon.  And then she gets on the stand and goes, it was Trayvon.  And then the defense attorney goes, let's look back at your deposition where you said  it might have been.  See, they can't even get the, the, the basic facts right.  Yeah.  They say girlfriend.  But the papers are horrendous.  They're despicable, man.  They get shit wrong every fucking day.  They will stick to the initial thing there.  There's no further investigation to it.  Uh, uh, George Zimmerman was not on a neighborhood watch that night. 
[00:15:00]  He was a neighborhood watch guy, but he was, he was taking his car to Target.  He was getting in his car and leaving to go to Target.  Well, let's get, let's get the audio on.  Yeah.  Because it's terrific.  Wow.  There's some real comedy here.  Oh my God.  After he said that, what, did you say anything back to him or did he say anything back to  you?  Yes.  I asked him how my man looked like.  He just told me that man, the man looked creepy. 
[00:15:30]  And he said the man looked creepy.  Creepy white.  Okay.  Excuse my English cracker.  Okay.  And what did you say?  Creepy white what?  He said, excuse my English cracker.  It's a creepy white, excuse my English cracker.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  She dropped the N bomb too, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, uh, some N bombs, but, uh, they, they dumped out of that on CNN.  Did they really?  Oh yeah.  They dumped it on CNN.  They were beeping her saying cracker.  Yeah.  All of a sudden. 
[00:16:00]  They bleeped her saying cracker.  All of a sudden they would just cut the audio.  And I was like, oh, they're having a problem with the feed.  I didn't even know at first.  I didn't even know at first.  That's why I go with just-  You're the fucking news, you stupid fucks.  Oh my God.  And you're allowed to have, uh, any word you want on your, on, on your, uh, network.  There's a pure internet feed you gotta go with.  No news carrying it.  I had no idea.  I just thought they were having technical difficulties at first.  Wow.  Until I found out later on.  Yeah.  It's, it's amazing.  They bleeped it out. 
[00:16:30]  And then they were bleeping the fact that Trayvon, you know, uh, they, they try to pin a lot  of racism on, on George Zimmerman, the fact that he's like, oh, he's a black man.  Remember when the news, NBC edited his recording to make it sound like he just blurted out he's  a black man trying to be, uh, make him as a racist.  Uh, well, Trayvon sees this guy who he assumes is white and he's like, oh, this crazy ass cracker.  Fucking racist.  And the only one that said racist stuff was Trayvon.  It was Trayvon. 
[00:17:00]  It's the only one on the phone that was saying racist stuff.  Oh, he said coon.  No, he said it was cold and they proved that.  And then Trayvon is like, oh, raise that crack.  Oh, this nigga's still following me.  Like it's, it's all, all this shit.  All right.  Back to Rachel.  Okay.  And what did you say?  Okay.  They're having trouble hearing you.  So take your time.  Creepy ass.  Curb.  Which is nothing I am.  Please pack cracker.  Okay.  And I know you grew up in a Haitian family. 
[00:17:30]  So make sure that everybody can hear you try to speak as clear.  Okay.  Can you, can you read?  They're blaming her horrible English on the fact that she grew up in a, in a Haitian family.  And then this is another great thing.  I saw a lot of black people tweeting last night saying that the defense was, was saying  they couldn't hear her on purpose, even though they could completely understand her to make  her look bad. 
[00:18:00]  Well, cause people are assholes, but I can't, you couldn't understand her.  No, well, people are assholes too, because you could hear the feet on TV, but in the  courtroom, it's a whole different world.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stenographer couldn't hear her.  Right.  That was the stenographer.  The stenographer is pretty much sitting right next to her, but she's mic'd obviously for the,  for the broadcast.  Yeah.  So people like at home are so stupid, they're thinking, Oh, I can hear every word she's  saying, but, but she's pretty much whispering in the courtroom.  Yeah.  Repeat what your answer was, please. 
[00:18:30]  Creepy ass.  What's the question?  The question was, you want to repeat your answer when you said what you asked him.  I had asked him how the man looked like.  He looked like a creepy ass.  Correct?  Okay.  Now you make sure we got that creepy ass.  I had asked the man looked like.  I had asked the man looked like.  You mean like a white individual?  Yes.  Isn't it crazy?  What did you say to him?  Or what did he say to you after that? 
[00:19:00]  So, he kept, he told me the man was looking at him.  So I had to think it might have been a rapist.  And you know, Larry, it might have been a rapist.  But they're, they're dumping out.  They're the news.  And I don't know a white guy.  I don't know one white guy that gets mad at the word cracker.  Cracker.  So, so who's, who's getting bothered by that language?  Any word, by the way, that's said in this context of a news broadcast of a live trial 
[00:19:30]  that's going on.  You shouldn't bleep anything.  Of course.  I don't care if it's cracker, nigger, anything.  Should not be fucking bleeped in, in this context.  How can you say that any word can't be used in the context of a trial?  A murder trial.  A murder trial.  Right.  A live broadcast of a murder trial.  Where you want to see all the information.  I get it.  Huh.  I get it.  Oh.  Because it was Trayvon saying it.  Oh, right. 
[00:20:00]  It doesn't look good for the narrative.  Right.  But it's funny.  They played Kuhn a lot when they thought Zimmerman said it.  Right.  Remember that?  On the news, they were like, over and over.  Let's play it again.  Let's play it again.  Let's play it again.  Oh, what are you hearing there?  Is that Kuhn?  Oh, that's Kuhn.  I hear it.  Oh, it could be something else.  They analyzed it.  Now, the second it's like, well, what did Trayvon say?  Oh, he said, you know, crazy ass crack.  Crazy.  Cut it out.  Cut it out.  It's exhausting. 
[00:20:30]  Interesting, though, how they left it in when it was supposedly Zimmerman.  Uh-huh.  All right.  She explains why she didn't go to the funeral.  The star witness.  The funeral?  Why didn't go to the viewer?  The awakening.  I didn't want to see the body.  I did agree with my friend to go.  You got to understand.  You got to understand.  You're the last person to talk to the person and he dialed on the phone. 
[00:21:00]  After you talk to him, you got to understand what I'm trying to tell you.  I'm the last person.  You don't know how I felt.  You think I really want to go see the body after I just talked to him?  I understand what you're saying, but what you did instead was instead of saying... 
[00:21:30]  I did not even know he was out.  I did not even watch the news.  I don't watch the news.  I heard there was on a meeting.  There was on local news.  I did not know about that.  Okay.  I knew that it was emotionally difficult for you to decide whether or not to go to the  memorial service.  Yes.  And you decided not to?  So, I suppose.  Sure.  And then what you did in order to explain that to Ms. Fulton and then to Mr. De La Rionda 
[00:22:00]  under oath was that you created a lie and said that you'd gone to the hospital.  Yes.  Yep.  A lot of fucking fib.  A lot of fibbing on her part, but...  You got to understand.  She starts getting annoyed.  This is where it got good.  Oh, she starts getting a little annoyed at the...  She's pretty much had it.  This is taking a little too long. 
[00:22:30]  And she has her court nails on and everything.  And she won't get out on the town.  She wants out of there now.  There was a tweet that she made saying,  Oh, I got my court nails on.  She's very happy with her manicure.  And she got her court nails on.  They deleted that from her string of tweets that they had deleted the day before she testified.  Because there were a lot of tweets of inappropriate things.  Her drinking, smoking weed, things like that. 
[00:23:00]  So, yeah.  So, what you are saying is that, indeed, what you told Mr. Crump in this recorded interview,  that what George Zimmerman said in response to him saying,  what you following me, or why you following me,  George Zimmerman said, what are you talking about?  Oh, that's what you're talking about?  No.  I think we'll have to adjust the recording itself. 
[00:23:30]  I had told you...  Are you listening?  Yes, ma'am.  I had told you what happened to me in Crump's interview.  I had Rush on me.  Are you listening?  One more time.  I'm sorry I was distracted.  Oh.  You told me what?  He's doing it on purpose.  Right there, he's absolutely fucking it.  He's doing it on purpose.  Absolutely annoying her.  He knows he's got her, and he knows that if he continues, she's going to fucking lose it a little bit.  You want that moment that the movies have, the lawyer TV shows, 
[00:24:00]  where the lawyer gets the fucking person on the stand so upset that they explode,  they do something that the jury looks at and goes, oh boy.  I'm telling you, today might be different, though, because today, last night, they probably prepped her  and said, look, he's doing this on purpose.  He's trying to get you upset.  She's unpreppable, though.  Yeah, I certainly disagree with you, Jimmy.  They're certainly sitting her down and discussing everything.  But she's going to blow it today. 
[00:24:30]  Maybe for the first few minutes.  Right, but she doesn't have it in her to keep calm.  You're right.  She doesn't have it in her to fucking prep.  There'll be more of this today.  It'll take a while.  The second she gets pissed, she's going to start doing that sassy thing.  If she's up there for two hours, she'll have an attitude.  Making soup in those pants.  Sitting there.  I'm just hoping they make her try to read.  Oh, my God, please.  And she was doing that. 
[00:25:00]  And you know they're trying to figure out how to do that without making it obvious that  they were kind of...  Oh, they just kind of throw the deposition at her and say, well, I want you to review  this.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  Well, she was reviewing it, but it was so obvious she doesn't know how to read.  No.  And then they'd ask her questions about what she supposedly just reviewed, and she had  no clue.  Right.  It's like, well, you just read your deposition.  Right.  She's not...  She can't read.  This is a great witness to watch.  One more time.  I'm sorry.  I was distracted.  You told me what? 
[00:25:30]  I had told you during the interview between me and Crump, I had rushed on it.  And before that interview, I had told my mom if they have any...  If the officer wanted to talk to me, they could talk to me to know exactly what happened.  And I had told you that on the depot.  And I had told...  And they said it right there.  I rushed on it.  I had told you I rushed on it.  When you say you rushed on it, you mean you hadn't thought to get through it carefully  to be sure that you...  I just told it...  That you told Trayvon Park. 
[00:26:00]  They just told Trayvon Park.  Are you saying that you rushed through it and you didn't think about it carefully enough  to be sure that you told it accurately?  Yes.  Oh, man.  Yes.  She's getting...  She's starting to tap on the fucking...  The fucking wood in front of her.  Oh, boy.  How do you stop?  I'm becoming consumed with rage for the press.  Oh.  Like, it's all I can think of when I think of our country.  We've known this for years.  I know, but I can't...  For years.  It's almost like, but I can't even think anymore. 
[00:26:30]  It's so infuriating.  They're so fucking hateable.  Yeah.  I started down this road when we got fired and how they just reported everything completely  wrong with us.  And then that opened my stupid eyes.  I was like, whoa, if they're getting our dumb stuff wrong, what else are they getting wrong  out there?  Everything, apparently.  And I've been pretty much obsessed with it since.  Yeah.  God, that's fucking terrible.  I guess because you're a kid.  They can't even get the basic shit right in the paper or on the news.  You believe growing up that they're right.  And I guess that's what it is. 
[00:27:00]  It's like how...  Well, you believe they're unbiased, too.  Or at least trying to be honest.  Right.  Like, you don't think that they're fucking liars.  Like, they're liars.  Oh, yeah.  They're complete liars.  They're fucking liars.  They have a story.  They have a narrative.  They have a case that they want to go the way they want it to go, which makes the better  story, and they will lie and just completely fabricate shit, twist things around in order  for it to be what they want it to be.  They want a white guy to have shot an unarmed black child over nothing but his overzealousness 
[00:27:30]  and racism.  That's what they want.  Anything that deviates from that, they will twist around and try to fit it into that narrative.  And the more that comes out that proves that isn't the case, they just eliminate it.  They bury it.  They bury it on fucking pages of the newspaper.  They bury it in their broadcasts.  Or they lie in the post.  Or they lie about it.  They lie.  That's how...  That's the fucking world we're in as far as what the news is telling you people. 
[00:28:00]  So, you know, do your own fucking research or be an ignorant, uninformed puppet of these  news agencies.  More importantly, she got annoyed because she has to come back today.  Oh, she certainly did.  I was kind of bummed out they stopped it.  I think it was a mistake, actually.  I think you should have kept going.  I was all in.  Kept going.  She'll be prepared today.  Not as good as she needs to be, but way better than she...  He had her off guard last night.  He should have kept going.  I think this defense attorney is good, but I also think he's kind of a fucking dummy. 
[00:28:30]  And that knock-knock joke is an insight into his instincts, which are not amazing.  Not good instincts.  No.  No.  Not amazing.  No.  Can we break for the day, Judge?  Any objections?  I'd like to continue, but I prefer to the court, but...  How much more time do you think that you need to finish your cross?  Well, I certainly wouldn't.  I don't know for sure.  I would think we should plan on at least a couple of hours.  What?  Excuse me. 
[00:29:00]  Excuse me.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to break for the evening.  Everybody still remain seated.  Including you, Mr. Intel, please remain seated.  She was ready to get up.  Yeah.  The one clip we missed was when she said...  For you?  Oh, you got it?  Oh, yes.  Is it the one where they said, are you refusing to come back?  That one?  Oh, okay.  Good.  Yeah.  Hit that.  You don't take as much time as you want.  Read the whole thing if you want.  Or maybe we can break until the morning.  No. 
[00:29:30]  I'm leaving today.  What's that?  What's up?  I'm leaving today.  Nope.  I'm leaving today.  Are you refusing to come back tomorrow?  To you?  Are you refusing to come?  We need to keep this question and answer about our testimony.  Any other matters dealing with scheduling, I will make that decision.  She was right.  The judge was right.  Oh, yeah.  Are you refusing to come back tomorrow?  The judge is like, nah, nah. 
[00:30:00]  Not in my court, motherfuckers.  But it's really bad that she's bothered that she's in court.  She's terrible, dude.  You got to...  Oh, my God.  She's going to be eaten alive today.  And here's what it is.  I can't wait for this shit today.  You can think of her intent, the reason why she's upset being there, why she doesn't want  to be there, all that.  You can speculate, speculate, speculate, all you want about that.  The only thing that matters in this case is what the jury sees and thinks and how it  will affect their decision.  When they see the prosecution's star witness and this attitude that she doesn't even want 
[00:30:30]  to be there, her testimony is so just laxadaisical about what happened and, you know, yeah, I'll  tell you, but you know what?  I'd rather not even be here.  Oh, these lawyers, this, the court, the judge, that...  It doesn't make the jury go, wow, what she said, yeah, I really got to consider that.  It's insane.  Well, there you go.  There you go. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  It was a busy news day yesterday, my God.  Oh, my goodness.  I just can't wait till, uh, I'm going to watch a little more of her later on.  Watch the news feed, though.  Dude, I didn't know they dumped out of it until you just played.  That ruined my day.  Oh, it's good.  That ruined my fucking day.  I didn't know until after the fact.  I really thought they might be having technical problems while she was up there.  But that's why they did it.  There are a lot of live feeds of this case when you just put in Zimmerman Trial Live, and there's  a bunch of links.  Some of them are news sites, though.  Like, there's the NBC affiliate in Florida. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  And they have the feed from the courtroom, and they talk over it.  They put graphics.  They do things like that.  And then there's just the raw fucking video feed.  That's the one to watch if you don't want to, you know, see those cuts.  This is what I would say.  It's too late for, you know, network TV.  It's too late.  They're long gone.  They're fucking crazy people.  They're fucking ridiculous.  The internet has a great opportunity here, but you see that time and time again. 
[00:32:00]  They're going the way of the networks, and they're starting to bleep out their feeds or  pixelating a fucking nipple or what have you.  No need.  You're the place to go right now.  Yeah.  Because people are fed up.  So don't make the same mistakes they made.  Yep.  It's kind of like sort of what's going on here a little bit.  Yeah.  You know, satellite radio is way ahead of regular radio.  You've got to search it out.  Find the good stuff.  But don't make the same mistakes. 
[00:32:30]  People do want a raw feed of this.  They always will.  Well, but, you know.  It's amazing.  You see the sites going the same way.  They're like, oh, boy.  Yeah, our website, we can't have that either.  We can't.  We have advertisers now, and they might be offended.  Somebody might be offended.  Apple TV works great, too.  You have an Apple TV with the computer.  You get the feed up, and then you just pop it up.  I was watching it on my big screen.  Hey, good morning, Jackie.  Thank you, Jackie.  Wow, those are perfectly placed.  Oh, look. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, that's not.  Oh, you picked the right font and everything.  Thank you.  Well, good font choices is right.  Look at your little hat today.  You look so pretty.  I always like an intern in a hat.  I think that makes the day go better for everyone.  Could you throw that hat up in the air and say,  We're going to make it after all.  Now you guys are singing together when they come in.  She's got the Mary Tyler Moore hat, and she's a small-town girl in the big city trying  to make it.  She dropped it right there. 
[00:33:30]  I could just look down and read it.  Living in New York City.  No convenience.  Perfect.  That's right.  With her Mary Tyler Moore hat.  Perfect.  This kid's good.  Tweets for Rachel Jantel.  Rachel Jantel didn't lie to cover up evidence.  She lied because she couldn't deal with pain.  That's nothing to be shameful about.  And let me tell you, the downracial lines, the difference between opinions and what people  think about this case down racial lines is astounding. 
[00:34:00]  Every person that has bitched at me about even just spelling out facts on this case, 90%  of them are black people that are mad at me.  Well, here's a black lady.  Her tweet, pray for Rachel Jantel.  She needs strength and wisdom.  We can't offer her.  Strength and wisdom.  We can't offer her.  Uplift her.  Don't tear her apart.  Then not Charles Barkley, which is a great Twitter account to follow.  Lawyer.  We need her for a few more hours tomorrow. 
[00:34:30]  Rachel Jantel.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  Time for that.  Oh, Lord.  It's a fire.  Big Daddy.  Looks like a black guy.  He writes, she just snapped on the attorney.  I'm through.  Rachel Jantel is the realest person on earth right now.  Realest.  This isn't a fucking movie, people.  This isn't some movie where the sassy black girl gets in there and gives a what of it  to the fucking lawyers.  This is a guy's life hanging in the balance on a murder charge. 
[00:35:00]  She's the star prosecution witness.  This isn't just the girl that played Precious.  No matter how much you want to think it is, that ain't her.  This isn't an uplifting movie where at the end everything works out.  I'm surprised no one made the connection that Precious.  Jesus Christ.  That's right.  You know, no one tweeted that she looked like Precious.  Oh, they did, Ann.  Wow, did they?  I must have missed all of those. 
[00:35:30]  If you're not the first one in with that, just stop.  If you're tweeting that two hours after she's been on TV.  Yeah, if she's on the stand for five minutes, just don't bother.  If you're one of the first ones in, fine.  There was a good one last night.  Somebody said she looked like Biz Markie.  See?  That made me laugh.  There you go with the twist.  Black Girl writes on Twitter yesterday,  Twitter thugs harassing Rachel Jantel.  To me or...  Oh.  Twitter thugs harassing Rachel Jantel. 
[00:36:00]  To me are no better than George Zimmerman.  She didn't cause this or choose this.  Oh, boy.  You harass her because it was completely out of the ordinary.  She's a terrible witness.  It was out of the...  Or was it out of the ordinary?  I don't even fucking know.  All I know is she came off as very ignorant, uneducated.  She came off as uneducated.  How the fuck is she going into the 12th grade?  How did she...  Even though she's 18 going into the 12th grade next year,  how did she get through all of those years of school, 
[00:36:30]  passed along,  when she does not even have a command of the English language?  Well, we got Rachel...  She's calling our show right now.  And I just checked the area code.  This is legit.  Oh, wow.  Rachel Jantel from Florida.  What's up?  You can't handle the motherfucking truth.  Oh, is that a...  You seem nicer today.  A few good men right there.  That's right on.  A few good men.  Here's another one. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Rachel Jantel is brave and real.  Shame on anyone who makes fun or criticize her.  Support her.  Love her.  No!  Why?  She came across as a dummy that was frustrated that she had to be there  for her, quote, friend.  Yes.  What are you talking about?  That's the only way to see this one.  Oh, she's 19?  Yeah, she's 19 going into the 12th grade.  That's wonderful.  Look, man.  We all know someone that got left back.  Yeah.  I hear you.  Looking at Rachel Jantel's mentions, people are so cruel. 
[00:37:30]  I'm personally proud of you, Rachel.  Very genuine and honest.  Prayers for you.  That's what the news was saying.  Headline news, fucking all those, MSNBC.  She's so real.  She's authentic.  What does that mean?  They literally are these fucking cowards.  Yes.  Won't criticize a black person.  It's so bizarre.  If that was a white girl, let's just say it's a white girl, 19-year-old white girl,  she gets up on the stand and sounded that ignorant, they would speculate that she had 
[00:38:00]  mental problems, and they would absolutely talk about, like, oh, that didn't go well  because, you know, she didn't have a command of the English language, she didn't understand  the questioning, but she's black, so they're like, she's keeping it real.  Well, we definitely got a couple black people that are keeping it real with their tweets.  This black woman, she writes, Rachel Jantel is a disgrace to us. 
[00:38:30]  I'm appalled at her controversial testimony.  I'm praying the truth prevails.  And then a black guy, before I hung up the phone, I would have told Rachel Jantel not  to testify.  No shit.  Uh, star witness.  Another black person here, George Zimmerman's lawyer tried to destroy the credibility of  the prosecution's star witness, Rachel Jantel.  Jenny Hudson, idiot. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, is she a dummy?  What did she say?  She was on headline news.  She's becoming a star with Dr. Drew.  Dr. Drew, and she's rambling on.  Babbling?  What a fucking henna-headed dope she is.  What did she say?  You found it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All right, great.  Jenny Hut.  Yeah, Jenny Hut.  Thank you.  So, listen, I loved this witness.  I loved her for the prosecution.  And here's why.  I believed her. 
[00:39:30]  I watched her today as though I were a juror at home.  And I felt like she was without guile.  She was just there to do the right thing today.  If guile is education, then you're right.  I felt like she was there telling the truth.  I felt her emotion.  And I felt like she was a kid when this went down.  She's still a kid.  And, frankly, there are funerals that I haven't shown up to because it was too much for me to  to take as a 43-year-old grown woman.  She's only 43?  Oh, my God.  And look at her, so composed being there. 
[00:40:00]  To be a witness in this trial, I think she perhaps is a little naive and a little innocent  in life.  What?  And I just, I believe her.  And I think the jury will, too.  Well, we're going to break her.  No, they won't.  These are real people.  She's not a professional.  We're going to see some expert witnesses.  They get paid to testify.  Can I ask you a question?  This is a teenager.  And I think the women on this.  There is truth to that.  Like, sometimes her being uncomfortable or talking low, that didn't bother me.  That's fine.  Because, again, she's not used to doing this.  She's in a murder trial on television.  She wants to go home.  She knows she's a big fatso. 
[00:40:30]  But it was some of the shitty, the lying.  It was the attitude, man.  And the lying.  Right.  Yeah, let's stick to the facts.  You can't lie in a deposition in a fucking murder trial, especially if you're 18 or 17.  You can't.  She's not nine.  And another thing is, yes, the prosecution's job is to prepare that person for the stand like that.  Prepare that person, whether they're a teen or not.  There are very fucking amazingly brave children, six and seven-year-olds, that have testified in court and done an amazing job at that. 
[00:41:00]  She's not prepareable.  I want to read a couple more of these tweets.  People are really mean for bashing Rachel Jantel, and the majority of the people doing it are black.  And that's a black lady.  I did see a lot of black people beating the crap out of her, too.  Yes.  Just now watching Rachel Jantel's testimony, she's still being questioned by the prosecution.  I feel she's very credible at this point. 
[00:41:30]  She's incredible.  Unbelievable.  How do people, what are they watching?  You can't look at her and be like, well, that's what the prosecution needs the jury to see.  That witness.  Mr. Perry on Twitter, black guy, says, one last thought.  I blame that whole being Rachel ghetto ignorant movement, not Rachel Jantel, if Zimmerman walks free.  There's some punctuation in there.  Yeah, I'm trying to figure it out.  All right. 
[00:42:00]  Rachel Jantel's appearance is a step too far, but lying under oath, her inarticulate, hostile showing compromises the Zimmerman trial.  That's a black guy, too.  Yeah, it does.  Y'all going to let Rachel Jantel make it?  The girl is in high school.  She keeps it real.  She's tired.  Keeps it real.  Is keeping it real in the black community sounding like an ignorant motherfucker, having no command of the English language, being belligerent to any authority figure? 
[00:42:30]  Is that keeping it real, you fucking idiots?  We got a black woman.  She tweeted, it bothers me that those on CNN are bothered by Rachel Jantel saying cracker, but Paula Deen admits to using the N-word frequently.  30 years ago.  But that bothered people.  What do you mean?  Why is she saying they were outraged that Paula Deen said nigger?  They fired her.  Of course.  She lost every sponsor because she admitted to saying a 30-year-old.  What are you talking about?  She's losing sponsors as we speak. 
[00:43:00]  They're throwing her out of everything.  Mm-hmm.  Rachel Jantel, a.k.a.  Precious, made me so freaking hot today.  She proves why education is necessary for our youth.  She was ridiculous.  Black woman.  There you go.  Another black woman.  Maybe Rachel Jantel was having difficulty reading on the stand.  She's returning to 12th grade at the age of 19.  What would you expect?  See, I mean, yeah.  So, you know.  Keith Robinson hated her.  I saw Keith.  Oh, did he?  Really?  I saw Keith.  He was the first one I heard called Precious. 
[00:43:30]  That made me laugh.  God damn it.  I saw him at the show last night.  He's like, oh, that bitch bugs me.  He was really a man.  Bugs me.  Yeah.  A lot of people don't like her.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  For that reason.  A black woman.  I'm just about done here.  Unacceptable to attack Rachel Jantel.  She's a young girl in an awful situation without the skills to cope and manage it gracefully.  There's this inability by the white media, especially mainstream media, white people, to criticize a black person. 
[00:44:00]  And then when they're a girl and a teen, there's this thing like you can only make excuses for them.  And then you get someone like Jenny Hutt, who is so blinded by white guilt, I would assume, that she can't even see that this witness was completely awful for the prosecution.  Get her on the phone.  Yeah, let's talk to her.  Get her on the phone.  Yes, please.  She looks good on TV, though.  I'll say that.  Jenny looks really good on TV.  Think she looks good on TV? 
[00:44:30]  She does.  She looks great, actually, on Dr. Drew's show.  She looked really hot.  She's becoming a thing for Dr. Drew.  Good for her.  Yeah, I'm happy for her.  Now that she doesn't have to deal with the stewards.  Yeah.  Those.  Let's see.  Defense attorney wants in here.  Let's say hi to Joe in Connecticut.  Joe, how are you?  Hi, Joe.  Good morning, guys.  I just wanted to give you some insight from a practicing attorney here dealing with.  Well, get it right, Joe. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, all right.  Sorry, all right.  Let me see what's going to happen today.  So you guys watch this.  All right.  They're going to prep.  They're going to prep her to be very emotional.  And very soft-spoken and slow.  That's going to be the key to the entire thing.  So she's going to come out very slow, as elegant as she can speak.  But she's going to also be very emotional and sad and maybe even tearful.  Uh-huh.  The key for the defense attorney is going to be to turn sadness into anger, which is a very fine line.  Uh-huh.  And that's going to change everything. 
[00:45:30]  Now, watch when it happens.  And she's going to snap.  And that Komodo dragon neck is going to absolutely go.  I think this guy's absolutely right.  I think they're going to look at what was effective yesterday and what people thought was effective.  And her emotion at that one part where she's talking about the funeral.  That was effective.  They're going to want to capitalize on that, get more of those moments.  But she is incapable of holding that for any length of time.  And I just want to tag what he's saying.  We were all waiting for that moment yesterday. 
[00:46:00]  It was almost there.  Almost.  The what?  What?  Today, you get the moment.  Today, you get it.  You're going to get something amazing today.  It might take a while, but you watch.  Is the guy still on the phone?  Yes.  Hey, I think that to the defense attorney.  Oh, no.  He just hung up, unfortunately.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  I think she's going to do a better job than people think today because they had her last  night.  And I think that when I say had her, I understand why she's upset, of course. 
[00:46:30]  You know, she didn't ask me to put in this place.  Uh-huh.  But I mean, I think that she'll be much better prepared today.  And I'm telling you, I think the defense attorney's instincts were right, but I think that he's  a dope on some level.  Uh-huh.  And I think that she will be a much better witness for them today.  Well, here's something that you might have missed also.  When he said, we'd like to recess until tomorrow, the prosecution wanted to continue. 
[00:47:00]  Yes.  Now, why would the prosecution want her to keep continuing when she was right on the  verge of fucking blowing up?  Because I think the prosecution was hoping to finish the testimony today and get it over  with.  Yeah.  I don't think the prosecution even saw a couple more hours.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He wanted to get it done with.  Right.  I disagree.  I don't think you could prepare her properly and it's going to get ugly today.  I think in the beginning, you're going to see exactly what that guy that just called  up.  But you're going to see it unravel.  Right.  And I'm telling you, we're going to have that moment today that we all sort of were hoping 
[00:47:30]  for yesterday.  Sassy black woman.  Something that will be, yeah, one for the ages.  That fucking something.  Wheelbarrow tire tube around her neck.  She's going to go.  Is it Woody Mandela going to hold her?  Oh, wow.  Very good.  All right.  We should break.  Yeah, we got our grub here.  We got to talk about Hernandez.  That is a fucked up story up there in Boston.  Aaron Hernandez.  What a fucking psycho.  Yeah, we got the timeline.  They are.  Well, he's finished, man.  We'll get.  Oh, obviously. 
[00:48:00]  We'll we'll get into it next.  But basically, they have they feel very confident with what they have gathered so far.  Feeling pretty confident, are you?  And they're pretty much saying that he he pulled the trigger, too.  Yeah.  So we got the timeline of the events that went down with Aaron Hernandez.  He is a gangster.  He's a thug.  He just signed an extension.  Forty million dollars for five years.  Twenty three years old.  You think they'll pay it off?  You think they'll pay off his deal? 
[00:48:30]  Twenty three years old.  He was going to make eight million a year for the next five.  What are you doing?  How do you not give that any thought?  Dude, by the time he was twenty eight, he would have made forty million dollars.  Another forty million.  He was already making a shitload of money.  And this isn't one of these spur of the moment, like, like someone said something, did something.  He walked in, seen his wife being.  Yeah, right, right.  Premeditated.  This is he had to think this out and think, hmm, I have this life.  Forty million dollar contract.  Fucking NFL.  Let me weigh it against like a premeditated murder. 
[00:49:00]  He he had enough time, probably a few hours, I guess.  Yeah.  Wow.  To hash that out.  To figure it out.  And now and now they're all already hinting about concussions and all that shit.  Yeah.  Is his mind right?  Does it have something to do with, you know, playing in the NFL?  Floyd rage or whatever.  They're hinting at that a little bit.  Well, maybe maybe he had it in him the whole time.  I don't know.  A lot of these football players are very aggressive people. 
[00:49:30]  Very aggressive.  Wow.  What a dope.  Wow.  I was right.  I was thinking the same thing yesterday.  We were talking at the cellar last time.  I'm like, he had 40 million coming in.  Like you said, a spur of the moment fight.  But to actually plan out and shoot a guy because he was talking to people you don't like?  Stop being friends with him.  Go make your 40 million.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I mean, we're kind of doing it, so we should continue here.  So he goes to the strip club with his friend.  Rumors.  We've been to Rumors.  Cool.  Over the years. 
[00:50:00]  Look out.  Rumors.  They're hanging out.  They're friends, supposedly.  I don't know how good.  Oh, best of.  You think they were besties?  I have no idea, but you shoot them five times.  Five times you get shot?  They call it a Boston nightclub, but I'm hearing it was Rumors, a strip club.  And then this guy, Hernandez's friend there, is talking to some people in the place, and  Hernandez is like, what the fuck?  Why is he talking to those people?  He doesn't like those people.  Hernandez doesn't like these people. 
[00:50:30]  Kind of gang thing?  What is it?  So he's feeling like, what the fuck?  Why are you talking to them?  Talk to them.  And that started the rage in Aaron Hernandez.  And then Hernandez calls two buddies from Connecticut.  He says, get up here.  His voice.  So Hernandez and the two pals pick up Lloyd at Lloyd's home in a silver Nissan Altima at  2.30 in the morning.  A car he rented.  When did he rent it?  That day?  The day of his death.  Oh, boy. 
[00:51:00]  Wait.  The day of his death.  Who had the car?  Hernandez supposedly rented this Nissan.  I don't know why.  I would assume he's got some cars.  I'll tell you what.  He had to move a body.  That way he was hoping to do that.  Then get the car washed with DNA evidence.  Maybe.  Oh, wait.  So are we talking a day later then, maybe?  Oh, maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe he already had it for some reason.  I don't know.  That I'm not sure of, to be honest with you.  I'm trying to figure out how many hours between them hanging out at the strip club and the  murder.  I'm not sure if it was the same night now. 
[00:51:30]  Was it?  Does anyone know this?  I'm not sure.  Because that would be the key to the rental.  Yeah.  Probably for forensic evidence.  He thought better to do it in this car.  If he rented the car after the fact, after the beef in the nightclub, shit, we kind of  need to know that.  I'm trying to figure it out.  I don't know.  All right.  So they pick up Lloyd at Lloyd's home in this rented car that Hernandez rented the day  that they killed him, or allegedly killed him. 
[00:52:00]  A series of surveillance video cameras captured images of Hernandez's car traveling to that  industrial park.  Yeah, but before they got video of the car actually going down the gravel road in an industrial  park, they also got surveillance of him leaving the home with a gun.  Oh, good one.  Wow.  He's sunk.  He's in trouble.  Big trouble.  Employees working overnight shifts near where Lloyd's body was found heard gunshots fired  between 3.23 a.m. and 3.27 a.m. when the patch tight end returned home around 3.30. 
[00:52:30]  I was reading in another paper this morning that it was an execution shooting, and they're  pretty much convinced that Hernandez pulled the trigger.  Wow.  Five shots.  Wait, so he has friends come up first?  He has these two guys come up, but they didn't arrest these two guys.  He had them come up before the murder?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought it was to hide the body.  He was pissed off, and he called his buddies.  He texted them.  I think it was a text, like, get up here.  Yeah.  First of all, you never should text. 
[00:53:00]  You should call, because you can't.  Oh, boy.  When the patch tight end returned home around 3.30 a.m., surveillance video showed him  walking through his house holding a pistol.  Okay, so they got him going back in the house with the pistol.  What a fucking dummy.  Lloyd, who's now dead, was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée.  The victim's mom declined to comment about the news of the player's arrest.  The home security system, including video surveillance equipment, was intentionally destroyed at Hernandez's pad. 
[00:53:30]  He also tried to destroy his phone.  Throw in the tub, you dope.  Not good trigger discipline right there in that picture.  That's when he was 19.  TMZ's got a picture of him holding a pistol at 19.  And he also hired a cleaning crew the next day to clean up his house.  I have those come over after parties.  Cleaning crew.  I need to know about the rental car.  Oh.  Yeah, and what did those guys do?  I didn't realize.  I thought they were.  I thought it was to hide a body.  I didn't realize that they were before the guy got shot. 
[00:54:00]  They didn't arrest.  They didn't arrest the guys.  They're probably talking.  Oh, maybe.  You bet they're talking.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  You fucking bet they're talking.  Okay, maybe that's what's going on there.  So what happened?  Well, how would you like it?  English, French, or Spanish?  Get me a pen and paper.  I'll draw a diagram.  Here's what happened.  No, nobody you called at 2.30 in the morning is going to prison for 30 years.  Right.  Because you're a hothead.  Yeah, the guy shot was his future brother-in-law.  It's just a disastrous fucking story.  He was dating his fiance's sister, right?  Amazing.  And this guy knows a little bit more about the rental car. 
[00:54:30]  Jeff in Delaware.  Mr. Hernandez, hello.  Yeah, it happened three days after the strip club.  So he rented it three days after the day of the death, the murder.  He got the rental car that morning, but that was three days after the strip club.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  So he definitely got the rental car because he was premeditating this whole thing.  For three days he was angry with that.  Oh.  Okay.  So he did get the... 
[00:55:00]  Oh, wow.  So he got the rental car hoping that would help hide the fact that he's going to fucking  kill his friend.  Something else must have happened.  So I'm going to say something else was going on.  One of them might have been fucking the other one.  Maybe the future brother-in-law fucked his fiancee and he found...  This is more than an argument at a strip club.  Threesome with the two sisters.  He was heard saying, I can't trust anyone.  Hernandez said that.  After the strip club incident, whatever went down there.  All they're reporting is that the guy who's now dead was talking to a couple people that 
[00:55:30]  Hernandez didn't like.  Was having a fight with or something.  Right, right, right.  I think you're right.  I think it's going to be one of these fucking...  You know, if they're that close where they're dating the sisters, two sisters, something  happened.  Something...  Girl-wise.  I bet it happened.  I bet it's all about a chick.  His fiancee.  And again, I'm purely speculating.  Yeah.  Or maybe he believes this guy fucked his fiancee or some weird shit.  Because you don't execute a guy a couple days later because you think he was talking to 
[00:56:00]  guys you're fighting with.  Yeah, because you've got two days to calm down.  To calm down.  So whatever happened was something that he just couldn't calm down from.  He found a text.  Sign a $40 million contract.  You're not worried about maybe some financial thing of, you know, a few bucks here or there.  Yeah.  This is personal.  He just threw his whole life away.  Oh.  Just like that.  Just like that.  I think I'm going to delve into my fucking...  What a goose.  Eggie-waggies. 
[00:56:30]  And to somebody who...  This guy, he's saying he rented all sorts of cars all the time.  Oh, yeah.  For his friends to use.  What a guy.  They found a matching bullet casing in the car that he rented.  And the bubblegum?  You know the bubblegum thing?  No.  His ATM car, this is what someone told me, it was found.  That he had bought some kind of a weird cotton candy bubblegum or whatever the flavor was.  And they found a piece of it spit out by the body.  Oh, boy.  Which was either the guy who was shot was chewing it or he was chewing it.  It was some weird gum.  It was like a... 
[00:57:00]  It was cotton candy.  It was cotton candy gum.  Chulies?  But it was a flavor that everybody doesn't buy.  And this dunce either gave it to the guy who he shot or he spit it out.  But it's on his credit card record.  What a fucking...  What are you looking for?  Airline Miles, you dumb cunt?  Dude, they're very confident in this.  Oh, they got him.  In what they got.  It seems like it.  Very confident.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  Now, let's see where the media buries Fetzo tomorrow.  Yeah.  And to the person who tweeted that the media did something about saying no flash photography 
[00:57:30]  before the testimony.  I don't remember hearing that.  I don't either.  Somebody tweeted me that and I don't know what you mean.  Maybe it did happen.  Interesting.  Stunt brain.  Holy shit, your coverage of Zimmerman's trial may be the best on radio and TV.  Well, because we try to keep it fucking real and honest.  We're keeping it real.  Wait a minute.  Oh, I thought this was Mr. Zimmerman from Escape from Alcatraz.  Oh, no.  The guard that Doc cut off his fingers in front of. 
[00:58:00]  Mr. Zimmerman!  Plinked those three fingers into the box.  Yep.  What the fuck is this about?  Heath in New York.  Yes.  Are you in a bar?  No, no, no.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, Heath.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Aaron Hernandez also has another case against him for shooting somebody in the face.  I noticed there's a pending case against him.  Oh, shit.  I shot Marvin in the face.  Shot someone in the face where?  You're saying Florida?  I think it was in Florida. 
[00:58:30]  Wow.  Boy, they gave him a $40 million contract extension.  But drop a racial epithet and you're finished.  Apparently, yeah.  I mean, you know, he's nuts.  Wait, they knew that he has a pace pending where he shot someone in the face and it came  a contract extension?  Kind of slowing down what Jimmy said, yeah.  In this crazy world we live in?  Oh, fuck.  But you use a dirty word and they get rid of you?  Apparently, that's the NFL.  This world is fucked up.  It's a strange fucking world.  Sam, can we look that up? 
[00:59:00]  Is that true?  We'll make sure that that's true.  I think he did shoot someone in the face.  I remember hearing that.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, good gracious.  Shoot him in the face.  All right, brother.  That's why I don't own a gun.  That's why.  Congratulations on the gay thing, by the way, Heath.  Bye-bye.  He's like, what?  All right, brother.  Thanks for the call.  All right, boys.  Put your ass on.  Does the gay thing mean we're going to have to go to a lot more weddings? 
[00:59:30]  That's a great point.  Fuck.  God, I hope not.  More weddings.  God, I hope not.  I was kind of against it because I just don't like going to weddings.  Go to weddings, yeah.  That was my whole stance on it.  Not because it shouldn't happen.  But I don't want to go to more fucking weddings.  Those gay weddings just look like a bore, though.  They don't look good.  It's very civil, very just like standing there.  You've been to one?  No, you see them on the news.  Yeah, I've never been to one.  They just stand there in front of like a fucking mayor or some shit.  I would assume if, you know, the floodgates are open and the gays are going to be, you 
[01:00:00]  know, marrying, then we're all going to be stuck going to more weddings.  Well, this actually only gives them rights to marital rights in states that already allow  marriages.  It doesn't actually open up more marriages in more states that don't have gay marriage  yet.  I think that's still a states' rights issue.  But this, if you are married in a state, you get all the perks, all the federal perks  that you would get as a married straight couple. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  I was so happy the Supreme Court did that.  Good for them.  CNN, when it all went down, I think they went to, I don't know, it might have been Don  Lemon.  I'm trying to get my reports right.  You ever been to his party?  And they went to that, where the movement started.  What's the name of the bar in New York?  Oh.  The gay bar?  Yeah.  Gay place. 
[01:01:00]  Wait, pretend.  I don't know.  No, I actually don't know.  No, what is it?  Where the whole movement started, because they were kicked out of the place.  Where the movement started.  I know.  Huh?  Stonewall.  Stonewall.  Ah, Stonewall.  Oh, Sam.  Just fell right into our trap.  Well, what do you know about that?  I knew there was a risk being the first person to come to it, but I thought we all took enough  time to get it.  Dude, it's written right in front of me.  You fell for it.  That's right.  You said stone. 
[01:01:30]  It's right in front of me.  Sam's gay.  Oh, Sam.  I knew it off the top of the dome.  Yeah, you fucking peck-a-lick-a.  Wow.  Shit, boss.  But CNN was trying to, you know, cover this story.  It was a big deal, and the reporter was outside Stonewall.  Yeah.  And he had to casually mention that they just happened to be having a kiss-off in front of  the bar.  Of course they are.  This guy's just fucking, this guy's just making out.  Not just making out, obnoxiously making out. 
[01:02:00]  And CNN had to kind of make believe, oh yeah, they're just having a little kiss-off here.  Oh yeah, it's fine over there, don't worry.  What's a kiss-off?  I don't know.  It made me laugh, though.  Because they were trying to downplay, because it's a big fucking story.  And these guys were just over the top.  They were wearing pink shirts with HIV on them.  What?  Just said HIV, and they were all just, like, deeply making out as the CNN reporter was 
[01:02:30]  trying to do his fucking report.  A kiss-off, what?  No problem.  You want to have one just to do it, Sam?  No.  Why not?  We could film it.  It'd be funny.  No, it wouldn't.  Gay people are hilarious, man.  I love watching the news when things like this happen, and they interview, like, gay  and lesbian people, and they're just, they're hilarious.  This means so much to me, and this is just some woman with big horn-rimmed glasses, her  hair parted on the side, and you're like, what the fuck is...  Not a hint of conditioner. 
[01:03:00]  No.  Oh, Jenny Hutts calling in five minutes.  Nice.  Probably more like three minutes.  Yeah, she calls.  Can we take, we gotta take a break.  Yeah, we're gonna take a break, so tell her to stand by.  Yeah, it's a little hangout.  Tell her to stand down.  Jenny Hutton next.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Continues in moments.  Continues in moments.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:03:30]  Continues.  Colin Quinn in studio.  Oh, my God.  I am Colin Quinn on the Twitter.  Carl!  Hi, guys.  Good morning, Colin Quinn.  Good morning, guys.  How are you?  So good to see Carl popping.  If I was any better, it would be illegal.  Oh, that's a good one.  All day you'll be hearing that.  You're a card.  Now, we got Jenny Hutton on the phone, but I want to get the first plug-in for Carl here. 
[01:04:00]  Unconstitutional.  Oh, yeah.  I'm telling you, this is a great one-man show.  Great.  And it's going to be at the Cherry Lane Theater from July 4th through the 23rd, right?  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Okay.  And how does that get me getting out of the park?  I'll tell you the truth.  I'm going to go ahead with you.  How do you get tickets?  Google it, you morons.  How else do you get tickets these days?  All right.  There you go.  I love the fact you have to give everybody the link.  Google Unconstitutional my name and enjoy a lovely show.  Right?  Google it.  It's great.  Thanks.  No shows on Wednesdays. 
[01:04:30]  No shows Wednesdays.  Is that the day Broadway goes dark?  No, it's a religious thing.  Oh, okay.  Every Wednesday is Sunday.  Unconstitutional.  Now, we got Jenny Hutton on the phone.  Jenny Hutton.  She's now, I don't know, she's like a slave for fucking Dr. Drew or something.  Dr. Drew.  She's on the little panel there on Headline News.  And she was talking last night about the Trayvon Martin Zimmerman trial.  Don't tell her.  Let's just go cold.  Oh, yeah?  Okay. 
[01:05:00]  Jenny.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Colin Quinn.  How are you?  Hi, Jenny.  How are you?  How are you?  We're very happy that you got this gig with Dr. Drew, by the way.  I know, but you're upset with me.  What?  No, you look good on TV, by the way.  You look good on TV.  You did look pretty good.  Thanks, guys.  Gotta be honest.  Thank you.  That's very bad.  Your hair was lustrous.  Is that just nice?  Is that your natural color?  Not anymore.  Uh-oh.  Why would anyone choose to be a redhead?  You were that good?  I wouldn't.  I mean, I was born a redhead, but I'm an old lady. 
[01:05:30]  It looks good, though.  You still red?  You still red down there?  Yeah, I'm not, thankfully.  Well, first of all, there isn't much down there.  Nice.  Oh, what?  You got that fucking...  What do you got?  The mange?  Listen, in today's world, how many women have much there?  I don't know.  True, true.  A woman of your age, though, you'd think you'd just let it grow in at that point.  Do you clean up the butthole, though?  Yes.  Are you kidding me?  Wow.  There could be nothing there.  Yes, I've been lasered.  Oh, you've been lasered. 
[01:06:00]  Jenny's a fucking trooper, man.  You lasered your ass?  Yes.  God bless.  Did that hurt?  Yeah, that hurt.  But the underarms hurt the worst.  You know what that means?  I mean, she's had some little ass play going on.  Yeah, she...  No, no, I don't.  Why else would a girl want it to be?  Because for doggy style.  They want it to look good.  Is that it?  Yes.  All right, Carl.  Carl actually met my husband.  Carl, remember backstage at the Jerry Seinfeld thing?  Key party?  Oh, name dropping.  What's his name? 
[01:06:30]  No, no, no.  You would have to show...  Carl doesn't realize that he knows me, because we've met a bunch of times recently.  He doesn't know that.  He's looking at your picture.  And there's not even...  Huh?  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Anyway, he doesn't know my husband.  He doesn't know you.  He doesn't know you.  Anyway.  Go on.  Jenny.  He doesn't know who you are.  There's a picture of you two right in front of his face.  I do know him.  There's no recognition.  That event.  There's no recognition whatsoever in Carl's face.  That's what I was saying. 
[01:07:00]  It was at Jerry Seinfeld.  It was like...  Yeah, it's at the Jerry Seinfeld.  Jerry Seinfeld.  I don't know what this thing was for.  Oh, wow.  I remember.  It was for...  It was a stand-up for cancer.  Indeed.  Yeah, but he doesn't remember meeting you.  He remembers the event.  All right.  Didn't you hear what he just did there?  He was trying to help you out.  He remembers the cancer.  Because he's a nice guy.  Okay.  So, your take on this star witness surprised all of us here at the Opie and Anthony Show.  Really did.  We thought we were looking at a dummy. 
[01:07:30]  She was terrible, Jenny.  Listen, I don't think she's...  Do I think she's a super smarty pant person?  No, but I don't think she was calculating.  How...  Jenny, Jenny, Jenny.  Yes.  She was noxious.  How did you think that was a good witness for the prosecution?  How would you think a jury would look at this girl and go,  Yes, this is what we're looking for as far as the prosecution having to convey to us  that there was some type of murder going on that evening? 
[01:08:00]  How did that help the prosecution?  Well, I think what the prosecution is going to ultimately prove isn't that it was...  This was not a first-degree murder situation.  No, it wasn't second either.  This was that, in my opinion, that Zimmerman didn't like the look of Trayvon,  and Zimmerman was tracking him and following him,  and then Trayvon fought back, and then Zimmerman shot him.  Can I ask you a question, though?  You were on Dr. Drew's show, and I guess you look good.  But why...  Why? 
[01:08:30]  Like, why do you...  It's almost like you're spinning it to keep with the narrative.  Like, when you're talking about this girl being a good witness for the prosecution,  she was terrible.  Horrid witness.  She was caught lying under oath.  She was caught within...  She was caught lying in one of the depositions.  That's still a lie!  Yeah.  Because I understand that, but I think she didn't want to...  She...  I feel like she's having a hard time being there.  She was the last person to speak to him.  No, Jenny, I'm not trying to interrupt you.  I apologize.  And I do know that.  But what I mean is, when you're on Dr. Drew, and you're saying, I thought she was a good... 
[01:09:00]  Why is the press, or anybody in the press, keeping with this narrative?  She was an awful prosecution witness, even if you believe her.  Well, first of all, typically on that show, I don't keep with anyone else's perspective.  I keep with my own.  Okay.  In any other cases...  Rebel.  The red rebel, they call her.  The red rebel.  All right, easy there.  Easy, Jenny.  I'm just chatting.  I'm sorry.  Listen, I'm aware that it's not the popular opinion with many people, but I...  Yours is the popular opinion. 
[01:09:30]  Yours is the opinion on every fucking mainstream news.  With the press.  Not with the people.  With the press.  With the press.  The tweet of the night goes to Anthony when he said, the jury, she thought it was what  she was wearing in her ears.  Wearing in her ears.  What's that?  I gotta address the jury?  I like that Anthony said, holy shit, Jenny.  I laughed.  I laughed.  I liked it.  Do you hear what I said?  Oh, no, Chip.  What, Chippa?  She looks zooted.  She didn't look zooted.  She didn't look zooted at all.  What are you talking about?  Jenny, I just don't think she was a good witness for the prosecution. 
[01:10:00]  That's the bottom line.  You said she was...  Listen, this is the first...  This is like the third day of the trial today, I think.  And we'll see how it keeps going.  I think there's going to be a lot of...  There were going to be many witnesses brought, and we're going to see what the timeline was  and what was right, and let's see if she gets impeached.  Now, even your quick synopsis of what happened, what you believe happened, whatever it is,  that even isn't murder, too, you know. 
[01:10:30]  Murder also?  Yes.  Murder also.  Let's see what the judge's instructions are, ultimately, to the jury.  And let's see how it plays out.  I'm not sure that he's going to get convicted, but I do think that there was an...  I can't imagine that you guys don't think there was some element of racist something or other.  No, I don't see any racial...  The only racial thing I see here, on Zimmerman's part, is that every time he's called the cops,  the description has been a black male, because that's who's been breaking into the fucking houses over there. 
[01:11:00]  So why wouldn't you then think another black male walking in the neighborhood could be suspicious,  might want to find out where they're going, keep an eye on them, while you call the police,  and as you know, every murderer calls the cops and then tells them where you are at every minute.  That's the only racial element, is that perhaps George was doing some profiling,  but why has profiling become this bad word? 
[01:11:30]  If you walk by a goddamn pit bull every day and it bites you,  aren't you going to look at pit bulls a little different?  That's all I'm saying.  I understand that, and I totally value your perspective.  Of course you do.  The only concern is that when the cops told him to back down...  The cops never told him to back down.  A non-emergency police operator said,  Are you following him?  He said yes.  He then said,  We don't need you to do that. 
[01:12:00]  That instruction was given for the safety of George Zimmerman, period.  We don't need you to do that.  Doesn't mean stand down.  It doesn't mean he continued stalking.  And by the way, the very next word on the tape is George Zimmerman going,  Okay.  So where is this stalking and pursuit?  You're continuing this bullshit narrative that the press started with and is continuing with,  even though the facts of this case are completely contrary to every fake, racist, race-baiting story that the news is putting out there. 
[01:12:30]  Well, this is what I'll say.  I'll say that I hope that the system works in this trial,  and I hope that whatever truth is, the actual truth comes out, and I hope the right thing happens.  Jenny, I do believe you and the rest of mainstream media will be culpable to any riots that happen because of an acquittal,  because the layman that watches the news on this case, if there's an acquittal, will sit there and go, 
[01:13:00]  How the fuck was he acquitted when all this evidence is against them?  Because they're not reporting the evidence, they're reporting the fake story that they got from day one,  and they're not telling the people that need to know that he was justified in a self-defense shooting.  They're not telling the people.  So then when they acquit him, they're going to go,  Oh, oh, why did they acquit the stalker that chased him when the police told him to stand down? 
[01:13:30]  Jenny Hut.  I mean, last night there wasn't anyone on the panel who was taking your perspective, but there have been.  So if you keep watching, you'll see there are some panelists who come on saying that.  This is the mentality where, and this is the media, and again, I know you're just doing your gig,  but, like, they dumped out of the words.  You look great.  You look terrific.  You guys don't look terrific. I know I'm going to hang up.  Jenny, no, no, no.  You look terrific.  You look good.  No, you look good on HD, too, which is very difficult for a lot of people who don't look good in high definition. 
[01:14:00]  You look really good.  Bring this up on Dr. Drew.  The makeup girl should get a huge raise.  She should.  She's a true artist.  That's spackle, baby.  What?  Bring this up on Dr. Drew.  How the press dumps out of the words.  The Red Rebel.  They dump out of the words.  Look out.  Nigga.  And they dump out of the word cracker.  Yes.  Because it was reported that Trayvon said it.  But when the word coon.  Hold on.  No, hold on.  Hold on.  Let me finish. 
[01:14:30]  I'm talking about the people you work for and how Anthony is saying that the media is culpable.  They dump those words because it was reported that Trayvon Martin said it.  But when they couldn't stop saying coon, when they thought that Zimmerman said it, they said coon over and over because it was reportedly coming from George Zimmerman.  Right.  But when it looked like Trayvon said something racist, the fucking press dumped it.  Or if they say it, they dismiss the dude quickly. 
[01:15:00]  It's like, hey, we said it.  Yeah.  Really.  Well, I think because the skew here in that way is trying to not blame the victim.  And so I think...  But not blame the victim.  Just being honest about what was said.  This is a court transcript.  Exactly.  I think the press at large in that way doesn't want to...  The kid is dead.  So he can't...  But listen to what you're doing.  You're justifying why they're dumping out of language on cable TV during a trial. 
[01:15:30]  Well...  There should be nothing off limits as far as language goes in that context.  That is the one context that everyone should agree you should let any language fly.  It's a news program.  It's a trial.  It's real.  I agree.  Any trial...  It's true.  Jenny, what we suggest is you drop a few N-bombs tonight in front of Dr. Drew.  Yeah, you should.  Let's spice this shit up a little bit.  All right?  I want to approach Ritz.  Yeah.  I want to approach the Ritz company with creepy-ass crackers.  Nice.  Wouldn't that be good?  You put a little cheddar on it.  I would like...  Have you guys talked Paula Deen yet? 
[01:16:00]  Well, if you get off the phone, we'll be able to start talking Paula Deen.  That's our next topic.  Yeah, shouldn't you be in makeup by now?  What time's the show?  What time's the show, Jenny?  We can go on Twitter at Jenny Hutton.  No, no, no.  What, Jenny?  All kidding aside, what do you got on Paula Deen?  I don't think she is a huge fan of the African-Americans, and I feel bad for her that she's lost everything  in her life, but I don't think she handled this correctly.  Because she may have said nigger 30 years ago. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, she told the truth, Jenny.  You're right.  She didn't handle it correctly.  She should have lied.  Yeah, you gotta lie.  She told the truth she should have lied.  I think yesterday when she was on the Today Show, and she said that she's used the n-word  one time in her whole life.  That's a lie.  Of course that's a lie.  Before yesterday's show.  Have you ever used it in your life?  That's not a word I use.  No, no.  I didn't say that.  Never.  Have you ever said it in your...  No, I don't...  Not...  I mean...  I don't believe anyone that says no.  Anyone that says they never said it in their life is lying.  Sure had to do the same fucking thing on our show.  You're lying.  No, some people never used it.  I can see some people... 
[01:17:00]  I'm not saying me.  Never said it?  I'm not saying me.  I'm not even saying used it.  Hey, listen.  There's a difference between using it and saying it.  I never used it, but I can't speak for this guy.  The 19-year-old Colin Quinn.  Young Carl.  You look good.  You look like fucking...  What's-his-face there from the 70s show?  Young Carl put up numbers.  You put up numbers.  I'm gonna go, guys.  I do use the word cracker a lot.  Yeah.  Good talking to you.  All right, Jenny.  Bye, everybody.  Congrats on the gig, for real. 
[01:17:30]  Bye.  There's another...  Well, goodbye.  Goodbye.  No, not you.  It's good.  There was another story in the news about that.  Let's say goodbye to the Red Rebel.  Goodbye.  That New Jersey home invasion, where that black guy is pummeling the shit out of a white woman  while her young baby is sitting on the couch next to him.  And then they spoke with the woman, and they spoke with the woman's husband, who was watching  it in a room with, like, eight police officers and stuff.  And now I'm saying, is it justified for that guy, the guy and the wife and everything, to 
[01:18:00]  call that guy a nigger that came into the house, beat his full wife?  Would that be justified?  If in the future he's asked, have you ever used the word nigger?  And he goes, yes, I have.  Here's the instance.  Would anyone hold him at fault?  Which blows the complete story, or the theory, that it's never appropriate to use that word.  It's absolutely appropriate right there.  And you know what?  I think very few black people would complain if they didn't.  But the ones that make the most noise would complain, and he'd be fucked. 
[01:18:30]  With their little white cohorts, yes.  And the white cohorts would be the worst.  Did he rape her, or was it just a beating?  No.  A fucking horrid beating.  What was it?  He wanted more money, and she didn't have it?  No.  He literally walked in and punched her.  He kicked in the door.  Watch.  He kicked in the door.  She's just sitting home at the door to watch the cartoons.  She stands up to see who kicked her, what happened to the door.  And she's like this, and she's just beating the shit out of a gun.  Beats the shit out of a gun.  Is the press covering this for the racial attack that it is?  No.  Wow.  No.  Just curious as to why. 
[01:19:00]  No, it's just some white...  And then he throws it down the stairs to the basement.  Fucking avid.  Fucking...  Oh, hit play.  What, does she have a nanny camera?  I don't know how many more hints I can give to Sam.  I go, did you see it, Jim?  I keep pointing.  Stupid Sam just sits there.  She's like, what the fuck is...  My daughter's right there on the couch.  My daughter's right there on the couch.  Get off.  What a...  What a savage. 
[01:19:30]  What a fucking savage.  If she would have had a gun...  She wouldn't have been able to get to it right there.  You know what?  No.  When she looked at him coming in the door, she could have pulled that fucker right out.  And he's...  What a fucking savage.  What a fucking savage.  He's choking her and throws her on the floor.  Look at this fucking animal.  What a fucking animal.  Kicks her in the face.  Throws her down the basement.  What a fucking animal. 
[01:20:00]  Throws her down the fucking stairs.  Yeah, but don't...  Choke hold.  Yeah.  He's choking her.  Yeah.  There you go.  Lovely.  There's a daughter.  How old's the daughter?  Three.  Three.  She's just sitting there in shock.  The poor kid.  It's fucking savage.  He keeps running upstairs.  And it's in Melbourne, which I believe is near the awful community you came from.  Oh.  Awful community.  She's fucking, like, half unconscious. 
[01:20:30]  She's trying to get up.  She's rolling on the floor.  She's trying to protect her daughter.  Yeah.  Now he comes back down and kicks her in the face.  Look at this fucking savage animal.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Can you imagine, as a husband, having to watch this?  He throws her down the steps?  Yeah.  This fucking animal. 
[01:21:00]  Now...  Now, after you watch that...  And that was him leaving?  Wouldn't it have been nice if perhaps somebody had been driving through the neighborhood, seen  this guy walking around, maybe even deemed him as suspicious at some point because of  his action, whatever, and called the police and kept an eye on him to see if he went into  someone's fucking house?  Perhaps?  You can't...  Again, the disgust I have is the way they will cover this or the lack of coverage they'll 
[01:21:30]  give it.  Exactly.  It's horrible.  Well, I mean, the saddest...  The most egregious example is the lack of coverage of that Marine case.  Yes.  They probably talked about that.  Huge.  The fucking Marine and his wife that were killed?  It was a robbery.  It was just a robbery.  It was a robbery.  And no, the guy didn't get a promotion.  That was what it was.  Right, right.  But at the same time, they wanted to not make it a racial story, but they scrawled racial  slurs on the wall.  They wrote nigger on the wall to make it look like it was the Klan.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, they did?  Yes.  The black guys wrote nigger to make it look like it was the Klan. 
[01:22:00]  Ah.  But the press...  It was totally racial.  You'll never know about that because the press wouldn't fucking report on it.  They won't go near it.  They don't go near shit like that.  It's terrible.  They're fucking terrible, man.  It's an amazing double standard.  That guy, by the way, is still on the loose.  They'll get him.  They're still on the loose.  What a horrible...  Is she okay?  Yeah, what kind of injuries?  Yeah, she got beaten up pretty good.  Yeah.  And, you know, mentally, oh, yeah, she'll be all healed.  But then, you know what the rest of her fucking life is like mentally? 
[01:22:30]  Fucking savage.  And her daughter, the fucking poor kid sitting there, the husband who's got to watch this  and be like, oh, I wasn't fucking there to protect my wife?  It fucks their whole lives up.  Then there was an ADT alarm truck parked in front of the house the next day installing it.  I'm like, oh, what?  Installing it against those white people in the commercials?  The white guy that comes in with the fucking...  With the Hamburglar mask on and the fucking bag? 
[01:23:00]  Ah!  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Ah!  Jesus.  Ah, please.  That video's horrific.  Oh, it's unbelievably brutal.  I knew it was bad.  I avoided it, to be honest with you.  It's so bad.  Because I knew it was horrendous, but...  So bad.  Seeing it, holy fuck.  And that, you know, in New Jersey right now is going through a fucking legislation for  new gun laws, and it looks like Christy's going to fucking bow to these cocksuckers.  And there's an instance where, you know, you have to be allowed to protect yourself in 
[01:23:30]  your own home.  You have to.  No, I mean, the door was locked.  The guy kicked in the front door.  Kicked the fucking door in.  Oh, he did.  Who's protecting you against people kicking your fucking door in?  No, exactly.  There wasn't a cop there.  There wasn't a fucking Governor Christie standing there running block for that woman.  No, exactly.  And he went upstairs at one point where perhaps she could have reached a weapon if she was  allowed to have one, if she wanted one.  Yeah.  You know... 
[01:24:00]  Or either way, he could have done anything there, you know.  He could have done a lot worse, even.  This nanny cam could have caught a fucking murder.  It could have happened right there.  Or a rape or something.  It's just horrible.  It was brutal.  It's almost lucky that the savage beating is all that happens.  What a fucking animal, this guy.  He's just a fucking savage animal.  No regard.  No regard for human life.  No empathy for anything.  No thought of consequence.  It's a savage animal.  Instead of... 
[01:24:30]  Like, you didn't need to do that.  He didn't need to beat her.  Out of fear of safety for her and her daughter, she would have gotten him what he wanted.  Of course.  There was no need for that.  He ran right in and pummeled her.  Like an animal would run.  Like a fucking wild animal would run in.  I think...  Can we give Jim Norton the understatement of the day?  There was no need for that.  But I mean...  I needed a laugh.  No need for that.  You didn't laugh there.  Thanks.  Jesus Christ.  Thanks, Aunt Irma. 
[01:25:00]  Let's move on to Paula Dane.  Paula Dane.  Yes, exactly.  Paula Dane...  Yeah, but Paula Dane is on the Today Show.  Why would she say the N-word three years ago?  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the problem.  Jesus Christ.  It's ridiculous.  It's insane out there.  It's ridiculous.  It's insane.  I'm talking just about the media.  I swear to God.  They're insane.  The media is the problem.  They're insane.  We're living in weird times.  So Paula Dane went on the Today Show, that red-faced idiot from her apology tapes. 
[01:25:30]  She's an idiot, but what about...  Can we please talk about the righteous indignation of Matt Lauer?  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  I do.  Did he?  You're being...  Matt, you're being glib.  He's like this.  I mean, did you in fact say this?  Instead of going, hey, we all know it's bullshit.  Yeah.  He has to play his stupid part.  Oh, my God.  But he seems to revel in it.  I know.  How does he sleep at night, though?  Probably very comfortably. 
[01:26:00]  He knows better.  Very wealthy.  I guarantee he's...  He seems to revel in the borgata of the...  All right.  Well, we can start with...  Yes, casino.  He, you know, he's showboating again, and...  And his act trumps anyone's that he...  You want to start from the top or, like, go right to the are you a racist question?  Let's go to are you a racist.  It literally sounds like are you now or have you ever been from...  Right, right. 
[01:26:30]  Or fucking...  Or like McCarthy.  It's like McCarthyism.  Are you a communist?  Yes.  Now it's a racist.  You mean what I just said?  I have to use the actual term.  Are they...  I think you're talking about fucking are you now or have you been a homosexual from  Full Metal Jacket?  No, no.  Or from Clockwork Garden, sorry.  I think you're doing a movie line.  No, it's from...  That's how they've said that.  Have you?  Well, I don't remember.  That was your high school days.  How am I supposed to know?  Oh, shit.  Swimble.  Right now as we sit here, it seems to me an informal jury of your peers and your fans  and your critics and your business associates are weighing the question, is Paula Deen a racist? 
[01:27:00]  So I'll ask it to you bluntly.  Are you a racist?  Whoa.  Watch out for Matt Lauer.  Yes, Matt.  I am a racist.  You're not in the Panjshir Valley interviewing the head of the Al-Qaeda.  But you're going to get hardcore and in-depth.  Idiot.  Idiot.  Ah, shit.  No, I'm not.  By birth, by choice, by osmosis, you don't feel you have racist tendencies.  What a country.  What a country. 
[01:27:30]  Can you believe this?  This is more than TV.  It's...  It's like fucking white people scolding each other to deflect attention from themselves.  Oh, it's like Vonnegut.  Don't you think everyone's racist to an extent?  Um, it depends who you call racist.  Yes, exactly.  I mean, you might have just a little bit or a lot.  It depends who you call racist.  And this makes it worse.  Worse?  I can't.  It depends who you call racist.  I mean, I like to define racism, which nobody could do in this country either, by the way.  I'm called racist every night on Twitter for just criticizing black people. 
[01:28:00]  And then, oh, you're a racist.  And they honestly think that I'm being a racist.  So their definition is any white person that criticizes a black person is a racist.  Then there's people that need, you know, burning crosses and fucking clan hoods to define a racist.  So, yeah, the definition, it's just not there.  The definition is very all over the place.  Yes.  Don't feel you have racist tendencies.  No.  As a child, I was raised in a home.  Oh, God.  That accent never good when you're being asked if you're a racist. 
[01:28:30]  Let me tell you one thing.  I've been so kind to the negros growing up.  I said nigger as a noun, not an adjective.  Exactly.  You know, growing up with the little picking in his running around the yard, I think it's  That accent, by the way, is very hard to defend.  The other question I'd like to ask is when they do destroy her whatever empire, which  is ludicrous that she should have an empire, but she has an empire to begin with. 
[01:29:00]  How many black employees does she have that are going to be unemployed?  Right, right, right.  That's the other question.  Yes.  And how do they feel?  They're like, I'd rather have my job and have her have said the N-word during a bank robbery  than be unemployed and part of the big solution.  Yeah.  I don't like your impression of her employees.  That sounded, that was you doing her employees.  I didn't like that.  I was doing kind of the, this guy went to one of those black colleges in Atlanta.  I went to Morehouse or to Howard.  Howard. 
[01:29:30]  Howard's the go-to.  He's right.  My impression was pretty ludicrous.  She was robbed at gunpoint.  Am I right?  Right.  Is that what happened?  Yes.  By a black guy.  And she came home and said, I need a dick around.  I'm going to give you the store right by his.  She's got that great voice like three pack a day.  My father tolerated bad grades.  He would tolerate maybe me breaking a curfew.  Well, this is really irrelevant. 
[01:30:00]  How's Matt looking at this point?  Matt looks like he always looks.  Bewildered and hostile.  If you have been unkind and others or have been unkind, your butt is going to be mine.  All right.  But you raised your right hand.  Yes, I did.  And you swore under oath.  And you spoke honestly, which you should never do.  That was the crime.  That was the lesson we all learned.  Don't just lie.  Here's the lesson.  Yeah, you can't speak honestly.  Never be honest.  Ever.  Never be honest about the race, especially because you will be hung.  Right.  I'm glad we all learned that, Anthony. 
[01:30:30]  But anyway.  You have used a word that is the most offensive word you can use to describe an African man.  Oh, he's the worst.  You asked about this wedding.  This wedding you wanted to plan.  That plantation-style wedding.  Whether you used it.  Well, maybe the plantation-style wedding was pretty much.  A little over the top.  It hurts her case.  A little rough.  A little over the top.  Not good.  A nice period piece.  A little rough.  Hey, you know, they did it in Django.  Yeah.  It worked in Django.  It's like, I want a Django type of vibe.  Django.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  So, okra, we have them sit in a separate section called the field house, and then we're going  to sit up here.  Now, where's the slave hot box going to be for the big ceremony?  Oh, Jesus.  Is that going to be out there in the yard?  It's a hot box slash barbecue pit that she had.  It's kind of a bad taste.  I know.  And she goes, I like the fact that she goes, obviously, La Femme, she goes, oh, the media  will be all over me for that one.  Yeah, kind of.  Yeah, I think so.  Jeez, Paula. 
[01:31:30]  Or not.  So, how does someone use the N-word, whether in anger or in a joke or in private?  The most offensive word to African Americans and not be considered a racist.  When they're using it, they're using it constantly.  The day I used that word, it was a world ago.  It was 30 years ago.  Listen to this groveling.  She should have said, Matt, I'm going to hold a gun in your face right now, Matt.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And now you call me the B-word.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:32:00]  How can you say I'll kill you and not be considered a murderer?  Sometimes you say things in anger, Matt.  And this is the point we're at in society where now you're responsible for something you said  30 years ago.  Yeah.  That's fucking nuts.  That's the most offensive word for African Americans.  30 years ago.  Look at Colin 30 years ago.  He's unrecognizable.  Do you have a picture of what you looked like 30 years ago?  Yeah, he tweeted yesterday.  Really?  Good head of hair.  Colin looks like Philippe Cousteau.  He did.  Back in the 70s.  Somebody said I looked like John Holmes. 
[01:32:30]  We got old John Holmes in you.  Yes.  The old Colin.  You do from like the face down to the chin.  And then you look nothing like John Holmes.  Oh, look at Colin.  Hopefully you'll wind up like him.  So now we're all going to have to live perfect lives.  Oh, look at him.  It used to be what you were doing in the here and now.  But now we're going to go back 30 years.  30 years.  She says, nigger.  And it's fucking now resurfacing like she fucking buried a dead baby. 
[01:33:00]  Like Sling Blade.  Had to fucking dip that poor little feller.  You know?  Yeah.  Give me a break.  We look at it like it happened last week.  It's unbelievable.  It's maddening.  Carl, who's the guy next to you there?  Who's your buddy?  My friend Pooh.  I start talking.  Do you?  Were you guys smoking some weed?  Yeah, we probably smoked a little weed.  You look like a fucking 40-year-old homeless guy there.  Yeah, they said I looked like Tom from...  Tippy Tom.  Tippy Tom.  Good abs, though.  Carl had fucking abs.  Where were you?  The conk?  You look like a karate guy.  Were you in the conk? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Good arms.  I'll call him some guns.  No chest whatsoever.  But good fucking guns.  Oh, what a fucking...  He's got like a Bruce Lee body.  You got to get into him.  Jesus.  No chest, but everything else is kind of happening.  Yes, I wish you had a Brandon Lee body.  Wow.  Did you fight?  Did you fight back then?  He's Irish.  Of course he threw some fucking fists.  I would say I was talented at it, but yeah.  You threw?  Threw a few.  I wasn't good at it.  What were you doing right there?  It looks like you have missing teeth. 
[01:34:00]  Like, I can't connect you to that guy.  I was trying to be funny.  Were you crushing something on your head?  I was trying to be funny.  Like, hey, I was taking a picture.  Oh, like, like, oh, like, like, what were you doing?  A Sha-na-na pose?  Yeah.  Way to the beach.  Wow.  Yeah, I can't even see you in that picture.  It was a candid.  Like, you can't put that picture anywhere and say, guess who this celebrity is.  You kind of see him.  You're right.  Take a guess who this guy is, baby.  They recognized Pooh first. 
[01:34:30]  I knew that was coming.  Oh, God.  Is Pooh still alive?  Are you still friends with him?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've seen him.  I've seen him recently.  Um, Paula Deen was a teller at the time, this whole thing went down?  Yeah.  Yeah, real snitch.  That's a problem.  A shaking gun.  Because the man that had the gun to my head, unbeknowing to me, was my customer at the main office.  But didn't you also read that call that you used the word on other occasions?  No.  No.  Here's, wait a minute.  Let me just say something. 
[01:35:00]  This is a witch hunt.  He wanted to get past that story.  Right.  Yes, yes.  So fast.  Because he feels guilty inside because he knows it's all bullshit.  He's like, oh, let's move on to something else.  This is not part of the narrative.  People might accept that as a reasonable reason to use that word.  Of course they would.  All black people would accept it.  Yes.  Oh, black guy holding his fucking gun in your face.  All black people would accept it.  Are you kidding me?  Exactly.  So, oh, let's get past that to the point where you just said it because, you know, your fucking  guy was walking down the street. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, exactly.  What a slug cunt.  So you have, other than that, one time, in the bank, a robbery attempt.  Always hateable.  You're telling me you have never used the animal.  I have never.  I never.  They asked me in all of my 66 years on earth had I ever used it.  What the fuck is wrong with this country?  Can you believe this is happening?  Who gives a fuck?  I'm so insane.  So insane.  He was later caught.  Holy shit.  And I had gone out on a limb for him and gotten him alone and he was frightened that I was 
[01:36:00]  going to recognize him.  So reports that you were asked in that deposition whether you would use the N-word on other occasions  and said, he's like, forget the gun to my robber.  Of course.  That's the N-word.  That's the N-word.  That's what word you used.  I answered the question truthfully.  I'm amazed.  Man.  So you have never used the N-word.  Oh my God.  Shut up.  Oh my God.  It's not, it's just not a part of the N-word.  This country's finished.  He's an adult saying the N-word.  Yeah, what a country's finished. 
[01:36:30]  Fucking, what a fucking dripping, sanctimonious country.  It's a phony.  And he though, you can't even, he's every one of these motherfuckers.  He's just one of every one of these fuckers.  The insanity over this.  It's ridiculous.  Do you believe they were talking about a word?  The only people that should have an opinion on any of this are the mixed race, not Sam  types.  The mixed race.  They're not Sam's, we call them.  Wow.  I, I, I.  Wow. 
[01:37:00]  The way he was talking, you would think he was questioning her about a murder or, or  some kind of, uh, uh, Bernie Madoff and Fezzlement thing.  But when he's not in front of the cameras, he knows better.  That's what's frustrating to me.  Let me tell you something.  He doesn't think.  That's even more evil.  No shit.  He doesn't think that way when the cameras are off.  When Matt Lauer's driving home.  He plays his stupid fucking part.  Matt Lauer's driving home.  He goes through a toll booth.  The fucking guy in front of him's got easy pass.  The gate doesn't go up.  Holy shit.  Now he's waiting.  Matt Lauer wants to get home. 
[01:37:30]  He's fucking waiting.  And he sees a black guy that works for the fucking bridge and tunnel walking almost  backwards.  He's walking so slowly over to that fucking gate to grab his easy pass and put it on that  little thing to get the gate up.  He's thinking that word.  He thinks it.  He don't say it.  It might even be fleeting.  But he's thinking it for a second.  There are scenarios where everybody at some point thinks it.  It's just a...  Because it's out there. 
[01:38:00]  You can't not think it.  But I'm saying, but even if people don't think it, it's almost...  It's not even about...  It's once again focusing on this word in any way.  Don't think it.  Right.  Don't think it.  Watch you think it.  Watch you think it in your head.  It's in your head.  Don't think it.  I know.  It's like a purple gorilla.  Don't think it.  Purple gorilla.  Don't think it.  And then all of a sudden you think it.  These people are phony.  They're phony.  They want you to believe that Matt Lauer has never even imagined saying that horrible word. 
[01:38:30]  He's a liar.  Stop it.  What a fraud, man.  People are saying that she said it more than once 30 years ago.  I know.  I said it.  How many times?  How many times is it acceptable?  I don't know.  How many times is it?  Someone's tweet said you're wrong.  She said it more than one time 30 years ago.  I'm sure she did.  Look at her deposition transcript.  I know one thing.  All right.  So then she talks about how the youth are saying the word a lot.  I may have studied on it.  I may have used the word a few times.  I may have studied on it.  Let me ask you about this part of the deposition. 
[01:39:00]  We were asked whether, you were asked whether using the N-word in telling a joke was hurtful.  And you said, quote, I don't know.  Most jokes are about Jewish people, rednecks, black folks.  I didn't make up the jokes.  They usually target, though, a group.  I can't myself determine what offends.  If you made a joke using the N-word, you might be a redneck.  And you might work for the Jews.  Aren't most jokes hurtful, if you really think about it?  Well, yeah.  It's hurtful to somebody.  One said the water's cold, the other said the water's deep. 
[01:39:30]  I believe one boy was from Arkansas.  What is he talking about?  All jokes are hurtful.  Right.  That's what makes him funny.  What is Matt talking about?  I told you what Jack Simmons.  Only black jokes are hurtful?  Jack Simmons once said.  Yeah.  When he was doing a joke about baby Jessica.  It was a while ago.  Oh, wow.  I'm not young.  And he goes, come on, folks.  Whenever they moan, come on, folks.  It's comedy.  Somebody's got to get hurt.  That's true.  And that's the truth.  Yes.  It's comedy.  And I don't like the fact you said it was baby Jessica, but it was really baby Lindbergh. 
[01:40:00]  That's hurtful.  Fucking home on Jefferson.  Hey, thank God baby Jessica, though, right?  Came out fine.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Did you make fun of baby Jessica ever in your life?  No, never.  No, you can't.  You can't make fun of that scene.  I submit to you, Greg.  You can't.  You can't make fun of that.  Norton just switches off because he was like a young wannabe comedian, hack, that watched  a few comedy specials and then he told his friends he had a baby Jessica joke for his  local dumb Monster Rain friends before he did comedy. 
[01:40:30]  I got that whole thing just now when he goes, do you ever make fun of baby Jessica?  You guys go, no.  He goes like, just back to his phone.  No, I was just kidding because it was like the Paul Dino.  I was scolding him.  Have you ever made fun of a baby in a pipe?  No.  Fucking Matt Lauer.  What offends another person?  That last sentence gets me.  I can't myself determine what offends another person.  That really hits to my heart.  That hurts my heart, Matt.  He's saying now that her answer that I don't have any, I don't really know what offends another 
[01:41:00]  person, which is a reasonable answer.  He now sits there and goes, how do you not know what I'm saying?  He goes, that really gets me.  Yeah, yeah, that got him.  Hey, that was hardcore.  First of all, you're allowed to offend other people.  It's amazing.  You're really allowed to do it.  I know, but not Matt.  Used to be allowed to.  Not Matt Lauer.  Last sentence gets me.  I can't myself determine what offends another person. 
[01:41:30]  Do you have any doubt in your mind that African Americans are offended by the Norton?  No, not with how much they use it.  It's nigga this, nigga that every fucking day out there.  Not that you can't listen to a song without it.  Right.  Right.  That's what confuses a lot of people.  Stop it.  It's not this fucking word that you say.  Stop it.  Stop it.  You say the word.  It's like saying good.  It's like using the word hoa. 
[01:42:00]  Word?  I don't know, Matt.  I have asked myself that so many times because it's very distressing for me to go into my kitchens  and I hear what these young people are calling each other.  I can't even use the Aunt Jemima syrup anymore.  She's never joined in on that language.  No.  She's joined in.  She's got eight young black dudes working in.  It's very distressing.  Yeah, no kidding.  Yo, pass a call on the nickel.  Stupid man.  I was like, ah, that's just what I was going to say. 
[01:42:30]  All right, Dan.  Yo, shut the fuck up.  All right.  Yeah, she's going to participate.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, Jesus.  It really is a ludicrous country.  This is insanity.  This is like from the onion.  Listen to the rest of this.  It's amazing.  It's an amazing clip here.  It's Orwellian.  Yes.  No.  Absolutely not.  It's very distressing.  It's very distressing for me because I think that for this problem to be worked on, that these young people. 
[01:43:00]  You're right, though.  The accent is hilarious.  It really takes a lot of good.  These young people, especially the colored ones, like my husband and the sheriff, both tried to pursue that person.  And I'm sorry, but Emmett Tillis did win at a white woman.  You bust up a chifro, you bust it up and you leave. 
[01:43:30]  You got to hear the last thing.  Yeah, let's hear what she's saying here.  These young people are going to have to take control and start showing respect for each other and not throwing that word at each other.  It makes my skin crawl.  How about the fact that Paula Deen, who's like this multi-famous chef, owns all these restaurants, she walks in the kitchen and these brothers don't even flinch.  They're just looking at each other. 
[01:44:00]  That's a hot sauce, nigga.  You're hogging it.  Yeah, I'm doing it, Ms. Paula.  Hey, man.  Yo, where am I supposed to put this roast, nigga?  You ain't make no room for my hair.  But she didn't come off very good either.  She came off kind of like an ass.  But she had no...  She's like, I want to say...  No, she had no reason that she should have to come off in any way whatsoever.  She sounded phony, but we saw it happen when she was honest.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's trying a little too hard.  That's a good point.  She's trying a little too hard. 
[01:44:30]  She's a little desperate now.  You mean to tell me you don't know that African-Americans do not like...  They're offended by the word that is used in every song and every movie and every...  It's ridiculous.  Tweet at Matt Lauer, if you know.  M. Lauer on Twitter.  Matt Lauer.  Yeah.  You hear the story about the grandson?  What happened?  What's your troll down there today?  Uh-oh.  How old is he?  I want to read you something that Columbia professor John McWhirter wrote for Time Magazine's website. 
[01:45:00]  He is, by the way, African-American.  He wrote,  People of Dean's generation can neither change the past nor completely escape their roots in it any more than the rest of us.  They can apologize and mean it as Dean seems to.  They also deserve credit for owning up to past sins as Dean did candidly when she could have easily, shall we say, whitewashed her.  Do you ever wish, Paula, that when you raised your right hand and swore to tell the truth in that deposition that you'd fudged the truth? 
[01:45:30]  You wouldn't have been the first person to ever lie.  Hell yes, I do.  Given the fallout that you've seen over the last week, do you ever wish you'd fudged the truth?  Yeah.  No, because there's a couple of kinds of people that I don't like.  Liars.  We know one group.  And it's thieves and liars.  Oh.  And I'll tell you a conversation.  Uh-oh.  Here we go. 
[01:46:00]  That I had with my seven-year-old grandson the other day.  Oh, no.  He had spent the night with me and I allowed him to stay up later in his bedtime.  Oh, boy.  I said, J.W.  And I said, Jack, honey, you've got Guinea in trouble.  Guinea?  With mommy and daddy when you told them that I had let you stay up late.  This sounds like an emotional story.  Anyway, Paula, what else you got?  And he looked up at me and he said, Guinea, I don't tell lies. 
[01:46:30]  Yes, he does.  He's seven years old.  Of course he does.  He's probably playing with himself the minute he left the room.  Take that, stupid.  That interview yesterday is everything that's wrong right now.  Oh, yeah.  The phoniness of what goes on.  The phoniness.  Orwellian, you're right.  This is Orwellian.  It is Orwellian.  Let's get to the end of this because it's so ridiculous. 
[01:47:00]  I swear to God.  And then we can move on.  We've got like four or five more amazing clips from this thing.  Oh, please.  Oh, you guys got to have some more hot topics.  I'm serious.  We've got a lot of stuff going on.  We're rolling.  We're going to move on.  We're going to study that couples that...  Oh, God.  Don't tell lies.  That's how I raised my children.  That's how I was raised.  And that's how my grandchildren are being raised.  Fine.  And I know as well as I'm sitting here with you, I know how I treat people. 
[01:47:30]  I know my love for people.  And I'm not going to sit here and tell everything that I have done.  I want information.  Blue Star.  But people of color, I'm not going to do it.  Somebody else can tell that.  All right.  There you go.  Wow.  The whole country.  I feel like maybe I'm seeing it wrong.  It's so overwhelmingly idiotic.  It's sickening.  I can't believe it's happening.  It's easier to see it like everyone else.  Yes.  Because it's so enraging.  The dishonesty of it.  It's so easy just to go along with it and say, fuck it. 
[01:48:00]  Jump in the fucking river and just go with it with everyone else.  Why is there this need to walk on eggshells when addressing any issue about black people  when you're white?  Why is it so difficult and scary and you can't say this?  It's a legacy.  The second you criticize Obama on his policies, you have to preface it with this big, long  fucking preamble about, you're not raised.  It's a legacy.  Yeah? 
[01:48:30]  Yes.  And it's also.  His an arm.  See?  Fucking call me a.  Holy shit.  Good luck topping that.  Here's a legacy of.  I mean, it's the legacy goes back to the beginning.  You know, it's just it all comes out of the whole slavery thing, out of the whole Jim Crow  thing and out of the whole like people still get to a lot of people get to pay lip service  to like like people that say that we interviewed her yesterday. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  They get to feel like, OK, I'm on the side of the angels.  But if you walked around their studio, I'm sure it's ninety five percent white, just like  the headquarters of any, you know, I'm right.  I guarantee Paula Deen prop.  I guarantee like I have any idea what I'm saying.  But I bet I bet right now.  I'm not a bet man.  I bet she has a high percentage of blacks working for her.  Sure.  NBC has working for them.  Yeah, you're right.  I'd like to look into that.  Yeah.  Sam.  Investigation.  One of the interns do it.  Anyway, guys, that's how badly the fucking we're all kind of reeling from what the country 
[01:49:30]  did earlier.  That's what it's like if after slavery and then there was like all the fucking the 40  acres and whatever it was, it was promised to not deliver all.  It's not just black people that are still fucked up.  White people are still fucked up over it.  Right.  But no, no, that's why we're all walking around in a field, bumping into each other  and black people go, I can't get my shit together.  I'm a victim.  And white people go, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's his fault.  It's his fault.  It's his fault.  It might fault.  It's his fault.  It's his fault.  It's his fault. 
[01:50:00]  We are paying the price.  And that's what this, that's what I've been kind of thinking this white sickness is,  is we, they, I forget that it's not just black people that got fucked up by that.  But now there's this whole generation of white people that feels entitled and better  than, but feels guilty that they feel better than.  So they don't know how to do it.  So they just overcompensate by being overly polite.  And Bush's quote about the soft bigotry of lowered expectations is fucking brilliant.  And that's where we are.  So white people are fucked up by it too. 
[01:50:30]  Oh man.  So what do we do?  How do we fix this?  Generationally, it will fix itself.  It's just going to take time.  It'll fix itself.  It will eventually.  It's going to take many, many years.  This should have happened a hundred years ago.  Oh please.  This process should have happened a hundred years ago.  Maybe another hundred years, it'll be a little better.  We've got to go to Matt in Virginia.  This will sum it up.  Yeah.  Is he laying in front of someone's door?  This guy's got a great idea for a TV show.  Okay.  Matt, go ahead.  Matt.  Yeah, Chris Hansen's new Catcher Racist.  Instead of Catcher Predator, we should get a show. 
[01:51:00]  Hilarious.  Catcher Racist.  Great.  Hi.  Right.  Come on in.  I have some sweet tea over here.  We'll talk about the Negroes.  Come on in.  I have a mint julep over here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, I see you're here to talk of race.  Some of your transcripts.  Did you hear the one about the colored boy?  God, that's fucking brilliant.  I wish I had an idea.  That would be a wonderful show.  Who can we pitch it to? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  CC?  SNL will do it?  Catcher Racist.  Let's go to CC with this idea.  We are so fucking fixated on this issue.  White people really aren't allowed to talk about it unless you're begging for forgiveness.  Or scolding another white person.  Or scolding another white person about it.  Do you know, you never, and you would never see Matt Lauer speaking out against blacks.  Never.  On their side of it where, you know, this disproportionate number of criminals and what seemingly has 
[01:52:00]  a complete lack of embarrassment in the community.  I think embarrassment is a great tool to keep people in check.  Like just a communal embarrassment.  Whereas something happens, when you have Chicago and there's 17 shootings, five deaths  in one fucking day on a Saturday night, there should be this communal embarrassment.  Embarrassment, yes.  There should be a communal embarrassment of the community. 
[01:52:30]  Of the community.  Yeah.  I can't deliver a kid from my own goddamn neighborhood.  Oh.  75% illegitimacy.  There should be embarrassment there.  There should be embarrassment.  Fucking father's just leaving.  Well, there should be, these things should all be being discussed at the very least.  Oh, yeah.  But you know what?  You'll never see Matt Lauer.  You'll see Matt Lauer bitching at a white woman for saying niggas 30 years ago.  Oh, of course.  But why won't he say, you know, there is quite an amount of violent crime in the black community. 
[01:53:00]  He'll never say that.  But here's what it's like.  It's like when your girlfriend says, did you cheat on me?  And you've cheated on her.  It's really hard to look her in the eye and go, no.  Like, they're afraid that if they look something, like, they address it head on, their own fucking  sickening thoughts or their own closet paternalism is going to come out.  It's all a way to deflect attention from their own feelings of superiority.  It's fucking embarrassing. 
[01:53:30]  I don't think it all is, but I think it's a good part of it.  You're right.  There's a lot of psychological, there's a lot of Jungian shit going on here.  Yeah, man.  It's crazy.  On everybody's part.  Not mine.  Black and white.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I think we know where you stood when the example you used, you cheating dog.  That's not true.  By the way, if you people could have seen, if you ever want to see a throwback to the horrible  times, when they actually had those, like, you know, those, like, Al Jolson type, you 
[01:54:00]  know, Matt.  Yes, yes.  Jim's expression when he was saying how he, not me cheating on his girlfriend, was truly  Amos and Andy would have been embarrassed by the overacting in that.  Fair enough.  His eyeballs were popping out of his head.  It was Garfield-ish.  We have to break.  We got guests backing up.  What?  Yeah, we got, uh...  Who do we have today?  We got Burt Marcus next.  Oh, we have Carl.  We have two girls after that.  And then we got some penthouse girls coming in. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, I'm not leaving.  I want to see the penthouse girls.  Yeah, you guys.  You're here for the fucking duration.  Colin Quinn's doing the one-man show, Unconstitutional.  I've seen it.  Jimmy's seen it.  It's amazing.  I love this one-man show.  It made me sick to say, but it really was...  Like, this is how good it is.  All the comics, even when Colin's not around, are saying, like, ugh, it was fucking really good.  Like, it's weird when...  You guys are mad it's so good.  Nah, but it's a weird...  Don't you want Carl to succeed, though?  Of course you do, but we all tease each other and go, ah, it stinks. 
[01:55:00]  You know, Keith, of course.  But even Keith...  We like to rib each other.  That son of a bitch is at another level.  Like, you know, that's the way people talk to you.  It's great.  It really is one of the fucking greatest pieces of stand-up I've ever seen.  It's perfect for our time, right, Colin?  Perfect for our time.  It talks about, actually, a lot of this racial stuff, too.  Yeah, but from a very guilty-wide point of view.  It's a wonderful show.  I think the tickets are going to go really fast, so I hope our listeners start getting  their tickets.  Yeah.  It's at the Cherry Lane Theater, July 4th through the 23rd.  Get your tickets now by Googling Colin Quinn Unconstitutional. 
[01:55:30]  See, I was listening.  I was paying attention.  Yeah, thanks.  That's the way to sell tickets, right?  Yeah.  All right.  After these messages, the OPN Anthony Show will derive back.  This is the OPN Anthony Show.  Got Colin Quinn in studio.  Colin Quinn is doing Unconstitutional.  Come on, let's get our tickets, people.  Yeah.  Google Colin Quinn and Unconstitutional.  It's going to be at the Cherry Lane Theater here in New York City, July 4th through the 23rd. 
[01:56:00]  All right, we got that going on.  Yeah.  Why is E-Rock wearing a casual shirt today?  Hi, Bert.  Are you in on the whole shirt thing with E-Rock?  Yeah, yeah.  Hi, Bert.  What's up, Bert?  What's up, buddy?  How are you, man?  I'm amazing.  How are you guys?  Good, good.  We're amazing, too, Bert Marcus.  How to make money selling drugs.  Whoa.  There's a buzz on this fucking documentary.  Big time buzz.  I've heard about it.  You haven't heard about it?  Yeah.  You haven't?  I have heard about it, yeah. 
[01:56:30]  See?  Colin Quinn even knows about it, Bert Marcus.  Maybe on the line or something.  I don't remember.  It's a story about you, yeah?  Well, you tell me if this guy would sell drugs.  This night...  When I was 19.  Very adorable.  I was a little bit...  We're going back a little bit.  I was a little bit of a...  You know...  Colin Quinn's been bragging.  You exfoliate.  You look the same.  I moved product.  He's bragging, showing that old picture of himself to everybody today?  I think it's an awful photo.  Oh.  Well, you're only one man.  What kind of drugs were you doing back then, Carl? 
[01:57:00]  Mescaline, Speed, Pot.  Yeah.  Just about those...  Most of that stuff.  Once I wanted a little acid, but that was amazing.  A little acid.  It was a big mescaline period.  Quaaludes were big.  You know?  Two and alls.  6.97s.  Crossroads.  I could go on.  I could go on.  And you tapped out at 24, right?  Yeah, I did.  It's been a while.  Did you ever sell?  Yeah.  I meant Bert.  Oh, Bert.  You know, with a name like Bert, I need all the help I can get.  But no, I never got into the selling thing.  A lot of friends. 
[01:57:30]  Obviously, a lot of people I was around.  So the documentary is about how to make money selling drugs.  Do you interview drug dealers?  What exactly is it about?  You know, we try to interview people from all sides.  And all perspectives of the war on drugs.  And I think that's what makes this documentary different.  It's set up like a video game.  And so for all the gamers out there, especially for that new generation that's kind of seen the same rhetoric and facts thrown down your throat for the last some odd years, this is kind of a very interactive thing for that younger generation to get in and see how they can get involved and hopefully end one of the biggest public policy failures in our recent history. 
[01:58:00]  We're not going to end the drug thing.  We can only get the awareness out there.  And with awareness is the only way we can kind of instigate the action.  And so hopefully we did it in a fun way.  And everybody's involved in different ways.  So it was a blast to make, but very, very eye-opening.  You got some really good people in this.  I mean, you know, Woody Harrelson, Susan Sarandon, Eminem, 50 Cent, Russell Simmons, David Simon, Arianna Huffington. 
[01:58:30]  How did you get all these people for this?  You know, obviously the topic alone, people are super reluctant.  You know, they don't want to be associated with drugs.  And what's cool about this was each of these people, once they kind of saw the direction we were going in and seeing a new perspective as opposed to the same stuff, like I said.  And most documentaries are made for people who like documentaries or arthouse flicks.  And, you know, our goal was to really make this for people who don't typically see those films.  Right.  And, you know, all these guys had their own experiences. 
[01:59:00]  You know, 50 was a dealer since he was eight years old.  You know, he got in it through his mom, actually.  You know, Eminem obviously dealt with, you know, from the addiction side.  So it's been fun.  Yeah, we've had 50 Cent on the show talking about it.  He's an amazing man.  He's a businessman now.  Business.  Like a real businessman.  Business.  Yeah.  But back in the day, man, he was...  Let's act like he's Henry Ford.  Running the streets of St. Albans.  Here's 11. 
[01:59:30]  Fucking Kyle.  He's the most profitable hip-hop...  Thank God Kyle's here today.  Huh?  He's actually the most profitable hip-hop guy alive right now.  Not through hip-hop, but...  Was it a damn...  Water.  Yeah, vitamin water.  So that water thing coming.  I should have got in on that one.  No kidding.  Somebody would tell me that.  I would say, get out of here.  Nobody's going to drink that.  Did he really make $100 million from that?  He has never said how much.  Probably more.  Rumor was $100 million.  That's how much you know.  That was $100 million.  He laughs and kind of sort of, you know...  It's a shitload. 
[02:00:00]  A shitload.  From water.  God.  God.  Why didn't we think of that?  Because we didn't.  We were too busy making dick jokes here on the radio.  You're the dick water.  I always blew off the financial part of the paper.  What about the other stuff?  What about that gunk skulk?  Goat skunk.  Remember?  Little Wayne had that water.  I don't think that did as well.  That didn't do as well, no.  Did Little Wayne have water?  Yeah, it was called like goat skunk weed sex water.  Nobody bought it.  Why did you buy that?  Worst name ever. 
[02:00:30]  He wasn't as good.  Oh, my God.  He was kind of jacked.  So people were like, oh, maybe I'll be healthy like him, you know.  I should have hired you.  Yeah.  You got to interview drug dealers in prison?  You know, yeah.  We interviewed guys both in prison and people.  The people that were in prison actually didn't make the cut.  But the people, most of the drug dealers we had were, you know, big.  Everybody from the street dealers to, you know, guys who are running and making 200 million in the year.  Wow.  Who did you get?  So it says here you got Rick Ross, like Freeway Rick Ross, not the rapper, which I had to ask in the break who he was. 
[02:01:00]  He's like a legendary guy who's.  Yeah, he's notorious for, you know, he basically is coined with the guy that, you know, created crack and brought crack to America.  Yeah.  So he, you know, he served many years in jail and we got him actually.  You got in on the crack thing before it was crack?  Fuck.  What are we doing wrong, Carl?  We missed that and vitamin water.  Fuck.  We could have got in on the crack thing before it was called crack.  The CIA pipeline.  Rick Ross. 
[02:01:30]  How much time did he do?  I think he had a 20, 25 year sentence, but he served five years.  Why only five out of the 20, 25?  He served five.  I mean, the way that it works now with having guys as informants and setting people up.  I mean, it's a very complicated web.  But he wasn't an informant.  He wasn't.  He was actually set up.  Oh, okay.  He got out through a very, it's revealed in the film, but it's a very interesting, his situation's actually very interesting.  Because he, you know, he's coined as the guy that brought crack. 
[02:02:00]  But, you know, in his local neighborhood, he's like a local Robin Hood.  You know, he was handing out money to all the people that needed it.  Like Escobar was doing it in Colombia.  I think if you're the guy that brings crack to America, maybe you should stay in jail a little longer than five years.  Don't you think?  You know, it's interesting.  I mean, wow.  That says something about the prison system, I think.  Well, the prison system's a whole nother, you know, a whole nother beast.  You know, one of the fastest growing businesses in the country right now.  God bless, right?  We're locking everybody up.  That's what I say. 
[02:02:30]  Throw them all in the slam.  That's what I call it.  The slam.  It's scary.  What is Rick Ross doing now that he's out?  He's actually doing a lot of public speaking and talking to young people and explaining how he got into it and how, you know, how our system works.  Oh, now that he made his money, he's going to tell everyone not to do it, right?  He lost all his money.  Oh, he ended up losing his empire?  Yeah.  His crack empire?  Yeah, the funny thing is he was really involved with, like, building churches and schools and hospitals. 
[02:03:00]  I mean, there was a lot of good, actually, behind him as well.  Well, you know, obviously.  So he took his crack money and he was building churches and schools and hospitals?  He definitely was supporting them, yeah, in his local community.  All right.  Gave him back to the community.  That's not too bad.  That's what Pablo Escobar did in Colombia.  That's why they loved him so much.  He would build all kinds of things for the community.  And the guy, El Chapo, I think his name is, the guy that runs the Mexican Sinaloa cartel, same thing.  I mean, the people protect him because he puts so much money, so many people feel indebted to him that they don't look at him like he's this awful guy. 
[02:03:30]  They don't care what product he's pushing.  Yeah, they look at him like he's putting money here and, you know, we'll look out for him.  Making things better for some people.  Yeah.  He's charitable.  Yeah.  I mean, that's the smart thing those guys do.  Drug dealers that...  It's the smart move.  It is.  Yes.  El Chapo was always smarter.  But that's the thing you do is if you take care of the people in the area, they kind of look out for you and protect you, it seems.  Until we fix the broken system, to be honest, that's the whole point, is that people like this can, you know, how they get involved in it and why they get involved in it. 
[02:04:00]  Well, why do they get involved in it?  You know, you have a black market right now that's making this stuff beyond profitable for people.  And so when people can get their hands on it and they have no opportunity and no education and no way out and being able to kind of make something of themselves,  this gives a lot of people purpose and gives people, you know, something to do.  And it's, especially in their local communities, they're like local celebrities. 
[02:04:30]  And, you know, then...  Like Colin.  Yes, except they do less damage to the community.  Colin's just going to sip his Diet Coke and tell you, go fuck yourself.  Don't you go fuck yourself.  Oh, he's going to come back strong.  No, I'm not.  No.  Nobody comes back strong whenever he goes, oh, yeah, here we go.  I'm not saying, I'm not saying right, I'm not saying right now.  I'll get you guys back.  It will happen.  That's all I'm saying.  Pressure's on. 
[02:05:00]  So when I was growing up, we used to deal drugs, but it was different.  It was like everybody dealt to each other.  So nobody ever made money.  Like Pooh would deal to you.  Well, let's leave his name out of it.  But I'm saying what we would deal, it was called keeping your head.  So you had to have enough drugs for your head, so everybody dealt.  Oh, yeah, of course.  But nobody made that much money.  You just wanted to have fucking weed.  You just wanted to have your own weed so you'd all sell to each other.  So the profit, you know, there's no profit except for the fact that you had some weed. 
[02:05:30]  It was like a socialist weed dealing, drug dealing thing.  We interviewed Frank Lucas, and I would love to get...  Nicky Barnes I would love to interview.  I think he's out of jail, isn't he?  I think so.  Did you get him for the film or no?  We didn't.  I think he might have been in jail at the time.  Because he did that center spread for the New York Times, and fucking, you know, Jimmy  Carter saw it.  I don't know, this guy's got to go.  Whoa.  Because they were going to use his mugshot, and they told his lawyer, if he doesn't do  a photo shoot, we're going to run the story with his mugshot.  And they should have just let him use the mugshot, but I guess Nicky Barnes didn't want 
[02:06:00]  his mugshot in the New York Times Sunday edition.  Yeah, it seemed like he was bragging.  Yeah, and that's bad when the president looks at your picture and goes, this guy has to be  pulled off the streets.  Who else did you get besides Freeway Rick Ross to talk to you?  You know, we got one of the biggest international drug smugglers by the name of Brian O'Day,  who was fascinating.  He smuggled, I believe he made over $250 million.  Wow.  Yeah, he served over 10 years, and he's in the film, was really, really candid on kind 
[02:06:30]  of how he got involved in it, and how this was like his only way to, you know, make money  at the time he, you know, but was broke, and kind of turned to it in a kind of an innocent  way, and it blew up for him as a business guy.  That's the thing, is these guys, a lot of the guys are not your typical, you know, it's  not a black and white kind of thing.  It's like a lot of the guys are not who you would expect a lot of times.  Right.  And obviously, you know, you definitely have the guys that are, but...  What makes a guy go viral?  Because you've got a lot of these guys dealing, and then every once in a while you get one 
[02:07:00]  that goes viral and makes the 250 mil.  Right.  He's got the brains, man.  He's got the brains.  He had a really amazing kind of system set up, and people working for him, and how, you  know, he got things in, the way that they would smuggle it in through ponchos, and soaking  it into clothing, and you name it.  It is amazing, like, there's a great book called The Man Who Made It Snow about a guy  named Max Mermelstein, who was married to somebody fairly high up in the Medellin cartel. 
[02:07:30]  Like, he was one of the only Americans to get access to, like, Escobar, and who were  the brothers?  The Ocha brothers?  The guys that kind of...  The DS brothers.  Slam the keys down.  But that was really interesting on how they started flying the drugs in, and how they came  up with dropping the packages in the ocean, and how he thought he was going to be killed  when they lost a big ship, because the packages fucking burst when they hit the water, and  they had to go to Columbia, and they swayed my fucking millions of dollars worth of merchandise  just floating in the Atlantic Ocean.  Imagine his face when it exploded. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  His opening line to the Ocha brothers.  Funny story.  The title.  Gotta take pictures of that shit to prove that it broke, too.  Well, he said it was basically, they wanted to know what it was, and he had to say,  did he steal from us, or is this the cost of doing business?  And they came to the conclusion that...  Do you do the accents next time you do those characters?  Yeah.  Do you steal from us, or is this the cost of doing business?  Yeah, well, they would play with just older Jewish men.  Is this the cost of doing business? 
[02:08:30]  So, uh...  Yeah, I mean, if the laws weren't the way they were, the way that they are, and they  weren't set up the way that they are right now, people wouldn't have the incentive to  be, you know, getting into this industry and the drug trade the way that it is right  now.  And I think that's the biggest thing, is us as people just really looking at, you know,  where we are as a country and taking our rights back.  I mean, this is something that I think a lot of people are just like, eh, it's a failed  war, and we all know this.  But, I mean, we spent a trillion dollars.  Imagine if we spent that trillion on, you know, productive solutions or things that 
[02:09:00]  actually, you know, helped people or anything else.  Do you think they should just legalize it?  But what about, do you think it's affecting, I always want to know, do you think it's affecting  these cartels right now, all the legal pot?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's costing them a lot of money, right?  Absolutely.  I mean, what happens is we're built, you know, we're, these cartels are making more and more  money the more, you know, the harsher our drug laws are.  I mean, that's just fact.  And do you think all the legal pot, like, they probably hate that?  Absolutely.  They can't stand it.  But I don't think it's just, you know, a black and white thing, like, just legalize  everything and people walking around.  I mean, otherwise, you know. 
[02:09:30]  Everyone's a junkie.  I think, in all honesty, though, there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of things  out there that people do out of desperation and out of necessity.  And I think that, you know, if we look at things and don't judge them so harshly as a  black-white issue and start, you know, saying what we can do and taking things on an individual  basis, you know, I think we'd be a lot better off.  I'm annoyed I didn't see this because I've heard about it and there is, like, I hate to  say this or buzz about it, but, I mean, people are talking about it.  Absolutely.  It premieres, it opens when, and Mike Tyson is, what, the exec producer on it? 
[02:10:00]  No, no, that's a different film I'm doing.  Oh, boy.  Okay, that's Champs.  I was going to ask you about Mike Tyson.  You guys really are good friends?  Yeah, Mike's a good buddy.  We've had him on.  I love Mike.  He's become a regular.  We love the guy.  Mike's the man.  Now that he's opening up and just not that serious Mike Tyson that we saw for most of  those years, he's great.  He's a lot of fun to hang out with.  He's a character.  You were a groomsman at his wedding?  I was in the wedding.  We had an amazing, he had kind of a secret wedding.  He had a birthday party. 
[02:10:30]  He and his wife, actually, Mike's birthday is this Sunday, and he and his wife, his wife's  birthday is about a week ago, and at the time, they'd been together like three years.  I think they were actually legally married but never had a formal ceremony, so they were  doing a joint birthday and surprised all the guests and made this, like, it was a very  small, intimate wedding, but it was awesome, and Mike's hilarious, and as you know, really  witty, quick.  Really quick.  He's very silly.  That was my favorite part of his show, is to see him behaving silly is fun to watch. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, the one-man show, I'm sure you've seen, and now HBO picked it up.  HBO's still, yeah.  Which is great, because it was amazing.  Yeah, he's been through everything.  I mean, that's the thing about Mike, is he's legitimately been through everything.  It's the good, bad, the ugly, he's there, and I think now he's kind of had a moment  to take a step out and reflect, and I think that's what makes that.  And you're a big boxing fan, you made Champs, which is, look at celebrities that love boxing.  It's actually, it's not even a boxing film, and it's not even made for, you know, celebrity 
[02:11:30]  or, you know, boxing junkies.  It's really about the mindset and heart of a champion, and it's about, for anybody that  is out there that has been through anything that, you know, insurmountable obstacles and  feels like, you know, they've had the toughest time or a bad shake on stuff, it's the type  of film where, you know, hopefully we're trying to make it like the Rocky documentaries where  you really are, it's a lot bigger.  You know, boxing is kind of used as the vehicle.  Okay.  Well, it's called Champs.  Yeah, this is, I mean, it's like a, it's almost like a small independent film cast. 
[02:12:00]  It's got Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Wahlberg, DeMiro, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Jeremy  Piven, Tyson, Sugar Ray Leonard, De La Hoya, Manny Pacquiao, and Bernard Hopkins.  But those are like well-known people, Jimmy.  No, no, I was just, I was just kidding.  I was giving the opposite.  Oh, see, I thought.  No, literal Anthony.  Oh.  See what we did there?  We had Sugar Ray Leonard on, too.  We almost got him crying.  He almost cried. 
[02:12:30]  I think we backed off at the last second.  Oh.  We didn't want to be here as he's crying, I think.  I wanted that.  I think we all felt kind of awkward.  We were talking about his abuse, and he, you know, you read his book, he talked about  being abused a little bit, and he kind of.  He shares it in our film.  Oh, he does?  Oh, he does.  Okay.  Does he cry for your film?  You know, he's a, he's a great, he's a great public speaker.  I mean, he's known as, you know, that's what he does.  That's what he does.  But, uh.  We loved him.  Yeah, he's, he's an inspiring, amazing guy.  He was terrific.  Well, we were talking to him, he was talking about that, and he looked like he was ready 
[02:13:00]  to cry.  So it was, you know, a nice pause, and a pregnant pause, and kind of a nice moment.  But there are some people who are uncomfortable with emotion, and just kind of went, ah, it's  okay, Ray, it's okay, Ray.  You know, some people.  I don't like when people kind of get that emotional shit going.  He was good, though.  I got to cut that right off in the bud.  I'm sure you love that.  Yeah, I probably was like, no.  No, I don't like that.  Tits, tits, tits, tits.  Titsy, titsy.  Bring in the tits, please.  Let's change this subject.  Titsy, tits. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  Fucking monster.  That was the best.  What happened?  I'm just showing him my favorite, Golovkin.  Oh.  He's a killer.  Is he a boxer?  Yeah.  I don't know who he is.  In Kazakhstan?  Is that what he's from?  Yeah.  Well, tell us more about him.  He's deadly.  Is he heavyweight, lightweight?  What's his record?  No, I was just having a moment with Bert trying to show him, hey, I got the inside dope on  the box.  It was a nice moment, but you talked it into a microphone, and we have ears, so I would  like to know more about this guy.  No.  All right.  Maybe Bert can tell you about him.  Bert, what's cool?  Comment?  He's an amazing guy, and loves long walks on the beach, actually. 
[02:14:00]  The guys in our film, you know, what's interesting is it's not, you know, a lot of guys look at  boxing, and it's kind of, you know, it's a dying sport, and, you know, I think a lot  of people have an appreciation of where it's from and what it stood for back in the day,  and then obviously it's been corrupted a lot over the years, and this film's really,  you know, the things that these guys have gone through in life and how we all do is really  what struck with me, because to be honest, I wasn't the biggest boxing fan before I started  this project.  I like boxing.  I'm a sports fanatic, but really it was about these guys' stories were so relatable to anybody 
[02:14:30]  from anywhere in life, which was beyond fascinating.  I mean, even someone like Mary J. Blige, you know, who's in the film, she, you know, Mary,  I know, you know, outside socially, and she was just like, wow, like, what project are you  working on?  Once we talked about it, she got really into it and was like, you know what, I resonate with  fighters and the things I've been through, you know, I don't know if you guys know her  story, but just from the drug abuse, and was homeless at one point, and was abused as a 
[02:15:00]  child, and she really related to these fighters at a young age, even though she's not a huge  boxing person.  She was homeless before she became famous?  She was, yeah, at one point in her life.  So she's, I mean, it's a perfect example of someone who's just like been through the  ringer and looks at someone like Mike, and these guys is very, very relatable, and it's  kind of, you know, as an audience member, you're like, wow, I'm not that different than  these guys.  There's something for everybody.  You got famous friends, man.  With a name like Bert, you need all the help you can get.  For real, you got famous friends.  The drug movie is the first one that we all got to check out, and then we're going to 
[02:15:30]  check out Champs, what, later on this year, I think.  Yeah.  Make Money Selling Drugs opens Wednesday the 26th.  It's showing at the IFC Center here in New York, and then it expands out to LA, Seattle,  Portland, and Atlanta on Friday.  And you can also, if you don't live in these areas, and you don't want to fucking get on a  plane to watch a film, you can get it on demand.  This is the beauty of the internet.  It is available on demand Friday.  I like that on demand thing for some of these movies.  It's amazing.  It's fucking amazing.  It's about time.  It's on demand right now, actually. 
[02:16:00]  No, I know.  They used to only put the shitty movies on demand before, but now it's like legit films  they're finally putting up there for us to watch at home.  Thank you.  Oh, I didn't know.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know it was on demand.  Yeah, it's available on demand.  It's how you can actually reach the masses, finally.  It's the archaic old studio systems is gone.  They would only do it with the shitty films.  Yeah, go to iTunes.  They're not doing that anymore.  It's on iTunes.  I'm sorry, but it opened yesterday.  Why wouldn't it say opened yesterday?  It says opens Wednesday the 26th.  Someone's fired.  Yeah, let's hope so.  It's on demand Friday now. 
[02:16:30]  iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, and what is Vudu?  It's similar to those.  Vudu's great.  Got different kind of on demand films, new, great movies.  I had no idea this was available.  I would have watched it, because Roland's like, you gotta see it, you gotta see it.  And I'm like, where?  Yeah, it's the way you give it, it's available on to me.  Maybe he told me.  I just didn't understand it.  Did you try talking to Roland?  It's a fucking abomination.  He's gonna give me a cronut.  Yes, a cronut.  Oh, he's still talking about those hunks of shit.  He said, if I give him 120 bucks, he'll give me a cronut.  Yeah.  He's obsessed with the cronuts.  He's dealing cronuts. 
[02:17:00]  He is.  He's a cronut dealer.  He is.  Because the cronut guy is stupid.  He doesn't understand how to run a business.  He only makes, I think, 32 a day.  Yeah.  There's a huge demand, and he refuses to make more.  I feel like it's a sham.  Yeah, he assumes cronuts are gonna be really hot a year from now.  Fuck.  I feel like all these guys in line are hired by him.  I don't know.  I feel like this is a...  They line up at 5, 5.30 in the morning for a dumb cronut.  Maybe we need a new cronuf connection.  Why wouldn't you make just a shitload?  Get some Columbia cronufs. 
[02:17:30]  I understand the supply and demand thing to a point.  Yeah.  But Jesus.  Capitalize your shit.  Yeah, you idiot.  I hate that guy.  I hate him.  Yeah, we hate him.  I hope cronuts cause leukemia, and it comes out, and he's ruined.  He's a prick.  He's making us beg for cronuts, and then we did beg.  We were stupid enough to beg, and we're still not getting our cronuts.  How are they?  We don't know.  I heard they're very good.  To this day, we don't know.  I want to buy...  My goal is to buy two, and then take them out in front of everybody on the line, and  just step on them on the ground.  Not a very big goal at age 44, but it's something I want to do.  That's still not.  That would be nice. 
[02:18:00]  The destruction of the cronufs.  It's a two-minute documentary.  It's like what he did to Rich Voss' CD when he came out.  Oh, yeah.  I bought Voss' first CD.  He bought the first CD in front of all of us.  He goes, how much?  And Voss goes, I'll give her one.  He goes, no, no, I want to pay for it.  And he paid for it, and he just dropped it and smashed it.  We all had a lovely laugh.  It was one of my greater moments.  It's the most happiness that CD brought anybody fucking since.  I think I have my next documentary.  Just breaking shit and paying for it, and then breaking it.  It just feels good.  So, how to make money selling drugs. 
[02:18:30]  It's not really how to make money selling drugs, right?  It's kind of an anti-drug thing.  You know, to be honest, it really is a how-to guide.  We set it up, like I said, a video game, a how-to from the corner street dealer to running  a drug cartel.  And it literally shows you from every angle, from every side, people's different point  of views, and also how it's imminently fundable.  Like, it's just, it's endless.  The money is everything.  And that's kind of what this is, as opposed to just following one story or one specific  person.  Laundering? 
[02:19:00]  Any of it.  It's really just following the money.  It's kind of like The Wire.  I was just going to-  It's a lot like The Wire.  If you like The Wire, if you like Breaking Bad, it's really for-  This movie's for you.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Those are definitely inspirations for us.  What level do you have to start chopping people's heads off?  Like, what level?  Do you, in order to be one of those giant cartel guys, you gotta get your hands dirty there.  You gotta start lopping heads off.  It's, it's, it's brutal, man.  Yeah.  I mean, like, in Mexico, I think over the last six years, 50,000 people have died.  It's crazy.  That's a great question. 
[02:19:30]  Where's the crossover from?  You're just dealing a little coke till you're dumping a body in the East River.  It's like, ah, I gotta start chopping heads off.  I can't believe I'm up to this point.  Where is that?  Where is that fucking line?  I'm leveling up.  Does anyone know?  Where's that line?  Where all the next thing you know, you're like, what the fuck?  I have to hack a body apart tonight?  But even in that world, the Mexicans are crazy.  Like, drug dealers shoot each other, but American drug dealers don't saw heads off.  Yeah, and leave them in resorts.  That's fucking frightening, man.  Yeah, heads off is almost like hack at this point.  They just get in their head, they put them on soccer balls and shit. 
[02:20:00]  Really?  Holy shit.  They do all kinds of evil shit.  It's like a black comedy type thing.  The worst video I've ever seen was a fucking, a guy hanging upside down naked, and there  was like six guys in fucking paramilitary gear standing around him with face masks on,  and the guy is struggling like a fish on a line, and they cut his cock off, and then he  just kind of goes like, you know, it's a horrible, and it didn't even bleed that much,  which was bizarre.  And then they slowly saw his head into a fucking bucket upside down, and they saw his head 
[02:20:30]  off.  And you watch the whole thing.  And you know what the sad thing is?  I don't believe that's the worst video you've ever seen, or been in, actually.  It's the worst one he's ever jerked off to.  He's about to eat sushi.  Jimmy can watch this stuff.  We can.  But it's unsettling, and it's terrible, but you know what?  How can you watch it, though?  I was talking to somebody who wants to go to Mexico.  It's a cautionary tale.  And I'm like, don't go.  Well, Mexico's all right.  And you can go to certain parts. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah?  It's a giant country.  Exactly.  It's like saying, don't come to the United States, because there's Detroit.  But it's different, because they can't.  No, it's much different, because the drugs...  I was in Mexico last year.  Exactly.  You shouldn't make a homecoming king.  The drug dealers, they don't care about the cops.  It's not like being here, because they don't behead police officers here and throw them  in the fucking town square.  Now who's being naive?  They run everything there, though.  That's the truth.  I mean, the cops don't have half the weapons they have.  They don't have half the power. 
[02:21:30]  The cops are completely outmanned.  And the Zedas are all cops.  They're actually cops.  Absolutely.  And if their guys are in jail, guess what?  They take a bunch of guns, a bunch of military guys, and bring a tank, literally, and walk  them in and walk them out.  And we have a video of that in the film.  Wow.  And that guy, Juarez, fucking killed all those people in the rehab.  He fucking broke into a rehab and murdered everybody trying to get clean from drugs in  the rehab.  Why?  Because he's a piece of shit.  Because it was bad for business.  Yeah.  Is that El Gaucho?  Who the hell were you talking about?  El Gaucho.  El Gaucho.  El Chapo? 
[02:22:00]  El Chapo.  No, you silly goes.  El Chapo.  Charlie Chapo is on right there.  Fuck, whatever.  Fucking double beheadings.  Decomia.  They don't know where El Chapo is.  He's in the mountains somewhere.  They'll probably never find him.  By the way, we have a new app that we're launching today.  We haven't actually even announced it, but I'll announce it here.  It's called Tug of War.  And literally, anybody who likes the movie or is passionate about this subject or just  wants to know how to get involved and actually, you know, because a lot of times you watch  a film like this, you're like, great.  Right.  Now, what the fuck do we do?  It's been 40 years, and there's just a documentary. 
[02:22:30]  We don't want it to end there.  The whole idea is to open up that conversation, not be scared to talk about things like this.  And, you know, you can get involved in organizations that are going to hopefully get to the government.  And we need to, like, force that change as opposed to just waiting on politicians to make  changes because that's just not in the cards.  That'll never happen.  Well, you can see it now on demand, iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, or on Vudu.  And if you happen to be here in New York, it's at the IFC Center in New York City playing 
[02:23:00]  now.  It then expands to L.A., Seattle, Portland, and Atlanta, if you'd rather see it in a  theater on Friday.  Yeah, in New York, we're doing a Q&A, too.  Me and the other producer on it, Adrian Grenier from Ontario.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So we'll be doing a Q&A after the film tonight.  So definitely come out and say what's up.  In Greenwich.  Okay.  Let's go.  In Greenwich.  I heard crickets, guys.  This is not a good sign.  Let's go.  Jimmy, just look at you.  I think it's 6th and it's 3-2-3. 
[02:23:30]  He messed me up because he said in Greenwich, and I'm thinking Connecticut.  No, no, 3-2-3, Greenwich.  Oh, okay, because he said in Greenwich.  On Greenwich.  I meant on.  It's early.  So he's trying to figure out how to drive to Greenwich, Connecticut.  I didn't know what he was talking about.  All right, at least he knows what happened there.  Yeah, it's right on 6th Avenue.  Oh, okay.  We made it look like we had no desire to see your movie.  Yeah, 10 minutes from here.  Okay, I'm Biscayne.  I'm going to see this movie.  Don't get off Biscayne.  Bert Marcus, thank you so much.  How to make money selling drugs.  We really appreciate it.  I don't want to go.  A website or a Twitter?  Yeah, check out the website. 
[02:24:00]  It's on TribecaFilm.com, and you can look us up on Facebook, too.  And definitely check out the new app, Tug of War.  And come back when you're promoting Champs later this year.  Yeah, I'll bring Mike.  Right?  Yeah, we love Mike.  He comes in.  He's very fun.  That's great.  All right, cool.  We've got to take a quick break, and then we've got tits next.  Thanks, fellas.  We go from you to tits.  And Colin Quinn is here, and it's great.  Stay there.  After these messages, we'll be right back.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is back. 
[02:24:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show is back.  Go on, sit down.  The celebrities are ready to entertain you some more.  Colin Quinn.  Colin Quinn is a big star.  Are we on?  Are we on?  Yeah.  As much as we make fun of Colin Quinn, he's a big star for real.  A big star.  As we all know, and he's got this new one-man show, Unconstitutional.  It's going to be at the Cherry Lane Theater July 4th through the 23rd. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, yeah.  Just, it's an amazing one-man show.  We all have seen it, and we love it.  And he's got a lot of press to do tomorrow for Unconstitutional.  He's trying to rearrange his entire fucking schedule because Marion and Lady Di are making  their big return to the show tomorrow.  You've got to come.  I've got to come.  No, he knows that.  We just discussed it for like seven minutes, and he's trying to figure out his schedule.  He's like, he might cancel some really important interviews just to be here tomorrow.  The day I fell in love with this show and you guys was the day when the Video Music Awards 
[02:25:30]  was the most prestigious event, and you guys took them.  Right before 9-11 for people.  Okay, it was right before 9-11.  And you guys took them as your dates to the Video Music Awards, an event that people were  clamoring to bring in the hottest.  And you guys brought those.  I said, this is the funniest thing ever.  We were in the middle of contract negotiations.  And of course, the radio company also owned the VMAs, MTV.  And to really make us feel special, they gave us our own section on the red carpet.  Everyone else, like really big name fucking outlets, they were all squeezed in this other 
[02:26:00]  area.  But they're like, give Opie and Anthony some space.  We want to show them.  We really do appreciate them.  And it was me, Anthony, a producer, and these two.  Plenty of arm room as everyone else was squished together.  Horrendous.  And all the celebrities, and we were in the best spot, too.  They went through the corral.  And then we were the last stop before they went inside.  It was like prime real estate.  And they assumed we were going to take it seriously and have these legit interviews with  everybody.  And instead, we said no.  Me and Ant did the radio broadcast behind them as they were asking all the questions. 
[02:26:30]  Those pigs cost me a Mick Jagger photo.  I was just telling Kyle, he was the only one that was smart enough to know what the fuck  was going on and would not fall for our trap.  He started walking over to us.  He saw Lady DiMarion.  And he fucking bolted.  He shook my hand.  I said, hey, man.  He goes, hey.  And then they're like, I'm Mick.  Hey, Mick Jagger.  And he walked away.  I wanted to cut their heads off.  Do you understand?  Those two, their looks.  He hasn't had to look at girls like that since he was 15. 
[02:27:00]  To the first Stones, to the first concert they did.  And we were going back over, and it was a whole thing leading up to the VMAs where  they got their hair done.  Like, Marion was bragging how she got her hair done for the big event, and you couldn't  even tell she got her hair done.  And then they were talking about the dresses they bought from, like, Kmart or something.  You couldn't even tell there were new dresses.  Lady Di and Marion for the MTV Awards.  The greatest thing ever.  I remember the bosses fucking hated us for it.  They just didn't understand the humor in the whole thing. 
[02:27:30]  They were the worst.  They were so mad at us.  That was...  They went from, like, trying to take care of us to so mad that we would do that.  That was one of the best things ever.  How dare.  Well, but they're coming back tomorrow.  And with that, Colin has rearranged its whole schedule.  I know I do.  We haven't seen...  I haven't seen Lady Di in years.  We're going to try to get them in by 7, 7.30 tomorrow.  It's historical, yeah.  We'll do the first hour like we do, and then move into them.  Huh?  Yeah, it's historical.  And you were the one that put them over the top.  It was a historical event.  Because you...  Not that you're obsessed about, but you really... 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  You hammered it home how great that was to us.  I'm like, oh, okay.  Maybe we do have something here.  It was so brutal, but it was great.  It was the epitome of brutality of real life.  Just like, ugh.  Yeah.  We got Rachel Jantel back on the stand in the Georgia...  What's he saying?  St. Mount Martin, in case.  And I think people owe me an apology, right?  She's admitting that she can't read.  At least cursive writing.  She's saying...  Oh, wow.  They asked her, can you read typed written words? 
[02:28:30]  And she kind of looked around.  She went like, eh.  She can't read.  I don't think she can read.  I tweeted that last night.  What a great education here in the United States.  Yeah, just pass her right along.  My tweet was an observation, and I got a lot of shit for it.  I said, I would like to know what she's thinking about on that stand as she makes believe she  can read.  It was so obvious to me she couldn't read what was in front of her.  Yeah.  And now she's admitting it.  Why don't we just pot it up for a minute?  Yeah, pot that up. 
[02:29:00]  ...of the case, if you will.  There we go.  Yes.  And those facts included you saying that Mr. Zimmerman said, what are you doing around  here?  Yes.  She's always on my mind today.  She looks pretty.  You do acknowledge, though, the first time that you were asked that question in your interview  with Mr. Crump later that day, your response was that Mr. Zimmerman said, what are you talking  about? 
[02:29:30]  Yes.  Now, the saddest was the poor father yesterday.  Oh, with Trayvon Martin's father just shaking his head like, no, no.  He fucking planted his head right in his hands.  He knows.  And that was it.  He knows this isn't working out well.  Coming through here.  Once a witness starts cross-examination, once they start cross-examining a witness, the  state cannot prep them anymore.  Oh, okay.  If they do, what they discussed is fair game for the defense. 
[02:30:00]  So, she's on her own again.  Look at that.  Look what the news is saying, CNN.  She says she heard Zimmerman say, what are you doing around here?  But they're not saying the correction that she originally said he says something else.  Yeah.  Right.  They are fucking lying.  Yeah.  Her deposition and what she's saying now really conflict with each other.  We've got Bill Burr calling from Hollywood.  Hello, Mr. Burr. 
[02:30:30]  Hello.  Hey, Bill.  We've got Colin Quinn in today, and we're discussing Rachel Jantel, who's on the witness  stand again today.  Star witness.  Star witness that everyone really, really enjoyed yesterday.  Yeah, she's a lot of fun.  Guys, I haven't been keeping up on this.  I wasn't really keeping up on this case until she appeared.  She is amazing.  She's a treat, man.  She's got Twitter abuzz.  Yeah.  She will absolutely make you miss Patrice O'Neal, though, when you see her.  Yeah.  She looks exactly like fuck. 
[02:31:00]  I've never wanted him to be here so badly in my life.  So you can just point and laugh.  Yeah, she kind of looks like Patrice in drag.  All right.  Well, I'll have to check that out.  Dude, Bill, she looks so much like him.  Like, when you look below her hair, like just above the eyes, the shape of the face, the  fucking expression on her face.  It's like literally Patrice in a way I could not get over.  He would love it.  He would love seeing this happen because he would see the case falling apart. 
[02:31:30]  And another day where we miss him because the shit he would have on this would be just  so over the top good.  Oh, my God.  Right?  Yeah.  You know, when all that Paula Deen stuff came out that made me miss Patrice, I would have  loved it.  Yeah, he'd have been all over that, too.  Yeah.  And he would have taken her side in a way and known that she was a...  He might have said she was a racist or she's awful, but he would have fucking killed everybody  for being shocked about it.  Right.  Yes.  And dishonest about it.  And he also would have appreciated the fact that she actually admitted... 
[02:32:00]  She didn't have to.  Yeah.  And obviously she should have lied about it in hindsight.  She was a little too honest.  I used to sing it at birthday parties.  Stupid her thinking that, you know, something she said 30 years ago shouldn't matter right  now.  Yeah.  But it does in this new society we live in.  Amazing.  I don't like that Bill's doing...  When you have a slavery-themed wedding, I mean...  Yeah.  That's a little rough.  That was a little rough.  I know how you guys are going to try to find the benefit of the doubt there, but I mean... 
[02:32:30]  No, no, no.  We found the humor in it.  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  I'd love to go to that wedding.  Hey, Bill, a bunch of people around here have seen The Heat, and they're saying that  you're good in it, man.  Congratulations.  Oh, thank God.  Thank God.  Don't blink.  You're going to miss me.  I have my usual role, like eight lines, and I'm out.  I was talking to someone about that.  They said you're in this movie more.  More than that. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, they're being very nice.  Jesus.  It's still nice.  It's still good to get along.  Go see it, and I don't know, hopefully it makes a bunch of money, and they'll do another  one.  Bill's the...  Oh, he's the...  Over-the-top loudmouth Irish bad guy or cop.  I play a red-headed angry douche from Boston.  It was a big stretch for me.  I love it, man. 
[02:33:30]  It's so fun to see you in those movies.  When you were with Walken and Pacino, I'm just like, this is fucking hilarious.  Look at him.  That's great.  Look at him.  Our little Bill.  I don't find it hilarious.  No?  It makes me physically ill to see Bill starring with fucking A-listers just doing scenes with  A...  You did a scene with Pacino, man.  That's fucking amazing.  That's great.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's great.  Like I said, eight lines.  I'm the king of it.  If you need eight lines in a movie, I'm your guy. 
[02:34:00]  And then, I guess you were on Conan last night?  Yes, I was.  I went out and did panel for the...  To hype this movie, The Heat.  Jesus, I'm the worst.  It was about an unscrewed...  Bill, Jesus.  ...I was on show, movie.  This is exciting, man.  Yeah, we're happy for you, man.  Yeah, Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy, I think, is hilarious.  Oh, she was here the other day.  I wish we would have gone.  Why wouldn't she come on our show?  I don't know. 
[02:34:30]  She probably came in at like three.  Oh, probably.  She's coming late.  Yeah.  Who's here today?  Miley Cyrus?  Yep.  Is she here yet?  She texted me.  So, I hear that...  I'm going to acknowledge that.  That she's not taking pictures, though.  I don't care.  I already got one with her.  Yeah, but this is the new fucking hot...  With the little hot pants and short hair.  All right.  I got it.  When she looks 15, I win.  Is the movie out tonight, Bill, or Friday?  It comes out on Friday. 
[02:35:00]  It comes out on Friday.  Tomorrow.  A bunch of people will go see it.  I think it's going to do very well, man.  I'm sure they will.  Yeah, absolutely.  Do you got a back end on this?  No, I got the...  You're lucky to be here money.  I love it.  Hey, Hernandez got arrested for murder, huh?  Yeah.  I was going to ask you about that.  Dude, that...  It's just...  You know what's funny is how much people are into sports up in Boston.  I'm talking to my friends. 
[02:35:30]  I'm literally like beside myself.  If someone could throw their life away like that, my buddy's like...  I'm like, dude, he goes, Gronk's getting injured all the time.  Now we lose Hernandez.  Who's Brady going to throw to?  He's going to give a shit.  You know, it kind of transcends the stupid game.  Right.  It's like, how are we going to beat the Dawson?  Wow.  That guy, man, that was all premeditated.  I mean, this wasn't like a spur-of-the-moment thing. 
[02:36:00]  Like, he killed someone and then realized, oh, my God, I think I just threw my career away.  It's like, hey, let me just...  He knew.  ...plan out a murder.  He had time.  Yeah.  He wasn't...  It didn't seem like he was on drugs.  It was just a full-blooded execution style.  I mean, all alleged, of course, but like...  Oh, well, of course.  I don't think that his teammates got to be, like, beyond freaked out or weirded out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People snap and they fucking, I don't know, they kill somebody in, like, a crime of passion, 
[02:36:30]  but, like, he just, he did it like, I don't know, like a fucking hitman.  Planned out.  And he just throws away $40 million.  He was going to get $8 million a year for five years.  And then, and also an eight-month-old.  He's an eight-month-old.  There's something else there.  There's somebody had sex with the wrong person.  There's something else there, man.  Yeah, definitely.  I'm waiting for the cell phone calls for those tapes to come out when he calls the cleaning company.  I can't wait. 
[02:37:00]  It's going to be...  Dude, how quick can you get here?  You got one of those real good carpet cleaners and, yeah, something...  Bring extra bleach.  It is.  People do snap, you know.  It's like one of the most original, funniest comics around, most prolific comics saying,  don't blink or you're going to miss me.  You know, Colin...  You have to sit back for four minutes before you chimed in with your fucking cunty comments. 
[02:37:30]  I just love that you had to sit on it and slowly die.  Exactly.  Oh, shit.  Listen, Colin, it's no one-man show, okay?  Look, I said you're one of the most brilliant, prolific comics, but I have to admit, I never...  I never heard anything more breathtaking than, don't blink, you're going to miss me, guys.  You should have done that on a panel at Conan last night.  He would have tore the house down.  You think that kind of downplays his normal, you know, personality and act and everything 
[02:38:00]  to be like, you know...  What, to be like anyone's uncle from, like, 1985?  No.  I think it's a witty comment because it means it's a small part.  Right.  Holy shit.  Jesus.  You guys are rough.  I told you, I tried to give myself a real part in that movie, but I didn't appreciate it.  I rewrote the whole script for them. 
[02:38:30]  He rewrote the script for Crocodile Dundee.  Did you know that, Bill, when I was in Crocodile Dundee?  I had one line, and I rewrote the whole script with a new guy leading Paul Hogan around New  York, me, and handed it in.  That's a better fucking movie story than whoever was on the set of Brandon Lee's last film.  It's so fucking funny.  What a set of balls on the young Colin Quinn.  What a delusional ass I was.  Well, you know what? 
[02:39:00]  What?  I gotta tell you, for the first five minutes, you guys were so nice to me, I really felt  like you were setting me up for something.  No, no, no.  Man, we're happy for you.  For real.  I love it.  Drag me back in.  Drag me back in.  No.  I'm sorry, my son.  See what this show has done to everybody?  It's so jaded.  Fuck.  You're the one that pointed out that, you know, you feel you would leave this studio and  it's a nice, bright, sunny day, and you're like, what the fuck did I just do? 
[02:39:30]  I love that observation.  You kind of got away from that, though.  We're trying.  Yeah.  When I first came, was coming in there, there was that naked girl crawling around on the  mousetraps with the, like, food stamps.  Oh, yeah.  Patty.  There was the guy with the mental problems, and we all walked off the show and left him  in there.  We tried to re-trigger whatever his problem was.  Holy fuck.  I forgot about that guy.  He thought he was seeing.  And then we, he thought he was, he would see people, and then, of course, we have to  be idiots and sneak back in the studio and, like, pop our heads up and stuff to really 
[02:40:00]  freak him out.  Yeah.  We used to yell at the working man down on the sidewalk.  Ah, right.  Remember that day we were screaming at that janitor like his life didn't suck enough?  That's true.  How much hate mail I got on MySpace?  That's how long ago it was.  Yeah, that was the good old days.  Are you kidding me?  Ah, shit.  I forgot about that.  We would put porn on the sidewalk and see who would pick it up. 
[02:40:30]  I love that bit to this day.  That was a great one.  We'd just have dildos on the sidewalk and just wait for someone to pick it up, and then  we'd ridicule them.  Fox.  Didn't we have bullhorns, and we'd start yelling at them?  We'd yell at them with bullhorns.  Ah, you fucking pervert.  We'd come in, and they'd bring Opie gifts, and he'd act like he'd like them.  We'd just smash them right in front of them.  They were shitty gifts.  The poker chips.  I forgot about those.  I haven't forgotten about the poker chips, because I think you got a really nice gift, 
[02:41:00]  and then it was like, oh yeah, there's two of them, three of them.  I think I got crappy ones.  Actually, yeah, Jimmy was filming Lucky Louie back then.  Oh, that's right.  I was in the studio when that happened, though.  It's one of the biggest laughs I've ever had.  Oh, the poker chips?  Yeah.  One of my biggest laughs ever.  Yeah, that was fucking great.  But now Bill Burr is in Hollywood, and he's moving up.  The Heat comes out tomorrow.  Moving up.  Sandra Bullock.  It's impressive, dude.  It's fucking, it's great that you're doing that.  Well, thank you.  I appreciate it.  And thank you, too, Colin. 
[02:41:30]  I know somewhere in your dark heart you're actually happy.  All right.  When are you coming back this way?  I don't know.  Maybe in July.  Okay.  Yeah, I see you got a lot of dates.  Go to billburr.com.  Yeah, Hyannis, the Cape Cod Melody tent on the 12th.  Hey, Anthony, you'd like this?  I'm doing a whole tour of the Red States.  Oh, are you?  Yeah, I'm going to go see all your people out there.  My people? 
[02:42:00]  Oh, good.  I'm racing out there to buy Paula Deen cookbooks.  Oh, I thought you meant honest, law-abiding citizens of America, my people.  You know, not fucking spouting out gibberish like fucking the Today Show and walking on  eggshells around fucking people because of certain words.  Anthony, you sound worse than me trying to promote this movie.  I know.  You've got to get a little more flow to it.  I know. 
[02:42:30]  I was watching the trial here.  It's very difficult.  I'm very distracted by this fucking trial.  Yeah.  And we have girls.  Oh, there's girls?  What do you want on this one, Anthony?  I don't know.  You know, I'm on justice's side, okay?  How about we just hope justice prevails in this case, Mr. Burr?  Yeah. 
[02:43:00]  Hey, did you hear?  Trayvon called him a creepy ass cracker.  And I bet, you know what?  I bet you believe everything from that side.  And for some reason, I have a feeling you're questioning everything from the other side.  That is from the prosecution's witness, sir.  Six, blindly loyal sports fan.  Sir, that is from the prosecution's star witness, the girl that was on the phone with Trayvon  right before he was uh he said that by all means blow his brains up that fucking guy is such a  wannabe cop i'm like is that illegal i didn't know is it a wannabe cops uh that's illegal you

Fantastic.  And then?  And then?  If this was the testimony that was going on with this beast in the fucking Zimmerman trial,  I'd be going, well, you gotta convict them.  You gotta convict them.  This girl's a genius.  She knows everything about everything.  That was, yeah.  CNN, they're blocking out the word ass.  They're putting documents.

The O.P. and Anthony Show is available later today with Sirius XM On Demand.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  Finally, the moment is at hand.  After O.P. and Anthony Live is coming up next.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:18:00]  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  This is After O.N.A. Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Welcome to After O.P. and Anthony Live.  Colin Quinn is still here.  Nobody else is here.  What, do you want the radio?  Yeah, we're back.  Wow.  Wow.  Welcome to the show, Colin Quinn.  Thanks, Sam.  We were just talking about what an exciting day tomorrow is going to be. 
[03:18:30]  Yes, we are.  You had no idea that we'd gotten the updates from Lady Di?  I did not know that.  She called into this show first.  She called into the after show.  I guess she didn't know who I was.  She must have thought O.N.A.  I don't even know how she got this 866-WOW-1-WOW number.  Oh.  She's got her ways.  Huh?  Lady Di has her ways.  Yeah, she does.  She's a sneaky one, but nothing.  I know that you're a Lady Di fan from back in the day.  Yeah, Lady Di and Marion, yeah. 
[03:19:00]  Nothing's changed with this woman.  No.  It's been, I think, nine years.  No, five years since we've seen her.  And no job.  Still boozing.  Oh.  The only income that she has is, like, a while back her dad died.  So she's just been using some money that he left her to buy booze.  Oh, well, that's not nice, but, yeah.  She's got some guy to pay her rent for her.  It's really quite pathetic.  Who's the guy that should bring him in? 
[03:19:30]  We talked to him on the phone.  He doesn't seem like a jokey-jokey type guy.  No.  That's not how I'd describe him.  Kind of a surly...  A bit of a brute.  You know?  Yes, I can envision it.  But, so, yeah, it's going to be big tomorrow.  And you're rescheduling your shit?  Yes, I'm going to reschedule some of the press I'm doing because I have to be here for the...  It's kind of a historical event.  I think so.  I mean, it's the reunion.  You're not a Bobo guy because you're not...  You're like the old school. 
[03:20:00]  I like Bobo.  I mean, I appreciate all the people that torture him on Twitter.  You like that?  Yes.  You know, he...  They've gone in, like, a whole...  Like, the listeners of this show...  Yes.  ...have gone in a completely their own direction with it.  Right.  He's gone through, like, four or five different Twitter handles because people keep convincing  him that they're girls.  Yes.  And then he sends them his password and then they delete his account every time.  It's so cruel.  You know what?  It's one of those things.  Funny once, funnier five times. 
[03:20:30]  Right.  It's just like...  The first time you're like, oh, man, that's really mean.  By the fifth time you're like, come on.  He can't be doing it again.  They got him twice in one day.  That is good.  That is great.  And he calls the office and goes, I got a new Twitter handle.  I just wanted to let you guys know to follow me because I got a new Twitter handle.  Yeah.  People do.  People do seem to get a special joy. 
[03:21:00]  A sadistic joy in tormenting him.  It really is horrible.  I don't even know why we're laughing about it.  Because guess what?  As horrible as that is, just the idiocy of Norton, Opie, and Anthony going to try to  get Miley Ray Cyrus's picture with Miley Ray is really nauseating to me.  And it was amazing, too, because the girls are in here.  Right.  And we're like, okay, we're working on something with them.  And then Roland comes in.  It's like, oh, we're going to do like a bit with Roland, blah, blah, blah.  Everything gets put on the kibosh because we might be able to get a photo with Miley Cyrus.  The whole energy chain. 
[03:21:30]  Roland comes trundling in here and he starts going, blah, blah, blah.  And everyone's like, what's going on?  And even the girls are like, oh, is this the guy we're going to have a lap dance to?  They're going along good sports.  Sure.  And instead he goes, well, she's down the hall.  And even the girls, the 20-year-old strippers are going, what?  Are you guys turning down naked girls in front of you because Miley Ray Cyrus is here?  Are you 10-year-old girls?  Why do you care if you're not a 10-year-old girl?  It was the most surreal.  And I could see their faces confused.  Like, what is going on here?  Is this some kind of a weird, you know? 
[03:22:00]  But all the guys in the room, you know, gentlemen of a certain age at this point are going, yeah,  well, get back in the hallway then.  Let us know when Miley's ready.  You're going, what?  It's insane.  It's a funhouse mirror.  And then masculinity.  During the break down in the lobby, like half the show, E-Rock's down there, Roland's down there.  Everybody's got their cameras out trying to figure out how to strategize when a Miley Cyrus photo  can happen.  None of them can ever complain about the death of masculinity again because they're part  of the problem.  And as you pointed out correctly, E-Rock was down there pretending to take a picture, pretending 
[03:22:30]  to be the jaded board photographer.  He's in helpful mode.  Like, yeah, I mean, I got the camera, so if anybody needs me to take a photo.  He's like, I'm just a chronicler of what's going on, you know?  Yeah.  Like, I go down there and be like, E-Rock, Ant's not going to, Ant said forget about it.  So, and E-Rock's sitting there like, really?  Well, I don't know.  Well, we'll just wait and see.  We'll figure it out because he wants to be down there.  E-Rock practices his size, his jaded size at home. 
[03:23:00]  All right, I'll stay.  He's looking in the mirror trying to figure out, no, I see a little smile there.  I got to be emotionless.  My eyes are shining when I heard party in the USA, Miley's original eyes.  E-Rock, did you get your photo?  No, I didn't get a photo.  See?  See?  He was practicing.  No, I didn't get a photo.  What do I want?  I'm with you guys on this one.  No, I saw one, but I couldn't get one.  Why?  What happened?  Because it was only allotted for Aunt Jim.  Was she picky about who she was taking photos with?  Her management was.  But, oh.  It's incredible.  I was going to say it was her management, because do you honestly think she knows Aunt 
[03:23:30]  or Jim?  Of course not.  No.  She has no idea.  These are those creeps.  Yeah, whoever she was taking photos with, she was perfectly fine to do it, but it was  a matter of who got permission to actually go and get one.  How does her management know who to give permission to?  I guess Roland had set it up ahead of time for Aunt and then threw Jim in.  Yes, Roland breathlessly announced.  She looked great. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, I mean, that's why she is who she is.  She's a good looking girl, but, you know, I don't know.  So you're disgusted to find out that, like, Jim and Aunt were in advance.  Well, no, but just the scurrying about when Roland came in, when those two girls were sitting  really naked, and accommodating, everything spanked me, touched my teeth, you want us  to give a lap day, there was nothing in their attitude but, like, total accommodation,  funny, lively.  Right.  And that everybody, they just looked, they looked. 
[03:24:30]  If they had had five more minutes, they would have been disgusted and said, we're walking  out on you fruitcakes right now.  Two blonde Polish sisters in their 20s with giant natural breasts.  Yes.  And they showed up in the lobby while she was there with everybody.  They just walked right in.  Right.  And as soon as she got out, they have this little photo booth in the lobby there.  As soon as Miley got out, the two girls hopped right in and started taking photos.  See?  Troy's pissed.  You know Troy, don't you?  Yes.  Well, he was, yeah, he was correctly pissed, because he was trying to get Roland to take 
[03:25:00]  the lap dance.  Here's what happens.  Roland, Roland.  He had told you he was pissed.  Don't blame it on Roland.  I want the culture of this show to be at blame, but go on.  Roland will, like the penthouse came in, these girls are coming in, Roland's like, oh,  they're so hot, that's my shit, he loves blondes, blonde sisters.  Eastern Europeans?  Yes.  One smelled.  Go ahead.  One smelled a little bit?  A little bit.  Colin, you were sitting next to him, did they stay?  I have a bad sense of smell, I didn't smell, maybe it was the other one.  Shouldn't seem to smell, but I have a bad sense of smell. 
[03:25:30]  They could have shit as war paint on.  That's true.  And I would get a fucking lap dance from him.  You're right.  You're right.  A lap dance in front of the eight men here videotaping you.  Yeah, that's real sexy.  Listen, first of all, you're the perfect, you're the nightmare that they had to go through  in another generation to get through to this country.  I'm telling you.  It's one of the perks of the job.  Yeah, but the other perk is you have hosts who want pictures with other celebrities.  I'll say that.  The one thing I will say is that Roland did come in this room and said, look, do you want 
[03:26:00]  me to get a lap dance or do you want Miley Cyrus photos?  I'm correct, and every one of these idiots goes, whoa, Miley Cyrus.  We can't blame Roland for this.  The culture in this show is me of this.  If they said lap dance, I would sit down.  If Roland had gone and hidden, like in the beginning you came in and said, I don't know  where the fuck Roland is.  He's hiding.  And then it was like...  I saw him scurry off.  Okay.  I had to go talk to the management team.  But then Roland finally came in and goes, do you want me to do this lap dance or do  you want Miley Cyrus photos? 
[03:26:30]  And Colin's right.  Every guy in this room is going, well, you've got to get the Miley Cyrus photos.  Yes.  The whole thing.  And the girls were like this.  What kind of?  What did we step into?  Like they couldn't understand.  They'd been in five minutes.  They would have spit on everybody and walked out and said, I'm going to go marry a nice  real man from Warsaw.  And the problem is when you have a big celebrity and you're near them, you have to be part  of the talent department.  If not, they're not going to tell you to go away.  And not only that, but let's be honest.  If Roland had submitted to the supposedly favor of the lap dance, people would have been 
[03:27:00]  taking pictures of his crack of his head.  It would have been an occasion not to celebrate sexuality, but to try to humiliate Roland.  You're saying there was potential for something beyond flattery if Roland went through with  this lap dance, Colin.  I think so.  Oh, Jesus.  Colin.  I would hope not.  Roland knows that.  Pull his shirt up.  When the girls were coming in.  Hi, the girls have their shirts off.  Roland, take your shirt off.  Let's take his shirt off.  And these two Polish girls are taking Roland's shirt off.  He knows what's going on. 
[03:27:30]  He's got tears in his eyes, but he can't say no.  He can see the whole thing.  I told, I asked Roland, I said, would you do oil twister with them?  He's like, yeah, no problem.  I said, you'll do anything with these girls when they come in?  Absolutely no problem.  And then as soon as the girls come in, he runs off.  I understand he had to get the picture of the Miley Cyrus picture.  So they came up.  So it's when they won.  So Roland changes his tune once the girls are here.  Once they were here, did you still want to do oil twister with the girls?  Now, did we have oil or a twister board?  No.  Okay, so that would have been difficult. 
[03:28:00]  But did you still want to do oil twister with them?  Or did you start having second thoughts?  I didn't want to do it for the second.  Troy comes up.  Look at Troy.  He's all tied up.  He looks like one of those badass, black flag, early 90s California punk band guys.  Sure, sure, sure.  One of the original MMA type kids.  He comes up and wants to say, you want to do oil twister?  Troy's going to say yes.  Like one of the guys who is in MMA right before you could start making money doing it.  Exactly. 
[03:28:30]  And now he's watching these other guys become successful, but he still kind of has that MMA look.  Exactly.  You just don't know who he is.  He hung out.  He was like the tough guy that hung out with Sublime.  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And he's going to come here.  Why would Roland think you have his best interest at heart?  He wouldn't.  Do you sometimes question that, Roland, whether or not Troy's suggestions have your best interest at heart?  Yeah, I'm just hungry.  I'll do whatever.  But Roland's backed out of stuff we were supposed to do before.  We were supposed to go to strip club last weekend.  And he didn't want to.  He's like, I'm going, I'm going. 
[03:29:00]  And then all of a sudden, at the last minute, I get an excuse.  A couple months ago, we were supposed to go get jerked off at a massage.  Roland, you had such a great.  You didn't get jerked off at a massage parlor?  You did a depression.  No, I just like, I go, well, I'll get jerked off or I just pay my bills off.  I pay my bills off.  Paint your balls off?  Pay bills.  Pay my bills off.  Oh, I, how did you understand that, Roland?  I speak, I speak, I speak Rolando.  It's a dialect.  I could have sworn.  Out of Armenia, called Rolando, that his family actually speaks.  I could have sworn he said, pound his balls off. 
[03:29:30]  He could pound my balls off or pay my bills off.  Right.  So you chose to pay your bills instead of going to the massage parlor and getting a nice crank.  Yeah.  But he says, he'll be like, I'll be like, hey, you want to go get a massage and get jerked off this week?  And he'll be like, yeah, let's do it.  Let's do it.  We're going to do it.  And then at the last minute, it's like, all right, let's go.  Ready to go get jerked off?  And he's like, oh, it's an excuse.  You don't ever know what he's saying.  It's very vague.  His story changes each time. 
[03:30:00]  What is that, Roland?  I don't know.  You have second thoughts a lot?  You're more of a talker than a doer, maybe?  Oh, like, what's this channel?  Turn your head.  Jesus Christ.  He wants to please.  Troy's like the buddy.  We all do this and we never do it.  So yeah, whatever.  I think, yeah, I think he said, Troy is like the buddy.  He, you know, he wants to have it.  He wants to be that guy.  And then at the last minute, he's like, it's not going to work.  He goes into a depression and just says, I'm going to go home.  Troy's like the kid in high school that's like, no, we're going to rob this store.  And you're like, yeah, yeah, because you want to be cool. 
[03:30:30]  But then you get there and you're thinking about the cops and you're like, I can't rob.  So you get, you take the ass kicking instead of actually going and robbing the store.  But the one time we did went and got a massage and got jerked off, he comes out like a kid in a candy store.  He was so happy he got jerked off.  But then it's awkward that you walk in, the other dude's trying to look at you.  And you're like, oh, why am I going to fuck about shit?  I'm going to fucking see me.  I'm going to fucking walk in.  Yeah, Colin's walking around, everybody knows who he is. 
[03:31:00]  Give the fuck.  He's like, hey, my back is sore.  Yeah.  I'm going to get a massage.  He's not sitting there worried about a HuffPo article that says Colin Quinn cited in a Swedish massage parlor.  Yeah.  Were you just getting a massage?  Yeah.  I was just getting a massage.  It's a racquetball accident.  What are you going to do?  If that's your excuse, that's outrageous.  Even Colin is not on your side with that one. 
[03:31:30]  No, I can't side with you on that one.  How come you're backing out of massage parlor dates?  I don't know.  Now I'm starting to worry about the lap dance, too.  And the oil twister.  We're all a little worried about it.  We all look like there's oil.  And he goes, is the oil oil twister board drunk?  He goes, dude, he came to me.  He said he would do oil twister with the girls.  He's like, it's a good thing I didn't buy the oil twister.  What a waste of the money.  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:32:00]  They'll just film it.  Look at all the other interns.  They're great career things.  That's right here.  So then why would you agree to it before?  Why would you be like, oh, yeah, I'll do that?  It's in the office.  It's like the meetings.  We agree to everything the management says.  And then when it happens, it's like, yeah.  Is Colin right?  Are you going through a little bit of it?  Oh, wait a minute.  So you see Troy as management instead of just your friend.  Is that it?  That's a little strange.  No.  It's just like when people say stuff, you're like, all right, whatever.  Like, Troy's the type of guy, like, your friend, you could talk to, whatever.  You can speak to him confidentially.  Define him.  But, yeah, you don't appease your friend.  You appease management. 
[03:32:30]  You just say what they want to hear.  Do you do that a little bit with Troy?  Troy reaches out to you as a friend, and you treat him like management.  Where's that coming from?  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe middle management.  Is he your friend?  Or is he, you know what I mean?  You've got to stand and go, Troy, listen, I'm sorry.  I'm just in a depression.  I'm feeling a little insecure.  I don't want to go get jerked off.  I just can't do it today.  You've been there before, right?  Yeah.  I've never said, I've turned down such a great offer.  So you're telling me you'll pay for me to get jerked off? 
[03:33:00]  Oh, he didn't say he'd pay for them.  Are you paying for Ron?  I had to pay for it.  I had to say, dude, I will pay for you to go get jerked off.  How depressed can you be?  How depressed can you be?  Yeah.  All you have to do is show up and get an erection.  All you've got to do is wake up and know most people show up and get an erection.  Or, oh, maybe there's more to it.  Roland's closet is gay, and he doesn't want to have to deal with explaining to some, you  know.  Sue's like, listen, miss, don't tell my friend.  We'll say we had a good time here. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  I want Troy to think I'm cool.  Right.  Right.  But if you have a young Filipino boy in the premises, can you please slip him into this  room for 15 minutes?  Do you have a back door in this little massage room?  There's nothing wrong with that.  Just tell her to bring her nephew in or whoever.  Right.  Every massage parlor has like two Filipino boys that they have, like somewhere in the  back, just in case.  Oh.  Yeah, that's right.  Trust me.  That's interesting.  I'm an expert here.  All I'm saying is this, Roland.  You've got to just say, look, we all go through depressions, heavy depressions. 
[03:34:00]  You've got to wake up and go, all right, I'm going to depress, but I'm going to go  through with it anyway.  Who knows?  Something could have happened.  You guys might have had a couple of laughs.  Maybe that's the thing that's going to break you out of your depression.  Yeah.  It's not just the jerk.  It is.  It's the bonding.  It's the hanging out with your buddy.  That's the only way anybody gets through this miserable existence.  Right.  Right.  I mean, you see, and you see the way Colin and his buddies treat each other in here.  Oh, my God.  On a regular basis.  It's horrible.  If anything will drive you to a depression.  Yeah.  It's hanging out with the people that Colin Quinn calls buddies. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  Bob Kelly, his seventh fat.  Yeah.  Right.  His seventh what?  Fat.  Yes.  Seventh fat.  I mean, all the people that are showing concern for Bob Kelly now are the people that drove  him to become overweight.  And now he has a food show that he eats a lot.  Well.  Yeah.  It looks delicious, though.  Does it?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So you think it's a little bit of a depression?  Who knows?  It's this place.  Well.  They throw dicks in your ass and they suck the life out of you.  Maybe that's what it is.  You don't feel like getting jerked off after a dick was just in your ass, you know?  Yeah.  That's a good point, too. 
[03:35:00]  But getting jerked off always makes everything better.  That's true, too.  For you, Troy.  I mean, if anybody.  Yeah, but.  Any red-blooded American.  Roland doesn't have the confidence in his body that somebody like you does.  You know what I mean?  You're paying for a service.  Who gives a fuck what that girl thinks?  Maybe Roland does.  Roland's, you know, he's not used to women responding well to his body the way you are.  Is that right, Roland?  Sure.  A little bit of that, right?  That's a good point.  You know?  Like, when Troy takes off his towel, all the little weirdo Russian massage girls are probably 
[03:35:30]  like, oh my goodness, look at him, look at him.  Right.  Asian.  Whatever they are.  Whatever they are.  If you're into the table shower, he's like, hello, ladies.  Right.  For someone like me, or for someone like Roland, it's more of a horror show.  I go to the corner of the shower, I go to the corner of the shower, I go by myself.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, you gotta have the confidence just to take off your towel in front of these women.  Yes.  Maybe Roland's not packing a whole lot down in his pants.  Sorry, Troy.  Troy, you know, you never know.  Now everybody's used to Troy, he takes off his towel, all the girls are like, oh, guy  from Social Distortion, 1994.  Yeah. 
[03:36:00]  You know how they all love punk music from the mid to early 90s?  Oh, this guy's influenced by Henry Whelan.  But, you know, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe you need to be a little more sensitive with Roland.  Maybe you need to hold his hand a little bit more.  Maybe not so much tough love and more love love.  Yeah, but it doesn't sound like tough love.  It sounds like he's like, hey, let's go get jerked off.  And Roland's like, yeah, all right.  But why does he say yeah to it?  Why do you say yeah to it?  I don't know.  It's probably the job.  And you know, people, yeah, sure, yeah, yeah. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, he figures it's just small talk, just people pleasing.  It's just weird that, like, when then, but the people pleasing, like, I would say, if  somebody was like, do you want to get jerked off?  I'd be like, that sounds good.  Yeah.  You know, yes.  But then why does the no come when it comes time to actually go get jerked off?  You're a single guy.  I don't know.  You don't know?  I told you to depression.  But can't you just snap your, I mean, that's what you got to do, isn't it?  Well.  Snap yourself out of it, at least for the moment, and say, all I got to do is walk up to this 
[03:37:00]  massage parlor.  I'm paying this woman to jerk me off.  All I have to do is lie there.  If I don't perform well, that's her fault.  Well, maybe last time he went, maybe it wasn't fun for him.  Maybe he saw things that Troy, being just a, you know, superficial jock guy, couldn't  see, which is like, wow, this is a sad environment.  Troy said, like, hey, isn't it great?  We jerked off.  Right.  Like, he's back in the frat house. 
[03:37:30]  Roland actually takes a moment to see the humanity in what's going on around him, whereas  Troy is like, guys, we're all going to get jerked off.  Maybe a little of that is happening.  Is that what's going on, Roland?  Yeah, I think so.  I was like, hey, and you know what the funny part was?  I dipped into a purse and robbed her after she jerked me off.  Right.  High five.  Pound me out, bro.  It's dark.  It looks like Chernobyl.  They can't afford the bills.  Chernobyl.  Is it Chernobyl in that place, Troy, or are you just kind of so focused on the fact that 
[03:38:00]  you're about to get jerked off?  It's a sad place.  It's all rainbow.  No, it's utopia.  It is.  It is.  It's dark.  They play sad music.  No, they play nice, relaxing music.  And there's like three Asian girls sleeping, and the woman smacks them to go upstairs.  No, they don't.  They don't.  Colin, I think we're starting to hit on something here.  Yes.  No, they don't.  One girl's like, they're screaming at each other, and then the girl goes upstairs.  He's exaggerating.  They come out.  They're gorgeous little 19-year-old Asian girls.  He screamed at them.  And Roland probably looks at them like, what went wrong in your life that at 19 you're 
[03:38:30]  jerking off somebody like Roland?  No, I'll tell you exactly what it is.  He gets depressed when he walks in, and he smells like the half-cooked Chinese food that  they have to sit aside, then one guy passes by, he's like, you know, the head of the  triad, he collects half the money, he goes down to make money, they're like fucking indentured  servants.  Right.  They're paying off their passage from fucking, you know, Nanking and shit.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's a depression.  He's just looking at cold noodles and a little styrofoam tin that have been there for two 
[03:39:00]  hours because you just can't finish your meal.  They got to pay their bills, though.  No, I'm getting depressed.  Is that what it is?  You see a little of that humanity in there, Roland?  Yeah, you're like, okay, this is where my life is.  Troy, do you think you're...  He wants love, Troy.  Yeah, do you get that?  Roland wants love.  But he wants love?  Yeah.  I think this is where my life is.  For us, it's an excursion.  For him, he's like, this is it.  You see yourself more as like the Troy guy.  Like, you guys are the jocks.  Well, I would say...  Kind of like, we're just here to get our dicks off.  Normally, I wouldn't say I was like that except my picture when I was 19. 
[03:39:30]  Let me see that, by the way.  I haven't seen that.  I haven't seen my picture yet.  No.  It's really, it's a little troubling in some ways.  People can check that out on your Twitter.  Oh, and E-Rock just informed me it's been posted on the Opie and Anthony Facebook page, too.  That'll be perfect.  That's going to bring some positive responses.  So far, all kindness, correct?  No, but it's a very cruel thing, actually.  Is that right?  I hate to hear that.  Yeah.  Well, here's one of them.  Yeah, tell me, tell me. 
[03:40:00]  Why don't you just look right there on the...  No, this is my phone.  Well, this is one picture here.  Oh, you can see that's the close-up.  That's the close-up.  There's a young Colin Quinn.  He's got a...  I'm 19.  I look like I'm 40.  Yeah, it just looks like you if your hair grew out.  Like, geez, Colin hasn't shaved in a while.  Yeah, no, I'm definitely not...  I was not a very healthy person.  Let me go to Red Bear in Philadelphia.  What's up, Red Bear?  Yeah, I want to break down this whole Roland and Troy dynamic.  Yeah, please do. 
[03:40:30]  Roland is Elias and Troy is Barnes.  From Platoon.  Do you think that, Troy, maybe there is a difference in perspective here?  That maybe the fact that you're a well-manicured, styled, handsome gentleman, you know, good-looking guy in Manhattan, and Roland is just this kind of...  Models.  Models-wearing, weathered, large Mexican dude. 
[03:41:00]  Leaves you guys looking at the world at different...  Maybe you're a little not quite in touch with the way the rest of us see the world.  I'd understand that if we were going out to a bar and we were trying to pick up girls.  From your giant, good-looking, golden throne.  You don't see what it's like for all of us down on the floor.  Is that right, Roland?  You know.  I know.  I know.  I would understand if we're like, let's go out to a bar, let's try to get girls.  But if you're paying a girl, who gives a fuck what she thinks of you?  Just go get jerked off! 
[03:41:30]  You probably have to have that mentality going in.  Like, you have to have that mentality...  Because you don't give a fuck what girls think of you in general.  Because they're always like, oh, Troy, your hair looks so pretty today.  His quaff.  It's his quaff.  Whereas Roland is not used to kind of not giving a fuck.  Because he very much gives a fuck.  The minute a woman gives Roland any kind of positive attention, he's in love.  Because that's what happens.  No, they go, oh, at least she doesn't have some of your hair left.  Oh, thank you, you cunt.  Right.  I hope you have retarded kids.  All right.  Gee, Roland.  He's suddenly become the serial killer. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  He's got a lot of rage in him.  Yes, he does.  That's why I'm trying to let that rage out.  Through his dick.  Yes.  That's where the rage comes out.  Listen, I'm going to tell you something.  As I said before, we went to a massage parlor.  We got jerked off.  Roland was so excited when he got out of there.  We went, we picked out on barbecue.  See, that sounds like a good night.  Yeah.  He's a blast.  And he felt great.  He was giddy.  It's like, well, it was a good release for him. 
[03:42:30]  Do you find trouble, Roland?  Do you not remember how good the time was?  I mean.  I do.  Just when stress builds up here.  It's just different.  Isn't that, isn't that, what could be better than coming and eating barbecue to get rid of  that stress?  I think like a little dessert after that.  A little dessert.  Did you treat him to dessert?  He did.  We did.  Yeah.  He had dessert.  We had a great time.  That's why I know it's in him.  I know he wants to do it.  Because it happened the one time.  Yes.  And he enjoyed it.  It happened twice.  And the second time, that's when I had to pay for him.  You are hell bent on getting Roland jerked off. 
[03:43:00]  Because you know he needs it.  There is nothing that will stop you from completing this mission.  You know he needs it.  I mean, Roland strikes me as a guy that does need to get jerked off.  See what you call Bert.  This is our documentary.  Yeah.  Get him in here.  Do you not, Roland, why not accept a gift from Troy of a jerk off?  I don't know.  Now, I'm not saying Troy will jerk you off.  Actually, Chris in Brooklyn has a question.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, I was going to say, that's the problem. 
[03:43:30]  Troy asked Roland if he wanted to get jerked off.  And Roland said yes, because he thought Troy was going to do it.  Is that what it was?  Maybe that is.  Oh, do you think?  It may be that he's gay.  But if it's not, but either way, move it this way.  I hope that guy dies today.  Tragically.  Today.  Today.  I hope he gets kidnapped and murdered.  There you go, you asshole.  Well, maybe not today.  It's one of two things.  Either he wants to go, look, Troy, just jerk me off yourself, which is fine. 
[03:44:00]  You can ask him, Matt.  What's he going to say?  Or he's trying to say something else, which is more of a bro thing.  Because you know, Troy can be like his bro.  So it's like, hey, bro, we got jerked off.  We had barbecue.  You know what?  You're in great shape.  And then Troy's like, whoa.  He's like, not like that.  I'd like to be your fucking workout buddy.  Why don't you teach me how to work out and get in good shape?  Right.  Because what's better for getting out of a depression than working out like a beast?  We're only going to be one of these savages with those fucking smitties.  He needs a workout partner, Troy.  I've tried that.  Colin, Colin.  What? 
[03:44:30]  I've tried that.  Wow.  What's your problem, bro?  This guy's reaching out to you as a buddy, and you just keep rejecting him.  He just doesn't fucking like you.  Colin's speaking from experience, okay?  He went through some weird times when he was coming in on this show, and he was just talking  about being locked up in his apartment and writing down on scraps of paper and everything.  I've still got all that stuff here.  But you know what?  He lost a bunch of weight.  He got out of the depression.  He's got two one-man shows out of the deal.  Yeah.  Okay?  He's come out on the other side.  And we're all always going to be depressed a little bit.  The whole 90% of the world is in a depression most of the time. 
[03:45:00]  A little bit of depression.  But you've got to do things to get out of it.  Here, what's really weird is here's Troy offering the hand of friendship, and the problem  on it is Roland just doesn't like you, Troy.  Fucking back off.  He doesn't like your personality.  He fucking doesn't like you.  Deal with it.  Roland's just a polite guy that hasn't been like, Troy, I don't want to get jerked off with  you, I don't want to go to dinner with you, I don't want to see a show with you.  I don't want to work out with you.  I want nothing to do with you. 
[03:45:30]  We've gotten to know each other, and I don't like what I've learned.  Is that what it is?  That's what it is.  We've figured it out.  That's all it is.  He's like, you can pay for me to get jerked off, and I still say, go fuck yourself.  How about you take your money, you put it back in your wallet, and you go fuck yourself.  That's right, stick it up your ass. 
[03:46:00]  Roland.  Yes.  Maybe time for Troy to back off a little bit.  Back off, turd.  It's fine.  I like that.  We've gone from, okay, theory one.  Maybe Roland is in love with Troy.  No, that doesn't make sense.  Theory two, he hates him.  He can't stand his sight of him.  It's one of those two, that's for sure.  He's depressed.  He's sad.  No, he's happy.  What's wrong with him?  Yeah, he's disgusted by him.  All I'm saying is he invited you to work out.  You should have at least, even if you think he's a miserable cocksucker that he is, you  should have at least worked out with him a couple of times a week. 
[03:46:30]  I told him, I said, get a bike.  We'll go for bike rides.  Because it's fun.  It's a good way to lose weight.  You get to see the city.  Yes.  Or at least get one of those fun city bike passes.  He's like, oh, when I get my raise, I'll do it.  I'll get it.  Never happened.  When I get my tax refund check, I'll do it.  Never happened.  Oh, man.  Do you notice a pattern?  There's another pattern here, by the way.  Tell me.  Which I've noticed.  By the way, now we can rule out the gay theory.  Because if some muscular guy with tattoos goes, hey, let's go bike riding together.  If you're gay, you go, okay.  Maybe the guy does like me. 
[03:47:00]  But also, the pattern is.  You bought three bikes just in case.  He just said, when I get my raise, when I get my tax check.  And just now, what do you say?  I'd like to pay my bills.  Or play with my balls, whatever you say.  It's all money.  Roland's a cheap motherfucker.  Or else he's got some secret things he's spending his money on.  What do you spend it on?  Because it's always coming down to money.  That was the excuse.  Right.  He's a single guy.  It's not like he's paying for a family.  Yeah.  Living in Queens.  You know, in an SRO.  And I moved to Wall Street.  I live by there. 
[03:47:30]  I live on Murray Street.  He's not going to want to hang out with you.  He won't even hang out with you.  What kind of size place is down there?  I live right near you.  Where?  I live on Murray.  I live right on Rector.  Oh my God.  Holy shit.  We should hang out.  Yes.  Troy, would you be upset?  Would you be personally hurt?  Of course he would.  If Colin came in like tomorrow and goes, yeah.  Roland and me got handjobs.  Yeah.  We're going for bike rides.  Yeah.  We're going for bike rides.  Going to get a little dessert afterwards.  We're going to work out.  Imagine seeing us.  We send Troy pictures of us in Battery Park City on those fucking bikes riding down. 
[03:48:00]  Imagine the missing piece of the puzzle because two months later, Colin and Roland would say,  look, we're a couple and we want you guys to all be okay with that.  I'm telling you.  We started as friends, but we've fallen in love.  So neither of us saw it coming.  Just to turn down the idea of working out with Troy, it is bewildering.  A little bit.  Right.  But it is his fake money. 
[03:48:30]  He's always talking about the money in his mind.  It's the money thing.  And now his excuse is going to be, hey, when I lived in Queens, I could have done it.  But now I'm in Manhattan.  You're going to spend your whole life worrying about money.  When are you going to die?  And you go, wow, I could have had a good buddy, a workout partner, a jail partner.  I could have been working out.  That gets you out of depression, working out.  Right.  Nothing's better.  They proved better than antidepressants or therapy working out.  Yeah.  Roland.  I was depressed yesterday.  You know what I did?  Got on my bike.  And then when I came back, I wasn't depressed anymore.  This is ludicrous. 
[03:49:00]  Roland's sabotaging himself and sabotaging his potential friendships.  You're right.  Or love affairs.  We don't know.  Or love affairs.  We don't know 100% yet.  He's a shut down son of a bitch.  I think it has to do with his ethnicity.  You're Mexican?  Yeah.  But he's in denial of it.  He hates that he's Mexican.  Well, why don't you go to the Embrace of Mexicanism.  There's a Church Street Boxing right around the corner.  You go over there and start boxing.  Once you get into that groove, your Mexican heritage comes out.  You'll be moving around like one of those great fighters.  Like, what's his name?  Canelo.  Oh. 
[03:49:30]  Canelo.  Get in the game.  That's right.  Let me go to Clint in Alabama.  What's up, Clint?  Hey, man, the one thing y'all are missing here is that twice, Roland was able to control  himself when he was getting a handjob.  He's ready to take it to the next level.  He wants to kill one of these eggs.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Oh, yeah.  Before Roland, when Roland is just all pent up, everything's fine.  He's just got all his anger pent up.  The minute you jerk him off, he's going to start slaughtering bitches.  Well, yeah, the way you describe him, that may be a good theory there. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  Is that what you're afraid to be around?  Do you see it's like a bull with a red flag?  Like, oh, no, I don't think so.  You don't think all of a sudden you just grab her by the skull?  He goes, oh, no, I don't think so.  If it was a no, you just say no.  I didn't hear the guys.  He said the problem is that you have all this rage that you'll get jerked off, and some  of the rage will come out, but it will just unleash Pandora's box, and you'll start  killing women.  I would kill women.  Who would you kill?  I don't know. 
[03:50:30]  Troy?  Troy, would you kill Troy?  Nah.  He was too far for me.  Where'd you go to high school?  Santa Monica.  Ah-ha!  I knew I was onto it.  Oh, you figured it out.  But what we said originally, all those bands from Orange County.  Oh, my God.  That's every guy you went to high school with.  Every guy.  All the popular guys were Troy.  And they were all making fun of Roland and his early mustache.  My Indiana Jones costume.  Yeah.  And his mustache that's way too thick for him to be that young.  See that?  Why is he having a problem with me? 
[03:51:00]  I'm here trying to help him out.  But he still remembers.  Your representation.  You and your dumb friends going to all those concerts and circle jerks and fucking social  disorders.  You guys were listening to...  Where'd you go, Troy?  Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Oh.  He's like a juggalo.  No.  Yeah.  Why is that to be Detroit?  No, no, no, no, no.  Because you know there are a lot of people in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  You tell me there aren't a lot of juggalos in Allentown?  There's juggalos everywhere.  They're everywhere.  Very popular.  Yeah.  You're telling me, though, that you couldn't see yourself as a representation of that guy 
[03:51:30]  who, like Colin said, was playing ooky cookie and listening to social distortion and just  hanging out with his bros but having contests over who could come the quickest and just  everything was a competition, none of which Roland could ever win.  Yeah.  But now I'm trying to reach out to him and help him out.  Yeah.  Do you see that, Roland?  Do you see that he's trying to be helpful now?  Yeah, yeah.  He's going to be helpful.  That maybe this guy that you hated in high school is now reaching out to you and saying,  Roland, I want to be your friend.  But see, here's the thing about Mexicans. 
[03:52:00]  They're very proud and very stubborn.  So right now, Roland, underneath this nice guy, is thinking, reach out to me.  You fucking reach out to me.  I'll reach out to you, motherfucker.  I'll fucking die before I fucking ever get jerked off with you again.  You know what I mean?  I do.  It's a machismo thing.  Yeah.  Ryan in Philly.  What's up, Ryan?  Quinn.  Yes?  You fucking dickbag.  I'm going through depression right now because of you. 
[03:52:30]  It's that picture he posted, isn't it?  Why?  So I grew up around the years of when you were on that famous television show, Remote Control,  do you recall?  Yeah, sure I do.  And what the fuck would you do when you were on it all the goddamn time?  Smoke.  Yes.  Well, I'm addicted to fucking cigarettes.  I'm trying to quit right now, and I can't do it.  And I was influenced by you.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You always hear that, like, if you smoke on TV, you know, I've heard it from so many 
[03:53:00]  people.  I know you're telling the truth.  Getting confronted that you looked cool smoking those cigarettes.  But look, I quit myself 21 years ago, and I'm telling you, it's a new bright world out  there, young fella.  It can really work out.  Just, you know, good luck.  Yeah, well, you're a fucking millionaire.  You can buy to fix it.  You're filthy rich, but you looked incredibly cool doing it.  I went to school.  Not only was I not cool in school, but I'm addicted to cigarettes.  I'm going to die of cancer. 
[03:53:30]  Apologize to Ryan.  Ryan, I am very sorry.  Thank you.  I'm very sorry, Ryan.  There's nothing I can do about it, but I'm very sorry.  Well, look, they could do is see how cool you look now, not smoking at the one-man show.  Yeah, but I looked so much cooler then.  Is that right?  You see my picture on Twitter, Ryan?  I am confident on Twitter.  You can go with it.  I was smoking three packs a day back then.  What do they have to Google to find your one-man show? 
[03:54:00]  I feel horrible, but it is true.  A lot of kids used to come up to me and go, hey, man, you're the reason I started smoking.  Makes you question a lot of things.  What do they Google to find your one-man show?  Fucking keep my name on constitution.  Whatever.  I love how people always have to put links.  Google.  I thought, Google, we don't need links anymore.  Just Google.  Google Colin Quinn.  Unconstitutional.  Unconstitutional.  You'll see his one-man show.  You can also hear him on.  He'll be back tomorrow.  Yes.  For the return of Lady DiMarion. 
[03:54:30]  And Bobo.  And Bobo.  Troy Rowland, I feel like we've come a long way with you guys today.  I feel like we got to the bottom of it.  Wow, we should do this all the time.  Yeah.  We haven't got to the, well, are you kidding me, Sam?  We've scratched the surface of the depth of Rowland.  Rowland's like Mexico itself.  You know what I mean?  It's got this amazing, complex history.  And there's a lot of drama.  There's a lot of bloodshed.  A lot of sorrow.  And a lot of beauty.  Colin and I are pitching a show to SiriusXM where we bring people on.  We analyze the relationships.  Yes.  It's going to be like, it's relationship therapy.  Yeah. 
[03:55:00]  With Colin and Sam.  And sometimes it's a bromance.  That's right.  I like this idea.  It's friendships.  It's romances.  It's everything.  Well, thanks for hanging out, Kyle.  Oh, what a blast.  This is better than the show itself.  Let's be honest.  Let's be honest.  It is at this point.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opey and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the ONA show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opey and Anthony.  And catch Opey and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Colin and Fez are next.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. </pre>
