<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with a montage highlighting their reputation as "shock jocks" and "controversial radio personalities."  The broadcast begins with Opie and Anthony discussing the damage inflicted on their studio by The Bravery after a previous night's performance. This leads to a discussion of Opie's newfound appreciation for Amy Winehouse's "To Know Him Is To Love Him,"  a song he heard on his girlfriend's alarm clock, which segues into a conversation about therapy following a past show segment with a therapist. Opie then attempts a disastrous "Grammy Minute," butchering Amy Winehouse's "Rehab" and "Big Girls Don't Cry."  The conversation then devolves into a lengthy discussion about Opie's excessively smelly and worn sweatpants, which he wore to the gym and to his fiancée's family's house,  with a caller, James, encouraging him to bring them to the studio.

The show then features a Steve C. remix segment, followed by a discussion of the writers' strike and its impact on late-night television.  They discuss an illegally uploaded version of *I Am Legend* on YouTube. Anthony's recently released 20-minute video podcast, detailing his paranoia about home invasions and his gun collection (a pilot for a future series), is then critiqued, with feedback from callers weighing in on both the podcast and Opie's sweatpants saga.  Opie recounts his struggle carrying a 10-foot Christmas tree home and his plan to escape his girlfriend's family during Christmas vacation by staying in a hotel, prompting a debate about the merits of this strategy. The show briefly covers top video games of 2007 and ends with a news story about hymen restoration surgery for Muslim brides.

A lengthy phone call with "George" from Colorado follows, focusing on George's perceived double standard in the hosts' criticism of Islam versus Catholicism.  George argues that both religions have flaws and accuses the hosts of unfairly generalizing about Muslims.  A heated exchange ensues, filled with insults like "liberal," "liar," "idiot," and "dishonest little man," as the hosts aggressively challenge George's assertions, particularly his claim that honor killings aren't barbaric. The discussion repeatedly circles back to comparing the Catholic Church's pedophilia scandal and instances of extreme violence within some interpretations of Islam.

Following the call, the hosts play messages from their "FU Line," filled with highly offensive language.  They then give away tickets to Jimmy's New Year's Eve show, requiring callers to use the password "George is a douche."  The show continues with discussions about the abolition of the death penalty in New Jersey, a prison break in Union County, New Jersey, and the Alcatraz audio tour, interspersed with more listener calls, "FU" messages, and offensive comments about Michael Jackson's appearance and Pam Anderson's divorce. The segment ends with the song "Dink Fries Are Done" and final comments about the hosts' upcoming vacation.

The next segment starts with a discussion of listener radio habits and their associations with Opie and Anthony and other programs like Art Bell.  A “beep game” segment using a censored version of “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” is played. The show then discusses a video of a man playing a recorder unconventionally, the origin of the “beep game,” and promotes their online content, including Anthony's video podcast.  A large portion of the show is dedicated to discussing two incidents involving children and alleged “weapons” at school: a kindergartener's bomb threat and a fifth-grader's steak knife.  The hosts and callers express outrage at what they see as excessive zero-tolerance policies. A juvenile criminal defense attorney calls in to discuss similar overreactions.  A listener's terrible voiceover audition tape is played and heavily criticized.  Comedian Mike DiStefano joins the show, sharing anecdotes about comedy clubs, including a physical altercation with a club owner and his experiences with censorship.  The segment ends with further discussion of DiStefano's experiences and frustrations.  Offensive language is frequent throughout.

Mike DiStefano remains as a guest, discussing differences in comedy show audiences, difficult audience members, and relating an anecdote about an offensive joke he told about raping a stripper. The conversation shifts to audience reactions, accusations against themselves compared to Bill Cosby, and fellow comedians Rich Voss and Bobby Kelly. DiStefano details his past heroin addiction starting at age 15, his criminal activities to support his habit, his recovery, and his Buddhist beliefs, while acknowledging his violent tendencies.  He shares stories of physical altercations, including an underwater fight. He discusses his late wife and his father's death.  Dr. Doody then joins, analyzing pictures from RateYourDuty.com, a website featuring pictures of people's feces, leading to graphic descriptions and jokes about bowel movements. The conversation shifts between humorous anecdotes and serious discussions of DiStefano's life experiences. The segment ends with promotion of DiStefano's New Year's Eve show with Jim Florentine and a brief discussion of rumors about Jim Florentine and Robin Quivers.

A phone interview with Dr. Doody follows, focusing on colon cleansing and bowel movements, with frequent references to graphic images from RateYourDuty.com.  Dr. Doody promotes his "Aloese" colon cleanse, emphasizing the length of eliminations (up to five feet).  The hosts and Dr. Doody engage in vulgar and sexually suggestive humor, including jokes about farts, anal seepage, and the "Two Girls, One Cup" video. They discuss pictures from RateYourDuty.com and touch upon Dr. Doody's personal life. The hosts also discuss a previous incident where they ran over a drug dealer.

The show ends with a potential guest (or job applicant) jokingly presenting an unconventional resume highlighting their history as a drug addict and former drug counselor, with the hosts anticipating a lengthy and unpleasant future segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocs, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocs, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  If you want to put it, feel free. I've done it before.  I'll let you go from to my and that's really sick.  This is where entertainment is going.  More audio V-Rock in the bathroom.  Boom!  They are sick freaks. 
[00:01:00]  Can you pop this there? I want to see something squirt out.  Aim it over there.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  What the what?  What the?  Who the what the?  I wasn't sure if I could say that word.  I had to stop myself.  What the heck went on in here last night?  My chair's busted.  The headphones are busted.  Well, apparently there was a band in here last night.  What band?  I don't know.  But they were performing or something.  There's a lot of shenanigans that go on in this studio at night.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because it's all captured on the one camera that we don't use. 
[00:02:00]  That camera over there?  Yeah.  You could kind of peek in on Pal Talk.  Yeah.  You could peek in, peer in.  And yeah, I guess they were fussing with some stuff.  What band was in here?  I need to know.  They obviously were rocking.  Someone know.  My chair's busted.  I can't use that today.  Hey, what was the name of the band that was in here last night? 
[00:02:30]  And the headphones, one piece is pretty much completely off.  I had to reattach that just so I could hear myself today.  What?  Go ahead.  Do you rock?  The Bravery.  Oh, The Bravery.  The Bravery.  You know them?  I don't know.  Rock!  You know them?  Yeah, they're all right.  They have like one cool song.  What do they play?  One cool song three or four times?  I think they just played one cool song.  We're going to play our one cool song three or four times.  And the fourth time, we're going to go long form with it. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  I'm starting to really like Amy Winehouse.  What is wrong with you?  Well, my girlfriend.  Her shenanigans?  Stop with the therapy.  No, no, no.  Stop with the mumbo-jumbo therapy.  Amy puts me in touch with me.  Oh, my.  No, she wrote a good song.  It was on my alarm clock.  It was a CD.  It was a song my girlfriend put in,  which, of course, she was thinking of me.  Yeah.  Well, what song?  To know him is to love him.  Oh, my God.  Which is very good.  It's very true.  Stop going to therapy. 
[00:03:30]  It's ruining this radio show.  No.  Yesterday, Jimmy brought his mumbo-jumbo therapy  to the Opie and Anthony show  and pretty much shut down the show for about two hours.  Is that the style of therapy?  He takes mumbo-jumbo.  He completely shut down the show with this therapy thing.  Psycho babble.  Trying to get me in therapy.  I think you were hinting that Anthony needs therapy.  You're trying to tell the world how great therapy is. 
[00:04:00]  Everyone, I think, at some point in their life  should sit and maybe just talk to someone  that's more open-minded than your friends, family, or yourself.  But now he's introducing Amy Winehouse  to the Opie and Anthony show.  This I have a problem with.  And what song was it again?  To know him is to love him.  To know him is to love him.  I went and bought the album.  You better hope she doesn't really know you. 
[00:04:30]  Do you have that, E-Rock?  Of course not.  Don't find it.  To know him is to love him.  Yeah, I'm very sweet.  She does have a fine voice.  And, you know, if I happen upon rehab,  I'll crank it up a little bit so I can do the no and no.  No, no, no.  I like that part.  But that's it.  That song's catchy.  Yeah.  I don't know if I'd leave it on if it comes on.  Like, but. 
[00:05:00]  And no, and no, and no.  Yeah, it's, you know.  Where's our version of this, E-Rock?  Why would the Grammy stuff be in front of me?  Don't point over here.  That ain't.  Help.  Look at him run.  Step and fetch it.  Thank you.  That's our E-Rock.  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  Yes, boss.  Yeah.  Comes running over.  Boss, we have it right here.  It's right here, boss.  Right here, boss.  We all forgot about the fact that you almost died on our show.  Oh, that's old news. 
[00:05:30]  Good to know everything's back around here.  Old news.  This is Roland doing that same exact song because it's a Grammy nomination.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute.  Song of the Year.  Rehab.  Amy Winehouse.  They try to take eight mil to rehab.  I said no, no, no.  Yes, I've been black.  But when I come back, you will know.  Oh, no, no, no.  I ain't got the time. 
[00:06:00]  If my daddy thinks I'm fine.  He's trying to take me to go to rehab.  I won't go, go, go.  Expand your Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony.  I like how he's got to swallow midline.  Yeah.  To re...  Have I...  I did one of these yesterday.  Yes.  We heard the raw tracks.  And I wanted it to be...  I wanted it to be good. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, no.  I didn't go in there like...  Well, nobody's going in there and trying to be goofy.  Yeah, they're just singing like they would sing.  Like, I try to do a little falsetto, and I really, really put my all into it.  And we played it yesterday late in the show, and it pretty much shut down the Opie and Anthony  show.  Between Jimmy's rehab and this thing...  Here's what Opie was hoping for, that we would do it and go, ah-ha, and then go, you  know what?  God damn it.  The kid's good.  The kid's good. 
[00:07:00]  And, uh, well, I don't know.  I don't know if we should play this, because it's so...  It's one of these moments where people don't know what to say.  These guys didn't want to comment about it after I did it.  I want to hear it.  I want to hear it.  Then some feedback.  They were all doing just their Beavis and Butthead.  Like, they're...  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Like...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then I asked Tim.  I said, Tim, are people laughing at me and with me, or just at me? 
[00:07:30]  And he said, well, they're laughing with you and at you.  Isn't the most important thing just the fact that they're laughing?  No one has said...  That's what I say.  No one has said about this audio you're about to hear.  I was truly trying.  Yeah.  To get something good.  And this is how it came.  Very hard with a falsetto, by the way.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute.  Best female pop vocal performance.  Big girls, don't cry. 
[00:08:00]  30.  I hope you know, I hope you know, that this has nothing to do with you.  It's personal, myself and I.  We've got some straightening out to do.  And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket.  But I gotta get a move on with my life.  It's time to be a big girl now. 
[00:08:30]  And big girls, don't cry.  Don't cry.  Don't cry.  Don't cry.  Don't cry.  Expand your Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony.  Okay, terrific.  Oh, good Lord.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life. 
[00:09:00]  Wow.  Wow.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  How pathetic is that?  Look, I'll jump on the pile here, no problem, even though it's myself.  How pathetic is it that I can't even keep up with a song that is a really slow one?  Well, I can't even keep up with it.  Now, when you sang that, did you hear the song in your head? 
[00:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  It was playing in the headphones.  Oh, okay.  I was wondering.  And I couldn't keep up with the damn chick.  I guess that was kind of an insult there.  If I have to ask if you had the music playing in your headphones, that's bad.  I thought maybe you were just winging it without music, and then they put it to the music.  That one part, there's just too many words to fit in.  Yeah, you got to shoehorn them in there a little bit.  Yeah.  The reviews are coming in.  We're laughing at you. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, I know.  Look, I tried.  I tried.  I hope he makes Tippy Tom sound like Sinatra.  Maybe I need to do another one.  Well, maybe that wasn't your song.  No, maybe I can't do the falsetto.  Yeah, the falsetto thing is very difficult to make sound good.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to James in New Hampshire.  James, what's up, buddy?  Hey, how's it going, fellas?  Hey there, James.  Hold on.  Someone's saying I'm full of ass and says I wasn't trying. 
[00:10:30]  That's me trying.  Oh, yeah.  That was me trying to keep up with the song and hit a couple high notes.  Absolutely.  Falsetto's impossible for a lot of guys.  It's just not, you can't get power out of it.  It's hard to keep your pitch right with it.  It's very difficult.  Right.  All right, James.  Go ahead.  First thing is just start writing your Grammy acceptance speech now, my friend.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Someone that liked it.  Thank you.  The second thing is, did you happen to bring in your stinky pants for Extreme Male Camel Toe Tuesday? 
[00:11:00]  Now, a lot of people were, you know, it even popped into my head this morning.  Did Opie bring his stinky pants?  Of course, yesterday, Opie let us in on a little information, a little too much information.  He was hanging out with his, don't say.  And the Philly crew.  And the Philly crew, her family.  I've brought the Philly crew into many discussions on the Opie show.  Yes.  And apparently, he was working out for a while in these sweatpants. 
[00:11:30]  What I do really fast, I like to hit the gym and I like to wear clothes.  Where am I going with it?  So sweatpants.  You're wearing your sweatpants.  And when I come home, I take the sweatpants off.  They're those thick ones that just absorb all moisture, by the way.  Yeah.  I mean, it soaks up the moisture, it's like heavy cotton, and then I just kind of hang  them on the back of the door in the bathroom until next time I need to go to the gym.  Not good.  See, I don't go to the gym as a fashion plate. 
[00:12:00]  I just throw on dumb sweatpants, an old shirt.  There's a pretty big chasm between fashion plate and swampy butt.  There's a middle ground there of washing the sweats after each use.  What I'm trying to say, when I go to my gym, I see a lot of people that kind of showing off for each other with their nice workout outfits.  Well, that's silly.  I'm not one of those guys. 
[00:12:30]  No.  I got my baggy gray sweatpants that show off my package very nicely.  That's wonderful.  Especially when I'm doing my...  Oh, look at that.  James is liking it.  Especially when I'm doing my back braces to take care of my herniated disc.  So, you know, your pelvis is way up in the air, and these sweatpants show off the area nice when you're just standing up straight.  It's rusting.  I've seen girls drop weights.  Whoa.  Shortens the distance for the bench press.  They're dropping weights to hold their nose, apparently. 
[00:13:00]  Anyway, so I don't think about these sweatpants.  I wear them, and I put them on the hook until next time.  Yeah.  But don't you think maybe they're getting a little stinky around the back end?  It's more of a guessing game.  Just every once in a while, I go, ah, just throw these in the wash.  I'm not really...  I don't know why I don't do the sniff test with my sweatpants, but I do with my jeans and everything else.  I get every other guy out there.  I think you could assume that if you're working out in it, it needs to be washed after every single use. 
[00:13:30]  At least every 30th.  Yeah.  So, and I've been doing the exercise bike a lot at the gym because, you know, I can't get out there.  It's a little too cold to be running and doing some of that inline skating, and I jump on my exercise bike and do the trail.  Jimmy knows on the west side there.  So exercise bike is kind of, kind of, it captures a lot of moisture.  Well, that would be the one that would probably give the crankiest of crank when you're sitting down, you're working hard. 
[00:14:00]  Dude, there are times when I even just get ready to get on the exercise bike.  I smell someone else's swamp ass.  Oh.  That's how bad those seats are in the gyms.  Don't your gym have, we have something that you spray on it when you're done, like a little spray.  Oh, that would be nice.  That would be called considerate.  Hydrochloric acid.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Just burn away anything.  To fast forward, on Sunday, I'm hanging with the Philly crew, watching some football, watching the Pats, obviously. 
[00:14:30]  And I kept getting up off the couch, and I'm catching a whiff of something.  You certainly must have been.  Trying to keep it clean.  Catching a whiff, all right?  And a pretty significant whiff, by the way.  And also, I'm like, God, these guys, because we went to the Rana Fez Winter Carnival.  I'm thinking these guys got, like, beer farts or something.  I'm blaming it on them, because there's three of them, me, and my fiancée. 
[00:15:00]  Fiancée.  And I kept getting up, and I'm smelling this funk, and I'm ready to blame those guys.  And then, Kenny, Lindsay's brother, finally goes, did you fart?  Because he loves farting in front of everybody.  Oh, no.  Because his are horrific.  Oh, no.  They asked.  His are horrific.  They asked if you...  And at that point, I'm like, oh, my God, I think it's me. 
[00:15:30]  And then I just went about the rest of my afternoon not really worrying about it.  You even had, like, a pre-warning.  Oh, yeah.  And then when the Philly crew left, Lindsay finally went to me, you stink.  Oh, Lindsay had to tell you that was the most embarrassing part.  She finally had to tell me that it was my sweatpants, and it's been a problem all afternoon long.  And then I went into the bathroom feeling, like, very just embarrassed.  Of course.  And I took off the sweatpants, and then at that point, I did the sniff test, and oh, my God, it almost floored me.  It was so bad that even though, I said this yesterday, even though no one was around, I was completely embarrassed for myself. 
[00:16:00]  Completely embarrassed.  You know how bad it has to be to embarrass yourself when you're alone?  Well, it's bad because not only did she notice, but her extended family noticed.  Yeah, but, you know, Kenny's cool, though.  Like, he brags about it.  Of course he is.  He laughs at that stuff.  But it's all the chick.  It's the fact that your chick notices that the back of your sweatpants smells bad.  It's like, ugh.  Right.  I get it.  It's embarrassing.  Right.  And by the way, the other thing that I was talking about late in the show, I'm good today. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  So, I think it was the wasabi.  You know, um.  The wasabi making mud.  Yeah.  You got to have Kenny go get them.  Making mud.  You have to have Kenny get them this morning.  What?  The sweats.  They have to be done.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you just blew it, Jimmy.  So, what I was going to say, James, I'm finally getting back to you.  I'm getting ready to leave today, and I see the sweats laying next to the hamper, and I  pick them up, and I picked them up, and I'm like, maybe this was, like, overblown. 
[00:17:00]  So, I gave them another sniff test.  Just awful.  Wow, it floored me.  And then, I got to be honest, I was too embarrassed to bring them in.  That's all.  Because I'm thinking, this is what I was thinking as I was leaving.  They're still there.  No one's touching them.  But I was thinking, if I bring these sweatpants in, these guys are going to really start thinking  I'm nuts.  I know you already think that, but this would take it to another level.  Yeah.  So, I need to know, do you guys really want me to bring these in? 
[00:17:30]  I want you to just so an intern has to smell it.  Yes.  Like, I want no part of it.  I don't want to even get close to them.  Oh, I understand that.  But to see an intern have to smell it would really be pleasurable.  But see, we were having fun yesterday on the radio, and then, you know.  So, the day goes by, you get a good night's sleep.  There you go.  Jesus.  What?  Oh, the day goes by.  Yes, yes.  Okay. 
[00:18:00]  I thought you were slighting at me.  I'm thinking, maybe that was yesterday's show, and maybe we should just move on.  And I'm thinking, if I, like, you know, put this in a brown paper bag and walk in today,  you guys are going to, like, I don't know.  You're going to call a hospital or something.  You're doing a Sopranos ending on us.  Bring the goddamn things in.  You really want them in.  Of course.  Jimmy.  Not only do I want them in.  Yeah.  But I literally want, before the end of this show, I want Kenny to drive there, and your  girl can have them ready, or just put, like, Kenny in or whatever.  She's in a biohazard suit with tongs. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  She's a Dustin Hoffman.  And Outbreak.  Outbreak.  And a stick and a Geiger thing.  E-Rock, do you want them?  The monkey smells better than the pants.  Let's ask E-Rock.  E-Rock, you want me to bring him in?  Sure.  You know who's going to smell him, right?  Not me.  E-Rock's like, I paid my dues by almost dying the other day.  He really did.  Screw you and your pants.  Wait, I have an idea.  How about this?  You bring him in.  Yeah.  And because E-Rock gets dumped on a lot by a lot of the guys, how about E-Rock gets to 
[00:19:00]  pick who smells them?  Yeah.  I would like Eric to be able to pick who smells them.  This is really embarrassing, though.  What?  Can I just clear something up?  Yeah, go ahead, James.  I just want to make sure.  So you decided it was a better idea to leave the stinky sweatpants with your 11 fiancée  than give them to an intern.  Just checking.  Just checking.  Well, they're kind of off on their own at this point.  The bottom line is this.  I got so many rooms in my new place, my sweatpants have their own room right now. 
[00:19:30]  The bottom line is this.  The girlfriend is the main one.  Once she's smelled them, she's the one you want to protect.  She's the one you have sex with.  But once she's smelled them, all bets are off.  It doesn't matter who else smells them.  Right.  She's the only one that counts, and she happened to be the first one.  So true.  If you're in agreement, then they'll come in either later today or tomorrow at the latest.  Got to get them.  Later today, because you don't want that fermenting smell to go anywhere.  It is.  You got to strike while the iron's hot.  I'm thinking, trust me, they're not going anywhere. 
[00:20:00]  And you know what I'll do for you guys?  I'll run the stairs today in them.  Oh, God.  Reactivate it.  It's like Jerry Curl.  Sometimes you got to put the reactivator on.  I'm going to reactivate today because I run the stairs in my new place just to get a little exercise.  So I'll run the stairs today in the sweatpants just to make sure we're ready to go tomorrow.  Okay?  All right.  All right.  Thank you, James.  Fans are pro stinky pants, my friend. 
[00:20:30]  All right, sir.  Peace out, guys.  Thanks for listening.  We greatly appreciate that.  We'll go to break.  We got a brand new Steve C.  Remix.  This bit's kind of going away.  But it still has a little life.  Yeah, we're only a few days away from taking a week off.  And when we get back, I'm sure this will be buried.  But basically, it's the sounds of Steve.  The sounds of Steve.  Before he actually does production for the Opie and Anthony show, he warms up his voice by making all sorts of weird noises.  And the fans have been taking these weird noises and putting them in key moments in songs you know and love. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Four non-blondes.  This song is catchy.  I cranked this up every once in a while.  Yeah, remember this one.  Big hit.  Until I wake in the morning and I step outside.  And I take a dip off and I get real high.  And I dream from the top of my lungs.  What's going on?  In our damn day.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, oh.  I'm saying.  Ha, ha.  And there you have it.  Enough of that.  All right, well, actually, we'll officially go to break on the Opie and Anthony show with Drew Boogie. 
[00:22:00]  He is the master.  One of the better ones we got, right, through this whole process.  Although the Metallica one, we might have to replay one.  That one's really good.  We'll play that a little later.  But first, Drew Boogie.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  We'll go to the phones next.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What? 
[00:22:30]  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Oh, I didn't realize, huh? 
[00:23:00]  It's Opie and Anthony, and you listening wherever you are.  Phone number 877-212-0NA.  Eh, Leno and Conan O'Brien and what? 
[00:23:30]  And I think Letterman all coming back to do their late-night shows without writers?  Yeah, I guess eventually you have to, man.  Self-preservation.  You can respect the writers by not hiring scab writers and not having guys come in and take their jobs.  Shows won't be as good without the writers.  But it's a tough one when you're a daily show like that.  You can't allow it.  I think what they're afraid of is that there's huge staffs with these and that they're going to be fired by the network.  And when you fire the staff, the staff eventually will have to get other jobs. 
[00:24:00]  And a lot of these guys are irreplaceable.  I think.  I'm guessing.  And these writers aren't asking for much.  No, I think they should absolutely get what they want.  The technology has changed in such a way, a lot of people are making a lot of money out there.  They just want their little piece.  Just a little piece.  The writers got screwed on, I think, on DVDs or something.  And, you know, they gave a concession.  And, of course, the big companies.  We don't make any money, really.  That's why you do it for free.  Yeah, they always say that.  They don't make money.  Oh, the advertising costs so much.  It's such crap. 
[00:24:30]  And I don't know all the details, but the writers just want a piece of the cake.  They write this stuff.  Yeah.  Speaking of online downloads, you were telling me something very interesting in the office.  And I did see, like, the opening clip, but I didn't realize there were 15 of them.  Oh, my God.  We're talking about I Am Legend is online on YouTube.  Yeah.  I went home, and I troll through YouTube.  And I never know how I really get anywhere on YouTube, but I ended up I Am Legend. 
[00:25:00]  And there was about 20 parts, I guess, that some guy put up.  And it was a camcorder that he had in the movie theater.  And the entire movie was up there.  So I wanted to see the opening sequence because, you know, it looks very cool.  You described it.  And it's got the same Shelby Mustang that I have in it.  So I wanted to kind of check that one out.  The exact same one, by the way.  Yeah, it's the same exact car, color, everything.  Yep.  So I checked that out, and then that part ends. 
[00:25:30]  And they're all, like, five- to six-minute clips.  But it's the entire movie in five-minute segments.  So I watched that, and then it ends at a point where I'm like, well, I've got to see what happens next.  So I hit the next part, and then the next part.  And I realized after watching about 15 minutes, about three segments, I said, you know, I'm going to sit here and watch this entire great movie that should be seen on the big screen in a YouTube, you know, crappy quality postage stamp on my computer screen. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, by, what, six inches by four inches?  If that, yeah.  All, like, nasty quality and stuff.  So I had to drag myself away and not watch it.  Was it good?  Yeah.  From what I saw, it was really cool.  So I kind of just closed the window and said, I can't do this.  I can't watch it like this.  Well, do you think that the I Am Legend movie people would be mad that it was on YouTube?  I'm sure they would be. 
[00:26:30]  It's probably not going to be there now.  And, you know, speaking of videos online, I was going to finally take a look at your video podcast.  But, you know, you decided to do a Lord of the Rings thing as far as podcasts go.  It's the Lord of the Rings version of podcasts because it's 20 minutes long.  Well, for a podcast, that's very long, Anthony.  Well, I was telling you for weeks, will you edit this dumb thing down?  It's not a masterpiece.  It's you in your home being completely psychotic about your guns.  Make it five minutes so a lot more people know it has to be seen in its entirety. 
[00:27:00]  Actually, I consider this the pilot episode of my Anthony's Office series.  I understand that.  So it was like a special, huge version.  It's 20 minutes long.  I really didn't think it was going to be 20 minutes long.  I didn't want to edit it down and do any of that.  So I just kind of put it out there.  Laszlo did a bunch of sound effects and stuff on it and music. 
[00:27:30]  Did a great job.  And I popped it up there.  You know, it's 20 minutes.  It's a small file.  That's why the quality, it could be better video-wise.  But in order to make it fit anywhere.  The quality could be better, too, if you knock this down to five to seven minutes.  That's what I mean.  It has to be five minutes.  You're kind of a pompous ass in the video podcast world.  Exactly.  You're not Peter Jackson.  You're not.  I'm the Peter Jackson of podcasts.  This better not be a trilogy. 
[00:28:00]  No.  No.  This is the only one that's going to be this long.  All the rest are going to be five minutes long.  Five minutes, no more.  I didn't realize because I didn't realize.  Because I set everything up and then I sit down in my chair and I just started going off just talking.  You didn't have a script or anything.  So I didn't know how long I was going to go.  And then I realized I went over 25 minutes.  I did cut a couple of things out.  But I went over like 20 minutes and it didn't seem like that. 
[00:28:30]  Another hint.  Keep the alcohol out of it.  Well.  And then you'll edit yourself.  I think it was a little more.  I see.  I'm looking at it right now.  It's you with a cocktail.  I think the cocktail had something to do with the length of the thing.  Well, I had to take a sip for drama.  It was dramatic pause.  And the clinking of the ice in the glass I think really set the mood.  It set the mood.  But you've got a straw.  Yeah, the quality of the original, though, right off the camera is amazing. 
[00:29:00]  But, you know, you've got to put it online so you don't want it up there at 120 gigs.  This is how it was meant to be seen, man.  Yeah.  Director's cut.  It's the director's cut.  Yuck.  You're right, though.  He has a pompous boob.  Oh, I am.  You know what?  If you could get away with it, you'd have a smoking jacket.  I was thinking of a smoking jacket.  Yeah, you're going to need some costumes. 
[00:29:30]  Yes, a few costume changes.  Because you and a T-shirt and your comfy chair, you look like a big comfy chair guy.  The chair's a little big for you.  I do realize.  No, well, I know.  I wanted it to be a big pompous chair in a pompous room and me talking like a complete lunatic about my paranoia of home invasion.  And I think that came off.  I could have cut it down.  This will, for people that complain that it's too long, I understand. 
[00:30:00]  The rest will not be this long.  But I think you should watch this as a service to yourself and your family.  Couldn't this have been five seconds?  No!  Gun's good.  Home invaders.  Bad!  Protect yourself!  I had to put things in the little TV screen and see that.  I think it helps spread the word to people to be safe in their home.  And I talk about how embarrassing it would be to have something happen in your house because then you've got to move.  I had a decision I had to make last night.  Do I watch Anthony's long video podcast or another episode of Little People Big World? 
[00:30:30]  And you lost out to midgets last night.  It's a video podcast.  So with 20 minutes, it's like if you put commercials in, it's a half hour TV show.  Yeah, but it's just you in a chair.  Yes.  No one wants to look at you for 20 minutes.  I'm discussing things and there are things popping up on the TV screen.  How about another camera angle or something?  Don't you watch 60 Minutes?  I'm going to do that.  Actually, my next one, I'm going to have a camera kind of to the side behind me. 
[00:31:00]  So occasionally in black and white, you'll see the camera and the lighting and everything and still hear me talking.  So that way you'll get like that back view.  So it kind of takes you out of it and puts you in where you see the camera and the equipment.  He's in a chair for the whole time.  It's a real sitcom.  And where can they see this video podcast?  All you have to do.  Thank you, Laszlo, is go to Laszlo.com.  That's easy. 
[00:31:30]  L-A-Z-L-O-W.  L-O-W.  And I believe all this info will be up on ONARadio.com later today.  And it's making its way around already.  People are reposting it in other places, other websites.  But Laszlo is a great guy.  Check out his stuff on there, too.  It's right on the front page.  Where is it being reposted?  I think it's on Dig.  Dig?  And, yeah, somebody else mirrored it.  I mean, mentalinstitute.org.  Yeah.  Whack bag.  You know, it's just, it's popping up. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  It'll get around.  And people that have seen it, the reviews are in.  A lot of people agree.  A lot of people also call me a complete lunatic.  Well, that's what they're calling you on the Instant Feedback today.  Yes.  But why pay attention to that?  A complete lunatic.  Yeah, a complete lunatic.  Why don't you wear your Charlie Brown shirt for the podcast, by the way?  People are goofing on my Charlie Brown shirt, too.  I knew it when I took it out of the closet today.  I'm like, I like the striped shirt, but I just want to move a football out of your way. 
[00:32:30]  It's a striped shirt.  Yeah, let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max, what's up?  How's it going, fellas?  Hey.  I was going to ask Opie if he saw that Little People Big World where they're having that  like midget soccer game, and the guy, every time he kicked it out, you know, you have to  throw the ball over your head back into play, and he kept bumping it off his head because  his arms were too short. 
[00:33:00]  Don't make fun of my Little People Big World.  That show's creepy, Opie.  It's freaking creepy, dude.  Yeah, it is kind of creepy, but.  I keep it out every time I watch it.  What is so bizarre about the show, it's this midget couple, and they had three kids, one,  two, three, four kids, and three are not only regular size, but they're tall.  Like, they got a son that's 17, he's over six foot tall already, the daughter is easily 
[00:33:30]  five, five, five, six, and she's 14 years old, and then they had one midget kid.  So the midget mom and dad had one midget kid and three normal-sized kids that are really  tall for their age.  And good-looking, too.  Good-looking kids.  How does that work?  What a, just, what an injustice.  And you know what, next week on Little People Big World, I think it's the season finale,  they deal with Matt Roloff's drinking and driving.  A little fidget likes to drink and drive, huh? 
[00:34:00]  Well, the little boy not.  He probably just wants to hit an abutment and end it.  I don't think he's an alcoholic.  I think his problem is that one beer puts him over the limit, probably.  Two beers tops.  And he says, yeah, they caught me, you know, kind of going over the double yellow line, so.  Oops.  So it's the whole court case of him dealing with his drinking and driving on the next  Little People Big World.  Speaking of your home invasion thing, Danny brought this to the show today.  Listen to this.  It's only been a day. 
[00:34:30]  Hey, I missed Mark so much already.  How am I ever going to handle a whole week without him?  Um, he's going to be calling tonight.  Don't worry.  Okay.  Love you too.  Bye.  Hello?  So, it looks as if your little Marky boy doesn't look after his toys while he's away.  Lights out.  911, what's your emergency?  I think there's somebody trying to break in my house. 
[00:35:00]  I haven't got a couple of minutes.  Well, there you have it.  Horror movies don't have to last two hours if you have a quality firearm from Totally Awesome  Guns and Range.  Oh, jeez.  Where is that from, Danny? 
[00:35:30]  It's from a real place in Utah.  That's a real commercial?  It never aired because the guy sold the place before it actually aired, but that was to air.  That was to air.  It's a real gun store in Range.  What a great way to sell guns, man.  Yeah.  Screw all those horror films where the teenage girl's scared to death alone in your house.  That very last clip, you see the guy, he's about to start fidgeting with the lock on this glass door,  and she's just standing there like Rambo with some kind of assault rifle. 
[00:36:00]  All right, let's see how to Matt in Cleveland.  Good afternoon to Cleveland, by the way.  How are you, Matt?  Oh, I'm doing good.  Hey, the midget kid and the call kid are twins.  I'm Little People Big World.  Yeah, see, I'm not the only one.  Yeah, they're twins.  And the one kid is 4'2", and 85 to 90 pounds, and his twin brother is, I think, over six foot at this point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  And his-  That sucks for the fidget. 
[00:36:30]  No, it really sucks because they're at that age where the girls are coming around.  Yeah.  And six foot guy is getting all the chicks, although his girlfriend's a bit chubby.  I don't know what that's about.  And midget guy has to go to the midget conventions to get action.  Oh, the midget convention.  The hookup conventions for midgets?  Yeah.  Yeah, they go to some horrendous hotel in the middle of, like, Pittsburgh or something and have their convention, and then they meet their life partners that way.  Oh, that's wonderful. 
[00:37:00]  Thank you, Matt.  Yes, you're right about that.  Have a good day, guys.  Bye.  All right.  So that's a real commercial for guns.  And your video podcast, lazlow.com, L-A-Z-L-O-W.com.  Yeah, it's right there on the front page.  It's Anthony's office.  And, yeah, you can download it or just click it and watch it streaming on the page.  All right.  Hey, last night I got myself a Christmas tree.  Oh, the joyous time of year.  Yeah, I decided to get a 10-foot Christmas tree that weighed easily 100 pounds and drag it back to my apartment by myself. 
[00:37:30]  Like a caveman.  Halfway down the hill, I had visions of me dropping dead of a heart attack on the sidewalk with this massive Christmas tree on top of me.  Really?  Yeah.  Jimmy knows where I got the Christmas tree.  I do.  It was pretty effing far.  And I even asked the guy, I'm like, let me lift one of these before you wrap it up. 
[00:38:00]  I'm like, yeah, I think I could carry this thing.  Oh, man.  Like, I don't know, 20 yards into it, I realized how bad of an idea this was.  Why didn't you drive something down there?  Because driving in New York City is just a major hassle.  Yeah.  I got a car in the garage.  I could have waited 20 minutes to get the car, then drive it up there, which would be fine, but I wouldn't find any parking.  So then what's the use?  Then I would double park, but they don't let you double park because they give you a ticket right away.  It's a major hassle to have a car in the city to do little errands like that. 
[00:38:30]  You just can't do it.  Wow.  And the cabbies, they don't even want to look at you.  So I'm dragging this thing down the sidewalk and lifting it and sweating profusely.  And you know how cold it was in New York yesterday.  I was in full sweat mode, which, by the way, I was wearing long johns.  So the long johns are a bit ripe right now.  Yes, people are starting to ask, were you wearing your sweatpants?  So I'm dragging this tree back to the apartment where a lot of people from that other religion live. 
[00:39:00]  Ah, you live in a very Jewish building?  I do believe, yes.  A lot easier to carry a menorah up to your apartment.  Because when I finally got to the front door, they were looking at me like, A, I was crazy, and B, what is this strange thing you're bringing into the building?  What is that?  Get it out of here.  But I was reminded yesterday that, yes, I do indeed hate New Yorkers.  Can't stand them.  Can't wait for the day when I can move into the suburbs. 
[00:39:30]  I'm a suburb guy.  I hate living in Manhattan.  I really do.  But it makes it easy as far as doing this job, as Anthony goes.  So I'm lifting this tree and trying to get it back to the apartment.  It was a major hassle.  My girl was at school, so she can't help me.  Couldn't have wrote her a note to get her out.  And three things happened.  It's just a quick story.  A, no one would help me. 
[00:40:00]  And I mean help because everyone's going toward the same building.  It's pretty obvious.  Where I live, if you're on this one street, you're pretty much going to the building.  Yeah.  So these are kind of some of my neighbors.  Opie, people don't help people being raped.  Yeah, I understand.  Never mind carrying a Christmas tree.  I understand.  And they're going toward Jimmy's building where we live, right?  No one would help me.  No one even would acknowledge that I'm carrying this massive 100-pound tree by myself.  And finally, no one would get out of my effing way, even though I had a huge tree. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Welcome to the happiest time of the year in New York City.  And then I set it up in the stand because I had to jam it into the stand because the stand's too small.  Oh.  And then the whole thing fell over, so I've got to get a bigger stand now.  If you're going for a 10-foot tree.  Jimmy, it is a 10-foot tree.  I guess you have high ceilings, huh?  Yeah, it would go to the top of the ceiling easily, and it's massive. 
[00:41:00]  I can't explain how big this effing tree is.  You're going to need a lot of lights and decorations.  No, no, just a couple little things.  Oh, you don't go for the big...  No, I don't go nuts, no.  I barely want the thing in my apartment.  There's needles all over the place when you leave, when you take it out, and then you're still finding them in July.  You don't have a Christmas tree?  Not why.  I'm not spending it here.  Oh, that's right.  You're spending it in a hotel while your girl hangs out with her family.  In Colorado.  I'll be at the family's house. 
[00:41:30]  How the eff did you get that done?  I'll be at the family's house.  How did you get that done?  Just occasionally I'll be able to get away, because it's my vacation time, and I need to wind down a little bit.  I can't just the entire time be around the little kids and stuff.  Right.  Yeah, so I'm going to be in a hotel, and then I'll drop in during the day, and I'm back to the hotel.  I just...  That's amazing. 
[00:42:00]  Well, it's...  I love it.  It's a good thing.  It's absolutely the right thing to do.  Because I need sleep, and I wouldn't be getting that.  But you guys, this is rare.  You can't get away with this in the real world.  Yeah, but don't forget, when you get up at five in the morning and four in the morning, I mean, that's really early, and a lot of working people out there do.  But when you get a vacation, you want to sleep.  But it's life.  You can't just, like, take care of yourself around the holidays.  It sounds logical, Jimmy, but you're... 
[00:42:30]  We can take phone calls from people.  They're calling already.  They want to know how he got this done.  It's great.  Because everyone works their asses off and get a few extra days around the holiday off and would love to spend just sleeping in a big, comfy hotel bed while his girlfriend is at the house dealing with her mother and kids and the like.  Well, see, my girlfriend wants to be around the kids all the time.  I want to be around the kids when, you know, I could play with them, have some fun, things like that. 
[00:43:00]  But at night, at sleepy time, it can't happen.  But see, being around the kids all the time is like, that's like normal living.  Like, that's what normal people...  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Not me.  Yes, when it's family.  Well.  When it's family.  I would return to this program a tired wreck after this vacation if I didn't have, like, a release valve.  See, God bless you for thinking about this as a vacation. 
[00:43:30]  I'm thinking about it as, well, we got a few days off for Christmas, which is going to be spent doing last-minute Christmas shopping, panicking in a mall, and then doing a lot of visiting from house to house to house.  There's nothing relaxing about the last week of December.  I have to make it both.  You guys put your foot down.  Yes, you do.  Hey, look, I mean, when my Aunt Kay and Uncle Bill would come visit us, they would always stay in a hotel.  They never stayed with us.  They would always go, no, I don't want to put you out.  I'm not a person in someone's house person either.  I'm not very good at staying at people's houses for any length of time. 
[00:44:00]  I don't...  I like being able to just rip the clothes off, throw them on the floor, get into bed, watch movies loud.  No one is good with that, Aunt.  When I go down to Philly this Christmas, I sleep in a bed that barely fits my body.  See, why would you do that?  It's a little bed for both Lindsay and I.  It's barely...  It's...  What is it?  A single?  A twin?  What is it?  Yes! 
[00:44:30]  They're quarantining my room right now as I speak because I have allergies to their dog.  So they shut the door of this room for at least a month.  They air it out and get it all set for me.  And I will sleep in that room for two or three days.  Oh, hotel.  You've got to hotel it.  No way.  My girlfriend and I, we go to see her family.  We're in a hotel.  Because she likes to get back and relax and sleep in a hotel too.  Not that she doesn't want to see her family, but you know...  Yeah, you want to be able to just kind of...  I want to bang her.  I want to bang her loud.  I want to spank her. 
[00:45:00]  She doesn't like to be spanked.  Stop spanking me.  I don't want her family to hear that.  We're celebrating the birth of baby Jesus!  Exactly, in a hotel.  All that stuff can wait until after the holiday.  No way.  Hotels.  It's about family.  You can see family without staying.  Opening presents.  I don't stay with my parents anymore.  I'm drinking all that eggnog.  I don't blame Ant one bit.  I think you're 100% right.  I just like being able to do what you want to do. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  At night, you could just hop into bed.  Crap laying all over the place.  And in the morning, if you've got to go to the bathroom, you don't have to find in the dark,  reaching around, trying to find a robe or your pants or something.  You just get up and, you know, take a leak.  And also, I think for the people who you're staying with, I think a lot of times it's better for them if you're not there.  They have five minutes to breathe, and it's not eight people fighting for the same toilet.  No, the Philly crew wants us there. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, I've got to be in there.  They do.  They want us there.  I mean, logically it makes sense, but most people can't pull off what you're pulling off, Anthony.  That's all I'm saying.  I think next podcast, from the hotel.  I think that's live from the hotel.  The overlook in Colorado.  Yes, it is.  The overlook.  I'll be staying there.  You're just looking for excuses.  Well, I couldn't make it over today because I had to make my video podcast.  My podcast.  I had to get my podcast going.  You're not getting up until three in the afternoon to begin with, and then you've got to do your podcast. 
[00:46:30]  No, that phone will be ringing and getting me up, which is fine as long as...  See, the kids, little kids get up too goddamn early, especially around Christmas.  They're all excited, and I cannot be woken up at four in the morning, three in the morning, when we're off.  It would kill me.  It would kill the kids.  Believe me.  Those little necks will snap pretty easily because I'm still half asleep. 
[00:47:00]  All I'm saying is someday you're going to have to explain how you got this done.  It's amazing.  Well, most people go to their girlfriend or wife's family house, and that's just how it is.  It's just lovely.  Sleep in the guest room or the basement or on a pull-out couch, and that's just how it is.  It's just a nice compromise, is what it is.  All right.  She'll take another break here.  Look, you settle on that. 
[00:47:30]  I think it's good.  It's healthy.  I think that's a healthy compromise.  Yeah, it's not realistic.  If you're staying in New York and not going, like, oh, I'm not going, I'm doing that.  Where are you going for Christmas?  My girlfriend is seeing her family.  No, I'm kidding.  I'm actually going with her to, we're going to go away for a couple of days and stay in a place that you recommended.  Ah.  It's a good place.  Yes.  It's a Motel 8.  We're going on a place in upstate New York where hookers were murdered.  We're staying in those rooms.  We're going to laugh and tell stories. 
[00:48:00]  Tell dead hooker stories.  Wonderful.  Hotel 8 and what?  Wilkesbury?  Wilkesbury.  Wilkesbury.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  What was the biggest video game of 2007? 
[00:48:30]  Wow.  Biggest video game of 2007.  I didn't know this.  All the lists are coming out.  Yes, the end of year list.  End of year list.  What do you think was the top video game of the year?  We're trying to do the different ones.  Like, top movie and all that, it's pretty much who cares, but...  I know I'm playing Call of Duty 4.  That was number six. 
[00:49:00]  Number six?  That came out pretty late, though.  Yeah, it did.  That game kicks ass.  I haven't played a game in a long time that has held my interest like this and really like,  wow, I kind of want to play that game.  Right.  You know, other games you pick up and you're like, eh, you know, you sit around and go,  I guess I'll play that.  This one's just like, oh, get online, just stop massacring people, you get better, your 
[00:49:30]  stats get better, you get better weapons.  It's just, it added kind of a role play game to the first person shooter where you actually  level up throughout the ranks of the military, which is really cool.  Love that game.  But number six, huh?  Number six.  Well, because it came out late.  Yeah.  I would think probably, I know with all the hoopla that was around it, Halo, Halo was probably  it, too. 
[00:50:00]  Halo 3.  Well, so much.  Three, excuse me.  So much for that list.  Moving on.  That was it, huh?  Yeah, I thought so.  Usually you got to build, you know.  I'm not a Halo fan.  I don't even, I didn't even know which one was out.  One, two, three.  Halo 3 was the top selling or the top rated video game of the year.  Top rated.  Best video game of the year.  The Orange Box was number two at Half-Life 2 with Portal and Team Fortress 2.  Yeah, that one, like hotcakes off the shelves.  Sure.  Hotcakes.  Number three was Rock Band. 
[00:50:30]  Yep.  Four Super Mario Galaxy.  Then you got Bioshock, Call of Duty, Legend of Zelda.  Legend of Zelda.  Phantom Hourglass.  Still.  Still rocking.  And that Mario, that little WAP is still running around.  It just astounds me.  Yeah.  A game called Mass Effect.  I never heard of that one.  Hmm.  You know it, Stan?  Yes, it's a sci-fi RPG on the Xbox.  Oh. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, look at that.  Well.  And then you got Ace Combat 6 and rounding out the top 10, number 10, God of War 2.  Yes.  Top video games of 2007.  What's up, Jimmy?  I'm just reading this thing on Muslim brides undergoing vaginal surgery to re-virginize  them for wedding nights, and it just amazes me how people continue to say this.  Does it amaze you?  How peaceful they are.  Oh, okay.  I thought the whole concept amazed you.  I find it a little low-key for them. 
[00:51:30]  I'm surprised they don't just use dynamite.  They're barbaric to their women.  Yeah.  Liberals in this country defend Islam to the end.  They are barbaric and radical.  We know radical.  We get it.  They're barbaric.  On her wedding night, whatever her name is, will hand bloodied sheets to her in-laws  as proof of her virginity, according to a story in the Daily Telegraph in Australia.  Because she was like a modern English student, and she had lived with a boyfriend and stuff. 
[00:52:00]  She smoked, drank, and had sex.  But if the devout Muslim family of her soon-to-be husband or even her own family knew, she could  be murdered.  It's a surgery they do where they will restore your hymen surgically.  Where they either do it from torn tissue or a new membrane is inserted so that you bleed  on your wedding night.  Oh, my God.  And it says here, if my husband cannot prove to his family I'm a virgin, I would be hounded,  ostracized, and sent home in disgrace.  Her father would regard it as the ultimate shame. 
[00:52:30]  The entire family could be cast out.  Some of her more fanatical cousins or uncles may kill me in revenge to purge them of my sin.  Yeah, they stone them.  They bury them up to their neck.  Ugh.  And then throw rocks at their head.  Ugh.  Like baboons.  That's sad.  It's just beyond me how we continue to, in this country, be so...  These politicians are so politically correct and, you know, everyone needs human rights 
[00:53:00]  and equal rights for women and then the sexual harassment stuff.  Yet they will turn around and shake hands and do business with some of the most savage nations  on the face of the earth.  And if you criticize Islam, you're considered Islamophobic.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If they bash Islam, that's Islamophobic.  And they ignore this.  Yeah.  How about...  Yeah, is it reasonable to bash that or is it... 
[00:53:30]  Are you stepping on their religious beliefs by doing that?  It's amazing.  How many women are getting this done?  Is it a rare case?  Is it...  It's not common.  I mean, I think they said 25 or 30.  Right.  But the fact that it's an option because honor killings are accepted in a lot of parts of  the religion.  Yeah.  Right, right.  Say what you want about Christianity.  Honor killings.  It sucks sometimes.  And it's done a lot of stupid things.  But the majority of them weren't done this year.  This century.  You know, they're still not stoning people to death.  There was a Muslim woman who wrote an article, don't know her name, but it was a very good 
[00:54:00]  article about how the Muslim religion is a religion that is separated from the world  by time.  They just are...  It's archaic.  They are so behind the times that they haven't caught up with the civilized world yet as far  as their religious beliefs go.  And that's why they're so barbaric.  And, you know, Christianity was a very barbaric religion for many years. 
[00:54:30]  And that's kind of where they still are.  It's ridiculous.  That's kind of...  And why can't people just see that and call it out for what it is?  Because we have to be tolerant.  It's a religion of peace.  Tolerant.  It's not.  No, it's not.  It's not.  It's a religion of punishment in the severest form for not adhering to the religion.  Call it like you see it. 
[00:55:00]  That's what it is.  People's lives aren't of value to them.  It doesn't matter.  Let's go to George in Colorado.  George.  How you doing, Judge?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  You know, I get so tired of this.  Every time we turn around, the three of you, or at least Anthony and Jimmy, regularly attack  Muslims and Islam.  Hold on, dude.  Hold on, dude.  We didn't attack it.  We're not attacking it.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's a barbaric religion, right, Jimmy?  It's a barbaric religion.  I said, I said that is barbaric. 
[00:55:30]  You don't think that family members killing a girl to restore their own sense of honor  is barbarism?  No.  You don't.  Here's what's barbarism.  Largest religion in the United States is Catholicism.  Yes.  Recurrently protects pedophile freedom.  Agreed.  Yeah.  Okay?  Agreed.  So, Anthony, you're Catholic.  And you have a major national radio station. 
[00:56:00]  Why are you calling on protest in the street?  Why are you calling on protest on the Archdiocese?  We've attacked that plenty of times, dude.  We have talked about the problems with the Catholic Church and pedophilia ad nauseum.  We have absolutely talked about that.  Dude, and also, we do it all at home, dude.  You're not going to make an accusation and not listen to the answer.  We said that to Bill Donahue.  You're head of the Catholic League, and he's like, I can't disagree.  It's a major problem.  It's got to be fixed. 
[00:56:30]  So why don't you guys call on Donahue to do more?  Because we're not calling on anybody to do more.  And when I said to you, you don't think it's barbaric that they stone their women to death?  You said no.  Because that's the way that religion is.  I know dozens of Muslims I am good friends with.  Good for you.  It's going to be the same thing.  It's barbaric.  But they're nowhere near doing things like that.  We know that.  Every day, go to jobs just like you and I.  Listen, listen.  Guilt-ridden liberal.  I'm not talking about every single Muslim.  You're not as liberal? 
[00:57:00]  I've been a Republican my entire life.  Shh.  You're a liberal.  Shut your mouth.  You're not a Republican.  Shut up.  Okay.  Okay.  You know my political beliefs.  I have to.  I just said to you, do you think it's barbaric that they would stone their women and kill  their women over honor?  And you said no.  Hey, hey, let's discuss religion.  Son, son, you said no.  You said no.  That wasn't barbaric.  Jimmy, first off, let me challenge you to say you're calling me a liberal.  Okay?  I've been a lifelong NRA member. 
[00:57:30]  I own more guns than Anthony could dream of owning at the present time.  But I'm also pro-tory.  I'm upset.  Does that still make me a liberal?  I'm talking about this ideological thing you're talking about right now.  I'm not talking about who you vote for.  You're defending Islam on a principle like we're saying all Muslims are awful.  And you know that's not what we're saying.  So you're playing this stupid semantics game.  I just said to you, is it barbaric that they would kill a woman in their own family to purge  their own sins?  And you said no.  You explain that to me. 
[00:58:00]  My opinion is not because it makes Muslims and it makes Islam no different than any other  religion.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  Every religion has its own same items in various forms.  Oh, I see.  So because every religion has bad things, barbarism is redefined.  I see.  Okay.  So I guess pedophilia is not pedophilia then.  Since every religion has their own thing, I guess pedophilia is not pedophilia in Catholicism,  correct?  Well, too many Catholics, apparently it's not. 
[00:58:30]  The entire Catholic religion thinks it's disgusting.  And the archdiocese are paying billions of dollars, finally.  Really?  Yes?  We have Catholic archdiocese nationwide who refuse turnover records to prosecuting attorney.  Of course they do.  Dude, no one is saying, you're making these things like mutually exclusive.  Like, well, Islam can't be barbaric because they do this.  And no one is even disagreeing with you about the archdiocese. 
[00:59:00]  No one is thinking you're wrong.  What I get tired of is every time something comes up, no matter what about Muslims or Islam,  so many people refer to every Muslim into the same category.  But we didn't say that.  We didn't say that.  Also, you do it every time.  No, no, hold on.  Shut your mouth.  Why don't you?  Also, let me make this point.  You're talking about all your friends that you have that are Muslims.  It's American Muslims.  American of any religion is different than worldwide. 
[00:59:30]  You're looking at a very small picture.  Over the whole, let me speak, please.  Over the whole earth, the majority of Muslims aren't like the ones here in the United States that you see.  They are barbaric people.  Hey, have you traveled worldwide?  Dude, I don't have to travel to Saudi Arabia to know that there are rules in place that...  Not every Muslim country acts the same. 
[01:00:00]  You go to Dubai, the United Arab Emirates...  Yes.  Westernized Muslims.  Yes, you're right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're correct.  Well, go to Saudi Arabia.  Go to Iraq.  Right.  You're lumping a couple of nations into the whole thing.  A couple of nations?  A couple of nations?  You're out of your bird.  They were calling for the death of a woman for naming a teddy bear Mohammed.  Shut your mouth! 
[01:00:30]  Tim, have you ever been to Dubai?  No, and I'm not disagreeing with you about...  Stop saying Dubai.  We know there are plenty of Muslims that aren't like that.  We know that.  Okay, but you guys are trying to...  No, we're not.  You guys are trying to lump certain groups...  No, we're not.  ...certain sects of Muslims into with everyone?  No, we're not.  Don't speak for us.  Speak for you.  Stop finding westernized Muslims or more modern-thinking Muslims who aren't westernized but are modern-thinking.  Yeah.  No one's disagreeing with that.  But the modern and westernized Muslims... 
[01:01:00]  You don't think...  ...are a larger category than the radicals.  Oh, really?  Wrong!  Really!  Wrong!  It comes down to if these people are afraid to speak out.  Oh, why are they afraid?  Why?  Why are they afraid?  Why are they afraid?  Why is Dubai afraid to speak out?  He's stronger about the church.  He's not afraid to speak out.  He's a platter man.  He did.  On our show, we spoke out against pedophilia in the church.  Okay, but it takes the... 
[01:01:30]  I'm going to...  Oh, you're reaching.  You're reaching, kid.  I'm not.  Yes, you are.  ...people, two classes into the same category.  The modern, westernized, non-radical Muslims are afraid to speak out against the radicals.  Really?  Why is that?  Because they fear for their lives from the radicals.  Because they're barbaric?  Say it.  The radicals?  Yes, radicals are barbaric.  Do you think Bill Donahue led a protest down the street of a million Catholics calling on the archdiocese? 
[01:02:00]  Do you not think that the church would take steps against him?  No, they wouldn't.  No.  To be honest with you, Donahue is less likely to attack Catholicism than he is to attack other religions.  But that doesn't mean that we all understand that.  We know that.  We're talking about things like stoning people to death and families murdering a girl over an honor killing.  And you said that wasn't barbaric.  You're so caught up in making your point that you couldn't acknowledge that was barbarism. 
[01:02:30]  In my personal opinion, it's not barbaric.  In your opinion, it's barbaric.  Then you're asked.  How is it not barbaric to take a living human being, bury them up to the neck, and throw rocks at their head until they're dead?  How is that not barbaric in any sense of the word?  Because I am willing to accept that what happens within the confines of the religion.  What people believe specifically in that religion is the way that they are going to do things. 
[01:03:00]  Well, you know something?  In the modern civilized world, that doesn't wash.  And we cannot relate with these people on any level if that is the type of religion that they're practicing.  And you just gave yourself away.  Yeah.  You don't think it's barbaric.  You obviously have a hatred of certain, maybe it's Catholicism or whatever it is.  And you're trying to find an excuse as to why you should be defending.  What's that?  Of course you do.  You're a free thinker, man. 
[01:03:30]  We get it.  All religions bad.  Of course.  But every religion has its own bad parts to it.  So barbarism is not barbarism because every religion has bad parts to it.  Correct.  I'm willing to accept that.  Then you're an idiot.  You're a dummy.  I'm not.  Yes, you are.  You're a dumb person.  And you know what?  There's nothing that says, and it's not accepted, socially accepted, in the Catholic Church and amongst the parishioners to have priests molest children. 
[01:04:00]  But it is accepted and acceptable and adhered to by people in the Muslim religion to stone people to death in barbaric ways.  If it's not accepted in the Catholic Church, then why aren't the rules of the Catholic Church increasing?  Well, first of all, whatever the case is, yes, they should get rid of every pedophile in the Catholic Church.  But it doesn't say in the Bible, in the scriptures, to molest young children. 
[01:04:30]  It does say in the Muslim religion to stone a woman if she's not pure on her wedding night.  It also says...  That's barbaric.  That's a barbaric religion.  Why don't you just...  It also says, Cassidy, do you realize that you and your chick are living in sin at the Catholic Church and could both be excommunicated and sent to hell as far as the Catholic Church?  You see, that's all excommunicated.  You know something?  I don't think so.  And I don't think they're going to stone us to death or excommunicate us or anything else. 
[01:05:00]  That's the Catholic Church.  You're living in sin.  How many people are living in sin and not being excommunicated?  Probably about 35 couples.  Yeah.  In the U.S.  More than that.  What you're doing, dude, is you're being a liar.  You're being dishonest.  You're trying so hard to make your point.  You're not acknowledging certain truths that nobody would argue.  And that's why I think you're a liar.  Yeah, don't try to lump the Muslim religion that condones this type of barbarism with any other religion that has things going on that are against what the religion is about. 
[01:05:30]  You're just trying to make your point at the expense of being honest.  You know what?  I understand my feelings.  I know what I read and what I look at.  Good for you.  Good for you.  On a regular basis, in your opinion, I'm being dishonest.  In my opinion, I'm being honest.  You're a liar and you're trying to make your point. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  Thank you, George.  Thanks for the call.  You're desperate to make the point because when arguing, I'm not arguing in favor.  Hold on, sweetie.  I'm speaking.  I'm not arguing in the favor of Catholicism.  I think that the molesting priests are disgusting.  And I love the fact they've been hit for billions of dollars.  I completely agree with you.  They're not doing anything.  But the thing is, is the church is still doing too much to protect these people.  Okay, maybe you're right.  They're hiding too much.  You're right.  Nobody calls them out on it.  But that's the...  Dude, this is where you're being... 
[01:06:30]  Again, you're a liar or you're just a misinformed little boy.  No one is saying that that's right.  The church does overprotect them.  But to say that nobody in this country is calling them out on it...  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  It's a running joke on late night television.  Yeah.  The police are pedophiles.  What are you talking about?  Where do you live?  But to make fun of anything Muslim, now there's a problem.  Yes.  In the New York Post...  ...and I don't see the attacks on the Catholic Church on a regular basis.  Yes, you do.  Then you're a dummy.  Then you're not informed. 
[01:07:00]  You're not looking at political satire.  You're not looking at, like Jimmy said, late night TV, where every host makes fun of the Catholic Church when...  ...at a time when the late night TV...  But I see it on a daily basis, the Catholic Church saying, oh, we've turned over all records, and then suddenly more records...  But why, dude, why are you lying and saying that nobody calls them out on it in this country, when there has been a surge, and I think a needed surge, to calling them out on it, and to suing them...  Billions of dollars in restitution.  ...to going to jail. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Archdiocese are being bankrupt, and I think justifiably so.  So why are you lying and denying that?  I'm not lying.  Yes, you are.  I say it on a daily basis, Catholic Church is protecting these priests.  There are stories that have come out lately...  Right.  ...of the Catholic priests...  We're going in circles over here with this guy.  All right, George.  He doesn't see the point.  All right, George.  He's trying to equate...  Thanks, George.  ...the pedophilia in the Catholic Church, which is people are trying to deal with and addressing on a daily basis,  with a savagery of a religion that persecutes rape victims and stones women, beats women in the streets, 
[01:08:00]  and it's completely accepted.  The guy's an ass.  And he's just a dishonest little man trying to win an argument.  And that's that.  Okay.  Wow.  We've got to take a break.  Now that we've got everyone riled up, why don't we go to the FU line and see what's going on?  See what people are pissed off about today.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line. 
[01:08:30]  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have seven new voice messages.  First voice message.  F*** you to the motherf***er guy that did in my truck last night and stole my laptop, my digital camera.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give an FU to my export.  That motherf***er, he caught me a lot of money because he couldn't keep his f***ing mouth shut.  Next message.  Hey, yeah, I just wanted to say a big FU to my co-worker, Kevin, who all damn day walks around the office going, 
[01:09:00]  my name is William and I like female polish.  Kevin, f*** you.  Next message.  I want to give a big giant f*** you to everybody I work with, the f*** who says I can't park in front of my own f***ing house, who calls my boss to try and get me in trouble.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give an FU to the screener that I just called.  I've got a midget sighting. 
[01:09:30]  And not only is it a midget, it's a retard midget in a band full of retards.  He's turned around in the seat, jumped up and down, looking at me like the retard that he is.  Apparently, I riled him up when I gave him the finger.  So, your call screeners.  FU.  Next message.  I would like to say a big f*** you to Bob Kelly, who said that we could send him friend requests and he would accept them and he would be more than happy to play Xbox.  Well, f*** you, you haven't accepted any of my invites so far. 
[01:10:00]  Next message.  I want to say f*** you to my ex-wife and I hope she f***ing dies.  End of new messages.  Call the O.P. and Anthony FU line, 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Back already?  Yeah, back already.  Right.  O.P. and Anthony F.O. moving right along.  I'm trying to eat over here. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, we don't have time to eat, which I guess is good news for Tom here in New York.  Yeah.  We got live reads during the commercial breaks and usually during the commercials we try to shove some food down our gullets.  Yep.  And we're not able to even do that at this point.  So, I guess that's good news.  Hopefully.  That's good.  For New York, anyway.  What do you got, Jimmy?  I want to give a pair of these, actually two pairs of tickets away.  It's a prize package for my New Year's Eve show at the North Fork Theater here in Long Island. 
[01:11:00]  Each one is a pair of tickets to the show, a VIP pass, which means you come back and say hello, and a VIP parking pass.  The first two callers get it.  The password is George is a douche.  He was the caller from Colorado.  You have to say that to the screener.  George is a douche.  And you will get your pair of tickets and stuff.  First two callers.  Thank you.  Let's go to White Plains.  Tom, what's up?  George is a douche.  Oh, hey, Tom.  What's up?  This is Tom from Is Tom Alive Friday. 
[01:11:30]  Oh!  A bit we had to give up on because he just wouldn't die.  Yeah, that's kind of a good thing.  I feel good about that.  I'm going to tell you, that douche you had on the phone before the break, before I put a bullet through my head, I want to put one through his first.  That guy is a moron.  He was just a dope trying to prove a point.  And he couldn't concede a point.  He just had to keep arguing the same thing that, well, we're not going to tell you anything. 
[01:12:00]  We're not talking about that.  Shut your mouth.  And first of all, there's no defense in anything.  You can't defend something by putting the blame on something else for something completely different.  That isn't defending what Jimmy was bringing up.  Right.  Yeah.  All right, Tom.  That's a nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, you know?  Tom.  Hey, you did that.  Well, you did this.  Right. 
[01:12:30]  Tom, we're moving on to other things, but how's your health?  All right?  Yeah, how you doing?  I'm hanging in there.  God, you sound like E-Rock.  You're trying to get some cinnamon down.  You should come in and we do the cinnamon thing with you.  Yeah.  With one granule.  A cinnamon tic-tac.  You didn't sound too good there when you said you were doing all right.  What was that?  You didn't sound too good or too well when you said, I'm doing all right. 
[01:13:00]  Well, for me, I'm doing all right.  For you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's all relative.  I'm not doing a marathon, but, you know.  But, you know, in your world, you didn't think you were going to ever see snow again.  And look at the good news.  There's snow all over the place for you, Tom.  Yeah.  I just love it.  All right, sir.  Hang in there and happy holidays, all right?  You too.  Have a great vacation, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  There's Tom.  It's not till next week. 
[01:13:30]  Well, we're feeling it, though.  Hey, New Jersey officially bans the death penalty.  That went through.  What happened?  Well, congratulations.  Thank God, because they cleaned up every murderer and rapist in Jersey.  That's wonderful.  So you could just do away with the death penalty.  I don't understand why people wouldn't want the death penalty.  I just don't get it.  And it says in the news story, this spares eight lives.  They haven't used the death penalty in New Jersey since. 
[01:14:00]  I know.  I don't even know.  Maybe we could get a date.  They are anyone.  I think we...  It was in the 50s or something.  Maybe 60s, yeah.  They haven't killed anybody in Jersey in so long, so this is just a technicality that  they officially got rid of it.  I have to argue against it.  I'm kind of glad they banned it.  1963!  63.  Why is that?  I don't think it's cruel or unusual.  I think it's justified.  I just think that poor people are more likely to get it because they cannot afford certain DNA.  The legal system is great, but in something like that, it's not fair enough. 
[01:14:30]  You can get a public defender.  You're not going to guarantee the same quality of legal defense.  It's like when your life is on the line, you should be guaranteed the best quality of legal defense.  Well, then continue with that same thinking with life in prison without parole.  Do you think that people that are wealthy get off of that?  Yes.  Sure.  So let's do away with that.  No, no, no.  Because then the impoverished and poor people won't be able to have a good defense. 
[01:15:00]  So how far back do we have to go?  Just let everyone go?  Only the finality of the one step because the only thing that's undoable is killing somebody.  I mean, look, nobody wants 15 years of their life wasted, but it's not undoable as new evidence can always surface or whatever.  Or things like when you look at the prosecutor, like that piece of garbage, Nifong, whatever it was, Nifong, you were a new case.  When you look at other things like that, you know, I don't trust it enough.  And to me, the death penalty, the finality of it is undoable.  And I don't trust the legal system to be perfect enough to make sure that the guilty are the only ones getting it. 
[01:15:30]  That's all it is.  That's a good point.  It's the finality.  I like Jimmy's point on that one.  I think, though, instead of doing away with the death penalty, we ought to figure out a way to do more to find out the guilt or innocence of people.  I mean, there is DNA now.  A lot of people were falsely imprisoned.  And I wouldn't doubt falsely, not falsely killed.  They were absolutely killed. 
[01:16:00]  But innocent people were put to death.  But nowadays, with DNA testing, a lot of people are being freed.  And I think they're not being prosecuted as much because DNA gets them off the hook or puts them behind bars.  And it's pretty much a sure thing.  If it was a perfect science, like if it was guaranteed that only the people who committed, I mean, I'd be all for a death penalty by being drawn and courted.  I don't think it's unjustified at all.  Yeah.  I just don't like the fact that if you don't make money in this country, that literally this is the freest country in the world. 
[01:16:30]  And you can be killed by the state for something you didn't do.  What about these clear-cut crimes that they got the guy red-handed on the scene with the gun, you know, premeditated murder?  What about things like that where it's an absolute that he did it?  I agree with you.  But here's what the legal system, everyone they put to death, they look at as that absolute.  Like the legal system never said, well, this one's kind of iffy, but let's kill him anyway. 
[01:17:00]  But they've always convinced themselves that they're doing the absolute.  Like, well, we have X amount of appeals.  But literally, if you bring evidence three days late beyond where the time cutoff was, they can reject it.  And they won't admit your evidence.  And like when your life is on the line, they should be forced to admit your evidence.  Well, yeah, that should be changed.  That's my thing.  But of course, I agree with you emotionally.  Clear-cut K, of course.  But to me, that's the only – most of them are not like that clear-cut.  Like, you know, the video of a guy raping and killing a woman?  You know, it's just not that clear-cut. 
[01:17:30]  I think it's stupid to even argue it because they haven't even done anything with this death penalty since 1963.  The whole area is pretty liberal as far as that goes.  I guess the point I was trying to make, it's like this is just dumb because they weren't going to kill people even though they had the death penalty.  They made it perfectly clear that in Jersey they weren't going to kill anybody anymore.  So this is just a technicality.  I mean, the last person put to death was 1963.  I remember that's 44 years ago.  Well, there's executions going on. 
[01:18:00]  Kennedy was president the last time they put someone to death.  So this is just stupid.  Just get rid of the death penalty across the country because for the most part they don't do it anymore.  Yeah.  Well, Texas is hanging in there.  But barely.  Even they have slowed way down.  Yeah.  Way down.  Way down.  Speaking of prison, we've got a great story here in New York.  Actually, is this Jersey?  Where is this?  Oh, in Union County.  Union County?  Yeah.  We had a prison break.  I love prison break stories. 
[01:18:30]  Ever since I was a kid, I would get off on these prison break things.  Yeah.  Like all the movies like Alcatraz and Shawshank.  Yep.  I love when guys get out of prison.  A good prison break movie.  I love it.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  I guess because it takes so much to figure out how to do this.  It's making dummies and making guns out of soap.  Yeah.  And taking a spoon and just carving away at the mortar for 10 straight years.  The patience you have to have. 
[01:19:00]  When you look at a prison, especially day one,  just imagine the horror of those bars sliding and locking,  and you're in there, and then you look around and go,  there's no way out of here.  But people figure it out every once in a while.  But people actually figure it out and get out.  And that does amaze me.  There's guards.  There's metal bars.  There's cement walls.  And, man, there's some dedication there to getting the hell out.  If you ever get out to San Francisco, go to Alcatraz. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  As far as tourist traps go.  And the manhole.  It's a great bar.  And the manhole.  Well, sure.  Alcatraz we went to last time I was out there.  And I went.  It's amazing.  Like, most tourist things suck.  Let's be honest.  I don't care what city you live in.  We all have them.  We have this dumb Empire State Building.  I haven't been there since I was 12.  Did they rename it that?  Yeah, the dumb Empire State Building.  It's just a waste of time.  It really is.  You wait online.  Oh, wow.  We're up high.  Woo.  And then you buy a little Empire State Building little statuette. 
[01:20:00]  Who cares?  Yeah.  But Alcatraz, man, it's the real deal.  You take a little ferry out there.  Just the ferry ride is scenic and creepy.  And then you get on the island.  And you check out this place.  And you check out how they escaped.  It's just amazing.  Yeah.  And do the audio thing.  You know, splurge the extra five or six bucks for the little audio thing.  So they describe everything for you.  Just an amazing, amazing tourist thing to do.  Well, the audio tour is so good because you can pause it where you want to. 
[01:20:30]  Like, I wanted to go into the yard.  Because there were some cool scenes from Escape from Alcatraz and Clint Eastwood in English shot in the yard.  Yeah.  So we went out to the yard and just sat on the steps.  And I got my picture taken where Clint in English sat.  And it was great.  And then we go back in and you press play again.  And then you're right back on the audio tour.  And it's done by guards that worked there.  It's done by ex-convicts that were there.  They're all really old men.  But then you see the cell where Frank Morris and I think the Anglin brothers were their names where they put the dummy heads.  And it was really cool. 
[01:21:00]  I really wanted the inside tour of that place.  Right now.  As you're going back to the ferry, you kind of see these other, like, areas.  And some of them are, like, it's been a while, though.  But I think there was a gift shop just before you got back on the little bird.  A gift shop.  Of course.  That just makes me a flash.  Of course.  But you see the gift shop.  And then there's some ropes that lead to these areas.  And they're kind of, like, just, like, you know, like tunnels and stuff.  Off limits.  Because the whole thing was built on a rock.  Yeah.  So they're digging tunnels in this thing for offices and whatever.  I want to take that tour. 
[01:21:30]  Or they don't take the people.  My girlfriend's mother one time won some kind of a thing.  I don't know how she did it.  But she got to stay the night on Alcatraz.  And what they do is you got to see the places that the regular tours weren't allowed to go.  A lot of them are for safety.  They're just little narrow step areas.  Yeah.  You know, some of them are just burnt out.  But there's tiny little tunnels that lead to somewhere.  I want to know where they lead to.  But anyway, so we had a prison break here in Jersey, Union County.  These guys got out.  And I think this is cool as hell.  The news, of course, has to turn into a fear-mongering thing. 
[01:22:00]  Because, you know, the first...  That guy is a murderer.  Yeah, but what is he going to do?  I don't know.  But it kind of scares me.  What?  He's going to come to Long Island and take you out?  I'm prepared.  This is...  Watch my podcast.  Lazlo.com.  Lazlo.com.  Yes.  If you have 20 minutes.  Yes.  In this day and age, 20 minutes online is like watching, you know, the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  20 minutes that could save your life. 
[01:22:30]  And also proves my point that you're more insane than I am.  All right.  Enough about me.  The real insane one is sitting across from me.  Okay.  Here's the prison break story.  These two should be in jail.  In fact, they were in the Union County Jail until Saturday.  Oh, be an Anthony.  When 32-year-old Otis Plunt and 20-year-old Jose Espinosa escaped.  Authorities say using that wire and a pipe valve, they found a weakness in the cinder block jail.  They chiseled away the mortar. 
[01:23:00]  And then, when they had the opportunity, they pulled the block out and also smashed it.  Look how they fooled the guards, using bedsheets to make it look like they were in their cells.  The men were housed right next to each other.  First, they removed the block between them.  It was Espinosa's cell that touched the outside wall, allowing them to squeeze through about 18 inches to freedom.  Wait, so this outside wall, they got through that, and then there's no barbed wire fence or any of that?  That was it?  Yeah.  Oh, they climbed over that too? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, they had to make a big drop down, like 15 feet.  Wow.  To jump over.  Or, they got on some kind of a roof and then jumped from there over the barbed wire to the ground.  And, you know, lucky for them, they didn't bust a leg.  Well, they might have a busted leg or something, right?  No, well, they jumped down, then they climbed barbed wire.  Oh, okay.  The razor barbed wire is brutal, but, I mean, you're fighting for your life.  Because these guys are probably going away for 25 years.  Yeah.  You know, that's a good old thing.  That's more than that.  But they smashed the cinder block that they were able to remove. 
[01:24:00]  No one noticed banging in the middle of the night?  I know, that's another thing.  What are you just tap, tap, slowly?  Wait for the thunderstorm, like Shawshank.  Oh, yeah, right?  A little more to the story.  The escape, much like in a movie, in this one, is a real cliffhanger.  Because tonight, both men are on the loose so far, making a clean break.  I would say to the public that these people are considered dangerous.  Espinosa was responsible for killing someone and waiting to be sentenced to at least 17 years. 
[01:24:30]  And Blunt was in, awaiting trial for armed robbery.  Of course, people who live around the jail are afraid.  Jekinda Glass was once an inmate in the jail.  He's shocked the facility was compromised.  I don't understand.  And I've been in there before, so, you know, I know how the security is in there.  He's been in there before, eh?  That's great.  He didn't go very far.  I don't think the residents should be scared, though.  I mean, if you're breaking out of jail, the last thing you want to do is go on a raping, you know, pillage, rampage, whatever. 
[01:25:00]  You're not going to look for apartments behind the jail.  Right, right.  I don't know.  That guy did.  He's been in there before.  He didn't get too far.  I got a job at the local grocery store.  Yeah.  Those guys who get caught, you can't escape from jail for long in this day and age.  The way information is...  No, why?  Because you've got to go back to family and friends.  That's what gets you every time.  Yep.  That does.  They always wind up going back to family and friends because... 
[01:25:30]  And they have nowhere else to go.  They go back to the neighborhood, but they kind of maybe find, like, I don't know, an apartment  close to family and friends because that's all they know.  And what else are they going to do?  They can't get a job.  No.  They need money.  You've got to eat.  You know, it's easy to think you could just run, but you've got to stop and eat.  You've got to go to the bathroom.  You've got to do things that are going to expose you to other people.  Well, how much time were they up for?  Like, 17 years or something?  17 years at least, he said.  You've got to give it a shot. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, give it a shot.  What the hell?  You know, you've got to follow the river down and hope it leads to something cool.  And unlike another story that popped up, that wonderful gentleman that he was serving  290 days.  270, I think.  270 days.  Yeah, not mad.  I thought it was 290 days on a pot charge.  Let's call it less than a year.  Nine months.  Nine months.  About nine months.  On a pot charge.  And they were transporting him in a van.  They decide to stop to get a tire repaired. 
[01:26:30]  They get out of the van, the guards, leave the keys in the van.  And this guy with 270 days on his stint, I guess couldn't resist.  If you had five days left, you'd have to try to escape when they leave the keys in the  van like that.  He had a month served already, too.  Yeah, he had a month served, and he took off in the van, and now he faces felony escape 
[01:27:00]  charges.  Oh, what an idiot.  Which could land him in jail for several years.  He had 290 days.  70 days.  He bought an extra year by doing that, I bet you.  You think one year?  Yeah, because he didn't break out of the facility.  It wasn't a violent thing.  I mean, he just drove the van away.  He could say it was a joke.  Look, I was goofing.  The guy left the keys in.  How many months do you think they'll give him for that?  A year or less?  Two years, maybe he'll be out in the...  That's dumb.  Maybe as an embarrassment to the directions guys or the sheriffs, whoever was escorting 
[01:27:30]  him.  I think if you're in jail and you got less than a year, that's when you just go into,  I got less than a year.  Oh, my God.  I see the van.  I see the keys in it.  Yeah, you're short.  The van's cranking out Zeppelin.  It's calling me, but I got it.  I'd be like, hey, you left the keys in here, because then you've got the same problem.  Now he escaped, but where does he go?  Yeah.  That's how you're going.  It's really not worth the risk at that point. 
[01:28:00]  I think if you're doing a bunch of years, then of course you go for it.  They won't kick up much fuss for an old codger like me.  So where is this guy?  I don't know.  Did they catch him?  Not yet, right?  Let's see.  He's blending in with that Department of Corrections van and the thing that was pulling behind him.  Yeah, the trailer was pulling behind him in his orange jumpsuit.  He's like those guys in the jerk that drove away and pulled the church behind them.  There's no way you're getting away for long, you idiot.  Let's go to Stryker here from Whack Bag. 
[01:28:30]  Stryker, what's up?  Yeah, morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I'm just curious.  How horrible are those Union County guards that they fell for the old bed sheet routine?  Yeah, I wanted to see the visual on that, because the news woman there said these bed sheets fooled them.  How?  Yeah.  Well, they must have done.  You ever walk into the bedroom and you think your chick is asleep in bed or something,  and it's just the sheets piled up with a blanket or another man?  Wow. 
[01:29:00]  Usually you walk in and if the sheets are piled up, you walk over there and realize, no, no one's in here.  All right.  And then Frankie from Jersey.  Frankie.  Yo, guys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Thanks, Frankie.  Did they talk about what they covered the holes in the wall with when they were working on this project?  Yes, nudie pictures.  They tore centerfolds out, and now they're banned from bringing them into jail.  Oh, these guys ruined it for everybody.  Wow.  That's going to be a bunch of P.O. to convicts. 
[01:29:30]  They can't be banning nudie photos from jails.  Well, Union County is right now.  Oh, boy.  You know, they'll get the guys back.  Keep them calm.  Let them have whatever the hell they want.  Let them have their nudie magazines.  Neither of these guys looked like they were doing the accounting for the warden, either.  I'll tell you that much.  They were like, it's right out of Shawshank Redemption.  It's like, well, maybe not right out of Shawshank.  Like, I don't think either of these guys are doing the books or, you know, getting beers for their buddies to do some rooftop work. 
[01:30:00]  There were a few differences.  Yeah.  Just a couple of differences.  Yeah.  In Shawshank, what happened?  What did he say to the warden that got him?  Like, I'll never tell anybody what you've been doing with the...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Was he supposed to get out or something, and then the warden screwed him?  It was a kid, like a rock and roll type kid, came into the prison and had spoken to some guy that fessed up to the crime. 
[01:30:30]  Right.  To the killing of the wife that Tim Robbins was in for.  And then he asked the warden about it, and he said, you know, if I get out or if this pans out, you don't have to worry.  I won't say anything about what's been going on here.  Oh, really?  In the hole?  And he shouldn't have said that.  No, he probably shouldn't have acknowledged the fact that he was doing anything illegal ever.  I've got to watch that movie again.  I watched it so many times. 
[01:31:00]  I've watched it.  Every time it's on, you just leave it on.  Sure.  It's a great movie.  Phones are lit, but we've got to take a break here.  Travis is screening them.  Or Bon Jovi is today, right?  Or young Sylvester Stallone.  Who is that in there?  Paul, Delaware, what's up?  Hey, I did that audio tour at Alcatraz, and they have those solitary booths, and they played the music coming over from San Francisco.  And on that summer night, you could hear it. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  That really freaked me out.  These guys are just sitting there by themselves, and they've got to listen to that.  Yeah, I pointed that out a few times.  What you don't realize when you go to Alcatraz with a Z, it was pointed out to me.  I know that.  I wasn't going to say that.  You could see the mainland, and you could also see a yacht club, which was there even back in the day when the prisoners were on the island.  And yeah, they said that that's what drove them nuts, was hearing couples, especially couples having a good time.  You hear the nice music playing.  It's a nice summer night. 
[01:32:00]  The breeze would bring over the audio a little better, and that would drive them nuts.  People just enjoying themselves on a summer night.  They played that music on that tour, and I'm like, I've got to get out of here.  This was crazy.  Imagine that.  You're behind bars, and then in the distance.  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in, and you've got the stock market beat.  I think I hear somebody talking.  The man worthwhile is the man who can smile when his shorts are too tight in the seat. 
[01:32:30]  Okay, Pookie.  All right, lockdown.  Oh, no, but Pookie's christening the boat.  Let's go to Justin in Jersey.  Justin.  Hey.  Hey.  The warden was getting uptight about getting dropped out by, what's his name? 
[01:33:00]  Tim Robbins, and Robbins called him and said he was being obtuse.  Obtuse.  Oh, remember that?  Yeah.  He threw him in a hole for the month, and then after a month, he went back to him again,  and he said, I think, you know, you're going to be good and everything, and Robbins is  laying on the floor, and he goes, give him another month.  Am I being obtuse about this now?  Yeah.  What a punk.  What is obtuse?  What is obtuse?  Obtuse.  What does obtuse mean?  It's being difficult.  He's being, he's not listening to Tim Robbins' side of the whole thing. 
[01:33:30]  What does it mean?  What does it mean?  Come on, come on, come on.  Yes.  Anthony's, it means narrow-minded.  Yes.  To be.  Very good.  All right, Justin.  Hey, you guys have a great vacay, man.  All right?  Punch it out.  Thanks, Justin.  Well, we're, you know, a few days away still, but we're starting to feel it.  Jeez, don't, everyone keeps saying that.  It just makes the week go longer.  Maybe it's very obvious to everybody that we're kind of feeling that we really need to get out  of here for a week.  Yeah, perhaps.  This is a very tired show at this point.  Yes, Dan.  They're kind of saying, why don't you hit the showers? 
[01:34:00]  Hey, what is the best thing you did on vacation?  Don't be obtuse.  Like I say, Alcatraz was right up there.  I went to the Grand Canyon.  Some of that stuff was amazing.  That's pretty good.  But, I mean, what I did at the Grand Canyon, most people don't do, and you're not supposed  to do.  They warn you that you really shouldn't hike down in the Colorado River and back in one  day.  No.  And the legendary story, me and my brother actually hiking out at night.  It was really scary and really stupid.  You should take the donkeys down like the Brady Bunch did, and then watch Mr. Brady 
[01:34:30]  do some work on one of the donkeys.  Now, boys, I learned this on a bachelor party in Mexico City.  I passed those stupid donkeys on the way down, and I told you, a forest ranger or whatever  goes, oh, those New Yorkers.  Well, we were jumping ahead.  And, you know, because what is it called?  What is it called when the path goes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth?  Zig-zaggy. 
[01:35:00]  Zig-zaggy.  It's zig-zaggy, but there's a name for it, switchback or something like that.  Oh, switchback.  And the donkeys were in our way, so me and my brother jumped down to the next part of  the trail.  Oh, right.  Not that big of a deal.  Like, you're just kind of sliding down maybe 10 feet or something.  Mm-hmm.  Not dangerous at all.  And all of a sudden, the forest ranger goes, hey, to me and my brother.  And we're like, yeah.  He goes, where are you boys from?  And we're like, ah, we're in New York, from New York.  He goes, ah, those New Yorkers, always in a hurry.  And he goes-  I said, Arizona.  Huh?  Now what?  Yeah.  And he goes, you know, you could get a ticket for what you just did. 
[01:35:30]  And we're like, what do we do?  And he said something like causing erosion.  Yeah.  And I'm like, the whole reason we're here is because of erosion.  This whole place is erosion.  That's what I said to the guy.  I'm like, you're kidding me, right?  This is the reason we're here, because of this big hole that's been eroding for a couple  hundred years.  And yeah, we were in a hurry.  We wanted to get past the donkeys, get down to the Colorado River and back, put our little  footsies in the river and then go right back up. 
[01:36:00]  When you say, where do you live?  You should have said, at the bottom of the canyon.  Right.  We have some dinty more on the stove.  Yeah.  I don't have time for you and your dumb donkeys.  I got to get down there.  See Mr. Hanalee with his camera following Cindy and Bobby.  Or was he the Hawaiian man?  He was the Hawaiian guy.  Whatever he was.  No, you need the little engine kid that you bring beans in the flashlight.  Yeah, that's what they did.  Bobby.  What was the greatest thing you did on vacation, Anthony, as far as tourist traps go? 
[01:36:30]  Tourist traps?  I think the greatest thing I did, and the thing that sticks out in my mind the most, and I  don't think it was as fun at the time, but now it was, I look back fondly as a big adventure,  was driving cross country with my father, his girlfriend, my brother, and me in a pinto.  Wow.  Wow.  But we stopped at Mount Rushmore, so I got to see that.  Is that cool?  The Badlands.  Is it as big as it looks, or is it?  Yeah, it's just huge. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  It's very majestic.  It's all lit up.  It was at night.  It looks very cool.  Did that hold your hand and walk you around, son, and show your stuff?  No.  How old were you?  I was probably 12.  Oh, cool.  It's a little 12 year, and then, of course, he had to have beer with him the whole time,  and the cooler was sweating, because it was hot in certain areas that we were driving through,  so the cooler was sweating, and I woke up completely soaking wet one day, and me and 
[01:37:30]  Joe were sleeping in the back of a pinto.  It was awful, and my father's got his beer, and he's drinking the entire way.  Like, just did not stop drinking the whole way, and then any time a car would pull up  kind of close next to him, I'd notice he'd put his hand down a little bit, because he  had his .357 right there under one of his legs.  You see where I get it?  He was a bit paranoid like the son, huh?  Well, you know, some nut's going to pull up next to him?  Yeah. 
[01:38:00]  Protecting his, what's his?  His family.  Beer.  His beer.  Yeah.  Take the kids, but leave the beer, damn it.  Because it was a clever ruse, like the Banditos, you know, even though they saw a pinto, they  knew there must be gold in that pinto.  That's right.  You're insane.  The Kumias are insane.  The Kumias are insane!  Yes!  The biggest bust ever.  I was driving from Arizona to LA when we had our time off, just wandering America. 
[01:38:30]  A lot of people know that by now.  And I saw a sign for the Joshua Tree Park or whatever it's called.  And it's Joshua Tree from U2, if you've seen the cover.  I've been there.  And I hear it's amazing, right?  Or is it?  It's pretty cool.  It's just the desert.  You know, you're in the desert.  I'm on the main highway from Arizona to LA, whatever it's called.  And all of a sudden, it says...  66?  I don't know.  The old Route 66.  No, it was the main freaking track.  That's fun.  And all of a sudden, it says like 200 miles to Joshua Tree Park. 
[01:39:00]  And I'm on my way to LA.  I'm like, this is perfect.  I'm a U2 fan.  I want to check this out.  So I...  100 miles.  80 miles.  50 miles.  40 miles.  10 miles.  Next exit.  Just a bunch of Joshua Trees.  No, no.  Here's the problem.  I never saw the Joshua Tree.  Because I get off where the exit is for the Joshua Tree Park, and I get into the actual  park, and then there's a sign, you know, bear with me, because I don't remember anymore,  but it was something like, Joshua Tree, you know, the actual trees are 250 miles down 
[01:39:30]  this one lane.  Oh, my God.  250 miles?  Something like...  Something ridiculous.  Let's just put...  The Joshua Tree outside should have told you.  Right.  And then I stopped, and I asked, is there any hotels?  Because at this point, there's no way I'm going to check out the trees and get back  on the highway to get to L.A., and I started driving and driving, and finally I said,  this is not going to happen.  This is a waste of effing time.  So I never got to see the trees.  What are they?  What are you looking...  Just look at trees?  What are Joshua Trees?  Yeah, it's just a Joshua Tree.  It's this bent-looking tree that looks like a post-nuclear tree. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  It just looks odd.  I'd be like, I had to go in there with a gas can and a match.  That'd be fun.  They're going to burn them.  They're basically overgrown, like, sticker bushes or something, but, you know, you two made  them famous by, you know, naming their album Joshua Tree and all that.  People are saying, and I've been there too, Wall Drug, the famous Wall Drug.  I think it's in South Dakota.  And there is just signs a thousand miles before you get there. 
[01:40:30]  Right.  A thousand miles to Wall Drug, and then 900 miles, 850 miles, and you get there, and  it's this big tourist trappy mall trying to look like the Old West thing.  Yeah.  It was like the place that, in the Vacation movie.  Right.  The second one, I think.  Maybe the first one.  I don't know.  Where he was wearing the cowboy hat.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  And got in the gunfight with the guy.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no.  You're supposed to do this. 
[01:41:00]  Two things coming in.  After Mount Rushmore trip, did Aunt, Dad, and Brother shower together?  Uh, no.  Actually, no, we didn't.  And Steven S. from Bayshore asked me if I went all the way down to the Colorado River  at the Grand Canyon to wash out my sweatpants.  Oh, your sweatpants.  Memories, uh, they certainly got them.  Let's go to break.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:41:30]  Hey, good morning.  Opie and Anthony with you.  Hello.  I'm really tired today.  I think it was because I was lugging that 100-pound Christmas tree around last night.  This holiday sucks.  It's just more hassles than it's worth.  Then I realized my, uh, did I say this earlier?  The stand that I've been using for the last few years is too small.  So then I'm shoving the trunk of this tree in this stand trying to make it fit. 
[01:42:00]  And then the whole thing toppled over?  I guess I did say that earlier.  So now I gotta go find a bigger stand.  It's just one thing after another.  I don't believe this.  What happened?  This is not true.  What happened?  How is Pam Anderson in a non-working marriage?  I find that hard to believe.  Uh, two months ago they got married to Rick, uh, Solomon.  The large, uh, genital gentleman who, uh, was in the Parrot Hilt video.  Yes. 
[01:42:30]  And I find it hard to believe that she married this guy.  Obviously they were in love.  They knew each other.  And now they're getting divorced.  I mean, how, how do you think she's still hot?  No.  When are they going to finally say she's used to be hot?  For a woman who are aged.  They kind of are now.  They're saying the aged, the aging ex-Baywatch star is how they're, uh, what they're calling her these days.  They should just say used to be hot Pam Anderson.  I mean, she's 40.  For 40, she's fantastic.  She's 40? 
[01:43:00]  No, no, she's not fantastic.  You're getting, you're getting, uh, confused because of the big boob job.  No, I don't like big boob job.  You take the big boob job away.  I don't think she's fantastic, Jimmy.  I think she's far from it at this point.  To me, I actually, I like the lower body and the face.  The big breasts don't do it for me.  I'm not a fan of giant, um, implants at all.  I prefer B cups or natural heavy teardrop C's, but I don't need, I'll take A cups over big implants.  She was such a natural beauty when she first hit the scene.  And, uh, she just continues to wreck herself with, uh, probably a little, little surgery here and there. 
[01:43:30]  You want to, you want to see a little surgery here and there.  There's a picture of Michael Jackson in the paper today.  Oh, wow.  I don't know what's going on.  And he's got new bandages, one, uh, where your mustache would be.  And where's the other one on his chin?  Yeah, like, it's all around his mouth.  Like, like they taped his mouth on.  Like, at some point his mouth fell off.  He is.  He probably left it on a youngster.  Creep.  He's just, yeah, he's just a creep.  No way around that one, man. 
[01:44:00]  He is just a creep.  Look at that.  I'm sure you can find it, uh, for yourself.  We'll, we'll link this photo up on onaradio.com later today, but, uh.  How do your children take you seriously?  When you're wearing a hat and a black scarf thing and the big, why don't you stop making an ass out of yourself already?  I don't know how he, uh.  Well, he has kids that look completely white.  Well, because he's completely white.  Yeah, now he is.  But his, his DNA, he still has that young black man that he was. 
[01:44:30]  Well, you got the, the egg from a white girl.  So that'll knock it down a little bit.  Look at our own Sam.  This is.  Look at our own Sam.  You're talking blonde hair.  You know.  Yeah, our own Sam.  Well, that's true.  So.  Sam could be one of Michael Jackson's kids.  Oh, I believe those kids are his.  I don't believe.  Do you?  I don't believe he did it the old fashioned way, but.  Yeah, I think he's.  Those kids are his.  Stopped at him.  Those kids are his, man.  In my opinion.  I think he adopted.  He just sucks.  And he's got his kids brainwashed. 
[01:45:00]  You think maybe.  Imagine it's just a goof.  Like he's just effing with everybody.  Oh, and if he took those bandages off and everything.  All that stuff.  Imagine he's just effing with everybody.  And that he's really normal.  He's by himself.  That's what his dopey friends say.  That he is normal?  Yeah.  But he's not.  No, he hangs out with kids.  Bounce on my lap.  He's a creep.  He doesn't hang out with kids anymore.  Of course he does.  He just isn't probably brought in.  I don't believe that.  The least won't allow it.  Why?  He was acquitted. 
[01:45:30]  Of course he can.  You see the pictures of Neverland Ranch?  Mm-mm.  Where he used to live and all?  What?  Gone to hell.  It's breaking down?  Weeds and overgrown stuff all over the place.  They show, I forgot what website, but they show like a before and after.  Because he hasn't been there.  I mean, he just bailed.  Yeah, he just abandoned the joint.  He bailed on that place and they haven't kept it up whatsoever and it's just a mess now.  It was expensive, right, Dubkeep?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.

[01:48:30]  of that i was it was that really was a depressing thing to listen yeah oh really because i  associated it with the show so like i remember the holidays around a ding but i was like oh i can't  listen to it not listen to it no yeah same weird how you associate the only radio i could listen to 
[01:49:00]  i think i've said this was the art bell show because it was so different with beningo on sports i could  never listen to any radio that was like this i don't think i listened to anything miserable as far  as the radio went i watched the i-man oh i couldn't no i watched him on uh msnbc back in the day  i i was glued to a video game screen whatever it was whatever i was playing that month yeah hey uh  we're trying something different this holiday season we're trying to play the uh the beep game  with these fine christmas songs that everyone knows and loves and here's sam's first attempt 
[01:49:30]  at the beep game with uh rudolph the red nose ring okay all right give it a sin song give it a minute  give it a little time to kind of develop trust me on this okay okay and then tell us what you think  here it is uh the beep game with uh very famous holiday songs you know dasher and dancer and printer  and fixin comet and cupid and donner and blitzen but do you recall the most famous 
[01:50:00]  of all rudolph the red nose had a very shiny  and if you ever saw it you would even say it close  i love the other  is to laugh and call him name  they never let poor rudolph join in any 
[01:50:30]  game then one foggy christmas eve santa came to say  that's not bad 
[01:51:00]  that's not well that's such an innocent song i'm gonna say bit on bit on bit on we have a go  we're gonna attempt a few more okay there you go the first one in the uh in the beep game with  christmas songs and then of course we'll go to break catch up a little bit with uh the german guy  performing yeah that's chicken oh no oh christmas tree by uh farting into a recorder the video is 
[01:51:30]  hilarious did we uh did we post the video on onaradio.com oh i hope we did because the video is uh way funnier  than the audio although the audio is pretty pretty good pretty impressive the guy's got a talent here  he uh has this uh recorder and he's uh he's uh he's playing it uh from from the wrong end yep  and not of the instrument  mm-hmm  mm-hmm 
[01:52:00]  yeah you try to do that not as easy as it sounds by the way every time we do the beep game uh 
[01:52:30]  people bring up jimmy kimmel and they try to defend jimmy kimmel and blah blah blah  putting beeps and unnecessary beeps into audio is a really really old radio bit yeah  we can't take credit for it kimmel cannot take credit for it although he obviously made it  with his tv show but jimmy kimmel comes from the world of radio a lot of the stuff but not a lot  some of the stuff he does on his show and it's a good show i like jimmy kimmel i do watch the jimmy 
[01:53:00]  kimmel show uh he he got from radio and just brought it to tv yeah so i mean because people  are like oh you're ripping off jimmy kimmel no no this is one of these things that radio guys have  been doing for the longest time throwing a little beep here or there to make it uh sound a little  different all right so there you go we're acknowledging that it the jimmy kimmel angle  so relax phone number 877-212-ONA we'll continue it's opian anthony 
[01:53:30]  rock and roll getting ready to play what did we learn on the opian anthony show phone number 877-212-ONA  don't forget about onaradio.com some of the links that were of the visual nature will be up there for  you guys so you don't have to search around for all these things we talk about they're all at one  place for you and let's not forget about anthony's video podcast oh yes laszlo.com if you want to sit 
[01:54:00]  through 20 minutes of boredom hey it's fantastic it tells people about home invasions and uh how to  keep them from happening to you actually you should go see the video podcast so some of the attention  will be off me and back where it belongs on you as far as being a psychopath oh well i don't think  anybody ever doubted the fact that i had my issues you're insane with um you're in certain things  saying i say well it sounds all reasonable and logical to me and i begged you i said 20 minutes is too 
[01:54:30]  long in this day and age 20 minutes no one wants to sit through 20 minutes when they're searching  around the internet it's just the uh premiere episode i made it uh very long all the rest of my  podcast will be five minutes long uh no longer but this one yeah it's 20 minutes um uh but it's  very educational uh does the camera move around at least or it's just um no no but there there's a tv  behind me and things uh flash up on the tv screen oh great that gives you something i've got that's 
[01:55:00]  wonderful what's that you couldn't put it in parts oh i could have oh i could have because uh i don't  i think 20 minutes is watchable but sometimes it takes too long to load yeah well uh laszlo did a good  job of compressing it down and uh and uh laszlo's fantastic it's up on laszlo.com all right and  what's the next podcast gonna be about um i think uh i might have to do one about uh the holidays or  uh about um my uh trip to colorado i might do the next one from colorado you should do my hotel room 
[01:55:30]  do a podcast on how you talk your uh girlfriend into uh or convincing her that you need to stay in a  hotel while she hangs out with her family yeah that yeah people want to know the answer to that  how you got that one done well it's just uh the way things go and there's a man and he put down his  foot she said look honey i'd like to do this and he said you know what i'm glad you'd like to do that 
[01:56:00]  but here's what we're doing wow wow i'm a man i'm a tough guy of course you are you pull out the  credit card and you said you want to fly or do you want to walk that's the way i handle my broad and  that's the way he handles his broad you should follow suit eric you have you're just lucky you're  a cuckold anthony lays down the law as he should all right uh we got a couple couple kids in trouble  yeah we got a kid a kindergartner this was a few days ago we're gonna blow it off but then there's 
[01:56:30]  another story today so we'll uh we'll put it all together in a nice quick little segment here  i need a little package a little package uh kindergarten may be expelled for bomb threat  bomb threat bomb threat at school a kindergartner accused of making a bomb threat may be expelled  his parents are shocked but despite the student's young age authorities say  his choice of words will not be tolerated we have to do that nowadays we don't have a choice of whether 
[01:57:00]  somebody really means something or not we have to take it seriously and if we didn't do that this  week it's a kindergartner next week it's a fourth grader the following week it's a high school  student and god forbid one of them actually do what they say they would do hmm um it's kindergarten  it's yeah if you expel them it's kind of like doesn't that just make them want to come back and  kill everybody yeah i don't stop with the slippery slope and stop saying tolerate i the word tolerance  and tolerate i'm tired of i'm sick of it tolerated tolerance uh holy s and i just watched your home 
[01:57:30]  safety video oh i think every home owner should be required to watch it before signing the loan  paper it's very informative good job and see and someone's saying is it laszlo.com that's not working  it's laszlo with a w at the end that's why sir yes all right here's more on the kindergartner  the six-year-old was overheard talking about putting a bomb in a classmate's backpack 
[01:58:00]  at least marion elementary dirt at east marion elementary during an after-school program  yesterday well administrators suspended the boy for two days and they called deputies to investigate  every indication we got there was no intent there was no bomb um but again once we're made aware of  these situations we've got to take it seriously no you don't no you got to be educated enough as  the principal of the school or the teacher to understand that it's just a kid being a kid 
[01:58:30]  and being stupid yeah that's all it is yeah to get what can't you distinguish that you have to be  able to distinguish that we're just we're just a nation of just little fags we really are we're just  fags so we've turned into complaining hypersense we just suck we used to do horrific things to our  teachers in school oh man yeah other in school and then the principal sorts it out like all right  you're an idiot and well you really need to not be at this school anymore they didn't decide that 
[01:59:00]  but now it's just like nope nope everyone gets suspended everyone so that was uh late last week and  we were going to blow that off but then there's a new one today with uh this one is a 10 year old  girl school officials say the fifth grader was brown bagging it and brought a piece of steak for  her lunch but she also brought a steak knife to cut it that's when deputies were called it happened  with deputies for a steak knife how about the principal brings her to the office and and tries to figure 
[01:59:30]  this out you don't need zero tolerance the deputies they're busy doing real stuff fighting real crime  don't call the deputies deputies were called it happened in the cafeteria at sunrise elementary  school the 10 year old used the knife to cut the meat but a couple of teachers took the utensil and  called the sheriff when deputies arrived they were unable to get the child's parents on the phone  so they arrested her and took her to the county's juvenile assessment center they what juvenile 
[02:00:00]  assessment center they what what is that they arrested her yes we're a balanced society  what healthy balanced society i missed something why did they arrest her because she took uh a steak  knife to school to probably cut the garbage meat they're passing over his lunch but she probably  need a chainsaw for well she brought her own steak so why did she oh yeah so she had a reason why she  had a steak knife on her how else are you supposed to cut steak instead of taking it and going look 
[02:00:30]  you can't have that right um we just over you know we're overreacting we're wash women all we do is  fan ourselves and yell help me help me that's what americans are a bunch of wash women who fan  themselves and yell help me help me help me can we stop it's just silly we're a bunch of idiots we're  dopes uh well the cops say it was uh the school's fault in this case by the way let's uh listen to  that school officials say it doesn't matter what the knife was being used for they say they had no 
[02:01:00]  choice anytime there's a weapon on campus yes we have to report that and we we aggressively report  that because we don't want to take any chances regardless but the sheriff's office says the extreme  measures in what some may say was a harmless incident had to do with school policy meantime the  student now faces a felony charge for the possession of a weapon on school property  and the principal suspended her for 10 days so here's the problem wait wait first what no it's 
[02:01:30]  going on it's steak knife because we're such we're so afraid of going after individuals and and being  accused of singling somebody out yep that there's no common sense used everybody knows that she did like  all right she shouldn't have done it but they have to treat her as if she had brought it there  to stab somebody when common sense dictates that she didn't because they're afraid of being accused of  being whether it's biased on some level by not suspending one student and suspending someone who actually 
[02:02:00]  brought it for violence they're trying to say that there was some trickery involved that the steak was  a clever ruse and that was the way the reason the reason she brought the steak knifing yeah  that's what i get out of that it that she didn't have intention of cutting up uh the steak  she was gonna do cut up some classmates no but that's what they're saying by doing all this by  felony charge suspension and all that they basically say no it wasn't about the cutting up a steak we  know we know better great scene in the wire on season four where the one girl is arguing with the 
[02:02:30]  other girl in class and the one girl pulls out like a razor just slashes the chick's face it was  really great violent cutting wow way to stop the discussion uh i apologize that's all right let's  go to brooklyn ace you're on the opian anthony show what's up brooklyn ace am i really cool listen it  first of all my sister went to that school in sunrise there are a bunch of retards down there  second of all um it my son can't turn around and point his thumb and forefinger at a classmate 
[02:03:00]  without them turning around and saying that he's gonna do something wow he's got a loaded finger  it's it's ridiculous they're stupid with the stuff that they're paying off from schools nowadays  yeah i don't know what to say to you man it just sounds ridiculous i would love to get a principal  or like a teacher on the phone to explain the other side of this because i i just don't see it  i don't see it i mean i thought their whole job was to try to figure this crap out you know who the  problem kids are everyone knows that but you can't do that single them out like show 
[02:03:30]  you do bring up a pretty good point with that jimmy you can't single people out anymore  because that's not tolerant and all inclusive yeah they all have to be uh under the same rules  you can't look at any one situation and judge it on its own merits everyone's got to go everyone's  so afraid of being like in making an individual decision and going you know what you're a bad kid  this kid's a problem they they just they can't do that because uh you know they're afraid of being 
[02:04:00]  singled out i just made my point twice sorry all right well let's boring we get it let's say  hi to tony in ohio i guess the the angle on this is to try to get some principals or teachers on the  phone and say what the f is going on explain this because it doesn't make sense uh go ahead tony  how's it going guys hey hey uh situation similar to this happened at my uh kid's school  friend of my daughter's he's a 3.8 student never been in trouble a day in his life  somebody had reported that they thought he was smoking weed they search his locker they don't 
[02:04:30]  find nothing they go out to his car start searching his car which of course is in the  student parking lot they find a box cutter in an apron in his trunk that's what he uses when he  goes to work after school they suspend him 10 days he has to go to juvie court and they're talking  you know about you know criminal charges and it ends up costing him a scholarship he was in line  for because he had never been in trouble and had great grades you know what i think maybe the  principals and the teachers have too much responsibility here and they're they're really 
[02:05:00]  effing up the future of some of these kids i mean this kid was i mean like i said a hard worker he  worked from after school till close nine ten o'clock at night right he said he goes i don't have time to  go home and get my stuff and they're like well sorry it's standard policy it's now in the hands of  the prosecutors once again yes somebody can't make a decision and intuitively as an adult and as a  responsible one quote unquote understand what that's used for because they can't see the difference  between that and kipling kinkle or somebody else that brings a weapon because they're dummies 
[02:05:30]  all right there you go uh let's go to rich in orlando rich what's up hey hey guys i am a uh  juvenile criminal defense attorney here in orlando um a lot i've talked to a lot of the i grew up  wrong island i'm from you know long beach and i i i i a lot of things that are crying here i look at  the kids going what like batteries that you know i got in florida batteries you have to stop in new  york with the battery in florida same carter name or you know our kid smack i literally had a kid  charged with robbery for grabbing another kid's hat and throwing it in a tree they called it a robbery a 
[02:06:00]  third-degree felony which will be five years in prison had you been an adult robbery and i i said to the  the people that the state the um the uh the state attorney's office here what what the hell what  they say basically it's if they don't do it here and they and it escalates they could get sued  because well this guy wasn't arrested well why wasn't he well why you know and this kid later on you  know shot somebody or something or not it's all preemptive like well if we look at now you know 
[02:06:30]  we charge this kid with battery a robbery now then maybe later on we can stop something from happening  well what i mean what happened to this simple common sense yeah there is none i deal with this  every day of my life i i got kids who are 12 years old charged with robbery when it would have been  you know us you know getting yelled at by our parents yeah well it's it's a different world it's  it's just uh carlin had a great statement about like politicians and we always say we want honest 
[02:07:00]  politicians but where are all these honest people supposed to be coming from he was talking about  the system and he said garbage in garbage out and it's accurate that's what we are just garbage  all right thank you sir let's go to paul and edison uh what's up paul hey uh this happened about nine  ten years ago my kid was in first grade and uh he was out on the playground and he found a stick in  the shape of a y there was a rubber band laying there he put the two together  show if any kids didn't shoot it put it in his backpack his teacher saw the whole thing she was 
[02:07:30]  school that one of the teachers aides went to the principal and told her that he had this slingshot  in his backpack they brought him into they brought him in they they uh took away his recess for a  week they called in my wife they said we were lucky that we didn't that they were they were going to  call the police and and file a complaint because they said he had a weapon in school even though his  teacher said he never showed anybody he put it right in his backpack he wanted to bring it home to show  his dad but they this this principal had this big thing she said he had a weapon in school 
[02:08:00]  we used to bring wrist rockets to school with the surgical tubing yeah the aluminum thing that went  over your whole wrist you pulled it back it thing would go through a tree and bring ball bearings with  you to shoot oh i wonder if some of these principals are on a power trip too no they're just insecure  frightened people yeah they're frightened well then get out of the business i agree get out of the  business then to uh superintendent of schools shortly thereafter they overreact to everything 
[02:08:30]  because they're so afraid of what happens um but it doesn't happen with eight-year-olds it happens with  high school students whoever knows the problem anyway and and kids are insane to begin with they  got all the hormones jumping around their bodies they're trying to figure out crap they're getting  in trouble for what they draw which is ridiculous with the cover of my notebooks when growing up through  my entire course of going to school we're covered with just stuff that would have gotten me thrown  out of school penis montage i would draw of course no i would uh i would draw a lot of war stuff yeah 
[02:09:00]  like like airplanes shooting people and having like the little people uh down on the ground getting  chewed up by the uh gunfire from the planes and they were like you know uh uh german aircraft nazi  aircraft and american tanks and it was all about death and destruction and people being bayoneted  things like that they would kick me out of school uh we got a teacher not brave enough to call or  maybe they can't get to a phone uh from indiana ryan writes the whole thing is zero tolerance the 
[02:09:30]  point is to avoid a conversation that gives excuses and outs for bringing weapons it's just a complete  weaponless zone as a teacher i even disagree most of us do we feel it's situation to situation is how  it should be handled yeah and i understand a weaponless zone like some kids don't have the  right to bring a knife and other kids don't but you know it's like a case like where someone brings  a steak and it's a little girl who's probably not gonna go out and stand people yeah you just know  let's go to mike in new york city mike yeah how you doing guys hey teacher love the show first time 
[02:10:00]  on cool thanks and you're a teacher yeah i'm a teacher here in new york and um the administrators  really blow this whole situation out of proportion what they do is they force the teachers to report  every little incident and if we don't then we face discipline if say the parents or other people  bring it to their attention at a later date and we didn't do a report then they would uh discipline  us and some of us face uh dismissal and suspension and things like that so we have to then report it  and then they blow it way out of proportion yeah mike i i believe that you guys are just doing your 
[02:10:30]  job that was told to you but uh it's it's it's the people above you that got to do situation to  situation well it seems like it's like what happens in all these cases there's probably been like a  history of disciplinary problems or major problems that just people are like and they blew over and  the next thing you know the kids got an ak-47 so they're trying to cut it off from the beginning  but they're not using common sense by a steak knife or a steak a stick i mean come on they're throwing  the baby out with the bath water oh easy not only that though but they they really really paint us into 
[02:11:00]  a corner because we know that it's nothing and we try to you know manage our class and dismiss it  and then you know two days later somebody's parent calls up and says oh i had an incident and then  they come back to us and say how come you didn't report that and they get come down on us so hard  and try to make a point an example out of us but mike as a teacher you're sitting there in your  classroom i think with after the first week of school you can look around your classroom and go  that kid's a problem she's a slut he's the brain he's the nerd and this weirdo is into emo music 
[02:11:30]  especially after as a high school teacher it's the first day or two yeah you know right off the  bat so then if a girl comes in with a little steak from uh mommy and she brings a steak knife to cut  up her dumb steak you you kind of know that this girl's not the problem oh absolutely you know i  have one more comment also sure uh opie's uh little grammy moment this morning yeah sounds like he had a  um he had a couple minutes alone with lonnie hazard and some sausage bringer longer

[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  We got to turn off Maury.  It's the same shit every day.  Every day, man.  I love Maury, but goddamn Maury.  Is he the father? 
[02:17:00]  I know the paternity things.  Is she the mother?  Is that E-Rock or a fat lady?  A marriage is on the line.  Once in a blue moon, he's got the little freak shows and things like that.  But for the most part, he's done all these.  It literally is three subjects.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think the marriage is on the line if both people are ugly.  I think they just put up with a lot of shit if you're both ugly.  Your spouse can be cheating.  You can be having kids with some other woman. 
[02:17:30]  You just stay together because you really don't have a choice in the end.  You're both ugly.  It's just how it works.  As stupid as that sounds.  What are we looking at?  I have a stroke on TV.  Oh, really?  This guy's having a stroke on TV.  Yeah, he's talking about something.  Did they show him talking at first, Dan?  Uh, just a little bit.  Smiles. 
[02:18:00]  Wow.  In mid-sentence.  That's how it is to have a stroke?  Wow, look at that.  His eyes just rolled back white.  And his lips are quivering.  Is there audio on this?  And he just slowly went back in his seat.  He's just talking, an older guy, and all of a sudden he just turns into a monster instantly.  Wait, is that India?  And his eyes go white.  Kind of looked like it.  Yeah, they roll back into his head and his lip starts quivering.  It's really uncomfortable.  Oh, look at Al Roker and his fancy hat.  Al Roker!  What's wrong with Al Roker?  I have nothing when he's blogging about I'm...  Oh, okay. 
[02:18:30]  He's fucking spitting his hat and then put it back on his fat, bald, potato-ish head.  Nice stomach stapling, pig-o.  We called you fat again.  Pig-o.  I don't like his fucking gumshoe outfit.  He's trying to look like a detective in the 50s.  A private dick.  Hey, we gotta stop with Toys for Tots, by the way.  Why?  Enough toys for the Tots?  Yeah, we're doing it in our building and I took a peek.  A little peek-a-roonie and the toys suck.  Well, they only give them the crappy toys. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Because we all think we're do-gooders by, like, buying a crappy toy and throwing it on the pile.  And don't tell me, like, that's good enough and that...  No.  They want anything.  It doesn't matter.  No, they don't.  They want a Wii.  They want Xbox.  They want the hot toys.  Actually, I think we should just cancel Christmas and then it takes care of the problem.  For them.  Huh?  We should just cancel Christmas.  For them.  Why?  Oh, just for them?  Yeah.  Tell them it's been canceled.  Because they get crappy toys every year. 
[02:19:30]  And it just makes them, like, miss the good toys that much more.  Any game that has a Pop-O-Matic in the middle is a horrid game.  You don't want that.  Any game that doesn't have a plug.  They don't want things that don't plug in or use batteries.  What I'm going to do, I'm going to get a list of the toys that are under this Christmas tree in my building just to prove my point.  Because it would make this rant a little better.  It's garbage.  Half the stuff I'd never heard of.  And back in the day when I was working in Rochester, did I tell the story where we had to drop toys off to, like, the ghetto? 
[02:20:00]  And Ray Noon, he's a great guy.  He just got fired, actually.  He was one of the many that got fired from CMF.  He had an amazing car.  I forgot what it was.  Like, a brand new Mercedes or Beamer or Porsche.  Something just ridiculous that showed everybody, I'm doing well.  Look how rich I am, right?  And we all had to team up.  We collected toys for a month.  And we all had to go on our merry way and deliver the toys to these homes. 
[02:20:30]  And I had to go with Ray in his brand new sports car, even though I was making $12,000 a year.  And we would stop in front of these scary-ass fucking projects and houses and stuff and deliver the toys.  I'm like, you're insane.  They're going to take your car.  And then we would just hand over the toys, just a bag full of crap. 
[02:21:00]  I'm the only one willing to admit it.  And you could just see the disappointment on their face.  Of course.  And they were appreciative because they're poor and they don't have any money for Christmas.  But you could tell.  One look in the bag and they're like, oh.  More of this garbage.  Great.  Thanks.  Another year of this crap.  Obviously.  They're not stupid.  It's all the toys we don't want to give our own kids.  So we give it to the, you know, the less, the quote, less fortunate.  The non-whites.  Just saying.  I think it's better to not, like, donate a toy to Toys for Tots unless you donate a toy that you know your own kid would have loved. 
[02:21:30]  A deck of Old Maid cards.  How about that?  What a shitty gift for kids.  Why?  Goldfish, Old Maid are fun games.  Oh, they don't want to play that.  But see, it makes everyone feel good like they're doing the right thing by, you know, you know what you're doing.  You're going to the toy store and you're looking at all the craps that's not selling that's cheap.  Five and dime shit. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  And most people do it just because they want to feel a little better about themselves.  Here's the little plastic soldier with the parachute that you have to throw up in the air and it comes down.  Because they feel, because they have that guilt inside them.  Yeah.  And this takes away a little of that guilt.  But does it?  Does it really?  You're buying a doll that no one wants because it was cheap.  Yeah, not even a name brand doll for the little girls.  Tim from Boston.  He writes, toys for tots equals re-gift shitty toys. 
[02:22:30]  When I was a very, very little boy, I had a doll.  I forget what doll it was.  And I put my penis through it and my friend sucked my penis like it was the doll's penis.  We were the same age.  Did you just tell this?  Yeah, you said that just now.  I never told it before.  I just told it.  No, you told this already.  Oh, did I?  I don't even remember.  I don't remember that one.  I don't think so.  Dude, the Philly crew was talking about that very story this weekend.  I'm like, holy shit, I got awful deja vu. 
[02:23:00]  But no.  They were saying how weird that fuck it is.  Oh, I don't remember.  If I did, I honestly don't remember.  I'm almost positive because the Philly crew, they listened to every show and they were  like, they brought the time up that you did exactly what you just said.  Oh, okay.  I have no recollection.  I'm trying to remember.  Incredible Hulk doll.  Thank you.  Butcher remembers.  Oh, okay.  I did.  Incredible Hulk doll.  Yeah, because I think I wondered if you were big enough to even get it through to the  other side.  Yeah, my, wow.  Yeah, now I'm remembering.  I thought my brain was short circuiting, but no, yeah, you did tell that. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, I was a very little boy.  I was like, what the fuck?  It wasn't even green.  Wait, why would you stick your dick?  I'm hoping you're not waiting for a rational answer.  Well, technically, I was, I don't know.  I just wanted my dick sucked and I figured like an innocent way to get it done.  And I figured the other kid didn't feel like he was doing anything gay because he was  blowing the Hulk out of respect.  And not his friend.  It is.  Not his friends with peanut butter and jelly fingers holding the Hulk's legs.  It is pretty funny that it was a Hulk doll.  Of course it was.  I couldn't have picked a Batman or a fucking white guy. 
[02:24:00]  A green muscular man with a cock muscle look monstrous.  Appropriate for the Hulk.  A hairless boy dick.  What the fuck were you?  How old were you?  30.  I don't know.  I was very young.  I have no idea.  Someone wants to know if the toy was a wall with a hole in it.  No.  It was a Hulk doll.  It was Lou Ferrigno, actually.  He blew me.  I saw him coming and he couldn't hear me.  I was shot in his mouth.  The toy was called Mr. Wall.  You can have fun with Mr. Wall. 
[02:24:30]  Uh, yeah, see a lot of people saying you told that.  All right, cool.  Okay, I don't remember.  I just, I...  No, that was just so weird because I don't think it's been played in a long time, but  we, the Philly crew was talking about this two days ago in my apartment in between smelling  my awful sweatpants.  Oh.  Yeah, it was a Hulk doll coming in like crazy, of course.  Okay.  Okay, folks, thank you.  I can't believe I said that and don't remember.  I confess being blown by a boy through a Hulk doll and I don't remember.  That's how fucking depraved my life is.  I've said that on radio and I'm like, oh, did I already tell that story? 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Don't you have any new stories to me?  I know.  I'm glad I didn't just lie right now and say it was a Shazam doll.  I remember.  Right.  Jim Neighbors blew me.  We should start Toys for Twots.  Well, I mean, you know.  Of course we can't.  I don't like the language.  That's an old radio bit.  Yeah.  I was just joking.  It's a hacky bit that a lot of morning shows have done just to show that they're edgy.  How about we give out tampons and call it Toys for Clots? 
[02:25:30]  All right, we're on to something now.  I don't think Toys for Clots has ever been done.  Of course not.  That's not even appropriate during this festive time of the year.  Somebody said perhaps it was a G.I. Blow doll.  G.I. Blow.  That was cigars and scotch.  All right, we got a terrible voiceover audition tape. 
[02:26:00]  We're doing a little cleanup as the year comes to an end here.  I like bloopers.  Well, it's not bloopers.  Isn't it a blooper?  No, this guy really thinks he's got a good voice for voiceovers, and this is his audition tape.  Oh.  This was sent in by Andy in Oakdale.  This is good stuff.  Guy introduces himself and does his sarcastic, annoyed voice.  I'm just going to kind of talk for you so you get a general idea of my voice.  So, you can decide if I'm the right for your part. 
[02:26:30]  I hope I am.  Um, I can do most genres.  My best genres are comedy and drama.  I can also do all types of emotions.  Um, my best of those are sarcastic and annoyed.  Here's an example.  Oh, God.  Gag me with a spoon, somebody.  Yeah, that's from the 80s.  A time I'm sure you're familiar with, Vern.  At least his mouth sounds well lubricated.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Tasty mouthed fruit.  Oh. 
[02:27:00]  God.  You're tasting a victim.  Damn, that's awful.  He's perfect.  I think we found the guy that blew you back in the day.  Yes.  Wait, the Hulk's dick's a different...  Why is that like...  It was replayed last week.  The Hulk story.  Oh, okay.  And Billy Con...  Billy Connolly was in.  Oh.  Or Bill Connolly, right?  Billy.  It's Bill Burr and Billy Connolly.  Yeah.  That, uh...  That kid's horrible.  Yeah.  Uh, he demonstrates his sad voice in this next one. 
[02:27:30]  Sad?  We heard, uh...  How did your parents die?  We heard sarcastic and annoying.  Now we hear sad.  This is sad.  I'm good at sad, too.  Here is another example.  Oh, my God.  Lily.  Lily, talk to me.  I...  I...  I...  I can't go on like this without you.  This is a joke.  Come on.  This couldn't...  He couldn't be this awful.  Who is this?  This is not a joke. 
[02:28:00]  Steve says it's real.  It's absolutely real.  It's real.  I don't know what the fuss is.  This guy's got talent.  You like him for your next bit.  Yeah.  He demonstrates his adult male and lisp voices in this next clip.  Who is he, by the way?  Yeah, who is he?  Do you know any more involved?  You know what?  Honestly, this has been around for a while.  If I took a look at the CD, I could find where this came from.  This has been around for months, though.  Maybe we could use him for something.  Oh.  Yeah.  This is good.  Andy and Oakdale.  Let's use his mouth as a pussy. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, I think this guy legitimately, like, has a sight that he's trying to...  Yeah.  He's trying to promote himself as a voiceover guy.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  He's on the radio.  I can be an adult, too, so if you're short on male adults, then I can do that part.  Bet you will.  Samantha, stick to your studies or you're off the basketball team.  I can do a lisp, too.  So I have a little lisp.  No problem.  Seriously.  I promise.  Can you do a guy who's not a faggot? 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Do someone who doesn't sound completely gay.  What a fucking mo.  He's a one-trick pony.  Yeah.  This one.  Awful.  One-trick horse gag.  Finally, he demonstrates his fake laugh and says, thank you for listening.  Oh, wait.  That would be audio of me.  Oh.  See, because I fake laugh, according to some people.  Here we go.  You?  Do you really?  I don't think you do.  Yeah, that's one of the things they try to beat me up about. 
[02:29:30]  I'm also pretty good at a fake laugh.  Here's that for you.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  No.  Why am I the only one laughing?  So, I'd love to be a part of your Sims 2 movie.  If you're interested, please allow me some time to get the lines done.  You can all contact me at Hotmail or Yahoo.  I hope you pick me for your movie.  Thank you all, and goodbye. 
[02:30:00]  No, this is real.  You know what?  I'm thinking maybe you're right, because he's not trying to be ironic.  He's just worthless.  Yeah.  Ha, he sucks.  Yeah, because for a second there, you're thinking maybe he is being ironic.  But no, he's for real.  So what?  They were casting for a movie or something, Steve?  Is that the deal?  The hell was that?  I think so.  I think they were casting.  It was like an open casting call for some independent film,  and he threw his voiceover demo, which he thought was impressive online.  And it was pointed out to us as awful voiceover audition.  So I'm going to try to find out where it came from initially. 
[02:30:30]  All right.  And Mike D is here?  Yep.  Where is he?  He's a teacher?  Why are we having him in?  Mike DiStefano.  Comedian.  Oh.  Where the fuck is he?  No, because someone said Mike from Rana Fez was a teacher, so I got confused.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  And we were talking about the whole weapons in school thing,  so I was thinking he was going to give us his take on that.  Never mind.  Yeah, I know Mike was coming in as well.  Oh, DiStefano's not here.  Yeah, he's right there.  Where is he?  Oh, I didn't see you.  He's right there.  When did you get here?  Been here for a few minutes. 
[02:31:00]  What's up, Mike?  Oh, dude, I didn't fucking know.  What's happening?  How you doing?  Hi, sweetie.  What are you doing, Mike?  You could point to a chair.  He don't give a shit.  He'll sit in whichever one he wants, whichever one he damn well pleases.  We blew up, me and my brother blew up a bag of balls when we were in high school with  blockbusters.  Right.  Nothing.  I got community service and nothing.  Oh, wow. 
[02:31:30]  You mean in high school?  Yeah, we blew up.  We made a bomb.  A bomb, yeah.  We had two blockbusters duct-taping together.  Blew up.  They had a bag of balls in the gym, you know, like hanging.  Yeah.  The rubber ones.  Yeah, sure.  We blew it up.  We both got caught.  It wasn't that big of a deal.  No, they didn't care.  Well, that was the, you know, that's a different time.  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  We were talking about this morning, there was a girl that brought a steak knife into school  and cut a little steak and she got in trouble.  A lot of trouble, actually.  Possibly a felony charge now or something like that. 
[02:32:00]  Jesus.  Yeah, because they can't, everyone's afraid of being like singling somebody out and saying  let it, you know.  Yeah, we're growing a nation of fucking weak little douchebags.  That's what's going to, it's ridiculous.  Yeah.  Well, they're attempting to.  Yeah.  I don't think they'll succeed.  Because there's no individuals anymore.  You can't deal with anything on an individual basis.  They all got to be lumped into one category and you'll have the zero tolerance policy so that  if a kid comes in with a gun looking to kill everybody or a kid comes in with a spoon with 
[02:32:30]  a handle looking a little too sharp, they fall into the same category and they're both dealt  with the same way.  And it's all based on like one fucking incident that happens.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, even the terrorist attack, you know, I don't want to be a dick, but it happened  to us once in our whole fucking history, you know.  Other countries go through it every month, you know.  So, and here it's like, now there's the orange alert today.  I heard that today.  They're still saying that? 
[02:33:00]  The alert.  We're on the orange alert today?  Yeah.  That's what we always are, I think.  Most stopped paying attention to the alert thing a while ago.  It's retarded.  It's just to make us afraid so we'll buy shit to quell the fear.  I'm telling you, I think that's what it comes down to.  There's some fucking, I'm not in a good space this week.  Why?  What happened?  No, it just, because in comedy, as a stand-up, you know, that's really what I, that's all  I really fucking know about.  Drugs, stand-up, and little bits of crime in my life.  That's my whole life story. 
[02:33:30]  Little bits of crime.  And like this week, there's a club, and I'm not going to get into who, what, and where,  but there's this big, fat, Jewish-American gentleman that just took over a club in Times  Square.  He took over a club, and this guy's a fucking filth bag.  He is a scumbag, and I'm doing, I've been there for three years, I kill in this place.  I'm kind of blue, you know, I do my thing, but I kill, I do what I gotta do.  And this guy comes in, within a week, he has me fucking taking off the scale.  I can't, you can't play early shows, he told, the booker told me. 
[02:34:00]  Why are they getting PC in comedy clubs?  In a club.  That should be the last place.  I, I hate it, but I understand radio-wise, but.  Yeah.  I don't really understand, but I, I, but I, I guess the,  there's advertisers, there's advertisers in radio.  Right, right, right.  So you understand why they have to bend over.  Right, I'm not in a fucking comedy club.  Not in a comedy, there's only two clubs left in New York.  That should be the last place they go after.  There's two clubs left in New York.  I'm not going to say the names of them, Caroline's in the cellar, but the rest of them, 
[02:34:30]  no, it's the truth, man.  Which club is douching you?  You might as well.  It was the Laugh Factory, and they, the Laugh Factory hasn't really been douching.  They, they've been pretty cool with me, because, you know what it is?  It's a whole, it's a fucking porn joint, first of all.  Yeah.  The guy that owns it, a porn guy, he opened a comedy club with Jamie Masada from fucking  L.A., you know, don't say N-word, it's on a ban.  Yeah, we know.  I said, I said it 50 times the night he banned it.  I still stay there.  Fuck him.  Anyway, the point is that.  We've had Jamie on a bunch of times. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We, you know.  We tolerate him.  Yeah, yeah.  You have a lot of tolerance for him.  Well, I mean, we, we know the same people and all, but I don't, I don't agree with pretty  much anything he says.  You ban, whatever.  He's, he's got a little, a little too much power there with the N-word and all that.  Well, what happens is, uh.  Banning the N-word from a comedy club, that's completely insane.  Jimmy brought up a point, you know, about the gangs and stuff in L.A., but I'm just,  well, I don't know.  I didn't mind him banning it.  No, you said the funniest thing about not letting black people in the club anymore. 
[02:35:30]  That was fucking classic.  That's the funniest thing said about, Norton said it on your show, when Jamie was here,  Jamie was going, buddy, I don't want to have big problems in L.A., we have the riots and  blah, blah, blah.  So, so, uh, we banned the N-word.  It's, and Jimmy said, uh, real quiet, you know, he said, uh, he goes, instead of banning  the N-word, why don't you just stop letting black people into the club?  And to me, yeah, it was just funny.  I understood it because the gang threats he was getting, it's almost like they were threatening 
[02:36:00]  to firebomb his club.  Right.  He's in a really weird position.  Yeah.  Jamie's one thing, you know, Jamie, you could see coming.  If you give Jamie, uh, if he hurts you in any way, you deserved it.  Right.  Because the guy just oozes scum.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I'm a fucking filth bag.  Now, now, so he was partners in this club.  He left.  Wait, Jamie's not part of that club anymore?  No, no.  He's not part of the club.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a real whatever.  But all the staff there, the one thing about him, they really didn't, they don't know about 
[02:36:30]  stand-up, which was actually good because all they did was go, wow, this guy makes everyone  laugh.  We like him.  They didn't fucking, what is he saying?  Yeah.  Everyone's laughing.  And comedy, that's what it is.  I saw you.  You were hilarious.  I didn't feel like you were like over the top dirty.  Thanks.  Not at all.  Well, this guy, no, no.  This guy that, um, I mean, you're definitely edgy, but there was this guy that came in  now.  He took over.  They were going to, it was going to be called the mad comedy club.  See, Times Square, you don't have to, Times Square, you can sell anything. 
[02:37:00]  There's so many people there and they're not repeat customers.  So who cares if they see a shit show or not?  They don't give a fuck.  So this guy comes in and, and within two days, he, he, my schedule got all fucked up.  I'm on two o'clock in the morning, one day.  So I called the booker, I said, what, why, why do you have me on so late, man?  I don't play that late.  He said, well, uh, you know, Mike, I'm trying.  I said, what the fuck happened?  He said, well, Marty, this guy, Marty, this fucking old creep, uh, who hates my guy.  He just don't like me. 
[02:37:30]  Anyway.  Is he a guy from New York comedy?  Yeah.  You know, he sits in the back and fucking jerks.  So I don't know what he does.  Right.  Look at the face.  That's what the guy is.  A fucking animal.  And I promise.  No, no.  Hey, Opie.  I said, I'm not going to bring the guy's name up.  Cause I don't want to, you know.  I'm just curious.  I mean.  No, I'm going to finish.  You got me going.  We have a lot of power on this show.  We turn a lot of people on to new comics.  Yeah.  And, and great comedy clubs.  It's not.  And I'll be honest.  I've never been to the Laugh Factory in Times Square.  I never had the urge to go there for whatever reason. 
[02:38:00]  Well, cause it seems like a, you know, I've been to comics.  I've been to the Cellar.  I've been to Dangerfield, which is just a fucking funeral.  Dangerfield.  Yeah.  New York is wonderful.  Caroline's.  Yeah.  You know.  Well, I.  The thing.  All right.  So, so the guy, the booker, I, he said to me, well, uh, Marty said, you can only play  late shows because you're too dirty for him.  So I said, fine.  I go, uh, tell Marty to go fuck his mother.  I swear. 
[02:38:30]  And he go, he go, I go, are you writing this down?  Write this down.  I want it word for word.  You tell him to go fuck his mother.  This guy would let people fuck his dead sister.  If they paid for two drinks, the two drink minimum.  You could watch my dead sister get hammered in the air.  Like, that's the kind of fucking filthy is now.  And so, so I told the kid that now, now this is like, now I fully understand, by the way,  why I don't see you on TV.  Because I saw you at Dennis Leary and friends are like, this motherfucker's hilarious. 
[02:39:00]  Why haven't I seen him around?  I'll get there.  I feel like you might have a little bit of a problem.  Anger?  Anger issue?  No, I don't really.  Like, like.  Fuck your mother.  I mean.  Cause, cause.  A dead sister.  No, but Opie, you gotta understand, man.  Mike, I'm with you, actually.  This is all I got left, man.  I got no fucking.  I got nothing else.  Yeah.  You know, you, I'm sure.  Hey, I don't know how it felt to get taken off the air, to be fucked with.  Oh, it was great.  It was awesome.  No, when you were by yourself, there had to be a bad feeling inside.  Like, fuck.  Of course.  Not really.  You're fucking with my. 
[02:39:30]  No, not really.  We had to make believe, uh, you know, that we wanted people to feel sorry for us, but  actually, you know.  You're full of shit, man.  It was kind of cool.  I mean, the millions were rolling in.  They still had to pay.  No, no.  See, now.  Oh, yeah.  Now, forget the money.  I got to go wherever the fuck I wanted for two years.  The money's one thing.  I'm losing $25 a spot when I get thrown out of a club.  You know what I mean?  No, I'm actually.  The money's gotta hurt.  I'm actually with you.  When people fuck with your livelihood, it's.  Yeah, of course.  You guys, I don't know you well.  Here's what I think about you.  You guys are fucking millionaires, and you dress like fucking animals.  Yeah.  So, you know, you're down to earth. 
[02:40:00]  Scum.  And creative.  Yeah, you know.  Look at Jimmy.  Jimmy's got a great career.  Look at him.  He just fucking wears sneakers and hangs out.  He's not trying to.  I explained that yesterday.  I don't feel like I deserve good things, so that's why I continue to dress like I'm,  you know.  Guess what?  You just like me now.  Like I'm making $15,000 a year.  Then you like fucking me and the rest of us.  Right.  Now, so can I finish with this story, or do you want me to shut up?  Oh, sure.  I want to hear it.  No, Anthony, come on.  Yeah.  I want to hear it.  Anthony, I like this.  I guess the 20 people still listening to the show, I guess.  No, I like this shit. 
[02:40:30]  You could try to get them to turn to the Zepo channel as well.  I want to hear what happened.  After the fucking guy.  This is amazing.  Go ahead.  Go fuck your mother.  That's where we were in the letter.  No, so I said that sort of, they call me back.  Now, the booker calls me back the next day and tells me, Mike, everybody went to bat  for you.  All the staff argued with him.  He said, and he said, he's going to pay you for the spots he canceled, because I told him  that's one of the deals.  You pay me for every spot you canceled this week, whatever.  So they called me, and it was nice. 
[02:41:00]  I felt good.  I was like, you know what?  Everyone looked down for me.  Fine.  Put me back on the schedule.  The next night, I had a meeting with Dennis Leary's people.  Like, we had a meeting after that show I did, and I called.  They said, look, I have a really important meeting.  I'm going to, I can't make the spot tonight.  Well, Mike, there's a new policy.  If you cancel a spot, they take you off the whole week.  Oh, shit.  And you had a great reason.  Yeah.  So I said to him, well.  You know, zero tolerance, obviously.  Yeah, exactly.  They got a new zero tolerance policy.  Let's go back to the weapons in school. 
[02:41:30]  Zero tolerance.  You know, for uppity comics.  See, this is the difference between what you're saying and hanging out with Jimmy.  Jimmy, the seller, a lot of big names go in there.  Yeah.  But you could easily call up Esty and go, look, Esty, I can't make my spot tonight because  I'm going to be on Jay Leno or I'm going to have a meeting with HBO or something.  And like that, she just says, okay.  She don't like when you cancel spots.  But she understands that it's part of what you are as a comic that you've got other opportunities  that you can't blow off.  But go ahead, Mike.  Esty's like, she's a gate. 
[02:42:00]  Fascinating.  Yeah.  Is it really?  Don't break my book.  I'm very sensitive.  You guys don't understand.  People think I'm a tough guy.  I'm a fucking tender guy.  I'm very sensitive.  I'll fucking split your head with a hammer.  No, but after trying to talk to you, I'll try.  You'll split our head with a hammer.  Not your head.  But then you'll feel bad about it and cry afterwards.  Listen, I punched a guy once at a show.  Nice.  All right, you guys are going to get me set up.  It was at the Ha Comedy Club over there.  I used to go there all the time to do spots when I first started. 
[02:42:30]  What's the Ha Comedy Club?  It's a club on 47th.  Anyway, I go in there and...  Oh, Restaurant Row.  Yeah, we're outside the club and there's these two Spanish guys standing there.  Like they were waiting for me to beat the fuck out of me.  And I don't know what I said to them.  Whatever.  So one of them's standing.  Here, the other one's to my left.  This guy starts with blah, blah, blah.  I said, bro, I don't...  Come on, it's comedy.  I don't know what happened.  The other guy, I see him clocking his hand back.  So I drilled him. 
[02:43:00]  I drilled him.  This guy was unconscious standing up.  You ever see that happen?  It was beautiful.  His eyes rolled.  I fucking went in the bar and brought out a bag of ice and put it on his face for him  and said, look, why are you fucking swinging at me?  And I'm trying to talk to him.  What a guy.  That's how I am.  What did he...  What happened?  Nothing.  Well, nothing happened.  They were nice then.  We were friends.  He went out for coffee after that, right?  So this fuck over...  Why don't we call Marty?  Can we get Marty in the air?  No, he's a scumbag. 
[02:43:30]  He don't even have a phone, probably.  He's an animal, right?  So he got...  But he's out of there.  Here's what happened.  They called me yesterday.  And I said to the kid, I saw his number.  I said, what's up, BJ?  I said, why are you calling me, bro?  I told you not to call me unless Marty Fisher was dead.  It's the only way I want to hear from you.  And he said, Mike, he's out.  They threw him out.  He's already starting to fucking embezzle shit and fuck with the money.  So they fired him.  Well, that's what Mike's saying.  I have no idea.  And I'm back there.  So you're back there.  Yeah.  So that story wasn't worth telling. 
[02:44:00]  All's good with you.  Not really.  No, there's a lot of drama in there.  There was a lot of drama.  Yeah.  I like any comedian motherfucking club owners and stuff like that.  Hell yeah.  Most of us don't do it.  So I enjoy that.  Well, you probably did it years ago.  I mean, not.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, now.  Jim used to do it with his act.  You can't have any self-worth as a comic until you're making enough money.  Right.  And I just don't.  I'm not going for that.  I can't live like that. 
[02:44:30]  You know, I can't.  Not that I don't go around arguing with nobody.  But this guy, you know, certain things you can't.  You don't fucking tell.  You don't start taking me off the schedule after three years of killing in that fucking place.  So now you're back to doing your thing.  Well, yeah.  Now I'm back over there.  Yeah.  Whenever I want.  You know, I'm treated good over there.  But when this guy came in, I wasn't.  And that's the way the business is.  And Pete, they try to censor you.  Now, down at the cellar when I first was there, the early shows, she likes you to be not too rough. 
[02:45:00]  You know?  So SD came to me, said, Mike, look, I'm not censoring you, but can you tone it a little bit on the early show?  I said, absolutely.  Can I ask you a question about that early show, late show crap?  People going to a comedy club, is there really a difference between the early show crowd and the late?  There is, but there shouldn't be, I don't think.  I mean, there is.  The difference, obviously, is alcohol consumption.  Like, you get a drunker crowd later.  But the ones that come early really want to see cleaner stuff?  Is that true?  I don't know.  They're more conservative, I think. 
[02:45:30]  A little bit.  Like, you know, like, you picture your family is probably going to go out more likely for an 8 o'clock show and a dinner will be home by 10.  So there is some philosophy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, later shows.  I mean, I don't run a club, so I don't know.  But she's not saying clean.  She's saying don't do the cunt kicking joke at 730.  You know that joke you do when you punch the girl in the cunt on the subway?  Don't do that.  Can you not do that for me?  She asked me, like, you know, and I guess Manny, I never met the guy, but the spirit of that place is just about stand-up. 
[02:46:00]  It really is.  And there's a three-drink thing there.  Do you know that?  Maximum.  A lot of comics don't even know that.  You can only have three drinks there.  Like, that's how committed they are to having a good show.  Really?  They don't want people fucking drunk and no parties of eight or more.  If you're eight or more, because fucking comedy clubs love giant work parties.  Yeah.  Cellar, eight or more, you are not permitted to sit together.  They will not allow you in the room.  That's important because...  You're not yapping.  Yes.  Just yapping.  I've been to a club, yeah.  They've got two or three tables filled with people they work with, and they just can't help but... 
[02:46:30]  You tell a joke, and then the guy at the table goes, hey, that happened in the office the other day, remember?  And then they all start talking and shit, and it's retarded, you know?  But that is what we do as patrons.  There's pain in the asses.  We relate to what you guys say up there, and we have to elbow and go, that's me.  That's me.  Me.  Oh, it's funny because it's true.  Right, right.  Those are the tough ones, by the way, to deal with.  It's not...  A guy motherfucking you on stage, you can deal with because he's being a prick and everybody knows it. 
[02:47:00]  But a guy who likes you, who's like, yeah, hey, all right, Jimmy.  Like, there was a guy recently in Scranton doing that.  He meant well.  He was having fun, but it's like, you, sir, are a fucking...  You're trampling everything, and I want a fucking...  I want your heart to stop beating him in a sentence, but you know he's not trying to fuck you, so you can't hit him too hard.  This girl, the other night I did a...  Well, two weeks ago, I did this really cute rape joke that I do for the holidays. 
[02:47:30]  Cute.  And...  Can you tell it?  It's not even a joke.  I just said that raping a stripper shouldn't be a felony because it's like taking extra food out of a buffet, you know?  You paid a certain amount, you took a few extra ribs or something, huh?  So...  So this girl...  Oh, this girl...  But they're just trying to work their way through college, Mike.  Yeah.  And I don't have a lot of that kind of...  They used to be sluts back in the day, but now they're just, you know...  I only do that one...  Some girls are trying to pay their way through college.  I do that kind of material just to annoy people. 
[02:48:00]  It's hilarious, by the way.  It's not really part of my...  That's hilarious, by the way.  You know?  And then...  So anyway, this girl fucking almost was in tears.  You ever have that happen, Jim?  Yeah.  Where they're upset.  They're emotionally connected to what you said.  And I'm like...  She used the word horrifying.  You guys were talking to me about...  You said...  What's that?  No tolerance policy.  Everyone has their own vulgarity.  Right.  When I'm hearing people go, we have a no tolerance policy, and the Asian American community is 
[02:48:30]  going to get to get...  I want to throw up.  That language is vulgar to me.  It's phony, and it's fucking vulgar.  Cursing...  Don't bother me.  You're like Bill...  Everyone says Bill Cosby.  You don't...  You ever get...  Why don't you be like Bill Cosby?  And for a finger a girl who stops over?  Exactly.  After giving her a fucking melatonin?  There you go.  So I say, well, Bill Cosby doesn't curse.  This is true.  I curse like a fucking animal.  Thirteen women accused him of molesting them. 
[02:49:00]  Thirteen.  Wow.  I've done it.  I've...  That's the way to search.  Thirteen.  All right, let's...  Accused him.  Four women accused me and Jim.  We'll probably allegedly on that one, too.  They gotta use the word allegedly a lot.  Allegedly.  Yeah.  Mike guy.  Well, they allegedly...  And I'm not saying he did it.  I'm not saying he did it.  But after eight accusations, somebody, you know, got a finger in the ass that wasn't...  You know, they didn't want...  Something happened.  I just had to lift my seat up.  People don't curse.  And Sean from Monroe, right?  No, no.  What's the matter? 
[02:49:30]  I really had to lift my seat up.  No, no.  I was sinking.  I'll tell you what's going on here.  I'm very good at observations.  And Mike took his last appearance on the show very seriously.  He didn't say much.  Who was in here?  Rich Voss?  I didn't say anything because the show was so good.  I knew not to interrupt.  I'll be honest.  Voss and Bobby Kelly.  Mike didn't get a lot in.  Yeah.  And I think he went home and he's been obsessing about that since.  No.  You know, next time I get a chance on that fucking show, I'm going to show them. 
[02:50:00]  No, well, there's only us, guy, you know.  You haven't stopped talking since you sat down.  Yeah, but Jimmy, Jimmy's a good guy, like he knows me, you know, a little bit.  Yeah.  You guys seem to be like you don't really want to work today, so I'm fucking throwing  the shit out there.  I think you fucking got that right.  And the last time I was here, that dumb-off was so funny.  Oh, you were part of the dumb-off?  Yeah.  No, I wasn't part of it.  I came in during it.  But you were part of that show.  Over at the other space.  And it was so funny.  We're doing Homeless Pyramid on Thursday?  Yes.  Same type of thing.  Yeah.  We lost in them, but we're matching them up with homeless people. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  And then we're going to do pretty much the same gig.  No, it was baffling how dumb they are.  Yeah, no kidding.  But yet, at the same time, Voss, ten minutes later, will say the most brilliant fucking thing.  Really?  When?  Improving and smashing somebody.  Yeah, improv-ing, he just said something.  Oh, I thought you meant just saying something.  No, no, he doesn't have a lot of good information about things.  No, he's really, really dumb when it comes to just knowledge.  He's almost dysfunctionally stupid.  Like, you're surprised he understands it's food, mouth, swallowing. 
[02:51:00]  Bob Kelly is a different kind of dumb.  Bob is desperate to be, technologically, Bob is fairly brilliant.  And he wants to be sort of as smart.  Yeah.  That's why he rehearses.  He tries so hard to not be the dummy that he really is.  But he's technologically fantastic.  He's great.  Yeah.  Colin Quinn is so brilliant because he pointed Bob out as being a technological bully.  And Colin was so fucking dead on.  He has a Carlin-like ability to narrow things down.  I mean, yeah, he's great.  And Colin's like, Bob's like a techno bully where you'll ask him for help and he'll help 
[02:51:30]  you, but he's like, what are you, stupid?  Come here, dummy.  Like, he just has to bully you while he's helping you.  Fucking Colin is so fucking good.  Like the tech guy in the office.  Yeah, I hate those fuckers.  Fucking Bob does do that.  Speaking of Voss, CokeLogic's video, it's all over the place.  It's one of the ones you can download from iTunes.  Yes.  And we've been number one as far as video podcasts being downloaded, which is pretty cool.  But he's got the one up there with Rich Voss talking about how there were no flavors. 
[02:52:00]  What, until eight years ago or something?  Five years ago.  When did flavor come out?  He'd had a whole discussion and he was trying to convince us all there were no flavors until  five years ago.  Like a potato chips.  Like mostly potato chips.  Like only five years ago, you could start getting different types of potato chips.  And we're looking at him like, you're insane.  Yeah.  Where do you live?  With this lack of knowledge.  He's a dumb guy.  And that's just, I really love Voss. 
[02:52:30]  He's one of my closest friends.  Yeah, he's a great man.  He really is.  He might be my closest confidant.  Yeah.  But he's just a stupid man.  And it's almost like I didn't realize, as years went on, I didn't realize how fucking  dumb he was.  Yeah.  Yeah, you initially think it's some kind of put on.  It has to be.  Because you're like, no, no.  There's no way you can be this stupid and walk the earth.  You know how you know?  You can tell he's also at peace with himself.  Yeah, he doesn't even.  There is a little bit of peace with the man.  He doesn't care.  Yeah.  That he's stupid.  Well, he used to blow drug dealers for drugs. 
[02:53:00]  Well, you know.  After you get to that point.  I think he just dressed sexy for him.  Everything else is gravy.  That's what he said.  He had a drugs.  Yeah.  I did a little drugs.  It was fun.  That was fun.  You liked your drug days?  I did heroin.  That was my thing.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  And everybody, that's like so fascinating to people.  I never smoked pot.  I didn't really drink.  Well, that's fucked up.  Heroin was my gateway drug.  Heroin was your stepping stone.  That was my gateway drug to heroin.  You're supposed to start off slow and get to heroin.  No.  You're not supposed to jump right into it.  No.  Went right to the heroin. 
[02:53:30]  Wow.  How does that work?  Wait a minute.  You might be the first person I've ever met that went right to heroin.  I grew up around it.  There was a lot of heroin dealers in my neighborhood.  There were probably pot dealers, too.  They weren't dealing nickel bags of heroin.  They were dealing pounds of it.  How old were you?  I was 15 when I did it first.  When I started.  Snorting?  Yeah.  I started snorting.  And then they told me how to shoot it.  All right.  Shooting was good.  Did you have your own works?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had my own works.  And it was fun. 
[02:54:00]  It was fun.  It was great.  Heroin was the best.  You're insane.  I can't tell you.  I'm off for drugs now.  I'm off for drugs nine years.  I don't want to fast forward.  So you're 15.  I'm never going to say heroin sucks.  People say if you never tried it, it's like having your dick sucked and a puppy licking  your nose at the same time.  Kind of imagine, right?  You know the beauty of that.  But reverse the participants.  Right.  No.  And then the girl bites your dick off and kills the puppy. 
[02:54:30]  But still.  You wake up the next day and go, I want to do that again.  But dude, at 15, I was scared to drink half a beer.  How does it go through your head that at 15, I'm going to try heroin?  I don't get that.  I had a cast on my arm from my father hitting me with a baseball bat.  Is that real?  Yeah.  I swear to God.  Why did he hit you?  Why not?  Why didn't he?  He broke my arm with a baseball bat.  I don't think there is any why.  But what did you do wrong in his eyes?  What could I have done?  Killed the fucking my little baby brother? 
[02:55:00]  I understand that.  But there was a reason why.  You sound like a therapist that wants me to fucking stay sick.  Fuck you with that therapist shit.  Talk to him.  No, no.  He brings the mumbo jumbo.  He's pushing me towards, like, blaming myself for being beaten.  Is what I'm saying.  My father broke my fucking arm.  You brought it on yourself.  No, but what was the reason?  You should be a rape counselor.  What were you wearing?  Dude, I'm going to relate to you.  Not with broken bones, but, like, my mom would yell and scream when I was a kid.  Same thing.  Over the most stupidest shit. 
[02:55:30]  What he's saying is this.  So what I'm saying is there was some reason why he did.  It's not going to make sense, but what is his reason?  You left your sneakers on the floor?  What dumb thing did you do?  I don't remember.  I swear to God.  Like, my father was just a violent dude.  He was a violent guy.  You know, we grew up in violence.  I live right across the street from a numbers store where my father hung out.  Card games.  All wise guys.  It was just, that's how I grew up.  Hitting kids was normal, but, like, he would overdo it. 
[02:56:00]  And he'd fucking.  So you asked me about shooting the dope.  All right, so you got the arm on the cast.  Yeah, my fucking arm's broken from my father, so I don't, you know, I mean, there's so much  pain, mental anguish that's fucking sticking a needle in my arm.  It's not the needle that hurt.  It's what you're going to get when you hit the plunger.  That's why you do it.  It hurts for a second.  It's a pinch, but then the blowjob and, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Puppy.  All of a sudden, mommy loves you and everything's wonderful.  So you grab the, uh, at 15, you start snorting it from who? 
[02:56:30]  I just neighborhood guys.  That's some dude.  Older?  Yeah, a little bit older than me.  I grew up, I'm from Throgs Neck, you know, you've heard of it?  Throgs Neck in the Bronx.  Sure, they got a bridge there.  I know the bridge.  Yeah, the bridge, yeah, well.  There's actually a neighborhood below that fucking thing?  Yeah, no, the whole, it's all, uh.  Isn't that just part of Queens?  You know, there's a lot of guys from Harlem there that grew up in Harlem.  Italians, they were drug dealers, heroin dealers, you know, so there was a lot of heroin  in the neighborhood.  So I just, I tried it, it was, you know, and I liked it. 
[02:57:00]  What did you get the first time out of it?  You throw, I threw up like an animal.  Like, sick, but no, but, and you want to die, but then when you stop throwing up and  the drug does its thing, you're like, that was so worth it.  I want more, you know?  Wow.  No, it's a great, it's a, you know, that's why people tell, I get paid, I actually.  When was the next time you did it after that?  The next day.  You were done.  He started his career.  I was hooked in a week. 
[02:57:30]  I was, I was, yeah, I was hooked in like a week.  I had a habit.  Like, I had to have it every day.  What did you do to get it?  Uh, nothing like Voss did.  I've never, what was the worst thing you did to get it?  The worst thing I did, uh.  Robbing people?  Breaking in the holes?  Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.  Robbing people.  Uh, I brought, yeah, B&E's, Great Mansion.  Uh, I'm trying to think of statute of limitations.  I think you're past it.  I want to notice some crimes.  I think you're alright. 
[02:58:00]  No, I did, we did, you know, we did things.  And my family, my brother's a criminal, so like, I would hang with him and do crime,  like, things, and he was not on drugs, so I would get the drugs, you know, we would  do stuff.  So, alright, you snorted for how long?  Maybe a couple years.  And then you went to the needle?  Yeah, the needle.  Why, because you needed a better rush?  It's economics, man.  You sniff ten bags of dope, or you shoot two bags.  What would you, you know what I mean? 
[02:58:30]  Mmm.  You just do it.  That's the philosophy of it.  Yeah.  It's a mess.  I was 18, I was on methadone, I was over at the methadone clinic.  I used to get off at the train at the fucking York Hospital, the same stop as Hunter College.  So I'd be on the train with all these kids that were my age, they were going to college,  I was going to get my methadone.  It was a mess, you know?  And then I went to rehab and started getting clean.  I got clean for a few years, I relapsed again, on and off for 20 years. 
[02:59:00]  And finally, nine years ago, I stopped.  That was it.  What about the tattoos?  I never realized you had so many tattoos.  I just got several of them.  What are the Asian ones?  Tibetan.  I'm actually, I'm into Buddhism, if you can believe it.  Except for the non-violence part.  I don't go for that whole non-violence shit, Anthony.  I think that was like one of the cornerstones of the Buddhist religion.  They say, yeah, they're non-violence.  Yeah, but other than that.  It's like being a Christian, except for the whole Jesus thing. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Weren't you violent just a week ago?  No, no.  With Marty the animal?  No, I wasn't violent.  I was definitely not a good Buddhist, though.  Mike, I like you, man.  Yeah, I try.  And right under Buddha, you have Jesus.  Yeah, look, this was from 20 years ago.  My friend Anthony died when we were kids.  And when he died, I got the Jesus thing, because that's the Italian thing.  And then, you know, I got here and now on my wrists, so I don't forget to fucking stay  in the moment, try to live in the moment, because I'm always all over the place. 
[03:00:00]  And that's about it.  This is a Tibetan prayer.  You sure?  Yeah, no, it is.  It's so money, pardon me, home.  It's a great thing.  I really do.  I really meditate and shit, believe it or not.  Yeah.  It might be a little more of that.  You're not good at it.  Oh, really?  Oh, I'm trying, buddy.  I'm trying.  I've been through a lot, you know what I mean?  So, I'm trying.  And you were funny the whole time?  I don't think I...  When I was on heroin, I wasn't that funny.  But, you know, when I got into rehab and all, I started developing a sense of humor. 
[03:00:30]  Mike's a funny guy.  It's almost like you can tell by talking to a guy if he's a funny guy in the neighborhood  and just a fun guy to shit talk with.  It's like Keith Robinson.  I talk about him a lot.  But, you know, Keith is just a shit talker in a funny way.  Yeah, he's fun.  Ah, shut up.  He's just like one of those guys that it doesn't have to be a punchline.  Just like, I enjoy talking to this guy.  Yeah.  The technicality of being a stand-up is starting to get into me. 
[03:01:00]  But I was always funny, I think.  I always had people laughing.  You know what I mean?  So...  You'd be jail funny.  Like, you'd be funny in jail.  Yeah, yeah.  No doubt.  That's a good thing.  No doubt.  Mike would make guys in jail laugh.  Yeah, yeah.  That's how I survived my life, through jokes.  I really did.  Like, I was never, you know, like, I got a lot of friends that are tough.  You know, like, tough guys, you know what I mean?  And they love me because of my sense of humor.  Not because I'm tough or any of that shit.  You know what I mean?  Right, right.  So, I'm like this guy that survived the neighborhood. 
[03:01:30]  And I'm very loved by a lot of people that are, you know, tough guys.  Like, wise guys.  Like, real street guys.  But they like me because of my sense of humor.  They want me around.  Yeah.  So, it's fun.  You know, it's always...  That's been my thing.  Wow.  Yeah, it's a trip.  That's a hell of a story, man.  Oh, it's nothing, bro.  I can't fucking...  I mean, shit.  Go figure.  Another fucked up comic.  I know.  Another comic that just has a fucking fucked past. 
[03:02:00]  But, yeah, it's the way you relate to it, though, isn't it, though?  Because everyone's got a fucked past, but they're still...  They're dysfunctional, and they're still living it.  I'm not really living it.  I got the anger-ish, you know, stuff like that that's coming out now.  But I'm not really like that.  When was the last time you hit somebody?  It's been a while.  Like, a couple of months.  Like, a couple of months?  That Ha thing.  That was the last time.  The thing at the comedy club with a guy.  But, honestly, the guy was swinging right at my face.  I hear you.  I got him before he got me.  You don't have to convince me.  I was guilty of being quicker than him.  That was it.  There was no... 
[03:02:30]  I'm with you with the anger thing.  I'd slam some guy's, you know, leg with the cab door only Friday.  So, I'm with you, bro.  Yeah.  I'm with you.  And I know how stupid it is, but you gotta do what you gotta do sometimes.  Well, because we don't...  You know, we're men, and we don't know how to fucking, you know, deal with feelings.  Right, right.  If you get embarrassed...  If you embarrass me, I could kill you.  Like, that's how bad...  Yeah?  No, no.  I'm not saying you.  I'm just saying.  Right.  That's my trigger.  Someone fucking embarrasses me. 
[03:03:00]  Like, a lot of guys, a lot of comics do the shit talking, like you were saying.  I stay away from it.  Not that I'm tough or none of it.  I know myself.  One of these guys turn around and say something, like, cute.  I don't know how to take that.  Like, you know, we're not that close.  Like, if we're really close, then it's all bets are off.  But some of them just...  You know, there was another...  I ain't gonna say comics names, because that I won't do.  But this one comic, I was gonna fuck it.  I'm gonna kill him in 15 seconds.  I know, he can't help it.  He just gets riled out.  I know.  It's like, oh, this comedy club owner.  Ah, I'm not gonna go there. 
[03:03:30]  I'm not gonna say his name.  So Marty, the fucking animal, that he is...  He's not really a club owner.  What the comic...  Whatever, but...  Yeah, they just run in their fucking mouth.  They actually went on the radio.  When I got passed at the cellar, this fucking piece of shit was on, like, over at X, the  other radio, the other serious thing.  He was on the Brewer Show, and he was saying, the motherfucker, my D.  Tofano got passed at the motherfucking fella.  That shit is bullshit.  Really?  Yeah, he was a colored fella, if you can hear the accent. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, yeah, it was really...  A colored fella.  Well-veiled fella.  Someone called me and told me, oh, this guy's saying this shit.  All right, so I just went up to him and said, did you say something about me on the radio?  He's like, yeah, man.  I said, look.  I said, I see you bullying a lot of people, but, like, I will fuck, because he has a fucked  up arm, the dude.  Oh, that's what I thought you meant.  So, yeah.  Yeah, so, no.  He has a bad...  No, no, I'm not gonna...  Write the name, because I want it on you.  No, I said, I'll fucking tie my arm behind my back, and I'll fucking punch you to death 
[03:04:30]  the next time you fucking...  And he started bitching like a little girl.  Oh, shit.  Like a little fucking girl.  But that was it.  I thought you were taking on a real black guy.  Jesus.  No, a white guy acting black.  A wigger.  Well, no, what...  He's an actual black wigger.  Why would he...  A bull wigger.  Why would he fucking...  Me.  Motherfuck you.  Why the fuck?  I don't know.  Maybe jealous.  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  I was impressed.  I thought you were taking on a real black guy, man.  No, I wasn't taking on anybody. 
[03:05:00]  That's not the point.  You were taking on the handicapped.  That's not...  I know, but sometimes...  Look, if a guy with liver disease fucking spits in your face, you kick him in the fucking  stomach.  You know what I mean?  What are you going to do?  You do go for the weakness.  I'm not...  It's got nothing to do...  That's how you're taught.  Go for the weakness.  Right.  Exactly.  I'm with you.  Me and you are on the same page, bro.  I'm not really like that, though.  That's not what I'm trying to say.  We're going to bring it out of you.  By 11 o'clock, he's going to beat the shit out of half this guy.  No, I don't want it.  That's what I'm saying.  I hate that.  I can hear the panic in your voice.  You're trying to convince us that you're not like that, but I think right below the surface, 
[03:05:30]  you're like that.  No, I'm a good dude, man.  Are you married?  No.  No.  My wife died.  What?  You ask questions, I'm going to answer them, and the show can go off in a whole other direction.  I don't care.  Not everything has to be funny in the show.  I don't know if I ever told you that.  I was married, my wife, we were clean, we got off drugs, and she got sick with hepatitis,  and she died. 
[03:06:00]  Jeez, Mike.  Any other questions?  Wow.  Boy, you really want people to come to your comedy show, huh?  Dude, no.  Wow.  The laughs will ensue.  This is what I do, man.  Sorry, but...  No, it was a long time.  I mean, it's like 12 years now.  It's been a while.  She died 12 years ago? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  How long were you married?  Six years.  Yeah, yeah.  She was my girl.  Did you know she was going to die, or was it?  Yeah, I knew she got sick after a couple years.  I knew she was ill, and I stuck her out.  And they couldn't turn this around?  Nah, nah.  Once you have shed all kinds of shit, forget it.  She ended up with a lot of lung damage and shit from pneumonias.  It was horrible, huh?  Yeah.  But, no, dude, you know, listen.  This is what makes me who I am.  This is why I'm the way I am.  And this is what makes me a good comic, you know, at least. 
[03:07:00]  A good comic, you know, or somebody that the people know they're listening to something.  They're not just fucking hearing...  I just gotta write notes.  ...you know, jokes that are from somewhere else.  You know, it's coming from inside, like, you know, the pain.  Yeah.  Let me just write this note.  Never have Mike on again.  Oh, jeez.  He might actually kill somebody.  No.  Somebody.  Mike's a sweet boy.  You got any other questions?  What do you want to share, man?  I mean, you're doing good so far.  Um.  Fuck, we would have blown off the goddamn, uh, are you smarter than a fifth grader if we 
[03:07:30]  knew you had this shit coming out of you.  See?  I'm trying to tell you.  Some tragedy in there, huh?  It's so...  It's not a big deal.  Like, everyone...  Yeah, but so what?  It's kind of a big deal.  It's not.  You know what?  It shouldn't be a big deal.  To lose your wife?  That's a biggie.  That's a biggie for me, but it shouldn't be a big deal to talk about it.  That's why, you know...  Oh, I don't...  I'm not uncomfortable.  Even in some ways, that's why this country, this shit you were saying before, how we're  all fucking weak, because there's no... 
[03:08:00]  People don't want to look at nothing.  They want to...  These little fucking douchebags.  These young kids with that stupid look of hope walking around, like, ooh, everything's  going to work out.  It's not, you little douchebag.  Stupid look of hope.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it's unreasonable.  It's unreasonable.  Yeah.  There's no hope out there?  There is hope, but it's hope...  But you're going to suffer, you motherfucker.  Yeah.  And the hope is that you get through it.  Not that you avoid it.  I do laugh when I hang out with, like, high school kids, you know, within the family. 
[03:08:30]  Look at these guys.  What the fuck are we doing?  We want to see tits and people farting.  I do laugh when you do talk to kids that are still in high school and they have such dreams  and you're like, you have no fucking idea.  It's not going to happen the way you want.  I had a friend, Joe, in high school and we were graduating high school in our senior  year.  He said, this is going to be the best year of our life.  And I didn't understand at the time, but he knew.  He just knew that it just gets so bad after high school for many, many years.  And then maybe some of this hope does turn around for you and you do become successful. 
[03:09:00]  It's something you want to get into or whatever.  But all these high school kids with the dreams of being the heart doctor and being an astronaut  and I'm going to be on the Olympic team.  And God bless you.  I think everyone should have dreams.  I certainly had my own dreams when I was growing up.  But the reality is, is what you just said, that there's going to be fucking hell in many  years where you don't even know where the fuck you're going in your life.  How are you going to pay your bills?  Another chick breaking your heart.  All this shit.  They have no idea in high school. 
[03:09:30]  It's all just, it's easy.  You know, they bitch about a test or something or writing a paper.  Who gives a shit?  That shit is easy compared to real life.  Here's the pain.  Deal with it.  Then you'll have hope.  Dude, people.  That's my point.  Then you'll have hope.  Not, you don't make it up as you, oh, it's going to be perfect.  I'm going to, the American dream.  The American dream is fucking, you work hard when you're young and then you spend the rest  of your life protecting your fucking money and then you die alone and your kids are home  managing their portfolios because that's what you taught them to fucking do to make money. 
[03:10:00]  You know, and it's all, and then some retarded guy with fucking down syndrome is happy every  day.  Hello.  Yeah.  Good morning.  It's good to see you.  Yeah.  They have no worries.  Right.  Because they're missing all this shit that makes the rest of us douchebags.  I learned that lesson a while ago.  I don't, I don't feel sorry for, for people like that whatsoever because they, they have  no clue.  They're just happy.  Ignorance.  They're happy in their fucking skin.  They're simple.  Dude, we had a guy that delivered mail at NAW.  I told you, I tell a story every once in a while, but it's one of my favorite stories 
[03:10:30]  and he, he, uh, he grew attached to me for whatever reason.  And, uh, one day.  I'm feeling that way too, though.  I feel that way too.  Well, Jimmy kind of brought up yesterday.  There is a, there is a sweetness to me that I don't allow it to come out often, but, uh,  he kind of, he kind of felt that maybe cause they have like that retard, like, uh, intuition  or, or an extra sense.  I don't know.  So, and people around the office, what was that?  Piece of paper.  Why?  I just flicked it.  I meant it to go over there and it just missed your head. 
[03:11:00]  Uh, people, uh, around the office, like you should take him to lunch.  Yeah.  Every, we take turns, take him to lunch.  So he feels part of like the workplace and stuff.  I'm like, how, how bad could this be?  I'll take him to lunch.  We'll talk about the Mets.  He's a Mets fan.  And we'll, and, and we'll, we'll make pictures with crayons on the fucking menus or whatever.  Right?  So we bring him down.  I bring him down to the Brooklyn diners, just me and him.  And, uh, the waitress comes over and she had big tits and the kid who doesn't look like  he's slow, by the way, is just staring at the tits to the point where I, I, I wanted 
[03:11:30]  to fucking hide because he doesn't understand to him.  It's tits and it's the greatest day of his life.  He's getting a free lunch and looking at tits and that's all he knew.  No manipulation.  He didn't try to manipulate.  The waitress is getting pissed, ready to tell this guy off.  And I'm just like, oh my God.  And I can't tell the waitress that he's a little slow and that's why he's looking at  your tits.  Hey, he's retarded, but leave him alone.  But getting back to your point, that's his life.  Yeah.  He's happy.  He's not worried about, you know, getting a promotion. 
[03:12:00]  He was happy delivering the mail, uh, all wrong, by the way, to the wrong mailboxes.  But you know, seeing tits for us isn't enough.  We have to tie her up, punch her in the back of the head.  You know, there's all kind of, we need extra shit.  It's not enough to just look at them and enjoy them.  But no, it's true.  Like they're very simple people, simple people.  Give chocolate milks the meaning of life.  Yeah.  He's fucking, you know.  And Craig from Scranton, PA.  Well, oh, what about you?  You made it, dude.  So why can't other kids dream too?  That's the only thing that keeps you going.  I said that we all should have dreams, but you should, there's a reality to it too. 
[03:12:30]  It's not as easy as you think it is when you're 17, 18, 19, 20 years old.  It's not about.  Dude, I've been doing radio since I was 18.  I was only successful seven years ago.  Right.  But you stood with it.  The point is these kids are walking around thinking it's all going to be great.  Well, the people that know my timeline and radio, I was in Buffalo doing overnights and  I moved home to Long Island to work at BAB, a place where I started interning.  I moved home from Buffalo with no fucking money in the bank whatsoever. 
[03:13:00]  I couldn't even pay the toll coming back over the bridge to Long Island.  I had to actually open up the back and find my change thing to pay the toll.  I had nothing.  And I was up there already in age.  You know, and then finally, then one thing after another, you know, worked out for me.  It's not, you know, it's like, but people will see that open, like be disconnected from  the reality of how you got to where you are. 
[03:13:30]  And the fact that you're still have unhappiness in your fucking life.  You're not perfectly happy.  Right.  It's not, life's not like that.  That's all I'm saying.  Get rid of that fucking horse shit and realize that there's struggles.  You know, you put a fucking iPod on and block it all out.  Look at an iPod.  No one's going to die.  People are still confused on instant feedback.  Yes, you should have the dreams, but there's a reality to it as well.  And you should be prepared for the reality and the hard work and a lot of disappointment. 
[03:14:00]  Most people don't make it because they get rejected or whatever.  And they're like, all right, I suck.  And they quit.  Right, right.  You know, that's when you should dig in harder and work harder at what you want to do.  Yeah, well, their parents are afraid of their own, their parents are afraid, so they make  them afraid by telling them how perfect they are.  You're special, Penelope.  Penelope, you're special.  You have a wonderful little white vagina.  It smells like lemon and coriander.  It's not dirty.  You're wonderful.  Then she's 25.  Someone lets her down and she goes to the hospital for fucking surgery to repair the fucking 
[03:14:30]  down.  You know what I mean?  This is all I'm saying.  This asshole's going to go, oh, you have to have dreams.  That's not what we're saying, you fucking jackass.  Just be prepared for the reality of it and how hard it really is.  You know.  Life is messy, man.  It's hard and messy.  It's not easy.  There's no overnight success story, though.  And the game plan doesn't, you can't make a game plan and then follow it and have it  work.  Yeah, right.  It falls apart somewhere.  You're not in control of it.  You get these obstacles thrown in there. 
[03:15:00]  I feel guilty because a lot of young guys come up to me and ask how they get into radio  and for many...  You pull your zipper down and then...  For many years, I would encourage them to get into it.  I think it was a great business.  Now, I almost feel bad that I'd tell these kids, don't go into it.  Do something else with your creativity because this business sucks.  Because you've been...  Although Satellite has brought back some of the excitement and I'm not just trying to  kiss XM's ass today, but they have.  But the business has changed in such a way, I'm like, why? 
[03:15:30]  Don't bother me.  I don't know if it's the same way with stand-up.  I have no idea if it's changed that much.  Very much so.  To me, stand-up is a way to make sense of all the shit that I've been through, to be  honest with you.  But the first time I ever got on stage was...  All right, let me just tell you one more sad thing and then I'll make it funny, I promise.  You haven't told us one sad thing yet.  No, all right.  My wife died in March of 95.  Now, I didn't even...  When my wife died, people said, what happened?  Did you fall apart?  No.  I didn't fucking even shed a tear.  Not because I'm tough, because my father, who I got close to over the years, had a brain 
[03:16:00]  tumor.  So I said, let me save it up.  I don't want to fall apart now.  Oh, wow.  My dad's going to die in a couple of months.  No, this is how human beings react.  You might have done it yourself in your life, where one bad thing happens to you.  You don't let yourself really experience it, because you're like, fuck, my mother's got  this issue, sickness.  My father died a few months later.  I got on a fucking plane from Florida to come to New York to bury my father.  When I was on the plane, I was done. 
[03:16:30]  I said, I'm done.  I was going to kill myself, but I wasn't angry.  I was at peace.  I was like, thank God, it's over.  I'm fucking done.  I land in New York, and I go to my father's funeral, and I had a fucking open mic night  scheduled in Florida the week later.  And I remember saying to myself, let me just do that fucking thing, then I'll kill myself.  Do a gig in Florida first?  It was my first time on stage.  That's how I had done it.  I never had felt that I booked a gig in Florida. 
[03:17:00]  Right, right.  No, it was in a bar.  It was just an open mic night.  Wait, how were you going to kill yourself?  Did you have it all figured out?  Let me tell you something.  Anybody, heroin, fuck you think.  They shoot themselves.  Have you heard of drugs, you asshole?  It's so simple.  Easy.  So you just did it.  I would have just done it.  Yeah, I would have just done it.  That's dope.  I'm making a point here, and the point is this, that I went and did the open mic night,  and my first joke, I'll never forget it, was about Guatemalans.  I still do it in my act now, because it was funny.  I said, look at these little fucking Guatemalans down here in Florida, because I'm from the 
[03:17:30]  Bronx.  We got Puerto Ricans.  These guys are like little brown Pokemon.  They're little tiny little midget.  Right.  It's a cute fight, but I got such a big laugh on it.  I don't know what I said for the next 10 minutes, but I finished my set, and I remember being  like, oh, fuck.  Yeah, I can.  There is something to live for.  There's something else.  There's comedy.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Then I went, and I was using drugs at the time, so I went to a Narcotics Anonymous convention  in Fort Lauderdale. 
[03:18:00]  Must get some good drugs at a place like that.  No, no, no.  I had four days off of the drugs, and I said, I'm going to try this one more time, this whole  getting off drugs thing and all this.  I go to the convention.  It's pouring rain.  So this guy was there.  He had a walkie-  So you got to do heroin.  I mean, the rain is depressing as shit.  He had a walkie-talkie.  You've been hurt, Opie.  Me?  You need therapy.  I think Jim's right.  Shut up with that mumbo-jumbo crap.  No, I'm kidding.  So there was this guy with a walkie-talkie in a bed, so I knew he was in charge of the 
[03:18:30]  NA thing.  So I said, dude, what's going on?  He said, it's raining.  We're supposed to have a pool party.  I said, there was a DJ and all this.  I go, well, look, I'm a stand-up comedian.  This is what happened.  I said, I'm a comedian.  He goes, really?  I go, yeah.  He goes, that's what you do professionally?  I go, yeah, bro.  I've been doing it for years.  I'm great.  I did one open mic.  So I said, I'll do a show for free.  I'll do a free show for everybody.  They brought everybody inside, set up a space for me, and I went up and I did an hour and 
[03:19:00]  ten minutes of just ranting and raving about how different the heroin is in Florida, how  they sell crack on bicycles.  They ride around selling crack.  Crack whores are chemically enhanced oral pleasure technicians.  I just came, I started coming up with all of this drug shit and pain, and it all came  out of me, and I killed.  I fucking killed.  And that was it.  That's, I found, that's what comedy is to me. 
[03:19:30]  That's what it means to me.  It's like a way for me to live with all of this pain.  Imagine if you would have bombed in Florida.  Oh, if I would have bombed, I wouldn't be here.  I would have killed myself.  But I literally killed, you know, I don't know what killed means.  It felt so good.  I made everybody laugh.  We joke about therapy a lot on the show lately, but this in a way is therapy that you're able  to turn on a mic and just rant and rave, you know?  Yeah, not, no.  It's not going to work.  Oh, yeah.  No.  Jimmy, I don't even know what he's talking about, but I know he's manipulating right now. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, he's trying to get me to agree that he doesn't need to go see Alan.  We have a good therapist.  He works for a lot of comics.  I don't see him.  I see his wife.  Oh, his wife.  His wife.  Even better.  Fuck that.  Oh, but you hang out with me.  We'll go do Buddhist meditation.  I'll straighten you out.  I'm a cutter.  When I cut, I'm...  Do you really?  No.  No.  I don't know.  I thought we were all being honest here.  I thought maybe you were telling us something true.  Therapy is very helpful, but urinating, when you've had to for 30 minutes, 
[03:20:30]  is also helpful.  Yeah, we've got to take a break.  So, I have to piss desperately.  Mike DiStefano.  Can I come back after the break?  Yeah, we've got to talk to a duty doctor.  He was scheduled about duty and shit.  I'm at the cellar a lot.  Duty and shit.  Oh, you don't have a gig coming up?  No, I was supposed to do some stuff at Caroline's.  I'm doing New Year's at Caroline's with Jimmy Florentine.  I thought you were going to promote Caroline's.  Florentine.  Yeah, for New Year's.  Okay.  Then promote that.  Oh, Mike DiStefano with Jim Florentine, who I love.  Jim's another guy who's been through a lot of shit, but he's a great fucking dude, 
[03:21:00]  you know?  We love Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course you do.  I don't know him too well.  I just think he's hysterical.  We don't give a shit.  He's on another show.  We love Jim Florentine.  We loved him for three years.  Yeah.  So, New Year's Eve, Caroline's with you and Jim Florentine.  That's a good gig right there.  Yeah, me and Florentine.  It's a very good gig.  And I'm working on some stuff right now, and I'm at the Comedy Cellar every night almost.  Esty puts me on.  She really loves me.  Let's take a break.  I'm going to piss my pants.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Ooh, let's continue.  Rob V from Patchogue says, sorry, Hope.  Anyone that has a fist fight with a Frenchman underwater is desperately in need of counseling. 
[03:21:30]  Have you ever done that?  A fist fight underwater with a Frenchman?  Did that really happen?  Yeah.  See, I don't...  It was slow motion fighting underwater.  With you?  60 to 7 feet underwater.  You did it?  Yeah.  Was it for a stunt or something?  Or was it really...  No!  You were snorkeling or something?  That pissed me off.  We were on the boat.  Underwater, yeah.  And we went out for a dive.  I was on vacation, and I did a few dives, but I was still paying attention to the instructor,  and this fucking asshole wasn't. 
[03:22:00]  And I got to the bottom fast, and here comes the guy, because he wasn't listening, and he  comes down way too fast, and he comes landing on top of me.  On top of you.  So we had a fight.  In the water down there?  Yes!  Good for you, buddy.  I don't see anything wrong with that.  All right, good.  You were expressing yourself.  Good.  Thank you.  That a boy.  I mean, I didn't get anything done, because you can't get footing, but we rolled around  a little bit, and then threw a couple punches, and then he broke us up, and then I was elbowing  him the rest of the dive.  Yeah.  Had a little fun with him.  What I should have done, if I had real balls, as soon as we got to the surface, I should have,  you know... 
[03:22:30]  Gets him on the fucking lips.  Yeah, I should have fucking...  I should have railed him on the boat with some nice footing, but I did not.  See, I tell you that side of the story, too.  I'm not the cool guy.  I'd wimp it out of the ass.  I'd love to tell people, when I got my ass kicked, it just never happened.  Really?  No.  It's by my father.  The only person who ever fucked me up.  I never had a broken nose.  Sounds like that was enough.  I don't think I ever had a bloody lip.  It's not because I'm tough.  I really...  I'm just...  I knew how to...  I was a young kid.  I was good at boxing.  That's hours of therapy right there.  I just never...  You know...  That's hours of therapy. 
[03:23:00]  I never was beat up, really.  I refused to lose another fight because of my dad.  Probably.  Yes.  All right.  We do have to leak.  All right.  So, New Year's Eve, Caroline's with Jim Florentine.  Mike DiStefano.  You got a website or anything, Mike?  Puppiesandheroin.com.  That's a good one, actually.  That should be you.  I swear to God.  It is.  Puppies and heroin.  P-U-P-P-I-E-S.  Get out of here.  That's hilarious.  P-U-P-P-I-E-S-A-N-D-H-E-R.  Puppiesandheroin.com.  And then Mike DiStefano, MySpace, whatever.  Nice.  All right.  We're going to get more rants out of Mike after the break. 
[03:23:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Dance party weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Comedy Gone Too Far.  Just when you thought the show couldn't get any better.  We got a really cool, funny guest coming up.  Oh, yeah, we do. 
[03:24:00]  We like this guy.  We got a kick out of this guy.  Well, Mike DiStefano in studio.  He's playing Caroline's New Year's Eve with Jim Florentine.  My ex-roommate, a man whose fucking giant testicles I've seen many times.  Is he really going out with Robin?  I talked to Jim again.  What can you say on this show about that?  Honestly, and I know Jim.  I don't want to break the bond of a close friendship.  Oh, no, no, no.  What the fuck's going on with that?  I would never throw Jim under the bus.  But Jim is the guy I get my friend.  I've known Jim since 1990.  And I'm like, come on, man.  Are you and Robin?  I'm like, I won't repeat on the air.  And he's like, nah, man. 
[03:24:30]  He's like, look.  I mean, we hung out a couple of times.  It's really cool.  I mean, you know, she's not a maniac in public.  I mean, she's really sweet.  Like, he was, I don't think he's banging her, to be honest with you.  But I think he does like her.  And I think he would have indicated to me.  He knows I would never throw him under the bus publicly.  I just wouldn't do it to Jim.  No, I'm not even asking for that.  No, no, no, I know.  I'm just curious because it's, you know.  But he knows that.  It made page six of the post.  And here and there, they're talking about how he's dating Robin Quivert.  Yeah, but no, no, he's really, he's like, look, she's really laid back, which I like.  Like, she's not fucking obsessive about calling me. 
[03:25:00]  You know, but she's like, it's just, you know, I don't know where it's going to go, to be honest with you.  I'd love to know.  Do you think, I don't want to put you in a bad spot.  Oh, I'll tell you anything you want to know.  But do you think he banged her?  No, I think he would have indicated if he did.  I think he kissed her.  I didn't ask him details.  What about, you know, blowjob?  Nah, I think he would have told me.  I think Jim would have told me.  I don't know if he would have.  He absolutely would have told me.  He would have let me smell his helmet.  We're very close.  You think he fucked her mouth?  No, I don't think he fucked her at all, actually. 
[03:25:30]  I don't think so.  I don't, I don't personally, I don't know.  I've never met her.  I don't think that she would just bang a comic immediately.  I just doesn't, you know what I mean?  It's like, you just can't.  That whole thing is interesting.  I know.  When I'm hearing about that, I'm like.  I know.  It's because we all know Jimmy.  All right.  That'd be a fun wedding to go to.  I'd fucking absolutely go to that.  Oh, geez.  One side and the other side, looking at each other.  I like how the merge is going to be handled.  One side and the other side.  We'll sit on this side of the room.  You sit over here. 
[03:26:00]  And we will not be meeting on the dance floor.  Hey, we got to say hi to Dr. Doody, man.  He's a friend of the show.  And a very funny man.  He loves shit.  Dr. Doody.  Dr. Doody.  Good morning.  Good morning.  How's everybody's colon doing this morning?  Ah, good.  Hey, sorry we had to push you off a little bit.  We got backed up before.  I know.  You got backed up.  My favorite kind of crap to talk about.  I get it.  Dr. Doody's full of Doody jokes. 
[03:26:30]  You got to talk about crap and you expect it not to be a little funny, right?  Yeah, of course.  It's the nature of it.  Right, Doc?  That's right.  By the way, I got to start off.  You got a picture on your website.  I just absolutely love.  It's number 117.  It looks like, if you look at it really, really kinky-wise, I guess I call it kinky  is a good word.  It looks like a picture of a grumpy old fart.  It's got the little eyes, little nose, little grumpy.  Of course, he's talking about the pictures of the shit that people have sent in.  RateYourDuty.com. 
[03:27:00]  Unbelievable.  RateYourDuty.com.  Wait, this picture we're looking at now looks like there's a lot of toilet paper in the  bowl.  I think it means it's crinkled up in the middle.  See the eyes, the nose, a little straight kind of clinky mouth?  No, but you do with shit what I do with cumulus clouds.  Wait, hold on, Doc.  I'm not seeing it now.  Paint the picture for me.  Which, which, uh...  Yeah.  Tilt your head to the right.  All right.  Fuck.  You'll see, like, two little eyes, a little kind of nose, and then a little mouth, a squiggly 
[03:27:30]  mouth.  I think right here.  I'm not seeing it.  No, I still see shit.  Oh, yeah.  Ah, the old man.  I do see it.  The old man.  There you go.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's see.  Where is it, Jimmy?  Watch out there.  Eye, nose, eye, little mouth.  Little mouth.  Oh, yes.  He does look like a little grumpy old...  Jesus Christ.  That's insane.  I see it, too.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you make t-shirts, Dr. Doody?  Doc, it's like the shit of Turin.  He sees faces and shit, and he worships them. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, so, Doc, all kid in his side, how goes it?  You know, it's been a while.  Low and proud, you know what I mean?  Low and proud, I hear you.  This guy's out of his mind, incorrigible.  So, Doc, walk us through it.  You know, I've got to tell you, the pictures were amazing and disgusting, all the ones,  and I kind of like both ends of the spectrum.  Yeah.  You know, we talk, I talk, at least, all the time about, you know, trying to clean  out the digestive system, the 27 feet of intestinal tract, and all the chemicals, pesticides. 
[03:28:30]  That's why you're always asked to parties.  Enough of the serious stuff, right?  I mean, there are...  I've got to tell you, there's one that I just was absolutely...  Why would you not go to the hospital, like, immediately?  Number 63?  Hold on, Doc.  Let us get there.  You're two steps ahead, as usual.  Man, I'm telling you.  RateYourDuty.com.  We've got to go to page...  Picture 63.  That's the one.  It looks like somebody, uh, somebody kind of shed a Roman candle.  It's just like this red stuff.  Oh, God.  Hold on, Doc.  Let me paint the picture. 
[03:29:00]  We're, uh, we got a nice log.  There's a black tip, which never indicates cancer, and there's, uh, some red stuff, which,  uh, I don't know.  It's like a 10-pound duty fell out of a one-pound asshole.  Am I right or wrong, Doc?  Well, wait a minute.  Dr. Doody thinks that this person might have a medical problem.  What?  Hold on!  Let me tell you something.  What I'm looking at is a lot of yellow in the bowl, so the dude had a lot of vitamins  that morning, and then he got a little blood around the doody, but what if he was just  taking a shit on top of his girl, uh, having her period?  Atta boy, oh.  Thank you, Jimmy. 
[03:29:30]  That would make sure it's better, but look how dark red it is in parts of it.  Yep, that's right.  Very dark red.  And the dark red is actually bleeding from inside.  Yep.  That's a bad thing.  That certainly is.  When a log is bloody, it's always a mess.  And you see that black tip sticking out, Doc?  What's your thoughts?  That's what I'm talking about.  That little black tip is actually dark blood.  Absolutely.  It looks like a little hat.  Red is fresh blood from usually a hemorrhoid condition, et cetera.  That's years of abuse.  Absolutely.  You're trying to force yourself to have elimination.  Go to the doctor now.  Yep.  Hey, uh, that a boy, Doc. 
[03:30:00]  Doc, uh, a couple issues, uh, with me, uh, Opie.  Um, my farts are horrendous lately.  Doc, guys, reach out for help.  What do you got?  Huh?  Are you bragging?  I'm having a problem.  They're horrendous.  They're like, uh, gasoline farts.  Like, uh, uh, they're just horrific.  Really bad.  You know, this time of year, you know, Thanksgiving just passed.  It is.  It is.  It is the season to overindulge, as we kind of call it.  You're not kidding, Doc.  A lot of oils. 
[03:30:30]  You saw a lot of the pictures.  Well, you guys have seen them.  If the folks out there, if you're looking at the pictures, you see a lot of pictures  with really oily, slimy eliminations, you know?  Sure.  They go dumps with oil all over it.  Well, I hasn't seen many of those photos.  Literally, you know, too much overindulgence.  Yep.  You know, I talk about this, you know, this Alloese program talking about cleaning out the  digestive system.  I will tell you, I encourage the following.  You get a couple people on this colon and body cleanse program, the Alloese, and the 
[03:31:00]  first time they have a one, two, three, four, up to five foot long elimination, they'll  set a record in your picture.  Five foot long elimination.  Five feet.  I'm telling you, so help me goodness now.  I'm not trying to scare you.  I don't know.  I keep going at it.  Wait, but is it in one piece?  One smooth, long, gated elimination.  I had a two-footer.  I had two footer.  I just was bragging about my two-footer a mere week ago.  Doc, I'd love to drop one of those to show my friends, my family.  What do I do?  Go.  Let me tell you something.  If they call the 1-800-CLINSE number, you know, 1-800-253-2673, enough trying to 
[03:31:30]  brag about all the numbers, but the 2-5-3-2-6-7-3-800 number, they will get an  opportunity to get a colon cleanse.  Give out that number, Doc.  Let them all hear it.  You guys, my way of saying thanks for the holiday season.  What's the number, Doc?  1-800.  1-8-2-5-3-2-5-3-6-7-3.  2-6-7-3.  Just think it that way.  1-800-CLINSE.  1-800-CLINSE.  1-800-CLINSE.  2-5-8.  Now, Opie, I've got to send you one of these programs. 
[03:32:00]  You've got to at least promise me to try me on for size.  The worst it can do is make you disappear.  And no matter what Mike said about you, you're not that full of it.  I'm sick of that.  Come on, Doc.  Easy now.  Don't love it.  You get it?  Full of it.  What are you trying to do here?  No, I won't try this program.  In fact, you know, opium.  No, I won't unless you pay me.  Well, you know what?  I'll tell you what.  I'll pay you back with a following. 
[03:32:30]  I promise you.  Well, with a shit hat.  You're going to have better health.  You're going to look better.  You know, perfection's harder.  How about feeling better, Doc?  Let's go there for a minute.  Doc, you don't understand what you just said.  I am so good looking that I don't need to look better.  I'm trying to look worse so I fit in with the average human being.  The average Joe.  The God among men, Doc.  What do you got for that?  He can't shit in public.  People eat it just to be him.  I hold in my shit so I look a little toxic, so I look like a normal human being.  Absolutely.  If you shit blood red, we'd all rub it on our faces like war paint. 
[03:33:00]  That's right, sir.  Go ahead, Doc.  It's your turn.  You go.  I'm a 10.  I'm a 10.  I hold the shit in.  I'm down to a 9.  Absolutely.  What do you got?  We don't be turtles.  We're fucking Pied Piper.  People follow it.  That mouth is open.  We'll get you guys so cleaned out that it'll almost scare living daylights out of you.  By the way, you didn't answer my smelly fart question.  What is that?  Too much fiber?  What do you know?  Thanksgiving.  Too much chemical, pesticide, and preservatives.  It's better to digest the system.  Block the ability to absorb nutrition.  The gallbladder and liver produce a lot of acid. 
[03:33:30]  They try to break down the food, give you a lot of gas, indigestion.  Acid, indigestion, et cetera.  That sounds like you're guessing.  You need to take the program to get the stuff out of your system to allow better health.  No matter how good or bad you look, you want to do one thing, live in the best you can.  Be healthy.  Sure do, Doc.  From your lips to God's ears.  Doc, what do you got on seepage?  Ass seepage.  Well, ass seepage, again, is the problem.  You got 27 feet of intestinal tract.  A little pouch below the belly.  Wait, can you say that again, Doc, in case anybody missed it? 
[03:34:00]  Can you say that again, please?  Slow.  27 feet of intestinal tract.  Right-a-boy, 27 feet.  20 feet of small intestine, approximately 7 feet of large intestine.  All right, 27 total.  Total, total.  The problem with seepage is that you have no way to hold back the elimination process.  Right.  Because the chemicals, pesticides, and preservatives are not allowing for absorbent nutrition.  Right.  And that toxic waste dump is just literally going right through you.  Seepage is a very, very common problem.  Sure is.  You don't have a proper elimination process going on.  Doc, so seepage is like gravity taking its toll and there's stuff slowly coming out of you. 
[03:34:30]  Absolutely.  Now, it happens when I have a lot of sushi and too much wasabi.  It leaves what can only be described as like a butterscotch type of substance in my underpants.  God damn.  I'm throwing out underwear pretty much on a daily basis.  What can I do?  Again.  He throws out underwear like you throw out puns.  All kidding aside, Doc.  I was going to help you out a little bit.  You know, the lettuce and vegetables and all.  Well, you know, all the wonderful stuff you don't like to have.  I love my veggies.  Doc, I love my veggies. 
[03:35:00]  I understood.  There you go.  Allow the Aloys program.  Take a couple of tablets twice a day.  No.  That's what you've got to do.  Don't have to take the powder because the powder's got to, well, how do you explain?  Not a really delicious taste.  Maybe God awful would be a better terminology, but it looks very well.  Probably would be.  The tablets you can take, you know, a couple in the morning, a couple at night.  Time you on for size.  What do you got to lose?  We're looking at the.  Hold on, Doc.  Hold on, Doc.  We're looking at Rate Your Duty.  The Loch Ness Log.  That is a real close-up shot. 
[03:35:30]  It almost looks like the great white shark coming at the cage when Hooper was in there.  It's number 62 for reference.  Number 62, if you're following along at home, rateyourduty.com.  Yeah, number 62.  Number 62.  It's going into the abyss.  Yeah.  It looks like it's actually on the inside, doesn't it?  Yeah, it sure does.  It's still a stone-sized hat coming out.  Yeah, I feel like I'm a piece of algae floating with it, looking at it on the way out.  Dr. Doody, one more thing.  It's a sucker fish on the outside of it.  Dr. Doody, this Sunday, I got very embarrassed by my fiancee. 
[03:36:00]  I had the Philly crew up.  We're watching football.  And I kept getting up off the couch, and there was an odor.  And I'm thinking that one of these idiots from Philly is farting on my brand-new couch  while we're watching the football game.  And then one of them accused me of farting.  I said, I ain't fucking farting.  It's you that's farting.  Anyway, they go home back to Philly, and my fiancee has to break it to me that I got smelly sweatpants.  Go.  What can I do about that problem?  Well, first off, throw the damn things away. 
[03:36:30]  Is that one of those things, right, Doc?  Was that a joke?  Who could tell?  I don't know.  I give them credit for one.  Well, I tell you what.  Number 70, if you look at the numbers, I love when someone takes a tape measure, a little  yard, a one-foot, you know, little measure device, right?  And the measure is like, you know, hey, look at the seven, eight inches.  Wow.  Let me tell you something, okay?  Go ahead, Doc.  I'll tell you.  Do you know what number 70 is?  I want them to get this Aloe's program.  The first time they have a, you know, like I said, one, two, three, four, five-footer, 
[03:37:00]  try to measure that one.  You've got to get a tape measure inside and kind of bend it around and bend it around.  How do you take a five-foot dump and not end up with it on your ass cheeks?  I'll tell you.  You've got to have somebody hold it like one of those snakes in a photo.  You ever do that, Doc?  Like an anaconda.  Just for shits and giggles, you know, to go to your school.  Hey, Doc, all kidding aside, how long would it take me on the Aloe's program?  Let's just say I joined up, and how long would it take me to start firing out these things  you're claiming?  Well, two, within two weeks.  For the doubting Thomases out there.  Within two weeks, you're going to be so regular. 
[03:37:30]  You set your clock to it.  Oh, wow.  What a way to wake up, huh?  I've done an amazing job.  After 30 days, you can see this light brown turned to dark brown turned to black tar solution.  Looks like nasty, god-awful.  How in the hell could that be inside of my anus?  Heck, heck, Doc.  Keep it to heck.  It will indeed scare the living, you know what, out of you.  I've got to tell you, my wife and I have been married 26 years.  God bless.  God bless.  My wife and I have been married 26 years.  Look at the beef still.  What number is that?  71.  71.  71 going up. 
[03:38:00]  Hold on a second.  We're looking at Zapruder film footage.  Hey, Dr. Duty, before we continue, when is our cocaine going to arrive for this plug-over?  I will send out your, if you want to call it cocaine, it's okay.  I've been calling all kinds of stuff.  I'll send out your Alois stuff like right now.  Hold on.  I'm looking at a brown game hen.  I want to eat that fucker.  That looks delicious.  Pardon my French, Doc.  The guy's show for guys.  So let's just say, how do I go to the Alois program?  1-800-CLEANSE. 
[03:38:30]  1-800-253-2673.  Now the Alois program comes.  I'm a regular Joe.  What do I do?  You know, nice and easy.  You have it in powder form or tablet form?  Powder form, reasonably powder form.  And what, do you pound that up your ass?  Well, just about.  The powder really breaks down.  You know, it's already broken down.  Go back.  It has a lot better results faster.  Well, let's do the powder now.  What do you mix that up with?  The only thing I can mix it up with is some kind of a juice.  Two ounces of juice.  Wait, wait.  Two teaspoons in the juice.  This looks like a mama bear with her little cub on her shoulder. 
[03:39:00]  You got her a brown Joshua tree.  What number are you guys on?  77.  77.  77.  We're all clicking and laughing together, Doc.  That's what this is about.  Just laughing at the duties.  Hey, Doc, are you a big fan of the hose up your ass?  You know, here's the problem with the hose up your ass, colonics.  It goes up there and does a great job.  The problem is you don't get any money for that, right?  Yep.  Three to seven feet of your intestine cracker cleans out.  How about you at 27 feet of intestine?  Wow, yeah.  20 plus seven like we talked about earlier. 
[03:39:30]  So is it possible, theoretically, to take a 27 foot shit?  No.  But again, you basically eat food.  Disappointment.  First, 20 feet's a small intestine.  That's where you absorb your nutrition.  95% of what you eat is absorbed in the 20 feet of intestinal tract.  The seven feet of intestinal tract, the large intestine, is where you store your elimination.  So in theory, it should be quite easy to have a three, four, five, six, up to seven foot long elimination.  Seven feet long.  Well, let's, Doc, let's sexy this up a little bit. 
[03:40:00]  Let's just say I start taking the pills.  How long until I drop an elimination like that as opposed to the powder?  If let's just say I'm more inclined to take pills.  What would your theory on that?  The pills are going to take you a little longer, probably two weeks additional.  But the first, you've got a 90-day program.  This sounds crazy.  90 days.  I know, right?  What am I going to do for 90 days, right?  It's like, whoa, whoa, 90 days.  Three months.  Hey.  Hey.  I'll kick the shit out of you.  Here's one thing you guys are going to like about this.  The little pouch below the belly.  You've all seen the little pouch.  You've got a little pouch down there. 
[03:40:30]  Sure, we've all got a little pouch, Doc.  Looks like an AIDS ribbon.  Okay, come on.  Fucking shit ribbon.  The pouch will go away.  That's your 27 feet.  By the way, Doc, let's point out you have a bigger pouch than most of us.  All right.  If we're going to be honest there.  Good living, Doc.  Hope you're not eating your product.  So what's that pouch?  Punch, punch, punch, punch, punch.  According to the Food and Drug Administration, that's 5 to 22 pounds of chemicals, pesticides,  and preservatives on the inside of your 27 feet of intestinal.  How the hell did that get there, Doc? 
[03:41:00]  Every day we eat food that's filled full of chemicals, pesticides, and preservatives,  and they start to cling the intestinal tract.  How the hell does it come out?  If you doubt me for a second, if you've been around kids between 6 and 12 years of age...  Who hasn't been?  They go to the bathroom, right?  They want to leave us a little present, they forget to flush.  You go inside, they go, goodness sakes, how can something that big come out of someone  that small?  How can something that big go in something that small?  I promise you, it is supposed to be silver dollar diameter, 8 to 14 inches in length every 
[03:41:30]  day.  Are those what yours are like, Doc?  I'm sorry?  Are those what yours are like?  I tell you what, I have the best...  I should send my pictures to you guys.  You sure should.  I don't have a silver dollar.  What if they come out four quarters?  That's right.  You know, four quarters is good enough for me.  That's right.  Or how about 250?  I'm sure.  It looks like a rolled up buck.  We'll give us a change of that.  Doc, if you have a shit fetish...  I'm anal retentive.  Super shit.  Anal retentive.  Hold on.  And you want a girl that's shit on your chest.  What diet would you suggest she eats? 
[03:42:00]  All they've got to do is take lots and lots and lots and lots of oily, greasy food, and  they'll come out.  Hot, spicy food, and it'll make you a nice little platter.  And you'll get a fine hot Carl.  There you go.  Hey, we want to show you something now.  I mean, he's a shit doctor.  Two girls, one cup.  Is it real or fake?  Have you seen this video yet?  Doc laughs at this.  I have not.  You haven't seen this yet?  What's the website?  Are you on your computer there, Doc?  I am indeed.  By the way, do you talk about anything else besides shit? 
[03:42:30]  I do.  All right.  I talk about my...  Not in the same breath.  I talk about my wife quite a bit, especially when she takes a big, long dump, and she calls  me, honey, honey, come quick, come quick.  Sure.  It looks like an anaconda came out of her ass.  Wow.  What's that you want to share with me on that, honey?  Ah, those are the moments.  Yeah, let's...  All right, Doc.  Go to twogirlsonecup.com.  The number two or just two T.W.O.?  Good question, Doc.  Good question.  Numbers both times, Doc.  Yep.  Both times.  Two girls?  Two girls, one cup.  Two girls, one cup.  Dot com.  Sit back and enjoy. 
[03:43:00]  You're Dr. Duty.  I want to get your...  This is going to be masterpiece theater to you.  Your thoughts on this video.  Are you there?  I'm here.  All right, push play.  Okay, safety alert.  Yeah, whatever.  Okay, fine.  It's like a family outing.  You're going to laugh at this.  All right, tell me when you're seeing...  You're seeing the lesbianism?  Oh, yeah.  Now you see that?  There you go.  Yeah, see, it doesn't face him.  This kid's unbeatable.  What do you see?  It's not running up.  My computer hates me.  It sucks.  You are...  You're scared of viruses, Doc. 
[03:43:30]  Two girls, one cup.  Let's go.  I don't know how the hell to go around it.  It's absolutely driving me crazy.  We hang up in three?  No, don't hang up.  I love you guys.  Then push play.  Stop being a wimp with your computer.  I'm trying to...  I'm so confused.  No viruses on this.  Let's go.  Twogirlsonecup.com.  This is part of pop culture at this point.  Yep.  Two girls, one cup.  Doc, how do you not enjoy that?  Are people saying this is not real?  Oh, no.  We all think it's real.  We just want the doctor to watch it.  I don't think it's real anymore.  All my computer says is AOL Safedular. 
[03:44:00]  What the hell is that supposed to be?  Oh, you know what?  His computer stuff is stepping in the way.  That happens.  AOL?  Yeah.  You got to take that silly...  You don't let AOL filter anything.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, right?  What is that?  An age filter?  If it's the last thing I do, dammit, I will find this at this site and I will play it  today.  I promise.  All right.  Cool.  So let's discuss the product a little more.  Tell us a little something else about it, Doc.  Let me tell you about the product.  Give us the scenario.  What color are the pills?  I mean, we've talked about everything else. 
[03:44:30]  Kind of a nice little smooth brown.  Very nice.  Atta boy.  Regular guy like me.  Hold on, Doc.  Doc, if I could.  Regular Joe like me.  Now, I have a bunch of pounds in my paunch.  Is that true?  Say goodbye.  They will literally lose 5 to 18 pounds of not fat, not muscle, chemicals, pesticides,  and preserves.  I hope not, muscle.  The bottom line to me is trying to remove all the chemicals you digest.  Hold on a second.  I'm looking at some shit photographed under a microscope.  It's like pretzel rods.  It looks like a sand dollar. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, there's some weird pictures on rateyourduty.com.  Would you agree, Doc?  Oh, yeah.  99, Doc, if you want to look.  Rate your duty is an odd one, isn't it, Doc?  You know, it's just, this whole thing, it just always amazed me that first off, people  would even be willing to take a picture of the elimination.  And 99 looks like it.  Elimination?  That came out of my ass?  Your shit?  I want to know, what the hell's going on?  Yep.  Doc.  Why am I having these little pelts come out of there?  It's just, I mean.  According to you, it should be the size of a truck tire. 
[03:45:30]  It should be a firestorm.  Look at number 92.  I love 92.  Doc.  Where's the picture of your shit?  I tell you what, I'm going to get one of you guys.  I will blow you guys away in this.  You want 92?  What's a good 92?  You do know we're shock jocks.  I love it.  Oh, God, that's some kind of sea life.  92 looks like, to me, like it's hours upon hours upon hours to try to, you know, pinch  and squeeze.  Sure, pinch and squeeze, no good.  That's an old school method.  No, no, no.  What, are we living on a prairie in 1700?  That's mints.  Pinch and squeeze is old hat.  It looks like a blooming onion. 
[03:46:00]  It's old hat, Doc.  Oh, my God.  What else is there to say about this?  We even asked you the color of the pills.  What else can we ask?  31 different herbs.  How many pills are in a bottle there, Doc?  180.  180.  Pinch and squeeze.  Pinch and squeeze.  All right, we got a couple numbers we want you to, oh, shut up already.  We got a couple numbers we want you to review.  What number?  Let's start with Travis's first, 113.  113.  That's right. 
[03:46:30]  Travis actually shit a marsupial.  113 is a typical elephant tusk.  It's hiding.  Starts off big and just squeezes on down slower and slower and slower until it looks like a  little elephant tusk.  Doc, can you tell, Doc, can you tell if a guy tells you what?  He's taken up the ass by the shit that is left behind.  That's right.  Because this looks a little too.  Are you sure, though?  That looks a little too wide right there.  Yeah.  That's a healthy one?  How about that one?  Is that a healthy one?  That curly Q one?  The curly Q is not bad.  But again, you can tell that his large intestine is not the same. 
[03:47:00]  It's the same size from start to finish large intestine.  That's what we don't like about him.  It should be the same size.  It's not supposed to be a little healthy.  It's a sign of weakness.  It's not healthy.  Yeah, I can't commit to nothing.  When I first saw that fucking guy, I knew.  You just can tell.  This guy, he's a one-thickness-intestine kid.  We don't like him around here.  We don't need his kind.  Who is this, Danny?  No, this is more Travis.  All right, more Travis.  A deer broke in and shit in his toilet.  What number is this?  114.  114, Doc.  Let's go. 
[03:47:30]  What did you eat?  I don't know.  This was an abnormal one.  That's why I took the sugar.  It certainly was.  Yeah, abnormal to say the least.  Looks like he had a bunch of peanuts and maybe a big healthy drink of Casper oil.  And broken anal beads.  Just broke it on.  It had little anal beads come out there.  Next time, you should chew his penis a little better than what he had.  Either that or corn or whatever.  It looks like...  Fucking ball bearings.  He ate a box of beebees.  It looks like someone dumped a bowl of honey smacks into the toilet.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:48:00]  Either that or some of bees flying out of the toilet.  You guys still talk to Pat, who the competitive eater was?  Non-stop.  We'll ask the questions.  Doc.  Yeah.  Before he died.  I'm the CSI of shit.  That last picture looks like Travis just went to the movies the night before.  A little Raisinettes.  Yeah, you're exactly right.  Let's get some more opinions from the doc.  You're kind of coinciding with what we've theorized about, Doc.  So you're backing us all up whether you mean to or not.  Right.  What's the next picture we're going to?  Last Travis one is 115.  115, Doc.  What do you think? 
[03:48:30]  I think 115 looks like he had a nightmare.  Look how skinny they are.  I know.  It's the first thing I thought.  It's a teeny tiny push.  A lot of coming out.  Yeah.  And that's the, you know, say to the least, a lot of the intestinal tract, it looks like  probably, I'm guessing, two feet, maybe longer.  Why is it so skinny?  Yeah, why?  Because, understand, every day you eat food, and the chemicals that are designed to keep  the food safe for us to consume, trap themselves on the line themselves in the intestinal tract.  Which, how do you make the tract thinner? 
[03:49:00]  Am I right or wrong?  Correct.  All right, I'm walking with you here.  Go ahead.  And that's where you have that five to 22 pounds of chemicals inside your digestive system.  All right.  And one, if you absorb 95% of what you absorb is absorbed in the intestinal tract, if the  chemicals, pesticide, and preservatives block the ability to absorb nutrition, what you're  trying to do is you're just going right through you, not absorbing nutrition, not feeling good,  you feel run down.  All right.  It's just not a good problem.  Doc, you're speaking great to me.  You're shitting me.  Get out of here.  Doc, what did you want to become before you decided to become a shit doctor? 
[03:49:30]  You know, I guess the whole thing, every guy's thinking of a gynecologist versus a, you know.  Oh, the stealth.  Can't be able to get fired if we're eating on the job.  Get out of here.  Get a little far away, you know.  You're incorrigible.  Hey, what number is that?  I want to get the doc's opinion.  We have a hotel insignia here.  What number is this?  112, Doc.  112.  Oh, my God.  It's that funny.  What do you know?  Looks like the Marriott upside down. 
[03:50:00]  Where are the W?  You know, whatever you want.  Or how about the number three hotel with the E, Doc?  Whatever.  McShittles.  As crazy as that sounds, that's what a elimination should look like somewhat, but a little larger in diameter.  Absolutely.  It's got the texture to it.  Sure does.  How about the color, Doc?  Is that a good color?  The color's a good color.  What's a good color for your shit?  Brown.  You don't want to see the dark red or the light red.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, but the problem is this kid... 
[03:50:30]  However, this is fun if you guys want to have fun.  Drink a lot of the purple Gatorade or the green Gatorade and watch your eliminations look green or yellow.  I've never heard fun described like that, Doc.  That's fun with a capital F.  You must be a ride out of party.  Jesus.  Die.  Hey, look at my shit.  It looks like it's a Martian.  Hey, you get all your friends and everybody laughs.  Wow.  You're laughing at your Martian shit.  Hey, guys, you're not going to believe this.  Whoa, watch out. 
[03:51:00]  I'm crazy.  I think this is what Orson Welles showed people in the 30s, and they killed themselves.  So, all right.  So, that's a healthy one, the M.  Very good.  I'll go with your joke.  Let's get another one in.  Yeah, let's get the Doc's opinion.  One more?  You're backing up a lot of what we already said.  One more are we done?  That's it.  Oh, we got to go with one more.  All right, that's it.  Hold on, Doc.  We found it random.  That's the Firefox one.  Fire.  Oh, hi, right.  We want to get your opinion on one more.  So, Doc, you suggest more people put their shits up on RateYourDuty.com?  Absolutely.  You know what I want to challenge everybody is to take the Aloyses. 
[03:51:30]  No.  Give me two, three, four weeks, and then start posting your pictures, and keep them posting  as they get larger, and longer, and bigger, and healthier.  That's kind of like a construction project.  You can pretty much watch it from the ground up.  That's right.  Someone's writing, it looks like a coat of arms.  That's very good.  Oh, cigars and scotch again.  Hey, show, Doc, which is the family crest.  That's what it looks like.  96, Doc.  96, Doc.  Doc, if I take the Aloyses tonight, when do I get these big duties? 
[03:52:00]  Now, do you see how large the large part is?  Sure do.  And then it's got the little S behind it?  Yep.  That's the problem.  That's how it completely...  The lighter part of the intestinal tract, the one you're forcing out, is large, then  the rest of it coming out is like this little, slimy little piece.  So what that means is, Doc, hold on, let me theorize, let me theorize, let me see if  I got it.  Now, hold on.  I'm a regular Joe.  You're speaking Greek to me here, Doc.  Let's just say the big piece comes out, and that little slimy piece, who's up to no  good, is this little slimy piece, because of all the FDA stuff, the rest of it's getting 
[03:52:30]  trapped around the intestinal wall, so it's not all coming out.  I mean, Dan, you are good.  That's what I'm trying to say.  You're speaking my language.  You are eloquent, to say the least.  You're dead on.  Hey, we got the Grim Reaper's sickle here.  I'd like you to take a look at this one.  You know shit.  You know shit.  You know shit, Bill.  There we go.  What are you trying to do here?  So which number is this?  I want the Doc's opinion here.  57.  If you see a guy with a big black cape, but he's holding this in his right hand, does  it mean you're dead?  Doc, your opinion.  Let me tell you a second.  You see the foam?  You see the little... 
[03:53:00]  Quick, Doc, come on.  We move fast here.  Yeah, the mucus on there is not a healthy thing.  The darker color, the smaller part, that's up further inside the intestinal tract.  Right.  The lighter color is coming out first.  Bigger around.  As it comes around, it gets darker and darker.  Yeah.  That's a problem inside his intestinal tract.  He has a serious problem of absorption and nutrition.  What are those two white things in there?  That looks like some kind of a mucus inside there.  He's got some kind of an infection.  Come.  Yeah, it looks like sperm, Doc.  Let's be honest with each other here.  Let's see.  Either that or eat a lot of chicklets. 
[03:53:30]  Exactly.  Kidding, Doc, of course.  You shouldn't make light of it.  I like getting the one with all the oil on them.  They just look absolutely disgusting.  It's just way too much spicy food and way too much greasy food.  All right.  Well, we've got to run, Doc.  We've got to run.  What's in that diarrhea?  Come on.  Get out.  You get any work done.  Hey, Doc.  Hey, Doc, how's the sex life?  Wife good?  Let me tell you something.  One of the things I brag about with Aloys is that it will put lead in your pencil, and that  you can take to the bank.  Oh, what do you mean by that?  I can sign my check with it right there at the window. 
[03:54:00]  Sounds like this Aloys does everything.  My God.  Does it drive your car, Doc?  Go.  Get rid of the chemicals out of your body.  That's right.  More lead in the pencil.  And to say the least, everything gets turned on.  I mean, literally from your brain to your prostate and everywhere in between.  You need to put more sticky in your color forms.  Am I right or wrong, Doc?  Let's go to Sean in Pennsylvania.  Sean.  Hey, Doc.  How you doing?  Hey, I tried this, man.  I used to be like a soft ice cream maker for like a week. 
[03:54:30]  Doc?  Hey there, Doc.  Oh, I might have hung up on Doc to take Sean's phone call.  Oh, that's a shame.  Doc, you done talking shit?  All right, hold on.  I think we got him back.  Doc, you're on with...  It's okay to hang up on me.  I understand.  You don't love me no more.  Oh, we love you, Doc.  You have a shitty reception.  It's all my heart.  It's all my heart.  It's a shitty deal, but I'm glad you have a chance to say that.  Okay.  No, we love you, Doc.  We wouldn't crap on you like that.  Let's bring it back down to reality here, Doc. 
[03:55:00]  Let's keep it serious.  What's going on?  Yeah.  Sean, you're on with Dr. Loren.  Dr. Doody.  Oh.  Dr. Doody.  Hey, Doc.  My friend told me about this like three years ago.  I tried it.  I did it like a soft ice cream maker for like a week.  It was good, actually.  I clogged the toilet, and then I had to clean it.  That was bad.  That sure was.  There ain't nothing wrong with cleaning all that crap about it, especially when it comes  out of your ass.  I'm not being bad.  Don't take it wrong.  I'm not sure to see a lot of stuff come out of my... 
[03:55:30]  And then to go in the bathroom...  Come on, Doc.  Slow down.  You're panicking.  I'm just not liking all this shit inside your body.  You're tripping all over yourself to get to it.  Relax.  Baby steps.  We're not going to hang up on you again, buddy.  You're good, Doc.  Say that one again a little slower so we can all enjoy it like a fine wine.  What's that?  I'd much rather have all this junk come out of my body and go in the toilet where it  belongs.  That a boy.  You will see this light brown, dark brown, black tar come out of your bowels with aloes.  And as disgusting maybe as it may be, what's disgusting is that you have it in your body 
[03:56:00]  and you don't even know it's there.  To begin with.  Doc.  Doc.  Yes.  We get it.  You love shit.  I love shit.  I live for shit.  I think he likes shit.  He sure does, Jimmy.  I don't think he likes shit.  I think he loves it.  That's right.  This man's never met a log he didn't like.  When you see dog shit in the middle of the yard, I bet you move it out of the way to  protect it.  I'll tell you one thing.  Endangered species.  I'll tell you one thing about that.  Endangered feces. 
[03:56:30]  I'll tell you one thing about Dr. Judy.  He's not full of shit.  No.  No.  He won't give you any crap.  Dr. Judy, you're incorrigible.  Oh, he'll give you crap, but it'll be a good thing.  Oh, jeez.  Dr. Judy, you got verbal diarrhea.  Diarrhea of the mouth.  Oh, hey, shit.  All right, so, Doc, you got any last minute advice as we wrap this up here?  We want to give you a nice plug.  1-800-CLEANSE, of course.  A regular Joe, like me, wants to take the product.  What do you got for us? 
[03:57:00]  Nice and easy.  Right.  If they call up the 1-800-253-2673 number.  We're 1-800-CLEANSE, but if it's easier for you to remember the numbers, you throw them  right out.  I'm going to give them a free gift this time of year, but more importantly to me.  What are you going to give them, Doc?  A ribbon to tie around that 10-foot shit?  A nice ribbon.  I'll keep that a little bit.  Get with your ex-wife.  Here you go, honey.  Before I get off the air, to each number one of you guys.  You should mount shit and make trophies out of it.  Yes.  Make a big shit-skin rug.  Let people make love on it.  They were fireflies. 
[03:57:30]  Lacquerette.  So, Doc, what kind of gifts are you going to give everybody?  Let's really kick this promotion into high gear.  I'll tell you what I'll do.  I have aloe jelly, which is great for...  What is that?  You kind of cut some burn.  It's really good for anal irritation.  Sure.  Sure.  We're all about the asshole.  You're all about the vaginally.  It does very wonderful.  We all get it.  I'm going to bottle that for free.  That's good.  Well, hold on a minute.  That'll make a good pink stocking stuffer.  Absolutely.  You can pinch him over that one.  Wait.  Let me get this straight.  If we order now, you throw in the what? 
[03:58:00]  More stuff for your ass.  It's a terrific product.  You throw that in for free?  Absolutely.  I find that hard to believe.  You know, I'll tell you what.  I'll even knock off some money off the doggone thing on how much money I can knock off.  What, are you giving the stuff away for free?  How are you going to live, Doc?  The doggone thing.  Will you shut the fuck up?  You knock some money off how much, Doc?  Let's talk dollars and cents.  Six dollars off the doggone price.  How's that?  Six dollars off.  Six dollars.  And how much in the total?  This stuff is cheap.  It's not even a dollar a day. 
[03:58:30]  How are you going to make it?  You're giving it away.  Let me tell you something.  Wow.  I live for food, and it's my highlight of my life.  Sure is.  But I love when people are healthy.  That's my point.  The guy, he gives.  He gives.  Of himself.  Doc, does your wife have breast implants?  My wife does not have breast implants, but she's a double D.  Nice.  Doody, doody.  I go to your school, Doc.  That's what I graduate with.  No, if she's taking a lot of healthy shits, has that taken away from her double Ds? 
[03:59:00]  No, you know, I'll tell you what.  The nice part about it, she's got...  Makes them bigger.  If he makes a connection with big, hot breasts and shit, I'm going to shit myself.  She's got the kind of legs you guys would like.  Feet on one and ass on the other.  Those are the kind of legs I like.  Well, tied and broken is actually a little better if you want to ask me, Doc.  Doc, she can't run that way, can she?  Doc, are you a fan of the ass sex?  You know, I've had a little anal inaction before.  It's a little interesting, kind of a crappy deal. 
[03:59:30]  Hold on, Doc.  Let's, Doc, let's rewind and back that one up.  I felt you had a gem and you fumbled.  I'm going to back it up again.  Okay, fine.  No pun intended.  There's no beating you, Doc.  Wanting to, but...  Mike from Boston is...  Mike from Boston is asking,  is the doctor trying to suggest we raise a generation of super shits?  You know, yeah.  We need it.  Really?  That's right.  You know, these five-footers should be an everyday...  Every number 80.  ...that's the way you can, you know, break the record.  Yeah.  I'm dying to find out the first time you guys see a five-foot elimination on your picture. 
[04:00:00]  What the hell are you going to do?  Oh, Doc, I should videotape it then.  So just videotape so you're there for the experience.  You know what?  Clean out your pipes, et cetera.  We're just...  You're just not going to ever see that because...  I want to shit me a Christmas wreath.  Just make a big circle, throw some fucking needles on it from the tree.  Hang it on the door.  What the hell is it?  What do you want a Christmas wreath?  Get the whole damn Christmas tree coming out.  Oh, boy.  Why settle for the wreath when you can get the whole tree?  A whole Christmas tree made of shit.  That's right.  Just like your house. 
[04:00:30]  That's right.  Or maybe you shit on the roof eight times, you call it reindeer.  Right, Doc?  I don't know how it's a shit though.  Do you want to collect shit figurines?  That's right.  Yeah.  You live in a log cabin, Doc?  Give me those rips, sir.  You live in a log cabin, get it?  I kid because I love...  That bloody shit could be Rudolph.  Yeah.  That's right.  That's right.  The red-nosed shit.  That's right.  Rudolph with your prostate cancer or whatever kind would cause a red thing.  I don't know.  You're calling cancer?  And here's a hemorrhoid for you.  Ah. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah, look at him.  He's all stuck in the holiday spirit.  All right, Doc.  We got our runs.  I'm so sorry, guys.  Is this guy really a doctor, though?  Are you a doctor?  No.  Are you a medical doctor?  Or is it just your name?  He's a fake doctor.  I think he went to a convention down in Florida.  This is what he does now.  I paid my $2 and it was life.  Oh, is that true?  No.  You're not an MD, right?  You're not an MD of any kind.  I'm not an MD.  I have my naturopathic degree.  I've got 27 years now of talking poop.  Atta boy.  I know shit, trust me. 
[04:01:30]  You sound like you do.  You sure do.  He knows everything about it.  Sure do.  Yeah.  I will kick the living shit out of you, my father used to say.  I think he was not accurate.  After this today, I don't think his facts were accurate.  No, not a lot today.  As much as the doc.  Hey, on New Year's Day, do you hang your ass off the roof and shit right at midnight when  the shit hits your lawn?  It's New Year.  I pitch a big loaf every New Year's.  Dog shit sniffer from what side.  All right, Doc.  There's no reason to take it, Dave.  What are we, in the gutter?  Trying to have some fun and you're right down in the gutter again. 
[04:02:00]  I'm so sorry.  Dog shit sniffer from what side.  Nice Yule log.  Yeah, come on, Doc.  Let's keep it friendly.  Hey, Doc, are you the boar of the party or what?  Let's be honest here.  Let me tell you something.  Everybody, it's so amazing to me that no one wants to talk about shit, right?  But please, why would they?  But all of a sudden, you mentioned that you had this Alloese program and they all come  up to you and probably go, hey, can I talk about my life?  Oh, shit.  All in private, right?  And they go, hey, suck your dick. 
[04:02:30]  Something like that.  I know the feeling.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, did you ever mistakenly call a plunger a ladle?  Of course you have.  So, Doc, you opened up, you closed the great shit divide in this country.  If people just, they're hiding it like they don't want to talk about death and shit.  Is this Mike?  Is this who this is, Mike?  Yeah, good call.  Mike DiStefano.  You got a whole new show going on now, don't you?  Well, no, I like it a lot.  I like it because my next thing was shooting hookers with a crossbow, which I do on the 
[04:03:00]  weekends.  But you just.  I remember this guy, Dr. Dude, he goes, man, you got a shitload of jokes.  A shitload, yeah.  Doc, do you suggest we start like some kind of shit program where we collect all this shit  and then we can maybe, I don't know, make our own island somewhere.  Shit island.  That's right.  I'm not saying you have a shitty program, are you?  Because I don't think it is.  No, no.  Hey, easy there, Doc, with a shitty program, huh?  Come on, come on.  You guys are the best.  Of course we are.  Doc, you're the best.  We're pretenders.  Nothing to talk about at all.  There's no intent.  No one holds a candle to you.  We certainly don't.  Well, we have to have to adopt the bathroom.  Light a match, huh? 
[04:03:30]  I understand.  Light a match, that's right.  Oh.  This is crazy.  Listen, I hate to do this.  It's 11.15.  I got to go.  Yeah.  We got to go, Doc.  Dr. Dude, we could spend all day with you.  And believe me, it wouldn't be one shitty moment during the whole interview.  What are you doing?  I'm just having fun with the Doc.  We're ribbing you, Doc.  You know how it is.  We can't have any Jim Norton.  Mike, blow it out your ass, Doc.  Don't associate us with shit, please.  Yeah, come on. 
[04:04:00]  Hey, Doc, all kidding aside, continued success.  Of course.  Thank you.  Very kindly.  Hey, to you and yours, a happy and safe holiday season.  Right.  Thank you very much.  To you and yours.  Christian, Jew, we don't care.  That's right.  To you and yours, Doc.  You know, shit, we all shit the same, right?  Muslim, Christian, Jew.  Well, we're going to make them all shit the same as soon as they take the aloe cleanse.  That's right.  That's what the world needs.  Same colored logs.  Enough about the aloe cleanse.  Or is it aloe?  Whatever it is.  Aloe.  Aloe.  Yeah. 
[04:04:30]  Sorry.  All right.  Hey, Doc, take it easy, but take it.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it, guys.  Thank you.  Godspeed.  All right.  Up the ass.  Be good to you.  Nice.  All right.  Godspeed.  I love them.  God, Jimmy, you're fucking nuts.  I just love watching this shit.  Oh, my God.  Come on, Doc.  Give me some more information.  There's a plunger as a ladle.  Sure you do.  This show would never have made it without Norton.  Oh, my God. 
[04:05:00]  Jimmy's the best.  It's fucking...  When it comes to shit doctor interviews.  No, I'm the king.  Do you see how excited he got?  As soon as the guy was on the phone, he got up on his knee up on here.  Come on, Doc.  Come on, Doc.  Come on.  Shoot me some information.  Slow down, Doc.  Hey, what are you doing, Doc?  I'm a regular Joe.  I'm a regular Joe here.  Dr. Doody, you didn't hang up.  He's listening.  Hey, Dr. Doody.  Dr. Doody.  One more plug.  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  All right.  There he goes.  All right.  A lot of the day is brought to you by BodogFantasy.net.

Hold on, Doc.  Let me paint the picture.  We got a nice log.  There's a black tip, which never indicates cancer, and there's some red stuff, which,  I don't know, looks like a 10-pound duty fell out of a 1-pound asshole.  Am I right or wrong, Doc? 
[04:06:00]  What the hell is this?  Mike DiStefano.  Caroline's New Year's Eve.  Great appearance.  Yep.  I had fun.  Yeah, thanks, man.  It was great.  You were really good, man.  Thank you, buddy.  And we'll see you at Caroline's New Year's Eve with Jim Florentine.  The great Jim Florentine.  BodogFantasy.net, another runner-up line of the day.  And the legendary story of me and my brother actually hiking out at night.  It was really scary and really stupid.  You should take the donkeys down like the Brady Bunch did.  Nah. 
[04:06:30]  And then watch Mr. Brady do some work on one of the donkeys.  Nothing about my dead wife.  Well, it might not be the line of the day.  It ain't over yet.  You never know.  You got another runner-up line of the day.  Oh, boy.  We joke about therapy a lot on the show lately, but this, in a way, is therapy that you're  able to turn on a mic and just rant and rave, you know?  Yeah, not...  No, it's not going to work.  Oh, yeah.  No.  Jimmy, I don't even know what he's talking about, but I know he's manipulating right now. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah.  See, you got a little runner-up there.  Got a little bit of action.  No, the dead wife thing just creeped us all out.  Yeah, right.  A little too much for us.  Sorry.  We don't like to be in touch with our real emotions.  Oh.  Do you have a death song?  A what?  A death song.  Like a death song.  What does that mean?  A song that makes you cry because it reminds you of someone that's dead.  Ugh.  No.  Not a one.  The do-run-run-run for me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't go chasing waterfalls in that one. 
[04:07:30]  That's the one?  No.  I don't...  I don't reminisce, man.  Wang Chung.  Yes.  Well, we played one yesterday.  We'll play one today.  I got nothing.  Anyone have a death song they want to play today?  It's morbid.  No.  I started yesterday.  We should continue that?  I have to think, but I don't have one.  You really don't?  No, I don't think so.  Wang Chung?  That's a little sad, but if you want to put everybody...  Oh, wait.  White Lines?  That song White Lines?  It sounds crazy.  Is he a drug addict?  No, no.  We ran a guy over. 
[04:08:00]  We were robbing a drug dealer.  We hit him with the car.  And that song was on.  I don't know if he died.  He didn't die.  I'm pretty sure he was flopping around in the rear view.  Dude, are they looking for you?  How many years ago was that?  15 years ago.  It was by the Bronx Zoo.  It was all icy out, but we stole cocaine, but it wasn't cocaine.  It was fucking angel dust.  No, it was angel dust.  Oh, boy.  That's the shit that makes you jump off roofs.  Dude, I smoked one hit of it my whole life, and I attacked these kids with rocks. 
[04:08:30]  Listen, I thought...  Turned into a caveman?  It was in a yard filled with rocks.  You ever see, instead of grass, it's all rocks?  And I'm hitting the kids with rocks, because to me, they were marshmallows.  I was thinking they were marshmallows, and I'm hitting them, and they're bleeding and shit.  It was bad, so I never did it again.  Yeah.  Why would you even think they were marshmallows?  Because the dust makes...  The angel dust is nuts.  I was picking the rocks up like they...  And flip, you know, like, oh, they're marshmallows, and I'm hitting them... 
[04:09:00]  Why were you throwing marshmallows at them, then?  Why not eat them?  Because it was fun.  Oh.  And they're bleeding.  Ow!  Yeah, exactly.  You're like, come on, what are you doing?  What's the matter?  They're marshmallows, you little fucking homo.  I'm not saying...  And you ran over a drug dealer.  Well, with the cards.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  It happens.  We were taken off, and he was in front, and we hit him, and he was flopping.  But I don't think he died, and I'm pretty sure he didn't die.  How would you know?  I hope not. 
[04:09:30]  Well, I didn't go back to check, you know?  If someone's flopping around in a rearview mirror that you're driving the car of, you  kind of just keep going.  Why?  Because I didn't want to check on him.  You didn't want to have any problems?  I was younger and on drugs, and I didn't have as much compassion as I do now.  All right.  I'll go check now and see if he's there.  Here's your line of the day.  Thank you, boy.  Fantasy.net.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[04:10:00]  Line of the day.  God, you sound like E-Rock.  Trying to get some cinnamon down and stuff.  You should come in, and we do the cinnamon thing with you.  Yeah.  With one granule.  It's pure.  I don't think that was the line of the day.  It was a good line, though.  It was very clever.  He got a big laugh, and it referred to something we did on the show. 
[04:10:30]  It was perfect, Jimmy.  It may be tied into the sound effect.  All right.  We're done with it.  All right.  Look.  And also, Jimmy got away with one there.  Let's just let it be.  Can I plug real quick?  No.  No, but it wasn't for me.  Oh.  It's for the people of Cleveland.  I'll be seeing you when I come.  Ain't about me.  In February.  And a bunch of my shit's on myspace.com.  Eight city tours started.  That's sweet.  On sale.  Albany.  Minnesota. 
[04:11:00]  Just a whole bunch of places.  Denver.  Why are you going to snowy places?  I just want to do some gigs, man.  I want to go out there and do some gigs.  Yeah, but why not go south where it's nice, warm, comfortable?  I don't know.  Talk to fucking Pete.  I don't know why.  Denver in the winter?  Minnesota?  You put out in the winter?  Minnesota.  Holy shit.  Well, I'm a dumb cunt.  God bless you.  All right.  There's something I want to say, but I've forgotten that.  You love me and you're fucking very close.  No.  Why not?  Express some love for me.  It's not that bad.  No.  Where were you when I was dragging my Christmas tree yesterday?  Probably upstairs in my room. 
[04:11:30]  Yeah.  Watching me out your window laughing, right?  No.  I know how you are.  Absolutely not.  You spy on me, don't you?  No.  Yeah, you do.  I know you do.  Kenny does.  And he covered it by himself.  Did he say that?  No.  He would.  Couldn't wait.  Fucking Kenny.  Fucking Kenny.  All right.  There was something.  That's why I'm stalling.  It was something, but now I don't remember.  But Stan was out for a second.  What happened?  I thought you were out for a second.  No.  No?  No.  All right. 
[04:12:00]  I'm ready.  I'll just sleep on the drive home.  Yeah.  See you all tomorrow.  Autopilot.  Okay.  This is how we end today.  Yeah.  Mike, you end the show today.  We'll be back.  We have a problem with ending radio show.  We used to be like, cha-cha-cha, see you tomorrow, but now we just kind of sit here  and it just dies a slow death.  So you end the show.  Thanks for listening to Opie and Anthony today. 
[04:12:30]  And, you know, stay tuned for more stuff.  We're going to have reruns of the show.  Pay attention, fucking jackass.  You're stalking us.  You know a lot about this radio show.  No, I don't.  Yeah, you don't.  I want to do my own radio show about drug addicts.  I have all guests in that are on drugs.  Did we do that one?  Did we do that one?  What, that theme?  Yeah.  Well, Voss did a...  Yeah, Voss did something.  Yeah, Voss.  But it also turned into, how do I get into comedy?  And the only reason I'm asking that is because then now you got to spin it a little bit to 
[04:13:00]  make it your own.  It's called Rehab Radio.  I'm the host.  I'll have been criminals and guys with stories ten times worse than mine.  What?  It'll be funny.  All right, we'll take it over.  Leave your resume.  All right.  I don't have a resume.  I curse at people.  I was a drug counselor.  I was a drug addict.  And then I was 12 before that.  That's my resume.  All right.  There it is.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  This will not be over quickly. 
[04:13:30]  You will not enjoy this.  Well, that was fun. </pre>
