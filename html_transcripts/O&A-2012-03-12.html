<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a detailed account of the hosts' experience at a Bruce Springsteen concert at the Apollo Theater, attended by Jim Norton and Sam Roberts (with limited participation).  They recounted numerous celebrity encounters, including successfully obtaining photos with Tom Hanks, Michael Douglas, Michael J. Fox, and Elvis Costello.  Norton shared humorous anecdotes about the challenges of appearing cool while interacting with celebrities.  The discussion included descriptions of the after-party, the soul food served, and the difficulty accessing the VIP area. Norton and Anthony contrasted their approaches to conflict, reflecting on past experiences.  The segment concluded with speculation about how their behavior would have differed in the age of social media, particularly during Norton's heavy drinking years.

The show then extensively explored the hypothetical consequences of their past behavior if social media had been prevalent during their younger, heavy-drinking days.  This involved imagining various scenarios with offensive tweets, threats to politicians, and public displays of drunken behavior, all punctuated by vulgar language and crude humor.

Amy Schumer then called in, recounting a humorous anecdote about stealing a motorized wheelchair from a Las Vegas casino and using it to terrorize people.  She discussed her experiences on a cruise, her casual use of Plan B, and her views on attention-seeking behavior among attractive women on Twitter.  The conversation with Amy included graphic descriptions of bodily functions and crude humor.  A short, humorous pre-recorded interview with Max Weinberg (drummer for Conan O'Brien and Bruce Springsteen) about his preference between Google and Bing was also included.

The broadcast continued with a discussion about the fallout from Rush Limbaugh's controversial comments and the broader themes of outrage culture and cancel culture.  The hosts discussed perceived hypocrisy in targeting certain figures for offensive language while others escaped similar scrutiny, citing examples like Bill Maher and Kirk Cameron.  They criticized the media's selective outrage and the impact of advertisers pulling sponsorships from controversial shows. The conversation then shifted to a humorous anecdote about a faulty air conditioner causing papers to fly around the studio.  This segued into a critique of poorly executed commercials featuring actors attempting to portray comedians.

Carly, a 21-year-old aspiring stand-up comedian and a friend of one of the hosts, was brought into the studio. She performed a short stand-up set about dating, relationships, and her dislike for coffee.  The hosts provided feedback, discussing her anxieties, including her fear of subway crime, and touching on various aspects of her dating life and sexual preferences.

The show then delved into a discussion about sexting experiences, fueled by anxieties about accidentally revealing embarrassing photos.  This evolved into raunchy anecdotes and vulgar jokes about sex, relationships, and dating mishaps.  Specific details of a disastrous sexting exchange were recounted, along with other bad sexting, dating, and relationship experiences shared by the hosts and Carly, using highly explicit language.

Will Ferrell joined the studio. The conversation initially touched upon Colin Firth's (or a similar individual's) nonsensical Twitter activity and Louis C.K.'s drunken tweets about Sarah Palin.  The discussion then shifted to Ferrell's career, including his experiences with *Saturday Night Live*, critical reviews, and the challenges of filming *Casa de Mi Padre* in Spanish.  He mentioned his large antique gun collection.  The conversation returned to sexting, with explicit descriptions and jokes, before transitioning to the hosts' stand-up performances and celebrity encounters.  The Bruce Springsteen concert was revisited, focusing on Anthony's drunken behavior and Roland's (a staff member) experiences.  The show concluded with further banter, sexual innuendo, crude humor, and discussions about the Springsteen concert and future show plans.

A final segment featured a recap of the Bruce Springsteen concert attended by the hosts and Troy.  They recounted seeing celebrities and Troy described his pre-concert barbecue and frantic behavior.  A comparison of Springsteen's performance to a Paul McCartney show followed.  Jim Norton then shared anecdotes of his past drunken antics, including calling the FBI and the Klan as a teenager, his attempts to mimic Black vernacular, and his mother's subtle racism.  Carly, a friend of Troyâ€™s, joined the show, performing a short stand-up set.  The hosts questioned the nature of her relationship with Troy, leading to a discussion about how they met on Instagram and playful debate about whether Troy was a "creep."  The show ended with banter and goodbyes.

Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard.  You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened  show in the history of radio show in the history of radio show in the history of radio, but I'm  still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the O.P. and Anthony radio show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, O.P. and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Monday, ma.  Good morning.  He doesn't say that to me.  He just says, good morning. 
[00:04:30]  That's it, huh?  I don't know if he likes me.  Before I even step out of the elevator, I'm hearing, good morning.  Good morning.  Monday, ma.  Monday, ma.  Come on in.  Welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  Yeah.  Well, how is everybody?  Good, I hope.  That's just talking to the listeners out there.  Not yet addressing anybody here in studio.  It's kind of just an out there question.  Yeah, it's kind of like, hi, everyone.  It's a rhetorical question based on the fact that I can't hear you back. 
[00:05:00]  So, and I personally really don't care.  How you all are out there.  You don't care how you're doing?  No.  But I just got to ask anyway.  What?  Come on.  Yeah.  How are you?  I don't know.  Send your letters.  It's amazing when you say, how are you?  And someone answers and you're like, oh, shut up.  Yeah, shut up.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Yeah, how are you doing?  Good, good, good.  Yourself?  Oh, fair to middling.  Fair to middling?  What does that even mean? 
[00:05:30]  How are you doing?  Ah, do...  Why did I ask?  Oh, yeah.  You know.  Well, I'd let you know.  I complain, but who'd listen?  I say that a lot.  Do you?  Everybody laughs.  Everyone laughs.  Ah, yes.  Well, I hope he's on vacation.  So it's Anthony and Jim Norton holding the old ship down.  Oh, God.  Sinking it, actually.  Sinking the old ship. 
[00:06:00]  Hitting the old iceberg.  Wait, do we have a name for our show or no?  Did we have a Jim Anthony name?  Somebody named it.  It was awful and it was perfect.  Alka-Aids.  That's a good one.  Wait, wait.  I don't think anyone came up with a good name for the two of us.  Hmm.  Yeah.  That's all right.  I'd probably incorporate Sam Roberts in there somehow to make it work.  Oh.  That'd be terrible.  Yeah.  Sam is here.  Don't feel any obligation.  I won't. 
[00:06:30]  Believe me, I won't.  Boy, what a weekend, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  We had our Friday Bruce Springsteen show at the Palo Theater.  Live at the Palo.  That was very cool.  I had to go by myself.  I know.  I was shocked.  I went by myself and I was outside and I'm like talking to, I think, Liam.  Some bitches.  Yo, bitches.  Some, like, Annabelle and Liam, I think, who are both bookers here. 
[00:07:00]  And I'm like, I don't know what to do with this extra ticket.  Like, I don't want to waste a ticket to Springsteen.  Yeah.  And there was a woman there who was like, I'll take it.  And they're like, oh, she works for Sirius.  She couldn't.  They just didn't have enough tickets.  But they said she's really nice.  So I just gave it to this woman who was there.  I didn't even try to sleep with her.  I'm really dumb.  Yeah, really.  You could have probably parlayed that.  I should have.  Yeah.  But then how would you?  How would you?  Like, what would I say?  Like, you're going to jerk me off in the seat next to me. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Now she's obligated to do something.  I could never bring that to the management.  But, Scott, look, she said she would jerk me off and I got her in and she didn't.  And then I got nothing.  I would never win that argument.  No.  Probably not.  It was, I'll tell you, I'm not a Springsteen fan.  I think I've let people know that over the years.  Never saw Bruce live and seen him Friday.  I'm still not a fan.  Like, I'm not going to go out there and start buying up his albums. 
[00:08:00]  But I do have a newfound respect for the guy.  He puts on a really good show.  His fans love him.  And he sounds and looks great on stage.  He was awesome.  Yeah.  It was a great show.  I would buy that new record.  I didn't know a lot of the songs on it, but it didn't matter.  Yeah, yeah.  He's so good on stage.  I get why people like him a lot.  Yeah, you could tell.  You could tell why he has that fanatical Roland-type fan base. 
[00:08:30]  Roland was great, wasn't he?  Yeah.  He is such a fan boy.  Roland was in the third row.  Yeah.  They took care of him.  The company took great care of him.  They put him in the third row.  Yeah, they shit on us, but they took care of him.  Roland had better seats than Tom Hanks.  Yeah.  Yeah, he did.  He had better seats than Michael J. Fox.  Yep.  Scarlett Johansson.  There was a lot of celebrities there.  Michael Douglas.  Michael Douglas.  Roland.  Ben Stiller. 
[00:09:00]  Roland had better seats than any of them.  Than anybody.  He was right there.  They took good care of him.  His Instagram, he put some pictures up, and he's right there on the stage.  So, yeah, Roland had amazing seats.  How did he get those after the whole thing with him even getting tickets was, well, I don't think I'm going to be getting tickets.  I don't know.  And then they give him the best tickets they have.  They took good care of him.  Yeah.  And it was great to watch during the show because Springsteen comes out into the audience.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:09:30]  That was so cool.  He came out, he would go like four or five rows deep.  Yeah, yeah.  And then walk in through the seats and just stop in the middle of the venue and just fucking sing.  Yeah.  It was awesome.  I wonder how often he really does that, though, if it's not a celebrity-filled show at the Apollo.  Probably not as often.  He probably can't get away with that.  But, I mean, he went to the top balcony of the Apollo.  He came out from downstairs.  We could look up and see him.  Then he went above where we couldn't see him.  Yeah, up on the mezzanine, the balcony up there. 
[00:10:00]  And then, yeah, he was kind of climbing up and down ladders and jumping on the stage.  And the guy's, what, 62?  62.  That was fucking amazing.  He came out up to where we were.  I was sitting next to Ant and Melissa and the woman who, my de facto date.  Your ticket.  Who was very nice.  And Springsteen came right out to where we were.  And I didn't think I got the picture.  I just kind of ducked.  I was doing all the whole take-my-own-picture-with-the-camera fucking shots.  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  And I got a picture of me with Springsteen right behind me fucking jamming on the guitar.  He was, like, in the aisle at the Apollo.  It was great.  Yeah, I screwed up with one of those shots.  I had the camera set where it was taking a picture of me.  And Bruce was, like, right in front of me.  And I went to roll the video.  And I have video of me just kind of looking.  Oh, yeah.  I'm an idiot.  Were people bitching that there weren't a lot of Bruce fans there?  Is that what it was? 
[00:11:00]  It was, like, yeah.  I read on Twitter a lot of people were, like, how many actual Bruce fans got to go?  How many fans?  The place was rocking.  It was on fire, man.  And the celebrities that were there were fans.  Fucking, I know, because I got pictures of all of them.  Of course you did.  I annoyed everybody who came in the door.  That was great when I finally hook up with Jimmy at the seats.  And you started showing me who you have, who you got.  Look who I got. 
[00:11:30]  I was like, who did you get?  Wait, let me show you.  He can't just.  Jimmy can't just tell me.  He had to show me.  He has to unfurl.  And, yeah.  Are you still bumming about your Michael Douglas picture, though?  No.  I wasn't bumming even then about it.  And the Hanks one.  Because I had to hold the camera and point.  And I'm such a shrimp that when I took the Hanks picture and the Michael Douglas picture,  like, the very tops of their heads got cut off.  Yeah.  But it doesn't, people who looked at, nobody noticed, I noticed that.  It's like, everybody knows it's Tom Hanks and it's Michael Douglas.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, yeah.  It doesn't matter.  So, no, I'm not that bummed about it. 
[00:12:00]  Because, literally, I was talking to this guy who is this New York City cop who was just  kind of breaking everybody's balls when they walked in.  But he's like a big fucking burly cop.  He didn't give a fuck.  He wasn't in uniform, but he's like one of those guys.  Yeah.  Hey, you.  Hey, Detective Gadget.  You know, a guy with a suit.  Just like one of those dudes.  A ball buster.  The dude who you never want to want to be walking by him when you're with your chick  because he's like, hey, you should.  So, I was going to piss and he's taking a picture with some guy in a fucking, like an  overcoat. 
[00:12:30]  And I was just going to go around him and piss.  But I'm like, who is that?  Fuck it.  I'll ask the guy.  And it's Hanks.  Like, you turn around and it's Tom Hanks.  It was Tom Hanks.  Like, I literally almost just walked by and went to the bathroom and it was Tom Hanks.  So, I was happy.  If life was fair, I wouldn't have gotten him at all.  And then Michael Douglas walked in very quickly.  With Catherine Zetva-Jones.  Oh, was she with him?  I didn't even know that she was there.  Yes, yes, indeed.  I don't care about her.  She wasn't in Wall Street.  I didn't need her.  So, I got him.  And the only one that said no to me was Tom Coughlin, the Giants coach.  What the fuck?  But he wasn't a dick. 
[00:13:00]  He was a dick for saying no.  No, I was on the wrong side of him and his wife was with him and they were all chanting.  Like, they were all going.  And then if he stopped for me, he would have had to stop.  So, he's like, ah.  And he just kept walking.  But he wasn't being.  I can't say he was a dick.  Yeah.  I can't.  Nah, it was one of those things.  Yeah, I saw it when Tom Hanks was walking in.  It was Tom Hanks and his wife.  And then Colin Hanks was with him.  And they stopped.  Like, I guess the line wasn't really moving to go down the aisle.  And they stopped right by where we were. 
[00:13:30]  And I was like, hey, Colin.  How you doing?  He was like, and he went like, hey.  I go, yeah, you know, you were on the show trying to do like, trying to like.  Let Tom hear that you know him.  Yeah, exactly.  You know the game.  Explain to me.  Get the picture.  No matter who was with him, you would have said that.  Exactly.  But he was like, yeah.  He goes, oh, yeah.  But that was the day also Patrice was in.  And it kind of made, you know, the bummed out face and stuff.  Because he remembers, I guess, being on the show that day.  And I was just trying to parlay that into a picture with Hanks. 
[00:14:00]  Of course, you know.  So, yeah.  They all knew it.  And then Tom Hanks came by.  Of course they do.  They know the games.  And then, yeah, you were.  And then when we, at the after party, there was a VIP VIP room.  And that's where Bruce was.  And a lot of the celebrities that were hobnobbing.  All the celebrities.  We could not get in.  No, we were not in that section.  But I have, I think that was Springsteen's list.  Like, I have a fear that wasn't made up by Sirius. 
[00:14:30]  I think that was a list approved by Springsteen.  And there were, like, legit.  It was a small area.  And at first, it was, like, Bruce and a couple of people.  So, Anthony and his chick were sitting, like, in this kind of half-circle chair.  Yeah.  And then this half-circle chair behind him is fucking, uh, dissectioned off.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, we could have climbed over and got in.  That might have been trouble.  Yeah, of course.  And I was standing there with Roland.  And Bruce was talking to somebody.  So, I got Bruce's attention. 
[00:15:00]  And it was only, like, fucking four people back there.  Five people.  So, I'm pointing at Roland.  And I'm going, you got to take a picture with him.  And I didn't.  I was like, and Bruce was like, ah.  And he's like, I can't.  I'm here.  I'm like, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And I think he thought I wanted him to come out and hang out or something.  Bruce, come on, man.  I tried so hard to get Roland a picture.  I know.  It was, uh, it was impossible.  It was impossible.  Yeah.  But, I, by the, an hour after that, it was mobbed back there.  Like, it was all celebrities and Bruce's people. 
[00:15:30]  So, it was like, I kind of got why they didn't let anybody back.  Those areas always wind up getting packed out with a shitload of people.  It starts off, it was very sparse.  Just a few people.  You knew everybody.  You knew who everybody was.  And there's Roland right there.  We're looking at a live video of the event, I guess.  Where is that up?  I don't even know.  You don't even know?  Is it on, it's just on YouTube?  That's from up in the balcony?  You know what?  It's Sirius' own video.  Yeah, it's got to be because it's a multi-camera shoot that's going on here. 
[00:16:00]  You can see Roland.  You can see Roland is like right the fuck there.  Oh, by the way, we talked to Bruce's manager upstairs.  We said hello to him because Bruce knew who he was.  He's like a legend.  I mean, Roland knew who he was.  So, we were chatting with him, telling him how great the show was.  And he goes to Roland and goes, hey, yeah, you were having a good time.  You were in almost all the shots.  We filmed and we saw you the whole time.  Roland.  Yeah.  They were, it was fucking awesome.  Yeah, they were really, really good. 
[00:16:30]  That place fucking really rocked me.  He fucking, he was great.  I cannot say.  Oh, by the way, and in that back area, I think it was Clarence's son or nephew or something  who plays horns for him now.  Plays to have sex now, yeah.  Who was good.  Dude, he took 15 minutes to get in that VIP area.  I guess he wasn't on the list.  What?  It was hard for him to get in.  How the fuck was it hard for him to get in?  Dude, he was standing there the whole time.  He couldn't get in.  Roland and I would watch him, but this guy's not getting in.  He might have had a date with him.  Maybe he didn't have a plus one.  It took a while.  Oh, my God.  That's fucked up.  Yeah, that just shows you you're not getting even close to getting in. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  If he can't get in.  He's playing saxophone.  And I chatted with the guy who was Bruce's head of security who walked up to me.  And he goes, you remember me?  And I remembered him immediately.  He walked up to you and asked you to leave.  Sir, please go away.  But he was the guy who, when Bruce was in Minneapolis, and I fucking followed Bruce onto the elevator.  Oh, the elevator, right.  I talked to him first.  He goes, yeah, you and I were talking.  Then you followed Bruce onto the elevator, and I took the picture.  Wow.  It was just by default he was there.  But he was very nice. 
[00:17:30]  But he goes, yeah, it's crazy tonight.  So even he couldn't do it.  Yeah, yeah.  And so nobody was being a dick.  It was just one of those things where it was just a lot of people back there.  And Michael J. Fox.  Yes.  Now, the Michael J. Fox photo, you walked up to him and were like, hi.  No, he actually, we were standing there, and he walked up, like, that's Michael J. Fox.  And he looked at me, and I think his wife, Tracy, I think her name was, somebody was between us.  And he goes, hey.  He goes, hey, man.  He goes, how you doing?  He goes, you're hilarious. 
[00:18:00]  Fuck.  I was like, really?  Can you believe that?  Nobody heard it.  I was so bummed.  I was furious when I heard that.  I was furious.  I was like, oh, thanks, man.  And I took a picture.  I was like, can I get a shout out with you?  I think I lose status when I say that.  I just do.  Why?  Because you think that they think you're on par with them?  Because they don't live that light.  Like, well, Michael J. Fox does.  But Paul Rudd said hello.  He's like, oh, hello.  And then the minute I say, let's take a picture, they automatically knock me down to fan status. 
[00:18:30]  But I don't care because I thought.  Do you make sure to let him know how much you think Back to the Future is stupid?  No, I actually, dude, I panic in those moments so much, I forgot he was in it.  I would have complimented him on Doc Hollywood because I actually think it's an underrated movie.  And Family Ties is one of the best sitcoms ever.  Like, I love him.  He's phenomenal.  About 30 years.  It really is a great show.  So I fucking panic in those moments.  Yeah.  And I forget, like, but even, let's, I said to Ant, like, say I wouldn't have taken the picture.  Say I just would have said, hey, man, how great was Bruce? 
[00:19:00]  He would have been cool.  And then he still would have went into the VIP area.  Right.  And I still would have been out there.  And it's like he would have called me and said, hey, look, they're remaking fucking, whatever that city show was that he did.  Spin City.  It wouldn't have mattered.  It really does end up just that, you know, you take a picture with him or don't take a picture and he's still just going to leave.  It means nothing to my relationship.  And having that memory of him being like, for a minute you were peers doesn't mean anything to you if you don't have a photo of it.  No, it was very nice for him to say that. 
[00:19:30]  Like, I was really psyched that a couple people said hello and like, you know, of course you feel good about that.  But it does it when you don't take it or something.  It's not going to change that.  Not that I need it, but I would have got it.  I'm not going to say Fox.  But it's not like if I don't do it, they're going, it's going to mean like, hey, this.  It's not like when I saw De Niro at the cellar that time and I didn't ask him because he was with somebody who was a comedian I know who was working on a project with him.  Oh, look at, yeah.  I didn't ask De Niro.  Right.  Because he saw my set and he absolutely would have done it. 
[00:20:00]  But I didn't want to jeopardize him coming back.  Right.  To fuck with the guy I know who's doing a project.  I want him to think about things like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like that to me, I didn't want to be a fucking cock blocker with something my friend was doing.  So I fucking passed on a De Niro picture.  This is long after I've been complaining about it.  Oh, my God.  That must have been so hard.  It's the hardest thing I've ever done.  It's the hardest.  Dude, that must have been so hard knowing you could have gotten it.  I would have because he would have felt bad saying no because he had just seen me perform. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  But I was like, the bigger picture is I'll see him again.  Oh, boy.  And if I don't get him, I don't get him.  I mean, he did watch me and whatever.  But, you know.  So, no, I don't feel.  Well.  There's a case of a guy.  He watched my set.  He laughed.  I heard him laugh.  Did he fucking now?  I didn't ask him for a picture.  What did it do?  Well, yeah.  What did it do?  See, you did exactly what you didn't do with Michael D. Fox.  You were on level with him.  He's seeing you.  Yeah.  He's laughing and you didn't get a picture with him.  And, you know, where's his phone number in your phone? 
[00:21:00]  It doesn't mean anything.  When you're hanging out together.  It means nothing.  But next time I see him now, I got something.  Yeah.  Like, I'll go, hey, you saw me at the cellar.  I'll go, hey, let's do it.  Then I'll just fucking fanboy it up.  Yeah.  Loved him good, fellas.  I got a picture of Michael J. Fox.  And he just doesn't look very happy.  I wonder if, you know what?  Could we talk?  And then he kind of backs up when he talks to you.  Like, I noticed that in the room, too.  I just saw him talking to somebody.  He was kind of standing back.  And he looks.  I wonder if he takes Parkinson's medication. 
[00:21:30]  I literally just want it that makes him tired.  Because, or whatever it is, it's fucking.  It's probably heavy meds.  Yeah.  Because people in the picture are going, oh, he looks like a dyke.  Like, I was getting Twitters.  Jesus.  But I thought he looked great in person.  Considering the fact that he's fucking in his 50s now.  Yeah, he is.  And he has Parkinson's.  I was like, he looked way fucking better than I would have thought.  He's in his fucking 50s.  He's not a 30-year-old guy.  Parkinson's.  And he, yeah.  And he actually does look good.  For how short he is and the way he was moving, I thought it was bent. 
[00:22:00]  He's like, his arms are going.  He's fucking two feet tall.  But he was in better, like, he was, like, if you didn't know he had Parkinson's, there  was nothing he was doing that would have indicated for me that he had it.  No, not at all.  So I wonder if some of that is like a little bit of the medication, just kind of making  things manageable.  Might be.  See, your picture's nice.  He looks happy.  I think he looks great there.  You know what?  I've noticed in your pictures, though, Jim.  You get your head uncomfortably close to every single celebrity that you take a picture 
[00:22:30]  with.  On some of them I do when I'm holding the camera.  Yeah.  But a lot of times it's the force.  It's depth perception.  Is it?  Yes.  Like, look at the...  You're leaning your head on his head like, hi, sweetie.  And I'm actually a little bit ahead of him.  I'm just kind of in like that.  Okay.  All right.  But, like, look at the Tom Hanks one is in there.  And I felt like, fuck, man, the head got chopped a little.  Yeah.  But that one I have to look at the other side, which is, if life was fair, I wouldn't have  gotten him.  Yeah.  And don't you feel like you're going to miss the shot? 
[00:23:00]  Like, you take it too quickly?  Like, you don't want him to have to stand there too long?  Yeah.  There's the Tom Hanks with the top of his head cut off.  Yeah.  Which I'm not...  Frank and Hanks.  I'm actually okay with that.  Yeah.  Because I remember walking...  I saw the back of his jacket and I was like, I just...  I couldn't believe I got the shot.  And that one looks like you're snuggling on his little fucking...  On his shoulder.  Can you tell it's him?  In his scarf.  Yeah, you can definitely tell it's him.  He looks a little horrified.  Of course he does. 
[00:23:30]  That's a good picture.  If you're giving away the ticket anyway, like, if you weren't bringing anybody when you  got there, why don't you just bring someone to take pictures for you?  Oh, fucking photographer.  Because I thought of that and I didn't think anybody wanted to go.  You know how...  You're not a fucking fan, Danny?  I would fan.  I mean, I do.  I know that.  I know...  There's no...  The only fan here...  Travis is not a fucking big Bruce fan.  None of you guys are fans.  Because all you'd need is a guy with a camera and then you could just walk past the celebrity.  There's nothing I would have loved more than to bring one of my fucking...  Nago would have gone.  No, he wouldn't have.  He had some family stuff.  He couldn't have.  Watch.  There's no one here that wanted to go. 
[00:24:00]  Because he loves being a part of those celebrity pictures.  Nobody here wanted to go.  Nobody.  I would have had to go outside the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Which, you know, wouldn't have been that bad.  Yeah, but I...  Just to get somebody competent.  I figured that people didn't want to go because they were afraid of us to ask them to take  celebrity photos.  And you would have.  Yeah, of course I would have.  But I figured nobody wanted to be burdened with that.  For the exchange of the ticket.  But they really don't even have to ask the celebrity.  It's like, okay, there he is.  I'm going to walk past him and look at the camera and you just snap the picture. 
[00:24:30]  Sometimes, dude, but let me tell you something.  Sometimes with a person going, okay.  Sometimes me holding the camera is faster.  And when I'm holding it up already...  Right.  They're just obligated to look at it like...  I never would have got Michael Douglas with somebody else because I was walking when  I took that.  Yeah.  I was walking.  And a lot of times you go, hey, can I...  They're like, no, no, no, I gotta...  But if you're just like...  When you're holding it out...  There's a fucking camera in your face.  When you're holding it out, you're like, hey, can I take a quick shot?  They're like, all right, it's right there.  And they know it's just faster to say yes.  Yep. 
[00:25:00]  So...  We were also talking about embarrassing moments that...  Like, to make an embarrassing moment.  Tom Hanks was rocking out to Bruce.  The guy was enjoying the shit out of it.  And I just get these...  I don't know why, but I kind of get these ideas in my head to embarrass myself.  Yes.  Yeah.  Isn't that...  Why do you do that?  To, like, walk right up, squeeze into his aisle in front of him, and just go, Tom, real  quick, I have this movie treatment.  And just pull out, like, a script and hand to him in the middle of it. 
[00:25:30]  How angry would he be?  And how embarrassing would it be?  Or if you walked in with a fucking...  Because he was sitting...  Because Mel was there with his wife.  Oh, Mel?  They were...  Oh, Mel, huh?  Whoever said you'll watch one.  They were a couple of...  They were probably...  I mean, they'd be six or five rows ahead of us.  Yeah.  And then to the right, kind of in that level, is Hank.  So Mel would have seen it.  Yes.  Oh, man.  Yeah, yeah.  But can you imagine if you walked in and annoyed the biggest celebrity in the room with, like,  a fucking pen and a couple of DVDs? 
[00:26:00]  Like, three...  Holy shit!  Like, three or four, like, while his hand...  Because he had...  You know...  You forget that these guys are fans.  Yeah, they're fans.  Two.  A fucking...  A full-size movie poster.  You're unrolling it, trying to get Mel to hold the other end so it doesn't furl up on you.  And they're just going, it's okay, I work for this guy.  Ah, ha!  Ah, ha!  Hey, Mel, could you talk to him?  Mel!  Oh, oh, how embarrassing.  I'd just be giving you a look, like, here?  Yeah, what are you doing?  And just take some pictures. 
[00:26:30]  Look, look, take some pictures.  You know, we got...  Handmel the camera.  Just snap a few of me and talk to you all partying.  Yeah, all partying together.  Oh, man.  And they did the smartest thing.  In the seats, there was...  We were in row N, and...  Well, every row is...  It's the Apollo.  It was.  I understood.  All right, I know.  It was Strange Interloper, and then me, and then Ant and his girl, and directly across the aisle was Baba Booey, and I think his wife, and Fred Norris, and his wife. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  It was so funny that they calculated that so nobody could complain.  No one could say they got better seats than we did.  We were both in the exact same status position.  Right across the aisle.  Whoever has heard shit on the air...  I gotta say, people hate me, bitch, but there are times where it gets things done.  They wanted no part of anybody's complaining from either show.  They didn't want anyone saying they were one row ahead of us. 
[00:27:30]  Nobody got one up.  Or one row behind.  It was exactly the same.  And they were fucking great, man.  They were really cool, too.  I saw the stern Opie and Anthony family photo on Twitter.  Yeah, the family photo.  It was, uh...  Yeah, well, Howie wasn't there.  Um, but yeah, Gary and, uh, and Fred.  It was fun, man.  Gary, Fred, me, um, Anthony, of course, and that's chicks.  You chicks. 
[00:28:00]  Fucking photo.  I was like, oh my God.  Yeah, I know.  They all just kind of flopped together, and it looked like she posed for an hour and 20  minutes to take that.  Some people just know how to, like, make the right face and right...  I don't know how the fuck that works.  With me, it's, you know, if the lights are off, then I know how.  Don't you love, by the way, the, uh...  I love that Apollo background.  It's red.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a weird red wall in the back bar of the Apollo.  Of course, gaudy red wall. 
[00:28:30]  It's...  That's a fun shot, man.  Yeah, that is.  Gary does look like he's photobombing us.  I know.  He's, like, kind of peeking over the top of Jimmy's head.  I think the important thing to note, though, is that I look skinnier than you think I should  in a photo.  I think that's the point that we should all be making.  Since Dan has looked so skinny for a year now, it's about time I skinnied up.  Yeah.  Wow.  That does look, uh...  You look a little trim in that photo.  Thank you.  I was just forcing a compliment for myself.  No problem.  But I'll take the piggybacked one. 
[00:29:00]  But that was a fun night, man.  That was cool.  I like how people walk up to it, they talk to you, and then go, uh...  Hey, enjoy the show!  Like, it's their responsibility to even tell you that.  They don't know what else to say.  No, I guess not.  Ronnie B was very cool.  He was digging the shit out of the show.  Oh, is he a big Bruce fan?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, he fucking...  He loves that music.  Did he go asking celebrities for pictures?  Uh, no.  No.  Ron Bennington, uh, nah.  And there's a guy who is just on par with everybody, if not a little better than any of the celebrities. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Because he just, uh, he's like, ah, yeah, whatever.  His whole vibe is like the celebrities.  Who's that guy?  Yeah, yeah.  Is that, uh...  That's a cool guy.  Who's he?  Every time, um, Bruce went to play a song I didn't know,  I, uh, hit the bar.  So I was at the bar a lot.  Uh, yeah, there were maybe two, three songs I knew.  Ant was, Ant was making me...  Ant was being so loud at a couple of moments, like laughing, like laughing.  I think there was one part where they were playing the horns, and it's really quiet. 
[00:30:00]  Because it was like an ant's going, ba-da-da-da, what were you doing?  Ya-da-da-da, ya-da-da-da, ya-da-da-da, doing the Jimmy Horn thing.  And Jim just puts his head down and starts laughing.  I was fucking embarrassed, and I was laughing.  And there was one song that started off with a piano, and the fucking ant starts going,  Sing us a song on the piano, man.  Because it sounded just like it.  I know.  It was like, it's nine o'clock on a Saturday.  I yelled it, and somebody actually, two rows in front went, different guy. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, I was just being obnoxious.  Because the Springsteen fans are so hardcore.  Roland says that when he goes to Springsteen shows, and people are singing along with what  he's singing, he gets annoyed.  Oh, man, because he wants to hear Bruce.  You're two rows back at this life.  Singing Billy Joel.  Once-in-a-lifetime Apollo show going, ba-da-da-da-da.  Ya-da-da-da.  Yeah, like those big, you know, East Street horns.  I just couldn't stop thinking of the way Jimmy does horns.  Da-da-ya-da-da. 
[00:31:00]  Whomp-whomp-whomp-whomp.  I hit that, too.  Whomp-whomp-whomp-whomp.  Whomp-whomp-whomp-whomp.  I really...  Here's the East Street horns.  We got some exclusive audio.  Yeah.  Boy, they sound great.  Is this Born to Run?  All right, thank you.  I kept thinking I was hearing, like, Glory Days.  Every song.  Every song, Chip would turn to me and go, is this Glory Days? 
[00:31:30]  All pink Cadillacs.  Like, no, Chip.  No, it's not.  I do love just that thought of somebody passive-aggressively saying,  it's a different guy.  Oh, yeah, the guy was like, it's a different guy.  Oh, really?  I thought it was at a Billy Joel concert, you fucking asshole.  Of course not.  You ruined that moment for him.  Yeah, probably his song, too.  Oh, yeah.  I know this one.  He was probably, like, had his phone up to record the whole thing,  and now he's got me fucking singing Piano Man at the beginning of it,  ruining it for him. 
[00:32:00]  Fuck him.  I don't care.  You see what a fucking asshole Sam is?  Like, look at all the joy he got out of somebody's favorite Bruce song  getting ruined.  Getting destroyed.  You guys were already past it, but he still couldn't get past how great  that was, but it was ruined for him.  Ant is just unapologetically this obnoxious guy in this once-in-a-lifetime  concert that, for a Bruce fan, this is the lifetime moment,  and you're sitting there seeing Billy Joel's song.  Because it kind of sounded like it.  I'm sure it didn't. 
[00:32:30]  It was just the same instrument.  What was I going to do?  It was kind of similar.  There was a couple of moments where I was really embarrassed.  Yeah.  A couple.  It got quiet.  Like, you know, when he would do a quieter, he wasn't too preachy.  Like, I was expecting way more political stuff.  Not very little.  And a couple of the songs he sang were fucking, like, the ones I didn't recognize,  which I didn't recognize most of the tunes, and they were still great.  Yeah.  Did I recognize?  I don't recognize.  Because I don't know, like, Badlands he did.  I don't know Bruce's stuff.  I don't know if I recognized anything.  The most populous song he played that I knew was 10th Avenue Frieza. 
[00:33:00]  That's the only one.  I've never heard that.  That's it.  I don't think I knew one song.  Yeah.  I've heard, like, Badlands, when I heard the chorus, I was like, okay, it's Badlands.  East Street Shuffle, is it called?  I don't know.  I wish Roland was here.  We'll talk about it.  Yeah, I knew every song.  He was singing, dancing around.  Roland was fun.  I really wanted to get him that picture.  It just wasn't.  I know.  We might have made a connection for the next show.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's what you did. 
[00:33:30]  You laid the groundwork for the next one by talking to everybody involved.  But it's, because I know how much it means.  It means much more to him than it would, you know, to most people.  Yeah.  But Springsteen's a superstar, man.  You can't watch that show and not go.  And you forget, like, guys like Hankson, like, this fucking Michael Douglas.  These guys are just fanboys like we are when it comes to a guy like that.  They're just fans.  Yeah, they don't have to be there to be seen, you know?  They're not like, hey, I better go to this event and, you know, be seen and have pictures taken of me. 
[00:34:00]  That's Michael Douglas.  They don't want to.  He doesn't, yeah.  They just wanted to see Bruce.  They want to just run in and fucking.  And when you watch them, like, sing along, like, you catch these guys.  It is weird to see.  Isn't it?  It's so out of context.  It's so out of context to see them acting exactly like I'm acting or anybody else is acting.  Yeah, yeah.  Being a rock star must rule.  Yeah.  It's goto.  It's goto.  But you get why he's famous for that long.  Like, you get why his fans love him so much.  Like, I, watching that, I kept thinking, like, now I understand why they're fucking so hardcore, these people. 
[00:34:30]  And, yeah, the, um, how else was I going to say about Bruce, the, uh, no, there's something else I was hitting on that you were doing.  Oh, no, it was at the, uh, at the, yeah, the after party, uh, the bus ride when we got on the bus.  You go outside, they have a special wristband for us.  And, uh, there was buses outside to take us three blocks to the party.  Three blocks, because they don't want people walking through Harlem, I guess.  Yeah, of course not.  It was smart. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  And they, they had the nice big buses that took us.  It was only, like, ten people on our bus.  Ten people on a giant fucking, like, tour bus.  Uh, and then we got to the after party.  And, um, it was, it was like a, uh, a soul food layout.  Oh, was it?  I didn't see the food.  Oh, uh, the food was upstairs.  And then you had to go, like, downstairs carrying your plate and everything and find a table, which was, uh, almost impossible.  I went up sitting down and started eating, and I realized that was the reserve table for the E Street Band.  And so I had to get the fuck up and then found some other table. 
[00:35:30]  But, um, oh, man, they were laying out some fucking, uh, some soul food, yo.  And I was digging it.  It was good.  I've never eaten soul food.  Sylvia's in Harlem, I think, has.  Yeah.  I want to eat some good soul food, because it's like, you keep, that many people can't like it that much, and it's awful.  Yeah.  Like, I don't know, I don't know why I always think that it's not.  Like, sweet potato pie, I used to motherfuck sweet potato pie.  Fuck you.  It stinks. 
[00:36:00]  And, uh, I had some, and boy, does it rule.  Good stuff.  Fuck!  Yeah.  You're a Sylvia's.  I thought if they knew who I was, they were going to spit in my food, but, you know.  I did.  I was getting some big laughs on that bus, too.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Chip was everywhere, and he was doing the forearm push thing with the hand.  The fucking, he bombed so badly on that bus.  Yeah, it was the line.  It was, I don't know, it was one dart after another. 
[00:36:30]  It was a horror joke.  It was a horror joke.  It was a horror joke.  Whatever they were about the bus and being late for the show, and it was just, oof.  He was making jokes about the bus.  We're just saying, hey, you know, hey, what do we, what do we, uh, this bus is not too full or something, right?  Like, just nothing.  It wasn't even a joke.  No.  Yeah, there were a couple of young ladies that were on the bus also, and they didn't understand that Chip.  It got a zero.  Yeah.  Chip got a zero from it.  Chip was trying to win him over with his humor.  Yeah, just observation that got a zero.  Like, yeah, get these people.  We're going to be late or something.  Nothing.  Yeah, there's no joke there. 
[00:37:00]  It was horrible.  Yeah, Chip swung hard and missed terribly every time.  You've got to respect him for his swing.  Oh, just banal nonsense.  He does try very hard.  I got a picture with Cousin Brucie downstairs.  Oh, you saw Brucie?  Cousin Brucie was down there, and the washroom attendant at the Apollo, the worst washroom attendant ever.  Well, he just sits there like a fucking blues guitarist with his sunglasses on.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  He sat in the chair, and, like, you know, they make the effort.  They turn the fucking faucets on, make sure the water's the right temperature, and then as you're washing your hands,  they're getting the paper towels ready for you.  This guy sat there, did nothing.  And then when I went to grab for a paper towel, which is just in a stack right there, he literally took his pinky and pushed the stack of paper towels a quarter of an inch, like, toward me.  Like, yeah, I know where they are. 
[00:38:00]  He knows it's fucking white night.  Everybody's tipping.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, and I pulled a buck out and gave it to him.  Yeah, me too.  Fuck.  Yeah, that must be, like, banner night for them.  That's like fucking, that's like Black Friday.  That's their Super Bowl.  Which is ironic.  Oh, yeah, the shopping.  Yeah, yeah, it's white Friday.  Whenever they come in to work and they see the marquee and they're like, they're like, D.L. Hughley, oh, shit.  Ah, fuck.  But then they see fucking Springsteen.  Oh, yeah.  Here it is.  Tips for everyone. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, it was cool.  That bathroom is where Ant and I met the Stones last.  Met, uh.  Yeah.  Keith Richards and who was the other one?  Keith.  And, um.  Ron Wood.  Ron Wood.  Yeah.  No, uh, no big celebrities in the bathroom this, uh, this time around.  It was, uh, well, unless you consider Cousin Brucie a celebrity.  Because I did see him right there.  I think Springsteen knew him.  I bet you he did.  Probably did.  You can't not know Cousin Brucie.  But I don't think he's going to gap with him like he did, uh, Ed Burns, you know?  I don't know.  Maybe not because he didn't break him. 
[00:39:00]  Like, you know, because that was after Brucie's, but then he had early 70s.  Cousin Brucie's a legendary guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  How did you get the picture with, uh, Ed?  He walked in.  I just said, hey, man.  He was talking to somebody.  Took a couple pictures and I waited for him.  Ed, Ed was a really nice guy.  Yeah.  Um, and I just snapped it.  And me, and that big, that big cop was a, that big, he was like a big burly.  I can't say he was fat because he was like a pretty solid burly, like a barrel chested  dude.  But he was, uh, he was not, I wish my Hank's picture was like that.  He was actually, uh, he was very nice.  He said, hey, thanks guys. 
[00:39:30]  Like he was, he was a really, he was a nice guy.  He seems like a nice guy.  Nobody was a dick.  Again, Michael Douglas was on the, the only reason I even knew.  He was coming in is because the main doors were open and I saw him walking.  I'm like, that's fucking Michael Douglas, but he was moving and he was not stopping.  No one was asking him because no one was noticing him.  And as soon as he walked in, I was like, Hey Michael, can I get a boom quick one?  And then that was it.  He was, he was on the move.  And then someone's like, come on, we can't stop.  We can't stop.  Oh, you got a good one.  Yeah.  I like the different faces Norton makes in his photos. 
[00:40:00]  I was like, that smile is a satisfied smile.  Like, gotcha.  Like, yeah.  I'm going to get this one, but I gotcha.  That's, that's Jimmy taking a big hit off a crack pipe.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  It's a celebrity.  It's, it's happening.  The picture's being taken.  You know, you have it.  You're like, ah, I got it.  Elvis Costello was nice.  Elvis Costello.  Oh, I was so embarrassed at the after party because Elvis and I took a picture together  and I saw, I saw him.  We were standing there and he goes, what is this place? 
[00:40:30]  I'm like, I'm not too sure.  But I realized he was talking to the guy next to him.  Oh, not you.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jimmy, you did that.  Yes, I did.  That is embarrassing.  I did.  Well, it's, I don't know.  When did you realize in mid sentence?  When he just looked at the other guy who started answering him, I was like, ah.  And did you turn away like you were talking to someone else?  Duh.  How'd you deal with it?  I just did one of those.  Duh.  Duh. 
[00:41:00]  And I saw little Stevie there, but he, I don't know if he saw me or just avoided me.  Because he's, I saw him, he's very nice, but he probably just wanted nothing to do with me.  I guess, you, you did an interview with him, Mr. Roberts?  Yes, it wasn't live, but.  Oh, okay.  See, I thought it was live.  What's the matter?  They don't trust you with the live stuff down here?  I think he wasn't doing an interview.  He wasn't coming in here on a Sunday to do the stupid Sam Roberts show.  Oh, the stupid Sam Roberts show.  No.  He's a nice man.  Yeah, yeah.  Great.  Yeah.  And, uh, and he's like, you know, you forget, he's been with Bruce for, for quite a while, 
[00:41:30]  man.  Since the 70s.  Yeah.  And he's up there rocking, a little pudgier than he used to be.  But, uh, you know, you forget, like, I, when I see it, it's like, oh, it's fucking  Syl from Sopranos.  But, no, he's, uh, he's with the E Street Band.  And Max Weinberg's a good drummer.  I mean, the band sounded really good.  I didn't, the whole band we saw came to the after party.  I didn't, uh, Pat Riley was there, the old Knicks coach.  There was 17 fucking people on that stage.  It was mobbed.  17 fucking people.  I should have got pictures with the other people, but I already, I got. 
[00:42:00]  With who?  The whole band?  Yeah, like the piano player.  I guess so, right?  All the, all the fucking people that would, yeah, that's kind of like, what are you going  to do with that picture, though?  I just, who's the main guys?  It's Bruce.  Bruce.  And then Max Weinberg.  Yeah.  And Little Stevie.  Yeah, yeah.  And Clarence was one of them, but he's gone.  Well, he's not around anymore.  And then, uh, you know, Bruce's wife was up there, that redhead.  I didn't see her at the after party.  She might have been there.  Oh, yeah, I didn't see her either over there.  She's that redhead.  She was sexy, though, man. 
[00:42:30]  I, I, like, yeah, she looked good.  That's kind of suck, though, working with your fucking wife, though, every night.  If you're getting into an argument, or you have a problem, and you gotta, you gotta go  up to her and sing to her while you're fucking mouthing the word cunt.  Unless she's one of those women, though, like, who knows when to shut the fuck up, meaning,  like, you gotta show, all right, lay off, we'll finish this later or tomorrow.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, be professional.  Yeah, maybe she's one of those people who just knows when you're fighting. 
[00:43:00]  Some people don't fight like you and I fight, chick.  Like, like, you know what I mean?  Like, when I fight with a girl, it's like, I don't know how to stop.  And some people will go, like, all right, all right, shut up, forget it.  And then they're done.  Like, some people just know how to argue without getting crazy.  I, uh, I usually forfeit any victory for peace of mind.  You do?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm a forfeit the victory for just, uh, peace.  I'm peace, peace with dishonor.  That's me.  Peace with dishonor.  I wind up biting my tongue and, um, not, and just saying, okay, whatever, you know. 
[00:43:30]  Not even a whatever.  It's like a, yeah, okay, look, I'm sorry, whatever.  I wish I could do that.  That's such a smart thing to be.  I don't know why it's hard for me to do that because I look at it like it's a loss.  Like, it's so stupid.  It's such a dumb way to be.  And I catch myself like, why are you thinking that way?  I think the only person I wasn't like that with was the ex-wife because she was so cunty that I couldn't, I couldn't stop.  I would just be like, you know, I'd keep the argument going because she would anyway. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  At three in the morning, she decided that's a good time to argue.  She was one of those.  Yeah.  Where I'd be in bed just going, I gotta go to sleep.  Yeah, you gotta go to bed.  Well, I gotta fucking tell you.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  But, yeah, but for years I've been the, you know, the argument where if it gets, if it escalates to a certain point, then I know to just end it because it's not going to get any better.  And it's just going to make, for an uncomfortable atmosphere.  Yeah, I wish I could do that, man. 
[00:44:30]  I envy that quality.  Yeah.  It's not a pussy way to be.  Like, sometimes you're just like, I'm right, I'm right.  Like, why can't I do that?  It's, it's.  If something's important, I'll stand my ground.  No, no, no, but I mean bullshit arguments.  But 99% of the arguments you get in are bullshit arguments.  So why the fuck am I going to, you know, sacrifice that?  And then you realize if you do that, within 15 minutes, 20 minutes, it's like it never happened.  They'll start saying something to you, you know, maybe make a joke or something. 
[00:45:00]  And then you realize everything's cool and you're not fucking, you know, miserable with that fucking steamed head walking around your house.  Yeah, I, uh, it's a good quality, man.  Are you, are you the one that just keeps it like, you know, you can't let it go?  It builds up.  It's almost like an OCD.  Like, I have to say everything that I need to say.  It's, it's a stupid quality.  I know it's a dumb quality.  And I'm a, I'm one of those, uh, power driven argument people.  That's why a lot of times, there's times in life where I bite my tongue. 
[00:45:30]  Believe me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, because I know that if I open my mouth and it starts to come out, it's gonna be ugly.  And it's gonna keep coming out.  Yes, and other people probably think that it's like that they're on, that their people are scared to argue with them.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no.  No, dummy.  Believe me.  I know myself.  I, I don't trust myself.  Yeah, yeah.  So sometimes, you know, I learn to shut my mouth for that reason.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:46:00]  Or I don't try not to fire out fucking angry emails or text messages.  I mean, I send some angry ones to like my ex-girlfriend when we would fight.  But I'm careful with like, with like, uh, work stuff or professional relationships or clubs or, you gotta be fucking kidding.  Angry email, man, can really.  I am, I am second-guess my email guy all the fucking time, even when I'm completely justified and I, I write an email that's maybe a little, uh, a little terse. 
[00:46:30]  But, uh, and I'll word it.  I'll, I'll toil over how I word the thing so it doesn't, so they can't interpret it as anything but what it actually is.  But then right when I hit send, I start thinking like, oh, God, uh, why did I, yeah, maybe I could have did, but, you know, that's because I just, I really am not a, uh, a conflict guy.  I, um, I'm not, I'm not good with conflict.  I don't like the uncomfortable feeling of, of being in the room with somebody that you're having an issue with. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, it's, uh, it's smart to think before you send one of those off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And believe me, uh, well, I, you, you don't have to deal with this, but, boy, if you're drinking, sometimes, uh, you go like, oh, oh, boy.  You know, I.  Maybe I should have held that one back.  Um, yes, it's, uh.  Can you imagine, now, knowing the stories you told, Jimmy, of your, um, drinking days, uh, many, many years ago, uh, just the, the dumb stuff that you did that made you end up, 
[00:47:30]  uh, just, you stopped drinking.  Uh, what if there was Twitter, email, shit like that, that was instantaneous delivery of your thoughts?  When you started with this question, I just, inside, I started to die.  Like, oh.  Like, rock, yeah.  Fuck no, man.  Do you think, could you come up with any scenarios that you might have, things you might have done if there was Twitter and email and text? 
[00:48:00]  Oh, I would have just Twittered.  I'm crying right now.  Oh, I, I was, I was fucking, I was, uh, melodramatic teenage jizz bucket.  Would you constantly be, uh, uh, tweeting that you were, um, ready to kill yourself or you should have killed yourself?  Yeah, just a maudlin sap.  I really was awful.  That's all I would be doing. 
[00:48:30]  The pain.  Nobody understands the pain.  Oh, jeez, no.  Oh, I would have tweeted quotes that I thought made me sound good.  Like, like, like when I was in high school, again, I was a senior.  I put a John, I, I just saw Ann's lip go like, oh.  I know, like, oh, no.  But I tweet, I, I, I put a John Lennon quote in my yearbook.  I didn't even listen to John Lennon.  But if I, if I was being honest, I would have wrote, go fucking crazy, crazy train.  If I was.  But you were trying to be, uh, cool and fucking. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, and I wrote, silence sometimes says more than trying to say what's been said before.  Ew.  Oh.  Why would you even, yeah, that's not anything.  That's actually a great quote from a non-douche.  But from a douche, it sounds terrible.  From a douche, it stinks.  It's terrible.  And I didn't even know what it meant.  Because all I did was say what had been said before.  Yeah.  I never displayed silence.  Yeah, wait a minute.  I just drank and babbled. 
[00:49:30]  What if there was a, a, a girl you would have liked?  That would have been bad, too.  Oh, I would have put in her.  Yeah.  I would have been like, you know what, once everybody fucking sees my pain, she'll rescue me.  Oh.  It's terrible.  I love you.  I'm hurting.  Are you?  And, and, and, and imagine that, that you would be, you'd be tweeting that to, you'd  probably have 25 followers, maybe.  So all that pain to just people that you know that would be like, oh, Jimmy's off on it again. 
[00:50:00]  If I had been a comedian and a hundred thousand people.  Oh, and still drink.  Like even worse to my career.  Oh, man.  The damage I would do to celebrities.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You probably wouldn't have been good.  Oh, my God.  That would have been bad.  Oh, my God.  Threats to politicians.  Thinking I was being lawyerly.  Secret service would have been, uh. 
[00:50:30]  Like I would write to any, to any random politician.  I would write something like, you know, if I was of a different mindset, I'd shoot you.  And then think I was protecting myself by saying, if I was a different mindset.  Like I would have had my dumb things I thought a lawyer should say.  Well, he's, uh, no, he's not at the right mindset.  So I guess we shouldn't investigate this one.  Oh, all right.  Let him go.  He's clear.  I'm sober.  There's a, yeah.  Cause there's the two things.  There would be you back then at that age drinking like you were.  And then what you would tweet if that was around at the time. 
[00:51:00]  And then now how you would be.  You, I couldn't even imagine you getting as far as you've gotten based on your story.  No, no, no.  I would have killed myself.  But let's just say for the sake of argument that I had.  Yes.  Or say I quit drinking and started again.  Oh, man.  What a nightmare.  I'd say I was six months into my fucking relapse.  Oh, no.  I was already not coming into work on time.  I was coming in hungover and fucking still drunk and motherfucking everybody.  Hey, that's my gig.  No, but I, you at least, the only thing with you is occasionally you'll be tired, but you 
[00:51:30]  at least can function and you're still pleasant and you do, you know, you're still funny.  I was awful.  Yeah.  It would have been terrible.  Oh.  Fuck you.  It would have been four hours of that.  Of you just laying into people for no reason.  Are you sorry?  That would be great.  It would be okay.  And after years, you'd come out and say you were gay. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  Years, the first day in.  I fucking sucked into it.  There's nothing worse than adult crying.  You would cry?  Adult crying.  It really is bad.  If you were a drunk, you would come on the air and cry?  I was the worst.  I was the worst.  I was that guy.  I was the ruiner of fun at parties.  Ant's a fun guy.  Like I said, I tease Ant.  The only thing he'll do is occasionally be a horse's ass and fucking do like, you know, 
[00:52:30]  at a quiet moment in a fucking taped show.  Sing Billy Joel song.  Yeah, yeah.  But he's not obnoxious, awful guy.  Occasionally, like, you know, you'll be in his pool and he'll go, and fucking Daniel  Craig was here.  And he wasn't sure if you heard it the first 39 times.  So he'll repeat it at four in the morning.  I am drunk repeating guy.  Yes.  But it's funny.  It's harmless, and it's funny, and he's Anthony, and he's not being, he's not terrible at all. 
[00:53:00]  Honestly, I would tell you.  Always with a smile.  Yeah, you know, you're a very, you're a very palatable, fun guy to be around, even when  you're drinking.  You're that guy.  You're big.  You're, you know, whatever.  You're silly.  You would just be cursing out people at your party?  Fucking, I was Dwight Yoakam.  Oh, no.  I was fucking.  Oh, no.  I was the guy who would sit in the corner and just sulk and let people come over.  What's wrong?  Fucking nothing.  Get the fuck out.  Oh, man.  I was terrible. 
[00:53:30]  I cringe when I think of how I would have behaved.  Oh, God.  It's humiliating.  That's, uh.  I would have been all.  And, and was it that you.  That fucking, you guys, we'll see what you're doing.  I'm fucking a work here.  Oh, shit.  And nobody's threatening your job.  Oh, no.  But nobody would be like, fine, go.  You're annoying everyone.  Oh, wow.  Was it that you drank a lot or you couldn't hold what you drank?  You're two for two. 
[00:54:00]  I'm sorry.  Yes.  And yes.  Yes.  Oh, I was a fucking boob.  Wow.  Because that, yeah.  If you get somebody that can drink a lot, but then once they get drunk, they're obnoxious,  then occasionally they're just, you know, social drinking and they're not that bad.  But you were bad every time you drank?  Every time.  Did you ever have a social drink?  Like, oh, we're just going to the bar.  We'll just, we'll have a social drink. 
[00:54:30]  I never drank in a bar because when I was 18, I looked young.  Wow.  The only bar I ever bought alcohol was in New Brunswick.  They would give me, they would serve me occasionally.  Like, I'd walk into this, it was a black bar, so it was like the white guy walked in.  And I guess they just, I don't know why they served me.  Maybe they didn't give a fuck back then.  Or maybe it was just to get me out of there.  Or, you know, it was like, it was not a, I don't know if it was a bad bar.  I can't say it was.  It was just, it was the only white face in the place.  Yeah.  So I would go there to get, that was the only place that would serve me.  But my buddy Bill D'Angelo, who I talk about, by the time he was six, had a full beard. 
[00:55:00]  He was one of those guys who just looked 51 when he was 11.  So Bill would always get served.  Or, you know, other guys I knew would get served, but I couldn't, I never drank in a bar.  Man, wow, that's, hmm.  Well, thank God I wouldn't have teeth if I did.  Yeah.  Oh, imagine you all drunk, maybe looking at a girl and being like, ah, what are you doing with this guy?  What the fuck do you see in here?  Ah, he doesn't understand.  I'll show you what a real relationship is. 
[00:55:30]  You can be trying to be sensitive and looking for girlfriends.  Oh, man.  Not hookups, girlfriends.  I'll show you what, I have so much potential for love.  Oh, were you horrid?  Oh, fucking yuck.  Me, me, me.  Dude, I was, that's, I was that guy.  Yeah?  Yeah, I was a twat.  That's sad.  I was a, I was a twat boy.  You, you, you did have the, um, you did have the, the, the foresight, though, to know, uh, you should not drink. 
[00:56:00]  That's what keeps me away is knowing there is a Twitter and a Facebook and email.  And, oh, boy.  You could destroy your life and career.  One drink.  And, and, and, yeah, one drink.  One fucking drunk.  One night of not remembering.  And you'll go, like, and the phone rings.  You're like, oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, what did I write?  Now it's not just what did I do, it's what did I write?  What did I write?  Yeah, what is on permanent record somewhere now? 
[00:56:30]  Where?  No one gets drunk and pulls out a typewriter.  Fold, fold, pen, fold, ah, stamp, you know, mailbox.  Nobody.  No, no one does that.  Nobody pens a letter in anger.  Yeah, yeah.  But a tweet or an email or a text.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Do you think you'd be texting, like, your dick to everybody?  I'd Twitter it.  I'd Twitter it.  The fucking human body is beautiful. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, shit.  How'd you like this, cock?  Oh, to everyone.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that wouldn't go over well.  War is obscene.  This is not.  A picture of me with my fucking heart on in a mirror.  Making a social statement with your fucking dick.  Yeah, but it was not even a good shot.  Like, my fucking appendix got my baboon's stomach is in the shot.  Oh, shit. 
[00:57:30]  I don't know how you guys survive on Twitter, man.  It scares me.  There, yeah, yeah.  There's some.  I usually do keep my head about myself when I'm doing stuff that could get me in trouble.  Yeah.  And I mean, like, you know, jokes, racial jokes, things like that.  You got to kind of watch how you word them.  Sure, because on Twitter you don't have that.  There's no voice inflection or what else.  Yeah, yeah.  Sarcasm doesn't come across well.  That was easy.  You know what fucking amazes me? 
[00:58:00]  These idiots, though, that retweet something I said, and then it's just full of N-bombs and shit after they retweet it.  Yeah.  And they comment on it.  It's like, really?  You got to.  I fucking write something out and think about it and try to put it in some form that can be made a little clever.  I don't know.  And then somebody has to attach my name to that.  Yeah.  Fucking idiots.  Who would actually retweet somebody but change the quote? 
[00:58:30]  What kind of an asshole would. . .  Oh, that's right.  Oh, that's right.  I think I've done that.  Which is very funny.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That is hilarious.  Although, you know, you don't throw horribly offensive words in there.  It's that guy that you blocked last night, I guess.  I unblocked him.  Oh, you did?  I unblocked him.  Oh, because I blocked him.  He fucking. . .  He texts me or tweets me.  It's like, your buddy Jimmy blocked me because I made a joke.  So I'm like, all right. 
[00:59:00]  I check out his tweets and I see what he tweeted about you.  And I'm like, where's the joke?  Yeah.  The joke is just slamming Jimmy.  Yeah, he was slamming me.  So I just blocked him.  I was like, I'm going to fuck him.  And I blocked him.  But then when he was petitioning to be unblocked, I'm like, all right.  Maybe, like, at times, maybe the guy's a jerk off.  Or maybe legitimately, look, we've all. . .  Sometimes there isn't that inflection and you're just trying to be. . .  Like, we talk to each other harshly.  Yeah.  Like, I shut up. 
[00:59:30]  What are you. . .  We just. . .  We're harsh to each other.  Yeah.  So sometimes people are harsh to us and they're doing it in a tone that we do it.  It doesn't read like that.  So I just unblocked him.  And if he's a cunt again, I'll just block him.  But if not, then that was that.  He asked me to ask you to unblock him.  And I just blocked him.  I said, oh, no.  Now blocked.  So I guess now I have to unblock him.  I very. . .  No, I'll let you know.  We'll see how it turns out in the next few days.  Yes, he's on probation.  We'll see how it turns out.  You want to eat some food?  Yes.  And then, yeah.  And one of our friends lost a gig. 
[01:00:00]  Big tease, even though there's no time spent listening.  So it doesn't matter.  Yes, it doesn't matter.  Do what you want.  You know, we're going to talk about nothing.  So go away.  Don't come back.  We're talking about nothing.  None of your fucking business, what we'll be discussing.  We'll be back with nothing.  If you're here, you'll hear it.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony channel on Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we 
[01:00:30]  couldn't get.  Drummer and friend of Conan O'Brien and Bruce Springsteen, Max Weinberg.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Max Weinberg.  Max, do you prefer Google or Bing?  The interweb.  That's right.  Ah.  I'll have to get back to you on that.  Thank you so much for your time.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we couldn't get on the 
[01:01:00]  Opie and Anthony show.  Action.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, boy.  A little, um, glory days.  Glory hole.  Come on.  I know.  Amy Schumer.  Hi, Amy.  Good morning. 
[01:01:30]  I, uh, I follow Amy Schumer.  Not on Twitter.  I just follow her around.  I know.  Can you stop doing that?  Waiting for the restraining order.  It's getting really weird.  I, I follow you and, um, I, I was seeing pictures of you in strange lands.  Right?  Yeah.  What was that about?  I was in, I have a residency at the Riviera, the Starlight Room, that theater for the next  couple months.  Well.  So, I am setting up shop there and, uh, so I, yeah, I, I hiked the Red Rocks there and  then I'll, also I stole a huge motorized wheelchair for, uh, fat people and me and my opener rode 
[01:02:00]  around the casino for hours terrorizing people.  Yeah, I saw some, uh, video of you just, uh, driving around on that thing.  It was the funnest, it was the best time I've had forever.  Aren't those things great?  I know.  You don't, I can't believe how many people, I found how people use those that don't need  them and, and I understand why because they're so fun, but people, and also people don't know  if you're handicapped, so they're really nice to you.  Yeah, so they're nice.  They really can't be like, hey, you asshole. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, they don't assume that you're enough of a piece of shit to just ride around what  like actual crippled people need.  Right.  So, yeah, me and my friend, we just, we just took one of them because nobody knows what's  going on there and we just rode around.  And our thing was like trying to fit through the smallest spaces and just cutting people  off.  Like we were just the biggest douchebag.  And again, no one, no one says anything to you because they assume, well, you know,  maybe they're also mentally, you know, physically and mentally challenged.  I love just saying things where people think that maybe I'm, I'm actually handicapped in 
[01:03:00]  elevators and stuff.  Did you use the horn?  Oh my God.  We overused.  Oh yeah.  There's the video.  We took a lot of video of us just riding around, ruining lives, going into tiny stores, doing  eight point turns.  People were just like, oh, get out of here.  How annoying.  Oh, we're, we're the worst.  We are horrible people.  In Vegas, right?  Yeah.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We, we went to, um, where were we?  The Borgata and, uh, yeah, Danny was with a girl at the time whose leg was busted or something. 
[01:03:30]  I remember that.  She fucked her knee up pretty good.  What happened to the bitch?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What'd she do?  Uh, we went ice skating and she slipped, uh, and shattered her kneecap.  Oh no.  She got a text from an ex-boyfriend.  You threw her down.  Did you read the Rocky Pump tour?  I'd always be there to catch you.  It was completely, it was, no, it was completely legit and I, I happened to catch it on, uh, on  video as well.  So, man.  It shattered her knee?  Yeah, it was pretty, it was pretty fucked up. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, she was fucked up for a while.  Yeah.  And, like, you know what, I felt like shit at the time because, like, no one knew how  bad it was.  Because, you know, you fall, you know, you, you, you get your knee a certain way.  It hurts.  Yeah.  So, I didn't expect it to be all, you know, fucked up and stuff.  So, I was like, ah, you're fine.  Like, it blew up.  It's good.  But that's what it's going to do anyway.  It's going to get all big and swollen.  What a sweetheart.  So, I was just like, ah, fuck it.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Fuck it.  Turns out it's just completely shattered.  Yeah, she is one leg.  You should have said, it's going to get all big and swollen, and then grabbed your pole  like this puppy.  Oh, my God. 
[01:04:30]  That poor girl.  What a team player, though, that she still came to the Borgata.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I don't think she was too happy to have it.  No, probably not.  Yeah, no, she was not.  They gave her one of those scooter-y things, though, and we were racing it around the suite.  Really?  Not even out in the hallway or anything.  We were in the suite itself, racing from one room to the other room on the other side,  and then in between was the real thin spot between the table and the couch, and that  kept getting hit.  That's a gamble.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we were at the casino, so we're in that kind of a spirit. 
[01:05:00]  That's so fun, though, but I kept running into people in actual wheelchairs, and I would  just, but I would kind of look at them like, I know how it is, man.  Yeah, I know the struggle.  The best thing about the motorized wheelchair thing is that you could keep your extra booze in  the basket, so you don't have to keep going back up to the room.  That's right.  We figured out all the secrets.  It was pretty great.  Where'd you get it?  Did you just decide?  It was just sitting there, and I saw somebody stumbling over who needed it, and I said,  not on my watch.  Mine.  This is mine.  No, we saw a bunch of them, and we just turned it on and took it. 
[01:05:30]  They're recreational.  No one said anything.  Hours, we were gone.  I get pissy when I see somebody that's just fat in them.  Just fat people.  Oh, it's the worst.  And they're like, and all that fat is just hanging over it.  Yeah.  And they're just, and you just look on, really?  Not even an effort?  You need to walk more than anybody.  Yeah.  Yeah, and that's what we were on.  It fit both me and my friend.  Oh, you were on the fat people one?  We were on a fat person one. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, man.  It was sweet.  They make ones custom for just fat people?  They shouldn't do that.  I mean, I guess they should to make money.  It's fucking annoying.  Oh, look at that.  Where is that guy's cock?  There's just this big wall of fat in his basket, yeah.  But just look at him fucking lumbering along.  How does that happen?  How do you get to the point where you need wheels to drive you around?  His big fat feet are spread out.  I don't know.  His asshole must stink.  He probably has skin tags on his balls.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[01:06:30]  That is so hot.  What is with that humpty-dumpty shit they do?  You know, that big lump of fat.  It's like they're constantly doing a split.  Right.  I can't get my legs like that.  And their legs go completely out to the side with that big lump of fat that goes between the legs.  Never eating a salad.  Yeah.  Never.  Never an option.  Never see one of them having a fucking cucumber or something.  Oh, but if you ask them what they eat on a daily basis, I don't eat that much.  I don't eat that much.  I don't know what it is.  I don't.  It's something. 
[01:07:00]  I don't eat that much.  If I weren't going to be on camera, like sometimes, you know, I think I would let shit hit the fan and probably wind up.  You'd just be crazy?  Yeah.  I think it would get real bad real fast, to be honest.  It could.  It looks fun.  It's just like, why not?  Food is awesome.  Eating shitty food is great.  Oh, my God.  Such regret immediately, though.  I was talking about Ange bought some crumb cake.  Some delicious fucking crumb cake.  And I've gotten to the point where I wasn't.  I'm not even using a knife with it. 
[01:07:30]  I'm just picking it up and breaking a piece off and shoving it in my mouth.  And then when I get down to like the last couple of bites, I'm thinking I should grab another piece.  Yeah.  And this is I'm still on cruise vacation mentality where it was just eat, eat, eat.  And I really got it.  I really got to knock that shit off.  Oh, you went on a cruise.  Yeah.  That is where you will see the fat.  Like that's horrible fat people.  Well, just I mean, and they said it's set up perfectly.  It's just like the buffet.  It's just like a trough.  They just want to strap a feed bag to themselves. 
[01:08:00]  You're like, there's the oceans out there.  They're like, oh, no, thanks.  I'm cool.  No, this is the place I wanted to be.  It's the chocolate event at midnight.  And you actually went on one?  Yeah, I've gone on a couple of cruises.  I went one time with my grandma.  She had like a gambling problem and she would like mask it in.  Oh, I'm going to bring my granddaughter.  I would never see her.  She didn't even want to hang out with me.  Casino the whole time.  Yeah, she'd play craps the whole time.  I'd be like, grandma.  She'd be like, get away from me.  You're bad luck.  You're a mush.  Yeah, that was awkward. 
[01:08:30]  Did you enjoy the cruise?  Yeah, I did.  I was like still in college for that one.  And it was just the best time I can remember.  I was drinking port wine.  I didn't know that was just like an after dinner thing.  So I looked like a vampire just walking around.  But I remember I made out with this guy.  Yeah, didn't you make out with that guy?  I made out with the guy on the top deck of the cruise ship.  It was really late.  And it was awesome.  I remember like looking up at the stars, having a sweet orgasm, and then climbing back into 
[01:09:00]  bed with my grandma.  And I was like, I love cruises.  I should tour on a cruise line.  You didn't bang him?  No.  No.  He was wearing sandals with socks.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  That's it right there.  You know, it was like I was going to.  And then last second I caught a glimpse.  I was like, oh, shit.  Guy doesn't know how close he came.  This guy's in store for a bloge.  And that was it.  And that was all.  And that was all.  Yeah, they're pretty good.  But they do get your eating shit all fucked up where, you know, it's just okay to just 
[01:09:30]  shove pork down your fucking mouth.  They make you feel like that's what you're supposed to do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you get home and realize, you know, I better do something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I better scale it back.  Yeah.  You, uh, boy, you're one of these attractive, smart-ass-y girls on Twitter.  Have you noticed the influx of these?  What do you, what do you mean?  There's girls that are.  I mean, yes.  That describes.  They're too, they're too pretty to be funny.  But then they're funny. 
[01:10:00]  That's so nice.  Thank you.  On Twitter.  Well, you know, I, I observe these things.  Uh-huh.  It's my job.  Yeah.  I'm a huge wise-ass on there.  But there's, there's these girls that get, like, a lot of followers for no other reason.  And they're not in that category.  I mean, you're, you're a comic.  Right.  Uh, but there are just, you know, your regular girls that get these huge numbers just because  they'll talk about, you know, hey, my pussy itches today.  Yeah.  And you're like, fuck, she's hot.  She's talking about her pussy itching. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  It, it takes less.  You, you just have to be mildly funny.  Right.  And kind of, yeah, above average looking, because I think people just expect women to  just be these, like, just piles of stupidity and like, like, they just walk around bleeding  all over the place.  So when a girl's like, actually has something funny to say, they're kind of shocked.  But I think it's the same with like, um, with Palin, like, remember what she like had  when they had the big debate, everybody was like, well, she, you know, she didn't just  start crying.  And then that was celebrated.  Like, but, but really we should have to perform, you know, just as much as a guy. 
[01:11:00]  A little more.  Yeah.  But if you get a girl on Twitter that is willing to, to just talk dirty about herself and self  deprecating, very sexual innuendo and shit like that, but that's the stuff they would  never do out live in life, like in a, in, in a bar or something, when you're trying to  talk to a girl, it's just this, this kind of, you know, uh, you, you don't get that part 
[01:11:30]  of her.  Well, they're willing to open up on Twitter and talk about like, Hey boy, uh, scratch my  asshole the other day.  And you know, I was smelling my finger all day.  Really?  Were you?  You fucking ate.  Who is this girl?  I want to follow her.  Exactly.  There's so many of them.  That sounds like a winner.  There's so many.  Yeah.  They're like this, this thing.  It's like a, it's a thing.  It's an attractive girls that are willing to just talk about, uh, their awful, um, female  body parts.  My shirt's on inside out.  Is it?  Yeah.  I blew it. 
[01:12:00]  I'm the worst.  I'm just like, is this happening?  I'm like, Oh God.  Amy's a guy.  I'm really like, I think I over, somebody tweeted to me yesterday.  Um, I think you're an oversharer on here, Amy.  Cause yesterday I tweeted, I had to take plan B yesterday.  Oh yeah.  I saw the picture.  Oh nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You tweeted a picture of it.  And people were just like, how was the audition?  I didn't get it, but I did get a call back.  Yeah, but people were just like, Oh, you're disgusting. 
[01:12:30]  And I was like, I know I went into the pharmacy.  It's my pharmacy.  I go to every month and, um, it was just, I'm on, um, antibiotics.  So I forgot that makes your birth control like not, maybe not work.  And, uh, I don't, nobody wants a tiny Schumer coming into the studio.  So I was like, well, I better get it.  I went in and I was like, Hey guys.  And they were just like, Oh no.  Last night's makeup was like, it looked like I was melting.  And they just openly laughed at me like the pharmacy guys.  Cause they know me. 
[01:13:00]  They were just like, Oh, you suck.  I was like, just give it to me.  Pieces of shit.  So all the old people know somebody blew their cookies inside of you.  So awful.  So awful.  So where do you take that?  Does it make you sick?  Cause I knew a girl who took it once and she's like, she felt sick all day.  Or what does it make you feel like?  This was my second, uh, this was my second journey with, uh, with plan B, uh, which I'm apparently  using as plan a, um, and the first time I got really nauseous, but this time was fine. 
[01:13:30]  I went to yoga.  I went running.  I went running while I was getting some, some, somewhat of an abortion.  I was like, am I having a like 24 hour abortion right now?  Chemically induced abortion.  This is not positive.  Wow.  Yeah.  What a special.  And I, I, um, you know, I text the picture to the guy and I was like, miss you.  I was like, this is what I think about committing to starting a life with you.  Uh, God damn.  Yeah.  Don't they say you're not supposed to use that, uh, for birth control?  Yeah.  Of course not.  You can't, no, it can't be good for you. 
[01:14:00]  Like, but yeah, you know, not, nobody wants to see me breastfeeding.  But occasionally you got to just fucking Clorox the whole system out and fucking get rid  of any potential errors.  Yeah.  I hope it's getting rid of anything that was in there.  I'm sure there was some stuff happening.  Did you read the, uh, warning label?  Was there anything?  I did.  If you're pregnant.  But it's a beautiful package.  What is it?  A smiling, a smiling couple or?  It's a girl alone grabbing her hair.  Like, why?  And a guy doing jumping jacks in the background.  Oh God, yeah. 
[01:14:30]  A guy holding his bank book and smiling like 18 years of money.  We got it, Jim.  I, I started, um, you know, like when I go through a breakup right after, I just have  like tons of revenge sex, you know?  I'm like, let me try and free up this person.  That works.  It never works.  But that works for fucking up the guy's head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess.  She's just not fucking everybody.  It's like, that's right.  Just a revolving door.  No.  I, but honestly, this time I was like, I'm not going to do it.  But I did.  I started dating this guy and he was so, so paranoid about me getting pregnant. 
[01:15:00]  Uh, and it was like, we were using, uh, you know, I'm on the Nuva ring and he, we're  using a condom and he was pulling out.  I was like, I was like, it'll be Jesus.  Like if we create a baby, it'll be divine intervention.  But, uh, I was just, I had to end it with the dude.  Cause it was just so weird.  I was like, you're, you're like unemployed.  You're like starting a website.  You think I'm trying to like lay groundwork and roots with you, but some guys are really  paranoid about that.  So wait, he would wear a bag.  Yeah. 
[01:15:30]  Everything.  The Nagel is very paranoid about that.  Uh, back in the day, rumor has it, uh, Eric Nagel would go into the bathroom, uh, and,  and take his condom with him.  He would actually take the condom full of the Nagel seed golden, the golden Nagel seed  and, and put it in his pocket and take it with him because he was afraid the girl was  going to take it and like space food, squeeze it out into her vagina and impregnate herself  with the, the golden Nagel seed. 
[01:16:00]  What a megalomaniac.  Like who's scrapping to get your seed right now, Eric?  Come on.  The birth of the Prince Nagel.  Wow.  That is, I feel like that's what this guy was like.  And I was like, look, I don't even necessarily want to see you again.  You think I want to start a family with you?  I, I'm not even spending the night cause I don't want to wake up next to you.  You think I'm like, want a toddler with you?  Oh God.  Yeah, but guys, but there, but there are a lot of chicks that, that do that.  I mean, it's crazy.  So many fucking psychos.  I can't even, I can't even fathom it to be honest. 
[01:16:30]  I, you know, I'm a piece of shit in other areas, but that's like, but girls, I guess  do that.  Oh, there's so many fucking, so many needy fucking clingy zilches and anything they can, ah,  you gotta watch who you fuck.  You do.  And now with Twitter and everything, it's like, you, you don't know.  They'll just spout it out to the world.  I don't care about that.  I mean, I'll fucking, if they don't, I will.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Oh God.  You, uh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:17:00]  I don't know.  Yeah.  That is a scary thing.  You don't want, uh, your, your, your seed laying around like that for a later use.  I don't even know how long it lives in the condom.  Well, I did some research yesterday too, and, uh, it, I think it, it stays alive for  five days, five days, five days, boys, listen up.  It's gotta be inside you.  No, inside you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's swimming around.  It's trying to, it's looking for something.  Yeah.  Checking out alleyways.  Yeah.  Is that egg?  Yeah.  Come here, you mother.  Hey girl. 
[01:17:30]  Hey.  But in a condom, I wonder, uh, you know, it can't last that long.  Like what girl is going to like baste your ejaculate inside?  Probably everyone, Eric, everybody's just like, I want your baby.  And Eric, Florida money.  Did you, are you a trust fund kid?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  He's got plenty.  I'm a lottery winner.  He's got plenty.  Was there ever an instance, something that happened that made you go, Oh, I better start  taking my jizz with me or did you just assume that you were so fucking great? 
[01:18:00]  No, there, there was, uh, there was one time this girl was, was hanging out and, uh, we  didn't even do anything, but, uh, we would just watch a movie and everything.  And then she left and about 20 minutes, uh, later she, she calls and says, Hey, um, did  you put anything in my water?  And I said, what are you talking about?  And she goes, I'm, I'm not feeling good.  I can't focus.  Um, I don't remember like when I left and I said, it's just a night with Eric. 
[01:18:30]  You try blacking it out as soon as you're done.  You roofied her on movie night.  That's weird.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  So this is a doctor Titanic.  Yeah.  So I'm like, no.  And then she called again the next day asking this, you sure you didn't?  Cause I'm going to the doctor to get checked out.  And I'm like, I didn't fucking do anything.  You left.  You said goodbye to my parents.  You know, when she left.  Maybe your dad did.  Yeah.  Maybe your dad.  I heard your dad fucks a ton of girls. 
[01:19:00]  I heard happiness was about your dad.  Yeah.  It's a bio doc.  No, so it was just like, and this went on for a few days.  Like, she's like, my mom wants to talk to you.  I'm not talking to you.  How old were you?  How old were you?  Where did you find this girl?  I was 22.  Ugh.  Oh my God.  Just another clingy fucking idiot.  Yeah.  They're the worst.  Yeah.  But they're not all like that.  No.  Yeah.  No, I know you're not saying that, but I mean, but I mean, you really have to like, I feel  like if you know a chick, you know what she's going to be like. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Like you can see a little bit of the crazy coming at you.  The guys are fucked up though, because we kind of like a little bit of the crazy at  first, and then you realize it's attached to a, you know, it's not just the one little  carry on.  There's a, she goes, Oh, can we go to the carousel?  I have a few more things.  And then it's like, it's just rolling down the ramp, spinning, they're taking it.  You got to get the cart.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They go to the oversized bag area.  Oh God.  Yeah.  Not good. 
[01:20:00]  I think the only thing that I'm crazy about for real is sleep.  Like I want to get sleep.  And if somebody fucks with that, I become the exorcist.  But sleep is great.  Yeah.  I need sleep.  If not, but if I don't get it, I'll be a monster.  How much sleep do you need?  Not a lot.  I need five hours to function.  I'd like 20.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd like to sleep forever.  I like those days.  I could just fucking sleep until I'm disgusted with myself.  Yeah.  That I literally say it out loud.  I go, get out of bed. 
[01:20:30]  Fucking disgusting.  Yeah.  Just laying in your own filth.  I love it.  Oh, it's great.  Go back to sleep.  You wake up for a couple hours, watch a movie.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  Back to sleep.  Back in bed.  I love that.  Yeah.  But yeah, five hours is like the minimum.  Yeah.  Four, I'm worthless.  I've been here on like three.  Oof.  With drinking.  I had two last night.  It was 3.15.  I'm looking at the clock.  I just couldn't sleep.  Oh, that's bad.  Yeah, I couldn't sleep.  You get sleepy Jimmy at 10 o'clock.  Run, run.  Don't be fretting. 
[01:21:00]  Come on.  It's a wrap.  But man, drinking.  If I'm on a couple hours sleep, but I didn't drink, I'm kind of okay.  Yeah, yeah.  But if there's booze involved at all, then I'm worthless.  How do you function at all with that though?  It sucks.  You just like, but it's also funny, like getting up early, if you have to like do something  like this, you're all hung over.  It's kind of funny because you're so miserable, you don't care if you die.  So that just, that creates a sort of light air.  Takes the pressure off of anything.  Don't you get sick, like puke in the car or something?  I haven't puked from being hung over in like a really long time.  Wow, yeah.  But yesterday, I was really, obviously really hung over. 
[01:21:30]  I enjoyed a nice cocktail of plan B.  I had to get up.  I was working in Grand Rapids.  I had to get up on two hours of sleep, really hung over, drive to Detroit, two and a half  hours, return the rental car, fly home.  It was rough.  How do you do that?  Just by not respecting myself.  How do you like not just fucking fuck this and go back to, I could never do that.  I thought about starting a life in Grand Rapids.  Just, yeah.  Just like, you know what?  Put down some roots. 
[01:22:00]  I saw a help wanted sign at that diner.  What am I doing?  Telling jokes to strangers?  This is weird.  I feel like shit.  I really just need to sleep.  I just want to sleep and just start over here.  Could you sleep on the plane though?  I slept on the plane.  The guy next to me was trying to start a chat.  Oh God, shut the fuck up.  So, where are you going?  I just literally was like, nope.  Yeah.  Z, Z, Z, Z, Z.  Otto has the fucking best joke.  He's like the old guy.  He goes, where are we going?  Look at your ticket.  It's the same place we're all going.  This is a funny joke. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, the hangover thing.  I have the worst hangover.  If I'm just drinking a few beers, it's fine.  But if I really get tooled the night before, I cannot function.  It's a 24-hour hangover where I will be in writhing pain with a wet rag on my head.  Just, uh, fuck.  Puking.  And then, and then like, I won't feel like I'm going to puke.  And then 18 hours later, I'm puking going, what is this? 
[01:23:00]  Oh, I poisoned myself.  That's right.  Right, right.  You're like so shocked.  It's so unjust.  Why am I throwing up now?  Right.  From the poisoning of earlier.  This couldn't be from me abusing my liver.  No, not at all.  I've, uh, I've been very good with coming in here.  There was a little phase I was going through for a while where I was coming in here really  hungover.  And, uh, oh boy.  There, there were a couple of times I would do the live read and you'd hear a gulp in the 
[01:23:30]  middle of it.  And makes, and make sure you go just sweating.  And then, ah, I got to go to the bathroom.  Blat.  Blat.  The aunt never goes to piss.  Never.  So whenever he's gone for more than a few seconds.  It really does.  I don't know how you do it.  Those sit here for four hours is a lot of piss.  I piss my pants.  Oh, good boy.  Yeah, that's good.  I knew I liked your scent.  Nice.  Sometimes though, a dump is in order in the bathroom there.  I don't like doing that.  I like the home field advantage, but, uh, sometimes I'll do that. 
[01:24:00]  But, uh, yeah, I guess it was about probably a year ago or so where I stopped kind of doing  that coming in here really fucking torched.  Danny would just look at me and go like, oh yeah.  Like Danny would know.  Half the time I was right there with you.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you have to shit on a plane?  Either one of you?  Have you ever shit?  I was just going to ask you that.  Wow.  I swear I was just going to ask you that.  I think once I've shit on a plane.  I'm trying to think.  I don't think I've ever taken a dump on an aircraft.  I'll drop heat anywhere.  Yeah? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, anywhere.  You shit anywhere, really?  I, I, one time I had to go on a plane.  It was bad.  Wow.  It was, I was hung, I was hung over and sick.  I had some sort of a virus.  Uh.  I came out and the flight attendant just looked at me and I was like, fuck you.  You think I wanted to do this?  Oh, fucking Kenny?  Well, Kenny can't not shit?  We were on a prop.  Oh, no.  It's worse.  Oh, no.  That's the whole cabin.  A prop.  And I had been flirting with the flight attendant, which I never flirt with the flight attendant,  but she, I was like, she's fucking sexy.  And then she came over and she's like, I'm a big fan. 
[01:25:00]  I'm like, oh.  Oh, man.  Music.  Come on.  So we're stopped at the fucking gate.  We land.  And there's some kind of problem.  And, and the fucking bathroom is at the door.  Oh, no.  And all the passengers are standing up and Kenny's like, I gotta use the bathroom.  So he sneaks in.  Oh, no.  And fucking just causes damage.  Gross.  And then he opens the door and it just fucking rips.  And she has to stand.  She still has to smile and ask him if he wants a beverage. 
[01:25:30]  No, we all think you're off the plane, but it's, everybody had to walk through.  It was fucking, I don't know how he did it.  I would have shit my pants before I did that.  That's horrible.  You should not be allowed in society.  No.  It was a fucking horrible dump.  Wow, that is gross.  That's the worst part of, I would guess, about taking a dump on a plane, even a big plane,  because it's right up front there where they're working and doing their food stuff.  And when you walk out, that's going to waft.  He's going to get out to the pilots.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Taking a turn.  Leaves the fucking mic on.  What if someone take a big fucking shit back there?  Jesus Christ, it breaks.  Think I got cancer?  Oh.  Yeah, that's, um.  That would be embarrassing.  Then you'd just be the guy that shit on the plane.  Like, the flight attendants would be like, yeah, it's the guy that shit.  That's the guy.  Yeah, he wants a beverage.  It's a 3E.  But also, people who fart on the plane, I want to punch them in the face.  Like, I will glare at someone and just be like, I know. 
[01:26:30]  How do you know it's them?  I know it was you.  And then I just look, and their shoes are just off.  I'm like, okay, that makes sense, too.  Oh.  Are you a fart, guy?  Oh, boy.  Ew.  I've dropped such farts.  I told you, me and Florentine were on a plane one time.  Oh, Jesus.  And my fart, we were in first, we upgraded the first.  You're like Al-Qaeda.  My fucking farts were so atrocious that Florentine went up to the bathroom, and the fucking flight  attendant thought his shit smell was reeking out and spritzed outside the fucking door. 
[01:27:00]  That is so gross.  Oh, man.  And then later, they're walking by our chairs, and the fart reeks so bad, she actually backed  up and spritzed at our seats.  At you.  At our fucking seats.  It's one of my greatest accomplishments.  No.  Did you guys, were you crying and laughing?  They knew it was us.  I mean, me and Jim, they know it's us, because all they see is newspapers.  He's shaking.  He's trying to hide your face when you're convulsing in the seats.  Who else could it be?  Two fucking assholes with upgrades and Sabbath shirts. 
[01:27:30]  It wasn't the guy in the suit and fucking 2B.  Oh, my God.  It was fucking huge.  And it's one of my, and I really mean this.  Oh, wow.  As we're all, because they were these fucking like, those fucking hot ones that were atrocious.  We're getting off the plane, and we're all standing there to get off.  We're standing in the line to get off.  And it was, again, waiting for the door to open.  And I had one building.  And I'm like, oh, my, I got to do it. 
[01:28:00]  And Florentine's like, you got to do it.  You got to do it.  Let it go.  And I held it in, because I knew I would burst out laughing, and it would have been so vile.  And I swear to you, it's one of my great regrets.  I did not drop that far in that line.  You didn't do it?  No, because I was afraid that it would cause, like, they would actually penalize us and threaten.  I'm not kidding.  I thought I'd get in trouble for it.  Sometimes it does qualify as an assault.  Yeah.  It's just, it's so bad that there's no difference between that and lighting some type of device that makes that smell and assaults you. 
[01:28:30]  It is an assault.  Yeah, it was, it's a great regret.  That was probably 10 years ago, maybe more.  And you still remember.  He's still, it's eating out of him.  I'll never forget him going, you got to do it.  You got to, you got to drop it.  Come on, man.  Let it go.  Why did you not listen to him?  I don't, it's a, because I knew I would just, I knew that the, the, because we were still standing there, and I knew everybody would know who it was.  Yeah.  And the laughter just. 
[01:29:00]  God damn it.  Because Jim is really good at not, like, Jim will just, like, smell it and go like, oh, man.  But he cannot laugh.  Really?  Jim cannot laugh.  And I, we were one time years ago to Lancaster, and I was in the fucking store with him, and there's a big fat cashier, and he's handing her something, like money, and he rips a really loud fart.  And I'm standing there, and I'm shaking, and I look over, and Jim and the cashier are staring at me, like, come on, man. 
[01:29:30]  Like, get it together.  Like, how could you do that?  Oh, wow.  I'm like, he never breaks.  No.  Wow, that's talent.  Yeah.  That's because he's a sociopath.  Yeah, he really is.  He's not.  Kenny doesn't break either, though.  I know.  Well, again, sociopath.  He's not a human being, which is why.  We took, he took me, I got upgraded one time, because he always flew first when we worked with Dice, and I got upgraded, so Kenny wanted us to sit together.  So he took me up to the seat 1B instead of 5, and he goes to the lady, he goes, Miss, can we switch with you?  Because my nephew's incontinent. 
[01:30:00]  He's not an entire lie.  And I started laughing, and then she wouldn't switch to those.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, she wouldn't switch?  You blew it.  No, because she told me we were fucking around.  I'm like, why don't you tell me you were going to say that?  My nephew's incontinent.  There's such a skill.  I hate the stress of not having the seats together and having to wait.  Yeah.  Because you can't relax until you finally sort that out.  It's like, who's coming in?  Is it going to be the guy that's an asshole? 
[01:30:30]  And then there's like the, it shouldn't matter to him at all, because obviously he's not sitting with anybody.  Right.  If I'm in this seat, somebody else.  Yeah.  So it's like, can we switch seats?  Window, window, aisle, aisle is fine.  But you want somebody to give up an aisle seat, that's hard.  Yeah, you can't.  Well, Jimmy, you don't understand.  A lot of people do like the window.  Mm-hmm.  Unless they got a real, you know, unless they're incontinent.  I like a good window seat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Especially in first, you get like three of them. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, you put that seat back.  I got the whole side of the plane.  I can look at it.  It's panoramic.  I'll tell the guy, like, if, uh, the only time I wouldn't switch was one time.  It was a couple, because I had an aisle seat, and they wanted me to switch the window.  Well, uh, they were, actually.  One of them.  Okay?  One of them.  Even worse.  Not doing them any favors.  No, but I, I said to the guy, I said, I would prefer to stay in an aisle, um, because I  pee constantly.  I'd say, but if you can't get anybody to the switch, I will do it.  So I would have given up the seat.  Yeah.  And I think I actually helped him find a switch.  You got someone else? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  You know, that's, uh, that's tough, though.  I don't like moving.  I like other people moving for me.  Yeah.  I don't like moving for anybody else.  I don't mind moving if it's, like, an aisle for an aisle.  I'll always do that.  But, like, the flight attendants, they'll be, like, those last two rows that they put  the trays down, and their bags.  Yeah.  And you could have a whole row.  So now what I do, I just go back there, I put up the trays, I'll move their bag over,  and I will take that row.  Wow.  Because I fly all the time.  I'm not in first class.  I'm in the back with all the scaries.  Oh, Amy. 
[01:32:00]  I know.  I know.  And I just, but I take the whole row, and I sleep my, I sleep the booze off.  How do you let guys unload in you, yet you still can't fly first?  These guys should be doing something.  Oh, I've never banged anyone with money.  Oh.  Yeah, no.  That's never happened.  Is that religious?  Yeah.  I just, I have my belief system.  How about you find somebody with miles?  I would, yeah.  Yeah, seriously.  That would be the weight of my heart right now.  My vagina's taking a vow of poverty.  Yeah. 
[01:32:30]  I've been upgrading like half the time, but it's so hard to go back to the coach after,  I mean, you guys don't have to worry about it, but.  That's not true.  I mean, for years and years and years I upgraded.  Yeah.  I got so many miles now, because Kenny does the flights in advance.  Yeah.  Usually you can fucking use miles to upgrade in advance.  Yeah.  It really is just special up there.  It changes the game.  I just started upgrading and staying in nicer hotels, and I'm just like nicer as a person.  Oh, you're making that little notch up a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You stop being afraid that you're not going to make enough. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  I'm like, people are showing up to see me.  I don't have to battle bed bugs at this point.  Yeah.  Let's just put me somewhere that the sheets don't feel like paper.  Louis C.K. told me he would do that.  He goes, fuck, I don't care how much it costs.  He goes, I fly first, and I fuck it.  He goes, and I just tell them to take it out of my pay.  This is years ago.  Yeah.  I guess he wanted to, he didn't care if it went to him or his wife.  I don't know why he did it, but he didn't give a fuck.  He's like, it's just, it's part of the trip for me, and it makes it life bearable.  It does.  Do you have to mention his name on this show?  I'm disgusted with Louis C.K. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, I don't care for Louis.  Oh, my God, the language.  Poo poo, Lou.  Yes, indeed.  I can't believe that.  That persona non grata here.  Yes.  I'll tell you that much.  That fucking dumb Greta Van Susteren.  But a typical media person, he said something I don't like.  Meanwhile, and I even Twittered to her, I'm like, you made a, you have a career, because  you talked every day about a guy who murdered his wife.  Like, it's amazing, the fucking hypocrisy in these people.  The morally bankrupt people.  Oh, they stink.  I'm sure she justifies it some way in her head. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, she does.  Because her husband, I think, works as an advisor for Palin.  And Louis did on Twitter call Palin a cunt or whatever, but that's Louis.  It's what he does.  Yeah, yeah.  Cares.  But, you know, everybody, you can't stop someone from having judgments because they're a piece  of shit.  Like, yesterday, I was literally in line to get the morning after pill, and I saw somebody  buying, like, all these candy bars, and I was like, ew.  And I was like, oh, wait, I'm a whore.  Like, everyone's going to judge and make these.  People love to be angry at somebody.  They like to get something done.  Yeah.  That's why I think we're spoiled, because we're used to, like, asking mommy and daddy 
[01:34:30]  for something and getting it done.  So we don't know how to just object from afar anymore and go, I don't care for that.  I'm not going to do that.  We want other people to not do it, because it's that spoiled little fucking kid thing.  Yeah.  But that's what it is.  But, you know, people just don't go, ah, that stinks.  I'm not going to watch that.  We don't want you watching it either.  Yeah.  Right.  But, Louie, you know what?  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  No, no.  I was going to talk about Louie.  I think Louie was hesitant about that gig anyway, to be honest with you.  I'm not saying he didn't want to do it, but Louie's a fucking harsh comic.  Right.  Yeah.  Like, and what's in it for him to do that, really?  I think it's one of those things that, like, it's kind of a big thing to do if you're 
[01:35:00]  a comic, you know.  You perform for the president.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Never mind.  That's the White House Correspondents Center.  Damn.  That's Obama sitting right there.  Wow.  And he's like, I don't want to do it anymore.  That's nuts.  Yeah.  I'm kind of glad he just instantly pulled out like that.  Oh, did he pull out?  Without saying, like, you know, well, I'm going to try, you know, or trying to make excuses.  Like, what?  This?  Okay.  Bye.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  I'd love to ask about that.  I personally think, he said something to me about it, like, that's a weird gig, but 
[01:35:30]  he didn't say he didn't want to do it, but he's like, ugh, that's a weird.  Yeah, that's weird.  I forget what he said, but it indicated that he knew that, like, Seth Meyers destroyed on  that thing.  Yeah.  It was all, like, political humor, and, like, Louie's fucking, could do political humor.  He's fucking, he's a hardcore man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's not cute.  He likes the truth.  Yes.  There's no little cuteness.  He can't soften things up.  That's not him.  No.  No sweetness.  And who wants to walk into that situation where even Obama, like, if it was, if there  was, like, the big thing was, oh, he called Palin a cunt, even Obama couldn't be seen 
[01:36:00]  enjoying him because then people are like, Obama, like, well, how could you do this with  this?  Right.  You just, you called this woman after Rush said that, and then he calls her a cunt, and you're  enjoying it.  And I think Louie did the right thing.  It's, it was the right move.  Yeah.  This, this whole fucking atmosphere, though, we're, we're, we're really getting crazy now.  The Rush thing, Louie.  I mean, now they're just looking for people.  They're going back years to see what people said.  Bill Maher, you know, what he said, and it's like, well, Bill Maher contributed to Obama's 
[01:36:30]  state.  Now it's like six degrees of fucking who you called a cunt.  So he fucking gives a shit.  Just, you know, they, the, first of all, they're comics or entertainers, even Rush Limbaugh.  He's not a fucking, they call him like a, the, um, de facto leader of the Republican party.  And he shouldn't say that.  And that's the difference between him and Bill Maher.  What?  It's just slow news.  It's like, everybody gave a shit about Kurt Cameron.  Who gives a fuck with that? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, I know.  Who cares?  How could you?  Let's protest outside his church or, I don't know what he does.  He doesn't like gay people.  Who cares?  Leave him alone.  Let him hate gay people.  Who cares?  And he was asked.  Growing pains.  He wasn't going around going, I hate gay people.  He's asked, hey, how about those gay people?  Oh, yeah.  He's like, no, thanks.  Everyone's like, how could you?  Why is he a, he's not a political figure.  Then don't ask if you don't want to know somebody.  Like when they, when they, when they fucking got cunt Perez Hilton asked.  Yeah.  Miss America.  I didn't like her.  Carrie Pragyne or whatever. 
[01:37:30]  I thought she was a twat.  Yeah.  But he asked.  Yeah.  Don't ask her and then be mad because she doesn't like what you are.  Outraged at the answer you don't like.  If she offered it, then you're like, what the fuck?  I'm right here.  That's one thing.  But she didn't.  He asked her.  Yeah.  You're allowed to feel however you feel.  It's not like the old Anita Bryant days where she would just go around yelling how horrid  gays are.  And by the way, radio fucked themselves because now there's, I think there's 98 major companies,  car companies that will no longer advertise these cowardly motherfuckers  on shows like Rush.  Really? 
[01:38:00]  Yep.  On controversial shows.  All our fucking car commercials are going to be gone now.  I know.  Oh, that's right.  We don't have a one.  Dick Creams.  Ball deodorant.  Ball deodorant.  Every day.  Yeah.  Shit like that.  Ball deodorant.  Hey, your nuts will smell great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fresh balls.  Yeah.  That's a wee...  There's no Toyota being plugged on here.  Yeah.  Well, we wanted to take, you know, Ford, but fresh balls is in the way.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  Those political shows now are not going to get those guests.  I mean, those talk shows because like Mike Savage and all that, they're not going to 
[01:38:30]  get that advertising.  So radio, you fucking have fucked yourself so good.  I love it.  It's just so random, the snippet or the clip that's picked out.  That does it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the stuff you don't even see coming, you know?  Yes.  Like what happened to Bill Maher or even like what happened to me on the roast.  Yes.  Yeah.  Like that joke about Steve-O, that wasn't a big deal in the room at all.  Right.  But they cut to him looking sad and then all of a sudden, you know, you don't know what  the big deal is going to be.  So I think because you have so little control over when that happens, you can't be worried 
[01:39:00]  about it.  But nobody, people got to start defending each other because it's like when you, when  somebody is fucking smashing you and people are coming to your defense, it means something.  It does.  But it's like everybody just sits there and watch everyone else's dick swing in the wind.  And then when it happens, it starts, we're like, what is it?  I do appreciate that about you.  Yeah, but everybody does that.  I know that's not why you do it, but it really meant a lot to me that you like defended me.  Well, we're friends.  I mean, it's like, it almost doesn't count with you because you're a good friend.  It's like friends are going to help.  You're among friends. 
[01:39:30]  You're among friends.  But still, you don't know when, when people are in trouble, that's when people you thought  were friends, like hide out, like, oh, that looks bad.  I'll call you in a couple months, you know, but, but I appreciate it.  But any comment that didn't do that is just a fraud.  Like, it's not, it's like by defending other people, like in that realm, you're not being  special.  You're just not being a cunt fraud.  It's the guys that run for cover.  They're just cunt frauds.  Yeah.  It's a, it's a situation where you, you, how could you not defend somebody and be in that  the same industry? 
[01:40:00]  But they try to do it.  Like it's all, it's all very political.  Like there's not going to be any one of these liberal Democrat guys that are going to come  out and defend rush.  Right.  Bill Maher did, but well, I heard Maher did.  I didn't hear the rant, but I heard he really, because he was getting shit on about what  he said.  Right.  Uh, but that's the, that's the time to not pull that shit, you know, and, and because  eventually you're going to say something, they're going to pull that snippet and you're fucked.  Slow news day.  And then you're the hot button.  That's all it takes.  But nobody defends people who say shit. 
[01:40:30]  They don't.  And it's like, I watched it with the rush thing and on Twitter and even a lot of our fans have  reasons as to why they thought that what happens to rush with like, you know, the losing the  advertisers and all this is okay.  And they, they use the free market argument.  Right.  Well, he's not being arrested and that's not what free speed.  And it's like the free market argument is nobody listens to him.  Yeah.  His ratings go away and people don't advertise.  Right.  But you jumping the gun and go, you have the right to do that.  I didn't say people don't have the right to protest him, but why would you want to? 
[01:41:00]  That to me is the problem.  Yeah.  Why would you want to like, why wouldn't you just not like what he said?  And who cares?  It's just dumb.  Like to even answer that, that shit that gives it power.  Like just let it, who gives a shit?  Yeah.  Just leave it.  Let it sit there.  Yeah.  Just let him put it in the ether and then make your mind up about him.  But to start a rally, I just, maybe it's cause I'm super lazy.  I just can't imagine trying to start a movement against somebody in the media.  Most people are super lazy except for those people that aren't. 
[01:41:30]  And they're usually the assholes that want their own fucking, uh, opinions.  And if they're different, uh, you should be off the air.  Yeah.  I, I never understood that.  Yeah.  It's a, and it's like you said, why, why fucking, why even protest it?  I don't get the desire to do it because I, I hear stuff I don't like all the time and  I've never wanted anybody to get in trouble.  It's in your headphones right now.  Absolutely.  It's utter shit.  Yeah.  I, I, I just, uh, I think what Rush said is nothing, nothing. 
[01:42:00]  And he's not the de facto leader of the Republican body.  He's an entertainer.  Whether he's entertaining or not is, you know, your opinion.  Um, and if you don't find him entertaining, you don't listen, but you know, people just  don't get that.  Don't listen thing.  People don't like someone to have more, more influence than they have.  They resent a person whose voice is louder than theirs.  So when that person says something objectionable, they try to have that voice brought down.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  Like they just don't like someone else being heard more than them. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  And I like the excuse about, you know, being the de facto leader of the Republican party,  uh, and Bill Maher's an entertainer.  Well then how come entertainers are getting in trouble too?  Right.  You know, so we get a free patent.  No, because you know, we don't like you either.  But it's because everyone has such an inflated sense of self now because of the, the, all  the access, Twitter, Facebook, to have a website used to have to be famous.  Now you're a 14 year old posting pictures of your dance and they just, Comedy Central  just did that, um, this, uh, study and they found that 60% of people think that they could 
[01:43:00]  be comedians.  Oh my God.  60% of people are like, I can do what you do.  So when, when people like write, people will write to me and be like, why are you verified  on Twitter?  You're not famous.  And I'm like, you know who I am and you have three followers.  Like, why are we having this conversation?  You know, but people, yeah, they just get outraged.  I think because they feel they, they could be in that position doing a better job.  Yeah.  I guess that's, yeah.  Yeah.  People are dumb. 
[01:43:30]  I think they think everyone sucks.  I think they think they want to do comedy.  Thanks.  I don't know if they think they can.  Maybe they lied in the survey.  I believe the survey, but I believe that they were just in a survey going, yeah, you know  what, I, my friends tell me I'm pretty funny.  I mean, you think about the guys you work with on the road.  Sometimes you're like, why don't you go back to school?  What are you doing here?  They're like, do you think I should move to New York?  I'm like, no.  Stay in Omaha.  Can you drive a train?  Oh, God.  I don't know.  New York, LA.  Here.  You're fine here.  Yeah. 
[01:44:00]  Okay.  Enjoy Virginia Beach forever.  Troy has a friend, by the way, coming in today.  Yes.  What time is she coming?  She's here.  Oh, she's here.  Okay.  Ah.  She's a big fan of yours.  Oh, really?  I don't know if she's done, I think she started doing stand-up.  Oh, no.  After I just talked all that shit.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's what you should because if she wants to come in here, and she does, and maybe do  a little of her act.  Oh, is that what's happening?  I don't know, actually, what she's going to do.  She might be too nervous, or she might just talk.  I don't know.  I don't either, but that's what I hear.  But she's a big fan.  Okay. 
[01:44:30]  I hear.  One of Troy's friends, right?  Yeah.  Well, I hope she's funny.  And, yeah, yeah.  You know?  Yeah, let's, you know.  I feel like you guys are setting me up for horrible.  No, no, no.  You're not rich.  No.  You're not rich boss.  We break, hand to tinkle.  Yeah, we'll take a break.  Can I plug?  No, Jimmy.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, I'll be in Orlando, and what's the fucking date?  Yeah, March 29th through April 1, Caroline's here in New York.  Ooh!  That's actually selling much better than I thought it was, and so is Orlando.  People love you.  I wouldn't go that far. 
[01:45:00]  I think there's just a lot of people in town who wanted something to do.  People are bored.  I'm going to that one.  That's like a block away.  I'd like to say on March 24th, I'll be at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, and I'm going  to be at South by Southwest all week with pale Robert Kelly.  Damn!  Yeah.  Oh, the festival?  Yeah, I'm going tomorrow.  Oh, cool.  South by Southwest.  You know, Amy, then he's going to get all fucking...  You know, dude, I want to see him in a cowboy hat so bad.  Oh, man.  Please let them make one big enough.  I want to see him with a saddle on his back.  I cannot imagine.  It's like 85 degrees there. 
[01:45:30]  I just want to see him sweating all over that festival.  I want to see him with a hat like Midnight Cowboy.  Oh, God.  Exactly.  Couldn't think of somebody who got killed in a hat.  Dude!  Where are you two nights?  I can't wait.  I can't wait.  Are you doing the fucking anti-social tour with...  Me, Artie, Nick DiPaolo, and Dave Attell are in Connecticut at Foxwoods for that show.  June 9th? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, tickets are on Ticketmaster, but I'm just wondering where you were.  Bonnaroo.  Oh, cool.  Have fun.  All right.  Bye.  Oh, great.  Enjoy.  Bye.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And in Vegas, I'm there the next couple of months for a week at the Riviera.  That's really cool.  That is really fucking cool.  I'm there when Dice isn't there.  Oh!  Hey!  Hey!  I keep stealing all his merchandise.  Oh, I heard about that.  Yeah.  I'm going to be away, but some who is coming in.  I get to be there when he's not.  I do his whole act.  I smoke a cigarette.  That'd be good. 
[01:46:30]  But come to the Riviera.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Old Vegas showroom.  Actually, I want to do something after I shoot.  Bring your own Plan B.  Yeah, God.  I'm going to take it before.  That is BYO Plan B.  Yeah, BYOPV.  God damn it.  Yeah, get Plan C and D ready.  Oh, shit.  Come on, Chip, please.  Oh, shit.  Please, Chip.  Stupid.  You really know how to make us go to break, don't you?  I'm going to cut myself.  I guess Troy's pal.  Oh, God, he's doing a forearm thing.  Isn't that uncomfortable? 
[01:47:00]  That is awful.  It's terrible.  I feel bad.  I want to shower it out.  Yeah, it's terrible.  You don't like the elbow?  That is awful.  No, I hate it.  The chip drum.  And his hand kind of almost hits you.  I got out like 40 times at the fucking table.  Oh, God, he wouldn't stop.  At the table.  Nobody likes that.  No one likes that.  We'll take a break, and then, yeah, Troy's friend will come in, and we'll see what she's all about.  We have Will Ferrell at 940.  Oh, he's a big star.  He's a star.  A star.  All right, I'll be right back. 
[01:47:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Let me show you how to make a big boy love you. 
[01:48:00]  In today's episode, Uncle Paul talks about his career as a foley artist.  Yeah, I did foley work.  Sure.  Like you take your hand and you put her L on it.  That sounds like the baby's bottom getting kissed.  How do you make the sounds of skiing?  You just blow into his hiney.  Whoosh.  Whoosh.  Yeah, you yank his little privates.  And when his feet are kicking your chest, you tug his private parts.  That sounds like the tribal drums.  Who's that old guy over there? 
[01:48:30]  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul, now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, because here comes Uncle Paul.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We're back. 
[01:49:00]  We're back.  Hello.  We're back.  Just jacking off on pal talk.  That's right.  And in here.  It's amazing.  It's just fucking amazing.  Amy's wearing her scarf and jacket.  Are you really getting a breeze?  I asked when you left.  I am.  Look at this.  See the papers are offline?  Is somebody staring at Amy's tits and making her uncomfortable?  I actually asked that when you left.  No, actually, I'm bummed.  Nobody was looking at my tits.  My tits are getting no heat in here.  Oh, you actually were just called.  Okay.  Yeah, do you see?  All the papers are flying.  There's like a wind just on me in here. 
[01:49:30]  That's just because guys are talented enough to just look when you look away.  I'm going to look away when you look.  Amy looks like Karl Lagerfeld with her fucking scarf.  Oh my God, I'm giving a break, you guys.  Her scarf and her shirt.  Oh my God.  Please, let's not go around the room.  All right.  Amy, have you seen the commercial with the comic that's up, this female comic?  And she's like, hey, how about our periods, ladies?  No, I have not seen that.  It is so bad.  I can relate to that.  I get my period every month.  See?  So it's relatable to me. 
[01:50:00]  It's got to be good.  I haven't seen it.  Is it real hokey?  It's really bad.  She's a female comic?  Do I know her?  No, I think she's just an actress trying to play one.  That's who they hire to do those.  Yeah, yeah.  Not real comics.  No.  Because a real comic would go, I can't.  No, that's not how you do it.  An actor will just do what they tell them.  Yeah, they'll just give them the lines.  They do an impression of a comic, which is really insulting because it's always this really  corn ball.  It really is.  Who's from out of town?  You're like, is that what you think of us?  I don't know why.  Like stand-up comics are now being used a lot.  Like fake ones.  Yeah.  Actors. 
[01:50:30]  In a few commercials, I've been noticing this happening lately, some people.  And it's so obvious they're not comics.  Right.  They're terrible.  I like the one for, what is it, the general car insurance?  Where a guy is just standing there going, hey, I had a little run-in with a truck and  I lost.  And you hear like, ah, ha, ha.  It's like it wasn't even for what?  I wonder if I joke.  That's so obvious.  That's only funny if a guy in a wheelchair is telling that joke.  That would be great.  Oh, speaking of Florentine not breaking, did you see his show with Don Jameson? 
[01:51:00]  Oh, hold on.  I know.  That's Eric.  That's Eric.  Oh, actually, we know this guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's actually.  Oh, no.  It's terrible.  Why would he do this?  His name is, what's his name?  Eric Rivera.  Eric Rivera.  Yeah.  He's a nice guy and he's the host of The Cellar.  Oh, no.  He's the host of The Cellar.  The commercial is awful.  I'm sure he knows it.  Oh, it's a terrible commercial.  Shoot.  Let's hear it.  Tell you what's not funny, driving without insurance.  The other day, me and my little car in this SUV tried to use the same lane at the same  exact time.  I lost.  Oh, man.  The dubbed in laughter. 
[01:51:30]  That hurts.  That is awful to watch.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's terrible.  I'll tell you what's not funny, driving without insurance.  Smiling the whole time.  There's no, Eric's like hoping no comic sees that.  That would be funny if the driver for the limo that was going the wrong way down the express  place if he got into stand-up and told that joke.  Well, that fucking lady on the Taconic.  On the Taconic.  Oh, no.  You know what's not funny?  Slugging booze and then hopping into a minivan. 
[01:52:00]  Why would you take that gig?  Here's one of the YouTube comments.  Oh, no.  Now I lost it.  Really?  Why would you take that?  I'll tell you what's not funny.  You're acting.  Oh, my God.  People are brutal.  People are cold-blooded.  They're brutal.  They're not going to...  And that's not his act, of course.  No, I would assume it isn't, but then people just kind of know him.  People are going to think that's like your stuff.  The general...  Then there...  I don't know what that other thing is for.  It's definitely for a tampon or something, but there's a female comic in some kind of 
[01:52:30]  a tampon commercial.  Period thing.  Yeah, what is the breeze?  I'm sorry.  I don't want to be a pain in the ass, but it's really only on me.  It's a strong...  Like, the perfect storm is headed to me.  I've never seen the papers...  It's a strong wind just at me.  I feel like you guys are...  Going around, yeah.  The papers are shuffling.  We don't punk people by putting breezes on them.  Yeah.  Worst prank of all time.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, let's see how much clothes we can get Amy to put on.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  Amy doesn't know.  I have a full burka.  You guys are like, we got her!  Yeah.  Like, this was the worst prank.  There was a sand in the corner blowing air.  It was the worst.  What?  It's from Maxi Pad?  Maxi Pad?  Do people still wear pads?  That's just it.  I was like, what?  Really?  It's a Kotex commercial?  Oh, no.  Yeah?  Look for Kotex stand-up comic commercial.  Oof.  Girl thing.  Oof.  Because that one's really bad, too.  This is what people...  Because she's trying to be like this real hip kind of comic.  This is what people think female comics talk about. 
[01:53:30]  Hey, girls.  Hey, ladies.  People always thank us.  Chelsea Prady has a whole funny thing about, like, that people would be like, thank you  for not talking about your period.  Like, they think that's what we do.  That's what you do.  That doesn't even happen anymore.  That's so hacky.  Was there a female comic that that was their thing, and that's where the stigma came from?  I don't even mind if it's funny.  Yeah.  Like, it's something that we don't...  I wouldn't mind hearing about fucking how it smells like copper.  Or fucking...  How about fucking selfies you ruined?  Like, I'd love to hear that.  What the hell are they saying? 
[01:54:00]  That would be a great list of the top five pieces of furniture I've ever ruined on my  period?  Yeah.  I'd love to hear that.  The top five.  That would be a really funny shoot.  Me in five different locations, like, kind of smiling.  Yeah.  It's ruining this couch.  I left a Rorschach test here.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they call Amy the paintball kid.  That's what they call me.  No.  I had a joke about it.  I like that I would...  Well, I don't remember what it was.  It was something like that I would have sex with the guy when I'm a period and pretend  like I was a virgin. 
[01:54:30]  I'd be like, oh, no.  Oh, that's a good one.  Oh, ow.  Sorry.  I should have told you.  Ow.  And they were like, yeah, right.  There she is.  Oh, no.  Stand up for...  Who is this?  Oh, I know this girl.  You do?  She's not a comedian.  She's an improv chick.  Okay.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  Let's see it.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Newsflash.  Sometimes my period's not awesome.  But you know what helps?  Those ads that are like 60 times sportier, says the cheerleader.  Or 500% better, says the sexy lab technician. 
[01:55:00]  Or 300% more zen, says the yoga teacher who's wearing all white.  Wait a minute.  Go back.  Yeah, go to the beginning because it's...  Hold on.  The beginning is the worst part.  Gosh, sometimes my period's not awesome.  Oh, she's doing Sarah.  Yeah, yeah.  She's doing Sarah.  Those ads that are like 60 times sportier, says the cheerleader.  Yeah, she's totally doing Sarah.  Totally.  Or 500% better, says the sexy lab technician.  Or 300% more zen, says the yoga teacher who's wearing all white.  Yeah, when I hear all those statistics, I'm just like, wow. 
[01:55:30]  These maxi pad wizards really get me.  Yeah, that's Stephen Lynch's friend in there, too.  Can't reel.  Hi.  Introducing Kotex Natural Balance.  Or Tyke, whatever his name is.  God, I wish I was bleeding right now.  Yeah, right?  Doesn't that make you just want to bleed?  Yeah, I like that it's marketed toward the edgy young girl, but no girls my age are wearing  maxi pads.  No.  Just with wings.  No.  Maxis?  You shove a tampon up there.  Yeah, no.  I think, you know, I don't blame Andrea, or I forget how you say her name, but she's a 
[01:56:00]  really funny improv chick, but I mean, whatever.  If you give me the right check, I would do that.  I would, too.  Yeah, give me 200 grand, and I'll just actually bleed in your commercial.  Literally, just stand there bleeding.  Yeah, just bleeding.  In the commercial.  Just like, hey, guys, guess what I'm up to?  Just dropping tons of blood.  You know, if you don't have insurance, you know, there's some funny stuff that can happen.  Yeah, I'm warming up.  But she's doing Sarah.  That's weird.  That is a Sarah impression. 
[01:56:30]  Can I hear her voice again?  Because I was too busy looking at the yoga girl, because I thought I knew her, which I  don't, of course.  There's a great line.  Newsflash.  Sometimes my period's not awesome.  But you know what helps?  Isn't it?  Those ads that are like 60 times smaller.  All right.  If I have to hear this one more time, I'm going to fucking.  Yeah, this is getting upset.  I film myself.  There we go.  You just wanted to see the yoga instructor again in her white leotard.  She is gorgeous.  I would love to wear that, show you what I look like in that white swimsuit.  I'd like to do the same thing. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  We're both wearers.  It would not look like that.  Come on.  It's like, do you have cellulite on your ankle?  I'm like, yeah.  I think I do.  Do you have cankles?  No.  I've got good legs.  I've got good legs going on.  My problem areas are elsewhere.  Problems?  What's a problem area?  Like the stuff that you're insecure about.  Oh.  Yeah.  The things that guys should really pick on.  Yeah.  The stuff that you guys, yeah.  In order to get you in bed.  What do you think is a problem area for you?  Um, for me, I would say like if I were wearing a bikini, like I feel good about myself, but 
[01:57:30]  I have like cellulite right on the top of my, like most girls, I think on the top of  my thighs in the back.  All right.  And that bugs woman, right?  Well, it's just, you know, sitting naked in a gravel truck.  It looks like I've been just soaking in a pot of cottage cheese.  Yeah.  No, it's not gross.  It's not like insane cellulite, but that's, you know, the flaw to focus on for me.  What about you, Jimmy?  Um, everything from the fucking pubis to the fucking forehead.  Oh yeah.  You like your legs.  Yeah.  I've, I've been, the leg compliments just go on for days. 
[01:58:00]  Oh yeah.  People just are upset.  It's fucking cabs McGillicuddy, whatever they say.  All the times I opened for you on the road, the number of people that asked if you were  a dancer was just unbelievable.  It was wonderful legs.  Look at those stems.  From the pubis.  Yeah.  You know, like from your pubis up.  Yeah.  My dick's fine.  It's just like, whatever it is, but it is, but my fucking legs are good.  I have a decent hiney.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's like on the, right at the waist is where I beat the fucking trouble, trouble  begins.  Yeah.  No, I feel, you know, like I can walk around confident in a bikini, but guys don't give 
[01:58:30]  a shit.  I think like no guys are looking, it's girls, other girls are, you stare at each other.  Like what's, where it is?  Where is it?  Oh, okay.  Good.  Yeah.  You really have to be a monstrosity for a guy to start like ragging about a bikini.  Yeah.  Guys get erections if a cat rubs against them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And on the beach, it's like, fuck man.  We're looking at girls pretty much in their bra and panties.  Yeah.  Totally.  No.  I can bring it.  I still feel good.  I can bring it.  Now, being an accomplished comedian, I really think that we should get somebody who looks 
[01:59:00]  up to Amy.  I think so too.  And we've been talking about comedy and wonderful Sarah Silverman impression from that.  And I should have known, like, when I brought up that topic of the commercials with the  comics, that you guys would know them and not really be able to shit on them.  Well, Eric Rivera, believe me, if I saw him, I'm going to do nothing but make fun of  all of them.  Yes.  Good.  Okay.  I hope you have insurance now.  He'll probably be like, ah, it was a paycheck.  You know, it's a gig.  I am being political about it for sure.  He's handsome though, and he smiles a lot.  So, I think people, uh, like, I just gave you the up and down. 
[01:59:30]  I wasn't even, I wasn't even fucking, you know what?  You're right.  You just stared at her crotch.  I wasn't even subtle about that.  You were, you were still saying hi to her while you were staring at her body.  I know.  Like, you were analyzing it.  Anthony actually said, va, va, voom.  Va, va, voom.  Oh, man.  23 skidoo.  Oh, jeez.  So, your name is Carly?  Yes, my name is Carly.  And you're friends with Troy?  Yes.  Are you dating Troy?  No.  He's very handsome.  Troy's very handsome, yes.  No, nothing.  Like, you've never even caught a finger from him? 
[02:00:00]  No.  Come on.  No.  It's okay.  I haven't.  All right.  If I was a chick, I'd probably bang Troy.  Which one's Troy?  Troy's the, uh, guy with the hip hair.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Troy could eat it.  Yeah.  So, how, how, uh, how do you know Troy?  Because Troy just said, hey, look, there's a friend of mine.  She's a big fan of Amy's.  Do you do stand-up?  Yes.  I like your outfit.  I like everything happening.  Thank you.  How long have you been doing it?  A few months.  Not very long.  Wow.  Oh, this is the time when you need exposure, Carly.  This is the time.  Get it out there. 
[02:00:30]  Get it out there.  This is the time.  You could be the star of a Kotex commercial in the near future.  That's my dream.  Now, what was the, uh, what was, Troy said that you were going to come in, and what was  the thrust of you coming in?  Because I love, I'm in love with Amy.  Thank you.  I want to be a lesbian with Amy.  I'm not a lesbian.  Wow.  I didn't walk in a lesbian, but.  You might with her?  I might with her.  That's really nice.  Yeah.  I'm open to experimenting.  Yeah, it's cool.  Yeah.  I'm not having very good luck dating, so.  Me neither.  Oh, no.  What happens with your dating? 
[02:01:00]  I hear that, girl.  Snaps.  What happened?  Well, how come dating isn't, uh...  I don't know.  I mean...  What?  I don't know.  There's a bunch of...  I feel like guys are just assholes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  They are.  I could attest to that.  By the way, this is the difference between the genders.  Can you imagine if a male comic came in and goes, I just want to suck Jim's dick?  Like, how uncomfortable that would be.  That is way different.  That is way different.  And how fast he'd get what he wanted.  Well, today's your lucky day, Bobby. 
[02:01:30]  Exactly, because Jim hates himself.  Okay, so, uh...  How old are you?  21.  Oh, yeah.  Very old.  Okay, yeah.  21.  That's the perfect time to start comedy.  That is a good time to start.  Yeah, you're allowed in bars.  Yeah.  That's good.  That's always a good first thing.  Yeah, you can vote.  That's good.  So, you got that going for you.  Uh-huh.  What is that?  You just turned 21, or...?  Yeah, I turned 21 in November.  Wow.  Yeah.  How many times have you done comedy?  How many times have I done it?  I do...  I've done a couple shows. 
[02:02:00]  But I do, like, open mics and stuff.  Like, the beginning stuff.  Yeah.  Cool.  Yeah.  You have to.  Bring her shows?  I don't like bring her shows.  No, they suck, but you have to do whatever for stage time.  Yeah.  You have to do whatever it takes, except for some things.  Well, no, that too, though.  Well, yeah, do that too.  If he's hot.  Whatever.  Who cares?  Just make sure you got that plan B.  I used to bark for those shows at the Boston, you know?  Oh, yeah.  They'd send me out in the freezing cold.  I'd be out there for two hours just to get five minutes of stage time. 
[02:02:30]  Holy shit.  And I'd go back and they'd be like, all right, and barking is, you know, standing on the street  saying, do you like live comedy and giving a flyer?  Do they have your name on the flyer so they know who got it?  No, no.  But, I mean, they wouldn't, you know, it was just lies.  I'm like, from Chappelle's show, it was just like three borderline homeless comics.  But then I would go back and they'd be like, there aren't enough people, you have to go out for another hour.  Or you could, you know, come and hang out with me for a while.  Oh, really?  And I'd be like, well, let me just zip up my coat and head back out to the streets. 
[02:03:00]  Sorry, Pauly confusion.  Mikey.  What did you want to do?  Did you want to just meet Amy or did you want to do your act for Amy?  Whatever you guys want me to do.  I'll do my act if you want.  I like her.  It would be nice to get a little, yeah, she's got a lot of confidence.  Yeah.  I hope that you are really funny and that you become, like, really great.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that would be good.  Good for the biz.  More girls should do stand-up.  Get better at it.  Yeah.  It's nice hair, too.  Gorgeous hair.  What's with the hair?  Thank you.  That's, yeah. 
[02:03:30]  It's very, very strawberry, almost, or red.  What would you say?  What color is that?  I don't know.  I think it's like a pinky red.  Pinky red.  I guess.  Yeah, yeah, like pink red.  I don't really know if it's...  Does the curtain match the...  Yes.  That's good.  Then guys won't know when you are bleeding.  Are you normally blonde, or...?  I have brown hair.  Oh, okay.  But I have to make it blonde and then put the red on it.  Is that your hair or a wig?  No, this is my hair.  Oh, okay. 
[02:04:00]  Wow, that's cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everything's good.  Everything looks good.  How did you get blonde under and red on top?  How the fuck did you swing that?  It's a separate thing.  You gotta make it separate.  Jimmy wants tips from Shameika's salon.  Yeah.  Is that a wee?  What's happening?  Okay.  Wow.  Okay, Carly, so do you want to, I guess, do a minute of your act?  Yeah.  We could do that.  You want to bring her up or something?  How do you...  Where's Kenny?  Intro?  Kenny should do that.  Kenny should do it.  Kenny's good at doing the intros for comics. 
[02:04:30]  By the way, this is the ideal circumstance to perform in, so there's no reason you shouldn't...  Oh, exactly.  No water.  She requested this.  Like, what's worse?  Okay.  She requested this.  You want to dim the lights a little bit, so it's not, like, this bright atmosphere, a  little...  Yeah, it's pitch black.  That's perfect for color.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like, you want to take your shirt off?  This feels like a bunch of purple in here.  It turned up a little bit.  I can't see her.  It's okay.  What the hell's going on?  What are we doing with our shoes on?  That's weird.  Yeah.  Right?  Good. 
[02:05:00]  Okay.  So, is that mic on over there?  Sam?  So, Kenny could do the...  I got that one on, so...  Kenny could...  Oh, God.  I'm sorry you had to meet Kenny.  That's...  Yeah, Kenny.  Just ignore me.  You'll have to deal with a bunch of lugs like him in various comedy venues.  You can't avoid it.  Yeah, so...  This is, you know...  This is what it's going to be like.  Yeah.  Get used to it, sister.  Yeah.  Get used to it.  I'll never be sister.  What credits do you want in your intro?  Oh, God.  Please don't go that close to her. 
[02:05:30]  I'm sorry.  Whatever you...  Just say whatever you want.  Say what...  Just do it.  Oh, make up some credits.  Say whatever you think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Now, let her rip.  Oh, my God.  Kenny.  You're ruining it.  Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Opie and Anthony channel, where right  now, we present the comedy stylings of Coralie.  Yay!  Wow.  What a great house MC.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Okay, so I recently stopped drinking because I do a lot of stupid shit when I'm drunk, 
[02:06:00]  and I used to mix drinks, which you're not supposed to do.  You know the saying, liquor before beer, you're in the clear.  Beer before liquor, I'm a lesbian.  And it's kind of true.  It's kind of true.  I'm not a lesbian yet.  Well, I wasn't when I walked in, but now things have changed.  Recently, I've been dating European guys, and people keep asking me why, and it's really  because they honestly just sound so much sexier when they tell me to go fuck myself. 
[02:06:30]  My friend told me the other day that she likes her coffee the way she likes her men, which  was confusing because I didn't know that coffee could go to jail for stabbing someone.  But I realized I actually do like my coffee the way I like my men because my coffee doesn't  have a job, and it doesn't answer my text messages.  I like it.  Come on. 
[02:07:00]  I like it.  I think, yeah.  I mean, six months?  Come on.  That's great.  When she said, I like my coffee, she likes her coffee like her men.  I thought you should have said raping her.  Jesus.  That's really nice.  Not you, but your friend.  It's about her friend.  Your friend.  Yeah, no.  He wants your friend to get raped, so it's okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's cool.  Yeah.  I think for six months, that's great.  What do you think?  Yeah, that's what I think.  I think, yeah, that's pretty good.  You got a little personality down there.  How did you downgrade from great to pretty good?  I don't know why you didn't do that.  Yeah, that's a big jump.  What's happening? 
[02:07:30]  Oh, oh.  You should have stayed with great, right?  Yeah, you should have stuck with great.  Yeah, no, it was great.  Oh, jeez.  No, no, uh.  Six months in, that's good.  No, no, that's really good.  Yes, I swear.  Thank you.  You know, great, really good.  What else could I say?  It was hard because the lesbian thing you said when you came in.  Yeah.  So you kind of blew that one.  You burned that one.  You already burned that material.  I blew it on my own.  I don't know how it is.  We all, yeah.  And it hurt my feelings because I thought it was like the first time you'd said it.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's just part of the act.  Yeah, just doing your material. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  You were the black guy in the audience or the Spanish guy in the audience.  You just happened to be there.  Yeah.  Right.  Just your stock, your stock material.  It's okay.  But you got a little, like a little personality character type thing that goes along with that  whole thing.  Is that, is that you?  Yeah.  Is that like really who you are?  You're kind of like, eh.  Yeah, I think this is her real vibe.  A little sheepish a little bit.  Maybe a little, yeah.  A little, yeah.  You should say like when the guy has, she's like, my friend likes her, man like her coffee. 
[02:08:30]  I'm like, yeah, what are you, stumbling guys or something?  So anyway, what else is going on?  My fucking God, man.  Let's see if you have what it takes to be a comedian though.  Do you have a good relationship with your father?  Yes.  Then, no.  Fuck.  I'm sorry.  Wrong job.  I'm sorry.  Wrong job.  It's not going to work?  Yeah, this market's not for you.  No.  What substance do you abuse?  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, what's your problem?  There are a lot of things that are wrong with me.  Like?  I mean, I don't, I don't drink a lot. 
[02:09:00]  I don't like really smoke weed, but I'm a little cuckoo.  Were you ever institutionalized?  I'm 100% cuckoo.  No, I was not.  Have you ever been into any sort of self-mutilation, like cutting?  No.  Not a car.  Damn.  She is nutty though, because she's, like, most people do in stand-up, if you say, well, you  want to do your act.  Oh my God.  And this book would go, no.  We'd just be like, no, it's too weird.  She's like, okay, do you want me to?  Yeah, she's like, whatever.  Yeah, you're too comfortable to do things.  That's the sign of a crazy person.  I don't drink all that much anymore.  Only when I have to drive three hours and take the money after pill. 
[02:09:30]  Are you promiscuous?  No.  Not really.  Oh, shut up.  How do you know Troy?  From a club?  No daddy issues.  Yeah, I know Troy.  We've been friends for a little while.  I don't even know what to say to her next.  I mean, yeah.  How are you a comic, though?  Because you seem pretty healthy.  What's wrong with you that makes you a comic?  Yeah.  I don't...  Social issues?  Anxiety?  Were you bullied a lot?  I'm very anxious all the time.  Oh, you get anxiety?  Very, very anxious.  That's good.  Okay. 
[02:10:00]  Take Xanax?  No.  Ah, shit.  Drug-free.  I don't do the substance thing.  Yeah, no, that's cool.  That's good.  That can come with time.  Yeah, that'll develop.  I'm afraid of everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm really afraid of everything.  Do a week in Cleveland in front of all the black crowds.  Trust me, you'll find a bottle.  Yeah.  But were they coming to see you?  Not on purpose, no.  No, it was just the club, the improv there.  They didn't tell me.  Oh, man.  I'm happy.  I love black crowds.  They're fun, but you want a heads up if that's what you're walking into. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, you gotta know.  I literally got there late, so I walked on stage.  That was my first time even in the club, and I was like, so who's...  Oh, everybody's black.  Okay.  Here we go.  But they were good crowds?  They were good, but you know, it's a totally different, I'm not going to say animal.  Totally different.  It's a different energy.  It's a different energy, for sure.  Were the comedians black on the show?  Yes, they were.  Yep.  Mm-hmm.  The improvs are black club included, right?  Yeah.  I text Tom Papa.  I'm like, everyone's black.  He goes, do you know white comics do hilarities?  I was like, no, nobody gave me the 411. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, well, you know what?  It's a great life if you like isolation and sleeping with strangers, so...  Have comedians been nice to you, or have they been kind of creepy and trying to bang  you?  They've been kind of creepy.  What have they promised you?  What have you been promised?  No, no.  Not anybody, like, good.  Like, there's comedians that are doing, like, open mics.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Don't really.  Wow.  There's not a lot they can offer up.  Yeah, they're not going to give you anything.  Do they want to get together and write or something? 
[02:11:30]  Like, yeah, we should meet, or do they just talk to you like a woman, or do they do some  comic shit?  I feel like sometimes guys feel like they have to be funny all the time.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Oh, I hate that.  I like being serious every so often.  And they know that you're a comic, they feel like they always have to say a joke.  Oh, I like that.  Yeah, that's not irritating at all.  Like Chip.  That's how Jimmy lives his life.  It's like I always say, Carly, you know, thank God that I laugh, but please don't let me  forget that I cried.  Oh, what a miserable person. 
[02:12:00]  Wow, is that horrible?  This is good training for you.  You'd have tweeted that if you were still drinking.  Oh, yeah.  I would have put three, what are the three dots in between?  Oh, right.  So you could, you know, get that three beats.  What's that amber sand, is that called?  I don't know.  Ellipses.  What's an amber sand?  The and sign.  Oh, I like that word.  Oh, there you go.  An amber sand?  Yes, as opposed to the alert, which we've all been the victim of.  Oh, my God.  Those cock blockers.  So you're afraid of everything.  You have a little fear thing going on, anxiety. 
[02:12:30]  Have you ever had, like, anxiety attacks?  Yeah, all the time.  Really?  About everything.  I'm really, I'm afraid of everything.  Like, like, what's, what's one of your biggest fears?  My biggest fear is probably something happening while I'm on the subway.  Yeah?  Like, that's a big one.  Like, an assault, like, uh.  She prez?  Like, it makes me nervous.  Like, if the train stops, me and Troy were just talking about it.  Like, if the train stops, I get, like, oh, my God.  Like, claustrophobic kind of things.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I'm just afraid of everyone and everything. 
[02:13:00]  Like, I'm just nervous.  Oh, you picked a good job.  Yeah.  When the train stops, I, my biggest fear is that we'll be stuck there and I'll be hungry.  I start looking around for people with food.  Like, what do I have to trade with them if we're down here for an hour?  Who do I have to kill first?  Yeah.  You start making total survival plans.  That child's an easy mark.  Right.  You're stuck for one minute.  You're like, I will eat your baby.  Get his gummy bears.  I could breastfeed from that woman.  So, you're afraid of, like, everything and people. 
[02:13:30]  Are you afraid of, like, because it's New York, are you afraid of crime?  Like, you're afraid of being assaulted?  I'm afraid I'm always going to get beat up.  Beat up?  I live in Queens and when I'm on the train, if there's, like, 13-year-old, like, Latina girls.  Oh, yeah, Latina girls.  Well, they're the most dangerous.  They're so scary.  They'll cut you.  They will cut you.  They won't hesitate to cut me.  Wow.  So, what do you do?  You try to lay low with that hair?  Yeah.  I just want to cut it off.  What's up with that hair?  Girl.  What you doing with that?  No, those teenagers are the scariest. 
[02:14:00]  One time they have my headphones on.  They don't see the consequences coming.  No.  They think they're invincible and they're trying to impress their friends.  I heard these people making a whole plan.  I don't think I'm invincible.  You can see me.  All right.  Don't be ignorant to me.  Yeah, ignorant.  You ignorant.  No.  Yeah.  You'll hear them plotting against you.  Oh, great.  I turn my headphones off.  They're like, we're going to steal her boots.  I'm like, I just want to start crying.  There's nothing I can do about it either.  They're 13.  I'm like, please don't hurt me.  Because you know that that's a no win because there's a pack mentality, but you're going to 
[02:14:30]  have to punch some of them in the face and it's hard to punch a 13.  It's not hard, but the consequences are bad for us.  I don't know.  I'll do it.  I'll punch a 13.  I would too.  I'll kick them right in the face.  I would like the opportunity.  They don't even have to do anything.  Yeah, I'd run so far away.  Hit the third rail.  Are you afraid of the third rail too?  Look out.  Everything.  Why stand up though?  Were you funny growing up?  I've always, I mean, I've always written jokes for like years, but I just never got out  and actually did it because it kind of takes a lot of balls to get up. 
[02:15:00]  It's like really, especially if you have anxiety.  Yeah.  Especially if you're afraid of everything.  It just takes a lot of work.  Yeah.  You have to hang out late at night with these kinds of guys.  With horrible people.  Yeah.  And then you lose your sense of self.  You can't have normal conversations with people who don't do stand up.  I find yourself so jaded that when regular people try to be funny, like, you know, I  have a trip.  Good fall.  And you're like, oh, just fucking get it.  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  You're confused.  You're like, I don't, when people try and joke around, I'm just like, oh, is that a joke?  Oh my God.  Oh, I get it.  A layman joke.  End it.  What about with sex?  Are you like, do you have weird sex like issues or are you like pretty comfortable sexually?  Pretty comfortable.  Nice.  Is there anything in there though, like choking or stuff like that?  Um, 21.  That's right when you start to experiment with, uh, yeah.  With like, it's not just laying there.  I'm Italian.  Okay.  Yeah.  I feel like, um, sex has changed now cause you can tell when guys watch too much porn. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  You know, like you'll get into it.  You're like, okay, why are my legs back here right now?  Why are you choking me?  Yeah.  Why are all your friends here?  Yeah.  See, yeah.  I never got the choking thing.  Jimmy's brought that up a few times and things that, yeah.  Yeah.  I enjoy a good strangulation.  It's just being totally dominated, you know?  Like somebody's being like, I'm in charge.  Oh, you mean sexually?  No.  Oh, I just mean on the balcony like Johnny Ola. 
[02:16:30]  Like Luca Brasi in the bar.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  No, yeah, that's just a little too weird dominating.  I think that's like...  For a second, I don't mean like an hour's sesh of...  Yeah, just fucking...  No blood to the head.  How long was I out for?  No.  Well, put it this way.  You're going to need another pill.  Yeah.  Just a little rough housing.  Wow.  I think there's other ways to dominate, though, that don't entail like... 
[02:17:00]  That's violence.  Just show your tax return.  That's it.  Yeah.  Ah!  Life dominates you.  How are you doing in life?  I'm like, let me punch up my Bank of America account here.  How do you get a load of this?  I don't even know who's boss.  Yeah.  I don't know about that.  No?  You know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think I'm pretty traditional.  You're pretty vanilla in the sack?  Well, not just vanilla.  Yeah.  No.  Well, vanilla as far as my partner goes.  Of course.  Your preferences.  Let's be honest. 
[02:17:30]  I certainly don't delve into any exotic flavors.  Yes.  What's that?  No moose tracks.  No moose tracks.  No moose tracks.  That's amazing.  That's amazing.  No, the choking.  Anything choking, slapping.  But spanking.  No.  Very playful.  That's one thing.  Of course.  And not dooring.  Not dooring.  Really?  That's kind of silly.  You spank after?  I'll grab.  Yeah, yeah.  A little spank after.  Look what you did.  That's a poo-poo.  Get your ass out.  Yeah.  Get out of here.  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  That's how you guide them to the door.  Yeah.  A little tap on the ass.  Spanking.  No.  You don't spank them and then like squeeze their pussy a little bit and scold them for craving.  Blackhawk.  What's wrong with you?  Who are you?  Are you not an American?  That's fine.  What'd you vote for?  Fucking Putin?  No.  It's not.  No, no.  It doesn't necessarily mean it's just, you know, all vanilla fucking missionary position  and shit.  Yeah.  But hair pulling seems silly unless you're like, you got the hand on the back of her head 
[02:18:30]  and you kind of grab a handful of hair naturally.  Right.  To just sit there and yank on her fucking hair.  No, that's insane.  That's insane.  That's a crazy person.  It doesn't.  Meh.  Meh.  I'm going to pull you a hair.  You're like, you're doing it wrong.  I yank her hair like that Jimmy Cagney clip.  Did you see that clip recently?  Where he fucking, the best breakup clip ever where he throws the chick out of his house  and he drags her by the hair across the floor.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We did watch that one.  That is a good one.  Phenomenal.  Yeah, that's how it should be done.  It's the best clip ever.  Sounds like a good guy.  I don't know. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, he's a great guy.  I think done right, it's good.  Because it's sort of, it's fun.  It's like, that feeling of, it's almost like guiltless sex.  Like, well, I don't even have a choice in the matter.  This is just what's happening.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, not my fault.  Being forced.  Not my fault I'm getting fucked.  You'd be terrible to cheat with.  Oh, God.  One strand.  One fucking strand ends up somewhere.  Yeah.  And it's done.  There's no question.  Game fucking over.  There's no way you can, you know.  Can't call it that.  Oh, no.  One of those.  The maid brought her kid here, and she had a fucking raggedy and doll. 
[02:19:30]  The Muppets did a show.  Oh, God.  Are you on Twitter?  Bye.  Oh, you're on the Twitter.  Yes.  What's your Twitter name?  How many followers you got?  A thousand and something.  Whoa.  Nice.  Look at you.  How many you want?  Watch this.  Watch the power of the opening Anthony show.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's going to be like three.  Three or more.  Five unfollows. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  Fucking ones you'll have to get restraining orders against.  Relatives.  Stop talking to you.  Yeah.  Shunned by the community.  You don't want any of these people.  They're despicable.  You know you're a piece of shit when you can't even open your camera photos without shielding  it so nobody sees it.  Oh, God.  Jimmy.  You are.  I thought you were a piece of shit long before that.  I know that, but it's awkward when you're at the cellar and you realize that you want  to just Twitter a photo of you and Tom Hanks, but you don't know who's behind you, and God  forbid your thing opens. 
[02:20:30]  All right.  What's a greater fear than when you hand somebody your phone to look at a photo and they make  them move like they're scrolling?  Oh, God.  Yeah, let me look through your pictures.  Don't look through my fucking pictures.  Knock yourself out.  God damn.  Do you have nude photos of yourself on your phone?  No.  Well, do you have anything to be ashamed of then?  Yeah, but I don't like people touching my phone, like my text messages.  Like, it's just, I don't.  Are you a dirty texter?  No.  Oh, so they're not going to find it.  You've never sexted?  I hear it's a problem with the kids. 
[02:21:00]  I don't get the point of it.  Yeah?  Sexting?  Yeah.  It can be really fun if you're alone in a hotel room for enough time.  Yeah.  It's all necessity.  Yeah.  I write really sexy shit, like, I'm going to come up your crack, LOL.  Oh, so cute.  LOL.  LOL is the hottest part about it.  Yeah, the LOL.  I had the worst sexting experience with a guy lately.  I was, I had plans.  I was going to have sex with this guy. 
[02:21:30]  Like, it was going in that direction, okay?  Another guy misses out.  But that's how bad the phone sex went.  Oh, no.  Yes.  Wow.  Okay, so I wrote something to him, like, something like, I'm going to sit on your face, or just  something, you know, something really beautiful, like poetry.  Of course.  I was writing Shakespeare.  So then, and like, something about, I don't know, I don't remember, but it was something  like pulling his hair or something, I don't know.  And then, uh, the guy wrote back, um, yeah, like, I'm going to go down on you, like, it's  my job.  But, but like, but Oral has to go both ways. 
[02:22:00]  And, and I was like, whoa, wait, he said, I'm going to go down on you.  Like, it's my job.  Like, it's my job.  That's a horror.  First of all, it was bad.  That's terrible.  It was so bad.  And I go, and then I go, this isn't a negotiate.  Like, I feel like I was on a used car lot.  And he was like, well, I'll throw in the free air conditioning, but, and I was just  like, you know what?  This is, he goes, do you want to try again?  I was like, no.  Oral goes both ways.  Who would say that when it beats both ways? 
[02:22:30]  My client would like to receive some more.  Yes, he's in the friend zone.  Yeah.  That was it.  That's Oral goes both ways.  Oral's going to go both ways.  It's not like you're even in the room trying to avoid some cock sucking.  It was the worst.  I was just like, ugh.  That's fucking awful.  I don't think I even masturbated for like a week after that.  Wow.  That guy's like, no thanks.  That guy fucked up.  He does, and he knew, he knew it.  The next day, he's like, yeah, that, we really blew it.  I go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[02:23:00]  We?  You blew it.  Yeah.  Let's call a spade a spade here.  It's like the Kobayashi Maru.  There's nothing worse than a terrible dirty texture.  I can be nonstop.  Like, I'm an addict, so I can see somebody going, just pretend they don't see it.  Yeah, just like, all right.  Ryan already would get it.  Do you want to smell my ass?  I fucking heard you.  Dear mom.  That's amazing.  But it's the fucking ones that are just duds and don't know how to write.  It's like, you fucking, you're horrible. 
[02:23:30]  That sucks.  Yeah.  I won't even send you, I hate when people that won't send you a dirty, like, any type of photo.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  Have fun.  Live your life.  Yes.  God, there are, I have to really have a good relationship with every ex or, like, God knows the shit storm that would hit the internet.  I fucking was talking to this one girl and she was just really pretty and I liked her, but she was such a fucking dud.  I didn't even try to talk dirty to her.  I mentioned something about sex, like, something sexually, but I wasn't, and she's like, talking about, what did she say? 
[02:24:00]  Uh-oh.  Talking about sex, I'm going to take a big pass.  Ew.  And I said, I feel like I'm talking to my grandmother.  Yeah.  And I never spoke to her again.  I'm going to take a big pass.  Yeah, just like, no.  No wonder you're single.  Right.  Stupid.  That's why you're 30 and single, you unsexy dud.  That's awful.  That, because her boyfriend had cheated on her.  Uh-oh.  That's why he fucked somebody else, idiot.  Yeah.  Because you're a dud.  You're a fucking dud.  Was that in a text?  You're a fucking dud.  Yeah.  I'm going to take a big, I would say that. 
[02:24:30]  Dude, I wasn't even being dirty.  Right.  It was literally, she was so, she was such a fucking lump.  That's so funny.  I love how Jimmy gets so like, he's so bad, he's physically pissed off.  But I so understood why her boyfriend cheated on her.  I'm like, that's why he fucked somebody else.  Like, I don't cheat, but I'm like a monogamous whore.  Like, if a guy cheated on me, it would be to have just normal sex with somebody.  He'd like find some nice girl where it would just be normal vanilla sex. 
[02:25:00]  A little too outrageous.  I met her at church, and I took her home.  Yeah, I find myself just being...  A Christian mingle.  Yeah.  A Christian mingle.  There must just be some horrendously, like, crazy sex going on on that, though.  Yeah.  Repressed fucking...  Oh, that's the creepiest.  Whenever I see that commercial.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let Jesus match you up.  The guy from religious backgrounds, they are the wildest in bed, I find.  Girls, too.  Yeah, totally.  I found that they're really fucking crazy.  Yeah.  I don't know why that is.  Something about Catholic school, they just... 
[02:25:30]  I don't know.  They're just like, fuck you, mom.  Bunch of sisters.  They're not nuns.  They were literally sisters years ago.  Black and sisters.  Huge Catholic upbringing was crazy.  Yeah.  The parents had to know everything they were doing, and they were insane.  Yeah.  Insanely wild.  Could not get out of the house and get into anywhere to have sex faster.  They just loved having sex.  Just wanted something.  Just, yeah. 
[02:26:00]  Get away from that whole Jesus thing.  A lot of leaky submarine going on.  Yeah.  Religious, are you?  No.  No?  Not really.  What are you supposed to be?  I'm Catholic.  Yeah, Italian.  That kind of goes with it, I guess.  I don't go to church and stuff, but...  No?  I'm not super religious.  I mean, I believe in God, but I'm not...  Yeah.  You've got to believe in God because you're afraid.  You need some kind of hope.  Yeah, exactly.  I can't think it all just ends.  God's not going to help you on the subway when you get raped.  That's true.  That's true.  Repeatedly by 13-year-old Latin girls. 
[02:26:30]  13-year-old.  We learned, yeah.  So sorry about Tina chicks.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I'm annoyed at that guy.  What guy?  The fucking...  Oh, I know.  The guy...  The girls are too lazy?  It's going to go both ways.  It's going to go both ways.  It's going to go both ways.  Why would you say that?  I just was like, nope.  I go, you're ruining this.  You know you're ruining this.  Did you say that?  Yeah.  Good for you.  I can show you the conversation, but I didn't want you to see the name.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, Amy. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, Lenny Marcus.  I'm kidding.  I'm totally kidding.  Oh, no.  Lenny's a great guy.  He'd be an awful dirty text.  Oh, can you imagine trying to dirty text with Lenny?  Oh, that'd be amazing.  I kind of want to do that.  You write something like, I want to suck your cock, and for an hour, he'd write back,  you're crazy.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's like, I'm uploading software on my computer right now.  Oh.  You have to know iPad, and we just ignore it, pretend you didn't see it.  Oh, no.  So change the name.  Put a different name.  I don't care who it is.  Okay.  All right.  I'll show it to you.  You ever use the same fucking scenarios in your sexting and hope that they never talk 
[02:27:30]  to each other about it?  Like, two people out randomly.  Yes.  It's like, this is a good one.  This is a proven scenario I have here.  I actually have it in my notepad.  I could just copy and paste.  Copy, paste, sexting.  Yeah, that's a good one.  All right, I'll throw the hands against the wall thing.  Yeah.  No, it's got to be genuine.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the same thing if somebody's like, kind of like, oh, I guess I'll try to spank you.  You feel it.  You're like, oh, come on, you pack.  I'll try to spank you. 
[02:28:00]  You're trying, all right.  Do it or don't.  You're failing.  No, I personalize it.  I'll write things from today's paper.  I'll be like, I'm going to push your face into the March Madness bracket signs.  Suck my cock where the poo comes out.  Well, I know we wrote it today.  Look, it's today's headlines.  Suck my caucus.  Political humor.  Political humor.  Too political.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that way they know it's that day.  Do you have a boyfriend?  No.  Aw.  She said she has relationship troubles. 
[02:28:30]  Wow, which one with you in relationship?  You're afraid of guys, too?  Are you afraid of everything?  They pull their penis out.  She's like, ah!  What is that?  You're like a chihuahua in a thunderstorm.  She screams like Fay Ray.  Ah, run into the bathtub.  Good reference.  The worst.  Really the worst.  Really?  Are you a bad girlfriend?  I'm a good girlfriend when I have a boyfriend, but I just never have a boyfriend.  Oh, man.  Are you prudish?  No, I just...  I...  It's got to be an issue.  I don't... 
[02:29:00]  I mean, I have a hard time, like, actually not getting sick of someone within, like, a week.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  That's kind of my thing.  How do you refer to his penis?  Like, what word will you use?  Um, I guess his penis.  I don't know.  What do you mean?  That filthy thing.  He wants you to say cock.  Slowly.  No, no, no.  It's regular.  Like, that says a lot.  Some people won't talk like that.  Yeah.  They just won't.  Like, at all.  When a girl's like, I want to... 
[02:29:30]  And she won't say it.  Like, you want to what?  I want to get in.  You're a member.  You're a member.  You're a member.  You're a member to join my club.  Call it a pud or don't call it nothing at all.  A pud.  Yeah.  The old AIDS dispenser.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You want the life changer?  Get on.  Put the life changer in your mouth.  That was horrible.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  The life changer.  Yeah.  When was the last time you had a boyfriend? 
[02:30:00]  Oh.  Jimmy.  Jimmy, you're not a queen.  About a year ago.  I almost got him that time.  About a year ago.  A year ago.  Like, I date people, but I haven't been in a relationship in a year.  Yeah.  And what did he do?  I just got over it.  Like, I was over it.  We dated for a while.  You didn't want to have sex in the minute.  I mean, like, did he do anything?  Was he a student or did he have a job?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was a student.  A student.  Oh, yuck.  Have you been in love yet?  Like, fuck in love.  Oh, man.  Or you just want to be having sex with a person all the time. 
[02:30:30]  It's all you can think about.  Oh.  So you're missing out on a heartbreak.  Yeah.  Your comedy is going to change once you start really living life and getting disappointed.  Yeah.  A guy never really made you feel like, wow.  I don't mean sexually.  At first, yeah.  I mean, the beginning of the relationship is always exciting, but then after that, I just  get bored.  Did you have your heart broken at a young age?  Like a young crush?  You were 14 and some guy, you found out he was fucking all your friends? 
[02:31:00]  No.  Oh, wait.  Wait.  Who are we?  Sorry.  Well, sorry.  I don't know what just happened there.  I don't know what just happened.  Then you got busted for selling Coke and you went and visited him in Fishkill, New York  while he served time.  Wait.  Who is saying this?  Who's saying this?  How old would the guy have been?  What?  How old would the guy have been?  You may have been 14.  I'm not.  Why do you guys just assume I'm talking about me?  No, I'm not.  I'm just saying.  I got the plan B for my friend yesterday.  Right.  For my friend.  Wait.  What was the question?  How old was the guy? 
[02:31:30]  It was when I was 14.  What was he?  14.  Oh, I'm thinking he went to regular jail.  Oh, he just went to a juvenile.  No, no.  He didn't get arrested until he was 19 for selling Coke.  Oh, boy.  You were still with him?  No, no.  14.  But we were just still in touch.  Yeah.  A little 14-year-old Amy, all wild.  Yeah.  Not really.  I was not a Catholic school girl, but I was friends with all those chicks, and they blew  my mind.  They would just be like, I just blew him behind that dumpster.  I'd be like, what? 
[02:32:00]  What?  I'm still teething.  Jesus Christ.  I was a late bloomer, but then, you know, once it happened, it happened.  Then you got to make up for lost time, as they say.  I was like, well, what time is it?  I have a lot of catching up to do.  I catch this freshman 15 in my own way.  Well, don't forget, oral is two-way street.  Two-way street.  That's exactly how I read it.  It's going to go both ways.  Yeah.  Well, let's get this straight, Missy.  Both ways.  I'll do you if you do me.  Yeah.  What a mistake.  Quid pro quo on the oral. 
[02:32:30]  Quid pro oral.  But especially since the thing is, you don't say that.  You can think it and go like, all right, but when it's happening.  But when you're talking dirty, you don't have to be so literal.  It was an immediate negotiation.  I mean, when you're going down on a girl, you're hoping that it will be reciprocal.  Oh, I'll say it.  Like, if she's like, I'm about to come, I'll be like, well, that's to be determined.  Yes.  Well, let's discuss.  You're either going to come really good or your clit's going to get pinched between  my fingernails. 
[02:33:00]  I'm going to flick your clit like it's a fucking marble.  So where do you go on dates with guys?  I can't let you see.  Where do you go on dates?  I'm going to change it, but Danny's like, I wouldn't even know.  Oh, that's hilarious.  You would know.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  He's a famous comic.  Oh, yeah.  He's really famous.  It's to Rosa.  She goes, ugh.  But the text will give me away.  She goes, ugh.  If she says, I want to rub my pussy on your shoulders, we'll know who it is.  Poor Joe. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  He just got an ugh.  Do a good slave.  I'll know who it is by the context.  I'll know who it is by the, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not doing it.  No, I'm kidding.  I won't.  I won't.  Oh, man.  No, I was going to make a Bob Kelly joke.  Oh, dude.  If he says something like, boom, you lay back, you get your pussy, you get your dick  on the floor.  Boom, you come on my fingers.  You get coffee.  You'll pet my dogs.  Not changing.  Yeah, I won't always my contact.  I don't know how these guys talk dirty.  Oh, God.  Get a oral ghost both ways.  If there's a lot of misspellings, I'll know. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, man.  People are just terrible at it, though.  People are fucking terrible at it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really bad.  You got to have some panache.  When people take it too literally, it's like, we're playing.  It doesn't mean anything.  Right.  It's silly banter.  It's fun flirt.  It doesn't mean we're actually going to do all this stuff.  A big no.  Sometimes you...  Oh, I'll take a big pass.  A big pass.  That's it.  You want to take a big rope and hang yourself on a big bridge.  That's why you're a big age and you got no big significant other. 
[02:34:30]  You fucking big zero.  Keep playing with your dopey pussy.  You got lonely.  Keep fucking dry humping your clit, you fucking zilch.  Hope a fucking dog steps on your twat.  She made me fucking sick.  Oh, God damn.  You unsexy lump.  Oh, that is just horrible. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, I was talking about sick.  I'll take a big pass.  Oh, I made me...  It bothered me.  It made me so fucking angry.  Because it was such a fucking...  First of all, her age annoyed me.  Right.  30 and single.  And you better be fucking nicer.  Yeah, something better go on, right.  You better be fucking nicer.  I don't talk to chicks that age anymore.  I really don't.  I tried a few.  Yeah, they get a little fucking...  You're different, though, Amy.  You're fucking...  You're not a civilian.  Nah, and you're an exception, I think. 
[02:35:30]  You're different.  Yeah, she...  But I'm talking about...  She fucks around.  The women I've spoken to who are that age, as far as being like, you know, well, could  we do it this night?  It's like, no.  Go fuck yourself.  I'll never speak to you again.  You're fucking 30 and you got nobody and you wonder what...  That's why.  I'm amazed you got to the point where you were actually texting.  That entails like exchanging a number and stuff like that to where you didn't know her  enough to know that she would say like a big pass on sex. 
[02:36:00]  She was fun to talk to in person.  Yeah.  But just a dud on like, you know, a couple times, like, hey, you want to meet up and have  lunch?  No.  Okay.  Goodbye.  You know, go fuck yourself.  Exactly.  You know what you do for a living.  You're just doing right now.  So dating, um, you, uh, no, Jimmy.  So dating, uh, how do those go?  What do you, where do you go?  Where do they take you?  Oh, Jimmy.  Never anywhere good.  Never anywhere good.  Where? 
[02:36:30]  It's like, whatever, something, like if you're just meeting up for drinks, just any kind of  You need a, you need a sugar daddy.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh my God.  I'm looking.  Come on, Amy.  I changed the contact now.  I don't see the, um, oh wait.  Okay.  I got it.  Uh oh.  Oh boy.  Look, she's, she's smiling over here like, uh.  She's nervous that you're going to know who he is.  Yeah.  I really don't want you to know who he is.  I will have.  Yeah, he's cut it out.  I won't know. 
[02:37:00]  You will know.  I will not.  Is he white?  Okay.  Um, yeah.  That's what you're talking about.  Exactly.  Um.  That's what I like about Amy the most.  Okay.  All right.  She's scrolling.  I'm, I'm just trying to, to delete anything that would let Jimmy know who it was.  Oh.  No, just read it to me.  Just don't delete it.  Just read it around.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  All right.  Here it is.  All right.  This was the, wait.  Uh, I don't, I'm not going to read exactly what I wrote.  Cause, um, I'm a lady. 
[02:37:30]  All right.  Okay.  Um, okay.  I said something about straddling his face.  Cause I'm, I'm a sweet lady.  Yeah, you do that.  And, uh, he goes, no, uh, no hair pulling, but I'm going to go down on you like it's my  job.  Wait a minute.  You said you'd pull his hair?  Yeah.  I was like, I'm going to pull his hair.  And he corrected you?  Yeah.  No hair pulling, but I'm going to go down on you like it's my job.  My troop might come off.  That's sexy.  I go, I go, I'm not hard.  I just, I go nothing weird.  I go, this is my fantasy.  What, what, it's not about you.  I, um, I, and I said something about wanting to treat him like my toy. 
[02:38:00]  And then he said, um, sounds okay, but it's, it's about me too.  So the oral is going to go both ways.  Holy fuck.  This guy is terrible.  Guys.  I said, you ruined it.  He said, ha ha.  Ha ha.  Yeah.  Now he's trying to get away with an LOL.  I go, that was fun.  Um, I go, it just became a negotiation.  He said, he said, yeah, not even a good one.  Like a shitty dealership negotiation.  Should we try again?  I went, forget it.  Oh, shit. 
[02:38:30]  And that was it.  That was it.  Oh man.  Face.  That was it.  Amy does not play fucking games.  No.  That's it.  I'm not going to, that's it.  That was like two texts, two texts separated from, I want to straddle your face.  And he fucks that up.  Yeah.  That's it.  What a fucking.  And she was going to have sex with him.  That's what I was saying.  That's, that's it.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  When you mess with William Stevenson, yeah, that's what you're going to get.  The oral goes, no hair pulling. 
[02:39:00]  Oh.  You don't correct somebody.  And half the shit that I text, I don't even mean.  I just feel like it.  I'm not going to.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, it's like, it's just fucking a game.  Yeah.  People, there's a way to say, if someone asks you directly, do you like something, you can  go, no, I'd try it though.  And then in the moment or in an unsexual moment, you talk about it, like when you're in the  car or something.  And then you let the person know that that's not my thing.  But if it's just texting, like you're just texting, it's just fun, you're flirting.  Believe me, I've never gone down on anyone for hours. 
[02:39:30]  All right?  Okay.  Right.  So.  Oh, yeah.  I've never even written that.  No.  Well, I wouldn't put it in context.  Do you think I've really fucked the shit out of anybody?  That's really funny.  The shit will actually.  Yeah.  I've never, I've never actually throat punched somebody and came on their children.  Oh, my God. 
[02:40:00]  That's amazing.  Well, kids are fast.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get away.  That's how it goes.  Oh, man.  Is that, is that the, is that the, not the worst?  That annoys me.  That's how.  Most annoying.  But yeah.  It's infuriating.  Both of yours are terrible.  Yeah.  That guy should hook up with fucking a big pass bitch.  Oh, that one, that one gets me more.  That she sucks.  I'll take a big pass.  I should have, I deleted it.  Shut up.  I took her number out of my phone because she was really pretty.  I didn't want to be tempted to text her again because she was such a dud. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  But I was nasty to her too.  I was annoyed.  Yeah.  Wait, he wrote, okay.  I go, I can't believe how much texting just backfired.  That was really the worst.  And he wrote.  Good for you.  Fuck.  He wrote, agreed.  He wrote, agreed.  Didn't go the way either one of us thought it was going to go.  No.  I said, um, no.  The blame is on you.  Yeah.  He's trying to fucking.  I said, I wrote, own it, learn from it.  And then I wrote, friends forever.  And then he said, good point.  I accept me being awful at texting.  I really did botch it.  That was it.  All right. 
[02:41:00]  I forget the fact that he said botch it means he must be a great comic.  You just share the blame at first.  Yeah.  Both, you know, like oral.  Yeah.  It goes both ways.  I was like, no.  I was like, own it.  Learn from it.  Yeah.  You got to.  Friends for life.  There's a way to sneak things in there.  Because you don't want to come out and go, do you like this?  Because it's just, I like things to kind of feel organic.  But, you know, sometimes you take too big a risk.  There's a way to let somebody off the hook if they go down a way that, a road you don't  want to go down.  Or you just play with the texting.  Anything goes. 
[02:41:30]  Anything goes when you're texting.  I'm not.  Yeah.  If you actually go from texting to in bed, I think some concessions can be made as to  what you, you know, well, that's a verbal contract in the text.  I will now read from paragraph three, section two.  You did say you would lick my asshole.  Now you're denying that?  I'll write something, I'll write something really sexy, like, I'm going to put you on  your stomach and fill your buns. 
[02:42:00]  How are you single?  I know.  What a catch.  Chivalry.  I'm going to put my hard hot dog in between your buns.  Oh, my God.  You're honestly going to leave here a lesbian.  I'm going to pound you, and then I'll say I'm going to pound you slow, then fast, then  slow, then fast.  And I'll write it like 30 times.  Keep going.  And slow, then fast.  And I'm going to tease you with my fucking helmet.  I'll say fucking helmet.  Fucking helmet.  Oh, these poor women.  Yeah. 
[02:42:30]  And men.  Yeah.  I'll say dear androgynous.  You know what women like, too?  When you tell them, I'll fucking, my tongue is going to be all chafed and shit like a cat  tongue after I'm done, after I'm done licking down there.  Oh, my God.  I want, like, the first text to be, like, right when she goes, so what would you do?  Like, like, we're just us getting into it?  Like, we're just us getting into it.  I would dry dick you in the ass hard and deep. 
[02:43:00]  The first fucking one.  Right out the gate.  Right out the gate.  See how far that goes.  Or just fire out.  A dry dick you.  Any girl that doesn't just block you is a keeper.  Come on.  Definitely.  Or you just, you fire out random what ifs.  Like, not that I'm into this, but do you mind if a guy shits in your mouth?  If a guy shit in your mouth, would you swallow it, spit it out, or just comment on the girth? 
[02:43:30]  Oh, my God.  God damn.  See, but that would be at least funny.  Yes.  She goes, what are you doing?  Right into, I'm going to dry dick you.  Your ass.  Hard and deep in the ass.  Oh, my God.  And then, and then, like, dot, dot, dot, blood?  Question mark.  Question mark.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  See, that's fun sexting.  That's exciting.  A better way to address Amy's thing about sitting on the face would have been to say, well, tit for tat. 
[02:44:00]  Jesus.  That would have been better.  God.  I mean, I was angered.  I wouldn't be sad.  There's no reason for that.  And then when he tried to share the guilt.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, motherfucker.  He can't even fucking own up to the fact that he screwed the pooch on that one.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I guess we'll take a break.  Yes.  Right?  It's 10 after.  And then, is Will Ferrell coming?  Will Ferrell.  Yes, he is.  That's cool.  Whisper his name.  Ooh. 
[02:44:30]  And Carly, thank you, by the way.  Carly, you're going to make it in this business.  Yeah, the fact that you're the ball to the material was good.  You're welcome to sit and hang out with me.  Yeah, you can hang out and watch Will Ferrell.  If you like Will Ferrell.  You know.  Everybody loves him, right?  Okay.  Yeah.  Right.  What's your name on Twitter?  So people can follow you.  Oh, yeah.  I was going to Twitter.  My Twitter is Twit4Tat.  Twit4Tat is C-W-I-T-4-F-O-R-T-A-T-T.  There's two T's at the end.  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  I just fell asleep in the middle of that.  I know, right? 
[02:45:00]  I know.  It's so annoying.  Use your name.  You got any tats?  Yeah.  My whole...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Let me see.  Well, let me see.  The ones on your own.  I got...  I mean, I'm wearing...  I thought you were afraid of everything.  I'm not afraid of...  She's so...  Like, you're so pretty.  I like a second a girl has tattoos.  You don't have any issues.  Everyone's interested in it.  Yeah, now it's like, oh, wait a minute.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, wow.  It's really beautiful.  I have a bunch.  Holy fuck, man.  I can't really...  Oh, my God.  I can't believe you have a good relationship with your dad.  I know.  That doesn't...  They're gorgeous, but...  I don't look like it.  Doesn't figure.  You look like Hot Girl Interrupted. 
[02:45:30]  Twit4Tat.  I just, like, feel like there's something you're not telling us.  Right.  Like, you're a burn victim, but just over your ass or something.  Yeah.  Well, I was born with no vagina.  Yeah.  She's got no holes.  Is that it?  F-O-R.  Not the number.  I like your boots.  Thank you.  Everything's going good for you.  I didn't get down to the boots.  I stopped the badge.  Have you had sex with a comic yet?  No.  Just don't.  I mean, for reals.  Listen to me.  Hold on.  For reals.  Or at least don't dirty text with a comic. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, apparently they stink.  No, don't with an unestablished comic.  Ah.  No, it's Carly C-A-R-L-Y?  Yes.  Okay.  This guy isn't...  He's, like, one of the hottest comics Hoboken has to offer right now.  I don't know what you're...  Hoboken circuit.  This guy is making moves.  He's killing.  Yeah.  Those tattoos are gorgeous.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's really good work.  It's like...  Do you go to the same artist?  No prison tats.  I went to a couple people.  No.  Blood drop tats.  Where do you have them all now? 
[02:46:30]  That arm?  I have this arm.  I have one on my ribs, one on my hip, and one, like, right, like, above.  Holy shit.  That's the benefit of, like, being, like, flawless physically.  You can get them on your ribs.  If I went in there, they'd be like, where are your ribs?  Please.  I'm like, I think they're supposed to be under here somewhere.  He's got to take an x-ray before he tats you.  Oh, here they are.  They line up.  Jeez.  Somewhere.  Wow, that's pretty good.  Yeah, I thought, kind of, timid girl, you wouldn't have tats, or you'd be afraid of the needle 
[02:47:00]  or something.  No, actually, I'm not afraid of that.  You like the pain?  Yeah, I like it.  Yeah?  That's right.  I got a vibe, like, you would have been into self-mutilating at some point.  Nothing?  Yeah.  No, the tattoo's a little bit.  That's not mutilation, but that's a little bit of...  Like, you have, like, more than three tattoos.  Like, there's something, like, mentally actually wrong with everybody.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, science.  There's something mentally wrong with everybody.  Yeah.  What is normal?  Right?  Jimmy, right?  Jimmy poses a great question.  You don't have those big, uh... 
[02:47:30]  I say that a lot of times during text, but that's not normal.  Calamari earrings, do you?  I'm uncomfortable.  I don't have those.  What's calamari earrings?  Those big rings that go in there and hold the fucking thing open like a U-Bangie?  Doesn't Troy have, like, some crazy shit going on?  Oh, if it's hip, he's got it.  He's got it.  Oh, boy, look out.  That guy's on the cutting edge.  Why do you hang out with Troy if you're not having sex?  Yeah, what do you guys do?  Talk?  We're friendly.  He's nice.  He wants it.  He's a nice guy.  Oh, he'd love to have banged you.  Yeah.  Trust me.  He has plans for you.  He got you on the show. 
[02:48:00]  He's like, well, now what?  Yeah.  Now what's up?  How'd you fall into the friends?  It's too much street.  What happened when he made the move?  Because he made the move.  He never made the move.  What?  We're just close friends.  Like, we're friends.  We talk all the time.  He actually, the most interesting text message I ever got from him was a couple weeks ago  when he asked me if I had any friends that would shit on a table for this show.  Oh, well, we were asking.  Are we going to take a quick break?  We were asking for girls to shit on a table, so hopefully you do.  All right.  We'll be breaking back with Will.  Good luck, Carly.  Nice meeting you. 
[02:48:30]  I'm back with Will Farrell.  Ooh.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the Opinion of Today Show.  Are we back?  Oh, good.  We're black.  Hi.  And Will Farrell.  Will Farrell, yes.  Will be coming in the studio.  He's actually coming in the studio as we speak.  No way.  There he is.  Hi, sir.  All right.  Grab yourself a seat.  Yes. 
[02:49:00]  The wonderful Jimmy Norton.  Good to see, man.  Good to see.  The lovely Amy Schumer.  Hi.  Nice to meet you.  How's it going?  The worthless Sam Roberts.  Totally worthless.  I'm Anthony, and you're Will Farrell, and that's Carly on the couch.  She was just showing us.  She's been doing stand-up for like six months, and she did a little of her act for us.  Yes.  Right in that corner.  She lives over there.  We wanted to feel how it is to be a comic in the early...  That's a tough...  It is.  It's a tough room.  I mean, literally a tough room.  It really is.  A tough corner in a tough room. 
[02:49:30]  A tough corner.  Yeah.  And she did material.  She stood up and did material, which is pretty ballsy, because I wouldn't be able to do that.  No.  Yeah.  She's obviously a sociopath.  Is that your real hair?  Yes.  Okay.  No follow-up questions.  I just want to know.  Do you want to stand up?  I did.  I did.  I did it very painfully.  You started doing it, or after you got finished?  No.  I did it for...  I did it poorly for like a year, and maybe got 15 minutes of material. 
[02:50:00]  Right.  That's a lot for a year.  You ever sexed with Amy?  Oh, God.  I thought maybe it was him.  Yeah.  Okay.  A tough crowd.  She won't tell us.  A tough crowd.  Yeah.  Oh, she won't?  Yeah.  Imagine when he left, I'm like, it was Will.  It was Will.  Yeah, it was Will.  Yeah.  I had some excellent Star Trek material.  Oh, nice.  So did I for years.  My opening joke was an awful Star Trek alien joke.  No, what was it?  What was it?  Come on.  Oh, that's bad.  It was humiliating.  It was something that I...  It was such an obvious setup. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  It was something like, you know, Star Trek, they would always meet these aliens that speak  English, and you don't know it's going to be some Miami joke after.  He's still trying to sell it.  Oh, yeah.  He's still looking for that target demo.  I'm trying to find some redeeming value.  It's going to work.  One day.  One day it'll work.  You'll find it.  You just did, like, improv after that?  Like, from stand-up to improv?  No.  Well, I was doing stand-up, and then I found the Groundlings Theater on Melrose, and they  had a whole...  You know, you could take their classes, and I immediately found out that I was more suited 
[02:51:00]  for that.  Plus, when you bombed, you weren't alone.  Right.  At least when you bombed, you were with a group of people.  You can blame it on somebody else.  Yeah.  There's no one to place the blame on.  You can walk off stage going, what the hell was that?  What were you doing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Immediately point the finger, and...  What's the rule in improv?  You don't say no, or you always go with what you're doing?  You can always...  Exactly.  You can never deny something.  Exactly.  Right.  What's the word, Amy?  Yes, and.  Oh, yes, and.  Yes, and.  Which is how sexting is supposed to go.  Yes, and.  Right?  You say something, and then somebody's supposed to...  And then someone's supposed to continue. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, okay.  She had a terrible sexting experience recently.  Yeah.  The guy was an asshole.  The guy did not yes end me.  Yeah, he's like, excuse me, but.  Yeah.  Which was really unsexy.  I have other ideas where I want this scene to go.  Did he write, my word?  Yeah.  What's going on here?  Pretty much.  He just wrote back question marks.  I am fanning myself right now.  Yeah, it was really disappointing.  Yeah.  I think improv is hard.  Like, I find that scarier than stand-up.  Like, to be able to go out there and just, I've watched some, bad improv is unwatchable, 
[02:52:00]  and good improv is fucking awe-inspiring.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah, good improv feels like you're watching a magic trick.  Yeah.  And it's incredible, but you're right.  And you have to go through the bad to get to the good, yeah.  We almost came out of the ground with some great people.  Bad people.  Like Phil Hartman.  Is Phil Hartman or Pee-wee?  Phil Hartman.  Jennifer Coolidge.  Pee-wee Herman, Jennifer Coolidge.  Uh, uh, uh, Lisa Kudrow.  Um.  Not familiar.  Uh, no.  No.  Okay.  Not ringing any bells.  No.  No.  Who are the ones, though, that never, you never hear from? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Like, I was here, well, the Groundlings.  Let me, uh, blast off some things.  Let me do those for you.  Oh, God.  And it's like, what about, uh.  Joey Pepitone.  Yeah.  He's in Boca now.  Not doing a whole lot.  Isn't John Candy?  Was he Ground-  No, he was Second City.  He was Second City.  But there's the Groundlings, Second City, and then, uh, UCB.  No, it's UCB.  Those are like the three big ones, right?  Those are the big three, three factories of comedy.  Yeah.  UCB.  If you want to make it, go right there.  Just do it.  Guaranteed.  You're going to be a star.  Pay your money.  You're in.  Your teachers who were in your class the year before. 
[02:53:00]  But that's the thing with improv.  You, it's just like stand-up in that you have to, you can kind of seem like you have  to suck at it for a while.  I've seen friends who, graduating shows at UCB, and they, they can't find the end to  scenes, so they literally just put the lights out.  So they move on to the next scene.  Wow, right.  They shut down the electricity, because it's that uncomfortable.  Kind of like an SNL sketch, when they just bring the applause up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go to commercial.  What do you do when you're bombing an SNL sketch?  Because that, to me, is the scariest thing, because I've never seen anybody break the  fourth wall and address it. 
[02:53:30]  Like, they're actually really good at not-  Yeah, this is going nowhere.  I just, yeah.  I know for me, in dress rehearsal, I, if the audience, if it was not working, the tendency  is to speed up and just get off, off the stage, but I would just purposely slow down  and torture, torture the audience, because they're like, if you, if you hate this and  hate me now, I'm just, you know what, I'm going to make it twice as long.  You're all going to need a shower or something?  Twice as long.  That's amazing.  That's balls.  I don't know what, I don't, I don't know what, why the masochist excited me would allow 
[02:54:00]  that, but I was just like, okay, you hate it, you're going to hate it a lot more.  Do you have a trick for not breaking?  Do you, like, think about something really sad, or you just, when you're in the scene,  you don't?  I'm always thinking about things that are sad.  Oh, my God.  I found out he was the darkest dude ever.  No, I don't know.  I just have been able to, you know, kind of commit to something, but yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not immune to it, but.  Yeah.  Have you ever, in a sketch, have you ever ruined it laughing or ruined it by breaking 
[02:54:30]  the fourth wall?  I, you know, I've been lucky that the times I've started breaking, at least on Saturday  Night Live, was usually when I was wearing a beard of some sort, so I could kind of hide  my laughter with keeping, you know, my beard from falling off.  So, in fact, this, that Blue Yostra Colt cowbell sketch we did, if you watch it, if you watch  it, I'm totally, I'm just laughing, but I have a big beard on, so you can't tell. 
[02:55:00]  And everyone else is fucking laughing on that one.  That was one that really got through.  I'm okay, but, you know.  That's a hard atmosphere.  We've been, you know, Daryl's been on, Colin, obviously, a million times.  That's a really, you can either take that or you can't, because that seems like a very,  very hard atmosphere to survive in if you're not thick-skinned.  Yeah, you have to be, you know, it's just, you're shot through a cannon in that thing,  and you have to, I mean, we were lucky when I was hired, you know, we had eight new cast  members, a whole new writing staff, so we were all thrown in together, and we didn't 
[02:55:30]  know any better, you know.  No one expected anything either.  It was like, oh, let's see what these clowns can do.  Totally.  And then it ended up being, like, amazing.  I mean, the worst part of it was the big press conference we had to do.  We were, like, Warren Littlefield, and we're, like, in front of all this media, and we're  just all sitting there, and we're all sweating and nervous, and in our little  brand-new clothes that the network's dressed us up in.  So what funny little sketches are you going to be doing?  What are your characters?  Hey, what kind of wacky sketches? 
[02:56:00]  What's your plan?  What are, you know, what are you like?  And we were just like, oh, my plan?  I'm just hoping not to get fired.  I just want to get picked up.  Yeah, so.  Do you have that fear at first that you're going to get dumped?  Is that, like, scary the first few times, like, where they cut a sketch, like, the first  time you're supposed to be on?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know, once again, like, like, Lauren, he had to use all of us, so he couldn't,  there wasn't a time to, you know, really pick favorites or anything like that. 
[02:56:30]  So we were kind of all used a bunch at the beginning, and, yeah, and if, you know, yeah,  you're kind of bummed if you're in one thing.  And, but then, but then later, if you've been on the show long enough, you're like, oh,  I'm only in two pieces.  Great.  Oh, yeah.  You get laid out.  I don't got to go to rehearsal.  Right.  The Rolling Stone article that was just out about you.  Yes.  It made it sound like you.  Which I haven't read.  Oh, it's great.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You sound great in it.  Okay, good.  Yeah, everybody likes you.  That's a relief. 
[02:57:00]  Everybody likes you.  Yeah, everybody really likes you.  Yeah, but they did, the interviewer painted it like you've had this very charmed, like, existence.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I kind of, I mean, let's face it, there's, like we were saying, there's just as many people  I can think of at the Groundlings.  Yeah.  Who have, you know, who are just as funny as me.  Automotive shop.  Yeah, so when I got hired at SNL, I'd come back to the theater and downplay it, because  you feel kind of, I'd be like, yeah, it's okay.  It's all right.  Yeah.  Living in New York.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[02:57:30]  I don't know.  Is it scary there?  Yeah, it's scary.  Yeah.  It's, there's nothing to do.  There aren't any good restaurants or anything.  But anyway, how are you?  Oh, you good?  Yeah.  Yeah, Wichita's been really good to me.  You got that Geico commercial.  Okay.  Yeah.  Great.  So, it's like.  It's tough to stay in touch with those friends, right?  It's, you know, but I just did a movie with Zach Galifianakis, and we were just talking  about how, you know, it is a game of inches, and that we both just got any other move or 
[02:58:00]  false step.  Yeah.  We literally could be doing, you know, being extras and whatever, and just trying to make  a living.  Here's how you know Zach is famous.  That's what Jimmy's doing.  Yeah.  Yes.  I'm working on my extra.  Here's how you know Zach is famous.  I was in a casino recently, and I fucking saw the hangover pinball machine.  The slot machine.  Yes.  And Zach is on a slot machine.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Yes.  I'm like, that's how you know you're famous, when you're on a slot machine in some random  casino.  The hangover slot machine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened with Joan Rivers? 
[02:58:30]  She said something recently, and she said, how can anybody be pissed at you for real?  No, not recently.  That was a long time ago.  It was a long time ago.  And this writer was like, anyone ever say anything bad?  And I just go, well, there was this one time, this weird article where, yeah, Joan Rivers  called me out out of nowhere.  For what?  And talked about when we met, and I was rude to her, and I'm like, I don't even know.  I don't know what she's talking about.  There's no way that happened.  And then I was trying to figure out, when did we ever even meet?  And then I figured out the only time was on when she used to do the red  carpet for, like, the Golden Globes. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, uh-huh.  And the only thing I could track it back to was, we were doing the red carpet, and  the time was running out for when you had to get in, because the show was about to  start.  And her producer was like, just walk in.  Go into the live shot.  And she's talking with Mike Nichols and Diane Sawyer.  So I just walk into the live shot, thinking she knows I'm going to do it.  And she's like, hello, hello.  Do you know who these people are?  And I was like, yes, I do. 
[02:59:30]  They're very famous.  Oh, hello, Mike Nichols.  Hello.  Yes.  Very important.  Yeah.  We are all important, famous people.  Uh-huh.  They're totally laughing.  And they're like, well, hello.  And then she's like, how could she not get that?  What are you doing?  It's hilarious.  I think she just didn't know.  Taking her red carpet duties very seriously.  I don't know.  That was the only place I figured out.  Why didn't you read the article?  Do you not read stuff about yourself, or you just haven't gotten to it yet? 
[03:00:00]  Just lazy.  Oh.  Sheer laziness.  No, I will read it.  I just, yeah.  You get involved in a lot of underground shit now, too, on the internet.  Just kind of friends of yours that are throwing stuff up online.  What made you go down that road?  Um, just, you know, just, you know, Funny or Die has been this great kind of playground  for, for stuff like that.  And, uh, and just, uh, it, I think it kind of scratches that itch you still have from doing 
[03:00:30]  sketch comedy where you have an idea and it's not really, it's, it's not really good  for anything but a stupid four minute thing on the internet.  Yeah, but it's amazing.  Just get together and, and, and take a half hour and shoot something and, you know.  But it's not, I mean, I've, I've filmed a couple of things with Funny or Die and they  are, it is one like a, they're like, here's your call time, here's your call sheet.  Yeah.  You're like, oh.  Isn't this the internet?  Wait a minute.  Yeah, I did my, my own makeup.  They're like, oh, well, we're starting over because we're a real thing, you know? 
[03:01:00]  It's no joke, Funny or Die.  Yeah, it's a whole, uh, well-oiled machine.  Yeah.  There was another comedy website which I had done something with Florentine on, um, and I  what, I forget what it was even called.  Yeah.  And it was doing okay.  Right.  But then fucking, that video with you came along, Funny or Die.  The landlord?  And wiped that site off the map.  My mom just sent me the landlord.  I'm like, wow, you're really on the cutting edge, mom.  Right.  You are ahead of the curve.  And she did not like it, by the way.  Oh, she was against.  Yeah.  She was against. 
[03:01:30]  Hey, how much Spanish can you, because I'm kind of amazed that you did a movie where you're  speaking Spanish for real.  Uh, yes.  Well, Spanish was my first language.  Oh my gosh.  So, yeah.  I'm finally, I've, all these movies in English, I've done phonetically.  Oh, yeah.  So, I'm finally just showing off the Spanish, yeah.  Are you going to do, like, Spanish radio interviews and stuff?  Like, can you, I have?  No, no, no, sadly.  No, I just, uh, I learned it for this movie, you know, I mean, I, I took it really seriously  because I didn't, I didn't want the joke of the movie to be that I spoke Spanish poorly. 
[03:02:00]  Right.  So, I wanted it to be, that you, you sat down and you're like, wait, he's really speaking  in English.  Oh, yeah.  It sounds, sounds halfway decent.  So, uh, so, yeah, I had to work, you know, probably a month prior to the filming and then  I would literally, the, the, uh, the translator would show up my house at five in the morning.  We'd drive to the set and go over the lines and then drive home and start the next day's  work.  And were you having nightmares in Spanish?  I totally was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was dreaming in Spanish and, uh, all these things, but, uh, but it was the only way I 
[03:02:30]  could kind of do it to, to, to make it authentic.  The movie's really funny.  I saw it.  I was at the South Beach Comedy Festival.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was like, that was a great crowd actually.  Yeah.  And what an interesting crowd.  Cause it's, you know, like the real telenovela stars were there watching it.  It's intense.  Is it, what's it about?  It's, uh, um, it's kind of, it's like telenovela meets a bad Mexican spaghetti Western.  And it's, you know, it's one of these heightened epic stories of, you know, two brothers trying  to save the honor of their ranch. 
[03:03:00]  That's, you know, fell on hard times.  And Diego Luna is my brother.  Of course.  Yeah.  Natural.  We've been bugged for years.  When are you guys going to do a brother movie?  Finally, finally happened.  Um, and he comes back to help, you know, he's, he's, he's gone off and, uh, as an international  businessman and, uh, comes back to save the day, but it turns out he deals, he deals.  He's a narco trafficante.  Oh no.  Yes.  Ooh.  Yeah. 
[03:03:30]  And my character does not like it.  Uh, you're bringing the family name down.  What are you doing?  So it's, you know, it's all that, all that kind of stuff.  Did you shoot in Mexico at all or no?  We shot in the Mexico of Southern California, Chatsworth.  Oh, same, same difference.  Same difference.  Same difference.  Yeah.  Mexico's scary lately.  There's a lot of stuff happening that's kind of dangerous.  I'm not familiar.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  It's frightening, man.  I would not go there.  Yeah, no spring break in Mexico City.  No, no, no.  I feel like I'd be a good drug mule just for, you know, in case anybody's-  You didn't know that.  Simply for the room, you could offer-  I can hold the balloons.  I just feel like I'm equipped. 
[03:04:00]  She's the only one that can bring a hail of pop.  Fucking hail.  A hail of pop.  I don't want to pat myself on the back, but if you're looking for a balloon holder, why  not not work?  And Will and I have worked together one time, and I thought we did very well together.  We did.  Tough crowd sketch.  Right.  Oh, gosh, yes.  You were the worst name of all time.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mark-  Legendary.  Tough crowd sketch.  It was-  Will played the lawyer-  Pete-  Wait.  What was his name?  Come on.  Pete Bentley. 
[03:04:30]  I think that was-  Colin gave awful names, and he goes-  On purpose, yeah.  Yeah, and mine was Marv Gresto.  How do you remember Marv Gresto?  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Because it was the greatest bad name ever.  When I read it in the fucking script, I went bananas.  I was like, this is the best thing I've ever read anybody write.  Because Colin, because it was such over-the-top nonsense, and he goes, and my associate, Marv  Gresto, here.  He's got to say the whole name.  Pete Bentley.  Yeah, first name and last name.  Colin's hilarious. 
[03:05:00]  He gives you quite a bit of guff on Twitter occasionally.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Yeah.  There was a whole-  Scandal.  Blaming you for things.  All your illicit drug use.  It was such obvious nonsense.  Yeah, drug use.  You're right.  Nobody believed it, except the media asked him about it.  He's like, that's scary that you guys are asking.  Yeah.  Like, read by Twitter.  He's joking.  Yeah, if you did any research and read 10 of Colin's Twitters, you would know that  he does nothing serious on Twitter.  But that's what's so crazy.  You know, everyone's just trolling for that stuff to find, pull a thing out. 
[03:05:30]  One tweet.  Here's the sound bite.  One tweet is a press conference.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Ooh.  Look at that.  Look at that.  All right.  Exactly.  What happened?  What happened?  Explain this.  Yes.  Right.  Yeah, Louis C.K.'s in some shit because of some of his Palin tweets that he made.  Yeah.  But he admittedly made those drunk from a plane.  I remember when he did that, and then he deleted them, and he's like, look, the next  morning he was like, I might have written some shit last night, and I didn't mean any  of it. 
[03:06:00]  I was like trying to apologize.  Plane drunk is a bad thing.  That's a whole different kind of tweeting.  And you're bored, and now you have the ability to tweet up there.  And you might die, so you can say whatever you want.  Yeah.  It's bad.  Exactly.  It's all bad.  Are you going to put...  Your back's up against the wall in that tweeting surprise.  You're almost compelled to tweet offensive, horrid things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you in a place where you, like, you worry, because you have a great career, and you're  well-known, and, like, where you worry about saying things like, eh, this could be a problem.  Like, do you find that you have to edit yourself a little bit?  I guess that's, like, the only downside of mainstream real fame is that you kind of 
[03:06:30]  have to watch it.  Yeah.  I mean, you, I definitely, I mean, especially with the whole social media thing, and you'll,  you know, anything that you say in an interview could be carried anywhere, anytime, and blah,  blah, blah.  Yeah.  Did that concern you when that happened with Colin, or were you more like, oh, what the  fuck?  I didn't know about it.  I didn't know about it until someone brought it up to me.  Oh, that's so sad.  It's all Colin talks about.  Oh, I never would have known.  And so I was like, did you see what Colin was doing?  I'm like, what was it? 
[03:07:00]  You had Colin Firth?  Yeah.  Wait, what Colin?  You had Colin Ferguson from jail?  Colin Powell?  Yeah.  Was it Colin Powell?  I mean, were we talking close circle of friends?  Former Secretary of State?  But I loved you in that sketch, because we'll play it.  He was right up to the elf movies, and they were so successful, and you come on with an  elf hat playing a lawyer, and Colin just brutalizes you for being a fucking, wearing  an elf hat in a movie.  But I was like, what a funny dude to come on and do that.  And then most guys would have a movie that's that big, and you're like, oh, no, I'm not 
[03:07:30]  going to.  But you just came out with that elf hat, and it was really funny.  Yeah.  You've got to kind of make fun of everything when you came.  I just felt that my part in it was you carried it.  You carried it.  I mean, that's the thing.  That's how he gets brought on stage.  You know this next guy from the Elf sketch.  Yes.  He's Bentley.  Of course, he played.  Marv Gresto.  Marv Gresto.  Marv!  Marv!  Over here!  Over here!  I was watching the Today Show this morning, and there was a bunch of kids with Marv Gresto  signs.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:08:00]  They know what they want.  MG sometimes, you know.  It's just a fucking wristband.  What was going on down the street?  There was some British boy band.  Was that what it was?  All right.  All right.  You guys have to get out of here.  One Direction.  Is that their name?  Why am I pretending like I don't know?  Of course, it was One Direction.  We see your T-shirt underneath.  Yeah, I was driving up, and there were just a bunch of kids crossing the street.  Yeah.  I'm looking at it.  Easy pickings.  Yeah.  Have you done anything dramatic? 
[03:08:30]  Because, like, or do you want to do anything?  Because Sandler went into, like, he did, I think, Spanglish.  Yeah.  And, like, sometimes for comics, and Jim Carrey has done some stuff that's dramatic.  Sometimes for comics it works.  Sometimes it doesn't work.  I did.  I had a thing come out last year called Everything Must Go that was totally dramatic,  which was kind of an indie thing that a lot of people didn't see.  But that was great.  I loved it.  Yeah.  And you were in the Woody Allen movie.  I mean, you were funny, but it was...  I was, yeah.  That was kind of... 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  That was kind of...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Stranger Than Fiction is kind of dramatic.  Yeah.  A little bit.  What are you the most...  Chairman Eric, that's a dramatic, very dramatic role.  This movie is pretty dramatic.  Oh, yeah.  It gets heated.  I cried.  Mostly I had my own stuff going on.  It was all about your sexing.  Yeah.  You don't know how awry things went.  You got plane drunk and went right to my screen.  That's the start of my movie.  Oh, God.  When you hear something, if people like...  Because do you read what critics write?  We always ask you...  Because sometimes people on Twitter will tweet me, and I'm like, you fucker. 
[03:09:30]  And I'm like, why am I responding to this guy?  There's five people following him.  What do I care for?  Yeah.  Once again, laziness.  But I don't really look at the critique so much in a way, only because even the...  Someone will send me one, like, hey, pretty nice review in so-and-so.  And I'm like, okay, great.  Let me click on.  I'll read it.  And it inevitably starts with, considering most of the things he's done, I hate.  This one actually surprised me. 
[03:10:00]  God damn it, yeah.  And I'm like, it can't even...  Yeah.  It can't even be good the whole way through.  Right, right, right.  So they're like, ah, don't even read the good one.  They cut his shit on you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  It's true.  Or even if it's all good.  This guy's usually a loud asshole.  But he showed amazing restraint in this role.  Yeah.  He's not a total buffoon.  Yeah, it's like praising you by destroying everything you've ever done.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, yeah.  But you're not fazed by it?  You're okay with that?  I would be if I looked at... 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, if I, you know, went through Rotten Tomatoes and checked it all out, I'd probably be...  Yeah, I wouldn't leave my house, probably.  We were talking about...  I just stay away from...  I just try to stay away from...  With Twitter and Facebook and whatnot, they have accessibility to people now that they never did in the past.  Yeah.  We talk about what it would have been like to tell Clark Gable he sucked back in those days.  It was impossible.  Yeah.  They'd write a fucking letter.  It would never get to him. 
[03:11:00]  It was like, you know...  Right.  Remember that scene in Mommy Dearest when they're signing the pictures?  Yeah.  And it's like the help and the maids are stamping...  Yes.  ...the signatures and putting them in envelopes?  You never...  Now it's like, hey, huge Hollywood star that's grossed billions, you suck.  Yeah, you can basically text them with Twitter.  They gave a direct text to you.  It's like you're texting people you never had access to.  Absolutely.  Do you tweet?  Are you on Twitter?  I tweeted for four days.  Oh, wow. 
[03:11:30]  You had your full...  I had my...  It was a glorious four days.  But I got criticism on the tweets that came back.  It was like, that wasn't funny.  It's not funny.  Dude, this is not what Twitter's for, because I was trying to promote some charity thing  I was doing.  They're like, that's not what Twitter's for, man.  Come on.  Man, we're not here for AIDS.  Make it count.  We're not here for AIDS.  That's not why we're here.  It's amazing how some shithead in his basement can actually tell him that's not what Twitter's  for when he's trying to promote a charity. 
[03:12:00]  But it's like, as performers, we read it.  Most times you don't let it get to you, but sometimes you're like, ugh, there's just something  so irritating about it.  Not that they don't like it, but...  I would love if there was a way, and there's no way, to track the percentage of population  that actually tweets.  Yeah.  It's probably, numbers-wise, this small handful of people that are on their thing every day  that all drive us crazy.  I thought you were going to say, I wish there was a way, and I was going to blow their phone  up in their hand the next time they try to tweet. 
[03:12:30]  There probably is a way.  Because the CIA probably has that way.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You make funny films look easy, which is really...  It's a...  Like, you make it look like, oh, that's an easy thing, and it's certainly not.  You have this...  Oh, thanks.  I don't even know how to describe you.  You have the fucking amazing deadpan.  Yeah.  I think legendary deadpan would be the way.  Yeah.  Just...  Like, how do you caricature all these...  You play an amazing parody of things.  You have a gift of showing how ridiculous things are.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, I think it's a lot of those movies I've gotten to do with McKay, Adam 
[03:13:00]  McKay.  You know, we met on...  At Saturday Night Live, and we're just kind of like, you know, kindred spirits.  Like, we both just thought the same thing was funny and the same approach, and I don't  know.  It's kind of, you know, put that together, and it seems to work.  What are you the most proud of right now?  Me or Will?  No, Jim.  Come on.  All right.  Probably my antique...  Lasting two minutes is not an accomplishment.  We want to hear some real gold. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Just like...  I'm most proud of...  Yeah.  Yeah.  My antique gun collection.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh.  Yeah.  4,000 guns.  Okay.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a lot of guns.  Look at them every day.  They're my children.  They're my children.  Wow.  That's great.  Yeah.  That's really great.  Yeah.  And what else?  Hey, this movie got subtitles.  I hope so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you can't read English, this is not the movie for you.  Yeah.  Going into a subtitle movie, sometimes you're like, oh, God. 
[03:14:00]  And then two seconds into it, you're just...  Well, maybe more than two seconds.  You're just kind of like, oh, okay.  Yeah.  Because I want to see the picture, but I want to read the words.  So I'm like, ah, fuck.  You know what's interesting?  We've done a big college screening program with this movie, and we wondered if that was  going to be the...  You know, if kids were going to be like, I don't want to read this.  I can't text while I watch this movie.  It hasn't come up once, which is good.  Really?  Probably because they are texting.  Yeah.  They read stuff all the time with the texting, so it's just right there in front of them. 
[03:14:30]  Any LOLs?  No LOLs.  The L, though, because it's Spanish, that would be more confusing.  Was the timing different in a comedy?  It's like, you know...  Yeah.  But was it different because people are reading it and laughing?  Did you have to pace it at all differently?  It didn't seem...  I don't know.  I mean, once you kind of got the meaning of what you were saying, it seemed to all flow  the same way.  All right.  I'll actually see this, because I don't mean, like, I'll actually see it.  I'll actually see it.  I'm going to throw you a bone, Will. 
[03:15:00]  I mean, it's radically different.  And it's, you know, we kind of make fun of clichÃ© views of Mexico and clichÃ© views  of the U.S. and all this stuff like that.  That's what's so interesting, watching it screened in Miami.  It's like the people that are sort of being parodied a little bit were watching it.  Oh, right.  They were loving it.  Oh, they were killing it.  Spanish-speaking people down there?  Yeah, they got a couple.  Wow.  Got a couple.  Yeah.  Mostly Polish, though.  Miami's mostly a Polish city.  Totally Polak town.  It's called Casa de Mi... 
[03:15:30]  How do you say this?  I mean, I know, but they don't.  Casa de Mi Padre.  Oh, my God.  What's that mean?  That means...  God, I have no idea.  No, that's House of My Father.  Casa de Mi Padre.  Which is a ridiculous title.  It's ridiculous that Jim couldn't translate that.  That's the easiest Spanish word.  Because it sounds like House of My Father.  It sounds very, yeah, very epic.  It's very manly and epic and huge.  Well, they're telling us Will has to go.  It's in theaters Friday.  I'm definitely going to support this because the balls to learn Spanish and do a comedy 
[03:16:00]  in Spanish.  You are a madman.  You can't...  Instead of doing the same thing or something that was similar, you just...  It was a 23-day fever dream, believe me.  Every day, it felt like I wrapped an entire movie.  Wow.  My brain was like, why did I agree to do this?  But it paid off.  It's funny and different.  You're doing God's work.  The Lord's work.  Thank you.  I can't say that about myself, but...  But it's nice to hear, right?  Yes, right.  So is Amy, though.  She took the Plan B pill.  She's doing God's work.  I took Plan B yesterday.  She's got life and death right in her womb there, and she chose death.  I'm in the midst of having an abortion as we speak. 
[03:16:30]  Well, so is our show.  The show has been described.  Well, yeah.  So I guess we'll be back in a minute, and, you know, I'm both a great guy, and...  Why should we?  What time is it?  All right.  We will come back because I want you guys to be able to give your little...  To plug our gigs and...  Plug our little shows on the road.  But, yeah.  So we'll take a quick break, and we'll be back.  Thank you, Will Ferrell.  Thanks, you guys.  Sirius XM.  This is the OVN F3 Show. 
[03:17:00]  When I wake up...  I remember this song, right?  Are we on it?  Yeah, we're back on again.  We're on.  It's okay.  Oh, what, are you going to get professional now?  All right, guys.  I'm ready.  Here comes the funny.  I didn't want off-air, Amy, to be on the air.  Off-air.  I'm just a sack of shit.  He's a funny guy, man.  Will, and he's a nice dude.  Yeah.  He's just nodded.  He doesn't give off that big dickhead celebrity vibe.  No.  He's a great guy. 
[03:17:30]  He's the best.  And he's done some entertaining stuff.  Yeah.  For the love of Pete.  Casa de mi padre.  You fucking Casa de mi padre.  Don't build a fence.  Casa de mi padre.  It comes out Friday, so I'm happy for him.  Yes.  And you were asking me during the break, Amy was asking me about Orlando this weekend. 
[03:18:00]  No, I was not asking you.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Thursday, and then March 29th through April 1 is Caroline's, and June 9th is myself, Artie,  Nick, and Dave Attell at Foxwoods in Connecticut.  Oh, it's funny that you bring up Foxwoods, because on March 24th, I'll be in Milwaukee at  the Pabst Theater and in Phoenix.  That's great.  I hope you have a lesbian experience with Shirley Feeney.  Oh, God.  The Pabst Theater.  Everything in Milwaukee has got to be beer-related, right? 
[03:18:30]  No, it's actually short for Pabst Beer.  Oh, okay.  It's the Pabst Smear Theater.  Everyone gets it free.  That's good.  The Shots Theater.  Wasn't that the beer?  Free.  Yeah, Shots Beer.  Oh, God.  Yeah, no.  Pabst is beer.  Free Pabst Smear?  That's nice.  Hey, plugs are a two-way street.  Oh!  Never have sex again.  Oh, that's fucking...  We're all, by the way, annoyed at each other's awful sex.  Yes, they're angering.  Oh, big.  Fuck her. 
[03:19:00]  God damn it.  Dummy.  I have a picture of my cock that I really like, but there's a towel on the floor, and it really  bugs me.  Oh, Photoshop it out.  Photoshop out the towel.  Yeah.  I've thought of that, but I'm like, am I that much of an addict where I'm going to Photoshop  out a fucking...  Do it.  A dick pic.  You know, a cock pic is supposed to be very spontaneous and send them.  You don't retouch.  I've been at like a tropical background.  The towel's just retouched.  Is it?  Yeah.  Did you use the rule of thirds on the photograph?  You know, that...  Ouch!  No, I don't know what you mean.  It's not bombing.  It's a lonely feeling. 
[03:19:30]  I literally don't know what you mean.  It's a lonely feeling.  It really is.  Whatever.  Just...  I was completely by myself there.  I can tap into feelings of when I've bombed on here still that make me shudder.  Yeah.  It's just...  It's just...  Yeah, photography...  People are going, ooh, photography jokes.  All right.  I understand.  What does that mean, even?  That in the frame, you should frame things off in thirds in the frame to make it more appealing  to the eye.  Yeah, yeah.  I've never heard that.  You wouldn't... 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  What did you mean?  Like if you center something?  Yeah, yeah.  Object in middle, equal, equidistant right and left.  Yeah, things like that.  And if you're going to put something on the side, make it the same distance as...  Oh, I get that.  It's some photography horse shit.  What am I going to do?  Let me put two cocks in there?  I'm sorry.  It's getting funnier as you explain it.  Oh, it really is.  Now it's a laugh riot.  Oh, jeez.  Let me tell you.  We need to go to dental school and get out of this business.  Yeah.  Carly, did you have fun?  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  Did you learn a lot?  You can grab that mic right there.  You can talk to them like, Carly. 
[03:20:30]  Don't be scared of it.  What did you learn?  Here, you can come here, Carly.  She's afraid of everything.  What did you learn today?  I learned a lot.  I learned, basically, not that I was into it, but now I'm never going to sext things out.  No, no, don't let that.  No, I've heard too many bad stories about it.  You know what?  Don't let it drive you away.  Embrace it and be good at it.  Just be good at it.  And that way...  I'll be a champion at it.  Yes.  Apply the yes and rule, no matter what happens. 
[03:21:00]  And then if things get too weird...  Yes, you can fuck me in the ass and I'll suck your dick.  Yeah.  Yes and.  Yes and then I'll watch your shit out of my hair.  Right.  And then you write, good night, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Will Fowler was pretty cool.  Were you nervous taking a picture with him?  I saw you kind of like...  Yeah, I was like cowering in the corner.  I was like, I don't want it to...  You are a little fraidy cat.  Yeah, I'm a scaredy cat.  Scared.  Scared, yeah.  Want to shit in a litter box?  No?  That's my texting.  I sext to that a lot.  Yeah.  You want to shit in a litter box? 
[03:21:30]  It's just great.  No hair pull area.  No hair pull.  No, no.  Don't be weird.  No hair pull.  Did he actually correct you and say no hair pulling?  Yeah.  On a text message.  That's the weirdest part.  This guy should be sure.  Yeah, anything goes.  Is he a funny comic?  I really don't care who he is.  Is he funny?  Yeah, he's funny.  Is his act...  Oh, Jesus.  No.  Is it centered around him being a gay Italian?  No.  Is his act...  Is he in a car insurance commercial right now?  Oh, shit.  Is his act...  Because to me, to be that unsexy, is his act revealing about himself at all? 
[03:22:00]  Or is it just a fucking...  Like, he might be funny, but is it more like, you know, hey, have you noticed when you gamble?  No, no.  He's funny.  Okay.  I wouldn't want to fuck somebody if they weren't funny.  I could care less if I'm fucking a chick.  It's different.  I don't care if she's reading the Unabomber Manifesto.  No.  I don't care how hot a guy is.  That's sexy.  If he opens his mouth and he sucks, then I'm like...  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, because I'm attracted to this guy, but he just...  He's the worst.  I was like, oh.  Well, you didn't know that when you started sexting with him.  How are you supposed to know? 
[03:22:30]  There was no evidence that showed that, but yeah.  Fucking go there.  Oral's a two-way street.  No, you keep saying that.  Oral goes both ways.  Goes both ways.  Come on.  It's the same basic thing, but he didn't even say two-way street.  Two-way street would have been funny.  I would have thought he was joking.  Like, hey, two-way street.  That's kind of like, ha, ha, huddle, huddle.  No hair pulling.  Hair pulling.  That should have been like, you know, oh, hair pulling?  Did you mean my asshole hair?  Yeah, my ass hair.  Like, that would have been good.  I like my hair pulled.  No, no.  My ass hair. 
[03:23:00]  Just pull it.  You just ended it.  I've said that before.  Yeah?  Yeah, I want you to, and I'll actually put tweedle my asshole hair.  Tweedle.  You've texted me that.  Yes.  I want you to take hair product and make a payus come out of my asshole.  Little payus.  Curly fries.  That is so hot.  Isn't it?  See, I know how to sext.  God.  I lie about my penis.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'll write stuff like, my shit is so big, you're going to get hurt, girl. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, my God.  She's like, who is this?  Wait a minute, what?  Oh, my God.  Well, that was a fun day.  It really is.  What a bunch of fun.  Thank you again, Sam Roberts, for working the board.  Thanks for what?  Doing his job?  That's good.  Well, you really sat there well.  Sam Roberts and board go hand in hand.  Oh.  Because that's what I am.  Get it? 
[03:24:00]  While you're talking.  Oh, shit.  See how he turned that right around on me?  Wow.  Turned it right around on me.  Damn.  All right.  And everybody else, thank you.  The lovely Carly.  Best of luck in your future endeavors, which couldn't be made better.  They could be made better if, you know, you're just a couple of favors.  Yeah.  I think the term Anthony is looking for is if you play the game a little.  Right.  It is a business.  Right.  And businesses do have their, you know, under the table, deals are made, things like that. 
[03:24:30]  Show business.  Business is a longer word than show.  Oh.  Never heard that one?  No.  Oh, shit.  That hasn't made it around.  I've heard it's show business.  It's not show friends.  That's right.  It's show business.  That's right, girl.  Yeah.  That is Jay Moore.  It's Jay Moore.  The great Jay Moore.  I believe it was Jay Moore who said it.  I'm quoting him like fucking, yeah.  Like he's Picasso or something.  No.  Guy that can't do a reference.  Picasso is the worst.  I was going to say Winston Churchill. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  Picasso.  Guy with the worst reference.  Yeah.  Fucking guy is talking to me like he's Michelangelo.  What?  I'll laugh because the cadence was funny.  But it doesn't, yeah.  You know, the best fucking analogy is I was watching Boogie Nights last night.  And when she made that little biography movie about Dirk Diggler.  Oh, yeah.  And he's sitting there trying to explain himself about anything.  And it's, that movie, scene for scene, is the funniest fucking movie out there.  It really is.  Like there's not one scene in there that isn't fantastic. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  When they're doing that dance and they're in the disco dancing and shit.  And just that horrid, vapid conversations they're having.  About their pants.  Yeah.  Oh, this is like Italian leather.  Yeah, Italian leather.  Amazing.  What?  What?  Yeah, no, it's magic.  It's an illusion.  What?  Thank you.  Fucking fantastic.  They were really defined characters though, man.  Oh, yeah.  That was a great fucking movie.  Oh, my God.  Everyone in that was, see, the film is depressingly good as a movie. 
[03:26:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  That's the first movie I remember seeing him in.  No lie.  That blew my mind.  Scent of a Woman.  He was?  Really?  Yeah, he was, hey.  Hoo-ah.  No, that's Al Pacino.  Hoo-ah.  No, that was, that was Al Pacino.  Okay, sorry.  Philip Simmer Hoffman was the rich kid who was like, Chaz, the move is there is no move.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yes, you're totally right. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, he was the one who sat in his daddy's pocket.  Hoo-ah.  Who are you doing?  That was him.  Oh, sorry.  I love you when Otto goes, that's a great Peter Lorre.  Peter Lorre.  Oh, he was good in that.  He's so good.  When he's chewing the pen, when he's like fucking, he's just so, and his fucking, the fact that  his shirt says fat stomach.  Oh, his fat stick.  Just a tadle.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking rich white kid.  But he was just a fucking lump.  Yeah.  He was a mush just looking at that giant cock and salivating.  When he started breathing heavy, trying to hold the fucking boom mic. 
[03:27:00]  Like, oh, God, he was just like, that scene, you're physically just like, oh, and then  in Big Lebowski, he was fucking hilarious.  That's where I noticed he was really hysterical in the movie.  And Boogie Nights blew it when they showed the big dick at the end.  They should have showed it in the middle.  The fact that that was the big reveal, it's like, who gives a fuck, man?  Yeah, at that point.  They should have showed that when he first got on the set, and then it would have been  removed, but then he shows it at the end.  It's like, ugh.  They shouldn't have showed it at all, I think.  I mean, I've got why they did it as a reference, but. 
[03:27:30]  But I think we all assumed he had a giant dick.  Oh, sure.  From the reactions.  Sure he did.  Sure he did.  I assume that about a lot of people.  I always thought that about Harvey Villachez.  I said for a little man.  I never want to see a picture of a dick.  No?  No, it doesn't do anything.  They never look good.  No, really, it doesn't.  They never look good.  I've asked for guys to send me pictures, but just like, sort of as entrapment, just to  have.  Oh, right, right.  In case I ever need them. 
[03:28:00]  But seriously, I like sending pictures, but I've never been like, oh, yeah, let me get  my hands on this.  It just doesn't do it.  Wow.  What about video?  Yeah.  I just like a nice guy jerking off into a sock.  That's what I want.  I can't even get out of bed without seeing that.  How about a guy sitting in the toilet just cranking my fucking legs up on a fucking, like,  that little thing that I use when I shit because it balances out my intestines.  Don't talk about it like everyone has one.  Yeah.  You know that little thing you put your legs on? 
[03:28:30]  Because it's better when you shit with your, I have a little stool I put my legs on when  I make doo-doo.  Yeah.  And it's because it's better for your intestines, your legs to be up a little bit.  I don't even know.  Who told you this?  It's common knowledge.  Fucking astronauts.  We're common.  That's why most of the world shits into a fucking hole in the floor.  I mean, that's just, that's why people in Africa give birth that way.  It's just, we're more comfortable that way shitting.  Put your feet up.  Jimmy has stirrups in the bathroom.  Yeah.  It always takes a little bit of digging with a gloved hand to get at it.  I don't drink a lot of water.  Put the speculum up his asshole. 
[03:29:00]  No, you gotta, um, my fucking feet are up.  And then it's Log City.  Log City.  Welcome to Log City, ladies and gentlemen.  Wasn't that Seattle back in the 1800s?  Log Plume.  Not sure.  Wow.  Hi, kids.  I had fun today.  I did, too.  That was good.  Yeah, that was good.  Amy Schumer, thank you so much for coming in.  I won't be here tomorrow.  I'll be gone.  Jimmy's not going to be in.  Jimmy.  Come on.  But, uh, oh, never fear, people.  Never fear.  I'm still coming in.  Oh, thank God.  I'm fucking coming in. 
[03:29:30]  Shane.  I know.  This is the actor I want to meet, but I won't be here, so I'm fucking pissed off.  Shane from Walking Dead.  Yes.  Ooh.  He will be in tomorrow.  Very excited about that.  He's hot.  He's going to take a picture with my cardboard cutout if they got it done.  Oh, they're supposed to get a cardboard cutout?  That's not scary.  Yeah, I know.  Way too expensive.  How much is it?  The place that we found that would do it wanted 400 bucks for it.  Why don't you just tell me I would have done it?  What's 400 bucks?  I thought it was going to go like $3,000.  Why don't you just tell me I would have paid that?  It's a goof. 
[03:30:00]  Way too expensive.  400 bucks.  400 bucks.  And then we'll have a Norton cutout for all kinds of hijinks.  You need it.  I want to have celebrities come out here and take their picture with it.  It's a bargain.  Why wouldn't you tell me that?  It's a bargain.  Because you were long gone when we found out.  Set it up in the lobby.  Just leave it there all day.  Put it on the elevator if people don't go on.  It's on the elevator.  I'll wait for the next one.  Thanks.  I've seen your work.  Oh, I know.  I would have paid it.  Yeah, see?  We took the picture.  Instead of telling me, look, it's 400 bucks, just nobody tells me anything. 
[03:30:30]  I'll give you 500 if you don't have it made.  I think you can do it overnight, though, one place.  If you do it now.  You can do it overnight?  Yeah, so it's like...  You should do that with your cockpit.  Oh, man.  Get a cardboard cutout.  I would love to.  Just have all the sores photoshopped off.  Oh, Jesus.  Right.  Oh, man.  Yeah, and the teeth prints and the fingernail that's still stuck in there.  You want the life changer?  Yeah, the life changer.  My dick has fingernails in it like the fucking...  It's like the well in Silence of the Lambs. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Where are you going, anyway?  You're out to...  I'm doing Light on a Mars.  But it's only...  It's the...  I don't know if it's all about...  It's that coulda, woulda, shoulda segment.  It's not my own segment.  No.  But it's fun.  They bring me out to do it.  Who else is doing it?  Is it like...  I never know.  I guess Ross Matthews and usually it's Heather McDonald from...  They're always on Chelsea lately.  It's usually those two lately. 
[03:31:30]  It used to be Ross and Rove McManus, but now I think it's Ross and...  And Heather.  But you never know.  The lead guest is Jonah Hill.  Oh, well.  What's left of him.  You'll be...  Yeah.  You'll be talking with him?  I'll say hi.  I'm sure.  I mean, I like the guy.  I do like him.  Yeah.  It was a politics thing why we didn't have him on the show.  Absolutely.  And I would tell him that.  Between him and his management or the fucking publicist.  Had nothing to do with him or us.  No.  Weird.  Yeah.  I was fine with saying no to that.  Yeah.  I was fine with you. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  I'm putting the blame on both people.  Okay.  And everybody involved except me.  Okay.  Yeah.  It wasn't my fault.  I pushed for that one.  Mm-mm.  I pushed for that one.  Yeah.  You certainly did.  Yes.  As we noticed on Twitter, the vote was two to one.  As was duly noted.  Duly noted.  All right.  Well, I guess.  We'll never get out of here.  Let's take a night off.  All right.  Whatever.  I'll see you guys Wednesday.  I'll see you tomorrow, people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then. 
[03:32:30]  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  Finally, the moment is at hand.  After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You look lonely in there, Sal. 
[03:33:00]  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  Isn't it great when you have a guest come in here and you're assuming and you're hoping  and you're thinking they're going to be funny and they're going to be cool based on the way  they appear on television based on the way their characters have been portrayed.  And then you meet them and they're both funny and cool.  That was Will Ferrell today.  Very much a treat having him in studio.  He's been in more movies. 
[03:33:30]  I mean, even before he was a giant star, like I totally forgot.  He was also starring.  He starred in Zoolander as the villain.  What was his name?  Mugatu.  Is that right?  Mugatu, right?  You forget everything he's done and there's no signs of stopping for this guy.  What I want to know, though, is so he's got Casa de mi Padre, right?  It comes out on Friday.  It's a Spanish language film, which he stars in.  He learned Spanish for it with English subtitles. 
[03:34:00]  Will Mars.  Will Ferrell.  No.  Will Ferrell.  No.  Will Mars have a more difficult time reading the English subtitles or understanding the Spanish language that's spoken?  I don't know.  I mean, he claims to be Puerto Rican.  He says English is his first language, I think.  But he does.  He's never.  He has a history of having a lot of trouble with both languages.  Well, I think for Mars, the subtitles would need to be in Spin English. 
[03:34:30]  Spin English.  And then everything would be honky-dory for him.  I mean, I would just love to know where his attention naturally focuses.  Roland, you're on a strong roll right now.  That's right.  Bruce has a power.  That's right.  Bruce gave him the power, the strength, the focus.  Bruce on Friday.  Yes.  Will Ferrell today.  Great appearance by an A-lister.  I know that makes your life easier.  He did a long time here.  And he did 40 minutes. 
[03:35:00]  He was supposed to do 20.  Yep.  And 40 minutes that flew by.  Sometimes I'm sitting here, because I'm sitting here, you know, manning the camera a little bit.  We got a tripod now, so I don't have to sit there holding it anymore.  But I'm sitting there filming.  And many guests, Roland, and I won't mention any by name, but many guests, I'll sit there.  And within 15 minutes, I'm like, all right, okay.  And it gets boring to me.  You know, I'm not listening the way you might be at home.  But sitting here, videoing, it gets boring.  The time doesn't fly by.  Will Ferrell was one of the few interviews that it didn't feel like 40 minutes. 
[03:35:30]  It felt much briefer than that.  Was he...  He's super nice.  No, he's just a great guy.  He was taking pictures with everybody after the interview.  Yeah.  And Roland, he took a picture he took with Roland was him basically avoiding touching Roland.  That's right.  With his hands up in the air.  That's a good one.  That's right.  I'm going next, because I booked him.  Get the fuck away from me.  You're a new confident man ever since management's on your side.  No, ever since Bruce.  See, little things that make me happy.  Bruce juice.  Yeah. 
[03:36:00]  Bruce juice.  I'll drink it.  You drank on the Bruce juice.  Yeah, I pet him too.  He rocked by me.  I'm like, Bruce.  You got lots of pictures of him.  Oh, yes.  You filled up Twitter and Instagram.  You were probably the number one concert photographer in terms of people who went there.  I would say Norton and Anthony, they were more focused on the pictures that they got with celebrities.  You were all about what was going on on that stage and documenting it for the people.  I ran to Scarlett Johansson.  I ran to everybody.  I didn't care.  Did you really?  Jim mentioned this in the first hour. 
[03:36:30]  He said that you ended up in the third row.  We were watching you on one of the YouTube videos.  If you look at the crowd, you could see you.  And that you had better seats than Tom Hanks, better seats than Scarlett Johansson.  Yes.  Better seats than any of these massive celebrities that showed up to this thing.  They're not diehards.  You're the diehard.  They know when Bruce looks down, I'm with them right there.  And that's what Bruce wants to see.  That's all he wants to see.  He wants to see a celebrity tweet or Googling or just calling people.  Hey, Roland, how many celebrities do you think took a picture with Bruce that night? 
[03:37:00]  Why would you?  Not too many because it was tough.  How many pictures do you think his fans got with him?  A lot.  I mean, Tom Coughlin, though, I think he was the most accosted person.  Well, look, I'm just saying, I don't know the Bruce culture, but it looks to me that Bruce talks a big-ass game, but then, you know, when it really comes down to taking care of his fans, is he really there for them?  Or is he there to cater to his celebrity fans?  No, he's there for the fans.  It just was a special night. 
[03:37:30]  Rolando's was in the third row.  Sure, but that was because of his gig.  It wasn't because he was a fan.  Is it because of your gig?  Well, no, because it was because of his gig, they would probably let Scarlett Johansson take the seat.  Well, Scarlett Johansson probably has a little more clout around SiriusXM than Roland does, who books talent.  She is the talent that's being booked.  Yeah, she was nice.  She was talking to people, but I was like, people are going to up here to get pictures.  I saw lights dimming.  I'm like, I'm out of here.  How did it make you feel that Jim and Ant talked about what happened at the actual concert itself for about five minutes and then spent the next 20 talking about the outskirts? 
[03:38:00]  No, no, no.  Not to see.  They were talking about the pictures they got with celebrities, the after party, this and that.  They had a great time.  But, I mean, Anthony even said he wasn't there for most of the concert.  He was at the bar.  He didn't know any of the songs.  Well, that's why they put the diehard fans in the first four rows.  Would it have annoyed you if somebody like Anthony had been sitting next to you who, when Bruce, when whatever song that starts with piano started, Anthony starts yelling at the top of his drunken lungs, sing us a song, you're the piano man? 
[03:38:30]  Would that bother you?  No, they're probably throwing him out.  Nobody threw any of that.  He did it.  Nobody could hear.  It was so loud.  He said that one guy, and this is why I was thinking of you, because there was one guy sitting in front of him who just turned around and said, wrong guy.  I, Bruce Springsteen fans get annoyed when somebody's there being obnoxious.  Because they don't get the humor in it, because they're all just New Jersey people who are just too dumb to understand humor. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, but if you were at a primus show and somebody was shouting the lyrics to another band's song, you probably would be like.  They wouldn't be able to shout lyrics because they would be too high.  They wouldn't be able to put sentences together.  Well, maybe that's true.  Some woman was at my seat, though, and I went to get water, and the woman goes, this is my seat.  I was like, look, you had two seconds, woman, before I become nasty.  Was it her seat?  No.  It was your seat.  It was my seat.  And she goes, how nasty will you be?  I said, you'll see in one minute.  Because Bruce is your shit.  Yeah, and she looked at me. 
[03:39:30]  I go, I'm not fucking around.  And she got her stuff and left right away.  I gave the death look.  Yeah.  Did you leave that seat all night?  Fuck no.  No.  You would have pissed yourself.  No, like someone, some girl tried to crowd in next to me, and I said, look, honey, I'm here for Bruce.  Get the fuck away from me.  Somebody actually called in to my show on Sunday because they were so curious.  You didn't end up getting a photograph with Bruce this time.  No, no, but it wasn't the occasion to.  It wasn't about that.  No, I was just very grateful that I got a great seat.  That's what I was asking Jim about.  I had a great time. 
[03:40:00]  If I got the picture, I'd send the cake.  If I didn't, I understand.  I'll try another time.  To you, the experience is what you valued.  Yeah.  And, I mean, you didn't need to take a picture standing next to him because you're sitting there watching your idol.  Yeah.  The greatest musical influence in your life, which, if you know Roland, obviously you can hear in his speech, he's a melodic guy.  The greatest musical influence in your life.  He's three rows away from you.  He ran by me.  Pat my stomach when he ran by.  He didn't.  Yeah, I pat him on the back. 
[03:40:30]  Did he really pat you on the stomach?  Yeah, because he ran by twice.  So I was like, hey, I'll be your Buddha.  That's a pretty valuable commodity, isn't it?  So, you know what?  I didn't care.  I had a great time.  A hell of a show.  It seemed like you were having a blast.  And then on Saturday, the day after the concert, you decided to take all the pictures that you had already posted on Twitter and post them on Instagram.  And I posted most of them on Facebook.  Then people started tweeting them, like, their own pictures.  They started getting, like, you know what?  Fuck everybody.  I took them all down.  You did?  Yes.  Because you didn't want them reading.  No.  No.  Because they're taking credit for it. 
[03:41:00]  I was like, assholes.  Roland was very excited about this Springsteen show.  And sometimes when Roland gets excited or he gets sugar in him, very much like when we talked about Roland completely trashing E-Rock's office and smearing French fries everywhere.  That was because he was excited because he had had Wendy's and a Frosty.  And a large Mr. Pibb extra jolt.  Imagine how excited he would be for a Bruce Springsteen concert.  So on Friday, Roland and me were in the office, and I was scolding Eric because â€“ or not scolding him. 
[03:41:30]  I was questioning as to why there was no phone screener while the after show was on, which, Eric, is that something that's been addressed?  No, I forgot to talk to the person who was supposed to be on the phone.  Because I found out Club Soda Kenny was the one who was calling on the hotline, but nobody picked up his call because they decided they had better places to be while a live show was on.  Eric, you know I'm not blaming you because you're there.  I see you in the monitor, but I need you to â€“  And we were doing something.  I was looking over there while we were talking.  You can't have your eyes in all places at once. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  You're bugging out during my Bruce moments.  I wasn't bugging out.  I was simply saying it's a live show.  You were having a woman-woman.  We need to have a phone screener.  And Roland started saying, hey, we need a phone screener.  We need a phone screener.  Yeah, shut up.  I'll tell you to Bruce.  Right.  So what did I do?  I started taking every item off your desk and throwing it around your office.  Yeah, and then Rob and Gary goes, like, what's this mess?  And you go, we're on through it, which I did, and they didn't believe me.  No, what happened was Rob and Gary, our bosses, walked by, and they said, Roland.  And you go, Sam was throwing things all over my desk. 
[03:42:30]  And I looked at them, and I said, yeah, guys, I was throwing all Roland's stuff on the floor.  Now, I was admitting guilt, but when I said it like that, for some reason, they didn't believe you.  And they thought that you were doing it.  Hang on, we have a hotline call.  I guess this is in reference to what we were just talking about.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  Yeah, I've been on hold since Friday.  Well, I'm sorry.  We didn't have a phone screener.  All right.  I got to go anyway.  I just wanted to mention Club Son of Kenny on Facebook, and I got to hang up before somebody gets mad. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, that's obviously in reference.  Thank you, Kenny.  That's obviously in reference.  It's Eric, you remember when Danny and Troy were saying they didn't appreciate Club Son of Kenny calling into the show.  Yeah, but I don't see any problem with it.  But he must have been listening, and now he's hurt.  Kenny hears all.  He does hear all.  Nothing gets past him.  So I threw Roland's stuff all over the floor.  The bosses thought Roland did it.  Roland then â€“  Wait, was I in the office while this was going on? 
[03:43:30]  Yes, you were.  And I didn't notice this?  No.  You were just trying to ignore all the bullshit that was happening around here.  You put your headphones on, and you ignored us.  So I went to Roland after the bosses left, pointed my finger in his face, and said,  Ha-ha, you've set up a reputation for yourself where no one believes you.  So Roland took a full can of Club Soda, thinking that I would move, and threw it towards me, dousing me from head to toe with Club Soda.  I'm in the cleaner.  At which point he looked at me with his eyes wide and said, You didn't move. 
[03:44:00]  And I said, No, Roland.  And Roland said, Uh, uh, uh, uh, don't worry about it.  Club Soda cleans.  It doesn't make a mess.  It cleans things.  And I said, Roland, uh, I'm not worried about it, because luckily for you, we have lots of cans of Club Soda in the fridge.  And Roland immediately said, Wait, I got it!  I got it!  Lunch for a week.  That's right.  And so, we had lunch on Roland, because he threw Club Soda all over me and was afraid of the repercussions.  Yes, I don't want anything about Bruce's stuff to get messed up.  But, you know what, I'm feeling, maybe we'll forget the whole lunch thing. 
[03:44:30]  You set up the Will Ferrell picture, nice for us.  You had a great time with Bruce.  Maybe we'll forget all about that.  And you have your interview coming up with, uh, CJ.  Right.  You set that up.  So, you know what, you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.  Maybe we'll forget all about the whole lunch thing.  I'll do at least two days for you.  You will?  Yes, I will.  You have a good heart.  Um, Bruce was awesome.  So, I was so excited.  You're still getting over that.  Dude, when, but when John Landau walked up to me and said, Who are you?  You're in every shot.  That made, that made my year.  We were just watching a video.  I love John Landau.  And I immediately, I immediately saw you in the crowd with your Bruce shirt on, of course. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, yeah, I was so excited.  Oh, my God, it was hilarious.  But, I mean.  Because he said, uh, he has Jamie, how many shows have you been won?  He goes, What?  And how many is that for you?  Like, oh, way over 200.  And then John Landau goes, Yes, my boy.  And I was so happy.  I loved, listen to the first hour of the show if you missed it.  I loved hearing Ant's stories about, um, just how obnoxious he was.  Because he got all, he was all, he was drunk.  Yes, yes, I know.  Um, he didn't, he didn't know the songs.  No.  And so he said if he didn't know the song, he was going to go to the bar. 
[03:45:30]  Which meant he was going to the bar a lot.  95% of the time.  And he started, not only was he singing the Billy Joel song, but he started, when there were horns on,  he started doing that, like singing along with the horn.  Oh, man.  I'm so glad.  I'm just pissing off everyone around him.  I'm so glad he nascent next to me.  Because the Bruce fans.  It's beyond nuts.  And that's what I was saying to him.  That's why I thought it was so funny, because this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing for a Bruce fan.  It's the Apollo.  It's Apollo.  How many people?  1,200.  1,200 seat venue for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. 
[03:46:00]  It's the smallest venue in his plate since, like, the 70s.  Mm-hmm.  For one night off.  And now, they're massive.  So, you were in the third row.  That's something that management hooked you up with.  Correct?  Yeah.  Is it confirmed that you're a sellout?  Is that...  We all are, in some ways.  Well, how do you feel about management?  I love them.  You do?  You're a big fan of...  I love...  I love...  I love Ross, Blatter, Rob, Gary.  What do you think about the way, not only this channel, but the whole company is run? 
[03:46:30]  Beautifully.  You think it's pretty much perfect?  Fantastic.  Whatever they think, it's fine with me.  You love it.  I love it.  Yeah, I guess you're a sellout.  The Bruce juice is delicious.  Yeah.  When I see Bruce, I'm so happy.  Roland's still excited about the Springsteen show.  That was a great show.  But I was talking to him, because he wasn't here at the beginning of the show, and he couldn't  be happier that he was seated far away from Anthony and his obnoxious behavior.  Oh, yeah, of course.  It wasn't that bit.  Yeah, but Roland says that he doesn't even like having people sing the Springsteen songs. 
[03:47:00]  I want to hear you.  If I have...  If I hear you, you're going to hear from me.  Yeah.  Like, enough.  Yeah.  But did I not try to get you a picture of Springsteen?  You were beyond amazing.  I mean, even at the party, you were like, Bruce, he just turned around.  I was like, what?  He turned around.  He's like, huh?  I was pointing at Roland.  Yeah.  Well, you got your Bruce shot in the elevator.  Yes.  But even in that...  If that situation, I would still try to get Roland first.  I would want one, and I would get one. 
[03:47:30]  But in that moment, I would be unselfish.  No, Jimmy was beyond amazing.  He was looking out for me the whole night at the after party.  You're all smiles.  Oh, I love Bruce.  Roland loves Bruce.  He loves everybody.  He loves management now.  I mean, he...  Roland...  That's all it took.  Roland...  Yeah.  And that's...  I guess that's a lesson for everybody to learn.  Just give somebody a nice pat on the back.  No, that's any Bruce.  I'll be out of your hair.  Well, I meant in a more general sense.  Oh.  Because I was looking right down.  I was right above Roland.  Oh, that's right.  Because, Troy, you were at the Bruce Springsteen concert as well. 
[03:48:00]  And I could watch Roland the whole time.  And it was almost like a religious experience for him.  What's he like at these concerts?  You could tell he's like way into it.  And he's just kind of moving.  I just saw the back of him.  But there were times that like his hands were up.  Like there was a preacher in front of him.  You have to.  And Bruce goes...  Does he dance?  Who, Roland?  Roland.  He moves around.  You could tell he's into the music.  He doesn't...  He's not like acting ridiculous.  And then when Bruce goes for Clarence, you have to raise your arm.  And did Roland?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  It looked like a religious service.  It was.  Was Roland's focus ever removed from the stage or wherever Bruce was in the venue? 
[03:48:30]  Well, Bruce came down a couple times really close to him.  Uh-huh.  And you could just see him like scrambling for his phone.  And like he was just freaking out.  And then Bruce came running down the aisle.  And then Roland goes and like pats him on the back.  Like there he is.  Like you're doing a good job, buddy.  Yeah.  Atta boy, Bruce.  Did you freak out when he came into the crowd?  Like, oh, what am I going to do?  Just pat him on the back.  As long as a woman, I'll be soaked.  Yeah.  Would you give Bruce Springsteen a blowjob?  Yes. 
[03:49:00]  You would.  I'm not gay, but if he needs me, I'm there for him.  Not even any question.  Not even if he does...  If Bruce was like, hey, Roland, why don't you come blow me?  And I'd go, do you know what?  If I get a picture afterwards, boo!  What if you get a picture with Bruce, but the only picture you get with Bruce is of you blowing him?  What a great shot, dude.  I would do that.  If I get a picture of blowing Springsteen, I'd take that in a second.  So you would blow Springsteen if somebody could take a picture of it.  I would just hold it in my mouth.  I wouldn't fucking pump up and down, but I would fucking tug it and get a heart, and 
[03:49:30]  then just put it in my cheek, and then thumbs up the camera.  That would be my Twitter pic.  And then I'd go, would you play Incident for me?  Was that?  Would you play a song request?  If he was humming Incident on 57th Street.  I would.  He was good, man.  I'm actually looking to go and download his song now.  Which one?  We take care of our own.  That's the new big single.  I don't think it's, I don't think you get the melody a little wrong there.  Yeah, I do.  It's like, we take care of our own.  We take care of our own. 
[03:50:00]  That's what Aint was doing while the trumpets were playing.  Da, da, da, da, da, da.  But even he did a Smokey Robinson song, which was amazing.  Yeah.  I would rather have heard fucking My Hometown, which I love.  Did he do Incident on 57th Street?  No, this one was mostly, he really, he really focused on the set list of what's going on  with the recession, what's going on now.  Give me that set list in particular.  He didn't do.  No Born to Run, No Glory Days.  No.  Because it wasn't. 
[03:50:30]  I wonder if he'd known who he was.  Because it's a small, I didn't recognize any songs, but it's a small venue.  So, for you to get Bruce in the Apollo, for us, it was, I saw Michael Douglas walk in.  I was like, and Tom Hanks.  Did you see Captain Zia Jones was there?  She could have took a fucking, she could have laid naked on the floor and stepped on her  face to get a picture with Tom Hanks or fucking, or the lighting camera.  Was she in Wall Street?  Exactly.  What were you going to say, Troy?  Well, it was funny because we went out to get some barbecue beforehand. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, okay.  So, he's hooked up with the steak.  Now, all he owes you is the.  No, no, no.  We split the bill.  Oh, this doesn't count then.  No, no, no.  When is steak and a handjob day?  I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  We'll figure it out.  But he was giddy.  He's just sawing through his steak and he's just, he's talking about Bruce.  And then we got into the taxi and we're paying the bill for the taxi.  He's already out of the taxi, like out on the curb, like ready.  And then we're walking and people are like, do you have an extra ticket?  And he looks at them and he goes, Bruce!  And then he keeps walking. 
[03:51:30]  And the next person's like, does anybody have an extra ticket?  And he'll be like, Bruce!  And he was just walking like a man on a mission.  Because we had to walk up this long hill and the people were walking by me.  I was just screaming at them.  You just screamed Bruce.  In the middle of Harlem, by the way.  Like a madman.  Like a lunatic.  I could have a jacket on.  I was just screaming like a madman up the hill.  Was it possible to have any conversation that didn't revolve around Bruce during dinner?  No.  No, it was pretty much focused on Bruce, which was cool.  Are you a Bruce guy?  You know what?  I don't really care for Bruce, but after seeing him, he's a great showman. 
[03:52:00]  He put on a great show.  His band is amazing.  He looked great, too, right?  Yeah.  He comes out and he's wearing like a leader.  He's 62 years old.  I know what the song sounds like.  I like it.  I didn't know it.  We played it on the show.  It sounds amazing live, though, too.  Does it?  It sounds way better live.  We take care of our own.  Something you should work on while you're listening to it.  We take care of our own.  Care of our own.  You got the lyrics down.  The melodies are still, you're struggling with.  And he opened up like what James Brown opened up back in the 60s where he introduced himself. 
[03:52:30]  Bruce introduced himself.  Yeah, that's why he did it.  Was he doing James Brown's intro for himself?  Yeah, he just tweaked it.  James Brown did it when he first did Apollo.  Was this the best Bruce show you've ever been to?  It's up there.  Just one of the classic ones that you're there.  Not too many people were able to get in.  What's the best?  Does this beat?  Because you went to the Today Show and saw him rehearse, correct?  Yeah.  Does that beat the Today Show or no?  I went to a bunch of rehearsal shows. 
[03:53:00]  I'll tell you what.  The show's different, though.  Springsteen will remember this one.  If you see McCartney or Springsteen 10 years from now and say, I saw you at Yankee Stadium.  Which night?  But I see you at the Apollo.  I know exactly the moment, the show you met, and I'll probably remember most of the songs I did.  Of course, for McCartney, Roland would have to say, I saw you at the Apollo.  I fell asleep during your sound check.  Exactly.  He didn't do it for me.  I need Bruce.  Right.  Bruce had his pump band.  I had a blow going through me.  Troy, you saw both McCartney and Springsteen live at the Apollo.  Yeah. 
[03:53:30]  This is quite a feat.  Yeah.  Who was better?  Oh, I mean, McCartney's, he's a fucking Beatle.  You know what I mean?  You don't get any better.  For me, in my musical world, you don't get better than the Beatles.  It's hard to say, because they're, like, Springsteen was so high, McCartney did a bunch  of classics, though.  McCartney did Beatles songs.  People, I would imagine, would be upset if McCartney hadn't done any Beatles songs.  Like, it's where, like, Bruce is, you know what I mean?  Like, nobody wants to hear McCartney do no Beatles songs in a show like that, whereas  Bruce can get away with doing, like, all new and obscure stuff.  Well, it's, it's, on, on the pecking order, um, you know, McCartney is above, like, you 
[03:54:00]  know, Springsteen would have been in the crowd watching McCartney.  You think that's unfair, the pecking order, Rowan?  No.  I mean, he's a Beatle.  Right.  I mean, yeah, everyone idolizes him, but Springsteen was amazing, man.  I enjoyed McCartney more just because I know more of the songs and I'm more of a fan.  Yeah.  But I, I loved Springsteen's show a lot.  I saw one of Rowan's pictures, Springsteen was up on the balcony.  How did he get up on the balcony?  He ran right up the stairs. 
[03:54:30]  So he went up the stairs and then he came out over the ledge?  Yeah.  It's dangerous.  Oh, I thought he was going to hurt himself.  Like I'm saying, come down, be careful.  Thank you.  And then he was up on one of the balconies and he jumped down.  He grabbed a pole and slid right down.  This guy, man.  He's a monkey.  Yeah, he ran behind people, ran behind their seats.  He must do a lot of cardio.  Shit.  I mean, because the thing is though, he did it straight.  I mean, without even breaking, he just went one after another and he just kept on going.  How long was the show? 
[03:55:00]  Two hours and change.  Man.  And, but usually like other people, like.  And it was still good.  Like, Jim.  The encores were like a minute.  Even though you didn't know any of the songs, it was still good?  Yeah.  I only knew the Smokey Robinson song.  Yeah.  I didn't, I didn't feel like I needed to leave.  I wasn't bored.  I wanted to stay on the band.  I couldn't believe that it was over a two hour show.  I mean, he was really fucking dynamite.  Death Star Hometown, the new song, was amazing live.  Well, Roland, I'm glad you got to experience that.  What's it called?  Death Star Hometown.  I was a great, that was a great one too.  Was that when he was marching?  Yeah.  And then he had the drum, boom. 
[03:55:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was great.  Yeah.  And then there was, you know, We Take Care of Our Rooms.  But of course, Badlands.  Yo, work on the melody.  But Jake Clemens was amazing.  Clarence's nephew.  Oh yeah, he pulled it off.  He was very good.  The one thing today on the show that made me laugh harder than annoying people at the  Springsteen concert was what Jim would be like if he was drinking today.  And how he would be doing the shows.  Just Jim coming on and just cursing at everybody and getting emotional on the radio. 
[03:56:00]  And just, I would be embarrassed, I'd be one long act of humiliation.  You'd just be constantly trying to prove that you're more than a comedian and you're  more than the jokes.  You're not the funny man.  I can fucking act.  Wait, you got sober at 18?  Yes, I did.  And you know though, that this is what would happen if you started drinking again.  Of course.  I try to tell people, they don't understand how you could do that.  You called the FBI.  That's what you used to do.  Yes, I did. 
[03:56:30]  And I remember, when I was even younger than that, and I think the statute of limitations  has passed, I told you we went to the North Brunswick Public Library and tried to call  it a bomb threat to the White House.  Why?  I was probably 14.  I mean.  You were just drunk.  I didn't know if I was drunk or we just thought it would be funny to do.  I don't remember how we got put through to the White House or we just told the operator  that we were bombing.  You know, she probably, nothing just happened, but I was just a little douchebag.  But your parents thought you were like an angel, right?  Yeah, I called the Klan one time when I was drunk.  There was a Klansman who I looked him up on information. 
[03:57:00]  I told him how racism was bad.  So it's not like you're sitting there pranking all the time.  You're like, you're all drunk and you're like, I'm going to go make a difference.  Yeah, I was like that guy.  And I had like a real conversation with an ex-Klansman.  Because you were drunk at 14?  Yeah, I was 16.  He was a preacher in the Klan, but he was out of the Klan when I called him.  He's like, I'm out.  Did you get through to him?  Yes, I talked to him.  No, but I mean, like, did you penetrate that?  No, he was already out of the Klan.  And he was like, I'm not that guy anymore.  And you're like, you don't understand.  That's when I was in my wigger phase where I was talking like a little homeboy. 
[03:57:30]  So you weren't even like legitimately fighting against racism.  You were just trying to do something that a black guy would think was like good.  Yeah, good.  So it's like if I was going to get beat up in New Brunswick, I'd have something to talk about.  I call him, you get drunk.  And before you got beat up by a black guy, I try to tell him that you called it Klansman.  Yeah, yo, man, I was talking that motherfucker.  Would you really talk like a black guy?  Yeah.  I did it before it was fashionable.  How would you talk?  Just like that.  Horrible.  You wouldn't really.  Horrible.  Not like.  You wouldn't put it on that heavy.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:58:00]  You would.  I was humiliating.  It's humiliating.  Would you do it at home with your parents?  Yeah.  What would they say?  What could they say?  I think my father would just look at my mother's vagina and boo.  Just burn it.  But I did that when I was, I think, 16, 17.  I was looking at that.  That was when hip hop was just starting to get fucking popular.  But your parents never said, Jimmy, you don't talk like that.  I don't remember.  No. 
[03:58:30]  Because it was such a weird.  Because if it was 10 years earlier or 20 years earlier, I would have been a hippie.  Or 10 years earlier, I would have been a fucking whatever the burnout thing was.  And it was just this desperate need.  That's why I hate people who do it so much now.  Because it's so obvious and I spot it so easily.  When I was dating a black girl that my mom didn't like, and I was, I mean, I've always  listened to hip hop music on, you know, whatever, some level.  But I'd be, I also listen to stuff like the Beach Boys and things like that.  And my mom started trying to have a conversation with me saying that she thought I was changing 
[03:59:00]  as a person because she said, you know, all of a sudden you have all like, you know, this,  these rap CDs and just a few months ago you were listening to the Beach Boys, but it was  really just because she didn't want me to date that specific black chick anymore.  She didn't care about the music.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She would probably just, would she throw little jabs at you?  Like, well, I could make, I could make some cookies or perhaps a corn muffin.  Yeah.  Just what you'd really want.  Little things like, we're all having apples. 
[03:59:30]  I guess you want watermelon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sam's mother's veiled racism.  I was going to grill the chicken, but I guess Sam is going to want it fried today.  Yeah.  But she would say it real loud like, hey, Sam, you want it fried, Sam?  Your mom's the nicest lady and she's just a horrible racist.  My girlfriend is just sitting right there like, is this, she's being racist right now.  Don't worry about it.  Well, she was talking pig Latin, but everybody knew what she meant.  Yeah.  Is your mom going to bake this week?  You've had enough excitement, Roland.  I mean, at this point, you need to calm down a little bit. 
[04:00:00]  Shut the fuck up.  You see what I mean?  This is what happens when Roland gets excited.  The other thing, Troy, you brought in a friend of yours today.  Yeah.  Carla.  Who is that bitch?  Carly.  You can come up and sit down and join the show, Carly.  Um, we never really figured out how you and Carly know each other.  Carly's 21.  Right.  You're significantly, significantly older than 21.  How do you know each other?  I mean, that's not that.  They think that we hook up.  No, we've never hooked up. 
[04:00:30]  I wouldn't blow it up if you did.  What do you mean?  I wouldn't, like on the air, I wouldn't.  Oh.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  We've, honestly, we've never hooked up.  Why not?  Did Troy ever take it out and show you?  No, I've never, it's not like that.  No, I've been nothing but a gentleman.  He was pointing at his bulge.  You know what's on, you know, there's just a layer of fabric and you know what's there.  Yeah.  Yeah, no.  There was no bulge, bulge pointing.  How come?  How come you've never done anything like pointing at your bulge, Troy?  To Carly?  Well, I mean, I've done it to other people, but not her. 
[04:01:00]  You just haven't, not yet.  No, no.  I mean, you know.  It's not what it is.  Well, I mean, we're just, we're just friends.  Where did you meet each other?  Well, we actually met on Instagram, believe it or not.  Really?  Yeah.  And then we started talking on there.  And I forget who started following who.  And then I just started following her on Twitter and I thought she was funny.  And Carly, what's your Instagram name?  Carly Fries.  Carly Fries.  I like that.  F-R-Y-S.  It's like Carly Fries.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  So we just started talking through there and she was doing comedy and then she had told  me she's a huge Amy Schumer fan.  Yeah.  So I thought, well, you know, if she's on, I said, would you mind doing this on the air? 
[04:01:30]  Doing your standup on the air?  She's like, no, I'll do it.  Was that nerve wracking for you, Carly?  So nerve wracking.  Like it seems, like you say you're.  It's like super intimidating.  Yeah.  Because she's your, is she your favorite comedian?  Yeah.  I'm sorry about that, Jim.  I'm not offended at all.  I understand completely.  Amy's very funny.  She's very funny.  She's so funny.  Yes.  Um, so like you say, like you're so afraid of everything.  That seems like a very outgoing thing to do though.  I mean, I'm, I'm, I feel like when it's doing standup, it's different because I want 
[04:02:00]  to do it and I like doing it.  Yeah.  And I feel like this was a really fun thing and a really great thing to do.  And it was something that was so awesome, a really good opportunity.  So it was definitely really nerve wracking.  Do you get stage fright?  Um, before I go up on stage, I get super nervous.  Uh-huh.  But then once I'm up, it's fine.  You weren't nervous coming in here though?  Or you were?  Oh, I was, I was, I was so nervous.  It seemed like you pulled it off.  Um, how did you feel your performance went?  I feel like I was a little too quiet. 
[04:02:30]  How's it?  Because I was, I was, I was, I was nervous.  So I think I kept out of the banter a little.  Well, how do you, what about when you were doing your minute though?  That was good.  Yeah.  Um, I felt okay about it.  I have some joke.  Cause I was like, all right, let me just think of like a minute's worth of jokes right now.  And I was trying to figure out which one I was going to do.  But I figured I would do that one because I had more like punches to it.  Were you nervous for Carly, Troy?  I was just happy for her, you know, she, uh, and it is weird.  Cause when you're in here with, you know, these guys, I mean, they're, they're professionals. 
[04:03:00]  They have this chemistry.  Well, yeah, that's what I was going to say.  When she was talking about jumping in on the banter, that's like impossible.  Yeah.  And you're trying to wiggle your way into a spot.  And they're so fucking funny.  Right.  Everybody's so funny.  And you're second guessing everything you say, like you're about to jump in with something  that's stupid.  That's dumb.  I shouldn't say.  Yeah.  But how do you think she did?  I think she did good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's, it's a, it's a cool thing that she was willing to come on here and do.  And it's, it's scary.  It's definitely fucking scary.  You've been in here before, you know.  Well, yeah.  I mean, it's, it's, it's really intimidating. 
[04:03:30]  You know, especially, I can't imagine doing standup in front of, in a room like this.  It's one thing.  I can't either.  That's a fucking rough, that's a rough gig.  Yeah.  And the only audience is.  They were so nice to me.  Two, like, experienced professional comedians.  Professionals.  Yeah.  One of whom is your absolute favorite comedian.  Right.  Yeah.  And Anthony, which I don't know if you understand how funny Anthony really is.  Do you know the show?  Yes.  Did you know Troy from the show when he started Instagram talking to you?  No.  Oh, okay.  So you don't know, like, every. 
[04:04:00]  Like, I know now.  You didn't think he was a creep, though, when Troy started talking to you?  Like, hey.  No, like, it was like a, it wasn't like, oh, hey, I'm a creeper.  It was like, hey.  Because he's a creep.  We're just talking about.  No, he's.  Why is everybody acting like Troy's such a creep?  He's so nice.  I'm a little bit of a creep.  You're a creep?  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah.  But he's never been a creep with me.  So I don't know, like, the creepage.  I don't know that creepy side.  Eric.  Talk to me about this.  Because Troy is always very open and honest about how he feels, you know, in terms of  your health and your weight and things like that.  Do you think, do you think that Troy is a creepy dude? 
[04:04:30]  Well, we were all just talking back here once Troy announced that he met her through Instagram.  Everyone just kind of went, oh.  Yeah.  Like, it's obvious.  Everyone just thinks this is a real creepy move.  It's obvious to you guys that Troy is.  The end goal here is to hook up with her.  Well, it wasn't like, oh, Instagram.  Oh, you're talking to me on Instagram.  Right.  And then it was like that.  It was like, my Twitter's connected to my Instagram.  So it's like.  And then he followed me on Twitter.  All I write on Twitter is jokes.  So, and he liked the jokes. 
[04:05:00]  So he liked the jokes.  Yeah.  And then that was.  It wasn't like, oh, hey.  What do you write on Twitter?  Cool.  What?  What do you do on Twitter?  Like, I write jokes.  Like, I post jokes on Twitter.  So he was following me on Twitter and he thought it was funny.  Yeah.  Well, that was the one.  The main thing that I was interested in what she does because.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, dude.  Writing jokes on Twitter is a really hard thing to do.  It's difficult.  I haven't been able to figure out how to do it.  I haven't either.  Mine are terrible.  So when she's able to do stuff that I, you know, I'm scrolling through, you know, tweet  after tweet and I go, oh, that's funny.  Oh, that's funny.  What does the room think, Eric? 
[04:05:30]  What do you guys in the room think?  They're all discussing here about, you know, Instagram led to Twitter.  Twitter's leading to something else if it hasn't already.  What's the consensus?  Consensus?  Wait a minute.  Eric, speak for the room.  I don't even know.  I mean.  Everyone thinks Troy's a creep.  And they think that there's more to this that Troy's not telling.  No, I swear to God.  I swear to God this is the honest guy truth.  Eric, you've known Troy for a long time.  Yeah.  What do you think his intentions are here?  Troy's not a guy to deal with bullshit.  Like, he'll do the dance for a tiny bit, but then he gets straight to the point and say, 
[04:06:00]  look, is this going to happen or not?  Nice whip out my balls.  And you think, do you, but do you think he's making friends?  He just whips out his balls, he said.  Do you think he's making friends here?  Do you think he's looking for somebody to whip out his balls in front of?  Um, I think it's both.  Do you think Troy wants to eat her honey and have her suck his swank?  Oh, God.  Like, she said, like, for instance, on the show today, you said that you don't like to  dirty text.  Like, Troy, would you be willing to teach her how to dirty text and be fun with it? 
[04:06:30]  Nah, I mean, it's fine.  You wouldn't do that.  Well, she doesn't like doing that.  I'm not going to dirty text.  But no, no, no, no, no.  Not dirty text with her.  Like, show her.  Be like, no, if you just do this, it's just fun.  Yeah.  Like, and that way she could do it with somebody else.  Not like with you.  Not like creepy.  Yeah.  Just like, here, let me take you under my wing.  First, you would type something like this.  Here's how we do this.  I would say something like that.  Is that something you would do?  I mean, I guess we'd have to wait and see what happens.  You'd be willing to, though.  I have no idea.  Sure.  No, I get it.  I get it.  He's okay with it.  But you're not a dirty texter.  No. 
[04:07:00]  You never would be?  Or maybe if, or it depends on what.  I feel like all that shit, like, the internet's such a thing now.  Yeah.  And it's, it's so, it could so be blown up.  And you end up meeting, like, weird dude.  He's on the internet a lot of times.  Like, Troy.  I mean, I didn't even actually put two and two together.  I'm so not weird in this situation.  I've been weird.  I've been a total creep.  He thinks it's weird, Troy.  It is.  It's fine.  Well, I mean, I know what your intentions are.  There's no intentions.  No, you're not being open about what your intentions are.  That's why it's creepy.  No, no, no. 
[04:07:30]  There's no intentions.  Okay.  I told you.  I told you what it was.  I said Amy was, isn't my job, part of my job is to create content for the show.  So if she said that she would, she would do her stand up in front of Amy Schumer, it's  like, well, here's your opportunity.  They said, come on the show and do it.  And he knows that Amy's like my, like.  But he also contacted you about being one of the girls who shit on a table.  Well, I just, I just asked if she knew any weird.  No, no, no, no.  He asked me if any of my friends would want to shit on a table.  I thought she may know some weird girls.  This is a classier caliber of broad.  Well, yeah, she may know some weird people.  You're not going to sit there.  Were you hoping she'd drop a deuce on the table, though? 
[04:08:00]  I would be surprised if she did.  I don't know anybody that would, I think that's so.  What's the weirdest place you've ever dropped a deuce?  Like, and then showed somebody, huh?  I've never showed anybody a deuce.  Well, I mean, Troy, I never would.  What do you do on Twitter, though?  What do you do on Twitter?  What do you think I, I, what do you mean what do I do on Twitter?  What do you, do you post, what do you write on Twitter?  I write, like, like, tweets.  Like, I write, like, one-liners.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Jokes?  We have to wrap up, unfortunately. 
[04:08:30]  Why?  He doesn't think I'm funny.  Who doesn't?  Jim, I actually saw laugh twice at your site.  Jim's like, oh, oh, so you write jokes?  You don't post pictures of your deuces?  No, no, it was just funny that you said jokes.  Jokes.  You said jokes?  I'm from Long Island.  I know, it was just jokes.  Listen, Troy, I think you could be very amusing.  Yeah, and I saw Jim laugh a couple times,  and to get at least two laughs in one minute, six months into the game,  it seems like you're pretty far ahead.  And best of luck to you, Troy.  And I hope that you all stay tuned for Ron and Fez. 
[04:09:00]  We'll be back.  Jim's not going to be in tomorrow,  so we'll see what kind of clusterfuck of a show Anthony and the rest of us idiots pull off.  We'll see you then.  Goodbye.  All right.
