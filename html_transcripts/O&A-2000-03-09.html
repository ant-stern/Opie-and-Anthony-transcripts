<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about Spaz's experiences in a gay play, detailing graphic and humorous accounts of unwanted physical contact with a male co-star, including touching and a "nip" to his genitals.  This was followed by a deep dive into their "Most Offensive Song Contest," previewing numerous listener submissions.  Several songs were highlighted, including one using the word "darky" repeatedly, and another, far more controversial, from "Billy and Paul" of airsick.net, containing graphic lyrics about abortion and violence.  This latter song provoked strong reactions from callers, many describing it as the most offensive thing they'd ever heard.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a call-in segment featuring Earl, a station employee, focusing on his perceived lack of sexual activity despite a colleague's alleged offer.  Crude jokes and speculation about Earl's sexuality filled the air, alongside discussions of the colleague's sexual history with other employees.  An interview with Earl from an unofficial website was also read aloud, including a question about "nigger rage." Other callers contributed their opinions and jokes,  while Eric, a studio guest, called in to discuss sexually explicit scenes from an HBO program, focusing on the actresses' appearances and the realism of the depictions.  A Vermont Teddy Bears advertisement was also aired during this segment.

The show continued with the hosts attempting to display a sexually explicit photograph on their studio camera.  Further entries to the "Most Offensive Song Contest" were played, including "Killer Kitten" and another extremely controversial submission that generated widespread listener reaction.  Comedian Lewis Black arrived in the studio, and the show shifted to a conversation between the hosts and Black about New York City, the presidential election (featuring commentary on Al Gore, George W. Bush, and John McCain), and various news items.  Black's comments often provided a counterpoint to the show's more outrageous content.  Numerous calls followed, with listeners reacting to the songs and offering opinions on the presidential candidates and other news stories. One caller described a physical reaction to the offensive songs, while Nicky expressed anger over Vietnam War-related comments, and Eugene called Kathy Lee Gifford a "stupid bitch" and made further disparaging remarks about her and her son. Bill Cosby's alleged misconduct was also discussed. The hosts also promoted Stacker 2 and Rockaway Bedding.  Black's upcoming stand-up performances were promoted as well, along with a continued discussion of the song contest.

A later segment featured a discussion of a lawsuit against Magic Johnson stemming from a tongue kiss, followed by commentary on Daryl Strawberry’s drug problems and born-again Christianity. A caller recounted a story about a man killing a dog after a fender bender, prompting a discussion on Los Angeles traffic.  The "Most Offensive Song Contest" resumed with the playing and judging of "Baby Raper" by "Fuel," a song that, along with previous entries like "Kill a Fetus" and "How Much is That Darky in the Window?", elicited numerous calls, many expressing both shock and amusement. The hosts, callers, and the songwriter himself debated the song's offensiveness and its chances of winning, comparing it to "Kill a Fetus."  Lewis Black's guest appearance continued, discussing his upcoming shows. The segment concluded with further discussion of "Baby Raper's" unexpected popularity, plans for future segments, including a possible live performance by "Fuel" at a road show, and plans to bathe "Smelly Karen" on air.  The broadcast included a rapid-fire, nonsensical exchange between the hosts involving graphic and violent imagery related to pregnancy and abortion, with frequent use of vulgar and offensive language, promoting a "FU Friday" segment and the call-in number 1027 WNEW.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  A gigantic boombox is coming down the street.  Hand me the RPG-7.  Woody and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  I'll be an Anthony.  In my day, radio was boring all the time.  And we liked it that way.  And tell that dirty Sanchez guy to take a bath.  All right, we've got to get Spaz in here.  Yeah, quite frankly, he's going to bore us here. 
[00:00:30]  Hey, boy.  All right, so if you're a faithful listener to the show, Spaz, who we've kept off the radio for a while now, thank God,  he finally completed his gay play run.  How many plays were there?  Five.  Five of this class.  We all remember the first night.  You said, I don't know, you kind of had a scene where you had to lay in the bed with this guy, 
[00:01:00]  and he kind of put his hands through your hair.  And as the lights went dim, he made like he was going south to pleasure.  Yes.  That's the scene.  And you were supposed to be straight in this play, but I was supposed to be confused with your sexuality.  You had one gay experience before this, and now for some reason you're in bed with this gay guy.  Is this the play or his life we're talking about?  I'm confused now. 
[00:01:30]  He's supposed to seduce me in the play.  Right.  And you're in his bed.  Yeah.  No, he's in my bed.  He comes into my room.  Oh.  Oh, how did that come about?  So you have the homo field advantage.  How did that come about?  How did you invite the gay guy back to your room?  I didn't invite him in.  See, the way this scene starts is that I'm in my bed, like, sobbing.  Like, I'm fighting not to cry because of the tragedy of my life.  And he hears that through the partition in the wall.  So he comes in, and he... 
[00:02:00]  Takes a temper to the old-fashioned way.  He tells me down, and he seduces me.  He uses the excuse that I want to, you know, know why I'm...  Yeah, it's every day that I'm in bed, and if someone's knocking at the door, I just let him in and invite him into my bed.  It's a play, you know?  I'm not...  No coffee or anything?  I don't invite him in because it's just like a little thin wall with, like, a little slide door.  He just walks right in.  I don't...  Oh, he just came right in.  He just...  I walk into his room.  What are you at, a bathhouse or something? 
[00:02:30]  Is this supposed to be your apartment?  It's supposed to be...  It was an old house in 1938 in New Orleans.  All right.  And you're just living with gay guys.  No, one is gay.  The other one, if he gets $100, he'll do it.  And you're supposedly this confused guy.  I'm the confused guy.  So now the gay guy's in your bed.  You have to talk about this because I know that a lot of listeners were, like, happy but spaz-free. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, shit.  Shut up.  Okay.  So you're in the bed.  I'm in the bed.  And he's sitting on the bed with you.  Yes.  And now he starts, the actor, starts improvising a little bit on the scene.  Yes, there's a little bit.  Yeah, let's get this straight because basically you all agree that, okay, you'll do this gay scene but there's no touching, right?  Well, there's only one part where...  There's only two parts where he touches me.  One is when he runs his finger down my arm.  Right.  And the other part is when he puts his arm around my shoulders. 
[00:03:30]  And you agreed to that but no more for this play.  Yes.  But the actor starts improvising.  Yes.  All right, spaz, what did the actor do to you during the gay play?  Now, the first couple of nights, he started improvising just a little bit.  Just a little bit.  So what was he doing then?  Well, instead of, like, a finger, he put his whole hand.  And he rubbed down your, where?  He rubbed down my thigh.  So he's rubbing down your thigh. 
[00:04:00]  And then what was he doing?  You said something with, I don't know, what was he doing?  Wasn't he breathing?  Oh, yes, yes.  Like, tickle in there.  He nubbed my ear.  Like, what?  He put his, like, he took my earlobe, like, he held on my earlobe, shook it a little.  What is he, Carol Burnett?  So he grabbed your ear?  He grabbed my earlobe, yes.  So he fingered your ear?  He didn't finger, he just grabbed down the earlobe.  So he had a hold of your ear?  Your ear.  Your ear.  My ear.  Yeah, that's what I said.  Your ear.  Your ear. 
[00:04:30]  So he gently fingered your ear.  Your ear, I said.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your ear.  Your ear.  Right.  My ear.  Your ear.  He had his hand all over your ear.  All over your ear.  Did he poke anything in your ear?  No.  No?  He just grabbed onto it.  He just grabbed your ear.  Yes.  And kind of flitted around with a finger.  But it didn't stick anything in your ear.  Did it sound like my behind?  No, I'm saying your ear.  Your ear.  My ear.  Yeah.  You're from New York. 
[00:05:00]  This is how we talk.  My ear.  Your ear.  My ear.  Your ear.  Yeah.  We said your ear.  He fingered my ear.  He fingered your ear.  Did he finger your ear?  He grabbed onto it.  Right.  Okay.  So, but he shook it with his fingers.  Right?  Yeah.  He kind of played with his fingers on your ear.  Yes.  I'm my ear.  Yeah.  That's what I said.  Your ear.  Yeah.  So, was he blowing into your ear?  No.  He didn't get that far.  Okay.  All right.  Did he tongue your ear? 
[00:05:30]  No.  I got to ask.  No.  He did not tongue anything.  Would you consider what he did to your ear a diddle?  Did he diddle your ear?  It's like, it's like, like, it's like, uh, like saying, like, here's looking at you, kid  type thing.  Would you consider it a diddle?  What do you mean like a diddle?  Did he diddle your ear?  What do you mean by that?  I don't know.  I mean, was it a diddle?  You know what a diddle is?  No, it's kind of like a diddle.  He just grabbed on all of it.  He, like, looked at me dead in the eye.  Wait, so he used two fingers? 
[00:06:00]  He used two fingers.  He looked at me in the eye and he shook it a little bit.  Two fingers on your ear?  Yeah.  Wow, Spaz.  That's all I could say.  Okay.  So that was the first night of improvising.  Yes.  That he did.  So now, uh, the next night, uh, he gets a little more bold with you.  Well, I don't know if this was intentional or not, but, uh, but, uh, there's this part  where, like, where he's supposed to, uh, say, uh, shh, listen to the rain. 
[00:06:30]  And I'm supposed to turn my head away, look out the fake window and look at the rain.  And when he's doing this, he's supposed to say, I'm going to give you this to help you  to sleep.  And he puts his hand underneath the sheets.  And I, I mean, he...  So it's supposed to be, uh, manually doing something.  Yeah.  No, no, he's, no, he's supposed to, yeah, he's supposed to be, like, reaching for it.  Right.  But he...  How are you supposed to hear the rain if he's got a finger in your ear?  No, he just numbs it at the, at the end of the... 
[00:07:00]  All right, so you're listening to the rain.  Yeah, I'm listening to the rain, and he's moving his hand, and he kind of nipped it.  Now, now, wait a minute.  What?  He nipped your, your schlong?  Ah!  Bag!  It was unintentional, I'm thinking.  Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!  I never...  Dude.  What, what do you mean?  No offense, but at that point, you break character.  You break character.  And you punch him in the head.  Yeah.  And you go, come on, man, what are you doing?  I broke character in a different way.  I laughed a little bit.  Oh, you laughed?  Oh, you giggled?  You liked it? 
[00:07:30]  You giggled like a bitch.  Oh, are you giggling like a little schoolgirl?  Giggling like a bitch, man.  No!  No!  No, I laughed...  Bring in my ear.  My ear.  I did not laugh.  No.  This is the way it happened.  You see, because...  I was not expressing it.  I was not expressing it.  Did he touch your unit?  He nipped the tip. 
[00:08:00]  He nipped the tip.  Now, I'm not a fag.  He touched the tip.  No, he just, he's like brushed, nipped it.  He nipped it.  So you even know all the terminology.  Yeah.  No, nothing's teeth.  All right.  And you giggled like a schoolgirl.  I didn't giggle like a schoolgirl.  How did you laugh?  Give us a little laugh.  You broke character.  What'd you do?  No, I didn't like laugh out loud.  I had this smile on my face.  What? 
[00:08:30]  Wait, let me tell you something, Spaz.  Play or no play.  Someone's touching my schlong.  Even if they nip into it, that's not the look that's on my face.  The look on my face.  It's not a big smile.  Right.  But let me just tell you why I had that.  Because I was not expecting it.  Because he has to, this is the type of person that has a tendency to play jokes around it.  Oh, yeah, what a joke.  But the joke's on him because you're not gay, right?  Yeah, sure.  Why don't you add the look of pure shock on your face? 
[00:09:00]  Boy, that's not my, that's how I react to everything.  That's how I react to everything.  That's like my defense against, you know, like.  My defense against everything.  No, uncertainty or like.  He nipped it.  He nipped it.  No, laughing is my defense against something if I'm not so afraid of something.  I can see you on cell block D just giggling your ass off like you're a new boy.  Hey, that's good.  I'm laughing is my defense.  He's tossing my salad. 
[00:09:30]  No, look, I'm tossing salad.  Look at me.  Look, I'm tossing salad.  It would never go that far.  Oh, sure.  So how far would it go if he nipped it?  He nipped.  I was not expecting it.  And things that I get surprised at, I laugh at.  So you laugh.  Yeah.  So now, moving on.  Right.  There was another instance where he is supposed to take his head and move it down towards your 
[00:10:00]  incubate area.  Right.  To simulate that he's having a knob.  Pleasuring.  Yes.  Right.  So at one point, he gets so close.  Now, Spaz, you are wearing nothing but flesh-colored boxer shorts.  Yes.  And what was he wearing?  He was wearing the European underwear with the outline.  European underwear with the outline.  What is that?  You don't know.  It's like, uh, it's, it's underwear with, it's, it's like the, with the outline. 
[00:10:30]  It's a speedo.  No, it's like the shape of your thing, but it goes down to your, like, it acts like a  thumb.  It acts like a speedo, yes.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  But it's underwear.  So.  Yeah, sure.  So, so this guy's obviously gay.  No, he's not.  Please.  He's a respected man.  Well.  Wait.  So now you're just.  Look, he's defending his boyfriend.  No, because.  Wait.  So are you trying to say that gay people aren't respected?  No.  No, I'm saying, Spaz.  I'm saying this like.  You're one of them.  You shouldn't put him down. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  I'm not one of them.  No, what I'm saying is I cannot.  I'm not making any accusations against anybody because he's a good friend of mine.  I asked if he was gay and you said no because he's a respected man.  Yeah, I meant no.  I'm not going to make that accusation.  Implying that gay people aren't respected.  I'm not going to make that accusation.  You just did.  We have a lot of everything around.  We have a lot of.  It's not an accusation.  We have a lot of gay listeners.  They're going to be pissed off at you.  I already said that I could be friends with a gay person.  Oh, gee.  You pretty much batted down with one.  I hope you could be friends.  He's not gay, though. 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  Don't do the gay community a favor or anything.  Oh, come on.  I could be friends with a lot.  Don't do it.  Yeah, sure.  Well, gee, thanks.  So, Spaz, now you're wearing your boxer shorts.  Mm-hmm.  And he's wearing his European little bathing suit or whatever.  Yeah.  Now, I guess the front of the boxers has the normal hole in it.  Yes.  Yeah.  So, as he does his little move where he moves south, he gets so close, what do you feel? 
[00:12:00]  Breath.  You feel hot, steamy man breath.  Breath on your unit.  There's a reason for that?  There's a reason for that.  The reason for that is that that particular night, that particular night, the lights were  coming down really slow.  Yeah.  Fake.  So, he has to stretch the scene.  No, what he has to do, he has to hold his position there.  Yeah, hold his position.  Oh. 
[00:12:30]  So, how does man breath on your penis feel?  Yeah.  How does that feel?  Hot, steamy man breath.  It feels weird.  And what about razor stuff?  What, do you think I liked it?  Not once did I get excited.  So, you laughed again, though, right?  That, no, that.  Man breath.  No, I'm kidding.  Man breath.  No, that.  Man breath.  No.  No.  No, bitch laugh.  I do not laugh like that, all right? 
[00:13:00]  I'm a man who laugh.  I need to be told something funny.  This stuff isn't funny?  What, are you crazy?  No, but at that particular time, I had a look of confusion on my face because I was looking  in the direction of the lighting person.  Looking erection, what?  Oh, oh, looking in the direction.  Oh, direction.  All right, so let me get this straight.  That's French for erection.  You had a look of confusion.  Direction.  Because you were looking at the lighting director.  Yep.  And that's why you were confused?  It wasn't because there was man breath on your penis?  No, I was confused at two things.  One is, no, actually, because the slow lighting led to the man breath. 
[00:13:30]  Hot, steamy man breath.  One nine hundred calls.  But like I said, it probably was purely unintentional.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, he couldn't just get far enough away.  No, because look, because he had a simulator, so he had to put the blanket up and he had his  face like right there.  Was his head moving?  What?  Was his head moving?  No, not at all.  Did you have your hand on the back of his head?  No, I was, no, because, no, because he has to tell me to lean back and imagine the 
[00:14:00]  paratroopers, so I have to lean back.  What?  Paratrooper.  Yeah, the paratrooper is, paratrooper was the person I had a relationship with a long  time ago.  Ooh, Geronimo.  Yeah.  Pooper trooper?  Pull my cord.  Yeah.  Oh, Spaz, man.  You couldn't find a production of Oklahoma?  Oklahoma. 
[00:14:30]  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Opie.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Anthony.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of poets.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  Ah, that's right.  It's the Opie show today.  Screw Anthony, I don't need him anymore.  Where the hell is Anthony?  He's checking his stocks, isn't he? 
[00:15:00]  That bastard.  All right, screw Ant, we're going solo today.  Here he comes.  Loser!  This guy's too small.  You said two songs.  I don't need you anymore.  You said two.  I don't need you.  Oh, man.  I will not be doing a radio show with you anymore.  I thought that was the first song, Opie. 
[00:15:30]  That was the second.  Bush was the first.  Oh.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Eric.  Glad I could make it.  Let's make believe we haven't talked to each other for the last three hours.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had to turn Anthony on to the lesbian stuff from HBO.  Yeah, we were watching that in the office.  If these walls could talk.  If this gash could talk.  Yeah.  What did they replay last night on HBO?  We got a tape. 
[00:16:00]  And I had to turn my buddy Anthony on to it.  Finally.  You know, I heard a bunch of people talking about it.  And I hadn't seen it.  So now I finally saw it.  Oh, my God.  There was problems with the matching of the lesbians, right?  Yeah.  Definitely.  You needed Michelle Williams with Sharon Stone.  Right.  That would have been a hot lesbo scene.  But instead, you get, I don't know, Ellen DeGeneres with Sharon Stone.  We're trying to figure out if that's Ellen DeGeneres' boob. 
[00:16:30]  I think it is.  You really think that's her boob?  I think it was.  They were quick shots.  And they were one of her laying on her back.  So that was kind of weird.  Mm-hmm.  You know, you can't really tell firmness or anything by laying on their back.  Well, it looked like a little pancake.  And then one where she was kind of bending over Sharon Stone, like hunched over her.  And it was just hanging down.  Hanging side boob.  Yeah.  And it didn't look bad there.  I don't know. 
[00:17:00]  It's amazing, though.  I saw everything that everybody watched that show for.  And it took about a minute and a half.  Oh, yeah.  The whole show?  How long was it?  I think each vignette.  I think they're called vignettes.  We're vignettes.  20, 25 minutes long.  Huh.  Yeah.  So you're talking a show, what, an hour-long show?  Well, we got the tape and we just went to the lesbian scenes.  That's all we did.  And we didn't do the lesbian scene in the first one because I'll get old lesbos.  I guess it was two old lesbo broads. 
[00:17:30]  We had no desire to check out that lesbian scene.  Jeez.  Even I did not want to see that, Anthony.  No.  You proud of me?  Yeah, I know.  Thank God.  Rick's like, oh, there's the old lesbos.  At the beginning, I was like, nah.  No, thank you.  But what man?  Some of those scenes, pretty hot.  And then the other one they had, with what's her name there from Dawson's Creek?  Michelle Williams and Chloe or whatever her name is.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  One is a man. 
[00:18:00]  I know.  There's nothing worse than seeing a lesbian scene where one of the lesbos looks like a man.  It was ridiculous.  But that Michelle Williams, that's not bad.  Yeah.  She was always her first lesbo experience, I guess.  That was on the bed.  She's getting her clothes peeled off.  She's giggling.  That was hot.  She opens up this, pulls the shirt up.  Yeah.  She's all timid and stuff.  And the other girl just nails her hands down. 
[00:18:30]  She pulls her hand against the bed, the headboard of the bed.  And she cups the right one a little bit.  And then the one hand goes right down, beef, to play What's in My Pants, squirming.  That was pretty hot.  That scene was pretty much like the scenes we've been seeing in the studio.  On the lesbian couch.  I want to be a lesbian for a day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  On the lesbo couch.  For sure.  So what did you think?  What you saw, you liked, right?  You didn't have to sit through the bullcrap storylines. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  I thought they were pretty hot lesbo scenes.  But they didn't have that glazed donut look when they were done.  They were basking in the afterglow.  And they were both completely dry.  Yeah.  All of them.  You know.  Come on.  At least a little bit.  Somewhere.  Eric, what's going on?  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Feeling.  Yo, the billboards don't go out in the thing last night.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Well, we didn't even want to, like, you know, fast forward through it to see. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  We just assumed they were having, like, old, broad lesbo sex.  Oh.  And we didn't want to go there.  What does that look like?  Yeah, definitely not, man.  It's like bumping cow tongues.  It's like any other.  It's like.  It's like any other clams.  Yo, guys.  Yeah.  Like any other clams, though, Opie.  You don't want the old ones.  You know?  You want the newer, tighter ones.  The young, supple lesbo seats.  The older clams, if you find you open them up, they're a little stinky, a little gamey. 
[00:20:00]  The color's a little off.  The color's a little off.  Could be a little chewy.  And in the long run, it could make you sick.  Okay.  It's perfect.  Very good.  All right, sir.  Guys.  Yeah.  Am I getting an inappropriate bill?  Uh, you got to do something.  Yeah, we're going to have some contests for those damn things today.  All right.  All right.  We'll do that a little later.  All right.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Peace.  Peace.  Let's go to Bob.  Bob.  Bob.  What's up, Bob?  What's up?  I saw Michelle Williams in an off-ballway play down here called Killer Joe. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah?  And she did a totally nude scene.  Get out of town.  And you can tell that the entire audience just went there because she was doing a nude  scene.  Just to see her naked.  Yeah, she's got one of those hot bodies, man.  Yeah, because when the scene came up, you could hear a pin drop and everybody leaning  forward in their chairs.  You heard the whole audience like, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee.  Everybody just wanted to see how it was a bunch of lechers.  Yeah, they sat straight up to check it out. 
[00:21:00]  And they had to hire a guy for the theater, too, to squeegee the floors when they were done.  Yeah, she was born to be naked, definitely.  Born to be naked.  Good line, Rick.  Thank you.  Born to be naked.  I like that.  We're going to use that one on the show.  We're going to ask girls if they were born to be naked.  Born to be naked.  Thank you, Bob.  Okay.  All right, peace.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, you're next on N.E.W.  Oh, Pete.  I see we've fixed the phones.  Yeah, what's up, Mike? 
[00:21:30]  What's going on?  Not much.  Listen, watch at the end of that.  It's got stand-ins for those two.  It ain't her boob.  It looked like her face in that scene where she's on her back.  Yeah.  That was all Sharon Stone, though.  You could tell.  No, that was.  I have to say yes.  But at the end of the credits, it has something that says stand-in for those two.  Oh, really?  I don't think that was all Ellen DeGeneres.  No way.  I don't think so. 
[00:22:00]  I don't think she looks that good naked.  No, dude, you're getting confused because a stand-in is someone that they have working  there on the set that stands or, you know, takes the position of the actor while they  get the lighting all set.  A body double is somebody who takes the place of the actor during the scene.  Yeah, but they wouldn't write body double even if it was because they wouldn't want to  screw with that whole thing.  And they usually don't credit the body double.  Yeah, they want everyone to think that was Ellen's boob.  That was like a stunt boob.  Stunt boob.  Stunt boob for Ellen DeGeneres, I believe. 
[00:22:30]  Stunt boob played by Buddy Joe Hooker.  Remember him?  He was the stunt man in everything.  Like in Smokey and the Bandit.  Smokey and the Bandit.  Stunt man.  Buddy Joe Hooker.  All right, listen, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Syndication now and forever.  Thank you, Mike.  Take it easy.  All right, we've got to take a quick break, Anthony.  We're just getting started here today, of course.  We've got a couple new entries for the most offensive song, and I don't even know if we 
[00:23:00]  can play them on the radio.  Why?  They are so bad.  There's a couple really bad ones, man.  I heard the one, I don't want to even say the title.  We don't want to ruin it.  What the hell is that doing on me again?  The studio cam?  We need broads to come down for the studio cam.  Studio cam should be fun stuff.  Not us.  Just us.  Who cares?  All right, well, we do have a couple more entries into the most offensive song contest, 
[00:23:30]  Anthony, and they are definitely over the top.  Just from the titles, I say contenders.  They're very good.  Definite contenders.  We're going to play those later on in the show, and a lot of people are asking how they  get their entry in for the most offensive song.  Very, very easy.  Get a song in to us.  Less than three minutes would be appreciated.  Make sure we can understand your lyrics, write about whatever the hell you want, and send  it in to WNW, okay?  We have the address here if you want to call Spaz up.  All right?  Right.  212-757-1027. 
[00:24:00]  Quick break.  We'll be back.  Opie's, you scum.  And Anthony.  Your new name is Dick.  Opie and Anthony.  What changed you into such demonic little bastard?  1027-wnew.  You guys have the stereo rated because it's beyond belief right now.  Opie and Anthony show.  There it is.  1027-wnew.  That's my favorite sweeper by that guy. 
[00:24:30]  That's like a guy that's just finally given up and realized that we're here to stay.  Yeah.  That's the guy that probably a year ago was hoping, you know, we'd get fired and he was all excited.  Yeah, it didn't happen.  Now, just like all the other critics out there, they're all giving up going,  and they are going to stick around for a while.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  How did it happen? 
[00:25:00]  You're supposed to be fired.  I don't understand.  Fine.  We're up to a year and nine months.  Remember when everyone in this damn market said Opie and Anthony will last three months?  Three months.  And then we're gone.  Gone.  See ya.  And then they were convinced the old N.E.W. would stay forever  and that the Opie and Anthony show was a stupid, stupid experiment.  Remember that, Ed?  Yeah.  Don't worry.  You'll be back to music, and you two asses will be gone. 
[00:25:30]  You guys are being like Tulsa.  All right.  Well, we're still here.  Oops.  We pretty much outlasted everybody at this station.  Sorry.  We've been here the longest.  You know that, right?  Yeah, we're the veterans.  There's only like two people on this floor that have been here longer than us.  Who?  Andrea.  Yeah.  Who does the music for the show.  And Jimmy.  Right.  Who puts together our production and does a great job at that. 
[00:26:00]  They're the only two that have been here longer than us at this point.  Wow.  Cleaned house.  Oh, and Earl.  Earl.  Yeah, but Earl doesn't really work.  Earl.  We're talking about people that work.  Earl.  Yeah.  So it continues, and now we have a bunch of new shows and fun stuff going on. 
[00:26:30]  Yep.  And that ride out big.  That's right.  I hear Ron and Fez are talking about what we've been talking about.  Yeah, I guess they're getting a few emails about Fez and his wacky voice.  Yeah.  You know, but people are tuning in, man.  Yeah.  I was listening.  They were reading some emails from listeners.  I was dying laughing last night, man.  Like Ron is talking about some of the emails coming in about Fez's voice.  And Fez is like,  Every time.  What?  Why?  Every module we go to, they say the same questions. 
[00:27:00]  You're going to get a pump upside the head.  I don't understand it.  And then they read a letter from some guy that was calling him a Fogget.  Like he couldn't spell, I guess.  Calling him a Fogget.  Fogget?  What's a Fogget?  I was dying, though.  Really funny.  There's a chick that used to work with Earl here at EW.  Christina.  Hi.  Is this the Christina? 
[00:27:30]  Were you here when we got hired?  You might have been.  I might, yeah.  No.  No.  We've been here a year and nine months.  Oh, no.  You used to work here at EW?  Yeah, I worked there for about four years.  And Earl was there when I worked there.  And what do you have to say?  He was just, he didn't do anything then.  I mean, I loved him.  I loved him.  I loved him with all my heart.  He was a great guy.  But he was, you know, he was a fatsy.  Oh, no.  He was a fatsy.  Oh, no.  No.  Earl does a lot for this place. 
[00:28:00]  He used to walk around in all black with, like, pounds of stuff in his front pocket.  So they gorged out.  Still does.  He still does.  And he was proud of being a virgin.  Still is.  Still is.  We're trying to get a hooker to bang Earl.  Oh, it didn't work back then.  I offered back then.  Whoa, you offered to bang Earl?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Why didn't he accept?  Because I think he was too shy.  I think Earl's gay.  No, no.  We used to kiss on the lips all the time. 
[00:28:30]  Wait, Earl's on the line.  Earl obviously taking time out of his busy work schedule to call our radio show.  Hi, Earl.  Hello, guys.  Look, he's so lazy, he doesn't even walk down the hall.  Oh, wait, Earl, are you on the floor right now?  He's like, you feel like right down the hall?  He's 40 feet away.  Earl.  This is how lazy the guy is.  He doesn't even walk to the studio anymore to be on our show.  He has to call it in.  Oh, Jesus.  So now this girl offered to have sex with you, Earl?  Oh, Christina?  Yeah.  She's married.  Well, I wasn't then.  She wasn't at the time, and she offered to have sex, and what did Earl say? 
[00:29:00]  He said no.  Why?  Why?  Because her fiancée, the cop, might have had something to say about it.  But I wasn't even engaged then, Earl.  She wasn't even engaged.  Yes, she was.  No, I wasn't.  Oh, my God, Earl.  Earl, Earl, what is wrong with you?  Well, you used to kiss on the lips and stuff.  What, like make-out kisses?  Oh, deep, soft.  You guys used to make out?  No.  Oh, Earl.  Oh, my God. 
[00:29:30]  What is going on here?  And she gave great shoulder rubs.  Oh, Matt.  Matt Devote.  Hi, sweetie pie.  Hey, Christina, were you like the station whores?  Yeah.  Close to it.  Close to it.  At least you're honest.  You want your job back?  No.  I don't pay me.  Yeah, we'll trade Earl for you.  No way.  I wouldn't go back there if you paid me like $1,000.  No, it's a lot different than it used to be.  The place is now.  It's impossible.  The place is much better.  Believe me, you're hearing it from us.  It's completely different. 
[00:30:00]  You hear the echo down the hallway.  No.  No.  Not anymore.  There's life.  Believe me, we would agree with you, and we did for about a year and a half.  It was sad.  But it's not, I know, we walked in here like that a couple of years ago, and we were ready  to shoot ourselves.  It was depressing just walking the hallways, but now there's the action.  Yeah, right.  Things are happening.  I was there when the rough Jim Buff was there, Ian O'Malley was there, Jim Monahan was there,  Matt Devote.  It was like nonstop men.  Wow.  More Johnson than you could handle, I bet.  It was awesome.  It was great. 
[00:30:30]  How many guys did you have sex with here in this?  You don't have to say who, but how many?  Yeah.  Oh.  Three.  Three?  Three of the people at any W?  Yeah.  How many?  Well, not being one of them.  Well, not being one of them.  And how many knobs did you have?  Oh, jeez.  Two.  Two.  Wow.  They all go back.  Oh, Salomeo. 
[00:31:00]  That was great, Jim.  Hey, uh, what do you look like?  That's girl.  Earl won't give me an honest opinion.  I know he won't.  Here comes Earl.  Put the studio cam.  Earl, what does this girl look like?  Put the studio cam on Earl.  Oh, it's not up?  Oh, that sucks.  Earl, what does this chick look like?  Oh, she's cute.  Yeah?  Cute.  You're adorable.  What am I, a puppy?  Cute doesn't tell me anything. 
[00:31:30]  Give me a description.  I need height.  I need weight.  I need hair color.  I need breast size.  Uh, brown hair.  Good.  Huge cans.  Thank you.  Uh, she was into Earl, a black man.  I'm guessing huge ass.  Oh.  Right?  No.  Earl?  Earl, how big is her ass?  Big booty?  Baby got back?  No, it wasn't that big.  Don't diss me, Earl.  It wasn't that big.  It wasn't that big.  Earl, thank you.  How big? 
[00:32:00]  Give me a height weight right now.  Right now?  Yeah.  5'5", 140.  All right.  And back then?  5'5", 125.  I don't know.  I like big foot.  I like big foot.  Big foot.  I like big foot.  I like big foot.  I like big foot.  Oh, come on.  So, Earl, why wouldn't you do this stuff? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, why didn't you have sex with her?  I didn't really have to miss this.  You're kissing her and stuff.  Wow.  I wasn't engaged then either, Earl.  Yes, you were.  Why did you want Earl so bad?  She was engaged, all right.  She was engaged in sex with everybody here at the station.  No, I wasn't.  Why the hell didn't you, uh...  I was very choosy.  Oh, sure you were.  I was.  Choosy.  I was.  No, floozy.  Bloozy.  Maybe.  I don't know about choosy.  That's very choosy. 
[00:33:00]  You needed a penis.  Very choosy.  I held a mirror in front of the mouth.  If it fogged, we were going to town.  Oh, man.  That's very choosy.  You guys kill me.  If you have a pulse, I'll do you.  No.  Now, that's desperate.  I don't resemble that.  What?  If that's her?  All right.  So, where the hell did this come from?  What is that?  Where did this come from?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  It's a chick that just, like, gave a hummer, and she's got that glazed donut look on her face. 
[00:33:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  It was taken right after the money shot.  Yeah.  It was taken right after the money shot.  Yeah, exactly.  You're okay.  All right.  Looks like she has a runny nose.  Yeah, she needs some NyQuil.  So, when did you leave this fine establishment?  I guess it was, like, 93 or 94.  Yeah.  Now, why did you want Earl?  We're shocked that anyone wants Earl. 
[00:34:00]  He wanted to cure his virginity.  Kind of.  That's what I'm guessing, right?  Probably.  Did you want that Louisiana black snake?  No, we could never tell what he had.  His pockets were always so full of garbage.  You could never tell.  That wasn't garbage, baby.  Yeah.  That was junk.  But you checked out every guy's package here at N.E.W.?  Well, yeah.  I mean, most of them wore really tight jeans.  Ian O'Malley wore tight jeans.  Sal DeLeo wore tight jeans.  All right.  Are these the guys she's had sex with?  Are they?  No, no, no, no, no.  Okay.  They just were all, you know.  You want to fess up? 
[00:34:30]  Were they on air, any of the guys you had sex with?  No.  No?  All behind the scenes?  Yeah.  Oh, interesting.  And Earl, why wouldn't you go for the banging?  Just do.  Oh, stop it.  Oh, my.  Why?  Why not, Earl?  Fine.  She sounds like somebody who was, you know, it wasn't just a quick pick up off the street  where you didn't know what you were getting.  Come on, I knew what I was.  A working relationship, and she was offering.  Hey, Earl, do you like man-ass?  Yeah, Earl, you've got to be honest. 
[00:35:00]  Do you like cranky man-ass?  Earl likes cranky ass after someone pops a nugget.  This girl sounds like she'd be a lot of fun to bang.  She had everything Earl wants, except a penis.  Did you just have sex, like, on the job and stuff, Christina?  No, no.  Not on the job.  Plus job.  Where did you have sex?  In this office.  You tell us.  You're not even in the same place.  You're not even in the same place.  I know, but, like, did you have, like, sex in, like, you know, the boss's office, in the studio? 
[00:35:30]  No, no, no, no.  It was hard to believe.  There was a meeting room.  There was that, like, lounge area.  A meeting room?  Earl, do you remember that?  Earl, yeah, you remember that?  Do you remember that big room with all the couch?  Remember where you didn't have sex with him?  Well, what happened?  In the old place, there used to be two radio stations, AM and FM, and they moved out,  and there was all this space in the back.  All right.  Can I, can I, I've got to make an announcement about Earl.  The truth is, Earl's a kid toucher.  And, and she was, she was past puberty, and Earl just isn't turned on by anything like hair. 
[00:36:00]  Earl, let us get you a hooker.  You have nasty things on your body, like hair and breasts.  Can we, Earl, can we get you a, can we get, can we get a girl to hob your knob today?  It would make everyone happy around here.  Let's get someone to hob your knob today.  No one's going to come down and hob Earl's knob.  Why not?  Unless his name is Bill or Bob. 
[00:36:30]  All right, I have to go back to work.  What?  What?  I have to go back to work.  All right, Christina.  All right.  All right.  Bye, Earl.  Bye, Christine.  Bye, Matthew.  She's got to get back to a penis, I guess.  All right, Earl, she's gone.  Was she the station slut?  Give it to us.  Give it to us.  Stop being polite.  Was she the station slut?  Honestly, I don't know. 
[00:37:00]  Sounds like you're the only guy she didn't do.  How long was she with this company?  I think almost two years.  Two years.  You know, you hear things, but I don't believe it.  Hey, Earl.  Black Earl was interviewed on the unofficial website.  Right.  I guess from time to time, Steve and the gang at www.foundrymusic.com  interviewed someone associated with the radio show, Anthony.  Yeah.  And this week, it's 13 questions with Black Earl. 
[00:37:30]  What, what, what?  Sorry.  First of all, this chick with the facial picture, I can't stop looking at it.  She looks like she's hammered off her guard.  I swear she doesn't look of age.  I was sent into the chick.  Oh, it was?  The radio chick show?  Where's the radio chick?  She didn't want to look at it.  She didn't want to look at it?  What's wrong with her?  Get her down here. 
[00:38:00]  That's a perfect shot.  Why aren't women sending us pictures like that?  Was she looking for, this was sent to the chick, was she looking for pictures of, uh...  Her boyfriend sent a picture in.  Yeah.  And, uh, and the rest is history on the face.  That's classic.  It looks like she has a really bad runny nose.  It looks like she got punched in the eye, too, right before the, maybe there was something.  Check it out.  Look at her eyes, dude.  That's great.  That's great.  This girl's on smack. 
[00:38:30]  I don't know what she's on.  All right.  She ain't on her.  I think she got hit in the eye by the Loch Ness Monster.  Anyway, uh, Steve and the gang from the unofficial Opie and Anthony website, 13 questions with Black Earl.  You can check out some of the questions for yourself.  Yeah.  Should I just read the number eight?  All right.  This is number eight, one of the questions they asked Black Earl and his answer for everyone to see on the unofficial Opie and Anthony website, okay?  All right.  Question eight reads, it sometimes seems as if the crew gives you a hard time. 
[00:39:00]  Do you think, if given the proper opportunity and motivation, that you could focus your nigger rage on one or several of them so as to tear their still-beating hearts from their chest?  If so, who would feel your wrath?  Okay.  Fair question.  Fair.  The answer?  Oh, wait a minute.  They didn't change my answer.  They didn't change your answer.  Why would they do that, Earl?  Nigger rage, are you kidding?  If anyone has a right to be filled with rage, it's the guys I work with every day. 
[00:39:30]  Do you have any idea how much crap I get away with daily?  I arrive late on a regular basis and blame it on the train.  I make personal phone calls all day.  I wander the hallways while scratching my head and bother other people at their desks.  I hang around the studio trying to get on everyone's show.  And I call all the record and book companies requesting tons of free product under the ruse that I'm somebody important here.  What a racket.  Wait a minute.  I did not write that.  Oh, my God. 
[00:40:00]  It's in an interview.  It's got to be true.  I did not write that.  Okay.  Terrific.  No, I did not.  No, I did not.  Now I'm upset.  I did not write that.  Uh-oh.  Is there any other questions you want me to read?  Earl, I'm just reading what's on the website.  I didn't write that.  No, I did not.  I swear to God, I'm going to hit somebody. 
[00:40:30]  I knew Psychobark would run out of the studio.  That's a good one.  That's pretty funny.  Are there any others worth reading here?  Number which one?  Okay.  Oh, Jesus.  Palomino.  All right.  This one's good?  Oh, man.  Which will go down in your memories as a fonder radio experience,  working with Opie and Anthony or with Scott Muni?  Because Earl did work for Scott Muni for many years.  I would say it's got to be Scott. 
[00:41:00]  And before I read this answer, I have no clue what it's going to say.  I do have to say we really like Scott.  Tough question, Earl writes.  It's really hard to compare the two shows.  Working for Scott was a blast.  He taught me a lot, not only about radio, but about life.  Opie and Anthony really taught me how to lighten up, and that radio should be fun.  Not many people can say that they've worked with Scott Muni and Opie and Anthony.  I'm a very lucky guy.  Wow.  Did you write that one, Earl?  Yes, I did.  Okay.  So if you wrote that one, you must have wrote the other one.  No, I didn't write the other one. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, man.  I swear to God, I didn't write the other one.  All right.  Well, very good.  If you want to read the rest of the questions from the Black Earl interview,  it's on the foundrymusic.com website.  Well, I guess it's my time to say, Earl, isn't it?  Insightful, concise interviews.  And Earl, I appreciate you walking down the hall.  That was very nice.  Thank you.  Instead of calling us on the phone.  It's my turn to Darryl.  I'll just phoning in his moment. 
[00:42:00]  Hey, Kevin, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, Opie and Anthony?  Talking to Earl.  What's up with you?  Oh, Earl is totally gay, man.  Yeah?  Why?  Totally.  Because why wouldn't you bang her?  Yeah, why wouldn't you?  Especially if he's a virgin.  Why wouldn't you bang her?  It sounds like she really likes to give, you know, the oral and stuff,  and she did everyone else.  Why not you, Earl?  You don't have a commitment, nothing.  Why didn't you bang her?  I guess it.  I mean, she was...  She was... 
[00:42:30]  She said she wasn't engaged.  She was engaged at the time.  She was...  She was engaged.  No, she was engaged at the time.  Was she attractive?  She was very attractive.  Damn, you got to go there, man.  And I was good friends with her, I believe, her still husband.  Oh, is she the girl that came by, like, recently that you introduced me to?  No.  It's not the same one?  No.  Not the same, Christine?  Earl has a lot of girls that hang around him, but none of them bang him.  Could we get you a banging, Earl?  Yeah.  Could we get you a girl to hob your knobs? 
[00:43:00]  Yes or no?  Scott's up.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's up?  I just wanted to say that I don't believe that Earl is gay.  One day, Earl and I were sniffing deceit in which John Lennon sat in, and I attempted  to reach around and give him a dirty sanction.  He wouldn't allow me to do so. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, cut it out.  But, uh...  Earl, did you bang Scott's out?  No, I didn't.  No, no, no.  No?  And I have a message from a friend of yours, Hope.  Yeah.  He says to say to you, hiya, dopey.  What?  It's the hiya, dopey guy.  Oh, all right.  All right, Earl.  He actually loves the show.  Oh, my God.  It's my time to begin, I guess.  Doug on line eight has something to say to you.  Doug, what's going on?  What's going on, guys? 
[00:44:00]  How are you?  What's going on with this guy?  He's a fruit puppet.  A fruit puppet.  He could get laid in a woman's prison with a handful of pardons.  What's the matter with you?  You had a girl coming on to you, and you don't want to give him that Louisiana black snake.  Yeah, it sounds like the girl was wild, too, Earl.  I think you have to go for that once.  Yeah.  What's the matter with you with that Louisiana black snake?  Hey, I got a good idea.  I heard you don't know how to hang pictures.  You know where you go learn how to hang pictures?  Watson's a good place for you to go hang things.  They're out of Ku Klux Klan.  They'll teach you how to hang things.  Oh, come on. 
[00:44:30]  That old gag.  John, what's going on?  Nothing much.  Hey.  I think I know why Earl didn't play with her.  Why?  Well, he's saying her boyfriend was going to get pissed.  Right.  I think his boyfriend was going to be mortified.  That's pretty good.  Very good, John.  Thanks.  You guys hope.  All right, man.  All right.  Earl, you're getting a bad rap here, man.  Well, Earl, I'm sure you have a very busy day planned.  Probably have a lot of things to do before 5 o'clock.  What are you going to do now? 
[00:45:00]  Going down the hall, what can we expect from Earl today?  I'm going to write the public file.  Okay.  Very good.  Write like W-R-I-T-E or write it, R-I-G-H-T.  Which thing?  I'm going to write it.  Write the public file.  Okay.  Write it.  All right.  The public file.  What's that?  I don't know.  No, every station is required to have a public file.  Right.  I'm ready.  All right.  All right, Earl.  Thank you.  Punching up any porn on the computers or anything? 
[00:45:30]  No?  No?  Is that true that that happened?  I heard some stories.  What?  Mark bookmarked the freaking gay porno status.  Earl, I wasn't even going to say that.  I walk into work.  I find one of my computer.  There's a gay porn site.  Oh, what a coincidence.  Dude, it was already on there.  What are you talking about?  I just happened to be flipping through and it was just there. 
[00:46:00]  Did you get in trouble once, Earl, for having porno on your computer?  They asked me, and I said, I had no idea.  I swear to God.  I heard this story that, like, I had porno.  Wait, what's the story?  It used to me.  That, like, his computer was loaded up with porno.  First thing in the porno.  And your aunt, what happened?  Who does the computer, tells us not to shut off the computers.  I left mine on.  I come in the next morning, and I think it was mad. 
[00:46:30]  He's like, are you even porno on the computer?  I'm like, no.  He goes, well, we came in, and there's a whole thing on the screen.  You know, like, news to me.  I heard, like, the hard drive was packed.  Like, porno.  Oh, my God.  You've got to delete those files, people.  That's classic.  And then they gave you, like, some type of warning or something?  No, I said, I told the truth.  I went, I know nothing about that. 
[00:47:00]  And they just said, keep the porno off the company computers.  It's just like, I'll keep it on, because I don't put it on.  Oh, sure.  Okay.  We believe you.  All right.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break, Anthony.  Okay.  We're all going to go back and look at Earl's computer for some porno.  Cool.  I heard there's some kiddie porn on there, too.  Oh, my God.  We should get a list of all the websites that Earl's been to lately.  That could be pretty fun. 
[00:47:30]  And, uh, hey.  Gary Putter in the studio.  Hey.  All right.  Okay.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  And we'll be back.  Stay there.  Opie.  Keep your hands.  Always be a pant.  Ah.  Too late.  And Anthony.  I'm just a flaming fan.  A little more stupidity on the way.  102.7 WNW.  Anthony, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Yes, we love them.  Back advertising with our radio show.  We appreciate it, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you very much. 
[00:48:00]  What do they have for us now?  Ah, well, St. Patrick's Day is next week, Anthony.  Yeah.  And you can surprise someone with a Bear Graham gift from the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.

I didn't understand that at first.  I really wasn't paying attention.  I heard air hole.  Air hole in the box.

Anthony, lots of instant feedback coming in about our buddy, our pal, Black Earl.  Yeah.  Richie from Westchester.  The reason Earl wears black all the time is because he is in constant mourning of his  dead penis.  Oh, okay, that's pretty funny.  Frank from Manhattan writes, because we were talking to that girl that wanted to bang Earl 
[00:50:00]  when she used to work here, and Earl liked to deny her.  Yeah.  Frank writes from Manhattan, if she wears a strap on, would Earl bang her?  And Rob from Jersey.  Okay, guys, get off Earl.  Scott Muni just did.  Oh!  Not very funny.  A couple more coming in here.  Yeah.  Michelle writes, why is Earl still a virgin?  I looked him up on the studio cam, and he's not that bad.  He has to be gay. 
[00:50:30]  Wow, look at that.  Rich from Jersey.  Is there any truth to the rumor that Earl and Spaz are doing a man-man porno called bungle  fever?  Bungle fever.  Ouch, babe.  Speaking of bungle fever, Anthony.  Yeah.  I don't know.  What do you want to do?  We have a bunch of people sending in songs for the most offensive song ever.  Yes.  We are looking for the most offensive song ever written, and the entries are really getting  out there.  Really bad. 
[00:51:00]  There's one we're going to play later that's going to outrage a ton of people, I believe.  I think both of them that we're probably going to play today.  We're going to play two today.  They're very offensive.  I don't know.  They will upset a lot of people.  This next song will upset a lot of people, but we are trying to find the most offensive  song.  So how do we handle this, Anthony?  How do we handle it?  I think that's how we handle it.  The topic is, write the most offensive song and send it into the show.  We'll play it.  We say beforehand, the views expressed in these songs are not necessarily those of Opie 
[00:51:30]  and Anthony's show or WNEW radio.  That's the first time we ever said that.  That's how bad these songs are, though.  But God damn, they're funny.  No, that's the whole goal of this thing.  Yeah.  Is send in the most offensive song.  So obviously you have to top the last one.  Wait a minute.  I'm trying to listen to you, but through the reflection behind you, I can see the picture 
[00:52:00]  is up on your board there of the girl.  Oh, yeah.  That just got the facial.  I put her up on my board here with all the show ideas and whatnot that we have to do  today.  You're getting inspiration or something over there?  I mean, there's a picture of a girl that looks like she has a really bad runny nose,  but it's a picture taken right after the money shot.  It kind of looks like she got too close to the hose when someone turned it on.  It looks like somebody, you know what it looks like?  It looks like she was dipping into the strudel icing before it got put on the cake. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, it sure does, man.  Anyway.  Oh, my God.  Horrible explosion at the Elmer's Glue Factory leaves one injured.  That's a great shot.  We should put that picture up on the unofficial website and have people just make captions.  The eye half shot on the one side is great, too.  God, I love it. 
[00:53:00]  Hold it in front of the instant feedback.  In front of the camera, studio cam.  Is the studio cam even working today?  I heard it was.  Get up on your thing, man.  All right, hold on.  We'll try to put the picture up on the studio cam.  Yeah, let me get.  And then you guys could, like, you guys could, like, yeah.  Yeah, take a look at it.  Wait, you've got to go back further, Rick.  Then you won't be able to see the splooge, though.  You can't say that word.  I think people know what we're talking.  You can't really see it. 
[00:53:30]  No?  I don't think so.  Can it be set up somewhere so it's just there on camera?  All right, don't move.  Let's see that.  That might work.  Don't move.  See, you're in.  Yeah, it's a contract.  That's the worst problem.  Yeah, it's not going to happen, but you guys get the idea.  I want more here.  Try that.  Studio cam, you could go to www.com.  We're really not doing much with it yet, but eventually it'll be a very important part  of our radio show.  You can't really see.  You can almost see a little on her cheek. 
[00:54:00]  You can't get the full impact of how much.  There we go.  How much frigging.  All right, try that.  That might work right there.  All right.  All right.  Just imagine what's all over there.  Okay.  All right.  Let's see if that works.  Yeah, well, on the left.  Let's see if that works.  See if anyone is commenting about that.  No, no, no, no, no.  Okay.  I'm trying to see.  It's a little out of focus, too.  But that's the problem now.  It's just not focused. 
[00:54:30]  That's what it is.  Yeah, a bunch of people saying they can't see it.  All right.  We tried.  Well, maybe we'll put it on the website with that little black bar over the eyes.  Right.  That tells, whenever I see that, I know I'm looking at some real good porno when they have  to blank the eyes out with that black bar.  All right, Ant.  Do you want to play one of the entries to the Most Offensive Song Contest?  Well, what are we going to do?  We announce a little contest.  And what? 
[00:55:00]  We're not going to do it?  All right.  We can't be pussies.  We've got to play all the entries that we think are interesting.  Like I said before, that's the object of this contest, the Most Offensive Song.  All right.  We're not playing it saying that it's a great tune.  Let's play this and have fun with it.  Well, no, we are.  And who sent this one in, Rick?  He goes by the name Fuel.  Fuel.  Fuel sent it in.  All right.  This is Fuel's entry into the Open Anthony Most Offensive Song Contest, Anthony. 
[00:55:30]  All right.  Hold on to your hats.  One, two, three, four.  How much is that dark in the window?  They say that dark is for sale.  How much is that dark in the window?  Don't make me pay extra for the mail.  Oh, I must take a trip to California. 
[00:56:00]  And I need someone to pull my lawn.  If I tie that dark in the long tree.  He can get the job done while I'm gone.  How much is that dark in the window?  The one with the long dangly arms. 
[00:56:30]  How much is that dark in the window?  I've got things need picking on my farm.  Oh, I have a wife.  What needs a meeting?  Oh, I can't afford to go to jail.  Oh, I can't afford to go to jail. 
[00:57:00]  If I make my dark, you do it for me.  I can't afford to go to jail.  I can't give what's coming to that well.  How much is that dark in the window?  Everybody.  My team could use a new H.  Oh, God.  They say that dark, you don't get cocaine. 
[00:57:30]  I can't afford to be half his whole race.  So how much is that dark in the window?  Great guitar.  They say that dark, you get some sale.  How much is that dark in the window?  Don't make me pay extra, because he's now. 
[00:58:00]  Okay, terrific.  God damn.  I apologize.  All right, that's fuel.  Well, the latest entry in the most offensive song ever, ever, ever contest that we're having.  Ever written.  Opie and Anthony show.  Again, let me reiterate, the opinions expressed in these songs are not necessarily the opinions of the Opie and Anthony show or WNEW. 
[00:58:30]  Well, the feedback's coming in nice and strong now, Anthony.  All righty.  Rock from Woodside on the instant feedback.  Fuel, not as good as the first song we played.  Oh, um.  What song was that?  We want you guys to keep track of all the songs we play.  The most offensive song ever.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was the one to the Barry Manilow song.  Barry Manilow.  That's right.  So already a lot of people think this isn't as good as the first one we played.  But musically, his guitar playing is a little lacking. 
[00:59:00]  His singing a little droning.  But, boy, lyrically, it truly is offensive.  Well, Fuel did give us another entry.  He did?  That we're going to play later on in the show.  All right.  Which is a little better than that one.  Jay, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I'm offended.  I'm white.  We are offended, and you're white.  Ring the goddamn gongs, that one.  Yeah.  They trust.  Well, we did warn you guys ahead of time.  That's the danger of doing a contest like this, you know?  It's not bad, though.  It's pretty good. 
[00:59:30]  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  Hey, let's go to Conrad.  Conrad.  Conrad, what's going on?  Yo, O&A.  Yeah.  Dude, I'm driving through Newark and Maplewood right now with the windows down and that song  playing.  You've got to see the looks I'm getting.  Yeah, you've got to watch where you play that one.  Oh, my God.  I forgot it was one of those days where you do want your windows down, the top down, you're  cranking the stereo, and that's coming out of your speakers.  Yeah.  That can't be a good thing.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  I've got to get out of here.  All right, Conrad.  Thank you. 
[01:00:00]  All right.  All right.  Nick, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you, Nick?  You should have the inappropriate bell on cruise control for that one.  We warned you.  I didn't really want to play that song, but I don't know what else to do.  If we're going to have a most offensive song contest.  Yeah, we've got to play.  We've got to play all the entries.  That's why I love you guys.  All right.  Thanks, Nick.  Later.  Bye.  Let's go to Scott.  Scott, what's going on?  We lost Scott.  He was scared, actually.  He goes, I am scared that I just listened to that song.  Tim, what's up?  You're next on NAW. 
[01:00:30]  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  That one sucked compared to the Barry Manilow version.  Yeah, it seems like the Barry Manilow song is still in the lead as we try to find the  most offensive song ever.  This one was like two repetitions over and over.  Yeah, yeah.  Darky in the window.  That kind of sucked.  Yeah.  He's got a point.  I agree with him.  All right.  After, you know, the third chorus of that you hear, you're a little tired of it.  Yeah, kind of shock values.  On and on and on.  All right.  Thank you.  I'll be one more thing.  Yeah.  Can you teach me how to make banana not bread, you home-egg faggot?  Over and out, Don.  Get out of here. 
[01:01:00]  Instant feedback coming in about the song, Anthony.  Bill from the city.  I bet that tune would make the top ten list in Memphis.  It probably would.  Show knee from New York.  I just broke my inappropriate bell.  John from the island.  That belongs on MTV's TRL.  It was a hit.  Oh, Jesus.  The NAACP checking in from Jersey.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  Okay.  Terrific.  Very inappropriate.  Let's go to Matt.  Matt, you're next on NAW. 
[01:01:30]  Okay.  Terrific.  That was one of the best things you guys have ever played.  I think the first one was better, though, but that was definitely a good, catchy tune.  All right.  Yeah, we have to decide which one's in the lead.  You're thinking the Barry Manilow song?  Yeah, I'd say Barry Manilow was better, but this one had a better guitar going.  All right.  Manilow.  Yeah, we want you guys to pay attention to all the songs we play.  We do have another entry later on today.  Oh, great.  All right.  What time?  All right.  I don't know.  All right, cool.  I'll be listening all day anyway.  All right, cool.  All right, take it easy, guys.  Bye.  Later.  Awful. 
[01:02:00]  Horrendously awful.  Well, that's the object of the contest.  I mean, what are we going to say?  Right?  Right.  Right.  Seth, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  This is what happened.  I was listening to the song.  Yeah.  And I got to a gas station to grab a pack of cigarettes.  Yeah.  And I left my windows open, and I had the thing blasting.  And there was a black lady right next to me in a car with her kids, and she was getting 
[01:02:30]  her kid out of the car to get something in the store, and she started flipping out on  me.  How can I listen to that kind of stuff?  What's wrong with me?  Going nuts.  Wow.  Crazy stuff.  Crazy stuff.  Is it as good as the first song?  I think it's better.  All right.  I think it's much better.  Great song.  Thank you, bro.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  We got the guy that wrote the song on line four here.  Jeff, what's up?  How are you doing?  Good.  Hello.  Hey.  What's up, Jeff?  Nothing.  You were the guy that wrote that song, huh? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  I wrote it yesterday.  Well, you're getting mixed reviews on your song.  Yeah.  You know, I know it drones a little bit.  What are you going to do?  It was just at two minutes, I was like, yeah, it's done, but whatever.  Yeah.  Put it in.  All right.  We're going to play your other entry a little later on in the show.  I think that one's worse.  What?  The one we just played?  No, I think the second one's worse.  Yeah, I believe so.  I think that one's more offensive.  All right, man.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you.  See you.  Well, Ant, there you have it.  The latest entry in the worst song ever written. 
[01:03:30]  Not bad.  By Fuel.  It's a contender, but I don't know if it'll hold up.  Jeff, a.k.a. Fuel.  Very good.  All right, man.  We've got to take a break.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  A bunch, ladies and gentlemen.  You guys are really funny and stuff, but you guys take us too far to the point where  I literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show.  Who's going to take a mitle?  A mitle.  107.  WNAW.  Diarrhea, wave, hit prisons. 
[01:04:00]  Supper blade.  In Kingston, Jamaica.  Jamaican prison.  Jamaican prison.  That's got to be some great accommodations they got there in a Jamaican prison, huh?  And all the inmates getting diarrhea because of bad supper.  A mass outbreak of diarrhea has hit two Jamaican prisons with more than 1,000 convicts suffering.  Doctors are struggling frantically to contain the outbreak, which inmates have blamed on their 
[01:04:30]  Sunday supper.  The Sunday supper, just in case you're wondering.  Yeah.  Spicy crab.  Spicy crab soup.  Spicy crab soup.  Chinese cabbage.  Chakotoy is our Chinese cabbage.  Rice, peas, and chicken.  No, no, they didn't have the rice, peas, and chicken.  Sunday meal of rice, peas, and chicken.  Opie, you're getting the story wrong.  I breached a cut.  Oh, they should have got the rice, peas, and chicken, but instead they got the spicy crab 
[01:05:00]  soup and the Chinese cabbage.  Cabbage and some kind of vegetable taro.  Taro.  Whatever that is.  And, uh...  Oh, no.  Diarrhea, cha-cha-cha.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Angry prisoners on Monday dump scores of paper bags loaded with feces in passageways to the  cell blocks in protest.  That's great.  So they have the bad supper.  Everyone has diarrhea. 
[01:05:30]  Now they're putting the diarrhea in paper bags.  You know what's great?  You go to a zoo and look at the monkeys.  What do they do?  They crap in their hand and throw it at the people that are standing outside the cages.  Correct.  Doesn't sound like much different is happening in these Jamaican prisons.  No.  Oh, my God.  Throwing their feces at people because they get diarrhea.  That's great.  Now, the treatment was hampered because some prisoners refused to come out of their cells  for medication, fearing attacks from other inmates.  A special security team was going to cells to give inmates on-the-spot treatment if needed. 
[01:06:00]  This medical team had to go from cell to cell to give them treatment as there's diarrhea  all over their cells.  I heard one clever inmate lit the bag on fire in front of the warden's door, knocked, and  ran away.  That old gag.  All right.  So, they're working overtime to pinpoint the source of the epidemic.  But there you have it.  A thousand convicts in Kingston, Jamaica, suffering from diarrhea, Anthony. 
[01:06:30]  Diarrhea.  After a bad Sunday suffering.  We're clapping.  Clapping all over you. 
[01:07:00]  Hey.  We're clapping.  My pants are all full of doom.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I wonder how to feel through.  Hey.  Because every day we care the price.  We're delivering sacrifice. аn, kaн, kaн, kaн.  And it's true.  Hey.  The clock in.  Hey.  The timing's not the pain of the past. 
[01:07:30]  The timing.  And I hope the timing's gonna last.  Hey.  The bullet can stop us now when we get the bed so we won't find  Neither can we go now or so  Right there's a good night, life is not much far than gold  Okay, terrific 
[01:08:00]  Hey  Just see the tin on fire  Just see the diarrhea  Spraying mud in Jamaica 
[01:08:30]  Hey, Marco's down there  I like the new Fat Boy Slim 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, we're doing ONA bitches on the show every day  Well, an outbreak of diarrhea and pink syndrome major, Anthony  Oh, I want to drop it  Come on, we drop on you, we drop it  Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, let me try, Johnny, Johnny 
[01:09:30]  Okay, terrific  Yeah  Johnny, I want to drop it  I want to drop it  Hey  Well, it must not be very, you know how it sucks when you have diarrhea anyway, and you're in the best of conditions  Imagine that, a Jamaican prison  And you're losing it  All right  Jesus  David, what's up, man?  Yo, how are you doing, guys? 
[01:10:00]  Good, what's up, David?  Yeah, I got it figured out, I know what happened in Jamaica  The warden was at the bottom of it  He wanted to put an end to all of the gay sex going on there  Hey!  That would definitely put a damper on it  Hey!  Yeah, that would, that would wreck the party, wouldn't it?  Absolutely  Sure, keep it up  All right, David  Hey!  Don't the prison look like the mud people from Woodstock  Hello, O.P.  I'm a sex star  Yeah, sure 
[01:10:30]  It's the truth  I'm a sex star  You can measure up to beat the porn stars up  Yeah!  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!  It's like a little naughty, O.P.  He screws everybody!  I'm a sex star  We love to see you  He's an excellent physical specimen  I start gagging  Yeah, sure  It's the truth  Oh, my God  The pants are all sticky  Oh, my God, I'm getting titillated  O.P. and Anthony  This is stupid  Somebody's got to get laid  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!  187 WNEW  Hey, Anthony, Mountain Dew

[01:11:30]  Notre Dame  Okay  Actually, not really  Really?  A lot of the powerhouses aren't that great this year, like North Carolina  There's no stand-alone, like, kick-ass one  Nah  Is UConn good?  UConn is, what, ranked 22nd in the nation right now?  What about Boston?  Boston?  No, Boston doesn't have any really good teams in the 20 this year  No  All right, well, I'm sticking with Iona, then  All right, very good  We encourage the faithful listeners to go to www.wnew.com next week  To register your picks for who will make it to the Final Four, Anthony

[01:13:00]  Moving right along today  Our phone line, 212-757-1027  The fax line, 212-957-9639  Give us a call if you want in on the show today  Coming up at 430, Louis Black  Yeah, always a pleasure to have him in the studio  We love when Louis Black stops by the studio 
[01:13:30]  He loves talking about current events and things like that  Things going on  Stuff that he finds funny in the news, Anthony  Yes  You know, he's probably got a lot of talk about what's happening in politics  I guess McCain bowed out today  Yeah, that's it  Bradley bowed out  We kind of knew a while ago that it was going to be Bush and Gore  Yeah  Going for all the marbles  And I just have a feeling George W. Bush is going to be our next president  You really think so?  George W. Bush, just like Daddy 
[01:14:00]  Get in there  President  I don't know  I think so  But Gore's going to have to  First of all, he's got that whole image problem of being a stick figure  And then he's got the Clinton thing  Yeah  You know, he was vice president of a president  That was in there for two terms  I don't think I ever saw him in the same room together  Tell you the truth  And he had no clue what was going on  You know, he didn't know what his president was doing  He knew exactly what was going on  And I think 
[01:14:30]  I just think that sucks  I mean, you know, he was going for the primary and stuff  You would think Clinton would help him out  But how many times have you seen Clinton on the tube  Endorsing Gore  Yeah  For the nomination  The answer would be zero  None  You don't see him  They're keeping him apart  And if I was Gore, I'd be so pissed at Clinton  Like, hey, you got eight years as president  I hope you're happy  Because you really screwed my chances  You jackass  Yeah  Not that Gore has much of a chance  I don't know 
[01:15:00]  Because people that vote on party lines  He'll get all those votes  Because he's a Democrat  But, I don't know  He doesn't have any charisma  He doesn't have  Not that Bush does  But, I mean, he's got to shake the image of being a nothing  Piece of wood  The one thing you've got to worry about, though, Anthony  McCain  If he runs as an independent  He's going to screw up the whole election  Right  The Perot factor  And I think McCain is so pissed off at the tactics that Bush used  With the negative campaigning and stuff  He might want to just shove it up his you-know-what 
[01:15:30]  I don't know  Because that always wrecks the voting  Yeah  Yeah  When you have kind of, technically, two Republicans on the ticket  Splits it up  Splits it up bad  That's what happened  Perot took a lot of votes away from Bush  And Clinton won  I don't know  We'll see what happens  All right  There's your political break  There you go  Political commentary from Ovi and Anthony  I personally don't even care who our next president is  Yeah  Because nothing really changes for me  Oh, they all have great big ideas, Anthony  They all want to, you know 
[01:16:00]  As they campaign, they tell you everything they're going to change  They want a red or it's going to be  They all want to reduce taxes  They all want, you know, health insurance for everybody  Right  Nothing changes  No  We just chug along  Just chug along  The economy goes up, it goes down  Things happen  It's on autopilot  Speaking of  Dow making a great recovery today  154  Really?  Closed  NASDAQ huge  With 150 points  On the upside  Very nice 
[01:16:30]  Very good  Travis  Yeah  What's up, Travis?  Yo, I swear to God  I was on the bus yesterday  This is a really scary thing  This black girl's talking about the election  Right?  Mm-hmm  And they believe that George Bush Sr. is running  They're like, oh, he running again  Scary thought  Oh, he running again  No, that's true  That's not a joke  They did a poll  And up until two weeks ago  Everyone thought it was his father running for president again 
[01:17:00]  A lot of people still think it's George Bush running again  That's just friggin' scary  In fact, and these people are going to decide, you know, who our next president's going to be?  I don't know  I think  I know  I don't know  George W. should be running for president of Quick Records  All right, Travis, thank you  All right  Bye  Let's go to Rocco  Rocco, you're next on N.E.W.  Just take a step back for a sec, guys  Yeah  You were talking about how many times Bill Clinton has actually went and stumped for Al Gore  Yes  You think it carries any weight?  I don't think so  I mean, I think that was part of the strategy 
[01:17:30]  Was to keep Bill Clinton and Al Gore separate  So we have a fighting chain  Oh, yeah, that's what we're talking about  We understand all that  But, I mean, you know, if Al Gore, you know, sat around and knew exactly what Clint was up to  And didn't speak, you know, I don't want that guy as my next president  But then you've got to think of the flip side of that  If he comes out and says, you know, Bill Clinton's outbanging everything that moves  You think the Democrats are going to look to him to carry the party in 2000?  It just shows you what a lunatic Clinton is and what everybody thinks of him  Because if you have a two-term president and an incumbent vice president running for the presidency 
[01:18:00]  You have the two-term president just pushing this guy every second  He was president for two terms  Yeah, under normal circumstances  You know, you're dealing with some hillbilly guy from Arkansas  I'm amazed  I'd have a lot more respect for Al Gore if he opened his big, you know, trap  When the whole Clinton thing was going down, Al Gore was in Hawaii  They got him on the exact opposite part of the globe  Well, what stateful place to be?  And I don't think to this day he's, well, yeah, he started, like, talking bad about the president and his actions, finally 
[01:18:30]  Yeah  Long after it meant anything, you know  I just would have a lot more respect for the guy if he spoke up  You know, that's party suicide  There you go  That's how the politics are  So who are you voting for?  Me?  George?  No, nobody  I mean, I'll do George W. I voted for his father  I usually, you know, I'm not, I don't vote strictly party line  George W. 
[01:19:00]  In this case, he happens to be the better of the two  W. George W.  Got it?  Got it  Who are the hot chicks standing behind George W.?  That's his daughters, right?  Is it?  Someone's daughters  That's what we need  More hotties in the White House, man  Come on, bring them on  Screw this Chelsea  Get Chelsea out of there  It took eight years and she still, you know, doesn't look that great  Chelsea's, now she  You know something, let me tell you  She's turned around, I understand  No, no, now she's turning again, though  Oh, really?  She went through that phase where she looked like a chicken  A chicken with a fright wig on 
[01:19:30]  You know what?  Then she went  She's got that hair, though  Yeah, well, then she went through a phase where she started in college  And it was almost acceptable  Like, you're looking and going, all right  You know, there's something going on there  Now, it's her mother with her fingers stuck in a light sock  That's what she looks like now  She's starting to really look like Hillary  I saw a picture in the paper of her  And I thought it was Hillary for a second  Get a penis, I'm playing quit now  All right, Rocco  But a couple of hotsters in the White House like that  It's going to be 
[01:20:00]  Bush  It doesn't matter  Bush in the White House  There'll be plenty of Bush in the White House now  Real Bush instead of that Barbara Bush  God bless America  All right, thank you, Rocco  Thank you, guys  That's what we need  It's going to be a boring four years, though  Whoever gets in  Like you said, you're right  Now that Clinton's term is coming to an end  I'm kind of going to miss the guy  How are you going to compete with a president  Who is getting his thingy done in the Oval Office?  There's nothing you can do  Yeah  Unless he comes to a press conference  With a vibrating butt plug in place 
[01:20:30]  And his pants down  How are you doing?  Just thought I got a little vibrating butt plug  Yeah  Brian on line four wants to say  Well, Bush is killing people in Texas  Well, we know that  I was getting hummers  Amazing  It's just amazing  We learned yesterday that Bush  That Clinton was amazed by a screensaver  A screensaver  Technology of the 21st century out there  He's amazed by a screensaver  Brian  Hey, what's going on, O&A?  What's up?  Big fan, man  Listen, you know, you guys know he's got the 
[01:21:00]  Listen, I'm for capital punishment, too  Yeah, and he's frying them like crazy down there in Texas  Yeah  Even though they took that form of the death penalty away from us, unfortunately  Women, children  Listen, I'm a full supporter of that  However, and we all know Clinton's an idiot  And we all know why Clinton and Gore have been separated  You know, with Gore running here  But the fact is  If you look at Bush  The guy's out of his mind  You don't  It's everything you don't know about Bush  And that's not talked about 
[01:21:30]  Like what?  It makes me nervous  Like what?  Listen, I don't hear  People calling in  And I know supporters of your show  These guys out there  Everybody that supports your show  They're pro-choice  Bush isn't pro-choice  Who can  Do you  Let me ask you something  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  I hate when they use that as an issue  The pro-choice issue  Listen to me on the pro-choice issue  How many Republicans have been in office since Roe vs. Wade?  I have no idea  A hell of a lot  And you know what?  The women's right to have an abortion has not been taken away 
[01:22:00]  It is not an issue  It isn't  No, it isn't  It is  Holy mother of pearl  So you're going to sacrifice everything that is an issue  In a presidential race  Just because a guy is against a woman's right to have an abortion  Come on, man  Bush?  You want to vote for Bush?  The guy  No, I don't want to vote  You don't know about Bush  It makes everyone nervous  All I'm saying is  They're not going to overturn Roe vs. Wade  Yeah, well I hope not  Because a Republican is in office 
[01:22:30]  Who's willing to take that risk?  Reagan was in there eight years  Bush was in there four years  Reagan was an effing morse  That's 12  But listen to me  That's 12 years of a Republican in a row in there  And they didn't take it away  Ten years of really right Republican  You know what's got to be done here?  Is  Radley needs to run as an independent  And we need to vote for him  Who cares how this guy dresses?  Hug a tree  Radley's the right guy for the job  Go hug a tree, my friend  Go get on one of those Zodiac boats with Greenpeace  Save a whale  Please  It doesn't matter  Believe me, I am the most pro-choice person on the face of the earth 
[01:23:00]  I think women should be able to walk down the street and pull their goddamn uterus out if they want  On Broadway  I don't care  Believe me  But a Republican president has nothing to do  Nothing to do  With pro-choice  Alright  Don't worry about it  There's other issues  Alright  Well, I don't agree  But, hey  What are you going to do?  Listen, big fan, guys  Thank you  That's people trying to scare you into voting one way or the other 
[01:23:30]  Are you really  With both sides  Are you really into the Bush thing or what?  No, I'm really not into the Bush thing  I'm not into you, the guy, really  I'm just  I don't think the Gore thing is  I don't see that happening  You know?  I think Bush will get in there  And that's it  It'll be business as usual  Business as usual  Doesn't matter  He's going to  He's going to say he's going to try to reduce taxes  Oh, yes  Hotties in the White House  Yeah  That's all  It doesn't matter  Hotties in the White House  That's all I care about 
[01:24:00]  Just keep the economy strong  That's all we care about  Webcam in the kids' room  Come on  Come on  Alright  Well, I don't know  I mean, the whole political discussion gets boring fast, right?  Well, it all depends on the spin you put on it  And we do have Lewis Black coming in soon  Yeah, he'll give a  He'll hit on some of that  He'll give a great spin on that in about 15 minutes  He'll be here  Lewis Black from Comedy Central  On the line, Smelly Karen  Well, that's the only way to, you know, describe you 
[01:24:30]  Karen  That's enough  Hey  Hi  We're not going to abuse you  You know, I went to the studio board  And I'm getting pounded by the descriptions of the show  I even  Hold on  Hold on  We'll get to you in a sec  Alright  Scott says we don't know anything about politics  Scott  It's very true  How you doing, guys?  Alright  Now, explain your side  And then we will counter  Okay  Well, first of all  Hold on  Alright, hold on  Let's do it now without cursing 
[01:25:00]  Okay  He'll give an S about abortion  Okay  Bush tried to have it overturned  Mm-hmm  And many Republicans in states are trying to have it overturned  And have been for quite a few years  And in many states, not this one, have been very successful  That's what you fail to see  Oh, please  That is not  That isn't true  It's very true  You know that right-wing campaign has been on for at least ten years  Forcing the medical schools to stop teaching how to do abortion 
[01:25:30]  You know something?  There's propaganda on both sides  There is propaganda on both sides  Yeah, I know  I agree with you  And the fact of the matter is  It is a law that has been passed  And that's it  Bush being in there  Or Gore being in there  Isn't going to do anything one way or the other  Okay  As far as life and life  What about Supreme Court justices?  Appointing them?  Yeah  Yeah, well  The next president gets the point  At least three, if not four 
[01:26:00]  And that's enough to overturn Roe v. Wade  Yeah, well  We'll see  We'll see if that happens  I severely doubt it  I severely doubt it  It would be an enormous civil war  I think hinging your choice on pro or choice or pro-life  As far as voting for a president goes  Is really silly  Well  That's like  It might seem so being that you're a guy  That's like  If you're a woman  No, I'm saying  It's a little bit of a different story, don't you think? 
[01:26:30]  No, it's like  It's like deciding what restaurant you're going to eat at  Based on what color the napkins are on the table  That's what I'm talking about  It is  Do you think that's how important abortion is to a woman?  But no  I'm saying  It's very important to a woman  It's not an issue  It won't matter one way or the other  It hasn't for years  That's what I'm saying  Yes, it is an important issue  Is it an important issue in a presidential election?  It shouldn't be  It doesn't matter  I agree with you that it shouldn't be in an ideal world  But it is  I mean 
[01:27:00]  You guys are here  You were in Boston before that  You know  You've got to go out to some of the rural areas  It's a  It's a much different story  Every church you pass has  Of course  Enormous fields of crosses for the unborn  I know  It's been happening for years  Don't you hear what I'm saying?  It doesn't matter who's in office  It definitely matters  There have been years of Republicans in office  It doesn't matter  Don't you think that every single appointee  That Reagan and Bush made to the Supreme Court  Was scrutinized over this question?  Yeah 
[01:27:30]  And why were they picked?  They were picked because they were pro-life  Oh  Not necessarily  And that's why so many  Especially under Bush  Didn't get in  Yeah see  It's not like they all of a sudden decide  Who's going to get in  And they get in  Supreme Court justices  They have to run through the gauntlet  On both sides  If someone is totally pro-life  They're not going to have an easy time to get in  Just because George W. Bush is president  Well it depends who controls Congress  If you have a Republican Congress  And you have a Republican president 
[01:28:00]  Can I play ping pong please?  We're having a debate  I feel like I'm in French history class  All I'm saying is  After years of Republicans being in office  Through the 70s  It's not an issue  Okay?  Alright well besides which  Bush is a moron  Isn't that not an important issue?  I think they're all morons  Thank you Scott  Alright  Bye  They're all morons  You guys really want us to play this song?  People are going to freaking lose their minds  Which one's this?

[01:34:30]  That was definitely better than the first one you played today  Well we have another one to play  And I don't even think it's going to come close to what we just heard  But you know you got to play them  It was great  Because honestly that song's been on our desk for the last couple of days  And I was like I don't even know if we can freaking play this damn thing  There was a couple of bleeps out  A couple of bleeps?  You guys only heard half the song  They were dumping out of it like crazy  I could hear the dumps on the air  Yeah we had to put another bleep in  Oh it was so funny  We got to play it in its entirety 
[01:35:00]  Yeah definitely  But somebody here Chris on Instant saying  Guys the air sick song was more offensive  But the Barry Manilow parody was to me funnier  Now let me tell you  It doesn't matter  We are looking for offensive  The most offensive song  Not funny  Well it's up to you guys to decide  I mean is the one from air sick in the lead  As far as most offensive goes  Anthony on Instant Feedback just saying  Holy ass winner  Well  We'll see  It just puts the bar up that much higher 
[01:35:30]  I don't know if I can be part of this contest anymore  What did you grow a vagina?  Dude  Did you hear the lyrics to that song?  Yeah  Did you hear what I heard?  I am putting it in the context of what it is  The most offensive song  I think they did a fine job at writing a very offensive tune  We had that on our desk for a while  We weren't really sure what to do with it  Then the whole abortion issue came up  And then Rick runs it in here  Well the pliers thing was pretty much  Yeah  That's exactly what I'm talking about 
[01:36:00]  Alright alright alright  Cut it out  Alright syndication now guys  Cool  Yeah  Thank you  Let's go to Eric  Eric you're next on WNEW  Hey O&A  Hey  I'll tell you what  You have a vagina  That thing was  That was horrible  Yeah that was wrong  That's it  That was absolutely wrong  And I gotta tell you  If you got anything in the coffers back there  That's worse than that  I don't know if I can handle it  I'll get into an accident now every five minutes 
[01:36:30]  The scary part about this contest is  Now we raised the bar  I can only imagine what's going to come in next  You know people are going to go out of their minds  Trying to do worse than that now  Yeah  Anything else is going to sound tame at this point  Yeah  Oh my goodness  Oh by the way Anthony  Yes  President Clinton is amazed at the screensaver  Yesterday he just found out Air Force One  Is not a choo choo trainer  Hey O&A syndication now  Take it easy guys 
[01:37:00]  Thanks man  Yeah we do have one more song to play  One more entry into the contest  We're not going to  I'm not going to give the title out yet  We have a lady on the line  I was waiting for this  Jeannie  Hi it's Janine  Janine I'm sorry  Hello  How are you  You're five months pregnant huh  Yes I am  And that song made me absolutely sick to my stomach  Yeah  Yeah  Opie you should have went with your instincts and not played it  Well it's the most offensive song contest  What is it supposed to do 
[01:37:30]  It's too offensive for the most offensive contest  Yeah actually I think that kind of crossed the line  No but that's just it  And it's not the Opie show  You know what I'm saying  We all have a vote in this  And I'll tell you  I was definitely on the fence with that song  I can't lie  I can't lie  And I'm the one that usually says the sickest crap for this radio show  I know  I'm very surprised at you Anthony  Very surprised  What do you think  I'm agreeing with the song  Is that it Janine?  You sound like you know  Do you think I'm condoning what the song says  I hope not 
[01:38:00]  Well I think we all agreed that we wanted to have this contest  After the full blown eight song  That Jay Moore and his buddy Mike DiNicola wrote  And I just didn't expect it to get to this  That's all I'm trying to say  If you think about it really  It's got to be offensive  You know and you guys agreed  You said let's go for the contest  I remember we were asking the audience  We said it would get brutal  We said it would get way out there  Yeah  You want a contest where we screen it  And oh it's too offensive for the most offensive song contest 
[01:38:30]  No  I can't imagine what was dumped out  I can't imagine  Yeah  Alright  Alrighty  Thank you  Bye  Let's go to J.R.  A lot of people have comments Anthony  J.R. you're next on N.E.W.  What's up fellas  How we doing?  Good  My partner and I work in Staten Island  On an ambulance  About four or five months ago  We put an inappropriate bell on the dashboard  Great stress relief  We broke the damn thing  I'm dying here  Yeah  You guys are out of control

It's TJ  TJ sorry  Guys you sent me the inappropriate bell  Yeah  There it is  I just use it a ton of times  And it was perhaps the most offensive song I've heard  But it was so offensive that it was funny  Yeah that's true  See  Does it get so offensive that it goes all the way around in the spectrum and become funny? 
[01:39:30]  I think so  I'm actually going to see Paul Bond tonight  And I suggest everybody go see him  He's a funny guy  Maybe he'll play him  Yeah  Where's Paulie playing tonight?  Rascal  Alright maybe he'll sing the song for everyone  Yeah I doubt it  Yeah alright  Alright PJ  Thanks  Bye  A couple more and we'll move on  Brian you're next  What's up?  Goddamn boys  You're playing that song again  I'm fighting myself  That was brutal  It was beyond brutal 
[01:40:00]  Oh my God  You know I'm pro-choice  But I'm starting to like you know  Think about that after hearing that song  Wow we might have changed people's opinion  We might have changed people's opinion on the whole issue with one song  Goddamn  Alright Brian  Alright thanks  Bye  Trish what's going on?  Well I just called to say that those guys are far from offensive  They're past the psychotic mode  They need to have psychiatric help if they can write a song like that 
[01:40:30]  Alright  That was really sick  Cool  Super sick  Especially when they said about the bones cracking  Oh my God  That was a great line  I mean for a woman that's a pretty tragic thing to hear  And believe it or not we're trying to get more ladies to listen to our show  Oh yeah that'll help right there  Yeah right  Right  Well I listen every day on my way home from work  So I drive 50 miles and I appreciate it  Alright  I've had a lot of good luck  Thanks a lot  Thank you Trish  Bye  We ain't playing it again anytime soon

We're doing alright  I tell you I'm 56 years old  That has got to be the most offensive thing I've ever heard  Yeah  I've ever seen in my entire life  Not even song wise or anything just ever  I tell you the contest ends with this song  Yeah maybe we should just end it right now  I really think so  I can live another 56 years and I don't think I'll hear anything as offensive  Well if we're going to end it you might as well play the winning song

[01:44:30]  Billy from Air Sick, what's up?  Hey, this is Corky Opie.  Shut up.  Throw some hair on your ass.  Shut up.  Like, oh, it's so offensive.  Oh, come on, Opie.  Give me a break.  It's freaking funny.  I can't believe you got dumped out of the bloody gash.  Well, and you know something?  You're saying it probably just got dumped out of the C word.  Yeah.  I mean, that we knew, but that was intentional. 
[01:45:00]  But the other stuff was not intentional.  I went over that with a fine tooth comb.  Well, Billy, I just don't see anyone beating you guys at this point.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  I mean, I guess we'll encourage the listeners to try, but...  Well, you know, Opie, you say you have a need, we fill the need.  I understand that.  Well, come on, don't be whiny about it.  Oh, my God.  It was my turn to play good cop in the show.  Will you shut up?  Oh, but it was great. 
[01:45:30]  I give you guys, you know what, kudos for playing it.  Because Paulie and I, we were sitting there thinking about it going,  you think they got the nuts to do this?  It sat on our desk for a while.  We were just kind of looking at it going, you know, what do we do with this?  Hey, guys, we almost sent him in on the Rissudo network.  Oh, like we wouldn't have been able to tell.  We were going to call him by Kid Touching Harry or something, you know?  All right, man.  All right.  Play it again.  Play it again. 
[01:46:00]  Play it again.  The people haven't spoken.  Play it again.  Play it again.  Look at all the phone calls, Opie.  Everyone wants to hear it.  We got Chuck from the radio check show. 
[01:46:30]  What's up, Chuck?  Yo, man, all I got to say is I'm about to leave.  I'm going home.  I'm about to get on the elevator.  And all of a sudden, in my head and coming out of my mouth is,  how much is that dark?  What the hell am I doing?  That was the entry from earlier, yes.  Oh, my God.  Here, I got one for you.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga.  Say it every morning for breakfast.  Makes my teeth white.  Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Now, that could win. 
[01:47:00]  Just want to make it perfectly clear that a black man just said that.  For some reason, it's okay if you guys say that stuff.  Absolutely.  All right.  Thank you, Chuck.  Sounding good with the radio.  Take it easy.  All right.  Well, you sick Fs.  It is the people's radio show.  And look at all the calls coming in.  You sick Fs.  I can't be a dad. 
[01:47:30]  You bitch, I've been had.  Punch your stomach.  Rod pliers, they got stuck.  Your c**ch is bleeding.  Hangers in your uterus.  Don't stop, you're crying.  I think I hooked the fetus.  Want to kill the fetus? 
[01:48:00]  I just want to yank it out of their c**s.  Please, D&C.  Suck down little toes and knees.  Back, back, yank.  Can't hear the little bones crack.  Lose, can't choose.  Gonna pull it till it comes loose.  Laugh your goddamn heads off. 
[01:48:30]  You sick Fs.  Goofy and Anthony.  There's no level too low that you guys want to take to.  This is a fun one.  Stop.  L-2-7-W-N-E-W.  You sick Fs.  Oh my God.  You guys happy now?  There you go.  You needed to hear it again.  Did you see some of the faces out there just like horrified?  You sick Fs.  Is that the most horrific song you've ever heard? 
[01:49:00]  And Chuck just became a dad.  Oh.  What do you think?  Chuck from the Radio Chick Show.  His lip is like quivering.  Look at it.  Look at his lip.  Dude, I'm like terrified.  You know what?  It's like watching somebody take a dump or something.  It's horrible.  You know what I mean?  Like, why am I watching this?  Why am I listening?  Why am I laughing?  What the hell is wrong with me?  I'm like so embarrassed right now.  But that is so funny.  I'm sorry.  Probably the most offensive song that could ever be. 
[01:49:30]  I don't know how anyone's going to top that one.  You're going forward with the contest?  Oh, yeah.  We have to.  What are we supposed to do?  Call it off?  We throw it out there.  The people have responded.  We have to continue with the contest.  All of a sudden, Lewis Black isn't showing up anymore.  Why?  Oh my God.  I wonder why.  Where's Lewis?  All right.  He's writing another song to try to beat that one.  Yeah.  I'll see you guys later.  And I'd like to say that I'm officially disassociating myself with this song.  Ah.  Very smart move.  There he goes, Chuck.  Why is the boss walking down the hall? 
[01:50:00]  No.  Really?  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Cut him off at the pass, Rick.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Lewis Black has entered the studio.  We'll talk to him next.  Hey, kids.  It's your old pal, Krusty.  And if I wasn't blackmailed into a lifetime contract with Itchy and Scratchy, I'd have Opie  and Anthony on my show.  Syndication now.  Thank God, Lewis Black has arrived, Anthony. 
[01:50:30]  Some sanity to the show.  Lewis Black had nothing to do with the last half hour of radio.  No.  He has no clue what we just did, matter of fact.  I was on the subway.  We're not even going to fill him in.  It was pretty bad.  We want to keep him out of this mess.  We've got to take a couple of phone calls, then we'll get to Lewis Black.  Contest is a contest.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, you're next on WNAW.  What's up?  Pete.  Owen, Eddie.  Hey. 
[01:51:00]  You guys are sick in the head.  What did we do?  You got some friends in Boston you want to see?  They're going to send you back pretty soon.  I know.  I heard the Greaseman is looking for some friends to join a support crew.  Yeah, the Greaseman joke.  Well, we are doing the most offensive song contest.  It got a little ugly today.  What can I tell you?  My palm just swatted a sweat and can't hold a steering wheel anymore.  I know.  We all have that feeling today, Pete.  Have a good one.  You guys suck.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Larry.  Larry, you're next on N.E.W. 
[01:51:30]  Hey, Owen.  How are you guys doing?  All right, Larry.  You guys almost created a huge backup here on Route 80, man.  Really?  On the merges, yeah.  I'm knocking cars left and right over here trying to keep it straight.  Right.  Man, you guys got to keep that contest closed.  It's over.  You're going to throw your butts out of there.  Yeah, I don't see anyone beating that song.  We do have one more entry that we're going to play in the 5 o'clock hour show.  Thank you, Larry.  All right.  You have a good one.  All right.  Let's get a female point of view here.  Marianne.  Hi.  Hi. 
[01:52:00]  What's up?  I think that you guys should definitely play that at least once a day.  Oh, yeah.  She likes it.  People are entirely too politically correct in this.  Right.  It's out of control.  And just wake some people up.  All right.  You know what I think?  If you're going to have a contest, don't you want the best of the best competing?  You don't want half-assed stuff.  So you've got to, if it's the most offensive song contest, you want the most offensive song,  not the most offensive song that was chosen to be played so it wouldn't offend too many people.  Exactly.  It defeats the purpose of the contest. 
[01:52:30]  Well, there's a lot of outrage today.  Where were all these people when we played full-blown AIDS?  That song, that was the first entry.  Indication now.  All right, Marianne.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wow.  What are they doing?  Lapsed calf.  John, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Great.  That song is totally offensive.  It makes Killer Kitten like a nursery rhyme.  Yes.  Yeah.  See, Killer Kitten doesn't seem all that bad anymore, does it?  All right.  That got a lot of, what are they, they had postings on web boards about that, huh? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  What, the Killer Kitten song?  Yeah, the animal rights activists all over Stephen Lynch for his little ditty there.  I'm going to come after you guys now.  Oof.  What are you reading about in the paper?  They'll be picketing tomorrow.  Yeah, wait until Fetus really makes the rounds.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Take care.  All right.  Forget about it.  Oh, man.  Well, enough of that for a while.  We have a responsible journalist here.  Oh, yeah.  That's where it's come to.  We saw your political commentary there on Super Tuesday.  It's sad when I am now almost mainstream, I'm going to have to kill myself. 
[01:53:30]  Isn't that something?  No.  You ever think?  No, I never thought.  Wayne Lewis, we're putting you on the webcam, if you don't mind.  No problem.  Because people have heard you on our show many times, and they would like to see what you  look like.  Yeah, this will really help.  These are actually in my head.  I wear them all the time.  I wear them in really big, ugly boots.  It's WNEW.com.  Go to the O.P. and Anthony section.  There's a link to the, it's called the Spaz Cam, and Louis Black is on there right now.  No offense. 
[01:54:00]  No, it's fine.  It's fine.  At least that puts me in a category I can deal with as opposed to responsible journalist.  When did you come on?  What day?  Compared to what's been on this show?  Compared to what's been going on in the past hour of this show.  Compared to this show, I'm becoming like the John Chancellor if he were alive.  Yeah, exactly.  It's insane.  That's what we're talking about.  It's just wrong.  What you are is directly proportional to the situation you're in.  So, you know.  Unbelievable.  When you're here, I don't know how much worse it can get than being on this show. 
[01:54:30]  And he still has no clue what just went on.  I swear to you, he has no idea.  I want to hear this thing during the break, though.  Yeah.  Very bad.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it'll help me.  Yeah.  I need my eyes opened.  I passed a guy coming on the way over, though.  It was, like, perfect, because since it's bright and sunny, the nuts are out.  And this guy's sitting wearing it.  I came around the corner and said, a black man with an afro, which makes it, what, 1967?  And he's sitting on the corner of 43rd Street with a sign that says, insult me for a dollar. 
[01:55:00]  You saw that, too?  A lot of people have been talking about him.  That was great.  Sandy and Rick's wife Linda saw the same guy today.  And I thought, you know, son of a, I wish I had the time.  Yeah.  That's what's sad.  I thought, I want to stop and just pretend he's somebody else and yell at him for a while.  You know, he'll probably make a lot of money.  He's performing a service, unlike a lot of people that just sit on the sidewalk looking for cash.  It's a service.  It's a terrific service.  You give him a 10 and tell him, I'm going to be here a while. 
[01:55:30]  You know, screw the buck.  That, that which is right across from that World Wrestling Federation restaurant, which just makes my block a peach to live on now.  You know, because when I think food, I think big sweaty guys.  You know, that was a theme restaurant I've been waiting for.  You know, nobody yelled, you know, they got upset about Disney and then, which was fine.  But then these other things are moving in and nobody, it's like, it's like they broke our back. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  You know, it's like nobody even pays attention.  And insane amounts of junk in the window.  We had our lunchbox and action figures.  I mean, it's unconscionable.  I mean, what is, I feel like I've literally felt since yesterday that I'm walking around on somebody else's planet.  I don't belong here anymore.  Things are passing me by.  And then an Applebee's on 42nd Street.  Nobody said, that's wrong.  Nobody said, you know, no, we don't need that.  You know, what is it, a neighborhood pub? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Where?  On Venus, it's a neighborhood pub.  You know, I want to come to New York and eat at a place that I can eat at, you know, at the strip mall.  Right.  And then you've got to go up a flight to get there.  They'll probably have handicap access up the wazoo.  Do you have one of those apartments where the neon lights come right into your place?  No, but it's close now with that jumbo thing that they got on 43rd now, that thing above, I guess it's ABC. 
[01:57:00]  But it's kind of neat, though, because it's like, since I don't do drugs, it's like, great,  you come out of the apartment and there's this big, huge sign right in your face, pulsing with stuff,  and you can't tell what it is, so you kind of feel disoriented.  It's great.  Times Square is getting amazing like that.  And then NASDAQ underneath, so that might as well be a sign.  Ha ha, you're not involved in this, screw you.  You're not seeing another dime today, are you?  Ha ha ha ha ha.  You put your stuff in the chump change thing, didn't you?  Yeah, you're down there with the idiots. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, you're in the farming group.  They had a scary image on the Jumbotron a couple days ago, Katie Couric's colon.  Oh, did they put that?  They put that up there when they were broadcasting live on the Today Show.  I'm serious.  I heard a few people hit the building thinking they were at the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel.  Like, wait a minute.  Oh, it's Katie's colon.  I almost drove into the Jumbotron.  I love that.  And then they'll yell about what you do.  It's like they have no sense of taste anymore, but they don't know they have no sense of taste.  They think they're doing a service, and it's news to stick a camera up Katie Couric's backside and show the world her colon. 
[01:58:00]  And you know what it made me want to do?  It made me want to leap down to my doctor and get one of them.  Yeah.  I've had one already, and I thought, oh, yeah, I've got to get another one, and this is really going to make me go do it.  Yeah.  I mean, why are you nuts?  Because Katie did it.  Katie did it, and it's creepy.  You know, and why, and hello, why isn't Katie doing something like, can we do this, can we find another way?  Hello?  Yeah.  You've got a phone that's an inch high. 
[01:58:30]  Can't we come up with something that you can go into Kazoober without, like, you know, doing damage?  I don't think that's right.  It's like an octopus.  It is.  It's like that Roto-Rooter thing, you know?  Yeah.  All you can think of.  And when I had it done, my doctor was like, boy, this is great.  It's just clean as a whistle.  Take a look.  Take a look.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, I see commercials all the time, you know, with fiber optics, information can fly from point to point over a wire that's thinner than a human hair. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  Well, can't they put a camera at the end of that?  Exactly.  And stick it up there?  No, it's got to be something like a tree trunk.  Yeah, exactly.  That's it coming up there.  Yeah, really.  It just doesn't make, you know, everything is kind of, like, completely askew at this point.  Yeah.  And I don't think it's coming back.  Yeah, no.  Where's it coming?  Times Square looks like a scene out of Blade Runner now.  It does.  Doesn't it, with all the video screens and everything?  I just don't know how those people work, though, with the lights just flashing through their office buildings and stuff now.  And then it's great, because you've got that at one end of the universe, 
[01:59:30]  and where I'm living is a fifth-floor walk-up, which I think I wish a kid would present it as a diorama as a science project.  Just pack it off the top, bring it to the gym, and go, look at what I grew here in 95 years.  Look at it here.  Here's a plant that must have started in 1902, when someone peed in the corner, because there probably wasn't indoor plumbing.  It's unbelievable.  And there's no heat in my apartment, because, you know, it's March. 
[02:00:00]  I mean, granted, today it's warm, but, you know, about two days ago when it was like 50 outside, my own thing's opposite.  If it's 50 outside, it's 10 inside.  If it's, you know, if it's like, if it's 10 outside, it's 115 inside.  It's insane.  You're the hippest city on Earth, and I got, like, metal in my, you know, it's that, what do they call that, steam heating, whatever they call it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, which is like, you know, couldn't we at some point, hello, what century?  Yeah, it's the same heat as that were in there when, you know, Hitler was blitzkrieging his way across Europe. 
[02:00:30]  You know, the guys came from their shuttle, ooh, look at this, ooh, ooh.  You know, but now, it's like, come on, you know, there's guys living in a trailer that at least have a knob.  The thermostat is up.  And how about this at 2 in the morning?  It sounds like the Concord's taking off in my bedroom.  It's that, it's that, and the tapping.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All of a sudden, you'll have to think, right, well, the reason is, because they're, what the hell is that? 
[02:01:00]  What's marching in my pipe?  The reason they haven't advanced, they're too busy thinking up new theme restaurants.  They got their priorities in order here.  And then I used to have one, it reminded me today, because when I first moved into the East Village,  and the apartment had the, the tub was right next to one of those pipes that just burns you.  Right, yeah.  You know, because that's another thing.  See, now at least strategically, I put furniture in front, you know, so I don't just, you know, hey, look at that, boom.  Ah!  Oh, no, I'm singed. 
[02:01:30]  It's unbelievable.  It's like insanity.  Oh, very funny.  There's quite a gap in technology, isn't there?  Well, especially in my neighborhood.  I got, you know, I've told you before, I got the, the block that, you know, the block that Rudy forgot.  It's the block that, you know, we're like, we're going to be the old New York block.  Oh, this was before, Rudy.  It was just like, look at the way they live.  It's where the cops stop people.  It's like the one block, and it's like stupid.  It's like, you know, you have 42nd Street, or, you know, you know, the 43rd is where they've got guys set up if you're going to the tunnel. 
[02:02:00]  You know, guys that come in, you know, my block, you know, so they're two in the morning.  I got to listen.  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's good.  It's a smart block, because tons of people are just whipping down that.  They don't go down the other ones.  I can't take it.  And it's, you know, you know, we're screwed, because it's about, what is it, 108 today?  Yeah.  It'll be, you know what that means, there's a blizzard coming, right?  Of course, of course.  Ah, yeah.  Just when we thought it was over.  Oh, yeah, no, this is going to be good.  And this is like, you know, this is when I feel like we're just in a Petri dish, you know? 
[02:02:30]  Someone's experimenting.  There's a heat up on them.  Put the Bunsen burner under there.  Yeah, let's see what kind of thing I can get glowing in Louis' lungs.  All right, I think everyone needs to breathe.  It's Louis Black.  Are you plugging anything, Louis?  Um, just my butt.  Thank you!  Oh, hey!  I'll wait for that.  Oh, that deserves that.  I'm going to be at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick.  Yeah. 
[02:03:00]  I actually even leave, when I leave here, I'm getting on the train to go out there.  Oh, you're doing it tonight, all weekend long?  Yeah, 8 o'clock tonight, 8.30 and 11 tomorrow on Saturday.  Right, and if you guys are in the area, you've got to see Louis Black.  Very funny guy.  And more with Louis, you can hang for a little while, right?  Oh, yeah, boy.  Hell yeah, we've got to talk a little politics.  And I've got to hear this thing while we're off.  Oh, yeah, okay.  A big controversial song.  All right, we'll be back with Louis in just a bit.  Stay there.  Dudes with dudes.  I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off.  Sophie and Anthony. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We're out of control.  We're so wacky.  All right, knock it off.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  I was just talking to Louis.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I rushed into a Stacker commercial.  I'm sorry I had to interrupt the conversation there, but it would have been dead air, so.  Oh, okay.  So, Louis, just hold that thought.  No problem.  Well, Stacker's very good.  You know, like today.  Come on.  It's beautiful weather out.  So, now you're starting to think, oh, my God, I got to get this body in shape. 
[02:04:00]  You got to take the coat off.  You got to take the coat off.  You're bulked up for the winter, and now what?  You got the belly, don't you?  Huh?  The bunt.  You got the big ass.  You got the awning over your genitalia.  What's going to remove that?  Stacker 2.  The world's strongest fat burner, Opie.  You're a dick do.  What does that mean?  Your stomach sticks out further than your...  Okay.  Okay.  Look at Louis.  Okay.  Louis wants to go home. 
[02:04:30]  Okay, terrific.  That's our new one, Louis.  I love that one.  Okay, terrific.  It says it all.  Hey, look at that girl.  She has a lovely bunt.  Okay, terrific.  Stacker 2.  Yeah, you got to burn it off.  The world's strongest fat burner.  Stacker 1.  Yeah, well, Stacker 2, all the unanswered questions that were left, when you were left hanging by Stacker 1.  Stacker 2 has 20 new levels.  Yes, 20 new levels. 
[02:05:00]  And better graphics.  And better graphics.  Stacker 2.  And the improved video chip.  Improved weapons, too.  Oh, my God.  Now, Stacker 2 is the world's strongest fat burner.  Yeah.  And it does three things.  It is, indeed, the world's strongest fat burner.  What else does it do?  It cuts the cravings to snack during the day, and it gives you a boost to energy.  Peps you up there when you're petering out during the end of the day.  Okay.  It adds up to losing weight.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Give them a call.  1-800-LITELINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E. 
[02:05:30]  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Thousands have proven it works.  Is this the best radio you guys can come up with?  1027 WNEW.  And we're hanging with Louis Black today, Anthony.  Yes.  From Comedy Central's Daily Show, The Daily Show.  He does Back in Black every Wednesday.  Yep.  Very funny last night, Louis.  Very funny.  Thank you.  And, Louis, where are you playing again?  I'm playing at the beautiful Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Just then, from those, just then, from Extraordinary Rawway. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Ah.  Inside of Rawway State Prison, the first of these scared straight shows I remember being from Rawway.  Yeah, exactly.  So, it's tonight at 8 and tomorrow, 8.30 and 11, 8.30 and 11 on Saturday.  And I'm working with Paul Mercurio, who's one of the writers from The Daily.  He's a very funny comic.  And we suggest everyone go see Louis Black tonight.  Yes.  The reviews on your live shows are unbelievable.  Well, that's right.  Every night, the day after you play, I mean, the email goes crazy. 
[02:06:30]  That's great.  I haven't seen you yet myself.  I can't wait.  Well, it's been nice.  I really, you have no idea.  I appreciate it, because folks really show up and say, you know, you guys suggested they come down.  And then I try to move away from them.  Yeah.  That's a good move.  Very safe bet.  No, it's very nice.  It's really fun.  They do.  They come out, and it's going to make a, and they're a great audience.  Yeah.  They keep coming back to see you, because they're convinced you're just going to hemorrhage on stage at some point.  They want to catch that.  They will come.  They want to be there, yeah.  Well, I'm really thrilled, because I get to get, you know, and the biggest, my biggest thrill about going to Jersey is getting on the New Jersey Transit, 
[02:07:00]  which is just to get on that train and go out there is such a pleasure, because the guy who designed the seats obviously had scoliosis.  You know, because it really is comfortable if you're pretty much crooked.  And you can see why they spent a lot of money.  I said they just should have a stick up your butt.  Playing on the stick.  You know, why do you waste the money on the leather?  Just have it so it's shoved up.  And maybe do the, do the biopsy then.  Oh.  Yeah, you get a free pipe. 
[02:07:30]  A free pipe load.  A free colonoscopy.  Unbelievable.  The Long Island Railroad, same thing.  It's exactly the same.  You sit there, and it feels like you have a knee in your back.  You're like, who designed this crap?  Yeah, and it's designed just to, wherever you're going, it's designed to, you get drowsy eight minutes before you get there.  No matter where you're going.  I think they release gas.  They do.  It's unbelievable.  And New Brunswick is really nice, because it's one of those places that's just far enough away that it's irritating.  You know?  You go, oh, man, we're almost, oh, we've still got to keep going. 
[02:08:00]  Son of a gun.  Oh, God.  And you can see why people settle there.  You know, because, you know, why would you want to be here,  when you could be just that far away that it just drives you nuts?  I'd go there tonight, but, oh, no, I'll go there.  I'll just go to New Brunswick.  I'll just go to a tiny town.  It's three blocks.  But they've done a nice job.  It's a nice club, actually.  Yeah.  And it's, but it's, you know, I would rather walk there.  Did you like the most offensive song there around this?  I think it's, it's been actually, it cut a new swatch in my brain. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  I think it actually, there was a section of my brain that still had trigonometry in it,  and it's gone.  It's just settled there.  It lasered it out.  It kicked it out.  It was unbelievable.  Yeah.  And that, I mean, if you're looking for the most offensive song, you want the best, the champ.  You know, you watch boxing.  You don't want to watch a couple of schleps.  You want to watch the heavyweight champs.  No, that is, that one, did anything come close? 
[02:09:00]  Well, one of the guys that wrote a song is on the line.  Let's talk to him really fast.  Anthony from the most offensive song, Anthony?  Yeah.  He wrote the Barry Manilow.  First one to come in after full-blown AIDS.  Right.  Anthony, what do you have to say today?  Guys, all I have to say is this is my concession phone call.  I would like to admit defeat right here and now on the air.  I was driving home.  I had to pull over.  I'm on a pay phone.  I'm 23, crying out loud.  Holding, holding, holding, just to say, I concede. 
[02:09:30]  Now, you're conceding.  Are you now backing this new song?  I am currently backing the new abortion song.  I'm not sure of the exact title, but, yes, I would like to put all my fans and all my people who supported me,  please vote for now the abortion song.  Fantastic.  That's the most offensive song ever.  Bravo.  That was terrific.  There we go.  A fine gentleman.  You just heard Anthony concede defeat to the abortion song and throw his backing behind the abortion song. 
[02:10:00]  Yes, that Billy and Paul from airsick.net wrote.  Well, Anthony, it takes a man to say that, and thank you very much.  Really.  Thank you, guys.  I appreciate it.  Breaking news.  In case you missed it, you just heard Anthony say,  you'll love how the reporters do that.  They have the speech, the concession speech, like you saw McCain do.  Yeah, let's ask Lewis about all that, man.  And then the reporters have to come on and tell you 20 times what he just said.  You want to reach in and just choke him.  Yeah.  I can't understand.  And then you got, uh, Tom Roca, Mr. Knightley News. 
[02:10:30]  What you just heard McCain say was...  I can't understand him telling me what McCain just said.  McCain is cheating to me, playing a whole face with a monkey.  What?  And I'm playing.  Still the funniest thing he ever said?  Achille Laurel.  Tom Roca, NBC Nightley News.  Leon Klinghofer thrown from the cruise ship of Achilles Loro.  How did he get so far in news where he's like the guy on NBC News and he can't talk? 
[02:11:00]  It's perfect.  It makes perfect sense.  He should go.  At least I'm not getting a pipe shoved in my butt.  Tom Roca, NBC Nightley News with the pipe of Katy Perry's bun.  The camera planted on my genitalia.  This ought to be fun.  I am backing the Kill a Fetish song.  That's the most offensive song, Tom?  Yes.  All right.  We'll be playing it as the new opener for NBC Nightley News. 
[02:11:30]  Well, Paul wants to thank Anthony for the concession.  This is too much.  Hello.  Paul from airsick.net.  How are you doing?  Paul Bond.  What's up, Paul?  Hey, I'd just like to thank Anthony for conceding.  We put a lot of hard time.  I'd like to thank God.  He's thanking God.  Thank the Almighty for putting the words in our heads.  Wonderful.  Don't forget Roe and Wade. 
[02:12:00]  I'm very good.  Oh, man.  Very good.  Keep rocking, Louis.  You're the best, dude.  Thank you.  Thanks.  That song really helped me.  I'll tell you.  Yeah, Louis had to follow that today.  I really don't.  It cleared my lung.  It cleared my lung.  I gagged.  If there's anybody that can follow that, it's Louis Platt.  Thank you.  Thank you, Paul.  Hey, you guys rock.  Syndication now.  Yes.  Take care.  With songs like that, it'll be tomorrow. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  We've got to have them nationwide.  We have one more entry today.  I don't know if it's going to come close, but we'll give it a spin a little later.  I can't wait.  Well, Louis, what's it called?  Pre-teen vagina.  I think it's the new one.  Jesus Christ.  Did you see Louis look at me for a second like I was serious?  I'll ring the inappropriate bell.  Oh, man.  Oh, boy. 
[02:13:00]  Sarah on line four is sick to her stomach because of the song.  We played the song an hour ago, and people are still commenting.  Can you be sick to your stomach?  I don't know.  Want to ask her real fast?  Let's see.  All right.  Sarah?  Yeah.  Hi.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey.  You guys, I can't believe I have never had such a physical reaction to something on the  radio.  Physically sick and by our program.  Oh, my gosh.  I mean, I can feel it in my throat.  I could leave radio now.  That was my goal.  It's still there.  Physically sick and people.  I had to call because after all this time, it's still there.  Well, the bosses, you know, sat Aunt and I down and told us, you know, you guys really 
[02:13:30]  need to bring the women into your show.  Oh, yeah.  So we figured, you know, hitting the important issues.  We did it.  Oh, okay.  That's an accomplishment.  With a bang.  Man.  All right, Sarah.  Thanks.  All right, bye.  Thanks.  That's great.  Thanks for making me physically ill.  Physically ill.  If you can just show that you can't.  That's the best.  When a sound coming out of your speaker can make you physically ill.  Phenomenal.  Come on.  That's great.  That's what it's about.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:14:00]  You know, we're going to have a drug-free America.  This is the route.  Yeah.  You know?  We need, like, audio narcotics.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what it is.  I think you're coming close.  Well, you want to talk politics a little bit?  You must have some thoughts on what occurred the last few days.  What occurred is utterly the worst.  The worst case scenario is that we could spend $250 million and be nowhere.  Yeah.  You know, this is just the most...  We could have saved the money, right?  Yeah.  That song may be offensive, but what occurred, you know, with that, with what's occurring 
[02:14:30]  right now with just Bush.  Now we're left with the two of them.  That's offensive.  Of course I'm going.  I have lived on this planet this long to end up, and that's the best.  If that's the best we can do, give me a stick and I'm poking out my eye.  That's insane.  Look at that.  They're both so creepy.  One is out of a pod, and the other one is a family pod.  Yes, he's out of a pod.  I want to know where the pod is.  That, you know, Al Gore, Al Gore, worse than Al Gore when he was not peppy, is this new kind 
[02:15:00]  of...  Yes.  And I was, hello, happy.  Happy.  Hello.  It was messed up.  And it's like, when he speaks to that, it's like somebody's giving him an enema.  Dude.  Yeah, they told him.  Get excited.  He can't get excited.  He's like, he's socially retarded.  The other one is socially retarded, and he sits with that wife.  They look...  I'm walking into it, and I'm sitting side by side thinking, this is like at some handicapped  festival.  He's looking at, she's looking at, they don't even know how to look. 
[02:15:30]  They don't even know how to act natural anymore.  We're supposed to really, like, stomach this?  It's really good.  It is.  It's like, I've been in politics so long, you know, that you don't even know how to  act like a human being.  I would rather just get one of those robot dogs.  Is that what they do with the wives of these candidates that have to stand next to the podium  and give a Stepford wife a mon-friggin' heroin look at the husband?  Yeah.  Because McCain, his wife, looking at him, I swear to God, I thought at some point her head 
[02:16:00]  would roll right off her body.  It looked like she was on drugs.  Yeah.  Like she was drugged out.  Yeah, no, she does.  And that was the best.  The best thing yesterday was that McCain yelling at Maria Shriver.  Yeah, great.  That was great.  Get out of here.  Yeah, but you knew that.  But that's the thing.  There's the little, you know, that little snap box of McCain's nobody wanted to talk  about.  You see that and you go, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Because that's the other thing with him, you know.  He ran and I kept saying in the act, you know, the guy's in a North Vietnamese prison camp 
[02:16:30]  for six years.  Can we discuss that for a minute?  No, no, no, no, no, it's a hero, ha, ha, ha, you know.  Meanwhile, I had friends who went over there for a year and they're still like, you know,  their dragonflies come in the yard and they're, you know, they're hiding in the root cell.  So, I mean, let's get a grab.  You know, I mean, for crying out loud, just insane.  You know, for reasons of discussion, you have to bring it up. 
[02:17:00]  You have to bring it up.  What did you endure?  How did it affect you psychologically?  How do you think it's going to work on you?  And what do you think it means?  Well, we were hoping McCain was going to be our next president because we knew he would  snap eventually in the White House, you know.  And had a great line about the Rose Garden turning it into a rice pad.  I felt he would just rototill the Rose Garden, plant rice paddies, and just sit there with  maybe a mounted 50 cal out the side window of the White House and pick off a few of the  gardeners for all times.  A little revenge. 
[02:17:30]  That's perfect.  Oh, boy.  You know, if he got any further and he'd have to go on the campaign trail further, and you  know how they love kissing babies, I would love to see him in an Asian community pick up  a baby and just bite its throat out.  You drew first blood.  You drew first blood.  It wasn't me.  It wasn't me.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Gook babies!  Gook babies! 
[02:18:00]  Bring me the gook babies!  Gook babies!  Gook babies!  Bite its throat out!  I drew first blood.  You drew first blood.  Hey, put that to music.  I think we got another entry.  Wow!  Wow!  You drew first blood.  Oh!  Why did it be?  Ah!  I just started this.  You started this.  Gook babies!  Jesus! 
[02:18:30]  The new tune, Gook Baby, climbing up the charts on American Doppler.  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  I'm having an acid flash.  McCain just checked in.  He is supporting the fetus song.  Now, McCain did drop out today, right?  Yeah.  It was sort of a half-assed dropout.  He said, for now, you know, he's dropping out of the race.  I think he wants to run as an independent at this point, huh?  I think he's going to load up and try to kill Bush and jump back into the fray. 
[02:19:00]  That's what I think.  Yeah.  I just, uh...  I think, uh, he thinks maybe Bush might accidentally put himself in the electric chair.  No.  Kill himself.  And, you know, oh, no, I can't pardon myself either.  Yeah.  It was a paperwork glitch.  It says I have to be put to death.  Gotta do it.  I can't look weak.  Gotta do it.  Gotta do it.  Have to electrocute myself.  Gotta do it.  Oh, man. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, so we're left with them.  Gore and Bush.  Bush.  And now, Pat Buchanan, my other favorite.  A real personal favorite of mine.  The man, the only man who likes Hitler more than Hitler likes himself.  Oh, he's a swell man.  I really, you know, he's so misunderstood.  That's how he's gone off, yeah?  It always amazes me.  And on the road, I go, you know, you've got to bring it up.  I go, you know, I'm Jewish.  And then you can hear the hush come up and go, ooh.  He gets a little laugh, like, uh, uh, uh, uh.  But, you know, the guy is like, you know, what does he want? 
[02:20:00]  He gets to run?  You know, that's the best we can do for a third party is, uh, is him.  I mean, pick a cartoon character.  Anyone.  You know, clutch cargo makes more sense than that.  Yo, Zemite is saying it.  Ooh!  I love him.  He's perfect.  You know?  And he'd have guns.  Sure.  You know?  And then the NRA would have someone to really support.  And there's a group of, there's another group of, uh, sweeties.  Those guys.  You know?  But the, uh, but that thing with, uh, with Buchanan, Buchanan is, you see, uh, if you don't 
[02:20:30]  think that Pap Buchanan is psychotic, okay?  If you can't pick it up on your own with your own ears, go out and get a dog.  And when he's on, when Buchanan's on TV, put the dog in front of it and watch the dog  spin around in circles and try to bite its own ass.  And eventually it'll pee itself and probably pee urine.  And I'm just telling you.  So then that might change your vote.  He has that type of effect on, on the canine. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, yeah.  Anything.  Plants.  Plants, twitch.  Oh, man.  Wow.  All he needs is the little mustache.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  He almost looks the part.  Oh, my God.  You know?  And he's got that laugh.  He laughs.  Instead of going, expelling air, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, like a normal human being, he's  like...  That's actually sucking it in, which is actually what you're...  Hey, he's the third candidate.  Yeah, that's perfect.  So if you had any...  Oh, wow.  I mean, it's like, why...  You know, and now we've got months of this ahead of it.  Yeah. 
[02:21:30]  You know, this before was somewhat...  It's just begun?  It was somewhat interesting.  You know, it was somewhat interesting.  He said, Bradley might as well have just eaten his own body.  I don't know why...  The poor guy.  I really wanted him to make it.  Did he have a fashion consultant or some kind of a person that tells him how to look?  I know.  Look and act.  I mean, you know, it's like, come on, speak.  Speak.  Come on.  Say something.  You know, but he should have just literally...  He should have started...  The first state in New Hampshire, he should have chopped up his hand and just eaten.  And that would have been New Hampshire.  And then he got into the next state, South Carolina. 
[02:22:00]  Whack!  Take another chunk of his arm.  Eat that.  Until he was gone.  Until he was gone.  And I liked him.  Yeah.  I liked Bradley a lot.  But he came out of the slots with that big issue, health care, which everybody just leaps on.  Yeah, they jump on that one.  Oh, yeah, boy.  Because you know who really loves you?  You know, there's the people who really have a voice in this country, the people who don't have health care.  And people who do have it don't even want to discuss...  No!  No!  Screw you!  I'm fine.  Right.  I'm okay.  I'm paying enough already. 
[02:22:30]  I don't need to pay for anyone else.  I got my co-payment, you pig.  Get it.  Go.  You know, if you really cared, that job, you wouldn't be a temp, you little pig.  You know, you'd do something with your life.  It's unbelievable.  No health care in this country.  And then I love the fact, too, they...  You know, and so as a result, now health care is set back a hundred years.  Yeah.  You know, because now he's ruined it forever.  Pretty close.  Nobody's going to even, like, touch that issue at all.  And that's, like, stupid.  I mean, I don't have health.  The thing is, is, you know, for a long time I didn't have health care because I'm a comic. 
[02:23:00]  We don't have...  We got a union.  Yeah.  You know, what am I going to get together with Shecky Green and Malsey Lawrence?  We're going to discuss a deductible.  Oh, yeah, I know a deductible.  Two Jews went into a bar, honk, honk, quack, quack.  What does Tylenol cost?  I remember this.  It was a joke.  I used to do Tylenol in a Kentucky hospital.  They were selling Tylenol for, like, 50 bucks a pop.  50 bucks a pop is when, you know, you get your bill and it would be Tylenol, $800. 
[02:23:30]  And you go, I thought, you know, maybe I should quit this and go down there and walk around the hall selling them two for 25.  Do we have to get you out of here, Lewis?  I'm good for another 25.  Nice.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a quick break.  Let everyone breathe.  If you want to talk to Lewis Black about anything that's going on on the news, we'll get it.  That's our political thing there.  We'll move on to some of the other stories that have hit the news lately.  We'll come back with Gook Baby Killers.  Right.  Ah, you're darned it, it wasn't me. 
[02:24:00]  Gook Baby, come here.  Give me the Gook.  Give me the Gook Baby.  Give me the Gook Baby.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Lewis, the plug for your show once again.  I would give you your plug, but it's not written down.  It's no problem.  It's just...  What the hell?  It's not biting the throat's out of Gook Baby.  Gook Baby Killers.  Gook Baby Killers.  Gook Baby Killers. 
[02:24:30]  Gook Baby Killers.  Gook Baby Killers.  Gook Baby Killers.  Wow, that cleared my sinus.  I'm at the Stress Factory in Haiphong.  I'm at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick.  The 9 at 8, the 8, the 11 tomorrow.  And then my...  I don't know what I'm doing Saturday.  I may just lie on the tracks and wait.  Hope the dream train comes by.  Just a small patrol boat ride up the Mekong. 
[02:25:00]  Lewis, a very funny guy.  Check him out at the Stress Factory.  Give them a call for ticket info, all right?  Yes.  And we'll be back with more of Lewis Black in just a bit.  Let's all breathe.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, stupid.  Wow.  Boo, boo, boo.  More stupidity on the way.  Hey, Anthony. 
[02:25:30]  Yes, Rockaway Bedding.  We love Rockaway Bedding.  I use it.  I have a Rockaway Bedding bed in my bedroom.  They have 130 stores all throughout New York and New Jersey featuring brand-new mattresses,  Sealy, Serta, and Mines, the Stearns and Foster, up to 65% below department store regular prices.  Rockaway Bedding, you know what they do for you?  They give you a free steel bed frame with your bed,  free delivery, and here it is, free removal of your old, stained, disgusting mattress. 
[02:26:00]  Now, you know what?  I hope when either George W. or Gore get into the White House, they call Rockaway Bedding.  So Rockaway Bedding can haul away Clinton's old, disgusting, yellow, stained mattress.  Because how embarrassing would it be if all of a sudden you see George W. Bush or Al Gore  dragging this disgusting, putrid, stained mattress onto Pennsylvania Avenue  to wait for the garbage men to pick it up?  You know what that's like when you drive past a house that has a car up on blocks 
[02:26:30]  and there's an old mattress out in front?  And it's just...  Imagine what Clinton's mattress looks like at this point.  It has a crater in the middle of it from Hillary's butt.  It looks like someone dumped a load of Dunkin' Donuts Bavarian Cream Donuts all over it, I'm sure.  I would have to think.  And then those two huge imprints of Hillary's ass way on one side of the bed,  whale stains way on the other.  Probably some cigar juice from things I don't even want to think about. 
[02:27:00]  But Rockaway Bedding comes to your house.  We'll get rid of the old mattress.  Gets rid of everything you want.  No matter what it looks like.  Anything.  Okay.  Speaking of Foster, I think they got rid of him, too.  Hald him away, yes.  Oh, wow.  There's something under the bed, maybe.  They can haul away.  Come on.  You can shop at one of Rockaway Bedding's area stores or call 1-800-TRY-A-BED.  That's 1-800-TRY-A-BED.  Rockaway Bedding, the best and friendliest place to get your brand,  your new brand name mattress with the best prices and free services. 
[02:27:30]  Rockaway Bedding is the official provider of mattresses for Anthony.  And our buddy, Jay Moore.  Rockaway Bedding.  You guys, sometimes, piss me off, okay?  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Hanging with our buddy, our pal, Lewis Black, from The Daily Show on Comedy Central.  Check out Back in Black every Wednesday.  Lewis does a great job with that.  And Lewis Black playing the Stress Factory tonight, Friday and Saturday in New Brunswick, New Jersey. 
[02:28:00]  8 o'clock show tonight, and one show tonight, Lewis?  One show.  And then you've got an 8.30 and a 11 o'clock show, Friday and Saturday.  Call the Stress Factory for ticket info, but we highly recommend you go see Lewis Black, okay?  Hell yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And Joe Lyons just called from Comedy Central, so I keep forgetting.  Because I'm really Mr. Plug.  It exhausts me to think about it.  So, ComedyCentral.com, which now has a new video of me. 
[02:28:30]  I do, it's the Comedy Central website, and now I'm doing videos about the campaign.  So, they put me on, so that my head is about the size of a pin.  You can watch me flap my bird-like wings.  Isn't it great to be on the same medium that just shows, you know, ox having sex with women?  Exactly.  You know?  You could just one click away, there's Lewis doing insightful, funny, cutting-edge comedy about all kinds of things.  One click away, there's a woman doing a goat. 
[02:29:00]  Well, that's on page three of the Comedy Central.  It's actually me doing the goat, but you've got to go to the webcast to really find me.  There's some secret passages, and eventually you'll hear the goat.  You'll hear the goat.  ComedyCentral.com, see Lewis doing a goat.  I bet I'm Joe Lyons, will call back.  That is the way you're supposed to do that.  What is the matter with you?  Nobody's going to go there now.  All right, a lot of people want to talk to Lewis Black.  212-757-1027 if you've got something that's in the news that you want Lewis to comment on. 
[02:29:30]  What, do you want to go there?  I want to know what I said that pissed him off.  Nicky!  Nicky!  Yeah?  Nicky, what's the problem?  You're mad at Anthony because of the Vietnam comments.  Yeah, no, you know, I don't dig it, man.  You know, it's like O-Hole and A-Hole and everybody's an A-Hole, you know?  Well, what upset you?  Were you guys there?  What'd you do?  Where were you doing?  In the Nam?  I had a cool New York Jets jersey on and I was going to elementary school. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, pretty cool, huh?  No, I'm just...  Now it's a big goof.  Oh, it's a big goof?  Was I goofing on the Vietnam War effort?  Yeah, no, I don't dig the goof on the Nam, man.  What did I goof on?  I was goofing on the Nam.  I was goofing on McCain.  We never said the war was a goof.  You know what happened to McCain?  He spent five and a half years in that.  I had an opportunity to leave.  He broke his arms and he broke his shoulders, you know?  We've discussed that part of it, too, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, we have.  Well, you didn't give enough attention to it, man. 
[02:30:30]  Well, you can't do a setup and discuss that and then go with that.  It's not a joke!  It's that simple.  The whole thing's a joke, right?  No, it's not a joke.  You don't get the fact that the bottom line when it comes to humor is every so often somebody gets hurt sometimes.  Yeah, right.  I do.  I do get the bottom line.  Okay.  You know what?  I listen to Stern, do his goofs, and I listen to you guys.  And you know what?  It's also like, you know, really peed me off.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Nicky.  Okay, Rambo.  All right. 
[02:31:00]  Thank you, Nicky.  Yeah, die.  All right.  Okay, that's a beat.  Opie and Anthony.  Die.  N-E-W.  Take a promo out of that.  Eugene!  Yo!  What's up, Eugene?  What's going on, boys?  We're hanging with Lewis Black today.  Yeah, I heard that.  Yeah.  Let me ask Lewis a question.  What did you think about that stupid bitch, Kathy Lee?  And I'm leaving the show.  I'm going to reach the kicker right in the ass one day.  But I think you just saying, calling her a stupid bitch in the way you just did really 
[02:31:30]  made my week.  Because I can't even get to that kind of voice you've got to really, to get up to your body.  I think she's just another proof that, you know, why didn't she marry the millionaire?  That would have been perfect.  Yeah.  You know?  And then, did you know she's doing this movie with her kid?  Oh, yeah.  She's dragging her kid into a movie.  Have you seen the clip?  No.  Have you seen the clip of Cody yet?  No.  Have you?  No.  The acting is horrendous.  I'm sure it is.  And he looks like a fruit in waiting. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  I've got to say, yeah.  He's a fruit swore to become.  He's moments away from, you know, and he's got no.  And he's like, that's it.  He's there.  If anybody could write a How to Make Your Son Gay book, it would be.  Kathy Lee.  Everything she's done is a step-by-step thing to get your kid to grow up gay.  And I'm really glad that she's leaving that show where at least we have her contained.  Apparently she's in a box.  Now she's going to branch into her other things.  Yeah, to give her time for other things. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, that concert tour, that opportunity to be on Broadway, movies.  Yeah, sure.  Because she's such a great singer and actress.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure she's just going to flourish after she leaves that TV show.  Oh, man.  Does she know the love boat isn't on the air anymore?  Well, it will be now.  Any gig that she would get.  Oh, Jesus.  You are disgusting, Psycho Mark.  He comes in with jokes about Cody.  Cody will be a Peter Popper. 
[02:33:00]  What does that even mean, Psycho Mark?  Oh, no.  He's going to be flaming.  His wrist is going to be limp.  Okay.  He's going to be pulling worms out of the ground.  I saw that clip, though.  He is.  What a Peter Popper.  Yeah, it's unbelievable.  Even in the picture, you can hear him lisp.  Now, Kathy Lee is saying that sex, her and Gif have had, like, sex is the way that they  got their marriage strong again and the trust back with Gif.  If you remember, when Gif had sex with that woman in the hotel, what was his favorite kind 
[02:33:30]  of sex to have with her?  The back door, the balloon.  Why not?  I'm thinking Kathy Lee didn't want to give it up.  Now that he strayed and then came back, she had to make some concessions.  I'm thinking maybe now Kathy Lee takes it in the dumper.  Yeah.  And that's probably why she's leaving the show, because she can't sit for an hour straight  anymore.  In the balloon dot.  Gif tagging her.  All right. 
[02:34:00]  Let's go to data.  You be the center, and I'll play quarterback.  Data.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up?  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Louis, you're great.  Thank you.  Speaking of the millionaire, what do you think about this Darvichick?  Has she fulfilled her 15 minutes of fame yet, or do you think she has a little time  left to go?  Well, her brother died the other day, so I had to hear about that.  You know, that's what I really wanted to do.  Now that I've got her in my face, then I've got to hear that she's got a brother with  cerebral palsy.  I've got to wake up and read that with coffee.  What does that have to do with anything? 
[02:34:30]  And then I've got to think about people with cerebral palsy, which is terrible.  You know, but it's like, what are you?  It's disgusting.  And what is she thinking anyway?  You know, why don't they just, they should have brought her on, and they should have just,  you know, an interviewer, an adult come out and slap her.  Okay?  Somebody, like, in their 60s, who goes, what is the matter with you?  You're in your early 30s.  You are troubled.  And they just whack her a couple of times.  And then, so you have anything to say, and as soon as she opens her mouth, hit her again. 
[02:35:00]  It's appalling.  It's, you know, and then I said, but I'm thinking of Rick Rockwell may be the guy running for  vice president.  Yeah.  You know, he's got almost enough credentials now.  He's a jackass to the hundredth power.  And why not?  And what about how to find a vice president?  And do that.  Have him stand out there and have 50 people.  And then ask a couple of questions.  And we'll cut it to 10.  Ugh.  Well, my dream ticket would be Gore and Clinton as vice president. 
[02:35:30]  And then Gore resigns day one.  We get more years of that funny son of a bitch, Bill Clinton, in office.  That would be unbelievable.  I wonder if there's probably something in the Constitution.  Leave it to Bill, though, to get around something like that.  I want another four years, God damn.  I don't care what I got to do.  He said today, his approval rating is at 67%.  Because he hasn't done a goddamn thing in a year.  At least a year.  Yeah, he's done nothing. 
[02:36:00]  French, you're next on N.A.W. with Louis Black.  French?  French.  Oh, Frank.  It says French.  Hey, Frank.  Sorry.  Sorry about that.  It's the entire French nation.  It's Spaz.  He can't spell Frank.  Now he's changing your name on the screen to Frank.  Thank you, Spaz.  All right, go ahead.  Talk to Louis.  Louis.  I got to ask you, what do you think about the cause?  Hey, that was a good story, Bill Cosby.  I miss that.  Invited some 20-year-old actress that has done some work on his show, non-speaking parts, 
[02:36:30]  to his apartment in New York for dinner to discuss her career and how she can advance her career.  Acting advice, right.  Turns out she calls the cops because Bill Cosby at one point took her hand and shoved it down the front of his sweatpants.  And he was, I'm sure, allegedly.  Well, that's what the report said, what the police report said.  So, yeah, now, of course, she's suing and stuff.  But, you know, I'm not a big fan of Bill Cosby. 
[02:37:00]  But you've got to question what she's doing, if she's spending hours at his private place.  Well, it may have been a punchline to a joke.  We don't know.  You may have said, you know, he may have said, you know, you know how they say black men have really big ones.  Well, you know, here, boom.  And then, you know, whatever the setup was, and the punchline was his penis.  You never know.  Well, you do.  You work with audiovisual aids sometimes.  Or maybe when she asked, what was your inspiration for Fat Albert?  Yeah.  And he just wanted to show her. 
[02:37:30]  Fat Albert and the Cosby.  And then, what are you thinking?  What is she thinking?  You know, I'm going to go, oh, yeah, dinner and drinks with Cosby by himself.  Yeah.  You know, what are you thinking?  What could possibly, oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure he's going to discuss that with me.  I'm sure what we're going to do, he'll bring out the Stanislavski book.  Yeah.  And we'll talk about acting.  Well, obviously, she got caught up in the whole thing.  Thinks he's really Dr. Huxtable for something.  And, no, he's just a horny old man.  Yeah, he is.  It's like, has a 20-year-old in his apartment, and he wants to get a little. 
[02:38:00]  But the thing I think about Cosby is, you know, that's what he needs, but he really needs  his more money.  Because I don't think he really has enough cash.  You don't think, huh?  No, it's unbelievable to me.  You know, I just think he should have another show, and probably he's got, you know, a website  where we just sent him money.  I don't think he's got enough cash.  And now, obviously, he's collected all the cash, and now he's looking for hoochie-coochie.  Sure.  All right, let's go to Brian.  Brian, you're next on WNAW. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, I just wanted to know, why Mike Tyson picked up Katie Couric?  I don't have my bullhorn.  Yeah, we don't have the Mike Tyson bullhorn today.  Sorry.  No props here today for the bullhorn.  How about Lewis?  Did he hear about that?  What?  You mean Mike Tyson and Katie Couric?  Yeah, the Katie Couric and the...  Oh, we talked about her getting the pipe already.  The ass exam.  Yeah, we did.  We went through that.  Laying on her side as she was right on camera.  Even as I discussed it, there was a smell in the air.  Oh, God.  That was Stanton. 
[02:39:00]  John, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Owen?  How are you?  I was wondering if you guys heard about Magic Johnson.  Yeah, we were going to talk about Magic Johnson, yeah.  Here's another guy who can't get enough puss.  What did he do?  He can't get enough.  He had a girl come into his hotel room to give him a massage.  After like three hours of massage, she claims that he grabbed her, fondled her, and deep tongue kissed her. 
[02:39:30]  And now she's being age-tested and suing him for untold amounts of cash.  Again, why are you in a hotel with Magic Johnson for three hours and get in a position where he's going to thrust his tongue down your throat?  Man, oh, man.  And she was just wearing a T-shirt.  Just a T-shirt.  Just a T-shirt.  Wonderful.  What are you expecting?  You know, no sympathy here.  Magic Johnson is known, known to be a womanizer.  I mean, you've got to know it.  That's how he got the AIDS.  Yeah, really. 
[02:40:00]  You know something?  Heterosexual sex, causing AIDS, giving AIDS to men, is not as high as some other groups, let's say.  You've really got to beat the odds on that one.  You've got to make it up in quantity.  And that's what he does.  He's a womanizer.  And now she finds herself in this hotel room, and now she's freaked out because he tongue kissed her?  You put yourself in those situations.  What did she say?  Well, you know, I'm going to come up, I'm just going to wear a T-shirt, but no kissing.  No kissing. 
[02:40:30]  No, no, there won't be any of that.  And if there was ever anybody that looked healthier after getting AIDS, it's Magic Johnson.  For the love of God, what is this guy taking?  It's really like, it's unbelievable.  The guy gained weight after he got AIDS.  And got a TV show.  And got a TV show.  Oh, yeah, boy, yeah, that's it.  You know, he played basketball, and now that he's got AIDS, let's let him talk.  The worst talk show ever.  Oh, yeah.  Ever, ever.  All right.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Hey, guys, love the show. 
[02:41:00]  Thank you.  What does Lewis think about Daryl Strawberry?  Good Daryl Strawberry is, you know, there, you know, I think we ought to give him 100 more chances.  I think first up, he should play until he's 55.  I think we keep bringing him back, see what other drugs he wants to do.  You know, because God, he's got a problem.  It's like, at what point you just go, that's, no, sorry, can't, right.  You don't get to go to the till anymore, okay?  You got, you were sitting at the, the big money pit was there.  Now you got to come up with something else.  Go, now you're stuck. 
[02:41:30]  Now you're going to be a born-again Christian, you little pig.  And wander through the South from church to church, whining and complaining and putting out the little, you know,  your little thing and asking for a couple of bucks and write your book about how you met Jesus.  And he said, oh, is it me or is it crap?  And then I had my revelation.  And then he can go.  He can do a church a week.  He can be like I am.  I go from village to dell to every comedy club of magic.  Well, let him say, wander around like some moron.  Yeah, you know, you got to have a break in the world. 
[02:42:00]  And you just, you know, okay, well, if cancer is not going to get you to detox, what is?  You know, you got, God just sticks it right up your kazooter and goes, okay, I'm going to kill you.  And you go, okay, well, I'm going to have some more coke.  Okay.  There's not even a moment of it.  It's, you know, I think I'm just, I'm speechless when it comes to you.  I love when you get to that point. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, man.  I think we have time for one more here.  Peter.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  I like your show a lot.  Hey, thanks.  I was wondering if you had heard a story yesterday about a fender bender where a lady had rear-ended a guy,  but it was really not a big deal.  But he became so enraged that he got out of his car, went over to her car, grabbed her dog,  and threw it into oncoming traffic.  Whoa.  And killed the dog.  This is a huge story in California, right, Peter?  Yep, that's right.  Yeah.  This guy got.  Do you think that's justified?  Justified?  Wow. 
[02:43:00]  I'm only kidding.  Someone write a song about that.  The contest is still on.  Most offensive song.  What happened?  Where?  In L.A.?  Yeah, what happened was it was a little road rage incident.  Was it in L.A.?  Yeah.  I believe so, yeah.  Okay, then I think that's remorse of law and shut it down.  Shut the whole city down, and that's what I feel.  I drove there about a week ago, and no, they should shut the whole place down.  It's insane.  Really, and force those idiots to walk, okay?  He's the one.  He's snapped.  The whole class has to stay after.  No one gets a car. 
[02:43:30]  You've got to go from place to place by foot, like in the old days, you little pigs.  If you don't know how to drive a car, and your concept is, I'm going to drive for 16 hours  a day, and you can't do the privilege well, the whole class is punished.  That's the way it works as far as I'm concerned.  They can go to hell.  I was driving two hours a day.  They're psychotic.  They are psychotic.  It is insane to drive out there.  You know, we have our Long Island Expressway, and sure, that's complete madness, but it's  just a part of the chunk here.  This is like forever.  Four to five hours of driving, and you're still in the same place. 
[02:44:00]  That's true.  That's true.  When you drive two hours, you should be in another state.  And try to get over six lanes of traffic to get to your off-ramp.  Yeah, that's the good one.  They announced, you know, about 30 seconds beforehand.  Yeah, yeah.  Now you've got to go six lanes over.  Was it a poodle or something, though?  Did you guys get the details on this?  It was a little fender bender.  All right.  The guy has road rage, and the lady's sitting there.  She rolls down her window.  The guy starts screaming at her, and her little poodle or whatever jumps on her lap.  The guy grabs the dog and throws it.  Wow. 
[02:44:30]  That is pretty heinous.  Well, he may have had a poodle that got in his face in the past.  Well, you know something?  He had a little winky in his face when he was a kid.  Oh, it looks like a bichon.  A bichon frise.  One of those lap dogs.  Oh, my goodness.  And then they've got to show the picture of the dog.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Look, the dead dog, yeah.  The dog has died, you know.  But the services for Fluffy will be held.  It is a bichon.  Yeah.  My sister used to have one of those. 
[02:45:00]  I wanted to throw it into traffic.  I swear to God.  Oh, man.  Well, you know something?  She must have really done something bad for a guy to want to grab her dog and throw it into traffic.  I've been in situations where I want to throw the driver into traffic.  Yeah, probably driving with the dog on its lap.  Give mommy kisses.  Give mommy kisses.  Hey, mommy, drive through the green light.  Man, oh, man.  And then you get into a little fender bender and throw the dog out into traffic, huh?  That's unbelievable.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Hey, show up. 
[02:45:30]  All right, check this out.  Talk about traffic.  Yeah.  Two people having sex on the side of the road on the northern state, exit 32.  Are you serious?  In a convertible, in a Jetta.  Man.  In a Jetta, green car.  She's on top of his lap on the passenger side.  Northern state, exit 32.  They're just going at it on the side of the road.  Going at it.  She's wearing, she's wearing, like, one of those pants at tops, but, like, gray color.  She, beautiful, man.  Beautiful.  Can anyone else confirm that out there? 
[02:46:00]  How's the traffic just slowing down to a stop?  It was backed up.  It was backed up over there.  Yeah, sure.  It was backed up.  I'm like, what the hell's going on?  It's over here.  No way.  Usually when you're in traffic and you're waiting forever, you're just praying for blood and guts because you're so pissed off because you waited so long.  That's something I would say, okay.  I'm just going to pull over and join them.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  All right.  Bye.  Wow.  Sex on the side of the northern state tonight, exit 32. 
[02:46:30]  Sean, what's up?  Hey, how you doing all day?  You guys suck.  Thank you.  All right.  Just calling to say about second chances.  What does he think about Sammy the Bull blowing the chance that he got?  Man, can you believe that one?  He's got to be nervous.  Yeah, and then he had his kids doing it, too, which is good.  The whole family, the wife, the kids.  But with him, okay, at least with him, I get it.  Okay?  What else is he going to do?  Is he going to go, oh, boy, I just finished killing 300 people.  Now I'm going to paint.  It doesn't happen that way, okay? 
[02:47:00]  You know, this is what he does.  You got a point.  Sure.  He gets pulled back in.  He's a criminal.  And he was a career criminal.  I'm going to go paint.  He's in Phoenix, right, too, which is where they all seem to be.  Yeah, they all throw him back to Arizona.  They're always in Phoenix.  Which I think would drive me to, I would need ecstasy on a permanent basis.  I've got 118, which is really nice weather in the summer.  You know, it's nice if you want to bake a chicken on the sidewalk.  I'd be lying in my air conditioning going, you know, I'm going to have some more of that ecstasy. 
[02:47:30]  There's God.  Oh, wow.  Sammy the Bull.  Yeah, he's got to be a little nervous now, huh?  People know where he is.  Yeah, this is John Gotti looking for him.  Well, not John Gotti himself.  He's kind of put, he's indisposed at the moment.  Yeah, he'll probably go to trial and rat on his kids.  Yeah, knowing him, right?  To save his own ass.  Well, Lewis, it's up to you.  I've got to hit the road.  Yeah, I think you do.  I've got to go get on that rush hour on the New Jersey Transit. 
[02:48:00]  Yes.  A pleasurable part of this experience today will be going with those people who are, like, you know, sweating like pigs.  They're wearing their coats.  It started at about 30 this morning, and now they're just, they're, like, sweating and salivated.  It'll be just a treat.  I can't wait to get on that train.  Oh, boy.  Train that smells like a soup kitchen.  Well, we've got to thank Lewis Black for stopping by.  Always a pleasure.  He's at the Stress Factory tonight for an 8 o'clock show in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  If he can't make it tonight, he'll be there tomorrow and Saturday, 8.30 and 11 o'clock show. 
[02:48:30]  You got it.  Oh, I finally got it.  The phone number for the Stress Factory, we've got it here if you want to call us.  But it's 732-545-4242.  Lewis Black, thank you very much.  Thanks, guys.  Had a lot of fun.  And, of course, Comedy Central.  And ComedyCentral.com.  Dot com.  Whoa, thank you.  John, this is going to be happy tomorrow.  Please.  My video will be on it shortly.  Yes.  Okay, and I guess coming up next, Anthony, another entry in the Most Defensive Song Contest.  Oh, my God. 
[02:49:00]  I can't wait.  I'm waiting with bated breath.  We'll do that next.  Opie, you're a sick ass man.  Anthony, you're not a jackass.  You're obviously a star.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It makes me sassy.  1027 WNEW.  Opie and Anthony.  Are you in love with each other?  Yes.  We're homo.  Love gay people.  Love gay people.  Yes.  We're homo.  It's so easy to get guys naked.  Yes.  I think you have a lot of pent-up sexual frustrations.  Yes.  We're coming out.  We're gay. 
[02:49:30]  Hey, is this the homo and Anthony Show?  Yes.  Opie and Anthony.  Two guys who are not afraid to love each other.  We're here.  We're queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to it.  1027 WNEW.  Jesus Christ.  I burned that one.  That's the last time you'll hear that one.  That was the one we were playing when Jay Moore was here.  Yeah.  When the show was getting a little too gay.  Here, give this to production.  We're done with that one.  Oh, my God. 
[02:50:00]  Once again, I want to thank Louis Black for stopping by the studio today.  Very funny man.  I need a nap now, but yes, a very funny guy.  Yeah.  He gets rave reviews when he does his stand-up act,  and he's doing that tonight at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  8 o'clock show tonight.  If you can't make tonight's show, he'll be there Friday and Saturday, 8.30 and 11 o'clock.  Two shows.  Okay?  Cool.  All right, Anthony.  In the middle of the Louis Black segment, can't really call in an interview.  He's a pal, and he just kind of hangs. 
[02:50:30]  Sure.  Hangs on the show a couple times a month.  Someone called in about a couple having sex on the Northern State Parkway on exit, what,  exit 32, was it?  Yeah.  On the side of the road, and we're begging people to call in to confirm it.  We got Andy on the line.  Andy, what's going on?  I just saw it on the Northern State.  They were going at it.  He's found.  They were just pulled over on the side of the road.  Pulled over on the side?  Yep.  Going at it in a little green convertible.  And the top's down?  Top's down.  I hear the top's down. 
[02:51:00]  The girl has mounted the guy.  Yep.  Passenger seat.  Passenger seat.  How is he sitting?  He's just relaxing, reclining back.  Oh, and she's sitting on top of him?  Are people beeping at the guy or anything?  No.  I was just driving by.  They're causing a little bit of a traffic jam.  Is she naked?  No.  Not on the top.  Not on the top, huh?  No.  Maybe she has a little skirt on or something.  Wow.  Can you imagine 10-10 wins?  They have to report this?  Because they always report what the problem is up ahead and stuff, you know? 
[02:51:30]  I'd love to hear that one.  All right, Andy.  Thank you.  All right.  Take it easy.  All right.  Bye.  Traffic being backed up on the Northern State Parkway from my bandage point here above it.  Oh, there's a guy getting laid down there.  That's what it is.  Look at that.  The car is backing up here.  You've got quite a weight.  I don't know of any alternate routes, but I know where his route is right now.  Tell you the truth.  Wow.  Going at it.  Traffic backed up. 
[02:52:00]  A lot of rubbernecking going on.  That's just in the car.  Her neck looks like rubber the way it's bombing up and down.  Look at that.  Traffic on the ones.  That's what I call a traffic jam.  He's jamming her in traffic.  John, you're next at NAW.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  How are you?  All right.  Yeah, I checked it out.  I've seen it on the highway there.  You saw the sex on the side of the road, too, huh? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, it was crazy.  I thought you guys were starting up some new thing, like having sex wherever or something.  Well, yes, it is.  It's Have Sex Thursday.  Have Sex Thursday.  Have Sex anywhere you're damn well pleased Thursday.  Right now, we want all our listeners to stop doing what they're doing and have sex.  All you're going to see is people on the side of the highway having sex.  All right, John.  All right, man.  Thank you.  I guess it's happening, Anthony.  Yeah.  We need a brave soul with a car phone to stop behind them and get an interview, an exclusive 
[02:53:00]  interview with a couple having sex on the Northern State Parkway.  All right, well.  I'm power, John.  And, Anthony, you want to get back to the most offensive song contest?  Well, it is the kind of contest we're running here on our show, the most offensive song ever  written.  We've had some entries that have just been brutal, the last of which that came in from  Air Sick, the abortion song.  Don't even know what to say about it.  It is probably the most offensive song you'll ever hear.  Which officially is in the lead at this point. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The preliminary voting being in, it seems to be running away, with only a small percentage  of the precincts checking in, just running away with this thing.  It's really going to take an offensive effort to dethrone this song.  Yeah.  But I have faith in our sick, perverse listeners.  They'll come up with something that'll beat it.  So, we have another contender.  Oh, yes, we do.  Let me just see if this guy's real.  A guy that is walking behind the couple having sex. 
[02:54:00]  Pete.  Yeah.  Are you really near the couple having sex on...  Yeah, man.  I'm on the street, like, breaking floor 32.  All right.  On the northern street.  I'm walking right up to him.  Are you really?  Yeah, hang on a minute.  All right.  If anyone's in the area, please beep.  I don't know if this is...  I'm intending not to believe this.  But we will see.  Yeah, man.  Hold on.  They just looked at me. 
[02:54:30]  At a dump.  He's cursing.  No, I'm not cursing.  You said, what the F?  Oh, I did.  I'm sorry, man.  All right, man.  All right, Pete.  All right, later.  Good try.  Great.  All right, so, where were we?  Oh, yeah.  Most offensive.  Most offensive song ever written.  Started with full-blown AIDS.  And, boy, the people really picked up the...  Took up the challenge. 
[02:55:00]  Been writing some truly offensive and tasteless songs.  The Barry Manilow, most offensive song was in the lead.  Good one.  A lot of racism in that one.  A lot of...  A little of everything in that one.  Another one, how much is that darky in the window?  That was played earlier on today's show.  A little monotonous.  Repetitive.  Uh-huh.  But, very offensive.  And shocking.  And shocking.  Truly.  That was from Jeff, who calls himself Fuel, I believe.  Fuel.  Okay.  And then, Jesus Christ.  A song that...  Billy and Paul from Air Sick Productions checking in with what could be the most offensive song 
[02:55:30]  ever written.  The fetus song.  Kill a fetus.  Kill a fetus.  We were shocked, stunned, and thoroughly entertained.  And now, we have a new entry.  Yeah.  We have another entry from Fuel.  Oh, yeah?  Jeff.  Same guy?  Jeff, a.k.a.  Fuel.  The guy who...  Hedging his bets.  Sending in two.  Who wrote, uh...  How much is that darky in the window?  Well, hold on to your hats, people. 
[02:56:00]  All right.  Do you want me to...  I should give the name of the song, I guess, huh?  Uh...  I guess, uh...  You want to intro it?  Like, uh...  Like a CBS FM, Jack?  That's your gig.  Here we go.  I don't know the name of the song.  Oh, here it is, Anthony.  Okay.  Here it is, Harry Sack.  Harry Sack with your CBS FM.  This one coming in by a new artist, Jeff.  Ladies and gentlemen, on CBS FM, we premiere this song, Baby Raper. 
[02:56:30]  CBS.  Baby Raper by Jeff.  The other redmates think I'm kind of sick  Because of where I like to dip my stick  And how I always talk about the game 
[02:57:00]  I met that little hearty John's name  I wish that thing could somehow understand  I'm just a married, ordinary man  Who somehow they just can't seem to get 
[02:57:30]  While Maggie Simpson always makes me wet  Baby Raper  Baby Raper  I'm a Baby Raper  I'm sweet and young  They're good enough to eat 
[02:58:00]  Baby Raper  I'm a Baby Raper  I'm a Baby Raper  The youngest cherries  I always taste so sweet  I pick my dates up at the Disney store  I'm a Baby Raper  When Mommy turns away  I go for more 
[02:58:30]  Sing them songs  And tell them that they're sweet  Baby Raper  As I slip the little booties off their face  Baby Raper  Baby Raper  I'm a Baby Raper  Baby Raper  I'm a Baby Raper 
[02:59:00]  I'm a Baby Raper  I'm a Baby Raper  I'm a Baby Raper  Baby Raper  I'm a Baby Raper  The youngest cherries  I always taste so sweet  Baby Raper  I'm a Baby Raper  I'm a baby raper, so sweet and young, and food does not to eat. 
[02:59:30]  I'm a baby raper, I'm a baby raper.  Okay, terrific.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Oh, the phone.  Oh, my God.  That could just be cold and heavy to me. 
[03:00:00]  Whoa.  Oh, okay.  We got a contest.  Okay, Doug.  Yeah, we got us a contest now, don't we?  All right, listen.  We got a winner, Steve is saying.  We want the people to vote that have heard both songs today, or all three songs, I should  say, all right?  A lot of people coming in. 
[03:00:30]  I take it back.  This song beats the fetus song.  Get out of here.  Worse than the fetus song.  Oh, my God.  Just coming.  Ding, ding, ding.  Winner.  They're calling it the JonBenet song, unofficially.  It's definitely a toe-tapper.  All right, let's go to Antonio on line one.  Antonio.  What?  Anthony.  Hello.  Yeah, you're on the air.  Let's go.  No, that topped it off.  That topped it off. 
[03:01:00]  I'm sorry.  I just recorded the whole thing on my computer.  I recorded it on my stereo.  That's it.  And it's a toe-tapper.  Oh, yeah.  Have you heard all the songs today?  I heard them all.  And you think that's the one?  That's the one.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, by the way, I'm the guy who ate the Twinkies.  Oh, right on.  I remember you.  Yeah.  From the road show.  Cool, bro.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  We'll see you soon, all right?  Ding, ding.  Oh, sorry about that.  This year's Grammy for the most tasteless and offensive song going to Baby Raper. 
[03:01:30]  Effing sick, man.  Jeff has problems.  All these coming in like crazy.  Baby Raper, the worst song ever, ever.  Let's go to Phil.  Phil, you're next.  Phil.  It's Phil.  I got it wrong.  Sorry.  What's up, Phil?  I'm going to be singing this song all night long.  We were humming that all day before the show today.  Hey, I'm a baby.  I'm a baby.  I heard all three songs.  By far the best. 
[03:02:00]  Wow.  Wow.  I didn't think anyone was going to be air sick.  It's toe tapping, it's funny, and it's offensive.  All right.  What can you have?  Wow.  All right.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, you're next on NAW.  Hey, guys, end the contest.  It's over.  We got a winner, man.  But that's what you guys said about the song before this.  I don't want to hear it if it's going to be worse than that.  Really?  I don't want to hear it.  That could be the line.  All right.  Excellent. 
[03:02:30]  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  All right, man.  Indication yet?  Oh, sorry.  I don't think that, I didn't think there could be anything that beat the fetus song, but  holy ass, this does it.  Winner.  Baby rager.  I didn't mind hearing this song.  I minded hearing the abortion song.  Well, they're offensive in two different ways.  I think the fetus song more disgustingly offensive.  But this song, just wrong.  Just completely wrong.  All right, let's go to Craig.  Craig, you're next.  Third round TKO.  This one just took it on the chin. 
[03:03:00]  Wow.  Okay.  Wow.  By far the most hilarious song I've ever heard before in my life.  Funny.  People are thinking it.  See, look at this.  Baby rager.  The most vile, cruel, sick, and funniest song I've ever heard.  You know, he had the emotion down, too, you know?  It's a total.  You will find yourself.  You'll wake up three in the morning.  Baby rager.  Yes.  I'm a baby rager.  Again.  Again.  Again.  Again.  Play it again. 
[03:03:30]  Play it again.  Play it again.  Play it again.  Play it again.  Wow.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let's talk to the songwriter.  Jeff, a.k.a. Fuel.  Jeff.  Hey, guys.  Look at this.  A standing ovation.  Your first entry, how much is that darky?  In the window.  Didn't get, you know, great reviews, but, man, the second one, the follow-up track. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah, sometimes the first song they put out isn't really the hit.  Yeah.  I should explain, though.  A B-side hit.  My original entry was supposed to be Baby Raper.  Yeah.  In the middle of writing it, I got the idea for the other one, so I decided, what the heck,  let's write that one and throw it on there, too.  Oh, my God.  It was always all about Baby Raper.  Well, it was always all about Baby Raper.  Well, at this point, not all the voting's in, but it looks like you're taking over the  fetus song.  You're climbing.  You're climbing. 
[03:04:30]  I don't know what else.  I was afraid that I was going to have to top the fetus song.  I was afraid of what I might do.  Yeah.  I was frightened for myself.  All right.  Fuel.  Brian, Staten Island, Baby Raper, winner by knockout.  They are loving this song.  The ultimate offensive song, and it has a melody.  Grammys, here we come.  It's aversive.  That's the best thing.  Chris.  Somebody might lay in bed tonight singing that to themselves makes me crack up.  Baby Raper made me crap my pants.  Look at that.  That's something for the album cover. 
[03:05:00]  A little promotional sticker.  We might have to put a couple of these songs on our next CD.  Cool.  Baby Raper is stuck in my head faster than Karma Chameleon.  Does it beat We Deliver Keggers, though, as a catchy tune?  As catchy?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It rivals that as a catchy tune.  I'm just scared to check the mail tomorrow, Anthony.  Oh, fucking God.  Let's talk to Kevin Fuel's brother, I believe.  Oh, no.  Kevin.  You sick F.  Uh-oh.  Memo to self. 
[03:05:30]  When I have kids, bring them to daycare.  Hey, dude.  Mom's proud, my friend.  Mom's very proud.  I bet.  This is all I ever want to do is make my mom happy.  Hey, Kevin, did you think your brother had it in him to, you know, write lyrics like this?  Well, I always thought so, but I kind of always put those thoughts to the side.  Yeah.  But I guess in the end.  All right.  We might have to have Jeff, a.k.a.  Fuel, at our next road show to sing that live.  I can see 1,400 people doing it.  Oh, my God.  Baby Raper. 
[03:06:00]  I'm a baby Raper.  Wait.  I hope you didn't mind me throwing in the baby crying over it in some of the key parts.  That's classic.  I was helping out.  A little assist.  I'm like a mix master.  Yeah, we're like Fat Boy Slim.  Yeah.  Remixing stuff.  Boosting it up a little.  Okay.  That's cool.  Well, Kevin and Jeff, I guess we've got to let you go, but Jeff, it's almost safe to  say that you're in the lead as far as the most offensive song. 
[03:06:30]  All right.  Well, if anybody beats me, I'm just going to have to, I don't know, drink or something  to come up with something worse.  All right.  There's just a knockout blow.  Unexpected coming in because everyone thought the Fetus song was a runaway winner and that  was it.  Now, I mean, this is just getting rave reviews.  Can I just say one thing to my brother?  Yeah.  Jeff, you've always been my big brother.  I've always looked up to you.  You righted me when I was wrong, but I've never been prouder.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  See you later, guys.  All right. 
[03:07:00]  Later.  Not only offensive, but you can hum to it.  Jim checking in.  People enjoying it.  David, you're next on NAW.  What did you think of the song?  That is the funniest damn thing I've ever heard in my life.  And the sad thing is that about 3.30 in the morning, I'm going to wake up and I'm  going to be hearing that and Karma Chameleon in my head.  Yeah, you're going to be taking that middle of the night leak and you're just going  to be there.  I can walk for the next three weeks.  I mean, I'm at work and I just got my Walkman back on in time to hear that thing and I  almost had a hemorrhage.  People walk by my workstation and they're like, what the hell are you rapping at? 
[03:07:30]  I was like a freak.  I'm in here with one headphone in one ear, passing out, like trying not to have a stroke.  Wow.  And putting the baby sound in there?  Yeah.  Brilliant.  Okay.  Look at this email coming in from all the way.  Thank you.  All the way from Boulder, Colorado.  My daddy used to sing me to sleep with that song.  Mel, you're next on N.E.W.  Hey, guys.  That was the sickest effing thing I've heard.  I almost pissed my pants at work.  I'm telling you.  I thought the fetus song was good. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  Just beat them all.  Very surprised at the voting.  I didn't think anything was going to beat the fetus song, Andrew.  Yes, very surprised, but if anything should, this one should.  It could be the most offensive song I've ever heard.  All right, Tom, real fast, what do you got?  Guys, stick the fork in me.  I'm done, man.  That was it.  I just got off the Pensy Pike onto the Jersey Pike.  Yeah.  Heard that.  I was, oh, man.  I'm driving all over the road.  It's great.  Now, you heard.  Brought me memories back about being in the Marine Corps with babies and stuff. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, my God.  And you heard the other entries, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  The darky one, that one, he emptied himself.  All right.  I don't even know how to explain it.  All right.  Thank you.  Guy.  Sorry, sorry.  A couple more and we'll move on here.  Eric, what's up?  Not much, man.  I got to vote for the fetus song.  I think the baby rapist song was right on.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Dude, that song was out of control.  All right.  Yeah.  You like the baby rapist song.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Scott. 
[03:09:00]  Just a couple more here.  We got to make sure the voting is unanimous.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Man, that song should be on the Country Music Award.  Really?  That is one of the sickest effing songs I've ever heard in my life.  Pretty nasty.  All right.  Oh, man.  That is brutal.  All right.  That blows the rest of the field away.  Thank you, Scott.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Play it again.  Play it again.  Play it again. 
[03:09:30]  Play it again.  Play it again.  Wow.  Play it again.  Play it again.  Play it again.  Play it again.  Play it again.  Play it again.  Wow.  Play it again.  They're loving it.  Play it again.  Play it again.  Play it again.  Sing it!

Bring that soap, kid. 
[03:25:30]  I can't even know.  Hey, do you have a preference for soap or shampoo?  Not really.  I just, no, not really.  No, huh?  Okay, well, I got contacted by somebody at Lever, who was listening to the show.  Lever, the official sponsor of Smelly Cat.  And they just, I got the package in my mailbox just now.  What is it?  It's a box of soap.  We need cool stuff.  We need, like, a bubble bath.  Yeah.  I'm sure it's included in there. 
[03:26:00]  Some scrub loofahs and stuff, so she can really get scrubbed down.  Maybe we can get some brillos.  An iron, like a metal brush.  Steel brush.  It's like a bath kit for Smelly Karen.  And I know what we should have done with Smelly Karen.  Put her in the back of a pickup truck and send her through a car wash.  Ooh.  That would have been awesome.  Word up.  Well, if the bath doesn't work, we'll try that next.  We won't give up on you.  No, not at all.  No matter how much you want us to. 
[03:26:30]  Our goal is to get you clean.  Oh, good.  All right, so tomorrow's going to be a big day.  What time are you coming in for your bath?  Uh, about 4 o'clock, but I have to be out of there at, like, 5.30 because I have to be somewhere sick.  I think an hour is plenty of time to...  That's good.  We don't want to be pruning now.  Now, if your boyfriend's going to be pissed, you've definitely got to, you know, keep him home.  Well, I invited him...  No, no, no, no, guys, always wreck the lesbian crap around here.  You know, I invited him to come, but he said he had to work, but it doesn't even make a difference because he doesn't get the station in where he works, so he's not going to even know. 
[03:27:00]  All right, yeah, but please, please don't have him come down here and wreck our parade tomorrow, okay?  Don't scrub the area where the smell is emanating from.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Karen...  You really don't want me to shout.  No, Karen, come in smelly tomorrow.  Okay.  I want it off the funcometer, kid.  I'll walk from my dorm to the station.  How about that?  How about jogging?  I want to see if you're able to offend O.D. with your smell.  Yeah, there you go.  Neighborhood he comes from, it's going to take a lot.  Oh, my man.  Come on, my man. 
[03:27:30]  Man, ain't no bell on this table.  Ding, ding, ding, bro.  Ding, ding, ding, goes to Charlie.  All right, Karen.  All right.  I guess we're done with you until tomorrow.  All right.  Tomorrow, big day for you.  All right.  We're going to try to get rid of your nickname.  Okay, yeah, right.  All right.  Don't bathe, Karen.  Yeah, she's got to come in raking, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  Can we make a run around the block or something, too? 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, she's got to run, like, from the dorm, son.  Put a milk dud in her butt.  O.D., O.D., let me tell you something, it doesn't take much.  My man, we're like that?  Oh, my Lord.  Everyone smelled it the other day, and no one was brave enough to say anything.  I told you, is this true?  Yeah, you know.  I know.  All right.  Let's play a quick round of what do we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Dennis from Newark.  Today, I learned that people listen to Louis Black for two reasons. 
[03:28:30]  His jokes are so funny, and number two, he's so on the edge, you expect a blood vessel to pop in his brain and kill him mid-ranting.  Very, very true.  Louis Black, very funny.  He's playing the Stress Factory tonight at 8 o'clock in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  If you can't make tonight's show, and we highly recommend you try to, he's got two shows tomorrow and Saturday, 8.30 and 11 o'clock.  Okay?  Stress Factory, New Brunswick, New Jersey.  O.D.'s checking out the picture, Anthony. 
[03:29:00]  We started the show with that picture today, man.  Like one eye's bigger than the other?  Yeah, you see that?  Well, let me let everyone in on it again, because the audience changes drastically.  He's holding up a picture of a girl right after the money shot, and it looks like she has a really bad colt.  Yeah.  They're laying down rail behind Nick, dude.  Laying down some track.  Yeah, that's something. 
[03:29:30]  She's got a...  I didn't notice the rest of the picture, because I just thought it was her face, but look.  There's some boobage and legs, and look at that.  Look what's on her leg.  There's some more.  Yeah, yo.  Like, it's all over her.  She got creamed, kid.  Yes, she did.  You were standing too close to the hose.  Looks like you beat her in the eye with it, though.  When it was turned on, man.  You can't look down that hose unless you know it's not on. 
[03:30:00]  The lost milk mustache.  All right, listen.  Tom from Jersey.  What I learned today on the O&A show, raping babies is worse than scraping them.  Jason from Jersey learned that O&A fans are the sickest and most creative creatures in the tri-state area.  Well, that's very nice.  We take that as a compliment.  Thank you.  All right, let's go to Damon.  Damon, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned how to perform an abortion.  Oh, God. 
[03:30:30]  Wonderful.  All right.  I'm playing again.  I've got an outlaw metal cold hangers in this state.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, you're next on NEW.  Hey, I learned that exit 32 on a northern state would be better than scores.  Yeah, it's better and cheaper than scores.  And cheaper.  Yeah, much cheaper than scores.  And I also learned if you're an outgoing president, you shouldn't eat Bavarian cream donuts with that.  We like the obscure ones.  Thank you, Steve.  How pretty.  Yeah, we had a couple having sex on the side of the northern state today. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  A couple more we've got to get out of here.  Tim?  Yeah, what's up?  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that tomorrow over 2 million people in the tri-state area are going to be humming baby raper.  Yeah, I believe a lot of people are going to be humming that in their sleep tonight.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Over and out, Diamond Dust.  Diamond Dust.  General, what's up?  Oh, hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  I learned that Gary Glitter should do a cover of Baby Raper on his next album. 
[03:31:30]  You guys got problems, man.  Yeah, we know that already, though, man.  All right, syndication now.  Burning hell tomorrow, guys.  All right.  Over and out, Diamond Dust.  Sounds like a plan.  Rich, what's going on?  I learned that my name was born.  I'm going to stay in the house until he's 10 years old.  I'm going to let him out the door.  I'm genius.  Yeah, it was.  You're going to lock your baby indoors.  Yeah, I think so, at least for a while.  All right, thank you.  Syndication now. 
[03:32:00]  All right, bye.  All right.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian?  Yeah, how's it going?  Good.  What's up?  I want to tell you what I learned today.  I learned that if you want to buy the sweetest cherries, you've got to go to the Disney store.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  We were just having a sock.  Guys.  Thank you, Brian.  Take care.  All right, let's go to Aaron.  Aaron, you're next on N.E.W.  Yo, what's up, guys?  How are you?  All right.  I learned that I forgot everything that happened in the show right after the baby raper happened.  Yeah, no doubt.  We had some great stuff before that, too. 
[03:32:30]  I also learned that the warm weather is pretty bad if you're listening to that song when there's a family of four next to you in a minivan.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Take care.  All right, bye.  See you.  Well, Anthony, I guess we could announce the results.  All precincts reporting.  I'm sorry to say, Billy and Paul, I know you're listening right now, but it's over.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah.  Oof.  You have been surpassed.  We didn't think it was possible today.  And that's it.  That's in the lead.  But baby fetus is... 
[03:33:00]  Baby raper.  Yeah, baby fetus is done.  The new leader in the most offensive song contest.  It's a whole new administration.  Baby raper by Fuel, a.k.a. Jeff.  We might have to leave the show with Killer Fetus.  Give it one last play.  One last minute of glory before we move on with the conversation.  We'll move on.  I learned that Earl can't get laid or do any work.  Bob from Jersey.  That goes way back to the beginning of the show.  Yeah. 
[03:33:30]  Dan from Stanford, Connecticut.  I learned that Satan is holding a special place in hell for Jeff, a.k.a. Fuel.  Fuel.  Fuel rocks.  He had better come to the next road show.  Fuel?  And perform that song.  Well, we're going to try to do a road show in early April or mid-April.  Could you imagine thousands of fans screaming, I'm a baby raper.  Baby raper.  We could have a bunch of these guys on stage performing their songs. 
[03:34:00]  Maybe we use the road show as the grand finale.  We have the finalists.  The awards perform live and the listeners who are there judge.  We take the votes here and then compile them with the live performance votes.  Yeah.  My man, that's amateur night, kid.  Come on.  That's not a bad idea.  That's not a bad idea.  Rip it off the Pano Theater.  I don't know if we can handle another three or four weeks of songs. 
[03:34:30]  That's true.  It's going to get ugly.  But, yeah, it's not a bad idea.  What we could do is get four people and then we'll wait for the next road show and then the listeners decide who wins.  We'll get finalists.  All right.  Is that chick going to show up at the next road show from the picture?  Atta girl, baby.  Hey, Ray, you're next on NAW.  Thanks.  So it looks like a thing of Elmer's glue blew up in our face.  Ray, you're on the radio.  Let's go.  Hey, I learned that Michael Jackson has an alias, Fuel. 
[03:35:00]  Very good, Ray.  All right.  All right, man.  Take it easy, guys.  You suck.  All right, man.  Thanks for all the great phone calls today.  Thanks for listening to us.  Thanks to Lewis Black for stopping on by.  Word up, man.  He's funny, kid.  Yeah, I've got to give him another plug because it's definitely worth it.  You're looking for something to do and you're close to the Stress Factory in New Brunswick,  New Jersey.  Lewis Black on stage at 8 o'clock.  You're going to laugh.  I'm telling you.  You're going to have a great time.  If you can't make it tonight, he'll be there tomorrow and Saturday for two shows, 8, 30,  and 11.  Yes.  And with that, Anthony, we are done-ski for the day. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, Don and Mike are next.  And, well, the runner-up thus far in the most offensive song contest, Kill a Fetus.  Oh, God.  By Billy and Paul.  We'll see you guys tomorrow at 2 for FU Friday.  I can't be a dad, you bitch, I've been had. 
[03:36:00]  Punch your stomach, dry pliers, they got stuck.  Your c**ch is bleeding, hangers in your uterus.  Don't stop your c**ch, I think I hooked the fetus.  Want to kill the fetus?  Just once, yank it out of their c**ch. 
[03:36:30]  Please, D&C, suck out little toes and knees.  Zack, Zack, Zack, can't be in the middle post rack.  Lose, can't juice, gonna pull it till it comes loose.  I'm used to the crazy people.  Oh, don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head. 
[03:37:00]  Are you mental?  No, it's our show!  I'm a mad man!  I'm getting hit!  You sound like a stark, raving mad person.  No!  Please, please!  No!  No!  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  No!  I'm a mad man.  How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?  1027 WNEW. </pre>
