<pre> A gigantic boombox is coming down the street.  Hand me the RPG-7.  Orly and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  I'll be in Anthony!  In my day, radio was boring all the time.  And we like it that way.  And tell that dirty Sanchez guy to take a bath!  Alright, we gotta get Spazz in here.  Yeah, quite frankly, he's gonna bore us here. 
[00:30]
 Gay boy!  Alright, so if you're faithful to the show, Spazz, who you've kept off the radio for a while now, thank God.  He finally completed his gay play run.  How many plays were there?  Five.  Five of this plastic.  I remember the first night you said, I don't know, you kind of had a scene where you had to lay in the bed with this guy. 
[01:00]
 He kind of put his hands through your hair.  And as the lights went dim, he made like he was going south to pleasure.  Yes.  That's the scene.  I knew we were supposed to be straight in this play, but I was supposed to be confused with your sexuality.  You had one gay experience before this, and now for some reason you're in bed with this gay guy.  Is this the play or his life we're talking about?  I'm confused now. 
[01:30]
 He's supposed to seduce me in the play.  Right.  And you're in his bed.  No, he's in my bed. He comes into my room.  So you have the homo-field advantage.  How did that come about?  How do you invite the gay guy back to your room?  I didn't invite him in.  The way the scene starts is that I'm in my bed sobbing.  I'm fighting not to cry because of the tragedy in my life.  And he hears that through the partition in the wall.  So he comes in and he... 
[02:00]
 Takes a temperature the old-fashioned way.  He pounds me down and he seduces me.  He uses the excuse that I want to know why I'm...  That's every day that I'm in bed and if someone's knocking at the door I just let them in and invite them into my bed.  It's a play, you know.  No coffee or anything?  I don't invite them in because it's just like a little thin wall with a little slide door.  He just walks right in.  Oh, he just came right in.  I walk into his bathroom. 
[02:30]
 Is this supposed to be your apartment?  It's supposed to be...  It was an old house in 1938 in New Orleans.  Alright.  And you're just living with gay guys.  No, one is gay.  The other one...  If he gets $100 he'll do it.  And you're supposedly this confused guy.  I'm the confused guy.  So now the gay guy's in your bed.  You have to talk about this because I know that a lot of listeners were happy about Spaz Free. 
[03:00]
 Oh, shit.  So you're in the bed.  And he's sitting on the bed with you.  Yes.  He starts, the actor, starts improvising a little bit on the scene.  Let's get this straight because basically you all agree that you'll do this gay scene but there's no touching, right?  Well, there's only two parts where he touches me.  One is when he runs his finger down my arm.  And the other part is when he puts his arm around my shoulders. 
[03:30]
 And you agree to that but no more for this play?  Yes.  But the actor starts improvising?  Yes.  What did the actor do to you during the gay play?  Now the first couple of nights he started improvising just a little bit.  Just a little bit.  So what was he doing then?  Well, instead of a finger he put his whole hand...  And rubbed down your where?  He rubbed down my thigh.  So he's rubbing down your thigh. 
[04:00]
 And then what was he doing?  You said something with... I don't know. What was he doing?  Wasn't he breathing?  Oh, yes. He nubbed my ear.  What?  He took my earlobe, like he held on to my earlobe, shook it a little.  What is he, Carol Burnett?  So he grabbed your ear?  He grabbed my earlobe, yes.  So he fingered your ear?  He didn't finger, he just grabbed down the earlobe.  So he had a hold of your ear?  Yes, your ear.  My ear, yeah. That's what I said.  So he gently fingered your ear. 
[04:30]
 Your ear, I said.  Your ear.  My ear.  Your ear.  He had his hand all over your ear.  Did he poke anything in your ear?  No.  He just grabbed onto it.  He just grabbed your ear.  And kind of flitted around with a finger.  Did it sound like my behind?  No, I'm saying your ear.  You're from New York. 
[05:00]
 This is how we talk.  Your ear.  He said your ear.  He fingered your ear.  He grabbed onto it.  He shook it with his fingers.  He kind of played with his fingers on your ear.  Yes.  On my ear, yeah.  That's what I said, your ear.  So was he blowing into your ear?  No, he didn't get that far.  Alright.  Did he tongue your ear? 
[05:30]
 No.  I got an ass.  No, he did not tongue anything.  Did he diddle your ear?  It's like saying here's a look at you kid type thing.  Would you consider it a diddle?  Did he diddle your ear?  What do you mean by that?  You know what a diddle is?  He just grabbed onto it and looked at me dead in the eye.  So he used two fingers? 
[06:00]
 He used two fingers.  Two fingers on your ear?  Yeah.  Wow, Spash.  That's all I could say.  So that was the first night of improvising.  Yes.  So now the next night, he gets a little more bold with you.  Well, I don't know if this was intentional or not.  But this is part where he's supposed to say shh, listen to the rain. 
[06:30]
 And I'm supposed to turn my head away and look out the fake window and look at the rain.  And when he's doing this, he's supposed to say I'm going to give you this to help you to sleep.  And he puts his hand underneath the sheets.  So it's supposed to be manually doing something?  No, he's supposed to be reaching for it.  How are you supposed to hear the rain if he's got a finger in your ear?  No, he just numbs it at the end of the eye. 
[07:00]
 So you're listening to the rain?  Yeah, I'm listening to the rain and he's moving his hand and he kind of nipped it.  Now wait a minute.  What? He nipped your schlong?  Ah, fag!  It was unintentional.  Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!  Dude.  What do you mean?  No offense, but at that point you break character and you punch it in the head.  I broke character in a different way.  I laughed a little bit.  Oh, you laughed? 
[07:30]
 Before you giggled like a little schoolgirl?  Giggled like a bitch, man.  No!  I left my ear!  I did not laugh!  No!  This is the way it happened.  Because I was not expecting it!  Did he touch your unit? 
[08:00]
 He nipped the tip.  Now, I'm not a fag!  He touched the tip.  He just brushed it.  He nipped it.  So you even know all the terminology.  Yeah, he nipped it.  And you giggled like a schoolgirl.  I didn't giggle like a schoolgirl.  How did you laugh? Give us a little laugh.  You broke character, what did you do?  I didn't laugh, I had this smile on my face. 
[08:30]
 What?  Wait, let me tell you something.  Player No Play, someone's touching my sling,  even if they nip into it,  that's not the look that's on my face.  The look on my face is...  It's not a big smile, right?  Let me just tell you why I had it.  Because I was not expecting it.  Because he has a tendency to play jokes around the...  Oh yeah, what a joke.  But the joke's on him, because you're not gay, right?  Yeah, sure.  And the look of pure shock on your face? 
[09:00]
 That's how I react to everything.  That's how I react to everything.  That's like my defense against...  My defense against everything.  No, uncertainty.  But he nipped it.  He nipped it.  Laughing is my defense against something if I'm not so afraid of it.  I can see you on Cell Block D, just giggling your ass off.  Like you're a new boy.  Hey, that's good.  Laughing is my defense against something.  Laughing is my defense.  He's tossing my salad. 
[09:30]
 No, look, I'm tossing salad.  It would never go that far.  Look at me.  Look, I'm taking...  It would never go that far.  Oh sure, so how far would it go?  If he nipped it?  He nipped it. I was not expecting it.  And things I get surprised that I laugh at.  So you laugh.  So now, moving on.  There was another instance where he is supposed to take his head and move it down towards your intimate area. 
[10:00]
 To simulate that he's having a non-pleasuring.  So at one point he gets so close.  Now Spaz, you are wearing nothing but flesh colored boxer shorts.  Yes, and what was he wearing?  He was wearing the European underwear with the outline.  European underwear with the outline.  What is that?  It's like the outline. 
[10:30]
 It's a speedo.  No, it's like the shape of your thing.  The back is like a thumb.  It acts like a speedo, yes.  Oh my god.  But it's underwear.  So this guy is obviously gay.  No, he's not.  Please.  He's a respected man.  Look, he's defending his boyfriend.  So are you trying to say that gay people aren't respected?  No.  You're one of them. You shouldn't put him down. 
[11:00]
 I'm not one of them.  I'm not making any accusations against anybody because he's a good friend of mine.  I asked if he was gay and you said no because he's a respected man.  Implying that gay people aren't respected.  I'm not going to make that accusation.  You just did.  We have a lot of gay listeners.  They're going to be pissed off at you.  I already said that I could be friends with a gay person.  Oh gee, you pretty much patted down with one.  I hope you could be friends.  He's not gay though. 
[11:30]
 Don't do the gay community a favor or anything.  I could be friends with him.  Gee, thanks.  So Spass, now you're wearing your boxer shorts.  And he's wearing his European little...  European suit or whatever.  Now I guess the front of the boxers has the normal hole in it.  Yes.  So as he does his little move where he moves south, he gets so close.  What do you feel? 
[12:00]
 Breath.  You feel hot steamy man breath on your unit.  There's a reason for that?  There's a reason for that?  The reason for that is that that particular night, that particular night the lights were  coming down really slow.  Yeah.  So he has to stretch the seams.  So what he has to do is he has to hold his position there.  Yeah, hold his position. 
[12:30]
 So how does man breath on your penis feel?  Yeah, how does that feel?  Hot steamy man breath.  It feels weird.  And what about razors?  What, you think I liked it?  Not once did I get excited.  You're going to do that again though, right?  No, that...  Man breath!  Man breath!  No, that...  No!  Little bitch laugh. 
[13:00]
 I do not laugh like that, alright?  I'm a man who laughs.  I need to be told something funny.  This stuff isn't funny?  What are you crazy?  At that particular time I had a look of confusion on my face because I was looking in the direction of the lighting person.  Oh, looking in the direction?  Oh, direction.  Alright, so let me get this straight.  You had a look of confusion because you were looking at the lighting director.  And that's why you were confused. It wasn't because there was man breath on your penis.  No, I was confused at two things. 
[13:30]
 No, actually because the slow lighting led to the man breath.  Hot steamy man breath.  1-900 calls.  Like I said, it probably was purely unintentional.  Oh, sure.  He couldn't just get far enough away.  No, because look, he had a simulator.  So he had to put the blanket up and he had his face like right there.  Was his head moving?  What?  Did you have your hand on the back of his head?  No, because he asked me to lean back and imagine the paratroopers. 
[14:00]
 So I had to lean back.  What?  Paratrooper.  The paratrooper was the first person I had a relationship with a long time ago.  Geronimo.  Pooper trooper?  Pull my cord.  Oh, spaz man.  You couldn't find a production of Oklahoma?  Oklahoma, yeah. 
[14:30]
 OP and Anthony.  1027, WNEW.  OP.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Anthony.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  Better leave a bruise.  1027, WNEW.  That's right.  It's the OP show today.  Screw Anthony, I don't need him anymore.  Where the hell is Anthony?  He's checking his stocks, isn't he? 
[15:00]
 That bastard.  All right, screw him.  We're going solo today.  Here he comes.  Loser.  You said two songs.  You said two songs.  I don't need you anymore.  You said two.  I don't need you.  I will not be doing a radio show with you anymore.  I thought that was the first song, OP. 
[15:30]
 That was the second.  Bush was the first.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Eric.  Glad I could make it.  Let's make believe we haven't talked to each other for the last three hours.  Yeah.  I had to turn Anthony on to the lesbian stuff from HBO.  Yeah, we're watching that in the office.  If these walls could talk.  If this gash could talk.  Yeah.  They replayed last night on HBO.  We got a tape. 
[16:00]
 I had to turn my buddy Anthony on to it.  Finally.  I heard a bunch of people talking about it.  I hadn't seen it.  Now I finally saw it.  Oh my God.  There was problems with the matching of the lesbians, right?  Yeah, definitely.  They needed Michelle Williams with Sharon Stone.  Right.  That would have been a hot lesbo scene.  But instead you get Ellen DeGeneres with Sharon Stone.  We're trying to figure out if that's Ellen DeGeneres' boob.  I think it is. 
[16:30]
 You really think that's her boob?  I think it was.  There were quick shots and one of her laying on her back.  So that was kind of weird.  You can't really tell firmness or anything by laying on her back.  Well, it looked like a little pancake.  And then one where she was kind of bending over Sharon Stone, like hunched over her.  And it was just hanging down.  Hanging side boob.  And it didn't look bad there.  I don't know. 
[17:00]
 It's amazing though.  I saw everything that everybody watched that show for.  And it took about a minute and a half.  Oh yeah.  The whole show, how long was it?  I think each vignette, I think they're called vignettes, were like 20-25 minutes long.  So you're talking a show, what, an hour long show?  Well, we got the tape and we just went to the lesbian scenes.  That's all we did.  And we didn't do the lesbian scene in the first one because they were old Lesbos.  I guess it was two old Lesbo broads. 
[17:30]
 We had no desire to check out that lesbian scene.  Geez.  Even I did not want to see that, Anthony.  You're proud of me?  Yeah, I know. Thank God.  Rick's like, oh, there's the old Lesbos at the beginning.  Oh, it's like, nah, no, thank you.  But, man, some of those scenes, pretty hot.  And then the other one they had, what's her name there, from Dawson's Creek?  Michelle Williams and Chloe or whatever her name is.  Oh God, that one is a man. 
[18:00]
 I know.  There's nothing worse than seeing a lesbian scene where one of the Lesbos looks like a man.  It was ridiculous.  But that Michelle Williams, well, that's not bad.  She was always a first Lesbo experience, I guess.  She's in the bed, she's getting her clothes peeled off, she's giggling.  That was hot.  She opens up, pulls the shirt up.  She's all timid and stuff, and the other girl just nails her hands down. 
[18:30]
 Yeah, hands her hand against the headboard of the bed.  Then she cups the right one a little bit.  And then with one hand goes right down, beef, to play What's in My Pants?  Squirming. That was pretty hot.  Pretty much like the scenes we've been seeing in the studio.  I want to be a lesbian for a day.  Yeah, on the Lesbo couch, for sure.  So what did you think?  It's all you liked, right? You didn't have to sit through the bullcrap storylines. 
[19:00]
 Yeah, I thought they were pretty hot Lesbo scenes.  But they didn't have that glazed donut look when they were done.  They were basking in the afterglow, and they were both completely dry.  All of them.  You know, the little... Come on. At least a little bit.  Eric, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Feeling. The field broads don't go out in the thing last night.  Oh, no?  Well, we didn't want to fast-forward through it to see. 
[19:30]
 We just assumed they were having old broad Lesbo sex, and we didn't want to go there.  What does that look like?  Definitely not, man.  It's like bumping cow tongues.  It's like any other...  Like any other clam.  Like any other clam, though, you don't want the old ones.  You want the newer, tighter ones.  The young, supple Lesbo scenes.  The older clams, if you find you open them up, they're a little stinky, a little gamey. 
[20:00]
 The color's a little off.  The color's a little off. Could be a little chewy.  And in the long run, it could make you sick.  Okay, terrific.  Very good.  All right, sir.  Guys, am I getting an appropriate bill?  You've got to do something.  Yeah, we're going to have some contest for those damn things today.  All right.  All right, we'll do that a little later.  All right.  All right, man. Thanks.  Peace.  Let's go to Bob.  Bob!  Bob!  What's up, Bob?  What's up? I saw Michelle Williams in an off-Broadway play down here called Killer Joe. 
[20:30]
 Yeah?  She did a totally nude scene.  Get out of town.  And you can tell that the entire audience just went there because she was doing a nude scene.  Just to see her naked.  Yeah, she's got one of those hot bodies, man.  Yeah, because when the scene came up, you could hear a pin drop and everybody leaning forward in their chairs.  You heard the whole audience like, eeeeee.  Everybody just wanted to see that. It was a bunch of lectures.  Yeah, they sat straight up to check it out. 
[21:00]
 And they had to hire a guy for the theater, too, to squeegee the floors when they were done.  Yeah, she was born to be naked, definitely.  Born to be naked.  Good line, Rick. Thank you.  Born to be naked. I like that.  We're going to use that one on the show.  We're going to ask girls if they were born to be naked.  Well.  Born to be naked.  Thank you, Bob.  Okay.  All right, peace.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, you're next on NAW.  Oh, B.  I see we've fixed the phones.  Yeah, what's up, Mike? 
[21:30]
 What's going on?  Not much.  Listen, watch at the end of that.  It's got stand-ins for those two.  It ain't her boob.  It looked like her face in that scene where she's on her back.  Yeah.  That was all Sharon Stone, though. You can tell.  No, that was. I have to say yes.  But at the end of the credits, it has something that says stand-in for those two.  Oh, really?  I don't think that was all Ellen DeGeneres. No way.  I don't think so either. 
[22:00]
 I don't think she looks that good naked.  No, dude, you're getting confused because a stand-in is someone that they have working there on the set that stands or, you know, takes the position of the actor while they get the lighting all set.  A body double is somebody who takes the place of the actor during the scene.  Yeah, but they wouldn't write body double even if it was because they wouldn't want to screw with them.  And they usually don't credit the body double.  Yeah, they want everyone to think that was Ellen's boob. That was like a stunt boob.  Stunt boob.  Stunt boob for Ellen DeGeneres, I believe. 
[22:30]
 Stunt boob played by Buddy Joe Hooker. Remember him? He was the stunt man like everything.  Like in Smokey and the Bandit.  Smokey and the Bandit. Stunt man. Buddy Joe Hooker.  All right, listen, guys. Thanks a lot. Syndication now and forever.  Thank you, Mike.  Take it easy.  All right, we've got to take a quick break, Anthony. We're just getting started here today, of course.  We've got a couple new entries for the most offensive song.  And I don't even know if we can play them on the radio. 
[23:00]
 Why? They're that bad?  There's a couple really bad ones, man.  I heard the one. I'm not even going to say the title. We don't want to ruin it.  What the hell is that doing on me again?  The studio cam. We need broads to come down to the studio cam.  Yeah, studio cams should be fun stuff.  Not us.  Just us. Who cares?  All right, well, we do have a couple more entries into the most offensive song contest, Anthony. 
[23:30]
 And they are definitely over the top. Just from the titles, I say contenders. They're very good.  Definitely contenders. We're going to play those later on in the show.  And a lot of people ask how they get their entry in for the most offensive song. Very, very easy.  Get a song in to us. Less than three minutes would be appreciated.  Make sure we can understand your lyrics. Write about whatever the hell you want. And send it in to WNEW.  We have the address here if you want to call Spaz up.  All right.  Right.  2127571027. Quick break. We'll be back. 
[24:00]
 Opie.  You scum.  And Anthony.  Your new name is Dick.  Opie and Anthony.  What changed you into such demonic little bastards?  1027.  Sickos.  WNEW.  You guys have deteriorated beyond belief right now.  Opie and Anthony Show.  There it is.  1027. WNEW.  That's my favorite sweeper by that guy.  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[24:30]
 Oh, God.  That's like a guy that's just finally given up and realized that we're here to stay.  Yeah, that's the guy that probably a year ago was hoping, you know, we'd get fired and he was all excited.  Yeah, but it didn't happen.  Now just like all the other critics out there, they're all giving up going, huh?  They are going to stick around for a while.  Yeah. Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  How did it happen? They're supposed to be fired. I understand. 
[25:00]
 All right, we're up to a year and nine months.  Remember when everyone in this damn market said Opie and Anthony will last three months?  Three months and then we're gone.  Gone. See? And then they were convinced the old N.E.W. would stay forever and that the Opie and Anthony Show was a stupid, stupid experiment.  Remember that, Ann?  Yeah.  Don't worry. Look, you'll be back to music and you two asses will be gone. 
[25:30]
 You guys are being like Tulsa.  All right. Well, we're still here.  Oops.  Oops. We pretty much outlasted everybody at this station.  Sorry.  We've been here the longest. You know that, right?  Yeah, we're the veterans.  There's only like two people on this floor that have been here longer than us.  Who?  Andrea.  Yeah.  Who does the music for the show.  And Jimmy.  Right.  Who puts together our production and does a great job at that. 
[26:00]
 They're the only two that have been here longer than us at this point.  Wow. Cleaned house.  Oh, and Earl. But Earl doesn't really work.  Earl.  We're talking about people that work.  Earl.  Yeah. So it continues. Now we have a bunch of new shows and fun stuff going on.  Yup.  And that ride out big.  That's right.  I hear Ron and Fez are talking about what we've been talking about. 
[26:30]
 Yeah. I guess they're getting a few emails about Fez and his wacky voice.  Yeah.  You know, but people are tuning in, man.  Yeah.  I was listening. They were reading some email from listeners.  I was listening.  I was listening.  I was listening.  I was listening.  I was listening.  They were reading some email from listeners.  I was dying laughing last night, man.  Like Ron is talking about some of the emails coming in about Fez's voice.  And Fez is like, every time.  What? Every Marjorie daughter, they say the same questions. 
[27:00]
 You're going to get a pump upside the head.  I don't understand it.  Then they read a letter from some guy that was calling him a fogget.  Like he couldn't spell, I guess.  Calling him a fogget.  Fogget?  What's a fogget?  I was dying though.  Really funny.  Wait, there's a chick that used to work with Earl here at NEW.  Christina.  Hi.  Is this the Christina?  Were you here when we got hired? 
[27:30]
 You might have been.  I might, yeah.  No.  We've been here a year and nine months.  Oh, no.  You used to work here at NEW.  Yeah, I worked there for about four years.  And Earl was there when I worked there.  And what do you have to say?  He didn't do anything then.  I mean, I loved him.  I loved him with all my heart.  He was a great guy.  But he was sassy.  Oh, no.  Earl does a lot for this place.  He used to walk around in all black with like pounds of stuff in his front pocket.  So they gorged out.  He still does.  And he was proud of being a virgin.  Still is.  Still is.  We're trying to get him to do it. 
[28:00]
 He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  We're trying to get a hooker to bang Earl.  Oh, it didn't work back then.  I offered back then.  Whoa.  You offered to bang Earl?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Why didn't he accept?  Because I think he was too shy.  I think Earl's gay.  No.  No.  He used to leave the kiss on the lips all the time. 
[28:30]
 Wait.  Earl's on the line.  Earl obviously taking time out of his busy work schedule to call our radio show.  Hi, Earl.  Hello, guys.  He doesn't even walk down the hall.  Wait, Earl, are you on the floor right now?  He's like, he fell like right down the hall?  He's 40 feet away.  This is how lazy the guy is.  He doesn't even walk to the studio anymore to be on our show.  He has to call it in.  Oh, Jesus.  So now this girl offered to have sex with you, Earl?  Oh, Christina?  Yeah.  She's married.  Well, I wasn't then.  She wasn't at the time, and she offered to have sex. 
[29:00]
 And what did Earl say?  He said no, no.  Why?  Why?  Because her fiance, the cop, might have had something to say about it.  I wasn't even engaged then.  She wasn't even engaged.  Yes, she was.  No, I wasn't.  Oh, my God, Earl.  Earl, what is wrong with you?  Well, you used to kiss on the lips and stuff.  What, like make-out kisses?  Oh, deep soft.  You guys used to make out?  No.  Oh, Earl.  Oh, my God.  What is going on here?  She gave great shoulder rubs.  Oh, Matt.  Matt Savoti. 
[29:30]
 I see that you're a little bit of a wimp.  Oh, Matt.  Oh, Matt.  Matt Savoti.  Hi, sweetie pie.  Hey, Christina, were you like the station horse?  Yeah.  Close to it.  Close to it.  At least you're honest.  You want your job back?  No.  I didn't pay for it.  Yeah, we'll trade Earl for you.  No way.  I wouldn't go back there if you paid me like $1,000.  No, it's a lot different than it used to be.  The place is different.  No, it's impossible.  The place is different.  No, really.  It's better.  Believe me, you're hearing it from us. 
[30:00]
 It's completely different.  You're going to echo down the hallway.  No, not anymore.  There's life.  Believe me, we would agree with you and we did for about a year and a half.  It was sad.  I know.  We walked in here like that a couple of years ago and we were ready to shoot ourselves.  It was depressing just walking the hallways, but now there's the action.  Yeah, right.  Things are happening.  I was there when the rough Jim Buff was there, Ian O'Malley was there, Jim Monahan was there,  Matt Savoti.  It was like nonstop men.  Wow, more Johnson than you can handle, I bet.  It was awesome. 
[30:30]
 It was great.  How many guys did you have sex with here?  You don't have to say who, but how many?  Sex?  Yeah.  Three.  Three?  Three of the people at NEW?  Yeah.  How many?  Well, not being one of them.  Well, not being one.  How many knobs did you hob?  Oh, geez.  Two.  Two.  Wow.  They all go back.  Oh, man.  Oh, man. 
[31:00]
 Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man. 
[31:30]
 Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Earl, how big is her ass?  Big booty?  Baby got back?  No, it wasn't that big.  Don't diss me, Earl.  It wasn't that big.  It wasn't that big.  You're being black.  Thank you.  How big? 
[32:00]
 Give me a height weight right now.  Right now?  Yeah.  Five-five, one-forty.  All right.  And back then?  Five-five, one-twenty-five.  I don't know.  I like big f-  I like big f-  So, Earl, why wouldn't you do this, Earl?  Yeah, why didn't you have sex with her?  You're kissing her and stuff.  Wow.  I wasn't engaged then, either, Earl.  Yes, you were.  Why didn't you have sex with her? 
[32:30]
 I was.  You were.  You were.  You were.  You were.  You were.  You were.  I wasn't engaged then, either, Earl.  Yes, you were.  Why did you want Earl so bad?  She was engaged, all right?  She was engaged in sex with everybody here at the station.  No, I wasn't.  Why the hell didn't you?  I was very choosy.  Oh, sure you were.  I was.  Choosy?  I was.  No, bluesy.  No, not bluesy.  Bluezy, maybe.  I don't know about choosy.  That's very choosy.  You needed a penis.  Very choosy.  I held a mirror in front of the mouth.  If it fogged, we would go into town. 
[33:00]
 I was very choosy.  You needed a penis.  Very choosy.  I held a mirror in front of the mouth.  If it fogged, we would go into town.  I was very choosy.  You guys kill me.  If you have a pulse, I'll do you.  No, that's desperate.  I don't resemble death.  What, that's her?  All right, so where the hell did this come from?  What is that?  Where did this come from?  It's a chick that just gave a hummer, and she's like, oh, I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to kill you.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  It's a chick that just gave a hummer, and she's got that glazed donut look on her face. 
[33:30]
 Oh, no, no, no, no.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Be nice.  It was taken right after the money shot.  Yeah.  Exactly.  All right.  It looks like she has a runny nose.  Yeah, she needs a night quell.  So when did you leave this fine establishment?  I guess it was like 93 or 94.  Yeah.  Now, why did you want Earl?  We're shocked that anyone wants Earl. 
[34:00]
 He wanted to cure his virginity.  Kind of.  That's what I'm guessing, right?  Probably.  Did you want that Louisiana black snake?  No, we could never tell what he had.  His pockets were always so full of garbage, you could never tell.  That wasn't garbage, baby.  Yeah.  That was junk.  What, you checked out every guy's package here at NEW?  Well, yeah.  I mean, most of them wore really tight jeans.  You know, Mally wore tight jeans.  Saba Leo wore tight jeans.  All right.  Are these the guys she's had sex with?  No, no, no, no.  Are they?  No, no, no, no.  Okay. 
[34:30]
 They just were all, you know.  You want to fess up?  Were they on air, any of the guys you had sex with?  No.  No?  All behind the scenes.  Yeah.  Oh, interesting.  And Earl, why wouldn't you go for the banging?  I just didn't.  Oh, stop it.  Oh, my.  Why?  Why not, Earl?  Banging!  She sounds like somebody who was, you know, wasn't just a quick pick up off the street  where you didn't know what you were getting.  No, I didn't know what I was getting.  The working relationship and she was offering.  Hey, Earl, do you like man-ass?  Yeah, Earl, you've got to be honest.  Do you like cranky man-ass?  Earl likes cranky ass after someone pops a nugget. 
[35:00]
 This girl sounds like she'd be a lot of fun to bang.  She had everything Earl wants except a penis.  Did you just have sex, like, on the job and stuff, Christina?  No, no, not on the job, but on the job.  Where did you have sex?  On the job.  On the job.  On the job.  On the job.  On the job.  On the job.  On the job.  On the job.  On the job.  On the job.

[40:00]
 i'mgg  let's see  but  and  ik  herbal questions you want me to read  and  Moones really  the  I swear to God, I'm going to hit somebody. 
[40:30]
 I do Psycho Mark with right out of the studio.  That's a good one. That's pretty funny.  Are there any others worth reading here?  Number which one?  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  Alright. This one's good?  Wow, yeah.  Which will go down in your memories as a Fonda radio experience?  Working with Opie and Anthony or with Scott Muni?  Because Errol did work for Scott Muni for many years.  I would say it's got to be Scott. 
[41:00]
 And before I read this answer, I have no clue what it's going to say.  I do have to say we really like Scott.  Tough question, Errol writes.  It's really hard to compare the two shows.  Working for Scott was a blast.  He taught me a lot, not only about radio, but about life.  Opie and Anthony really taught me how to lighten up.  And that radio should be fun.  How many people can say that they've worked with Scott Muni and Opie and Anthony?  I'm a very lucky guy.  Did you write that one, Errol?  Yes, I did.  If you wrote that one, you must have wrote the other one. 
[41:30]
 No, I didn't.  Oh, man.  I swear to God, I didn't write the other one.  Alright. Well, very good.  If you want to read the rest of the questions from the Black Earl interview,  it's on the FoundryMusic.com website.  I guess it's my time to share.  Insightful, concise interviews.  And, Errol, I appreciate you walking down the hall.  That was very nice. Thank you.  Instead of calling us on the phone.  It's my turn to barrel.  I love this phoning in his moment. 
[42:00]
 Phoning in my stuff.  Hey, Kevin, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, Opie and Anthony?  Talking to Errol. What's up with you?  Oh, Errol is totally gay, man.  Yeah? Why?  Totally.  Because why wouldn't you bang her?  Yeah, why wouldn't you?  Because she's a virgin.  Why wouldn't you bang her?  Because she really likes to give, you know, the oral and stuff,  and she did everyone else.  Why not you, Errol?  You don't have a commitment, nothing.  Why didn't you bang her?  I guess, I mean, she was... 
[42:30]
 She was...  She was gay.  You said she was...  She was engaged at the time.  She was...  She was engaged.  No, I said she was engaged at the time.  Was she attractive?  Very attractive.  Damn, you got to go there, man.  I was good friends with her, I believe, her still husband.  Oh, is she the girl that came by, like, recently that you introduced me to?  No.  It's not the same one?  No.  Not the same Christine?  Errol has a lot of girls that hang around him, but none of them bang him.  Could we get you a banging, Errol?  Yeah, we could.  Could we get you a girl to hob your knob? 
[43:00]
 Yes or no?  Scott's up.  Yeah?  Yeah, what's up?  I just wanted to say that I don't believe that Errol is gay.  One day, Errol and I were sniffing the seat that John Lennon sat in, and I attempted to  reach around and give him a dirty stint.  He wouldn't allow me to do so. 
[43:30]
 Oh, cut it out.  But...  Errol, did you bang Scott so?  No, I didn't.  No, no, no.  And I have a message from a friend of yours, Ope.  Yeah?  He says to say to you, hiya, dopey.  What?  It's the hiya, dopey guy.  Oh, all right.  All right, Errol.  He actually loves the show.  Oh my God.  This is a nighttime of a gun, I guess.  Doug on line eight has something to say to you.  Doug, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  How are you? 
[44:00]
 What's going on with this guy?  He's a fruit puppet.  A fruit puppet?  He could get laid in a woman's prison with a handful of pardons.  What's the matter with you?  You had a girl coming on to you, and you don't want to give them that Louisiana black snake.  Yeah, it sounds like the girl was wild, too, Errol.  I think you have to go for that one.  Yeah.  What's the matter with you with that Louisiana black snake?  Hey, I got a good idea.  I heard you don't know how to hang pictures.  You know where you can learn how to hang pictures?  Wattons have a good place for you to go hang things.  They have a Ku Klux Klan.  They'll teach you how to hang things.  Oh, come on. 
[44:30]
 That old gag.  John, what's going on?  Nothing much.  Hey.  I think I know why Errol did the playboy.  Why?  Well, he's saying her boyfriend was going to get pissed.  Right.  I think his boyfriend was going to be more upset.  Pretty good.  Very good, John.  Thanks.  You guys go.  All right, man.  Out.  All right.  Errol, you're getting a bad rap here, man.  Well, Errol, I'm sure you have a...  My time in the gun.  I'm sure you have a very busy day planned.  Probably have a lot of things to do before 5 o'clock.  What are you going to do now?  Going down the hall, what can we expect? 
[45:00]
 What can we expect from Errol today?  I'm going to write the public file.  Okay, very good.  Write like W-R-I-T-E or write it R-I-G-H-T.  Which thing?  I'm going to write it.  Write the public file.  Okay, write it.  All right.  The public file.  What's that?  I don't know.  Every station is required to have a public file.  Right.  I'm ready.  Oh, writing.  All right, Errol.  Thank you.  Punching up any porn on the computers or anything? 
[45:30]
 No?  No?  Is that true that that happened?  I heard some stories.  Mark Bookmark, the freaking gay porno side of it.  Errol, I wasn't even going to say that.  I know, boy.  One time I came...  I'm walking to work.  I found one of my computers.  There's a gay porn side on my computer.  Oh, what a coincidence.  It was already on there.  What are you talking about?  I just happened to be flipping through it.  It was just there.  Did you get in trouble once, Errol, for having a porno on your computer? 
[46:00]
 They asked me about it and I said, I had no idea.  I swear to God.  I heard this story that like...  I'm like, I had porn.  I'm like, what's the story?  I'm used to it.  That like his computer was loaded up with porno.  First thing in the porno.  And your ass, what happened?  And who does the computer?  Ria.  Tells us nothing.  I'm like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.  And your ass, what happened?  And who does the computer?  Ria.  Tells us not to shut off the computers.  I left mine on.  I come in the next morning and I think it was Matt. 
[46:30]
 He's like, are you leaving porn on the computer?  I'm like, no.  He goes, well, we came in and there's a whole thing on the screen.  You know, like news to me.  I heard like the hard drive was tagged with like porno.  Oh my God, you got to delete those files, people.  That's classic.  And then they gave you like some type of warning or something?  I said, I told the truth.  I went, I know nothing about it. 
[47:00]
 And they just said, keep the porno off the company computers.  It's just like, I'm not, I said, I'll keep it on because I don't put it on.  Oh, sure.  Okay.  We believe you, all right?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, we got to take a break, Anthony.  Okay.  We're all going to go back and look at Earl's computer for some porno.  Cool.  I heard there's some kiddie porn on there too.  Oh my God.  We should get a list of all the websites that Earl's been to lately.  That could be pretty fun. 
[47:30]
 Hey.  Gary Pooter in the studio.  All right.  Let's take a break, Anthony.  And we'll be back.  Stay there.  Opie.  Keep your hands away from your pants.  Oh, too late.  And Anthony.

 Send a Bear Gram gift for St. Patrick's Day or any occasion.  The creative alternative to sending flowers.  That's 1-800-829-BEAR.  And Telemope and Anthony from N.E.W. sent you.  Anthony, lots of instant feedback coming in about our buddy, our pal, Black Earl.  Yeah, Richie from Westchester.  The reason Earl wears black all the time is because he is in constant mourning of his dead penis.  Oh, that's pretty funny.  Frank from Manhattan writes,  because we were talking to that girl that wanted to bang Earl when she used to work here, and Earl liked to knight her. 
[50:00]
 Yeah.  Frank writes from Manhattan, if she wears a strap on, would Earl bang her?  And Rob from Jersey, okay guys, get off Earl. Scott Muney just did.  Oh!  That's very funny.  Couple more coming in here.  Yeah.  Michelle writes, why is Earl still a virgin? I looked him up on the studio cam and he's not that bad.  He has to be gay. 
[50:30]
 Wow, look at that.  Rich from Jersey, is there any truth to the rumor that Earl and Spaz are doing a man-man porno called Bungle Fever?  Bungle Fever.  Ouch, babe.  Speaking of Bungle Fever, Anthony.  Yeah.  I don't know. What do you want to do? We have a bunch of people sending in songs for the most offensive song ever.  Yes.  We are looking for the most offensive song ever written.  And the entries are really getting out there. 
[51:00]
 Really bad.  There's one we're going to play later that's going to outrage a ton of people, I believe.  I think both of them that came in that we're probably going to play today.  We're going to play two today.  They're very offensive.  I don't know.  And will upset a lot of people.  This next song will upset a lot of people, but we are trying to find the most offensive song.  So how do we handle this, Anthony? How do we handle it?  I think that's how we handle it.  The topic is write the most offensive song and send it into the show. We'll play it.  We say beforehand the views expressed in these songs are not necessarily those of Opie and Anthony's show or WNEW Radio. 
[51:30]
 That's the first time we ever said that. That's how bad these songs are, though.  But, God damn, they're funny.  That's the whole goal of this thing.  Is send in the most offensive song.  So obviously you have to top the last one.  Wait a minute. I'm trying to listen to you, but through the reflection behind you, I can see the picture is up on your board there of the girl that just got the facial. 
[52:00]
 I put her up on my board here with all the show ideas and whatnot that we have to do today.  You're getting inspiration or something over there?  There's a picture of a girl that looks like she has a really bad runny nose.  But it's a picture taken right after the money shot.  It kind of looks like she got too close to the hose when someone turned it on.  It looks like somebody... you know what it looks like?  It looks like she was dipping into the strutalizing before it got put on the cake. 
[52:30]
 Yeah, it sure does, man. Anyway.  Oh my God.  Horrible explosion at the Elmer's Glue Factory.  Leaves one injured.  That's a great shot.  We should put that picture up on the unofficial website.  Have people just make captions.  The eye-half shot on the one side is great, too.  God, I love it. 
[53:00]
 Hold it in front of the instant feedback.  In front of the camera, studio cam.  Is the studio cam even working today?  I heard it was.  All right, hold on. We'll try to put the picture up on the studio cam.  Yeah, let me get...  And then you guys could like... yeah.  Yeah, take a look at it.  Wait, you've got to go back further, Rick.  Then you won't be able to see the splooges, though.  You can't say that word. I think people know what we're talking... 
[53:30]
 You can't really see it.  No, I don't think so.  It's somewhere, so it's just there on camera.  All right, don't move. Let's see that.  That might work. Don't move.  See, you're in...  It's a contrast problem.  Yeah, it's not going to happen, but you guys get the idea.  Try that.  Studio cam, you could go to www.com.  We're really not doing much with it yet,  but eventually it'll be a very important part of our radio show.  You can't really see... you could almost see a little on her cheek. 
[54:00]
 You can't get the full impact of how much...  Here we go.  How much friggin'...  All right, try that. That might work right there.  All right.  Just imagine what's all over...  Okay. All right, let's see if that works.  Yeah, a little on the lip.  Let's see if anyone is commenting about that.  No, no, no, no, no.  Okay, I'm trying to see. It's a little out of focus, too, but...  That's the problem now. It's just not focused. 
[54:30]
 That's what it is.  There's a bunch of people saying they can't see it.  All right.  We tried.  Well, maybe we'll put it on the website with that little black bar over the eyes.  Right.  That tells... whenever I see that, I know I'm looking at some real good porno.  When they have to blank the eyes out with that black bar.  All right, Ant, do you want to play one of the entries to the most offensive song contest?  Well, what are we going to do?  We announce a little contest, and what, we're not going to do it? 
[55:00]
 No, we can't be pussies.  We've got to play all the entries that we think are interesting.  Like I said before, that's the object of this contest, the most offensive song.  We're not playing it, saying that it's a great tune.  Let's play this and have fun with it.  Well, no, we are.  And who sent this one in, Rick?  He goes by the name Fuel.  Fuel.  Fuel sent it in.  Fuel sent it in.  All right, this is Fuel's entry into the Open Anthony most offensive song contest, Anthony. 
[55:30]
 All right, hold on to your hats.  One, two, three, four.  How much is that dark in the window?  Please say that dark is for sale.  How much is that dark in the window?  Don't make me pay extra for the mail.  I must take a trip to California. 
[56:00]
 I need someone to home along.  If I die that dark in a long dream,  He can get the job done while I'm gone.  How much is that dark in the window? 
[56:30]
 For the one with the long dangly arms.  How much is that dark in the window?  I've got things neat pickin' on my farm.  I have a wife who needs a meetin'.  But I can't afford to go to jail. 
[57:00]

[59:30]
 Yo, O&A.  Dude, I'm driving through Newark and Maplewood right now,  with the windows down and that song playing.  You gotta see the looks I'm gettin'.  I forgot it was one of those days where you do want your windows down,  the top down, your crank in the stereo, and that's coming out of your speakers.  That can't be a good thing.  Jesus Christ, I gotta get outta here.  Alright Conrad, thank you. 
[60:00]
 Alright, Nick, what's going on?  What's up guys?  How are you Nick?  You should have had the inappropriate bell on cruise control for that one.  We warned you, I didn't really want to play that song,  but I don't know what else to do if we're gonna have a most offensive song contest.  Yeah, we gotta play them.  We gotta play all the entries.  That's why I love you guys.  Alright, thanks Nick.  Later.  Bye.  Let's go to Scott.  Scott, what's going on?  Oh, we lost Scott.  He was scared actually.  He goes, I am scared that I just listened to that song.  Tim, what's up?  You're next on NAW. 
[60:30]
 Hey guys, what's up?  Hey.  That one sucked compared to the Barry Manilow version.  Yeah, it seems like the Barry Manilow song is still in the lead  as we try to find the most offensive song ever.  This one was like two repetitions over and over.  Yeah, yeah.  The darkie, the window, that kinda sucked.  Yeah, you've got a point.  I agree with him.  Alright.  After the third chorus of that you hear, you're a little tired of it.  Yeah, kinda.  Shock values.  On and on and on.  Alright, thank you.  One more thing.  You teach me how to make banana bread.  You home-ex-baggot.  Over and out.  Get out of here. 
[61:00]
 Instant feedback coming in about the song, Anthony.  Bill from the City, I bet that tune would make the top ten list in Memphis.  Oh, probably would.  Shoney from New York.  I just broke my inappropriate bell.  John from the Island, that belongs on MTV's TRL.  It was a hit.  Oh, Jesus.  The end AAACP, checking in from Jersey.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  Okay, terrific.  Very inappropriate.  Let's go to Matt.  Matt, you're next on NAW. 
[61:30]
 Okay, terrific.  That was one of the best things you guys have ever played.  I think the first one was better though, but that was definitely a good, catchy tune.  Alright, yeah, we have to decide which one's in the lead.  You're thinking the Barry Manilow song?  Yeah, I'd say Barry Manilow was better, but this one had a better guitar going.  Alright.  I know a little.  Yeah, we want you guys to pay attention to all the songs we play.  We do have another entry later on today.  Oh, great.  Alright.  What time?  Alright, I don't know.  Alright, cool.  I'll be listening all day anyway.  Alright, cool.  Alright, take it easy guys.  Bye. 
[62:00]
 Later.  Awful.  Horrendously awful.  Well, that's the object of the contest.  I mean, what are we going to say, right?  Right.  Right.  Seth, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  Ah, this is what happened.  I was listening to the song.  Yeah.  And I got to a gas station to grab a pack of cigarettes.  Yeah.  And I left my windows open and I had the thing blasted.  And there was a black lady right next to me in a car with her kids.  And she was getting her kid out of the car to get something in the store and she started  flipping out on me.  How can I listen to that kind of stuff?  What's wrong with me?  Going nuts.  Wow.  Crazy stuff.  Crazy stuff. 
[62:30]
 Is it as good as the first song?  I think it's better.  Alright.  I think it's much better.  Thank you, bro.  Alright, we got the guy that wrote the song on line four here.  Jeff, what's up?  How are you doing?  Good.  Hello.  Hey.  What's up, Jeff?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, Jeff?  Nothing. 
[63:00]
 You were the guy that wrote that song, huh?  Yeah.  We wrote it yesterday.  Well, you're getting mixed reviews on your song.  Yeah.  You know, I know it drones a little bit.  What are you going to do?  It was just at two minutes.  I was like, it's done, but whatever.  Yeah.  Put it in.  Alright.  We're going to play your other entry a little later on in the show.  I think that one's worse.  What?  The one we just played?  No, I think the second one's worse.  Yeah, I believe so.  I think that one's more offensive.  Alright, man.  Alright.  Thank you.  Well, Ant, there you have it.  The latest entry in the worst song ever written. 
[63:30]
 Not bad.  By Fuel.  It's a contender, but I don't know if it'll hold up.  Jeff, AKA Fuel.  Very good.  Alright, man.  We've got to take a break.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Fun, ladies and gentlemen.  You guys are really funny and stuff, but you guys take it too far to the point where I  literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show.  Go take a mitle.  Diarrhea, wave, hit prisons, supper blade. 
[64:00]
 In Kingston, Jamaica.  Jamaican prison.  Jamaican prison.  That's got to be some great accommodations they got there in a Jamaican prison, huh?  And all the inmates getting diarrhea because of bad supper.  A mass outbreak of diarrhea has hit two Jamaican prisons with more than a thousand convicts  suffering.  Doctors are struggling frantically to contain the outbreak which inmates have blamed on 
[64:30]
 their Sunday supper.  The Sunday supper, just in case you're wondering.  Spicy crab soup.  Chinese cabbage.  Rice peas and chicken.  No, no, they didn't have the rice peas and chicken.  Sunday meal of rice peas and chicken.  Opie, you're getting the story wrong.  I preach a cut.  Oh, they should have got the rice peas and chicken, but instead they got the spicy crab 
[65:00]
 soup and the Chinese cabbage.  And some kind of vegetable taro.  Whatever that is.  And uh, oh no.  Diarrhea cha cha cha.  Angry prisoners on Monday dump scores of paper bags loaded with feces in passageways to the  cell blocks in protest.  That's great.  So they have the bad supper.  Everyone has diarrhea.  Now they're putting the diarrhea in paper bags. 
[65:30]
 You know what's great?  You go to a zoo and look at the monkeys.  What do they do?  They crap in their hand and throw it at the people that are standing outside the cages.  Correct.  Doesn't sound like much different is happening in these Jamaican prisons.  No.  Oh my God.  Throwing their feces at people because they get diarrhea.  That's great.  Now the treatment was hampered because some prisoners refused to come out of their cells  for medication, fearing attacks from other inmates.  A special security team was going to cells to give inmates on the spot treatment if needed. 
[66:00]
 This medical team had to go from cell to cell to give them treatment as there's diarrhea  all over their cells.  I heard one clever inmate lit the bag on fire in front of the warden's door, knocked and  ran away.  That old gag.  All right.  So they're working overtime to pinpoint the source of the episode.  But there you have it.  A thousand convicts in Kingston, Jamaica, suffering from diarrhea, Anthony. 
[66:30]
 Diarrhea.  After a bad Sunday supper.  All right.  We're clapping.  Clapping all over you.  Hey.  We're clapping.  My pants are all full of goo.  Hey.  We're clapping.  Hey. 
[67:00]
 We're clapping.  Hey.  We're clapping.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  We're clapping.  Hey.  Hey. 
[67:30]

[68:00]
 I hope this time is gonna last  Right now, we're just a few nights  Life is quite much harder than gold  Either can be fun or so  Life is quite much harder than gold  Either can be fun or so  Life is quite much harder than gold  I don't just see the diarrhea 
[68:30]
 Praying mud in Jamaica  I 
[69:00]
 Like the new  Well an outbreak of diarrhea  Oh 
[69:30]
 Must not be very you know how it sucks and you have diarrhea anyway, and you're in the best of conditions  imagine that a Jamaican prison 
[70:00]
 What's up David yeah, I gotta figure it out. I know what happened in Jamaica the warden was at the bottom of it  He wanted to put an end to all of the gay sex going on there. Hey, that would definitely put a damper on it. Hey  What that would wreck the party wouldn't absolutely you  Look like the mud people from Woodstock

Give us a call if if you want in on the show today  Coming up at 430 Louis black  Yeah, always a pleasure to have him in the studio we love when Louis black stops by the studio 
[73:30]
 He loves talking about current events and things like that things going on stuff that he finds funny in the news Anthony  Yes, you know, he's probably got a lot of talk about what's happening in politics. I guess McCain bowed out today  Yeah, that's it Bradley bowed out. We kind of knew a while ago that it was gonna be Bush and Gore  Yeah, going for all the marbles and I just have a feeling  George W Bush it's gonna be our next president. You really think George W just like daddy get in there 
[74:00]
 President I think so. I don't know Gore's gonna have to first of all  He's got that whole image problem of being a stick figure and then he's got the Clinton thing  Yeah, you know, he was vice president of a president that was in there for two terms  I don't think I ever saw him in the same room together tell you the truth and he had no clue what was going on  You know, he didn't know what his president was doing. He knew exactly what was going on and I think I just think that sucks 
[74:30]
 I mean, you know, he was going for the you know, the the primary and stuff you would think Clinton would help him out  But how many times have you seen Clinton on the tube?  Endorsing gore yeah for the nomination  The answer would be zero none you don't say they're keeping them apart  And if I was Gore, I'd be so pissed at Clinton like hey, you got eight years as president  I hope you're happy because you really screwed my chances. Yeah, Jack ass. Yeah, not that Gore has much of a chance  I don't know because people that voted on party lines will get all those votes because he's Democrat 
[75:00]
 But uh, I don't know. He doesn't have any charisma. He doesn't have nothing Bush does but well, he's got to shake the image of being  Nothing he's a wood the one thing you got to worry about that Anthony McCain  If he if he runs as an independent, it's gonna screw up the whole election, right?  The parole factor and I think McCain is so pissed off at the tactics that Bush used with the market of campaigning and stuff  He might want to just shove it up his you know, what? 
[75:30]
 I don't know cuz that always wrecks the voting. Yeah. Yeah when you have kind of  Technically two Republicans on the ticket splits it up splits it up bad  What happened Perot took a lot of votes away from Bush and Clinton won, huh? I don't see what happens. All right  There's your political break. There you go political commentary from Opie and Anthony. I personally don't even care who our next president is  Yeah, there's nothing really changes for me  Well, they all have great big ideas Anthony. They all want to you know as they campaign they tell you everything they're gonna change 
[76:00]
 They want a red or it's gonna be they all want to reduce taxes. They all want you know  Um health insurance for everybody right nothing changes. No, we just chug along just chug along  The economy goes up it goes down things happen. It's on autopilot  Speaking of up a down making a great recovery today  154 really closed Nasdaq huge with 150 points on the upside. Very nice. Very good Travis 
[76:30]
 Yeah, what's up Travis? Yeah, I swear to God I was on the bus yesterday  This is a really scary thing is black girls talking about the election  Right, uh-huh, and they believe that George Bush seniors running they're like, oh he running again  Scary thought no he running. No, it's true. That's not a joke  They did a poll and up until two weeks ago  Everyone thought it was his father running for president again 
[77:00]
 A lot of people still think it's George Bush running again. It's friggin scary  In fact that and these people gonna decide, you know who our next president's gonna be I don't know  I think no, I don't know George. George W should be running for president of Quick Records  All right, Travis, thank you. All right. Bye. Let's go to Rocko Rocko. You're next at any w  Yeah, we're talking about how many times Bill Clinton is actually went stumped for Al Gore. Yes, you think it carries any weight?  I think that was that was part of the strategy was to keep Bill Clinton and Al Gore separate. Do we have a fighting chain? 
[77:30]
 Oh, yeah, that's what we understand all that  But I mean, you know if it's out more, you know sat around and knew exactly what Clint was up to and didn't speak  You know, I don't want that guy's my next president  But then you got to think of the flip side of that if it comes out and says, you know  Bill Clinton's out banging everything that moves you think the Democrats gonna look to him to carry the party in 2000  It just shows you what?  Lunatic Clinton is and what everybody thinks of him because if you have a two-term president and an incumbent vice president running for the presidency 
[78:00]
 You have the two-term president just pushing this guy every second  Yeah under normal circumstances  You know, you're dealing with some hillbilly guy from Arkansas. That's probably  I'd have a lot more respect for Al Gore if you open his big, you know trap when the whole Clinton thing was going down  Al Gore was in Hawaii they got him on the exact opposite part of the globe  Well, what's what's what's a place to be and I don't think to this day  He's a well, yeah, he started like talking bad about the president and his actions finally 
[78:30]
 Yeah long after it meant anything, you know, I just would have a lot more respect for the guy if he spoke up  You know, it's party suicide. There you go  The politics are so who you're voting for  Nobody yeah, I mean I'll do George W. I voted for his father. I usually you know, I'm not I don't vote strictly party line  George W in this case. He happens to be the better of the two W 
[79:00]
 George W got it. It says who are the hot chicks standing behind George W. That's his daughters, right?  Is it someone's daughter? That's what we need more hotties in the White House, man. Come on. Bring them on screw this Chelsea  Chelsea out of there finished and took eight years and she still you know doesn't look that great  Chelsea's now she knows something let me tell you she's turned around I understand. No, no now she's turning again though  Oh, really? She went through that phase where she looked like a chicken 
[79:30]
 Chicken with a fright wig on you know, what then she went that hair though. Yeah. Well, then she went through a phase where she  Started in college and it was almost acceptable like you're looking and going all right, you know, there's something going on there now  It's her mother with our fingers stuck in a light socket  That's what she looks like now. She's starting to really look like Hillary  I saw a picture in the paper of her and I thought it was Hillary for a second  Yeah, get a penis and blanket now. Yeah, I rock oh, but a couple of hotsters in the White House like that  It's gonna be Bush. It doesn't matter. Yep 
[80:00]
 Real Bush instead of that Barbara Bush God bless America. All right. Thank you guys. That's what we need  It's gonna be a boring four years of whoever gets in like you said, yeah, you're right now that you know  Clinton's term is coming to an end. I'm kind of gonna miss the guy  How are you gonna compete with a president who is getting his thingy done in the Oval Office?  There's no nothing you could do  Yeah, unless he comes to a press conference with a vibrating butt plug in place in his pants down. How you doing? 
[80:30]
 Yes, not I got a little vibrating butt plot. Mm-hmm  Yeah, Brian alive for it wants to say well Bush is killing people in Texas well, we know that I was getting hummers amazing  We learned yesterday that Bush that Clinton was amazed by a screen saver  Technology of the 21st century out there. He's amazed by a screen saver. Uh, Brian. Hey, what's going on?  Oh, and I what's up big fan man? Listen, you know, you guys know we've got the I'm listening 
[81:00]
 I'm for capital punishment. Yeah, and he's he's frying him like crazy down there in Texas  Yeah, and I know even though they took that form of the death penalty away from us, unfortunately  Women children listen, I'm a full supporter of that  However, and we all know Clintons an idiot and we all know why Clinton and Gore have been separated  You know with Gore running here  But the fact is if you look at brush the guy's out of his mind, you know  It's everything you don't know about Bush and that's not talked about that. I quite it makes me nervous 
[81:30]
 Like what listen I know you're calling in and I know supporters of your show these these these guys out there  We have support your show their pro-choice Bush is in pro-choice  Who can do you let me ask you something? Wait a minute. Wait, I hate when they use as an issue pro-choice  If you listen to me on the pro-choice issue, how many Republicans have been in office since Roe versus Wade? I  Have no hell of a lot and you know what the women's right to have an abortion has not been taken away 
[82:00]
 It is not an issue. It isn't it? No, it isn't  Holy mother of pearl so you're gonna sacrifice everything that is an issue in a presidential race  Just because a guy is is against a woman's right to have a boy man Bush you want to vote for Bush?  The guy no, I don't want to vote. I don't know about Bush. It makes everyone nervous  All I'm saying is they're not gonna overturn Roe versus Wade  Yeah, the Republican is in office who's willing to take that risk Reagan was in there eight years 
[82:30]
 Four years  Listen to me that's 12 years of a Republican in a row in there and they didn't take it away  ten years of really right  Republican, you know what's got to be done here is  Radley needs to run as an independent and we need to vote for what cares how this guy dresses hug a tree  Tree my friend go get on one of those zodiac boats with Greenpeace save a whale  It doesn't matter. Believe me. I am the most pro-choice person on the face of the earth 
[83:00]
 I think women should be able to walk down the street and pull their goddamn uterus out on Broadway  I don't care believe me, but a Republican president has nothing to do nothing to do  with  Pro-choice don't worry about it. There's other issues. All right. I don't agree but hey  What are you gonna do with the big fan guys? Thank you  That's people trying to scare you into voting one way or the other 
[83:30]
 Are you really all side? Are you really into the Bush thing or what? No, I'm really not into the Bush thing  I just I'm not into you the guy. I'm just I don't think the gore thing is is uh, I  Don't see that happening. You know, I think Bush will get in there  That's it. It'll be business as you business as usual  Doesn't matter. He's gonna settle change gonna say he's gonna try to reduce taxes. Oh, yes  Yeah, that's all it doesn't matter hotties in the White House. That's all I care. Just keep the economy strong 
[84:00]
 That's all we care about webcam in the kids room  Well, I don't know I mean this the whole political discussion and gets boring fast, right?  Well, it all depends on the spin you put on it and we do have Lewis Black coming in soon  Yeah, he'll give a bill hit on so they'll give a great spin on that in about 15 minutes  I'll be here Lewis Black from Comedy Central on the line smelly Karen  Well, that's the only way to just you know  Describe you Karen 
[84:30]
 We're not gonna abuse you, you know  I'm getting pounded by the  Descriptions of the show I even I hold on hold on we'll get to you in a sec  Scott says we don't know anything about politics Scott. It's very true. Hey doing guys. All right now explain your side  And then we will counter. Okay. Well, first of all  Hold on. All right. Hold on. Let's do it now without cursing. Okay, he's given an S about abortion 
[85:00]
 Okay, Bush tried to have it overturned  and many Republicans in states are  Trying to have it overturned and have been for quite a few years and in many states not this one have been very successful  That's what you fail to say. Oh, please that is not that isn't true. It's very true. You know that  right-wing  Campaign has been on for at least ten years  Forcing the medical schools to stop teaching how to do a lot 
[85:30]
 You know something it's this propaganda on both sides  Yeah, yeah, I know I agree with you and the fact of the matter is it is a law that has been passed and  That's it. Don't push being in there or Gore being in there isn't going to do anything one way or the other  Okay, well, what about Supreme Court justices?  Appointing them. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know that gets the point at least three if not four and that's enough to overturn Roe v 
[86:00]
 Wade  Yeah, well, we'll see we'll see if that happens I severely doubt it I  severely doubted it would be there'd be an enormous civil war I think hinging your choice on on pro or a choice or  Pro-life as far as voting for president goes is really silly  Well, that's like a  Being that you're a guy that's like to know a woman. No, I'm saying it's a little bit of a different story 
[86:30]
 No, it's like it's like deciding what restaurant you're gonna eat at based on what color the napkins are on the table  That's what I'm talking about. It is you think that's how important abortion is for a woman. No, I'm saying it's a very important woman  It's not an issue. It won't matter one way or the other  It hasn't for years. That's what I'm saying. Yes. It is an important issue  Is it an important issue in a presidential election? It shouldn't be it doesn't matter  I agree with you that it shouldn't be in an ideal world, but it is I mean you guys are here 
[87:00]
 You were in Boston before that, you know, you got to go out to some of the rural areas  It's a it's a much different story. Every church you pass has of enormous fields of crosses for the unborn  I know it's been happening for years. Don't you hear what I'm saying? It doesn't matter who's in office  It there's been years of Republicans in office. It doesn't matter  Don't you think that every single appointee that Reagan and Bush made to the Supreme Court was  scrutinized over this question  Yeah, and why would they pick they were picked because they were pro-life. Oh 
[87:30]
 Not necessarily and that's why so many especially under Bush didn't get in  Yes, see it's not like they all of a sudden decide who's gonna get in and they get in Supreme Court  Justices well, they have to run through the gauntlet on both sides if someone is totally  Pro-life they're not gonna have an easy time to get in just because George W. Bush is president what depends who controls Congress  If you ever poke in Congress and you ever a publican president, so I play ping-pong, please 
[88:00]
 We're having a debate  I feel like I'm in French history class. All I'm saying is after years of Republicans being in office through the 70s  It's not an issue. Okay. All right. Well besides which Bush is a moron  I think they're all morons. Thank you Scott. All right, bye guys  Come on, they're all morons. You guys really want us to play this song people gonna freakin lose their minds. Which one's this?

 I think Billy got the idea for that song during his colonoscopy  Hi, I like to forget the inappropriate bill you need the Liberty Bell those liberty down on that song  All right. Well, let's go the phones here. Keith. What's going on?  Yeah, that song was great, man. I don't know if it was great  I was laughing so hard. I turned my computer off by accident  I mean if we're looking for the most offensive song  I do believe we have a leader in the in the contest 
[94:30]
 Oh, definitely better than the first when you played today  Well, well, we have another one to play and I don't think it's gonna come close to what we just heard  I can I you know, you got it. You got a plan  It was great because honestly that that songs been on our desk for the last couple of days  And I was like, I don't even know if we can freakin play this damn thing  Yeah, a couple bleeps out a couple bleeps. You guys only heard half the song. They were dumping out of it like crazy  I can hear the dumps on the air. Yeah, we had to put another bleep in  We got to play it in its entirety 
[95:00]
 Yeah, but somebody here Chris on instant saying guys the air six song was more offensive  But the Barry Manilow parody was to me funnier now, let me let me tell you it doesn't matter  We are looking for offensive the most offensive song now. It was not funny. Well, it's up to you guys to decide  I mean is the the one from air sick in the lead as far as most offensive goes Anthony on  Justin feedback just saying holy ass winner  Well  We'll see it just puts the bar up that much higher. I I don't know if I could be part of this contest anymore 
[95:30]
 What did you grow a vagina dude?  Did you hear the lyrics of that song? Yeah  I am putting it in the context of what it is the most offensive song  We I think they did a fine job at writing a very offensive tune  We had that on our desk for a while and we weren't really sure what to do with it  Then the whole abortion issue came up and then Rick runs it in here. Well, the pliers thing was pretty much 
[96:00]
 Thank you, let's go to Eric Eric you're next on W any W  Hey what you have a  Thing was I was hard. That was wrong. That's it. I was absolutely wrong  And I gotta tell you if you got anything in the coffins back there that's worse than that  I don't know if I can handle it that I get into an accident now every five minutes 
[96:30]
 the scary part about this contest is  Now now we raise the bar I could  It's gonna come in next, you know people are gonna go out of their minds trying to do worse than that now  Yeah  Anything else anything else is gonna sound tame at this point. Yeah. Oh my goodness. Oh, by the way Anthony  Yes, President Clinton is amazed at a screensaver yesterday. He just found out Air Force one is not a choo-choo train 
[97:00]
 Yeah, we do have one more song to play one more entry into the contest we're not gonna I'm not gonna give the title out yet  We have a lady on line I was waiting for this Jeannie  Hi, it's Jeannie Jeannie. I'm sorry. Hello. How are you five months? You're five months pregnant, huh? Yes, I am and  That song made me absolutely sick to my stomach. Yeah  Oh, you should have went with your instincts and not played it. Well, it's the most offensive song contest  What is it supposed to do? It's too offensive it for the most offensive contest 
[97:30]
 Yeah, actually, I think that kind of crossed the line  No, but that's just it and it's not it's not the opi show  You know what I'm saying? We all have a vote in this and I'll tell you  I was definitely on the fence with that song. I can't lie. I can't lie  And I'm the one that usually says the sickest crap for this radio  I know I'm very surprised at you Anthony very surprised. What do you think? I'm agreeing with the song. Is that it?  Like you think I'm condoning what the song says? 
[98:00]
 Well, I think we all agreed that we wanted to have this contest after the full-blown eight song that Jay Moore and  And his buddy Mike Deena Kola wrote and I just didn't expect it to get to this  That's all I'm trying to say if you think about it really gotta be offensive, you know  And you guys agreed you said let's go for the contest. I remember we were asking the audience  We said it would get brutal. We said it would get way out there  Yeah, you want to come out where we screen it and oh, it's too offensive for the most offensive song contest 
[98:30]
 No, I can't imagine what was dumped out  Yes  Can't imagine. Yeah. All right. All righty. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Let's go to JR  A lot of people have comments Anthony JR. You're next on any w  Good my partner I worked in Staten Island on an ambulance about four or five months ago  We put an inappropriate bell on the dashboard  We broke the damn thing. I'm dying here  Yeah 
[99:00]
 All right, thank you  Bye  One guy's pissed off because the song was dumped out of too much. Oh, yeah  Let's let's go to PJ PJ has an angle on this PJ. You're next on any w  It's TJ TJ. Sorry, you sent me the inappropriate though. Yeah. Yeah  There it is  It was perhaps the most offensive song I've heard but it was so fancy that it was funny  Yeah, that's true. So it gets so offensive that it goes all the way around in the spectrum and become funny 
[99:30]
 I think so  Going to see Paul bond tonight and if you get everybody go see me the funny guy, maybe he'll play it  Where's what where's our Paulie playing tonight? That's cool. All right, maybe he'll sing the song for everyone. Yeah, I doubt it  Yeah, all right. All right, PJ. Thanks. Bye a couple more. We'll move on Brian. You're next. What's up?  Damn boys, you're bleeding so again. I'm fighting myself  It was beyond brutal my god, you know, I'm pro-choice but I'm fun 
[100:00]
 No, like, you know think about that if you're not long  Wow, we might have changed people's opinion. We might have changed people's opinion on the whole issue with one song  Damn. All right, Brian. Bye  Trish what's going on? Well, I just called to say that that those guys are far from offensive. They're past the psychotic  Mode they need to have psychiatric  If they can write a song like that. All right, that was really sick. Cool super sick, especially when they said about the bones cracking 
[100:30]
 The great one I mean for a woman that's a pretty tragic thing to hear and believe it or not  We're trying to get more ladies to listen to our show. Oh, yeah, that'll help right there.

Oh, hey, we're doing all right  I tell you I'm 56 years old and that has got to be the most offensive thing I've ever heard  Not even song wise or anything just ever  Contest ends with this one. Yeah, maybe we should just end it right now  I really think I could live another 56 years and I don't think I'll hear anything as a friend  Well, if we're gonna end it you might as well play the winning song

You know what? I think if you're gonna have a contest don't you want the best of the best competing?  You don't want half-ass right?  So you got it. It's the most offensive song contest  You want the most offensive song not the most offensive song that was chosen to be played  Yeah, well wouldn't offend too many people  Defeats the purpose of the contest. Well, there's a lot of outrage today 
[112:30]
 Where where are all where were all these people when we played full-blown AIDS that song  That was the first entry  Wow, what are they doing lapsed calf?  John what's going on? Hey, how you doing? Great. That song is totally offensive. It makes killer kitten like a nursery rhyme  Yes, he killed him doesn't seem all that bad anymore doesn't  Got a lot of what do they they had postings on web boards about that, huh?

Thank you, John  Well enough of that for a while we have a responsible journalist here  That's where that's where it's come we saw your political commentary there on Super Tuesday  It's it said when my life when I am now almost mainstream. I'm gonna have to kill myself. Isn't that something you ever think? 
[113:30]
 Well, no, I never thought wait Lewis  We're putting you on the webcam if you don't mind no problem because people have heard you on our show many times  They would like to see what you look like this. Yeah, this will really help  These are actually in my head. I wear them all the time  It's a them and really big ugly boots  It's wnew.com go to the opium Anthony section. There's a link to the it's called the spaz cam and 
[114:00]
 At least that puts me in a category I can do this is supposed to responsible journalist  What did when did you come up with welcome?  Compared to a word on the past hour this show to this show. I'm becoming like the John Chancellor if he were alive  Yeah  Exactly, it's insane. That's what we're talking about. Just roll what you are is directly proportional to the situation you're in  So, you know  Unbelievable when you're here, I don't know how much worse it can get than being on the show 
[114:30]
 And he still has no clue what just when I swear to you. He has no idea  I'm not I want to hear this thing during the break though. All right, very bad  Oh, yeah, well, I did'll help me. Yeah, I need my eyes opened  I passed a guy coming on the way over though. It was like perfect because since this is bright and sunny the nuts are out  Yeah, this guy sitting wearing it  It's I came around the corner and say a black man with an afro, which is makes it what?  1967  Sitting on the corner of 43rd Street with a sign that says insult me for a dollar 
[115:00]
 You saw a lot of people been talking about how it was great  And  You know, he'll probably make a lot of money he's performing a service unlike a lot of people that just sit on the sidewalk looking  For cash. It's a service. Yeah terrific service. You give him a ten and tell him I'm gonna be here 
[115:30]
 Screw the box  That which is right across from that World Wrestling Federation restaurant, which just makes my block of peach  When I think food I think big sweaty guy  That was a theme restaurant waiting for you know, nobody yelled, you know  They got upset about Disney and then which was fine  And but then these other things are moving in and nobody it's like it's like they broke our back 
[116:00]
 You know  And then insane amounts of junk in the window we are lunchbox and action  Unconscionable I was like literally it felt since yesterday that I'm walking around and somebody else's planet  I don't belong here anymore. Things are passing me by  And then an Applebee's on 42nd Street nobody said that's wrong  Somebody said, you know, no, we don't need that. You know, what is it a neighborhood pub? Yeah 
[116:30]
 It's a neighborhood  I want to come to New York and eat in a place that I could eat at, you know at the strip mall  You got to go up a flight to get there to probably have handicap access up the was  Do you have one of those apartments where the neon lights come right into your place no  But it's close now with that jumbo thing that they got on 43rd now that thing about I guess it's ABC  Yeah, but it's kind of neat though because it's like since I don't do drugs. It's a great you come out of the apartment 
[117:00]
 This is big huge  So you can't tell what it is so you kind of feel disoriented it's great time  There is get amazing and then there's that kind of neat. So that might as well be a sign  Oh, you're not involved in this screw you  Put your stuff in the chump change  Down there with the idiots you're in the farming group 
[117:30]
 This they had a scary image on the jumbotron a couple days ago  Katie Kerik's colon. Oh, did they put that up there? Well live on the Today Show. I'm serious  I heard a few people hit the building thinking they were at the entrance  Katie's calling I almost drove into the jumbotron. I love that and then they'll come and then they'll yell about what you do  It's like taking they have no sense of taste anymore, but they don't know they have no sense of taste  They think they're doing a service and it's news to stick a camera of Katie Kurtz 
[118:00]
 Backside and show the world her colon and you know what it made me want to do  It made me want to leap down to my doctor and get one of them  I've had one already and you know, I thought oh, yeah  I gotta get another one and this is really gonna make me go do it. Yeah, you know, why are you nuts?  Because Katie did it Katie did and it's creepy, you know and why and hello  Why isn't Katie doing something like can we do this? Can we find another way? Hello? Yeah, you got a phone  That's an inch high. Can't we come up with something that you can go in the kazoo bird without? 
[118:30]
 You know doing damage. I don't think that's right. It's like an octopus  It is like that Roto-Rooter thing, you know, you can think of in my diet when I had it done  My doctor was like boy. This is great. It's just clean as a whistle. Take a look  No, no, no, no, no, no, thank you. Yeah. I see commercials all the time, you know with fiber optics  Information can fly from point to point over a wire. That's thinner than a human hair. Yeah 
[119:00]
 Well, can't they put a camera at the end of that exactly and stick it up there?  No, it's got to be something like a tree trunk  Coming up there. Yeah, really? It just doesn't make you know  They did say that everything is kind of like you'd completely askew at this point. Yeah, and I don't think it's coming back  Mmm, yeah  Times Square looks like a scene out of Blade Runner now, doesn't it with all the video screens and everything?  I just don't know how those people work though with the lights just flashing through that, you know  It's over their office buildings and stuff now  Yeah  And then it's great cuz I'm there so there you know 
[119:30]
 You've got that at one end of the universe and where I'm living is a fifth floor walk up where which I think  I wish a kid would turn she would presented as a diorama as a science project  I  Got off the top  Bring it to the gym and go I around my look at what I grew here in 95 years  Look at it here. Here's a plant that must have started in 1902  When someone peed in the corner because there probably wasn't indoor plumbing.

[129:00]
 Let's talk them really fast Anthony from the most offensive song Anthony  Yeah, he wrote the Barry Manilow first one to come in after full-blown AIDS right Anthony  What do you have to say today?

[130:30]
 Tom Rokha I'm missing nightly news what you just heard McCain say was I can't understand him telling me what the game just said  McCain is cheating to me  playing a long face  Still the funniest thing ever said

[134:00]
 We're gonna have a drug-free America this is the route yeah, you know, you'd like audio narcotics  Yeah, exactly. That's what anybody I think you're coming close  So you want to talk politics a little bit you must have some thoughts on what occurred the last few days what occurred is  utterly the worst  The worst case scenario is that we can spend 250 million dollars and be nowhere  This is just the most we can save the money right that's all you may be offensive but what occurred 
[134:30]
 You know with that with what's occurring right now with just Bush now, we're left with the two of them  That's offensive  Lived on this planet this long end up and that's the best if that's the best we can do  Give me a stick and I'm poking out my eye. That's insane  Look at that. Did you do they both so creepy one is out of a pod and the other one is  He's out of a pod. I want to know where the pod is for me  But that didn't you do Al Gore Al Gore worse than Al Gore when he was not peppy is this new kind of 
[135:00]
 And I was hello happy  When he speaks that's like somebody's giving them an animal  Excited he can't get excited. He's socially retarded the other one is socially retarded  I'm watching the two of them sitting side by side thinking this is like it's some handicap festival  He's looking at she's looking at that even how to look 
[135:30]
 Natural anymore we supposed to really get like stomach this  I've been in politics so long, you know, you don't even know how to how to act like a human being  I would rather just get one of those robot dogs  Is that what they do with the wives of these candidates that have to stand next to the podium and give a  Stepford wife. I'm on friggin heroin look at the husband because I'm like McCain his wife looking at him  I swear to God I thought at some point her head would roll right off her body 
[136:00]
 It looked like she was on drugs like she was drugged out  Yeah, no, she does and that was the best. Yeah, the best thing yesterday was when was that  McCain yelling at Maria Shriver. Yeah  That was great get out of here, but you knew that but that's the thing that there's there's the little you know that little snap box  Nobody wanted to talk about  He ran and I kept insane in the act this you know, it's the guys in North Vietnamese prison camp 
[136:30]
 Yeah for six years. Can we discuss that for a minute?  No, no, no, no  You know, you know me my friends who went over there for a year and they're still like, you know  They're dragonflies come in the yard near to you know, they're hiding in the roots  So let's get a grab  I mean for crying about just insane  You know, I just got sent for the reason for reasons of discussion  You have to have to bring it up to bring it up. What did you do door? 
[137:00]
 How did it affect you psychologically? It's gonna work. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think it means?  Well, we were hoping McCain was gonna be our next president because we knew he would snap eventually in the White House  You know and had a great line about the Rose Garden turning it into a rice pad. I felt he would just  Rototill the Rose Garden plant rice patties and just sit there with maybe a mounted 50 cal out the side window of the White House  And pick off a few of the gardeners for all time  Oh 
[137:30]
 You know if he got any further and you have to go on the campaign trail further and you know how they love kissing babies  I would love to see him in an Asian community pick up a baby and just bite its throat out  Oh 
[138:00]
 Hey put that to music I think we got another entry  The new tune goop baby climbing up the jives that American 
[138:30]
 McCain just checked in he is supporting the fetus song  Now we can't get dropped out today, right? I mean yeah, it was sort of a half-assed dropout  He said for now, you know, he's dropping out of the race. I think he wants to run as an independent at this point  I think he's gonna load up and try to kill Bush and jump back into the frame 
[139:00]
 I think he thinks maybe Bush might accidentally put himself in the electric chair kill himself  You know, I can't pardon myself either. It was a paperwork glitch. It says I have to be put to death  I  Gotta do it. I can't look weak. Gotta do it. Yeah, I have to electrocute myself. Gotta do 
[139:30]
 Yes, so we're left with them gore and Bush and Bush and now Pat you can't have my other favorite  It's his personal favorite of mine the man the man who the only man who likes it there more than Hitler like  Well, man, I really you know, he's so misunderstood  Understood  It always makes me know the road it I go, you know, you gotta bring it up  I go, you know, I'm Jewish and then you can hear the hush come over  Gets a little laugh like 
[140:00]
 He gets to run, you know to miss the bug that's the best we do for a third party. Yes. Yeah, he's him  I mean that you'd be pick a cartoon character  anyway  clutch cargo makes more sense  I love him  You know and then the NRA would have someone to really support and there's a group of there's another group of  Swedish those guys, you know, but the but that thing with 
[140:30]
 With Buchanan, I speak Buchanan is easy. See if you don't think that Pat Buchanan is psychotic  Okay  If you can't pick it up on your own with your own ears  Go out and get a dog and when he's on when Buchanan's on TV put the dog in front of it and watch the dog  Spin around in circles and try to bite its own ass  And eventually it'll pee itself and probably pee urine. I'm just telling you that might change your vote 
[141:00]
 All he needs is the little mustache  He's got that lefty lips instead of going expelling your ha ha ha ha ha like a normal you mean he's like  It's actually sucking it in which is actually  He's the third candidate. Yeah, that's perfect  It's like why you know and it's now we got months of this ahead  Yeah, you know this before was somebody god. It was somewhat interesting, you know, it's somewhat interesting 
[141:30]
 He said Bradley might as well just eat in his own body  I  Poor guy I really wanted  He had a fashion consultant or some kind of boss person that tells him how to look I know look and act I mean  You know, it's like come on speak  Something you know, but he should have just literally she'd you should have started the first state in Hampshire should have chopped up his hand and just eaten  That would have been New Hampshire and then he got to the next state South Carolina 
[142:00]
 Take another chunk of his arm  And I liked it yeah  The slots with that big issue health care, which everybody just leaps on  Because you know who really loves you, you know, there's the people who really have a voice in this country the people who don't have health care  People do have it don't even want to discuss  I'm okay. I'm paying enough already. I don't need to pay for anyone. I got my co-payment 
[142:30]
 I  Get it go, you know, if you really cared you'd that job you wouldn't be a temp you little pig  You do something with your life. It's unbelievable. No health care in this country. And then I love the fact today  You know it then shows her so now health care set back a hundred years  Yeah, you know because he is now he's ruined it forever pretty pretty close  They're nobody's gonna even like touch that issue at all and I just like stupid  I mean, I don't have health the thing is is it you know for a long time? 
[143:00]
 About here cuz I'm a comic we don't have what we got a union  Yeah, you know, what am I gonna get together with Shecky Green and Mal C Lawrence?

What'd you do?  Really you don't know I had a I had a cool New York Jets jersey on and I was going to elementary school 
[150:00]
 Yeah, pretty cool. I know I'm just about to be goof  I don't think the woman was I goofing on the Vietnam War effort. Yeah, no, I don't think the goof from the mom  What did I go for them? No, I was goofing on McCain. We never said the war was a  McCain he spent five and a half years  We had an opportunity to leave  We've discussed that part of it too, man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well you didn't give enough attention to it 
[150:30]
 All right. Well, you can't do a setup and discuss that and then go  It's simple. The whole thing's a joke, right? No, it's not a joke  Get the fact that the bottom line when it comes to humor is every so often somebody gets hurt sometimes  Yeah, right. I do I do get the bottom. Okay, you know what?  I listen to Stern do his goose and I listen to these guys. You know what they start to like, you know, really  Beat me off. All right  Thank you, Nicky, thank you Nicky 
[151:00]
 All right, okay, that's a beat opiate Anthony die  And a double take a promo out of that  Eugene, you know, what's up? Eugene? What's going on boys? Hang with Lewis black today. Yeah  Yeah, let me answer a question. What do you think about that stupid bitch?  Think you just saying calling her a stupid bitch in the way you just did really made my week 
[151:30]
 Because I can't even get to that kind of voice you've got to really be to get up to good by cheese  Just another proof that you know, why didn't she marry the millionaire?  Yeah, you know and then she did you know she's doing this movie with her kid  Oh, yeah, she's dragging her kid into a movie. Yeah, have you seen the clip? Yeah. No, have you seen the clip of Cody yet? No  But I know no no the acting is horrendous  I'm sure it is and he looks like a fruit and waiting 
[152:00]
 Yeah, you know, I gotta say yeah roots war to become these moments away  Well, you know, you know, he's got no he's like that's it  He's that he's there if anybody could write a how to make your son gay book  It would be Kathy Lee everything she's done is a step-by-step  The thing to get your kid to grow up and a gay and I'm really glad that she's leaving that show where at least we have  her contained  Now she's gonna branch into her other things she's yet to give her time for other things a concert tour that opportunity to be on Broadway 
[152:30]
 Because she's movies. Yeah, sure. She's such a great singer and actress  Oh, yeah, I'm sure she's really worse after she does that TV show man  You know, the love boat isn't on the air anymore. Well, it will be now any gig that she would get  Jesus  You are disgusting psycho market he comes in with  Jokes about Cody Cody will be a Peter popper 
[153:00]
 It's gonna be pulling worms out of the ground I saw that clip though he's  Even in the picture it's it's yeah, I can hear him lisp now Kathy Lee is saying that us sex  Her and gift have had like sex is the way that they got their marriage strong again  And the trust back with gift if you remember when gift had sex with that woman in the hotel 
[153:30]
 What was his favorite kind of sex to have with the back door the blood?  I'm thinking Kathy Lee didn't want to give it up now that he was straight and then came back  She had to make some concessions. I'm thinking maybe now Kathy Lee takes it in the dumper  Yeah, and that's probably why she's leaving the show because she can't sit for an hour straight anymore  I  Amable or not  Give tagging her. All right, let's go to the center and I'll play quarterback 
[154:00]
 Thank you  Yeah, what do you think about this darvish?  I can't she has she fulfilled her 15 minutes of fame yet. She had a little time left to go  Well, then your your brother died the other day so I had to hear about that  You know, that's what I really wanted to do is now that I now that I've got her in my face  Then I got to hear that she's got a brother with cerebral plug. I gotta wake up and read that with coffee  Like what is that? What what does that have to do with anything? Then I got to think about people with cerebral palsy 
[154:30]
 Which is terrible, but you know, it's but it's like what you you you know, it's disgusting  And what is she thinking anyway?  You know, why don't they just they should have brought her on and they should have just you know an interviewer  They have an adult come out and slap her  Somebody like in their 60s because what is the matter with you?  You're in your you're in your early 30s you there's you are troubled and they just back her a couple of times  And then can you see you have anything to say this is she opens her mouth hit her again 
[155:00]
 It's it's appalling. It's you know, and then and then I said but I'm thinking of Rick Rockwell  Maybe the guy running for vice president  You know, he's got almost enough credentials  To the hundredth power and  And and why not?  What about how to find a vice president and yeah, I haven't stand out there and have 50 people  Get a couple of questions and we'll cut it to ten  well my my dream ticket would be Gore and 
[155:30]
 Clinton as vice president and then Gore resigns day one  We get more years of that funny son of a bitch bill Clinton in office. That would be unbelievable  What there's probably something in the Constitution and I believe it's a bill though to get around something like that  I don't care what I got to do  She's approval ratings at 67% because he hasn't done a goddamn thing in a year at least a year  He's done nothing saying French. You're next on any w with Lewis black 
[156:00]
 French  Frank Frank it says French. Hey, I'm sorry  I  Tell you French nation  Spaz he can't spell Frank  Now he's changing a name on the screen to Frank. Thank you Spaz. All right, dad talk to Lewis. What?  Mm-hmm. I gotta ask you what do you think about the cars?  Hey, that was a good story Bill Cosby. I miss that invited some  20 20 year old actress that has done some work on his show non-speaking parts to his apartment 
[156:30]
 In New York for dinner to discuss her career and how she can advance her acting advice, right?  Turns out she calls the cops because Bill Cosby at one point took her hand and shoved it down the front of his sweatpants  I'm sure allegedly  Well, that's what the report said the police report said so on yeah now, of course, she's sewing and stuff  I'm you know, I'm not a big fan of Bill Cosby 
[157:00]
 But you got a question what she's doing if she's spending hours at his private place  Well, it may have been a punchline to a joke. We don't know  You know, he may have spoken of it, you know  You know how they say black men have really big ones  Well, you know here boom and then you know, whatever the setup was and the punchline was his penis  You work with audio visual aids sometimes maybe when she asked what was your inspiration for fat Albert  Yeah, and he just wanted to show her but I'll have Albert McConaughey. What are you thinking? What is she think? 
[157:30]
 You know, I'm gonna go. Oh, yeah dinner and drinks with Cosby by himself  Yeah, you know what, you know, are you thinking what could possibly? Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm sure he's going to discuss that with me  I'm sure what we're gonna do. They'll bring out the Stanislavsky book  Yeah, and we'll talk about acting. Well, obviously she got caught up in the whole thing thinks  He's really dr. Huxtable for something and he's no he's just a horny old man  Has a 20 year old in his apartment and he wants to get a little but the thing I think about Cosby is you see 
[158:00]
 You know, you know, that's what he needs is me, but he really needs more money  Because I don't think he really has enough cash. You don't think no, it's  It's unbelievable to me, you know, I mean, I just think he should have another show and  And probably get you know a website where we just send him money  I don't think he's got enough cash and now obviously collected all the cash and now he's looking for who she could  Go on all right. Let's go to Brian Brian. You're next in W any W 
[158:30]
 I don't have my bullhorn. Yeah, we don't have the Mike Tyson bullhorn today. Sorry.

 Man, I think we have time for one more here  Yeah, hey guys, I like your show a lot. Hey, thanks Lewis  I was wondering if you heard story yesterday yesterday about a fender bender where a lady and rear-ended a guy  But it was really not not a big deal  But he became so enraged he got out of his car went over to her car grabbed her dog and threw it into oncoming traffic  Whoa and killed the dog. This is a huge story in California, right Peter? Yep. That's right. Yeah guy gets  You think that's justified?  Justified 
[163:00]
 Good someone write a song about that. The contest is still on most offensive song  Happened where in LA. Yeah, what happened was it was a little road rage incident in LA. I believe I think that's remarshal law and shut it down  The whole city down. That's what I feel  Those I drove there about a week ago and no they should shut the whole place down  It isn't say it really and then force those idiots to walk. Okay, he's the one he snapped for the whole class has to stay after  No one gets a car 
[163:30]
 You've got to go from place to place by foot like in the old days  You little pigs if you don't know how to drive a car and your concept is I'm gonna drive for 16 hours a day  Well, then you can't do the privilege. Well, the whole class is punished. That's the way it works  As far as I'm concerned they go to hell. I was driving two hours a day. They're psychotic  It is insane to drive out there  You know, we have our Blake Long Island Expressway and sure that's complete madness, but it's just a part of the chunk here  This is like forever four to five hours of driving and you're still in the same place that 
[164:00]
 That's when you drive two hours  You should be in another state and try to get over six lanes of traffic to get to your offering  That's the good  As they announce, you know about 30 seconds before yeah. Yeah, now you got to go six lanes  Oh, was it a poodle or something?  Did you guys get the details unless it was a little fender-bender?  All right, the guy has road rage and the lady sitting there  She rolls down a window the guy starts screaming at her and her little poodle or whatever  jumps on her lap the guy grabs a dog and  Wow 
[164:30]
 That is all  Pretty heinous may not have had me may have had a poodle that you know that you know  You know got in his face in the past. Well, you know something in his face  Oh, it looks like a Bichon  Now he's shown for his a one of those lap dogs. Oh my kid, and then they got to show the picture of the dog  Yeah  Like the dead dog, yeah  You know  Services for fluffy will be hell's a B show. Yes, my sister used to have one of those 
[165:00]
 I wanted to throw it into traffic. I swear to God  Well, you know something she must have really done something bad for a guy to want to grab her dog and throw it into traffic  I've I've been in situations where I want to throw the driver into traffic  Yeah, probably driving with the dog on its lap. Give mommy kisses. Give me kisses and mommy drive through the green light  And you get into a little fender bender and throw the dog out into traffic, huh? That's unbelievable  Hey Mike, what's going on? 
[165:30]

She's beautiful, man  Beautiful. Can anyone else confirm that out there? 
[166:00]
 How's the traffic just slow down?  Usually when you're in traffic and you're waiting forever  You're just praying for blood and guts because you're so pissed off because you waited so long. That's something I would say, okay  Alright, thank you Mike. All right. Bye  Sex on the side of the northern state tonight exit 32 Sean. What's up? Hey, how you doing all day? You guys suck

[171:30]
 Love to hear that one. All right, Andy. Thank you  belong  I don't know of any alternate routes, but I know where his route is right now.  Tell you the truth, wow, going at it, traffic back up. 
[172:00]
 A lot of rubber necking going on, that's just in the car.  Her neck looks like rubber the way it's bobbing up and down.  Well, we'll be back, traffic on the ones, and DJs on the two.  Now that's what I call a traffic jig.  He's jamming her in traffic.  John, you're next on N.A.W. What's up?  Hey, what's up, O.N.A.?  How are you?  Alright. Yeah, I checked it out. I seen it on the highway there.  You saw the sex on the side of the road too, huh? 
[172:30]
 Yeah, it was crazy. I thought you guys were starting up some new thing like having sex wherever or something.  Well, yes it is. It's have sex Thursday.  Have sex Thursday.  Have sex anywhere you damn well please Thursday.  Right now we want all our listeners to stop doing what they're doing and have sex.  All you're going to see is people on the side of the highway having sex.  Alright John.  Alright man.  Thank you. I guess it's happening, Anthony.  Yeah.  We need a brave soul with a car phone to stop behind him and get an exclusive interview with a couple having sex on the Northern State Parkway. 
[173:00]
 Alright, well...  Hard power, John.  Anthony, you want to get back to the most offensive song contest?  Well, it is the current contest we're running here on our show, the most offensive song ever written.  We've had some entries that have just been brutal.  The last of which that came in from Air Sick, the abortion song.  Don't even know what to say about it. It is probably the most offensive song you'll ever hear.  Which officially is in the lead at this point. 
[173:30]
 Yeah, yeah.  Preliminary voting being in. It seems to be running away with only a small percentage of the precepts checking in.  Just running away with this thing is really going to take an offensive effort to dethrone this song.  But I have faith in our sick perverse listeners. They'll come up with something that'll beat it.  So we have another contender.  Yes, we do. Let me just see if this guy's real.  A guy that is walking behind a couple having sex. 
[174:00]
 Pete!  Are you really near the couple having sex on the...  Yeah, man. I'm on exit 432.  Alright.  On the Northern State. I'm walking right up to them.  Are you really?  Yeah, hang on a minute.  Alright. If anyone's in the area, please beep.  I don't know if this is...  Yeah, I'm intending not to believe this. But we will say.  Yeah, man. Hold on. They just looked at me. 
[174:30]
 How did Don't Be Cursing?  No, I'm not cursing.  You said, what the F?  Oh, I did. I'm sorry, man.  Alright, man.  Oh my God.  Alright, Pete.  Alright, later.  Good try.  Yeah. Great.  Alright, so where were we?  Oh yeah, most offensive song.  Most offensive song ever written.  Started with full-blown AIDS.  And boy, the people really took up the challenge.  Been writing some truly offensive and tasteless songs. 
[175:00]
 The Barry Manilow most offensive song was in the lead.  Good one. A lot of racism in that one.  A lot of... a little of everything in that one.  Another one, How Much Is That Darkie in the Window,  that was played earlier on today's show.  A little monotonous, repetitive, but very offensive.  And shocking.  Yes, and shocking.  That was from Jeff, who calls himself Fuel, I believe.  Fuel.  Okay.  And then, Jesus Christ.  A song that...  Billy and Paul from Airsic Productions checking in with 
[175:30]
 what could be the most offensive song ever written, the Fetus song.  Kill a Fetus.  Kill a Fetus.  We were shocked, stunned, and thoroughly entertained.  And now, we have a new entry.  Yeah, we have another entry from Fuel.  Oh yeah? Jeff.  Same guy?  Jeff, aka Fuel, the guy who...  Heading his bets, sending in two.  Who wrote How Much Is That Darkie in the Window?  Well, hold on to your hats, people.  All right. 
[176:00]
 Do you want me to...  I should give the name of the song, I guess, huh?  I guess you want to intro it, like a CBS-FM jacket?  That's your gig. Here we go.  I don't know the name of the song.  Oh, here it is, Anthony.  Okay.  Here it is, Harry Sack.  Harry Sack with you, CBS-FM.  This one coming in by a new artist, Jeff.  Ladies and gentlemen, on CBS-FM, we premiere this song, Baby Raper. 
[176:30]
 CBS.  Baby Raper by Jeff.  I like to dip my stick 
[177:00]
 And how I always talk about the game  I met that little hearty John today  I wish that thing could somehow understand  I'm just an average, ordinary man 
[177:30]
 Who somehow they just can't seem to get  While Maggie Simpson always makes me wet  Baby Raper  I'm a baby Raper  Sweet and young, good enough to eat 
[178:00]
 Baby Raper  I'm a baby Raper  The youngest cherries always taste so sweet  I pick my state up at the Disney Store  When mommy turns away, I go for more 
[178:30]
 Sing them songs, tell them that they're sweet  As I slip a little, booty's on their feet  Baby Raper  I'm a baby Raper  The sweet and young, the good enough to eat 
[179:00]
 Baby Raper  Baby Raper  I'm a baby Raper  The youngest cherries always taste so sweet  Baby Raper  I'm a baby Raper  The sweet and young, the good enough to eat 
[179:30]
 Baby Raper  I'm a baby Raper  That's the judge 
[180:00]
 Hold it, wait a minute  Whoa!  Okay  Okay, now  Yeah, we got us a contest now, don't we?  Alright, listen, we got a winner, Steve is saying  We want the people to vote that have heard both songs today  Or all three songs, I should say, alright?  A lot of people coming in 
[180:30]
 I take it back, this song beats the fetus song  Worse than the fetus song  Oh my god  Just coming, ding ding ding, winner  They're calling it the JonBenet song, unofficially  It's definitely a toe-tapper  Alright, let's go to Antonio on line one, Antonio  What?  Anthony  Hello  Yeah, you're on the air, let's go  No, that topped it all  That topped it all, I'm sorry 
[181:00]
 I just recorded the whole thing on my computer  I recorded it on my TV, my stereo  That's it, and it's a toe-tapper  Have you heard all the songs today?  I heard them all  And you think that's the one?  That's the one  Alright, thank you, sir  By the way, I'm the guy who ate the Twinkies  Oh, right on, I remember you  Yeah  From the road show, cool bro  Alright, take it easy  We'll see you soon, alright?  In the gate  This year's Grammy for the most tasteless and offensive song going to Baby Raper 
[181:30]
 F'ing sick, man, Jeff has problems  All these coming in like crazy  Baby Raper, the worst song ever, ever  Let's go to Phil, Phil, you're next  Phil  It's Bill, I got it wrong  Sorry, what's up, Bill?  I'm going to be singing this song all night long  We were humming that all day before the show today  Baby Raper, I'm a baby Raper  I heard all three songs, by far the best 
[182:00]
 Wow, wow, I didn't think anyone was going to beat Airsick  It's toe-tapping, it's funny, and it's offensive  What more can you have?  Wow, alright, thank you  Let's go to Steve  Steve, you're next on NAW  Hey, guys, end the contest, it's over  We got a winner, man  But that's what you guys said about the song before this  I don't want to hear it if it's three words again  Really?  I don't want to hear it  That could be the line  Alright, thank you, Steve 
[182:30]
 Alright, man, indication yet?  Oh, sorry  I didn't think there could be anything that beat the Fita song, but holy S, this does it  Winner, Baby Raper  I didn't mind hearing this song, I minded hearing the abortion song  Well, they're offensive in two different ways  I think the Fita song is more disgustingly offensive  But this song, just wrong, just completely wrong  Alright, let's go to Craig, Craig, you're next  Third round TKO, this one just took it on the chin 
[183:00]
 Wow, okay  Wow  By far the most hilarious song I've ever heard  Funny people thinking it's... see, look at this, Baby Raper, the most vile, cruel, sick, and funniest song I've ever heard  You know, he had the emotion down too, you know  It's a total, you will find yourself, you'll wake up three in the morning  Baby Raper, I'm a Baby Raper  Play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again 
[183:30]
 Wow, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait  Let's talk to the songwriter  Jeff aka Fuel, what's up?  Hey guys  Wow, look at this, a standing ovation  Your first entry, how much is that darkie in the window?  Didn't get great reviews, but man, the second one, the follow-up track 
[184:00]
 Yeah, sometimes the first song they put out isn't really the hit  I should explain though  A B-side hit  My original entry was supposed to be Baby Raper  In the middle of writing it, I got the idea for the other one  So I decided, what the heck, let's write that one and throw it on there too  It was always all about Baby Raper  Well, it was always all about Baby Raper  Well, at this point, not all the voting's in, but it looks like you're taking over the fetus song  You're climbing  I was afraid I was going to have to top the fetus song, I was afraid of what I might do 
[184:30]
 I was frightened for myself  All right, Fuel, Brian, Staten Island, Baby Raper, winner by knockout  They are loving this song, the ultimate offensive song and it has a melody  Grammys, here we come  It's subversive, that's the best thing  I'm afraid somebody might lay in bed tonight singing that to themselves, it makes me crack up  Baby Raper made me crap my pants  Look at that, that's something for the album cover, a little promotional sticker 
[185:00]
 We might have to put a couple of these songs on our next CD  Cool  Baby Raper has stuck in my head faster than Karma Chameleon  Does it beat We Deliver Keggers though as a catchy tune?  As catchy? It rivals that as a catchy tune  I'm just scared to check the mail tomorrow, Anthony  Let's talk to Kevin, Fuel's brother, I believe  Oh no  Kevin  You sick ass  Uh oh  Memo to self, when I have kids, bring them to daycare 
[185:30]
 Hey dude  Mom's proud my friend, mom's very proud  I bet  All I ever want to do is make my mom happy  Hey Kevin, did you think your brother had it in him to write lyrics like this?  Well I always thought so, but I kind of put those thoughts to the side  But I guess, in the end  Alright, we might have to have Jeff aka Fuel at our next roadshow to sing that live  I can see 1400 people down  Oh my god  Baby Raper 
[186:00]
 I'm a Red Raper  Wait, I'm sorry, there was going to be a hand clapping sing along part in the middle of it  Did you, I hope you didn't mind me throwing in the baby crying over some of the key parts  That's classic  I was helping out, a little assist, I'm like a mix master  Yeah, we're like Fatboy Slim, remixing stuff  Boosting it up a little  Okay  That's cool  Well Kevin and Jeff, I guess we gotta let you go  But Jeff, it's almost safe to say that you're in the lead as far as the most offensive song 
[186:30]
 Alright, well if anybody beats me I'm just going to have to, I don't know, shrink or something to come up with something worse  Alright, it's just a knockout blow, unexpected coming in because everyone thought the Fita song was a runaway winner and that was it  Now, I mean, this is just getting rave reviews  Can I just say one thing to my brother?  Yeah  Jeff, you've always been my big brother, I've always looked up to you  You begged me when I was wrong, but I've never been prouder  Alright guys, thank you  See you later guys  Alright 
[187:00]
 Later  Not only offensive, but you can hum to it  Checking in, people enjoying it  David, you're next on NAW, what did you think of the song?  That is the funniest damn thing I've ever heard in my life  And the sad thing is that at about 3.30 in the morning I'm going to wake up and I'm going to be hearing that and Carmichaeli in my head  Yeah, you're going to be taking that middle of the night leak and you're just going to be there  I can walk for the next three weeks  I mean, I'm at work and I just got my Walkman back on and I had to hear that thing and I almost had a hemorrhage  People walk by my workstation and they're like, what the hell are you rapping at?  I was like a freak, I mean, here with one headphone in one ear, passing out, like trying not to have a stroke 
[187:30]
 And putting the baby sound in there, it was brilliant  Look at this email coming in from all the way from Boulder, Colorado, my daddy used to sing me to sleep with that song  Oh, Mel, you're next on N.E.W.  Hey guys, that was the sickest f'n thing I've heard  I almost pissed my pants at work  I'm telling you, I thought the Fita song was good, just beat them all 
[188:00]
 Very surprised at the voting, I didn't think anything was going to beat the Fita song, Anthony  Yes, very surprised, but if anything should, this one should  It could be the most offensive song I've ever heard  Alright, Tom, real fast, what do you got?  Guys, stick the fork in me and I'm done, man, that was it  I just got off the Petchy Pike, got to the Jersey Pike  I heard that, I was, oh man, I'm driving all over the road, it's great  It brought me memories back about being in the Marine Corps with babies and stuff  Oh my God, and you heard the other entries, right? 
[188:30]
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, the darky one, that one, he outdid himself  I don't even know how to explain it  Alright, into the table  Thank you  Guy?  Sorry, sorry, a couple more and we'll move on here  Eric, what's up?  Not much, man, I got to vote for the Fita song, I think the Baby Raper song was right on  I'm kidding, I'm kidding, that song was out of control  Alright, you like the Baby Raper song  Definitely  Okay, thank you 
[189:00]

[190:00]
 Woo!  The other rhythm mates think I'm kinda sick  Because of where I like to dip my stick  And how I always talk about the day  I met that little heart each other day 
[190:30]
 I wish that they could somehow understand  I'm just a marriage ordinary man  But somehow they just can't seem to get  While Maggie Simpson always makes me wet 
[191:00]
 Baby Raper  I'm a baby Raper  The sweet and young  They're good enough to eat  Baby Raper  I'm a baby Raper  The youngest cherries  Always taste so sweet

[195:00]
 O.T. and X-Men.  107-W-N-E-W  We gotta say hi to old Dirty.  Yeah, yeah.  O.D. stopping by.  O.D.  Stopping by the studio after a short absence.  We have him on the Staz Cam.  What up, what up.  What up. Say hi to all your peeps.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Antonis.  Hey man.  A lot of people commenting about the most offensive song, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[195:30]
 I don't think anyone's gonna beat Fuel. Fuel's effort there. Baby Raper.  Frank, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  I think you should kick it up a notch.  Kick it up a notch?  How the hell could you kick that up a notch?  Fasten your seatbelts.  Make the fetus song and the baby raper song.  Combine them and make it fetus raper.  Ha ha ha.  Yeah, that might do it.  That's where you get the whole necrophiliac kid having rapist angle.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Probably someone is on it already as we speak. 
[196:00]
 And I'm going to hell, so I'll talk to you guys later.  See you there.  We'll see you there.  We'll bring the beer.  We'll bring the beer.  Bob, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Yeah, I just want to know, is there a video for this baby raper song?  Oh my God.  Yeah, it's going to be on TRL.  TRL, right?  Yeah, making of the video.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Bob.  Bye.  All right.  Well, Nick wants to say that the fetus song is more offensive than the baby rapers. 
[196:30]
 Oh, wow.  Nick?  Add to clear, come victory for fetus.  Oh, yeah?  Absolutely.  All right.  Baby song is great, but no way you can beat the fetus.  All right, thank you, Mick.  All right, later.  Yeah, you guys.  Andy, hold on.  You guys need to vote.  On the answer feedback would be nice, really fast, if you saw.  But if you saw, if you heard both songs today, you know, the fetus song and the baby raper  song, please make your votes.  Make your votes.  Are all the precincts reporting as far as the voting? 
[197:00]
 Yeah.  We have a small percentage of precincts checking in, but yeah, before we get to that, Nick,  we're going to have to check in.  But yeah, before baby raping.  Before 7, we've got to decide what song is in the lead.  And like I said earlier, I'm scared to check the mail tomorrow.  Yeah.  It's just going to get ugly.  Lynn, what's up?  You're next on NAW.  Oh, and hey, oh my God.  Yeah.  I love you guys, but oh my God.  Did you say, did you say I loved?  No, I loved.  Oh, okay.  No, no, no, no.  I thought it was in the past tense, like, uh-oh.  It wasn't that bad, but no, my God, it's so out of control. 
[197:30]
 Well, we warned you guys.  sure if we were going to do the most offensive song contest and you guys encouraged us and  said, we'll understand, you know, what it's all about.  Oh my God.  Well, you know what it is?  Is I don't, I don't think you guys, you don't have kids, so you don't know how like offensive  that is.  Yeah.  Well, that's why we're, we're looking for the most offensive song.  Oh, that's got to take, you know, the fetus I heard that today, I was sort of pretty bowled  over by that one, but this one, my God, I have a baby.  It sounds just like that baby is crying. 
[198:00]
 All right.  Well, he goes here.  There it is.  There, there, there, there, there's the child.  You guys are psycho.  All right, thank you.  Take care.  Bye.  Bye.  No, no, no, no.  Don't shoot him.  I didn't do anything.  Uh, baby rapers definitely more addictive than crack.  Congratulations.  The instant feedback just spilling in and Rob, Rob from Stony Brook.  Guys, I am totally screwed. 
[198:30]
 My girl walked in and I have baby raper blast in and now I'm not getting laid for a month.  Heard all the songs.  This is a winner by far.  Ben from Garfield, baby raper, toe tapping little ditty that should be in the top 40,  a winner should be a Casey case and dedication to John Benet Ramsey's mother and father.  Oh man.  Where's the gun, the bell?  Matthew from Jersey today coming in at number one on the American top 40.  Everyone wants the Casey case of baby rapers. 
[199:00]
 Started as the most offensive song ever by a long distance dedication and has climbed the charts  number one for its fifth time.  Climbing the charts.  And now a little song dedicated to John Benet Ramsey.  Oh man.  It's a long distance dedication from daddy.  It reads Dear John Benet, I'm sorry I choked you with a rope and boned you right before your death.  Please accept this song as my little tribute. 
[199:30]
 It's called Baby Raper.  Nah, nah, nah.  Done.  Oh man.  Ponderous.  F'ing ponderous, man.  How the hell am I supposed to do a baby raper song and go into a goddamn up tempo number?  F'ing ponderous, man.  Let's go to Lisa.  Lisa, what's up?  How are you?  Hi.  What's up?  What's up?  I love when chicks do that. 
[200:00]
 So what's going on today, Lisa?  Well, I thought Baby Raper was highly offensive.  We didn't like the, I sent in a song that you didn't like it.  We're going through all the entries.  Oh, okay.  So we have to just pick a few every day.  So we...  Well, I know it's not going to be Baby Raper.  We played three today, so...  I know, I heard them all.  We'll have a few more tomorrow.  I haven't been off and I was going to tape it if you played it.  It's called Sand in My Crotch.  That's pretty funny.  It sounds interesting.  All right, Lisa, well have a great night, okay? 
[200:30]
 Thank you.  All right, Rick.  Bye.  You know, we've constantly got new people tuning in who may have missed the Kill a Feet  a Song.  Yeah.  Maybe you should balance this out a little bit.  That's too bad at this point.  Really?  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Mike, what's up?  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Baby Raper rules.  It rules?  But can I make a prediction?  Yeah.  I bet you it gets me fired from work tomorrow.  Why?  Well, I'm in that business where we install custom computer systems and I'm always humming  and singing while I'm working.  Yeah.  I'm going to be humming and singing that one and the client's going to walk in and that's  going to be it. 
[201:00]
 I'm going to be done.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Does that make us rule?  A song like that?  You guys rule.  Joe, very offended.  Joe, what's up?  Yo, ONA.  Hey.  I was listening to that Dorky on the Window.  Yeah.  I was in Pro Clip before and Ben Stylist did that song.  I thought it was really funny.  Yeah.  But this song, the Baby Raper, I have a three-year-old girl in it.  Like, it was making my blood boil.  Yeah.  I was listening to that song.  I was listening to that song.  I was listening to that song.  I was listening to that song.  I was listening to that song.  I was listening to that song.  I was listening to that song.  I was listening to that song. 
[201:30]
 Yeah.  I have a three-year-old girl in it.  Like, it was making my blood boil.  I don't blame you.  Yeah.  That's a bad one.  I mean, it's funny, but it really gets you crazy.  You know, I want to, like, spang on the guy.  We're not looking for funny.  We're looking for the most offensive.  And that certainly was.  I think we found it.  Hey, you guys are much better than Styr.  Thank you, Joe.  Take it easy.  Just an opinion, obviously.  Thank you.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Well, Ben's giving me the results here, Anthony. 
[202:00]
 About 10 to 1 for Baby Raper.  Yeah.  All precincts reporting, Ben.  Yeah.  Oh, the crowd just going wild for Baby Raper.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, we've had enough comments on Baby Raper.  Yeah.  Let's play a quick round of what did we learn on the Ophi and Anthony show, 2127571027,  as we clear the phone lines and get that going.  We got to say hi to Smelly Karen, Anthony.  Oh, wait.  Where's she?  We were supposed to talk to her about an hour and a half ago. 
[202:30]
 She's coming in tomorrow, I believe, old dirty.  You were listening to that, right?  Yes, the Roman Bath edition.  Yeah.  The Ophi and Anthony show.  We're going to bathe her.  We're going to bathe Smelly Karen.  Can I bring a hard bristle brush?  No.  Hard to eek areas.  Yeah, Smelly Karen, she's definitely a good looking lady.  I hear that.  Nice, nice brush.  Yeah, her.  But she has a slight, slight.  That's an understatement.  She has a little hygiene problem.  Just a little odor. 
[203:00]
 So tomorrow we're bringing in a kiddie pool.  Smelly Karen's going to stand in the middle of it.  And we got some really, really high babes with sponges and lots of soap that are going to sponge her down.  They're going to lather you up tomorrow, Karen.  And a few of these girls very interested in having a lesbian experience tomorrow.  So it could get pretty wild with Smelly Karen tomorrow.  It's going to be a wedding wild Friday here on ONA.  And she wrote me an email saying that she has a water fetish too. 
[203:30]
 What the heck is a water fetish?  Right Karen?  Yeah.  You get turned on by water, by taking showers.  I'm taking a bath.  So how the heck can you smell if you like the water?  I know, that's what I don't understand.  It has nothing to do with smell.  What are you talking about?  You better have a fetish for the soap, Karen.  How about soap fetish?  Hey ONA, can I ask you a favor?  Yeah, what?  After tomorrow, can I be stripped of my title of Smelly Karen, please?  Well, if the girls that sponge you down do a good job, I think we could talk about that, sure. 
[204:00]
 Okay.  But if you come out of that kiddie pool and you're still reeking, you know.  We can only do what we can do, you know.  What could I tell you?  The funkometer got to read zero.  And I'm sure if you end up in one of our road shows and we bring you up on stage, I don't think anyone would chant Smelly Karen.  No.  Smelly, Smelly, Smelly.  No one would do that.  I don't think anyone would do that.  I believe they would show you some respect and just chant your name.  Karen, Karen, Karen, right. 
[204:30]
 Oh, alter.  It makes a difference, guys, because I'm 20 and I'm not even allowed in your road show yet.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, man.  It gets hot under those lights.  Yeah.  These road shows smell enough.  That wouldn't be a problem for me.  Right, okay.  Yeah, they'd be stinking, Karen.  You're going to bring the level.  Oh, my God.  Oh, okay.  That's not fair.  All right, all right, all right.  So, is your boyfriend all into this?  Yeah, he's all open arms about this.  Oh, he's pissed off?  Yeah, because the thing is, is that like he thinks because he's a little bit of a jerk,  he's a little bit of a jerk.  He's a little bit of a jerk.  He's a little bit of a jerk.  He's a little bit of a jerk.  He's a little bit of a jerk.  He's a little bit of a jerk. 
[205:00]
 Yeah.  It's cheating for me to do this.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Nah.  Well, I'm all like, oh, man, it's like should I have the awesomest lesbian experience at  ONA or should I break up with my boyfriend?  Yeah.  It's like, ah.  Tough decision.  Yeah, it really is.  But I won't be breaking up.  Well, you're coming in tomorrow, right?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Bring that stuff in.  Oh, yeah.  Bring that stuff in.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Bring that soap, kids. 
[205:30]
 Oh, I can't.  Hey, do you have a preference for soap or shampoo?  Not really.  I just, no, not really.  No, huh?  Okay, well, I got contacted by somebody at Lever who was listening to the show.  Lever, the official sponsor of Smelly Cows.  And they just, I got the package in my mailbox just now.  What is it?  It's a box of soap.  Oh, we need cool stuff.  We need like a bubble bath.  Yeah.  I'm sure it's included in there. 
[206:00]
 She gave me a box.  Some scrub loofahs and stuff so she can really get scrubbed down.  Maybe we can get some brillos.  Like a metal brush.  It's like a feel brush.  It's like a bath kit.  Yeah.  And I know what we should have done with Smelly Karen.  Put her in the back of a pickup truck and send her through a car wash.  Oh, that would have been awesome.  Big word up.  Well, if the bath doesn't work, we'll try that next.  We won't give up on you.  No, not at all.  No matter how much you want us to. 
[206:30]
 Our goal is to get you clean.  Oh, good.  All right, so tomorrow's going to be a big day.  What time are you coming in for your bath?  About four o'clock, but I have to be out of there at like 530 because I have to be somewhere  six.  I think an hour is plenty of time to take it to...  We don't want to be pruning now.  Now, if your boyfriend's going to be pissed, you've definitely got to keep him home.  Well, I invited him...  No, no, no.  Guys always wreck the lesbian crap around here.  No, I invited him to come, but he said he had to work, but it doesn't even make a difference  because he doesn't get the station in where he works, so he's not going to even know. 
[207:00]
 All right, yeah, but please, please don't have him come down here and wreck our parade tomorrow,  okay?  Don't scrub the area where the smell is emanating from.  Yeah, yeah, Karen.  You really don't want me to shower.  No, Karen, come in smelly tomorrow.  Okay.  I want it off the fungometer, kid.  I'll walk from my dorm to the station.  How about that?  How about jogging?  I want to see if you're able to offend OD with your smell.  Yeah, yeah.  Neighborhood he comes from, it's going to take a lot.  Oh, my man, come on, man. 
[207:30]
 Man, there ain't no bell on this table.  Ding, ding, ding, bro.  Ding, ding, ding goes the trolley.  All right, Karen.  All right.  I guess we're done with you until tomorrow.  All right.  Tomorrow, big day for you.  All right.  We're going to try to get rid of your nickname.  Okay, yeah, right.  All right.  Bye.  Don't be, Karen.  Yeah, she's got to come in raking, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can we make a runner on the block or something, too? 
[208:00]
 Yeah, she got to run like from the dorm, son.  Put a milk dud in her butt.  OD, OD, let me tell you something.  It doesn't take much.  My man, word like that?  Oh, my Lord.  Oh.  Everyone smelled it the other day and no one was brave enough to say anything.  Antonis, is this true?  Yeah, you know.  I know.  You know.  All right.  Let's play a quick round of what do we learn on the Opiate Anthony show today.  Dennis from Newark.  Today I learned that people listen to Lewis Black for two reasons. 
[208:30]
 His jokes are so funny and number two, he's so on the edge you expect a blood vessel to  pop in his brain and kill him mid-ranting.  Very, very true.  Lewis Black, very funny.  He's playing The Stress Factory tonight at 8 o'clock in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  If you can't make tonight's show and we highly recommend you try to, he's got two shows tomorrow  and Saturday, 8.30 and 11 o'clock.  Okay?  Stress Factory, New Brunswick, New Jersey.  OD's checking out the picture, Anthony. 
[209:00]
 We started the show with that picture today, man.  But like one eye is bigger than the other.  Yeah, you see that?  Well, let me let everyone in on it again because the audience changes drastically.  There's, he's holding up a picture of a girl right after the money shot and it looks like  she has a really bad cold.  Yeah.  They're laying down rail behind Nick.  Laying down some track.  Yeah, that's something. 
[209:30]
 She's got a, I didn't notice the rest of the picture because I just thought it was her  face but look, there's some boobage and legs and look at that.  Look what's on her leg.  There's some more.  Yeah, yo.  Like it's all over her.  She got cream.  Yes, she did.  She was standing too close to the hose.  Looks like you beat her eye with it though.  What was turned on, man?  You can't look down that hose unless you know it's not on. 
[210:00]
 The lost milk mustache.  All right, listen.  Tom from Jersey.  What I learned today on the ONA show, raping babies, excuse me, is worse than scraping them.  Jason from Jersey learned that ONA fans are the sickest and most creative creatures in  the Tri-State area.  Well, that's very nice.  We take that as a compliment.  Thank you.  All right, let's go to Damon.  Damon, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned how to perform an abortion.  Oh, wonderful. 
[210:30]
 All right.  We got an outlaw metal cold hang is in this state.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, you're next on NAW.  Hey, I learned that exit 32 in a northern state would be better than Scores.  Yeah, it's better and cheaper than Scores.  Cheaper.  Much cheaper than Scores.  And I also learned if you're an alcohol president, you shouldn't eat Bavarian cream doughnuts  with that.  We like the obscure ones.  Thank you, Steve.  Oh, pity.  Yeah, we had a couple having sex on the side of the northern state today. 
[211:00]
 Yeah.  A couple more.  We've got to get out of here.  Tim?  Yeah, what's up?  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that tomorrow over two million people in the press area are going to be humming  Baby Raper.  Yeah, I believe a lot of people are going to be humming that in their sleep tonight.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Over and out, Diamond Duds.  Diamond Duds.  General, what's up?  Oh, hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I learned that Gary Glitter should do a cover of Baby Raper on his next album. 
[211:30]
 You guys got problems, man.  Yeah, we know that already, though, man.  All right, syndication out.  Burn in hell tomorrow, guys.  All right.  Over and out, Diamond Duds.  Sounds like a plan.  Rich, what's going on?  I learned that my aim was full.  I'm going to stand out until I'm ten years old.  I'm going to let them out the door.  That was sick.  Yeah, it was.  You're going to lock your baby indoors.  Yeah, I think so, at least for a while.  All right, thank you.  Syndication out.  All right, bye.  All right.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian?  Yeah, how's it going?  Good.  What's up?  I want to tell you what I learned.  I learned that I'm going to be singing Baby Raper. 
[212:00]
 I learned that I'm going to be singing Baby Raper.  I learned that if you want to buy the sweetest cherries, you've got to go to the Disney store.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  What happened when we were just having a psych?  Thank you, Brian.  Take care.  All right, let's go to Aaron.  Aaron, you're next on NAW.  Yo, what's up, guys?  How are you?  All right, I learned that I forgot everything that happened in the show.  Right after Baby Raper happened.  Yeah, no doubt.  We had some great stuff before that, too.  I also learned that the warm weather is pretty bad if you listen to that song when there's  a family of four next to you in a minivan.  Yeah, that's right.  I learned that I'm going to be singing Baby Raper.  Well, Anthony, I guess we could announce the results. 
[212:30]
 All precincts reporting.  I'm sorry to say, Billy and Paul, I know you're listening right now, but it's over.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah.  Oof.  You have been surpassed.  We didn't think it was possible today.  And that's a good one.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  I'm sorry to say, Billy and Paul, I know you're listening right now, but it's over.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah.  Oof.  You have been surpassed.  And that's a good one.  That's a good one.  But Baby Fetus is- 
[213:00]
 Baby Raper.  Yeah, Baby Fetus is done.  The new leader in the most offensive song contest.  It's a whole new administration.  Baby Raper by Fuel, aka Jeff.  We might have to leave the show with Kill a Fetus, give it one last play, one last minute  of glory before we move on with the content of the minivan.  I learned that Earl can't get laid or do any work.  Bob from Jersey.  Oof.  That goes way back to the beginning of the show.  Dan from Stanford, Connecticut. 
[213:30]
 I learned that Satan is holding a special place in hell for Jeff, aka Fuel.  Fuel rocks.  He had better come to the next road show.  Fuel?  And perform that song.  Well, we're going to try to do a road show in early April or mid-April.  Could you imagine?  We could have-  Thousands of fans screaming, I'm a Baby Raper.  Baby Raper.  We could have a bunch of these guys on stage performing their songs. 
[214:00]
 Maybe we'll use the road show as the grand finale.  We have the finalists.  The awards perform live and the listeners who are there judge.  We take the votes here and then compile them with the live performance votes.  Yeah.  Oh man, that's amateur night, kid.  Come on.  That's not amateur night.  That's not a bad idea.  Ripping off the Pino Theater.  I don't know if we can handle another three or four weeks of songs, but-  Yeah, that's true. 
[214:30]
 It's going to get ugly.  But yeah, it's not a bad idea.  What we could do is get four people and then we'll wait for the next road show and then  the listeners decide who wins.  We'll get finalists.  All right.  Is that chick going to show up at the next road show from the picture?  Atta girl, baby.  Hey Ray, you're next on NAW.  Thanks.  Hey, it looks like a thing of Elmer's glue blew up in her face.  Ray, you're on the radio.  Let's go.  Hey, I learned that Michael Jackson has an alias, Fuel.  Very good, Ray.  All right. 
[215:00]
 All right, man.  Take it easy, guys.  You suck.  All right, man.  Thanks for all the great phone calls today.  Thanks for listening to us.  Thanks to Lewis Black for stopping on by.  Word up, man.  He's funny, kid.  Yeah, I got to give him another plug because it's definitely worth it.  You're looking for someone to do and you're close to the stress factory in New Brunswick,  New Jersey.  Lewis Black on stage at 8 o'clock.  You're going to laugh.  I'm telling you, you're going to have a great time.  If you can't make it tonight, he'll be there tomorrow and Saturday for two shows, 8.30  and 11.  Yes.  And with that, Anthony, we are done-ski for the day. 
[215:30]
 Yeah, Donna Mike are next.  And well, the runner-up thus far in the most offensive song contest, Killifetus by Billy  and Paul.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.

We'll be right back.  I'm used to the crazy people.  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  Are you mental?  No!  It's our show!  I'm a madman!  I'm getting hit!  You sound like a stock-raising mad person.  I'm a madman!  I'm getting hit!  I'm getting hit!  I'm getting hit!  I'm getting hit!  I'm getting hit!  I'm getting hit!  I'm getting hit!

No, she's head, No!  No!  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  Call BMA in the name.  How can you tell who's sane and who's insane? </pre>
