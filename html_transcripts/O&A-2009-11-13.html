<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often employing highly offensive and misogynistic language, and homophobic slurs.  The show began with a scathing critique of Brooke Hunley, an ESPN employee involved in an affair, focusing heavily on her appearance and actions.  Audio clips from her Good Morning America interview were played and mocked relentlessly.  The hosts contrasted the media’s intense coverage of this affair with the comparatively scant attention given to a separate incident involving a black professor punching a white woman.

This segment transitioned into an equally harsh analysis of a Larry King Live interview with Carrie Prejean, a former beauty queen.  The hosts played numerous clips, mocking Prejean’s evasiveness regarding questions about a sex tape and lawsuit, speculating on the reasons behind her reluctance to answer, and frequently insulting her.  The role of Prejean’s publicist was also heavily criticized.  Numerous callers contributed to the negative and derogatory tone of the discussion surrounding both Hunley and Prejean.

The show then shifted to another female author and her poorly-performing book, despite a viral promotional video.  The hosts and Ann, a co-host, blamed her publicist for limiting her responses in a Larry King interview, again using highly offensive, misogynistic language.  The conversation abruptly changed to John Travolta, with homophobic slurs used while speculating about his sexuality based on a photograph.

A phone call with Tommy Lee followed, escalating into a heated exchange after the hosts brought up Pam Anderson, despite Tommy Lee’s claims his publicist instructed them not to.  The hosts used derogatory terms like "pussy" and "faggot" before Tommy Lee hung up.

The show then covered various news items, including Sharon Osbourne’s apology, circumcision trends, and a wife discovering her husband was a pedophile.  Upcoming guests Colin Quinn, Patrice O'Neal, and Brother Weez were mentioned.  Movie reviews of "Precious" and "2012" followed, alongside personal anecdotes, including Anthony's disturbing childhood fantasy involving a tiny naked woman, which prompted a caller, Lydia, to react on air.  John Cusack's use of profanity in a "2012" interview was also discussed, along with the 20th anniversary of "Say Anything."

Colin Quinn and Patrice O'Neal then arrived in studio.  The hosts engaged in lighthearted banter, including jokes about Colin Quinn’s weight loss. The discussion turned to Anthony’s disturbing childhood fantasy, again drawing attention to its potentially psychopathic implications, linked to Anthony's past confession about killing a salamander. This transitioned into a discussion of the video game *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, specifically its controversial "No Russian" level, with Patrice O'Neal and Colin Quinn sharing their reactions and opinions, alongside numerous callers.  The conversation expanded to the authenticity of *Faces of Death* and other disturbing content found online, concluding with the hosts being rickrolled.

The show included a segment on a graphic traffic accident caused by texting while driving, shifting to a rant about aggressive pedestrians in Manhattan, again featuring highly offensive language.  The hosts mentioned Colin Quinn's appearance at Caroline's Comedy Club and Patrice O'Neal's at Bananas, before playing an audio clip of a man masturbating during a 911 call.  A Boston caller criticized Patrice O'Neal's views on pedestrians, leading to a debate on pedestrian vs. driver responsibility.  Discussions on Lou Dobbs’ potential radio career and an incident involving boogers under the radio console (attributed to Eastside Dave) followed.

Bobo, a regular, attempted improvised characters at the hosts' requests, struggling initially under Colin Quinn's direction, then unsuccessfully portraying Barack Obama at Patrice O'Neal's direction.  The longest segment involved a heated debate between Brother Wheeze and Anthony about perceived liberal media bias regarding racial issues, touching upon 9/12 protests, Obama's presidency, and perceived hypocrisy from both liberals and conservatives, featuring frequent interruptions and offensive language.

Another segment focused on political ideologies, dissecting the hypocrisy of both liberals and conservatives, referencing Don Imus' firing, Media Matters for America, and the differing reactions to criticism of Christianity versus Islam.  The discussion included Colin (Colin Quinn), exploring media bias, political rhetoric, and the healthcare system in the United States, concluding with personal anecdotes and opinions on taxation and economic inequality, all delivered in an informal and highly profane manner.  The phone numbers for Colin Quinn's and Patrice O'Neal's comedy shows were provided.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  There's nothing I enjoy more than drunken teen girls.  There's a history of misogynistic behavior. 
[00:00:30]  The home of incest and anal sex.  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.  I am a fucking lunatic.  That's not shocking.  I love it!  What a freak show.  What a Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey freak show.  Best of our abilities.  We'll try really hard every day.  What are we going to do?  Best of our abilities or a good show?  This is what the show is.  Silly and stupid.  Whatever you want to call it, listen to it and like it or don't.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Looks like Sharon Osbourne's apology is making news on the BBC, Anthony. 
[00:01:00]  Wobble jizzle.  You are mentioned by name.  Oh, yeah?  We were just discussing that.  That's the first instant feedback I just looked at for today.  But Sharon Osbourne apologized for her remarks about Susan Boyle that she made on this fine comedy show.  Yes.  It said that it came down to the fact that she had to apologize. 
[00:01:30]  But she had to.  Why?  Well, she's in that world.  If you don't apologize, you know, they could destroy you.  I guarantee Sharon Osbourne doesn't mean her apology.  Just like everyone else's apologies that come before her.  She's a loose cannon, that one, though.  She comes across as, you know, her own gal.  Wow.  Yeah.  I don't think she had to or should have.  We made all the papers in New York, but not our names.  Not the Sharon Osbourne apology.  I don't like that.  But the BBC has our name all over the place. 
[00:02:00]  And all the other newspapers around America have our name all over the place.  But the New York papers, our hometown.  Yeah, they don't like it.  Fucking scumbags.  Go fuck yourself.  The only thing they won't mention is this show's name and the name of any black professor who punches a white lady in the face.  Yeah, there you go.  I would love the listeners to really contact the post of the Daily News and ask them.  I would love answers.  Yeah.  Why are you not talking about this?  Where's that story?  Steve Phillips is on the front page.  He fucks an ugly chick and he's on the front page of the paper. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Well, yeah, because she almost killed herself because of a Jay Leno line.  Jay Leno's line.  I don't want to, like, fuck it up, but basically.  It's a good one.  I understand you don't want to have steak every day, but.  But come on.  But come on.  And Steve Phillips is broad there.  The one he was kind of seeing on the side.  Got really depressed over the Jay Leno line.  That's when she lost it.  Really depressed.  That's when she lost it.  She's a fucking pig. 
[00:03:00]  Why are we fucking not, why are we sugarcoating everything in this country?  Well, she did.  Steve Phillips was banging some just slob of a woman.  Yeah.  She did some kind of interview.  I guess it was a, was it Today Show or one of those morning shows?  Yeah.  And she did an interview.  She was, like, crying.  Did you see the video?  No, I saw a clip, like a still pic.  Okay.  From it.  And she's, she's weepy.  Yeah.  She's pretty weepy.  Of course she is.  She didn't look like the most stable person in today.  No, no, no.  So, hey, good luck to you. 
[00:03:30]  Does she look as ugly talking as she does in pictures?  Um, I didn't see her talking.  I just saw a still picture from the video.  I don't even, I don't even think she's ugly.  She's just, like, frumpy.  She's frumpy.  She's just, uh, uh, what's another word?  Dumpy.  Frumpy's perfect.  Dumpy and frumpy's perfect.  She's one of those girls that you pass by on the street every day and just don't even  look at, because they're ugly or pretty.  No, just frumpy.  You don't look at frumps. 
[00:04:00]  You look at ugly people.  You look at really hot girls.  I've looked at more, like, fat asses on the street than I think I have hot asses.  I've just looked at that going, that is an amazingly fat ass with the big shelf on top  and the fucking ass within the ass, the center of the ass mass ass.  Oh, Serena Williams.  Well, they got the, uh, no, no, no, no.  I'm talking fat ass, not muscle ass.  You go, yeah, yeah, you're fucking behind somebody in the supermarket.  No, I understand. 
[00:04:30]  The ass literally moves differently than the rest of the body.  It's giant.  I'm just staring going, that defies all logic.  Yeah.  She's, uh, homely.  There you go.  Homely.  Homely.  She's a wallflower.  And she wasn't born with a nice, like, name.  What are some of those names that girls are born with where you know they just have to  be hot?  Don't go with the stripper names, though.  Tiffany.  Amber.  Amber.  Mercedes.  Man, if you're, if...  Riley. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, that's Travis.  She's Chris Griffin with brunette hair.  Jesus, coke logic.  No, but, I mean, if you're an ugly couple and you're having a kid, you can't, you can't  name your kid, like, Ashley.  Yeah.  Brittany.  I don't know how it works out that a lot of hot girls have, like, appropriately hot names.  I don't know.  It's, it's...  Like, how do they know right out of the shoot that they're going to be good looking or not?  That's a real good question. 
[00:05:30]  I don't know.  Some ugly babies turn out, you know, to be hot chicks and, uh, vicey-versy.  That's Steve Phillips' girl.  Uh, I got the audio, by the way.  We're going to play it right now.  Nice.  Uh, her name's Brooke Hunley.  Yeah.  Hunley.  She's got a frumpy name, Hunley.  That last name.  Yeah.  Yes.  All right.  She couldn't help the last name.  They try to, like, uh, jazz it up a little bit with Brooke.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, they try to spice it up a bit with the first name Brooke, but Hunley gives it  away.  That's a frump. 
[00:06:00]  You want to see what she said on Good Morning America?  Please.  All right.  You've been compared to the character in Fatal Attraction.  You've been called obsessed, vindictive.  Frumpy.  I'm sure you've heard some of this.  Hunley.  What do you say to that?  Ugly.  I think people are so quick to make a judgment.  It's almost like, here's a great story, here's a great chance for me to destroy a person  without any sense of really thinking about the fact that there's a human being behind 
[00:06:30]  those words.  Boo.  I almost can't take it anymore.  I almost, I would really like an option to live somewhere else.  And I mean, yeah, sure.  Sorry.  And I mean not on this planet.  I can't take it anymore.  It's all the same.  Did you hear what Brooke Hunley just said?  Yes.  Do you know what she did to Steve Phillips' wife?  What is she talking about?  Yeah, yeah.  And I guarantee this GMA bitch, we're going to be harsh today.  Let's just be really harsh. 
[00:07:00]  This GMA bitch.  As opposed to what?  Yeah.  As opposed to good?  As opposed to nice?  I'm willing to bet money that this GMA bitch doesn't even challenge her on that last statement  about, well, that's kind of what you did to Steve Phillips' wife.  I'm even going to back up.  Listen.  Listen again.  This is exactly what she did to Steve's wife.  Any sense of really thinking about the fact that there's a human being behind those words?  I've been called things by the public that no woman should ever be called. 
[00:07:30]  Saying what?  I've been called the C word.  I've been called.  I've been called.  I've been called.  I've been called.  I've been called.  I've been called.  I've been called.  I've been called.  I've been called.  I've been called.  I've been called.  Chubby.  Cake eater.  Cock wilter.  You're going to get no sympathy here, you frump.  Fucking go away.  Oh, Zach's classic.  And it goes, what?  Puck?  I hope that people heard it out there.  The C word. 
[00:08:00]  I've been called.  Stop whining.  I've been called.  Stop it.  Oh, yeah.  No woman should ever be called.  Saying what?  I've been called the C word.  I've been called a whore.  I've been called a homewrecker.  Was there a moment?  Well, let me think about that.  Homewrecker?  Is she a homewrecker?  Let's see if I'm walking through it, she is.  A little fat, fat fucking troll.  Bull-bodied monster.  Fire plug.  Exactly.  Tasmanian hussy. 
[00:08:30]  On Lee.  Let's think about this.  Is she a homewrecker?  I think she's all those things she just mentioned.  Yes, she is.  Yeah.  She's a cunt because she sent that letter to the wife.  That's a very cunty thing to do.  Absolutely.  A whore?  Yeah.  Well, sure.  She's fucking around.  She's fucking a married man.  A married man.  Some guy that's...  That's whorish, right?  ...is known to have whored around himself.  He's a whore.  She's a whore.  So it's whorish.  What was the other one? 
[00:09:00]  A homewrecker.  A homewrecker.  Well, I guess they...  It wasn't up to her to drop notes on the stoop.  Yeah.  For the wife to read.  Exactly.  And then spin off in her car.  Yeah.  And hit the fucking...  She couldn't even get away.  Right.  She hit the fucking fence or some shit.  Frump.  The C-word.  I've been called a whore.  I've been called a homewrecker.  Was there a moment in all this that you felt like, my life is forever changed? 
[00:09:30]  I can never go back.  When not only were tablets covering it, but legitimate news was covering it.  When Jay Leno was using my looks as part of his opening monologue as a...  To get a cheap laugh.  A cheap laugh.  There's Steve.  Okay.  There's his wife.  There's the mistress.  Put them together.  What was he thinking?  I realize you can't have steak every day, but please.  At that point, you know, a person has their breaking point. 
[00:10:00]  That was my breaking point.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Fucking Leno rules.  Greatest S.  Wow.  Fucking Leno rules.  And the audience reaction was just like, yeah.  When they put your picture up and people go, ah.  I'm so happy she's being publicly humiliated.  I wish nothing but the absolute worst for this fucking girl. 
[00:10:30]  Because of the way she went and did this guy's wife and I guess allegedly contacted her.  She has jowls.  Oh my gosh.  She has jowls.  She's even worse when you clean her up.  Right?  Yeah.  She's, you know.  She's just frumpy.  Sometimes, you know, it's just...  You really can't.  Sometimes if you have a dirty car, just keep it dirty.  Yeah.  Why bother?  What's the point?  Carnauba.  She should only stand next to fatter things.  Why are you standing next to that milk truck? 
[00:11:00]  Oh, I don't know.  It thins me.  It looks thinner.  Yes.  And yeah, let's not forget.  Thank you, Spectro.  Because I forgot.  She also befriended Phillips' kid on Facebook.  Let's not forget that.  Yeah.  Pulled all those shenanigans.  She deserves everything that he's being thrown at her.  She needs a picture next to, I don't know, like Susan Boyle.  Oof.  And then you could be like, oh, wow.  Right.  You know.  Who would you rather fuck, you know?  What was Steve Phillips thinking?  This chick must have fucking did something that he wanted. 
[00:11:30]  Yes.  There had to have been something.  Because he wasn't looking at that ass of hers going, wow, I got to get some of that ass.  And she doesn't sound like a thrilling fucking storyteller or interesting little let's just hang out kind of a chick.  I wanted to, I'm trying to think how I could say this.  I think she just did some nasty things.  Yeah?  That it didn't matter.  Hiney, coolie sex?  Did she like sex in the coolie, do you think? 
[00:12:00]  I'm thinking.  Oh, he's writing.  Oh, he's getting the, oh.  So mysterious.  Oh, this has to be bad.  All right.  Oh, he's jotting something down here.  Let's see.  What would she do that would keep this guy who can get hot chicks but decided to be with the frumpy Hundley?  Well, this is the first, this is only part one.  Okay.  Part two is the big one.  Wow, this is the big one.  Let's see.  So she likes that. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  She likes that.  I don't think the wife's doing that.  Hiney, Hiney hole sex.  Okay.  But then I write the word while.  Oh, okay.  Let's see.  While.  Actually, I had a girl that wanted to do this once and I just, I just couldn't bring myself,  I couldn't bring myself to do this, to be honest with you.  No, you did not.  So this is the full thing that I think Steve's into that she gave up. 
[00:13:00]  Really?  Why not, man?  Because she's, I mean.  That's pretty Steve.  No, but you didn't do what I'm saying, really?  You could have done that.  You didn't?  Yeah, well, yeah.  That's so degrading.  Yeah, exactly.  That it's like, is there, I don't know, I don't get any pleasure in the degradation of  the girl you're with, like having sex like that.  Well, what we're talking about is the beautiful possibility of, like, I'll just say for myself, 
[00:13:30]  I would love to fuck a girl in the ass while her head's in the toilet.  While her head is in the toilet.  I would love that.  Like she sticks her in the toilet.  Not right after I got through with a fucking dump.  I think the echo of her moaning would sound kind of cool in a toilet.  That fucking, whoa.  Disembodied echo.  But, yeah, that's kind of, hmm.  Let's continue with the audio.  I had a friend who had to come stay with me because he was concerned.  That you might do something to yourself. 
[00:14:00]  That mentally, I would not be able to take much more.  Brooke Hundley calls herself a good girl who worked hard and never wanted to be involved  with a married man.  The perception is that this was a consensual relationship, that it was a loving affair.  Legally, I've been advised not to speak about anything regarding him.  Phillips told police they had three sexual encounters.  But in August, Hundley filed an application for a restraining order against Phillips, 
[00:14:30]  which she later withdrew, saying he pursued her and, quote, threatened me,  stating that if I spoke a word of this to his wife, that he would ruin more than just my reputation,  but could easily get me fired.  Why do we have to be the smart ones in media?  You know what that's about?  Yeah.  He was done with her.  She said, whoa, no, no, no.  And then he threatened her.  He said, look, I'll make your life a living hell.  Whoa, Nelly. 
[00:15:00]  So then she got scared and got the restraining order.  But he probably tried to walk away from this.  Yeah.  In my opinion.  You're right.  GMA, where was the question of she saying, there's a person under there.  Why weren't you thinking that when you were asked on this guy's wife or a fucking kid?  Yeah, that there's people under there.  Me fired.  On camera, Hundley would only say this.  I was in a situation where I felt like if I didn't do what was asked of me, then everything 
[00:15:30]  I had worked for for the past six years, everything I had done to establish myself as a successful  media professional could be gone like that.  Wasn't she getting coffee?  Yeah.  How did you establish yourself as a media professional by fucking one of the guys on  the show?  Right, right.  I should have thought of that before you went down that road.  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, that's not the thing you do if you want to, you know, work your way 
[00:16:00]  up.  Within a company.  With dignity, I mean.  Sure.  You can do it, but then call yourself what you are.  If you felt harassed, though, in any way, couldn't you have taken it higher?  Couldn't you have gone to HR or someone?  When you go to people who you feel like are close to you and that you can trust, and they're  quick to just shut you down, to tell you that, you know, nobody wants to hear about it, then  you don't really have the confidence to want to go above them. 
[00:16:30]  You almost feel a sense of defeat that, what's the point?  Hundley was ultimately fired from ESPN after the case became public.  In a statement, ESPN told ABC News, our investigation determined that Hundley's characterization of  the events was inconsistent.  ESPN also says it has a clear and consistent policy against harassment in the workplace.  We investigate all charges and take appropriate action.  I obviously feel pain for anybody else that I may have brought into this situation, but 
[00:17:00]  I did things and I thought about things just as an avenue to get people to pay attention.  Shut up.  You must understand, though, what it looks like, I mean, for any wife, for any mom, to pick  up a letter and read about their own children.  I can imagine getting a letter like that and being scared.  It's the same fear that I felt for months before. 
[00:17:30]  So if people think you're a stalker, are they wrong?  Absolutely.  Wow.  How fucking hateable is she?  She's delusional, first of all.  Yeah, maybe she's just mentally ill.  She's delusional.  Dude, I have, like, no mercy for people who are mentally ill, which is kind of, I guess,  I think it's fucked up on my part.  If she was hot, I would be like, aww.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  I'm trying to contact her.  Like, it would be like, oh, this poor girl, this fucking guy was an asshole to her. 
[00:18:00]  Like, let's make believe she's hot for a few minutes.  Aw.  Aw, man.  You know something?  She sent the letter.  She felt hurt.  And she sent the letter to the guy, this scumbag that fucked up her whole life now, was having  sex with her.  And this poor girl decided, you know, she's going to get a little vengeful.  You know what I say?  Good for her.  Good for her.  He should have made promises he wasn't going to keep her.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And you know he came on to her.  Yeah.  She's all hot walking around the office and probably getting harassed every day from her 
[00:18:30]  hotness.  And this fucking scumbag takes advantage of a poor, impressionable girl.  And look at what happens.  Fucking let him have to take a cheap shot at the poor girl.  You know something?  You should resign from one, though, Jimmy.  Oh, I don't want anything to do with that.  That's just not in good taste.  You know, she's probably got other things than just her beauty.  Why did Leno just concentrate on her hotness and her beauty?  Yeah.  And not just talk about the person inside.  And insult the guy's wife by going, what are you thinking? 
[00:19:00]  What a pig that wife is compared to this hot.  That's exactly what would be happening to her.  Who's kidding?  Who here knows?  I would be fucking Charlie changed attitude.  She was attractive.  All right.  Let's get to the last clip.  This is the clip about the wife.  I didn't in any time working at ESPN follow anybody around, wanting any sort of relationship  with anybody.  I didn't harass anyone. 
[00:19:30]  Is there something that you would want to say now to Marnie Phillips?  The same fear that I heard in her, and I listened to that 911 call after the fact, the same  fear I heard in her voice was similar fear to how I had felt.  See, she can't get away with just saying, look, she was afraid.  I sent this letter to the wife.  I'm sorry I brought her into it.  The situation had me not thinking clearly when I did that. 
[00:20:00]  But she's got to justify it.  She can't even take responsibility.  She can't own it.  She's got to say, I felt the same fear, which means, yeah, the lawsuit.  She's just trying to protect herself.  Well, let's remember what was in that letter, you know, he doesn't love you anymore.  He loves me.  He hasn't loved you in a long, long time.  Oh, you know, Hundley, stupid Hundley was similar fear to how I had felt, and I would  never have wanted anybody else to feel or to go through what I was going through. 
[00:20:30]  You brought that on.  Uh-huh.  I brought it on, but not intentionally.  Why?  I simply wanted somebody to get upset enough to have an impact to get me out of this horrific  situation.  Steve Phillips told police it was his pulling back from the relationship that made Hundley  become erratic and delusional.  But Hundley says she was never in love with anyone at ESPN. 
[00:21:00]  If Steve Phillips were watching, is there anything you would want to say to him?  You know, anything between me and Steve has been resolved.  I take responsibility for my own actions, and I would hope that some, at some point,  that he would grow up and take responsibility for his own actions as well.  I mean, he's got an issue, too, man.  She's fucked up.  You've got to realize that she might have some issues there. 
[00:21:30]  Wow.  She's hateable.  And she's still hung up on this guy.  You can tell by that last statement.  Of course.  She's still, like, hung up on this guy.  She's hoping that he'll call.  Yep.  Someday.  He needs to mature so he can then approach her, and they can have an adult, civil conversation  about the situation.  He wanted to just shove his dick in you.  That's what he was doing.  You were an easy target.  Stop it, of course.  For God, I was looking for some strange.  With a Star Wars blaster.  Not once did she say how repulsive she was for contacting his wife and kid. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That, by the way, is my favorite photo.  It is my favorite Hunley picture.  No, that's my favorite photo of, including me and Sabbath, this is my favorite photo.  It's the Hunley with a Stormtrooper and Darth Vader picture at MGM or something.  Fuck it.  Or ABC.  Look at that frump.  What a mess.  Let's go to Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris.  His legs.  Hey, Chris.  Last year, a little shirt.  What's up, buddy?  Holy shit.  I have never seen a better set up for a lawsuit on TV in my life. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  This bitch has got this rehearsed, man.  You can't tell me she don't know what she's saying.  She teed that up nicely.  She's all ready to fucking smack it.  And the reporter just sucks.  Yep.  Not calling her out and stuff.  You got to, like, go, wow, you seem a little crazy.  You seem a little unstable.  You all right, Brooke?  Oh, my God.  Hey, be good, boy.  Thanks for your honesty.  All right, Chris.  Let's go to Sharon Osbourne.  Sharon Osbourne.  Hi, Sharon.  Hello, boy.  What's up, Sharon? 
[00:23:00]  It looks like she goes in with a frumpy stick.  A frumpy stick?  I'm sorry.  Sharon calls every day now.  I love it.  You sound like she had a cold.  Oh, cool.  Let's go to Dave in Ontario.  Dave.  Good morning, boys.  How are you?  Pretty good, Dave.  Good.  Yeah, I actually investigate this stuff.  I'm a police officer.  She's actually showing some signs of where certain stalkers will make efforts in order for the person they're stalking to have to come and see them again. 
[00:23:30]  Because they know that they're not going to get to see them again.  So what they'll do is they'll do a restraining order.  They'll do shit like that just in order to be able to see them again.  She believes that this guy actually loves her, and she's trying to make efforts in order for this guy to come back.  Wow.  So maybe then when Steve sees her, he realizes the connection they have. 
[00:24:00]  Exactly.  Now, the classic case was Madonna stalker.  When she refused to go to court.  She did not want to go to court.  She'd never actually seen her stalker.  But stalker did it and went to court, and he kind of won because, oh, look, at the end of the day, I'm in the same courtroom.  Right, exactly.  So that's actually a pretty good sign of mental illness on her part.  Cool.  What's going on?  I'll have to show you.  Yeah, we've got to show you. 
[00:24:30]  There's some covert stuff going on.  It's pretty fucking funny.  All right, thank you, Dave.  Let's go to David in Kansas City.  Hey, David.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Kansas City.  Wasn't the Hunley a Civil War battleship or a submarine or something like that?  I think it was like one of those first ironclad ships they ever made.  It was the Hunley.  The Hunley.  Oh, wait.  I think it might have been a submarine.  Really?  Look that up.  North Carolina.  It was under the ground or under the beach, and they dug it out.  It might have been a submarine. 
[00:25:00]  The USS Hunley?  I think it was a submarine when they should have been building submarines, like in the  1800s or something.  Like, what the fuck are they building submarines already?  Oh, was it that one?  Yeah, with the big poker.  Yeah, the H.L. Hunley.  It had a big stick on the end, and you put the explosives on the end of the big stick,  and you drive it into a ship, and hopefully the explosives were far enough away from your  ship.  Oh, my God.  What a risk that was.  Yeah, and then there's another one with a harpoon and explosives, and you'd stick it 
[00:25:30]  into the ship and then try to back away.  But apparently it took on water and sunk and killed all men aboard.  It didn't work?  The technology didn't work too well?  I think they just recently raised it, and yeah, it's going to be in a museum.  Oh, that's a good call then, man.  The Hunley.  Let me say hi to Max in Fairfield.  Max.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, man.  I was just wondering how Scottish Anthony would have handled this situation.  Buzz saying she's a fat peg and a coont and a har. 
[00:26:00]  You're a fucking har.  You're a fucking har.  She likes sukin' a cook.  She's a hooligan.  Hooligan.  Fucking Kevin from Connecticut saying she looks just like Rachel Dratch from SNL.  Well, yeah.  All that.  Yeah, yeah.  I can see that.  And a lot of, she looks like E-Rock coming in.  Oh, boy.  Poor E-Rock. 
[00:26:30]  Poor E-Rock.  Not poor her.  Yeah, poor E-Rock.  She looks like E-Rock, and we're sympathetic to E-Rock.  Poor E-Rock.  Can we get Sam in here?  I want to do the Carrie thing from Larry King before we move on to today's new material.  Because this thing is great.  Oh, let me run it down the hall.  Hold on.  Look at his feet.  And this audio has legs.  And we had it yesterday, but we just never got to because we were so busy.  So we should play it today.  I watched it last night.  Holy shit.  I don't know how to say her last name.  Prejean.  Prejean.  Prejean.  Cont.  Cont by accurate.  Prejean. 
[00:27:00]  Prejean.  Prejean.  Prejean.  What's the back story on Carrie Prejean?  Well, she was in the pageant Miss USA, Miss America, whatever it was.  Yeah.  And I believe she was the one who Perez Hilton asked how she felt on gay marriage.  She answered honestly and said she wasn't, she didn't like it.  It wasn't her thing.  It wasn't her thing.  And then she was hung out to dry by Perez Hilton in America where you should have an opinion on things.  And then more recently, there were reports of a solo sex tape that she may have made for a boyfriend when she was 17. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, and where is this available?  I do not believe it's available because she's underage.  Yes.  And, you know, you could have sex at 17, but you cannot take pictures at 17.  Isn't that amazing?  And, yes, and you cannot show someone that's 17 any type of nudity or pornography photograph.  But, again, you could be nude in front of them and have sex in front of them. 
[00:28:00]  How do you know all this?  And have sex.  How do you know all this?  How do you know all this?  In a few states.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  He just rattles that off like he's done some research.  It's really, really strange.  Don't want to get in touch.  I hear you.  Sit down.  Have some iced tea and cookies.  Nope.  Yeah, the Hunley was a wooden sub.  It's here in a warehouse that was supposed to be turned into a museum.  That's Brandon in South Carolina. 
[00:28:30]  South Carolina.  The Hunley's just in a fucking warehouse, Brandon.  Yeah, it's in just a warehouse off the river.  It was brought up.  It's all wooden.  Piece of shit.  It was supposed to be in a museum and they ran out of money.  It was a confederate ship, right?  Yeah.  A confederate sub?  Yeah.  Anything that has to do with the confederacy now is just so taboo.  Why?  Because it's looked at as.  It's history, though.  But there are some people that would rather just kind of brush that under the carpet, 
[00:29:00]  like the old Southern Cross, the flag.  But wouldn't you want to see that stuff as part of history?  You would.  There were the daughters of the confederacy.  That organization takes a lot of shit.  And having a confederate flag within your state flag, that's been taking a lot of crap over the years.  And confederate museums and stuff just don't get the financing that other museums get  because people feel it's so offensive that people are fighting to keep slaves, 
[00:29:30]  which they weren't fighting.  That wasn't what the Civil War was about.  It's part of history.  Yeah, yeah.  They'd rather erase history or revise history than just kind of let it out there.  Oh, well.  All right.  What are you going to do?  Thank you, Brandon.  I appreciate that.  We've got Andy Rooney checking in.  Let's get right to Andy.  Andy.  You ever notice that women who get fired for sexual misconduct always want to file a lawsuit? 
[00:30:00]  I kind of like this, Andy.  All right.  So what do we got on her?  So then supposedly there might be a sex tape of her pleasuring herself.  Right.  And so she's got all these court cases.  I think at one point she sued the pageant and then they settled.  And there's a court case about the sex tape.  So Larry King had her on the show.  Right.  I'm sure he asked just some hard-hitting questions.  Because she wrote a book.  Yeah.  And she's promoting the book.  But she wouldn't answer any questions about anything that anybody cares about because she said everything. 
[00:30:30]  She just credited everything to being in litigation.  So she couldn't talk about that.  She couldn't talk about this.  And Larry King ended up getting really annoyed at her.  Well, he didn't start off being...  He started off with a reasonable question.  He's like, I'm not asking you what you settled for.  I think he probably was told she won't talk about the settlement.  So he must have known that beforehand.  Did we get the old Larry King?  Because Larry used to be a really good interviewer.  Well, he wasn't...  It's hard to say because the question he asked...  Yeah.  It was probably one that anybody would have asked. 
[00:31:00]  He said, what...  Do you like stew?  That was actually it.  But she couldn't talk about it.  And she's in litigation with Dintymore.  Because she alleged that what's in her underpants looks like Dintymore stew.  He asked her, what motivated you to settle?  I said, I can't talk about that.  Let's listen to this shit.  All right.  And so it got a little ugly, too, there, huh?  Yes, it was very awkward.  How hateable is she in this?  I was totally loving Larry King.  She came off as hateable.  She is just shit.  Yes.  All right.  Let's get to an embarrassing part for you and how you handle it. 
[00:31:30]  You recently confirmed that when you were 17, you made what you call a private video,  a sexual type tape that you sent to your boyfriend.  Have you seen the video?  You know, I don't think that's the important issue, Larry.  I think that, you know, there's a video out there of me that I sent to my boyfriend at the time.  And it was for private use.  But does that justify my actions?  No.  And I take complete responsibility for the decisions that I made when I was a teenager. 
[00:32:00]  But I think that the biggest thing is that you own up to it, you take responsibility, and you just move forward.  Did you own up to it?  Did you let the Miss California or the Miss USA pageant know about that video?  You know, I think that people need to be reminded that I was not fired for any video, for any photos.  I was fired for, I guess, supposed contract violations, not making appearances, and I guess being hard to work with.  Nervous titter. 
[00:32:30]  Did she not seem like an absolute cunt?  Because she wouldn't answer the question.  It's like, did you see it or not?  Right.  Don't tell them what's appropriate.  You were doing an interview.  Answer the question.  And then she wouldn't answer whether she showed the pageant people or not.  No.  So there's two questions asked and zero answers.  Yeah, she stinks this bitch.  Yeah, let's keep track of how many questions she doesn't answer.  The question was, did you inform them?  Because they have a morals clause in their contract.  Right, but I was not fired for.  I mean, did you ever tell them about the tape?  I was not fired for a morals clause, Larry. 
[00:33:00]  If you look back, you will see that they fired me solely for contract violations for missing appearances.  So this has absolutely nothing to do with why I was fired.  But people would like to accuse me of that.  Wow, she didn't answer.  That is, any fucking interrogator will tell you that is a sure sign that someone's fucking, like, being deceptive.  Or just not, or uncomfortable and doesn't want to go any further.  Yeah, exactly.  Three questions, none answered, by the way. 
[00:33:30]  Would you like to play poker against her, Ant?  Oh, yeah.  All right, she's, wow, she's raising.  All right, I called.  Dummy.  What a dolt.  All right.  Fuck her and her shitter.  One other thing, by the way, do you plan any legal action to block the video from being made public?  Because you were underage when it was made.  You know, everything that was discussed, Larry, in mediation is completely confidential. 
[00:34:00]  And it seems as though I'm the only one holding up to that contract.  So, if that's the case, then I will stand by that contract and abide by it.  Answer me.  Did you get a settlement, though?  That's completely confidential.  There was a confidential mediation, and I don't think that needs to be discussed right now.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  We'll be right back.  That have been answered immediately.  Wow, Larry sounds very annoyed.  What's the use of having her there?  She hasn't answered one question. 
[00:34:30]  What are you doing an interview for?  She wrote a book about herself.  Gives a fuck about her life.  Gives a flying fuck.  But she won't talk about anything interesting about herself.  Please tell me this ends with Larry just going, get out.  Please go get out.  Leave.  Leave right now.  Leave.  Leave.  Live.  Live.  Live.  You sued the pageant after they fired you.  They countersued.  And then you accused them of a number of things, including religious discrimination.  Clearly an issue very important to you. 
[00:35:00]  Why did you settle?  You don't have to tell me the terms of the settlement, but why settled?  You had a fight to carry on.  Larry, everything that was discussed in mediation, I'll say it again, is completely confidential.  It doesn't matter.  I'm not going to be able to talk about that.  So I'm just letting you know that ahead of time.  You can't even say why you settled?  Yeah.  That's not, how does that break what you settled for?  I'm not asking you what the settlement was.  The confidential agreement.  I'm asking you why did you agree to settle?  It's a confidential agreement and I am not allowed to talk about that. 
[00:35:30]  No, you can, you dumb fuck.  What motivated you?  So the agreement discusses the motive behind why each party agreed?  Larry, you're being inappropriate.  You really are.  So I'm not going to talk about it.  I'm asking a question.  God bless Larry.  I'm asking a question, you cunt.  His face was great.  He goes, what?  He says it's confused.  She's an idiot because he's asking her what her mental, like in her mind, why did she settle? 
[00:36:00]  If it's such an important issue to her, why not play it out in court and instead of settling, get your point out there and whatever.  You don't have to tell what the settlement is or anything and then just say, well, I believed that I would have been in litigation for a long time or something.  Just anything.  She can talk about that.  She can say, look, I just wanted it to be over.  Yeah, yeah.  But then again, the motivation might have been my case was not that strong and they threw a lot of money at me. 
[00:36:30]  Exactly.  I don't know.  That's not the great motivation.  Let's go to Larry King, an exclusive for our show.  Larry.  Mr. Kumiya.  Yes.  Hello.  Good.  How deep into your rectum did you settle for the dildo?  Gee, I don't think there's any dildo in our rectum video.  Larry.  I don't know what that video is.  We got the real Larry King right here.  Larry.  Yes, when you made the sex tape, how did you get the real developed? 
[00:37:00]  The real.  Or is this the real Larry King?  I'm not sure now.  Larry.  When you made the sex tape, what did you do with the groceries?  That's the real Larry.  Okay.  We figured it out.  She is pretty.  You are the real Larry.  She is hot.  Wow.  You know something?  I'm kind of thinking I'm seeing her side a little more now.  I'm kind of seeing her side.  Larry's being inappropriate.  I'm hot when she fucking turns her head, though.  Larry's being inappropriate. 
[00:37:30]  You didn't really think so?  She is fucking, I really hope she just falls, face starts on a lawnmower.  She stinks.  Yeah, let's continue with this.  You really are.  So, I'm not going to talk about.  I'm asking a question.  I'm not going to talk about anything that was discussed in mediation.  It's completely confidential.  And it was a confidential settlement.  All I'm asking.  So, what you're saying is, in mediation, it was discussed, why you were mediating?  Larry, it's completely confidential.  And you're being inappropriate.  Okay. 
[00:38:00]  Okay?  All right.  So, you're being inappropriate.  Appropriate King Live continues.  God bless you, Larry.  Wow, Larry actually has some wins.  Okay, Larry woke up.  But you're right.  He should have thrown her out.  He should have said, you know what?  Nobody wants to hear about what it's like to be pretty.  Get off my show.  You know how much people would have loved Larry if he said, get off my show?  Yeah.  I don't know why they have to follow some kind of ethics or something.  Why can't Larry just go, why are you here then?  Then why are you here?  Or at least say that.  Why are you here? 
[00:38:30]  You do know I'm Larry King and I do interviews, don't you?  You realize the world is watching me right now.  Why are you here?  What do you want to talk about then?  Right.  Go ahead.  Anything like that would have been classic.  Yeah.  I don't know how this ends because I didn't see it.  So, I'm hoping there's a good ending.  What was she there to talk about?  Her book.  What book?  What's in her book?  Like, maybe growing up and being in the pageant world.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Who cares?  We don't know.  Boring.  Jesus. 
[00:39:00]  I just started yelling at Sam.  Shut up, Sam.  Like Sam's writing about his pageant life.  Yes.  When he was a fucking twink in fucking chicken hawk videos.  How important are the answers to an interview?  That's Larry King checking in from L.A.  Two-sided conversation.  How important.  Right.  I'd rather interview a chunk of garlic sitting in the chair.  How important is give and take?  Larry takes a phone call.  Carrie takes off her mic. 
[00:39:30]  Correct.  Nice.  Detroit.  Hello.  Hi.  I'm calling from Detroit.  Yes.  I'm a gay man and I love pageants.  I'm sure that you, Carrie, have got, you know, great gay friends that helped you possibly win.  What would you give them as advice if they wanted to get married?  Did you hear the question, Carrie?  What?  What?  Is she eating chips?  That's her tearing her microphone off?  Correct.  What was wrong with that question? 
[00:40:00]  Well...  This...  I hate this.  I think she had made the decision before the question was actually heard that she was done.  Whatever fucking pukey publicist or handler she had.  We find out later, she had another rule.  She couldn't talk about anything in litigation.  Oh, it was one of those rule interviews?  And she didn't want to take phone calls.  But Larry King is known for going to the...  Like, that's his thing is like, you're on the air.  Larry realized that he couldn't get any questions out, so he went to a phone to try to salvage something, but... 
[00:40:30]  Of course.  She also would not take phone calls.  Oh, it's classic.  We got Sharon Osbourne checking in.  Sharon!  Good morning, boy.  Hi, Sharon.  This dear, bless her heart, was blessed with the ability to take it elbow deep and peen with the annoying stick.  An annoying stick.  Sharon?  Sharon?  Oh, no, she's...  She didn't apologize, though.  Oh, yeah, you gotta apologize.  Wow, you gotta apologize.  Sharon Osbourne's calling.  Make sure you had your call with the apology. 
[00:41:00]  So far, Sharon Osbourne has called with the frumpy stick and the annoying stick today.  Anthony, you're not going to believe this.  Oh, yeah.  Larry King on line three.  Larry!  No way.  Good morning.  Good morning, Larry.  I'm wondering, how will the next sex tape be a talkie?  A talkie?  That they ever even called him that is funny.  A talkie.  I remember before talkies.  I want to say it every day, so I will say it right now. 
[00:41:30]  Funniest listeners in radio.  That statement will be said every day.  Here we go.  Let's get back to her eating chips or taking her mic off.  I can't tell.  Did you hear the question, Carrie?  Did she hear the question?  Is she leaving?  Was I asked what motivated the settlement?  Excuse me?  Oh.  I couldn't hear the question.  Did you hear the question?  No, I can't hear you. 
[00:42:00]  You took the mic off.  If you put the mic on, we can hear you.  Yeah, I think that you are being extremely inappropriate right now, and I'm about to leave your show.  Well, so I went to another area.  I took a phone call.  They asked a question of you.  I left that subject.  You feel it was inappropriate?  I didn't mean to be inappropriate.  I just thought it was a logical question.  But you need to have a mic.  Who are you talking to?  How much part is the microphone? 
[00:42:30]  Wait.  Who is she talking to?  Probably someone.  Publicist.  Shit.  Publicist or lawyer.  Hello?  Hello?  We'll be back right after the Venus Messages on Larry King Live.  This is great stuff, man.  Best Larry King ever.  This is great.  The world is watching.  The CNN is everywhere.  Everywhere.  And the whole time, it was just like a long shot of the room that Carrie was in.  And she was just talking to someone off camera. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  And Larry King's just going, who are you talking to?  Hello?  Who are you talking to?  Put the microphone on.  This TV show is just crumbling around.  What happened when they came back?  I got that clip.  Oh, okay.  I didn't see that.  We got one more clip to go.  Larry's got something to say, I bet.  God, can you imagine?  I mean, I have this desire to be a little more mainstream at times.  But if this broad is on our show and pulls this shit.  Oh, C-bomb.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine how we would handle that?  She's getting poker chips thrown out of linger rape. 
[00:43:30]  Is there anything in your soul that would hold you back?  I'm amazed even a Larry King could hold back at that point.  Yes.  And still try to keep it above the table and professional.  I'm amazed by that.  He was still coddling her.  He probably had nothing else to do on his show.  He was being sarcastic to her.  You think?  Yes.  You could definitely tell.  He was like, well, put the mic on.  I can't hear you.  Who are you talking to? 
[00:44:00]  Like, it wasn't, that wasn't the doddering old man, Larry King.  That was the, hey, it's my fucking show.  I wasn't doing anything inappropriately.  I went to a phone call to change the subject and you left.  But this was the last segment of the show.  Yeah.  So he didn't have, like, he couldn't extend another guest stay.  Like, if she left the show.  He had nothing.  He's got to fill ten minutes.  I got nothing.  You could just go to the callers and banter.  I would just bash her for the rest of the fucking show.  Why not?  You're not going to believe this.  Oh, what?  Larry King's choice.  That's great.  Larry! 
[00:44:30]  I know he's a listener.  Wow.  Larry King.  Larry?  Yeah.  What's up, Larry?  Jesus.  What we learned here tonight was that at 17, you were taking pictures of things shoving  your cunt, and now tonight you're being a cunt.  Oh, my God, Larry.  That, Larry.  He's crazy.  He's quite the card.  He sure is.  He loves throwing a C-bomb around every once in a while.  Here's the final Larry King clip. 
[00:45:00]  We're back with Carrie Prejean.  I did not certainly mean to ask you a question.  You don't want to take phone calls, right?  Yeah, that was the agreement that you had with my publicist.  No one told me.  I didn't know.  I didn't know we weren't supposed to take phone calls.  And I meant nothing with the question.  I was just asking motive.  Right, and this is you and I talking.  Okay, all right.  I appreciate that.  Ugh!  Okay.  What are you going to do next?  Oh, my gosh.  I am just so excited to be promoting this book. 
[00:45:30]  I'm just so excited to be an author now.  You let us down, Larry.  It's really great that, you know, I'm 22 years old.  Oh, Larry.  I think that I have accomplished so much.  Larry, Larry, Larry.  What are you doing letting a plug a fucking book, Larry?  Larry.  He held the book up.  What are you letting a plug for?  What are you doing, Larry?  I can't talk about what I'm doing next.  I can't talk about anything.  What is wrong with him?  That fucking publicist.  He allowed some publicist to dictate what he does on Larry King?  What an asshole. 
[00:46:00]  Booter.  He came off as a weakling right there.  He should have coaxed her back like they did, back to the table, with the mic back on.  We're back with Larry King Live.  Hey, Carrie, get the fuck out of here.  I just wanted to bring you back to throw you off my show.  You're not walking off my show.  I'm throwing you off.  Get out.  Now, every phone caller, just bash her.  He apologized.  What a pussy.  What's your Twitter? 
[00:46:30]  We'll give it out to all the people, so they can bash you.  That was fun until that last clip.  Come on.  Larry.  What a fucking worm.  Larry.  You're pushing out, Larry.  You're going to find your courage dead in the hallway, Larry.  Your mother, Larry.  Oh, Larry.  Oh, what a fucking, what a, what a, what a cuckold.  She's a cunt.  Yeah, and he was an interview cuckold right there.  We're, we're part of a dumb media world.  I'm so excited.  I'm an author.  Shut your fucking face. 
[00:47:00]  Well, at that point, it gives a shit.  I'm so excited about promoting this book.  Are you?  Why?  Because you can't fucking talk about anything?  How exciting is that?  What's in it?  Obviously, you can't talk about anything.  How great would that have been if you slammed her?  Yeah, it's the only thing that made her newsworthy was that, that scandal.  Yes.  And there, she doesn't talk word one about it.  She has a book that no one gives a fuck about.  That might as well be more than the fucking catch.  Yeah.  More than the fucking nice ass.  More than the sweet tits and ass. 
[00:47:30]  Brian the Trigger.  Brian.  Brian.  Good morning.  Good morning, Brian.  Hey, uh, she's just being childish.  Uh, there's a point which takes her mic off.  And Larry's talking to her and she says, I can't hear you.  No, I can't hear you.  Well, how does she answer him if she can't hear him?  Yeah, because I think Larry's asked, yeah, can you hear me?  And she said, no, I can't.  No, I can't hear you.  And then he said something like, if you want to hear me, put the mic on.  And she put the mic on.  I think the headphones.  Yeah.  Right.  Thanks.  Oh, fucking publicist. 
[00:48:00]  Aren't they the worst?  The fucking worst.  Yeah.  We got in trouble because we kept a guest in here too long.  Yeah, Brooke Hogan, who was having a good time.  Publicist.  How does that make sense?  Just like, ugh.  Yeah.  The longer you stay in here, the more you get to promote your project.  How does that make sense?  Would you guys have been okay if Mary Weiland had come in here yesterday and said she couldn't  talk about Scott Weiland or doing drugs too?  Yeah, yeah.  That would be cool.  Okay, well, I would smear those chocolate candies right in her face.  Where Belladonna wouldn't talk about porn or allow dirty language. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, right, yeah.  Uh, you know the agreement we had beforehand, no talking about, uh, pornography?  Uh, we had that once with Tommy Lee.  The famous fucking phone call where he called us out and go, and he said, and that's what  enraged me that day?  He goes, you were told, he goes, you were told not to talk about that.  Exactly, that's what we want to talk about though, the herp, right?  No, no, no.  Wasn't it the herp?  No, no, it was Pam Anderson.  But the point is, no one told us not to talk about anything. 
[00:49:00]  No one.  And he called us out live saying, you were told.  Like, what the fuck are you talking about?  No one told us shit.  God.  Say pussy one more time, I'm hanging up, pussy.  Pussy, click.  Goodbye.  Later.  Go check your skimmer, dummy.  Yeah, really, really affected our careers, didn't it, Tommy?  Go backwash the fucking osh-gosh-pagosh out of your filter.  Uh, Maurice in Newark. 
[00:49:30]  A little harsh.  That's perfect.  It's perfect for today.  This is harsh Friday.  I'm calling it.  This is harsh Friday.  Everything has to be a little harsher today, boys.  Let's go.  I want to know, why would the child's clothes still be in there?  Why would the kid be naked?  Why are they in the filter?  It's impossible.  Oh, I don't know what's going on over there with this pool.  Let's go to Maurice.  Maurice?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Maurice. 
[00:50:00]  Hey.  Um, a couple days ago, she was on The View, uh, excuse me for watching The View, but she  was on The View, and she went at it with, uh, Joy, Joy Behar, and, uh, she was really  going at it, saying, uh, we can't talk about this.  We can't talk about this.  And Joy's like, well, you put it in your book.  You put it in your book.  Yeah.  And it's the same exact thing.  What the fuck?  This is, this is what's so strange about that.  The only reason everyone is having her on is because of all this controversy that happened  to her.  Yeah.  If she's just a regular, you know, hot bra that won some pageant or was in a pageant, 
[00:50:30]  no one's going to have her on.  Could, could we, is there a synopsis of the book?  Is there, like, some kind of synopsis about the book?  Because I want to know, if she's not talking about that or, or any other shit, what the  fuck is in this book?  She's probably had an exciting 22 years of life.  Yeah.  She said, I've had a lot of things, a lot of accomplishments.  I've accomplished a lot.  Still standing.  Still standing.  That's right.  You can't knock her down.  At 22.  Shut up.  You should have covered it.  22, you don't even know what the fuck's going on yet. 
[00:51:00]  Should be kneeling, is what it should be called.  Oh, look at, she's got the, the, uh,  the look to the future gaze above the camera.  She's looking off into her future.  Uh, Jim, she's not done yet.  No.  The untold story of my fight against gossip, hate, and political attacks.  Because she won't talk about it.  Because she won't talk about it.  To a huge audience.  Holy mother of Christ.  Because you can even talk about it, uh, stuff that's not in the book.  I hope nobody buys this fucking book.  I hope that Larry King, if you heard her sales, it had to. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  Because she came off as completely unrevealing.  Well, unfortunately, it'll do well the first week or two.  You know how that shit works.  Who's doing her book?  Are we fine?  We should, not that we'll get her in, but.  You just throw the name of a book on TV, and everyone just goes and buys it for some  reason.  Especially with Amazon, and right there, they fucking just click and order it.  It's amazing how, how dumb this society is.  None of us, and I mean none of us, me included, we just don't do our research on stuff.  Small percentage of people do.  Ah, we're just lemmings.  Oh, oh, okay. 
[00:52:00]  I'll buy this book.  A back cover kind of a thing that just kind of says what the fuck this asshole book is.  Wouldn't it be great if the back cover was a picture out of that porn video?  No, that would be good.  Probably the cuke.  From the inside flap.  Carrie Perjean had no idea when she walked down the stage to face her final question  before the selection and crowning of Miss USA that her hopes, dreams, and reputation were  about to come crashing down around her under a torment of media attacks. 
[00:52:30]  Her crime?  To have answered honestly that for her, and for most Americans, marriage is defined as  a sacred bond between one man and one woman.  For the thought crime of saying this, Carrie Perjean went from being the likely winner of  the Miss USA competition to being the certain loser.  But worse, she would be subject to a campaign of vilification, verbal abuse, and betrayal that 
[00:53:00]  did not even end with her being stripped of her title of Miss California.  Here at last is Carrie's own story.  The full story about what actually happened.  In still standing, you'll learn the behind-the-scenes truth of how and why Carrie's own pageant  director joined forces with the vicious smear campaign against her.  The intimidation that kept many of Carrie's supporters quiet.  How Donald Trump defended her only to back down under pressure from the pageant directors. 
[00:53:30]  Why liberal targets conservatives' women for special persecution.  And how political correctness is becoming a clear and present danger to free speech.  She endured the hellish nightmare that the liberal media can inflict upon us.  Shut your fucking God!  Hold on, I'll be right back.  There's nothing about how she...  What?  It sounds...  I mean, it does sound scandalous.  All the questions Larry was asking were about that. 
[00:54:00]  Ann?  Yes?  I'm going to Amazon.com.  This sounds like a terrific report.  Oh, you're going to order it?  No.  Fucking...  Oh, God, what a fucking...  You know, when the controversy hit, we were all on her side because we...  Yeah.  She answered honestly.  She turned it around and made us hate her.  Yeah, we didn't really...  A hot chick turned it around.  A hot conservative chick.  Yeah.  I don't think we agreed with her answer.  I didn't agree with her answer. 
[00:54:30]  Did you...  No.  No, I agreed with the fact that I can look at her answer and say, yeah, that's fine for  her to say that.  Yeah.  I don't give a shit.  We defended...  Two Moes want to fucking marry?  What am I...  She was asked and she gave an honest answer.  We liked that about her.  Yeah.  We thought Perez Hilton was the dick in that situation.  Perez Hilton's an asshole for...  But now she's just a twat.  Oh, wait.  It's Harsh Friday.  She's a cunt.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Harsh Friday.  Harsh Friday.  Get a fucking sweeper, please.  Where's D-Boy today?  Is he obsessing about Lion's Gate or can we get a Harsh Friday sweeper today? 
[00:55:00]  Face down in the production studio.  To your Lion's Gate.  You suck.  Oh, really?  Her book is number 665.  Oh, 665.  When's it due out?  Next Tuesday?  Oh, it came out Tuesday.  Oh, good.  She's not even doing well.  Whoopsie.  Yeah, but this video is being played everywhere.  It makes it look terrible.  It makes her look terrible.  I'm hoping.  Let's pay close attention to this.  See how much this moves up.  It's going to move up a little bit.  You know that.  It makes it look like she's not going to be honest in the book. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, and it makes her look like a snot who has nothing to say.  It doesn't make...  Like, if she had gone after Larry King for a legitimate reason, like if they had gone  back and forth on her answer, or if she had gone after a caller about her gay marriage  answer, what, no, the publicist told you, you can't take fucking phone calls, you coward.  And Larry's not to take any phone calls.  I could see the fucking publicist talking to the fucking producer.  And Larry is not to go to the phones while she is there.  We do not want any phone calls. 
[00:56:00]  Yes.  Okay.  I'll tell Larry right away.  Yes.  I forgot.  Well, publicist...  As long as it's not a Monday when I'm relaxing.  I'm a man of leisure.  Leisure.  Publicists are another cancer in this business.  You're talking about the lawyers, but the publicists are right up there.  Yes, they are.  You know, these companies, these media companies got to start pushing back because the publicists, 
[00:56:30]  what they do is they go, look, you know, if you don't follow the rules with this broad,  you know who else we represent.  They're not going to be coming on your show, Larry.  So they put the pressure on Larry, and that's why you see Larry groveling.  And let me tell you something else.  The only thing a publicist will tell you not to talk about is the thing everyone wants  to hear about.  Correctamundo.  So, you know, let the person being interviewed decide, or let the show actually decide,  too, if that's appropriate.  Like, there are certain things.  I wouldn't do it just for shock value.  You're going to have somebody that's nice and shit come in and sit down and dredge up some 
[00:57:00]  old fucking crap about them.  If they want to talk about it, fine.  If not, you know, whatever.  Like, if she had just said, look, let's just say this.  I wanted it to be over.  I can't go into details even though I'd love to.  That would have deflected the whole thing.  Larry would have been satisfied with the answer.  Move on.  What's your book about?  She holds it up.  I hope it sells eight copies.  Oh, yeah, she held it up.  That fucking, thank God you brought out that nice annoying cover, too, because I didn't 
[00:57:30]  notice how she was looking off into the future.  Looking off into the, almost like, what's ahead for me now?  Yeah, I don't know.  I have such an exciting life.  There's so much there to shut it.  Hopefully, right off of camera view is Lexington Steel with his dick out.  I hope fucking Lexington Steel has his dick out.  And a fucking, there's a picture of Steve with a giant sandwich in front of him, and he's  very happy.  Yes.  Yes.  Can we start a promotion where our listeners just randomly rip pages out of the book? 
[00:58:00]  Why?  At Barnes and Nobles all over the country.  Huh?  No.  Why?  Why didn't anyone tell me I couldn't be a client over that?  Yeah, we'll definitely be in trouble.  I was just asking.  I don't know.  We can't.  No.  No.  No.  The answer is no?  All right.  No.  Unless they buy the book first.  Then you're free to do what they wish.  No, then everyone's going to buy the book.  No one will buy the book just to rip it out of the book.  What do you got in?  I forgot.  Shit.  I think of a whole lot.  I saw that.  I don't know.  The publicist probably being there, trying to help her, cost her a huge amount of money 
[00:58:30]  by not letting her talk about that.  You can see her looking at the publicist off, and the publicist is probably going, don't  answer.  Because publicists, again, they're all wannabe fucking talent.  They all want to be a part of the business somehow.  And they found a way to fucking glom on and fucking leech their way into the business.  They're like a lot of what agents do.  It makes them feel important, too, that they have power over the celebrity that they're  carting around, and especially the people that are interviewing the celebrity.  There's a thing, a publicist, like, when you look at whoever Tom Cruise's publicist is, 
[00:59:00]  is a good fucking publicist, or was, because of all the questions surrounding...  Wasn't it his sister for a while?  No, that was after.  That was like when he started getting a little odd.  Oh, right, right.  When people were being glib.  Yes, I remember.  But, you know, his publicist for a long time, man, like, a publicist can protect a star  who's fucking vulnerable.  You know what I mean?  Like, if you have possible issues that are going to come out, sometimes a publicist will  protect...  Like, you wonder, how did so-and-so's image fucking last as long as it did?  That just is good people around them.  John Travolta must have a good one.  Oof.  Absolutely.  That guy, I mean...  That plane photo should have been fucking front-page news. 
[00:59:30]  It wasn't.  Oh, with him giving a little kiss goodbye to a friend on the steps of an airplane.  How do you...  How does that...  What's that about?  Can we see that, Danny?  What the hell?  Did you see that?  Dick's hard?  Yeah.  Travolta...  You know...  What is that about?  No, no, I gotta give Danny credit again.  Within two seconds, he just puts Travolta's gay kiss, and there it is.  Look at that.  That is not how two friends say, take it easy. 
[01:00:00]  I love the caption, Travolta and pal, ready for takeoff.  You know, let me ask you something.  Before, like, Thanksgiving vacation, when we're all at the parking garage, and our cars  pull up, is there going to be a scene like this picture between me and Opie, or me and  Jimmy?  Well, maybe.  Possibly.  A Jimmy and Opie.  We could barely do a fist touch.  You don't do that.  They're leaning in for a real kiss.  He's in mid-pucker.  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  That's an on-the-lips kiss.  Well, what makes it even worse, I mean, no one really wants to kiss another man on the  lips.  Look at the close-up, yeah.  But, like...  But if you're going to, you don't put your arm around the guy's back.  Yeah, they're both putting arms around their back.  That's what makes it fucking, you know, a romantic kiss.  Are there other pictures of Travolta kissing on the lips, too?  Oh, God.  What is that about, man?  He's all fucking Petey Pucker.  He really is.  Oh, what the fuck is that about?  What is that? 
[01:01:00]  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Oh, what's that?  That must be it up.  Is that fake?  Is that a Photoshop?  No, no, it's probably at a...  So, Travolta is one of these guys that likes kissing men on the lips, I guess.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know either.  But it doesn't mean he's gay just because he kissed one guy on the lips.  Oh, well, Sam, how many men have you kissed?  I think three.  Yeah.  Was it Sam?  No, no, Tom.  And one was a homeless gentleman.  Am I correct in saying that? 
[01:01:30]  Okay, I don't know.  Who might have died from AIDS.  That's terrific.  I don't know.  That's terrific, Sam.  Why don't we take a break, Anne?  It's officially Harsh Friday.  Yeah, apparently so.  Oh, wow.  Saturday Night Fever 2.  Staying alive.  Staying alive was fucking good, man.  I don't know, but he killed it.  He looked good.  There was good music.  The dancing was hot.  The dancing would kick your tongue out.  That's the break.  Guy calls 911 to jerk off.  Yes.  We got Inside Edition reporting on the Sharon Osbourne apology.  This should be it, finally. 
[01:02:00]  Maybe.  Finally.  Yeah.  It's in all the papers today without our names.  Mentioned in the New York papers.  Pix News did a story about circumcision trends.  Trends?  Trends.  Trends.  We got a wife that catches a pedophile husband by posing as a schoolgirl online.  Goddamn sneaky Pete.  What a liar.  Okay.  And we got Colin Quinn, Patrice O'Neal, and I think Brother Weez is stopping by to say hi. 
[01:02:30]  Wow.  We got a busy show today.  Nice.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, we're doing the Tommy Lee?  This is an oldie, but goodie.  It's from N.E.W.  The rage you hear is this guy lying to us saying you were told not to talk about that.  That was just, I couldn't believe he went down that road.  No one tells us what to talk about.  Listen to the way he refers to Pam.  For the most part.  That's the most enraging part of it.  Yes.  All right.  This goes way back, obviously.  But know where this comes from, though.  A Larry King interview with Pam Anderson at the time, who basically was saying some awful 
[01:03:00]  things about Tommy Lee, and I believe his...  She said, I believe she said he gave her hepatitis.  Hepatitis.  She got hep C from him.  It was a big interview.  So we just happened to have Tommy Lee on our show the next day.  So we're like, we're basically asking, you know, for his side of the story that was  on CNN last night, and he's trying to tell us it's old news and blah, blah, blah.  We get into it a little bit.  And it was brand new news.  It just happened the night before that they apparently had hand, like, put their blood  together through a pinprick, like, as a corny marriage thing.  And I think that's what she was saying. 
[01:03:30]  I vaguely remember.  Really?  That's how it happened?  Yeah.  I don't know if you can through fucking unless it's really...  It's harsh Friday.  And it was not.  Really?  You saw the bad Tommy Lee has.  That's true.  It's not a pinprick, that's for sure.  You don't think he was breaking...  Yes, he has a bowling pin.  You don't think he was breaking some fucking skin?  That fucking monster?  Oh, yeah.  Could I have rushed into that line faster?  He was just a fucking...  Fucking Ernest Eager.  Look at Tommy's fucking big hog.  I'd rather not.  Although, that one picture looks like he's close to getting it stuck in a drawer. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, look at that.  It's sticking straight out, and he's making, like, a smoothie or something.  I don't know what he's doing.  He's got, like, fucking, I'd say eight and a quarter, eight and a half.  Yeah.  He's doing all right.  Yeah.  He's eight.  He's in better shape than me.  He's eight.  All right, let's go to this.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton.  If you're on hold, stay there, but we've got to go right to the hotline.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy.  Tommy!  Who, me?  Yeah.  I'm Mr. Lee.  What's up, Tommy?  What's up, guys?  No, we were just talking to everybody about paying for it.  I know.  I heard the conversation.  Yeah, escorts and hookers and stuff. 
[01:04:30]  You, uh...  I have to assume you've done that a couple of times, at least.  I think everyone should own one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  When you're Tommy Lee, you don't have to, though.  Yeah, see, that's just it.  You go out, you pick up some chick.  He's a rock star, and he has a mule the size of a small community.  Everyone knows about that.  Everyone's seen that on the tape.  Yeah, that made for some great Thanksgiving viewing, Tommy.  I'm so glad that we get to talk to you today, because I've always wanted to thank you. 
[01:05:00]  We brought that tape to Thanksgiving dinner, swear to God, and watched it upstairs while  mom and sis and the aunts were cooking the turkey.  We all went upstairs to see you rail, uh, Pam.  You perverts.  You perverts.  You know something, though?  Perverts.  You're lucky.  You're lucky.  You're lucky that you were endowed like that, because it was a big hit.  People saw the tape and went, wow, look at Tommy Lee's hog.  And, uh, you could have been one of those guys, a little puny thing, and then you'd  be going through life embarrassed.  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  Okay.  You gotta be psyched at that gun out there.  Who are you kidding?  Hell yeah.  If I got a 14-incher, I want the world to know.  I'd be happy with six.  Hey, Tommy, I gotta ask you.  I saw, uh, I saw Pam on, um, what the hell was she on last night?  CNN?  Larry King.  Larry King.  Why are we even, why are we even talking about the P word?  Because she, she was claiming that.  I gotta go, guys.  Bye.  Are you kidding?  Are you kidding? 
[01:06:00]  He hangs up for talking about Pam?  What a faggot.  What a dick.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Tommy.  Yeah.  Tommy.  What's, what's up, man?  Hey, why you guys call me a dick, dude?  What's up?  What's up?  Because you called up.  Like, we want to talk to you about a little bit of everything, and you hung up.  You know what?  You hold on.  You were told not to, you were, you were told not to bring up the P word.  What do you do?  No one told us anything.  Hey, Tommy, no one tells us what to do, first of all. 
[01:06:30]  And you were the big, no one tells us what to do.  No one told us not to bring up Pam's name.  We would never agree to that, okay?  Yes, yes, we were.  You were the big pussy for hanging up after we asked about it, instead of trying to talk  your way out of it.  You guys did agree to it.  We did not!  My tour manager talked to your producer.  That's bullshit.  Nope.  Nope.  We would never agree to that.  Sorry.  That's kind of a big story that we wanted to hear about.  You know what, guys?  What year are you guys living in?  It's like, dude, turn the page, guys. 
[01:07:00]  I've been divorced for three years.  Turn the page.  Turn the page.  It was big news last night when she was on Larry King accusing you of this.  Don't you think it's a current story if Pam is on Larry King saying pretty much that  you gave her hep C?  What was big news, guys?  What was big news?  Big news that she's on Larry King accusing you of giving her a hep C.  Dude, you know how many months ago she accused me of that?  It doesn't matter.  It happened last night on Larry King. 
[01:07:30]  Of course we're going to bring it up.  She talked about it last night.  You know what?  She talked about it in some other stupid magazines as well.  Who cares?  Yeah, but this is the first time we're talking to you, so we'd like to maybe talk to you  about it.  Maybe get your side of the story.  You've never really given your side of the story, right?  You know why?  Why?  Because it's nobody's business.  Well, she's made it everyone's business.  Of course she is.  She's an idiot.  I would just love to hear your side of it.  That's all.  If an ex is accusing me of some crazy things, you know what? 
[01:08:00]  I'm going on the biggest program I can find and then calling her a liar, a C, a twat.  Every name I can figure out.  Guys, I don't do that.  That's not my style, okay?  I don't do that crap.  That's why I just hung up the phone.  I was like, you know what?  I got to go.  Because that's not my style, guys.  It may be your style, but it ain't mine.  But you look like a pussy just hanging up.  We were totally confused.  You didn't even say the first time you're on the phone, hey, guys, I thought we agreed  to this.  You know what?  I'm telling you man to man that it never got to us that we couldn't talk about Pam because 
[01:08:30]  you know what?  We wouldn't have agreed to this interview.  You call me a pussy, I'm hanging up.  Pussy.  Wow, we need Tommy Lee to make a good radio show.  If you say that, I'll take my ball and not play.  I know.  I'm hanging up.  Pussy.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:09:00]  Chip Norton.  We're doing it.  Hey, this is, oh my God.  What is this?  It's killing me.  You're only going to hear this far.  Motorhead.  It is Motorhead?  I'm pretty sure.  That's right?  Yeah.  This is, uh, what song is it?  Killers.  What?  Killers.  Killers.  Killers.  Killers.  Killers.  I don't know much Motorhead to be honest with you, Jimmy.  They have some of the best riffs ever.  Three, just three guys. 
[01:09:30]  I know that ace of spades.  Yeah.  Runaround man.  Fucking best opening riff off a fucking album in ten years.  There's a new CD.  Really?  I, I personally love, can you, can you runaround man?  Do we have that?  It's just like the opening, it's just so fucking heavy, they're in their 60s.  You don't have Runaround Man from the fucking Motorizer?  No, that's.  What are we a fucking, what are we a bunch of queers?  They put dicks for everybody.  No, it's satellite radio, come on.  You can't expect them to have every song.  Thank you.  Uh, Inside Edition reported on Sharon Osbourne's apology. 
[01:10:00]  Boy, did we, uh, create a little something something, huh?  A little worldwide, uh, controversy.  Fucking Sharon was just being honest.  She was being funny.  I had a dream that she was back on our show last night.  Just remember that as I sit here.  She'll be back on it, because nobody fucked her over.  I mean, she, you know, she's on a radio show.  Sharon's not stupid.  She knows.  She was just being funny, and people took it wrong, and that's it.  You know?  But she knows, she knows what she's doing.  Yeah.  It probably went a little farther than she thought it would. 
[01:10:30]  So then she went, look, sorry, because then, you know, Kelly's doing Dancing with the Stars,  and she doesn't want her to have to deal with it, and so she's...  Yeah, she probably did it more to, uh, protect, uh, Kelly.  Yeah.  Oh, I understand.  Yeah.  I completely understand that she had to give the fake apology, which it is.  Yeah.  And then everyone goes, okay, she apologized.  But those people are smart enough to know it's a fake apology.  Yeah, it's fake.  I think we have brought it out to everybody that these apologies are fake apologies.  No one else has admitted that in the media. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, no one...  God, we're fucking brilliant, man.  No one has even brought up the subject of the fake apology.  I say Mooney is on, uh, Imus plugging a fucking book.  I wish we would have had Mooney in.  He would really get the phones lit.  I bet Imus is, uh, gonna be on his best behavior here.  Imus is gonna take a beating.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know about that.  Mooney's a racist fuck, man.  He really is.  He's funny.  I'll give him that.  He's funny.  But, oh, he enrages me.  What a queen, too.  But he's, you know what?  Jesus.  He is nicer than you think. 
[01:11:30]  Like, I did the fucking Gene Simmons roast.  I'm like, this guy's gonna be the biggest...  Because I've met him many times, and he never actually remembers me.  And he was fucking fantastic to be on the...  Was he?  Yeah.  Can you do your Paul Mooney?  I love it.  I don't feel like doing that shit.  I love it.  Now y'all, oh, fay, motherfucker.  I love fucking doing Paul Mooney.  That's not a particularly great one, but...  Did we book him?  No, we should.  I mean, he's fucking...  We talked to him on the phone once, right after the Michael Richards thing.  Right.  But Mooney says whatever the fuck he wants. 
[01:12:00]  He's everything...  He's exactly what a comedian should be.  He's not always right, but he's always fucking honest.  Sure.  He really does not like white people.  Good.  But let him...  Like, I love the fact that he sits there.  You ought to see him.  He sits on a stool with a Chardonnay, like a fucking true gentleman, attacking crackers.  Yeah.  It's three hours of attacking whiting.  He drinks Chardonnay on stage?  It's the fucking...  It might be a...  It's a gentleman's beverage.  Yeah.  That's not a...  That's a chick drink.  Maybe it's not Chardonnay.  It's a...  It could be Scotch.  Who fucking drinks Chardonnay? 
[01:12:30]  It sounds like that gay kids in the hall character, remember when you would sit up on stage with wine?  See, there's a photo of Mooney on stage.  I don't know many guys that drink Chardonnay, to be honest with you, Jimmy.  I'm actually saying Chardonnay.  It's like a wine glass, but it could be Scotch or...  It's a beverage that you sip.  It's a gentleman's beverage.  I agree with you that white people suck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure Imus is keeping it very safe for himself.  Imus is getting brave again.  You notice that?  Really?  Because Paul...  Yes.  Paul Mooney.  I mean, you can get some stuff said on that. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, but you know what?  That's not brave.  That's like...  No, because Imus could defend his point, you know, because Paul Mooney's going to let it  out there.  And that puts Imus in a position where he's got to maybe say something that could be a  little dangerous.  What's with you colored people?  Oh, yeah.  It's infuriating.  All right.  We'll watch the TV now.  Like my hat.  What the fuck?  We're just looking at two guys talking.  We can't even hear what they're saying.  It's ridiculous.  We really need the ability to just go to any one of these TVs at any moment. 
[01:13:30]  Punch it up.  We can't do that?  Well, there's got to be an easier way to do it instead of running for remotes and putting  that TV on that TV.  You know what I mean?  Like, you've got to move Imus to that TV and then we can get it up on the board.  You should have like a fucking switchboard there where you just go click, click, click.  Why don't we have Mooney?  Where's Mars?  Get Mars.  Can we get that done?  Because we talk about Maury and that monster that does that fucking talk show.  Yeah, we have to be able to go like, bam, right there.  But how cool would it be if we just go, you know, around... 
[01:14:00]  The coolest thing ever.  We'll just go around the TV every once in a while.  Yay.  So we can call out these fuckers.  Mars Friday.  Is D-Boy working on The Sweeper?  D-Boy.  D-Boy.  D-Boy.  I guess he's not going to watch that movie, what is it called?  Precious?  Did you see the preview for this fucking movie, Precious?  Oh, oh, um...  Is it called Precious?  Oprah's all over it.  Yeah, what's it about?  They're saying Oscars for everybody.  It's just this down and dirty fucking black movie that the kid is having... 
[01:14:30]  Oh, the big fat kid?  Yeah, the big fat black kid is having her second kid.  It's 16 years old and her mom is played by that comedian, that fucking black woman.  It's not Lonnie Love, it's...  Help me out, somebody.  Monique?  Monique.  Ugh, Monique.  And Monique is just completely abusive, hitting her with frying pans and trying to throw her  down the stairs and shit.  Is it...  It is...  This movie looks brutal.  I don't know why you... 
[01:15:00]  No, it's not Miss Peaches.  No.  She's not in the movie.  I don't know why anyone would go to a movie theater to watch this.  It looks downright depressing.  Does it?  Really depressing, but it's getting amazing reviews.  Oh, well...  The movie that's not getting good reviews is...  There go the Oscars.  ...is John Cusack.  Ah, yes.  2012.  2012.  It just...  Every trailer you see, it's just one big CGI effect.  Yeah.  It's like, you know, how about some kind of storyline?  I don't know what the hell the storyline's supposed to be, but it kind of looked like that 
[01:15:30]  Tom Cruise movie, you know, Invasion and the fucking...  You know, Martian...  Help me out.  Oh, the one where...  Yeah, War of the Worlds.  Dude, can we talk about War of the Worlds?  I know we've done it a bunch of times, but...  Yeah.  When he takes his family to...  Whose house was it?  His sister's or his aunt's or his...  Actually, I think it was the ex-wife's house.  Or the ex-wife's house.  The ex-wife was going somewhere.  She lives in a really nice house in the suburbs, and they wake up to find that a jet crashed  into their house?  Yeah.  They slept through a jet crashing through their house? 
[01:16:00]  They thought it was one of those big creature-y things, so they didn't go out.  What the hell?  And then they woke up, and there's wreckage all over the place.  Well, I understand it's a movie about aliens attacking the world, so you kind of got to,  you know...  Yeah.  Put your thoughts, your intelligence aside a little bit, but you want us to believe  a jet also crashed into the house overnight and no one, you know, noticed?  Yeah.  Doesn't he open the front door and there's a jet on the front yard or something?  Yeah, there is.  It's wreckage everywhere.  There's wreckage, like, all over the place. 
[01:16:30]  That stuff drives me nuts.  But they heard the sound of the jet, and they thought it was one of the big monsters, one  of the big machining monster things, and kind of hid in the basement.  But you realize what a jet could do, damage-wise?  They'd be so stupid.  Of course they would.  I saw that.  I saw that in Universal Studios.  I did.  We came around.  It's like...  You look to the left, you'll see the house from...  Oh, it's psycho.  Oh, look, the Bates Motel.  And as we go up here, you'll see the house is actually a lot smaller than a standard house. 
[01:17:00]  This was forced perspective.  A lot of the shots were done from the motel point of view.  Looking up the hill, it made the house look bigger than it actually is.  Now, as we continue our tour, you'll see, here's the plane crash scene from all other  worlds.  That completely takes you out of the psycho thing.  Because I could see the plane crash scene from the psycho house, and it sucks.  Oh, really?  Thank you. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  They fucked it all.  I'm still doing the tour.  I got so depressed when I realized the psycho house was a tiny little house.  It's a little fucking tiny house.  That really bothered me for some reason.  You can't even go in there.  I don't know why it bothered me, but I think the house was like three feet tall.  It's a tiny little house.  It's some ridiculous size.  We'd like to continue the Universal Studios tour, but everything apparently is burnt down.  There's no more fucking Back to the Future fucking sets.  There's nothing.  Everything burnt down.  We're so sorry.  Didn't they lose the King Kong thing?  Yeah, everything's dead.  Everything burnt up.  The plane crashed into it. 
[01:18:00]  All right.  Yeah, that's the plane crash.  And, of course, as we go around back, you'll see there's nothing back here.  This is what we call a facade or false front.  Thank you.  There goes the tour.  Now go buy some fucking $20 hamburgers.  Jimmy, look at the picture.  We're supposed to believe that that crashed into the house overnight while they were sleeping in the basement.  I don't know why that bothers me so much, but it just does.  Universal Studios has to get rid of the Jaws thing, too. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  It looks so bad.  Is that the actual one, though?  It's not, right?  No.  Is it a replica, at least?  It's probably some kind of bad replica of it.  You can see it coming under the water.  You can see the track because it's too shallow.  You know it's coming.  Yeah, we're making our way around.  Here is Amity.  We're on Amity Island now as we bring the tram around.  Now, be careful, people.  Get your hands in.  Keep it in because sometimes we've had some shark sightings around here. 
[01:19:00]  And, uh-oh, I see a fin.  Oh, no.  We're going to have to stop.  Here it comes.  Oh, get your cameras ready.  Oh, my God.  Look at the shark.  It's coming out of the water.  All right, now we're going to go over the bridge that feels like it's falling down.  It's like, oh, that was a close one.  Well, that certainly was a close call.  And to take you out of that, we'll go right into our Battlestar Galactica set where some  Cylon warriors are shooting us with bad laser beams.  Fucking awful tour that was. 
[01:19:30]  All right, let's do that.  I have a correction, by the way.  Yes.  A Twitter listener, I think you may have meant sipping cognac through a brandy sip.  Right from a brandy snifter, which is what I may have been killing.  Oh, so he's sipping cognac.  It could have been cognac.  That's what I meant.  That's a lot different than Chardonnay.  That's the shark.  Is that really the shark?  Why is there red X's on his nose?  I don't know.  Can you give him a kiss?  That's horrible.  What's the red X's?  Is that supposed to look like smeared blood?  Yeah, it's probably supposed to look like that.  It looks like an inflatable.  That is horrible. 
[01:20:00]  You know, I bet you that the original shark actually scared people that they had the original mechanical  shark.  So, Disney had to, like, kind of dumb it down and make it a little faker.  It wasn't set up to do that is what it is.  The original shark was, you know, very temperamental from what I read when they were making the movie.  And it was only set up to do certain moves.  So, they had to build something special for this and they kind of went on the cheap, I guess.  Well, no.  The other thing with Jaws, we were supposed to see the shark a hell of a lot more. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And they just couldn't get the damn thing to work.  And then that was the brilliance of, what's his name there?  Spillberg.  Spillberg, obviously.  Yes, thank you.  That they, he said, fuck it, I'm going to film this anyway.  And then, you know, not knowing and not seeing the shark as much actually made that movie.  Yeah, that was good.  So, that was good.  The one cool shot of the shark is from the orca when it passes by and you realize the size of it.  Oh, yeah.  That was cool, yeah.  Yeah.  For the time especially, you know.  That was just mechanical pneumatic shit that they had to actually make work instead of CGI. 
[01:21:00]  It was so great when Roy Scheider came over and he goes, you're going to need a bigger boat.  Oh, yeah.  When it jumps out, he tries chumming this shit.  Let's go get a bigger boat.  We need a bigger boat.  The opening scene, though, with that.  It's great.  The woman freaking skinny bitching.  Oh, Chrissy.  Takes her clothes off.  I remember getting so excited.  It was a beautiful summer night where the fucking moon and the stars are out so you could kind of still see.  I got a raging boner when I went to the movies and saw that.  Did you really?  I just got back from California. 
[01:21:30]  That was like porn.  And Chrissy took her clothes off and jumped in.  And when she's kind of, the underwater shot and her legs are kind of moving and you saw her muff, like as she's underwater, that was, I was like, ooh.  I'm sitting there like.  I used to breathe so heavily.  When you got a boner?  Yeah.  When I see, like, nudity.  When she ran.  When I was a kid, it was crazy.  When she ran, you saw, like, side boob, too, right?  Yeah.  That was amazing.  Turn on, too.  It was, they put a filter on that shot.  It was done in daylight. 
[01:22:00]  That shot was done?  Yeah, it was completely daylight.  And they put a filter on it to make it look like it was nighttime or kind of dawn or, you know.  Of course.  And some of the shots are a little lighter than others.  Yeah.  How else would they have done it at night?  And you could see the reflection of the sun, which is supposed to be the reflection of  the moon there.  But, yeah, that was, to me, was like, oh.  The lighting of that scene was amazing.  Yeah.  It really was.  It's done really well.  Wait, there was four girls that ran into the water?  No, that's one of those.  Oh.  Oh, I thought you were joking. 
[01:22:30]  That's one of those shots where they show four shots.  Oh, okay.  No, I look quickly.  Yeah, look.  Yeah.  That got me so fucking turned on.  I'm like, her pussy's right there.  It's right there.  The shark can eat her pussy.  I used to have a fantasy.  Let me tell you the sick fantasy I used to have.  Yeah.  I had a fantasy that there was a naked girl, and she was about one foot tall.  Jesus, Ed.  She was totally naked, one foot tall, and I would just lick her all over.  I would, like, put her in my mouth and then pull her out of my mouth. 
[01:23:00]  What an asshole.  No, it was a little, it was a one foot, not even, maybe six inches tall or something.  And she was completely naked, and I would just, like, lick her hiney, and you're begging  for Lydia to call.  And then she'll call and have no idea what this is about as well.  I don't know what it means.  I'll tell you what it means.  You were a fucking jerk.  That's what it means.  A complete jerk.  I know.  Oh, that just made me remember when I was thinking of the shark eating her and stuff. 
[01:23:30]  It made me remember that I used to fantasize about putting little sized women in my mouth.  Tony lives in my mouth.  That's got to mean something.  I'm sorry.  I'm eating pussy now, Mrs. Torrance.  I'm not a sposta.  Who says you're not supposed to?  The little one foot girl who lives in my mouth.  Yeah, you are Tony.  You're Tony.  Tony.  So, I guess we're talking about movies.  Horrible.  John Cusack was on CBS Early Show. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Promoting this 2012.  That looks like it's going to be a bust.  That pirate radio movie's not getting a lot of good reviews either.  That looks fucking extreme.  And, yeah, woo, woo, we're pirates, man.  On a boat, man.  We're breaking the law.  We rush.  Right.  Not going to see that?  No, they remind me of, they took the Twister crew and put them on a boat to run a radio station.  Twister was all right.  Yeah! 
[01:24:30]  I got to tell you, I saw a film yesterday.  Patton Oswalt is coming in to promote, is it called Fanboy?  I'm a fan.  I'm a fan?  I'm a fan.  Is that what it's called, Danny?  Can you look that up?  I'm a fan.  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  And I thought it was going to be a comedy.  And this fucking movie's really dark.  It's a weird movie.  Yeah.  Patton Oswalt plays kind of a psychopath.  He looks like one.  He's an obsessed fan of the New York Giants.  It's a whole football thing.  It's a Giants versus Eagles. 
[01:25:00]  And I'm waiting for the last for the first 20 minutes, because I don't know what I'm watching,  because I haven't heard much about this movie.  And I'm like...  If you don't laugh within the first 20 minutes, change the channel.  And that's what I was about to do.  And then I realized, oh, wait a minute.  This is a fucking thriller slash kind of drama.  No, like a thriller.  A weird thriller.  Yeah.  And I got to tell you, I got to give it two thumbs up.  I got to go to school and say two thumbs up on this Patton Oswalt movie.  Big fan, it's called, Jimmy.  Big fan.  Big fan, right.  It's an independent film, and it's got some nice buzz. 
[01:25:30]  And I think Patton Oswalt's coming in to promote the movie, and I saw it yesterday, and  I liked it.  Yeah, me too.  I definitely...  You saw it?  Yeah.  When did you see it?  A few days ago, because I know Patton's a friend of mine.  We haven't come in, so I watched the movie.  And you got to see it, then.  Then for once, all three of us will see something.  That would be cool.  Very difficult for me to take any spare time I have and not be playing Modern Warfare.  Yeah, we're going to get to that in a second.  It's very difficult.  Yeah.  What did you like about the movie there, Jim, before we move on? 
[01:26:00]  I thought Patton was good.  I liked the guy he played a lot.  Did you like the ending?  In a way, I did, yeah.  Not the ending ending, the big...  Yeah.  I didn't mind it because it kind of was silly, and it was kind of a surprise, and it wasn't  what I expected.  So I did like it just because I got annoyed, so I'm like, I see this coming from a mile  away, but then I realized, oh, you didn't see it coming.  So I kind of liked it.  It took me somewhere I thought it was going to take me, and then changed.  What an asshole he plays.  What a dummy. 
[01:26:30]  What a jerk.  But I also like, he played, let's just say this, he plays a guy who's obsessed with sports  radio as well, and he calls in...  You notice who's the guy?  Pharrell, yeah, yeah.  He was good, though.  Pharrell was really good in this movie as a sports fucking talk show host.  I know this is going to drive Anthony nuts, but...  Fuck him.  Good for him.  Good.  You're in a movie.  Only his voice.  Oh, only his voice.  Only his voice, yeah, because he's listening to sports radio.  What a guy.  I made up with a guy.  It was easy, easy, easy. 
[01:27:00]  I never made up with him.  Never.  I'll never be close with a guy again, but I made up with him.  He attacked me for no reason.  He attacked all of us for no reason.  Yeah, he had no reason to attack us.  Just to kiss Howard's ass.  You don't have to fucking kiss Howard's ass.  You could all work here in the same company and not have to hate us for...  Michio Kaku's on the...  He's got to be talking about 2012 and how it's all bullshit.  You know something?  Yeah, he is.  Uh, we should pull this and see if he treats these people like complete fucking idiots.  I would like to know what he's saying to these people. 
[01:27:30]  He treats us like we're in kindergarten class.  Probably them, third grade.  And, yeah.  He probably punches it up a little bit for them.  You think he punches it up to, like, elementary school?  Yeah, a little bit.  And I just want to hear...  I want to get a text from Dr. Steve about what a complete tool he is.  Sure.  Fuck me, Michio Kaku.  So Steve hates him.  So Scott Farrell is the sports talk show host of this movie.  Fucking noise.  You can't cover up that you're not saying anything by making noise. 
[01:28:00]  Enough.  Just give us the scores and shut up.  You don't like when he sings Metallica songs for 20 minutes?  I don't like anything he does.  I don't like the fact that he's fucking...  People look and think he's funny when he's just making noises.  I'm very confused.  And I'm very confused because I'm the one that holds a grudge.  And I'm over this.  I'm completely held a grudge on that guy.  I'm over this, but I will never be close with the guy again.  You are really holding a grudge on this one.  I'm holding a grudge on him.  Well, you want him to at least come in and explain himself? 
[01:28:30]  No, fuck him.  Why even give him the time of day?  He never apologized to me for...  No.  Again, a bad mouth on me on the fucking air.  I'm not that hypersensitive, but I did his show when we were off the air.  He was really cool.  And I had one of their comedians on.  He sucked.  It was completely a sucker punch to us.  There was no reason for it.  And when he was down on his luck, we were there for him big time.  Oh, please.  Supporting him big time.  Not too much.  Fucking support of the guy. 
[01:29:00]  Well, you know what happens.  There's a lot of insecurity in radio, and these guys feel like they have to kiss up to Howard  or Howard's not going to love them or something.  It's bizarre to me.  It's so bizarre to me.  There's a whole list of guys like that.  It's like, just be yourselves.  And you can appreciate Howard.  You can go on the show.  You can fucking talk whatever you want.  But then, just to badmouth us out of nowhere, it's ridiculous.  If we had fucking fucked him over in some way, then fine.  Then, you know, touche, whatever.  We were what I thought were, you know, at least professional friendships, those things 
[01:29:30]  that you have, you know, when you work in the same business and building and shit like  that.  And then he just turns around and badmouthed us and bashed us for no reason.  Fuck him.  I think he, I'll, I'll, I'm not delusional.  I'll give him his, his props.  When it comes to calling, uh, games, I think he's good.  He knows a lot about sports.  Um, he, he, he'll throw his opinion in there.  But 99% of his show is his inane babbling drivel that isn't funny. 
[01:30:00]  Uh, it, it's annoying as fuck and it detracts from, uh, what you're trying to do, which  I guess is a sports show by making noises and telling stories that go on and on with  no fucking ending whatsoever.  There's a complete lack of entertainment in any story he tells.  We get it.  You drank Jameson and don't remember, uh, doing something.  Ooh, you're a rebel.  You owe the hotel money. 
[01:30:30]  Who cares?  Shut it.  God, I hate that guy.  Fuck him.  Jesus.  Like I said, it's usually me that holds the grudge.  I'll remind Anthony of something.  He's like, what?  You're still fucking pissed off about that?  That was 12 years ago.  I know.  I know.  Yes, fuck him.  It's kind of refreshing to know it's you this time.  Yeah.  He should be one of those auctioneers. 
[01:31:00]  Right.  Well, with that aside, the movie was, uh, good.  Yeah, I mean, look, they all used his voice and he played, he was, you know, he was good.  That part was good.  But that Patton, I thought was great because...  Yeah, I didn't expect, I didn't know he could act like that.  An awkward, annoying caller, but who thought he was making good sports points and you're  like, what a douche.  Oh, cool.  Like, you know, we're going to hand them their heads on Sunday. 
[01:31:30]  You're like, ugh.  Ew.  That's exactly like a sports caller, though.  Yeah, yeah.  He was great.  Wow.  Yeah, he really fucking, he really nailed that.  Yeah.  I think you would like the movie, and you should see it.  I'm gonna.  Try to see it this weekend.  You think this is a transitional phase for Patton?  Or do you think this is going to be one of those, like, uh, crossover moments?  Right back to the comedy clubs, he's gonna slink.  I think he's just, I think he's just perfect for this particular role.  I don't think it's, it'll be a trend.  Nah, nah, not at all.  No?  But he's very interesting.  He can act. 
[01:32:00]  No success.  No, no, he actually can act.  He shouldn't, he shouldn't write a book with a picture of him on the cover looking to  the future.  No!  He should just turn around and look at Chuckles, the Chuckle Hut behind him.  Oh, yeah, he should be looking to the future.  There's an improv in it.  Oh, Carrie presents her cover.  Makes me sick.  Oh, fuck her.  Danny, why do you keep, I'm trying to get Danny to pop something up.  He just refuses to on the computer.  What, his wee-wee?  What are you popping up?  I'm having, I'm having some computer troubles.  No kidding.  What's the matter with the computer?  You know, Firefox is having trouble recovering.  You know, Firefox.  Some days it works really nicely and I don't even notice. 
[01:32:30]  And then other days, this is my third time rebooting.  I love how we just don't know when it decides to.  Why do you love Firefox?  I don't understand.  I love how we, I love how we blame the company when it could obviously be what we put up  there on that screen on a daily basis.  Yeah, I'm sorry guys.  I was trying to get the 2012 trailer for you.  Must have been on some terrible website.  I'm thinking it could be some of the horrific stuff we probably had up there yesterday, earlier  this morning.  Who the fuck knows?  That Belladonna blowjob is one of the sexiest blowjobs I've ever seen.  That fucking first, that one she gave in that movie where she's just loving that dick. 
[01:33:00]  It's all innocence.  Knowing that was her first movie is just a huge turn on.  Dude, I want that to be my cock.  There's a market out there, I was saying to you guys.  Porn stars doing their first fucking movie would be just, there's something to be said  about that.  I think that would sell very, very well.  Oh, look at what we got on line one.  Maybe we should take that call and do a little psychoanalyzing on me.  No, because she doesn't know shit.  I want to hear what it is.  Lydia, you don't know shit.  Lydia, let me reiterate for listeners just joining us. 
[01:33:30]  I had conveyed a fantasy I had when I was a child, probably age seven to nine, around  those years, around there.  I had a fantasy of a nude woman that was about six inches tall and I would put her in my mouth  and just lick, lick this, and she was living, you know, it was a living six inch tall woman  that I would lick all over her nude body and put in my mouth and kind of take it out like 
[01:34:00]  a popsicle.  What does that mean?  I think that's perfectly normal, Anthony, especially for a six or seven year old, eight year old boy.  Why?  Well, you know, you're starting to feel your sexual urges, but grown up women are a little  bit big for a boy that age.  Oh, that makes sense.  They're big and scary.  So I wanted the tiny girl that fits in my mouth. 
[01:34:30]  Goddamn, quiet, you rabble rouser.  Yeah, about Barbie doll size.  Yeah, I would guess around there.  All right.  Well, thanks for telling me I'm normal.  I am here to support you, Anthony.  Thank you.  All right, Lydia.  How's the hangover today?  How's the hangover today, Lydia?  And those giant tits.  Yeah, we all know the weekend starts on Thursday.  So how was the hangover?  Oh, no, it's okay.  Thank you very much.  My giant tits is shoved in my work shirt.  And I'm ready to roll. 
[01:35:00]  Nice.  All right.  Have a fun weekend.  Thank you.  You too.  You too.  All right.  If anything, I didn't think that would be normal.  Hey, let's do this.  So John Cusack was promoting 2012 on CBS Early Show, and he said a naughty word.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I think they're doing this on purpose at this point.  These days, they're just testing the waters.  It becomes a huge YouTube clip, and it's good marketing for the movie.  I really do.  I'm suspicious of this now.  You think they said, hey, drop the F-bomb?  And you know the FCC, one curse word at this point, they're not really going to bother you. 
[01:35:30]  Not these days.  No, this administration.  Does it seem like 20 years ago already?  Some mornings, yeah.  I can feel a little bit older than others.  But I'm always amazed that people still remember the movie, but it was a really fun time in my life.  I guess he was talking about when he was a little kid in those movies.  No, it's the 20th anniversary, believe it or not, of Say Anything.  Oh, wow.  What did he say anything?  Really?  That was a movie where he's holding up the boombox with Peter Gabriel. 
[01:36:00]  What song was he playing?  I never heard of it.  It's a very famous movie scene.  Yeah, it is.  He's trying to get the girl back, so he's got the boombox.  And what song was he playing?  Where have I been?  Not Red Rain.  Fucking.  Shit.  John Cumsac.  Kurt Love just called him John Cumsac.  I don't know.  I find that so funny.  Oh, In Your Eyes.  Right, right.  Wow.  In Your Eyes.  Same time, yeah. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  It's all CGI effects and pandemonium going on.  I mean, obviously the trailer is ridiculous just because they're outrunning basically death  by an inch in a gigantic limo that's doing 90.  But the acting is so incredibly terrible.  In the trailer?  Oh, my God.  Can we hear the trailer?  The whole thing is just awful.  And there are millions of people dying here.  Yeah, but they're the ones that are making it.  But how are they making it through this street?  Right.  Like, there's a giant highway falling. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  A cabbie stops to pull over, you know, pull over to get a fare.  Yeah.  And there's gridlock in New York, in Manhattan for the last 15 minutes.  Buildings and everything is falling.  Everything's collapsing.  And this guy is still going, you know, real fast.  I want to hear some of the acting.  Is it bad?  There's an in the limo moaning.  Building.  They crash through a building that is falling.  Aerial shot. 
[01:37:30]  It's very good.  It's pretty cool, though.  I mean, Dawn of the Dead, it was used very well.  I like that.  The newer one they made with thing rings.  Were they trying to get to the Air Force?  There's a...  Oh, well, the runways are collapsing.  TMP, watch temperatures and pressures.  Let's go, man.  Let's do my pre-flight checklist.  Let him have some pre-flight.  Pre-flight checklist.  Stop it.  Why would you do a pre-flight checklist?  With the runway crumbling behind you.  That's the shit that drives me nuts in movies.  They're always just escaping the floor caving. 
[01:38:00]  And how do they do that?  Well, it's a movie about the end of the world.  I guess you have to suspend disbelief.  Yeah.  No, I understand.  That's what...  Oh, look at that.  They made it.  They took off.  And the entire runway just collapsed.  They're up.  Oh, fucking climb, dummy.  Why is he in the fucking rut in the ground?  Pull back on the yoke.  Exactly.  No time for yokes.  And they're watching just the complete destruction. 
[01:38:30]  You caught that, didn't you?  Oh, yeah, I did.  You caught it, too.  Of course.  We all did.  This is awful.  They're in a plane.  It's just facial expressions and...  Whoa!  Why is he flying above the...  Why fly an inch off the ground?  Why is he climbing?  The plane was barely 10 feet off the ground.  No, who does that?  Who flies through wreckage like this?  Oh, my God.  Oh, are they going to have to go sideways through the building?  Why could they go around the other way?  Sideways.  There you... 
[01:39:00]  Of course.  Right between the buildings at a 90-degree bank.  Right.  And none of the bricks fall on them?  At fucking 50 feet.  Well, I don't understand why you couldn't fucking go the other way.  How about going up?  Up above that shit.  Bunch of crap.  This movie will rot.  Look.  Uh-oh.  Here.  What's here?  What are we looking at?  Hopefully the script has a duty on it.  2012 is what this movie should gross. 
[01:39:30]  Nope.  All right.  I thought you kind of left me hanging on my yoke.  The yoke's on me.  It was very hurt.  Very hurt.  No matter where you live.  Yeah.  It's all wrong.  No matter what you believe.  Yeah.  I don't like the fact they won't show up.  A Muslim thing being destroyed.  Yeah, of course not.  Why would they do that?  Final trip.  Is trailer longer?  I don't know if that point had to make it for us. 
[01:40:00]  No, I don't know.  One date will unite us all.  November 25th at the Stress Factory.  Oh, Jimmy.  Nice.  Well, whatever.  Well, that looks like shit.  El Skippo.  Patrice O'Neal and Colin Quinn.  What's up, guys?  Look at that.  Can you imagine?  You can knock me over the feather.  Hey, Mr. Quinn.  How are you, sir?  Go ahead and get downstairs.  Patrici.  How you doing?  Patrici. 
[01:40:30]  Good morning.  Good morning to you.  Got to turn some mics on over here.  It's not like Patrice's power move where he sits in one chair.  Just because, like, he's been on.  He's more of a regular view.  I'm still bigger than you.  As they said outside, Colin's doing Caroline's.  Patrice is doing Hezburg Heights.  You know what?  You're not going to get us to defend that statement, Colin.  We've been begging for you to come in here.  We're like, where's Colin?  We call for you.  We're hoping for you to run down here in your pajamas.  And you haven't been around.  We miss the days where you come running in with your pajamas on.  That was when you were on 57th.  And holy shit, have you lost a lot of weight. 
[01:41:00]  God damn, what's that about?  I know.  First thing I've got to do, I want to apologize to Patrice.  I was having the worst week ever when you called me.  Oh, and I was trying to get in touch with you.  And I didn't get back to you.  And I want to apologize to you because, yeah, it was a crisis.  I just want to hear.  It's okay.  I don't take a break.  I just want to hear what Sammy Solstead has to say here.  Bleached skin face on it.  I want to hear what clear skin has to say over here.  What are you talking about?  Is it a healthy weight loss? 
[01:41:30]  What's that?  Healthy weight loss?  Yes.  It can't.  It can't.  Fucking lymph node cancer.  How much have you lost, Colin?  60 old together.  60 fucking pounds.  Jesus.  Nice glass of chemo.  I'm going to tell you why it's not working out.  Because he still has the I don't work out stomach.  That's why he didn't work out.  It's just a fat gut.  Are you working out or are you just eating right?  Um, I am working out in any way, but unfortunately, Fatso is correct. 
[01:42:00]  And you can tell he's getting old people ears when he just, oh, this motherfucker.  What the hell?  My ears are always like this.  What do you call my old people ears?  He has big old people ears.  They are a little bigger, Colin.  Holy shit.  A little bigger.  They can't lose weight in your ears.  You can tell because your face is a little clumper, though.  That's what it is.  That's what it is.  Now your face is skinnier.  My face is skinnier.  That's like fucking tree rings to white people.  They have fucking giant. 
[01:42:30]  I'm sorry.  Very old ears.  Oh, shit.  And you got more hair.  What's that about?  What do you mean?  It's the same hair.  This weight loss does a lot of things.  It's less head.  Right.  Less head.  Because his head shrunk, so the hair would be closer together.  Now we know why Colin doesn't want to come around anymore.  I do pull-ups on my perfect pull-up bar.  Oh, I got the perfect pull-up.  Do you really?  Fits on any doorway.  It really does.  They weren't kidding.  It looks healthy.  It looks healthy weight loss, I'll be honest.  He looks healthy.  Oh, shut up.  Unlike what's-his-name.  He's doing the oldest comedy trick, trashing me beautifully, by the way. 
[01:43:00]  He looks healthy and then dead.  But he knows I love him.  You just gotta throw that in.  This is what Roast should be as opposed to the fucking Comedy Central roast of somebody  I've never met and don't give a fuck about him since he's being mean.  That's a new original idea.  Yeah, mean for no reason.  That's what Roast are, you asshole.  This is what Roast should be as opposed to these Comedy Central.  That's something you would say like seven years ago.  When they did the Chevy Chase roast, we roasted each other, you stupid ass. 
[01:43:30]  We had some good roasts on this show over the years.  We gotta get back doing that shit.  What's up, Colin?  Oh, can I please say on the ride in there, please?  What happened?  What did we do?  You did not give Anthony enough credit for that creepy shit he said.  It was the greatest creepy-  Oh, where he knew all the facts about-  No!  Where he said he wanted to lick on one-foot women.  I farted twice in the car. 
[01:44:00]  Little tiny women.  Dude, it's so fucking creepy.  We didn't know where to go with that, to be honest with you.  It's so amazingly creepy.  It is creepy.  It is a crazy woman.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I had this fantasy when I was a kid that there was a naked woman about this big and totally nude.  And, you know, with a little muff and little titties and everything, she was just a little tiny woman.  And she was alive, you know?  And I would take her and just lick her and, like, put her in my mouth and then, you know, I would feel her whole body in my mouth.  I would guarantee if they interviewed, like, a lot of serial killers, serial rapists, they would have a similar fantasy with everybody. 
[01:44:30]  I think so?  Yeah.  I would never, like, bite her head off or anything.  I just liked feeling her nudity, her boobies.  I related to this.  It's like, it made me-  I just pictured it.  I'm like, it's so fucking horribly creepy.  His woman was made of ice cream.  I completely acknowledge the creepiness of it.  I don't know what it means.  How could you not?  You could have been a serial killer, I'm thinking.  Because there was something else you said.  What was it?  Killing of little animals as a kid for a little while? 
[01:45:00]  Oh, I killed a salamander once in a horrible way, but I felt so bad about it.  And that's, like, I think, that crossroad of serial killer, regular guy, if you feel badly about it.  I think salamanders is the, lizards is the highest you can roll.  I rolled a tuna can lid over the top of him like a pizza cutter, and it actually went,  it made a sound as I cut him in half.  And I felt, like, shit.  Like, I felt this horrible- 
[01:45:30]  You never killed another person?  Like, death in the family feeling.  Like, I had this, no, I never killed anything.  I hunted, like, rabbit after that, but, you know, I hunted and ate it and shit like that.  But that was just blatant killing in a horrible way.  And, like, a serial killer would have gone like, wow, I would have gotten, like, a rod and fucking excited.  Yeah, if he got a rod, he would have been, he'd be a serial killer now.  That's the crossroad right there.  But I know I've been here, I haven't been here in a long time, and it's inappropriate for me to say it,  but you almost probably felt something kinship to it, because you almost saw a lizard-like look to you. 
[01:46:00]  Yes, yes.  Thank you.  Let's just fucking get bigger headphones so you're like, dude, it doesn't hang out of them.  I know, they fit like a fucking egg sandwich, your headphones.  They fit in his ears like fucking iPod buds.  I don't like the fact that Stupid had the word iPod buds.  I've already figured out his dumb head.  I would have came up with that.  iPod buds.  Besides, you guys are behind Bob Kelly.  He was telling us, dude, you got elephant ears, dude.  For like eight years to say.  Dude, dude, dude. 
[01:46:30]  You got your coffee, your big ears.  Hey, you know what, dude?  You get older, your body changed.  We're living a good life.  Be grateful, boom.  You got your friends, you got your health, boom.  Dude, so what, Dan is humiliating me every night by making me go up first?  Bobby's brand new positivity does sick of me.  We hate it.  It is just, it's always, it's just.  He does it to all of us.  I hate that new fucking motivational speaker, Bob.  So he's trying to talk that shotgun barrel out of his mouth. 
[01:47:00]  Fucking raging.  You know what, dude?  Everyone's going to be sad.  They're going to miss you.  Bob should get the perfect pull-up bar and put a rope around it and a noose.  Fucking kick a stool out.  That's perfect.  The ultimate perfect pull-up.  We were just about ready to go to break here when these guys walked in.  So we're going to do that and then continue with Colin Quinn and Patrice O'Neal.  Colin's playing Carolines.  Nice. 
[01:47:30]  Tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-0-0-0, right?  Yes.  Or they changed their number?  They changed their number?  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100 is the number for Carolines.  What is this fucking number then?  I've never seen that number before.  Wait, hold on.  Because they know.  By the way, who made this sheet up?  Let's go, Jimmy.  Let's go.  What do you got?  They gave the back office number.  That would be Evan right here.  I don't think it's your fault.  I think it's Sam. 
[01:48:00]  It's somebody.  They gave the back office number with an extension.  I'd say to blame Sam.  You know what?  That is the back office number.  7-5-7-4-1-100.  Yeah, we all know that number.  We've been saying that for years.  And then Patrice O'Neal is going to be at Bananas Comedy Club in Hasbrook Heights tonight and tomorrow.  Tell that scumbag at Bananas to call me and use me.  I'm sick and tired of this bullshit.  You want me to bring your tape to Harlan?  It's becoming an embarrassment.  You're at Caroline's shit.  I'm at Bananas.  I'm not at Caroline's anymore.  No, you actually stand on stage with a batch of Bananas behind you. 
[01:48:30]  And you've got to talk about it.  And that fucker, it's real Bananas.  It's fucking Bananas.  The guy has to buy Bananas every weekend.  Bananas Comedy Club.  I know that.  Just Bananas.  But Harlan is a fucking nice guy for a Bananas Club kind of guy.  He's alright, man.  But he goes out and gets Bananas.  He has real Bananas.  What does he do with the Bananas when they start rotting?  And he has something that I never...  This is why I know I've got to get something by soon.  I'm going to lose it. 
[01:49:00]  Is that he has one of those I-can-go-anywhere-traveling comedy club in a package  where it's the Bananas sign from the 80s and two speakers that he packs up and puts in a truck.  So if they throw him out of fucking the Holiday Inn, he can just go down to the charity.  And the headshots are on portable easels.  You can just set the easels up fucking anywhere.  Just the kind of shit that makes you think about fucking the early 90s.  It's like fucking boiler room fucking tactics. 
[01:49:30]  The guy's selling stock and then all of a sudden there's no phones in the office.  Can I just say, please?  Can we please...  I was going to call in and say, please don't talk about...  Is this going to be 30 minutes of conversation?  No, no, no, I promise.  I promise not.  I just want to say, don't talk about...  Don't talk about that fucking game until I get here.  Oh, we haven't.  I actually stopped Anthony today because I know he's ready to go off.  So let's do it after the break.  All right, cool.  We're going to do that.  Modern Warfare.  You've played it?  Holy shit.  All right, let's get into it.  I know.  Tell me about it. 
[01:50:00]  Holy fuckballs.  Really?  I think I'm even buying it.  I had to Twitter it like the second I turned it off.  All right, let's stop.  Everything I look at is blurry because my eyes are burning.  Right after the break.  They're fucking burning.  We'll get right into it.  This is going to be like 40 minutes.  I feel it.  I feel it coming.  That'll be good.  You got the new Atari?  Oh, my God.  Good break, Travis.  Jesus.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  You have seven new voice messages. 
[01:50:30]  First voice message.  Yeah, this F.U. goes out to Jeff.  Jeff, you're a fucking bitch.  You first get really upset the fact that I got two beautiful twins hanging out with me,  and you think I took advantage of them, but I didn't.  And then you come back home, and you fucking kick me out of the kickball team.  And then you take away my football ticket, and then you just basically tell everybody  how much of a dick I am.  Fuck you, you fucking cunt.  Next message. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, I'd like to give a big fuck you to my company, who's nice enough to give me a 2.5%  raise, and then charge me 3.5% more for health insurance.  Fuck you.  I got a raise and lost money.  Next message.  I just want to send out a big fuck you to my ex-boyfriend.  He always told me I couldn't get a fucking tattoo when we were dating, and now he's going  out with a girl that looks like a fucking bathroom on the New Jersey Turnpike.  Thanks, asshole.  Fuck you.  Next message. 
[01:51:30]  I want to send a big fuck you to my friend Colin.  He fucking came to my house after a night of drinking, passed out on my couch, and wouldn't  fucking stop snoring.  Fuck you, Colin.  I had to get up to work at 6 in the morning, and I got zero sleep, you fucking fuck.  Next message.  I want to leave a big fuck you to this short, fat, hemorrhoid of a lady I had to deal with  today. 
[01:52:00]  She had the nerve to call me negligent when she doesn't have shit for brains.  Stupid ass fucking idiot bitch.  Fuck you.  Next message.  Fuck you goes out to the fucking meter maids up here in Portland, Maine.  I work for a goddamn courier service, you fuck.  You know we're just delivering packages.  I hope you go home and get eight.  Fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big ass dude to my ex-girlfriend, who decided to send an email 
[01:52:30]  to my current girlfriend, telling her a whole bunch of bullshit about how I keep sleeping  with her, and how I keep cheating on my girlfriend, and I wish that psychotic bitch  would just die.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line, 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you, and goodbye.  All right, we got a full house today.  Patrice O'Neill will be at Bananas Comedy Club in Hasbrook Heights, New Jersey, tonight  and tomorrow.  And then our old friend, Colin Quinn, who has pretty much blown us off for the last year. 
[01:53:00]  Yes, he has.  He's going to be at Caroline's tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  And I'm fighting the urge to take this fucking peanut butter and smash Patrice's hat in.  How good that fucking hat would look caved in with this peanut butter?  I told him in the elevator, it reminds me of the 1980s.  It's like one of those victory tour hats.  You don't even like the Atlanta Braves.  I don't get that.  Black people don't like any of the sports teams.  It's just the hat.  It just matched my underwear strap.  All right, listen, Modern Warfare. 
[01:53:30]  I didn't forget.  Let's get into this.  I don't know much about it, obviously.  I know it's set in all sorts of records.  I don't know what you have on it.  The thing I have on it is that I thought it was the greatest game I ever played, the first  version, the greatest one-person shooter.  I think it's far beyond Halo.  Far beyond any other.  I play one Wolfenstein.  I need my first-person shooter fix.  I love those.  That's all I do is love those.  So I play Wolfenstein.  I mean, a real big...  But this game finally comes out. 
[01:54:00]  They got it.  I go get it.  I don't go online.  Fuck all of that horse shit.  The story mode, the second part of the story made me turn the game off and question my  morality.  What?  What was that about?  The second part of the game.  And if nobody wants to fucking hear it, I've got to say it so you can turn the radio off.  All right, hold on.  Give him a second.  Come back in like 30 seconds if you don't want a spoiler.  A spoiler.  Most people get it for the multiplayer. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, I understand that.  30 seconds is decreased.  It's going to be...  What was I thinking?  You know what?  Go somewhere else for the rest of the day.  Three minutes.  Three minutes.  I'm trying three minutes.  Oh, yeah, right.  Go to fucking Lithium or somewhere else for the rest of the day.  The game starts out by saying there is a warning.  We warn you.  There are disturbing...  There are some things that are very disturbing on this video.  You can set the disturbing things to be shut off.  I go all in.  Of course.  You're all in. 
[01:55:00]  You've got to go all in.  Any adult man is all fucking in.  Matter of fact, when you buy this game, for some reason, you have to give them your ID.  It's just...  You know, you're like, what the fuck is going on?  Well, they're giving all those names to the army.  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking cocks.  But...  So I get to the game.  I'm playing the first thing.  It's fantastic.  You have to climb a mountain with the fucking thing.  And you have to do it correctly.  Like, right button, left button, right button.  If you don't, you fall, you die.  It's fucking not fucking around.  And it's so violent, it's not fun. 
[01:55:30]  Like, so when you shoot the guys, you got to duck.  So you can't enjoy gameplay shooting where you shoot the guy and you're like, oh, that was cool.  There's another fucker, like, you're just indicating you're getting shot and you're turning red on the right, red on top, red on the back.  Yeah.  You're just dying.  And you only get shot twice before...  It ain't video game shot.  It's real shot.  So you get shot twice.  You got to go hide to get healed. 
[01:56:00]  It's not fun.  So I get to the second level.  First level's fun.  Snowmobiles, all type of shit.  Second level, it's dark, right?  And you just hear guys talking Russian.  Fucking right.  It goes...  The title of the scene is called No Russian.  An elevator opens.  You walk off, you're in the airport with three other motherfuckers.  And he goes, remember, no Russian. 
[01:56:30]  Start walking, they start murdering everybody at the fucking airport.  You're an undercover agent.  If you try to shoot them, they go traitor and shoot and kill you.  You don't have to shoot the people, but you can't stop them from shooting.  They shoot women, children, and fucking everybody at the fucking airport.  And here's the thing.  It's not video game.  They walk slow and murderous. 
[01:57:00]  You can't run.  They walk slowly through the...  And it's a real fucking airport.  It's the duty free.  It's the McDonald's.  And they murdering everybody at the fucking airport.  I'm sitting there going, I didn't shoot anybody.  I didn't hear feeling all bad.  Just like a black man.  I didn't shoot anybody.  I didn't do a scene out there.  I didn't do nothing.  I couldn't...  I couldn't...  It took me a minute to go, what the fuck? 
[01:57:30]  Wow.  It disturbed me to that level.  And now I'm at this level where it's a mall, a strip mall, with McDonald's and this and that.  It's so hard.  It's not fun.  It's so difficult.  It's very difficult to get through the single player.  The game is un-fucking-believable, dude.  And I'm playing it on pussy-ass normal.  Like easy?  Yeah.  I don't play easy.  I play normal because I play these games, but...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've heard about the airport sequence from somebody else.  And they say, yeah, it's brutal. 
[01:58:00]  You're just...  They're murdering people at the airport.  Yeah.  Wow.  Some guy's crawling like, no, please.  Oh, God.  I don't shoot him.  I try to go over and push...  I think X is, hey, hide under this chair.  Cocksucker behind me goes...  He just...  He shoots the guy who's begging for his life or crawling around to try to live.  Boom.  Boom.  Brutal.  That's the disturbance.  And I didn't...  That's far too.  And they're screaming and running and crying.  Dude, imagine a packed airport and motherfucking five guys...  Fuck that. 
[01:58:30]  ...dressed to the...  Like those guys that robbed that bank in L.A. years ago?  Yeah, yeah.  Those guys just walking through the airport and murdering their...  There's blood all over the place, right?  Let me...  Just smeared blood on the floors.  Dude, let me...  It's not bullshit.  Let me go to Anthony on the phone before we get to Anthony's comments on this.  Anthony, go ahead.  Yeah, what's up, boys?  Hey.  What's up, Patrice?  Hey.  That boy that...  The boy that Patrice is talking about, man, I got the chills coming out of that elevator  when I just started unloading on everybody.  Women and children, bodies dropping everywhere. 
[01:59:00]  It's crazy.  That's sick.  It's totally crazy.  That's some sick shit.  And I'm playing last night, and this kid, he's like, he's an American kid.  He's talking in like an English accent, making a joke, actually, in an Australian accent.  And he's talking, and he's going, yeah, just, you know, and then he goes, oh, nice.  And I'm like, oh, my God, in here, too?  I've heard quite a few...  I've heard a lot of those online as I'm playing the game. 
[01:59:30]  Really?  I know.  Oh, my God.  And then I get these kids just making fun of me because I suck.  These kids are telling me...  Oh, you're doing online.  Totally different than what Patrice is doing, obviously.  Now, I play with a computer and keyboard and a mouse most of my first-person shooters.  Really?  This, yeah.  Now I'm console with the Xbox.  I'm not very good with the console controls yet.  I'm getting better.  Every minute I play, I'm getting better, but I'm not...  These guys are getting fucking, you know, 25 kills at a clip.  So I go through, and these kids are taunting me going, hey, Noodles, Noodles, why don't 
[02:00:00]  you just take the game back?  You wasted your money.  You wasted your fucking money.  You suck so bad.  And then I, like, shoot at somebody and miss, and they kill me, and they're like, ah, you  couldn't even hit the guy.  You got the first shot, faggot.  You're a faggot, Noodles.  And I'm sitting there, they got me so mad and riled up, I got to the point where I'm  like, I have a lot of money, and I fucked 18-year-olds, and fuck you.  I believe them.  And it's just, I'm so angry. 
[02:00:30]  You took the what you make a year route?  Yes.  On the children?  I have to say, I make a lot of money, I have a great house, and I have girlfriends your age,  so fuck you.  They forced me to make an ass of myself.  That's why I don't play online, because I like to be immersed at the level that I like  to be immersed at.  Yeah.  I don't like this, I, why do you do that?  I don't know, but you got the little headset on, so you're talking to them.  You're fucking talking, going, yeah.  So you're just threatening some little children? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Fuck your mother.  And I was telling them that, like, uh.  Were you telling them there's no Santa?  I said, I was calling their fathers homosexuals, and, uh, uh, wishing horrible womanly diseases  on their mother.  And they were just laughing at you.  Yeah.  Because they made an old man upset online.  They did.  They did.  You did nothing to hurt these kids.  They're just, they're still laughing at you.  No, no, they were making fun of the fact that I couldn't play as good as them, and I  was like, who cares?  But you know who cared?  Me.  I care.  I care a lot.  We got one of those fuckers on the line here.  John.  No way. 
[02:01:30]  John.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  Ed, you suck.  I played against you.  And you were like, three for fifteen at some scale.  Yes, I fucking said I, but I, I said I sucked.  I was on there saying, yes, I suck.  Wait, let him continue.  Good job.  My name, my name is your mom's ass.  Of course it is.  Yeah.  And I just remember just watching you run across the screen while I'm sniping you from  like a million miles away.  Yeah, I, first of all, I just don't understand how I get fucking nailed so much while I'm running. 
[02:02:00]  Everyone else is running to the fucking HQ and shit like that.  You gave out your fucking name, so everybody, that's, that's gotta, that's gotta be cool  for them to kill Anthony from opening Anthony.  No, it's, it's, it's.  He doesn't even take friend requests either, cause he's so cool, his thing is, is full.  Hey, ass fuck.  I have, I have, I have too many fucking friends on there already.  I have to delete some in order to add some.  He has too many fake friends already.  I have, I have too many.  But John said, John, you said you killed Anthony and then you all made fun of him? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, yeah, we all, well, not me.  I knew who you were, so I was talking shit.  And then, but there was like, there's 10 year old kids on there.  You know, and they're brutal because you don't want to hear a little high pitched voice fucking  calling you a faggot, but.  Faggot, faggot.  I couldn't even tell if they were boys or girls.  They're like, you're just a faggot.  And then you'd hear like off, off the mic.  Okay, mom.  Yeah, you fucking faggot.  That's great.  Let's go to Kevin in Houston.  Everybody wants to.  Dropping in bombs too, like crazy. 
[02:03:00]  These little kids.  Oh, they are?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, fuck you, you nigga.  And that's where you bonded.  Yeah, you gotta take that back about your mother and being rich.  All right, Kevin in Houston.  Kevin.  Hey.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Patrice, I just wanted to let you know, I never thought that I would agree with you.  But I absolutely agree with you with this game.  It is unbelievable.  About morals?  You've never agreed with me ever in your life?  Like he's just anti-me and he hates that he agrees with the fact that I didn't want to murder people when I got off the airport elevator? 
[02:03:30]  The fuck is wrong with these people?  It's a fucking, the way they did it.  The way they did it.  The airport thing, right?  I usually in games will shoot a thing.  They have you, you shoot dogs, like you have to shoot a dog.  Yeah, yeah, they're coming at you.  They're just barking and you just, and you have to shoot them because they let, the dogs let people know you're coming.  You hear a little.  So you gotta shoot a dog, but it's like a silencer and get them out of there.  Yeah.  And it's, the airport scene, and it's probably more scenes like this, but the airport scene is, the way they do it, it's so real. 
[02:04:00]  And it's so, it's so scary.  Because you're like, man, if this happened, it's so, because the way the guys move, it's so, it's just methodical.  They walk too, so slow that you go, what the fuck, man?  Get me past this, but it's a, it's a, it's a board.  You have the option to join in and, and shoot, but you didn't. 
[02:04:30]  Shoot, I, I, I haven't shot one person.  What are you doing?  They buy the game and doesn't shoot anybody.  He takes off his shoes and goes to security.  Because you're a, you're a undercover, you're Donnie Brasco on this, on this board.  Uh-huh.  So it's like, you know, Donnie Brasco, he's like, he, he was sawing the bodies, but he wasn't killing that scene where, where Sonny Black and, it's like, you're not supposed to do that shit, but he's undercover, so he couldn't, he couldn't, you sick? 
[02:05:00]  No.  He put some peanut butter on your wound?  Yeah, right.  Fuck his wound.  So, it, it, the way they did it, you gotta just play the, you have to, you gotta see how they did it.  It's so methodical.  It's so murderous.  Let me, let me go to the phones.  Matt in Connecticut, Matt.  I gotta play that level now.  Hey, Matt.  Hey, I don't know what happened to you guys, but I was playing last night in some free-for-all tournament, and all of a sudden, I blinked, and my eyes were burning, and I realized I hadn't blinked in, like, 15 minutes.  Oh, shit. 
[02:05:30]  It made you forget how to blink, this game, huh?  Jesus Christ.  I've been there with some of these video games.  You just stare at the screen.  You don't want to blink.  You're so intent.  It's an unbelievable game, man.  Let's go to Coke Logic.  Coke Logic.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I've been playing Call of Duty for so long last night, I actually told the call screener the wrong information.  It didn't sell $4.7 million worth of copies.  It sold 4.7 million copies in a 24-hour period.  Yeah, 4.7 million copies. 
[02:06:00]  That's obviously the record, right?  It's now the highest.  Nah, not a record.  It is.  I think Halo is broke.  Halo is Grand Theft Auto 4.  Yeah.  Really?  It broke that record.  It has to be the record.  It's the number one fucking debut.  It's fucking phenomenal.  Almost 5 million copies in 24 hours.  Underwater submarines.  It's just...  I've got to play as a single player for a little bit.  Why do you not do that?  I'm so into multiplayer leveling up and it's that fucking like, I've got to get to the next level.  That's that dragon.  I've got to make Sargent.  That's that dragon slayer world.  That's that world of...  I'm going to... 
[02:06:30]  What's that game where you make a character and it takes you?  Dungeons and Dragons.  Everclass.  Everclass.  That shit is...  I would play it your way, I think, Patrice, before.  Yeah, like even...  And then maybe eventually go online.  Like Madden?  I don't play Madden no more because it's too real.  These niggas run like fucking Thomas Jones actually runs.  Like, who the...  What's the...  This shit is...  You get better weapons as you get up in rank and shit like that.  No, that's the good thing.  Like, I like that.  This ain't like a video game where you get... 
[02:07:00]  You getting...  This one's like, oh shit, there's a bazooka laying in there.  You shot a guy that shot a bazooka.  Yeah.  You picked a bazooka.  There's no, like, hey, next time I go over here, I get an AK.  It's like, you got everything because that's what you...  Whatever the bad guy's got, you pick up.  Can you play it on PlayStation 3?  Yeah.  I think so.  Yeah, I think I'm going to get this.  Hey, JD in Tampa, what's up?  There we go.  Yeah, hey, Patrice.  I will admit, the first time that airport map came up, I was kind of in shock. 
[02:07:30]  But you got to lean into it, man.  Play it again and again.  Oh, no.  Trust me, I'm going to shoot the people in the airport.  Trust me, the airport people, I'm going to shoot a couple of women that's running around.  Listen, the last time I played that map, I even hung back about 30 feet and I was just  walking around finishing off.  Finishing off people.  That's...  Screaming for help.  Do you hear what he said?  That's what I'm saying, the moral problem is, that shit could teach you how to be cold-blooded,  man, where this person has their hand up like this, like, please don't, and you go, I'm 
[02:08:00]  going to just do it.  And you're like, bam.  And the way they die, the physics of the body kind of flops down.  It's real, right?  Yeah.  I got to go to Elliot.  He's an army guy from San Antonio.  Elliot.  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Hey, brother.  Hey, uh, yeah, dude, I've been to Iraq and I've seen some sick shit, man, and I'm going  to tell you right now, I played that level and I was damn near about to puke.  I was just like, what the fuck is going on here?  The airport thing again, huh? 
[02:08:30]  Wait until the news gets a hold of it.  And what, let me ask you, I haven't figured it out yet.  I'm amazed they're not on it yet.  Can I ask him what, the thing, I'm going to ask you what bothered you, what bothered  me wasn't the actual shooting of the people, it was how real they made it, the way things  were moving, the people were moving, the people, it wasn't the gore, it was the way  they executed it.  They've gotten really good at that, like it used to be, all right, they're just little  computer people, they don't look real, they don't die real, now it's, uh, where's Danny? 
[02:09:00]  There's got to be a YouTube clip of that already.  That's what I was, yeah.  There's got to be.  So what was his, what's the thing, that's what bothered him too, like the way they did  it, the way it seemed?  Yeah, hell yeah, what bothered you, being an army guy?  I mean, the way, I, when it first started, you know, Patricia was saying how they were  talking and stuff, the way they smoothly walked out of that elevator all nonchalant with  fucking body armor and the weapons and everything, and they just kind of creeped up on everybody 
[02:09:30]  and just started going off.  I was like, okay.  Like, I didn't know what, I didn't know what to do.  I was just kind of looking around.  My wife looked at me like, are you okay?  I'm like, uh.  Are you okay?  Holy, if you're playing a game and someone's got to ask you, are you okay?  Dude, they ask you, they ask you, do you want to, there's disturbing shit.  They don't say what it is.  Somebody was on the phone and said, there's an option to actually skip that level.  Yes, any of those levels.  Wow, really?  Yeah, where you could go, they ask you, you really want to do this?  Is the sound up?  Oh, we got it? 
[02:10:00]  Hey, Elliot, thank you.  We're going to move on.  I appreciate it.  Elliot from the army.  Danny, there is a YouTube clip if you guys want to check it out.  Airport Mission.  It's a Call of Duty, Modern Warfare.  People are actually asking what game we're talking about.  Here we go.  Badass.  Out of the elevator.  Oh, yeah, look at their faces.  This is the airport.  Oh, these people don't know what's going to happen.  Oh, my God. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, that's cold-blooded.  All this is making me do is want to buy this fucking game.  Holy shit.  Look at them.  Look at these guys, man.  You can watch this for yourself, obviously, on YouTube.  What the fuck?  Oh, my God. 
[02:11:00]  This guy's calling.  He's done.  Yeah, very methodical.  Up the stairs.  Go.  That opening fucking...  Just look at those people.  They wiped out...  Like 50 people right off the bat.  Now, can you go away from these guys if you want to?  No.  You got to follow these guys.  God damn.  Yeah, like a Starbucks and a Jamba Juice. 
[02:11:30]  God's race.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Like you said, how they're falling and stuff.  Yeah, nice to be in the airport to go to pull this off.  You think planes are still taking off?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh.  Looks like an airport.  Oh, the security just bought it. 
[02:12:00]  The graphics are sick.  Yeah.  Look at the way they're walking.  Yeah.  That's how a terrorist walks.  God damn it.  People like trying to surrender.  I don't like the fact that you can't just walk into the store if you want to.  What, are you going to bite something?  This guy's got to go to pistols.  Oh, there you go.  That is some sick shit. 
[02:12:30]  Jesus.  How long does this...  Exactly.  It's a massacre.  It just keeps going and going as they go to the airport.  You get part of a fucking massacre.  Oh, the poor guy in the elevator.  The clip's not even half over.  Other guys are shooting, too.  What if you want to shoot everybody?  Well, you've got to...  It's a team effort with those other guys.  Wow.  And now they did their carnage and now the police come, which is what they wanted to happen  so they could fight the police.  Now you're fighting people with other guns. 
[02:13:00]  It is.  Wow.  Jesus, Patrice.  That opening fucking elevator and then just looking at the people waiting online, that  carnage is sick.  Well, Ant, they are on it already.  Charlie in Jersey.  What do you got, Charlie?  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, Charlie.  A couple days ago, I hope you were just asking about whether or not the news was going to  jump on this and actually Fox did a story.  I think it was on Fox and Friends.  He interviewed two people talking about it.  Cool.  Yeah.  It's pretty fucking graphic. 
[02:13:30]  That is, man.  Someone's saying there's a husband looking at his dead wife crying during the airport  scene.  Oh, shit.  I find that hard to believe.  If you really look at the people, you see some of that shit going on.  Colin, comment?  Well, I just like the fact that they spend millions of dollars to make every detail totally  realistic and then they make the terrorists rushing.  Very goddamn Colin Quinn. 
[02:14:00]  That's why Colin's here.  Oh, my God.  To keep it real.  What's with this country?  You want to hear everybody on what's going on?  He's biting his finger.  And he should.  He's very angry.  It's a very good point.  You are so right.  They should be Muslims.  The bad guys are Russians.  They should be Islamic terrorists.  Maybe they're supposed to be Chesnians.  They split the difference.  Ah, Chesnians.  Yes.  Ah, there you go.  Wow, this guy's blowing off his grenade launcher at these motherfuckers.  Oh, bye-bye.  Wow.  Is that what...  Oh!  That flew. 
[02:14:30]  Why can't you walk onto the plane if you want and shoot people on the plane?  You can.  They can.  Yeah, you can get on the plane.  Don't give them any ideas.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  Yeah, you can get on the plane.  He goes, oh, yeah, that's true.  Colin, you don't play video games?  Nope.  What was the last game you played?  Do you remember?  Uh, Ms. Pac-Man.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, I was a little violent.  Eating those little ghosts.  Ha, ha, ha.  Uh, wow.  You've never done studies on us.  So was that bullshit, though?  No.  That's crazy, right?  I think you overhyped it a little bit.  It wasn't that goddamn great.  Let's go. 
[02:15:00]  I saw you leaning in, looking scared.  I was leaning in, but I was hoping to see, like, somebody up close.  And now you're desensitized.  What about that bloodbath in the beginning?  I'm desensitized from Ms. Pac-Man.  Patricia, when are you going to beat the game?  Estimate.  He uses cheat codes.  What?  No, there's none.  There is none for those fucking games.  Well, I ask because Josh is on the phone, but how long is it going to take you?  Um, if I play it straight, it would take me three days.  Three days?  Like, three eight-hour plays.  All right. 
[02:15:30]  Eight-hour sessions, yeah.  But probably I'll finish it next week because I wanted to go slow.  I wouldn't want it to end.  All right.  Well, we got Josh in North Carolina.  Josh?  Yeah, my 11-year-old beat it in the day.  And he didn't even mention how bad that was at the airport scene.  I asked him how it was when I came home from work.  And he said, oh, it's cool.  His one-year-old?  Your 11-year-old?  Your 11-year-old.  Oh, 11-year-old.  The 11-year-old did it in one day.  The whole fucking day.  I believe these kids are amazing at this shit.  They grow up so fast.  This is cool.  And now they pull him in and, uh... 
[02:16:00]  And he didn't mention the airport scene?  Why didn't you shoot him?  Well, there was one...  They didn't stick around.  Another father said, my son went through the airport level and he was laughing the whole fucking time.  Because I think that type of shit.  Like, when I was younger, I could watch a beheading like it was fun.  Like, uh, Faces of Death was my favorite show.  Now I cannot...  I can't watch that shit.  Remember that graphic guy?  Oh, the graphic guy.  The African graphic guy.  Cut it.  Why?  Faces of Death.  That's all fake, by the way.  All fake.  Faces of Death.  Faces of Death.  All fake. 
[02:16:30]  That guy wasn't even a corner.  Michael B. Gross is an actor.  You didn't believe this photo.  I watched it.  It's not...  It's all fake, you fucking believe.  Shut up.  I watched it.  You said it three.  It was real.  Exactly.  It's not...  They're in the middle of an African...  There might be one or two real clips, but it's bummed.  Faces of Death was fucking real.  They set up millions of dollars to set up this outdoor African, like, you know, genocide.  The guy picks up the guy by his cock and just slices it off.  Occasionally there are real things, but you're acting like a movie wouldn't have spent any money to get some extras.  Yeah.  It's a fucking movie.  This is not...  Watch the cutaway from the guy when the alligators eat the guy.  The crocodile's killing the guy. 
[02:17:00]  They cut away and then come back.  Watch the camera work.  It's all fake, you fucking...  I don't even know where you can get a copy of it these days.  You think where they cut the monkey's head off and then ate his brains was real?  Yes.  No.  It's not.  Why is there a camera under the monkey?  Watch it.  That's disturbing.  Watch it now.  It's not real.  Watch it now and you'll go like...  You can tell.  It's badly acted.  Now it's obvious.  The cuts that are made...  I don't think so, man.  You've never seen it in a while.  I don't know.  It's not real.  That screaming monkey?  I watched it recently.  That bothers me like a fucking...  Dude.  Are you saying baby seals are fucking...  You will know now that you have some sense. 
[02:17:30]  You will know that that's fake.  It's poorly acted.  It's obvious that it's fake.  The producer is one of the guys actually in the blood orgy.  Yes.  He's the producer.  He's one of the guys in the blood...  He plays like the leader of the blood orgy gang.  The whole thing's a fucking goof.  Yeah.  What do you call this?  A goof also?  Very salty.  A little belly dance.  Yeah, girl.  Belly dance.  There's a belly dancer because they're in this restaurant, of course, where they're going  to eat monkey brains.  And then they're at a table.  Okay.  Hundreds of years old. 
[02:18:00]  From the moment patrons enter these premises, they are treated like...  He's a great narrator, but this movie stinks.  The welcoming music and finger chimes of a belly dancer mark the beginning of this most  unusual dining adventure.  Stay left there.  They're all sitting at the square table.  But do you understand?  This is the problem with YouTube and everything else.  Is the fact that we were told about one thing.  I was always like that since I was 11.  There's a face of death and now we're on to face of death.  We'll go back to it.  They had the mallets.  Yeah, they need to be reassured.  All right.  Feeling that the foreigners were comfortable with the waiters' signal for the hot specialty. 
[02:18:30]  This looks like a fun night, no matter what the result is.  Yeah.  Belly dance with some monkey brains.  Look at all the cutaways.  A lot of laughs.  This looks like a fucking movie.  This looks like decadent Europeans enjoying a monkey brain.  Of course.  Now comes...  Oh, look at the little fella.  He's fine.  He's fine.  He's acting.  It's not real.  Watch.  They cut away.  The waiter presented the men with their tools of destruction.  Tools of destruction.  Little hammers.  And watch.  You never see this monkey get hit on the head.  Never.  You never see anything. 
[02:19:00]  There's a camera under the table that...  It's fake.  Oh, my God.  This reminds me...  Patrice, can I have your Kevin Hart's number?  Oh, shit.  Now, watch.  The camera's under the table.  The animal was now ready to become the main dish.  Now, he doesn't look like he's enjoying that.  There's a little monkey spinning around.  This is bringing back bad memories of my life.  Watch.  It looks like Kevin on Soul Plane.  Watch.  The little monkey.  Now, watch.  Here's a few simple instructions at the men at the table.  Here's the monkey.  That's the way to do it.  If you were going to do it, that would be the way to do it, right? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, you'd film it right there.  Watch.  Now, look.  Okay, I bash his head in.  How is this fun?  No, watch.  Watch.  They don't hit him.  Watch the weak hit.  Oh, you won't even say it.  Look.  Ah, we've been rickrolled.  God damn it.  We got rickrolled.  We got rickrolled.  We got rickrolled.  We got rickrolled.  Motherfucker.  Oh, so the Rick Astley video came out right when they were going to come from on the head.  Some motherfucker.  That's great. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, we got fucking rickrolled.  Oh, no.  Getting rickrolled.  Fucking rickrolled.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Oh, do we suck.  I love getting rickrolled.  We got fucking rickrolled.  Wrong.  Right at the moment of truth.  Right when you said watch.  We're analyzing this like it's a Bruder film and we get fucking rickrolled.  Who would build that table?  That's a real monkey killing table.  It's a movie.  For the movie.  It's a prop.  That's for the movie.  It could be for an umbrella thing.  It's a bunch of bored millionaires trying to kill monkeys. 
[02:20:30]  I believe it.  It's fake.  You never see them hit the monkey on the head.  Now, is this official that it was fake?  It was official or this is just so?  The guy is an actor.  Michael Gross is an actor.  The, uh, Francis B. Gross.  What about the guy that cuts the guy's cock over in the middle of the genocide?  There might be one or two real clips.  There's a few, like, real news clips in there.  Yeah, they probably just didn't have enough clips so they made up all the other shit to  make a movie.  You're not allowed to show snuff films.  It's illegal to market that in video stores, you silly goose.  This was genocide.  Quiet.  Genocide.  Boy, did we get fucking rickrolled.  Although I will show you where some real beheadings are. 
[02:21:00]  Hey, Colin, did you shoot a movie over the summer?  Sure, with Sandler and all those guys I did.  Fucking A.  I was going all goddamn summer.  Who'd you play?  And the best part was, I was up in, uh, outside in Boston.  Yeah.  I was staying at the Mandarin Oriental, like the fanciest hotel in Boston, and in the  middle of my summer of luxury and decadence and enjoyment with big stars like Chris and  Adam, these two low-end fools were at the Danvers Sheridan for two weeks shooting a Brendan  Frazier movie.  That's not a big deal.  It's going to be as big as that monkey brain fucking thing. 
[02:21:30]  The name of the movie is, that name of the movie is fucking rickrolled, probably.  Oh, goddamn.  Two losers at the Danvers Sheridan, I was begging, and the one of them that were up there, I  was going to go back to New York.  I swear to God, I had a whole plan to go over there and fucking get David Spade to drive  over in like a fucking nice, you know, expensive limo and shit and just watch, oh, but it didn't  work out because they left when I was there.  You got a big part of the movie?  Yeah, pretty big.  Pretty big.  Fuck it.  Who do you play?  Who's your character?  Why's it coming out?  My character is, uh, a guy like, they're all these guys that come back to the small town. 
[02:22:00]  He kidnapped David Wayans.  Oh.  I didn't write one line yet.  Colin Coyle and Celtic's Bride.  Oh, fuck.  Okay.  The, uh, my character is a guy, they're all these guys that come back to this town for  like that big chill reunion.  And then I play a local guy who's bitter and blames Sandler for my failures in life because  he's a big success because of some basketball game.  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  So it was an offer, not an audition.  Based on facts.  Yeah.  Based on facts.  Get Colin from remote control.  Right.  The man with a character's Colin Quinn in the movie.  Yeah.  I play an aging man who's bent on suicide.  Sandler used to come out of remote control at once a week.  You'd see him pop his face out for a bit.  Here you go.  Colin was on it all the time.  Monkey Brains has a different version of it.  Different version.  The Brains is they don't hit him.  Watch the little weak hit.  No, he doesn't even, you don't even say, they cut away.  They cut away.  Look.  Don't worry. 
[02:23:00]  Look, look at how fake this is.  This is documentary footage.  Look, see, look.  Now you don't see the monkey's head.  It's not real.  There's no monkey.  They're not hitting him.  Yeah, if it's faces like that.  They're not hitting the monkey.  They would really show the destruction of the monkey.  Do they want to show the hand with the mallet going one mile an hour?  A lot of documentaries are cut away footage from ten different people.  That's a fake head now.  Of course it is.  It's smaller than the other monkey head.  That's different color.  Why are they all upset? 
[02:23:30]  Fucking Curious George.  Oh, that's real.  No.  It might be a real dead monkey, but it's not one that's close to the video.  Oh, that's real.  No, how do you know what a cut open monkey head looks like?  That might be a real dead animal, but it's not a monkey.  Oh, come on.  That might be a real monkey brain, but it's not a fucking one.  They did not just kill that monkey.  It's a different monkey.  That's a real monkey.  It's the same one.  It's different.  It's the same one.  I can tell.  It's fake.  The only difference is now he's that smile and he's frowning.  And his brains will be eaten. 
[02:24:00]  A hell of a lot more than that, too.  And how much monkey brain could you get out of here?  And look, his face isn't bruised up.  I want to see Rick Leslie again.  That little soft shot.  I'll tell you where I agree now.  There was a scene of one of the millionaires making a,  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He wouldn't do that.  You're there to enjoy your dead bird monkey head.  Show the crocodile eating.  I can never find that one.  These are a bunch of decadent millionaires.  Fucking Barry Manilow.  Barry Manilow loves fucking monkey brains.  He's enjoying his monkey brains.  What about the guy cutting the cock off in the genocide? 
[02:24:30]  Hey, by the way, Face of Death is listed on Snopes.  Let's go to Snopes.  Of course.  Okay, go to the genocide.  Colin's obsessed with that dumb scene.  And I guarantee it's fucking, it's probably Yopat Kodos in it.  We got it.  I think we got it.  Face of Death, victim of Pol Pot genocide.  That's Asian.  Oh, we can't get rid of it.  That was Cambodia, can we?  Rwanda genocide scene?  Yes.  Face of Death?  Let's do that fucking fake scene.  There we go.  Nothing fake about it. 
[02:25:00]  It certainly is.  The only thing fake and phony is your personality.  Language.  Language.  Language.  Language.  Language.  Language.  Language.  Language.  Language.  I got him good with that one.  He certainly did.  He silenced me.  He didn't really have a comeback for that one, Colin.  What to say?  I wasn't expecting to go there.  Is it illegal to say you saw a Snuff film?  Because I've never seen one before.  No, you can say anything.  Yeah, I know.  Have you ever seen one before?  I think I saw.  I've seen many.  I've seen many Snuff films, actually.  I brought in a video once.  Colin Snuff?  I destroyed it.  No, no, no, no.  But I've seen many. 
[02:25:30]  No, I've seen.  I consider Snuff like a.  I showed Ant once.  I had a friend that collected a lot of sick shit.  Oh, yeah.  And there's one where there's this guy on a bed, and this woman is naked, and she's taking  his.  He's sitting on a couch.  Was he sitting on a couch?  He's sitting on a couch naked.  Okay.  And it's zoomed in on his balls and cock, and she's like just tugging at his limp little  cock.  And then all of a sudden, she takes his balls and starts twisting.  Like a doorknob.  Round and round.  Round and round and round.  Once.  Twice. 
[02:26:00]  Three.  Not a twitch.  Four.  Five.  Keeps going.  Just keeps twisting in the same direction.  And they get all red and like blue.  Right.  And then the camera pans out, and the fucking guy has to be dead.  He's dead.  He's dead.  It's a corpse.  She's fucking.  No doubt in my mind.  The guy's not moving whatsoever, and he has just this look on his face like, uh.  I think that was in a funeral home.  They were like having some fun.  They grabbed a guy and decided to do shit like that.  Snuff.  I know what you're going to say.  Snuff film is somebody that's hired to act in a movie. 
[02:26:30]  They bring them somewhere, and without them knowing, kill them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not like watching, you know, Arba Dwyer blow his brains out.  Something like that.  That's, you know.  Yeah.  I mean, I always consider Snuff being a, to be a porn film where somebody gets killed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  It's a true murder caught on film, you know.  Well, that's, uh.  Like beheadings.  That's a lot of fun.  Well, those are technically probably snuff films.  Technically.  No.  But it's got to have a sexual element.  People buy them.  Rich.  That's true.  Decadent men buy them. 
[02:27:00]  I watched a movie with Nicolas Cage.  Yes.  Eight millimeter.  Can we take a break so we can leak and shit?  Is that all right with everybody?  Yeah, I got to pay.  Now we're all just looking at the computer trying to find Colin's awful genocide scene.  Yeah, we'll find that out.  I guarantee you it's fake.  No.  Yeah.  Fake code.  I guarantee you it's fucking not real.  No.  Your awful perception.  They cut the guy's car golf.  Enough.  Fucking gullible idiot.  After the break, guy calls.  I saw up.  A house can float with balloons.  Fucking creep. 
[02:27:30]  Uh-oh.  This one's bad, too.  This is not it.  This is not it.  Oh, boy.  Tell me this is fake, all right?  That's it.  Oh, this is not real.  By the way, if it was on Ogrish, it's probably real because Ogrish is probably very real.  I used to go to fucking Ogrish.com and Rotten.com.  When I was younger, I can't watch none of it anymore.  I can give you the most vial website.  I think I'm getting too close to death is so real now.  When I was younger, it was funny.  That stays with you, that stuff.  Yeah, I don't want to go there. 
[02:28:00]  I can't even go to sites where they have a lot of candy on it.  When I was thinking about my fucking diabetes, when I see Snickers commercials, I go, what  the fuck is going on?  Here it is.  Congo War.  Here it is.  This is it?  From face of death.  In DRC, there's currently a war.  Congo War 2.  That's not it.  Congo War 2.  Look at those skinny legs.  It's skinny than mine.  Is this hit, Colin, or no?  No, of course it is.  Of course it can't.  Colin, will you please tell us where to find it?  It's not it.  Danny, look at face of death.  This is a death. 
[02:28:30]  Three.  The only thing I ever saw in face of death that I believe was footage from a subway,  it might be three or four, where there was a guy pinned between the subway and the tracks.  Yeah, they have accidents.  And that was real footage from the news, because the guy was actually pinned between the trains.  I've seen much better ones.  I'll show you a guy cut in half, if you want to see it.  No.  All right.  Thank you, no.  I'm telling you, man.  They had some stuff, but not enough for a movie.  Kenny sent us a nice little fucking, nice little email yesterday.  Not anymore.  With somebody that hit, I guess, the back end of what? 
[02:29:00]  A track, oh, the front of a tractor trailer.  Someone was texting.  And it completely made the impression of the front of the tractor trailer in the vehicle.  Like a 90 degree angle was just squished in by the driver's compartment.  You know what?  And then the last picture was the person.  And they were cut in half.  Yeah, it was disgusting.  It was an iPhone, and their fucking thing didn't send.  That fucking texting while you're driving shit, I'm going to tell you, dude, it's addicting.  And it's worse than drunk driving.  And I have to admit, and it's fucking, I have to throw my phone in the back now so I don't do it. 
[02:29:30]  So you don't do it.  You know what the worst part of it is?  We talk about this.  Like, you'll see if you can get a whole word in without looking up.  And not as a game.  You just want to get your text done.  And you do this one, too.  Yeah, you hold it up.  You try to do it, like, in the safe way, but it's just...  You realize you're weaved out of your lane and you're fucking jam on the brakes.  There's got to be so many accidents.  And it's the fault of pedestrians who think they have the right-of-way. 
[02:30:00]  And they don't understand that I'm not paying attention to the road sometimes.  Yeah, don't stand up.  Don't step in front of my moving vehicle.  Yeah, don't fucking just think I see you, motherfucker.  You got to be careful.  Manhattan, first of all, you don't have the right-of-fucking-way.  If that thing says red, don't walk shit, you know, don't fucking walk.  And if there's traffic where I have to stop before I enter the intersection,  but I still have a green light, don't fucking walk in front of me.  Because the second it clears out in front of me, I'm going.  And now you're in front of my car, you're fucking me up. 
[02:30:30]  I hate that.  They all start crossing.  Well, how about the guy that crosses because he's got enough room?  I'm coming up to the intersection.  He crosses against the light.  And another person behind him isn't even looking just as a sheep, follows him.  Bam!  Oh, I lay on the horn, and I keep gassing it towards him.  And then jam on the brakes.  I just love looking at that face like, oh, I'm going to be hit.  Everyone's just staring at you.  Fuck him!  No, I mean, everyone in the studio is just staring at you.  I'm absolutely on his side. 
[02:31:00]  I'm just listening to him run down these cocksuckers.  Everyone's just staring at his screens.  How about the woman that leads with her baby carriage?  That is because I've seen that many times.  You will never dare.  It's like, I'm going to kill your baby, and I'm going to be fucked up for the rest of  my life.  Bitch.  Or I've seen people cross where there's a truck blocking the view.  They'll cross when the light is just turning green for traffic to go, thinking, you know,  I'm already in the crosswalk, so people are going to stop for me. 
[02:31:30]  And meanwhile, the person next to the semi can't see them crossing in front.  It's a blind spot.  What, Jimmy?  What's the matter?  No, I'm enjoying this.  I hate pedestrians.  He's insane.  But it's just, you're a man.  It's like, we've all, we all agree, but it's just the way you're...  At one time, this motherfucker in Cleveland, he didn't look this way.  I'm telling you, he walked across the street.  I get very impassioned about driving.  I'm the same.  I'm, like, so on your side.  It's just pedestrians not thinking that people should... 
[02:32:00]  I have the ride away.  Yeah.  It's like, you're out of your mind.  This ain't California where people stop and wave you on.  I hate that.  Give pedestrians the ride away.  Like, in any situation, they have the fucking ride away.  If they step into a crosswalk, it doesn't matter what the fuck it is, where you are, you've  got to stop in California.  Like, you'll be dead.  This, the fucking arrogance is death.  Yeah.  Like, come on, man.  One out of three people killed in traffic accidents are pedestrians in New York City.  Faces of death.  How about the little fat lady that tried to beat the train across the tracks? 
[02:32:30]  Well, that's real.  And got hit and...  That might have been actual...  And flew and hit the camera.  I keep telling you, they've got real footage.  They just didn't have enough, so they had to fucking spice it up and all that fake shit.  I don't think you recognize any real footage in it.  Maybe one or two.  Right.  The original almost has none.  They wish they had more stuff, because it was before video cameras, before we're all filming  all this shit.  We're going to break.  The plane crash, where all the bodies roll, that's like real news footage.  Sure.  Colin Quinn, Carolines, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, 22-757-4100.  Patrice O'Neill, Bananas Comedy Club, Hasbrook Heights, tonight and tomorrow. 
[02:33:00]  And anyway, let's just send Danny a link to that video Colin was, and anybody has it.  I'm sure they're trying already.  When we get back, a guy calls 911 to jerk off.  It's a great story.  We'll do it next.  Stay there.  I'm calling back to Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Come on, Colin.  Do it live.  Do it live, Colin.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  I haven't been to this on MTV.  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  Man, I don't think so.  Colin Quinn's going to be at Caroline's Friday.  That's tonight, Saturday, and Sunday. 
[02:33:30]  There you go, Colin.  A little promotion for you.  What did you say, Caroline's?  Caroline's.  I said that.  I said Sunday.  You're going to sell them all out?  And breaking news, Colin Quinn wants a purple light.  We've got to discuss this a little bit on the show.  I was with you until the purple light.  Why not?  We have a problem with the pedestrians trying to cross the street as we're trying to make  our right turns here in Manhattan.  And I was agreeing with Colin.  The system is fucked up.  And then Colin goes, we need a purple light.  A fourth light, a purple light.  A pedestrian purple light.  Or a purple light for the cars making a right turn. 
[02:34:00]  Because I had to listen to these suburban drones hammering away at the poor pedestrians.  And I was like, you know what?  New York is kind of a pedestrian city.  It really is.  Do what I do.  Ride the fucking train and ride the fucking bus.  You ride the bus?  No, stop it.  You're a big star.  I ride the bus and the train every day.  You don't ride a bus.  You're a fucking bag lady.  What's wrong with you?  You live here.  Show us your bus pass.  It's not a bus pass.  It's a metro card, you silly goose.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I don't know because I don't ride the buses.  I do the cabs and the subway, but not a bus.  I won't take a bus.  You just work on a bus, too.  What happened to the other day? 
[02:34:30]  I was watching online, and there was an incident where the show ended early, and I saw my girl  stalker Patty was in here.  Oh.  What happened that day in a train?  I think that was a tranny.  I think that was a tranny.  Oh, that was a Sidney Cain.  Yeah, that was a tranny.  Management got scared and just got there.  Of Sandy, was Twato making an ugly appearance? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  They got their nose into our fucking business.  Yeah, we wanted Patty to blow Bobo.  I don't know.  Something was going to happen.  Spit on his dick.  Patty was going to do it?  No.  She touched it.  No one was going to do it in the end because they were all creeped out by Bobo's penis.  Bobo's penis is atrocious.  But management doesn't understand how this shit works.  They should just stay down the fucking hall and let us do our thing.  It's like a pig snout.  Yeah.  His penis looks like a pig snout.  It does.  It's horrible.  It's not a good dick.  Hey, we got a guy calling 911 to jerk off.  You want to hear this?  Oh, yeah.  Why?  I don't know why.  That's a very good question. 
[02:35:30]  Does he just do it until he can't answer his name?  He needed a fucking live fucking voice.  He figured out the operator was good enough.  Call 911.  You got a nice butt?  Huh?  Tell me your name.  Maybe we can talk more, but if you don't tell me your name, I'm hanging out.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I hear you.  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  Are you in pain, sir? 
[02:36:00]  What's your emergency?  What a creep.  What a great idea.  What the fuck? 
[02:36:30]  He's just...  He's just watching.  She's not saying anything.  I guess just him knowing she's listening.  What the hell is that?  Was that the load? 
[02:37:00]  That was the load, I think.  All right.  That's it, really.  It's quick, but...  He just jerks off to nobody talking on the other end.  I thought maybe she would, you know...  And she let it stay on, too.  I'm sure they got it.  To get evidence.  Got his number.  Yeah.  He got arrested, Edgar.  I think it's evidence that Steve's doing a shabby job producing this motherfucker.  What?  I don't think we need any evidence.  That's not breaking news, my friend.  Let's go to Boston.  A very good observation coming in from Boston.  What's up, Boston?  Hey, boys. 
[02:37:30]  Hey.  Hi, Opie.  Hey.  I was just curious.  I was interested because Patrice was all upset about shooting people in an airport in  a video game, but he's totally ready to run down a pregnant woman and her frickin' baby  at a crosswalk.  No, I'm not ready to run her down.  I mean, you know...  That was stupid of the woman to put her stroller out first.  That's propaganda, what you're saying.  I said they come out.  I hate when women stick their babies out.  I didn't say I want to hit them.  That is pretty sick.  And then I didn't say they was pregnant.  This guy just couldn't...  He's fuckin' it all up. 
[02:38:00]  He completely Glenn Beckman.  He did fuck you over over there.  Huh.  Jesus.  Gotta appreciate Glenn Beck, though, don't you?  He's a raving lunatic.  I do like him, man.  And Lou Dobbs couldn't take it no more.  He got the fuck out of here.  He's out of the game.  He fuckin' said fuck all that bullshit.  This fuckin' news war.  It does fuck with your...  It fucks with your soul if you got one.  Well, I got some inside info on Lou Dobbs.  Should we go with it?  That he's...  He's starting a radio career.  How do you know?  Because Black Earl called me and said,  I have an opportunity to work for Lou Dobbs' radio show. 
[02:38:30]  But we don't know...  Doesn't he have a radio show?  I don't know.  He only does, I think.  He has one here.  Where?  On SiriusXM?  Because you never know what to believe with Black Earl.  He's the one wiping boogers under your fuckin' console.  Oh, Jesus.  Let's get back into that.  People are wiping boogers under the console?  Fuck.  The other day it was rubber cement.  No.  Fuck no, it wasn't.  Well, there was a big controversy on Ron and Fez.  They did, like, a whole crime scene investigation.  Really?  To see where it came from.  And apparently it was Dave, Eastside Dave. 
[02:39:00]  Not Fezzy?  Because it ended up over there, too.  Well, Fezzy sits here, so that's the only reason I thought it was Fezzy.  Dave's fuckin' herpy boogers.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was fuckin' not right.  Yeah.  All right.  That's disgusting.  It's fuckin' disgusting.  Bobo's here.  Bobo's here.  Okay, good.  You've met Bobo before, haven't you?  I don't think so.  Oh, wow.  I love when Colin meets new people that have been friends of the show.  Colin's a movie star.  He doesn't need to meet Bobo anymore.  Well, he...  Colin was a big fan of Retard Laverne and Shirley.  I still love them.  Big fan of Stalker Patty. 
[02:39:30]  I still say one of the funniest things of all time was you bringing them at the time when  the video music was like the hippest game in town.  And they brought those two.  Oh, Jesus.  Just step all over Colin.  Here we go.  You guys...  You...  You, you need to be more funny, you.  Scott...  Scott here looks like he's just taking a shit in space.  I'll be honest with you.  As sick as you may be, I certainly haven't exactly been on fire today.  He's got a good point. 
[02:40:00]  I can't argue with you.  The barging guy just gets a call and he comes in.  What?  Are you doing a Colin Quinn impression?  No, I'm just barging guy.  Oh, you're barging guy.  Here, I barge in.  I get a call.  I barge in.  Get a call.  I get...  I get a...  I get a call.  Abortionguyservice.com.  I like that.  My teeth hurt.  I like barging guy.  That's not a bad idea. 
[02:40:30]  You like the character?  Yeah.  Get a call by bargingguyservice.com.  I just...  I just walk in.  I assume.  You walk in and start yelling.  Little Jimmy Norton.  I just walked in and they called...  I just got called in and do a bar...  Just barge it on a Formula One race.  Somewhere in San Juan ago.  I just walked in there and stand right in front of those cars.  He's stepping all over the college.  Barging guy.  They just drive right by me.  And somehow they know it.  Those drivers just know it. 
[02:41:00]  I think barging guy's supposed to step all over everything.  I've never hated Jimmy more than this moment.  The brainchild of James Norton.  Barging guy.  You are a douchebag.  I fucking hate you.  It's kind of an interesting character, though.  As a matter of fact, I just got to call the bargain on a UFC event.  I wish you did.  Right hook to your face.  Should we have Bobo go outside the studio and come up with another character that is his own? 
[02:41:30]  I thought barging guy was good.  I thought barging guy was good.  He barged in.  Bobo, we're going to continue the show.  Some adults are going to talk.  You go outside the studio.  And when you have a new character, you raise your hand and then we'll...  Can I give him a character?  Or just come in when you've got the character.  Colin, can I give him a new one?  Yeah, sure.  Oh, fuck.  Okay, go outside with Colin.  And...  Oh, no.  Colin.  Colin.  Fucking...  Bobo. 
[02:42:00]  All right, I want to take bets.  Bobo.  He's going to be racist guy.  I know it.  I know it.  Fucking hilarious, man.  He's hysterical.  Knowing Colin, he's coming in as racist guy.  He wants to take...  I'll take some fucking bets right now.  Colin can't hear us, right?  No way.  No.  What do you think his character's going to be?  I don't know.  I thought it was going to be somebody to harass me.  Let's see.  Going back to you?  I bet you there's going to be something.  All right, so...  Yeah, it's got to be something.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  The racist guy is really funny, though.  Yeah, me...  Norton!  No, it's got to be...  Fucking Bobo. 
[02:42:30]  I'm like, getting a good voice.  Fucking hilarious.  He's just...  I walked up to him out there.  I'm like, well, all right.  Hope wants to know what's your character.  He goes, what do you mean?  I'm like, the new character you were told to work on.  He's like, you've got to fucking work on a character.  With the voice.  What's the voice?  He goes, I...  I'm like, all right, just walk in.  Just be barging, guy.  Jesus.  Make up a voice.  He's like, okay, how is that?  I'm like, perfect.  Yeah, perfect.  That's perfect.  It doesn't matter what he said.  Colin is having a tough time telling him who his character is.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Because Bobo...  He's giving him a lot of direction.  I guess Colin's hard to understand, too. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, well, you know...  Did Bobo end up working with Joe?  He did, I think, yes.  Again, you said Joe, and I was thinking, who?  Yeah, exactly.  All right, Colin's back in studio.  Regular Joe.  All right, so let's get back into this here.  So Colin's at Caroline's.  You've got fucking Patrice at Bananas County Club in Hasbrook Heights, Friday and Saturday,  tonight and tomorrow.  Everybody's here to ask me about Boston.  I'll just say a chickpea in Boston the night after and the two nights after Thanksgiving.  Everybody wants to know.  Everybody.  Every single fucking person. 
[02:43:30]  That's a night after Thanksgiving?  That's chickpea.  That's a spring-through mess for Thanksgiving.  Two and a half hours from Boston.  Yes, I know.  That's a Chinese restaurant in Chickpea.  Yes.  Colin, are we inviting Bobo in?  How does this work?  I don't know how you set up your character.  Bobo!  Wait, Bobo has something.  Bobo's coming in.  Bobo just raised his hand.  Bobo...  Oh, go back and look for another Cracker Jack box where you get your license.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, please. 
[02:44:00]  I'm mad at pedestrians.  No, you're the mad pedestrians.  I'm the mad pedestrians, guys.  No, you're the mad pedestrian.  I'm the mad pedestrian, guys.  I can't...  The mad pedestrian.  I mean, we're going to guys turn an hour trip into my...  to Smithtown into a four-hour trip.  No, no.  You're the pedestrian.  You're not the driver.  You're complaining now that it's taking four hours to drive somewhere.  You did it totally wrong.  You're the pedestrian.  Oh, sorry.  I heard it different.  You blithering boy. 
[02:44:30]  It was still a good time.  Where did you get your license?  You know...  Hey, can't you see the frickin' light?  That's it.  If you see the frickin' light, that light is red.  You don't...  You're not...  If you don't follow that, your face will turn red.  Thank you.  Go on.  That's good.  Ha, ha, ha.  Bobo, he beat that at you, too, for no reason.  Oh, yeah.  I'm gonna...  I'm gonna...  I'm gonna have to report you.  You're gonna have to do some serious green there. 
[02:45:00]  That a boy.  I like it.  Hey, Bobo, who are you...  Like, you're doing the Meisner technique.  Who are you looking at?  Yeah, yeah.  You're turning your head, looking at...  I'm trying...  I'm trying to imagine...  Be pissed off at the...  At the guy...  At the guy right next to me.  Oh, right, right, right.  Okay.  Fair enough.  But you're a pedestrian.  Yeah.  You're probably crossing, and the car's probably headed this way.  Why would you stand there, turn your head to the left at a 90-degree angle,  and yell at somebody?  Exactly.  When you're a pedestrian, you could just turn your body.  But it's that turn of the, uh...  When they were turning on the right...  On the green light? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  But he could turn his body.  I don't know what this Smithdown thing came in.  I know.  Oh, he's driving out to fucking Suffolk County.  I know.  I messed up the role.  I thought you said...  That's a long walk, by the way.  I thought you said mad at pedestrian.  Manhattan to fucking...  No, you're mad at the driver.  Right.  Oh, you're talking about me mad at the driver.  Okay, wait a minute.  Take a deep breath and get into character of pedestrian mad at the driver.  Here it is.  You're stepping off the crosswalk, right?  And, uh, a driver comes up, and he wants to make a turn, and he cuts right in front  of you, and turns in front of you, and almost hits you with his, uh, SUV mirror. 
[02:46:00]  Excuse me, sir!  Don't you know you're not there?  No right turn on red!  I can't believe you!  No, no, no, no.  Hey, dummy.  I have a green light.  You have a go.  See, we're parallel to each other.  That's fucking...  I want to make a right...  That's too difficult.  I want to make a right-hand turn.  You're being too...  Yes.  That's...  Are you fucking...  You're talking to Bobo!  So, this has to be factual.  You have no patience.  There's no continuity to this scene.  Bobo, you almost get hit by a car that ran a yellow light. 
[02:46:30]  And you was crossing the street.  Yes, yes.  But I didn't run a red light.  The vroom machine almost hits you.  The vroom machine almost hits you.  What the heck are you blind?  Can't you freaking see him trying to cross me?  The turn, turn, turn, move, move.  I'm trying to cross right now.  You can't see me crossing?  Oh, hey, microphone.  Yeah, exactly.  You're very lucky.  You can't freaking see me crossing?  Is that SUV so tall you can't freaking see me?  Good point.  But he actually...  They are tall.  He keeps driving, though.  That was a comment on...  Yeah.  Hey, can't you freaking see... 
[02:47:00]  Are you drunk or something?  Oh, let me bring out my breathalyzer.  Why would you have a breathalyzer,  an angry pedestrian guy?  I don't know.  I'm just saying hypothetically.  Oh, see?  There you go, fucking...  There you go, fucking cocksucker.  He shut me right the fuck up.  Exactly.  It's figurative.  He's just saying hypothetically.  Does anyone else have a character for Bobo?  Patrice?  Hmm.  Trying to think.  How about...  Well, no, no.  You've got to do it outside the studio.  We've got to try to figure this shit out.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's the best part. 
[02:47:30]  Don't say who you are.  All right, Jimmy said...  We have to guess your character.  Right, Jimmy.  Remember that, Bobo.  Don't come in and say,  I'm this guy, guy.  Yeah.  You've got to ruin it.  Bobo is fucking genius.  Now, I guess Jimmy is giving him another character.  Look at Colin.  Colin's just...  Colin is disgusted with this.  Not in a disgusting way,  just disgusted.  I was disgusted.  I couldn't...  I was trying to think of a better character.  A better character.  Get it in here.  I liked angry pedestrian guys.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Bobo?  Bobo's coming back in.  Bobo?  Bobo! 
[02:48:00]  Is he not come in, guy?  Oh, no.  Shut up.  Don't say who you are.  Go ahead.  Hey, Opie, I got a microphone in my pants.  I want to suck a microphone in your pants.  I got some money.  That's the worst interpretation.  He was supposed to just come in and tell Opie he wanted to suck his cock.  Are you kidding?  I'm like, you're a gay guy.  Just hit on everybody.  Tell Opie he wanted to suck his cock. 
[02:48:30]  Why would you say something about a microphone?  No, no, because Opie's...  Double entendre.  Yeah.  Double entendre.  All right.  It went over the heads.  All right.  Patrice has got one.  It was a deca entendre.  I didn't get it at all.  It was horrendous.  All right.  Patrice is out there coaching young Bobo into a new character.  So when he comes in, you will hear Bobo as a character.  And then we have to guess.  You play along at home.  Try to guess.  Yeah.  What character Bobo is portraying when he comes in. 
[02:49:00]  All right.  Patrice is working.  Yeah.  Patrice is...  Yeah.  Patrice tends to over-explain.  He'll be out there for 10 minutes.  Really?  You think?  It's like, shouldn't it just be quick?  You're this guy.  And then he's got to think about the material himself.  Yeah.  But...  Patrice just likes having an audience.  He's just going to talk to Bobo for the rest of the hour.  Yeah, exactly.  He's out there.  Bobo's going to be this next stupid barbecue.  Oh, here we go.  Patrice.  He's walking back in.  Patrice is back in.  Bobo's here.  He's getting on mic. 
[02:49:30]  All right.  Here's Bobo.  All right.  A brand new character.  We don't know who it is.  Let's see if we can guess.  I had to take out of my busy schedule.  Why the heck is everybody pissed off at me?  Steve C?  No, they pissed off at me.  I get every white guy complaint calling my number.  White guy's calling his number.  Oh, my God.  What happens?  What happens in the translation?  I get e...  Patrice is very annoying.  I get e-mails all the time. 
[02:50:00]  From white guys.  Yeah, they're all free.  They're all free to me.  I got it.  I know who it is.  I know who it is, too.  All free to me.  I get mail addresses, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  Oh, my God.  And it's death threats.  Wow.  You're Keith Robinson.  You're Keith Robinson.  Yeah.  No, Keith Robinson does not live there.  That's not his address.  Oh, it's not.  Oh, really?  We thought it was.  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 
[02:50:30]  You should obviously know what address that is.  Jesus fucking Christ.  And I'm sure they're going to know yours, too.  Way to go, Patrice.  He should have just said, it rhymes with Papak Floflama, you fucking asshole.  He just said 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  Well, where is that?  He pulls out some fucking genius shit.  He goes, hey, ass face.  It was hypothetical.  Yeah.  Then he goes, 16 Pennsylvania Avenue because you guys don't get the fucking fact that I'm  the president.  Bunch of boobs.  Yeah. 
[02:51:00]  Because he gets e-mails.  Who are you supposed to date him?  You're going to hate me.  They say, hey, you, why don't you change your, why don't you change your attitude toward  me?  I'm freaking down on my, I'm down on my luck here and you want to tax my ass off?  Who's Anthony Barnes?  That's Anthony.  That's my guess.  It's Barack Obama.  Well, I don't know.  Barack Obama?  Yeah.  But why would you be down on your life?  He's going to have his ass taxed.  No, no, I said the guy, I said, I said.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[02:51:30]  What?  No, I'm saying I got.  What?  No, I got, no, I got, I got, I got, I got a message, I got a letter from someone complaining  about being down on my luck.  Oh, it was a letter?  Yeah, complaining that I want, complaining, saying I want, and do you see how he's sticking  out of his stately chest?  He has a stately chest and he's defending his point.  You're lying.  I don't lie, I'm not lying.  See, he tries to do his own voice now.  The online is done.  His hook stinks.  Yeah.  I like it. 
[02:52:00]  All right, Bobo.  Let's get him out of here.  Bobo, Bobo.  We'll bring him back for another character in a little while.  Yeah, try to pick up one of your own and just come in.  Oh, why would he do that?  That was pretty good.  Don't be Bargin Guy again, though.  Brother Wheeze is outside the studio.  Where's the Wheeze man?  Oh, yes.  I saw him.  Do you think Bargin Guy was a good character?  What?  I like Bargin.  You like Brother Wheeze?  Have you been on Brother Wheeze's show?  Oh, no.  An inductee?  Wheeze.  There he is.  Are you intimidated?  There he is.  He just got into the Radio Hall of Fame last night.  You know Patrice O'Neill? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  You know Colin Quinn?  Patrici.  You might not remember.  He was on once with me.  You might have been with me.  We were in Montreal.  Okay, yeah, for the Comedy Festival.  Go ahead and leave.  No, I don't remember.  Which one?  You want to go?  No, no, no.  He said he's good.  We were just getting into some Obama stuff, I guess.  I don't even know.  Obama.  Yeah, Bobo was trying to be Obama and we couldn't figure it out.  Well, I went to dinner with Wheeze last night.  It was very interesting.  You're sort of losing a little faith in the Obama man, right? 
[02:53:00]  Hold on.  The deal is, you see, of course I've lost a lot of faith in Obama.  I'm a bleeding heart liberal.  I campaign for Obama.  I will fight for Obama.  But what I told people before the election even happened, ugly conservatives.  You know, teabaggers and these 912 morons that might be in the room right now, I don't even know.  But these kind of people, I will fight till the end, bro.  Even though Barack Obama isn't delivering for the liberals. 
[02:53:30]  The truth of the matter is Barack Obama isn't even a liberal.  So, we've lost faith.  Of course, he's a socialist.  But the reason I will fight against him is because the people that fight against Barack Obama,  that think all these ridiculous things that he isn't, like a liberal and a socialist,  those are words that the right uses to scare the idiots.  Socialists.  We should be so lucky to be socialists.  Get lucky.  Why?  Yeah.  Why be lucky to be socialist, though?  Well, first of all, you don't have to worry about it because I'm pretty sure you've got deep pockets. 
[02:54:00]  Exactly.  But let me tell you something.  The American system of capitalism gave me the opportunity to do that.  Why should I then have to dish out what I earned to help bring people up as Obama?  Well, first of all, that wouldn't be not a brotherly or a Jesus type thing to do.  No, no, no.  I'm taking that out of it.  But no, I already am, by the way, because I'm taxed up the fucking ass.  Whoa, I forgot where I was.  I don't get to do fuck radio.  Yeah, that's fun.  But you're not taxed as much as when there was a one-time 90% tax on rich people in a very, very, not that long ago. 
[02:54:30]  There was also black and white drinking fountains, so, you know.  Exactly.  You know, you're called the good old days.  By the way, I like that.  But you know who changed that about the black and white drinking fountains?  Liberals, my brother.  Liberals were on the right side of every single argument.  Were is a great word you use there.  When did it change?  Both parties have changed over the years, you know.  But I think it changed somewhere in the 70s, 80s.  Liberal became something more than just social causes. 
[02:55:00]  It became this intrusion into America's life of too much government.  And it's left us, I don't know.  When they became the language police.  When they became the repressive language police that they always hated in the conservatives.  It was more humanitarian.  It was more humanitarian.  And now labels take the humanity out of everything.  Liberals aren't what they...  Liberals are what people used to be just like do the right thing. 
[02:55:30]  That's why people who supposedly voted for Obama this past thing...  This is where I was upset about this whole thing is that I want to see the white people that...  Dead?  No.  Oh, sorry.  I just assumed.  I want to see the white people.  My thing where...  You know how it's easy to be gay now.  Meaning, back in the day a gay guy...  But like, I'm looking at Brother Weezer's hands.  His tattoos.  Those are tattoos you can tell before tattoos...  Before a bitch had her little flower on her ankle and shit. 
[02:56:00]  So what I'm saying is, I would have loved to meet the white people or have a historical base of white people who were those helping the cause before it was cool to fucking be...  Right.  Helping the cause.  To be a good white person.  Right.  So what I'm saying is, before it was a human thing.  Now, being a liberal is easy.  Being a conservative is easy.  You just have to follow the fucking rule of what it is. 
[02:56:30]  It's all corny.  It's all fucking corny now.  It's not legitimate shit.  I think when you were that white person that was marching with blacks in Selma and stuff...  You were doing some shit.  Then you were making a statement.  Now it's like there's a bunch of followers and they can't even see who the leader is.  Some fucking 95-year-old dyke?  Can you imagine talking to a 95-year-old dyke?  What are you talking about?  We know.  I'm just saying a woman...  Like she went through some shit.  Right.  Who did something when it was dangerous. 
[02:57:00]  I met her at the speakeasy and we had to go to some city hotel to eat some bucks.  I just want to say something to Brother Anthony over there.  Yes, sir.  Because you see, this is the same crap I run into all the time.  When he started switching over about how liberals are a different situation now with the parties.  When I argue, I argue strictly liberal and conservative.  Okay.  Fuck the parties.  I don't want to know about Democrat and Republican because people bring up this crap about the Democrats were the right-wingers a bunch of years ago and it did switch over. 
[02:57:30]  I ain't talking about any of that.  Liberals are the people that got everything that we have now that we think is good, even to Medicare, Social Security, blacks and whites being able to get married, women being able to vote.  That's all liberal causes.  And the people, let me just finish this, the people that fought against that crap are conservatives.  You're Glenn Beck's and these cocksuckers getting people to run to Washington with Barack Obama painted up like Hitler and the Joker. 
[02:58:00]  Fucking assholes.  It was okay when Bush was painted like that?  Yeah, you know why?  Because you're full of shit, Anthony.  Bush was painted like that for two seconds.  They didn't have 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 people in Washington spurned on by radio assholes and that's where it all came from.  100%.  These people didn't show up on their own.  They were pushed.  And sure, two people thought Bush was Hitler.  Nowhere near it.  Two people.  It was so accepted to badmouth George Bush.  And believe me.  Where'd you hear it? 
[02:58:30]  Where'd you hear it?  For eight fucking years.  I'm asking you, where?  CNN.  Oh, fuck you.  MSNBC, NBC, CBS, everywhere but Fox, who is obviously biased.  Obviously?  I know.  I'm not arguing that point.  They just pulled a couple days ago.  That's how they do.  I'm higher rated than any of those other.  Big fucking deal.  I'm just saying.  Do you want to compare their ratings to the three you call the liberal?  Liberal TV, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox got a pimple, my brother.  A pimple.  That's because it's cable compared to it.  It's killing MSNBC and it kills CNN. 
[02:59:00]  Good for them.  Why?  Because it's the truth.  Because they're talking about what people want.  Bullshit.  They're idiots.  You can't deny that the media.  How about this black professor that just punched this white woman in the face?  I don't know about this shit.  Of course you don't know about it.  Because it's not in the papers.  I've been out of the loop.  It's not in the papers.  Well, you know about it somehow.  It was on NewYorkPost.com.  Covered it.  That's it.  Why didn't the New York Post put it?  Well, it's probably in the paper.  It's not in the paper.  It might have been for one day.  It's not in the New York Post?  No, it might have been in for one day.  But it's not in the daily news.  No.  You cannot deny that the media is overwhelmingly liberal and overwhelmingly liberal. 
[02:59:30]  Especially when dealing with race.  Let me ask you this.  If that's the truth, why do you think it is?  Is it there's a meeting somewhere?  I'll tell you where it is.  No, it's an unspoken thing.  It's an unspoken thing.  It is white elitism.  It is white elitism.  We don't want to deal with the fact that blacks are angry with white people because it somehow  makes them feel guilty.  It's white elitism.  That's exactly what it is.  That's what the liberal media is?  Yes.  The liberal media is worried about the black folk are pissing out and we don't want to admit it. 
[03:00:00]  They're the same ones.  That whole fucking thing.  They're the same ones.  That's a big issue.  They're the same ones that are afraid to put a black criminal in a commercial.  They're the same ones that are afraid to say the word black because they're afraid when  they say it.  The ugly way they feel about it is going to come out.  They're not afraid.  Of course they are.  Of course they are.  It's not about fear.  It's about fear.  Why would anybody...  Listen.  Why would the people who run the world be afraid of what they are?  It's afraid of an acknowledgement.  Because they want to deny what they are.  People don't want to admit that they're fucking living a white privileged life.  They don't want to acknowledge that.  So they gloss...  They're not afraid of being hurt, but they're afraid of the honest admission like, 
[03:00:30]  yeah, black people are fucking angry at us.  They want to just fucking gloss it over and pretend it doesn't exist.  So can I ask you why...  What is the catalyst for the anger with Obama?  Is it racial?  You mean on my side?  I don't want to see what you're saying.  Why do I think teabaggers don't like Obama?  Why do you think teabaggers, yes.  Well, you know, I don't want to get into this fight in here, but there's no doubt in my heart  that the people I saw at that 9-12...  And by the way, if anybody went to my little website, Weez.com, there's a video of these 
[03:01:00]  fucking morons talking about the czars, you know, because they learned from Glenn Beck,  who's a genius, that Barack Obama's got czars, and that's some scary socialist communist  shit.  These people were interviewed, bro.  Interviewed at the 9-12 teabagger moronic march.  And they were talking about these czars and stuff, and the person doing the interview  said, do you know what that is?  Listen, did you know Bush had czars?  Maybe more.  No, he didn't know that.  They don't know half of this bullcrap.  What they do know, sorry, my man, I do believe there's a ton of racism involved in here, because 
[03:01:30]  when this...  I'll tell you something real quick.  Give me a second.  Where I work, like where you work here, a bunch of radio stations, there's a conservative  talk show host two doors down.  I hate the motherfucker, you understand?  This guy's on the radio every day spewing what I believe is hate.  And when Barack Obama...  Wait, listen to this.  When Barack Obama became president, in three weeks, this dude put out Fubo t-shirts and  Fubo stickers.  Fuck you, Barack Obama. 
[03:02:00]  Check this out.  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  The arrogance of the left to think...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me...  To think that anybody who goes with conservatives or went to those tea parties was led and  pushed, whereas liberals...  There's a real intellectual arrogance with liberals.  And I want to know, where was the media attacks?  These are people who just don't want to pay higher taxes.  Where was the same mockery of the fucking Code Pink protesters or gay rights protesters  or illegal immigrant protesters?  Why should I mock gay rights protesters? 
[03:02:30]  I don't care.  Why should I mock that?  Doesn't it bother you, though, that the media would choose...  I think it's a good thing.  How could you say it's not a bias when the media would choose to just openly mock these  people who are protesting because they really just didn't want...  And they're having town hall meetings.  Like, the media was mocking them.  I don't want to talk about town hall meetings.  Let's talk...  Let me finish my rant.  Why is the media mocking them and not the other groups?  Because they're mockable.  The motherfuckers at that 9-12 thing were pushing...  I mean, you deny this fact.  Look, this comes from my heart.  I fight this because I bleed for people. 
[03:03:00]  Think whatever you want.  This is not a team I signed up for because I think it's cool.  We're the dickheads.  We're the ones...  In my city, there's zero liberal talk.  And you can hear Beck, Savage, Hannity, all this.  You understand?  So people don't even get to hear the shit I'm saying to you now.  And I don't do it on the radio, by the way.  People are probably turning your show off.  I was going to say, thanks for doing it on ours.  Why is there no liberal talkers?  In all honesty, they tried Air America.  They tried Air America.  You know radio better than any of us. 
[03:03:30]  It's built on fucking making money.  And if people aren't tuning in, if liberals are coming off as pompous and self-righteous and whiny,  people don't want to listen to that.  Here's the deal.  I told, I hate to say this, but I told Hillary Clinton to her face when Air America was on, with Al Franken.  And by the way, I hate that Randy Rhoads broad.  I mean, I'm a huge liberal looking for a champion.  I can't stand the broad.  This Lynn Samuels is probably a friend of your guys, is on the one liberal channel right now on Sirius. 
[03:04:00]  And she hates Barack Obama, so the liberals freak out.  But when you say, is your question, why do we mock the teabaggers?  What's a distinct question?  How can you deny the bias of the media when you look at the way they handle those protests,  and when you look at the way they handle other protests, whether it's anything you want to name?  Let me quick ask you a question.  How did the media handle the teabaggers that you're pitching about?  It was constantly confronting them.  Calling them racist. 
[03:04:30]  Where did you see that?  Where did you see that?  CNN.  MSNBC.  Okay, those are two.  What else?  Every place I saw them.  No, you didn't see it on ABC, CBS, and NBC.  That's the part of the liberal media that you guys talk about.  It's bullshit.  They report news.  And if conservatives don't like the news, that's why Fox exists.  That's not true.  It's just not the truth.  I'm watching this media blackout.  I'm telling you, I'm watching, there's a media blackout on the fact that a black Columbia University professor 
[03:05:00]  punched his white female co-worker in the face while they were having an argument at a bar  about race and white privilege.  By the way, I did read it on my BlackBerry when it happened, but I'm sure it'll be out.  It's not.  Fox will put it out, and everybody will have it.  Why?  Imus.  Every network showed Imus every 30 seconds.  When there was a noose, a black female professor at Columbia University found a noose, which  is a symbol of black lynchings.  It was front page news in the Daily News.  Front page news for the Post. 
[03:05:30]  Fat Nick.  They beat up these three black...  The Post, front page news on the Post, the Post is a right-wing newspaper.  I understand that's all my Murdoch, but I'm saying, Fox is not even covering this one.  Why?  That's a great quote.  Why would they be covering it?  Because when it comes to race, they're all phony.  The Drug Report had it up, and it's gone.  All of them.  What's going on?  They didn't kill Jesse Jackson.  They showed Jesse Jackson's clip about Barack Obama.  I want to rip his balls off.  He's talking down to niggas.  They didn't show him, say he's talking down to niggas.  They could have killed Jesse Jackson with that, and they didn't.  Well, where'd you see it?  You might have seen it one time. 
[03:06:00]  When you see something one time...  I've seen CNN a few times.  Yeah.  It was not.  Come on.  They didn't play that the way they played Don Imus.  You know that.  Don't be stepping up with honesty.  They didn't kill them with it the way they killed fucking Imus with his joke.  Because for some reason, it is uncomfortable.  Can I say why, though?  It's...  When a white guy does something racial out in public, the...  I don't know, white meat or whatever you want to call it, they vilified him.  Like, they vilified Imus and they vilified Michael Richards to say, this is the lion shit. 
[03:06:30]  To say, here he is.  This is the motherfucker that's racist.  Yes.  Like I said, we all believe racism to exist.  I don't like talking about it no more because I can't find one.  Unless some white guy fucks up and says, nigga, by mistake, or Michael Richards goes on a rant, that's when I see a racist.  But I'm saying...  So they vilify him to go, there he is, it's not us. 
[03:07:00]  Exactly what I'm saying.  You're saying exactly what I am saying.  It's a bunch of white people spanking certain white people that are not dealing with race honestly because they're afraid of being exposed.  Policially correct people are not afraid of being misconstrued, they're afraid of being exposed as fucking racist.  Which was a ploy to remove...  Look, if white people can't have fun, nobody can.  It was a ploy to stop the word nigga.  It was a ploy to stop using the word nigga anywhere. 
[03:07:30]  If white people can't say nigga, nobody can say nigga.  White people can if they want to.  Black people can.  But they can't.  White people are punished by other white people.  That's where the N-word comes from.  Why is it this...  It's because white people can't say nigga.  Why are they not?  They cover black crimes.  The N-word.  I have to say fucking N-word.  They cover black crimes, but they don't show black on white crime as hate crime.  They won't show the racial component.  They show black on anything crime.  They won't show the racial component.  I don't know why they won't do it.  I don't want to be racial anymore about it. 
[03:08:00]  Because black people...  Here's where we fuck up.  Anytime somebody black fucks up, we have to defend...  It's like they group us all in to where you go,  Well, Patrice, gee whiz, niggas shot somebody at a gas station.  Black people are not allowed to go,  Fuck that motherfucker.  White people get to...  You get to vilify your villains.  We have to fucking defend Michael Vick somehow.  When I love those...  You don't have to defend him.  That's part of...  I know I don't. 
[03:08:30]  You know what I'm saying.  That's part of a black...  You know what I'm saying.  I don't have to, but that's the fucking rule.  Right.  The thing about the black...  Can you imagine if a white Columbia professor  had punched his black female co-worker in the face  during a racial argument?  I can't deny any of that,  but why do we got to be stuck up on just that?  Because I'm talking about the liberal bias of the media,  and you're saying it doesn't exist.  You said Fox isn't even doing it.  When it comes to that, nobody touches it.  Well, maybe it's not liberal and conservative.  That is a very, very liberal stand  that even Fox won't go near.  They had it on drugs, and they don't touch it. 
[03:09:00]  What's that?  It doesn't make any sense.  Why is it?  No, it doesn't make any sense.  The president had to have a fucking beer  with a cop because he said he was an asshole.  By the way, the second black intellectual  in a major institution to have a racial incident.  Well, he came out and called the guy an idiot,  the cop, right away.  But he says let's not rush to judgment  over the fucking terrorists that shot up the soldiers.  Because he gets pressed into having his fucking rule.  But he should have told that cop,  eat my ass, you are an idiot.  Because he's the president. 
[03:09:30]  That's some of the perks of being a president.  Maybe he should have shut his mouth over that  instead of his asshole buddy fucking crying to...  I'm sure he was on his fucking phone.  Hey, Barack, I got a cop in my house.  He's fucking with me.  You know, Barack should have kept his fucking mouth shut  until the facts came out.  Why...  Because I say that even at Fox,  they have the same racial discomfort that they do.  And the liberal media outlets have become...  The problem I have with liberals  is they've become the same thought police  that they always hated the conservatives for. 
[03:10:00]  They've become the same...  When were the conservatives of the thought police  so I can understand it?  When they were going after Lenny Bruce in the 50s  for criticizing the Catholic Church.  That's conservatives, right.  When they were going after a lot of people  for criticizing the church  or for criticizing the country,  you're considered a common...  I mean, for years and years,  the conservatives have been horrible.  But you're saying,  when did it turn against liberals?  And I think when they became the people they hated,  which was through the 70s  and up and through the 80s and now.  Well, I believe that I'm a fucking sick-ass,  bleeding-heart liberal,  and it's got nothing to do with politics per se, 
[03:10:30]  Democrats and Republicans,  and I'm never going to be any different.  And when I watch Fox or listen to Glenn Beck,  if I did it with you,  I could point out every hateful fucking lie.  That's all I'm telling you.  Why is it not hateful when Oprah is doing it?  I'm going to tell you why.  I'm going to tell you why.  Because it seems to me,  and this argument will go on forever,  and I'm fucking your show to death.  People hate this shit.  Shut up, I'm telling you.  People hate this shit.  I like this shit.  But listen,  why is it hateful?  Because it seems like,  for instance,  when Tiller was shot,  you know,  O'Reilly called Tiller,  Tiller the killer. 
[03:11:00]  He's the abortion doctor.  Right.  And, you know,  there's a,  first of all,  the guy got murdered.  And, you know,  there's a chance  that some friggin' hillbilly cocksucker  was watching O'Reilly every night  and goes,  I'm going to, you know,  I'm going to take one for the team.  And they went and murdered,  let me finish,  went and murdered  the friggin' abortion doctor  that was working under the law,  of your country, right?  That's exactly what I'm saying right here.  So how do liberals,  that's why it's hate, bro.  That's why.  Leads to murder.  It's the thinking,  maybe we made each other's point then,  because what I,  maybe you're saying that was hate,  but what I'm saying is 
[03:11:30]  that's the thinking  for other people stuff  that makes liberals so arrogant.  I don't care what it is, bro.  I'll tell you what,  maybe some cocksucker  will watch O'Reilly do that  and go and kill him.  Like, whereas,  like, a liberal will say,  I'm intelligent enough  to watch O'Reilly  and make the distinction,  but the average dumb American isn't.  That's the average.  But that's where the news  fucks up now  because the news  is supposed to be  telling us something  and then back off.  They're supposed to say,  Right.  that 3,000 people  got shot in Iraq  and then back off.  They go,  3,000 people got shot. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, shit.  Like, somebody goes,  has an opinion  about the news.  They editorialize, yes.  The news,  it doesn't exist anymore  where they just go,  even these cornball news shows  like in the morning,  there's like a girl going,  oh my goodness.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you think that's kind of  fucking shitty,  don't you think?  I got to address something  that we said  about hate speech  and people,  maybe some hillbilly  being influenced  or something like that.  Let's take a bleeding heart liberal  that looks at what you call  the teabaggers  and those protests  that were protesting 
[03:12:30]  higher taxes.  If you want to say that.  Well, I do want to say that.  That's bullshit.  It's complete fucking bullshit.  Well, okay,  and it's bullshit.  And now maybe  somebody's being labeled  as a racist  when they're not a racist  because of what liberals  are saying about them.  You're fucking putting labels  on people  because it's easier  than accepting the fact  that maybe they're just mad  at the way the government  is running.  Okay, can I ask you?  I am tired of paying  the bill  for every motherfucker  in this country.  But where the fuck  were these assholes 
[03:13:00]  when George Bush  was the president?  I didn't see no  goddamn teabaggers  flooding goddamn  Washington Sea  with pictures of what you said.  They were fucking...  That's the bull fucking shit.  A lot of anti-war protests  were going on  when George Bush showed up.  Oh, no, no.  I'm not saying they're bad.  Look, look.  Hey, I'm not saying it's bad,  but they were there.  Whenever George Bush  showed up at the UN,  there were fucking light.  The police had to come out  and drove  to keep the protests  away from there.  Can I comment, please?  Sure.  Those fucking protests  are so different  from their teabaggers. 
[03:13:30]  How is it different?  Let me...  I'm going to tell you.  Americans expressing  their disenchantment  with the government.  But go ahead.  I'm going to tell you  why they're so different.  Because those liberals,  which, by the way,  are far-left liberals,  those liberals  that show up  at the UN and stuff,  don't have some radio  and TV station  rallying them up to go.  They do it...  Wait, there's a big difference.  There's a big difference.  They are sincere  and maybe wrong.  But they show up  on their own.  But when you got  a fucking guy lying  about czars  and scaring people  with socialism... 
[03:14:00]  And, bro,  let me tell you something.  I know you guys  are intelligent,  but that socialism shit  is just a knee-jerk word  for people to get scared.  And there's no truth  to it whatsoever.  Wait, let me finish.  And you can go to any...  You guys live in New York.  Go to some socialist  professor somewhere.  Talk to Bernie Sanders.  You might know who he is.  He's an...  Well, Bernie Sanders  is a senator  who's a socialist.  A Democratic socialist  senator.  He will tell you this...  All real socialists  will tell you this guy  isn't anywhere near  a socialist,  Barack Obama. 
[03:14:30]  But you just said  that the anti-war  protesters showed up  because they...  It's such a subtle thing.  People don't realize  they're doing it  because they wanted to.  It was a reaction  they wanted to.  Without anybody at all.  And you're saying...  Only liberals can have  grassroots fucking eyes.  And that the TV  was...  It's amazing.  Motherfucker,  what is it true?  Only liberals are allowed  to have grassroots.  You know, that's so cocky  because you're just saying it.  It is bullshit.  Just because more people...  Wait, I'm not a liberal.  I'm not led by you.  Just because there's more  successful conservative radio  and television shows  doesn't mean that  conservatives can't show up  under their own accord.  It just so happens, 
[03:15:00]  coincidentally,  there's more conservative shows.  But every time liberals...  About a hundred to one.  Any time liberals get together,  it's grassroots.  Any time conservatives get together,  it's fucking Klan meeting.  I'll tell you what, Anthony.  If you want to work on  something called fucking...  Oh, New World.  Wait, if you want to talk about  something called evidence,  let's work on evidence.  You tell me where these  radio or TV shows were  that sent people to protest wars  and stuff,  and I'll show you  fucking all kinds of people  that sent people to be  teabaggers in Washington.  Come on, it's ridiculous.  You don't think people  can show up  that they're all shitty 
[03:15:30]  divisive shit.  How did they show up?  They had enough.  That they're pissed off.  Why didn't they show up then  when Bush was president?  How did the anti-war people  get together?  They just thought of it  and just decided to go.  That was the reaction.  That was grassroots.  But they read each other's mind  from the place in time.  None of this shit's real.  It's not real.  It's all bullshit.  It's all against the people.  This argument  or this conversation,  liberal,  up there,  they don't call  these motherfuckers 
[03:16:00]  Barack.  They call him Barry.  They don't give a fuck.  Barack Hussein, Obama.  He owes favors.  He's the fucking...  See, this is the thing  about the president.  Again,  if the president  can come in  in four years,  each four years,  you change  the entire infrastructure  where you come in  and go,  you know what?  War's over,  motherfucker.  No Afghanistan.  No Iraq.  Let's just come up.  The president is nothing.  I don't even understand  why he's the figurehead in this.  He can't stop anything.  You're right.  The next guy's gonna 
[03:16:30]  just do the next thing.  It's horse shit.  I agree with you on that.  The liberals have become  arrogant  and thought policing  and that's what drives me crazy  about anything  in their ideology,  any of their war stances.  We've dealt with it  as entertainers.  It's amazing.  I watch what  Imus got fired for.  I watch what  black performers  don't get fired for.  That's not black people's fault.  That's fucking white people  who are just targeting  other white people  because you hit the fucking  nail on the head.  We're going,  that's the one.  That's the naughty one,  not me.  It's all about  keeping the focus  on the white guilt.  I was upset that  black performers 
[03:17:00]  didn't immediately  stand up  for fucking Imus.  Immediately.  That's the thought  policing shit.  By the way,  Media Matters,  that clip was a week old.  They were the ones  who targeted that.  They didn't target  Al Roker  for doing an epilepsy joke.  Al Roker?  For doing an epilepsy joke.  Do you understand?  Well,  he blogged very heavily  about Imus getting fired.  He's a militant.  He was very,  very vocal  about Imus being fired.  He was very vocal  about Imus being fired.  He's the whitest black guy  in town.  He's a wonderful fellow.  Exactly.  He's not a threat.  Of course.  But do you understand  what I mean?  They target the speech  they don't agree with. 
[03:17:30]  They don't target  other speech  that they do agree with.  They don't target  people who ideologically  they agree with.  So basically  what you're doing  is you call people dumb  because at the end  of the day  I can go,  hey everybody,  get together  and let's do this.  And you're allowed  to go,  at Glenn Beck  if he can get  50,000 people  to go do dumb shit  and let's say  Janine Garofalo  if she wants to get  50,000 people  to go do dumb shit  it's the 50,000 people's fault.  Obama won.  They're fucking stupid 
[03:18:00]  for doing what the fuck  they're told to do.  All this leading the idiots  all the conservative radio  in the world  did not prevent  Barack Obama  from winning the election.  What do you think about that?  I'm sure you got an idea.  I bet you got an idea.  Electronic voting machine.  I'll tell you what it is.  More Americans voted  for him than McCain.  That's what it was.  People wanted to change.  I wanted Obama to win.  I wanted the younger guy.  No, of course not.  I just sit here and talk.  But all of a sudden  there's a Republican  and there's a Republican  governor in what's been  a Democratic state 
[03:18:30]  forever.  It will happen.  It will happen.  White people got fed up.  Yes, the tax is spent.  Wait, hold on.  Wait till 2010.  Hold on, fellas.  Jesus Christ.  You want to look back  through history?  Whenever a new  administration comes in  a whole bunch of states  flip over.  It happens all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  And the right wing  talkers are all  railing about that  when they were looking  for the Hoffman dude  to win in New York 23  and all of a sudden  that doesn't mean anything.  Where the Democrats  That was such a scam.  Oh, there you go.  There you go. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, come on.  It's the same thing.  And the Democrats and liberals  would have been all over that  if it was the other way around.  That fucking Republican  candidate was a Democrat.  She was a fucking Democrat.  Well, she was a Republican.  And she got thrown out.  Yeah.  Some Republican went along  with everything Barack said.  Well, listen.  There are liberal Republicans,  believe it or not,  and far right.  Liberal Republicans.  Yeah, she wasn't a moderate.  Well, how'd she get to be  a Republican all that time?  Who the fuck knows?  It's up there  in goddamn cow country.  But when the conservatives  stepped in, 
[03:19:30]  he had fucking,  his votes were diluted  by this woman.  She wound up getting  The woman bailed out.  She bailed out.  And the percentage of votes  she got after she bailed out  would have put the conservative  guy over the top.  See, you talk about arguing  the same way  Brother Norton's going.  Norton's going,  oh, when the liberals  went out and approached  the war,  they just did it  on their own,  grassroots, sarcastic.  And now you're doing  the same exact thing.  Because it's the arrogance  of the left  that I'm talking about.  It's not the issue.  It's the arrogance  thought policing of the left.  I'm telling you, 
[03:20:00]  you're asking about liberals.  I don't hate liberal ideology.  It's the arrogance.  I know it's better for you  than you do.  I understand the  unwashed masses shit  that liberals have become  which makes me sick  to my stomach  because they're doing  the same thing  they hated the conservatives for.  I dealt with them.  I know when we would  do Tough Crowd,  the things you could  make fun of,  the things you couldn't  make fun of.  If it was a sacred cow  of the right,  it was okay.  You want to shine Catholicism?  Good.  And you should be able to.  But fucking like Larry David,  that fucking,  that little piss drop  on the thing of Christ. 
[03:20:30]  Right, right, right, right.  I would love him  to have done that  with Muhammad.  Never going to happen.  Fucking the phony  New York Times  wouldn't show that fucking...  But why would he do it  to Muhammad?  It ain't a good bit.  You know,  everyone would be cheering.  All the conservatives  would be pumping their ass.  You understand?  It's not a good bit.  Why isn't it a good bit?  Well, fucking Muhammad.  Why wouldn't the New York Times...  First of all,  I don't know  what a picture of Muhammad  looks like.  Exactly.  Why wouldn't the New York Times  show that picture  that the Danish cartoonists did?  Why wouldn't they show that  but they still showed  Piss Christ?  Why wouldn't any of the  New York papers show that?  The media completely 
[03:21:00]  left it alone.  Why?  Because they're afraid  of Islam.  They're afraid of the  violence in Islam  and they won't say it.  South Park,  one of the only edits  they ever did  was when they wanted  to portray Muhammad  and they said  absolutely not.  They very rarely will see it.  Shut the head.  No, they didn't do it.  And they came out  and they gave this statement.  Because of recent world events,  they won't even name Islam.  So they're more afraid  of Islam than they are  of right-wing Christians?  There you go.  They're afraid  by far.  Of course they are.  Of course.  I am.  Terrified.  The way they shit  all over Christianity  they are much more  afraid of Islam.  Yeah, I don't know. 
[03:21:30]  Much more afraid.  Right-wing Christians.  Who is, though?  Every newspaper  that would never print  that Danish cartoon.  But who is the  holding the strings  that says that  they're not allowed  to do that?  Good question.  I don't think  the editor gives a fuck  who's the editor  of the newscast.  Wait, no,  who's the higher,  who's the higher  that's saying  that's wrong?  I think we as a society,  our whole fucking  way of life  is afraid  of offending Islam.  Of a guy running in  with a bomb, yes.  More so than 
[03:22:00]  offending Christianity  or any other religion.  Christianity is safe  to make fun of  compared to the other,  especially compared to Islam.  But the retribution  is fucking tragic.  Well, you guys  are the fucking  poster childs  for you don't fuck  with Christianity.  We didn't say it.  That's not true at all.  We shit all over Islam.  We shit all over Christianity.  We shit all over.  No, but I'm saying,  no, you're not saying  you're a hypocrite.  I'm saying  that you lost your jobs  because Christians  banded together  and got you fucking  No, we didn't.  No, we didn't.  No, we didn't.  We lost our jobs  because the company 
[03:22:30]  that sanctioned the contest  fucking backed out.  Because what?  Bill Donahue.  Because pressure from  Absolutely.  I don't fault Bill Donahue.  I don't fault Al Sharpton either.  I don't fault Sharpton  and Jesse Jackson  for getting Imus fired.  I fault fucking  Les Moonves  for buckling  when he didn't have to.  I fault the fucking companies  for buckling  because they think  it's Selma in 1960  and it's going to be  a boycott that's going to hurt you.  It's ultimately  a,  it's,  this is what I'm trying  to get back to  is human.  All these labels,  it's about humans  being liars.  It's about lying.  If people didn't lie, 
[03:23:00]  then we wouldn't be  pointing our fingers  at this one  or that one.  The New York Times guy  is going by the fact  that we all are liars  right now.  Anthony to me,  look,  and fucking,  um,  Colin?  Yeah,  Colin's,  somebody,  Colin's back here  yawning.  Poor Colin.  Me and Colin  are playing hangman.  Anthony and Colin  what, bro?  Colin's thinking  he left his Ben Gay 
[03:23:30]  at home.  He's getting tired.  I'm saying  at the end of the day,  I was going to,  I'm giving Colin  you credit  because at least  we can have  racial conversations.  Everybody thinks  just because you  talk race  that you're racist.  I know.  People can just be racial  and get it out  just so we're not  as led around  by these discussions  about who's doing what  and who's afraid.  Why the fuck would,  it's the,  it's the,  it's the,  uh,  the Russ Limbaugh thing.  He can't buy  a fucking football team. 
[03:24:00]  The motherfucker  that owns  the Pittsburgh Steelers  never owned a slave,  nigga?  So Russ Limbaugh  is the racist  but these all white dudes  that own football teams  aren't fucking  the Dallas Cowboy  motherfucker.  He,  you,  that Texas oil baron.  Yeah.  He loves black people.  Like,  I'm just saying  Mark Schott  was able to own  a fucking baseball team.  Exactly.  Like,  so that's what I don't want to,  I don't want to be  a fucking slave  to the fact that 
[03:24:30]  you're going to tell me  who the villains are  and this and that.  Let's have,  let's have real conversations.  We're having one right now.  Fucking Rush Limbaugh,  Rush Limbaugh's the villain.  I'm not defending him  but you're going to tell me  these other,  what,  Rush Limbaugh's going to get  in the NFL and go,  I'm going to try to win  a game with all white players.  Like,  get the fuck out of here.  He's as racist  as anybody else  who I can't prove it.  It's true.  Fuck out of here, man.  It's true.  White people are stereotyping  black people  and they're racist.  Maybe you'd like to look 
[03:25:00]  on Maury right now.  I'm fine, baby.  The DNA test.  Let me just get one.  Can I get finished?  The reason is  people are afraid of Islam.  I would be too.  I'm not saying  that they're dumb  to be afraid of Islam.  What bothers me  is the fucking phony attacks  on other religions  and they won't come out  and say,  we won't show that cartoon  because we're afraid  of a suicide bomber  coming in,  which is the reality.  And I wouldn't fault them  for that.  I'm not saying I'm ballsy  but there were people  that quit.  I think it was the New York  Press or the Village Voice  because they wouldn't show  that cartoon. 
[03:25:30]  The Village Voice?  The reporters were quitting  because the paper  fucking copped out.  They would not address  Islam honestly.  And they won't just say  we're afraid of them  because they react  really violently.  They attack  right with Christianity  all the time  and they should.  But let me just say  one last thing  about this liberal  conservative shit.  And I know I ain't  sinking crap in  with you dudes.  Here's the deal, bro.  Since Barack Obama  has been the president  and before in history,  there are radio stations,  I'll just use Rush Limbaugh's  for instance.  Rush Limbaugh has a show.  He did it with Bill Clinton.  That's how he became famous, 
[03:26:00]  Rush Limbaugh.  Rush Limbaugh has three hours  a day, every single day  and his whole mission  is to bring down  Barack Obama.  That's what the show is.  A hundred percent.  I get his emails  every day, Jim.  I'll get his emails  every single day.  I'll show them to you.  I thought they had  a fairness doctrine thing.  No, that was the liberals  crying because people  don't want liberal radio  so they were like,  well, if they get it,  we should have it.  They don't want the  fairness doctrine anywhere else.  They don't want it in sports.  They don't want it anywhere else.  But they want it with talk radio  where people are expressing  opinions because people  didn't want to hire 
[03:26:30]  liberal talkers.  So like, well,  how can we get in there?  Oh, let's make it a fucking  government mandated thing.  It's bullshit.  By the way,  the fairness doctrine  was in existence once.  Then it was taken away.  It should be.  When I was on the radio,  if you had a dude on,  you had to have  the other dude on.  If you talked about  one side,  you had to talk about  the other side,  which in all honesty  will make for a smarter  populace.  But in the meantime,  you got a bunch  of radio shows  that dedicate their shows  to bringing down  your president.  That never,  ever happened  in the day, 
[03:27:00]  ever.  They're all getting,  the thing is,  you know the fairness doctrine.  Come on.  Forget the fairness doctrine.  I'm not saying that.  That's not what I'm talking about.  Rush probably wanted Obama.  And this is how dumb  the Democrats are.  I hear you.  This is how dumb they are.  I hear you.  Obama addressed Hannity  and he addressed,  he addressed fucking Rush  by name,  like the Republican Party.  They're just talkers.  He was harsher with Rush Limbaugh  than he was with Ahmadinejad  or fucking anything  that's going on  in the Middle East.  He had hard words  for Rush Limbaugh.  That's because some people  believe that diplomacy  might be a good thing. 
[03:27:30]  I know you guys  don't underwrite.  You'd rather bomb  every Muslim off the planet.  Bullshit.  Not true at all.  I'm all for diplomacy.  Then what's wrong  with diplomacy?  Nothing.  But I'm saying  Obama reached his handout  to a guy who said  that he wants Israel  wiped off the face  of the map.  And Israel,  if we don't do something,  is going to attack Iran.  That's what's going to happen.  I will say something  about the Muslim community  in this country.  There's some silent motherfuckers.  See, here's the thing  about other groups.  Black people will,  every group has the other group  in it that will say, 
[03:28:00]  we're not associated  with that motherfucker.  Yes.  Now, here's the thing.  Wait a minute.  Here's the thing.  In England,  it's harder to be  that racist in England  against Muslims  because they live  with the community  like fucking Puerto Ricans  live with people  in New York.  Not in my fucking  New York.  Here,  fucking Muslims,  if Muslims start  running around  bombing malls  and doing all that 
[03:28:30]  goofy shit they do  in England and Israel,  bad things are going  to happen to all Muslims.  So if they can  differentiate between  the ones that we go  them,  which is what  niggas had to do  and ages had to do  where if black people  start flying planes  and the shit,  most likely  it'll be those black people  and not,  oh,  here we go  with this shit here.  But mum's the word.  Because Islam  is very peaceful.  It's a very peaceful  fucking religion.  Patrice,  wait,  I just want to tell you  something because  this is what happens 
[03:29:00]  on the radio.  Patrice just said  you don't see the Muslim  coming out speaking against,  correct?  And you just say that?  Well,  in terms of saying,  but on the streets  too,  brother Weez,  on the streets,  if you ask a Muslim  where they think they go,  well,  you know,  it's a thing that  we have to do  what we,  you know.  Never like,  fuck him.  Never like,  fuck that dude  for blowing up shit.  Ever.  Listen,  this is what I want to say.  Just yesterday  on MSNBC,  they had a Muslim broad 
[03:29:30]  to some professor  at some big school  here in this country  that was up  screaming against  the Muslims.  And she's a deep Muslim  studier  and knows the religion  and the whole deal.  And she wants more people  to come out.  But she was up there  for 15 minutes  as a Muslim  denouncing the Muslims,  the violent Muslims  and the extremists.  Muslim extremists.  Because a lot of people  in this country,  and I'm not going to say  you know,  Billy.  But look at the point,  look at the point you're making though.  Muslims are Muslims.  You're just making more people  to come out.  The point is, 
[03:30:00]  but he didn't think she  exactly.  No, no, no.  Of course.  It was on the exception  to the rules show.  Yes.  Yes.  Where's just some dude,  if you talk to a cab driver,  you know you like to talk to people.  People like to talk.  And it's like,  you talk to a cab driver  and you go,  hey man,  what's going on over here?  You'll go,  all right.  They'll never go.  You talk to 20 Muslims  or 20 dudes  you think are Muslims  and ask about this situation  and see if they go,  it's all fucked up.  It's all fucked up.  The Israel, 
[03:30:30]  fucking Palestine,  shit's all goofy.  The fucking Indian,  India versus Pakistan is goofy.  You won't hear those people  say that that shit's goofy.  They won't do it.  So that's why they put themselves  in a spot  to go,  all of you.  If Asians,  Asians went,  this is the problem with Muslims.  They haven't went through  this shit yet.  This is their time  to go through this shit  like Asians did.  Asians have earned their place  to go suck my balls  because they've been put in  fucking concentration camps 
[03:31:00]  during World War II.  They scooped them up,  threw them into some fucking camp  because they're fucking Chinese.  Yeah,  that was some bad shit.  They went through it.  The Muslims haven't gone through  the shit  that makes the ones go,  hey,  I live here and I love it.  Them motherfuckers  that do dumb shit,  fuck them  so that we won't look at them  all the same  because Asian people  blew up a mall.  You would not look at all Asians  like they blow malls up  because they earned their spot.  Muslims haven't earned  their fucking duty yet. 
[03:31:30]  Asians also never attacked us  from within as civilians.  Asians also,  no other group,  it's the first time  we're dealing with this,  whereas,  and this is why  the internment camps  were so wrong in World War II,  it is because  Islam has purposefully  used the way we live  and attacked us  as civilians.  So it's not like  they came in here  as a paramilitary group,  they were just civilians.  So they trained us  to look at all civilians  suspiciously,  and then we look at  civilians suspiciously  and we're accused  of being racist.  There's no way to win that.  So you're sitting ducks  or you're smart  and you're profiled.  Which is what those  shitty movies  that have a guy  give a speech in him.  Like,  you Americans 
[03:32:00]  are so stupid.  Because they know the deal.  I'm a more buying citizen.  And you know,  it's this goofy shit.  You have to arrest me.  Muslims have to go  through that shit.  People make me laugh.  They have to turn  in this pressure.  They have to deal  with the pressure.  I want Weezed, yes.  I just want to tell you this,  the right wing  always brings up  the fact that Fox  is the man  and they got the ratings  and like somehow  that makes it the truth.  But just let me remind you,  the Transformers  was the number one movie.  Just remember that shit.  No, please.  I remember that shit. 
[03:32:30]  It's important.  The Transformers  is a day in,  day out event.  You know ratings run  the world  when it comes to stations  and making money.  And I'm saying that  for some reason  those guys get numbers.  I mean,  they kill,  T. Goldman's on the air  because he gets ratings.  I mean,  he doesn't do as well  as Hannity,  but he gets fucking ratings.  I got to say something  about that,  what you just said.  I'm not saying  it makes it the truth.  I'm not saying  it makes it good.  That's what I feel like  you're saying.  No, no, no.  They have the ratings,  but what it does is  it gives the left  an excuse to say  things like, 
[03:33:00]  oh,  the people that showed up  weren't angry about taxes.  They were racist  baited by the stations.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  That's fair.  They were baited  by the stations  that have the huge viewership  and huge listenership  instead of just going,  you know something,  I'm tired of paying taxes  and there is a demonstration  about it  and I feel passionate enough  to go and represent  this cause.  But it's suspect,  my brother,  because the motherfuckers,  if you actually believe  in your goddamn heart 
[03:33:30]  that why these people  weren't there  during the Bush regime,  but they showed up  after Glenn Beck  and Fox News,  but bro,  forget,  but God damn it,  the evidence,  when did their tax change?  Nothing fucking changed.  Poof.  Let me tell you something.  You're telling me  your life has changed.  I'm telling you,  my fucking,  my taxes have gone up already.  I must not have noticed.  They have fucking...  Is Hannity's rating  where it's just...  Yeah,  my...  Combs left?  Yeah, Hannity's fucking... 
[03:34:00]  him and O'Reilly  destroy everybody.  You know what it is?  And this is something that,  maybe not directly  because of Obama,  but Obama's saying  people that make  more than $250,000  a year...  Yeah, but it didn't happen yet.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, not there yet.  Hold it.  Not there yet.  But when you get Obama,  the president,  the one that's changing things,  everyone's looking up to,  saying,  we want to tax people  that make $250,000  a year or more.  Right, right, right, right.  Then lower government,  use his example,  like they did  in my fucking county,  and tax the shit out of me.  Oh, you got taxing  your county.  So now their whole thing 
[03:34:30]  is by Democrats  that are running  the fucking county.  Oh, all those Swazi.  Oops, he might be out now.  He was tiptoeing his way  going, la-dee-dee,  I think I'm winning  and I'll recount  what's like the Republicans.  By the way, Anthony,  all of this is...  The bigger thing is...  There was a catchphrase  of everyone going,  $250,000 a month.  You're directing...  Now it's...  Now it's everyone's hands  on the mind.  You're directing your anger  at the wrong thing  because at the end...  Wait a minute.  At the end of the day,  we're all,  no matter how much money we got,  we're all paying back 
[03:35:00]  a loan  that the government  takes out  from a fucking bank.  This is not about...  This is about people.  It's not about  fucking your county.  I want to simplify it.  They need your money  to pay back  fucking Chinese people.  I want to simplify it.  Anthony's pissed  because they just  taxed him on his  new Messerschmitt.  I don't know.  I want to keep it simple.  I make X amount of money.  I want to keep  X amount of that money  and it's getting less  and less and less.  It's not your money.  Fuck you.  It don't belong to you.  I'm sitting my ass 
[03:35:30]  in the chair  every fucking day.  I know fuck you.  And I pay my fucking bid  on taxes.  I know.  And I always have.  And the motherfuckers,  it's never enough.  I know it's fuck you.  Never enough.  But it's not ever enough.  How much do you want to pay in tax?  How much do you want to pay?  How much is enough, Gordon?  When will you reach a point  where you go,  fuck these guys?  Here's the unfortunate truth.  Never.  Because I think you're full of shit.  Why?  I think you're a Republican,  elitist, rich guy.  Let me, let me,  give me a minute.  Wait, let me tell you.  All right, all right.  Then I want to retort.  I'm sure this is your joint. 
[03:36:00]  I have friends where I live  really rich, right?  This is my life experience.  I have some really  fucking rich friends,  obviously all Republicans,  and they're bitching,  and they're moaning  about all this crap  which hasn't even touched them.  These people got all the crap  that Colin was just  making jokes on you.  I'm not bullshitting you.  planes.  These motherfuckers  that are worried about  people getting healthcare  or any kind of handout,  they're going to have  one less Ferrari.  I ain't bullshitting you.  You don't think they're paying?  So wait a minute.  No, they've already  given their Ferrari. 
[03:36:30]  Now they want both  of their fucking Ferrari.  No, they don't.  They're the ones  taxed up the ass.  Okay, here's the bottom line.  Let me just finish.  I think unemployment's at 10%.  Bottom line,  bottom line that I know for sure.  They're all collateral.  Bottom line that I know for sure.  All my rich friends  are going to stay rich  and die rich.  But not as rich, maybe.  Come on, man.  We just passed through life.  I believe Hillary.  I understand.  I believe it takes a village.  And I'm not bullshitting you.  I saw that Oprah show  where it went around the world.  I'm sure you guys  don't look at that.  You think you'll grow 
[03:37:00]  a vagina or something.  But I watched that Oprah show  because I like it.  And she had these people  from all over the world  and I forgot which country.  Norway or something.  50%.  These people were paying.  50%.  And they got everything.  They had everything.  This healthcare thing.  That's because you're all white.  That's right.  That's why.  Can you imagine, honestly,  if we had healthcare  and don't start with  the anecdotes about Canada.  If you had that healthcare  and you didn't have to  take it out of your money  from work  or if some guy  with a business  didn't have to pay  half of every cat  that worked there 
[03:37:30]  and you didn't have to  worry about getting sick.  I mean, this is all  a good life.  It's good.  Sounds good.  It is good.  As more hands  go into my pocket.  Big fuck your pocket.  You know what?  Someone's got to have a pocket.  One day they're going  to your fucking bank account  and take what they need  as opposed to  fucking this pretend  When did America  become a place  that guarantees  people  Life, liberty,  and pursuit of happiness?  Yes.  Pursuit.  Pursuit.  Chase that motherfucker.  And if you catch it,  best of luck to you.  Let me ask you this one question.  Why is this country 
[03:38:00]  the one that brags  about being the best country  in the world  the only industrialized country  that doesn't take care  of their people?  Free and abroad.  Competition  and insane games.  Are you serious?  Wait, wait.  Listen to me.  But he's talking to me.  Weezy's talking humanity.  Anthony, that is...  I pay.  You're making it sound like  I'm sitting there  with gold to blue.  You want to?  I pay.  And listen, Monopoly man.  You can't ask.  And they want more.  We do have health care.  We have the best health care  in the world. 
[03:38:30]  That's why we're ranked.  That's why we're ranked  in the 30s.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Yeah, when everybody  needs a surgery for something  they go to fucking Guam.  By the way, okay.  Well, actually Guam.  They go to fucking Africa.  Evidence?  Evidence?  Can we do evidence?  Right now there's something  and it was in the Parade magazine  of all things.  Insert in the Sunday paper.  That thing's too edgy.  Probably.  They have things called  surgical vacations.  But you know,  that's what...  I don't want to call you guys bad.  People are going to Mexico  and getting surgery.  People are going to a lot of places  and getting surgery.  Brazil is my favorite place 
[03:39:00]  where people go.  Anything happens.  Thank you, Cal.  But this is what kills me.  That's certain types of surgery  though down there.  They get a vagina.  But listen,  people are traveling  to many places  to get operations.  But here's what kills me.  You motherfuckers going,  we got the best healthcare.  We don't have the best healthcare.  We might have the best doctors  and technology.  Yes, yes, yes.  Healthcare.  The word care means  someone's getting taken care of.  Where else in the world?  And don't bring up  one of these little shit countries  that have little people  like Sweden.  Come up with a big country. 
[03:39:30]  Well, there's a problem.  There are 40 people  in a whole fucking country.  40 people.  One thing I like about Weezy  is he argues about it like this.  He's like talking  political intellectual.  He's like,  you motherfuckers.  Well, listen to me.  Because he doesn't get  the curse of his.  Right.  What other country  can you walk into  the emergency room  and get everything  taken care of?  Tons of them.  No.  Yes.  Except a little...  Don't mention Sweden.  What, Canada's that little?  Space-wise are pretty big.  Even the most liberal  Canadians I know  say you're making  the mistake of your life.  Oh, but you're...  Fuck you, Colin.  That is anecdotal bullshit. 
[03:40:00]  It's bullshit.  It is bullshit.  We all know it.  How much bullshit?  Colin, you're bullshit.  I'm like, Jimmy's being sarcastic.  You waited all this time  to just say some  fucking dumb shit, Colin.  Shut the fuck up, man.  The dollar is falling.  Shut up.  I swear to God,  it's anecdotal.  It's a true fact.  It's not true facts.  Let's make some phone calls.  I do it all.  Let's call Canada.  Let's call Canada.  Let's call Canada.  Let's get a guy  on the phone random.  And what happens  if he says to you...  By the way,  I got a comic  that was just on my show. 
[03:40:30]  American Kid  that married a Canadian brother  up in Edmonton.  Fantastic.  Anecdotal.  You know,  they had a baby,  she had...  It didn't cause...  No.  It didn't cause them...  What are you talking about?  When I said anecdotal,  it was bullshit.  Because I'm responding to yours.  Oh, but I'm saying...  You're anecdotal...  Because you just said  everybody in Canada  says it sucks.  Everybody that calls...  I don't mean everybody.  You said everybody in Canada.  Okay, hold on.  Unfortunately for me,  I broadcast from across the water  from Canada.  I actually have Canadian listeners.  Yeah.  These people call up all the time  saying, 
[03:41:00]  I cannot believe  what you people  in your country are doing.  And people don't want healthcare.  I'm anecdotal.  You know something?  Anecdotal.  If it could be done  without more fucking mitts  in my wallet...  What if it could be done?  God bless.  Because I have...  I'm done fucking paying  for everybody.  Wait, what if it could be done  with putting mitts  in your pocket?  No.  So you must not like Jesus.  No, it's nothing to do  with religion.  Jesus wants people  to have healthcare.  Here's what it is.  America.  A place on this great globe 
[03:41:30]  of ours that you come to  or are born in.  Yeah.  And you have the opportunity  to, through luck,  through wealth,  through skills...  At least he came up with luck.  No, no, it's true.  But it's true.  There's a little bit  of everything involved.  That's what makes  this a great country.  And there's no difference  between that  and about 50 other countries,  by the way, Patrice.  Go ahead, Patrice.  To get as high up  as you want,  there is no obligation  to the person  that succeeded  to take care of  or bring up anyone  beneath them.  So let me ask you this.  Is it righteous?  Is it nice? 
[03:42:00]  Of course it fucking is.  Is it mandatory?  No.  Not here.  But wait a minute.  No.  Let's say you were  a guy in Toronto.  I don't know  if you've ever been there.  Yeah.  One of the great cities  in the world.  Great big city.  And you have all those  exact opportunities  that you just mentioned  plus they take care  of everybody.  A little better.  Same exact opportunity  that you just mentioned.  Take care of the mismanagement  for the money.  What if everybody  paid  a fixed amount 
[03:42:30]  towards  like 50%  or whatever the percentage  they have  they pay towards healthcare.  Because look it.  I'm both sides.  I think our healthcare system  it's not bad.  it's just  it's just  shit.  It's just  85% of people  are insured.  Wait a minute though.  On a human level  15% not bad.  That's a lot of motherfuckers.  85% of the people  in this country  are insured?  Yes.  Why are we  fucking complaining?  Exactly.  15% is not insured?  15%  always 
[03:43:00]  fucking crazy.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  By the way.  Wait, wait, wait.  You might want to talk  to some of the cocksuckers  that were insured  that are broke now  with insurers.  Don't line up the phones.  But the kids that work  for me that just had babies  for instance  with insurance  that they paid dearly for  had to pay thousands.  Oh, because they lost  their jobs?  No, no, no, no.  What happened to them?  Don't fucking ask me.  I'll call them.  They keep telling me this.  I don't understand  it my own self.  But what about  the people with insurance?  You're just being led  blindly by them. 
[03:43:30]  I think so, bro.  What about the people  with insurance  that are still going?  What about the people  denied surgeries  with insurance?  If you deny the fact  that insurance companies  have a person  with a job  their whole job  is to deny you  an operation  then you're not  being truthful.  Well, isn't that  Patrice, how ugly?  That's an ugly thing.  It's an ugly thing.  It's ugly, but you can't.  But here's  the human part of it.  This is what  fucks me up.  We don't talk  the human part is  there's somebody  with a job  to tell you 
[03:44:00]  that you're going to die.  There you go.  And if people decided  that I'm not going  to take a job  where I'm just going  to allow people to die  because I was told  to allow people to die  it's my thing about  the fucking  I'm sorry, Carl  it's the thing about  the whole thing  Hitler and I  I know I keep saying this  but it's like  who do you hate more  Hitler for going  I hate Jews  I'm going to kill him  or a bunch of motherfuckers  who just go do it  because they told him to  who the fuck is wrong? 
[03:44:30]  I take a job to say  Patrice  you've got to pay  fucking  you've got to pay  insurance  for a year  but you have diabetes  wait a minute  you've got diabetes  you've got to pay  for a year  400 a month  for a year  before we ever  take care of your diabetes  pre-existing condition  I'll be dead  before I fucking get help  that doesn't sound good  it doesn't  and neither does  you go out  and crash your car  50 times  your premiums  are going to be  a little high  on your car insurance  that's a stupid  I'm doing a cold blooded 
[03:45:00]  study on insurance  which is  the higher the risk  the more you're going to pay  it's a risk assessment  but that's not a nice country  it's not a nice country  it's true  it's not a nice country  I want to take care  of my brothers and sisters  fuck me  you're a good man  and you know something  90% tax your ass  and 30% tax mine  I'm in  because I'm an asshole  and maybe in the next world  you'll get a better place  than I will  I don't even believe  there is a nice world  are you an atheist Andy? 
[03:45:30]  I am  nah  I know that  there's probably something  but I don't fucking understand  Anthony that's agnostic  agnostic  yeah  I'm just like  he don't believe in nothing  by the way  no by the way  no bro  I just told you  you didn't hear my story  I'm a Jehovah's Witness now  legit  legit  really?  no Christmas?  no medication  no medication  they say  there's only 100,000 people  going to make it to him  I'm number 100,000  right into the wire  I got in late  and they don't vote 
[03:46:00]  I ain't voting no more  yeah Jehovah's Witnesses don't vote  wait you don't vote anymore?  I'm a Witness  yeah Jehovah's Witnesses don't vote  they didn't tell me that yet  this ain't real  bro this is real  I'll show you the letter  bro listen to this  I'll show you the letter  real quick  the Witnesses came to my door  so I answered the door  because I'm like  really don't like  organized religion  I don't want to piss anybody off here  I like the Bill Mark take  I'm sure someone hates them  in here somewhere  so anyway  that's the way I am  so they come up to my door  and I answered the door  right up to my door  and I go  you guys  I'm the antichrist 
[03:46:30]  you came to the wrong joint  and you know they sold me  I'm not kidding you  I dug their rep  so I started  wait what do they say  that sold you?  well one of the things  they say is  they don't go to war  wait you talk about  Fox leading people  and you fell for the  the Witnesses rap  that was good  put a box of watchtowers  that was gonna hurt  that's good though bro  that was gonna hurt you a little bit  that's a beautiful piece  you don't believe in war  and you were over there  three fucking tours 
[03:47:00]  right  well wait a minute  that's why  my tours in Vietnam  are why  I don't even want to get into  you were talking about  Afghanistan last night  you don't want any more  of the boys going over there  no I don't want anybody  and wants a lot of the guys  to go over there  no I didn't say that  holy fuck  I did not say that  you want to send us  soldiers to die  Anthony  16 years  hold on  hold on  fuck you man  you want to send  high school kids  over there now  that's right  I said as far as  soldiers go  and as far as 
[03:47:30]  commanders go  I can't wait  you want to go back to Iraq  I said  when you listen to them  when they are given  an order  by their president  and you  you send them  and give them  every resource  they need  to finish the job  or  you get them  the fuck home  and get them out  I heard a dude  called a political  talk show the other day  and my blood boils  and they talk about  Vietnam  and they go  the same rap you just did  that's the bullshit  they keep talking now  you give them all the stuff  so we can finish it  here's a bulletin 
[03:48:00]  for the dumb motherfuckers  there is no finishing it  I understand that  Alexander the Great  till today  you can't beat  that Afghani motherfucker  don't leave it  half ass  sitting in the middle  of something  then take them home  then get them home  it was half ass  when we got there  then assess the situation  and go  we can't win this  get everybody  and don't help them  the next time  somebody invades  dumb assholes  we are  we should let the Russians  do what they wanted  why do we never look  like if this  what are we over there doing  that's what I'm saying  what is we 
[03:48:30]  market business  keeping the world safe  for democracy  get it man  what the fuck  but I heard this dude  call up this political  talk show about Vietnam  because a lot of guys  say that  if we have what we need  and I went three times  if we have what we needed  and finish it  I wanted to pose the question  what was finished  they want to blow up  the whole joint  that's what they're talking about  when they say finish  any of these wars  they mean blow up  the whole fuck  kill every motherfucker  that's ridiculous

[03:49:30]  that says  fuck you  they need people  so they can go in there  and keep the shit  fucking green card  by the way  Patrice  he's a benevolent dictator  see that's another word  he loves his people  he takes care of the people  he loves his people  that's why they fucking hate him  and the cold people  in Brooklyn  right  didn't he buy the oil  for people around here  he's  he loves his people  he loves his people  and that's what  they hate dictators  who fucking  are really for the people  that's why they hate  Tadstrom  they fucking hate 
[03:50:00]  they loved Hitler  oh did they love Hitler  he's not for the people  shut up he sure was  he sure was  did you see all the people  come out at the rallies  certain people he wasn't for  but he was for  you know  you gotta gang  you know you just hit me  you gotta gang them up  against someone else  you just hit me  with a big ball of literal  you used Hitler  Hitler was not  a man of the people  he just was charismatic  but I'm just saying  you can use Hitler  five minutes  you go for your argument  I think  I'm gonna tell you something  I think every ideology  has a benevolent point to it 
[03:50:30]  I think communism  has a great point to it  so it's the people  running it  that fucks it up  by the way  I got good news  for everybody here  I don't know if you guys  saw this  a couple weeks ago  I went to the movie theater  saw Brad Pitt  and them cast  Kill the Hitler  I was proud as a mother  they killed the Hitler  he died  I didn't know he went down  until I went to that flick  they got him  Inglourious Bastards  Norton you didn't see that  I did not  no  I heard  I like  I like Terrence  you know a lot  I heard mixed reviews about it  oh I liked it  I think you dig it  are we ready for final statements here 
[03:51:00]  final statements  alright  who wants to start  not all white people are bad  I respect and appreciate  Weez's point of view  I don't think you do  no matter how stupid it is  thank you  yeah and I will come back  with the fact that  one of the luckiest men  on the planet  Anthony  sitting over there  fucking stepped in a pile  of shit  his dopey  thank you  you fucking  this is what kills me  his last callus 
[03:51:30]  on his fingers  healed yesterday  he's just a fucking  fix refrigerator  and this cucks sucker  is Lord Barrington the third  like you're an asshole  I got mine motherfucker  I got mine  wait and even worse than that  I heard rumors  that this lucky  motherfucker  goes to casinos  take this  he doesn't want to pay  for the poor people's  health care  but he'll give Atlantic City  50, 100,000 dollars  because he's an idiot  they employ a shitload of people 
[03:52:00]  don't they  yeah but Trump got the money  not those people  well you know something  Trump employs some people too  but let's tax the shit out of people  that employ people  and keep unemployment  at 10% or higher  wait you had your final statement  you really did  you really had your final statement  my final statement is  oh Colin yes  whose dream  five years ago  was to someday  work the walk-in freezers  now he's got a fucking  panzer tank in the back 
[03:52:30]  fucking Colin  Colin's gonna be a  Caroline's what  tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday  right Colin  yeah  Caroline's from Colin  where's Norton gonna be  well wait  he's got his final statement  we're doing a final statement  sorry  well yeah  that's a good question though  November 25th  I'll be at the stress factory  the night before Thanksgiving  excellent question  will you see your post  thank you  here's where the liberals  lose me  liberals don't lose me  on the ideology  you don't lose me  on your beliefs  some I'm with  some I'm not  I'm for gay marriage 
[03:53:00]  for most of them  I'm pretty socially liberal  gay marriage  I know  can you imagine  but liberals lose me  on the language policing  they do  and the fucking  arrogance  they think everybody else  is a lead sheep  and they are these  brilliant intellectual thinkers  who see it for what it really is  and that arrogance  they are exactly what they hated  in the 60s and before  so that's my problem  with the liberals  November 24th  can I respond 
[03:53:30]  because I was  sure  but this is what freaks me out  my brother  first of all  I think you're the smartest guy  in the room  not that anybody gives a shit  what I think  thank you  I wholeheartedly agree with you  not that anybody cares  but  he's gonna be dead in 2012  like everybody else  so fuck  fuck this smartest guy  in the fucking room  he's gonna be laying  right under the  rape picture  of the Statue of Liberty  like everybody else  with a dress up  but the deal is  with people  you see the liberalism  that's in my heart  is  forget the snottyness  I know that  I mean if you don't think 
[03:54:00]  that down there  where they fly  the confederate flag  if you don't think  there's a whole bunch  if you go to the dumb places  where comedians make fun of  just played Alabama  they didn't get the joke  that crap  if you go down there  I'd say that  you're gonna be pissed at me  but I'd say  that most of them  were conservative followers  I don't think you're gonna find  many liberals  in these places  and I wouldn't be that proud of that  but the thing is  when Rush Limbaugh  tells his listeners all the time  think for yourselves  you know he's always going  they think that you're too dumb  well you know what I really believe 
[03:54:30]  I really do believe  people are too dumb  and I know that you know it too  look at this country  I actually don't know that  I really don't  are you shitting me  I really don't  because  as a guy who watches Fox  who doesn't  I'm not even talking about that  or any of that stuff  that I would be considered  a follower for  I know I form my own opinions  I'm not returned to any of that  I don't buy the whole  there are some dummies sure  but there's also dummies  in college campuses  all over this fucking country  listening to their professors  they're smarter though bro  they gotta be a little smarter  not by much  the same ones that wouldn't protest  Ahmadinejad  who did protest  when the Minutemen went to speak 
[03:55:00]  they started a riot  when the Minutemen went to speak  at Columbia University  and Ahmadinejad was welcomed  with open arms  and told the fucking  the  whatever the fuck  the head of Columbia was  really devastated  and humiliated him  which I respect  but the students  they're fucking sheep  but it freaks me out  the conservatives  that I meet  that go  the only reason I'm conservative  is that tax thing  what a smoke screen  I believe that  if you're liberally  if you're socially liberal  that you should be  a goddamn liberal  because that's what  they're fighting the war about  I'm fighting for the fags  to get married 
[03:55:30]  sorry about that word  I'm fighting for gay marriage  and it was the liberals  once again  that made  black people  couldn't even marry  white broads legally  that's the truth  thank you for nothing  they still don't marry you  but anyway  just leave them  with a couple of Barack's  and then they move on  and Jim  they just ruined their  relationships with their dads  Jim  do not  a couple of Lenny Kravitz's  and they bust off  do not the conservatives  use the gay marriage  and abortion  as their biggest issue  when elections come up  that's what they use 
[03:56:00]  sir  you're probably on the  other side of that issue  yet you'll stick with them  we gotta wrap up  what's the website  to listen to you  I'm not going to tell  wheeze.com  I'm not telling  wheeze.com  I don't want to tell people  wheeze.canadianhealthcare.com  we got replays  who gives a shit  wheeze.canadianhealthcare.com  it's wheeze.com  if you want to listen to  his show online  where the fuck is he going  call of duty  by the way  my show's not political  at all  I got shit to do  where's he going  where you going  shoot somebody  shoot somebody 
[03:56:30]  where you going  to count your money  he said the truth  the first time  he just doesn't want  the uncomfortableness  when the mics are off  the awkward  he's going to play  call of duty  alright listen  Patrice is going to be  at Bananas  Hesburgh Heights  right  tonight and tomorrow  everyone got their  final statements in  alright let's get out  of here  well there was one thing  no </pre>
