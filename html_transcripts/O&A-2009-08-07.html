<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with Opie and Anthony, alongside Jim Norton, expressing outrage at their exclusion from a WBCN anniversary celebration, highlighting the absurdity of being snubbed while convicted child molester Mark Parenteau and Peter Wolfe were invited.  They lament the lack of recognition for their contributions to the station and recount similar slights from WAAF.  Listener calls offer humorous speculation on the reasons for their exclusion.  The conversation shifts to the death of John Hughes, interspersed with clips from *Pretty in Pink* featuring Andrew Dice Clay.  The show then launches into a critique of attorney Dominic Barbara's handling of a high-profile Taconic Parkway crash case, accusing him of self-promotion and insensitivity.  Joe Rogan and Jim Jefferies are announced as upcoming guests.

The next segment opens with a discussion of a drunk driving accident involving children, transitioning back to criticism of Dominic Barbara's perceived self-promotion despite claiming pro bono work. A caller relates a story about his stepfather bypassing a car breathalyzer. The discussion expands to the dangers of driving, including distracted driving, and features a humorous tangent about dedicated "skipping lanes."  Joe Rogan joins the studio, along with Bobby Kelly, and the conversation turns to an upcoming UFC fight. Rogan provides detailed commentary on Brock Lesnar and Forrest Griffin, discussing performance-enhancing drugs in UFC and the realism of the *Undisputed* video game.  Rogan concludes with a graphic anecdote about a large booger and a claim of drinking his own urine.  Numerous callers contribute to the conversation.


The show continues with a discussion sparked by Joe Rogan's tweet about drinking urine, leading to a conversation about its purported health benefits and Lyoto Machida's alleged practice.  The conversation quickly devolves into graphic comparisons between urination and oral sex, followed by explicit descriptions of pornography viewed by the hosts, including detailed accounts of blowjobs.  A story about a friend's porn party and the unwitting participation of an unsuspecting date follows, escalating into further graphic descriptions of pornography and a segment where the hosts watch a pornographic video on air.  The conversation shifts to Mike Tyson's documentary, including detailed descriptions of his fighting style and violent personality.  The discussion moves to the UFC, focusing on the cancelled Brock Lesnar vs. Fedor Emelianenko fight and promotional complexities.  The segment concludes with a discussion of Colorado gun laws, prompted by Rogan's move, and a backstage interview with geriatric stripper Sandy Cain, who performs explicit acts on the show for money, with details of her interactions with SiriusXM staff. Joe Rogan and Dana White (via phone) are guests throughout this segment.


A phone interview with UFC President Dana White follows, covering UFC business dealings, including failed negotiations with Fedor Emelianenko and issues with Affliction MMA; the Josh Barnett steroid controversies; the reconciliation between Dana White and Tito Ortiz; and an upcoming UFC event. White discusses the challenges of securing fights, particularly with Fedor's management, his reconciliation with Tito Ortiz, and Josh Barnett's failed steroid tests.  He recounts a bizarre incident involving a supplement causing 24-hour erections and mentions a planned base jump if UFC 100 exceeds 1.5 million pay-per-views. The segment also includes the news of Kimbo Slice joining The Ultimate Fighter and a lengthy, graphic discussion about a large genital wart belonging to a crew member, culminating in a studio guest smelling the wart via a Q-tip.  The show concludes with further discussion of the upcoming UFC event and Brock Lesnar's lifestyle. Joe Rogan and Jim Norton are in studio, among other guests.


This segment begins with a bizarre sequence of events centered around Jim Jefferies' vomit, culminating in E-Rock smelling it.  The conversation then shifts to the smell of Jim Norton's belly button after ejaculation, with several individuals compelled to smell it. Norton describes the smell in detail.  Former Washington D.C. mayor Marion Barry unexpectedly enters the studio, discussing his career and infamous crack cocaine arrest, attributing it to an FBI setup, and promoting his HBO special.  His handlers briefly attempt to remove him.  The conversation returns to sexually explicit topics, including detailed discussions of female genitalia, personal hygiene, and sexual preferences, with anecdotes about vaginal odors and body hair preferences.  Devin and a relative of Devin, whose father acted in an X-rated film, briefly appear. A former child actor from *Home Alone* also appears, discussing his experiences with Michael Jackson. The segment concludes with continued vulgar banter and sexually explicit discussion.


The final segment is dominated by graphic sexual topics, including detailed accounts of sexual acts, preferences, and experiences.  The hosts and a guest engage in vulgar and sexually explicit banter, covering a woman on her period, bodily fluids, the legality of filming pornography in New York, a critique of Eliot Spitzer’s post-political career, condom use and removal, oral sex practices, anal sex cleanliness standards, the possibility of interviewing a Craigslist hooker, and speculation about Condoleezza Rice's relationship status and virginity. Joe Rogan’s appearance at the Helium Comedy Club and UFC 101 is mentioned, and Jim Jefferies promotes his shows.  A documentary called "Courting Condi" is also briefly mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  And we're off! And running!  The Friday edition of the Opie and Anthony Show has begun.  We're on, alright.  Breaking news.  Anthony and I, and little Jimmy Norton,  will not be part of the big BCN celebration they're having for the next four days.  No, huh?  You know, were they not mentioning the show at all?  Oh, no, listen to this. 
[00:00:30]  Why would we be?  So, we were on regular radio.  We were working for BCN.  We worked for BCN off and on for years.  Yeah.  We were a part of WBCN, a rock station that's going away up there in Boston.  They're going to an all-sports format starting the 13th, I guess.  Give them a little plug, because they're going to need it.  Good luck, bro.  The Boston Globe has an article today  talking about how they're bringing everyone back 
[00:01:00]  for a big four-day celebration.  Everyone.  Everyone.  Everyone!  Everyone!  Everyone!  Now, you already know that we're not invited.  There's pretty much only one other person that's not invited  to the big WBCN celebration that's happening for the next four days.  Does anybody want to guess?  Oh, no.  Anybody!  We're in the same category.  Are we in the same category?  Raise your hand!  Raise your hand!  Oh, wow. 
[00:01:30]  So, it's us.  And people wonder why we bitch and complain and get frustrated.  And all we ask for is a little respect.  A little respect.  Us and convicted child molester, Mark Parenteau.  We're the only ones.  That's good.  You nailed it.  Give yourself a fucking bell.  We're the same as convicted child molester.  I just read that.  A Google alert just pops literally on the way over to work today.  Not that this is at work. 
[00:02:00]  Did it say that the show wasn't invited specifically,  or just there was no invite?  Yeah, they missed all of our invites.  We missed them in the mail.  We must have missed them.  Parenteau's not the only person excluded.  Oh, wait.  Okay, also Peter Wolfe.  So, Peter Wolfe must have did something horrific to the radio station.  What did Peter Wolfe do?  Like, yeah, he was there for three seconds?  I don't know.  So, it's Mark Parenteau, who was convicted and went to jail for some naughty behavior.  Naughty boy giving away those Xboxes for ass.  Peter Wolfe probably because he was the biggest Boston disappointment in music history. 
[00:02:30]  I think they were expecting a lot more from Peter Wolfe, and it just didn't happen.  He was the Boston version of David Lee Roth taking over at K-Rock kind of a thing.  Right.  You know, oh, well, he's in a band.  He must have done.  And Opie and Anthony.  But the thing is, we were back on BCN, like, not long ago.  It's not like, well, you haven't been on since then.  And we were doing very well when they yanked the show.  Yeah.  Were we destroying? 
[00:03:00]  Were we setting the world on fire?  No.  No.  We keep it pretty honest here.  But we were doing very well.  Well enough that they should have been making some nice money off the radio show.  Oh, I'm sure they were.  Yeah.  And you know what I always think of when we get shafted and dicked like this is when we  get the gig, you walk up and they bring us in the room with the entire staff that works  there and everybody goes, hey, remember those? 
[00:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  They're all happy.  We walk into the conference room and everyone claps and then you sit down and it's like,  oh, ladies and gentlemen, we're very happy to have as our new morning show, Opie and  Anthony.  Here they are.  We walk in the conference room, hi, and we wave to everybody and it's all awkward and  stupid because we know it's just going to end with us being disavowed.  Of course.  Any knowledge of our actions.  They just fucking.  The AF did the same thing to us when they had their big history fucking thing in the  Rolling Stone, was it? 
[00:04:00]  Somewhere.  I forgot now.  Oh, it wasn't even Rolling Stone.  I think it might have been a radio rag.  Radio rag.  No, it's Mike's thing.  Mike?  FMQB.  Yeah.  FMQB did a whole retrospective, excuse me, of WAAF and we pretty much took that station  from what was known as a local shitty Worcester station and put it in the forefront of Boston  radio. 
[00:04:30]  That's a fact.  I mean, I'm the last guy that pats ourselves on the back.  I'm pretty much, I'm pretty humble when it comes to the show.  I always think we could probably do better kind of a thing, you know, but we absolutely  did that and got no attention for it.  We were the first radio show to beat BCN.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We beat their afternoon guy.  Oh, which was, I guess, Mark Perrano at the time, I think.  Well, the demo was different.  He was a little busy.  He was a little distracted. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  So they're not officially giving us the win.  His demo was eight to ten.  Eight to ten that have a single parent at home.  Yeah.  Strangely, his demo was the same as his hours.  And his sentence.  So what is it?  Like, what?  I don't understand what the purpose of them.  Dude, it's.  I don't get that.  Yeah, yeah.  What is that?  I don't care.  I wouldn't want to go on it anyway.  I wouldn't fucking go.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  Fuck.  It's not.  I don't even think it's about going because Howard's going to be part of it. 
[00:05:30]  But Howard's not leaving his.  No.  You know, how many week vacation is he on this time?  I don't even know.  It's going to be a tape.  He's not going to be leaving, you know, vacation in the Hamptons to go up there live.  So I'm sure.  Yeah.  Like Ann said, they're going to roll some tape of Howard Stern.  Mississippi Fats is going to be there.  Oh, you got the article now?  I have no idea who that is.  Dude, look at these names.  Look at these names.  Nick Carter's going to be there.  Look at these names.  Were we the number one personality of all time for WBCN? 
[00:06:00]  Once again.  Yes.  Absolutely not.  Nothing.  But we made more of an imprint than a lot of those names.  Read some of the names that are going to be at the BCN four-day tribute.  Ken Shelton.  Ken Shelton.  Of course, Howard.  He has to be there, yeah.  Billy West.  Mm-hmm.  Stephen Clean.  Albert O.  Bradley J.  We know some of these names.  James Montgomery.  Sam Copper.  Mississippi Fats. 
[00:06:30]  Ray.  Ray, Ray, Ray.  Well, you could call him Ray.  You could call him Jay.  You could call him Johnny.  You could call him Johnny.  Max Ann.  Satari.  Shred.  Mark Hamilton.  Hamilton.  Bill Abbot A.  Dickie Barrett of the Mighty Mighty Boss Tones.  Who only started working for them very recently.  Greg Hawks of the Cars. 
[00:07:00]  Robin Young.  Robin Young.  Carter Allen.  Oedipus.  Of course.  Jerry Goodwin.  Stephen Nelson.  Nick Carter.  Tammy Hyde.  Chachi.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Jay Leno.  Who put the list together?  Well, yeah.  I guess Leno started.  Stephen Strick.  Well, I'm sure someone that.  Tony Baradini.  Good old Tony.  Remember Tony?  Among others.  And among others.  Opie and Anthony.  We're in the excluded list. 
[00:07:30]  Why?  It's Peter Wolfe.  Mark Perretto.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  And one more name.  Matt Siegel.  But he's the competition.  And that's the only reason that he's not going to be part of the celebration.  The station had no comment yesterday, but it's likely that Perretto's part, past legal  troubles, are the reason he's persona non grata.  Yeah.  You think?  And then do they say why we are?  They don't even speculate as to why we are.  Well, just to make it official, too, Mark Perretto, in 2004, he was convicted of one count 
[00:08:00]  of child sexual abuse involving a 14-year-old boy and sentenced to three years in prison.  How many years in prison?  I did three.  Oh, you did three.  But it doesn't explain why we're not invited.  But it doesn't even say why we're not on.  You know, for once in our careers, too, we didn't motherfuck them on the way out, either.  No.  We just kind of, like, bit our lips real hard and said, fuck those fuckers.  They actually explain why Mark Perretto isn't on there.  But our departure was more ghastly than fucking a young boy. 
[00:08:30]  I was not.  Well, no.  And this is why we bitch and complain.  So the next time you hear us bitching and complaining, this is why.  Because we get no respect to this business.  We never have, and we never will.  But it's almost like who would want to be a part of it?  It's like the station's not even dying.  It's being killed.  So you're going to watch a murder, an execution, because of fucking upper management beyond BCN's magic. 
[00:09:00]  Which has done a terrible job.  But that's not even the point.  Yeah, I know.  You know, you want to at least, you know, be listed.  It doesn't bother me that we're not a part of it in the end.  All the bullshit from fucking upper management and that, hey, we're happy to have you, all that, all that is just bullshit.  Well, before we got fired for the Sex for Sam thing, we made them a shitload of money, and we had unbelievable ratings. 
[00:09:30]  When we came back, the ratings weren't as good, but the world changed.  That's my opinion.  You could argue whatever you want on some dumb hater board for hours, if you like.  But I think the world changed, and our ratings just weren't as high, but we still were successful.  Yeah.  Still were successful.  Absolutely.  And they chose to, you know, not renew our contract, even though we were still doing our jobs and getting the job done as far as ratings go.  So it wasn't like we did anything horrible to this company or this radio station. 
[00:10:00]  Are they taking touch with Richard Dunn there, or are they keeping him on in the morning?  I don't know.  I barely follow this whole thing anymore.  I mean, this is on my radar just because it was a Google alert.  I mean, we did a comedy show up there that did unbelievably well.  We have a lot of fans up in the Boston area, and they just don't even want to acknowledge that we were ever part of the radio station.  Even Charles Laquadera was saying that Mark Pereno is a huge—Mark is one of the key figures, and we're not allowed to mention him. 
[00:10:30]  His name's been wiped out, said Laquadera, who hosted the big mattress.  I feel like a whore and a hypocrite doing the farewell because it's not being handled in the BCN spirit.  After 40 years, the station is about to go all sports format. 
[00:11:00]  But before that happens, virtually everyone with a connection to BCN is participating in the long goodbye.  So he's defending the man who put his cock in a boy's asshole for PlayStation.  But no mention of the Opie and Anthony show and why we're not there.  We were never really part of the BCN crowd.  Like, they—I don't know. 
[00:11:30]  They just thought a lot differently than us.  But we still were part of the station, and we're very successful.  We were more of an impact as the enemy than we were as their friend, is what it was.  I mean, Mark Perrano was a huge deal for many years up there.  We were the ones that knocked him off.  We were the ones that beat him.  Charles Laquadera needs to relax, though.  When a guy fucks a kid in the ass, you know what?  That takes away radio fucking celebration integrity.  Maybe he shouldn't be invited to the party.  Great party!  He's there kneeling in a pig mask in front of a small black child. 
[00:12:00]  But you know what?  Charles Laquadera—didn't we used to call him Charles Lack of Talent?  Lack of Talent, yes.  Charles should not do it, then.  Why is he doing it?  Yeah, then why is he doing it?  Why are you doing it?  He feels like a big hypocrite, but he'll, you know, drink the punch and—  Of course he will.  Fucking—  If you feel so strongly about this, you should not participate.  Wax fantastic over the old days.  And I don't even know—wow.  I mean, we didn't even get the phone call. 
[00:12:30]  I would have just said, yeah, play a couple of our cool bits we did while we were in Boston,  and that's it, as a look back.  Like, yeah, there won't even be a mention, a clip.  Isn't that just amazing?  Nothing.  Isn't that amazing?  And did we explain the AAF thing?  So AAF, they decided—yeah, they did a whole history thing, because we didn't finish that story.  Yeah.  And they literally did not mention us once.  And we were the biggest thing ever to come out of AAF.  That was amazing.  It was like Stalinism. 
[00:13:00]  That was Dave Douglas, who was holding some weird grudge.  Weird grudge?  Well, we fucking bashed the shit out of them.  Well, just because we thought—you know.  But that's no reason to rewrite history or leave out a part of history.  We were a major, if not the biggest part of WAF and their history.  We brought them, like I said, from fucking—a local yokel shit Worcester fucking station,  where when they talked about we're going to be in the city tonight, they meant Worcester.  And brought them into the forefront of Boston Radio and under the tutelage of the fidget GM. 
[00:13:30]  B-b-b-boys.  We did three years for AAF, and they don't acknowledge us anymore.  And we did four to five, I think, for BCN.  Yeah.  Because it's a little weird, because then we were doing stuff before they hired us full-time.  Whatever.  So now, officially, we've never worked in Boston Radio, Aaron.  Congratulations.  Yeah, that's true.  We never even fucking worked there.  Yeah, we didn't— 
[00:14:00]  We didn't make no impact in Boston Radio.  Never happened.  It never happened.  Now, do you understand why this business just sucks?  God.  It just sucks.  I like talking to the people.  I like hanging out with you guys.  But the business is just ridiculous.  Stone cold shopping.  Yeah, it is.  The business sucks.  Wow.  It's—  Management is a bunch of fucking dickheads in radio. 
[00:14:30]  It's amazing.  Oh, God.  I would love to know their reasoning.  Who can we call?  I don't even know who I would want to call.  What would the reasoning be that they're not—  Yeah.  That we're not part of that?  Don't you have Oedipus's number?  Yeah, but he's like—  Call up Oedipus's.  He got fired years ago.  Yeah, I know, but he might have an insight.  It's not a bad idea.  I haven't talked to him in a while, but—  Yeah.  Give him a little text.  Say, well, nice to see we're welcome.  You know, make it kind of funny.  Yeah, I will.  So, there you go. 
[00:15:00]  Unbelievable.  So, that explains that Google alert that some people might have got today.  That's fantastic.  You know, good.  And they explain why Mark Perrano's not part of it, but they don't explain why we're not part of it.  What could that be?  It doesn't make sense.  Because the last exit was not—if it was right after Sex or Sam, it's like, all right, but there was no negative shit after the last one.  It makes sense.  They ended up rehiring us after the Sex or Sam thing, so they were over that.  Yeah.  Wow.  And, you know, them letting us go, firing us, whatever you want to call it, it was a normal letting-go-firing thing. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  You know, we weren't happy about it, but most of those people coming back were let go or fired.  Yeah.  So, we're just one of the many that were let go or fired.  That's what happens in radio.  So, why wouldn't we be invited back to say, hey?  Yeah, all those people weren't working there.  Yeah, we're not expecting a—  So, what did they do?  We're not expecting an hour-long commercial-free Opie and Anthony tribute, but—  Yeah, thanks.  Maybe a couple minutes, like, hey, guys, you know, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:16:00]  But a mention.  I wouldn't wish the news station any luck or nothing, but it would be nice to say hey to some old listeners that never got the satellite after we left.  What a phony goodbye that is, though, because CBS is killing the station.  It's just—they're making a conscious decision to do it.  Gotta blow it up, yep.  And everyone's acting like it's this sad occasion.  I mean, it is for the people you like there.  They're painting the walls with thermite paint.  Oh, wait.  You're—I mean, no offense, but I think you're a little confused.  Like, corporate? 
[00:16:30]  They don't give a shit that they're giving a—  Oh, no, I know.  Oh, okay.  That's what I mean.  All right.  They don't give a shit they're doing a four-day goodbye thing.  Somebody in the BCN history said, wow, we really need to say goodbye, and they're like, hey, all right.  Yeah, here's four days.  Whatever.  Do whatever you want.  They don't give a shit.  They can't wait to repaint that place and get a new logo going.  Oh, yeah.  That's how it works in radio.  They don't understand heritage or history of a radio station anymore.  They don't care.  Obviously.  They don't give a shit. 
[00:17:00]  They want to make sure that we're not part of it.  And a child, quote, do you call him a molester?  What do you call him?  Was he convicted for child molesting?  Yes.  Yes, he was.  All right.  So.  Fucking child—a convicted child molester.  That's what—that's who we run with.  You don't even have to say alleged.  He was a convicted child molester.  Why don't you go to jail for it?  That's who we fucking—yeah.  This is—that's who we run with.  That's—they equate us with that.  We're equal to a child molester in the corporate world. 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  And right now he's going, I understand, but, I mean, why with them?  I mean, do you think he's paying this for Perano saying?  Even Perano's going, look, I understand why my invite didn't come in the mail.  I wouldn't—  I come in the mail.  The young mail.  But, you know, O&A.  Come on now.  So, I mean, there's no surprise, but—  That is surprising.  It's very funny.  Like, the only other person.  Yeah, that's a great line. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, God.  It's—we're not—  It's okay.  We're not surprised, but we like to just point this out to the listeners, because they—a  bunch of people, you know, think we bitch a lot.  I think our bitching is way down, but we like to show you where all this anger comes from.  Why don't I just call Chachi?  Yeah, Chachi.  Half those people, they never—they barely did anything with their Boston radio careers.  Barely anything.  We made a much bigger mark than, I would say, three-quarters of those names. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Three-quarters.  John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy would have been there, but they're dead.  Right.  Motherfuckers.  I know.  Albert DeSalvo was trying to show up.  Yeah.  He's cordially invited.  Yeah.  Charles Stewart got the invite, and they're like, oh, no.  So they just threw it off the bridge.  Shaken Monkey Syndrome writes, be fair.  If I saw Anthony's shooting range videos, I'd be damned if I would invite him either.  Oh, well, I'm perfectly safe. 
[00:19:00]  Let's go to Bill in Washington.  Bill.  Oh, Bill.  Hey.  Bill in Boston.  Sorry.  Hey, Anthony.  What's up, man?  Anthony, you are a true patriot.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you.  And I just want to tell you that Peter Wolfe was a night DJ there long before he was ever  in the J. Giles band.  Yeah.  No, I understand Peter Wolfe's part in this.  So why isn't Peter Wolfe part of it?  Because, I mean, he was probably one of the original, maybe not one of the original DJs,  but he was one of the more important ones. 
[00:19:30]  Peter Wolfe is a real motherfucker.  Really?  He doesn't do anything but for large amounts of money.  Oh, so maybe, okay, maybe he wanted something in return.  No wonder you don't see him doing anything anymore.  And maybe they said, to heck with this guy, forget it, fudge.  Right.  Sorry about that.  Jimmy, you rule.  Thank you, sir.  Not according to Boston Radio, I don't.  Well, hey, I was up at the set of Furry Vengeance the other day.  What are you doing there?  Doing work for the catering company.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, everybody's pretty nice up there.  But I was looking for you.  I never saw you. 
[00:20:00]  I was probably in my little trailer.  How do you like that?  Nice fairgrounds.  It's all right.  I mean, you know, it's where they had the base campus of the fairground.  Oh, yeah.  It was nice.  That's the best thing around here in the fall.  It's pretty sad, huh?  Yeah, it certainly is.  All right, Bill.  Have a good weekend, guys.  Thanks, Bill.  Let's say hi to Sonny Ferrelli.  Of course, Sonny Ferrelli.  What's up, Sonny?  Hey, guys.  You guys kind of stole my thunder a little bit when you talked about child fucker  Derek.  I think I kind of woke up a little late. 
[00:20:30]  What happened, Sonny?  Don't kick yourself.  But anyways, I mean, I'm really sad about the fact that WBCN is kind of like switching  over.  I mean, you know, I'm coming up on my 40s myself.  You sure are.  Jesus.  I thought you were pushing 60.  You know, and I remember listening to Child Blackwood Era in the morning, and it just  happened to be a staple of Warfront in Boston here for such a long time.  But it's kind of sad to see him go.  Well, you know what?  It's like they say.  I mean, it's just these things that you can't control. 
[00:21:00]  Or any other cliches.  Happen.  You move on.  That's right.  Que sera, sera.  That's right.  Well, I mean, there's a lot of people here, though.  There's a lot of people here, though, that are really stupid to say that.  Over it, though.  You know?  Well, Sonny, you really are falling apart here.  Sonny, pull it together.  Yeah.  Bite your lip and move on.  Jesus.  Sonny Corleone handled the causeway better than you're handling this.  God almighty.  You can get a grip on yourself, man.  It's embarrassing.  All right.  I'm pushing the fucking button. 
[00:21:30]  Space truckers say we should crash the party.  I don't even know if it's a party.  I think if they just are coming and going.  Yeah, what is it?  Saying goodbye.  Well, no, in corporate, they're making everyone pre-tape their stuff.  Oh, yeah.  God forbid there's any spontaneity that might lead to somebody saying something bad about BCN going away.  Yeah, that would be terrible.  I agree.  Somebody wants us to.  Well, Brian in Philly has a suggestion. 
[00:22:00]  Brian in Philly.  Brian.  Hey, good morning, boys.  How you doing?  I was wondering if we could Google bomb WBCN honors KidToucher.  Google bomb?  Google.  WBCN honors KidToucher.  Well, they're not, though.  I know.  They're not honoring him.  Yeah, they're not honoring him.  I mean, I like your thought, but they're actually telling him to stay home.  ONA as bad as KidToucher?  Oh, yeah.  Question mark.  Opie and Anthony touch kids? 
[00:22:30]  Question mark.  That's pretty funny.  Why is that, though?  That's so weird.  Well, you know, they're innocent of that age.  You really?  Oh, no.  Jimmy.  James.  We meant the other thing.  All right.  Well, I figured we'd bring that to your attention today.  Why?  Oh, the whole thing's a bunch of bunk, if you ask my opinion.  It's a bunch of bunk.  Okay, regular Jim.  Oh, God.  It would be nice to see Oedipus.  I like Oedipus.  And, you know, because Chachi I've seen. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  But Oedipus I liked a lot, man.  Oedipus was all right.  Yeah, he was very nice to me.  We will.  I'm sure we will hear from somebody as to why we were excluded, along with a convicted  child molester.  Maybe Steve could call Toucher and Rich.  Someone suggested we go on the air with Toucher and Rich.  They're not going to let Toucher and Rich have us on the air.  Probably not.  But maybe Toucher and Rich could, like, at least try to find out who made the list or  who, you know, sent out the invites.  That was Parento before he went to prison. 
[00:23:30]  Toucher and Rich.  Because he had a lot of money.  Jimmy James.  Jimmy James.  That's pretty funny.  I like it.  Hello, Jimmy James.  Good evening.  Hey, it's got to be that Downs patient, Marble Mouth Menino, trying to keep you out of  Boston.  You know what, though?  Maybe, but they were back on the air.  We were all back on the air recently.  It's not like it doesn't make sense.  Have you ever heard anything he said? 
[00:24:00]  None of it makes sense, Jim.  That's a good point.  Man is a mush-mouthed boob.  Gavin.  You know, boys.  All right.  Gavin's got the worst possible fucking reason ever.  Gavin.  Welcome aboard, Gav.  Tell everybody the worst possible scenario as to why we're not invited, and I'll tell  you why.  Gavin!  Yeah.  The reason why is they just don't want to acknowledge satellite radio.  That's why they're putting the guy that got the most publicity ever for going to satellite 
[00:24:30]  radio.  He'll be on.  But we won't be.  Can you please explain that?  I don't know.  They just don't want to acknowledge satellite radio.  Again, again.  Gavin, Gavin.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Listen to Anthony's logic.  Please.  Howard Stern is going to be on, and he is probably the biggest story that was ever on satellite 
[00:25:00]  radio, and he is on satellite radio, making a lot of money on satellite radio.  Why, then, would we not be on because we're on satellite?  Go.  You're better.  No, you know, can I?  No, you can't fall apart like that, Gavin.  You just came apart at the seams.  You really got a gun, you panty waist.  Oh, Jesus.  Don't go ahead.  And ask Kiss isn't going to help in this situation.  Gavin, hang in there.  Come on.  But I don't know if that's it, but you know what?  I did think that, but it was almost like to invite Stern, it's like, they can't not. 
[00:25:30]  He was so, such a massive part of that station for so many fucking years.  It's almost too glaring to not.  Yeah, yeah, perhaps, but I mean.  Yeah, there's no argument there.  But then it takes away the excuse like, well, they're on satellite.  Right, exactly.  If you have one guy in satellite, it doesn't matter.  I don't think, yeah.  Right.  I don't know.  With everybody, you know, if they show Howard and you guys both. 
[00:26:00]  Don't take Jimmy's fucking thing.  You didn't come up with this.  Yeah, you really are.  Now you're just taking what Jimmy said.  You're just reiterating now.  I did think that, but I don't know.  Yeah, Gavin, really.  Let's just agree to agree, but not acknowledge each other.  Let's agree that you're an ass.  Yeah, Gavin, please, you're humiliating yourself and me.  All right.  Do me a favor, Chezzy.  Stay off my side.  Okay.  Don't kick your dad in the balls for having you.  You want to explain to Steve why his reason is bad, too? 
[00:26:30]  All right.  Steve in Rhode Island.  Because I can't eat as much as O.  Yeah, knowing how it's done, the douchebag probably said,  I don't want Open Anthony there.  Probably a contract he wrote up.  Ah, well, that would be good if you put it on the tape.  That'll play when he's.  Been following you guys for years.  You guys are the best.  But we work for the same company as Howard, so that makes it a little.  Yeah, I don't think that's it.  Hey, Norton.  Yeah.  Norton.  I'm too good, sir. 
[00:27:00]  And then he hangs up like, I got him.  Yeah, he's right now.  I got him.  Right now, he's listening to the replay,  and his head is hung in the shame that it should be hung in  to try to get a man of my character.  Of course.  It was so obvious.  Well, enough of that, man of my ilk.  Enough of that.  Well, we lost John Hughes, man.  2009, the year of the celebrity death continues.  What?  Poor guy.  Yeah, John Hughes.  Do we know where he had the heart attack?  Somewhere in New York.  Just walk him.  He was strolling in the park one day. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, that's apparently what it was.  Central Park?  I think it was in Central Park.  That's what I read.  59.  Is it creepy to want to know exactly where he dropped?  Why?  Look for fucking flowers in that stupid cross that people put up.  Yeah, and a copy of Ferris Bueller with tears on it.  He was in New York visiting relatives, 59 years old.  Yeah.  And he wasn't even jogging.  They're saying he was walking.  A director dies.  He was walking and had a massive heart attack, 
[00:28:00]  and we lost John Hughes.  Yep.  And, man, you forget.  You really do forget.  Don't lose him.  They found him right there where he fell.  Well, he means that he passed away.  Oh, literal Jim.  Oh, sorry.  There it is.  They just showed it on CNN.  I don't think anyone.  What?  He thought he's dead.  Oh.  I don't think anyone had a better decade than John Hughes.  The 80s?  The 80s.  Of course.  Listen to this.  I'll run down this real fast.  He wrote Mr. Mom.  Mr. Mom was very funny. 
[00:28:30]  1983.  So he's 83.  He writes Mr. Mom, okay?  Mm-hmm.  He writes Vacation in the same year.  83.  He writes and directs 16 Candles in 84.  That's a hell of a start right there.  Yeah, yeah.  85, he writes and directs Weird Science.  Jesus.  Also in 85, he wrote European Vacation,  and he wrote, produced, and directed The Breakfast Club.  Why didn't he grow up, though?  That is true. 
[00:29:00]  Christ almighty.  All right, we get it.  You like kids.  Oh, look.  They just showed Jimmy's pal, Anthony Michael Hall.  I was actually just thinking of him.  Yeah.  Were you?  Your friends.  Sexually?  Let's get him on the air to talk about this.  Oh, boy.  He was in a few.  Yes, he knew him.  Let's show you him up.  He was in a few.  And we have Devin coming in as well.  Yeah, Devin from Home Alone, the older brother,  is coming in to talk about John Hughes.  Oh, my God.  But 1985, he did Weird Science, European Vacation,  and The Breakfast Club.  That's a hell of a year.  Then 86, he writes, produces, and directs Ferris Bueller's Day Off. 
[00:29:30]  Little movie.  Little movie.  Yeah.  But that same year, he also, you know,  executive produced and wrote Pretty in Pink.  Wow.  Jesus.  You know who he reminds me of in a way,  but even more successful, fucking Apatow.  Like that kind of a career where every movie the guy makes  is a fucking massive talk about movie.  Very similar, too, because Apatow writes some of these movies,  directs some of these movies, produces some of these movies.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  He has a hand in a lot of the comedies that we all know and love nowadays. 
[00:30:00]  So then Pretty in Pink, I said that right,  Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.  He freaking...  I can't believe that one.  Writes, produces, and directs.  Wow.  Some kind of wonderful the same year he writes and produces.  88, The Great Outdoors.  She's Having a Baby.  Boo!  Boo!  A little bit of a drop.  No one knows those.  A little bit of a drop-off, but you can't blame the guy.  What a bum, boo!  He had a hell of a decade leading up to that.  Fuck him!  Sizemore Arrested.  Oh, well. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, I think we got the audio.  He's back in the news.  And then he ends the decade with Christmas Vacation and Uncle Buck.  Oh, all right.  Right back.  Holy shit.  And then he moves into the 90s with Home Alone,  and it goes on from there, obviously.  Jesus, that guy directed a lot of big movies.  Is that amazing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he had a great mullet, too.  You have to love fucking John Hughes.  Yeah, big mullet.  Oh, my.  Look at him behind you guys on that fox.  Oh, yeah.  That motherfucker had a mullet.  Yeah, he rocked the mullet.  John Hughes rocked the mullet.  Well, it was all about the 80s for him, 
[00:31:00]  so he might as well have just stayed there with the hair and everything.  But, you know, they're not showing a recent picture of the guy.  What did he look like?  I don't know.  They're showing the mullet pictures.  He couldn't possibly have a mullet in the year 2009.  If I directed all those big hits,  I'd wear a fucking Colosby bag on my head and say,  what do you got to say about that?  And no one would say nothing.  You know, Dice knew him, obviously.  I don't know how well he knew him, but he was in Pretty in Pink.  Or was he in, yeah, he was in Pretty in Pink.  Was he?  Mm-hmm.  Was Dice in Pretty in Pink?  Dice wasn't in Pretty in Pink. 
[00:31:30]  Was that the one he was in?  He played Vinny the door guy.  I'm sure Kenny is scrambling to get to the mic right now to correct me or agree with me.  But he's too busy fetching something.  I don't remember Dice being in there.  He was the door guy.  He was, like, smoking.  I think he put the cigarette around his head.  He did some silly shit.  He was the door guy.  Kenny just woke up.  Was it my right, Kenny?  Yeah.  What's the question?  Which John Hughes movie was Andrew Dice Clay in?  Pretty in Pink.  Wow, good call, Jimmy.  I don't remember this.  He was in Pretty in Pink. 
[00:32:00]  As the door guy.  Get the clip.  I'm sure you could find the clip there, Dan.  You stumped me on that one, James.  All right.  Well, you obviously have undertaker work to do, judging by your coat.  I don't know what to...  I know.  I'm so sorry.  Why are you smiling, then?  You only break that suit out for a week.  What are you doing?  It's terrible.  It's a black suit.  It's in rotation.  Who are you going out with?  The fucking guy from Poltergeist 2?  God is in his holy temple.  This is the dice scene. 
[00:32:30]  If you want to...  Sure.  Okay.  So how many times have you let me in?  I never let you in.  You know that.  You see what I'm saying?  Oh, yes.  I don't know.  What are you saying?  You see what I'm saying?  It's like helium.  I never let you in.  Wow, the dice were a full head of hair.  Look at the young dice.  That's creepy.  Yeah.  No, I don't let you in.  I don't know.  But where's the clip with the real voice?  Why don't we get the young dice?  Yeah, why don't we have to get the older dice?  Where was the young dice?  I mean, we've been around long enough that we should have got a piece of the young dice, 
[00:33:00]  don't you think?  All right, now we got it.  Okay, so you know, we're buddies.  We're close, right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Very powerful.  Okay, so how many times have you let me in?  I never let you in.  You know that.  So you see what I'm saying?  I don't know what he's saying.  What I'm saying is my girlfriend is in there, and I'm out here.  Well, she's a girl, and she's my friend, so she's a girlfriend.  But she's in there, and I'm out here.  I mean, you're a sensitive, sexually potent kind of guy.  You've got to know how that hurts.  Well, let me ask you a question, seriously.  Why does she come here knowing I don't let you in? 
[00:33:30]  Huh?  Think about it.  I don't know.  All right, my advice to you is, uh, dump her.  Loser.  You don't need that.  You see what I'm saying?  You see the point I'm trying to make?  Love's a bitch, duck.  Love's a bitch.  Ain't it the truth?  Oh, it's the truth.  High five.  All right.  Go for it.  Look at the young dice.  Come on.  Oh, the baby, the baby.  Hey, honey, honey, let me ask you a personal question. 
[00:34:00]  If you worship the duck, why don't you hang out somewhere he could get in?  I'm a dice man.  Oh, you call him Dice Man?  Okay, he's using Dice Man.  Can I?  Oh, fuck, Levy's on, oh.  Fucking Levy is on PX11.  Sorry.  I fucking never saw Bob on TV.  And all the t-shirts.  You're not supposed to laugh at him.  I love Levy.  Bob Levy.  I'm fucking, I'm so happy Bob's on TV.  Oh, he needs a dye job, you fucking old man. 
[00:34:30]  Dye your hair.  You prick.  ACDC on television.  I'm telling you, I'm just gonna rock and roll.  Let the fucking spit on Levy.  Oh, I'm fucking happy for him.  I know he's gonna blow it off.  He's gonna say something stupid.  Dude, can we please, can somebody record this?  I have to see Bob working clean on television.  How is he gonna do it?  Yeah, really.  The guy's gonna get it down the hall.  Please take this.  Was that scene actually in the movie?  Yeah, of course it was.  I remember it.  Yeah.  It absolutely was in the movie.  Yeah, after seeing it, now I remember it.  Yeah.  I guess I haven't seen Pretty in Pink in a long time then.  I remember that from before I, after I knew Andrew. 
[00:35:00]  I have no recollection of that fucking scene in Pretty in Pink.  Right before, I think not long before we broke.  It was not long before.  Yeah.  And he's using an episode of MASH, which I remember from 83, but I realized that after  very numerous, that's all right.  Dice was on different strokes?  Yep.  He played, he played, did he play the Gooch or no?  Yes, I'm listening, but you're not saying much.  Good morning.  Good morning, Arnold.  You hungry?  This is the parental clip. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  The parental clip, yeah.  Yeah, pop around to find Dice, because this could be, this is like a seven minute clip.  I want to have some laughs, Hope.  Conrad Bain.  Good old Conrad.  He knew comedy, that guy.  Yes, I know I have a couple, but none of them stole it.  Booger Couch is pointing out that that clip of Dice was before he became a Megatron star  with extra talent.  Oh, that's Dice.  Wow.  Look at Dice.  What is he doing?  Dice in the hallway of the school. 
[00:36:00]  Hey, Larry, what are you doing?  That's my locker.  Give me the key.  Hey, as of now, this lock is mine.  Beat it, Billy.  He's being John Travolta.  You give me the key and take your stuff out of there.  Why don't we settle it right now?  Come on, man.  Let's go.  Hey, wait a minute.  Can I talk to you guys for a second?  Who is this turkey?  The name's Willis Jackson.  Willis Jackson.  So what?  Well, I just couldn't help but overhearing a little disagreement. 
[00:36:30]  No disagreement.  It's my locker.  It's not you a locker.  It's my locker.  It was an extra locker in the first place.  Now go find yourself another one.  Somebody's going to get an extra nose.  Go ahead.  What does that mean?  Hey, wait a minute.  I don't know.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Extra nose.  There must be a peaceful solution to this problem.  It just calls for a little give and take.  Right.  You give me the key or I take you apart.  The last thing you need is for the principal to find out you're both fighting over a lotter. 
[00:37:00]  The last thing you need is for the principal to find out you're both fighting over a lotter.  He doesn't look like a student.  No, he looks 38.  He looks way too old.  Yeah, why is he a student there?  He's the only one with big adult sideburns.  Sideburns.  I'm in school.  That was well acted.  Oh.  I'll make an observation. 
[00:37:30]  Oops.  Oops.  It stinks.  It does need a little work.  You know, why don't you like butt out?  You're stopping a good fight here.  Does that have a rat tail shoved down the back of his jacket?  Guys, wait.  Guys, listen.  I'm sure I can come up with a solution, but it's going to take time.  I mean, I'm no genius.  We already figured that out.  For sure.  Good barbs being thrown around. 
[00:38:00]  Because he's...  Why don't you give him the key back just until tomorrow, and I can come up with something by then?  No way.  I already got my personal assets in this locker.  And he don't want us peeking at his coloring books.  Oh, that's harsh.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Why do they got to use that kind of talk?  Dice.  It's going to be trouble.  Whoever wrote that episode, I hope their hand was severed in a farming accident.  Like, I hope they're reaching into the lawnmower to get something, and it went...  And then fucking from the wrist down, they're just a stump and memories. 
[00:38:30]  Gone.  Yeah.  I can never type another bad joke again.  Quickly, Kenny, with the eggs.  Dice was on M.A.S.H. also.  I just said that.  Yeah.  As an injured...  Oh, okay.  I just read it.  Jimmy said that.  Well, I read it.  In 83.  You said it.  An injured soldier.  Well, I casted it.  I was a casting director back then.  Were you?  I certainly was.  I remember him.  A young Andrew.  Andy Clay.  Andy Clay, did you call him?  Yeah.  I said, you're not supposed to smoke.  You're on a stretcher.  He went, okay.  I'm injured. 
[00:39:00]  Some chink hit me with a bullet.  I did.  Yeah, that's after the Megatron Star Dice, you know.  But all this shit is pre-Megatron.  No, that was too.  Okay.  But the visual on that, he looked way too old to be in school with those kids.  And he was doing Vinny Barbarino.  I mean, come on.  Someone else mentioned that he sounded like Damone a little bit, too.  Really?  Nah.  Had a little Damone going on.  I definitely see a Vinny Barbarino thing there. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Andrew Dice Clay.  It's just Andrew Clay, I'm sure, right?  Or Andy.  Andy.  Why don't we...  Lil Andy Clay.  Why don't we take our first break?  He's a good boy.  Yeah.  I taught him how to smoke.  Welcome, Paul.  We'll break.  Yeah.  God damn, look at all these people coming in today.  It's going to be a busy one.  We got Joe Rogan at 730. 
[00:40:00]  That's huge.  We're going to be talking UFC.  We're all going down to Philly.  Are you going in?  Philly.  Are you bailing?  Are you with us?  Yeah.  Nah, I'm going.  You're going?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  It's the first time UFC's in Philly.  We're all going down there.  And also, Rogan's playing Helium Comedy Club tonight.  A bunch of us are going to check out his comedy as well.  So, it's a nice Philly weekend.  Jim Jeffery's coming back because he's in town.  He'll be here at 830.  Dana White will be calling to talk about the UFC and Fedor and the rest of the news going 
[00:40:30]  on in his world.  I'm sure he's not happy with Fedor's management.  Hell fucking no.  I know I'm not.  No.  Devin, who was in...  How many John Hughes movies was Devin in?  I don't know.  Both Home Alones.  All the Home Alones.  Let me ask you a question, too.  Marion Barry is walking around or is it Marion Barry, a different guy, is doing one of the  other shows?  I'm like, we have to get Marion.  What, here?  Yes.  Really?  Marion...  I think Kenny sent out an email.  It was Marion Barry is one of the guests.  Barry or Barry?  That's what we're trying to figure out if it was a misprint.  But who's Marion Barry, then?  It could be a singer.  Marion Barry?  Chuck's brother. 
[00:41:00]  Does his cousin even...  I just don't know.  We're going to play a clip from Breakfast Club going into break in honor of the passing  of John Hughes.  A little Judd Nelson speech from...  Oh, man.  He was a tough guy.  ...from Breakfast Club.  In that.  Good dialogue, though.  What?  Yeah, I think so.  That's it.  Listen to the words.  What are we having?  Uh, it's just your standard regular lunch, I guess.  Milk?  Soup. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, that's apple juice.  I can read.  P, B, and J with the crusts cut off.  Well, Brian, this is a very nutritious lunch.  All the food groups are represented.  Did your mom marry Mr. Rogers?  Uh, no, Mr. Johnson.  Huh.  Here's my impression of life at Big Bri's house. 
[00:42:00]  Son?  Here's my dad.  Here's my dad.  Here's my dad.  Here's my dad.  Here's my dad.  Here's my dad.  Here's my dad.  Yeah, dad.  How's your day, pal?  Great, dad.  How's yours?  Super.  Say, son, how'd you like to go?  Fishing this weekend.  Great, dad.  But I've got homework to do.  That's all right, son.  You can do it on the boat. 
[00:42:30]  Gee.  Dear, isn't our son swell?  Yes, dear.  Isn't life swell?  Thank you, man.  Check it out, the O.P. and Anthony show.  Joe Rogan will be in here in about 20 minutes. 
[00:43:00]  Very cool.  Him and his fucking Neanderthal fists.  Oh, I know.  Jesus.  His hairy knuckles.  Oh, Rogan's a problem.  Very intimidating, those hairy knuckles.  But Anthony's a little distracted, and I don't blame him.  Dominic Barber is on live right now.  He's all over the news with this Taconic crash story.  Yeah, he has picked a very, very strange case.  Yeah.  He really has.  You've got to think he just wants to be on TV or something,  because this woman on the Taconic Parkway goes the wrong way, 
[00:43:30]  comes out that her blood alcohol level was through the roof.  She had pot in her system.  0.19.  0.19.  That's massively bad.  0.19.  And then she drives the wrong way and kills eight people.  Yeah.  Eight people.  That's nice.  And now Dominic Barber has gotten involved in the case.  With the husband.  He's the husband's attorney.  Yeah.  And now the husband is not cooperating with the police investigation of this whole thing. 
[00:44:00]  Dominic, of course, I'm sure, is part of that.  And he's all over the news with his bad acting.  This is how he acts in front of a jury.  His horrible acting and fake sincerity and concern.  And it just, I've seen this.  I've seen it live.  Who's the guy he's standing with?  Who's that fucking bald guy?  Cardboard cutout?  I have no idea.  That's got to be the husband, maybe? 
[00:44:30]  No.  It doesn't look like him.  Oh, no?  No.  So, Dominic, I don't really understand what he's trying to do here.  He's, well, it's no secret that he's always loved the limelight and television.  And I think he's latched himself onto this case knowing that it's high profile and he'll get a lot of airtime.  He's taking, he's definitely taking it.  Is that Kuntzler?  No.  Kuntzler's dead.  Is it?  Oh, or the other one.  No, no, no, no.  Kubi?  No.  No, no, no, no. 
[00:45:00]  Kuntzler's dead?  William Kuntzler?  How did it happen?  Oh, it was a mercy killing.  Oh, that's Tom Ruskin.  He's an investigator.  He's an investigator, so.  Now, I'd love to hear that.  Look at Dominic's fake sincerity and.  He's acting.  Looks like he's acting.  Yeah, of course.  Poorly.  I got to hear this audio because I'm just, I'm obsessed now with exposing him.  What an insult to the dead.  Oh.  What an insult to the families of the dead.  Because now they're saying, well, she wasn't drunk. 
[00:45:30]  Or stoned.  This is what, you know, Dominic and his client there are saying.  And they want to exhume the body and have some kind of a, what is that, an independent  coroner of their own choosing.  That never works out.  Do an autopsy.  And, of course, you know, that's going to be biased.  That's what I don't understand.  I don't understand why the court system allows that.  You get an independent whatever.  Yeah.  That's associated with a case.  Now, you're hiring this independent person. 
[00:46:00]  Of course, you're hiring them expecting that they're going to do the right thing and give  you the results that you need for your case.  You know what I mean?  That's exactly what happens.  Because in some cases, you hire an independent accountant or accounting firm to look at books  and things like that and finances, things such as that.  And the independent one will always come up with a different figure than your independent  one.  Of course.  And it's math, so it should all turn out the same. 
[00:46:30]  Of course.  But it rarely does.  So, yeah, their independent coroner or something.  Look, he is in every shot.  He is the white Al Sharpton.  Just latches on like one of those shark sucker fishes that just, they go into the shark's  chin and nibble off whatever they fucking can.  That's what it is.  Smart location, too.  The shark can't bite you.  Yeah, exactly.  He has no hands.  How annoyed a shark must be that he can't get under his chin. 
[00:47:00]  He should have like a shark razor blade so he could just shave them off.  Dude, the sharks must hate that.  But then he could hold it with his fin.  Yeah, they're just dangling.  He's on my chinny-chin-chin and I can't do anything.  Imagine a little guy hanging off your chin and all you want to do is eat it.  Annoying.  Imagine a cookie hanging off your chin.  A delicious cookie.  You know it would be yummy if you could just get your fins up to it.  Oh, for Pete's sake.  You know how many times a day sharks must say, oh, for Pete's sake.  I got enough already, right?  It's delicious little fish. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  I can't eat it.  This little treat.  Well, the guys will get the audio for you, Ann.  Diane did not have a drinking problem.  That's what they're saying.  Well, I mean, I guess you can't really say if she had a drinking problem.  I mean, it can be said that her blood alcohol level was through the roof, so she definitely  was on some kind of a bender.  Yeah, apparently.  And they found a broken bottle of vodka in the vehicle.  So maybe her body soaked up the alcohol after the accident.  And they found undigested vodka still in her stomach, so she had been drinking as she was 
[00:48:00]  driving.  Now, the kid survived.  One kid.  How old was the kid?  Where was the kid?  A young boy.  Was he like five or something?  Yeah, something like that.  So could he possibly...  Rat his mom out?  Well.  Yeah.  How many people were in her car, and who did she hit?  She hit a family?  Yeah, she hit three guys going down the road.  She destroyed everybody.  Wait, so she killed five people in her car?  She killed eight total, Jimmy. 
[00:48:30]  That's what I'm saying.  Three in the other car?  Yeah, yeah.  And five in hers?  Four in her.  Yeah.  Was it all kids?  Is she...  Yeah, kids.  Kids in hers.  Nieces, a daughter, herself, and then three guys in another car.  And she was...  And her son survived.  And the autopsy results were that she was fucking hammered.  Holy shit.  And now Dominic's here.  Ah, just...  That's already a tragedy. 
[00:49:00]  Go away, Dominic.  Yeah, yeah.  Let the families, you know, heal.  They lost somebody.  That's even more tragic.  Now, he's involved because what?  People are going to go after the husband?  Yes.  I assume that the other family is going to go after everything this woman owned.  You know, and him being married to her, you know, it's all his shit, too.  Right.  So now Dominic comes in to defend, but in defending, it's just...  Ah. 
[00:49:30]  This guy's in for a nightmare because they're going to go after everything.  Three different suits, unless they class action.  I don't know if they can with three people, but they're all going to go after him.  And he's got a son.  Now, he's got a son still.  He's still got his life.  Yeah, yeah.  How many kids did they have?  Was it just the son and the daughter?  The daughter's dead?  Well, yeah, yeah.  Daughter, dead.  So it's the father and the son left.  Yep.  You know what it is, though?  It's like, all right, mount a defense against the fact that, you know, whatever.  I didn't know this woman from a fucking hole in the wall as far as what she's doing. 
[00:50:00]  I didn't say, hey, go drive drunk and do this.  Right.  You know, not saying Diane did not have a drinking problem.  That's a drinking problem.  If you have a carload of kids and you're belting down booze as you're driving and smoking pot, that's kind of a problem.  Yeah.  He's still on TV.  Oh, man.  They're giving him a lot of time today.  So live press conference.  Here he is talking. 
[00:50:30]  See, it's what it is.  Toxicology.  He loves this.  Look, she was not drunk.  And now, look, look, he gets into the camera and makes faces.  What do you think?  I've seen this live.  It's horrendous.  What's he saying?  I want to hear what he said.  Yeah, they're getting it down the hall.  Yeah, I've got to hear this.  If she says, I don't know where I am.  I'm having a problem trying to have my thoughts. 
[00:51:00]  This was more than just something with alcohol.  Something happened to this woman, and we're going to find out why.  Greg, we've asked that anyone contact us.  Go to your website.  Look up our number and call us today.  www.stupidfatmotherfuckers.com  Thank you very much.  Go to your website and call us.  My number won't be there.  All right, Tom Reskin.  Thank you.  Dominic Barbarra.  My number won't be there.  He's probably saying that so he's not a lawyer soliciting. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, probably.  How are you a newsman and you call him Dominic Barbarra?  Barbarra.  Maybe he thought he's like that fucking elephant.  Barbarra.  Dominic Barbarra.  But as a news guy, I mean, Dominic Barbarra.  I mean, everyone knows.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, there was something else going on.  Yeah, when you mix a lot of vodka and maybe a couple hits of weed,  yeah, you're going to be confused where you are.  Amazing.  Yeah, come on.  Give me a break.  Husband says she rarely drank. 
[00:52:00]  Well, she sure picked a great time.  Rarely isn't never.  Man, when you rarely drink, you're not going to decide that, you know,  the one time you drink is when you've got a carload of kids.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  Going 60, 70 miles an hour.  Wrong way.  Wrong way is rarely I just made a mistake.  It's usually, if you look at a wrong way on a highway cases,  they're usually drunk.  I mean, that's just the way it is.  Did anybody survive in the guy's car? 
[00:52:30]  Or was it all three of them?  No, no.  Did you see the wreckage?  I didn't know whose car that was.  There were just pieces left.  Yeah.  It was horrific.  It was two, what was it, two brothers and a friend?  Something like that, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Just, oof, oof.  A head-on collision.  You can almost, if you think about it, feel like what the, it's fucking, how terrible.  It's terrifying.  Eek.  All right.  Moving on to other things.  They should really put something in cars that you can't start them enough already with 
[00:53:00]  drunk driving.  If that's, if that's what, even if it didn't, that's not what killed people.  Enough with it.  Oh, then the ACLU gets involved.  I don't know if they would on that one.  Says, well, you know, no.  On that one, they get involved in all that shit.  I mean, what can they say?  How could it be a civil liberty?  They've had people that have, the ACLU has come to their defense when they've been accused  of drunk driving and then they want to install those breathalyzers.  When they were first starting that, the ACLU jumped on board with that one and said, no,  that's not, that's, you know, punishment after the fact, you know, continuing punishment 
[00:53:30]  after they are already serving their sentence or already did what they have to do.  That's what, that was the whole thing against registering for sex offenders and things like  that.  Well, they already served their time.  Like, stop.  There's some things that transcend that whole bullshit.  Yeah.  You're right.  I know I am.  But they, no, not you.  I was looking at TV.  Oh, okay.  Some guy said Anthony's stupid.  No, you're right. 
[00:54:00]  That's great with him.  Jesus.  How do you fucking fight that?  It's amazing.  I mean, these lawyers will fight anything.  We all know that by now.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's ridiculous.  Just, I mean.  Ridiculous.  It's no surprise that Dominic Barber would take on a case like that.  Can I have a sandwich?  Of course.  Thank you, Kenny.  A sandwich already?  Well, I'm timing it so that when we, you know.  Break?  I'll have a nice sandwich and I won't have to eat it on the air. 
[00:54:30]  Sure.  I'm trying to do that.  Because the worst thing is when I look at that delicious.  It's like, you ever see the trick that people make their little doggies do?  Where they put a little doggie treat on the dog's nose and go, stay, stay, stay.  And the dog is looking like, all he wants is the little treat.  And then you go, get it.  And it goes, yeah, look, see?  Yeah, but that's just to entertain us.  But that's how I feel with the sandwich there when we're on the air. 
[00:55:00]  I'm like, all I can think of is deliciousness.  His dogs can probably smell the treat on their nose.  Oh, it's on their nose.  Of course they smell it.  They're dogs.  They have good scent.  Yes.  Fred from Brooklyn has a little more on Dominic Barber.  Moron?  Fred.  Good morning.  That's a lot of moron.  Hello, Fred.  Hello.  Dominic's first press conference regarding the case was that he was doing it pro bono.  Obviously, he's getting paid.  Why does every aspect of the case need a public press conference unless he's doing it for advertising? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, jury pool.  Juries.  Juries.  And he can announce pro bono all he wants.  But the fact is, like Ann said, he likes the publicity.  He likes being on TV.  And that will lead to more business for Dominic Barber.  So, in the end, he is doing it for money.  Exactly.  There's a value in him taking a case even for no money.  A high-profile case.  He's not doing a pro bono case where it would never make the media.  He's not that type of guy.  And it's pronounced pro bono.  He's doing nobody a favor. 
[00:56:00]  Pro bono means you're a very big user.  Thank you.  All right.  Good job.  Excellent call.  Yes.  Yes.  What?  He's a good guy.  He's doing it like pro bono.  I know.  Really?  There's a lot of people that could use the help of a lawyer that he's not even going  to pay attention to.  And he knows that there's going to be no exposure for the case.  People on Long Island will see it and go like, oh, well, if I need a lawyer, I might  as well get Dominic Barber.  I've heard of him.  I've seen him on the news.  It's, oh, he makes the faces and he gestures toward the camera. 
[00:56:30]  But the funny thing is, his camera sense stinks because he was half off camera the whole time.  He's like falling out of frame.  He's half off camera.  His head's shaking.  He's looking off to one side.  Oh, someone should have cross-body blocked him into the water behind him.  He's very unpleasant.  Oh, he is so unpleasant in the eye.  This is why the breathalyzer for the car doesn't really work.  Graham in PA.  Graham.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  How are you? 
[00:57:00]  When I was like nine or so, my stepdad got arrested for drunk driving.  And they put one of those breathalyzer machines in his car.  And he actually was on an episode of Nova on PBS.  Nova.  Jesus.  And that was when they first started putting him in cars or whatnot.  But what he did is he would just take me along with him to his buddy's house.  And he would get drunk.  And he just taught me how to blow into the breathalyzer. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, okay.  Oh, call it a breathalyzer, did he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that trick works like a charm.  Uncle Paul.  I can't drive the car, Timothy.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  So that's actually a way to beat it, I guess.  But again, it still cuts down.  Yeah.  He can get around anything, but.  Yeah.  All right, then.  If you don't have a kid or a friend to blow into the goddamn thing.  Yeah.  That's got to be nice when you hop in a car with somebody and they go, oh, hold on two 
[00:58:00]  seconds.  When you got to blow into something, it's like, can I just get out?  It's a little embarrassing.  If you're on a date and, you know, the girl gets in the car and you're just like, ah, hold  on.  All right, this is a problem.  He's going to get drunk and punch me at some point.  You think that would be a problem?  Oh, hell yeah.  Especially if you ask her to do it.  Look, you got to blow into this.  Could you blow into this?  Ah, it's just temporary.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  It was a little misunderstanding.  It was really a misunderstanding.  I was fine.  If you don't blow into it, I'm going to sock your head through this fucking window. 
[00:58:30]  Exactly.  I'll fucking elbow the bridge of your nose, bitch.  Driving in general is just ridiculous in the year 2009.  Like, it's so primitive.  I mean, why are we still driving really fast toward other cars coming the other way?  Why are we responsible?  I don't understand that.  Yeah, there's no track.  Like, how about this?  When they make new roads, they go, you know what?  Enough with being so trusting.  Yeah.  That is insane if you think about it. 
[00:59:00]  And the only reason that was done originally was because people were only going 10 miles  an hour.  So it's like, yeah, nothing really bad is going to happen if you hit the car coming the other  way.  But now we're going 55, 60, 65 miles an hour, just missing the...  I mean, we're literally just missing the car that's coming right at you.  And you're driving with complete confidence that the person coming toward you is paying  attention, is not suicidal, is fucking...  And there you are, just closing velocity of fucking 120 miles an hour. 
[00:59:30]  And yeah, you're just, I'm all right with this.  As we talk about this, people are looking at cars flying right past them.  It's amazing if they don't bang together more often.  And yeah, you have to be so trusting.  Like, you know you're doing, you're going to keep it between the lines.  I'll keep it right there.  You know.  But you have to assume all, I mean, not just one, hundreds of cars.  Yeah, yeah.  Every single one is not going to veer off into your lane.  Every single one increases the odds. 
[01:00:00]  Every time you pass a car, the odds are increasing that one will hit you.  One will make a mistake somehow.  It doesn't hit you.  And with more people texting and checking their email as they drive, which is happening,  it's an epidemic.  We all know that.  Yeah.  I mean, they got to, like, change the way we drive.  Yeah.  Well, I think they are looking for some type of automation with cars.  There is a car out right now that does stop if you start, if you're going into the back 
[01:00:30]  of another car and you don't notice, the car itself will step on the brakes for you.  And there's ones with side sensors so that it will alert you if you're drifting out of  your lane or too close to another car on the side of you.  So they're kind of putting these sensors in, but you're still, you know, in control of  the vehicle.  That was an option in my, if I wanted, when I was looking at the, I don't know if it  was on the truck I have now or the Audis I was looking at.  It was an option, really?  Oh, yeah.  If you wanted it.  It sensed another lane.  It also sensed transvestites, I believe, on the sides of roads. 
[01:01:00]  That was the GPS system they gave you.  And it would pull over and the window automatically came down.  It came down.  And the transsexuals, you silly goose.  Oh.  What happens is it actually slows you down, pulls you over, and the window goes, but it  only goes down a few inches.  So they can't put their big thieving masculine hands in.  Steal your shit.  That's a great option.  It certainly is.  Helps.  Comes in handy, apparently.  My solution is this.  People think this is weird, but for cars, they should have a couple of lanes just dedicated 
[01:01:30]  to skipping.  I think that people should skip wherever we're going.  Boo!  See how you'd avoid that?  This is going great.  Does anybody remember laughter?  No, no, no.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Here's what you do.  You build little hills everywhere, so we're always skipping downhill, which gets us moving  quicker.  Yeah.  And you carry your groceries and you skip.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah, let's see how many head-on collisions you have skipping.  You'd see a guy from down the road.  You're not going to hit a man carrying a bag of oranges if you see him skipping towards 
[01:02:00]  you.  Skipping?  Of course not.  Exactly.  Might hit him with your fist, but.  You know, we pointed out something that people didn't want pointed out.  That we're gay?  Well, this guy, Dennis from Jersey.  Well, thanks.  So now I'm really enjoying my drive to work.  Yeah.  Each one.  Enjoy the people's zipping by your left right now.  That car that just passed you, there you go.  The odds are up now that the next one just might hit you.  Yep.  Odds are up a little higher.  Might be the woman putting on the makeup as she goes to work.  Cell phone texting. 
[01:02:30]  It's fucking socking.  Eating, drinking.  It just amazes me that we can't just separate the lanes.  Just a little bit would be a lot safer.  With cotton balls.  Put a big bunch of big bags of cotton balls in between the lanes.  Well, Jersey has a lot of divided highways.  That's why you got to do the old jug handle.  Sure.  Left turn.  You can't just make the fucking left.  Right.  I'd like to know if that does cut down on the accidents there.  It has to.  You think it does?  On the head on, sure. 
[01:03:00]  But then they got the fucking, you know, the parkway and the expressway over there, which  a lot of people seem to crash on.  Dude, even the expressway has just a tiny little wall in between the oncoming lane and  your lanes.  Used to be like nothing there.  Really?  Just a grass medium with a little metal guardrail.  He would go into those.  I like watching those shows where you see them testing the old cars with the old guardrails  and then they realized it just would pretty much cut the car and you in half. 
[01:03:30]  That metal razor blade guardrail.  It's like, let's make a guardrail out of a fucking can opener so it can cut right through  the car and then cut you.  Yeah.  I got a text from Levy.  Did you think that was Brad Pitt on TV?  I got a text from Levy.  Just hope that guy coming at you right now isn't going to have a heart attack.  Oh, Volvo has those sensors? 
[01:04:00]  I didn't know the sensors were actually making their way out there.  Yeah, they are.  That's good to know.  It's an option where you can sense cars in the next lane because I was in a car, I think,  that had them.  It was one of the guys that picked me up for an airport or something.  It's not just Volvo.  It's other cars.  Do you think car accidents keep the economy going, though?  No.  Because the medical costs are so high.  All that stuff, though.  I mean, I'm just wondering, do they figure that stuff in when they're trying to keep  you safer?  Like how much money they would lose if that horrific car accident thing went away? 
[01:04:30]  No, I think because a lawsuit...  Because they don't care about us as human beings.  That's interesting.  Only on, whatchamacallit, only on recalls.  Adaptive cruise control with distance alert.  ACC.  It's designed for smooth traffic flow and can be activated at speeds over 18 miles per  hour.  You just select the desired speed and the minimum time gap to the vehicle in front of you.  When the radar sensor detects a slower vehicle in front of you, the speed automatically adapts  to that vehicle. 
[01:05:00]  If ACC is disengaged and a vehicle in front fails to close, distance alert activates a  red warning light in the lower section of the windshield to help you keep a proper  distance.  So it's almost like, you know, you know, when you're slowly coming up on some asshole  when you got cruise control on and you're like, I'm going to have to step on the fucking  brake and disengage cruise control and then resume and shit.  This will kind of match his speed.  So you won't have to take that off.  Go back there, Dan, because I want to see what this collision warning auto break is. 
[01:05:30]  Adaptive cruise design for smooth traffic flow.  Same thing.  Gap when the radar sensor.  Collision warning with auto break is designed to sense an impending collision and alert  the driver to help avoid or reduce the severity of a crash.  A radar sensor behind the grill continuously monitors the distance of the vehicle driving  in front of you.  If the vehicle suddenly breaks and the system senses that a collision is likely to happen,  it will alert the driver to act with a flash red warning light in the windshield and 
[01:06:00]  an audible alarm.  Moreover, the system support driver indicated braking by obtaining swift brake response  by pre-charging the brakes and preparing for panic brake application.  So it doesn't actually apply the brakes?  Is that what I'm getting?  I guess if the sensor or the warning is going off and you hit the brake, it'll...  It, like, pre-charges the brake, so it's not like you have to... 
[01:06:30]  It's almost like it's pumped already.  Like, you don't have to step on it and have the pedal go down that far.  Well, go back to the cruise control thing.  So it'll slow down your car automatically.  Yeah.  This is what I need to know.  So let's say you're in the right lane, but you're going at a nice clip, and then you  finally hit the car in front of you.  You're like, what the fuck?  My cruise control's all fucked up.  Right.  So this thing that you were just talking about slows down your car.  Now, can you now go, obviously, go into the left lane, because you're going to go around 
[01:07:00]  this person.  Now, that will disengage what just happened and get you back up to speed?  Will it resume to the original speed?  That's what I mean.  Right, right, right, right.  I don't know.  Because that would be a great feature.  That's handy.  So now you're not resetting anymore.  Now all you're doing is like, all right, I've got to get away from this person.  Now there's open highway in front of you, because you're not in that lane anymore.  Does it pop you back to where you were?  I would set it...  Because that would be amazing.  I'd set it for three inches from the guy's bumper.  I know you would.  Just set it there and just... 
[01:07:30]  Now you're following people's a breeze.  I bet you that's not an option, though.  I bet it's not.  Because...  Three inches.  Because then, you know, if there is some kind of incident, you're going to go, well,  I did exactly what this thing was supposed to do.  I actually am designing, and I know people don't think I design auto stuff.  Oh.  But it's an automatic brake airbag system.  Oh, really?  If anything larger than a fruit fly goes in your path, the brakes are slammed on and your  airbag deploys.  It's a safety feature.  Annoying everyone.  That is crazy.  You would just see... 
[01:08:00]  All over the place.  A little pebble comes up from a truck.  You can't even get out of the driveway.  That's the same way with that technology, Jimmy.  Or you can set it where if you feel that's too sensitive, there's a way, there's like  a little bar you put over where the only thing that will stop you is something larger  than a 737 headed directly towards you.  A little dangerous, but...  Yeah.  Okay.  Wow.  Phones.  Trucks have radar that alert you if there is a car in the lane.  Yeah.  Well, trucks need that.  Because they're in big, big, big trucks.  Hey, Bobby.  Can't see them.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[01:08:30]  What are you hauling today, first of all?  Hey, Bob.  Soap.  Soap?  Soap.  All right.  All right.  We hope you don't get robbed to get cleaned out.  Tyler Durden.  Yeah, no one needs soap anymore.  What?  Not at all.  No, it's just everywhere.  Some people keep cleaning.  Oh, wow.  You don't have to truck it around.  It's just everywhere.  Oh, it's in all the stores.  Yeah.  You don't need to haul soap anymore there, sir.  Exactly.  Yeah, take it back.  Take it back.  Okay.  What do you got on this radar thing?  Well, trucks have a few things on them.  They have a lane departure system.  It's like a camera in a windshield that if you veer out of your lane, an audible alarm 
[01:09:00]  will go off and let you know if you're too far to the left or right, like if you're  tired, falling asleep.  Oh.  It'll make like a rubble strip noise through the speakers of the truck.  Wow.  Also, they have a cruise control that will actually slow the truck down, apply the engine  brakes if you get too close to another car.  Damn.  Do they have a jackknife control thing?  No, but...  You're jackknifing, it just jettisons your fucking cargo so you're okay and everybody else  dies? 
[01:09:30]  That would be nice.  You would like that.  I had to jettison the pod.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Also, if we have a turn signal on and there's a car beside us, our radar picks that up and  lets us know that they're in our blind spot.  That's some asshole that's just sitting there in your blind spot.  How much does that annoy you when some idiot is just sitting in your blind spot?  That's stupid.  Not moving.  What's worse is when they're right on the back of my trailer and they sit there and  they won't move.  I can't go left to pass anybody.  They just ride there.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They're just kind of sitting right there. 
[01:10:00]  They usually use a radar blocker.  Some people, yeah, they're blocking radar.  Well, they're usually keeping pace with you.  Yeah.  So if a cop with your radar, because you guys a lot of times really go, you exceed the  limit.  They're busy.  They got to get places.  They sure do.  I can't stand a fucking fag that will not pass a truck because they're afraid to fucking  pass it.  So they sit right there off of the rear left of your vehicle in the left lane.  You guys are in the middle lane.  And fuck up traffic. 
[01:10:30]  Exactly.  Because they're afraid to fucking pass the big bad truck.  Exactly.  All right, Bob.  Douchebags.  Douchebags.  Thank you.  All right, boys.  Is Joe Rogan down the hall?  If he is, we should take a break.  Thumbs up.  Because Ant's got food.  I got myself.  Look, it's on my nose.  Watch.  I see that.  That's right.  It's a Michelob.  You want to take any others?  This is a good question from Trucker Mike.  Is Anthony going to get the sidewalk speed sensor for when he drives on the sidewalk? 
[01:11:00]  Yes.  Actually, I'm researching that technology.  And what?  I know we have to take a break, but I think I don't I need to know what this one's about.  I pulled my rear view mirror, my side view mirrors in so fast one day because they electronically come in to miss.  I was on the sidewalk to miss a fence post and a traffic light post.  Jesus.  And they sucked in and it was perfect.  It went and I squeezed through and then back out again.  Hey, I'm fucking good.  Just another normal day of driving for you. 
[01:11:30]  Sidewalk.  There's no traffic on the sidewalk.  Dave in New Orleans.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Dave.  Thanks for checking in.  Hey, what's up?  Good evening.  Good day, Dave.  Come on, Dave.  Hey, look, guys.  These fucking guys put up a cable system on a stretch of interstate here in Louisiana.  It's the deadliest stretch of interstate.  It's a three cable system that's tied down by just vertical metal lines all the way down like fucking 80 miles of this shit. 
[01:12:00]  I've seen those things.  I don't understand.  I've seen people hit them on TV.  And they kind of keep you – they don't bang you back into traffic.  They just kind of slow you down.  I don't understand.  They're metal cables that are on these little metal stanchions.  Yeah.  But the stanchions aren't like these big things that are going to destroy your car.  So if you veer into them, it absorbs the shock and you almost ride along it until you stop.  It's not like a guardrail or a cement wall where you're going to hit it and then bounce back out into traffic. 
[01:12:30]  It's almost like an arresting system.  Do they work?  Yeah.  Unless you're on a motorcycle.  Well, motorcycles are a little rough.  You're probably going to – your leg is going to come off.  You're going to live the rest of your life with three stripes on your left side.  You're just getting rope burned on a motorcycle.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, so that's like the new guardrail, I guess, then?  I saw a whole show on guardrails and things on Discovery.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And that and the water barriers. 
[01:13:00]  Were you paralyzed at the time?  I couldn't find my remote.  What were you doing at the time?  Were you having your dick and feet sucked at the same time?  How do you not get up and turn off a show on guardrails?  It was fascinating.  You don't even have to get up.  You got the remote.  Because they showed like the whole history of guardrails and before they had them and then they show like now the technology that's kind of amazing.  It's more of an arresting system and they have water barriers.  Those big orange – you ever see those big orange barrels?  No, I've never seen them. 
[01:13:30]  On the off ramps?  No, no.  See, when you're looking at the highway and then the off ramp on that little triangular piece of real estate is big orange buckets.  And they are normally filled with water, which slows the vehicle down as they hit it.  Or sand sometimes.  They fill it up with sand.  It's got to be a big problem if you hit one of those.  Of course it is.  Well, I think you're –  I think that would be a major problem.  Look at this.  Yeah, you get a car wash.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you get a car wash.  You ever see the videos of people hitting those fucking things?  Amazing.  Water everywhere. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, your car's shiny.  It's nice.  All right, thank you.  You know what?  I would love to see that special.  Before the regard rails, a bunch of stock footage of like fucking jalopies going off cliffs.  It actually was.  They showed jalopies in head-on collisions.  And those – nothing happened to a jalopy when they hit each other.  They – like the people would be pulverized inside because there was no energy.  Like the vehicles now have the crumble zones and they really do absorb a lot of the energy of a crash.  So the energy doesn't go into your body. 
[01:14:30]  Right.  The old cars could roll over and you'd see like, wow, nothing happened to the car.  But the guy inside is just smashed.  He's got a steering column through his chest, fucking brake pedal in his head.  But nowadays, you know, the cars are meant to kind of bend up in the right spots.  I like that new technology with the guard rail and the cable system.  It is.  All right, good.  We are moving forward.  Yeah, we're trying.  I mean, that rumble strip, how great is that?  Bleh!  How great is that, though?  I know.  Oh.  It's a pain in the ass when you're texting, though.  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  It distracts me.  I'd like to suck your puss.  What's a puss, Gerger?  Gleedle, leedle.  Does anyone else ride the rumble strip because it feels good in the groin?  Oh, it does.  It makes you tingle a little bit.  Oh, yeah, boy, does it.  It's a little tingly down there.  A little tingly.  I do that while my girl.  You can get off within two miles if you continue.  I only do that with the windows open in the winter so my girlfriend's teeth will chatter while she sucks my balls.  I work the shaft.  I hit the fucking little guardrail strip and her fucking teeth chatter. 
[01:15:30]  If she gets a little tired and her jaw hurts, you hit the rumble strip and let that do the work.  Yeah, exactly.  Just keep it in her mouth.  Yeah, it's called a lazy blowjob.  I got to point out the obvious.  We're a bunch of shock jocks that used to have hardcore lesbian action, and now we just spent 20 minutes talking about guardrails.  Guardrails.  Well, you know something?  People pass them every ding-dong day.  Attaboy, Amp.  Your favorite radio show is growing up.  See, but it went right to blowjobs and rumble strips.  Of course, that's true.  Shattering teeth and a fucking pair of balls.  Yes.  No one believes that nonsense. 
[01:16:00]  Yay.  All right, Ant's going to eat a sandwich.  Joe Rogan's going to walk down the very long hallway to talk about UFC the first time in Philly.  That's huge.  I have to answer a question, too, by the way.  What?  Everybody has been asking me.  Oh.  Oh, Jimmy.  Going, when are you going to come down and do it?  Oh, but it's Jimmy's plug.  Do one in Wildwood, New Jersey, but I don't know.  It's a beach, and I'm not really big on the beach.  So I said, I'm going to go to Casbah Comedy Club in Wildwood, New Jersey. 
[01:16:30]  First time there in years.  August 21, 22.  609-522-8444.  Only two nights.  I like that Wildwood.  You take me to the Casbah.  I haven't been there.  I used to do that gig.  Is it on the boardwalk?  It's a block up.  I think it's on Atlantic Avenue.  Yeah.  Okay.  And we're going to be on vacation the week before.  That's why I'm plugging it now.  Do it again there, Jimmy.  August 21, 22.  I have not been in Wildwood in probably eight years.  Sounds good.  That's going to be all right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Mark Vito's a buddy of mine. 
[01:17:00]  He owns a club, and I wanted to do it.  All right.  I don't know why I'm explaining my reasons.  No one gives a fuck.  Not even me, and I'm doing it.  Who cares?  Rogan's waiting.  Let's take a break.  I'm going to piss if we'll get Joe in.  Yeah, Rogan's in.  And quickly, Jim Jeffries at 830, Dana White at 9 o'clock on the phone, and then Devin  to talk about John Hughes a little bit.  An old friend of ours.  We haven't seen him in a while.  Yeah, in quite a while.  Quite a while.  It's Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and now Joe Rogan. 
[01:17:30]  Joe's up.  Yes.  One of my favorite comics.  I say it every time he's on.  It's the truth.  This is my favorite radio show.  Well, probably not.  Best fucking radio show in the history of the world.  No arguments.  Joe's playing the Helium Comedy Club tonight.  The tickets have to be gone.  Probably.  They have to be.  Well, one of the shows is already sold out.  I think the second one's sold out.  Maybe there's some tickets for the first.  Only tonight.  8 o'clock and 1030.  You can go to heliumcomedy.com, or just call him 215-496-9001. 
[01:18:00]  And it's only tonight because he's doing the UFC.  That's an awesome club.  You do that place, right?  Never did helium.  Never did it?  No.  It's a nice club.  And I back up.  But I say, I'll be at the Helium Comedy Club tonight to see Joe.  You can see Opie if you go.  Oh, whoa.  Yes.  Watch out.  I'll take pictures with you.  He'll make the MySpace kissy face.  And Joe Rogan, of course, from UFC.  And we're going down for the first UFC fight ever for us.  It's going to be sick.  Oh, you've never been?  Oh, my God.  Dana White invites us all the time.  Jimmy has taken him up on it.  And I always had something going on, but finally I don't. 
[01:18:30]  And I'm going to watch my first UFC fight.  Nice.  I can't wait.  It's a good one, too.  Philly's going to be perfect, too.  Because Philly is like, you know, as far as sports, it's a fucking rabid town.  It's a perfect place for you.  Oh, my God.  They're animals.  They're just maniacs.  Yeah.  Any boring part of the fight, you're going to hear, boo, get up, you faggots.  It's going to be awesome.  Philly asshole jump in himself.  Probably.  Probably.  Oh, there's going to be shirts off for sure.  Yeah.  Shirts off for the audience when someone wins.  Fuck yeah.  Who's fighting?  B.J. Penn is fighting?  B.J. Penn is fighting Kenny Florian for the lightweight title. 
[01:19:00]  And Forrest Griffin is fighting Anderson Silva at 205.  That's going to be pretty sick.  That's a sick fight.  We had Forrest in there.  Forrest is out of his mind.  He's an animal.  He's crazy.  Hilarious, too.  He is very funny.  Great personality on him.  There's a couple guys that could be doing stand-up.  Like Forrest and Rampage.  Both those guys are funny enough that if they wanted to, they could do stand-up.  I'd like to see him handle hecklers.  Yeah, exactly.  Up there and fucking choke him out.  That's the problem.  You get angry.  It's funny.  We had Forrest in here for an hour.  And then I saw him briefly somewhere else.  I was asking him to sign something for my nephew. 
[01:19:30]  And he wouldn't have recognized me if I sat down and put on headphones.  I'd remember me.  I was so unmemorable from the last one.  We should walk around with headphones.  We can write a lot more.  You know what's great about Forrest is when he's sitting there talking, he doesn't talk  about UFC like it's an art.  He's not like...  He goes, other guys are into the whole fighting and this and technique.  The martial art aspect of it.  And that and stuff.  He goes, I just like fucking hitting people and beating people up. 
[01:20:00]  And he says that.  But quite honestly, he's very technical.  He's one of those self-deprecating guys.  You know, if you watch the way he fights, I mean, he's got a very underrated technique.  You know what I mean?  He beats Shogun.  But you can tell he does like beating up people.  Oh, yeah, he likes it.  Yeah, don't get me wrong.  It's a combo.  It's a hybrid.  He enjoys it.  He's a hybrid thug slash martial artist.  And he came in here just all fucked up.  And the bridge of his nose was split.  Oh, yeah, always.  He has one testicle, has no problem talking about it.  He told us, yeah.  That might not be true. 
[01:20:30]  He does have a broken arm, though, that was broken and he never had it set.  So it's got like a hump to it.  Oh, yeah, we saw that.  It's pretty nasty.  He wouldn't tap out.  He got his arm broken in a fight and kept fighting.  He's a tough dude.  Knocked the guy out with his other arm.  His arm was broken.  That's sick.  Yeah, he told us.  And he came in to promote his book.  And Joe goes, did you read his book?  I'm like, I didn't.  He goes, you got it.  It's really funny.  It's hilarious.  Hilarious book.  It's called Got Fight.  Yeah.  Get it on Amazon or whatever the fuck you do.  It's very good.  It's fucking good.  100 was great.  Fucking 100 was amazing. 
[01:21:00]  The Brock Lesnar fellow.  How about that, huh?  How about that?  A little, a little, a little, makes you nervous, doesn't it?  Gave him a schoolyard beating.  That's a schoolyard beating.  Because Mier's arm was backing out.  It was almost like, that's how somebody would beat me up.  Yeah.  He molested him.  He really did give him a savage beating.  Were you nervous?  Fantastic to watch.  Were you nervous talking to him after the fight?  Yes.  It seemed like you were.  And Joe's not a nervous guy.  No.  Joe's not intimidating very easily.  Yeah, but when I'm around him, I want to groom him.  I want to be like the little monkey picking bugs off him.  I saw the post-fight interview, and I'm like, I think Joe might be nervous for the first time ever. 
[01:21:30]  Well, first of all, he just got done smashing a dude for the UFC heavyweight championship.  He's a little fired up.  You know, you just worry that he might do something random.  And he did.  Yeah, he did.  But when he got in front of the cage, did you see when he was screaming and yelling at the camera?  His mouth was frothing.  That's real shit.  But that's not an act.  That's like caveman stuff.  Like everything in his mind that we have evolved to from caveman to now went away.  And he just turned into screaming. 
[01:22:00]  You see saliva and tears and snot.  He's supposed to be doing that.  If you look at the way he's built, you look at his fucking head, you look at the size of those lunch boxes he calls fists, that he's supposed to be doing that.  If that guy lived 5,000 years ago, he'd be on the biggest fucking horse with the biggest sword at the front of the line, just chopping off heads.  He's smashing people with a fucking mace.  I'm getting crazy.  I'm knocking over water.  Knocking over water bottles.  Sorry, Jimmy.  He's a fucking gladiator.  His whole body's covered with, like, skull tattoos and dragon tattoos. 
[01:22:30]  He's a fucking monster.  And he still has a lot of room for a lot more tattoos.  Or smashing people's heads in, too.  It also shows you how powerful Dana White is because he turned him around.  I would love to know what he said to him behind closed doors.  Lesnar's actually a very nice guy.  Don't get me wrong.  I mean, when I say he's a fucking savage, he's a gentleman.  When you speak to him, he's a very nice guy.  He's very soft-spoken.  He's very humble.  But when it comes down to fighting, when it comes down to competing and performing, he gets fucking crazy, you know?  I went to the press conference after the fight, and I didn't like the way he got in Muir's face. 
[01:23:00]  I was like, come on, man.  Just beat the shit out of the guy.  I said, what are you doing?  He said, don't do that.  Or whatever.  And I was talking to one of the press guys, the publicity guys for UFC.  I'm like, I can't fucking believe that he went up and trashed Bud Light.  And he goes, oh, that's been handled.  That's been dealt with.  Which, what he was saying was that Dana had gone back, and he came.  I actually liked Brock.  When he came in and sat down and apologized and was kind of like, eh, you know, I got carried.  I actually, that's when I really started to like him.  He was holding a Bud Light, too, right?  Yeah.  I didn't like him before that.  I just hope Dana doesn't tame him too much. 
[01:23:30]  No, no, no, no.  I kind of like that raw energy a little bit.  I don't think you can.  It's like when you have a pit bull, you only have him in control so much.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, you could sit, sit.  But when you leave the room, that motherfucker's going to do whatever he wants.  Rip your couch apart if he wants.  That's what's going on.  This doesn't matter.  Scary, spooky dude.  He's a spooky dude.  There's nobody in UFC that could probably come close to a room.  Physically, he's so fucking strong.  He's the only guy that's a real heavyweight because the weight class goes up to 265. 
[01:24:00]  He's the only guy that's cutting weight and not fat.  He's cutting water weight to get down to 265.  What was amazing and what I think demonstrated the size and strength of this motherfucker was when he was on top of, what's his name?  Frank Mir.  Yeah, Mir.  A lot of times when someone's on top and they're trying to punch the face, the guy on the bottom has a good technique of covering up and not really getting hit.  He was punching through his defenses and just hitting this motherfucker so hard in the face. 
[01:24:30]  Well, Mir made a crucial mistake.  He let Brock get wrist control.  He got a little relaxed.  Mir's a really good jiu-jitsu guy.  And a lot of times jiu-jitsu guys, they'll, like, relax on the bottom.  Like, just, okay, you're on top.  I'm just going to conserve some energy.  But you can't do that with that fucking gorilla.  Oh, my God.  He just hits too hard.  And he's too, he's a really good wrestler.  I mean, he was NCAA national champion.  So he's, like, he's a real, legit amateur wrestler.  He's very good at pressing down, holding dudes down, using his hips, keeping Mir from getting anywhere and stuffed him up against the cage.  He was putting his hand.  He was putting his hand. 
[01:25:00]  I was, like, I was, like, what a smart move.  Because he was, like, covering his mouth, which I know they do, so you can't breathe.  Fucking animals.  And he's got his fucking big fucking, like, Bosworth crew cut.  And he's rubbing it on Mir's face.  And you know he's, that's really unpleasant.  It's got to hurt.  That's a fucking massive head.  Well, the worst part was the way he had his head.  If you saw the position.  Oh, God, yeah.  He was in the half guard, which is, like, a defensive position from the bottom.  But what Lesnar does is he gets you in, like, this weird neck crank.  Where he takes the right arm completely out of the equation. 
[01:25:30]  And then he's got your fucking head bent forward.  And then he's controlling, with his armpit, he's controlling his left.  So, really, all Frank Mir could do was, like, put his hand in front of his face.  That's all he had was this.  This is as much motion as he had.  Just his hand from his forearm down, from his elbow down.  So then his fucking cinder block is smashing through that hand into his face.  He's a spooky fucking dude.  That was terrible, dude.  That was a rape.  Quite a beating, yeah.  And did you see, we went back with Reed afterwards. 
[01:26:00]  And we walked by.  You know, we don't, what do you say to the fighters?  We walked, Frank Mir walked by.  And it's really weird to see a beaten fighter like that.  You really want to say something to make him feel better.  Because he seemed like a nice enough guy.  Punch me.  And I didn't say anything.  I think he walked by.  And as he was walking, I just went, hey, Frank.  And Bob goes, hey, Frank, good job, man.  Oh, Bobby.  Bob Kelly said.  Oh, Bobby.  But it wasn't to be a dick.  He just didn't.  No, it just can't.  It's like it's a comedian.  What can you say?  Yeah, after a bad set, someone will go, good job.  That's the worst, when you have a terrible set and someone says, hey, great set. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, it wasn't.  No, no.  Don't even say it.  I know it wasn't.  Don't look at me.  You know it wasn't.  Yeah, yeah.  Good job, Frank.  No eye contact.  Just keep walking.  But it's a thousand times worse getting your ass kicked than just having a bad set.  Jake doesn't think Brock Lesnar could fight.  Jake, you got Joe Rogan.  What do you got?  Good evening, boy.  Hi, Jake.  Welcome aboard.  Hey, listen, you know, I understand that, Joe, you know, you got to defend the guy.  But, you know, I really think that they really need to start testing for steroids, you know, 
[01:27:00]  months and months out.  Because that dude is so roided up and just so large, nobody can handle him.  Well, maybe.  Maybe.  I mean, I'm not saying he's definitely never used anything.  I don't know.  But he's never failed a steroid test, ever.  In his NFL career, when he's trying to play for the NFL, he's never, in the UFC, the fights  that he's had in MMA when he fought for K-1 in Los Angeles.  He's never tested positive.  It doesn't mean he's not using it, you know, but I think he's a genetic freak.  Because no matter what you do, you can't get a fucking head like that from steroids. 
[01:27:30]  That head is gigantic.  That's two normal heads.  If you saw, if, like, scientists from a thousand years from now found his fossil right next to, like,  David Spade's fossil, they'd be like, okay, we have two totally separate species.  This is a different species.  The planet was inhabited by two separate species.  Yeah, you can't do that with roids.  No matter what, there's a part of him that's just genetically off the charts.  That's Viking blood.  That's some shit from thousands of years ago.  He's like 6'2 or 6'3.  And he's 265 when he cuts. 
[01:28:00]  You know, that means he dehydrates itself to make 265.  And then he gets back up to, like, 285, 290.  He's the only guy that's doing that in that weight class.  That's the difference.  See, if you look at a guy like, say, Matt Hughes.  Matt Hughes is a big 170, and he really weighs, like, 185, 190, and then he drops weight to get to 170 and then reinflates with water.  But most of the guys at heavyweight, they were, like, Randy, when he's at his heaviest, weighs, like, 225 for Randy Couture.  And Frank Mir's, like, 245.  Well, Lesnar's 290.  That's a giant difference. 
[01:28:30]  That is, yeah.  And it's flesh and bone.  It's not fat.  It's fucking meat.  It's meat and solid, extra-thick bone.  Fuck.  How do you beat a guy like, like, uh, everybody is, like, talking about Fedor going to Strikeforce, which does suck.  But a guy like, like, how good of a fighter?  Terrible.  That would have been such a great matchup.  That's, I know.  So disappointing.  Yeah, it's, uh, how, but is a guy like that the only guy with a shot of beating a guy like Lesnar?  Because a guy like that has wrestled guys of his strength before?  Well, no, he has not. 
[01:29:00]  He's not wrestled anybody as strong as Brock Lesnar.  But, you know, the other questions come to mind are the cage.  The cage is totally different than the way Fedor has fought in rings.  Because when you get trapped in the bottom of the cage and you're pinned up against the cage, that's a real bad spot.  You can get fucked up.  Plus, he's never, also, he's never fought with elbows.  So elbows and the cage together are a very lethal combination.  Because you can't move your head.  When you're stuck in the ring, your head goes underneath the bottom rope and you can move around.  You've got some freedom when the guy's punching you.  They'll reset you to the center.  It's less dangerous for the guy on the bottom. 
[01:29:30]  Right.  When you're in a cage and you're stuffed up against it, very dangerous.  I've seen, you know, yeah, just having your face shoved against chain link and having it being, like, like it's on a cheese grater sometimes.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's why those powerful wrestlers have a much better, the UFC look is much better for a guy like Mark Coleman, say, when he was the UFC heavyweight champion.  Because he's a specialist in smashing your face in against the cage.  That's what he does best.  They hold you against the cage and they punch you like Lesnar did.  Yeah, yeah.  Punch your fucking face in. 
[01:30:00]  It's very tough to do that in the ropes with the ring.  Mike in Minneapolis, just to add to the steroid thing, Lesnar has taken over 53 different steroid tests since college and never failed.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know what guys have taken and what guys can't.  So I can't say one way or another honestly.  But honestly, you can't build a frame like that.  I hope we have that quote and someday it comes out that you were the one in the locker room sticking the needle in his ass and shit.  Yeah, it was fucking Joe Rogan.  I went to Mexico and everybody.  I went to Tijuana with him. 
[01:30:30]  I had a fucking Cheech mustache on him, buying a shit for him.  Yes.  My friend, you got D-ball, my friend?  Fucking Rogan shot up everybody, man.  It was fucking...  That was my job.  I really do commentary only a couple times a week.  Most of the job is acquiring steroids from all over the board.  I go to Brazil.  Joe, you do such a good job, man.  Oh, thank you.  I've listened to what you call that fight.  It was like you called...  And the amazing thing about Rogan is you called...  My favorite fight of the night was fucking...  Oh, my God.  I know exactly what you're going to say.  And...  Not Cooper. 
[01:31:00]  Fucking Bisbane and who?  Henderson.  And Henderson, yeah.  That fucking...  You called it right before he stepped into that fucking right, man.  You rescued that motherfucker because you said, look at what he's doing.  He's keeping his arm and...  He was circling towards Henderson's right hand and he was dropping his left hand.  He just got flustered.  You know what happened?  He talked a ton of shit before that fight and Henderson is a fucking savage.  That guy's a savage.  He looks like him.  And he knew...  And Henderson never got upset and kept his cool, but he knew that when they got in there  that he was going to have to deal with that guy. 
[01:31:30]  And then once he started dealing with him, he realized...  He was in there with a different kind of guy.  He was getting fucked up in that first round.  You said he's circling around to the wrong side.  He's circling right into him.  And right after you said that, wham!  Well, his coach was calling it too.  His coach was saying, you know, you're moving into his fucking right hand.  Get the fuck away from his right hand!  It was just crazy.  It was the total wrong thing you could ever...  But I think he's just so fucked up.  I think the first round, he got hit hard a bunch of times.  He was out of it.  I think he was just out of it.  Just making mistakes.  You know, Jimmy makes a good point, though. 
[01:32:00]  I hope Dane is taking care of you because you're perfect for the UFC.  Oh, well, thank you.  I'm honored to get the job.  And to me, it's like a dream gig.  It's like I'm a professional fan.  And they take care of me very well.  You get to hang out with them all and shit.  That comes across, though, too.  It's not like you're one of these stuffy announcer guys.  Like, you're very fucking knowledgeable on the sport.  But you have, like, this very relatable, regular guy attitude towards it.  So I think that really...  Oh, thanks, man.  People like watching that, you know?  I really am just a professional fan. 
[01:32:30]  I mean, I've never...  I don't know how you're supposed to do it.  You know what I mean?  I just do it.  No one's ever told me how to do it before.  You just go and do it.  You just point out what's happening.  And what about Tito Ortiz?  He's back.  He's back.  It's hilarious, isn't it?  You can't talk so much shit about him.  What the fuck, exactly?  Him and his woman.  I mean, it's really crazy.  It's so bizarre.  It's very bizarre.  There's a video on YouTube.  It's a good move for him.  Of Tito doing an ice bath after his first day of training.  Chop Meat finally beat Tito, by the way.  Oh, really? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, Chop Meat fucking UFC, the game.  My guy's name is Chop Meat.  Oh, nice.  He finally beat Tito.  Yeah, finally.  I heard Chuck is impossible to beat in a game.  Really?  That's what I've heard.  That's everybody complains.  You can't beat Chuck.  I never...  I haven't had to...  I get those emails from Dana that goes,  Hey, instead of training nine weeks for this fight that you picked,  Could you train three weeks and go against some guy?  You know, mystery fighter.  Oh, they send you emails?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's cool.  And it's like, you know, all right, I'll get a little more points for shit like this. 
[01:33:30]  So it's like, all right, I'll take the fight.  And then it's like Forrest Griffith.  And I'm like, ah, I picked like some sap that I knew I could just fucking rattle.  And then I get in there and just get fucked up.  And there's my first loss.  I was 8-0.  And then now I'm fucking, you know, then I'm 8-1.  We're already working on the next one.  It's a great game, man.  Go back in a couple weeks to LA.  I have to work on the next one.  And by the way, part of the game that doesn't get enough notice or mention is the fucking card girls coming out of the ring. 
[01:34:00]  And they have made computer tits jiggle so nicely in that game, Undisputed.  It's incredible.  The first time I saw Undisputed, I saw it for like a second.  I thought it was a real fight.  Yeah, you think it's like real fucking.  For one second.  When they first started playing it for us, I was like, I've never seen this angle.  Like, what video is this?  I went, oh, that's a fucking, that's a video game.  Holy shit.  I have my guy.  All I did was concentrate on his kicking.  And like, I poured it into just kicking all these points. 
[01:34:30]  So now I go in there and just face, side, face, side, back up, face, side.  But if I get in there with somebody that like pinned me down, which has happened.  You got no ground game?  I have none, none ground game.  And I just get my ass handed to me.  Yeah, look how great that fucking looks.  When you see it for a second, it's like.  Yeah.  I mean, after you see a move and there's, it's still something.  It's like, do you see I Am Legend when they had those fake animals?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like the, they just, the, the, the lions.  They were off.  It's off.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's still off.  Were they fake those lions? 
[01:35:00]  I swear to God, I didn't know they were fake.  That's what I heard, Jim.  That's what I heard.  I'm not kidding.  I knew that the, the, the creatures were fake.  What, you think the graph?  I didn't know that they were real.  You think the graphics are a little off on this, Joe?  Yeah, I mean, it's off compared to humans.  It's not, it's very close.  He said you could sense his computer.  I mean, obviously no one's going to show you this and you go, look, these two guys are  really fighting.  You gotta go, no, it's a fucking game.  It doesn't look like Atari basketball.  Right.  The first one that came out.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  I remember Pong, man.  Three pixels.  It looks pretty good.  Oh, it's fucking amazing.  I know you're saying that.  If you showed somebody that back in like 1985. 
[01:35:30]  They would lose their fucking minds.  You'd be like, what is this?  I'm watching a movie or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, when they're playing with characters that are made out of five pixels.  There's a chick jiggle.  Oh, there's a chick.  And it's like I say a lot, like, can you imagine how good these things are going to  be in like six, seven hundred years?  Ah, wow, I can't wait.  Let's only hope we stay alive long enough to see.  Your lips are God's ears, Joe.  God, do I have to shit right now?  Do you?  I can't express to you what's happening inside me.  Do it.  Do it. 
[01:36:00]  Wow.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Shit your pants.  I can't.  Make the little pants change.  There's very few things in life more satisfying than a good shit.  It's one of the most underrated things in the world.  I know, like the type of shit where your legs actually kick out straight.  Like, I've been blowing these gigantic boogers out of my nose because I had a deviated septum  operation and I've been getting these giant scab boogers.  They're fucking, I had it a month ago.  I got pictures of anyone to see.  I put them on my Twitter page.  I saw them.  They're fucking, they're so fucking big, but god damn, they're so satisfying.  When they come out, they feel good, right?  I told you, I had that surgery. 
[01:36:30]  I didn't get those boogers, I guess because I didn't get blocked up or whatever.  Well, my nose has been smashed so many different times.  The inside of it is all fucked.  It's like, you see guys where they get cauliflower ear because their ear gets smashed so many  times and it fills up with blood and hardens.  Well, your nose gets like that too.  As it was, I don't know, I mean, it's how it's been explained to me, but your septum gets  smashed and twisted and it fills with blood and it thickens.  So they had to cut all that shit out.  So the inside of my nose was jacked.  God damn.  You feel better now though, right?  You gotta see the booger pictures.  Look at these boogers.  Look at that.  Oh, fuck! 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, look at that.  That came out a couple days ago.  Nice, right?  Look at the fucking size of that.  Look at the fucking size of that.  It looks like a ring.  It doesn't even look real.  It's got colors and textures.  I had to take pictures of it.  I had to put it on my Twitter page.  It's so hard to believe that.  And that came out a month after the operation.  He had to put it on his Twitter page.  Of course you had to.  I put it on my Twitter page.  For sure.  You know, speaking of your Twitter page.  It's gigantic.  To change gears now.  Is it true?  Is it true when you were out there?  Was it San Francisco?  You were drinking urine?  Yeah, I drank my piss.  Why would you say that? 
[01:37:30]  I've done it a bunch of times.  But now, you know, when I read something like that on your Twitter page, I'm like, why  the fuck wouldn't you say that little thing for us?  Well, I'll do it for you guys.  But wait, you said...  Is it your first piss only?  Fuck, I can't look at that.  It's supposed to be your first piss.  Oh, it's like a bad clam.  Oh, yeah.  That's like a clam that you open up and go, oh, yeah.  It doesn't seem like it was really inside my nose.  But man, when it came out, it felt so good.  It was like I was backed up.  No shit.  When it comes out, too, it's like it breaks free and you hear, like, and when I blew it 
[01:38:00]  and it came out, it was just like, whoa, I can't even believe it.  No, I saved it, though, to my office.  Sitting on an empty Starbucks cup.  This is a bigger sitting there right on my desk.  Wasn't that thing hard?  I haven't even moved it.  You can play marbles with it eventually.  No.  Fuck.  That is what is on the floor of someone's kitchen right when you put the baby furniture  up for sale on eBay.  That's something that Dr. Baden scrapes off the back of a car, you know? 
[01:38:30]  When he's trying to figure out how you got shotgunned in the head, that's what he scrapes  and it's like the scene in Pulp Fiction.  Oh, God damn.  So why the urine drink in there, Joe?  Well, you know, what I was explaining is that a lot of people drink it, supposedly it's  medicine.  And I don't know the science behind it, whether it's right or not, but there's people that  say that it has proteins and antibodies and that your body actually produces it.  Like when you eat vitamins and stuff.  I know when you take mushrooms, they say that when you're hitting your peak, you're supposed  to drink your piss.  Because your piss has like, the psilocybin gets filtered through your urine and it's 
[01:39:00]  in your urine.  So when you're tripping your fucking balls off and then you drink your piss, it just  boom, takes you over the top and you blast right through to the other dimension.  I mean, I've never done it.  I've never drinking my piss while I've been tripping because I always forget.  But that's the science behind it.  It doesn't take so much.  You're going to see some serious shit.  You want to drink it?  Drink your piss.  It's not that bad.  The first one in the morning.  It tastes like warm water.  The first one in the morning is supposed to be the best for you. 
[01:39:30]  Lyoto Machida, the UFC light heavyweight champion, he drinks his urine every morning.  But is that, it's not like eating shit.  Like, it's just, it's.  Yes, you can say that again.  Look, I wouldn't want a hundred dollar price difference, Joe.  A hundred dollars.  Unless you know Dennis Hoffman, he hooks you up.  Hey, can we have Dr. Steve call in?  I would love to ask you about that with Dr. Steve.  Because I heard that Machida did that.  And I was like, is that just an old wives' tale or is it actually good for you?  It is odd to think that.  I don't know if it's right, though.  It's kind of, it's a waste. 
[01:40:00]  It's a waste.  Yeah, it seems like a waste.  It is, but it's also like.  What they say is that your shit is your, I mean, this is the people who do it all the  time.  They say your shit is your waste, but there's proteins and all sorts of like good things  for you that come out of your urine that get filtered through your body that you recycle.  I wouldn't doubt that because like just when you eat asparagus, you're smelling something.  So obviously something from the asparagus is going through.  Sure.  There's nothing bad in asparagus that has to be filtered out.  You're eating the fucking stuff.  Well, but just eat more asparagus instead of going, should I drink my asparagus piss? 
[01:40:30]  Or have a vitamin.  Maybe I'll have some.  Yeah.  Or take a vitamin or something.  Wait, let's, let's slow down a little bit.  You wouldn't drink your own piss?  No.  If Joe did.  Hope is setting something up here.  I see what you're doing.  I see the wheels spinning there, fella.  The great instigator.  They're going to know him.  It's not even.  You know how Reagan was the great communicator?  You're the great instigator.  I'm just keeping an open mind here.  If Joe did it, I, how much do you have to drink though?  You know, as much as you're comfortable with.  You're not shugging it like a Gatorade, are you?  Well, if you have to.  With a little lemon and salt.  You just got to do.  Do what you got to do.  One of those beer pisses. 
[01:41:00]  When you're waiting in line.  When you drink your own piss and it's foamy.  You finally get there.  Those are the ones where I could like break apart two cigarette butts and peel the paper off  the filter.  Cut through the ice.  How much better does that feel than a shitty blowjob too?  Like a shitty blowjob doesn't feel nearly as good as a great piss.  A really good piss.  We get that shiver at the end like, oh.  Yeah.  You know, a girl doesn't really want to blow you and is blowing you and you know she doesn't  want to and she's not enthusiastic. 
[01:41:30]  It's just bad technique.  It's a disaster.  A good piss is way better than that, right?  I'll take a bad blowjob over someone just doing it because they love you.  I would rather have someone like, oh, I really don't want to do this, but I really dig  your act.  It's like, oh, that kind of turns me out.  Someone's got to, they got to be into you.  Otherwise, it's useless.  I never really appreciated how bad some girls can be at it until you get really good ones.  Like when you're a kid in fucking high school, she could just touch the tip of her tongue  to your head and you're like, I'm getting a blowjob! 
[01:42:00]  Boom!  It's great!  And meanwhile, what the fuck?  But you get a girl with fucking just drooling like a camel and twisting your fucking cock with  her hand and just blah, blah, blah, and just stuffing it deep into her esophagus where  you're like, you can't even believe it goes back to you.  You're in bronchial tubes.  There's some girls online that will suck you.  They suck the cock and it's like an eight, nine inch cock.  They suck it all the way and then she's licking the balls while the dick is all the way in  her mouth.  It's like, where is that cock? 
[01:42:30]  I don't even want that.  I think I don't even want to do that.  That chick would ruin you because there's only a tiny amount of girls on the planet that  could do that.  That could do that.  Yeah, that's like a trick.  You know, you tell your chick, just try it, just try it, and she throws up all over you  there, and I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  It's Heather, I think that girl's name is.  Yes, yes.  Heather, idthroat.com.  Oh, look, it's you, too.  And her fucking, her lucky, her lucky fucking husband has some stupid tattoo around his  belly so you always know it's the same guy getting blown by, and she is a fucking trooper.  When you recognize a dude, that's when you know you're a real pervert, when you recognize  a guy's dick. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  That's Peter Nord.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm a faggot.  Look at that.  That's Jeremy, 82.  Oh, that's old school Ron Jeremy.  Yes, you can see the cock.  It's Viagra.  Oh, they're closing the curtains.  That means we get to see this now.  Oh, that's idthroat.com.  There she is.  What a good girl.  All she does is suck dick.  That's all she does.  But the same dick over and over again.  It's always her husband.  I've been looking at a lot of amazing porno lately, and just like a lot of blowjob videos.  I'm just like, I gotta see these chicks, like, take massive amounts of dick. 
[01:43:30]  I don't know why.  I just gotta watch it.  My favorite thing lately is to watch the audition ones.  I don't know if they're real or not, but it's like girls auditioning for porn.  Those have to be fake.  There is no real job, and they're just sucking these guys' dick on cameras.  It just seems so real, though.  If it's fake, good for them.  Is that the ones where they're crying and the fucking mascara's running down their face?  I don't like to cry.  I don't like to cry.  I don't like that.  Do you really?  I don't like to choke.  You're missing out.  That's like watching a game.  Do you chicken and not eat the marrow? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, we're watching a game.  Matt, whenever the ball goes over the fence, I turn it off.  There's this new blowjob sound when the guy just keeps fucking putting it in there over  and over.  There's a great story.  There's a great story that's a true story that I wrote about on my website about this  porno party that I went to.  There's this buddy of mine who was a producer of porn films, and he had this party that he  invited all the guys that I do jujitsu with, and we all went to this porno party, and I'm  like, what the fuck kind of party is this going to be? 
[01:44:30]  This is going to be weird.  So we get there, this guy's showing this porno like it is a work of art and talking about it.  And, you know, it's just this chick's getting fucked.  And right in the middle of this happening, she pulls up in her car and she's with a guy, right?  And the guy gets out and the guy has this look on his face like, what the fuck?  And then she comes over to him.  She goes, oh, I was going to tell you.  And so I'm going, what the fuck is going on here?  So I grabbed the guy.  He had no idea she was a porno star.  He met her at Red Rock.  There's a bar in L.A.  And she goes, do you want to come to a party?  And he says, yes. 
[01:45:00]  He goes to a party.  And she's getting ass to mouth on the screen over and over again.  This guy's fucking her mouth and she's making this otter noise.  And then he's stuffing his dick in her ass.  And it sounds like two chalkboard erasers slapping together.  Smack, smack, smack, smack.  Smack, smack, smack.  And this is what this kid walks into.  He's like 22 years old.  And he's like, what the fuck?  And she told him that she was a makeup artist.  Really?  She is.  In a way.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:45:30]  She's making up for a bad childhood.  Hilarious.  Hilarious story.  So what happened with them?  I know.  Oh, man.  They're still together.  They have children now.  That's pretty good.  I like a good fat one.  Is that IDthroat.com?  No, it's a...  This is a clip from Cum Stained Casting Couch 4.  Oh, there you go.  What's that about?  What that is is shitty parenting.  There you go.  Yeah.  Cum Stained Casting Couch 4.  Look at this guy.  Look at that guy.  What a douche.  Yeah, I'm gonna get my cocks on.  Oh, what a douche.  Look at him with his fucking greasy hair and everything. 
[01:46:00]  That's great.  There's no way to be a guy doing porn and not seem like a douchebag.  Yeah.  Yeah, guys are just not gonna like you.  The videos that I like, my favorite ones of the dudes have their face blurred out.  Like, no, no, you can't see me.  Oh, he's right in there.  Oh, there he goes.  Of course, the obligatory eating the box.  That seems like a waste to me.  Beginning.  Whenever that's in there, what do you...  Ari Shafir, not a fan of the pussy eating.  Yes.  Really?  Not to watch it.  Yeah, I agree.  To watch it.  Yeah, to watch it is kind of like a waste of time on a fucking porno.  Why do you want to see that? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, girls kissing, too.  That does nothing to me.  No.  Get the fuck out of the way.  Yeah.  You know what I really like lately?  The POV stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Where you can feel like it's you.  That's kind of...  You know something?  I kind of like that.  Where the chick is kind of looking like, all right, that's good.  I like also a girl completely naked.  Wow, that's a big dick.  Like, a little bit of a distance looking at the camera.  Look at that black gentleman.  Because then it's like you're walking into the scene, like, I'll be there in a second.  I'm gonna fuck you.  That's goddamn ridiculous.  Look at the size of this guy's dick. 
[01:47:00]  Look at those fucking pictures.  Open up, James.  I think they're real.  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  Is that real?  That's an ad.  That's an ad for...  For what?  For a big black dick.  Ad to bring back slavery.  Jesus Christ.  That's a massive cock.  An ad to bring back slavery.  Ladies and gentlemen, there's some new information that you need to review.  We can't have this on the street.  Here's the options.  We can own it.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, this is one of these... 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, what do you think of the bachelorette party video?  I don't know.  You think...  I think most of them are fake.  Guy goes to a bachelorette party.  It's not fake.  This shit happens for real.  That's why his dick is limp, man.  Guy goes to a bachelorette party.  Those girls suck their dicks all the time.  No one is allowing their faces.  They all have boyfriends have these chicks.  No one's letting all their faces.  Maybe not.  Maybe she's the maid of honor.  No one's blurred out.  That's real.  No one's blurred out.  That's real.  That happens all the time.  I had a buddy in my...  When I was...  Back on my old taekwondo days, one of my friends was a male dancer.  He used to do these parties, and they'd have like three or four girls would suck his dick. 
[01:48:00]  Jerking off in a cup.  Now she's drinking.  Oh, yeah.  That's what happens at bachelorette party.  Shut the fuck up.  They're fucking...  They're all hooting and hollering.  They're all hooting and hollering.  If they want to make it real, they get one cunty-looking girl on the side just going judging with her eyes.  One.  One.  How about all the ones that don't have the dick in their mouth?  Every girl without the dick in their mouth, like, well, you fucking whore.  You're a fucking whore.  I hope you're happy.  And one by one, they'll all be...  I'm not saying I'm going to tell Mike, but someone's going to fucking tell him. 
[01:48:30]  It's an anonymous email from your girlfriend's a slut at yahoo.com.  Fucking Rogan.  That is a funny joke.  Look at that giant dick in front of that chick's face.  What the fuck do you do with that?  I know.  An ad to bring back slavery?  That's the best line ever.  That is crazy.  That can't be.  It's so sad.  That's got it.  There was that movie, The Hangover.  Did you see The Hangover?  I haven't seen that yet.  I saw it.  The Chinese guy gets out of the car.  He's got the micro penis.  They say that's his real penis. 
[01:49:00]  It has to be.  How can you put it on a smaller penis?  Well, you could CGI it.  Oh, that's a good point.  He's actually around today.  Dr. Kerr?  What?  Ken Jeong, the actor.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, he's in everything.  He's around today.  We should get him in.  He's in the studio.  And see if it's a real tiny penis.  Oh, that's so sad.  Could you imagine?  That might be the thing that he gets asked the most right now.  Yeah.  Is that really your small dick?  Dude, he has a ton of bush hair.  And then this tiny little, I don't even know how to describe it.  It's not even that big.  You're being very generous with your fingers right there.  Oap's got his fingers about two inches apart, but that's not true. 
[01:49:30]  It was not even.  An inch, maybe?  Maybe an inch.  Maybe an inch.  Just sort of popping out.  Kind of like a Bobo thing.  Yeah.  Bobo's hung.  Bobo's hung compared to that, the guy from The Hangover.  It was like when you buy canned mushrooms and you get those little ones.  Oh, the tiny little one?  Oh, Jesus.  Who's that?  The guy outside.  Oh, how sad.  Yeah.  Poor fella.  Did you like The Hangover, Joe?  I thought it was hilarious.  I thought so, too.  That movie, they went for it, you know?  Yeah.  There's some movies where there's, you know.  They just got to go for it.  They just went for it.  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  Just go for it.  I think it's turning around and they are, but I haven't.  I didn't see it.  It's a good movie.  It's pretty good.  You know, I mean, it's kind of a tired premise.  You know, they go to Vegas and shit gets crazy.  But they did it right.  They did it right, you know?  Tyson was all right in that movie.  It was fucking good.  It was all right, man.  Fucking Tyson.  Did you see the movie?  Yeah, I did.  You see Tyson documenting?  How disturbing is that?  It was amazing.  That was really good, man.  I didn't like the filmmaking as much.  No, I didn't like how they overlapped.  Thank you.  Yeah.  They didn't need to do that. 
[01:50:30]  It was almost like they were trying to make him seem more fucked up than he is.  Like they were making the voices in his head clash together and he's talking over himself.  They didn't need to do anything.  Just Tyson talking about his life was just fascinating.  I bet you told him that.  You realize he's smarter than we all thought he was.  I bet you he did that just because it's technically without it.  It's just an interview.  Like he probably only did that just to make it have some different element.  That type of artistic.  Then watching.  His vision.  Then just watching a guy who basically put together clips.  That's all it would have been.  No one says scarier shit than Tyson when he's mad at you. 
[01:51:00]  No one has ever said shit like, I'll eat your asshole alive.  I'll fuck you till you love me, faggot.  That was a good one.  Did you hear what he said to one of the guys who reviewed the movie?  One of the guys reviewed the movie and said he was a terrible human being.  All this different.  Really?  Tyson said, I want to stuff garbage in your mother's asshole and light it on fire and put  the fire out with my penis.  That's what he said.  What the fuck?  I mean, there's just very few humans who can think like that. 
[01:51:30]  But only Tyson can get away with saying, I'll fuck you until you love me, faggot.  Like Tyson ain't the faggot.  The guy is the faggot.  Of course.  Well, he's been in jail.  Prison logic.  That's prison logic.  Tyson's fucking him.  Yeah.  He's not the faggot.  He's just showing you who's boss.  Who said he was a terrible person?  That was a great.  Some guy.  What a fucking.  Some guy got mad.  Well, you know, people are always looking for something to fucking complain about.  The guy was so honest in that movie.  I mean, how do you not respect that?  And how do you not respect a kid who's in that horrible environment, you know, the way  he described it as a child, grows up and has this escape through boxing, and that's 
[01:52:00]  what he does.  I mean, it's a fucking scary world.  He was humanized in that movie.  Very much.  And we talked about the movie for a while, and the clip of Tyson saying he doesn't want  to do it anymore almost breaks your heart when you hear that.  Can we play that again?  Yeah.  He's like, I don't have the heart for it.  It's so sad.  So honest.  So honest.  Did you cry when he was talking about Custamato?  Custamato.  Custamato.  Custamato.  Yeah, I dropped a couple of tears.  I was sad watching him talking about Custamato.  And you don't realize that he never saw Tyson as the heavyweight champion.  For some reason, you think that maybe he did see the first year or something, or the 
[01:52:30]  first few months of Tyson on top.  When you remember the Tyson that used to charge out of that corner and just fucking eliminate  somebody, and then you saw him just getting his ass handed to him and saying, I don't  have it anymore.  Yeah, it's weird.  I don't want to fight anymore.  I don't have the heart.  Watch the Marvis Frazier fight.  That was one of the scariest fights in heavyweight history.  Holy shit.  Just stormed out of the gate, just throwing nuclear fucking bombs at that guy's head.  And he was just built like a fucking fire hydrant.  Just bleh.  Yeah, he was...  The Tyson days were fucking frightening, man. 
[01:53:00]  I was charged out of the corner.  This is just fight highlights.  The Tyson days, man.  There's nothing like those...  I mean, it wasn't even...  You didn't even watch a fight.  You weren't going to see someone do well.  You just wanted to see somebody...  Just get destroyed.  And only a couple of punches.  Yeah.  20 seconds.  Boom.  It was like, yeah, I'm seeing a pay-per-view here, and it's going to be over in 20 seconds.  What an animal.  He really was.  Tyson was a great fucking fighter, man.  He was a rare motherfucker.  Absolutely.  I mean, it's almost like that documentary should be shown to people that want to have kids. 
[01:53:30]  Like, this is what happens when you don't raise your fucking kids, you don't give them any  love, and you leave them in a terrible environment.  They become a monster.  You know what's better than the pure knockdown?  Is watching Tyson hit someone, and then the person going, uh-oh, I'm really fucked here.  Like, they're rattled and going, I know he's coming back, and I'm fucked.  I can't even see him.  I just...  I can't see him.  I don't know where he is.  Who did he beat for one of the titles, his first title? 
[01:54:00]  God damn it.  It wasn't Razor Ruddick.  Who the...  I just watched the guy who felt...  Trevor Burbick?  Trevor Burbick.  Yes, fight.  Where he tries to get up.  Did you see his head?  That fucking head snapped back.  Look at this poor motherfucker.  I remember when he lost to Buster Douglas, I didn't watch the fight.  Oh.  Oh.  And then here, take that win, too.  When he lost to Buster Douglas, I didn't watch the fight.  I had a gig, and I thought it was going to be a blowout.  You know, a lot of people thought he was like 41 underdog or something crazy.  And I heard that he got knocked out, and then me and a buddy of mine, they replayed it, 
[01:54:30]  and we watched it the next night at a bar.  And even watching it the next night, knowing what happened, I didn't believe it.  I'm like, he's going to get up.  Yeah.  He's going to knock him out.  Dude, go back to that fat fuck.  Look at this guy.  He gets tagged.  Tony Tubbs.  Oh, that's Tony, yeah.  He gets tagged, and it just kind of goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I didn't even know how fucked up I was.  And he's trying to hit him, even though he knows he's going down.  He did not even know how fucked up he was.  Well, it's a weird thing when you get knocked down.  Your legs, like, stop working.  You know?  It's like, it doesn't even hurt that much. 
[01:55:00]  It's a strange feeling.  It's like your legs just stop working.  They give out.  Jesus.  And you're trying to focus, and...  Yeah, and the eyes are all...  Doink.  The eyes are great.  Bam.  Where they're just looking like, what?  I have no idea where I am.  What the fuck I'm doing here?  Well, everybody else back then was fighting at a certain speed.  It's like everybody was a 45, and Tyson came along, and he was a 78.  Yeah.  Like, yeah.  They just couldn't adjust.  Yeah, they had that old heavyweight kind of, we're just going to sit here and brawl it  out like Brontosaurus.  Yeah, they just... 
[01:55:30]  Even the guys who were good in his day, the Pinklin Thomas guys, they just couldn't compare.  When he got a hold of them, he just smashed them.  The Spinks fight.  God damn, man.  Michael Spinks.  How about the documentary he was talking about?  He was fighting with gonorrhea.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was either from a prostitute or a very, very filthy young lady.  And apparently he's like, and he decided not to deal with it, because that's how the old  fight is where they would just go in there, and it didn't matter.  What?  What the fuck?  He fought with gonorrhea.  Just to go in and fight with that. 
[01:56:00]  It just made him angrier.  That just makes you feel even more like a bitch.  Not only did he knock you out, he knocked you out when he was fucking suffering from gonorrhea.  My dick was painful.  It was very painful.  Scary human, man.  Yeah.  And he had some choice words to say about the woman.  Desiree Washington.  Oh, boy.  That convinced me that he was innocent, though.  Yeah, I agree.  That wretched bitch.  Yeah.  Wretched bitch.  Well, that girl, what they withheld, I'm pretty sure, I don't want to get sued, but  I think she also falsely accused someone of rape when she was 18. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, did she?  She had already done that before, you know?  So they were looking to put him in jail.  He was a scary guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You got to keep him caged up.  That's what they thought.  Keep him caged up until he's not as crazy anymore.  Well, that's Brock Lesnar's the new Mike Tyson.  That's the new thing that you're just, what do you do with that?  Who does Lesnar fight next?  They don't know.  I mean, the Fedor thing, now that it's falling apart, it really sucks.  All because of M1.  All because Dana wouldn't let them co-promote.  He was going to let them fight Samba. 
[01:57:00]  He threw a fucking shitload of money at him.  Yeah, five million a fight, six fights.  Yeah, well, you know, Fedor is owned by his management.  And they take care of him, but they also, you know, they also promote things.  M1 Global, they promote.  So I wasn't there for the, I mean, I'm going to, I'm supposed to sit down with Dana in Philly.  He's going to tell me the whole story, so.  He's calling our show.  Maybe he'll tell us all.  It's a long story, I think.  I don't know if he's going to tell us all.  Yeah, we got time.  Well, we'll see.  We got time.  I think it's Fedor's management.  And he was going to let them hang banners. 
[01:57:30]  He was going to let them wear the shorts.  Yeah, so you can wear M1 Global all of your shorts.  It really is a disappointment.  What a terrible.  It's disappointing.  But I said yesterday, I think it's like casinos, where let's just say that there are silent  partners in casinos, and maybe that they do the books a certain way, and maybe M1's the  same thing.  Well, there's another guy, Giggard Massassi, and he's a top-light heavyweight.  I couldn't say that name if I read it phonetically off the paper.  He supposedly, the word is on the internet that he was told that he got a shitty offer from  the UFC, when in fact the UFC didn't give him an offer at all. 
[01:58:00]  And if they were going to take his affliction contract, they were going to give him what  he got paid in affliction.  And he was told that it was going to be less than half that, and so that he went and fought  with Strikeforce instead, and now he knows he's been deceived.  That's the internet word.  I don't know if it's true.  Who do you think fights Lesnar?  It's very tough.  You've got to get a giant dude.  Shane Carwin?  There's not that many.  Shane Carwin is a good example.  Shane Carwin is going to fight Cain Velasquez, two guys that are all-American wrestlers, real  good.  Shane Carwin is a big guy, too. 
[01:58:30]  He's like 255.  He's not like a small light heavyweight, or a small heavyweight.  He's a big, big guy.  So that's an interesting fight.  Is there any way for them to fight Fedor or Lesnar, even though he's in Strikeforce?  No, they wouldn't do it.  They would never do it.  And they can't.  Strikeforce is just too small of an organization right now.  I mean, I think they put on great fights, but Strikeforce benefits from a deal with M1 Global.  The two of them together, they have Fedor.  It gives them credibility.  They have what a lot of people think is the number one heavyweight.  It helps Strikeforce. 
[01:59:00]  I understand why they would want to do the deal.  For the UFC, it makes no sense.  Why would they co-promote with, first of all, someone who doesn't even have a promotion license  in the United States yet?  I mean, I don't think M1 Global has ever promoted a fight in Vegas.  Jesus.  I mean, and they're going to co-promote with the UFC?  It's crazy for them.  Yeah, and it was like a stupid move for Dana if he did it, you know?  Now they're just going to have to have all the fighters to have straws.  Yeah, you can't do that.  And they just know that Fedor's got this mystique about him, and that's their only ticket to  get something like this.  They're not going to get it with any of these other guys.  He's 33 years old. 
[01:59:30]  I'm going to tell you something.  I wonder if on some level his management was concerned about Lesnar.  Personally, I still think Fedor would beat Lesnar.  I just think he's too experienced.  I'm not sure about that.  I used to think that until the Mere fight, and then I'm like, hmm, with a cage and with  punches and elbows, or elbows especially on the ground, I don't know, man.  You know, I don't know that Fedor could stop Lesnar from taking him down.  And if he's down, and Lesnar has good defense, I mean, Fedor's very good at submitting guys  off their back, but he's very good at submitting guys who make careless mistakes and leave their 
[02:00:00]  arms hanging out.  And Lesnar's not going to do that.  He's hard to submit, though, man.  Yeah, when he fought Noguera when he took the prize title.  I mean Fedor.  Yeah, yeah, like, God damn it.  Like, he fought him, they said he fought him on the ground when everyone said, stay off  the fucking ground.  He stayed on the ground just to beat him on the ground.  Well, guys have beaten Noguera on the ground like that before.  Rico Rodriguez, former UFC heavyweight champion, should have gotten a decision over Noguera,  but they score fights differently in pride.  But Noguera's style, he likes to use double wrist control, and he likes to try to hold 
[02:00:30]  on to guys and submit guys from there.  And that'll work on guys who don't know what you're doing.  But once guys have figured that out, they're like, get off me, bitch.  They're just not going to let you grab their wrist.  And Noguera's style, like, he's like so tough, it almost led to like a worse beating.  And like, it made it even worse.  Because he just took these fucking bombs from Fedor and got his face smashed in.  He got his eye socket broken in that fight, and it was pretty nasty.  Yeah, Fedor was a machine.  He really gave him a beating.  Yeah, and there's fucking Brock.  There's that move when he's hammering.  Yeah, look at him. 
[02:01:00]  Watch when he gets Mir, and he...  Okay, that's the first fight, when they stop the fight due to punches in the back of the head.  He's a scary motherfucker, man.  God damn, he can punch right...  What the fuck?  Right through that shit.  It's amazing.  Look at this, this is the Randy Couture hammer fists.  He's just hammering Couture's face.  And that's, you know, by the way, UFC Hall of Fame former heavyweight and light heavyweight champion.  He's getting crushed.  By, you know, a fake wrestler guy.  Oh, the knee to the side.  Fake wrestler guy, that's funny. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, I mean, that's the WWE guy.  I mean, that's the big knock on him.  But if you look at these guys...  Jesus.  Would you take a knee like that, Jimmy?  No.  I don't know if you have any say in the matter.  Yeah, he doesn't ask.  Yeah, could you knee me in the back?  Hold still.  Hold still.  Do you want this knee?  The thing about this guy is that he was a real, legit amateur wrestling champion.  And then, you know, with a lot of those guys, there's no avenue for them professionally.  So they go into pro wrestling.  Right.  And then he, as he was watching the MMA shit when he was doing pro wrestling, he just decided  to say, fuck it.  I could do that. 
[02:02:00]  I mean, that takes mad balls off.  So he's not some just big jock who didn't have...  Exactly.  He really knows how to fight.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The guy who's the world's strongest man apparently wants to do MMA.  What is it, like, Marius Pujanowski or some fucking shit?  It's always one of those, yeah.  It's like the guys who used to be on the...  A little scary motherfuckers.  What is that?  What was the competition they used to have?  All the guys?  Oh, the strongman competition?  Yeah, the strongest man in the world.  Throwing beer bottles, kegs and shit.  I love that shit.  I love it.  It's so fucked up.  Heister, Merger, Fergen, Stergen, Gergen.  It's always some guy from South Africa, you know. 
[02:02:30]  But who comes up at the events?  It's like, okay, you're going to roll this truck tire a hundred times down the road.  Yeah, but not the round one.  Right, right, right.  You've got to, like, lift it up and flip it.  Push it back over.  The craziest one, they had two ramps and they had handles on these cars.  And they let the emergency brakes go.  And the guy's standing on the top of the two ramps holding these cars from rolling.  And they're stretching them apart.  The faces they make are just like, Gergen!  How does that guy not blow a fucking aneurysm right there?  Really?  We should go to break.  If Travis could find it real fast. 
[02:03:00]  Brian Regan does a really good bit on the strongman competition.  If he could find it real fast, he could play it until break.  We'll continue.  Joe is going to be at Helium Comedy Club tonight.  I think the ticket's got to be really close.  Sold out.  But you might want to give him a call real quick and say 215-496-9001, right?  And then UFC, that sold out?  The UFC sold out, right?  Yeah, it sold out.  So you don't even need to be here today.  That's nice.  I listen.  I was going to put...  I mean, we're flying into Philly.  I flew into New York just to hang out with you guys. 
[02:03:30]  That's fucking cool, man.  100%.  100% of the reason.  That rules.  All right.  I miss you, guys.  I've been around a while.  Dana White at 9.  Jim Jeffries, I believe.  I want to do live from the compound.  Yeah, down in the basement.  I want to come.  I want to come, man.  A couple of beers.  Fucking, yeah.  I'll fly in for that.  You should have fucking...  Fire it up.  You should have came in another day early.  Bring a fucking fan.  It's 300 degrees in that room.  You have everything but an air conditioning unit, you fucking weirdo.  Yeah, really.  It's fucking awful.  It's got everything else except a fan.  Dude, it was sweltering in there.  It's all about lighting, you know?  It's all about lighting. 
[02:04:00]  When we come back, I really do need gun advice.  I really need some Colorado gun advice.  And Joe's living in Colorado.  I want to know about that as well.  Opie and Anthony.  And now, backstage with O.N.A., here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and geriatric stripper Sandy Cain stopped by the Opie and Anthony show  to make a fool of herself.  We found her sitting in E-Rock's office after the show and asked her how it went.  How did it go on O.N.A. today?  Great. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, I mean, because, you know, E-Rock got to smell your privates.  You had your fingers up your ass home.  And working with Nick DiPaolo and Jim Norton and Opie and Anthony and you, Sam, is an honor.  E-Rock, how did it go smelling Sandy Cain's asshole today?  I smelled it, and I think it smelled great.  Yeah.  Do you agree, E-Rock?  Not in the least.  It was horrible.  That bad?  What did it smell like?  What did it smell like?  You know the scene where the kid falls into the toilet in Slumdog Millionaire?  No.  That's what I imagine it smells like.  Oh, okay. 
[02:05:00]  Let's go meet some people, Sandy.  As Sandy quickly ran out of steam, we decided to take her around the Sirius compound to meet some of the folks who work with us here at SiriusXM.  It's Jamie, Covino and Rich's intern that we met before.  This is Sandy Cain.  Hi, Jamie.  Hi, Sandy.  Nice to meet you.  I did not shake hands.  She shoved her fingers up her asshole, so.  Oh, nice.  Good.  How was it?  Smelled good.  It really did.  I still say E-Rock is gay.  Okay.  Any other man would have loved that. 
[02:05:30]  Do you have any opinion, or?  You know what?  I've never actually, like, stuck my own fingers up my butt, but I'm sure if I did, it wouldn't smell as good as yours.  Oh, God.  Thank you.  Okay.  Whoa, it's Cullen from the Jason Ellis show.  Wow.  This is Sandy Cain.  She ripped off the Naked Cowboys thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Did you hear Sandy on the show today?  No.  Sandy, tell them, what was your big accomplishment on the show?  What did I do?  They played my song, He Told Me How to Love, which I'm going down to Nashville. 
[02:06:00]  She also, she put her fingers in her butto.  I'm all class, you know.  Then she spread her cheeks, and she let E-Rock smell what was going on.  Oh, no.  $42.  I made $42.  For $42, she spread her cheeks for E-Rock.  Well, you clearly have a financial plan here.  Sandy, this is Nicole from the morning mashup.  Today, Sandy Cain put her fingers in her butt.  You did?  Yeah.  How'd that work out?  First of all, it was a great show.  They played my song from years ago, and then they played it again. 
[02:06:30]  And then E-Rock smelled her asshole.  Okay, how'd that work out?  Did he enjoy it?  Who cares?  He said it smelled worse than shit.  Oh, dear.  Well, I can't imagine it ever smelling good down there.  Well, it did.  Okay.  I'm sure yours does.  I'm sure.  You're clean.  Get out of your shower over this morning.  Maybe that's what you should have tried.  Well, I did.  Baby Cakes.  Yes.  The weirdo from Sirius.  I forget who you interned for. 
[02:07:00]  This is Sandy Cain.  How are you, Sandy Cain?  Here, this is my flyer.  And I was looking for a handshake.  Shake his hand.  Shake his hand.  Now, while you shake hands with her, you know, she had her fingers in her asshole today.  Oh.  Was it the right finger?  It was the left hand.  Oh, so we're safe.  Okay, right.  It was her right hand.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Did you hear Sandy Cain on the show today?  No, I missed Sandy Cain.  What was your specialty?  Was it just the ass play?  Well, that was the ass I was singing.  He told me he had a love, a great song that was once recorded. 
[02:07:30]  Also, she let E-Rock sniff her asshole.  For $42.  For $42.  As employees mocked her and unpaid interns laughed at her complete lack of pride and self-worth,  Sandy Cain kept moving forward, never losing focus on her dreams of fame and fortune.  Sometimes optimism and idiocy can seem so similar.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show? 
[02:08:00]  Well, Jim Jeffries is making his way into the studio.  We got Joe Rogan playing Helium Comedy Club tonight.  215-496-9001.  Tickets going fast.  Pretty much sold out.  And then, of course, UFC down there in Philly for the first time.  That's huge.  We're all going.  It's going to be a Philly weekend for the boys.  Philly.  Hell yeah.  And Rogan and Anthony talking about guns during the break.  You're discussing some guns.  I tweeted a little picture.  That's what I do.  Oh, look at that.  Of you guys discussing guns.  Look at that. 
[02:08:30]  A candid gun talk.  Not as good as Joe Rogan's, you know, bloody booger pics that he puts up, but I'm trying.  Goddamn, is that disturbing, man?  It's disturbing to me.  It came out of my head.  What's your Twitter?  Because as I said, Joe Rogan.  I'm like, oh, I got to get it.  Joe Rogan, D-O-T-N-E-T.  JoeRogan.net.  See, that's why I can't remember that.  Yeah, it's too...  Well, somebody already had Joe Rogan, and so that's all I could get.  Well, you should beat him up and take your name back.  Probably a nice guy.  Show up at his door.  Maybe a fan.  Guy's probably like, dude, my name's Joe Rogan.  What was I supposed to do?  You know, if he was a fan, he would give it back to you, though.  Maybe.  He's never posted like, FearFucked or LOL. 
[02:09:00]  That's like his only Twitter post that he's ever used.  Have you asked for your name back?  I got like 55,000 people on that.  I don't think they would switch over.  Yeah, I know.  I'm like, hey, I like you guys.  Could you come over to here?  Then I'd have five.  When you tweet, do you get scared that your account might get wiped out because you did  something stupid?  No.  They've never given...  Do people get their accounts wiped out at Twitter?  There's a video.  I'm drinking my piss on Twitter.  I haven't gotten wiped out.  Oh, nice.  Boogers, everything.  The skydiving, the naked broad skydiving video, I want to put the link up on my Twitter. 
[02:09:30]  Why can't you?  People are like, I don't know.  I wouldn't take a chance.  I don't think so.  They might wipe out your account.  If you go to Bella Donna's Twitter, she has links that go immediately to her website  and she writes, you know, NSF, not safe for work, you know?  And you go to it and you get to her site and it's immediately open assholes with cum dripping  out of them.  I mean, that bitch just cuts right to the chase.  Her fucking website is just giant assholes.  Oh my God.  See, I want to tweet this. 
[02:10:00]  She's skydiving.  But look at her pussy.  With the meat curtains.  Just flapping.  You're never going to get all the air out of that pussy.  It's like they fed it peanut butter.  That's like a horse.  Yeah.  So I want to tweet that, but people are like, I don't know.  You can tweet that.  I wouldn't take a chance.  I think it's because of the face.  Don't like that.  Bella Donna's account is still up and she's got, you know, thousands and thousands of members.  Every time she posts a link to her website, it's giant open assholes with cum licking  out of it.  Licking out of it?  Licking out of it.  I think I tweet the video.  Tweet it.  All right.  Tweet it. 
[02:10:30]  Tweet it.  So Joe has some gun questions for Anthony.  I think you might answer all his questions during the break, but.  Yeah, we have to.  Well, no, I didn't.  But yeah, first, you know, you got to figure out.  You're Colorado?  Mm-hmm.  I'm not sure what the laws are there.  Let's start with this.  Just to protect yourself.  Why did Joe move to Colorado?  You're an L.A. guy.  No.  Well, I lived in L.A.  I wanted to mix it up.  I just thought about the idea of living in the mountains.  And then I thought about it and I said, but I can.  I can just fucking do it.  Yeah, you could do that.  Why not?  Why don't I just do it?  And it's one of those things where it's like you could talk about it and then not do anything. 
[02:11:00]  And then it's like you're living the same life.  Or you could just do something fucking crazy and just move to the mountains out of nowhere.  And all of a sudden now you've got this crazy new life.  And I think creatively, like as a comic, I think that's real good for you to just switch  shit up like that.  Move to a totally different environment.  Different stimuli.  Different world.  Most people just wouldn't take that step and do that.  It sounds logical.  You've got to fucking live, man.  I've got gray hair on my balls.  I'm getting old.  You know, you've got to take a chance.  Just fucking do it. 
[02:11:30]  And I just put my money where my mouth is.  Well, this is good.  Permit to purchase a handgun?  No.  Apparently you don't need one.  Nice.  Registration of handguns?  No.  Oh, okay.  Licensing of owners of handguns?  No.  No.  Oh, that's a good state.  To carry handguns, yes.  You need one to conceal.  To conceal.  To conceal.  So you can just walk around with a fucking one on your hip, I gather.  Oh, okay.  So when I walk around my yard to protect myself from scary fucking monsters that live in the  woods.  There are monsters there.  Yeah.  There are monsters.  What kind of monsters? 
[02:12:00]  Wild mountain lions.  There's like fucking signs up all around where I live.  Like if a mountain lion attacks you, fight back.  Bears attack you, you're supposed to play dead.  Right.  But mountain lions are supposed to fight back.  Really?  Yeah.  They'll fucking eat you, man.  Really?  What kind of MMA move do you use on a mountain lion?  First of all, you've got to avoid his paws and you've got to keep away from his, make  sure his jaw doesn't lack on your neck.  You want to avoid the rear naked choke.  Because that's what they do.  They do just like a rear naked choke.  When you see them take out a deer, they grab a hold of the neck and they pin them down and they 
[02:12:30]  cut off the oxygen.  Right.  That's what cats like to do.  Bears are scarier because bears just start eating you.  Bears will try to kill you first.  They're not even fighting.  They just start eating you.  They'll stick to eating.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We don't have to kill them first.  Like yeah, mountain lion will strangle you.  Because they're predators.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the weird thing is omnivores.  Omnivores don't really kill you first.  They just go, oh, I can eat you.  It's a bush.  I'll eat you.  You're just like a berry.  You're like a berry on a bush.  It's just, I'll, I'm alive!  There's a terrifying video of a bear that caught a moose and just starts to 
[02:13:00]  eating the moose from the guts first.  Oh, shit!  Just starts digging into this moose's guts.  And the moose's legs are kicking.  The bear's just making a moose.  Just ripping his fucking guts apart.  Making a moose.  It's online.  It's online.  Let's go, let's find that video.  There's another great one online, very similar, where a chimp is eating a monkey.  I don't know if you've ever seen these.  Chimps love to eat monkeys.  And when they eat monkeys, they just eat them.  They just grab them, hold them, and start eating them.  And the chimp is eating this monkey from like the asshole first.  Jesus.  If you watch Google on YouTube, chimp eats monkey. 
[02:13:30]  There's a link to it on JoeRogan.net on my website somewhere.  Go to JoeRogan.net.  I don't know where it is, though.  Get some more people checking out their website.  The inner chimp.  You know how to run a website, Joe.  Well, I just try to update it as much as possible.  A little of everything.  A little lax lately.  And speaking of porno on Twitter, we got Mersh checking in.  Mersh.  Ew.  Hey, buddy.  Yeah, I wanted to let you guys know Razor Roman turned me on to, it's at Tweet Me Some Skin.  And this dude just compiles just hot chicks just doing all kinds of lovely, naughty things. 
[02:14:00]  And you guys got to check it out.  Wood Floor Liquor and I spent hours yesterday.  You can get so desensitized from the internet.  It's so easy.  Never.  Never.  There's always something to find.  And I mean, oh, they're just hot college girls and like summer porn stars.  It's great.  So it's one word, Tweet Me Some Skin on Twitter.  Yes, it's at Tweet Me Some Skin.  Fuck, that account's going to blow up today, huh? 
[02:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  Totally worth checking out.  Jesus, I'm there.  Thank you, sir.  And you can also go to at Mersh.  I'm slipping that in there.  What the hell?  Boom.  Ooh, how dare you, sir?  How dare you try to get some Twitter friends?  I love you.  Yeah, this is the one where the chimp kills and eats a monkey.  Watch this shit.  Wow.  It's very disturbing because they're very organized in how they chase these monkeys.  What they do is some chimps make a lot of noise.  They start chasing them and they chase them into these other chimps that are waiting and  then there's like this mad scramble and they catch them and when they catch them, they 
[02:15:00]  just start fucking ripping them apart and eating them alive because they don't kill them  first.  Is there some volume?  Chimps are fucking scary, man.  Oh, my God.  The way they throw themselves through the air, too.  Now, look at them to get all excited because they got one.  Now, there's the monkey.  Look, they're ripping it apart, eating it alive.  Look at that.  Holy shit.  They're just eating them.  See the monkey screaming and shit?  Look, they're just eating them.  See how they're just pulling them apart?  Yeah, they don't kill them first. 
[02:15:30]  That's our ancestors.  Well, you want to know why people are so fucked up?  Watch this.  Holy shit.  Look at that.  They're just eating that thing.  That thing's still alive.  Ripping it apart.  Biting it.  Asshole first.  Look at that.  Just eating chunks of monkey.  Now, look.  Everyone's calm.  I'm just eating the remains.  You know, they didn't even know that monkeys did, that chimps did shit like this.  They had no idea until they got this footage.  Yeah, they thought they were just like peaceful little berry eaters and beat them.  Give them a banana. 
[02:16:00]  Give them a banana.  Put them in a little engineer costume with a hat on.  Yeah, forget people having guns.  How about that fucking crazy bitch in Connecticut that had one of these subhuman super fucking  primates in a diaper?  Like a retard strength.  Holy fuck, a retard strength.  They're like five men.  Giving it Valium and Xanax.  Yeah, and sleeping with it.  He's a fucking fake boyfriend.  She was giving him wine.  That was fucked up.  And it ate the woman's face.  Ate her hands.  Ate her face.  Ate her eyeballs.  And that other guy that was with the woman that went to give a birthday cake to the fucking 
[02:16:30]  That's California, right?  Yeah.  Ate his fucking balls.  Ate his fucking balls.  Ate his fucking balls.  They're intelligent.  They go for stuff that's going to hurt you, like your fingers.  They go for what makes you a human.  Yeah, yeah.  They take your hands away.  Taking your hands away.  Take your face away.  You're never going to breed again because I'm going to rip your fucking testicles off.  With your fucking teeth.  An intelligent thing trying to eat your dick.  And it's straight to 500 pound man.  But it's not quite intelligent enough to go, could you stop eating me? 
[02:17:00]  And have it go, okay, sir.  Well, yeah.  There's no communication.  Yeah, nothing.  It's like the Terminator.  It can't be reasoned to.  It can't be bargained with.  Dude, I want to go back to the subject, but we have Dana White on the phone, and he can't  wait around.  He can't wait around through this nonsense.  Dana.  Dana.  My God.  What are you guys talking about?  What's happening, brother?  Watching chimpanzees eat a monkey.  Hey, Dana.  What I'm trying to do is desensitize people to UFC violence.  I'm trying to show them real fucked up shit in the world so they don't think that the  UFC is violent.  Exactly.  Dana. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, Rogan, you're the best.  And you take care of Rogan, right?  You're the best, sir.  Come on, man.  Of course he does.  All right.  I want to make sure.  I love working for the UFC.  Fucking Rogan, he's perfect for you, Dana.  I know that.  You know that.  I know.  It's the only reason we watch.  He's the one who talked me into doing it.  When I met Dana, I was doing Fear Factor, and he's the one who talked me into doing commentary.  I was like, come on, man.  You know what happened?  When we bought the company, I actually flew to New York and started packing up all the  tapes and all the things that we now own.  There was so many tapes and everything.  And there was this tape. 
[02:18:00]  There was this VHS tape of Joe Rogan on the Ivory Keenan Wayans talk show.  You remember that show?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he was talking about, they asked him, Ivory Keenan Wayans asked him, so you're into  this UFC thing, huh?  You're a UFC fan.  And how do you think Steven Seagal would do in there?  And Joe just starts going off on, you know, they would grab his ponytail and start beating  him.  It was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen. 
[02:18:30]  I said, this is the kind of guy we need to be with the UFC.  And that was how Rogan and I started talking.  What kind of a person who owns an organization like that looks at a video like that and goes,  oh, yeah, we need that guy talking for us.  We need that fucking idiot talking for us.  I do a joke about it in my act that I accidentally said rape choke during a broadcast once.  It was a total accident because I say it on stage all the time.  Yeah.  But there was a fight once where Matt Hamill grabbed Tim Bosch and he grabbed him by the  neck like he was going to rape.  And I go, oh, he's got the rape choke.  Right after I said it, I was like, what the fuck did I just say? 
[02:19:00]  And the joke of my act, it was like, if someone was going to come up to me after the show going,  why did you say rape choke on TV?  I'd be like, why did you let a pothead comedian name your fucking moves?  You got this multi-million, hundred million dollar organization.  You got me talking for you?  What are you fucking crazy?  But really, I mean, that's the beauty of this organization is that like Dana, much like  me, is really like a fan.  He's like a huge, huge fan of the sport.  And somehow or another, the inmates are running the asylum, you know?  Which is great because you could tell it's like regular guys doing this, not these smarmy 
[02:19:30]  business type or announcers and things like that.  It's regular guys talking like regular guys talk.  Well, if you want to see regular guys, watch Dana's video blog.  Then you get to know what he's really all about, you know?  I mean, he's a regular dude that somehow or another is running this crazy giant company.  Not even a regular dude because a regular dude wouldn't put in the hours that Dana puts in.  Hey, Dana, I know you're probably sick of it, but could you give us just a minute on the 
[02:20:00]  Fedor thing, please?  Yeah, obviously, you know, all the stuff has been going back and forth.  I really wanted to sign this guy.  We went after him big time.  Me and Lorenzo basically walked into that negotiation ready to make this deal, and I was confident  that it was going to happen.  You know, we had just done the affliction thing and worked everything out with those  guys, just renegotiated with Tito and got Tito back, and everybody knows how bad that  was between Tito and I. 
[02:20:30]  No kidding.  You know, all the things, I was confident that we were going to get this deal done,  and I knew it was going to get done, and nope, didn't get done.  He ends up turning down our offer and signing with, you know, this small company that has  nobody for him to fight.  And Dana, what's the story with Gegard Mousasi?  Because that's another one where Gegard was saying that he was told that the UFC gave him  a shitty offer, and then Joe Silva has been quoted as saying they never gave him any offer, 
[02:21:00]  and if they were going to take him from the affliction deal, they would have honored his  affliction contract.  Absolutely right.  The guys that we got from affliction and the deal that we did with them, you know, however  many fights they had, at whatever number it was, that's what they would have got paid.  And apparently they lied to him and told him that we offered him much less, or we tried  to renegotiate the deal, which is something we don't do anyway.  Which sucks, because that kid is very talented.  I really wanted to see him in the UFC, and we could have used him in the light heavyweight 
[02:21:30]  division.  Because he wanted to be in the UFC.  Yeah, that's a mess.  I mean, if you had the opportunity to leave and go to the UFC, do you really want to end  up in that other organization?  No, you don't.  You know, it's one of those unfortunate things in this business, you know.  Some bad people in the fight business, there has been for a long time, and that's one of  the things that we've tried to clean up, but what are you going to do?  Dan, what do you think it is that kind of kept, I mean, it was obviously M1 was the  big problem.  Why are they being so unreasonable?  Like, why wouldn't you want to fight? 
[02:22:00]  They want to be the next UFC.  If they want to co-promote, right?  That's their big demand, is they want to co-promote?  Yeah.  Yep.  50-50, they want to split the promotion.  When they put together the M1 Global here in the United States, they went out of business  before they ever even put on one show.  They hired all these guys and built this infrastructure to put on this show here in the United States.  They went out of business before they even put on one show.  But, you know, they've got one guy, one guy, Fedor, and they want to build this company. 
[02:22:30]  You know, I'm so disappointed that that deal couldn't be made because I am not convinced  that he would be successful with that ring, not fighting in the ring, fighting in the cage  and fighting with elbows and fighting a guy as big and as powerful as Lesnar.  I'm not convinced.  I don't know how that would have worked out.  Well, it's one of those things where we were just saying, you know, at the end of the  day, we're big fight fans, you know, we know how the fans feel, and people want to see 
[02:23:00]  this fight.  Fuck yeah.  So we did everything we could to try to make this fight happen.  I'll give you another example.  When we announced the fight in Dallas, it was supposed to be Dan Henderson and Rich Franklin.  They fought a controversial fight in Ireland, and it was a split decision.  And so we said, you know, we could do the rematch of this fight.  The fans went crazy, flipped out, and said they didn't want to see that fight.  So we yanked it, and we put Vitor Belfort in there against Rich Franklin, you know.  We're the kind of guys that, you know, I feel like my job is to put on fights that the fans 
[02:23:30]  want to see.  That's my job.  And the fans wanted to see that other fight.  I tried to make it happen and couldn't.  But I'm still willing to make a deal with him if he wants to come back to the table.  Is there a way for that to happen?  It's up to them.  For him, it'd be so huge.  The ball is 100% in their court.  If he could beat Lesnar, holy shit, that would cement his legacy.  That would be just gigantic.  But how could they do it if he signed another deal? 
[02:24:00]  Yep, and it cements Lesnar's, too.  You know, for Lesnar to have that fight.  It was perfect.  Everyone knew how perfect that was.  Everyone wanted to see that one, man.  But, Dan, how could that possibly happen if he signed with Strikeforce?  Because, you know what, Strikeforce is a small, tiny, little regional show.  You know what I mean?  Right.  And what are they going to do?  These guys, everybody else, if you look at all the competition in the past, they've all 
[02:24:30]  gone out of business, every one of them.  And you're talking about real smart guys that have a lot of money.  And they're gone.  And that's what's going to happen to these guys, too.  And we'll end up with them.  Didn't Fedor look as much as people like him?  I read that he did less than 300,000 pay-per-views total combined on those three events.  Like, he's not the draw that Lesnar or anybody in the UFC is.  No, no, no.  He's not a draw at all here in the United States.  But the hardcore fans that like this guy and have followed him, you know, they want to see him fight. 
[02:25:00]  And, you know, I think that buzz has spilled over into the mainstream and definitely with  the...  Plus, you want to know the truth, you know, people love to talk about the guy that we don't  have.  Sure.  If I had him, nobody would give a shit about him.  But because I don't have him, you know, it's a big deal.  And, well, that's just a stupid move by his people.  It sucks because besides Alistair Overeem, you know, and a couple other guys, they have 
[02:25:30]  Fabrizio Verdun, former UFC guy.  There's not that many guys for him to fight over there either.  There's not that much competition in Strikeforce.  He fought the last three guys that were available.  The last three good guys.  Or two and a steroid.  It sucks.  What's going to happen to Josh Barnett?  He's fucked.  Is he really?  Yeah.  This is his third positive steroid test.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  It's very unfortunate.  I don't know.  The California State Athletic Commission, a lot of people dispute their claims. 
[02:26:00]  I don't know, you know, how they do their testing or what happens.  But when you get popped three times, that ain't good.  So is his career ruined?  He's ruined in the United States.  I mean, not ruined forever.  But, I mean, you can't shake that.  Yeah, that's true.  He's in a lot of trouble.  He's a talented guy, too.  It's very unfortunate.  That would have been a really interesting fight, him and Fedor.  That would have been really interesting.  But, yeah, you know, three times?  Fuck.  I mean, he's going to.  Who knows?  He's going to fight it.  Has anybody ever won against a steroid accusation in court? 
[02:26:30]  No.  That was the problem.  That was the problem with him.  He fought in the UFC.  Right.  And he tested positive for steroids.  Twice.  And, listen, I'm the type of guy.  We all make mistakes, man.  I've made mistakes.  You know, everybody makes mistakes.  We're all human beings.  And the thing with me is it's how you deal with it.  Do you step up like a man and admit and accept it?  And how do you deal with it?  This guy gets busted for steroids, and he goes into the Athletic Commission hearing 
[02:27:00]  and basically starts saying it's a conspiracy between the Athletic Commission and the UFC.  He never took steroids.  And that's how he left the UFC.  But he tested hot.  Once he did that, I washed my hands of Josh Barnett.  Didn't.  See you later.  Then he does it again in California, and he's basically saying the same thing.  He's denying it.  But he tested hot when you guys did tests before it was ever announced, right?  When they weren't even banning guys for steroids.  And then he tested hot after he beat Randy. 
[02:27:30]  Right.  Exactly.  So that was two hot tests in the UFC, and then the other one, the California State Athletic Commission, got him.  And you're right.  That was before the whole steroid craze, too.  Yeah.  So there was no...  Everybody went crazy.  It wasn't even made public that he tested hot the first time.  But what about guys that say that if you buy stuff at, like, GNC, that some of that stuff you'll test positive for?  Right.  Some of those test boosters and shit.  There's a lot of people that say that.  Yeah.  A lot of...  Yeah, I think that is true.  I think that, you know, some of the stuff that...  I don't know how much...  So it could just be that he took some over-the-counter shit. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, I don't know how much that is now, but, you know, back then, it was...  You know, if you took some of the stuff that they had in, like, GNC, it was doing that to guys.  They used to have this shit called Mag10.  I bought this shit at GMC once.  Holy shit.  My dick was hard 24 hours a day.  Really?  And I was like a raging chimpanzee.  It was straight steroids.  But you could buy it at GNC.  So I'm like, I'm just buying a supplement.  I was taking six of these pills a day.  You'd have to take six of them.  And there was clear pills.  They tasted like battery acid. 
[02:28:30]  It tasted fucking horrible.  But goddamn, I gained 10 pounds of muscle in, like, four or five weeks.  10 pounds of muscle, and I was like a raging chimp.  It was nuts.  So you know what they had to do back then, Joe?  All the fighters had to...  If you were taking some supplements, you know, that you got over-the-counter or whatever it was,  you had to...  List it.  You had to disclose it to the Athletic Commission.  And they used to do these tests on this stuff to find out, you know,  what it had in it.  So he didn't do that. 
[02:29:00]  He didn't, you know, say, oh, I'm taking this or that.  Sean Shirk did.  When Sean Shirk tested, Sean Shirk gave them a list of 900 supplements that he was taking.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And do you think Sean Shirk's situation was that he was taking an over-counter thing  and he just accidentally tested positive for it?  I think it's possible.  You know, listen, you and I have both known Sean Shirk for a long time.  I like that kid.  I respect him.  And he said he didn't.  And, you know, we've had tons of conversations where, you know, he says,  Dane, I'm telling you right now, I'd admit it. 
[02:29:30]  So I believe him.  Yeah, I think there's a lot of things that you can take that you could just buy  at a health food or a vitamin store that'll make you test positive for steroids.  Yeah, it's going to test positive, yeah.  Did I miss the...  I missed the beginning of the call.  I was taking what was...  I want to say it was a life-changing shit.  I actually missed the beginning.  Did you guys cover Tito?  Well, I wanted to ask Dana about that very briefly.  I wanted to ask Dana how awkward was that, talking to Tito again.  And who reached out?  And how did you get past it? 
[02:30:00]  I mean, there was a lot of bad blood between you two.  It was bad.  I mean, we had to listen to both sides of that.  We had Dana on the phone, then we had Tito in one day.  Here's the thing is that he and I go way back before we owned the UFC, before 2001,  and we had a mutual friend.  And our mutual friend came to me and started talking to me about Tito and me and Tito.  And, you know, I wanted nothing to do with it.  I didn't even want to hear about it.  And he just kept going and going and going and going. 
[02:30:30]  Finally, he got me to a place where he's like, you know,  you guys should at least get into a room together and talk.  And he set that up the week of UFC 100.  So Tito came in.  It was not good.  It was a really awkward, weird meeting.  We met and talked about a lot of shit.  And then we, I don't know, after we talked and we met, I literally started to get over it. 
[02:31:00]  I really started to get over it.  I said, this is so stupid.  And I'm over this whole thing with him.  And it went back and forth.  And then finally Lorenzo and I flew down to Huntington Beach and met with him at his house.  And that meeting was a great meeting.  And we figured it out and moved on.  And, you know, we're both over it.  Was Brock with you when you?  He was behind him with a fucking dog collar on him.  And, well, that's pretty cool. 
[02:31:30]  Tito's back.  Tito is a talented fighter.  The bottom line is if you look at, like, you know, like the top light heavyweights, like, look at Lyoto Machida.  Tito almost caught him in a fucking triangle off of his back.  You know, that's a real, he was getting his ass kicked in that fight, but he hung in there.  And even in the last round, threw up a triangle and had it locked up on Machida.  When do we see Tito fighting?  Tito had back surgery, and it was 100% successful. 
[02:32:00]  So he is going to start training hardcore now, and he'll be back in either December or January.  You guys, are you having to fight Mark Coleman?  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  He's going to fight a good fight.  Fuck yeah, that's a good fight.  That's a dangerous fight for Tito.  He better not take Mark Coleman lightly.  A lot of guys, they sleep on Mark Coleman because he's, like, 45 years old.  That dude's got that old man strength.  He's got that fucking old man wrestler strength.  Because Stefan Bonner's no joke, and Coleman beat the fuck out of him for three rounds.  First round was close. 
[02:32:30]  The second and third rounds was Coleman on top of Stefan Bonner, punching his face in.  He's a beast, man.  He's, uh, and, and, you know, everybody was thinking when, when Coleman came back,  oh, Coleman's here, he's going to get a paycheck.  Coleman comes to fight, man.  Coleman had a, had a knockdown, drag him out, war with Shogun, too.  If he was in better condition, I think he could have stopped Shogun in that fight.  You know, he just wasn't getting any training.  And he actually trained for the Stefan Bonner fight, had a real strength and conditioning  program, came in in great shape, and now he's got confidence behind him. 
[02:33:00]  That's a tough fight for Tito.  It's a dangerous fight.  Because if he loses to Mark Coleman, Mark Coleman is the original UFC heavyweight champion.  Back in the fucking days of no gloves, headbutts.  That was his number one move.  He used to get guys down and fucking headbutt them.  Smash his face into their face.  How do you, how do you fight a guy like that who's using his face as a fist?  You gotta learn how to do this.  You gotta learn how to tap.  It's very important.  Yeah.  I, I got so much to learn about UFC, but I'm in.  I'm all in now.  Opie's down for this weekend.  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  Opie and Anthony's got like 93 tickets to this thing.  I knew that was going to come up.  Because Kenny's like asking for tickets every other day.  Oh, it's so brutal.  I got back to Dana.  That's not good.  It's like so many people are interested.  I'm happy we're here so you guys can finally come.  You guys are going to have a blast.  I've never seen anything like it.  The live event.  Watching it on television is fucking awesome because you get the replays and you get the  commentary.  But watching a live event, hearing the smack of a fucking shin that slams against a guy's 
[02:34:00]  head and knocks him out, and feeling the energy in the audience, there's nothing like  it.  Nothing.  I just can't wait.  Nothing like it in all of sports.  It's just, it eclipses everything.  Every other sporting event you go into is going to feel boring after this.  I can't believe we're on Dana White's radar with our ticket.  I know.  You know, it is on.  It stands on.  Dude, it just goes to show you that there's so many people that want to see this.  Yeah.  Like, I can't remember, I was saying this for 100, I can't remember the last time I ordered  a pay-per-view for any event. 
[02:34:30]  Seriously.  And for 100, I'm like, I gotta fucking see this.  That was an awesome event.  And it was the first pay-per-view I ordered in years for anything.  I can't even tell you what the other one was.  What were the numbers on that, Dana?  Did you get the numbers?  It had to be huge.  Can you say?  He just laughs.  He's laughing and he's on his way to the bank.  Let's just say that.  If he got more than 1.5 million, he was supposed to base jump off of Mandalay Bay.  Oh, really?  Base jumping off Mandalay Bay.  Are you base jumping?  Yeah.  Are you really going to do it?  Yeah, I'm really doing it. 
[02:35:00]  I'm talking to him.  Listen, I said I'd do it.  I think he'd get to do that.  I did the reporters and now they're busting my balls, so I'm going to do it.  Holy shit.  That's crazy, man.  Joe, why don't you go with him?  No, that's fucking good.  I'm good.  I'll be there with my little iPhone at the bottom taking the video.  That's crazy, man.  Why would you make that bet when you're making all this?  Make a safe bet.  Like, oh, I'll eat my hat or I'll do something nutty.  Eat my hat.  What, you want him to do a mayor's bet?  Well, I'm going to tell you something.  If you die, I quit. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, that's it.  If you die, base jumping, I'm done.  I'm going back to comedy only.  Well, let me tell you who's in charge now.  Yeah, Brock Lesnar, UFC heavyweight champion and president.  And Dana.  I also read this morning that Kimo Slice is going to be a contestant on Ultimate Fighter.  Yeah, he's on this season, which starts in September.  He, you know, everybody knows all the shit that I talked about him.  And he, people used to say, when's he going to get in the UFC? 
[02:36:00]  And I said, the only way this guy will ever get in the UFC is if he goes on the Ultimate Fighter and wins it.  And I never expected him to take me up on that offer.  He did, and here we go.  It's good on his part, too, because Gary Shaw was offering him boxing.  They were offering him boxing bouts, and they were going to try to promote him.  So it's good that he stepped up and took a chance like that.  You don't really respect him yet, do you, Kimbo?  No, listen, I respect him.  He stepped up and accepted the challenge. 
[02:36:30]  So, yeah.  I guess maybe that's not what I should have said.  I mean, you don't think he could beat any guys in the UFC at this point, though, right?  No.  When he popped up on CBS and, you know, this backyard fighting sensation, no, I absolutely  not.  But, man, how depressed was CBS?  One fucking knockout and that whole thing come on.  I called that fight.  I called that fight on YouTube.  We were at the Punchline in Atlanta.  Really?  And Ari and I, we were backstage.  And I got off stage.  I just got off stage.  And I said, what happened in the Kimbo fight? 
[02:37:00]  They said, Ken Shamrock isn't fighting.  They got some other guy to fight him.  I go, what the fuck are you talking about?  They go, Ken Shamrock got caught.  I'm like, you've got to be fucking kidding me.  So I'm sitting there watching on TV and Seth Petruzzelli comes on.  I go, oh, he's fucked.  I go, Seth Petruzzelli's going to kill him.  I go, he's going to fucking kick his ass for sure.  For sure.  Petruzzelli, and by the way, Petruzzelli lost on the UFC every fight he had.  I mean, didn't he, Dana?  I mean, he fought on the Ultimate Fighter and then he got a couple, he lost to Matt Hamill.  But he's a very talented guy.  But the depth of talent in the UFC is so deep that even a really talented guy like Petruzzelli, 
[02:37:30]  you know, you're going to lose to the top guys.  But he got in there with Kimbo and I was like, Kimbo's fucked.  He's got almost no chance.  This kid has got, Petruzzelli had over 30 fights.  See, that's the difference between you and I.  I bought into the hype and when Kimbo's slice went down, I thought it was a Buster Douglas moment.  The best Kimbo fight ever was him versus Sean Gannon.  And Sean Gannon is a cop who also fought in the UFC.  He's a cop from Boston.  And they had a no-rules fight in a fucking dojo. 
[02:38:00]  I think it was in Rhode Island.  And guys came up from Miami with like 10,000 bucks in a fucking suitcase.  And guys came down from Boston.  They met at this dojo.  And you can watch it on, it's on the internet.  The depression.  It was on pay-per-view.  You could buy it.  I bought it on pay-per-view so you could watch it on the internet.  Like 10 bucks or something like that.  And Gannon beat him, right?  Yeah, Gannon wore him out.  It was a fucking, when they had a 30-second count.  When the guy would go down, they would count to 30.  What kind of fucking brain damage are you getting? 
[02:38:30]  Well, you can like get up at 28, 29, and then you get beaten down again.  It's a fucking phenomenal fight.  Was that one and done?  They don't do that type of fighting anymore?  Well, it was bare knuckle.  It was a sparring match.  Because Gannon was a Boston police officer.  Didn't he lose his job?  Yeah, they suspended him.  He was on the page of the paper every day.  It was a big deal.  Let me tell you something.  Gannon, that dude is all heart.  That guy has the heart of a fucking lion.  Because he took a beat.  His fucking head was so grotesquely swollen after the fight. 
[02:39:00]  Because they're bare knuckle punches.  Kimbo with those giant fucking, they look like brick knuckles.  He's punching him in the face.  Gannon's head is just like, you remember when Evander Holyfield fought Hasim Rahman?  And they collided heads and Rahman had this gigantic hematoma?  That gigantic fucking Gumby bump on his head.  That wasn't shit.  Gannon had those all over his head.  And he still managed to beat Kimbo down and stop him.  It was a fucking phenomenal fight.  Dana, I have to complain to you a little bit. 
[02:39:30]  I play USC Undisputed.  And you don't answer any of my emails.  You send them to me.  It says you have an email from Dana White.  You get excited, right?  And I get all excited and I try to answer you back and you never write back to me.  And you keep hooking me up with people that kick my ass and telling me, hey, could you, you know, why train for nine weeks against the sap that you picked?  Train for three against this guy and it'll put you in a real good position. 
[02:40:00]  I'm like, okay.  Oh, it's Tito.  Watch.  I'm on the ground.  Get my head.  But at least he figured out the video game boob.  Yes.  Yes.  I was also.  Video game boobies, man.  You mastered that one.  It's probably the best video game breasts I've ever seen on a video game, obviously.  Here it is.  Yeah.  That's the Kimbo Gannon fight.  Wow.  There it is.  Look at you.  You got it at the end when you see his face.  Holy shit.  Hey, Dana, how much press does Brock do in New York?  We would love to have Brock come in.  Does he come to New York at all due press?  Once you get him out of the woods. 
[02:40:30]  He's going to leave a trail of steak.  You know where he lives?  Do you guys know the story behind him?  He lives in Minnesota in the woods, okay?  He's got a fucking house in the woods.  He only got cable so that he can watch hunting shows.  And he doesn't have an internet.  He doesn't have a computer.  And when he's not training, he's shooting animals.  That's what he does.  He hunts.  He won't turn his cell phone on.  This guy literally lives out in the middle of the woods.  That's kind of like bliss. 
[02:41:00]  That's kind of nice, though.  I'm telling you.  I'm not kidding either.  If I sent him to New York and I got him to do this and he went in and did your show,  he'd scare the shit out of you guys.  Why?  Serious.  He would.  I think he'd be very entertaining to talk to because he's a very interesting dude.  I would love to have him.  He's a very nice guy.  I had dinner with him when he first came down to the UFC when he was thinking about joining  and he was talking to Dana.  I sat down and had dinner with him and his buddy.  I'm going to have to pick up the check.  He picked it up.  He's a very nice guy.  I'm just saying he must eat a lot.  Yeah.  Big boy. 
[02:41:30]  Big slabs of meat.  That's wild.  He lives in the woods.  Where do I get a good steak?  Jesus.  Is it just a small town in the middle of Minnesota?  Yeah.  Yep.  Lorenzo and I flew out there a week before.  That's amazing.  He's like a fucking character in a movie.  He's like in Vision Quest.  He's the guy that you don't want to fight.  He lives in the woods, trains all day.  Where's Block?  He's carrying a fucking log up the stairs.  A little Rocky action.  Rocky training for...  You think you'll make the weight?  You know?  So you think...  Now you think he would be very scary to sit next to and talk to? 
[02:42:00]  Do you think we'd confront him?  He's scared to interview.  He scares the fuck out of me when I interview him.  He has his moments, man, where he's just, you know...  Yeah, he'd scare you.  Yeah, but he hasn't met us yet.  Let's start talking shit.  Before he comes in open, be doing push-ups, trying to pump up.  We're not exactly going to be confrontational.  We'll just agree with whatever he says.  We're not fucking idiots.  Yeah, you're the guy that's got to be confrontational with him every so often.  What was it like going backstage and talking to him after he did that whole thing where 
[02:42:30]  he's shitting on Bud Light, talking about Coors Light, and he got in Frank Mir's face  after he smashed him?  What was that conversation like?  No, that wasn't a good one, but I was so mad and so upset that I wasn't thinking straight.  You're going to walk out of there like fucking Siegfried and Roy one day.  You're going to bite your head off and you're going to be in a coma.  It's like when I used to have pit bulls, every now and then I'd have to yell at him, like  if one killed a cat or something like that, I'd have to yell at him.  But I'd be in the middle of yelling at my pit bull going, what if he just decides to  fucking jump on me?  Take your throat out.  What the fuck are we going to do? 
[02:43:00]  I thought you were going to say he was going to walk out like Vince McMahon did.  Oh, with the black eye.  You guys seen that video, right?  Who was it?  Was it Brett?  Who punched Vince McMahon behind closed doors?  Is this somebody we had in?  Oh, Brett Hart, right.  And Vince, it was a documentary they were filming, so they had cameras, but not inside the locker  room.  But right when Vince walked out, he was like shaky on his feet.  He was wobbling.  He had a black eye.  Yeah, he got fucking popped by Brett Hart.  Especially that sucks if you walk in and yell at Brock and he thinks he did good, like, 
[02:43:30]  wasn't that great what I did?  You're like, ah, correction.  Yeah, the whole part up until you shit on the sponsor.  The whole part up until when you pulled his cup off and raped him.  But you know what, though, dude?  I like Lesnar now.  After the press conference, when he came out, and then you kind of saw what kind of guy  he was, like, where he wasn't all hyped up and being an animal.  It was like, he's like a likable dude.  It's like, all right, I could kind of want to see this guy.  He's a very likable guy.  I just picture he's got to be led around by that guy that took care of the velociraptors  in Jurassic Park.  You know, every so often you've got to shoot a dart in an electric cage. 
[02:44:00]  You throw a goat over, you lower a goat on a crane.  Yeah.  That's like a beat of it.  Fuck it.  Fucking Brock Lesnar.  You don't seem to have that.  Like, with him, there's certain guys you talk to, like, who I have not met him, but Tyson  I've met a couple of times.  There's that whole weird thing with a guy like that, where even though you know that  they're professionals, you're afraid that they may not, like, that won't stop them from  punching you in the face.  It's like, you can't talk shit to a guy like that and think, well, he's a professional.  He wouldn't dare punch me in the face.  Why would you talk shit to him?  We felt that way with some of the UFC guys that came in that we were on good terms with. 
[02:44:30]  Liddell was intimidating as hell.  Rampage Jackson was ridiculous.  Well, you've got to think about the world those guys live in.  Forrest Griffith was ridiculous.  You use your body as a weapon to try to subdue another trained killer.  You know, you're not just beating up some regular dude.  You're beating up another fucking assassin.  Yeah.  Right.  You know, that's what you're, you're the best assassin.  You're the best at beating up other assassins with your fucking body.  That's insanity.  That's a crazy world.  It really is.  Most people could never possibly understand the pressure, the stress, the intensity that's 
[02:45:00]  involved in something like that.  So when you're around a dude like that.  When you see him coming out, walking out, getting, you know, ready to get in that octagon  down there, it's insanity to think like, what, what's going through their minds?  Just, I got, I'm going to get in here and get either smashed or have to nearly kill somebody.  It takes extreme confidence.  My favorite guy, the walkout guy is Diego Sanchez.  Cause Diego walks out.  He's an Anthony Robbins guy.  He loves Anthony Robbins.  Oh really?  And he's really into like yoga and meditation. 
[02:45:30]  And he comes out and he's screaming, yes, yes, yes.  It's fucking psycho shit.  You see him walking to the octagon and he's frothing at the mouth, his mouthpiece in.  And he's got his fists up and he's going, yes, yes, yes.  He's trying to work himself into peak condition.  I can't wait for tomorrow, man.  Fuck yeah.  Hey Dana, Dana, you got Philly done.  What's going on with New York?  That's the, one of the last cities you need.  Yep.  We're, uh, we're working on New York.  I'm very confident we're getting it done. 
[02:46:00]  We're getting it done, uh, a time period this year.  Yeah.  We'll get it done this year.  Holy shit.  We're going to do New York.  We're going to do Boston.  Uh, you don't have Boston yet.  Not here.  Yeah.  We're going to do Boston.  We're going to do Boston next year.  But I mean, for the first time.  Yeah.  Okay.  How was, uh, Abu Dhabi?  Awesome.  Awesome, man.  I'm telling you guys, I went to Abu Dhabi, um, at the beginning of this week.  I was there till, uh, Tuesday and you want to talk about a hip, uh, city, man.  I mean, it's just, it's the coolest city I've ever been to ever. 
[02:46:30]  And we're talking about doing an event there.  Just like we did UFC 100 with the, with the, uh, you know, the expo and all the things we  did.  We're going to do something like that in Abu Dhabi.  I got one question for you.  It's a two word question.  Russian whores.  Yes.  No, no comment.  Okay.  Let's move on.  Where is Abu Dhabi?  What are you crazy?  I was going to boss that.  It's a fucking Dana White.  Where's, where's Abu Dhabi?  It's, it's right in the middle of the Middle East, man. 
[02:47:00]  It's like right below Kuwait.  Iran is like right across the water from them.  They're like, it's the greatest place on earth surrounded by all the crazies, man.  But, uh.  Yeah, but you get to fly in on the Zufa jet.  I'll be on some fucking jumbo airliner with guys in the back bobbing, reading books.  Isn't it like facing east as the flight goes, scary motherfuckers, bringing tigers in  on cages, first class coach and then women, workers from India, all in jumpsuits and shit, 
[02:47:30]  shackled.  It's like Iraq's Catalina Island, isn't it?  It's just kind of sitting there off Iraq.  It's like, it's an incredibly wealthy nation.  Indiana Jones planes with the chickens.  So how big is UFC over there?  It's huge, man.  Listen, the guys, the guys who run Abu Dhabi.  Right below lion fighting.  These guys are frigging, uh, you know, they're young, hip, visionary.  Every, every, all the schools over there, um, I think 83 schools right now in the UAE all 
[02:48:00]  have to take mixed martial arts.  It's mandatory.  Wow.  It's mandatory.  You have to take it as part of school.  And by, uh, the end of, uh, 2011, every school in the UAE will have mandatory mixed martial  arts.  Wow.  How annoyed do you get, like with so many of these sportscasters that, I mean, they're  starting to understand that UFC is a legitimate sport, but so many of these fucking dummies  don't want to, they, they want to just talk about boxing, which is a great sport, but the 
[02:48:30]  way they, well, you know, UFC is it's slot.  It's not boxy.  It's like, it's fucking harder than boxing.  They're fools.  They're fools.  If you ever see, there's an interview that I did with me and Lou DiBella, who's a, a boxing,  uh, oh, here's a funny story.  I was on a plane, Dana, yesterday.  I was on a plane yesterday and some fucking guy and his wife are having this argument.  It was just a disaster.  Older guy and the wife's a fucking hatchet face and it's just a disaster.  And she's bitching at him.  He's like, and finally he goes, will you just shut up?  This is on a plane, right?  And I'm like, this poor fuck.  So I'm Twittering that this poor fuck and his wife are arguing. 
[02:49:00]  It's Bob Arum, the boxing promoter.  Get the fuck out.  Oh, wow.  Right in front of me, sitting right in front of me.  So I take a picture of him because I want to prove it to people.  This is Twitter.  We're on the tarmac before we take off.  I'm telling everybody, holy shit, it's actually Bob Arum.  So I'm Twittering the whole thing.  So I get a picture of him and me like a dummy.  I forgot to take my phone off silent.  So I get the phone, like put it right in the front.  And I take a picture of him.  He goes, it's like right in his fucking face.  Well, that'll get you thrown out of a strip club too, real quick.  Yes, real quick.  Men's locker room.  Yeah, that too, Jimmy. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  But back to Abu Dhabi, when you were talking about Abu Dhabi.  The Sheik over at Abu Dhabi is a huge fan of martial arts.  He's actually a black belt in jiu-jitsu.  And he used to host the biggest world submission championships in the world.  Still does.  Yeah.  Still does.  Well, they used to do it in Abu Dhabi.  But then they did it in Brazil.  And they did it in the United States.  I think the next one is either in New York.  Is it in New York?  Is it the next one?  Well, I think those are the trials.  They still do them in Abu Dhabi.  But the trials are all over the world now. 
[02:50:00]  They have the trials, and then the people who make it to the trials go do the Abu Dhabi.  Well, I went to the world championships.  He had Abu Dhabi in Brazil in 2003.  It's because after 2001, a lot of people didn't want to go to the United Arab Emirates.  Not really.  But he's been a huge fan and a huge sponsor from the very beginning.  He's one of the guys that, when there was no money in this sport, helped a lot of the big names keep going.  Because when they got into this Abu Dhabi tournament, they made damn good money.  He paid them very well to go.  But you used to be able to see, like, Tito Ortiz grappled Matt Hughes. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  You know, you used to see these cool grappling matches because of him.  Yeah.  And, well, he had Marcelo Garcia grapple Diego Sanchez.  And Jake Shields fought a bunch of real good guys.  And when he does this, he sets it up and has these guys come and stay with him in Abu Dhabi.  And he pays them, like, big money to train him.  He's fucking serious about it.  He's very talented, too.  He's really good as a grappler.  He's no joke.  Yeah.  True.  Rapplers. 
[02:51:00]  Well, Dana.  Those are frightening, man.  We're looking forward to tomorrow, man.  Fuck, yeah.  We can't fucking wait.  Finally, I'm glad you guys are coming.  You got 97 tickets.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  You're rubbing that in.  And I'm looking forward to seeing you guys.  You know, we gave you a little extra time today knowing that we asked for too many tickets.  Like he needs the time.  I'm just fucking around, man.  It's going to be an insane card.  Kenny Florian versus BJ Penn.  That's the main event for the lightweight title.  That's a sick matchup.  Kenny Florian, number one contender. 
[02:51:30]  BJ Penn, he's coming off the loss to GSP.  He's got to reestablish himself at lightweight.  That's a big, big fight.  And of course, Anderson Silva versus Forrest Griffin.  That's fucking huge.  You know, Anderson Silva, that's a big challenge.  He's taking on a giant light heavyweight.  A guy who legitimately is, you know, top five light heavyweights in the world.  Former champion.  And, you know, Anderson's stepping up big time.  It's a big fight.  I feel like I'm right next to him while he's announcing, man.  This is fucking great.  Why don't you sit next to me tomorrow?  You want to feel like...  Come sit right here.  We've got an empty chair.  I'll push Joe Silva over. 
[02:52:00]  Nice.  You can sit right next to me.  You want to feel like a non-man?  Go to the weigh-in.  When you see these fucking specimens without shirts...  Perfect shame.  ...and you're just like, I am a fucking lump of shit with teeth.  I'm not even a male.  I shouldn't have testicles.  I should just get a fucking...  I would like to see if it's play-by-play with Jim Norton and Joe Rogan.  Good point, Joe.  He sure does hit hard.  You could sit right next to Goldberg.  Just Goldberg, you, me, and then Opie and Anthony right here.  All of us together, K-side.  Let's fucking do this.  I'll have to check that out. 
[02:52:30]  Dude, it's an amazing fucking spectacle to see live.  It's the greatest sport in the history of the world by far.  And the craziest thing is, it's the oldest sport, and now it's the newest.  It's the weirdest thing ever.  It's the original sport.  Look, the origin of all sports is men trying to dominate other men.  That's the origin.  That's what it's all about.  Chimpanzee DNA.  That's what it's all about.  But it's like, for whatever reason, the sport of fighting has kind of been pushed back.  And we got involved with balls and fucking borderlines and flags and rules and points and all that nonsense. 
[02:53:00]  And now it's back to the original sport.  It's crazy that the most exciting, newest sport in the world is really the oldest sport in human history.  Yeah, pretty much amounts to a caveman bashing in another caveman's head.  But no, it's because it's so skillful.  It requires so much control over your emotions, so much discipline, so much intelligence, so much control over your ego because you have to objectively assess your own weaknesses and strengths in order to improve and to improve upon your weak areas. 
[02:53:30]  You can't be delusional and be a professional mixed martial arts fighter.  There's so much mental involved in it.  How much work and dedication goes into being great at what you do.  You have to be good at everything.  And you've got to – there's no drinking.  There's no fucking around, sleep until noon.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  There's at least two training sessions a day, five, six days a week, deep tissue massage when you're not doing it, chiropractic, get some sleep.  Yeah, full release if you're lucky.  Save your loads.  What Joe is getting at, and I agree, is when will the fighters be nude like in the old days? 
[02:54:00]  Like in those pancreasions?  Like when you see pottery, one guy's grabbing the other guy's dick and the other guy's grabbing his neck.  So where do you shop for pottery?  Exactly.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking eight.  Great town.  Yeah, that's a good out.  Dana, it's always a pleasure.  You know that.  We'll run into you tomorrow, obviously.  Thanks so much, Dana.  See you tomorrow, brother.  See you, man.  Dana White, everyone, from the UFC, of course. 
[02:54:30]  Going to continue with Joe.  He's the greatest boss in the history of the world.  He is the shit, man.  He really is.  He's a cool guy.  He shakes everybody's hands, too.  Yeah, he's a real deal.  He's a real regular guy that somehow or another is running a gigantic company.  But unlike your average regular guy, super dedicated, works 16 hours a day.  He's a fucking fanatic.  One of the reasons why it's successful, though.  Yeah, but outside of that, he's as normal as you get.  You hang out with him, no air, no bullshit.  You forget that.  He's that powerful. 
[02:55:00]  That part will go away.  He had a 40th birthday party last weekend.  We went to it in Vegas, and fucking Stone Temple Pilots played at his 40th birthday party.  It was surreal.  There was 100 people at this party.  It was all intimate friends.  And we're sitting there, and I introduced Stone Temple Pilots in a fucking conference  hall, conference room in Vegas.  So the small stage, and I'm telling you, they were fucking phenomenal.  It was the best live performance I've ever seen.  They put on like a full rock star show for 100 people.  Dude, that must have cost fucking 10, 12 grand to get to me. 
[02:55:30]  Maybe more than that, Joe.  You know something?  That's for Koli shit.  It sounds cool.  That's for Koli shit.  Yeah.  It sounds cool until you realize Chubby Checker played at Jimmy's birthday.  Yes, he did.  That's right, Joe.  And he sang happy birthday to me.  Yes, she did.  Scott Weiland sang happy birthday to Dana.  Let's see.  But maybe you didn't hear, Joe.  Chubby Checker?  Chubby Checker.  And he did the twist with Sabra Cadabra.  Oh, my God.  It was enough to make you indifferent.  All right, we're going to regroup. 
[02:56:00]  We've got Jim Jeffries down the hall.  We've got to get him in here.  Oh, cool.  And is Devin here?  Devin, who was in the Home Alone movies?  Devin Ritre.  He's a great guy.  Jim Jeffries.  I love that dude.  Yes.  Devin was the older brother in the Home Alone movies.  I used to like Jim.  And he's a friend of the show.  And Jim Jeffries is going to rape him.  Yes.  Right after this.  Jim's the Carolines, right?  They're going to do naked pottery poses.  No, Jim is not the Carolines.  Oh, he's not?  Okay.  No, I forgot his plugs.  He'll let us know.  I saw his picture.  That's an unnecessarily angry guy. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, and I'm not unnecessarily defensive.  What the fuck?  I saw a photo.  Two characters.  I love our characters.  Me too.  They all stink.  All right, this could be the most crowded we've ever been.  We've got Joe Rogan in studio.  Of course, Jim Norton.  We've got Jim Jeffries.  We've got Ari.  Ari's warming up for you.  Ari Shafir will be performing with me at Helium in Philly tonight.  Tonight, two shows.  Very good.  And Joe Curry dropped by my pal.  Where's Joe?  Behind Joe Rogan?  I can't see you, Joe. 
[02:57:00]  There's Joe Curry.  Yeah, he's at McGuire's.  McGuire's Comedy Club tonight on Long Island.  Very nice.  I did that place.  Yeah.  Back in the day.  We were off the air, but I had a really funny line.  I'm like, yeah, it's like Grand Central Station here.  The whole place cracked up.  What?  It was E-Roc.  I'm kidding.  I'm just bummed out that I missed Twato by a day.  I know.  One day, sure.  I was listening yesterday on the way to the airport, listening to you guys talking about  having E-Roc sniffer asshole, and I was listening, driving like this the whole time, 
[02:57:30]  with this face like, oh.  You picked Twato out of your fucking nose the other day.  What are you talking about?  Is it close?  I haven't even seen a picture of Twato.  You've never seen a picture of Twato?  Twato's disgusting.  No, no, no.  Oh, my God.  I would like to.  It's like an ear.  This is yesterday.  It looks like cauliflower.  Jesus Christ.  What'd you get, Twato?  No, I'm just showing him.  He's got a video of her pulling her pants down so he sniffs my ass.  Oh, my God.  Oh, it's obviously a wart.  Yeah, yeah.  Right?  Well, she refuses to admit that it's a genital wart. 
[02:58:00]  It looks like what you'd think a stegosaurus would look like.  Do you have the whole vagina with that thing?  Yeah, it's a wart.  It's big.  That should have a dime next to it for scale.  How long has she had it?  I can't believe he got in there like that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, E-Rock will do anything.  We should have E-Rock do something for Joe today.  E-Rock's a trooper, man.  E-Rock.  What can we have E-Rock do for Joe Rogan today?  I wonder if E-Rock will take some belly button.  I might have a little belly button.  I fucked last night.  Whatever happened to Pat Duffy, the kid that drank the baby bird? 
[02:58:30]  We couldn't keep him around anymore.  I don't know.  He wanted to work for free, and the company wouldn't let him work for free.  What the fuck?  That kid is the greatest trooper in the history of interns.  We love Pat Duffy.  Do you remember that day?  Yes.  Jesus Christ.  Yes, Joe is the one that actually brought it up.  I brought it up as a goof.  I thought, let's have him throw up in his mouth.  And Duffy's like, okay.  I'll do it.  He hangs his head off the fucking, the back of the garbage pail, so his-  Like you're in a salon getting your head down.  Yeah, like his super cuts, yeah.  When Pat from Munaki unloaded in his mouth, it was the fucking craziest thing I've ever 
[02:59:00]  seen in my life.  It didn't stop.  It was like one of those fucking porn movies where the jizz just keeps going.  I don't know.  This has to be two takes.  This has to be a fake take.  This is two takes.  Where's the cut?  Come on.  It's one of the greatest YouTube videos ever.  It really is.  It's unbelievable.  Didn't they pull it from YouTube?  That's the problem.  They pulled it from my YouTube account.  We were getting-  Baby Bird.  Baby Bird.  People complain.  Now there's a version up there, but we were getting insane hits and they pulled it.  Goddamn, that was awesome.  That was going through the roof.  I really honestly, no bullshit, I really honestly feel like I was a part of radio history. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, yeah.  That was the greatest day ever.  That was the greatest day ever.  We had so much fun.  I remember we were leaving the studio after it was over.  It had been gone for an hour.  It would have already been gone.  And we were still going, what the fuck?  I couldn't even imagine that it really happened.  It's like, did that happen?  And every five seconds you think about it, I go, what the fuck?  And you start laughing again.  That was one of the top five days we've ever done.  A wave, unbelievable.  A wave, a wave of puke.  I couldn't believe how much fucking eggnog he put down. 
[03:00:00]  When he kept going, I'm like, this is incredible.  And he had to go take a bottle and shot.  And Joe, they took the eggnog drinking contest away from us.  What the fuck is that?  Who's doing that?  That's Paulo, I think.  Paulo licking.  Licking Twotto.  Or licking Twotto.  Why is it yellow?  They dyed it.  They dyed it so you can see it?  She painted it that day.  Well, it has to be a ward.  That's how big it is.  She's a painter.  What else is that?  I mean, it looks like a ward.  It's got that texture.  It's got that scaly fucking...  It's fucking horrendous.  It's got that clover-feeled skin.  What does she say it is?  It looks like half a year.  What does she say it is? 
[03:00:30]  She says she cut herself shaved.  She goes, I cut myself shaved, man.  It just started growing after that.  That's the best part.  Man.  Man.  Give me $100, man.  Oh, my God.  I got to make a living, man.  It's a gigantic pussy wart.  Holy shit.  That is a giant fucking wart.  And someone licked that?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Who fucking...  How about that fucking Crip Keeper hand  that's pulling those panties outside?  That's awful.  What a goddamn nightmare.  You know what?  The sad part?  That's like seven years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  She was a virtue of a very vulnerable kind of kid back then. 
[03:01:00]  That was about seven years ago.  Where was E-Rock?  Was it really?  Yeah.  Where is E-Rock?  At least.  Because it was N.E.W.,  so at this point, it's at least seven.  Oh, my God.  Where's E-Rock?  We got to do something for Joe Rogan today.  Exactly.  By the way, the Monarch had a horrible shirt.  Jim Jeffrey's in the corner there.  Hey, Jim.  Hello.  I want to introduce you to everybody out there.  I don't even know.  I'm slightly hungover.  Hungover?  Hungover.  What were you drinking?  Just beer?  I'm not that exciting.  You can drink a lot of beer, though.  I don't do that thing that Americans do with Jager bombs  and the high-fiving and all that.  No. 
[03:01:30]  Just beer.  Just old-fashioned.  I could get a pretty good hangover going from just beer, though.  Oh, yeah.  You can get fucked up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not as fast.  I just...  That girl's wart is...  What's that mean?  It's fucking horrific.  But I used to get warts all the time on my cock  and get them frozen off, right?  No way.  Oh, yeah.  Still do.  What was wrong with...  There you go.  Still do.  Still do.  Still do.  What was wrong with your...  What's wrong with your dick that you get warts?  Once you get them, you got them for life.  It's not like it's herpes.  You just get the occasional wart.  How'd you get them?  You find out who gave them?  I don't know.  They can lay dormant for years before one comes up. 
[03:02:00]  I had one for about two months.  I'm on a good run at the moment.  But I remember...  You haven't had one for two months.  That's a good run?  Jesus Christ.  Two months.  I'd be painting a target in the back of my throat.  I was getting one frozen off.  Time to decorate the walls.  I can't go two months without a dick ward.  Boom!  Iraq, what can you do for Joe?  Well, I can't believe you sniffed her asshole. 
[03:02:30]  I mean, listening to it on the radio is one thing,  but seeing you actually, how close you got...  Yeah.  You're a fucking trupper, kid.  Will you take a little belly button?  I don't think it's nearly as bad as you got.  That's easy stuff.  But I still want to Iraq and take it.  I want to...  Yeah.  Okay.  Come here.  Whoa!  He's a trooper.  There's something homoerotic about that.  He is a trooper.  Just tell me if it's bad or not.  Okay.  What are you going to do?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  How are you doing this, Jimmy?  Hold on a second.  Let me get my iPhone ready.  I got some belly button in here.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I'm digging deep.  I gotta get this, too.  Yeah, this is ridiculous.  My nickname is the deep belly button kid. 
[03:03:00]  No, is it?  Yeah.  Dig deep.  Keep digging.  Come on, guys.  I can only get so much of this fucking beauty.  All right, let's go.  So what's going on, Jim?  You got what?  A little bit of belly button stuff.  Someone got laid last night.  Oh, and Iraq, what are you going to do?  Smell it.  Whoa!  You sniff it?  Is that real?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Just smell it?  Yeah.  No, just smell it?  Oh, my God.  He fell backwards.  That was real.  What is he pulling backwards?  You okay? 
[03:03:30]  You okay?  I've never been happier.  Hang on.  No, are you still going to lick it?  Iraq, Iraq, are you still going to lick it?  I got to lick it?  No, you're not licking my finger.  I thought you were going to lick it.  No.  I thought you were going to lick his belly button.  I don't think he got enough.  Yeah, one more time.  I thought he was going to.  One more time.  I'm confused.  I thought he was going to lick the belly button.  That's what I thought.  Here you go, Iraq.  I thought he was going to lick the belly button.  Anthony, didn't you think that's what was happening?  I thought that's what it was doing.  Okay, Iraq, here you go.  You're supposed to lick the belly button.  Since you hurt my feelings. 
[03:04:00]  What is that smell?  Is that just old loads?  Yeah, just a load from yesterday.  A load from yesterday.  He's getting emotional.  Oh, my God.  My goodness.  I didn't get it.  Your belly button stinks.  You want some?  No.  Why don't you be fucking part of the team?  Well, he's got old loads that he stored up in his belly button.  Not old loads.  And he just scratched it.  Is that bad?  This is what flaky G's.  So are you not going to drink it?  Or lick it, rather? 
[03:04:30]  Lick it?  Yeah, lick it.  I thought you were going to lick it.  You should be part of the team.  I'm going to vomit.  You won't vomit.  Everyone's taking some.  Ope's taking it.  Rogan took it once.  I took it.  Everyone's taking it.  I took it.  You can tell me.  Everyone's taking it.  All right.  Jim said yes.  All right.  I'll do it.  But what exactly am I taking?  You're just going to smell his loads.  My finger.  I can do this.  Smell his finger loads.  It's actually not as bad.  E-Rock's very sensitive.  He's smelling his belly button.  This won't affect Jeffrey's at all.  His belly button.  I could do that all day.  Wow.  What a fucking lot. 
[03:05:00]  Go ahead.  That's nothing.  It's like Vegemite.  Someone's not cocky at all.  I could do that all day.  Did you see him gag?  That was a great gag.  What happened a second time?  What happened?  What happened, Jim?  Actually, she got cocky.  His fucking belly button's undefeated.  His belly button's undefeated.  You have the broccoli in your belly button's undefeated. 
[03:05:30]  He was just puked.  People want to fucking get in a ring with the big boys.  That's what happened.  There's fucking loads in there from prom night.  Lesnar could take that.  That was a good one from last night.  I fucking shot a load.  You wipe a load out.  You don't shower.  It went into your belly button.  It certainly did.  And it ferments.  So this is just jerking off?  No, it was fucking.  But when I came, it was like you wipe it off until you shower.  Smell your belly button the next morning if you dump.  It's horrendous.  What were you fucking a dumpster? 
[03:06:00]  Jeffrey's, you okay?  Aren't they all antsy?  Look at him.  Look at his face.  He's not going to be the same again.  Yeah, I know.  I can't believe he puked.  You want one more whiff?  You said you could do it all day.  Do you want one more whiff?  I still want to see if E-Rock's willing to lick it.  Anyone who thinks that we fake these, like, spelling competitions on TV, that's radio.  I still want to see if E-Rock's willing to lick it.  I won't let him lick my finger.  You won't let him lick your finger?  I'm talking about lick your belly button.  It's worse off the finger.  There's something about the way you dollop on the finger.  It's dolloped.  Yeah, yeah.  How about it's concentrated?  It aerates it a little. 
[03:06:30]  No, no.  How about E-Rock gets a whiff of Jim Jeffries' puke?  Let's keep this going.  Where's E-Rock?  E-Rock.  Where's E-Rock?  E-Rock does rule.  Well, now E-Rock is going to take a sniff of Jim Jeffries' puke that's in the wastebasket.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Yesterday, Twato.  Come on, E-Rock.  Today, Jeffrey's puke.  For once.  E-Rock has never said no to us.  Just smell it.  He's never said no to us.  Jesus.  He's going to put his alcohol in the wastebasket.  It used to be that I would smell puke, like, before I hosted Fear Factor. 
[03:07:00]  I would smell puke, and I'd want to puke.  But now, let me see.  I haven't done Fear Factor in years.  Let me see if I still have.  Watch him get a rod.  Nothing.  That's all right.  You're a veteran.  You're a veteran.  I used to get sick, though.  I used to smell people's...  You're a veteran.  Like, you'd go to the bathroom at a bar, and you'd smell someone throw, and you'd start  heaving.  Now, it's nothing.  It's gone.  It went away.  Please, Eric.  Joseph did it.  I did it, and I had no surgery a month ago.  That's right.  Fresh and clean.  Get right up there.  Right up there.  Get in there, E-Rock. 
[03:07:30]  Get in there, E-Rock.  For once.  Do something for the show.  I got my face right in the basket.  Stop taking.  Jim Jeffries' puke that's in the wastebasket.  I know what you do is take.  There he goes.  How about just get in there and smell it?  Get in there.  Will you get in there?  Get in there.  Smell the fucking stomach bio of an Australian alcoholic.  Look, Joe Rogan's doing it.  Come on.  At least it's a fucking great comics puke.  Come on, E-Rock.  He's not a middle.  Come on, E-Rock.  He's getting that headlining moment, then.  He's having HPO special.  Get in there.  He's down. 
[03:08:00]  Come on, E-Rock.  He's all red.  This is the thing is he can't even vomit into the bin because he just smells it more.  E-Rock, what's the problem?  Oh, God.  It's going to smell out of his nose.  We'll just shut out your nose, E-Rock.  Does it smell bad?  His dignity.  I didn't think he had any left.  Get one more in there.  You all right, buddy?  Yeah, one more.  It looks worse than it smells.  One more fear factor sniff. 
[03:08:30]  Just get in there.  Get your head in there.  Get your head in there.  Get in there.  Uh-oh.  I just want to know what's in it.  I don't want to know what he ate.  He's trying to remember what he ate last night.  Ew.  Oh, these pills didn't digest.  Ew.  There's nothing worse than when you see a full Cialis and you puke.  Oh, for Pete's sake.  God damn it.  I wonder if I can reuse it.  I don't remember that.  Another night of excuses.  I know what happened.  I went to McDonald's and I asked for a 20-piece of nuggets. 
[03:09:00]  Right?  20?  Yeah.  They sell 20s in this country?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  I said a 20-pack of nuggets and the lady gave me 24-packs of nuggets.  24-packs?  Yeah.  So I had...  24, 80.  And I was wasted.  80 nuggets.  Yeah.  And I ate like 40 of them.  Jesus.  So that's why you threw up?  That's not the reason.  Nothing to do with sniffing his dirty load.  That's not the reason I threw up.  I think that's a goddamn excuse.  You sniffed his rancid load off of his finger.  Right.  Sounds like a bunch of bunk.  I didn't overeat them. 
[03:09:30]  Goddamn excuse.  How do you start puking that doesn't bother you?  I don't know.  It doesn't bother me anymore.  You want a little double B?  It's up to you.  What, that?  Yeah.  I'll sniff it.  It's actually...  You're getting the easy one because I've already gone through two already.  This is thirds.  Yeah, this is thirds.  This is Joe Rogan taking a sniff.  Wow.  Jimmy's boat.  Joe's like, wow.  That's strong.  Let me tell you something.  That's stronger than the puke.  Yeah, really?  That's a rancid fucking stench.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Holy shit.  That can't be good.  That's nature warning you to get the fuck away from that.  That's what that is.  Yes.  It's like that stinky pussy smell. 
[03:10:00]  The stinky pussy smell is probably worse.  It's worse than shit, really.  Yeah, yeah.  There's something about it that's like it makes you shake.  Because you're smelling something that you're not supposed to smell in another person.  You're not supposed to eat it.  Does it smell like that if it's like a normal day?  Get in there, bitch.  Get in there.  Get in there.  It has no scent.  It doesn't smell.  All right, have a go at it.  Get in there, Shafir.  Everyone else is going to go.  I use when it stinks.  Come on.  After I shoot a load, if it goes on me and I don't shower.  Once I shower, it's gone.  But if I sleep the night and it's just like a little bit of load.  Stews. 
[03:10:30]  It's a good word.  It's stews.  It takes something.  Get in there, Shafir.  Be part of the team.  It's real.  It's horrible.  Did it touch you?  Did it touch your nose?  He touched it.  I didn't touch it.  Oh, he touched his nose.  I'm having memories of the bathroom.  Get some Purell.  I'm having memories of it.  Yeah, it's a weird smell.  Welcome to YouTube, folks.  Anybody else want to...  Hey, we got Devin here.  Do you want to come in and take some?  Let's see if Devin would trade with us.  Oh, he's depressed today, man.  John Hughes died.  Oh, he said, all right. 
[03:11:00]  Devin.  It's Devin.  Jesus.  What's up, Devin?  It's been way too long.  Way, way, way too long.  You know everybody in the room?  Oh, you just shook his hand right after he's been digging in his...  No, no, no.  I always pick the left pointer finger.  You're a good man.  I wouldn't change my fingers.  What did I miss?  I've been...  I've been...  They've been smelling...  Fucking E-Rock begged to smell my belly button, so I let him, and Jim wanted some, and he  wanted...  I just let everybody smell my belly button.  Let me take the record.  I didn't want some.  It's like I never left.  I did it.  I never begged to do it. 
[03:11:30]  I got told to do it and did it.  You know, I was told that...  Steve told me that things have really changed, and the level of the show is really...  The caliber is really increased.  I walk in, I see a guy puking.  I'm like, what happened?  What happened?  Like, oh, they're just smelling Jim Norton's belly button.  Yeah, yeah.  Same shit.  Glad to know things are...  Nothing has changed.  One thing you'll notice is there's not one vagina in the room.  Yes, not at all.  Which is awesome.  That's the biggest difference.  Awesome.  Yeah.  He used to have a lot of...  A lot more vagina.  Yeah.  And breath. 
[03:12:00]  Did anybody ever come to you guys and try to get you guys, at any point in time during  your career, try to get a chick to sit in with you guys?  Like, you guys are too male.  Oh, yeah.  Give me some stories.  Everybody hears that.  Every, like, two years, they try that tech.  Yeah.  Who would they try to get you to happily laugh in their face?  And they usually approach it like, we understand the type of girl you don't want on the show,  but there should be a girl's presence that would kind of, you know, get the female demo  in a little more.  That's like, you mean a hole.  You mean the fucking hole.  The one that goes, guys, now... 
[03:12:30]  Oh, my God.  Stop it.  Stop it.  That isn't what...  Now, don't be mean like that.  Ugh.  Enough.  Oh, there's...  See, there's Wendy Williams on TV.  It's like asking a guy to sit in on Oprah.  Like, Oprah, you need a man.  You need a man next to you.  A manly man.  Call you a fat cunt every so often.  You know?  Yeah, that's what I need.  First day on the show in 2002, I remember somebody from Survivor.  One of the chicks from Survivor came in, and she was sillily hot.  Was that Kim? 
[03:13:00]  Kimmy?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, that's who it was.  It was Kimmy.  I watched her change in the bathroom.  She's a big, fat pussy.  I remember she was really sexy.  She showed you her pussy?  She got naked.  It was very sexy.  Why did she do that?  She's a good person.  We miss her.  Why wouldn't she, Joe?  I'm sure she's asked herself that question many times.  If I recall Monsterian, Jim, you like a nice roast beefy, huge lady.  Yeah, I do.  I like big pussy lips, too.  Do you really?  I'm a fan, yeah.  I don't like it.  I like when girls go, oh, I don't like it.  It sticks out.  Fuck you.  I like it.  Shut up.  I want nothing. 
[03:13:30]  I just want a straight line.  No way.  I like it when you're fucking them, when you're pulling your dick out, the pussy lips are  like grabbing your dick.  No, no, no.  Come back.  No, no, no.  Come back.  She looked like we have a mouth of a gooey duck clam.  A fucking cunt that you smoked like the exploding cigar.  Like a fucking Debbie Duckface cunt.  My first girlfriend in high school had pussy lips like that.  I love this.  Retractable, like you were fucking a balloon or something like that.  They're really fat and meaty.  I love when they're fat and there's like a fucking explosion. 
[03:14:00]  It feels better.  Oh, it's wonderful.  Yeah.  It's like an extra pussy.  Good smell to it.  Extra pussy.  The more pussy, the better.  It's right.  Like there's thicker, there's more meat in it.  Why is Jeffrey's disgusted by this?  Would you just like a nice clear line?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck that.  I don't like anything.  A communist?  Yeah, exactly.  Fat pussy lips.  I don't like anything that, like those pussy lips that are really violent looking like  they're out of the bottom of a deep fryer.  It looks like a galamat.  You want a fucking Japanese eye.  I hate that. 
[03:14:30]  I like any girl who had to change.  Any girl who had to change with her cunt in a locker because she was too embarrassed.  Like the other girls would poke fun at her.  Of course they would.  And call her like fucking names.  That's the type of girl I want.  There was one porn star.  I'm trying to remember her name.  She actually got it fixed.  Oh, boo.  But she used to have a big, giant pussy lips.  Boo, shame on her.  That should be her name.  Oh, Houston.  That was her name.  Remember Houston?  Oh, the gangbang chick?  Yeah, she was one of the first gangbang chicks.  She had a giant pussy lips. 
[03:15:00]  They were like hands.  Like hands on the outside of her pussy.  Not even like normal hands.  Like Brock Lesnar hands.  I don't mind to fuck the big pussy lips.  But if I go down on it, I got like skin in my mouth.  Oh, I suck on those fucking things.  The big flap.  I suck on them.  I suck on them.  Suck it.  Suck it.  You like diet pussy.  Yeah, yeah.  You really do?  I like a fucking, I like it just to be horrific.  I really do.  I like that smell.  I like fucking big dogs.  No, no one likes the smell.  No, no, no.  Like a just smell. 
[03:15:30]  A smell like pussy.  I don't mind like pussy smell when a girl gets back from the gym.  Where are you going?  Marion Barry.  Oh, nice.  Is that Marion Barry's here?  Bring him in.  Oh, hilarious.  Get him in here, Jimmy.  Get him in here.  Marion Barry.  He's a judge.  Former governor of Washington, D.C.  Got busted smoking crack.  Came back and won again.  Right, didn't he?  He'll be the mayor.  He did.  Become the mayor again?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  One of the biggest comebacks ever.  Yeah.  Got caught smoking crack.  And the best thing was when they were interviewing people, like in D.C., go, everybody smoke  a little crack now and then. 
[03:16:00]  Who don't smoke a little crack?  Everybody smoke a little crack.  And most of the population agreed with that.  They had all these people like, what do you think about Marion Barry coming back into  office?  All right, man.  What's the big deal?  Most of the population agreed.  They're like, sure.  We do.  Why not?  Why not a little?  Yeah, that'd be nice to get him in here a couple of minutes.  There's a bunch of dudes next door that are cock blocking.  See this gentleman right here?  He's shaking his head no.  There he is.  Mr. Marion Barry.  Mr. Marion Barry.  Give him a microphone.  Give him a microphone right now.  Give him a mic.  Hello, sir. 
[03:16:30]  We'll be nice.  We'll be nice.  We just wanted to say hi to Marion Barry.  How many are you in here?  One, two, three, four.  Yeah, we got a lot of people in here today.  You're going to gang up on me, man.  No, no, no, no, no.  We were totally respectful.  No gang up.  No, sir.  Thank you.  We're actually a story, an inspirational story to a lot of people because things went  bad at one point and then all of a sudden you came back and you got redemption.  It's a pretty inspirational story.  That's why this movie is so important because most of the media outside of Washington, D.C.,  most of the people outside of Washington, D.C. only know me through 15-second news clips 
[03:17:00]  or 30-second news clips or some negative article in the newspaper.  They don't know about my 50 years of service and 35 years of political life in Washington  and being very successful, helping a lot of people.  So that's why that's important.  I was walking by and I heard you all say something about being popped for smoking crack.  Put that in context.  The FBI spent $25 to $40 million trying to entrap me.  They couldn't find anything financial on me because I don't dip into the till. 
[03:17:30]  They used that situation, set it up, and we don't know what was in that pipe because the  jury didn't convict me of anything at the Vista.  And so that crack story started with that, but there's been no evidence that we don't  know what was in it.  I mean, I was up there for some other reason, quite frankly.  What did you think was in it when you were smoking it?  I didn't smoke it.  Oh, okay.  I took one drag on it.  Oh, okay.  Do you feel that they were trying to railroad you because they didn't like politically  what you were doing?  They didn't like me economically and giving money to African-Americans and, you know, 
[03:18:00]  qualified contractors and putting parts about this size.  And we take it 47% of it, which I got to, and they don't like the money to be taken.  It is pretty amazing that they can do that, that they can go after you like that and spend  so much money to try to prosecute you.  Well, I'm used to it.  They're pulling you out.  They're pulling you out.  We are being married.  But what are you promoting?  We got a huge audience.  What are you promoting?  Phil?  HBO on Monday, 9 p.m., Nine Lives with Marion Barry. 
[03:18:30]  Nice.  Everybody ought to watch it and learn about the real Marion Barry, not what they read  in the press.  All right.  Well, thank you, sir.  Thank you, Marion.  What's the name of this show?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  How many of you are the Opie?  That's Opie.  There's one Anthony.  That's Anthony.  And a room full of our friends.  And I'm basically the driving force of the show, Jim Norton.  Don't step in.  We love you.  We love you.  Thank you very much.  Marion, if you need anything, talk to Joe.  Yeah, Joe might be carrying something.  It was amazing how many people were cock-balking there.  Well, they were worried that we were going to, like, I guess he had another 
[03:19:00]  They thought we were going to take the piss.  They were guys grabbing him, trying to pull him out.  By the way, he heard you, Joe.  Yeah, Joe.  He's like, nobody knows what's in that pipe.  What did you take?  What's in the fucking pipe?  That's just it.  It's like, come on, man.  Let's keep going.  Here's why they were pulling him out.  I didn't smoke it.  I liked how you were.  I didn't smoke it.  I just took a drag of it.  I took a drag.  I like that.  I like that thinking.  Jim is going back.  Jim.  Oh, shit. 
[03:19:30]  What happened?  Yeah, why is the monitor on that?  I've said 50 times to turn that off because we had an issue, and every day I go out there  and it's on.  And I asked for it to be turned off 20 fucking minutes ago, and now it was back on.  So he walks by, and you're not even shitting on him.  You're talking about something in context.  But that's what they hear.  So what happens is we lose the fucking more time with the guy because they hear a moment.  Well, also, let's be honest.  You guys have a bit of a reputation as troublemakers.  What is that about?  If you were a politician that got busted smoking crack, would you, you know, if you were the  handlers, would you let... 
[03:20:00]  I'm amazed we got him in the door.  He got right in.  And how calm and smooth, under fire was he?  Nobody knows what was in that pipe.  Did you?  I liked what you're thinking.  Did you know?  You know how he got in there?  I'm also pretty sure, though.  I will take fucking full credit for that.  And I'm like, Mr. Marion, I said, biggest audience on this platform right now is in  this room.  That's the biggest audience you're going to get.  Dan, you heard that, right?  Also, pretty sure, though.  We're going to get in trouble for having Marion Barry on the show.  Why would you get in trouble?  For what?  Because they have a weird policy.  We can't, like, grab other people's guests.  Can't just grab guests when they're walking by.  Oh, what the fuck? 
[03:20:30]  How stupid is that?  I saw the mayor of D.C. and I asked him if he wanted to come on.  I don't know what he's doing.  And you know what?  He handled himself admirably.  And other shows can grab our guests.  We don't give a shit.  If someone's walking by, how do we not try to get him out of the show?  I said he outsmarted the FBI and got re-elected after that scandal.  It's pretty amazing how much money they spent.  You think Opie and Anthony and Jimmy are going to throw him?  The guy walked in here all smooth and shit.  No problem.  Nobody knows what it is in that pipe.  They're not going to throw him.  He was a cool cat.  He's finally going to crack the FBI.  Get that sound clip and use it ad nauseum. 
[03:21:00]  Nobody knows what was in that pipe.  In that pipe?  Just nobody knows what was in that pipe.  I didn't smoke it.  I just took a drink.  I took a drink.  I didn't smoke it.  I took a drink.  I actually am surprised.  That was awesome.  Just that alone was worth having a room for.  He was the coolest guy ever.  I've never heard of the bloke and I love him.  I'm surprised.  I invited him in and then I came back in.  I didn't think he was going to come in.  And then a minute later they opened the door and he walked in.  There's something awesome about black politicians that get busted doing scandalous shit and then  come back.  You know what was great?  When he came in, the lady who was trying to drag him away, she just looked in the bin at 
[03:21:30]  my vomit at one stage and just shook her head.  Clearly he was a big fan of the show.  I think that's why he came in.  Yeah, that's what it is.  How many of you are the obese?  If he wasn't before.  How many are the Anthony's?  Yeah, how many of y'all are obese?  How many of you are obese?  We treated him very nicely.  Nobody fucked him.  Yeah.  He was checking the clock to see if the 12 was a big black hole in the camera.  I almost didn't ask him what he thought was in that pipe, but I had to.  You had to.  That's not a bad question.  I was actually going to jump on that when he stopped talking and you, thank God, took 
[03:22:00]  the rings.  I saw that guy pulling on him.  I'm like, you can't get away.  And I knew as a politician, if you ask him, he has to say something.  And he brought up the crack thing.  He said, I heard somebody talking about the crack.  Nobody knows who's in that pipe.  All they saw was me swung in a pipe.  Nobody knows who's in that pipe.  How much do you love Mary and Mary now?  Love him.  I didn't take a drag.  I took a puff.  I want to get him high on DMT now.  Would anyone have brought up the crack if he didn't bring it up? 
[03:22:30]  Yes, of course.  You have to because you have to say, well, what do you think?  I started with, and again, not all about me, but about you fell and then you ever, it's  like, well, we all know what he fell from.  Well, he brought it up because we were talking about it and he heard it in the monitor in the  hallway and he just came in to defend himself.  He couldn't help it.  He's kind of like the Muhammad Ali of black politics.  You know, they framed him.  They spent all this money framing him, getting him out of politics, but he came back.  The champ.  He really did come back.  It's amazing.  He got reelected.  It's not amazing. 
[03:23:00]  Look at his constituents.  And back to my new crack now, man.  I understand that.  How long ago was this?  How long ago was this guy reelected?  He seemed like a fairly old man.  He's not the mayor now, is he?  No.  When I was 16.  Yeah.  Well, that helps.  Nobody knows how old you are.  Exactly.  No one knows who you are.  Shut up, Ari.  39 right now.  We know your name.  Shut up, Ari.  Oh, really?  April of that year?  How old are you?  It doesn't help at all.  I didn't have a mic, and I realized that. 
[03:23:30]  Isn't there a recent Mary and Barry story?  Wasn't he in a park recently?  Yeah.  What the fuck was he doing?  Stalking a woman or something?  We didn't have enough time, though.  The Apollo doesn't get people off stage as aggressively as they were trying to get him out.  Holy shit.  Did you hear that little siren go off?  The guy in a white suit was going to come on any minute.  That was like an extrication from a car wreck or something.  What they didn't see at home was we were having a tug of war with Mary and Barry.  We were trying to keep him in there.  His handlers right away were pulling him away. 
[03:24:00]  But we didn't fuck with him at all.  It's like, what are they going to say?  We asked him a couple legit questions.  He has a bigger audience here.  Look, I'm sure Shade is a great audience, but this is the biggest audience he's going  to get on this platform.  I heard about Shade that the hype is real.  Yes, yes, the hype is real.  That's what I hear.  He looked like a guy in a zombie movie that gets too close to the window and all the arms  come in and pull him out.  They fucking grabbed him.  Barry.  They grabbed him.  You must eat Barry.  His handlers brought up the jaws of life. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He gets the door open with the jaws of life.  And you see the discussion outside the office, Jesus.  Yeah.  Outside the studio?  Not good.  I don't do it.  They get mad when we do that, but we can't help ourselves.  The mayor of D.C. is outside our door.  We try to get the best radio possible every fucking day.  Blame me, man.  Yeah, Rogan.  I invited the guy.  No, I invited him, and then I came back in studio.  When the later he came in, nobody's...  You heard it.  Jim Norton invited him.  Nobody fucking...  But nobody grabbed him and threw a mic in his face.  I was outside.  I said, Mr. Man, we're the biggest audience you're going to get today.  Do you want to come in? 
[03:25:00]  And I didn't think he was going to come because the woman goes...  And the woman he was with starts whispering to him.  So I'm like, oh, okay.  She's going to tell him no.  So I got my picture.  And then a fucking minute later, he walks on the door.  The fact is, if Rogan didn't mention crack, he never would have came in.  Yeah, I think...  That's what got him in.  He was defending himself.  You know what?  That's what Joe Rogan is going to thank.  Maybe not.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  That's what I'm here for.  So whenever he walks by, I just bitch about him.  I'm here to sniff Jim Jeffries' throw up.  I'm here to sniff his loads.  I should have asked if Mary Barry wanted some.  Oh, good Lord. 
[03:25:30]  By the way...  No one knows what's in Jim Norton's better body.  How great is this show, though?  We go from sniffing what fucking Norton had in his belly button to Mary...  Mary and Barry.  Within five minutes.  You know what was really great, though?  How shitty does Devin feel that Kenny came running in and just...  We need the mic!  And grabbed it away from your face so quickly.  It was...  Look, it had to be done.  You know?  I've been bumped before.  And Devin is hurting today.  He's hurting.  It's like microphone triage, though.  He had to look around and go, who's not contributing anything? 
[03:26:00]  I walk in and I'm like, hey, guys, great.  Nice to be here.  Nice coffee.  And nothing.  Hey, guys, take him with some morphine and take his mic.  And we wonder why Devin hasn't been around in a while.  Oh, no.  No respect.  Next time we're going to play some softball, right?  He looks like a guy who drives a truck and worships Elvis.  Don't most of them already?  Isn't that like the combo that they already have?  Those are some badass fucking sunglasses, son.  I appreciate that.  Where'd you get those, sir?  I got these.  Actually, my brother brought them back from Graceland for me.  Oh, they are great. 
[03:26:30]  They are Graceland.  Can you buy them online anywhere?  I'm sure you can buy them online.  I need a pair of those.  No, you can.  You can get them on the Elvis webpage.  I bought some before.  Really?  But these are hand-delivered, so I wear them with a pair.  I'm going to handle this a little delicately.  Do you mind if I tell these gentlemen about a certain relative of yours?  Oh, that's why he stopped doing it on our show?  A relative of mine?  Well, yes.  What?  What's going on?  You know, a man that was in a certain movie.  Oh, fuck.  That's why he stopped doing our show. 
[03:27:00]  Is it?  Dude, that was, yeah.  Gary Glitter.  What part of my dad was in an X-rated film do you not want me to say?  No, but it wasn't that bad.  His father, the guy that starred in the original Lady Chatterley's Lover.  Young Lady Chatterley.  Young Lady Chatterley, yeah.  The original.  Yeah.  70s fucking, you know.  His father is Sylvia Christelle.  Amazing.  Obscure reference.  Number 14. 
[03:27:30]  Just had to kind of.  Yeah, that's how I, it's probably how I got started in this business.  In this business.  Now I ended up on opening Anthony.  Now with the sunglasses, you could produce one of those movies.  Tell you the truth.  You look good.  I could make you a star.  Yeah.  Just come on over here.  Just give a little reading.  Now, of course, you're probably in mourning today.  It was not, yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's not easy.  Steve Seed assured me that there was going to be total respect.  I don't eat anything, water, food, a blowjob. 
[03:28:00]  What's he mourning for?  He knew John Hughes.  I worked with John Hughes.  Oh, okay.  John Hughes was definitely, I mean, I just wanted to say he was one of the nicest guys in the  business.  Yeah.  He changed my life forever.  He changed, I mean, he launched countless people's careers.  I made so many good movies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, who's going to forget Baby's Day Out?  There's a few duds, but fucking planes, trains, and automobiles.  Planes, trains, and automobiles, man.  Great film. 
[03:28:30]  No one saw Home Alone.  One of the best comedies ever.  You know what's fucked up?  Like, the last time you were on, there was no YouTube.  We could not possibly, at that time, punch up your part from Home Alone and look at it.  But now, we can.  Now you can see me as a 13-year-old boy.  Exactly.  I remember when you was that age.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You liked me.  Yeah, you liked to be kissed.  Happy birthday, Uncle Paul.  You were the older brother, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah.  Now you know.  Now you know.  Look at Joe's.  Yeah, look at Joe's.  There he is.  Look at that. 
[03:29:00]  We're just doing that on our show.  It's like Jim Jefferies.  I just smelled Norton's belly button there.  Yeah, there it is.  See, it all comes together.  Jizzed all over the airplane tickets.  Oh, no.  Oh, you.  Do you still hang out with Macaulay Culkin?  Do you know that kid?  No.  The last time I saw him was at a birthday party for him.  We have not really stuck in touch.  What birthday was it, though?  It was his 18th birthday.  It was a while ago. 
[03:29:30]  It was his 18th birthday.  Was he keeping it together?  What's going on with him?  God, I mean, he's had a rough year, this guy.  His sister dies earlier this year.  She got hit by a car.  Oh, Jesus.  Ooh.  And then Michael Jackson goes, who he was very close with.  Was he really?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was.  Did you ever meet Michael?  Were you too old at that point?  I don't like him.  He doesn't wear tight enough slacks.  Stop it.  Michael called him Devin the Cockblogger.  He came onto the set, actually, of Home Alone 2. 
[03:30:00]  The whole set?  Oh, I bet he did.  How fucking bold of him.  Did he touch it in a moonwalk?  That guy doesn't give a fuck.  He's worth a billion dollars.  He whips out that spotted dick and says, let's get this part started.  Looks like someone's tongue in a small leopard tail.  Somebody made a dick out of a cow's back.  Oh, my.  He was a very nice man.  Oh, Michael Jackson?  Yes.  He was a very cool guy.  That's how you get him in. 
[03:30:30]  You gotta be nice.  You can't be a douchebag.  You can't be a child molester.  No one scolding.  You're never gonna get repeat customers.  No one scolds a boy into the van.  You wanna get repeat customers, you gotta have a fucking, you gotta have an amusement park.  You gotta be a nice guy.  You gotta have wine.  There's a lot of the Jesus shoes, as he called it.  Nobody else.  You don't threaten a boy to get into the van with punishment.  You bring candy to wipe his memories clean.  He had Charleston shoes, and I enjoyed them.  He was a very polite, sweet guy, and he actually allowed me to videotape him. 
[03:31:00]  I filmed him in Macaulay.  Actually, I interviewed him and Macaulay.  Michael.  Michael Jackson and Macaulay Culkin together in the Home Alone house.  I was able to videotape them.  I do.  I have them.  The director was like, afterwards, he was like, wow, you know, you could sell that tape.  You'd never work in the business again, but you could sell it.  And I've been holding on to it.  Did you sell it?  No.  No?  What are you implying?  I'm sorry.  I don't understand. 
[03:31:30]  That's very funny.  So you still have that.  Was there anything revealing, or was it just a fun, like, oh?  Well, it's more of a tribute to him as a nice guy.  I mean, he was talking about where he first met Macaulay at the Nutcracker, when he went  to see the Nutcracker when he was six.  Yeah, Macaulay was-  I'm gonna leave that one alone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's too easy.  That's so easy.  Too easy.  It's too easy for Rogan.  Come on.  Nutcracker, what?  Oh, nothing.  Oh, guys, let's not.  Oh, Jimmy.  Too soon.  Has Devin smelled your finger? 
[03:32:00]  Too soon.  Devin was-  Do you want it?  No, I'm good.  I'm actually good.  You should smell it.  It's quite shocking.  I just smelled a rancid belly button before I got here.  I'm all full.  I'm upset.  I gotta drive tonight, really.  I can't.  I can't.  I'm good.  Seriously, just talking about that makes me want to vomit again.  You want to know where it's left?  I'll take one more whiff of the team.  I wonder what Michael Jackson's belly button smelled like.  Can't possibly be the fucking keg of beer you drank last night.  With the other McNuggets.  40 fucking McNuggets. 
[03:32:30]  I can't smell fucking cotton candy.  It's gonna make me feel-  McNuggets, they're really cadaver toast.  Every time you do an impersonation to me, it's Keith Richards.  Yeah!  Yeah, but we don't know.  The Australian accent's tricky.  You gotta be a good accent person.  Isn't Mr. Jeffries from Australia?  You always try to slip in an English accent, but-  He's doing fucking Captain Sparrow over here.  It's a little-  No.  That's it.  That's it.  No, Captain Sparrow is-  You gotta get to kick Jeffries.  He's gotta be like this.  Yeah!  He's an alcoholic. 
[03:33:00]  Because he has the ism.  The ism.  The ism.  The ism.  I don't think it has to do with smelling the button.  I mean, isn't that just a regular Tuesday morning for me sometimes?  Just puking.  Do you want some?  Listen, you don't understand what you're talking about.  You haven't smelled it.  Yeah, that's true.  You're not part of the team.  Unless you get in there, you're just talking shit.  Just about all of us have smelled it there.  You're just armchair quarterbacking, fella.  I heard that it's stewed like a Merlot.  Just get in there, man.  Get in there.  I won't talk to you again.  I'll show you.  I've already- 
[03:33:30]  I've already worked with Norton.  I've done a film with him.  Well, it's because you don't have a moat in there.  Yeah, I probably did.  He dumped a load in there.  Maybe your loads just don't carry that kind of fermentation capacity.  Oh, my God.  You're sitting there smelling it.  Oh, God.  Jimmy loves smelling it.  Why don't you have a sniff?  You're just sitting there smelling it.  No, wouldn't you enjoy it?  Wouldn't you enjoy it?  You can smell your own.  I don't know, man.  I don't know, man.  Get in there.  Get a sniff.  Jimmy, did the load crawl in there like the little tracking device in the Matrix?  What the fuck?  Like, how much load could you find? 
[03:34:00]  I wiped it out, but it just sweats and ferments it.  And I guess at night I dream scary things and I slam it shut.  I don't know what happens.  James scary things.  Close the belly button.  Fold it over.  Does your belly sweat at night?  Fold it over like a fucking burrito.  Keep it in there.  Is it flaky?  You tell me.  Give me a look at it.  Well, it stays moist.  It's not flaky.  Not at all.  Oh, my God.  If it was flaky, it probably wouldn't retain the smell.  When I leave jizz, I get flakes.  Yeah, but I wipe it off.  But not in the belly button. 
[03:34:30]  When it gets in there, it's like a little, like if you take like a saran wrap and you wrap it up and it stays moist.  That's what's going on.  He's got like a Tupperware belly button.  Just keep some, Ant?  No.  You gotta take some.  No.  For the team.  No.  No.  What's the big deal?  I don't do it.  Opie's taking some.  I don't think I do.  It's just the same.  You're the only one, Ant.  That's great.  I don't think I've ever smelled anything as rancid as that.  Oh, stop trying to suck up now.  That's silly.  You've never smelled pussy that smelled worse than that?  Yeah.  That was as bad as shit.  My girlfriend in high school.  There's one girlfriend in high school that back when they didn't understand, she went to Catholic school and no one taught her shit about personal hygiene. 
[03:35:00]  She was so hot.  But she had the stinkiest pussy ever.  It was devastating how bad it was.  Who needs to be told about personal hygiene?  Nobody's talking to you.  You're a Catholic school girl.  Nobody's telling you shit.  I know when my bullsecks stink.  No, they're all hiding from reality.  Everybody shuts the door.  Shut up.  I think they just watch the outside sometimes.  Like, the girls don't do the internal hygiene sometimes.  This girl must have had a yeast infection for two years.  It was a disaster.  She was so hot. 
[03:35:30]  I've seen a few of those.  It's the ones where you fuck them, and then the next morning when you're pissing, the smell wops up.  Wops up straight up.  And literally, you get lightheaded.  It's like, wow.  I remember that.  What could it be when you're fucking?  You ever get that white milky stuff on your dick?  Oh, when you're fucking a girl?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's just a pussy lube.  That's not yeast infection?  No.  Joe goes, oh, when you're fucking a girl?  Not like a dude.  But if it's a dude, it might be like...  It's the cum from the last guy.  It might be marrow.  You might be breaking bones. 
[03:36:00]  I know exactly what he's talking about.  That's subcutaneous fat.  Yeah.  You're ripping skin tissue.  You need to back off.  You're hitting it too hard.  Did you ever just get that milky stuff on the end, though?  That's just pussy.  It dries.  It's secretion.  It dries white.  You've actually met a girl that drips.  I would come home from school, and I would wear black jeans.  And when I would come home from school after fucking a girl in the sub-cellar of the high school,  it would look like I jizzed on my own pants.  I've been in the sub-cellar of the high school. 
[03:36:30]  I've been in the sub-cellar of the high school.  Casual.  Don't tie her up and leave her for dead.  Cost of his teaching job.  No, this is just last week I'm talking about.  You ever date a girl that gets so wet that they drip, that it drips down their legs?  No.  Another girl that I dated in high school was so wet.  She would get so wet that her inner thighs literally would be like she was crying.  There's nothing better than grabbing around to the lower back and feeling like the wet  dripped all the way down the back of her spine.  I've never been with a chick where I didn't have to spit in her pussy. 
[03:37:00]  It's part of the fun.  Oh, it's awful.  It's never wet.  God damn.  The one thing my parents said was, hey, keep it classy, Dev.  Yeah, keep it classy.  My dad, the wet pussy's for you.  This is classy.  This is a classy conversation.  It's just being real.  We're making you forget about the fact that you're in mourning today.  You know what I picked up that Joe said is the fact that she must have had a yeast infection  for two years. 
[03:37:30]  You fucked her for two fucking years.  I don't care.  I'd fuck her today if I could get away with it.  It's like, oh, her pussy stank so bad.  Two years it stank.  She was hot enough.  She was hot enough.  I was 16.  Yeah, of course.  You're so good.  I'm sticking it in there.  I don't give a fuck.  And are you in the age bracket when you were that age?  They still just had fucking hair where you had to pry that shit apart.  You pull your panties off.  Oxel Rose.  Oxel?  Oxel Rose.  Oxel Rose.  Oxel.  I tried too hard to force that in.  I heard it.  It was a terrible. 
[03:38:00]  Terrible attempt.  But you used to have to, like, kind of take your fingers and pull it apart.  It was like Velcro or Venus flytrap.  Never seemed to bother me.  It was like a Venus flytrap.  Never seemed to bother me.  No, I didn't care about that.  Wouldn't it be...  See, I was bringing this up the other day.  Wouldn't it be kind of refreshing?  And I'm not talking a giant fucking bush of hair.  But to see, like, a nicely groomed triangle shape.  No, it wouldn't be.  Like, some hair on there.  No.  Just, like, there was nothing better as a kid that when a girl would fucking get completely  naked and drop those fucking panties and you would see, like, tits in a fucking triangle 
[03:38:30]  of hair.  Just like Junior High.  It was like, that's fucking great.  Yeah, well, those old days when you got to third base, that was part of it.  You would get your hand in their panties and you'd feel that fucking bush.  Muff.  That's why it's called bush.  Yuck.  Pussy.  That's what it's called.  Yeah, and then you go dial something on a rotary phone.  Do you want that, too?  That fucking stinks.  Why don't you get in a fucking plane with a propeller?  Exactly.  Go watch Channel 2, 4, or 5. 
[03:39:00]  Just fuck yourself.  Anthony's, like, fingering a girl.  He's like, oh, my God, this is so hot.  Let me call my friend.  Bonfield 8.  Bonfield 8.  Anthony almost convinced us.  You almost convinced us.  You almost had us.  And then Jimmy fucking fucked it all up.  Yeah, exactly.  Dude, smell my fingers right after I fixed the rabbit ears on the television.  Connecting you now to Melrose 2.  Fucking A.  I hate hair.  I fucking hate it.  But I like the way it looks. 
[03:39:30]  You know what I don't like, though?  It's asshole hair.  When a girl's hair around her asshole.  See, that I actually like.  What about Kenya?  I like when a girl's asshole looks like the guy Bronson shot in Death Wish 2.  Do you believe in Jesus?  Yes, I do.  He's, like, bald on top.  Well, you're going to meet him.  It is amazing how girls always shave their legs, but they didn't shave their pussies.  Yeah.  But then all of a sudden.  Was it porno that made them start shaving their pussies?  I think it was.  I think it was the advent of videotape.  And then pornos being brought home.  Because a lot of women didn't see fucking porno. 
[03:40:00]  I remember having to get fucking, yeah, a rotary phone.  I found a porno on film once.  It was on 8mm film.  And this motherfucker.  Stag film.  Remember my buddy Joe Curry?  Get the mic on, Joe.  Get the mic on.  Get the mic on.  To high school.  Yeah.  And tell him that we were doing, like, a project to get the video player.  We watched 8mm porno films that we stole from your uncle.  Yeah, it was my uncle's stuff.  I took it and went to the school and said, I have to take an 8mm projector home.  And I signed one out, and we all just gathered around. 
[03:40:30]  We watched porno.  And there it is.  You know, the lights are out.  You know what's amazing?  It's amazing that they still make new porns.  I know.  Like, who the fuck has jerked off to all of them?  I mean, do they really need to make this?  Like, billions and billions.  Who's the guy that's showing up at the video store on Tuesday?  What do you got?  You got new?  Saw it.  You got new?  Saw everything.  Got it?  Saw everything.  But then, yeah, when the video stores, you know, the advent of the VCR, you go to the  video store and get porno, I think a lot of these women started saying, well, look at 
[03:41:00]  that.  My guy's watching this fucking porno.  This chick is shaved.  He must have liked shaved pussy.  Well, they weren't even shaved back then, though.  They also, they used to have porns where, like, one girl would be, like, shaving the  other girl, and that got kind of sexy, and those probably turned on the girls a lot.  Because they would, I mean, all the girls would watch, like, girl-on-girl porn.  That's usually their first experience with it.  I think by the time video really came out, where people had VCRs in their houses and  were watching video, I think girls were already starting to trim the sides up, getting the  landing strip of the Hitler mustache thing going. 
[03:41:30]  They were starting to groom it a little more.  I mean, we prefer the landing strip.  It's like star-driven now.  Like, there's, like, one girl that a guy gets obsessed with.  Sasha Gray, oh, what do you got?  What do you got?  And they get obsessed with jerking off to one chick.  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck?  I always do, though, I get weird where I get, like, a girl's like my girlfriend for  a while in my wanky life.  Yes, yes, that's what I'm talking about.  And I'm like, oh, this is the girl I'm into.  And then I dump them and move on to the next.  For me, it was Lucy Tai.  For me, it was Lucy Tai for, like, six months.  I jerked off to nothing but Lucy Tai.  I'm on this, but Eva Angelina at the moment is me, girl. 
[03:42:00]  What's her name?  Eva Angelina.  People's secretary?  Yeah.  I feel like he knows it.  I met her the other day at a gig, and I actually got starstruck.  It was just that weird thing.  I got starstruck, and I saw Lucy Tai at the airport.  I wanted to take a picture with Lucy Tai at the airport, and I panicked.  No, mine is that new one, fucking that model.  Miranda Kerr.  Yeah, Miranda Kerr.  Holy shit.  Is that a model?  Yeah, she's fucking retarded.  If the girls are really hot and if they're really well-known, I kind of lose interest, 
[03:42:30]  because I know that other guys...  Oh, dear.  That is now my fucking ultimate jerk-off fantasy shit.  No, she doesn't do porno?  Then this is nonsense.  Why are we with her?  Oh, she's a swimsuit?  So get the fuck out of here.  Amateurs.  Lucy Tai, back up.  Yeah, yeah.  What was that original search?  Lucy Tai?  Did you jerk off to Swimsuit Illustrated?  No, it was just she's fucking very hot.  Look at that dirty jungle bitch.  And there are some dudes to her.  Look at that.  But think about all the other guys.  What the fuck?  Wooden fucking clogs just climbed out of the jungle.  I don't like that.  I like that. 
[03:43:00]  It looks like you could go to Thailand and get that.  You can go to Thailand and get that.  All right.  Book a flight.  Doesn't that bother you, though?  Doesn't what bother me?  Doesn't that bother you that all of these other guys are also smacking it, thinking about  the same girl you are?  Ew.  I don't think about that.  Why would I waste my thoughts on that?  Doesn't that ever go through your mind?  Well, that's why I go more for the amateur porn.  When you fuck a chick, do you go, oh, she's been fucked by other guys?  Is that what you're thinking about?  Are you thinking of all the other cocks that have been inside her? 
[03:43:30]  This is just revealing how many hookers you guys have all had.  You're totally used to it.  Self-defeating thoughts aren't necessary.  I'm not here to consider her future, her past.  I'm here to jerk off to some crazy hot bitch that just looks like she just popped out  of the jungle.  Damn it.  You are right.  You're right.  This self-defeating, there's no need for it.  I need more positive thinking while I'm jerking off.  There's too many variables.  The whole fact that she needs the cash is a turn on for me.  Yeah. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, it really is.  I've got a weird thing.  The whole fact that she's been paid, I prefer that.  Do you wish that they discussed it in the video?  Like, okay, I'm going to give you $2,000.  You're going to suck my cock on video.  Okay.  Okay.  You like that?  If she could go, that's good.  I can't really make my bills this week.  How about you bring another guy in?  Really?  That would top it for me.  That is the best line.  Why is that?  I don't know.  I like demeaning people.  I think it's funny just to, like, I like girls with a sense of humor, so after having  some, you know, sex there in the bed, I like grabbing a hundred, throwing it on the dressing 
[03:44:30]  and going, buy yourself something pretty.  And then go to the bathroom.  And if they laugh, it's cool.  If they don't, then really get the fuck out.  What if they laugh and then they take the money?  Yeah.  They usually do, by the way.  Do they?  They do take the money.  Jokes take the money.  Do they do this for a joke?  Oh, I'm taking this guy.  It's a joke.  No, honestly, are they taking the money?  Yeah.  Of course they take the money.  Oh, women are hookers.  Oh, women are hookers.  In a way.  Well, you were talking about women are evil.  It's a funny little joke.  Secondly, it's like, fuck it.  A hundred bucks? 
[03:45:00]  Who cares?  She's fucking, you know.  She'll put in the effort again next time now because she thinks another hundred might  be coming.  It doesn't.  Would you take money for sex?  If a woman gave you a hundred bucks after sex, you would.  Fuck yeah.  Why not?  If I didn't have any money?  Fuck yeah.  If I was broke and some chick was rich and she threw a hundred bucks at me and she sucked  my dick?  Fuck yeah.  Congratulations.  That was a dumb question.  You just got a hundred bucks and you got blown.  I've taken chlamydia and herpes for it.  This is coming from a guy who burns his warts off every two months. 
[03:45:30]  Exactly.  Two months is a lie.  You're freezing.  He has to bring his cock to fucking Apex Tech from the guy.  Might be refreshing, actually.  It's refreshing for a girl to actually bring something good to the table.  I can walk away with money?  A hundred bucks?  Fuck yeah.  I don't have to walk away with degrading comments and tell me how my fucking apartment's a mess?  I can actually get money from this?  A guy who can get away with being a man whore, especially if a chick's got money, that's  why every guy with that Kevin Federline thing, when that guy got all that money, no guy hated 
[03:46:00]  on that guy.  He had zero respect when he was with her.  And then he got total respect when he fucking was gone and she paid him.  He did everything right.  He did everything right.  He took care of the kids, got a fuckload of money, and he got fat.  He's like, fuck it, I'm done.  I've got five million bucks in the bank.  I'm driving a Ferrari.  I've got Britney Spears kids.  I'm just going to eat like a fucking monster.  Yeah, but that was okay because it was Britney Spears.  Okay, Tom Arnold.  Yeah, that's no, nothing. 
[03:46:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, that's exactly.  You can't fuck everything for money.  You can't fuck everything for money.  No, no, no, no, yeah.  There's no respect for that.  No respect for that.  That's a job.  That's blatant.  That's like working at the docks.  He put in his hours.  Yeah.  He got his pension.  He's good.  He was a pioneer, though.  He was one of the first.  Yes, that's true.  You've got to give respect for that.  David Guest.  Man whore, kind of a man fucking leech.  He's actually quite a nice guy.  What about all those gay guys that Elizabeth, what's-her-face used to marry?  Oh, Elizabeth Taylor.  Yeah, she used to marry all those fucking gay guys.  Did she really? 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  Why were they gay?  They were just a mess.  Liza Minnelli married Peter Allen, didn't they?  Did she marry Rock Hudson?  Was Rock Hudson one of them?  I don't think they liked.  I think they wanted to be married but didn't want to have a dick in them or something.  That's what I don't get about gay guys.  Of course, Peter Allen must have fucked Liza Minnelli, right?  Maybe not.  Maybe not.  Maybe Liza doesn't like dick.  Who's the new guy that she's married to?  Well, they divorced, but he was another one that obviously,  he wasn't fucking her.  Peter Guest.  Was that his name?  Yeah, Peter Guest.  Peter Guest.  No, David.  David Guest. 
[03:47:30]  Who's Peter Guest?  He's the next person coming in.  David Guest.  David Guest.  He's a heterosexual, isn't he?  What a hack joke.  Wasn't he?  Was he a...  Whatever.  Whatever works.  Yeah, David Guest was another one.  I don't think they're consummating their fucking marriage.  No, look at that guy.  That guy.  Oh, please.  Poor fuck.  Oh, do you think he cries when he has to go down on her?  I don't think he has to go down on her.  We had that on our show.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  Joe, were you listening to us when we had a gay guy go down on a girl for tickets?  No, gay Marco.  Dude, greatest fit ever. 
[03:48:00]  That was.  We brought him to tears.  Where was this?  It was at NAW.  We had the hottest girl that came.  I mean, she was ridiculous.  Smoking hot.  And what was his name?  Marco.  Gay Marco.  Gay Marco.  He wanted tickets to NSYNC so bad.  We're like, if you...  NSYNC!  Oh, yeah.  We love NSYNC.  It makes it ten times gay.  I know.  It's great.  If you could last through one NSYNC song, we'll give you the tickets.  And I'm telling you, we didn't bring in a pig.  This girl was so hot.  And he actually...  You're leaving out a detail.  What's the detail?  Oh, that...  Well, she was on her period. 
[03:48:30]  No.  No, that's not...  That doesn't bother me.  No, no, that was...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I like pussy when the girl's on the period.  No, that was another bit.  That was another bit.  I don't give a shit.  So, Joe.  That doesn't bother me.  Joe, you can lick bits sometimes.  I don't give a fuck.  Lizzie Borden's parents.  Blood, to me, is just like pussy juice.  It's all just bodily fluid.  Oh, it's not the same.  I'll lick a bloody pussy.  It's like a stillborn child pulling out of the fluid.  While they're cum all over Jan K's suit.  What the fuck?  But Joe... 
[03:49:00]  Got some blood on Monica Lewinsky's dress.  He don't care.  He kneels down in front of the pussy, and he's brought to tears.  And he's like, what is that?  The first time he starts screaming.  He never saw a real live pussy.  And we did this on regular radio.  Oh, my God.  Regular radio.  We can't do that on satellite today.  Isn't it amazing what you used to be able to do?  We're not allowed to do it on even satellite.  On regular radio.  And he was yelling.  He goes, what is that?  What is that?  I don't know what that is.  Wait a minute.  You guys couldn't do that on satellite?  Nah, probably not.  No.  Probably not.  Fluids.  Fluids, penetration, all kinds of shit now.  They got some weird rules over here, Joe.  They don't like penetration for some reason. 
[03:49:30]  Live at the compound likes penetration, though, huh?  Fucking penetration.  You know it.  Yeah.  I was looking for a Craigslist chick or something.  I just want to...  I think it would be legal, right, to get normally a hooker, would normally be a hooker, and pay  her money, but not for sex, to come down and interview her at the compound, and just  have her maybe take a top off or some shit, and then interview about how her fucking uncle  fucked her in the ass or something. 
[03:50:00]  You can't have sex on it, because you can't film porn in New York legally.  No, no.  Not legally.  You can't film porn in New York?  No, I believe it's illegal to shoot porn.  That's hilarious.  But then again, for money.  It might be...  Burn our archives.  Jimmy De Laurentiis knows this.  Jimmy De Laurentiis.  Did you research this?  No, I just know a lot of guys that shoot it, and they're like, you're not supposed to  shoot it in New York.  But you can do it if they do it for free.  I believe you can.  Sure.  Free porn.  Because now, what happens with...  What's her name?  Fucking Amy Fisher did a porno at her house right there in Centauri. 
[03:50:30]  She got a permit.  Oh, I think maybe it's...  Got a permit.  I need a variance for fucking and filming.  So what's the deal with Spitzer?  Spitzer got busted for prostitution.  He's back.  He's back.  What is he doing?  Movie reviews.  He's back.  Movie reviews?  Movie reviews.  Porno reviews.  That would be awesome.  Maybe someone could back me up.  I think he's doing some kind of movie reviews.  He's pulling a Marion Barry.  God damn.  He's on real TV.  Well, I saw him talking about...  He had some really interesting points about how the whole financial system is basically  a gigantic Ponzi scheme. 
[03:51:00]  Right.  And he's saying that the reason why they went after him was because he was going after  all these, you know, various, you know, funds, various institutions.  Yeah, that was his job at the time, I guess.  Yeah, but his whole fucking thing was that he was chasing after prostitution.  And he was tough on these guys that were running these prostitution rings.  He put them in jail.  But how come he didn't get put in jail?  Joe, it sounds to me like a case of do as I say and not as I do.  Oh, Jim, Jim.  Oh, old saying, Jim.  That's right.  Old hat Jimmy. 
[03:51:30]  It's interesting.  He was a freak.  Apparently, he used to like to go bareback.  That was his thing.  Who doesn't?  Do you like the fuck with his socks on?  Not me.  I would fuck with a helmet on.  Oh, wow.  Oven mask, beekeeper's outfit.  You're a condom kind of guy?  No.  I fucking hate them.  You don't like condoms?  No, they're disgusting.  Can't even deal.  Well, I only fuck one chick right now, so I don't wear them.  When you were single?  I'd try to wear them.  I would fucking...  I would...  By the second pump, I worked the thumb where that fucker could come off with nary a fucking... 
[03:52:00]  On the backstroke, you get your thumb underneath the ridge and it comes right off.  Wow.  You slip it right back in.  No one even knows it's gone.  How do you not know?  She's a surprise for everyone.  She don't.  She don't fucking know.  She don't know.  I'm gone.  I'm gone.  She's stupid and numb.  Fuck it.  I only wear them for their safety.  And maybe...  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  You know my hardcore grade.  I know when fucking tax time is due.  My warts have to be burnt off.  Thanks.  That's funny.  Fucking Jeffries.  Every fucking two months. 
[03:52:30]  You know.  The last pump is always a surprise.  It's like, here you go.  Oh, oh, oh.  It broke suddenly, honey.  And then, boom.  What a dirty, dirty trick.  It's pristine on the floor, just laying there.  I don't think I've come inside a girl for a decade.  Sorry.  I just out and out lied.  You haven't come inside a girl for a decade?  I pull out on their face.  I'm respectful that way.  For the last 10 years?  I just don't want one.  10 years?  I don't...  Because I might want to go down on them later, and I want cum still sort of...  Yeah.  Not really. 
[03:53:00]  I don't come inside.  Have you ever gone down on a girl, and you realize that you came inside of her, and you're  probably eating your own cum?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've done that.  If I pump one in, though, it's going to be fucking deep.  Wow.  I'm going the distance.  It's going to stay up there?  I'm going Marianna's trench deep.  Yeah.  So that way, if I want to go down on her...  You're going to put her on her shoulders and keep her ass up in the air so it stays in?  Well, you know what it is?  Yeah, as long as they're not fucking riding a bicycle around the house, they're still laying  down on their back.  Then you could lick the clit without...  I'm not shoving my tongue in there, either.  You give a little clit diddle.  You might taste a little, you know...  Salty?  Something different. 
[03:53:30]  He stays up.  See, I'm cum in the ass, but I won't cum in the coat.  Really?  No, because I'm not going to be licking the ass for you.  It's not like Yafit Kodo fucked her and then I'm going down on her.  You don't eat ass?  I do eat ass.  You do eat ass, but not after you cum in it.  I believe his name is Alonzo Mosley.  But also, I don't eat sweaty ass.  I eat clean out of the shower ass.  I have to say so, you fucking rookie.  I don't think I'd ever lick ass after cumming in it.  No, I'm dumb.  We've had this discussion we made before.  You know what?  It all depends on how much I've had to drink. 
[03:54:00]  Dirty ass is fine, dude.  A couple of drinks, I'll dive right to fuck in.  I'll come right in.  I don't care what she's been doing.  Showered, waxed, baby cokes.  You're fucking crazy.  A couple of Jack and Cokes.  I don't give a fuck.  Oh, I thought you meant pouring in the ass.  That's a move, too.  Like in the old Western movies when a guy would get a break in his arm.  It was a cut.  They'd throw fucking whiskey on it.  Here, bite this stick.  She puts the stick in her mouth.  You put whiskey on her ass and dig in.  Watch it just go.  If you did and you see little things floating out of it.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:54:30]  Some girls got to realize, though, toilet paper can really, a little ball of toilet paper  can really ruin the whole thing.  It can ruin the experience.  Baby wipes.  Baby wipes.  Have you ever had a girl lick your ass and you're thinking, this isn't going to work out for her?  No, no, no.  And just the look of horror when they look up.  You ever had a girl lick your ass and you smell shit?  I just don't think I'll wipe my ass properly.  I won't allow it.  I will not allow it.  You've got to have your ass real clean.  It's a shame that I'm never going to kiss this girl in the mouth again.  Yeah, yeah.  I have a funky looking asshole. 
[03:55:00]  How do you even know?  I've never seen it.  I couldn't pick my asshole out in the lineup.  I got the issue.  I don't have any idea.  Is this your asshole, Mr. Rogan?  I don't know.  No, no, no.  I can't be sure.  I'm looking out to cut his asshole loose.  He couldn't identify.  That could be the greatest one asshole I'll never forget.  Are you ever going to get a funky looking asshole?  I don't even know.  I guess I wouldn't know if I looked at it once and was like, what the fuck is that?  Yeah.  If it was so different than any other asshole I'd ever seen.  Yeah, yeah.  Officer, it's the one winking at me. 
[03:55:30]  What's wrong with it?  I've got like a skin tag that's gone a bit weird.  From a hammer on the other.  What the fuck is going on?  I happen to have a camera and your asshole happens to be in the room.  He needs a photo.  So why don't we get a visual of this?  We're not the real.  We're going to see your skin tag.  Don't be shy.  Come on.  Come on.  Jim Jeffries, you don't give a fuck.  You're a wild man in Korea.  I can't have this out here.  You're a wild man.  Let's just see your butthole real quick.  This is going to be my new headshot.  Oh, Jim Jeffries.  Come on.  Let's see your butthole.  I'm not showing you much. 
[03:56:00]  Okay, okay.  No big deal.  No big deal.  It's all right.  We've got to wrap up.  We've got two minutes before the computer shuts us off.  Your asshole's got like a garbage can lid on it.  What time does the computer shut you guys off?  In two minutes from right now.  We've got to get the plugs in.  We really should get the plugs in.  Plugs in.  Plugs in.  I wish we were going to see his asshole.  Well, look.  Joe Rogan.  The Helium Comedy Club tonight, UFC tomorrow.  How far have we fucking slipped?  I know.  Exactly.  We just keep going deeper and deeper into the gutter.  Come on.  Let's see your asshole.  What's the big deal?  Rogan.  Totally doesn't seem gay at all.  Jimmy, you try.  This is just an oddity. 
[03:56:30]  Joe Rogan tonight in Philadelphia at the Helium Comedy Club.  There's two shows.  One of them sold out.  The other one will sell out.  Of course, UFC 101 tomorrow night.  BJ Penn is fighting.  Forrest Griffin is fighting in Philadelphia.  Jim Jeffries is just hanging.  He's not plugging anything for myself.  End of the summer, August, 21, 22.  Club Casbah in Wildwood.  I haven't been there in fucking years.  Wait, maybe Jeffries is plugging something.  No, he said he's not.  Nothing?  Edinburgh Festival, if you're listening online.  What do you wear?  I can plug a movie I do with Jim Norton.  Oh, yeah.  Our documentary. 
[03:57:00]  Well, there's a lot of people listening online, right?  Joe Curry at McGuire's.  When?  Tonight and tomorrow.  And tomorrow at McGuire's.  And me and Devin did a documentary called Courting Condi, where he was trying to date Condoleezza Rice,  and I haven't seen it for a minute.  It's fantastic.  Jim Norton has one of the most brilliant cameos.  Is she single?  I've ever seen in it.  I don't know.  She is very single.  Is she?  She's very, very single.  Wow.  And a virgin.  I don't like that.  Is that what you're implying?  That is what we're implying, because we interviewed his fiancee, her fiancee, who she turned down,  and she said that she would save herself. 
[03:57:30]  She would only have sex once she got married.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  And she's never been married.  Well, that's strange.  Dude, she's 55 years old and never been married.  How could a person like that ever be representing a sizable population?  Yeah, without knowing what everyone else does.  How great a cock is?  I just spoke.  But what is on most everyone's mind in the world all the time?  Yeah, breeding. 
[03:58:00]  And you don't know anything about it?  And you're 50.  That is fucked up.  Holy shit.  She just said she was saving herself for marriage, and she's still not married yet.  That's incredible.  Why save that?  We're gone.  The computer's going to knock us out.  Bye, guys.  See you.  We're all heading to Philly to continue the party.  We'll see you guys Monday.  Holla. </pre>
