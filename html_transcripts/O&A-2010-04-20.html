<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with a discussion of a *Back to the Future*-esque movie plot, quickly descending into crude sexual humor involving Ben Franklin and bestiality.  Dr. Michu Kaku was mentioned as a guest who seemingly remained unaffected by the hosts' vulgarity. This segued into a discussion about Adolf Hitler's birthday, encompassing his life, historical impact, related memorabilia, the Columbine shooting, Nazi symbolism, WWII artifacts, and the design of Nazi uniforms.  Listeners called in with varied reactions, some supportive, others offended. The conversation also included tangents on food preferences and personal anecdotes.  Studio guests during this segment included Adam Carolla, Megan McCain, and Jim Norton.  Hitler’s artwork and its value were also briefly discussed.

The show then shifted to the unexpected success of *Kick-Ass*, contrasting the hosts’ initial negative reaction with its box office performance, and mentioning Bob Kelly’s recommendation. This led to a discussion of the Montreal Canadians' hockey loss and a related betting pool.  The leaked Gizmodo photos of the next-generation iPhone became a major focus, with speculation about the source of the leak (accident, publicity stunt, hoax) and discussions of the phone's features. Callers offered various theories, including a claim from a self-proclaimed Apple employee.  The segment revisited a humorous edited compilation of Rich Voss's tech support calls, followed by a discussion of Opie's old, highly offensive WBAB theme song, Sharon Osbourne's plans for her breast implants, and a new Ozzy Osbourne song.

The next segment started with another discussion about a forgotten theme song from their NYC radio days and a debate about New England and New York sports teams.  This transitioned to Green Day's Broadway show, sparking a debate about their musical evolution and jukebox musicals in general. A caller brought up Green Day's political leanings, leading to a discussion about bands alienating fans with politics, and various Broadway musicals (Beatlemania, Jersey Boys, a rumored U2 show) were mentioned before moving on to the upcoming *Iron Man* movie and Terrence Howard's absence.  Green Day's album sales (*Dookie* and *American Idiot*) were also compared.  Listener calls then followed, including discussions about Oprah Winfrey's response to a biography and the band "Another Color," who recorded Opie's WBAB jingle.  A video of an obese woman attempting to become the world's heaviest person was analyzed, prompting a discussion about the Guinness Book of World Records and questionable record attempts. Jim Norton's appearance on Jay Leno and his "Chip" persona were also discussed.

The latter part of this segment focused on Opie's sleep problems, with callers and Dr. Steve offering sleep remedies (ranging from sensible to bizarre, including yoga on TV).  The conversation veered into pornography and discussions of penis size, punctuated by a brief mention of the space shuttle landing.  Listeners continued to offer sleep advice.

Another segment prominently featured a discussion about sleep, prompted by Anthony's extreme tiredness. It involved mocking Steve Ross's yoga program, discussing sleep remedies (Valerian root and a crude joke about Dr. Steve's prostate), and Dr. Steve offering sleep advice (emphasizing relaxation and recommending exercise).  Anthony detailed an 18-hour nap, Twitter comments with crude jokes about Dr. Steve were read, and Dr. Steve explained a faster-than-light speed phenomenon as an optical illusion.  Jim’s near-bomb joke was cut short. Dr. Steve then departed.

The remainder of this segment focused on a promotional piece for Scorch's "PFG TV" show, showcasing clips of his awkward interactions with Nick, "Weird News" segments, and "Animals on Drugs" segments. The show's low production value and Scorch's questionable claims were repeatedly mocked. Scorch’s "Paws for a Cause" event was discussed.  The segment ended with a technical issue—all hosts' left headphones dying—and a discussion of a Spice Girls doll found in E-Rock's office.

The final segment centered on E-Rock's Spice Girls doll, his surprisingly good recall (though limited) of "Wannabe" lyrics, and several unrelated tangents including speculation about people outside the studio and a deeply cynical and offensive fictional advertisement for a mental health center, voiced by Jim Norton. Sam Roberts was briefly mentioned as doing a segment called "Backstage with ONA".


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All right, this is a good little examination here.  Let's look at the plot elements they ripped off from Back to the Future.  Time travel.  They didn't rip that off from Back to the Future.  Disappearing if your parents don't connect.  Yes, that happened.  Playing a song from the future that everybody loves.  Yes, that happened.  Having someone stay behind in the past.  Yes.  And fighting against a group of young men.  Yes. 
[00:00:30]  And the 80s.  Yes.  What a ruck.  All right, there he goes.  Dr. Michu Kaku.  Dr. Michu Kaku.  Very interesting.  I love when we touch on, like, you slip in a sexual thing or a curse, and he doesn't acknowledge it.  He just pretends like it didn't.  Like, it never happened.  He doesn't even hear it.  He hears everything else but...  Listen to a wormhole.  I wanted to talk about Ben Franklin and how he invented bifocals so he could lick a French girl's pussy and look at her tits just by looking up and down. 
[00:01:00]  Because he sucked your horn dog.  Dude, reading had nothing to do with it.  That guy loved his French chicks.  And he wanted to, like, be able to see the clit, so he'd look down his nose, and then he looks up at the titties through the top part.  And look at her eyes to see if she's enjoying it.  Has anyone here actually sucked off a big, fat horse cock before?  What do you think of the cum?  Get the fuck out of here.  Anyone answering this?  Uh, it says, no, but I would in a heartbeat.  I would almost do any animal after today. 
[00:01:30]  I had my first experience.  Wow.  Sounds good, Stormy.  Tell us more.  That was Stormy.  Uh, mmm.  Such a nummy title for the thread.  Drool.  Hopi and Anthony.  Live next.  No Friends of the Dead  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:06:00]  Hey.  Enough palaver.  Enough palaver.  Hi, everybody.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Happy birthday.  All right.  I'll be a good boy.  Are you excited?  I woke up thinking, happy birthday to you.  Oh, but I'm going to be a good day.  But then I realized, you know, my birthday is like next week.  Is this schtick or are you really into Hitler's birthday? 
[00:06:30]  No, I'm not into Hitler's birthday.  I'm just into the era and the memorabilia and history of the whole thing.  Right.  Not as a white supremacist or a neo-Nazi.  You know, it's just part of history.  Like people go, oh, today is Gandhi's birthday or today was Winnie Churchill's birthday or  something like that.  I'm just acknowledging today is Adolf Hitler's birthday.  Adolf. 
[00:07:00]  Adolf.  Adolf as the proper pronunciation.  And we should be in lockdown today, right?  Should we be in lockdown?  Well, some bad things have happened on April 20th over the years.  Well, yeah.  We've had a few bad ones.  No?  That does seem to be a big day when it comes to shenanigans and hijinks.  I'll give you one.  Yeah.  Fenway Park opened 98 years ago today.  I see.  That's a bad one.  That's a horrible, horrible thing in history that happened.  Fagway.  And, of course, Columbine, which the media blew out of proportion, 
[00:07:30]  making it very easy for disgruntled kids to reenact that fucking massacre.  To just really take it and make it their own.  Oh, of course.  You know?  Media clueless how they pushed that one forward.  Yeah.  And made that one even bigger than it was.  Yeah.  It was pretty big, but I mean...  Of course it was pretty big.  They almost made Dylan and fucking...  Well, they glorified the whole thing.  Eric and Dylan.  Yeah.  They made him, like, most folk hero-y. 
[00:08:00]  Don't we have our Columbine song?  Holy shit, I hope not.  I have no idea.  Do we have our Columbine song?  Wasn't that part of the Most Defensive Song contest?  Most Defensive Song.  The most offensive song you've ever heard.  Now, are we a lot of...  Well...  Probably not.  I have no idea.  Why not?  It's a look back.  It is a look back, all right.  All right, well...  I don't even know where some of that material is.  Some of that material is buried somewhere. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Never to see the light of day again, I guess.  Like Hitler.  Sorry.  It's just on my mind.  Are you really excited about this Hitler thing?  I can't figure you out.  No, I'll probably...  Like, when I go home, I'm sure the History Channel has a lot of Hitler stuff on it.  Because it's his birthday, so I'll, you know, I'll probably check that out.  It's a historic thing.  It was, you know, the biggest piece of history in the 20th century. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, but Obama's part of history.  You wouldn't celebrate his birthday.  Well, maybe.  You would have a lot of yucks if it was his birthday.  If he starts up with some genocide shenanigans in years to come, maybe he'll be looked at through history.  And how old would Adolf have been today?  Oh, my God.  Is it 119, or is that an older...  How old would Hitler be today?  See, if I was really excited about it, I would know. 
[00:09:30]  I would know.  When was he born?  18 fucking 90-something?  1889?  Yeah.  Was he born in 1889?  So he'd be 121 years old today.  Ah, that's a lot of candles.  How do you get that much fire on a cake?  Hmm.  You can't just burn candles.  Let me think.  Hmm.  You're really into this Hitler thing.  No!  I'm just thinking it's, you know... 
[00:10:00]  You got a pep in your step today.  Did I have a pep?  I just got a good night's sleep.  You even said that to me.  He goes, I slept like a baby for once.  I did.  It was just a nice, relaxing evening.  I think I'm going to go home and watch Downfall.  It's a good movie.  You ever see Downfall?  No.  You watch it backwards, though.  I've had no desire to see Downfall.  I like watching it backwards.  It becomes a good story, then?  Yeah, when it's backwards and...  Well, how does it become a good story if it's backwards?  Well, it doesn't end so sad. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, I see.  You know.  But wouldn't the movie start slow, so then it ends slow?  Who cares?  As long as the ending isn't sad.  Doesn't every movie start slow?  Yeah.  I don't care.  Start with a big bang, literally.  You're like a kid going on a field trip today.  Well, there's so much.  You've got a good night's sleep.  Oh, and look who I'm welcoming to the chat room right now.  Steve from Bayshore.  Oh, brother.  Another man.  I'm sure I'll get a...  Another racist fuck.  Racist fuck? 
[00:11:00]  My goodness.  Another racist.  I'm sure I'll get a nice message from Steve.  I believe it's probably a year ago that we did a show from the compound, me and Steve.  For Hitler?  On Hitler.  Well, no.  But it was on Hitler's birthday.  Are you doing a show today for Hitler's birthday?  No, it's a Tuesday.  It's very difficult to do a show on a Tuesday.  Why is it difficult?  Because of the brewski angle? 
[00:11:30]  Well, if I step down through that basement door, I'm drinking.  So I try to lock the basement door during the week.  Is it on lockdown?  It's like a monster down there.  The door shakes.  I hear banging on it, and I just know Budweiser's down there.  That's what I meant by lockdown.  Your basement's on lockdown.  I lock down my basement so the beer can't get me.  You're sort of not drinking on the weekdays.  Is that true?  Yes.  That is what I'm doing, and it's...  A little rough?  It's not the easiest thing to do, because beer is very good, and it's very convenient. 
[00:12:00]  And it's almost healthy, right?  And it's, well...  Doesn't it help the heart?  Actually, they say a glass of red wine.  But the glass is a giant carafe that I like to use.  It is made of glass, and there's red wine in it.  But, no, I'm really steering clear.  Unless I go out for something, a social reason on a weekday.  Then I'll have some cocktails.  But, I mean, if I'm just sitting at home, normally I would sit and watch maybe Hitler's bodyguards, or the Gestapo, things like that. 
[00:12:30]  Are you into this Hitler?  Well, I enjoy history and that part of history.  You got hidden tats.  Hidden?  You got some tats?  What do you mean by hidden?  Do you got hidden tats under there?  I can say I've never gotten a tat in my life.  I am tatless, as they say.  Prove it.  Strip down nude.  You want me to get nude right now?  Well, not really, I guess. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, my goodness.  That's going to be a little awkward for everybody.  You know what?  The thing about Nazi tats are, very hard to get a job with a Nazi tat.  Not if they're hidden, though.  Very hard to go to the beach.  Not if they're hidden.  Well, where are you hiding them if you go to the beach?  Because then you make problems with the people on the beach that don't quite appreciate your look at things.  It's like the Confederate flag has gotten this bad stigma over the years.  And people look at it like, you know, people are actually getting flack for being, 
[00:13:30]  daughters and sons of the Confederate.  And there's a Confederate commemoration day that recently came under fire.  And you can't really fault people in the South for being proud of whatever their forefathers did as far as fighting,  even if the cause wasn't just in the long run.  Those Confederate flags are still freaking flying high, man.  Well, you know what?  A lot of government buildings used to fly high.  You remember when we went down to Georgia?  Well, a lot of them, oh, Jesus. 
[00:14:00]  Wow, what's that one?  It's a bunch of LOLs, and the last L is all linked together to form a swastika.  Very creative, that one.  Very creative.  I wonder what he's laughing out loud at.  Yeah, people are getting very upset, though, with the Confederate flag.  As the years go by, they're really getting upset with even just the, they see it as the swastika.  Right.  It would be like having a state flag with the swastika incorporated into it. 
[00:14:30]  So people get very angry with it.  But I see no problem with things like that.  And even German soldiers weren't necessarily Nazis.  They were fighting under the flag of the Nazis and Hitler, but they were fighting for their brothers and for Germany, but not necessarily Nazis.  You know, you get things like the SS, they were Nazis.  Are you trying to justify it a little bit here?  No, I'm just saying that not every Nazi, German soldier, not Nazi soldier, every German soldier was a Nazi, and they were fighting just like any other country would send men to fight. 
[00:15:00]  Even though I said, like I said, the cause was not just and good, but they were put in a situation where they were sent off to war.  And if you watch a lot of these programs that I watch, they do interviews with these people, and you realize that they were just fighting for a cause and didn't like, you know, the politics of the whole thing.  But as you would fight for your brother that is next to you in the trenches, as you fight for your country and for the people around you, that is what they were doing. 
[00:15:30]  They weren't necessarily all fighting for Hitler and his genocide and whatnot.  You do realize a lot of Jews run Sirius XM satellite radio, right?  And that's why I'm not really going balls out with this.  You know, that's why I'm keeping it very tame.  You do realize pretty much everyone above us on the next floor are all Jews. 
[00:16:00]  I defy anybody of any ethnic background to come up with anything I've said so far and find it offensive.  This is fact.  This is just some factoid fact, factual information on what happened many years ago and how it is perceived today.  And the place in history that people like Stalin and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and Adolf Hitler have in history. 
[00:16:30]  It is – these are people that shaped history, that made crossroads in history, that were taken and that give us the earth that we have today.  You do realize our boss's last name is Greenstein, right?  I do understand that.  All right.  I do understand that.  Lucky for you, I don't think he's ever heard our show, so you're safe.  But –  I think you're safe.  He never listens to this garbage.  Why would you listen to one of the big shows on your platform? 
[00:17:00]  Why?  Well, you know, it's –  Oh, my God.  It's just – so when you get a day commemorating the birthday of somebody that really set the course of history in the 20th and into the 21st century, you do acknowledge it.  I'm not saying celebrate it or anything.  A lot of white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups do celebrate the birthday of Adolf Hitler, but I acknowledge it as another man in history that sort of set the tone for the 20th century and brought on the Cold War through his defeat, and we still live with the effects very much so today. 
[00:17:30]  Did you bring any party games?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A few party games.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Swastikas and ladders.  Let's say hi to –  The Game of Life.  Josh in Colorado.  Very different one.  Josh.  Spin the spinner and oops.  Hello? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  What's up, Josh?  You guys need to reflect on all the good Hitler's done.  Holy shit.  Do you realize that the factory that made the Tiger tanks, a very formidable tank back in World War II, was –  Was it the number one tank in the war?  It was a good one.  Oh, it was a goddamn good tank back in its day.  Right.  Porsche.  A gentleman named Porsche built that tank in his factories. 
[00:18:30]  Later, to come out with the car that is driven by a lot of Jewish people, along with Mercedes.  Well, that must be a fine car if they're –  Lufthansa Airlines.  Well, slow down.  The Porsche must be a fine car if they're willing to ignore –  Yes.  – how they got the technology for that fine machine.  Ferdinand Porsche actually had his factory making Tiger tanks for the German army back in World War II. 
[00:19:00]  Wow.  And, wow.  Volkswagen, of course.  The people's car.  The Autobahn.  The highway system around Germany that we adapted to the United States with the Eisenhower interstate system.  came directly from German engineering.  The V-2 rocket, which reigned horror down upon England at the end of the war,  was used by Americans and captured German scientists to launch our space crew program. 
[00:19:30]  All this would not have been done had it not been for Adolf Hitler and his blitzkrieging his ass through Europe.  Feeling okay?  I feel fine.  I'm just saying that you have to sometimes look at the big picture.  He did horrible things.  Horrible things.  Genocide. 
[00:20:00]  But through war and through the nightmare of war,  there are things that come out that have made our lives better today.  That's all I'm saying.  We had our own atrocities that were committed by American generals and American commanders and American soldiers  that in some way, shape, or form give us the nation we have today.  Let me public it.  Yes?  Let me pump this up for you.  I'm a lemons into lemonade kind of guy, Opie. 
[00:20:30]  Continue.  Do you have a march?  I'd rather have a good march.  That's...  This is too American.  But yes, we adapted many things from many horrible things that have happened throughout history  and incorporated them into our daily lives.  And incorporated them into our daily lives, making American life that much easier.  And what I'm saying is, the years that Adolf Hitler and the Nazi army were sweeping and horrifying Europe, 
[00:21:00]  certain things came out of that that we use today with a smile on our face.  That has made our lives more convenient through German engineering.  You know, they did some horrible things, Opie.  But those German engineers, even today, they, boy, their tolerances are plus or minus ten thousandths of an inch.  You've got to give it to them. 
[00:21:30]  Jesus.  All right.  Let's say hi to Ed in New York City.  Ed, what's going on, buddy?  Hi, Ed.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Yes, the Germans also perfected radar technology, which is still being used today by the American military.  They were able to detect aircraft that were approaching their shores.  Well, let me tell you something.  The English were very good at that.  They actually set up radars, radar stations all along their eastern coast. 
[00:22:00]  And when German planes would come over, it was the English that knew the Germans were coming.  And they had no clue.  They'd fly right over the towers and not even know what the fuck they were, the Germans.  But the English were able to do it.  And I'm sure they took it and just made it better.  Absolutely.  You're absolutely right.  The Germans absolutely made the radar technology much better.  And the advances that are being used today, that were used by the Germans, are still being used today.  Exactly.  And let's not forget the style and fashion, Opie. 
[00:22:30]  When we look back at the Nazi army, the German army, and then the Nazis, the SS, the high-ranking officers, Heinrich Himmler, Goebbels, Goering, even though he was a fat fuck.  He was a fat guy.  Oh, was he a fat fuck?  What was his problem?  He was in charge of the Luftwaffe.  He couldn't stop eating.  Did he get his stomach stapled?  No.  Yes, hello. 
[00:23:00]  I'm in charge of the Luftwaffe.  He never got a stomach stapled?  I would like a Luftwaffe, please.  Yes, I'm starving.  But, oh, the fashion that these Nazi officers had with the long leather and the jacked boots.  Who designed the uniforms?  Wasn't it someone pretty famous?  Rumor has it, I'm sure Steve from Bayshore knows exactly who designed those wonderful German uniforms. 
[00:23:30]  Hugo Boss perhaps had something to do with it.  Is that a rumor or is that true?  That's pretty much yes.  That's a pretty much yes.  Yeah.  And if you look at Hugo Boss, very successful these days.  Very successful designer.  But, you know, kind of had a hand in making the German officers look pretty snappy.  And look at the German Army helmet, Opie, which looks much like a perfect head of a penis.  Wonderful.  The American Kevlar helmet brought up after the Vietnam War adapted to the shape of the World War II era German helmet. 
[00:24:00]  Just showing the superiority in engineering in that day and age of the helmet, which would more come down lower to protect the ears and behind the head more than the American steel pot helmet of the past.  So basically what you're saying, if it wasn't for that Jew killing thing, we probably would have the day off today. 
[00:24:30]  Let me tell you something.  This would probably be a holiday for Americans even.  If it wasn't for the millions upon millions of people that died due to Hitler's want of genocide, there might have been a different sentiment toward the gentleman.  We would have had a white sale today.  Because there could have been a car dealership, a bunch of people would have been going around with the little mustaches. 
[00:25:00]  We would have had some barbecues going on today.  There could have been backyard barbecues, all kinds of the fun stuff that we get on a President's Day or MLK Day or any of the various holidays that are based on people's birthdays.  So basically because of the genocide, he ruined it.  Because of the genocide, he kind of wrecked his legacy of, you know, improving.  Germany and building their spirits up after the embarrassing defeat of World War I and the Treaty of Versailles, which pretty much castrated Germany, 
[00:25:30]  and put Hitler in the position where he was able to unite a defeated population.  Let's say hi to Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Hey.  So, Anthony, you are great.  But I've got to say, at some point, the German rants, a little crazy, have got to scare off the women.  What?  I'm just, I'm talking history here. 
[00:26:00]  You know, we better remember history lest we repeat it.  How many penthouse pets want to hear about Hitler?  Believe me, the last one I talked to.  More than you think.  The last one I sat to dinner with was kind of a fan of, ooh.  Oh, well.  I'll just be honest with you.  You'd be surprised.  All right.  How many white chicks are into neo-Nazism? 
[00:26:30]  Oh, my God.  Is that a way to get white chicks?  And you know you're getting a white chick.  Let's go to Eric in Orlando.  Eric.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  What's up, Eric?  Well, I want to agree with Anthony.  I'm a big fan of the era, just like Anthony.  The era.  I'm thankful for my great-grandfather being in the Wehrmacht with the items he left behind.  Ah, in the Wehrmacht.  How nice.  Yes, he was also in World War I, and I have a few of his things.  Wow.  Must have been a trooper.  I've got his G43 sniper rifle with scope. 
[00:27:00]  The prize 1942 Luger P08 9mm.  Wow.  His Wehrmacht uniform with two bullet holes in the arm.  Do you put it on every so often and just walk around the house?  You know, if he wasn't 6'4", I might have just worn it as a goof.  What a tall, strapping Nazi your grandpa was.  And as for modern technology, I'm thankful for my prize Audi TT Quattro that prominently  displays the Wow 1 Wow license plate.  Look at that. 
[00:27:30]  Wow 1 Wow, yes.  Wow 1 Wow.  Of course.  I've seen that one, by the way.  Yeah, that was mine.  Yes, I remember that.  Very good, sir.  Let me go to Kent in Georgia.  Kent.  Genocide, please.  No, see, I'm not.  Is that what you're saying today, Ian?  See, this is where rumor and innuendo get started.  I am not celebrating that man's birthday.  I am not celebrating the sick genocide that took place under Hitler's rule. 
[00:28:00]  I am not.  Do not get me wrong.  I am saying this was a man in history that shaped the 20th century and beyond through his  actions.  And this has to be acknowledged.  You can acknowledge without celebrating is what I am saying.  Why are my hands waving around and my hair's going wild? 
[00:28:30]  Because you're very excited today.  Oh my God.  You're extremely excited.  There you go.  This is a man who needs to be acknowledged as somebody in the 20th century that shaped  our societies as we live them today.  Boo!  We would not have many of the things we have today if it was not for Adolf Hitler.  It is just an acknowledgement that he was part of history in the 20th century. 
[00:29:00]  And we would not have many things we have without Adolf Hitler having been a part of the 20th  century.  He did bring many things to the world.  I'm just saying.  The whole genocide thing.  That's, you know, that was bad.  Bad. 
[00:29:30]  Leave the Jews alone.  They were just hanging out.  And you needed an escape coat.  So, you needed a escape coat.  So, you know, you picked on the Jews and various other ethnic backgrounds.  But, you know, the Jews took the brunt of it.  That was the crazy Hitler.  Crazy Hitler.  You know, you get a guy that wants to build his country up and, you know, kind of get the  infrastructure back and recover from the embarrassment of the Treaty of Versailles. 
[00:30:00]  Perhaps you look at that, even rolling into Poland.  How bad was that?  Jesus.  But then the English and French had a good.  All right.  Look, I'm not saying that.  That was bad, too.  All right.  Now that I think back, perhaps that was bad, too.  Might have been a bit of a problem.  And he was.  Thank you.  He was kind of a good painter.  Do you ever see some of his pictures and portraits that he painted?  I have not.  They really are quite lovely. 
[00:30:30]  Why don't you purchase one?  Hold on.  Who did you just get me with that?  The thought of an original a Hitler hanging in my house is too much to even bear.  Imagine an original a Hitler hanging up in the house.  Well, your birthday's coming up.  How much could these things go for?  Look how good he was.  Look, that ain't bad.  That sucks.  Everything's very German.  Oh, my God.  Looks extremely German.  Painted a lot of Austria, didn't he? 
[00:31:00]  He...  What does that go for?  What does a basic Adolf Hitler painting go for?  A Hitler go for?  Maybe, you know, that would take over the spot over the fireplace, by the way.  I would have to hang an original...  You would have to take down the flag, then.  And also, why the outrage when people want...  I hit the flag, okay.  Why the outrage if someone wanted to buy one of his paintings?  Attract big sale prices.  Hitler's art attracts big sale prices. 
[00:31:30]  Let's see.  The artworks by the Nazi leader fetched almost $120,000.  The watercolor was one of 15 items of Hitler art being sold at auction.  Together, the artworks by the Nazi leader fetched almost $120,000.  For 15 paintings, they had an...  Expect to raise under $50,000.  Wait, did he get one for how much?  Wait, what about one?  That sounded like 15...  You got 15 for 120 Gs? 
[00:32:00]  I'm in!  Hey, Hitler's in every room!  That's a weekend at the Borgata, man.  Holy shit, exactly!  Fucking get a painting.  It's a day at the...  That's a hand at the Borgata.  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Jared!  Hey, guys.  Hey, something else the Germans perfected.  They're very good at this.  Chicken fucking.  Yes.  We never would have had the...  Think of all the laughs that we have had over the years with the chicken fucker.  Never would have had it because... 
[00:32:30]  The mindset of defeat wouldn't have been there.  The mindset of degradation...  Degradation would not have been there.  Travis, do we have that?  Original watercolor painting.  Hold on a minute.  Ah.  How much?  Ah, no.  Ah, no.  Ah, no. 
[00:33:00]  Ah, no.  See?  Happy birthday.  Here's the chicken fucker for Hitler's birthday.  This is what he...  This is what he made.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ah, no, that's good.  That's good.  Yeah.  Like.  That's a chicken crying. 
[00:33:30]  Ah, the chicken.  Oh, my God.  This is what it sounds like when chickens cry.  Ah, brah, brah.  Ah, brah, brah.  Ah, brah, brah.  Ah, brah.  Let's see how to curse in Texas.  Chris.  Yeah.  You guys heard of a country called Iran?  Doing us a little bit of a bellyache these days.  They used to be called Persia.  But Hitler convinced him to change the name to Iran, which means Aryan. 
[00:34:00]  Aryan, Iran.  No kidding, really?  Is that true?  It used to be Persia.  All right, we're learning a lot today.  See?  So he was able to perpetuate our hatred for other countries even long after he's gone.  Greg in D.C.  Greg!  Good morning, boy.  Hello, Greg.  I was calling because Hitler wasn't all good.  And it's partially his fault that we have to be the babysitters of the world because  we were isolationists until, you know, he and Japan decided to do some, pull some little 
[00:34:30]  shenanigans.  Well, let me tell you something.  It also made us the superpower that we are because we, it was necessary to come up with  things like the atomic bomb.  Also, Stalin decided, hey, the war's over.  I'm going to grab every fucking bit of real estate that the Germans took.  Look, and if it wasn't for the United States and England being as powerful, especially  the United States after the war, they would have just swept in and taken everything. 
[00:35:00]  And we were able to hold them at bay.  And the Cold War started as a direct result of World War II.  And again, you got to look at the Cold War with the good and the bad.  A lot of technology came out of us trying to keep them from their shenanigans.  I'm surprised this took so long.  Joe in Pennsylvania.  Joe.  Oh, Joe.  Hey, guys.  I've been listening for a long time.  Called the show many times.  But Anthony, you're a rabid supportive Hitler.  It's just hitting a little too close to home today for me. 
[00:35:30]  Hitting too close to home.  You are misunderstanding.  Do I need to explain myself again that I am not celebrating this man's hatred and genocide?  I am not celebrating at all.  I am observing.  I, as a historian, as an amateur historian that I fancy myself, I am observing the fact  that this day in history is Adolf Hitler's birthday.  And what he did through history and his effect on us even to this day throughout history of 
[00:36:00]  the 20th and into the 21st century.  That is what I'm saying.  I am not a neo-Nazi.  I am not celebrating what he did as far as his genocide and hatred and just insanity goes.  I am looking at things that happened during that era on all sides, the Axis and the Allied  side, that gave us the way of life we lead today.  So we must acknowledge that this man did exist and not always just look at it like, okay, 
[00:36:30]  everyone thinks Adolf Hitler and thinks genocide, Holocaust, millions of people dead.  Of course, that is part of it.  But on this birthday, I do like to acknowledge the historical implications just beyond that,  that are responsible because of Adolf Hitler, because of Winston Churchill, because of Eisenhower  and Truman and Roosevelt and Tojo and all the emperor, all the motherfuckers from... 
[00:37:00]  It's so close to home.  Joe, why does it hit so close to home?  See, that would mean you...  Where'd you live, Dresden?  Why does this hit so close to home, Joe?  I went to the Holocaust Museum this one time, and it was like really sad.  They have a gift shop.  Was it?  I bet.  I've been ready to stage an intervention for Anthony at the Holocaust Museum.  Hey, look, I walked through the Holocaust Memorial they have in Boston. 
[00:37:30]  Remember that?  No surprise, right, Jimmy?  Jimmy has just arrived from L.A.  No surprise.  I walked through the Holocaust Memorial.  I'm in hell.  Memorial.  Guess who's celebrating Adolf Hitler's birthday since 6 o'clock?  I'm not celebrating.  I'm observing the fact that he was part of history, and we have to look at everything.  He's beyond excited.  That this man did, and how it shaped the 20th and into the 21st century, beyond just...  When people say Adolf Hitler, you always think the Holocaust, millions dead. 
[00:38:00]  I'm not talking about that.  What's Mussolini's birthday?  I have no clue.  Exactly.  What's that hack wannabe?  What's Idi Amin's birthday?  Oh, stop it.  What's my fucking birthday?  Who the fuck up is Jimmy?  Every day, apparently.  Jimmy, I said that exact thing.  I said, did you?  Yeah.  You're not celebrating Obama's birthday ever.  I am not celebrating.  I am observing, and this is a guy that in the 20th century had an impact that kind of spawned the other Mussolini and other dictators of the time and after. 
[00:38:30]  I am just saying that many things happened in history because of World War II and because of Hitler's overzealousness to take back the pride of his country.  But you got Joe on the phone, and he's not happy with you, Anthony.  I don't blame him.  You're taking gold teeth and making lemonade.  There it is.  There it is.  No. 
[00:39:00]  I don't think my point's getting across here.  Your point has to be getting across.  You're not allowing anyone else in today.  All right.  It's been a monologue since 6 o'clock.  Continue, Joe.  Shit.  Joe.  I got nothing.  Punch it out.  Yeah, there he is.  All right, let's say hi to Larry King.  Larry.  Opie, how important is the theme song? 
[00:39:30]  What was that?  Oh, Jimmy perked up like, what was that?  I don't know what that is.  That is an atrocity second to Hitler's theme song.  I don't know what that is.  What was that?  Oh, boy.  I fucking hate Danny.  Wait, did that say Opie's on?  Is that what that's in or no?  Oh, it certainly did.  Wait.  Well, you just got here, Jimmy.  I just got here.  Why don't you settle in a little bit and maybe we can get into that a little later.  What is that?  Jimmy is so happy right now.  Look at the smile.  You look like a little boy on Christmas. 
[00:40:00]  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Sean.  Would it be safe to say that the first 15 minutes of Inglourious Bastards is running  on a constant loop at Anthony's house today?  I find that first 15 minutes of Inglourious Bastards an amazing part of cinema.  It is quite astounding.  The fear that the Nazi officer is striking into that family by just smiling and being pleasant 
[00:40:30]  is a great acting job by, what was his name?  Something German.  But he, yeah, Hans.  Hans Gruber.  That was it.  Just fantastic.  Yes, it runs on a constant loop.  Let's say hi to Justin in Connecticut.  Justin.  Morning, boys.  Hey, buddy.  Hello, sir.  Yeah.  It's a little known fact that Hitler was Time Magazine's Man of the Year not once, but twice. 
[00:41:00]  Also, the Prince of England monetarily backed Hitler before the war.  Why would he ruin all these great accomplishments that he had?  Well, he kind of was crazy, Opie.  See, that's the point I'm getting at, is there was some thing.  If you look at, did you ever notice this?  We've had some great accomplishments, too.  Of course we have.  So how about you not go crazy today?  But they always talk about the sex for Sam thing, don't they?  See?  They sure do. 
[00:41:30]  That's a perfect example of what I'm trying to say here.  Do you know the Hindenburg that was just invited over to the United States and with great pomp  and circumstance and celebration before it burst into flames was carrying a giant swastika  on one of its tail fins right here to the United States.  Hey, come on over.  We're fine with you.  See?  And then, you know, whoops.  Something's happened.  There's some speculation as to how and why and who. 
[00:42:00]  There might have been a bit of a problem.  Well, they might have had a problem.  But, yes, look at that.  All right.  Let's look at the tail of the that was flying right over Lakehurst, New Jersey, my friends.  Is that the one that burst into flames?  That's the one.  I didn't know it had a swastika on the tail.  Of course.  It was German.  No clue, man.  It was one of the pride of his air fleet.  Nathan in Chicago.  Nathan.  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  What's up, Nathan?  You're on the air.  Hey, long-time listener, boys.  How are you guys doing?  I just want to tell Anthony that he's not wrong. 
[00:42:30]  Basically, a lot of listeners are not listening to what he's saying.  Yes.  What he's saying is we shouldn't celebrate the bad things that Hitler's doing, but what the good things.  That Hitler also took unemployment.  Did you just brainwash half the fucking audience?  You should be a leader, man.  Fuck this radio crap.  You should be a leader.  I didn't say.  You just brainwashed everybody.  No, I wasn't saying celebrate.  The word isn't celebrate.  But they could hear it in your voice. 
[00:43:00]  Observe.  They're all going to.  Remember.  They're all going and getting their party supplies because of you.  Where do you find little pointy party hats with the swastikas on them, by the way?  Because I'll tell you, Party Express does not have it.  They can make a boatload if they have that.  All right.  Well, good for you, Ant.  Yes.  Enjoy your day.  It is just a day to reflect and look back on something that had happened in history that has shaped the way we live today. 
[00:43:30]  It would have been a very, very different United States of America if he hadn't pulled his shenanigans back in the day, as they say.  That's all.  Same thing with Stalin, but I don't know what the fuck his birthday is.  But he was a little more just with his own people, fucking around with them after World War II, and he grabbed up a bunch of countries and everything like that.  And then he pretty much kept his death and destruction within his own borders, occasionally venturing out. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  Hitler, you know, and what am I, I'm being told I could buy an original A. Hitler painting for about 50 grand, about 50 large?  Less than that.  Danny?  Less than that.  Less than 50?  Yeah, there's an auction house in Europe.  They have a whole bunch of original A. Hitler paintings.  Just having an A. Hitler hanging in my house would be something.  You could bid right from their website.  I could bid from the site?  Yeah.  Danny, send me the link. 
[00:44:30]  Oh my God, you're out of your mind.  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  You wouldn't, come on, go.  You're out of your mind.  Timmy, you wouldn't think that it would be kind of something historic to have an Adolf Hitler painting before, this is many years before he became the dictator and the Fuhrer.  He was just a painter.  He took people's luggage and told them they would get it when they got to this family camp.  Meanwhile, they were going through it, planning to gas people. 
[00:45:00]  They were terrible.  I understand where he went.  That kind of wipes out everything he did.  Yeah, that might have been considered good.  It's hard to look at his artistic qualities.  But his paintings are quite striking.  I'm sure John Wayne Gacy had quite a skill with the brush, too.  His clown paintings.  Look at that.  That's good.  It's a scene in City Square, presumably Vienna.  He paints in dreck.  In pastel.  It's very dreckish.  On a card signed by A. Hitler.  It's average at best. 
[00:45:30]  It looks like a worn-out postcard.  If that wasn't fucking signed by a megalomaniac, you'd want no part of it.  Really?  Yeah.  If that was done by fucking A. Hister.  I wouldn't want it.  A. Hister of Schenectady.  You wouldn't spend $30 on it.  I wouldn't want it?  No.  You don't think?  No.  Interesting.  Arnie Hister drew that.  Arnie.  I want something a little bigger in size.  Look at that lopsided fucking-ass Bridgie drew.  It was stunk.  His perspective needed a little help, didn't it? 
[00:46:00]  Terrible.  He'd probably paint.  He'd probably be going really well, and he would just go,  Juice!  His hand would go like to slip off the canvas.  And that guy's way too big.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jim in Atlanta.  Jim.  Yeah.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Jim.  And I got an interesting collectible you might want to seek out.  What do you got?  How about all those finite teeth?  No, I don't.  Look, I-  There was a pause there, though. 
[00:46:30]  You actually paused.  No, I paused out of like, oh, God, what is-  Why?  He, again, another person who hasn't been listening to what I've been saying.  I think it would be very interesting, yeah.  Jim, Anthony does not want that wink-wink, nudge-nudge.  I'll put you on hold.  No!  What?  Don't put him on hold.  Are you sure?  No, and I'm not winking.  Are you sure?  My eye is very dry.  It's allergy season.  Are you-  Are you-  I'm positive.  All right.  I would just like a- 
[00:47:00]  How big is that one?  Did he paint anything big?  What a rushy, rushy guy he was.  How small was that?  How small is that painting?  I don't know.  I'd have to convert it.  It's in millimeters.  It's in millimeters!  Stupid millimeters.  If it's in millimeters and not even centimeters, then there's a problem.  Is millimeters like .62 or no?  That's very small.  I know Benson and Hedges was a silly millimeter longer.  What?  Cigarette commercial from many, many years ago.  Oh, right.  I shouldn't even know. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, this is good.  Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris.  Hey there, Chris.  Hey.  When I met my wife's family for the first time, she's got this nutty uncle.  He took me aside and he said that everything we've got, we owe to Adolf Hitler.  Looked at him kind of weirdly.  He said, got our family out of the coal mines working on the railroads in the war effort.  Steve from Bayshore is saying, good work, Ant.  Nobody's spoken this well about Hitler since Nuremberg 1938.  But he's a racist.  Of course he's going to say good work. 
[00:48:00]  Steve is not a racist.  He is a fan of the era.  He is a fan of the era.  He understands what happened.  And the more you understand about history, good or bad, you must understand history so that you understand where you are now in the flowing river that is history.  You need to know why we are here.  You don't know why we're here unless you understand from whence we came. 
[00:48:30]  And Hitler was a huge part of the 20th century and shaped the world we live in today and will continue shaping it long after the 21st century is done.  Boo!  I'm scared of you.  Boo!  There have been many things that Hitler has given to the world that does not tie in to his genocide. 
[00:49:00]  I nigh.  The advances in avionics and aviation are astounding!  Gay.  Like, um...  Sorry.  Uh, Anthony Jordan from Scranton, PA writes...  No, the sides of my mustache did not just fall off.  He writes, my favorite Hitler painting is Starry Night, So Let's Kill All the Jews.  No, that isn't a painting of his.  This was well before any of those shenanigans.  He also painted Whistler's Mother Went Up the Chimney. 
[00:49:30]  Gotta know Whistler's Mother.  Whistler's Mother.  Hey, uh...  All right.  You want a break?  That was a fun hour.  Well, I want a break.  That was a terrific hour.  That was a lot of fun.  Look, I'm identifying a time and a person in history that...  Jimmy, he said he slept like a baby last night.  Slept like a baby.  Well, I worked out.  He couldn't wait for today.  It's field trip day for Anthony.  No, no.  This is like, uh, you know...  I'm surprised you slept so well after all those cupcakes with candles in them. 
[00:50:00]  That was last year.  I don't want anyone to misunderstand me.  So if you've taken anything out of context, listen to the replay and listen to what I'm saying.  With open ears.  That's all.  Because people mention Adolf Hitler and you get one story.  Which is horrible.  And true.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I am just saying that it has shaped history. 
[00:50:30]  It has shaped who and where we are today.  So you have to, uh, you know, look at this and remember it.  You know, even the Holocaust, uh, uh, survivors and people say never forget.  Never forget.  Well, don't forget that and don't forget everything.  Don't forget the good stuff that he did.  I'm not saying good stuff.  I'm not putting it in that context of good stuff.  I'm saying good, bad, or indifferent, it is where we are right now.  Jimmy, I need your help today.  And some of the things we use on a daily basis are directly...  I try to tell Anthony about all the Jews that run Sirius XM Satellite Radio, 
[00:51:00]  but he's not acknowledging that.  Do you think we'd have satellites?  I'm trying to tell him that our boss's last name is Greenstein.  Do you think we'd have satellites in orbit if it wasn't for our dissection of the German  scientists and the V-2 rocket that, I mean, not the dissection of the scientists, their  information, and the V-2 rockets that Hitler rained down upon England?  Again, these rockets were used to help us with our space program and our missile program  and got those satellites into space. 
[00:51:30]  So perhaps if Hitler wasn't bombing people, they would have used that technology to help  with the space program and we would have gotten there 10 years sooner instead of in  the 60s.  No, no.  We might have gotten there in 1961, instead of 1969.  We as humans are creatures of necessity.  We are creatures of necessity and we do not do things just because, oh, this will make it  more convenient or help us.  We do things when we need to do things.  So that's why our Air Force was completely outdated when Hitler's, by the way, was amazingly 
[00:52:00]  modern when he blitzkrieged his way across Europe and just started attacking.  We had a completely obsolete biplane fucking Air Force and we could have built that up and  made it better, but you know what?  We didn't have to until, hmm, then we started with mono-wing planes and great, and then before  you know it, P-51 Mustang kicking ass all over.  But, before that, ho-hum, yeah, this'll do. 
[00:52:30]  It's also Muhammad's birthday, I'm learning.  What?  Who the fuck is that?  You don't know who Muhammad is?  Ali!  Who?  Hammer down at 63 on Twitter, thank you.  Muhammad?  The Muhammad.  Wait a minute.  You mean the Muslim Muhammad?  The Prophet Muhammad.  I don't acknowledge him!  I acknowledge Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior.  Thank you very much.  Oh my God, he's out of his fucking mind.  I know.  I'm sure Christ is thrilled to hear that you love him and Hitler today.  I didn't say I love Hitler! 
[00:53:00]  Let's go to...  I can't get my point to call.  Wait, we got a phone call coming in from Hungary.  Who's this?  Yeah, this is Vlad the Impaler.  I just wanted to thank Anthony for sticking up for some of the people who don't get a fair shake over history.  Vlad the Impaler.  Very good.  Thank you, Vlad.  Let's say hi to Eric in Virginia.  Eric.  When's Genghis Khan's birthday?  Hey, Anthony.  Yes.  Hey, Anthony.  I got an original A-Hitler painting of a Vienna countryside that's in my basement. 
[00:53:30]  My wife's great-grandpa was in the Nazi party, last name of Kuhlenschmitt.  And I got uniforms and medals and everything else from that era.  And I think we should have let him do what he needed to do to get rid of all the Jews and the niggers.  Oh, my God.  See, that's where it goes to.  Is this a friend of yours?  No, absolutely not.  This is a guy...  Is this a friend of yours, Eric?  ...that has taken what I'm saying and is twisting it around to try to make it seem like I am saying that was a good thing. 
[00:54:00]  No.  No.  Bad.  Bad.  Bad you.  Bad you.  Bad you.  Bad you.  No.  That is not what I'm saying.  My God, do people get confused.  You try to walk a fine line with information and you get crucified.  Lead us to the promised land.  Shut up.  I'm not talking to you.  Away with this man.  Away with him. 
[00:54:30]  My God.  All right.  Okay, terrific.  We're going to take our first break, but first, remember this.  Out in my heart, I still love you. 
[00:55:00]  Remember that?  Well, Coke Logic sent in a little something using that cry.  I don't know how he heard this in that, but very good job by Coke Logic.  Check this out.  But above all this, I wish you love.  I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how he heard this in that, but I don't know how 
[00:55:30]  Oh boy, I'm a Nazi. 
[00:56:00]  Oh boy, I'm a Nazi.  Oh boy, oh boy, I'm a Nazi. 
[00:56:30]  Oh boy, I'm a Nazi.  The Opie and Anthony Show on the Virus Series XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show on the Virus Series XM. 
[00:57:00]  All righty, this is a new segment on this show where I've invited some well-known celebrities  to sit around and talk about the interesting things happening in the world.  This is J-Chat.  Let's get it started, let's get it started, yeah. 
[00:57:30]  Let's get it started, let's get it started.  That's it, meet tonight's panel.  A good friend who contributed to the show, Adam Carolla.  Adam Carolla's here.  The columnist of the Daily Beast, please welcome Megan McCain.  Thank you.  Very funny comedian, I'm here on the most popular show on XM Radio, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Please welcome Jim Norton.  All right.  Opie, Opie.  There is Jim Norton.  We just played the Jay Leno intro. 
[00:58:00]  Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie.  It's a tough one.  It's a really weird verbal thing because there's something about the, there's certain words  that are hard to say in a row and there's something about, if it was Opie and Pete, it would probably  be very easy.  The Opie and Pete show.  But your mind starts gearing up for the next sound like that.  It's like the Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, it does it.  I've done it before and I know how to say the name.  How many million people just heard, well, heard last night Jay Leno say that?  Probably, I'm going to guess between five and six. 
[00:58:30]  Why don't you march down that fucking hallway and tell those guys to pay you?  That is some serious advertising right there for the Opie and Anthony show.  I would like to do that.  You should.  I would like to demand it.  I love how one-sided it is around here.  How about you acknowledge what the fucking Jimmy does for you?  Holy shit.  Fucking major marketing for the platform and our radio show.  How was Jay, man?  It was good?  He asked for you guys.  Yeah, he was, he's really, he seems very happy and, you know, Brooke wasn't very nice 
[00:59:00]  because I did a fair revenge with her so we chatted a bit.  She's very sexy.  Brooke Shields, of course.  She's really nice.  She's a really nice.  Brooke Shields.  It's like, yeah, it's like, I'm walking, my self-esteem is so low.  No.  I know.  It's hard to believe why would I?  I went away a man and I came back a lady with tits.  Fucking piggy in the minibar I was.  How were you?  I was a toffee ball eating piggy in the minibar.  Such deliciousness in there.  You enjoyed some treats, did you?  Dude, I was fucking, I'm almost embarrassed with how much I ate yesterday on Sunday. 
[00:59:30]  Actually, I got in Sunday and I went out, I just, I fucking ate when I got there.  I was walking around and I ate lunch and then at night I was just eating fucking like pizza,  like those like pretzel bread.  Did you have the famous Amos cookies that are always in there?  On the plane?  No.  There was, uh, no, there was none in the minibar.  In the minibar.  Every hotel I stay in, the minibar has always got the little bag of famous Amos cookies.  No.  Oh, are they just delicious?  But I did have, I ordered a shrimp cocktail and then I did dip the pretzel bread in the  cocktail sauce and, and in the mayonnaise that had the horseradish in it. 
[01:00:00]  Thinner.  I was doing, yeah.  Thinner.  I put a curse on you, I never take it off.  You're going to die with pretzel bread in your mouth.  In your mouth.  So I would just dip, dip and then eat.  And I forget what I was doing.  I was looking at pornography or something.  Wow, what a scene.  I went to bed, I was, like my body was itching because I was just fucking, just, just  stuffing up too much salt.  Just stuffing shit in your face with porno in your undies probably.  Yeah, couldn't get to sleep, I was all anxious, I was writing, I was all eager. 
[01:00:30]  What's the number one food that tastes delicious but makes you feel like shit almost immediately?  I got mine.  I think I got mine, I've said it before.  I got mine.  Makes you feel like shit immediately.  Immediately, you're right.  You're right.  Mine's potato chips.  I fucking love potato chips.  But as soon as you eat a whole bag, I mean, you can't have just a few, but if you eat a  fine helping of, what's yours, Jimmy?  Jesus.  What's yours?  Baby Pussy.  Oh shit. 
[01:01:00]  What?  Between Hitler and Baby Pussy, this is going to be our last show, you assholes.  It wouldn't make you feel bad.  We mean physically, not so much mentally.  I don't know, potato chips are a rough one, but I would say...  You just feel the fucking grease and salt as soon as you eat them.  Although chicken wings is a close second.  Buffalo wings at the cellar, man.  Buffalo wings.  But I only eat a couple.  Colin will order like a double order, like a 24.  I need the whole thing?  Or 12.  Maybe 12.  And I'll have like two or three, and I eat all his chips. 
[01:01:30]  I'd say chocolate.  Chocolate for me.  Chocolate?  Doesn't make me feel like shit after I eat it.  Oh, immediately.  Really?  Yeah.  What about you, Ant?  Mine is if I eat an entire Cinnabon.  Baby Pussy.  Holy shit.  I know, right?  What the fuck?  Just some funny words.  You didn't say Baby Pussy on Leno's show last night.  I would love to.  I said BP.  They knew what I meant.  What, Ant?  Yeah, an entire Cinnabon.  Cinnabon?  Like, if you eat the whole fucking thing, they smell like heaven, and like, they're so fucking 
[01:02:00]  flavorfully delicious, but if you eat the whole thing, it just sits in you, like you  just fucking ate concrete, and it's very sweet and rich, but if you just have like a couple  of pieces, and you have the willpower to throw it away, that's fantastic.  It's hard to be able to convince, like some foods, like pretzels aren't as bad for me,  even though they know they're shitty, I can convince myself.  Pretzels aren't that bad.  But I mean, compared to like everything else, compared to other stuff, they're not.  A lot worse. 
[01:02:30]  But stuff like chocolate, I can't convince myself there was any good reason to eat it.  Fucking greasy potato chips.  I love greasy potato chips.  With a little fucking sour cream fucking dip.  What's better than that?  Baby Pussy.  Chips and salsa, too, are just one of those.  You just can't stop.  I cannot stop eating that shit.  You ever had blue chips?  Blue chips?  Fucking rule, man.  They're all right.  Come on, Chip Blue.  They give you the blue chips.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They give them out.  They said blue chips.  I thought I was going to get lucky. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, Chip, that's actually pretty clever.  Of course it is.  By the way, I hate to break it to you guys, but Chip has a big fan.  Oh?  You know, what do you think, Chip?  Oh, no.  He's obsessed with Chip.  Colin?  Obsessed with Chip.  That seems like something Colin would love.  Yes.  I think it's safe to say, Colin worships the ground Chip walks on.  Colin was supposed to be in today, but he can't do it.  Yeah, he had something to say.  He's coming in next week.  He'll be in next week.  There's something pressing. 
[01:03:30]  You know, my stomach and my sweater.  I don't know.  What do you know?  Colin rules.  Oh, fuck.  Sorry.  Sorry.  My Tweedly-Doo horn on your newspaper.  Let's do some shit, man.  Yes.  That's what we do on a daily basis.  Shit.  That's right.  So that movie Kick-Ass ends up being the number one weekend movie after Final Tally.  Remember, we were discussing that yesterday.  So they adjusted the numbers and everyone's going and seeing Kick-Ass. 
[01:04:00]  We killed that movie like three, four months ago.  Oh, when Bob Kelly came in.  When Bob Kelly brought it to our attention.  He was the one that actually said, wow, I saw a trailer for a movie.  Check this out.  It's great.  We searched for it.  He didn't even really know the name of it.  And then we watched the trailer and we're like, that looks like shit.  You're insane, Bob.  And then it does well.  And then it did kind of grow on me after a couple of weeks.  Dude, I saw that because on Red Eye they covered that and kind of like, is it appropriate  because the little girl says cunt?  Yeah.  Whatever.  And, you know, Greg didn't care, but of course I think the woman on it was like, well, I  don't know. 
[01:04:30]  But I loved it when I saw the trailer.  I'm like, the kid was with Nicolas Cage and she's like, yeah, you cunt.  Yeah, yeah.  You're doing karate kicks and violence.  I'm just fucking with you, daddy.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like, that shit's great.  I just loved it.  It's funny.  I think I'm going to go see that today.  I would love to see that.  Check it out.  Yeah, let's go watch Kick-Ass.  I'm too tired.  And I got to mention that Travis's Habitats.  No, the Habs or the Habitants.  Oh, the Habitants.  Habitants.  The Habitants.  What's stupid.  The Habitants lost to D-Boys Capitals last night. 
[01:05:00]  And by that, you mean the Canadians.  Right?  Ew.  See, everybody knows them as the Montreal Canadiens.  If you watch hockey, you know that they're the Habs.  They're not the Habs.  Shut up.  Everyone knows.  Look, if I look at the fucking paper and I look at the stats, will it say the Canadians?  No, yes.  Or will it say the Habs?  You know what, though?  It's not nice that they're known as the Habs-nots.  It's not nice they're known as the Canadians, knowing that there's a bunch of other Canadian teams in the NHL there, Travis.  It's spelled differently. 
[01:05:30]  That's what makes it different?  It's the Canadi-ans.  Oh, the Canadi-ans?  The Canadi-ans.  What's the difference between that and the Canadians?  There's an E instead of an A.  No, but what does that mean, though?  We're better.  Oh, really?  Not last night, huh?  No.  What happened to the Habs?  Ovechkin kicked your ass.  Oh, boy.  What's the series at right now?  2-1 Caps.  Caps, right?  Oh, shit.  You know who's going to be happy about that?  D-Boy.  D-Boy.  D-Boy gets a check in the plus column.  And, aw, Trap Dog, a check in the minus column for the day. 
[01:06:00]  It's just Travis.  It's fine.  Trap Dog.  Trap Dog turned me on to that great fucking app yesterday.  Thank you so much.  The second I got the fucking, I guess it became available, Trap Dog goes, hey, A-Dog, there's  a, he says there's an app for Fios, a Fios DVR app that I can now just run through the  program schedule for, like, so far in advance.  I just hit it, and I could start recording, ow, through the intertubes. 
[01:06:30]  That's pretty fucked up right there.  It's fantastic, so I downloaded that right away.  Wonderful.  Thank you, Trap Dog.  Did they find the new iPhone?  What's that about?  Oh, my God.  What a fucking, what a, what a thing of intrigue and kind of fucking secret agent shit this  is.  What the fuck is this about?  That got stupid.  Well, apparently.  But is this real?  People are saying 90% sure this is real.  10% think it could be some type of hoax or something even done by Apple to throw people  off.  I'm guessing this.  Or to test market without actually test marketing. 
[01:07:00]  I'm, I'm guessing that Apple's in on this somehow.  Here's the story.  They're not stupid.  They're not this stupid.  Gizmodo, the website Gizmodo.  Right.  Comes up with the fucking next generation iPhone.  Like, freaking out.  People are like, where, where, where, where, where the hell would you get this?  When you say next generation, when will it be out for the, the people?  Uh, is there a release date?  It's usually June.  Yeah, it is usually like midsummer or something, beginning midsummer.  A couple months away.  Uh, yeah.  So, uh, they come up with the pictures and, and everything of this, uh, phone. 
[01:07:30]  And, uh, it looks like it would be the next generation iPhone.  It doesn't have the slightly curved back.  It's more squared off, and that, they say, is to fit the bigger battery and more electronics  that it needs inside to do all of its, uh, little new tricks that it can do.  Um, it's got a front and back camera.  Uh, it's got a flash on the camera.  Not flash.  Uh, don't get it.  Not Adobe flash.  Don't get all excited.  And, um, it's like, it's got aluminum around the outside edges. 
[01:08:00]  Just has a different look to it a little bit.  And a lot of neat new gadgets, but, uh...  It looks bigger.  You said that, right?  It does.  It looks a little fatter.  A little fatter.  Um, but actually, if you put each one flat on the table, it's not.  It just, the old one curves toward the edges on the back.  Okay.  Uh, this one doesn't.  I think I read it's only like three grams heavier.  Yeah, three grams heavier.  Uh, well, apparently, this is how Gizmodo got it.  They paid upwards of, I believe, $10,000, was it, for this? 
[01:08:30]  Um, after it was found.  In a bar.  The, uh, one of the gentlemen, these, uh, people that work for Apple, apparently, an engineer,  had one of these, because they do test these out before they just put them on the market.  Sure.  You have to test them in the real world.  Uh, and apparently left it at the bar.  Jesus.  And it was found by somebody who then identified it as, uh, the next generation iPhone.  It had a case on it to make it look like an old school iPhone.  But, uh, that came off. 
[01:09:00]  People looked at it and said, holy shit, this is the next generation.  Gizmodo got a hold of it and just took it apart, looked inside.  It had all Apple, um, electronics in it.  Is that guy fired, do you think?  Dude.  So fired.  That is.  Unless he's in on it.  Unless he's in on it, right.  Unless Apple's in on it somehow.  But, dude, this is one of these 90% this guy just fucked up.  But what a way to create.  And this got out.  How do you know?  How would you leave that in a bar?  Come on, dude.  Dude, how would you leave something like that in a bar?  You would be guarding that thing.  I bet you Apple's in on this. 
[01:09:30]  They might be.  That's what I'm saying.  A new way to create a buzz.  We're talking about it.  Everybody's talking about it today.  And it's almost test marketing because you look at it, you get a lot of details on some  of the features and the look of it, and now they can get feedback from people  before it comes out without actually having to release it.  Now, what's the new stuff on it?  This is not the software update.  This is actually a new version.  Yeah, you're going to get the new software is coming out, but also a new phone is going  to be coming out.  If you look at it, you'll see it's a little thicker. 
[01:10:00]  It doesn't have that tapered back.  Aluminum around the outside.  Aluminum buttons.  A front and rear camera so you can take pictures while you're looking at the screen.  Is this Groundhog Day?  Didn't I just hear this?  Yeah.  You're saying it all over again?  I'll say the Hitler stuff again if you want.  No, no.  iPhone, iPhone.  It's not that much different, apparently.  Well, it's got a bigger battery.  So battery life.  I'm sorry, go ahead.  Oh, no, go ahead.  You, please.  The resolution on the screen is supposed to be ridiculously better. 
[01:10:30]  It's just showing Apple's desperation, let's be honest with each other here.  And with the multitasking, there's a lot of iPhone killers about to hit the market.  Oh, please.  This is what Apple had to do.  They get attention back on themselves.  A lot of desperation here, Anthony.  With the multitasking now with the apps, you're able to multitask.  It's going to, they say the way they've done it, it's not going to take up as much battery  power, but they've put a bigger battery in this thing.  Now, can you multitask on the iPad?  Yeah.  When they.  You'll be able to.  You'll be able to with the update.  Yeah.  Why don't they just make it that way to begin with? 
[01:11:00]  Because.  Pete's sake.  Why not?  You can also use it as a Frisbee.  Exactly.  Who's a shit about the iPad?  I do.  I'd love.  I would love to think of shit on someone's iPad.  Yeah.  Oh, would that be good?  We're talking viral video.  Just.  We're talking viral video.  We have.  Hold on.  We have Cherry Darts and the prizes are iPads.  Right.  When is Cherry Darts?  April 27th.  We need couples from Cherry Darts.  A week from today.  Yes.  To come in here and reenact this great contest we had. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, it's fabulous.  Which was a sensation.  Is there a way to get the other cities involved too?  Like with the contestants we have?  That would mean flying somebody in.  I don't think so.  I don't know.  But I mean like through the.  I mean if they wanted to take a road trip.  No, no, no.  Through the phone.  I mean the way we did last time.  Is there a way to do it?  Remember last time we got.  Oh, I don't know.  We got to figure that out day of the event.  We'll figure something out.  We should do.  We'll figure out some kind of.  Yeah.  That's not a bad idea.  We need couples.  I think you get people on the phones and the couples are playing for them type of thing. 
[01:12:00]  Maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe we can buy it.  You know what?  I didn't do it.  I'm with Aaron Piper from Illinois.  It's viral marketing.  And he's calling you guys a bunch of rubes for buying into it.  Look, I said 90% real.  What bar was it?  The bar.  What bar was it?  I have no idea.  What bar was it?  Yes.  It was the genius bar.  That would be silly.  If you have one of the only new generations of the iPhone.  Really?  But you don't have one of the only.  Like he was one guy that fucked up.  There's plenty of people out there. 
[01:12:30]  How many though you think?  Not a lot.  There's not a lot out there is what I'm saying.  But behind three or four.  Who would find it in a bar and know what it is?  Yeah.  You're going to guard the shit out of it.  You're going to guard the shit out of it.  Who would find it and know, hey, this is the new one.  Let's give it to Gizmodo.  They're saying that it could very well be what you're saying.  All right.  So the guy leaves the phone behind and then what happens to the phone?  Who picks it up and how does it get to Gizmodo?  Jimmy's right.  Too many coincidences.  Yeah.  Who picks it up?  Coincidences.  There's a whole story about it right now.  I run a site called Homodo.  Sorry if you're not here. 
[01:13:00]  No, it's Gizmodo.  Gizmodo.  I thought it was...  Someone left a load on a bar stool and I licked it.  But I couldn't get it with one tongue swipe, so my tongue went through it and it looked  like mashed potatoes after a fork had gone through.  But what are the odds?  Dude, it's impossible.  What are the fucking odds that whoever finds this phone knows, holy shit, they got something  valuable in their hands.  And then it goes from there to Gizmodo? 
[01:13:30]  Come on.  Gizmodo's probably not a tune to wait for them to get the exclusive without saying we got  the phone.  But the thing about viral marketing is that Apple is not known for that.  They don't do that.  All right.  But maybe they're trying something new.  There's something that doesn't make sense here.  It could be possible, but yeah, something doesn't add up.  It's either a complete...  All right.  Explain to me.  Let's go through the steps.  The phone is lost in what bar, first of all?  What city?  Danny, you got the story?  Yeah.  Okay.  And then how is it...  Here's the guy, by the way. 
[01:14:00]  They have a picture.  That's the guy that had it.  They show him bleary-eyed with a pint bottle of Jack Daniels in his hand.  What?  Is that a picture from the night?  No.  I wouldn't think.  Maybe it is.  So why they got a picture of him all bleary-eyed?  That's Gizmodo's picture.  And how did they get that?  I might have found it on his Facebook or something.  Oh.  All right.  But he does work for Apple.  Yes, Danny.  It was called the Gourmet Hausstatt.  And where's that?  Ah.  It's a nice place to enjoy good German ales.  Ah.  You know what? 
[01:14:30]  Speaking of Germany.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Where was it, Danny?  Where is it?  Hang on.  What city?  Well, probably, I'm assuming San Francisco somewhere.  I am.  Considering that's where Apple is.  That's where they're at, right.  Okay.  So it's probably a hip place in San Francisco.  Maybe they let Gizmodo know, hey, you might want to...  Fell out of another man's asshole.  You might want to be at this bar tonight because something might be left behind.  Yeah.  I don't think Gizmodo picked it up.  Redwood City, California.  All right. 
[01:15:00]  So he's there.  He's hanging out.  He's got the...  He's a software engineer for Apple working on the iPhone, some iPhone software.  Mm-hmm.  And on the night of March 18th, he was enjoying some fine ale.  Yeah.  And he left his prototype phone on a bar stool, leaving it to go home.  Maybe he had it in his pocket.  He got up.  It fell out of his pocket on the bar stool.  No.  No.  It's going to...  I'm betting some kind of viral marketing.  And then how did it get picked up?  It says, what, lost and found? 
[01:15:30]  Go back a little bit.  Apple security...  No, no, no.  The person who eventually ended up with the lost iPhone was sitting next to Powell.  He was drinking with a friend, too.  Um, he noticed Powell on the stool next to him, but didn't think twice about him at the  time.  Not until Powell had already left the bar and a, uh, random, really drunk guy who'd been  sitting on the other side of Powell returned from the bathroom to his own stool. 
[01:16:00]  At the random, really drunk guy pointed at the iPhone sitting on the stool, the precious  prototype left by, uh, the Apple engineer.  Hey, man, is that your iPhone?  Asked the random, really drunk guy.  Hmm, what?  Replied the person, uh, who ended up with the iPhone.  No, no, it isn't mine.  Ooh.  I guess it's the friends, then.  Oh, your friends.  Returning, uh, friend, blah, blah, blah.  Let's just go to the random, drunk guy.  You don't want to lose it. 
[01:16:30]  So I guess this guy, uh, the guy picked it up?  His friend picked it up?  Is that what I'm getting at?  Well, the person, it says that the person who ended up with the phone asked around, but  nobody claimed it.  He played what seemed like a normal iPhone.  I thought it was just an iPhone 3GS, he told me in a telephone interview.  It just looked like one.  I tried the camera, but it crashed three times.  The iPhone didn't seem to have any special features, just two barcodes stuck on the back.  Uh, next to the volume keys, there was another sticker. 
[01:17:00]  It said iPhone, SWE, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Apart from that, just six pages of applications.  Uh, one of them was Facebook.  And there on the Facebook screen was the Apple engineer.  Gray Powell.  Think about returning the phone the next day.  He left, woke up, a hazy night, blah, blah, blah.  When does he find out it's a fucking iPhone?  The iPhone, uh, the next generation. 
[01:17:30]  Where's that part?  God, this is like he reached for the iPhone.  Who wrote this?  It's a really long fucking story here.  I think he finally took it out of the case and noticed that the case was specially made.  To make it look like an old iPhone.  Yeah, and that it was a completely different thing.  And so then he called Gizmodo?  Gizmodo?  Yeah.  And he got in touch with Gizmodo.  Come on.  Come on.  This sounds like...  Stop already.  Excuse my language.  This sounds like balderdash.  Stop.  I was going to say bunk.  John in Albany.  John.  Hey.  So we're supposed to believe that Apple just lost the newest version of the iPhone and they're not sending cease and desist and went straight over to get it? 
[01:18:00]  They did send a letter, yes.  They did.  They did send a letter that they want it back.  It's their property.  They immediately wiped the phone when it was missing.  When the guy said it was missing, they wiped it so it wouldn't show any screen except for...  The connect to iTunes screen.  The connect, yeah.  Like, you cannot connect.  They can wipe it from there?  Yeah.  Let's go to Ray in Dallas.  Ray.  Okay.  Oh, you doesn't have to call him Ray. 
[01:18:30]  You can call him Ray.  Ray.  Oh, we lost Ray.  That guy good.  He had some tech talk on that.  You didn't like that guy?  He just doesn't have to call me Johnson.  He was funny.  Oh, he was.  Just a scream.  What a hoot.  Morgan in Philly.  Morgan?  Antonio.  Gregorio.  Hey, Gini.  Hi.  Not too long ago, Nine Inch Nails actually did the same kind of marketing.  They were leaving some drive in the bathrooms of the shows with, you know, supposedly unreleased tracks from the new album on them. 
[01:19:00]  That's a good idea.  So they haplessly walk into the shitter.  I think they found something that was left by, you know, a stagehand or something, and that's how they leaked some tracks and got some buzz.  I actually did the same thing with my new CD, but I took it, I threw it down, I put it in my garbage can in my apartment, and then I threw it away, and somebody will find it someday.  Jesus.  This is a dump.  Yes.  All right, Morgan, thank you. 
[01:19:30]  Here's a very good question from Nelsie.  Nelsie in Florida.  Hey, you can call.  That doesn't work.  No.  Nelsie.  Hello.  You're on the air.  Nelsie.  What's your name, brother?  Florida.  Hello?  Hi.  Talk.  What's your name?  Sorry about that.  I'm from Alabama.  I'm from Florida.  Okay.  Well, whatever.  What do you got?  Yeah.  Isn't the iPhone supposed to be locked when you get it?  I mean, all new phones, you can lock them, right?  Yeah, but this guy apparently hadn't done anything. 
[01:20:00]  They wiped it.  So you're telling me you have a prototype phone, and you don't even have the common knowledge to just lock it, so just in case you happen to lose it?  Yeah, that's true, too.  What are you thinking, Ed?  He didn't lock it.  You're a smart guy.  I'm saying it's some kind of marketing.  I'm saying that Apple's in on it somehow, some way.  The more I hear from the common man, the more I'm thinking maybe they did this on purpose.  I'm starting to think that things kind of aren't fitting together.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Joe in Jersey.  Joe. 
[01:20:30]  Yo, ONA.  What up, man?  Hey, man.  Hey, yo.  It's so fake, man.  That bit that I'm talking about, it ends with, please let me know where to pick up the unit.  Sign the Apple VP.  It's like Craigslist or something.  Seriously.  Yeah.  So fake.  It's like WWE.  Is that what we're looking at here?  Yeah.  Fake and phony.  I think so.  Here it says.  You want to blow that up?  It has come to our attention that Gizmodo is currently in possession of a device that belongs to Apple. 
[01:21:00]  This letter constitutes a formal request that you return the device to Apple.  Please let me know where to pick up the unit.  Sincerely, Bruce Sewell, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Apple Inc.  But, yeah, please let me know where to pick up the unit.  Like, he's going to show up?  Well, maybe where it can be picked up.  Why don't you just mail it to him?  Could be a legitimate letter.  Because the letter doesn't matter anymore because they already did what they wanted to do with this marketing, this viral marketing. 
[01:21:30]  Right?  That letter dated yesterday.  Yesterday?  Yesterday.  It's just odd, though.  It's like, does Apple really need, like, I don't think they need to go this route to promote.  I mean, everybody's talking about the new iPhone anyway.  Like, why would you need to draw more attention?  I mean, people are already talking about it.  That is true.  What would be the point of planting this in a bar, hoping that some tech-savvy kid picks it up, you know, notices that the case is a little funny.  Maybe he's in on it.  Yeah, there's too many.  Maybe the kid's in on it, though, that picked it up. 
[01:22:00]  There's something.  Yeah.  Like, they didn't even take a chance, maybe.  Maybe the kid that picked it up is in on it.  Right.  And everyone's in on it.  But for what motive?  What's the motive?  Just to get people talking.  Get people talking about it.  Maybe some chatter.  Maybe to try something different.  To look at message boards and say, like, all right, I saw the new one.  I don't like the way this looks.  I don't like this.  And maybe they could change some features.  Sure, but why not just do it in traditional Apple fashion and just hold one of their dumb press conference?  Maybe they decide to just do something a little different.  I'm going with fake.  Simple as that.  I mean, time will tell. 
[01:22:30]  And then someone in this room could go, I told you so.  I say it looks real to me.  No, it's real.  We have Gizmodo on the phone.  Hello.  Hello.  It's Gizmodo.  Stupid Steve.  Would most people know that they got a newer version of the iPhone if they saw this thing?  What are the odds?  I think if you have an iPhone, you would know.  Right.  So you've got to make sure.  You might.  So the person that finds it has to have an iPhone to realize, holy shit, this is a special iPhone. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  And to be able to navigate through the apps and find Facebook and not having to put in your, I don't know.  I don't know.  It does seem a little fishky.  But stranger things have happened, right?  Right, guys?  Let's go to Ray.  Ray in Dallas.  Ray.  Boo!  You can call him Ray.  I don't hear that now.  My phone crapped out last time.  No one cares.  We can tell it was just not fake because Engage Net or Gizmodo got a hold of it, and they were playing around with it. 
[01:23:30]  They got to see it start off, and then after, when they were about to start videotaping everything, it remote wiped, and they couldn't restart it.  And you could see that you could move the battery out and everything else.  It looks like they're going to let you take the battery out now.  Oh, wait.  I think he's right.  But Danny's saying no?  No.  They took the whole thing apart, so the battery was, obviously the battery is internally included.  It looked like the cover was removable.  Right.  No, the battery's not removable.  You can remove the cover of this phone, of the iPhone right now. 
[01:24:00]  The battery isn't going to be removable.  They don't do that.  No, you're right, sir.  They opened it up.  They breached the outer shell.  Are they going to do it?  Oh, you could call him stupid.  Oh, you could call him moron.  Oh, you could call him idiot.  But you doesn't have to call him retarded.  Let's go to Luke in Boston.  One more call, and we'll move on.  Luke.  Luke.  Luke.  Luke.  Look up this morning, gentlemen. 
[01:24:30]  Hey, there's no way that this is fake.  This is a total marketing master for Apple.  I mean, look at it.  The first time that you're introduced to this phone, it's not Steve Jobs holding up next  to his shiny, stupid face with a giant screen behind him.  You're seeing some doughy Asian guy take it apart and tell you what's new and what's different.  It's cold.  It's classless.  It's a marketing disaster.  You know something?  This guy makes a very valid point.  Steve Jobs is the guy that likes to present these things in this bigger-than-life kind 
[01:25:00]  of way.  That's how he's presented every Apple product is with PowerPoint things and films and other  people coming up talking about features.  So they're going to release the biggest thing that they've had is the iPhone, and they're  going to release it by having some, yeah, puffy-faced Asian guy rip it apart like a fucking  piece of shit.  This is how Apple throws everyone off it.  Really?  Now you're thinking it's real?  Now I'm 100% real.  100% real?  I am so fucking waffly.  I flip-flop.  Well, that guy isn't those Steve Jobs. 
[01:25:30]  Well, you got to get the regular Joe.  You know what?  This is the dude from Lost.  Yeah.  It's Miles.  It's Miles from Lost is taking it apart.  I found this in Faraday's asshole.  Along with the scripts for this fucking year.  Whose iPhone is it?  It's Pennies.  Is it?  Shut up.  Joe in Charleston.  Joe?  Hey, guys.  The biggest problem I have with this story is this giant hole in everything that they're  doing.  The software they use to remotely wipe it can also turn on the GPS and pinpoint within 
[01:26:00]  feet where the phone is.  So they could have just tracked it and showed up at the guy's house.  Oh!  Fake!  What are you thinking now?  Totally fake now.  Why wouldn't they use the GPS on it?  Now you're thinking fake?  They would know exactly where it was at any given moment.  Be able to just send over fucking attorneys.  Send over attorneys?  Give me my fucking...  Send over the black van.  The leg breakers?  The Apple fucking...  Oh, yeah.  The black van with the Apple logo on it. 
[01:26:30]  That Asian guy's going to be in a black van if this was fucking real.  Oh, that's it.  You know something?  You're right.  I guess it's to play devil's advocate, I suppose.  That would only...  Yeah!  That's right.  I have a phone.  Don't make a call.  They dropped the iPhone in my wig.  Let's drive two to my feet.  Make myself a little taller.  Yes, Danny.  I guess they'd only be able to track it if the phone was on.  So if once they got it, they turned it off, now you can't track it. 
[01:27:00]  Ah, fake!  Or real?  Which one does that make it?  If it was on to remotely wipe it, they could have tracked it before they wiped it.  Yeah, if they...  All right.  Look around it like that.  Oh, that's a good one.  So is it fake or real, Ant, this whole thing?  What, my hair?  What are you going with that?  Now you're going with fake?  I'm going with it's real.  Still real?  Okay, let's go to that.  Still real because of the Steve Jobs thing and his presentations are very, very consistent  and very clean and very Apple. 
[01:27:30]  Maybe his cancer's acting up.  Maybe his fucking cancer's fucking piping up a little.  And they're not sure if old Stevie boy is not going to be having a fucking something done.  Plus, you know, I mean, Gizmodo is a really reputable tech site and for this to come out  as being a phony, I mean, it would really hurt their credibility, I think.  And, you know, things like this happen all the time, like, is this the real thing?  Is this the real thing?  And usually they won't commit to it if they have any doubts, but they are completely  talented to this as this is the next iPhone. 
[01:28:00]  And I don't think they would put it out like that if they weren't 100% sure.  So maybe somebody made a call like this.  Maybe somebody said, look, we leave the phone.  You want to pick it up?  Who knows?  And they would say, yes, it's better for them to get it.  Let's go to Alan in California.  Alan?  My impression.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Who Gizmodo is going to put on the website that they spent 10 grand for stolen property  and think they're just not going to get prosecuted?  Come on.  Maybe it's not stolen property if it was found, if it was lost. 
[01:28:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You can't just, you can't say, oh, look, I found a car on the street.  Find his keepers, lose his weepers rule, though.  Sell it.  Maybe.  No.  If you know it's not yours, if you know you didn't pay for it, it's stolen property.  This guy's right.  Fucking fake.  I'm saying fake now.  Back to fake?  I'm saying fake.  I've always said fake, Opie.  What are you talking about?  Let me go to Jesse Ventura on line six.  Jesse.  Oh, no.  The phone was painted with thermite paint. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, it was?  Yes.  Everyone, you guys don't realize this?  You don't see it right there in front of you.  It had thermite paint on it.  We weren't Navy SEALs, so how do we know?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, fuck Jimmy, too.  Let's go to Mike in Babylon.  Mike?  Mike?  Mike works for Apple.  But I actually work for Apple, and I know some people that work out in the headquarters.  And when they have the iPad, they couldn't even leave their house with it. 
[01:29:30]  It had to be, like, locked inside their house.  What do you do for Apple, by the way?  What color shirt do you wear?  What color little iPhone tag do you have around your neck?  Ah, shit, bird.  What do you do for Apple, Mike?  Which store do you work at?  I actually do training and stuff like that.  Training for what?  The people that buy the computer?  Are you the person that sits there and goes, now I'm going to show you Photoshop?  Yes, in a way.  Ah, you just work at the store. 
[01:30:00]  Could you get the ladder and get me the case?  Yeah.  Do you have a case for the 17-inch laptop, please?  Yeah, could you go in the back and get it for me?  We thought you worked in software development.  Yeah, go and get me one.  As you know all the ins and outs of everything that happens at Apple HQ.  Exactly.  This guy, I think he knows fucking Steve Jobs' shitting habits. 
[01:30:30]  And meanwhile, I have more pull at the fucking Apple than you do.  All right.  Well, he's the guy that cleans the fucking, he polishes the big Apple in the window.  Exactly.  You're a fucking window polisher and I despise you.  I'd be like Stalker Patty knowing exactly what's happening at Starbucks board meetings.  Oh, well, they're fighting.  Star and Bucks have been arguing.  Have they really?  Fake or real, Jimmy?  Fake.  Jimmy's saying fake.  I'll tell you why.  I think Apple is too tight a company to allow something of this magnitude. 
[01:31:00]  This is not a software update.  This is the new phone.  There's no fucking way they would let some drunken asshole take it into a fucking bar.  Hey.  Come on.  Yeah, but phones are always tested.  Oh, you would know.  Go ahead.  Yeah, it's common knowledge.  Phones are always tested months in advance out in the wild.  By drunks and bars.  Yeah, that's true.  So this guy, his job is to develop the software that allows the phone to make calls. 
[01:31:30]  There's probably a new iPhone somewhere in New York right now.  No way.  As there is in California.  Well, man, no one will know it's there even after they're fucking.  Because they have to make sure that the phones work.  That's obviously like a prototype with the design.  They're not going to make it like that.  They're going to have the rounded edges still.  You think?  I don't know.  Yes.  They could do it like that.  You think they're going to go with that look?  I think it's probably way too close to a release date to make any major changes.  Especially shape of the goddamn thing.  Will it stand on its own like that or no?  I mean, it looks like it would. 
[01:32:00]  I mean, it's pretty flat.  Maybe that's for the video cam.  Maybe they're trying to compete with Flip Cam then.  Because Flip Cam is fucking standing on their own.  Oh, so you're standing on the side.  Where's this?  Watch this.  Bing.  It falls over.  Well, I don't know if it would stand up like that.  No, you would know.  I think it would.  It looks like it would stand up on its own.  There's the on and off.  The internal components, they were made specifically to fit that chassis.  Yes.  Hey, guys.  We got Robert Kelly on the line.  He knows a little something about iPhones.  Oh, wow.  Robert Kelly.  Dude, you got your prototype off the phone. 
[01:32:30]  You lay it on the bar still.  Bam.  You go to the bathroom.  You come back.  Bam.  It's gone.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  You know what, dude?  Steve Jobs.  You know what, dude?  He's too smarmy.  Smarmy.  Steve Jobs.  Oh, he doesn't like the new design.  Look at the new design, Bob.  Look at the new.  Fuck you, O.P.  What is he going to see it coming? 
[01:33:00]  That's what I want to know.  I know.  Every fucking time.  Like a dumb dog.  Who doesn't love that retard?  Like a stupid dog.  He comes back for the same fucking prank every time.  You know what, dude?  Just mowed on it.  So smarmy.  You know what, dude?  Yeah, look at their website over there.  Oh, my God.  Danny put a prolapse anus up on it.  Oh, it's not the iPhone.  It's a prolapse to ask.  Look.  Oh, shit. 
[01:33:30]  Are these jizz phones?  Jizz phones, everyone.  Hey, we got Jeremy and Charlotte.  He's a very, very, very big fan, an uber fan of the iPhone.  Let's see what he has to say today.  Jeremy, who isn't?  I want to thank you for what you do to your iPhone.  It's still real to me, damn it.  All right.  And it's still, he thinks it's real, apparently.  Yes, he does.  I heard, by the way, I heard that the guy that lost this was some black guy that used to be homeless. 
[01:34:00]  He was very sad, too.  And Steve Jobs was trying to tell him that it's okay because he still cares for him.  Right.  They actually had a microphone in the office when this guy came in and apologized for losing it.  And then Steve Jobs, out of the kindness of his heart, actually told this guy in his own way that it was okay.  And the guy reacted a little emotionally.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:34:30]  He's got the goddamn disc in the player already.  How did he act?  Very emotionally.  In what way?  Well, he just, I think, you can't really describe it.  What?  You kind of got to hear it.  But Steve Jobs tells him not to worry and that he still cares for this guy.  You do impressions.  How did it sound?  I'd rather just play the tape.  Play what?  The tape of the guy.  What guy?  And Steve Jobs.  And Steve Jobs?  Yeah.  I think I did.  That was in my heart.  Thanks.  Steve Jobs.  I still love you. 
[01:35:00]  And the tech.  Yeah, the drunk guy.  Yeah.  That guy is fucking fantastic. 
[01:35:30]  All right.  Well, we'll have to get more info and we'll find out if it was fake or real.  I'm sure this story will keep going.  Because this whole thing will fall apart either way.  Yeah, you think?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:36:00]  No one can keep a secret.  It's ridiculous.  And what if the iPhone comes out and it's completely different than that?  It just looks completely different.  I feel pretty stupid.  Yeah.  And maybe this is to really throw people off.  And they got a whole new fucking thing they're going after.  A whole new design.  Yeah.  That you can't even imagine.  So they're like, you know what?  Throw this fucking prototype out there.  Yeah.  This is the stupid guy's prototype.  For the iPhone killers.  This is the guy that we just fired for stupid prototype.  And we'll throw it out there.  Do they fire the guy? 
[01:36:30]  I would assume that guy will not be working.  Well, then there would be a press release, right?  No, not necessarily.  Oh, really?  But if the guy's fired, he's not going to speak up and say, I got fired from my plunder?  Maybe they gave him a little fucking comp package to shut his mouth.  And he's probably got a confidentiality thing in his contract.  That he can't even tell people he got fired?  I would assume the confidentiality thing in Apple, anyone that works at Apple, has got to be ironclad.  It sounds very fishy.  It does sound fishy.  Not even Monique's brother can't keep his trap shut anymore. 
[01:37:00]  Dude, don't you think Monique should be apologizing to the brother?  Oh, yeah.  I Twittered that.  Oh, you did?  This morning, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  I didn't want you to think I stole it from you.  Huh?  I didn't want you to think I stole it from you.  Because if you saw my Twitter, my God.  I didn't read your Twitter this morning.  But I was thinking exactly that.  Like, why would Monique's brother admit he molested her?  I mean, yeah.  Oof.  And Oprah won't take the fucking test.  Yeah, we'll get into some of that stuff after the break.  Oprah's pissed off.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  But I don't know why. 
[01:37:30]  Who?  Well, we'll tell you after the break.  It's nice.  It's a tease for me, and I'm here.  Do you remember Rich Voss was in, and he was talking fucking tech shit?  Oh, my God.  Danny took his ramblings and made a tech call out of it.  I got to play this.  This is perfect for this break.  I just want to preface this by saying, because it's so good that people might get confused.  This wasn't Voss and Danny going into a studio and making something and having fun.  Every part you hear from Rich Voss in this fake call to tech support is actually Rich talking on the show about his computer and various tech-related shit. 
[01:38:00]  It's so good, it almost wrecks the bit.  Yeah, exactly.  It's so good, you would think it's like...  You're convinced that this is a conversation that Danny and Rich Voss had.  Should Derek and I go back and make it shittier?  No, I get shittier.  To get the bit across better.  I just really want to let people know this was Rich.  Because a lot of people think that you were really giving him advice.  This is actually Rich.  Babbling on our show and then Danny said, you know what, I'm going to turn this into a tech call. 
[01:38:30]  So check it out on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Good morning.  Thanks for calling Radio Shack.  My name is Danny.  How can I help you?  I used to have the thing on my TV where you can download shit from, you know, like through, you know, the air satellite.  Like Wi-Fi?  Wi-Fi, whatever.  Here's the thing.  But, I mean, that's not working now because...  This is Radio Shack.  Do you need, like, an AC adapter?  Maybe get somebody to come over and fix it.  Well, I mean, we really...  This is Radio Shack, you know, so we don't really do that.  We sell products. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, I see.  Well, I mean, I'm not supposed to do this, but, like, I mean, did you get into your router settings and take a look in there?  Okay, so it's right here.  So what are you saying?  Like, just look into your router settings.  Okay, so I log in.  I find this shit right there.  Yeah, exactly right.  So get in there and then, you know, make sure that your Wi-Fi is enabled.  But where do you fucking wire it into?  Well, I mean, it should just be wired right from your cable modem.  It should just be right in there.  Yeah.  Why?  How do you know that?  Because that's just how it works.  Are you talking about the hot, the heavy, thick wire you're talking about? 
[01:39:30]  You mean like a Cat5?  You're talking about a...  You know, Ethernet cable?  Yeah, they call them, I think they call them hot wires.  Fire wire?  Fire wire.  Dude, do you need, like, a universal AC adapter or a soldering iron?  What's that?  Dude, I just, let me just get back to work, man.  Like, can you open a browser and get to the web?  So it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Yeah, yeah, it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Are you on the web?  Okay, so now...  Can you go to a website?  Can you do that?  You hook it up, okay?  Are you listening?  Are you listening to me?  Can you open a browser and go to your homepage? 
[01:40:00]  Is it that easy?  Yes!  Click.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, I see it.  Jeez.  Bingo.  We have a winner.  Is that it?  Is that it for good?  Am I set for life?  Yeah, yeah, that's it, dude.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  Thank you for helping me with this.  Yeah, man, no problem, dude.  There were some other tech questions I needed.  Oh, oh, Facebook.  No, no, no, no.  No, no!  I'm up to my limit of friends.  No!  If you want a cordless phone or some LEDs, fine.  I'm up to my limit of friends.  I'm not helping you.  I think somebody set up a fan page.  I'm hanging out!  How do I get people to go there instead of sending me friend requests? 
[01:40:30]  Good song.  Yeah, pretty much it.  Let's wait for the vocals to kick in.  Oh, that's right.  They won't.  By the way, I love Ozzy's new song.  Yeah?  I never like, I always take a while to like a new Ozzy song because I'm so obsessed with  what I already like.  Like, new shit for me is really hard.  And I heard the new one on the plane last night because it had fucking Wi-Fi. 
[01:41:00]  It's just rules.  Who's playing it?  It's on the net.  Because it's going to be released on CSI.  It's called I Want to Hear You Scream.  I fucking love it.  It just sounds different.  Well, we got to check that out.  We got that in the system there, Travis.  Probably not yet.  It's only a play of rough copy.  But I really like it.  I'm happy I like it.  If I didn't like it, I wouldn't bash it, but it's nice to say.  You got it, Travis?  I'm looking.  Hang on.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  By the way, Ed, the Beezid spot we just read?  Yeah, this guy's right.  Bees don't hum. 
[01:41:30]  They buzz.  So you should buzz over to beesid.com.  Let me think.  Hmm.  Bzz.  That was the worst thing you found about that read?  By the way.  Jesus.  Who wrote that?  I like your lead TV, by the way.  Thank you.  That's pretty heavy.  I'm good that way.  When I was a kid, I used to think that buzz off was like a really cool insult.  I would always say it to my parents.  I was mad.  I would go, buzz off. 
[01:42:00]  Wow.  Man.  Do you still use it?  I really thought that was a rough one, though.  Like I was getting, like being really rebellious, but saying buzz off.  What would your family say?  Oh, my God.  Would they just be like, shut up?  I don't remember.  They wouldn't even acknowledge you.  They'd probably just go in and make honey.  They did.  Travis played the Aussie there because Sharon Osbourne, you heard about this, right, Jimmy?  Yes.  She's removing her breast implants this summer, and she's going to give them to Aussie to use as paperweights.  Why?  She's probably being sarcastic. 
[01:42:30]  Why is she doing that?  But why is she removing them?  I'm guessing that...  That part, I'm sure, is real.  She's probably...  I mean, how old is she?  She's probably close to 60, and she's probably just sick of them.  Yeah, but the problem is when you take them out, then you're going to have, like, fucking just...  Well, do they shrink your tits, or do they put...  Oh, my God.  It's got to leave them.  I think it's a big procedure where they've got to put shit back in there.  Right.  So where are they going to get the shit from?  I don't know.  Maybe they get it from your ass.  You can't just take the implants out, I'm thinking.  No.  Don't they put pig stuff in there or something?  Maybe some...  I think they put some animal fat in there. 
[01:43:00]  Or some ass fat or something?  No, because that would take a lot of ass fat.  I think they use some kind of animal.  Didn't we talk about this with someone recently?  Yeah, who was it?  But it was probably some BIM.  We didn't give a shit.  I think they do put some pig fat in your ass or something.  From your ass or...  And we don't have the new Aussie song?  No, I haven't.  Oh, you do have it?  Yeah, you want it?  Yeah, let's take a listen to this.  Let's hear a little new Aussie.  It takes a minute to get rolling.  What's the name of this?  I want to make you scream.  This is a Let Me Hear You Scream.  Oh, let me hear you scream.  Actually, it rocks right from the beginning, though.  Let me hear you scream. 
[01:43:30]  His voice sounds a little different in it, but I like it.  I'm black and bruised, beat up, but still I take the applause.  Cause all I need is blood and sweat.  I like that.  Ticka, ticka, ticka, ticka, ticka.  That's good.  Yeah, it's heavy. 
[01:44:00]  Then we go into 80s mode.  With a chant.  This is different than a lot of stuff he's done, though, man.  I like this. 
[01:44:30]  I don't think it's that bad.  It's pretty good.  Wow.  It's fucking 61.  Aussie 61?  Oh, 60, yeah, man.  Man.  Damn.  Yeah, I was surprised how much I liked that beat.  Only because, again, new stuff always takes me fucking, it's always a chore to get me  to like anything new musically.  It's really tough to like anything the first time you hear it, right?  The worst. 
[01:45:00]  Isn't it cool when you hear a song for the first time and go, God damn, that song rocks.  Not often, though.  It's so rare.  It usually takes a couple spins.  It's untypical of him.  He's got a new guitarist and sometimes that kind of just...  Who's playing?  Fuck, man.  Gus G?  Yeah.  Thank you, Blue Heeler.  Gus G?  Because that sounds pretty good.  Where's Gus G from?  I don't know.  He's young.  I met him briefly.  I saw him know he's young.  I don't know where he's from, but I like him a lot.  I like that.  Friggin' chuk-a-chuk-a-chuk-a-chuk.  Yeah, it's fucking...  Because Zach is great, but, you know, after a while, all those years with the same guy, 
[01:45:30]  it just, you know, it starts to like...  Zach's stuff, I kind of...  I was glad Ozzie moved on.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  No disrespect to Zach, but that many years with the same guy, it was starting to sound similar.  Yeah, sometimes I got a shig-a-dip, shig-a-dip, shig-a-dip.  Who the fuck is Gus G, though?  Now, Blue Heeler, you've got to give me more info than that.  I don't know, but I like him a lot.  I love the band he has.  He was just a young band.  Yeah.  All right, I got another song to play for everybody.  Ooh!  Totally commented, but cannot be commented.  Oh, no. 
[01:46:00]  Opie's on the radio, untwisted and commented.  Some will be amused, some will be amused.  Some will be offended by the language that he used, but Opie is undone.  Opie's on WPAP.  Oh, no, no, no.  Opie's on WPAP.  Hi, B-A-B, who's this?  Totally psychotic, but natural neurotic.  Exotic and erotic, idiotically chaotic. 
[01:46:30]  Some will be amused, some will be all right.  Some will be offended, but they listen every night.  Cause Opie's on WPAP.  Opie's on WPAP.  Sorry, this is 7-11.  No, I can't help you.  Opie's on WPAP.  See ya!  Does your teeth hurt, Jimmy?  Jimmy, you won't even look at me. 
[01:47:00]  Jimmy, you all right?  I want to go home.  You all right?  I want to go home.  Are you all right?  Why don't you explain, Opie, what we just heard?  Well, that was my theme song.  That started the nighttime attitude.  No, I don't.  Every night.  No way.  He's like, no, no, I don't.  Hey, man, if you're going to have the nighttime attitude, you've got to start it off with a bang.  And that was the theme song for the show.  Right.  I do believe I had a contest where local bands came up with the theme song for the nighttime attitude. 
[01:47:30]  There was one line in there where it was like, he's saccadic and neurotic.  It was like trying to catch all the traits.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  City.  That was a man singing, by the way.  What?  No, it wasn't.  No.  Sounds like a black woman.  Pretty sure it was a man.  Not a man.  I think it's not a man.  No.  No.  It's not a man.  All right.  That's not a man.  That was a local band.  We need, um, brought you by the makers of the Fudgy Wudgie Bars. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, the people are coming forward.  Yep.  Homo.  Um, you know, it was a, it was a time, Opie.  It was, uh, it was, uh, it was the time it was.  That was about 93.  93.  Wow.  93.  Yeah.  That's a long fucking time, huh? 
[01:48:30]  Wow.  That, uh, totally demented.  Cannot be.  That was the line.  Being totally demented and can't what?  I don't know.  Cannot be prevented.  From what?  Being demented.  Yeah.  I would assume.  Well, couldn't you be prevented from doing it?  They couldn't hold me back.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I was crazy.  Because Opie's on WBAB.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Totally demented, but cannot be prevented.  Yeah.  Opie's on the radio.  I'm twisted and tormented.  Twisted and tormented.  See, I am twisted and I'm tormented. 
[01:49:00]  All right.  So that works.  Give him that.  I'm demented and it can't be prevented.  Couldn't they prevent it by just turning off the fucking power?  Well, it could be prevented if you want to be literal Opie.  Right.  I believe it could have been.  People want to know what's with the alarm clock if it was the nighttime attitude.  Well, I secretly wanted Bob Buckman's slut.  Oof.  Yeah.  Oof.  I don't know.  I guess you wake up to listen to nighttime radio. 
[01:49:30]  Oof.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hearing that song makes me wish his fender was dented.  I couldn't think of a better car action than one.  Let's go to Footer.  Footer!  Wow.  Hey, man.  Oh, my fucking, my T-cell count is dropping by the second that I listen to that.  That is the gayest thing ever, Oof.  Brings back memories, right?  I can't even say that we all had to start somewhere because I think at that point I was already in some type of radio for 10 years. 
[01:50:00]  That's what I was going to say.  It's B-A-B days, Oof.  So, I mean, that was your fucking, that's when you got your fucking, that was when you were big already.  Wow.  Punch it out.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, let's say hi to Scott in Jersey.  Scott.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Welcome aboard.  Hey, I almost crashed my car on purpose into a bunch of school children.  On purpose.  Why?  Because it's so catchy and you were tapping along to it?  No, it's because I would never want those kids growing up hearing anything like that. 
[01:50:30]  No, it was catchy.  It was catchy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was very catchy.  Right.  It was, uh, well thought out.  That's the word for it.  Oof.  One word for it.  It's catchy.  Like AIDS.  Totally.  What's wrong?  I gotta email Brooke.  Fuck.  Oh, yeah?  Brooke Shields?  Yeah.  Why are you gonna email her?  Just we're friends.  Yeah?  Bye, Mick.  What do you mean you're friends? 
[01:51:00]  Just buddies.  Are you guys gonna get together the next time she's in New York?  I know where she does yoga.  Maybe to hang out.  You gonna hang out with her?  Sure, I'd love to.  Really?  Brooke?  Hmm?  What kind of small talk did you have with her?  We talked about the, uh...  So glad we moved on from that.  About the, uh, movie and stuff.  About Fairy Vengeance.  And, you know, she was just...  We talked about QWERTY.  She's a big QWERTY player.  Yeah?  It's like Boggle.  We talked about Patrice.  She likes Patrice a lot.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Not in that way, right?  Good.  No. 
[01:51:30]  No.  She's married.  Oh, she's married, right?  Yeah.  Married woman, are you, Brooke?  Yeah.  But what'd you talk about?  Anything?  Just the movie.  We talked about, like, ten minutes in the dressing room.  Is the movie gonna be good?  I have no idea.  I haven't seen it.  The premiere was Sunday, and nobody told me.  I think the trailers have been out there for a while.  No.  Nobody invited me.  Why wouldn't they invite you?  Oh, my God.  It wasn't...  Well, it was her fault.  Probably the production company, because I'm in New York.  It probably is completely her fault.  She said, no, keep him away.  Yeah, because she saw me.  She's like, were you there last night?  I was like, no.  I was alone in my room.  Oh. 
[01:52:00]  Tugging my wiener.  Tugging your wiener and eating.  All I did was, I was shoving...  I didn't...  I was like, nah, I was tired.  I didn't say I was eating toffee balls while tugging my wiener.  Because that's what I was doing.  Who's toffee?  I'm sorry, coffee.  The guy from the Green Mile.  I had a big pair of black balls in my face.  Coffee.  Only spelled different.  Put my balls in your mouth.  Exactly.  Booyah.  Dead kids.  Only spelled with a K and a Z.  Because I'm an idiot. 
[01:52:30]  Yes, that was Pat Benatar doing my theme song, by the way.  All right.  Do you have a fucking theme song done by Pat Benatar yet?  I can't say I do.  Tom in Colorado.  Tom.  Hey there, Tom.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Opie.  It's not my birthday.  Wow.  Some people think it's my birthday today, for some reason.  Oh, it's Hitler's.  It's Hitler's birthday.  Can you guys play your old intro, the one that you played back when you started in New  York City after you left Boston?  I think that was your best one.  Did you have one?  How did it go?  I don't even know. 
[01:53:00]  Did we have an intro?  Something about you loving New York City and all that.  What?  What the fuck are you talking about?  Oh, come on.  You have.  It's an old one.  Did we have a theme song?  Really?  I swear to God, I don't remember this.  Did we play it every day before we went on?  Yeah.  It said, I love New York City.  It said something like the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow.  It was a good one.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  Even though New York sucks because I'm from Boston.  Dude, I remember.  I hear your accent.  Shut up.  I remember most of these things and no recollection that we had a theme song when we moved back 
[01:53:30]  to New York from Boston.  Get a few wins under your belt and then you can fucking talk shit.  Yankees suck.  Yeah.  They sure do suck.  Ooh.  750%.  Ooh.  They suck.  Where are you guys, by the way?  Ooh.  Where are you?  We're in the south.  Where are you?  Yeah.  No shit.  Shut up.  Ooh.  Three weeks into the season.  Shut it.  I could care less.  We're off to a good start.  You're not.  Yeah.  And what about your football teams and basketball teams?  Ooh.  I don't give a shit about them.  Don't care.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Don't forget.  How about you have a football team and don't share it with the entire fucking Northeast, dummy? 
[01:54:00]  Oh, that's going to hurt too.  You don't even have a football team, so shut up.  You share it with Vermont.  Oh, please.  Vermont has other Patriots.  Fucking Vermont.  New Hampshire owns them.  Maine owns them.  Connecticut owns them.  Shut your mouth.  New England.  That's vague.  Oh, come on, man.  You New England Patriots.  Where are they from?  I don't know.  No borders here.  You don't like their vague football team? 
[01:54:30]  Oh, my God.  Not a big fan?  No.  It's like fucking...  It's a fucking borderless place.  Yeah.  Anthony.  We have two football teams.  Three, if you can.  Tell them about your hockey team there, sir.  Tell them about your hockey team.  What about the B's?  Well, you know what?  Hope, I hate to say it.  I stopped being a Bruins fan a long time ago when their new ownership there bought it.  Because now all they care about is making money off concessions.  Well, that's what every fucking team is doing. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Every now and then, but I mean, at least 15 years ago, they fielded a real team.  They should lose money, man.  Yeah.  How do you think they pay for good players to have a good team, dummy?  No, but they don't have good players.  Concessions and ticket prices and everything else.  Yeah.  They suck as bad as the New York hockey teams.  I don't give you that.  I don't know.  You guys are in the playoffs, and I don't see another team in the playoffs.  Hey, why don't I include the three states?  You're up two games to one against the Sabres right now.  How about we include the three states around fucking New York, like you do with New England,  and I'll just include the fucking devils in there. 
[01:55:30]  How about we do that?  Why don't you include Vermont, too, since you touch them more than Massachusetts does?  Shut up!  Wait, is that true?  Am I right or am I wrong?  Wait, do we know our geography?  We do have a little border there, but it's...  I think we have a little taste of it.  I don't think we have a...  Do we have a big taste of Vermont?  Massachusetts doesn't touch it at all.  Who fucking cares?  Wait a minute.  Just give me a fucking map.  So you guys can carry the gays after, you know, Massachusetts does carry it.  Look, it's your fucking state, New England. 
[01:56:00]  It's part of New England.  It's not part of New York, so I don't care what they fucking border on.  Give me a taste of this.  And Mass touches it a little bit.  Oh, shit, that's right.  The whole fucking right side of New York hits Vermont.  Mass touches it a little bit.  And Mass does touch it a little bit.  It does, too.  Why?  That just fucked Anthony, didn't it?  And we don't touch it at all.  There's a river.  Nah, we touch it a little bit.  There's a river!  We touch it on the bottom part a little bit there.  That's right.  You touch it a little bit.  You know what?  I didn't even realize that until just now.  I forgot that we border Vermont a little bit. 
[01:56:30]  I hate you.  That's that part of New York that we don't really know much about.  What?  What's the last thing to come out of Connecticut?  The Hartford Whalers?  The Hartford Whalers?  Well, it's all yours.  New England, my friend.  Have fun with it.  A lot of people enjoyed the Hartford Whalers when they were around.  New England Patriots.  When they were around.  New England Patriots, dummy.  Not Boston Patriots.  New England Patriots.  Share it with all the rubes.  Have fun.  Anthony?  Yes, sir?  Just because you're a New Yorker, I still love you.  How do you fuck with me on Hitler's birthday like this? 
[01:57:00]  How?  How is it?  How is it?  Thank you.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Who's Green Day's big song?  They're on the fucking...  They're doing Broadway now.  They have a few.  Green Day had...  Oh, my God.  I like a cover they did of Working Class Hero.  Yeah, they did all right with that.  What else?  What is a big song?  I don't know any of their songs.  That's Danny.  He loves Green Day nowadays.  You like them?  Nah, well, I used to.  Back when they played, like, Isis of music.  Time of Your Life was their big fucking hit.  Oh, the time of your life.  That's them.  Well, even before that, they got big with, like, their album Dookie. 
[01:57:30]  They had, like, Welcome to Paradise.  And, uh...  Welcome to Paradise!  How's that go?  Welcome to Paradise!  It sounds like his nose is clogged in most of the songs off Dookie, but still, Dookie  was a huge fucking album for Green Day.  Give us a little Welcome to Paradise.  American Idiot's bigger, right?  That's a good question.  Is American Idiot bigger?  Did it sell more copies than Dookie?  I have to take a look.  Listen to this, Jimmy. 
[01:58:00]  I like this song.  Here comes the big one.  Me and 50 million other people. 
[01:58:30]  What's another big one?  Oh, for this album, Longview is huge.  That's probably one that's most recognizable.  That's a good piece of Longview.  Longview is an AF song.  Jesus.  Which one do you want?  Longview.  On the only station that really rocks.  What the fuck?  Really?  This is big.  That's what we're bragging about?  There's 15 rock stations in Boston, but we're the only station that really rocks.  Green Day on... 
[01:59:00]  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Mike from Neptune goes, was Jimmy alive in the 90s?  No.  This Green Day on Broadway thing.  You tell that punk I was busy.  You got a hard one?  I do.  Oh, God, Jimmy.  Put that away.  Why else would he stand up, man?  Jesus.  It's content.  Green Day on Broadway.  Danny, you know anything about it?  I've seen the commercials, and it looks really deuce chilly to me. 
[01:59:30]  It looks very deuce chilly, and I'm wondering why the band didn't completely commit and just  say, you know what?  Let's hang out on Broadway and do this right with us instead of people playing us.  And I'm wondering if maybe they're going to sneak in and do a little something on Broadway.  They're not going to do anything?  This is the fad thing that's happening now.  You take bands...  Yeah, the fad thing.  Because Jersey Boys made such a big hit.  What songs did they do?  Well, that was the fucking thing with...  What's his name?  Who?  Who's the head guy from...  Frankie?  Yeah, yeah.  Frankie Sinatra? 
[02:00:00]  Frankie Valli.  Oh, Frankie Valli.  Yeah.  And that's for a certain age group.  And then they did it with another band.  And now they're figuring they could get a younger demo in by doing a Broadway show featuring  the music of Green Day and then throwing it to Wacky Dancing and Storyline.  They figured out how to get a cover band on Broadway.  Thank you.  Yes, yes.  That's all it is.  There's a U2 one coming out, and I'm very proud to see my brother on Broadway.  I'm a big U2 fan.  I'm a big U2 fan.  Is there really a Broadway thing happening with U2?  No.  Oh, because...  But I wouldn't doubt it. 
[02:00:30]  Because I'm a huge U2 fan?  Fuck that.  I wouldn't see that either.  Yeah.  I want to see fucking U2.  I want to see Green Day on Broadway.  I don't want to see fucking fake Green Day on Broadway.  Is Billy Joel doing my life, or is it my life?  Oh, yeah.  They did a Billy Joel thing, too, right?  Did they do a dress?  Something about a dress?  Let's say hi to Ryan in Oregon.  Mike, Mike, Mike.  Ryan!  Yes.  I was just going to say that Green Day lost me when they got all political and went anti-Bush.  Them and Noah Bex were starting an anti-Bush tour. 
[02:01:00]  It's rare in music.  In the conspiracy theory.  I was going to say, isn't it a hoot when your favorite band goes fucking political?  Yeah.  Because, like, shut the fuck up and play the songs I like.  That's why I hated U2 with Bono always fucking giving his nose and everything.  I have a rough...  I have a tough time with that.  He's calmed down, though, thank God.  A little bit.  Yeah.  It's starting to affect him a bit.  Yeah.  Because I liked the first two Green Day albums, and it was all about...  I guess even the third one, too.  Even Dookie.  You know, it was a lot...  It was mostly about, like, you know, banging chicks and how come I can't have the girl that I want  to be with.  And then all of a sudden, it's just, like, you know, down with the administration and 
[02:01:30]  everybody's robots.  It's like, what happened?  Like, what...  Yeah.  Go back to talking about trying to bang chicks.  What did I miss?  Because that's when your music was pretty good.  Yeah, what did I miss?  This is all, by the way, just a copy of Beatlemania.  If you remember, at the Winter Garden Theater.  Beatlemania, they would have guys that look like the Beatles playing fucking Beatles songs.  How old are you?  That was pretty much it.  Beatlemania?  What's wrong with you?  That was before Cats was Now and Forever at the Winter Garden.  So that was a long goddamn time ago.  Now and Forever, and it's gone.  And it's gone, and now Mamma Mia's there, I think. 
[02:02:00]  Mamma Mia using Abba's songs.  So yeah, it's got a Rockland.  It's a trend, but I don't know.  Unless Abba's ever winds up on Broadway, I'm fucking hanging myself in front of the theater.  That would be great.  Yes.  Oh my God.  He's an Iron Man, a man of iron.  And they bring out an Iron Man, he comes out, hello, I'm Iron Man.  No, it's a guy with fucking shirts and an ironing board.  With the Iron Man.  They try to be ironic, and it just stinks.  Oh my God.  You see the trailer for Iron Man?  I did not. 
[02:02:30]  Generals gathered in the masses.  Just like witches and black masses.  They've ruined the songs.  They just...  Dude, you haven't seen the Iron Man trailer, and they're using the riff from Iron Man?  Oh, are they?  No.  Holy...  You've seen the trailer, right?  No, I haven't.  I haven't seen the trailer for that.  I saw a teaser a long time ago.  Mickey Rourke looks fucking amazing in this fucking movie.  Really?  Was he playing Jupiter?  Did you see the first Iron Man?  Yeah, I liked it a lot. 
[02:03:00]  I loved it.  Don Cheadle's in this one, I said, because what's his name?  Terrence Howard priced himself out of the market.  Did he?  Are you kidding me?  How do you fuck yourself in a movie like that?  He's an Oscar winner.  What a dummy, though.  What a dummy.  Iron Man is a great franchise.  I'm saying that's probably...  Maybe he didn't want to do it.  Fucking...  The trailer's awesome.  Are you saying he was a certain kind of rich and decided he wouldn't...  He was a certain type of wealthy and would not sign on for this?  All right, I think you do.  What's the trailer?  Can I hear it?  I haven't seen it.  Nah, it's long.  Oh, it's long.  Okay.  It's very visual. 
[02:03:30]  Is that the one where I think where Iron Man, like, his suit doesn't work?  So he goes into a Crousers in New Jersey and applies for a job, and they say, can you  make the coffee?  No.  How great would that be if that's what Iron Man did, if he just worked in his clunky boots  in Crousers in New Jersey?  Crousers.  And he would only fly in the back to get the milk.  You know how mad people would be?  Oh, so angry.  Overbudgeted.  Dookie.  Dookie made.  Hold on. 
[02:04:00]  We're going to get our answer.  Don Cheadle's good.  Dookie.  It's great.  15 million copies of Dookie sold.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that was a big one.  American Idiot?  That was a big one for him.  13 million.  I say American Idiot, I'm going to say was more.  I would say more.  I'm going to say American Idiot more than Dookie from Green Bay.  Yes, I'm going to say more.  You're wrong.  All right, we're going to find out.  I want to count album by album.  Oh, come on.  What's the number?  Oh, my God.  Uh-oh.  Look at that.  What?  Who?  You don't even know where it is. 
[02:04:30]  Six times Platt.  Come on.  Was that six times Platinum I saw in American Idiot?  Hang on.  That's perhaps a lot of records.  I think it would turn a girl on if every time you touched your dick it made this noise.  It does.  She's crinkly.  It would be so hard to jerk off while she's sleeping.  I hear you.  Shh.  Quiet.  I'm jerking off.  I'm very tired.  Get along. 
[02:05:00]  My dick crinkles.  I'm so sleepy.  Let's go to Jim in Philly.  Jim.  Yeah.  Yo.  What's up, buddy?  Yeah.  Um, just the Edge from U2 is involved in the Spider-Man musical.  In the which one?  Spider-Man?  Spider-Man musical.  Yeah.  What the fuck is that?  Spider-Man.  Spider-Man.  Friendly neighborhood.  Spider-Man.  Yeah.  Spins a web.  Your Terrence Howard info was wrong, by the way. 
[02:05:30]  What?  Did not price himself out of the movie.  There was no clear explanation of why he's not in the film.  Rumors say the producers wanted Cheadle all along for the role.  Oh.  Terrence Howard priced himself out.  I remember when it happened.  He wanted too much money.  No.  They wouldn't kick him out in the middle of the fucking, uh...  No.  Sorry, you're out.  You're out.  Let's go to Terrence.  Terrence.  Terrence.  That can help.  Still working on the American Idiot thing.  I just don't feel like adding up all the worldwide sales. 
[02:06:00]  It's under 15 million.  It is under?  Dookie was bigger, huh?  Damn.  But Dookie's been around longer, too, which helps, right?  Sure, man.  That album was like, I think, 94.  Continues to sell since 94?  Did the first one?  I think so.  Holy shit.  One was more commercially successful.  Terry in Erie, Pennsylvania.  Terry.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, is that band that did Opie's song, did they get the rights to pump it up for  Elvis Garcello?  How do you even know that, sir?  Well, you got the pump it up, uh, the pump it up? 
[02:06:30]  What do you listen to him, sing it?  Yeah, it might be the same fucking riff as Pump It Up by Elvis Costello.  Is this too inside now?  Probably.  Oh, fuck it.  Totally romantic, but cannot be creative.  You hear Pump It Up in there?  I hope not for Pump It Up's sake.  Some will be offended by the language that he used, but Opie is under you.  La, la, la. 
[02:07:00]  You got to pump it up?  Elvis is offended.  Elvis is offended.  I think, uh, well, I think there's a similarity there.  Definitely.  I think.  There is definitely a similarity.  Uh, we're near, we're near, we're near, we're near.  What's going on with Oprah?  She's, she's, she fucking is, uh, trashing Kitty Kelly.  She's finally come out and said that it's all hogwash.  Oprah is trashing Kitty Kelly. 
[02:07:30]  Well, she, she actually, uh, there's that rumor that this old guy now is saying he's  her father, and, uh, Oprah says she will not take a test.  I don't know if she wants to know.  Why would she?  She knows who her father is.  Why would she?  No, she doesn't.  She does not know.  You don't think she knows?  No.  She's got to have a pretty good idea.  She probably does.  If some of these guys are coming out and saying they're Oprah's father, she, she has a pretty  good idea which one looks like her.  This might be some guy who just fucking doinked her mom.  Jerked off in the truck next door. 
[02:08:00]  Who knows?  Before we, I know we've already moved on, so it's hard to say before.  We got to go back in time to the, uh, Ops on WBAB song.  No, we don't have to go back.  Uh, yeah.  No.  I got to read this.  Please don't.  It's, um, now who wrote this?  The guy that, um, put it up on YouTube?  The one that says, I accidentally, it says 1993.  That's what I said, right?  I said 93.  I accidentally stumbled upon this just now.  Uh, that's what 3am net surfing gets you.  A guy named Paul Del Aquila? 
[02:08:30]  Paul Del Aquila made this, and apparently it was a hit.  Paul also composed a jingle for shock jock disc jockey, Opie, of the XM satellite radio show  Opie and Anthony.  Del Aquila jingle, uh, uh, titled Opie's on WBAB was used daily by the nationally syndicated  disc jockey.  And when he was broadcasting from the Long Island radio station, uh, uh, performer was  Another Color.  That was the name of the band.  Remember Another Color?  I think it sounds like a black woman.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Another Color. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Uh, Bill Spurl engineered recording location, audio recording technology institute.  So I guess they were students.  In New York, 1993.  Who was the chick that said that?  Uh, I don't know.  Let's see if you can find Another Color on, um.  Why do we care?  Who cares?  I want to see what band put this together.  I can picture her.  I can picture the black girl saying this.  You think it's a chick?  I do.  It's not a guy.  Put in Another Color.  God damn.  Long Island band.  Damn, I was young once.  Something like that.  God damn was I young once. 
[02:09:30]  Weren't we all so, such kids.  Another Color band.  Why do we care?  We, no, we do.  Why?  I want to know who did this.  I want to know who sang it.  I want to see pictures.  They're gone.  Were they gone before the internets?  Oh, wow.  They were gone before the intratubes.  Oh, that sucks for them.  Eh, someone will find some information on it.  So, uh, Oprah.  Ofra.  Won't take a test.  No, um, I don't know why.  Maybe she's just, she was really annoyed that. 
[02:10:00]  She can't be mad people are asking her.  But she's lived her whole life not caring who her father is.  So why?  She's got to do it for us?  No, no, but I mean, don't get mad at the reporters for asking her.  Because she makes her living asking tough questions and kind of getting into people's fucking  darned at her fingernails.  Come on, Oprah.  You can't be mad if people want to know.  She doesn't have to take the test, though.  She doesn't care.  She doesn't care.  And she has the right to go, no, I don't give a shit.  But she should be able to deal with someone asking a tough question.  Yeah, I mean, come on.  I agree with you on that.  She's not used to being on the receiving end of that.  I agree.  You know? 
[02:10:30]  But yeah, she's probably very annoyed at this book.  What, um...  I bought it.  Why would she be annoyed?  You bought it?  I did, yeah.  I should have just got it on my Kindle.  No, I'm actually reading fucking Greg Gutfeld's book, which comes out soon.  And it is fucking...  Honestly, it's...  And you got a copy ahead of time?  I do.  Fuck, I want to read that.  It's great.  Yeah?  Good one.  It's fucking great.  Jordan says, you won't be able to find another color in Ant's house.  That's for sure.  Oh, well...  Apparently, they're, um... 
[02:11:00]  And by the way, Ant, your football rant was terrific, but we don't even have a football  team in New York.  You do know that, right?  Both our teams, like, play in Jersey.  I don't care where they fucking play.  It's the name.  Look, the fucking Patriots don't play in Boston either.  They play in Massachusetts, which is the same state.  Well, we do have a New York football team.  You know what?  How about it's called the Buffalo Bills?  How about it's called the New York Giants and called the New York Jets?  As a matter of fact, the Giants have an NY on their fucking helmet.  They don't have an NJ on their fucking helmet.  Then why play in Jersey? 
[02:11:30]  That's spreading the wealth, just like fucking the Patriots do.  Not just like the Patriots, no.  They're called New York.  It includes all of Jersey because they play in the Meadowlands, which is New York.  They're called New York.  It's sort of a similar thing.  No, it's completely opposite.  I say.  I say.  They should have put the stadium in New York somewhere then.  I say.  Who's that?  Is that the chick that sang it?  Yeah, it seems to be.  Another color.  Wow.  Jesus.  White chick.  Look at this thing, man.  How did she not look bad still?  Unless that's an old photo.  That's from 97.  Oh, that picture's from 97. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, there could be a world of hurt going down.  You can hire another color?  We sure can.  Wow.  We should hire them.  Oh, Opie, we should hire them to sing your song.  How cool would that be?  That would come in and sing your song.  I don't know.  They're pretty busy.  Are they?  Where are they playing?  Applebee's Neighborhood Bar and Grill.  Oh, my God.  Tubby's Pizza.  Oh, no.  E-Rock has a pizza place.  Ah, E-Rock's fat.  Hey, fucking Chastity Bono, get in here.  I want to talk to you. 
[02:12:30]  Hold on.  They're a hit on the pizza circuit, though.  They really are.  They're playing Clifton's Pizza Company as well.  They're playing Beer Nose by the Bridge.  That's handy.  You could jump off of it when you're done.  Look at your career.  They're playing in an Irish pub.  That's good.  I heard him, Ralph.  That's good.  I heard you, Ralph.  Another pizza company.  Oh, that's the same one.  They're going back to the same pizza place?  Yeah, they're probably a big hit there.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  After 20 years, they're playing pizza joints.  You think they go...  At an Irish pub.  You think that's their encore at the pizza place? 
[02:13:00]  They play the Hopi's on WBAB's song?  They forgot about that song years ago.  And you might remember this one.  That's what they look like in 92.  92.  All right.  She's a little thick around the...  Yeah, she's got Al Yankovic behind her.  And weird Al Yankovic is playing guitar.  Holy fuck.  At the pizza place.  Wow.  It's good to look back, isn't it? 
[02:13:30]  No.  It never is.  No.  This guy knows a little something about this.  Dan in Hicksville.  Dan.  What?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hi, Dan.  The song that was recorded, it was recorded at a place called Artie, which was a 7-Eleven  that turned into a recording studio.  Now it closed down and turned back into a convenience store, like a dot-head shack.  Oh.  Okay.  We got it.  All right.  That song fucking drove it out of business.  The speakers all just hung themselves.  The speakers. 
[02:14:00]  Let's go to break.  The Marshall amps just fell over.  Will Jimmy Norton was on Jay Leno last night.  Certainly was.  How is that possible?  And how are you here?  I like to fly at night.  I'm very confused.  You were on TV last night and on our show today.  Yeah.  I like to hop on that red eye.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It was kind of like Chip and me talking together.  Yeah, it was.  Couldn't commit.  Chip was going to happen.  I'm doing chip lip, but I'm trying to talk like Jim.  But Colin was going to be all happy that you were doing chip.  He fucking worships chip.  We'll find out when Colin's in here. 
[02:14:30]  Perfect sense, too.  All he was doing was asking chip questions in front of everybody.  What do you think?  You know, Chip, what do you think?  Hey, fucking Colin.  Hey, cut me a break.  Oh, you used scissors in the mic there.  That's kind of a visual but audio joke.  Yeah, cut me a break.  Very funny, Chip.  Thanks.  God, Chip is funny.  Well, here's Jim Norton, who doesn't do chip on Jay Leno's show for some reason.  Would love to.  I wish I had the ball to do chip on Jay's show. 
[02:15:00]  Right, Jay?  Or something?  Yeah, wait.  The Tonight Show.  Oh, this was my Tonight Show joke.  I was going to say, Tonight Show, boy.  They better hope they'll start showing this in the afternoon.  Please try a chip on Leno's show.  Please.  I beg you.  He'd never invite you back.  I beg you.  Debbie, the exec producer would probably just go, What was that?  Yeah, what?  Why did you talk like that?  Was that voice in the face that's stupid?  Well, here's Jimmy on Leno last night.  A little taste.  All right, let's move on to the next, I'll pick this one. 
[02:15:30]  Has the Guinness Book of World Records run out of ideas?  A 42-year-old, 600-pound New Jersey mom is trying to eat her way to the Guinness Book  of World Records by becoming the fattest woman in the world at 1,000, oh my God, at 1,000  pounds.  Last week, a Wyoming man underwent over 1,500 body piercings in a single five-hour session  to break the world record for the number of body piercings.  Are people hurting themselves just to become famous, and should Guinness allow this?  Well, I love the big fat lady.  Her boyfriend is 150 pounds, and he's a fat admirer, which is just kind of creepy. 
[02:16:00]  She probably doesn't even watch pornography.  She just masturbates to footage of the Hindenburg.  With that in mind, let's move on to Megan.  I think what's really disturbing about this is this woman has a website where you can  donate money, so you're literally donating money to watch her kill herself, and it's  a really weird element we are in society, and I find the whole thing disturbing.  I don't know.  It's really sad. 
[02:16:30]  Adam?  Well, first off, why wear underpants when you're covered by your own pants?  And the underpants are big enough for a circus tent anyway, so I mean, we could be sending  that material to Haiti to build relief for these people.  And no, somebody's going to kill themselves.  They shouldn't have these categories like eating yourself to death, like how many self-inflicted 
[02:17:00]  machete wounds could you sustain?  They shouldn't do that.  They should be liable.  All right.  There you go.  That's it.  That is J-Chat.  Adam Carolla.  Peggy McCain.  Jim Norton.  Be right back with the music of Phoenix.  Couldn't tell, Howard, I'm too tired today.  We'll have to reschedule.  Thanks.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:17:30]  Fucking haven't slept in days.  What happened?  Jimmy's tired, too.  You're the only one awake today and 18 hours of sleep.  You've had your sleepy days in here, but you slept like a fucking baby last night.  Yes, I did.  Because I got a baby on the way, I'm not sleeping.  You're going to sleep like you had a baby.  Oh, Jesus.  Because that's a lot of waking up.  They say you don't sleep when the baby's born.  I'm not sleeping already.  I think you just have a lot on your mind.  I don't really have much on my mind. 
[02:18:00]  I want to get the show on the road.  That's a lot on the mind.  When you decide to become a father and have a kid, you just want to get the show on the road.  You don't want to wait.  And the last month is fucking brutal.  Dude, when you're at launch point, you're getting like...  Any day now.  Yeah, so you're getting kind of, you know, you're probably nervous, even though you're not thinking about it.  But when you try to sleep, you get about it.  How are you sleeping?  I'm not sleeping.  How do you not just lay there and stare at the ceiling going,  I'm going to be a father to something.  To something.  It's crazy.  I went to bed at 9.30 last night, and the last time I checked the clock was 1.30. 
[02:18:30]  Four hours of just trying to sleep.  And then you try to fall asleep, and then that puts you in panic mode, and now you're definitely not sleeping.  You start counting, all right, if I fell asleep right now...  And you know what, Dr. Steve?  Fuck you.  Oh, my God.  Because I've been consulting Dr. Steve on my sleep problem, and he's like, have you tried yoga on the TV?  Maybe he meant yoga.  How the fuck are you going to get up there anyway?  To flat screen.  Oh. 
[02:19:00]  You'll fall off.  Yoga on the TV.  It's very thin up there, yes.  Dr. Steve gives terrible advice.  Dude, he gave me sleep advice.  Like, you know, make sure you don't drink coffee, make sure you don't eat too late, make sure you don't work out.  Uh, too late in the day, don't have any fucking snacks, and then he's like, you might want to try a warm glass of milk.  Cryogenic freezing.  And then he's like, and there's this yoga program that beats the shit out of me on the TV.  You might want to try that, but don't do it too late in the day, because that'll have the reverse effect. 
[02:19:30]  It's like an old country doctor advice.  What is that?  He's a pumpkin.  Like, give me a fucking pill that knocks me out.  You're a doctor.  Thanks, Doc Holliday.  Fuck this yoga shit.  You go to the pumpkin dance and tucker yourself out.  Right.  And then have, get Parkinson's.  Go to the Sadie Hawkins dinner.  Fuck.  Wait, why?  Way to fucking not get the hint.  I'm calling you.  That means send me fucking pills.  Jesus Christ.  And knock me the fuck out.  Done with that Tylenol PM and shit. 
[02:20:00]  Now, how do you think you're going to react once you're hearing crying baby and trying to sleep?  Oh, uh, I'm going to be all right.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Sure?  I said all right.  I'm not going to be happy about it, but I'm going to be all right.  Yeah.  Like, because are you, um, over the years I've heard, very light sleeper.  Extremely.  And why?  Because mommy had to fucking, uh, be an inch away from my nostrils to make sure air was  coming out of him in the middle of the night.  Where's my seatbelt?  Jesus Christ.  I'm strapping.  You know, the threat of crib death ends after, what, a year or so. 
[02:20:30]  Not, not well into your fucking teens, mom.  The fuck?  I'm going to be all right.  Was she rolling you over so you're sleeping on your back?  I thought there was many nights I woke up and I'm seeing my mom's eyes inches from my face.  And she was just checking your breathing, right?  Yeah.  Oh yeah, none of that shit.  Pulse breathing.  Put an IV in.  Yeah, none of that, none of that weird shit.  No, no.  What, uh, so now, now I'm just saying, now you, you finally fall asleep, let's say.  Baby starts crying.  Aren't your eyes going to open up and wake you back up again?  Yeah, we're, we're, we're talking, we're talking about things. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, she's cool.  Soundproof booth.  I got, we got, we got a few rooms.  I might have to, you know, shuffle off to another room.  Yeah.  Depending.  I mean, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll do my part.  I'm not going to be like.  I'm just thinking about sleep.  It's got to be the hardest goddamn thing.  Because everybody I know that's had kids, the biggest thing is like, oh my God, I never sleep.  I like have such a hard time.  Yeah.  Getting asleep or staying asleep.  I like.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  I like being punchy.  I don't mind being punchy on the show.  Yeah.  But, uh, just completely exhausted. 
[02:21:30]  That's, that's what I got.  But tired is, uh, yeah.  A little punchy doesn't, doesn't hurt.  That hurts.  When we're punchy on the show, we get some, some good radio out there.  Mm.  Two Klonopin will knock your ass out.  But I'm not a pill guy.  But Dr. Steve, Jesus, fucking try the yoga on the TV.  Once you start getting into the pill thing, oof.  Nah, nah.  I'm not a pill guy.  Now you got a problem.  See, because my, my mama didn't believe in pills or alcohol or none of that shit.  And now she's fucking.  I believe in alcohol a lot.  Now she's fucking addicted to pills.  It's true. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, yeah, see?  Wow.  Yeah, the, uh, I slept, I slept for a very long time yesterday because, uh, the workout thing.  Oh, wait, is Dr. Steve riding me?  He stepped it up a little bit.  He stepped up my weight a little bit.  Yeah.  So now instead of just his cock, he's just cocking both balls?  Yes, exactly.  And do you know how heavy those balls are?  Yes.  But it made me very sleepy.  It was good.  I like it.  See, you're, you're, you're rubbing it in now.  Why?  Get Dr. Steve on the phone with his stupid sleep advice. 
[02:22:30]  I've had it with this guy.  You know how soon I need to sleep?  What?  I, uh, I've been looking lately at this very fat vagina from Cleveland and I was watching  what looked, appeared to be home videos.  Wow.  Of her boyfriend having sex with her.  Really?  Yes.  Makes you sleep like a baby.  Oh.  He has a big penis.  Does he?  Yeah.  And I kind of like, is it, I don't know why I like watching a bigger penis and a vagina.  Is that gay?  Yeah.  Well.  No, I don't know.  I don't know why I like that.  I think it's gayer than my theme song, if you want to know the truth. 
[02:23:00]  But I don't want to see a small dick in a vagina.  Not a small dick, but what about just a dick?  I have a big dick.  It's like a dick.  So if you're watching a movie, you're not concentrating on, oh my God, that guy's dick isn't big enough.  It's just a dick.  If you see one that's too small or too big, you go like, well, that's freakish, but just a dick.  Now you like a bigger dick.  That's odd, Jimmy.  I said when I'm watching pornography, I happened to see a video of a young lady from Cleveland.  I showed her plump vagina, and her boyfriend was banging her, and he had what appeared to be a large penis. 
[02:23:30]  Right, right, good, good.  But it's not like I want to shove that in my anus.  It was just cool to watch, because I want to see porn-style fucking.  My goodness.  Now what about that cock we're watching right there?  That's pornography.  That's pornography, that's for you, you want to see, the girl's sucking.  Is that even fucking possible?  Of course it is.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, you just got to start with the balls.  Oh.  You mean with such a small dick?  That's what I want to see, a porno dick in a girl's, because the girl liking a- 
[02:24:00]  That's forced perspective.  A girl liking a big dick, yeah, but she's also, unless they got midget hands, that's a massive cock.  Anthony's a porn blocker.  He's like, ah, the fucking mirrors.  I'm so glad you're concerned about my sleep problem, and now we're talking about big cocks.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks for caring.  That'll help you sleep.  Just a little bit about me.  That'll help you sleep.  I'm in fucking hell, and you blew me off to fucking talk about big cocks.  Jack off to this, you'll fucking doze right off.  With a fucking nice batch on your belly.  What the fuck? 
[02:24:30]  Does he bury that thing?  Does he go balls deep in it with that?  That's impossible.  That's nice.  Yeah, you could tell that she's, I mean, she's probably not enjoying it as much as she would  with a small arm.  She's pierced down there.  She's pierced on her nipples.  If you're pierced down there, you could handle more cock.  He's doing the old rub from clitoris to the opening to get a little lube going.  That gag.  It's like, yeah, I gotta rub this around a little bit.  What, is he trying to hollow her out?  That's not fitting, man.  All right, he's going in.  He's about a quarter, and then he goes about a...  Look at where that will end up.  Balls deep. 
[02:25:00]  Above her belly button.  That's up by her lungs.  That's poking her diaphragm.  It's going to go through her head like the fucking Bjork guy who shot himself when the  fucking bullet bubbled his head.  I'm getting sleep advice.  Michelle from PA writes, never look at the clock.  That's true.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, really?  How about the cock?  There's one.  Yeah, there you go.  Maybe she'll put an extra letter in there.  And then someone is suggesting simply sleep at Walgreens.  What the fuck is simply sleep?  Is that like a supplement? 
[02:25:30]  Is that a sleep supplement?  I don't know.  First of all, you're forced to look at the clock when you get up as early as we do.  Because if you're not sleeping, you want to know if you've got to get up for fucking  work.  Right.  Because it's still dark out.  And then you panic.  Yeah, you start panicking.  Like, oh, fuck, I only have an hour left that I could possibly get some sleep in.  Let's say hi to Paul in Florida.  Paul.  I'm right here.  Oh, Uncle.  Hey, Opie.  Hey.  I've got two kids, and I use earplugs.  And they actually...  Why?  That way you can't hear when they yell.  You shove one down each kid's windpipe? 
[02:26:00]  Jesus.  For your wife to take care of.  When they're crying real loud, you catch earplugs.  I'm an earplug guy already.  I can't sleep with earplugs.  I hear my own breathing too loud.  Yeah, I don't like hearing all kinds of...  It's like...  I hear tinnitus.  Really?  Yeah, I hear like a...  I don't like that.  Oh, the morning mashup's fighting again.  I just got to communique, so that's good.  It's like strapping two...  Wow, that guy...  Jesus Christ, that flew right over her head.  What a shot.  This video's got it all.  That money shot fucking flew on her head. 
[02:26:30]  See?  That flew right over her head.  So you don't want to see a big dick in a fucking giant...  With a porno?  Yes.  Trading on his fucking money shot.  I like to see a fucking girl's fucking taking it.  He fucking put a Zorro across her face.  Of course he did.  The mark of Zorro is right across her fucking face.  I don't want to fly.  I've seen fucking happier faces eating lima beans.  She's fucking miserable.  Look at this first shot.  I hate the tongue ring, but watch the comsy.  It just went flying past her, man.  Spider-Man.  It gives her the John Locke scar on her eye. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, the Omar from the wire scar on the fucking rest of her head.  That's fantastic.  Let's say hi to Dave in Chicago.  Dave.  Hey, we had...  My wife and I had a baby February 23rd,  and he's got colic.  That's...  I haven't slept more than four hours since.  Aw.  He's got colic?  Yeah.  What's colic?  Baby's a little colicky.  It's where his gut can't, you know, process things.  He's all gassy and...  Right, yeah.  It's a mess, but he'll get through it. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We're looking at live coverage of our last shuttle coming in.  No, this is it, right?  No, they got a couple more.  Oh, they got two more?  I thought this was the last one.  No.  Now, that right there is really fucking high.  They're able to put the cameras on that thing at, like...  Can they move the fucking...  The chiron at the bottom?  I know.  Why?  That's more important.  Yeah.  That...  You know, when...  We forgot to mention, when they...  That's amazing.  When they did Masters coverage,  everyone wanted to know about Tiger Woods,  and they were doing golf coverage and golf highlights? 
[02:28:00]  Yes.  You couldn't even see the ball going to the cup  because of all that horse shit that's below the screen.  They moved it.  Yeah.  On the bottom of the screen.  They can track that thing way the fuck up there.  I don't even know how high, but...  How do they keep the camera steady?  It's amazing what they could do now.  Now it's going to go into the clouds.  Well, no, it could just be passing above the clouds  and the camera could just be not...  Yeah.  How high is that one, though?  That might not be...  It's about a mile.  I'm not sure.  That might be low, actually.  It's coming in.  Yeah, it's close to landing now.  It's leveling a little bit, but...  They're pretty... 
[02:28:30]  The amazing thing about the shuttle,  they're pretty fucked because it just glides.  When they come in on a fucking...  Like, when you see them coming in,  they do a giant...  Like, they come in on an angle,  and they use the bottom of the shuttle  to slow it down, the wind resistance.  But they have one shot at landing.  There's no propulsion.  There's no taking off.  That's why their glide slope is really long  and really straight when they come in.  That's why they need a place like Edwards  or down in Florida.  How long do you think they have the runway?  They were actually really low.  It's some of the longest runways 
[02:29:00]  they've ever built.  A footer.  I got a hot on.  A footer.  Yo, what's up?  Oh, yeah.  I never brought this up on here,  but I have two six-month-old twins, bro.  Yeah.  And it's fucking...  It's the best,  but it's fucking mayhem at times.  I mean, there you go.  It's like non-stop crying.  Meanwhile, on the radio,  my little girl stinks  because she won't cry on cue.  No, we heard some crying, man.  But, like I said, it's great,  but you need to just...  You and your chick,  first of all, you're rich. 
[02:29:30]  Get a nanny for nighttime.  That's first of all.  But you and your chick,  you got to kind of just be patient  with each other  because you're going to want to  triangle each other.  Yeah.  Strangle each other.  All right.  These guys are more concerned  about a space shuttle landing  than my horrible sleep.  I really appreciate  that they show up  maybe an ounce of fucking concern.  That was just in outer space.  You're in bed.  Who gives a shit?  There's a hundred of those  that landed prior to this one.  It's going to be the same fucking thing.  I made it.  I live with bad sleep.  Dude, I go two days 
[02:30:00]  without sleep at some time.  I don't mind.  It stinks.  But I know what it is.  I'm never sharing again  because you guys don't give flying fuck  about anything that I do.  There's only two shuttles left.  Who gives a shit?  I do.  I'm looking with pride  knowing that that's going to be gone.  I'll show you a montage  of that exact thing.  Yeah, but it's coming to an end  and we should still have a spacecraft  and we don't.  I watch it with pride  but yet with a little nostalgia and sadness.  I'm not sleeping, god damn it.  And if it wasn't for Hitler... 
[02:30:30]  Oh, boy.  What were you saying?  I sat through your Hitler thing.  You can't sit through my sleep problem  for two minutes?  Hitler was an insomniac, too.  Was he?  He had a lot done.  He had a lot done.  Yeah.  Did you hear what I said?  He'd probably wake up  and I ran out of steam.  That's how tired I am.  He'd probably wake up.  Yeah, he did a few times.  Now you turn the tired thing  into it being about you.  I'm tired.  No, but I'm saying  that's why I don't have as much...  Ken and Austin.  Ken.  As much concentration on it  because I know what it's like  and I deal with it, too.  Ken. 
[02:31:00]  Yes.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, you're having trouble sleeping.  I saw a psychiatrist about it  and the best advice I got  was to get a book on tape  that you...  Books on tape?  Give me a goddamn pill!  And you eat it.  You eat the fucking thing.  What the fuck?  What book?  Any book.  Like, get an interview  from a podcast  that's something you would think  would be totally boring.  Some kind of financial report  or something like that. 
[02:31:30]  This is the advice I'm getting?  Books on tape?  That's a nice bit of advice.  Books on tape?  Sure.  Get a good book,  like War and Peace.  So just when you're about  to doze off...  And then they came  with the weapons blazing!  You put it in your iPod  and just let it go.  All right, you just keep  with the real advice  while I'm having fun.  Yeah, we get it.  We know.  Thank you.  Book on tape, guy.  Book on tape.  Book on tape.  Let's go to River Red Dock  in upstate New York.  Okay, bugs me.  Hey, how you doing?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  It's not his birthday. 
[02:32:00]  Hey, go rub one out  to xhamster.com  and then take an Ambien.  All right?  Get like two or three  of those pills.  Right on.  Right on.  X Hamster.  X Hamster?  That's a good porno site.  What do you say?  What do you say?  You get a little porno up.  You get a little ambien.  You get worked up.  Yeah.  Don't focus on the porn.  I'm saying just get rid of it.  Oh, focus on the porn.  What do you focus on  on an X Hamster?  The fucking,  the video quality?  Yeah, dummy.  What don't,  what are you supposed  to focus on on X Hamster?  He's right.  You know,  at X Hamster,  you got all flavors there. 
[02:32:30]  But the point is,  after that,  get an Ambien.  Take an Ambien,  get in bed,  and go to sleep.  And it'll knock you out.  And you'll wake up  very refreshed.  But you need eight hours  of an Ambien though.  But the problem  with the Ambien,  it's highly addicting.  I don't want to get  an Ambien cough mopey.  And you're only supposed  to use it for like a week.  No shit.  Huh?  Who says it's highly addictive?  Lydia?  Everyone says that.  Everyone says it's highly addictive.  Not just Lydia  and her giant mammoth tics.  Yeah, I've talked about  my sleep problem with people  and they're like,  well, the Ambien's a,  you know, 
[02:33:00]  a little help for the short track.  I've been taking it  for six years,  but I mean,  I don't want to get hooked on it.  No, I'm kidding.  Oh, Jesus.  No way.  I just stole an old prior joke.  Cocaine ain't a big deal.  I have all the different  sleep aids out there  and each one of them  have hangovers  or they have problems.  Each one of them,  maybe each one of them  are different  for each individual,  but Ambien  is literally  the only one.  Right with your Ambien.  A phone call  is like Ambien.  This guy's name  is Ann Byan.  That just was terribly shoehorned. 
[02:33:30]  Of course it was.  I loved it.  Ambien.  Sometimes the stinkiest ones  are best.  Oh, but it was fucking,  this guy's a fucking,  it's an Ambien bonanza  with this guy  every time he talks.  He loves the Ambien.  How about a shot?  How about you do  a little shot of fucking Jack  before you go to bed?  Right on.  A whiskey breath.  You'll roll over  and tell your loved one,  goodnight.  whiskey breath.  It smells like fucking  Lavoris. 
[02:34:00]  Or fucking,  what's the other one?  Oh, Listerine.  I met Lavoris.  Dr. Steve.  Hey, man.  I read your  eight page email.  I read your book,  goddammit.  And I'm still not sleeping.  Okay, well.  And, you know,  you suggested what?  Warm milk.  What was it?  Diet Coke?  Coffee?  Oh, no, no.  Old Doc Baker  from Little House on the Prairie.  What's next?  You suggested some yoga  on the TV.  What was the yoga  on the TV thing?  Yeah, what else,  Kevorkian? 
[02:34:30]  Frozen yoga.  It was,  sorry, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You make the jokes.  I'll just sit here.  Well, here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Great.  When I emailed you,  one of the stipulations  was that you didn't  want to take any drug.  Right.  Right.  I'm not a pill guy.  Yeah, that's cool.  But I'm starting to think  I might be a pill guy.  Maybe heroin.  Right.  Well, the people, 
[02:35:00]  they've done studies  on people who take pills  and initially,  they'll sleep really well  because their bodies  are not used to the medication.  They'll sleep well.  All right.  I'm that guy.  Okay, well.  Where do I get the pills?  I'm that guy.  You don't need to continue.  All right, Doc.  You got them.  All right.  Well.  Okay, well.  They'll do a study  on another hundred people  who do this thing  called sleep hygiene.  And sleep hygiene  is just a bunch of techniques 
[02:35:30]  to improve sleep.  And they'll find  that after six weeks,  the people who do  the sleep hygiene  actually sleep better  than the people  taking pills.  What is sleep hygiene?  Well.  Fascinating.  Strap in it.  Yeah.  Basically what sleep hygiene  entails is a set of...  Can I guess, Steve?  Can I guess?  I think I know what it is.  All right, Jimmy.  It's when you doze off  and you're just about  to fall asleep  and your loved one  comes over with  a cold bucket of water  and a scrub brush 
[02:36:00]  and goes...  Jesus.  And washes you  like you're a tire.  Yeah.  Real rough.  Shooker, shooker, shooker, shooker.  Hi, Gene.  Fucking Jimmy.  Hey, you can't even talk.  That would be so distracting  if you were trying to sleep.  Oh my God, you would never sleep  shooker, shooker, shoo,  with a scratchy brush.  Leave scrapes on you.  A big handle on it  to get a good grip.  Is that part of the clean white walls? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Is that part of the sleep hygiene there?  Sleep hygiene?  Is that part of it?  Yeah, that's part of it.  Well, one of the things is  it's going to be very difficult for you.  This is what your problem is,  sleeping.  Stress and schedule.  Okay?  And with sleep hygiene,  you need,  they always counsel you  to go to bed  at the same time every day.  Well, when you've got a job  where you have to get up  at four in the morning 
[02:37:00]  five days a week  and then two days a week,  you're off,  who wants to get,  you know,  go to bed at nine in the morning  or nine at night every night  and then get up  at four in the morning  even on the weekend?  It's crazy.  All right,  you just cured my sleep problem.  Could you make this phone call  to me every night at 9.30, please?  Holy shit,  what a bore you are.  Oh, my God.  You've done radio before.  Come on, let's go.  Okay, well,  that's number one.  That's your problem.  The other thing is 
[02:37:30]  you're getting ready  to have a baby  and the stress is,  even if you don't feel it,  it's there  and that's another reason  why you're not asleep.  All right,  but tell these guys  about the milk  and the fucking yoga  on the TV.  You'll get on the TV.  All right.  What you don't want to do  is exercise  within about three hours  of going to bed, okay,  because that actually  revs up your system.  You feel like,  well, I'm exerting energy  so it's going to make me sleepy.  It actually wakes you up. 
[02:38:00]  You actually just helped me  because one of the things  I've been trying,  if it's late,  I'll actually go down  and run on the treadmill  and then when I'm done running,  I just collapse  on the treadmill  and try to sleep.  But it always knocks me  onto the floor.  Well, it might be  very effective for you, Jim.  I'm tired.  It's one of those things  that people will make  this mistake  that, well,  I'm going to work out  and then go to bed  and try to sleep  and then they can't sleep 
[02:38:30]  and they wonder why.  But the exception to that  actually is yoga.  There's a guy,  you know,  if you go to the Oxygen Network.  He wants me to go to Oxygen  and do yoga on the TV.  All I want you to do  is there's a guy  at six in the morning  called Steve Ross  who does a yoga show  and he's got a couple  hot women  but most of them  have sweaty armpits  and stuff  so it's a little gross  but they do a yoga show.  You added the hot women thing 
[02:39:00]  because you didn't want people  to think you were gay  because you're doing  Steve Ross' yoga.  You look at Steve Ross  and you kind of hope  he shit's in your mouth.  So you had to add  the hot female thing.  I'm sorry,  you're a doctor.  I shouldn't say that.  How about you be secure  with your sexuality,  you fucking winemaking creep.  I apologize.  Oh, sorry.  Go ahead.  Your show.  All right, go ahead.  The yoga on the TV,  this is Steve Ross.  Why is he so special?  Well, I mean,  you could do anybody's yoga  but that's just one  that's free  and at six in the morning 
[02:39:30]  you DVR it.  You can run through  the commercials,  get it done in 45 minutes  and people think of yoga  as just being  sort of attaining  these positions.  Excuse me, Dr. Steve,  not to interrupt you.  We're looking at a picture  of Steve Ross.  What kind of commercials  during his show?  Fucking AZT ads?  He is a bit thin.  Holy fuck,  is he a fucking fruit?  He's a leader of a cult.  Yeah, he really is.  Creepy looking.  He's fucking horseshoe bald.  No, he's all right.  He's got a good sense of humor. 
[02:40:00]  I mean, do any yoga.  They say pussy and he laughs.  Sorry we're making fun  of your boy, Steve Ross.  I know, you're coming off  like he's fucking Chuck Liddell.  God forbid we make fun  of Steve Ross.  Well, you can do Rodney Yee.  He's another one that you do.  I ain't doing Rodney Yee.  Exactly.  That's what you need  as a fucking Asian guy.  Oh, I get another speck.  Rodney!  I get no respect.  Go to Lotus.  Hey, I tell you.  Need some sleep.  Have to go to Dr. Vinnie Boombat. 
[02:40:30]  Make a horrible whine.  He said, I give you  a second opinion.  He said, your eyes  are crooked too.  Rodney Yee's a boob.  He's awful.  I'd rather fucking do yoga  with Rodney King.  He's doing the fucking  downward crook  with a fucking  knife thing  across his teeth.  Jesus.  All right.  What's so special  about this yoga guy? 
[02:41:00]  Well, what it is  is it causes  and it's a very intense  cardio workout  where you'll be sweating  and your heart is pounding  and then they do  five minutes of this thing  called the big relax  at the end  and that's where  you get your huge benefits.  You get a big rush  of endorphins  that makes you  very sleepy  and you can do yoga  and just  it's better than a Valium  as far as  getting rid of your stress.  Yeah, the five minutes  at the end  is where Rodney Yee  comes over  and fucking buries 
[02:41:30]  his nose in your belly button  until you're  coming to his mouth  and you fall asleep  and you're living  on the floor  after a homosexual encounter.  Curled up in the corner  crying.  Yeah, with your fucking  sweatpants  around your ankles  while fucking Rodney Yee  steals your jewelry.  When am I supposed  to do the yoga  on the TV  if you're not supposed  to work out  three hours  before you go to sleep?  True, but you're telling me  this yoga is going  to make you sleepy  so that doesn't make sense.  Well, yoga is the exception  to that.  Why is that? 
[02:42:00]  If your heart is  and you're sweating.  Because of what they do  at the end  of the yoga things  is this big relaxation  where it's sort of  a meditative fight  that takes you  completely out  of the situation  drops your adrenaline level  increases your endorphin level  and you get very  very sleepy  and this would be  something that I'd  recommend that you do  when you get home  from work on it.  I got a recommendation  for you.  Why don't you get  that fucking script pad  of yours  and write me 
[02:42:30]  a goddamn prescription.  I'm dying over here.  I'm dying over here.  I need a goddamn pill.  I think Dr. Steve's  on the right mark.  Oh, really?  Would you do yoga  with that guy?  With some of the  holistic methods  that he's coming up with.  I think a five and a half  hour nap yesterday  is not conducive  to my sleeping schedule.  Exactly right.  Exactly right.  Let me explain  to Dr. Steve  what his pal Anthony did.  I got home.  I didn't nap.  I worked out.  And then I sat 
[02:43:00]  on the couch  and two hours later  I fell asleep  for 18 hours.  I'm not kidding.  18 hours  I slept  after working out yesterday.  But that was also  due to the  wacky sleep schedule  I had over the weekend.  Yeah.  I don't think  I had a Saturday.  You slept on the couch  for that long?  Yeah, I was sitting  on the couch  watching TV  and the next thing  I knew  I was waking up  and it was  like 11 o'clock  and Sunday night.  That's good.  Yeah, it was just  crazy sleep. 
[02:43:30]  Dr. Steve,  you're a fan  of the Twitter, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  Fred Nola writes  Dr. Steve  should milk your prostate.  You will fall asleep.  Oh, that might do it.  And he also writes  at the end of yoga  Dr. Steve  felches jizz  out of his life partner's ass.  Dr. Steve  does not do that.  Yes.  He's the felchy.  Terrible.  That's right.  Felchy.  Oh, and by the way  I'm going to call  my new friend  Michu Kaku.  He'll tell me  how to sleep nice. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, yeah.  He'll tell you  how to sleep.  Get him to write  you a prescription.  Sleep is like a river  with many eddies  and whirlpools.  And what you need  to do  is imagine yourself  as Rip Van Winkle.  Shut it.  What about this  Valerian root shit?  Yeah, now Valerian root...  Who's Valerian?  That old gag.  It has some side effects  but yeah, I mean  listen, again  going back to what  we were first talking about  the stipulation 
[02:44:30]  that you gave me  was no pharmacology  and I assume...  All right, ignore that shit.  Huh?  We're moving on from that.  Ignore that.  Okay, all right.  Very good.  You're being so obnoxious  to Dr. Steve.  Well, you would too  if you haven't slept  in two days.  What?  No, absolutely.  Are you panicking on us?  You're right.  One thing Dr. Kaku  didn't talk about yesterday.  You want to talk  about something else?  Yes.  Yes, Dr. Steve.  There is... 
[02:45:00]  They have detected  faster than light speed  motion in a galaxy  a few million light years  from us  and it's a kind of radiation  that they've never seen before.  Now this was  theoretically impossible.  Well, what it is  is this thing's moving  four times faster  than the speed of light  but what it probably is  is a jet  from a black hole  in another galaxy  and it's shooting  at an angle to us 
[02:45:30]  at very close  to the speed of light  and actually causes  an optical illusion  that makes it look like  it's traveling faster  than the speed of light.  Oh, right, right.  What's a jet?  Astronomers are freaking out  about this  because it's something  that they've not seen before.  Wait, what do you mean  it's a jet though?  Okay.  Like the exit?  When black holes spin  they'll make a...  they will accrete  a disc around them  and when that happens  as matter falls into it  it will create a jet 
[02:46:00]  going at bright angles  to the spin  and it will shoot out  particles at right close  to the speed of light  like 0.99997%  or a fraction  of the speed of light  and when it does that  it screws up  you know  time slows down  the faster you go  and it actually creates  an optical illusion  that makes it look like  the matter in the jets  are moving faster  than the speed of light.  So it might not  be going faster than light. 
[02:46:30]  I heard it was 0.998  not 0.997.  No, I did.  I heard it was 0.998.  999!  But Dr. Steve  if you know that  how come the astronomers  are freaking out?  Like if they already know  that that's possible  what are they freaking out?  What it is  is this thing  is not displaying  the regular  radiation pattern  of a black hole  that's shooting out a jet  so it's got to be a jet  but they don't know  what's causing it 
[02:47:00]  because it's  maybe it's  it doesn't have x-rays  it's not shooting out  gamma rays  at the right rate  all those things  it's just very interesting  Jimmy almost bombed  oh damn it  he held back  it would have been  a doozy  a dudamundo  well go ahead  and tell us  yeah yeah  what were you going to say  Jim?  you said  I'm sure it would have been good  go ahead  yeah he's going to tell us  you said you didn't know  what was causing the jet  and I was going to say 
[02:47:30]  maybe it was  one of Benny's  oh god damn it  oh wow  oh my  oh my  oh god  yeah  that was a Chip line  it's not even  Chip wouldn't even  sully himself  with that terrible line  please don't mention Chip  what's wrong with me  alright Steve  so we didn't accomplish  anything with this  sleep phone call  no he said  I'm not doing the  yoga  hygienic sleep 
[02:48:00]  or something  what did you want  to accomplish  really  unconsciousness  yeah  exactly  I'll call you  after the show  we'll get you to sleep  alright  hey Dr. Steve  that's exactly what will happen  he'll call you  and you'll fall asleep  oh that's nice  oh Danny has a comment  for you  I just want to thank  Dr. Steve  for my housewarming present  Dr. Steve got me  a very nice  weird medicine  chamber pot  that I've been using  wow  so thank you very much  for that Steve  a real chamber pot  yeah with Dr. Steve's  caricature on it 
[02:48:30]  and everything  and a little handle  Dr. Steve is the king  of merchandising  when it comes to that show  I don't even know  it's something that you  piss in  you piss in it  what  yeah it's a chamber pot  it's called a chamber pot  oh that's a beer stein  oh I've been taking  pisses in it  at night  at least it's better  than his wine  oh Dr. Steve  I'm teasing of course  you know I'll drink anything  yeah but you're not  you're not opening up  his bottle first  now are you  well I have a few hundred  to go through  before I get to his 
[02:49:00]  it's the end of the night  bottle when it doesn't  matter anymore  it's the doorstop  in my wine cellar  Steve's is the wine  that Anthony gives blacks  when they come over  so it's never getting opened  you know who did just that  Bill Blumenreich  what did he  really  yep  and the woman goes  wow this is the best wine  I ever tasted  this fucking wine  turned weeks ago  I was up there for a little  something something  and I  I knew my wine a little  better than I do now  and  and  we started with a bottle 
[02:49:30]  and then this couple  came in  a black couple  oh my god  and all of a sudden  he's pouring another wine  this is  this is the god's honest  truth  and this woman's like  oh my god  it's delicious  this is the best wine  I've ever had  and I took a sip  and I looked at  what's wrong with the wine we got  and I looked at Bill  and I went  you mother effer  I know exactly what you're doing  you're getting  you're getting rid of some of that  bad wine  Cabernet  the fucking bottle was open  for easily a week  easily  really  it was so obvious  that the one I turned  what a racist  well 
[02:50:00]  I'm not saying  alright Dr. Steve  I  I don't know what to tell you  Dr. Steve  thank you so much  for being the resident  doctor  expert  on our program  thank you for what  what did we accomplish  he gave you a lot of good  holistic methods  of sleeping  do yoga  on TV  and  don't take a nap  and don't take a nap  when you're  oh  listen  when you're tired  exercise  it seems counterintuitive  but that's  if it's not bedtime 
[02:50:30]  and you're tired  if you exercise  you will be reinvigorated  you won't be tired  Dr. Steve is telling the truth  because there have been many times  I've been very tired  wanted to nap  didn't nap  the trainer comes over  I start exercising  I'm up as a pup  you've been training for two weeks  I've been training for three to four weeks  wow  yes  good boy  and I'm feeling it yo  I'm feeling it  I'm eating better  I'm exercising  I'm feeling  we stepped up in weight  and I'm able to actually lift more than I was  come on 
[02:51:00]  don't be a hater  be a masturbator  what are you bench pressing  what  not bench pressing  that's counterintuitive  why would I bench press  Dr. Steve's words  I love Dr. Steve  why would  I am using practical muscles  practical muscle movement  and practical workouts  where  I'm not going to be laying on my back  pushing shit up  so why the fuck  am I going to do bench presses  yeah  I am doing exercises  that are practical  get that beach body  in motion  you want a beach body 
[02:51:30]  I want to be in shape  you want to look like  the situation  by fucking July  not really  not really  Anthony has a beach body  he's the guy on his fucking  he's fucking  while Mac  kicks sand in his face  and then I open up a book  with George Atlas on it  and want to be him  Dr. Steve  you have any of that propofol  I want to try that shit  oh yeah  why not  a little taste  yeah a little taste  a little taste  yeah that stuff is  rough stuff  we  the only time we use that  in the hospital  is when someone's actually 
[02:52:00]  on the ventilator  and they've got a machine  holy shit  hey man  when I got scoped  they gave me a little propofol  didn't they  that's a time machine drug  holy shit  how quick did you wake up  though  that's the thing  they only gave me a taste  I don't even know  they said I was out  15 minutes maybe  yeah  it seemed like hours  and you know what  I felt rested  yeah you can use propofol  for scopes and stuff  they just use a very small amount  and you go under  and then you wake right back up again 
[02:52:30]  within about 15 minutes  what's creepy about the propofol  I'm laying down  and they go  enjoy your sleep  and then I start to say  what do you mean  but I only got the what part out  yep  oh wow  really  I think  that's my recollection  because I'm thinking  enjoy the sleep  what are you talking about  but so I go  I was going to say  what do you mean  and I never got  I never got the first word out  you tried some Dr. Steve  yeah the first time  I had a scope  I woke up  and swore  that they hadn't even 
[02:53:00]  done anything to me  I mean that's how amazing  oh you just wanted more  yeah  no you do  it was great  you do get that feeling  what  you're so fucking confused  and come out of it  you're like what  yeah  I just got the image  of a like lifeless body  they're just flopping around  shoving shit up its ass  you're just asleep  and then the doctor  showed me all the shit he did  I'm like what  when  when did you do this  just time  no concept of time  is what it comes down to  what Steve  I did my last colonoscopy 
[02:53:30]  without anesthesia  for that reason  because it was just  enjoyment  he was in the mirror  with a fucking dress  what a  what a creep  man  oh man it hurt too  and at one point  the scope got stuck  I guess I told you  this story already  and he  the guy said  well this is going to  hurt a little bit  and he just started  shoving foot  after foot  after foot  of that tube  up my ass  and then finally  it kicked loose  it kicked loose  like an anchor  yeah  I mean  I was this close  to just jumping off 
[02:54:00]  the table  with this damn tube  coming out of my head  what was the gerbil  holding the other end  you're dying  yeah the doctor  was fucking  whipping Steve's hiney  yelling  and the gerbil  was trying to back out  the gerbil  was creeped out  by the operation  and you did this  with no drugs  no drugs  wow  it was the chuck wagon  that fucking  pulled the fucking  tube up Steve's hiney  what are you angry at  well and they fill you up  with gas too  so you just fart  like an MF-er  when you're done  I just pulled up  my drawers  and went back to work 
[02:54:30]  but what are you angry at  that you would allow that  that's some angry issue  man  well see the thing is  I'm paid on pure productivity  in the hospital  oh so he had to be  taking two days off  to get over the anesthesia  really hurts my pocketbook  that's good  how am I doing doc  oh good  great  were you just farting  farting in front  of all your patients  of course he was  since Sirius is paying me  so much  I have to worry  about stuff  yeah I bet  all right  I thought they weren't

[02:59:00]  baby  disappointment  what does PFG stand for  pretty fucking great  that's right  oh good  I thought it was  no I was corrected  yeah  and you cut up  another one of his TV shows  pretty fucking god awful  how many markets  is he in  he's in 90  and then also  in London England  yeah 90 markets  and London England  I like when he  welcomed the new markets  he wouldn't name them  and he goes  you know who you are  you know who you are  cause I don't  cause there aren't any  safe to say  he's not in 90 markets 
[02:59:30]  safe to say  and not in England  that the only place  he's being broadcast  is in the pay slot  on Saturdays at midnight  on the My Network  in Manchester  New Hampshire  and there's the Lumpa Nation logo  what does Lumpa mean  I hope it's all people  with cancer tumors  Lumpa  yeah Lumpa  by the way  I'm going to sue  the logo  it's a cog  much like my stupid one  yes  no and it's got  my name Lumpa  and my last name  is shit  Lumpa  shit 
[03:00:00]  I think if you're a fan  of Rock 101  in New Hampshire  Manchester  you're a part  of the Lumpa Nation  alright it says  a Lumpa  created by New Hampshire's  Rock 101  is someone who works  hard every day  and has a boss  but needs a break  it's a blue collar  blue collar worker  I'm a Lumpa  but why Lumpa  it's like sometimes  you just  I'm a Lumpa  you turn a radio on 
[03:00:30]  after a hard day's work  and you just forget about it  I guess cause you're treated  like a Lumpa shit  yeah  so they're just saying  you're a Lumpa  what  I would assume  cause the boss man  it's the boss man  or an Oompa Lumpa  no I don't think  there's any Oompa  well you're treated  like a Lumpa  yes I'm sure  and then Scorch comes out  and they say  doopity douche  I've got another  bad bit  for you  here  Lumpa  doopity dee  you'll never get 
[03:01:00]  more than one  market ye  at one point  you saying  Scorch bad bits  reminded me  that he did  in an effort  to get people  to get tickets  to come see  PFG TV  live  in the studio audience  he announced  that he is bringing back  the wheel of meat  to television  wheel of meat  let's get into this  so the first clip here  is new  PFG TV  Scorch starts  PFG TV  with a little 
[03:01:30]  weather humor  yeah a little joke  to start things off  you know  wow  what a fine  fine night  for Scorch's  PFG TV  because the day  we are taping  this show  after having  something like  3,000 inches  of rain  the sun came out  today  you know what I mean  yeah it felt good man  and for the rest  of this here week  it's supposed to be  in the 60s  to near 70  which if you're  in New England  70  and at this time  of the year  yeah we deserve that 
[03:02:00]  freaking thumbs up  so mother nature  it's about time  you stop being  what I like to call  a shpag  thank you very much  you know  a shpag  which is like  a douche bag  thank you very much  shpag  a shpag  and he was back  a big laugh  he goes you know  what I like to call  now hold on  here it comes  a shpag  a shpag  shpag  shpag  shpag  douche  which I think  is douche bag  so you put  an apostrophe  shpag 
[03:02:30]  the apostrophe  takes care  of the do part  and then you're  just a shpag  it's kind of  a cool way  to say douche bag  and then you say  you know  when nobody laughs  because you're trying  to transition  that covers up  the silence  right  Scorch  freaking thumbs up  so mother nature  it's about time  you stop being  what I like to call  a shpag  thank you very much  you know  thank you very much  you know  people here  are calling Scorch  an agate  oh  that's not fair 
[03:03:00]  I would say  his show is  shpag  but that actually  works  it's just  some  hit  it's in a hit  that's not right  his show is a hit  that's it  let's not play anymore  you think that's  that's enough  yeah that's plenty  I mean that's only  the first 30 seconds  of PFG TV  well we find out  what's going on  with his crew  yeah I mean  because you know  and we get a taste  of the unmatchable  chemistry between  Nick and Scorch  well Jim said  last time  that he loved  the chemistry  between Scorch  and his man 
[03:03:30]  on the couch  Nick  right  and so right  here is a little  example  Scorch starts  the show  trying to display  the personalities  that he's brought  along with him  for the ride  and you get to see  exactly why  these guys  get to be on  television  alright let's  take a listen  you all know  our pal  the man of the  couch  give it up  for Nick  everybody say  hi Nick  hi Nick  no you can do  better than that  eight people  you don't get  everybody to yell  when there's only  eight people there  you should ask  everybody to keep  it down a little  you can hear 
[03:04:00]  individual voices  yes  never good  Nick  hi Nick  no you can do  better than that  everybody say  hi Nick  hi Nick  what's up  PFG Cypuls  see that's a little  bit better you know  and you all know  DJ Furious over there  right  wow what a crowd  you can hear  the individual claps  it seems like  you have a lot  of enemies today  Mr. Furious  he's very understated  today  that's what it is  you know  so what's up  with you guys  what's going on  with my crew  anything  what's up  with you guys  everything good  what's up

[03:05:00]  part of the show  now  Scorch always  I don't know  why he gets  this idea  that Nick's  gonna have  something for him  because Scorch  constantly  goes to Nick  for something  and every time  Nick says  no I'm not  gonna go there  is that tears  in your eyes  Sam's crying  first Nick  made this reaction  like whoa  and Scorch goes  oh good one  okay what's  your stories  and Nick says  well I'm not  gonna tell you  it's on my Facebook  and then Scorch  says oh you  have a Facebook  and Nick says 
[03:05:30]  yeah  and Scorch says  okay what's  your Facebook  and Nick says  I'm not gonna  tell you  I'm not gonna  tell you  so why does  it go to him  can we go  back to that  oompa loompa  loompa dee doo  let's count my  audience  one and two  doop-a-dee-dee  if you look  closely  you'll see  number three  oh no wait  that was a mirror  can you  can you  can we count  how many times  Scorch is let 
[03:06:00]  down in that  clip  yeah  Sam's on to  something  he's let  down  he realizes  Nick is a  fucking albatross  he realizes  the first one  was a dead  end so he  tried another  way  that's a  dead  end  I think  there's  three or  four dead  ends  why would  you pick  this guy  as your  couch guy  listen  he's just  trying to get  something from  Nick  how many times  has he fell  y'all know  our pal  the man on the  couch  give it up  for Nick  everybody say  hi Nick  everybody say  hi Nick 
[03:06:30]  what's up  that's a little  bit better  you know  and y'all know  DJ Furious  over there  right  whatever  it seems like  you have a lot  of enemies  today Mr.  Furious  he's very  understated  today  that's what  it is  you know  so what's up  with you guys  what's going on  with my crew  anything  what's up  with you guys  everything good  what's up  what's up  let's start  with Nick  these are always  the fun stories  what's up  in your life  oh no man  you gotta check  my Facebook page 
[03:07:00]  for that  dead end  number one  I'm not giving  it up  right now  no  you have  a Facebook page  I do  so what's  your Facebook  page address  so people can  do that  never mind  man  I'm not  gonna go there  I got so much  going on  I would need  so many dollars  in therapy  to get through it  so many  dead ends  he can't get  an answer  out of his  bestest guy  on the couch  that was the worst  unraveling of a joke  I would need  so many dollars  to get through it  so many dollars  to get through  the thingy  but like his whole  thing is like  oh wait till I tell you  and then Scorch 
[03:07:30]  is like what  and then he goes  nothing  every time  yeah  oh I got something  what is it  ah nothing  come on asshole  he keeps inviting  him back  to sit on the couch  sit on the couch  like he's Carson  oh fuck  yes  oh  fucking Jesus  alright Scorch  promotes that  he's getting back  in the dog cage  this year  for  Paws for a Cause  you remember  Paws for a Cause 
[03:08:00]  has a history  on this program  yes  he stinks  he's so bad  who Nick  camp finale  all of them  all the crew  Jack  so bad  yeah  Paws for a Cause  is the event  where Scorch  sleeps in his dog cage 
[03:08:30]  and one of our listeners  threw yellow paint on him  yeah  so he had to  stop doing  Paws for a Cause  for a while  he was so pissed  and he's finally  bringing it back  yeah  yeah  I hope no one  throws yellow paint  on him this year  oh please  it's a good cause  he's announcing  that he's back  in the cage  after a few years  not doing it  because of one  of our listeners  speaking of dogs  and animals  on June  was he even  talking about  dogs and animals  he previewed  that  and I hate to  spoil anything  but he previewed  that coming up 
[03:09:00]  later in the show  would be his segment  called  animals on drugs  sounds funny  and then he said  speaking of animals  and dogs  speaking of dogs  and animals  on June  the 6th  or the 7th  of this year  I will be going  back into the cage  for another week  yeah  thank you much  they're clapping  I think it means  prison  and he won't be  broadcasting  and basically  what I do 
[03:09:30]  is I live  in a cage  in a dog's cage  right  24 hours a day  I live in this cage  until I raise  a certain amount  of money  for local  animal shelters  and my goal  this year  is to raise  $30,000 cash  for the local  animals  she's lying  if everybody  watching right now  will put away  a buck a week  until the time  comes  by the time  I get into  the cage  when is it  2025  and we're going  to have our  30 grand  no problem  so  no problem  if everyone  watching  puts away  a buck a week  until when 
[03:10:00]  June 6th  he'll have  $30,000  we could do  some quick  math here  bullshit  if every  listener he  has  does that  he's still  short by  $28,000  yeah he'll  at the end  of the week  he'll lie  and say  he has  $30,000  yeah we hit  the mark  but you're  the real  heroes  you're the  people that  did it  you know  I just  didn't  the cage  poured yellow  paint on  he would need  3,333 
[03:10:30]  listeners  3,330  no way  no  he's got  that  he doesn't  even have  the 30  no  he doesn't  that's done  well he has  three  so now he  needs  3,330  yeah  I'll turn my  mic off  that's right man  I like the fact  you got up  even though you  humiliated yourself  and stopped the  show  at least you  went up there  and took a  swing at it  trap dog  yeah  good trap dog  exactly  PFG continues  with weird  news  I know you  guys love  the weird 
[03:11:00]  news  in the meantime  though why don't  we get right  into our first  segment that we  like to call  weird news  some are on  and some deranged  stories that are  very strange  weird news  oh so you  thought getting  texting or texting  while driving  was bad  23 year old  Rachel Allen  of London  England  led police  on a high  speed chase  rather they  caught up to her  they found out  why she was  acting so erratically  she was shooting  up heroin  as she was  driving  okay  they only 
[03:11:30]  stopped her  for the  texting  and as it  turns out  she was  texting her  friend saying  I'm shooting  up heroin  and the cops  and the cops  are after me  what am I  gonna do  so obviously  she can  predict the  future  because she's  now facing  10 years  in prison  so good  for her  why predict  the future  none of it  made any sense  what does that  mean  none of it  made any sense  obviously she  can predict  the future  and why would  she text her  friend  I'm high  on heroin  I'm doing  heroin  and no one  has ever  texted that 
[03:12:00]  no  I'm driving  and shooting  how do you  do that  by the way  he described  the news story  and then  instead of  writing a joke  he said that  she was texting  the news story  that he had  just described  right  so she predicted  the future  he said she  predicted  the future  oh my god  he's off  his rocker  he's got more  weird news  weird news  and then  the next three  stories I have  are great  because they're  all about  passed out  drunk people  and we all  have been there 
[03:12:30]  and or know  some people  that do that  so the next  time you passed  out drunk  behind the  wheel of a  stolen car  take your  punishment  and leave  it at that  this guy  from Cincinnati  Ohio  named Damon  Bailey  he was getting  his fine  handed to him  at court  he looked at  the arresting  officer and  said I'm  going to kill  you  no more  drunk driving  charges for  Damon  he's in jail  for 13 years  for threatening  the life of  the cops  so that's  that stupid  yeah you know  what I mean  no one gets  13 years for 
[03:13:00]  saying I'm  going to kill  you  no I mean  it's probably  I mean  I'm sure  he's got a lot  of details  going on  yeah he's a  fucking moron  Danny popped  up the video  of him  and that  studio is  hysterical  it's great  EG Allen  had a fucking  better stage  when he was  shitting bananas  all over the  fucking place  did you notice  the PFG laptop  oh yeah yeah  it's fantastic  it's terrific  he's got an  uplifting story  to end  weird news  and we have 
[03:13:30]  one more  drunk driving  story here  you go  another drunk  story not a  good idea if  you're drunk  driving and you  stick your head  out the window  to get sick  right  22 year old  this is an  awful story  I think I've  seen this  22 year old  Steven campaign  of Clearwater  Florida  didn't want to  get anything  on his car  so when he  put his head  out the window  as he was  driving to get  his head  really out the  window  and he hit  a light post  and he basically  got decapitated  as he was driving  yeah  good news is  bad news is 
[03:14:00]  he did get  decapitated  the good news  is he got  no vomit  or anything  on the car  so it all  worked out  well  there you go  that's today's  start with the  weird news  weird news  yeah  what's that  clippy play  well that's a  jingle  a little  like jingle  thing that he's  had at least  in Syracuse  because he used  to use it all  the time when I  was working with  him  the ha ha ha  thing  it just goes  you are an 
[03:14:30]  idiot  oh my god  you love the  Scorch don't you  I love him so  much  he used to  play that clip  and I would  just laugh  and he thought  I was laughing  at how funny  he was  and you were  just laughing  of course I  was  you were such  a wise ass  Scorch starts a  new segment called  animals on drugs  he starts with a  picture of a cat  next to a bag of  weed  yeah this animals  on drugs  it's like 
[03:15:00]  remember the last  time we listened  to PFG TV  his segment was  called dating  site disasters  where he showed  pictures of people  from dating sites  right  this is called  animals on drugs  where he shows  pictures of animals  who may or may  not be on drugs  and we have to  guess  no  he just  he shows the  picture  and then he  makes  this is pretty  much  tissues for your  fucking tears  this is pretty  much like  the sensation  that's sweeping  the nation  about cats  on the internet  right 
[03:15:30]  except it's  pictures of  animals who  might be on drugs  and then he  says things  about them  alright let's  listen  why don't we  talk about  animals on drugs  this is something  and I love my  animals you know  what I mean  so it's nothing  bad about animals  but a lot of  people have  taken animals  pictures of  animals while  they're on drugs  for instance  we've got our  first one  this thing right  here this is  called  feline fun  okay  feline fun  now the worst  part is  honest to god 
[03:16:00]  that lucky  SOB cat  look at the  grass in there  look at that  butt in that  bag  come on now  even Joe in the  booth is like  yeah man I hear  you that looks  like some good  stuff  and the cat  is like saying  I think I know  where you got  that from  what's that  funny smell  how much you  think that  stuff caused  Nick  I know it's  not a funny  sound  I'm not even  going to  venture to guess  Nick  I'm not even  an educated  guess  Nick still  hasn't  contributed  the best part  you have to  play that  clip again 
[03:16:30]  because the  best part  is at the  end  where he  realizes  that Nick  has failed  him again  because he  says I  thought you  were going  to give  an educated  guess  on that  one  I'm not  even going  to try  to help  you out  my man  on the  couch  here's my  man  I think I  know where  you got  that from  what's that  funny smell  how much  do you think  that stuff  caused Nick  I'm not  even going  to venture  to guess  I figured  you'd give  us an  educated  guess  on that  Nick 
[03:17:00]  is just  laughing  at him  holy  shit  what the  fuck  is up  what a  disaster  Nick  is valueless  on that  show  he doesn't  want to  give any  opinions  he doesn't  want to  answer any  questions  he doesn't  want to  lead Scorch  into any  conversation  he wants  to stop  Scorch  from all  conversation  unbelievable  the next  is a picture  of a dog  that looks  happy  so this is  what Scorch  has to say  about it  go on  for the next  one  this one  is basically 
[03:17:30]  just  look at  the dog  is high  and he's  happy about  it  look at  he said  look at  me  I am  baked  the worst  part is  he's a male  dog  and he has  to be high  because his  masters put  a little  heart tag  on him  it's like  everybody's  going to  think I'm  a gay  dog  I don't  like that  man  I'm a  straight  dog  but I'm  hot  holy  shit  holy  shit  wow 
[03:18:00]  because the  dog is  high  so he's  you know  we got  it  okay  I didn't  know  because  you guys  weren't  laughing  this is  from  PFG  TV  Scorch's  PFG  TV  is always  looking for  new  family members  do you  want your  company  to be  featured  in  millions  of  homes  email  for  details  millions  of  homes  email  for  details  meat  whistle  writes  his  parents  are  listening  and  scorching  his birth  certificate  right now  and  Caroline 
[03:18:30]  man  writes  Nick  is  awesome  is  Nick  a  plant  what  do you  mean  a  plant  I  think  actually  a  plant  like  a  physical  plant  a  fern  let's  say  hi  to  Dave  in  Massachusetts  Dave  Nick  on  that  show  is  like  Marvin  from  Pulp  Fiction  and  should  be  treated  and  disposed  of  as such  I don't  know why  that  didn't  get a  laugh  that's  blind  Dave  too  man  you  should  laugh  at  everything  blind 
[03:19:00]  Dave  says  oh  is  he  should  run  for  governor  he  shows  a  picture  of  a  dog  next  to  some  snacks  and  this  is  what  Scorch  next  to  snacks  on  PFG  TV  this  next  one's  really  good  one  and  looks  almost  like  one  of  my  dogs  too  this  next  one's  like  anybody  got  the  munchies  I'll  help  you  out  munchies  and  what  are  they  they  like  everlasting  gobstoppers  or something  so  the  munchies  with the  dog  and  we  have  one  more  year  oh 
[03:19:30]  fuck  man  in a  disaster  loop  that  was  Nick's  cue  to  think  of  something  funny  and  Nick  just  goes  yeah  that's  absolutely  what  so far  that's  what  he's  added  to  the  show  it's  a good  show  this guy  goes  from  topic  to  topic  he  rips  yeah  Nick's  good  you think  it's  good  it's  great  yeah  because  Nick  Nick's  crazy  man  you don't  know what  that guy  is  going to  do  yeah  this  watch is  good  get the  animal  drugs  the 
[03:20:00]  animal  is  probably  high  as  a  kite  his  comments  really  make  the  bit  right  because  I'm  sure  and we  can't  see  the  pictures  but  the  way  he  describes  it  and  everything  I  get  a  crystal  clear  picture  and  then  the  comedy  comes  that's  what  I 
[03:20:30]  mercifully  ends  the  segment  with  an  overexposed  picture  of a  cat  sleeping  next  to  a  bong  I  think  that's  what  it was  it was  very hard  to see  because the  picture was  overexposed  it was  a bad picture  about the  cat next to  the bong  and this  is a really  good one  too  look at  this  the cat  you know  what I'm  saying  that ladies 
[03:21:00]  and gentlemen  is what  you call  a passed  out pussy  cat  and there  you go  animals  on drugs  as we  celebrate  photoshop  is 20  years old  this week  imagine  the guys  invented photoshop  20 years  old this  week  so  we're going  to be  doing a lot  more stuff  like that  and  a lot  more fun  with  just  different  types  of things  that we're  looking for  you know  I mean  on the  show  on the  show  I forgot  he loves 
[03:21:30]  the  anniversary  and the  all that  stuff  he wants  he wants  on the  air  he said  he got  into this  kick of  doing top  10 lists  I think  I've told  you guys  about some  of his  lists  he got  on the  air  and said  tomorrow  is the  anniversary  of the  invention  of the  jungle gym  and so  off the  air  his sidekick  said  I mean  if you  really want  to talk  about the  anniversary  of the  jungle gym  we should  do something  stupid 
[03:22:00]  like have  our  stunt guy  do something  on a  jungle gym  like on a  playground  and Scorch  goes no  we're going  to do the  top 10  gyms list  including  Jim Belushi  and other  gyms  and his  sidekick  Paulie was  trying to  figure out  why he  would do  that  and then  Scorch  left the  room  and I  had to  inform  Paulie  that Scorch  had already  told me  earlier  that the  next day  was not  at all  the  anniversary  of the  jungle gym  he just  wanted an  excuse  holy shit 
[03:22:30]  Scorch is  a compulsive  liar  he's just  a compulsive  liar  Wayne in  Boston  millions of  homes  Scorch's  PFG TV  fan page  on Facebook  yeah  three  hundred  wow  twenty one  fans  and according  to his  Facebook  it says  according to  the PFG TV  Facebook  Scorch is  giving away  pizza  to get  people  in his  studio 
[03:23:00]  audience  so he  gives away  pizza  he promotes  that on  the air  that there  is a  free pizza  for the  audience  members  and then  he has to  mention it  several times  on the  show  and he  also  he takes  his sponsor  breaks  millions  of homes  he gets  into  right  where he  informs  the sponsors  that they're  part of the  PFG family  if they'll  buy time  on his  show  yeah  and he  just talks  about  tattoo shops  and things  like that  but he's  obviously  swindled  swindled  I mean he's  just pocketing  the money  fuck 
[03:23:30]  well that's  fantastic  I can't get  enough  yeah we'll have  to get another  one  I only wish  Colin was here  because he loves  Scorch  next week we'll get  another one  we'll get another  one for next week  I mean yeah I have  a source now  in Manch Vegas  that is sending me  these  every week  we won't miss  an episode  thank god  he just taped  this  this was taped  March 20  this was aired  March 28th  of this year  does he do  this on purpose  no  someone has  to be  being forced  to do this  no 
[03:24:00]  yeah  you know  this is his  big break  no he's not  being ironic  or being bad  on purpose  or anything  he thinks  did he  that he is  the shit  did he actually  say  the guys  that invented  Photoshop  are 20 years  old today  I think he said  they started  making it  when they were  born  yeah  yeah they  turned 20  that's scorch  he probably  doesn't exactly  know what  Photoshop is  either  because none  of the pictures  they showed  had any  Photoshopping  involved  no no no 
[03:24:30]  it's just a  picture  I didn't need it  I just needed  to use the  word Photoshop  so I could  do a thing  on camera  people  they can  take pictures  it's Kodak  the family  Polaroid  top 10  cameras  Panaflex  he once  said  that he  used toothpicks  every day  it was his  thing  that was one  of his  visual things  that he  always had  a toothpick  in his mouth  and he  told me  and Pauly  that since  he uses  toothpicks  every day  he writes 
[03:25:00]  he told us  that he  writes off  $5,000  worth of  toothpicks  on his  taxes  on his  taxes  I wish  Smith and  Wesson  made toothpicks  how many  toothpicks  would that  be  well we  did the  math  and there  was no  feasible  way  that  it's  gotta be  a million  toothpicks  a box  that includes  hundreds  if not  a thousand  toothpicks  cost $2  unless every  day just  shoves a  full box  of toothpicks  in his mouth  and walks  around looking  all silly  like the  cigarette guy  in the  Guinness Book  of Records  and then he  spits them  out a second  later and  puts another  box in 
[03:25:30]  there's no  way  $5,000  in toothpicks  no  or is he  just a  compulsive  liar  well there's  a couple  things going  on  Nick in  Virginia  writes  he should  give the  audience  free  pistols  and  pizza  and Jeff  in Boston  believe it or  not the  my TV station  he's on  is available  all over  the Boston  market  I get it  where I am  south of  Boston  I don't know  how much  he's paying  for it  but it  starts off  with the  following  is a paid  program  there's a big  difference between  how many  homes get  the station 
[03:26:00]  and how many  people watch  the show  because you know  I'm sure  NBC  when they had  Seinfeld on  you know  it was very  good  but just  because you're  on NBC  doesn't mean  every show  was a hit  not every  single show  on the network  was Seinfeld  worthy  Saturday at  midnight  probably did  not get the  same ratings  as Seinfeld  and anytime  you see  paid programming  click  you're off  and PFG  is running  opposite  SNL  so if you  want comedy  on a Saturday  night  you either  go SNL 
[03:26:30]  or PFG TV  I think PFG TV  Saturday night  lame  I go PFG  every time  Sam  I would  every fucking  time  I got them  all on DVD  now  hey well  whoa  what's that  oh my goodness  wow what the fuck  was that  I don't know  it's still  my left phone  is dead  mine too  is your left  one dead  yeah  that was  fucking weird  Jesus Christ  did I just  lose my hearing  my left ear phone  is not working  mine's gone  I can't hear  anything out of  the left ear  well that can't  be our individual  settings 
[03:27:00]  that means  one of the amps  went  had some kind  of a ear problem  at the same time  yeah we all  had an ear problem  oh Mars  is looking very  confused  Mars  something happened  to our headphones  all of a sudden  there was this squeak  yeah  and a squeal  and then a little  pop  and then the left  headphone went dead  in all of our  headphones  I don't have anything  in my left  it had a weird sound  you know that sound  a small piglet makes  when you put a firecrack  on his asshole  yes  Mars I'm not getting  anything in my left 
[03:27:30]  headphone  Mars  it's the left  headphone  unless I put it on  backwards  and then it's  the right one  right but then  you could flip it  around  now it's the left  one  did anyone hear  that  wow that was weird  I know I thought  I was having a stroke  that's the way  you just  I jumped like  ah medical problem  how does it sound  out there  is it only coming  out of one channel  or  I hope it's coming  out of both  maybe it's not  our headphones  maybe it's the  entire station  that's what I'm  thinking  that'd be weird  we are on the air  it's fine  it's fine  yeah my headphones 
[03:28:00]  are working perfectly  I didn't even hear  what you guys  what  oh well then  go fuck yourself  alright  wow  trap dog's got  both ears  I can still hear  out of my ear  when I put the  headphone off of it  well you guys  here  in this thing  get all right  channel  so if you're  just listening  you'd hear  everything  but  well  alright we'll  continue  that was weird  Sam while we  have you in here  what's this backstage  E-Rock has a  Spice Girls doll  oh there's some 
[03:28:30]  investigating going on  oh no  what did he do  Spice Girls dolls  what did he do  and there was a  Spice Girls doll  does he just think  up shit for us  to make fun of  does he look at  sneakers and go  I'm going to buy  those because I  want to be made  fun of  okay we got to  go back to the  toothpick thing  ready  ready from  Wackbag did the  math on that one  wow his math is  really off this  Scorch  OB Scorch would  have to for him  to use $5,000  worth of toothpicks  in a year he  would have to use 
[03:29:00]  2.5 million  toothpicks in a year  which means he  would have to  use about  6,849 toothpicks  a day  6,849  toothpicks  a day  a day  to write off  $5,000 worth  of toothpicks  well up to  7,000 per day  right  he didn't use  he never used  I never  so if you're  7,000 per day  how many is that  per hour  wow  and just waking  hours because I  assume he's not  sleeping and changing  so he always said 
[03:29:30]  that he didn't  sleep a lot  and so it  didn't matter  that he had a  giant hole  in his mattress  Jonathan says  it's 6.1 million  toothpicks  oh  so I don't know  what math is right  it's a lot of  toothpicks  yeah  so what's up with  E-Rock and the  Spice Girls doll  well I mean  I was just in his  office yesterday  and you saw  Spice Girls  and sitting next  to his desk  was Mel B  aka Scary Spice  in 12 inch  form  so what  like  and it's  it's his 
[03:30:00]  it's not just  something  is it in the  box  like a  collector's  item  it's in the  box  alright let's  let's play  this  can we get  E-Rock  of course  as we play  this  and now  backstage  with ONA  here is  Primetime  Sam Roberts  I'm Primetime  Sam Roberts  the backstage  team was  researching  scoops in the  ONA office  and stumbled  upon something  interesting  an old Spice  Girl doll  positioned firmly  next to  producer E-Rock's  desk  obviously belonging 
[03:30:30]  to the sex  bagel himself  after his usual  hearty breakfast  E-Rock was firmly  planted to the  toilet  so we first  went to some  ONA staffers  to get some  information  on the doll  hey Troy Kwan  there is a  Spice Girls doll  in E-Rock's  office right by  his desk  doesn't surprise  me  it doesn't?  no  why?  well I mean  collects wrestling  dolls and has  fake wrestling  belts and  but the Spice Girls  and wrestling are  two different 
[03:31:00]  things  not too far  apart  it's a  it's a Barbie  doll  honestly  honestly  are you surprised?  no  exactly  hey D-boy  I just found  a Spice Girls  doll  right next to  E-Rock's desk  is there any  justification  that you could  see in a man  owning a Spice Girls  doll at this  point in his  life?  none whatsoever  club show to  Kenny  I just found  a Spice Girls  doll  next to  E-Rock's desk  obviously  belonging to  him 
[03:31:30]  is it  com-stained?  I'm not sure  do you think  it should be  or  yeah why  wouldn't it be?  could you see  any justification  for owning one?  yes  which is what?  next question  what's the  justification?  wait who are we  talking about?  pussycat dolls?  focus Kenny  focus  obviously with  no direction  to go in  we had to  confront the  Nagel man  himself  to get some  kind of  explanation  so E-Rock  how's it going? 
[03:32:00]  it's going good  Sam  what's the deal  with the  Spice Girls  doll next to  your desk?  well  clearing out  my place  I have a bunch  of toys  and other stuff  that I've had  saved in boxes  for years  and that's  one of the  things I'm  getting rid of  at what point  in your life  did you think  a Spice Girls  doll was  necessary?  it was given  to me in  1997  as a birthday  gift  because when  I guess  that's when  they were really  big  and I said 
[03:32:30]  that I liked  Scary Spice  are you glad  you held on  to it for  all these  years?  actually I  haven't opened  it since I  moved up from  Florida  so when I  cut open that  box and saw it  I was like  oh I can  get rid of that  you thought  it was something  though that once  you moved  you had to  take with you  for sure?  there's no way  you could leave  it behind?  well I brought  everything up  because there's  no reason you  would have  maybe thrown  it out or  given it away  down in Florida  you had to  move it with  you  yeah that  doesn't make  sense either  I don't know  why I brought  it  what's your  favorite song 
[03:33:00]  the Spice Girls  did?  the wannabe  song  how does it  go?  I'll tell you  what I want  what I really  really want  and then it  goes I want  a zig-a-zig-zig  I want a  zig-a-zig  I'll bet  you do  sex bagel  I guess we  really shouldn't  be surprised  who knows  what the next  skeleton will be  to come out of  E-Rock's seemingly  endless closet  whatever it is  I'm sure it will  leave his family  and loved ones  ashamed and  embarrassed  if you want to  be my lover  I'm primetime  Sam Roberts  and this has been 
[03:33:30]  Backstage  with ONA  wow Sam  oh my god  I like that  I like that  E-Rock knows  the words  to the Spice Girls  yeah yeah  or tried to  make it seem  like he didn't  but knew him  completely  he answered  very quickly  E-Rock comment  I had nothing  much to comment  about  I had it  mayo spice  you didn't get 
[03:34:00]  that with your  pocket money  it was a gift  no it was a gift  back in college  that's a horrible  gift  but he wanted it  and he saved it  yeah  I didn't want it  but I did save it  why would you save it  if you didn't want it  I don't know  I just never threw it out  this is fishy  fishy  yeah  well it's gone now  but  he's  Spice Girls guy  that's why I was  thinking  the Paul Abdul song  got tired  we stopped playing it  every time he comes  in the studio  so he might have 
[03:34:30]  a favorite Spice Girls  song that he wanted  to play  that's not a bad idea  you know  sure why not  do wannabe  Iraq  could you sing  this for us  cause I know  you know the words  can we start over  give me the lyrics  I can do it  no I remember the hook  I don't remember the  you should do  no I don't  you remember it  you sing  you wanna just do  the hook for us  sure  alright I'll play it again
