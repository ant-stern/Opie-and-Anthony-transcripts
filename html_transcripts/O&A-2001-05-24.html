<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of a Yankees/Red Sox game, punctuated by jokes about the Red Sox's poor performance and a trivia question referencing Hitler.  A French chef, Mark, called in to promote his restaurant, leading to a digression on the perceived inferiority of French coffee.  The upcoming show appearance at a concert featuring Green Day and Marilyn Manson was mentioned by a caller, Joe.  Further calls followed, one from Dan about a deli with numerous coffee flavors, and another regarding a deli worker, Jeff Norris, known for his excessive cologne.  Norris himself then called in, resulting in a lengthy, humorous, and insult-laden segment about his cologne, physique, and a near-chokehold incident.

The conversation then pivoted to a cab driver who returned a valuable cello, initially receiving a small reward before complaining to the media for more money. This sparked a debate on the ethics of payment for returning lost property, referencing a Brady Bunch episode.  Announcements were made regarding upcoming appearances at Sip, Sip, Shipper Steen's in Sanford, Connecticut, and an update was given on a legal case involving a cab driver and a police officer.

A substantial portion of the show focused on a detailed caricature of the Opie and Anthony studio, created by artists Adam and Greg. The hosts described the artwork, which depicted show personalities and included explicit imagery referencing the Olsen twins and a movie poster for "The Soul of Nigger Charlie." Adam and Greg were in studio, and callers compared the drawing to the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  The discussion then shifted to Earl, who was late for a sticker distribution event, prompting numerous calls providing (often inaccurate) location updates.  A humorous story about a 100-year-old man assaulting his much younger girlfriend was recounted, followed by updates on Stinky's pedophile roommate, Timothy McVeigh's execution, and a Vermont senator's party switch.  The segment concluded with discussions on the death penalty, political scandals, and a review of BMW Films.  Lewis Black, a guest from *The Daily Show*, participated in these discussions, offering his characteristically cynical humor on various political figures and events.

Lewis Black remained a guest for a significant portion of the show.  The conversation covered energy policy, referencing the Hanukkah miracle, the size of SUVs and monster trucks, government energy initiatives, and criticisms of past presidential administrations (Clinton and Bush). Black shared personal anecdotes, including his dislike of golf, his preference for "really good food" and sex, and a childhood experience in Saudi Arabia witnessing public executions.  Highly offensive language and crude jokes were used during a discussion of Reverend Al Sharpton's imprisonment in Puerto Rico, followed by sarcastic comments about the movie *Pearl Harbor*.  A significant, often interrupted, segment focused on Black's attempt to tell a story about a children's charity performance featuring Gracie, a singer with prosthetic legs, whose performance incorporated religious themes.  The show included commercial breaks and mentions of sponsors, including New Jersey Cure auto insurance and Sam Adams beer (the latter prompting a humorous anecdote about a Sam Adams executive's request regarding future promotions).  A poster featuring the Opie and Anthony show cast, notably excluding Black, was also discussed.

Further segments with Lewis Black featured a fantastical golf story involving Jesus, a discussion of Gracie Rosenberg (a real person who overcame severe injuries and maintained her faith), and a rambling, increasingly bizarre and sexually explicit fictional story about Kathie Lee Gifford that Black repeatedly regretted.  Black expressed frustration with distracting sound effects.  A graphic advertisement for "Ultimate V," a sexual enhancement product, further contributed to his agitation.  A listener call-in segment titled "What Did We Learn?" featured humorous and often crude observations about the show and its guests, with numerous sexual references and jokes targeting Black, along with further mentions of Stinky and his pedophile roommate.  The show concluded with banter among the hosts and promotion of Black's upcoming shows.

[00:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's exactly what's going to happen.  You know, there's a lot of stuff we can't talk about, but...  Don't worry.  We need to leave in New York.  We're not leaving New York.  That is a guarantee, my friend.  Guaranteed.  Okay, cool.  We're just going up there for a fine concert.  We're going to see what?  Green Day, Marilyn Manson, Aerosmith, Black Crows, Fat Boy Slim.  What else, Ben?  Whatever, Ben.  I said Marilyn Manson, right?  It's cantric, live, tricky, Coldplay. 
[00:05:30]  What the hell else?  Probably.  There's so many.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, it's going to be great.  It blows another station's little concert out of it.  It's a station with Ampick.  Yeah, it's going to be a good time.  I'm sorry.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, guys, we're going to talk about coffee.  I got a deli by me that has 20 different flavors of coffee, and I'm looking around.  Did you have any coffee-flavored coffee?  They look at me like they have nine eggs.  Coffee-flavored coffee.  No, I can totally relate with you, Dan.  Just give me a cup of coffee. 
[00:06:00]  I don't need French vanilla, bean, African, wubu.  All I need is coffee.  Whatever.  Right.  All right.  Thank you, Shady.  We smoked up.  I remember there was this deli I used to go to when I was working for a living.  When I'd go for breakfast.  When I was working for a living.  Yeah, well, at least you're honest.  This ain't work.  No.  When I would go to the deli and get my egg sandwiches and stuff before my hard day of the work started  at noon, I'd get the coffee, you know?  And there was always this guido out on Long Island that had the cologne on his hands. 
[00:06:30]  Like he'd cologne himself up.  And then he'd pop the top on your coffee cup.  And every time you went to take a sip, you'd smell guido's cologne.  It's like, what the hell?  Someone ought to tell the guy to wash your hands and don't put the cologne on when you're  snapping the lid on top of people's coffee.  You lift it up to your mouth and your nose goes right against the lid.  You're like, now I've got to smell guido.  And his name?  Jeff Norris.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, you know, you're absolutely right. 
[00:07:00]  And if he calls, I think we'll be doing him a service.  I was going to bring it up yesterday.  Jeff Norris came in, gorilla boy, to say hi.  He shook all our hands.  He has cologne on his hands for some reason.  Somebody tell me why.  He's got to lighten up on the cologne.  He came in and like a cologne cloud followed him yesterday.  You can tell when he's here before you even see him.  Because of Jeff Norris, I was smelling man scent on my hands.  You don't want man scent.  It's worse than a stripper smell.  Worse than stripper smell because at least that came from a chick. 
[00:07:30]  I've got gorilla boy's man scent on my hands.  And then you walk around and all of a sudden you get a little waft of it and you're thinking  of the man.  You're thinking of him.  I don't want to think of him.  I don't want to think of Guido Deli guy.  You know?  Get your cologne off.  Matt.  Yeah.  What's up, Matt?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I was calling about the Hitler birthday thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was born April 20th, 1889.  It was 1889.  So that would make him a little older.  29? 
[00:08:00]  29.  29, right.  Wow.  So Hitler was 29 when the Red Sox.  Yeah, World War I was still going on.  That's better then, right?  Then?  Hitler was only, uh, he was 29.  Last time the Red Sox won the World Series.  They were still fighting with biplanes.  We're in space now.  They were fighting wars with biplanes.  Hey, Jeff.  Hi.  Jeff Norris, everyone.  Oh, Jeff.  Can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  Rick, go after yourself. 
[00:08:30]  Whatever, Jeff.  Yeah, whatever.  You know I love you.  Jeff.  Why?  Jeff.  First of all, how come no one says nothing when I'm there, number one?  Because you're a big guy and you're a big guy.  Big guy don't mean crap in this world, but nothing.  One time you were demonstrating a chokehold on me.  I swear to God, I went on vacation the next day.  Stop it, man.  And two days, I swear to you, my girlfriend will attest to this.  Two days later, I went, son of a bitch, Norris, I can't swallow. 
[00:09:00]  Come on.  Like, my throat hurts.  When you did that move where you choked someone out.  You asked me to show you.  I said, okay, show me, but watch out.  You put my throat in the crook of your arm.  And then you do another thing where he gets his other arm on the back of your head.  And for a split second, he went, like, like, tweaked it.  And I thought I was going to die.  I didn't even apply it.  Jeff.  I know.  You didn't have to.  But two days later, I was like, no. 
[00:09:30]  Jeff, you manhandled us.  Yeah.  I do not.  You and your karate tattoos, right?  Oh, wait, gorilla.  Don't choke me out.  Terrible being known as a bruiser.  Well, you know.  One of the nicest guys on a circuit.  If the karate tattoos fit.  Norton's more violent than me.  Yeah, but Norton's not scary looking.  Norton's only violent to small children.  I don't know what that.  Norton is psychotic, but we laugh at him.  What's he going to do?  And he doesn't have the balls to have karate tattoos on his body. 
[00:10:00]  Norris.  Norris, Jeff.  All we're saying, like.  Well, let me explain that.  You don't need as much cologne as you can.  No, you ask.  No, no, no.  I don't even care that he wears cologne and all that.  But I don't understand why it's all over your hands when you shake our hands.  You know why?  I'm going to tell you why.  The guy who parked my truck in the basement downstairs below, you can ask you, make it Mike.  Yeah.  You know what?  I'm going to even explain.  No, right.  Rick's laughing.  Rick's laughing.  I'm listening.  Wait, Jeff.  Rick's laughing.  He's making us laugh. 
[00:10:30]  You know I love you, Jeff.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm counting that.  No.  First of all, if anyone needs a beating, it's Rick.  I don't understand what happened to me.  I mean, Rick.  I don't understand.  Can you demonstrate that choke hold on Rick next time you come in?  He will be dead.  All right, Jeff.  I want to hear the story.  What happened with the cologne?  The bottle broke in the truck.  Holy jeez.  Did you step on the brake and it was in the glass compartment and it flew through the back  window?  That old gag.  Did I reach enough abuse level to get a plug yet? 
[00:11:00]  Uh, no.  When you explain the cologne on the hand thing.  So the cologne broke in your truck?  No, no, no.  Because usually I...  Jeff, honestly, I think yesterday wasn't the first time I smelled cologne on my hand after  shaking your hand.  Rick, you laugh like you got sodomized by a friend.  You got me.  Yeah, you laugh like you just took it up the A from Marco.  Oh, Billy. 
[00:11:30]  Jeff.  What?  I'm just thinking that before you come to see us, you're kind of just, you know, putting  the brute in your hands.  Brute?  And pop it on your face.  Are you like 12?  What is it?  High karate?  Hi.  I'm looking at the phone.  I'm just waiting to see the word Voss on one of the phone lines.  Oh, no.  I can't even...  Don't even mention that.  I'd love to see him come forward and maybe contribute to this. 
[00:12:00]  But it broke, you're saying?  Yeah.  All right.  It broke, Opie.  It happens.  It happens.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm not going to argue with him.  He's scary.  Stop that with the scary.  You guys are giving me a bad rep.  Nah.  I do it as a sport.  I'm no different than a guy that plays baseball.  It's a sport.  That's the one I chose.  Just beating people up.  No, it's a sport.  You kick ass, man.  It's a lot.  It doesn't mean nothing.  You guys are painting me like I'm some tough jerk-off, and I'm not. 
[00:12:30]  I couldn't imagine anyone beating you up.  Like, I can't imagine.  You see how crooked my nose is?  I've been beaten up before.  It's probably because you hit people with it.  Like, I couldn't imagine anyone hitting you.  Like, I'm going to beat you up with my nose.  You know what?  You just pummeled the guy.  Hey, Vinny.  Yo.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  I just wanted to add my two cents, because I feel like I'm somewhat of a personal friend  to Mr. Norris over there.  Hey, Vinny the Racer.  What's up, brother?  Well, I've got to say this.  This guy, all right, maybe he looks like one of the baldwin brothers, but let me say, 
[00:13:00]  let me finish.  This guy for...  Vinny.  What happened to Vinny?  Vinny.  Vinny's got a cell phone from 1985.  Just like everything else he's got.  Tommy.  Yeah, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I've been in the brokerage a couple of times when Otto and George were there and  Gorilla Boys opened up for him.  He's a big guy in all, but he came walking by our table, the front table, and he sounded 
[00:13:30]  like a bitch, man.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  You guys, everyone has balls on the radio.  It's amazing.  Absolutely.  It's so...  You know, this guy sounds like a...  Every person I met at the brokerage is cool, but it's so amazing.  The balls people grow on a telephone.  It's like the size of Epcot Center.  Not everyone can be stupid enough to mount off and make your face.  Jesus Christ.  I'm not like that, man.  I don't...  I don't do that. 
[00:14:00]  I don't...  And, you know, not for nothing, you're a 40 guy, and I'll be back to see you the first  Wednesday this month.  We'll talk about it then.  Okay.  Take it easy, guys.  Jeff's happy.  He's just got a plug in.  Was that the plug you wanted to do, Jeff?  No.  Rast was all this week in West Orange.  There you go.  All this weekend?  Yeah.  All this...  Last night till Sunday.  Angel?  Yeah.  Cool.  Tony, open the effing door, Tony.  It's pretty cool. 
[00:14:30]  Cool.  All right, Jeff.  We're just messing with you.  I know.  I know, because you all love me.  Of course.  Yeah, come on.  We love you.  We learned that from the comedians.  Hey.  You guys...  Hey, Jeff.  Before my showtime, guys.  Yeah.  Hello?  Yeah, go.  Yeah.  Hey, Jeff.  I just want to say, as big as tough as this guy is, I tried to say before, the sweetest guy  on the planet Earth.  This guy is unbelievable.  He's a sweetheart.  He's a nice guy for somebody who can kick anybody's ass.  I love Jeff Norris.  That's all I really have to say.  You love Chuck Norris? 
[00:15:00]  I love Chuck Norris.  Oh.  Jeff Norris.  Okay.  Hey, and one more thing.  Hey, what's going on with that shortboard game?  I've been at the back of the game for three times a week.  Meditations don't work.  Nothing works here.  I didn't even have to say, man.  Then you better have to email him, because you can't get a few back to a computer.  All right, Vinny.  Thank you.  And Jeff, thank you.  All right.  All right.  I love you, Chuck Norris.  Wow.  Vinny kissing Jeff's ass.  Look at that, gorilla boy. 
[00:15:30]  All right.  Oh, my God.  Right there, a comedy team only surpassed by, I don't know, Caesars Cove Resort.  The comic head there.  All right.  We've got to take our first break.  Louis Black is coming in today.  Nice.  We're doing a wow sticker stop in Sanford, Connecticut, I bought it, right?  Is Earl, um, did Earl leave already?  Yep.  Earl in Connecticut today, gang, at Sip, Ship, Shipper Steen's.  And that's Sip, Sip, Sip, in Sanford, Connecticut. 
[00:16:00]  He'll be there at 430.  Do we have the exact address?  Something about I-95, go down a block, turn left on.  Let's see.  What are the directions?  All right.  955 East Main Street in Stanford, Connecticut.  Sip, Sip, Shipper Steen's with Earl as he hands out the wow bumper stickers at 430.  This is our first appearance in Stanford, so we're hoping for a huge crowd today, okay?  Mm-hmm.  And I'm sure Earl will check in when he gets there.  Yeah.  Also, Anthony, we've got to talk about Rudy firing his wife as the city's hostess. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, it's getting so ugly now.  Yeah, we'll get into that next.  Of course, Sharpton sent to jail.  That's a huge story today.  And something I want to get into.  You hear about this cabbie that returned that stupid violin or whatever it was?  Yeah, cello.  The cello from the 17th century or something like that.  Yeah, 75 stuff about it.  And he feels like he deserves more money for returning it?  Yeah.  For being a good Samaritan?  Yeah, they cut him a check and it wasn't enough.  It wasn't?  Yeah, the balls would say it wasn't enough. 
[00:17:00]  Not enough.  That's some cabbies, man.  All right, we'll get into all that next.  212-757-1027.  Do you want a little dose of honesty?  You'll find it here on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  You're complete.  We'll see.  Disgusting, breezy.  1027-7027.  Anthony, from the fine folks that brought us Pinnacle Horned Goat Weed, they got a product  for the ladies called Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  Monkeying Around.  Timmy from Survivor, huge fan of our radio show, she swears on this stuff. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, she's been using it lately and said, well, yeah, I'm liking it.  My God, imagine her on the Monkeying Around.  Yeah, the people at Pinnacle came up with Monkeying Around, and it's for the ladies.  That's cool.  So if the, you know, lady, maybe your sex drive has dropped off a little bit.  Maybe, you know, once a week you're having some of the sex, and then once you start doing  it, you're like, hey, this is pretty cool.  I kind of forgot what this was like.  But then another week or two weeks goes by and you're not having the sex, take some 
[00:18:00]  of this stuff.  It would be all sexed up.  Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  Fan the flames of passion naturally.  It's a potent blend of all natural exotic herbs.  It's got the legendary Monkey Taekwondo.  And, of course, it's from the Fujian province in China.  So, for great romance and sex, remember the three T's, pleasure, passion, and Pinnacle.  Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  Get it at GNC and other fine health food stores.  Or you can call them up at 1-800-899-5365.  1-800-899-5323. 
[00:18:30]  Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  When it's time to get funky, you reach for the monkey.  Catch the best.  Devotee and Anthony.  Saturday, Saturday, 11 to 3.  on 1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  Lincoln Park.  Crawling.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-3-7.  Anthony, you got some facts? 
[00:19:00]  Some facts.  Well, we were talking about the Sox and the Yankee game.  What's the score now?  Yankee still leading 2-1 in the eighth.  Yeah, and now we brought up the point that it was pretty funny.  Hitler was only 29 years old last time the Sox won.  And won the series, obviously.  And a couple other facts brought up by West Coast Ableist in the San Francisco.  So, syndication on the ground.  Last time the Red Sox won the World Series, women not allowed to vote in the U.S.  There were no child labor laws. 
[00:19:30]  And the last time the Sox won the World Series, the Soviet Union had yet to exist.  So, a whole communist empire has come and gone.  Someone else wrote that Art Carney was one years old.  Art Carney from the Honeymooners?  Yeah, one year old.  And, of course, we were battling wars with biplanes.  With biplanes, right.  All right.  We'll take more facts. 
[00:20:00]  What else was going on?  Let's see.  The last time the Red Sox won the World Series, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the year at 82 points.  Up nearly 10% for the year.  82.  82.  Hill.  Nice.  All right.  Let's move on.  Yeah, we got the ridiculous cab driver story.  Yeah, what do you think of this cabbie that expects money for being a good Samaritan? 
[00:20:30]  What's the deal?  This cello was worth how much, Anthony?  $4 million?  They say $4 million.  It comes from the 17th century.  The Stradivarius.  There's been people that don't know anything about them.  A 1673 Stradivarius.  Yeah.  In this guy's cab on May 14th.  This Lynn Harrell guy, the cellist?  How the hell do you leave that in a cab?  How do you do that?  You're a cello player.  And you leave your cello? 
[00:21:00]  You know?  That's ridiculous.  Your $4 million cello.  You would think it would be, you know, handcuffed to your wrist at all times or so.  $4 million.  So this guy, he cuts the cabbie a check for $75.  Now, that's kind of a dick move.  Kind of chinchy.  But, you know, kind of chinchy.  But there's the brakes.  That is the brakes.  Because, you know, if the cabbie felt like it, he could have tried to sell it or do whatever the hell he wanted.  But he wanted to be a good Samaritan.  And I hope he just did it to be a good Samaritan.  Where is a cabbie? 
[00:21:30]  Would you even know what to do with a 1673 Stradivarius cello?  Would you even know how to sell it?  No.  You think this guy, I know what to do.  I sell firewood.  Firewood.  He doesn't know what to do with it.  But simply what I'm saying is if you're going to be a good Samaritan, you shouldn't expect something in return.  If you get something, bonus.  Thank you.  Thanks for the effort.  Thanks for, you know, helping me out.  So this guy, this guy got a $75 check or $75 and then turned around and then dissed and complained to the media that it wasn't enough. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, he turned around.  It wasn't enough for him being a good Samaritan.  The whole mentality.  Not enough.  Not enough.  So now the cellist, he, you know, he bid and he said, okay.  And he gave him $1,000 instead of the $75.  Right.  Gives him a grand.  That should be happy.  Now Ben completely disagrees.  I just, I come, I was brought up, if you're going to be a good Samaritan, you're a good Samaritan. 
[00:22:30]  If you get someone in return, great.  Take your chances.  But you shouldn't expect something for a return in someone's property.  Right.  Nothing to do with a good Samaritan.  Do you, if you've ever lost something in a cab, the chances of getting it back are slim to none, no matter what it is.  So if you get it back, the cellist, you know, the cellist, he's just a cheap app.  You could have a little, you know, you could have gone a little more cash than you.  $40 million or whatever it's called. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  The cellist?  $4 million.  $40,000 sitting around to get a cab driver.  That's what the cabbie wants now.  He wants 10%.  That's now.  This cheap bastard didn't, you know, give him 75 bucks.  I mean, you get your stuff back.  You never get stuff back.  Granted, the guy was very stingy.  The cabbie came up with something called a finder's fee, which should be 1% on the cello's estimated worth.  This is all for being a good Samaritan.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  And he wants, it's the brakes that the guy's a cheap app and he only wanted to give you 75 bucks.  You shouldn't expect anything for returning someone's property.  Oh, because I revert to the Brady Bunch episode.  The boys in a vacant lot found a wallet, right, with a lot of money in it.  And they wanted to keep it.  But, of course, they had a talk with their father.  And their father said, no, take an ad out in the paper, which they did.  But they still wanted to keep the money.  Someone came forward and they realized then it was somebody's life savings, an old man's life savings. 
[00:24:00]  So the man offered the boys a $50 reward, I believe.  And the boys were going to take it.  And then the father said, no, I think that's too much.  Then he offered $20, still too much.  Finally, they agreed on a $10 reward to split three ways.  You know, $3.33 each for the boys.  Now, this cab should take a lesson from the Brady kids.  Oh, my God.  It's not about how much you're getting.  It's about doing the right thing.  And if my dad was Mike Brady, I'd be a druggy. 
[00:24:30]  I'm not strung out from all his life lessons.  I used to watch that episode and get all pissed off.  God damn, this father sucks.  You know, first of all, just making him turn the money in.  And then the guy offers you a nice chunk of change as a reward and he says it's too much.  The guy's life savings, though, faggot.  Jim, what's up?  The guy looks so faggot.  Jim.  Yo.  What's going on?  Man, if anyone should learn something about being a good servant, it's just show us.  I mean, okay, the guy doesn't have $4 million. 
[00:25:00]  That's not the way that stuff works.  Like, classical musicians don't make that much money.  But still, like, he's not returning the guy's denim jacket for crying out loud.  It's Chuck Radio.  I'm going to switch over to some Dennis Leary for you and try to correct this static problem.  Keep it tuned here.  Thanks.  It's Chuck Radio.  Message me, Chuck1938 on A.W.  Messenger and let me know if this static problem has at least gotten better.  Or drop me an e-mail, ChuckRadio at Yahoo.com. 
[00:25:30]  Hello, Sleepy Beach Bomb.  How are you doing?  Back to ONA, guys.  Thanks.  Who cares?  We're going all the way this year.  This is the camera.  There's one.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't get to 20 yesterday.  Liz, what's going on?  Hey, Liz.  Hello?  Hi, Liz.  What's up?  Hi, how are you?  All right.  I just wanted to tell you that cab drivers, first of all, they suck.  And they have to return any property.  They're supposed to bring it to a precinct in the city.  Yeah.  And every borough has a precinct where it's mandated that they bring it. 
[00:26:00]  It's not like he was walking down the street and found it.  That's right.  And if you lose something in a cab and you don't know the cab number, then it's considered  law.  So if you get the cab number, that guy would have been charged with a crime.  So it's part of their job to return all this.  They're mandated.  So they have to.  He didn't do the guy a favor.  He has to take his property and go to whatever precinct he's designated for his borough.  Right.  And he must bring it to that precinct and report it to his garage that he brought it  there.  All right.  Well, thank you for that, Liz. 
[00:26:30]  And cab drivers suck.  All right.  Why?  Why the hatred for the cabbies?  Hello?  Liz?  Okay.  You know what everyone should lose in a cab?  A bar of soap.  Maybe they'll find that.  This is funny.  Chris.  You can't return it.  Chris.  Hey.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Yeah.  It's also illegal to not jaywalk.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  But anyway, the last time the Fox won the World Series, the cello was worth a thousand 
[00:27:00]  bucks.  Hey, see you guys later, man.  I'm out.  All right, Chris.  Good job.  Oh, Ben wants to do a little public service.  No, you can tell the folks instead of writing down.  I told you the other day how I have a friend that's a dentist and told me always to wear  my seatbelt in the cab because at least twice a month, boom, teeth get knocked out.  So you always wear your seatbelt in the cab.  On the air.  Everyone I know has been in an accident in the cab.  Really?  All right.  I always think they're kind of just impervious. 
[00:27:30]  It's kind of like that.  What's the Seinfeld bit about the cab?  The Seinfeld bit, yeah.  He's talking about how you get nervous in a car driving fast with your friends or something.  You'll even say, hey, what are you driving like a nut?  But the second you get in a cab and you're in the backseat and you're looking through that  glass, it's like you're in a movie.  It's like you're watching a movie.  The guy's driving through traffic up on the sidewalk.  You're just like, oh, there's a nice move.  Yeah.  I like that.  Nice, nice.  He can drive fast and jamming on the brakes, beefing, cutting in and out of traffic.  And you're just in the back like, it's okay because it's a cab. 
[00:28:00]  For some reason.  If your buddy was driving like that, you'd be, hey, you're going to kill him.  By the way, Ben, the last time the Red Sox won the World Series, they didn't have  cabs.  They had horses pulling cabs.  Last time the Sox won the World Series, the United States, 48.  That one will leave a bruise.  Wow.  That puts it in perspective, huh?  Yeah.  I mean, there was no radio. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, they had some kind of radio.  Not this kind of radio.  No, nothing.  Yeah, Scotso.  Scotso, an intern.  That was not that bad.  Virgin.  To all the ships at sea.  All right.  Where's that WOW sticker stuff again?  You should get a lot of people out there.  It's our first time in Stanford, Connecticut. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  I was going to be up there handing out the WOW stickers at Sippersteins, Stanford, Connecticut.  The address is 955 East Main Street in Stanford.  He'll be there hopefully by 430.  Roll it.  When did he leave, though?  Don't bet on it.  Who knows?  Ah.  Earl, give us a call and tell us where you are on the highway.  All I hope is that he didn't take the Port Jefferson Ferry.  What?  That's way out of the way.  Why would he take the ferry?  It was Earl. 
[00:29:30]  That would be hysterical if he drove all the way out on Long Island.  Which would probably be an hour and a half drive just to get to the ferry.  Then you've got to take the ferry.  Hopefully it's traffic.  Yeah.  I was avoiding the traffic.  Ugh.  Earl, give us a call.  I'll bite.  What's the word on the street?  A lot of words on the street right now.  What's the word on the street?  John from the NYPD.  What's up?  Hey, I'm on my way right now to the traffic court to fight a cabin for you guys. 
[00:30:00]  So I'm going to win this one for you.  What happened?  I don't know.  He was just driving like an a-hole and he kind of pissed me off.  So he got a ticket.  And he's fighting it?  He's fighting it.  You guys look like it.  You guys really look like you enjoy pulling over the cabs.  I hate cabbies.  I absolutely hate them.  And they think they're our buddies.  Because I always see the cops on the side of the road. 
[00:30:30]  That's right.  Pull it over.  Pull it over down the right.  What did I do?  Cabbies are a particular pleasure.  This one, I just happened to say that we have it out for him.  Yeah.  And I actually gave him a break, but he's getting one tonight.  And I'm going to win it for you guys.  All right, John.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  NYPD checking in.  What are my bullhorns?  What happened to your bullhorns?  I don't know.  Earl.  Yo.  Where are you, bro?  We're on I-95.  Well, that's a pretty big road, Earl. 
[00:31:00]  What part of I-95?  North.  North on 95?  Okay, good.  All right.  So that goes from Florida to Maine.  All right, Earl.  I'll bite.  It seems like you're in a bad mood today.  What's wrong?  I don't know.  I'm just sick and tired.  That's all.  Why are you sick?  I got a head cold.  Head cold? 
[00:31:30]  This guy's old, man.  Earl.  Earl.  Yeah.  A lot of people are looking forward to seeing you when you arrive at Sipperstein in Stanford.  I'm looking forward to going to Sipperstein.  Are you up for it?  I'm up for it.  I'm a gamer.  How many stickers did you bring?  A couple hundred?  We got them by the box load here.  Oh, good, good, good.  We got them by the box load.  Earl, what exit are you near?  We're right up, what is it, Jerome Avenue?  I can't see the sign of the truck. 
[00:32:00]  Exit 2A.  You can't see it, but it's a ramp that comes off the highway.  That's right, buddy.  That's right, buddy.  You don't.  We are crawling.  We are literally crawling.  You're supposed to be there in a half hour.  Hold on.  There's a guy that's four cars behind you.  Tom.  Yeah.  What's up?  I'm four cars behind Earl.  He's about your own Avenue.  Tell them 95 and the cross Bronx are a little bit different.  I said 95.  I never said the cross Bronx.  You're on the cross Bronx.  You're on the cross Bronx.  You're on the cross Bronx.  Earl, he's saying you're on the cross Bronx. 
[00:32:30]  You know what I mean?  I apologize.  You don't know the difference between the cross Bronx and 995?  You're not driving.  Oh, I am not driving.  We're here in the stickers, Tom.  Hey, thanks, guys.  You guys are great, man.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  It's funny.  I said I was on 95, not the cross Bronx.  You're on the cross Bronx.  Oh.  Oh.  Earl, what's your ETA?  ETA, approximately 45 minutes. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, right.  What?  All right, Earl.  Sorry, I'm losing my voice.  I'm not really talking.  I'm sorry.  What do you mean?  I'm losing your voice.  What happened?  I'm losing my voice.  Earl, what's wrong?  I'm sorry.  Are you bummed you didn't make the cut?  Oh, no.  What are you talking about?  You know, the cut.  You had to decide who's safe and who goes.  Are you kind of bummed you didn't make it? 
[00:33:30]  I have no idea.  Poor bastard, man.  All right, Earl.  It sounds like your voice is fine, Earl.  You're drinking some tea and a little lemon, a little honey?  Afternoon, I'm having a nice cold season.  For the head cold?  That'll hook you up.  Yeah, just a little cheap.  That's all.  All right.  We'll be there for you.  We'll be at Zipperstein, 965 East Main Street.  We'll be there well, thank you. 
[00:34:00]  All right, Earl.  Thank you, Earl.  Thank you, guys.  Well, thank you.  A little brand new.  A little brand new.  Look at that right there.  About some bourbon.  Take care of that head cold.  Head cold?  Got a cold?  Yes, I have a cold.  Excuse me.  Head cold?  You got some Dayquil, Earl?  No, I do not.  A little brand new.  Get him some brand new.  I don't want to see that son of a bitch again. 
[00:34:30]  You want someone to bring a shot of brand new to Zipperstein for you?  No, thank you.  What do you need, Earl?  You say it.  Someone will bring it to Zipperstein.  A gun.  Ah, a little brand new will help you out, Earl, okay?  Okay.  That's what they gave, remember Paulie in The Godfather?  Remember that?  We had the sniffles after Don Corleone got whacked.  Earl?  Yes.  Do you remember that movie? 
[00:35:00]  Yes, I do.  What happened to Paulie?  Paulie got whacked.  If I'm not mistaken.  I don't know.  James Conn sounded a little concerned.  Well, you got a call?  Get him some brand new.  And he walked out the door.  I want that son of a bitch.  Earl?  All right, Earl.  Here you go.  Give us a call when you get close to Zipperstein.  You're close there now?  How far have you traveled during this phone call, Earl?  Guys, I think we're just going to have to deal with the static for today  because it's not getting much better. 
[00:35:30]  Stanford's pretty far up there.  Yes, it is.  That's like you're going near the WWF headquarters, I believe.  Yeah, we're not too far from it.  We're literally doors down.  Earl, you tool.  There's an accident in the left lane at Castle Hill,  and the Yankee game just let out.  You'll be in that traffic for 45 minutes before you even reach 95.  Tell that loser who ever sent an email that don't play with himself.  Oh, wow, Earl.  Wow, he's sick.  Earl, you all right, Earl? 
[00:36:00]  Rambunctious.  Earl?  I'm fine.  Earl, I'll bite.  What's the word on the street?  Earl?  If it wasn't so damn funny, I'd get mad.  What's the word, Earl?  Is he staying or going?  I don't know.  I wouldn't blame you if you left.  All right.  Why?  I wouldn't blame you if you left. 
[00:36:30]  What do you mean?  I thought we were talking about something else.  Are you trying to...  Well, he asked me if you were staying or if you were going.  I said I wouldn't blame you if you left.  Earl, are you lashing out on management?  Well, yeah.  Wow.  Is this true, Earl?  Are you going to the River Rave with us this weekend?  Yes, I am.  Are you staying with Opie?  No.  I don't know.  I might probably grab a room.  Get a hotel somewhere.  Yeah? 
[00:37:00]  You've got to register with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts when you enter.  Because you're a black guy.  They really don't...  They like making sure they keep track of all the black people in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Oh, yeah.  Kind of like...  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah.  It's a movie patrol.  They have...  It's called the Underground Railroad.  So it takes you right into Boston.  And then you can get back out.  All right, Earl.  But I could plan on going, guys. 
[00:37:30]  Okay.  Well, get the zipper seams.  All your fans are waiting for you up there, all right?  All right.  We look forward to your next phone call.  Yes.  Great anticipation.  All right?  Yes, sir.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Earl's speeding down 95.  He's on the Underground Railroad?  I thought he was on 95.  Yeah, do you guys want to make a bet on the time he gets there?  Want to bet on what time he calls from... 
[00:38:00]  Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip, sip, sip.  All right.  It is now 3.57.  Let's round it off.  4 o'clock.  I say 4.40.  5 o'clock.  I'm going with 5 o'clock.  I'm going with 5.02.  I just knocked you out of the game.  No, no.  Ben?  The timer all gets to Sipper State.  He's not driving, which is good.  6.30.  6.30. 
[00:38:30]  Is that today?  6.30.  That's funny.  I might have to go with that bet.  But the good news is we have a van driver now.  Earl just kind of goes along, right?  No, we don't.  Lisa is driving the van.  What?  Yeah.  Lisa can't write copy, Lisa?  Right.  They hired a new van driver, but he couldn't make it.  Why?  All right.  So Lisa's driving the van?  Yeah.  She can't even see over the steering wheel. 
[00:39:00]  Which way are we going, Earl?  Earl, you've got to navigate.  I don't know where I'm going.  Why, damn it.  And don't call me a twat.  Earl.  What a mess.  What's up, sir?  He just screamed, tell Ben he's driving to the next sticker stop.  He quit again. 
[00:39:30]  He quit again.  He quit again.  Earl, we quit the sticker stop every time he does one.  Tell Ben he's doing the next one.  Ben can't do that.  He's too busy with our show.  Isn't that hysterical?  He quits every time.  And it's not a joke.  Like, he's really pissed and wants to quit.  And then he'll call back and go, no, I'm fine.  No, it was just, guys, I'm sorry.  It was my head cold.  I wasn't thinking straight.  I'm fine.  I took some day quill, and I'm a little foggy. 
[00:40:00]  I think what's even funnier, that we have friend Drescher driving the hell band.  Is there any way you can get us around this traffic?  Earl, I can't drive in this traffic.  How am I supposed to get to the sticker stop?  Earl, you're going to navigate.  And tell the guys they haven't mentioned stacker two in the last 15 minutes. 
[00:40:30]  You know what?  I'm getting phone calls from the client.  You know what they should do?  I got a great idea.  If you're listening, Lisa, stick your head out the window and start talking.  They'll think an English ambulance is driving by, and the cars will clear up.  Right?  That'd work.  Carl, this is very important.  The client wants a sale on time. 
[00:41:00]  Holy Christ.  I think he's saying 645.  Rick says 520.  Ben says Earl will arrive at 630.  I have faith that he'll be there at 502.  I'm sunk with 5 o'clock.  Yeah, I just knocked you out of the game.  Get Steve C. answer.  I'm sure that'll win.  Mr. Rigging Contest.  Jesus. 
[00:41:30]  Don't call him a rigger.  It's a rig American.  Eric, what's going on?  No, O&A.  Yeah.  I live about 10 minutes from the GWB.  It's like an hour and 45 minutes from here.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks, Eric.  Steve, what's your guess?  545.  545.  All right.  What?  Oh, did I?  Okay, fine.  Change your thing.  Hey, Eric.  Let's get some away here. 
[00:42:00]  We have so many prizes to get.  Where is Supersteam?  We've got to be there.  Oh.  I'm driving.  You'll navigate.  Human car alarm. 
[00:42:30]  Uh, Joe, what's going on?  Get me another phone book to sit on.  I need, like, the Bronx phone book and the Queen's phone book to see over the dashboard.  Yeah, it looks like an Ewok is driving.  All you see is hair.  I need blocks on the pedal. 
[00:43:00]  I'll get some blocks and duct tape them to the pedals and get me some phone books.  I can't see the emergency brake pedals in my way.  What are we doing?  A couple pairs of these?  Whatever.  Yeah, we'll do four pairs.  This is a really cool prize.  Yeah.  We've got four pairs of tickets to see The Hoos.  John Entwistle at the legendary Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey, on Wednesday, May 30th.

This is Carlos Mencia, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony  talking some s*** about every motherf***er you can. 
[00:44:00]  We're going to do some n***a jokes, some spit jokes, some kink jokes, some fad jokes,  and if you're a midget, we're going to talk about your ass, too.  Oh, Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  We had to go to the mattresses earlier this week, and we brought the gang down to Paisano.

We've got to bring those guys in, Adam and Greg.  Holy heck.  Very, very talented.  These two guys put, I guess, a poster together. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, it's caricatures.  Very accurate.  A bunch of people that are involved with this show.  Either guests or shenanigan makers.  And it's unbelievable.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, we're trying to get a picture of this and put it up on the website.  You guys got to see this.  If you're a faithful listener of the show, holy ass.  They have 41 caricatures, Anthony. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  And it's all the characters stuffed into our studio.  And it's everyone you know and love from the radio show.  We've got to get this up on the website, which won't even do it justice.  I mean, there's pictures of, first of all, there's, of course, us sitting there.  And look at Norton is reading Big Butt Magazine.  Greasy meat flaps galore. 
[00:46:30]  Dice is holding some Bosco and a big jar of you bet.  You bet.  Bosco or you bet.  You bet a vodka.  You bet.  Bottles of Sam Adams all over the studio.  A Jägermeister spilling on the console.  And there's Adam Ferrara with a big plate of spaghetti and an Olive Garden shirt on it.  Here's your family, Anthony.  Your family.  Hospitaliano, pal.  Sure.  They have Rick with the digital camera taking pictures of the two girls that are on the stained lesbian couch. 
[00:47:00]  You guys even have the stains on the couch accurately.  What about you?  I just noticed Uncle Junior with the half shirt that says Diva on it.  The pink Diva shirt.  The belly shirt.  You've got old Dirty represented.  He's stealing a computer.  And this is all done very well.  I mean, the artwork is fantastic.  Thank you, fellas.  It's been a pleasure.  Brewer smoking a joint with Stinky right next to him with his arm around him. 
[00:47:30]  Stinky's holding the whiffle ball back from the whiffle ball back challenge.  And there are flies flying around him.  And you even know what his favorite shirt is.  The Knicks shirt.  The Knicks shirt.  You've got to be wearing the Knicks shirt.  That's scary.  And then you've got Jay Moore in the back of the studio coming out of the Jay Moore suite.  Yes.  Which is like X-rated.  You've got signs going on in the background.  Unbelievable.  You've got Ronald Reagan calling from another studio in the background.  Psycho Mark trying to get into the studio.  That was the greatest.  The Ronald Reagan bit.  Yeah.  Psycho Mark trying to get into the studio. 
[00:48:00]  You've got Ben with his cell phone trying to make some drunken phone calls.  What about Silker Patty?  I've got to hear the impression.  I love it.  Oh, I see you put me in there, too.  I'm in a towel, Opie.  And I'm holding a picture of Baby Opie.  Yeah.  She's got a towel on.  And you even got her teeth perfectly represented.  99% gum.  1% tooth.  Check it out.  She signed all copies.  Oh, she signed it.  Yeah, she did. 
[00:48:30]  Wow.  Imagine having this and getting everyone to sign it.  Then you've got Brian Regan with a festival, Anthony.  Oh, that's a festival and a half.  You've got Brian Regan with a box of donuts.  A box of donuts.  There's the broken gumball machine that the limo Anthony gave you that you smashed.  It's on the floor.  Right next to the waste paper basket full of XFL game day tape.  Very funny, man.  You've got Jackie the Knife Girl with her arm around O.J. Simpson.

[00:50:00]  There's so much detail.  Otto and George, I think we mentioned.  We should get this mass produced and, you know, get the flange into it.  I'm sure they'd love it.  Yeah, the listener's got to have this.  Without a doubt.  It's a must-have for every good listener.  The two hot chicks you got on the lesbian couch?  Yeah.  I'm looking.  Do you just draw, like, the hottest nude chick?  Yeah.  This guy.  Like, I can imagine.  You probably could draw the hottest naked chick.  Look at that.  I got in trouble in first grade for drawing a naked Dolly Parton. 
[00:50:30]  I got it taken away from me, from my teacher.  I've always been doing spank material.  I touched my face.  No one's going to have to do it.  We've got to come up with a girl that would never, ever take her clothes off  and have you draw her naked.  It'll be painstakingly realistic.  I guarantee it.  Whatever you need, fellas.  Wow.  Donna Hanover?  You got it.  You got it.  With Vince Neil over it.  Vince Neil.  Donna Hanover.  We're doing the Motley Crue Challenge.  Oh, my God.  It's really unbelievable. 
[00:51:00]  It's a joy.  It is amazing.  May I say happy birthday to my little brother today?  No problem.  I'm not plugging anything.  No problem.  You guys are the best.  That's why I invested so much time in this.  With my little brother, Eric.  He's nine today.  Happy birthday, brother.  Bring him in.  God, God, God.  The boy keeps out with boy.  The boy keeps out with boy.  The boy keeps out with boy.  A lot of symbolism in it, too.  Like, Psycho Mark is pounding on the glass, trying to get onto the show.  Like, there's subtle symbolism. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, and there's Ben there with his little, uh...  Cell phone.  Ben with his cell phone.  He's in my watch.  I know.  I...  I...  It's scary, because you...  I'm in my watch.  You have Ben's favorite shirt on in this.  How did you get...  How did you get the subtleties?  Like, where did you go to know about the watch and the glasses and, you know...  Well, Foundry Music helped a lot.  I pieced together a lot of stuff before I even started drawing.  I drew it on a Macintosh G4 733 with a tablet.  Macs are great, man.  I just transferred to a Mac.  Great computer.  Mac, great for art. 
[00:52:00]  Great for art, exactly.  Anything like recording or graphics, you can't beat the Mac.  Any multimedia stuff, Mac is really good.  You walk into a CompUSA and look for games, though?  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  You got it.  Show him.  All you got is a home Yahtzee from Mac.  But as far as the details, and then Greg here, a great friend of mine, not an artist, but  an avid listener, longer than I've been a listener.  That's great.  He gave me a lot of input as far as what to put there, like a...  Gumball.  Let's say the gumball machine.  Yeah.  You know, that Anthony... 
[00:52:30]  The broken gumball machine.  The broken one.  You know, smash the bits.  Yeah.  I mean, look.  Hope you want to get out of that.  The Sam Adams.  This is so...  This is...  Can I just say that?  The Sam Adams.  This is so surreal for me.  Why?  To be sitting there drawing every night.  Tell people what you see.  Look at that.  I'm seeing what I drew.  It's ridiculous.  Sam Adams.  I'm enjoying a tasty Sam Adams.  I'm enjoying a delicious...  Just in case you thought we lied with those libraries.  Rick is on the left of them, and this is just like what I drew, and I'm flipping out.  We got to send one of these to Jim Cook.  I'm sure he'd be thrilled to see that...  I'm having a little impression, a little... 
[00:53:00]  It's like my great-grandfather used to say,  take your clothes off and don't tell your father.  Who are you doing?  All right.  We got a challenge for you.  We have a...  You don't have any of your art stuff with you, unfortunately.  Steve's got a great idea.  How long does it take it usually, like, to draw one person very accurately?  How long would it take?  This is a juggernaut of a piece.  This is something that I sat down with.  For heaven.  I'm going to go all out to you guys.  But, I mean, to draw a character, I mean, you can get that done within two hours, most 
[00:53:30]  likely.  So, if we come up with somebody...  A quick catch?  I mean, Anthony, this guy on the phone has it.  Listen, all right?  Steve, go.  Hey, Ant, how about the Full House twins?  The nude Olsen twins?  Yeah.  Wait, tell them, Greg, you got to tell them something.  What?  Guys, the twins were in this picture.  They were in the picture.  Their faces were in the picture.  Like, Adam started the picture with all faces, and they were in there, but, like, the capacity  of where they belonged was a little tough to figure out.  They didn't fit.  They were here. 
[00:54:00]  They were in the picture.  They were here.  They were in the picture.  Anthony, they were right next to you.  Nude under the console.  Nude Olsen twins on the lesbian couch.  You forgot.  You got it.  You got it.  I already have their faces done.  Forget it.  Forget it.  Tomorrow, email.  That's not a problem.  Can we take the picture yet?  Are we going to give it to Steve or something?  We're going to put this drawing on foundrymusic.com.  He's got the movie poster for The Soul of Nigger Charlie.  Wow.  I mean, what the hell?  And it is the poster. 
[00:54:30]  I actually found the poster online.  I would have put the Crunch Free Zone poster up there, too, but I couldn't make out what  the word Crunch Free Zone is.  Because you went on this all just from pictures that you saw of the studio.  From a whole montage.  That is great, man.  I mean, it's like a crime scene investigation putting all the stuff together from Foundry Music.  Wow.  Yeah.  But, yeah, I appreciate it, guys.  It makes it all worth it to come here and meet you guys.  Well, the phones are going nuts.  People want this.  I'm telling you, this is unbelievable.  We're going to put it up on a website and then check it out.  They got the key down at the bottom, too, where you have the silhouette of everybody numbered. 
[00:55:00]  Right.  And then all the numbers corresponding to the names of the people, just in case you're not familiar.  But, I mean, you could just look at it.  It's not like one of those where you go, who's that, who's that?  You look.  You know who everyone is.  The Caddyshack poster, beautiful.  Yeah.  The Caddyshack poster, all over the place.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, guys, if you need anything, any idea comes to your head, any crazy scheme,  any ethereal concept of it, I'll draw it.  I'll make it hard copy.  I'll email it right to you.  Anything you need.  The baby Opie's picture.  It's dead on, dude. 
[00:55:30]  It's dead on.  With Patty holding it.  Patty's holding the picture of baby Opie.  And she's in a towel.  Yeah, she's in a towel waiting for her whipped cream bikini.  Of course.  Oh, man.  Limited time only.  You guys, let me tell you something.  You guys, you nailed it.  And I know if we put this up on WNW.com, a bunch of people would want to buy this.  Hold on QTV.  What is it, QVC or whatever?  QVC dialing.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  But where the hell am I in this?  There's got to be a Dan West. 
[00:56:00]  It's not worth anything without a Dan West.  You're in your rookie car.  The kings of radio, bar none.  No question.  This poster, let me tell you, it's going to be worth $10,000.  Damn, man, man.  I'm in condition.  It's Jim Mint 10, God damn it.  Go after yourself today.  Jim Mint 10.  What the hell?  You can start your own poster store, God damn it. 
[00:56:30]  They nailed Stinky's wacky smile.  Stinky's smiling.  That was very scary to imitate Stinky's smile, just to look at it for so long.  There's a joint.  There's Rick, like you said, you know.  Everyone is dead on.  Dead on.  Dead on.  Right down to Norton's psychotic look on his face.  Eyebride.  And notice how many hands are holding the magazine.  Check it out.  Where's his other hand, Anthony?  Only one.  It's the subtlety. 
[00:57:00]  You're a genius.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, he's going to town.  All right.  Let's check on those.  So, Rick, are we going to get this on the website?  I am.  I'm so excited.  I want people to check this out for themselves.  It's amazing.  Black girl's got the Jap riding Yankee cap on, too.  Right.  Jap riding.  That can't be PC at all.  Is it?  No.  No, no.  We like to call them nips.  Nips.  Exactly.  In the spirit of the movie Pearl Harbor.  Of course.  Yeah.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[00:57:30]  Hey.  I think the drawing could be compared to the cover of Sgt. Pepper's.  Very good.  Thank you very much.  I've drawn that once, actually.  It's got the same key to it where it's numbered and stuff.  Very good.  Is it already on the internet?  Are people already looking at this?  Is that what it is?  I don't know.  I don't know yet.  Not yet.  Okay.  I'm going to love it.  All right.  Later, guys.  Think he rules.  All right.  Steve, did you check out this poster yet?  Yeah.  Think he rules.  Hey, Rick, we're trying to get this on Foundry immediately.  Steve's just a little upset, I think, because what?  There is no Steve C.  Oh, I apologize, Steve. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, hold on.  Hey.  Yeah, hold on.  The Foundry Music logo is up there, and the Foundry Music website is over there.  Exactly.  So Steve is definitely representative.  He's representative.  Either this can get scanned, or if you guys can send me either a JPEG or a bitmap of that.  A bitmap of that.  There's something I can put up on there, just so it's a clear image and not a picture of  this.  Columbo doesn't have a scanner here?  Absolutely.  Columbo's not here.  Moretta has one.  Yeah.  You know.  Exhibit base. 
[00:58:30]  The shot glasses.  All right.  So later on, these guys will email something to you, and you'll put it up on there, and there'll  be a clear copy up on the site.  That's cool.  This is amazing.  I would love to be your mercenary for hire.  Whenever it comes to doing any stuff, I'm your man.  I'll hook you up.  You don't even have to convince us.  This is just amazing.  Terrific, guys.  Cool.  Well, it's Adam and Greg.  Where are you guys from?  The island.  Originally from Staten Island.  Now I'm out in Mutton Town.  Mutton Town.  Ah, Mutton Town.  Nice area.  There you go.  Look at you. 
[00:59:00]  How you doing?  I'm Sam Adams.  He's got some cash in his pocket of Mutton Town over there.  I used to do some jobs on the estates out there.  Very nice living out there.  Terrific.  Yeah, my parents as well.  Sam and Lorraine, thank you for birthing me.  There was one job I was doing in Mutton Town was for this son of a guy that owns a lot  of commercial property out on Long Island, and I go downstairs, and I'm smelling something.  It's like, what the hell is that?  You know?  He's got this big tarp up, and I'm seeing these friggin' lights behind him that look like 
[00:59:30]  Close Encounters before the kid opened the door, you know?  Like all kinds of stuff.  I spread it apart.  Pot.  The guy's growing so much pot in his basement, and the guy's father, a very wealthy commercial  building owner out on Long Island, and I'm just like, this son of a bitch is going to  get screwed growing pot.  He could buy all the pot he needs with his dad's money.  Buy a 20 bag for Pete's sake.  Yes, and it was stinky.  All right.  Thank you.  All right. 
[01:00:00]  We've got to take a break.  Cool, man.  Yeah.  Thank you guys for coming by.  Bravo.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Unbelievable.  Everybody check out soundjomusic.com.  Check this picture out, and feedback is great, you know.  Yeah.  Good email.  No, they're going to love it.  They're going to absolutely love it.  Terrific.  It won't be up there for probably tomorrow.  Okay.  Or later tonight.  Yeah, you're going to send it.  If you send it right to Steve.  All right.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  Cool.  212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.  O-R-N-Y.

Yeah, he's only 10 minutes late so far.  10 minutes late.  You've got a little crowler happening, so we're waiting for him.  It should be pretty interesting.  Maybe Earl should call and tell us exactly where he is so people don't keep wondering.  And Lisa, the sales girl, is driving.  Right.  Sometimes an Earl can't drive.  Yeah, we heard about this. 
[01:03:00]  We've been waiting three years for him to come up to the United States.  We've been waiting for a long time for you guys to get up here,  so it should be interesting.  All right, Chris.  All right, guys.  Let's be cool.  Let us know when he gets there.  My voice sounded the windshield for me.  Wow, everyone is calling from the sticker shop.  We'd appreciate a call from the wow van to see where you guys are.  Yeah, how about some help there, Earl?  Let us know where you are.  The fine folks of Sippersteen's wants to know when you're going to arrive in Stanford, Connecticut. 
[01:03:30]  Here it is now.  It'll be like, Earl, why didn't you call up when we were asking?  I wasn't listening to the radio.  Oh, great.  My head cold got in the way.  My head cold.  He's got a head cold.  Oh, this guy's next to Earl?  Right next to Earl.  Let's see.  Let's see what Joe has to say.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, Joe.  Yeah.  You're right next to Earl?  Yeah.  All right, where are you guys?  I'm right at exit 8.  I think he's supposed to get off right here.  He's like past the exit, I think. 
[01:04:00]  How am I getting off right now?  Come on.  I swear to God.  That's Earl.  He's still going straight.  I see him up ahead.  I'm getting off at exit 8 right here.  No way.  And he's still up ahead.  I can't believe it.  And I think he's like asleep.  I saw him back a little bit further.  He's like asleep.  He just looks that way.  Yeah, he has a head cold and he needs to rest.  He's definitely past the exit.  Very strenuous to hand out stickers all afternoon.  Right.  Thank you, Joe.  No problem.  Could we get a call from the Wow Van? 
[01:04:30]  It would be nice to kind of update us on when you're going to be there.  Since you're late already, it might be nice to know if it's 10 minutes, 15, a half hour, whatever.  You want to know the other great thing about Earl when he does these things?  He shuts off his cell phone.  So I'll call him and I'll get, oh, you've reached Earl.  Please leave a message.  He doesn't even leave his cell phone on.  So we can't call him.  Even his cell phone doesn't work is what you're trying to say.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:05:00]  Why won't they call us?  Does the radio work in the van?  It cuts in and out.  It'll cut in and out.  It'll just shut off for like five minutes and then it'll turn back on.  My girl.  If anyone sees the Wow Van, can tell them to give us a call.  Yeah, roll the window down.  Make the universal signal for make a phone call.  You know where you put your thumb up and your pinky out, Opie, and you put it to your head like a phone?  Do that to them. 
[01:05:30]  Maybe him and Lisa are getting busy.  Oh, yeah.  Let me go to Mike.  Mike, what's up?  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  What's up, man?  What's up?  These guys are like an exit and a half pass.  They're over in the fast lane.  They're hearing the radio.  They're looking around.  They're going, uh-oh, I'm goofed up.  No way.  Dude, we're like past exit nine already.  And they're kind of with you?  They're like two cars in front of me right now. 
[01:06:00]  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  You're right.  We would like a phone call from the Wow Van.  We can't get him on the line?  Of course.  His cell phone's up.  Hi, UB, Cheryl.  Please leave a message after the meeting.  He's too much.  He's too effing much.  Anthony got a great story out of Miami.  My Jimmy.  It starts off, maybe he needs a hundred years of solitude.  Havana-born Hermenegildo Rojas. 
[01:06:30]  Is that a name?  Well, years ago.  Hermen, H-E-R-M-E-N-E-G-I-L-D-O.  Rojas.  I think the G might be a G.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Havana-born Mr. Rojas.  How's that?  Mr. Rojas, who's a hundred years old, appeared before a Miami judge one day accused of dousing  his 38-year-old girlfriend with gasoline in a fit of jealous rage, Anthony.  He's got a chippy.  Yeah.  He was born in 1901.  How old was he when the Sox won the World Series, Ben? 
[01:07:00]  If he was born in 1901, what was he, 17?  Ben, when was the last time the Sox won the World Series?  We could work from there.  1918, right?  1918.  Yeah.  So this guy was 17 years old.  Yeah.  Lisa.  Lisa's checking in from the World Series.  Oh, oh, good.  And then we'll get back to that story.  We'll get back to the story.  Lisa.  Yeah.  We didn't pass the egg.  These people were like out of their minds. 
[01:07:30]  What?  How much longer before you get to sip, sip, sip, or steam?  Probably 10 minutes.  Oh, my God.  Probably.  I can win this bet.  Damn it.  Wait a minute.  What did I have?  You had like...  I had five on the nose.  I have five of two.  And just so you guys know, the radio cuts out of the van, so...  Yeah, it's your voice.  It interferes with the signal.  Oh, so you didn't hear Anthony imitating you, Lisa?  Oh, Anthony, I feel honored that you have now imitated me.  No problem.  It's an honor to do it. 
[01:08:00]  So, Lisa, you're driving?  I don't think you have it down yet.  Lisa, you're driving?  Yes.  Do you have the phone books on the seat and the blocks on the pedal?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Got it down.  We're at the exit.  All right.  Oh, come on.  You didn't want to hear it?  Come on.  What was that about?  Got to go.  We're by the exit.  By the exit.  My phone book's sliding.  My phone book's sliding off the seat.  I've got to fix it. 
[01:08:30]  The radio keeps cutting out.  It sounds like driving by.  Yeah.  Little cocked airplanes you used to fly.  Like, not even the remote control ones.  The ones with the strings and with the gas engines.  That would just go...  I'm almost there. 
[01:09:00]  Almost.  I'll call you when we get there.  I'll call you.  That's hot.  That's a sexy voice.  I'm boomy.  You don't want to hear that.  I'm sorry.  Nice enough gal.  But that voice...  F my A. 
[01:09:30]  F my A, T F me, and C in my face.  I got the sipper stees.  I curdled the paint with my voice.  It popped open some gloss white.  It looked like cream cheese. 
[01:10:00]  Sipper stees is hiring me to strip paint off the houses.  With my voice.  I just go...  And the paint flakes up and blows off like sandblast thing.  Uncle John.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I thought Lisa's voice sounded like...  Didn't you do voiceovers from Mars attacks with that...  That's it.  That's her.  Hey, guys.  Thanks, John. 
[01:10:30]  Vito, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Vito.  How are you guys doing?  We're having fun.  This is a great show, I tell you.  Why don't we try?  Having fun.  We're going to kick ass tonight at O'Donoghue's, right?  O'Donoghue's.  First Street in Hope working?  Oh, I think Rick's doing a bar night down there tonight, huh?  We're going to party tonight.  Cool.  Rick and his bar night, they're legendary.  Legendary, he says.  That's right.  Legendary.  Legendary.  Legendary.  It's like a manning on crack. 
[01:11:00]  That's a Lisa account, too, right?  These Thursday night bar nights.  Yes.  Bar night.  Rick, make sure you have W-A-W.  Stop the bar.  Stop the bar.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Holy mother of Christ.  I'm so surprised she hasn't called back to bitch you out.  Ah!  The phone won't accept my frequency of voice.  Ah!  I call her a twat once and she just loses her ass. 
[01:11:30]  Ah!  She's too much.  All right, back to our story.  Oh, yeah, what happened?  So we got this Cuban, 100 years old.  Uh, he was, uh, before Miami Judge Wednesday accused of dousing his 38-year-old girlfriend  with gasoline in a fit of jealous rage.  100?  And he's got a 38-year-old, uh, girlfriend?  He's got a 38-year-old chippin.  That's good for a chick to be a chippy of 38.  He was, um, 62 when she was born. 
[01:12:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Well, that's like something you were saying.  He could be, he could be like 60 years old and go,  Oh, my, uh, my chick isn't born yet.  Oh, yeah.  At 60.  At 60, yeah, at 60.  Uh, Mr. Rojas, born in 1901.  He was 17 years old when the Red Sox last won the World Series.  Told the court he thought Janet Ali had been flirting with other men.  Ah, of course she was.  Yeah, what if she was?  Your 100-year-old yam bag, century yam bag, old man fag. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, just like taffy on a hot summer day.  Kind of dripping down.  Melted a mozzarella.  Just like it's hanging.  You know when you take that hot slice of pizza out of the box and you know you shouldn't eat it because it's very hot and the cheese starts falling off of it?  Sure, sure.  It's got to be what 100-year-old sap looks like.  Oh, crap.  Spreads it aside and then you've got it.  She's got two bat wings.  Oh, bat wings with tumors.  That's what it looks like when you spread those out. 
[01:13:00]  Ah.  She was not injured in the incident, Anthony.  But Mr. Rojas had appear in court.  And they delayed charges, blah, blah, blah.  Wow.  They've been living together on and off for six years in a trailer just outside Miami.  Goddamn.  100 years old with a 38-year-old girlfriend.  She must have been some treat.  I wish they had pictures.  You've got to wonder what that looks like.  Oh, she's got to be just a mess. 
[01:13:30]  A mess.  In a trailer outside of Miami.  100-year-old yambag.  We saw what century sex looked like.  If a woman looks like that at 100, hell, the guy got to look like it at 100.  Ooh.  Can't get that old, Opie.  We can't.  We can't allow it.  We have our pack.  Yes, we do.  If we're walking around with the pants, if I may borrow Norton's line from yesterday.  If we're walking around with our pants pulled up like William Frawley around our nipples, 
[01:14:00]  with the big Terminator sunglasses, with the walker with the hand brakes on it.  I've got to interrupt you, Anthony, because Lisa wants to tell you to go F herself.  Is that her voice right now, or does this got her?  Lisa?  You know what?  Next time you want something from me, Ann, don't even ask.  Oh, come on, Lisa.  Okay?  I know I have a horrible voice.  You don't need to tell the whole F in Tri-State area.  I know I don't know.  You don't need a voice than it is.  I know I don't need to tell them.  Lisa?  Thank you very much, darling.  We're here.  There's a bunch of people in the parking lot. 
[01:14:30]  You know I love you, Lisa.  We have a big line, and Earl's teeing in the bathroom inside.  Did I win?  I have five o'clock.  I don't know what time you have.  I had five o'clock.  10 to 5 we got here.  Lisa, where is this supersteen?  On Main Street.  What's the address?  What's the address there?  They're all going, we're an answer to her.  What's the address?  What's the address?  9.55 Main Street.  9.55 Main Street.  9.55 Main Street.  Kiss my ass, Anthony.  Kiss my ass. 
[01:15:00]  Do you want all to call you later or not?  We want you to call.  Yeah, you do all the calling.  All right.  All the calling.  All right, boys.  All right.  Talk to you later.  Okay.  I'll pay the hand of the stickers, Bob.  Give it away stickers.  For some reason, my voice has rendered the stickers unable to stick.  I don't know what happened.  It changed the molecular composition of the globe.  Now it doesn't stick.  It repels. 
[01:15:30]  I've invented an anti-gravity device.  Put the stickers on your feet, you'll float, because my voice has changed.  It's like that scene out of Splash in the TV section of Blooming.  It's like that scene out of Dogma where God finally speaks.  Yeah.  Blows his head off.  I mean, just explodes when she talks.  It's amazing.  Alanis Morissette was good.  Hey, when is Louis Black coming in here?  Louis.  For a while.  Any minute.  Any minute? 
[01:16:00]  All right.  Yeah, we love Louis.  He's very funny on The Daily Show, especially lately.  He's been watching.  Very good.  You know who left The Daily Show last night?  It was his last show.  Ellen's brother there.  What's his name?  Yeah.  Advanced DeGeneres.  Yeah.  Yeah, I knew he was leaving.  I didn't know he was leaving.  That's kind of a bummer.  He was really good.  He was really good.  But then they get a new guy who's just like all the other guys.  I don't know what the deal is with that.  You've got to pick the mold.  Yeah.  The sarcastic kind of condescending reporter stereotype. 
[01:16:30]  What is Ellen DeGeneres' brother going to do without The Daily Show?  I don't know.  I was saying that last time.  A lot of people, where is he going?  A lot of these people that make it in Hollywood and entertainment in general, they just make these stupid moves.  I know.  I don't understand.  It's like this guy had a great gig there.  Look at Brian Unger.  Brian Unger was doing The Daily Show.  And it was the same gig.  He was really the only one they had.  It was before they really, before Jon Stewart took over.  And they had a bunch of reporters now.  And doing this kind of news show thing. 
[01:17:00]  Unger was hilarious.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  Brian Unger, very funny.  Yeah.  And he left.  And now where do you see him?  Nowhere.  That's right.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Happens all the time.  I was the chef, man.  Here's a name.  Here's a name for you.  Ha.  Sable.  From the WWF.  Oh, remember her?  She thought she was bigger than the WWF.  She leaves.  Speaking of a voice.  Oh.  This is for all the...  Wow, it's the same voice. 
[01:17:30]  Ha ha ha.  Are you ready for the grind?  For the grind.  Ha ha ha ha.  Hey, before we take a break.  For all the men that want to see me.  And all the women that want to be me.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Before we take a break, we've got to get an update on Stinky and his roommate.  A lot of people...  Oh, yeah.  Because we're trying to hook Stinky up with a new roommate.  Because the one he has now is a pedo.  He looks at pedophilia pages in the middle of the night.  He's 62, 63, whatever years old. 
[01:18:00]  And he cranks him out in the common kitchen of this small, dank, little apartment.  Thank you.  Where they share a bedroom.  Last we checked with you, you were setting traps for your pedophile roommate.  Yep.  And?  None of them were broken, at least.  That I can tell.  Oh.  He's very sneaky.  Look at that.  Very good.  Could you put a small piece of hair over your butt crack to see if it's moved in the morning?  Because that would be probably an area you really want to concentrate on, other than maybe 
[01:18:30]  the hamper or your valuables.  You've got to do the stamp trick.  What's that?  Stamp trick brushes.  Oh, some postage stamps, a big strip of them?  Right.  And give one butt cheek to butt cheek, and then if they're broken, it's all over to you.  No.  This guy is so sick, I think you've got to go right for the duct tape.  Duct tape.  Duct tape to close.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So has he found somebody?  Did you find a room again?  There's been a lot of people that call me and stuff, but, you know. 
[01:19:00]  Nothing panning out yet?  It's kind of hard.  You know something?  If you went to Manhattan to get an apartment for what you're spending there to live with  a Danish pedophile connoisseur, you might have some problems.  Yeah, I know.  I'm going to have to find a roommate that I want to live with.  Unlike, you should have used that criteria, picking the last one.  Right.  One that you want to room with.  Right.  I could use a Dutch pedophile connoisseur's old man. 
[01:19:30]  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  I'll tell you one thing.  I'll give you guys credit.  I mean, you've got a lot of people here, but you've picked the worst time to do it.  Why?  Traffic all over the place.  Cops not.  Because the cops wouldn't have more than happy about it either.  Why?  What happened?  No, it's just the street's cluttered.  Eh.  It's a big mess.  But I'll tell you what, you guys got big turnout.  Oh.  Big turnout here.  You guys told us to go to Stanford.  We go to Stanford.  There you have it.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  If you're getting a lot more people, hopefully the traffic will stop and get stickers. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, no, they'll be there for a while, so.  Yeah, if you want to tell anybody, it's right down the street from the WWF building.  You got it, Chris.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  Let's give more stuff away.  Yeah, what do we got?  And Louis Black in a few minutes here.  Goodies.  Kind of goodies.  Yes, thank you.  Did you meet your roommate before you decided to...  Yeah.  Oh, you did?  I had an interview with him or whatever.  Like you...  All right.  You saw the ad in the Village Voice, so you showed up to his place.  What was he wearing, though?  Was he in his underwear at that point?  No, he was completely blind and everything. 
[01:20:30]  Fine.  He seemed normal then.  So when did he feel comfortable enough to start walking around in his underwear?  Oh, the next day.  You know, he just said...  Hi!  He led you on.  This is your room.  You hear that, Anthony?  For the interview, he was fully dressed.  The next day, he decided, oh, I'm comfortable with my new roommate,  and I think I'm going to start walking around in my underwear.  You know old people.  They get set in their ways.  I do this every day.  Screw off.  He did tell me he was gay the first day, though. 
[01:21:00]  Wait, after you agreed?  No, before.  And paid before.  He said...  How did he put that in?  He was like...  He said...  Actually, he said, I'm bi.  He's like, I might have girls come by, but I might also have guys come by.  I'm bi.  I swing both ways.  Boys and men.  But he's never had anyone by.  He doesn't even have friends.  Oh, my God.  I like doing hernia exams on all potential tenants.  Pull down your pants and cough.  Oh, God.  How's that for a topper? 
[01:21:30]  Oh, ho, ho.  We got a match gig.  Oh, ho.  With Charles Nelson Riley on it, we got to get some sound clips from it.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, ho, stinky.  Come in, my new tenants.  Oh, ho, ho.  You don't mind if I crack one out in the kitchen, do you?  Oh, ho, ho.  How's that for a topper?  Oh, ho.  I told you he was bi during the interview?  That means gay.  Bi.  I mean, he's a place to live.  There's nothing I can do.  Oh, ho. 
[01:22:00]  The first old gay guy you move in with?  The only.  Time to pay the lunch, stinky.  Oh, ho.  I think you would have roomed with Jeffrey Dahmer if you had to change.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  You're a little more dangerous.  How do my balls walk?  Oh, ho, ho.  Are they hanging?  Oh, ho.  Oh, whoa.  Oh, ho, ho.  How's those for testing?  Oh, ho.  Some scene over there.  That will probably get you out of there. 
[01:22:30]  It doesn't sound very healthy.  It's not a healthy environment.  You can hold a black light up to your bed when you get home.  Yeah, you have to do that to make sure it's well.  Yeah, but I've been in my bed, too.  Oh, ho, ho.  Thanks for telling me.  Oh, ho.  Too much info.  I'm going to roll around in your sheets like a cat in catnip.  Oh, ho.  Oh, ho.  Oh, ho.  Oh, ho, ho, all naked.  Oh, ho, rolling around, my feet up in the air.  Oh, ho.  How's that for a topper? 
[01:23:00]  Meow.  Can you picture him?  Can you see a cat?  They roll around in the catnip.  Oh, ho, man ass.  Oh, ho.  It's like catnip.  Oh, ho.  All right.  So the traps haven't been broken.  There's your update on Stinky Inner's pedophile roommate.  A lot of people wondering.  We have a four-pack of killer tickets to WWF Smackdown, June 26th at Madison Square Garden.  Tickets available now for Ticketmaster, but we have a four-pack for the 10th caller. 
[01:23:30]  212-757-1027.  D-Dyling.  D-Dyling.  Louis Black next.  Believe it or not, you're listening to the number one afternoon drive show in the air, too.  O.P. and Anthony.  D-Dyling.  1027-WNAW.  D-Dyling.  D-Dyling.  D-Dyling.  D-Dyling.  Hey, Anthony.  Yes.  Uh, BMW Films.  B-M-W Films.  D-Dyling.  D-Dyling.  D-Dyling.  D-Dyling.  We've been checking out this website. 
[01:24:00]  This site is really, really cool.  Short films, like five minutes long, put out by BMW Films, and they're cool.  They're all action.  So you get car chases, gunfights.  It's, uh, it's, it's like watching the best part of a movie, of an action movie.  And they got a new one out there now, The Follow.  Seen this one yet?  It's pretty cool.  It's got Forrest Whitaker.  Remember him, The Crying Game, Good Morning Vietnam.  And, of course, they never credit him for being in Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  That's right.  He was a football player. 
[01:24:30]  Yo, you got my Earth, Wind, and Fire tickets?  You know, never that.  That's never the credit anymore since he became a big star.  And also Mickey Rourke.  Remember him from Nine and a Half Weeks and that other movie with that, uh, Lisa Bonet?  And what about Pope of Greenwich Village?  Pope of Greenwich Village.  Charlie.  Big stars.  They took my thumb, Charlie.  They took my thumb, Charlie.  So look into the mind of a hired gun.  Had to follow this beautiful mark.  And, uh, why he follows, uh, cool cars, lots of money, all leads to a surprising conclusion 
[01:25:00]  in bmwfilms.com, The Follow.  Check it out.  Go to bmwfilms.com right now.  They have a bunch of cool movies.  We, uh, also checked out The Chosen, um, put out by the, uh, same guy that directed Crouching  Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Yeah, the upcoming films include, uh, Star directed by, uh, Guy Ritchie, Anthony, and Powderkeg.  Excuse me.  Directed by some guy that I can't pronounce his name.  Alejandro Gonzalez-India.  Thank you.  After you watch the movie, sign the BMW Films guest book for extra info and goodies and 
[01:25:30]  the trailers to upcoming BMW Films.  Isn't that the 100-year-old guy we were just talking about in Cuba?  Alejandro Gonzalez-India.  Very close.  Similar names.  Check it out for yourself.  It's bmwfilms.com.  Catch the best of O.P. and Anthony, Saturdays, 11 to 3, 1027-WNEW.  It's the O&A Show. 
[01:26:00]  Look who stopped by for a little visit, Anthony.  Yeah.  Lewis Black.  Lewis.  From The Daily Show on Comedy Central.  A regular on the show, but he didn't make our poster.  No, he didn't make this poster.  Yeah, that's a shame, though.  I thought you would have made that, but...  No, Giuliani made it.  Yeah.  Giuliani made it.  Giuliani makes it.  Yeah, we're talking about this poster that these two guys made.  It's just amazing.  But it's a great poster.  It's a lot of the guys you know and love from this radio show all in one studio.  It's just... 
[01:26:30]  Gay is what it is.  Yeah.  Heavy gay.  What a show that would be, though, huh?  Oh, yeah, that's true.  We're going to have a picture of it on foundrymusic.com later today.  You see how he draws the girls, too?  Very nice, right?  And if you could draw women like that, I would just be drawing nude women all the time.  So we gave him a challenge.  He is drawing naked Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.  What could be better, Lewis?  Even better, he should draw them as 18-year-old girls. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Make them a little more...  Where's the fun in that?  See, you know, what they're going to turn out to be.  That guy's a different target practice.  Right.  You know?  Those two.  Now, Giuliani, obviously, in the picture, you see all the divorce laws he's having there, Lewis?  I'm loving this.  No, it's fair.  I'm loving watching this guy being tortured by his equally as sick bitch, Donahano.  This is great. 
[01:27:30]  You know, the master of decency.  Yeah.  Now, this is the guy who has gone around the city trying to clean it up for the better of everybody here  and pour his morality out, like with the Brooklyn Museum of Art.  Oh, my goodness.  There's now the Virgin Mary made out of elephant dung.  This is horrible.  You know, must be removed.  And it gets removed.  Oh, the porno in Times Square.  This is awful.  What it does is it takes our youth and totally distorts their brains, and it makes it a worse city to live in.  It makes it a city city. 
[01:28:00]  A city city.  That's a double city.  A city city.  A city city, sure.  Right.  New York City.  You know, they call it New York, New York.  So I'm saying city city.  Right.  New York City city.  And what it does, it's awful.  And then he turns around.  He's bringing his chick.  Look at this thing.  You're a married guy.  You're not getting along with the wife.  They haven't been getting along for a long time.  Now it's all coming out.  She hasn't spoken to the guy in years, is what they're saying.  Yeah.  And the idea of the two of them mating at all just gives you, makes the hair on the back of you next day enough. 
[01:28:30]  You're just thankful that their children are old enough so that you can say it happened a while ago.  Yeah.  You know.  Happened a long time ago.  I don't want to think of him doing anything now.  And from what we hear, he's not doing much of anything.  Justice.  Take away our TD bars.  Take away the strip clubs.  Take away your boner.  See?  No such thing here.  Karma.  See, and one of the few times it actually has had any effect that you could actually see it happen. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Because most of the time, good people die and schmucks live on.  Right.  Live on.  This was a great moment in time.  But, I mean, this guy, decency, it's like, I didn't move here for decency.  If I wanted decency, I got to Omaha.  Exactly.  When you moved here, this was just a despicable city, disgusting.  If you wanted to go to the bathroom, you could go to the bathroom.  Anywhere.  Nobody bothered you.  It wasn't like, oh, God, oh, look, there's an origins.  I can't be here. 
[01:29:30]  Too much light.  Yeah, you didn't, that's not what we bought into in New York.  No, 42nd Street was, when I moved in, 42nd Street, it was like, oh.  It was nice.  Now you hear the tourists go, oh, 42nd Street.  What more could you ask?  What a good afternoon that is, right?  And now we miss that.  Oh, man.  But it's just incredible.  And the other thing, that whole thing about the Catholic Church, look, you know, he's the  defender of the Catholic Church.  Catholics knock the Catholic Church. 
[01:30:00]  It's the Church.  It's there to be knocked.  Right.  Because why?  Because they get a big guy, you know, the Pope, and he wears a dress.  You call him the big guy?  I think he's the big guy.  I like it.  I get a big, I love Catholics, because basically the Jews created guilt and the Catholics codified  it.  And then the Protestants transformed it into tension.  So, you've got this guy, I mean, they scream, oh, boy, you can't yell about the church.  That's why, you don't yell about another Catholic.  That's what you don't do. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  But the church, hoo-ha.  And he said, well, when somebody yelled about Jews, but you're yelling about Jews.  We don't have some sort of a monolithic structure that's unbelievable.  You've got, I mean, how can you, how can you, how can you not, how can you not yell about  it?  It's fabulous.  Lewis, what, why did you kill our God, though?  Oh, well, why?  Because you said, we're going to leave now.  And we went, no.  Hello?  We want to stay in the playground.  That's why.  He said, come on, follow me.  We're getting out of here.  Uh-uh.  No. 
[01:31:00]  Really, it was the wrong time.  We just started organizing as a, as a being on the planet.  And what, now you're putting down rules and regulations?  We just got out of the goddamn cage.  Yeah, really.  I mean, like, wait a second, they wrote this book, the Old Testament, and you're actually  saying we have to live like that?  I don't think so.  Give us time to sin a little bit.  A couple of thousand years of fun.  Yeah.  Then come back a little wrath, and we're fine.  Well, come back now.  You know, now would be a great time.  But anyone that comes back and says they're Jesus, we've got to put them in Delphi.  We talked to the Son of God two weeks ago. 
[01:31:30]  Did you?  Right here on this show.  Yeah, he called up.  It was, he said he was Jesus.  He was in Bellevue.  Yeah.  He called for Bellevue.  And then you think, oh my God.  Well, it'd be tough for him to find TV time.  Yeah.  That would be the thing.  He wouldn't even give him a cable channel.  He enjoyed the show.  I think, I think it was better in the old days when if you knocked the Catholic Church,  they put you on a rack and disemboweled you.  Yeah.  Now, you know, you just get Giuliani yelling at you.  I mean, the biggest shock about that, that, that painting in Brooklyn was just that, 
[01:32:00]  who knew there was a museum there?  Yeah.  See, I think it was a plug for the museum.  I do too.  A museum in Brooklyn?  Yeah, really.  I lived there.  I didn't know.  There were no signs.  There were no signs.  I don't even know where it is.  It's out there somewhere.  The Brooklyn Museum.  So he's all up in arms about that.  But then meanwhile, now, he's got his chick, who has now been kicked out of the mansion.  Yeah.  He can't bring her in.  So now, you hear what the latest is?  Giuliani now trying to have Donaghan over removed as the official hostess at Gracie Mansion. 
[01:32:30]  Man.  I missed that one today.  Yeah.  It's just getting so ugly.  And I love looking in on it.  Well, nothing, nothing after spending time in the big house for that big concept of morality.  Makes me happy.  It is a lot of fun.  What does Lewis mean by that?  You know, the old voyeurbus.com.  There's naked women on a bus driving through a town in my city.  So let's go. 
[01:33:00]  Let's go and stop them.  And there's a Jew on the bus.  Let's torture him.  Yes, sir, because I heard him say some bad things about our reward.  Let's get here.  Seems like you're still holding a grudge, Lewis.  Oh, ha, ha, ha.  I will hold a grudge until...  It cost me money.  It cost me time.  I had to listen to Norton Weep.  It was only six months ago.  It was only six months ago.  He will never pass.  He will never pass.  He will always pay for that.  He doesn't even...  We can't even file a suit against him.  You know?  Yeah, he almost got TB.  Well, he may have TB. 
[01:33:30]  Isn't that from anal intercourse?  No, no, no.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  I thought it was VED.  No, no, no.  VED.  No, he's like...  VED.  He said, watch out for TB and hepatitis.  Oh, you know.  Carolyn, who knew he gelled?  Carolyn.  Hey.  Yes, hello?  Hey, let's go.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  I didn't want to interrupt.  First of all, I love Louis Black.  I think he's hysterical on your show, Daily Show.  Big props to Louis.  Thank you.  Also, I wanted to mention, this week's cover of the Weekly World News, I just saw the checkout 
[01:34:00]  counter at the grocery store, supposedly a picture of a dead Timothy McVie at the slab  at the morgue saying, the picture is the government doesn't want you to see, and it's sort of like  the ultimate Do We Defeat Truman headline that really is totally false.  Oh, did they put that out before the order came in to stop the execution?  It was a May 29th issue, but it's, you know, obviously they moved into the cover before  him.  It's so funny. 
[01:34:30]  It's like totally caught in a lie.  Does that mean Bat Boy might not be for real?  Well, I think it's true.  You know, the kid with the huge mouth and eyes and the pointed ears and the big fangs?  Bat Boy.  It's a hit musical.  I know that.  That's unbelievable.  That's funny, Carolyn.  Yeah, I think they need to have a shot, you know, like that one of Truman holding up  the headline.  They really need one of McVie holding up that picture.  Yeah, there you have it.  All right, thanks.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  What do you think of the Timothy McVie, man?  Well, you know, you've got a guy who wants to die, and we're not going to kill him.  That's the kind of country I love to live in. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, why not?  You know, it's the first time we've got somebody, and it's the first time everybody,  I think, agrees, except for about six people, that this is called out of control.  Okay, we can discuss all sorts of things about the death penalty, but anyone, you know,  with any kind of lick of common sense, basically, he's like, no, he wants to die, he did  this, we're not going to talk about it.  But then how does the FBI misplace 3,000, and now it's supposed to be more pay?  Yeah.  I'm just kidding.  Why don't you just give it to them?  You know why?  Why do you do that? 
[01:35:30]  You fessed up to it.  It's not like you're holding, uh-oh, look at this.  It's an FBI file on the tires he had on the car we busted him in.  This might set him free.  This might turn over his confession, and the evidence, and the fact that he, uh, he said  he did it, and did it.  Yeah.  But for some reason, they held it back, and now it's screwed the whole thing up.  It's completely screwed it up.  And it's basically, you know, it's really, you know, I mean, we have very little stake  in it, other than, you know, we kind of look at it, okay, but those poor bastards who  were involved, whose families were involved, it's like talking about torment. 
[01:36:00]  I mean, it's like, you know, you're kind of poking them with a stick in the eye.  I like the, um, the Iranian way they take care of their criminals.  I got it, man.  Well, they're a fun group.  A little.  I heard that this story was in the paper the other day.  There was a woman accused of, um, being in porno, sentenced to death.  Guess how they found this chick?  I never knew the law enforcement was so good over there in Iran.  They watched the movie.  Her electric meter was in the background.  They zoomed in on it, got the number off the meter, and busted her. 
[01:36:30]  And went into her house.  She was, uh, convicted of some wacky crimes against God kind of thing.  Uh, and they stoned her to death.  And get this, how they stone you to death over there.  They bury you up to your head if you're a man, up to your armpits if you're a woman,  and then proceed to throw huge rocks at your head.  And if you can crawl out of your, your hole that you're buried in and probably tamped down,  uh, then you're free because it was God's will to let you out. 
[01:37:00]  That's how it feels.  As you're getting boulders thrown at your head.  But I kind of like that.  Yeah.  Lewis, you like that, right?  Well, it's an interesting guy.  Your show would be off the air.  Yeah.  You would have, uh, basically there'd be no women coming out.  Well, I don't like the laws.  I just like the way they deal with it.  Like if you blow up a federal building, buried up to the neck,  because I doubt I would ever be buried up to my neck with rocks hurling towards me going,  how did this happen?  Well, yeah, but you know what?  That's all right.  The problem here, then, is since we're a democracy, then we'd have to discuss,  it would be a 72-year discussion of the size of the rock.  The Democrats think that the rock should be 6.6 inches. 
[01:37:30]  I don't like the idea of rocks of this size.  Here's my shivish.  Jason, what's going on?  Dude, I totally agree with Ruth Black, and I totally believe in, like,  the U.S., the United States is becoming feminine.  We're turning into a pussy.  No one stands up for anything anymore.  We take it in the ass every day by every freaking country.  We don't do anything anymore. 
[01:38:00]  Dude, a dude wants to die, try him.  Get rid of him.  Yeah, we try harder to keep them from dying, even when they want to.  Right.  He wants to die.  And it's not like, a lot of people that are against the death penalty,  they bring up things like, maybe it's not him.  Maybe if there's evidence.  Maybe this.  No, it's him.  This is who is responsible.  But the most ironic thing is, it's not a group of guys.  It's not a group of, like, 20 years ago, even, you'd have a group of people out,  you know, the ACLU or whatever,  who would be out front trying to stop this. 
[01:38:30]  It's kind of barbaric.  And now, it's the FBI!  It's the people who want him smoke!  Right.  You know?  I mean, what are they thinking?  And why?  And it's like, it should be just sort of a giant investigation that goes on.  Because those guys, or maybe they should be wearing dresses like J. Edgar Hoover.  That's my solution.  The Hummet Knight put on a dress.  I just think there's scandal in everything now,  because people, I think there always was.  I think people look really deep into things now when they make the news,  and you find the scandal that happens. 
[01:39:00]  But everything's a scandal now.  Yeah.  Everything is scandal.  Yeah.  And what about this guy, this senator from Vermont?  Oh, the turncoat.  The turncoat.  This is unbelievable.  That's the best.  This guy, how do you change your party in midstream,  totally smacking your constituency in the face?  Right.  He just doesn't want to be a Republican anymore.  It's not the constituency, because the constituency of Vermont pretty much,  it'll drift wherever they're going.  You know, we're not talking...  But if you sat there and voted Republican... 
[01:39:30]  Right.  And then all of a sudden, they have the majority.  But they're a state that basically is a heavy environmental state.  And you've got this idiot who comes into office,  and God love him, because for me, he wins.  I've never seen anything like him.  There we go.  He's the most...  He is one of the most...  It's unbelievable.  I watched his press conference.  It was clinically...  I can't watch it.  I literally have to start hurting myself.  I mean, I'm getting into cutting while he's on.  It's like butter.  I just take a chunk out, just to stop myself from the pain he's giving me. 
[01:40:00]  It's unbelievable.  That's what caused Jebber to leave.  I mean, it's like he's trying...  Well, what are we going to do about the oil?  What are we going to do about energy?  Oh, we're going to dig for more oil.  You know, we're going to come into your home and, you know,  and put a little something up your teaster and look there if we can.  He's pumping out of human beings, if he could, that idiot.  He's a stark-raving man.  Look, it's a really great energy proposal.  It was 1958.  If there was black and white TV and we didn't know squat.  You don't like the energy proposal? 
[01:40:30]  It's psychotic!  What's the matter with it?  Well, what's the matter with it?  It's got nothing to do...  We're in the 21st century.  I got a phone that's like three inches big.  This jackass is going to tell me you can't.  There's no alternatives to energy.  What?  Are you nuts?  How do people listen to him?  We're just going to do a little drilling in Alaska.  No big deal.  Great.  Nine months of oil.  That's all I'm just going to get.  Nine months.  Woo-hoo.  That's going to help.  Have you ever been to Alaska?  Yeah.  That's going to affect us.  We're not going to be there.  I'm not going to go there.  I've been there. 
[01:41:00]  You don't want to rile those people.  They'll come in.  Those are the people who will come in and do damage to us.  They don't care.  They're liquored up the entire year.  Them and the animals.  Leave them alone.  It's nine months of oil.  Okay?  It's not worth anything.  Nine months is not worth anything.  Tell me you've got up there and you're going to get 50 years of oil.  It's got to be more than nine months.  Nine months.  That's the deal.  What?  What?  Two dinosaurs died and got buried years ago?  I shouldn't read this crap in a day.  You think I get upset for no reason at all? 
[01:41:30]  So the proposal, the energy proposal, is too hard on the environment, is what you're saying?  No.  That's got nothing to do.  I don't care about the environment.  Not a tree hugger.  I'm looking where I live.  I like trees.  I like buildings.  I like buildings and people.  Right.  I like animals and trees.  I look at them for a second.  They're giving me a rash.  You know?  What's your problem with the proposal?  It's a stark-raving man.  You think so?  Well, look.  First off, we have to live to another energy crisis.  We had an energy crisis, didn't we?  And what was the idea?  Well, let's conserve.  Let's do this.  Let's do that. 
[01:42:00]  Why don't we do something to find out about solar energy?  Why don't we find out about things?  Why don't we use that 30-year period to actually make coal something that can be used?  Coal is still, according to everything I read, to say that there's a safe coal thing is like saying there's a safe cigarette.  Right.  It's madness.  And then I got chain.  And it goes with somebody else.  I got oil boy one and oil boy two.  I got the, he chains over there to get hummers in his little pad from people who gave him 250,000 bucks.  Most of them, a ton of them are oil guys. 
[01:42:30]  And they're saying, well, there's nothing that Bill Clinton didn't do.  Oh, no, no.  All right, look.  Let's not even go back.  I don't even want to talk about it.  I spent eight years bashing that pig.  Now I got a new pig.  Let's get off that pig.  We got a new pig to bash.  Dick Cheney was having a little party outside.  He put up a little tent.  He had people come in that supported the campaign.  And it's not like come in here and then kick the money in.  They kick the money in first.  So it's not, it's even better than what Clinton was. 
[01:43:00]  No, it is better.  It's a really good thing.  It's a really clean way to win a government.  And let's just keep doing it.  Hey, hey, Carl.  Let's put everybody in a toga, too, while we're at it.  And have big parties and drink until we vomit.  Carl says you're wrong, Lewis.  Carl.  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Carl?  Lewis, it's totally wrong.  No, I'm not.  I mean, I don't know what he's reading, but nine months of oil.  Nine months of oil.  Even the Democrats have said.  Nine months of oil.  It's a fact.  No way.  It's at least 30 years.  At least 30 years.  No, it's a few years. 
[01:43:30]  Nine months of oil.  The Jews can make it last for 30 years.  Look at what they did on Hanukkah.  Nine months of oil.  Nine months of oil.  That's what I got over at the Daily when they did their research.  It's nine months of oil.  And I'm going to stick with the Daily Show.  Daily Show research.  That's what we do.  We got it.  They're insane.  We got it.  You lose your credibility.  I sat there.  I said it can't be nine months of oil, and they said it was nine months of oil.  So getting back to the Senate, what does the energy thing have to do with this?  Now, you don't like Bill Clinton.  You don't like Bush's energy proposal, and I can't see one. 
[01:44:00]  You can't see one.  I can't see.  I think it's a viable plan.  You know what I think, too?  While we're at it, let's sell more SUVs.  And you know what?  You know what?  Screw the SUVs.  Let's get monster trucks.  You know, because as long as we're going to do this, let's make it impossible to move on the streets.  Let's not worry about the wrong time around. 
[01:44:30]  I think we should.  I was walking over here trying to get a bus to come up the street.  And I'm sitting there going, this is psychotic.  It's reached epic.  In this city, you can't even get around.  So should we be like Ed Begley Jr. and run around on scooters?  No, that's not the alternative.  It's not Ed Begley Jr.  Where do you come up with this?  I see Ed Begley Jr. with his electric car.  Oh, yeah, that technology's great.  I just passed 30 electric gas stations on my way in.  Sorry.  No.  So that isn't even a concept.  And believe me, you want to go back to the day of the Pinto and the Yugo and the other O's that suck this car? 
[01:45:00]  I like my SUV.  I'm glad.  It sucks down the gas a little bit.  But then you can't.  But then it's smaller than a monster truck.  It is smaller than a monster truck.  But those are coming next.  Or possibly.  Lord, Derek, there's plenty of oil down there.  There's not plenty of oil.  And it's not a question.  I should keep pumping the oil.  That's fine by me.  But you know why?  When 30, you know, it's basically both sides.  And we can't even begin to discuss that it's not both sides that are involved in this huge problem.  We tried nuclear. 
[01:45:30]  Look what happens there.  One pops up and the whole population goes crazy.  You think you're going to be able to put a whole battery, a solar panel somewhere without people going,  It's too close to the schools.  It causes brain tumors.  Of course.  Yeah.  I mean, whatever we do is going to be wrong.  Right.  But it's wrong.  Right.  Let me say that.  You know, you've got to look at it.  It's just the fact that we did this 30 years ago.  Yeah.  And that nothing.  You remember the gas lines?  Right.  Yeah. 
[01:46:00]  And nothing changed.  They did nothing.  They sat on their asses.  They didn't come up with a Department of Energy that actually really does anything about this.  No.  Meanwhile, we've got cell phones.  Meanwhile, you know, you've got, like, they can come up with this technology to, like, shoot, like, missiles,  non-Egyptian missiles out of the air.  Oh, we're going to do it.  We're going to send things to the space.  We're going to play.  The Star Wars that was introduced by Ronald Reagan.  The president of all time, Ronald Reagan.  He's a genius, by the way.  Thank you, Louis.  I'm glad you agree. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, yeah.  There's a man who hated my motherland, Russia, okay?  Right.  And talk about stupid.  Oh, the Russians are going to get us.  My family came from Russia, okay?  They arrived here in 1906.  These hitties didn't know they were here until 1964.  We're not talking about a country filled with geniuses.  Oh, boy, they're going to come get us.  They're diabolical.  They barely had plumbing.  They don't even have shoes.  Oh, really?  That's because they spent a lot of money on bombs and missiles that could have done a great 
[01:47:00]  damage to this country, if not for the likes of Ronald Reagan, who outbid them in the Cold  War.  Made them fold their hand.  The cowboy president.  He certainly was.  Revered.  Yes.  We've got to let Lewis towel off.  I need a bear.  You need some espresso?  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down your underwear.  I remember that.  What's that goddamn stain on your head?  It's shaped like bonjour. 
[01:47:30]  Hello, Nancy.  Yes, sir?  Lewis.  Well, here's the thing.  Here's my problem.  You got Richard James giving $20 million.  We call him Dick.  Well, and there's a reason.  There's a reason you call him Dick.  Now, Richard Dick Cheney was given $20 million when he quit working for Big Oil.  That was his last job.  Big Oil.  Oil that's so big, it has no name.  It has no name.  We didn't even know what to do.  We didn't even know where to get their oil from.  And he gave him, when he went to work for Big Oil, he gave him $20 million, and he kept it. 
[01:48:00]  Okay?  And he said he'd have no trouble being objective about oil companies.  Well, you know what?  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  Oh, my God.  He pulled out the liar, liar, pants on fire.  You get 20 million bucks, okay, from an oil company.  I'll tell you this, and I think most people would agree.  There's no objective in the U.S.  You are in love with it.  Give him a 20 and say, hey, partner, thanks. 
[01:48:30]  Keep the change.  Well, you know something?  Beat the new boss, same as the old boss.  Bill Clinton, I'll bring him up again.  He got so much money from the goddamn Chinese, and in return, people were saying that the Chinese  weren't taking our military secrets, and that he wasn't selling it, and companies didn't  have free reign to give China our missile technology.  No, but the food in the restaurants.  Which I think is a lot more dangerous than a little oil deal going back and forth.  The food in the restaurants was better. 
[01:49:00]  That's true.  I'll agree with you there.  It's the same thing.  Nothing changes.  No, I know nothing changes, but you have to still scream about the fact that it's not  changing.  It's completely idiotic, and at some point, you've got to go, hey, the emperor has no  clothes.  Enough is enough.  You are killing us.  I'm living through the same river.  Wait, wait, wait, you can't say that.  I know I can't say that.  I love it.  I came up to that thing, and I'm like, what crap?  It doesn't matter.  The same river of ass that you're living through. 
[01:49:30]  Yes.  Yes.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Yeah.  Hose off.  I'm scared to ask him what he thinks about Reverend Alba.  We'll do that next.  I love the Reverend.

[01:51:00]  That's the ladies from the Colts.  They're going to be on tour with Monster Magnet this summer.  The O&A Show, Louis Flack in the studio from The Daily Show on Comedy Central.  We're exhausted just listening to Louis today.  Well, he's very passionate about his views. 
[01:51:30]  Louis, what makes you happy?  Well, what just makes you happy and makes you mellow out?  Uh, sex.  You know?  So you're never happy.  Oh, come on.  Well, you know, that works.  You've got the huge Republican apartment now.  This works.  Really good food works.  Really good food.  Really good.  Fishing.  Yeah.  Sushi, which we love.  Liquor at times will do it.  Like the Jaguar Meister?  You want a shot of Jaguar? 
[01:52:00]  We'll not do a shot of this.  This is, I was telling you during your break, is all the bar rags in America.  Sweets in one cup.  You've got to make believe that that's not a shot of Jaguar Meister in front of you.  Really?  Yeah, we just make believe on the radio.  Yeah, it's all fake.  It's all fake.  Well, I wouldn't touch it.  That's a great fake smell, too.  It is.  It's an unbelievable fake smell.  But you can look at something that color and you can smell it because I've done so much  of that garbage.  Yeah, I like paint.  It's worse than paint.  And paint calms me down, too. 
[01:52:30]  But I like paint and a little glue.  Right.  I find, you know, I don't really like to paint, but I like a big jar of it in front  of me.  And just to get a model played.  And that really always helps me calm down.  I like the spray paint in the bag.  I have a confession to make.  And it kind of calms me down, but in a perverted way.  And it's sick.  And I know it's sick.  And it's a confession.  And so I play golf.  Oh, you...  And that is sick.  You play golf?  Yes, I play golf.  That is probably... 
[01:53:00]  That's not smart.  No, it's not.  You know, imagine being in his foursome and you don't even know him.  You're just hooked up with Louis Black and his partner there?  I generally say...  Oh, God, I suck!  You know?  You just say that.  Well, golf, you've got to realize, if you think golf's a stupid game, first off, you're  right.  Okay?  It's a game played by idiots.  It's a game played by people who are afraid of using drugs.  They're scared of drugs.  You know, what about you doing these five hours?  You know, I'm not going to...  I can't do drugs.  Maybe I'll hit a ball around. 
[01:53:30]  Then, it's also for people...  It's people who don't hate themselves enough during your daily lives.  So, they pick a sport where they can continue to hate themselves.  And it's not even a sport.  To say that it's a sport.  You know, I drive around in a cart.  Why?  Because I don't want to walk.  Oh, you're seeing the nature.  No, you're not.  You're seeing just how crappy your shot is.  I'd like to get to my shot as quickly as possible and whack it again.  Try to fix it.  Yeah, and whack it again.  And that's the operative word.  Whacking it.  That's what you're doing on a golf course.  Yeah, I'm a hacker out there, too. 
[01:54:00]  But if I go to a course and I can't get a cart or something, I get pissed.  I don't want to walk.  No desire to walk.  The concept that you're out there to see nature is a lie.  No, but you walk to relax.  You just kind of take it in and think about your shot.  Then you're carrying your bag.  I don't want to carry my bag.  I don't need to carry the things that are hurting me on my back.  These clubs, they hate me.  You know, if I borrow other clubs, maybe I'll carry them.  My own clubs know me and they hate me.  That's how sticky it is.  Maybe we should take up, like, badminton or something.  Something a little less stressful. 
[01:54:30]  Where am I going to play that?  In my apartment?  Well, I heard it's big enough.  It is so huge.  It's massive.  That's all I need to do.  Oh, let's play some badminton.  And she hits the window and falls, you know, 16 stores.  I always look for the beer chick out on the golf course.  Yeah.  Comes by in the golf cart.  Little cart.  The beer.  That's like the first thing.  I'm on the first tee, and I'm looking with a beer chick.  And I just left the bar after having a few Bloody Marys.  As soon as you get behind, actually, a tree, when you're on the golf course, 
[01:55:00]  and it's kind of the nature goes out the window.  It could be a 500-year-old maple, and you'd say, you know, if I had a backhoe,  it would be gone.  It would be gone.  It wouldn't make sense.  Paulie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yeah, I think I know how to make Louis happy.  Yeah.  Louis, go to freaking Canada.  Canada?  All your socialist friends live up in Canada.  Oh, please.  You know, get a grip, okay?  It's called humor, putz.  Oh, yeah.  We're taking your news, hard news, from guys who go on location in front of a green screen  on the Daily Show.  That's hysterical.  I don't take it from them. 
[01:55:30]  You are taking it from them.  I don't.  Louis, you know I love you, man.  Well, thanks.  Let's do it, right?  Don't send me to Canada.  God, you know, and then, oh, God, can you imagine?  60 cents on the dollar?  Yeah, I know.  And just big, dopey-looking money.  Look at it, you know, I'm, like, sad now, because, you know, he just said,  oh, we're going to send you to Canada, you're a socialist.  I mean, he said, bark him like a dog.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, speaking of the Daily Show, what's up with Vance?  Way to go.  Vance was taken away.  Why? 
[01:56:00]  No, Vance left.  He's got a job producing.  He wasn't producing.  He's not going to be on camera?  No.  He's got a good job.  The goddamn guy was hysterical.  He was very funny, and he's, I mean, the odd thing is he's moving to L.A.  because he likes it, which is on strength, but his family is out there.  Yeah.  You know, Alan is out there and his mom, I guess, and the rest of his family,  and he just, and he wanted to, I think he said, too, to me that he wanted to get behind the camera.  He was, you know.  Yeah?  And it's too bad, because I thought he was very talented. 
[01:56:30]  He's very talented.  And who's the new guy?  I don't know who's here.  You don't even know?  I don't know.  I mean, I think they introduced the new guy the other day.  Oh, Lewis is snobbing the guy already.  No, no.  Oh, new guy.  I didn't even see him.  No?  Well, unless it's the guy from, I don't know who it is.  No, they don't.  The guy I asked to park my car.  Justin, what's going on?  I'm on the car.  Goddamn it.  Justin.  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  I heard Anthony talk about the scouting before.  I wanted to share a little story. 
[01:57:00]  I heard it from overseas in Saudi Arabia.  Yeah.  They had public executions there.  For Americans, they told you not to go out, like, on Wednesday afternoon.  They called it chop-chop square.  Chop-chop square?  Chop-chop square.  When you killed someone, they found you guilty in, like, a week.  No BS in the trial or anything.  They would take you out, tie you at the knees, the ankles, and tie your wrists together and  your elbows.  They made you crawl out on your knees.  Once you got to a certain point, you're actually crawling towards your execution.  Once you got to a certain point, there was a guy behind you in a brown robe. 
[01:57:30]  He set his teeth, and he hit you in the back with a stick.  Well, as soon as you fall forward, the first thing they think is, you stick your neck out.  As soon as you suck your neck out, they took your head off.  Oh.  That sounds really creative.  Oh, yeah.  And it was actually a public execution.  People would, like, crowd around and watch.  Oh, they don't have cable.  You lived in Saudi Arabia?  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, what were you doing there?  Yeah, what the hell were you doing there?  Oil?  I was a kid.  It was, like, 78, 79, and 80.  I was, like, five and six years old.  My father was an engineer who worked over there. 
[01:58:00]  Oil.  I'm sure.  Oil.  Oil.  The loot of all evil.  Yeah, I figured a little bit of a kick in the head.  All right, Justin.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care of your dad.  All right.  We went to, when I was really young, we went to this.  There is, you know, we went to Tunis, Tunisia.  Yeah.  And my friend's father was working over there.  Oil?  No, he was actually U.S. Agency for International Development, which has really got a bang-up job over there.  What a waste job that is.  Well, you know, you're over there, you know, kind of with 16 maids, you know. 
[01:58:30]  Okay, we're going to get this thing going at some point.  Get me a cocktail.  So, I arrived on the day after the Six-Day War.  The Israeli war.  I'm a Jew traveling toward this Tunis.  And as every Jew is leaving Tunis, it was absolutely one of the freakiest.  So, I arrive, and it's all the Jews are gone.  It's like I'm the only one left.  And it's just, it was insane.  And did you have this attitude that, well, I'm American, so it's different.  I have this attitude that is like, you know, I'm not Jewish. 
[01:59:00]  That was my attitude.  Is that what it was?  My attitude was, you know, I'm not really, nope, I don't know.  I think I'm Italian.  That amazes me that they're trying to rejuvenate the tourism, the Israeli tourism these days.  Because of all the stuff going on.  I mean, people don't want to go over there and visit anymore.  Who wants to go over there and visit?  Well, why would you?  How the hell could you?  The Jews are crazy, though.  They have this need like grunion.  They've got to go back. 
[01:59:30]  And right now, you've got to be off your rocker to want to go over there.  I've got a cure for the Midwest, and I don't know where that came from.  Somebody please help me.  The Midwest.  They've got to agamize me.  I tell you, that beautiful Midwest, which is, I think possibly the way to go is what they did in Vegas.  It's gambling.  It's gambling.  I think bring gambling into the Middle East.  You think that would help?  Well, it certainly helped Vegas.  There was nothing there, and now everybody's at peace and thinks you're going well.  It's a metropolis. 
[02:00:00]  It's driving.  Throw a few hookers in there.  You know what I mean?  Give them someone to hate.  Give them the house to hate.  Put them all in the room where they're all gambling on the same thing, and they can scream at the croupier.  They do seem to hate each other.  There's nothing over there but broken down ruins.  And they're fighting over them for thousands of years.  Yeah, nonstop.  You're absolutely right.  I think gambling would do it.  You're on to something.  Hello.  Hey, Rob.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Great show.  Thank you.  Little block's really killing today.  We love you.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you think Reverend Al's going to survive 90 days in the hall eating up butter eggs and bologna sandwiches or what? 
[02:00:30]  Reverend Al's in jail in Puerto Rico?  In Puerto Rico, right?  He got arrested, and again, he's a repeat offender.  So they threw him in jail for 90 days, three months, in jail in Puerto Rico.  And now he's crying that this isn't justice and he should be let out.  But, hey, hey, Al.  Who said don't do the crime if you can't do the time?  Where did I hear that? 
[02:01:00]  Was it on the beginning, Beretta?  I am innocent.  Please let me out.  Oh, my God.  I thought I was going to get a slap on the wrist.  Look at me.  I'm in chains in the paper.  You see me?  I am in chains.  And don't make jokes like somebody should be going, hey, 25, 25, do I hear 30, $30, $30, $35, $35.  O.J. is giving me advice, just like he is Robert Slate.  Don't take the loud detector test. 
[02:01:30]  Don't kiss your dead egg.  Yeah, Reverend Al seems to have gone a little too far.  Now, 90 days he's going to spend in a Puerto Rican prison, which I've got to tell you, that doesn't sound nice.  I'd rather be in Oz.  Where's Atabiki?  Well, you know, I mean, the thing is, is what was he thinking?  It's one thing to, you know, kind of be caught here, you know, standing in the street protesting something, you know.  Yeah, because we're America.  And you know something?  It's easy here.  And it's a city government thing, or it's, you know, you, you, you know, they want to use, you know, whether you like it or not, they're bombing the island, you idiot. 
[02:02:00]  You know, you can't, it's a federal rap, hello?  Right, now it's a federal rap.  Yeah.  It's not like, you know, it's all cute in the city here when they have a cause, and Reverend Al and some of the bleeding heart liberal celebrities go up and get arrested and processed.  And, you know, let out an hour later, I'm like, poor Louis, 28 hours later.  Yeah, but I'll tell you, thank God for him, because we were in his cell. 
[02:02:30]  They called it the Sharpton Suite.  Well, that's right, you told us that.  They called it the Sharpton Suite.  The Sharpton Suite.  I'm sure there's no Sharpton Suite down in San Francisco.  No, no, not down there.  No.  Not in the federal pen or wherever the hell he is.  But now he's bitching and saying, I should be let out.  Wait a minute, I made a mistake.  Oh, God, please.  Let me out of here.  They don't give me enough food.  Who's having anal with Reverend Al tonight?  Please send some lubricant.  I know I can't avoid it, but I can avoid the aches and pain. 
[02:03:00]  I don't know why they're picking this.  Why are they picking places?  That's the thing.  I was in Puerto Rico.  I can't figure out.  You look at the island.  I can't figure out where they're bombing.  You know, you reach this stuff.  You know what I mean?  There's 9,400 people who live there.  You're wondering what's going on.  You know, where do they bomb?  They're bombing to make the improvements.  You had to put in the Hilton.  Where are they bombing?  You would think they could pick a better place to bomb.  There's a ton of places that are just rocks and crap. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Why are they picking places for their people?  Unless you want to watch them run.  Hades.  You know, Tom Hades.  Oh, man.  How about Japan?  It worked one.  Oh, and there we go.  And there it goes.  The lights come up.  Brr, brr, brr.  Oh, no.  It was Pearl Harbor coming up.  Did you see that?  The reviews are just horrid.  They're saying it's this huge love story under the guise of being an action movie.  An hour and 40 minutes before one bomb drops.  An hour and 40 minutes of this schmaltzy love story. 
[02:04:00]  And then you get 40 minutes of Pearl Harbor after an hour and 40 minutes of this crap.  And then more crap after that.  Oh, man.  And the Disney politically correct version.  Yeah, of course.  It wasn't the Japanese or the Americans who were involved.  These were aliens.  Where now, I believe, they renamed the Enola Gay, the Enola Homosexual, because of a Disney  very gay-friendly.  So it's kind of like the Titanic.  That's what everyone's saying now.  With planes. 
[02:04:30]  This mushy thing.  And then you get 40 minutes of the bombing, which, you know, okay.  Then they're trying to protect the Japs and the Germans now.  And I say Japs as an homage to the movie.  Because that's what they were called.  Even Buzz Bunny called them Japs in the old wartime cartoons.  Well, the thing is, is that they had that party there.  Which they, Disney dropped $5 million.  And it could bring that aircraft carrier, apparently.  How much?  A million bucks.  That costs a million bucks.  I would say probably more than that.  An aircraft carrier.  Then you need the support group that it sails with.  They said it was like $5 million. 
[02:05:00]  Is that right?  $5 million.  $5 million.  Do you want to back up and talk to the correctional officer real fast?  Sure.  We're all over the place.  Tom.  Yeah.  You're a correctional officer?  Yes, sir, I am.  And you know about the Puerto Rican jail?  Well, put it this way.  I did three years working as a CO in Sing Sing.  And I've talked to inmates there.  And they say, I'll stay in Sing Sing the rest of my life.  She's going to send me back to Puerto Rico.  Oh, nice.  I'm someone's bitch.  I hate this being a bitch. 
[02:05:30]  Man.  Why I got to be a bitch?  Oh, man.  What do they say about the jails down there?  It's just all gangs.  It's all gangs.  There's no officers, no administration.  It's just a gang.  I'm going to get naked, get in the bag, rub myself in excrement, and put racial evidence  on myself like Tawana Broly.  Oh, man.  Yo, I'm a Latin king.  Don't hurt me.  Reverend Al, tossing some salad.  Yo, vato.  Tossing some salad. 
[02:06:00]  Tossing salad.  Mmm.  You want me to toss that?  I am feeling a little hungry.  Oh, man.  I'll take it.  What kind of dressing you got?  I like syrup.  I'll take a tall salad.  What?  Well, we should take another break.  All righty.  Hey, Ben, we got something to give away?  I'm trying to give out some of our stuff today.  A free dog head.  We have a dog head sent to us by one of our listeners.  If you're a dog head, it's a dog head off of a dog. 
[02:06:30]  We just happen to find it by the side of the street.  Sure.  It could be yours.  You can mount it on your wall.  That'd be nice.  You can just put it on the dash of your car, of your monster truck.  Don't hop on a Razor roller board scooter then, Louis.  I like the big SUV stuff.  I know.  In the winter, in the winter when it's snowing.  Oh, but people can't then yell about the cost, you know, that we're in an energy crisis. 
[02:07:00]  You know?  I learned from the other energy crisis.  What you've got to do is get an odd and even number license plate.  And you switch up on the odd even date.  I learned from these mistakes.  That's phenomenal.  I learned.  And there'll be people tomorrow doing that.  Yeah.  That's a great idea.  All right, we've got something for a winner and three friends.  You're going to be in a luxury suite for the WWF's King of the Ring.  That's very cool.  Louis loves WWF wrestling.  I lost a job recently.  I lost the World Wrestling Federation announcer. 
[02:07:30]  Beat me up for a gig in the movie Rollerball.  Really?  Yep.  Just another reason for me to love the WWF.  A remake of Rollerball?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah, exactly.  It's getting a, yeah.  Wow.  It's a much fun in the movie right now.  Yeah.  You're shooting a year.  So who got the gig?  One of the announcers.  I can't remember which one.  From the Taz?  No, what?  Jerry the King Lawler?  Taz, I'd be thrilled.  I think it's, no, which is Hammer?  Paul Hammer?  Paul Hammer.  Yeah, from ECW.  Paul Hamish. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, I know.  Paul Hamish.  Yeah, I gotcha.  You know.  All right.  So here we go.  We've got, all right, four passes to a luxury suite for the WWF's King of the Ring,  June 24th at the Continental Arena.  We'll give that to the 10th caller.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  I know I'm a loser.  And Anthony.  I can't get a city of my life to turn it on.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Isn't that radio stuff wacky?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  1-0-2-7. 
[02:08:30]  W-N-E-W.  Ah, Anthony, Sam Adams.  We love it.  I'll prove it to you right now.  Lewis, would you like a Sam Adams?  Oh, yeah.  I'd like a fake Sam Adams.  Lewis, can you tell?  There's only days left in our country.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Got shot to Jägermeister in here.  Sam Adams.  You need heroin?  We got some.  We got our dealer.  Yes.  They're not going to tell us no at this point.  We're going to do what you want.  Sam Adams. 
[02:09:00]  Memorial Day weekend.  This weekend.  The unofficial start to summer.  Get your summer off to a better start with a better beer.  Sam Adams.  My great-grandfather used to say,  don't tell Grandma when I touch you where your bathing suit covers.  Now I drink beer to forget about my sexual abuse past.  I'm kidding.  I don't know if Jim Cook has been abused as a child.  He acts like him.  Wow.  Wow. 
[02:09:30]  Actually, I lost oxygen on that.  Jim pays for these spots.  Jim loves it.  He knows we're kidding.  I love the guy.  It's like a comic.  I could just go, ah, then I love the guy.  And everything's fine.  Tell Lewis about the personal note Jim Cook wrote to us.  Yeah.  There's something going on where a beer company like Sam Adams would send out a little memo,  a little letter to us saying they're doing a little contest between the radio stations.  You do a read or you do a contest based on Sam Adams and the best one wins a prize. 
[02:10:00]  On the bottom of ours, the handwriting from Jim Cook, the head muckety-muck of Sam Adams,  that said, any promotion is not to involve anal sex.  And we're thinking, I wonder how many of those you had to write out.  How many of those?  Answer a D-1.  Do not involve anal sex in the competitions.  Right.  And you know why you wrote that?  Because once we did.  Did you?  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  That's for Sam with the people having sex all over the city.  And they got the two-point conversion for anal.  Right.  Yes.  Really.  Anal.  Reminds me of my great-grandfather.  Really.  This is the weekend.  This is the weekend you're fattening up, boy.  And this is Sam Adams, brewer, patriot, and kid-toucher.  I don't know history, Sam Adams.  I seem like a nice guy.  I'm kidding.  I love the guy. 
[02:11:00]  I love Sam Adams.  And I drink it.  I love it.  Trade up this summer.  Better food, better parties, better beer.  Look forward to a better summer with Sam Adams.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  You know, Ozzy hasn't called the show lately, Anthony.  I know.  Big fan of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:11:30]  Today we got Louis Black in the studio.  Opie, Lowry on the instant feedback is saying, how funny would it have been if Louis had gotten the announcer job in the new Rollerball movie.  And Jonathan E. of the Houston team is on stage because George W. Bush has no idea what to do about the energy crisis.  Nice.  Real fast, Anthony, those guys that made the poster of the cast of our radio show.  Yes. 
[02:12:00]  It's amazing.  It's right behind you.  It has almost everyone, I should say, because Louis Black is not represented on the poster.  You know, the socialists aren't represented in the Opie and Anthony society.  But it's amazing.  The artwork's amazing.  It's a great job.  Yeah.  And there's pictures of it now up on foundrymusic.com so everyone else can check it out.  Oh, it is.  Yes.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  They should put a link to them.  That's a digital picture. 
[02:12:30]  We're going to get something sent to Steve that, you know, it'll be much clearer.  At least you can get a peek.  I'm going to try to give foundry a little support here.  I'm not going to bash them.  I'm punching up the page right now.  I'm looking for it.  Okay.  Let's see.  All right.  Let's see.  All right.  I'm on the front page.  First shot of the cool poster.  Steve's already in most recent files.  Okay.  I'm in most recent files.  JPEG, hold on.  Steve is looking at you.  Here's a shot of the, just give me an idea of the poster. 
[02:13:00]  This is interesting, right?  Okay.  It's always interesting.  More interesting.  Only more interesting than the Internet is someone watching the Internet.  Very good.  Yeah, well, you know what it is?  We've had a problem in the past, and I have tried to log on to foundrymusic.com,  run by Steve, right behind you.  And I swear to God, as I was trying to look for a file of a nude woman,  I think I put a satellite out of orbit.  Inadvertently.  Because the site was a little complicated to navigate. 
[02:13:30]  Only slightly.  To navigate.  A little hard.  We've worked on the problems.  Yeah.  It's fine.  Magellan had an easier job of navigating than I do when I try to navigate the waters of  foundry music.  But I found that very quickly.  I'm glad.  And you can't really get a good idea, unfortunately, of this.  Check the one right below it.  There was a close-up shot that Rick took.  Obviously, it's not going to be as good as when the guy sent me the actual electronic  file, but it'll be right.  Yeah, tonight it's going to be really good. 
[02:14:00]  Because I can zoom in and out.  Okay.  Oh, that's much better.  All right.  It looks like this is in Chapel.  I can see it.  Doesn't it?  Mike.  Yeah.  We work at a movie theater, and Pearl Harbor's on four out of the ten screens.  That's right.  Netflix theater.  We work all weekend.  I'm counting on, like, millions of people, I think.  Everyone in the world wants a movie theater.  Did you hear they're changing the ending for the Japanese release?  They are, because they don't want to offend the Japanese, because there are certain lines  at the end of the movie that, and get this, some Japanese groups said this, might 
[02:14:30]  make the Japanese look like they were the bad guys.  Yeah.  Boy, that's a little odd.  They were the bad guys.  All right.  Unbelievable.  That's what they said.  Revisionist history.  It's great.  I love it.  Let me...  Go, go, go.  Boy, are you going to tell a story?  Yeah, I am.  I want to tell a post, because they switched their date on me, and I want people to know  I'm going to be at Governor's the 22nd, but at Levittown. 
[02:15:00]  Levittown.  But the Sunday, I'm going to be...  It was supposed to be Saturday at Medford, which will be the 23rd.  I'm going to be there the 24th, which is Sunday night.  Okay.  Sunday night, I do work as a priest on the island, and then in the afternoon, I have  brunch, and then on Sunday night, the 24th, I'll be at the Medford Governor's.  We call the Medford one the retarded governor.  Yes, exactly.  Yeah, Governor's on the Prairie, we call it.  That's great.  You take a covered wagon.  Little girls are running down hills and falling in flower fields.  And nobody knows where it is. 
[02:15:30]  It's Medford, and no one knows where it is.  Way out there.  I think I've got a man out there.  I want people to know I'll be out in Medford.  Hey, uh...  But I was going to tell you a story.  You want to hear the story?  Yeah, no.  Go ahead.  Tell the story.  Well, thank you.  Really?  Tell your goddamn story.  No, I'm not going to tell you.  Tell your elitist golf story.  No, I am not telling the story.  I go out, I work, I do a benefit for Children's Hospital.  Oh, it's a benefit.  Okay.  You weren't just out golfing with Kathy Lee.  Who can pay for this?  Who can pay for golf? 
[02:16:00]  I'm going to be $175.  Is somebody going to give me a Hummer?  It does cost a lot to golf.  I literally, when I call, and they say, oh, it'll be $180.  I go, is there lunch?  Yes, something.  Okay, or can I kill an animal?  You go to an amusement park where it costs millions to build these coasters and stuff.  It doesn't cost you as much as it does to walk around on a field where the only thing they have to do is put holes in the ground.  Holes in the ground.  That's it.  And mow the lawn.  Mow the lawn.  You know?  Watch out for things like, you know, chinch boats and whatnot.  I did this thing for, uh, is this part of the story? 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, this is part of the story.  Wow, I am not going to tell the story.  No, tell the story.  No, I've never come in to tell the story.  No, no.  You have an agenda.  No, I don't.  I hate to take you out of your hands.  No, no, no.  For Lewis to tell a story.  Anthony, we want in here, Lewis, a story.  No, you don't.  I was listening.  All you want to do is kind of come in here and post me.  Don't make me scream like a pig.  You told us the story during commercials.  It was very funny.  So what we'll do is we'll pretend that we haven't heard the story. 
[02:17:00]  That's all.  Oh, God.  That's not even worse.  So, Lewis, you were doing a benefit.  Oh, man.  Was golf involved?  Golf was involved.  Oh, okay.  But, no, the important thing was it was a benefit for a children's hospital in Durham, North Carolina.  And you go down and you do these things, and there's a bunch of really fine comics down there.  And then Saturday, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  You know, wow.  Yeah, wow. 
[02:17:30]  That's it.  Story's done.  What?  No, no, no.  I wanted to hear about what...  Story's done.  I am not going to fall into this.  What?  Story's done.  Oh, my dear.  No, no.  You know, no.  What?  You heard your headphones.  I didn't hear at home.  That was just an old joke for you.  No, that was not.  You were so full of it.  It is beyond belief.  You know, I'm not Gary Coleman.  I might be twitched like a Gary Coleman.  He's Louis Black.  Of course.  You're much taller than you are. 
[02:18:00]  Make this...  You know something?  I'm listening, and I wanted to know what happened, because he said Kathy Lee Gifford's there and comics.  And then that night, the comics did something, but now I don't know what it is.  No.  Kathy Lee Gifford performed.  Oh, she performed.  It's a big...  They did a big, big performance.  It's Kathy Lee Gifford.  They open up with a woman named Gracie.  Hello.  Hello.  Don't get me on.  No.  The story will not be told. 
[02:18:30]  No, what?  The story will not be told.  Oh, it?  Nope.  The story will not be told.  That's it.  I slipped.  No, you didn't.  I slipped.  You slipped with a sledgehammer.  You slipped.  Nope.  Look, you're upsetting Anthony.  No.  I can't.  Look, I don't care.  I'm not going to.  No, I'm not going to tell the story.  It has something to do with Kathy Lee Gifford.  Kathy Lee and who was the other one?  Nope.  He was about to know.  What was the name, though?  You don't even let me get to the...  I'm sitting here.  I'm paying attention.  No.  Yeah, this is like...  I feel like I'm in a bad...  I got to know. 
[02:19:00]  I am not going to be in a bad episode of the three students.  What was her name?  Oh, Gracie.  Gracie.  Who was Gracie?  Oh, Gracie was performing, Anthony.  I thought Kathy Lee was performing.  No, she was just kind of hanging.  Kathy Lee and Gracie.  Were they doing the duet?  It's like going to a bad college course.  Yeah, it is.  It's deconstructing my story.  I'm not even interested in my story.  All right.  No, you have not.  Yes, we have not.  No, you have not.  You've got...  You've got my...  An arsenal over there.  A missile.  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, yes, you have not.  You ruined it.  I am not.  I am not going to be...  Can you just tell me who Gracie is?  No, I'm not.  I got to know.  No, no, no, no.  No, you're going to kill us if you don't tell us.  No, I'm not going to kill you.  Look, all is fine.  Look, I'm starting to think it's now a character that Kathy Lee does.  No, no, you're not.  But think about it.  Make up your own story.  And let the destructo deal with you.  Was Gracie singing karaoke?  No, she wasn't.  What did Gracie do?  No, not Gracie.  Any kind of performance?  No, whatever you want. 
[02:20:00]  Whatever you want.  Let's go.  All way up.  No, whatever you guys out there think that Gracie did, she did.  I want you to close your eyes.  You are killing...  The left that you drive in...  The listeners will kill you, Lewis.  I will not go through this for their amusement.  All right.  I will not be through it.  All right.  When you see Lewis and the governors in Medford and Levittown, you're going to have to scream  during the whole show, who is Gracie and what did she do?  Is that how you want to play?  That's how we're going to play.  You know, you're going to send the army out to the point.  No.  Because I will listen. 
[02:20:30]  Because I will get to the point in the story.  Because they will allow me.  Yeah.  As opposed to YouTube, please.  I know.  Lewis, I didn't have my hands near the machine.  You are like...  Opie is now...  It's like I'm a big bass and you're really me in.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  You are so paranoid.  You know our show.  I want to hear it.  You know our show.  We had a little fun.  Now it's time to tell the story and we get the laugh.  It's time to club the baby seal.  No.  No.  Are you okay? 
[02:21:00]  Ziggy, don't you want to hear who Gracie is?  No.  No.  Who's Gracie?  Please.  Is it like a George Burns and Gracie type character?  Yes.  Why don't we all guess?  Come on.  Do we have the listeners guess?  I'm not going to do this.  You said it was a really good story.  No.  Because if I do this, then I lose either way.  I'm a jackass this way.  And then if I tell the story, I'm a jackass.  It's like I'm now a jackass in black and white.  But if I tell the story, I'll be a jackass.  Everyone on the phones want to know who Gracie is. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, because they're going to be holding signs up at your show now.  Okay, Gracie is.  Okay, here it goes.  Thank God.  Oh, man.  I'm doing nothing.  Are you doing it?  Yeah.  We've got an army out there.  No.  We've got laser technology.  Golfing, children's charity.  I've got a finger on the thing.  I can watch it happen in front of me.  All right.  That's the sad thing.  All right.  What do you need to happen?  I need all of you up in the room and I'll tell the story.  My hands are up.  Children's charity.  What's the charity?  All right.  She was in a car accident in 1983. 
[02:22:00]  She's had 61 operations.  She's an inspirational singer.  My hands are up.  Okay.  But what type of songs does an inspirational singer do?  I Believe I Can Fly.  You know that song?  I believe.  That was my, um.  I believe I can fly.  She comes out.  She's a paraplegic.  You know, she's got, she's lost both her legs.  She's, I don't know, stilt things or whatever those mechanical legs.  Be more funny.  Okay.  There we go.  There it is.  That's it.  Story's over.  You son of a bitch. 
[02:22:30]  No, story.  Story's over.  Opie.  Story's over.  Story's completely finished.  I will not, I will not do this.  I don't know what happens.  I don't believe you.  Nope.  She's singing inspirational song and Opie ruins it.  No, story's.  Yes, you do.  Yes, you do.  Be more funny.  He says to a comic, be more funny.  You know, I, that's it.  That is truly it.  You, you guys have exhausted me.  I don't even care about Gracie.  And I'm certainly not going to tell this story ever again to anyone. 
[02:23:00]  You leave me hanging now.  You can call me over the weekend.  Gracie.  Nope.  Uh, uh, uh.  Nope.  She's a paraplegic.  Nope.  She does inspirational songs.  So they wheel her out.  No, she had the, oh, she had the, uh, braces?  The little arm brace thing.  The arm brace thing.  Right.  Like Tiny Tim from, uh, whatever.  Are you guys talking to somebody?  She comes out.  Did you decide who was just left the building?  Who was just left the building?  Was, just please tell me this.  Was it an interaction between Kathy Lee and Gracie? 
[02:23:30]  Not in eight years.  Yeah.  Has someone yelled at me?  What?  No, that, in eight years.  And that sound in my head is coming me from the room.  That was.  And I think that was Homer Simpson.  That was Homer Simpson.  Yeah, it was so great.  He's a cartoon character.  Lewis.  You're getting mad at a recorded voice.  Yes.  I just have to know if she, if Kathy Lee came out and started doing her maudlin crap with  Gracie.  Oh, you could.  Imagine it.  Look in my lap.  Look in my lap. 
[02:24:00]  Because I don't hear you.  No, all it all.  Lewis, it could be yes or no answer.  Did then she have an interaction with Kathy Lee?  No.  Oh, okay.  No?  That's the whole thing, and that's what we do.  God damn it.  No, it's called shaping a story.  And we try.  All right.  Giving time and space.  I have a feeling she might have fell down.  No.  Did she fall down while she was singing?  No.  No, she didn't.  So she's singing inspirational songs on the stage.  Everyone that played golf.  He's gargling.  Oh, my God.  He's gargling.  He's having a good night.  He's lost his mind. 
[02:24:30]  You've driven me around the bed.  You have driven me around the bed.  I've got to know what happened to this chick.  Guy recently, though, had a five-inch fish that he caught, and he swallowed it and choked  it up.  You know that one?  There's the story.  There's the story.  Beginning, middle, and end.  Got it?  That happened.  That happened.  I got it.  No, this I can't tell you.  This is a secret story.  Upstate.  Okay, can you tell me if all the celebrities I've played were watching? 
[02:25:00]  I'm going to share it with people on a bus before you.  You too.  Come on.  She came out with a little arm braces.  You're walking with arm braces.  No.  Excuse me.  You're never going to get to the bottom.  No, you won't.  You won't.  Not now.  Not into this.  I was so psyched to hear that Opie wrecked it.  Yeah, right.  Opie wrecked it.  Did Gracie give you a Hummer?  Uh-uh.  No.  No?  No.  She's inspirational.  People don't think of that as inspiration.  All right.  So she takes the stage.  Where is it?  And she starts singing.  Are you talking to them? 
[02:25:30]  What is this?  A guest story?  It's not for...  We're not playing...  I've got to know.  Because I get all...  You don't understand.  I have like a pet peeve where a story starts.  I've got to hear it out.  You know how many people are going to be waking up in the middle of the night going,  What the...  What happened with Gracie?  Well, you know, write your own story.  Who was there as a comic that we can ask?  What we can do is get on the phone, have every person give us a word,  and then we'll make a story about Gracie.  What other comic was there that I can ask?  None that you know.  I am the only one.  God damn it.  I was the only one who was there. 
[02:26:00]  Who was the one?  Larry the Cable guy was here, but you don't know him.  No.  Can we come to an agreement here?  No.  There's no agreement.  I had my hands up.  Opie, hands up.  Hands up.  Hands up.  Louis, please.  Nope.  Please, if we put our hands up.  He's gargling.  Everyone's hands are up.  No.  No.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  She takes the stage.  No.  She's got the braces.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Kathy Lee.  No.  No.  Was she playing golf?  No.  Was she playing golf?  No.  No.  Did she play golf? 
[02:26:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Are you answering yes or no?  No.  No.  No.  It's really not fair.  It's fair to our listeners.  It's not fair to me.  Okay.  What if I promise that I'll let you finish the story?  All right.  Promise.  You know what?  Promise?  Just thinking about my story, I hate it now.  Okay?  But you know it.  You've lived with it a while.  No.  No.  I hate it now.  I hate it.  Yes.  I hate it.  I hate it.  I hate it.  And I hate me. 
[02:27:00]  And I hate Gracie.  And I always hated Kathy Lee Gifford.  But I hate her even more now.  Inspirational song.  No.  No.  You've got to finish this.  All right.  20.  20 inspirational songs.  She comes out.  She takes the stage.  She crutches out.  Yeah.  She comes out on the crutches.  No.  There are no crutches.  You knew that.  Let's go back.  You didn't hear the person.  You know.  What?  She's got her legs.  Those legs.  They make mechanical legs.  She's got fake legs?  Yeah.  Get the F out of here.  No.  Now, are they moving?  Does she have the crutches?  No.  She's moving out. 
[02:27:30]  How does she walk with fake legs?  Not only that, she also, they apparently rock climbs.  Did you have like a springboard thing?  I don't know how those things work.  You know, I have no idea.  It's Robo Gracie.  Yes, right.  Is she the stunt woman?  Nope.  She's an inspirational singer.  Okay.  And she comes out with a fake leg.  Yep.  And she sings.  And she does, you know, rock climbing and what else?  What's the other thing?  Skydiving.  How do you learn that?  That's stuff I wouldn't even do with real legs.  How do you learn that, though?  Did she come out and tell everybody that she skydives and rock climbs?  No.  Her husband does that while he's playing the piano while she's drinking water because the 
[02:28:00]  first song has kind of exhausted her, and so she's, you know, gulping a lot of water.  And then the thing that was funny about it, and it's not so funny now, is she then, you  know, it's like, you know, you're giving money to charity.  Right.  So they launch into this, you know, and I'm going to sing this song to the children, and  you know, and, you know, I'm going to give them some hope that I was given, and then  she launches into, you know, and then it was Jesus.  It was Jesus.  And, you know, Jesus did this, and Jesus did that. 
[02:28:30]  And, you know, I'm like, you know, and being Jewish, it's like, but stop, okay, I'll take  an inspirational song, but you don't tell me, oh, yeah, Jesus is coming into the hospital.  I thought I told you to shut up.  You did.  Yeah, but now you can kiss my ass, you other cartoon character.  I will not be whipped by God.  Excuse me, but I do believe that's just egg.  Man, that's it.  You guys are brutal with it.  You should bring me in as a whipping boy. 
[02:29:00]  For God's sake.  And you felt like sharing that story.  Oh, it'd be the worst, Lewis.  Feel free to throw the Jagermeister at him.  He's dumbfounded over there.  Oh, you know we love you.  Well, I know it was the setup for this.  It was good, but you got to be legitimate for him.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  So what happened?  Okay.  There was nothing going to happen.  She said, I have to go home now. 
[02:29:30]  And I went, okay.  There's Frank.  Wait, does this story go back to Kathie Lee Gifford, really?  At some point, which we won't know will be because of you.  You've destroyed it.  And destroyed possibly our friendship.  Oh, I know we're truly friends.  You're killing me.  Oh, God.  I need a lung scraper.  All right.  So Kathie Lee had nothing to do with the story.  No, no, no.  She just happened to be there.  Oh, maybe it wasn't Kathie Lee. 
[02:30:00]  Maybe I was hallucinating.  It was a good chick.  Hallucinated the whole weekend.  All right.  Cute little story.  It is.  Oh, yeah.  It was.  Well, the Jesus part was cute.  Yeah.  You know, he was on coffee cups.  All that stuff.  He was around everywhere.  He's the reason I had par on the 14th all.  But that's another story.  He walked with me down to the green.  He said, Lewis, I know you're a Jew, but you're going to make that part because I am Jesus.  And I was able to.  I was able to.  Well, you know, it's. 
[02:30:30]  No, we're listening now.  Well, good.  Good.  Listen to this.  That's the sound of the void.  That's what that is.  Nope.  That's the sound of the void.  You hear it.  I hear it all the time.  What's that sound?  It's nothing.  It's the sound of nothing.  It's the sound of the.  Literally, the unity is fucking itself in.  Turn it off.  Turn it off. 
[02:31:00]  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Is it this sound?  Is it Gracie Rosenberg?  Turn it off.  Is that who she is?  Gracie Rosenberg.  Gracie experienced the devastating car accidents.  Yeah.  Leading to 50 operations and the amputation of both legs.  Yeah. 
[02:31:30]  However, Gracie's faith in God, beginning as a six-year-old at the knee of Holocaust survivor,  oh, brother.  Yeah, okay.  What a story.  It is a long, long story that she really didn't want to be dragged through the first time or  the second time.  Oh, there she is.  Oh, there she is.  See, look at it.  And there she is.  Well, look at this.  She's got little pictures of her singing.  Yeah.  And there's her with Lewis.  Oh, no, no.  No, there were no pictures of us taken together.  Look, she's jet skiing. 
[02:32:00]  Yes, she is jet skiing.  She's rock climbing.  She's snowmobiling.  Mm-hmm.  That's her.  Wow.  You know, I mean, if somebody comes out on artificial legs like that and sings as well  as she does, you know, don't tell us the right.  They don't even know.  We read about it.  Right.  You know, that's enough.  Okay?  And then don't bring Christ into the equation.  It's a charity thing.  So then Kathie Lee now comes out.  I'm not going to tell you.  But I got to know how Kathie Lee fits in because she's all religious and high and mighty  and with God.  She said, I want to leave Frank.  I want to come to you, Lewis.  And she flew in. 
[02:32:30]  And they were like, I'm sorry to perform this weekend.  Well, I don't think this is the same story.  Well, it's a different story.  It's a story that happened while I was watching her perform.  That was the story I made up in my head just to get through the performance.  Okay.  God damn it.  Well, I hope you've ruined it.  Well, it's a horrible story now.  It's a story I don't even want to remember.  You know what?  I don't even want the memory.  I had the memory.  The memory has now been destroyed.  I've taken it and I basically, I wouldn't even tell the story to my friends. 
[02:33:00]  I'm exhausted.  I'm whipped.  I'm whipped.  You know?  Thanks, Toby.  I've come here for fun.  I've come here for, you know.  And look at what he did.  But yeah, why don't you just put me in.  But let's show the kids how to barbecue today.  We have this Jewish man.  We're going to shove this thing up his ass.  And we're going to turn him over.  We're going to bury him over the spoon.  Oh, very nice.  That is very nice.  That is very nice. 
[02:33:30]  What is that?  What is that?  Who recorded that where?  I couldn't tell you.  I think that was...  That is just wrong.  Yeah, that's wrong.  That is really wrong.  All right.  Okay.  Great.  I feel better.  I feel so much better about us.  I feel a hate for myself.  I haven't a long time.  I'll be appearing in Medford.  Yes.  On June 24th. 
[02:34:00]  The governor's there.  And June 22nd at Levittown.  Yes.  Governor's at Levittown.  Yep.  And I won't be telling you the story.  Why?  Because the story's not funny, ladies and gentlemen.  It was not funny at all.  As a matter of fact, I don't even think I went.  You weren't there at all.  I am erasing it.  The fakes are being erased as we speak.  Lewis, I love the story.  No.  No.  I enjoyed it.  No, you didn't.  I enjoyed the story.  You enjoyed playing with your little buttons.  Much of the way the Nazis enjoy torturing the Jews in the camps. 
[02:34:30]  Okay?  I understand.  And I get it.  I get it.  And it's fine.  It was fun.  I would have liked it a lot better if I knew what happened with Kathy Lee and how she was involved.  Yeah.  I told you what happened.  She entered my brain.  I don't think that happened.  And she sees me.  So we'll give you a few minutes to calm down and you can tell us about Kathy Lee.  No.  We won't be talking about that.  We'll be talking about how the big ships are in and we're glad to have the Navy in town.  Yes.  That's what we'll be talking about.  Or maybe Old Navy.  We can talk about that.  But we're not talking about Kathy Lee. 
[02:35:00]  That bitch.  I don't even want her name mentioned again.  Okay?  But I don't want to hear any more sounds when I'm speaking.  Okay?  Nothing's enough.  I am not going to play Gary Coleman today.  I've got a half an hour of this.  This is sufficient for any man to put up with.  We're listening and playing things at the same time.  Unbelievable.  Isn't that horrible?  Oh, man. 
[02:35:30]  Nice one, Opie.  Thank you.  Oh, well.  We'll play What Do We Learned Next.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony.  How are my little pigs today?  Do I have to drive the bus?  Can I ride on the bus?  Where's the bus?  The thing with the young girl is I think we're going to have to do it.  Well, I'll go to court with it.  She's not 18.  She's not 18.  It's a mockery.  The election isn't over and there's no team.  Do I have to drive the bus?  Can I ride on the bus?  Where's the bus? 
[02:36:00]  How are my little pigs today?  We use you for good radio.  We're not your friends.  Unbelievable.  Oh, my Lord.  Shoot me now.  The thing with the young girl is I think we're going to have to do it.  I'll go to court with it.  Do I have to drive the bus?  Can I ride on the bus?  Where's the bus?  I don't know which one's going to show me, Anthony.  I've got to go blood point in my ears.  How are my little pigs today? 
[02:36:30]  We use you for good radio.  We're not your friend.  Anthony.  Yes, Opec.  We just found out what happened with Kathy Lee Gifford.  Yeah.  Thank God he didn't tell that story on the air.  Yep.  No kidding, bro.  No kidding.  I'm very glad I didn't tell it.  How's the sex life, Lewis?  Doing all right?  I don't need that horny goat stuff.  No, no.  No, this is Ultimate V.  Just one of your thoughts.  There shouldn't be anything else for your sex life.  What is this? 
[02:37:00]  Well, listen up.  Ultimate V.  For the Ultimate O.  And you know what I mean by O.  Mm-hmm.  That means when you take your C and put it in the...  Mm-hmm.  Right.  The C.  Ultimate V.  Very different product.  Clinical findings.  Always that clinic.  Clinical findings.  Prove that a combination of herbs and Ultimate V equal the effects of the leading prescription  enhancement medication.  I think we know what that is.  Well, you'd have to be an idiot.  That's right.  Whether you want to increase your sex life or as an aid for some kind of sexual dysfunction.  Ultimate V.  Yeah.  Look at that V. 
[02:37:30]  Ask Giuliani.  He probably knows.  He could use the Ultimate V.  It's a serious product for people who are serious about sex.  Ultimate V is guaranteed.  It works.  And the packet fits right in your wallet or pocket.  It's so convenient, and the best part...  It's for both men and women.  Well, listen, you put that in your pocket, and that's...  You sit on it for a month before you get lucky.  You know, whenever you put that...  I'm going to put it on black again, and you might as well...  That's it.  It's like they can see it.  They have X-ray eyes.  It's kryptonite.  Yeah.  But not Ultimate V.  Nope.  Give it to her and yourself for the night of your life. 
[02:38:00]  Can you have it, too?  Oh, yeah.  It's for ladies, too.  Ultimate V for the Ultimate O.  You've got to get Ultimate V now.  Call them up.  1-888-808-8800.  1-888-808-8800.  You can check them out on the web, too.  Ultimate V.net.  That's Ultimate V.net.  He used to fantasize about sex like this.  Right, Lewis?  Yeah.  Not anymore.  Nope.  Now it can happen.  Right.  I'm with you 100%.  If there was ever a time to be ready for anything, it's summer.  Be prepared. 
[02:38:30]  1-888-808-8800 now.  Be prepared.  It's summer.  Be prepared because summer, you're out, right?  Yeah, but if you're on air conditioning, I'm going to tell you, Ultimate V ain't going to help.  You're going to need, like, things to hold on to each other.  It's great, though.  You're all sweaty, right, like a flippin' fly.  You slide right off.  You need Velcro.  Ultimate V.  You don't have air conditioning.  It's for the Ultimate O.  It's for the Ultimate O.  If you're into T-F-ing, you're into A-F-ing, if you want to F her face until you see all  over her face, Lewis.  Right? 
[02:39:00]  Lewis is blindfolding himself.  He's shaking.  Lewis, what if I told you, you could take Ultimate V, right?  Take your rock-hard P and you shove it into her A so deep that probably a spleen.  You'll feel a spleen.  And then, right when you're ready to see, pull out your rock-hard P and just see all  over her back.  And with Ultimate V, you could do that.  This is Dan.  You do it with Dan.  People say, Dan, this is his story. 
[02:39:30]  It's Ultimate V for the Ultimate O.  Exactly.  Right.  888-808-8800.  Call them now.  Anthony, really fast.  We're going to play What Do We Learn on the O&A show.  My story paled in comparison to that advertisement.  Is it true Kathy Lee exposed her rancid C and then Giff took out his shriveled P and  F'd her in the A?  Even if it didn't happen, that's great.  And Cody, then, I heard, got involved and Frank inadvertently C'd on Cody's face. 
[02:40:00]  Horrible.  It's Ultimate soup.  Wow.  Anthony, everyone on hold?  Yes.  What do they learn?  It's all about Lewis.  Right.  And really fast, as we finish the commercials here, Mike from Washington Heights, there's  no way I'm going to go see this guy at Governor's.  There's no guarantee he'll get to the punchline.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Don't come to Governor's butt, Lloyd.  This segment of Open Anathony is brought to you by the like-new Auto Mall.  It's the O&A show time to play What Can We Learn on the O&A show today. 
[02:40:30]  I want to thank Lewis Black, your stock by, making it even more educational than it usually  is, this program.  Thank you, Lewis.  It's like going to college.  This show.  Retard College.  Mongoloid U.  Well, we can start.  Should we go to the phones?  Yeah, we'll start with the phones today.  Jamie.  Yeah.  What's going on?  Hey.  It's Jamie from Jersey.  I learned it's okay to roast Jews on the radio. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Jamie.  All right, guys.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, buddy.  Let's go to John.  John, what did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, I learned Lewis.  I'm going to tell him, man.  Lewis, this is for you.  Feed up.  Opie hates backing cleaner.  I can't stand him.  Matt, what's up?  Feed up.  Hey.  It's Lewis' turn in the barrel.  Yeah, we're out of the barrel.  He's got a turn.  All right.  Thanks, Matt.  Thanks.  Let's go to Dylan.  They're all about Lewis today.  Dylan, what did you learn? 
[02:41:30]  I learned that Lewis cut.  I also learned that Stinky Crank fit on his bed and 100-year-old sack looks like melted  heat to heat.  Oh, very nice.  All right.  Wait a minute, guys.  All right.  Guy was paying attention all day.  All day.  He learned that you cut.  Lewis cut.  Finley from Brooklyn.  I learned that Lewis is easily distracted by sound bites.  Finley from Brooklyn.  Again, I learned that an SUV is okay to drive because it's smaller than a monster truck.  Stan from Hoboken.  I learned Earl didn't make the cut.  Troy from Jersey. 
[02:42:00]  I learned Leach's voice can make paint curdle.  Yes.  Curdling paint.  How did the Stinky Smuts go?  With that voice.  My arm.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I learned that Jesus helped Lewis blast with his putt.  It's a indication when we find out about Grace.  Well, we might have to find out about Grace very soon, right, Anthony? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Carolyn, what's going on?  Hey, I learned a few things.  First, I learned that the days of the 32nd radio promo are over.  Yes.  And secondly, I learned that Lewis Black's ancestors were in the U.S. 12 years when the Red Sox last won the World Series.  Oh, look at you doing that today.  Nice.  That's nice.  Go start.  Thank you, Carolyn.  Bye.  Bye.  Unbelievable.  Nice.  Let me see what Jason learned.  Jason, you learned something today?  No, I didn't.  I didn't learn nothing. 
[02:43:00]  I thought you lost what I was going to say.  I didn't learn what happened between Lewis and Caddy Lee.  No, you didn't.  We never will.  Sorry about that, guys.  All right.  Good luck.  Swago from Patterson, New York.  Today I learned that Caddy Lee had the rotten city.  Oh, Pat.  Pat.  Rancid.  Oh.  Eric, what's going on?  What's going on?  Lewis.  Hi, Roy.  Good.  Today I learned that Anthony used to work for a living.  That's right. 
[02:43:30]  I also learned that your impression of Lisa sounds like Mayor Quimby.  And does Stinky's roommate wear a puppet on his hand that he calls Mr. Hat?  Come here, Stinky.  We had a couple about Stinky's roommate.  What was that one you said?  Uh, oh, what the heck was it?  Yeah, I don't have it with me right now.  Stinky's old roommate.  Oh, that man ass is like catnip.  Right.  For Stinky's roommate.  Stinky lives with a pedophile. 
[02:44:00]  I don't know if you were listening yesterday.  The guy turns into, what, Danish?  Is it Danish pedophile pages?  He's 62 years old.  He sits in the kitchen, the common kitchen of their apartment, and spanks it.  To, uh, pedophile porn.  They have a single bedroom where Stinky's bed is aloft on one side and the other guy's bed is aloft on the other side.  And we were just assuming that after Stinky sleeps, rolling around doing whatever he does in his bed, 
[02:44:30]  that when Stinky's gone, this guy gets naked, gets in Stinky's bed, and rolls around like a cat rolling on catnip.  You know, just like boy man ass.  You know, just, and just digging.  Nice.  He's got to get out of there.  Well, I feel better about my life.  What a roomie.  Wow.  Anthony.  Not quite the cast of friends.  Yo, what's up?  Anthony Lewis, what's going on?  Hey.  Yo, today I learned that last time the Red Sox won the pennant for the championship,  the statue of these grooves is still perky. 
[02:45:00]  What has it been, your rope swallower?  A rope swallower.  Hey, Mom, darling.  Got it.  Mom, darling.  I'm a rope swallower.  I'm a Twinkie.  I love that bit.  I'm a, yeah, yeah.  Mike, what's going on?  First, I learned that he'll be effing really, and that he could take his effing C and shove  it up his effing A.  Wow.  That's just thinking that's like a hyena.  Jennifer. 
[02:45:30]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Love hearing from the ladies.  How are you, Jennifer?  I completely learned more today about my ABCs than I ever did watching a Sesame Street.  Yes.  See, it's educational.  You should have saw Lewis's jaw drop.  All right, Jennifer.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Dan from Hoboken.  So I take my C and put it in my A.  Do you see a Muppet doing that?  Take your C.  That's your A. 
[02:46:00]  Dan from Hoboken.  I learned there's radio.  They're psychotic.  Then there's O&A.  Then there's Lewis Black having an aneurysm caused by cartoon voices.  Fuego from Patterson again.  Today I learned that Lewis will have his brain explode for a finale on his next show.  Which will be June 22nd.  I'll be Governor's at Levittown and the 24th in Medford.  At Medford's Governor's.  Gordon.  Here again. 
[02:46:30]  Does that really get you even over the phone, I don't think?  Yeah, yeah.  You don't think it's on a vacuum cleaner?  No, my mom looks like hot with her vacuum cleaner.  Wow, gee.  I wonder what I'll be on the show with next time.  Boy.  If you came cranking in here with a vacuum, he would lose his vacuum mind.  You've got to make it complete though.  You've got to get an old, ratty, blue bathrobe.  It won't be tough.  And I will jump out the window.  And the words you've got to say?  Feet up.  Feet up.  And then come over there by vacuuming under the feet. 
[02:47:00]  I learned Sam Adams was a father, patriot, and kid toucher.  Rich, what's up?  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, I learned today that, oh, it's all over when you pull out the liar, liar, pants on fire.  The big guns.  Thank you, trombone.  All right.  I love this part of the show because you realize people are actually listening to this.  It's amazing.  Also, I've been in New York, actually, if you're in the city, June 10th, Sunday, June 10th, in the Gotham.  Gotham. 
[02:47:30]  It's a part of the Toyota Comedy Festival.  Oh.  Which is always a lot of fun.  Unbelievable.  Woo-hoo, man.  No, it is.  No, it actually is.  Oh, my God.  It's an amazing amount of shows this year.  Frank from Babylon.  Babylon.  I learned that Opie hates Swiss-African woo-woo coffee.  Woo-woo.  That's pretty good.  I learned that Louis wants to advance his film biography beyond one line in Jacob's Ladder.  I didn't learn that. 
[02:48:00]  Sure.  I'm kidding.  Chris from Jersey.  I learned that you could say, stick your C in her C, then pull out and C all over her,  and everyone would know what you were talking about.  Woo-hoo.  Woo-hoo.  Hmm.  I learned I need to get skinny and wear a bow tie if I ever want to be a Delosho correspondent.  Dan from O'Bunkett.  All right.  That's about it.  Yeah, we got to go.  Yeah, because you guys have a rich full life.  Yeah.  Surrey, Bob.  Yeah, right back to four-hour meetings, Louis. 
[02:48:30]  You want to join us?  You going to another meeting?  Oh, nothing would give me more pleasure than coming into your legal staff.  That would be funny, having you just lose your effing mind in front of our boss.  They just make an offer, and I go,  just bark.  And then you'd say you'd have to bring me dog biscuits for me to actually talk.  But it'd be funny to just walk in and start, like, sniffing a crotch and then biting a pant leg.  That rock.

[02:49:00]  Easy.  Bar night at O'Donoghue's in Hoboken with Rick.  And Lisa.  And Lisa.  Yay.  Lisa with the lovely voice and stinky as well.  Rick, we're going to a morning.

Thank you. </pre>
