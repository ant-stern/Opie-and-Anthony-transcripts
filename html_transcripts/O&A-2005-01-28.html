<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a series of "We'll be right back" announcements, followed by rambling banter about an "O&A virus," neglected emails, and their aversion to lengthy correspondence.  The hosts then discussed the extremely cold New York City weather (5Â°F), with Opie detailing his frigid walk and a disturbing encounter with a seemingly hypothermic homeless man.  This led to a discussion about the plight of the homeless in such weather.  Opie also recounted his ongoing battle with mice in his apartment, culminating in a nighttime garbage pail expedition in his underwear to evict a rodent (or possibly several). He solicited listener advice on mouse extermination.  Listener calls followed, sharing their own pest experiences and anecdotes, including a prank gone wrong and a police chase of a raccoon. The show mentioned Jim Norton's Albany performance and that Rich Voss and Patrice O'Neill would be guest-hosting. Patrice was teased about his sexual exploits and sex toys, leading into a bizarre musical mashup and a sports update before Rich Voss joined the hosts in studio, the segment abruptly ending mid-sentence.

The second segment began with the hosts discussing their cold-weather commutes and clothing layers, shifting to Anthony's travel woes: a bad Detroit hotel and a long Newark airport taxi wait.  They discussed unlicensed taxi drivers, particularly at airports, sharing anecdotes of scams and near-scams. Rich Voss recounted a frightening taxi experience in the Bahamas, involving an unscheduled stop in a dangerous area, and another harrowing Nassau taxi ride.  Opie's upcoming Atlantis gigs and safety concerns regarding his daughters' beach trips were also discussed, alongside a brief mention of a murdered actress in New York City. A caller shared a similar Kenyan taxi experience involving drugs. The conversation returned to the murdered actress and the dangers of NYC bars, touching upon societal blame for criminal actions.  Humorous anecdotes about aggressive electronics store salespeople and their own voyeuristic attempts to spy on neighbors from a hotel room followed.  The segment then focused on "Celebrity Fit Club," specifically Wendy's emotional struggles with overeating and Mia Tyler's defensive attitude towards her weight.

The third segment opened with a darkly humorous scenario involving an obese woman, transitioning into a discussion about obesity and graphic descriptions of obese individuals, including mentions of Mia Tyler's weight.  A significant portion detailed the fallout from the hosts' prank announcing Boston Mayor Menino's death: the prank's escalation, media coverage, station management's attempts at damage control (including a pie-throwing idea), their firing, a failed photo op with a short general manager, and a bizarre visit to a children's hospital with pies.  They recounted their feelings about the incident. The conversation shifted to a "Teen Voyeur Bus" prank, their arrest, CNN's involvement, and the unexpected closure of 6th Avenue due to President Clinton's motorcade.  Another prank involving a false Pearl Jam concert in Jaffrey, New Hampshire was recounted, highlighting their escalating pranks and speculation about how far they might have gone had they not been fired. Rich Voss filled in for Jim Norton, and a CBS crew filmed the show for a segment on indecency (airing February 6th).

The fourth segment started with an apparent April Fool's prank involving Ezra from the *Improper Bostonian*.  Past pranks were recounted, including a Super Bowl ticket stunt involving a pizza parlor employee who was tricked into stripping and being filmed.  A musical interlude about Steve the Bear and XM Radio ads followed.  Mikey Biggs was criticized for complaining about a repeated segment. Rich Voss, filling in for Jim Norton, joined, and they discussed a planned CBS interview.  An unrestrained bit about Charles Kuralt's alleged extramarital affairs followed, filled with graphic sexual descriptions and crude humor.  An interview with Dallas Cowboys center Tyson Walters about his injury, the Super Bowl, and his experiences with the team took place, followed by a comedic bit about a gay male group orgy competition. More XM Radio ads aired.  A heated segment with Patrice O'Neill then transpired, detailing his frustrating experience with Master Poe, XM's head of security, who gave him an extensive security check, contrasting it with Tyson Walters' lenient treatment.  Patrice described Master Poe's intimidating demeanor and background.  The segment concluded with banter between the hosts and Patrice, focusing on his personal life, career, and a sexually charged trip to Brazil.

The final segment centered on a man detailing his Brazilian sexual experiences, graphically describing encounters with women and his use of sex toys (displayed in briefcases). The conversation became increasingly vulgar, focusing on the sex toys and the man's sexual practices, alongside concerns about AIDS. Opie, Anthony, and Rich Voss reacted with shock, humor, and disbelief.  A tangential conversation about a racial controversy involving a Hot 97 radio parody (whose producer previously worked with O&A) was also included.  The show ended with XM radio advertisements.

[00:01:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:01:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[00:02:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:02:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:03:00]  We'll be right back.

[00:04:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:05:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:05:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:06:00]  Wait, what? 
[00:06:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey, everybody, we're all going to be right back.  Hey, everybody, we're all going to get laid.  Did you see that jerk?  Don't just stare at it.  I'm scared of you.  I'm scared of you, sir.  I'm scared of you, sir.  You like Huey, I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protecting myself. 
[00:07:00]  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protecting myself.  I'm sorry.  I'm scared of you.  I'm scared of you.  I'm scared of you.  I'm scared of you.  You're stupid.  I'm scared of you.  Please call the police.  This calls for the old Billy Barule.  How would you like to blow my lawn? 
[00:07:30]  Huh?  Huh?  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  Hey, good morning, and welcome to the O&A virus spreading across America, thanks to XM Satellite  Radio.  Hello.  Big hi to everyone that got their XM Satellite Radios turned on overnight.  Yeah.  Got to welcome the new people.  Also want to say hi to everyone that's emailing the program.  Starting to feel guilty about that. 
[00:08:00]  A lot of email coming in, and not writing many people back these days.  No.  But I just want to acknowledge that we're reading every single email, and thank you, thank  you, thank you for your comments, and your feedback.  I used to write everyone back, but...  That's a little odd.  I know.  I just can't do it anymore.  Hard to do.  Because now it's just hundreds upon hundreds a day, and it's just out of hand.  That's why I just post on the message board every so often.  That way, if anyone's got any questions, they put it up there. 
[00:08:30]  You know, you answer it in some witty fashion.  And then you don't have to talk to anybody.  Because if no one knows where the message board is, then they're probably not that big  a fan enough to deserve an answer.  Nah, there's a lot of people that don't want to be bothered with the message boards, to  be honest with you.  They enjoy the show, and that's it.  And every once in a while, they'll go to opianthony.com and write an email.  I used to like copy and paste.  Oh, did you?  And then people started catching on to that.  I'm like, all right.  Dude, a friend of mine emailed me and said he got a letter from, an email from you. 
[00:09:00]  And it's the exact same thing, the exact same response.  Because I thought I was real witty, and I'd come up with something that looked like it  was to that person.  Yeah.  Oh, nothing.  So I would just quickly copy, paste, copy, paste, copy, paste.  And I would get through like hundreds of email.  Just stamping them out.  And you know, these bastards that listen to this radio program, they pick up on everything.  Of course they do.  So they blew that for me.  So now it's like, I write little one-liners when I can.  But I do read every single email, because we get a lot of good feedback from you guys. 
[00:09:30]  The emails, Opie, are just the subject line.  Huh?  The emails themselves are just the subject line.  No, I read most of the emails.  Most.  Most of them, seriously.  Yeah.  What happens if you write a really long email, forget it.  Yeah, I know.  I'll scan for some keywords, and then go, okay, you know, thank you.  Thank you for listening.  The trick is, get to the point quickly.  Because if I look at an email that's like a legal page long, buy, delete, click.  And no, you know. 
[00:10:00]  It could have the cure for AIDS on it.  Yeah, no offense to the fans.  I mean, if my family does that, or someone that works in Washington, same thing.  Yep.  Same thing.  If they don't get right to the point, I'm like, buy.  I'll scan and make sure it doesn't say, you know, you're fired, or.  Yeah, things like that.  Or meeting at five, you know, this afternoon, something like that.  Oh, I blow those off.  If I just go, I don't know, I didn't get the email.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Too long.  Oh, there you have it.  Too long, my friend.  I know you guys are sick of us bitching about the weather, but just for you people in the 
[00:10:30]  warmer climates, it's five degrees in New York City.  Five degrees.  Yeah, what'd they say, the coldest day of the winter so far?  Yeah.  With the wind chill, it's way below zero.  And, you know, I know there's people laughing at us in Buffalo, in Minnesota, and there's  parts of Canada that are illegally listening to the program, Anthony.  They're probably laughing at us.  But for New Yorkers, five degrees is just, just awful.  Hey, five degrees is cold.  I don't care where the hell you are.  You reach a point where it's just cold. 
[00:11:00]  Any colder, it's still just cold.  I was walking, I swear to you, I walked out of the garage.  Which is only about a block from here.  About a block and a half.  And I was looking for a cab.  I was like, I'll give the guy ten bucks to drive me a block and a half.  I cannot deal with this cold.  Couldn't find one, so I had to walk.  And then I was doing the one leg of my journey where the wind is hitting me in the face.  Oh, but it's only a block, block and a half.  Dude, doesn't matter. 
[00:11:30]  For two seconds.  It was the first time I actually felt the cold go through my jacket for a little bit.  Walking up that block.  And I have one of these arctic, you know.  I know.  Swear to you, I should be, mush, mush, mush.  Yeah, I know.  Your coat is hilarious.  Yeah, and I pull my hood up and I have a scarf that goes right up to my eyes.  And my jacket zips up over my nose.  So all you're seeing really is eyes.  That's all that's exposed.  They were burning.  The wind hits and just, you feel your skin burning from the cold. 
[00:12:00]  Can't stand it.  There's no reason, as we've said before, why we are broadcasting from freezing cold New York.  We should be in like, I don't know, Miami.  Well, we're going to be in Washington Monday and Tuesday.  Oh!  Well, that's not, I can't wait to walk around Washington and look at the palm trees.  Let me tell you something, though, Anthony.  Let me tell you something.  I've been studying the weather.  Have you?  It's going to be like meteorologist Opie?  It'll be about 10 degrees warmer in Washington. 
[00:12:30]  10?  Yeah, that's a big difference.  We're talking maybe.  15 degrees?  We're talking maybe as high as 45 degrees in Washington while we're down there.  Stop it.  That's a huge difference than what we're dealing with today.  Really, though?  So Monday and Tuesday we'll be in Washington, and then the following Monday and Tuesday we'll  be in New Orleans.  See, but you know what the problem is?  We're in Washington.  They will pick us up at our hotel in a car and drop us off right at the door at XM.  Right.  So it doesn't matter if it's warmer.  How much outside are we actually going to see? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, that's true.  I picture us hanging out in the hotel bar and going and doing the show, and that's pretty  much it.  Here, it's, you know, there's some trudging to be done in the cold, and can't stand it.  We really should be in Miami doing these shows in the winter.  And I jumped out of my cab this morning to see you across the street just staring at  me, and I'm like, uh-oh, who's that?  Is this a deranged fan?  I see a guy, I'm like, who's that, and what do they want? 
[00:13:30]  That's why I started waving all goofy when you got out so you'd know it was me.  I appreciate that, because, you know, it's weird.  It's really dark, and there's no one else around, and there are fans that kind of hang  out outside the building from time to time, especially when it's a little warmer.  They just want to say hi as we're walking in.  Those EMT guys.  Yeah, the EMT guys.  We get it, guys.  Hi, your fans.  All right.  Yep.  This is me walking into the building.  Hi.  I give them the wave every morning.  So do I.  So do I.  They're hanging out.  Maybe they should have checked on the homeless guy that had a urine stream that was frozen. 
[00:14:00]  I passed by this guy today.  He's, uh...  Did you see him?  Yeah, yeah.  I saw him.  Wait, you actually...  This isn't a story in the paper?  No.  This is just something you saw?  I saw.  I was walking.  Dude, and I cannot stress to the listeners how frickin' cold it is out there.  It is ridiculous.  Like any exposed skin, like they say, no exposed skin.  It could freeze in a matter of minutes.  I had my hands up in my sleeves and then in my pockets, because if it's out for a second,  it starts burning. 
[00:14:30]  You feel like that burning frostbite's sitting in.  And here was a homeless guy in one of the doorways of a building, not even on the heating  grate.  And he was, uh...  Because we have the grates here in New York from the subway, and sometimes heat comes up  through it, and a lot of homeless sleep on those.  This guy was just in a doorway.  Uh...  There was a stream of urine from him down the sidewalk, and it was frozen solid.  And he's laying there, you know.  And he could have been dead.  I don't know.  I'm not gonna, you know, hey, you alright there, fella? 
[00:15:00]  There's just some guy, you know.  Did you think the same thing?  You think he's dead, Steve?  Steve saw him.  Yeah, well, you pass by six or seven bums on any given day.  They're homeless, Steve.  Not bums.  Sorry.  It's 2005, for God's sake.  I'm crying out loud.  They're smelly bums.  Homeless.  And...  Hobos, you're gonna call them?  Normally.  That's one guy with a stick and a bandana tied at the end with all of his possessions on  it.  Yeah, normally they're actually sleeping on the grates, sometimes without their shoes.  Yeah, yeah, they take their shoes off.  You can assume that there's a lot of steam coming off, but when they're in the doorways 
[00:15:30]  like that guy, and the stream of urine is just frozen.  Yeah, frozen solid.  You can imagine that his innards are probably frozen as well.  That's what I was thinking, you know?  He had a pretty big jacket on, but you can't just, you can't lay on the sidewalk in this  weather.  Those guys...  Good enough to walk.  Those guys, most of them know how to survive.  Pretty hardy, are they?  Yeah, yeah.  You see their skin, it's not even human anymore.  It's like a leather.  It's like a leather type of material, man.  It actually does, turns into leather.  So, there you go. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, poor guy.  And then I'm bitching that I have to walk a block and a half before I come to the luxurious  XM Studios.  Studios.  We bitch that the studio's cold when we come in from our office.  And then we come in here and sit up, oh, it's freezing in this office!  And there's a guy, you know, a few yards away, sleeping in his ice-frozen piss.  We are horrible.  So, I got a, I got a, an apartment update, Anthony.  Ooh!  Yeah, another fun thing happened to me in my apartment this morning. 
[00:16:30]  More wildlife, is it?  Uh, well, thanks for getting right to the punchline.  I really appreciate it.  It's really, uh...  Sorry?  It's really gonna help my story.  I was just throwing some out there.  It could have been a java log.  Thank you, thank you, Anthony.  Thanks.  Oh, well.  No suspension left in this story.  Well, I...  I...  I...  I...  I...  Remember my brother the other day when he was passed out on my couch after his colonoscopy?  Uh-huh. 
[00:17:00]  You know, and the mouse was running around?  Right.  And I finally caught that mouse later that day after he left.  I told the whole story on the air.  That's what I was referencing.  It'll probably be replayed over the weekend.  That's what's cool about the weekend shows on 202.  It plays all the shows from the week.  Right.  So you can catch up in one day or two days.  Yeah, you really don't have to listen to the show during the week.  I hate to tell people that, but you can catch up on a Saturday and Sunday.  They just run it in order, right?  Yeah.  So you'll hear that story over the weekend, but he woke up from a daze and saying, you 
[00:17:30]  think there's only one mouse in this apartment?  Oh.  And that thought's been in my head the whole time.  So every time I go into my really cold kitchen that is blocked off from the rest of the apartment  by a door, kind of.  I have to open that door.  And I'm always just like...  No heat?  It's really cold in there.  I mean, there's a heater and stuff, but that's why this door is up just to kind of, you know.  I don't really need the kitchen being like kind of a bachelor dude, so, you know.  Right.  No cooking going on in there.  Not really.  I mean, a little bit here and there.  So, but every morning or at night even, I'm opening that and just waiting for something 
[00:18:00]  to be on the counter again or something like the last time.  Yeah.  And I swear every time, just like, oh, God, please, please, you know.  Sometimes making noise just in case there is, it can just scurry away.  And you don't have to see them.  Right.  So this morning, I go downstairs and I'm on the computer as my coffee's brewing.  It's 4 a.m.  I'm ready for a fine day of radio with my pal, Anthony.  There you go. 
[00:18:30]  Time to check the headlines, read a little email.  Start of a new day.  See if the Hot 97 crew got fired yet.  Right.  See if we're in the paper today.  You know, all the fun stuff we do every morning, right?  And then I'm like, ah, the coffee's done.  Ah.  Do, do, do.  Go upstairs all happy, you know.  Just in my long johns because I just, you know, rolled out of bed.  No shirt, no socks.  Ooh.  Which I'm, it's kind of cute.  The story, though.  That's the only reason I'm saying it.  So, uh, so I'm like, ah, coffee, you know. 
[00:19:00]  And, and yes, I did go in there and start the coffee maker.  And then I just closed the door.  So I'm thinking nothing of it.  All right.  Apartment's pretty dark because my eyes are still adjusting.  Do you do that in the morning, by the way?  Uh.  I have all my lights on dimmers.  Hmm.  And I keep it really, really low when I first wake up.  And slowly but surely, it's almost like the sun's coming up in my apartment.  And I, I, as, as that hour goes by, I'm like turning the lights up.  Turning the lights up more.  No, I'm not that calculated.  No, it's not even being calculated.  I mean, you know, when we first started doing morning radio, that bright light first thing 
[00:19:30]  in the morning in the apartment would kill me.  It would go right through me.  Yeah.  I try to keep it pretty dark, I think.  Yeah.  So it's pretty, so it's still very early.  So the apartment's very dark with just slight dimmers on so you can get to the, excuse me,  the dark kitchen.  And so I'm all happy, and I open the kitchen door, right?  It's a little oil, huh?  I'm getting ready to reach for my coffee cup, and I hear my garbage pail, rustling, rustling,  really loud rustling. 
[00:20:00]  Really loud rustling.  And now it's dark in the kitchen.  I'm there, and I'm like, oh my god.  The first thought was you describing a subway, New York City subway rat.  Yeah.  Because this is loud rustling.  I'm like, whew, whew, whew, whew.  Was the pail moving at all?  No.  Wasn't jumping around a little bit?  That would have helped the story, but no.  I'll tell it how it is.  No.  I should have said that.  But you heard it.  No, I heard it.  No, and the rustling was very loud, okay?  And I just had like a, I didn't have a garbage bag in there, because I just emptied the garbage 
[00:20:30]  last night, because that's my new thing, is emptying garbage every day.  Just keeping all food out of the apartment.  So, but I forgot, I had a little snack or whatever last night, so I had a little grocery  bag, you know, with a couple things, and that's it, at the bottom of the garbage.  So it was in there.  I'm like, oh my god.  And I'm thinking how you were describing these nasty New York City subway rats.  I'm like, the size of cats.  And I'm like, oh my god.  My heart went up into my throat again.  Yeah.  Now I have to turn the light on. 
[00:21:00]  I'm like, oh god.  I turn the light on, and I look into the pail, and sure enough, it is just, you know,  rustling.  I think it knows I'm in there now, and it's now just trying to get out, but it's kind  of like, you know, tangled in the bag, I guess.  I'm like, holy ass.  Now what?  So now I'm ready to be just the biggest wimp and just run away, or kick the pail, and then  run and let it just hide.  But I'm thinking, this is my opportunity to get another one of these things out of my  apartment.  True.  He's already trapped.  So I'm like, oh god, oh god, oh god.  So I pick up the little pail, and it's in there, and the rustling is really loud. 
[00:21:30]  I'm like, this effing thing is going to jump out of this freaking pail.  Oh, it'll be jumped out right on you?  Oh, that's what I'm thinking.  That's what you think, right?  It's going to jump right on you.  Which would literally, I'm not even kidding, I think I would have a heart attack.  You'd just die right there.  I would have a heart attack, and I still don't know what it is.  I don't know if it's a mouse, a rat.  So, I mean, there's no real great ending to the story, but now I have no shoes or socks  on, just long johns, no shirt, and I just grab my keys, and I'm just carefully carrying 
[00:22:00]  this pail.  I don't want to shake it too much, because I don't want this thing to totally panic and  get out of here.  So I'm carefully carrying the pail out of the apartment like it's a bomb or something.  I'm like, oh my god.  Get outside.  Obviously, it's five degrees.  I'm freezing my ass off.  Now I'm like, I need to know what it is.  So I just emptied the garbage right on the sidewalk.  You just dumped it out?  Oh yeah, now I'm just waiting for it to make its appearance. 
[00:22:30]  And unfortunately, there's no great end to the story.  And finally, mouse number two.  Did you see him?  Oh yeah, I saw him.  Yeah?  Mouse number two walks out of the, not walks, just finally runs out of the garbage.  So the first one had a friend.  And then I kind of chased it a little bit down the sidewalk, because I'm like,  I got, because you're an idiot.  You get these thoughts in my head.  You know, I remember you saying, well, maybe the mouse is going to come back into the apartment.  True.  So I'm running down, not running, but walking, you know, following it down the sidewalk a 
[00:23:00]  little bit as it's going over snow piles, looking at it like, is this the same mouse?  How would you know?  Oh, because I studied the last one, because remember he was staring at me from the TV?  Yeah.  And this one looked like it was smaller.  So I'm like, tell me there's just a bunch of mice.  There probably are.  And then you said in the office that when I was seeing the mouse, that one mouse, that  it was probably a bunch of them that I was seeing.  Could have been.  Yeah.  Maybe you weren't looking at one mouse.  It was probably like five mice in there that you're looking at. 
[00:23:30]  And now you're going to see them.  You're a ground floor guy.  So that's rough.  Well, here's the problem.  Ground floor guy, older apartment.  I mean, it's a really nice apartment.  It's a real old building.  And they did a lot of construction to the brownstone next to me.  I mean, a lot.  Drives all the road and town.  I mean, where the whole, my apartment was shaking all summer long.  Yep.  So I'm thinking they shook things up, which makes things want to move on.  Yep.  So obviously I've got to get the mouse traps now. 
[00:24:00]  You've got vermin.  Yeah.  I'm not convinced that that's it.  I've got two of them out so far.  Are you going to get the humane traps or the ones that snap their necks off?  No.  F no.  I want to hear that.  Bam!  In the middle of the night.  And no, you got one.  Oh, yeah.  The one that, then they all, they end up, it's so sick to look at the trap after that.  Sometimes maybe they just got a leg.  Sometimes it's like right across their back.  And sometimes it gets their head and neck where it crushes it.  You don't want to look at that. 
[00:24:30]  No.  It's kind of horrific.  All bloody mouse head.  My brother told me what to do.  He says, get the mouse traps and throw them in bags.  Makes cleanup a lot easier, he said.  Wow.  Because he, you know, I told you, he used to live on the Upper East Side way uptown where  it was just nasty.  You get like a paper lunch bag.  Yeah.  And you put the mousetrap in there.  Yeah.  With a little cheese.  Or actually my brother, he's like an expert.  Because he used to live, I told you, he lived with his rugby pals.  What a great idea.  And they had rats where they, you know, they were so drunk all the time.  They were excited when they heard a rat in their kitchen. 
[00:25:00]  They all just went hunting.  No joke.  And these are, you know, rugby guys that have to outdo each other.  So, of course, you know, they're not like me running away from a stupid little mouse.  They're like, watch what I could do.  Yeah, exactly.  Just getting stupid.  Right.  So, but he says peanut butter works the best.  He goes, oh, it's peanut butter, mousetrap, in a bag, no problem.  Clean up is a breeze.  You hear the snap or you look in the bag, you see something furry.  Yeah.  You just roll the bag up, throw it away.  Done.  That is pretty smart. 
[00:25:30]  Done.  Never heard of that.  Yeah.  Someone's saying I need a glue trap.  Now that's.  Those are disgusting.  Yeah.  Because now the mouse is trapped all stringy with the glue.  No, I can't.  I can't look at that crap.  No way.  Ben, what's up?  They come under your door, too.  They can get under.  You have to get the thing.  I have them on my door.  No, no, no.  You just got to go to the hardware store.  You've got to block any room under your door.  Because I had one.  That's how he got in.  They flatten out.  It's amazing.  Don't tell me that.  Are you serious?  That's all you got to do, though.  They'll never come back.  That's how they get in. 
[00:26:00]  You get a piece of metal weather stripping or something.  No, there's something between my refrigerator and the counter.  There's a space.  Yeah.  Because I once saw a really big one.  This is where it all started about a year ago.  I saw a big one.  And I think I brought it up on the show when we first started.  Maybe I didn't.  Or maybe I didn't.  Because I don't know the difference between the radio show and just hanging out with all  you guys.  We forget what we talked about.  We forget.  But it was when my brother was over with his family and left.  Oh, I told you all that with the stuff that all their food was laid out. 
[00:26:30]  And I went in the kitchen one day and there was a big one munching on the trail mix.  And I freaked out.  I left so fast that I thought it was a mouse.  But everyone's like, well, if you think you saw a mouse, it really means it's a rat.  Yeah.  But I saw the thing quickly kind of turn around and go between the refrigerator and the counter.  So that's where they're coming from.  Hole in the wall back there, maybe.  Probably something.  Yeah.  So I've got to get my loser landlord that could care less about making his tenants happy. 
[00:27:00]  I'm going to have to raise holy hell and get him in there.  Call an exterminator.  Yeah, I guess.  Get him in there.  Professional.  So there you have it.  Mouse number two has been caught.  Mouse number two.  We'll keep count.  I'm sure there'll be more, Opie.  Kind of proud of myself that I didn't wimp out.  Because I was like, dude.  When you had yourself, you were a little scared, though.  Oh, of course I was.  But, you know, I mean, the rustling of the bag is just like, oh, God, what is in this thing?  You were in more danger of being outside in just pants. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Be like those Alzheimer's people they find outside the house.  I read one out on Long Island.  Some, like, 88-year-old woman was found on the side of her house wearing a light jacket.  Oh, my God.  She probably thought it was, like, the 30s or something.  Let me put on my jacket and I'll go out.  It's, like, springtime.  She walks out all smiling.  Two seconds later, boom, sack of potatoes.  You bring up a great memory.  My childhood home is within, like, a half mile, let's say, of a nursing home. 
[00:28:00]  I know.  I've seen the plaque.  Opie's Childhood Home.  Yeah, sure.  And the nursing home, some of these older, you know, residents that had Alzheimer's would just take off, just start walking.  They start walking away.  And more than once, they would end up in front of our house.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I forgot all about that until you just mentioned that.  Oh, yeah.  Go home.  And you would either see them in just a light jacket or sometimes pajamas, you know, because it's, like, August or whatever. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  You know?  But they do that in the winter and they wind up, you know, freezing to death.  Or every once in a while, like, someone that works at the nursing home would start knocking on doors.  Excuse me.  You haven't seen any old people kind of just wandering around, have you?  We lost one today.  We're trying to find them.  Oh, God.  Old folks.  What a bitch that is.  Mike from Kansas.  All right.  Let's go to the phones.  A couple phones, and then we'll take a break.  Let's see.  Mike in Kansas City.  What's up, Mike? 
[00:29:00]  Hey.  I just want to let Opie know that you should cover every crack and crevice.  Those mice can squeeze through a hole the size of a nickel.  Yeah, I've seen that, man.  It's pretty weird looking.  These mice can get anywhere.  If you think your house is mouse-proof, forget about it.  Well, you know.  Under the door.  I get the traps today.  Simple as that.  You know, eventually they're going to get the hint.  When they start smelling other mouse death.  Mouse death.  Well, you know, these animals know that crap.  Mouse holocaust going on in Opie's house. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  All right, guys.  I'm punching out.  All right.  Thanks.  And then he put me out in the cold and let me sit here all night.  It was six degrees.  It didn't let me in.  Jeff in D.C., what's up?  There were paper bags with the corpses of my friends inside them.  Awful.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  Go ahead, Jeff.  You're going to set these traps?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Sorry.  You're going to set these traps?  I got to...  Roll tape, please. 
[00:30:00]  I have to see you setting a mousetrap.  Why?  You know how nerve-wracking it is to set those things?  No, I could do that.  Oh, no.  He hit it right on the head.  You got to get an exterminator.  Why do you even want to deal with this?  Yeah.  I dealt with this once, and I got an exterminator, and I got the things fixed, and I never had  the problem again.  Yeah.  It's disgusting.  You want to...  The bubonic plague, you know?  Yeah.  It's something behind the refrigerator.  God knows when we move that refrigerator.  Playing hide-and-seek.  Something behind the fridge.  Da-da! 
[00:30:30]  Go ahead, Jeff.  Hey, Opie.  You got to get the green bait cubes.  The what?  They're green bait cubes.  Bait cubes.  Uh-huh.  You throw them behind your refrigerator, behind the stove.  They heat this stuff.  If they've got young, they take it back to feed their young, and they literally hemorrhage  from the inside.  And they die in the walls, and you smell rotting mammal.  That's what I was going to say.  That's why I don't think I could go the poison route, because now you've got the smelly  dead corpses.  Dead mouse in your walls. 
[00:31:00]  They're back in the wall.  You won't find it.  Yeah, you'll smell it.  Yes, you will.  Dead, rotting meat.  Yes.  You've got to get them out of there.  All right.  Thank you, Jeff.  All right.  Punch it out.  Bye.  Let's say hi to Brian.  Hey, Brian.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  First of all, it's freaking cold out here.  I'm like an hour away from New York, and it's minus 15.  Yeah, Lurton Island.  It's minus 15 degrees any time.  Where are you?  But mice.  Where?  Yeah.  I'm at Brownwood 17 going towards, like, Nanuet.  It's like an hour away.  Oh, my God.  It's brutally cold up that way. 
[00:31:30]  Anyway, I had mice.  I used to live in Newburgh.  And first of all, I'd hang out in the stove.  I actually had some food out there, and my girlfriend was staying over for the night.  And, like, I came out downstairs, and, like, the food's all eaten.  I accused her of eating the food.  And she's like, I didn't eat the food, but it was a freaking mouse.  So what you do is you take some coconut.  I know you don't get out to the store much because you're a bachelor and everything.  But if you happen to go past by a grocery store, grab a coconut.  Take a piece of coconut and, like, toast it with a match.  Put it on the mousetrap. 
[00:32:00]  And guaranteed you'll have a mouse.  Guaranteed.  Ah, peanut butter works.  Yeah, all right.  What kind of scumbag are you that you're bitching at your chick for eating food?  No, she was bitching at him, right?  Oh, she made a mess.  I think he was bitching at her for taking the food.  Really?  Like, were you eating the food?  Dude, how much?  What, were you stranded somewhere?  And what?  How much did the mouse eat that you're bitching that your chick was eating it?  And is your chick anorexic?  Because what?  You're noticing that a tiny little dime-sized piece of food is missing?  You get fat. 
[00:32:30]  I'm leaving you, bitch.  Right.  Would you have a scrap of bread, you bitch?  What an animal.  All right, I figured I'd share.  We don't have to talk about mice.  Mice.  You know, that's...  I hate meeses.  But, you know, it's an update.  Mouse number two has been caught.  Yep.  And I just...  Now I'm convinced there's at least another one, if not more.  Good luck, you city dwellers.  It's so odd, well, now.  Good luck.  I adore the suburbs.  You know what I see as far as wildlife?  I'll see a little squirrel outside on my porch. 
[00:33:00]  Or I'll see a bluebird in the tree.  Whippoorwill.  Whippoorwill.  Or then I look.  Oh, what's...  It's a little kitten is walking on the porch.  I think I'm going to take him out a piece of my chicken I had today.  Yeah.  That's the wildlife I like.  I don't like city cockroaches and mice and rats cohabitating with me.  I haven't seen the cockroaches lately.  I had a couple of those, too.  Oh.  But this is all normal stuff for a New York City apartment. 
[00:33:30]  They scurry when you turn the lights on.  Yeah, it's a little...  So you don't see them as much as you would a mouse.  Yeah, it's a little creepy, the cockroaches as well.  You know what the worst...  When I was living in Brooklyn, man, I'd be on the computer, you're sitting there, and  then out of your peripheral vision, you just see something kind of move.  That's right.  Yes!  And you look, and stuck on your wall is a cockroach.  Oh!  And the way they move, just...  They're so fast and disgusting.  The little antennas moving around. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, God, you can't catch them.  They're gone.  And they'll disappear into, like, your couch.  Or all of a sudden, they're gone by your dining room table.  You don't know where he went.  Might be under there.  Might be in between, where you put the extra piece in when family comes over.  Yeah.  He's just hiding in there, eating the gunk that collects in there, waiting to poke his  head up during dinner.  All right, all right, all right.  Hi, big city cockroach here.  What's for dinner?  You have a...  You have a disgusting mess.  You have a way of describing things, man. 
[00:34:30]  I don't like them.  It is a true talent.  Thank you, Opie.  It really is a true talent.  When I lived in that apartment...  How many people can give me the heebie-jeebies about how you describe things, man?  I give it...  You ever play hopscotch walking down the street on a summer day where you're walking and all  of a sudden these huge cockroaches are just winging back and forth along the sidewalk.  And I'm not even talking about the ones you even see in your house, which are big.  But these things on the street, they're like the homeless cockroach.  They're just these huge things on the street that are walking over. 
[00:35:00]  We went out one night, me, my girlfriend, friends that included other girls and stuff,  and they're wearing these open-toed shoes.  And one girl actually had one walk over her open-toed shoe.  And a scream that you'd only hear in a horror movie just comes out.  And what happened?  I'm picturing, you know, a gang of five people with knives stabbing her.  No.  Cockroach.  Oh, she didn't yell, what are you going to shoot me? 
[00:35:30]  Oh.  We'll get into that story next.  Tragic.  Horrific.  More animals on the street.  Really fast being that.  One time waiting for a subway.  Yeah.  Rat bumped into me.  Bumped into you?  Swear.  Like you're shoulder to shoulder?  Oh, sorry, pal.  No, I'm on the platform, and just like you described, you know, sometimes these creatures  get displaced, and they start just scurrying as fast as they can.  Well, something was going on with this rat, and it just, you know, zigging and zagging,  you know, hit me in the leg, and then jumped down onto the tracks. 
[00:36:00]  Wasn't going to take a nibble or anything, but just wanted to get back into hiding or whatever.  Nope.  I don't know where it came from, but all of a sudden I just felt, boom, something hit my  leg, and I look, and it's just in time to see it kind of go over the ledge into the  tracks.  I'll take a little raccoon in the suburbs.  You see your garbage pail rattling around a little bit?  You go to check it out.  What pops his little head up?  Oh, he's wearing a mask.  Look, it's a little raccoon.  Our pests are adorable out in the suburbs, aren't they? 
[00:36:30]  Little raccoon.  The ugliest thing you get is the possum walking around.  It looks like he's perpetually smiling.  Hi, I'm a possum.  I'm just going back to the woods.  Just came out for some of your suburban trash that's outside of your house.  Fine.  Take a little away with you.  Not these big, disgusting rats and bugs.  Yuck.  Well, we got a lot of phone calls coming in now, so.  Should we?  They're giving me the heebie-jeebies just reading some of them.  All right, now let's go to Mike, the trucker. 
[00:37:00]  Go ahead, Mike.  Hey, guys.  What's going on this morning?  Hey.  I had a horrible mouth story.  We pulled a practical joke on a buddy of mine in college, and the end result of the practical  joke was because of mice that we introduced into his car.  He's the kind of guy that his car, you know, he always had a bunch of trash and, like, fast  food shit in the back.  All the guys that just throw it over their shoulder.  Please don't tell me this story ends with death.  He's forging ahead with the story, Opie, not stopping even for us talking. 
[00:37:30]  That's fine.  Go ahead, Mike.  Well, anyway.  The listener's heard, and now they're waiting.  I'm going to find feeder mice and putting them in there, and apparently they were breeding,  whatever.  He was driving across campus.  One of them jumped up, like, on the headrest, and it scared the shit out of him.  He wrecked his car, and the dude's, like, in a wheelchair.  He's paralyzed from the waist down now.  Nice.  Funny joke.  Damn it.  I don't have my laugh button today.  Yeah, well, you know, the guy was a real cocksucker, so it doesn't matter anyway.  Wow, that's really... 
[00:38:00]  For a few minutes, we kind of felt bad about it.  Scummy thing to do.  All right.  Anywho.  All right, guys.  Question?  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Let's go to Ryan.  Hey, Ryan.  Hey, Owen.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Make it fast.  We've got to take a break and move on to other things here.  Okay, man.  I just had an apartment in Kansas City down by the plaza.  I used to go downstairs at night, and I'd hear all this rustling around, you know, so I  know what you're talking about.  So, oh, anyway, I set up these mousetraps down by the kitchen, and these great big holes 
[00:38:30]  I thought were, like, for pipes or something.  Anyway, the traps would be gone the next morning.  They'd be gone.  Anyway...  The trap would be gone?  The trap would be gone.  That's a rodent with attitude, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Someone's going to teach you a lesson.  Oh, God.  Stealing the traps.  I tied, like, a wire to it and hooked it to the wall.  Yeah.  The next day, it was in there.  It was in the wall. 
[00:39:00]  So I pulled on this thing, and this dang chihuahua-looking leg was on there.  It chewed its own leg off.  Oh, wow.  It was a rat.  Chewed his leg off.  And there was a morning when I went downstairs.  I opened up the door, and I had a dog, and so I had, like, the dog food and everything  sitting over there.  I opened up the door, looked in there, and there was one sitting on the dog food eating.  And I look at him, and I'm like, excuse me, and I shut the door, and I just walked back 
[00:39:30]  out.  Yeah.  Just leave him.  You know, let him eat.  You can call me a wimp, whatever, but I guarantee there's a lot of tougher guys than me out there  that have been, you know, scared S-less by these rats and mice and stuff.  Never want to deal with them.  That's a good story, Ryan.  Punch it out.  Rat can't stay down with three barrels in him.  He's got a wire tied to the trap, and it drags it right into the wall.  Oh, my.  He chews his own rat arm off.  That is heinous. 
[00:40:00]  You know what?  I'm getting a hotel tonight.  I'm not going to be able to sleep in my apartment.  Oh, what would you do if you woke up and something was in the sheets with you?  Nah.  Nibbling at your toes or just cuddling up for warmth by your feet?  Oh.  All right.  My apartment's going to be 100 degrees starting tonight.  I would lose my mind.  I can't have anything, like, even touching me.  You know, if something brushed up against me while I was sleeping, I would lose my mind.  I would scream. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  Let's get one more in before a quick break.  Jim in the Poconos.  Go ahead, Jim.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I work for the phone company.  When we're in lower Manhattan in downtown Brooklyn, you can shine the flashlight on the wall in  some of these basements, and the walls move.  Yeah.  It won't be in cockroaches, man.  It's like, you want to talk about, it freaks you out.  That's what it comes down to is the easiest way to put it.  And I got a real quick one before I punch out.  Did Ricky take care of his mustache? 
[00:41:00]  Oh, where's Ricky, the new intern?  I think he did.  We told him no facial hair on the Opie and Anthony show, unless you're Anthony.  All right.  I'm pointing out, guys.  Have a good day.  All right.  Here's Ricky.  Ricky, what'd you do to your mustache?  Everyone's very, uh...  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  I trimmed it a little bit.  You kind of got a thin Billy Dee Williams going, which is good.  But it's shorter in on the sides.  Very pencil thin, yes.  It's shorter in on the sides, almost, uh, if it was thicker, like Hitler-like.  It tapers out.  I guess it's about a quarter inch high, right in the middle, and then it tapers down to zero 
[00:41:30]  at the end of his mouth.  Only foreigners could wear mustaches like that, by the way.  Oh, God.  It's very smooth.  Very Ricky Ricardo.  What nationality are you?  I'm El Salvadorian.  Yeah.  El Salvador?  Yeah.  He's got the...  Born here, though?  Yeah.  See, if I had that mustache going, I mean, I would look just completely ridiculous, but  it looks fine on you.  Thank you.  And he's got his hair cut.  He's all set now to intern for the Open Anthony program.  Oh, yeah.  All right. 
[00:42:00]  Very good.  There's the update.  He trimmed it all nice.  There you go.  Can you imagine sleeping, and you're sleeping with your mouth open, and a roach comes in  and starts feeding on your teeth and thumbs?  All right.  Oh, and you wake up like, what?  And a big roach is in your mouth?  Oh.  I want to move on, but Chris has a story here.  Chris, go ahead.  Hey, I'm a cop, and me and my partner got dispatched to a call about a raccoon in somebody's  basement, and we got there and opened up the door, and all of a sudden, this raccoon jumps 
[00:42:30]  out at me and my partner and chases us out of the basement.  Chased you?  Scared the shit out of me, man.  I've never been so scared in my life, even on robberies and stuff like that.  You don't know what those things are going to do, and they will attack you.  They'll come running out after you.  Raccoons, yeah.  That's why you just look at them through your sliding glass door. 
[00:43:00]  That's it.  Look, he's all cute.  Sometimes you get deer out there in the suburbs.  You look out in your backyard.  Hey, look, it's Bambi.  Yeah.  Yeah, but those things jump through glass sometimes.  There's a story.  Every year, a deer going through someone's glass.  Running at full speed into a sliding glass door.  And now they're stuck in your place, just wreaking havoc.  Bleeding all over everything.  There was a story this week.  Maybe we can find it, or someone can send it in.  That exact thing.  Oh, the old guy?  Yeah.  Inside the house, and a buck ran into his house and started trying to have sex with him. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  This big buck was grabbing him with his hooves and trying to have sex with him.  Do you have the actual story?  That was this week, right?  Yeah.  How did we miss a story like that?  How do you go through life, and it ends up you're getting raped by a buck in your own home?  Ow!  Knocks him off his little rascal.  Maybe he saw him on his rascal and thought it was another deer or something.  Yeah.  All right.  That's horrible. 
[00:44:00]  Why don't we play a mash-up, take a quick break, and then we'll go to the phones.  The phones have exploded today, so we'll take some more calls.  We've got lots to do today.  No, you don't mean a lot of calls are coming in.  Because of maintenance around here, the phones actually exploded, and we need them fixed immediately.  You know how things are?  Yeah, I hear you.  By the way, Jim Norton is in Albany.  He is?  I didn't even know he had a gig.  Did he plug it at all this week?  That whore?  So Norton's doing his comedy thing all weekend long in Albany.  Do we have the plug?  Yeah, it's just right here. 
[00:44:30]  Don't fret, though, that Jim's going to be absent from the show.  Yeah, we have a bang-up replacement coming in.  Well, we've got a couple today.  We've got Rich Voss coming in in a little while.  Yep.  He did a great job filling in for Jimmy last time, so we're giving him another shot.  And then Patrice O'Neill's making his first appearance on the new radio show, Anthony.  Patrice hasn't been here yet.  And I guess he's bringing in all his sex toys that we have discussed on the show.  All the ones he takes with him down to South America.  To Brazil, right?  When they go to Brazil to have sex with the prostitutes down there. 
[00:45:00]  It's all the toys he takes.  He's not just a guy that goes down there to have sex.  He brings these crafted glass dildos with him and uses them on the women down there.  He's bringing a swing.  No way.  Oh, he's also got his swing?  He's bringing a swing.  See, we should get a girl down here to check out the swing.  If you're in the area and you want to check out a sex swing, it doesn't mean you have to have sex.  Yeah, with Patrice.  Yeah, we'll see them all lining up out front.  You know, they all goof on each other, but they're all the same. 
[00:45:30]  They're all as perverted as the next guy.  Like, Patrice will goof on Jimmy about the yellow treats and the laying down and letting women dump.  But he's just as big a pervert.  Taking these glass dildos.  What's wrong with just having sex?  Jesus Christ, these guys are weird, man.  All right, yeah, Norton's going to be at Comedy Works in Albany, right?  Tonight and tomorrow?  Yep.  Is that how it works?  Because he'll be in Washington with us on Monday and Tuesday when we broadcast live from the compound.  Thank God no one knows what hotel we're staying at. 
[00:46:00]  518-689-0490 if you need tickets to see Jim Norton in Albany if you're in that area.  As we go to break, it's Zeppelin getting together with the Beastie Boys.  I think this is pretty cool.  Check it out.  Yo!  All your jetties and TV at it.  Don't mean to death, don't mean to bring static.  All your cleaners in your grandma's house. 
[00:46:30]  Grab your fast street friend and get loud.  Pulling doors off inches.  Grab you with the pitches.  And no, I didn't retire.  I'll snatch you off with the needle-nosed pliers.  Pulling through the land of the ice and snow.  Or the midnight summer of the hot spring.  Oh!  Back in to the overhaul.  What do you know we've never seen before?  Gliding in the glazes.  Like Lord Peter, for your way.  Like a face that wake the pace of.  Not a gloomy like therein' a hazel.  I'm a good, I hate your night with.  Can't just be running, let you know all right. 
[00:47:00]  The amber of the gold.  We'll drive our ships to new land.  Fight the horn.  Sing and cry.  Valhalla, I am coming.  We may call no love, but my form ain't fast.  So what's up with that?  I got friends if they believe that I respect.  When I think I'm too good, they put me in check. 
[00:47:30]  You don't believe when I say I'm no better than you.  Except when I rap, so I guess it ain't true like that.  You'll end your just a star.  Guaranteed to make your boxy bra.  Check it out.  What's it all about?  Work it out.  Let's turn this, turn this party out.  Check it out.  What's it all about?  Work it out.  Let's turn this, turn this party out.  So that's what's the condition.  I'm a man that's on the mission.  Son, son, you'd better listen. 
[00:48:00]  Stuck in your ass is an electrician.  Like the scientists.  When I'm applying this.  Method of control to my mind.  Like I'm trying to rap the two cool crap.  Make a name of a man that wasn't here.  And all of you don't want that fast appeal.  So I'm calling Salucci.  Son of a potato.  Check it out.  Throw your mind, but you won't see it later.  Cause I wear magic like a magician.  I add up the mess, but they shut the bank cashier.  Engineer.  I wear cotton and I don't wear gear.  Oh, it's sweet.

[00:51:00]  It's the Pac-10 today  Watch the bowls, man, watch the bowls  It's the Pac-10 today  On XM Satellite Radio  Today is Friday, January 28, 2005  I'm Scott Fleischer  With the Pac-10 today  Like father, like son  Kennedy hands the ball to Hernandez  20 seconds on the shot clock  Inside, shot, Brunfeld  And he gets the two  And he was fouled 
[00:51:30]  Possible three-point play  That call comes courtesy of Stanford University Athletics  Dan Grunfeld, the son of former NBA player Ernie Grunfeld  Is lighting up the Pac-10 this season  He ranks second in the league in scoring  And has been pivotal in Stanford's turnaround  Following an 0-3 start in conference  Dan's development from last season is astounding  After averaging under four points per game last season  The junior guard is now averaging just under 19 points a game  His recent performances have garnered him Pac-10 Player of the Week honors  In games against UCLA and USC 
[00:52:00]  He's shot just under 57% from the field  Including 67% from three-point range  Dan has helped form one of the most threatening backcourts in the Pac-10  The emergence of Chris Hernandez has gone hand-in-hand with the emergence of Dan's play  In the game against USC last week, the two combined for 40 points  Dan's father Ernie played nine seasons in the NBA  He now serves as general manager for the Washington Wizards  Ernie is the second leading scorer of all time at the University of Tennessee  Dan grew up with his father serving as an NBA executive 
[00:52:30]  Ernie was general manager of the New York Knicks  Then the Milwaukee Bucks  This was before taking over as president of basketball operations  For the Wizards in 2003  Dan is now creating a name for himself on the other side of the country  As he continues to help Stanford rise up the Pac-10 standings  And that's the Pac-10 today on XM Satellite Radio  XM 202  The OPN Anthony Show  Hey, we're back with the OPN Anthony program 
[00:53:00]  Thanks for tuning us in today  Hello  We must say hi to Rich Voss 
[00:53:30]  Who has entered the studio  What's happening?  Looking very, very cold  What is wrong with you?  Brutal  It really is  And you know what?  People work outside in this weather  Yeah, I know  There's people right now that have to get up and go outside  Actually have to be out there  And do this crap  I mean, you know  Is that incentive enough to go back to school or do something, you know?  Kill yourself  Who would do this?  Work out there  It's one block and a half walk over here  I even had to put my cigarette out 
[00:54:00]  I said, I can't smoke  That proves that it's really cold  If you're not smoking  But he's wearing  He's got like a windbreaker  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  I didn't know  First of all  You didn't know it was going to be cold out  No, I knew it was going to be cold  Listen, I got a car  I travel in a car, you know  I don't like to put a big bulky thing on and get in my car  Yeah, but you get in a freezing cold car  That car is not nice and heated when you get in it  I mean, it looks like your face is frozen  You don't have gloves  You don't have a hat  He goes, the snot's coming down now 
[00:54:30]  He goes, I don't have a hat, but I have earmuffs  I do  I put earmuffs and I finger myself as I walk down the street  To keep my hands warm  I have gloves  I'm lucky the earmuffs were in the car  I got another coat at home  Is one of the muffs really stinky?  Because it's like rubbing on that ear of yours?  It's melted, the bottom part of it  One stinky muff  I have ski socks on  Anthony and I were just discussing  I wear long johns until April now  Yeah, you got every day long johns  You had about the same distance walk that I have when I come here 
[00:55:00]  You were over at the hotel  I was at the garage  And there's one leg of the journey  I was saying earlier  Where the wind is coming right at you  In your face  Yeah, you got to dress better than  I wear that in June  What he's wearing there  I'll wear on a June evening  If it's a little chilly  Yeah, but it's a designer coat  It's five degrees out  Who cares if it's a designer coat?  Designed to make you freeze  I know  Designer coat  Who cares?  I have another coat at home  Which I'm going to put  What, are you going to break out when it's 10 below? 
[00:55:30]  I mean  When do you break out the other coat?  Oh, when it gets really cold out  Yeah  When they send me to the Russian front  I'm at the Chuckles in Alaska  My teeth  And you know when it's cold  When your teeth are cold  And my teeth are cold  And these aren't the smallest teeth  Right, right  You can feel it in your teeth  It has to be cold  If your fake teeth are cold  I know  Jesus  It was  I was  When I flew  I was in  When I had this dumb storm over the weekend  Where everybody panics  Like they haven't seen snow 
[00:56:00]  I flew home from Lansing, Michigan  Which was brutal out there  17 hours  17 hours  To get home from Michigan  On Sunday  You had to lay over in the airport?  In Detroit  In Detroit  So I went and got a hotel room  In some, you know  Crack hotel  Which kind of  Sort of bringing up bad memories  Of course now  You know  But at least I had money in my pockets  I just did a gig  You know  I'm not dropping it  And then you get back to here  To Newark  And I had to wait for a cab  45 minutes outside  Standing on the cab line 
[00:56:30]  It was  You know when you look for the  You know when the guys  That you get off a plane  You have a ride  And they go  Hey, you need a car  And you can get away from me  You know  I should tell the cops  That you're here  Doing this illegally  You know  And now I'm looking for one  You know  I'm sniffing one out  Because they're all foreigners  Nowhere to be found  We've talked about those guys  In the past  The best is they have  Is it Logan Airport?  Yeah  Or is it whatever  I think all the major airports  Have it  Have it now?  Yep  They have the big signs  That say  Don't accept a ride  From these guys 
[00:57:00]  And they have  A picture of two guys  Yeah  Yeah  They're smiling at you  Going hey  Need a ride  And they got the little  Like ride hat on  And they're usually  A little foreign and stuff  Yeah  And standing right next  To those signs  Are guys that look  Exactly like  The guys in the picture  Asking you for a ride  Yeah  They're trying to make  A few bucks  They're not sanctioned  By the city or anything  So they don't want you  Getting in there  Because you know  It could be anybody  It could be people  That want to rob you  Yeah  But see that's not the case  They just want the business  They want the money  Yeah 
[00:57:30]  I mean these guys  Yeah sure  It's a little shady  But they just want  To make a living  That's it  It's not like  There's serial killers  Hanging out at  LaGuardia airport  Yeah  You know  It is weird though  Because sometimes  I remember once  I got bamboozled  I like taking  Sanctioned transportation  I don't want to get  Into a vehicle  With someone  I have no idea  Who they are  What they're doing  You know  They're not licensed  Insured  You know  Stuff like that  And they'll come  Right up to you  And go  Taxi sir  Taxi sir  And you're like  Yeah  You're looking for a taxi  They grab your bags 
[00:58:00]  And they start walking  And they walk right  Past the taxi stand  And they're like  Okay follow me  And you're way  In the back  In the parking lot  There's some car  With some shady  People smoking pot  Like wait a minute  No this isn't a cab  You bastard  You bamboozled me  And then he's got  Your bags  So you feel like  You can't say  Hey sir  I don't want to  Ride with you  Because you know  He'll do a  Feats don't fail me  Now and take off  Right  So you're kind of stuck  And you wind up  Getting in the car  With these people  And then they're driving  And you're like  This isn't the way 
[00:58:30]  To my home  Hey  Shut up  I just have to  Make a stop  Okay  I'll be right back out  No I want  I wanted to go home  And this guy's  Picking up a kilo  To put under my seat  You know  Bastard  And it's Rich Vaughn  I told you the time  I thought I was  Going to die  In Nassau  Right  The Bahamas  Yeah  We went to this restaurant  And then we were  Going back to the hotel  We left the resort  Which is just stupid  Yeah  Absolutely stupid  Never leave the compound  When you're in the Bahamas  In that area  Dump 
[00:59:00]  And we get a cab  I think I told a story  On the air  And they're so laid back  And slow down there  That we jump in this cab  And all of a sudden  I'm thinking to myself  This isn't the way  Back to the hotel  What is  And then you start thinking  Oh my god  Was this a legal cab  Was  Mister  Right  This isn't the way home  Dude  Barely speaks English  Got the  You know  The dreads  The Jamaican music  Is cranking  And then like  The president of  The Bahamas  Is having some kind  Of press conference  He always is 
[00:59:30]  Every time I go down there  And I'm in the cab  They're listening to  Some president  Giving a dress  Yeah  And all of a sudden  I mean the roads  Start getting darker  And darker  And it's kind of industrial  Now do you mean  What do you mean darker?  I mean a few things  There's not many street lights out  Anthony  And what was the driver  Smoking a big blunt  He's going  He's going  It's all good man  No he was  He was kind of a weird dude  You know  And then  I'll get to that part  So then we're in  Like an industrial section  We pull into a parking lot 
[01:00:00]  And all of a sudden  The guy just gets out  Oh great  Oh my god  Is he getting one of his  Accomplices to rob us  Come out there  Rob you  Yeah  And all of a sudden  We're just sitting there  Like what are you going to do  It's not like I can get out  And run for it  Because I don't know  Where they're lying  You're in a bad neighborhood  And then I'm kind of taking a peek  And he's just  Ha ha ha  Yeah I'm on  He's having a conversation  With his buddy  Oh my god  And then they light up a spleef  And they're smoking  And I'm just sitting there  Patiently waiting  You know  What am I going to do  What are you going to do  Complain  And then I realize 
[01:00:30]  I'm probably going to be okay  That he just needed  To socialize with this guy  Yeah but  Maybe make a drug deal  Oh I know  I'm watching the meter  Just kind of  Tick  Tick just slightly  Nothing  Nothing too drastic  What a set of balls  It probably cost me  An extra five  Ten dollars  No big deal  You know  But I'm watching it tick  Because there's nothing else to watch  And then 15-20 minutes go by  And the guy  Comes back into the cab  And drives us back to the resort  You didn't ask him  Like hey  No  Who was that  Then I was asking people  What was that about  I was asking people 
[01:01:00]  Like back at the resort  And they're like  That's how it is down here  People  It's not like New York  Where everyone's in a hurry  You know  They go about their business  Oh yeah  They're working sort of  But you know  He knew he was passing his buddy  You know  Between the restaurant  And the resort  And he's like  Oh good opportunity  To stop by  And socialize a little bit  And have a little pot  Unbelievable  Yeah but that's when you're scared  That the country's going to be overthrown  Or something  Right  Yeah the president's on there  You're making a speech  They're ripping across the casino  Throwing the slot machines out  You're hearing gunfire 
[01:01:30]  In the background  Of the president's speech  On the radio  What the hell  And you hear it outside the car  What the hell  I love the death ride  From the airport  To the resort  You know  They got these beautiful resorts  Down there  You go there  Everything you could possibly  Want or need  And you get the death ride  On the way there  It's some nut in a van  Doing 800 miles an hour  Down some windy road  On the wrong side of the road  Yeah  Or you think it's the wrong side of the road  Until you realize  Oh wait  We're in like  England or something  It's like a province of  What  Oh okay 
[01:02:00]  We're allowed to  Okay good  Frightening  But at first you have no idea  You think the guy's just high  On some kind of  Freaking you know  Rum or something  That's why I'm taking my kids  Is that  Where's the Atlantis  Is that the Bahamas  Atlantis is Bahamas  You see  Before they built that  When you went down there  There was  There wasn't something nice  That's like a compound  You go there  And you're completely  You don't leave it  You don't leave it  No no  You want to feel like you're down there  But you're still in Connecticut  That was still being built  Very good  That was still being built  But there was some nice restaurants  In that area  That's why I went over there 
[01:02:30]  I took  When I was married  I swear  I took my wife to Aruba  I went to Aruba  Which is probably  One of the most expensive places  You'll ever go  I'm serious  We were in some hotel there  La Cabana  And there was a little store  Downstairs  And we walked downstairs  To get even just like  A loaf of bread  You know  Now we're making sandwiches  In the room  Where at that point  You know  I lost money in the casino  Of course you did  And so  So  It was seven bucks  So it was  You know  And we get home  And the day we get home

[01:17:30]  It's a little  It's easier than it would be  If Chris just said  Write me a joke  Yeah  You gotta come up with something  That's a movie  And I would bet money  You haven't really  Seen a lot of these movies  I saw that horrible movie  The other night  And this has nothing to do  With the Oscars  Because that movie  Open Water  Oh where they were  See now that's  That's one I want to see  I hear that it's really good  It's one of those movies  People either love it  Or hate it  It's based on a true story  They died at the end  Who told the story  Did like an arm  Like float up on shore  You know  Did they die in the end 
[01:18:00]  You didn't know that  No  Well they're straight out  It is based on a real story  The shark ate them  It's a creepy story  Because we were talking  About scuba diving  I think earlier this week  And I've done some diving  And you know  They didn't get a head count  Right  Everyone popped back up  Out of the water  They just took off  And there was two divers  Still down  Well they took a head count  But they did it wrong  Because one went in  And then one went back out  Or something  And you know  You know how they count  Either way  Either way they left them behind 
[01:18:30]  And you know  When you go to some of these resorts  And go diving  And it's not just offshore  Sometimes you're out there  For a good hour  On a boat  They're way out there  Beer and sangria  Everyone's drinking  And how would you know  How to go  Which way to swim back in  You don't know how to swim  You know  You're not swimming back in  From an hour boat ride out  Oh no  I guess not  That is horrible  See what you do  Is you hope your partner  Gets eaten  And you float on top of them  It was really  There was some good parts  In the movie  Don't get me wrong  You're like  Like that 
[01:19:00]  You know  I mean  It's you know  It wasn't like some surfer bro  Getting back on  Without an arm  This was some scary  You know  Alright  You know  This girl's surfing  But she keeps going right  But some people say  That that couple  Is still alive  They're saying  They're still alive  Some people say  They might have dramatized it  For the movie  Some people say  They wanted to kind of  Just disappear you know  And fake their own deaths  Oh they're  Supposedly some of the  Scuba gear was found  On like one of the  One of the islands  In the area  Like a deserted island  Or something like that  But how do you fake 
[01:19:30]  Your death  If a boat leaves you  Do you lay it out  In the ocean  You know  This is the time  This was their  This was their plan  The couple was actually  Tupac and Biggie  It was them that were diving  And they faked it  It could have been their plan  You know what I mean  We're gonna  And then the people  Would assume  Oh my god  They got eaten by a shark  Or something  You know  Ooh  Now  That's the sequel  There's been some  Suspicion about the story  Is all I'm saying  A lot of people say  They're definitely dead  But then there was 
[01:20:00]  Supposedly some  Scuba gear  Happened to be on  This one island  Or something  They're wondering  How it got there  Or whatever  Yeah  Never heard that  It's a creepy thing  We gotta go back  To the Kenya guy  Cause this guy  Oh Chris  Yeah I'm here  Oh you're  The one that  Talked about  Called in about  The Kenya cab ride  Right  Yeah  And you swear  That you're not lying  It's not from  The Amazing Race  Alright  If anybody wants  To verify it  I was with

[01:22:30]  Right  No one comes down here  It's so trendy  But I know about it  I'm so hip  And cool  And  And they  They build these places  In the middle of crap  And what winds up  Happening  Is it's  It's  You know  The zebra  Out on the plains  Of the Serengeti  They leave these clubs  And they're out  In the middle of the wild  For some lion  To sink their teeth  Into the jugular  They see him limping  The limping gazelle  Coming out of the bar  And it's over  Yeah I mean 
[01:23:00]  It's like  Look at her  She's a little  Martha Stewart  She's gonna walk  Down the street  You know  People are walking  Up to her  With gimmicks  Hanging out of their arm  And syringes  You know  Yeah  It's  How  Normal people  Don't go to those places  And then when you're  Coming out of a bar  Your walls are down  Anyhow  Because you already  Had a couple of drinks  Had a couple of drinks  Now you're like  Hey what are you  Get out of here  What are you gonna do  Shoot me  And the gun was  In plain sight  And they're asking for money  Just give the money  The gun was being used  To beat her fiancÃ© 
[01:23:30]  Yeah he's got  About the face  He's got a nice black eye  And a bunch of stitches  It looks like  So they  You know  Beat him a little bit  Shoot the fiancÃ©  She dies right there  In the street  These animals  Animals  Animals  She was an actress  Or an aspiring actress  Wow  I think she had done something  This is more of the story  The actress's boyfriend there  Or fiancÃ©  He saw the mugger  But he didn't see the gun  So he didn't take this guy seriously  So he tried to push past him  Uh oh 
[01:24:00]  At that point  Using both hands  He hit me in the face  With the gun  Sparks said  Sparks  Sparks  Sparks  Is that his name  Sparks  Uh  Jeffrey Sparks  The grieving fiancÃ©  Said he and his friend Scott  Did he's herky and jerky  And maybe the guy thought  He was going for a gun  Right  Started walking away  Thinking the trouble would pass  But as they did  The man tried to grab the purse  Of this actress  And  That's when  Okay that's when  The boyfriend said  What are you trying to do 
[01:24:30]  No she said it  Oh well they got  Okay you're right  Yeah yeah  And she said  What are you going to do  Shoot us  Didn't he get hit by the  Didn't they hit him over the head  With the gun or something  Yeah they hit him in the face  With the gun  And then ten seconds later  A shot rang out  I turned and I saw  Nicole on her back  On the street  And uh  And that was pretty much it  I like how we read news  We're not getting jobs  At CBS  And then what  He hit the guy in the head  What Ben  What did he do  And then the guy said  No the girl said it  What  Oh and then 
[01:25:00]  And then Ben comes over  Didn't he hit the guy in the face  Yeah we said that already  And then Eric will walk in  And go hey  Are you guys going to get to the story  Of the actress getting shot  Back to you  We are the worst  But that's why you guys  Listen to us man  This is the sad story  Now they're going to do a movie  And he's going to play  He wasn't even an actor  Yeah  You know she was her whole life  Trying to you know  Get a gig  And all of a sudden  And he'll wind up getting a gig  He'll get a gig  Or sell the story  You know to it  And the thing is  Why there's such reverse discrimination  In this country  You know  Those weren't four white guys 
[01:25:30]  That shot her down there  But if it was the other way around  If four white guys  Shot a minority  It would be all over the paper  White people shoot  You know what I mean  It is all over the paper  What does it say  It says  It's on the front page  It's on the front page  Of every New York newspaper  Well it has nothing to do  About race  Yeah but if it was  The other way around  It would be race involved  It would be white people  You know I mean  I don't know  I have no idea  What is going through  A person's head  When they can just  Unload on an unarmed 
[01:26:00]  Woman  Yeah  In the street like that  Over  You know they wound up  Stealing a couple of credit cards  And some stuff  Out of her purse  You know she's laying there dying  They're rifling through her purse  Dumping stuff on the street  And grabbing stuff  Animal  There is no redeeming value  In these people  There is no reason  They should ever be kept alive  It's disgusting  And the fact is  When they do catch these people  There's some scumbag lawyer  Will come out and say  How it was horrible 
[01:26:30]  How they were raised  And the poverty  And the abuse  That they must have suffered  And that's why they did it  If society would help these people  It would  Blah blah blah  Please  You know  You gotta just kill these people  Yeah  They will never amount to anything  Murderers  Rapists  And thieves  That need to just be wiped out  Well Anthony  It costs less money  To just throw them in jail  Yeah  Yeah  Exactly  Good  Who cares 
[01:27:00]  Who cares  They don't have a right to live  At that point  But  But you know what  Up in Harassdown  That area  There's a lot of great restaurants  And then you go all block  And it's just crappy  It's because they want to be so trendy  Look where we're putting a restaurant  Look where our bar is  We found this  This diamond in the rough here  Ooh  I'm so hip  I know about these  Cool places to go  You know something  Screw it  I'll go to TGI Friday's  In Times Square  That's where I'm going  Pally  I know it's safe  Oh you think

[01:28:00]  And there were guys getting shot  In there all the time  Yeah dude  Wow  It's still a pretty serious problem  All these tourists have no idea  That there's all sorts of turf wars  Going on  As they're shopping for their trinkets  I'm serious  I guess then  It's the safety in numbers thing  Because I figure there's so many people around  The odds that you're going to be  The gazelle that gets its throat ripped out  A little slim  As if you're the only one  By the watering hole  Right  Right  Yeah that's  You're right  That is the difference  When you're in Times Square  Yeah you're safe  Because it's  You're in a pack  In numbers as they say  Sure 
[01:28:30]  Have you ever gone into  One of those electronic stores  In there  And you just say  Say you want like  A little mini district  Or something  They're like 100 buses  They're like 1200 there  Because they think you're from France  Right  And you're going to spend  All your money  If you buy anything  In a New York City electronic store  I know  You're out of your mind  Look it  It comes with three shirts  I would  And they have these  Huge window displays  Yeah  With like  They'll show  They'll have a computer  In the display  And it'll be like  10 bucks  Yeah  You're like wow  And that gets you in there  And then yes my friend  What do you buy my friend

[01:30:30]  And kind of seeing things going on  Women naked  Walking around and stuff  And we figured if we had binoculars  This would really rock  So we go to one of these stores  That sell like cameras  Binoculars  Optics  That's where you got the whole bid from  Yeah  I remember the guys like  It was a real cheap pair of binoculars  Very good optics  Very good optics my friend  All of a sudden they're not just binoculars  Right  Fine optics my friend  He wanted like $200 for him  And it was obvious that  There's no way  And just like we just said  I think we said  Hey man no  We won't pay more than $70  And I'm like

[01:41:30]  Mia  Last week you weighed 210 pounds  We set a weight loss target for you of 4 pounds  Tonight  You weigh  205 pounds  Wow  A whole 5 pounds  She took her makeup off  That's one good dump  This is all that is  You feel it  You think about it  It's a good start 
[01:42:00]  Yeah  Congratulations  Thank you  Marissa  You get lots of work as a plus size model  I do  You look beautiful  Your husband adores you  I have to ask you this  Why are you here?  What's your motivation?  I'm not here to get thin  I don't ever want to be thin  It's not about being thin  It's about being healthy  So I'm trying to  As much be here for myself  As be here for the rest of the world  Who's watching this show  So Mia  Yes  He doesn't like you the way you are  Yes  Do you think he's going to like you 
[01:42:30]  Once you lose weight?  Yes  As much as he does  Why you fat?  Yes  Really?  Wait, would you call me fat?  Fat  So you're telling me that  Girls my size aren't sexy  No, I'm not saying  I'm saying  I think he'll like you a whole lot more  I think you have issues  I think you've got more issues  With your body size  And being fit  And you care too much  I think that's not good for your head  I think you need to lighten up  And be a little easier on yourself  Me being this size  Doesn't make me any less sexy  I could be 800 pounds 
[01:43:00]  And I'd still be sexy  You believe that  You could be 800 pounds  And be sexy  You  It's in your head  It's not about your size  I feel crap  You cannot stand there and tell me  If you weigh 800 pounds  You would be sexy  I'm saying people like you in the world  Who say people aren't sexy like me  Being my size  That's what causes people to be bulimic  And anorexic  And want to go get their noses done  And their lips off  Girl  There's nothing wrong with being yourself  Shut up  You said I condone that  That's how it seems  No  No  You tried to say last week  You tried to tell me last week 
[01:43:30]  That it seemed like it was okay for me to starve myself  I guarantee you gain 800 pounds  You would not look sexy  That's what I'm telling you  See there's a million people in this world  That would say otherwise  And I could give a f*** what you say  Your target weight loss  For the next two weeks  It would be 8 pounds  That's fine  How delusional  Well she took the wrong angle  Because she should have said  Well look  You're a black male  And I'm a white chick  You like me heavy  You know  Don't  I mean they like heavy chicks  That's right  But why do you think she's a brat 
[01:44:00]  You know  That she said  You could just tell in her attitude  That she was like  I don't know  She got her way growing up  You know  Yeah  And this whole  This whole thing where  She's saying you could be 800 pounds  And be sexy  No  You could be a freak  To some pervert  Who is beyond chubby chaser  There are guys out there  That love  Monsters  Big fat  Jabba the Hutt  Monsters  Laying on the bed  They're not humans anymore  They're literally a monster  And you get on there 
[01:44:30]  And just  Give them one  That isn't  Her being sexy  To this gentleman  That's her  Being the monster  He needs to get off  Because some problem  He had when he was two  That he has to  Look at this  This mess  On a bed  Practically oozing  Over the side of the bed  Where you could tuck  Her side fat in  With the cushions  With the  With the comforter  And bang her  That isn't because  She's sexy  And because the guy  Finds her sexy  She's delusional  Waiting for the  Waiting for the  Teamsters to show up  So you can have a day

[01:48:30]  Look I understand  Everyone is  Born with like  A body type  You know what I mean  And then it's really  Up to you  To try to stay  Within that range  I'm talking about  The people that  Understand their body type  But then just get  Completely messy  And out of control  You know what I mean  There are people  That are bigger  We've said this  On the show  I've seen women  That are a little  Overweight or whatever  But they're still  Sexy and stuff  Because they do  Try to take care  Of themselves  They try to keep  Their weight down  Into that body type  That you're born with  Dress for it  Dress for it  And just  Yeah exactly  But then there's 
[01:49:00]  Others that just  Completely give up  It's like  Ah I'm fat  So I might as well  Just keep getting  Fatter and fatter  Yeah  That's what happens  And then I reached  500 pounds  You know I was always  A big girl  Ever since I was  Two when my parents  Had twins  I was always a big girl  And then they ask  You know well  When did it really  Start being a problem  Well when I reached  600 pounds  It's like oh  550 wasn't a problem  It's always like  That line  Yeah  600 I realized 
[01:49:30]  I wasn't able to  Move around as much  As I used to  What  It's mental problems  And like  Mia Tyler was saying  That isn't sexy  It's never sexy  And then they  Ever see  And they wear  The halter tops  And their stomach  And the gut  Is hanging over  Their genital area  The thighs  You can't  They're sitting  And their legs  Are spread apart  Because they can't  Even close them  Because that big lump  Of midsection fat  Is hanging  Wonderful  Yeah that's sexy 
[01:50:00]  Mia Tyler  800 pounds  Is very sexy  It's  Be real  It's sexy  But little kids  Walking by going  How much is that  In the window  And do you ever  See a fat person  And they get  Their belly button  Pierced  Oh that's good  That's real nice too  That's a real  There's an attractive  Sight  Draw attention to it  That's only because  I'm at the beach  So the metal detectors  Can find your fat ass  You horrible  Walking mess  And on stage  Last night  I was tracing  This big fat guy  He comes walking  And I mean  He was gigantic

[01:51:00]  Like if you're going to goof on  Yeah go ahead  Goof on the skinny person  They need  They need a little  You know  A little ribbing  Every so often  Because they're accepted  And loved in society  And the fat person  Isn't  Because  They're a pain in the ass  When you walk into an airplane  And you look at your seat  And see a fat guy  Sitting in the seat next to you  It's like  You just go  Son of a bitch  Why  Why  Lose some weight  Now it's inconveniencing me  Yes

[01:52:30]  Ever since they booted those big fat people off the plane  Yeah good for them  I'm not talking  These are not people  I'm not saying that somebody that's 300, 325  Miss America  We eat good  I overindulge  We all do  You ever see somebody so fat  It makes you angry  Like you want to grab them by their 12XL shirt  How did you get so fat  And I'm talking in the area of 700, 750  You ever see somebody so fat  They sit on the couch  Their legs stick straight out 
[01:53:00]  If you have legs like baby arms  Change your eating habits  And of course  We're such a pathetic, litigious society  You know  You sue for everything now  They're suing the airlines  You know  We don't think we should have to pay for two seats  Yeah well I don't think I should be uncomfortable  Because you're repressing childhood rape memories  With pure fat and carbohydrates  You don't want to pay for two seats

[01:54:00]  It does hurt  And a family torn apart  And it makes you feel really funny  Right after it happens  The War of the Kumias  I have a yelling parents too  Grown up until they got divorced  And it was just, you know  And then you'd see like the old man  And take the plate full of spaghetti  And throw it  And it would hit like the wall next to the phone  And you're sitting there horrified  Watching the spaghetti slowly go down the wall  Get the fuck out of the wall  Fuck you  Oh, horrified kids  Did that actually leave? 
[01:54:30]  After the fights?  Uh, yeah  A lot of times, sure  And then, you know, you'd be able to go to sleep  Because the yelling would stop  First mom would have to wind down a little  You know, even after dad left  She's still going  Eat that shit like I need a fucking hole in the head  I'm trying to sleep  He's gone  Son of a bitch  Shut up  Come in here  Shut up  No way  Oh, God  He's been gone a half hour  When would he come back?  The next day?  Yeah, like the next day  You know, they'd be sitting down  Watching like Ronan Martin's laughing  Laughing  Everything was fine 
[01:55:00]  You know, and then out of nowhere  You'd hear the rumbling  You'd be in bed  And you'd be like  And then you'd hear from the kids' room  Can't you two just shut the fuck up for like one night?  And then we were pretty young  So, you know, we got, you know, called into the room  And mom sits down and goes  Me and your father  I want you to know  And I want you to know it has nothing to do with you  We're divorced

This Sunday morning  This guy wants to take credit for doing the footage of that  Or the bird's just chirping in a tree  Because it's early spring  And you just sit at home with your coffee  And your New York Times  Yes, I read the New York Times on Sundays only  And you sit there like  Ah  You feel all good about yourself

[02:08:30]  We know a little bit  About Boston  Don't we Anthony  Of course  From the improper  Bostonian  Ezra  Ezra  Yes  Hello  Ezra is calling in  Because he wants to  Talk to us about something  I don't know  I don't know what it was  Something about pranks  In Boston  Or something like that  Yeah I'm working on a story  On pranks in Boston  And I want to talk to you guys  A little bit about your  Your April Fool's prank  Involving Mayor Menino  And how that unfolded  Oh I don't know  What you're talking about  Alright  Well we decided 
[02:09:00]  Just to do it  During the show  Because we were very busy  With the CBS crew  Today after the show  So we figured  This was better than nothing  Alright cool  So the story's about  That particular prank  Or pranks in general  Pranks in general  In Boston  A lot of them  Involving the colleges  But  What kind of other pranks  Are there  Harvard Lampoon  Has pulled some good ones  Yeah  Like kidnapping  Jon Stewart  And things like that  But  Kidnapping Jon Stewart  What about the year 
[02:09:30]  They put the car  On top of that  That dome there  Oh yeah  MIT's big  On putting stuff  On top of their dome  Yeah  One year it was a car  One year it was a  Huge  What was it  Like that  That thing you put on  Stupid people  That  A dunce cap  Like a dunce cap  They put a dunce cap  On top of the dome  Oh MIT is just known  For their sense of humor  Those guys are a scream  Yeah they put a cow  From the Hilltop Steakhouse  Up there  But  That's about as far  As they've gone 
[02:10:00]  I guess when you're  Not getting laid  You know you've got  Plenty of time to do  Do plenty of other stuff  Yeah  Be you  Time to assemble  A cop car  On the roof of the dome  Yeah Boston College  Just laughs at MIT  Like  We're getting laid  Every night  While they're doing  Silly stuff  Yeah  Meanwhile  Who's going to be  Making all the money  When you get out  You know I'll tell you  I'll tell you about  A prank that involves  My brother's  One of my brother's  Best friends  He was going to  I think MIT  And the Charles River  Froze over  This actually made  People Magazine  And it was 
[02:10:30]  My brother's  One of his best friends  Growing up  And they took  His whole dorm room  And put it out  In the middle  Of the Charles River  I heard about that one  When it iced over  I mean everything  His bed  His desk  Just everything  He had in his room  Jackasses  Jesus  And that made  People Magazine  One year  Back in the mid 80's  I guess  Or something like that  So  What's his name?  David Cook  I believe  Cook  Yes  That's a good one 
[02:11:00]  Well you want to know  About the mayor thing  I want to know  About Menino  And specifically  The pies  I'm curious  About that whole aspect  Of the story  Are you serious?  Retribution  That was  That was the  Retribution phase  Of that prank  You know how  Every April Fool's  The jocks get on the air  And start trying  To pull gags  On their listeners  I don't know  Any listeners  That actually  Fall for this anymore  They're the dumbest  Things like  Look we changed  Format  And they'll play  Like five Elvis  Songs in a row  And say  We went all Elvis 
[02:11:30]  Or they  They say  If you look out  Your window at noon  You'll see a meteorite  In the sky  They try to get  Their listeners  To do things  Or another radio station  What's that little  Hill in Boston?  There's a little  Hill in Boston?  Yeah what is it?  Blue Hill or something  What is it called?  Beacon Hill?  No not Beacon Hill  It's more  No it's more  In the sub  Scandal Hill  It's more  Scandal  It's more  It's more  In the suburbs  Of Boston  And one radio station  Claimed that it was  An old volcano  And it was going to erupt 
[02:12:00]  It's going to erupt  Oh Blue Hills  Right yeah  Yeah alright  That was another one  And then  You know  Your five dollar bills  Are no longer  Usable  They're worthless now  That was a good one  So that throws  Everyone in a panic  Like what are they  Going to do  With their five dollar bills  What about the other one?  And my wife was killed  By a black guy  Was that an April Fool's gag?  That was an April Fool's  I believe  And then I'm going to  Jump off the Tobin Bridge  Yeah that one  Was pretty elaborate  You've got to love Boston  I love the racial sensitivity 
[02:12:30]  In Boston  Thank you  Oh look at that  So yeah  We decided  Well actually  Opie decided  He always says  I blame him for things  That get us fired  But this one is totally his  But you can speak up  Any time  That's what I don't get  Because then I'm looked at  As the psycho  I was brand new  To radio  Brand new to radio  Just been in it  For as long as we were  At WAF  So I was just damn  Happy to be there  I wasn't making any waves  I liked my job  I didn't want to go  Back to construction  I woke up in a really  Bad mood  And there was no 
[02:13:00]  Dog around to kick  So I'm like  I know what I'm  Going to do today  Get Anthony on the phone  Instead of doing  Instead of doing one of  These lame April Fool's  Gags  Or listening to the  Other jocks  And their gags  We figured we'd just  Blow the whole thing up  And say  That Mayor Menino  Was dead  And see how far  We could take it  Knowing it was  April Fool's  Knowing that  The context of our show  Is not a news show  So no one's really  Going to take it seriously  And we'll just  Kind of have fun with it  And totally take that  April Fool's gag 
[02:13:30]  To the umpteenth level  So Ope calls me up  And suggests we do this  I'd just woken up  As usual  And I'm groggy  So I'm like  Yeah sure whatever  And we get in  And we started  The ball rolling  Just kind of got on  It took a while  Because we kept  Looking at each other  Going are we really  Going to do this  You are such a  Professional broadcaster  With a mouth full  Of pop tart  I'm sorry  Yeah  So I think it was  About an hour  Into the show  We kind of teased  That we had news  About the mayor  And then we decided 
[02:14:00]  We looked at each other  And went alright  Let's go  Give it a shot  Let's do it  And then  We had a fake news report  We had some guy  With a real good  Deep radio voice  Who's actually  Still doing radio  In the New York area  We never ratted him out  He put together  Like this fake news report  Guy on the scene  At the mayor's  Car wreck  He said that he  Wrecked in his car  Now the problem was  He was on a plane  Back from Florida  At the same time  We had done this  So no one could  Get in touch with him  To confirm that he was  Dead or alive  So it kind of had 
[02:14:30]  More legs than we had hoped  And  You had no idea  That was going to be the case  When you  No we didn't know  We knew he was out of town  But we didn't know  He was going to be on a plane  On his way back  During this whole thing  And the story got progressively  More ridiculous  As it went along  Like at first  Like at first it was just  He was in an accident  Then he was killed  And then he was also  With a young  Loatian boy  And a prostitute  Like it really  We just made it  Get more and more outrageous  Patrice is here too 
[02:15:00]  Patrice O'Neal  It's a party today  Yeah  He's carrying two briefcases  That have sex toys  Sex toys in them  By the way  How much is that  In a window  Oh Jesus  That is not appropriate  Look at him  Sorry  We are just a big man  Yeah so  We had been doing that  I guess  It lasted about an hour  I guess  And we started getting  Complaints coming in  Our program director 
[02:15:30]  Started getting phone calls  From the mayor's office  Saying to stop this immediately  They didn't find it very funny  And we didn't stop it  Yeah I don't know why  But he came in  We didn't stop it  Bitched at us  Told us to stop it  We didn't stop  We kept it going  By the end of the show  I think the news  Had already started  Picking up on it  Oh my god  There was already a crawl  On TV  A crawl on TV  About  Our prank  The next day 
[02:16:00]  We were back on the air  And the news now  Full force  About how the mayor  Was so pissed off  That we had done this  His family  Had heard that he was killed  And were upset  Now meanwhile  We were on like a  It was a hard rock station  I mean really  Teens and young men  Were all that was listening to this  I doubt the mayor's family  Was really paying attention  Or taking it seriously  You know  Yeah you can switch to BZ  Up there in Boston 
[02:16:30]  And not hear a word about it  But Opie and Anthony  On WAF  We're breaking the news  About the mayor  Right  So  It just  It snowballed  Which these things do  If you saw what happened  To Hot 97 down here  With that tsunami song  Things snowball  The press gets a hold of it  And forget about it  Nothing looks worse  Than something that was funny  In the context of a show  Written out with quotation marks  Around it  In a transcript  It totally  Changes the whole mood  Of what was going on 
[02:17:00]  So the mayor thing  Blew up on us  The press got a hold of it  Ran with it  And the mayor decided  That we had to go  In order for him to stop  I don't know if he could have  Brought an FCC complaint  Against us  I doubt it  They say that  You're not allowed to get on the air  And do anything that will  Take away emergency resources  Like police or fire  It's called the hoax rule  The hoax rule  Yeah it really is  Named after James Hoax I believe  Who first did it  No it's the hoax rule 
[02:17:30]  Which uh  No hoaxing  Yeah  You can do hoaxes  You just can't  Have it interfere with emergency services  Like police or fire  They were saying that  What we did  Did take resources away  Because the mayor  Being the head of the city  In charge of police and fire  A little stretch  But they were going to try  To hit us with that  As far as the FCC went  The mayor said  Look everything will be fine  If you just fire these two guys  They did a week long investigation  On who was involved  Aside from us 
[02:18:00]  Who else was responsible  Program director  General manager  And it ended  How we knew it was going to end  With us  Being brought into a conference room  At the beautiful Colonnade Hotel  And told that our contract  Was being terminated  Yeah they terminated us  They didn't fire us  We thought we were going to get killed  Actually  Yeah  A mafia looking dude  Looked at us and goes  Sorry to meet under these circumstances  But we're going to have to  Terminate your contracts  Now what you were talking about  Happened in the interim  Between the time  That we did the prank  And were fired  The people were scrambling  At the station 
[02:18:30]  To try to save our jobs  One idea  That our program director  Dave Douglas  Who was just a tool  Had  Was  To get a hold of the mayor  Tell them we have an idea  How to smooth things over  They'd have us  Go into the middle of town  Get in those old  Older time stocks  That they used to put people in  That were bad  In the middle of town  And the mayor  Would then throw pies  At our faces  And this would solve everything  Is this the worst radio idea ever  That has hack written all over it 
[02:19:00]  So we hear about this  And me and Opie then go on the air  Because they actually let us on the air  For a couple of days after this prank happened  And this is  Again  It's textbook  It's what happens  When DJs screw up  Management will let them go on the air  The very next day  Because they're hoping it blows over  Then once the press gets a hold of it  It is over Johnny  You are off the air  Suspended they call it  Right up until  You're fired  And by the way  When you're suspended  You're already fired 
[02:19:30]  The company's just figuring out  How to contractually  You know  Pay you  And who's going to replace you  So  You're already fired  So they figured  They would throw pies at us  We got on the air  After we heard this idea  And  Just said no  There is no way  And this is after our boss was telling us  This is what we're doing  We're going to smooth things out  Oh they already  They already bought the pies  Pies  It was on like a forklift  I mean they even bought way too many pies  There was hundreds of them  Hundreds yeah  And it wasn't like  It wasn't like  They ordered the pies 
[02:20:00]  And did they consult Menino on this  Did Menino agree to hit you with pies  They were grabbing at straws  They were like  Oh  Get the pies  Order the pies  Alright then we'll go  I'll talk to Menino  He's got to say yes  They were freaking out  They were so stupid  They were just convinced  That the mayor  They didn't have to talk to the mayor  He was just going to agree to this  And it wasn't  They were like  Well as long as you've got some pies  Yeah and it wasn't  It wasn't the old school pies  That you see on  Some of these old TV shows  Where all of a sudden  Someone gets pied in the face  A pie tin with whipped cream  These were real pies  That would do damage man  Frozen 
[02:20:30]  It was like  Literally frozen apple pies  Right  They could have to  With disc it at your head  They couldn't even get  The real pies  Did you say disc it  I said my disc  Or whatever  It's a discus  Whatever discus  Discus  You retard  Discus  Discus  The producer over there  He threw a triscuit at him  The producer from CBS  Is just amazed at your stupidity  He's having such a good time  In that corner  We're leaving him alone  But he is just amazed at you  Every time I look at him  I think it's Joe Franklin  First of all 
[02:21:00]  I screwed up a couple words  Because I'm under a lot of pressure  Here today  Joe Frankel  Frank  I can't wait to see his story  And you're not even  You're not even one shot  It doesn't matter to me  When I'm at the Oscars  In a couple weeks  I'm going to call  Yeah and Norton  Is just beyond  Bummed out today  He's like  I'm missing the one day  That you guys are getting  National TV  Jimmy Norton  A huge part of this program  And he's not even here  For you know  And bumble lips just came in 
[02:21:30]  Yeah  We got this guy  I made two mistakes  A couple  What did I call it  A disket  A disket  Yeah  So getting back to Ezra  From the improper Bostonian  Who's on the phone  Writing a story on Boston pranks  Yeah  They also like  Hired a PR firm  To try to smooth things over  And one of their bright ideas  Besides  This is after the mayor said  Hell no  Well no  Well pie thing  There was two other things  Besides ordering the pies  For the mayor  They decided that  They needed a photo op 
[02:22:00]  With the mayor  Shaking the hand  Of Bruce Mittman  Who was the general manager  Of AAF at the time  Who was a midget  In real life  He's like 5'4 I think  Very short man  So they hired a photographer  And they got the mayor's schedule  This is a true story  And the midget  We love the guy actually  We love and hate him actually  Yeah  He was kind of in hiding  Behind a bush  And the mayor comes out  Of one of his things  He was doing that day  And Bruce Mittman  God love him man  Comes running out of the bushes  With the photographer in tow  And just grabs the mayor's hand 
[02:22:30]  And starts shaking  Like hey  Mayor Menino  Pleasure to meet you  Doesn't even really say  Who he is or anything  And of course the mayor's  Like shaking his hand  And the photographer's like  Ka-choo  Ka-choo  Ka-choo  And now they want to get  That picture on the Boston Herald  With the caption  See the mayor's okay  With AAF  Here's a picture of them  Making up  Mayor and AAF  General manager  So that  That also went horribly wrong  I don't think that picture  Did it  No it did appear  I believe  It's out there somewhere  It didn't help  We know because of history  Nothing helped  Right 
[02:23:00]  We were thrown off the air  And escorted to the Connecticut state line  And told never to return  Right  So then  Now they're like  They're not giving up on  Trying to save our jobs  The mayor's like  Absolutely not  I'm not throwing pies  At two dopey DJs  Now we still have a bad image  And a bunch of pies  So what to do  What to do  They figured  They would let us  And a photographer again  Go down to a  Children's hospital  Children's cancer  Kid hospital  With terminally ill children  And present them 
[02:23:30]  With pies  Because that's going to make  Everyone just happy  Yeah  They're going to love us  They go  You know  Oh and A  They said the mayor was dead  But look at what great guys they are  Giving pies to dying children  Yeah but you end up in a diabetic section  Yeah  And this is  And this is April  And so now we got the forklift of pies  In the lobby of this hospital  And the kids are coming out  From all angles  Like  We didn't even know  Just  Yeah we didn't even know  It was a children's hospital 
[02:24:00]  We were going to the hospital  Drop off some pies  They tell us  To some people  We get down there  And it's like  It's a children's hospital  It's a terminally ill children's hospital  So  They start coming out of the woodwork  And we're like  No  One looking worse than the other  I mean  It's not happening  This part is not funny  I mean this is reality  They were just  Wow  Let me call you  Stremski  Tough kid  Here's a pie  Yeah  Yeah here's a pie  I want to live to see Christmas  Pie  Yeah wonderful  Thank you  Thanks  And they're setting up  They're just setting it up 
[02:24:30]  As a big huge press thing  The photographer's ready  They got the pies all organized  It's a photo op  The kids are gathering around the pies  We're going to present them with the pies  And get a nice shot  Throw it in the hurl  And we'll get to go back on the radio  And talk about  Whipping out Wednesday everybody  Yeah sure  So then we're wondering  Why it's taking so long  To get the photo op together  Because at this point  Ant and I are really  Honestly just confused  About the whole thing  Yeah  We're like  What is really going on here  And they're all like  Well we got to wait for Billy  Yeah Billy  Billy was the one  That was in the worst shape 
[02:25:00]  Billy had like  A round the clock nurse  Hooked up to all sorts of machines  And a wheelchair  And here comes Billy  It was like Captain Christopher Pike  In that episode of Star Trek  When he was just in that machine  Beep  Beep  Beeping once for yes  Twice for no  No I mean  Basically the buzz kill  I mean to be honest  You know  The buzz kill  Like we had a buzz  In a terminal  Children's hospital  In the first place  I mean but the kids  Most of them are  You know  Understanding the situation  They got a good attitude  About them  But then here comes Billy  And you can just see 
[02:25:30]  What little happiness  There was in the room  Just go  And now it's like  Oh my god  What is going on here  We had to go  So then Anthony and I  Are kind of hanging out  With each  You know  Next to each other  And then this is  One of the supervisors  Is like  They're going to sing  A few songs  Before we take the picture  I'm like  Alright cool  Whatever  You know  We're here  And this one girl  Gets up  And never forget it  Kind of looked like  Cindy Lou Who  From The Grinch  No joke  I mean right out  Of the freaking movie  And she starts singing  Silent Night 
[02:26:00]  Was it Silent Night?  Silent Night  And I'm thinking to myself  Wow this is really weird  It's April  And she's singing  A Christmas song  And I'm like  Wow this is really strange  And looking at Anthony  We're like  Christmas song  Kind of looking at each other  Like Christmas song  That's when the supervisor  Kind of leans over  To Anthony and I  Whispers into both of our ears  At the same time  You see  Cindy's not going to  Make it to Christmas  So they were singing  Christmas songs  In spring  So Anthony and I  At this point  We're like  That's it  Done  We get it now 
[02:26:30]  No effing way  And I think it was you  Looked right at the photographer  It's like  If one effing picture  Shows up in a newspaper  We're going to  The idea of exploiting  Dying children  Trying to get our  Dopey jobs back  The way management  Went about the whole thing  Was so sleazy  It came off so sleazy  That we just  We hung out  Gave the kids the pies  The second hand pies  And left  And yeah  Threatened the photographer  That he was not 
[02:27:00]  To snap a picture  And then it was just  At that point  I think we were just  Please just fire us  Let us move on  We did it over with  Because this whole  Trying to save our job  Thing is just getting  Sleazy  And yeah  They gave us the boot  We ended up getting  A much better  More higher paying  And more lucrative job  At WNEW in New York  One other thing  That is of interest  You know  We had the news crews  Following us everywhere  And it was  One of the most surreal moments  I'm at my apartment  In Wellesley 
[02:27:30]  Watching the news  Because now we're  You know  We're dopey DJs  Like wow  Look at us on TV  You know  And literally  It was probably  The first time  We really got  Real TV exposure  So it was kind of cool  Even though you knew  You were in deep trouble  And all of a sudden  I'm watching  The 11 o'clock news  And I'm like  Wow that house  Looks really familiar  And I forgot  To report his name  It was the guy  That used to have  The thick mustache  I think he ended up  Shaving it  And it was a big deal  Up there by the way  And 
[02:28:00]  Slow news day  And the reporter's  Doing this report  From someone's front yard  And I'm like  That house looks really  Oh my god  They're right outside  We're here at the home  Of Greg Opie Hughes  You can see him  Peering out that window  Right there  Yeah  You couldn't tell  By the pies  On the front lawn  Right  But it was so surreal  You're not really thinking  You're like  Oh my god  What  And then I'm looking  Out the window  And there's the guy  Doing his live report  And you know  Slow news day I guess  Yeah and they have footage  You know  The famous footage  Of them knocking on the door  Earlier 
[02:28:30]  And  No comment  And my girlfriend  At the time  Opened the door  In a bathrobe  Like ah  No comments  Closing the door  You know  They have all that  You should have  Thrown a disc  At his head  How do you not  Miss anything  Oh  With you  It's easy  Yeah it really is  Even I  I'm in on the game  I'm lying out of your mouth  And then we got  What you would call it  Outside the studio  That day as well  Near the elevators  Oh yeah  Trying to give our  A couple more  Of the  Trying to give our  Apology  Yeah they asked us  For an apology 
[02:29:00]  We really weren't good  At apologizing back then  We've gotten no better  At it  But back then  It's nothing worse  Than when a news camera  Is in your face  Asking you  Would you like to  Apologize to the mayor  Or anybody really  And you're smirking  And grinning  And laughing  We apologize  It just looks so bad  So insincere  And that's exactly  How it did look  And well you know  The rest  We got the boot  But look how  Things worked out  We learned from  That mistake  Yeah  And lasted three more  Years before we got 
[02:29:30]  Thrown out of another  Station  Before we got  Thrown off the entire  Medium  Were there any other  Things that you came  Up with that you  Either before that  Or since then  Where you said  Okay this is gonna  This is gonna go over  The line  In some way  We could stay  Away from this  We thought a couple  Of things were gonna  Get us the boot  The biggest one  Was the voyeur bus  We had a bus  With plexiglass sides  A real full size bus  And it was gutted  And set up like  A little apartment  With glass sides  And we had nude girls  Driving around in it 
[02:30:00]  And we had a bunch  Teenage  Yeah  Well some of them  Were 18, 19 years old  I mean officially  The bit was called  Teen voyeur bus  Teen voyeur bus  I mean they were  You know they were  Of age though  They were 18, 19  And when Giuliani  Was in office  He was always  I mean what a stick  In the mud he is  About anyone having fun  So we figured  We'd have this bus  With some people in it  From the show  Jim Norton  Lewis Black was on  Rick Delgado  Who is now in trouble  For the Hot 97  Tsunami song  He was on the bus  And you were supposed  To go on the bus  And I was supposed  To go  Thank god I didn't go 
[02:30:30]  Yeah we figured  We'd take the bus  Down to the mayor's office  And have the girls  Shower in the bus  Right in front of  The mayor's office  And then drive back  Up 6th  It worked  We went down there  We announced  The route too  Yeah it was like  A parade route  Or route  Depending on what you like  I say route myself  Route  And people were buying  Disposable cameras  All over Manhattan  And they were on  Every single block  It was like a parade  Because how often  Do you get to see nudity  Just driving down the street 
[02:31:00]  And we had reporters  You know our reporters  On the bus  And it was  CNN crew  It was around Christmas time  This was our Christmas present  To New York City  Yeah that's how we presented it  Here's our present to you  So we figured  We'd get them back up  On 6th Avenue  And have them drive  Back up to the station  And they noticed  6th Avenue was very deserted  Well but going down there  I just want to add  The first sign of trouble  Was when we decided  To let the CNN reporter  On the bus  Yeah  I guess they just happened  To be in the area  Doing a story  And they saw this thing  Roll by 
[02:31:30]  Like what the F  And we're like  Yeah come on the bus  Thinking CNN will do  A nice positive story  On teen girls  Driving down Broadway  We were  Look we were really stupid  Back then  I mean we're still stupid  I know that  But we were stupid  We're like  Hey look CNN's  Going to do a piece on us  CNN this is going to be  So positive for us  We have teen nude girls  Driving down Broadway  New York  Right  This is great  What the hell  Were we thinking  I don't know  And the story was just  The story was so ugly 
[02:32:00]  Another surreal moment  I'm on vacation  Skiing in the middle  Of nowhere  Somewhere up in  I think it might have  Even been Killington  And all of a sudden  I'm watching this CNN report  About some dopes in New York  Not even thinking  It was about me  And first of all  I'm like  Uh oh  This isn't good  This isn't good  Yeah but anyway  Why was the street clear  Well the street was very deserted  Sixth Avenue  When they drove up  And there was a lot of  Police blockades  Yes Opie  Well because I know  You're going to the  The punchline 
[02:32:30]  But really fast  Then the report is on there  And we decide  That it's not good enough  That there's naked teen girls  In this bus  Where all of New York  Including probably  Underage kids  Could check it out  Anybody  We drove it through  Times Square  Right  Not a very populated area  In the city  And this is where  We're just so stupid  We always have to  Like make it even worse  For ourselves  We're like  Hey I got an idea  Whoever came up with it  Why don't we stop the bus  In front of the  In front of the  Town hall  Yeah the mayor's office  The mayor's office  Down you know  Downtown  And let the girls 
[02:33:00]  Take a shower  Yeah  So they showered  Two girls  In a shower  Right  Pushed a pie off them  Right in front of  The mayor's office  Yeah  Like that's gonna be  Okay right  Now we're just  Shoving it in the mayor's face  Like look what we  Could get away with  Salt in the wound  So then we think  What happened was  The CNN reporter  Ran off the bus  Cause she left the bus  Right around that time  Yep  It was Julie Mose  Or whatever her name was  Can't remember  The one that does  The fluff  Jeannie Mose  Jeannie Mose  Jeannie Mose  Jeannie Mose 
[02:33:30]  Okay yeah  She's like does  Those stupid fluff pieces  So I guess what we've heard  Is that she ran in  And showed the mayor  Look what is going on  In your city  Showed the mayor the clip  And was like  How do you feel  That this radio show  Is having nude women  Shower in front of your office  And he went to the bat phone  Man  He went to the bat phone  Police commissioner  Everybody  And at this point  We had NYPD guys  Cause they were all fans  Of the show  Helping us out  They were literally  Escorting the bus  All the way down  To the mayor's office 
[02:34:00]  Doing like crowd control  But wasn't  Wasn't  Yes  We were driving up  6th Avenue  This is where it gets good  The bus is driving up 6th  Very deserted  Police blockade  And it turns out  We were the only vehicle  On the road  It turns out  And I don't know  How they got on  That should have been a sign  You know those  Dopey cartoons  Where all of a sudden  There's a car  And all of a sudden  It just veers off  Hey  Where are the big crowds  Of people that were  Looking at us  Down Broadway  Yeah it turns out  That President Clinton 
[02:34:30]  Who had landed at Kennedy  A little earlier  His motorcade  Was headed up 6th Avenue  And  So they had this  This whole street  Blocked off  Residential motorcade  Bus full of new teen girls  On 6th Avenue  Well  The vehicles that swarmed  Around this bus  It was the black SUVs  All the big New York City brass  Not just the uniform  Cops  Just swarmed  These guys had uniforms  You never want to see 
[02:35:00]  Yeah  I mean we've all seen  The NYPD uniform  Obviously  These guys had things  On their uniform  That you just  Don't want to see ever  It was really bad  All sorts of medals  And  Like they were from  Another country  You know  Got on the bus  Everyone off  Got the zip strip  Handcuffed  Cuffed them all  Brought them down  To a booking  12 to  Something like  12 or 13 people  Were arrested  They ripped apart  Ripped the bus apart  Because one of our guys  Was bragging that he  Hit his pot on the bus  It just was the worst 
[02:35:30]  Yep  And they stayed in jail  For how long  I don't know  Like 36 hours  36 hours  They couldn't even find  Anything to book him on  But  You know  It was one of those things  Where Julianne was so pissed off  That he told the cops  Just keep them in there  As long as possible  And he had to have  A press conference  And he had to say  To everybody  Watching  They're stupid  Yeah  That the mayor  That the mayor  Then got in front of  A podium  With the police commissioner  And was asked  This question  And they said  You know  What do you think  About this 
[02:36:00]  And he just looks  And goes  You say it's stupid  It's just stupid  And it's one of my  Favorite clips  Watching Julianne  And he said  How stupid we are  Yeah  I don't know  That was great  Really fast  Because there was another one  Footage, news, and pics  On foundrymusic.com  Thank you  Oh there you go  Foundrymusic.com  Or opiananthony.com  Hopefully  It will be  It will be linked  To opiananthony.com  For the new listeners  Because it is a lot of fun  To check out  But you can go to  Foundrymusic.com  Right now  To check it out  Anyway  Real fast 
[02:36:30]  Because Ben just reminded me  Of another prank  We did in Boston  The year before  The mayor's prank  We did a pearl jam  Thing  Up in a fictitious town  Called  Oh yeah  No it's  Jaffrey, New Hampshire  Right?  Jaffrey, New Hampshire  Which is a little town  Up there  Over the Massachusetts border  And we said that  Pearl Jam  Was doing a surprise show  At a bar called  Larky's  Yeah  Take a hint  It's called Larky's  Okay  And we told  We kind of gave directions 
[02:37:00]  To where it was  But it was very vague  It was like on the corner  Of a street  Yeah  Near a gas station  Near a gas station  We gave these vague directions  And it was just  You know  A small club  So you gotta get there quick  Because it's gonna fill up  First come first serve  And of course  You know  Pearl Jam back then  Just the hugest band  And people are like  Well Larky's  I've never heard of Larky's  Well it's a bunch of clubs  And the club on the ground floor  Is called Darky's  Remember  It was a sports club  Right right  Darky's  And then Larky's  Was on top of that  Barky's 
[02:37:30]  Yeah whatever  And then  I guess  I wasn't up there  You know  Officially  But all indications are  That a couple thousand people  Showed up for this  Surprise Pearl Jam concert  In the middle of nowhere  And they all were just  Kind of driving around  In their cars  Trying to figure out  Where the place was  And the cops are calling  Begging us to stop  Because it's a major problem  Up there  And of course  Once again  We're idiots  We're like  No we ain't stopping  This is just fun  That's what our problem  Has been for years  We never knew  When to stop  Like we would just  Do these pranks  Or something  And think it was 
[02:38:00]  The best thing ever  And the boss would say  Stop it  Or the cops would say  Stop it  For some reason  We would just  No  Yeah  We're not stopping  Yeah  So then  Then after our show  We started doing breaks  For the other radio show  After us  That make them believe  We were in the middle  Of the concert  You know  Doing reports  To the radio station  Yeah we went into  One of the other studios  Started blasting  Some live Pearl Jam  Behind us  We didn't even have  Live Pearl Jam  Really  Was it Studio Pearl Jam  It was Studio Pearl Jam  But we thought  Alright we'll just 
[02:38:30]  Play it loud enough  No we had sound effects  Of like a crowd  Yeah  You know screaming  And applauding  Or whatever  And we threw that  Figuring that would work  And they bought it man  Big time  So then we felt  The next year  We had to outdo ourselves  Because that's what  Unfortunately  The life we lived  For many years  We had to always  Outdo ourselves  So alright  We did the Pearl Jam  Thing last year  What are we going to do  This year to top that  Well that was the beginning  Of the outdoing phase  Of the OPN RP  We would always  Have to outdo ourselves  And people still speculate 
[02:39:00]  If we hadn't gotten  Fired for the sex  At St. Pat's  Debacle  That we would have  Had to sacrifice  The baby live  In our studio  Yeah  Well you can do that  On satellite right  Well yeah  XM allows us  As a matter of fact  We have that scheduled  For next week  Baby sacrifice  Stay tuned  Yeah I think that's on  Monday's show  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  So  Alright well  Thanks a lot guys  I hope you got enough  For your little story there  I did  You should  Email Ben

[02:50:00]  It might be dated  I don't know  This hasn't been played in years  Oh, it hasn't been played in years  But if Mikey Biggs heard it  Yeah  Perhaps we shouldn't play it  You know, guys  I heard that five years ago  Yeah  I don't  This was supposed to be off our band CD, Cringe  Yeah  Which I'm glad it was banned, by the way, now  Because, you know  There was 66 tracks  66 tracks  It was going to be our follow-up CD to Dementor World  And it was never released  Because the lawyers had a real problem  With just about everything that was on this thing  Yeah 
[02:50:30]  And now that I listen to it  Yeah, there's still some good stuff on it  But in general  Yeah, all right  A lot of it's dated now  But Montana crotch rat  Because Charles Corral  Would do the whole  We leave you this Sunday morning  We leave you this Sunday morning  He would go out on the road  And do stories from, you know  Your town, USA  And he had some chicken, Montana  That he had a fishing  Fishing  Cabin up there or something  God, you remember the story 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, he used to  He used to go up there  And that was like his whole thing  I guess to get away from his wife  Honey, I'm going to the fishing cabin  I'm going to hang out  And listen to the sounds of trout  You know  And he would go fishing  And he was fishing for a little more  Because he was also hunting  For a beaver  Ha ha  I mean, ha ha ha  I think this is a good example  Of you and me being sophomoric  Yes, this is some sophomoric  Actually, I think this is all you  Is it?  Yeah, I believe this is all Anthony  Was Brian Unger involved in this? 
[02:51:30]  Well, Brian Unger  That's a different bit  Yeah, Brian Unger started this bit  Yeah  Because he came in  He used to work on Comedy Central  Yep  He's a really funny guy  Very funny  He like was the first guy  I ever saw do that whole  Very dry reporter  Like they do on the Daily Show  Like all the reporters do  On the Daily Show  He was the guy  I think he started it  Yeah  And then they threw him out  But he did that to a T  Remember when we were talking  About a tsunami  Right  And the way he used to say it  Is like the anchors say it on the news

[02:53:00]  And me making my face look like a glazed donut  Before I get back to my wife  The sounds of the elusive bearded clan  And me trying to shuck the hell  Out of that bearded clan  I usually don't say things like that  But I'll leave you this Sunday morning  With the sounds of me 
[02:53:30]  Giving her the old pile driver  That's the one where I crouch over her  Push down real hard  In a pile driving motion  So now  Pictures and sounds of me  And the pile driver  On my mistress in Montana  On the road  The road I prefer  Pictures now of the Hershey Highway  I visited that in Montana

[02:54:30]  The sounds of me and my mistress  And me shooting a tray up in that piece  And now finally  The sounds of my mistress  Hobbing my knob  We don't often leave you with the sounds of knob hobbing  I figure this is a good time to leave  And now the sounds of me  And my knob being hobbed 
[02:55:00]  Charles Kuralt on the road  Hob  Knob  Now the sounds of  A purple helmet warrior  Going into battle again  Against the dreaded bearded clan  Montana crotch rat  Here's the Montana crotch rat  God I wish she shaved 
[02:55:30]  A little personal hygiene in the groin area  So it wouldn't look so much like a possum  Woman looks like roadkill  Looks like the last time I saw  Woodchuck caught in a combine  Red and brown and whatnot  Now the sounds of a woodchuck  Being caught in a combine  Leave you  I mentioned she  Looks like she had 
[02:56:00]  Einstein's head in a leg lock  She trimmed that  First time I made love to her  Pulled those panties down  And looked like  Fidel Castro eating a London broil  Used to have a lot of sex in my car  Yes  Gave her a Spanish fly once  I found her on the gear shift  Now the sounds of my girlfriend  On the gear shift  We leave you  Yes 
[02:56:30]  I just wish she was a little better  With the hygiene  Sort of looked like when you take two big pieces of silly putty  Slap them together and throw them in the floor of a barbershop  All pink and hairy  That's still really funny  Wow  Did we just go on and on with those things?  That's what we used to do in the old days 
[02:57:00]  We ran everything into the ground  You remember that?  Totally  Oh my god  The producer of Sunday Morning is in studio  It's now with Charles Osgood obviously  But he can't deny it  He's laughing his ass off in the corner  And I think they taped this  And they're going to bring that back to CBS  Oh Jesus no  We'll give you a clean coffee  You guys can share it at the Christmas party  The old Charles Kuralt one  Yeah  There you go  He did have a mistress up there  Is what they were saying  Right  Actually did he father a child from her I think  And they found out 
[02:57:30]  No he never did?  Yeah there was something that came out afterwards  After I guess he died  That he had a pretty big relationship  It wasn't just a fling  He was like just about married to this woman  Yeah  Oh man that is hilarious  Absolutely  Another trip down memory lane  Well Mikey I hope you like that one  Do you have that bit  I'll tell you one of the funniest ones you ever did  Was the Brady Bunch on the stairs or something  Oh yeah  Oh god was that funny  Well we could talk about  We got some Brady news today

[02:58:30]  At least they did something  Yeah  It sucks  Only one  A game that means nothing right  You get a  Oh it sucks because it screws up your vacation  Yeah  The guy's off and now you know  He's got a cast on his arm  What happened?  Just got bent backwards  Finally dislocated it  Tore out some ligaments  So  Got four pins in it  I've got a scar about eight inches long  From the inside of my palm down my wrist  Oh wow  And how did it happen?  I was actually doing a kickoff return that time  And just got caught up  And you know 
[02:59:00]  Two fat kids running 50 yards at each other  There's quite an impact if you can imagine  Yeah  Dude he's a monster  How much do you weigh bro?  I'm only like 290, 295 right now  Because I haven't been working out since I did this  Right  You're usually a little over 300 when you're playing  And he's like 6'5 I think  Yeah 6'5  And he was a fan of our show when he was at college  Yeah  And we're down in Dallas  You know I went on tour with Norton a little bit  Because I was bored out of my mind  And Norton's doing his thing  And all of a sudden these two massive guys  Come up to Norton and I at the end of the show 
[02:59:30]  To say hey we're big fans  And it turns out you know they play for the Cowboys  And we're like holy F  This is pretty cool man  Very cool  Been friends ever since  So what do you think about the Super Bowl?  Pats are favored by 7  I gotta take the Pats man  They just look unstoppable  They're a hell of a team  And they've got some great chemistry  And I've played the Eagles  And no disrespect to them  They're a good team in their own right  But I mean their defense coordinator  Is really good  But the Pats  You know they're just on a roll  And it's hard to get  Teams like that stopped  Certainly are  I hate it that it's  In the same year that the Sox did it 
[03:00:00]  Yeah  Because now they're just like  They're up there  Look at us  We're the best  We got the champs  Baseball  Football  Go Pats  Go Sox  And everyone's walking around  With the B hat on  Yeah  Doesn't matter  I've never seen so many  Boston Red Sox hats  Walking around on people  All these bandwagon jumpers  Right here in New York City  Everyone's wearing the  The B hat  It's an insult in New York  Who are you kidding  Stop it  Yeah  You wear a Yankee cap up there  And they'll mug you 
[03:00:30]  That's why I keep mine in Jersey  My B hat  I don't know  I could bring it into New York  You would wear that  Stop it  What I like about the Pats  It's very interesting  It's such a team concept  I mean  Even though Brady's a rock star  Everyone knows it  But as far as the press and everything  They're all crediting everybody else  Known as a standout player in the media  It's a whole team  That's when you get into trouble  I think so  Especially in football  Because I think guys like Tyson Walters  He's in the trenches  Tyson Walters isn't doing freaking commercials 
[03:01:00]  During the Super Bowl  No one's really interviewing him after the game  Gee rub it in Opie  No right  No one even cares about this guy  As long as my direct deposit works  I don't give a damn  There you go  But what I'm saying is  Then you get these guys  You know like Randy Moss and stuff  Getting all the attention and stuff  And you know  And having all the camera crews  Following him around  I'm thinking if you're a player  It kind of gets to you after a while  Right  He's like a drummer  He's like being a drummer  And you don't feel like  You know  You don't feel like  You don't want to be a team player with the guy 
[03:01:30]  Right  And it kind of ruins up the whole team dynamic  I think it does  It depends on the guy  I mean if the guy's a total prick off the field  Then you know  Then you get irritated with  If the guy's cool off the field  You don't mind seeing it  You're actually encouraging him  If you have a good quarterback  Then you want to see him do well  Or running back  Whatever  But if the guy's a total a-hole  You might want him to look like an ass  And maybe let a few guys slip through  Oops  Oops  Can't believe I tripped  This guy's coming in to break your neck  You've got to hear the stories he tells  They're great  There's payback on the field 
[03:02:00]  Of course  There's a lot of payback  If you think someone is  Purposely trying to hurt one of your players  It's overjotting  Oh they set you up bad on the field  Wow  Oh yeah  Nasty  It gets ugly  Oh yeah  Especially if  The older guys that have been around a while  They get a certain rapport with the crews  And things like that  And you know  Yeah  They'll let things slide every once in a while  So  Because they know it's payback  It's part of the game  I mean  So much is taken out of the game  You know  With the way they're 
[03:02:30]  Enforcing rules  And changing them all the time  So  The NFL is way too strict  I love the showboding personally  I kind of like the strictness  I think it makes it  I think it keeps it  Oh really?  Very uniform game  There's no gray areas  You know  Here's the rules  You stick to it  I like when some of the players  Make fools out of themselves  After the touchdowns  And after sacks  Yeah without a doubt  And plus they taunt the other one  And that pisses the other team off  So it makes it more  You know  They want to hurt you  You know what I think  I see a lot more of these days  Is when someone gets tackled 
[03:03:00]  They're knocked down  They're at the bottom of the pile  Or something  Before everyone gets up  Like the last guy  They put their helmets together  And you know he's just  Going yeah yeah  You ain't getting up  You didn't go nowhere  Like there's a lot of smack talk  While they're on the ground  So that by the time they get up  They're heated up  And want to kill each other  There's a little bit  And there's you know  Ankle twisting  There's some punches  Really?  There are punches thrown  There are guys that will try to  You know  Get their hands inside masks  And go for the eyes  Yeah  They're  My favorite story  Gladiators  The craziest story  I'm starting 
[03:03:30]  And it's Thanksgiving Day  My rookie year  So this was three years ago  Or whatever  And  We're playing the Redskins  And they have a guy  Defensive tackle  Named Gardner  This guy's like  6'8  3'30  Ripped  Crazy  Just crazy guy  My friend's playing  Left guard at the time  Because Larry Allen was hurt  And he had been in Washington  Prior to coming to Dallas  So he knew Gardner  And they had a little bit of a thing  Going back and forth  And my boy  Right at the beginning of the game  Tries to cut block  Which he  Dives at his legs 
[03:04:00]  Try to take him out  You know  Get rid of the guy  Because when he wants to go  You cannot stop the guy  Don't care  You know  You can't stop him  Because he's just  Crazy  So my boy cuts him  He gets up  Starts going  And this is all in quotes  But I know I can say it in an accent  He's like  You motherfucker  God damn it Ross  He's like  Jesus knows what you've done  And he will pay you back  For this motherfucker  You've got this  6'8  330 pound guy  Yo motherfucker  And just  Jesus will repay you for this  And we're just  We're standing there  And I'm a rookie  And my friend's in his second year 
[03:04:30]  And we're just like  Oh god  We're like  We're gonna fucking die  Oh here's your new job  Dealing with these people  I mean  And this is the scariest guy  You've ever  I mean just  Damn  Huge  That's great  Does that shit like  Say like after a game  Would that carry over  Into a bar  Do you think  It depends on the guys  I mean  There are a lot of guys  In the league  You know  Everyone realizes that  You know  It is a business in the end  And you know  And you have a lot of friends  On other teams  Because you play with them 
[03:05:00]  In college  Or wherever you met them  Hanging out  But then there are guys  Like you know  That guy  And you know  That have a little bit  Of an edge to him  Shall we say  And they might carry it over  It's like anywhere else  You know  Even in an office setting  You got the one guy  Who's the prick  You know  Doesn't get along  With anyone  Goes off at the drop  Of a hat  Same thing in football  Only these guys  Are monsters  That can rip your head off  Yeah  That's the problem  Unbelievable  Yeah  What about the stories  About the guys  Not showering  And making sure  They have real bad breath  Just to throw off  Their opponent 
[03:05:30]  I know guys  That don't shower  And don't do  That kind of stuff  I don't think  You really know  Because once you're  In the game  You know  That's not a big deal  But you know  They'll do anything  They'll motherfuck you  Or they'll  You know  Hell some guys  Wink at you  And you know  Call you baby  And stuff like that  Because you got  So many guys  That are just homophobes  And if you say  Anything like that  They'll just  They start  Flipping out  Wow that is  A funny gag  Hey sweetie  After the game  Me and you  In the shower  Give you a little  Spooning  You want to pick 
[03:06:00]  That soap up  For me big guy  That would suck  I'd get a heart  On playing ball  It would throw me off  So I went down  To Dallas  You know  With Norton  Stuff  And then  While Norton  Is just obsessing  About something stupid  You know  I hang out  With Tyson  We go play golf  At the Dallas Cowboys  Golf course  It is amazing  Oh really  Everything is done  At Dallas Cowboys  You know  Decor and colors  They got the  Rejects from the  Dallas Cowboys  Cheerleaders  That you know  Serve the hot dogs  At the halfway house  They are  They couldn't make the cut 
[03:06:30]  Oh they're so hot still  But I guess  They didn't have  They're still nine and a half  Yeah they're still nine and a half  But they weren't quite tens  Or their dance moves  Were a little off  Selling hot dogs  After the ninth  Yeah so Jerry Jones  Throws them on the golf course  To be the beer girls  And the hot dog girls  After nine  Are they dressed like cheerleaders  I'm trying to remember  No they're not dressed like cheerleaders  That would kind of be cool  Maybe distracting  They're wearing some skimpy shorts  Yeah  Mr. Jones knows how to do it up right  But the golf carts  Are all in Dallas Cowboys stuff  And everything has a logo on it  In the pro shop  And Jerry Jones just built this 
[03:07:00]  For just the players  And the staff  Yeah that's how it started off  And then now he's  You know it's branched out  And he's making more of a resort  And they've built some big hotels  They're tied to  You guys see him  Was he had to drive like 350  Dude no joke  He was driving par fours  No problem  Really  It's insane  I can't even explain  Watching his golf ball  Go through the air  It's like  It's  It just pierces  It's  Yeah but when you have six putts  It doesn't make it happen  Yeah I know  Oh I know  Because then on the green  It's like  You know  He's actually a really good golfer  But the problem is 
[03:07:30]  He doesn't know his own  Yeah exactly  He doesn't know his own strength  50 yards with his putter  Yeah yeah  So you know  He's 10 feet from the cup  And all of a sudden  You know  It goes by 20 feet  He has like no touch  On the greens  It's hilarious  Yeah exactly  Happy Gilmore  Yeah  Chases it like it was a fumble  Trying to get it  But the ball  When it leaves his club  Oh my god  Hey with those girls  Driving around  How many times  Do you hear the joke  Oh she was hit  Between the first and second hole  That old gag  Alright now we have to 
[03:08:00]  Take a quick break  Patrice is  Oh he was pacing  Yeah where is Patrice  He's getting angry  He's getting angry  But he looks all pissed off  We're in a good mood here today  We could wrestle next segment  Huh  Oh post search  Patrice  That's not good  He brought luggage with him  I thought he was throwing it around  To see its durability quality  No  He's not even smiling  Of course he isn't  He's going to kill me  He's going to yell at me for this  Did Poe search you  Tyson  No he wanted to fight me  I think 
[03:08:30]  Oh he wants to fight everybody  I just knocked on the door  And I heard his voice  From the radio  So he opens it up  And he's like  Hello  And I'm like  Hi  Is it over here  He's like  Who are you  I'm like  I'm his friend from Dallas Tice  And I play for the Cowboys  He just looks me up and down  Like two times  And then he's just like  Scowls  And like  Come in  Yeah  Alright  I'm angry  I didn't get  You know  Full cavity surgery  I was a little disappointed  I think we got a problem here  Because you didn't get searched  Because you're white  And 6'5  Patrice is about the same height as you  And pretty much the same size 
[03:09:00]  More or less  And he got searched  Patrice is huge  He got searched like a mother  He did  You think it has to do with  Patrice's race  We'll find out next  Are we discriminating here  With the security  I don't know what's going on  We'll talk to Patrice next about it  But we got Tyson from the Cowboys  So we'll play this little thing  And continue  It's coming  To the Gay Channel  What is up  It's the second annual  Male group orgy competition  And he hits the hole  Right after Jesse opens it up  With your host  John Madden  And Pat Summerall 
[03:09:30]  And then everyone's  Kind of slopping around  Down there  And grunting  And groaning  And you know  You get mud and stuff  Flying  And gang tackles  And scrums  And quagmires  No fems  Fats or hairies  Just the hunkiest  Gay studs  And wild  Group action competition  I'd like to pack that guy around too  Don't get carried away John  There was all kinds of stuff  Flying around there  It's male group sex  To die for  As described by the best  Play-by-play team  In the biz  That was the late one 
[03:10:00]  That one didn't come  And didn't come  And didn't come  And finally  They threw it out of there  I don't know where  That one came from  Look at that big old  Meat and lob  What a meal  Those guys are having  That look good  That's a good group  If you go nuts  For tight butts  You push  You push  You push  Get Gaperview today  You just rode him backward  You just put him  Right on his back  With Pat Summerall  And John Madden  That looked like  It was the last shot  Out of the Roman candle  The second annual  Male group orgy competition  On Gaperview

Hey, why don't you tell a story?  What, I wait two years  And tell a story that happened yesterday?  Hey, Opie  Here's what happened to me  Pretend we're on radio  You know  Why'd you  He likes causing trouble  That's what he did  This whole system changed now  They're like, we're back now 
[03:14:30]  This is what we're gonna do  I mean, satellite radio  There's not much processing  So just back off the mic a little bit  You're killing people at home  I mean, you're hilarious  But just back off  Don't eat the mic  Only when you're yelling  Just change  You talk up here  When you're yelling back there  I apologize  It was very funny  I can see Opie came out  Opie came out  Tried to give me a  Hello, how you doing  But it really, you can feel it  I'm not goofy  And I'm not needy either  Don't like me no more, fellas  I did the enemy show  When they were gone  Hold on, hold on 
[03:15:00]  Hold on  Now, everyone knows that  The finger snap  Everyone  What is with Master Poe, Opie?  Wait, hold on  I wanna address what you're saying  Cause it is the truth  We've never played that game  We understand you guys  Gotta go on other radio shows  Oh, you're supposed to stay off  Of any other radio show  For two years  Don't you  Don't you go near here  Just cause Voss was stupid enough  Not to do any other shows  Doesn't mean you had to  That's what I'm saying  We never played that game before  We understand  It was a  It's a  I'm loyal to Opie and Anthony 
[03:15:30]  But you weren't around  Right  Exactly  So  So if you had to say  Hey, come on in  Talk about the whole thing  You know  Hey, yeah, come on in  But there's no way  We had  So  So  Somebody  Said, come on down  I said  You can say Howard  Can you say Howard?  Yeah, of course  So Stern's like come down  And tell the story  It was fresh in my mind  I was feeling  Wait, what story did it tell?  The whole Brazil story  Oh, okay, okay  When it was fresh  But I wasn't talking about just  You know, dildos and hookers, man  It changed my life in a sort of way  So I had to get it out  Well, we all knew that 
[03:16:00]  You know, we knew that a long time ago  But we didn't have a show  Right  You went down to Brazil one time  Just to hang out and have fun  Like I heard about this place  From other people  At the Comedy Cellar  And next thing you know  You go down every three months now  Or something crazy like that  I can't stop going down  He adopted abroad from down there  First of all  Pussy whipped  Okay  This is one of  I just came down for abuse  No, no, no  Not at all  Yeah, Rich doesn't want to mess with you  I don't fucking  Alright, so  Let's start with this  What happened with Master Poe? 
[03:16:30]  He didn't search my buddy  Tyson Walters from the Cowboys  First of all, Opie  Oh, Master Poe's in the studio  You know what I'm doing with Master Poe  I know, but  Why is he being coy with me?  Because I like rubbing it in  What happened?  What happened?  Why don't you treat me like  Crazy Patty or something?  You know what he does  My asshole is as big as a cookie  The Christmas cookie canister  Look at it, man  He goes like this  He goes  Hey, Patrice, how are you, man?  Good to see you  Come in here  What?  Pull down your pants  So why he's forcing himself on you 
[03:17:00]  He's asking you for things  Hey, while I'm grunting  He's like, hey, can I get a picture later, dude?  Great  I'm grunting again  Hey, there's hot chocolate over here  And you can tell he's a sociopath  He's got problems  We all know that  So I don't want to bring the spirit of the show down  I can see how Opie looks at me  Without the corner of his eye now  He's looking at me with his peripheral vision  I love y'all  I called him yesterday  Hey, Opie, man  Blah, blah, blah  I know I did the thing  But, you know  Hey, no return call  I'm Hollywood, too, Opie 
[03:17:30]  I called Ben and said  Just call Patrice back for me  Yeah, just let him on  Keep him out there waiting  I'm looking out there  Like a homeless child  Waiting to get in with a bag of dildos  Like I'm a jackass  And you see how much fun we're having in here, too  Like a dick  He's watching us laugh  And have fun through the window  Oh, let him in  And Ben's coming over  Hey, he'll go out  We'll get you right in  Snap, come on in  It's a whole new ball game with us, bro  Oh, man, y'all changed  Holy moly 
[03:18:00]  Hey, we got networked freaking TV here today  That's why you're changing  You're just changing  Look, Anthony didn't even speak to me  He didn't say hi once  Patrice, hello and welcome back  He came out and got a phony one  Well, look  How are you?  Welcome back with you guys  And I hear on the streets  Hey, yeah, we want Patrice in  Nothing  Not a hi  I didn't know you was back  So, he fell in love  Norton don't talk to me no more  No  You put the silent word out  I'm not silly  Master  So, what did you do to him?  You know what people do 
[03:18:30]  There he is  Master Pose  We all have theme music, too  Patrice  Why does he do this?  He's head of security  He is like  He is like the sensei  At Cobra Kai  It's not only security  It's  It's  It's a  Almost an insulting  It's almost painful  Yeah  Painful  I'm saying  You've got to give him a list  Yeah  And all the paperwork  You had to fill out  Paperwork?  Fingerprints 
[03:19:00]  Then he comes out seven times  For more information  Phone number  And I'm sitting there  Going  I know he's dangerous  So, I'm going  Mr. Poe  Why are you asking me for this?  Oh, that's just in case  Opie asked me to call  And you can't go take a hike  Because it's something  I know he's big under all of that garb  What the hell happened?  He just has these skills  He's like a knife fighter  He knows how to do all these things  I can tell  He's a Puerto Rican with a mullet  That can't be  That has to be dangerous 
[03:19:30]  I can tell you this much  Spanish mullets?  I can tell you this much  We really don't know why he's here  XM hired him  He works for XM?  So, we're wondering  What kind of threats  Did XM get  That they had to hire  Like a trained assassin  And put him in a lock up  Dude, he's our secretary  And he has a thousand  Y'all stare  Technically, he's our secretary  Where you know he's dangerous  Like, you look at him  And go  Oh, my God  This guy is dangerous 
[03:20:00]  Yeah  And he's just  And it takes long  But you're scared to do this  They hired him to train guys  At where?  Quantico?  Yes  To train guys to kill  With their hands  What's Quantico?  Virginia  The Marine Corps  I can't hear myself  They brought him in  To train them to kill people  To train Marines  Marines  Who already pretty much  Got a good hold on  How to kill people  They had to bring him in  To make him kill  Better, more  Or faster  And yeah 
[03:20:30]  Now he's in  In control of our listeners  Coming by with like  Gifts  He's training killers  He can take stalker Patty out  If she hacks up  I couldn't believe it  I'm sitting there  Trying to behave myself  I could not believe  What was going on  I thought it was because  You hated me  But it's  Absolutely not  He thought it was like  Canning camera stuff  It's the real deal  He took a picture of my ID  This was  And then I see the Quantico thing  I don't know what Quantico was  But the Quantico  He's very proud of that  He's got that hanging up  He's got that hanging up 
[03:21:00]  In his little area  Of course  You just can look at him  And tell his name  You just can look at him  Tyson  Did you get Friston?  No, nothing  See  See, nothing happened to Tyson  Why, Mr. Poe?  Okay, well  First of all  What's the difference  Between these two guys  That I could think of?  There's no difference  Both big guys  But he said  Hello, Patrice  My good friend  From years ago  Then he proceeded  To pummel me  You know  Tyson and you  Are about the same size  Big guys  I don't know  What the difference is  I don't think  I think almost  The bigger  I think the bigger  The better 
[03:21:30]  For people  Like he sizes you up  And I think he wants  You to be bigger  And in shape  So it makes him feel better  When he hurts you  Feel a little better  How many bones  Have you pushed up  Into somebody's brain  When you're like that  No, no  I'm not about violence  I'm really not here  To hurt you  I have to do a job  And I just wanted  To make sure  I just wanted  To make sure  That I got all  The information  From you  Which I did  But damn it  You had no problem  When the superior race  Guy walked right through  Well let's  No, no, no

[03:26:00]  I'm here talking  I'm throwing out  Probably some of the funniest stuff  Of my career  And the mic is off  Dude I did not touch that mic  It's gonna take two years  For him to get out the  I'll show you guys stage  He's at that stage  I'll show you guys  Watch this  I've been humbled  Trust me I've been humbled  It's gonna take some time  To get back where I was  Oh my god  But loss isn't for a heartbreak  Oh I can't wait  It's like any relationship  You take that chance  You know we're having a good time  You know  Like Barry Williams  Listen  Huh  No we're gonna get into 
[03:26:30]  A couple things  But go ahead  I mean you know  You went out and bought  A swing for sex  Oh it's great  Do you really  Who  Norton I think brought that up  You have a sex swing  What happened to you  You went down to Brazil  And you lost your mind  Calm down he's choking  Uh oh  Man I was two  It's  Wow  See I told you  I'd come back  Can I explain something  About that sex swing  And all these things  Is that a tear  Yeah  Jeez  I realized something  Can I just say 
[03:27:00]  I realized something  About myself  And about sexuality  Yes  I delve deep deep  Into sexual deviance  Deeper and deeper  Right  I stop  And you know  What it was causing  This serious moment  Condoms  Because it's very hard  To keep it up  With the condoms on  For me  And I realized  That I had to get  I had to go deeper  And deeper  Into this visual  Dirt baggishness  To keep it up  Oh with a condom  With a condom on  So I went raw  For the first time 
[03:27:30]  In a long time  Like a month ago  And I  And I had regular sex  For the first time  In a long time  So I've stopped  Some of this stuff  Some of it  You're back to appreciating  Normal  I'm back to normal  Sex  But  The girls  That I have  Brought down with me  And still around  No longer  Want to do regular sex  So now I'm stuck  In this world of  Did you corrupt them  Or something  I corrupted them  You did  They come over  They set the swing  Up themselves  Sit in it 
[03:28:00]  When you're swinging  Like it's kind of like  You feel like you're  Having sex in a tree  Or something  Like you swing  Like a monkey  I didn't say it like that  Stop it Voss  That was really  That is brutal  I'm telling you  You know what it is  He gives all his  Funniness that he  Would have had  To her  He would have  Like a life tap  Just grabbing any  Bit of Voss  That has any shine to it  Headlines and then he brings her on  After him  But it all started with Brazil 
[03:28:30]  You went down there one time  And you just lost your mind  Norton's been telling all the Patrice stories  For the last four months  I don't understand  What it is  Is  There's a bunch of us  That go down  I know  He talks about how you guys  All sit around with heart-ons  Because you're all on Viagra  Waiting to go upstairs  I could have a heart attack  On Viagra  Norton is sitting there  Sweating like a dirty  Little stress doll  With his robe  And it's really  And he's packing like a monster wood  For like a wormy kid  So it's a strange thing  We've all seen it 
[03:29:00]  I saw it once  I was like  Jesus  It is kind of  Opie  Are you still  You in a relationship?  Thanks for bringing it up  No it's over  I've been trying to get him to come man  Change your lives man  It's not  It's not what you think  It's not just hookers  Yeah but honestly  We have discussed this  Hopefully on the show  I don't get the hooker thing  And I'm not just  I'm not playing a game  I've never got into  I've never got into the hookers  And I never really got into  The lap dancing  Because with me  I need to feel like  The girl actually wants me  Yeah 
[03:29:30]  Yeah  That's the thing  And when I just know  They're doing it for money  Or for whatever reason  I'm so out of the game  Are they still hot to look at  And all that?  Of course  As a human being  Visually I'm like  Wow that's hot  But as far as doing anything  I'm like  No man  I need someone to kind of want me  That's the  At the time  When I was explaining it  Y'all weren't here  For me to explain it to you  I would explain it to you first  It's not about the hookers  Out there  They will make you feel like that  You are buying that  You are buying that  When you go to the show 
[03:30:00]  You're going to buy into that  No way  I'm telling you  Norton almost had a girlfriend  From it  Remember that  He fell in love  Norton got dumped  By a prostitute  He got dumped  By a prostitute  Norton was dumped  By a prostitute  Oh man  Wow  He gets his feelings hurt  Out there  Yeah but here's the thing  You'll meet somebody  Like me  Just reading notes  No we got Don Imus  Calling us today  For some reason  Actually we called  Wow okay  We just looked up at the TV  And we saw Imus  In a really bad pink shirt  So I told Ben 
[03:30:30]  Hey why don't you call  Our friend Imus  So now he's going to  Call the show  That'd be cool  Alright go ahead  So you went down to Brazil  Yeah  You should go  Did you think it was  It was going to be  A one time thing  But now you're kind of  Hooked on the whole  Brazil thing right  Yeah  And so was in Norton  And so was in Norton  And so was in others  Well we know  Dude  Forget about it  We know  I don't know  I would have to say  Close to a dozen people  That I've seen  In comedy clubs  And here and there  That now go  Like you guys are dragging  New people in all the time 
[03:31:00]  It's the best  It's the best  See look at  First of all  Let's get it straight  It's dangerous  Out there  It's really dangerous  Sure  In terms of you know  Violence and in terms of  Whatever  There's a whole bunch  Of homeless master poes  Walking around Brazil  For no reason at all  Asking you for money  And the girls  Are just as dangerous  But  They make you feel  A certain  You should go  Just  You know what it is  It's just to make you  Understand  What a winner you are  Here  You don't put up  With any bullshit  When you come  Back here 
[03:31:30]  Because you go  Wait a minute  I really am a winner  When you go out  You feel  They make you feel like that  Because you buy  Because if you can't  Find a free hair  Not the cooch  No one needs to buy  It's all kind of  Dirt bags  Walking around  He points out the window  Yeah  A bunch of losers  There's a lot of losers  I've seen myself naked  Look at her  God damn g-string  Is up over by her neck  She's a mess  Who are those girls?  There's a lot of girls  Who sleep with me for free  And I look at myself 
[03:32:00]  Naked  And I go  Why  And then that makes me  Not like them more  Because I go  Why would you sleep with me  I would never  Give me a while  So it always  It's already a problem  Yeah  But you go out there  Man  And those girls  Because the fact that  It takes the pressure off  The sex  The pressure of the  The hunt  The pressure of whatever  That's why guys  Get girlfriends here  Because they don't want to  Deal with  All of the nonsense  Of getting a girl  You go there  And you know  You can have  This gorgeous girl  So you really  Interact very well 
[03:32:30]  With them man  It's a  It's a sincere thing  I learned how to speak  Portuguese  It's fantastic  Get out of here  I barely speak English  I'm learning how to speak  Portuguese  How many times a year  You go down now  Twice  Oh that's it  I thought it was more  I've heard twice  Twice a lot  They teach kids  To be prostitutes  Almost that late  Oh Jesus  Stop it  I'm a good guy now  Voss  I'm trying to  Why are you guys  Letting him do this  Have I missed out  This much  What happened  We've been off 
[03:33:00]  For a while  It's kind of hard  To get back  Into the swing  Why are you allowing  Him to do this  Because he got  This little phony  Relationship  That's coming  To a complete halt  I'm going to be there  To catch you  When you're curled up  So what about  The AIDS in Brazil  You worried about  The AIDS and all that  Yeah I'm worried  About the AIDS  On 125th Street  Worried about the AIDS  In the studio  Absolutely  Some of the people  You brought that  Did you bring them  Down here for any  Specific reason  I guess they heard  I don't know  I just came down 
[03:33:30]  To show the guy  Because I know  Norton talks about it  But I'm getting tired  Of hearing that  I'm the only dirt bag  In the whole crowd  No you know  What it is with Jimmy  Now here it is with Jimmy  He likes to commiserate  With other people  It's like any other addict  You know they like  Seeing other people  Doing the heroin  Drinking  You know  And with him  He's such a degenerate  He's such a sexual  Just a complete dirt bag  That he loves seeing  Anyone else  Even kind of getting  Tied up in the whole thing  So he looks at you  You go down there  You find something  You really enjoy  You bring some toys 
[03:34:00]  With you  All of a sudden  Oh that Patrice  He's sick  He's a disturbed  Sick individual  Yeah drop another  Log on my face honey  Yeah oh Patrice  He's out of his mind  But isn't Norton gay  If you mess with a  Transsexual  Right  Aren't you gay  Not really  I would think  If you're with a tranny  There's gotta be some kind  There's something  Going on there  You're gay right  It's still a guy  It's a man  If you don't  First of all  If you don't make out  Okay  Right there  You're not gay  Look at these rules  He has 
[03:34:30]  Or rules  Well Norton says  If you don't push back  You're not gay  Push back  Norton's a sissy  A sissy  So  Norton's a sissy  Norton's a sissy  It's not fair  He's not here  To defend himself  I don't know  He was blowing  Maybe a transverse  So he blew him  And he didn't know  It was an accident  You know  Because some of them  Looked good  And you know  He said  He put his hand  On her back  And as he's rubbing  Her back  He noticed  It was a very  Wide strong back  But he let him finish 
[03:35:00]  Come on  And then said  He had to wash off  Man breath  Now let me ask you  Is it worse for your career  To say you're gay  Or say somebody  Takes a dump  On your chest  That's a good point  We're still figuring that out  Taking a dump  On your chest  Doesn't destroy your career  Being gay is  I think if you had  To choose between the two  You still have to go  With the dump  On the chest  I think it's all  Geographic  Why you think  Gay ruins your career  I think it depends  On where you're from  Gay helps you  Gay helps your career  Unless you're  Ellen DeGeneres  You're in Hollywood  Depends on where you are  Yeah  How many breaks  We have left  One more  And that's it  Alright  We'll just try 
[03:35:30]  To keep  We'll just keep going  Well you brought  The sex toys in  Are these girls gonna  Well if they don't do nothing  We can  Look at  I'm just curious  To see these things  Because  I've heard they're  Finally crafted  He's got two cases  Like CIA  He looks like  It's like he's  Carrying the bomb  Do you go down  You go down to Brazil  With these things  Yeah  Look I want to engage  In evil every day  That I'm there  I can't take that  Viagra man  That stuff will kill you  Yeah  So I just engage  Why would you mean  It'll kill you  So to get  Mess with your heart  All right 
[03:36:00]  So to get the good rods  You have to go down  This path  Right  The regular sex to you  Is like whatever  You need some craziness  Involved  Yeah  Just for visual  A little weirdness  For visual  So you taking these toys  And using them on chicks  Gives you that visual  Sing  Yeah some of them  That's why I have glass  It's very safe  All right  Well get the  Get the cases out  Yeah I would love to see  Anthony really fast  You want to read this  We told you guys  Patrice we'll get back  To you in one second  We have so much crap  Going on here today  We told you guys  Hot 97  The tsunami  Sawing that we 
[03:36:30]  Finally get dragged  Into this whole mess  Yeah  And we got an update  From Inside Radio  Inside Radio reporting  There's an Opie and Anthony  Connection to the  Hot 97 tsunami song mess  And that's the headline  Opie and Anthony  Connection  The producer of Miss Jones  The producer of Miss Jones' show  On Hot 97 is Rick Delgado  Who produced Opie and Anthony's show  For WNEW until the infamous  Sex and St. Pat stunt  Now Delgado  Miss Jones and the rest  Of Hot 97's morning crew  Are on indefinite suspension  For airing the  We are the world parody  That uses racial terms  Against Asians 
[03:37:00]  We're not saying that  Rick's responsible  For what happened  In either controversy  But he probably feels  He's been at ground zero  Two times too many  And then they go into  Meanwhile McDonald's  Pulled its ads off in 97  The Hot 97  Followed by tax prep firm  Jackson Hewitt  Uh oh  And Sprint  Also an online petition  Demands that MS fire  The entire morning show  Has now gathered  Over 30,000 signatures  And there's that demonstration  At Hot 97's  Hudson Street Studios  This morning at 11 o'clock 
[03:37:30]  MS faces some tough choices  If the noise level  Doesn't diminish soon  So Rick and us  Getting tied into the whole thing  That's the latest  But we said they would  Drag our names into it somehow  And we have nothing  To do with this  No nothing  Go find your mommy  Oh is that the worst  Song parody  Rick moved on from our show  And he was producing  This morning show  And we think he wrote the song  But we have nothing  To do with it  With a tree right through her head  I was supposed to have that job  That the other guy  I was supposed to be  That was supposed to be my job  How's your singing voice  Would you have been able to 
[03:38:00]  I would have said no  But that's why I didn't  I didn't do it  You gotta raise your hand  To talk and everything in there  It's the worst  I want to do it  You know Miss Jones is like  Blah blah blah blah blah blah  And then you gotta go  And then Rick came in  And when I did it  Hey man you gotta raise your hand  I'm like what  Rick do you even know me  He forgot you too right  You have to raise your hand  No bullshit  Dude we have a messed up show  It's like just  Everyone talk  We don't care  Talk at the same time  No one gets like credit here  We all just have fun  It's all about having fun 
[03:38:30]  No egos or any of that  Crap  That's why I love you guys  Thank you  Okay I'm gonna  I'm gonna go out of my character  And really kiss your ass  And your mouth is full of food  I know  You let  Yeah  You let  People be funny  Comics talk for  Exactly  I'm telling you  You can't have more fun  On anything else  Than this  Yep  Okay is that good enough  That's very good  Ass kissing  Cause there's a lot of people  That have egos  And they're self conscious  And stuff  And they  At the end of the day  Have to be the funniest person  On their radio show  And Anthony and I  Figured out a long time ago 
[03:39:00]  You know  Patrice is killing today  Voss is killing today  When I go talk to my people  After today  They're gonna all say  Wow that was a  You guys were really funny today  No  Well maybe we were a little bit  But you killed today  We still get the credit  For having a funny show  And Anthony was funny  I'm raising my hand  Oh  Nice visual  I'm not lying dude  Raise your hand  When I came in there  Cause I knew her  And I came in there  And she sort of treated me  Like Opie treated me today  So  I wasn't that bad  When I came in  I was just distracted 
[03:39:30]  We're gonna do an interview  And you know  I was sitting in this chair  I went to sit in there  And she came in and goes  That's somebody else's chair  Didn't even say hi  I go hey baby  Hey baby  Stuck her middle finger  Right at me  So I was okay  I see how this is gonna be  So  They were trying to treat me  Like the new kid  At the high school  So  Now you know  How do you  How do you work in that environment  How do you have any fun  Don't find your mommy  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  Wow  We don't know  What's gonna happen  We thought they were gone  Screaming chinks  Why  We thought they were gonna fire them  But it looks like they're gonna  I don't know  I think they're gonna try 
[03:40:00]  To ride the storm  I think they'll fire them  Friday's always the fired day  What's that  What is indefinite suspension  What's that code  Is that code for fired  Or code for  Code for fired  Indefinite suspension  Is code for  They're already fired  We just have to figure out  What to do with their contracts  Who we're putting in here  That they're done  And there is no  Trace of them  On the website  On the website  Yeah  Oh they're gone  On the website  That's a biggie  And McDonald's pulls their ads  The tax firm pulled their ads  Sprint Telephone pulled their ads  And they pulled their ads 
[03:40:30]  For an indefinite period of time  Until they said  Big changes are made over there  Right  They want them fired  Sponsors definitely control  Radio programs  A lot of people talk about  The FCC  It's like  Well yeah  Gotta worry about that  A little bit  And fines  But you gotta worry  About the big sponsors  When these sponsors  Are a lot more  These Asians  Ran to McDonald's  And said  Look what you're advertising on  You know  Get off of there  Oh my god  And people don't listen to Asians  They're not  Like the top  Getting you fired  No  Getting people riled  Black people are the best  Jews, blacks, and then Latinos 
[03:41:00]  Blacks are better than Jews  Blacks are better than Jews  Because the Jews fire you  At raising a ruckus  At raising a ruckus  Blacks don't get to fight  As well as Jews do  I think if you make  A racial epithet  Or a racial comment  A derogatory racial comment  On TV or radio  And it's against blacks  Or Jews  Blacks will get you in trouble  Faster than Jews will  But blacks don't get you fired  Blacks complain to the people 
[03:41:30]  That own the companies  Which are the Jews  And then the Jews fight  I can't argue with that  I mean you know more than me on that  But I just never felt like  We'd get people fired  I think Jews take it a little easier  They're like you know  Jews are more gassed  You know  And Wasp heard about this thing  This is the thing  Chinese people  And then all the O'Reilly's  And the Hannity Home  They don't have it  O'Reilly's such a hypocrite  O'Reilly's an ass  He really is an ass  I bought some of these dildos  From O'Reilly  Exactly  He loves it  Now these things  I say that's to love you  These dildos 
[03:42:00]  You just open this thing up  Like James Bond  I know  A suitcase and stuff  Q gave him  He's got  You know  He's got suitcases  With combination locks on them  Yeah  If you put that into something  Then it's  The arrow  The arrow security guard  Downstairs winked at me  And said  Is this  Is this going down now  What  Oh that's great  Alright partner  I gotcha  Why are these glass  Why are they glass  Because it's safer  And where do you get  Glass dildos from  From the glass dildo shop 
[03:42:30]  How much do you spend on that  Glass dildos or rust  Is there  I have thousands of dollars  Worth of sex  I really did go in  Look I can't argue the loneliness man  Well I know  This looks like the missing scene  From Pulp Fiction  When Marsalis Wallace  Opens the briefcase up  The tree sitting there  Next to the glowing dildos  And somebody should read off  Some bible terms  And then shoot me for this  And you will know  When my glass dildo 
[03:43:00]  Goes inside you  That I am the lord  When I lay my dildo  Upon thee  Maybe the dildo's the shepherd  And I'm the righteous man  And you're snatch  And I got  And the thing is  I don't corrupt it  You know  You know  You corrupt  A few girls  And they get  They love it  Yeah  And it just gets deeper and deeper  And they trust me 
[03:43:30]  That when I bring  Weirder and weirder stuff  They had trusted me  From the weird stuff before  So they're like  I got nipple  Things  You put a nipple on  And suck the nipple in  Which I don't get  But  There is  Wow  That is odd  Voss is holding it  With his sleeve  Because he doesn't want to touch it  Yeah okay come on  How do you clean those  Do you boil them  Yeah you  It looks like a popsicle stick  What do you get one of those girls in here to try it  You clean them well  You know what I'm saying  Because they're glad  Are you scared this will chip off into the  Nah man  It's not as pirates anyway 
[03:44:00]  You're not beating them with it  What the hell's on the other day  Look at that  What gets me is  How do you follow that  You don't  Like he said  It's  You don't  It's like  The thing he just said  Is always in context  Right  The dude just said  He doesn't bother comics  Because he's going to end up  Getting the credit for the situation  Yeah yeah  This  I get credit for their orgasms  This is not  I'm not following this  I'm just attached  She's attaching me to the whole  The whole process  Yeah the process  You can't follow it  Another guy can't follow it  Do you name these things  There's all sorts of different sizes  We got to explain  Because it's radio  A lot of  Oh I'm sorry
