<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a nostalgic look back at their early, low-rated days on WNEW.  The hosts played numerous audio clips of irate listeners calling in, frequently using profanity to express their disgust with the show's offensive content and on-air antics.  These clips highlighted the listeners' initial anger, which gradually transitioned into a begrudging acceptance, and even enjoyment, of the show's irreverent style.  One caller even suggested another listener drive into a tree.  A comedic segment followed, featuring a fake Dice Clay impersonator who had previously ridiculed their poor ratings.  This was contrasted with their current, top-rated status, with the hosts playing the impersonator's scathing critique.  Further audio clips included a woman who initially hated the show but eventually became a fan;  a call where the hosts were repeatedly called "suck"; a bizarre exchange with a caller seeking clothing directions; and a lengthy, convoluted "runaround" call attempting to reach a station employee named Carol Miller.  A news story about a herdsman stoned to death by monkeys sparked a humorous, profane discussion between Opie and Anthony.  The segment concluded with a discussion about Spaz, a regular contributor, and his experiences in a gay play, including unwanted touching by a fellow actor – a story recounted with explicit language and sexual innuendo. Brian Regan was mentioned as a guest, along with Ron and Fez (other show hosts).

The show continued with a caller detailing an awkward acting experience, specifically unwanted genital touching during a romantic scene.  The caller described the incident in detail, including the other actor's "European underwear with the outline," and explained his laughter as a nervous reaction. The hosts then moved on to a discussion of the Fox show "Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?", focusing on the groom's past violent behavior revealed by a restraining order. This led to a lengthy, offensive bit involving a call from Mike Tyson, who offered extremely vulgar and violent suggestions for selecting a bride on a similar show.  The segment also featured the hosts' enthusiastic (and sometimes reluctant) consumption of novelty genitalia-shaped chocolates, heavily involving Rick, who was urged to eat a chocolate penis by a female guest in the studio.  Also present in the studio were Crystal Storm, a dancer with large breasts, whose presence prompted considerable discussion regarding their size and involved a breast-related “trick”.  Ken Stevens, their new boss, briefly appeared, admitting to peeking into the studio because of Crystal Storm.

A caller (along with his brothers, Elmo and Brett) then recounted their unconventional childhood and a disastrous family vacation, including a runaway teenager, extensive cement work around their house, a near-drowning at "Rolling Rapids," and a trip to their deceased uncle's burned-down upstate property, where they encountered his charred remains.  The story involved numerous insects and humorous anecdotes from the brothers.  The conversation shifted to a Marilyn Monroe memorabilia auction and the high prices paid for her bikinis, followed by humorous speculation about their scent and potential evidence of flatulence.  The segment concluded with a live "resisting arrest" bit involving two female police officers in the studio handcuffing Opie, Anthony, and Rick, resulting in humorous accounts of the struggle. Bill and Joe (Anthony's brother) and several other unnamed individuals also participated.

The final segment played a secretly recorded audiotape of Spaz's disastrous stage announcement at the strip club, Privilege.  Spaz, apparently intoxicated, delivered a rambling, poorly received introduction, highlighted by his attempts at humor which fell flat with the unresponsive audience.  The hosts heavily criticized his performance, describing it as a "bomb" and highlighting his lack of audience engagement.  Studio guests, Steve and Anthony, who were present at the strip club that night, corroborated the account, describing the negative audience reaction and Steve mentioning numerous people leaving after Spaz's set.  Anthony also recounted yelling at Spaz to leave the stage. Listener emails and calls, ranging from humorous to angry, were then read, followed by more of Spaz's increasingly desperate and loud introduction, culminating in him finally introducing the strippers, Misty Knight and Ashley Starr.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The award-winning Opie and Anthony Shove.  This has got to be a joke, people!  Hey, baby, baby!  WBW.  212-757-1027 is the phone number for the O&A show.  Want to say hi to Ryan in North Carolina, Anthony?  Yes.  Listening to the show today at Duke University. 
[00:00:30]  You guys rock. Keep it up.  Thank you, Ryan.  We're syndicated, right?  Um, underground.  People are making fun of us.  We're the highest-rated show in NEW history, officially.  We did our research. We looked it up.  What a goof that is.  Pretty much a goof.  Out of all the years WNEW has been on...  90s?  Well, 80s. 
[00:01:00]  I remember hearing...  Yeah, so intro a cranberry song.  Here's Linger by the cranberry.  The cranberry.  This is what I'm doing.  Okay.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Yes.  Anthony, so Rick dug up some tape from the early years of the O&A show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When we were officially the worst show in NEW history. 
[00:01:30]  Last place.  Last place.  Last place.  God, that sucked.  Oh, my God.  When we inherited the afternoon drive slot here in NEW YORK, the show was in last place.  Last place.  Last place.  That was it.  Book after book after book.  Oh.  We're in last place.  The ratings would come out.  We'd hope to see a little uptick or something.  And what did we get?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Still last place.  Now, first place. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you.  But someone that sounded just like Dice was on the show abusing us about two years ago.  Not as much like Dice as I've heard him sound, but it must have been an off day for us.  See, back then, like, you know, we couldn't have the real Dice, so we had Anne Faking the  Dice, you know.  That's how things have changed now that we've gotten some popularity and stuff.  We can get the real Dice on the show.  See how things have changed a little bit, Anthony?  So the fake Dice was on the show. 
[00:02:30]  So complimenting us, I guess, on our recent ratings success.  Yeah.  When we looked at the ratings and we were on the last page and we were in last place.  Uh-huh.  Here's the fake Dice.  On top of the world, huh?  Yeah.  You're scooping on me, calling me a has-been and a hack.  Yeah.  And now where are you?  Let me look in the paper.  Here we go.  Contrary to popular belief, the Dice man can read.  Oh!  Let me look. 
[00:03:00]  N-E-W.  Number one?  No, a long shot.  You've got to be in the top ten, right?  Because you're just so funny, ain't you?  Let me look.  No, not in the top ten.  Let's go down a little further where you was last rating book.  What was that, huh?  We were in 21st place.  21st place.  Oh, you was kicking ass, huh?  Let's look.  21st.  Oops.  You're not there neither.  Oh, here it is.  W-N-E-W.  24th place. 
[00:03:30]  Last place, loser.  Oh, huh?  You've got as many people here listening to you as came to my last gig at Laugh-Your-Balls.  I think there were three people there.  Hey, loser.  Yeah, we got it.  Feels good last place, huh?  Well, now we can hang out with you, you know?  You are bigger losers than me.  Oh, you jackass.  Look at you, you two snapper heads.  In last place, trying to throw yourself to party.  You're blowing horns. 
[00:04:00]  Get on the streets, you blow something else.  Hey, Gabby!  Hickory dickory dog.  Hoping and Anthony, you're in last place.  Hey, Gabby!  It don't rhyme, but it's true.  Oh, God!  No more chicks coming up going,  Oh, Opie, I want to make love to a number one radio star.  Hey!  Down the road to the Spanish station, honey.  Who's in first place, Mega? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, Spanish station here in New York.  Spanish?  Yep, yep.  What's up with that, guys, huh?  Well, they...  Why don't you start talking Spanish?  I don't know any Spanish.  Say Taco Bell or something.  Hey, hey, fajita.  Hey, you're number 22 now.  With a bullet.  You snapper heads.  Look at you.  All right.  You're just all beaten.  All right.  I know the feeling, loser.  Yeah, we're going to hang out together, all right?  I can do your show now, huh?  Yeah, you can.  Loser, I won't even stay here with you two. 
[00:05:00]  You wouldn't?  Wait a minute.  I'm leaving.  Wait a minute.  The dice man is leaving.  Wait, you won't even hang out with those dice?  You're losers.  We're that pathetic?  Losers.  All right, get out of here.  Wow, we're so pathetic, dice won't even hang with us anymore.  He took my mic again.  I know.  I hate when he does that to you, Aaron, because I need some help when he's in here.  I can't defend myself alone.  Oh, God.  Okay, great.  So, uh...  No, that's my dice.  The party continues.  It's an exciting day here in New York. 
[00:05:30]  Everyone's celebrating the fact that Yanks are going to the World Series, and...  And, well, we're celebrating that we're in, um...  Last place.  And we're so pathetic that I don't even think the donuts are going to arrive.  All we wanted was a nice cake that says, congratulations on last place.  Last place.  Something like that.  But, no.  No.  Okay.  Thanks.  There you have a look back, Anthony.  How things have changed, huh?  Oh, the Yanks were going to the World Series, top of the world, and we were in last place. 
[00:06:00]  And all we wanted was a cake back then.  Never got the cake.  Now we're in first place.  We still don't get a cake.  Well, we got the wow cake yesterday from the French chef, but...  Yeah.  That was kind of nice.  We're the salespeople with our, like, cake and stuff.  Yeah, remember that?  We got a cake and stuff, and the sales staff came down and gave us, uh, some goodies.  Yeah.  Now they just, you know, they're too busy selling the show.  Making money.  Making money, finally.  They actually could sell this place. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  They would go to, like, the matinee every day and make believe they were selling.  They couldn't sell this place when we first got here.  Oh, it was a disaster.  They had no one to see.  They would just tell, like, the sales manager, oh, no, we're going out to try to sell the place.  And they would catch, like, uh, I don't know, the two o'clock showing of The Matrix.  We had no live reads.  Nothing.  Barely any commercials.  No.  We were playing horrible rock and roll.  It just sucked.  John, what's going on? 
[00:07:00]  Hey, how you doing?  We're doing well, John.  Oh, you guys were in last place because nobody knew who you were.  Oh, we understand that.  A radio show, you're doing it the way you want to do.  You're not listening to anybody.  You're not taking any crap from anybody.  No, we can't.  You're number one.  We give you guys a lot of credit because we became word of mouth, which is very, very cool.  You guys are stellar.  You really are.  Thank you.  Look at that.  We needed that.  No, please.  And we found some more tape looking back, like, uh, than, like, other jocks that work in the city. 
[00:07:30]  They found out we're in last place.  They started calling and ragging on us and stuff.  Oh, yeah?  I don't think this, uh, this particular jock works for our company, so I think we could play it on our show tonight.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Hi, boys.  It's Bob Grant.  You, you buffoons.  You're hooligans and buffoons.  You're horrible.  No wonder you're in last place.  Fetch him.  You're a coven.  Well, do you have any advice for us, Mr. Grant? 
[00:08:00]  Get out of the air, you jackasses, buffoons with your vulgarity.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  All right.  Well, thanks, Mr. Grant.  Yeah.  That was nice of him to call back then.  Yeah, the early days.  Chris from downtown.  I've been listening since the day Opie told the lady to drive her car into a tree.  I haven't stopped listening since.  Drive into a tree.  Well, we finally had it.  People would call up and tell us how much we suck day in and day out. 
[00:08:30]  I just finally said, just do yourself a favor and just drive into a tree.  You didn't go, whoa!  Freak out, did you?  No, I did not, Anthony.  Kelly, what's going on?  Hello.  Hi, Kelly.  What's up?  Oh, God.  When you guys first came on the air, I wanted to kill you.  Why?  I mean, you guys were like the most vile thing ever to my feminism, to everything.  Yeah.  And now I'm, like, totally cool with it, totally have evolved into the humor, and, you 
[00:09:00]  know, you're pretty cool.  That's what happened.  Oh, my God.  You, like, deprogrammed me.  Well, thank you.  All right.  See you.  Bye.  Rick, working really hard behind the scenes today, you found one of those calls where  we're trying to tell the lady to shut the hell up.  Oh.  Is this the driving to the tree?  You know, for years, I've tried to call this radio station.  It would be busy for hours.  But now nobody's calling because nobody listens to you because Opie and Anthony suck.  That's the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life. 
[00:09:30]  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  Did we make fun of you, Bill Clinton?  You are, too.  What's the matter?  You wish you were Monica, don't you?  Well, I guess I'm rock and roll again.  Ah, shut up.  We've had it with you.  You suck.  Kick my ass.  You're the same person I called last week to say you're not listening.  And you're listening.  Bye-bye.  Ah!  Ah! 
[00:10:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  We were losing our minds.  Yeah, we really were.  Because you can even hear it in our voices.  We're like, oh, damn, she's right.  Oh, I'm listening.  No one's listening.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Yeah, well, yeah.  Well, you, you suck, too.  Man.  Alex from Jersey.  Please, please, play the time you compared any W to a 17-year-old dog with one good leg.  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  I forgot about that.  Can we find that?  I don't even know where to look for that one, man.  Whatever.  I got five words for you.  I can buy some clothes.  Yeah.  That one was great.  Someone asked for that?  Yeah.  Oh, I got it right here.  I can buy some clothes.  Play all the tapes from the early days.  I can buy some clothes.  Here it is.  Some foreign lady looking for clothes and got us.  The early days of the old age show. 
[00:11:00]  Last place days.  I know we've only been here two years.  I'm not trying to fool anyone, but...  All right, here's a...  Can I get some clothes?  Hi, ma'am.  What are you looking for?  I can get some clothes.  You want to get some clothes?  Yes.  You need a turban?  We got some beautiful lingerie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something and t-shirt and sweater.  You want a sweater?  Yes.  It's 90 degrees out, ma'am.  Okay.  What is the address? 
[00:11:30]  46 Avenue and 5th and 6th Street.  46?  Yeah.  Excuse me.  Let me write the address.  Yeah.  You better write it down.  Make a left at the...  Okay.  Starting.  The elevator up to the French Street.  Okay.  We're on 1-4-3-3.  1-4-6?  Yeah.  Between 3 and 1.  1-4-6 between 1?  Yeah.  One floor up from Hooters.  Write this down.  It's very important.  You got to take a strengthener at the Fox Street.  It's only there's the elevator up to the constant floor.  Right on the promenade at the Cox Street.  1-4-6 between...  Between San Francisco and the Fox Street. 
[00:12:00]  You can't miss it.  Just go down to the...  And then Timmerweiser's down to the left side.  But the other men give me the other address.  Yeah.  You'll see it right next to the Fox Street.  With the...  46 Street between 10 and 11 Avenue.  Exactly.  Just make sure you get the right elevator because it's on the concert floor back to the promenade  and it's going up and right up the...  Okay.  At what time do they open?  We're open until Mountaineer.  12 o'clock?  At 12 o'clock.  At 12 o'clock.  And what time should we expect you?  About 3.30. 
[00:12:30]  Well, the problem is we're only open on 2...  What is that?  3.30 the front day.  Oh?  We close early sometimes on the climate because of the...  Oh, you close early sometimes?  Sometimes because of the Fox Lumps time.  Okay.  That's a very big hospital.  You got our phone number?  Yes, I have it.  Let me give you the special direct line.  Okay, the special one?  Yeah.  Okay.  It'll get right through to us, okay?  Okay.  That's 7.30.  7?  Yeah, 3.9.  7.3?  And the 5.6.9. 
[00:13:00]  I don't hear you very well.  7?  Yeah.  7.1?  And the 5.6.9.  And then the...  I don't hear you very well.  Don't forget the...  All right, read that back to me, please.  The first letter is 7, right?  Right.  The second one.  Now, read that back, please. 
[00:13:30]  I don't hear you.  How come I can read it?  7.305.  7.305.  7.305.  7.305.  7.305.  7.305.  7.305.  7.305.  7.305.  7.305.  Forget it.  When I'm coming, I will let you know.  All right.  Okay.  I hope I was able to help you.  Okay.  All right.  We were angry.  Yeah.  These are the feedback coming like crazy.  Nick from Pelham.  You guys are like the ugly kid that keeps hitting on the hot girl.  Eventually, all of New York just stopped fighting and gave in. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Give up.  Dan from Hoboken.  I started listening to you because of calls like the one we played from the complaint lady.  Yeah.  I was driving home from college in spring of 98 and I heard you guys go off on call  us for two straight hours.  I haven't stopped listening since.  We just had it.  Everyone hated us.  Yeah.  Just hated us.  It was rough.  Right.  Rick ran down the hall and got, what is this?  Another lady complaining about our language or something?  These are all from us. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  People weren't used to any W having personalities on.  Right.  They were used to jocks that played songs and said, hey, that was the Steve Miller band.  You know, hey, there was the Hendrick.  Hey, let's get the lead out.  You know, it wasn't really personality driven.  No.  So when we got on and did anything more than just intro a song, they lost their minds.  Right.  And forget about doing stuff that they never, ever thought they'd hear on any W, like a 
[00:15:00]  little risque humor or something, or just a conversation.  They freaked out.  All right.  Here's someone complaining.  What can I do for you?  Well, I kind of want to know what I heard when I started my car about 20 minutes ago with  four kids in my car listening to foul language inadequately bleeped out, something I have never  heard on any W before.  Oh, my God.  I've been listening for years.  Oh, my God.  What curses did you hear?  I'm not repeating that.  Don't try to pull me in to your sophomoric entertainment. 
[00:15:30]  Sophomoric.  Sophomoric.  Hey, we're more freshman-like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  Maybe more like two-year-olds, okay?  Oh, that hurts.  Oh, that hurts.  Wow.  I know you are, but what am I?  It should.  Excuse me.  All I've got to say to you guys is shut up and play me some rock and roll.  And I've got to say, you'll keep listening, and we'll keep pissing you off, and there's  nothing you can do about it.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  Your kids probably hear worse when you're yelling at your husband. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, you guys are so funny.  You sound like a nag.  It's funny.  You guys are so funny.  How long ago did your husband leave you?  How long ago was it?  Tell me.  You know I'm right.  No, you're not.  How long ago was it?  No, you're not.  You threw him out, right?  How long ago?  Come on.  You little pet dad.  Good father.  We got you.  We got you.  You're good, Angela.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  That's great.  You've come a long way.  Now we're doing Teen Week on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Teen Week.  God, that was so funny. 
[00:16:30]  Any of these people that we're playing the phone calls from, if you're still listening, please  call.  Yeah.  I'd love to hear from you.  Good to see her calling out.  I love the show.  I want to bring my daughter down for teenry.  I don't know what happened.  For teen butts next week.  Oh, please do.  All right.  What?  This is a good one, too?  This is a good one, too.  Annie W. Complaints.  Yeah.  Hi.  I want to complain about these two idiots you have there in drive time.  I've been listening to the station since the day it came on the air.  I want to work with you, sir.  What seems to be your problem with these gentlemen? 
[00:17:00]  They just had a woman on the phone who called us to complain about foul language.  Right.  And they're telling her, and they're telling her, don't worry, you'll keep listening and we'll  keep pissing you off.  What is that?  And you don't think that's right for them to put on somebody that wants to voice a  legitimate...  About anger.  You feel it degrades them.  You feel it degrades the caller and makes them seem stupid.  It absolutely does.  And not only that, I mean, forgetting for a minute about the call...  Right.  Yes.  Just in this station. 
[00:17:30]  This station has gone downhill.  Oh, my God.  Remember that one?  Do we have any more?  These are hilarious.  I forgot about all these.  Jay, remember, it's phase one.  Remember?  The plan.  Phase one.  The purge.  The purging of the old listener.  Right.  Remember, we had to purge.  Phase one.  Phase one.  Just get everyone really pissed off.  Really pissed because the older listeners...  Stop listening.  The older listeners from N.E.W., the ones that wanted the classic rock, weren't really going 
[00:18:00]  to stick it out.  A large portion of them were not going to stick it out once we came on.  Yeah.  So we just figured we'd do whatever we could to chase them away.  Mm-hmm.  Goodbye.  Be gone.  Be gone.  And, uh...  Boy, we tried hard, but they didn't seem to go away.  Which one is that?  The J.J. Skinner?  Oh, yeah.  J.J. Skinner.  Because we still had to give concert info and stuff.  Yes.  Band info.  Make believe we cared about, like, Leonard Skinner coming to town again. 
[00:18:30]  Yes.  Hello?  Can I help you?  Hi.  I was listening the other day.  Yes.  And, um, you played a song, and after the song, they said it was J.J. Skinner, They Call  Me the Breeze.  Yes.  And I...  We started doing that, too.  We made up our own names for the band.  We didn't care.  I mean, come on.  I mean, like, you listen to a classic rock station in town, you've heard Leonard Skinner  a million times, and the jock has to always come on and go, that was Leonard Skinner's  Sweet Home Alabama.  Like, you don't know.  Exactly.  So, and I would just start making up names. 
[00:19:00]  We started calling Leonard Skinner, like, J.J. Skinner, and J.J. Skinner.  All right.  Just...  I'm just gonna...  Look, I'm just giving the sit-up.  Get it, Ray.  Just listen to the bit, and you guys just keep going, and this woman buys it all the time.  Oh, I know.  All right, let me start over again, because we just didn't care anymore.  Hello?  Can I help you?  Hi.  I was listening the other day.  Yes.  And you played a song, and after the song, they said it was J.J. Skinner, They Call Me  the Breeze.  Yes.  And I can't find that anywhere. 
[00:19:30]  I can't even find somebody called J.J. Skinner.  Well, that's strange.  Yeah.  And then I went in, like, on the internet, and I tried to find, like, keywords, the breeze.  Yes.  And I couldn't even find anything on that.  Yeah, it's J.J. Skinner.  Who is that?  He's a guy, a local artist.  He also did that Freebird song.  Freebird?  Yeah.  J.J. Skinner.  Does he have, like, a CD?  Yeah, a couple.  You know, he was kind of popular in the 70s, J.J. Skinner. 
[00:20:00]  Also had a song called What's That Smell?  So would there be a CD with that song on it?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, of course there would be.  Like, what do you think?  Oh, just go to any record store and ask for, you know, J.J. Skinner.  Right.  They call me the breeze.  Probably in the same section as, like, you know, the Bobby Daniels band would be.  Yeah, I've heard that.  They didn't have that.  Frog Hat.  Have you ever heard of Frog Hat?  Frog Hat?  Frog Hat.  They're good.  No.  Great band from the 70s as well. 
[00:20:30]  Frog Hat.  Yeah.  Okay, so J.J. Skinner is the real person.  Yeah.  Yeah, J.J. Skinner, yeah.  The Baldwin Brothers.  Did you ever hear of the Baldwin Brothers band?  No.  J.J. Skinner also did Give Me Three Steps, Give Me Three Steps Toward the Door.  Oh, I know that one.  Oh, there you go.  That's J.J. Skinner as well.  So, I went into all these, like, big stores and I couldn't find anything on with them.  Well, they're right next to the Med Zeppelin section.  Okay. 
[00:21:00]  A doctor group that had some hot tunes in the late 70s.  Okay.  All right.  So, I'll just go back to the store then.  Yeah, go right back to the store.  Go to the front counter and, you know.  I did that.  I even tried Amazon.com.  J.J. Skinner, huh?  He wasn't even listed in there.  You know what?  It's probably the same section as Molly Hammer.  Yeah.  So, it's like...  They did Flirting with Disaster.  You ever hear that?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Molly Hammer.  Yes, Molly Hammer.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  They might have a retro section that has all these great bands.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Okay.  All right?  All right.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Good luck to you.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye.  See, you listeners have gotten a little better, too, haven't you?  The listeners completely changed.  Yeah.  That's what we used to get.  You don't sound as stupid when we go to the phones now.  Michelle, what's up?  Hello?  Hi, Michelle.  You're on the radio.  Hi.  Hi.  I just wanted to call and say that you guys have me hysterical, laughing, driving, listening  to these calls with that Haitian woman.  No, yeah.  Can I get some clothes?  I can get some clothes.  I just said you had me as I had such a bad day and that you guys just made my day. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, thanks, Michelle.  And I just wanted to tell you also that I went to the zoo like two weeks ago.  Yeah.  And this little kid was behind me.  He was about four years old.  And I'm on the monorail.  And he's saying, whip him out Wednesdays.  And who has my mojo?  And his mother was putting her hand over his mouth because she was so embarrassed.  Oh, cool.  So he's like four years old.  That was so cool.  All right, Michelle.  Thank you.  Okay.  You guys suck.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Jim real fast. 
[00:22:30]  Jim, what's up?  I just wanted to say, you guys used to be so very annoying.  I don't know.  Wait, let me say something, though.  We're still annoying.  Yeah.  We're still annoying.  You are, but it's a different annoying now.  Yeah.  Like you're part of the annoyance.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, no, certainly.  We work hard at it.  That's for sure.  It used to be like, Ant and I just flat out annoying every listener.  Now we do have to purge.  Right.  Well, you know what you guys do now?  You guys don't annoy the listeners.  You have people come in to annoy the listeners. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Like OBB.  Yeah.  Cool.  Usually, if you want to go from one in the book to 24 again, keep bringing him on.  But beyond that, you guys are doing a good job.  Hey, thank you, buddy.  You got it.  All right.  Where are some of those transfer calls?  Yeah, a lot of people are requesting the runaround calls, we like to call them.  Yeah.  What's the big pussy call?  Oh, yeah.  This lady.  We would get calls that people were complaining about us and stuff, and they would call here. 
[00:23:30]  They would call us.  Right.  And ask for who they can complain to.  We got two things here, though.  One lady called us personally because she was pissed because we used the word pussy on the radio.  Oh, right.  Pussy.  This isn't a tape from 1968.  This is two years ago.  So, here it is.  He calls up complaining because we used the word pussy.  Hi, A.W.  Is this Opie or Anthony?  Both.  I was just very upset by the use of the word pussy. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, you just used the word.  You just insulted me.  You used the word as pejorative.  What's wrong with it?  There's nothing wrong with pussy.  I haven't heard the word perorative.  Pejorative.  What is your pejorative since I was in high school?  Do you know what it means?  No.  Do I need to know what that word means?  We're using it out of context.  I know I need to know what the word pussy means.  You probably do.  Pussy makes people happy.  It shouldn't be used in a derisive way.  It insinuates that you think pussy is small and weak. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, my God.  My pussy is big and strong.  I'm a pussy woman.  102.7 WNWU.  My pussy is so big.  It's got an ass.  Radiohead.  My pussy is going to come over there and kick your ass.  That's how big it is.  All right, shut up.  We'll get to you next.  It's not wimpy.  It's big, man.  And it's big.  It's coming down the street right now. 
[00:25:00]  And it's going to kick your ass.  WNW, the rock of New York.  I know we're trying to do the radio show.  Karma police.  We'd have people yelling at us while the music was playing.  We'd have them yelling at us as we're trying to do the radio show.  And it's bleeding through on the air.  Oh, my God.  George, what's going on?  Hey, George.  George, make it fast, man.  Yo, you guys got me in tears, man. 
[00:25:30]  My stomach.  I'm going to bleed.  God damn it.  Oh, cool, man.  You guys are the best, man.  I'm telling you, man.  I've been listening for a year and a half.  Oh, man.  Thank you, man.  You've got the good work, man.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  What I was looking forward to was the first time Brian Regan came in and did the whole  this is not what I'm used to.  Yeah, yeah.  The calls are just great.  Like, all the calls we get now are pretty much people that get the show, contribute to  the show.  You know, they have something to add. 
[00:26:00]  The calls then were people that didn't know the format had changed or that we, not even  before the format had changed, they didn't know that we did anything else but played  music.  Right.  So if they heard us doing anything but playing music, they got pissed and called up to complain.  But they didn't know who to complain to.  So a lot of times they would call us and we would just be, okay, hold on.  Complaint department.  Yeah.  And just run right over the calls.  Yeah.  Well, we got one of the runaround calls, Anthony.  The purge.  The time someone called up to talk to Carol. 
[00:26:30]  Yes.  Yes.  It was a pretty famous call.  We felt good about this.  We'll play this as we go to break.  We'll play more of the complaint calls and stuff on the way, okay?  All right.  Carol Miller, runaround.  N.E.W.  I'm a...  Yesterday, I was working and I was in my car and I wanted to respond to something Carol  Miller said.  And it was something positive.  So I pulled over and tried to call you guys.  And I got such a runaround and I never got through to Carol.  Oh, you wanted to find Carol for you? 
[00:27:00]  Well, yeah.  Is she around?  Sure.  Hold on a sec.  Great.  N.E.W.  Yeah.  Hi.  I'm a listener, a fan, whatever.  I'm trying to reach Carol Miller.  Okay.  Responding to some stuff she was talking about yesterday.  All right.  You'll need personnel.  Hold on.  Okay.  Thanks.  Hello, personnel.  May I help you?  Yeah.  Hi.  I'm a 20-year listener and a fan of the show.  Mm-hmm.  Of the station, rather.  And I was trying to reach Carol Miller yesterday and unfortunately, I couldn't get through.  And I was wondering who I can talk to to try to either leave something for her or get 
[00:27:30]  a fax number.  I'd rather talk to somebody, though, but...  Talk to somebody for Carol Miller?  Yep.  Oh, hold on.  You need the jock line?  I'm sorry?  Please hold.  We'll connect you to the jock line.  Jock line.  Okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  Uh, jock line.  Hi.  Hi.  Is this the jock line?  Yes.  Who am I speaking with?  Uh, this is John.  Hi, John.  Hi.  My name is Cindy Reich and I'm at least a 20-year listener.  Hi, Cindy.  Who are you looking for?  I'm looking for Carol Miller who might not still be there, but I'm at work.  Well, I don't...  I tried to reach her yesterday and I couldn't.  I don't see her in the jock lounge.  Hold on. 
[00:28:00]  She might be in the break room.  Hold on a sec, please.  Thank you.  Break room.  Pete Polina.  Hi.  Hi.  They were trying to connect to Carol Miller if she was in there.  Oh, I just saw her go by.  I think she went to her office.  Hold on.  Okay.  Thank you.  Hello, Carol Miller's office.  May I help you?  Yeah, hi.  They're trying to connect to Carol Miller.  Carol Miller.  Who is this calling?  It's a 20-year fan of the station who needs to respond to something she was talking about  yesterday.  Well, I'm sure she'd love to hear from you the thing she's on her way out.  Let me see if I can connect you to the garage.  If not, I'll leave a message.  She can contact me or maybe I'll call her.  Let me try to connect you to the garage. 
[00:28:30]  Thank you.  She might be in her car.  Hold on.  Thank you.  Yeah, garage.  Hi.  They're trying to get Carol Miller so I can respond to her.  I'm a 20-year fan.  I'm just trying to leave her a message in person if I can.  And they said she might be in the garage.  Actually, I can connect you to her car phone.  She just pulled out of here in her Mercedes.  Great.  Hold on a second.  Okay.  Hello?  Carol Miller's car.  Carol?  No, I'm taking Carol's car up to get her.  Oh, okay.  Hello?  They told me I could...  Hold on, please.  Hold on.  Thank you.  Get out of the way, you son of a bitch! 
[00:29:00]  This is Carol Miller's car!  Get away!  Yes, hold on, please.  Okay.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Is Carol around?  I'm a 20-year fan.  They're just trying to reach her and they keep trying to find her for me.  Hey, well, I'm a 30-year-old con-ed worker.  You reached a phone booth.  How can I help you?  You've got to be kidding me.  No, I'm not kidding you.  Who's this?  Are you serious?  Because I was just on the phone with N.E.W.  And they kept connecting me and connecting me and connecting me.  Well, they connected me to a phone booth. 
[00:29:30]  Great.  All right, thanks.  Who's this?  I just told you I'm a fan of N.E.W.  That's trying to reach Carol Miller.  And I don't know how...  I'll tell you, hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Wait, hold on.  Can you connect me back?  I'll see what I can do after I hit the thing.  Hold on, lady.  Okay, thank you.  This is United Flight 36, 7 Heavy.  Hello?  Yes, this is Air Traffic Control.  I don't want to have traffic control.  I was trying to reach Carol Miller, and they keep bumping me around.  Why are you on the aircraft frequency, ma'am?  This is United Flight 7 Heavy. 
[00:30:00]  Can you somehow connect me back to Carol Miller's car phone?  I'm trying to land an airliner, ma'am.  I really don't have time.  Well, it's a crossing of wires.  I apologize.  It's not my fault.  30 degree flaps.  Hold on.  30 degree flaps.  Okay.  Look at your dad.  I'm trying to land an airliner, ma'am.  Okay, goodbye.  Goodbye.  I don't have time.  Goodbye.  It's so cool.  It has nothing to do.  They act like a-hole braggers. 
[00:30:30]  We are the best.  1027.  That's nothing.  Don't cry on me.  WNEW.  I'm going to go over.  Don't you have any self-respect?  Aren't you embarrassed to yourself, to your family?  Hopi and Anthony.  You win human crime.  1027.  WNEW.  All right.  Let's see.  What else did we want to get hit today?  Thirsty monkey?  This, I have to say, is the story of the day. 
[00:31:00]  All right.  How the hell did this happen?  Well, let me read a little bit for you, Anthony.  Thirsty monkey stoned herdsmen to death.  I love this.  Cue music.  No.  In Nairobi, a group of thirsty monkeys stoned a herdsman to death in drought-stricken northern  Kenya as he watered his livestock, a newspaper reported Thursday.  All right.  In a clear sign of worsening drought, a herdsman was killed after the rioting monkey stoned him 
[00:31:30]  at a watering point.  A nurse in the district said the man died from severe head injury.  Good aim on the monkey.  Damn.  All they wanted was a little bit of water.  Could he not spare a few drops of water for these poor primates?  My God! 
[00:32:00]  Just a little taste of water for their red monkey answers.  And everything would have been fine.  He'd have been alive today.  But no, he denied the monkey!  Damn you!  Damn you!  I remember when I needed water.  And Zira came up and gave me a drink of water.  God damn it, I love that monkey bitch. 
[00:32:30]  He gave me water.  I got water from a monkey!  And he wouldn't give water back to these poor thirsty monkeys!  Damn him!  They gave you a lot of water when you were in that cage with that.  No.  It's a mad house!  A mad house!  God damn good aim on the monkey. 
[00:33:00]  Head injury.  Yeah.  Crack shots.  You know, they couldn't hit me with bullets when Doug DeVance was shooting.  But they hit him in the head with rocks.  How does a monkey know that the guy has water and he isn't giving it to him?  I know.  I don't understand this story.  Explain that one.  There's no way the monkey knows he has water.  He doesn't know to pick up rock and throw him at it.  Are you sure this is not a movie? 
[00:33:30]  Maybe they're smarter than we thought, Anthony.  Yes.  They are intelligent.  Smart monkeys.  They live in little clay houses.  I've seen it.  Take your stinking balls off me, damn dirty eggs.  Oh, hold on.  Nova.  Nova.  Look, they're throwing rocks at Nova.  Damn you, monkey.  I just don't get it. 
[00:34:00]  Bunch of riotous monkeys.  Let me get this straight.  Riotous monkeys.  Yeah.  Red-ass stupid monkeys.  Right.  See a sheep herder.  Yes.  Giving water to his sheep.  Correct.  They get mad because he's not giving them water.  Correct.  And they start throwing rocks.  Right.  Why did they just go and take the water?  I don't know.  There was more of them, right? 
[00:34:30]  Yes.  My God.  That's an amazing story.  Either this guy is incredibly stupid, or those are some smart monkeys.  They're all-  God.  I don't know about them.  I might have kicked them in their tiny red asses.  Yes.  Yes.  What's that, Cornelius?  You're is pregnant, and it's not yours. 
[00:35:00]  Dang, you caught me again.  I couldn't, I couldn't take my hands off of her saggy monkey udders.  That red ass is a bullseye for children.  I love it.  Are you sure?  I still, I don't understand.  Are you sure, baby?  Are you sure they weren't drinking malt liquor?  That's all I gotta say. 
[00:35:30]  That'd be.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Maybe it was Reginald Denny.  What?  Yaddle Duden.  Bone dry.  Bone dry, damn you.  Apologize.  Apologize.  No wonder they throw rocks.  Bone dry, bone dry, bone dry. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  Damn monkeys.  I heard they threw 41 rocks.  Yes.  But only 19 hit him.  Right.  But I heard he was down and they kept throwing rocks at him.  Bastard monkeys.  Bastard monkeys.  Why?  Why?  Oh, the guy was just holding his wallet and they threw rocks at him and continued even when I was down.  Why, damn you? 
[00:36:30]  Why?  Why damn you?  Damn.  Damn.  They just said, please, can we have some water in their native monkey tongue?  The shepherd just didn't know how to deal with the monkeys.  No justice, no peace.  Absolutely.  No justice.  Maybe the Yankees can recruit these guys.  He's a cool cat.  He's a cool cat.  Indeed.  He's a cool cat indeed.  He just said, when you see Ryan and his monkeys, give them water, for God's sake. 
[00:37:00]  What's wrong with you?  All right.  I never thought they would have so much.  There'll be a rally at noon tomorrow.  I've never heard this.  What to do?  What to do?  Ryan is his monkey.  All right.  Listen.  Have all the water you like.  What do I mean?  Oh, my God.  It's awful. 
[00:37:30]  Okay.  Terrific.  Yes.  Horrifying.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Keep coming back.  Apologizing.  All right.  Phone number 212-757-1027.  We'll go to the phones next.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And anything?  Do you know what to do?  By fact, don't know.  You decided to push a button. 
[00:38:00]  What button should I push?  Push the pretty red button.  Oh, it's recorded.  That's what you get when you put some professionals on.  1027.  We are a bunch of retards.  WNW.  1027.  WNW is...  The Sport Guys at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Toki and Anthony at 3.  John and Mike at 7.  Next time.  On a very special.  Ron and Fez.  It's a Memorial Day they'll always remember.  What are you doing for Memorial Day, Fez? 
[00:38:30]  Usual.  Painting on a Speedo.  Shaving USA in my back hair.  Sitting around the pool drinking slow gin fizzes.  How about you?  Me?  I'll be commemorating the dominance of the U.S. forces in the Pacific during World War II.  Oh, banging a Japanese chick?  Yeah.  All on the next Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Middays, noon to 3.  1027.  WNW.  We're looking for a few good enemas.  What the hell are you talking about?  Toki and Anthony show. 
[00:39:00]  Crap, whiz, and vomit.  1027.  WNW.  Well, what's up, Anthony?  Hey, man.  The ONA show.  Yes, it is.  It's a great day, Anthony.  Anthony, you want to talk about Clinton real fast?  This is great.  Oh, my God.  All right, I'll read this one.  Clinton finds screensaver amazing.  I love this.  This is the leader of the free world, right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Okay.  President Clinton, who liked to play up his fascination with computers while playing down his experience, 
[00:39:30]  was dazzled on Tuesday by a basic display of software.  A screensaver.  A screensaver.  A screensaver.  He was amazed by a screensaver, ladies and gentlemen.  There's a quote in here.  Yeah.  By Clinton saying, amazing.  He said, Clinton said, as watching a series of coffee cups, deer, and a blackboard form and dissolve on a monitor. 
[00:40:00]  He's amazed by a screensaver.  By a screensaver.  This just goes to show you that these jerk-offs have the speechwriters and everything, and they're publicity people,  and they make their speeches about the Internet.  He's been talking Internet and everything.  Like, he knows what he's talking about.  Computers.  Guy doesn't have a clue.  He's amazed by a screensaver.  A screensaver.  Amazing.  Not by the Sims or some of the great computer games out there.  No.  Nothing.  He's amazed by a screensaver.  Right. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, my God.  The low-key visit with about 30 participants in the class also got Clinton talking about computer games he used to play with his daughter, Chelsea.  They were Freddy's Rescue Roundup and the Carmen Sandiego series of educational games, Anthony.  No, just no porno.  I had to, like, punch up the pornography, like cigars and stuff, but not.  I like that, that, uh, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?  I played that one with, uh, Chelsea.  And, uh, Hillary played where in the world is Bill's penis. 
[00:41:00]  But she wasn't really doing very well at that game up right up until about a year ago.  Then she won.  I lost.  I'm playing some new games.  It was Womb Raider.  Womb Raider, huh?  A gaslight.  New one.  First-person load shooter, they call it.  And it also says that Clinton does not use his office email that much, Anthony. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, what would he be doing?  Hi, I'm 15.  How old are you?  Clinton in the chat room.  That could be pretty funny.  AOL chubby chick chat room.  I like this one.  Do you like cigars?  All right.  How much do you weigh?  Would you like to intern for me, the president?  That is ridiculous.  Clinton's fine screen saver.  Amazing.  Amazing.  Like magic.  Look at that.  And I turned the monitor around and I don't see how they get those pictures in there. 
[00:42:00]  I'm amazed by the whole thing.  Look, there's a picture of fire on the monitor, but I don't feel any warmth.  How they do that.  It's amazing.  Yeah, suck it.  Go ahead.  I'm amazed by the screen.  Suck it.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  You find these things out toward the end of any administration.  Well, the guy at the helm is a stark-raving lunatic.  Yeah, they've run out of things to talk about Anthony at this point, so now they've got to dig deep, you know? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, maybe he wasn't really paying attention to the computer on the monitor when Monica's ass was up there, you know?  I didn't really look at the screen set when I was looking at big brown eyes.  That's amazing.  Amazing.  Look at that.  That's amazing, all right.  My God.  What the hell?  I was wondering what that was, a computer.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  What does it do? 
[00:43:00]  What does that even do?  Suck it.  I got the brown eyes screen saver.  It's amazing.  Opens and closes.  Great.  Screen saver.  Now, what does it do to save a screen?  We must all unite to save the screens.  Like the whales needed our protection in the rainforest, I do now understand.  It's time to save the screens with these amazing screen savers. 
[00:43:30]  Thank you.  I'm amazed by a screen saver.  Holy God.  Oh, you almost cursed there.  Oh, my God.  I'm amazed that he's amazed.  Even Reagan is probably, yes, I know about screen savers.  They don't amaze me.  They amaze Clinton.  Mr. 20th century, 21st century.  Didn't Gore invent the Internet?  Oh, that's what he should know about.  That's what he claims, yes, Anthony.  I want to know something. 
[00:44:00]  Did Clinton and Gore speak at all during eight years together as president and vice president?  Have you ever seen him in the same room shaking hands?  No, that's cracking.  No.  These guys didn't say word, one, not booty each other.  Eight years.  I don't even think they knew each other.  And Al Gore invented the Internet.  Al Gore is my vice president.  I'm amazed.  That's amazing.  I didn't even know what is a vice president.  Who are they kidding?  And they're keeping Clinton as far away from Gore as possible.  Oh, well, Gore is trying to, you know, become president. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  And have Clinton in there.  Ah, whoo-hoo, you know?  Pat, you're next on NEW.  How amused is Bill Clinton about DNA?  DNA.  I can't believe they found me.  I'm amazed.  How'd they find out that was my splooge?  I'm amazed.  Well, there you have it.  The president amazed at a screen saver.  That's something.  You know something?  I've got to admit, I was pretty amazed when I went from, like, my Commodore 64 to my Atari 800 with my cassette load drive. 
[00:45:00]  Sure.  You used to have games on cassette.  I remember that.  And it was a cassette load.  You used to have to type in C-load.  C-load.  C-load.  C-load.  So when the computer's really, I got my first Mac, and, you know, you see the screen saver on it, and the graphics are so sharp, and it's pretty cool, it's moving.  It doesn't look like that pixelated crap you used to get on Atari and Commodore.  I've got to say, I was amazed. 
[00:45:30]  I was amazed.  Well, that's something to be amazed about.  It was also 1983.  I know, right?  I don't think you'd be amazed at that.  But it's the year 2000.  I don't think you'd be amazed at a screen saver.  I'm amazed.  You know what else?  Get this.  You should have a screen saver of Monica giving him a Hummer or something.  I took this TV dinner, right?  I put it in this thing that I like to call the cooking box in the White House.  Pushed a button or two.  It made these amazing beeping noises. 
[00:46:00]  And you know something?  In three minutes, that came out hot.  They called that a microwave oven.  Amazing.  Normally, it would take maybe 20 minutes to thaw and cook that Johnson TV dinner.  Three minutes.  I was amazed.  I ate the whole thing in front of my screen saver.  Are you amazed at beepers, too?  What the hell is that?  You don't know what a beeper is?  No.  Explain.  You can have your girlfriend beep you?  Whoa. 
[00:46:30]  You mean a little thing that beeps when she's calling you?  Yeah.  I am amazed.  God damn, there he is, the president that was talking about leading us into the 21st century.  Amazed by a screen saver.  Not amazed by MP3 files or, no.  Or voodoo graphics called a Bic lighter.  And you move your thumb and there's fire. 
[00:47:00]  No more banging rocks.  I am amazed.  What is it going to take for us to pitch you off to the point  where you're going to change the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  And Anthony.  We just received a PhD in stupidity.  1027.  WNEW.  All right, so if you're a faithful listener to the show, Spaz, who we've kept off the radio 
[00:47:30]  for a while now, thank God, he's finally completed his gay play run.  How many plays were there?  Five.  Five of this classic.  We all remember the first night you said, I don't know, you kind of had a scene where  you had to lay in the bed with this guy and he kind of put his hands through your hair  and as the lights went dim, he made like he was going south to pleasure. 
[00:48:00]  Yes.  That's the scene.  I knew you were supposed to be straight in this play, but I was supposed to be confused  with your sexuality, had one gay experience before this, and now for some reason you're  in bed with this gay guy.  Is this the play or his life we're talking about?  I'm confused now.  He's supposed to seduce me in the play.  Right.  And you're in his bed.  Yeah.  No, he's in my bed.  He comes into my room.  Ah.  Oh, how did that come about?  So you have the homo field advantage. 
[00:48:30]  How did that come about?  How do you invite the gay guy back to your room?  I invite him in.  See, the way this scene starts is that I'm in my bed, like, sobbing.  Like, I'm fighting not to cry because of the tragedy of my life.  And he hears that through the partition in the wall.  So he comes in and he...  Takes the temperature of the old-fashioned way.  He calms me down and introduces me.  He uses the excuse that I want to, you know...  Yes, every day that I'm in bed and if someone's knocking at the door, I just let him in and invite 
[00:49:00]  him into my bed.  What is the point?  You know, no coffee or anything?  I don't invite him in because it's just like a little thin wall with like a little slide  door.  He just walks right in.  I don't...  Oh, he just...  What are you at?  Came right in.  He just...  I walk into...  What are you at?  A bathhouse or something?  Is this supposed to be your apartment?  It's supposed to be...  It was an old house in 1938 in New Orleans.  All right.  And you're just living with gay guys.  No. 
[00:49:30]  One is gay.  The other one...  If he gets a hundred dollars, he'll do it.  And you're supposedly this confused guy.  I'm the confused guy.  So now the gay guy's in your bed.  Do you have to talk about this?  Because I know that a lot of listeners were like happy about Spaz Free.  Oh, shut up.  Okay.  So you're in the bed.  I'm in the bed.  And he's sitting on the bed with you.  Yes.  And now he starts...  The actor starts improvising a little bit. 
[00:50:00]  Yes, a little bit.  Yeah, let's get this straight.  Because basically you all agree that, okay, you'll do this gay scene, but there's no touching.  Right?  Well, there's only two parts where he touches me.  One is when he runs his finger down my arm.  Right.  And the other part is when he puts his arm around my shoulders.  And you agree to that, but no more for this play.  Yes.  But the actor starts improvising.  Yes.  All right, Spaz.  What did the actor do to you during the gay play? 
[00:50:30]  Now, the first couple of nights, he started improvising just a little bit.  Just a little bit.  So what was he doing then?  Well, instead of like a finger, he put his whole hand.  And rubbed down your where?  He would rub down my thigh.  So he's rubbing down his thigh.  And then what was he doing?  You said something with...  I don't know.  What was he doing?  Wasn't he breathing?  Oh, yes.  Like, tickling there.  He rubbed my ear.  He what?  He put his...  Like, he took my earlobe.  Like, he held on my earlobe, shook it a little. 
[00:51:00]  And just...  What is he, Carol Burnett?  So he grabbed your ear?  He grabbed my earlobe, yes.  So he fingered your ear.  He fingered your ear.  He didn't fingered.  He just...  Domino's guy.  What's up?  What's up?  Are you in between delivering pizzas?  Yeah, I do.  So hurry this up.  Take up some Chuck Radios in the Case Underground.  Oh, yeah.  He does a good job.  Thank you, Mike.  Who else?  So he had his hand...  Your ear.  He had his hand all over your ear.  All over your ear. 
[00:51:30]  Did he poke anything in your ear?  No.  No?  He just grabbed onto it.  He just grabbed your ear.  Yeah.  And kind of flitted around with a finger.  But didn't stick anything in your ear.  Did he make it sound like my behind?  No, I'm saying your ear.  Your ear.  My ear.  Yeah.  You're from New York.  This is how...  My ear.  Your ear.  My ear.  Your ear.  Yeah.  We said your ear.  He fingered your ear.  He fingered your ear.  Did he finger your ear?  He grabbed onto it.  Right.  Okay.  So...  But he shook it with his fingers. 
[00:52:00]  Right?  Yeah.  He kind of played with his fingers on your ear.  Yes.  I'm my ear.  Yeah.  That's what I said.  Your ear.  Yeah.  So was he blown into your ear?  Uh, no.  He didn't get that far.  Okay.  All right.  Did he tongue your ear?  No.  I gotta ask.  No.  He did not tongue anything.  Would you consider...  Thank God that...  What he did to your ear a diddle?  Did he diddle your ear?  It's like...  It's like... 
[00:52:30]  It's like...  It's like...  Like...  Saying, like, here's a look at you, kid, type thing.  Would you consider it a diddle?  What do you mean, like, a diddle?  Did he diddle your ear?  What do you mean by that?  I don't know.  I mean, was it a diddle?  You know what a diddle is?  You know what a diddle is?  He just grabbed off on all of it.  He, like, looked at me dead in the eye.  Wait, so he used two fingers?  He used two fingers.  He looked at me in the eye and he shook it a little bit.  Two fingers on your ear?  Wow.  That's fast.  That's all I could say. 
[00:53:00]  Okay.  So that was the first night of improvising.  Yes.  That he did.  So now, the next night, he gets a little more bold with you.  Well, I don't know if this was intentional or not, but...  Ah.  But there's this part where, like, where he's supposed to say, uh, shh, listen to the rain.  And I'm supposed to turn my head away, look out the fake window and look at the rain.  And when he's doing this, he's supposed to say, I'm going to give you this to help you  to sleep.  And he puts his hand underneath the sheet. 
[00:53:30]  And I, I mean, he...  So it's supposed to be, uh, manually doing something.  No, no, he's, no, he's supposed to, yeah, he's supposed to be, like, reaching for it.  Right.  But how are you supposed to hear the rain if he's got a finger in your ear?  No, he just numbs it at the, at the end of the...  All right.  So you're listening to the rain?  Yeah, I'm listening to the rain and he's moving his hand and he kind of nipped it.  Now, now, wait a minute.  What?  He nipped your, your shlong?  Ah!  Bag!  It was unintentional, I'm thinking. 
[00:54:00]  Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!  I never...  Dude.  What do you mean?  No offense, but at that point, you break character.  You break character and you punch him in the head.  Yeah.  I did kind of break character.  I broke character in a different way.  I laughed a little bit.  Oh, you laughed?  Oh, you giggled.  You liked it?  No!  Or you're giggling like a little schoolgirl?  You're giggling like a bitch, man.  No!  No!  No, I laughed...  Look at my rear, my ear.  I did not laugh.  No.  This is the way it happened. 
[00:54:30]  You see, because...  I was not expecting it!  You're huge!  No!  No!  No!  Oh, no!  Did he touch your unit?  He nipped the tip.  Now, I'm not a fag!  He touched the tip.  No, he just, he's like brushed...  Nipped it.  You nipped it. 
[00:55:00]  You didn't even know all the terminology.  Yeah.  No, nothing said.  All right.  And you giggle like a school girl.  I didn't giggle like a school girl.  How did you laugh?  Give us a little laugh.  You broke character.  What did you do?  No, I didn't laugh out loud.  I had this smile on my face like...  What?  Wait, let me tell you something fast.  Play or no play.  Someone's touching my slong, even if they nip into it.  That's not the look that's on my face.  The look on my face is...  Oh, right.  Let me just tell you why I had that, because I was not expecting it. 
[00:55:30]  Because he has a...  This is the type of person who has a tendency to play jokes around it.  Oh, yeah, what a joke.  But the joke's on him, because you're not gay, right?  Yeah, sure.  Don't you add the look of pure shock on your face?  But that's not my...  That's how I react to everything.  That's how I react to everything.  That's like my defense against, you know...  My defense against everything.  No, uncertainty or like...  But he nipped it.  No, laughing is my defense against something if I'm not... 
[00:56:00]  Oh, yeah.  I don't know if it's afraid of something.  I can see you on cell block D just jiggling your ass off.  While you're a new boy.  Hey!  That's good!  Laughing is my defense.  He's tossing my salad.  No, look, I'm tossing salad.  It would never go that far.  Look at me.  Look up.  It would never go that far. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, sure.  So how far would it go if he nipped it?  He nipped it.  I was not expecting it.  And things that I get surprised at, I laugh at.  So you laugh.  Yeah.  So now, moving on.  Right.  There was another instance where he is supposed to take his head and move it down towards your intimate area.  Right.  To simulate that he's...  Hobbing and pleasuring.  Yes.  Right.  So at one point, he gets so close. 
[00:57:00]  Now, Spaz, you are wearing nothing but flesh-colored boxer shorts.  Yes.  And what was he wearing?  He was wearing the European underwear with the outline.  European underwear with the outline.  What is that?  You don't know.  It's like...  It's underwear with...  It's like with the outline.  The feet up.  No, it's like the shape of your thing, but it goes down to your...  It acts like a thumb.  It acts like it's feet up, yes.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  But it's underwear.  So...  Yeah, it's not.  So this guy is obviously gay. 
[00:57:30]  No, he's not.  Please.  He's a respected man.  Well.  Wait.  So now you're...  Look, he's defending his voice.  No, it's just weird.  So are you trying to say that gay people aren't respected?  No.  No, I'm saying...  I'm saying it's like...  You're one of them.  You shouldn't put them down.  Right.  You're not one of them.  No, I'm saying it's for your community.  I'm not making any accusations against anybody because he's a good friend of mine.  I asked if he was gay, and you said no because he's a respected man.  Yeah, I meant no, I'm not going to make that accusation.  Implying that gay people aren't respected.  I'm not going to make that accusation. 
[00:58:00]  You just did.  Again, we have a lot of everything around.  We have a lot of gay listeners.  They're going to be pissed off at you.  I already said that I could be friends with a gay person.  Oh, gee.  You pretty much bedded down with one.  I hope you could be friends.  He's not gay, though.  Wow.  Don't do the gay community a favor, right?  Oh, come on.  I could be friends with a gay person.  Yeah.  Boy, gee, thanks.  So, Pat, so now you're wearing your boxer shorts.  And he's wearing his European little bathing suit or whatever. 
[00:58:30]  Now, I guess the front of the boxers has the normal pole in it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, as he does his little move where he moves south, he gets so close.  What do you feel?  Breath.  You feel hot, steamy man breath on your unit.  What's the reason for that?  There's a reason for that?  There's a reason for that.  The reason for that is that that particular night, that particular night, the lights were 
[00:59:00]  coming down really slow.  Yeah.  So, he has to stretch the scene.  So, what he has to do, he has to hold his position there.  Yeah, hold his position.  So, how does man breath on your penis feel?  How does that feel?  Hot, steamy man breath.  It feels weird.  And what about Razor?  So, what do you think I liked it?  Not once did I get excited. 
[00:59:30]  So, you laughed again, though, right?  What's that?  No, that happened.  No, that.  No.  No, bitch laughs.  I do not laugh like that, all right?  And the man will laugh.  I need to be told something funny.  This stuff isn't funny?  What?  Are you crazy?  No, but at that particular time, I had a look at confusion on my face because I was looking  in the direction of the lighting person.  Looking at your erection, what?  Oh, oh.  Looking at the direction. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, direction.  All right.  So, let me get this straight.  That's French for erection.  You had a look of confusion because you were looking at the lighting director, and that's  why you were confused?  It wasn't because there was man breath on your ear?  No, I was confused at two things.  One is, no, actually, because the slow lighting led to the man breath.  Hot, steamy man breath.  One, nine hundred.  But like I said, it probably was purely unintentional.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, he couldn't just get far enough away. 
[01:00:30]  No, because look, because he had a simulator, so he had to put the blanket up, and he had  his face, like, right there.  Was his head moving?  What?  Was his head moving?  No, not at all.  Did you have your hand on the back of his head?  No, I was just kidding.  No, because he has to tell me to lean back and imagine the paratroopers so I can lean back.  What?  Paratrooper?  Yeah, the paratrooper is, paratrooper was the person I had a relationship with a long  time ago.  Oh, Geronimo.  Yeah, pooper trooper? 
[01:01:00]  Oh, my cord.  Yeah.  Oh, sad, man.  You couldn't find a production of Oklahoma?  Oklahoma.  Opie and Anthony.  Fun, ladies and gentlemen, you guys are really funny and stuff.  But you guys take it too far to the point where I literally get nauseous and sick listening  to your radio show.  Go take a mitle.  All right. 
[01:01:30]  So, Pete Anthony, Simple Chocolates gave us a bunch of chocolates.  And they're novelty chocolates.  They're shaped like pieces of anatomy.  I have a woman's private area molded in chocolate right in front of me.  I've been nibbling on it all day.  And there was a nipple.  I had the nipple.  I had the nipple.  I passed on because I'm just not eating chocolate today.  And Rick was gnawing on this huge chocolate penis. 
[01:02:00]  He comes in like, as a matter of fact, you only have an inch left.  An inch left.  You have an inch left of your chocolate penis.  If you lick it, you'll have the whole thing back again.  Don't even make believe it.  It looks like something else.  We know what it looks like.  Did you eat the plain one or with nuts?  The plain.  Yeah.  Man.  You've been eating that thing all day, right?  That isn't the cream film.  No, not all day.  No, it's not cream film.  It's a cream film.  It melts in your butt, not in your hand. 
[01:02:30]  Well, I wouldn't even think of opening the package,  nonetheless eating it, if it's shaped like that.  Now, there's two.  Especially when in the same bag was women's anatomy,  molded in chocolate.  And you're there.  I'll take the big penis.  Yeah.  Ooh, that looks tasty.  I mean, Rick, come on, man. 
[01:03:00]  Dude, those weren't even offered to me.  The vagina and the nipple was not even offered to me.  All they did was break off a piece of the penis  and hand it to me and say, hey.  You know, at that point, you say, you know what?  No, thanks.  I don't feel like chocolate today  if they're not going to offer you the nipple or the vagina.  Well, I didn't know there was anything else.  No, thanks.  I had no idea.  You need chocolate that bad  that you've got to gnaw on a chocolate penis?  No.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  We've got some malted milk balls over here 
[01:03:30]  and a molded sack if you want to.  Now he's got two more in front of him.  And now he's asking if we wanted to take him home.  Right.  Because they were both sitting here still wrapping.  And you guys still wanted to take him home.  Of course they're sitting there.  Oh, yeah.  Like we said before.  Look how he's trying to inhale us.  Now, this show's not about lying.  I mean, we put our foot in our mouth from time to time  and then the person gets hammered.  Foot would be a good thing right now for Rick.  But we don't, like, openly lie to try to get the guy.  Okay.  The fact is, you're eating the chocolate penis  and you've got two more in front of you 
[01:04:00]  and you're offering them pot.  Oh, I just can't fill enough of myself with this.  And then he goes, he goes,  well, you know, don't you want to bring him home?  And we're like, no, we don't want to get caught with it.  Imagine we have the chocolate penises in the car  and we're in a little fender bender or a car crash  and all of a sudden they'd find it for chocolate penises.  And you're knocked out and the emergency crew,  the jaws of life open up the door  and out rolls a chocolate penis.  Chocolate all over your face?  You think you're going to get the type of medical care you need  when they're laughing? 
[01:04:30]  Just not happening.  The chocolate penis is not coming home with me.  No.  So what did you start at the base?  How did you eat it, Rick?  Did you just lick it or bite it?  How many inches did you get in your mouth at one time?  It's all veiny.  How are you eating that?  Are you insane?  You don't eat that if you're a guy?  You're a mad man. 
[01:05:00]  It's so wrong.  You're a chocolate almost.  You're a chocolate almost.  How do you walk around with that in your head?  Eating it.  Oh, man.  Could you put the chocolate penis on its side at least?  Like it's straight up in front of your mouth.  What is going on here?  In front of my mouth.  This angle looks like it.  Don't touch it. 
[01:05:30]  What?  Oh, okay.  You sit there and you go,  can you turn the penis over or lay it down?  Well, don't touch it.  Get a broom and sweep it off the counter.  You don't grab it.  I just would never think of walking around eating the chocolate penis.  All right?  Correct.  There's no problem there.  He's got an inch left.  I'm just going to take a little crack off of my chocolate vagina here. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  Look, it's tasty.  Wait.  Now, what does that smell like?  Trout.  Very good.  What is this?  Oh, yeah.  I bet you like it, Rick.  We've got to thank the five people at Sin Chocolates.  Sin Full Chocolates.  Sin Full Chocolates for giving us a bit today.  Everyone's coming in to look at Rick gnawing as he's chocolate penis.  You're becoming an attraction around here, Rick. 
[01:06:30]  They want to see how he eats it.  Like the girls are coming in saying,  let me see you eat it.  Like they're getting all hot.  Look at this.  I'm thinking of Rick.  No, that looks better in my mouth.  I don't know if we're allowed to mention her by name,  but she's got the chocolate penis in her hand,  and she wants Rick to take it.  No.  Show how you eat it, Rick.  Yeah.  All them women are coming in.  They want to see this.  Come on.  Don't do the water.  Turn on, please.  Put that in my mouth.  I heard you.  Oh, what's the difference?  You're putting that part in your mouth? 
[01:07:00]  You've been eating it.  You've been eating one already.  What's the matter?  You're full?  Oh, he's grabbing it.  Yeah, look.  He's got it in his hand.  You want me to unwrap it?  Oh, unwrap it?  Unsafe sex.  Ooh.  Unwrap it in the hand.  Yeah.  All right.  Susie's unwrapping the chocolate penis for Rick.  Oh, my God.  This is just not right, man. 
[01:07:30]  Is she going to feed it to him?  Oh, yeah.  She's going to strap it up.  That's it.  All right.  She's got the chocolate penis out of the...  Well, take it out of the entire wrapper.  Yeah.  That would be disgusting if you ate it with the wrapper on it.  Rick, there's no way you're going to put it in your mouth like that.  He's dangling it in front of his face.  And he gave it this look like he was ready to hop it. 
[01:08:00]  I did not.  And then he just was like...  You turned away.  No, I didn't.  Come on.  Take a look.  Come on.  A beautiful woman...  A beautiful woman is feeding you her chocolate penis.  Even though I know it's fake, it's still like a bad, bad dream.  But you were eating one earlier.  I'm eating a broken-off piece of one.  No.  It doesn't look like anything.  Rick, once you eat one... 
[01:08:30]  You've already made the step.  You're out of the chocolate closet.  You're gnawing on the other one.  Just put that in your mouth.  No, no, no.  I can't do it.  Can't do it.  Just a little lick.  No, not a little lick.  Just a little lick, she does.  Come on.  Just lick the base.  Come on.  If you bite the tip off, you'll get to the creamy filling. 
[01:09:00]  You guys living vicariously through me or something?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm doing.  Come on.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  Just looking at it, I can't do it.  Yeah.  What do you call that nub that's in front of you?  That's the last one.  That's just like a big Hershey kiss.  She's chewed it down like a beaver would.  Oh, she's going to share it.  She's going to share it with you, Rick.  Do you have the double dong chocolate over there?  Speaking of double dong, here's Roger. 
[01:09:30]  Roger, would you like to partake in the chocolate penis with Rick?  No, I'd rather.  Look at the threesome.  Come on, Rick.  For the team, man.  Oh.  For the team, there's some freaking wrong, man.  I don't know how I can do that.  You already were gnawing on one.  If that was anything else, if it was the same chocolate molded into the shape of a boob,  you would bite the nip off if he was holding it.  But, dude, this doesn't even look like a penis, okay? 
[01:10:00]  It.  All right, just lick a little of the.  She's holding it.  Come on.  Come on.  Are there any cameras here?  Come on, Rick, you fag.  I'm not a fag.  Oh, you're an idiot.  Hey, no, I'm not going to.  You're not an idiot, dude.  We almost had him putting the chocolate penis in the house.  I had to say that.  It was in fun.  We were going to call you a piece of chocolate.  If you can't, come on.  Everyone is coming in the studio.  They want to see, you know, the girl is feeding it to you. 
[01:10:30]  It's not like it's a guy.  Yeah, if it was a guy feeding it, then, you know, that's like, just shut your eyes.  Shut your eyes and make believe it's something else.  And make believe it's a pudding pop.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a jello pudding pop.  Make believe the cows are feeding you a jello pudding pop.  All right.  Go on, Rick.  No? 
[01:11:00]  Hey, he's ready.  He's ready to put it in his mouth.  Oh, my gosh.  He's feeding it.  It's like he's holding a gun to his head.  It looks like the scrotum dude from the cigarette ads.  Joe Camel.  Joe Camel.  The big Joe Camel looking thing.  All right.  Come on, I don't think he's a...  We'll give you a Kit Kat if you're good.  I honestly don't think I can do it.  Just lean over and take a bite. 
[01:11:30]  It's like a bad dream.  She's holding it there for you.  And when she thinks it's sexy, you're going to get my...  Hi, N.E.W.  N.E.W., what are you guys talking about?  I was raking that chocolate thing.  Yeah, it's pretty funny, man.  Is he still not eating that?  No, he's...  Well, he ate one.  We want to see him eat another one.  Oh, come on.  You've got to post pictures of that on the internet.  You got your camera?  At least get a picture of Rick and the chocolate tea  you're seeing held in front of his face.  You're going to get a good shot of that from there, Rick? 
[01:12:00]  Oh, what did he just eat?  Nothing.  Oh.  Yeah, you're eating that little nub that you had left.  Yeah, the little piece of chocolate.  No, let's...  Look at the vein on it, idiot.  So what's the difference between that one and that one?  You're just eating the base of the other one  just because the rest of it's gone in your stomach already.  Oh, my God.  You see, this just looks like a big hunk of chocolate.  Okay?  Yeah, you.  Just like it.  I guess that's how you rationalize it in prison, too.  Just like a big hunk of chocolate. 
[01:12:30]  That's all I'll imagine it as.  A big hunk of chocolate.  Are you going to do it?  Now there's ten people in the studio.  Yeah, see, there's too many people now.  Everyone's waiting.  Come on.  Everyone's waiting to see Rick's technique.  Look at Ben.  Ben's like, I want to do it.  Come on, Rick.  Deal.  We've got to take a break here.  Come on.  Come on.  Do you see the way he leers at it as it comes towards him?  He's like David King. 
[01:13:00]  He's looking at it like, should I?  It's so easy.  It's so easy.  As she's getting it towards you,  she just touches your neck with it.  As it's coming towards you,  just open up and take a bite.  Come on.  It's getting soft.  Well, it's not.  It's melting under the lights.  It's melting under the lights. 
[01:13:30]  That's right, man.  See, then I'm going to have nightmares of Earl.  I don't need this.  Come on.  You let everyone down.  You really did.  Come on.  If you did it right away,  it wouldn't even be a big deal right now.  Just close your eyes.  Now it's built up into something.  Close your eyes.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  She'll do all the work.  Bite it.  She'll do all the work.  Bite it.  If you bite it, it won't be as low-ish.  His eyes are closed.  Low-ish.  Just bite it.  His eyes are closed.  All right.  His mouth is open.  She's guiding it towards the mouth. 
[01:14:00]  The second you feel it on your teeth,  just bite down.  Bite down.  And your penance will be over.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  You're a T.  You C.T.  That's a chocolate.  All right.  Yeah.  Chocolate teeth. 
[01:14:30]  All right.  Ew.  All right.  His eyes are closed.  He's not opening.  All right.  Ready?  Bite.  Bite.  Bite.  Bite.  Bite.  It's good enough, man.  It's good enough, man.  That was disturbing to look at, man.  Oh, my God.  I can't breathe.  That is so freaking funny. 
[01:15:00]  Come on.  That looked like you'd done it before.  Oh, come on.  See the way his eyes rolled back like?  Rolled back like a shark.  His eyes rolled back, White.  Likes his eyes like a doll's eyes.  Do you just hear that horrible high bitch screaming and hollering?  All right.  And thank you, Rick.  You chocolate sucker.  Okay.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:15:30]  You will never see a more wretched hive of gum and villainy.  One-oh-two-seven.  One-oh-two-seven.  W-N-E-W.  Let's talk about the millionaire.  The millionaire.  Who wants to marry a whore?  You know, I am very disappointed in Fox.  Yeah.  That's where I go for, you know, the sensational TV.  We've all seen the shows.  And now they do Who Wants to Marry a Whore?  World's scariest police chase is five. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  Things like that.  All those fun programs.  And then they come up with Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?  Yeah.  And it turns out the guy had a restraining order against them.  Oops.  Might not even be a millionaire at this point.  He lives in, like, this little house.  He lives in a crappy house.  In San Diego somewhere.  Trust me, I'm nowhere near a millionaire.  And I live in a better house than he does.  Than this millionaire guy.  I think most of us do.  They showed the house on Dateline last night.  I'm like, that's not where a millionaire lives. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  So it turns out somebody dug up some documents on him.  God, you've got to love the Internet, man.  Like, years ago, this stuff didn't happen.  But it was on thesmokinggun.com.  That's a great website.  You go there and find all kinds of dirt on people.  They've got documents and court papers and all kinds of stuff there.  And they turned up a restraining order that this guy's ex-fiancee filed against him for pushing her around and smacking her and saying he was going to kill her.  Well, the quote from the restraining order, I've got it right in front of me here. 
[01:17:00]  Rockwell threw me around and slapped and hit me in the face.  Recently, he said he would find me and kill me.  Come on!  Many times during sex, he attempted to become physically and verbally abusive.  Yeah.  His temper is short and he will randomly throw anything in his path.  You like it, you bitch.  Don't you?  I see nothing wrong with that.  Ah, Mike Tyson.  I see absolutely nothing wrong with that way he treats his horse. 
[01:17:30]  You've got to knock him around a little bit.  Yeah.  What do all abused women have in common?  Ah, what, Mike?  They don't effing listen.  Listen to Iron Mike.  Just ask that bitch Robin Gibbons.  I gave her a couple.  Hey, could you turn down Iron Mike's punches?  What?  Because they hurt my ears.  A little hungover, Mike?  Yeah.  Mike went to the detail party.  There were some bitchy whores down there last night. 
[01:18:00]  Little squawning model types.  The waist.  Yeah.  What a bunch of glass jaws on those whores.  I gave one a punch to the uterus.  Right in her camel toe.  It split her right in the head.  Oh, come on.  She busted wide open.  I hate whores that can't take a punch.  Are you going to be the next person to do who wants to marry an abusive millionaire?  I am indeed a millionaire.  Yeah.  I made a lot of money.  Yeah.  Boxing.  Yeah.  And I want to do the show. 
[01:18:30]  I want to go on there and marry a whore.  Now, how would you pick your future bride live on TV there?  How many do you get to choose from?  A hell of a lot.  Like 50 or so.  50 disgusting whores.  I like that.  So I go down the line.  And the first thing I'll do is like nail it with a few body blows.  See if they can take some punches to the gut.  You dirty shit.  Shut up. 
[01:19:00]  And how would you determine after you hit them a few times?  Which one would be?  Well, they'd all fall down.  So the ones that fall down a little slower.  Yeah.  Those are the ones I would choose for finalists.  Okay.  And then they go to the Iron Mike Tyson motel room for a little alleged rape.  That's why I pin them down and I bang them against their will.  But it's just allegedly. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Remember that.  Of course.  Keep Opie and Anthony out of trouble.  Allegedly.  How do you spell allegedly?  E.  No, that's not E.  M.  A.  A.  A.  I owe you.  Who cares?  I just spell it.  All right.  I know he's open-ended and they don't get sued by a big goddamn boxing maniac. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  Then I would, okay, then I have that.  Yeah.  And the way I choose finalists from that.  Yeah, now you got, let's say you got the ten finalists on stage.  Who can accept Iron Mike for anal?  That would narrow it down pretty quickly.  I swear, wait, you ain't seen nothing until you've seen Iron Mike's Louisiana Black Snake.  It's got a mind of its own.  It raves women. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Thank God I keep saying that.  Shut up, you whore.  Oh, she's out.  She's out of the competition.  You see how easy it is?  Come here, I grab this one by the throat.  She's right down.  How am I supposed to have fun with a whore like that?  She can't take a punch.  Look at her bleed.  And then for the final one, when I get down to the final three, I bite each one of their ears off. 
[01:21:00]  And then the one that still has the most blood in their body is the one I take home to be my bride.  My bride, Mrs. Iron Mike, filthy whore.  On the next episode of Who Wants to Marry an Abusive Millionaire, right? 
[01:21:30]  Who Wants to Marry an Abusive Millionaire.  And then you know what we do for Honeymore?  I grab her and I climb the Empire State Building and swat at biplanes until they shoot me down.  Plus, beauty killed the beast.  Allegedly.  Either that or I hit on the head with a space shovel and bury her in the backyard with other dirty girls.  You're a dirty girl. 
[01:22:00]  Allegedly.  Very nice.  Fuck me on the show.  All right.  Whore.  Iron Mike, I'm the next Who Wants to Marry an Abusive Millionaire.  Just like Rick Rockwell.  Oh, my God.  Goddamn.  Damn.  Let's go to the phones.  Everyone has comments about this stupid show.  Ronnie, what's up?  I got to tell you, man.  Fox crossed the frigging line with this show. 
[01:22:30]  I actually threw a pot at my wife.  I threw a pot.  I went under the sink, threw a frigging pot at her.  I said, I cannot believe this thing is on television.  Yeah.  I cannot believe it.  Well, they always cross the line.  That's why I'm pissed off at Fox.  They should be re-running that show now.  And they're like, oh, we should be running.  It's so off being perverted.  I know Rick Rockwell.  I don't want to say after that, that he's a psychopath.  I want to know who looked this guy's history up.  Helen Keller?  You can't figure this out?  That this guy's a lunatic?  Screw his history. 
[01:23:00]  I don't understand why we're not, you know, digging up his backyard as we speak.  He's probably got some bodies back there.  He's got some bones back there.  You never know.  Allegedly.  You got to listen to projects out here, for Christ's sake.  What kind of millionaire?  He's fixing his own plumbing.  Yeah, how many millionaires live in the project?  That's a good point.  I mean, what's up with that?  He's not a rap artist.  Forget it.  I mean, Fox has such mud on this.  And I'm glad they do, because they're putting most dangerous headaches on,  and most biggest periods women have, and most fantastic bike rides, 
[01:23:30]  whatever the hell people watch.  Now they're putting this crap on to boost.  He's out of control.  That millionaire was a pussy, too.  I swear to God, I saw the interview with him,  and they didn't even have sex on their honeymoon.  They went, where would, where'd they go on a cruise?  They went on a cruise, had separate drinks.  I said a cruise.  We got a cruise, right.  See, he would be able to keep that girl if he worked the honeymoon like I and Mike Tyson works it.  Yeah, how do you work it?  Well, some delicate moonlighting in the suite. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  In their little cabin on the cruise ship.  A bottle of champagne, maybe?  A bottle of champagne.  Oh, yeah.  Nice, easy music.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe like Marvin Gaye.  Uh-huh.  Nice, easy music.  And then maybe she wears some lingerie.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe some body oils and stuff?  Yeah, body oils.  Yeah.  And all loosened up.  Nice, a couple of juices.  And then I swung up.  Just swung.  And I very fast.  Work the hand puppet.  Put on a little show. 
[01:24:30]  I push her in the uterus.  I whisper sweet nothings in her ear as I bite it off.  Shut up!  Oh!  Oh, I'm completely alleged.  Allegedly?  Allegedly.  Okay.  Let's go to Dan.  Dan, you're next on N.E.W.  What's up, ONA?  How are you?  I got the name for the next Fox special.  What?  When Millionaires Attack.  That would be pretty good. 
[01:25:00]  That's very good.  When Billionaires Attack on Fox.  Very good.  Brought to you with the cooperation of the men and women that are psychopaths.  Telling you that guy is a psycho.  Yeah.  Dig up his yard now.  What are we waiting for?  I don't know who sat down and talked to the guy.  Like, they must have interviewed him.  I mean, they had to sit down with the producers, right?  Three words out of this guy's mouth, you'd be going, oh, oh, no.  We booked the lunatic.  Right?  Oh, no. 
[01:25:30]  This guy is completely insane.  Yeah.  He's certifiable.  Well, we got some clips of Rockwell.  On this clip, it's worth playing.  Rockwell compares marriage to computers, to buying a computer.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to sound like a harsh analogy.  But have you ever heard someone talk about buying a computer?  You say you buy a computer, you check them out, you find all the features you want,  and then you make the best decision you can based on the amount of money you have to spend 
[01:26:00]  and the information you have at the time.  Uh-huh.  Here's Rockwell in his sprawling shack.  Working off the old sperm bank.  He just met on television.  Let's look at his house.  What's that in the crawl space?  Dead bodies. 
[01:26:30]  As Rockwell drives in the luxury of his Dodge Dodge.  It's a 1972 Dodge Dodge.  Wonderful.  Let's look at the master bedroom.  What's that smell?  There's a body under the bed.  He's dressed for the nines.  In his Wrangler jeans. 
[01:27:00]  And Puma sneakers.  Let's go to the luxurious backyard.  Where he can fit up to two Weber grills.  Lifestyles of the rich and abusive.  What a tool.  All right.  Let's open his closet and see his collection of concert t-shirts.  That's not a brainer.  Why did the rush one always shrink? 
[01:27:30]  They did have the cheapest concert t-shirts.  God damn.  It was a midriff top.  That's a great obscure reference right there.  Gabe from Queens on the Instant Feedback app.  They ought to make those pseudo reality shows really interesting.  Something like, who wants to marry for a green card?  With 50 illegals trying out for an American bachelor.  After you get a winner, you let loose the INS agent after the other 49.  You watch them scatter like roaches in the light. 
[01:28:00]  Now there's a show for Fox.  Come on.  That's great.  That is a good one.  That's Gabe from Queens.  Very good.  Get our best stuff from you, effers.  Look at all the wife be the t-shirts.  How appropriate.  TK from Long Island on the Instant Feedback.  On BET or the WB, they should have, who wants to marry a welfare assistant?  Holy shit.  Wait a minute.  It's the inappropriate gong. 
[01:28:30]  Who wants to marry a welfare recipient?  You'll win a life supply of government cheese.  And food stamps amounting in the tens of dollars.  You'll be whisked away in a 62 Cadillac.  You'll be giving a shopping cart full of depositable bottles.  And a snorkel jacket. 
[01:29:00]  Let's look at our contestants.  Oh, look, it's Biggie.  All right.  Oh, boy.  We'll take a quick break here.  Who wants to marry a millionaire?  Kid touch her.  All right.  Stay there.  Opie.  I'll be honest.  I'm a big pussy.  And Anthony.  I'm an ass.  What can I say?  Could you please get those two sharks out of here? 
[01:29:30]  1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's our show.  This is it.  This is what you get.  212-757-1027.  It's WNEW.  I'm very excited, Anthony, that I got that laser eye surgery.  This is my commercial.  Don't worry.  Because I'm going to be very happy to see what is about to walk through that studio door.  Yeah.  God, look at all the salespeople.  All the salespeople are kind of camping out outside the studio door. 
[01:30:00]  They want to see this, huh?  Look at everyone coming around.  Well, we've got to welcome Crystal Storm to the show.  Yeah.  She's 122 inches around up top there.  Oh, my God.  And this comes, wow.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  Look at the sun.  My God.  Those are huge.  And she's good looking.  Yeah.  Usually they're messes.  I mean, no offense.  Obviously, you're a dancer. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  I mean, you wouldn't just, like, all of a sudden have boobs like that if you weren't dancing.  Well, you never know.  I don't know.  They seem like they might be inconvenient for other jobs, you know?  Yeah, that's true.  How many guys talk to your eyes?  Oh, not too many.  Not too many, huh?  I got this board in the way, so I think I'm going to be the first guy to talk to your eyes.  Oh, cool.  I'll just stare at her boobs.  I won't know what to do then.  Like, normally I would be embarrassed or something.  If there's just a girl on the street and she's got big or very nice boobs and I'm looking at them, I try not to. 
[01:31:00]  You know, you look up at the eye.  But since you went through the time and expense of getting boobs that big and you're a dancer and you like guys looking at your boobs,  I'll just stare at your boobs.  I won't even look at your eyes.  Okay, that's fine.  Okay.  Hank, we should share a moment with our new boss because he's, like, peeking outside the studio door.  All right.  Oh, I see him out there.  Rick, let's start Ken in.  Our new boss, Ken Stevens.  Hey, I was just getting coffee.  Hey, man.  All right, Ken.  Grab that mic real fast.  Our new boss in the studio, Ken Stevens.  We haven't had him on the radio yet. 
[01:31:30]  It took big boobs, Ken, to get you to the studio.  No, I swear it was a coincidence.  You don't believe that at all.  No, I don't, man.  How many times have we seen Ken outside the studio in the last, how long have you been here now?  Two months?  I did one.  Three months?  I've actually never been here before.  Maybe once.  Yeah, I don't even think he's been in here while we've been on the air.  It's a very nice studio.  Isn't it?  Yeah, very nice.  He's got a cup of coffee in his hand, covering all his bases, but he's like peeking in the  studio door.  I figured we'd let him in.  Yeah, that coffee machine's empty out there.  Everybody's using it as the excuse.  I need coffee. 
[01:32:00]  I'll admit I was looking in the window.  Yeah.  Well, you know, you never, how often do you get to see a rest that big?  You're absolutely right.  And they are how big?  They're 121 XXX.  XXX?  Yeah.  XXX.  Oh, my God.  Those are very big.  We've got to get some pictures for the unofficial website.  Yes.  I don't get a picture.  Yeah.  Let's get the really good picture.  Let's get the real picture.  Oh, my God.  She's like...  Holy!  You know, that's unbelievable.  That's like pretty good. 
[01:32:30]  The bra is stretched to its limits.  Look at how huge that bra is.  You know what each cup looks like?  Remember the old crash helmets they used to wear at the Indy 500?  Or the old football helmets back in the old days when the gift played?  Right, the leather helmets.  That's what they look like.  And there's like two bowling balls in there.  And look at the thing, the lacing that holds the cups together.  I've seen that on the Verrazano Bridge.  It like holds the roadway up to the cables.  Yeah, there's a little stress there. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, my God.  That is unbelievable.  And she's got a tiny little waist.  Yeah, she's got a really little waist.  Little waist, blonde hair.  Cute butt.  Like, what is that?  Like a little Spanish outfit you're wearing.  Yeah.  Like a little Zorro outfit or something.  Yeah.  Boo ball.  Look at you.  And the sides of the pants are all cut out open.  If you haven't noticed, yes, she has legs.  And not many people looking at those.  And you kind of feel bad that it takes away from the rest of you because you're an attractive 
[01:33:30]  girl and everything.  And you've got these huge boobs that everyone just focuses.  It's like, why bother putting makeup on?  I mean, Gary.  Really, you can look like Ernest Borgnine.  It's just like, okay, look.  But you do very well, I guess, dancing, huh?  Actually, it's a lot of fun.  I get to travel all over the country.  Yeah.  And New York City is one of my favorite stops.  I come here probably about four or five times a year.  Where are you from?  I'm from Florida.  Oh, Florida.  From beautiful.  What part of Florida?  Fort Lauderdale.  Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  Let's bring to the main stage right about now. 
[01:34:00]  A woman with huge breasts.  I don't even know the name, but we need some white snakes.  Oh, yeah, you like dancing to the 80s hairband music?  There you go.  Yeah, is that what you do?  Yeah?  Hell, yeah.  That's what they do in Atlanta and Florida.  And that's all different kinds of music.  You ever get any, like, pole wounds on those things when you're swinging around the pole?  Oh, I wouldn't sit around the pole with these.  Really?  You could probably do, like, a pole thing where you put the pole in between them.  Right.  You ought to try that.  Lose the pole.  And you want to just lose the pole in there.  And you want to do the real. 
[01:34:30]  You want to do the real intro for her?  Her name's Crystal Storm, 122-inch breast.  Here we go.  Ready?  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, let's bring it to the main stage right now for a beautiful form,  Waterdale Blonde, a Crystal Storm.  Sporting a 22-inch breast.  Let's give her a big hi to make her feel welcome tonight.  They all sound like that, don't they?  Yes.  Isn't that stupid?  They all sound like they belong over at K-Roc.  Hi, I'm not going to do a bit of rock block. 
[01:35:00]  And a 22-inch bull.  Yeah, that's something.  Goddamn.  Do you do any breast tricks?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, what do you know?  Can you do a breast trick for us?  Okay.  Which one can you do?  Um, I need a volunteer.  Uh, look at all the hands going up.  Jesus Christ.  Get Spaz.  He's been working his ass off.  Okay, but I got to unleash the girls for this one.  That's fine.  Oh, damn.  What a shame.  If anyone has a question for, uh, Crystal Storm and a breast.  212-757-1037. 
[01:35:30]  Uh, Spaz.  Here's Spaz.  I can't do it.  I can't.  Shut up.  Shut up, your girlfriend.  Shut up.  We used to get you laid.  Just shut up.  This guy has had sex with more of our listeners.  You're a jerk dog.  Now that he has a girlfriend, he doesn't want to participate?  No, it's going to be Spaz.  Okay, Spaz.  You're not going to have sex with her, Spaz.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  You just unleashed him, Anthony.  All right.  I'm looking.  Holy mother of pearl. 
[01:36:00]  That's got to be difficult to live with.  There's got to be some drawbacks to having two human heads.  I mean, look.  You know what they look like, to tell you the truth?  You ever see the Star Trek episode with the big asshead alien?  The first one, I believe it was called the Menagerie.  Sure.  With Captain Christopher Pike.  Yeah.  Her boobs look like the alien head.  Wow.  They're attractive, though.  I mean, I've seen the big breasts and girls, and, yeah. 
[01:36:30]  I mean, that's a turn on.  This is the first one that's a turn on.  Very big.  Very nice.  All right.  Are we ready for the breast trick?  All right.  Spaz.  I want to explain what's going on.  Waterparks.  Spaz now on his knees.  Oh, facing away.  Okay, a little bit lower.  Okay, ready?  Now she's putting the boobs.  Oh, wait, wait.  The boobs are in front of his eyes.  He's, like, blinded.  Oh, thanks.  He's got boob eyes.  Wow.  Can you hold anything under those?  Sure.  What do you hold?  Like, what's the biggest thing you've ever held under your boobs? 
[01:37:00]  Can you hold the magic eight ball?  That's easy.  She needs something more than that.  Wow.  Yeah, that's nothing.  No, we've got to find something.  Oh, my God.  Hey, what size were you before you had those put in?  I was a 65 triple F.  What?  Yeah.  So they were big anyway.  Yeah, they were pretty big.  You could tell by a nip size, Opie.  Because I don't think those would be on, like, A cups.  No.  No.  To tell you the truth.  And then what made you decide to go up to that size?  Well, gravity.  Really?  It started maybe sagging a little bit because you had boobs. 
[01:37:30]  When did you develop?  How old were you?  I was about 10.  About 10?  And you started getting boobs?  I was a decap.  Thank God 10-year-old boys aren't that teasing or anything in school.  You probably didn't have much of a problem at 10 with the boys teasing you.  So I just had my extra skin filled up and I had them lifted.  Lifted?  So they're nice and high.  With, like, a come-along?  That would be how they lift those.  Wow.  Look at that.  I can't.  I'm sorry.  I can't take my eyes off. 
[01:38:00]  They look natural.  I'm just looking.  In a bizarre way, they look natural.  They're nice and firm up top.  Natural on Jupiter?  What is that natural, Opie?  What are you, insane?  Actually, most of it are natural.  My supports are at the bottom.  Your supports?  Yep.  You're talking about them like it's the new building going up in Times Square.  Almost.  All right, let's talk to a few guys.  They're freaking out here.  Stan, what's up?  Hey, I was just calling from Queens saying I could see her left boob right from my apartment, man.  Yeah.  I was going to climb on top of it.  All right, Stan. 
[01:38:30]  Wow.  Thank you.  I'm stunned.  You ever do movies or anything?  I have four movies.  You have four movies?  Mm-hmm.  What, like Disney?  Yeah.  With the Seven Dwarfs.  Yeah, really?  No, you've done some porno?  Yeah.  Yeah?  A couple of them.  What kind?  Like, what are the titles?  Breathful Fantasies.  Yeah?  I figured they'd be focusing on your assets there.  Okay, Unexpected Entry.  Oh.  Very nice.  Well, I bet that involves the back door.  The leather Cheerios.  Does it?  The burglar. 
[01:39:00]  The burglar.  Wait, wait.  Is that when you're in bed and a burglar comes in?  Something like that.  And he's like, oh, my God, I broke into the house with the girl with the huge boobs.  This is great.  I won't even take the TV.  Crystal Storm in our studio.  She's got a website, www.crystalstorm.com.  Wow.  Hey, Tim, what's going on?  I'm a fresh man myself.  I like to know how big our nipples are, man.  They must feel like pancakes, those things.  I've got to tell you, they're pretty big.  I'm looking at the top of a... 
[01:39:30]  What's about the size of a coffee cup?  Yeah, more like the big cup at McDonald's when you get the super size.  Who made it a bra?  Coleman?  Didier.  Didier.  Didier.  Didier do some jumping jacks for us?  Oh, no, no.  That would probably really hurt.  I'd probably give myself a black eye and all of you guys, too.  Yeah.  All at the same time.  That would probably hurt.  But there's some drawbacks, you know.  It's very hard to sleep, but I kind of solved that problem.  Yeah.  What are you sleeping?  How do you sleep?  I had a custom mattress made where they cut holes in the mattress. 
[01:40:00]  Get out of here.  Really?  So you got little pockets for your boobs to go into?  Yeah.  Wow.  You never see that on any commercial.  Yeah.  We have to travel with the mattress, though.  That's kind of a pain.  Really?  Yeah.  That's funny.  You just take the saws all out and cut a couple of holes in there?  That's just good to go.  Walter, what's up?  Yeah.  How are you doing?  I just wanted to know if she floats like a pontoon boat.  Yeah.  You ever go swimming in the summer? 
[01:40:30]  I didn't see your wife, but the last time I was at the beach, I saw this one girl.  She was floating like a pontoon boat, so I just decided to run out there and try to rescue  her and just float on top of her.  No.  Actually, when I swim, I sink.  Oh, really?  It's really, really scary.  They're like weight?  Yeah.  They weigh 20 pounds a piece.  Oh, 20 pounds a piece.  40 pounds a piece.  And they're not buoyant weight, I guess, huh?  No, they're not.  They do sink.  How much do you weigh overall?  I'm about 145 pounds.  Yeah, because she's really small besides her boobs. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  So what is that, silicone?  I know.  What's saline?  Saline supports.  Isn't that salt water?  Shouldn't that float?  Or just be neutral buoyancy?  I don't know.  It should be, I guess.  I don't know.  They need some ballast tanks in there or something.  It doesn't work that way.  AJ wants to comment about your website, which is crystalstorm.com.  AJ.  I want to know what he said.  All right.  Holy cow.  It's nuts.  It's nuts.  And I want to ask your question.  What's the story with the lion?  Oh, Elvis?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I used to do stage shows with Elvis. 
[01:41:30]  I used to take him around and we'd do shows at the club.  And until he was about, I'd say, about 500 pounds.  And then he started getting too big for the stages.  And now he's in Las Vegas doing shows.  Can you lift him up with your breasts, too?  No.  No.  What's Elvis?  A tiger or something?  He's an African lion.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's kind of a pet for me.  Uh-huh.  Hmm.  Very cool.  He's real cool.  All right, AJ.  All right.  A lot of people have questions here.  We got out, like, sex with guys and stuff.  They really enjoy that? 
[01:42:00]  Uh-huh.  Sex with guys and stuff.  You know, they really enjoy those big ones like that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  It probably takes away from ground zero, though, you know.  They probably want to just do things to your boobs.  Sometimes.  Has there been one?  Tell me honestly.  Has there been one guy that didn't want to do the TF?  No.  Yeah.  See?  Of course.  Like, who wouldn't want?  Oh, I just asked her.  There hasn't been one guy that she's left with that hasn't wanted to give her the TF.  I mean, you wouldn't go. 
[01:42:30]  It's like going to Disney and not going on Space Mountain.  You know?  You'd have to.  Chuck Radio.  Wow.  Hey, Crystal, I was wondering, can you perform 69?  Um, yeah.  I got this fish and, uh, you know, you're on your back and my seat would be five feet  in the air.  Like an inclined plane, you know?  Blueboard ramp.  That depends on how big your belly is, too. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Because that could be a problem.  I see.  Can I sit between or what?  Can I get between those two?  You see?  Every guy would just want the TF.  Thank God.  Thank you, Benny.  That sounds like he's in love with Crystal.  Tom, what's up?  Yeah, I think he's in love.  I think he, I never heard of him so much.  I think he's trying to hook up.  I mean, I think it's, uh, the coffee that I, uh, I've been drinking.  I don't know.  I'm like, I'm, I'm, I'm all wired.  I think he's in love in his eyes.  Really?  Like, go.  Well, I gotta tell, I gotta tell you, Tom.  She hasn't stopped. 
[01:43:30]  He's like a chatterbox.  She's, she's a cute girl.  A lot of these big-breasted women, they're kind of, you know, no offense, Crystal, but  they're slobby, you know?  But she's, she's very attractive.  Well, let's take care of that.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Got it.  Yeah, that, that'll be great, as they call her as a witness in my divorce.  So, Anthony, uh, yeah, who you been seeing?  Oh, great, yeah.  A girl with a hundred and twenty-two inch breast.  That's great. 
[01:44:00]  Thank you, Tom.  No, I'm talking a lot, because, uh, Tom, it's radio.  What are we supposed to do?  Just sit here and go, uh, uh, uh, uh, Joyce, what's going on?  Hi, I have a question for Crystal.  Okay.  I am married to a boob-loving guy.  Okay.  And he's, you know, I'm a B now, and I'm interested in becoming a double D.  Right.  So, do you find, I mean, was your inspiration, is this, are you naturally larger, and then  you went larger by surgery, or did you have a picture in mind of, this is how large I want 
[01:44:30]  to go, and, um, I'm going to use this as an act, and I'm going to make myself known that  way?  Right.  Well, actually, um, I was pretty large.  I was a triple F cut before I started, and I went into...  Holy magilla.  Okay.  I went into the doctor and I asked for a reduction, and the doctor said, how old are you?  Well, I was 18, and he said, you are too young to get a reduction, because there's a lot of  scars to the reduction.  Really?  Really.  So, he said, let me, let me just fill you up and lift him up higher, and your back won't  hurt anymore. 
[01:45:00]  You know, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You go in...  You go in...  You go in...  With, with, um, carrying that much weight up front?  Well, it's the way it's distributed, actually.  Oh.  I want to know the doctor that you enter that you won't go in, you're 18 years old, you want  a reduction, because you're so big, and he goes, no, let me pump them up bigger, and lift  them up higher.  I want to do.  My God, I won't do a reduction.  That would be unethical.  Let me pop some frigging cassava melons in here.  My God.  I'd like to be a double D. I'm always self-conscious about being small. 
[01:45:30]  I wanted to see what you thought.  Being you were bigger already, and you went bigger, how about somebody smaller going bigger?  Can I recommend something?  Go to Toys R Us.  They're two hoppity hops.  You ever see those things?  And just slam those in there.  Your husband will love you.  I know.  Bounce around the house.  Lori has a question for you.  Lori!  I'd like to know, if you had a special mattress made?  Uh-huh.  What kind of sheets do you use?  Oh, she got those at Bed, Boobs, and Beyond. 
[01:46:00]  It's amazing.  Like it or not, this will be the most popular radio show in New York City.  The only show beats the hell out of my dad's little porno.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1027 is our phone number.  My brothers were supposed to call in today, Anthony, to help me out with that story from yesterday.  Oh, your horror story? 
[01:46:30]  The family vacation when I was 11.  We figured out it.  I was 11.  Did you bring nice cement bags full of sugar and margarine sandwiches, Opie?  We had to pack our little clothes and cement bags up.  Quickly, Joe Onelegs, I'm fairly checking in.  He says, I joined the Marine Corps because I got tired of pumping gas.  I told him I wanted to fly jets.  So I took the test.  They promised the air wings.  I got the air wings.  Pumping gas into jets.  No. 
[01:47:00]  Son of a...  That's funny.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, can I tell the story again really fast?  Yes.  Basically, yeah, I was from a big family.  Didn't have a lot of money to go around.  So when Dad said he's going to load up the truck, or actually the Volkswagen bus.  Volkswagen bus?  We had a Volkswagen bus.  Oh, God.  And they took the seats out so they could fit more kids in there.  The family truckster.  It was the family truckster.  Dude, the Volkswagen bus. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  If you had that, it was like...  No, any time on the road you pass that,  it was never anyone normal-looking driving them.  They were all hippies.  Like, anyone you looked at driving a Volkswagen bus was either a hippie or some complete deranged  serial killer looking dude.  Well, they didn't have the SUVs and the minivans.  So, yeah.  If you saw one of those on the highway, it was two things.  A family with a lot of kids, like my family, or someone going to a dead show.  The thing is, the family with a lot of kids usually had the station wagon. 
[01:48:00]  And the Volkswagen minibus was reserved for real, like, lunatics and hippies.  Well, you've met my family, wouldn't you know?  Okay.  Throw your own conclusion.  Well, they ain't hippies.  My friend.  No, they're a thing.  Yeah, well, I have seven kids.  You can't fit seven kids in the Volkswagen.  You can get them in the station wagon.  I'm in the station wagon?  No, you can't.  No, not really.  Oh, yeah.  You put the youngest one in that seat that faces backwards so they can pick their nose  and wave to the people.  And someone on the hump.  So the story goes, my brother Elmo is already checking in the guy who designed the now famous 
[01:48:30]  Wild Bumper sticker, by the way.  Yes.  He's a bitter man, so this is going to get a little ugly.  But basically, yeah, Dad said that, here, I'll get him involved with this story.  Hopefully, Brett will call in, too.  Elmo.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, I was telling this story yesterday, and you weren't listening, obviously.  Yeah, well, I was, my psychiatrist told me not to call in.  I was cringing in the corner.  Toby, Ernie wants to know if you guys called it the busky.  The busky.  Yeah, cute.  I'm never going to let that one down. 
[01:49:00]  That was as long as we remember.  So, Elm, you remember, right, we were all little kids?  Well, first, like you said, there were seven kids, but then we also had Karen, whoever  she was.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A chick who lived with us.  That's right.  Forget about it.  A chick that lived with you?  Yeah.  Like, she got kicked out of her family, so we, like, kind of, I don't know, we adopted  her for two or three years.  How old was she?  She was, like, hot.  She was hot.  She was a teenager.  I never heard about this.  I forgot.  She was, like, she was, yeah, she was in high school, and she used to walk around the 
[01:49:30]  house with no bras on and stuff.  It was really hot.  I forgot about it.  Considering there were five boys.  But the cousin Oliver of the Hughes house.  But she kind of looked like us.  They kind of looked like us, and she looked like us, and they kind of tried to pass her  off like she was a real sister.  What is this?  Little house on the prairie?  Aren't there records of who'd owned who?  All of a sudden, like, she showed up, and they tried to pass her off like, yeah, she's  a long-lost sister.  I forgot about that.  She was a little runaway causing havoc, a little ragamuffin in Mankato, so we brought  her back to Walnut Grove. 
[01:50:00]  It was our version of Oliver, actually.  Yeah.  And then, like, she had it with my parents, and she left one day, and that was it.  But she was a member of our family for two or three years.  I forgot about that.  She made us all look at each other and wonder, like, are we all natural children, or what  did they just take you out of the mall?  We cared about her so much, we even put her in the cement outside of the house.  Yeah, and I moved in the cement.  I've got to ask you, though, how old were you guys during this time?  We were like 10, 11.  Did you have some kind of crush on this chick?  Oh, yeah, she was hot.  Wow. 
[01:50:30]  You didn't hear me.  Did you try to make a move or something?  She used to walk around the house with no bras on, little hippie clothes and stuff,  and we were, we'll tell the cement story another day, Elms, because we don't want to have  kissing contacts or something.  No, I don't know.  What are you doing?  You don't want any piece of us, man.  No.  Are you kidding?  She was banging.  The tribe of us.  Who are you going to choose?  She was banging guys in our attic, though.  Another story for another day, but, yeah, so we had to do a lot of cement work around  our house.  Yeah.  And she made the masons that you are. 
[01:51:00]  The work you guys had.  Later.  Elms.  It wasn't a house.  It was a barrow.  You're either plowing the fields with your bicycles or doing cement work.  All right.  Here.  They had to empty the cement out of the bag so they could take them to school for lunch.  Yeah, for lunch.  You guys have the best upbringing.  All right.  You know what it is?  It sounds like the typical American family just off-kilter just a bit.  You know, because you're all together. 
[01:51:30]  You're going on vacate.  You're doing these family things, but it's just somehow not quite.  It always took a wicked right turn somewhere.  So, Elmo, tell Anthony about the cement.  Brett has the best stories about the cement.  We cemented everything around our house.  Everything.  And we're convinced it was just to keep us busy and keep us out of our mom's hair.  Just do things.  Yeah.  Our dad would just, he has something I've never heard of until him, a cement fetish, I guess. 
[01:52:00]  We had cement paths going everywhere.  Everywhere.  We cemented so many paths in our backyard.  We finally asked our dad, why don't you just cement the whole, throw it over and paint it green.  Right.  Because that's what it was like.  He was into cementing and rock walls.  Rock walls, yeah.  Where we would have to take the Volkswagen bus to, like, basically other people's property and steal their rocks.  Wait, you would take rocks and just stack them up in the wall. 
[01:52:30]  We had to, you know, go on a scavenger hunt and get, like, rocks from the woods.  My dad would pull up.  I'm not kidding.  Back then, you know, the Centiport area and stuff, it's not as built up as it is now.  He would just pull up to a hill and go, all right, kids, and we'd have to go running out and find rocks.  Get rocks.  The perfect size rocks for, you know, rock walls.  So you would mix it all up.  Yeah.  Mix the cement.  And we were eight or nine mixing cement from scratch. 
[01:53:00]  That's wrong.  All day long.  All day long.  I'm not kidding.  As Brett says, we went up to the barracks.  And it was like barracks because we had, like, there was a time we had five boys in one room, two bunk beds, as the chick is having sex in the attic.  Oh, yeah.  God damn, this is twisted.  Well, you know what?  That's my other sister.  One of her boyfriends was living in our attic, and we didn't know for a really long time. 
[01:53:30]  Right, Elm?  That's right.  Come on.  The irk.  Tell me I'm lying.  I know it.  The guy, like, he was, you know, in Harberfield's terms, a greaser.  Right.  He smoked some of that pot, had the leather jacket, the whole deal.  Sure.  But all you Harberfield guys are greasers.  When you talk about greasers, he was, like, the greaser.  And he got kicked out of his house.  And he was dating my sister.  And my sister got the bright idea that he could live in the attic.  Live in the attic.  No one would hear him banging around up there.  See, clearly. 
[01:54:00]  No, we're not, this is no joke.  We used to hear noises from the attic.  And it would scare us, because we were just little kids still, 10, 11, 12.  Like, did you hear that?  Yeah, man, there's something up in the attic.  And we would tell our parents, and they're like, you're out of your effing minds.  There's nothing in the attic, you know?  Well, Dad would say, yeah, there's something up there, and it'll get you if you don't do  your cement work.  Right.  So how did we discover that he was living up there?  Because my sister would bring him food and stuff.  I think it was that one night where we woke up with my mom screaming hysterically. 
[01:54:30]  What are you doing?  I believe that's how it started.  But, hey, I could be wrong.  So, yeah.  A little fun history fact.  Yeah.  Rock walls were built by field hands in the winter to keep farm hands from leaving and  going to find other work in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Hey, thanks.  Great.  You might want to know why you were doing it.  So, I don't know.  He made a lot of noise one day.  My mom discovered it, and he was kicked out of my attic.  But, so, all right, getting back to the family vacation. 
[01:55:00]  So, Dad, like, you know, Summer was coming, and he was telling us about this great family  vacation we were going to take upstate New York.  You remember what town?  No.  It was, like, way up in the Catskills, right?  I walked it out.  Yeah, it was way up there.  It was way up there, Anthony.  So, he's telling us, you know, we're going to be way up in the mountains.  This, you know, Terry's uncle, you know, he's got this property with a house.  And all these shacks that he rents out. 
[01:55:30]  And then the stream.  All your dreams will come true, kids.  They made it sound like it was incredible.  We were going to be there for a week.  And all you kids will have your own cabin.  And there's a pool.  Sounds great.  You can run around the woods to your heart's content and burn them down.  Fish in the stream and stuff.  Right.  So, it had to be, what, an 8 to 10, maybe 12-hour trip?  Yeah, it took days.  Yeah, when you're taking seven kids, you stop a lot, you know?  Somewhere along the way, we discovered the... 
[01:56:00]  I told a lot of this yesterday, but my brother's going to help me out with some details.  I forgot.  So, somewhere along the way, we discovered that the reason we were going to see my sister's uncle  was because she inherited his property because he recently died.  And that kind of came to light in the back of the van there.  Yeah.  And we were all huddled around and Terry finally whispered to us.  Yeah.  When you're 10 and 11 and you hear, like, anything to do with death, you just freak you out.  Without a doubt. 
[01:56:30]  You don't understand it at all.  So, we finally pull up to this place.  Basically, my sister was inheriting the property.  They wanted to see what it was all about and, you know, see what they could do with it.  We pull up to the place.  Al, do you want to take it from there?  This was supposed to be our family summer vacation in paradise in the middle of the mountain.  Oh, paradise.  Our Hawaii in New York.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is like the Brady Bunch.  They're going to Hawaii.  Right.  Instead, we get out.  There's a rusted, crippled fence around what I assume was a pool, but you don't know what 
[01:57:00]  it was.  Just bobbing beer cans everywhere.  The second we exited the vehicle in a timely manner, we were swarmed by insects that the  size of bats.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Mosquitoes, like you wouldn't believe, just swarming, going for my little brothers the  most because, I guess, they're young skin or something.  Oh, dear.  So, they were, like, taken down.  Hey, was that the, was this the same trip when, where Brett saved his twin brother? 
[01:57:30]  Well, I thought that was Scott who did that.  Oh, Scott saved, Scott saved Quinn.  Scott saved Quinn.  Yeah.  From the river.  From Rolling Rapids.  It was just a stop on the way to, you know, to, like, do the laundry and the stream and  all that.  You know, some of that drive-by, uh, drive-by nature you could do, pull over and check out  the nice stream or something?  All right, we're all going to get out and check out this stream.  It was Rolling Rapids and, uh, and, uh, you know, my parents thought it would be cool  to kind of just have lunch on the rocks in the middle of this Rolling Rapids. 
[01:58:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  And my four-year-old, uh, my four-year-old brother at the time, he now works on Wall Street.  Fell in.  Oh, yeah, fell in.  And he was, he was, he was gone, man.  Wait a minute.  Get away.  Get away.  He was gone.  And, uh, and at the last second, my brother, who was downstream, jumped in.  He couldn't have been more than, uh, nine, jumped in and he hadn't saved his life.  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Scott grabbed him.  There's a waterfall close by.  Now, wait a minute.  What, what, they took you out on the rocks in the river? 
[01:58:30]  What were you?  You were, like, on the side of the river?  I don't know.  We were kids, so I guess.  He was on the side, but the water.  So, you know, you've got a slippery rock that leads right into it.  There's seven kids and Karen.  Oh, a hot Karen.  And it's time to eat your peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  So you open up the Volkswagen bus and it's like, all right, kids, we'll, we'll see you back here in a half hour.  Now, wouldn't your parents kind of, you're close to a river, maybe keep tabs on the young'uns so they don't do such things?  And it's just like, you know, you're driving along and you see that duck, the mother duck and all the little ducks trying to cross the street. 
[01:59:00]  It's pretty tough to keep an eye on everybody.  Keep them together.  Plus, we were waiting for Karen to get all wet and, you know, all that shit.  Sure, sure.  So, all I remember was I was, I was kind of, I don't know where I was, but I remember the screams like, oh, my God, my mom's losing it.  Quinn is taking off down the Rolling Rapids.  And my mom's like, oh, the river's got another one.  And my brother jumped in and saved him, yeah. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, yeah, that makes for a fun ride the rest of the day.  Oh, my God, you almost died.  Yeah, I know, man.  Near death.  You have a wet, scared to that four-year-old kid going to see a dead guy's house.  That's a dream vacation.  So, yeah, back to the dead guy's house.  So then, yeah, we discovered that the guy recently died.  And we were, you know, checking out the property to figure out what we were going to do with it.  He already described the pool.  The grass wasn't cut for probably over a year because it was, what, four feet high?  Yeah, you lost yourself in it.  Now, what did this guy that died own this hotel thing or own the whole thing? 
[02:00:00]  You know, the house was like ten outhouses in the woods that he rented out.  Ten little shacks that were kind of in the woods.  Right.  I've seen those places.  Yeah, I've seen them.  You drive by there and go, who the F would ever, ever stay there?  Right.  And they don't clean them out often and stuff.  And then we discovered the way the guy died.  Well, he was smoking in bed, and he burned himself up in half the house.  So then I went inside. 
[02:00:30]  Why'd you go in?  I made the cut because I guess I was just a little older because Darren's only, what, you're two years younger than me, and you didn't go in.  No, because we're all trying to go in just to avoid the mosquito taking us away into the woods.  Yeah, and my dad's like, all right, you don't want to go in there.  And what I saw was horrific.  I mean, we walked into where he died, and it was like just charred remains.  I mean, you saw where the bed was, and it was just burn marks everywhere.  The wall was gone because of this fire that took him and the room away. 
[02:01:00]  Dude, these are all Little House on the Prairie stories.  I got it.  You guys aren't making this up.  Every one of these stories has been in an episode of Little House on the Prairie.  Then there's a guy, the caretaker of the place, who looks at us.  He's like, we don't get many people in these parks since they built that new superhighway.  And we're like, what is going on?  And Oak was our big brother who we'd look up to.  Oh, yeah.  He comes out of the house, and we just need to look at his face.  We're like, oh, my God.  Horror.  Now we're scared to death.  We're scared to death, and we're like, we're supposed to stay here a week. 
[02:01:30]  A week, not a day.  It wasn't like we had to do this.  It was a hassle, and we're moving on to bigger and better things.  No, this is our family vacation.  So then my dad, who does nothing fazes my path, nothing in the world, was like, okay, so, you know,  everyone pick a cabin.  We are just scared to deathless.  It turns out, like, six of us stayed in one cabin because we weren't, you know, separating for anything.  Strength in numbers.  And then what?  The cabins had, like, big spiderwebs and mosquitoes, and the bed wasn't changed, and who knows how long. 
[02:02:00]  There was a straw in the corner, and it was like a horror movie where you're yelling at the screen when some guy says,  oh, I'm going to go get a Coke.  And you're like, no, he's going to die.  We're all huddled in there, and somebody's hungry.  It's like, fight the hunger.  Fight the hunger.  Don't go out until daylight.  Remember, we had our little baseball match.  We're like, all right, we'll just have a little catch, you know, get our mind off what's going on around us.  And we, like, threw it, like, twice and then had to run back in the cabin.  We were scared after that. 
[02:02:30]  Was there any TV or anything?  No.  Oh, no.  Nothing.  TV.  Burning water would have been a luxury.  So at this point, my mom is just losing it.  Just screaming at Freddy.  Freddy!  Get us out of here!  Run, run, run, run, run!  My dad's taking the burnt sheet from the bed, saying, hey, we could brush these off.  And, you know, they're fine.  You know, I was exaggerating a little bit, but my dad, like I said, nothing fades in.  He would almost do that.  So then my mom, you know, got us out.  What, first thing in the morning?  I mean, daylight was coming up and it was like, pack the car, we are out of here. 
[02:03:00]  Go on.  And we drove into town to get, I don't know, a town that was kind of like a ghost town-ish thing.  Really small town in the middle of nowhere.  We get, like, kind of a bed and breakfast place.  And my dad's like, hey, why don't we go to a movie to, you know, get our minds off what happened.  Because my mom's just freaking at this point.  The only movie playing in town at this theater that shows one movie was One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Nice R-rated movie for the seven kids and Karen. 
[02:03:30]  So you all drove, you went to a drive-in?  No, we obviously couldn't go see One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  So then we were just stuck.  Yeah, the people were like, oh, you're the ones who were inheriting the old Hopkins place.  Yeah.  You better watch out.  Some say he didn't start that spot.  Yeah, that's with the micro bus.  You guys like Scooby effing do.  That was awesome. 
[02:04:00]  With the mystery machine.  I wish Brett called him because he had a few more details.  Actually, Brett is here.  He's there?  One last thing about the bus, too.  Remember, Dad turned the seats around until we faced each other.  Yeah.  So that's what you want.  As an adult, you want to be driving for two straight days while eight kids are facing each  other, screaming and yelling and fighting.  All right.  Does Brett have anything to add to this or no?  He's trying to call in, I believe.  I want to know more about this mysterious Karen chick.  Where is she now?  We don't know.  I don't know.  One day, she was gone.  She lived with you for how long? 
[02:04:30]  Really?  A couple of years, at least.  A couple of years, and now you just don't know where she is?  This girl is like an older sister to you for two years, and you have no clue what happened  to her?  Wait.  Elmo.  Yeah.  I can't believe you.  Hold on.  Wait.  So what happened to this girl?  Yeah.  She lived with us for like two or three years, and then she couldn't take my mom anymore.  Yeah.  And one day, she was just crying in the kitchen as her boyfriend was loading up a pickup truck  and said, I'm leaving.  And at this point, we consider her sister. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  After three years, I would think.  And we hugged her, and we figured out, we'll meet her at Friendly's.  You know?  One of these days.  One of these days.  Never seen her again.  That was it.  She's gone.  She vanished.  Wouldn't it be interesting to find her?  I hear she's like in the area and has kids and stuff.  Wow.  So that's something.  But she was like the warden's daughter.  When we're out in the field and doing the cement, and she'd bring out lemonade, and we're  like, thank you, boss.  Wap it on, boss. 
[02:05:30]  We'd be staring at her, you know, wiping our brows.  Wap it on, boss.  Nice day, boss.  Water, boss.  That's funny.  Bath and break, boss.  Bath and break, boss.  Was she wearing Daisy Dukes?  No.  She'd be wearing a nice, like, yellow flower, summery dress.  Pour that cement, convict.  Plow them fields.  The only good thing about the cement in the backyard was eventually it took over all the  fields.  So we didn't have to work in the field anymore, just cement.  Work in the field. 
[02:06:00]  This is children growing up.  We planted stuff in our backyard.  We had a mini farm, man.  Yeah.  That's a story for another day.  Hey, we're still trying to get Brett.  I think he's having trouble dialing the phone.  It's very traumatic.  I like new families like this, but I never, like, had the in-depth stories like this.  But there were always these families that had a lot of kids and then just drifters that  would come in for some reason and just stay there and then leave.  Hey, man.  We have a ton of them that came and went. 
[02:06:30]  And they'd all, like, because there are a lot of families like this, especially on  Long Island.  Right.  I was friends with a few people that were in families like this.  And then they'd be, like, the guy that they'd pick up.  Oh, he had problems with his family and drugs, so we brought him in.  Oh, yeah, there's a keeper.  We were always bringing people in.  Yeah.  One day they'd just stay and I'd say, all right, I guess, accept it.  Don't ask.  Hold on.  Let me put Rob on.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's up, Rob?  I've got to let Anthony know all these stories are true, especially bringing in the new 
[02:07:00]  people, because, you know, Quinn and Brett would come home from school or something.  Hey, you want to come over and have some dinner?  Sure.  And you sit down for dinner.  And there's some guy that's, you know, right in a room upstairs who could be, like, a serial  killer sitting next to you.  And you're, like, trying to eat dinner and keep an eye on him at the same time.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, he tells the truth.  I don't know who this is.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, man.  Rob, what's happening?  All right, buddy.  Cool.  You're out, man.  Have a good time.  All right, cool.  Just some guy, isn't it?  Hey, we need the extra money. 
[02:07:30]  They were running around, man.  I'm on the lam.  Hey, Brett.  Yeah.  Here's my other brother.  Brett, what's up, man?  You guys got me shaking.  I have memories, man.  I'm in the corner crying.  We told the story, right?  That's about it.  Yeah, but don't talk about my twin brother falling into the river.  Remember that?  Yeah, who do you think pushed him?  How'd you like growing up with the twin all your life?  I want that boy gone.  Brett, were you with him when he fell in? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  See, I never saw that, but I remember he was gone, and Scott jumped in and grabbed him.  I can see a poor little kid leaning over the rock, leaning, leaning, just wants to touch  the water.  Oh, there he goes.  He's leaning over the rocks with his little cup, because we had no water in the car after  a 20-hour drive.  He wanted to drink some water?  My dad thought it would be brilliant that we get some fresh spring water from the mountains.  So we all did little chain things over the rocks.  Each one held on to a hand, and my twin brother was in the lead.  I was right behind him. 
[02:08:30]  I said, you know what?  My birthday's coming up.  We're always splitting gifts and whatnot, so there he goes.  Do you guys have to split gifts, because you have the same birthday?  Oh, my God.  Everything.  You guys share the same clothes.  Everything.  Brett's got some great stories, man.  Hand me down some eight kids.  Holy crow.  Let's not forget the time that, Quinn, you know what, in your mouth.  What?  Oh, you want to go toe for toe with stories? 
[02:09:00]  No, I don't, man.  Well, now you've got to tell that one.  It's another bad tub incident.  Yeah, see, we had, like, we had, Brett.  Yeah.  Hi, this is Dr. Orange, and when I'm not eating tacos, I'm listening to Chuck Radio.  It was horrible, for the truth, because one of seven, you know, we didn't have much hot  water, so, uh, what, what, I, I got to take a nice hot bath, and then you guys, one by  one, would go in the water after me. 
[02:09:30]  They never, they didn't drain the water.  Like, Opie would take a bath, and then the brothers had to all get in.  Anthony, the family dog, our colleague, would go before us.  That's how high on the ramp he was.  But you were bathing in used bath water.  Well, I, they used to pee in it to keep it warm.  Oh, no.  He used to go in there with, like, a little strain that's trying to pick out the hair.  So the last two in were, were the twins, man.  Like a.  Oh, bathing in gravy.  Yeah.  Like a pool skimmer.  We had to, like, skim the surface just to get in. 
[02:10:00]  The soap scum that would be in there, even after just one bath.  Oh, man.  You want to tell the story with Quinn or no?  We used to fight over the, uh, nozzles.  Uh, one was in the front, one was in the back, and we'd always argue back and forth, who's  going to be in control of the water.  They were really little.  Right.  And because it was so rare to get hot water, the first one in would take his legs and close  off the tub from the hot water again behind him, where the other kid was sitting.  So I was, I got there first, my little, uh, I guess, well of hot water in front, and I'm 
[02:10:30]  like, oh, hot water first, hot water.  My twin brother and I are arguing back and forth.  I'm like, no, no.  There's a fight over hot water in a bathtub.  So he's like, fine, you're not going to have any hot water, I'll do it myself.  And I feel this trickle down my back.  I turn around, and he's peeing on me.  But my mouth is wide open, he's peeing in my face, and I'm screaming.  Oh, it was a disaster. 
[02:11:00]  I hope that made the air.  Oh, my God.  World War III.  Basically, in case it didn't make the air, yeah, his brother decided to make his own  hot water, and, uh, and Brett turned around at the wrong time.  There you go.  Let's see what, uh, what Ben's writing.  Yeah, it was dumb.  Oh, it was dumb.  That was dumb.  He made his own hot water with his own hot water.  And when you turned around, because you felt something on your back, all of a sudden when 
[02:11:30]  you turned around, now it wasn't on your back anymore, it was on your front.  Oh, because my mouth is...  And due to your screaming, you can only imagine what was happening.  All right.  All right.  I think we all know.  Well, there's just a little peek.  We can't tell them all today.  It's funny.  By the last bath, the baths of us like the garbage compactor in Star Wars.  I'm big smaking, man.  We need to have a family day at the studio. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  3PO!  3PO!  Open the door into the compactor level!  You want to clean?  Yeah, one of these days we'll do that.  All right, I'm out.  There was the family vacation story.  That's really, really disturbing.  And you made me think of someone I haven't thought of in years.  Karen.  Karen.  The hot Karen.  The hot Karen.  We've got her name in the cement.  Very good.  The cement's still there?  Oh, yeah.  And your names are all in it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I've got to take a picture of it now. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, come on.  That's a popular thing to put on the website now.  All right, guys.  You done?  Yep.  All right.  There they go.  A couple of my brothers.  I don't know how you got this far.  That is really bad.  No, Karen was not sold off into slavery, Rick.  How do you know?  You don't know where she went.  I have no idea.  I'm the sweetheart. 
[02:13:00]  That's the a-hole over there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The W-E-N-N-C-T-E-E-W.  Catch the best of Opie and Anthony.  Saturday, Mays, 11 to 3.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  We're in the middle of FU Friday.  Hey.  It's Opie and Anthony Cowbell, Bill in the studio, and Anthony's brother, Joe, hanging  out for a bit here.  Sure.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 if you want in on the show.  Now, while we were in commercials, you were trying to say something about Marilyn Monroe. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  They just did a huge auction, made an S-load of money off her stuff, and like $8 million  auctioning off her goods, and $42,000 paid for a few bikinis.  They were selling her bikinis?  I didn't know that.  A set of bikinis, including a leopard skin print, bikini bottom, estimated at $2,000 to  $2,500, but the whole set sold for $42,000.  I don't know who bought it, but you've got to know, right? 
[02:14:00]  If you're buying Marilyn bikinis, you've got to take the sniff.  Oh, come on.  You've got to take the sniff.  Come on, Ed.  You're home, alone, finally out of the limelight for buying these things.  You lay them out.  Get them in your footage.  Yeah.  You know, live with them a little, and then you just bring one up and...  It's got to smell like mothballs at this point.  Why, she's screwing moths?  Yeah.  It smells like Joe D.  You know, the guy from the Home Shopping Network should have did that auction. 
[02:14:30]  It would have been much more interesting.  Limited edition people.  Look at this bikini bottom.  Smells like Joe D's finger.  Me dialing.  Look at this one.  It's stained people.  Obviously, this was before she could fly on the wings of a maxi.  A little bit of leaky.  What about the birthday dress, Home Shopping? 
[02:15:00]  Happy birthday, Mr. President.  Yeah, that dress.  When she sang that and allegedly had sex with him right afterwards.  Right.  Actual President's blues.  DNA people, clone your own Kennedy with a head.  It's a lie.  It's so we're all having fun.  Yeah, we're having fun, all right.  Isn't it common knowledge that Marilyn Monroe had a flatulence problem?  Yeah.  Oh, that's true.  That bikini could tell. 
[02:15:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Time out.  I never heard that before.  It is common knowledge.  Plenty of people said that she would, like, all the time...  She'd fight all the time.  Imagine that.  Happy birthday, Mr. President.  Hey, uh...  Whoa, that stinks, Marilyn.  I'm going to ditch you, but Bobby will take you.  Bobby.  No, I guess some of those bikinis might show some telltale. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, I'm so sorry.  You know, I think there's proof of that, too.  There's a picture.  She wasn't standing over any air grate when her dress blew up.  That was all her, baby.  That was after White Castle, is what you're saying, Anthony?  Yeah.  Yeah, and then she blew out the candles on the President's birthday cake.  Oh, my God. 
[02:16:30]  My goodness, Marilyn.  Look at my head went back and to the left.  Back and to the left.  That's the first shot I took to the head.  My God.  Was the candle still waiting?  It blew the cake up.  Funny, I don't remember this being chocolate frosting. 
[02:17:00]  Didn't Mel and John write a song about her problems?  Yeah, passing the wind, right?  Oh, my God.  I'm more frightened that you just found out you can do Marilyn Monroe's voice.  I could do that.  Do that again.  Come on.  Put on the hose, baby.  Happy birthday, Mr. President. 
[02:17:30]  Happy birthday, Mr. President.  Happy birthday.  Oh, God.  Ah, Marilyn, soon we'll be calling this the brown house.  It looked like I rode my 10-speed bike through the mud puddle. 
[02:18:00]  It was clear up to my ears.  Oh, man.  Oh, it's so long.  Oh, God.  I'm sure the guy that got those bikinis knows, and we can only speculate.  Hey, who's the gal and Phil О'Berry.  Oh, he found a type of ?!  Yeah, it's my child.  It's just aべ cheep.  It's the worst radio I've ever heard in my entire life.  Make the fence. 
[02:18:30]  You guys are making me assy dick over here.  This stuff is terrifying, man.  I think people that call radio stations are losers.  Opie has asked me.  Bring out the best in the people today.  1027 WNEW.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW. 
[02:19:00]  All right, FM Talk at 1027 Talk You Can't Ignore.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Manny in the studio helping us out.  And the fine female cops, Lisa and Karen.  Very pretty cops.  I was very surprised.  I was expecting two beasts to enter the studio.  I've got to be honest with you.  Oh, my God.  And Anthony's up first, I guess.  It's time to resist an arrest.  I don't want to be surprised.  I was hanging out with Jay Moore.  It was like 1 in the morning. 
[02:19:30]  When we left Paisano's, I didn't even get to sleep until, like, 2.  You knew we were coming.  So now you've got an excuse when they kicked your ass right now.  Yeah, I know.  I'm kind of pooky.  Yeah.  You better go.  All right.  All right.  Anthony is taking it.  Wait.  She says the rules now.  Because she gets all the guys on their knees with their hands behind their head before you even approach them.  No, we can't.  Absolutely.  So what?  You say, like, you know, get on your knees.  Get on your knees.  Hands above your head.  And then you holster your weapon. 
[02:20:00]  Walk up to them with your cuffs.  And then the second you touch one of us, then we can start the resisting.  You got it.  So we're going to start on our knees?  Yeah.  Oh, we got a couple.  Probably for our own benefit, to tell you the truth, because if she flips a leg out, we're just going to go on the floor anyway.  All right.  Well, Hank, get up.  You're first.  Oh, this is blowing.  Lisa is convinced she could get Anthony handcuffed within 30 seconds.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Lisa, you have a real nice body, by the way.  That little belly shirt going on. 
[02:20:30]  Dude, check out the other one.  Yo.  Wow, they're both really nice.  All right.  Oh, God.  All right.  Anthony is...  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me explain.  Hey, get a mic.  Rick, get a mic to Anthony.  And turn the other way so you can face right into the mic.  All right.  Anthony is on his knees.  Hold on.  And you got your knees, your legs crossed behind you, too?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Lisa is behind Anthony.  Anthony is putting his hands in front of him like they're against the wall. 
[02:21:00]  He's on his knees.  His legs are crossed behind him.  Lisa's got the handcuffs.  Wait.  Who's got the stopwatch?  I got it.  All right.  I got it.  Rick, you tell him when to go, okay?  All right.  I'll give you a five-second countdown, okay?  Wait.  You're starting from that position?  No, man.  Hey, hey.  Oh.  What is this, man?  Hey, we ought to be arresting people in Beverly Hills.  Right.  Yeah.  We got to, like, fight a little bit.  There ain't nobody going to do anything to do all that. 
[02:21:30]  Wait, wait.  Anthony's got...  You guys will learn from my mistakes.  Oh, Anthony's just going to be a cop-out.  Ant's got his hands behind his head.  He's on his knees.  Okay.  Ready?  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Ready?  Set.  Go.  Go.  All right.  Ant's fighting.  Whoa.  The cops got him down.  They are struggling with Antony.  Oh, look at the hell.  They're all over him.  Oh, my goodness.  Ant's fighting like a mother.  Okay, Lisa.  Lisa's got one arm and the other cop's got the other arm. 
[02:22:00]  Ant is getting busted up.  His face is crunched against the couch.  They both have him down.  All right.  Oh.  He's up.  He's up.  He's fighting.  He's fighting.  God, I feel like I'm watching an episode of the cops.  It's at 20 seconds.  Ant's fighting.  Lisa.  Lisa's got him down.  Oh, Ant's running.  Ant's running.  He's done.  He's making his way for the door.  He's making his way for the door.  They're fighting.  Oh, they're down.  Oh, my God.  This is like Fight Club.  We just hit 30 seconds.  All right.  I think Ant is tiring. 
[02:22:30]  Lisa's on his back.  Karen's got the one arm.  Lisa's got the other arm.  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  One handcuff is on, and here goes the other handcuff.  Karen is screaming at him to put his other hand around his back.  And Ant is...  I can't see a thing.  You're going to have to let me know.  Ant is tough.  Huh?  At 58 seconds.  Hey, but they kicked his ass.  They did kick his ass.  Wow.  He ain't moving.  Holy cow.  Get...  All right.  Get Ant up so he can talk. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, they're even lifting him up.  Goddamn, Ant.  You look like a...  Wow.  Ant, you look like a criminal right now.  Yeah.  He does.  He is out of breath.  He's on the lesbian couch right now.  Wait.  Get a mic.  Get a mic on him.  Yo.  He's not moving from that couch, though.  Hey, you're not even tough.  Holy...  All right.  You girls are kind of tough.  All right, Ant.  He's out.  Yeah.  Ant is exhausted on the couch.  I'm feeling in my right thumb.  Ah.  He made a nice dash for the door. 
[02:23:30]  If he could have gotten out of that door, he was home.  Oh, yeah.  Ant, how do you feel?  Exhausted.  Exhausted.  You look it.  Woo!  Say.  Ladies, I must say, that was very impressive.  Wow.  She cuffed you.  She's got a belly shirt on.  The choke hold.  They put you in a choke hold?  I didn't see that.  Choke hold.  I felt myself slipping away.  All right.  They're taking the handcuffs off, Ant.  Ant, I think you're officially part of Fight Club as well, by the way.  Yeah.  Because that was like resisting arrest and Fight Club all in the same thing, man. 
[02:24:00]  Ant, you didn't fag out at all, baby.  Man, I was trying to get out the door.  You almost made it to the door.  All right.  Ant's getting back to his little area in the studio.  Dude, let me tell you something.  Yeah.  At first, you could tell they were being a little gentle.  Like seeing how far I was going to take it.  At the point I tried to run away, I was put in a choke hold.  I saw that.  My head thrust to the floor.  I saw that.  The one cuff was kind of twisted on my arm.  I thought my wrist was going to break. 
[02:24:30]  And then I just gave up.  I went, okay, okay.  And I actually said the F word.  Like I was really being arrested.  I'm like, crap.  They got me.  Look at how happy they are.  Oh, wow.  All right.  How long did I last?  58 seconds.  All right.  That's not bad.  Proof to you guys out there that we can do it.  That was pretty impressive.  You're too gay, man.  Karen, how tall are you?  We know Lisa's like 5'1 or so.  I'm about 5'5.  Holy Jesus, man.  Okay, that's warm water.  Whew. 
[02:25:00]  Well, you're a cop.  Isn't that going to give you the good stuff?  Oh, I'm just kidding.  You're next.  Manny, you ever see that happen in the neighborhood?  Yeah, all too many times.  Yeah, Manny, this is like a nightmare for you.  Only rarely it's a white guy like me.  No, you believe me.  Thanks, Beth.  20 seconds in, you was the average criminal, Ed.  I was.  I was fighting for my freedom.  When your hat came off, you was a cocaine smuggler, man.  What's up, my brother?  Why are we being oppressed?  I'm going to start calling you Khali. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Oh, that was impressive.  All right.  Do I have to go next?  I don't want to go now, man.  Come on.  All right, I'll go.  You're next.  I'll go.  Oh, man, I'm going to look fagged up.  You're not allowed for about 10 seconds.  I've got to get a mic closer.  Boy, these ladies are rough, man.  The harder you fight, the more they will fight you.  Dude, after seeing what you went through, I'm, like, shaking right now.  Whew.  Oh, God.  My heart is pounding.  All right, Opie's down on his knees. 
[02:26:00]  I thought the lesbians got my heart pounding.  Forget about it.  No, this is good stuff.  Now, were they able to get the first cuff on before you started fighting?  Let me tell you, the second you feel metal on your wrist, you can start resisting.  But the second you feel it, one is tough.  I mean, it's very hard.  I think Opie's going down quick.  See, brother, let's get the timer, too.  I got the timer ready.  Let me know when you guys are ready.  Hey, help me out, man.  You got my back, right?  Can I do that?  No, you can't.  There's one. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, Opie, there they go.  There it is.  Opie's on the floor, man.  They are fighting them.  Oh, wow.  They are fighting, man.  They're riding them.  All right.  They're both uncomfortable.  They got him in that damn hole.  He's kicking his legs.  I just saw two legs fly up.  Wow.  Is he screaming?  Yeah.  Yo, this is real.  I don't know if I'm doing this.  One arm's back.  He's at 20 seconds now.  Holy.  He's got him almost at 20 legs. 
[02:27:00]  He is fighting, man.  And 30 seconds.  Yo, they are playing rough.  Yeah.  They've got his head pinned to the floor.  He's cuffed.  He's cuffed.  Wow.  Ah, jump out.  Oh, jump out.  I jump, I jump, I jump.  Oh, they kicked your ass, man.  Get up.  Get up, Conrad.  Wow.  Get up, you criminal.  That was in 39 seconds.  How about that?  Holy crap.  You freely give that last hand over when they start hurting you. 
[02:27:30]  I, 39 seconds, dude.  Holy cow.  I honestly thought it was going to last a minute, but they were pulling that right hand.  Hey, it hurts so bad.  You know what?  You freely give up the uncuffed hand.  It hurts so bad.  It's like, all right, it's over.  It's like, I was, I was trying to stay as long as I could, and then it just hurts so much.  I know, that's how they got me.  Look at my wrist.  That's how they got me, dude.  You're welcome, dude.  Wow. 
[02:28:00]  It was like a rodeo.  The way, the way legs were flying up.  Dude, the way their legs were kicking up like a freaking Bronco.  I don't know what else to do.  Rick could be a rough one.  Look at it, look at his guns he's got.  Look at the arms on him.  I just got my ass kicked by a girl.  It's like 5'1", 95 pounds.  I'm being beat up by girls.  All right, well, Rick is up next.  Rick's got a couple of guns on him there.  If you look at his arms there, lady.  We'll see if he's packing.  Ah.  Yeah, I didn't like the grabbing of the cojones. 
[02:28:30]  I don't know.  After getting my face smashed into the rug, it was a little too much.  You got to do what you got to do.  I understand that, Karen.  Thank you.  All right.  And, you're making your way over there?  Yeah.  Okay.  I got to be able to see this, you know.  All right.  Rick is on his knee.  Wait, who's got the watch for Rick?  Who's got the stopwatch?  All right, Spaz, though.  Spaz is going to keep time.  Uh-oh.  I'm just kidding.  All right.  Rick is on his knees.  His hands are behind his head.  Hands behind his head.  The second they touch, the time starts fast. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, they're going.  All right.  Rick's face on the ground.  He's curled up in the fetal position.  They got both of their arms around his head.  Double headlock.  His one wrist is cuffed.  He's sitting up now.  Wow.  They're having a tough time with Rick.  He's on his stomach.  No, he's back up on his knees.  Whoa.  The one kick stepped on his ankle.  He's screaming, Anthony.  Yeah.  They were really pulling out all the dirty tricks for Rick. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Rick's doing quite well.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  The cops are getting crushed.  They're having a tough time getting on the hook.  Take him out.  Oh, there you go.  His face just went into the floor.  All right.  Whoa.  Watch those cart racks.  All right.  All right.  Rick is screaming.  They're just bending his arms now.  Rick is screaming.  He's on the floor.  Rick is screaming in pain.  He doesn't want to give up that arm.  He doesn't want to give up the arm, but he's going to have to.  Here we go.  Here it comes. 
[02:30:00]  Give it up, Rick.  He went a minute.  He went a minute so far.  He's running out of steam, though, Ant.  He is really resisting that.  Oh, they got the chokehold on him now.  They almost had that arm behind him twice.  There it goes.  There it goes.  One arm.  He's rolling back over again.  No one talking trash, though.  Everyone is saving their breath.  Oh, my God.  He's got him in the chokehold.  Rick is exhausted.  Rick is exhausted.  We're up to a minute and a half. 
[02:30:30]  Rick is doing a great job.  A minute and a half.  Oh, there it is.  Rick is all control of his butt.  His butt is kind of, whoa.  He is putting up a fight.  There's stuff flying.  A minute and a 45.  Oh, he's grabbing the package.  That's not good.  I knew Rick would put up a good fight.  He's got them arms.  Yeah, I know.  That's true.  I'm a little tired from cuffing Ant and I, but Rick is definitely doing a good job here. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, he said, ow.  That's not a good sign.  No, he's not.  He is not giving up, man.  The one cop has her knee on Rick's throat right now.  It's his head.  On his head.  Oh, Rick is screaming.  Oh, look.  He goes, all right, all right.  Time.  Time.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  Son of a whore, he says.  He is in pain.  The girls are exhausted.  The more you fight, the more they'll fight, Rick. 
[02:31:30]  Them's the rules.  Oh, they want to leave him cuffed.  All right.  Rick is not getting up.  You all right, Rick?  He's exhausted.  Look at him.  That was brutal.  Fight club.  That was brutal.  That was great.  I saw a knee on Rick's cheek at one point.  Rick is the champion.  He lasted two minutes, 15 seconds.  His face was, you know something?  Rick can take some pain because that cuffed hand was just turning white.  Oh, look at his wrist. 
[02:32:00]  There, man.  Look how tight they had that cuffed.  He wouldn't give up.  Rick, grab a mic.  Look at that.  They got you good.  Rick, what was the breaking point?  Where you finally said, all right, all right.  What was hurting so bad?  I thought I was going to get something.  I heard one point you said, all right, all right.  Yeah, because the cuff got so tight right there on that vein.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all black now.  Yeah.  That's where it was just like, okay, I don't want to break it.  Right.  You all right, Rick?  We're sorry if we hurt you.  He's got a nose. 
[02:32:30]  What's that little move you do to take out the ankle?  Oh, you step on the ankle, and you're pushing it in, and they can't do anything.  Yeah.  It hurts.  It's very painful.  Rick bleeding from the nose.  Wow, he's bleeding from the nose.  Bravo.  We have blood.  We have blood.  All right.  We like blood on the Opian Answers.  Yeah.  Wow.  I must say, ladies, that's quite impressive. 
[02:33:00]  I've never seen his hair messed up before.  He's a rat.  He started fresh.  We started after cuffing, too, a couple prior to that, so it took a little while.  I think he's like a girl.  He doesn't even count.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  I don't think girls need any excuses.  I think you did great.  Whoa.  Look at the cart rack.  Look at the leaning power of cart racks.  We've got to fix the studio before we get out of here today.  Woo.  I was really turned on for a second there.  Yeah, for a second.  Did you see what you did to your package to try to make you resist?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:33:30]  I had a face full of my own stuff.  Yeah, you were.  You were completely in the snail position.  Manny, what do you think?  I'm pretty impressed.  I'm pretty impressed.  Yeah, I was pretty good.  I can't take anything away from the girls.  Yeah.  You guys are pretty tough.  What a show this has been, huh, Ant?  Woo.  I'm exhausted.  Rick, what's up?  Yeah.  Rick, you look completely fed.  Rick, let's see the wrist, man.  Between hypnotism and getting his ass beat up.  I hope Rick's wife doesn't come looking for us.  Wow, look at that wrist, man.  Yeah.  Damn, that's good. 
[02:34:00]  He was using, like, his ass almost as a block so you couldn't get the arm back around.  At one point, he used his ass to push me into that rack.  That's when you have to knee them in the cheek.  That's when you have to knee them in the head.  I saw the knee on the cheek, which was a great move.  Your face was squished, Rick.  It was just like...  What's your name again?  Karen.  Karen.  Karen.  Karen's stepping on my ankle.  She's stomping on it like that.  Yeah.  She's carrying me.  I'm like, what the hell?  Karen scares me.  Yeah.  Lisa does it with a smile. 
[02:34:30]  Karen has this look on her face when she's doing it.  You don't want to mess with her.  You've got to get the job done.  Yeah.  I understand that.  More than capable.  I hate to be married to her.  Who did it?  Oh, what did I do?  Oh, go on to you, bastard!  1027 WNEW.  So, Spag, he's getting a name for himself because of the Opie and Anthony show, Anthony.  And because of that, there are businesses that want Spag to appear to help out their establishment. 
[02:35:00]  Even though we don't even announce on the radio that you do the privilege gig, so I don't  even know why they're paying yet.  No.  I just wanted to ask you about that.  No.  What?  Maybe it's just advertising like that.  God!  You're right.  Because you're plugged in my gig.  Why would someone want to go to a strip club to see you?  Yeah, when I go to a strip club, I just want chicks on the stage. 
[02:35:30]  That's it.  I don't care about who's bringing them up.  Ant and I have had many opportunities to do, like, strip club gigs, and there's no reason  to, because guys don't go to a strip club to see Ant or I.  No, no.  They're coming to see Spag.  So, how long have you been doing this gig?  I'd say for a little over a month.  Uh-huh.  Mm-hmm.  And a lot of people showing up?  Uh, for the later performances, yes.  Uh-huh.  You know, because it's playoff season.  Now, what do you do when you go down there?  Uh, basically, I go down there, I get the information that I need to put in, and then 
[02:36:00]  I just put my own little spin on it.  Ah, his own little spin, Opie.  That's the point I'm paying for.  What do you mean, your own little spin?  Well, I try to put, like, maybe, like, a little joke into it, and...  Hey, I'm gay.  Like that?  Hey, I'm gay.  Hey, I'm gay.  Is that like that joke?  No.  So, you're like the emcee, and you bring up the girls, and you put your own little spin  onto the script.  They give you a script or something to do?  Yeah, I should have a copy of you.  Do you stand on the stage in front of everybody? 
[02:36:30]  Yes, I get on the stage with a microphone.  Do you work the crowd a little bit before you bring up the girls?  Yes, I do, actually.  Damn, I wish I'd videotaped me.  And if the girls are late coming to the stage, you know what he says?  Come on!  Come on!  I want to screw up his ass.  All right, so, Spaz, you do the gig of privilege, you do these stage announcements, you riff,  you were telling us, to give you a script, but you play with it a little bit.  Yeah.  And we were dying to hear what it sounds like, so we secretly taped you at your gig of privilege. 
[02:37:00]  And I got to say, man, you sound absolutely hammered.  You do sound drunk off your ass.  That must be nice, huh?  You get to go down to a strip club, get all plastered, and make money so you can give it  right back to the strip.  Yeah.  Stupid.  Stupid!  You're so stupid.  All right, so we're going to play the take for everyone, okay?  How many beers did you have at this point? 
[02:37:30]  Be honest.  Probably about five.  And were you drinking drinks also?  I may have had a shot or two.  A shot or two.  Hmm.  All right.  Well, the tape starts with the privileged DJ.  What's his name?  We should give him props here.  Kevin.  Kevin is about ready to introduce our Spaz, man.  He's representing you and I at Privilege.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Ah, yeah, gentlemen.  At this time, I'd like to welcome you all down here to Privilege. 
[02:38:00]  Before we bring out our features this evening, we have a special guest with us.  Both of you that listen to the Opie and Anthony show on 127-WNEW every day from 2 to 7.  You definitely know this guy.  People, I want to hear a lot of noise out there for Spaz.  Come on, everybody.  How's it going, everybody?  Oh, I'll listen to you.  How's it going, everybody?  How's it going, everybody? 
[02:38:30]  I just want to say, the big yellow one is the sun.  Psycho Mark loves it.  I've got to hear that again.  Here we go.  How's it going, everybody?  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 hole.  You know, I really must be a Spaz if I can't get a microphone cord untangled.  That night.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That is Spaz. 
[02:39:00]  Spaz, were you trying to make a joke?  Yes.  So what happened?  The cord was around your leg or something?  Yeah, it wasn't a cord that looked like it usually is.  So I was untying their nod as I was going upstate, and I almost tripped over the stairs.  Self-deprecating humor.  I must be a Spaz.  You know, I really must be a Spaz if I can't get a microphone cord untangled.  Were they laughing?  Did you make them laugh with that little joke there?  I heard cricket. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, my God.  Let's hear it again.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You know, I really must be a Spaz if I can't get a microphone cord untangled.  Take my life, please.  Oh, brother.  Here we go.  Let's move on.  Anyway, here's a dumb question.  Anybody listen to the Opie and Anthony show today?  Oh, great. 
[02:40:00]  Great.  Oh, great.  You just got a bunch of guys in there that want to see some boobs.  And you're trying to do stink.  You're doing stink.  Oh, my God.  They're just lonely guys that want to see some boon tang.  Imagine you're walking and you're on the street.  You want to see some gash and some boobs.  And you walk into a place and you don't see that.  You're paying money for your beers.  And what do you see?  Hey, how are you doing? 
[02:40:30]  Hey, I must really be Spaz.  Thank you.  You know, I really must be a Spaz if I can't get a microphone cord untangled.  So, anyway, here's a dumb question.  Anybody listen to the Opie and Anthony show today?  Absolutely no response.  We didn't have one listener there.  Come on.  Come on.  God, Spaz, you've got drawing power.  I must say. 
[02:41:00]  I'm not advertised.  You know, we say we're going to be somewhere where we get 2,200 people to show up.  Spaz shows up and there's not one listener from the show.  Advertising.  Advertising.  Advertising you.  Holy smoke.  Ed, listen again.  We don't have one listener there.  Let's really listen closely to the background.  Go ahead.  All right, here we go.  Anyway, here's a dumb question.  Anybody listen to the Opie and Anthony show today? 
[02:41:30]  Not one listener was there.  Why are they paying you?  They pay you so you would bring people down?  Bring people down.  Not to entertain the staff.  I feel sad.  If I was promoted.  Oh, my God.  Promoted.  All right, so he didn't get a reaction answer.  Now he starts screaming after Christmas.  Good, good.  Here we go.  I said, did anybody listen to the Opie and Anthony show today? 
[02:42:00]  Come on!  Come on!  Now you're just looking pathetic.  If at our last road show, I got up and we noticed no one was there, we would just go home.  Yeah, hey, everybody.  All right, three people are going to tell me.  What are we doing?  Hey, people, how are we doing?  Come on!  Come on!  How are we doing?  Come on!  He didn't get a reaction, so he decides to yell. 
[02:42:30]  What do you think?  No one heard you?  Well, I just thought that there was a dramatic pause or something.  A dramatic pause.  Here it is, Dan.  Listen.  I said, did anybody listen to the Opie and Anthony show today?  All right.  Oh, now he dragged it out of two people.  Yeah, it was a pretty disgusting show.  We got a couple of psychos who I'm actually hanging out with tonight who actually ate mice today.  Mice.  Ate mice live on the air.  Mice.  It's rats, you idiot.  It's the same thing.  You thought mice and rats were the same thing? 
[02:43:00]  I thought it was just another name for it.  Oh, my God.  Stupid.  You know, like, chair and feet?  You're so mad!  You're so stupid!  You are certifiable.  Oh, my God.  I'm hanging out with tonight who actually ate mice today.  Mice.  Ate mice live on the air.  But anyway, and the listeners...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He's bombing.  You're bombing.  You're bombing. 
[02:43:30]  You're bombing at a strip club.  You're bombing.  You don't bomb at a strip club.  It's impossible.  You're bombing.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I had to say I was there Friday night, right?  You were there and you saw us bad.  Yeah, but I didn't want to admit to anybody.  I kind of, like, listen to this guy on the radio.  It's like I'm there with, like, three of my friends.  They're like, hey, this guy's from, like, the O&A show.  Isn't that the guy you listen to? 
[02:44:00]  I'm like, oh, hang on.  I don't know this guy.  Are you kidding me?  So it's like he's there.  He's bombing on stage.  It's like, I swear to God, 10 to 15 people left within five minutes of.  It's like, hey, we came here to see some T&A, not some jackass like him.  Like, what the hell?  Come on, people.  All right, guys.  All right, Steve.  Oh, my God.  And we got more audio of Spaz on stage. 
[02:44:30]  My little lady, does anybody listen to the show?  All right, just this afternoon.  And everybody listen to the show.  Because I must be quite a spaz with this mic cord around my ankle.  The guy ate a bird on the show today.  I mean, in his mouth.  Yo, Adrian. 
[02:45:00]  Did someone shoot me and put me out of my misery?  How much time left, baby?  Did I earn my money?  Oh, my God.  Spaz, this is a prime example.  You couldn't get a better example of someone bombing.  Bombing.  Do you have any more jokes before you bring the girls up?  This isn't even close.  No, but I put a nice twist to it later on.  All right, here we go.  Let's move on with the tape, can't you? 
[02:45:30]  And the listeners are pretty disgusted by it, too.  And I know you probably are.  But Privilege came to the rescue today.  Because Privilege brought their main phone.  What did that guy yell?  I don't remember.  They're taunting him.  If he just said, get off.  John, I didn't tell him, get off.  Yeah, listen, I think he said, get off.  I'm on the air.  But anyway, and the listeners are pretty disgusted by it, too.  And I know you probably are.  But Privilege came to the rescue today.  Because Privilege brought their main feature to double exposure,  which I'll bring on in just a second. 
[02:46:00]  And they settled everybody's stomach.  And I'm telling you, they did things for Opie and Anthony,  live on the air today, that let's just say that your imagination can't even think of.  So, if they can do that for Opie and Anthony,  I know that they can fill all your needs.  Oh, my God.  You're getting paid to say, hey, I'm sad, and here's the gas. 
[02:46:30]  Here's the Enola Gay, dropping the phone.  What a cool.  Joey, what's up?  Hey, hey, guys, what's up?  We were there Friday with a bachelor party.  And remember that time you guys were at a Chinese restaurant and you had a tough credit?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're over there talking.  A couple of my buddies are drinking and they're having to talk with us fast. 
[02:47:00]  And he's talking about how he's not being promoted  and how you guys don't use his ideas.  I'm not being promoted!  If you guys use his ideas, the show would be a lot better.  Come on!  Let's go to Anthony, who says he was there as well.  Anthony, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I was at the show.  I was the one to scream to the stands to get the hell off the stage.  You just wanted to see gas, right?  No, I was like, I was with some friends. 
[02:47:30]  I was like, listen, I was like, you know, somebody from O&A is here.  Maybe it's like Opie or anything.  Right.  Yo, when I heard it was stairs, I got disgusted.  I wanted to leave.  And then he was sitting there boning.  I hate the guy more than anybody, and I actually felt bad for him.  We're getting feedback.  Wait a minute.  Hold on two seconds.  Usually the guest announcer is on for 30 seconds.  Effing retard stays on bombing for five minutes.  Help him with beer bottles.  And that's what I said.  It was like mercy. 
[02:48:00]  I was like, Spence, just get off.  Just leave, man.  He just stayed.  He's pathetic.  Man, Spence, thank you.  All right, guys.  We've got to give you a little tip.  When you're in that situation and you're bombing, it happens to everyone.  You get the hell out of there.  Cut your losses, man.  Cut your losses and move on.  That's what I could say.  You're going to get a nice cheer when you bring out the, you know, the boobies.  All right.  Let's move on.  So, if they can do that for O.B. and Anthony, I know that they can fill all your needs.  The privilege tonight is bringing to you double exposure. 
[02:48:30]  That's right.  Tonight, you're going to double your pleasure and double your fun in the form of Misty Knight.  You've been faced to cover on Pustler Magazine, Cherry Magazine.  You're like a carnival barker.  They're going to double their pleasure, huh?  That's bad.  It's a little joke about double exposure, double your pleasure, double your fun.  Oh, of course.  Let me show.  Right.  All right.  Let's play some more.  We've featured in over 100 adult films, including Double Exposure and Hot, Wet, and Misty. 
[02:49:00]  Also, Ashley Starr has also appeared in the covers of Cherry Magazine, Genesis, Gallery  and Store, and over 100 adult films.  You're going to get something very special tonight.  So, I see you all guys are just sitting in the back over there.  I think you should move up a little bit closer.  Come on.  Don't be shy.  Don't be shy.  You've got a lot of stickers over here.  Two in case you have them for your car.  So, if you don't get enough T&A tonight, just don't want to get some T&A as you're driving. 
[02:49:30]  Anyway, I know you don't want to see us drive on the air.  I mean, I don't know.  Oh, my God.  You are tanking.  No way.  You are tanking.  Don't you understand you're bombing?  Leave.  You should have been smashed.  You should have gotten out of there.  What the hell are you thinking?  What are you thinking?  You're standing on stage bombing.  The guys are there to see boobs. 
[02:50:00]  And they see one boob on the stage.  They want to see two boobs bouncing, not one boob yapping.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let's go back to the table.  There's been enough T&A tonight to put one on your car and you get some T&A as you're driving.  Anyway, I know you don't want to hear spaz on the air.  I mean, not on the air.  Well, on stage.  So, without further ado.  They're yelling in the background.  They're getting violent.  You can hear them yelling like Jesus Christ. 
[02:50:30]  Right.  They're all getting their guns ready.  Listen.  You can hear them annoyed in the background.  Listen closely in the background.  You can hear them getting annoyed.  I mean, not on the air.  Well, on stage.  So, without further ado.  I introduce to you, Misty Nights and Ashley Starr. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, my God.  And that was the...  Holy smoke.  Was that painful.  Jason from River Edge.  You go to a strip club to see Ass, not A-Hole.  Big C from Huntington.  Punch out, Maverick.  Punch out.  Spaz yells his left in Paul Stanley.  Mike from Jersey.  Spaz made the strippers look like Einstein.  Don King from Westbury checking in, Anthony.  Hell, Spaz, I wouldn't even promote you. 
[02:51:30]  Spaz go crash a bag.  You effing drooling mongrel on me.  Tell me your pleasure while I have the audience.  God damn, that's funny.  Eric, a.k.a.  Farmer from Rockaway Beach. 
[02:52:00]  I'm having a birthday party for my two-year-old at McDonald's.  I'd like to hire Spaz for this huge event.  Okay, people.  We'd like to bring up little Mary on her birthday.  Come on, it's your birthday.  He abuses brutal.  Really fast.  Frank from the Bronx.  You can tell he's so pissed when he writes this.  I get 45 minutes to sneak out of my wife, and I go there and had a deal with this.  So, see, it's sick. 
[02:52:30]  Ray checking in.  Spaz teach Timothy McVeigh how to bomb.  The guys that are yelling are the owners of privilege.  Oh, my God.  You guys are brutal.  Oh, my God.  That is so bad.  Stop the fight.  Stop the fight.  I like the illiterate, ignorant type guy, do you? 
[02:53:00]  You're definitely brain damage.  I have no idea.  It's always scary.  Survival of the finish.  You should not be alive.  Anyone else getting dumber in here?  Oh.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
