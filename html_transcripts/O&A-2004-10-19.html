<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious rant about an excessively long Yankees-Red Sox game, filled with profanity and scathing commentary on the players, announcers (especially Tim McCarver), and, particularly, Red Sox fans.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, complained about the game's impact on their sleep and show preparation. This segued into a series of offensive jokes, a recounting of Opie's noisy altercation with his upstairs neighbors (tap dancing and golf balls at night!), and a discussion of their show's lack of network marketing support and subsequent reliance on listener promotion. A planned, sexually suggestive Wiffle ball bat segment failed due to the participant's menstruation, resulting in more crude jokes. A caller detailed his plans for a "happy ending" massage, prompting further vulgar advice and jokes from the hosts and other callers.  The segment concluded with the playing and discussion of a sexually explicit trucker song.  There were no in-studio guests during this part of the show.

The next segment featured a caller, Ben from Phoenix, graphically detailing a disappointing $45 "happy ending" massage in Mexico.  This led to a discussion of cheap prostitution and other sexual topics.  A female caller, Jesse, bragged about past show appearances, including a whipped cream bikini contest and a "naked teen voyeur bus" incident (for which she and Jim Norton were arrested). She then performed a "queef" on air, prompting enthusiastic responses from the hosts. A New York City cop, Greg, called in to update them on the officer who provided the unauthorized escort for the bus incidentâ€”a 30-day suspension without pay.  The hosts also discussed a news story about a woman painting swastikas in Jewish neighborhoods, prompting Opie to share a lengthy anecdote about a "psychopathic" ex-girlfriend's explicit answering machine messages, his retaliatory actions (playing the messages on her family's answering machine and subsequently on the radio for many years on Valentine's Day), and other Buffalo-related stories, including his radio character "Spud Buckley" and a WBAB Opie lookalike contest.  This segment was interspersed with prank calls, song clips (including Stephen Lynch's "Big Fat Friend"), and more off-color jokes.

The show then experienced technical difficulties with the phone system, followed by Opie's humorous speculation on the illogical evolution of the New York accent.  This was followed by an advertisement for Maverick Business Consulting, several XM radio station advertisements (including their own), and a discussion of their XM mugs. A mock news segment, "Hot Team News," covered a Manhattan attorney arrested in a sex sting involving a supposed 13-year-old girl. This led to further crude humor, a weather report, sports update, and entertainment news (including stories about a man convicted of burying a pregnant teen alive, runaway teens, and Mary-Kate Olsen leaving NYU). The hosts debated the likelihood of underage girls participating in online sexual chats and discussed the movie "Thirteen."  The segment included calls from a trucker with a "freaky" waitress story and a caller unsuccessfully attempting a French accent while insulting the hosts, sparking a contentious exchange about France filled with offensive language and stereotypes.  A caller, Henry, threatened to confront a previous caller, "Frenchie."  The segment concluded with a discussion of Blender Magazine's "50 Worst Songs of All Time,"  including the story of "Club Soda Kenny" and his reaction to a Rodney King beating video at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The next segment featured a countdown of *Blender*'s ten worst songs, punctuated by tangential discussions.  "Club Soda Ken" made a brief, unremarkable guest appearance.  The hosts engaged in a lengthy, angry rant against Man Cow, playing audio clips of his comments.  They discussed the difficulty in locating audio clips and the hosts' debate on artists branching out from their established genres, featuring examples such as Madonna, Rush, REO Speedwagon, Gene Simmons, Robin Williams (Norton shares a manager with Williams), and Eddie Murphy.  A phone call interrupted the countdown, and the hosts continued to make jokes about Jim Norton's appearance.  Anecdotes about other radio personalities who criticized Opie and Anthony after their firing (Howard Stern, Don and Mike, and Charles Laquidara) were shared.  The story of a female listener who traveled far for a show challenge and her interaction with Jim Norton was also recounted.  The countdown concluded with Starship's "We Built This City" being declared the worst song, and further discussion of the Man Cow situation. An intern, Danny, showed off his Oompa Loompa shirt.

The show's final segment began with a graphic description of a sexual encounter between Jim Norton and a woman in a men's restroom during a commercial break, followed by another explicit anecdote involving Norton, a woman who took an overnight bus, and additional sexual acts in the car.  A comedic bit followed on the hosts' views on pregnancy and child support. A news report on the fatal shooting of a 14-year-old girl in Harlem was played, followed by a comedic song about a man and a prostitute.  The hosts then discussed their lagging office renovations.  Callers followed, including Pablo (displeased with the show, particularly Norton), Floyd (praising the show), and a highly offensive and sexually charged argument between "Frenchie" and "Henri," filled with homophobic and anti-Semitic slurs. The segment ended with a call from a collection agency and an advertisement for ESPN NHL 2K5.

[00:04:00]  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony are about to make their return to the airwaves 
[00:04:30]  Opie and Anthony are back  A few years ago after a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral 
[00:05:00]  They get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope  They were doing what they were paid to do  Even when there are bucks to be made  There's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural degradation that we do not want to be associated with anymore 
[00:05:30]  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, shit, piss, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits  This calls for the old Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, this is a biggie 
[00:06:00]  Oh, my God, that feels so good  Oh, my God, that feels so good  Oh, yeah, oh, oh, slow down  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah  Who's your daddy?  Who's your daddy?  Oh, my God  Oh, yeah, play with my balls  Play with my balls  Oh, that feels so good 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, just roll them around  They're so good  Oh, my God  I love it, wouldn't you?  Uh-oh, slow down  Don't move  I'll go get you a towel  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show  Hey, hey  Who's your pappy?  Who's your pappy?  Oh  Saw enough of those signs at Fenway last night  Pappy?  Pappy  Where the hell are you?  The deep south?  Who's your pappy? 
[00:07:00]  Wasn't it poppy?  I know, I say pappy, though  Who's your pappy?  Who's your pappy?  Weird gang, I'm your pappy  Who's your pappy?  Hey, pappy?  That's how I say that word  Who's your pappy?  P-p-p-pappy  Can we stop with the setting records of how long these games are?  It's record-setting length of the games  People have to sleep  Explain this to me  The games start at 5  Yeah 
[00:07:30]  So here we are  We do morning radio  So, you know, you get a little excited  You're like, oh my god  I could actually watch the whole game  Go to bed  Get six, seven hours sleep  And be nice and fresh for a morning radio show  Right  Why did I go to bed at 11.30 last night?  Yeah, because it just goes on and on and on  It just never ends  Major League Baseball at this point should just, like, cut the games in half  Let's play the first two hours  Call it a night  Everyone regroups  Yeah  And then you play the second half of the baseball game the next day 
[00:08:00]  I mean, who ended up finishing the game for the Yankees?  A fan?  I know  Who was that?  Esteban Loaiza  Yeah  What?  Loaiza  He was from the White Sox  I've been watching baseball all year long  Never seen him before  Yeah  He actually wasn't doing too bad a job up until  Yeah, I mean, that lasted  Old Honest Abe beard came up  And  David Ortiz  Decides to smack the ball again  The Yankee killer  Can somebody tell Ortiz his beard looks like a toilet seat cover?  I am so sick of him ruining our fight 
[00:08:30]  Tired of that perfectly groomed line  Well, he needed to get to the Capitol Grill to get a steak  He said, it's time to end this game  I'm hungry  Thank God he hits better than he base steals  Hey, he was safe on that play, but you're right  Stop it  That's because the  Thank God Jeter even got a hand on that ball  Why, because Posada is single-handedly trying to throw this entire championship away  Oh  But can I ask you, why would they send him on that?  I just don't get  That was one of the funniest things I've ever seen  Trying to see him steal second base  Oh, yeah, Tim McCarvey's like, oh my God, he's stealing! 
[00:09:00]  I mean, he freaked everybody out  Freaked it out  Freaked Posada out  Freaked everyone out  And McCarvey's got to just relax  He likes to think he's seeing something that we're not seeing at home  On every single play  And he loves to jinx the Yankees  Loves that jinx  Loves it  People get up that haven't had a hit  In, like, weeks  And they'll be like, oh, you know, this guy hasn't had a hit in a long time 
[00:09:30]  Oh, and to me, that's a jinx  That's a jinx  Ass  I thought Wakefield was going to blow  Well, Wakefield was a blow  Oh my God  What's his name?  Trying to catch that ridiculous pitch that they should just ban from baseball  Jesus  That is the funniest goddamn thing  They just cannot hang on to that ball  The knuckleball should be banned from baseball  Veritek never catches for him  Oh, I understand  Maribel he always catches for him  But how many pass balls?  I understand because three  McCarver told me  Yeah  McCarver has to tell me everything 
[00:10:00]  McCarver told me  Well, you know, this is only the second inning he's ever caught for Wakefield  And you didn't get Al Leiter's comments on how hard it is, you know  For a catcher to catch a knuckleball  Yeah, and he even demonstrated how you hold the ball  Right, he demonstrated how you hold it  They go in the booth with the camera  Show you the grip on the ball  Unbelievable  You like that part of it, don't you, Norm?  I really do, and also my favorite thing  Did you guys see on the National League game where they showed  Oh, there's a National League too?  Oh, yeah  What league is that? 
[00:10:30]  Our fans in Houston and St. Louis are not happy with us  I know  Wait, there's another game going on?  Did anybody see the baseball cartoon they drew?  Uh-oh  To demonstrate a pitch?  Uh-uh  I wish I could remember the name  If somebody remembers the name  It made me want to drive a nail into my stomach  It was the cutesy baseball  Hey guys, here's what a curveball is  Oh, right  It was a baseball with eyes  Oh, they're doing that with both games  Scooter  Yeah  He's called Scooter  Will Scooter  Will Scooter  Looks like a burn victim  Just two blinking eyes and a head with nothing on it 
[00:11:00]  Your burn victim humor went down well in Washington  Oh, man  Oh, are they not happy with it?  Oh, and his mic is hot  Getting a note from the booth  Let me turn you down a little bit  My mic is hot  But the worst is when they show the body  And they're showing you what part of the body  The injury report  What part of the body is hurting on the fans  Yeah  A little bit of heartbreak for the Sox fans  There's an achy heart sponsored by who cares? 
[00:11:30]  WebMD  Awful  I pay attention to everything  But how funny was it when this game was supposed to end at about 8?  They start the National League game  And they're giving you updates during the Yankee-Red Sox game  Oh, they almost finished their game  It was up to, I think, the 7th inning  By the time the Red Sox and Yankees finished  Yeah, thanks  Obviously, the Red Sox won  They pull it out of their ass again  And now we're back in New York  David Ortiz, the Yankee killer  The Astros also won last night  Beating St. Louis 3 
[00:12:00]  Zip up 3-2 in the series over there  In the who cares league  Oh  Because the Mets aren't in it  We're a little preoccupied here with the Yankee-Sox rivalry  Just a bit  I cannot stand Sox fans  I just  I can't stand them  When they pan that crowd at Fenway  I get livid  I yell things out at the television  I yell, shut up  I call the women stupid fucking whores 
[00:12:30]  When I see they're panning the crowd  I'm just like, shut up, you whore  Hate them  What about that fat pig on the first baseline  That they kept showing  They showed her over and over again  They kept showing that  And they kept showing the fag guy  With the glasses  Did you see him?  He looked like Frenchie almost  Oh, Stephen King?  He had the little round glasses  Not Stephen King  Stephen King's there writing a book  Is that what he's doing?  I don't know what he's doing  Okay, he was being interviewed  And then McCarver had to throw in  I hope you  Who was the guy who interviewed him?  Hope you don't get a spell cast on you  Oh, I know  Did you hear that? 
[00:13:00]  And as they're interviewing  If you were writing a book about this series  What kind of horror would you put into it, Stephen?  How about I take a meat cleaver out  And put it into your skull right now  I'm trying to watch the game  Shut up  Go away  How about McCarver goes to drink his coffee  And it's got some tainted blood in it  That'd be the name of the book  Ugh  Then McCarver stinks and he hates the Yankees  The dye's getting to him, too, man  He dyes his hair  Oh, like no one's business  He used to walk around here all the time 
[00:13:30]  When we were doing our old games  Really?  Oh, yeah  Never saw him  Trying to look like he's 40 years old  And he tries to be funny sometimes  And it's like there's nothing worse  Than a sportscaster trying to be funny  It's just shut up and give the facts  You're not interesting people  But there are jocks  And jocks are never funny  Never funny  In school, there were the funny people  And the jocks  And the jocks were never funny  And the funny people  Very rarely were they jocks  Absolutely  So, you know  Go with what you do best 
[00:14:00]  I was a jock growing up  You were not a jock  You're not a jock  You're sult  You might have been a wannabe jock  But I saw pictures of you  You were no jock  You probably would have maybe done well in basketball  See, the joke was  I'm a jock  And that's why I'm not funny on the show  He got it  I got it  But we didn't care for it  Because you are funny on the show  And I don't like to see you tear yourself down like that  Especially with a body like you have on you  That goddamn V going right down there off the stomach  It's a swimmer's body  Weren't you a wannabe jock though?  Huh?  You were a wannabe jock though 
[00:14:30]  My sport was basketball  I just didn't get the height  But you were pretty skinny  You were a pretty skinny guy in school  What do you mean was?  I still am pretty slender  Slender  We both had the potential a couple of years ago to put on a few pounds  That's what I'm saying  You know what?  And you can tell who is not a sports fan when you're watching these games  The phone rings with stupid people that have no clue what's going on in the real world  Stupid Bob called last night  Are you kidding? 
[00:15:00]  Our agent from LA  He's super agent Bob Eatman when he's dealing with lawyers  But he's stupid Bob when he calls during the game  No, but he's stupid Bob as far as everything else goes in his life  This guy's stupid  He calls, it's 4-4 in the 12th inning  Yeah  Phone rings  Hey Hope, just check it in, want to see what's going on  What's going on?  Do you have a TV near you?  Wow  Oh, you don't want the phone call  My phone rang and it was you  But at least you know to call during the commercial break  Obviously  I call up Anthony, I'm like 
[00:15:30]  Are we ever going to get to sleep?  The phone rings  And I was just like, who is this mad person?  No, no  Who is this mad person?  Come on  There was a quick conversation during the commercial  Well, how long did White Earl talk from LA when he called in?  White Earl  A few minutes and then, you know, because he's inviting us all out to dinner  Because he's coming to New York  Boston Strangler  On Whackbag.com 
[00:16:00]  Ha ha, Yankees suck  Deal with it, Ant  Yankees are going to lose  Opie's sports curse is going to ruin your Yankees  Excuse me  Opie was rooting for the Sox  You dickbag shit fuck  Yep  He was rooting for the Sox  Yeah, and keep it with the Yankees suck thing  Keep going  Keep going  This is textbook Yankees socks  Textbook  You know why?  Because it's not a sweep  The hope is still there  The hope in you  Your stupid heads  Under your stupid Boston caps 
[00:16:30]  Is building and building and building  Keep your signs coming  Keep the who's your daddy signs at the game  Keep that hope alive  Keep we can do it  Steal more Mets slogans with the we believe thing  Steal more anything from New York, you jealous bastards  Because it's going to end the way it ends  With the Yankees winning  And the Sox once again  Dejected losers  Hoping next year is a little better  I hear a little panic in your voice, Anthony 
[00:17:00]  A little panic  A little panic  I'm very happy  You're panicking a little bit  And you know what?  Very happy they're coming back to New York  Schilling is pitching today  And they got a special shoe for him  His Nike?  No, Reebok  Reebok  What a product placement that was too  They did a whole commercial for this Reebok  They're going to come out with the Schilling  Yeah, Reebok designed a special shoe  So Curt Schilling can pitch tonight  And Tim McCarver  Did you  I hate Tim McCarver  We said this a little earlier  He's trying to see things that are just not there 
[00:17:30]  Yeah  They drag Curt Schilling out of the dugout  And put him in the bullpen  That was just to get the crowd just out of their minds  Oh, it was crowd manipulation  Stop it  They're walking like in slow motion  Like the beginning of Reservoir Dogs  Out to the friggin' bullpen  Right  Stop it, drama  And McCarver's like  Whoa, hey, what's going on here?  Schilling going to the pen  Is Schilling going to come in?  What?  Shut up  Shut up  You jackass  Tell it like it is  They were just manipulating the crowd  That's all that was about  Stop it  And that dummy fell for it 
[00:18:00]  God  It's funny when they were panning the crowd too  Everyone was just like  They could barely keep their eyes open  I know  They're all falling asleep  Baseball should not take five and a half hours  Baseball is a boring sport by nature to begin with  And it shouldn't take five and a half hours  I don't know  I liked that game last night  I didn't like the results  But that's a good game  Yeah, I would have liked it better with a Yankee victory  Dude, what do you mean you liked the game last night?  I called you too and you were getting updates from me on the phone  You didn't even watch the game  I don't think you even watched it  I did my two sets  I did an animal rights benefit  So then I get to bed at 11 
[00:18:30]  And then Douche and Mrs. Douche upstairs decide they wanted to do tap dancing at 1130 at night  I am so happy I have no upstairs neighbors anymore  And they're also rolling golf balls or something on a wood floor  I used to get the same thing, neighbors above me  You'd get this sound like a ball rolling on a floor  I'm like, what are they doing up there?  Like they're bowling  I don't know what they were doing  But they were tap dancing  I mean, it was like  Back and forth in their apartment 
[00:19:00]  Upstairs neighbors, never good  So then I jump up on my bed  I just start pounding the ceiling as hard as I can  I thought I cracked my hand  And then you hear them  Well, you don't hear them  They get really quiet  Like, what's that?  And then they start in again  I'm like, ass  It's that most important person  In the world is me  Mindset  They don't know that there's people living below them  And if they do think about it for a second  It doesn't matter  Because they're not as important as me 
[00:19:30]  See, I'm finally winning this war  Because this has been going on a while  But we were off the air for two years  And, you know, I'm sleeping in  So it used to be even later at night  So let's say I crash at like 1231  The same noise is going on upstairs  But I'm like, yeah, whatever  I could sleep in  It doesn't matter  You know, you're not going to affect my sleep  Right  But now we have to get up at 334  Depending on if there's a freaking baseball game  So now, this morning  I started a new thing with them  They think they're cute  That they're not going to stop  You know, walking across the wood floors  And practicing their putting 
[00:20:00]  And their tap dancing  Apartment 2  That's the best  4.15 in the morning  So long, everybody  I'm going to work  There you go  Keep it up  Keep it up  Nice one  Keep it up  Oh, yeah  That's a good one  Not just ding, ding  I just went  With all the anger  I could push in my little finger  Screw apartments  You know what my grandmother used to say  When someone was that selfish  Like when they would just drive  Like be driving selfishly 
[00:20:30]  She would always look over and go  Hooray for me  The hell with you, huh?  Freakies  That's what she would say  When somebody was behaving selfishly  Oh, brother  So there you go  Another exciting night of baseball  Can't wait to watch that tendon  Pop out of that nice Reebok shoe  Oh, I know  Just watch that tendon  Fly out of the tendon sheath  It's supposed to be in  Pop off at the top of that high top  Watch him go down  Just snap 
[00:21:00]  I think  It's like a piece of gristle from meat  It's over tonight  It's over tonight  Yeah  I think  Back at the stadium  Let's do this  Get it done  I don't know who's going to pitch  I mean, everyone pitched last night  I think they went through 18 pitchers  And if one more dumb Boston fan says  Momentum has switched  Shut up with your momentum  How about in 2001  When Arizona won two  And the Yankees won  The three most dramatic games  I've ever seen played in baseball  And then promptly go back to the West Coast 
[00:21:30]  And get the stupid Yankee faces smashed  15-1  Right  And then lose game seven  So stop with the momentum  It means nothing  Alright, let's grab a couple of phone calls  And then we've got to move on  We've got lots of stuff to do today  My ears hurt  Corey from Rochester  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hi, Corey  Boston fans are the worst  I was on a train into Boston  Friday night  Everybody on the train is like praying  That the game's going to get rained out  Like 7.45  The conductor announces it  The whole train just blew up  They're like, yeah 
[00:22:00]  We won't get humiliated for another night  Fucking ridiculous  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of their fans  I'm really not  All the stupid paint  And the dumb wigs  Alright  You know what?  Relax, dude  You're going to see some  Some dopes at Yankee Stadium  During the game today  You know something?  I love how you think  That like the Yankee fans  Are like rocket scientists  Plenty of dopes  I understand  A ton of dopes  Which will be seen in the stands tonight  Believe me  But not as dopey as Boston fans  Maybe they won't be wearing the rally cap  Upside down backwards  But, you know 
[00:22:30]  At least they're dopes  Don't have a reason to cheer  Because they're wearing the makeup  Of a paint  Because the team has won  They're not hanging on to some curse  Ooh  And the dopey signs  And the dopey red  Yeah  Red  Stick things that they hit together  Yeah  You call them the dog penises  The dog penises  That's what they look like  Hey, Doug from Ethico  What's up?

Five and a half hours?  Six hours?  Close to six hours, right?  I was eating dinner last time  I'm like, sweet  You know, I can watch this game  Get to bed  At like ten tonight  They need a pitch clock  Is what they need  Just pitch the ball  Every twenty seconds  That's all we ask  Like in the NBA  With the shot clock  They need a pitch clock  Or they just need 
[00:23:30]  Like we said  Cut the games in half  Do the first two and a half hours  And just call it  Call and let everyone  Because the fans need a break  They need to get some sleep in them  You get your pitchers  A little healthier  Change the entire game  That's ridiculous  Just start the games earlier  Just start them earlier  And then you can just  Kind of watch it  Dude, the game started  It ended at five  It ended after 11 o'clock  That's what started at two  That's what I'm saying  Started at two  Attaboy  Doug, what's going on?  Hey, I want you to know  I got one of those little  XM boom boxes here at work  Yeah  And gradually, every day

[00:25:00]  Our name isn't getting  Out there enough  Through  The company promoting us  So we do stuff  That's incredibly stupid  But gets a lot of news  Anthony and I are like  Just picture twins  At, I don't know  Bennegan's  Wanting attention  Screaming and yelling  And screaming  Throwing things  We're yelling and screaming  We need something  Don't ignore us  Wah  So they're not  Marketing the show  So our listeners  Have taken it upon themselves  That they're starting  Some grassroot  Promoting

[00:28:00]  They're not as bad  The girls  At Fenway  As they are  At some other stadiums  Like they got  I guess because  There's so many  Sox fans  In Boston  That they  They kinda get  Some cute girls too  Can Joe Torre show  Some emotion  Either way  He does  When he's happy  He picks his nose  Up to the first knuckle  Yeah he's gotta  Stop picking his nose  On TV  He picks his nose  Up to the second knuckle  You know  I like that  No  There's something that  I mean picking  Picking your nose 
[00:28:30]  Is pretty brutal  No matter who's doing it  Yeah  But with him  It's extra brutal  Yeah  Cause he's got  A big honker  And hair growing out of it  You see all the dark hairs  And it's a big huge  Gap there  And he gets  He does get up to the second knuckle  Oh he digs deep  He digs deep  Like dude  You're on national TV  This game's being shown  All over the world  He was looking for a pitcher  Up there last night  Is what he was doing  Digging around  Where  Who's  Dimitri  What's going on  Hey  I almost got arrested 
[00:29:00]  Last night dude  You almost got arrested  Why  My wife  I want to watch myself proper  I want to watch myself proper  I said  Fuck yourself proper  Because I'm watching the game  The game is supposed to be over  I said  I don't care  I mean I have one  One TV  Cause I just moved  And the bitch  Is living the fuck alone  I agree sir  What did you crack her in the head  Yeah  Oh no  Yeah  I grabbed her by the neck  A little bit  But I know  What happened  Did she come home  And you said  Where'd you go  And she said 
[00:29:30]  The movies  And you said  What'd you see  And she went  Father of the bride  And you grabbed her hair  And beat her in the bathroom  You know  She just isn't the fuck  That long dude  That's fucking unbelievable  You know  Woman can't stop  Alright  Alright  You guys got  Listen  Alright  We're not going to listen to you  Thank you Dimitri  Who was the  The little girl  That was singing  In the seventh inning  Oh yeah  The 13 year old  Yeah  There was a like  Massive delay  And it looked like  She was lip syncing it  Or something  Well that's because  The stadium

[00:30:30]  First of all  The guy looked like  A lunatic  He looked like  A madman  And he really  Wasn't that good  But again  I will say  Why  Why did the  Sox do that  Why did they do it  Because New York  The Yankees  Had the New York  The cop  That would come out  And sing the opera  And he would sing  And because Boston  Has to do everything  New York does  And the Yankees do  They had to drag out  A cop that could sing  That's right  And he wasn't even that good  And he looked like  A lunatic 
[00:31:00]  I would hate to get  Pulled over by that guy  He'd probably shoot you  For the speeding ticket  I don't know  When were we going to  Have Steven Tyler  I thought Steven Tyler  Was going to do  The National Anthem  One of the games  That's hip  That's hip now  I hope Justin Volpe  Sings it when they  Come back to New York  You can hit that high note  They just let her rip  Plunge her with a flag  On the end of it  Listen they're getting  Pissed off at us  That we're talking  About baseball too much  This is instead of  Playing 20 minutes  Of commercials  So let's relax  Don't worry about it  It's early people  Speaking of which

Because I didn't see  One black person  In the sea of white fans  Yeah I know where  People are getting sick of us  Talking about baseball 
[00:39:00]  We'll move on in a second  But that is the truth  Boston likes to  That transcends baseball  It's just Boston  Boston is trying to  Show the world  That they're not as racist anymore  But all you have to do  Is watch one Boston Red Sox game  And you see that  They got a long way to go  Pan that crowd  White faces  Long long way to go  While Matsui was batting  They kept showing this  Asian woman in the audience  Oh I know yeah  With that awful Boston hat  Rooting against them  Just to show that the  You know we have  The ones up here  The infectious sneezers  I thought the same thing 
[00:39:30]  I was like why are they  They actually showed  Two different Asian couples  It was hard to tell  But they were  I was going to say  No it was the same couple  Hat was tilted to the left  It was almost like  The Highlights magazine  Can you tell the difference  Between these two pictures  It was the same couple  They just put their coats on  Because it was getting  A little colder  That's why you were confused  Hey Ope  Your oatmeal is going to get cold  Yeah I know  I'm trying to eat it  I'm trying to plant my fist  Right in that awful  Tupperware thing of oatmeal  You have in front of you  I want to smash it  All over the console  Ope brings in his own oatmeal

I'll pay them  An extra dollar a month  If they get rid of  Every George Carlin bit  Ever  Yeah we're still  Getting Carlin  We're getting there  We're getting there  Oh my god  It's horrific  Hey I got a question  For old Jimmy Norton  I just got done  My second marriage  I've never been  To a massage parlor  But I'm thinking about it  How do I know  I'm going to get  A happy ending  Oh that's a good question  Because a lot of people  I think they go  To these massage places  And they wind up  Getting a massage  Yeah  Yeah and that's  The last thing I want 
[00:43:00]  Right  How can you want that  He wants to get jacked  If they look like  Matsui's relative  You're going to get  The happy ending  Oh it's a race thing  I had to move to Boston  You can't get a handy  From anything but Asian  Oh sure you can  Just try to see  If it looks like  They're paying off  Some type of a  Smuggling ship death  That's always a good sign  Asians are your  Happy ending leaders  Yeah absolutely  They really are  Followed by what  Jimmy  Would you say  It's hard to say  The neighborhood  I mean some places  It'd be black girls 
[00:43:30]  Some Latino  Some white  I mean it really depends  On where you go  What about the Swedish massage  Do you get the happy ending  With the Swedish massage  Of course you do  If you walk in  And the massage therapist  Are smoking cigarettes  That's a sign  You're going to get jacked  Oh good  Wow I never thought of that  That is a good one  I thought there was a code word  I asked them  If they speak Greek  Or something  The code word is basically  Yeah you're pointing  A mule and go  Will you tug on this  Like the whore that you are  If you ask it  If they're speaking Greek  They're going to strap on a dildo bro  You better stay away from that  If they have shipping container 
[00:44:00]  Lines on their back  That usually means  You'll get a happy ending  If there's a real  If it looks like  A legitimate spa  Forget it  Why would you waste your time  Getting oil everywhere  But your dick  It doesn't look like  A legitimate spa  So I'll give it a shot  Alright  So when are you going  To the massage parlor  I'm thinking of going  Right after work  And why are you going  Because I just got done  My second marriage  And I got old and ugly  I can't get chicks anymore  Oh  Didn't work out for you  That second one 
[00:44:30]  What are you crazy  Why would you get married  A second time  Absolutely stupid  I was stupid  How long  Oh my god  You have no idea guys  She killed me  Is he going to be quiet  For a second  I don't know  Hey dude  How long after your first marriage  Did you get married  It was four years  And it lasted eight months  Oh  And she can get  Spousal support from me  For eight months  I've just finished  Pairing out the first one 
[00:45:00]  So  In December  I'm just getting done  The first one  When did it go horribly wrong  When did you realize  Oh my god  I made the same mistake  I did again  When I was in front of the judge  She goes  You didn't even look at me  You go  You're right  I didn't  Did you have a  Did you have a big second wedding  With all your friends  And the  Nah  I never understand  That the big second wedding  Where people get out there  And you know  They put on the  Frank Sinatra  New York  New York 
[00:45:30]  And play the blow up instruments  And all do the kick line  In their suits  With their friends  And you just look  And going  This is just doomed  I don't go to any wedding now  And not look at them  As they're all happy  And drunk  And kissing  At the clinking glass  Oh  Clink clink clink  Clink clink clink  Oh look at them kiss  And not think  This is doomed  This is just doomed  It was doomed  But  Poor stupid bastard  And little things will tell you  Dude  Little things tell you  That it was doomed  Like a lot of people  If you watch 
[00:46:00]  Scott Peterson's  Wedding videos  You can actually hear people going  Clunk around the head  And throw her in the water  You are so obsessed  With Scott Peterson  Clink clink clink clink  Is he your hero or something  Jesus  No it's just  Here's what I'm obsessed with  The fact that dumb women  Are going to write to him  When he's in jail  I don't think he  And they're going to marry him  Like they married Richard Ramirez  They love him  The chicks  He looks like Ben Affleck  They love him  Meanwhile  I can't get a nice girl  To go out with me  More than once  Yeah and I'm going to 
[00:46:30]  To a massage parlor  In Bethlehem, Pennsylvania  Tonight  How sad is that  That's not bad  Pennsylvania  They got massage parlors  Well you know  I live out in the country  I get to work in  Know what they do in Pennsylvania  I work in Kearney, New Jersey  Where Steve used to work  I'm going right now  To run a truck terminal  Dude you didn't tell me  You were in Pennsylvania  The code word is  Churn the butter  That's for the happy ending  They advertise the  Massage parlors  Right on the highway 
[00:47:00]  When you're going  Through Pennsylvania  Really  On the billboards  Yeah  Oh yeah  Me and Bob Kelly  Spent an hour one night  Off Route 380  Looking for one  Trying to get handies  At 3.30 in the morning  Why don't you just  Turn to each other  Save yourself some money  Alright Bruce  Thank you  Hey guys  I'll check in  I'll check in tomorrow  To let you know what happened  Yeah we need an update  From your massage  Alright  I'll give you an update  That would have been  A much better call  If he would have just  Shut up  Because he had a really  Good thing going there  He was very excited  Very excited to be 
[00:47:30]  He seemed a little excited  On this silly program  And then he makes  Himself a feature  Of tomorrow's show  By going I'll check in tomorrow  And a bunch of  Dumbbells we are  We're like alright  See you tomorrow  Well that's the problem  With the show  It's kind of like  The people's radio show  We have no choice  In the matter  We just don't have  A choice in the matter  I hope he gets  What he wants  Lloyd Arthur commenting  Opie and his plastic  Spoons in bulk  He's definitely single  No no no no  It's not plastic  My friend  It's metal  That's why I was amazed  It's a metal spoon  You would get out  Of the drawer  In your house  With an awful  Little black lacquer handle 
[00:48:00]  I think it's very stylish  I have no problem  Making my own oatmeal  It's not like  I'm cooking a french meal  It's stupid oatmeal  Does it get sticky  Though sitting there  Yeah  Nice cold  Sticky oatmeal  We'll go to break  I'll try to shove  More of this in my face  And that's that  That's awful  Alright  That's something  Dr. Bodden  Should be working on  Ben we need the  Wiffleball bat challenge update  I guess it's gone  Horribly wrong  Now we were so close 
[00:48:30]  To having our first  Wiffleball bat contestant  In here  We had a girl  Come in with a guy  Turns out she was  On her period  So she didn't want  To do it  Hold on  We blew it though  She came here twice  You blew it  The first time she came here  We didn't have enough time  We actually blew her off  I didn't realize  How hot she was  That was pretty stupid of us  We were trying to do  Responsible radio  And give our opinions  On the upcoming election  When we had this hot blonde  Outside  Idiots  That's what I mean  By growing pains  And trying to get the show  Back together 
[00:49:00]  We're still not thinking  That's when I was in Albany  By the way  Oh really?  Yeah  I'm glad I wasn't here  For that disgraceful moment  If you were  We probably would have done it  Because you wouldn't  Have shut up  Until she came in here  I would have put a real  Kibosh on that stupid  Political discussion  But we didn't even know  How hot she was  Until after the show  We never saw her  Until after the show  And I'm like  Oh my god  We could have had this today  So they came back  And then  You can pick up from there  Sorry  She had her period  And when she came back  Brought her in  Thought it was going to happen  She goes  No it's my time  They never want to say it to us 
[00:49:30]  We know the second  They turn to whoever  They came in with  And go  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  We know they got their period  And then we were all like  Oh  She said she's not going to do it  You mean the smell  Didn't give it away  That old gag  Is the low tide in here?  The seagulls were following her  Smells like rust  Dirty penny  Her name was Jackie  Actually it was Jackie and Kevin  Notice Ben said her name was 
[00:50:00]  Was  Yeah notice the was  That means  I mean she's still alive  But that means she's kind of  Dead to the show obviously  Why?  Well we're going to find out here  Then we asked the escorts  When they came in  Oh that's right  And for some reason  They'll take you know  Fifteen hundred bucks  To suck on it for you  But no wiffle ball bat  No it was  The wiffle ball bat thing  Was a little below that  One girl was on her period  I think that's a cop out  I think it's the thing to say  If you don't want to do  The wiffle ball bat challenge  You know can we start something here 
[00:50:30]  We need a lady to  Take one for the team  And just kind of call the show  And let us all know  When the girls are flowing  Because they all sync up  They do  Yeah  It could be a nice public service  We do for everybody out there  Yeah  You know maybe  Maybe we have up  Girls from all different cities  Because they all sync up  And then  They seem to be that way  And then we know that  Okay they're out of the game  For seven days  We could go  You know get some chores done  And then we know  The flow is over  And then we go back to banging  There you go  We know what week 
[00:51:00]  To totally not acknowledge you  That's what I'm trying to say  Yes  Get some chores done  Make some  Anyway  Well some people are into  The crime scene  So go ahead there Ben  The wiffle ball bat challenge update  Well Jackie's dad  Had found out  That Jackie had come  Did he encourage her  To come back  Oh boy  Jackie's dad found out  That she visited this program  And threatened to kill  Her boyfriend Kevin  Because he was afraid  That she'd be having sex  In a place like  St. Patrick's Cathedral  No no no 
[00:51:30]  We wouldn't do that again  And he also wanted to  Let me know  That they wanted to do  Sex for Sam  When we did it the last time  But she wasn't even 21 yet  So she couldn't have won  To go to Boston  Teen sex for Sam  Yeah  Wow you might be  Stepping on my bit  That might be part of  My teen news coming up  Hot teen news  Now the father  Found out about this  Apparently one of the father's  Friends was listening  Oh that's even worse  When the father has to  Find out through a friend  How does the friend  Approach the father  With that subject matter  It was a co-worker too 
[00:52:00]  Oh  Oh so that  It'll never go away  And I'm sure everyone else  In the workplace  Knows about it now  Dads ruin everything  That is embarrassing  How's your  How's your wife  Oh good  Good  Good  Daughter  What's her name  Jackie  Right  It's funny  I thought I heard her  Did she ever have a  Wiffleball bat in her car  I mean I'm not  How do you approach  You keep your mouth shut  You buddinski  You spoiled it  Yes

[01:00:30]  Of the song  Sounded like the same guy  Singing it  Sounded like a Boston fan  It did sound like a Boston fan  Ben from Phoenix  What's up?  Hey what's up?  This is actually Vince  But I'm  Alright  I'm calling  I'm calling because  You know  Little Jim Norton  He's always talking about  How great prostitutes are  Now you're going to talk about  Happy endings  Yes  Well you know  The women  They got their  Whip it out Wednesday  So last Wednesday  I was in Mexico  And I whipped it out  I was with my friend  Right  We went to the  Happy Ending  Which is a  Mexican massage parlor 
[01:01:00]  And I don't know  What  You guys ever go to Mexico?  Never been  No I was in Cancun  But never like a great part of Mexico  No you gotta go to Rocky Point  You gotta go to the slums  That's where the really cheap prostitutes are  I mean I was talking about  Forty five dollars  Full service  It was horrible  It's like Tijuana right?  Kind of like that same vibe  Yes  It's sort of like Tijuana  But it was more like Rocky Point  It's like  It's right over the border  It's like  Out of Arizona  It's right across the border  It's horrible  So anyway  Going to Mexico?  Yeah  Yeah 
[01:01:30]  Oh it was horrible  But I'm getting to that  So I go in there  And the Heidi flight  She's real fat  I go in there  I'm like  What's the deal?  And he goes  Well  It's forty five dollars  And you get  Fifteen minutes massage  And fifteen minutes blow yob  I thought they were going to be like  Use some code words  So it really caught me off  I had to go outside  You know  Collect myself  He said blow yob?  Yeah blow yob  Blow yob  B-L-O-S-L-T  Buck yob  Blow yob  Blow yob  She goes  Fifteen minute messiah  Fifteen minute blow yob 
[01:02:00]  I'm like  What?  Thrapping my fucking balls off  I had to go outside  I had to go outside  And have a couple of cigarettes  But I go back inside  And I guess one of the  Lovely ladies  Had just come back  From you know  Servicing a truck  Or whatever  And she was  She wasn't  She wasn't looking too happy  So I picked her of course  So we go back there  And I thought was the massage bar  First  So you know  I just sort of take my shirt off.  She's like, no, no, the whole thing.  So, I mean, I guess if we were playing, like, male, what's in my pants,  I would have a splintered wood floor.  Right.  Oh, it was horrible.  She puts the condom on. 
[01:02:30]  It was just wrong.  So, Jim Norton, if you ever want to.  Yeah, well, of course.  I'm not going to.  What are you, a rookie?  You're going to throw the bag on?  To me, that's like taking the training wheels when you go and you ride the French Open,  whatever that stupid, faggity bicycle race is called.  The French Open.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  What's that bicycle race?  Tour de France.  Whatever.  Oh, look, we rode more miles today, jerk-offs.  Nice earthquake in the middle of the Tour de France.  Watch old ball cancer fall off a ledge. 
[01:03:00]  He doesn't have the ball cancer anymore.  He beat it.  You know, the constructors, you have to film a tar pit.  I'm going to try to lure my stick into the tar pit.  I'm going to try to get, you know, killed or anything.  So, she puts the bag on.  It's just absolutely horrible.  So, moral story, Jim, if you want some cheap prostitution, 45 bucks, Mexico, it's awesome.  Well, there's actually, in Phoenix, there's actually a dominatrix who I want to urinate on me.  I want to go out to Phoenix, in that area, just to get this one dominatrix.  The dominatrix do nothing for me, man.  Me neither.  Me neither.  I hate that.  But the majority of times, they don't for me either. 
[01:03:30]  Are you talking about the Den of Iniquity?  No, that's run by Porsche Lynn.  I've never been to that one.  He knows everything about this stuff.  He knows everything.  All right.  I've never been to the Den in Phoenix.  Well, I have been to the one in New York.  Jim Norton, bottom line, $45, cheap prostitution.  You'd love it.  Open Anthony, welcome back.  Thanks, Ben.  A long time.  Thanks, Ben.  Ben from Phoenix.  Okay.  I wanted to cut him off because I think we might get a new feature started on the show today.  Oh, stop it.  Let's say hi to Jesse in New York City.  What's up, Jesse? 
[01:04:00]  What's up, guys?  I'm so glad you're back on.  I've been on your show three times for the whipped cream bikini contest.  The naked teen bus, I got arrested for you guys.  Oh, you were on the voyeur bus?  Yes, I got arrested with Jimmy Norton.  Hi.  See, that's when we should have been fired, and I was really pissed off that didn't do the job.  The whole naked teen voyeur bus incident.  We had a whole bunch of teenage girls on a bus, a see-through bus.  I'm trying to remember which one she was.  Which one were you, sweetheart? 
[01:04:30]  The really, really hot ones.  Oh.  There were a lot of hot ones that day, though.  Did you push on one girl who had those big cone nipples?  I think her name was Melanie.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no.  I know that's not.  Her name is Melanie, I think.  No, no.  Were you the tall one?  No, I was like 5'4".  I think I remember you.  You are very attractive.  I came back, and I did the whipped cream bikini contest.  Oh, you're skinny?  Yeah, I got third place.  Yes.  Are you really skinny?  Oh, I think I know who you are.  Yeah, she's very hot, definitely.  And she got arrested for the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was the day we got 13 people arrested. 
[01:05:00]  Huh?  I did the fake orgasm contest, and I won that, too.  She's just been in everything.  Where do you live?  You are a real whorebag.  I love this.  Look at Jim.  Where do you live?  Would you, for a second, think about the show first and not your own sexual friggin' deviancy?  Maybe she can come into the radio program.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's what he's thinking.  Where do you live?  I'm living in a city now.  Oh!  What part of the city? 
[01:05:30]  Fifth Avenue and 39th.  Well, come on down!  Well, come on down.  So, listen, I'm going to do the queef.  I have to go in.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, let's...  So you want to do the queef?  Anthony, do you want to explain this?  We tried to get this going yesterday.  Yeah, we used to do the 6 o'clock queef in the afternoon, early evening.  And then the lawyers got involved with our radio show and made another one of the things  they took away from us.  This is expelling gas that you can, you know, you can suck in air from her vag.  I'm sucking in right now. 
[01:06:00]  And then expel it out into the telephone, and it makes a queefing noise, you know, that  sound.  And you can do this?  Of course.  All girls can.  Like, they just don't know how to tap into that talent.  I guess not.  All right.  You guys ready?  Are we ready, Opie?  Of course we're ready.  Do you want to hear this?  Okay, let's turn off the phone here.  Now, do you have your pants off?  Yes, I do.  Where are you, home?  Yes.  And you have your pants off.  You're a brunette.  Real fast, because this is radio. 
[01:06:30]  I remember you're hot, but give the measurements again.  A brunette, 5'4", 105 pounds, 34B, and what else?  You want to know?  That's lovely.  And what kind of hairstyle?  Just long brown hair.  Really?  No, I think he was talking about the...  You got the Abe Lincoln happening?  Oh, it's all shaven down there.  Completely shaved.  Or the 5 o'clock shadow.  That's how Jimmy likes it.  Completely shaved.  Completely shaved. 
[01:07:00]  Actually, never have been there.  Jimmy likes little girls that don't even have hair.  All right.  No, I don't like little girls.  All right.  Enough with the small talk, Jesse.  Let's hear the...  All right.  I guess it would be the 7 a.m.  queef.  If that didn't sound like a defense, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  I don't like little girls.  Get that on the record.  You're right.  That really...  I am not a crook.  Non-comedic response I gave.  Coming up, we'll do Help the Pedophile.  Did you do it, Jesse, while we were babbling?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought I heard something in the background.  We blew it.  Let's listen closely.  You're going to have to reload, I guess, huh? 
[01:07:30]  That's hot.  You got that?  That is so hot.  Awesome, man.  Let's hear some more, please.  Please?  Just keep doing it.  You want some more?  Yeah, just keep doing it.  We put this to song once.  It was hilarious.  Thank you, guys. 
[01:08:00]  We're looking for a girl with musical talent that could do that and do a little ditty.  It sounds pretty tight.  Yeah, it is.  You know, it didn't have that...  She might be holding the ends.  Oh, like you do with a balloon when you make it whistle for you?  One of those.  Holding the ends.  Okay.  Jesse, one more time here.  One more time.  Oh, my God.  I just want to put my pants on. 
[01:08:30]  Hold on.  Ready?  Oh, you put your pants on?  One more time.  Take your trousers off.  Look.  You like that?  Yeah, we like that.  That's hot.  That's it.  Any other night that I'm awake at this time, I will call you guys and do it.  All right.  Thank you, Jesse.  Thank you guys so much.  Bye, Jesse.  There's an old friend checking in, Anthony.  An old friend.  Bye, miss.  She got arrested for the show and was very excited.  Yes.  I remember all the people coming back from jail, except for Norton. 
[01:09:00]  He was miserable.  You know why?  Because I had a log the size of Cleveland brewing in my intestines, so I had to run to danger  fields and do spots while I had to shit.  We had 12 to 13 people arrested, including our own Jim Norton and Louis Black from The Daily  Show.  Let it be known, Louis Black loves teens.  Ah, who doesn't?  And everyone came back to the station after like 36 hours in the joint, and they were all  very excited that they got arrested for the program.  Yeah.  And that was my induction. 
[01:09:30]  I used to come into the show, but that was the thing after that happened.  O&A both said to me, look, you can come in whenever you want.  Right.  Well, we felt like we owed you.  It was fine.  But no, no.  But what happened is, when something else came up, and somebody else...  I'm sorry for that black guy.  We didn't know that was going to happen.  Yeah, but I was kind of asking for it, you know, the other day with my supple Irish mouth  open, going, I dare you.  Were you all impacted after you...  Oh, you don't understand.  And the thing was, my balls were oniony and foul, and these chicks were having this get  out of jail party, and they invited me to, but I had a gamey bag, and I had to take a 
[01:10:00]  dump, and I just went home after my spots.  Oh, you left.  And shit and showered and smoked.  Was there one of those, just the toilets in the cell without any walls or anything?  Roaches on it.  Roaches on it.  So you couldn't take a dump?  Not even close.  No, no.  But what I was saying is, these guys, you know, the city was so pissed off at us and this  warrior bus incident because they took it out on them.  The president was involved that, yeah, they took it out on our guys and put them in the  tomb.  This is Jesse?  The tombs.  No, no. 
[01:10:30]  We're still trying to figure out more phones.  No, that's the blonde.  Wow.  I love that brunette with those big cone nipples.  God, she turned me on so much.  Well, that's Jackie the knife girl.  Oh, yeah, Jackie.  Yeah, we got to get Jackie the knife girl to do the knife thing again.  Yeah.  But anyway, go ahead.  See, that was my, like, real induction into the show.  So I remember when certain other things were happening at the end of the last run at  NEW and somebody else was facing the police and getting arrested, I knew what was going  on.  You understand what I mean?  Like, I knew it was just to get, hey, I want that kind of, you know, yeah. 
[01:11:00]  That's the girl that just did the queef?  I remember her.  Holy S.  The one on the, uh, right next to Jackie on the right there?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She was the hottest one in the bus.  She was definitely the hottest one in the bus.  Very nice.  Remember we got the police escort from that guy?  From that guy, from that cop, Anthony?  Yeah.  And he was taking pictures and we thought everything was okay and then all of a sudden everything  went horribly wrong.  I think we have an update on that cop and, uh, it's kind of a, not a great story here.  Let's go to Greg in the city. 
[01:11:30]  I didn't sound like he was shot in the line of duty.  Hey, Greg.  Hey, how are you?  All right.  Okay, um, I just wanted to let you guys know I'm a long-time listener also, I'm not going  to waste your time, but, uh, I'm a New York City cop for seven years and, uh, one of the  cops that escorted the team bus around there, it was an unauthorized escort basically, and  when it was all shut down, they actually ended up suspending that cop who was on a scooter  for 30 days, no pay, no nothing, and then transferred him out of where he was, all because he  tried to help you guys out.  But I gotta just say, for the record, that, uh, he did a good job and, uh, 
[01:12:00]  he ended up back and everything was all right.  Oh, good, good, good.  All right, very good.  I, I, I've worried about that guy for a while because we felt really bad.  Yeah, he was basically keeping people back and kind of protecting people from getting  run over by the bus.  And taking a lot of really good pictures for his personal collection.  Of course.  Right, and that, that, that's how they rewarded, that's how they reward the cops, by doing  something, you know, doing something good to try to help everybody out and have a good  time.  Everybody had a good time, but, uh, he got, he got to our end.  Anyway, good show.  Thank you for, uh, taking the call.  All right.  Thanks, Greg.  Thanks, man.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Doing something. 
[01:12:30]  Let's, you know, let's, uh, let's be a little realistic there.  I think he wanted the view also.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I mean, I'm sorry that happened.  You know, anybody that gets fired because of this show, unless they're involved in the show,  usually winds up getting pretty screwed, you know, we wind up, we wind up bouncing back  somehow, but the peripheral people usually wind up taking it.  Yeah.  Eating it.  Wow.  My teen news is really building up here for the teen, the hot teen news segment.  More hot teen news?  Why a stack of hot teen news over there.  I'll say he does. 
[01:13:00]  I've got four or five stories to get to today.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Finally, we can take a break, I guess.  Yeah.  Did you find the turn it off, turn it off for the next time?  Yeah, it's, it's, it's on here.  It's, it's one of my favorite scenes from the movie Hardcore with George C. Scott when  he's sitting in that movie theater and, uh, he's trying to find his runaway daughter and  he sits down and the private investigator that he's hired, uh, shows him this film and  the film is a daughter of hardcore pornography, a film of hardcore pornography starring his 
[01:13:30]  daughter.  His little girl is just sucking it and at the same time taking it right up the keister and  he's sitting there.  Hey, let's, uh, maybe we save it.  A little surprise from when the show's going hardly wrong.  Are you teasing?  We're going to tease one of your little sound bites over there.  You're teasing a sound bite?  Sure, why not?  All right, as we go to break, a little, uh, prank call that I did.  Telemarketer called my house and I just kind of did a little something and, uh, and we'll  return after this.  Hello, this is Robbie Cross and I'm calling you because Chase Manhattan Bank USA, your 
[01:14:00]  Visa MasterCard company, is offering you a no-cost three-month trial period for accidental  death insurance of up to $1 million accidental death insurance for accidents involving transportation.  Whoa!  Wait, whoa, whoa.  Accidental death insurance?  Yes.  For accidents involving public transportation with...  Whoa, wait.  Hey, this is good stuff.  I was, uh, thinking of killing myself, actually.  So my, my family, this would be good for my family.  So all I have to do is, um, you know, uh, make it an accident and they'll collect? 
[01:14:30]  I guess so.  Really?  No, I'm totally serious.  Okay.  So let's say I just go out on the street and I just put my head under, like, a public,  uh, uh, bus.  In which I hope you wouldn't do that, but...  I, I really don't want to live anymore and I just want my family, uh, taken care of.  So this is very exciting.  Very exciting.  All right.  So how much money can I make if I, like, put my head under a bus?  It's covered up to, you're covered up to $1 million, sir.  Oh, trust me.  I'll make it look like an accident. 
[01:15:00]  I mean, it's snowing up here now.  I'll just slide under a damn bus.  It'll be quick and easy.  Are you an authorized user of this car?  Yes.  Okay.  Can't you hear the excitement in my voice?  I can finally take care of my family.  Now, here's how the offer works.  Just before your three-month trial period is over, we'll send you a reminder of the coverage  so you can decide if you want to get...  Wait a minute.  All I need to know is when, when is this active so I can end my life?  Um, after, it's a three-month trial period.  So three months from now I could, I could put my head under a bus? 
[01:15:30]  That's up to you, sir.  Wow.  And get a million dollars for my family?  Yes, sir.  Nice.  If you decide to continue the premium, which is $9.95...  Wait, wait.  ...bill to you...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  After three months it's all over, so why would I have to continue with premiums?  You don't understand, but if I, if this is a real deal, I'm, I'm out of here in three months.  Go on.  Go on.  That's up to you, sir.  Now, let's say I jump in front of a train.  Will that be covered?  It's public, um, it's an automobile accident, sir. 
[01:16:00]  So I'll be covered?  I guess so.  Do you think it's easier to jump in front of a train or let a bus run over your head?  Whichever one you prefer.  I would rather get it over quickly.  I'm thinking the train going really fast would, would do the deal.  Okay, sir.  I'll need to know who will be the primary insurer for your coverage.  I mean, you think my head would be just smashed hard?  No.  Hello?  Okay, how's your wire on?  Hello?  Don't worry about it, no.  Okay.  That's not insistent.  No. 
[01:16:30]  Forget it.  He's moving me.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  The only way you're getting a date is with a bottle of chloroform.  Let's talk about the differences between frogs and bears.  Like, when there's a frog around, I don't have to hang my fucking sandwiches from a branch.  A frog knows they are for me.  He'd rather have a fly.  Because a fly zigzags.  And my sandwiches do not.  Unless I go like this. 
[01:17:00]  If I want some honey on some toast, I don't have to squeeze a plastic frog.  Alcoholism is a disease, but it's the only disease that you can get yelled at for having.  Goddamn, Otto, you're an alcoholic.  Goddamn, Otto, you have lupus.  One of those two doesn't sound right. 
[01:17:30]  If you have to release bad news to the public, it will help if you are not ugly.  I have a loose neck shirt. 
[01:18:00]  Because my neck is fragile.  I can't wear a regular shirt.  It hurts.  Especially turtlenecks.  I wear a turtleneck.  It's like being strangled by a really weak guy.  All fucking day.  If you wear a turtleneck in a backpack, it's like a weak midget trying to bring you down.  Let's see you here, man. 
[01:18:30]  I have two sisters.  One of them is named Wendy.  If you ask Wendy if I was weird, she'd probably say yeah.  But that's fucked up.  Because she's weird.  Because she has a husband and two children.  And they have a family photo on top of their VCR.  Well, they're all looking slightly to the left.  As though something's going on over there.  The camera is right in front of you.  But I guess something happened to the left.  That made everybody happy. 
[01:19:00]  So my sister is cross-eyed so she can't quite pull it off.  One eye is right the fuck on.  You know they advertise a casino on a billboard.  They always show a picture of a guy winning money.  But that's false advertising.  Because that's what happens the least.  Perhaps when they advertise a hamburger, they could show a guy choking. 
[01:19:30]  This is what happened once.  It's everything.  XM 202.  XM News, Talk Sports, and Information.  24-7.  Opie and Anthony.  They jerked off to the Olsen twins. 
[01:20:00]  Before they were legal.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Everything you say to me.  To be one step, one day.  And I'm about to break.  I need a little room to break.  To be one step, one day.  And I'm about to break.  Go check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  On the way, we're going to do a cute little bit called the 50 Worst Songs Ever, Anthony. 
[01:20:30]  How cute.  Also, help the pedophile.  Probably very, very soon we'll do that for some folks out there, okay?  But you got a crazy story.  A woman scorned in the New York area did something pretty outrageous.  Woman scorned, Opie.  Woman scorned.  You know, there's been swastikas popping up around the city.  And people never know who to blame the swastikas on.  Well, this time, it was a woman scorned.  It seems an emotionally disturbed woman went on a three-day anti-Semitic rampage painting swastikas in Jewish neighborhoods 
[01:21:00]  because she was furious that her ex-husband married a Jewish woman 14 years younger than her.  She was 14 years younger.  Ouch!  20 locations in Brooklyn and Queens have been hit since Friday,  but cops put the case together after the woman's ex-husband reported a swastik on his car parked in front of his Ozone Park home.  I think that gave it away right there, huh?  Who was doing the swastik thing? 
[01:21:30]  Parise.  Police arrested the ex-wife.  Olga Abramovich?  That sounds kind of Jewish, that last name.  49 of Bay Ridge.  Hey, my old neighborhood.  A can of white spray paint the same color as the swastikas was in her trunk.  She was charged with criminal mischief.  Oh, she's Russian Orthodox.  Gotcha.  Went around painting swastikas. 
[01:22:00]  Because she's pissed off.  Her husband was cheating.  Well, remarried.  Married a Jewish woman 14 years younger.  What was she, 49?  So, 39.  35.  35.  Oh, that's far from teen.  Not even close.  But, man, that's, you know, a woman scorned, Opie.  I'm sure there's some stories out there.  They do things.  Yep.  They don't just, they rarely, let's say, just sit back and go, okay, my hubby ran off with 
[01:22:30]  another chick.  With a hot piece of ass.  With a hot piece of ass.  Younger than me.  I guess I could accept that.  I'm going to move on.  I'll move on.  I'll take the high road.  And get my life back together.  Never happens.  Maybe get a little secretary job somewhere.  Whether it's something small, like flattening the husband's tires, or running him over repeatedly  in your SUV. 
[01:23:00]  Remember that case?  Oh, Jesus.  Circle.  She just drove over.  She just kept driving around and running him over.  Or, that is pissed off.  That is a woman scorned.  They can't take it.  They freak out.  Which, you know, you can't blame them.  But, uh, it's, it's, they will always do something.  Always do something.  And this woman figured, uh, she was Jewish.  She actually had a theme to it, you know.  The girl was Jewish.  So, paint the swastikas. 
[01:23:30]  And she painted them all around, uh, Queens and Brooklyn.  That was really, really smart.  What's Ben doing?  Oh, he's changing the channel.  Thank you, Ben.  Mm-hmm.  Atta boy, Ben.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  What?  Nothing.  Nothing, man.  We just watch your every move, especially when you're sleepy.  You're fun that way.  I'm not quite awake.  I'm quite awake.  Yeah, coffee does the trick.  I'm alright.  I could use another cup of coffee today.  Considering we all stayed up.  Cup of Joe. 
[01:24:00]  Cup of Joe.  That Red Sox game killed us again.  You want some coffee for your coagulating breakfast?  Dude, we watched a guy that had no game.  I wanted to bring that up.  No game.  Let's bring that.  In between innings, we ran down to the corner to get some, you know, burritos or whatever.  And, you know, some dinner, right?  Do a little takeout action.  And there's this hot blonde at this joint, at the bar with her fat friend.  The blonde is shit-faced.  Really fat friend.  The cock blocker.  Uh, yes.  Yes.  And, um, the blonde had a few margaritas. 
[01:24:30]  She was, she was just snoted, man.  And she's going to a big black, uh, big black.  Why did I say big black?  Because you're a racist.  No, I'm not.  A big fat friend.  Right?  Yeah.  And go, and as loud as she can in the bar.  She's like, know what you need?  You need dick.  You need a big fat dick.  Wait, wait.  The fat one was saying that to the hot one?  No, the hot blonde.  Was saying that to, yeah, to the fat one?  We need to find you some dick. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, God.  Just out of her mind.  So all the guys in the place turned right to this blonde, of course.  Like, hey, you're a goer.  Right on.  So then this guy at the bar tries to start a rap with her, and he had, he had nothing.  Awful.  Hey, what's your name?  We heard the whole thing.  Hey, what's your name?  Come here often.  He did say that.  From around here?  He goes, you come here often?  She's like, yeah, pretty much every day.  So then, you know, all of a sudden he goes, what's your name?  And she says, whatever, you know.  And all of a sudden, why don't you stay and have a drink? 
[01:25:30]  And she goes, no, I have to go to rehearsal?  I have to go to rehearsal.  What the hell was she rehearsing?  Six o'clock at night.  Oh, another actress.  Completely hammered.  Another fake actress.  Are you rehearsing for your latest porn video?  And you were just getting, you know, sauced up?  With her fat friend?  Big fat friend.  God, they travel like that.  It's amazing.  They love a big hoagie eater next to them at all times.  Like the hot one and then the pachyderm that carries her stuff.  Well, Stephen Lynch has a great song about that that maybe we could play today. 
[01:26:00]  But, yeah, go ahead, Ben.  What?  What?  Huh?  What, Ben?  Is everything all right?  Ben?  It's fine.  Steve's bringing the CD.  Of what?  The big fat friend?  Oh, it's underlit.  Oh, all right.  What?  The big fat friend?  It's underlit, then.  Oh, really?  We have nothing going on right this second.  So why don't we play Stephen Lynch's big fat friend in honor of this little stupid little,  you know, scene we checked out last night.  I'm going to bring a friend of mine to the stage.  Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Tite. 
[01:26:30]  We're going to do a couple songs for you.  Wow.  Thank you for that smattering of applause.  What a great crowd.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to mess up your seating right there, sir.  It's all captured on tape.  Yep.  This is a song for the guys.  She got a smile, yeah, she got a smile, and she's flashing it right at me. 
[01:27:00]  She got a wink, a wink across the bar, and I know that it's meant to be.  She got a walk, ooh, she walking over, and I know it could be my day.  She got a friend, ooh, she's got a friend.  While she's standing in her way, it's a big fat friend.  Oh, God, there's always one. 
[01:27:30]  Big fat friend.  To spoil my fucking fun.  Now, baby, baby, baby, if it's boots you want to knock, leave your chubbly friend at home because she's gonna block the car.  Now, I'm afraid of no man with any I'll contend, but I cannot compete with your big fat friend.  So, big fat friend, ah, we meet again. 
[01:28:00]  You won't leave her alone.  You'll roll your eyes, make sarcastic comments while you're sucking on that chicken bone.  But that's okay.  You think you won the battle, but I tend to disagree.  See, I know you and your Achilles heel, and he's standing next to me, my non-discriminating friend. 
[01:28:30]  So, what's that your account?  Non-discriminating friend.  I'll nail you anyhow.  I know that he's no looker, and he's had a couple rounds.  But with every shot of Jaeger, hey, you lose a couple pounds.  Now, baby, baby, baby, bring the evening to an end.  Just you and me and my pal. 
[01:29:00]  And your big fat friend.  Steven Lynch with his buddy Tyke and big fat friend.  They were supposed to play that live today on the show, but they're not morning guys.  They're going to come back and do some duets for us in a few weeks, right?  A couple weeks?  All right, very good.  It's the Opie and Anthony show, the ONA virus.  Yeah, Anthony was reminding me of something when he was telling that swastika story.  Yeah.  Well, my story's not a woman's scorn, though. 
[01:29:30]  It's a bizarre story.  It sounded like a woman's scorn.  What else would do that?  When I was living in Buffalo doing this fine radio program by myself, being quite successful  by myself doing overnight radio in god-awful Buffalo, when we're up there, I've got to  make believe I loved my time up there.  I hated it.  Did you have another name, by the way, when you were up there?  No, not at all.  Not at all, no, no, no, not really, no.  Was it Spud's Buckley?  No, no, not really.  It was, no.  A lot of people might not be familiar with Spud's Buckley, and I felt it would be a good 
[01:30:00]  time to introduce.  It wasn't my name.  It was a little, uh...  I did caricatures back then.  I did caricatures.  Kind of like a whole little, like, montage of different fun friends you'd introduce to  the radio program?  I did a few characters for a morning show up there, yes, and one of them was called Spud's  Buckley.  Yes, you're right.  But there's no tape that exists of me doing Spud's Buckley.  Mr. Amos does caricatures.  You know, I know the faithful listeners of this fine radio show are trying to hunt down  some tape of me doing Spud's Buckley.  It just doesn't exist out there. 
[01:30:30]  I'm sorry.  What did you do with Spud's Buckley?  I know there's been a Google search going on for years, but it just doesn't exist.  Me doing the Spud's Buckley caricature.  Damn.  Well, I've heard of this Spud's Buckley.  You know, it's been so long, I couldn't even really reenact it.  I really don't remember much.  Well, what would Spud's wear?  I don't remember anything, and there's really no pictures that exist, God, I hope not, of  me in my Spud's Buckley gear.  Spud's wear. 
[01:31:00]  Hey, man, I paved the road for you guys.  Help me out here.  Who?  I had to do that.  I'm the innovator.  I was Spud's Buckley first, Robin.  Someone in this room had to go out there and do the bad radio to get all this together.  Come on, help me out, guys.  Jesus.  I was the typical radio guy where I had to pump the dollar two gas in the afternoon for  all the fat housewives that came by for their little rose because their husbands wouldn't  buy them anything on Valentine's Day.  Yeah, I was that guy.  I did the bar gigs. 
[01:31:30]  They once had an opie lookalike contest when I was working on Long Island.  I was that guy that did.  I remember those flyers.  One was stuck under my windshield wiper when I was at some bar out on Long Island.  Some rock club?  This was years before I ever even met open.  Can I explain?  Because I know I'm going to get killed here.  I was always fighting the system, though.  I wasn't accepting the fact that I had to do all this bad radio.  But when you're just getting started in this business, you can't tell your bosses to go  fuck themselves.  No, you need some pull first.  You've got to wait until you're syndicated in 20 cities, and then you tell them to go fuck themselves. 
[01:32:00]  So you've got to go to the Exxon in Ronkonkoma and pump some gas.  Did you really fight the system, though?  You said, no Spuds Buckley.  I'm S to the B.  That seemed like a good idea at the time.  I was also very, very drunk most of the time when I was in Buffalo.  Nice.  I was a stuttering fool back then.  Much like everyone in Buffalo.  Thanks to the JÃ¤germeister.  Oh.  The Black Death.  Good stuff.  Go ahead.  The OPE lookalike contest, yes.  Yeah, I remember seeing the flyer under my windshield. 
[01:32:30]  They had plastered this.  This was a brilliant idea when I was working at WBAB on Long Island.  They thought it would be great to have an OPE lookalike contest because, you know what?  Because people see pictures when they're listening to their radio.  Yeah, exactly.  They know what you look like.  Exactly.  Well, they put some picture of you on the flyer.  This was years, years before I even met you.  I do have that flyer, by the way.  You do?  I should give it to Steve to put on FoundryMusic.com.  It is god-awful.  I come out of, I guess it was Chevy's? 
[01:33:00]  I don't know.  It was.  It was Chevy's out there on Long Island.  It wasn't Hammerheads?  It used to be Hammerheads, yeah.  Oh, it was?  Okay.  And then I changed it to Chevy's, and I was walking out of the place, and I'm like, what's  this crap?  This is before you and I met?  I had no clue even who you were.  I think you had just started.  What did you think?  So I was listening to Bob Grant.  I hadn't even heard your show yet.  All right.  So you had to look at this thing and go, what a dick.  As a matter of fact, I pulled it out.  I said something to the effect of, what the fuck is this crap? 
[01:33:30]  Crumbled it up and threw it on the ground.  It was like, it wasn't even an issue.  There you go.  There was your future partner, paving away.  And I had no clue.  I had no clue.  Working his way up in the minor leagues, and you just crumbled up.  Tossed to the waistline.  And just threw it in the gutter.  There he is.  There's my pal that I now do radio with.  Thank you.  Like some flotsam and jetsam.  Jesus.  Did you ever think you'd be watching that same fella eat homemade oatmeal? 
[01:34:00]  If only I had saved that flyer, I could have put it up on eBay for hundreds of dollars.  No, I got it.  I'll bring it in.  And I'll give it to Steve.  I want to see that.  I'm sure I'll remember it fondly.  I'll bring it in.  It's on Long Island.  And if I could get back in that house, I'll get it.  Why can't you get back in?  No, I could get back in my house.  You still live there, don't you?  Sort of.  It's a little joke, yes.  But anyway.  Okay.  It's in the basement.  Trouble?  Trouble?  It's in the basement.  I think one of the windows is a jar.  Trouble in paradise?  Hey, I know that trick.  I think the window's a jar. 
[01:34:30]  I think I could get my BAB stuff out.  I squeezed through a window that was about eight inches wide by about 12 inches high.  And I had to break the rear window of the house.  This was when you were officially still married and you wanted your stuff.  This is when I was officially married, but I had left the house because her lawyer, Dominic  Barber, had told me to leave the house.  So I wanted my stuff because I saw what direction this was going in and I realized I was going 
[01:35:00]  to walk away from this with absolutely nothing.  And I wanted a couple of things.  And boy, did you have a lot of stuff back then.  I had nothing.  That's what I'm saying.  You had a few radio station t-shirts and a nice computer.  That was about it.  That was it.  And I went in and got my computer.  That was it.  And then I found out later that everything else went in the fire.  Went in the fireplace.  The fire?  A fireplace.  You talk about a woman scorn.  She burned your stuff?  She lit up a fire in the fireplace. 
[01:35:30]  Took all of my pictures.  And that picture's us.  I don't care if you burn those, but it was like pictures of when I was a kid and stuff.  Burnt all that.  Burnt my clothes.  Took some of my clothes and gave them to the homeless.  So there's like WAAF when we were up there in Massachusetts.  WAAF shirts on homeless guys walking around Huntington.  Wearing my stuff.  My jackets.  My radio station jacket.  AAF was my first job up in radio full time. 
[01:36:00]  Sort of.  We did a little BAB.  A little BAB, but it was really my first paying job where I was full time in radio.  And they gave me a jacket and everything with AAF, the call letters on the back.  And I always thought that was pretty cool, you know, to be in radio and have the station with the call letters.  Like, you know, like you were one of the warriors, you know.  I'm one of the warriors.  I'm going to put on roller skates or a Yankee outfit and white paint on my face and hit people over the head with bats.  Spud!  Spud!  Spud!  Spud!  Spud!  Spud!  Spud! 
[01:36:30]  Come out and play!  The tape doesn't exist.  They killed Spud's Buckley!  I saw it!  It was the warriors!  Why did you smack Spud's Buckley's glasses off?  I like doing things like that!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Jesus.  Anyway, Anthony, yes.  So the homeless were wearing your stuff.  Yeah.  And the rest of it was going up in flames in the fireplace. 
[01:37:00]  Was burnt.  So I had to get in there and I took out my computer.  But yeah, well, that was a scorn.  I remember the day we were trying to figure out how to break in your house and stuff.  Yeah.  There was a whole thing that was going on and you told me the night you were going in and all that.  There was a back door and, you know.  Did I help you out?  I found out if she wasn't going to be.  Yeah, you did a little recon.  I did the recon for you.  I had a forward recon to tell me when she wasn't going to be home.  And then I had to go to the back and I put a towel around my arm and hit the window with the elbow. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  Had to go in.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Grabbed my computer.  See, that would be good.  The Mission Impossible music.  And left.  See, the show still needs to build here.  That's all right.  Now it's too late.  Don't even bother.  Yeah.  You had the towel on the arm.  Good thing you didn't see her in the hallway and shoot her.  The towel would have caught on fire.  Unscrew the light bulb in the hallway.  Yeah, that was definitely a scornage.  And then you had done the forward recon to say she wasn't going to be home. 
[01:38:00]  I ran in there.  I was rushing around like a madman trying to get my stuff out of there.  Just paranoid looking at every car pulling up.  I found out later she was gone for the whole weekend.  I could have slept, woke up, got more stuff, taken everything.  Oh, but you had a better place to be.  Why would you want to sleep in that house?  That's true.  Yes, I did.  You should have left a log on the pillow.  That would have been a nice little forget-me-not.  Forget-me-not.  The log on the pillow.  All I left was a log on the pillow. 
[01:38:30]  A little stinky memory of me.  Logs on your pillow.  Pain in your heart.  So I was up in Buffalo doing the radio thing, and I was seeing this young lady.  Young lady?  I hope she's dead now.  Oh, boy.  Bring her up.  I'd like to meet her.  And she was really hot.  I mean, most of the girls up in Buffalo, we call them Buffalo Bettys for a reason. 
[01:39:00]  They're just awful.  They're absolutely awful.  Well, they need that layer of blubber to protect against the cold Buffalo winters.  They're called Buffalo Bettys up in Buffalo.  They wear the long sweatshirts we were talking about yesterday, usually some stretchy pants.  And their hair is...  They're still living like it's 1987.  Their hair does that peacock thing.  Bayshore, Long Island hair.  With a...  Spray that hairspray.  Yeah, so we called them Buffalo Bettys, but I found one that wasn't really a Buffalo Betty. 
[01:39:30]  Quick comment on Buffalo, Opie.  We had gone up there recently.  The last time we were up there, and the only other time I was in Buffalo was when we did the beach party thing.  That turned out to be a great party.  Another disaster.  Another Opie and Anthony disaster.  Nude women having sex with each other and zucchinis on a public beach.  In front of 5,000 of our fans.  Yeah, that's always a good idea.  And families that were out on the beach because they didn't close the beach for some reason.  Right, right, right, right.  So that was really the only exposure I had to Buffalo.  So I thought Buffalo was, like, pretty cool. 
[01:40:00]  And I love our Buffalo listeners, don't get me wrong.  But Buffalo stinks.  That city itself?  Horrific.  What an awful city.  It was, uh...  It was decrepit.  It really was.  And you had to live there?  I lived there for three years.  Doing overnight radio.  No wonder you drank.  I drank like a fish back then.  Even the people have that awful rock salt white on them.  Everything is just eroded by rock salt.  It looks like a city that had been through maybe a nuclear war and no one was left. 
[01:40:30]  So time and erosion had been working.  It's magic on it.  That's what it looked like.  Nothing new.  All dingy.  Everything breaking down.  Opie gave us the tour.  Me, Steve, and Club Soda Kenney gave us the tour of where Opie lived in Buffalo and where  the radio station was.  Oh, yeah, but it was...  Where Spuds Buckley was thawed up.  No, but it was the best tour because I showed them the radio station, which was a haunted 
[01:41:00]  house on Franklin Street.  I saw things there.  It might have been because of lack of sleep and my drinking and drugs and everything else  and the girls that would come up after the bars closed and I would bang them on tape for  the morning guy.  On tape?  Oh, yeah.  And the morning guy would listen?  Oh, yeah.  I was out of my mind back then.  Oh, yeah.  It was the bear man who's back in Allentown.  The bear man.  He's like the king of Allentown radio, yes.  Wow.  But for a while, he was...  Pretty impressive.  But for a while, he was the big morning guy in Buffalo. 
[01:41:30]  And that's where I...  They played a whistle from Billy Joel's song.  Boop.  Oh, yeah, they do.  Clank.  He really is a great guy.  And that's where I did some characters for his morning show, trying to cut my teeth in  the business.  Yeah.  And bear man was married with a couple kids.  He was just a bear of a guy, duh.  He was like 6'4", 6'5", at least 400 pounds.  Just massive, right?  And I was just a young little stud banging the Buffalo Bettys. 
[01:42:00]  Crinkle, crinkle.  You know, the drinks made the Buffalo Bettys look like a little better.  Mm-hmm.  Looked like fives instead of three and a halves.  Usually works.  And I had a regular girl that would come down after the bars closed, and she would take  a cab to the radio station because she had no money.  And she would do all sorts of things.  And I'd have, like, the board op from the AM station, you know, do my show for me.  I would, like, I would tape breaks, like, here's Van Halen on the Fox, the home of rock  and roll in Buffalo.  Home of rock and roll. 
[01:42:30]  You never hear that one.  I'll be back after another 20 minutes of music.  Here's Led Zeppelin.  So I would tape all that, and the AM guy would put it all together, play the songs, and play  my breaks.  And I would go in the production room with this, hoo-ah, and put it all on tape, and then  play it back for the morning guy.  This was my end.  And this actually helped me, you know, get a little higher in this stupid radio world.  Ah.  Because I was trying to get this guy to notice me.  I was just a stupid overnight guy.  Like, who cares?  You know, morning guys don't acknowledge the overnight guy when you're in this radio thing. 
[01:43:00]  Sure.  So I'm like, hmm, how can I get his attention, you know?  And he saw that I was, like, just, you know, just out of control with the women and stuff.  So I started, you know, taping it for him, and then I would play it, you know, for him  when he was preparing for his radio show.  And that helped me get in a little better.  Helped you along.  Oh, yeah.  And then he started getting into work really early, because he wanted to hear the latest  sexcapade that I had on tape for him.  Ah.  Yeah.  So, anyway, so I was in Buffalo, and I started dating this girl, and she was really, really 
[01:43:30]  hot, but she was a psychopath.  And, of course, all us guys, we just love, you know, going after the personality in a woman.  Crazy women.  Well, there was a bunch of people that, women that I could have, you know, dated that had  nice personalities, but, you know, they were awful looking.  But this girl was, like, literally could have been a Playboy model, but she was a psycho  bitch.  But I'm like, you know, psycho factor, who cares?  Guys go for the psycho girls.  I could get over that.  I could get over that.  Guys really do go for psycho girls.  There's something, oh. 
[01:44:00]  Go ahead, go ahead.  I said there's something very sexy about a girl who will, like, look at a picture of  a certain uncle and then just shiver and cry into a pillow.  There's something attractive about that.  So, the relationship goes horribly wrong because she had this boyfriend that was a coke addict  still in the picture, even though she told me that the guy wasn't in the picture.  One of those things, right?  And we finally, you know, I finally just had enough.  You know, she keeps telling me she's not seeing the guy, not seeing the guy, and I just knew  she was seeing the guy.  So, we broke it off, and I started. 
[01:44:30]  So, is this an opie scorned?  Yeah, that's why it's not, that's why I didn't really bring it up on, you know, but then  you reminded me of this.  So, then I started dating other women, and this is where it gets fucked up.  She didn't want me at all, but she didn't want me going out with anybody else.  Ah, classic lunatic.  And it's a very small, it's a very.  I love that gag.  It's a very small city, and Allen Street was where all the bars were at the time, and,  you know, some word got around that I'm, you know, kind of back on the scene banging  broads, right?  Playing the field. 
[01:45:00]  Playing the field.  And I can't have you, no one will.  And back then, it wasn't my choice.  I really wanted this girl, but I was like, all right, what am I going to do?  She doesn't want me.  So, then she found out, so she proceeds to, while I was down on Long Island interviewing  for WBAB, where Anthony and I eventually would meet, I got the job to do nights, but while  I was down interviewing and stuff, she proceeded to leave 20 messages on my answer machine of  her blowing her boyfriend, the coke addict, blowing, blowing, blowing.  It starts actually with a, I have this tape somewhere, and I used to play it on the radio, 
[01:45:30]  and I cannot find it, and it bothers me, and I have boxes and boxes of radio stuff.  Eventually, I'll find it.  Because that would be the best.  But she's on tape just moaning and using a vibrator on herself over and over again, and  she's drunk.  It sounds like she's on some kind of drugs and stuff, and I'm like, holy crap, I'm thinking  this is really hot.  Was she a teen?  Uh, no, like 22 or whatever.  So, it was really hot, but then all of a sudden, it went drastically wrong, because I really 
[01:46:00]  fell for this girl.  I really liked her right here in the heart, okay?  So, all of a sudden, she goes, guess who's here?  And she's moaning.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  And all of a sudden, she goes, Randy, why don't you say hi?  Puts the phone down, and he's in the middle of, you know, doing his thing, and, you know.  Oh, hello, hello, hello.  And you had real feelings for this girl?  Oh, it destroyed me.  My heart just freaking right to the ground.  Oh, you don't want to hear that.  Boom.  So, I'm not kidding.  It was at least 20 messages over and over again.  It was an all-night session. 
[01:46:30]  These two were going at it.  I heard them, you know, screwing, sucking.  It was everything.  Oh, you listened?  I listened to every single one of them, yeah.  Why?  Well, what are you going to do?  It's there, you know?  So, then I'm a radio guy, obviously, so I take the tape into the radio station,  and I made a greatest hits of the 20 phone calls, and then proceeded to put it on her  mom's answer machine, her grandfather's answer machine.  She lost her father, so the grandfather was the father figure, and the grandfather thought, 
[01:47:00]  oh, my girl never does anything wrong.  So, I had to straighten him up.  I put it on his answer machine, and the mother, who just hated this coke addict ex-boyfriend  of hers, thinking that she moved on and stuff, oh, no, put it on her machine.  And then I proceeded to play it on Valentine's Day every day, every year after that, for  many, many years, on the radio, on the radio.  Nice.  Whatever happened?  You never talked to her again?  She, honestly, she calls me, like, every, like... 
[01:47:30]  Stop, still?  Every two years, yeah.  Still?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she's a psycho broad.  You gotta have her on one day.  How great is she?  Oh, my God.  That's crazy.  I haven't, honestly, I haven't heard from her in at least, I don't even know, maybe three  years now, but...  She's great.  Actually, the last time she called my mom's house, trying to find me, because, you know,  in radio, you move around a lot, you get this, you get that, and my mom, my stupid mom,  freaking gives her the phone number, so now I'm just waiting for the next phone call from  this broad, so... 
[01:48:00]  Do you still have feelings for her?  No, not at all.  Honestly, not at all.  At the time, without a doubt, when I was playing those things, I was like, oh, it was the worst.  Without a doubt, devastated is the worst.  But can you blame her, though?  I mean, look, this guy, Coke out, he's obviously banging her all night, she's having fun, he's  partying, you're running around with glasses, wonder if the bear will like this one.  Little rose in your head.  Oh, no, I know.  I was definitely awful.  She had Rick James stories and stuff, because Rick James was in Buffalo.  Supposedly...  You don't want to go near a girl with a Rick James story. 
[01:48:30]  Wow.  Yeah, supposedly, because she was like a little party girl in Buffalo, and supposedly she  did some time with Rick James.  How'd you get her off?  Put your foot in and do jumping jacks?  She was a real trooper, though, man.  I mean, she was the type of girl you'd pull off on the side of the highway and ride on the  hood of the car, right at the rest stop.  This girl loved to just go at it.  She would bring me to the peep boots, and she'd be the only woman there.  Peep shows, yeah.  Peep shows. 
[01:49:00]  This was a date.  She drags me into the peep booth, and she has the cores, puts the cores in, gets the  hardcore porn going, and it was the half doors, and get right on her knees and just go at  it.  And all the guys, you know, all these pervs are in the main room, just all, you know,  checking out this girl on her knees.  She sounds a little too wild.  Only that didn't last.  Yeah, she sounds a little too wild for the young, naive Opie from Long Island.  I was naive.  I mean, she was way ahead of me.  Yeah.  Way ahead of me.  Where'd you meet your girl?  Well, she was kneeling in male slop while giving me a Hummer in a peep show, and our eyes 
[01:49:30]  locked.  She was way ahead of me.  That is the truth, man.  That thing probably slid up, and people were thinking, well, how much did he pay for that  booth?  Yeah.  There's a chick in there.  They knew what she was doing, because she walked out, she had two floor tiles stuck to  the knee part of her pants.  One black, one white, from the checkerboard floor.  Wow.  Look at what this is doing.  Oh, that's nice.  All of a sudden, 20 windows opened up.  There's so many people that want to say hi, but there's like a million windows opening 
[01:50:00]  up on our phone system.  We've got to go back to the old phones.  This is just not working.  Every day, there's something wrong with the phones.  Holy, yeah.  You can't shut those windows?  No, I can't.  Look.  The mouse is just going everywhere.  That mouse sure is jumpy.  That's a crazy mouse.  I'll say it is.  See, there's a lot of great calls we could go to.  Yeah, we could.  But instead, we've got to probably hear another tired freaking comedy bit.  We'll return.  We'll return. 
[01:50:30]  Welcome to the Opie and...  You know what's weird about New York?  And I was...  This is my little story of my life.  I was born in New York, and I grew up in Florida.  Hollywood, Florida, which is a very beautiful place.  But it's very different.  And I used to talk like this when I was a little kid, because I'm from Brooklyn.  You know, I used to talk like this.  My mother made the best fucking spaghetti in the fucking neighborhood.  And that's how we talk.  And I moved to Florida, and the kids used to make fun of my accent.  And they're like, hey, kids, say something.  Hey, what do you want me to say?  And they go, ah!  So you become aware of your accent.  So it's not really a stick.  But the weird thing about the New York accent, there's no logical way the New York accent 
[01:51:00]  could have been conceived.  No logical way.  First people in America were who?  Now the States were who?  Danish.  Danish, right?  Well, you have a different textbook than we did.  Because it was an Indian thing.  I don't know.  Maybe you're missing chapter one, or you're absent that day.  We forget the Indians.  But I know what you meant.  And you're right, in a sense, if you just wipe off the Indians like we did many, many  years ago.  You know, that's an easy way to figure that out.  But the good thing is that you're ready with the answer right away.  You know, you had 10 or 20 seconds before the buzzer was going to sound. 
[01:51:30]  But you were, Danish!  You know what I mean?  Unless you were ordering from the bar, and I didn't, you know, you know what I mean?  It was like, Danish!  And they're like, oh shit, the timing was impeccable, you know?  But, yeah.  But anyway, so the first people in America were Indians, and their accent is nothing like  New York.  And the first people to settle in the United States, in New York, were British people,  and their accent is nothing like New York.  So that's, the Dutch, well, the Dutch, the Dutch didn't stay long.  They went all the way down to Bowling Green.  They couldn't find parking.  They fucked off and went home. 
[01:52:00]  That's what happened with the Danish.  It's really true.  But the British actually were the settlers, and they, and, but no matter what, there's  no logical way the accent could have been conceived, because even if it was Indians and Danish,  how did Kemosabe, and like, all right, turn into Opiole's Joe, you know what I mean?  Right?  There's no natural progression anywhere, unless Christopher Columbus spoke that way.  You know, it's like, hey, who's sailing the frickin' Nina?  Jesus, that boat's going up and down all over the ocean over there.  Guy's a freak.  Look at him.  He's going up and down.  He's drunk, like Delaware, you know? 
[01:52:30]  Heather.  The Maverick Minute from Maverick Business Consulting.  Welcome.  I'm Bill Stark.  And I'm Dr. Marty Cohen.  The subject we've been discussing this week is crisis leadership.  Yesterday, we spoke of five key challenges for a great leader during a crisis to inform,  direct, manage expectations, touch, and inspire.  Tell us more, Marty.  You can help people in crisis manage their expectations by conveying, for example,  that within what is possible, their very best is being done.  Messages such as this will help people maintain perspective and tolerate uncertainty longer. 
[01:53:00]  And?  Competent emotional leadership also speaks to and about shared values,  those things that bind us as a company or as a community.  When we remind people what we're about, we inspire them to function at their best.  And in order to do all these things, a leader has to be highly visible and visible often.  Speaking of crises, Doc, we're out of time.  Join us tomorrow for more about effective crisis leadership.  Maverick LLC, we make change possible.  Log on at maverickllc.com.

You don't wanna be depressed watching starving children.  So turn them off and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo of the child you're healthy in the outfit of your choice.

[01:55:00]  You're checking out the O and A show.  It's the O and A virus spreading across America.  What's up, peeps?  I wanna say hi to my peeps.  Peeps?  You're liking your XM coffee mug there, Jim Norton?  I gotta be honest.  I'm really stoked about getting these XM mugs. 
[01:55:30]  They're like really futuristic looking.  A fine little...  Look at that.  Well, you know, no billboards for the Opie and Anthony Show, but thank God we all got  our industrial coffee mugs.  Well, maybe they could put Opie and Anthony on the mugs and we could all drive around  holding them out the windows.  Stainless steel.  Grassroots, guys.  When you say good morning to everyone, you can raise your coffee mug and go, oh, wait,  what's that?  Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  Here's to the finest mom and pop radio show.  They do look like Klingon Steins.  It's the type of thing that Gene Hackman should be smashing into somebody else's beer glass. 
[01:56:00]  All right.  A quick thing.  We want to help the pedophiles out there today.  Attaboy.  Not really.  Because I don't want to read emails.  No, read them.  Send emails.  Of course, you don't want to help them.  Yeah, it's called a little joke, but it's something we have noticed as far as these pedophiles  go.  Pedophiles seem to be pretty stupid people.  Very stupid people.  Kid perv nailed in cyber sting. 
[01:56:30]  A Manhattan attorney was busted in an internet sex sting after attempting to meet someone  he believed was a 13.  Hold on a minute.  Opie and Anthony's Hot Team News.  Oh.  Kid perv nailed in cyber sting.  A Manhattan attorney was busted in an internet sex sting after attempting to meet someone  he believed was a 13-year-old girl on Long Island, police said yesterday.  Lucky for him, it wasn't a 13-year-old boy.  Because he's one notch above complete dirtbag. 
[01:57:00]  Complete scumbag animal.  Excuse me, Patty Tong.  I'm reading the news story.  Oh, I'm like the other anchor that sits there.  Oh, you are?  Are you the one that's going to be a...  You're right there, Jim.  Now here's the weather.  Yeah, can I segue in with the weather?  Speaking of 13, it's going to be bloody rainy.  Here's Tom with sports.  He's really gay, but he's making believe he's not on TV. 
[01:57:30]  Well, 13 is bad, but 14 is worse if you're the Yankees, and that's how many innings you're  playing last night.  Talk about being fucked at 14.  David Ortiz drove it deep in the 14th.  Now here's Jason with your entertainment update.  Jason's banging the co-anchor, but no one's supposed to know about that.  Man, they're a bunch of freaking sex addicts, the people that do the news. 
[01:58:00]  I like when they turn to the weather guy.  When are you going to give us a nice day?  Right, like it's up to him.  He's got all of a sudden.  Well, I'm working on it.  I'm working on it.  Don't kill me, but this weekend's going to be a washout.  For once, would you like to see an honest answer?  Like, let's do character work.  You be the news person and ask me that, and I'll be the weather guy.  Ha ha, Jimmy.  When are you going to give us a nice day?  When black stops stealing.  Wow. 
[01:58:30]  Wow.  Wow.  I'm just saying that was a...  You just wrecked our bed.  No, I didn't.  We could have done at least 20 more minutes there.  I think we should do more.  I was just doing...  That was the weather man.  That was the guy.  No, look, the music went away and everything.  Everyone just...  You wrecked it.  I didn't wreck it.  Yeah, we were going to go to the entertainment broad that's...  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bring a...  The gossip columnist.  Right, right.  I apologize.  Did I bring a tasteless angle to the help the pedophile bit?  I apologize. 
[01:59:00]  I didn't mean to go lowbrow on that one.  Ha ha ha.  All right.  Well, so we got the 13-year-old girl in Long Island, right?  We're up to that point.  Steven Lever, 30, began an online relationship.  See, this is where we want to help the pedophiles out there.  Steven, 30, began an online relationship with an undercover male detective from the computer  crime section over the summer and was nabbed Sunday morning when he showed up at the Rokankama 
[01:59:30]  Long Island Railroad Station to pick up the girl.  The girl.  Usually they try to pick him up at the mall.  He was getting off the train.  Oh, just thinking he's going to...  No, he's at...  Well, he was at the train trying to pick her up.  Yeah.  I guess he was taking the train out to see him or whatever.  Yeah, the cops nabbed him right when he was getting off the train.  Right.  Okay, so this guy started engaging the girl in a Yahoo chat room in July under the screen  name Mad Chatter.  Ha ha.  Mad Chatter.  And his talk gradually became sexual in nature. 
[02:00:00]  A few weeks ago, Lever began trying to make arrangements to meet with her.  His chats were extremely sexually explicit.  He talked with her about getting involved in a sexual relationship, sexual intercourse,  oral sexual conduct.  Ooh.  Uh, and I would love to read the rest of this, but, uh, it's all ripped in a way that  I can't read words.  Yeah.  It's very hard to rip out articles top to bottom in the paper.  I have nothing to say, uh, a lover told the Post yesterday afternoon.  I'm leaving on a long trip.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you are.  You're leaving on a long trip. 
[02:00:30]  A very long trip.  I'm going to end at the, uh, the prison.  Mm-hmm.  Why are guys still trying to do this on the internet?  That's what I don't get.  I don't think there are any, uh, teen girls in any of these chat rooms.  I just don't think it happens.  Uh, I think they're all police officers sitting there on the other end laughing at you.  Make sure you say think a lot.  That I think would be very, I think, very key here.  And, uh, I think they laugh at you and your explicit sexual talk and they can't wait to 
[02:01:00]  arrest you.  There's not, if, if, if they say they're a 13-year-old girl and they're, they're chatting  online with you about explicit sexual conduct and what they want to do to you and how they  want to suck it and where they want you to put it.  Yeah.  It's a cop.  If they're online talking about how, how their friend Susie took their books home and now  you can't do your homework, that's probably a 13-year-old girl. 
[02:01:30]  If they're talking about the, the crush on the guy in, in class.  Oh, Steven's so cute.  Right.  Uh, uh, that's probably a, a, a girl.  Probably a 13-year-old girl.  If she's talking about how she wants you to do the, uh, Roman war helmet on her, probably  a cop.  Probably a really pissed off cop that can't, can't wait to get his hands on you.  Oh, cannot wait for you to step off that train and put you in cuffs.  Can I correct you?  You say probably a cop. 
[02:02:00]  Some of us would say unfortunately a cop.  Jesus.  You know, 13-year-old girls don't usually, uh, type in chats about older men wanting to  get the donkey punch.  You know?  That's usually not a 13-year-old girl.  Usually a cop.  Usually.  Yes, Big Kev?  Did you see the film 13?  Uh, no, I, I, I heard about it.  Oh my God.  The film 13 is really, really hot.  Is it hot?  Oh man, you'll think differently about the number 13 once you've seen that film. 
[02:02:30]  That's, and it's a real story, the girl, uh, but it's not, it's not a documentary, is it?  Yeah, it is.  She wrote a book at what, 15 years old and then they made a movie into it.  But, but, but wait a minute, is it the actual girl or are there actresses portraying?  It's actually, the actual girl who wrote it is one of the girls in the film.  Yes.  She acted in it as the friend or something.  Yeah.  But it's not a documentary.  No.  No.  Okay.  It's a film about her experience.  It's based on her life.  Yeah.  Yes.  All right.  And can I point. 
[02:03:00]  That's not as hot as if it was real.  Right.  Uh, yes, Jim?  I, I just, I know it's radio, but I wanted to point out that Kevin is wearing the worst  shirt I've ever seen anybody wear.  Worse than, uh, Steve's shirts?  Wow, that could be worse than one of Steve C's shirts.  It makes Steve's shirts look like Donna Karan's suits.  It's a black, let me tell you, let me describe it.  It's a, what is it?  Steve complimented me on that.  Of course he did.  Oh my goodness.  He's going to make that into a tattoo if he can find a spot on his body.  It has just green skeleton heads on it, all over it, and a, a, just this awful mishmash 
[02:03:30]  of non-pattern.  All it needs is flames, and Steve would be, have it on in two seconds.  Oh, I've had enough of Steve and his awful flame hats, and what's wrong with you?  You know, Mark makes a good point on, um, on, uh, the phones here.  Go ahead, Mark.  Yeah, what's the deal with all these pedophiles from Ronkonkoma?  Uh, just a month ago, we had that, uh, New York City cop from Ronkonkoma that was,  uh, online, thought he was talking to a little boy.  And he met him up in Westchester, and the little boy wound up being a cop, uh, being 
[02:04:00]  another cop.  Well, Long Island is your pedophile leader, man.  There's so many pedophiles coming from the Long Island area for some reason.  Oh, it's a hotbed.  It is a hotbed.  Did you guys, uh, see the picture of the guy in the New York Post of that, uh, incident?  No.  Well, I usually don't like to look at, uh, pictures of guys, so.  Well, he, well, he was wearing, while they were arresting him, he was wearing a shirt.  Yeah.  With a little cartoon character that said, all-nighter.  Oh, oh, boy.  I'm a police officer.  Uh-oh.  All right, thank you. 
[02:04:30]  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Oh, now you're busted.  Opie and Anthony's Hot Team News.  Ah, yes, this just in, Anthony.  Yes.  Man guilty of burying pregnant teen alive.  Oh, oh.  A man was convicted in Boston of murdering his best friend's pregnant 14-year-old girlfriend  by stabbing her, beating her with a rock, and burying her alive.  How old was he?  He was 25.  He received an automatic life sentence without parole on two counts of murder in the 1999  slaying of, name I can't pronounce, and her fetus. 
[02:05:00]  Stop whining.  I heard they tossed in a fine for littering.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, lots of hot teen news coming in today.  Yeah.  Teen pals in peril.  Oh.  Runaways, New York City bound, Anthony.  New York authorities are on the lookout for a pair of runaway teenage girls from Oklahoma  who stole a parent's car for a cross-country trek to sea, a boy, one met, on the Internet. 
[02:05:30]  Uh-oh, is this story connected to the other story?  The pint-sized Thelma and Louise.  Oh, that's a funny, Jim.  Duo have been missing from their Cherokee County homes near Tulsa since Friday when they called  a friend from the road and said they were bound for the Big Apple.  Oh, that's always a good thing.  when young teen girls leave the rural areas to head for New York City.  Let me save the NYPD a lot of time and effort. 
[02:06:00]  Go up, up there.  They all end up in the Bronx for some reason.  Yeah.  These girls will be found in the Bronx.  Well, you know, it'll happen.  You know, go way up there, the place we don't talk about.  The pimp will pull up in the car and ask if they're hungry.  Need a ride, maybe.  And then buy them some food at the diner.  Yeah.  And then slowly but surely build up their confidence. 
[02:06:30]  All right.  And get the information on them.  The pimps always get the skinny on the girl.  Oh, really?  Get their life story, sure.  I think we have one more hot teen news story.  Opie and Anthony's Hot Teen News.  Yes.  I'm going to go across the anchor desk here and talk to Anthony,  who has the Olsen twins update.  Oh, that's right.  This is the entertainment portion of the Hot Teen News segment.  You remember Mary Kate Olsen.  She's the Olsen twin, Opie, that went into rehab for an eating disorder. 
[02:07:00]  You know, the fat Olsen twin.  Teasing, of course.  She was the one that was really skinny.  And they sent her to rehab.  Well, she was in NYU trying to go to college like a regular gal, even though they have a few billion dollars.  You know, you need something to fall back on just in case you lose all that money.  So, she was going to NYU.  Apparently, people are saying now she's dropped out. 
[02:07:30]  She went back to Los Angeles where she's playing hooky.  What the hell was she doing in college anyway?  Why go to college?  She's a billionaire.  Why go to college?  Don't you go to college to better yourself?  Why would you go to college if you're a billionaire?  I don't get that.  This is that whole line of crap that everyone sells you.  That college is there, Opie, not just to get a better job and make money.  It builds your character.  It educates you and makes you a better person overall. 
[02:08:00]  What a load of crap that is.  You go to college for a piece of paper that you don't even show your employer.  Have you ever had to show your diploma?  No, what a waste.  You've never shown your diploma to anybody?  No, never even a high school diploma.  I don't even have a high school diploma.  A little advice to the high school kids out there.  Don't even worry.  They're never going to ask you to see the high school diploma.  You'll never be asked.  Just say you graduated.  And if you're not happy in school, put on a trench coat, pick up a rifle, be a man, and take charge. 
[02:08:30]  Make a few Freon bombs and stuff.  Sure, kids.  I never graduated high school.  You know what most kids do when they go to college?  They drink their faces off and figure out new ways to cheat.  They learn how to be adults by drinking and drugging.  And you try to find guys named Coach.  Coach?  Coach.  The only reason I graduated from Geneseo State University, Anthony.  Oh, really?  I'm a proud graduate of Geneseo State University. 
[02:09:00]  The communications department has never invited me back.  I used to pay a guy to do my work for me, yeah.  That's when I wasn't playing Animal House with the rest of the fraternity guys stealing the garbage to find the tests.  Oh.  Yeah.  I didn't graduate, but on every application I've ever had for employment of any job, I put down John H. Glenn High School in Elwood, New York. 
[02:09:30]  Wrote it down.  You know why?  Because they don't check.  You think the guy at the air conditioning and heating installation place is going to check if I graduated high school?  You think he's going to care?  And even better jobs, you know?  You've got to get a job in an office or something.  It doesn't matter.  You don't need a diploma.  Opie, look at where you are in life, and you've never had to show that sheepskin that you earned from Geneseo.  Well, thanks to Coach.  Thanks to Coach.  Can I tell my Coach story really fast? 
[02:10:00]  Unfortunately, the guy has passed on of a massive heart attack, I believe.  But he was a legend.  He was a legend at Geneseo.  A legend.  He would sit in the back of the Idle Hour, this little gin mill there where the locals went.  And I was having a tough time, you know, getting up and going to class and stuff.  And, you know, one of the older fraternity brothers goes, ha, ha, ha, getting up for class?  Let me tell you about Coach.  Going to educate you.  Let me tell you about Coach.  Coach is this guy that sat in the back of the Idle Hour. 
[02:10:30]  And you would go in there, and it was scary because he kind of looked like he had his people around him,  and he was well-protected.  And it was like kind of going to talk to the boss, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, right?  And you'd go up to him, and you'd go, hey, Coach, you know, I'm looking for a paper, man.  I'm looking for a paper.  He's like, oh, yeah, what are you taking?  And I had some stupid course where I had to write a paper on Russian history  because that's really important in the year 2004.  Very important for someone that wants to get into radio. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Absolutely.  Exactly.  Most of my classes were a complete waste of time.  So why learn about Russian history and write a paper so you graduate when Coach is sitting there  and happy hour awaits, you know, across the street?  So I swear to you, he goes, well, what do you want to get on the paper?  And he had a price list.  What do you want to get?  Well, like, great.  And I don't remember anymore, but it was like, you know, if you want an A, it'll cost you $200, let's say. 
[02:11:30]  You want a B, it'll cost you $150.  You want a C, it'll cost you $100.  If you just want to pass, it was like $75, something like that.  And I was not doing well in the class.  So me being very smart, street smart, Anthony.  I'm smart.  I'm like, hmm, if all of a sudden I get an A on a Russian history paper, the flags are going to be lifted,  and then the teacher's going to know something's going on.  So I go, just get me a passing grade, C minus, how about it?  Wow, C minus.  Let's split the difference, $87.50 or whatever it was. 
[02:12:00]  Not even a B?  Low self-esteem?  Really?  I don't know.  Well, the communication, he wrote, I don't know, at least three or four papers in my career.  I mean, he wrote everyone's papers.  And then I learned he didn't even really write the papers anymore.  This was before, you know, where you could get your papers on the Internet and stuff.  Did he franchise it out?  No, this guy had a, he was doing it, I don't know.  I might be exaggerating, but at least a decade, maybe longer.  So he had a whole file cabinet at his house with all the papers that he knows, you know, 
[02:12:30]  that the professors just rotate.  Wow.  So he would just take one out, fix it up a little, make it a little different, and give it to you.  All typed and everything.  You didn't have to do anything.  Hand him the money, he gives you the paper, you hand it in.  And wait a minute, the professors didn't notice that this was the same material?  They never caught on to this guy, I'm telling you.  I know so many people that went to this guy.  Man.  God bless his soul.  You would think they would, uh...  So then, um...  Were they exactly the same, or did you have to touch him up a little bit? 
[02:13:00]  I didn't even, I don't know.  You didn't put him in your own handwriting?  No, no, it was all typed.  All typed?  You didn't have to do anything.  Yeah, I didn't know nothing about college.  Oh, what's this?  Wow, you got great timing in the other room.  Wow, we had an organized crime reference about five minutes ago.  Oh, my God, no.  Do you have any coach music you can pipe in quickly?  So, uh, this is where it got a little crazy, though.  So I'm like, I don't have to worry about that class anymore, and I'm getting, you know, shit-faced across town and all of a sudden. 
[02:13:30]  And then I'm not hearing from coach.  Uh-oh.  And it's getting very close.  The paper's due the next day or whatever.  I'm trying to remember all the details, but this is a fact.  I get a call that coach had a heart attack, and he's in the hospital, and, you know, this representative of coach is like,  I don't know if you're going to get your paper in time, man.  You know, this was a bad one.  This was a bad one.  I'm like, I was in a complete panic, because I think it was around finals and stuff, and I needed to get, like, I don't know, a 2.7 or something to continue with my college career. 
[02:14:00]  And, you know, I'll make a long story short.  It's not the greatest ending, but basically, I ended up getting the paper anyway.  And, yeah, I got my team.  He got the paper!  And I got my C-minus.  There you go.  All due to coach.  So the Olsen twins, Anthony, I'm sorry.  Oh, right.  Sorry about that.  Yeah, we were talking about college.  Seems, well, isn't this hot teen news?  Oh, you want me to?  Yeah, because we kind of went off track there.  Oh, no, we went on to something else.  We're going to end up this cool Olsen twins story with Brother Joe's Olsen twins song. 
[02:14:30]  Ah, very good.  But if you wait a second, because we have great timing on this radio show, here it is.  Well, Mary-Kate, leaving NYU, went back to L.A., where she's staying indefinitely.  But a rep says that the move was only temporary.  Mary-Kate, as she is known to her friends MK, spent six weeks in rehab last summer for an eating disorder. 
[02:15:00]  There was speculation at the time that she was being treated for drug addiction.  We can only dream.  Her peeps declined to elaborate on why she decided to visit L.A. now.  She's there on personal business.  She had some things she wanted to take care of.  Uh-oh.  These personal reps are just liars.  They're your own liar. 
[02:15:30]  You know how regular people have to go around and lie to other people?  You know, you've got to go up and go, yeah, I can't make it.  I have this to do or that to do.  Or, no, I was out here, but I was actually there.  People like Mary-Kate Olsen, you could hire people to lie for you.  So they say, ah, she's still going to go back to school, but she's here temporarily.  She had some things she had to take care of.  She's missing very few classes, and her timing could hardly be worse because of looming exams. 
[02:16:00]  But everything's fine and dandy.  Can I say I hope she's in L.A. right now on her back with a vacuum inserted?  Oh, my God.  A tear-stained face and a parent holding the hand while some sort of proof of an interracial relationship  is being sucked out and put into a dumpster.  Oh, I can't believe this happened.  It's all right.  This won't get out. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, my God, you guys.  Uncle Jesse.  He played basketball on the team.  This is a lifetime movie.  I was drunk.  He grabbed it by the throat and said, NYU stands for Nice Young Uterus.  Are you done over there, Ant?  Yes, yes.  That concludes our hot teen news for today. 
[02:17:00]  Here's Mary Kate.  She likes Disney flicks and Barbie dolls and Fogo sticks.  But Ashley is a little slut.  She likes her loving in the butt.  Loves them porno flicks.  They're the old sands.  Adolescent vixens all the way.  They will give up their high mans.  Some lucky guy one day.  While Mary Kate likes to play knock-knock and hide-and-seek and sing a lot. 
[02:17:30]  Well, Ashley is the one that goes so glad they take off all her clothes for the money shot.  They're the old sands.  Identical vixens.  And you'll find.  They laugh alike.  They want alike.  I bet they'll even fuck alike.  And you know they'll be tight.  The old sands.  Take them from behind. 
[02:18:00]  I've had many opportunities.  But never joined any group.  Nothing.  Not in my bag.  Everybody got to do their thing.  I was a Boy Scout once.  And this didn't come in handy until the night before last.  She called her Fox Your Ring.  I said, my watch and cufflinks and elbow. 
[02:18:30]  You didn't know you were going to have some fun, did you, honey?  Look at her, man.  Let her lean on in, brother.  Get your cheek all breezy.  I ain't with no group.  I told you that.  Call me up.  Try to get me in a group.  Man, I'm a leader.  I don't believe in burning and looting. 
[02:19:00]  I don't believe in that.  You hate somebody, sit behind them on the bus with a dart gun.  And...  You feel that prick in your neck.  It's all over.  That poison made out of hippopotamus lip drippings.  Right out the corner.  Yeah.  That's good meat, hippopotamus.  My cousin sent me a piece.  From Africa.  Hippopotamus lip. 
[02:19:30]  Put it in a crate and sent it over.  Hippopotamus got a lip on him, didn't he?  He was a cannibal chief and a witch doctor eating a missionary.  Witch doctor said, chief, I'm having a ball.  Chief said, were you eating too fast?  God damn it.  Put it back and eat that circle.  Ever been to a great party that you wish never ended? 
[02:20:00]  At Liquid Metal by Phone, hundreds of singles in your area are smoking, drinking, and becoming friends with other singles.  Here's Brian.

[02:20:30]  She's bi-curious and wonders what it would feel like to be with another girl.  Karen just got off on some pretty serious acid and thinks she's talking to a giant tulip.

[02:21:00]  It's everything.  24-7.  XM.  20-2.  The O&A Virus.  It's everything.  All the time.  I think it's two chimps on a Davenport and a bass.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Let's see what's going on on the phones today. 
[02:21:30]  Tennessee.  A lot of people checking us out from Tennessee, Anthony.  It's Dennis.  What's up, Dennis?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Pretty good, man.  Hi. 
[02:22:00]  Hey, man.  A couple years ago, I was in Albany, Georgia.  I met this girl at a truck stop.  She was a waitress.  And now we hooked up.  Boy, our girl was a freak.  She was like, well, I like it when I used to stick my tongue up that ass of hers and fuck her pussy with my finger.  Boy, she starts squirming around like a damn worm on a hook.  Totally awesome.  Freakiest girl I've ever met in my damn life.  All right.  Hey, well, thanks for sharing today.  How about that?  We'd like to share on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  She sounds like a good waitress. 
[02:22:30]  And the point being, Dennis.  That I was like an asshole's goodness.  Are you saying, sir, that she used to be sad and used to be shy, and the saddest part, that she was a twat and she never knew why?  Because you know what?  Before she met you, sir, kicking herself for nothing was her favorite sport.  He was banging truck stop waitresses for the time.  Players couldn't get an omelet at the table.  You're going to straighten my busboy out? 
[02:23:00]  Hey, I gave her a good cup.  Well, thanks for sharing.  Anytime, guys.  Good luck.  Are you a trucker?  Yeah, I am.  Yeah?  Where are you hauling to today?  Well, I'm on my way to the Philadelphia Produce Market coming out of the Shakey.  I'm just outside of K-Town right now.  You're out of where?  I just came out of California.  I'm just outside of Knoxville, Tennessee.  I'm on my way to the Philadelphia Produce Market.  K-Town.  And will you be bobtailing later on or what?  No, I got to be in.  I live up there in northeast Pennsylvania. 
[02:23:30]  So from the Philadelphia market, I go straight home.  All right.  So you got to bobtail all the way home, no?  No, no.  I take my trailer home.  Oh, okay.  I'll just bail it.  All right.  I'm just checking.  Hey, guys.  They're awesome, man.  Wish you guys the best of luck out here.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, good buddy.  And a big thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  There he goes, Dennis.  Bye.  And there he goes.  There he goes, Dennis.  Hauling his whatever there. 
[02:24:00]  Okay.  That's right.  He's got to go and haul a load of manure.  Shitty job.  Main checking in.  This is D'Air.  D'Air.  Opie and Anthony.  How are you, D'Air?  I'm doing good today.  Calling your Frenchie.  Oh, yeah.  Where is Frenchie today?  We got a bunch of French guys.  I want to take them on.  He's not up yet.  You want to take on Frenchie, D'Air?  I want to take on Frenchie.  That piece of shit is faggot, faggot, faggot.  That's all the fucking guy says is faggot. 
[02:24:30]  This is probably the worst fake French accent I've ever heard.  You know what?  You can't even keep it going for more than a word.  And then you just start talking like the American that you are.  Did we get you, bro?  No.  No.  Now he's Mexican.  He's Canadian.  What are you, sir?  Hey, man, I'm French.  Sorry to fucking bother you guys today, then.  I am very French. 
[02:25:00]  Very true.  You, Opie and Anthony, and fat kids.  Have a good day.  Wait, sir, sir, sir.  I apologize for questioning you.  Sir?  Oh.  Say something.  Say something.  Maman, Jacques Montachete.  Speak French.  No, no, I don't speak French.  I am from, my family is from.  What a tool.  I do not speak French.  I do not speak French.  I have an accent.  I just do the accent poorly. 
[02:25:30]  Okay.  Sorry to bother you.  Shut up, stupid.  Just.  That was awful.  Awful.  You mean, I am French.  See?  Well, we do have one guy that's going to take on Frenchie so far.  Yeah, yeah.  We're looking for the new Frenchie.  Painted a little thin mustache on himself in the mirror.  Little mustache that curled up at the sides.  Wearing a beret.  Bicycling around town with a baguette sticking out of the basket.  Dragging his hairy legs, non-shaven under the armpit.  Twat of a woman around town.  Smoking a cigarette, tightly clutched. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Between the index finger.  Yeah.  And thumb.  Judgmental, emasculating woman fingers.  Just going, let me, you stupid American.  We could do everything if it wasn't for America.  You frog.  You fake frog.  They've given us nothing.  Hey, thanks for, what, they fixed milk so we could drink it?  Big deal.  Thanks for giving us a nice mouthful of cow load. 
[02:26:30]  They must have given us something besides milk.  We've pasteurized your milk, you stupid American.  Exactly.  We took your regular toast and made it sweet with egg and cinnamon.  You just would put it in a toaster.  We made it great with cinnamon and egg and milk.  Fucking fuck.  Uh-huh.  Wow, this guy's pissed.  You used to just kiss and go, mm-mm.  We taught you to put the tongue in the mouth. 
[02:27:00]  Jim Norton took it to the extreme and puts it in the asshole.  But that is doing it, what they say, how you say, French.  Who's pissed off?  Uh, this guy listening in.  Henry.  Henry.  Henry.  Henry, I called you guys yesterday.  Oh, you're the Jacques Cousteau sounding guy.  That is me, yeah.  Cousteau in the middle of the Calypso.  Descent to a depth of 130 feet.  This guy definitely wants to take on Frenchy.  Where is Frenchy today?  Is he hiding under his sheets? 
[02:27:30]  He's not up yet, not until 9 o'clock.  Who answered the phone?  He said he turned his phone off or something.  Yeah, no, he goes right to his voicemail.  Oh, I think we're going to have dueling Frenchies in the 9 o'clock hour today, Ben?  When are you going to put the siding on that god-awful Eiffel Tower?  It's been a wreck for years.  When are you going to put some walls on that thing?  You're welcome for the Statue of Liberti.  Oh, that is true.  Ah, we didn't even ask for it.  Shut up.  All right.  Send it over like a gift.  Norton is the only one who puts tongues and asses, that fat bastard anyway. 
[02:28:00]  I do.  Thanks for that Statue of Liberty, taking it upon yourself to let us accept the dregs of society.  Yeah.  Give us your disgusting, your broke, your AIDS-infested.  That's not how it goes.  Can you say it on there?  You're tired and you're...  You're worthless and weak.  Exactly.  And you're...  Thanks, France.  What a present that is.  Here, take this, put it at the entrance to your main harbor, and it's a sign that says  everyone with huge problems, come over here now. 
[02:28:30]  How about refixing that stupid statue so the thing says, give us your big-tinted with  no gag reflex?  How about that?  That'd be lovely.  Oh, thank you for that fat bastard, Jerry Lewis.  Hey, you guys decided you liked him.  Piece of shit.  We didn't give him to you.  You guys accepted him.  You can't get enough of that nutty professor.  Oh, Jerry.  That is so funny.  Look at when he goes...  I don't like him.  So...  All right. 
[02:29:00]  Whatever.  Get that Frenchie on the phone.  Yeah, thanks for Gerard Depardieu, you dopey French.  Faggot.  What an awful actor he is.  You and the other two faggots.  Gerard Depardieu.  Thank you for Maurice Chevalier.  Thank heaven.  The little girls.  All right.  He was pretty good.  All right, bro.  We're going to call you in a little while.  We got Henry's number or whatever.  Henry.  Henry.  Henry.  Henry.  Henry.  It's Henry.  Why don't you just say Henry.  Hey, Henry. 
[02:29:30]  I worry about you, Henry.  You might fall under questioning.  You might fall under questioning.  Then we're going to find it, Henry.  Karen, that is all we have.  Call me back when you have that cocksucker on.  Okay?  Yes.  Yes.  Oh.  Wow.  That's going to be the...  Henry.  That's going to be the bit of the day right there when those two guys go at it.  Hey, you want to talk about Patti Davis or you want to do the 50 worst songs of all time? 
[02:30:00]  Oh, I forgot we had that.  50 worst songs?  50 worst songs of all time.  According to Blender Magazine, we're not going to do all 50, right?  Of course not.  That would take forever.  Wow.  Celine Dion made the list at number 50 with My Heart Will Go On.  My Heart Will Go On.  I thought that was a huge hit, though, for her.  Good song, too.  Along with my camel toe.  The Beatles made the list with Obla Di, Obla Da. 
[02:30:30]  That's the worst song ever?  It's ridiculous.  Right Said Fred with I'm Too Sexy is on the list.  New Kids.  Hanging Tough.  Hanging Tough.  We Didn't Start the Fire.  Billy Joel made the list.  That was a bad one.  How did the Sounds of Silence make the list?  Simon and Garfunkel.  Because you know what?  We've talked about this.  These lists mean nothing.  I know that.  It just gives us fodder to goof on things.  These lists are never accurate or based on anything that makes any sense, okay?  Yeah.  Who thought of that?  Like, The Sound of Silence is just a non-issue song. 
[02:31:00]  Right.  It's kind of there.  It's not incredibly bad, but...  Let's see.  We're moving on here.  She Bang.  She Bang is on the list.  Yeah, sure.  The Doors, The End is one of the worst songs of all time.  Are they insane?  What?  That's in 26th place.  They do that to be, like, shocking.  Like, wow.  We go against the grain.  We're so hip that we know this is trash.  We go against the grain.  Spin Doctor's Two Princes?  Final Countdown.  That's not...  You know, it's...  American Life by Madonna. 
[02:31:30]  Look, I despise Madonna, but that's a great song.  Except when she raps.  Oh.  Nah.  That is one of the worst Madonna songs ever.  The song is good.  The rap part is awful.  You two are arguing a Madonna song.  Madonna's got some good songs.  Fuck it.  You are true.  Fuck it.  What we should do to settle this is check into a hotel and gobble each other's  cocked.  The first one to go, ah, loses the argument.  Okay, Jim.  A couple of fruits.  You know, when Ebony and Ivory does suck.  Hold on.  You're giving away all the good ones, you ass. 
[02:32:00]  Uh-oh.  He's dipping into the big numbers.  Yeah.  The tease was all the cute...  You find something before the top ten and go, oh, wow, Sunglasses at Night by Corey Hart  in 23rd place.  That's outrageous.  How did that happen?  Right.  You tease it, bro.  Come on now.  There's no other ones.  Oh, Barbie Girl by Aqua.  Lionel Richie dancing on the ceiling.  You can't dance on the ceiling.  Oh, what a feeling.  How about last night during the game when they did All Night Long by Lionel Richie to 
[02:32:30]  the clips from the game, from the late night game of the Sox Yankee game.  Played All Night Long.  Just show us the baseball game and stop with all the extracurricular crap.  Fox can throw together a music montage in the time it takes to put on commercial break.  Awful.  They throw it together and they get all the clips from the previous inning and now it's  a whole thing that probably used to take like a week to put together.  Yeah, and then they're playing this song in the background.  Night shift?  No.  All Night Long.  All Night Long.  But it's really long in the background. 
[02:33:00]  They were showing it.  So, yeah.  You know what?  The Red Sox are going to have to do it without me tonight.  There's no way I'm staying up for another five-hour game.  And this one starts at eight, right?  Eight o'clock?  No party at your house tonight for the game?  Hell no.  Come on.  And with the rain delay that they're probably going to get.  And they have to play.  So it's going to be...  How many guys were at the house?  What kind of party was this?  We had a big party.  You missed it, Jimmy.  Who was there?  A few guys over for the game, Jimmy.  A few guys over for the game.  No Earl, though.  You were invited?  I know.  All right.  This doesn't sound like a party.  It's like a bunch of Moe's just sitting there sharing a thing of chips. 
[02:33:30]  Burritos, actually.  They don't be putting on any chips.  No, they ate burritos.  Yeah.  That's great.  Simone said there's farts.  Fighting over who gets their liquidy shit first during the break.  How did I miss that shindig?  He's bashing your party over.  I know.  But the listeners know what the deal is.  I know.  After all the stories you tell, my party's...  I'm not saying it's a bad get-together.  It wasn't a party.  It was just like, hey, come over and watch the game.  That's fine.  And then watch me take 100 phone calls from people that obviously aren't baseball fans. 
[02:34:00]  I don't mind that.  I just don't like it being called a party by Ben.  All right.  So you want to do the top 10 songs of all time according to Blender Magazine.  We can run through a few of these, Anthony.  Yes.  In 10th place.  Are we ready for this there, Sex Bagel?  We're going to see how good he is on the switch today.  Under pressure.  In 10th place.  Oh, we need a drum roll and everything.  10th worst song of all time, Anthony.  Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder.  Yes. 
[02:34:30]  Ebony.  Ah, I remember this one.  How awful.  Horrendous.  You just completely forgot he was in the Beatles.  Yes.  Side by side on my hand.  I like playing this as I watch the Rodney King beating video.  That's a good one.  Or the Reginald Denny getting that slam dunk cinder block over his hand. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, my God.  Speaking of uncomfortable moment.  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah.  Club Soda Kenny, as you know, he called the first day on our show.  He was a disaster, but he's a great guy.  And he's a funny guy, but it just went horribly wrong.  We were at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when we drove through Cleveland.  Why is Poe taking pictures out there?  What's he taking pictures?  I don't know.  I'm hoping it's security issues.  Is somebody for the office actually building the office?  Yes, Steve.  What? 
[02:35:30]  What happened?  Nothing.  Nothing bad.  Poe just documents everything.  Why?  Security purposes.  What's he documenting?  He probably studies the pictures at night and sees if he can find a breach.  Yeah.  Look at him.  He does.  He is absolutely hardcore about this stuff.  This guy takes his job very, very seriously.  He's looking at the ductwork, wondering if someone could slither through it.  Yeah.  Maybe hold a pistol with a silencer out the grill and take someone out.  You joke.  I don't joke.  I'm being absolutely serious.  He's just photographing the bulge of the guy on the ladder. 
[02:36:00]  Or he wants to show these pictures to his family to show everybody where he works.  He's all proud of his job.  That's all it is.  So we're at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.  And they're doing an MTV, doing a little history of MTV, and doing video clips.  And it's really cool.  The history of MTV is an exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  Yeah.  So they...  Oh, fascinating.  I have to get there.  You missed it.  You didn't come with us.  No shit, I didn't go.  I wouldn't be caught in that place.  So they have these wall of TVs on every angle. 
[02:36:30]  So you're in this octagon type of room.  And then in the middle is just a ton of TV.  So wherever you are in the octagon room, you're watching this presentation.  And it was produced really nice, and quick editing and things like that, doing the history of MTV.  And then you've got to take it from here, because I don't remember exactly how it went down.  But I think it was a Rage Against the Machine song was playing, and they started showing the beating of Rodney King.  And Club Soda Kenny just goes, nice!  Really loud.  I burst out laughing.  Obie starts laughing.  We're laughing so hard, and there's no one that has the balls to get into Kenny's face, because he's just a psychopath. 
[02:37:00]  Giant, yeah.  But he's like, nice!  And he's like, clapping and really getting into it.  I wanted to hide, man.  I wanted to crawl under the rug.  I'm like, you're insane.  It was pretty funny.  There were people just mortified.  Nice.  So nice.  Top 10 worst songs of all time in 10th place, Paul McCartney.  And Stevie Wonder, a song they certainly do not play in Boston, Ebony and Ivory. 
[02:37:30]  Can I say one thing, though?  Paul McCartney did a really great song with Michael Jackson when they're both drinking the magic potion,  which apparently makes you like one-legged girls and children.  What was the name of that song?  Say, say, say.  Say, say, say.  Hold on.  We got Club Soda Kenny.  Hello!  Oh, man.  I thought you didn't have your XM hooked up yet.  I thought I could trash you without you knowing about it.  I got the power of X, brother. 
[02:38:00]  You're part of the XM Nation, finally?  I got the power.  I got the virus.  I got everything.  Very nice.  Listen, I heard my name.  I got all excited.  And I just want to comment.  Yeah, go ahead.  What was better than that beating?  On video?  I don't know.  What was better?  I didn't get a chance to do it in real life, son.  Yeah.  That's the best thing.  I don't know.  The Reginald Denny video is pretty good, though.  I'm old school.  Where that one guy slam dunks the flower pot thing over Reginald's head and then does that 
[02:38:30]  little dance move?  Oh, hoobly, hoobly.  Hoobly, hoobly.  Hoobly, hoobly.  Skips away stupidly.  Does that laugh in his ass off as Reginald sits there all brain damaged in the middle  of MLK with Ebony and Ivory playing in the background?  Yeah.  I'm sure.  Wouldn't that be ironic if that was playing on his little truck radio and they dragged  him out and bludgeoned him?  No, it's all good.  Club Soda Kenny.  Hello.  So what did you say? 
[02:39:00]  You just said nice and started laughing and almost laughing like De Niro and Cape Fear  and clapping and stuff.  And everyone was horrified, but no one had the balls to come up to you and say, what is  your effing problem?  Yeah, I don't think the 40 other people that were watching that tribute really liked that  too much.  My new Kenny thing?  Yeah?  Like all these other guys like Voss and Norton and Florentine, they're all amateurs.  I mean, he is the master of making you feel very, very uncomfortable when you're walking  around the streets of whatever city, but city here. 
[02:39:30]  His new one, we're outside the club in Cleveland, just hanging out after doing our gig, you know,  turning a lot of people on to XM radio and all that.  And these really, really hot girls with the small skirts and they're just, they're like  nines and tens just walking by.  And Club Soda Kenny, without even missing a beat and just commits to it, is not shy.  He just looks them right in the eye as they're walking by and go, holy shit, you're fucking  hot. 
[02:40:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  And they don't know what to say.  They're like, they just start stammering and they're like, well, thanks.  My favorite.  Yeah, he doesn't have that switch in his head that makes you not say those things.  Gee, I wanted to want him because he's 6'5 with a pistol.  That'd probably remove my switch as well.  But I love, my favorite is, wow-wee.  Wow-wee.  I don't know how to treat a lady.  What's that?  I really know how to treat a lady.  You really are a softie.  Oh, that's where I got the wow-wee from because I'm trying not to say it anymore.  It's Kenny. 
[02:40:30]  I'm getting abused on the email.  Why is Opie saying wow-wee a lot?  That's why you should keep saying it and say it more.  Wow-wee.  Why is Opie wearing the same shirt in a few of the press interviews?  Maybe because they were done on the same day, idiot.  Hey, you know what?  Jesus.  You want me to change in between interviews for you?  Yep.  You cannot listen to the people on the phone or on the feedback that are talking about  how you look.  A guy who's all concerned is like, does Opie own more than one shirt?  Yeah.  We did interviews a lot in one day. 
[02:41:00]  Should I have had a wardrobe and some guy to do my hair like another radio personality  out there and have costume changes?  Yeah.  Well, now it's the VH1 thing, so I'm going to look like a young, hip, Abercrombie and  Fitch kid.  And for the New York Times, I think I'm going to go with a little sweater number.  Well, the VH1 thing, they set us down in front of that massive bank of lights with no makeup,  and we had been up for about 20 hours straight. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  And I have to read a guy saying, Anthony, would you got the AIDS?  Anthony, how about a razor?  It's like, didn't you just say, I should have listened to the...  No, no, I read them, but you shouldn't take them to heart like that.  It confuses me.  If a girl said it, fine, but why is a guy commenting on what I'm wearing?  The day I have to worry that a guy doesn't find me attractive?  Your job is just to listen to the show, and if you like it, great.  If not, oh well.  Yeah.  Can I talk now?  That guy didn't find me attractive. 
[02:42:00]  No, not at all, Kenny.  We're trying to help you out here.  When we leave you by yourself and alone, you're kind of drowning.  Mike G, Mike G.  Mike G.  From Brooklyn said about you, he says he's got the power of X and he's got the virus,  but now all he needs is a new phone.  Your phone over-modulates a little bit.  Well, I can't help it.  I'm so boisterous.  Wow, that's a big word for you, Kenny.  Boisterous.  Very proud of you.  You pulled out the boisterous.  All right, I'll say one thing before you hang up on me.  Okay.  Yesterday when I turned on, the first thing I heard was that woman from Tennessee jerking 
[02:42:30]  herself off.  Okay, she's in love with Jim Norton, and she did it in front of her husband for everybody.  Who isn't in love with Jim Norton?  Well, he's got a point.  And Tennessee is the state leader in sex as far as this show goes.  Yeah, that was terrific.  We had a couple AF live on the air and a girl get off in front of her husband because she's  a big fan of Jim Norton.  The Boston couple let us down so far, so we're looking for maybe another couple to get involved  in this cute little contest. 
[02:43:00]  Yes, Ben.  How about when Kenny, when we were in Boston doing the Boston event, walking down Newberry  Street, and there was a crowd outside the Ritz-Carlton, and Kenny decides to figure out  who it is, and it was the Yankees were staying there.  He's, the fucking New York Yankees!  Woo!  Screaming, yelling.  And he's calling Ope some other name.  And he's like, Jimmy, do you believe it's the fucking Yankees?  The fucking Yankees right there!  They're screaming in the middle of Newberry Street.  There's all these people looking at him, and I'm just like, oh my God.  Could you see the actual Yankees or no?  No, their bus was outside.  And then clubs over Kenny, who's, you're 6'4", right, Kenny? 
[02:43:30]  6'5"?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  After he did that, looking all tough and scary, then proceeds to skip down Newberry Street.  He went skipping.  Well, that's a fancy place.  All right, Kenny, so you're part of the XM Nation now.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Bye, Kenny.  And if you find out who took a dump next year, I'll kick his ass.  Oh, that guy?  Yeah, I don't know.  The sneakers gave away.  All right.  There he goes.  Bye, Kenny.  Club Soda Ken.  Bye, Kenny.  All right.  All right, bye.  Bye.  There he goes.  That was a good appearance by Club Soda Ken. 
[02:44:00]  Of course.  All right, back to the, we're down to the 10 worst songs of all time, Anthony.  We're in Ebony and Ivory right now, discussing how it would be nice to hose down half of  the keys on the piano.  Jeez.  What?  What's wrong with that?  That gets an inappropriate bell.  Yeah, come on.  Oh, my God.  Side by side on my piano keyboard.  My piano.  We're trying to keep our black listeners.  Stop.  I want to, I want to, I was a sarcastic statement about the idiotic comparison on the keyboard. 
[02:44:30]  All right.  Number nine, 10 worst songs of all time.  It's Madonna and, uh.  Oh, yes.  The American Life.  I disagree.  Yeah.  I tried to be a boy.  I tried to be a girl.  Definitely not her best work.  I'm not feeling it.  Are you feeling this?  I am.  I feel, uh, Ray of Light from Madonna.  I really do.  Oh, Ray of Light?  Yeah.  I mean, you know, do what you have to do, but I like the song.  I really do.  I like Material Girl. 
[02:45:00]  Ray of Light is a very cool Madonna song.  What's the chorus?  Because I'm a material girl.  Yeah, what's the chorus of this song?  I do like this song a lot.  When she raps, it makes me want to cut.  This song is awful.  We should have got to the rap part.  Yeah, a lot of, like, uh, tradition, a lot of artists, you know, they feel like they  need to be hip with the music culture, so they decide they need to rap.  Remember when Rush did that rap?  Oh, yeah.  Roll the Bones.  Roll the Bones.  Roll the Bones.  When, uh, yeah, uh, rap was making its first appearance in an entire culture.  Everyone had to incorporate some rap into their music. 
[02:45:30]  Didn't matter who it was.  They're like, well, this will get us on top again.  And they did that awful rap at the end of Roll the Bones.  When, like, REO Speedwagon's rapping, you know, it's pretty unhip today.  Let's do it.  Gene Simmons has some kind of a rap.  I saw Melissa from YSP and she was telling me that Gene Simmons has a tape where he's,  like, wearing a fur and he does some kind of rap on a DVD.  If anybody knows that, I'd love to see that.  All right.  Rapping.  Moving on.  Yeah, but we don't have the rap part.  That's okay.  It's all right.  Uh, in eighth place, ten worst songs of all time.  Eddie Murphy, great comedian. 
[02:46:00]  Oh.  But he, uh, this should be the worst song of all time, actually.  Why?  It's girl parties and it bothers him?  I don't get these guys that, that they're good at something, but they decide they're  bored with that, so they have to go do something.  I don't get that.  Absolutely.  And there's so many people that do that.  Like, Robin Williams is, you know, very funny on film.  I hate his act, but he's very funny on film, but then decides he has to be a serious actor.  Jim Carrey tried that for a little while.  Then you got people like Eddie Murphy. 
[02:46:30]  They need to now be rap stars.  It's like, stick with what you're good at.  And I'll disagree with you with Robin, simply because he's a Juilliard-trained...  Because you're going to work with him someday and you have the same manager?  No, no, no, no, no.  Well, we might as well just throw that on the table.  We do have the same manager.  You pussy.  But I, I, he's an Oscar winner.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  And he's also a Juilliard-trained Shakespearean actor.  So that's not, that's not deviating from what you're good at.  Actually, you know, that is a bad example, because I mean, when he did get serious, he was...  He can act.  He's great.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  That was a bad example. 
[02:47:00]  I'll give it, I'll give you that.  His stream of consciousness.  I love that.  When he just gets up, he could talk about anything and make it funny.  The make it funny part, I'm not really buying.  Me and Colin went downstairs one time, this is before I worked with the same people he does,  to watch him.  And we kind of went down there to go, ugh.  And I got to tell you, we stood there and watched him do 45 minutes of shit that was topical within the week.  Would you pull your fucking head out of his ass right now?  Honestly, he'll never hear this.  I'm telling you.  And Colin even goes, he has a real streak of genius. 
[02:47:30]  The guy's brilliant at times.  I'm telling you, we watched him.  We went down there specifically when he kicks.  You know something?  It was great.  I probably couldn't even listen to him to make that assessment now because all that sticks  in my head is when he's on stage with Billy Crystal and Whoopi and they're riffing on stage  and it's awful.  I don't like Whoopi.  Oh, nowadays, a little Billy Crystal ass kiss now, right?  I like kissing Billy's ass.  Who cares?  Is he part of the same management company?  It's called a team? 
[02:48:00]  So what?  So speaking of Howard Stern, you won't hear me?  Jimmy, say anything bad.  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  What?  Look, can you blame Jimmy, though?  He has a knack.  He's trying to keep his options.  No, I'm not.  When the Titanic goes down, he knows how to jump onto the Lusitania.  Let me tell you something.  That thing sinks.  He's right aboard the Edmund Fitzgerald.  You're the guy that knocked the women and children off the raft to get a space.  Right.  Listen to me.  You're that guy.  Not only did I stay on the Titanic, but I sat in my seat all the way down to the bottom 
[02:48:30]  and waited for someone to come 50 years later and bring it up with the entire crew.  The Lusitania rode by and so did a few other ships, and I went, fuck them.  I'll wait here for this dumb boat to get brought back up.  You know what?  He makes a good point.  Of course I do.  You smashed me in the face with that one.  You're right.  He's a survivor.  You're right.  You know, I talked about Voss the other day.  Norton was the same guy.  He could have went on a lot of shows.  Oh, what ship are you going to go on?  The one where there's a huge, beautiful stateroom, but you would have to stay in the bilge? 
[02:49:00]  I'm not.  Stop it.  That ship wasn't even going to stop for you.  But that's the point I'm making.  He's like, when we were off the air, people say, why don't you trash Howard?  I'll tell you.  Who?  Your quarters is by the stern.  I was never offered to do the show.  They never asked me.  They never approached me.  They probably never would because of my association with you guys.  And I never tried to get on it.  Actors away.  This is where I want to be.  But my problem with trashing him, it's not that I'm afraid to trash him.  It's that you guys have a legitimate problem.  You understand?  And it's two famous people going at each other. 
[02:49:30]  And I feel dishonest jumping on and getting my name in there to trash someone more famous than me who hasn't.  You understand what I mean?  That's why I don't do it.  I've told you that a million times.  I hear you.  I hear you.  It's completely true.  All right.  You weren't involved when there was the gag order on the old show.  Of course.  I was there, but it just...  Of course you weren't.  He knows not to go up to the lifeboat guy and say, listen, if this ship sinks, asshole, I want a seat.  When Howard went to the bosses and said, make Opie Anthony stop talking about me, you weren't doing the radio show. 
[02:50:00]  I absolutely was doing the show, but it was a fight.  And it didn't affect you at all, being one of these martyrs of free speech.  It's not that it didn't affect me or it didn't irritate me, but it's almost for me, it's dishonest for me to start...  It's like Man Cow.  Well, Man Cow, you guys know I'm friends with Man Cow.  I like Cow.  You guys hate him.  And I didn't do the show.  That's true, because he didn't bash Don and Mike.  Don and Mike, I personally didn't like.  I didn't like those guys.  I didn't like them.  Let me tell you the problem. 
[02:50:30]  First of all, they're cornballs, and they're not friends, and I didn't respect what they did.  Let me tell you my problem with Man Cow.  First of all, he's the biggest pussy, and he's been trying to be Anthony and I's friends for years.  He wanted us to get him involved with Infinity Broadcast, and we were big stars over there.  And then stupid Bob in L.A., we had the same agent, was trying to set up a little meet and greet in Chicago  where we'd fly to freaking Chicago, hang out with Man Cow, and have steaks, and try to get on the same team.  We have a lot in common.  We could discuss how we give Bob 10% of our money. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, but the problem is, the guy is a phony.  When we were off the air, he tried to hire all our guys, because his show, quite frankly, blows.  It's not as good as it used to be.  So he knew the success that Ant and I were having, and he actually, you want in on this or no?  I mean, he actually contacted Ben and Steve and everybody and was trying to hire our people  while we were down and out and sitting at home playing with our pods, okay?  And this is the real reason why I think Man Cow is a big, fat, fucking phony.  He goes on Fox when we get fired, and he basically said, you know, I know those guys. 
[02:51:30]  I've talked to those guys, and they are scumbags.  Liar.  Okay, here's the deal.  I've never talked to Man Cow in my life.  Right.  It was always through Bob trying to set things up.  This guy went on TV when we got fired, because they were looking for DJs to talk about Anthony  and I when we did our whole Sex for Sam thing, so they had to dig up all these guys.  Dragged them all out, waddle-doodle.  That never really got national exposure, excuse me.  They got Man Cow, and I forget all the guys. 
[02:52:00]  There's a whole list of them.  It agrees, man.  Yeah, it was Man Cow got in on this.  Oh, well, all right.  This isn't the CD I was looking for, but...  Oh, wait, is it?  Yeah, it is.  Yeah.  Oh, this is what Man Cow said about us on Fox News.  You know, we don't forget anything on this radio show.  We document everything.  I never met this guy.  We're scumbags to him because we didn't talk to him, not because we talked to him.  You know, say what you want about our...  Say, say, say.  Say what you want about our radio show.  I don't really care.  You know, if you think we're dirtbags because you listen to the show and you think we're 
[02:52:30]  not whatever, that's fine.  But to say as a person I'm a dirtbag and you've never met me, now we got a problem.  I mean, my brother literally wants to fly to Chicago and beat the crap out of the guy.  Now you get the hell out of here.  By the way...  This is really long, though.  I just want the part about...  Huh?  I just grabbed it on the fly.  Well, you got to turn up your mic, too, Eric.  It's all right.  We're not going to waste four minutes on his little time in the spotlight over our, you  know, fuck up, so... 
[02:53:00]  Sweetie, when you said Don and Mike before, another difference in that is I was there when  the Don and Mike problem started.  I was there.  I was a part of that whole problem starting.  All right.  And I didn't like those.  But to say that, you know...  They were rude.  I said, hi, the guy wants you to meet me.  Then you met us and you've talked to us and all that and we're dirtbags.  You know, that's whatever, dude.  You know, you're a phony and you know it.  You really are.  All right.  Seventh worst song of all time, Anthony.  It's amazing how we go off doing this ten worst songs ever contest into like these tangents. 
[02:53:30]  Well, because this is the type of radio we do when we're tired.  I like that, though.  It's a flow.  It's the way people talk.  Absolutely.  No one sits around, no one sits in the living room and talks in bits.  You know, blah, blah, blah, blah, four minutes, 15 seconds, back after this.  I like, this is normal.  Exactly.  That's why I hate the other structured shows.  After this commercial, we'll talk about the pizza we just ordered.  That's why I hate the other structured shows, but I won't mention them by name.  Ha, ha.  I've never gone on a...  You never know when the phone will ring.  I've never gone on shows that were a problem for you guys, ever. 
[02:54:00]  We're just...  I know.  I just have to let people know it.  Relax.  The second you have to justify yourself to me...  All right, I know.  Right.  Please.  You guys have to know that, though.  Okay.  Seventh worst song of all time, it's...  Oh, by the way, wait.  The Eddie Murphy one party all the time?  Oh, yeah.  We never even...  It's like, why did he do that?  You were saying that.  Why does somebody go from something they do very well into some other thing that they don't  do very well?  It was 1985.  Eddie Murphy, top of his game.  He had the yes people around him.  You know damn well, he used to do the act on stage where he'd sing a little like Michael 
[02:54:30]  Jackson.  Remember?  And he probably had some people going, man, Eddie, you got some good voice, you know?  Gotts.  And I'm sure they said it just right back.  Didn't he get Rick Rubin or somebody to do this?  Yeah.  He got some Michael Jackson involved.  It was a Rick James song.  Oh, no.  It was Rick James.  Rick James wrote this song.  Yeah, that's right.  Get to your brother.  Charlie Murphy.  God, who knew that Charlie Murphy was so funny?  Charlie Murphy.  Boy, thanks, Eddie.  I know.  If I was Charlie Murphy, I'd be like, thanks, big, well, little bro.  I guess it's a little brother, yeah. 
[02:55:00]  Boy, thanks for throwing me a bone and getting my name out there.  Charlie Murphy on Chappelle's show.  Hilarious.  You got to give Chappelle.  He has to wait until the year 2000 for people to know that Eddie Murphy has a brother that's  funny?  I know.  Jesus, Eddie.  Stop thinking about yourself and trying to pick up chicks with dicks and help your brother  out.  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Let's stop being judgmental.  I couldn't believe that one, though.  Chappelle.  I thought Eddie was an only child.  You got this brother that's probably struggling, doing all sorts of crappy work.  Charlie Murphy. 
[02:55:30]  And he was that funny?  Yeah.  So he probably had guest people all around him.  And, you know, he decides he wants to do a tune.  And they all, yeah, you're great, man.  Do it.  And now he's got to live with this.  But listen to the beat right here.  And he was all serious in the video, remember?  It's like putting on his singing face, trying to be all sexy.  There is something catchy about it, as much as I should be eviscerated for thinking that.  Eviscerated?  Is that how it's pronounced? 
[02:56:00]  Is it not?  I hate when I have to...  I believe it's eviscerated.  I hate...  Eviscerated.  I eviscerated that tortilla.  Oh.  Eviscerated.  It's all right.  It's not all right.  I'm a fucking boob.  We live and learn on this show every day.  That's good to learn in front of, you know, God knows how many people.  Actually, you may have just learned it from Popeye.  Oh, I was eviscerated.  Jim, you can take that call from Howard any time. 
[02:56:30]  Thinking you're meaning something here.  Jesus.  Taking a call from eviscerated.  Robin.  All right.  The seventh worst song of all time.  Yes.  I hate this one.  This bit's going to go on longer than the freaking Red Sox game last night.  Extra innings.  It's, yeah, Bobby McFerrin.  Don't worry.  Look, I'm in the video. 
[02:57:00]  I'm doing wacky stuff.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  Robin Williams was in the video.  Yeah, he was.  In the video.  Trying on different hats and stuff.  Look, I'm putting on wacky hats.  Look, I'm happy.  I'm not worrying.  Yes.  Stop.  Did you like Robin Williams' performance in this video?  I honestly didn't remember that he was in the video.  Why would I ever watch this?  1988, I was...  Look, I'm doing my funny dance.  Yeah.  He was dancing.  Yeah, he put the funny wacky hats on.  And he had that 70s porno mustache during the whole video. 
[02:57:30]  Awful.  I like the song, though.  It's fine.  No, this is horrible.  You don't play your chest as an instrument.  What was his style of music called?  Calypso?  Garbage.  Not Calypso.  No, where he'd play his chest as part of the drums.  No word.  Thank God he was a one-hit wonder, Bobby McFerrin.  Didn't want to hear another one of this.  All right.  Number seven.  Number seven.  1988, by the way.  Okay.  Sixth worst song of all time, according to Blender Magazine.  And this I agree with.  This is a magazine that came out, I do believe, a year ago. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  Huey Lewis in the news.  The heart of rock and roll.  1984, everybody.  You'll listen in to 103.3, the Fox, Buffalo's home of rock and roll.  Spuds Buckley on the way.  Huey Lewis in the news.  I'm more into the Back to the Future stuff.  I have that clip, but I can't find it.  I know.  God damn it.  Have I ever had this much trouble with these things? 
[02:58:30]  No, we haven't.  Remember, I used to be right on it.  Anthony, just so you get the feel of the studio, you know,  I work the phones over here.  Anthony's got this great instant replay machine, but.  Can't use it.  Can't use it, because there's.  There's too much stuff.  There's literally 10,000 clips he could go to,  but the problem is he can't find anything.  I want my basic clip.  I'm going to have to weed some of these out.  Thank you so much, though.  No, I mean that.  You really put a lot of clips.  But it's too much.  There's too many things on this.  What clip were you going to play? 
[02:59:00]  The one from Huey Lewis and the News.  You got that clip?  I got that clip.  Find that clip.  It would have been perfect.  Oh, look at our bank three.  Oh, bank three.  F is a bank three.  God damn.  Where is it?  Oh, where is it?  That's all right.  Go through bank one and two and then get the three.  Because timing isn't really important when you're trying to do a radio show.  Good point.  I.  There's too many of these.  Anthony, I'm going to rewind a little bit.  Too many.  In sixth place.  Worst song of all time.  It's Huey Lewis and the News. 
[02:59:30]  The heart of rock and roll.  Oh, I still can't find it.  Oh, my God.  No, it's not there.  I can't find it.  Oh, boy.  And this writing on here.  My God.  Yeah.  No.  What?  Who wrote that?  You are checking out the growing pains of the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's not on there.  It's either Steve or my handwriting.  Oh, it's awful.  Why don't you just randomly push buttons, Anthony?  You don't want to hire niggas, that's all right.  That has nothing to do with it. 
[03:00:00]  What's the matter with you people?  I was joking.  You're just a tool.  This has nothing to do with the song.  I hate rednecks.  Right.  Oh, Lordy, Lord.  He's desperate.  Do what he says.  Do what he says.  I cannot find that one.  All right.  Until we figure out that machine.  I have too many clips.  Just randomly hit him as we talk here.  Oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  All right.  Huey Lewis and the News.  Let's get to number five, Anthony.  Can I say about Huey Lewis and the News?  Oh, yes.  Yes, Jim. 
[03:00:30]  Can you lower that, please?  He stinks.  That's it?  That's it.  The worst song.  You know what's worse than the heart of rock and roll is we built out.  Oh, wait.  No, that's not him.  What's the other one?  Holy crap.  You just gave away number one.  Now they can go to their local radio station and get their local news and traffic.  Wait, what's the other one he does?  Holy eff.  No, no.  He does another one.  I want a new drug.  I want a new drug.  A heart of soul.  The ones from Back to the Future.  Stuck on you.  Hip to be square.  Hip to be square.  Oh, does he just suck? 
[03:01:00]  He's brilliant.  The power of love.  You think he's brilliant, really?  No.  Oh, jeez.  I actually didn't mind you.  It stinks.  He has a big cock, I heard, though.  I saw him on stage.  He fell.  All right, look.  Did he trip over it?  No, he did a jump at the Worcester Central when he fell down.  He tripped over his big cock.  All right, well, there's just too many.  Too many clips, right?  There's too many.  I'm still looking for that clip on all these.  It's not here.  Ah!  All right, well.  There's no way to type me crazy. 
[03:01:30]  Anthony, there's no way to type those little things out for you, like, onto these, so you don't  have to read the awful handwriting.  I can't.  The handwriting is so small and awful.  It's minuscule.  All right, why don't we move on?  No!  No?  Yes, of course.  My hands won't allow it.  In fifth place, worst song of all time.  Yes.  According to Blender Magazine.  It's Vanilla Ice, everybody.  Ah.  Yo, VIP.  Yo, VIP.  Ice Baby.  From 1990.  I'll agree with that. 
[03:02:00]  This is pretty awful.  Ice Ice Baby.  Even at the time when this was popular and it didn't seem as silly as it even does now,  I didn't like this.  I thought it was awful.  They made him sing it at a karaoke bar on The Surreal Life.  Yeah.  Did anyone see that episode?  Saw that.  Yeah.  Now you got, like, three guys staring at the instant replay trying to figure it out. 
[03:02:30]  Just trying to find it.  Because now it's just something that's pissing me off that I can't find it on here.  Can you say OCD?  OCD.  OCD.  I can't hear you.  What?  We got to turn off the mics for a second?  All right.  Hold on.  No, that clip would work, too.  But Anthony doesn't know where that one is, either.  Holy sugar.  There's a lot of clips.  Which one's that?  You know, from...  Yeah.  Oh.  Who knows where that is?  Good old George C. would be very nice right here. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, I don't know where that is.  All right.  Hey, could no flames today help you find it?  What's the matter?  Because it's raining out?  You decided not to wear any flame gear?  Uh, that mic doesn't work.  Talking to the dead mic there, stupid.  Wow, I wonder why that doesn't work today.  I look at those streaks and horror when I get close to them.  Wait, did you see the goddamn boots I bought yesterday?  Somebody actually emailed after they heard him ripping me about the flame shirts.  And they said, don't let him give you any crap about that.  Check out these boots.  Steve. 
[03:03:30]  Untuck.  Yeah.  Please.  Please.  Untuck.  There you go.  Don't you feel a little better?  Don't you feel a little...  Look at that.  You look...  You look...  It makes you look slimmer, too.  All right, fine.  You like Huey Lewis and the News?  Oh, my God.  All the clips are just that one.  You like Huey Lewis and the News?  What?  But we're doing vanilla eyes now.  Don't fall for that old gag.  No.  See, the Huey Lewis and the News line...  You like Huey Lewis and the News?  ...is nowhere near... 
[03:04:00]  All right.  Don't stare at it.  Eat it.  Eat it.  Okay, let's move on.  Ice Ice Baby, you have anything on Vanilla Ice, Anthony?  No, I just thought he...  Mr. OCD?  Pretty bad.  What?  I thought it was pretty bad at the time.  I do like the fact that Suge Knight hung him out the window until he signed over some  residuals.  I like that.  Great story.  And can I point out to Steve, if you don't know what Steve looks like, watch Midnight  Express, and when the guy brings his two awful kids in with their shirts tucked in,  that's who he looks like with his shirt tucked in. 
[03:04:30]  Wow.  That is great.  Nice.  Perfect.  There's two awful kids after he's beating the guy's feet with a stick.  He just stops, grabs his kids...  Holds their little fat hands and walks out.  Walks out.  Little non-bowling Lebanese child hands.  Okay, so Ice Ice Baby comes in fifth place.  In fourth, I just completely disagree here.  This is where they have to put something newer in so people get into the list, I guess.  Right.  I don't know the song.  Fourth worst song of all time. 
[03:05:00]  It's a band that...  And I go way back with, actually.  Right.  Did one of the first interviews with Fred Durst.  Limp Bizkit.  Limp Bizkit.  And Rolling.  How did this make number four?  This is worse than Kokomo by the Beach Boys?  I don't think so.  It is kind of whiny.  I don't like this song, but it doesn't deserve number four. 
[03:05:30]  No.  This is worse than Lionel Richie's Dancing on the Ceiling?  It's a good tune, though.  No.  Worse than Hanging Tough by New Kids on the Block?  No.  That's why these lists are just a waste of time,  and radio guys should not be doing them.  This is worse than Gerardo's Rico Suave.  Did Rico Suave make the list?  Yes, it did.  Number 37, Opie.  Wow.  Okay.  There you go.  So Limp Bizkit comes in number four.  Number three, another song I kind of like.  It's one of those guilty pleasures, they call it. 
[03:06:00]  It's a song, a staple of the 80s, very nostalgic when it comes on,  and I defy you, if you live through the 80s,  to turn it off when it comes on the radio.  Very hard to.  Oh, no, it's not.  In third place, it's Wang Chung.  Come on, everybody.  Remember this?  We're all having fun tonight.  It's Wang Chung coming in.  In third place, worst song of all time. 
[03:06:30]  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Oh.  It's called the guilty pleasure end.  Right.  Wang Chung.  That sucks.  And what does Wang Chung mean?  I don't know.  But it's never good when the band's name is in the song.  Right.  It's like Dice when he was doing Dicey Dice.  Dicey Dice.  I'm over here now.  Because you said what? 
[03:07:00]  All right.  Well, it looks like somebody forgot the rules of radio.  Is it Bob?  Is it our super agent, Bob Eatman?  Hello.  What?  Yeah.  What?  Really?  How are you, bro?  You don't say.  You don't say.  Everything all right?  You don't say.  Who was it?  All right.  He didn't say.  What's going on?  By the way, we're getting criticized on the instant feedback.  Uh-oh.  Dude, why are you calling during the show?  Hey, faggots, why do you care what Steve is wearing? 
[03:07:30]  What?  You know?  Uh-oh.  A little payback for us saying.  That's right.  We shouldn't care.  And we care so much what Steve wears.  Steven is filming.  He just nailed us.  What's going on, O?  Can we say something on the air yet?  Oh, he hung up on me.  Who is it?  Oh, just a little friend.  Why'd he hang up on you?  Because he realized you were live and we could.  I don't like you being disrespected like that.  We could blow a big secret.  Does it have something to do with us?  Oh, yeah.  Does it have something to do with this radio show?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:08:00]  All right.  But it's not as big as everyone is speculating.  Who was it?  Well, I got it right.  Because we did.  Remember we signed something?  Oh, we did?  Remember?  I know I signed a lot of stuff.  I never.  I haven't signed anything.  Pay attention to it, though.  Let's see.  Opie.  Come on.  Oh, right.  Okay.  I got you.  But there's a lot of speculation out there.  It's not as big as people are thinking.  Right.  But it's still pretty cool.  We're not allowed to say because we signed a stupid contract.  Can I make one point, though, what Wang Chung means?  I do know what that means.  Yeah.  It means take off a baby diaper with your teeth. 
[03:08:30]  Really?  Let it bomb.  I was sitting on it too long.  If I had fired it.  I'll accept it.  The streak is finally over.  Dude, if I had fired it out at the moment, because you were saying what Wang Chung means.  Cal Ripken finally had to sit out a game because you've been on fire.  That's right.  He finally had to take a seat.  That's right.  Take a seat on the bench and let one of the new guys go in and take his place.  Can I say something?  If I'm going to end my streak, God damn it, I'm proud to end it on a line like that. 
[03:09:00]  Whew.  All right.  Maybe we'll get it on the way home.  Nope.  No?  Oh, you got it up to the part where Mancow says he met us and stuff?  Yeah.  You want to play that really fast?  This is what Mancow said.  Well, now there's a panic in that other room.  Why?  Because they're both thinking of different things.  Are they fighting over whose hair is better suited for the gay community?  Oh, back in the game.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:09:30]  There you go.  The rookie went 0 for 4.  They had to bring Cal back in.  It was a false alarm.  Only a minor strain on the hamster.  I think it was all that pine tar on your helmet.  Please, guys.  All right.  You got it, Steve?  So I'll set it up again.  Never, never met Mancow.  Never talked to Mancow.  But all these jocks had a great opportunity when Anthony and I effed up with the Sex for  Sam thing, and they were all over national TV.  They were scrambling for guys to talk about us.  Half the people that were on TV during that time never met us, never listened to the show. 
[03:10:00]  Half?  Most?  A lot more than half.  I'm being kind, I guess.  Did Greaseman trash you or no?  Huh?  Greaseman?  Did he trash you or just, he was kind of actually right.  He was using that opportunity to try to get back into radio and win back the public opinion.  And most of these guys said that Anthony and I would never work in radio again, by the  way.  Waddle doodle.  Hey, I'm back on the air.  The Greaseman Show.  Hey, you know why?  Why are black people so tall?  Because they're Negroes. 
[03:10:30]  Get it?  Negroes.  Thank you.  No, it didn't work.  I'm not back.  Waddle doodle.  Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  But yeah, Mancow felt like he knew us so well that he needed to get on and get some FaceTime.  And listen to this fake radio hack voice.  And he said this.  These guys are dirtbags.  I know these guys.  We have the same agent.  That's the only thing I feel bad about.  I don't want my guy to lose money over these two jag-offs, as we would call them in Chicago. 
[03:11:00]  You know, they're bad guys.  C'est la vie.  Goodbye.  Don't lump everybody in with these idiots.  Oh, dude.  You know, that's really getting me worked up, man.  Lump in with these idiots.  Guess who's trying to get on satellite radio?  That is really getting me worked up.  Guess who's seen our names in the press a lot and is like, hmm, there's my future.  Yeah, through our mutual agent.  Hey, work a deal out so I can get on satellite radio, too. 
[03:11:30]  Could you do that?  Because these two jag-offs, that's how we talk in Chicago, jag-off.  You're a jag-off, you dickbag.  You fuck me.  You did not sit down with all our people to try to make your show better, but we stink that bad, right?  We stink that bad that you called Ben and Steve and I think even Stinky, right?  Or was it just you and Steve?  A lot of people, because he wanted to restructure his show because the people around him he hates.  Don't lump me in with all these people.  They're saying, you know, these jag-offs. 
[03:12:00]  What, lump yourself in with people that have a national name in the business?  I'm sorry.  I'm really sorry.  What an ass.  How's that whip it out Wednesday going for you?  Yeah.  Because guys want to see cocks on the road, you idiot.  Oops.  I made a mistake.  I called it whip it out Wednesday.  It's supposed to be whip them out Wednesday.  Whip it out means pull your cock out like Man Cow likes it.  He had bumper stickers and everything made that said, whip it out Wednesday.  That's smart.  What a fake, over-energetic dick bag. 
[03:12:30]  There's one more clip left.  It's 30 seconds if you want to hear that.  Sure, why not?  I like when Anthony gets all pissed off.  I, I, eh.  Okay.  My conversation with my managers, they know I'm never going to have, uh, people having  sex in a church.  I mean, listen to what we're saying.  Listen to the fact that we're debating this.  Is it so many years of Clinton that we even debate this?  Uh, they had sex in a church.  You're, you're done.  You don't deserve, uh, to have the tool of, of radio anymore.  You're, goodbye.  See you later, losers.  Don't let the door hit you on the ass, uh, on the way out. 
[03:13:00]  So I can't even believe we're debating this.  And, uh, what are managers saying?  To me, they're saying nothing.  Because they know I would never do something, uh, so stupid.  Shut up.  And after that, man, Cal, you did not call my people trying to get in a meeting with  me personally.  You didn't, right?  Like, I was hearing things.  Like, I don't understand why Opie and Anthony, uh, won't sit down and talk with me.  That didn't happen, right?  I, I just want to make sure that didn't happen.  I want to make sure you didn't call Ben and Steve and, uh, try to hire them when they  were out of work and Ant and I were out of work trying to get our careers 
[03:13:30]  back together.  That didn't happen either, right?  Because we're such dirtbags and don't know what we're doing on the radio, right?  All these.  Just want to make sure.  Want to make sure that that didn't happen.  All these guys, they were so brave when we were thrown off the fucking air.  They were so, then they took the opportunity to get on every show they could and, and  call us, uh, Jag-offs.  We're some of the others, man.  We're riled up.  Get some other ones on.  Get some other ones on.  They knew we were going to be sitting for two fucking years.  So, so. 
[03:14:00]  So then they took their shots.  That's when they take their shots.  That's when Howard Stern started saying, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, Opie and  Anthony.  And the brave, witty, witty man-cock, uh, decides that that's when he's going to get  out again and all these guys are losers.  You know, I talk to my people, my managers.  That's when he's going to be the big brave guy.  What a bunch of pussy asses.  And they all did it and we had to sit at home for like a couple years and just eat it.  However, I hope you're having fun doing your pablum milk toast show over there, uh, man, 
[03:14:30]  douchebag, cockhead.  Hope you're having fun.  Hope you're having fun being scrutinized with every word that comes out of your untalented,  shitty mouth.  I hope you're having fun.  Hope you're having fun, uh, uh, with the risk of getting fined if you talk about anything.  Anything.  And I hope you have fun when you get thrown off the air.  I love how...  And, and, and, and the, the, the know-it-alls gather around and go on Fox News and CNN and  start bashing your untalented, stupid ass. 
[03:15:00]  And all these guys are looking at us now and they are so frustrated and jealous.  Yeah.  Not quite, didn't quite get hit on the ass with the door, did we, man-cock?  Yeah, sh-wook.  What a goon.  Another hypocrite.  Your buddy there, uh, I know him a long time.  That's your buddy.  No, I know, see, I know you've known him a long time and, you know, whatever, you know.  My buddy, my buddy, wherever I go, he goes, my buddy.  Yes, sex bagel.  I have one more clip, which is from the very beginning of the Fox News piece, if you want 
[03:15:30]  to hear that.  All right, let's hear this.  Okay.  Bah!  Honestly, I think it's like, uh, do other corporate guys look up to the Enron officials?  I think these guys were bad eggs, Opie and Acne, not a fan, didn't like those people.  And I think this is as easy as it gets.  And what scares me is the woman, you got that email, uh, Karen from Michigan, you put that  up.  Uh, let's get rid of all of them.  The fact is, you know, Dan Rather called what I have to say, uh, hate radio.  They call Bill O'Reilly hate TV. 
[03:16:00]  Uh, what I do is not shock radio.  I have an opinion.  It doesn't go along with, uh, the liberal media.  And so, therefore, I'm labeled a shock jock.  Look, look, I study being a minister, John.  Uh, these people having sex in a church, they're filthy, they're animals, and I don't like being  lumped in with them.  And frankly, I don't think they should ever be allowed to work again.  Oh, good, good.  You don't think we should ever be allowed to work again.  Thank God.  I'm going home.  I'm going home.  What a dick.  Yeah, he doesn't like the fact that a couple allegedly had sex in a church because he studied  to be a minister.  But he had no problem with us when, uh, he realized that we could help his career. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, the Reverend Martin Luther Mancow, minister.  What a guy.  Fuck off, you tool.  What a dick.  And he had that comment about us personally.  He never, ever talked to us or met us.  Have fun.  I refuse, Bob, because, you know, we have the same agent from time to time calls.  Come on, Mick.  You know, maybe, you know, he's going to be in New York.  Maybe you guys can get together, see what happens.  I'm like, Bob, do you watch TV, you idiot? 
[03:17:00]  I hear what's going on.  I hear his ratings are in the shitter because he's had to change his show so much because  of the FCC regulations.  Well, all of a sudden he decided he wants to be Sean Hannity and there's only one Sean  Hannity.  You can't be Sean Hannity.  He'll be gone soon, just like everyone on regular radio.  And by that time, sorry, we'll probably be all full up over here.  What an ass.  Ugh.  You got more, right?  Eric made a whole freaking, like, volume of people that trashed us on the trash. 
[03:17:30]  That's all we have in Man Cow on Fox News.  Oh, what a shame.  We'll break out another one maybe tomorrow or later, okay?  All right, very good.  I'm sure he's on the phone, hot and heavy, trying to call Stern so he can end up on Stern's  little network.  Yeah, I hate that guy.  Call up Bob.  Could you see if you could get me in there?  What a weaselly, liar, jerk-off. 
[03:18:00]  Ugh.  Ah.  Ugh.  That felt good.  Mm.  Mm-mm-mm.  Yeah.  One of those radio weasel guys that behind the scenes are just doing stuff and they try  to put on this persona on the air like they're someone else.  Just stop it already.  Your phony act is so transparent.  It's so weird.  A lot of people listen to the guys that will never work in radio again.  It's very strange.  Yeah, again, we're never going to work again.  I remember the first time we weren't going to work again when ass-wipes like Charles Laquadera 
[03:18:30]  were bashing us in Boston.  Remember when he was on the morning shows?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  After we got fired?  Legendary morning guy in Boston.  Saying how we're done.  Right.  I hope a volcano explodes on you in Hawaii or wherever the fuck you are.  And getting bashed by Mark Perenno was fun, too.  Did he bash you guys?  When we got fired.  Of course he did.  Of course he did.  Getting bashed by him.  Another one.  Great.  You got any Playstations to give away to young black boys before you fuck them in the ass?  Huh?  No?  All out, I guess. 
[03:19:00]  All out, I guess.  Another genius.  Another genius who was bashing us.  And then Mancock.  Sitting there in Chicago with his ratings plummeting.  Plummeting because of restrictions.  He can't do the shocking show.  Like Hope you said, he wants to now be a political talker.  Good luck.  Good luck.  It's hard to go to political talk when you're shoving stuff up chicks' asses in your studio.  We know.  Yeah.  We blew that a long time ago.  At least we're not phony about it.  We can't run for office.  We know that. 
[03:19:30]  Old mongoloid head Tom Likas.  Another one.  They all jumped on the bandwagon.  Had a lot of fun at our expense.  It was so easy to jump on our show when we weren't on the air anymore.  Howard.  Gotta keep saying Howard.  Howard, another one.  Howard with finally saying our names because he knew we couldn't fight back at that point.  Oh, my God.  Please.  Howard, the biggest pussy out there that only goes after people he knows he can beat up on the air.  Guy would run to Mel Karmazin.  When it comes down to a real challenge, oh, no.  You're not going to hear Howard really go after us.  Anytime we bash him. 
[03:20:00]  We make fun of Howard's girls' tits.  Yeah.  You know, but Imus made fun of Howard's girlfriend, and Howard went right on the air with Imus  and beat the crap out of him.  Threatened to sue.  But here we are talking about Howard Stern's daughter's tits.  Yeah.  And how juicy and big they are, and the pussy has nothing to say.  These guys are a bunch of phonies when it comes down to it.  Oh, but off the air, all you heard was, well, I'll be an Anthony.  What a couple of idiots.  Make them shut up, Mel.  They're going to ruin it for everybody.  Make them shut up, Mel. 
[03:20:30]  Make them shut up, Mel.  Well, Mel's not around anymore.  Nah.  All of them.  And your company hates you, and they're trying to figure out how to get you off the air,  you idiot.  So brave.  They're so brave.  Running behind the scenes.  We made...  Man Cow running to our staff to hire them.  Howard running to Mel Carmisen to shut us up.  Unbelievable.  Don and Mike running, trying to get any job they can.  Trying to jump into whatever slot we were on, but they sucked so fucking bad, that even 
[03:21:00]  though there was a vacuum after we left, they wouldn't put them on our stations.  No, they soaked up a few of our stations and blew it.  Big time.  Yeah, they blew it.  They went into YSP.  They went into YSP and ate it bad.  They're eating it bad in Buffalo.  Are they really?  Oh, yeah, they are.  Those guys are funny, though.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, sure they are.  Another couple of geniuses.  Oh, just a void.  There you go.  All right, so...  What are we up to?  Number two?  What song are we on now, Boo Boo? 
[03:21:30]  Everybody have fun tonight.  Hi, Boo Boo.  Wang Chung was in third place.  Worst songs of all time.  Hey, Frida!  Oh, boy, when that lifeless twat would call in.  Here's another 40 minutes of dead radio air.  Catch up on your reading, folks.  Ugh!  Window?  Yeah.  Oh, I heard stories.  It's great.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Window story.  And the partner is sitting there looking for a rope and a stool? 
[03:22:00]  How do you tell a guy, look, your wife is just devoid of anything interesting to say.  Can you shut her up?  You know damn well if there's two radio guys on a show together, they're doing a program together,  the last thing the one wants is for the other one's wife to make an appearance every day.  Yep.  And you can tell by the way he goes, oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Oh, golly, that Frida.  Here she goes.  Oh, gosh.  Good golly, she's on again.  Don't get her started. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, God.  Good golly.  Oh, John.  Could you just crack her over the head with a fucking cinder block when you get home?  Oh, and boo-boo, remember you came in one time and forgot to take off your shoes?  Oh, gosh, she's telling the shoe story.  Ech.  You're listening to it.  But not a word.  Ech.  But not a peep out of any of them while we're on the air.  Although, did they trash you when you guys were off the air?  Of course.  I don't know if they did.  Of course they did.  No, no.  Know what happened?  If you start defending them in any way whatsoever, Norton, I swear I'll come over there and hit you. 
[03:23:00]  Know what happened?  I'm asking you because I remember they went off the air, and my thing was, did they trash you?  Because what they did, which to me was just awful, was they played ding-dong, the witch is dead.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, no one was allowed to mention your name, so that was their idea.  Well, an edict came down from corporate, you know, to make believe Opie and Anthony are dead.  They started by, you know, abusing us, and then, yeah, then the edict came down, and then they listened to their bosses.  This is an edict. 
[03:23:30]  What's that?  It's a thing.  Edict?  An edict.  Ah.  Is that like an eviscoration?  No, my word is actually a real word.  Maybe I butchered it a little bit.  You what?  I butchered it a little bit.  Eviscorated.  No, I won't defend that.  I don't like them.  No, sir, I don't like them.  I don't like them.  Not a bit.  All right.  Number two.  The runner-up of the worst song of all time, according to Blender Magazine.  Let's hit the vinyl here and listen to Billy Ray Cyrus. 
[03:24:00]  Oh.  Oh, you're going to piss off the truckers now.  Well, achy, breaky heart from 1992.  This started a huge trend of country line dancing.  Oh, I thought you meant places that were never doing country line dance.  I thought you meant the trend was mullets.  The mullet.  Yes, Billy Ray did start the mullet.  And some people just haven't learned and haven't given it up yet. 
[03:24:30]  Billy Ray Cyrus, achy, breaky heart.  Yeah.  And then everybody, even goddamn shitty folk, concrete walking shitty people, were doing line dancing.  This was the song that started that craze?  Yeah.  Very big.  And my friend, Eric McMahon, he's a comedian I know, who's very funny, but he did a bit  where he sang achy, breaky back about a person whose back hurt.  And it's something he obviously stopped doing probably in late 92. 
[03:25:00]  And I'll never let him forget that he did it.  Why does he stop?  Why did he stop doing it?  I guess it's like when Kevin Meany can do the we are the world bit.  Hey, I love Kevin Meany.  Me too.  I also love Eric McMahon.  But when I think of achy, breaky back, I want to give a good Clint of Kinte swash to  his foot.  But don't you break my back, my achy, breaky back.  Don't chop my foot, my achy, breaky foot. 
[03:25:30]  What happened, Opie?  I don't know.  That might have been my fault.  I don't know.  Thank you.  What's that on your shirt?  Oh, Oompa Loompas.  I like it.  Hey, he's got an Oompa Loompa shirt.  Look at the intern trying to kiss her ass.  I love it.  That's nice.  Hey, all right.  He goes, I'm going to come in with that.  I'll show him.  He'll notice.  He's like, the guys haven't even said hi to me yet.  They don't even know my name.  Maybe this will get me noticed.  Look, it's working.  What? 
[03:26:00]  Look at him trying to get his head close to the mic.  Danny.  Hey, Danny.  Yeah.  Danny.  Danny.  Come to the mic, Danny.  Did you have that shirt or did you just have it made?  No, actually, I went to an art supply store.  I got some heat transfers.  And you just made it?  Yeah.  This guy wants to be noticed.  I like that.  I like that, too.  I think it'd be nice if the whole crew had some Oompa Loompa shirts.  Plus, I have no life, so.  Hey, could you bring in Oompa Loompa shirts for everybody?  Absolutely.  I'd like an XL.  How about you make up a Hey, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on shirt?  Yeah.  Are you a prop comic?  Or how about a, I'm on the voyeur bus, wink. 
[03:26:30]  You know, we'll all have our little things on shirts.  I want the staff to walk around in Oompa Loompa shirts.  I absolutely agree.  Oh, good point.  Maybe you could get some flames painted on one in case anybody wants the Wonka factory  on fire.  Very good.  I love that shirt.  It's great.  All right, good.  What nationality are you?  Just your average white guy.  All right, good.  So you're clipped.  I like that.  All right.  What was his name again?  What was your name again?  Danny.  Danny.  Danny.  Danny.  Sit down, Danny. 
[03:27:00]  I'd never hurt you, Danny.  I wouldn't hurt one hair on that Oompa Loompa's head on your shirt.  All right, Anthony.  The number one worst song of all time.  Yes.  And I do agree with this.  Me, too.  This is an awful, awful song.  The worst.  It's We Deliver Keggers by Nicky and Friends.  No?  Anyone?  No.  Bueller?  No?  Okay.  Someone out there got it.  They used to be called Jefferson Airplane.  Remember? 
[03:27:30]  Way back when?  Then they were called Airplane.  Yeah.  And then they were called Jefferson Starship, I believe.  I'm trying to remember all the...  Yeah.  And then finally, Starship.  Pan Am 103?  It's We Built This City, everybody.  Ah.  The worst song of all time.  1985.  According to Blender Magazine.  I was working in Rochester Radio when this was a hit, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  And they personalized the song for all the cities. 
[03:28:00]  Well, there's the middle part where they do, I guess, like a traffic report.  And if you're driving in the middle of the can of worms, we got some backups.  It's going to delay your arrival at work today.  And you're on Long Island.  And you're listening to...  Babe, you're on the LIE.  Right.  You're listening to WCMF, Rochester's home of rock and roll, because every city has to  have a home of rock and roll.  Well, Opie worked for three homes of rock and roll in his radio career.  He started at Rochester's home of rock and roll, then went on to Buffalo's home of rock 
[03:28:30]  and roll, and then actually went home to work for Long Island's home of rock and roll.  That was really your home of rock and roll.  That was my true home of rock and roll.  Yes, Anthony.  WBAB in Babylon.  Right.  Your home of rock and roll.  Yes.  What happened?  We were having fun and riffing on that song.  Yeah.  That song...  And all of a sudden it went off.  What happened?  You decided that the bits stunk and you...  Sex bagel!  No, that was the song that was in the archive here.  Just a piece of it?  That's all... 
[03:29:00]  That's smart, actually.  That is actually smart.  Give someone credit who at least did that.  They cut it short to 57 seconds.  All right.  Were we supposed to play anything into breaks?  We've been talking for an hour and a half.  Have we really?  Yeah, we really have.  Frenchy's been text messaging me because he's dying for his appearance.  All right.  We got two French men on the line.  I really got to just take a leak.  Oh, can I go with you?  No.  No.  Yeah, why do you have to take leaks with all of us?  Because you only have a certain amount of times to urinate.  Am I the only one?  Am I going to pee while you're in the studio?  Am I the only one?  And why do you have to lean back uncomfortably? 
[03:29:30]  Why?  Because I turn around and talk about the show a little bit.  Because they do...  I have to explain.  They do have the granite walls in between.  And that are pretty far up.  Yeah, don't remind me.  Like freaking Jim has to...  Like we're talking.  And all of a sudden he just kind of moves out a little further than most people.  Yeah.  I'm like, what are you doing?  He wants to show off that hog of his...  I've seen it.  All his friends have seen it.  That's true.  You've seen it and worked on.  I watched him get blown by a listener of the show in the middle of Times Square.  Right in the middle of Times Square.  In my car.  She... 
[03:30:00]  All right.  I can tell this little story.  Have we told this one yet?  A little shitty.  I don't believe we have.  There was a girl that came in for a 55-gallon drum challenge.  She took an all-night...  Can I say the city?  I mean, she's very cool, but...  Say about...  Yeah, just give the distance.  Don't say the city, just in case you had a fellow.  At least 450 miles?  About that, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Let's call it 500 miles.  All right.  She took an all-night bus.  An all-night bus to be on our radio show.  Not hard to fill in the blanks for that one.  To participate. 
[03:30:30]  One of these buses where...  I know.  Where it stopped in all the little towns on the way.  Yeah.  I'm not kidding.  All night.  Like a 12-hour bus ride.  Okay?  And she came in and she did the show and stuff.  But she was also doing Jim Norton.  In the bathroom during the commercial breaks.  Oh.  You guys came back.  Norton.  I remember you going, where's Norton?  And I was banging her over a toilet.  Ah.  She banged this girl over a toilet while we were trying to do a radio show.  Another story that will be in the Opie and Anthony book.  Coming out soon.  Mm.  If we ever get down to writing it. 
[03:31:00]  Is Lydia still calling us?  I don't know.  She just left me a message.  She did?  Sure did.  She calls me and it's like...  I'm writing about the voyeur bus.  I want to be good.  I want to say that I'm writing.  But I'm not writing.  All right.  I don't have time.  So...  I'm trying to sleep.  Watch Yankees.  While Anthony and I are trying to put this fine program together, Norton's in the men's  bathroom banging her over a toilet.  Yeah. 
[03:31:30]  Right?  She was...  It was, I believe, in the doggy position, right?  She was holding onto the toilet?  She was standing up, bent over, and I was just knee-deep in box.  What bathroom?  In the men's room of the old N.E.W. building.  Which one?  The studio bathroom?  Not the crunch one, no, no, but the one in the back body offices.  You know, where the creepy guy used to clean when we were in there.  Oh, in the stalls?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He went into a stall and banged her over the toilet.  Yes.  It's a true story.  And then...  I do remember that.  Didn't you pull out and do it on her back?  I think I did, actually.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I remember talking about it.  Because that's what a real man does.  No, a real man leaves it in and says, it ain't my problem, Cookie. 
[03:32:00]  That's what a real man does.  My last name is Smith.  That's the beauty of looking like me.  Oh, yeah.  Cookie.  I've seen his act so much.  I forgot that was a bit, actually.  That's the beauty of looking like me.  You don't have to worry about her actually having the kid.  Any girl I get pregnant is going to throw herself down the stairs.  It saves me 50 bucks, so I don't have to hire a homeless guy to push her.  Just watch.  I love that bit.  The girl Jimmy knocked up, trying in vain to punch herself in the stomach real hard.  I just can't get the velocity needed to punch and feel a puncture and a fluid drain and 
[03:32:30]  a little, as we say, lump on the old linoleum.  Ma'am, there's a lump on your linoleum.  I know.  I put it there.  All right.  So he bangs her over the toilet.  We finished the show.  Now, the girl, I'm not kidding, was on a bus all night, so you think maybe Jim would  do the right thing and maybe take her out to dinner or anything after the show?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  What time does your bus leave? 
[03:33:00]  We were off the air at 7, and I think her bus left 8, safe to say, because it's now the  all-night bus back to Name City here.  She traveled all that distance on a bus just so Jim could bang her in a bathroom.  And she was a trooper because on the way down to-  The bus area.  No, I'm-  Oh, yeah.  I'm throwing a blank.  Port Authority.  We're going through Times Square, and she goes down on Jim while I'm in the backseat  because we were going to go have dinner. 
[03:33:30]  Wait, you were in the backseat?  Yeah, because we were going to have dinner.  Who was driving?  Jimmy.  Oh, so you were driving, and she was giving you a head?  Yeah, because we had to get her to the Port Authority.  And so-  Oh, my God.  You got him so bad.  Really bad.  So I'm in the backseat, and she goes down, and then Norton's all excited, like, check this  out, and moves to the freaking rearview mirror.  He so likes to share.  And it's in the middle of Times Square.  I mean, it was really-  It was the middle of summer, I think, so there were people everywhere.  It's still light out because it's summertime, obviously. 
[03:34:00]  And, yeah, and Jimmy's-  You were sporting about nine that day.  It felt like nine.  It's not nine, unfortunately.  It was ridiculous.  Times Square, the ball dropping into her mouth.  And then dropped her off at the Port Authority for her long bus ride back, back to her home.  Hopeless romantic.  What better thing for a girl?  You have sex over a toilet, you perform oral sex in the car, you get back on the bus.  That's how you treat a lady face over the bowl.  And it didn't even have a lid. 
[03:34:30]  You know, those public restrooms that just have a seat and no lid, so you're looking  into this, you know, water-filled hole?  I just don't understand why you don't have a girlfriend.  Look, I took a girl out recently who I liked, and every time I like a girl or I treat her  nice or I want to have dinner, they blow me off, so I'm done being nice.  Done being nice?  So you're done doing nice things like-  No, but this was a girl I took out.  We just had dinner.  I didn't even hit on her.  I just kissed her on the cheek or whatever, but I guess she didn't think, whatever, who 
[03:35:00]  cares what she thought, but enough with her.  Do you think at some point in your life, do you have this image that you're going to  be a very lonely old guy?  I'm a lonely young guy.  Why wouldn't I be?  Yes.  Okay, I was just checking.  But the bottom line is, I have tried to date here and there, like, you know, hey, maybe  this could be nice, and they always wind up not- I had one girl who was supposed to come  see me recently, who I haven't seen in a year.  Hey, I'll see you in a little while.  It's raining.  She never shows up driving.  So, like, I'm really starting to worry that she's been killed in an accident.  Oh, yeah.  And you're going to get blamed for it.  No, no, no. 
[03:35:30]  Because there's going to be those seeds on the back or, you know, telltale sounds of  me laughing and going, look what you get now, bitch.  But I hope she's all right.  I haven't seen her in a month.  Yeah.  That was a nice way to end the segment with my boring, I hope she's all right.  Cares what I hope.  I hope David Ortiz is raping her corpse.  Jesus.  Vokey and Anthony's Hot Team News.  Oh, yes, Anthony, this just in.  Is this an alert?  A news alert? 
[03:36:00]  This is the Amber Alert, uh, no, actually.  Hot Team News Alert.  Unfortunately, the Amber Alert is not going to help this fine young teen.  Oh, no.  Teen slain, slain in Harlem Restaurant.  Oh.  A 14-year-old girl was shot inside a Chinese restaurant in Harlem last night.  Police and relatives said.  La Chiqua.  Melissa.  Oh.  Had been inside the China House Restaurant on 108th Street.  Oh, boy.  First mistake.  They're asking for it.  At about 830, when she became involved in a dispute with a male teen, witnesses said 
[03:36:30]  he fired five shots, hitting the girl twice.  Damn.  She was hit in the neck and chest.  As she collapsed outside a building several blocks away, she was pronounced dead at St.  Luke's Hospital.  What could you be arguing about in a Chinese restaurant where you shoot a girl in the neck?  That many times.  Damn.  And this is very strange.  I think this is the wrong reaction, but it says her mother was hysterical.  Yeah.  I mean, unless somebody.  Oh, hysterical, you know, can be two things. 
[03:37:00]  Oh.  Oh, the other hysterical.  Could be laughing.  Oh.  Hysterical.  Oh.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Maybe it was a description of the mother's personality.  Oh, her mother's hysterical.  Like, maybe she cracked up the EMS guys.  Yeah, yeah.  The mother was hysterical, you know.  Even though this had happened, she was still hysterical.  Yeah.  I got you.  Maybe her mother said, well, her boyfriend always gave her a shot in the neck, but not  like this, you know, and elbowed one of the EMS guys' ribs.  And he went, you're hysterical.  The paper heard it, printed it.  Sure.  And that includes your hot tea news for today. 
[03:37:30]  Here's Bernie with the weather.  What did I say?  That includes.  Did I say includes?  I hope so, because I just corrected you.  Concludes.  I feel like a real dick, because I'm wrong.  Concludes.  Concludes.  See?  Wait, battle of the French people.  Oh, we're going to do the French people next.  Yes, we should do that.  Let's listen in on a show prep meeting in the Opie and Anthony Laboratory.  Oh, my.  Oh.  Oh, my God, baby. 
[03:38:00]  Hey, guys, anyone want a bitch?  Though I have always been a fool for long, I have finally met my score.  I got a girl, and I don't mean to boast, but she loves me the most.  Even though she's a highly paid whore.  She'll give head to a sheik. 
[03:38:30]  She can stuff three cocks in her cheek.  But she comes home to me.  She'll do the groom and the best man.  She'll slap your ass in the back of a man.  But she comes home to me.  She could fuck nine guys in a row, but still have a tenth for me. 
[03:39:00]  And I'm the only one who gets to kiss them lips, unless you pay an extra fifty.  So, mister, don't you fall in love, cause I'm the only cat who doesn't wear a glove.  Since her heart belongs to me.  She has a throat that just won't quit. 
[03:39:30]  But she can take all of it.  I still have room for your balls, but she shops in the malls for me.  She'll say twelve, then call back and say one.  But I don't care, I know it's just work, not fun.  When she blows through jack, don't you think she's not thinking of me.  She'll go down on a yak, lick her horse's nutsack, but strictly for a catch. 
[03:40:00]  And it's only me who doesn't pay a fee to watch her put a water bottle in her gash.  Put a water bottle in her gash.  She'll let you suck her nips till they're leaking.  But don't you dare try to go and taking.  Cause she does that with me. 
[03:40:30]  Her boys is sweet as honey.  But when she moans, it's just for the money.  Unless she's sitting on me.  She'll damn your asshole with a mouse.  But she won't do it in our house.  Tough luck, Jack.  She knows that don't fly with me.  She might eat your wife's box. 
[03:41:00]  But she won't tell you where you left your socks.  She rolled up and down your fat brick.  But it was Lee who took her to the Meg Ryan flick.  She's got a face full of nuts and a mouth full of cots.  She's done see Larry King for no kids on the block.  She blew the Winnipeg Jets right after a game.  But they never got to know her actual name on your face.  She will piss on your chair. 
[03:41:30]  She might poop.  But she won't prepare her famous vegetable soup.  That's simply reasonable.  She'll bite you.  She'll spank you.  But she'll never thank you for free.  Cause baby.  Cause I'm going to leave.  Coming home. 
[03:42:00]  I've been gangbanging, killing, skinning, rob, motherfuckers.  Except it cracked, got my holes in the back.  I don't give a fuck about nobody in this motherfucker.  Let me show your ass up.  What the fuck I want to do, nigga?  What you want to do, nigga?  Huh?  It's nice to see that the office is really cool. 
[03:42:30]  Coming along, there are three more wires hanging down than there were last week.  Yeah, where's our office?  I don't know.  We've been doing this for two and a half weeks already.  Yeah, it was supposed to be done like the first week we were here.  We signed this contract a long time ago. 
[03:43:00]  This should have all been done, I'm thinking.  Yep.  At this point.  And the office itself?  I think at this point we should have been expanding.  Cause everyone knows eventually this is all going to be ours.  Of course it is.  Is that a ladder in our office though?  Like is someone actually doing something in there?  They're wiring something.  That could just be for something else though.  And finally after three hours, the last delicious bite of oatmeal.  Oh God, that must...  Dude, what did that last hunk taste like?  It's awful by the way.  Of course it's awful.  It's got to be Elmer's glue and tumors. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  I didn't expect us to talk for an hour and a half.  Yeah.  Well, you could have shoveled in a little piece and we would have covered the slack for the five seconds to chew a little oatmeal.  If you've got to get your energy up.  Gobble it down.  Yeah.  Gobble, gobble.  Throw a little oatmeal on the chin just for old time's sake.  Right to the tippy top.  Right to the tippy top.  Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.  Scrump diddly-ishous.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Pablo in the Bronx.  What's up, Pablo?  What's up, O&A?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, your show right now sucks because you got that guy Norton in there, man. 
[03:44:00]  What's the matter there?  What's the matter, Pablo?  Nothing.  It's just you.  You suck, man.  Nobody's calling in.  Nothing good.  You know?  It's like you guys are losing it, man.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, gee.  You don't really like me?  I'm sorry, Pablo.  What would you prefer me to do?  It's my O&A, not my Norton's O&A.  Maybe do something funny like they do on Spanish TV?  Put on, like, hide my mustache and put on a dress and pretend I'm a woman? 
[03:44:30]  Oh, gee.  All right, guys.  That was a good effort.  What are you talking about, man?  Norton barely talked today.  It goes in cycles.  You barely talked today.  You don't ever need to explain yourself or your motives to Pablo.  What happened then?  All right.  Pablo.  Pablo.  All right, let's try to make ourselves feel better.  We'll take this phone call because our ego's got a little hurt there.  A little bruised.  Floyd from Atlanta.  Yes.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[03:45:00]  Hey.  Hi, Floyd.  What's up, Lloyd?  We're giving away the secrets of radio.  When you feel bad about yourself, you go to a call that's going to tell you how great you are.  Oh, good.  So let's sit back and listen to Floyd.  Yes, Floyd?  I had my service for a year, and I just got you guys.  I missed the first week and a half.  Yeah.  I think you guys rock.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm sad to say I've never heard of you before.  Yep.  Yep.  I was a stern listener, and you've shown me the lot.  Oh, thanks, Floyd.  Thank you, Floyd.  And you wouldn't have heard of us if it was for XM's advertising. 
[03:45:30]  You just happened to stumble onto it.  You speak the truth.  Of course I do.  All right.  Thanks, Floyd.  We got a couple Frenchmen on the line.  Opie and Floyd were talking.  That's kind of odd, isn't it?  I know.  Floyd.  Where's A and B?  I get it.  Nah, Floyd.  I get it.  Opie and Aunt B.  I get it.  That's funny when the papers say that one.  Did they ever say that?  Oh, Aunt B's going to be mad.  Opie and Dopey.  Wow, that's really funny, too.  Shepard Smith said it, didn't he?  Did he?  Opie. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, no, no.  O'Reilly said it.  Oh, and I bet you Aunt B is not happy.  It was either Shepard Smith or O'Reilly.  Did O'Reilly say that?  Whatever.  Yeah.  All right.  We got Frenchie on the line, and we got another Frenchman that wants to take out Frenchie.  So we need rules here, because it really sucks when they start screaming at each  other.  Yeah, I can't hear anything.  Should we do it in debate fashion, and then maybe at the end have them go at it?  Frenchie debates?  One coward at a time.  One coward at a time.  Okay.  One coward at a time.  And then the grand finale, we'll let them go at it. 
[03:46:30]  Let them go at it together.  The whole going at it thing is good, but it's hard to, you know.  Should we have an opening statement so they could both assess one another?  Sure.  Why don't we do that?  All right.  We got to go to the challenger.  His name's really Ernie, but he's French, so he wants to pronounce Henri or something like  that.  His name is all scrambled here.  Henri.  Henri.  Yes.  I want my money, Henri!  All right.  Henri.  Henri.  Henri.  Henri.  Henri. 
[03:47:00]  Henri.  Are you ready for your opening statement to Frenchie as you try to take him out?  Yes.  Now, are you familiar with Frenchie?  I am.  I'm familiar with that.  Okay.  You've heard him?  Unfortunately, yes.  Okay.  And what do you think about him?  Go ahead.  He has no material anymore.  Every call is faggot this, faggot that, moron this.  He's got no material.  He never, you know, when you can reach him, he has nothing to say.  And he's just a little French faggot. 
[03:47:30]  That's it.  All right.  That's your opening statement?  Need I say more?  All right.  Very good.  Okay.  He kind of bashed Frenchie when he's down.  All right.  Frenchie has done a lot for the show, but his last couple appearances, very lacking.  Yeah.  Very lackluster.  We'll see if he can come back now and assess what Henri has said.  Frenchie?  Yes.  The real Frenchie.  Did you invite me to dinner with you and your girlfriend last night?  Yes, I did.  Why?  Because we're going to Pomodoro. 
[03:48:00]  Right, but why would you invite me?  Because you go eat over there every once in a while.  You want to kiss my ass, because you know your appearances on the show have been lackluster,  and you're trying to get in a little bit.  Not at all.  I will not back from that.  Why would you invite another guy out if you're hanging with your chick?  Well, because we're going to this place, man.  It's a good place.  I like to be there.  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.  Mwah, mwah.  Suck it.  He's like Pepe Le Pew.  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.  Okay, let me try. 
[03:48:30]  I will take you out to Denel.  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.  He didn't make you...  Pomodoro.  I was going to do that old gag, put the spaghetti in my crotch.  Ho, ho, ho.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, just like the German did.  All right, so Frenchie, someone is trying to take you out.  It's Henri on the other line, and he had his opening statement.  Were you able to hear it?  Yes, I was able to.  All right, and what do you have to say about that, Frenchie?  Well, you know what?  Who is he?  Who does he think he is? 
[03:49:00]  He's not French, first of all.  Why?  You don't think he's French?  No, I don't think so.  Oh, okay.  And why don't you think so?  Why not?  Because he doesn't sound French at all.  He's just trying to put a little accent of what he was saying.  Oh, he's calling him a fraud.  Oh.  A French fraud.  All right, quick.  French fraud, yeah.  A freedom fraud.  The yellow light has come on.  So give the rest of your opening statement.  And, okay, yeah, it's true.  I need to change my material.  But that's going to come up.  That's not really a problem.  Frenchie, you're supposed to kind of attack him now.  Yeah, not defend yourself like you're a fucking author explaining your last novel, stupid. 
[03:49:30]  But he's a nobody, and he can go and suck it, that fucking dick.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Now I'm goddamn pissed off now.  Oh, yeah, you sound really pissed off.  You really do sound yelled up.  I have enough.  Watch out for the old one-two.  It's coming.  I'm so angry, I could give my country over to a bunch of Nazis.  I'm so mad, I could put a daisy in your hair and polish your shoe.  You know what that means. 
[03:50:00]  All right.  There goes Frenchie.  Another guy, Richard, wants in really fast from Texas.  Richard, yes?  Yeah.  All right.  What's going on?  Well, personally, I think these two assholes who think they're French should speak a little  French, like with a taken guy in the Margin Marbe.  So, what do you think about that?  Are you French?  Yes, I am.  I'm from Montreal, Quebec.  Oh, French-Canadian.  Yeah.  Well, a French cowboy, though.  He's in Texas.  Well, I'm a trucker, so. 
[03:50:30]  Oh, a French trucker.  Yeah.  All right.  He's chucking croissants around the country.  All right.  Let's go back to Henri.  Another load of French bread coming in.  Oh, here he comes.  All right, Henri.  That was the warm-up.  We've got to hear your A material.  You've got to get mad.  This is it.  Right here.  Let's go after Frenchie.  That was a waste.  He comes on the phone telling me that I'm not French, and he calls me a nobody.  He comes on the air to invite you to dinner, and I guarantee his girlfriend would not even 
[03:51:00]  be there.  It would be in an alley to try to suck your dick, Opie, because he is trying to kiss your  ass.  That's very obvious.  Okay?  Yeah.  So, I don't understand how he can come on the air and say that about me.  And meanwhile, I can guarantee that his grandfather died with Hitler's dick in his mouth.  I can guarantee you that.  Wow.  All right.  Funny and sexy.  He's gotten a kind of...  And I knew that Norton would like that.  I did, buddy. 
[03:51:30]  How are we going to get the winner?  First one surrenders?  Wow.  His grandfather died with Hitler's dick in his mouth.  All right.  All right.  Let's see if Frenchie has a response.  That's going to hurt.  Before we put them both on the line for the grand finale.  I like it.  Violent, a little creative, some history in there.  And you can picture that mustache and the hand on the French head.  Frenchie, what do you have to say about that?  His Hitler pube swept over one side.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  His new book, Mind Coward.  All right.  Sorry, Frenchie.  Sorry.  Go ahead. 
[03:52:00]  No, I messed up.  I should have been paying attention.  All right.  Go ahead, Frenchie.  Okay.  Well, Henry, first of all, his father died with his dick inside the queen's pussy because  you know what?  What?  He's a fucking fraud.  He's not French.  I'm telling you.  He's a fucking asshole.  But it's radio.  Who cares if they're really French as long as we can have the illusion.  There are people that try to make believe that they're French when they're not.  That's fucking fine.  I think he is French.  I do, too.  I don't think so.  But make him speak some words of French. 
[03:52:30]  I want to hear a whole fucking sentence.  Frenchie, you're kind of biting off of his, your grandfather, you know.  Yeah.  What do you have to say about that?  And if he died in the queen's pussy, that's not a bad place to go.  No, that's not bad.  Especially, you know, back then, the queen was still kind of...  Better than blowing Adolf while he eats poisoned chocolate.  Yeah, you're, you know.  But Frenchie, come on.  Let's go.  This is it.  Do or die.  Well, I'm not going to surrender yet, but I still call him a father and he's his ass 
[03:53:00]  wife.  That's what he is.  All right.  Let him speak French.  I want to hear it.  I don't know much French, you faggot.  You tell me like you know me.  You don't know me.  You sound Italian, you fucking greaseball.  And you want to bring Opie to dinner.  You fucking pussy ass.  Shut up.  Listen to this.  You listen to this.  At least put a better accent at it, you moron.  There is no accent.  This is the one I was born with.  Yeah, but you sound really fucked up with it, man.  Talk like you know me.  They probably peddled you when you were in school, speaking like a little faggot that you are. 
[03:53:30]  You have two years better than you are in the school you have.  Huh?  Little faggot.  Go back into your hole and die.  And this is all you have.  Yes, I have more than you do, you prick.  How does Opie's balls taste?  Tell me that.  They taste like your fucking ass, you faggot.  Yeah, they taste like Anthony's balls.  Your breath smells like a dick.  Yeah, but you look like a fucking dick.  Tell me you have a girlfriend, please.  What is his name, huh?  It's your sister, you fuck.  Please, my sister. 
[03:54:00]  Please.  Did you see that I was penning on the ass all night, telling her, who's your daddy, you whore?  Guys, this is Julie.  How's that, huh?  We know who won this one, so please.  Yeah, sure.  I am the new French.  It's quite obvious.  Right, no, but just tell me one sentence.  I come on the air and call me faggot.  Come on, come on, you fussy.  You fussy.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Give me a one in French.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Closing statements will go with Henri first.  Henri?  I think everything I said speaks for itself, no? 
[03:54:30]  Oh.  I mean, this guy has no material.  I come on the air and put him down every which way.  He has nothing to say.  Every other word is faggot, moron.  It's the same shit.  Two years to come up with new material and he has nothing.  So, I mean, please.  This is no contest.  All right.  And Frenchy to you.  Well, that's not a contest, first of all.  And you are fraud, so you have nothing to say.  You couldn't fall back into your hole.  Shut up when I'm talking, you faggot. 
[03:55:00]  Freak.  You fuck.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Yeah, you see, I got you, huh, you little whore.  Oh, Frenchy making a little comeback.  I'm trying to do this faggot time to speak and he doesn't accept.  Okay.  Well, I'm going to make you my little bitch sooner or later.  Don't worry about it.  I don't even know who's winning this one.  Go ahead.  All right.  Yeah, but I won already.  It doesn't really matter, you goddamn cocksucker.  There's nothing else to say except stupid words.  Please, continue.  But I like that.  Don't you think so?  Well, I want to still hear a little word of French from you, you little fud. 
[03:55:30]  I'm on the air, please.  You on the air?  What?  You sound like the fucking guy from Stalag 13.  Gross fucker.  You sound like that French faggot on the Stalag 13.  So, when you kiss your girlfriend, you'll taste my dick.  No, my girlfriend actually blows me.  That's good enough.  Don't you worry.  I don't need your help.  I don't need your help from the city while you suck Obie's balls.  That's a good one.  You son of a bitch.  One good line was when the guy, when Henri said, what does Obie's balls taste like in French,  he said, your ass, you faggot. 
[03:56:00]  I thought it was a good line.  That was a good one.  All right.  Well, I do want to hear Henri speak French, though.  I don't know if Henri speaks French.  Yes, I really kind of do.  I don't know.  I don't know much French.  Growing up in France, I went to a school that spoke mainly American.  My ass.  I don't know much French at all.  My ass.  Okay.  Okay, well, how about a little something in French?  What?  No, no, I'm asking Henri.  I barely know any French at all.  Henri, I cannot believe you grow up in France enough where you have an accent and you don't  speak any French. 
[03:56:30]  I speak barely any French.  How about a little bit?  Go ahead.  Say something, you faggot.  Come on, let's go.  Something.  You do this faggot.  There's nothing else to say.  Okay, how about this one?  It's best.  Don't kill it.  I'm going to kill you.  All right.  Henri's on hold.  I've got to go to Fritz in Dallas.  We only have like a minute left in the show.  We didn't play What Did We Learn Today?  That's okay.  Let's say hi to Fritz in Dallas.  Go ahead, Fritz.  What do you got?  How are you guys doing today?  Good.  I can't believe these French guys.  They really piss me off.  I am so glad that my country invaded them in 1941. 
[03:57:00]  You know why they planted all the trees along the road there in France, don't you?  Why?  Soldiers could march in the shade.  And you know why they closed the Euro Disney in France, don't you?  No.  Because every time they had fireworks, all the people in the park jumped on the fucking ground.  You moron.  Those are these guys.  I can't believe it.  You know, where I was living is like 20 miles from the border of France. 
[03:57:30]  And we used to go in and beat up French guys just for the hell of it sometimes, you know?  And you know what?  Hey, listen, buddy.  You know what the French...  It was so easy to do, you know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, listen to what I have to say.  You know what the French...  You know, they knew what they were doing when they sold Louisiana to America, you fucking cocksucker.  You know, you know, in Germany...  A Louisiana purchase joke?  Wow.  They used to have some good music that comes from Germany. 
[03:58:00]  What rock bands do you have come from France?  And no need for...  Hello.  Stand call, please.  This is Mike Matthews, a collection.  Mm-hmm.  I'm calling in regards to your delinquent account with Dr. Tomar DeMort.  Yeah?  It has been turned into our collection agency for, uh, the amount of $43.  You gotta be kidding me.  No, sir, I'm not.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  Let me tell you something.  That doctor had me come in about six months ago for a full physical.  Put me there in his little examination room. 
[03:58:30]  Told me to get naked.  I'm sitting there by that naked.  About 20 minutes.  Finally, he comes in and he says, put this gown on.  I tell you, the gown had lace on it.  And he told me, finally, he said, I want to shut my property down.  I told me to bend over.  So I'm thinking, hey, he's a doctor.  He's going there.  I'm bending over and stuff.  Checking my property.  Turn around.  The guy had both hands on my shoulders.  I don't think it's damn bit funny right now.  He's in there laughing.  My experience I've gone through.  Sir?  Yeah?  Your medical history is irrelevant, sir. 
[03:59:00]  I'm telling you, he's not getting no money from me.  I went there to get a physical.  Told me to put a 90 on.  I put the thing on.  He took my property down.  Had both hands on my shoulders and everything.  I can't even look at my wife the same way.  Come out, Bob's cutting the grass next door.  And I get kind of sexually aroused.  And I don't even know which way I'm coming or going.  Do you understand?  Have you talked to them over there?  Have you talked to them?  Yes, I have, sir.  I've talked to their...  Did he ask about me?  No, the doctor's not even involved.  I'm talking to their accounting department. 
[03:59:30]  I mean, he's still jogging and working out the weights and everything.  I have no idea, sir.  He's getting kind of buffed there for a while.  I think he's got up a little bit like Brad Pitt.  Sir, is your good credit history worth $43?  And a lot of virginity for $43?  Don't worry about that damn $43.  Maybe I'll call him up.  If he didn't hear you calling me right now, he'd probably be pissed.  He don't know that you're...  I'm sure the hell he don't know what this is all about.  Sir, your account is going to turn over to us.  It leaves our hands and goes into the lawyer's hands.  That's about your point.  Tell you what, you're about as much pain in the ass as he was. 
[04:00:00]  I'm going to go.  You can screw you, buddy.  Heather.  Goodbye, NHL.  Hello, video game.  I'm Ed Donahue with a home entertainment update.  It looks like the National Hockey League is literally on ice for the season.  Players are locked out.  For an alternative, there is the ESPN NHL 2K5 video game.  Producer Ben Bishop says new features include full stick control.  Basically, as you're skating backwards on defense, with the right analog stick,  you have the ability to sweep your stick freely in any direction.  Really block the passing range more effectively than you could before. 
[04:00:30]  This is a hockey video game, so there must be some fights.  We completely retooled our fighting engine,  and so if things are getting a little too intense out there on the ice  and your players end up dropping the gloves,  there's a whole new fighting industry to play around with  and have some fun, you know, getting out some of your aggression.  And you can play NHL 2K5 online.  What's really great is now you can actually play through full seasons  and you can even create tournaments.  So, you know, even up to 30 people,  if you can have one person controlling each team,  you can go through the season, you can make trades.  ESPN NHL 2K5 is rated E for everyone. 
[04:01:00]  I'm Ed Donahue.  It's everything 24-7.  XM-202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything all the time. 
[04:01:30]  It's everything all the time.  It's everything all the time.  It's everything all the time.  It's everything all the time.  It's everything all the time.  It's everything all the time.
