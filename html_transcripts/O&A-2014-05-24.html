<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of Michael Jackson's posthumous financial success and new album release, briefly touching upon cyber espionage charges against Chinese officials before pivoting to horse racing and a caller, Mike from Rockland, sharing humorous anecdotes about his work as a farrier, including details about stallion bodily fluids.  The segment then became a mystery as the hosts grappled with a surprise guest booking, suspecting a prank by someone known as "Fake Roland," prompting a break to investigate.

After the break, the hosts vehemently criticized the 9/11 Museum gift shop, finding the sale of 9/11-themed merchandise (mugs, hats, scarves, etc.) deeply inappropriate, contrasting it with the approach of other historical sites like Gettysburg and the Holocaust Museum.  A caller, Frank from the Bronx, echoed their disgust, emphasizing the shop's proximity to the victims' remains.  The hosts then debated the museum's potential for profit.  This transitioned into a discussion of Vince McMahon's significant financial loss ($357 million) due to a disappointing WWE television deal, and speculation on who might be gleeful about his misfortune (Eric Bischoff, Ted Turner, Bret Hart, Bob Costas, and CM Punk were mentioned). The segment concluded with reminiscences about a former employee, "Spaz," his eccentric predictions, and humorous anecdotes from his time on the show, including a tampon-related incident.  The Rock's past appearance was also briefly mentioned.

The following segment heavily focused on the WWE's declining stock price and Mick Foley's decision not to renew his merchandising deal due to low video game royalty payments.  The hosts and callers engaged in highly offensive and tasteless jokes about wrestlers' pay, including offensive comments about deceased wrestler Owen Hart, utilizing numerous wrestling puns and stock market metaphors.  A large part of the discussion centered on Mark Cuban and Kevin O'Leary's poorly-received comedic bit at the Billboard Music Awards, with the hosts and callers harshly criticizing O'Leary using offensive language.  Paul Orndorff's atrophied arm was attributed to steroid use, and the hosts discussed "Shark Tank," criticizing Barbara Corcoran.  A news story about a giant mosquito in Queens spreading encephalitis provided further opportunity for vulgar humor.  The segment concluded with comedian Pat Oswald entering the studio.  A discussion ensued about Oswalt's recent apology tweets, the complexities of online discourse, political correctness, and the overreactions of some social justice advocates. They also touched upon instances of people apologizing on behalf of others, even when the offended party wasn't upset.  A short, offensively funny clip from the 1970s show "Fernwood Tonight" was played.


A subsequent segment featured a comedic bit with a guest, "Dr. Kaczynski," presenting absurd and offensive "studies" filled with racist jokes and stereotypes about various ethnic groups (Italians, Jewish people, Irish people, Chinese people, and Japanese people).  The segment transitioned to a discussion about the Webby Awards, hosted by Patton Oswalt (who was in the studio). Oswalt discussed nominated online videos, including a pro-gay marriage video and Vines by King Bach.  He shared anecdotes about his early comedy career, a job he disliked, and humorous experiences at a law firm.  He promoted his upcoming Webby Awards hosting gig and other appearances.  Opie and Anthony interjected with jokes, often escalating the offensive or absurd tone.  Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy were briefly mentioned, and several advertisements aired.


A later segment featured Patton Oswalt again, discussing his upcoming show at the Gisu Theater, upcoming vacations, and the Billboard Music Awards.  A significant portion focused on the Michael Jackson hologram at the awards, its realism (or lack thereof), and comparisons to previous celebrity holograms, particularly Tupac's.  The conversation included tangents such as a caller's sexual experiences while watching *Ratatouille*,  the use of the N-word,  crude and sexually explicit jokes and anecdotes, and personal anecdotes from the hosts and guests. DJ Who Kid briefly appeared. The post-show with Sam Roberts continued the discussions, heavily featuring Oswalt's appearance and the Michael Jackson hologram, interspersed with numerous advertisements.


The final segment centered on comedian Joey Diaz. The hosts expressed effusive praise for Diaz, using strong profane language, and recounted a story about Diaz's uninvited sexual encounter with a woman.  Other comedians were discussed, including Bert Kreischer (with whom they expressed a "wicked man crush"), Anthony Bourdain (whose wife's jujitsu was mentioned), and Louis C.K.  Diaz's past unreliability and recent improvement were noted.  Other topics included the Travel Channel's ownership and censorship concerns; a new Louis C.K. stand-up special; one host's blood rejuvenation treatment; a physical altercation at a comedy club; a comedic boxing match; one host's hernia surgeries; their actions on 9/11; their opinions on superhero movies; and a discussion of Bitcoin.  The segment ended with advertisements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And family? Have you heard any?  Oh, good question.  They were really supportive of it.  What's that to you, Bonnie? What's that to you?  They were really supportive of it, thinking they could make another fortune.  The estate is fully behind this.  I mean, why wouldn't Michael Jackson's family love it?  They would only be supportive if they knew there was money in it for that.  He's gained $600 million since he passed away.  So, I was going to say, there's another song from his album,  Love Never Felt So Good with JT.  He's worth more debt, you know that?  There's funds being generated.  People are still enjoying his music.  It's as though he's here, except not.  Kate makes a good point, though.  It's going to be how much is too much. 
[00:00:30]  Like, if they say there's going to be a new tour with MJ to push his new album.  I hear you.  MJ.  Yeah, that would be very interesting.  But he does have a new album out this week, Escape.  And it's number one on the charts.  Michael Jackson's hologram hit an unspecified settlement for molesting a child's hologram.  Bonnie Fuller, HollywoodLife.com.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Thanks, Bonnie.  Thank you.  Thanks, Bonnie Fuller.  We do have some breaking news for you.  The U.S. is charging Chinese officials with cyber espionage.  Have me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  There's no breaking news anymore.  Shut up.  No. 
[00:01:00]  So what are some of the names from these stupid animals?  Oh, yeah.  Dumb stupid animals.  Broomspun.  Yeah.  Majestic Prince.  Oh, that sounds like a winner.  Bimelech.  How has that not been used yet?  Majestic Prince.  Right.  Well, that was back in when?  69.  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  War Cloud.  I don't remember War Cloud.  19, what?  18, I believe that.  18, I believe that.  18, I get that.  Duke of Magenta. 
[00:01:30]  You are the Duke of Magenta.  Native Dancer.  Hmm.  Damn Rush.  These names are whatever.  Nah, they're not that bad.  Forget it.  These are the winners, though.  Okay.  Let's say hi to Mike in Rockland.  Mike.  Mike.  What's going on, fellas?  I was a farrier, so what we do is work on horses.  Can you whisper?  It sounds cooler if you guys whisper the horse shit.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't hear you.  All right.  I didn't hear you.  That does, man.  Go ahead.  So we work on horses, and you don't need the horse taking their shoes off and put their 
[00:02:00]  shoes on, and the stallions would just be leaking cum all over the place.  Your shoes on your pants.  Here comes the pre.  On your hands.  Oh, you just get cum all over you?  You just try to change their shoes and they're cumming?  Or my buddy would be under the horse and he'd get all over his arm and he'd just come  up behind me and wipe it on the side of my face.  A farrier.  Are these horses aware that they're running these big races?  Or are they just animals in the end?  They don't give a fuck.  I feel bad for them, man. 
[00:02:30]  I think they could run them to the ground, so I don't know.  I gotta go.  I'm trying not to die.  Oh, what are you fucking...  All right.  Showing a horse?  No, no.  There he goes.  What happened?  Nothing.  What happened?  What are you whispering about?  I don't like it.  I'm just trying to figure out a situation with a guest.  What guest?  Exactly.  We have a surprise guest?  I'm looking at the sheet.  Oh, no.  Apparently.  All right.  Who's here?  Well, I mean, it's not bad.  It's not a bad guest.  We'll be happy. 
[00:03:00]  We don't want any guests.  Write it down.  All right.  I think you'll be fine.  Another fake booking?  No.  None of us know who booked it.  What?  Oh, yeah.  That's fine.  Yeah, of course.  We're just all trying to figure out how it happened.  Fake Roland?  That would be too funny.  Did fake Roland do it again?  I blocked that cunt.  You did?  Yeah.  Yeah, I just blocked him, too.  Enough.  I blocked him, too.  Enough.  I'm blocking everybody. 
[00:03:30]  Like I said, Twitter's just a shitty place.  I don't have time for any of that crap anymore.  So when is he coming in?  Soon?  Uh, according to his Twitter, in about an hour.  Nice.  Yeah.  I mean, it's good news.  We're just trying to...  I was just...  We were talking to Travis and texting Roland and stuff, trying to figure out if somebody  had done it without saying it.  I think we all saw something at the same time.  Yeah, and so we were just trying to figure out how.  It's got to be fake.  You think it's fake Roland? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Roland would have said something.  I mean, it's good news.  Yeah.  Why don't we...  One of the...  We'd actually be happy that he's here.  I'm sure.  We probably should take a break to try to figure it out, I'm thinking.  All righty.  What?  Yeah, we're going to take a break to try to figure it out.  We should try to figure it out.  We're just going to try to figure it all out.  I could just leave the room.  No, we should break and figure it out, I think.  Let's do that.  Yeah, we should do that.  I mean, you need a...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I was...  I mean, you guys are just going to sit here.  I'm going to go and figure it out anyway.  And we'll talk about Vince when we get back.

[00:13:30]  Nice.  Ooh.  You're alive.  You and I will walk without a ride.  There's no sign of the morning coming.  You've been left on your own.  Like a rainbow star.  What?  Just a rainbow in the dark.  Fucking love this song.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, yeah.  Now we're talking.  Du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du.  Just a rainbow in the dark.  9-11 Museum has a gift shop.  No surprise there.  No.  That's not a surprise.  No.  It's something we brought up on the show.  I don't know, at least 15 years ago  at this point, where enough time  goes by and it just becomes  whatever. No offense to 
[00:14:30]  people that were directly affected by 9-11,  but all you have to do is look at the whole  Titanic thing and now it's a ride  that you could rent for your  kids' party  and put it up in the backyard.  We actually had one of those Titanic things  at our celebrity softball  game, remember? Yes!  We put it in right field  or something, I believe, and it was just out there.  Yeah, and now  they've got the 9-11 museum and of course  they've got a gift shop, which is really  strange. And what could you get at the gift shop? 
[00:15:00]  What kind of stuff?  You can get a FDNY rescue  dog vest.  Something for your little doggy.  Like the ones that probably went in there to look  at all the bodies. Okay, got it.  Good, good. For $25, you can get  a 10th anniversary flag of honor.  A 10th anniversary flag of honor.  It's just a flag, but it's got to be a flag of honor  because we're selling it basically in a mass grave.  So when you're selling a flag  in a mass grave, it has to say  flag of honor.  It's true.  To be dignified.  Right.  These are rocks. 
[00:15:30]  These are heart-shaped stones  with messages of hope on them  for $39.  What's good? A $39 rock?  Like the rubble?  Yeah, what kind of messages  of hope on there?  No day shall phase you  from the memory of time.  That's right.  We remember because we're selling this  on a mass grave.  Wow.  United in hope.  Who's behind the museum?  It's not the government?  No, it's a private...  I think it's been privatized.  Right.  And the excuse they're using is,  well, the money goes to sustain 
[00:16:00]  the museum and the victims' families.  I don't give a fuck  where the money goes.  The money to the victims' families  should...  This is one of those things  where the government should foot the bill  because it was an attack on the U.S.  Right.  So I don't mind my taxes  going up a little bit  if I know it's being used  to fund the college tuitions  of the children of 9-11 victims.  Sure.  Or to sustain this museum,  which should be sustained  by the government.  How about you give  one billion less  to some...  A 9-11 coffee cup?  Yeah, just something  you can remember every morning 
[00:16:30]  with the 9-11 memorial coffee mug.  Yeah.  How about giving  a billion dollars less  to some country  that fucking is disgusting  or some shitty rebels  that are going to turn on us anyway  and you use it  to fund something like this?  Yeah.  I have no problem.  There are people  definitely profiting on this.  9-11 coffee mug.  That's good.  Don't get caught  in the next dust storm  without a 9-11 memorial cap.  Oh, good.  You want that.  It's only $19.95  for a limited time.  Cool.  Great.  Mass grave hat.  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:17:00]  And of course the T-shirt.  The T-shirt.  Wait, wait.  Where's the jumper?  Remember the falling man?  Oh, there you go.  Where's the falling man poster?  Oh, boy.  I would love to...  How about a falling man poster?  Well, that wouldn't be very nice, would it?  Well, how about a falling man,  like a cup with a falling man on it  and as you turn it,  his falling progress...  Oh, that would be interesting.  Sure.  Remember those pens  that you could turn upside down  and the clothes would come off?  What if the man falls off the building  when you turn the pen up?  Oh, that's great.  Probably be a big seller down there.  But if you turn it upside down, 
[00:17:30]  he goes back up to the top of the building  and you're like,  oh, that worked out nicely.  Start over again.  There you go.  Well, you can get the two towers on a hoodie.  Jesus.  Wow.  That's disgusting.  There is...  We used to attack,  verbally bash those guys outside  that sold pictures of the burning buildings.  Right.  These people are just as...  I don't care where the money goes.  The government should be taking care of that.  For $95,  you can have a silk scarf  with the towers on it.  Oh, it's delightful.  Yes, a silk scarf.  On fire or before they were attacked?  It was right before they were attacked. 
[00:18:00]  So they're not on fire yet.  Thank God.  Photo taken on 910.  Yes.  That's great.  Good, good, good.  Perfect.  Cool.  Wow.  Cool.  So you're not for this gift shop, Jim?  It makes me fucking sick to my stomach  because I hate when the government  takes over and does shit  and I think privatizing things is good.  But in this case,  when the country is attacked,  this is in disgusting taste.  Remember right after 9-11,  a lot of those sidewalk vendors  were selling photographs 
[00:18:30]  of the World Trade Center on fire  and all that shit  and then they were getting  the shit beat out of them?  I just said that.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  I was trying to get my pal Tog working on it.  Oh, really?  Understandable.  Oh, see?  Oh.  Yeah, they got the shit beat out of them.  Yeah.  For $15,  all the kids can get  an FDNY toy vehicle set.  Great.  Little matchbox fire trucks.  In good shape or crushed?  Yeah.  They smashed.  Let me look at these.  Oh, no, no, no.  These are on their way to the towers  so they're not all crushed yet. 
[00:19:00]  Cool.  So the ones you're selling  in the mass grave for the kids  are not going to be crushed.  Got it.  Not yet.  Not yet.  A couple people who got really mad on Twitter  and the ones who were like,  cool.  They're getting mad at your opinion on this?  Well, a couple of them were like,  yeah, but is this different than Gettysburg?  They asked questions,  so I kind of went back and forth with them.  But the ones who were angry,  like, I don't know your fucking...  Blocked.  Cunt.  I don't care who you are  or how you're related to this.  Go fuck yourself.  What was the argument?  There's no surprise here.  Enough time goes by.  This shit happens.  It's going to the...  What are we up to now? 
[00:19:30]  Like 12 years, right?  13 years or something?  What was the argument with Gettysburg?  Coming up on 13, yeah.  How come it's okay at Gettysburg?  And, like, I understood the point of that.  Yeah.  And my point was simply, like,  I get the inconsistency in the thinking,  but it is different,  and you know it's different.  Ah.  You can't pretend that Gettysburg  carries the same emotional weight  right now that this does.  And maybe in a court of law,  you would win,  but you know the difference.  I think when people are still alive  that were directly affected with the event,  maybe when a generation passes, 
[00:20:00]  then maybe.  I don't know.  You're right.  It's just too close.  Pearl Harbor memorabilia.  I'm sure that on the Arizona Memorial,  there are Arizona,  USS Arizona souvenirs.  Maybe there's something about the fact  that it was a military action,  military actions.  There's something about that,  a little different than civilians  being massacred.  But then people raise the Holocaust,  and there's a Holocaust museum,  and an Unfrank museum,  and maybe they have a gift shop, too.  It's one of those too-soons. 
[00:20:30]  It just feels like it's too soon.  It just really bothers me,  because I think it's just...  You know all this goes in this direction eventually,  but this one seems a little too soon, right?  And get United We Stand blanket.  It's just that same fucking fake,  feel-good, bullshit patriotism  that doesn't last.  You know, Freedom,  the Freedom Tower.  Oh, fuck you.  One World Trade.  That's all I call it.  I will never call it the Freedom Tower. 
[00:21:00]  It's a terrible...  Freedom way.  ...forced fake name.  It's so hack.  It really is.  It really bugs me.  We're a bunch of hacks in the end.  Maybe the admission I understand.  The Freedom Tower.  Because we're so free in America.  We're so free.  Okay.  Are we?  Please.  Are we really that free in America?  Go down to the Freedom Tower.  Oh, it's not free.  That's right.  Right.  Maybe the admission makes sense,  even though I don't like it,  but all right,  they keep a certain amount of people in at a time  and keeps it organized, but... 
[00:21:30]  Isn't the Museum of Natural History  just a suggested donation?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  But they have it set up in such a way  you feel incredibly guilty  if you don't pay.  If you don't pay.  But you don't have to pay.  Because they give you...  They roll their eyes.  Because I've gone there so many times  after a while.  I'm like,  I don't feel like fucking giving the suggested anymore.  I've been in this damn place a million times  with my kid and stuff.  So I'm like anyone else.  I'll skin Flynn a little bit.  And they roll their eyes.  And I once said to a lady like,  Oh, really?  I bet if you were on this side of the counter, 
[00:22:00]  you would try to like,  you know,  pay the least amount possible.  What?  Because you have the authority for the next hour?  You're going to roll your eyes?  But when you're a civilian,  you're going to do the exact same shit  we're trying to do here.  What's the suggested entry  for a Museum of Natural History?  It's up there.  It's like 20-something bucks or something.  Look at dinosaurs.  It's free.  Yeah.  But if they have it,  it says admission.  I don't know exactly.  But it says something like admission  in a big letter  with the $23,  whatever it is.  But right above that, 
[00:22:30]  it says suggested  in the tiniest font possible.  I'm going to suggest a nickel.  It's $22.  $22 less than the 9-11 museum.  Right.  What are you going to do?  You know,  they've got to fucking  strip those bones down somehow.  No, I've paid...  The money goes to the Mastodon's family.  Dude, I've paid the suggested,  but when you go a lot,  you start going,  really,  I'm going to just throw another 150,  you know,  because you bring people and stuff.  And of course,  because you're the one  that fucking makes the money. 
[00:23:00]  You've got to pay for everybody.  It's got to, you know...  I understand they have to...  There has to be some maintenance there.  Like, where's that money coming from  with the Museum of Natural History?  No, but they guilt you into it,  is my point.  They look at you like,  you're a scumbag.  I don't mind them charging.  You really want to only pay $5  when it's worth suggesting $22.  I don't mind the History Museum charging.  There's something about...  I used to go to these buildings  when they were there for free.  They're not charging.  Hold on.  Hold on.  They're not charging.  You could technically go into the museum 
[00:23:30]  and not pay...  Yeah.  You could say,  I have decided  I'm going in for free today  and there's nothing they can do about it.  Yeah.  But then they get you  with the special exhibits.  The reason why you go to the museum.  Like, oh,  they got a special exhibit  on NASA or whatever.  Those you have to pay  to go and see.  But I'm saying,  no, it wouldn't even bother me  if they charged for those.  Because, you know,  that's a museum.  It's nice.  But this is fucking...  They were free to go to  when they were standing.  They get knocked down.  Bureaucracy keeps them  13 years later. 
[00:24:00]  Still not completely built.  And we have to pay.  There's just something  annoying about that.  It's not the money.  It's just the idea of it.  This guy was at the memorial.  All right.  Hold on.  Frank from the Bronx.  I think he's a regular, too.  Hey, Frank.  What's up, boys?  How you doing?  Hi, Frank.  All right, man.  What do you got on this?  All right.  So they're comparing it  to the other museum  of natural history.  How can they compare it?  First off,  I was at the damn thing.  And the gift shop  is the most tackiest.  They're silk scarves 
[00:24:30]  for $49.99.  I mean,  it's the most ridiculous thing  in the world.  And right next to you  is where they have  the leftover unknown body parts  basically probably 100 yards  to your right  from the gift shop.  You tell me.  Somebody tell me  what the hell,  what the fuck  is going on right there.  They're pigs.  When we were watching jumpers  and there was a body  hitting the ground,  did you ever think  that 13 years later  where that body splashed, 
[00:25:00]  right under there,  you'll be able to buy  a silk scarf  with a tower on each one.  Yeah.  Remember.  Oh, it's fucking shit.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  It's shit.  And then the one thing  that I, you know,  I, the Statue of Liberty,  what, why would they have  little statuettes  of the Statue of Liberty  in a 9-11 museum?  I don't understand it.  If that's not,  let's order a whole bunch  of shit from China  and let's pack it up 
[00:25:30]  because we can't  take more money on it.  It probably is made in fucking,  made in Saudi Arabia.  It's gross.  Oh, it's just ridiculous.  It's just ridiculous.  But, I mean, Jimmy,  I love your passion about it.  I can't agree with you more.  Thank you.  I mean, I'd like to get,  I'd get that jumper pen  that you turn upside down  and then at the bottom of it  you see him hitting the floor.  That sounds like a good,  I'd pay $100 for that.  But that's not that outrageous.  It's not as too far-fetched  considering what they are  selling down there.  They might as well go all in  and give you a little, like,  thing of the remains. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, that'd be, uh...  Some of the rubble,  you know what I mean?  Like when they knocked down  the wall over there  in Berlin.  Right.  They were selling pieces  of the wall.  They might as well sell  pieces of the rubble.  Like when Yankee Stadium...  Rubble, excuse me.  And everybody got some dirt.  Right.  The sand at Yankee Stadium,  the DNA from the trade center.  That's what we're going to tell.  Well, how about this?  $99.99.  No paper.  You got foreigners  taking pictures in front of it  like it's a happy time.  I think Brandon Steiner's  got a new business.  Yeah, there you go. 
[00:26:30]  He's probably got a dump truck  and he's just trying to get  as much of the rubble as possible.  Yeah, victim hair.  We have victim hair and dirt  behind a piece of nice glass  for you to take home.  But it has an inspirational message on it.  Right, right.  So it's okay.  Gary J, their rookie card.  Right.  If they did it like  you have to order something online,  why not do it online?  Make people order this shit online.  Because there's something about them  hawking it or hawking it,  whatever the word is,  right there  that is so fucking disgusting. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's disgusting.  It is.  If you call now,  we'll double your order.  All you have to do  is pay extra shipping and handling.  Absolutely.  Get actual audio screams captured  on cassette tape  for your cell phone.  Take a look at the airplane,  the second airplane.  Look at the view that we have here.  It's beautiful.  Yeah, we got you.  It approaches the building.  I think we got it.  Thanks.  All right, guys.  Sorry.  No worries.  I'll throw in a Derek Cedar rookie card.  All right, Frank.  There he goes. 
[00:27:30]  He's trying to get that.  Thank you, buddy.  Franky.  That's a tough one.  He's trying to get that going.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's disgusting.  Even if the money goes to the victims,  I'm not saying they're profiting off it.  Like, somebody's making a few bucks off that.  Somebody.  That shit always trickles down to somebody.  An administrator has to get paid.  Somebody is making actual money off that.  I guarantee it.  I guarantee it.  Is anybody disagreeing on Twitter?  They were disagreeing.  So does anybody have a point,  like, reason they're disagreeing?  Disagreeing?  They disagree on Twitter 
[00:28:00]  because Twitter is a shitty place.  Just because they can.  Because it's a shitty place.  This is reality right here.  We don't have one guy disagreeing.  The disagreement would be the inconsistency thing  with, like you said, Gettysburg  and, you know, the Titanic, things like that.  But you weren't even talking about those other gift shops.  They brought it up.  Right.  But I understand the comparison to Gettysburg  where people died there.  Yeah, if anyone wants to argue the point  and they bring up that point, 
[00:28:30]  it's kind of, it's a legitimate argument.  It just seems to feel a little better  if a lot of time has gone by.  Right.  For whatever reason.  For whatever reason.  I don't really, you know.  You're right.  Well, it's the same reason.  I can't really explain it fully, but.  It's the same reason, you know,  on TV they'll show bodies from World War II  in the most horrifically mangled fashion  because of, you know, World War II.  But they won't show something from now.  You know, they'll show some things,  but never to the magnitude  that they show bodies of World War II victims. 
[00:29:00]  Maybe because you feel like, well.  Enough time.  It's black and white.  Enough time went by.  Enough time went by.  If he wasn't killed in World War II,  he would have lived his life by now.  I don't know.  I don't know what it is that happens in your brain.  It's just something.  You're detached from that moment more so  than you are from 9-11.  So, yes, Trav?  The Holocaust Museum has a gift shop.  It does.  Yeah, in D.C.  See, that's an...  That's another one that feels kind of weird.  It didn't happen in D.C. 
[00:29:30]  That's one thing.  And, again, enough time went by,  and I don't think...  I don't think...  But is there a Holocaust Museum at Auschwitz,  which I do want to go to?  There are...  Maybe there is.  You can go there and see.  I don't know if there's a gift shop or anything.  Laszlo said he went,  and it was real creepy.  Yeah, I do want to see that, though.  It's really...  Like, he thought, like,  oh, cool, you know,  I'm going to go there,  I'm going to see part of history,  it's kind of cool.  Right.  And then he got there and thought, like,  oh, my God,  this is the most depressing place I've ever been.  Right, I remember. 
[00:30:00]  So there's just a vibe about the place  that is just pure, depressing evil.  I think there's a bookshop.  A bookshop.  Bookshop's not as bad...  That's not bad.  ...as a fucking...  ...as a dumb hat.  Scarps.  9-11 memorial hat.  Ashley, get me my scarf.  Who would wear a scarf with a tower  is one to your right,  one to your left?  Really?  It's fucking sickening.  Let's go to Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  Hey there, Paul.  He might have info on people making money off this.  Go ahead, Paul.  Before I get to that, 
[00:30:30]  I've been to Dachau,  and like you just said,  there is a bookshop there.  A bookshop.  I don't remember anything really stupid  being sold there.  That's legit, though.  And that sounds like an electric train set  or anything, right?  Right.  That would be very tasteless.  Easy-bake ovens or something.  Things like that, right.  Very tasteless.  Not good.  Two things.  I read over the weekend  where the head muckety-muck of the commission  is making $378,000.  And number two... 
[00:31:00]  Wait, who's making that?  Head of the commission that runs it.  See, I told you.  It does trickle down  because you've got to pay people.  Well, does he have other things that he does?  Like, is this just one of his jobs  or is this his only gig?  I think it's his only job.  He has the entire 9-11 memorial commission.  Now, Jimmy, I've got a question for you.  It's a career for people.  They are making a good living off this.  And then their excuse would be,  well, someone's got to organize this.  And it takes time and my efforts  and blah, blah, blah.  That's a lot of money.  What's your question?  That seems to be a lot.  Who's going to be the first one to spoof this? 
[00:31:30]  Where, you know,  I could see an Amy Schumer-type sketch  where she's walking in  and they do have pictures  of the towers on fire.  They do have pictures  where you can buy the rubble.  He's pitching an idea.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's a good idea.  It's a very funny idea.  I mean, for a sketch.  SNL wouldn't do it,  but they should do it.  They wouldn't do it.  SNL don't know the balls  or something like that.  Right.  Well, I mean, that's a hard one to tackle,  because, you know,  even though you're being really sarcastic 
[00:32:00]  and attacking the idea of the museum,  if it's misinterpreted, you know.  And just doing it conjures up, you know.  Right.  It's like, ah, this is taboo.  But it should, though.  Like, it really is revolting.  What they're doing is not just shitty.  It's revolting.  Yeah.  Right.  All right, Paul.  I agree.  One more question.  It's kind of off topic.  I've been wondering about for a while.  Sure.  I go way back with you guys.  The second week of WNEW.  Oh, where were we at the first week?  And so far, over the last 20 years, 
[00:32:30]  you guys have talked about every single member  that's ever been a part of the staff,  except for one guy,  which I never hear you mention anymore,  and that's Spaz.  You guys really not like him?  No, we've talked about him a lot.  Yeah, he's been come up a lot, actually.  We've talked about him plenty.  Spaz went on to...  Spaz was one of the most amazing...  Hilarious.  ...characters we've ever had on our show.  It was unbelievable,  the stuff he would come up with  and did for our show.  And one day, he came to me and Ann,  and he didn't want to be Spaz anymore.  Yeah, he wanted to be...  What was his name? 
[00:33:00]  Kevin.  Kevin.  And I sat him down.  I'm like, are you kidding me?  This is killing.  Yeah.  But he didn't want to be the...  I want to be Kevin.  He wanted to be Kevin,  and he wanted to continue,  and we're like, well, all right,  but there's no money in it  for you to be Kevin.  People want you to continue as Spaz,  and Spaz was him.  That's the weird part.  He wasn't putting on a character.  We say one of the most amazing characters ever,  but that was him.  That was him.  He wasn't this Kevin guy,  which was his real name. 
[00:33:30]  What, did his girlfriend push him into it?  Then he tried to sue us.  Another one that tried to sue us, Grace.  Another guy that leaves here  and then has to, like,  trash the shit out of us.  Yeah, yeah.  What did he want?  Because we didn't give him  a good opportunity or something.  Oh, no.  Did he really?  Yeah.  I forgot that he tried to sue us.  Yeah.  I remember he moved, like,  two hours away,  and you guys used to ridicule him  every day  because he would have, like,  a two-hour trip in.  Sloatsburg.  Yeah, he literally spent  half his day  just coming to the city.  He's a cop now 
[00:34:00]  up in Sloatsburg.  Is that real?  Yeah, yeah.  I would love to see a picture of him.  I have never heard him mentioned  ever since he left.  No, we have.  We've talked about him.  Because I didn't really know Spaz,  and I know a lot about the situation,  and I've heard it on the air.  Yeah, he comes up.  Me and Opie usually will send a text  to each other  whenever one of us reads  something that he had predicted  years ago  that actually comes to fruition.  That's what's so creepy.  There's so many of those dumb things  where he was like,  you know,  people will be being operated on  by robots. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  And we're like,  ah, Spaz, you idiot.  And then it's like,  robot doctors operate.  And I'm like,  I fire up a text to Opie,  you see this shit?  Or kitty litter  to absorb hurricanes.  Right.  And they're working on, like,  trying to figure out how to...  Yeah, they were like...  Less than the strength of hurricanes.  Of hurricanes by dropping  super absorbent material,  like the fucking kitty litter.  Right.  The guy had fucking...  He had some ideas.  Or the pointing the microwave  at tornadoes,  the microwave ovens.  Right.  He said,  if everybody points  a microwave oven at a tornado, 
[00:35:00]  it would stop the tornado.  And it's like...  And then I read,  stopping tornadoes  with microwaves.  Like, fuck, Opie just...  That's so weird.  Maybe he was a weird savant,  like, technological genius  or something.  Yeah, well...  Or just an absolute idiot.  Like, if you put a million monkeys  in front of a million typewriters,  one of them will hit the Bible over.  One of my...  One of my favorites was  when he said that he could  break into any safe,  I think it was.  The perfect crime.  And then we hung him  from the ceiling.  In a Spider-Man outfit.  In a Spider-Man outfit 
[00:35:30]  and gave him the whole show  to try to break into the safe.  You have to cut  a perfectly symmetricized hole.  Right.  What an idiot.  But what was his thing  about breaking into safes?  I forget now.  It's been so long.  He said that he could, like,  pick the lock.  Oh, he could hear it or something.  Yeah, he'd hear the tumblers.  And he never...  So we were able to get a safe.  We got a whole, like,  special effects team.  Spider spaz.  We hung him from...  We hung him from the ceiling.  Made him try to...  But in that Mission Impossible way.  Yeah, yeah.  He was like... 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, we wanted it to be  like Mission Impossible.  Right.  So he was perfectly balanced.  Like, these guys worked hard  to make sure he hung  from the ceiling perfectly.  What's he look like?  Is there a picture of him?  I don't even know  what he looks like.  He's like a crazy-looking ginger.  There he is.  Wow.  That's what the killer mosquito.  Looks like Macklemore.  Oh, yeah.  But he was...  He was really, like,  just incredibly naive.  One time,  we were talking about tampons.  He didn't understand  girls and their tampons  or something.  Oh, my God.  Right.  So we put him in  the bathroom.  Do we have that clip, E-Rock? 
[00:36:30]  And he screamed.  It's a great clip.  He screamed when he figured out  where the tampons went  and what they were for  and then he saw her  take one out  and throw it in the toilet  and he screamed.  If E-Rock could find that clip,  that's pretty amazing.  That was funny, man.  It was going to be  on our cringe CD  that the lawyer said no to.  Yeah.  We don't have many spaz clips  in Dillette,  but I was just previewing  the giant mosquito.  Oh, yeah.  It's still funny.  Well, we can play it  until break.  Encephalitis.  Who cares?  No, I don't care.  Encephalitis.  That's when I stopped 
[00:37:00]  and I was like,  this is still good.  Yeah, he just moved on.  He just finally  just moved on  and that was it.  I don't know.  Oh, God.  He was with Beba.  Beba?  Beba.  Did they ever get married?  No.  He didn't marry Beba?  No, Beba ended up,  him and Beba  ended up breaking up.  Okay.  And then Beba  married that sick boy guy.  Oh, the rest?  Oh, the guy  that got us in trouble  with The Rock.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:37:30]  And then I hear  tell they've since divorced.  Oh.  Beba was her name?  B-A-B-E-A?  No, he called her Beba.  Beba.  Beba.  Instead of saying baby,  he was like,  hey, Beba.  So we would call her Beba.  Beba.  Beba?  Is that him?  That's The Rock  walking out on our show.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Wait.  The Rock says...  Wait, go back.  Was the guy in studio?  Yes.  This is online.  Sick boy?  Yeah, because he wanted to... 
[00:38:00]  Appreciate you guys  having me on.  Thank you.  Okay.  Book signing starting  at 7 tonight.  Tower Records,  Eastport Street.  And I'm still plugging  this shit.  And the East Village.  Gotta thank The Rock  for stopping on by  today.  Appreciate it.  And he walked out.  Why don't we have  the part where...  I don't know.  I don't even know  how they got this.  I don't know what it is.  And then we were  probably like,  ah, fuck The Rock.  He's never gonna  amount to anything anyway.  Well, I did say that  on our show.  I said we would  always be bigger than him. 
[00:38:30]  I did say that.  Oops.  You know, WWE,  I found out,  recently went into  full recovery mode  when The Rock walked out.  Like, they were pissed  that he walked out  because they cared  so much about your show.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, we were...  We were pretty important  to the WWF.  The Rock.  Apparently, that's why  they flew you to California  for WrestleMania  and all that.  Like, Anaheim.  Yeah.  I still got the chairs.  I don't know.  Who has mine?  I don't.  I don't have chairs  from that WrestleMania.  Really?  They came to somebody.  That was the 2000  WrestleMania?  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  I still got the chairs.  Yeah.  You've got to give that  to Sam.  Fuck that.  It's in my basement.  Would you want that, Sam?  It's in my bar.  Yeah, I have a collection  of chairs.  From WrestleMania?  Well, from various events.  You have a collection  of chairs.  I'll give him one  if I could smash it  over his head.  Cushion sign or steel sign?  Steel sign.  All right.  I'm going to smash you  in the face of it.  What's the rarest  wrestling thing you own?  For our wedding,  Jess gave me  a worn gold dust outfit.  Oh, shit. 
[00:39:30]  For your wedding?  Yeah.  Did you have to wear it  during your honeymoon?  No.  Did you leave a freak  come into it?  No.  Did you like it?  I was there for the unveiling  and, man, was Sam excited.  Oh, I bet.  It was the after party  at the bar, right?  Yeah.  Was there a skid mark  in the back from gold dust?  No, but the crotch of it  is worn out.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  Why?  That's how I knew  it was real.  Do you smell it?  No.  It's not about that.  It's not a Shane McMahon  bachelor party shirt, but...  Oh, that's true.  You got that.  You just asked me that question  so you could brag 
[00:40:00]  about your Shane McMahon  bachelor party shirt.  I actually forgot about that.  Oh, probably.  The SS.  Shane McMahon.  All right, Paul.  Thanks for the call, buddy.  Sure.  All right.  Let's see.  10,000.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Bobby  in Kentucky.  Bobby.  Hey there, Bobby.  Hey, gentlemen.  Hey, Bobby.  This gift shop thing  is not as sick as,  I don't know,  bringing a victim's shoe  to the oddest things  you own in Cleveland.  Yeah, I got to be honest  with you.  That happened in Chicago.  We did the oddest thing  you own,  and I think it was a girl. 
[00:40:30]  She actually brought a shoe  from 9-11.  She did.  And I,  that never,  that never sat well with me.  Yeah, it was a weird thing.  That never sat well with me.  There was something  extremely creepy about it.  I forget how we played it  on the air,  to be honest with you,  but I remember after the show,  I was like, man,  there was something  just not right about that.  Yeah, because, you know,  someone's fucking shoe  was probably dead.  Right.  Was she the one  that was complaining  that she didn't win?  Yeah, yeah,  and then she's complaining.  I think we didn't, 
[00:41:00]  I think we just didn't want  any part of it,  so we,  I don't know,  maybe someone had  something better.  I don't even remember  what won.  I don't remember that at all.  But I do remember,  I think it was drunk.  I do remember,  we were all just like,  wow, that's fucking,  that's fucking dark.  I remember all the papers  that were all over  New York City,  like in Brooklyn even,  there was just papers  from the Trade Center.  All just fucking work papers.  And they were stuck  to the fences,  like,  because the wind would blow them  and they would just like,  sit on the fence.  All over Manhattan. 
[00:41:30]  All over,  like Brooklyn too.  Yeah, miles away.  Across the water.  Miles away the paper was.  And there was something  that's like,  oh, you know,  I want to check that out.  I want to look at,  and then you just get creeped out.  It's like,  nah, you know what?  I don't know.  I have a piece of paper from it.  It was,  Voss at the time,  was like,  he knew some girl.  We went down  and she was a volunteer.  So we put on masks  and went on the site.  And she had saved  a few things from it,  like just papers and things.  And she gave me one.  It was just like 
[00:42:00]  from somebody's office.  It was weird.  But I didn't feel weird  taking it though.  It's a piece of history,  I thought.  Right.  Yeah.  And yeah,  I had it framed at one point.  Oh man.  Everything you get is framed.  Yeah.  This is one of the guys.  Yeah.  Thank you, Bobby.  Let's go to Tim in New York.  I think this is one of the guys  you blocked over  that whole discussion.  Tim.  Yeah,  no,  I just said that  to cut the line.  I have nothing to contribute.  Slobo!  I don't know.  Oh.  There you go.  A little Slobo action for you. 
[00:42:30]  Oh boy.  All right.  At least he said he had nothing to contribute  and he came through.  Right.  With nothing.  So what's up with this Vince McMahon thing?  He lost 43...  No.  The stock lost 43%.  Yeah,  and one day...  On Friday?  On Friday,  Vince McMahon lost  $357 million.  Wow.  Taking him out of the billionaire category.  He's not a billionaire.  Okay,  job! 
[00:43:00]  All work!  Right.  I sound like Arthur.  Uh-huh.  That's the point.  He lost $357 million in one day.  In one day.  That's a lot of money.  Holy...  It serves him right.  Why?  He should pay his wrestlers better.  Oh.  A lot of them make a lot of money.  Nah,  I've been hearing the stories lately,  man,  and I'm surprised  that some of the numbers  those guys were making  at the height of their popularity  and to know that he has...  He has $357 million to lose. 
[00:43:30]  Like,  his lifestyle will not change  whatsoever  after losing $357 million in one day.  You feel that?  He's gonna...  Holy fuck,  does he feel that?  Yeah,  but imagine if you were...  What does he feel,  though?  Imagine if you were a billionaire  and you walk around being like,  I'm a fucking billionaire.  Right.  And then you're not.  And not only are you not,  you're $357 million shy  of being a billionaire.  Take whatever percentage of that  out of your bank.  Oh,  I understand.  It would be a little tragic.  He, 
[00:44:00]  uh,  he got greedy.  Wall Street gave him the stink face.  That's what it was.  Yeah.  It's a Wall Street stink face.  Wall Street stink face.  Put him in the fucking turnbuckle,  pulled their pants down,  and shoved their ass  right against his face.  Are you saying that Wall Street  inducted him into the  Kiss My Ass Club?  Yes,  they did.  Kiss my ass.  Yes.  Yes,  they did.  So what was the deal?  He fucked...  What deal did he fuck up?  He didn't fuck up,  man.  He doesn't fuck up deals.  He fucked up a deal.  This is all about fucking up a deal.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:44:30]  He,  from what I've read,  he came out before the TV deal was signed  and said the next TV deal we sign  is going to be this incredible thing.  Right.  And he had big,  Vince McMahon-sized expectations  that all the investors had.  So all the investors are,  buy,  buy,  buy,  buy,  buy.  And then on Friday  they announced their TV deal  with NBCUniversal.  They're staying on all the same channels.  It's not a bad deal,  but it's not...  It just doesn't equal his hype. 
[00:45:00]  Right.  What kind of deal were they  thinking he was going to make?  I mean,  they were thinking he was going to...  That they were freaking out  and buying like they were.  Like he was talking about,  I think that they were thinking  he was going to triple his fees  that he got.  See,  here's the deal.  If you're a CEO like this,  Vince McMahon,  you know,  is a voice,  he's the voice of WWE.  You can't hype up shit.  The market always knows,  like,  when you get a corporation  that has these,  you know,  CEOs that speak, 
[00:45:30]  they always play it down.  Well,  we're a little concerned  about next quarter's numbers.  We're hopefully optimistic  and things like that.  And then when they have good numbers,  the stock takes off.  If you're hyping like Vince does,  thinking he's in the ring with a mic,  and then it doesn't come through  to the expectations  of the stockholders,  it takes a shit.  Plus,  that was coming off the network  where investors thought  the network was going to have  a million subscribers.  Yeah.  And when they announced 
[00:46:00]  their numbers in April,  it had just under  700,000 subscribers.  So they're short about 33% there.  Yeah.  Which is a big...  Three million a month,  let's fuck up with 30 million a year.  What would it really...  A little more than...  Ah, whatever.  Huh.  That's a big difference.  Yeah, so that's on the heels  of the network.  Heels!  That's right.  Heels.  Nice.  Oh, I get it.  Baby faces in this shit.  Wordplay humor.  Fuck you.  What are you,  a heel or something?  So yeah,  Vince McMahon is no longer... 
[00:46:30]  No longer a billionaire.  Aw, poor Vince.  I can't imagine  he was easy to deal with.  Do you think he was cranky?  I think he might have been.  Name five people  that are happy about this.  I would think Eric Bischoff.  Eric Bischoff is one.  Probably happy.  Ted Turner is probably  happy about it somewhere.  Ted Turner is very happy  about it.  Ted Turner.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he owned WCW for wrestling.  Who else?  Let's see.  I would say  Bret Hart is probably  happy about it somewhere. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  Bret Hart's probably psyched.  Smiling.  Celebrating a little bit.  I think so.  Even though he's employed  by Diabry now.  Need two more.  I would say  Bob Costas  is probably happy about it  because Tom Vince  slapped the papers  out of his hand.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah.  Bob Belzer?  He leaned in.  Let me tell you something.  Right.  That's great.  And who could be  the fifth person?  It's got to be a good one.  John Stossel?  I'll bet CM Punk  is at home  happy with his decision.  Oh, okay.  What about someone 
[00:47:30]  like a Mick Foley?  Mick Foley is.  You know why?  Because Mick Foley  just announced  that he was not  going to re-sign  for his merchandising  legends deal  with WWE.  Ah.  Before this,  he was like,  no, I'm not signing there.  Maybe he's happy.  Why isn't he re-signing?  He went on his Facebook  and he said  that the deals  that some of the wrestlers  were getting  for the video game rights  were much lower  than they used to be  and his deal  that he got,  even though he was  in the game  three times, 
[00:48:00]  obviously,  because there's  three faces of Foley,  was far lower  than it used to be  and so because of  stuff like that,  he was not going  to re-sign.  How much do you think  they get to be  in the video game?  But doesn't Vince  own his likeness,  kind of?  How is he going  to make that money back?  I think that when,  I think that it's complicated.  I think the way it works  is that Vince owns,  Vince can use the names  all he wants  and he can use 
[00:48:30]  the home video  and all that,  but he still pays  home video rights  to all those guys,  even after they're  out of the company.  Right.  But in terms of  producing new images  of them,  I think they have  to be on board  with that.  The people themselves.  So what do you think  they get paid?  I've heard that,  I think it's like  50 grand or something  for a video game.  It's not that much.  You know,  that's a lot of money  and you shouldn't  say that's not...  And I'm assuming  like somebody  who could argue  that, well,  this video,  like The Rock 
[00:49:00]  would probably make  a lot more than  50 grand  because he's like,  well, people are  buying this because  they want to be  The Rock or John Cena.  But like a scrub  would probably get  like 50 grand.  Brooklyn Brawler?  Brooklyn Brawler  would probably get  like 40 grand.  Yeah.  He probably just gets  a few free copies.  You think J.R.  That's all he gets.  J.R. is happy?  J.R. is probably...  He's probably just  at home in Oklahoma  chuckling to himself.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh my God.  Look at that.  Oh my God.  Vince,  he lost a lot  of money there today.  It's good shit.  It's good shit.  It's good shit. 
[00:49:30]  I'm glad he lost  his money.  Who knows a good  wrestler?  Clubber Shirk.  Clubber Shirk?  I've never actually...  I mean,  I'm a big wrestling guy.  I've never heard  of Clubber Shirk.  Up and comer.  Oh, okay.  Is that right?  Yes.  Where does he wrestle?  Everywhere.  He does the club.  That's his big finishing...  Sam,  some are saying...  Yes.  He spins his arm  in a circle in club form.  Hits you with it.  It sounds great.  Clubber Shirk.  Sounds like an ass.  Some are saying  that the WWE stock  fell quicker than Owen Hart.  Is that true?  Oh my God. 
[00:50:00]  Is that true?  Some are saying.  Some are saying.  People are saying.  You asked me if it's true.  The stock fall,  it metaphorically fell,  whereas Owen Hart  quite literally fell.  So you could not compare  those two speeds.  You're sure.  That's an inappropriate question.  Because people are saying.  That's an inappropriate  question to ask.  Oh, all right.  I don't know what people  would say that,  but that's not...  That's totally out of line.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm glad you asked  to clear that up,  but that's out of line.  Oh.  For the record.  Trying to think  of more stock terms.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  There's a cat one.  What's the cat bounce one?  Oh, the dead cat bounce.  I mean, I see where  you're going with it,  but again,  I can't say anything.  It's out of line.  I was just thinking  dead cat bounce.  I'm just thinking.  That's all.  You think Vince was  making Owen jokes  in the office?  God damn it.  Yeah.  It felt like Owen.  Yeah.  Do you think people  made money  putting some put skis on it?  Ah, there you go.  Some put skis.  Oh, he's got his 
[00:51:00]  sneak in a line  about the Polish hammer.  I love the Polish hammer.  Some put skis.  I got one.  You got one?  Oh, okay.  Hopefully the company  will be on the dusty roads  to recovery.  Whoa, I like that.  That's good.  That's a good one.  I kind of like that one.  Clever.  Without being crass.  That's your motto, right?  That's your t-shirt.  Yeah.  Who else do we got?  I hope everybody  is 
[00:51:30]  Coco  beware  of this investment.  That's pretty good.  Thank you.  It wasn't pretty good.  Thank you.  It's pretty good.  That was good compared  to the 9-11 museum.  This stock is shakier  than the earthquake.  Oh, that's  no.  No?  Can we work  whoop-ass in there  somehow?  I guess somebody  opened a can of  whoop-ass all over  this stock.  Dude, do you got  the Mark Cuban thing? 
[00:52:00]  These guys,  the stupid sharks  bombed horribly  on the billboards.  Oh, good.  Horribly.  They're playing on Fox  right now in the middle.  Could you find that?  Yeah.  Oh, boy,  do they bomb.  Oh, how about this one?  Yeah.  Dude, love this stock.  See?  Yeah.  This stock is a bad  investment for all  mankind.  Pretty good, huh?  Yeah, I'll get one.  You will.  You have to be a  fucking Hulkamaniac 
[00:52:30]  to buy this shit.  It's just...  It doesn't make any sense.  It plows through  something that does  not fit the criteria.  It used to be hot,  but now this stock  has gone stone cold.  Oh, shit.  There you go.  Man, that's a good one.  Let's say hi to Kyle  in North Carolina.  Kyle.  Hi, Kyle.  What's up, guys?  Huh?  I want to see if we can get  a take on Boardroom Jimmy 
[00:53:00]  on the WWE stop.  I don't know if  Boardroom Jimmy's around  these days.  Boardroom Jimmy,  I did twice.  That was only twice?  Well, four times.  It's shit, cunt, K-Rock.  Yes.  Awful, fucking,  dump K-Rock.  And I don't think  I've done that before  or since.  No, huh?  No, it became...  Boardroom Jimmy kind of  became...  Ted.  Ted Sheckler.  Yeah, but Boardroom Jimmy  was pretty damn funny.  I thought you did  more than four times.  No, not many.  Maybe I did,  but it was very few.  But thank you, sir.  Boardroom Jimmy would tell you  this stock needs 
[00:53:30]  an undertaker.  Ah!  Nice!  That's a good one.  Or a pallbearer.  Oh, wait.  Mike in New York.  Mike?  Hey, the WWE stock  right now  is a Brahma bull market.  Oh, my God.  It's so bad.  I love it.  It's so bad.  I love it.  Let's go to Jordan  in Oyster Bay.  Oh, I got one.  He's done.  Okay, Jordan.  Yes?  Yeah.  Do you think Vince  was shock-mastered  about the news? 
[00:54:00]  The shock-mastered.  That's terrible.  What?  That is bad.  I got one.  Okay.  If you bought this stock,  you better, Jimmy,  superfly your ass  out of there.  Let's move on  to the billboards.  Yeah, that was bad.  The billboard awards.  Yikes.  Oh, it's pleasing.  You had the cocky shark guys.  Although, I like Mark Cuban.  What about Mr. Wonderful?  You had Mr. Wonderful  on the post show.  He's an asshole.  Period.  He's an asshole, okay? 
[00:54:30]  I don't give a fuck  he sold this company.  He was a dick.  I remember listening to that.  He's a dick.  Yeah, he was.  I don't give a fuck  he made a billion dollars  off some kind of  software development deal  or something.  He's a dick.  Yeah.  He really is.  Mark Cuban and,  what's his name?  Mr. Wonderful?  Mr. Wonderful.  He even calls himself  Mr. Wonderful?  Why is he Mr. Wonderful?  Because he makes  wonderful deals, I guess.  I don't know.  Whatever happened  to Mr. Wonderful  from WWF?  He's still alive,  but he's got a giant  handlebar mustache  and one of his arms 
[00:55:00]  is a lot bigger  than the other.  What?  Okay.  Yeah.  Why is one of his arms  bigger than the other?  It was one of his arms  like atrophied or something.  Can you show me  a picture of this?  He really hides it well,  but I think...  Oh, like Radar O'Reilly?  Wait, I forgot  who Mr. Wonderful was.  Paul Orndorff.  Oh, right.  Remember he used to come out  Mr. Wonderful.  Right, right, right.  And he was just giant.  Oh, this guy.  Right, right, right.  Here you go.  You can kind of see it  in this photo.  You see how this arm  has muscle  and then this one  just hangs it inside.  Oh, it's kind of hanging there. 
[00:55:30]  Okay, yeah.  You see the...  I can't tell you.  You've got to make it bigger.  It's going to be  a pixelated nap in there.  Mr. Wonderful.  Uh-oh.  I lost the picture.  Here it is.  What's wrong with his arm,  did they say?  Like you see how this is...  Oh, my gosh.  And the other one is...  Not so wonderful anymore.  Right.  Does he have an injury  and he can't lift anymore?  No, it's like atrophied.  Why is it atrophied?  I don't know.  I don't know how  he got to the size  that he was  and I don't know.  Oh, we all know how, Sam.  That's some steroid problems. 
[00:56:00]  Let's say hi to Abraham  in Arizona.  Abraham.  Yeah, don't get Jimmy  the Superfly Snooker  on this stock.  Fuck yeah.  Let's say hi to Greg  in Philly.  Greg?  Vince McMahon  must feel like  the Honky Tonk Man  after Friday.  I don't get it.  I will tell you  this makes sense.  It might be over.  Brett in Illinois.  Yeah, anybody  who buys this stock  got to be off their rockers.  I like that one. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, there you go.  We're back in.  Vince is starting...  We're back in.  Vince is starting  to feel the Harlem heat.  Oh!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  This stock is far  from sensational  Sherry.  Oof.  Yeah, how about this?  Uh-huh.  This fucking stock's  got me in a figure four  leg lock.  It's great stock.  It's really...  It's working  moolah.  Moolah.  The amazing moolah.  Oh, he's losing...  Vince lost a lot of moolah.  A lot of moolah.  Vince lost all of  his fabulous moolah. 
[00:57:00]  Bill in Texas.  Bill.  Hey, Jimmy,  I've got one for you.  Sure.  Hey, watch out.  Don't go for that spot.  It's just snookered.  Your phone is...  I heard snookered.  You've been snookered.  You've been snookered.  I don't know what one of them.  You know how you listen to it.  All right.  We're going to find out.  I need to find out  about Mr. Wonderful's  hurt arm.  This guy knows.  Chris in Indiana.  Call screen today?  Yeah, the call screening 
[00:57:30]  is horrible today.  Horrible.  Who put that phone call on?  Hold on, hold on.  Who's doing it?  Who's doing it today?  Our intern, Adrian.  Oh.  Oh, wait.  Tell her to do it right.  She hasn't been the same  since she fell in that feed bag  in the pet store.  Go ahead, Chris.  Yeah, back in the day,  he owned up  and had a big feud  with Hogan  and he injured his arm  like the first two weeks  into it  and they were making  so much money  instead of taking time off  and letting it heal.  It continued to work  for like the next three months  making a mad amount of money 
[00:58:00]  and that's why  his arm's all screwed up  to this day.  No kidding.  He had to headline  WrestleMania 1.  Oh, wow.  That was the Hogan feud.  That was WrestleMania 1.  What's his name?  Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff.  Was he popular at one point?  Yeah, he was the biggest bad guy  in the company  with Piper.  What year did he get out?  Well, I mean,  he was still wrestling  deep into the 90s  but...  Jesus.  He should.  I mean, he was big  in like 85.  All right,  can we see the Sharks  on the Billboard musical  was last night?  Was it good, funny? 
[00:58:30]  Not good.  Mark Cuban and...  And Mr. Wonderful.  And Mr. Wonderful.  Kevin O'Leary,  that's his name, right?  I don't know.  He's just a dick.  I call him dick.  What?  No, Travis just said it is  because Travis and me  watched Shark Tank  religiously.  Oh.  I kind of like Shark Tank.  It's the best show on TV.  I kind of like it.  I was the one  over the weekend  I was amazed by.  Fuck.  You see DDP Yoga  on Shark Tank?  No, I did not.  He had his foot in his hand.  I guess I haven't seen  all of them.  I don't watch that at all.  I watched that shit  on demand. 
[00:59:00]  On demand.  Loops of it.  Oh, the lady  that came up with the boxes.  What was that one?  I missed that one.  They just fold open.  Yeah, they were  collapsible boxes.  But they fold open.  You don't have to put  the folds in and all that shit.  The flaps and the folds  and shit.  I watched a couple weeks ago  a guy had a collapsible kayak.  Well, that was the shit.  Yeah, it was awesome, right?  I saw that, yeah.  But they wouldn't invest  with him because  the production  was too much of a cost.  I'll be a customer  but not an investor.  That's right.  They're just dicks.  There's that one woman 
[00:59:30]  with the short hair  that doesn't have a dime  to her name.  I'm convinced of it.  She never invests  in anything.  Barbara Corcoran?  Barbara Corcoran  doesn't have a dime  to her name.  She's a real estate mogul.  She is not.  She sold one apartment.  She doesn't invest  in anything, really?  No, she never buys anything.  That's hilarious.  She doesn't have a dime.  Are these guys  really stuck with these people?  Yeah.  You see the thing.  It says these Shark Tank guys  are investing their own money  in these companies.  The guy from FUBU  buys stuff.  That nice Canadian guy  who likes race cars  buys stuff.  Barbara Corcoran  doesn't spend a dime. 
[01:00:00]  So why can't we just be  part of the Shark Tank?  You don't have  that kind of money.  All right.  Well, back some of these guys.  Like, you've got to hang out  with me and Travis  because then you guys  are, like, really rich.  Yeah.  But when you hang out  with the Shark Tank guys,  you guys are the Sam and Travises.  Oh, man.  That's a great point.  Never want to be them.  All right.  Let's do this.  So you have The Dick  and our old friend Mark Cuban  on the Billboard Music Awards  last night.  I wonder if he's the Dick.  He is the Dick.  We should get him on our show.  Why? 
[01:00:30]  So you can let him know?  We'll handle him differently  than you did.  I thought he was great.  The only reason he was on Sam's show  is because we said,  fuck him.  I think so.  I think you're right.  Why did you say fuck him?  Because he's a Dick.  All right.  Go ahead.  This is their banter last night.  This was horrendous.  We're here to announce  our latest investments.  We've just spent $3.2 billion  to buy a hot new company  called Beatdowns by Solange.  That was a great, 
[01:01:00]  great elevator pitch.  You know, country music  is a growth industry, too.  But getting a number one hit  is really hard.  Getting four to one  was almost impossible.  But here's a country band  that has done just that.  Cuban knows it, Bob.  Cuban's not dumb  when it comes to this shit.  Bob!  Mr. Wonderful  couldn't have had worse timing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then he just comes in.  That's a great elevator pitch.  What? 
[01:01:30]  Trampling over the audience reaction.  Nobody's paying attention to him.  What did you think of...  Beatdowns by Solange!  It wasn't the best joke,  but it made me dislike the audience  for being objecting to it.  Yeah, you didn't like  the audience thing.  I didn't think it bombed completely.  It got like a little reaction.  Yeah, but then listen to...  I don't think Cuban bombed completely.  The delivery was horrible.  Oh, yeah.  But I think there's no doubt about it.  Your guy's Mr. Wonderful  was...  He was a huge bomb.  That line stunk.  Because he thinks everybody there 
[01:02:00]  watches their show.  Oh, yeah.  And he doesn't realize  that everybody's reacting  to the thing Cuban said,  so no, he's paying attention  to what he's saying anyway.  He was trying to get his line.  It was time for him to talk.  Mr. Wonderful.  Mr. Wonderful.  What a dick.  Had to get his shit in.  We're here to announce  our latest investments.  Look at Cuban trying to sell it.  He spent $3.2 billion  to buy a hot new company  called Beatdowns by Solange.  That was a great, 
[01:02:30]  great elevator pitch.  You know, country music...  Oh, wow.  Yeah, country music.  That was a great elevator pitch.  Great elevator pitch.  Yikes.  Did we do Coco Beware of that stock?  I said that one.  I did.  No, I did.  Yeah, all right.  You guys made fun of me for it.  Is there a Wendy Richter  in the WWE?  Yeah.  The stock fell so hard  it registered  on the Wendy Richter scale.  I like that. 
[01:03:00]  All right, okay.  Can you smell the stock  the rock is pushing?  I don't know,  Pete in Indiana.  I got one.  Everybody get ready  to fucking crack up.  All right.  This stock did...  This stock lost so much money  they should buy it in China.  Oh, China.  The, uh...  Yeah.  Somebody took an axe  of demolition  to this stock.  Oh.  Crash.  Vince is gonna have  to pack his bags 
[01:03:30]  and move to a cheaper neighborhood.  X-Pack?  Yeah.  Yeah.  X-Pack is the guy.  Two-pack.  Two-pack.  Two-pack.  Two-pack.  Two-pack is the rapper.  Two-pack is the rapper.  Two-pack is the rapper.  That's close enough.  They have to X-Pack his bags.  I know.  X-Pack.  Yeah, two-pack stunk.  I know.  This stock is really  Degeneration-X.  It was just terrible.  That was the bit.  Yeah.  I think we sort of  did this one, too. 
[01:04:00]  But Ryan in Jersey.  Ryan.  Yo.  Hey.  After this stock,  Vince McMahon's gonna be  just a million-dollar man.  True.  Oh, right.  Right.  You know,  how can we work  Virgil into this?  Oh, that's tough.  Send it his dumb table.  Vince McMahon still has  way more money than Virgil.  Yes.  That's true.  The stock Virgil'd.  That's pretty funny.  The stock Virgil'd.  Or fell alone.  Poor Virgil. 
[01:04:30]  That other woman  bugs me on Shark Tank, too.  Oh, um.  With the longer hair.  Yeah, what is it?  Laurie Grenier.  She's like, what,  a home shopping lady  or something, right?  All she's got is QVC.  QVC, one of those, right.  Everybody comes in  and pitches her stuff,  and she's like,  I can take you to QVC.  Right.  Every product that comes in,  I can take you to QVC.  I can't stand that show.  They just stand there  and judge people's ideas.  No, I'm not giving you money.  Fuck you.  And Mr. Wonderful  always has this look  on his face like,  you're quite a piece of shit.  Yeah.  I'm so much better than you.  I've seen, 
[01:05:00]  I saw one just like recently.  I don't even know  why it was on,  but it was the little  effeminate black kid  with the bow ties  that no one would give money to.  What was it?  Good.  He made little bow ties.  But we already have bow ties.  I know.  Who makes his bow ties special?  Because he hand makes them  or something.  His grandma bought him  a sewing machine.  It was great.  How much is he going to make?  Eight a year?  I know.  It's just it.  He's not making a lot of bow ties.  And that was it. 
[01:05:30]  It's like,  oh,  they're going to mass produce them,  but then it takes away  from the kind of little...  He's like the cronut guy  of bow ties.  He is.  Does he have a patent  on these bow ties?  I don't know.  Can we sell them  to somebody else?  No.  That's what they were talking about.  Speaking of patent,  he's outside our studio.  Pat Oswald.  Oh, there you go.  So we should take a break here.  Wordplay.  And we're going to play  the Spaz thing, right?  The giant mosquito?  The giant mosquito.  For the newer listeners,  Spaz did some great stuff  for our show back in the day.  And this is not a character. 
[01:06:00]  This was him,  I'm telling you.  So we'll play this  and we'll get Pat Oswald  on the show next.  All right,  let's move on  with the giant mosquito,  I believe is next.  Anyway,  what else is going on  in Queens?  It seems to be like,  instead of the flu bug,  we've got a mosquito  going around killing people.  Whoa, there he is.  Whoa, giant mosquito  seen crossing  the Triborough Bridge.  Whoa, whoa.  Giant mosquito.  You're convinced  it's one mosquito  and they're trying 
[01:06:30]  to find this one mosquito.  No, what I meant was  there's a bunch of mosquitoes  under one breed.  So, it's a giant mosquito breed.  What?  The giant mosquito  in Queens  killing people.  Anyway,  what else is going on  in Queens?  It seems to be like,  instead of the flu bug,  we've got a mosquito  going around  killing people.  Apparently,  it affects your immune system  and your brain.  It inflames,  it's called,  I can't even pronounce it.  Here it goes.  Encephalita.  Anyway,  it's a mosquito. 
[01:07:00]  Encephalita.  Look at how hard it's at.  Encephalita.  I don't know.  Encephalita.  Encephalita.  It's Homer Simpson,  everyone.  Did you figure out  how to say that word?  I couldn't pronounce it.  Try again.  I need the word  in front of me  to pronounce it.  All right,  someone give him the word.  I'm sure it's in the newspaper.  Dude,  I was laughing so hard 
[01:07:30]  I just started dry heaving.  Giant mosquito.  Are you?  Yeah.  Giant mosquito.  Look for the giant mosquito story.  Rick eagerly looking  for the giant mosquito story.  I can't even pronounce it.  Encephalita.  Anyway,  it's a mosquito.  All right,  I got it.  All right,  you got the word in front of him.  All right,  go ahead.  Spaz has the word  in front of him.  Third death feared  from Encephalitis.  That's my sister's name. 
[01:08:00]  Encephalitis,  you get your ass over here.  Your sister's spatula  and levore is inside.  Encephalitis.  Encephalitis.  All right,  let's get back  into the giant mosquito story.  And it inflames  the outer layer  of your brain.  Is that what happened?  The mosquito is carrying.  In severe cases,  these are some  of the symptoms  you may get.  Severe headaches,  muscle aches,  high fever,  stiff neck, 
[01:08:30]  disorientation.  Then you go into a coma,  have a couple of tremors,  a convulsion or two.  Then you're in paralysis  and then could die.  Coincidentally enough,  the same thing  that happens  when I'm listening  to K-Talk.  You sure you didn't  get bit by this mosquito?  I'm crying.  I'm laughing so hard.  All right,  let's get back to the tape.  These are the symptoms  that...  people infected  have been showing.  And so,  all throughout yesterday,  residents of Queens  were being sprayed  with bug spray. 
[01:09:00]  Residents are being sprayed?  The residents  are being sprayed?  What?  Wait,  you didn't know  they're spraying...  They're spraying  like sumps  and stagnant pools  of water  and brush.  Not the people.  Damn you!  It's a madhouse!  So you think  they're just  running around  with this spray  and spraying people  as they're going  about their business?  Super soakers  full of DDT. 
[01:09:30]  No.  There were tables  set up with  officers in  that outbreak suit  and they had  they had like  cutter and off.  They were just  spraying people  as they walked  by the table.  That's the picture  I saw.  Oh my God.  If I just like...  If I just like...  You'll shine.  Cracked his head  open right now,  would I be charged  with anything?  Or would it be  a public service?  All right,  let's see.  And so all  throughout...  Hold on,  hold on.  Or a snack.  All right,  hold on.  Let's get back to it.  And so all 
[01:10:00]  throughout yesterday,  residents of Queens  were being sprayed  with bug spray.  Actually,  there are ways  to prevent yourself  from getting hit  with this mosquito  in Queens.  Hit with this mosquito?  Dare he try to say...  What's the word?  Encephalitis.  It's like  you're from  another country.  You know?  I'm going to  pee myself,  I swear to God.  Encephalitis, 
[01:10:30]  where's Bactine?  Where's your  sister Bactine?  It's still a giant  mosquito at this point,  Ant.  Yes.  One large,  giant mosquito.  Thank God  they're spraying  the residents of Queens.  Just walking around  with bug spray.  Spraying the residents.  In Queens.  Wear long-sleeve shirts,  long pants,  socks when outdoors.  Use insect repellent  that includes DEET.  D-E-E-T.  Avoid outdoor activity  from dusk to the dawn.  Remove water  from cars and jars 
[01:11:00]  because that's where  miscues later eggs  and, you know,  settled water.  And check your home  for tight-fitting  screens and doors.  Much like the rules  of going out  during the summer,  you know,  don't wear heavy clothing,  don't run in  100-degree heat.  This is common sense,  people.  Follow it.  Wait a minute.  You're telling people  to follow common sense.  I am stupefied, man. 
[01:11:30]  What?  It's common sense,  people.  Follow it.  Yes.  All right.  Let's move on here.  Many people should know  these things anyway,  but of course,  we got morons on the TV  and like me on the radio  right now.  That's true.  Telling you all the  preventing causes to do.  Anyway,  we're going to get right  back to music  and we're going to kick it off.  Actually,  it would have been  Ren Stromstein 
[01:12:00]  and we're going to do  Doohost.  Yeah.  Anyway,  we got some  more news along the way  we're going to talk sports  after this next song break.  There's Doohost.  We are WICR  where we break  new ground.  That was good.  I hit the note.  I hit the post.  That's what I said  from Encephalitis.  Encephalitis.

[01:17:30]  Very cool.  We didn't know you were  coming in.  And we don't,  you know,  it doesn't matter,  obviously.  It's a nice surprise.  Some people,  we'd be like,  oh,  this is going to be  a problem.  Well,  that's how this started.  Sam goes,  you know,  we got a guest today.  And I looked at my sheet,  I go,  no guest today.  And we all start  rolling our eyes,  like,  oh,  fuck,  who is it going to be?  Some cooking show guy.  Who the fuck  is it going to be?  And then Sam had to,  Sam had to cut us off  at the pass and said,  no,  you're going to like this. 
[01:18:00]  And we're like,  are you sure?  And write,  write the name down.  And then he wrote your name  and we were pleasantly,  yeah,  fold it up on a piece of paper.  Let me open it.  Right.  We were happy.  We were happy.  Slow reveal.  We were very happy  to hear you're,  you're in town.  So I was happy  that you guys  let me come in.  You got a little  heat recently  with your apology tweets.  People were loving those.  Oh,  yeah,  no blowback  from that at all.  Was Salon reasonable  at least?  Oh,  yeah,  very measured  and smart 
[01:18:30]  about,  again,  I,  the,  yeah,  they are my,  it's not even,  it's not even Salon,  it's just this overall,  how can I put this?  Okay,  you know how people  make fun of  the Tea Party  for having this  litmus test  where they will,  the Republicans  have kind of  partially fucked themselves  because there are these,  there's this crazy sliver  of the Tea Party  that if you go  even slightly off,  we will vote you out. 
[01:19:00]  Well,  the same thing  is happening,  again,  I think the bulk  of social justice  warriors,  I think they have  the right idea  for the most part,  but then there's  that vocal sliver  that wants a litmus test  on everything,  and if you deviate  even a little bit,  it's,  you're out  and we have to destroy you.  From the litmus test  they've created  and they've set  the boundaries on it.  Yeah,  exactly.  It makes no,  again,  like,  I got all this,  there's a guy named,  a writer named Steve Saylor 
[01:19:30]  who I completely disagree  with on everything,  like,  I cannot,  but he's also  a really good writer,  so I read him  because it's opinions  I don't agree with  that I,  I want to test  what I believe in  all the time.  Sure.  I read people  I don't agree with,  so,  and he said something  in one of his essays  about political correctness  is a war on noticing,  and I was like,  ah,  shit,  I kind of can't disagree with,  like,  I,  that makes a lot of sense,  that sentence,  so I tweeted that out 
[01:20:00]  and everyone suddenly,  you're a white supremacist,  just like this Steve Saylor guy,  you just quoted him,  no,  I'm quoting,  if a guy  who I totally  don't agree with  says something  that actually kind of nails  me,  then I need to  answer to that,  or at least  be aware of it.  Right,  does that make sense?  But that's not part  of the rule book.  No.  The rule book says  you have to shun everything  that someone says,  no matter what he says,  based on something,  right,  right,  if somebody says  something that offends you, 
[01:20:30]  then everything he said  should offend you.  Get a new rule book.  Right.  Yes,  get a new rule book.  The rule book.  That's one of the reasons  I love doing stand-up  in Washington, D.C.  when I do the improv,  because the audience  are very,  very conservative,  and a lot of them  work in government,  and that's one of the few  conservative audiences  that will go,  oh,  I don't agree with that,  but that was fucking good.  Fucking fine.  Got it.  You know what?  Good point.  Yeah.  So,  as long as you're not  personally wrapped up  in this shit  and can look at it  objectively and go,  okay,  well,  I don't agree with that, 
[01:21:00]  but hey,  I'm happy when someone  I disagree with  makes an excellent point,  because it means  I have to up my game.  Like,  if I just walk through life  going,  well,  everyone who disagrees with me,  we all know  they're idiots anyway,  so it just makes you  soft and lazy  and you don't need  to be present.  See,  maybe I'm wrong.  I look at them  like they're ants  who should be killed  and stepped on.  Yeah,  so I just said,  okay,  I'll just do these,  I will apologize 
[01:21:30]  for tweets I never made.  Oh,  it's fucking great.  And of course,  people heard things  in their head  and gotten...  That's what it is,  because one of the  examples I saw  was so fucking funny.  It's like,  well,  I deleted  that last tweet,  because people were,  you know,  offended by it,  and I do believe  that there were  a lot of heroes...  It was vague.  Yeah,  it was very vague.  Again,  I was saying,  sorry about the last tweet,  already deleted,  you know,  the people who  went through the Holocaust  deserve our respect, 
[01:22:00]  not penis limericks.  Right,  right.  And so in people's head,  they all started like,  what the hell did you see,  you know,  and so...  Not penis limericks.  Yeah.  And it was,  it was,  I keyed it off of,  you know,  when you guys were  going over the,  when you did that  apology clock,  like,  how long can we go?  And then also,  it was off of that,  and also a comedian  named Natasha Leggero,  who is...  Adeline she was.  Oh, boy.  Who made a joke  about the Spaghetti,  when SpaghettiOs  tried to do that tweet. 
[01:22:30]  Right.  For,  for,  for,  for,  it was,  was it Pearl Harbor Day?  Was it Pearl Harbor Day?  Oh, yes.  And it was,  it was a little SpaghettiO  holding a fucking flag.  Holding a flag.  And then,  so later,  she made a reference,  and,  and saying,  you know,  it's,  it's terrible that,  that they should do that  for World War veterans,  and,  and it's even worse  that they should  make them offended  by SpaghettiOs,  because that's one of the  few things they can enjoy.  They can eat,  you know,  not,  and people,  she has to apologize 
[01:23:00]  to our brave,  and she said,  these motherfuckers  face down the Nazi horde,  and my Spaghetti,  isn't that more insulting  to them,  to say that they  would be offended,  but,  and by the way,  that is becoming my new,  I'm starting to collect,  um,  I love moments  when people step in  for another group,  and demand an apology  on their behalf,  and then the other group  says,  no,  we're,  hey,  fuck you,  we're fine,  we're not a bunch  of little babies, 
[01:23:30]  like,  I love when they,  again,  the white knight shit,  but I love when white knights  get called out.  Love it,  yes.  And they just go,  no,  you don't know what the fuck  you're talking about.  Thanks.  I thought that was funny.  Yeah.  You're an idiot.  I remember I was,  um,  when I was in college,  uh,  one of my,  uh,  friends,  uh,  in college was gay,  and,  and I was,  uh,  You didn't know,  did you?  Uh,  well,  I mean,  besides the,  you know,  constant Bronski boy in a loop,  no.  Um,  so, 
[01:24:00]  so we're,  but,  so again,  I was trying to be like,  hey,  I'm down with you,  like,  I understand the oppression  you guys are going through,  and I was saying,  hey,  I watched that,  um,  In Living Color last night,  and those,  the two gay movie critics,  I mean,  that's just offensive.  And that was like,  I'm telling him like,  and like,  and he was,  and he just goes,  what the fuck are you talking about?  That's hilarious.  And,  um,  in the gay community,  we make fun of gay people like that.  Like,  that's the thing that we make fun,  because don't get offended on my behalf.  You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. 
[01:24:30]  You were all wound up,  right?  You're right.  I was,  I was wound up,  I was genuinely,  half genuinely wound up,  and half like,  I'm going to impress this guy.  Right.  And show him how progressive and concerned I am.  How open minded I am.  You need to fucking,  no,  you don't know what you're talking about.  Oh,  shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  And it was just a great douche chill moment.  So,  so I just,  so ever since then,  like,  I've,  I love when the white knights get called out by the people they're protecting.  Yeah.  Leave them alone.  You'll fucking leave me alone.  I don't need your help. 
[01:25:00]  Fine.  Take a hike.  Yeah.  So,  I love that shit.  The apology thing is just out of hand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Apologizing for others.  Like,  the,  the NBC one drove us nuts when Joan Rivers was on and she was being hilarious.  And then the next day,  NBC apologized on behalf of Joan Rivers.  Like,  what the fuck did she say?  And she's like,  I'm not going to fucking apologize for anything.  Yeah.  What was the joke?  Cleveland,  she said something about her apartment being,  uh,  yeah,  go ahead.  Sorry.  It was something about her apartment being smaller than the place that the Cleveland girls had to stay.  And for 10 years.  Fine. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some reference to that.  And it's like,  all those girls suffered unimaginable.  By the way,  that,  here's what I also hate about that,  is NBC had Joan Rivers on and did the,  I mean,  what's she going to say,  right?  Come on,  right?  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Trying to get the ratings for it.  And then when she actually does what they said,  she's going to do that,  we're so sorry.  I don't know what happened there.  You booked Joan Rivers,  you idiots.  And you wanted her to go that far.  And they throw her under the bus by saying her supposed joke.  Oh,  guys,  yeah.  They don't even want to acknowledge that it was a joke. 
[01:26:00]  That's the other thing that drives me crazy.  When someone is offended by something,  a joke,  and it's,  it's not enough for them to go,  well,  I think that's in bed.  They have to go,  and nobody was laughing.  Right,  right.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Let me,  I like to see a tape of that club set,  because I will bet people were dying.  Right.  And you were upset.  Or when they write about it,  and they put quotes around the word joke,  it's like,  you don't need to question that it was a joke.  We all know it was a joke,  but you questioning whether it was a joke by putting quotes around it, 
[01:26:30]  doesn't make it any less of a joke.  Yeah,  then,  because then you're assuming,  um,  what,  that she was trying to hurt people?  Like,  really be serious and hurt someone?  If it wasn't a joke,  then she's really a fucking asshole.  Yeah,  yeah.  But it was a joke.  And everyone knows that.  Yeah,  she's Joan Rivers.  That's got to drive you guys nuts when they put the quotes around a joke.  That's got to be bothersome.  It also drives me crazy when somebody writes either in some essay or some Tumblr post about a joke that you've made, 
[01:27:00]  and they're calling you out for not being funny,  and they themselves are the unfunniest.  Yes.  And they're also when they're,  again,  I don't mind being called out by,  there's been a couple of Tumblr posts I've retweeted,  because the writing is fucking good.  What I hate is when someone calls you out,  and they're just a terrible,  they're boring,  and you can tell they're a boring human being,  and they don't understand,  like,  they've wanted to be funny their whole lives,  and they don't know why.  Yeah,  parties all talk,  and people will just start walking away from me.  Walk away,  yeah.  You know,  human beings are horrible. 
[01:27:30]  They don't,  you know,  and then they're angry at comedians for what is going on over there.  These long-winded paragraph after paragraph of nothing.  But they're,  boredom.  But they're getting an audience,  though.  People are fucking reading their shit.  Well,  they're getting an audience if me or someone else retweets it.  All right,  all right,  gotcha.  Yep.  You give them some heat.  But then you realize.  The other thing,  too,  is when I was doing the apology thing,  and some people were,  some people,  most people were not,  and then there was the small vocal group who started saying,  you know,  oh,  you're only retweeting people who like what you're doing. 
[01:28:00]  You're a fucking coward.  You won't retweet my criticism.  Then I would retweet their criticism,  and they would go,  your followers are attacking me,  you fucking coward.  It's just like,  well,  there's no way I can.  Oh,  you get your fucking guys after me.  Well,  when you put the period before what they,  when you retweet or before you respond to them,  I'm like,  why are you going to put your,  your,  your,  your,  your period before you want your help from your minions?  And it's like,  hey,  cunt,  don't fucking talk to me in a public forum and expect a private discussion. 
[01:28:30]  Right.  You're not roping me into an elevator ride.  Who are you?  Fuck you.  Too bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But again,  I literally,  from the same people,  I got,  you won't retweet my criticism.  You're a coward.  I retweet them.  Your followers attack me.  You are a coward.  Yeah.  Are you saying you can't win on Twitter?  Wow.  It's weird how I realized that last week.  Last week.  There was,  you remember that show Fernwood tonight?  Oh yeah.  No. 
[01:29:00]  On their very first episode,  Martin Mullin and Fred Willard is one of the funniest fucking shows.  It's hilarious.  It's this fake talk show.  They did it in the seventies.  It was a spinoff from Mary Hartman.  Yes,  it was.  Is that really the seventies?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  And Norman Lear and just brilliant.  So they,  on their very first episode,  it's set in Fernwood,  Ohio,  this little town.  It's a local,  like,  you know,  hello Fernwood.  So their first guest,  it's called a meet.  It's like meet a Jew.  And what the premise is this,  a Jewish guy was speeding through Fernwood. 
[01:29:30]  So they,  they were going to give him a ticket.  They go,  Hey,  if you,  if you don't want to pay the ticket,  if you'll come on this show,  so the town of Fernwood can see a Jew,  you don't have to pay the ticket.  And he clearly just went,  yeah,  fine.  So he comes out and,  and Fred Willard and Martin Mull are so genius at being the,  trying to be the open liberal guys.  They're just saying the most offensive stuff.  So they're just like,  so what is,  um,  what's Barbara Streisand up to?  Like what's she doing?  And he goes,  well,  I don't know what her next project is.  I,  I've always enjoyed her. 
[01:30:00]  And then Fred Willard goes,  you guys must be so proud of her.  So then they got all these letters from the ACLU and the league of Catholic bishops.  Like that was the most offensive racist.  It's just horrible.  You're kicking down and blah,  blah,  blah.  Then they get a letter from the anti-defamation league going,  we loved that.  Wow.  That was the funniest shit I've ever seen.  So they just forwarded the letter to all the other.  Yeah.  There.  Now,  yeah,  cause you could,  that could shut them right up. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  It should shut them right up.  Yeah.  The people,  again,  it's the white knight shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just,  I love that.  Coming to the rescue.  I got to fucking find some of those shows.  Cause they were,  how long was it on?  They were really funny.  It was on for a couple of years.  I mean,  it was on nightly and they would riff the whole show.  I mean,  they had a basic outline,  but guests would come on and Martin Mullin,  Fred Willard,  you can watch some segments on,  on YouTube.  I don't know why that like criterion or something one hasn't put out every single episode.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  Amazing.  And then who was that?  Uh,  Frank Duvall.  Uh,  uh,  hang on.  So happy,  happy kind and the,  happy kind and the mirth makers was his band.  And this guy,  happy kind looks like he'd look like the most suicidal.  Yes.  He's trying to head.  And he was the actual,  the,  um,  a music guy for many years for television shows.  Like everything you ever hear on like the Brady bunch.  Yeah.  And,  uh,  that's that guy.  That's that guy.  He wrote all that music. 
[01:31:30]  And that's the guy they got to be the band for the show.  And they have people coming on.  You want to see a clip,  don't you?  Oh,  just see some of them.  Yeah.  We got to get someone in here to show a clip.  He'll come back in.  There's a great clip where a guy comes on and he's talking about,  he's trying to get rid of all of the racist,  um,  stuff from the twenties and thirties where they would have like,  you know,  black people caricatures and,  you know,  this is just really bad.  And you know what?  I'm just trying to get rid of it.  And then Fred Willard was like,  I know,  I mean,  except the guys with the big eyes,  those were funny.  They're like,  he's trying to keep like one thing that he likes. 
[01:32:00]  And again,  being so like,  again,  I totally agree with you.  But they would agree with him in a way that was so offensive.  Yes.  Which clip should we try to find?  Fernwood tonight.  Fernwood tonight.  Um,  there might even be the first episode.  I don't know.  Yeah.  God damn.  What a strange little show.  Yeah.  And,  and it's now like,  I went to a thing at the DGA where they had a reunion talking to him.  And people were saying,  would you ever bring that back? 
[01:32:30]  And Martin Mull's like,  how do we out parody stuff?  What's really out there?  How do we top it?  Like back then we,  we could seem crazy.  Now it would just seem.  Yeah.  Put,  put a Jew in there.  Yeah.  Put a Jew.  There you go.  Martin,  Martin Mull was like the host.  And,  uh,  Fred Willard was like a sidekick.  And just so cool.  Fred Willard is hilarious.  Yes.  Oh fuck.  Is he funny?  Best in show when he's doing the announcements of the dog show. 
[01:33:00]  It's just hilarious.  Where's the,  where's Dr.  Go up to the top there.  Try that one.  I'll find,  find these.  Sit down.  Thanks.  Happy.  Our next guest is an eminent anthropologist and sociologist from Southern Ohio University,  right here in Southern Ohio.  That's where you get the name.  Why waste time on a name?  That's what I say. 
[01:33:30]  He's been doing some studies on the causes of racial prejudice.  And,  uh,  probably about the best in the field.  Please welcome Dr.  Emmanuel Kaczynski.  Awful music.  It's terrible.  They play like this Jewish klezmer music to bring them out.  They talk about races.  How are you?  Welcome to the show.  Thank you kindly.  Well,  pretty lucky to have you here.  Uh,  doctor,  can you,  uh,  explain a little bit about your research?  Well,  Barth,  um,  America, 
[01:34:00]  as we all know,  is famous as a melting pot.  Uh,  many diverse ethnic groups have been thrown together.  Sure.  Uh,  suddenly,  and this leads to bigotry and name calling.  Uh,  the,  uh,  origins of,  uh,  various racial prejudices,  uh,  are what we are trying to,  uh,  put an end to and stop stereotyping once and for all.  There's probably,  uh,  too much of that,  more than we even need. 
[01:34:30]  That's up for grabs,  I think.  So you studied various nationalities,  just to find out,  um,  you know,  how people come,  become,  uh,  prejudiced against them.  Is that it?  Exactly.  Uh,  all,  all races are alike.  Uh,  we are all the same.  Does that,  uh,  does that apply,  uh,  like to the Dago also?  What I'm saying is,  you know,  to all,  yes,  I think,  all encompassing.  Well,  let us start with the Italians.  Uh,  the,  um,  after examining the bone structure of, 
[01:35:00]  uh,  the Italians and various other people,  we find the only differences between their bodies and the other races was in the,  uh,  knuckle and fist area.  Uh,  we found that the bones were developed broader and heavier and stronger,  and,  uh,  we found the musculature of the upper arm and shoulder,  uh,  was,  uh,  was,  uh,  much bigger and,  uh,  uh,  much better developed.  Uh,  the fists and arms of Italians are designed for hitting.  Uh,  Italians enjoy hitting. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah,  is this,  uh,  is this the only feature that really separates Italian from,  Italians from perfectly normal people?  I'd say that in a,  uh,  in a definite tendency towards overweight,  uh,  their,  um,  weight problem is probably,  uh,  a subconscious one,  but it is harder to dispose of a body in a car trunk or a barrel.  It's fat.  Now this is a,  uh,  recurring nightmare with many Italians and, 
[01:36:00]  uh,  it may explain all the hitting.  Absolutely.  In other words,  fists and a desire to hit and the large stomach and large body,  really large fists,  large body would be the main,  uh,  really the only differences between,  uh,  as I said before,  normal people and Italians.  Yes.  Uh,  and also their inability to learn English.  Uh,  tests show that Italian tongues are,  uh,  tongues are,  are thick.  At the back,  you see,  and this causes a strain on the throat muscles and gives them a definite tendency to speak in monosyllables and grunt a lot. 
[01:36:30]  I'll be done.  What did your,  uh,  study show about other groups?  Why zero in just on the,  uh,  well,  uh,  that's strange you should ask,  but,  uh,  we,  uh,  studied the electrocardiographs of our Jewish friends and,  uh,  tried to learn about the,  uh,  Jewish aversion to alcoholic beverages.  They don't drink a lot,  do they?  No,  Jewish people don't like to drink,  uh,  but we,  I'm afraid we'll have to pick up a tab.  I'm afraid we'll have to pick up a tab. 
[01:37:00]  I'm afraid we'll have to pick up a tab.  I'm afraid we'll have to pick up a tab.  Yeah.  I'm afraid we'll have to pick up a tab.  I'm afraid we'll have to pick up a tab.  That was very funny.  Yes.  Or Fresca.  I'm joking,  because we didn't have to.  And nothing against tab.  Yeah.  Uh,  well,  nothing against tab.  I was listening on the show earlier,  and I think we all came to know his type of people a little better,  and I think we're all a little richer for it,  too.  So what did you find?  Well,  uh,  all that's strictly toward one side.  Uh,  we discovered that,  uh,  when,  uh,  Jewish people are drinking, 
[01:37:30]  and the glass is half empty,  you see,  the rim of the glass comes to rest against the bridge of the nose,  and,  uh,  the magnitude of the nose acts as an obstacle to drinking and as a deterrent.  It's not so much they don't want to drink,  they simply can't drink.  Exactly.  The practical problem.  There's no mental or any religious or moral.  Okay.  Okay,  doctor.  But how about the Irish?  Now,  they're known as really big drinkers.  Now,  how would you explain that?  Well,  the Irish,  you see,  they,  they drink more because they have little tiny noses, 
[01:38:00]  and also they are totally insensitive to embarrassment.  How do Irish know?  They're good.  And I question,  why do they,  uh,  why do they,  uh,  wear green so much,  or does it just seem that way?  No,  that's a very good question.  You see,  the,  the Irish are basically a bunch of bog-trotting potato farmers.  Bog-trotting?  They see green grass,  and they figure,  why fight it? 
[01:38:30]  Just the opposite of the Italians,  of course,  would love to fight it.  At the drop of a pizza.  What other peoples have you studied?  What have you found?  Well,  the Chinese,  you see.  Amazing.  This is very fascinating,  because you see the skin of the Chinese,  and particularly in the area of the hands and the palms,  is highly water-resistant,  which gives Chinese people a much higher tolerance for doing laundry. 
[01:39:00]  Could you imagine trying to get this on today?  I understand that shortly after making that study,  you have to go back and re-study it again.  On this would be endless.  The internet would melt down if this was on.  Now,  wait a second,  what are you doing?  So make,  and again,  it's just.  What about,  uh,  what about Japs now?  Slays,  you are referring to the Japanese people.  Uh,  we studied them.  Uh,  we took a group of Japanese babies,  and, 
[01:39:30]  uh,  put a bush in their playpen.  Uh,  one by one,  they began pruning the bush.  Uh,  and,  uh,  several of them actually began trying to hide behind it.  Uh,  we also found that the Japanese enjoy the feel of leather and straps around the table.  on their necks,  which explains why they enjoy wearing cameras and binoculars. 
[01:40:00]  Well,  there's other little flight bags,  of course,  around the aisle.  Absolutely.  You see that everywhere.  I'm kind of curious.  What about,  let's say,  uh,  well,  I don't think we've touched on the Latin and Spanish people.  We've had an info to them lately.  Very good.  The,  uh,  well,  you see,  the Latin and the Spanish people exhibit a trait we call proximity desirability.  Now,  this is the need to be near others.  of their own kind.  Now,  uh,  we found that their houses are smaller,  but their families are bigger, 
[01:40:30]  you see,  and this may account for greater numbers of Latin people who live in,  say,  the same basement,  or ride all in the same old beat-up Chevy.  Doctor,  these are absolutely fascinating findings,  and I'm,  I'm curious,  I'm sure it's been a long time.  How long have you been involved in these studies here?  Oh,  uh,  almost six months.  Of course,  it would be the last three months being the heavy part.  The first part was getting the office together,  of course.  Um,  I guess the ultimate question I have to ask you, 
[01:41:00]  what nationality are you?  I am Polish.  I don't need to tell you,  I'm sure it's not news that a lot of people have,  uh,  told Polish jokes,  you know,  and,  uh,  I could tell you something right now,  and I,  but I'd have to tell them kind of slowly,  wouldn't I?  I don't understand that.  Okay.  The strafe-based deadpan.  Poland,  I was perfect.  I read the paper every day, 
[01:41:30]  I try to get international paper,  saw where a large hole appeared in Warsaw,  and they said the police were looking into it.  What did they find?  But,  uh,  seriously,  uh,  the Polish people have long been the brunt of some really,  cruel jokes,  I think,  and I just wonder,  what are your findings in that area?  Well,  uh,  I have done a,  a lot of studies on my people,  and,  uh,  all of our research indicates that  Polish people tend to be bright, 
[01:42:00]  perceptive,  and highly intelligent.  Well,  Dr. Kaczynski,  you certainly are a living testimony of the young people,  and I wish we could meet a couple more people like you.  In fact,  if we had three of you like you,  we could change this light bulb.  Here's what you're coming by,  and we'll be right back after this.  You can't work.  Oh,  shit,  that's great.  There we go.  Fernwood tonight.  Did they do blacks too?  Yeah,  I noticed that.  They didn't go with,  uh,  the blacks in that.  I think because it's so obvious to go with the black thing,  that they just went with every other one. 
[01:42:30]  Every,  yeah,  exactly.  Yeah.  But still,  that would,  again,  that would be constant.  We'd never play today.  Should we,  should we laugh at this?  Like,  is this,  right?  Oh my God,  now this is the,  why can't we,  I would demand Martin Moe apologize.  Who was the guy doing it?  That's just funny shit.  Um,  the guy,  it was Norman Lear and,  Oh,  the guy on the couch.  That,  I don't know,  he's a character actor that I've seen in a lot of stuff.  He had great timing.  Oh,  just dead, 
[01:43:00]  and you're like deadpan.  Their guests were always like that.  You never really knew who they were.  Yeah.  They were character actors.  They'd sit there and just be funny.  The deadpan is great.  You know,  you,  well,  yeah,  they had character actors or they had actors that now are huge,  but back then,  back then,  like Robin Williams would come on as different people.  And Jim Varney before he was,  uh,  right.  Ernest came on.  I see,  uh,  yeah.  What's his name there from Spinal Tap?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So yeah,  Harry Shearer,  all those guys kind of came on then. 
[01:43:30]  So you sort of saw the beginnings of that,  but it was like every night,  half an hour,  just,  I'm going to be in a Fernwood tonight.  I know.  Now,  yeah,  I'm going to get stuck on YouTube today.  It's some crazy stuff.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Pat,  what are you doing in town,  by the way?  You got the Webby Awards.  Yeah.  You're hosting that?  I'm hosting the Webby Awards again.  It's,  um,  it's,  it's awards for stuff on the internet.  Well,  yeah.  Where's it happening?  Uh,  that will be tonight at the,  hang on,  where, 
[01:44:00]  oh,  it's Cipriani Wall Street.  Ah.  The Cipriani Wall Street,  and it's,  um,  you know,  this is one of those things that started a few years ago.  They gave awards to things on the internet,  little films and,  and viral stuff,  and now it's gotten,  I mean,  the Academy Awards,  the first Academy Awards was just a,  basically a dinner in a restaurant.  Right.  You know,  um,  now it's,  it's the 25th anniversary of the internet,  of the Web.  She's 25 years old this year.  Wow.  So,  the people that are coming are like,  um,  I mean,  Charlie Rose is coming, 
[01:44:30]  uh,  Fred Armisen,  who's going to be,  um,  doing his Ian Rubbish character,  Patty Smith,  Natasha Lyonne,  George Takei,  and then,  Tim Berners-Lee,  who basically invented the internet.  Oh.  He's the guy who invented it,  and,  at the time,  could have patented it,  and said,  no,  this needs to be free for everybody.  Whoops.  Why are they patented?  Uh,  I just,  I don't think,  he wanted it to be an open-sourced,  anyone can share information.  Boy,  I bet he regrets that. 
[01:45:00]  He probably thought it would be a little thing  that people play solitaire on,  he didn't see networking.  As he's booking his flight to New York,  I bet you he's,  he's on orbit right now.  Any,  any cat videos on there?  Um,  I'm,  you know what?  The,  one of the memes of the year is something to do with a cat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure there's plenty,  oh,  come on.  Did you see my cat video over the weekend?  I'm,  Lil Beavis?  I didn't see it.  Go to O-P-A-N-T-X-M,  uh,  on,  on,  um,  You got a good cat video?  I got a good one.  Uh-oh.  This is a fucking good one.  And if you just hold out another 10 years, 
[01:45:30]  they will do an Irving Thalberg style award for you and your cat videos.  Go full screen,  sound up,  and watch this.  Do you get full penetration?  This is Lil Beavis and Lil Freddy.  Who's Lil Freddy, by the way?  Oh, my God.  It's a friend's cat.  Watch.  Watch this now.  See,  Lil,  Lil Freddy,  Hasslin Beavis.  Now watch.  Oh!  Oh!  Buddy!  Beavis!  Oh, he's,  Oh, he had it.  Beavis smacked his head on that fucking, 
[01:46:00]  Wow!  That would hurt so hard.  And I love how after he cracked his skull,  you see he walks over and Lil,  Freddy is still bugging him,  and he gives this look like,  no, we're done.  Yeah, yeah.  That hurt my head.  I just hit my head.  We're done.  That really hurt my head.  He spun around to chase him,  crashed head first into the table leg.  And like a cat,  you know,  they just kind of try to play it off like nothing happened.  You gotta change that title to Kitten Clocks His Head.  Yeah.  For the kitten people.  I know.  Because they don't know that your cat's being the Clocks His Head. 
[01:46:30]  You know what?  You do have to put the event in the title now,  like to make people go,  Oh, I'll watch that.  I'll watch that.  You can't just go,  OMG, so cute.  No.  No, no.  Give the event.  Let me know exactly what I'm going to see here.  Yeah.  I will say that people like sites like HuffPo and T-Bowms World,  they're really,  they've learned the old style carnival barker.  You will not believe what Jennifer Lawrence does.  And then she just says a bit funny.  It's nothing.  Every video is now, 
[01:47:00]  check out this dog and child.  You won't believe how it ends.  And you're like,  I believe it.  Like if a video of Christ returning appears.  Yes.  And they go,  Oh my God,  the Savior returns.  And we'll go,  I guess.  Let's see what else.  Let's see what else.  Because it'll be surrounded by,  you know,  this whale penis  will make you rip your eyes out.  I don't want to see this.  Look at this Jew carrying heavy wood.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This,  this crucifixion video is really intense. 
[01:47:30]  You will not believe what happens three days later.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Before you can watch it though,  there's a 30 second commercial about ED.  First comment.  Yawn.  Yeah.  Fake.  Dislikes.  Right.  Yawn.  Dislikes.  Whatever.  We got proof he's,  he lived.  He came back.  Eh.  It doesn't matter how amazing a video is,  it will always get dislikes.  Are there tickets still to the album for tonight?  Uh,  I,  I,  I'm assuming there might be,  but I mean,  it's pretty packed. 
[01:48:00]  It's,  it's,  it's,  it's,  it's,  you don't even really have to promote it.  That's,  that's just a good gig for you,  man.  This is a great,  are you kidding?  I'm,  I'm,  I'm bringing Patti Smith on stage.  I'm kind of shitting my pants about that.  That's a big deal for me.  That's a legendary right there.  Introduce Patti Smith.  That's Jesus.  Smith or Smythe?  Uh,  no,  Patti Smith sang with scandal for God's sake.  Opie.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I love Patti Smith.  Goodbye to you.  She was awesome.  Oh,  Opie.  Married to John McEnroe.  John McEnroe now.  What?  Yes.  Oh,  forever. 
[01:48:30]  Amazing.  For a long time.  So,  so he was,  so you're saying he's shooting at the walls of heartache.  Bang,  bang.  Yes,  he is.  Bang,  bang.  Somebody wrote that song and they had to fit in.  So we'll go shooting at the walls of heartache and we got two,  we got two notes here.  What do we fill it with?  Right,  right.  I don't know how to say bang,  bang.  Bang,  bang.  Are you sure?  No,  you're worried.  Leave the notes.  I don't know how to say bang,  bang.  Yeah.  I don't think Patti's going to say bang,  bang.  You might,  she might surprise you.  She'll say it.  She just might.  She might surprise you.  She might,  she might sing bang,  bang.  Bang, 
[01:49:00]  bang.  Again,  don't,  you're popping your bees a little bit.  Just go,  you know.  What a dumb thing to have to say.  Do you really like Patti Smith?  Yes.  How deep do you go?  All the way back to horses.  Give us a song right now as we go to break.  Turn us on to a new Patti Smith song.  Not the tried and trues.  No,  a new,  oh God.  Not new,  new.  I'm meaning a song that would obviously be something we probably haven't heard.  Well,  do,  okay,  do one of her,  God,  type in Patti Smith and then horses. 
[01:49:30]  Like I know because the night.  No,  I know,  which is what started as a Springsteen song.  Yeah.  He wrote that.  Very true.  I wonder if Roland knows that.  He probably does.  Oh,  do Redondo Beach.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  We're going to go to break with this.  We're going to continue with Patton Oswalt.  Patti Smith.  Yeah.  Redondo Beach.  Redondo Beach.  Wait a minute.  Is that?  What's going on?  Did Sammy pick something?  Late at noon. 
[01:50:00]  Dream the town.  You just had to quarrel.  Sent you away.  Yeah.  I was looking for you.  How you got it down.  Anthony Quinn.  Yeah.  Another dimension.  Well,  you never be.  This is a gorgeous sneer.  How old is this? 
[01:50:30]  This is from,  this is from First Out Horses.  Wow.  Yeah.  In the 80s?  Uh,  70s.  Late 70s.  Down in the ocean.  It was so dismal.  Women all standing in a shack on their faces.  Sad descriptions.  Oh,  I was looking for you.  Yeah.  And her memoir,  just kids is incredible.  About being young and broke in New York back in the 70s. 
[01:51:00]  Amazing.  What were some of her issues back then?  Well,  she was roommates with Robert Mapplethorpe and she wanted to be like a poet.  He wanted to be a photographer and they were so broke and they were living in what was now the fashionable Lower East Side.  And it was,  they were just living in a wasteland.  And they had to do a thing where if she wanted to get art supplies and they also wanted to get food,  they decided,  do we go buy grilled cheese sandwiches and shoplift the art supplies or buy the art supplies and shoplift the,  and do a,  a dine and dash. 
[01:51:30]  Those were like these two seminal artists were at a point where they're just going,  do we steal the food and buy the supplies?  Do we steal the supplies and buy the food?  Wow.  Like that's where they both came out of.  And it's just the,  just these really human,  amazing moments.  I don't know if I've convinced you guys.  No,  I like it.  I really do.  You must like,  uh,  Lucinda Williams.  Yes.  I love,  I love her voice.  Love her.  Her voice is amazing.  God damn it.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll let this play out.  More with Patton Oswalt. 
[01:52:00]  Looking for you.  How you got done?  Bigger mistake.  Still replied.  Over to my room.  Started to cry.  It was smaller than angel.  How you got done?  Gun.  Gun.  Gun.  Down by the ocean.  It was so dismal. 
[01:52:30]  I was just standing to shackle my face.  The horse pulled away in the curl of the tide.  It was you.  You'll never return.  Never return.  Never return.  In my arms.  Think you were gun,  gun.  Never return.  In my arms.  Think you were gun,  gun.  Gun,  gun.  Gun,  gun.

The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  And better than ever.  On Sirius XM.  Patton Oswalt in studio doing the Webby Awards tonight. 
[01:57:30]  Yep.  That's going to be great.  Celebrate the Internet.  Celebrate the Internet.  We're giving away a best ball sack video.  Best under ball sack video.  Oh.  Best outrage tweet.  Most offended.  Most offended person, yes.  There's actually some pretty amazing, I've got to say, I've seen a lot of the videos they're giving awards.  One of the good things about when I host Webby's is I see a lot of stuff that I wasn't looking at online because I'm usually looking at porn. 
[01:58:00]  And you're like, Jesus, people are, like the next generation of filmmakers and creators are coming out of, like, remember how they used to come out of music videos in the 80s or before that it was, you know, little short films and stuff?  Now it's people on the Internet.  Like, oh, that guy's going to be a huge director someday.  What are some of the videos you saw that you never saw on your own?  Well, there's a video that an ad agency made about, it's a pro-gay marriage video that is the most un-maudlin, like, realistic. 
[01:58:30]  Even if you're anti-gay marriage, it's so well done and actually makes such intelligent points.  Can we see this?  Yeah, I, what is the name of, it was a...  Robert's Wedding?  I mean, Sam Roberts, of course.  Jason Collins is, who's the guy that, the basketball player that came out?  Is it Jason Collins?  I think so.  He's introducing it and I, now I can't think of the name.  And then there's also, like, stuff from even websites like College Humor. 
[01:59:00]  There's this young filmmaker named Oren Brimmer that does short films for them who is, even though he's making funny parody videos, they're brilliant and they're really well done.  It's really interesting to see because a lot of people can use the same equipment, the same everything, and you watch one thing and it sucks and looks like shit and it's cheap.  And then you watch something else and it's cinematic, it sounds great, it's got a storyline to it, the camera moves look beautiful. 
[01:59:30]  And it's like giving someone a canvas and paint and brushes and saying, paint something brilliant.  Just because you have the equipment doesn't mean you could be brilliant.  Yeah, and then meanwhile, Jean-Michael Basquiat just had spray cans and was making art on walls.  And making amazing art.  Oh, they're giving an award to Banksy and there's rumors that he might be hiding, he's not going to show up, but he might be hidden in the audience somewhere or something. 
[02:00:00]  But Banksy, a guy that just sprayed on walls and created a whole new thing.  Brilliant.  And then there's also a kid, I don't know if he's getting an award, he should.  He's on Vine named King Bach, young black kid that makes these six-second Vines that are so fucking funny.  And give him a sketch show, he understands comedy in six seconds with his phone.  Give us a couple of these.  Best of King Bach.  Do best of King Bach Vines. 
[02:00:30]  Oh.  It's hard to do six seconds.  He just walked by himself in the door.  That's pretty good.  Hang on.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Yeah, we're done.  Thank you.  Hey, bass, be my friend.  Hey, what's your name?  Oh!  Hey, man, what's up?  Oh, that's fucked up.  So, does this make it?  We'd just like to see some magic.  Pick a con. 
[02:01:00]  Okay.  Any con.  Now remember I say con.  Keep memorizing.  Memorize.  Took his laptop and ran.  Stop his laptop.  What are you doing?  I thought you wanted the D.  Come here, let's go.  Selfie.  You gotta stop with the dunk face.  He snapped his neck.  Why'd he go?  He snapped his neck.  He didn't like the duck face.  Face ass.  Work face ass.  Face ass.  Mm-hmm.  You poo.  Come on face ass.  Where am I?  Would you like to play a game?  A game?  Raise this baby.  That ain't no game, nigga.  That's like me. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  Oh, come around, bitch.  I'm just trying my shoelace.  And put the flower back in the face.  And need some water.  Yes, I do.  God, God, God, God.  Man, no.  Where you from?  Oh, Christ.  Hey, man.  Hold me back.  Man, I got this little nigga.  Matrix.  What's up, nigga?  What's up?  What's up?  What the hell?  You choking?  I got you, bro.  They're very obviously.  They have to be fast.  I'm a dick, my nigga.  Who's there?  It's okay.  We're blind.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Me too. 
[02:02:00]  I'm blind too.  Let's start the show.  Let me tease.  Get off me.  My car, dirt.  I got you, bro.  Put a car wash.  Let's go.  Please, please, drop.  Hey, no punchbacks.  Oh, shit.  Nigga, you alright?  Hey, you alright?  That's lame, guys.  Alright, man.  You got that gas money?  No, I only got my car.  Oh, that's all good.  Nigga.  You want cash? 
[02:02:30]  My fault.  Yo, stop.  Yo, I love playing this game with Ramona.  Show him.  Crisscross.  Yeah.  Yeah, crisscross.  Yeah, crisscross.  I like her.  What do I do?  Girls like bad boys.  Got it.  Hey, Bass.  What up, bitch?  What a jerk.  Now we're just watching blind videos.  Sorry, this is terrible radio.  It's horrible radio.  It's very creative.  Very creative, yeah. 
[02:03:00]  And six seconds, too.  Jesus.  A phone and six seconds and just bam.  Yeah, he has, right?  Yeah.  He's good.  That's good.  Yeah, someone give him a show.  God damn it.  Where's he from?  He an LA guy?  I don't know where he's from.  Ting Bach.  But his shit's funny.  On YouTube.  A six-second show.  But again, like, this is any new medium, there's always the, oh, these kids making a goddamn  video.  Someone will always go, oh, I can do something actually cool with that.  Yeah, yeah, yep.  I don't, and Vine isn't really happening anymore because there's, most people can't do shit 
[02:03:30]  with six seconds.  No, no.  They just can't do shit with it.  Yeah.  It's pretty much turned into people like that that can do something and they get a shitload  of, uh...  The rest of his is full of shit.  But for the most part, yeah, people can't.  There's two other people on Vine.  I cannot, now, this is embarrassing.  There's a blonde-haired college kid.  He's a wrestler.  Greg Hughes?  Ooh.  I don't know.  Ooh.  College kid.  And then there's this girl, like, the D or something, I know what her name is, and  she's all, they're, oh, I'm a terrible advocate for these people, but they're also really, 
[02:04:00]  really funny.  I follow them on Twitter, I cannot think of their names right now, but they're great.  He has six and a half million Vine followers.  He does?  Six point five million.  Damn.  Whoa.  Million.  Well, King Bach, way to go, buddy.  And no one knew him before, that's what's amazing.  And now he's about to get the O&A bump.  Damn.  Yeah, 5.2 he's going to have.  Ooh, the O&A bump, I like that.  The O&A bump.  Yes, it's usually under the cock crown. 
[02:04:30]  Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  Under the cock crown.  That's great.  You guys really are about to go on vacation.  You guys could not be.  We're like, well, I have a plug.  It's a big moment.  You do.  Here we go.  I have two plugs.  One is Tuesday night, I think, I'm doing this thing with Rich Voss and his lovely wife.  Oh, right.  More night.  I have sex with her in front of him.  He does his jokes. 
[02:05:00]  No, we're doing the live podcast at the Village Underground.  They have a great podcast, by the way.  Oh, my God.  It's really funny.  I think they have a cool marriage.  They have a very cool marriage.  They just both have great senses of humor about each other.  They're both brutal to each other, and neither one of them gets upset about it.  The thing that she did, she did a great pro-gay marriage video about with Voss saying, not  only am I, my friends were saying, I'm not going to get married until my gay friends get  married.  Well, I'm not going to divorce my husband until gay people are allowed to get married 
[02:05:30]  and get divorced.  She goes, and let me tell you what I'm deciding to stay with, and she shows you the picture  of Voss.  I'm going to stay married to this horror show where I could easily divorce him for probably  a good chunk of money, but that's how committed I am to gay friends.  I'm going to stay married to this idiot who's really funny.  Yeah.  They're great together.  That podcast has been really fucking funny.  Rich Voss is my, I think I told you guys the story that when I was working at the Winchester's 
[02:06:00]  pub in Baltimore for the Garvin's comedy, you ever worked for Garvin's back in the day?  I might have done an open mic for them in D.C. or something, but I never worked for Baltimore.  Yeah.  Well, Baltimore and D.C., they had a club in D.C.  They opened this place at the Winchester's Pub, and their manager was this gay guy named  Terry, and Terry loved tormenting the comedian, especially the young guys that were really  nervous, like me, like I'm nervous, I want to do a good job, I don't want him to send  back a bad report to the guys who run Garvin's, Harry Monacruces and stuff. 
[02:06:30]  So that night, I was doing the Winchester's Pub, and then the next night, I had to go up  to Philadelphia, drive to Philadelphia, like after the show, but super late, and I've done  two shows, and I'm waiting to get my money, and I'm like, hey, Terry, I have to drive  to Philadelphia, so could I maybe get my money?  Because I also, if I didn't get that money, I didn't have enough gas in my car to make  it to Philadelphia, so I had to get the money, and it's $75, like it's nothing, and Terry's  like, well, I don't know, maybe I still got to do stuff at the bar, so maybe you should 
[02:07:00]  just wait, and I'm like, well, it's 1.30 in the morning, and gosh, I worked a job all  day at this law firm, so I've been up since 6 a.m., and I would really love not to fall  asleep in the car, so I could just have my money and then drive, it's quite a long drive,  Terry, well, I guess maybe you should just drink some coffee, or maybe wait, like, he's  just fucking with me, like, just because he can, so then I'm, and I don't, I don't know  what to say, and I'm, you know, I'm such a pussy, so I go downstairs, because Rich Ross 
[02:07:30]  was the headliner, and he's still hanging around downstairs, and I go downstairs, and  I'm really, like, almost in tears, like, I don't know what to do, and Rich is like, what's  your, what's your fucking problem, and I go, well, you know, I need to drive to Philly,  and I don't have my money, and I, he won't give it to me, and he's, and, and, and  Rich just goes, goddammit, and he just stomps up, he goes, hey, torch song, give the kid  his fucking money, come on, and, like, just starts screaming at him, and just, sorry,  sorry, and just, like, gives me my money, and I, so it's like, fuck yeah, Rich, and Rich  bailed you out, good for Rich, but he was, what a dick, though, yeah, it's like, just me, 
[02:08:00]  just because he could, it was only because he could, there's nothing to gain from it, just  like, I can watch this young guy be nervous, yeah, I'm just gonna do it, and then, then  Rich just goes stomping upstairs, what a little, yo, yo, tort song, give the kid his  money, what were you doing for a law firm, uh, I was clerking, did you want to, were  you, you didn't pass the bar at that point, no, no, no, god, no, I was, I was studying  to be a paralegal, just because there would be good money in it, but it was that thing 
[02:08:30]  where I was up at 6 a.m., had to be in the law firm at 8, I would get off at 5, I would  take, like, a bathroom shower, get freshened up, and then go drive into the city,  get some cheap Chinese food, and do the clubs.  Where was the law firm?  Uh, it was in Vienna, Virginia.  And I remember, uh, for lunch break, I would go in to the bathroom, take a giant, I would  unroll all this fucking toilet paper, so I had a big wad, I would put it on that metal  thing on the back of the toilet, and sit backwards on the toilet, and take a one-hour nap on my 
[02:09:00]  toilet paper pillow, that was so exhausted.  Toilet paper pillow on the toilet tank.  I was operating on, like, four hours sleep a night, because I was doing this stuff, and  I was just determined to, so I was so exhausted.  That's fucking smart, though.  Yeah.  Why not go, yeah, beach going out to the car.  Yeah.  Well, unfortunately, we had to park in this lot where, when you go out to your car, it  was just this oven.  You know, it was either an oven in the summer, or an icebox in the winter, so I would just  sit in there and...  Toilet.  Toilet nap. 
[02:09:30]  That's the best.  Take a little toilet nap.  You must be a good sleeper.  I was a horrible sleeper, but I would just do anything to get even...  When I say an hour's sleep, I probably got actual 15 minutes of sleep, and then, you  know, 45 minutes of shifting around, people on either side of me, you know, just starting  this thing.  Did you have to look, did it take you a while to figure out how to sleep in there?  Oh, yeah.  Did you try forward on the toilet, and you're like, this ain't working?  No, no, I needed some neck support.  It was a nightmare.  Like, I could see going, if I spin around, I could rest my head on the tank thing, or 
[02:10:00]  the little metal thing, but...  Oh, my gosh.  Maybe I could kneel.  Maybe I could kneel.  I need something soft.  Toilet paper is soft.  I'll put the whole roll there.  No, this don't work.  Let me...  I bet there were a couple days where it was just my forearm, but then the metal thing  would indent on the other side, so that hurts.  A big bolt mark on your fucking arm.  I was like, well, that didn't work.  Oh, you know what?  Hey, there's toilet paper here.  Oh, my use.  So I would make a toilet paper pillow.  Oh, that'd be a good name for a memoir.  Toilet paper pillow.  How much would you hate when you were just about to doze off, and you heard the telltale 
[02:10:30]  sound of a belt being loosened?  And a huge sigh of relief, like...  And it was in the same stall.  Did you move over?  Did they ever kick you out?  Did they ever get caught?  No, because it was when most of the office would clear out.  Yeah.  And, you know, because I was doing...  I was indexing testimony all morning, so it was just this...  Oh, my God.  So try to imagine you're working on three hours sleep, bad coffee, like a couple Pop-Tarts, 
[02:11:00]  and then that caffeine...  You get the caffeine spike, and then the crash hits, and you are reading through, you know,  this, well, when I signed on to the construction project, and I've got to, you know, index every...  It was just a nightmare.  Before computer referencing, right?  Exactly.  It was a way to do it all by hand.  Wow, yeah.  To give to the attorneys so that they could go through, and it was...  Oh, man.  That must have been odd for somebody coming in and looking under the stall and seeing  the feet facing the wrong way. 
[02:11:30]  Wow.  Like, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?  Yeah.  He's doing a reverse cowgirl dump.  He's doing a reverse cowgirl dump.  Woo!  Well, how awful if it's your law case, your case, and you're like, where's the guy indexing?  He's sleeping on the septic tank.  Let me go wake up.  With his toilet paper pillow.  Right.  Yeah, that was a nightmare.  He's got his face in an upper decker.  Yes, exactly.  For vacation, he comes in and he lounges in the urinal.  But there was like...  I cannot tell you how relieved I was where the one year... 
[02:12:00]  I think after four years of doing stand-up, I made $11,000 in one year.  And it was just enough for me to not have a day job.  I could live at poverty level just doing stand-up.  Right.  And I felt like, I'm a fucking king.  I'm a king.  Now?  I can barely pay my rent.  I can buy a giant bag of rice, a bunch of cans of beans.  Yep.  And then I can go to a place with free coffee refills and eat for free at the comedy club at night.  Good.  I got my life set. 
[02:12:30]  I'm a comic now.  I'm perfect.  And I'm pulling in $11,000 a year in $19.91.  So I'm feeling pretty good.  Living live, my son.  Absolutely living live.  Oh, yeah.  11 Gs.  Could not believe it.  Like, I'm like, I broke double digits.  Wow.  I made 11 Gs, man.  I could not have been happier.  Holy shit.  I don't go into that fucking law firm in my shitty suit.  With my...  I had five ties, two white shirts, and I would just rotate them.  Because I had no clothing. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, fuck.  How did you get your suit cleaned?  Like, that's expensive, right?  Thank God I didn't have to wear a suit.  I could get them with a button-up shirt and a tie and then slacks.  I didn't have to wear a jacket.  What about laundry?  Laundry, I knew a place.  I would sleep.  I would put...  I had two pairs of slacks.  And the day that I wasn't wearing one of them, I would put it under my mattress to really make the crease sharp.  Yeah, yeah.  To make it look like it was okay.  And hopefully no food stains got on it.  It was just...  Oh!  Isn't it? 
[02:13:30]  Doesn't it fucking creep you out?  And I would go to a drugstore and I would get one of those five packs of white t-shirts.  And, you know, the pit stains got so...  I would just toss them and buy a new pack every week.  Do you remember the last day there?  Your last day and how you felt?  God, you know what?  No, because what I remember more was making like...  Oh, I'm at the point where I'm making $3.50 a week as an emcee sometimes feature.  So that was...  I was celebrating that more than I was like, fuck! 
[02:14:00]  Right, right.  Law firm, so...  Colin last year in his...  He did a keynote speech and he talked about, like, regrets.  And one of his regrets, he said, was that at one point making money doing comedy would have been everything.  And he said, I kind of...  I regret that I lost the joy in that or the feeling of amazement that I'm actually making a living doing this.  And as you're talking about pressing your pants, I'm like, it's...  Can you imagine at that point if you would have said, X amount of years later, I'll have this much money, I'll be doing this, and there will still be complaints.  Yeah, I'll still be whining about stuff. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, before all of us, you know, you think, like, wow, what the fuck am I complaining about?  Yeah, yeah.  But, I mean, those memories, for some reason, are still fresh in my head, so there's a lot of stuff that I kind of...  There's, trust me, there's stuff I complain about, but the fact that I get to make money doing stand-up, everything else is a fuck...  It's just gravy.  To have worked for a living and worked at something you fucking hated...  Hated.  It really does give you a great appreciation for where you are.  Actually, you know what was even worse for me?  It wasn't that I had a job I hated. 
[02:15:00]  That would have been one thing, like a job that I...  Because hatred would have still been an emotion.  I had a job that I was so absolutely indifferent, it meant nothing to me.  And I was making okay money.  I made...  By the way, when I got 11 grand a year and then just decided to be a stand-up, I took a huge pay drop when I left the law firm.  But it was the fact that if that job had gone away, I would have only missed the money.  I wouldn't have been like, you know, oh, well, fuck that...  I had zero feelings about it. 
[02:15:30]  And to spend like...  It's eight hours a day for something that I feel nothing about.  Yeah, yeah.  You want to be a lawyer?  Absolute numbness.  No, I never wanted to be a lawyer.  It seems like such a waste when you're there doing it and it's just for the money.  And there were people in the law...  There were a couple of lawyers in the law firm that really, truly loved the law.  And they were passionate.  And you could tell they were happy to come in.  Yep.  And there were a couple, and I won't name them, that they were just like...  It was clearly that their parents had made them do it or they just were like, well, it'll be this much money, so I'll have that money. 
[02:16:00]  And they...  Yeah.  Again, they didn't even hate being lawyers.  They didn't care either way.  Oh, no.  And so I was like...  By the way, I know a couple of pretty big-name actors and big-name comedians that are totally indifferent about what they do.  Just telling you.  I'm like, why are you doing it?  It's there.  Well, were they kind of shitty lawyers who, like, you know, I don't want to say their names, you know, Darden, Clark?  I ran into...  God, who was the guy?  And he died.  He was on O.J.'s team.  Johnny Cochran.  Not Johnny Cochran. 
[02:16:30]  The white dude.  Kardashian.  Oh, yeah.  I was at some function this year ago when Kardashian was there.  And I wasn't talking to him, but I heard someone talking to him.  And they were saying, hey, I saw Marsha Clark, like, at some other big-name case.  And he was like, oh, was she watching how an actual real lawyer does it?  Or something like that.  Because however you feel about O.J., the prosecution team was so horrible.  They stunk.  Yeah, they were really bad.  We all knew how bad they were.  We had no experience. 
[02:17:00]  One of those guys at the Comedy Cellar one night, Bill Hodgman, I think he was originally the guy assigned to it.  And then they, first of all, they probably did it because they wanted a white woman, not a white man to prosecute him.  Right, right.  But he had health issues.  Oh.  So me and Godfrey talked to him downstairs, and we took pictures with him.  And I got him to sign something, and he wrote, Dear Jim, he did it.  And he signed his name.  Wow.  That was his autograph.  Wow.  It was a very funny autograph.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, yeah, like that, just seeing people. 
[02:17:30]  Look, doing something that you hate for no money, that's one thing.  Like, you're doing it because you're starting out.  Right.  But when you see someone that they are wealthy doing something that they hate or are indifferent to, that's just a tragic, tragic waste of your life.  You've got to just really be miserable.  Yeah, like, just don't do it.  At that point.  You can do other things.  There's way more money other places.  Damn, yeah.  Way less aggravation.  I forgot who said that saying that there's a lot of accountants that should actually be ballerinas. 
[02:18:00]  There's also a lot of ballerinas who should be accountants, and they'd be way happier.  Both ways.  It cuts both ways.  Yeah.  Sometimes you've got to wonder, why am I unhappy?  Is it because I'm the type of person that once I'm comfortable, nothing is good enough anymore?  Right.  I always have to change.  Is it a personality flaw and not the job?  Or do you suspect that the happiness will go away because you have experience with, I've had highs that have been crashed, so then I've been conditioned not to trust joy or to be wary of it going away? 
[02:18:30]  I don't know.  Your job is such a big part of your life.  Oh, yeah.  Like, it's your daily fucking thing that you have to do, and if you're miserable doing it, it's going to fuck up the rest of your life.  Yeah.  There's no way you can just leave your shit job that you're miserable with and then just, all right, well, I leave that at the office.  Right.  Or when I come home, there's going to be problems.  It's amazing that we've kind of, you know, got that ball and chain of a job around your ankle like that. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  I carry it everywhere, though.  I just, everywhere I go, I'm just bringing laughter.  You are.  You bring joy.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  You don't walk, you cartwheel.  Cartwheel everywhere.  Here comes Jim.  Yeah, here he comes.  Oh, my God.  Where are all these animated birds coming?  Oh, it's Jim.  Jim's coming.  There's a little ray of sunshine coming through the clouds.  I never understood the people that were completely content in those jobs, too, because when I was working in the construction industry, air conditioning and heating industry, all I wanted to do was get out of it. 
[02:19:30]  But there were people there that, and I was always doing something to try to get out of it, you know, some type of creative thing, something.  Yeah.  And there were guys that were just, that was their job.  They knew they were never going to leave it, had no aspirations to leave.  Yeah.  So it's like, what the fuck do you want to do this for?  Well, plus they've got to pay their bills.  Yeah, yeah.  But you also have to understand, there are some people, and it's hard for, because there's people, it's hard for them to understand how we can do what we do. 
[02:20:00]  There are some people that putting in an air conditioning system and doing it right, that is art to them.  They get real satisfaction, and that's a big deal for them, or building a wall, like laying bricks perfectly.  Yeah, yeah.  That is a gorgeous thing for them.  That wall, that's mine.  That's mine.  I did that.  I did that.  Yeah.  There's something kind of nice about that.  Now drive against it at fucking 80, would you please?  Don't you drive up and down the LIE saying, hey, I did that building. 
[02:20:30]  God damn it.  I have.  I've seen them.  I know.  Top I landed those.  Well, there's some.  But try to go in that building now and visit your work.  Yeah, sure.  They'll have you removed.  Somewhere there are printed case histories that I helped index.  There you go.  In a law firm library somewhere, there's my handiwork.  Yes.  A bunch of men being released who shouldn't.  Yeah.  I did something in West Memphis years ago about these.  I just remember writing.  Yeah, I just remember.  I just wrote heavy metal slash guilty. 
[02:21:00]  Guilty.  Guilty.  Devil guilty.  Yeah, black t-shirt, dead.  Yeah.  Guilty.  Alfred something.  I don't remember what it was.  The worst law clerk in history.  I liked the law, though.  I wanted to be a lawyer in high school.  Did you really?  Really?  My original goal was, but it was more of a performance desire, like Pacino and Injustice  for All.  It was that moment in front of the jury shit where you're like, not the other shit.  But really, I mean, I can think of a bunch of comedians.  Bill Burr comes to mind immediately, who would probably be an amazing litigator for arguing 
[02:21:30]  a point and swaying.  That's true.  He's got to sway.  Bill's good.  Bill Burr has to sway a theater full of drunks.  Now, if he's got 12 sober people in a box, he could annihilate them.  Yeah, that's true.  But Bill has too bad of a temper.  Yeah, he would.  Bill's fucking Boston childhood rage would come out.  That's what he said.  He's a psychopath.  Very good.  No, no, people.  You're no better.  Fuck him.  Put him in prison.  I don't care. 
[02:22:00]  Bullshit, you just said.  Bullshit.  Read it back.  Read it back.  You're out of your fucking mind.  That laugh he does.  Whatever those Bill Burr's laugh is.  But picture that laugh, followed by bloody child's underpants.  I guess he would be terrible at it, after all.  He's smart enough to do it, though.  He's a good enough debater.  Yeah, yeah, he would.  I mean, that's one of the reasons I did debate in forensics in high school.  And anyone that I, whenever a teenager is like, hey, I want to be a comedian, like, 
[02:22:30]  go tomorrow for free.  You can get stand-up training for free in your high school.  Go do forensics and debate.  What's forensics and debate?  Debate is, you know, forensics is public speaking.  You either do an interpretation of a speech.  I would do Monty Python routines for a humorous interpretation, dramatic and humorous interpretation.  But then with debate, you would do extemporaneous debate, which is where, with no preparation,  they just go, like, they would just go, you're pro-abortion, you're anti, you've got five minutes,  you're about to go argue it. 
[02:23:00]  And you're like, oh, shit.  And then you've got to form your arguments quickly.  And the best way to win an extemporaneous debate is to crack jokes and crack the other  side up.  And so you learn very quickly to disarm people that way.  And you also, when I was doing humorous interpretation, I read Monty Python's The Bookshop Sketch.  And you really learn, because you've got to write it out to memorize it.  And you learn how to write, oh, that's how you land a joke.  That's what it looks like on paper.  That's paper, yeah.  So all that, if there's any high schoolers listening that want to be a comedian, you've 
[02:23:30]  got free training for four years if you take it.  Fuck that.  I'll just, like, go up there.  I'm funny.  I'm funny.  My friends fucking laugh.  Fuck that shit.  I remember I was in a room full of mafioso, and I swayed them with a laugh.  I said, after all, we are not lawyers.  And they all laughed.  Nice.  Very good.  Good save.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Are our phones here?  Phone guy here yet?  Uh-oh.  We're getting free Samsungs. 
[02:24:00]  Free phones.  What?  Yeah.  We're part of the white glove.  Hello.  You're bailing on the free phone today.  Yeah, I've got to get home real quick.  Unfortunately, I have to leave soon, too, because I have to go rehearse the Webbys.  Oh!  We have rehearsal today, blocking and rehearsal and going over my crazy monologue.  It's going to be...

We'll see you next time.  Yes, sir.  Again, you know, when I come back into town, I will call away ahead of time.  Yes.  Yes.  No, it's all good.  You saved us today.  Tweet rolling till...

Wrapping up everything that went down on today's O.P. and Anthony show.  How great was Patton Oswalt?  So cool to have guys like that that are not only amazing guests, but they're fans of the show.  Like, he's coming in and talking about what has been happening on the show recently that he has been enjoying. 
[02:36:30]  It's a rare thing for a guest to be that good and to be that big of a fan.  I mean, you hear some of the callers that call in.  The callers are all big fans of the show.  But a lot of them are not good guests.  Not whatsoever.  A lot of them are very, very bad.  For Patton Oswalt to be this big a fan and to be this good a guest is an amazing thing.  We got to revisit Spaz for a little while today.  Told some wrestling jokes about Vince McMahon losing money. 
[02:37:00]  Of course.  All about the Billboard Music Awards.  DJ Who Kid just stopped in.  Hell yeah.  You excited about Michael Jackson hologram?  Hell yeah.  You are, right?  Now, you met Michael Jackson.  Hell yeah.  Did that hologram look like Michael Jackson to you?  Hell no.  It didn't, right?  You didn't think so.  Like, some people were calling in today, one guy, and he said that the hologram was a video  of a Michael Jackson impersonator.  Yeah, I had a feeling it was that, too. 
[02:37:30]  But don't you think that the, I mean, it's not like the hologram is just a video being  projected onto the stage.  Don't you think it's like a video game character where it's not actually a photo of Michael Jackson?  It's like a digital tribute.  It's a digital tribute.  Yeah, there's nothing crazy.  Like when a girl shoves a finger inside of you.  A digital tribute.  I mean, yeah.  Digits.  Digital.  I mean, when the Tupac thing came out, everybody was shocked because...  But that didn't really look that much like Tupac either. 
[02:38:00]  But the Tupac, I mean, the hologram was dancing with Snoop Dogg.  It humped.  It was a little much.  You didn't see when it humped?  It humped.  It did it?  Yeah, this one was more like a tribute.  Well, it was moonwalking, but I didn't know we had the technology to make holograms hump.  Hell yeah.  Wow.  Dr. Dre got it somehow.  I don't know.  Well, if anybody's going to get it.  Tupac humped.  That's all I know.  If anybody's going to get it.  Let's find out what today's line of the day was.  We have Patton Oswalt in studio today.  Oh, that's hot.  This is a very funny show.  Let's find out what the line of the day was. 
[02:38:30]  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  And this guy looks, this guy looks, you know, almost like Michael Jackson.  So why wouldn't you go, okay, what, what do I need on my face to like bring him home?  Right, really.  A child.  Because they're almost, you like that one, a child on his face. 
[02:39:00]  That was funny.  Did you watch last night?  I saw a little bit of it.  What did you think?  It's like seeing the same performances over and over for some reason.  No, you're right.  It's the same people.  Rappers, same people.  Yeah, Miley Cyrus is going to do something outrageous.  Tongue out and all that.  Lorde is going to, everybody's going to be like, wow, she can really sing.  I'm just mad I miss Ratatouille.  I should have came a little earlier.  Is that why you like Patton Oswalt?  I interviewed him for Matt Wright.  That's my favorite cartoon of all time. 
[02:39:30]  Ratatouille is?  Yeah.  Why?  I fucked a bitch to that shit.  You had sex with a woman while watching Ratatouille.  That's how much you like the movie.  I like the, I don't know.  I like cartoons and sex.  Well, I read in the New York Times that you go to sleep eating Frosted Flakes.  Hell yeah.  And then you have sex watching cartoons.  Yeah.  What's it?  What's it?  So is Ratatouille, is it your favorite cartoon to enjoy or do you find that to be the most  sexual?  I like it when, cause you know, Ratatouille is like a gooey like snack. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, okay.  It's sexual too.  A lot of people don't know that Ratatouille is used during Arab sexual acts.  I had no idea.  Is that true?  I go to Dubai a lot.  That's how I know these things.  Do they, do they fuck desserts?  No, they just put it on themselves.  Oh, okay.  So they just start rubbing Ratatouille on themselves.  That's why the connection with Michael Jackson works so well.  Cause when I, when I met Michael Jackson, he had a little bit of Ratatouille on his chest.  Really?  And that must've been from?  In Bahrain.  Yeah, from the Arabs.  From some sexual acts.  He probably did, but uh.  Now do you think he was inviting you? 
[02:40:30]  The fact that he had Ratatouille on his chest?  Maybe he was inviting you to maybe.  I don't think so.  You don't think so?  You didn't get that vibe from him?  You had a little laugh on him, a little giggle.  He cursed, right?  Yeah, he cursed too.  That was crazy.  That is, sounds crazy.  Cause I was, I was letting him know that they were about to confiscate or they were about  to take his, uh, Neverland.  Like, fuck that shit, man.  I don't care about that shit, yo.  He dropped the N-word at all?  Uh, nah.  He didn't.  Ah, that's too bad.  Would you have flipped out if you had heard Michael Jackson using the N-word?  Uh, I wouldn't be surprised, but he, he lost his niggerism like 20 years ago.  Oh, so Michael can't even use, he can't use the word anymore. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, he's white.  So he'd be offended.  No, I would be offended.  You would be.  Cause he's white.  Right.  And you're white.  And that's how white Michael Jackson is.  He's, he's whiter than you.  That's crazy.  Well, now he's, he's not any kind.  Now he's just, he's whiter than me because he's just bone, rotting away.  He's a little beige right now.  And everybody's talking about the hologram tribute as if it's the first time it's been  done.  Like, nobody's being like, yeah.  Like, everybody's like, wow, wasn't it a little creepy to see a dead guy hologram on stage?  And it's like, we just. 
[02:41:30]  There's so many holograms out there that people are like, they, they did the biggie one.  They did a biggie hologram?  I think they did a biggie one there.  There's like even a lot, there's a lot of dead ones.  There's, I mean, cause we saw the Tupac one like two summers ago and nobody's being like,  yeah, we saw the hologram.  We know it's possible.  I mean, I cried a little bit, you know, tear went.  At the Tupac one?  Yeah.  Cause the tear went down my cheek.  Then I sniffed it back in my nose.  Why?  Just getting all the juices going together?  It's crazy.  So were you crying when he was humping?  I laughed at that part.  You laughed at that part.  But when he danced with Snoop, I was, I was kind of amped up. 
[02:42:00]  It was emotional.  The Michael Jackson one was not as emotional?  Nah, because I met him and then he had Ratatouille on it.  You're like, it's all good.  Pat Oswald.  I wanted to let Pat Oswald know that experience.  I always thought Ratatouille was just a rat.  I didn't know anything about the dessert.  That was, no, it's a, it's a, it's like a little, a gluttony snack.  What other cartoons do you watch?  Uh, you don't want to know.  No, I guess I don't.  Charlotte's Web.  When you have sex, you watch Charlotte's Web?  That's like an emotional story of like, it's like a tearjerker, isn't it? 
[02:42:30]  When you have a pig and a spider, it's just like, it's crazy.  Oh, it feels very sexual.  You're saying it was more than meets the eye with that pig and that spider.  Cause they, it looked like they wanted to fuck, but you know, but they had that love  against, you know, the, the, the, the sizes is why they didn't fuck.  Right.  Because obviously, uh, the pig would have hits, would have hit Charlotte from the back.  I don't think you would have hit him at all.  But if he had done that, then the spider would have died.  Charlotte would have been crushed.  I mean, it relates to me.  Cause you know, my dick is big and the pussies are usually small. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, it's a very, they're scared of you.  It's like a Charlotte's Web.  Intimidated.  Episode every time.  And also you'll shoot a web with your dick and you'll write your name or whatever.  You'll write a little message.  Spider dick.  Spider dick.  That's right here.  That's what they call you.  That's incredible.  Uh, Sal.  Yeah, Sam.  Do you have a favorite clip from today?  Uh, yeah, I do.  Uh, Sam, one thing really quick.  Ratatouille is not a dessert.  What?  It's not.  What is it?  It's like a soup.  It's a vegetable dish with like a broth.  Is it gooey?  Hell yeah. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, I mean, cause it's like the, the vegetables are kind of gooey.  You can put your dick in it.  Yeah, but.  But could you see yourself spreading it all over yourself in the middle of a sex act?  Absolutely not.  No.  Okay.  So who can make, maybe out of his mind?  You don't like the taste of garlic and salt?  I mean, I guess I do, but not in, not in the sex as well.  Like that's dinner.  Your girl likes it too, right?  Your girl likes garlic and salt, right?  Well, sure.  Everybody likes garlic and salt.  It's a great seasoning.  If you put it on your chest, your wife wouldn't lick it?  Like.  I don't know.  I don't know for sure.  I don't know if garlic and salt is what you would like.  I mean, maybe something sweet, like some chocolate syrup or something. 
[02:44:00]  I was, well, a voice turns me on, man.  It does.  It does.  It's just something, it's associative.  No homo, though, but you know.  No, I understand.  It's associative is all that is.  How do you know so much about French culture, Sal?  Because I like French food.  I mean, you just, that's like the most quintessential French dish.  Yeah, but you know what it sounds like when you say, I like French food?  Yeah.  It sounds like French food is code word for dick.  No.  That's what, doesn't it?  And I saw, I actually really like that movie.  That movie is fucking awesome. 
[02:44:30]  I read that too.  And he makes it in the movie, yeah.  La femme, c'est bon.  Is that you calling yourself a femme?  No, I said the movie was great.  Oh, I thought you were just calling him a femme.  No, no, no, French nigga.  Look at that, it's really good.  It's because he's Haitian.  He's not impersonating.  He's not worldly.  He's Haitian.  Nigga, I'm French, nigga.  Let's go to Big D in Kentucky.  What's up, Big D?  Hey, Sam.  How are you doing, buddy?  I was doing okay.  Now I'm a little confused. 
[02:45:00]  Well, you know, Sal was out there with the, you know, I called before about Sal being  out there with Fez and the camping trip and whatnot.  Right, right.  You remember that?  You remember Sal's camping trip, right, Hoekid?  I love that bonfire or whatever the hell is next to it.  All dudes.  Sal just likes eating that ratatouille that makes you think Fez is fucking semen, man.  Oh, is that wall?  It's off his chin, down his...  Why don't you fucking stutter a little more through a fucking French lady, you dumb fucking  hick?  Is it a semen thing?  No, it has nothing to do with that. 
[02:45:30]  It's just food.  God forbid someone says they like anything around here.  It's, oh, he's a dick.  You know more.  Sal, don't lie.  You know you like a big cock in your ass and your mouth and you like dribble.  Why don't you just go fuck your cousin, you stupid fucking hick?  Why would I, why would I, why would I do that?  Why would I, go shut the fuck up.  Why don't you go cook some fucking fried chicken with lard, you piece of shit, uncultured  fucking loser?  If you can't handle the heat, stay the fuck out of the ratatouille.  Oh, ratatouille.  What the fuck are you saying? 
[02:46:00]  You're so uncultured and stupid, you piece of shit.  Hey, at least we fuck our sisters where I live at.  Right, exactly.  Sal.  Fucking piece of garbage.  Why do the fans of this show hate Sal?  I really cannot understand this shit right now.  Sal sounds like Andy Kaufman cutting a wrestling promo in the 70s in the South.  This right here is called soap.  You can wash with it and get that odor away.  Savant.  That's soap in French, nigga. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, okay.  How do you say the N-word in French?  Benigla.  That sounds very annoying.  No, it's neg.  It's neg, right?  I know the slang term, they call black people, they call them baboons.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah, baboon.  Baboon.  Yeah.  That's what they call black people in Paris?  I don't mind you calling me that.  I would never do that to you, Hukit.  I feel like it'd be disrespectful.  I mean, you know, if I fuck your wife, you call me a baboon.  Please don't fuck my wife to find out.  I won't fuck your wife, man.  She's a nice person.  That's what I'm saying, but I don't know why you didn't even bring that up. 
[02:47:00]  I'm just giving you an example why that word comes up.  Oh.  Oh, like if you gave me a reason to be mad at you.  Baboon.  Then I'd call you baboon and you'd be like, okay, I understand.  But you would say baboon.  Baboon.  And you'd be like, well, I did fuck his wife.  I understand.  Gotta give him that one.  Gotta give him that one.  I would never fuck your wife.  She's so nice, yo.  Thank you.  Yeah, she has a nice face.  What does that mean?  I mean, she has a nice face, man.  Wait, I don't understand what that means.  I've seen the way you behave around people.  I don't understand what that leads to.  Don't look at your wife like that, bitch. 
[02:47:30]  I'm just saying, but you said that nice face is like, you know, you can tell people deep  throat, nice face.  She's not in the cartoons.  She's not in the rat tattoo.  Okay, so you don't want to watch cartoons.  No Pan Oswald with her.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, Sal, let's hear your clip real quick.  It was that thing where I was up at 6 a.m., had to be in the law firm at 8.  I would get off at 5.  I would take like a bathroom shower, get freshened up, and then go drive into the city, get some  cheap Chinese food, and do the clubs.  Where was the law firm?  It was in Vienna, Virginia. 
[02:48:00]  And I remember for lunch break, I would go in to the bathroom, take a giant, I would unroll  all this fucking toilet paper, so I had a big wad, I would put it on that metal thing  on the back of the toilet, and sit backwards on the toilet, and take a one hour nap on  my toilet paper pillow, because I was operating on like four hours sleep a night, because  I was doing the stuff, and I was just determined to, so I was so exhausted.  That's fucking smart, though.  Yeah, a beach going out to the car. 
[02:48:30]  That's great, because that's one of those things where, where's Pat?  He's in the bathroom.  What, are you going to bother him?  He's obviously got some kind of tummy upset again.  That pillow thing is crazy, doesn't it?  Yeah, I never thought about that.  Toilet paper pillow?  I guess so.  Have you ever tried that?  Nah.  What was he doing, taking a long shit?  No, napping.  Oh.  He had to take a nap.  I thought he took a dump.  No, he wasn't taking, oh, his dump is going to take a while, I'm going to need some rest.  I'm going to need some R&R while I'm here.  No shit.  Realizing that the bat, yes shit.  No, actually, you're right.  No shit. 
[02:49:00]  Who could, you just heard his voice, and you just thought he was the mouse.  That's all.  That's all I'm thinking about, man.  Who could started rubbing his genitals while you were playing that clip, and he wasn't  paying attention?  He's a little short, too.  Who, Patton?  Mm-hmm.  He's on the shorter side, I suppose.  He's almost a rat size.  Just thinking about the cartoon again.  Like a New York rat.  You ever saw a New York rat?  I have said, dude, we walked to the studio, you know, at like 4, 35 o'clock in the morning,  and there's a supermarket a couple blocks down.  Yeah.  Every morning, there's raccoon-sized rats running back and forth in front of that supermarket. 
[02:49:30]  I would never shop in that supermarket.  What street is that?  It's on like 50th.  Oh, okay.  Because when I was in the village, I saw a rat with pink shorts.  He was wearing pink shorts.  Did you see any of them with skinny jeans, or is that for the fall?  That's for the fall.  That's for the fall, right?  Pink shorts is heavy out there.  I guess it's one of them rainbow rats.  Pink shorts is heavy with the rats?  Is that right?  Down there, yes. 
[02:50:00]  Down there, anyway.  I've done that before.  There have been times...  You wore pink shorts before?  No, I'm not talking about the pink shorts anymore.  Oh, okay.  I don't wear pink shorts.  Well, I know where you got on right now.  None of your business, quite frankly.  What difference does it make to you what kind of underwear I got on?  Sal, this guy's commando today, man.  I'm not commando, and Sal doesn't care.  Sal doesn't care.  Questions for Who Kid coming in?  Mike in Indiana.  Yo, hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up, buddy?  I missed something.  Who Kid?  Why you want to fuck a rat? 
[02:50:30]  Why is it that you want to fuck a rat, Who Kid?  Nah, it's like a subliminal connection.  It's like I have a big cock and a pussy small,  so when you see something like a small animal, that's the pussy.  Right, like a rat.  So you want to kind of fuck a rat?  It's like a metaphor.  Right, I understand.  You've got to think two layers deeper, right?  I get it.  There have been times, like not in years, never here,  but especially back in the K-Rock days when we started earlier,  I was getting in here at like 4.30 in the morning.  We were doing five-hour shows instead of four-hour shows. 
[02:51:00]  If I had had a rough night the night before,  if I had been out the night before or something,  it would definitely be like I need five minutes to shut my eyes.  You go sit down on the toilet, shut the stall door.  Wow.  And that's where you shut your eyes.  That's the place.  Because nobody's going to bother you.  So you don't think about little pussies when you're in there?  No, man.  Why would I think about little pussies in the bathroom?  I don't know.  Have you ever seen a little pussy in the bathroom?  It's a men's room.  In my world, every pussy's small.  Well, I mean, I don't know that world.  We've talked about this. 
[02:51:30]  You don't have a big kid.  I mean, I don't have the big Who Kid monster penis.  Hell no, you don't.  No, I don't.  Well, Who Kid, we'll have to hear more about your penis tomorrow  because we're out of here for today.  Okay.  But we will be live tomorrow.  Don't get confused.  A lot of people trying to figure out when the O&A vacation starts.  It doesn't start today.  God damn it.  And that's great news then.  For them, not for me.  We'll all see you here tomorrow.

Let's go to Steve in Philly.  Steve.  Yes.  Hey, boys.  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, Steve.  So in Pulp Fiction, when Samuel L. Jackson and Travolta walk into the apartment with the three guys, and they get shot at, they miss. 
[02:57:00]  Even before they get shot at, you can see the holes in the wall.  That one's huge.  Fuck.  That one is huge.  I didn't know that one either.  You can see the holes in the wall before they even get shot.  Because they had other takes, obviously.  All right.  Movie mistakes.  And those are the bodies.  Dorothy's not wearing red slippers.  Oh, she doesn't have a little ruby slippers on.  Of the A-team, there's a great... 
[02:57:30]  What's his one?  Something with the headlines.  Friends.  Shirt's different.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Charm.  Phoebe spells her own name incorrectly.  What?  Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  All right.  He's sucking.  Television shows.  He's stinking.  We want a good one.  What's Brad Pitt?  Oh, there's an airplane in the sky.  Oh, God.  That's hilarious.  Come on.  Go back.  What is this?  It's called movie mistakes on YouTube.  No way.  That's where it was Achilles and...  Brad Pitt.  Yeah, it was in Troy.  It was awful.  Troy.  There's an airplane. 
[02:58:00]  Or is that a jet plane?  They didn't have airplanes back there.  Come on.  They could have gotten that out.  Yeah, sure they could have.  Star Wars Stormtrooper bangs his head on the door.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah, I've seen that one.  I like that.  I don't...  Is that like...  Oh, that's a camera guy.  That's a camera guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  During Harry Potter.  What a dummy.  What an asshole.  That made the final...  He looks like Martin Mull.  All right.  Star Wars full of mistakes.  Yeah, Star Wars.  That's what they were doing. 
[02:58:30]  I caught a good one in The Empire Strikes Back.  Oh, Star Wars, yes.  Darth Vader's shoes had the tread was more worn later in the film than earlier.  I could tell by the way he was walking.  It's just the music.  I love that music.  I want that to play whenever I walk into a room.  Yes, you do.  How do you know jazz here?  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah. 
[02:59:00]  Fuck.  Look at this, X-Men.  White paper, blue paper.  That's crazy.  That's crazy, yeah.  Shit is nuts.  I like the big ones where it's like fucking...  I wonder who's in charge of Harry Potter.  Stuff like that is...  The little stuff, I don't give a fuck about too much.  Let's go to Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Joe.  The end of Teen Wolf.  Have you ever seen the celebration scene on the stand?  The guy's got his zipper down, and he's waving his arms.  He looks down, and he's got to zip it back up. 
[02:59:30]  It's right before the credits start.  Yeah, but wouldn't that just be part of a teen movie?  Maybe he was doing that.  Oh, look.  Oh, no, that was a mistake.  What was that?  He had his underpants sticking out.  Yeah, that had nothing to do with the movie.  Oh, that is a good one, sir.  Sorry about that.  I caught a mistake in Teen Wolf, Gregory.  Teen Wolf?  Yes, I did.  Sir, stop interrupting me.  For Pete's sake, I was explaining the Teen Wolf film flub I caught, and I wrote to the 
[03:00:00]  director numerous times.  And what did you write?  I wrote that on one of the wolf's head, there was 4,328,575 hairs, and there were three  less in the next scene.  You didn't feel like going with the numbers?  Yes, I had to see the movie 14,881 times in the theater to count them accurately.  There's no way you could.  Everybody was yelling, down in front.  I was standing there with a pointer, yelling out numbers. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, you were yelling numbers.  I certainly won.  One, two.  Oh, sugar, it's all.  I have to come back for the next showing.  You're a fucking asshole.  It's the best of Opie and Anthony.

Expand your consciousness and dive deep into the world of Joe Rogan.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony channel on Sirius XM. 
[03:05:00]  The Joe Rogan experience begins now.  Buckle up, bitches.  Here we go.  Remember when we were kids, Tang was like the big thing?  Yeah, it came from the space program.  The big Google.  Like it made it good?  Tang was fucking terrible.  It was dog shit, fake orange juice.  Yeah, maybe they'll sell MREs as a great dinner.  That was one of the first commercial, that was one of the first product placement things.  Yeah.  The Tang people told us, I mean that wasn't good for people. 
[03:05:30]  It was ridiculous.  And they sold that as like the astronaut drink.  Proper nutrition.  You know, generations of Americans drank that shit.  It was homemade Gatorade.  Yeah, the watered-down shitty Gatorade.  We're getting our fucking astronaut water room.  Without the electrolytes.  Yeah, Tang's...  I'm going to be an astronaut.  Is Tang still around?  Is Tang still around?  I'm sure he is.  Let's find out if Tang's still around.  Yeah, it's still around.  You know, if people today...  More people somewhere are drinking it.  People today are so unimpressed.  If Tang was like, yeah, it's the astronaut program. 
[03:06:00]  They're like, bitch, where's your astronauts now?  Right.  It's like YouTube comments.  Like, where's your astronauts?  Who's going to the moon?  Yeah, the last famous astronaut was a stalker racing from Florida to Houston to stab a lover or something.  Well, I've been doing a bit that...  Wearing a diaper.  She was wearing a diaper.  Wearing a diaper so she didn't have to stop.  I wish Bingo could learn that trick.  She drove the entire time and just shit herself.  She was an astronaut.  She was crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Bitch was crazy.  Tang the drink.  It seems like it's still around. 
[03:06:30]  Hmm.  Most of that shit, if you look it up, you can buy it.  If you can't find it in the store, you can find it online.  I mean, Quisp cereal and old candy.  We're talking about marathon bars.  There's an original Tang.  Tang is sold in both powdered and ready-to-drink form.  Oh, New Tang is where they jump the shark.  Did they?  You can get original Tang now.  Yeah, you could actually buy, like, a sugar-free version of Tang containing aspartame.  Wow.  Hmm.  Oh, let's put more cancer in your diabetes. 
[03:07:00]  Hey, listen, Doug Stano.  There's 10% of the RDA of vitamin A, calcium, vitamin E, and riboflavin.  10%?  10%.  So 10 glasses of Tang and you're covered.  That's almost half what Cocoa Puffs has.  It's got 100% of your vitamin C.  Oh, that's actually pretty good.  100% of your vitamin C is not that much, though.  So the people that think you should take vitamin C think you should take, like, a good amount of it. 
[03:07:30]  Like, take that shit all the time.  But Doug Stano, you just take cigarettes and you're fine.  I have, I, I, this week I've been bad, but I, I had quit a lot.  You quit a lot?  You held it back?  Have you ever tried the electronic route?  Yeah, we've talked about this.  Yeah?  Yeah, Red Band said he was coughing up blood.  They're, they're, they're a lot better now.  Like, the newer ones are.  No, they're terrible because I just, I quit a month ago and I made it two weeks and I tried, like, four different brands.  And I was sucking on them constantly. 
[03:08:00]  And I was off the cigs for a couple of weeks, but my lungs were killing me at one point.  And then it comes a point where you're like, well, fuck, give me a cigarette.  Because you're just getting, like, blasts and blasts of nicotine.  Like, more nicotine than you would be getting from just having a cigarette.  I did great when I was at home alone.  I had, like, six weeks off and, I mean, it was full weeks I didn't smoke.  And then sometimes someone would show up at my house that smokes and I'd steal a cigarette, so I'd smoke a couple.  And then six weeks of 95% quit smoking went on the road. 
[03:08:30]  And I'm like, all right, now I'm just going to bum them from the fucking opening acts.  Yeah.  Whoever I find outside smoking, I send bingo out to go get me a couple cigarettes before the show.  And this week, it's just after the fucking first night of party we were talking about.  I'm buying packs.  Fuck it.  Well, once you say fuck it, and that's the problem with being a comic, is you're inclined to say fuck it more often than not because it seems like the comic choice.  You know, and you're in that situation, you're like, come on, what's the fuck?  This show must go on. 
[03:09:00]  I think there's a point.  I made it, I quit a month ago and I made it two weeks and I wasn't working.  Right.  And it was once I went back and I did shows in Atlanta and I was bumming them off the staff.  And then I was in Minneapolis the next weekend after that and like snuck a pack and then just said, fuck it.  I mean, I think like when you, because I was doing shows and that's my rhythm and having a cig and getting ready.  You have a cigar on stage while you're doing shows?  No, I don't want to influence the kids.  But like before and after.  Yeah.  That was the thing where at the comedy store, it was a big deal because guys would smoke on stage and the audience members couldn't smoke. 
[03:09:30]  Because there was a provision of law.  Oh, right.  It's a part of the show.  Yeah.  As a part of the performance, you're allowed to smoke.  But I think they dropped that.  I don't think they allowed you to do that anymore.  A lot of places, I remember, because I would, I did that, immediately I was doing that when they passed it in California.  Once I found out about that law and I was doing it in Minneapolis and then a bar started doing that as a night where smokers could be on stage.  And so the place is just all smoky, but you had to be on the stage. 
[03:10:00]  Everyone's part of the performance so they could smoke, right?  So they pushed it so far into their face that they changed the law.  And I think most places have changed the law.  Yeah, that sucks.  They fucked it up.  Remember when we started, the clubs, everyone smoked in the 80s.  Honestly, I didn't mind back then.  I loved it.  The smoke would dance in the spotlight.  You're on stage.  It was sexy.  It was like a film noir movie.  There is something about it, man.  And pool halls as well.  I don't like it.  I don't like cigarettes.  I think they're disgusting.  And it scares me when I see my friend smoke because I know you're going to die ugly. 
[03:10:30]  I know you're going to die ugly and I love you.  I tell this guy all the time.  I love him, but he smokes.  And when I see him smoke, I get scared.  I get scared that you're locked up in a wrestling match with a dragon.  It's a dark demon that's going to slowly rot you out from the insides and it tricks you into doing it.  It sucks you into its web with habit and novelty and the idea that it's beautiful to fucking smoke and suck it in.  It feels good.  I know.  That's one thing.  And then the other thing is it becomes a part of your body. 
[03:11:00]  It becomes a part of you.  You need it.  It becomes your system.  Your body gets integrated into accepting this on a daily basis.  I feel like I got my equipment.  I don't know.  Someone about having a pack of cigarettes and a lighter on me.  Well, listen.  I'm not judging.  I have friends that smoke.  I'm just telling you my feelings.  You're all set.  You're secure.  I got what I need.  Retirement?  Fuck that.  I get a carton.  And I'm a hypocrite because I like smoking weed.  And I don't think smoking weed is bad for you.  It's certainly not bad for you in the same way.  Now, once the cigarette companies get a hold of it. 
[03:11:30]  Either way, I don't think it's the best thing for you.  Is it the best thing in the world for you to smoke a plant?  I thought you went straight to vaporizer and edibles.  I do those, too.  Yeah.  I like edibles the most.  I just watch Dee smoke, so she's fuck up.  No, no.  I do that, too.  I mean, Dee.  Oh, yeah.  But I'm hypocritical in that sense because smoking is not good.  It's not good to smoke something.  You know, anything we...  Like Diaz stopped smoking.  He only eats it and uses a vaporizer because he said his lungs started feeling way better 
[03:12:00]  once he did that.  I believe it.  And the edibles, as someone who doesn't live in California, the edibles here are ridiculous.  You got every candy, Jolly Rancher candy, weed, you know, York peppermint patties, anything  you can think of, they've duplicated exactly like candy or...  Well, there's a little bit of an issue.  There is a little bit of an issue with it.  It's beautiful that it exists, and I'm a complete libertarian in the idea that you should  be able to...  You almost lit your filter. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  But this place is...  The weed culture in California is so more evolved than Amsterdam.  Yeah.  Well, they're so powerful that it's really like an intense psychedelic.  If you eat one of these pot brownies or these chuba chews, chuba chews, they have these chuba  chews that are like seven...  How many...  What is the milligrams?  Take one-fourth if you don't want to die as fast.  Yeah, I mean, they're insane.  If you take the whole...  It's one candy.  And if you take that one candy, you will re-experience your entire life from the moment you were an egg 
[03:13:00]  and the cum washed over you and turned you into two eggs and your cells are dividing.  That's the ride I'm looking for.  If you take one of these candies, could you take, say one of these candies, say you already  have a pre-existing condition, a mental illness, say, and say you're at a rock star's house  trying to get a podcast and you're doing incredible amounts of blow and you go home with a little 
[03:13:30]  bit of that blow and then you do the rest of that blow while your boyfriend's sleeping  preparing for the Bill Burr podcast and you also eat an edible while you have a pre-existing  condition.  Could you spiral into such a catatonic state that the landlord from the Airbnb that you're  staying in comes in to talk to you and you won't respond to him so your boyfriend and  your tour manager have to put you in bed where you piss the bed in your first Airbnb and  then it takes you 24 hours to come out of said catatonic state? 
[03:14:00]  If I had a guess, I could say that could happen.  Hypothetically?  Did Marilyn Manson give you a gift bag when you left and the cocaine and edibles?  It wasn't me.  It totally happened.  It wasn't me.  Skin moisturizer.  It wasn't me.  You've got to be careful with that shit.  I had to check her text messages and it said, well, hey, we'll be there on time.  I just stand up sleeping and I just ate a pot candy and then I see an empty baggie and I'm  like, you did all that?  And now? 
[03:14:30]  They can get you.  They can get you and take you on a ride that you're just not, you're not going to be  capable of going out and just doing things, going to the airport, getting your clothes  on.  You're not going to be capable.  And that's just, you could buy it at any store.  Go buy one of these cupcakes.  Buy one of these rocket cookies.  Take this cookie and go right to the center of the fucking universe.  I mean, they're intense psychedelics.  We've talked about it before, but the chemical processes, when you eat it.  Wait, is this ground already worked over on the Joe Rogan experience? 
[03:15:00]  Cookies?  Yeah.  We've talked about it a few times.  I know it sounds crazy.  It seems so novel.  I was at the clubs in LA.  People at home are going, go back to Ting.  Tang?  What about Tang again?  If you eat that shit, it'll hurt you.  It'll hurt you.  You've got to be real careful.  I've seen comedians all over LA with those little pen vaporizer things.  That's different.  That's not eating it.  When you're eating it, you're getting this 11-hydroxymetabolite.  Oh, see, I always assumed those were e-cigarettes that everyone has. 
[03:15:30]  There's a lot of those, too.  No, those are little weed vaporizers.  Oh, wow.  And they hit like a motherfucker.  They do hit like a motherfucker, but there's both.  That's why they exist.  That's the product I want to endorse.  That should be their slogan.  What?  Hits like a motherfucker.  I don't think that's a good move.  If I read Hits like a Motherfucker, I'd be like, who is the guy that's making this?  That's all you can come up with?  But in podcasting, you could probably get a copy like that.  Oh, yeah.  It wouldn't even be Hits like a Motherfucker.  This kicked me in the balls like a motherfucker. 
[03:16:00]  You should buy this.  This will take you on a ride to the center of the universe, my man.  And my man would be highlighted.  You know, feel free to use your own colloquialism.  It's funny.  When you were about to start, Red Band said, okay, we're live.  And you go, oh, shit, we're live.  Oh, don't say anything.  You were making a joke.  Right.  Like, oh, don't say anything.  We're live.  It's opposite.  Yesterday, I fell in love with a man. 
[03:16:30]  Fucking Bert Kreischer.  He's a great man.  I fucking, like, I clicked with him so quickly.  The first time you met him?  No, I've met him before, but we never really hung out.  Oh, he's the best.  He's a sweetie, too.  And I knew that, yeah.  He's a sweetie.  Fucking wicked man crush right away.  His house is just like my house down to the, I walked in, I knew exactly where his booze  stash was.  I'm like, I'm just, I'm going to make a drink.  Anyway, fucking fell in love with the guy.  He's a sweetie.  We had to pause and go to break where we'd talk about, like, shit that, and then we'd 
[03:17:00]  come back on the air.  And there's certain stuff you can't talk about?  Like, trash talking other comics.  Oh, oh.  Come back on the air.  Well, he's on the Travel Channel, too.  And the Travel Channel is owned by some religious folks.  Oh, yeah.  Not like that, but.  But that is a problem.  But.  He's got to be real careful about what he does.  I'm trying to make a drink.  I mean, he doesn't smoke weed.  But if he did, he wouldn't do it on Ustream.  You know what I'm saying?  Who owns the Travel Channel? 
[03:17:30]  Somebody that loves the baby Jesus.  Allegedly.  I might be just talking shit.  I don't know.  This is what I've read from Anthony Bourdain.  Okay.  And there's certain conversations I might have had with him.  Oh, did you have Bourdain on the show?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  He's a good dude.  I love that guy.  You know, his wife is a jujitsu fanatic.  That's my in.  That's how I got to meet Bourdain.  You know?  He followed me or retweeted me or something, and it was like, I was so starstruck.  He's the best.  He's following me.  He's a sweetie.  If you met the guy, you would love him. 
[03:18:00]  He's a sweetie.  His show is, since he's gone to CNN, I guess they had, you know, visa access.  So, like, his show's just gone to a whole different level now.  Yeah.  He's, like, in Myanmar now.  Yeah, we're going to, Brian, by the way, I got plans, and one of the plans is flying  to New York to do podcasts with people that we can't get to fly out here.  Yeah.  So, like, I can't keep asking people to just come out here.  So, guys like Bourdain, I'm going to find out when he's going to be there, and I'll just  go in.  Well, if they're driving, have him come to Bisbee.  I'm going to try to use the Sirius studios.  He should do a high level on Bisbee. 
[03:18:30]  Because we are on Sirius.  We're on Sirius.  I don't know if you know that.  Oh, yeah.  I listen to it all the time.  It's the weirdest.  But, um, so I wanted to get, like, Bourdain and a few other guys that live there.  C.K.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Louis is just so fucking busy.  I feel bad asking him.  Yeah, but he's on Opie and Anthony all the time.  Yeah, but that's, like, you know, when he can in the morning.  I'll ask him.  But, um, I know he's crazy.  He's the most ridiculously busy person I've ever met.  Yeah.  He's got a great, this is a great bit that I saw that someone made a clip of.  Him talking about, it was, it's really funny. 
[03:19:00]  It starts him talking about nut allergies, and he compares, like, things that you know  to be true, but there's always this, too.  But maybe, like, it's like, but I know, but maybe.  It's fucking really funny, man.  It's really funny.  I didn't see one of C.K.'s bits, his new bits, off of his new special.  God damn, it was good.  It was really funny.  New special, not...  Yeah, the new one was, he was in Phoenix in the theater in the round.  It was really, really good stuff, man. 
[03:19:30]  It's like, you listen to it, you read it, and you watch it, rather, and you're like,  fuck, I want to go write something.  Like, this, like, made me want to go write.  It was really good.  Yeah.  You know?  That's the best thing about, like, I used to always think that about, like, when Chappelle  would come to the store.  Like, I'd always want to run home and write.  Yeah.  You know?  Like, anything that gives you that, that little juice, like, you want to create, too, because  you know how good it made you feel.  Like, the last time I saw Chappelle at the store, he just, it was, like, the height of  his popularity.  Before, uh, he, uh, he'd quit the Comedy Central show, and he was just, he would just show up, 
[03:20:00]  like, maybe, like, the day before they would schedule this, and he would just be mobbed,  and he was in the main room.  And, uh, he, it was so funny, and so, like, I hadn't seen him in, like, six months, and  it was all new shit.  It was, like, 100% new, and it was, like, a new hour.  And you, you left there, you're going, just going, God damn, I need to go to work.  I want to go write.  He had that gift, I'll say in a very fucking stupid way, but he's one of those guys, he 
[03:20:30]  talks funny anyway, so he already has a leg up.  You said it best.  You said it best, that Diaz could read the phone book.  Right.  Right.  So, he has that already, but he can write, too.  So, if it's new shit, what, what would, you know, be filler to him would be a closer to  me.  Yeah.  Diaz has, I mean, I don't, I don't want to give up any of his material, but he's got  this bit about this chick named Lucy Snorbush.  He's told the story about, on the podcast, but now he's turned into a bit in his act, a 
[03:21:00]  true story about him sneaking into her house, climbing into her window and eating her pussy  in the middle of the night and then escaping.  I don't think I've ever laughed as hard in my life.  We just did Santa Barbara together, and I was watching him on stage, and he's doing this  Lucy Snorbush thing, and I'm having a hard time catching my breath.  Like, I'm legitimately having a hard time catching my breath.  I saw Diaz in San Francisco, and he was doing that bit where he's like, he punches a hooker,  and the audience is dying. 
[03:21:30]  In San Francisco, they're like, usually really touchy about, like, who can get a laugh?  Who can get a hooker with a black guy?  The dude with the wig and a black guy.  And those support groups for these people.  He's one of the best ever.  Like, as far as, like, just human being.  I can hear him saying, Lisa Snorbush.  Yeah.  Lucy Snorbush.  Lucy Snorbush.  That was her name.  Lucy Snorbush.  It was painfully funny.  It was painfully funny.  He's my all-time favorite.  Out of all the people I've ever seen that made me laugh the hardest, there's not a single 
[03:22:00]  person who's ever made me laugh harder than Diaz.  Me and Kreischer were picking our ultimate four-man tour with a wild card fuck-up.  Diaz.  Yeah.  He picked Diaz as his fuck-up.  I have to see him.  Diaz is so good that I started taking two guys on the road with me during the dark days  when Diaz would just go vanish in the middle of the night.  But he was so good that I said, okay, I need a backup opener. 
[03:22:30]  So I would bring two openers, because there was too many times when Diaz just vanished.  He just would disappear.  He just couldn't call him.  I got booked like that for Otto and George, where they wanted to book Otto and George,  but they needed to co-headline him so if he didn't show up, there was another X-rated  act that could fit the fucking marquee.  You've got to do that, man, unfortunately, with some guys, but they're worth it.  Diaz is...  And now he's super reliable.  Now he's just...  Every gig, he's there.  I'm too old to disappear. 
[03:23:00]  Well, he's just into comedy now.  And I think for the first time in his life, he's being recognized for what he does, and  he's enjoying creating new shit.  He's enjoying being a comic.  Like, when I talked to him about it, he's got a lot of other success.  Like, he's always getting called into movies and shit, and, you know, he did that...  I sat through the grudge match just because I knew he was in it.  He's having a lot of those that are happening to him, but the big thing is his stand-up,  man.  His stand-up.  He's selling out everywhere.  He deserves it. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, he fucking does.  What a difference when the audience already loves you when you get there, you know, instead  of having to win him over.  Different animal.  Dude, he went on stage in Santa Barbara when we worked together, and I've taken some of  his openings where I introduce him, and then I film it, like, watching him go on stage.  I put him on YouTube because they're so ridiculous.  He goes on stage, and people are standing up, like, bowing to him, screaming.  Like, 2,000 people screaming and bowing to Joey Diaz.  That's so good.  And for a guy like that to finally get that, you know, dude, I just take him on the road. 
[03:24:00]  And it's always great to see a guy that age.  Yeah.  Yeah, he deserves it, though, man.  He's an animal, dude.  He's an animal.  He's an animal.  If I could hire a 24-hour nurse to keep him alive, I would.  I just don't think he would.  Get the fuck out of there.  Listen, I'm Cuban.  I'm never going to die.  Get out of here, bitch.  Kick him out of his house.  You've got to, like, find out.  A guy like that, you've got to take care of him in a gentle fashion.  You've got to figure out how to keep him alive.  But you've got to look sneaky.  Trick him.  Yeah, I'm going to...  Put that pill in a piece of cheese.  Find some fucking new drugs and put it in his ice cream. 
[03:24:30]  Take it and put it in something.  Some new thing, regenerative tissue thing that the government invents.  Just throw it in his food.  Hey, Brian told me the other night you're getting your blood re-injected.  Was that bullshit?  No, no, no, no.  You fucker.  No, it was true.  Well, it's not your blood re-injected.  It's called Regina Keene.  What the fuck?  It was invented by this German guy.  It's your blood.  They spit it in a centrifuge and they heat it up.  So you take your blood out and then you whip it in this machine.  We're doing ad copy again? 
[03:25:00]  No.  Regina Keene.com.  There's a guy named Dr. Peter Weller, I believe his name is.  He developed this process for dealing with inflammation.  That's the other guy.  You know, you might be right.  I might have the wrong guy.  Hold on a second.  That's a good...  I'll do the ad while you look it up.  It's not an ad.  Regina Keene.com.  Hey, are you tired of looking at those tenagenics guys?  Half naked in a SkyMall catalog?  Oh, Douglas.  This will make your face young, too.  Oh, Douglas.  Anybody that's in pain, it can be a tremendous help. 
[03:25:30]  It's the most potent anti-inflammatory drug that human beings have ever figured out.  Well, I did it a few times.  It's amazing.  It was all these professional athletes.  That is so Keith Richards of you.  I have an anti-inflammatory drug.  It's called alcoholism, and it works on my penis.  I don't think it works.  It hasn't been inflamed in years.  Peter Welling, you're right.  It's Welling.  It's not Robocop.  Say it again.  I said Weller.  No, no, what did you say to me?  Oh, you're right?  Yeah.  Sweetie, I love you.  You're right always. 
[03:26:00]  I'm blushing.  I refer to you more than I refer to myself.  How about that?  But he was a guy in Germany who figured this shit out.  They take your blood, and they heat it.  And your blood has a reaction, while it's still viable, it has a reaction to the heat  as if it's got a fever.  And it creates this intense anti-inflammatory response.  So it's in the very blood itself.  They take it out of your body.  They heat it.  They spin it.  And then it creates this yellow shit.  And this yellow shit, they pull it out.  And they call it something Regenikine serum.  I don't know the technical.  And then they squirt it into anywhere you have arthritis, anywhere you have any kind 
[03:26:30]  of swelling, inflammation.  And it has a magical response.  That's why all these athletes, like, that's who got Peyton Manning back in a football.  He had two neck surgeries.  And he was fucked.  And he went to Germany, and he got this procedure done on his neck, and it just fixed it.  It's crazy.  I was talking to Sean Rouse.  I don't know if you know him.  Yeah.  He has serious arthritis.  Yeah, and he wants to talk to you about it.  I would love to talk to him about it.  I mean, if you look at his hands, he needs to, like, break all his hands, like, go to  his operations, and, you know. 
[03:27:00]  No, he's got some serious arthritis.  Yeah, Sean, Jesus Christ, he's got the most crippling arthritis.  Which, I should say, because of Sean Rouse, I saw a young comedian get knocked the fuck  out the other night at the comedy store.  Somebody got knocked out by an audience member?  I was sitting there with Jason Rouse, Canadian guy who lived in London, and J.J.  Whitehead, Canadian guy's at the other end, and then Sean, and he was plastered, man.  Who was Rouse?  Sean Rouse. 
[03:27:30]  No way.  Yeah, he's sitting there.  This story just lost all credibility.  I'm talking to, there's a guy from Boston, Mike Favorman, or whatever.  Sure.  This tall, young, open mic comedian, we found out he was an open micer later, comes up.  I thought he knew Jason and J.J. because of the way he's making fun of them.  One guy, Jason's got a lot of tats.  He's making stupid tattoo jokes.  Right.  And I'm kind of talking to Mike from Boston.  Is Chaley there?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Chaley wasn't there.  He had left earlier. 
[03:28:00]  We heard that Rouse was really fucked up.  Rouse was.  Yeah, he was plastered.  So anyway, this fucking...  Tom Rhodes, bronze medalist in story editing.  This comedian, the guy, he turns to Sean, very grandly, to the table, and he goes,  I'm sorry to bother you, gentlemen, I just couldn't pass up the chance to meet Moby.  And he sticks his hand out to Sean, who's all fucked up and can barely lift his head.  This kid was a fucking douche.  And Mike from Boston's got the kind of taxi driver newsstand guy hat on.  And then the kid, grandly, turns... 
[03:28:30]  There's a table of veteran comedians sitting here.  Grandly turns to Mike and he goes, I'll be seeing you in the morning when I come to pick up my newspaper.  Faberman?  You said it to Faberman?  You said it to Faberman.  Oh.  Faberman doesn't play.  I turned, and this kid was being such...  And I was joking around when I said it.  I turned to Mike, I go, I'll give you $20 if you punch this kid in the face.  And his comedic timing was brilliant.  He didn't miss.  Just, boom! 
[03:29:00]  And this kid went back, and it was...  Who won't?  This hell broke loose.  Do you know what his name is?  I don't know what the kid's name, but...  Oh, my God.  Faberman is a legit savage.  He's the wrong guy to fuck with.  Well, I mean, who this guy?  And then all this, you know, and then he's on the sidewalk.  Was this in the showroom?  No, no, out on the patio bar.  Faberman has a story.  It's like the Wild West there, man.  Faberman has a story about fucking this maid.  It's one of the funniest stories I've ever heard in my life.  Hey, why don't you sit over there? Pull up a picture of Faberman.  Listen, do you not have to yell at me?  I just don't know if I... 
[03:29:30]  Jesus Christ.  You don't know Mike Faberman?  No.  Really?  I don't know.  He's a good dude.  I just met him recently.  He's a great dude.  He had this story about he was beaten off in his hotel room, and the maid opened up the door,  and the maid freaked out.  He goes, no, no, no, no, come on, shut the door, shut the door, shut the door.  He's like the only guy ever to get caught beating off and fucking a maid.  Like, ever.  Like, he really did it.  He said, I go, what does she look like?  Did he pay her?  No, no.  I go, what does she look like?  She goes, it wasn't no prize.  It wasn't no prize.  Jesus, he looks like Edmund. 
[03:30:00]  Mike's a good dude.  He's a good dude.  He's a very good cook.  Oh, wait, he plays Punchy and Ray Donovan.  He doesn't.  That picture.  I know the picture.  It's the hat, man.  But it was like a movie scene, this kid, and he was just, you know.  Faberman will punch you in your fucking face.  He's crazy.  He's always been crazy.  He's a good dude, though.  He loves Asians.  Oh, the wife beater right there.  There he is with the homeboy from the radio.  What's his name?  Oh, which one? 
[03:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  Uh, uh, uh, Fraser Smith.  Fraser Smith.  And Don Barris.  He's a Boston guy?  Fraser Smith used to have a radio show here in LA.  No, no, Faberman.  Yeah, he's from Boston originally.  Yeah.  Faberman.  I was just going to say he looked like the funniest guy at the barbecue, and you switched  to a picture of barbecue.  I hung out with Faberman, Joey Diaz, and Ralphie May the day 9-11 happened.  Wow.  The day they shut down all the flights, the day the shit hit the fan, we all got high, 
[03:31:00]  we went to Baja Fresh, we ate some burritos, and we stared at the sky.  It's like, dude, there's no planes.  There's no fucking planes.  And then we went over to Ralphie's place, and Ralphie and Faberman lived, like, in the  same area.  Was he a gardener then?  Faberman?  No, Ralphie.  By my old place.  It was...  Gardener by coaching horses?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Actually, you know what?  We went to...  I'm sorry.  We went to Faberman's place, and Ralphie came over to buy weed.  Because Faberman used to sell weed.  That was your September 11th.  Because you used to live in that same sort of building. 
[03:31:30]  He's the fattest guy in the world, because this is Armageddon, and we're going to need  to eat someone.  Faberman had some good weed.  No, he had some good weed.  And we were like, well, the world is ending.  Let's go get fucked up.  So we went and got high.  It was me, and Diaz, and Faberman, and Ralphie May.  And it was 2001.  It was the day when we were just sitting around, smoking weed, talking about how crazy it is.  Like, this might be...  We might be in the middle of a war.  We were thinking at that moment in time that this is just the beginning.  That planes flew into buildings. 
[03:32:00]  But what if shit starts happening left and right?  Like, what if we start seeing missiles headed to L.A.?  What if we see L.A. hit with a nuke?  Like, fuck.  Well, that's just as likely as two planes flying into buildings in the same day.  So we were freaking out, and we were all getting high together.  So I'll always have a special bar.  I was in Amsterdam at the zoo.  Three o'clock at the zoo in Amsterdam is feeding time.  That's 3 p.m. is 9 a.m. in New York City.  And I had been there before for it, and I knew I wanted to be in front of the lion cages at three o'clock when they're throwing the meat out. 
[03:32:30]  And, like, it's cool.  The lions start, they can smell the meat in the back.  And they'd start pacing and growling, and there's these metal doors, and they're scratching on it and shit.  It's pretty cool.  And then they open the metal doors, and they grab the meat.  So when the planes hit, I was watching lions rip raw meat apart.  Oh, see, I would have assumed all the animals would have run for the hills knowing 9-11 was about to happen. 
[03:33:00]  How come they don't do that?  The Netherlands is so open-minded.  Why don't they feed those animals animals?  Why do they have to feed them?  No.  They want to eat animals.  More important, why is Baja Fresh open on 9-11?  Jesus Christ.  Baja Fresh supports our troops.  Our troops need to fuel up.  They were a part of it.  Some healthy carbs.  That's what it is.  Our troops need to fuel up.  We need beans.  We need beans and jalapenos.  Baja Fresh supports the troops. 
[03:33:30]  Mike Faberman was the guy that actually put together that boxing match with all the comics.  Oh, yeah.  And I was really bummed out about that.  One of the guys had cerebral palsy, and I was like, that's not good.  If it's Josh Blue against Crazy Legs Fonseca?  Either one of those guys should not be hitting each other, and then maybe falling on each other  and headbutting each other on the way down.  Fonseca's in a chair.  How far can he fall?  They're both going to get fucked up.  Shit can happen.  How did I not hear about a comedy boxing match, and when did this happen? 
[03:34:00]  Oh, it's filmed, too.  He filmed it.  He's trying to make it a show.  It's really good.  Comedy boxing match.  I know too much about brain damage.  But how did this happen?  When did this happen?  I don't know.  Was it Faberman's idea?  Yeah, Faberman and Rusty Dooley.  Who fought who?  Rusty Dooley.  Yeah.  Rusty Dooley, best six-pack in all of comedy.  Kid's shredded.  No doubt.  I have two three-packs.  I got a vernal hernia, ventral hernia.  Do you really?  Yeah, my six-pack split.  You should get that shit fixed.  Yeah. 
[03:34:30]  Bravo had one of those.  Eddie, he had one of those.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he did two of them.  One on each side.  He got it fixed.  He never had a problem again.  Yeah, ventral just means front.  I found out through my doctor Google.  It's pretty intense.  They put like a webbing.  Yeah, mesh in your skin, and they sew it in.  And they sew the area that's wounded.  And it becomes more strong.  I got that in my umbilical hernia.  Then I coughed myself into a groinal hernia that I haven't had fixed.  And now I have a ventral hernia.  I showed it to Kreischer on his podcast.  He took pictures. 
[03:35:00]  So that'll be up next week.  Jesus Christ.  It's like an alien bursting out of your chest.  What is it?  What is it from?  It's your six-pack splits, and your guts start to...  Only in a position.  I was trying to stretch my back like I was doing sit-ups.  You get a hernia when you're trying to stretch your back?  No, no.  That's how I noticed it.  It doesn't hurt or anything.  Oh, you don't feel anything?  No, no.  I was trying to lean off the back of a bed, like most of my body, and I leaned down.  And then my fucking...  This hump comes out of my chest like alien. 
[03:35:30]  And Bingo looked down at it, and it audibly screamed.  And I'm like, oh shit, that can't be good.  Dude, dude, dude, seriously.  Imagine if you were really possessed.  What would you do?  If, like, demons started running around in your stomach?  I wouldn't do a sit-up off the bed, and I'd be fine.  If you sat back, and you were like, what the fuck?  And it's like little jack-o'-lanterns underneath your skin, moving around your stomach.  What would you do, Doug Stanhope?  Would you go to Jesus?  I'd do exactly what I'm doing with this hernia and the other hernia, is ignore it. 
[03:36:00]  No, you can't ignore a fucking jack-o'-lantern demon living in your gut.  If you saw it poking through your skin and moving around and laughing at you, you'd have to address it.  No, I would drink, and then...  Ask Tom.  When you drink, it's easy to ignore obvious problems.  But that's been my life medical plan.  Like, my family.  You know, you don't go to the doctor unless you get a bullet wound.  Right.  And I just got insurance.  His family invented the phrase, it's just a flesh wound.  I just got health insurance under the deadline. 
[03:36:30]  And I actually, I stopped drinking January 1st.  I blacked out in Philadelphia.  Oh, good story.  And I busted my head open.  I got six stitches.  See the nice scar?  Whoa.  Yeah.  And I didn't, you know, it's too bad.  What was it, was, did they figure out what caused it?  I got drunk and fell down.  So just being hammered.  Hang on, I've heard the story, so I'm going to use this opportunity to piss.  So you, so you blacked out just because you were drunk and then you fell down. 
[03:37:00]  Has it ever happened before?  I mean, I've, I've, I've, I've, for a, for a second.  Over the years it's happened a couple times.  But, I mean, getting drunk and falling down is one thing.  But if you, did you black out?  I kind of blacked out.  I, I, I was not working.  I was, I did Helium in Philadelphia for New Year's Eve.  Great room.  Had three, uh, sold out shows.  Fantastic fucking night.  Uh, it wasn't New Year's Eve night.  I had, uh, because New Year's Eve was on a Wednesday.  They had me do the stay for the Friday, Saturday.  I'm off January 1st. 
[03:37:30]  And I went out by myself.  I actually stayed in and worked all day.  And then I went out about eight, nine o'clock and I, I watched the Fiesta Bowl.  And I had 10 Sierra Nevadas.  My brother was at the game.  And, uh, I texted my brother.  I was texting my brother.  Great game.  Love you, bro.  And just, uh, fell forward off a stool and hit the tile ground.  And this guy grabs my arm and he's lifting me up and he goes,  We gotta call an ambulance.  And I go, fuck that. 
[03:38:00]  I don't have health insurance.  My, I, I woke up once and I hit it the ground, by the way.  But this guy goes, we gotta call an ambulance.  I go, fuck that.  I don't have health insurance.  Don't you dare call an ambulance.  I go, how far is the hospital?  He said, two blocks.  I go, two blocks and you were gonna call an ambulance?  That's like 15 grand.  Oh my God.  You know, and I, so I walked to the hospital, but, you know, I didn't have health insurance.  And, uh, you know, I had the Obama deadline been January 1st.  I'd have been covered.  What, what, does anybody understand this?  Uh, do you know about anything about it?  No, I got, uh, at some points, I, I met a insurance person and I have, like, catastrophic insurance. 
[03:38:30]  So if I get, like, really fucked up in a car wreck, they'll cover that.  I don't, I, again, I don't go to doctors.  It's just not something like that.  I don't either.  It's probably a good move.  So I don't have any idea how health insurance works.  Yeah, no, if I, if I need to get out of a social situation really badly, I'll go to a doctor because I know they're going to go, oh, this, you have to be admitted right away.  And I'll go, sorry, honey, I can't go to bed and breakfast with your parents like I promised when I was drunk. 
[03:39:00]  That's a fucking great strategy.  As long as you can keep the wheels on it, it's a great strategy.  Because there's a lot of cars that keep rolling down the hill and they make a lot of squeaky noises and, but they still get there somehow.  How many surgeries have you had?  Many.  How many?  And you're in perfect Europe.  What kind of insurance do you have?  Perfect physical specimen.  That you can get your blood.  So the point is, he's in perfect physical condition, doesn't smoke cigarettes.  He's had, I've had one surgery that I got for free on a trade-out by asking for it on my website. 
[03:39:30]  Hey, listen, I'm not denying that you make a lot of good points.  I would never tell anybody to take the path that I've taken.  Like physically?  It's not a good move.  Yes, you would.  No, I wouldn't unless you really wanted to.  But if you tear your knee doing something, don't keep doing it.  You get six months of rehab.  I just couldn't wait for the six months to get over.  I'm always sad when I see a friend that's into MMA because I know he's going to die an ugly death.  You know, all bullshit aside, I am sad when I see a guy who doesn't know that he shouldn't be doing it. 
[03:40:00]  There's a lot of guys that wind up, not jiu-jitsu.  Jiu-jitsu is for anybody.  Anybody can do jiu-jitsu.  But competitive MMA, there's some guys that just shouldn't be doing it.  Good, because at the end of this podcast, Tom and I are going to jiu-jitsu each other in a death match.  It's going to be the biggest girl-kicking match in the world.  Slap fight.  Getting hit is a completely different story, though.  You know, I've had two knee surgeries. 
[03:40:30]  I've had a nose surgery.  Those are like the two big ones.  Nose surgery?  Yeah, I've actually had three knee surgeries, now that I think about it.  Because I had two on one knee.  I had an ACL reconstructed.  Then I had my meniscus scoped.  And the other one, I had the ACL reconstructed.  And then I had my nose opened up.  Because I had a lot of scar tissue in there.  When you forget surgeries, I remember my cousin did a pilot.  My cousin did a pilot in 1984 with Christopher Lloyd.  He's the guy from Back to the Future?  Yeah, Massachusetts. 
[03:41:00]  Your snapshot was in the paper in the back row of a thing.  Everyone talks about it.  So it was a big deal.  And I moved to L.A.  I saw Christopher Lloyd at the bar at the improv.  And I went up and I go,  Hey, I don't know if you remember.  I don't want to approach you.  But Grant Forsberg is my cousin.  And you did a television pilot with him in the 80s.  And he goes, I don't know.  I did a lot of TV shows.  How do you get that fucking...  Yeah, well, fuck that you forget a TV show.  But when you forget surgeries... 
[03:41:30]  Well, you think about how many TV shows that guy's had.  I've only had four surgeries.  Four pretty major ones.  But you forgot one.  Actually, now that I think about it, it's three knee surgeries.  Well, you start treating your body like a car.  You know, you blow out a tire.  You go, alright, you've got to get another tire.  Can they fix it?  As long as they can fix it.  But shit that gets weird is like spinal shit.  And that's why I've been getting this Regenicene shit.  The Regenicene stuff is because of a bulging disc.  Wait, you haven't stopped mixed martial arts.  Well, not jiu-jitsu. 
[03:42:00]  I haven't stopped jiu-jitsu.  You've gotten into Regenicene from some Nazi doctor.  Mengele Jr. has got you on the yellow stuff.  I had to take a break for like a year from jiu-jitsu because of this injury.  So I'm trying to get back in shape to do it again.  It's just too much fun.  You know, it's like, that's why I sympathize with you guys smoking cigarettes.  I understand what you're doing.  It's just my, what I do, the risks I take are a different kind of physical.  You're going to see Sean Rouse shaking in an alley, scratching his arm. 
[03:42:30]  I need some more of the yellow shit, man.  Heat my blood.  I need more of the yellow shit.  It's not cheap.  That's the other problem.  You think it's...  Rouse making money?  Do you think Obamacare would take care of it?  I'll suck your dick, man.  Sean, you're not that young anymore.  I saw.  Yeah, I don't think it is.  I don't think it's covered by any insurance.  It's what's called off-label.  I saw.  You can only buy it in Bitcoin.  It's that kind of thing.  Dogecoin.  You can use Dogecoin, too.  They accept, now accepting.  Dogecoin. 
[03:43:00]  I made, from that thing with that dude, it's over $2,000.  That's amazing.  $2,100 going to him.  Yeah.  We had people donate Bitcoin, and I would treat the Bitcoin like it was real money, and  then I would take whatever anybody donated in Bitcoin and send it to my friend who's living  in the Congo.  And he's helping pygmies in the Congo.  He's building the wells and shit.  So he's going to send, you know, it's going to be real.  Actually, fuck it.  I'll double it.  Whatever it is.  That's awesome.  Whatever they have, all right, whatever other people put in, I'll put in the exact same amount. 
[03:43:30]  So I think it's like $2,100.  It's pretty cool.  That's great.  Because the guy's living in the Congo, you know.  I mean, he used to be a mixed martial arts fighter, and he just went down there for like  a vacation just to see what it was like.  And he fell in love with these people.  Like this idea that these people in the Congo, these pygmies, are these like really suppressed  people that are forced to work in mines, and they don't have any, no one's taking care  of them.  There's no medicine.  There's no water.  They don't have clean water.  So he's building them wells and shit.  And it's really amazing.  It's amazing shit.  Joe, do you want to put a disclaimer, though? 
[03:44:00]  Like a maximum amount?  Because you don't want to be like, I don't want to go bankrupt.  If it's more than like 50 grand, you can go fuck yourself.  It gets crazy.  I like the pygmies, but come on.  Yeah, because I mean, it's Bitcoin.  Some guy's just like, oh yeah, here's 2 billion Bitcoin.  That's what's weird about it.  It's like it varies.  Like one day it'll be worth 2,900 bucks, or 1,900 bucks.  The other day it'll be worth 2,100 bucks.  It totally varies from day to day.  It's strange.  It's like, it makes a lot of sense. 
[03:44:30]  If you don't know what it is, do you know what it is at all?  You ever follow it?  The Bitcoin thing.  Yeah.  It's really hard to follow.  No, I can't.  I can't do basic math.  Well, it's not even that.  We had this guy, Andreas Antonopoulos, explain it to us in very clear terms.  He explained it, but essentially it's got a very set number of Bitcoins that exist.  And so inflation is sort of removed from the equation. 
[03:45:00]  Like the gold standard.  It's sort of similar.  Which I don't understand.  I don't understand either.  But it's all done on computers.  It's all like ones and zeros.  You know, I don't know if it's a good idea.  I don't know if it's a bad idea.  But it seems to be at least a person could.  It's like, we all agree.  Like, you live in a small town.  So I think in a small town you get a better sense of community.  And we kind of all agree that, you know, like if you go to a place and they're selling sandwiches. 
[03:45:30]  Like, how much is the sandwich?  Five bucks?  That sounds right.  That sounds right.  It makes sense.  But if we didn't have money and we had to use some sort of a barter system, we'd still figure out what's worth what.  You know, that's what we would do.  How many sandwiches are available?  Yeah.  But we're trapped in this idea that money is the only way to do it.  Dollars, quarters, fives, twenty.  This is the only way to do it.  But it's not the only way to do it.  If enough fucking people agree to go this Bitcoin route, it's already established. 
[03:46:00]  Like, this is a real possibility.  And everybody's poo-pooing it like it's a joke.  And it is kind of a joke in some ways.  Because, I mean, the Magic the Gathering.  Yeah, you're right.  The Magic the Gathering was the fucking, the big server that went down.  Like, wait a minute, wait a minute.  You had a Magic the Gathering exchange and it became one of the biggest Bitcoin sites in the world?  Like, what the fuck?  Like, Magic the Gathering didn't have the right security.  The whole thing is set up wrong.  You know, winds up losing 350 million plus dollars in Bitcoins. 
[03:46:30]  Like, the direct equivalent of, like, the guy gets robbed.  And everybody who has their money in this exchange just gets fucking robbed.  But it's still going.  It's still going.  See how he can just shut us down?  We want to throw in some fucking smart-ass arms.  But he just gets all smart on us and we have to sit there.  I'm not going to get a smart.  I want you to get goofy.  But this is a fascinating thing in our time.  We're seeing an alternative to dollars.  The first viable alternative.  Everyone goes to, what, internet currency and then someone could easily rob your banks or everything, right? 
[03:47:00]  That's what they're doing with regular money, though.  Or you could just lose your iPhone.  Yeah, but...  An alternative to money?  Hey, I'll put you on the guest list.  You write the number down.  All you have to do is write the number down.  It's not that hard.  Oh, great.  Another currency.  I'm broken.  But it's not that.  There you go.  Hey, good smart-ass barf, sir.  You guys are teaming up on my strategy to introduce new ideas.  You and your ability to retain knowledge. 
[03:47:30]  Rub it in our face.  It's not.  I'll retain knowledge.  I retain information.  So the knowledge of it, the reason why I keep talking about it over and over again,  is that knowledge is not sinking in.  So I don't really get it.  So I talk about it over and over again.  I see your reaction to it, and you're like, whoa, that's fucking crazy.  And then, slowly but surely, it becomes knowledge.  If people talk to me in analogies, then I can get it.  And I try to do that when I'm trying to do a bit that other people might, I'll go, it's  like this. 
[03:48:00]  Okay, if you can make it stupid for me like a kid.  Okay, honey, imagine if you had two apples.  Yeah.  Jimmy stole one of your apples.  Oh, I get it now.  I do that all the time.  I think that's a great way of communicating fucked up ideas.  But even then, I feel like I'm unqualified.  It's important to say it, use the big words, and then go, I mean, it's like this, like this.  So, okay, now you understand the big word I just learned, with the stupidity I needed  to learn it.  Especially if you're on stage, and you're telling a joke. 
[03:48:30]  Because if you do that, you can actually make someone laugh at something they ordinarily  would argue with you about.  Right.  You could just sneak it in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, we're both on the same page.  I love you.  Don't we have some ad copy to read?  I'm just here to do the advertisement.  We're done.  The ad copy's over.  Forever.  Come on.  One more ad?  Do you see that footage of a drone going?  How dare you make me uncomfortable?  In Japan?  A drone?  Yeah, the drone went into the radiation in Japan, and it's just flying around the deserted 
[03:49:00]  cities, and it's so creepy.  Is it glowing?  No, but it hasn't been touched since it happened.  It's really...  Yeah, great, great.  What are you trying to scare the fuck out of me?  The only thing that scares the fuck out of me more than radiation is sharks.  Oh, look at that.  They're like, the radiation's going to kill you in the ocean.  Well, the sharks will kill you first.  How about that?  Do you not swim?  I don't ever bring that up.  Fuck that, dude.  I go in the water up to my waist in Hawaii, and I panic every time. 
[03:49:30]  Because last time I was there, a woman got killed by a shark.  That's real.  Yeah, I know.  It's like, if I was there and a woman got murdered by the werewolf, would you go in the woods?  You'd be like, I'm not going in the fucking woods.  But they're like, hey, you know...  Costa Rica, I'll go in the water.  But no, we're going to Hawaii tomorrow, the next day?  I won't go in the water.  Fuck that.  Those fucking tiger sharks, man.  They're too scary.  Tiger sharks and bull sharks.  Those are the scariest ones.  Do you know that fucking...  The whole movie Jaws was based on something that happened in freshwater?  Oh, the New Jersey thing? 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's freshwater.  It was a river.  Oh, wait, no, that's not the New Jersey thing.  There was a rash of New Jersey shark attacks in the early 1900s.  Yeah, that's it.  It was in a river.  It was not freshwater.  Yeah, it was.  All right.  That's what's fucked.  There's a thing called a bull shark that swims in a freshwater.  They swim so far in freshwater that they saw them in Illinois.  They have them up the Mississippi River in fucking Illinois, a shark that came directly from the ocean.  That's more reason we need stronger immigration policy. 
[03:50:30]  That's why you can't take my guns from a duck, St. Hope.  I literally saw a song.  Build a wall.  Build a fence.  That's what I say.  I literally saw a song the other day that was talking about prying a gun from my cold, dead hands.  That was the song.  It's like, you can come get my gun from my cold, dead hands.  Like, this guy thought about that, wrote it down, said, fuck, and I'm putting this shit on wax.  But you heard it.  Oh, I heard the whole song. 
[03:51:00]  I listened to the whole song.  So someone's putting it out.  Someone's on his side.  There's some, what's the guy's name?  The stapler guy from Office Space that played.  Stephen Root.  If you can't get the fucking reference right away, drop the joke, St. Hope.  Yeah.  Stephen Root.  Man of Constant Starro.  There's a long way to get to this pointless reference.  He played the record guy that's the guys in the thing with the thing, the man of constant sorrow and George Clooney. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  See?  He put it on wax, too.  It wasn't Lee Greenwood, was it?  Yes.  Let's just say yes.  Yeah, whatever, bro.  See, Tom gets what I'm saying.  Almost.  That guy, Lee Greenwood, nothing was happening in his career.  He had that one song, I'm proud to be an American.  Fucking nothing's going on in his career.  And then September 11th happened.  Boom!  His career's on fire!  I always tell Henry Phillips to write a Christmas song.  They're so desperate to have another Christmas song that they will play any fucking thing about Christmas. 
[03:52:00]  They're so desperate to have a Christmas song, they went with the Hanukkah song.  Remember that?  Yeah.  They went with the Hanukkah song.  Every year.  Grandma still got run over by a reindeer fucking 30 years later.  They can't wait to have one more.  Henry Phillips, get off your ass and get a fucking Christmas song.  How about they don't even come up with new Christmas cartoons?  The same fucking cartoons.  The Grinch stole Christmas.  It would be CGI now, and the Grinch would be like crushing villages. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, he'd be evil looking.  He'd be very demonic.  He wouldn't be so sweet and cudgeling.  Well, you saw what they did with Batman.  They could probably do that with the Grinch.  Did you watch the latest Batman?  Mm-mm.  I've never watched the Batman where the tragedy occurred, where those people get shot in Colorado.  For whatever reason, I can't just watch it.  That's the best Batman ever with Christian Bale and what's his name who died.  I've heard it's awesome.  That's the greatest Batman.  I'm done with Batman.  That was the greatest Batman ever.  The Dark Knight?  That's it.  I didn't see it.  Best Batman ever.  Because of what happened in Colorado? 
[03:53:00]  No, no, no.  Nothing.  Too bad that happened.  No, no, no.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm saying the reason I don't watch it is because of that.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, the people in Colorado.  One of the comics from the Comedy Works guy show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Serious business.  Yeah.  Oh, the theater shooting guy.  Yeah, that guy.  Because for whatever reason, that movie's connected in my head.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  I can't just watch that movie.  If I watch that movie, I'll kind of get weirded out.  How does that one shooting weird you out?  I saw it in the theater after that happened, like a few weeks later. 
[03:53:30]  And then you're in the theater thing and you're looking at the fucking exit doors.  I'm not saying it's logical.  I'm just saying.  Oh, I don't go to actual movies.  I saw it at home.  But I had to see it with Bingo.  I can see why the man was traumatized.  I'm not traumatized.  I just chose not to see it because I thought about seeing it a few times and I just kept  getting that thing in my head that a bunch of people fucking died while this movie was  being made.  That's all it is.  I mean, it doesn't make any sense.  I know it doesn't make any sense.  I'm not like arguing the logical, you know, that it makes sense that I have this weird 
[03:54:00]  thing.  I love that while you're saying this, you're slamming ice into your glass.  I know this doesn't make sense, but I just need a drink.  I need a little something to take the edge off.  There's no edge, Doug Stano.  I'm not daring you.  I know it doesn't make any sense.  I'm not defending you.  Why would they ever make another superhero movie?  We've seen another Superman.  I loved Captain America.  They're fun.  They're stupid as fuck.  You know he's going to be alive at the end.  I read the Captain America comic book when I was a kid. 
[03:54:30]  One of the few that I looked at.  And it was the lamest.  Dude, the superhero.  He couldn't fly.  He had to fly on the thing.  And then he had the shield.  He was like the biggest pussy superhero ever.  And then in the late 70s, there was a black character called the Falcon.  All right, I'm out.  Captain America would be getting his ass whooped and his black friend, the Falcon, would come  and save him.  Yeah, well, that's how it usually happens in real life.  You know, you get your ass kicked.  Magical negro.  You call your friend. 
[03:55:00]  But it was cute how they introduced.  He's black and wears a fucking mask.  You're good.  But a black character couldn't get his own comic book.  He had to be introduced.  He had like three pages in Captain America.  He had to be a Marvel.  Marvel was a little bit more bold.  Marvel had Blade.  Blade was a superhero.  He was a black guy.  Nightcrawler.  I'm sure that came out much later.  Nightcrawler.  He wasn't really black.  Well, I guess he was more like...  I was...  I had Roger from What's Happening.  He was geeky, but he was the smart one of his group. 
[03:55:30]  That was the Roger of my social circle.  Captain America was still fun.  I know it was stupid.  I know the premise is stupid, but it's still a fun movie.  Just nonsense.  You're watching nonsense for a couple hours laughing.  You know, having a good time.  Watching spaceships getting shot up by missiles and whatever.  It's stupid, but it's fun.  Nobody got shot.  You can enjoy that one.  Plenty of people got shot.  A lot of people died in Captain America.  No, in a movie theater in Colorado.  Oh, in the premiere.  Oh, did you forget where your heart was at the beginning of this conversation? 
[03:56:00]  I forgot my true loyalty.  This has been the Joe Rogan Experience.  Expand further into the Rogan Universe at JoeRogan.net.  And listen every Saturday at 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. Eastern.
