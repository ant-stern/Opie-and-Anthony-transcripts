<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show covered a wide range of topics throughout the broadcast.  The show began with a scathing critique of Hillary Clinton's DNC speech, focusing on her pantsuit (described with vulgar terms), perceived lack of Obama support, and speculated ambition for a 2012 presidential run.  A caller, "Stryker," provided live updates from the convention, detailing clashes between supporters and excessive partying,  further highlighting the event's ironic "brown" environmental impact despite its "green" goals. The hosts also humorously commented on the ironic death of the author of "100 Things to Do Before You Die."  A lengthy discussion ensued regarding an ACLU lawsuit concerning a sex offender's right to visit parks, sparking outrage and humorous suggestions for managing sex offenders in public spaces.  A 12-year-old caller, "Sid," surprisingly contributed insightful political commentary and lighthearted discussion about his dating life.  The baseball games of the Red Sox, Yankees, and Mets were briefly mentioned.

Next, a caller, Mike from Jersey, shared a harrowing story about his father's pedophilia, its impact on his family, and his subsequent prison sentence for showing his stepsister a tape of his father.  This led to a discussion about inconsistencies in sex crime sentencing, with former police officer Roscoe P. Coltrade providing insight into plea bargaining.  Further calls detailed seemingly disproportionate charges for minor infractions.  The show then mocked Alex Rodriguez's poor Yankee performance, followed by a vulgar and heated exchange with a British caller who disparaged baseball.  A discussion on discontinued Olympic events like live pigeon shooting and the "All Around Dumbbell" event devolved into a barrage of "fuck you"s. Sam Roberts then joined, delivering a highly sexualized and graphic commentary on his top five "gayest" professional wrestling moves, replete with offensive language.

A segment followed mocking a local news story about "Foxy Jackie," who filmed a pornographic video in a public park.  The hosts and guests provided explicit commentary on the video and the woman's appearance, along with discussion of the legal ramifications. A caller recounted a high school experience of nude swinging in a park.  The segment concluded with discussion of a "worst shirt ever" contest, upcoming guests Dana White and Criss Angel, and a mention of Steven Tyler's book.

The hosts then discussed a man's collection of nude photos of young boys and men, deemed "kitsch art," transitioning to a discussion about online pornography, including a bizarre mention of "clown porn."  They discussed an assassination plot against Obama involving meth users,  speculated on John McCain's potential VP choices, and described protesters outside the DNC, including 9/11 conspiracy theorists and environmental activists. Chelsea Clinton's appearance and weight loss were commented upon, along with observations about other political figures' appearances.  A phone call with UFC president Dana White followed, discussing UFC's Olympic potential, Rampage Jackson's legal troubles, upcoming fights (including Chuck Liddell and Kimbo Slice), and confirming Opie and Anthony's invitation to a UFC event in Atlanta.  The segment concluded with further sexually explicit banter, ideas for future on-air content, and a brief review of overrated movies and cringe-worthy past interview moments. A planned future segment on deceased guests was mentioned.

A segment dedicated to overrated movies followed, focusing on *Crash*, *Titanic*, and *Twister*,  with a detailed, humorous, and at times explicit analysis of the homoerotic subtext in *Top Gun*'s volleyball scene, including a clip from a Quentin Tarantino video essay.  A top 10 movie montages list was presented, and a caller, Steve from Jersey, briefly discussed montages and the "Stoner Spelling Bee" segment.  The hosts then played a compilation of uncomfortable interview moments from past shows, featuring The Rock confronting Sick Boy,  tense exchanges with Dax Shepard, Ed Asner, and Robert Clary.  The segment concluded with discussions on bringing back old bits and the possibility of ending the show within two years.

Finally, the show heavily featured reminiscing about "Spaz," recounting his numerous bizarre antics, including his attempts at a "perfectly symmetricized hole" in a safe, Spiderman suit and cow exploits, and behavior at a live broadcast with Steven Lynch and Sammy Hagar.  Spaz's outlandish ideas, some reported in the news, were discussed.  A phone call with Linda Lovelace's sister seeking donations for a memorial fund was handled with significant awkwardness and inappropriate humor.  The hosts teased other cringe-worthy interview segments, including Ed Asner, Kristen Bell, and "Steve the Whistler," and discussed "Mr. DVD" and the spelling of sponsor "Carbo Night."  The segment concluded with the selection of a "Line of the Day" focused on a dance montage ending with a flying pancreas.

[00:00:00]  it's the opie and anthony show opie and anthony radio shock jocks opie and anthony make people  feel good ghosts grow radio bad boys opie and anthony controversial radio personalities opie  and anthony infamous dj's opie and anthony talk show radio hosts opie and anthony opie and anthony  All right, we get it. 
[00:00:30]  I got a piece of the Berlin Wall, and it sat in my apartment for a while, and no one gave a crap.  So guess what? I don't have a piece of the Berlin Wall.  You threw away a piece of history.  Hell yeah, I did.  I've been tired for 12 years.  For the love of God.  I'm doing Al-Qidosis.  Good job.  Well, one time I got a C, the best conduct rate I ever got was a C-, and the teacher wrote in front of this gift next to it.  Gift. 
[00:01:00]  That was nice and flat.  Jimmy.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  This old gag.  Oh, hello, people.  Hi.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  And by the Opie and Anthony show.  So, how did Hillary do last night? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, she, uh...  I kind of know, actually.  She spoke at the Democratic National Convention, and...  Ugh.  Well, she was in a tough spot.  Was she?  Yeah, because most people know that she doesn't like Obama.  She doesn't like Obama.  Yeah.  But she can't come across as being a, uh, you know, a spoiled sport.  She needs unity.  She...  Well...  The party unity. 
[00:02:00]  For herself.  It's all about Hillary.  Like, Hillary, if you read just a little bit about this, she wants to make another, uh...  Run at the presidency in, in 2012.  Of course she does, yeah.  She still wants to be the first female president.  Yeah.  So she...  She has to go up there and do what's right for the party, but she doesn't really believe  in Obama because she believes in herself.  Yep.  So, it was quite interesting, uh, watching the Hillary speech because she had to kind 
[00:02:30]  of, like, toe the line.  She couldn't be too rah-rah, but she couldn't be too, like, F you.  Yeah, the whole goal was for her to get up there and, and convince her delegates, uh, and  her supporters to vote for Obama.  And she got up there, does that half-heartedly, and then just starts going through her own agenda  of what she, you know, she likes, and, and health care, and sharing prosperity, shared  prosperity, she called it, which is, you know, plain old-fashioned communism. 
[00:03:00]  And, uh, yeah, she got up there and, uh, did a little robot speak, which I thought was  nice.  Not as bad as she usually does, though.  No, but when she...  She's toning down the robot speak.  When she threw her support behind Obama and had to say, you know, Barack Obama, it was  pretty robotic.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  And she just, uh, she looks awful.  She made a McCain joke that wasn't even, I don't even know what it was.  What, the new saying? 
[00:03:30]  Is that the new saying?  Is that what you mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, this?  She didn't look that bad.  She's terrible.  TV makeup, and she had the right colors on.  Wow.  You know, that's all calculated.  I heard there was a picture of some person with, like, five pantsuits on the stage trying  to figure out which pantsuit would, uh, look good on set.  Is that true there, Stunt Brain?  Yes, sir.  Early in the afternoon, they caught two guys carrying all these different colored pantsuits  and holding them up on the stage so they could figure out which was going to be the right  color. 
[00:04:00]  Ugh.  Yeah.  Her and her pantsuit.  And now I think she'll go away.  I don't think she'll be seen at the convention for the rest of the week, right?  Unsexiest clothes, uh, ever?  The pantsuit?  The pantsuit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  She'll probably be there tonight for Bill's speech and then disappear.  And then they'll both disappear.  Yeah, because Bill said he's not going to be around for, uh, Obama's big speech when  he goes out there.  No, the Clintons don't believe in Obama like the rest of the Democratic Party.  They believe in Hillary for 2012. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  In a perfect world for Hillary, McCain wins this thing.  Yeah.  This is what I think you were talking about, Ant.  You haven't worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to  suffer through more failed leadership.  No way, no how, no McCain. 
[00:05:00]  What?  No shirt, no shoes, no dice.  She sucks.  What was that?  I don't know.  No way, okay.  I got like a nickel at.  No way, no how, no McCain.  No McCain.  It doesn't rhyme.  It doesn't roll off the tongue.  It's not a clever saying that people are going to remember for years. 
[00:05:30]  They're already saying, though, this is the rallying cry for the rest of the election.  Oh, stop it.  You're going to see signs everywhere.  No way, no how, no McCain.  Yuck.  She wants him to win so badly.  Oh, yeah.  It's so obvious.  Yeah, she doesn't want to give up on her dream.  You know, she has one more shot.  But if Obama gets in and does eight, then you're looking at an old broad.  How old is she now?  They said if Obama did it.  Look at me.  I'm becoming stunt brain with this crap.  They said if Obama did eight years and then she tried again, she'd still be three years 
[00:06:00]  younger than McCain, right?  Three years of.  Yeah.  Well, that's all.  Because McCain.  Didn't she just hit 60?  Yeah.  60, 61.  Somewhere around there.  Oh, that's all dried up.  Wow.  It kind of had the sound of a hostage video at times last night.  You know, you almost could see the gun off to the side.  Yeah, yeah.  And she's reading the note.  Say it.  Give us your delegates.  Yeah, the last thing she wanted to do was give her delegates to Obama last night.  But I got to say, all the papers giving her rave reviews on her speech last night. 
[00:06:30]  Are they or are just the Democrats?  Because I know that her peeps are saying, I was listening to Wins on the way in, and they  were just like, oh my God, it's the best we've ever seen, Hillary.  Yeah.  The best.  And other people are saying she looked like, yeah, she was forced to get out there and  hand over her delegates.  Yes.  All right.  And then Hillary had this to say.  This is terrific. 
[00:07:00]  We're just giving you the silly stuff.  Yeah.  Go to a news station if you want the real important stuff.  To my supporters, to my champions, to my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits.  She's killing.  From the bottom of my heart.  Thank you.  She did a sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits.  Pantsuits. 
[00:07:30]  Yuck.  Yeesh.  The most unsexy thing to wear ever.  That's the movie where you put on a pantsuit, go around, and become an annoying c**t.  Let's say hi to Stryker.  She actually looks sexier in a Yankee hat and a bomb belt.  Stryker.  Stryker. 
[00:08:00]  Stryker.  Help, help.  We're following the Democrats out here.  Help us, please.  Yeah, Stryker's at the convention.  This is our around-the-clock coverage.  We got Stryker from Denver.  Team coverage.  Team coverage with Stryker, live from Denver.  What do you got, Stryker?  Hey, every day on the mall in downtown Denver, the Obama and the Hillary supporters have separate  parades that they meet up at some point, stand up for an argue, tying up traffic, and just 
[00:08:30]  have a verbal shouting match.  It's pissing off so many people down there, it's not even fun.  Huh.  Yeah, these two camps are way too strong.  Yeah.  You know, Hillary's camp is just not willing to give in and let Obama have this thing.  The strip clubs are reporting lots of delegates in attendance, but they're not naming names.  Yeah, yeah, that's what happens.  The places, all the strip clubs and everything, they pack out with all these delegates.  Well, we were talking about this, I think, yesterday. 
[00:09:00]  You don't need these conventions anymore.  You could do this online.  But these people know, hey, this is a great party every year.  You're not taking a great party away from us.  We need to go to these places and go to the strip clubs and go to the bars and get our prostitutes.  Who are you kidding?  It's like the Raccoon Lodge convention.  We'll throw paper bags of water out the window.  There's an orgy going on in Denver this week.  Hey, here's something you guys should get a kick out of.  The mayor here wants to make this the greenest convention ever.  It's actually turned into the brownest convention ever. 
[00:09:30]  They've closed off the streets by parking semis and dump trucks there.  And the trucks are idling 24 hours a day.  Burning diesel left and right and spilling all kinds of carbon in the air and they don't care.  They're just like, well, we've got to do something.  Well, that green thing is such a joke.  They want it to be the greenest convention ever.  Well, you know how you accomplish that?  Tell everyone to stay home.  Don't have one.  Less people flying.  Less people getting rented cars.  You can turn off the electricity in that dumb Denver stadium or wherever the hell they are. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, that would truly be a green convention.  Do it online.  Yeah.  And then Hillary did a little of this.  We just got a few clips here of Hillary at the convention last night.  For an America again that will join with our allies in confronting our shared challenges  from poverty and genocide to terrorism and global warming.  Most of all, I ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years. 
[00:10:30]  Claude Rains.  Those are the reasons I ran for president and those are the reasons I support Barack Obama for president.  I support Barack Obama.  What's wrong with her?  I like the fact that you said Claude Rains and not even the invisible man.  No.  Just because Claude Rains is obviously on the tip of everybody's tongue.  Of course.  Everyone knows Claude Rains is the invisible man. 
[00:11:00]  A 60-year-old movie reference.  Yeah, it's too early for 60-year-old movie references, Ant.  Let's say hi to Glenn in Oklahoma.  Glenn?  I think Hillary would really love to trade in that pantsuit for a Supreme Court justice.  You're not going to find many Hillary fans on this radio show, but I think she's got a career in this political thing.  Yeah.  I think she's going to be doing something big, real big. 
[00:11:30]  I think she's going to just come up short every time, no matter what she does.  She's got too much baggage in that husband, Bill.  He doesn't support her in what she does.  He cheated on her.  She's got that baggage.  You don't think Bill supports her?  She's getting older.  No, Bill doesn't even like her.  If Bill wasn't supporting Hillary, he would be, like, living in the Caribbean right now, having a lot of those frozen drinks in between native broads. 
[00:12:00]  Here's what I think.  This was her shot at the presidency.  Right.  Him backing her and just being there for her was his payback for what he did.  Right.  And now...  I like that.  All bets are off.  I like that.  The second this whole thing blows over and she no longer is running for...  Well, she's not running for president, but it's done.  Any day now, Bill is going to announce that he's just leaving the country and going to hang out at hedonism or something.  Oh, I like that.  Is that going to Jamaica, smoke some pot, get some dark women? 
[00:12:30]  I'm sure we'll know by the end of the year.  We'll know by the end of the year.  Yeah.  And then Hillary had this to say.  And he knows that government must be about we the people, not we the favored few.  And when Barack Obama is in the White House, he'll revitalize our economy, defend the working people of America, and meet the global challenges of our time.  Democrats know how to do this. 
[00:13:00]  As I recall, we did it before with President Clinton and the Democrats.  She sounds so fake.  I know the Democrats did it before.  Oh, shit.  What is this sing-songy little thing she's doing that is so insincere?  Rachel, Obama, you've come back.  Obama, you're black.  This was the hardest thing she's had to do in her career, I believe. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, well, second hardest.  You know, sitting down Chelsea might have been a tough one back in the day.  Sid, New York, what's going on?  Conceiving Chelsea was probably tough for her.  Oh, a man.  You have to do what?  Where?  All right, but only once.  That's an exit, not an entry.  Oh, I don't even think Bill could try that one.  Yeah.  Huh?  I don't even think Bill could have tried that.  Uh-uh. 
[00:14:00]  You stay away from there!  No problem.  I barely want to do it with the real one.  Sid, what do you got?  Hey, um, I just can't really wrap my head around, like, I mean, she lost her delegates.  She lost a percentage of the vote.  I mean, I don't understand why she's so enthusiastic about her, you know, her opposition winning.  I mean, she lost.  I don't know why she's still...  Sid, how old are you? 
[00:14:30]  I'm 12.  Yeah, first of all, I hate you, because you sound way smarter than I.  Secondly, no, actually, she, uh, she, uh, die, uh.  She, bar!  Said she had no choice.  She was in a tough position last night.  She doesn't want to be rah-rah for Obama, but she has to.  Or the party's going to look at her like, oh, you're just a sore loser.  Traitor to the party.  Right, and we can't support you in 2012.  That's what that whole thing was about last night.  And if she doesn't do the right thing, young Sid, and McCain wins, the party will not 
[00:15:00]  forget her disloyalty in four years when it would be her legitimate shot to run.  That's right, exactly.  Sid, how fast can you throw a ball?  How fast can I throw a ball?  Yeah.  Yeah, baseball.  Um, I honestly have no idea.  You're not into sports, are you?  No, not really.  Yeah, you can tell by the way you're talking about politics.  What about the girls?  You like girls?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's good.  Good, you'll forget all about politics and everything else once you, uh, what they call 
[00:15:30]  hook up.  Who do you want, Sid, to win the election?  What?  Who do you want to win the election?  Obama.  Really?  Why do you want Obama?  Because, uh, the kids at school are talking about Obama?  What do you got on it?  No, it's just, I really feel that McCain would just, would just not really run this country  well.  I mean, he'd just spend more money on the war and then we'd fall deeper into this economical  standpoint and it would suck.  It would suck indeed, Sid.  That's what Sid's saying, it would suck. 
[00:16:00]  He's got his thoughts together for a 12-year-old, though.  Eh.  Sid's, uh, Sid's correct, I think.  Uh, do you think that McCain's too old to be running for office, Sid?  Um, well, I don't think he's too old, but he's not exactly, um, ripe.  He's no spring chicken.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I kind of agree with Sid.  I think Sid has a grandfather that's younger than McCain, right, Sid?  For sure.  Uh, yeah. 
[00:16:30]  When, when does school start?  Um, in a week, in like two days.  Doesn't that suck?  Yeah.  Like, didn't summer fly by?  I hated that as a kid.  It's like, ugh, back to school.  God, that sucks.  I think Sid is one of those rare cases, though, where he looks forward to school.  Do you like school?  He counts down the days all summer long.  Let me tell you, let me tell you a little something about your pal, Anthony.  Never graduated.  Very successful.  Don't even bother with school.  That's what, that's what your pal, Anthony, says. 
[00:17:00]  It's a waste of time.  But he has other issues, Sid.  He's got a lot of issues, this kid.  Stay away from the school.  When I say kid, I mean Anthony.  Do you have a girlfriend, Sid?  Are you working on one?  Uh, yeah.  Oh, what, uh, tell me about her.  Um, she's been a bit confusing lately, but.  Hey, getting used to that, huh?  Oh, boy.  Let me tell you, kid.  That don't change.  How confusing is it?  A little confusing.  What's she doing there, Sid?  Um, sort of just like, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no. 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  It starts at 12?  It starts at 12.  Dude, dude, just get used to it.  It never ends.  It never ends.  That sucks.  That sucks.  Why don't you get yourself a younger lady?  Younger lady.  Maybe someone, you know, kindergarten.  I think an eight-year-old at some point doesn't argue.  Yeah.  You won't get the yes, no, yes, no.  Barbie, you give her a Barbie doll and everything's fine.  If I was you, I'd hang outside the preschool. 
[00:18:00]  It's legal, bro.  And I feel like a pedophile.  Well.  Well, you're 12, though.  You're a kid, too.  You're all right.  What is she yesin' and noin' about?  Like, what?  And you just go like, oh.  Just like, the whole thing, you know?  Like, she wants to go to a movie, and now she doesn't.  Now she does.  Now she doesn't.  Yes, it's a yes, and then she doesn't show up.  Never let them pick the movie either, Sid.  Their taste in movies stinks.  12-year-old chick flick?  Like, what'd you have to see, that Miley Cyrus garbage? 
[00:18:30]  Oh, my God.  I hate her so much.  I love this kid.  This kid is a 12-year-old adult.  Sid's smart.  He realizes that that broad's about 28 years old.  Make him believe she's 15, 16 years old.  So you want a nice, you want to go see something like The Dark Knight or whatever it is you want  to see, and she wants to just go see that dreck that women tend to like?  Yeah.  What was the last movie she dragged you to, Sid?  Um, the last one was Iron Man, which wasn't actually too bad.  Iron Man.  That's pretty good.  You know, they're saying that was the best movie of the summer. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Wait, she dragged you to that, or you dragged her?  Uh, it was sort of like a neither, neither.  We just, it was really the only one playing.  Okay.  I picked a movie.  Yeah.  What, do you sit together?  You put your little arm around her and stuff in the movie theater?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's nice.  I got a little trick with you.  Do you do it with the popcorn?  You ever hear this one?  You ever hear a trick with the popcorn?  I'll tell you about it someday. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  It's pretty fun.  We'd get thrown off the radio if we told you.  Yes.  But if you meet us outside the radio station, we get thrown off the radio station.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll fill you in on the popcorn.  Sure.  All right, Sid.  Good observations about this election thing.  Sid, feel free to call in anytime.  Yeah, we like it.  You're the official kid of the Opie and Anthony show.  There you go.  And hockey season comes around.  Opie will take you to a game.  Yeah.  You want to go?  Sure.  All right.  You're there, sir.  Well, thanks.  It will never happen. 
[00:20:00]  All right, Sid.  Take it easy, Sid.  There you go, Sid.  One more clip from Hillary.  There is no chasm too deep, no barrier too great, no ceiling too high.  For all who work hard, who keep going, have faith in God, in our country, and each other.  That is our mission, Democrats.  Let's elect Barack Obama and Joe Biden for that future worthy of our great country.  Thank you.  God bless you.  And Godspeed. 
[00:20:30]  Godspeed.  You know, it's fantastic.  The second you attain what she just talked about, no ceiling too high, none of this, this country's great, blah, blah, blah.  The second you attain that, the same Democrats that are preaching this bull will rape you.  They will rape you of whatever success you have made of yourself in this country.  So don't even, don't buy her crap.  Oh, her and Obama. 
[00:21:00]  Everyone's going to be so well off in this country under Obama.  Stop it.  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hi.  Hillary speaking on behalf of Obama kind of put me in mind of the scene in Godfather 2 where the congressman is speaking at the Corleone.  Vito Corleone.  Some of my best friends are Italian-Americans. 
[00:21:30]  The politician.  Boy, was he in touch.  He got really lippy in the office.  And then he wakes up with a bloody prostitute next to him.  Yeah.  And who's there to help?  Tom.  Good old Tom.  But we might need a little favor from you.  He got a little lippy.  He certainly did.  Well, they didn't really negotiate.  We'd like to do this.  No.  All right.  Well, here's a little drug in your drink.  Dead hooker next to you.  Now what?  Slick?  Some of my best friends are Italian-Americans. 
[00:22:00]  Italian-Americans.  Anthony Vito Corleone.  He messed up her name.  He called her instead of K.  What did he call her?  Did he say Kate or?  Kate.  Yeah.  Kate.  Sure.  All right.  We're at our first break.  There you go.  Hey.  There's our political break.  Yeah.  We'll give you a little politics.  I'm going to talk about porn next.  Nice.  There's a nice video that's on TV right now. 
[00:22:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Did you see the one?  I've never.  What?  Did you see the undotted version that the news had?  I only saw the dotted version.  The black dot is almost as big as the entire TV screen.  The entire screen.  We'll talk about it next.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  I want to say good morning to Boston this morning.  Big win for the Red Sox last night.  Coming down here to New York and kicking the Yankees ass. 
[00:23:00]  What was the final?  Seven to three.  Red Sox over the Yankees.  And your boy A-Rod there, Anthony.  Because you're a Yankee fan.  My boy A-Rod.  Well, you're a Yankee fan.  So I say you're a big A-Rod fan.  Your boy A-Rod went.  He had a good game last night.  He went 0 for 5, hit it to two double plays, and got booed by everybody in attendance at  the game last night.  Mr. Clutch didn't do it when they needed him to?  Yeah, he's usually there.  He's the worst when your team needs you. 
[00:23:30]  April, April, when the Yankees are down 14-1.  He had a two-run shot in the seventh.  Man, a eight-bomb.  0 for 5.  Hitting it to two double plays.  That's a good one.  That's a good game for A-Rod.  When they need him most.  Yeah.  What are they, what, six games out?  Something like that?  Five or six games out of the wild card position?  There you go.  We had a death overnight, too.  Huh? 
[00:24:00]  Well, one of the important things to do if you're doing morning radio is to tell everyone  about the latest death.  You're kidding!  We get to tell people first.  How did it happen?  Before they turn on their computers and their iPhones and listen to the all-news radio station.  Mm-hmm.  You know that book, A Hundred Things to Do Before You Die?  Yeah.  The author died.  What number was he up to?  I think they figured out that he did half of the hundred things. 
[00:24:30]  He was only halfway through the hundred things to do before you die.  That's because he screwed up.  Number 50 was die.  Yeah.  He should have had 50 a little later in the, I mean, he should have had that one a little  later in the book is what you're saying?  Yes.  That should be the last page.  That should be the last thing.  Yeah, the last page.  Now die.  He was only 47.  And he had nothing wrong with him until he fell and hit his head on what?  The edge of a shower door or something? 
[00:25:00]  It was some kind of glass door.  Some kind of, like, I don't know if it was a patio door or something, but...  With the metal groove?  Yeah.  At the bottom, you think?  That little metal track at the bottom.  And that's all they know.  He just kind of fell, hit his head.  And it's over, Johnny, for the author of 100 Things to Do Before You Die.  Wow.  47 years old.  Didn't he put his hands up to stop himself or did he just, what, did he fall like a soldier?  Just hands to the sides?  Dope.  I don't know.  He just ended up with his head cracking on there and that was it. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Good night.  By the way, he died August 17th, so 10 days later we finally hear about it.  What were some of the things he suggested before he died?  Like the 100 things?  To play...  Pad all of your sliding glass door tracks.  That's a one-on-one thing.  Should have been one, yeah.  Oops.  Stunt break.  Yeah, he had the usual stuff like running with the bulls at Pamploma and going to the  Oscars, but he also said you should try the original bungee jumping.  You know, going to those jungles where they actually use the elastic... 
[00:26:00]  Oh, the vines?  Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah, that's a good one.  But stuff like that.  He was an adventure travel writer before he came up with this.  Why should you try it with the vines when there's probably better ropes you can get here?  That's a good point.  Wouldn't hurt as much.  Yeah.  Like rip your leg out, those things.  I've seen that.  Just see that on National Geographic.  Make the National Geographic.  Well, we got this quote today.  It's incredibly ironic, someone dying so young who wrote about doing things before you die. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  So...  How come Mr. Obvious never gets a promotion?  His name was David Freeman.  He's been a captain for so many years.  You'd think by now they'd promote him.  Well, he actually became Lieutenant Douche.  Oh, they busted him down to Lieutenant Douche.  Yeah.  Captain.  He should be, I don't know, major obvious.  I think you're making a good point there.  I'm going to call him Colonel Obvious now.  He's Colonel Obvious. 
[00:27:00]  Carl in Philly, how are you?  Hey, yo.  What's up?  Hey, Carl.  Didn't mention the Mets game last night.  Prank caller!  Prank caller!  You want a cellular phone?  Brian in Philly, what's up?  Yo!  Hey.  Let's go, Mets go!  Let's go, Mets go!  Another prank caller!  Let's go, Mets go!  What was the final?  Worst song ever.  It was a bad one for the Mets last night.  Yeah, a little extra inning loss.  They were leading 7-0 at one point. 
[00:27:30]  And blew it!  They blew it in extra innings.  Hey, man.  Everyone knows I'm a Mets fan.  It's up to you to bring up how awful the Mets were last night.  I have no problem bringing up how bad the Yankees were last night.  8-7 in 13 innings.  They did blow a 7-0 lead.  Yikes.  Yeah, that's a good one, though.  The Mets and the Phillies are battling it out right now.  And, of course, yeah, the Yankees losing.  They're not even going to make the wild card spot. 
[00:28:00]  They're just horrid this year.  What kind of fan are you?  It's just one of those, you know, Jimmy's right when he talks about them hiring these geriatric players just because they got a name.  And not farming some of the young kids up and teaching them and building a team.  They'd rather spend waste years than they could be spending getting young guys and making them good ballplayers.  And they spend those years just spending more money trying to buy the big stars that will put the asses in the seats. 
[00:28:30]  But you guys act like every other team is working their farm system.  Maybe the Yankees are the worst, but in this day and age, you've got to get a winner right away.  And there's too much at stake, so they go for the big trades.  You know what, though?  Yeah, get a winner right away.  They can't do that either.  They're spending all kinds of money, and they're picking people up, and it doesn't seem to help.  It hasn't worked.  I mean, what worked for them was when they let the young players develop and then slowly work them in. 
[00:29:00]  And when they brought on a young man by the name of Derek Jeter.  Yeah, I remember hearing about him when he was still in the farm system before he played,  when it was like whoever they had before him, Mariano Duncan and somebody else.  Did you try to get an autograph then and was shunned by him?  Way to hurt so much feelings.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Why I brought that up.  I know it's a sore spot.  But also, baseball decided to do the instant replay.  Is it official?  Starting what, tomorrow?  Tomorrow night they're using instant replay for what, home runs? 
[00:29:30]  Home runs only right now, I guess.  But that's the easiest call, isn't it?  I know.  Oh, it's out of the – oh, wait, no, it isn't.  That's pretty much it.  It's either a home run or it's not.  Why do they insist on having the instant replay for home run calls?  I don't get that.  Yeah.  I think because the umpires probably fight it.  The unions probably fight it.  And they probably were willing to give in only on that one because it's such an obvious  blown call.  There's no judgment with it.  Like with a strike and a ball or safe and out is a judgment call in a way. 
[00:30:00]  A home run is black or white.  Right center field.  McClouth is back to the track.  He leaps at the wall and it is gone.  It just cleared.  No.  What do they say now?  Two, they're saying it's a double.  It went just under the wall.  But how do you make that mistake?  Yeah.  Under the wall or over the wall?  Over the wall.  When it's under, it bounces off.  Right.  When it's over, it's gone.  There goes Holiday.  He's on the track.  He's at the wall.  She's gone.  The milkman delivered. 
[00:30:30]  Now, what are they saying?  They're taking the milk back.  That's my favorite.  What are they saying?  What are they saying?  It's you saying it.  So, what are you saying, sir?  Hey, looking good, sports fans.  Those Beltran back to the warning track right near the wall.  Leaping and he made the catch.  Carlos Beltran right.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  My apologies.  I thought he had it.  I thought he had it, too.  He acted as though he had it. 
[00:31:00]  He did not have it.  I love the other guy.  I thought he had it, too.  He acted as though he had it.  So, it's his fault.  Rachel, I have it.  I guess they do need it for the instant replay.  It was like during McGuire's home run race, he actually hit one that didn't count.  Yeah.  Really?  They're like, the thing is, home run calls, yeah, they make a mistake every so often,  but it's not like they just don't acknowledge it.  I think it's the close plays at the bases.  At home plate.  At home plate. 
[00:31:30]  Hey, let a guy run out of ground ball every once in a while and make a mistake, whatever.  But the close plays at home, come on.  Close plays.  They should use it.  I mean, the bottom line is, if umpires are not doing their, it'll also make them do their  jobs better if they know that every play can be reviewed.  If you've got the technology, you should be using it.  Like the Olympics, we all learned that they really upped the technology in the Olympics  this time around.  And I was telling Anthony before the show, I believe that you could have a major league  game without umpires at this point.  Yeah, just electronically monitor everything. 
[00:32:00]  You've got to have a guy that's working the equipment, but I think you could pretty much  do a game without umpires.  Sensors on uniforms, shoes, bases.  Mitts.  Things like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Even probably, while we were discussing the strike zone, then I think Jimmy brought up  the point that, you know, obviously the strike zone is different for every player because  of their height.  But I think...  You work that into the program.  But then Anthony said, yeah, you just pop in their height into the master computer and  then they can figure out the strike zone that way. 
[00:32:30]  Well, it's also their stance.  Because if a guy squats over more, his strike zone changes.  Yeah.  So maybe that might be a little tougher.  But they can probably do it though.  They take a quick graph of you.  Well, they have sensors in the uniforms that wherever your midsection is, your strike zone,  it'll be able to tell the master computer where the strike zone is.  But then you're going to have guys, like, just touching their nipples to their knees  so there's no strike zone.  Yeah, that's true. 
[00:33:00]  What, Danny?  A little comment?  Comment, Danny?  They could, you know, they motion capture these guys for all these video games that  are out now.  So, I mean, they, you know, and the strike zone changes on them when you're playing.  So they just implement that.  So make them look all goofy with the ping pong balls on them for a while.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And then you don't need them anymore.  Mm-hmm.  I say we just play video game baseball.  Have them just sit down and play video game baseball.  That would rule.  You get to watch it on TV.  That would rule. 
[00:33:30]  Matt in Virginia, what's up?  I was just going to say, if you put instant replay on those games, they're going to be  eight hours long.  That's true though, yeah.  You have a limit, I think, is how many you can use maybe.  And maybe there's certain sets of circumstances which it can be used under.  Baseball's so long anyway.  Now you're just throwing in another way to delay things.  But they should make it interesting for the people that are going to the game.  Basically, let's say the other team uses an instant replay.  Mm-hmm.  And it's determined that they shouldn't have used the instant replay.  Oh, yeah.  That the call was correct. 
[00:34:00]  Then the other team gets to kill one of your players.  Kill.  Right on the mound in front of everybody.  Your choice how you want to kill them too.  Hey, before we wrap up our sports break, we applaud a sport that no one watches.  But they're doing the right thing.  The LPGA.  Ooh.  The LPGA starting, I believe, next year.  Yep.  You can't be in the LPGA if you don't speak English. 
[00:34:30]  That's what we need in America.  Wow, that's a bold move.  Well, the LPGA is being taken over by a lot of foreign lady golfers.  And the LPGA in general has had it.  Mm-hmm.  And they're basically saying, if you can't speak English, we don't want you here.  Good.  How great is that?  Wow.  Because of all sports, the one you need to talk the least is golf.  They're doing a ball hole walk.  Yeah.  What do they need to talk about? 
[00:35:00]  Well, I think what happens is when your top players don't speak English, it's really tough  to market the sport.  Oh, okay.  Is that why they have a problem?  You're not getting the interviews out there to America and the commercials and everything  else you do.  Or is it the fact that they're all lesbians?  Yeah, they've got to hotten up.  They've got to get that sport a little hotter.  You sexy up that game.  Anything else on that, or is that pretty much it?  Stump, right?  I miss Nancy Lopes.  Lopes. 
[00:35:30]  Is that her name?  Lopez.  Lopez.  I don't know.  It seems to me there's going to be a bunch of contests against this.  They're going to sue and say no, no, no.  But yeah, the LPGA says you're going to have to take a verbal test in order to be allowed  to play in the tournaments.  And I wonder, who's going to be given this test?  They really seem to happen after the Asian invasion.  The top ten golfers, I think five or six of them, this year in the LPGA were all from  Korea and the Asian area.  I enjoy golf, and I just thought it was the same player winning week after week. 
[00:36:00]  That's not true?  No.  Oh, all right.  I had no idea.  I thought there was some kind of a great woman golfer out there, but no.  I thought we had the female version of Tiger Woods, but I'm mistaken.  There's many different golfers winning every week.  Why wouldn't they just market it in Asia then?  I mean, there's more Asians than the other white people.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure they are, because that Yao Ming has made basketball huge in China.  Because, oh, my God. 
[00:36:30]  Although they'd rather wear a Kobe Bryant jersey than a Yao Ming jersey in China.  Thank God for the redeem team.  It rhymes.  That was a bore fest.  Of course.  Hey, we're going to watch this one closely, though, because I'm sure the public, you know,  the, what's the word I'm looking for?  Yeah, the special interest groups are going to be coming out of the woodwork on this.  How dare you do this?  They'll say it's racist.  It's racist.  Yeah.  David, Kansas City.  Good morning, boys.  Mm-hmm.  Hey, I'm going to bust Jimmy a little bit.  Jimmy, when did Jerry Maguire try to get the home run record? 
[00:37:00]  Oh, did I say Jerry Maguire?  Jerry Maguire.  Did I really say that?  These asses don't miss anything.  It's too early for us to be accurate.  Jerry Maguire.  I meant to say, I meant to say Mark, but I said Jerry because I'm sweet.  I love the listeners that just let us, you know, make our little mistakes because they  understand out there, okay, you meant Mark Maguire or whatever.  But, no, can't let it by. 
[00:37:30]  Steve, California.  Hey, boys.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  Oh, hi, buddy.  Hey, the guy that called about the instant replay on the baseball taking too long and  making it boring, it's not done by the officials at the ballpark.  It's done at a central location set up by Major League Baseball, and one umpire's doing it.  And he makes, that's how they're doing it.  It's not done on the field like football.  Oh, so, uh, what the hell does that mean? 
[00:38:00]  It's still going to take some time, isn't it?  Sure.  No, no.  They're going to have the same thing where they get one or two views, and that's it.  And it's done instantaneously from a central location.  All right.  It'll take less than 40 seconds.  Well, we'll see about that.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  I mean, that's what you say.  I don't agree.  Eh, whatever.  You know, when you go to a sporting event and they go to the instant replay,  it's kind of exciting, though, as you're sitting there wondering,  oh, my God, are they going to turn around the call?  What's going to happen?  And then they do, and the whole place, ah! 
[00:38:30]  One more thing about sports.  Under ordinance is being challenged in the Jeffersonville courtroom this afternoon.  It involves the case of Eric Dottle, a convicted sex offender,  who wants to be allowed to visit that city's parks.  Eric Dottle's son plays sports, and he wanted to be allowed to go to the games.  Earlier this month, a judge ruled that based on his past convictions,  Dottle continues to be a threat to the community and denied his request to go to local parks.  Now the ACLU is getting involved. 
[00:39:00]  Well, this sign right here that says it is unlawful for sex offenders to enter the park  is in every Jeffersonville public park, but the ACLU says it's unconstitutional.  They say once an offender has paid their debt to society,  they should have the same rights as everyone else.  But the city attorney says the city has every right to make this a rule.  But myself, I feel more comfortable with those type, not around.  By those types, Al Thompson means sex offenders. 
[00:39:30]  Currently, Jeffersonville prohibits sex offenders from entering public parks.  But that could change.  The ACLU argued in court today that any ordinance to keep anyone out of a public place is unconstitutional.  So what do you think?  I think the ACLU are idiots.  I think they should open their houses to sex offenders.  Let them play with their children in their houses.  Why not? 
[00:40:00]  This is something they say because they paid their debt.  If they go to jail, they serve their time and then get out, that that's it.  But the rate of...  What's the word I'm looking for?  Stuntbrain?  Thank you.  Stuntbrain knows that.  Jimmy knew that, too.  You got it out there.  The rate of racism...  It's got a C, a D, a V, and a...  It's a crazy word.  Among sex offenders is worse than any other crime.  These guys just keep doing...  There's no fixing it by putting them in jail. 
[00:40:30]  So they get out and this guy wants to go to a park.  He's going to see little kids and lose his mind.  The right of society, I think, overweighs it.  I remember I was in high school.  I was...  We took a little socialized test.  Mr. Anderson was my teacher and I asked him a legal question.  Mr. Anderson.  I said, what if someone...  We were talking about license plates and stuff.  You had the right to put your last name on a license plate.  So I said, what if somebody's last name spelled out profanity?  If that's their legitimate last name...  Right.  Would they be allowed...  Would they be afforded the same rights to put their name on a license plate? 
[00:41:00]  And he was basically like, no, because the right of society to not...  You know what I mean?  To have profanity sometimes overrides the individual...  Right.  Right, yeah.  Yeah, however you phrase it.  I mean, it was 30 years ago, but 20.  That's ridiculous, though.  The ACLU should just...  I don't know.  Stick to other stuff.  What if you build a special cage?  Uh, sex offender cage.  Sex offender special cage.  Special cage where they can... 
[00:41:30]  Escort into the cage, watch your son play, and then escort it out of the cage back to  That'll be great.  They'll all look like multiple Migs just throwing stuff out of the cage at the children.  And you give him, like, a 15-minute head start.  He has to leave the parking lot 15 minutes before anyone else.  Yeah.  And the problem...  They have, like, for a certain level of sex offenders, I mean, it's just all sex offenders.  Not going into a park is kind of stupid, but it should be for...  Is it?  I would like to know what this guy did. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Is it a Gary Glitter crime, or what are we talking here?  Yeah, was it a sexual...  What's it called?  There's a difference between rape and, I think, sexual misconduct.  I think sexual misconduct is like, if you're on a date and you start, and she goes, come  on, stop, and you go with it anyway, I think that's not classified as a rape.  That's more classified as sexual misconduct.  Really?  Because sometimes when girls say stop, they mean go.  And that's the confusion us guys have sometimes.  Well, it's like the kid was saying when he called before, yes, no, yes, no.  Right.  You don't know.  Yeah, it's all a big maybe.  It's very confusing.  Are you all right with this?  No, no, no. 
[00:42:30]  All right, I'll stop.  No, yes, yeah.  What?  Hey, you got the locals involved in this story.  Oh.  I'm sure they got something good.  This is our favorite part of news stories, when the locals get involved.  Let's see what the local people, the regular Joes, have to say about this.  What do you think?  What do you think they're going to say?  I think they're going to be outraged.  Really?  Yes.  Why not ban people who have been convicted of littering in the past, or convicted of drunk  driving in the past, or convicted of injuring their children physically in the past,  or convicted, et cetera, et cetera? 
[00:43:00]  Ken Falker believes that Eric Dahl, the man at the root of this debate,  is no longer required to register as a sex offender, so the state of Indiana must not  consider him dangerous.  Opie, could you pause that?  Opie, could you pause that?  Opie's hitting pause.  Oh, it won't.  Oh, no.  Opie, could you pause that?  Not.  Oh, boy.  It was ignoring him.  Yeah.  What?  Stretch first.  Oh, boy.  Is it possible it could be the DVD?  We haven't had problems with that one yet. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  All right, I'll sit back down.  I would give that one another day in court.  Yeah.  But we need to know what's going on.  Give it the benefit of the doubt.  You sure?  I think there's some ghosts in the machine.  All right, hold on, man.  Now we've got to do this and move it over here.  What were you saying?  Somebody was saying something about that?  The whole analogy this guy's making where you're not allowed in a park,  and obviously this is an ACLU guy, if you're convicted of drunk driving.  And littering.  Did he say drunk?  The first one was littering.  Yeah, littering.  The second one was drunk driving.  Drunk driving. 
[00:44:00]  Well, a lot of times, if you're convicted of drunk driving, they take away your license.  Right.  So, yeah, if you're a sex offender, you can still drive.  It's called, you know, there's a certain crime, and then there's consequences that go along with that certain crime.  So, if you're a sex offender, dropping you into a place where there's a bunch of children, it's probably not a good idea.  Because the alternate, they talk about the punishment suiting the crime.  The punishment, okay, if you don't want that, how about this? 
[00:44:30]  Life imprisonment for most sex offenders, because, like you said, the recidivism rate is so high.  How about we protect ourselves by just keeping them in jail for the rest of their life?  If we're going to let them out, we should have certain parameters that they have to live by to walk among us.  I mean, how does the ACLU, they just completely ignore common sense sometimes.  Yeah.  They think they are just champions of the Constitution when, I don't know, they're really not irrelevant.  A lot of the ACLU cases exist just to make them money, because if they win the case, they get to bill all their hours, and the government has to pay it. 
[00:45:00]  And that's why a lot of these dumb cases, you go, why would the ACLU take that?  It's just to make money.  Nice.  All right, let's get to the local angle here on this story.  Ken Falk argues that Eric Dowdell, the man at the root of this debate, is no longer required to register as a sex offender,  so the state of Indiana must not consider him dangerous.  And merely because you committed an offense years ago doesn't mean you're at risk of injuring someone. 
[00:45:30]  But Dowdell has a criminal record that includes domestic battery.  Most recently, he's charged with domestic battery and strangulation.  I'm not going to comment on what is or is not pending, but he has no, that has no relevance.  Dowdell has asked the judge to exempt him from this rule, but the judge said no.  Before his parents and grandparents go, you don't want to have to worry about something like that or your kids, you know.  You want a safe place for them to be.  If I knew he was here, I wouldn't bring her.  I don't want them to feel comfortable bringing my kids to a park when there's a registered sex offender. 
[00:46:00]  Well, obviously.  What do they do?  The sex offense you commit matters.  Yeah.  To me, it matters.  What would be a situation where you would be classified and jailed as a sex offender?  You get out, but it would be okay.  Let me think.  Yeah, that's what I was wondering, Jimmy.  Is there something?  I don't, rape, as awful a crime as rape is, I don't know what the likelihood is somebody will do it more than once. 
[00:46:30]  I mean, I don't know.  Maybe it's likely they'll keep doing it.  I would love to know, like, if you get convicted of that and you get out, do most of them re-offend or not?  Pedophiles always do.  I mean, they're just, they're just, they're vermin.  I mean, they always re-offend.  I say let the guy go to the park because, you think the fathers out there are going to let this guy sit around a park while their kids are playing in the league?  He's going to get a beating every time he goes to the park.  Throw him a beating.  Yeah, he's allowed to go to the park, but he has to wear, like, a bright yellow pantsuit and top hat. 
[00:47:00]  So everybody knows who he is.  Yeah, it's a top hat.  Wow, the phones are lit.  They want to talk about this.  We'll talk about this next.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, got to go right to the phones.  877-212-0&A.  Where were we before the break there, Anthony?  Oh, my God.  We were talking about a case where the ACLU has taken on the cause of sex offenders.  And they say they should be allowed in public parks. 
[00:47:30]  There's a park that has a sign up there that says no sex offenders allowed.  And the ACLU is saying, hey, they paid their debt to society.  They went to prison, whatever.  They're out.  And it's unconstitutional to put any other penalties on them.  And other people are saying, you know, you're dropping these people, these predators, into a virtual Disney World for pedos at a public park.  So therein lies the little argument. 
[00:48:00]  We did all that before the break?  Yeah, amazing, isn't it?  We're going to learn something about sex offenders today, believe it or not.  Yeah.  I think we're going to learn a little something, something.  We start with Chris in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Chris, how are you today?  How are you doing, guys?  Good.  Basically, my girlfriend, someone who she went to school with, has to register as a sex offender.  He was drunk or something, decided he had to go take a piss, you know, pick the tree or something, you know, went to the bathroom.  There were some kids around, had to go to court for it, and now has to register as a sex offender. 
[00:48:30]  All right, you got dumped out of it.  Let's just say this.  Your girlfriend's friend from school had to go to the bathroom and get to the outdoors, and kids saw him, and he had to register now.  Yeah, I mean, we've all done the, you know, outdoor thing.  You've got to be really careful where you're doing that.  And the fact when no one's.  Really careful.  Even if you're really just trying to, you know, relieve yourself.  You've got to be really careful, or you could be a sex offender for that. 
[00:49:00]  Which is ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  We're not talking about that, dude.  What are the people that do these weird things that are classified as sex offenses that no one is talking about?  Yeah, I'd love a couple of examples of that.  What?  Because I know what public.  Well, that's what we got.  Relieving yourself in public, I think, is, depending on who can see it, I think you get put in that category of sex offender. 
[00:49:30]  If you, you know, you go out to relieve yourself out of your car in front of an elementary school, it's going to be a problem.  Yeah.  If you're just in the woods, Uncle Paul, did you have a problem like that once?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I think a lot of people don't realize that.  Little Mary saw me.  Little towel, Kelly.  Towel.  I said, keep it under your hat.  That's a diuretic I had.  It's a diuretic.  But if you're just pulling off the side of the parkway or something like that and you go and a cop pulls behind you. 
[00:50:00]  How about a school bus drives by as you're doing that?  Well.  And a cop's right behind the school bus, so he sees school bus and then he sees you to the side of the road.  If you're waving at the bus at the time, there's probably a problem.  If you're in the woods off the highway or maybe next to the car where your passenger door opened and positioned in a certain way, blah, blah, blah.  I know I've done that.  I've gotten – there have been times where you just can't wait.  So you pull your car, your nose in a little bit, then you open up your door and make a little, like, V, a little triangle in there that's closed up pretty good. 
[00:50:30]  You don't have to describe the V.  Yeah.  We've all been to sporting events.  Of course.  The old V.  So you just – you kind of go like that.  But, yeah, I guess in certain circumstances you can be stupid and be qualified as a sex offender when you really just, you know, you had a go.  How about this one?  Larry in New Jersey.  Larry!  Larry!  Your mother, Larry! 
[00:51:00]  Hi, guys.  I actually have two things, if you don't mind.  The first one was I think you guys brought up a case where some kids were riding in an SUV and a minivan family cut them off.  And they mooned the minivan, and a little kid was in the van, and so they charged him with sex offense.  Are you there?  A little kid was in the minivan.  I'm trying to figure out, yeah.  Yeah, there was a little kid.  There was a family.  You told the story.  There was a family in a minivan.  The minivan cut off the SUV.  The young boys in the SUV filmed in the minivan. 
[00:51:30]  I do remember that.  Yeah, the guys are considered sex offenders.  Sex offenders for mooning a kid.  Because there was a child in the minivan.  Well, now, see, I've got to ask.  Just a mooning or complete with a fruit basket?  You know.  Because the fruit basket, very offensive.  Was it the hanging fruit basket?  The hanging fruit basket?  Yeah.  Or the tightly knit fruit basket?  Which one?  I don't know, but you know what?  Either way, should they be never allowed in a park again? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, of course not.  Or never allowed in a park again?  Again, I think there's levels of it.  Yeah.  Well, that's what we're trying to figure out today.  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, this guy in the story we originally played is a creep.  Yeah.  He's strangling people when he's not doing stuff with kids.  I mean, he's a problem.  Yeah.  And then you got goofy people that are doing silly stuff, and also they're labeled sex offenders.  That's what I'm learning today, right?  Yeah, I think that people, I think we have to make a common sense judgment with that.  Like, does any reasonable person think that a guy mooning to make his friends laugh is the same as a guy who, like, was fumbling with a 12-year-old? 
[00:52:30]  No.  Let's go to Steve in Ohio.  Steve.  Hey, how you guys?  How you doing?  Good.  I think with the extreme level, what they need to do is make those fellows like Ken Dahls and just cut their genitalia off and make them smooth down there.  Yeah, I don't think there's a lot of people out there that are fans of the pedophile or the sex offender.  Is this what this guy did in this case?  Okay, the original story, this guy, Doddle, something like that, D-O-W-D-E-L-L, landed on the sex offender registry after admitting that he engaged in sexual activity with a 13-year-old girl. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  According to court records, however, I say however.  Yes, sir.  He was 21 at the time.  13, 21?  That's bad.  That's bad.  It's bad.  Meh.  That's bad.  But the point is, like, you should go to jail, but, like, should 25 years later or whatever, you not be allowed in a park?  Yeah, you got to think now it's many, many years later.  So he was given a three-year suspended sentence. 
[00:53:30]  The record...  It suspended the sentence.  Yeah.  I stood there like a fool, and those bastards, he smiled at me.  1996, 12 years ago, he did this.  Wow.  Now he's 33.  Let me think.  I knew somebody that was about that age.  What, 21?  Uh-huh.  And 13?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I knew someone that was about that age.  You?  Didn't seem wrong.  You?  Oh, no.  No?  No, no. 
[00:54:00]  It's Mitch Kumpstein.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, hey.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Come on, Mike.  Listen, my dad was a pedophile for 30 years, was messing with these kids in preschool.  I'm sorry, like Sunday school and stuff.  I served five years for showing my stepsister a tape of him and his new wife having sex, 
[00:54:30]  right?  And comes out, writes a book on how to help other pedophiles, you know, quit and, you  know, stop touching kids.  So I moved down there with him, and he tried to start this karaoke business with kids' songs  in an amusement park.  And then I find all these Word documents with, like, ten pictures per page of child porn.  There's tons and tons of it, man.  They don't stop.  They don't quit. 
[00:55:00]  This was your father?  My father.  So.  Along with three of my sisters and my brother.  Wait, so did your father?  They gave me the house too young.  Oh, you see your father, and he messed with your sisters and brothers, but not you?  Yep.  Poor kid.  That stinks, man.  You hate him?  Hell yeah, I hate him.  Me and my brother, I have a few murder plots, but, you know, I'm not going to go through  with it.  Wow.  Where is he now?  South Carolina.  Is he in jail?  Nope.  He only served, actually, three years out of a five-year term for lewd act, which is 
[00:55:30]  the same as relieving yourself on the side of the road.  Right.  So you have no relationship with him, right?  No.  Wow.  Not at all.  But, oddly enough, one of my sisters that wasn't in touch, supposedly, still has a relationship  with him.  And we all, like, you know, it's really weird.  I mean, you know, like, what's wrong with you, you know?  Yeah, she probably was.  All right.  But, anyway.  Have a good one, boys.  Jeez.  Thank you.  Let's go to a former cop. 
[00:56:00]  How does a father do that?  That is just so out of the realm of anything decent.  Oof.  You've got to know what you're doing, man.  The kids, the rest of his life.  What is wrong with you?  Billy in Tennessee.  Billy.  Billy, boo.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  As a former police officer, laws might be different in different states.  But, generally, they don't see a difference between any sex offense.  It's all one sex offense. 
[00:56:30]  It's up to the judge to determine how long a sex offender has to be registered and how  long they can be sentenced for.  This is Roscoe P. Coltrade.  Boo.  Former police officer.  You've got to.  There should be a couple different things.  You know, you should be.  You could be guilty of a, you know, a sex crime.  And then guilty of being just a silly goose.  It shouldn't be the same thing.  If you're mooning and you're just trying to be silly and all of a sudden a cop sees you  mooning. 
[00:57:00]  You know, come on.  That should be the same as touching a kid.  Well, sure.  I understand.  I agree with that.  I'd have a hard time charging a group of teenage boys or mooning somebody.  But as a police officer, you're trained to charge with the maximum thing you can get  away with.  So if you get shot, get caught for mooning somebody, sure, somebody might charge you with  a sex offense and make you a sex offender.  It's up for the district attorney and their lawyer to work out a plea bargain because nobody 
[00:57:30]  has to want to go to court.  The public defenders don't want to have to defend you and the DA don't want to have to  prosecute you.  They want you to accept the plea bargain.  Yeah.  You know how many cases just never go to trial?  They just are plea bargained away.  So many.  I mean, more so than I think that actually go to court.  Because you go up there, you go, I've done it plenty of times with tickets and things.  You just talk with the guy.  You plea bargain things down.  You go, OK, we'll throw this out. 
[00:58:00]  We'll give you this.  That's what you do now.  Yeah.  The county where I'm a police officer at is Sullivan County in northeast Tennessee has  a 98% conviction rate and hardly any cases go to trial.  Well, there you go.  Dag nabbit.  How about that?  There you go.  What about a lot of these calls coming in?  We can't get to all of them.  What about the sex offenders?  They're sex offenders because they were 18 and they got caught having sex with a 16-year-old.  So consensual sex, obviously. 
[00:58:30]  That's crazy.  But there's a lot of those.  A lot of them just calling our show right now.  Girls are goer.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  But it happens.  Oh, yeah, but it shouldn't be classified the same way.  Any more than somebody.  I think these murders have different classifications, whether it's first, second, and third degree.  I think everything should.  I'm sure it does.  And we got Dano.  What's up?  Good morning, bubba boys.  Hey, Dano.  Hi, Dano.  Jimmy's so cute.  I just want to pinch his little cheeks.  Thank you.  Anyway, fellas, I was in the Army with a guy. 
[00:59:00]  I was in the Army with a guy, and we were downtown in Austin, Texas.  He stepped out behind the bar and did his business behind a dumpster and took a leak, and a cop caught him.  And he got nailed for indecent exposure, and that put him on the sex offenders list for throwing a whiz.  And that's all he was doing, huh?  That's all, well, that's what he said.  Well, yeah, I mean, that's what he was doing.  He got nailed for indecent exposure.  I got to be honest.  I had no idea you could be, you know, guilty of a sex offense for taking a leak out in public. 
[00:59:30]  I'm done with that.  I'm done with that.  You get an angry cop, and next thing you know, you have to register as a sex offender for taking a leak in a parking lot at a Jets game or something, and there happened to be, like, kids around?  That's nothing.  That used to just be, like, public urination, I think they called it.  It was easy.  Right.  Now it's a sex offense?  There's a lot of those coming up right now, too. 
[01:00:00]  Punching out, boy.  Yeah, right.  All right.  We're going to move on a little bit.  Well, yeah, because people kind of clouded that one.  Like, let's say we're not talking about those type of sex offenders.  Like, let's say with common sense, we know the type we're talking about, kid touchers and people like that.  Let's just say, kid touchers, let's keep it there.  They should not be allowed in any park.  Yeah, it doesn't have to be this blanket thing.  You know, why don't I take a case-by-case basis? 
[01:00:30]  Sure.  Stupid ACLU.  You have somebody at the front of the park.  We'll call him the park boss.  And you have to stop in and fill out a little thing and get a photo ID with your crime site.  And say, what did you do?  Can I change his job title?  What did you do?  A boner checker.  Oh.  No, because that's a mistake.  What do you mean?  A boner's a mistake.  If you make a boner, it's a mistake.  Right.  That's a mistake.  It's just another word for a mistake. 
[01:01:00]  If you look it up in the dictionary, it's a mistake.  Oh.  Yeah, you made a mistake.  Yes.  Park boss has an official statement to it.  Park boss.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got something for the Red Sox fans out there.  It was a big night for the Red Sox.  Big night.  What do you got?  Well, you got the Red Sox beating the Yankees and your pal there, A-Rod.  A-Rod's my pal?  Yeah, because you're a Yankee fan.  So that's what you get.  When did that happen?  Your buddy there, A-Rod, had a terrific night. 
[01:01:30]  And we have a montage of his terrific night.  How much does he get a year for this?  A few mil, right?  Yeah.  So here's A-Rod's great night in a montage.  Count one and two.  And A-Rod takes a strike.  He doesn't love that call.  And the 2-2.  Popped up center field.  Crisp coming on.  And he'll make the play for the second out.  And the Bluebirds, here at Yankee Stadium, not liking that at bat. 
[01:02:00]  So they are looking for something to cheer for.  And there's a ground ball up the middle.  And he just hit into another double play.  And now the Boos get louder.  Wow.  Alex Rodriguez having a dreadful season in big spots and clutch situations.  We'll be back.  And the 2-2.  Swung on a miss. 
[01:02:30]  He struck him out.  And the Yankees lose 7-3.  And a nightmarish night for Alex Rodriguez.  Finally ends.  Wait, he had the final out last night, too?  Good.  Or was that just put together weird?  $28 million this year.  There you go.  Big clutch.  0 for 5.  Big clutch.  Can someone tap the Yankees and go, it's pitching, stupid.  It's always pitching.  Good pitching always beats good hitting.  Always.  Always.  There you go.  Most times.  This is where they need him. 
[01:03:00]  What do they got?  They're five, six games out.  They really need him.  And he's doing nothing.  Once again.  As much as I don't like Jeter, I mean, Jeter has been such a great clutch player.  Some guys just hit well when you need them to.  And he stinks.  One of the isolated boos at Yankee Stadium.  Yeah.  Palmer was there.  Yes, he was.  Jack in New York.  What's up?  Hi.  How you doing?  Good, Jack.  I'm in New York right now for the tennis and I caught a baseball game. 
[01:03:30]  Okay.  Oh, my God.  It's so dull.  I mean, thank God it's not in London 2012.  They're banning it from that because it's so dull.  Yeah, they are banning baseball from the Olympics.  Well, the rest of the world finds it dull.  I got to stick up for it because you guys like soccer, which is the dullest sport ever.  And your soccer hooligans just beat the crap out of each other in the stands like cavemen.  I mean, it's an animalistic sport in the stands and a bore fest on the field. 
[01:04:00]  Well, that thankfully ended a while ago in our country, thankfully.  It still happens in Europe.  But you know what?  Well, I'm sorry, but baseball, thank God it's not in London 2012.  Let's have some tug of war or do our very own cheese rolling.  Or how about some synchronized swimming?  Well, you know what?  Cheese rolling is a terrific sport.  I like the cheese rolling.  What's that all about?  The big circle of cheese goes rolling down the hill and you have to beat the cheese to the bottom? 
[01:04:30]  Is that what they have to do?  That is some great video if you want to laugh your ass off.  The cheese roll is a terrific activity.  You can't call it a sport.  How about, what's the average age of a baseballer?  What, 65?  72.  I mean, incredible.  What are they doing in between hitting those balls?  Do they eat burgers?  Are you like a morning zoo guy from England or something?  Well, no, but I'm here for the tennis.  I restring rackets. 
[01:05:00]  No, something's going on with this phone call.  We've been doing this a long time.  What are you about?  Well, no, I'm serious.  I caught a baseball game in San Francisco about two weeks ago, and I heard you guys talking about baseball a half an hour ago.  Look, baseball's not my favorite sport.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I love the hockey.  But why don't you explain to everyone why we should like soccer?  Well, the fact is, actually, soccer isn't a be-all and end-all.  I mean, I do like football.  I do, but there's many other games.  What do you mean by football, soccer or football? 
[01:05:30]  Because you guys also call soccer football over there, and football's different for us, obviously.  Football was the first in the world.  You know, you guys copied football, the name football.  Yes.  We copied the name football.  Absolutely.  And gave it to a sport that's a lot more exciting and fun to watch than your crappy football.  Well, there's not endless commercial breaks, for example, in football.  You get 45 minutes of pure drama, and then a break.  Drama?  Where's the drama? 
[01:06:00]  Where is it?  They're kicking the ball back and forth.  The score is 1-0 at the end of 15 hours.  First thing I would do if I ran soccer, I would make the field half as big.  Knowing you're Americans, you'd probably put on about five or ten different balls, wouldn't  you, for the first half?  What?  That's the way it would work, wouldn't it?  And then have breaks every two minutes.  Well, there are too many commercial breaks.  You're a wanker.  But soccer is endless and dull.  That's what you've got to do in half-time. 
[01:06:30]  You've got to wank in the half-time.  You stupid git.  What?  You didn't call him a git, did you?  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Now we've got a problem.  Now you're getting nasty.  All right, Jack.  You're full of bullocks.  Jack, obviously, we're trying to make something of your phone call, and you've got the cute  voice, the weird, like, freaking English voice.  That kind of sounds interesting on the radio.  Oh, thanks, Bill from Waterford.  Go shag the queen, you wanker.  There you go.  Okay, I'll give it one for you.  Your queen is an old hag. 
[01:07:00]  He just doesn't like baseball.  And I don't like baseball.  The queen.  Thanks, Jack.  Your queen's stupid, and she looks like a pig on your money.  Yeah.  So is our queen.  We can just call her an executive producer.  You're having to go to the queen, and you've got George W?  All right.  Hey, what about him?  He's going to be gone soon.  He's a douche, but at least, you know, he hasn't been there forever.  Exactly.  For no purpose.  At least we know when he's leaving. 
[01:07:30]  Stupid little wave.  All right.  Thank you, Jack.  This isn't going anywhere.  We tried with you.  We kind of failed with the English chap.  A-Rod made $34,500 per at-bat last night to go 0 for 5.  Nice.  He stinks when they need him.  Great.  Like I mentioned, the Olympics, you got a few discontinued Olympic events.  Mm-hmm.  There was another one that they used to do where they would see who could dive the furthest. 
[01:08:00]  Dive the furthest?  Yeah, yeah.  That used to be an Olympic sport.  But, like, go underwater and...  Yeah, but I think it was starting to get a little dangerous.  Yeah, that seems a little risky.  Well, the last year of competition in the Olympics for, well, this one, a 100-meter freestyle swim for sailors?  That was an actual Olympic event.  Oh, hi, sailor.  The last time they did that was 1896.  They were done with that.  Yeah.  And they had an obstacle race, a swimming obstacle race, that ended in 1900. 
[01:08:30]  What was that about?  What kind of obstacles?  I'm sure they had to go around little pylons, maybe, and swim.  Zig and snag.  Swim zigzagged style.  It would be exciting if they threw a shark in the water or something.  Sounds dull.  Also, in 1900, they stopped doing the live pigeon shooting event.  Wow, you'd think 1900, they still wouldn't care, you know?  Yeah.  Live pigeons?  What would they do?  I guess it's like a skeet or trap shooting. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  And just real birds.  1904.  You're going to have to look this one up.  Before, after the break, they got rid of the All Around Dumbbell event.  Oh, Jesus.  Dude, what am I supposed to do now?  I was going to go more with the proud tradition of the Nagel family winning that one.  All Around Dumbbell.  I have no idea what that event is for real, but... 
[01:09:30]  Oh, that's a good one.  A lot of jokes.  We actually won that.  We won that?  We won the All Around Dumbbell.  Yeah.  Could you find out what the All Around Dumbbell event is, Danny?  And then you got, in 1912...  The All Around Douchebag?  1912, it was a sad year for Anthony, because they got rid of the Dueling Pistol event.  What?  They actually did Dueling in the Olympics?  We'll have that work without somebody dying.  Were people dying, or were they protected somehow?  Protected?  I don't know. 
[01:10:00]  Give them a vest.  And then in 1912, they also got rid of the two-handed javelin event.  How far can you throw a javelin?  Two hands?  That picture is the All Around Dumbbell.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'll put it up.  That's like an old school weight with the big...  Oh, the big round...  Yeah, ends.  Where you're supposed to have the big mustache when you lift it up,  and the tattoos of steamships on your arms.  Funny you should say that.  Ah, there he is.  There's the guy.  A little chubby with a big mustache holding that big weird dumbbell thing. 
[01:10:30]  We'll put that picture up on O&A radio.  And then in 1920, they got rid of the tug of war.  That was actually a sport.  That would be kind of cool between a couple countries.  Yeah.  Eh.  And then the rope climb.  Too many people getting that funny feeling, I guess.  Friction burns.  Too many funny feelings happening with that event.  They had to get rid of that one.  The rope climb. 
[01:11:00]  All right.  We will take a break.  Continue.  Oh, we didn't do the hot porn story yet.  Yeah.  And they're showing the video on TV.  Wow.  They're a little brave.  They're showing it on TV.  Oh, yeah.  They're so brave.  But a huge, huge, huge...  Totally clips of the porno.  Sucks.  We'll explain next.  Opie and Anthony.  This is a recording.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you. 
[01:11:30]  Fuck you.  Please leave a message after the tone.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU live at 866-FU-LINE1.  866-FU-LINE1.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You fuck.  Opie and Anthony.  Hi. 
[01:12:00]  Good morning.  We got to get primetime in here.  Primetime, Sam Roberts.  I didn't forget.  Top gayest wrestling move.  Right, Sam?  We were looking for a real gay wrestling move.  Sam made a YouTube video.  I think this has legs, this YouTube video you put together.  Yeah.  Men's legs wrapped around each other.  Doing horrible things.  And brought up a very good point about wrestling when we were growing up. 
[01:12:30]  I don't think I was ever forced to do that wrestling thing at school.  I was forced to.  I honestly don't know.  I don't remember.  It's horrible.  I'm sure if I was forced to do it, I realized that I just wasn't into that sport right away.  No, it was in gym class.  And they made you wrestle.  I don't know what it was.  It was just awful.  I'd be on the mat.  You're top.  You're bottom.  Yeah.  And then the whistle would blow.  And then all I knew is some guy is touching me in places I shouldn't be touched, throwing 
[01:13:00]  me around a mat, and then pins me.  I loved sports growing up.  I don't remember ever trying wrestling.  I don't know.  Maybe I did.  Maybe you blocked it out.  Maybe I did.  Wrestling at the back of a fan.  Yeah.  So we were talking about wrestling and how it made us uncomfortable growing up, and  then you had the guys that did wrestling growing up, and they were really mad at us, blah,  blah, blah.  And then Sam jumped in and said, well, at least the WWE doesn't have gay wrestling moves. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we said, come on.  And we named a few, and then we forced you to come up with the top five gayest wrestling  moves, right?  Yes, and I think I've got it.  Okay.  Okay.  We start with number five?  Yes.  By the way, this video you made, it's going to be up on ondayradio.com.  Is it linked yet there?  Not yet.  Will you send it?  Absolutely.  I think Danny has it.  Okay.  Okay.  So the fifth of the top five gay wrestling moves would be The Undertaker's Last Ride. 
[01:14:00]  The Undertaker's Last Ride.  Now, what could this possibly be?  I know the Piledriver.  Is it kind of the Piledriver?  No, it's more of a power bomb, but see.  Oh, I thought you said power bottom.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  That's not even it.  Oh, this isn't The Last Ride.  No, this is it, but here comes the gay part.  See, he holds them up.  Oh.  Okay.  Well.  All right.  Here's what he did.  And then he throws them down.  Yeah.  Wow, that's pretty good. 
[01:14:30]  Well, the throwdown's very impressive.  Yeah.  But right before the throwdown is...  He grabs them.  He puts his head, the Undertaker, puts the opponent's head directly between his legs.  Yes.  The guy is bent over 90 degrees at the hips.  His head is directly between the Undertaker's legs, kind of in a thigh lock.  Uh-huh.  Right.  And then the Undertaker picks him up and flips him onto his shoulders.  His own shoulders.  But backwards, yeah.  Yeah, flips him onto the Undertaker's own shoulders backwards, so all of his manhood is that close 
[01:15:00]  to the Undertaker's face.  Well, before he gets to the manhood part, because he rolls them in such a way, he's getting everything  of the man.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's like a man Rolodex flipping in your face.  It's like the Shroud of Turin.  Yeah, he rolls all the man goodness into his own face before he slams him down to the ground. 
[01:15:30]  So what is that called?  It's called The Last Ride, and what makes it different for a regular powerbomb is he actually  leaves him on his shoulders for longer.  Like a regular powerbomb, you just flip him up and drop him, but the Undertaker leaves him  up there for a little bit.  To get every essence?  Well, I think it's to increase the impact of the fall.  The impact, huh?  But...  All right.  That's number five.  Yes.  Coming in at number four.  Wait a minute, so we...  It's the gayest move ever.  Yeah.  We start with that one?  Yes.  Wow.  And it's going to get a lot worse than that? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Number four.  Number four we touched on yesterday, and it would be a lot higher, but technically it's  not a move.  It's more of just a dance.  This is Norman Smiley and The Big Wiggle.  The Big Wiggle.  Yes, from the WCW days.  This is...  See, he's fighting Terry Funk here.  Oh, Terry Funk.  Sure.  And now he's...  Wait a minute.  Here we go.  Terry Funk is bent over, and now he's...  The guy's behind him, and he's smacking his ass while doing some kind of simulated sex 
[01:16:30]  move on The Gentleman.  Yes.  What is that about?  It's kind of just a dance you would see at a gay club.  Yeah, yeah.  It's that, you know, ride him cowboy kind of thing.  Yeah.  The guy, unfortunately, must have been hurt a little bit, and he was down on all fours,  and this gentleman gets behind him and simulates a horrific act as he smacks the sides of his  buttocks.  Yeah.  What makes it a bit gayer, too, is the fact that he's wearing a catcher's protector. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  With the protection down below that kind of swings, making it look like something else  might be swinging.  Well, he was in the hardcore division, so he would wear baseball padding like that.  Oh, yeah.  He's hardcore, right?  Yeah.  He's doing what...  I remember the Beavis dance.  When Beavis and Butthead would dance, and Beavis would do that little dance where he'd pull  his arms in and then smack, make it look like he's smacking an ass.  Yeah.  That's what he's doing.  But he's actually smacking an ass. 
[01:17:30]  Yes.  His Norman Smiley.  Yes.  That, well, pretty gay.  Yeah, and that's number four.  That's only number four.  And let it be known that the great Terry Funk got him in the end there, so...  Oh, yes.  All right.  He had a chair.  Got him in the end?  Oh, the finish of the match.  Okay, that scared me a little bit.  Yeah, Terry Funk got his...  A little bit.  He had a chair.  Got his payback.  Swung the metal chair back over his own head.  Yeah.  And hit the...  Took care of the rapist.  It's a sodomite.  It's a sodomite. 
[01:18:00]  It crossed his head.  That's number four.  Number four.  That seems like it would be number one, Prime Time.  Some people would think that, but not the case.  I did a lot of research for this.  Okay.  Number three.  KS Wrestling Move.  Yes.  Number three is a tag team maneuver by the Dudley Boys, which I think didn't have a name.  I think they just called it the What's Up.  The What's Up.  Yeah, because basically what we have here, there's Bubba Ray Dudley.  Uh-huh.  He gets a guy.  Typical body slam.  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  Guy's flat on his back now.  But then he holds his two legs up.  Oh, he holds his legs up.  Says, What's Up?  What's Up?  What's Up?  And then he, uh, his half-brother, Devon, jumps off the top rope and, but I don't get  it.  That would be a diving headbutt to the groin.  Yeah, he headbutted, he jumped off the top rope as his brother holds the guy's legs back  in a position that can only be described as a woman in labor.  Yes.  He's holding, he's using his hands as like the stirrups. 
[01:19:00]  And then his brother jumps off the top rope and hits, hits him with his head directly  in his very sensitive region.  I think there was the, he's hitting the in-between area, but his nose is landing in the...  Why would you do that move?  I don't know.  That's a lose-lose.  Yes.  Yeah, there's no real winners there, right, Jimmy?  If the nose is an inch off, you're stuck to the other guy.  All right, that's pretty bad.  Oh, that is really bad.  Gaius Wrestling moves, that's number three. 
[01:19:30]  What do you got for the runner-up, Gaius Wrestling move?  Well, the runner-up, I thought would be the winner.  Yeah.  But it turned out just to be the runner-up.  We also explored this a little yesterday.  This is called the Stephen Carr.  It's actually X-Pac's Bronco Buster.  Oh, right, the Bronco Buster.  Yeah, yeah, that's just ridiculous.  This poor gentleman is in the corner.  He's sitting because he's just been beat up.  His arms are over the bottom ropes.  He's stuck in the corner. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  And X-Pac is bouncing on his upper chest neck area.  He's bouncing on his chin.  As he's, yeah.  Yeah.  He's jumping up and down.  He's using his neck as a seat as he bounces up and down.  We saw that point with him in China.  Nothing is hitting that guy's face.  No, no, that's true.  He was not packed.  China was packing a hell of a lot more.  And, of course, his groin is right and the guy's.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's an awful wrestling move. 
[01:20:30]  There's something worse than that.  Well, here, the thing about the Bronco Buster that we need to note is the groin is used as the weapon, whereas usually that's the vulnerable spot.  Oh, okay.  Here on the Bronco Buster, X-Pac reverses it and uses his groin as a weapon.  Such a fine line.  Yeah.  See, I thought that would be number one, but somebody Facebook messaged me and said, Sam.  Facebook?  Yes.  If you're going to do this gay wrestling thing, you have to check out Dan Shoku Dino from Japan.  Wow, we have to go halfway around the world. 
[01:21:00]  Have you heard of this guy before?  I haven't done your research.  No.  Did he fight Ali back in the day?  I don't think he did.  No.  Okay.  But he's a Japanese wrestler who, I guess, plays a character who is a homosexual.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  Interesting.  Okay.  That's his angle.  Yep.  And his move set goes right along with this character.  Does he have a name for his move?  His finishing move?  His finisher is just called the Dan Shoku Driver.  Oh.  Now, the setup.  The word starts with boo.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  And ends with.  Well.  All right.  Yeah.  See, the setup involves him first pulling his tights down.  Is he fighting a girl or a tranny in this?  Match here?  What's that?  That's a boy.  Is that him?  Which one is him?  He's the one who is.  He's the one on top.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  The big guy.  Go ahead and play it.  So, he starts off by setting up, by taking his tights down. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  All right.  And he's wearing a kind of a G string.  Then he takes a G string down to reveal another one.  A smaller G string.  Yes.  And now he's in a tiny little G string.  He's going right toward the guy.  The guy is stuck in the corner.  His opponent.  Oh, my God.  He does what I call the reverse stink face.  Wow.  And then he traps his opponent's head in his tights.  In his tights.  And pile drives him that way.  Oh, my God.  And then he pins him.  With his crotch on his face. 
[01:22:30]  With his crotch.  Yeah.  See, normally people would try to escape the pile driver.  But in this case, your head is actually in another man's pants.  It's stuck in his pants.  Yes.  So, you can't escape that pile driver.  Wow.  Oh, we get to see it again.  Thank you, Dave.  He taunts the poor opponent.  Yeah.  Getting him into the corner.  And then he slams his hips right toward his opponent.  Right.  Burying what looks to be.  His face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The front of his thong.  Because he's wearing a thong. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  It's a little Speedo type thing.  The shiny gold one.  Yeah.  And you know how guys, when they wear Speedos, it looks like you're carrying your Aggies  in an old marble bag from the 50s.  Not this guy.  Looks like he has two pumpkin seeds.  And wow.  He really jams that thing home.  We're getting all the goodness in here.  You want to describe it further, Anthony?  Horrid.  No.  Not anymore.  We don't have video evidence of all of his moves yet. 
[01:23:30]  I'm going to start searching for stuff.  Oh, I bet he's got some great moves.  Yeah, I read up on him, and he does a version of the Stone Cold Stunner that's called the  Pipe Cutter, where it's a Stone Cold Stunner, except he is holding his opponent's groin.  The Pipe Cutter, huh?  He has a move called the Lip Lock, which is simply French kissing your opponent.  Who knew we'd get to this point with this bit?  Yes.  I really thought the Bronco Buster was going to be number one. 
[01:24:00]  No.  He also has a move.  It's similar to the Rock Bottom.  Mm-hmm.  It looks the same as the Rock Bottom, except he shoves his opponent's hand inside of his  trunks, so his opponent is further stuck to him.  I can't say the name of the move.  Wow.  But it rhymes with Rock Bottom.  Oh, okay.  So it's almost Rock Bottom.  Nice.  Except something else.  Wow.  This is like, this guy should be arrested for sexual assault. 
[01:24:30]  He shouldn't be wrestling.  Kick one of the marks after a match.  No.  I think Vince McMahon should look into this guy.  Yeah, bring him on board.  Why isn't he in the WWE there, Sam?  I have no idea, but I think-  Bring me that fruit.  I want that fruit right now.  You bring him to me, he's going to be in the WWE.  What do you like about him, Vince?  I like his moves.  Yeah.  I like how he uses his big, fat f*** in all of his moves. 
[01:25:00]  That's right.  I'd like to buff his ass.  He's got some moves I'd like to see.  Yeah?  Yeah, I want to bring him into the ring and get him completely naked and have him stick his  f*** in everybody's f***.  That's an attention gunner.  Come on, come on, come on.  Wow.  Yeah.  Dan Shoku- 
[01:25:30]  I like the f*** bottom.  He calls it the-  Yes.  Wow.  No subtleties there.  Getting away with a little bit more in Japan.  I guess so.  I certainly do.  Dan Shoku Dino and the Dan Shoku driver.  Nice.  The number one gay wrestling move.  Right there in the pants.  It turned out all right.  Prime time Sam Roberts.  Yes.  And the montage of the video is up on ondayradio.com.  So check it out for yourself.  Prime time redeems himself from yesterday's debacles. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  I didn't think yesterday was that much.  Ah, we did.  And that's all that really matters.  Yeah, no, that's true.  Yeah, we made Steve Coogan very, very uncomfortable yesterday.  Extremely uncomfortable.  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  Should we take a break or you want to do this porn thing?  Ah, the porn.  We could probably squeeze the porn thing in.  Can we?  Yeah.  All the local news station, they got a nice video.  There's some controversy.  There's some outrage because a porn star decided to make a porn movie.  I don't even know if she's a porn star. 
[01:26:30]  Like, I've never seen her.  Jim would probably know if she was a porn star.  I think it looked like one of those homemade kind of porn movies.  Well, she's a star today, my friend.  Yeah, well, that's true.  Especially a porn star.  There she is.  Wow.  She's very tall.  She looks tall anyway.  Slender, blonde hair.  How can you tell she's kneeling with a mouthful?  Well, that's true.  She's got some nice cans, nice ass.  You know, she's set up nice.  And then here she is at the park.  Here's the clips they couldn't quite show on the news. 
[01:27:00]  She went to a little park and went on the swings, on the little plastic slide, and things like that.  She's on a swing with a tiny little denim skirt with nothing underneath.  The janitors were trying to find the young pranksters that threw trout down the slide.  But obviously they were mistaken.  And there she's on top of the kitty slide.  Yes, there she is.  Yikes.  What do you think, Jim?  Huh?  Don't know yet? 
[01:27:30]  Well, she's really hot, but I'm trying to look and see.  Oh, I know what you want to see.  If something is fat besides her hips.  Because her hips are not fat.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  There's a picture down there, Dan.  Let's see.  Wow.  There's a shot.  Yeah.  She's doing the wee on the swing.  With that, right?  I've got to be honest.  That's a lovely girl.  Well, outrage because she did this in a public park.  It's daytime.  Fat, man.  I don't see any kids around.  Look at her playing with her slip and slide. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  But they probably chased the kids out, you know.  So sexy.  Is this New York?  Tennessee, my friend.  Oh, she's fantastic.  Here's the story.  All right.  Now to a shocking story.  Shocking.  It depends who you are.  It's not shocking.  It's not shocking.  It rules.  What's so shocking about it if she's doing this with no...  What would have been shocking if it was on a Saturday afternoon in the park with a lot of kids around?  Yeah.  It's not a kid or another person to be seen. 
[01:28:30]  It's just called outdoors.  All right.  Now to a shocking story in Bartlett.  Porn on the playground.  Police are investigating an X-rated video clip shot at one of the city's public parks.  Action News 5's Jason Miles.  He's live here now with the story you'll see only on 5.  Jason?  Well, Joe, the video was shot in broad daylight, meant for those who log on to an adult website.  But plenty of children could have seen it, too.  Bart, is that...  Come on.  As much as, you know, it's a little weird that it was in a playground. 
[01:29:00]  Ooh.  You really think that plenty of children could have seen this, Anthony?  No.  I'm sure they had a, quote, closed set.  They chased him away, it looked like.  I know it's kind of like amateur porn, but I don't think they're going to be continuing the filming process if all of a sudden they see a mom and her son walking toward the park.  Jimmy, assessment?  She's very, very hot.  I can't see the body part that I want to see because we're looking for shots of her.  Oh, yeah?  What about there?  Oh, there you go.  You can see...  That's one right there.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[01:29:30]  Looks like she got bit by a mosquito, though.  Oh.  Full mosquito action.  Just left of the...  Wow.  Is she sexy.  Can you open that one where she's on her stomach, Dan?  I want to get a good look there, if you don't mind.  Oh, it just goes to that goddamn video.  Oh, she's...  Oh, wait.  No, no.  It's a new one.  Jackie, look at it.  She's got little dog tags on.  Yeah, there she is.  Outside.  She likes being outside, it seems.  Outdoorsy girl.  Outdoorsy.  She's earthy.  I like that outdoorsy thing.  And now she's completely naked in mud. 
[01:30:00]  In mud, even though it's a beautiful summer day with the sun shining.  I don't like the mud all over the body.  Can't you just clean yourself up?  I agree.  The mud's fun.  She's having fun in the mud.  She's really hot.  I want to hear that.  Wait, do they have, like, the local angle?  Yeah, let's go with it.  No.  This is bad because this is a local park.  We come for the kids and we shouldn't see that.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Shut it.  Bartlett Grove Park sits in the middle of a subdivision. 
[01:30:30]  A favorite spot for children.  And the site of an adult website, Porno Shoot.  Hi, I'm at Bartlett Grove Park, which is a suburb of Memphis.  This clip begins innocently enough.  I thought I'd come out for the day.  But it does not end that way.  The young woman in the video exposes herself on the slide.  Obviously, it's too graphic for TV.  Okay, so she's sitting right there.  Yeah.  Barbara Taylor sees the video for the first time.  She's definitely a tramp. 
[01:31:00]  She's just nasty.  And has a typical reaction.  A vamp and a bit of a scamp.  She was a V-A-M-P.  My kid's not on the slide anymore.  Why?  The kids go to the bathroom in their pants and then go down the slide.  You idiot.  That's true.  One good rainstorm takes care of all of them.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  I thought there's going to be slug trails down the slide.  She's disgusted.  Stop.  And then it continues.  Or does it?  Sure.  Wouldn't mind smooching with her. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, Jimmy?  Danny Berryhill is a Baptist minister who lives right across the street.  Boy, I wonder what he's going to say about this.  I love it.  A Baptist minister.  Let's play.  What does the Baptist minister have to say about this one?  I think he's going to say, it's about time.  I've tried to get Foxy Jackie to expose herself on the children's rides and toys before.  Been waiting so long for this.  He'll say something about the community and...  Yeah, yeah.  This proves that there really is a God. 
[01:32:00]  There is no God.  I've been dreaming about this scenario my whole life.  Danny Berryhill is a Baptist minister who lives right across the street.  I don't have any words.  I'm a Baptist minister.  There's a word.  We decided not to publicize the exact website, but it's full of explicit pornography and a promise to...  Excuse me, can you pause that?  FoxyJackie.com! 
[01:32:30]  FoxyJackie.com!  The weird thing is that he said explicit pornography.  Yeah.  As if there was, like, subtle pornography.  Non-explicit pornography is not pornography.  Yeah.  It's a CTs.  FoxyJackie.  She's sexy.  Yeah.  The exact website, but it's full of explicit pornography.  That I perused for hours.  ...pornography and a promise to visit more public places. 
[01:33:00]  Is she violating a law?  Public indecency, yes.  Off the bat?  Right off the bat, yes.  Bartlett police are on the case after I clued them in.  I don't think this would be appropriate for an adult to see in a park, much less a child.  They say the model and those videotaping her could be charged with a number of other crimes.  These days, who knows?  She could be over 18.  She could be under 18.  A possible teenager whose adult job is causing big concerns in Bartlett.  And we did do a cursory search of that website in question. 
[01:33:30]  The young woman writes that the video in the park was shot just last week.  I failed to find any contact information.  He's a, uh, this guy's a little douche.  And after I notified them, this little faggoty snitch of a reporter told the police.  I think he, uh, is really into it.  Of course he is.  Really into it.  I must say, it's coming in like crazy.  Uh, this is going on all the time. 
[01:34:00]  Newt in public, uh, places.  They're filming this stuff a lot.  Oh, it's huge.  It's huge on websites.  It's a huge thing on websites, sure.  The problem in this case, she named the park.  Yes.  They've never been on TV, but they are, they are filming these things, uh, all over the  place and they're, and they're doing it in a way where they're getting away with it.  They're not, they're, they're making sure there's no kids or any of that crap around.  What's your, uh, what's your favorite category?  Porn category.  You know, you go to those sites and they just have a hundred different categories.  There's sex outside. 
[01:34:30]  There's girl on girl.  There's, uh, uh, uh, you know, money, the, the money, uh, the money, uh, the, the, the  finishing move, um, uh, just, uh, using certain parts of the body, you know, the big three,  the big three parts.  I'm a, I'm a fan of the, uh, when they, uh, uh, like what's your favorite category? 
[01:35:00]  I'm a fan when they, uh, blank the blank.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I don't get it.  My favorite would be, uh, I, I, I kind of like when they're eating, when they're eating  a lollipop and it's really sloppy and wet.  You like that?  Oh, do I?  That's a little too much, uh, guy.  I like, I like, um, yeah, yeah.  I, you know something that's good for part of it, but I like, um, I like the amateur ones. 
[01:35:30]  Those are good.  Oh.  I don't like the, uh, the, uh, regular looking porno chicks, stuff like that.  Amateur is way hotter than the, uh.  Yeah, yeah.  And real, not the fake, you know.  Let's go to Ellen in Ohio.  She used to do this.  Ellen.  Yes.  Hi.  Hi, Ellen.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi.  Um, yeah.  When my friends and I were in high school, we used to love to go to our local park after  school and we would all just get naked and swing on the swing.  Holy.  You're kidding me. 
[01:36:00]  No, I guess it's a good thing we never taped it because.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Cause I, I was sipping my green tea.  What, what did you used to do when you were younger?  Yeah.  We used to, after school, go to our local park and swing on the swings completely naked.  Wow.  Did you hear that, Ann?  No, we never did.  Or, uh, I don't think I heard.  Like, when, when was it in your life and what did you do?  Yeah, start over.  We're a little distracted.  Yeah.  Um, um, um, when I was in high school, high school, um, my friends and I, after school 
[01:36:30]  would go to our local park and swing on the swings naked.  Got a big thrill out of it.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh my God.  Oh my dear Jesus.  They were in high school swinging on the swings naked with each other.  There's a ton of swings.  Holy mother.  To and fro.  Holy mother of Jesus.  We don't know what you look like.  Oh!  Oh!  I like turtles.  Well, who gives a crap about you? 
[01:37:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Wow.  Tickets are on sale now.  Really?  I would, uh, pay.  I'd buy a ticket.  So you'd swing naked with your high school friends.  Yes.  And, uh, how would this start?  Oh, I don't even remember how it started.  No, please remember.  Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.  Slow down.  You have to remember.  Yes.  Okay.  One day.  Think back. 
[01:37:30]  One day we were bored.  Mm-hmm.  And we decided just to walk to the local park.  Yeah, you did.  And it was really hot.  Yeah.  How hot was it?  Yeah, what was the barometric pressure?  So we just thought it would be fun.  And, I mean, it was really fun to feel the breeze.  And so we just kept doing it after that.  So the first time you do it, how many girls are with you?  Three.  Three girls.  And you? 
[01:38:00]  So four total?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And who was the first one that said, hey, let's take our clothes off?  Um, probably me.  Yeah?  And...  Goodness gracious!  And did you strip completely naked?  Or did you start in bra and panties and then decide to take the bra off?  Um, I think I just went for it.  Yeah?  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen!  Totally nude on the swing with your friend. 
[01:38:30]  And what were you looking at each other and laughing?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  How old are you now?  Uh, I'm 28 now, actually.  Ooh.  Mm.  And then when you reach like the...  You know when you go back and forth on the swing and you reach the peak?  Did your boobies look funny?  Like anti-gravity boobies?  You swing all the way around.  Boobies.  Get caught in the chain?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  No, um, no, no, they never looked anything but normal.  Did you do that thing where you don't really swing, but you just kind of rock back and forth 
[01:39:00]  and slam into each other next to, you know, the swing next to you?  No, but that probably would have been a good idea.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right, I think we're going to...  What else can we ask?  Are you an attractive girl, Ellen?  Not that that matters, of course.  Um, I was in high school.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, something.  All right, so long.  Uh, Eric in Pennsylvania.  That's what I'm thinking.  Eric.  Hey, how come nobody's pointing out?  How did this reporter happen to stumble across it if he just wasn't watching the website? 
[01:39:30]  Of course.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a great point.  At the beginning, they're like, here's a story that was found by, uh, this reporter, and  it's like, how did he just find it?  I know.  He probably got...  Perusing.  He probably got caught looking at porn, and this is the way around it.  I'm studying, dear.  I'm studying.  I'm researching a story here, okay?  He went through thousands of websites until he finally found a way out.  Like, oh, my lucky day. 
[01:40:00]  They're doing this in my town.  All right, this is in a park.  I could use this.  All right, very nice.  Oh, and by the way, I forgot to announce it earlier, but we do have a winner for the  worst shirt in history contest.  Uh, let me look around the room.  Congratulations, Steve.  You're very welcome.  Yuck.  I think I paid $6 for this shirt.  Steve has a...  What is it?  It's a guitar shirt.  It's a guitar shirt.  But it's the worst guitar shirt I've ever seen. 
[01:40:30]  It's got big black guitars.  Like, one is, uh, started at his waist and comes all the way up to his neck.  Like, the neck of the guitar goes up to his shoulder.  And the other one, um, is the upside down where the neck of the guitar starts at his  waist and the bottom of the guitar goes up by his shoulder.  It's like two guitars laying, uh, toes to nose.  Don't even try to describe it.  It's that horrible.  What is that, a Les Paul in there?  Is it?  Yeah, it must be.  One's a Les Paul.  One looks like a Ibanez Iceman.  It's a tight, awful, and it has, like, little red design lines. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Oh, it's awful.  Oof.  I think, yeah.  I just took a picture.  It'll be on.  Oh, please put it up.  ONAradio.com in a mere few minutes.  Oh, thank you.  We have to take a quick break.  Looks like Jimmy Page's vomit.  Ooh.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Hey, uh, do we have, uh, guests calling in today?  Who are we going to do?  Dana White.  Oh, Dana White from the UFC.  And also Chris Angel.  I don't know if Chris is calling if it's just Dana, but I know it's, uh, he's going to 
[01:41:30]  talk about the Chuck Liddell fight, I think, which is Saturday, September 6th.  Coming up soon.  Am I wrong about that?  It's like in two weeks.  And what's Chris Angel going to be, uh, talking about?  Liddell's fighting him.  Oh, wow.  I gotta see that.  He's going to make something disappear.  Where'd it go?  I don't know.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show is now back.  A bomb of monumental proportions.  Holy shit.  What's going on with Aerosmith these days?  Anyone know? 
[01:42:00]  Uh, nothing.  No, what are they, touring?  Old pals of the show.  They used to do the show from time to time.  Well, Steven Tyler's got a tell-all book that's just coming out, so he's going to be making  the rounds.  Nice.  I don't know about the whole band, but you'll see Steven in town very soon.  Very cool.  What does everyone not know at this point?  He's got some stories.  Yeah, they kind of told them all.  Didn't he used to bang a DJ here in New York?  Allegedly.  Oh, yeah.  I remember hearing about that.  Mark.  A good old Mark Perrano joke. 
[01:42:30]  Uh, it's Opie and Anthony.  Huh?  I can't hear you.  What?  Uh, Aerosmith just put out their own, uh, Guitar Hero.  Oh, that's right.  Nothing but Aerosmith.  Oh.  Guitar Hero Aerosmith.  It takes you through their whole, uh, music career from the beginning.  Wow.  I'm sure they're doing very, very well with that.  There's money to be made with that Guitar Hero with these bands.  Like, you have a Metallica version, you have a Zeppelin version.  That's the way to go with that game.  Plus, with, uh, you know, with Rock Band and all these musical, uh, themed games, what  you could do is, uh, bands are starting to release singles and their old collection as 
[01:43:00]  downloads that you pay for.  So not only are they making money off their albums, off of the, uh, licensing, touring,  now they're making money off of downloading these songs that you could play on your Xbox,  PlayStation, whatever.  Who saw that one coming?  By the way, this song would be a very, very easy on Guitar Hero, right?  But look, look.  I think it's actually on.  I got it.  Look.  Boom, boom.  It's on Guitar Hero.  Boom, boom.  No, I don't think you do.  Too easy, this one?  877-212-0&A. 
[01:43:30]  Um, I want to say happy birthday to the star who had the greatest fall from fame ever.  I will challenge the folks out there to come up with someone that had, uh, a greater fall  from fame than this person who's celebrating a birthday today.  Can we guess who it is?  Or are you up for a while?  I would say...  The greatest fall from fame ever.  Chevy Chase.  No.  Roman Polanski.  Ooh, that's right.  Roman Polanski, though, just won an Oscar.  I mean, Jesus.  Yeah, you're right.  For what? 
[01:44:00]  Uh, some...  What was that movie again?  I think I saw it.  I think it...  WALL-E.  Roman Polanski, he's a good director.  He certainly is.  Chinatown?  Yeah.  You want to guess?  How old is a person?  Yes.  All right, 56.  When did they fall from grace?  You know, uh, this is where we realized that time just sucks because I would say 10 years,  but I bet you it's longer now.  When were they at their peak?  Uh, 80s. 
[01:44:30]  80s.  Late 80s, I would say.  Late 80s.  Uh...  Pushing into the 90s.  Is it...  Hmm?  Gary Glitter.  No.  Oh.  Is it...  Um...  Was it, uh, scandalous or just kind of faded away?  Oh, yeah.  Hmm.  Oh, yeah.  Ah.  Oh.  I know.  Who was it?  80s?  90s?  I know.  What?  Harold Ramis.  You got it?  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  All right.  Do I do an impression of the person?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Happy birthday to Pee Wee Herman.  Ah.  Paul Rubens.  Of course, Paul Rubens is his real name.  Yes.  56 years old today.  56?  The greatest fall from fame ever.  Yep.  Wow.  Although Elliot Spitzer is pretty impressive.  Yeah.  But he's more in the political category of that.  Yeah.  Pee Wee had, uh, you know, the kids show going.  Yep.  He was Playhouse.  He was huge.  Yeah.  And, uh...  That ruined his career. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He pretty much...  Wait, he came back, uh...  He did come back in Blow.  It was Blow.  That's right.  Yeah.  And he was great in Blow.  Yeah, he was really good.  And people were like, I think Pee Wee's coming back now.  Yeah.  But then that was it, I think.  No, no, no.  I stand corrected.  Because then there was, uh, charges of nude children's photos on his computer.  Trading with the principal there from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  Jeffrey Jones, yeah.  Yeah.  Yes, Travis.  What about 30 Rock?  You liked him in 30 Rock, remember?  I forgot that he was in 30 Rock.  He was hilarious in 30 Rock.  He's still doing all right, I guess.  He was the little, uh... 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, but this is the comeback period.  Paging Mr. Herman.  Five or six years.  Paging Mr. Herman, you have a telephone call at the front desk.  Do we have the clip from 30 Rock?  See, this is, with a staff of 20 like we have, you know, some of these things should be considered  for the radio show, because we played that clip when he was on 30 Rock, and it was hilarious.  If we're doing birthdays, we should kind of have some stuff from each person whose birthday  it is in case we want to do something.  That's right.  Jay!  Yeah, I don't know if it was child porn, or if it was classified as just, like, quote-unquote 
[01:46:30]  art, like, nude kids for whatever reason, but he...  He called it kitschy art.  Did he?  And it was, um, yeah, they were black and white, mostly pictures of nude, younger, uh,  boys and young men.  That's just, come on.  Um, but he said he, you know, considers it art, because they're tastefully done, and blah,  blah, blah, blah, blah, you like naked boys.  Exactly.  God, these guys will try anything, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Now they're going with black and white photos from the 50s and 60s. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, hey...  Look, this is okay, because now this kid's 60 in real life.  I remember, uh, well, when the internet first started coming around, and, uh, you had to  find your nudity where you could, instead of just knowing exactly where to go, uh, Danny.  He'd be like, hey, Danny, where is this, uh, porno?  And he'll, he'll punch it right up.  So, uh, but back in, in the day, as I like to call it, the day, you'd have to go to,  like, um, sites like, uh, nudist colony sites. 
[01:47:30]  And, and wow, what disasters you would get.  There's not one picture that's, uh, any later than 1965, and it just, it doesn't even look  like they're nude.  Quite frankly, it looks like the women are wearing, um, some type of, uh, I don't know,  bearskin bikini.  They love clown porn.  What the hell was that?  Oh, you've never seen clown porn?  Oh, well, put that in my mouth. 
[01:48:00]  Well, that was a horrid picture.  Clown porn is silly.  It's just dumb.  Clowns and porn, they don't go together.  People have weird things with clowns, though.  People have a fear of clowns.  Like, years ago, I dated a girl who was terrified of clowns.  But that's, like, a real thing with people.  Clowns have a weird effect.  Yeah.  Clowns are definitely creepy.  Hey, uh, moving on really fast to some other things.  Uh, we were talking about the assassination plot against Obama yesterday. 
[01:48:30]  And it turns out these guys are a bunch of meth heads, and they've kind of dropped the  charges, except for the drug charges or something.  They're pretty much saying, uh, there's no way these guys could get an assassination done  or something.  Yeah, they said they were too crazy, uh, into drugs and meth and stuff to really pull this  off.  Yet, they keep saying, hey, they just, they don't like Obama and they have weapons.  But, uh, they're, they're being held on their drug charges.  Yeah, they ain't going anywhere.  So, but I don't think they're charging them with any attempt on Obama's life. 
[01:49:00]  No, but the DA says he can elevate the charges after the convention.  So they may just sit on them for a while.  Ah, okay.  Jack up the charges.  All right.  Why make a crowd of assassins?  Yeah.  You know, they just kind of thin, thin them out a little by putting a few in jail.  Because, wow, this Obama is going to be one of the most protected presidential candidates  and presidents in the history of this country.  Believe you me.  Because there are some fanatics, are they anarchists and, uh, revolutionaries, racists, 
[01:49:30]  uh, that are really, really unhappy with the prospect of, uh, the first black president.  And that's just on the staff.  Right.  That's what I was talking about.  In this room.  I wonder which person in this room.  What?  Look around.  I'm very tolerant, to tell you the truth.  Hmm.  I want to see, uh, you know, how this plays out.  I want to be around for a black president.  What?  Just to see how it is. 
[01:50:00]  Huh?  Yeah.  You do?  Just to mix things up a little bit.  Really?  Yes.  How funny would it be if McCain took, like, a real swish as his vice president?  Like, the most, like, gayest gay guy.  Hmm.  Just, uh, you know, someone who kind of talked like that.  And who was just, like, completely...  Really gay.  ...lible before gay marriage.  Wow.  And McCain just, like, kind of just trashed his vice president's policies, and his vice  president attacked him.  That would be really good.  And he walks up on the podium after they announce, and he's got his life partner with 
[01:50:30]  him.  Big, open-mouthed tongue kiss in front of a national audience.  And McCain looks to his left, and he can see he had no idea.  Ah, he didn't know.  He had no clue.  What the hell is this?  What the hell did I do?  I picked a goddamn...  I picked a fruit.  I picked a fruit.  That's too funny.  Um, you know what I was thinking last night?  That McCain should have picked...  Now, hear me out on this one.  Hillary Clinton as the vice president. 
[01:51:00]  Hmm?  Hillary just blows up...  Blows up Obama's spot last night.  She announces in front of everybody on that stage at the Democrat convention that she is  going to be the vice president for McCain.  All hell would break loose.  Oh, wow.  The confusion.  What would people do?  Oh, my God.  What is going on?  And then she gets to be president four years because McCain is one and done.  She might be president, you know, a month after the inauguration. 
[01:51:30]  By June.  The way his health is.  Yeah.  Just keep picking them apart.  Now, that's called shaking things up.  That would shake things up.  I'm just waiting for something to happen that really shakes things up.  She changes her party to, like, independent or something.  Yeah.  Who did that?  Lieberman.  It's not that fast.  Hell, Lieberman.  Lieberman did it, and he's still a big wig in the political arena.  Yes.  Imagine she did that and didn't tell anyone. 
[01:52:00]  Does that accept a vice presidential candidate, a vice presidential ticket, and wow.  There would be some talking today, right?  Hey, did we do the protesters?  We got a couple quick clips of the protesters outside the convention.  You know what happens?  This happens every time they have an election.  The conventions draw in lunatics, crazy people that are protesting everything.  The cops keep them pretty far away from where the convention is being held, but the press 
[01:52:30]  loves going out and giving these guys attention.  There were so many 9-11 conspiracy people.  There are people there for, you know, the environment, global warming, UFOs, everything.  And they got these huge signs and very elaborate, almost floats that they carry with them.  One was an Earth with something rotating around it like these signs that we have to save our planet. 
[01:53:00]  And it took like 10 of these friggin' hippies to walk this thing down the street.  Can you bring a lawn chair?  I would just sit in a lawn chair and watch that.  And watch.  I would love to sit in a lawn chair.  Who cares what's going on inside?  That looks like it's the real show outside.  Yes, exactly.  I'd love to watch and just watch police batons getting bloodied.  Oh, would that be fun.  And just watch the red dot of a taser before you hear the,  There goes another one. 
[01:53:30]  By the way, also, we got to mention how good Chelsea's looking.  Chelsea was on stage at the convention.  What the hell?  She lost weight.  She was getting her mother's thighs and calves, which was disturbing.  But she was out in a little black, short, little dress number.  And she didn't look too bad at all.  Yeah, she absolutely slimmed down.  She's looking not too bad.  She's in the prime of her hotness right now. 
[01:54:00]  Is she?  Yeah, she's got about another four years.  Yeah?  And then she goes down in the minor leagues and hopes that she could, you know,  get it back together for the big leagues.  And then eventually she's in, what, just like Cape Cod?  Mm.  The Cape Cod League.  Where's that babe, Amy Carter?  Oh, was she hot.  Can we get a recent picture of Amy Carter?  Yeah, where's Amy Carter?  You know who Hillary's body looks like in that pantsuit?  She looked like Burgess Meredith is the penguin.  Yeah, I'll stretch that with a bunt. 
[01:54:30]  She waddled out.  She had a bunt.  Let's see what the protesters are up to.  It had been anticipated that as many as 100,000 protesters would show up for the Democratic  Convention thus far.  That has not materialized.  There have been thousands of people out here.  Everyone has a cause and a different message.  I'm against the Democrats and Republicans because they're just one big corporate party.  It's up to we, the people, to push the politicians for change we can believe in.  Don't wait for the politicians to lead we, the people, or it'll never happen. 
[01:55:00]  To those taking part, the issues are serious, including this group that claims the whole  story about 9-11 hasn't been told.  The government, you know, was totally in on 9-11.  Everybody knows that.  And then he goes, and then he just writes it off like, everybody knows that.  Everybody, huh?  And there were people protesting.  I guess the fact that Hillary wasn't the nominee.  They were very angry.  And they're driving around. 
[01:55:30]  And you know how Hillary's been talking and the Democrats have been talking about global  warming and everything.  Well, Stuntbrain pointed out something very interesting.  They were driving Humvees down the road.  These protesters.  They are a bunch of spoiled brats, hypocrites, or aged hippies that just don't know what  to do with their time anymore.  It's sad when you see them.  That one guy that they showed that said 9-11 was an inside job.  Everybody knows that.  The government was behind.  Everybody knows that. 
[01:56:00]  No, everyone doesn't know that.  All the douches you hang out with know that.  They just want to belong to a group.  Yeah.  They want to have something that makes them feel empowered and strong and like they can  change things.  That's all it is.  Ugh.  They just join these little groups and cliques and they just go along with it.  Yeah.  I think Jimmy brought it up yesterday, that Penn and Teller episode of Bullcrap, where  they were saying how countries could get along as if they just trade. 
[01:56:30]  Another part of that episode was these protesters that joined these groups just because they  think they're joining some big cause.  But in reality, they keep saying that it makes them feel good.  So they're trying to protest something just simply for selfish purposes because it makes  them feel better about themselves, not necessarily the purpose that they're supposed to be fighting  for.  There you go.  The police presence here is extraordinary.  Denver has nearly doubled the size of its force and has brought in 1,500 officers from  other communities.  Some feel it's overkill.  Security is obviously very necessary.  But we're calling this Fort Denver because we think that Homeland Security gave Denver 
[01:57:00]  a grant and they just had to spend all the money they could.  They're protesting even the security.  Protesting the security.  Here they are, as a matter of fact, on the news.  That's the story we were watching.  And you look at these people and just they're dressed like American Indians.  They're just like every cause shows up.  And they're all stupid.  Look at this guy with his drums.  This guy thinks Hillary should be walking down the sidewalk with a giant, what is that? 
[01:57:30]  White house.  A big white house.  Is it?  Yeah.  Jesus hates who?  Sin.  Oh, Jesus hates sin.  So they got the Holy Rollers.  Then here's the 9-11, the truth.  The end is near.  The end is near guy with wacky glasses.  The liberty bell.  And there's the big globe.  Climate.  Climate stabilization.  9-11 was an inside job. 
[01:58:00]  These.  Neocon jobs.  Iraq, 9-11.  And this is the guy that said everyone knows.  And there's the big Humvees rolling down the street, just blowing out.  God, I would love to check that out.  Yeah, these are where the kooks are.  This is where you go.  Imagine sending our young Sam into that crowd.  That would be wonderful.  The audio.  Holy mother of God.  You know what, though?  The Republican convention will attract a lot of them, too.  Worse. 
[01:58:30]  We should send somebody out there.  Yeah.  All right, listen.  We do have to take a quick break.  Good idea.  We got Dana White calling in.  Dana.  Of course, the owner of the UFC.  We're going to talk about the Chuck Liddell fight.  Let's see what he has on Rampage Jackson.  Not looking good for Rampage.  No, man.  And some other things.  And I think Chris Angel is going to join the phone call, possibly?  I'm not sure.  I think so.  What's that about it?  They're working together or something?  They might be.  I mean, when I was there with Bob Kelly, I saw Chris and Sully together.  I didn't talk to them.  They were across the room, but they were at the fight.  All right, we'll find out next.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:59:00]  Opie and Anthony, we got to go right to the phones.  We got Dana White from the UFC on the line.  Dana.  What's up, buddy?  What's up, man?  I want to start by telling you I was watching the Olympics.  Yeah.  And I was thinking to myself, UFC in the Olympics.  Wouldn't that be awesome?  How cool would that be to see UFC matches featuring guys from around the world?  I hope I'm alive to see it.  Because last time we talked, I do believe one of your dreams is to take this global, right? 
[01:59:30]  Mm-hmm.  And I was thinking...  In the next five, six years, I mean, we're going everywhere.  We're going to...  We're already over in the UK.  We have an office there.  We're going to Spain, Italy, France.  We're going down to Dubai.  We're going to Australia.  We're going to the Philippines.  We're taking this thing.  Right now, we're in 190 different countries on some form of TV, and now we're going to take  the live event to all those places.  Yeah, you're just blown up.  But, you know, there's a lot of countries we hate.  Could you imagine you watch the American guy just kicking the ass of some country we hate? 
[02:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  Put country here.  I mean, it's not the same when, like, our diving team beats, you know, Iraq's diving team.  Who cares?  You're not getting that same oomph.  Well, you know what?  It does have that international flavor to it now.  I mean, we've got Brazilians, guys from England, guys from Croatia.  I mean, we've really got people from all over the world.  It totally makes sense for this to be an Olympic sport.  Think about this.  You've got boxing, where you can strike with your hands.  You've got judo, where you can do chokes and throws and everything else. 
[02:00:30]  You've got wrestling, where you can do takedowns.  And they do taekwondo, where you can use kicks and punches.  So it's really just putting it all together.  Yeah, absolutely.  What it is, mixed martial arts.  It should be an Olympic sport, but it's going to take a while.  Hey, where are we at with Rampage Jackson?  Now, Rampage did our show a couple times.  We love this guy.  He was so much fun on our show, a great sense of humor.  And he's in a lot of trouble.  Now they're saying two felonies and four misdemeanor charges with that driving incident last month? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, he's the greatest.  And he is.  He's a great guy.  It's one of those unfortunate things where he, you know, when it happened, I was like, this makes no sense.  I've known Rampage for a long time.  And the first thing you think of, did he do drugs?  Did he do drugs?  It's the only thing that makes sense.  So I flew right down there.  What happened was he didn't do drugs.  He wasn't drunk.  He got something called delirium.  It was exhaustion and dehydration caused delirium.  And so, you know, yeah, he's in trouble legally. 
[02:01:30]  But, you know, when he gets in court, the guy had a physical condition.  You know, what are you going to do?  Well, after he lost, what happened?  He stopped eating and he was just drinking energy drinks or something like that?  He went on a fast.  He started fasting.  He stayed in Vegas, was hanging out at the pool, started fasting, didn't eat or drink water, was only drinking energy drinks, which kept him up for like four days.  Yeah, he didn't sleep for like four days.  And then he jumped in that ridiculous truck of his, by the way. 
[02:02:00]  We've all seen the pictures of Rampage Jackson's truck.  Exactly.  It's like, what, 20 feet off the ground?  He had dinner with Lorenzo and I on the Sunday night.  Yeah.  Then he was acting a little weird that night.  We thought he was drunk.  We thought he was drunk.  Then he flew home that night and the next thing happened.  Yeah, then he got in his monster truck and kind of rolled over a bunch of cars.  A monster truck.  Yeah.  And so there's a woman who's, he's being sued now by a woman who said she was 16 weeks pregnant and she's blaming him for her miscarriage. 
[02:02:30]  But it happened two weeks after the hit and run incident and you're coming out saying you think she's just kind of digging for some money?  Well, actually, they just came, they were going to file, they were wondering if that was true, they were possibly going to file murder charges against him.  And it wasn't true.  She didn't, the doctor came out and said she didn't lose the baby because of that.  Okay.  Okay, so that's not going to happen.  Good.  Rampage knocked her rear view mirror off when he drove by her. 
[02:03:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  You know, Dana White, you're a stand-up guy.  You're taking care of your boys.  Listen, he's a great guy.  I've known him for years.  He's a really good person.  It'd be a whole other ball game if he was on drugs or drunk driving down the street hitting cars.  You know what I mean?  The guy had a physical condition.  It could happen to anybody, I guess, if you were fasting out in the sun and drinking energy drinks for four days.  It could happen to anyone.  Have you talked to him recently?  Yeah, he was actually in my office yesterday. 
[02:03:30]  And he's probably back to being normal, right?  Yeah.  Well, what happens is once they released him that night, they released him.  And when he came out that night, oh, my God, it was crazy.  He was not the rampage that I know.  He went home.  The police came back and got him from his house and took him and brought him in.  And he went in for 72 hours of psychiatric evaluation.  Can I back you up a second, Dana?  Can you imagine you're the police officer? 
[02:04:00]  All right, this is what you're doing tonight.  You're going to Rampage Jackson's house, and you're going to bring him in tonight, okay?  And go.  Yeah, right now he's delirious, four days of energy drinks.  Go get him.  Bring him back.  Right.  You should have filmed that for a little, like, pregame show for the UFC there, Dana.  The reality is, though, he was the whole time through the whole thing, he was very cooperative with the police.  You know, he had 72 hours of psychiatric evaluation, and then they find out he's got delirium. 
[02:04:30]  So they treated him for it.  They made him stay in the hospital.  They had to put IVs in him, and they made him sleep.  So he basically, no medication or anything like that was dehydrated.  Have you ever known anybody that's been dehydrated before?  No.  It's pretty crazy.  Yeah.  It's pretty crazy when that happens to you.  Hey, before we move on to the Chuck Liddell fight, that's why you're calling today, Kimbo Slice, I've got to be honest.  He piques my interest, this Kimbo Slice.  But when we talk to yourself and other guys from the UFC, they're like, he's a joke.  Where are we at with Kimbo Slice? 
[02:05:00]  Do you know who he's fighting?  Do you know who he's fighting next?  Ken Shamrock, right?  Yeah, come on.  Who used to be in the WWF, but before that he was an ultimate fighter.  Ken fought in the UFC, too, and he fought in pride.  Ken's won, like, one fight out of his last ten fights.  Yeah.  He's 50 years old, for Christ's sake.  Is he really?  Yeah.  Heck, that's who they're putting him in against.  And before that was Tank, you know, the reality is Kimbo Slice is always going to be the toughest dude at the barbecue.  He can't compete in this sport. 
[02:05:30]  He can't compete.  So why is there always a buzz with this Kimbo Slice guy?  Because of the internet.  You know, you go on the internet and you see this guy fighting people in backyards.  Right.  And that's why I always say, you know, yeah, he's the toughest dude at the barbecue, but he's not an athlete and he would get annihilated in the UFC.  They seem to know that, too.  It's like they're pairing him up, like you said, against guys.  Like, didn't they want him to fight the guy, the Boston cop who beat him in that one match?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the Boston cop that beat him in that match is not capable of fighting anymore. 
[02:06:00]  Hey, Dana, would you ever...  Oh, jeez, really?  Why?  What happened?  He's messed up.  He was messed up after that fight.  That guy's been in boxing for a long time.  He's a good guy.  I've known him for a while.  And he's in no condition to fight anybody.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Ken Shamrock is in this deal with us where he claims he has one more fight with us.  We thought Ken retired after he lost the third time to Tito.  And, you know, the same thing.  We didn't think it was safe for Ken Shamrock to be fighting in the UFC. 
[02:06:30]  And you want to know what the reality is?  Ken Shamrock shouldn't be fighting in the UFC.  Ken Shamrock went over to England and lost to some no-name guy over in England.  And probably, I think that was about a year ago.  And you know what?  Ken might beat Kimbo.  Wow, yeah.  If Ken Shamrock beats Kimbo, that would be the end of Kimbo's slice.  Yeah.  Well, the last guy that Kimbo fought on CBS, they brought in this guy literally from the morgue  for Kimbo to beat up.  And Kimbo almost lost to him. 
[02:07:00]  You've got to be honest with Dana.  The ratings they got, it must have been a little frustrating to you, huh?  No, not at all.  We expected that.  The first time ever on network television, you know, believe me, we knew that was going  to happen, especially with the hype that was around him from the internet.  But I don't think they'll pull those kind of numbers with him again after seeing his  last fight.  Right.  Hey, would you ever do like a Vince McMahon thing and really get a little crazy with the  UFC, like do basement matches? 
[02:07:30]  No.  Yeah.  No.  You're going to keep it.  I don't know.  It's worth the...  Wacky costumes.  It's worth asking.  Maybe not wacky costumes, but, you know...  Gay moves.  Gay finishing moves that we saw.  You know, do a match on the top of a building or something.  I don't know.  Hey, were you surprised?  Like, I mean, everyone's talking about, like, from Russia, obviously, Fedor Emelianenko,  if I'm saying his name right.  And then the big Tim Sylvia fight, and he beat him in 36 seconds, I think?  Yeah.  I mean, that was a destruction...  Was I surprised about that?  I mean, I don't think anybody wasn't. 
[02:08:00]  I mean, you couldn't be not shocked to see the guy go down so fast.  Well, we cut Tim.  That's how Tim ended up over there.  We cut him from the roster.  And realistically, when you think about it, he fought Andre Orlovsky.  Orlovsky dropped him in the first 10 seconds of the fight.  We fought Randy Couture.  Randy Couture hit him with the right hand and dropped him and got his back just like Fedor did,  but couldn't sink the choke that Fedor sunk.  Tim Sylvia's been getting knocked on his ass for years.  Fedor went in and finished it.  So do you want... 
[02:08:30]  What's holding up this Randy Couture and Fedor fight?  Because Fedor is, for the people that don't know, for all intents and purposes, he's undefeated.  The only fight he lost was on that stupid...  That cut, what, 17 seconds into a fight.  So he's like the only undefeated heavyweight, I think, right?  I don't know if Fedor is undefeated or not.  I honestly don't know the answer to that question.  No, he's lost one fight, but it was on a stoppage.  It was a technicality.  They stopped because he was bleeding pretty bad.  And they shouldn't have stopped it.  Yeah.  Or he should have actually won.  He's an animal.  Who was it against? 
[02:09:00]  I do not know.  I don't remember the name, to be honest.  But it was...  The guy headbutted him, and I think it was a headbutt or an elbow to the head.  So the guy probably should have been disqualified.  But it's not a real loss.  Do you guys want that fight with him and Randy Couture for UFC?  Yeah, listen.  At the end of the day, I always like to see the best fighters fight the best fighters.  And there's only one way to find out who the best in the world is.  It's to have all the guys fight.  You know?  Yes.  I would like to make that fight.  I'd like to have all these guys fight each other.  Not just those two.  Is the holdup that he only wants a one or two fight deal, and you guys want him for 
[02:09:30]  a lot longer?  There's a million issues with that deal.  You know, you've got to understand, his managers are Russian, and when we were talking to the  guys originally, they're like, yeah, my brother is the biggest concert promoter in Russia,  and we own a piece of land there.  We want you guys to build an arena.  I mean, that's what we were talking about when we were talking about signing Fedor.  We're like, no, we'd rather just sign Fedor to a few fights.  We don't want to build any arenas in Russia.  What do you think about, obviously, the fight you're promoting is Liddell, who we love, 
[02:10:00]  and Rashad Evans, who Rashad Evans, I think, is undefeated.  He's like 16-0 and won.  He fought Tito to a draw.  Yeah.  And he's 16-0.  Yeah, I know.  And he's psyched for this fight.  He's excited to fight Chuck.  I actually talked to Chuck yesterday.  Chuck's in great shape.  He said last week was his last really hard week of training, and he was really sore and  beat up, and took the weekend off and said he feels sharp and fast, and he feels great 
[02:10:30]  this week.  So the Iceman's in great shape.  He's pumped for this fight, and so is Rashad, so it should be a good one.  And what is it, a week from Saturday on pay-per-view?  UFC.com, of course.  Yep.  Yeah, I don't know much about Rashad Evans.  I'm looking forward to this.  I can't wait to see this one.  Well, Rashad was the winner of Season 2 of The Ultimate Fighter.  Oh, okay.  He actually won at heavyweight.  This guy was beating heavyweights, and he moved down to 205 pounds, and he's gone undefeated  since Season 2 of The Ultimate Fighter. 
[02:11:00]  Wow.  What are the odds of, because I think Liddell is, I mean, people just love Chuck Liddell.  I mean, he's 39.  I mean, he still has some fights left, because Randy Couture is, what, 45, and he's still doing  great.  Right.  What are the odds of Liddell or Rashad Evans, whoever wins, getting a shot at Forrest Griffin  for the title?  Absolutely.  Absolutely, yeah.  Whoever wins this fight is in the mix.  Hey, Dana, is 39 too old for the UFC?  Like, all the sports, 39, you're starting to look at these guys, and they're losing a little  bit, but it doesn't seem like that is the case in the UFC, for the most part. 
[02:11:30]  In boxing, your career starts to decline at 30, 31.  Yep.  You know, these guys have more longevity, because they don't take the punishment to  the head that boxers take, you know, their whole careers.  And it just depends on your body.  If you can go, you know, to 39, 40 injury-free, absolutely, you can continue to fight.  And that has a lot to do with the skill of the sport, do you think?  Absolutely.  Hey, I did. 
[02:12:00]  Well, what's starting to happen now, too, is think about this.  Matt Hughes came from one style.  He was a wrestler.  Chuck Liddell came from one style.  Randy Couture came from one style.  All our big stars that have been around for a while came from one style.  These new kids that are coming up, you know, like the George St.  Pierre's and kids younger than him, learned everything at the same time.  These guys have been trained in mixed martial arts.  The kids that are coming up these days are just getting nastier and nastier.  I can imagine.  Hey, did Brock Lesnar fight again yet?  Yeah.  You didn't see the Brock Lesnar fight? 
[02:12:30]  He fought Heath Herring?  What happened?  I have no idea.  You didn't see that fight?  It happened two weeks ago.  Brock Lesnar fights Heath Herring, who is one of the most experienced guys in the sport,  and a big guy, too.  He's fought everybody.  He fought over in pride.  He fought in pride.  Brock Lesnar comes out, hits him with a right hand.  He knocks him back, like, literally across the octagon.  When he lands, he does a somersault backwards.  And by the time he's rolling back up onto his knees, Lesnar's coming at him like a train, 
[02:13:00]  okay, and hits him with, like, a takedown, gets on top of him, and absolutely hammers  this guy for three rounds.  I mean, the beating that he gave him was unbelievable.  This guy's the real deal.  Brock Lesnar's just going to get better and better and better, and I don't know.  He's going to be a force in the heavyweight division.  Wow.  So he came back strong from that first fight.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  I had no idea. 
[02:13:30]  I'm going to go check it out on YouTube.  Oh, you've got to see it.  Cool.  You've got to see that fight.  Hey, Dana, we love asking you.  You have so much effing money.  What was the last?  We do this every time with Dana.  What was the last cool thing you did with your money?  Did you fly all your old pals to somewhere cool?  What did you do?  What did I do?  No, I'll tell you what I had.  I think I told you what I did last time.  And this time, I'm hooking up with Billy Idol, and he's going to play for me and my friends  at the Viper Room in L.A. 
[02:14:00]  You just hired Billy Idol to play for you?  Yeah.  Like Jeff Spicoli.  Dude, that is exactly what I tell the Red Sox.  I go, I'm going to be broke like Spicoli, man.  I had Van Halen play at my birthday party.  Now I'm broke.  Exactly.  That's me.  I think we're going to have Billy Idol on the show soon.  He's a lot of fun, man.  Billy Idol.  I'm really excited about it.  Cool.  Bob Kelly and I, just a suggestion what you might want to do with somebody.  Bob Kelly and I went to the after party after the Griffin Rampage fight, and it was really 
[02:14:30]  cool, but there was not a lot of women there.  It was just mostly guys just kind of standing around.  You might want to just have some hookers at these parties.  That's my suggestion.  It would be appreciated.  Yeah, you might have some takers.  I'll start blowing my money on hookers now.  Yeah, well, just for us, because the comics stand there can't compete with the UFC guys  to try to meet chicks.  I have nothing to say.  And we're still waiting for our private jet to check out one of these big fights there,  Dana.  Are you guys coming to Atlanta?  When is that?  It's a week from Saturday.  Oh, that's the one?  Okay, is it in Atlanta a week from Saturday? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, I thought you guys said you were going to come to Atlanta.  You said you couldn't go to the last one.  Those two came.  My phone's not ringing, my friend.  What am I supposed to do?  Dude, you're in.  I thought you were already coming.  Listen to this.  I got this buddy of mine that lives in Boston.  His name is Alex.  This kid calls me, he's texting me 50,000 times a day because you guys said you were  going to Atlanta.  And he's like, will you sit me next to Opie and Anthony?  Will you sit me?  I'm like, dude, he's like your stalker.  This guy, I'm like, I'm not putting you anywhere near these guys. 
[02:15:30]  I would fly to Atlanta, no problem.  That's a quick flight.  No problem.  I got an old college buddy down there.  And we got a huge following down there.  And then we get to see some UFC stuff.  I'm in.  I thought you were coming anyway.  And you're going to see your buddy Chuck Liddell fight.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'd like to see Liddell fight, man.  I really want to see Liddell fight live.  He's obviously the guy I like.  Yeah.  Well, it's done.  You guys are in.  All four of you coming or just two of you?  I don't know.  We'll figure it out after the show today, Dana.  Yeah.  Whatever you guys want.  Done.  All right, cool.  Dana White, we love you, man. 
[02:16:00]  You're doing great.  You're doing great.  Of course, Chuck Liddell and Rashad Evans, Saturday, September 6th, live on pay-per-view.  Go to UFC.com, right?  Yeah, UFC 88.  And this is a great fight.  Hopefully, I mean, of course, personally, I want to see Liddell win this.  And I'd love to see him get another shot at the title after this.  Well, you guys are in.  Atlanta, baby.  I'll see you there.  All right, Dana.  Take care.  Thanks, Dana.  Dana White from the UFC, everyone.  Yeah.  Nothing.  I'd love to see that Liddell fight.  I really would, too.  I've never seen him fight live. 
[02:16:30]  I mean, I've only been to one match.  Live would just be insane.  Plus, you know, he's a good dude.  Does Dana pay for the flights or no?  Yeah, what happened there?  Did we talk him into him actually paying for the flights?  Are we private jetting, or what are we doing?  Does Kenny have to, like, get on the phone with the airlines?  I'm going to Atlanta.  I don't know.  I would love to know that.  Roland, figure out what Dana's willing to do for us.  Certainly didn't pay for that.  Make sure he knows that, you know, there's a lot at stake here.  If he does the right thing, we continue, you know, taking his phone calls on this great radio show of ours. 
[02:17:00]  And even if he doesn't.  If we have to pay for our own coach flights, then tell Dana to beat us.  All right, we've got to go over to the other joint.  Yeah, the other joint.  Later, dude.  Bye.  It's so cold in the day.  We have been this shitty since WNW. 
[02:17:30]  Here's what we do.  Every day.  For years and years and years.  Pissing in a bucket.  Cock blocker.  Fuck it.  Fucked up.  Fuck it.  Shit.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Assholes.  Eating a box of nerds out of a stripper's butthole.  And shitty.  That's all.  How healthy could that be?  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck? 
[02:18:00]  Whip on my Wednesday now.  Whip on my Wednesday.  Whip them out.  Tits come out.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, lady now.  Come on, lady.  Come on and open your blouse.  Open your blouse.  Flash your boobies and girls.  Flash your boobies and girls.  Show your melons to guys.  Show your melons to guys.  If you're not bang below the dashboard.  Below the dashboard.  Well, lift those babies up high. 
[02:18:30]  Lift those babies up high.  Woo.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Take on my baby now.  Take on my baby.  And flap them around.  Wrap them around.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, lady now.  Come on, lady.  Because that's what wow is about.  What wow is about.  You've got to lose that shirt.  Lose that shirt.  And let those fun bags bounce. 
[02:19:00]  Fun bags bounce.  Be those small.  For more sake.  For more sake.  Just let those jobs come out.  Let those jobs come out.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  It's so cold in the day.  Can I ask a question? 
[02:19:30]  No, you can't.  Oh, Jimmy.  Why don't we do, on this side of the show at least, we don't do like what's in your pants,  or why don't the girls call in for that?  There's a lot of stuff we're not doing.  Oh.  I thought about that yesterday, like we can't do it over on CBS, but why not here?  Because this is the call it in portion of the Opie and Anthony show.  Nah, he's got a point.  Not at all.  This is the watch the clock and wait for 11 o'clock portion of the radio show.  I think we have a lot of fun over here.  I honestly look forward to coming here every day. 
[02:20:00]  Well, know what happened with the what's in the pants, I'll tell you, Jimmy.  When we brought that great bit to the radio listeners, girls were still doing a lot of  different hairstyles.  Oh, wow.  And then what happened was, girl after girl after girl after girl, no hair, end of bit.  You know something?  I didn't even think of that.  Yeah, but we don't, we could get girls to call them with that.  So consciously also, we're like, wow, this is ending the same way every time.  Wood floor.  Wood floor again.  That's okay. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, you're right.  It's okay.  But that's what happened.  I think subconsciously, we're like, eh, oh, well, it's going to be a wood floor again.  Yeah.  What happened there, sir?  Well, something that I was thinking about just yesterday that we don't do anymore is  a version of the, it used to be the six o'clock queef.  Oh, yes, the queef.  We could bring that back over here.  Some girls are very talented at the queef.  Well, why don't we bring back the queef today?  Why don't we bring Cake Fart to the game?  Well, we would love Cake Fart.  Cake Fart to the show.  Yeah, Cake Queef.  When are we getting Cake Fart live in studio? 
[02:21:00]  I think we're working on that?  I do believe, on my PC in the back office yesterday, when I went in there after the show, Craigslist  was up with a search for brown showers.  All right.  So I do believe we're working on finding some girls.  Good to know the boys are working behind the scenes.  Look, we need some dirty whores to come in and fart on cakes and other things, like the  videos we were watching yesterday.  Anyway, calling all dirty whores, calling all dirty whores.  Bedelia, fart on my cake, Bedelia, you bitch. 
[02:21:30]  Right on, right on.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  What happened?  Uh, well, baby girl knew it was Creepshow and she knows no movie references.  No.  Coin City Yourself at home all night.  Oh, yeah.  Last night.  Oh, yeah.  It's running through my, Coin City Yourself.  And I'm like, I wonder if that's how she said it.  Or was it like, uh, Coin City Yourself? 
[02:22:00]  No, it's Coin.  Oh, she really did.  Oh, it's Coin.  She did the whole performance and it's Coin.  Yeah.  It was almost two syllables.  Like, Coin.  Coin.  Coin City Yourself at home.  Hey, uh, what was that guy criticizing the Dana White interview?  Oh, I don't know.  Can these fucking people, if there's a question you want to ask a guest, if we don't ask it,  can you call in and maybe it will get asked?  I guess someone's mad because, oh, uh.  There's always somebody mad.  Oh, it's Shirehorst from the Shirehorst family. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, the Shirehorst.  We like Paul Shirehorst from the Shirehorst family.  What was his question?  He's actually, you know, he's a good egg.  He writes, uh, boo to the interviewers.  He's going on Criss Angel and you guys didn't ask him about it.  Boo.  We, Criss Angel was actually supposed to call in with him and didn't.  We didn't know why.  We just didn't think of it.  What should we have asked?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So, you're going on a Criss Angel show.  Is there going to be some magic happening?  What the fuck are we going to ask that for? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  All right.  Well, I mean, we weren't avoiding it.  We were asking a lot of UFC questions.  Let's tell this truth.  We were scared to ask the tough question about the Criss Angel show.  Yeah.  We didn't want to get into that ugliness.  Wow.  What pussies.  Yeah.  We sold out.  We let Paul Shirehorst from the Shirehorst family down today.  Well, the Shirehorsts are notoriously nitpicky.  Everyone knows that.  They sure are.  That's right.  You want nitpicking?  Go to Shirehorst.com. 
[02:23:30]  Shirehorst.  Hey, a couple things.  Top 10 overrated movies.  I would like to do that.  We kind of hate these list things.  Yeah, they're fun.  We used to enjoy this, but then you realize that they're just trying to be, you know,  too cool and all that.  Yeah, look how cool I was for thinking of this one.  Number one, number six, number nine.  Number 10, I agree with.  Number two, even, should not be on this list.  You want to go through this real fast?  Yeah.  And then E-Rock put together some of the cringe moments on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:24:00]  During interviews?  As far as, yeah, us and guests go.  Yes.  You got Chris Jericho on here and Dak Shepard.  I don't even remember why that was uncomfortable.  You got the Ed Asner.  You got, oh, Linda Lovelace's sister.  Oh, that's a good one.  All right.  Oh, that's a cringe moment.  We're going to play a few of these today and a few of these tomorrow.  Richard Jenny's on here.  Steve the Whistler, The Rock.  Is that the original Rock interview?  Oh, shit, really?  Yeah.  All right, we're going to go old school. 
[02:24:30]  We're going to play the older ones today.  As people have heard, like the Chris Carter, Mr. DVD's on here, Ant.  Wow.  These are, you know.  That was an embarrassing moment.  I listen to the channel a lot.  I haven't heard any of those interviews in a long, long time.  Probably you play them when we're on vacation or I'm nowhere near an XM.  Because I know a lot of times when we go away and we replay things, a lot of times it's a standing rule.  It's pretty much been, eh, not many interviews.  Don't put many interviews on because, eh, once you hear them once. 
[02:25:00]  But cringe ones are good.  That's a different story.  I want to do the death show.  Did I tell you that one, E-Rock?  God damn death show.  Oh, I didn't tell you?  That was me dreaming?  Oh.  Next time we go away, like on a real vacation, one, maybe two days dedicated to all the people  that were on our show that are now dead.  Ah.  Okay.  Because the list is growing, my friends.  It certainly is.  It is a growing.  Coins.  Sit to yourself.  A corpse.  Ha, ha, ha.  Coins. 
[02:25:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  Here we go.  So we'll go through this fast.  The top ten overrated movies.  Number ten, Training Day.  Totally agree.  Why?  It was an average movie.  Denzel, it was decent.  But it was an Oscar that they should have given him for Malcolm X.  It was like a Scarface type of role.  It was like, you know, who gave a shit?  You know, the dirty cop over the top.  It was, not to say the movie was bad, but who gave a fuck?  I gotta be honest.  I never saw Training Day.  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, I saw it.  Jimmy's right.  Yeah.  Wow.  It was very predictable.  The cops and robbers shit?  Yeah.  Yeah, one of those typical stupid.  Was it a good movie?  Nah.  It was fine.  It was like, it didn't suck.  I didn't walk out of there and go, I gotta, whatever you do.  A chubby?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I did have that.  Number nine should not be on this list.  This is just somebody trying to be cool.  Reservoir Dogs.  One of the most overrated movies of all time.  That movie was great.  The dialogue in that movie is terrific.  What was the reason?  Did he give a reason as to what he said about it? 
[02:26:30]  Why?  Well, he writes, this isn't a bad movie.  In fact, it's pretty good and definitely entertaining.  But for all the hype that this film received, it definitely qualifies as overrated.  When the movie came out, was there a lot of hype?  I don't think so.  Yeah.  There's an ear got cut off.  He was going to set a man on fire.  This movie's on the IMDb Top 250 list, but the dialogue isn't overly impressive.  I love the dialogue in that.  And only a precursor to Pulp Fiction, which is much better.  And a lot of this film is based on tricks, like the non-chronological order and flashbacks, 
[02:27:00]  which are used as style choices to hide plot deficiencies.  What?  This is a good movie, but it's hardly a best 200 ever.  By the way, that was a brilliant move on his part, because movie makers weren't doing  that for the most part.  Yeah.  For the most part.  Right?  Yeah.  Like the Pulp Fiction was the same way.  It wasn't in chronological order.  Now it's easy to say that, because a lot of movies have come out with that same, you  know, tact.  Look how I don't like it, man.  I don't like Reservoir Dogs.  Yeah, I like the going back and forth. 
[02:27:30]  Get out of here.  I loved it.  You see how he, because it also slowly reveals things.  Going back, it doesn't always hide plot flaws.  Because something like Tim Roth being a cop, or whatever, can be like a cool, slow reveal.  Right.  You can't reveal that in order.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, I know.  At the beginning of the fucking movie.  Yeah.  What a bunch of fudge.  It would ruin a lot of things.  Then in eighth place, top ten overrated movies, you got Star Trek IV, The Voyage Home.  I have avoided all Star Trek movies myself. 
[02:28:00]  Yep.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Pangolin, buddy.  It's not as cold, man.  I knew this was happening.  Hello.  Anthony, Star Trek IV, The Voyage Home.  The Voyage Home is the one with the whales.  Right.  That one stinks.  But who's thinking that's like a great movie that it would need to show up on an overrated list?  An overrated list.  It's not a good movie.  There's a lot of hype because it's a Star Trek movie.  It's a gimmick movie. 
[02:28:30]  It's probably one of the worst of the Star Trek movies, aside from one, which really sucked.  Yeah.  How about give it to Star Trek with a motion picture?  Because that one got like a lot of hype when it first came out.  The cast coming back together.  And that sucked fucking total ass.  That was terrible?  Yeah.  It's like fire a fucking phaser or something.  V'ger.  They did nothing.  It was like they were trying to be like, yeah, like 2001 A Space Odyssey instead of Star Trek.  There's the Enterprise all loaded up with fucking photon torpedoes. 
[02:29:00]  Use them.  So then, you know, the Wrath of Khan.  That one's great.  He tasks me.  He tasks me.  That one I like.  And then Search for Spock.  Meh.  All right.  And Voyage Home.  Blue.  I never got the Star Trek thing.  No?  Nah.  It's fantastic.  Stay home.  Watch it.  Don't think of girls.  I only like the name Gene Roddenberry. 
[02:29:30]  Gene Roddenberry.  The sets just sucked.  Yeah?  Even in the movies?  I never saw the movies.  You never saw the movies?  Maybe a piece here.  Well, you have to watch.  I remember something about the whales.  Wasn't there a whale floating in space or something?  A whale?  No.  It was something about a whale.  It was a big whale.  Something about a whale.  It was a ship that sent a signal down that only a whale could answer.  Right.  Or else the Earth was going to be destroyed.  Right.  And they had to bring whales back because there were no whales.  They were extinct in the future.  Oh.  They brought the whales back so it could talk to the little machine and then it would go away. 
[02:30:00]  So that's what they did.  What do you mean you want me to talk to a spaceship?  Dude!  Dude!  Dude!  What did he do?  That's I think the third time you went after it today.  I love him.  Number seven.  I just can't get enough of doing Bob.  Number seven.  Another movie I did not see.  The Others.  What was that?  It was about someone who wasn't them?  It says, it seems like everyone loves this film but once again this movie is overrated. 
[02:30:30]  It's slow and takes a long time to play out with intermittent scares.  A fairly smart movie but not overwhelmingly brilliant as many claim with a legitimately decent twist but the balance just isn't right.  A little too long and boring.  What was this movie about?  Anyone?  The Others?  A woman who lives in a darkened old house with her two photosensitive children becomes convinced that her family home is haunted.  I remember that.  With Nicole Kidman.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Right.  By the way, they're dead. 
[02:31:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Her, her kids, they're dead.  By the way, anyone else suspicious that Nicole Kidman, now that she's not with Tom Cruise, could get pregnant?  Just saying.  Ant, I never saw you ruined it for me.  Sorry, they're dead.  You weren't going to see the movie anyway.  Speaking of that, little Haley Joel Osment, he's 20 years old and he's doing Broadway.  Broadway.  Yeah.  Wow.  You believe that shit?  Wow.  Doing Broadway, that makes me a little suspect. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  You know?  Have you seen any tabloid things about him in Girls or anything?  He's an actor.  It's Broadway, though.  He hasn't been connected to anybody, right?  I see gay people.  They're everywhere.  Sometimes they don't know they're gay.  But then they have dicks in their mouth.  Yes.  And they shave their facial hair and wear guitar shirts.  But they don't know they're gay.  I hope no one can see in my closet. 
[02:32:00]  When they're horny, the smell of chlorine is everywhere.  Yeah.  Wasn't he the one that was drinking and driving or smoking the pot?  Yeah, he did get a...  Was he smoking the pot and driving or something?  Was that the same kid?  I think so.  I don't know.  He got into a little spot of trouble, but it's finished.  That's all right.  Number six, top ten overrated movies.  Scarface is an overrated movie.  Overrated.  Is it really?  You know what?  Is it really? 
[02:32:30]  I've got to think.  It might be.  Even though I like it.  I'm not a huge fan of that movie.  Because I think it's dated now when you see it.  Yeah.  It is dated.  That's what it is.  There's no blood, really.  The awful clock in the...  Yeah.  Yeah, this.  Yeah, the awful clock with the big hole in it or whatever.  That is so dumb.  They couldn't notice the 12 is missing.  And there's a giant hole in the clock with a camera.  Because back then, if you had a hidden camera, you know, old school cameras were nice and  big.  I'm taking it to the limit. 
[02:33:00]  I love this.  I love this.  Yeah.  Big tiger.  Yeah.  That's my tiger.  Tony Montana just walking around.  This is a montage.  This awful montage.  This montage.  When you want time to go by fast, but...  Where's the fucking South Park montage song?  Because it's this.  Yeah, we got to do the montage song today.  This is the period in which Tony Montana is building his empire and getting his stuff  for his sister, getting her hair cutting place, his puggers fixing out. 
[02:33:30]  You're just seeing money being counted and coke and...  Buying a new car.  Yeah.  New suits.  It's time going by.  Buying a house.  But it's fast because it's a montage.  It's a montage.  It's a montage.  It's a montage.  It's a montage.  It's a montage.  It's a montage.  There it is.  Here it is.  It's a montage.  It's a montage.  It's a montage.  It's a montage.  That's exactly it.  It's the same song, though.  I know.  They totally did it on purpose.  You want to do a little bit more of the montage song?  I want to hear some of the lyrics of the montage song. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, that's all we got?  All right.  Oh, damn it.  So Scarface made this list.  Yeah, maybe.  It's just dated, really.  Is the problem with that one.  Although, you know, it's code in the day.  They love their Scarface.  Oh, they do.  They love.  That's right.  It's code in the day.  Yeah.  But we're watching Scarface again.  It's code in the day.  Number five.  Everything you touch, you destroy.  You give to her.  The mother. 
[02:34:30]  The awful mother.  Yeah.  She has to be.  Shut up, mama.  Take your money, Tony.  A lot of people saying that.  Yes.  Scarface is overrated.  Yeah, probably.  His sister with her fucking Sam hairdo.  Yes.  Do you want to fuck me, Tony?  Tony.  Got in her panties.  Do fuck me, Tony.  Is that what you want?  Yeah.  Look at the picture.  Yeah.  The same hair.  Yeah.  Fucking.  Primetime Sam Roberts with tits. 
[02:35:00]  That's me with my tiger.  Stupid chained up tiger.  It's all chained up.  The big dumb picture of him and Elvia.  Oh.  That's right.  But this was the video they played during the montage.  Oh, yeah.  This is the montage.  Oh, nice.  That hair.  That hair is hysterical.  Yeah.  It is just a frizz ball mess.  She should be fucking gunned down in a robe.  Oh, well.  Michelle Pfeiffer.  Oh, she was lovely. 
[02:35:30]  Pfeiffer was all right.  She has a P and an F in her name in a row.  Wow.  Look at that.  Just doing coke.  Because she doesn't eat.  Look at this.  She's just a mess.  Yeah.  Drinking and smoking and doing coke.  Looking hot.  Yeah.  Ah.  Shakespeare in Love.  Number five.  Top overrated movie of all time.  According to this dumb website that we'll give you out.  I see it.  We'll give you in a minute or two.  What is Shakespeare in Love, Van?  You see that one?  Shakespeare in Love?  Not even going into an incredible show.  Holy mother of fuck would I not see that. 
[02:36:00]  Is that DiCaprio?  Just on the name.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Let's just move on.  Number four.  Chicago was an overrated movie.  I'm sure it was.  That was a chick movie, right?  Yeah.  Musical.  You see it, Jimmy?  Moments of it.  It's about Wendy.  It's a city.  No.  No.  A boof.  Yeah.  That joke didn't go quite as well as I'd hoped.  It didn't seem to get quite the response.  Perhaps it would have helped if it was a joke. 
[02:36:30]  Yes.  It was more just kind of a statement.  Yeah.  That Chicago would be the Windy City.  It really is windy.  It was windy.  There's always a lot of wind in Chicago.  One time my hat was blown off into the street and it was run over by a passing milk truck.  Milk truck.  Milk truck.  Yeah, milk truck around my hat.  What we should be doing is the top five montages in movie history.  That's right.  That's right.  Rocky 3 had a great montage.  Rocky 3 had a good montage.  Karate Kid had the montage scene.  But 4 had a good montage, right?  4?  Which one was 4?  The one with the... 
[02:37:00]  He was training in Russia?  In Russia, yeah.  Oh, that was definitely a montage.  I think every Rocky had a montage scene of him training.  Of course.  It was like every single one.  You can't make a Rocky movie without the montage.  That's where the hit songs would come in.  Even The Godfather had a quick montage.  Did it?  The newspapers and shit.  After he shoots Salatza.  Oh, right.  Yeah, that was kind of a montage when they went to the mattresses.  It was a thing to do, though, back in the day.  Hey, Crisco is usually pretty accurate from Whackbag.  She says that Crash was really fucking overrated.  I loved Crash. 
[02:37:30]  She's absolutely not.  It was not.  It won the Oscar for Best Picture.  I think it's the best movie I've seen in the last 10 years, Crash.  Wowee.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  I didn't think so.  I fucking loved it.  I thought it was good.  But, uh, nah.  No?  If I see it, I won't stop on cable, you know?  Oh, I love it.  Number three, most overrated movie of all time?  Titanic.  Uh, I don't know about that.  You know something?  The whole fucking thing, the love story, this, that way. 
[02:38:00]  That's one thing, but holy shit.  For the time, that fucking CGI was amazing.  They balanced the romance with the action.  I thought it was, uh.  Yeah.  When the ship finally fucking sinks, that, that's a, that's a pretty good scene.  It was quite impressive.  Yeah.  Hey, but you know who was in that?  Bill Paxton.  Finger of God.  Mm-hmm.  Stupid Bill Paxton.  Why isn't that movie on this list?  Yeah.  You want to talk about an overrated fucking movie? 
[02:38:30]  Holy shit, thank you.  Twister was fucking, it was huge when it came out, everybody was talking about it, and  it sucked ass.  There was no point to the movie.  Yeah, see!  We chased tornadoes, man, we're tornado chasers!  Yeah!  Oh, God, it's blasting the music.  That's why these lists suck.  No, no, no, most people probably thought, it wasn't overrated because most people thought  it was shit.  This is not, this is not looked at like a classic.  They looked at it as shit.  But at the time when it came out, it wasn't. 
[02:39:00]  Well, yeah.  This, I think it got good reviews when it came out and shit.  They were like, oh, the effects are good and everything, and Bill Paxton.  Hey, it's coming this way.  No, it's already here.  Shut up.  Let's say hi to Steve in Jersey.  Steve.  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's up, man?  Hey, Steve.  Good montage.  Got over the top with Stallone with that cheesy song in it.  What was the cheesy song? 
[02:39:30]  That winner takes it all.  Yeah.  It was all, it was always fake, like, hairband music.  Yeah.  You know?  Oh, man, they didn't realize to get famous bands before, you know?  No, because it wasn't cool.  If you were a band, you didn't want your music played on commercials or in movies,  and now it's obviously a great marketing tool.  Yeah.  But back in the day, they're like, fuck no, our song, you can't use our song for that movie.  Hey, real quick, are you guys allowed to do Stoner Spelling Bee anymore, or what? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, we could do that.  Because I won the first one on XM when you guys, like, first came on there, and I want  to come back.  Did you?  How about starting next week, we bring back one bit a week?  That would be great.  Yeah.  Actually, we're starting today.  We want someone to do a queef.  Queefs.  We're doing queefs today.  I can't do that for you.  Next week, we bring another bit back.  Maybe it's Stoner Spelling Bee.  We'll check out some of the fan sites to see which bits they want brought back, and we'll  do a couple here and there, all right?  Thanks, guys.  You rock. 
[02:40:30]  All right.  Bye-bye.  Also, when you guys are done with this list, if you want, I have here the top 10 movie  montages.  Oh, yeah.  There's an actual list?  Yes.  Oh, fucking A.

[02:41:00]  Jeremy's looking ready.  What?  The worst montage ever.  Val Kilmer, real genius with some shit dick Thompson Twins' song.  Shit dick.  him in some uh what song was it now we need to know what song what shitty thompson twin song it  was yeah this one uh this is in the breakfast club have a montage too after they uh smoked  their weed and went dancing his little dance montage probably yeah i think that did 80s was  huge for the montage a lies by the thompson twins lies lies lies yeah see because a lot of 80s 
[02:41:30]  movies had uh the storyline was some uh young guy or girl maybe usually a guy uh had to overcome  something something usually the blonde haired son of a bitch of the movie that had the chick and the  bad friends and everything like that well he was rich rich kid yeah rich kid with the looks and he  had to beat him in either uh fighting karate skiing um uh some kind of race something uh and 
[02:42:00]  he had to go from nothing to knowing how to do the thing to beat the guy so during that time was  the montage he had to go from a zero to the finger popping champion right finger popping  exactly so that's where the montage comes in i'm sure the ladies out there are so happy that we  came out came up with the term finger popping finger popping nothing says sore vagina like finger 
[02:42:30]  bumming we're just the worst we're finger popping your daughters right finger popping jesus we're  sneaking one in the pink no in the stink sure what about the stink real genius had uh everybody wants  to rule the world oh it wasn't thompson twins it was that great band uh uh tears for fears for 
[02:43:00]  fears everybody wants to rule the world sure shout a shout get those stains out get it  i love the get it part uh all right here we go number uh two oh private parts  um uh most overrated uh movie second most overrated movie of all time private parts i'll give it that 
[02:43:30]  uh as far as accuracy goes it gets a zero but uh there were some funny parts in there that's for  sure yeah um again i don't i don't stop on it when it's on it's not one of my like alien or aliens  i'll stop on either one of those matrix movies boom i'm stopping gladiator boom i'm stopping that one  no i was just kidding i want to see how you were going to handle that okay it did get a lot of hype 
[02:44:00]  i think i handled it very diplomatically i think you did considering what we're going through right  of course i just want to see how you would handle that actually uh clerks overrated i loved clerks  no every other movie perhaps what do you mean kevin smith movie you don't you didn't like uh  no i like them dogma but uh no that was good mall rats i like them yeah fun movies what about the 
[02:44:30]  one with the lesbian thing um yeah chasing amy chasing amy clerks was very good though it's you  know it was supposed to look like that and be like that why was it why do they say it's uh overrated  uh sections of film that were hilarious but there were twice as many that weren't funny at all  even worse as any late night store clerk could attest these types of jobs provide tons of funny  and ridiculous stories that could have been used in this movie but were barely even touched instead 
[02:45:00]  opting for a lot of cursing and explicit sex jokes yeah that's what made it funny what about the  fucking chuli's guy coming in that was a great scene and who's this ass late night late night store  clerks that's what they're joking about sex and crap yeah what does he think they joke about  you know why don't you just have some chuli's take some chuli's gum  berserker would you like to make the fuck berserker that's fucking hysterical my love for you is 
[02:45:30]  ticking clock berserker would you like to suck my cock berserker berserker whoa guys fucked up  like he's just standing there commenting on him that movie came out in i think 1994  yeah and that scene still makes me laugh every time it's hysterical yeah come on sing it  i think we're gonna have kevin smith on the show soon promoting his new movie right  jimmy are you in the new movie did you make he's promoting our new film 
[02:46:00]  our new film our new film i hope i'm in it i don't know i'm gonna talk to mr smith more  montages top gun yes one of the greatest montages ever probably footloose weird science  had a montage i remember weird science was a fun movie weird science had a montage let me think  you know who's in weird science bill bill paxton was in weird science and he's spitting this and  he's known for what i don't remember what was bill's big claim to fame that was pretty much twister 
[02:46:30]  yeah i just want to bring you around to twister a few more times today it's already here  uh most overrated movie of all time according to list universe we got debris dot com do you what  apocalypse now wow i don't think you could judge apocalypse uh now like that  just trashed brando's part i disagree i loved apocalypse now yeah that's good i don't think  it was a very accurate depiction of vietnam i think it was more of a you know kind of an 
[02:47:00]  interpretation of vietnam it's kind of hard to make an accurate vietnam movie back then because  it was still a little too close um but i yeah that was a good movie i'd i'll sit through it if it's  on i'll i'll i'll pop it on yeah some great scenes that movie of course it was uh it was pretty  groundbreaking for the time too it was a very wide scope fucking war movie yeah 
[02:47:30]  i was uh joking about the top gun montage thing by the way blain l nothing better in top gun than  that fucking volleyball game gets me every time sends shivers down my cock that's what i was getting  at it you know that's why it was a terrific montage nothing but uh topless men homo erotic  and toweled men in locker rooms that is the gayest movie ever fucking made under the guise of not being  gay of being manly right they're all on a carrier just in towels smacking each other around verbally 
[02:48:00]  abusing each other see we got to do our own list like it was fighter jet pilots why would you play  this and not danger zone on a carrier on a carrier of volleyball scene tomorrow and all that stuff was  supposed to hide the uh the gay undertones the complete gayness right it's like yeah how do you  know there you're getting close because i'm getting hard it's like these are guys talking yeah how do you

[03:02:30]  looking forward to that  well because of the steve coogan thing that happened yesterday so  uh steve the whistler  what we said to the rock  i think i want to start with the rock stuff  the rock racist stuff  we got mr dvd  linda lovelace  the ed asner moment  uh a bunch of others  so stay there  opi and anthony  a little sublime never hurt anyone right 
[03:03:00]  no  any sublime fans  sure  date rape's a great song  what  date rape  are you awake jimmy  i'm so tired  my nose is uh  making it a little difficult for me  sublime has a great uh like a greatest hit cd that's wonderful man  yeah  he's dead  i know  he's dead  you know that blind melons trying to go on  without the singer  like 10 12 14 15 years after shannon 
[03:03:30]  shannon hoon died  no one cares  had one song maybe two  if you're into the band you like two songs  but they're trying to do it again  that's a little weird  know who was able to like not miss a step was that drowning pool huh  well we had one of the last interviews with that guy and uh and i think they're still doing all right  no way really  or am i thinking of another band  i haven't heard what what songs have they put out since he's been dead 
[03:04:00]  oh fuck maybe i talked to you soon i was i was listening to squiz was i listening to new drowning pool is that possible  what  possible  oh whatever it's not that big of a deal  huh  it's called soldiers  and and they're doing well right  drowning pool  they're on they're um  they're actually on their third singer  or second singer i'm sorry since dave williams died but  dave williams is a great guy man  we only i mean we only talked to him for like 20 minutes one day but he seemed like a really cool dude  this is the song  they still have that sound you know 
[03:04:30]  whatever  mm-mm-mm-mm  on your feet  who's with me  roar  roar  roar  all right 
[03:05:00]  yeah this was the one i was listening to  it's good stuff  i like it  all right  oh this is an older song though  sounds like a year old maybe  whatever steve's an expert he's got a guitar shirt on  i sure do  he's the expert  some instant feedback here where they  about his shirt said guitar queero  guitar queero  you're wondering to say that  play some guitar queero  steve you you made the uh not you personally but something you do 
[03:05:30]  made the uh the nine worst recent fashion trends for douchebags  this is from comedy.com  what's and and what is it  a dick in the buttocks  oh well  well nine is uh shirts that make you look like  make you look like you have uh  a full sleeve arm tattoo  they got those shirts with the shirt underneath it  that makes it look like you got a  oh those are  a full arm tattoo  that's a trend though right now  any sort of armband tattoo  anything ed hardy  what's ed hardy  i know that name 
[03:06:00]  it's a new  it's like a  clothing line that's  kind of gotten popular in recent months  retro tattoo i think right  yeah ed hardy is a guy  he's like an old school tattoo artist  and uh some clothing designer  uh like has licensed some of his  his designs and throws them on t-shirts and stuff  all right uh  it's huge  worst recent fashion trends for douchebags  according to comedy.com  you got sketch your shoes at six  you got the giant plug earrings  that stretch your earlobes at five  there's a reason why we're doing this list  number four  dirty white baseball hats  with cocks or beavers on them 
[03:06:30]  number three  hemp choker necklaces  and the runner-up uh  worst recent fashion trend for douchebags  there you go steve  shirts with flames on them  i have to disagree  wow  shirts with flames on them  is a huge trend right now  for douchebags  all that  okay  that's the ed hardy  sure  and then uh  lance armstrong bracelets  is the number one uh  recent fashion trend  for douchebags  this is um  list wednesday  i like this  no it was a quickie  because  because we saw that  it had flame shirts on  yeah 
[03:07:00]  all right  lance armstrong has that uh  scrotum that  the second half is stapled  over the cock  so the thing looks like a pig in a blanket  oh  he still gets the broads though fezzy  he still gets the broads  sure he does  they know there's only gonna be half a load to deal with  half to clean up  yeah they swallow a little it's done  all right here we go  uh  oh and a cringe moments  this uh  stems from the fact that  we had an uncomfortable moment once again yesterday  with steve coogan  certainly did  the star of hamlet 2 
[03:07:30]  and i i heard there was some uh  smoothing over that was going on after the show yesterday right  yeah yeah i uh  smooth things over hopefully  i don't know  i mean it turns out we have the same publicist  which i didn't realize at the time  but uh  i emailed the guy in la  and uh  he in the back  he goes hey man thanks a lot for contacting me and stuff  he goes stuff happens  and you know i explained to him what happened  i think uh people  expect uh  the radio host to be well prepared for every single interview  but the fact is on this show uh  not not not so much at times  yeah  not so much  sometimes we step in a big pile of fucking horse shit 
[03:08:00]  yeah  that one we stepped in with our teeth  sometimes it's intentional  absolutely  but that one was so unintentional  that's why it was so weird and confusing  at the end of uh  the first half of the show yesterday  but it brings back other uh  uncomfortable moments  now  a lot of these we are  are recent  so we don't have to go down that road again  but uh  you got uh  the rock  you got steve the whistler  uh  richard clary  mr dvd  linda lovelace's sister  i hope these are only cringe moments  ed asner 
[03:08:30]  i don't have to sit there too much of the interview itself  i hope  they look like shorter clips  so it looks like eric put this uh together pretty well  and then dax uh shepherd  one of the many guys that banged uh kate hudson  oh yeah  this was uh pre-kate hudson  like dax shepherd  i don't remember that one  where do you want to start  uh joe rogan versus daniel uh  how did  negron you  yeah  the famous poker player  oh yeah  what was that one about  that was about uh  his girlfriend breaking up with him  and joe rogan talking about 
[03:09:00]  how it feels to imagine her having sex with a big black gentleman  and he did this right in front of him  yeah  i think this is a good place to start  that was uh really bad  our friend joe rogan  he's a good boy  now do you think  now you broke up  or do you just think about other dudes  just gorilla fucking her  who fucking killed me with the laugh  wow really  whose laugh is that  hey that's nerds  sounded like a certain lunatic  now do you think now you broke up  or do you just think about other dudes  just gorilla fucking her  does that want you 
[03:09:30]  that's what i always think  i'm being honest  whenever i break up with a chick  the first thing i think of  is some other guy fucking stuffing her  into the corner of a couch  just fucking slamming it  coming in her face  that's all i ever think about  i think about her liking  you must  i think shit  i just let her go  and then that's the worst thing  that could ever happen to you  is you break up with a really hot chick  and then during the soft period  where it hasn't hardened  some other guy  there's a book called arousal  you should read  it'll explain what that's all about  it's honest  it's just natural male chimpanzee instincts  i'm so enjoying that 
[03:10:00]  come on man  you know it doesn't bother you  the idea of some other guy  fucking the shit out of her  not really  her loving it  her worshiping some other guy's cock  this is the woman that you love  and she's just got her tongue out  and she's rubbing her tongue  and she's coming in her face  and closing her eyes  it's dripping off her fake eyelashes  that doesn't bother you  it bothers me  and i don't even know you  one other thing  the guy's black  oh my god  it bothers me  and you're not spanking it  to that thought  what's wrong with you  oh voss was with us  out there in l.a. 
[03:10:30]  for the poker thing  that's a very good question  by joe rogan  it is  you don't want to know that  you don't want to  well unless you were married to them  for 10-11 years  right  well then i really wouldn't care  who the hell is doing what  the bigger the better  more melanin  the better  well that was uncomfortable  because uh  daniel didn't enjoy that  uh interview whatsoever  no  and we never heard from him again  and anthony's a big poker player  and uh 
[03:11:00]  likes these guys  actually he did uh  email me  he did  a while back  and said that he understood  that i wasn't there  and i'm a big poker fan  and i was the guy that knew it  and he he has a sense of humor  but he felt like he was just blindsided  he thought it was just gonna be  a goofy radio interview  he didn't know  like what he was walking into  i don't know  you know  whatever it was  it was still a goofy radio interview  yeah but he didn't know  it was gonna be that goofy  well we didn't know that  to the extent that it  you know  talking about his  recently ex-girlfriend  getting  banged  yeah  like that 
[03:11:30]  so i think it took him by surprise  he is a nice enough guy  he's a very nice guy  but so i think it was a little odd  that uh  he was even on the show  right  all right  uh  more uncomfortable moments  interviewing  people  which one you want to play  dax shepherd  i forgot what that  i forgot what that was  i don't remember  we might as well play  yeah play and see what the  awkward moment was  did you do radio  did i  no  i mean i've done it to promote stuff 
[03:12:00]  and i love it  you got the voice  really  yeah you got a voice  thank you  you've got  you've got the face for  um  hand modeling  no i don't know  you're a handsome guy  is what i was trying to say  wow we're off to a weird start  i think uh  isn't weird at all  who is that  that's dax shepherd  uh-huh  i don't know what he was going for  there  yeah  he's a handsome guy  he is  not unlike opie  maybe on the edge of the uh  why are you going after me 
[03:12:30]  i'm not  i'm telling you you're a handsome guy  you don't know how to take a compliment  i know  opie was trying to fix it there  you don't know how to take a compliment  as far as your looks go  well  what  if somebody  says you're a good looking guy  but it's a dude saying it  it's not  well that makes it twice as uh  creepy  no  a girl of course thinks you're handsome  but a straight man  telling you you're  you're easy on the eyes  that's the ultimate compliment  guy's confident in himself  okay 
[03:13:00]  whatever  it's kind of him what uh  picking you up  i guess  just being silly  then we uh  we have ed asner  the kristin bell hang up  we haven't played that in a while  yeah  what do you guys want to listen to here  linda lovelace's sister  mr dvd  richard clary  richard clary man  i want to hear that one  i haven't heard that one  yeah that was real bad  well  i think this was the day  the you know  back in the day  when we were just assholes 
[03:13:30]  to everybody  yeah that was like  what everyone expected  i guess  we had to adjust our tune  just so we could get some  like celebrities on our show  but we just  we were just dicks to everybody  yeah  we didn't even wait to see  if we could possibly get along  with the person  no instant fucking  in for the kill  this was a biggie  this uh  this became a pretty big article  in the newspaper  this could have been uh  our firing back in the day  this was one of the  close calls we had  because we actually  uh or i played some  uh some hitler speech  yeah  yeah 
[03:14:00]  and my argument was  like the guy  he's jewish  and he had no problem  taking a paycheck  from hogan's heroes  from hogan's heroes  playing you know  a sitcom  which is a sitcom  with nazis  in a concentration camp  manny gave me shit  about this one  what  manny dormant  because he was Israeli  i think it was  oh shut the  wait it was on manny's  radar back in the day  it was in the paper  yeah  yeah this was a biggie  he was very sensitive  about the holocaust  the owner of uh  the comedy  he was a great guy 
[03:14:30]  he didn't know much  about our show  so if it hit his  no he loved it  he loved the idea  of the show  i think once in a while  like that one  he was like  playing hitler speeches  to a guy  whose family died  he just  he was you know  oh it's robert clary  i'm sorry  yes uh  pierce mark  i'm sorry  what'd you say  i thought you said  robert clary  it says richard  on the thing  and i was just reading  i actually know  it's robert clary  now wasn't this  at the time  that the uh  the war was going on  well i was  i was born in 1926  and a war started  in europe in 1939  right  which means i was 
[03:15:00]  13 years old  when a war started  in france  yeah  when the german  occupied france  in 1940  then in 1941  we jews  had laws  we had rules  right  we went to wear  a yellow star  david  we had curfews  we could not do  anything  and suddenly  we eventually  we got all arrested  and sent to  concentration camps  and mostly  to gas chambers  oh my god  so i i have  like a 12  13 of my immediate  family was deported  yeah  and i'm the only  one who came back  i was lucky 
[03:15:30]  to survive  the three years  of spending  concentration  how did you get  uh  how did you escape  well i was young  i was 16 years old  when i was arrested  goodbye  oh baby  oh  holy jesus  all right  turn that off  one second  one second  well he was stupid 
[03:16:00]  enough to call back  how bad does he need  to promote his book  hold on  i can't breathe  hold on  i am mortified  i cannot believe  you play  you play  wow  i forgot  he called back  a couple times  yeah yeah  we were kind of  we kept getting him  back on the hook  yeah yeah  and he got back 
[03:16:30]  on the line  and that one  just put him  over the edge  and uh  wow  yeah  well the whole  thing was  the fact that  yeah  he uh  went through  this uh  uh  the the actual  real nazis  back in the  30s and 40s  and him and his  family of course  uh suffered  i would gather  from what he said  and then  an acting gig  comes along  and instead of  having some principles  and maybe thinking  that the um  the nazis  uh  might not be  the best subject 
[03:17:00]  for a situation  comedy  he goes right  in there  and collects  a paycheck  that's uh  yeah  that's how we uh  explained it to the  bosses back in the  day  oh yeah  yeah  still uh  next good story  uh  i want to hear uh  well we got  steve the whistler  still  the rock  linda lovelace's  sister  can i hear the rock  i wasn't there  all right  the rock was  uncomfortable  this was the  greatest 
[03:17:30]  blindside  ever  yeah  this actually goes  with what happened  yesterday for the  most part  uh  we didn't have  the knowledge  we had  i forgot his name  he used to be a  huge fan  sick boy  sick boy  used to be  maybe he still  is maybe  changed his name  because man  you want to  talk about  someone like  just disappearing  after this  sick boy  uh  disappeared  sick boy  ended up  going uh  i think  maybe  don't don't  quote me on  this  going out  with  and perhaps  even marrying  the famous 
[03:18:00]  babba  babba  spaz's uh  ex-girlfriend  wow  the famous  babba  babba was  pretty uh  all right  she was  tall  kind of  strawberry  blondish hair  and stuff  but um  yes  sick boy  ended up  uh  hooking up  with her  okay  they're married  i don't know  did they get  married there  steve  yes  they did  they did  they did  an icky  thing  um  you keep  in touch  with sick  boy  i spoke  to him  about uh  two weeks  ago  he's uh

[03:22:00]  going back to  sick boy  um i don't  know if we  were huge  wrestling fans  at this um  at this time  we were yeah  we were we  were getting  getting into  it yeah  but we figured  it would be  cool we have  the rock he's  like big name  kind of he  was on his  way up he  was definitely  he became a  lot bigger i  believe after our  interview but uh  we figured this  sick boy he runs  a wrestling site so  this is perfect we'll  bring him in  and when we're  like faltering  because we weren't  the greatest  interviewers back  then certainly  i think we're a  lot better these  days we can at 
[03:22:30]  least go  sick boy what  he got for the  rock it makes  it easy right  yeah and sick  boy knew a lot  about wrestling  because he ran  a wrestling  website yeah  there was a  website that he  ran yeah that  had uh wrestling  message boards  yeah wrestling  information and  therein lies the  problem yeah  listen to this  a showstopper  you're about to  hear a showstopper  uh we got sick  boy in the studio  he's like a  wrestling expert you  got a quick  question for the 
[03:23:00]  rock there sick  boy he's been  chomping at the  bit all afternoon  yeah i was  actually kind of  curious about  remember the uh  the mtv special  over the summer  they had uh the  feature on tony  atlas who was  your dad's tag team  partner i was kind  of wondering if you  saw that and what  you thought about  they they kind of  highlighted some of  the the hard times  that tony's gone  through over the  years and him  talking about being  so desperate that  he wanted to kill  himself and all that  and just what your  thought on it was  you know with your  dad being his  partner perfect  question there's a  good question  it's a little 
[03:23:30]  inside but i mean  it's like it's very  in-depth i mean that  question right uh  asking it's relevant  to the rock yeah it's  relevant to wrestling  fans sure asked by a  wrestling fan very  professionally asked  yeah the guy did a  great job well thought  out well thought out  right and how does the  rock answer oh well  here it is well uh  before the rock actually  answers that just out  of curiosity uh you  know the rock's heard  of your name and the  rock's got a question  for you regarding your  website oh no nervous 
[03:24:00]  i had no idea it was  you uh who is who goes  by the name of sick  boy but uh it was  brought to my attention  last night from the  office that your  website carries a lot  of racist comments and  i just want uh i want  to hear about that and  for the most part i just  want to know it sounds  like all you guys are  friends and if you guys  had known that this is a  guy who has racist  comments hold on hold  on website hold on do  we completely sell  them out here now  we don't know this  motherfucker yeah but 
[03:24:30]  in all i mean it makes  better radio if we were  selling them out i had  no clue i don't think  you had a clue either i  didn't know about the  the that the rock knew  that there was anything  like that but but do we  now go like because  here's the rock's point  he sees us all hanging  out he thinks we're good  friends with him it was  actually the first time  he had ever been on our  show live we'd had  phoners with a sick boy  but he'd never been on  the show so he was  actually sitting there  and the rock i guess was  under the impression that  we you know we're all 
[03:25:00]  buddies well he's in the  studio yeah he's in the  studio we're all laughing  and stuff so the rock  then uh well put put us  into the whole situation  with that and i love how  the rock just called  himself the rock all the  time yeah well the rock  and even when he's serious  he's like well look the  rock yeah wants to know  because the rock has a  question about uh website  and the rock was very  upset with it it's like  well bring him in we'll  talk to the rock here we  go there's a guy who has  racist comments on his  website and if in fact you  guys are behind that  oh i've seen his website a 
[03:25:30]  few times he's got a bunch of  writers on there and uh i  think they just open it up to  everything yeah i don't think  there's anything ever been  racist no more than any of the  humor that goes on on this  show  well now don't don't blame our  show  hey he sold us out  motherfucker yes he did  i mean i've i've never seen  one thing up on uh up on my  site that that would ever be  racist because that's not you  know that's not how i was  raised and that's not how i  would run a website 
[03:26:00]  well it's on there  oh i haven't seen it on there  if it's on there it will  absolutely  the rock says it's on there  but you know i i absolutely do  not condone nor do i you know  support  any of the statements made but  and if you know somebody on  there has made racist comments  like that they're absolutely  going to be fired  can i be excused  oh really  wow  oh  all right  well for the most part it's  one of those things where  again i was contacted i was 
[03:26:30]  made aware of it and the  the office was made aware of  it and uh  and quite frankly i don't want  to have anything to do with  you i don't want to answer  your questions and if you guys  have anything to do with this  guy i quite frankly don't  want to have anything to do  honestly i've i've never read  any of that stuff on the site  and that's the honest truth  you guys seem to be saying  look  dude i uh was scared for my  life i could hear it in my  own voice there  but now you're answering  honestly  please  the rock uh doesn't want to  talk to you  please  please  we get dwayne  right there  oh shit i thought he was on  the phone  no phone and we'd have told

[03:28:00]  man  you're still listening to the  show we had no idea  are you kidding me man i never  stop listening to you guys  no matter how hard you  threw me under the bus  oh that's hey you tried to  sell us out with the rock  there we just noticed that  one hey nothing any more  racist than these  motherfuckers  on their show  i don't know if you guys  remember he was standing  two feet away from me  yeah he certainly was  he really was there's a  video of it up uh if you  can find it uh uh  if you can navigate through  foundry  yeah yeah  all the old favorites 
[03:28:30]  foundry  you married uh buh buh  try and search for the  video good luck  yeah  so you're married with  three kids now  yeah  wow  that is weird  three kids  how old are they  27  yes uh two one and a  newborn  okay  all right  you just got started  yeah  well the weird thing is  that uh as tragic as  that day was for me as a  wrestling fan and as uh  you know sort of like 
[03:29:00]  hopes to be an up and  comer as a guest on the  o and a show um that  was actually the day that  i met my wife was uh in  the studio  all right  yeah  baby  was she dating spaz at  that point  yeah  oh wow  and uh i we had met  briefly once before at  at some stupid wrestling  promotion thing that spaz did  right  uh but it was just like a  real you know like brief  encounter  right  and uh yeah i don't know  it was just some just by 
[03:29:30]  sort of luck you know we  sat down she was there with  her brother and uh  we just hit it off  all you really had to do  at that point was make a  coherent point  or talk  in a manner that she  understood  and you were batting a  thousand over what she was  going out with at the time  good old baby  he really did live up to the  name spaz  how long did you guys uh how  long have you guys been  married now  uh been married for a little  over three years  wow  and uh they have been 
[03:30:00]  together since uh i think  like 2000-2001  wow  and whatever happened to spaz do  you know  i have no idea i've heard  by the way this doesn't mean  that spaz needs to call the  show anymore  he's dead tossed but i was  just wondering  rumors that that he's  actually a cop now  and that he's carrying a gun  no fucking way  i swear to god  i i don't know if it's true  but i've heard that he's a  cop in rockland county  so if you live in rockland  county  just pray you don't get  pulled over by that  motherfucker  you were speeding 
[03:30:30]  i have to write you a  ticket  nice  yeah nothing nothing  scarier than the thought of  him with a gun  and are you in the midwest  now  i heard he was working at  banana republic or something  i heard home depot  yeah  i really did  every you know  everything i hear about  him is different  uh i remember  he had his own website  for a while  he was trying to  promote himself  when you guys  first got on xm  well the worst thing  was the fact that  uh  he tried to sue us 
[03:31:00]  that was like the  the straw that broke  the camel's back  yeah  i was like what the  fuck is it  what  he quit the show  he quit because he  didn't want to be known  as spaz anymore  he wanted to be known  as kevin  which you know  and then  notice how quickly  stinky took over  stinky got right in  there  and then  stinky still  serious  i believe so  is he  we might run  into stinky  yeah  um  yeah the thing  with spaz  i mean  you know  it's been a long  time but  at the at the time  he gave his amazing  radio  and he just didn't want 
[03:31:30]  to be spaz anymore  he actually thought  he could be a producer  for a radio show  we're like that's great  but trust me  the spaz thing  is really working  and it could really  turn into something  no  and then he goes  i don't want to be  called spaz anymore  i demand to be kevin  kevin  or i will tender  my resignation  and he wrote a  retarded resignation  letter  yeah  i think we still got  that somewhere  and then yeah  i believe there was  some kind of lawsuit  that he was attempting  yeah  telling him to be  some lawsuit  and we're like  you know something  go fuck yourself  you're gonna try  to sue us  right  that is an absolute waste 
[03:32:00]  how cool is that  sick boy still listens  i know  nice  where are you living  in the midwest  absolutely love you guys  hey where are you living  god damn it  yeah where are you living  in the midwest  uh i'm out in ohio now  oh ohio  ohio  a city or suburb  uh suburb  oh okay  all right very nice  not crazy enough  to live in the city  all right sick boy  living in a very lily  white neighborhood  all right man  well keep in touch  do you still do  the wrestling thing  uh no i i mean
