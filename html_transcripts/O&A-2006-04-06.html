<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts engaging in vulgar, aggressive banter, filled with crude sexual references and comedic threats of violence.  The conversation then transitioned to their post-vacation experiences, marked by excessive sleeping and late-night TV viewing, including shows like *The Sopranos*, *South Park*, *The Daily Show*, *The Colbert Report*, and *Girls Gone Wild*.  They debated the surprising popularity of *Girls Gone Wild*, delving into graphic discussions about pornography and sexual preferences.  A substantial portion was dedicated to a scathing critique of *American Idol*, specifically Mandisa's elimination, mocking the contestants' personalities (or lack thereof), and criticizing the show's perceived reliance on demographics and manufactured personas. This critique included offensive jokes about race and appearance.

The show then shifted to a discussion of the documentary *A Headbanger's Journey*, focusing on Black Sabbath's influence on heavy metal and the use of the tritone.  Numerous listener calls contributed to this discussion, which included tangents about Kelly Pickler's physique, the replacement of Freddie Mercury in Queen with Paul Rogers, listener experiences, and a graphic description of the band Mayhem and their extreme antics, including the death of their lead singer.  G.G. Allen's career and outrageous stage behavior were also discussed.  The segment concluded with a chaotic attempt to have comedian Voss promote his shows, marked by vulgar jokes and the hosts mocking Voss's inarticulate promotional attempts.

A subsequent segment featured a call from Jenny, a WMMS call screener, which led to a discussion of photos of Hollywood Kim, with crude comments about her appearance and speculation about photoshopped images.  The hosts mocked the names of various radio personalities, particularly "Reno" and "Frankenberry."  Opie explained the origin of his nickname.  The discussion continued to upcoming phone interviews Opie had scheduled with Reno and Frankenberry, along with humorous discussion of the absurdity of radio promotional material, using a House M.D. promotion as an example.  A caller mentioned Voss’s ball-peen hammer joke.  Extended attempts to connect live on-air with Reno and Frankenberry, hampered by technical difficulties, eventually succeeded, with Jim Norton joining the interview.  The interview included discussion of Norton's upcoming HBO show, concluding with further jokes and ribbing.  The entire segment was punctuated by crude humor and sexual innuendo.

A lengthy discussion followed regarding the hosts' feud with Scott Ferrall and his Howard 100 wrap-up show, detailing Ferrall's avoidance of calls and reliance on pre-screened questions.  They discussed strategies to continue targeting Ferrall, including using the PalTalk war room.  This segment included frequent vulgar language and references to violence. A call from Doug, who knew about Opie's upcoming TV show, was interrupted by further discussion of Pest Radio 101's format change and the conflict with Ferrall.  The hosts described tactics used to disrupt Ferrall's show and his responses.  A listener called in to express support.  An in-studio interview with Sam Dunn and Scott McFayden, filmmakers of *Metal: A Headbanger's Journey*, followed, centering on heavy metal history, with frequent disagreements with Jim Norton, who the hosts claimed only appreciated Black Sabbath.  The conversation covered various bands, controversies within the metal scene (including church burnings and Mayhem's singer's death), and the filmmakers' experiences.  Tipper Gore's Parents Music Resource Center was also mentioned.  The interview concluded with promotional information for the film.  The segment was interspersed with off-topic banter, sexually suggestive comments, and personal anecdotes.  It ended with a bizarre bit involving water bottles and a discussion of Hustler magazine.

The next segment focused on speculation surrounding Katie Holmes' pregnancy, involving crude sexual innuendo and discussion of creating a “perfect genetic baby,” and a heated debate about 9/11 conspiracy theories. A phone interview with Corey Rowe, an executive producer of a 9/11 documentary ("Loose Change," second edition), supporting conspiracy theories, prompted strong counter-arguments from the hosts and callers, including a retired NYPD officer.  The conversation became highly contentious, with accusations of misinformation and strong opinions expressed on both sides.  The segment was punctuated by interruptions, including a producer's absence for an off-air interview, complaints about commercial production, and numerous off-color jokes.  Jimmy Norton was briefly absent, and Kenny (a producer) called in to clarify scheduling issues with upcoming interviews, revealing cancellations and mishaps.  The segment concluded with continued discussion and frustrated exchanges about the 9/11 theories, using offensive language and misogynistic remarks.

The final segment began with a caller, "Poe," questioning the official story of the Pentagon attack, prompting a chaotic and highly offensive response from Ramon. The hosts struggled to regain control, criticizing Poe's intelligence and the screener's judgment.  The conversation shifted to a critique of another caller, "Corey," with name-calling and insults.  They then promoted an upcoming U2 tribute band performance. A discussion about a package from "Dr. Steve" followed, along with a call from "Vaughn," who defended Corey and was subjected to offensive language.  A call from "Brooklyn Ace," expressing skepticism about the official 9/11 narrative, was countered by the hosts. The show ended abruptly with the unexpected arrival of Laszlo, a guest from the Ron and Fez show, who was questioned and ultimately ejected from the studio in a physical altercation.  Final calls briefly touched on the day's events, including further insults directed at Ramon.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Shut up.  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax. Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  I'm going to give you three seconds.  Exactly three fucking seconds to wipe that stupid looking grin off your face, or I will gouge out your eyeballs and skull fuck you. 
[00:05:00]  Beyond AM, beyond AM, beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  Now choke yourself.  Your days of finger banging, old Mary Jane, through her pretty pig patties are over.  Oh, my God!  Don't make any fucking effort to get up to the top of the fucking obstacle. 
[00:05:30]  If God wanted you up there, he would have very close your ass up there by now, wouldn't he?  One of the greatest characters ever.  Well, no shit.  No shit.  Hey, good morning, man.  Good morning. 
[00:06:00]  Getting ready for another fine program.  How is everybody?  Recouping from your vacation still?  I know I am.  I certainly am.  Christ.  I was so shot yesterday because we had the Rackin' Talker Talkers.  Remember we did the interview with the Rackin' Talkers, Hocker Mishers?  And that threw me off right after vacation. 
[00:06:30]  So I get home yesterday.  I don't even know what time it was.  It was pretty early.  I got right out of here and just zoomed home like a speed racer.  Hit the bed.  Done.  Out.  Wake up.  It's 4.15 in the afternoon.  I just looked and the first thing out of my mouth is, oh, I'm fucked.  I was just like, ah, that's it.  You don't sleep until 4.15 in the afternoon and then get to sleep at 9.30 again.  Or 10.  Doesn't happen.  No, it just doesn't work that way. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, dude.  I was watching some DVR'd Finally the Sopranos and then, ah, what else?  South Park comes on.  I watch that.  I watch the Daily Show.  I watch the Colbert Report.  I'm like, and I'm looking.  It's like, oh, good.  It's midnight now.  It's good.  And then you watch the Girls Gone Wild infomercial?  Of course.  Every night.  Every morning at 5 a.m.  Just buying that shit.  Every morning at 5 a.m.  Even though I've seen it a million times, that's how I start my day. 
[00:07:30]  Who the fuck is it?  Isn't there better, like, pre-porn available on the internet?  Yeah, but this is TV while you're having coffee.  It's fun.  Yeah, but I mean, do people buy it?  Do you know anyone who's...  No, I know.  The guy's made...  He has a jet.  He's got that.  I don't know who the people are that buy it.  And it seems like you could download Better Porno on...  Let's get our senior pornography correspondent.  I asked the same question to a guy I know who's in the business of selling those things, 
[00:08:00]  and he said it's generally people living in the Bible Belt area that aren't allowed,  quote-unquote, to keep porn in the house.  So it's not really considered porno.  It's just Girls Going Wild.  I got it off TV.  It's not porn.  It's Girls Going Wild.  Right, they couldn't sell it on TV if it was porno.  Right.  And so it's an excuse to have some racy kind of material in the house.  Uh-huh.  Interesting.  That is the worst answer I've ever heard.  It's a great answer, Steve.  It's a great answer.  It stinks.  It's a wonderful... 
[00:08:30]  Maybe he's strafing you.  Maybe most people aren't as desensitized as we are, and that's their idea of sex.  Right.  You're like, ooh, she's showing her bosom.  That could be it.  I think, yeah, oh, that's...  Whereas for me, if there's not a horse involved, they laugh at me.  Oh, I know.  It's gotten to the point where if it's going to be porno, it's got to be some real hard  core stuff.  Right.  If she's not crying driving home from the scene, there's nothing for me.  No shame equals no fun.  Right.  When you have to question if she's acting.  When you're convinced there's guns off camera. 
[00:09:00]  Wait a minute, those tears look a little too real.  Why is she doing porno when she can act so good?  Right.  Look at her crying.  I'm really convinced she's upset about this.  Oh.  Yeah, I don't know.  It just seems to me like you could get much better smut on the internet.  You can.  In very good snippets where you don't have to sit through some guy babbling to a college  girl.  Well, we're here, it's getting a lot of fun, and we're going to just take your fucking 
[00:09:30]  shirt off, show your snatch, shut up.  Shut up.  So you watched all those shows.  You watched American Idol, I'm sure.  Yep, watched American Idol.  First big surprise of the season.  You think that was a surprise?  Absolutely.  I don't know.  It's all demographics, my friend.  As you know, if you watched it last night, the big fat black chick, Mandisa, got thrown  off the show.  So she was thrown off the show.  But I think it's all demographics. 
[00:10:00]  I don't think, they did some kind of study.  Black people don't really vote for the show as much as white people.  And you had two black people that are left, and you're splitting the black vote.  You know?  So one of them had to go.  I think it's more than that, though.  I think they're also looking for personality.  It's not good enough you have a really good singing voice.  Because they even said Mandisa has one of the best voices as far as the season goes.  But she had no personality.  Well, then why the hell? 
[00:10:30]  You got Kelly Pickler acting like a complete dummy.  And Taylor Hicks.  And Paris with her.  Thank you.  Thank you, Simon.  Thank you.  And Bucky like.  Bucky.  Oh, Bucky's got to go.  Bucky can't sing.  Bucky can't fucking sing.  The guy can't hold a note.  He's all over the place. 
[00:11:00]  He's got the Southern vote, though.  Yeah.  So, I mean, you're right with demographics as well.  But I think America is also looking for the personality factor.  Because Lisa Tucker was also fantastic.  But she didn't have any personality.  You know what, though?  No, the personality factor.  I kind of see your point.  But it falls apart with Ace.  Ace had.  You know who had more personality in his eyes?  More life and livelihood in his eyes?  It's Taylor's friend that got the monkey lobotomy in Planet of the Apes when they spun him around. 
[00:11:30]  He looked.  His eyes looked more lively than that fucking Ace.  He sings.  That vacant look he's got.  The stare he's trying to do.  I don't know if he's trying to do this sexy look.  But it comes off like somebody who has got his goddamn brain cut out.  Yeah, he's doing that sex look.  And the teenage girls and the gay guys are loving it.  It's horrid.  He sat on that stool and sang the song the other day.  And it was, first of all, the country thing. 
[00:12:00]  The most boring subject that they're covering.  They did country.  It was, what is that, Tuesday, I guess they do it.  I watch it all in one night.  DVR.  Gotta love it.  One night, an hour, an hour and ten minutes.  The whole thing.  The show, where they sing, and the results.  Done.  Three hours worth of programming in an hour.  You're done with the whole thing.  Well, last night's show was what, a half hour?  Half hour.  It took me, uh, how long?  Like, uh, 13 minutes to watch.  And you were probably watching some shit you didn't even have to. 
[00:12:30]  All of a sudden, I turn to my right.  I'm like, do you want to watch Kenny Rogers sing?  Forward.  There was a no.  I said no.  You know, I would have went, zoo, fast forward.  I would have liked to have watched Kenny Rogers sing, but I saw him nowhere in that studio.  Nowhere on the stage.  I don't know who that man was.  It was not Kenny Rogers.  What happened to Kenny Rogers?  How much plastic surgery could one person get?  Dude, who was that man?  His eyes were pulled back. 
[00:13:00]  He didn't have the trademark Kenny Rogers hairdo.  And his beard and mustache even looked different.  What the, who was that gentleman?  They've tightened him up.  They've tightened him up.  They've turned a few screws.  Just leave it alone.  The guys that are getting the plastic surgery, it's bad enough when the chicks get it, when  they shoot that lips up with their, their ass fat and they come out looking like a duck  billed platypus thinking it's sexy.  It isn't.  It's horrid looking ladies. 
[00:13:30]  Uh, and then the guys have it done and, and they get their eyes done.  So it kind of looks like them with some kind of burn wounds on their upper face.  That's a great way to look at it.  That's the only way to describe it.  And Kenny Rogers, they, he walked out.  I'm like, who is that?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Uh, well, we got, uh, Jack in, uh, Ozone Park that wants to add to this intelligent conversation.  All right.  Let's go, Jack. 
[00:14:00]  Hello.  Jack.  Hold on.  Well, for some reason this is on.  Let's get our phones working first.  For some reason that's on CD2 today because that, no, whatever.  Do you guys know?  Uh, well, Jack, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Our phones weren't working.  So you were talking?  No, he's on hold now.  And just talking to yourself.  He's on hold to calm the fuck down.  Oh, he, you were, you were, you were, yeah.  You were, uh, chastising him.  Not really.  Uh, Jack?  Yes?  No one has really heard you yet, so you gotta start over.  It's Jack from Ozone Park. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  Kelly Pickler and Huff Fat Ass are gonna win this whole fucking thing.  Uh.  And you guys know that, man, it's just, it's got a lot to do with, with asses and what  you look like.  It doesn't even matter what you sing.  Like, I picked her right from the beginning and she's gonna win.  Did you notice, um, uh, on, uh, her performance Tuesday night, uh, she started in the audience.  She walks up and they show a front view of her.  So you get to see the people behind her.  Everybody's looking.  Everyone's looking right at her ass.  And there was some old guy who looked like Wilford Brimley. 
[00:15:00]  Staring.  Dude, he was staring a hole, a hole, a second hole in her ass.  No, that look was, uh, his surprise at actually filling up after about 25 years.  But listen, she's gonna win.  Hey, she's awesome.  Don't try the boss butt to get out of a bad joke.  Ah, butt.  He's still listening.  He's still not listening, I should say.  All right.  Thank you, Jack.  He likes Kelly Pickler in her ass.  Yeah.  There you go.  A lot of people like Kelly. 
[00:15:30]  A lot of people claiming she's, uh, putting it on.  The dumbness.  Uh, I don't know.  Nah.  She seems pretty sincerely stupid.  She's dumb.  Yeah.  She's just a dumb blonde from the, uh, South.  No one's beating Chris Daughtry now.  No.  No one's beating Chris Daughtry.  And he turned in a lackluster, dull, fucking country performance.  That guy doesn't want to sing country songs?  He could have picked an upbeat country song.  The guy's whole thing is about being, you know, upbeat and...  Yeah, but the judges last week said that he needs to show a little more variety, so now  he said, all right, pal, I might as well slow it down because I hate country anyway and 
[00:16:00]  get it over with.  Good idea.  I guess they got, uh, Queen next week.  It's not Queen.  Freddie Mercury's dead.  It's the remaining members of Queen.  Is it the cars?  They're gonna be singing with the new cars?  Well, Queen's doing the same thing as the cars.  Yeah.  They have decided to go on without Freddie Mercury.  They grabbed up the guy from Bad Company, right?  Paul Rogers.  Paul Rogers.  Paul Rogers.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Paul Rogers is now singing lead for Queen.  Yeah.  He's fronting a Queen tribute band. 
[00:16:30]  But he was a great lead singer for his band, Bad Company.  Why not just...  And other bands.  Get Bad Company back together.  They got hits.  Wasn't he in the firm?  That super group for...  Was he?  ...a year or two?  But now he's the lead singer of Queen.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  Freddie Mercury's dead.  He was Queen.  Uh-huh.  Brian May, yes, you were a great guitarist.  You had some great riffs.  You did some great things.  Very distinctive sound.  But without Freddie Mercury, where are you going?  Brian May has been...  American Idol, apparently.  Brian May has been trying to, you know, keep his career going ever since Freddie Mercury died. 
[00:17:00]  And it's just not happening.  He just gets various people to sing along with him.  It's just not happening.  George Michael came in, did a tune.  Right.  He gets a couple of people to pop in.  Celebrity singers.  And now American Idol.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  I bet Chris does a pretty good job with something.  I hope they give him a good song.  How many Queen songs?  There's like nine of them left.  Yeah.  Do they give you a song or do you pick one?  I don't know if you get to pick from a list, but who gets to pick, like, the better song? 
[00:17:30]  Who's going to get bicycle, bicycle, I want to ride my bicycle, you know, and who's going to get...  Too bad Mandisa's not still in the competition for fat-bottom girls.  Yeah.  You know, there's some pretty shitty Queen songs.  I'm in love with my automobile.  Who's going to get that classic?  I don't know.  And then who's going to get, like, the good Queen songs that people love that I can't think of one? 
[00:18:00]  Oh, how about We Are The Champions?  Right.  Bohemian Rhapsody?  Bohemian Rhapsody.  That's a tough one.  I think...  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  But I do think somebody tackled that last year.  All right.  I guess we're done with Idol.  People get bored with it, but there's some observations on that.  But I actually watched a movie last night, the first half hour to 40 minutes. 
[00:18:30]  I think the guy's coming in today, and I think that's why I was watching it last night.  Oh.  Got a little screener's copy of a movie called The History of Heavy Metal.  I didn't see any of it.  You got a copy of it?  Yes, I did.  What years are involved here?  No, it's a guy.  It's all the way back?  It's a guy from a small town in Canada, Sam Dunn.  Canada?  Yeah, that's the one.  What do they know about rock and roll?  This kid, well, he's not a kid.  Sorry, Canada, I'm kidding.  He's not a kid anymore.  He's been following it for almost 30 years, and now he decided to do a documentary on 
[00:19:00]  heavy metal music.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Does he go back to its roots with the black man?  And that's where I'm just very pissed off today.  What happened?  Guess who, guess what band started heavy metal?  Let me think.  Guess what band started heavy metal?  Well, I guess it has to be.  Guess what band started heavy metal?  Let me see.  Could it possibly be Black Sabbath?  And my eyes just rolled. 
[00:19:30]  I'm like, oh, shit.  You mean there was no heavy metal before Black Sabbath?  It was really interesting.  They did the roots of heavy metal, but everyone says pretty much Black Sabbath.  But they also contribute such bands as Cream, which surprised me.  Yeah, that was more of a British invasion kind of.  Well, we've been hearing Cream songs our whole lives, but we weren't around when Cream actually  put this stuff out.  So I guess maybe for the time, it was a lot heavier.  You know what I mean?  We weren't living in that era.  Oh, for the time? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, because they also threw Jimi Hendrix in there as a huge influence on heavy metal music.  Something heavy metal guitar, right.  Yeah, yeah.  And a band called Blue Cheer.  I think Blue Cheer or something like that.  I've heard of them, but.  And a couple others.  I can't remember.  We'll have to ask the guy today.  The heavy metal.  Well, Lars raised a good point.  It was really a beautiful induction speech he gave them.  And he said that no band has ever been associated with any kind of music, like as the poster  boy, as you will, for that music as much as Sabbath, that's your heavy metal. 
[00:20:30]  No, no, no.  But what other, what other.  This is what I.  Let's see.  This is the dream I had all night.  Nightmare.  You know how you have those dreams that never end?  There it is.  This is what I've been dreaming since I watched this stupid movie last night.  Can a boy talk about his heroes?  Of course.  Of course you can.  So Lars raised a good point.  And then, because I wasn't paying that much attention.  I was cooking dinner and stuff.  But like, there's a three-tone thing that musicians didn't touch. 
[00:21:00]  They just knew it was like the devil's freaking chord or something.  Really?  Or something like that.  This guy will help me a lot with this.  And Black Sabbath was like, fuck that.  Here we go.  We'll use it.  You know, but it was like hands off.  Like people just knew, you know, you just don't really go there with this certain chord  or something.  Than has come in.  Oh, you saw the movie?  No.  What, are you plugging a gig?  Yeah.  No, I have studied a lot of music theory.  It's the tritone.  Tritone, yes. 
[00:21:30]  Yes.  It was known as...  I loved that band, the tritone.  Yes.  Three tones.  Yeah.  And it was known as the devil's interval that you were not allowed to play.  And what is it?  Where can we hear an example of it?  Any Black Sabbath song?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, the only thing coming to mind right now is the very start to YYZ by Rush.  Those two notes that go between the...  That's a tritone.  Okay.  Wow.  I know the...  Man.  Do we have YYZ?  I would like to hear... 
[00:22:00]  I know YYZ.  Yes.  And then...  Of course, we have it.  Who the hell gave Black Sabbath props during this movie?  I think it might have been Rob Zombie.  Jimmy Norton?  Rob Zombie said, and I quote, I'll have to bring the movie in so we can play it so Jimmy  could smile and jerk off.  Black Sabbath basically came up with every single riff.  Wow.  And every other band since has just been reworking the riffs, whether they slowed them down, played 
[00:22:30]  them backwards, sped them up.  But I'm just sitting there going, why does he get this kind of...  Look, when you hear great songs like The Beautiful People, Marilyn Manson, that's very  Children of Grave-ish.  So here's YYZ, the first couple of seconds notes there.  Oh, yeah.  That's very Bell-like.  That's...  No.  No, it's the...  This song really does rock. 
[00:23:00]  That's really the...  Listen to the drumming of Neil Pearn.  Amazing.  Which is amazing.  Amazing.  Listen to this.  All right. 
[00:23:30]  I would love to hear the rest of that song, Charles.  What is the...  I heard on the Boneyard, they played a Rush song, and it ended the concert with a Neil Peart drum  solo, but it was...  I've never enjoyed a drum solo like I enjoyed this.  Really?  Yeah.  Anybody out there...  He introduces us as a professor.  I guess he's on the drums.  He's ripping me off.  The best.  Hey, let's say how to freak in South Carolina.  Freak, what's up?  Hey, man.  The beginning of The Simpsons, when they're just panning in the clouds, and the chorus  is going, The Simpsons, that's a tritone. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, really?  Guys.  Well...  How about that?  I had no idea.  I mean, you know...  I get into some of this stuff, and I had no idea about the tritone.  I just didn't.  And I guess it was one of these things you just left alone, and finally, Black Sabbath  is one.  Maybe Cream as well.  We'll have to ask this guy.  They said, fuck that.  We're going to start using the tritone.  What's a Sabbath song, if anyone out there knows it, that features a tritone?  I'm not familiar with music at all.  Probably all of them.  Maybe.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, what's up?  Pete.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Perfect example would be the beginning of Black Sabbath by Black Sabbath. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  Okay.  Okay.  It's just evil-sounding stuff that probably isn't as pleasing to the ear or wasn't at  the time.  Right.  It would come off like, oh, my God, that sounds like something that would be playing during  a Halloween party.  Right.  Or something.  The world had to change before you had enough anger in you to finally say, you know what,  we've got to start making music with the tritone.  Yeah, man.  When you're walking around with those cute hats, not baseball caps, you know, the- 
[00:25:00]  Angus Young type hats?  No.  Every little schoolboy, like, the propeller on it.  You know, like you're going to work for the old press.  You know, the-  Oh, the fedora.  The fedora.  Everyone was wearing fedoras and-  Or derbies.  And suits in the middle of summer and stuff.  They weren't ready for the tritone.  Where the president went for the inauguration with the big, what was that, stovepipe hat  like Lincoln wore?  Actually did that up until-  I think Kennedy did that. 
[00:25:30]  Kennedy?  Do you believe he actually wore that stupid hat?  No, but Kennedy was the one that got rid of that trend or whatever.  Of the hat?  The hat.  Yeah.  When it was blown off his head.  They say that-  Look at all the old footage right up to Kennedy.  Yeah.  Kennedy refused to wear that dumb hat that everyone was wearing back then.  Oh, was he the one that stopped it?  He stopped that trend.  And then, yeah, then everyone else said, oh, wow, the president's not wearing that hat.  That goofy hat. 
[00:26:00]  And supposedly the whole hat industry just drastically dropped and went away.  Just because he just didn't want to, you know, to look like that.  Can I say, I was watching The Tonight Show.  My parents get me my Christmas gifts.  Lovely shirts.  And a couple of other things.  No, no, no.  Different.  When did you get your Christmas gifts?  Like yesterday?  Two weeks ago we saw each other.  Not even.  They've been waiting for me in black garbage bags in my living room.  That's great.  Nice sun.  And they love you to death.  I mean, you really got to go see them every once in a while.  No, no, no.  I had brought the gifts up in garbage bags a week earlier. 
[00:26:30]  Garbage bags.  That's great.  But I actually want to wear a couple of shirts in for Paltor cameras.  They're just really good shirts.  Quality shirts.  And they brought me a Yankee calendar, which is cool when you're 37.  We have a Yankee calendar.  It's four months into the-  That's cool.  And they got me one gift I really loved was the Johnny Carson collection.  Ah, yes.  I picked that up.  And there's a great joke he does about-  Because he's from Nebraska.  And it was probably 1977 or something. 
[00:27:00]  It was Lincoln's birthday.  Oh, that was an impression.  Yeah, it was a little.  I like that.  It was Lincoln's birthday.  And Johnny said, Lincoln-  Whenever Lincoln's birthday comes, it reminds me of my first girlfriend.  She was in high school giving the Lincoln Award.  Because everyone took a shot at her in the balcony.  Really funny.  That was good shit.  Wow.  Back then, too, huh?  I love Johnny.  Got away with murder on that show.  Funny, dude.  Let's go to Chris in Los Angeles.  Chris.  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  How are you? 
[00:27:30]  Hey.  Hey, so the deal with the tritone, it was-  Hold on, sir.  Hold on.  It made them sound so dark.  What's that?  Go ahead.  Go ahead, guys.  Yes, sir.  Go ahead.  I'll put them on hold.  What were we going to say?  No, no, no.  We were just laughing, so I couldn't hear what you said, because me and Sweetie probably  were having a cell phone.  I was still laughing at that joke.  Chris, go ahead.  Hey, no problem.  So the thing that made Sabbath sound so dark was that the tritone is a flat fifth.  The most natural progression, the most natural chord progression in all of music ever since  classical days is the fifth chord going back to the first chord. 
[00:28:00]  So if you're in the key of C, the key of G is like how you finish a song before you  go back to the beginning.  And it's like just naturally in all music since, you know, for like hundreds of years  until the blues, where they started doing a flat fifth just as a passing note, which  made that the devil's music, because it's the most dissonant interval.  Well, dude, I had this discussion, Simley, but I felt that a flat G never coupled with  a C would work.  But if you pass it around into a tritone, which is supposed to become that it's a passing 
[00:28:30]  tone, but what happens is they laid on that note.  In other words, it was like the blues players just kind of went and then suddenly they just  said, no, we're just going to hang here for a while because it's an unnerving sound.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could you hold on a second?  I'd love to listen to you and stuff, but something, I don't know what the fuck it is.  It's so annoying and distracting.  There's something flying right over my head and it keeps like, I see it out of the corner  of my eye and it's flying right over my head. 
[00:29:00]  Every time you're talking, there it goes again.  Oh, it's right.  It's just over my head.  Oh, Anthony, you're in a band.  I figured you would tone it.  I was in a band.  It's called drinking beer and blurting into a microphone.  Yeah.  We haven't had one of these over the head conversations in a long time.  Oh, you lost me on, I don't know.  Well, you had me at hello.  Sorry.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  I could play you something some other day.  Bye.  Bye, fella.  Take care.  See, a little secret to everybody. 
[00:29:30]  We like to dumb it down.  Hey, please.  You know, I just had a secret.  Well, it was a secret to Chris, obviously.  And then in this movie, they said, like, if some of these great classical musicians were  alive today, they'd be heavy metal artists.  Really?  Because a lot of people hear the...  Nate Thovin?  Well, a lot of people hear the classical music and they think, you know, culture, they think  these guys were well-educated.  Rock stars.  Went through the universities and stuff, but actually, no, they were kind of the rebels of 
[00:30:00]  their time, you know, doing the music and stuff.  Rock.  Wearing their powder and wigs and the mole on their cheek.  Right.  I never understood.  Like the quality.  I always saw the first half hour of the movie.  It was pretty good.  And like I said, these guys are calling in.  One other thing I just want to mention, then we can easily move on.  There's a heavy metal band out there.  Because then it's heavy metal that goes into death metal and all that other stuff, right?  Little branches of little genres.  And the guy that's doing the documentary interviews his band, I forgot the name of the band, Mayhem? 
[00:30:30]  I've heard of them.  You've heard of Mayhem?  I believe so, yeah.  And Mayhem is a very unique band.  The lead singer blew his head off.  And then the rest of the band decided it would be cool to take some of his bone fragments from his skull.  Oh, you've heard about this?  And they all made necklaces out of it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard about that.  And these guys during the movie were just like, fuck you, fuck this, fuck, fuck, fuck.  We put out our own music.  And if you don't like it, fuck you, fuck, fuck.  They were the real deal. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, they were the real deal.  Because some of these guys, you know, fake being the real deal.  These guys are the real deal.  When you wear your friend's skull on a necklace, you're pretty legit.  Right.  How far does the documentary go into music?  Like hair bands or where did you stop?  Honestly, he was about to interview Dee Snider.  And I said, you know what?  This is a great place to stop.  I was just like.  Dee will just try to be funny.  Dee will make it about him.  It's like, you know what?  I want to know about music.  He was very influential.  Back in 80s. 
[00:31:30]  Our buddy Eddie Trunk's in the movie for about five seconds.  Is he?  Yeah.  Eddie shows up everywhere.  There's heavy metal music or hair bands or something.  All of a sudden, he's like, well, my adventure took me to New York.  And I swear, I said to myself, they're going to interview Eddie Trunk right now.  And it's just Eddie Trunk doing his show.  Yeah.  And saying hi to the guy, basically.  So he's coming in today, this guy?  I wish he was coming in.  I think he's just calling.  Oh, a caller.  That sucks.  A call in.  I wish he was coming in because I was definitely, it kept my interest, this movie. 
[00:32:00]  What's the name of the movie?  I don't know now.  American something, right?  Because it was a screener.  It's a copy.  I don't know.  It was the history of heavy metal or something like that.  Did that thing scroll on the bottom saying, don't make any copies?  It had the time code just.  Constantly?  Well, just on the top.  Yeah, I hate that, though.  And then it's a smaller picture.  It's not a letterbox.  Oh.  It's like just a small square.  No, the ones I get every hour.  A headbanger's journey.  Metal.  Maybe twice during the whole movie, the thing will say, hey, hey, you, watching this. 
[00:32:30]  Hey, don't try to copy it or nothing.  We're watching you.  And it's not very distracting, and it's great, and whoever gets those for me, thank you.  Here's Matt from Maryland.  Matt?  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  Hey, to add on to that story that you guys started to touch on, when that lead thinker  killed himself, I think it was the bass player, he actually wanted to be known as being some  sick fuck, so what he did is they took pictures of his dead friend, which went on to be their 
[00:33:00]  next CD cover, and to top that off, he actually cooked his friend's brains and ate them.  Yeah, that's the part I heard.  They actually ate some of him.  You know, call me crazy, but I don't think you'll ever see, like, Bono doing that.  I mean, you know, just...  Something happens to the edge.  He'd rather pick up a pen and a piece of paper and write out a nice song.  Write a song about it instead of just, like, scooping up a spoonful of brains, chowing 
[00:33:30]  down.  There are some people living the life out there.  But there's a fine line between doing that stuff and having real talent.  I don't know anything about mayhem.  I mean, in the metal world, they could be the shit they...  They could have a huge following for something.  Have any mayhem on the...  But...  I can hear a little mayhem.  I think when you have to go to those type of extremes...  Yeah.  Well, it's like the G.G. Allen whole thing.  That's where I'm getting at.  Yeah.  Like, I know a lot about G.G. Allen. 
[00:34:00]  I couldn't name you one song.  Of course not.  I couldn't.  They're not good.  Exactly.  They suck.  I wanted to like them.  You tried to like G.G. Allen?  Anyone that throws shit at the audience is representing exactly what I'd like to do.  You've seen the G.G. Allen documentary, right?  Yes.  I don't know how you're going to eat that banana after you've seen that documentary.  Yeah, right?  When he shoves a banana up his ass on stage, shits it out into the audience.  Does he?  Oh, it's...  And then whatever's left on his hands, he eats. 
[00:34:30]  Well, the...  Bravo, encore.  And G.G., a guy who's a fan of ours, I think his name is Evan, who gave me books.  He toured with the Murder Junkies.  Yeah.  He actually went with it like the last six months, like right before G.G. died, or a year  before G.G. died, he went out with them.  And it was really interesting stories.  He was telling about, you know, how he was fucking chicks on the road with his little dick and getting  pissed on.  He's just a classic.  Yeah.  He was a big Johnny Cash fan.  Was he?  Yeah.  Then they, uh, he...  There's a photo of him handing something to Cash while Johnny's on stage.  Wow, really?  Being respectful.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:35:00]  What happened?  Johnny thought he was on drugs again.  What happens to someone like G.G. Allen that gets him from that point where he's like  a fan of Johnny Cash, like handing him something, to where he's shitting out bananas on stage?  This was on tour.  As a Murder Junkie, he was doing this.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought maybe it was an older picture.  No, no, no, this was as, like, this is while he was on the road with this guy, Evan, they  went to his, I think, to see Johnny Cash.  He had to be touched.  And you had to be...  You had to be...  I think he was in all section with his brother, that's what I heard.  Oh, well.  And you had to be crazy to go to the G.G. Allen shows because, like, you weren't safe. 
[00:35:30]  No, you were going to get pissed on, shit on, puked on, blood.  Oh, no, he would just go right in the audience and beat the shit out of someone, too.  Yeah, that, too.  With the microphone and stuff.  Knock people out.  So, I'm like the G.G. Allen of Pal Talk.  Watch.  I'm going into the audience right now, and I'm punching someone.  Boom.  There you go, gone.  You're crazy.  You're insane.  I'm a mad man.  This whole show is like G.G. Allen because we just throw shit at the audience.  Then, the last observation, the first half hour of this movie, he interviews Ronnie James 
[00:36:00]  Dio, who invented the devil...  The devil horn thing.  He talks about inventing that, doesn't he?  But he says he didn't officially invent it, but he was the one that brought it to popularity.  Like, it's something that goes back to the olden days where his...  It's the Maloikia.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The old, you know, evil eye thing.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  But, so they're getting ready to interview him, and I don't know who told Ronnie James 
[00:36:30]  Dio this would be a good idea.  So, the guy's waiting for Ronnie James Dio to walk up, and his whole band walks up, and  I knew Ronnie James Dio was short.  I haven't seen him in person.  Yeah.  But, holy shit, how tall is Ronnie James Dio?  Does anyone know?  I've met him.  He's probably...  5'4"?  Maybe 5'4".  He's a little guy.  Maybe 5'4".  He is tiny.  Yeah.  And the rest of his band was towering around him.  I'm like, this, you know, I think you got sort of an image when you're into that type  of music, and it was just weird to me.  What's he supposed to get? 
[00:37:00]  Like, the kiss midgets to back him up?  Make him look tall?  Why not be sitting down and have the interviewer come for you, is all I'm saying.  When I was talking...  That's just one of my dumb observations.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  When I was having lunch with Tony, you know, Tony and I were talking.  Right.  And Dio came up, because I like Dio a lot, and he was saying something about how when  Ozzy left Sabbath, there was a weird thing about making Dio the front man, because he  was like...  Someone said, you can't have a midget fronting Sabbath.  Oh.  Tony said, that was...  Like, someone said that, and then they heard him sing, and he's fucking amazing. 
[00:37:30]  His voice is amazing.  One of the best heavy metal voices ever.  Hmm.  So, we'll be talking to these guys later.  Is your Breathe Right strip off on the right side of your nose?  It always comes off.  It's crazy like that.  It does what it wants.  Who am I to tell us?  Because I'm looking.  It's hovering.  Let's go to Mikey Cleveland.  It's hovering over your nose.  Mikey.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, I got Voss on the morning zoo here.  Oh, in Cleveland?  A Voss...  That's right.  He's in Cleveland this weekend.  A Voss interview on the radio station.  All right.  Let's hear this, Mike. 
[00:38:00]  And he got naked.  Yeah.  And he grabbed a bowl of milk and some Cap'n Crunch.  He's like, look, that's what I'm doing here for this.  Having a good time?  That's like a woo with a cigarette.  I know.  He walks in naked.  And, you know, and what gets me, you know, you all have friends.  You know, like, say if one of your friends was on, you'd be telling everybody.  Oh, yeah.  You'd be on the phone.  You know, I would.  Wouldn't you?  You wouldn't give your friends. 
[00:38:30]  If you need a friend with...  If you were on Dateline and they were like, Hunter got busted, you'd think I'd be calling  out my friends?  Like, dude, Hunter...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You'd be like, what are you doing?  You'd be son of a...  They're calling him.  Yeah.  She's sitting there in a Terry Cloth towel with a beanie on his head.  He's a little fourth-year-old.  He walks out.  He's a little beanie on his head.  What?  And the one guy sweated.  He walked for two hours.  Oh, God.  And this was the one guy.  What's he talking about?  He came...  He actually had seen the thing on Dateline.  On a Dateline prior to his head.  Oh.  He came back...  Or one of the guys came back twice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:39:00]  He called the same guy or something.  Couldn't get enough of that deal.  It wasn't enough.  Yeah.  I went to the good old-fashioned days in a rest area, which is...  I agree.  You know, one walking to the back of the other guy's head.  You know what I'm saying?  That's Liquid Park.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you over 21?  I will be in 30 days.  Well, there.  My fantasy still has 30 days.  You ever touch a crisp $20, though?  You don't just open my rest.  Ah, plus it's killing.  Bastard. 
[00:39:30]  You do the wits with a hammer.  You know, I'm...  You're just...  You're just in a romantic way, you know what I mean?  You're just in a romantic way.  Oh, yeah.  This little game is called Ball Peen the Victim.  Oh, my God.  Not in a bad way.  I just want to show you a little romance, okay?  Well, cameras are not romantic.  They are romantic when you're running, and you get nervous, and you're running, and I chuck  it, and then it hits you, and you fall, and then I tap my way with you.  Well, there's nothing wrong with that.  You're not a spider.  One knock on the head with a hammer is not going to... 
[00:40:00]  Oh, yeah.  Well, let's listen to me.  Look at that note.  She squirms a little tongue-tongue.  She's a kind of girl.  It makes it more fun.  I nail your head to a back.  Seriously.  I nail my head to a back.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  You can't actually do that.  No, seriously.  They talk about it.  With the Natalie Holloway kids, they're talking about how it's like white slavery or something,  and they get these girls that are on vacation.  They pick them up.  They schlep them off to these whorehouses.  They nail their heads to the bed because the guys like it when they convulse and shake 
[00:40:30]  themselves.  I swear to God.  Oh, my goodness.  See, that's why you've got to get a better translation.  You've got to pick the right place to go to.  You know, I want to go to a place where my head's not going to get nailed, okay, and  I can just be the nice, innocent white girl that I am.  We're in break 2006.  Woo-woo!  Oh, look at you.  You didn't do it either.  If the ever comment creeps me out.  I'm sorry.  Great joke.  I love it.  How about a shovel?  Let's not use any craftsman tools. 
[00:41:00]  Okay.  All right.  How about that?  Are you allowed to say make love?  You can say make love.  You can make love.  We can make music?  No, no, because it's going to be violent.  It's going to be violent.  We can kind of make love right on the edge of a cliff.  And right like I'm ready to finish, I push you off.  I throw a bowling ball at you as you're balling, just in a romantic way again.  Yeah, that's to show love.  How come you have a boyfriend? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Do you really?  Uh-huh.  What grade's he in?  He's actually in a lot higher grade than me.  He's like, uh...  He didn't finish high school, right?  He finished high school.  Is he in a band?  He finished high school now.  He works here.  He works here?  Yeah.  Oh, he's one of the DJs?  Yeah.  He's a DJ?  He's not...  What time?  What time?  He's on at 3 o'clock with Maxwell in the afternoon.  3 o'clock?  Blackie.  Oh, what do you mean?  He's kind of like Matt Lauer.  He's a ball holder.  Don, can you see Meredith from The View is getting a $40 million contract? 
[00:42:00]  I guess the color broad isn't the star.  That's all I'm saying.  That big buffet molester.  You know what?  $40 million could have come for her?  For some...  You know, a lot of light bulb.  A lot of light bulb?  What are you kidding?  That's a lot of hot dogs.  Yeah.  You got a little hole there, I guess. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, I guess so.  A young hole.  That's nice.  There's Voss in Cleveland.  We like to farm around the country.  I guess he shuts his phone off now, unfortunately.  Yeah, then we call his phone off.  We were trying to call him up.  Because it's really funny when he's talking, trying to get something. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, my phone's ringing.  I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.  You got to respect Voss telling rape jokes on regular radio.  It's good.  Commercial radio, whatever the hell it's called these days.  Whatever they call it.  Speaking of Voss, Voss tried to cut a promo yesterday after he was on our show.  This is, Rich is the dumbest guy I know.  Yeah, we figured that out yesterday also.  I was watching him cut a promo and it was just, it's like you're a grown man and you don't know how to do this.  And didn't you show your asshole or something to him? 
[00:43:30]  Because you're not.  In the middle of it?  Yeah, it's always a mirror.  I was saying to Anthony this morning, I'm like, there are things that go on after we go home around here.  Oh.  That you can't even explain.  They should.  Despicable.  The guys should just do a radio show because they're just pranking each other.  There's plans being laid and executed.  Things going on.  All the time.  I listened to the replay yesterday, by the way, after Colin Quinn came in.  Yeah.  And hysterical. 
[00:44:00]  Goddamn, is Voss just an adult?  Just an idiot.  And have everybody just sitting there waiting and pointing it out?  It was brutal to listen to.  And Bonnie, his own wife, just slamming him just as much as everybody else.  It's always funny when she tells him, just stop talking.  Yeah, just stop.  Oh, and she's like, yeah, he's taken, ladies.  After some dopey remark comes out of his mouth, which is anything.  Well, let's listen to Voss try to cut this promo here. 
[00:44:30]  Okay, this is Voss again.  Get your ass out of my face.  Wow.  Norton just put his whole ass in my face.  Look at that.  Wait, do that again?  He just opened it up.  He just opened it up.  Oh, God.  How can such a hole that small get such a big thing in it?  Oh, God.  It's the old rat theory. 
[00:45:00]  I look at the whiskers on the cock.  You've got to go with a boneless cock.  April 21st.  Oh, look at him.  Look at him.  He's got the worse ass.  It's like a little square ass.  All right.  Look at him.  He's got his ass out.  Read your promo.  All right.  April 21st.  I can't. 
[00:45:30]  He ripped open the cheeks.  He's disgusting.  I'll do it and you'll see my hemorrhoids.  He goes, it's clean.  I'm really hungry.  Yeah, me too.  I had the cleanest ass in show business.  Well, here's the thing.  He's always done.  No, it doesn't always.  I can't tell you.  No.  We were trying to trick him in the green room.  I'd say to people, I'd go, just bring a panty comment.  Just say they're good at something and watch how he'll be like.  I always have my sets like that.  No.  No, I'm saying, after you go to the bathroom, do you wet towel your ass, like clean it out 
[00:46:00]  with a towel?  Towel.  All right.  I don't know what they do.  Huh?  Well, I clean it out.  I get to clean this ass in show business.  I have a fake Coke fingernail that I stamped it out with.  Ew.  Oh, sorry.  That's a little ventilation.  No, that one doesn't stink.  It's burning.  Can I do these promos real quick?  Put your car.  You are doing the promo, isn't it?  You are doing the promo.  When, right now?  Yeah.  Oh, April 21st and 22nd, Redding, Pennsylvania.  I don't know the name of the club. 
[00:46:30]  It's just got to only be one club in Redding, so that won't be too hard to find.  April 28th and 29th, Northeast Philly.  April 28th and 29th, I will be at North...  No, no.

Oh, it is?  20 and 23rd at Caroline's of April.  April 20th and 23rd.  No, I got them done.  They know where the fuck I'm working.  No, they don't.  How many clubs are in Redding?  What's the big deal?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Huh?  I'm leaving this in as is.  Oh, okay, perfect.  Norton's showing his ass.  Oh, that's perfect.  That's some good stuff. 
[00:48:30]  Please just stop this and tomorrow just play this idiocy in this entire game.  No!  No!  What the fuck is the big deal?  There's a club in Redding.  I don't know the name of it.  Yes.  You weren't giving the dates.  You were like, yeah.  I gave the date, the 21st and 22nd of Redding in Redding.  Of Redding.  I'm Redding.  I'm Redding.  I'm able to.  You know, give the club, give the date, how to get tickets, where to go for more information,  maybe a website.  You know, you're all over the place.  You're so brilliant.  And then, what happens? 
[00:49:00]  All right.  Here's how you do it, folks.  April 21st and 22nd.  Redding, Pennsylvania.  I don't know.  It's a comedy.  It's at a fucking hotel.  I know it's at a hotel.  A hotel!  What?  How many clubs are in Redding?  Why would you get confused?  No, I'm not going to make up a name because then I'll go to the wrong place.  There's only one.  That's true.  There's only one club.  And I didn't even want to bug.  I didn't even want to.  I didn't want to even plug this one because they fired. 
[00:49:30]  You know what?  I was going to bring my own emcee, right?  Bring our own emcee.  And I said, you know, let's split the course.  We should have a baby that can be our emcee.  Here's the thing.  So, listen to this.  I wanted to split the course with the emcee.  $300.  I was going to give him $150 and the club $150.  And fucking this guy, Dave, started, no, I'm not going to pay for an emcee.  But they have a door.  Mike, he's going to play the game.  I don't care if I'm telling the truth.  They'd rather have their door guy. 
[00:50:00]  Their door guy host it instead of, ah, fuck.  Okay, so April 21 and 22, Reading.  April 28, 29, Northeast Philly.  I bet so.  Comedy Cabaret in May 12th and 11th, or 12th and 13th, downtown.  I got some real gigs, too.  I got some big gigs, too, coming up.  We got some improvs and shit, you know.  Which ones?  I don't fucking know.  I don't have the dates with me.  This is good enough.  They know where I'll be.  Probably isn't going to help you.  This isn't going to help?  It's going to help.  He knows it's recording.  He won't move. 
[00:50:30]  You think he just talks to this recording?  Yeah.  You should see when the camera...  Holy crap.  Oh, you cut the part.  I cut a gasser at the end and Voss almost threw up.  I wish that didn't get cut.  On the way out, I cut a gasser.  He's like...  Is he not the dumbest guy ever?  Holy shit.  That is unbelievable.  They'll find me.  They'll find me.  It's in a hotel.  That's how we pay our guys, is, you know, to obviously have them plug the shit out of their  comedy gigs.  We don't have money to give Voss and these people when they come in, but what we do 
[00:51:00]  is, you know, plug and promote their shows like crazy.  Help them out.  So the opportunity is to go into the studio with Steve after the show and get your dates  out.  Right.  All the info.  Where you're playing, what the name of the club is, how you get tickets.  And then the fans show up.  And then, you know, that's where you reap the benefits from doing this program.  There you go.  Trickle down theory.  I do a good promotion.  I always get the info.  I have a Poughkeepsie promotion.  Your Poughkeepsie promotion is one of the funniest ones I've ever heard.  I was listening on the replay. 
[00:51:30]  It is so funny.  You are a complete ass.  Can we hear that?  It's good.  It's professional.  I love the ending is my favorite part.  I actually don't remember the ending.  All right.  Let's hear this.  Hey, Paul Keepsie.  This is Jim Norton.  I'm heading up to perform at Bananas Friday and Saturday, April 7 to 8 of 06.  Friday, Saturday.  The number here is 845-462-3333.  That's 845-462-3333. 
[00:52:00]  Well, you can get tickets from TicketWeb.com.  I'm not kidding.  Bananas in Poughkeepsie, Friday and Saturday, April 7th and 8th of 06.  Each night there's going to be two shows and...  That's a perfect one.  Poughkeepsie.  Sweet, sweet, sweet.  See, that's a perfect one.  Very funny.  It gets everyone's attention.  It's, you know, stupid regular radio. 
[00:52:30]  You know, they have to play it straight.  Yeah, have fun with it, man.  And you got all the info out and people will be in Poughkeepsie.  I heard that last night and I was just cracking up like an idiot at a commercial.  Let's say hi to Ramon in Canada.  Ramon, that promo, Jim, by the way, was hilarious.  Did you guys pick up on Voss saying how many countries in Allentown or wherever he was talking about?  In Reading or whatever?  Yeah.  How many countries are there?  My favorite flub today, though, I forgot to point out, Anthony made a good one, where 
[00:53:00]  you said I watched, uh...  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  The Colbert Report.  Yes.  And you left the T off at the report.  Isn't that funny?  Did you mean to do that?  They call it that.  Oh, they do?  Okay.  I thought it was a mistake.  Stephen Colbert with a T.  She did not...  I thought you flubbed.  No, no, no.  He never flubs.  He never flubs.  It is...  I do flub indeed, but...  Only when you're on the Vicodin.  It's hysterical that his name is Colbert and it's spelled Colbert. 
[00:53:30]  And it's the Colbert Report.  Okay.  But since it's Colbert, it's the Colbert Report.  He goes, it's the Colbert Report with an exclusive report.  We're still...  Are they even listening?  It's very funny.  I don't even know.  I have to...  I have to over-explain that I didn't flub.  Okay.  I didn't know.  I'm glad I didn't mention it in the moment.  I would have gotten a good teeth smashing.  I just casually mentioned it later and now I am not humiliated.  All right.  Jenny in Cleveland.  Let's go listen to Black Sabbath.  All right, you guys.  Hold on. 
[00:54:00]  I can't hear you.  I'm a call-screener.  Hey!  Oh, God.  Hey!  I didn't know better.  I think Jimmy was testing his headphones.  Testing the headphones.  Go ahead.  All right, Jenny.  All right.  So, I'm a call-screener at the station he's at right now.  Yeah.  And he just put in that O&A plug, made no eye contact with anyone, just did it, tried  to be so sneaky with it.  What did he do?  When he was saying that he was engaged to Jim Norton for a while and he was kind of plushy  and then he said, you know, like most O&A fans. 
[00:54:30]  All right.  Wait, you were in studio while Voss was there?  Yeah.  No, I'm in the call-screening room right now.  Oh, you're screening the calls?  Yeah.  Were there any pests falling up trying to get through?  No.  I'm kind of nervous about it.  What's the radio show?  It's, uh...  I'm afraid to say, because I know the pests and I know they'll call.  No, they love Voss.  They love Voss.  Yeah, give them a plug.  They got one of our guys on.  They seem like they're all right.  They had fun.  All right.  It's WMMS.  MMS in Cleveland? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  That's...  That's the chick that was on the show?  The blonde chick with the boobs?  All right.  Jenny?  Jenny.  She, uh...  There's, uh...  Voss was hitting...  Wait.  Is this Jenny?  No, that's Hollywood Kim.  Yeah.  Hollywood what?  Hollywood Kim.  No, no.  Hollywood's the blonde.  Hollywood Kim?  She's the blonde, and she's, like, naked on the website, kind of?  Holding her titties?  She's covered, but yeah, she's pretty.  Are those implants?  No, no. 
[00:55:30]  Wow.  They kind of look around.  Oh, but then you got that picture.  What happened to that?  Let me see the other picture.  Then that's the problem picture.  Wait, let me see.  Oh, wow.  She went from Hollywood Kim to Sacramento Betty.  She went from a 10 to, like, a 6 1⁄2.  What happened there?  How did they do that?  How could that be the same girl?  All right, let me think.  Her hair.  Can we get this up on the website?  Dude, look at her hair.  It is making more of a V shape with her face, right?  Go to the other picture, please.  She looks sort of, hold on, because it's radio.  Hold on, go back.  She sort of looks like Jenna Jameson right there, right? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, a plainer version of Jenna Jameson, but hot.  She looks very hot.  Right.  Blonde.  All right, and then you go to this next picture of the same girl.  That's the same girl?  She's actually cute in that picture, though.  I think this sweatshirt makes her look bigger than she is.  She's actually cute just being silly.  That's not a bad shot.  She looks like some college chick you bang at a mixer.  Yeah.  Tell her to lose the sweatshirts.  All right, I'll let her know.  I think it's just a sweatshirt.  I actually think when you look at her face, her face doesn't look fat, her neck doesn't  look fat. 
[00:56:30]  That's just a bad shot of her.  You can still see she's good looking.  You know what the best thing about that picture is, though?  Mouth's open?  Yeah.  That and the fact that it's a pure white background and Photoshop's that much easier, kids.  Oh, yeah.  With the mouth open?  Yeah.  You can take her out of that shot and put her anywhere.  Yeah, you can put anything in that mouth.  You can put the whole Duke lacrosse team behind her.  All right.  All right.  That's a little Photoshop project today.  Actually, if she wore that, the Duke lacrosse team wouldn't even bat an eye. 
[00:57:00]  No.  They would still be playing their lacrosse.  They'd be having fun winning games.  Get that picture up in whack bag Photoshop.  Get on it.  They would have a good practice that day.  All right.  Well, that's pretty cool, Jenny.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  You work at a radio station, but are you a fan of our program?  You got the XM or no?  Oh, I have the XM, of course.  Thank you.  It's like all of radio has the XM.  Yeah.  Cool.  That's good.  Tell Vos we said hi and we were listening to him.  I'll let him know.  All right.  Thanks, Jenny.  Bye, Jenny.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, by the way, she is so fucking fired. 
[00:57:30]  You think?  Yeah, you can't just call our show for another staging.  You think fucking PD's like that?  She gave him a nice plug, though.  Is it true that you called the opiate?  Yeah, I thought, okay.  Pack your shoes, your shit.  You're out of here.  Man.  Man, as the PD mumbles as he's walking out.  Fucking people think they could just fucking...  Haram, haram.  I got to do a phoner, actually.  What?  I got to do a phoner in a little while.  A phoner?  Well, you know you're doing it right from here.  Can we all... 
[00:58:00]  Can you do it from here and we'll just listen in?  We'll listen in.  We won't say a word.  I love your phoners.  I have to do...  I hate doing commercial radio phoners.  What show are you talking about?  What is it?  I'm going to go over and make sure that none of these are bad.  That's what I have to do now.  What is it?  What?  What?  I have to make sure none of them are bad.  None of what are bad?  The radio show is like...  Oh, none of them bad.  I thought you meant that you had your material.  He's looking for one lousy show on that piece of paper that doesn't...  We're not brawling with.  No.  Reno and Frankenberry?  What?  Stop it. 
[00:58:30]  That's not a name.  Oh, it is.  Frankenberry?  Reno and Frankenberry.  Reno and Frankenberry?  Yeah.  And then I have to do one for Shrek.  You know Shrek?  Do we like Shrek or no?  The cartoon character?  Shrek.  No.  That's the only Shrek I know.  Okay, good.  Not Shrek and Regan.  I'm thinking of that.  No, Shrek and Regan are all right.  That's Shred.  Shrek is the big green ogre.  Okay, different guy.  Well, ogre.  Okay.  Shrek, though.  That name sounds familiar in radio.  Yeah, I know.  Well, it's a taped interview.  It's actually for tonight for tomorrow.  All right.  You know, it's gotten to the point where Opie is like Bob. 
[00:59:00]  Why?  Radio names.  Like, you used to be upset.  You still say something like, ah, it's just a name that I had when I was growing up, you  know, and stuff.  Opie's nothing now.  When there are...  Hold on.  When Frankenberry is out there...  Hold on.  I wouldn't worry about Opie.  But I'll tell you why.  I diffused it.  I openly admit I have the worst fucking name, and it's not a radio name.  But it's not anymore.  It's not.  It's not a radio name.  Dude, Frankenberry's out there making your name fine. 
[00:59:30]  There was a little girl named Julie Burson that stood me up in front of the class and  said, you need a nickname.  Bitch.  And it was either going to be Howdy Doody, Will Robinson.  Will Robinson and Anthony.  Howdy Doody and Anthony.  Eagle Eyes, because I wore glasses back then.  Eagle Eyes and Anthony.  Before the LASIK.  And then she goes, I know, Opie.  That's how it happened.  I was the only kid that didn't have a nickname, and they gave me a nickname as the teacher.  Could have been worse.  Could have been Shit Pants and Anthony. 
[01:00:00]  Expect a subpoena from her now to Sue, since you admitted that she gave you your radio name  and gave you millions.  She's like, she's got a little fame because of it.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Within the Harborfields high school circle, she's well known for giving me my nickname.  Her, you, and Mariah Carey.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Holy Trinity.  Do you know Woodman in the Morning?  Woodman in the Morning.  Because you wake up with wood.  Woodman in the...  I don't even get that.  No, I don't know Woodman. 
[01:00:30]  How about the Mark Bulger show?  You're waking up with wood.  Wood.  Wake up with wood.  Woodman in the Morning.  Morning Woodman.  Is this Frankenberry?  That awful picture with the fucking paddling behind him?  Wait, which one is...  It is Frankenberry.  Just stop.  No, the Frankenberry is the white guy.  That's Reno.  Reno's a...  Reno's a...  No.  Reno's a...  No.  I heard he's a nice guy.  I don't think he is. 
[01:01:00]  He looks more like a...  Reno is a nice guy.  What's his real goddamn name?  Because he kind of looks like an Arab.  What's his real name?  No.  Drew Boogie?  That's what he looks like.  He looks like a smiling Arab cab driver.  No, he doesn't.  He's just...  Frankenberry and Reno.  Oh, Frankenberry.  Of course.  Let's look at Frankenberry.  Frankenberry.  Yeah.  Why...  How do you get...  How do you... 
[01:01:30]  Looks like Bill Burr after a drunk driving conviction.  How do you get a name like Frankenberry, and how do you agree to keep it?  Hold on, Eric.  Who's that fatso?  Who's that?  That's Shrek?  Yeah.  Wait, are they using the actual Shrek logo for his name and his picture?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus H Christ.  Let's get him in trouble.  I...  I...  I'm sure they're very nice guys that do very nice promotional shows.  I'm quitting the business.  I can't go through this with Shrek and Frankenberry. 
[01:02:00]  You know when you should...  I just...  I...  I'm just Anthony.  Wait, I have an idea.  I'm just Anthony.  How about we all quit the business Monday when Jim's back from Po' Keevese.  Oh, Po' Keevese.  All gigs have been plugged.  On Friday's 30.  I'm doing it Friday, Saturday.  Wait, so you're going to call these guys live?  No, I'm only calling.  They wanted me to do it between ten and ten.  They're all pretty good.  Now you call Frankenberry.  They're all...  You call Frankenberry and then...  I'm deciding who you interview with, and I say Frankenberry and Reno. 
[01:02:30]  All right.  Frankenberry and then...  Oh, my God.  Frankenberry and Count Chocula.  You're going to ruin everything.  Yeah, we really do.  Self-destructive assholes.  You're the stupid one for even, like, handing this to us.  I didn't realize. 
[01:03:00]  What are you, nuts?  Frankenberry.  Wow.  Well, it is a memorable name.  Well, you've got to let one through.  There's quotas to fill, after all.  Frankenberry's talent, his secret talent, is listed as being a Pittsburgh pirate fan.  Yeah.  Is that a fucking...  Is that a talent?  Do you have anything else to say for yourself? 
[01:03:30]  Yes, Your Honor.  I'm a loyal Colts fan.  You're also a revolting, despicable scum of the earth who should be taken outside and squashed like a bug.  I object, Your Honor.  My client hasn't been found guilty yet.  You're absolutely right, Counselor.  It's 958.  By 959, he'll be guilty.  And Justice for All, anybody remember that?  A little bit, a little bit.  Dude, look at the color picture.  And I mean color picture.  He is some type...  He could even be Sicilian. 
[01:04:00]  Because you know the Moors.  Is Jimmy leaving the studio?  No.  I'm just fetching one of the coffee boys.  Waving to him.  Well, in all fairness, he...  I don't think...  I think he's...  He could be just part...  Look at his favorite band.  Stones, Zeppelin, Rush, Nirvana, Audioslave, Stop It, Movies, Godfather, Rocky, Goodfellas,  My Cousin Vinny, War Flicks, TV, Sopranos, CSI.  That's a house.  He enjoys house.  And that's...  And that's absolutely what you would put down as the answers if you were trying to fit 
[01:04:30]  into the white community.  No, if you're kind of...  I think you couldn't get more white than his answers.  Hey, where is that house promo?  All right.  Well, maybe Jimmy can ask you.  On an all-new house.  You want to hear the latest house promo?  God damn it.  We were supposed to break 20 minutes ago.  A teenager starts convulsing.  And house must decide what's wrong.  Oh, again?  No, listen to how bad this one is.  A girl lives with deadly allergies. 
[01:05:00]  Mommy builds her little angel with John Travolta's fault.  But she won't believe what's really killing her.  He's not here.  We already kidnapped her.  You want to add murder?  An all-new house coming up next on Fox.  Viewer discretion advised.  Of course.  Viewer discretion is very, very scary.  So she has allergies, and that's the problem.  Deadly allergies.  It's never just someone coming and going, hey, Dr. House, yeah, get a splinter.  It's a little infected.  Do you get the tweezers?  Never any.  Never house putting the old rubber glove on and shove it in and test your prostate. 
[01:05:30]  It's always like the makeup person must be purple under the eyes again this week.  What does the patient need?  Purple under the eyes, a little blue on the lips.  All right.  Can you shake in bed and cut?  Print it.  Perfect.  The show, it's the same thing.  I would love to talk to someone that does research for all those medical shows.  Because you know they're just going through medical books, just finding the most obscure,  fucked up disease that no one knows about. 
[01:06:00]  So they can throw it on TV and throw another thing that we have to worry about into our stupid skulls.  Another horrible illness that I don't know what it is.  Like, you know, something as stupid as, well, you know, all of a sudden my left eye is blinking a lot.  It must be just a little twitch.  No big deal.  Oh, no, according to ER, you've got two days to live.  Great.  You get the little twitch in your eye?  You ever get the little Morse code in the corner of your eye?  And you're like, this is great.  This will go away in two days or it's a brain tumor.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:06:30]  According to ER, it's a brain tumor.  Yeah.  I'll turn on grapefruit that I didn't notice my whole life.  Thank you.  I'll turn on house or ER.  I'll watch it.  It started as an eye twitch.  Right.  He went to house to check it out.  That's why I watch it.  One day later, we have to kill him to, bring him back to kill him to save him again on an all new house.  That's why I watch American Idol.  Right.  No disease there.  It's just fun.  Fun.  They're singing.  It's just cute fun.  Hey, Sean in New York.  What's up? 
[01:07:00]  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  The Reno and Frankenberry is the hometown station.  So is the wood man.  And they're saying you hit it right on the fucking head.  Waking up with wood and the bulge in the morning and all that shit.  Those guys are on like a top 40 hip hop bullshit station.  Why would you, wait, who's on a top 40 hip hop station?  The Bulger and Woodman.  Reno and Frankenberry are like, they were a classic rock, but now they play the new stuff too.  Wait a minute, buddy.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Now, now, Bulger and Woodman, it's a hip hop station. 
[01:07:30]  Are they black?  Is it like a rap station or is it just top 40?  Top 40, top 40 dance mix type of stuff.  Oh, okay, okay.  So it's not as bad because one of their bigger demos would be females.  Okay.  I'm like, if you're a rock jock and you've got promos going,  you're waking up with wood.  Woodman.  It's two for Tuesday.  Twice the wood for you.  Frankenberry's what?  Frankenberry's a drummer.  He played, he came up and did a...  No, sir. 
[01:08:00]  I see Reno is, I see Reno's secret talent as drummer.  Oh, is Reno the little bald guy?  I confused the two.  Yes, Reno.  Reno the...  And they got a hole with him.  Just a fucking pain in the ass.  Ooh, they got a hole.  Reno is six from Happy Days.  Her name's Corinne.  Nothing?  All right.  Why is Frankenberry...  This guy's Steve from Jersey?  Yeah.  He says Frankenberry is his real last name.  Dude, you believe that?  I don't know.  That's what they say. 
[01:08:30]  That is impossible.  All right, let's go to Steve.  Is that their hole?  Is that Frankenberry's hole?  Let me see.  All right, she's got a little skank to her.  Yeah.  That's not bad.  That's not bad.  Frankenberry's hole.  Frankenberry's hole.  All at the show.  She's a Cheerio.  Got a hole in her.  Let's go to Steve in Jersey.  Steve.  I just want to tell you, that's his real last name.  I went to college with him out in Pennsylvania.  You did not, and it is not.  There is no fucking way anyone's real name is Frankenberry. 
[01:09:00]  It is.  It's Steve Frankenberry.  Stop it.  You're a douche.  Stop it.  Let's go to Brendan.  Oh, look, Ted Blueberry's calling.  It looks like we freed up old Jimmy Norton's schedule.  You know, we didn't have a problem with anyone on that list.  Now we're going to.  Now we do.  We just started three more wars.  Great.  Brendan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hi.  Hey, old Jimmy. 
[01:09:30]  Hi, Angel.  Yeah, I'm from Poughkeepsie, and I've heard all those shows, too.  That guy, Sean, stole all my jokes, so I can't go anywhere with that.  You can car crash me.  What's one of your jokes that he stole?  They weren't really jokes, but all the whole stuff.  Here's a joke, if you have them, miss.  My fodder bore me righter than my mutter.  He shat me from his asshole.  Tee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  Okay.  You can hear that and more in Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie.  Here's a joke, if you like them, miss.  My fodder bore me righter than my mutter. 
[01:10:00]  He shat me from his asshole.  Tee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  Let's go to Eric in New York.  Eric.  Little Jimmy.  Guy.  How are you, sir?  We're going to see you Friday night.  Friday?  Friday in Poughkeepsie.  All right.  Hey, we got a...  Woodman is a big O&A fan.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah?  So, he's going to be one you guys are going to have fun with. 
[01:10:30]  The other guy, Bulger, he's a hole as well.  And, I don't know, I don't think you guys are going to get any fun with that show.  Jimmy's going to really have to tone down his stuff.  Oh, this cookie-cutting radio stuff.  It's got to stop.  No, you don't need a hole.  The only one I'm doing live is Reno and Frankenberry.  Reno and Frankenberry.  And Frankenberry.  I'm doing...  The other ones are all tape delay, which is...  I prefer tape delay because...  Why?  If I curse, they can beep it, do what they want.  It's a little bit more relaxed. 
[01:11:00]  Can we do it live on our show, please?  If they let me, of course.  I'd be happy to.  I'd love to.  Why not?  Because that won't be distracting and uncomfortable.  Who's the first one?  Reno and Frankenberry.  All right, let's call him.  What time?  Always have people on from Bananas Comedy Club.  It's in the 8 o'clock hour.  All right.  Call him right now.  Well, I was going to get...  We're in it.  All right.  I got to...  Now I just got to hear Reno and Frankenberry.  We got to tell Reno and Frankenberry that we're on the air live, though, right?  No, we don't.  All right.  We don't play by any rules. 
[01:11:30]  Fuck the rules.  Fuck you.  I won't do what you tell me.  Hey, it's their radio show that we're on.  They're not on our show, right?  Let's go to Jill.  Jill?  I think we better say...  Jill?  Jill?  Jill?  Hey, how are you, Jill?  Thanks for calling the program.  So, listen, on the house promo that you were just talking about...  Yeah.  ...the reason she had an allergy, he found a tick up her pussy.  Stop it.  No, I'm serious.  Her pussy and a nervous twitch. 
[01:12:00]  She actually had a tick up her vagina?  He had a tick up her vagina and he pulled it out while she was, like, dying in an elevator.  So, now, what would a tick do in a girl's vagina that would make her so close to death?  It sounds unpleasant, but...  What do you think, Ann?  If it's a big tick, it could cause some problems.  Some problems?  Was it a black tick?  It looks like the house doctor knows what he's doing with ticks.  All right, punch it out, guys. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  Well...  All right.  All right.  I'm glad you...  ...punch it out because we would have went 20 more minutes on a really dumb joke.  Yeah, tick jokes.  Oh, God.  Voss, what's up?  As time ticks away for house, there's a tick up a pussy.  Voss?  Tick tock?  No worse than the real promo.  Vossy Voss.  Voss.  What's happening?  We just heard your fine interview on WMMR.  Did you hear the good story I did about Patricia and Billy? 
[01:13:00]  No.  Are you for real?  No, we heard you chasing the girl through the woods with the ball peen hammer.  No, I did 10 minutes on how my daughter is in high school and she goes out with a guy named Willie Burr, who no one likes him.  And there's a big black guy named Patrice that likes my daughter.  I did 10 minutes on them and it just was...  I can't believe you guys.  You're listening to the dumb stuff and then when I do the good stuff, I plug the black bag.  It was funny.  The rape stuff was very funny. 
[01:13:30]  Chasing her through the woods.  We were enjoying you.  We were laughing.  We just missed that part.  You're much better on commercial than I am, dude.  I'm horrendous.  Maybe if you answered your phone, you could have told us that you were doing comedy earlier.  Oh, no.  The second part of the interview.  The main guys in Cleveland won't let me in because for the last time, I did a bunch of O&A references.  What guys?  What guys?  What guys?  Malone or...  No.  Not Rover.  They're two guys.  Oh, that show. 
[01:14:00]  Yep.  I know that show.  The two guys.  Actually, I know that show.  And they won't let me in because last time I was in the studio, I brought up O&A and they  said something.  I go, hey, guys, when I'm in O&A, I'll bring you guys up.  Right?  And so I couldn't get in there.  For some reason, everywhere I go, you guys burn my bridges.  Good.  Now you know how the fucking comedians feel with you.  Everywhere we go, we have to explain away our friendship with you.  You fucking creep. 
[01:14:30]  Everywhere Vos goes, there's a problem.  And you got to be like, well, no, no, he's actually a good guy.  It's like being an alcoholic, fucking the wife of an alcoholic.  Well, no, no, he's okay.  You got to get to know him.  My parents met every comedian and liked every comedian.  You know what, Jew?  Except for you.  You're the only one they had a problem with.  Now they love him.  But when they first met, they're like, we don't like him.  Yeah.  But if you get tape of the second part of that interview, I mentioned you guys a couple times.  Whackbag.  Yeah, we'll work on getting that tape. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, tape immediately.  It was really funny.  And when you're in Poughkeepsie, there was one decent radio show that I did in Poughkeepsie.  I don't remember who they were, but they had a gay guy in the studio, a black gay guy, some old guy.  And they're just all, you just trash them all.  I don't know.  Listen.  You'd make a great witness.  You'd make a great witness.  What comedy club are you at?  Ready?  Next.  Where did it happen?  There was a street, a light, and a building. 
[01:15:30]  Jesus Christ, boss.  How about some detail to anything?  Hey, guys, let me back in.  Two minutes.  No, no.  Jimmy, you are not leaving.  I want to hear this interview with Frankenberry and Reno and Frankenberry.  That's right.  Reno and Frankenberry.  I must hear you talk to Reno and Frankenberry.  Count Jocula isn't in?  What?  Count Jocula isn't in?  Yeah, we did that already, boss. 
[01:16:00]  What, did you think we had missed that one?  How do you miss the Count Jocula?  The guy's last name was Frankenberry.  Oh, that's right.  It is a cereal.  You really make me sick.  You know what?  You know what?  Fuck you guys.  I've got to go.  Fucking get an accent over you, jackass.  What gig are you at tonight, D.I.?  Yeah, boss, give us the rundown of the gig tonight.  Cleveland Improv.  Damn it.  He got it in.  He actually got it in.  The son of a bitch.  He got it in.  Cleveland Improv tonight.  All weekend with Voss and Bonnie.  Finger exercises.  Fuck it, he was hilarious on that show. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  He was in studio.  It's a little easier when you're in studio, but man, I hate doing phoners.  Even here, I'm not comfortable doing them.  Oh, you better be comfortable because we're watching.  I mean when I call you guys.  Oh, isn't that odd?  Like, I call every so often on my drive home.  If a cool subject comes up that I could add to, I call up Ron and Fez when I'm listening  to their show.  And as it's ringing, I'm getting all butterflies in my stomach.  And then the answer is like, hey, you're on the air.  And I'm humming a humming a humming a humming a humming a humming a humming. 
[01:17:00]  All of a sudden, I'm a nervous fucking caller.  I do a goddamn show.  Yes, you do.  Why do I get nervous?  When are you calling the boys?  I guess I can't do it for me.  They say we don't have the technology hooked up.  Oh, stop it.  That's what Derek said.  Make it work.  Make it work right now.  Do it on your cell phone.  Let's say hi to Tammy.  In Texas, Tammy.  Texas, Tammy.  Hi.  Hey, I just wanted to say, on one of the episodes, you were talking about how it's never just  a regular, you know, problem or whatever.  On house, yes.  They do a lot of, like, clinic episodes.  Like, they had one guy that wanted to get Deprovera because, I guess, apparently, his 
[01:17:30]  dad got a hot stepmom or whatnot, but he was just making up a bullshit thing that he  didn't want to fuck cows anymore.  Just sideline stuff for some horrific disease.  Yeah.  For some convulsing patient with dark rings under their eyes and blood coming out of every  hole in their body.  But then another thing, too.  Like, I'm surprised that Anthony doesn't watch it with as much Vicodin as he pops throughout  the whole fucking episode.  I don't pop Vicodin. 
[01:18:00]  Let me tell you something.  I'll clear this up right now because these things have a way of running.  When I had a toothache, I took Vicodin.  Yeah, it all starts off with the toothache.  For four days, for four days, I took Vicodin.  I still have the Vicodin from that toothache.  Still have it.  Just in case.  I still have it.  I haven't taken them.  A guy at your brother's restaurant handed me two Vicodin. 
[01:18:30]  Hey, dude, dude, here you go.  I open my hand.  There's Vicodin.  I throw him out.  What do you think?  I want to get hooked on Vicodin?  Thank you.  All right.  You clear that up.  We all believe him, too.  I have to call these people because I have to.  Call.  Call.  Go ahead.  We're actually working on right now.  Okay.  What are we doing in there, Ben?  Didn't we say we wanted the ability to dial out?  I believe you did.  Of course we did.  In this studio. 
[01:19:00]  Of course we did.  And we were given that very ability.  What?  They're not answering.  What do you mean they're not answering?  They're not answering their hotline.  How are they not answering their hotline?  We can do it.  As long as, you know.  Jimmy, do you have a special number?  No, we have it.  But is it a different number than our Jimmy has?  No, I gave it to him.  Oh.  Still ringing?  Still ringing?  Still ringing.  How could they let their hotline ring?  That's a good phone screener for you.  Cannot call from 835 to 840 because they do sports.  I like to call either 810, 820. 
[01:19:30]  It's 820.  Okay.  Keep calling.  Or 850.  Because that's when they start their segments.  What?  What's your time, man?  What's up, y'all?  I must hear you interview.  Y'all, man.  With Reno and Frankenberry.  I'm coming up to Poe Kiffsey.  What's up, y'all?  Friday.  Saturday.  Yo, Friday, Saturday.  Are they answering?  They're not answering the hotline. 
[01:20:00]  They're all waiting in the other room.  How could you not answer the hotline?  They're all just staring at the phone as it rings.  Can you read dial?  Maybe y'all dialing the wrong number.  You keep dialing until someone picks up.  Yeah.  Let it ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Keep dialing.  Be dialing.  Yeah.  Maybe this will help answer their phone.  Maybe this will help.  I have a feeling it won't.  Got to draw some attention to this.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone. 
[01:20:30]  I got a fee.  Oh, I hate when it ends.  I was singing.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  I've got this feeling so appealing for us to get together and sing.  Sing.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  This won't stick in your head, by the way, all day.  Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  It grows in bunches. 
[01:21:00]  I've got my hunches.  It's the best.  Beats the rest.  Cellular, modular, interactivodular.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Ping, pong, ping, pong, ping, pong, ping.  Banana phone.  It's no baloney.  It ain't a phony.  My cellular, bananular phone.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I asked you. 
[01:21:30]  I like banana phone.  Banana phone.  Banana phone.  Oh, we're just kind of sitting here right now.  Just waiting.  Come on.  All through that?  They didn't pick up?  What, Ben?  I heard.  And they wonder.  They wonder why they're in Poughkeepsie doing radio.  They don't know how to answer the hotline.  The hotline's been ringing.  They said they're in break, so we called the guy's cell phone.  Do you think maybe they kind of, like, know?  Of course they know.  Well, I'll tell them.  I'll tell them more on the air.  Of course. 
[01:22:00]  Okay, now we're calling back.  What?  They found someone to answer the hotline.  Oh, good.  Okay.  All right, now we're on it.  This is great.  He's like, Norton's calling?  And they also didn't know Jim was scheduled to call in today.  Oh, good.  So, we're calling now they're going to have someone answer the hotline.  Someone's at their post there, so.  Okay.  All right.  One second.  Well, keep that mic on, because I want to hear Travis do his thing.  Come on now, Travis.  All right, we got Travis who does the phone screen in the other room.  This is very, uh...  With his Kelly from Time Life headset on.  Let me see. 
[01:22:30]  I know, isn't it?  Hi, I'm Travis from Time Life.  Yeah.  Taking donations at the Gay Men's Health Price and Hotline.  Faggot.  Just wants to do some volunteer work.  Just wants to do some volunteer work.  Yeah, exactly.  Just wants to do some good in the world, don't you, sissy?  You and your merry headphones.  Is it still ringing?  Yeah.  What?  They said they were answering the hotline.  They said they were going to pick it up.  We talked to the DJ on his cell phone.  We didn't know Jim was calling in. 
[01:23:00]  The DJ said he was going to get somebody to answer the hotline, yet it still rings.  Hi, this is, uh, I'm calling with Jim Norton.  Oh.  Hi, I'm calling from XM.  Uh, we're wondering if we can simulcast the interview at the same time.  We have him on our show right now.  That's really smart.  That's good.  All right, hang on one second.  Oh.  Shh, shh, shh.  All right, we might get this done.  Shh, shh, shh, shh.  Don't ruin it.  Hello?  Hello.  Hi, are you guys on the, uh, are we on the radio, or are we in a break?  Hi, you're on the radio.  What's going on?  Well, actually, we're in a break.  Right, we're recording right now. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, we're not doing it live?  Well, what's going on?  Oh, nothing.  I'm doing, uh, bananas this Friday, Saturday.  You are, huh?  Yeah, they said the United States is calling in.  Okay, now listen, we have, hold on here.  The reason why I'm recording is because we have, hold on, let me take a look here.  Uh, one, two, three, we have a whole bunch, we have a while yet before we can go live with you.  That's why we don't want to waste your time.  You don't want to make sure we get you on, and we get all the information out, uh, you  know, but unfortunately, I mean, we definitely don't want you waiting and on hold for too 
[01:24:00]  long.  Oh, what, what, what time would you guys go live?  Because I wanted to talk to, uh, Reno and Frankenberry.  Okay, we have, uh, let's take a look here.  We've got, uh, I'll tell you exactly.  One, two, three, four, uh, five, and then we can go right to five minutes.  Okay, well, do you want us to call back?  We can do that.  I'll call back.  I mean, that's fine.  How about a number we can call you back out a minute before the break?  All right, well, get off the air.  Give the, give the number for, uh.  Yeah, this is off the air right now. 
[01:24:30]  Give me your number.  No, no, no.  All right, hold on.  All right.  Gary, uh, Travis, give us home.  Gary, give us home.  Dirty got him.  You got him?  Give him the number.  What's the number?  You guys got the number?  Uh, eight, six, seven.  Call Travis.  Get the number.  Wait, wait, wait.  Eight, six, seven.

And, of course, we have an intern challenge, all that, on the way.  But right now, our special guest comedian, and he's going to be at Bananas Comedy Club. 
[01:29:30]  You've seen him on HBO.  You've seen him everywhere.  Bananas Comedy Club this weekend on Friday and Saturday night.  Jim Norton, how the hell are you, my friend?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Good.  Where are you right now?  Right now, I'm in New York on 57th Street.  When are you going to come up and have some booze with us?  Are you going to go drinking on Friday night when you go after your little gig here, Bananas?  I can't drink.  I used to drink a little bit.  And then, like, you know how it is when you're a teenager and you drink, and you're out with your friends,  and the next thing you know, you're in the hospital getting stitches in your wrist? 
[01:30:00]  Yes.  Yeah, so that was kind of why I stopped drinking when I was 18.  So how are things going?  Things all right?  Yeah, things are really good.  They said you guys didn't know I was calling in this morning.  Oh, well, you know what?  We found out at the last minute.  But I'm glad you did call.  Is this Reno or Frankenberry?  Reno, and that's Frankenberry.  I'm not Frankenberry.  That's Reno, yes.  Oh, okay, cool.  So where are you from, Reno?  We're trying to figure out.  Are you Italian?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm originally from Brooklyn.  Grew up in Jersey.  But you probably know me when I used to be on the air at Z100 in New York. 
[01:30:30]  Then I went out to BLI in Long Island.  It's probably we've run into each other a couple times.  But, yeah, that's probably how you do me.  Oh, okay, cool.  So are you guys going to come to the show?  I know it's kind of a big thing here.  You guys have the intern thing, and you're giving away bad medicine tickets.  Yeah, all that crap.  You have all kinds of stuff going on.  I take some bad medicine.  It's called AZT.  LOL.  It happened.  My Lord.  So what's going on this morning, guys?  I know you kind of, it's a little awkward here.  What's going on this morning for you? 
[01:31:00]  Well, you know, we've got a lot of crap going on.  Of course, you know, we have this Yankees biggest fan.  You guys are Yankees or Mets?  I prefer the Yankees and prefers the Mets, and my friend Greg prefers the Mets.  Yeah, I have Frankenberry over here who's an ass pirate fan.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah, he likes the Pirates.  I've got two favorite teams, the Pirates and the Yanks.  Are you from Pittsburgh?  Not a Yankee fan, are you?  No, I'm not a Yankee fan. 
[01:31:30]  I am not.  And I'm not from Pittsburgh, but I lived there for a long time.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So this weekend, by the way, we, you know, we always...  Boring.  Love these guys.  Listen, you guys, you're coming up on Friday, and you're coming to Bananas.  I thought you guys were going to come live on Friday.  You're going to come to the studio Friday?  I would love to come into the studio tomorrow, but they didn't tell me.  They told me just to do a phoner, and then I could only do it at certain times because  you guys had to do sports.  I really am not good on the phone, but I would like to come in studio, but they said you guys  were booked.  You want to come in tomorrow? 
[01:32:00]  Is that possible?  Is that possible, Frankenberry?  I think we can figure something out.  I'm looking at Opie.  Is that possible?  No.  No, I'd probably have to be here.  Hey, is there a big delay on this?  Do we have a big delay here?  Do we have...  Yeah, we're on like an 18-second delay or something like that.  Okay.  Have you guys been watching America's Funniest Moms?  Have we been watching it?  It's like, yeah, it's like some contest for the funniest mom.  No, I haven't caught that one yet.  Oh, okay, cool.  They got like the finalists now.  It's a big contest, and Susan Smith so far is in the lead.  No. 
[01:32:30]  No?  Cricket?  Cricket?  What are you guys talking about?  What's your topic today?  We were just talking about Rich Voss.  Boring radio jocks.  Yeah, we were doing...  You called the right place.  Rich Voss, yeah.  He was on our show a while back.  The guy's great.  A lot of fun.  I'm sorry, this is...  I just, I'm really nervous.  I'm afraid I'm going to curse, and I'm...  Have you ever been like on a date, and your two friends are in the backseat, and you're  trying to just keep your rod and keep going, but they're like whispering she's fat in your 
[01:33:00]  ear?  Yeah.  That's kind of what it feels like.  The closest date this is like is when Travolta took that chick onto the Verrazano.  You guys just want to jump right off, right?  Double J.  Yes, exactly.  I actually, I have a couple of good acts coming up with me.  I'm working with Marina Franklin and Doug Out Doug, who's a guy from Canada who does a  lot of gigs.  And we were being simulcast on Pal Talk, which is our camera hookup here.  So you actually have a lot of people in the U.S. and Canada hearing this whole thing. 
[01:33:30]  Nice.  Nice.  So what are you guys talking about today?  Yeah, what are you guys talking about?  That's what I want to know.  What are we talking about?  Well, actually, we've been incredibly boring this morning.  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, now, don't take that seriously.  What's that?  Don't take that all seriously, Frankenberry.  We're talking about gas.  Is your real last name Frankenberry?  Look, dude, I am painfully single.  The last thing I'm going to do is make up a radio name that's a gay pink serial character.  How did you, like, why would you not change it then? 
[01:34:00]  What do you mean?  Why would I?  It's my name.  It's my family name.  But why would you not change it?  You know, change it to the radio like John Smith or something.  That cannot be your real name.  I'm sure Hitler is still somebody's family name.  They'd probably change it.  Just don't write it down on job applications.  Well, look at it this way.  I mean, do you, Smith versus Frankenberry, which one are you going to remember?  That's true.  I mean, probably Smith.  Yeah, yeah.  Listen, the anonymous names are so much easier to remember, so I decided I'm going to stick  with Frankenberry or something, and it's going to drop right out of their heads. 
[01:34:30]  How awful was high school?  Actually, what was worse was grade school, because the serial came out when I was seven.  Oh, really?  Sorry, I guess you had it before the serial came out.  Oh, really?  He didn't have it?  He got it.  He got it.  It's going to take it right down, all right? 
[01:35:00]  Oh, man.  Um, hey, we got a bunch of guys that want to talk to you on hold, all right?  Definitely, man.  Thank you.  There's some guys on hold.  You know what the worst part is?  Those guys are being cool.  I had, I just knew. 
[01:35:30]  Hello?  BDH.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes.  Hey, you want to do, go ahead.  What do you want to ask them?  Yeah, hey, uh, I wanted to ask, uh, Jim Norton about his TV show.  Uh, what would you like to know, mister?  Uh, yeah, Jimmy, I understand your new TV show is called, uh, Lucky Happy Typing Girl.  Uh, and when is that going to be on the air, sir?  Well, Lucky Happy Typing Girl is an HBO show.  It actually comes out after Entourage, uh, June 11th.  Uh, it stars Louis C.K., and, uh, I, I'm in the show, and, uh, General Bam, a guy, is, 
[01:36:00]  is also in the show, and it comes out June 11th after Entourage and before Dane Cook's show.  Any truth that, uh, Frederica Bimmer will be in that also as a guest star?  No, Frederica, uh, supposedly, we're trying to get for season two, but, uh, for season one, she was not available.  She was somewhere, uh, she was doing something in the water.  Very nice.  Thank you, Reno and, and Frankenberry from fullblownage.com.  Thank you, guys.  Welcome.  Who's helping?  Do we have other callers? 
[01:36:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Hey, what do you want to ask them?  Jimmy, how you doing this morning?  I'm really good.  I didn't know, it's just Steve up in Kingston.  I didn't know you were coming up to, uh, Poughkeepsie.  Yes.  Um, Ramones, get these faggots off the radio.  Wow, that was, uh, thanks.  What are you, PDA?  Hello?  What's up, Jim Norton?  What's up, man?  Yeah, which way is north, man?  Well, sir, um, good, thanks for the phone call. 
[01:37:00]  Let's, let's see who's next.  This is what it's like, huh, to be on the other end of this.  Yeah, it's great, man.  I don't care.  You know what, people like to listen to this show because it's, it's stupid.  I don't know.  But, uh, hey, listen, good luck with you.  We'll talk to you.  I will.  Hold on.  Here, here.  Hold on.  Hey, you little thing.  You make me want to film it.  I do appreciate you guys having me on, and I know it was, it was like, someone hit the button there. 
[01:37:30]  Hey, that's all right, man.  We don't care.  Like I said, as long as your car wreck is a nicer car, you go, boys.  You guys are very cool.  Thank you for having me on, and sorry that I didn't, uh, hold on.  It's, um, I feel like I didn't bring much to the table, so I'll. 
[01:38:00]  You're fine.  You're absolutely fine.  Taking down cops.  This actually, this actually went better than expected.  You are.  Hi, man.  How are we going, bro?  Guys, thank you.  Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  All right.  Thank you. 
[01:38:30]  Thank you, guys.  Hello?  Oh, thank you.  Hello?  Well.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  I just feel bad.  I had, they, no, no, they were actually okay with it.  I just, I had, I had nothing funny to say.  I was actually glad you jumped in.  Oh, God damn.  They were nice guys, too. 
[01:39:00]  God, I'm like.  Well.  Nice.  Take that off the list of, uh, radio stations you can call.  Yeah, we'll scratch that one.  Oh, yeah.  Share that.  I don't know.  Well, maybe they were, uh, they'll be, uh, maybe they're new.  It was funny being on the other end of the phone calls.  Yeah.  He's like, I felt assaulted, even though they were all.  First one, I guess.  Doug out, Doug.  Well, let's, uh, let's say hi to Frankie in New York. 
[01:39:30]  Frankie.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, Frankie.  Guys, they, uh, right now they're still playing music on PDH.  Uh, they're probably, uh, they taped that part with, with the phone calls.  Yeah.  But that was painful, man.  Thanks.  Absolutely painful.  They put everything out, Doug.  Okay.  All right.  Very good.  They clipped Jimmy Ness and his rod in the front seat.  That, that got over the air.  Oh, yeah?  Okay.  All right.  Right on.  Bye, fellas.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:40:00]  So, what are you guys talking about today?  Wow.  Oh, why?  Boring job.  Oh.  Oh.  I was just worried you were going to play other clips that actually went better than I expected.  Yeah.  They were much cooler with it than I thought.  Thank God you jumped in.  I was happy you jumped in and started asking legit questions.  Legit?  Oh.  I was just stretching.  It's frankly, I just had nothing.  And I can't do, like, I felt bad doing jokes because I'm in this studio, so you feel like  a phony doing jokes. 
[01:40:30]  I can't do jokes looking at you two guys.  That's why this is great.  It's, it's so fun to see you're just uncomfortable.  Oh.  Trying to make it work for everybody.  I know.  Just, yeah.  Like the fucking middle child.  Just trying to impress everybody.  Just making everybody happy.  Instead, I made no one happy.  Make sure no one fights.  Yeah.  No, yeah, no.  Meant to say.  Right.  And that's not what he meant to say.  He meant to say boring and he said boring.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm trying to, like, legitimately laugh and cover that.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:41:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That was fun.  That was truly repugnant.  All right.  Nothing wrong with that.  Nothing wrong with that interview, Jimmy.  Yeah.  All right.  What's the next one?  Did you get your info out?  Yeah.  What's the next one?  They're all, honestly, God, the next ones are all taped.  They wanted me, one I have to call between six and seven tonight, which we played tomorrow  morning.  One, I have to play the Woodman.  They wanted me to call between 10 and 11.  I told them no because I'm on the air. 
[01:41:30]  And the Mark Bolger show, they wanted me to call today between 10, 10, 30.  And I said no because I'm on the air.  So call them while we're on the air.  Okay, I will.  But, I mean, I just didn't, they're not told between 10, 10, 30.  Dude, call one of these shows and just make believe you have something horrifically wrong  with your voice and don't acknowledge it.  Just, like, hold your lip down. 
[01:42:00]  Dude.  All right.  All right.  Let's try, um.  Let's try.  All right.  Well, the Shrek one, I don't call until 6 or 7 p.m., so that's off the list.  All right.  Okay.  Let's try, uh.  Hold on.  Can Banner someone come in here?  I'll give you the number to call.  Mm-hmm.  God damn.  That was fun. 
[01:42:30]  Just take this one.  Why did you have the PalTalk camera on your head?  I didn't get that.  Oh, oh, I, uh, wanted the audience on PalTalk to be able to listen to the call that was going through, uh, on their end.  Uh-huh.  So I put the microphone.  Aren't they listening to the show?  By my ear.  I don't, I, I wasn't sure if they were able to hear the actual phone call part of it.  I hope they were.  I don't know.  It's just odd.  Ben, were both calls going out over the air?  Like, I, I, I, I, which calls? 
[01:43:00]  It was going out over the air, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  All it was.  Okay.  But, but it doesn't matter because PalTalk, Opie, PalTalk, can only hear what's said in this room.  So they can't hear anything that's coming through our headphones.  Oh, unless they're listening to the radio.  Oh, there's a delay, too.  For the people that are listening to X-Time illegally, you're helping them out.  So for the people that were listening, uh, just on PalTalk, I, I threw them that little extra ball.  So much for making a living out of this, uh, he's trying to turn a profit, really. 
[01:43:30]  They just wanted to hear that part of the call.  I don't do it for every caller.  I just fuck it with you.  Jesus.  Ah, that's good.  Oh, we got it.  Should Anthony put the mic on everything?  That'll be the next post.  Yeah.  I'm sick of hearing about PalTalk.  You know, they talk about Anthony's Viking inhabit way too much.  We all know he's addicted to Viking bin. 
[01:44:00]  Exclamation point.  Exclamation point.  Exclamation point.  And by the way, do you know how happy I was to talk about my TV show until fucking I heard stupid lucky and happy typing girl?  I'm like, God damn it.  I was all psyched.  Someone had like up there knows I have a show coming out.  It's like the word is spreading like wildfire.  It's spreading like wildfire.  Yeah.  Um, got an announcement to make.  We have officially, uh, done our longest break since coming to satellite radio.  An hour and 45 minutes. 
[01:44:30]  Wow.  Really?  Look at that.  Wow.  Look at that.  That's a long one.  We're going to take a break, I guess.  I love you.  Hey, we got the metal guy calling in at what time?  Nine.  Nine o'clock.  We got the metal guy calling in that did the documentary on, uh, metal.  A headbanger's journey.  I watched part of the movie last night and I enjoyed what I saw so far.  I want to give the guy props.  Throw away my bios on Reno and Frankenberry.  I gotta say they were much cooler than most people would have been.  They were fine and dandy. 
[01:45:00]  They were cool.  Okay.  Jimmy, don't worry.  Don't worry.  You didn't burn that Poughkeepsie bridge.  To be honest with you, I don't really care about the bridge.  I mean, this show will draw for me more than any show I ever do.  Oh.  Uh, but you know, I feel bad smashing it.  More than you realize, Jimmy.  More than you realize.  Oh, I know.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Wait a minute.  Oh, well.  But I realize a lot.  Hey.  Hey.  There's more for the listeners so they can start speculating again.  But I thought it was real.  We're going to go for 72 pages this time. 
[01:45:30]  I have a half a rod right now.  Ooh.  I'm pushing it against the desk.  Work on it.  What?  Want to see it?  No.  All right.  You're lost.  I never want to see it.  What are you, busy?  Oh, get away.  Ass out yesterday.  Let's say hi to Jerry.  Jerry?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  Jerry?  Wait, is that camera focused on my rod like it should be?  Fried and Joy is a milk container in the way.  I thought those guys were pretty cool, actually.  You guys, I think, can get back on there tomorrow.  They're not afraid of nobody. 
[01:46:00]  No, they were.  No, that was fine.  They were actually nice.  They were fine.  Jerry, we weren't.  Jerry, we were.  That was called being silly.  Yeah.  Don't confuse the two.  We weren't trying to be vicious.  We weren't trying to destroy them.  We were being silly.  I was one button away from hitting the Tom Sizemore clip, my friend, which would have ended  the conversation.  When I heard there was an 18-second delay, I said, oh, these guys are going to go hard  because they'll be able to help out of it anyway.  No, because then no one's going to want to play with us. 
[01:46:30]  You've got to know when to be silly, and you've got to know when to attack and just destroy.  All right, boys.  I'll see you in an up at Gypsy, Jimmy.  Later.  All right, Phil.  They're not enemies.  No, they're fine.  No, they seem cool.  And we got our lofts in.  Yeah.  There were a few lofts.  All right, we'll break for the next probably 25 minutes to catch up.  Oh, a terrestrial break.  I'm going to take a piss.  No, we'll try to come back as soon as possible.  Stay there.  Who doesn't love a nice dip in the tranquil blue ocean? 
[01:47:00]  Oh, that looks like a dorsal fin.  Carcharid and carcarious, if I'm not mistaken.  One moment.  Ramon, open your veins.  Thursday, it's the O.P. and Anthony Show, and you are listening now.  Hey, you.  What?  I like that, though. 
[01:47:30]  Right after.  You got the info out.  See, I'm very predictable.  I like that.  I don't let the music play for long.  People don't want to hear the music.  I think I waited too long.  Yeah, let's try another one.  One, one.  Derek, if you will.  Make believe.  Blah, blah, commercial.  Blah, blah.  Commercial.  Blah, blah, blah.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show, and you are listening.  Tune it up.  Here it comes.  Crank it.  But you got to, like, sell something. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  What do you mean?  Well, like our virus thing.  It's the O.N.A. virus.  It's spreading across America.  Oh, that's good.  Or it's Thursday, so it's almost Friday.  That's right.  Or yesterday was whipping out Wednesday.  Or, you know, use that opportunity to sell something about the show.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Commercial, commercial.  Call now.  Commercials are done, and here we are live again with the O.P. and Anthony program.  Like a virus, we spread all over the place. 
[01:48:30]  Such a Ralph Cramden delivery.  Hello out there in TV land.  Very nice.  Let's say hi to Doug.  What's up, gentlemen?  That was you that called, right?  What's up, Doug?  Indeed it was.  That was the first call.  Yeah.  God, I love red rum.  Yeah.  I thought I recognized the voice, but I was all happy somebody knew my show was coming out. 
[01:49:00]  Of course.  Yeah.  Lucky, happy typing, though.  Hey.  Yeah, you know what I forgot to plug on that was Pest Radio 101.  We had a format change last night that I wanted to make you guys aware of.  Pest Radio 101.  Format change.  What's going on?  They must fucking hate us at that company right now.  They took Pharrell's show from basically being what it was on Terrestrial Radio.  Last night, they even had a little, what Jimmy was just cutting, a little coming back from  break snippets, the promos there.  He is now the Howard 100 wrap-up show with Scott Pharrell. 
[01:49:30]  What he does now is he plays audio from Howard's show, Bubba's show, and Howard 100 News, and  does a end-of-the-night wrap-up.  He avoids taking phone calls.  He takes all the questions.  I wonder why.  Oh, wait a minute.  I thought you meant he did an extra show.  You mean he's still doing his show, but now it's a wrap-up show?  Yeah, his show has probably about 30 to 40% of what he used to do, so he still does a 
[01:50:00]  little bit of the sports, and I'm the man when you're the man, that bullshit he does with  That's shaking up.  But yeah, now he does a complete wrap-up show because he is so terrified to take phone calls  at this point.  He took a total of, I think it was 11 calls yesterday.  Wow.  That's down from like 100 and something, because we were racking up 80 calls a night.  Dude, you guys are fucking murdering him. 
[01:50:30]  They're ruthless, and they don't stop.  And he's so dishonest, he won't admit that it's affecting him.  He won't admit it.  All he does is like just cornball fucking radio.  Come on down, little man.  We'll dance.  Yeah.  Will we?  Will we dance?  Wait, I think I got that call.  Wow.  Oh, I don't want to tango with you, radio fella.  Shut your face and take a call.  It is two hours.  Hold on, hold on, Doug.  I got the call that Jimmy's referring to.  Bill in Texas, you're on with Pharrell and Howard 101.  Pharrell, your website sucks your mom in the box. 
[01:51:00]  What's up with that?  With my left?  With a what?  With a, oh, my website.  It does blow.  It's awful, man.  It's pathetic.  What's great about it is I keep old shows I do on there.  I'm like, listen live, 10 a.m.  I'm not even on at 10.  What's better?  You should go see little Jimmy this weekend.  Yeah, I'd love to go see him, and I'd beat his little pathetic pussy ass in.  I would dance with him in five minutes with one arm tied behind my fucking back.  I wouldn't tell you to kiss my ass, too, but you probably can't find it, you blind motherfucker.  Dude, there's no little four-foot motherfucker taking me on.  I'm 6'3", 2'10", let's dance. 
[01:51:30]  Welcome to hell.  You remember the hockey fights tonight?  Come on down.  You know where I'm at.  I've invited you a bunch of times.  You pussies never show up.  You know, welcome to hell.  You know, wait, who do you want to fight?  Jimmy.  And then us.  Oh.  Yeah, because I'm only four foot.  Jimmy.  I'm sure.  Don't punch Jimmy.  Don't hit me.  Leave him alone.  I don't want to dance with you.  No dancing.  No dancing.  What is with the radio lingo?  Come on down, let's dance a little thing.  Just fucking talk regular. 
[01:52:00]  Everyone's fighting.  Everyone's dancing.  We explain the fight thing.  Dance.  There's at least five, six guys over at the Little Doggy Company that would love to punch  us in the face or mostly me.  Well, and I explained this already, Scott, Mr. Farrell, if I will.  What are we supposed to do?  You're on like the 58th floor when you're making your threats.  You're like, come on down.  So what are we supposed to do?  Every building has security now. 
[01:52:30]  We walk up.  We did this whole bit.  Excuse me.  What are you here for?  Hi.  I'm here to dance.  I'm here to dance with Scott Farrell.  All right.  Yeah.  We're going to beat each other up.  And he told me to come down to the station.  So here I am to dance.  And then he has to get on the phone.  Yeah.  No.  Mr. Hughes is here.  He says to dance.  Right.  Yes.  Farrell.  Scott Farrell.  Right.  No.  I'm sorry.  We have no information.  Can I have your ID, please? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, sure.  Here's my ID.  And then they give me a little stick on.  They'll give you a stick on.  My real name and purpose for visit to dance with Scott Farrell.  To dance.  And then they'll go.  Now go around the corner and go to the 58th floor.  Right.  You get in the elevator.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  And I just think stupid stuff.  Like, wow, this elevator's a little slow.  And a lot of people are getting on in between floors.  Now you're like, it's going to take forever to get up there.  And someone recognizes you.  Hey, Opie, what are you doing?  I'm here to dance with Farrell. 
[01:53:30]  I'm here to dance with Scott Farrell.  But if it was me, I'd have to bring a rope so he could make sure he ties the one arm behind  his back like he promised.  Right.  There is going to be a rope.  How did the producer tie it?  Because you're like, no, I can't tie it because I'm a man.  You're a man.  How can I be a man when you're a man?  I can't tie it.  You can't tie it.  I can't tie it.  Yeah, you've got to bring your own rope and you want to be a nice guy so you make sure  it's a soft rope so it doesn't hurt too much when you have to tie his arm behind his back.  Velvet straps.  These guys are a bunch of idiots.  Bubba the Love Sponge threatened me to a fight.  I said, all right, well, you said we have no fans.  I'm going to be at the Hard Rock Cafe, St. Paddy's Day. 
[01:54:00]  There you go.  There's your opportunity.  I'm a parent.  I have things to do.  I can't make it on the...  There's an opportunity to punch me in the face.  You said name the time, name the place.  You said name the time.  There was a time and place name.  Name the place.  And nothing happened.  I have a baby.  Yeah, well, then turn it over on its face in the crib and head out the door.  Shit, dick.  Yeah, you want to dance?  Then he goes, yeah, I need more time than that to get a babysitter.  It's like, all right, well, then I guess the name the time and name the place thing,  you didn't really mean it now, did you?  How about the Woodward girl? 
[01:54:30]  Let's hire her.  Hey, shake it up.  You bet she will.  Shake it up.  Wah!  Fucking yuck.  Can you just imagine if you could, though, because you guys should probably imagine better  than any of us fans could.  Imagine if you could being eight days into a two-year contract, and now you're forced  to be the suck, everybody else's cock on that station show.  That's it.  Because of a band of misfits that won't leave you alone. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  And when are we going to make Howard's life a living hell, Doug?  Not too impressed with the effort so far.  Howard's a little tough because he doesn't take a lot of real calls.  Yeah, everything is so screened and so filtered.  He's got so many buffers here.  That makes for great real radio, by the way.  Between him and the pest, so.  He's got Pharrell taking the stage calls.  Last night there was a two-hour buffer where he did nothing but take stage calls. 
[01:55:30]  But you knew his screener was telling him what was going on.  Because all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he just started going off on you guys.  Yeah, when that happens, it means that the pests have gotten to him, even though they're  not on the air.  Oh, no.  Is he bad-mouthing the radio show?  See, here's...  He's tall.  I don't want to dance with him.  No dance.  And here's the difference.  If they took the phones out of our game, we'd still have a fine radio show.  They've done that in the past.  That's the beauty of what these guys are doing.  Mechanically.  Pharrell's show is based on lots and lots of dumb phone calls. 
[01:56:00]  XM's taking the phones out of our show, Opie, remember?  He's got some stooge in the studio.  He's reading off of a message board.  He's terrified to go to the phones.  It is fucking hilarious.  He's reading questions off the Stern Fan Network message board.  That's how he's doing his show right now.  Do you know, he's on now, right?  He's only on tonight.  No, he's on tonight.  Pest Radio, Howard 101, 8 p.m. to 12 midnight.  I'd like to go in there and do the Pulp Fiction dance. 
[01:56:30]  That's how a couple of men should square off sharks in the jet.  And, by the way, most of our pests are not paying to listen to that horse shit.  They have their ways.  Absolutely not.  Because that's another thing.  Well, we got them paying to listen.  No, you don't.  If you hit the Pal Talk war room, which we hope people do,  because, believe it or not, they don't have caller ID in there  because I've gotten on every night so far.  But he's starting to recognize people's voices, the screeners.  So we need some fresh faces in there,  which is why I'm glad you guys took this today.  We need to get some people into the Pal Talk war room tonight 
[01:57:00]  to start messing with them  because they're starting to really recognize who some of us are  and they're not putting us on hold anymore.  Although, out of 11 calls last night, I think four of them were us.  So we've still got a good ratio going.  That's almost half.  Do you know what it's like when you're doing a talk show  and you've now been designated to play the clips of other men?  Do you know how awful that is to have to play the clips of an other show?  Like, that's not what you want to do as a creative person.  No.  But he's been so smashed and he's so dishonest in the fact that it bugs him 
[01:57:30]  because he has this fucking phony, I'm a rocker, drinker, heavy metal guy,  tough guy, fucking horse shit thing, which cannot go hand in hand with being honest.  And it's just now babbling about someone else's show and having to support it.  How can I be the man when you're the man?  That is a tough question.  I kind of wonder that myself.  Tough question.  Are you the man?  Who knows?  That would only make sense if it was Adam and Eve. 
[01:58:00]  I'm the man.  Yes.  You are.  Yep.  You're the...  Check under the old fig leaf.  Yes, you're right.  There's one of each at this moment in time.  So, yes, you are the man.  You the man.  And I am the bitch.  That's right.  That's the only time that would make sense.  What a fucking cornball commercial, like, product hawking mentality that is.  Why don't you just say, what's up, and stick your tongue out, wacky guy.  You the man.  Doug, we got to fly, bro.  Yeah, guys, I got to roll. 
[01:58:30]  I got some show prep to do.  Tonight is part two of Back to the Future night on Pest Radio 101.  What we're doing is we're going to take random movies now,  and we're going to mix movie quotes with O&A references.  I love it.  So, tonight is part two of Back to the Future night,  and hit the Pal Talk Room, Wackbag, or FullBlownAge.com for info on how to get in on the attack.  Bye, doll.  Thank you very much.  Later.  Kisses.  Bye-bye.  Movie quotes. 
[01:59:00]  There you go.  And O&A references.  Did you hear the silent game?  They were doing the silent game, but he kept going to the phone,  Hey, you're out there.  Ah, where are you?  Stupid ass.  That's why they call them pests.  Hey, let's say hi to the metal guys.  Sam.  Hello.  Sam Dunn and Scott McFadden, right?  Yeah, we're here.  How you doing?  Metal Headbanger's Journey.  Hello.  What's up, guys?  That's us.  We were talking about your film this morning.  Yeah, we started the show because I got a screener's copy, 
[01:59:30]  and I watched the first half hour.  Okay.  And I would have watched more, by the way, but I had other things I had to do.  Dumb shit.  I got up to you talking to Dee Schneider, and then I turned off the movie for now.  But I got to tell you, I really, really enjoyed what I saw so far.  Which one is the guy that you actually see on camera?  That's me, Sam.  Oh, hey, Sam.  What's up?  Sam.  You're the guy that's been into metal since, what, 13, 12?  Yeah, something like that.  Even a little bit younger, I think, actually. 
[02:00:00]  How old are you now?  32.  Okay.  The weird part, though, is you come from just a little town in Canada, right?  That's right, yeah.  It's as far west as you can go.  It's right near Seattle.  Well, dude, obviously, I haven't seen it.  I got a copy yesterday, but I haven't seen it.  But they were saying that you credit Sabbath with a lot of stuff, which made me really happy.  Yeah, I guess we should set this up, Sam and Scott.  But Jim Norton's in the studio, and he honestly thinks that there's only one band out there,  and that band is Black Sabbath. 
[02:00:30]  No joke.  It's an ongoing thing on our show that frustrates the hell out of us.  He says stuff like Led Zeppelin is overrated, and I mean, just crazy stuff.  He's a lunatic.  And if you make fun of Ozzy or anyone in Black Sabbath, we pretty much fight.  Yep.  It's pretty much fisticuffs.  Well, Tony Iommi was a big part of our film, and he's very articulate.  He's great.  Yeah, I know.  I had lunch with him one day.  Oh, we know.  I did.  I spent an hour and 45 with Tone, and then went to the Sabbath induction at the Rock and 
[02:01:00]  Roll Hall of Fame, and got a picture with the entire band.  Cool.  Yeah, and I hijacked it and asked them a lot of questions, and nobody will send me the audio.  I want to fucking spit in everyone's face.  They were so disgusted, dude.  And every time one of the other reporters tried to ask one of their fucking hack reporter,  so you got a new album in the works, I was fucking Ralph Rude.  I was interrupting, just asking when I wanted to and editorializing.  Yeah, so the movie Metal, A Headbanger's Journey, you start with who invented the genre, 
[02:01:30]  and you're pretty much saying Black Sabbath, right?  Yeah, pretty much.  I mean, yeah.  I mean, you're right.  I mean, I've met guys just like Jim Norton, so we need to please those guys.  But I think that there were a lot of bands, like Zeppelin's often been credited, so is  Purple, but I think Sabbath was, as we say in the film, the first band that sounded evil,  and I think that that is really kind of, became the definitive mark of heavy metal.  But what I found interesting, you know, it's the history, obviously, the genre, and you  talk about other bands before Black Sabbath, and I'm like, wow, that's kind of strange, 
[02:02:00]  like Cream, Hendrix.  Yeah.  Blue Cheer, I think you said, right?  Blue Cheer, yeah.  Mountain.  And why Cream, though?  Well, I mean, they were the first power trio.  I mean, and for, I think, a lot of people at that time, when they, you know, they sounded  certainly a lot heavier and, you know, more intense.  I mean, Ginger Baker's drumming was sort of like the closest thing you could get to a  metal drummer at that point.  So we just wanted to be comprehensive, you know? 
[02:02:30]  We just wanted to throw some bands in there, because it really wasn't our goal to end the  debate per se.  I mean, the debate will go on, right?  But we got for Sabbath.  Well, most of the guys you interviewed, they flat out said Sabbath.  There wasn't even a second band they even mentioned.  Hermits Hermits.  They really started it, if you want to look back a little further.  Lemmy said Deep Purple.  Yeah, Deep Purple.  Lemmy did?  Yeah.  Lemmy doesn't even know where he is, so we can't...  Lemmy is a good friend.  Dude, how good is he? 
[02:03:00]  Lemmy is incredibly smart, actually.  How great is 1916?  Is that the best song ever written?  No.  All right.  What's the best song ever written?  Run to the Hills by Iron Man.  Oh, man.  Yeah, right on.  Here's what's the problem with Run to the Hills.  That's a good one.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  It's a great song.  It's a rip-off of a Sabbath song.  This is what he's going to say.  See, this is why we didn't want you guys on the air today, because we have to deal with  this shit again.  It's a great song.  It could be the best opening to a song for a long time, but it's fucking not the greatest. 
[02:03:30]  There's only two verses to it.  I wish it was longer.  Oh, wow.  I actually don't know if I prefer that or Murders in the Room Warg for Iron Maiden.  That's one of my favorite.  Run to the Hills is just such a great anthem.  It's amazing.  I just wish there was one more verse to it.  Because I was bobbing along on the couch last night when you played a little bit of  Bruce Dickinson with the short hair now, by the way, singing overseas.  We could maybe scrape up a dance version of Run to the Hills if that gets you excited. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, I would like that.  But I wish there was one more verse, because it's like two great verses, and then it just  goes into, run, to the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the last five minutes.  That's all right, though.  I prefer another verse.  I enjoyed it that much.  Sam, and I appreciate the excitement.  You were really getting into interviewing these guys, man.  You're hardcore.  Yeah, well, you know, what can I say?  I mean, this is music I've lived with for a long, long time, so, you know, when you get  a chance to meet all, you know, or many of your idols within the span of a few months 
[02:04:30]  of making a film, it's pretty cool.  Yeah, how tall is Ronnie James Dio?  We all know he's short, but, man, and your film, you make it very obvious, because the  whole band walks up, and he's barely in camera range.  I looked over, because Dio hugged Sam at the end of the interview, and it kind of looked  like Gandalf and Bilbo hugging him.  He can't be more than what, 5'4"?  Yeah, I think he's about 5'4", which is about a foot shorter than me, so.  And you know he's wearing some kind of heel, so it might even be shorter than that. 
[02:05:00]  Exactly.  But he was really cool in the movie as well.  The other thing we mentioned today, I don't want to give away everything I saw, but I just,  you know, wrote down some interesting things that I saw already.  The Mayhem band.  Yep.  It seemed like you were horrified interviewing Mayhem, Sam.  They were just a little drunk.  I mean, they had just got off the stage of the Valken Festival, you know, 40,000 people.  They'd been drinking all day, and, you know, there's like a crowd of people standing behind 
[02:05:30]  me as I was doing the interview, so.  And they weren't, as you can see, weren't particularly interested in doing an interview  that day, but they're actually pretty nice guys.  They were just a little hammered.  Well, they seem like they're the real deal, because we were joking about this this morning,  like some of these bands, they just want to have that attitude, you know, the fake attitude,  but then you got the band to have the real attitude.  The real deal, yeah.  And they seem to have that, because their ex-lead singer, what, blew his head off, killed  himself with a shotgun, and then these guys decide to make, like, necklaces out of the  skull fragments? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's just a small chapter of a long Mayhem story.  Why'd he shoot himself?  Well, he nicknamed himself Dead, right?  And he actually, he thought he would feel more comfortable amongst the dead rather than  the living.  So there you go.  And this is the, we had a little, not an argument, a little discussion this morning.  Now, when you're doing stuff that is that crazy, are you doing it because your music isn't  as good? 
[02:06:30]  Because we brought up, like, Gigi Allen, and then we were talking about Mayhem and  how, you know, if you're taking the bone, the skull fragments of a band member making  necklaces, how good can the music really be?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, in the case of Mayhem, when they started, they were kind of, they definitely  had something new.  They were kind of like the punk rock of metal, and that's kind of where the whole Norwegian  black metal thing started.  But then with, you know, some events around the band and then the whole church burning  thing, it's sort of, it could sort of completely kind of blew out of proportion. 
[02:07:00]  So I think where Mayhem started was in the right place, but I think they have a bit of  an uneasy relationship with their, you know, status as probably the most controversial  metal band of all time, so.  You know who I thought was actually an underrated band, because their lyrics were all satanic,  like, I always enjoyed Venom, but I always thought Merciful Fate was actually underrated  as a band.  I thought they were very good.  Yeah.  But it's too bad.  I really wanted to interview the king, King Diamond, but fortunately we didn't get to  him.  But, I mean, I think you're right. 
[02:07:30]  I mean, it was, they were a tough band though, right?  Because, you know, his vocals were just so over the top that either people loved it or  just couldn't stand it.  He had a great voice though.  I mean, the vocal range he had, people thought the guy in Zebra sang like really high pitch,  but fucking King Diamond was amazing.  Oh yeah, amazing.  Totally.  Hey, what else do we get to see in this movie?  Because like I said, I stopped it right at the Dee Schneider point.  Well, yeah, you stopped at the Dee Schneider.  We actually go to Norway in our religion section and we talk to some of the people that burned 
[02:08:00]  down the churches and talk to a priest whose church was burned down.  Well, we also talk about, well, we do several chapters after that.  We look at gender and religion and violence.  And with gender, we look at, you know, the whole cross-dressing phenomenon and the glam  metal scene.  I think you guys will probably get a kick out of that because it's pretty hilarious.  Some of the things that Dee has to say about guys getting up there and looking like girls, 
[02:08:30]  you know, and the audience is male.  So what the hell is going on?  Jimmy doesn't find that funny, by the way.  I don't find what funny.  I actually missed that last sign.  Yeah, cross-dressing, you know, rock stars, the glam rock and all that.  You take that very seriously, Jimmy.  Well, I find that they're biting, as we say in the rap community, off of a lot of my transgendered  friends.  And I think, I think what a man does with a girl, wink, is up to them.  And yeah, we talk, we also talk to like the guys in Slipknot about how, you know, metal 
[02:09:00]  has always been blamed for causing violence in society, you know, inspiring kids to kill  one and each other and commit suicide and stuff like that.  So we sort of talk to them about that and how metal's always been an easy scapegoat for  the, for the ills of society.  Yeah, when I saw Tipper Gore again, I was like, ugh, ugh.  But that hair is still fantastic.  Well, she was the one that was front in that whole movement back in what, 85, 86, somewhere  around there?  Yeah, that's right.  I'm sorry to interrupt you. 
[02:09:30]  Was she, was she trying to, because I know Aerosmith thanked her for selling an extra  amount of more CDs.  Was she trying to have music censored or just labeled?  No, labels.  Well, initially, I think initially they wanted it censored.  Okay, absolutely.  What they soon realized is the best that they could do was just the stickering of albums.  But I think probably if Tipper had her full way, if maybe, you know, Dee and some of the  other artists weren't so articulate on the stand, you know, that she might have got, you 
[02:10:00]  know, more of a, you know, more of a censorship going on there.  But it was basically just a stickering campaign.  Yeah, in the end, it's great that she did a lot of these bands a favor, but I mean, that's  not what, that wasn't her intention going into it.  Not at all.  Obviously.  I mean, but, you know.  Well, you want it that much more if it's not, if you're not supposed to have it, right?  You want to hear our greatest heavy metal moment?  Yes.  We were at Ozzfest a couple years back.  Was I, sorry?  We were at Ozzfest a couple years back, and we had an interview, oh my God, what's his 
[02:10:30]  name?  Phil Anselmo.  Huh?  Phil Anselmo.  Yeah, yeah.  And all of a sudden, it was time for the interview, and he had to be carried in.  Yeah, he was the real deal.  He had to be carried in.  He swore he wasn't on heroin.  He said it was only methadone or something like that.  Oh, man.  And he was basically dead standing up, and then he sat down and proceeded to tell us that  death is overrated.  Yeah.  Because he's been there.  And he meant it. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  And the beauty is, he meant it.  Yeah, because we were talking about, I guess, the time he did OD, and he died for a little  while and came back, and we asked him if he saw anything, because that's the question  you've got to ask everybody.  Of course.  And he said nothing.  He said there's absolutely nothing, and that death is overrated.  You guys got some really good people in here, obviously, Iommi and Dickinson and Zombie  and Cooper.  Dee Snider, I mean, he's, again, a big spokesman.  And did you try to get, like, Ozzy and Marilyn Manson and guys that just, that people said  no?  Yeah, I mean, there were people we tried to get. 
[02:11:30]  Like Lars or anybody from Italian?  We had a long, long, long list of people we wanted.  Yeah.  How much did Gene Simmons want to be interviewed?  Good point.  Someone actually takes a shot at him in the movie.  I loved it.  Who said that Gene Simmons invented breathing and leather shoes?  Who?  Because it's something we have talked about about somebody else on radio, but I think  it might have been Ronnie James Dio.  Yeah, Dio said he didn't breathe.  Because, yeah, because they were talking about the devil thing.  Yeah, the devil horn sign. 
[02:12:00]  And Ronnie James Dio goes, yeah, well, Gene Simmons also claims that he came up with this.  And then just smashed him and said he also claims that he invented breathing and this  and that.  Well, wasn't that finger thing, there was some Sabbath album that was on the cover of  the book that came with the album, which it might have been Mob Rules, the fist breaking  through the cross with the two fingers, like the pointer finger.  Are you now saying that Sabbath is responsible for the devil horn?  No, no, the cross.  Oh, okay. 
[02:12:30]  The Sabbath created the cross.  The cross.  No, no, I'm just saying I think that was the first time I saw Dio with that symbolism,  symbolism, if it's symbolism.  Hey, any spinal tap moments during your interviews and whatnot?  Well, I think the necro butcher scene with mayhem at the Valken Festival is kind of spinal  tap, I guess.  Yeah, that's a little over the top.  Can I tell you my spinal tap moment?  Oh, of course.  It's really simple.  I was watching the movie last night, right?  It's a metal headbagger's journey, and the film's pretty good. 
[02:13:00]  It starts, and I swear to you, Anthony, it starts with sort of like a little montage  or whatever.  I swear I thought it was spinal tap footage.  Yeah.  And then went, oh my God, this is why the spinal tap movie's so brilliant.  They nailed it.  Because you were showing all the bands, you know, really doing it, you know, Ronnie James  Dio and the rest of them.  But I really thought it opened up with spinal tap.  Well, actually, it opened with a heavy metal parking lot.  So have you ever seen that?  No.  A 50-minute documentary shot in a parking lot of Jews pre-show in the 80s in Maryland. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, wow.  So it's, that's where we've got to see that.  I'm shocked you haven't seen that.  I know.  It's right up my alley.  So where does the metal movement end?  I mean, it seems like they're trying to top each other, right, with the outrageousness  and stuff, or?  Yeah.  I mean, well, I think one of the myths we tried to debunk in the film was that metal  died in the 80s, right?  That's what everyone assumed.  Well, the hairband type thing did, yeah. 
[02:14:00]  And it was, it was killed, you know, killed by the hands of grunge, you know?  And I think that the reality is, is, you know, metal's an underground form of music that  will really never go away, you know?  And, and I think that's kind of one of the messages we try to send in the film is that  that's, that's, that's where it subsists and it will always be there, you know?  It seems like with metal, I mean, you can only get so heavy.  Like, I was, I was listening to, uh, I think it was the Boneyard the other night, which  is an XM station, which plays all metal.  They don't play as heavy.  Liquid metal's coming back.  Yeah, liquid metal's coming back.  Really heavy.  But this show had on, I was fucking Hella Waits by Slayer, which you never hear on the 
[02:14:30]  radio anywhere.  And, uh, it was, I forgot how great of a tune that was and how great of like a riff.  Yeah.  Uh, and it's like, you can't get any heavier than that.  You just, you can't.  I mean, I think anything faster than that, they'd consider probably punk.  And then you start losing any song at all.  It becomes just kind of how fast can you play, how loud and how monstrous can you make your  voice sound?  Death metal, I never really like, I, I, I, it's its own style, but I just never did it 
[02:15:00]  for me.  I always like some kind of a music to it.  Yeah.  Something you can hum, tap your foot to.  Something you can rape grandma to.  You took the words right out of my mouth.  So what's the movie about, man?  I mean, obviously it's about heavy metal, but is it about your journey becoming a heavy  metal fan?  Yeah, essentially it's a, it's a, it's a road movie that follows me as a fan, but also as  an anthropologist.  So, uh, it's essentially like a, like a study of heavy metal through the eyes of a guy that's  been listening to this music since he was, you know, really young. 
[02:15:30]  So the idea is to try and understand why it is that metal is that, you know, that style  of music that people either love or they either hate.  What is it about this music that tends to polarize people?  So that's essentially kind of the question that we ask.  And then that sets us off on the road.  It also follows you around as an alcoholic too.  I mean, there's a lot of Jaeger, Jaeger and beer in Germany and waking up hung over.  It sounds like fun.  Yeah, it's a hell of a job if you can get it.  Hey, uh, did anybody badmouth Sabbath? 
[02:16:00]  Oh, I got to be careful here.  We had to cut the parts out where Tony was badmouthing Ozzy, but, uh, no, we.  That's fine.  Tony can do that.  It was, it was treading the lines, but we cut that out, but.  What's that?  Who did?  Tony.  Tony Aimee.  Oh, all right.  That's fine.  Aimee gets here what he wants.  Yeah.  It's Tony, yeah.  When we had lunch, he had a Cobb salad.  He did?  Yes.  I had a club sandwich and Tony had a Cobb salad and he's a very nice guy.  We had quite a good time. 
[02:16:30]  He's so healthy and doing well for his age.  What's that?  He's doing so well for his age.  It's amazing.  Dude, he's in fantastic shape.  He's a good dresser.  Of course he is.  We know.  Guy's in love over here.  He's in love.  One other thing and then we'll let you guys go.  I've been hearing about this band Lamb of God.  I've never, I'm not going to lie to you.  I've never heard an actual song, but a lot of people saying they're like the new Metallica  and stuff.  Yeah.  What's that all about?  I saw them being interviewed in the movie as well. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  I mean, the title sequence of our movie has got a song by Lamb of God.  So, if you saw the first half of the movie, you have heard them.  I mean, they are kind of a return to the kind of thrash metal days and I guess they're a  great band.  They are a really good band.  They've been busting their ass in the underground for like 10 years.  They've been together for 10 years.  And so now, you know, they've got a major record label deal and they're really pushing  it.  So, the kind of, I guess their story kind of mimics Metallica in a way. 
[02:17:30]  And the greatest thing is that I can't imagine them coming out with a song like Nothing Else  Matters.  Right.  So, I think we're in good hands with Lamb of God.  Then again, we go back about, you know, a few years, you can't imagine Metallica would  actually do that.  No, it's true.  It's true.  What do you think of Metallica and what they're doing these days?  Well, it's been a while now, obviously, but they're less.  I mean, to be honest with you, I hated St. Anger.  It was choppy, right?  It seemed like it was kind of just thrown together. 
[02:18:00]  It seemed like there was...  Yeah, I know.  You know, for me, it's a sad story.  I mean, I think that, you know, with St. Anger, they tried to return to what they originally  were about and I don't think they really nailed it.  Although, they're recording their new album with Rick Rubin.  So, you know, I've got high hopes.  Every Metallica album, I always have high hopes.  How funny is it, man?  All these bands, when they fail miserably, time to call up Rick Rubin.  Yeah, Rick Rubin.  Time to call up Rick Rubin.  The guy can't come back.  He's fucking just great, man.  He can produce anything.  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  I mean, the problem with Metallica, right, was that the band started paying too much attention  to what was going on around them.  Dude, they got a...  And they tried to mimic certain sounds of other bands that were going on at the time.  And what made Metallica great is they just didn't pay attention to any of that stuff.  They got a therapist, though, man.  And that documentary is amazing to watch with that stupid therapist trying to talk out the,  you know, the problems that the band was having with each other.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  And James Hetfield, like, I can only give you guys an hour a week.  I got kids and they got to go to ballet and I got to pick them up and they got kickball practice. 
[02:19:00]  You know what people don't understand?  I could give you an hour a week.  And Lars is like, what the fuck?  People just don't get the fact that a lot of these bands, they start out when they're in their teens.  Yeah.  And then they just got older.  You got your thinking changes, your lifestyle changes.  You get a family, maybe.  And then all of a sudden, there is no way you can go back to what you were because it's a different person.  It's like, you might as well grab someone off the street and try to throw them in your place because you're just as different a person as a stranger. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  And most of these great bands, they were great because they basically lived together.  Yeah.  Literally sleeping in the same bed because there was nowhere else to sleep.  And, you know, you get the creative juices going and then you get some success.  You get some money.  It's like, well, I'm buying my mansion over here and you're buying it on the other coast.  We'll try to get together to write some stuff.  You know what?  Fair enough.  I agree.  But Slayers always maintain their thing.  And granted, Slayer never sold as many records as Metallica. 
[02:20:00]  Some guys have been able to pull it off.  But they've stuck to their guns, you know.  And they still have, you know, I think a lot of respect with the fans.  Well, let me ask you, though.  Like, you mentioned Nothing Else Matters.  Like, I love that song.  I really like it.  Did you not like that?  No.  See, I really dug that.  Locky Power Ballad.  No, but I thought it was actually like.  No, you're talking to a guy.  It's all about metal.  He's like true metal all the way.  He doesn't want to acknowledge that any of these bands have a wimpy side to him.  It all started, by the way, with Kiss on Destroyer doing Beth.  That's when it's like. 
[02:20:30]  It's a good song.  Beth's a good song.  Stop it.  No, it's not.  It is.  He's out playing the music.  He's not going to be home.  What is she going to do?  Should she order Chinese?  I can almost handle.  I hear you.  Call in.  Come on.  But no, I love Nothing Else Matters.  I like it.  I think it's a good time.  I really, really like the Black Album.  Yeah.  That's not the popular thing.  But that's the other album that everybody says.  Blah, blah, blah.  How could they not like Wherever I May Roam and Sad But True?  Sad But True is a great song.  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  You don't like Wherever I May Roam?  It's not bad.  It's not bad.  Oh, wow.  Enter Sandman?  No.  I like too popular.  Now, do you not like it because it's not a good song or because it got the video that  became so popular?  Sold out, man.  They sold out.  No.  It's got another.  It's got.  I mean, for me, it's just not my taste, right?  Okay.  I mean, it's like they're not.  That's a pop song.  Yeah.  Sam.  With a master of puppets.  Unforgiven?  It's all right.  Different.  Sam, we know you're hardcore metal, okay? 
[02:21:30]  Just give us something.  What is one of those wimpy bands you listen to that you're like, oh, man.  Well, when I was 13, I loved Home Sweet Home by Motley Crue.  That's all right.  That's all right.  You have no guilty pleasure where you roll the windows up, make sure no one can hear,  and you crank up a little ABBA.  Yeah, you know, the old iPod gag.  What's that song in your iPod that you're like, oh, God, I hope no one catches me?  Come on, tough guy.  What is it?  Where you relabel it so, you know, it looks like it's, I don't know, arch enemy or something. 
[02:22:00]  Maybe a little Shania Twain in my most guilty moments, you know.  Yeah, why not?  You got to enjoy it.  Occasionally, I'll play Do You Want to Hurt Me?  Who doesn't like that in their iPod?  You do?  I certainly do.  I have an iPod full of shit.  It's just full of crap.  Shit pod.  It is.  It is just shit pod.  Very good, sir.  All right.  Guys, anything else you want to add to that?  Well, sir, our film is playing in New York this weekend, April 21st, April 22nd. 
[02:22:30]  That's not this weekend.  A couple weeks.  No, might want to explain a calendar.  You can also go to our website, which is www.mentalhistory.com.  That is three Ws, sir.  Sir, you really are an alcoholic.  www.  That was like back in the mid-90s when people tried to do it. 
[02:23:00]  H-T-T-P colon slash backslash backslash W dot W.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Metalhistory.com, right?  That's all you need to say.  We're to the point now that we don't even need the Ws.  We can pretty much skip the Ws.  We laugh at the Ws.  We laugh at the Ws.  All right.  But it looks like I'm going to watch the rest of the movie tonight.  Good luck with it, man.  Hey, where is it playing?  Just everywhere?  It's in 14 cities across the U.S. and 25 countries coming up.  Is it going to be in my artsy theater where I have to order the smoked salmon sandwich? 
[02:23:30]  I don't know.  The landmark sunshine.  Where is that?  Oh.  Oh, it's a Houston.  Yeah, Houston.  Houston Street.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, the sunshine.  I know where that is.  How much of a premiere there?  Yeah.  You guys will do good.  And then forget it.  DVD.  That's where you make your money, guys.  Good luck, man.  Unless, of course, people burn them and, you know, give them out.  That would be good publicity.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Right on.  Done.  See you, boys.  All right.  Later, man. 
[02:24:00]  Thank you, guys.  Cheers.  See you.  It's Metal, A Headbanger's Journey, coming to a theater near you.  Cool.  Sometime in April.  Sometime.  I sure could go for another cup of Joe.  Anyone else?  My treat.  Who liked my arch enemy reference?  That was very good.  I did, too, as you read it out of the...  I was wondering how you were going to pull it out of your ass.  Hey, guys.  I mean, let's be honest.  There are no...  I mean, there are no...  It's not like it's the...  No Slipknot.  Hum-na-hum-na-hum-na-hum-na.  That's why I'm calling myself out on it, man. 
[02:24:30]  Because I got caught.  I'm like, well, all right, you relabeled the song some cool metal band.  I can't use the basics.  I'm thinking...  No.  It's no four...  Oh, wait.  That's the page number.  I just wish I...  Yeah.  I just wish I went to the next page.  I would have used Cannibal Corpse, actually.  Ah, yeah.  That would have been a perfect one.  Yeah.  But I got to Arch Enemy and said, good enough.  Good enough.  Good enough.  Oh, coffee.  See, look how we tear down the second wall today.  Isn't that nice?  Do you want a coffee?  Isn't that nice for everybody?  No, too late in the morning.  I can't do coffee this late.  No, I don't drink coffee. 
[02:25:00]  Check.  Check.  Fine.  Good.  Mike checks good.  Beautiful.  I like when we talk through this.  Let's do the rest of the show talking through our wah-wah bottles.  Okay.  That sounds like a lot of fun.  I remember when I was a kid...  For a second.  ...and my cousin John was there.  I picked him up.  I was probably like 11, and he was like 14.  Yeah.  And I'm playing outside, and I had a bottle, and I kept going, wah-wah penis.  I kept saying wah-wah penis into it.  Why would you say wah-wah penis, Jimmy? 
[02:25:30]  I don't know.  Just because it was funny.  I thought it was funny, and then we had an argument, and he kicked me in the balls.  Oh.  Jesus.  Rich Voss?  Yeah.  What's going on, larynx cancer?  Dave in Denver.  Dave.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  That thin air.  I want to let you know that last segment, man.  You guys are killing me, man.  And the one before that was ripping on Pharrell.  So I just want to let you guys know.  Keep it up, man.  And right on.  I'm punching out.  Thank you.  Hey, what happened, man?  I'm from Denver.  Right on, Jimmy.  Ben, what happened with these guys?  We're checking these guys on the phone to do these phoners, man. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, let's get another phoner in.  Hey, can we get the Pantera Phil PS8 thing going into a break?  Should we do that?  Yeah, let's take a break.  Okay.  I thought we were all going to talk into our water bottle.  I don't want to.  Oh, but you're crying.  It's fun.  Open up your water bottle and talk into it, for God's sake.  I don't want to.  It's a lot of fun.  If you're at home with a water bottle, I'd like you to join in and play along at home,  because it is really a lot of fun.  That's right.  It's Thirsty Thursday, Sharon.  The OPS report.  It's thirsty.  It's Water Bottle Thursday. 
[02:26:30]  Water Bottle Thursday.  Thursday.  Open, just try it.  You've got the bottle right there.  I don't want to.  Could you please?  I want to bring us back in to break through the water bottle.  I don't want a water bottle.  It's so much fun to do once you start.  We're quality.  Go ahead.  Just say hi.  Son of a bitch.  That doesn't play along.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Penis.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Penis.  That's because you couldn't pronounce want yet. 
[02:27:00]  No.  First of all, it hurt my feelings.  I certainly could.  I was at 11.  I wasn't one.  I wasn't yelling want want penis.  I just thought it was funny to go wah wah.  And he goes, why are you yelling wah wah penis?  And then they kicked you in the nuts.  Well, no.  That was like late.  I think there's actually two different arguments I put together.  One was in Boston.  Hey, that wasn't fair.  That wasn't honest right there.  We tried to do honest radio.  But it was a mistake.  Actually, it was a mistake.  Some correction.  It was wah wah penis.  Thud. 
[02:27:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  Oh, no.  But I was correcting myself.  I felt that I did something I shouldn't have done.  All right.  Let's play the PSA.  Let's play the PSA.  So, you think being a rock and roll superstar is fun?  Did you just say something?  Sure it is.  Just ask Phil from Pantera.  Who?  That would be you, Phil.  What?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Just start the bit.  One, two, three, five.  I've lived a hardcore life.  That's right. 
[02:28:00]  Horrific.  What?  What?  Who?  When I was 15 years old, I burned my parents' house down.  I believe it's good.  Multiple paranoia, destitute, sickness, awful.  I feel great.  I've smoked dope.  Long time alcoholic.  I felt like a walking Slayer concert.  You are killing me.  Ow!  So, put down those books and pick up that guitar, and you could be just like Phil from Pantera.  Damn.  Good. 
[02:28:30]  Shut up.  Let's do it!  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Water Bottle Thursday here.  Is it on?  On the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Welcome back.  Thanks for tuning in.  That's the Aussie song, and now we're reading Hustler Magazine, ready to get into a bit.  Wonderful job, Jimmy.  Thank you.  On Water Bottle Thursday.  That's right.  Thirsty Thursdays.  And everybody thought this bit would be over by the time we came back from break.  We all know Surybom.  By the way, if you're trying to get the wah-wah penis as your whack bag name, done. 
[02:29:00]  It's over, Johnny.  Someone now has wah-wah penis as their name.  Welcome, wah-wah penis.  There's W-A-W-A, and then there's wah-wah W-A-H.  There can be two wah-wah penises.  Wah-wah penises.  Wonderful.  Wow.  Love when the Hustlers come in.  Yes.  Brand new Hustler.  I remember getting Playboy, getting your hands on Playboy as a kid, and you'd open it up, 
[02:29:30]  and a lot of articles, and you really have to search it out.  Hustler is so easy.  Doesn't matter.  Watch.  There we go.  Look, even though they're trying to do something with Washington crossing the Potomac,  there's a chick with her tits showing.  Let's try again.  All right.  Whoa, there we go.  See, that's what I love about Hustler.  You just open it, and you're jacking in seconds.  Do it again.  Okay, there it is. 
[02:30:00]  Three for three.  You're not going to come across some political interview or any kind of nonsense.  Three for fucking three.  It's all about the bush.  Wow.  That guy is getting his hefty hog serviced.  My goodness.  I love Hustler.  One of the few magazines I think that are still doing well because they have it back down.  The movie memories section.  What is that? 
[02:30:30]  The movie memories.  Is that where they show tits of famous people?  Yeah.  Where is that in there?  What page?  That would be page 63.  Because I like that.  Katie Holmes in The Gift.  They used to call it Sex in Cinema in one of the other magazines, and it was always very  hot seeing your favorite starlet.  You know, I did movie reviews for these people.  I'd love to do more.  Why aren't you?  I don't know, Ant.  I'd love to get to the bottom of it.  I can't find it.  Maybe you don't want to know the answer to that.  I'll be, I would like to know the answer. 
[02:31:00]  One thing that's horrible about these magazines, they never put the page numbers on.  It's right there.  It's not.  Yes, look at that.  Yeah, it's like, I'm up to 104.  Look at 126.  I can't find 63.  It goes 64, blank, blank, blank.  Look at 126, the cartoon.  It's just great.  Hustler has, that guy, Jay Billet, or Billet, draws the funniest shit.  How many hell do you get to 126?  You've turned pages, and after 125, you've stopped.  See, I told you, there's no pages.  126.  Yes.  Why don't you explain that cartoon for everybody there, Jimmy? 
[02:31:30]  I want to wait until Sweetie Pie gets to it.  Damn it.  Hurry up, Ant.  I'll come over there.  I'll grab your cock.  Ant's not good at finding pages.  Ant, Ant, find the page.  It's the second page you can't find.  122, 23.  There's no number on 24.  And then it goes to 27.  Hey, what happened?  All right, so there's 126, the one before 127.  27, some, but put a, put a, put a number on it.  Why?  It's close enough.  Oh, wait, I just got to beaver hunt.  Okay, here we go. 
[02:32:00]  I hope you're still not mad that I, they should.  Holy disgusting.  The fucking, the cartoon is the guy is in the, the guy's in the bathroom, and he's combing  his hair, obviously looking into the mirror, and he's, you know, the sex has been over,  and the, and the thing, the caption reads, I hope you're not still mad that I came in  your mouth, and, and closer to you in the picture is a cranky looking woman squatting  over his shoe, taking a shit in it. 
[02:32:30]  They have the greatest cartoon.  Shitting in his shoe.  Greatest cartoons.  Oh, okay.  Oh, Sunny Lane, I know her.  I bet you do.  I really wanted to fuck her, and I never, I never did.  Penelope Cruz, uh, tits with hairy armpit.  That's, um, interesting.  She's got a nice set, though.  Mimi Rogers, oof, what the hell is going on there?  Nicole Kidman, movie memories, Katie Holmes from The Gift, which was, uh, very good.  What's up with Katie Holmes? 
[02:33:00]  We were looking at pictures today on the website, and, uh...  Rumors running rampant, Toby, that she's not actually pregnant, that that is some type  of device that she has wrapped around her, uh, to make people think she's pregnant.  Uh, she hasn't widened out anywhere else.  Wait, that they're going to just adopt a baby?  Yeah, that perhaps...  It is strange, Jimmy, because...  A perfect genetic baby.  Well, you know, I'm, you know, I, you're like...  I mean, he must have just threw some in her.  What the hell?  Yeah.  Is it, is it, I mean, I'm just saying, is it possible medically for a man to open 
[02:33:30]  this asshole over her vagina and let semen leak into it and still get somebody pregnant?  I mean, I'm just talking.  But, you know...  I don't think she's pregnant.  But then, you look at these pictures more and more, and she hasn't gained a pound except  for belly, and I know some girls can pull that off, but there's absolutely nothing else  going on with her entire body.  And they got a picture on this one website, uh, what is it called?  PopSugar.  Yeah, PopSugar.com.  Go up.  Go up.  She looks like Talia Shire when Carlo was beating her and she was pregnant.  She was all skinny except for that belly. 
[02:34:00]  It's the same body.  She didn't get fat in the hips.  She didn't get fat in her face.  It is just this belly sticking out.  Her tits didn't get bigger.  It's a weird picture, man.  And she's supposed to be ready to drop, you know?  Well, she's going to drop just in time for Mission Impossible 3.  Whoa, big surprise there.  And then...  Wow, you're going to have a baby the same week the movie comes out.  Who saw that coming?  They probably have adopted a little white baby, you know?  Uh, and then when, when she's supposed to deliver, they'll, they'll do that secret Scientology 
[02:34:30]  thing to keep everything a secret.  She'll pull off her little pillow and, uh, she'll walk around, uh, a couple of weeks later  with some newborn that they adopted.  Throw some water on her face and she'll walk out of the house.  Right.  Woof, woof, woof.  That was a toughie.  Woof.  But, uh, I don't know.  This picture...  Eh.  What do you think, Jimmy?  Her boobs aren't bigger at all.  They're the exact same size.  It's just her gut sticking out.  It's hard to say. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, it definitely is, but...  I mean, I, I just don't, uh...  Wait, are we getting these people on...  Hold on.  I'm sorry, guys.  Hmm.  Where are you going?  Jimmy, you're doing your interview live on our show.  Jimmy, they're not leaving for an interview.  Jimmy Norton!  What a pussy.  Jimmy Norton...  Did he really leave?  Because it's more important to him to get his plugs in on...  Here comes Jimmy back.  ...on other radio shows.  Jimmy?  I'll do it in here.  Okay.  I'll straighten them out a little bit.  Why, what happened?  Nothing.  You straighten out our producers?  Anyway.  They were, they were dropping phone calls two at a time. 
[02:35:30]  I had to fire a gas in there.  Oh, did you?  That's better.  Oh, oh, must be just the worst.  Thank you for not doing that in here, by the way.  Of course, guys.  We got Rush Limbaugh saying some silly things.  We got South Park talking about the hybrid car.  I like the Rush.  We got the FU calls from a real drunk in Minnesota.  It could be good, too.  Leave a call after call after call.  Really?  We love the FU line.  You got to be drunk in Minnesota.  It sucks at promos.  What?  Ooh.  Adam.  Yeah?  You're going to hurt my feelings. 
[02:36:00]  What do I suck at?  Go on now.  Huh?  Go on now.  What do I suck at?  He decides everything, according to most people.  It sounds like you're reading from a script.  It kind of sucks.  What?  When?  When?  When?  Yeah.  Like Bodog, the Bodog one.  You're like, we were.  Oh, that shit.  We were.  Of course.  We were.  What do you think?  We go in there and wing it?  Yeah.  Oh, although I did one day.  Had that turnout, Steve.  Oh, thanks.  Not good.  Fucking had to wing a goddamn breed one day.  You know what?  I don't even, um, I don't hear that stuff after we do it for Steve. 
[02:36:30]  The Bodog one sounds really forced in red?  Yeah.  All right.  I'll redo it.  There are a couple, I must say, that we do that on purpose with.  But there are a couple where I heard where, uh, Steve, I don't want to critique.  Steve, could you please come in here?  Well, thank you.  I don't want to critique Steve.  Critique him.  Because he's very big.  And he could hurt me.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Two seconds.  Please shut up.  Um, Steve.  What's up?  There are some spots.  Yeah.  Where we run through them.  And some errors are made.  Some gaps are between things. 
[02:37:00]  And it seems you could cut a little more of the silence out.  No.  Why?  Everything.  And that is one of the, uh, differences with satellite radio is everything's got a timeout  exactly.  So if you do one of these, uh, you know, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bing, ba-da-boom, ba-da-boom,  I'm done, boom.  And I have to make, you know, 25 seconds stretch to 29.9 seconds.  But instead of making a space in between a word to make me sound like, so go to Bodog and  learn about poker.  It makes me sound fucking retarded. 
[02:37:30]  Perhaps you can time compress or extend, expand the whole thing.  Let's throw a little music in.  How about this, Steve?  A little music at the beginning.  Dun-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de.  Oh, Dog.net.  Dog.net.  I love it.  I love, you know, something fun like that.  How about this, Steve?  Make it happen.  All right.  You know what, Jim?  That's a good philosophy, and I'll do it.  Let's go make it happen.  And I never, ever again want to receive an email with ideas, ideas for a commercial on it,  and have to go into the studio and make it up as I go along. 
[02:38:00]  I had to do that the other day.  It was an email.  It said, hey, guys, we have a new sponsor.  It's this, they do this.  That was it.  Now make 60 seconds of it.  Holy shit, was that rough.  Yeah, usually they know they're not supposed to do that.  And we're only brilliant broadcasters when we're live on the radio.  Right.  We go into the studio.  We stink.  P, part by you.  You know what the other thing is, Adam, you bring up a good point.  They also have this thing where they want Anthony and I's voice in the same thing. 
[02:38:30]  Uh-huh.  So we both read the same script and then they chop like we're talking to each other.  But, you know, I can't be bothered seeing Anthony, actually.  This is at 11.03.  Right.  Why should we be looking at each other?  Anthony does his part at 11.03.  He's out the door.  I do my part at 11.04.  Now you would think logically, just hand both of us a script,  and then there would be some chemistry there.  But we're like, we can't be bothered with that crap.  Oh, my God.  He's so right.  Why is that?  So instead, you get Anthony reading the script, me reading the script, 
[02:39:00]  and then Steve has to make it sound like it's natural conversation.  Right, like it's conversational.  You know something?  It never does.  At the beginning, we tried doing that.  Right.  It didn't work.  I don't know why.  Was it the bad copy?  Was it, like, we would try to go back and forth.  I think it was Steve.  Yes, it was.  No, it wasn't my fault.  It's because you both have, you know, ridiculous ADD,  and you interrupt each other.  And, well, Jim's in the room.  He's farting.  Wait a minute.  What are we talking about?  Exactly.  That's true.  I wanted to address it with Travis, too. 
[02:39:30]  Travis, can you come in here for me?  Travis?  No, no, no.  I don't have a problem with Travis.  I just wanted to give the information that he just gave me.  All right, Travis.  Coming in the studio here.  Is this about something important?  Yes.  What's going on here?  Woodman had to pass.  Why?  What?  I don't know.  Oh, no.  I know.  I don't know means I know.  Well, no, no.  What did they say?  Did we ruin your gig with Woodman?  No.  No, Tori.  I spoke to Tori.  Uh-huh.  And she said that, unfortunately, she got the message.  That they're not going to be able to do it today. 
[02:40:00]  All right, let's...  You don't bump fucking Jimmy Norton.  We were told to go on tape delay for tomorrow.  It was a tape-delayed interview.  Travis, answer.  Let's get her back on the phone?  Yeah.  Let's get Tori back on the phone.  I'll go right now.  After she'll come on the air, we'll be nice.  Tori, right now.  Yeah, let's get Tori back on the air.  I will bet you right now, $100, she does not agree to come on the air.  I know she won't.  I know she won't.  And I can bet you that I'm going to fuck.  As Kenny said, these last two weren't confirmed.  Oh, boy.  But I have a list of interviews to do. 
[02:40:30]  So I want to know.  Maybe they were just possibilities and they can't.  But if they were confirmed and then they decided to change their minds...  Uh-huh.  Then there's trouble.  Oh, yeah.  I'd say so.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to fuck with my money.  What are you going to do?  Are you going to dance with somebody?  They're taking food out of your little mouth.  I'm going to tie one on behind my back and do the dance.  No dancing.  I like to dance.  Will you be shaking it up before you dance?  Or is it right to the dance?  I'm going to say, how could I be wood man?  Because you're a wood man.  You're the wood man.  How could I be the man?  I know how to get him back through the whole interview through a water bottle. 
[02:41:00]  Wah, wah, penis.  Can Kenny call in?  Because Kenny is the one that knows about this.  All right.  Well, he was on the line earlier.  He was.  It kind of blew him off.  Well, let's not blow anyone off.  This could be important.  Oh, wait.  Who was I talking to that was saying the fucking word wrong and I wanted to...  Oh, no.  Impor...  Wrecking turks.  Button.  Oh.  What?  I was in my fucking car having a problem with my GPS the other night.  No.  Dude, I couldn't use it.  I kept entering where I wanted to go and it kept taking me to the old address that I had 
[02:41:30]  before it.  It's trying to help you out.  It wasn't.  Wait.  Why?  I don't know.  I just didn't know how to do it.  You have to...  Oh, that was it.  It wasn't the car.  Who knows.  I was ready to throw the caddy in the fucking room.  Why didn't you delete the old address?  I did.  And then I did and then I called up and this guy's trying to help me on the fucking helpline  on the OnStar and he kept going, all right, you have to hit the button.  He kept saying button and I wanted to fucking knock his teeth out.  He didn't know what he was.  Hold on.  Let me hit the button.  Button.  There's a red button.  You hit...  It's like, what's a fucking button, you asshole? 
[02:42:00]  There's no such thing as a button.  You think he does that on purpose?  No, he doesn't.  Just to fuck with people.  The button.  No, it's funny.  We all have problems with speech.  Every single person that's listening to the show, the people that come in here, there's  some crutch that every person has.  I can't say finger.  Right.  But if you're working for OnStar, why would you hire a guy that can't say button?  Because a majority of the problems are going to involve a button. 
[02:42:30]  Button.  You know that a majority of the problems that he has to answer is going to...  He is going to ask you to press some type of a button.  Right.  Club Soda Kenny.  Good morning, people.  How's everybody?  Hi, you civvy.  I just wanted to shed some light on this whole phoner situation.  All right.  All right.  I just confirmed Mark Bolger for Jim.  Jim, I left you a voicemail message on your cell phone.  I also emailed you.  He wanted nothing to do with going on the air with you live. 
[02:43:00]  Okay.  All right.  I can't tell you how many times he told me he does a clean show.  Oh.  And I told him, you know, you got no problem with that.  So you can call him right after you get off the air.  I left you an email and a voicemail with the hotline.  All right.  That's Mark Bolger's show.  All right.  That's fine.  All right.  Mark Bolger, shit dick.  That's what I say.  Now, what about...  Woodman in the morning.  I left him two messages and nobody's gotten back. 
[02:43:30]  Well, we got back.  Were they confirmed interviews?  No, no.  They were requests.  And I called yesterday to confirm.  And I only confirmed Reno and Frankenberry and Shrek.  I gave somebody Shrek's cell phone number if you wanted to call him on the air.  No, no, no.  Here's my question.  Okay.  So we were never confirmed with Woodman.  Why was I...  Now, I'm going to ask you...  I want to ask Bananas.  Why did they send me the information if it wasn't a confirmed interview?  Bananas, Woodman, Frankenberry, Bolger...  Well, they sent me the information and I forwarded to you the two that I confirmed and the two that I didn't confirm. 
[02:44:00]  Okay, but they were never confirmed by Bananas.  No, they were just requests.  All right.  So Woodman passed on me.  Oh.  Possibly.  I don't know.  Nobody's called me back from there.  No, we found out Woodman passed.  So I'd like to know if Woodman takes phone calls on his show.  Okay.  Because I somehow...  I'm very frustrated now that my gig is not going to be plugged on that show.  I think it should be.  I would never give up the hotline number. 
[02:44:30]  I knew it.  Boring.  Hold on.  I don't have the hotline number.  We only had the producer's contact number, which is the, like, main receptionist number  because there's, like, five radio stations, I guess, in the same building.  Boring.  Well, if anybody knows Woodman's number, I would like to get a plug out there.  Well, any fucking time, sweetheart!  I guess that wraps up this segment.  Well, Kenny, thanks.  All right.  So, Kenny, which ones were confirmed? 
[02:45:00]  Reno and Frankenberry and Shrek.  Kenny, you do realize we were on our way to a perfect radio show today.  Wow.  That's kind of my fault because I...  Now it's only going to be 99% perfect.  Who's not?  I know.  You figure out what 1% of the show went bad today.  Yeah.  No, I know.  I do a full report and email the entire company like you like to do.  I apologize for throwing the show off track.  Right.  But I'm new at this and I'm willing to learn and take constructive criticism. 
[02:45:30]  I will try harder than anybody else I know to make things work.  You see, but that's the beauty.  I'm great fodder for you guys.  Yes, you are.  All right.  Well, listen.  Continue with your genius.  I may have left my prior job under questionable circumstances, but let me assure you, I was an upstanding police officer.  This will just give me more time to devote to the boys and XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:46:00]  CeCe, Jupe and Arrow, Elo, George W. Bush.  You really got to relax with that, CeCe, man.  Yeah.  You can't CeCe the company people anymore.  How about just this crew?  No, I've done good.  I've done good.  You did, Kenny.  You've done good.  All right.  All right.  Carry on, fellas.  I'll talk to you.  Thank you, Kenny.  All right.  All right. 
[02:46:30]  Let's get Adam in New York.  Adam.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi.  Hey, Jimmy, what do you want?  I'll get it.  I just, I think that Woodman, does he take off?  Screw Woodman.  I don't work for him.  He works for Shrek.  I work for Shrek and everybody else.  What do you do?  If you want to be on Bulger's, I'll get you on live.  Oh, okay.  Well, Bulger doesn't want to do it live, so I'll do it after.  It was a tape-delayed one anyway.  It was never supposed to be live.  Yeah.  And also, you're doing it on speakerphone in the office while we're in there.  Okay.  And also-  It'll still be the show.  It's cool, man.  Woodman just didn't want to have me on, so I was hoping- 
[02:47:00]  Does he take calls on his show or no?  Yeah, but they're probably all taped.  He's a dick.  He sounds like a real fucking douche.  Top 40s douche.  Yeah, but whatever you want.  I mean, I'm working with Shrek, so we'll get you on live, but-  I'm going to call him later tonight for a tape-delayed for tomorrow morning.  That's cool.  I appreciate it, man.  All right, man.  Thanks, buddy.  Bye-bye.  Ewan, you're a mover, shaker.  I don't like that fucking Woodman.  How do you kind of pour yourself out like this?  You guys, we've got to change gears.  We've got Corey Rowe on the hotline. 
[02:47:30]  Corey?  Corey?  Hi.  Corey?  Morning.  Hey.  Morning.  How are you, sir?  Good.  Good.  How are you?  What's wrong there, Jimmy?  Nothing.  Just looking for a piece of paper.  Yeah.  Corey, you're involved with the 9-11 movie?  Yes, I am.  I am.  I'm the executive producer for the second edition and was one of the co-producers for  the first edition.  For the what?  United 93?  No, no, no.  This is for the September 11th movie, Loose Change, second edition. 
[02:48:00]  It's a documentary about September 11th and the inconsistencies in the evidence which  exists.  Oh, okay.  We got a little confused.  I'm sorry.  The name we had scheduled was Dylan.  Do we have a bio for this guy or no?  Did they print anything?  All I can do is Dylan was the one we thought was called.  Yeah, Dylan.  We were going to get Dylan on this morning.  Unfortunately, something came up.  He wasn't available, so I just kind of had to jump into the position.  I mean, if you're interested in a real quick bio.  No, no.  It's okay, man.  Unless you want to.  Yeah, this all started with Jimmy, so Jimmy, you should explain, I guess.  Well, I've always ... I'm not a believer in 9-11 conspiracy other than the fact 
[02:48:30]  that it was Muslims.  But I hear so many people talking about it, and I think that there are times where a conspiracy  is very valid, and other times where it's just ... And I'm going to quote Colin Quinn,  people doing this synthetic rebellion where they attack the government because the government  doesn't fight back.  Like, you know, when you attack like this.  Yeah.  That's what Colin's quote was, and I think he was right.  So I'm like, does anybody out there have any credible evidence or video that something  from 9-11 was a conspiracy by the government or other than Muslims? 
[02:49:00]  That hasn't been disputed and shown to just be fabrication.  Yes.  Yes, actually, there is.  No, no.  I'm just setting up how this came to be.  Oh, okay.  So I asked for that, and I got a bunch of links.  A lot of the nonsense people said, well, Bush's reaction and that nonsense about, did he see  the video first?  That's just nitpicking, and it's just ... Maybe he didn't handle it well, but that's nothing  to do with a conspiracy.  Absolutely.  But then someone sent me the loose change thing, and I watched that, and a lot of it 
[02:49:30]  I didn't agree with.  But there were certain points on it that I thought were raised that were interesting that I wasn't  well-versed enough to debate.  And I'm like, well, somebody who would have to know aeronautics and plane construction and  all that stuff might be able to debate better.  So that's how this came to be.  Absolutely.  So what is it about ... What do you think is going on with this thing, 9-11?  I'm sorry, you're fading out.  I'm sorry about it.  What do you think is going on with 9-11, and why do you think that ... What do you think 
[02:50:00]  the government's behind it?  Not only is the government behind it and complicit with the attacks, they were directly responsible  for them happening.  I mean, if you look at the activities that were going on September 11th, and you look at  the war games that were taking on with NORAD that morning, I mean, this is NORAD  having 20 hijacked jets on the screen of the FFAA controllers.  I mean, that alone just says that those people right there are looking at their radar, and  they're not seeing, they're not seeing, you know, two blips, three blips. 
[02:50:30]  They're looking at 20 hijacked jets on that screen, and they're running war games of a  plane flying into the World Trade Center, in both towers, at the same time that it supposedly  happens.  I mean, if you think about ...  Matt, wait, wait, wait.  This is something I've never heard of.  Right.  Now, where does this information come from?  You can go onto our website right now.  No, I believe you're ... I could go onto my website, and it will say that that didn't  happen.  No, no, no, no, you're misunderstanding what I'm saying.  Go onto our website, and you go to the evidence section, and you can move down to the first 
[02:51:00]  thing on Operation NORAD.  Operation NORAD.  It'll bring you directly to the article where we got our information.  And where did NORAD's war game information come from?  The internet.  It was released.  The internet.  It was released by who?  Who from NORAD?  Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, who ...  Cynthia McKinney.  Dude, yeah, that's a great fucking example of a person to bring up.  Dude, unfortunately, she's not a really good one right now.  Yeah, right now, credibility-wise. 
[02:51:30]  That woman is a kook.  She's kind of an ass.  I mean, you're going to be out there, I mean, in this kind of community, and for the things  that she's trying to get accomplished, you're going to be labeled as a kook.  I mean, look at Charlie Sheehan, who just came out and said, you know, that the attacks  of September 11th need to be reinvestigated.  World Trade Center Building 7 was definitely brought down by controlled demolition.  Okay.  And he's being attacked left and right.  We heard about that.  Sir, can I ask a question?  Sure.  We ran over this yesterday.  A controlled explosion in World Trade Center 7. 
[02:52:00]  How long would it take to set explosives?  I watched a lot of Discovery Channel.  I love watching the demolition shows and when they take down old buildings, what it takes  to wire a building to come down like that in a controlled demolition.  How do you take a working office building with people going in on a daily basis, working  their job, and wire it with enough C4 to bring it down in a controlled explosion without anybody  knowing you're carting in explosives, drilling holes in major beams, stretching wire under 
[02:52:30]  pressure to bring the building in?  This is all things that it takes to do a controlled explosion.  How do you do that with people working there every day?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  It's a very valid question.  You know, there's a lot of different ways.  I mean, you can have cabling upgrades.  You can have workers.  You can shut off security cameras.  No, no.  I understand.  All things that happened prior to September 11th.  And not only that, maybe I can refer you to the Manhattan Project.  When they built the A-bomb, they had 137,000 people work on that A-bomb and not one of them 
[02:53:00]  knew what they were doing.  They all lived in one spot.  They couldn't leave the compound.  There wasn't cell phones.  There were no video cameras.  There was no internet.  Those people were pretty much prisoners.  There's nothing, I mean, to think that what happened on September 11th is what the government  said is preposterous.  I just want to take one thing.  I'm taking that controlled explosion of World Trade Center 7. 
[02:53:30]  I was in construction for many years.  I've spent a lot of time in a lot of ceilings, on a lot of ladders.  When you bring in your tools, everyone knows what's going on.  I'm not going to say that it was easy.  It's not easy.  If you look at the collapse of that building, it is irrefutable.  It's irrefutable.  It is not irrefutable.  You can see the crest at the core of the summit.  Corey, hold on.  One thing at a time.  Dude.  Dude, you're going to be able to.  Corey, you're going to be able to get your points out.  Here's the problem with, like, what I find the problem with conspiracy guys is that it 
[02:54:00]  becomes an agenda-driven thing.  Now, what Ant is saying is a valid point.  Like, it is a, it's not, you can't just brush over it and go, well, you know, it must have  been hard.  What he is saying is a guy who's done construction.  Tell me.  Is that is a virtually, I mean, but you're going right back to, well, hey, if you believe  the government, that's crazy.  Okay.  That's agenda-driven.  What he is saying is a tangible thing.  How do you do that in working office buildings?  It's very simple, man.  I mean, it's not a complicated thing. 
[02:54:30]  It is so complicated.  There's something that they're not.  I mean, it's not complicated to get people into a building that they're not supposed to  be in.  Corey.  I mean, apparently, because they blew up the World Trade Center building in 1993.  I mean, they blew up-  Yeah, yeah.  A truck?  I mean, all these things, all these things happen with people getting into places that  they shouldn't have been with large bombs.  Oh, my God.  Why are we giving this time?  It's going to happen before.  What's the stop at this time?  We saw how that was done.  You just, dude, you're going fast.  You're not-  Like, the whole thing about the plane hitting the Pentagon, could it have evaporated? 
[02:55:00]  I thought that was a good point until I saw footage of a test they did with an airplane  hitting a nuclear reactor.  Like, they put a concrete to test what would happen if a plane hit a nuclear reactor.  Yeah.  Like, would that withstand a plane blast?  And they used, like, a military plane.  Granted, smaller than a 767-757.  And it basically evaporated when it hit the concrete wall that didn't have any give.  Like, you guys showed some interesting footage of planes that hit a Mountain Dew in 500 miles  an hour, which I thought was very interesting.  But there's give there because there's area for it to blow out. 
[02:55:30]  When it hits a brick wall or concrete like it did on this nuclear reactor, they showed  camera angles.  The plane evaporates.  It really vaporizes as it hits it.  Nothing.  Excuse me?  Nothing.  You didn't hear any of that?  He's got nothing.  Corey.  Corey.  Yes.  What about when I just asked you about the plane vaporizing hitting the Pentagon?  Holy shit.  Well, it's absolutely impossible. 
[02:56:00]  Titanium does not melt until 3,000 degrees, and jet fuel fires could have never caused that.  Okay.  What about the footage I just described to you that I've seen?  How impact will vaporize an aircraft if it's going fast enough into a brick wall?  I'd love to see the footage.  I mean, we have footage in the first edition where the plane goes directly into the wall  but then cuts through it and the wings separate.  No, no.  I'm talking about concrete.  Let's – can you send him a link right now?  We can send you a link to this footage.  It just – I'll repeat myself because you want to listen. 
[02:56:30]  It was a smaller plane.  It was a test they did on the nuclear – to see if a nuclear reactor would stand a plane  hitting it.  Small plane.  It's military footage.  The plane – it's not done by September 11th.  I think it's older footage.  It smashes into this concrete that's been specially built, and it basically vaporizes because  it has nowhere to go.  There's no give as opposed to a mountain where there's plenty of room for a plane to blow out.  And is this steel – is this steel-reinforced concrete?  I honestly don't know the type of concrete, but it was – I don't know, to be honest.  Whatever it was, it's probably similar to what they protect the Pentagon with. 
[02:57:00]  Can you give me the motivation behind the whole thing?  What's the motivation behind a government conspiracy to do this?  Absolutely.  The motivation is the ability to take over any nation that they'd like while taking away  liberties and freedoms from American citizens by passing the Patriot Act.  I mean, it literally eviscerates the Constitution.  So this was – that was the whole plan of action, like they're going to wire buildings  for explosions, set up missiles, I guess, into the Pentagon?  Well, I mean, that's speculation.  We never come out and say that it was a missile.  We just reflect that the hole is only 16 feet large. 
[02:57:30]  So how does the entire fuselage, wings, tail section of a plane disappear into this hole?  And you're saying that all this was done, planned out, and carried out on that day just  so the president could get the Patriot Act and take away some of our freedoms and invade  Iraq?  Well, Iraq's not the only thing.  I mean, they needed to go into Afghanistan first in order to build the oil pipeline.  I mean, anybody that knows –  Oh, so it's oil.  Well, oil's definitely a big part of the motivation. 
[02:58:00]  Oil's the motivation.  Well, the Project for a New American Century, if you read their document, Rebuilding America's  Defenses, where they call for a cataclysmic terrorist attack so that they can go into Eurasia,  clearly outline how they want to take over Eurasia.  Now, is that the stuff you guys talk about from the 60s with Lama?  No, that's Operation Northwoods.  The Rebuilding American Defenses is the PNAC document, the one where Cheney, Wolfowitz,  Rumsfeld, Quayle, Crystal, they're all a member of this think tank, Jeb Bush, and they  wrote this up before they were even in office. 
[02:58:30]  Here's my question for you.  This is a problem I have with what you're saying.  When you look at JFK's assassination, it was done in 1963, and even that – and I  do believe that was a conspiracy.  I don't believe the whole government was involved.  I think that's silly.  I do think it was obviously more than one shooter.  And even that was caught on video.  Even that raised questions.  And information was not passed around.  With the way information is passed around today, and the magnitude – and I don't  want to hear the bigger the lie, the more likely people are to believe it – you're 
[02:59:00]  talking about – I watched the video – landing planes, fake – getting actors to fake the  phone calls, because family members have heard these 911 calls where people say Arabs are  taking over the plane.  Where did those people go?  Where did those planes go?  All right, first off, we never claim that we know where the people are.  Well, okay, you don't claim that.  But you claim that they're gone somewhere.  What about the calls?  What's that?  What about the calls that says that there are –  Have you watched the movie?  Yes.  I haven't watched all of them.  I probably watched – I'd say 45 to 50 minutes of it. 
[02:59:30]  Okay, so then you didn't see the end where we deal with the cell phone calls.  No.  Basically, it's impossible to make a cell phone call from 32,000 feet.  In fact, United Airlines this year just put hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment.  They were in 32,000 feet.  Yes, some of these calls were supposed to be at 32,000 feet.  So when they were descending into the World Trade Center, they were pulling such high G-force maneuvers,  it would have been absolutely impossible for anybody to even be standing.  Okay, so you're saying basically that the family members who were saying that that was their relative on either A, the pilot, 
[03:00:00]  or B, the flight attendant are lying or they're actors?  No, I'm not saying they're lying at all.  We go over the voice morphing technology that's been around for years that could have easily used to fake their loved ones' voices.  Dude, you understand how this sounds like the amount of people it would take to do this?  Sir, they've only released one at all.  But isn't it more reasonable here, and isn't it possible and much more reasonable,  that Arab terrorists who hate us and our way of life for whatever reason 
[03:00:30]  decided to plan to crash planes into landmarks in this country and kill a lot of people?  Doesn't that make sense to you at all?  Absolutely not.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let me finish.  Okay, okay, absolutely not.  Guy, finish.  I'm not ignorant.  Go ahead.  I mean, obviously, I've studied these groups and seen whether it was possible or not.  There's definitely groups out there that hate us.  They just don't have the means.  Okay?  But it was kind of, I think more was proven that they did have the means and the ability, 
[03:01:00]  and they did do this, than any other concocted conspiracy.  They have a billionaire funding them, dude.  They have a billionaire terrorist funding them.  Actually, I have, I have, they hate these people.  The Keene Commission, the head of the commission, saying it would cost less than $500,000 to do.  Well, then there you go.  Don't make any difference.  So it's even cheaper.  All I'm saying is, it is so much more reasonable to believe that they hate us,  they want to crush our institutions, our landmarks, and kill our people, and through a lack of security, 
[03:01:30]  because we were, you know, fat cats sitting here, not really getting attacked on a huge scale,  they found a way to get us.  We were gotten by the enemy, not from within.  How did a 47-story skyscraper fall in on itself?  I've seen so many specials on how the steel structure melted, the weight of the cement.  Are you talking about World Trade Center Building 7?  Because I've never seen an explanation for it.  World Trade Center 7?  You know something?  Listen, I don't think there's ever been tests done where buildings and planes and shit are flying all over. 
[03:02:00]  I would like to believe that it fell down in the mess of two planes and two buildings.  And speaking of that, we got Kevin, he's a retired NYPD, on the phone.  He actually watched Tower 7 collapse.  Kevin, you're on with Corey Rowe.  Yeah, how you doing?  I'm a retired policeman.  I was stood there as we watched it collapse.  Does he know how it collapsed?  I want to ask him that.  Well, I've heard some of the officials...  No, you're wrong.  The building, number two, fell into it and took out the bottom section of it. 
[03:02:30]  And it stood sideways for three hours before it collapsed.  Stupid.  Don't tell me that somebody blew it up.  I watched it.  It burned for three hours before it collapsed.  Well, I'm sorry, but you're wrong.  No, I'm not wrong.  I watched it.  Stupid.  What do you mean I'm wrong?  I was there.  Before anything, you see the bombs go up and it fell on top of itself.  No steel building has ever done this before.  Corey, no steel building has ever done this.  No two planes ever crashed into a building next door.  I mean, there was damage to the building. 
[03:03:00]  The guy said he saw the bottom of the building taken out.  It burned for three hours and then it fell down.  We couldn't go in there for rescue because that building was tilted towards where the two buildings were.  We had to stand there and wait for it to collapse before we could do anything.  All right, stupid?  Yeah.  Well, it was so badly hurt.  But then how come Johnny had an emergency bunker there and he moved all his people there?  Please tell me.  I mean, I don't know.  How come all these people were smarter about getting out of the fire?  He hung up.  Corey, here's the thing. 
[03:03:30]  This is what I'm talking about with not facing tangible things.  This is a guy who is a retired cop who was there and said, look, I saw the bottom of the building because this other building, one of the towers fell into it.  And you're going, no, that's impossible.  It is impossible, sir.  I'm sorry, but it is totally impossible.  How can you say it's impossible?  He was right up against the World Trade Center that stood with light damage.  Okay, so you're saying that he's lying.  No, I'm not saying he's lying.  I'm saying he's misinformed.  But he's one of many eyewitnesses, police officers, people, eyewitnesses that were there that saw this and you are saying it's impossible that didn't happen. 
[03:04:00]  Absolutely.  I have NYPD members on interviews that I've done that were right outside World Trade Center 7.  Less than a year ago, I talked to a guy who had to duck behind a van to save his own life, and he had major questions about it.  Sir, can I ask you this?  Why would they blow that building up anyway?  Why would they go through the trouble and risk of blowing that building up when it's really kind of a side thing when you take down the two World Trade Center towers with airplanes? 
[03:04:30]  The World Trade Center 7, why go through the trouble and risk of finding explosives in there when if it didn't fall down, this would still be just as tragic an event?  And I have a kind of a tag to that question.  If you're going to go after the towers to make whatever statement Bush wanted to make according to you or whoever wanted to make it, why not just rig the basement with bombs like you're saying they did and then fake a truck bomb coming in? 
[03:05:00]  That's a much simpler, much more manageable operation.  Fake a truck bomb taking out a bottom corner of each building.  They collapse into each other, which is originally the 93 bombing plan.  And if you know anything about the 93 bombing plan, that was an inside job, too.  The New York Post reported that the FBI had hired an Egyptian army officer to infiltrate Muslims that hate us.  Wow.  It's absolutely true.  I'm not the one reporting this.  No, I know.  You really have an anti-government agenda, which is fine.  A lot of people do. 
[03:05:30]  It was the official version of hook, line, and sinker in the beginning.  Dude.  It wasn't until before the Iraq war and I started to actually take a look at it that I realized that there was something very wrong with the official story.  And I'm not saying that there aren't things in the official story I'd like to see explained.  But what I'm talking about, this is what, again, this is what tells me it's more of a rebellion against kind of like, you know, mommy and daddy type of an attitude.  Is that when tangible evidence, this is what it is.  That's ridiculous, man.  I love my parents.  It has nothing to do with rebellion.  I'm kind of being symbolic.  It has to do with survival, sir.  Yeah, I'm sure it does.  You just laughed at me when I was telling you the facts about the 93 World Trade Center bombing when you can't tell me one person who was involved. 
[03:06:00]  You're talking about, I don't know.  You're talking, you said to me, why didn't they use truck bombs in the basement to collapse them into each other?  And you're saying, and you're quoting, dude, dude, quote.  They carried that plan out.  You're quoting the New York Post as your big, I think.  No, not the New York Post, sir.  New York Times and Washington Post.  Oh, well, they don't have an agenda, the New York Times.  They're not left-leaning.  Hey, by the way, did you quote the New York Times?  Was it a Jason Blair article that you're quoting?  Absolutely not.  Listen, hold on, dude.  Or was it on the payroll?  Or did you quote the New York Times? 
[03:06:30]  I'm talking on the payroll all the time.  Jason Blair's just.  How about the New York Times article recently where they named the guy that was in that hood, and they had to come back the next day and go, oh, we don't know what we're talking about.  Is that the New York Times article you're talking about?  Absolutely not.  Oh, okay.  But I'm just saying the New York Times, don't quote them because they're a big-name paper and all of a sudden that makes it.  Well, who am I supposed to quote?  We're just going through the mainstream media reports, the mainstream media video, the mainstream media photographs that contradict the official version.  You just had.  We're just asking the question.  Dude, you just had a cop who saw the building collapse, and you're saying he's wrong. 
[03:07:00]  He is wrong.  I don't know what to tell you, but a 47-story skyscraper, no matter how long it burns.  Of course you don't know what to tell me.  It's not going to collapse from the bottom up.  It is scientifically impossible.  Unless a piece of a huge 100-story building hits it on the bottom, then perhaps it can fall from the bottom.  It didn't hit it on the bottom.  That thing was pulverized concrete.  If you watch the video, we isolate the black points going off 20, 30, and 60 floors below.  Pulverized concrete.  Did you see the top part of it kind of lean over and not pulverized until it hit the ground? 
[03:07:30]  If it had just collapsed, it would have fallen onto the ground, onto the buildings next to it,  but somehow it magically exploded upwards as the bottom exploded and went down.  Although you're exactly right.  It was at a 90-degree angle.  That's because that's where the plane hit it.  It wasn't a 90-degree angle.  What happened?  No, not at all.  At the crash point.  And then it just blows up from the impact point up.  Dude, at the crash point where the fire was, that's where the collapse started.  There were many floors above it.  So as it collapsed, the floors above it didn't collapse on themselves until it hit the ground and the building next to it. 
[03:08:00]  That is absolutely a lie.  The thing is leaning over.  It should have fallen over.  I've seen other buildings.  It shouldn't have fallen over.  Don't you know physics?  Yeah, I do know the physics, actually.  Yeah, the second...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  The second the top of that building started tipping over, right?  If the floors below it didn't start giving, it would have toppled over sideways.  The second the floors below it start giving, it loses its pivot point and comes straight down. 
[03:08:30]  And I suppose that it's just a coincidence that the firefighters got into the building that got hit second,  got into the impact hole on the floor, radioed down to the guys that they could knock it down with two lines,  and then two minutes later it was demolished.  What do you think?  Did they hurt?  Do you think that they were monitoring the calls from the NYPD and the fire department?  And they said, blow the World Trade Center, they're going to put this fire out.  When they got up there and they said, we're going to be able to put these fires out,  you realize they're claiming that it was 3,000 degrees up there. 
[03:09:00]  There's no way a human being could have survived.  I think it's...  I mean, look, dude, I understand.  I understand.  Look, I'm not saying you don't love your parents.  You're 22.  And I mean, I know it's a young age and it's a time of rebellion.  It's got nothing to do with the time of rebellion, sir.  It does.  It has to do with the hardcore facts.  No, no, I do understand that the government's bad man and they do represent parental, you know...  That's, again, ridiculous.  It's not.  I mean, what part of you guys?  No.  What's that, sweetie?  Are you a party?  Are you affiliated with the Republican Party?  No.  See, that's the problem. 
[03:09:30]  I'm not being...  I am affiliated with being a human being that has some intellect.  I don't take one side on either issue.  Really?  Oh, wow.  It's a hero to me.  Listen, we got Paul from New York.  Paul, hold on, sweetie.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Paul.  Yeah, I was a pilot with U.S. Airways.  We were flying from Baltimore to LaGuardia.  And we were over Staten Island when we saw the second airplane hit.  And to see the fire and everything that came out of that building as we flew right past it on our way into LaGuardia, that building had to collapse on itself from the intense heat and jet fuel that was burning. 
[03:10:00]  There's no way that could have been a controlled demolition from the fire and everything that was there.  It came down on its own.  There's just no way that that could have happened.  And to address the cell phone issue, as a pilot, I've had my cell phone left on in the airplane, and it will get a signal from 30,000 feet.  I mean, that's crazy that that could have all been fabricated.  There's no way.  Yeah, you're talking about a conspiracy so huge involving so many people, involving people that disappeared, planes that disappeared. 
[03:10:30]  Where'd they go?  And all the people – and I don't doubt – I'm sorry to interrupt you.  I don't doubt that the government has scumbag elements in it at all.  But the magnitude you're talking about –  Beyond X-Files shit.  The biggest thing that's ever happened to our country, or at least in the last 60 years, that nobody would come forward and say, yes, I was a pilot who landed the plane, or I was involved with murdering the passengers,  or I was one of the actors that did this, or I did that.  Not one.  You're only going –  First of all, never do we say anything about actors.  I'm assuming who else would do this call. 
[03:11:00]  Again, you're assuming all this stuff, and you've done no research.  Listen, for everybody out there that's listening, please go to video.google.com and watch Loose Chain 2nd Edition for free and decide for yourself.  Because 99% of the people that watch the movie agree with me afterwards.  Yeah, 99% of the people –  Absolutely.  I do screenings all the time, man.  I understand.  Are they also looking at the other information?  Do they look at both sides?  They've got the other information.  These people believe the official version, hook, line, and sinker before they come in.  No, not many people are informed. 
[03:11:30]  Not many people – you know why?  Let me tell you something.  You people are very smart.  You're able to wrap all this shit up in one package and feed it to people.  In order to get what you call the official story, you have to go to a lot of different sources and do your own research and be educated and read books and maybe specials, Discovery Channel, The Learning Channel.  Where is the evidence that these 19 guys did it?  Where is it?  Where is the evidence?  Yeah, please name me one thing that proves these guys didn't. 
[03:12:00]  Name you one –  No, you guys are defending the official version to the end.  How about the evidence that they have of them going through the screening process at the airport?  The two videos that are very grainy?  How about – yeah, that.  I couldn't tell it was Mohammed Atta.  How about the flight lessons?  How about the – how about the flight lessons?  How about the flight lessons they took where they didn't know – want to know how to take the planes off, they just needed to know how to fly them?  Two of them listed their home address at the Pensacola Navy Station.  It was reported by Newsweek. 
[03:12:30]  Yes, so they were – our security sucked ass.  I'll agree with you there.  But the fact of the matter is these animals trained how to fly jet planes, got on the planes, took them over, and crashed them.  And that's why they're not on any of the passengers' lists.  They're not on any of the morgue lists.  Well, they're not on any of the – they're not on any of the – I've read the official passengers' lists.  Oh, my God.  You've read the faked fucking – I've seen them online – passenger lists.  What do you want them on, the memorial, too? 
[03:13:00]  I've done my research.  You can't back up anything.  I can back up – you know something?  You can't back it up.  I mean, you can't tell me.  You're hysterical.  You can tell me that they were on the list of passengers.  And I'm telling you, I've read the documents.  They are not.  You know what you're doing?  If it was raining outside and I said, look, it's raining, you would say, back it up.  It's fucking raining.  It's obvious.  You just said to me that the hijackers were on the list.  They're not.  I've read the documents.  You haven't.  And then you're –  Dude, they had tickets.  Whatever I'm saying is the fact that our security was awful back then as far as flying went. 
[03:13:30]  It allowed these animals to get on these planes and crash them.  That's what happened.  All right, listen, listen, listen.  You know what G-Force is?  Listen, listen, Corey.  We could go on forever.  We got – I mean, the phones have exploded.  We do have some people, believe it or not, that agree with you.  Absolutely.  And by the way, humans will take more G-Force than one of those fucking planes would take.  So the plane would have ripped –  You can fly a plane like that?  The plane would have ripped apart – 
[03:14:00]  With the G-Force, do you know what manually you can fly the plane at?  Does anybody know?  Dude, at that low altitude, the plane was ready to rip apart at about 500 miles an hour.  But if it's flying in a straight fucking line, what G-Forces are you getting?  No, maximum they can do 1.5 Gs.  They weren't flying in the street.  1.5 Gs?  Wait a minute.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Dude, are you telling me a 767 can do 1.5 Gs maximum?  No, it can do 1.5 Gs maximum manually. 
[03:14:30]  It can do much more –  You're fucking insane.  No, absolutely not.  You're insane.  That's in the American Airlines family.  All right.  Listen, listen.  We got a lot of people that want in on this conversation.  Let's get Steve from Yellowstone.  Steve, what's going on today?  Hi.  May I speak to Corey, please?  Yeah, Corey's on the line with you, Steve.  Corey, I can't hear you.  Is this you?  Yes.  I think that the problem is a lot of people get very emotional about the issue,  and it feels kind of like you're being ganged up on here because you're expressing an unpopular view.  And I've never been a big supporter of the – like, my website has, like, certain conspiracy things on it. 
[03:15:00]  I don't know if it's right or wrong, but I think that you are being ganged up on.  And I wanted to know why is it they're questioning your patriotism and your motives  when you're just trying to report what happened.  Oh, very good.  Well, I don't think they're questioning my patriotism.  I just think –  Ramon!  Mohammed Atta should fly a plane into Corey's mother's cunt.  Ramon!  Oswald was flying United Flight 93. 
[03:15:30]  Ramon!  And Wood makes Corey –  I fucked that one up!  Ramon!  Corey makes Ed Wood look like Orson Welles!  Ramon!  Corey left the Army because he got caught sucking cock like the Biloxi Blues!  Ramon!  Get this spoiled 22-year-old college boy suck it off the line!  Oh, Jesus.  You know, that's just utterly ridiculous, guys. 
[03:16:00]  Wow.  Yeah, seriously.  I mean, you know, I'll sit here and go at it all day because you guys don't have any facts to back up anything.  I want to apologize for Steve from Yellowstone.  My goodness.  I want to apologize for Steve from Yellowstone.  Obviously, we got past our screeners.  My goodness.  Yeah.  That's horrible.  Yeah, I'm sure you guys are heartbroken over there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Corey, good luck to you and your movie. 
[03:16:30]  Good luck to you guys.  I really hope you open your eyes and figure out that, you know, you're not being –  My eyes are so wide open.  No, it's really true.  I mean, I feel bad for that.  How close are you to catching Bigfoot, by the way?  Hey, I'm –  Hey, you know what I'm talking about?  You're going to be fine.  You know, the truth comes out.  Yeah, we're all just puppets, Corey.  You're the wise one.  You know it all.  Hold on.  Obviously –  Hold on.  All right.  If you want to go –  Corey, shut up.  If you want to go serious, Fatso from Wackbag has a very good question.  Fatso.  Yeah, sure.  I'm being fucking serious, douchebag.  Well, I'm –  Fatso, go ahead. 
[03:17:00]  Hey, Corey, you're a fucking kook, man.  Listen, if the government was involved in a conspiracy of 9-11, and just so they could  have an excuse to invade Iraq, why wouldn't they go through the trouble of going ahead  and planning the so-called weapons of mass destruction that they were searching for,  just so they don't look like fucking asses?  You're fucking –  That's a good question.  Why not do it on foreign soil?  You know, why wouldn't that work? 
[03:17:30]  Why not bomb an embassy?  Why not bomb something where –  They have bombed embassies, man.  You guys just don't know your history.  Oh, hold on.  You're talking –  Wait, what –  Don't tell me.  The Marine barracks, Libya, are inside job?  I was going to say the court was awfully suspicious because they blamed bin Laden,  and then they gave bin Laden construction the bid to put it back together.  Why can't you accept –  Why can't you accept the notion that there are people of the Muslim faith, Arabs,  that hate us and our way of life and want us dead? 
[03:18:00]  Why can't –  Listen, there are low-level Muslims all over that hate our way of life.  Low-level?  No, what about high-level that have the potential –  What about high-level?  The potential –  You know, it's been Osama bin Laden.  Why is it Le Figaro, the biggest paper in France,  and then CBS both reported the guy was getting kidney dialysis on a U.S. base in Dubai?  I'm not the one saying that.  If this guy is so dangerous, why is he getting kidney dialysis from our armed forces?  Yeah, we heard about the kidney dialysis story.  Another piece of crap.  Uh-huh. 
[03:18:30]  It's just – it's not facts.  Why are the media reporting it once or twice and never refuting it?  Please tell me.  The media reports a lot of shit.  The media is awful.  They're sensationalist, knee-jerk idiots that are trying to top one another.  So if they get a report from Al Jazeera, they'll report it as news.  Actually, that was reported by the people that worked in the hospital.  But when you sort out the fact from fiction,  it comes down to guys that couldn't stand our way of life, 
[03:19:00]  who want us dead and want our landmarks.  You've done no research.  Yes, I have.  I know how the World Trade Center came down.  You don't.  Listen, sir, I'm asking, what makes you think – you told me a couple of blurry videos.  Yeah.  And then you said that they were on the passengers list, and they're not.  I said they got tickets on the plane because they were on the fucking plane.  Actually, you know, that's way under debate because they're not listed on any of the flights.  I'm not the one not listing them. 
[03:19:30]  I have more proof that they were on the plane than you have that they don't, sir.  You have no proof.  I have proof.  I saw Mohammed Atta at a gate.  Listen, these people took flight lessons.  The same fucking people.  I have more proof than you do that they weren't on the plane.  Listen, we're running out of show, and – hold on, Corey.  We're running out of show, and you got everyone reacting.  We got another person that wants in on this conversation.  All right.  Let's say hi to Poe in New Jersey.  Poe in Jersey.  Poe.  Poe, you're the last call.  We got to move on here.  Gentlemen. 
[03:20:00]  Hey, Poe.  All right.  I wanted to know – the problem I had with the official story was that the – I don't know if I believe in a controlled demolition,  but I do know that there were no marks on the front of the Pentagon lawn, and I found that to be disturbing,  because how does the official government story explain the fact that there are no marks on the Pentagon lawn with allegedly a plane coming in?  That's the problem I have with the government story.  All right.  We got anything on that?  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, originally the –  Ramon!  Ben snorts coke in front of the Pentagon! 
[03:20:30]  Ramon!  Ben Laden has the same disease as Mabel King!  Ben Laden!  Corey is a girl's name!  Ramon!  Master Poe wants free food on American Airlines flight!  Ramon!  Bigfoot was flying the planes!  Ramon!  The passengers are hiding with the Jews who vets the Holocaust!  I mean, Holocaust where I put a C there, because I hate Corey, and I hope he dies of AIDS! 
[03:21:00]  Jesus.  Wow.  Well, once again, our screener's doing a great job.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Assholes.  Anyway, like I just said –  I've got to apologize.  This thing slid in –  All right, Corey.  Corey.  Are you going to let me answer the question the guy asked it?  Corey.  I wouldn't even let you try to work that question out, because that guy that was calling was an idiot.  How about –  Corey, shut up for a second.  We've been having a lot of fun with you, obviously, but we've got some facts out there. 
[03:21:30]  So we'll give you the final word, like Bill O'Reilly does.  To sum up, what would you like to say?  I'd like to say that everybody listening out there that thinks I'm a jerk-off or a jackass –  That he is –  I can't believe how many flubs Steve had.  Yeah, Steve can't talk anymore.  Steve just couldn't wait to hammer him.  All right, listen.  Oh, my God.  The thought that you, for a split second, even entertained anything on that video. 
[03:22:00]  I want to smack that goddamn Breathe Right strip off your nose.  As the rule is, when you watch it, you'll see there were a couple of valid points raised.  What happens is, guys like that always sink their own fucking ship because they're agenda-driven and dishonest.  That's the problem.  All right, listen.  I just got a sign that said – a note that said, dangerously – dangerously behind on breaks.  Oh, no.  So why don't we step aside and we'll finish the program next. 
[03:22:30]  Can you say fuck on this channel?  Oh, Jesus.  That's shocking.  Holy fuck, I need coffee.  This is the best show ever.  The OVM show.  April 8th.  Our favorite – damn it.  To you, the U2 Tribute Band.  On April 8th in Orangeburg, New York.  That is one entertainment hub.  Orangeburg, New York.  Chubby McGuire's. 
[03:23:00]  It sounds like a comedy club.  We're not comedians, damn it.  Chubby McGuire's in Orangeburg, New York.  325, Route 303.  Route 303 in Orangeburg.  845-365-1900.  That's 845-365-1900.  Further information, hit www.notyou2.com. 
[03:23:30]  We're back with the OVM Anthony program.  Groovy little tune.  What is this?  I don't know.  Red Hot Chili Peppers.  It is?  I've grown to hate them.  I want to thank Dr. Steve for sending a package.  You never know what you're going to get when you get a Dr. Steve package.  Yeah.  It was like a press pass thing or a backstage pass.  I usually like to open up the Dr. Steve packages in the middle of Central Park where I know no one will be anywhere near me because you never know what the fuck that psycho is going to send you. 
[03:24:00]  It's like a secret agent.  Microfilm.  He gave me an all-access pass for an old Nirvana Red Hot Chili Peppers and, I think, Girl Jam show.  Nice.  Pretty cool.  Very cool of you, Steve.  Thank you.  Vaughn, girl, Arkansas.  You're on the radio with us.  Hi.  Hi, guys.  I just want you to know that I am so thrilled you are home from vacation.  Well, we're not. 
[03:24:30]  I was having a grand old time.  I live and breathe, y'all, so I get up at 5 a.m. to listen to it.  Here, Central Time, you keep me laughing.  You keep me smiling.  I listen to you morning, afternoon, and evening.  Do you?  And this is out there for Corey, that dumb motherfucker.  Yeah.  His stupidity was painful.  That guy would be screaming for his precious little mommy.  Very good.  Here's what he is.  He's just a child who wants to mean something. 
[03:25:00]  He's just a little fellow who realizes that his opinion isn't very valid and no one really cares about him.  And now he's going to be the guy that leads the charge.  He wants to be important and make a mark in this world.  I want to make a mark.  I uncovered something.  Look at what I found.  It's because of you, Corey.  We know because of you.  Yeah.  Yuck.  Woodward, Bernstein, and Corey.  What a douche.  Going to uncover it.  All right, Vaughn.  He's just a complete...  I said, all right, Vaughn.  He's just a...  He's just a...  I said, all right, Vaughn.  No, I have to...  Well, you had the really one good point where you said if pain was... 
[03:25:30]  The fact that you kind of like said if stupidity was pain, then you had to come up with a pain one,  and he'd be screaming in more agony.  Right.  That example was awful.  Vaughn.  He needs to get off his mommy's tit and grow the fuck up.  If good examples were pain, I would shove the phone up your cunt.  Hey, hey, hey.  We like Vaughn.  Leave her alone.  Leave her alone.  Leave her alone.  I'm sorry.  She's a fan.  I'm sorry, Vaughn.  We're starting to get actual female listeners.  Thank you, Vaughn.  Let's keep it going.  I'm sorry, Vaughn.  Thank you for calling, and don't listen to little John Norton as they're plugging him. 
[03:26:00]  I love Jimmy Norton.  I love you too, Vaughn.  Ben, I hope he does kick in the car.  I love your supermarkets in L.A. too.  Thanks a lot, Vaughn.  Thank you, guys.  Oh, look at that.  Nice L.A. reference.  I might have to go next week and film Sizzunthin'.  Hey, Brooklyn Ace from Pal Talk.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Sugar Bear.  This guy was such a fucking idiot.  I would have loved to have asked him what the fuck happened to my uncle who died in the  trade center. 
[03:26:30]  It didn't happen.  It was a controlled explosion.  Fuck you, you scumbag.  They're all walking around somewhere.  I like the fact that the cop called and was just going, look, stupid.  I was there, stupid.  I was there, stupid.  I saw it, stupid.  The guy, here's what they do.  We talked about this a little on break.  They, all the burden of proof is put on the people that already have proven what happened.  So he'll like ask you, the douchebag will say like, oh, well, give me proof that that  happened.  There is proof. 
[03:27:00]  The proof is the planes went into the building.  They never have the proof.  He always asks you, oh, I have done my research.  Oh, have you?  Really?  You know how the building came down?  You know what it is?  He's 22.  Yeah.  He just wants to.  He didn't do any fucking research.  Anthony, you had him.  Dude, he just.  You had him dead to right and he's being a fucking douchebag about it.  Dude, he wants to show everyone.  I'll show you.  Show ya.  I'll show you, guys.  I'll show ya.  I'll show ya. 
[03:27:30]  I'm the voice of a generation.  Yeah.  Then who did it?  Who, who?  Who, who?  All right.  Thank you, bro.  The only thing he showed was that he was a douchebag.  Have a good day, guys.  All right.  I can't believe there are still people that think like that out there.  Hi, Mars.  Hey, let's try to leave it a funny.  All right.  I'd like to first ask Mars when Tiberius Caesar cut his hair.  All right.  Sorry.  He's, he's a trained killer too, or you know his?  No, it's Caligula.  All right. 
[03:28:00]  You should be fisting a married guy.  Do what I do and just go after the easy targets.  Ordering some lard.  All right, let's.  Yes, some funny.  Yeah, let's try the funny.  It's an FU line we do.  Uh-huh.  I don't know the number.  I don't even know.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Maybe they could pad data it right now for us.  Who's the fucking creep outside the studio?  Jesus.  He's perhaps a guest for the Ron and Fez show.  Yeah, is he?  Why would you call him a creep?  I don't know.  Why don't you call him to his face?  He looks like a writer.  He looks like a writer for some kind of rock magazine. 
[03:28:30]  That's what I'd place him as.  Wait, get him in here.  What is he?  Bring him in.  No one talked to him.  No one talked to him.  All right, here he comes.  So, um.  All right, we're going to play what the call is from where?  I don't even know what this was.  I can't.  I'm looking.  Yeah.  For what we were going to do.  You got to play the calls from the drunk guys from. 
[03:29:00]  From what?  Hmm.  The FU line.  All right.  That's what we were doing.  Okay, okay.  We have the FU line.  Did we get the number up on the pad?  What number?  The FU line number.  What number?  I'm just looking at the camera here on my pal talk.  It's hysterical.  Wow.  She is hot.  Who is that one of the top right?  She's very attractive. 
[03:29:30]  Top right.  Dynamite.  And baby girl's finally in.  You're late.  You're late.  Yeah.  That guy was irritating.  My throat hurts.  Absolutely.  Oh, my goodness.  Ah!  Who are you?  They told me to come in here.  Who told you to come in here?  I don't know.  Well, who?  Who?  What show are you here for?  Ron and Fez.  Oh, this is the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Sorry.  Your guys told me to come in.  Well, no, our guys couldn't.  It wasn't our guys.  Was it one of our guys?  I apologize.  Was it one of our guys or one of their guys?  Which one? 
[03:30:00]  Point them out.  They set me up there.  Point them out.  I'll go find them and bring them back.  What's the Ron and Fez thing you're doing?  I'm just old friends.  We don't care.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll point them out to you, though.  Yeah, if you could.  What's your name?  I'm the other Laszlo.  Oh!  Cute.  Beat it.  All right.  Laszlo.  All right.  Cool.  Not your Laszlo.  No, no, no.  We have the other show, bro.  Be good.  What are you going to do for the show?  Do you do the...  Cool.  That's cool.  What are you going to do for the show?  I'm just mainly...  I'm here for 24 hours.  Dude, we're going to miss that.  You still on?  You want me to stay? 
[03:30:30]  No.  No.  Get the...  Here, here, here.  No, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding, of course.  What are you...  Point out who did the...  Point out which guy...  Wait, Laszlo.  Point out who it was.  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  You?  That was the funniest fucking thing I ever saw. 
[03:31:00]  And while you're out there, trim that beard, shit dick.  You start trying to point out a guy, I just slam the door to his face.  That was such a good thud.  Wow.  Awkward.  They told me to come in here.  Who?  Aw, I'm sorry.  He's ratting him out.  Aw, that's funny. 
[03:31:30]  That was a damn good one.  God damn, is that funny.  That was obviously more of a visual than a radio bit.  A bearded gentleman came in and sat down, and we were just kind of quietly ignoring him,  and it was really uncomfortable for him and us.  Yeah.  Very funny.  And then Ope jumped, and he jumped.  When you went, ah, he went, he jumped.  Yeah.  Aw, god damn.  Show him the door, because I was really curious to see who would force him to come in here.  He tries to point someone out and slam.  Anyway.  Good.  Well, we're going to have to save the funny for tomorrow. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, well, that was good enough for me.  Now, Worry Row was the guy who was on.  K-O-R-E-Y-R-O-R-O-W-E.  So maybe you know who he is.  Let's say hi to Dead Bent.  We've got a couple seconds here.  Dead Bent, uh, Dead Bent.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Jimmy was screaming wah-wah penis because he was too young to pronounce want.  Nice.  No.  Thank you for picking up on that.  Chris and Buffalo, real fast.  Yeah, Ramon's a mush-mouth douche that can't verbally abuse a 22-year-old fan with an opinion. 
[03:32:30]  No need to hurt me.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
