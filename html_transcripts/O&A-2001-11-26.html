<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts recounting their return from a break and announcing an upcoming Boston show.  A graphic description of homemade pornography sent by a Boston friend dominated a significant portion of the early show. The hosts detailed the video's explicit content, comparing its viewing to a simultaneous viewing of a Mick Jagger documentary, resulting in humorous juxtapositions and comments from the staff.  A listener then called in, expressing interest in making his own pornographic video.  Opie then shifted to a discussion of his Thanksgiving experience, sharing anecdotes about his family, including alleged Mafia connections and their criminal activities.

The conversation transitioned to video games, covering titles such as *Harry Potter*, *Monsters, Inc.*, *Grand Theft Auto 3*, *Silent Hill 2*, and *Mystique*.  Callers shared their gaming experiences, particularly a caller's unsettling interaction with the interactive elements of *Mystique*. The hosts discussed their own gaming history, including frustrations with Sega's failed consoles. This segment ended with calls to the "FU Line" and a mention of upcoming guests Charles Nelson Riley and Kreskin.

The show continued with a discussion about disappointing childhood Christmas gifts, prompting listener calls sharing similar experiences.  A humorous exchange with a stoned caller, Jillian from Long Island, followed.  A heated discussion ensued regarding the station airing commercials for a competing satellite radio service.  Opie and Anthony vehemently expressed their anger, repeatedly calling program director Ken Stevens to demand explanations, which were met with further frustration and offensive remarks from the hosts.  Callers also chimed in on the absurdity of the situation. The hosts also discussed the underwhelming entries for their "Mommy, What Would You Do for Britney Spears Tickets?" contest.  This segment included further banter about childhood toys, video game consoles, and personal anecdotes.

Kreskin, the mentalist, then joined the show as a guest. The segment primarily focused on demonstrations of Kreskin's abilities.  One demonstration involved Anthony selecting an item from a box, culminating in a watch â€“ the item Kreskin had predicted earlier.  Another involved a caller, Lillian, identifying the Jack of Spades while looking at the sky, which Kreskin then produced from his previously unattended briefcase.  The hosts and others speculated on the methods, suggesting sleight of hand or planted participants.  The segment included tangents, listener calls, discussions of Kreskin's book, off-color jokes, and a proposed "taint-off."  The segment concluded with the F.U. line and promotional announcements; staff member Rick was mentioned as being involved in Kreskin's setup.

A final segment focused on another of Kreskin's magic tricks. A listener picked the Jack of Spades; Opie retrieved a briefcase from a garbage pail containing a deck missing the Jack of Spades, which was then found in Kreskin's pocket.  The hosts and callers debated how the trick was performed, theorizing about planted participants, including the possibility that Lillian was a plant, and multiple decks of cards. The discussion included various tangents, humorous listener call-ins, jokes about Anthony's family and satellite radio. One caller mentioned STP being in the studio.  The segment concluded with ticket giveaways and a promotion for a future show segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program!  The well-rested Opie and Anthony program.  I feel like we've been off for about a month, Anthony.  Isn't that good?  It's very good. We needed the rest.  I'm invigorated.  A couple phone numbers to give out before we get started.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Boston, Massachusetts.  Boston.  We're going to be in Boston in the very near future. 
[00:00:30]  We'll have details as the week progresses.  How's that, okay?  But if you're in Boston or anywhere else in America, that gets this fine radio show.  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  How are you doing, Anthony?  Very good.  I'm, like I said, rested.  I also want to thank Boston because there's an old friend up there that's been sending us some homemade porno.  Yeah, what's up with that stuff?  He just sends us tapes and tapes of homemade porno. 
[00:01:00]  Is it him or is it someone else and he sends them?  I think he has a website or some kind of underground company and basically he gets couples to have sex on film.  Yeah.  Or on videotape and they send it into this guy and then he kind of distributes it.  Yeah, that's kind of what I thought.  I didn't think it was him.  But it is just kind of regular couples on one of those binges where they just are effing for hours on end.  Just so much better than, you know, the porno that's out today. 
[00:01:30]  I don't like the storyline porno.  I don't like the fake girl pornos.  You know, the stripper-like fake boob pornos.  This is just two pretty ragged around the edges people just pounding each other in bed.  It's so much hotter.  And in the backyard, he had one of those night shot cameras.  Yeah.  It almost looked like they were having sex in Afghanistan.  Yeah.  And the quality was like the video phones.  I must say, he was using a bunker buster.  Yeah, he had the bunker buster out and he was slamming that bunker. 
[00:02:00]  You know, sometimes they hide pretty deep.  You've got to weed them out.  Hell, I know it looks like Osama would have been lying down there sometimes, but it wasn't Osama.  You've got to, like the president said, smoke them out and get them running.  Well, he was doing his best.  Bring it to justice.  She was running all over the backyard, falling down.  He bent her over a chair and it was hysterical.  She had to grab on with both hands or he'd have pushed her over.  He just pushed her right over.  Classic, though.  So it is pretty good and it beats the regular porno. 
[00:02:30]  The only thing wrong is it is on videotape.  It should be on...  It's okay.  Because that adds to it.  I mean, she...  Oh, I should be on DVD.  She had some problems.  He had some problems.  At one point, I think he dumped some of his beer there.  He did.  To use it as some form of...  Yeah, he did.  He did.  Yeah.  You can figure out what the beer was used for.  Yes.  That's great.  It was obvious.  It was too just drunken slob.  Yeah.  It looked like it was a summer pool party and everyone else finally went home at like 3.34 in  the morning and they got down to some business. 
[00:03:00]  They were doing it out back and then they went inside into the bed and started pounding  there and it was great.  And then we turned the sound off for a little while.  Well, there was some...  We had the sound off because we were listening to...  We were watching something.  Yeah.  No, no.  This...  Yeah, I got to explain.  We have two TVs in our office.  So the left TV had the homemade porno that the guy from Massachusetts sent us.  And on the right side was the documentary on Mick Jagger that's been all over the TV lately.  And it's so funny.  It moves into what in the office?  Stinky?  Stinky was into both TVs. 
[00:03:30]  He was going back and forth.  Ben, without a doubt, was focused on the whole Mick Jagger documentary.  I saw that.  And the rest of the office was focused on the homemade porno.  And you're just assuming as you're watching the porno that everyone else is watching the porno.  And Ben would just blurt out stuff like,  Hey, I didn't know...  Oh, wait.  This is Miami.  This is Miami.  I'm like, how can you tell?  It's a backyard in the middle of nowhere.  It's like, wait a minute.  They're slamming.  What did he see?  A palm tree or something?  Right.  And they're always watching the other thing. 
[00:04:00]  They're always watching the Mick Jagger.  And then what's even worse, the sound's down on the porno, up on the Mick Jagger thing.  And some woman is just being a hell of a gal to this gentleman that's sitting down.  And all you hear is Mick's young daughter talking.  About daddy.  Yeah, it was wrong.  It was really, really disturbing.  And quite entertaining at the same time.  And then you hear Lenny Kravitz, I like my chicken fried. 
[00:04:30]  I don't know, Lenny was in the porno?  What, is he making a little breakfast for the gang?  Very good pornography.  We always like good porno.  And I could tell it was good porno just for the fact that Steve C., who is a porno connoisseur.  I call him an aficionado.  An aficionado.  Is he on the cover of Porno Aficionado magazine?  Big dildo, yeah.  Puffing on a big dildo.  He's got a big C in his mouth and we're not talking cigar.  And he came in to remind us about some production. 
[00:05:00]  Usually he darts right back out and gets right back to work in production.  Yeah.  No, he pulled up a chair and he had to watch the festivities.  27 minutes.  27 minutes.  We saw a 27-minute Hummer going down.  It was just ponderous.  Effing ponderous.  We threw that one out.  That's when we were convinced that the guy sending us the porno was actually gay.  Yeah.  27 minutes.  The girl's fully dressed.  I know.  And she had those huge knackers that she should have pulled out. 
[00:05:30]  But no, we got to see his junk.  We got to see her licking balloon knots.  Everyone just did a collective, ah, ah, right when she started doing that.  Like she's nuzzling the yam bag.  And you're like, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  All right, be careful.  Because that could hurt, ladies.  You got to be, like, good with that.  You got to know.  And she's nuzzling, nuzzling.  She's tongue, nuzzle, nuzzle.  No!  No!  No!  No!  Oh, no!  God.  Oh, boy. 
[00:06:00]  That'll leave a bruise.  Hey, at one point, it looks like she was smothering Jay Leno.  Because all you could see is her chin.  Well, it looked like a chin.  Hey, get me out of the window.  But it was something else.  Well, you know, it's a wonderful being here today.  It's a little, little, little, little.  The only thing you could see is this thing that looked like a Jay Leno chin.  Tonight on the show is going to be a great thing.  Brooke.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Tommy, first call to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:06:30]  We're live.  What's up, bro?  Hey, what's up there, brother man?  Hey.  You're a tough guy.  What's up?  Hi.  I'm loving this top that you guys got on today, you know?  I'm looking to get into some amateur stuff myself, you know?  Maybe you guys could put me in the right direction.  I'm looking to put together a film.  Well, I'm sure this guy is listening.  He'll call the show.  Because I've got to find out what it's all about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where does he get them?  They look very homemade.  Well, you get one for me, you know?  These labels on them that look like they came right out of your printer kind of thing.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  He sent us about, I don't know, ten of them.  What is Amanda the soccer mom? 
[00:07:00]  The soccer mom.  See, and this guy that just called up wants to get into this.  There's, you know, it takes a special person.  It's either you're a porn star or you're a sloppy mess kind of a thing going on.  There's no mid-ground.  If you think you're going to be all hot and stuff and get up there and you're going to be an amateur porn star,  it probably ain't going to work.  Let's just put it this way.  One of the tapes we popped in, Rick said it best.  He says, her butt looks like a cork board.  A cork board.  Yeah, it was kind of smooth, right?  And then as he got to working on it and she was tensing up, it was like, 
[00:07:30]  what the hell's going on with that ass?  Looked like she was sitting in the old gravel driveway for a while.  Just a little too long?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, well, here we are.  A lot of fun, though.  Back from vacation or whatever, a long weekend.  It was a nice recovery from family, though, you know, seeing a little porno again.  I enjoyed hanging out.  Let me know I was back with the people that I work with.  I enjoyed hanging out with my family this time around. 
[00:08:00]  Wait a minute.  What?  Oh, God.  What's wrong?  I don't know.  My hearing's going or something.  What?  I could have sworn it couldn't be true.  That you actually had a good time hanging out with your family for Thanksgiving?  No, why?  Yeah, because, like, my brothers and sisters, they never have ever had a problem.  Right?  That's never been the issue?  It's like the extended family.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know there's a couple of aunts that you've had issues with. 
[00:08:30]  A lot of aunts with?  Sure.  Yeah.  But my family's finally getting big enough where we don't have to do the extended family  thing anymore.  We just stick to my brothers and sisters and their kids.  Kids and wives and husbands and whatnot.  Right.  All right.  I could get you there.  So, yeah, I had a good time.  Not much to report, really.  Just running around with little kids all day.  Was that it?  Yeah.  Yeah, my family, too.  There's none of the aunts and uncles that drop over anymore.  Nothing like that.  It's usually just the people that are at my grandmother's house.  You know, my family and whatnot. 
[00:09:00]  And then the kids, also.  They went from, we had a new crop come up, you know, when all my cousins had kids and  stuff.  And even my uncle, who's very close in age to me, had kids.  And, yeah, I remember a couple of years back when they were 9, 10, something like that.  Very quiet, but, like, in a kid-like way.  You know, they're always running around kind of being animals and stuff.  Now they're kind of too cool for the room.  They don't want to be with the family.  And I totally remember going through that phase.  What age?  Like 14? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  That's the age.  And they're just, hey.  They don't talk to anybody.  No, they find their own little corner.  You know, they used to run in and grab either my mother or my aunt or something like that.  And I had a big hug and kiss.  Now they're just, hey, hey.  And my mother says something to them.  They're just, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right, right, right.  They're too cool.  Get out of here.  With their huge feet and dumb voices.  Their huge feet and dumb voices.  You nailed it.  And did you nail it.  The cool little room.  Right. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, I remember, though, you know, and it's weird because the house, it's the same house that I grew up in.  And I spent my Thanksgivings and Christmases in and dealt with aunts and uncles.  And I know I was the same way.  Big feet and dumb voice.  Right.  I didn't even go downstairs.  Hang on with her.  Hang on with her.  When it's time to change.  It was, absolutely.  And then we, my family, of course, again, this year, you go through the people that have died over the year. 
[00:10:30]  Do you have people dying every year?  Well, extended family members.  People from Jersey, from other boroughs that have been older.  We haven't seen them in years.  But, you know, they die.  Right.  People that are up, this year it was Shirley.  Shirley died, I think.  I haven't seen Shirley in probably 10, 15 years.  My great aunt died a couple months back.  Which one?  Really fast, because you're on a little thing here. 
[00:11:00]  My grandma's sister.  Yeah.  And she wanted to be buried at sea.  I think.  Buried at sea?  In the, yeah.  In Mexico there.  The, what is it there?  Acapulco.  Florida in Mexico.  The Gulf of Mexico.  The Gulf of Mexico.  The Gulf of Mexico.  And a lot of people in our family thought that, because they carried her plans out, that they thought they were just dumping her body overboard.  Oh, my God.  I swear to God. 
[00:11:30]  Buried at sea?  Not cremate and sprinkled the whole body?  No, no, no, no.  That's where the confusion is.  Yeah, yeah.  It was cremated.  She was cremated.  And then, yeah, the ashes in the Gulf of Mexico.  But a lot of people in my family thought they were just dumping the body overboard.  Ah.  Like a, like a big pussy from The Sopranos.  There you have.  Right?  You just dump them over.  So go ahead.  Well, whenever people die and older relatives in my family, all of a sudden these, these stories come out at various holidays. 
[00:12:00]  And, um, this, this Thanksgiving it was, uh, a few relatives that got brought up.  But it's always about the mafia.  I'm not even going to try to be coy about it.  It's always about mob-related stuff.  That's why when I hear people talking about, ah, kids, the Italians, bad names, shows like The Sopranos, the movies, the mob movies.  There's not one Italian family that doesn't have people in it.  Thank you.  That have been involved in some form, low-level or upper echelon of organized crime. 
[00:12:30]  And, uh, the stories are coming out.  My uncle, Joe, and, uh, my mother were telling stories.  And, uh, I'm listening, like, dumbfounded about how my grandfather, grandfather Giselle.  Giselle.  Giselle?  Yeah.  I feel like I'm, uh, watching a Welcome Back, Cotter show right now.  He would, uh, he would, uh, take these, uh, slips of paper.  Ribbons.  Ribbons, he called them.  The ribbons. 
[00:13:00]  And put them in my mom's sock when she was a kid, when they lived up in Harlem, when Italians lived up in Harlem.  And, uh, and, uh, my Uncle Joe, he put it in the underwear, the ribbons.  And they'd ask, what is this, Daddy?  And, uh, my grandfather would be, that's the work.  The work.  They just called it the work.  It was run in numbers.  But he didn't want to get nabbed with the numbers.  So, uh, he'd put them in the kid's clothing and take them for a walk.  Come with a walk.  Come walk with, uh, Grandpa. 
[00:13:30]  Come on.  Come walk down the street.  And they'd walk and, uh, you know, they would be involved with some kind of crime.  They'd go down to, uh, various bars.  One bar, my mother remembered there were piranhas.  Swimming in a fish tank.  I don't know what that was used for.  And, uh, they remember fights always breaking out there.  And then there was, uh, Uncle Jakey.  I had an Uncle Jakey.  And he, uh, he used to, uh, hijack trucks.  Hijack trucks. 
[00:14:00]  Hijack trucks.  And he used to, he used to say, and they'd imitate his voice at the table.  And they'd go, what you gotta do, you always hit the Jew trucks.  Hit the Jew trucks.  Because all you gotta do is slip them some money and they won't argue with you.  So you hijack the Jew trucks.  And the truck would come pulling up and you'd get your pick or whatever was in the back.  And, uh, before school, my mother was telling me, they'd go one floor down in the apartment  they lived in, into an apartment.  And all the little Italian kids would be in there picking out clothing for the year. 
[00:14:30]  And Uncle Jakey also would come, uh, speeding into the backyard with his Continental  and park it in the backyard and go, just leave this here a while.  I gotta go.  And run away.  It was like, it was on the lam.  And some of the names are really good.  Uh, Uncle Jakey, uh, uh, was, uh, Uncle Jacket.  Jacket.  They called him.  I don't know why.  Uh, Uncle Louie was Dolly Dimples. 
[00:15:00]  And, uh, there was Uncle Ralph, who was, uh, up for armed robbery.  And Uncle Jack, who was Airline Jack.  Airline Jack.  I was the Airline Jack.  You know something?  I couldn't get an answer to Airline Jack.  And Johnny Chick, who was the legit guy.  And something about, um, Johnny Cheesecake.  Oh, I don't know who Johnny Cheesecake was.  And we find out all these great stories about how they, uh, ended up in jail.  This guy, Uncle Louie, Dolly Dimples, used to flash, uh, a badge to the little kids around, 
[00:15:30]  uh, uh, holidays.  He'd be, hey, get out of here.  I'm a cop.  And all the adults would be laughing.  And, uh, my Uncle Joe never realized why they were laughing so much.  Because he was arrested more than anyone.  He wasn't a cop.  He was a criminal.  But he carried a badge with him.  And whenever the kids would come up to him,  and he'd flash this badge and go, hey, get away, kid.  I'll have you arrested.  No.  And, and everyone thought, all the kids thought he was really a cop.  And the adults would laugh because he'd been up for armed robbery and everything else. 
[00:16:00]  So this year I got to find out a little more about, um, my family tree.  It's great.  And you told me I was full of ass.  A few years back I went to Brother Joe's wedding.  Yeah.  Which has since ended.  And I said, dude.  Oh, yeah.  I could feel it in the room, man, with the old relatives.  Well, some of the old ones.  It's a little weird, you know.  I could feel some mafia in that, what they do.  Not the new generation like yourself and stuff.  But like the, the older uncles.  No.  I'm like, hey, come on.  What's going on here?  I don't know. 
[00:16:30]  I find out when they die.  Right.  Then I find out.  You know?  Maybe I could have made something of myself.  If they told me, if they told me earlier, when I was in dire straits, you know, years ago,  maybe I would have, uh, went to one of these relatives and asked for him a favor.  And maybe someday I'd have to return that favor.  And that day may never come.  But I would have been there.  You know, telling this stuff, uh, you brought up a memory of, uh, something you did on our show, matter of fact.  Oh, really?  Remember, uh, the, the Furby mobster? 
[00:17:00]  I do remember that, yeah.  Maybe, see, maybe it just rubbed off a little bit.  Part of the family.  How did this go again?  We were going to, um, this was, uh, around Christmas time.  Was it Furbies or, uh?  Furbies were huge.  Or Elmo dolls or what?  I don't even remember.  Elmo maybe?  I don't remember.  It was one of those products that were the year's big toy that you couldn't get anywhere.  People buy them, hoard them, and then take ads out in the paper to try to sell them for huge amounts of money  to poor people that just want them for their kid that can't find them in the store anymore. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  So you and I went through the paper, saw some of these idiots that were selling them for way too much,  called up the number, and messed with them really bad.  Yeah, yeah.  But we got a huge surprise when we called this guy.  Yeah.  I don't think we've ever played this in New York.  Probably not.  It's Anthony and, um, the Furby mobster.  Hello?  Hello, miss.  Uh, I was looking at your ad in the papers.  Yes, are you interested?  Not exactly.  I got a proposition, though.  What's the proposition? 
[00:18:00]  I have acquired, through certain means, a tractor-trailer full of these little Furby dolls.  Uh-huh.  I, at this moment, have no place to put them or to, uh, distribute them.  Uh-huh.  I would like your help.  I can't help you at all, sir.  And, excuse me?  I can't help you at all.  I won't do nothing illegal, okay?  Bye-bye.  Wait a minute, miss.  Ah, dude, you gotta call her back.  Hello? 
[00:18:30]  Please do not hang up on me and hear me out.  This is very important.  Uh-huh.  Is this the party to whom I was just speaking?  That was my mother who was speaking.  Who's this?  Okay.  My name is Bruno Tattaglia.  I have a proposition.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I have a tractor-trailer full of little Furby dolls.  All right.  I need them to be distributed.  I have no means.  I would like to know if you would like to maybe enter a partnership with me and a few of my friends.  And what do I get out of it?  You get, let's say, a cut of the action. 
[00:19:00]  Plus, if we can ever do a favor for you, we will be there for you.  Uh-huh.  To help you and maybe your family.  All right.  What do you want me to do with the dolls?  Do you want me to hold them or do you want me to do?  You hold on and distribute them.  All right.  For me and my family.  How much for a doll?  We're talking $1,000 each doll.  That ain't happening.  You will be in charge of advertising.  Can't happen.  I can't even get $300 a doll now.  You will get $1,000 a doll.  Uh-huh.  Of which my organization will get 98% of the profits. 
[00:19:30]  You will keep two.  And your legs.  You're funny.  Funny how?  Funny how?  Funny?  Funny how make you laugh?  Yeah.  Why don't you come to my house and keep talking like you're talking?

You want me to come there with my boys? 
[00:20:00]  Come right now.  You'll be taking a dirt nap and snoring, my friend.  Oh, you got me so scared.  Do you understand me?  I don't understand.  I believe we have an agreement.

Now back to Opie and Anthony on 96.5 WCMS, Rochester, New York.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out.  We are live, yes. 
[00:21:30]  Wake up.  It's what, November 26, 2001.  Phone's ringing like crazy.  Let's go right back to him for a minute here.  Mike, you're next to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie, what's going on?  How you doing here?  Very well, thank you.  Okay.  Well, I just want to tell you, Opie, I just saw Harry Potter last night.  The only difference between me and you is I actually have a little kid to take with me.  But there's a scene in there I wanted to talk to you about.  You know the part where Harry has to go get his money out of the bank? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Okay, remember you have to go up to that mean little, those little troll people, that mean  one at the desk?  Yeah.  That guy looks exactly like Steven Tyler without the hair.  Hey, that's a pretty good observation.  Now you've got to remember, next time any of you guys see this, because I think you're  the only fag at the station who actually saw the movie.  A lot of people around here saw it, Mike.  Yeah, they're not talking about it, though.  Well, you know what?  I'm not afraid to talk about it.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:22:30]  Look at that.  I took my little daughter.  She loved it.  But you've got to see, he's got the only thing is I think Steven Tyler's lips are a little  bit bigger.  That's funny.  Well, you know, Harry Potter made a net load of money once again this weekend.  Harry Potter.  How much did Harry Potter make?  Another 80-something million, I believe.  Yeah.  Wow, that much?  Setting another record?  A record for a five-day weekend?  Five-day holiday weekend on a year with the number two in it.  The movie was all right.  Blah, blah, blah.  The special effects is what I mean. 
[00:23:00]  The movie was okay.  The special effects were fantastic.  That's what I said.  It was an average movie, I thought.  Yeah, it was.  I thought it was fabulous.  You can hype up anything to make money, though.  You know what, I went to the movie late last night, finally, and I saw Monsters, Inc.  You saw Monsters, Inc.  That's got to be better.  See, I saw that.  That was pretty good.  Thank you.  And I'm going to take my daughter to see that next.  All right, Mike, thank you.  I like that computer-generated thing they're doing.  I've got to tell you, Monsters, Inc., you nailed it, man.  The storyline kind of blows. 
[00:23:30]  It's like, it's a typical kid movie storyline thing.  Because I love checking out those Pixar movies.  Yeah, right.  They're great.  But the computer graphics, the fur?  Yeah, the fur, and also when they were flying on the door conveyor belt thing.  Oh, man.  That was really a great effect.  So you're sitting there going, how the hell did they do this with just computers?  That part of the movie was just amazing.  I didn't really care about the storyline whatsoever, you know what I mean?  Oh, sure you did.  You wanted them to send that little girl back to her room, safe and sound, tuck her in all 
[00:24:00]  snuggy.  What was her name, Boo?  There you go.  Boo.  Boo.  Come on, that was funny.  The whole movie was trying to get her back into her room, though.  Oh, right.  Eventually, you know, we're going to just see at the end when they put the door back together  and he walked in and the girl says, get it?  He had to pee all the world. 
[00:24:30]  They were able to put the door back together, but it was missing a piece, but he had it the  whole time.  He saved it as in the lunch office.  Eventually, though, we're going to not be amazed by the technology that they're doing  with these movies.  Yep.  And we're going to need some storylines as well.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, I think that was a fine storyline for what it was.  It's a kiddie type movie.  I can't wait to see that movie. 
[00:25:00]  What is it?  Jimmy Neutron?  Oh, the little kid there.  The kid inventor?  What's his name?  Johnny Neutron?  Johnny Neutron?  Oh, man, does that look awful.  Well, that I won't be saying.  I saw The Want over the weekend because I wasn't able to get into the Fat Chick movie.  Shallow Howl.  Shallow Howl.  The Fat Chick movie.  What's the one?  It's the one with the, what's his name?  Jet Li.  Jet Li.  Oh.  Okay.  Wow.  Karate guy extraordinaire. 
[00:25:30]  That's pretty good.  And they have the great effect.  You might have seen the commercials for it on TV where he picks up the two police motorcycles  and slams them together and smacks some guy with him.  Yeah, yeah.  The effect, really cool.  Really good.  The story, blue.  Like it was really stupid.  But the effects definitely are made up for it.  So I saw that.  And then for the rest of the weekend, let me think.  Let me think. 
[00:26:00]  EverQuest.  You did EverQuest?  I finally found some guy in Texas.  I think it's the one listener of this program in Dallas, Texas, that found me online when  I was playing.  And he goes, Anthony.  Anthony?  You got a question mark?  I'm like, yeah.  Help me out, dude.  You got to help me.  So we set up camp there.  And he was killing things right until they were almost dead.  And then I'd finish him off for about 16 hours straight. 
[00:26:30]  And I leveled up to, now I'm just short of level 25.  You got to explain that.  He had more status online than you.  So it was easier for him to kill the stuff, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, he's way up there.  And you wanted to, you know, you wanted to get your status up.  So this guy decided, okay, I'll almost kill him.  And then you could do the last kill.  Teamwork.  It was kind of like you were a little cub.  Right.  And he was helping the Yeti.  That's how they teach the little cubs how to kill.  The mommy and daddy lions and maul them to death.  And they're just barely breathing. 
[00:27:00]  And then the cub finishes them off.  I didn't think of it that way.  But that's exactly what it was.  You were the little EverQuest cub online.  So, yeah, I made it up to, I'm just short of 25.  So I got some new stuff.  And now I kick a little more ass on there.  Right.  And it's great.  My addiction.  It's wonderful.  Well, but thank you to Dallas, Texas.  I finally, Yumdar, I think his name was.  Yumdar.  Right.  It was Yumdar.  Yumdar.  Well, he won't hear this for another six hours. 
[00:27:30]  So maybe he'll call tomorrow show.  Yeah, maybe he'll call tomorrow.  Isn't tape delay great when you're trying to do a radio show?  Where you interact with your listeners?  Yeah.  In various cities, they hear us.  So he'll call tomorrow, 24 hours from now, to, you know, react to what you just said.  He, online, he said, I heard your show yesterday about something, talking about hookers and stuff.  But, ah, no, that was not only time delayed, but also recorded.  Right.  That was for our Thanksgiving break.  Right.  So I don't think he really knows when we're on. 
[00:28:00]  Mm-hmm.  So who knows?  Maybe he'll call.  I spent most of the weekend playing Silent Hill 2 for PlayStation 2.  Yeah.  What a huge disappointment.  First one was good, nice and scary.  Silent Hill, you know, for the time, I mean, now it's kind of dated, I guess, because it's  been a few years.  But that was, that's one of my favorite PlayStation games ever.  Mm-hmm.  It was scary, it was enough killing, enough puzzle solving.  Dispense.  The, the mute, the soundtrack was really, really good, creepy. 
[00:28:30]  So you're, you're playing that too?  Playing two in it, it just doesn't compare, it's lame.  What do you play it on?  What happened to the nurses with the humpbacks, with the hatchets, with the hearts beating  on their back?  None of those?  That was like one of the highlights of, you know, Silent Hill.  Yeah.  Silent Hill 2, there's a, there's a whole hospital thing, just like the first one.  And the nurses aren't as scary and stuff.  Nah.  Like, you, you blew it.  You sure it isn't just you?  You kind of, you got used to it?  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  No.  Because then I went online and I was, I was reading other people's reviews and stuff. 
[00:29:00]  Sucks.  Because I'm like, is it just me?  Because when, when the game first hit the market, everyone's screaming and yelling,  this is the scariest video game ever made.  Mm-hmm.  You know, but it was all hype from the, the gaming company, I think.  You know what happens to a lot of games?  Uh, the company and the team that's put together that make these games.  Uh, they put it out.  The game is a huge success.  The team is long gone.  A lot of times it's very hard to keep a team of, uh, uh, programmers and writers of a storyline 
[00:29:30]  together in one spot.  They're always getting offers.  And if a game takes off, it's like a football team or a baseball team that does well.  Right.  The people that were involved in that win, uh, of, of a big game or having a great game  out there, all of a sudden get, uh, uh, jobs at other companies and they take them away.  Or sometimes the entire license for that series of games is bought by a company that just doesn't  do it right.  Yeah.  They just bought it so the other company doesn't put out a better version of it, uh, and take 
[00:30:00]  away from their big game.  Right.  That they're putting out.  So it's, it's very hard to get a good follow-up game.  Yeah, it's just, uh, I don't know.  I mean, I'm only about halfway through.  I'm hoping it gets better, but we'll see.  What's up, Jim Norton?  I'm just fascinated by this discussion.  You are just not into gaming.  And you have an addictive personality.  I know you do.  You should, uh, join in.  I just, I'm thinking that they cloned a human being for the first time and you guys are  amazed by Disney graphics.  Well, that's a good point.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Well, you got a point there.  I, I did look away from my monitor for a couple of seconds to see that on Fox News.  So, yeah.  Boy, you sure know how to put things into perspective, you prick.  You nailed it.  Yeah, it's perfect.  So nailed it.  Yeah, how about that game?  Oh, yeah, cloning.  Ho-hum.  Uh, Mando.  Yo.  What's up, bro?  Dude, you've been talking about, like, the whole Mafia thing earlier, the Mafia stories,  and then now Silent Hill 2.  Yeah.  You've got to try Grand Theft Auto 3. 
[00:31:00]  Have you ever heard of it?  Oh, yeah, no, we've heard about that.  All right, now, is that all hype?  Because I'm hearing just great things about Grand Theft Auto 3.  It's one of the most amazing games out there, dude.  You can do anything you want in there, like steal cars, kill people, like blow up helicopters.  Like, it's all action.  Yeah, we were talking about it late last week, and the reviews on that game are pretty huge.  Yeah.  It's one of the hottest things.  The thing is, you have to get all the codes, too, because you get to, like, use a tank,  blow people up, like, tear people's arms off, like, blood everywhere. 
[00:31:30]  It's pretty insane.  People love the blood and violence.  They love the gore.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Here's this guy, Tim, on Line 3.  Check this game out.  I just read a bunch about this, but they didn't do it quite the way they should have.  Tim.  Hey, Tim.  You there?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, it's Jim.  Jim.  All right, Jim, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, I tried this game, and they called my house.  Yeah, it's called Mystique.  Mystique.  Yeah, and my wife found them almost calling the cops.  Wait, what happened? 
[00:32:00]  Hold on.  Hold on, Tim.  Let me explain this a little to open, everybody.  There's this game out.  It's called Mystique.  You sign up.  You put in some pertinent information of yours, and you'll get e-mails.  You'll get, yeah, you'll get e-mails.  You'll get video clips, and you'll get phone calls from people at 2 in the morning saying,  Oh, my God, someone's been killed.  You've got to go to this website right away.  Get this information.  And your whole thing is trying to solve this big spy crime puzzle thing. 
[00:32:30]  But real people really call your house.  But do you know the real people that call in the house?  No, all of a sudden it could be like, Hey, you don't know what you're in for.  You better not give that information out to LZ, or I'm going to kill you and stuff.  So you've got to tell everybody at your house, I think, that it's just a game.  Don't worry about it.  But here's what I've heard about it.  It's a whole wait, wait thing. 
[00:33:00]  You log on.  You put your info.  You might get a phone call.  But the whole thing is you read one e-mail, and then you've got to wait like five days  before you're able to do like something else that lasts maybe two minutes to look at a video clip.  Then you wait another week, and you might get a phone call.  And the whole thing is driven to send you to websites.  So it's like it sounded like a great idea, like you were kind of getting involved in something.  But it turns out to, I think, just be a giant commercial.  So, Jim, they were calling your house?  They called my house.  I went to sleep. 
[00:33:30]  My wife comes home from work, right?  And she checks the answer machine.  And so I did know I went to the website, like you said.  And the lady calls back going, oh, my God.  Don't go on the website.  They're going to get you.  They're going to get you.  And like that, she wakes me up, like, Jimmy, Jimmy.  I call them the cops.  Somebody's, you know, robbing the house, or somebody's getting killed on the phone.  She almost had a heart attack.  I said, oh, my God.  It's only a game, honey.  It's only a game.  She almost had a heart attack.  It's called majestic, you told me. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  That's what me.  Oh, it's majestic?  Me from this here is saying.  It's majestic.  It's majestic.  I don't know.  I didn't buy it.  I read about it.  All right.  Hey, thanks, Jim.  All right.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Peace.  Yeah, I heard it's kind of flop.  It's kind of a flop.  Yeah.  And especially in this, you know, in our post-September 11th mentality.  You know, it's kind of, oh, yeah, terrorists are calling my house.  What?  Right.  Is there anthrax in my mail?  Jimmy, what's going on?  Hello?  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  What's up, Jimmy?  Hey, dude.  My friend let me call that Silent Hill game.  Which one?  The second one?  The first one.  The first one, yeah.  Yeah.  And you know how the little naked babies are stabbing you?  Yeah.  They make like a little noise, right?  And when I go to bed at night, I kept on hammering that noise, and I couldn't sleep for two weeks  because I kept on hammering that noise in my sleep.  I'm telling you, the soundtrack, like the music and the sound effects for Silent Hill 1 was just so right on.  The monsters were right on.  It was one of the, it was so scary. 
[00:35:00]  I know.  I jumped out of my seat a few times playing that game because I would turn off all the lights.  It was in the middle of winter.  It was like one of those lazy, rainy, winter afternoons, and I jumped a few times.  When the dead body falls out of the locker.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Holy heck.  When you jump during a movie, you feel kind of silly.  You're like, ah, they got me.  When you jump during a game, you feel like a complete idiot.  You sit there and go, holy, yeah, but it's right there in front of me.  Silent Hill, especially the first one, it was kind of like that show on MTV, you know, what was it, Fear? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, Fear.  And, you know, you're in these deserted hospitals and schools and stuff with all sorts of crap and blood.  And all sorts of places, yeah.  Yeah, rust all over the place.  And you're walking down these creepy hallways with the music playing, and you only have a flashlight, so you can't really see everything around you.  Yeah.  And if you really start focusing on the TV and really getting into the game, you really start feeling like, holy, what's going to jump out at me?  That's how Half-Life was, too, when that first came out.  Yeah, they recreated that show.  It's like the world's scariest places on Earth. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  There's a place in Las Vegas.  It's like a banded hospital, and police say you can go in there, just don't vandalize it.  Right.  So you can go inside there, and you can also, like, there's this thing that, like, you would slide the bodies in.  I think you lost track, Opie.  How long into the call?  We weren't very long into that call.  Jimmy, Jimmy, I'm losing you.  I'm losing you.  Get a health drink and call us back.  He lost his train of thought.  A little Silent Hill 2 humor for you. 
[00:36:30]  Didn't you hear when it happened in that call?  You heard when he lost his train of thought.  Derailed.  Not scary.  No.  Nothing pulls out of the closet.  No.  No, I know it.  You've got to play some of these days.  No, I don't.  I don't know what you do with your life.  You know what's scary?  All right, when you have a little balloon on action with a girl.  Yeah.  No bag, and she says, look, I've got to call my Haitian boyfriend.  He's in the hospital with pneumonia.  That's scary.  Yeah, okay.  I'll give you that. 
[00:37:00]  All right, well, we did this video game break last week.  But, I mean, Christmas is right around the corner.  A lot of people are trying to figure out what to buy and stuff.  Do you buy the Xbox?  Do you buy the Cube?  Well, the memory with the Xbox is, you know, off the charts, but they don't have any games yet.  That's the problem.  Well, that's why it takes time.  That's why I went with PlayStation 2.  I had the choice.  Xbox, PlayStation 2.  I didn't know what to do.  You could still play your PlayStation games on it?  Yeah.  Your old dated ones?  Yeah, those are all dated.  They suck.  You can't even compare the two.  Hey, you know what? 
[00:37:30]  You know why I kind of gave up on the console gaming?  A lot of people ask me, did you play Xbox?  Did you play this?  Did you pick this up?  I'm like, no.  I got my computer.  I upgrade my computer.  Everything's wonderful.  I had the worst experience with Sega.  Remember Sega Genesis came out?  Some cool games for it for its day.  Those were the cartridges, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then they came out with the Sega CD.  Oh, yeah.  It was like a thing, and you plugged your Sega Genesis into it, and you were able to play CDs. 
[00:38:00]  This thing, they put out maybe three games for it, all of which sucked, and did nothing but promise better games, and nothing.  It went away.  And, you know, I had bought this with money I scraped off.  I wanted it so bad.  Then there was another one, the Jaguar.  Remember the Jaguar?  It was another CD-ROM-based thing that just didn't take off.  So I was a little leery about the console gaming.  I know now, you know, the ones that are out there, they're going to get good games for them.  Right.  Put them out.  But I don't know. 
[00:38:30]  I stick to my computer.  I upgrade my graphics card, do things like that.  Dorky things, Norton.  You're looking at me in disgust.  It's not all about effing in this world.  No, no.  You guys do all the things from time to time.  Video games, I'm not saying, are awful.  The last one I played, this is true, was the racing game on Intellivision.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The little pole position.  That was the last one I played.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You're still driving a pacer?  No, I don't have any more.  Where the cars were made up of eight pixels.  Right, right. 
[00:39:00]  Four of which were the tires.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey.  I just wanted to go back to the Grand Theft Auto 3.  One of the things that you guys might be interested in, like when you play the game, when you go into each of the cars,  like you can change the radio stations, and they just make subtle references to real life,  like all the radio stations are owned by one company, and you end up doing jobs for the mafia and criminals and all types of stuff.  You end up doing jobs for the old, like it's called head radio and stuff, and it's head entertainment or whatever. 
[00:39:30]  The guys into all kinds of stuff, like effing dead people and crap.  Here's the kind of guy that tells the story, and you just don't know what he's talking about, but, you know.  Hey, thank you, Chris.  Yeah, sorry.  Well, I just thought you'd be interested.  No, we might be.  Yeah, just play it.  You'll get it.  Yeah, all right.  If it was explained.  Damn.  One of the gaming companies called us and wanted some audio of our show.  Was it for Grand Theft Auto 3?  It was for a GT3.  Oh, we blew them off.  We blew them off.  No, we didn't blow them off.  I sent them a demo CD that you guys approved of the list. 
[00:40:00]  It was way back in the spring.  Yeah.  And they just never got it off the ground.  They went in another direction.  Oh, they went in another direction.  Okay.  Whatever.  Oh, we'd be open to whoring ourselves out to any video game.  That would have been cool.  Sheep Lover.  Because the bugs on that game is huge.  Go ahead.  Sheep Lover says, damn Sega CD.  They F me over.  Did you get trapped into 32X?  Sega had this thing.  It was called 32X.  You plugged it into this already overburdened Sega Genesis and it was supposed to give you 
[00:40:30]  better graphics, better speed, and better games.  They put the contraption out and then put no games out for the 32X.  So you sat there spending money on all these options that came off of this and got nothing  for it.  I hated Sega.  Hey, Anthony, really fast before we move on.  Our buddy Joey Paisano.  Yeah.  Speaking of video games, I guess he went on eBay and he bought the old game Tempest.  Tempest?  Oh, man.  He goes old school with his video gaming and he's got the big arcade console. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, console?  Yeah, he's got one of the ones you would find in the bowling alleys.  Oh.  Is he putting it in Paisano?  No, I asked him because it's too loud.  I have no room.  Oh, that was a cool game.  It's in his basement.  Tempest?  But you play this and you realize how far we have come.  Oh, sheep lover again, Sega.  Night Trap ruled, he says.  There was a game Night Trap.  It was all film.  It was a movie.  And I think Dana Plato was in it.  And you controlled some of the action. 
[00:41:30]  And the way they presented this game was you are the director.  You're telling everyone what to do in this movie.  And if you have somebody walk into a trap, they will die and everything.  It was so bad.  It was worse than that Dragon's Lair cartoon game back in the old days.  I remember.  Where all you got to do was click on an arrow to tell which way the night went.  I remember.  You're like, wow, these graphics rule.  It's a cartoon.  No, there's an actual film playing behind it.  That's why it looks good. 
[00:42:00]  And your control amounts to nothing.  Go through the door.  Click on door.  And then watch a movie.  Watch them run.  Same thing with Night Trap.  It sucked.  Big Kev went in on this.  Big Kev.  Oh, heck yeah, I went in on this.  Sega sucks.  And the Sega CD was already, they already had halted production before it even hit the United States.  Really?  Because they were developing the Sega Saturn.  Remember that one?  The Saturn, another lemon.  So, you mean to tell me by the time people were buying? 
[00:42:30]  By the time the Sega CD hit the United States, they had already stopped production on them.  So, you're buying them knowing, and they knew that they weren't putting any games out for it or anything.  Right, and they developed four games for it, I think, something like that.  And then they went into production on the Saturn.  That company sucks.  Well, then I was known as a sucker.  Yeah, exactly.  You're a stupid American, because I went out and bought it.  That company is a sucker.  All right, Kev.  Good game, man.  Awful. 
[00:43:00]  Sega, where's the United States, as far as Kev's?  Getting back to that game, Majestic.  Yeah.  You said good idea, but eh.  Yeah.  The reviews aren't that great, but basically they call you at home and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  West Coast Dave writes on the instant feedback,  Think your wife would believe it's just a game if your girlfriend calls and says she wants to bang you?  No, it's a game.  It's a game.  I signed up, and they call from time to time.  You know what?  I got an idea for a great game.  I'm a gigolo in this game.  It's not real.  It's on a similar line as that game. 
[00:43:30]  You go out.  You get fronted about a kilo of cocaine, and then you sell it and don't give the dealer his money back.  You'll get phone calls.  There'll be action happening.  It's almost like they want to kill you in real life.  It's great.  It's like people are waiting.  If you get a game that then involves the phone calls and real-life e-mails and stuff like that,  maybe it's better to just have real life and do things like that.  I am one that loves sitting in front of a stupid monitor and playing games for hours on end. 
[00:44:00]  But the second the phone is ringing, or maybe someone's breaking into my car and leaving a code or something that I have to put in a game,  uh-uh, uh-uh.  Speaking of getting into games a little too much, we talked about this last week, but I was catching up on the e-mail.  A guy writes, he goes, you know you're playing too many video games.  He said he was addicted to John Madden football.  And he was so into it that when he was watching real football games, he would do imaginary moves with his hands like he had the console. 
[00:44:30]  Like he's controlling the console.  Like, wait, I've got to pass to that guy.  And he's like, what are you doing?  So he's like doing the imaginary moves as he watches the real games.  That's sad.  And Dan from Hoboken, finally, and then we'll move on, trust me, to other things here.  Norton last played a video game while Voss was writing his current jokes.  Oh.  Wow.  All right.  Let's check out what's going on in the FU line.  We've got to talk about Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears? 
[00:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  Anthony, believe it or not, Charles Nelson Riley calling in today.  Oh, how's that for a topper?  Oh, ho.  He's a show fave, and we'll talk to him.  And Kreskin coming in to show us more of his magic.  To crush our hands and shake our arms.  He'll be here at 5, and he's going to try some new tricks to impress us.  Great.  Because the last two, after he left, we weren't too impressed.  Right.  Okay.  Here's the FU line.  We'll be back.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the O.P. to Anthony FU line. 
[00:45:30]  Hi.  I'd like to give a big FU to my soon-to-be ex-roommate.  You steal my stuff, you eat all my food, and you're an effing slob.  And you know how I know all this?  Because I picked the effing lock on your bedroom door, bitch.  You're just a lazy line C, and I can't wait till you're gone.  FU.  Next message.  Yo, I want to give a big FU to my ex-girlfriend.  She's been stalking me for three, four years now.  I broke up with her two years ago.  FU, stop calling me.  You're calling me this morning. 
[00:46:00]  You're beating people up because you think I'm stalking S.  You psycho.  Go to the loony bin.  Next message.  Hey, Wendy, this is Tammy, and this FU goes out to you.  Little did you think that I would be the one who got to live happily ever after.  Well, you may have married him, but I'm the one who gets to spend the rest of my life with him.  So, Wendy, FU.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  End of message.  All this week with O.P. and Anthony, it's Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets? 
[00:46:30]  So, if you're a mommy, call now.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, you're checking out The O.P. and Anthony Show.  A well-rested O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Hope you had a good holiday, whatever.  Quickly, obviously talking about the gaming platforms that everybody's going to be getting for Christmas,  either Xbox or the Gaming Cube. 
[00:47:00]  A lot of people say I'm crazy for getting PlayStation 2.  I can't wait around for games.  I need games now.  I understand that.  Xbox is a much better unit.  I understand that.  But they don't have any games yet.  They're coming.  I don't want to wait around for that.  That's Microsoft.  But Tenchman, the Sega thing, Dreamcast, the latest one, stop making the system after a year,  and you can pick up a Dreamcast now for what?  $49.  $49.  It just leads me to believe that there are those families out there, and a kid wants the Xbox or the GameCube, 
[00:47:30]  and the parents have to go out, and they pick him up a Dreamcast, and he opens it up at Christmas and looks like,  because many parents don't know.  Yeah.  Oh, look, it's a game.  It's just like the Xbox, but it's only $50.  Kids know so much more about that stuff than their parents.  So the poor kid opens up and goes,  I think it's the Xbox, and it's a Dreamcast.  I got you that X-Cast thing.  No, no.  It was the Xbox Dreamcast. 
[00:48:00]  Remember that?  I remember once I was a kid.  Once I was a kid.  I wanted the G.I. Joe helicopter.  I wanted the one.  HITICOPTER.  HITICOPTER.  I wanted the G.I. Joe helicopter.  I wanted the one you sit G.I. Joe in, you flip the switch, the rotors go, it's got lights on it and everything.  I'm like, this is great.  It's put out by Hasbro, you know, custom made for G.I. Joe. 
[00:48:30]  Well, I told, you know, my mommy, this is what I wanted for Christmas.  Christmas comes, the big box is there.  I know it's a G.I. Joe helicopter.  I'm so goddamn excited.  Oh, no.  I ripped the paper apart.  I look, it's a generic 13-inch action figure helicopter.  Big plastic green thing with a rotor that doesn't even have a motor.  You've got to spin it with your hand.  No doors, no lights, nothing. 
[00:49:00]  This crappy action figure helicopter.  It's like, I thought I was specific here.  Well.  I thought I was specific.  I wanted the G.I. Joe motorized light-up helicopter.  I'll tell you exactly what happened.  Your mom heard you.  She wrote it down and stuff, but she was too busy partying and she did all her Christmas shopping Christmas Eve.  And all the responsible parents went out early and bought up all the helicopters.  You know, I'd be the first one to say, yes, my mom probably was partying too hard.  But no, that is absolutely not the responsibility of what happened. 
[00:49:30]  It was because I know there are plenty of other people that that happened to.  It just, they don't pay attention.  They don't understand.  Like a kid, it's very important the slight difference between a G.I. Joe helicopter that you want and this generic thing.  But the parents don't know that or don't listen.  So they go out and they buy a piece of crap.  That's why kids will be getting the goddamn Dreamcast.  I got to the X-Stream, Fox, Fox, Station, Cube. 
[00:50:00]  No, you twat.  I wanted this.  Once a goddamn year, you've got to go out and get me something.  And you F it up.  God.  So which one out of the three you don't think will make it?  There's no way all three are going to be around.  PlayStation 2 has a track record.  And you know PlayStation 3 is right around the corner.  Right.  Well, that's going to be around.  It's not one that's going to take the lead.  The Xbox is going to be around because Microsoft's behind it.  I think an Xbox and PlayStation will be around. 
[00:50:30]  And GameCube is S out of luck.  GameCube, I'm not sure about.  Yeah, I think that's gone.  But Xbox, it's Microsoft, man.  It's going to be around for a while.  Believe me, there's a lot of hype on it.  And Microsoft knows how to put games out.  Right.  It'll be there.  Okay.  Before we move on to other things, lots of instant feedback coming in.  Jerry from Connecticut.  Guys, in Grand Theft Auto 3, you can pick up one of the hookers in the game,  and pull into an alley, and your car starts rocking back and forth.  Right.  Your health starts going up one unit at a time while your money gets depleted one dollar at a time. 
[00:51:00]  But here's the best part.  Once the hooker's done and gets out of your car,  you can then run her over with your car and get back all the money you just paid her.  Oh, that's great.  Jimmy checking in.  Say, hey, guys, I kind of know what you mean.  I asked for an Averex leather coat for Christmas last year.  They got me a generic one.  I couldn't wear it.  The kids with Averex's kicked my ass when I did.  Remember that?  Or what about, like, when Oakley's were huge?  Sunglasses.  And then they were putting out these glasses that looked like Oakley's but weren't. 
[00:51:30]  But they weren't Oakley.  Like, the whole reason is because it was Oakley.  Mom and Dad can't tell that the kids at school can.  Look, I got you in the glasses like your friends have.  No, you dick.  God, you're so stupid.  It's not Oakley's.  You're going to have to spend some cash.  You can't get off cheap or I'm going to come out punched.  When Pumas were really in, the Puma sneakers?  Yeah.  But instead of a Puma, it was like a koala bear.  But they made a koala bear look like a puma.  And the koala was stelt like with the same ponds. 
[00:52:00]  Right.  Mom, I'm going to get peed up now.  I bought kikies.  Jillian, what's going on?  Hey, dude, what's up?  Whoa.  Wow, you sound really stoned.  Oh, yeah.  I've been doing bong hits all day and I just took some really good painkillers.  I'm feeling good.  What kind of painkillers?  Oxyshompson or other.  I don't know.  Your acne is going to clear up.  Oh, no, it's like a painkiller. 
[00:52:30]  I know.  I've seen you.  Ah, thank you.  Where are you calling from there, Jillian?  What?  Where are you calling from?  Long Island.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And you just want to call and say hi and laugh a little?  Yeah, pretty much.  You guys are pretty funny when stoners call up, so.  So you figured you'd call stoned and let everyone else get a good laugh?  Yeah, pretty much.  Are you working?  No.  Listen to that.  Do you work?  No.  What do you do? 
[00:53:00]  I just go to college.  You used to go to college?  No, no.  I'm in college.  Oh, where are you going?  A college in Long Island.  A private school.  Oh.  A really expensive one.  Oh, really?  Oh, it sucks.  Yeah, it sucks.  I'm about to graduate.  I don't know what.  What?  You're snooty.  Actually.  Mom and Daddy has all the money and you suck.  No, actually, I take out student loans and I pay for it myself, dude.  What snooty town are you from?  It's not snooty. 
[00:53:30]  That's funny.  What town?  We'll be the judges of that.  It's from, like, Port Jeff.  They're all right.  What?  What?  Beltaire?  No, no, just Port Jeff Station.  All right.  No, not Beltaire.  Trust me, I'm not snooty at all.  Hey, Jillian, hold on the line because Jim Brewer is coming in later this week.  Dude, I love him.  And if we don't play Stoner Spelling Bee when Brewer is here, then, you know, we're doing  our audience a disservice.  I love Jim Brewer.  He's the best.  All right.  Hold on.  You're going to be one of the contestants for Stoner Spelling Bee later this week. 
[00:54:00]  You're going to rule, yeah.  All right, cool.  Nice.  He's coming in, like, two days this week.  He's playing in the city this week.  We're all going.  It's going to be fun.  And Jillian will help us with Stoner Spelling Bee later on.  Okay.  Pat from Smithtown says, maybe the helicopter is the only thing that fell off the truck.  Rick, getting back to my roots in organized crime.  And Rick, or Rich, Rich from Union, saying, I got the G.I. Joe helicopter.  Too bad they brought me the black soldier.  Why is that a bad thing? 
[00:54:30]  Did you have a black G.I. Joe?  I didn't know one white kid that had a black G.I. Joe.  I don't remember if we had the black G.I. Joe.  And I had a bunch of them.  We didn't get the whole white kid.  We didn't get G.I. Joe.  I had the G.I. Joe with the life-like hair, G.I. Joe with the Kung Fu grip, which I didn't  really like.  I could care about the Kung Fu grip.  Oh, I had the...  No, I did have a G.I. Joe with the red hair.  You had the red hair with G.I. Joe?  I think he was the red hair black guy.  What?  No.  The G.I. Joe's, man. 
[00:55:00]  Those things rocked when you were a kid.  Black G.I. Joe?  Yeah, the black G.I. Joe.  Screaming white girl not included.  Thank you, Norton.  Mark, what's going on?  You're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, guys.  7th grade.  Growing up in 7th grade, I was very poor.  I wasn't, like, as cool as the other kids.  And all I wanted was the pumps.  You know, those stupid basketball pumps?  Oh, yeah.  Who put those out?  I think it was Reeboks.  Reeboks.  Yeah, the pump.  The Reebok pump.  Now, the kid's getting killed for their expensive stinger.  I wanted those so badly, and I thought, you know what?  I'm going to get these.  I'm going to be the coolest kid. 
[00:55:30]  So, sure enough, my birthday, what do I get?  Those stupid Olympians.  The stupid big, wide Olympians.  So, the whole year, like, everyone goes, hey, how about those Olympians?  How about those Olympians?  The whole goddamn year.  The stupid special ed.  The wide, you know, like, the white sneakers that the special ed kids wear.  Is this boss?  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  All right, man.  You know what?  My parents would buy the brand names, but they would find the stupid stores that have the,  you know, defective brand names. 
[00:56:00]  I went through hell in gym class also because there was a crossover time between when you  wore the old style sneaker, which was like the PF Flyers.  Remember the rubber tip it had on it and the rubber sole?  It didn't look like the sports shoe you wear now.  It was a sneaker.  And there came a time where that was just not fashionable to wear in school anymore.  You had to have the Adidas or the Nike or something. 
[00:56:30]  The high tops.  Yeah.  And if you had Converse, the high top black sneakers, that was still cool because you were  just a degenerate burnout.  But my mother wouldn't buy those for us.  We'd always say, I want the high top black.  You look like an N.  She would say that.  Oh, yeah.  She said we look like someone from the Netherlands.  Yes.  No.  She would say that.  You know something, this is going back quite a ways, and she's found church now, I guess,  so everything's fine. 
[00:57:00]  But, you know, growing up in an Italian family, you'd hear that word a lot.  But for some reason, we couldn't get those because I'd look like an N.  Good for mom.  So she would buy me the regular low white ones.  And I'd go to school and be laughed at for my sneakers because I didn't have the cool  Nike or something else that looked like it was from this decade.  Thanks, mom.  We have a couple more.  Maybe you'd get beat up like an N.  Joe, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, guys, I know this guy.  In sixth grade, he came to school, and like those polo shirts with the Ralph Lauren horse  and the jockey on them, those were in.  And his had a dinosaur on it.  And he's like about 30, 31 now, and he's still known as Dino.  Dino?  Yeah, Dino.  Brian Donnelly, Dino.  That's hilarious.  Dude, what's that on your shirt, man?  That's funny.  Dinosaur, hey, Dino.  Dang, stalk your whole life, Dino.  Dinosaur, dick. 
[00:58:00]  That's your bro would say.  Ed, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  We credit our lines on this show.  Yes, we do.  So, instead of Adidas, I got the brand with four stripes.  Huh?  Instead of Adidas?  Yeah.  I got the brand with four stripes.  Did you really?  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Pay less.  And did everyone make fun of you at school?  No, I never wore them, man.  I burned them.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  I'd rather wear my old Nikes that were cool.  That's funny.  You know what I mean?  All right, bro. 
[00:58:30]  Thank you.  All right.  Later.  All right.  My mother works in a predominantly minority school, so now she comes home with FUBU clothes  for me.  Mom, wear white.  It's like for us, by us, clothes.  And you're white, wearing it.  Anthony, this week on the show, we're doing, well, a lot of things.  We're going to do the Stoner Spelling Bee later on this week.  But we're also doing, Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  Oh, yeah.  And the prize is getting bigger and bigger, right, Rick? 
[00:59:00]  Of course.  We're going to throw in some spending money, hopefully a limo, dinner.  Woo!  It's going to be a really big deal.  This is a great way for moms to buy the love back that they've lost from their daughters,  perhaps.  Right.  Your daughter's getting a little older now.  She can't relate to you as much.  She doesn't depend on you as much.  She might be coming home and talking about her friends.  You know, you used to sit and talk with your daughter, didn't you,  Mommy?  And now she's got friends and she's not confiding in you as much.  She's a little distant.  You know?  Now, buy her love.  It's your chance to get her Britney Spears tickets. 
[00:59:30]  Imagine going to the show with her.  Or maybe if you're a real cool mom, you get the pair of tickets.  You get her and her best friend and you just chaperone them.  You wait outside in the limo.  You drink a little, whatever you want to do.  They will love you for this.  Maybe the relationship has been strained.  You went to a divorce recently and now the new stepdad tucks her in  and you've been turning the other way because he pays the bills.  Here's a chance to make it up.  You know, I didn't think of that situation, but that's another way to look at it. 
[01:00:00]  A mother could then give her daughter that and make her feel a little better about it.  Well, that makes up for all those trips to the hospital and lies and dark sunglasses and eye makeup.  Man, you've got to write a book soon, bro.  You've got some stuff in that head.  Okay, so it's easy.  Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  That's it.  Hot is ticking in town.  We've got some good tickets to the show.  We're going to throw in all sorts of other things. 
[01:00:30]  This is what we're looking for.  We're looking for the mommies to call us and tell us what they would do.  We'll pick the best ones.  And I believe it all goes down Friday.  Yes.  Friday will be the Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears show?  Make it good.  Make it original.  Make it something that we will look at and go, wow, that is something that you're actually doing so your daughter can have a good time.  And I have to tell you, we've been taking calls from mommies ever since we started today at 3.  Not one has made the cut.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  All boring stuff.  Dull, dull, dull.  So far we have no contestants.  None.  So mommies, keep calling and keep thinking, and hopefully you can be one of the contestants when we do this on Friday.  Okay?  Right.  Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  Yeah.  It's no one a favorite, huh?  Parents are out of it.  And that's, like you said, with the toys, the parents, they don't understand what's appropriate to do.  We're looking for desperation.  Exactly.  I'll put on a funny dress and sing a song.  No, stupid.  No.  You won't.  No, no, no.  None of that crap.  We want, like, the last time we played this game, we had a bunch of really good ones. 
[01:01:30]  We don't remember all the other ones because the one that won it all sticks in our crow here.  The bottle rocket.  The bottle rocket from the private area.  That's great.  Yeah.  White trash moms, your chance to shine.  Thanks, Ray.  There you go.  Jesus.  And we don't care where you live.  If you could get to New York by Friday and do something crazy for the Britney Spears tickets, we'll listen to you, okay?  Dan from Hoboken.  Ant, your mom got you a generic helicopter and your ex-wife donated your cool remote control helicopter to charity. 
[01:02:00]  Isn't it great how life goes full circle?  Shut up, Dan.  Dan's on fire today.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Okay.  More junk on the way.  Stay there.  All this week with Opie and Anthony, it's Mommy, What Would You Do for Britney Spears tickets?  So, if you're a mommy, call now.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Now, back to Opie and Anthony on 96.5 WCMN, Rochester, New York. 
[01:02:30]  We're back to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hoy!  And it's official.  We have a bunch of whores that work for this company.  That's for sure.  Holy ass.  Here in New York, when we just went local, playing our cute little commercials that we do.  In your city, they play different commercials.  We're running a spot on the Opie and Anthony Show for satellite radio. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, satellite radio.  You know, it's the new range.  And no one has a problem with this in this company?  Let's call it the competition.  Right.  They're advertising during our show, telling people basically that they have another option  out there.  That all over, like, no matter where you drive, you won't lose the signal.  They're talking about all this great stuff that you don't get by listening to the very station  that's advertising it.  Who gave the okay to take that? 
[01:03:30]  A bunch of whores.  It's hard enough to compete in this day and age in radio.  And now, now they're just going to run spots in the competition on our show.  And they have no problem with this whatsoever.  Uh, uh-oh.  Who is it?  What?  It's Jessica, huh?  Get, you know, could you get Ken Stevens on the phone?  I want to ask him. 
[01:04:00]  I want to ask him the logic.  That's a great thing.  The logic behind this.  You know, I, um, I don't usually like getting Ken because he's radio kryptonite when he's  live.  Just fun, fun kryptonite.  And, uh, but this makes sense now to get him and ask him why we would be doing that.  Why?  Is it, is it, they bought our show because we have a huge audience, okay?  Yeah.  And the commercial is basically telling everyone that you don't need to, you know, listen to 
[01:04:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Uh, there's other choices out there.  Why don't they just want a commercial with every other, uh, show that is on, you know,  against us?  Yeah.  And then have the listeners decide, well, I'm going to try out a couple of these shows.  I got an idea.  Here's what he's going to say.  Oh, they're not going to do well.  It's just like that click radio and the e-yada and all the internet radio thing that failed.  So we'll take a little bit of their money, uh, and it'll just fail anyway. 
[01:05:00]  That's what they'll say.  Well, Mark, my word.  Get him on the phone?  Yeah.  All right.  We're trying to get him on the phone.  But the thing is, it's not like internet radio.  It's going to be installed in cars and stuff.  Oh, that HBO.  It'll never catch on.  That'll never catch on.  It's silly.  People paying for TV, it'll never happen.  If man were meant to fly, he'd have wings.  That is a huge insult, man.  I hope they're getting a lot of money to whore themselves out like that.  Man can't ride on trains. 
[01:05:30]  Don't you know if a human being exceeds 30 miles an hour, he will surely perish.  You know, they used to think that.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah.  It really is.  Can't get him on, right?  Nah.  Huh?  Yeah, we want Ken.  Yeah.  Is Charles Nelson Reilly there, too?  We could have went to Charles Nelson Reilly.  Charles Nelson Reilly.  Oh, ho.  They just canceled out.  Why does it cancel? 
[01:06:00]  Because Charles is in rehearsal.  And he doesn't want to be pulled away and doesn't want to lose his focus.  Charles Nelson Reilly canceled the Opie and Anthony show?  Oh, what do I get to break today?  What is he rehearsing?  He's got his one-man show that he's doing.  Oh, ho.  Where is this one-man show?  It's in Hartford.  Is it a cheap ticket so people can go there?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  And make his night a living hell?  I'm busy. 
[01:06:30]  How's that for a topper?  How's that for a topper?  It's hard to do it and make it sound that gay.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  You think he got wind of us or something?  Why is Charles Nelson Reilly canceling our show?  Charles?  Yeah, you don't want to do that show.  Why not?  Oh, ho.  Well, they sound, um, sounds like they might be homophobic.  Oh, ho, homosexual.  I'll be on in a minute. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, ho.  No, homophobic.  I don't think they'll like you.  Everyone likes me.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Joe, what's going on?  Hold your pants down.  Oh, hey, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey, guys, I know it's rough having a competition, you know, advertising on your show.  Yeah.  But I got to tell you, it's a refreshing one.  Ah.  That's too bad you had to say it that way because they just don't doubt.  Oh, sorry, man.  My junk is too small.  You'd rather hear that commercial instead of the commercials for your unit being too small.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:07:30]  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Tiki rules.  All right.  John, what's going on?  Oh, hey, guys.  My name's John Malone.  I run sales over at K-Rock.  I was wondering if we could advertise for the Kane Show.  Yeah, you might have done it.  All right.  You might have done it.  Who do I talk to?  What's her name?  No, here.  Go ahead.  Buy 30 seconds on our show.  Tell everyone why they should listen to Kane.  I was wondering, can we get bulk at disco?  Call the sales.  Call sales upstairs. 
[01:08:00]  I'm sure they'll hook you up.  Will they offer bulk?  Ah, probably.  Yeah, yeah.  They'll probably give it away.  Just show them like money.  Wave a few 20s under their nose.  They start frothing at the mouth, and they'll latch right onto your yam bag.  All right.  Thanks, man.  It's amazing.  Thanks, guys.  I'll give it to Kyle.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Yeah.  Radio is really getting pathetic.  It's ridiculous.  This used to be a business where every radio station was for themselves, and they just fought, 
[01:08:30]  literally fought on the street.  We used to get in fights because someone else's van was parked outside the venue for a concert.  Now all the stations are owned by the same person or the same company, and they don't want  you talking bad about this station or that station because you're going to hurt the company.  It's making radio so bland and boring.  Yeah.  And now on top of that, they don't mind taking advertising dollars from the competition.  Right.  They see no problem with this. 
[01:09:00]  Holy ass.  You can't curse, though.  They don't see a problem with this.  Will there be cursing over this satellite radio?  Because I want to gig over there.  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  I want to gig over there.  You know.  It's not regulated.  But here's an anonymous guy that works for the company that we just run the company for.  Anonymous one.  Yes.  Hey.  How's it going?  How are you doing today?  How are you guys here?  He's going for an O. 
[01:09:30]  Just want to tell you, for about the past three weeks now, our lovely company has been  running these spots in D.C. on JFK.  Yeah.  And on my particular station as well.  Yeah.  Look at you.  You're taking over like the Taliban do.  All right.  All right, Anonymous one.  Our big boss is on the line.  We've got to talk to you.  Okay, cool.  All right.  Mr. Stevens?  Tell Anonymous we know who he is.  Oh, you know who that is.  How was your holiday, Mr. Stevens? 
[01:10:00]  Excellent.  Yours?  It was very nice.  Yeah.  So the question is, somebody said to me, you're wondering why we're taking these XM satellite  ads?  Very good.  You actually understood the question also, Ken Stevens.  Yes.  Why are we advertising for satellite radio an option to listening to this very program?  Pretend for a minute that you don't know anything about the radio business, and you're  just the average guy listening in your car to those XM radio spots. 
[01:10:30]  Okay.  Do they make any sense to you?  Hold on.  Let me put myself in there, Ken.  Here we go.  You asked us for a lot, and you're not giving us time.  Sorry.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay, I'm sitting.  Opie, sit.  Should I hold, like, a fake steering wheel, Ken?  That would help.  Okay.  I'm holding it, and I'm driving.  Okay.  Now, the ad comes on for satellite radio.  I'm supposed to go, what the hell is this?  Now, first of all... 
[01:11:00]  So you're saying advertising doesn't work, and no one should advertise on radio.  Maybe it's your show.  No.  I think that if you listen to the commercials the way we're running them, they're not awfully  attractive.  Did you hear...  Okay.  Did you hear the one...  How many of your friends are going to go out and spend whatever...  What does it say?  On, on, on...  Now, insert color TV here.  Insert radio here. 
[01:11:30]  Insert car here, where he's going to say.  Are going to buy the Xbox instead of PlayStation.  Right.  Insert any new technology.  Ken, did you hear the one part in that commercial where he says, boy, I could drive through  New York, and I don't have to change the station.  No, I heard the one where he said, and my favorite is the Blues Channel.  Right.  Right.  I'm not really worried about losing a whole lot of audience to the Blues Channel.  Well, not, Ken.  Wow, you guys...  But when those ratings come out and they're down, who will be getting yelled at? 
[01:12:00]  Hey, you know what?  If your ratings are down and your audience has moved over to satellite radio, I'll stop  taking those commercials.  Yeah, but it's a little here, a little there.  It adds up after a while.  We've just ran a 60-second spot pretty much telling people that, besides the Opie and Anthony  show, you've got a lot of options out there.  And do you know that it's going to be an option on all new model cars?  Let me ask you something.  Yeah.  You've got that newfangled cable or satellite in your house?  You need money this bad, Ken. 
[01:12:30]  With all those music channels on there?  Yeah, I got...  Including the Blues Channel?  I think it's great, as a matter of fact.  And if you look at broadcast TV, the ratings are down pretty low because of cable.  Answer my question.  Yeah, I do.  So when you're sort of walking around the house, instead of turning on the radio, you  turn on Channel 956 and listen to the Blues Channel or the Kits Channel or...  I believe there's enough people that do it that chip away. 
[01:13:00]  There's my TV and there's my radio, though.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And I'm not watching TV in my car.  Why assume all this, Ken?  Do we need the money that bad?  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  Hey, we're in the...  Why don't we just list all the shows that are on opposite us?  Because that's what you just did.  Why listen to Opie and Anthony?  Go check out Kane on K-Rock.  Or Mike and the Mad Dog on The Fan.  Or why don't you go to 1010 Winds and get your traffic and weather together on The 10.  You know something? 
[01:13:30]  Personally, I would have done it.  You just did that free.  I would have charged them for that.  Oh, there you go.  And Opie, you're talking about people in the same company.  There's a great classic rock station in town.  Why don't you guys check that out for a while?  Because Opie and Anthony, quite frankly, they're boring.  You're killing us.  You know, I took out the one where XM wanted to run the spot that said you were boring.  I didn't run that one.  Really?  Yeah, no.  I stuck to the one that said, Blue's Channel.  The company has no problem with this?  I guess not. 
[01:14:00]  I don't know.  Must have been a big buy.  Must have been here.  It wasn't a...  Well, they probably will now that you've made an issue out of it.  Uh-oh.  It was supposed to be under the radar.  Oh, yeah.  Because our listeners are stupid.  When the head of infinity gets wind of this, maybe then there'll be a little bit of a problem,  huh?  So I learned our listeners are stupid, and they don't really get advertising anyway.  The advertising isn't effective.  And this thing is something that Ken has dubbed newfangled. 
[01:14:30]  Newfangled.  So I don't think it'll take off.  I don't think you guys were paying attention, but that's okay.  Oh, God.  All right, Ken.  Well, thank you.  That wasn't what I said.  Thank you for clearing that up for us.  Okay.  But, you know, I mean, if you're really certain that you're losing listeners to that blues  channel on satellite radio, I'll stop taking the commercial.  Hey, Ken, you want to talk about New York radio personalities and get dumped out of like 
[01:15:00]  we do?  What's that?  Do you?  What was the question?  I said, do you want to talk about, I don't know, some New York radio personalities and  have the fun of being dumped out of?  Lots of people get dumped.  Right?  Sometimes they do.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  You guys, what, do you have a bad Thanksgiving?  What happened?  No, we've, actually, we've been having a really good show until we just heard a commercial  for competition.  Well, I'm talking about Mike and the Mad Dog. 
[01:15:30]  All right, Ken.  Bye.  Ken, hello.  Yes.  All right, Ken.  Thanks for clearing that up.  No problem.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Come on, I had to stick him a little bit.  He's mad at us?  I know.  You know what the funniest part is?  When he hangs the phone up, you heard that.  You know he didn't hang up and go, okay, what's next on my list?  He hangs up and goes, hangs up and goes, here he is. 
[01:16:00]  Here's the end of that call.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  Those mother...  Every time these f***ing f***holes get me on the f***ing phone about this stupid f***ing f***.  That MTV is just a fad. 
[01:16:30]  That's a fad.  A fad.  Video can't really kill the radio star.  You know, that's an insult.  He's mad.  Screw it, man.  That's an insult.  You know what?  You know what he's mad at?  I know what he's mad at.  Huh.  He was waiting for the Charles Nelson Riley call on our show.  And instead he had to take the abuse.  He wanted to hear Charles Nelson Riley.  Ho, ho.  Oh, brother. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  Dan, what's going on?  Not much.  I work for a radio station.  I was going to agree with you that salespeople are whores.  Of course they are.  Of course everyone knows that.  Exactly.  I think they probably sold that spot for a car.  Hey, hey, hey.  You say you work for a radio station and you curse on the air?  You don't know how to do radio.  I'm sorry.  I don't go on the air.  I work for Roja.  All right.  Thank you.  You got it.  There was a day when sales didn't control radio, Anthony, but now controls it. 
[01:17:30]  I remember a time in this company that they would fight with the competition.  But now they welcome the business of the competition on their airwaves.  Let's see.  Hundreds of distortion-free channels that travel with you being offered in high-end cars driven by decision makers.  Ken's right.  It'll never catch on.  It'll never catch on.  That's good. 
[01:18:00]  You know, guys, I'll be doing a gig tonight.  But, you know, I don't want to talk about it.  Let's plug Rich Voss.  Yeah, I got the information.  Mike, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I'm a multi-room audio installer.  Yeah.  We don't even install tuners anymore.  What we do is put in satellite systems.  They use the music channels for them.  It hasn't caught on at all, though, and I do all high-end customers all over Long Island.  So, like, no one's getting regular radios anymore in their cars?  No, because out past Central Island can't get, you know, any radio stations from the city. 
[01:18:30]  So everybody just goes to satellite radio and gets all the music they want to hear.  All right, great.  Thank you, Mike.  All right.  Have a good one, guys.  I wonder if, at some point, they'll make deals with people like us to carry our show, if people want that as an alternative no matter where they drive.  But then it says, okay, what about if you're driving through an area that we're on at a regular radio station and you can get it on satellite? 
[01:19:00]  Where's the revenue coming from?  It just throws a whole bunch of...  Following the logic of this, I'm just assuming that this great company of ours is buying satellite radio.  Well, you know, it's not a jump in the gun.  It makes sense.  But you know what?  Get it up there and then buy it.  They're probably not buying satellite radio.  No?  But instead, they're running ads for the competition on not only this station, but a lot of the stations in this company.  And no one sees anything wrong with that. 
[01:19:30]  I think Ken knows more than he's letting on to.  He knows that there's a huge infinity missile that is ready to knock out the satellite the second this goes online.  That must be why he's so calm about it.  And then, you know, you nailed it.  We're going to knock it out with a laser.  And you nailed it.  You nailed it.  You said he would, like, downplay it.  Like, oh, my God.  How many people will actually do this?  Come on.  Opie, contrary to popular belief, I actually have been conscious during segments of meetings with Ken. 
[01:20:00]  So I kind of know that there is this little thing that goes on.  I kind of know a little bit about it.  In between my nodding off, the Alan Parsons project.  Paul, what's up?  Laser.  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, hey.  See Ken sitting in the chair.  Hey, go ahead.  Hey, I work for a sob dealership in New Jersey.  Why don't you tell Ken that all the new sobs are shipping with the satellite radio, and so are BMW as an option. 
[01:20:30]  Well, you know what?  But people aren't really buying sobs these days.  Oh, no, no.  Of course not.  BMW is a small little thing in Germany.  You know, those crafts don't got it over here.  Yeah, that'll never catch on.  Nah, nah.  Of course.  Nah, not at all.  Thank you, Paul.  I got to go kill the giant mosquito outside of my window.  All right.  Thank you.  Good luck.  Ah, Joe.  What's going on?  Yo, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  I just want to know.  Can you repeat everything you said?  I lost the signal, man.  That's why you were talking to Ken.  So, like, I missed everything, you know?  Classic, you dick. 
[01:21:00]  Very good.  All right.  Thanks, dude.  Bye.  Bye, man.  That's pretty funny.  Lauren, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hey, I can't believe what a jerk he is, because when he said, you know, just pretend you're  an average listener in the radio who knows nothing about the business, I was screaming,  yeah, that's you, Ken.  Thank you, Lauren.  Oh, well.  Well, yeah, because you can't really, you can't bank on the fact that everyone's stupid. 
[01:21:30]  You know what I mean?  And then you set a precedent.  Yeah.  You know, well, we ran the satellite spots, and what the hell, you know, Clear Channel,  they want to advertise on the O.P. and Anthony show, because after all, they're kicking, you  know, all their stations.  So why don't we start advertising on the O.P. and Anthony show?  We'll take their money, too.  Why not?  They can advertise for KTU and Z100 and Q104 right on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Who's going to listen to them anyway?  Yeah, we have a problem with this one. 
[01:22:00]  Kreskin is here?  Ah, he should have seen this coming.  Let's ask him about the satellite radio.  Kreskin's here.  Hi.  That handshake.  All right, well, we've got to take a break.  All right.  All this week with O.P. and Anthony, it's Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  So, if you're a mommy, call now.  The O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:22:30]  Now back to O.P. and Anthony on 96.5 WCMS, Rochester, New York.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-2774.  Wow.  We're about to do about 30 or 40 minutes of polarity.  But you don't want to stick around for that.  The Alternative Rock Stage and K-Rock, I believe they're starting a 92-minute rock block. 
[01:23:00]  Mike and the Mad Dog, they're having some good conversations today about the Jets season and the Islanders and the Rangers.  Q-104, a great classic rock that you probably haven't heard in a while.  Sure.  C-100 playing all your favorite hits.  Why not?  A few options for you.  Yeah.  Why should we just tell you to stick around here?  I just want to be fair to everyone.  Tony from Milford saying, Ken's right, I still refuse to buy CDs for better sound quality. 
[01:23:30]  Nothing beats the clicks of an LP.  By the way, I'm looking for Phantom Menace on beta.  Any ideas?  Beta.  Remember that?  What format should I get as far as the VCR goes?  Should I get the VHS or should I buy the beta?  Remember the beta?  And you used to be able to, when video stores first opened up, video rental stores,  and you had to pay the $100 membership fee when you first went in. 
[01:24:00]  There was the beta section.  For those of you intelligent people that bought the Sony Betamax,  the VHS, beta was like, oh, it's smaller.  It's got to be the one that hits.  Wrong.  Wrong.  What amazes me even more is he doesn't understand why we would be pissed off at something like that.  The only answer I would accept is that the company that we work for is buying satellite radio.  We're buying a couple channels on there or something.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  Well, maybe they've got a grand plan.  Ken, realize there's no commercials on satellite radio?  We have about 40 minutes of commercials an hour on our show.  Right.  But our listeners, they're so faithful, Anthony,  that they're going to stick through 40 minutes of commercials instead of flipping around looking for what else is out there.  Uh-huh.  And, of course, you know, they ain't going to blow you guys off for a blue station on satellite radio.  Well, what about all the alternative rock stations that satellite radio is going to offer without commercials?  Well, I think they have a bunch of other talk shows as well, Anthony, 
[01:25:00]  and I believe they have some comedy stations.  I think they're so faithful, they'll kill for us.  Because they don't have brains of their own, Anthony.  I think there's a grand plan.  We're just not supposed to understand.  We best just leave it to them.  Now, one other personality that works for this company had the balls to speak up.  Because now I'm hearing they've been running these spots for weeks.  Hmm.  Dan from Hoboken.  Ken Stevens' theory of radio is like Rich Voss' theory of comedy. 
[01:25:30]  New material?  Ha!  That never catches on.  Ha!  And Dan from Hoboken again.  He's on fire today.  Did Ken Stevens also decide to put a Carol Burnett special on CBS during November sweep?  Oh, God.  Carol Burnett.  I think that was a good decision, by the way.  Carol Burnett was very funny, and there's nothing but crap on television.  So bring her back.  You like that, Carol Burnett?  I loved her growing up.  She was hilarious.  Well, growing up, who didn't love the hijinks of Carol? 
[01:26:00]  I love how they can't get through a skit without laughing.  I do like that.  And they crack up.  They crack each other up, and they forget their lines, and they can't get back on the script.  How about they do an episode on Harvey Korman walking around with Alzheimer's late at night before he got on some medication?  I remember reading this years ago, that they found him just walking around and banging on people's claws.  That old gag. 
[01:26:30]  I love when celebrities do that.  Like, Margot Kidder did it.  She lost her effing mind.  And the other one, what's her name?  Anne Heche did it.  Anne Heche did it, yeah.  The Margot Kidder thing is frightening.  They found her in, like, bushes or something.  Yeah, Margot Kidder, they found underneath someone's stairs, their outside stairs, behind some bushes.  It's like, hey, you're Margot Kidder.  Hey, Lois Lane, what are you doing?  We're Superman.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, man, what's happening, boys? 
[01:27:00]  Not much.  I want to enter the Britney contest.  You're not a mommy.  Well, I get called a mother every day.  There's another word after it, but I get called a mother every day.  We're doing mommy.  What would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  We've got some great seats for the show in the city here.  We're going to probably throw in a limo by the time this is done and spending money and free dinner.  It's a really big deal.  And so far, we've had a lot of mommies and tools like Sean calling in.  And so far, we have no contestants when we do this contest on Friday. 
[01:27:30]  I don't get it.  I will be at the studio Friday, and if Stalker Patty agrees to it, I will go south on that nasty thing.  You have to be a mommy for this contest.  Right.  If you could find a girl that could substitute and be your mommy to officially win the tickets  and then give them to you, you could make that little deal on the side, I don't care,  then sure, we'll listen to you.  But this is a mommy contest.  All right?  All right.  Thank you. 
[01:28:00]  Carolyn, what's up?  Nothing.  I was curious as to whether or not Ken Stevens realizes that running these ads is just making  more people change their radio stations.  That's what I believe.  But he says, oh, people aren't really listening anyway, don't they?  Advertising doesn't really work.  I do it for a living, but I know it's a crock of S.  You know, to tell you the truth, I don't even listen.  I have my eight tracks in my car, and I'm sticking with them.  So you need, like, a marketing and a sales degree in order to make these big executive 
[01:28:30]  decisions?  You know, and management does that well to us.  I have to say, they chip away at what has made the Opie and Anthony show great.  And every time we bring up one of these points, it's like, oh, that's just a little...  Don't worry about that little thing.  But you know what?  All these little things add up, and they chip away.  They chip away at the show.  They chip away at your credibility.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  They've added so many commercials to our show, it's getting harder and harder for our faithful  listeners to stick through a commercial break.  Right.  And we've been begging, Ken. 
[01:29:00]  Well, I can't.  We're not loved that much where people are that faithful, especially in the new cities,  to sit through these really long commercial breaks.  Help us out.  You're killing us.  You know?  Five or six people will do that.  You start getting higher, it gets a little scary.  Now, on top of those really long commercial breaks, now we're running commercials for...  And competition.  An alternative to the show you're listening to.  So just in case you are faithful and you're in the middle of one of these long commercial  clusters, there's a commercial and they're telling you, well, you know what? 
[01:29:30]  There's this technology coming out and it's crystal clear.  And guess what?  We don't have any commercials.  And I can tell you that that's why...  I don't understand why I'm pissed off about it today.  And Anthony keeps trying to change the subject, but it's the OCD kicking in, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  Well, thank you.  That's why I change my radio station all the time when I'm doing stuff around my house.  Of course.  I put on my broadband station and I just listen to the music I want to hear.  Because you're on broad.  This broad listens to our broadband station. 
[01:30:00]  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  We do have to move on.  Evan, what's up?  Hey, you guys are just like Sandy Clothes in Miracle on 34th Street.  Huh?  You know, you're sending me to Gimble's when I'm shopping at Macy's.  Go to Gimble's.  And look what happened to Gimble's.  Okay, later.  I'm going to listen to Mike and the Mad Dog.  Yeah, why not?  Remember Gimble's?  Tell me what they're doing today, all right?  And then we can broadcast it for everybody.  I'm sure if they pay enough money, they'll run a commercial in the next break.  Anthony.  Dude. 
[01:30:30]  What's up?  I just want to thank Ken Stevens for that fine suggestion for going to listen to, you  know, the blue station on, you know, satellite, you know, radio.  That's a tool.  God damn it.  What is he trying to sabotage you guys?  I mean, how is he trying to shut you guys up?  Now he wants to give plugs for different goddamn stations?  Yeah, well, that's pretty much what's going on.  Tool.  There you go.  This is really wrong, and I needed to say that. 
[01:31:00]  And, you know, I just hope, I just hope and pray that there's a reason why we're running  these commercials.  I'm sure.  And we cannot see the big picture, Anthony.  I'm sure.  Because we're a lowly scum.  You'll hear some announcement, I'm sure, down the line that we're involved in it somehow.  I don't know.  What are you, what are you, I don't know.  I come in, and have a few laughs.  A few laughs.  That's my, that's my day.  Mike, you're next on the opening of the show. 
[01:31:30]  Hey, guys, how you doing?  All right.  Hey, I just wonder if Ken and I ever heard of that little thing, I don't remember exactly  what it's called, HBO, something like that, that non-commercial subscription system on  the TV.  HBO.  HBO, and that really caught on like everyone said it would.  Right.  No commercials, nudity, and lots of cursing.  Yeah, 25 years, you know, one of the fastest growing, something like that, right?  There aren't shows on HBO that outdo network TV shows.  That wouldn't fit you guys at all, right?  You know, the Sopranos would do just as good on regular TV, right? 
[01:32:00]  Wouldn't it?  Absolutely.  All right.  That wouldn't fit you guys at all, right?  Thank you.  See you, man.  Bye.  Voss is on hotline, doesn't want to be on air.  I heard my name, and I'm very pissed off.  Rich Voss.  Hello?  Hey, what's up?  Who's pissed off?  I'm not pissed off.  Oh, all right.  I was half asleep, and I just woke up, and I heard Ken Stevens in my name, so I just  called to say what they were talking about.  Yeah, you're half asleep.  Were you listening to the new Voss album? 
[01:32:30]  There will be one coming out soon.  Well, we're talking about new technology out there.  There's going to be competition for commercial radio, and we're now running commercials for  this new technology on our show, and no one seems to have a problem with that.  Do you know who's the president of that?  Are you talking about satellite radio?  Holy ass.  Here's a guy that doesn't even get up before seven at night, and he knows about satellite  radio.  Do you know who the president...  Wait, hold on.  I have a card right here.  I don't want to upset you guys anymore.  President...  No. 
[01:33:00]  Program Director of Comedy, Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  Do you know who it is?  Who?  Mark Pereno.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, hey.  We have kicked him out of two cities so far.  Hey, Mark.  You know what?  I don't think anybody's new.  Who?  You got to buy a new car to get that, don't you?  The satellite radio.  Of course.  Who has money for a new car, Rich?  I know you can't get that in a 92.  No, I don't think so.  I was asleep.  Did you talk about...  Remember the days when people said, computer at home?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Why?  You need a whole garage just to, you know, have one. 
[01:33:30]  Your equipment is giant.  It's giant, and you need, like, big, huge trucks to deliver to your home.  It'll never catch on.  And they got those spinning wheels behind the glass and the lights that beep and buzz.  Who can afford the electricity to run the system?  Come on.  Yeah.  It was tough for me to call in.  It was too light, too, by the way, about people not buying new cars.  I mean, most people just go out and splurge 13 grand on a car with 88,000 miles.  It was 95, it was 77, and you know how nice that car was, okay? 
[01:34:00]  It does ride nice with all its older little amenities.  But, Voss, what?  Because I've got to repeat the line, though.  So we're talking about this new technology, and so it was Dan from Hoboken said,  well, you know, Ken Stevens' theory on radio is like Richard Voss' theory on comedy.  Who needs to write new material?  Oh, that's funny.  I can't really trash that guy, Dan, because he's a funny guy.  Then again, if I sat in the house all day and thought of jokes, I'd be funny, too.  I have a life.  No, you wouldn't be.  Okay.  Hey, I don't know if you told you about it, but, Dan, your band, you guys sounded great the other night. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, thank you.  I'm telling you.  And speaking of new stuff, that Chetotol song, I really like that one.  Hey, that was good, too.  How long was that?  Let me go into my albums and see if I can find that one.  That was good.  That's funny.  Can you play a little later at night, maybe at 4 in the morning?  I know.  Do like four more derelicts.  What time did you guys...  Oh, I'm going to go late.  You had to see their dressing room. 
[01:35:00]  Red Foxx had a nicer one at the end of his career.  I was sitting next to the boiler, I think.  Yeah.  Sorry, there's no room for coats in here.  No, it was really good.  You guys sounded really good.  That was fun, man.  And it was good waiting around for that guy.  Now, I thought you said the good rats, but there's only really one guy from the good rats, right?  Right.  So, wouldn't it just be the good rat?  I think that's...  Well, it's one good rat and his son.  Oh, he's the son now?  All the...  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember seeing them like 25 years ago when I was four. 
[01:35:30]  Right.  Good.  All right, Bob.  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  I've got to get back to the trombone.  I'm writing some new stuff.  Oh.  A couple of them worked on the show.  Congratulations.  Oh, no.  That's ad-libbing.  I'm an ad-lib genius.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Let me see.  I'll write down.  Hold on.  Knock, knock.  And then they say, who's there?  And I say, dryer door.  Well, then in parentheses, after 40 minutes, aren't you glad I didn't say banana? 
[01:36:00]  Look, the black guy's eating fried chicken.  My God.  Paul is a funny guy, though, man.  He is the only guy I know that consistently has drinks thrown on him.  Every time I see him, he's like, she threw a drink on me.  He's just such a creep.  I'm coming from you.  That's a compliment. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, great.  Oh, wow.  Look at Paul from Boston.  Maybe the XM will have a whole channel for Elevator from Hell.  Wow.  The guy who didn't eat from Boston.  A little inside joke with Mark there.  All right.  Let's get Kreskin in here.  Ah, Kreskin.  Ken, you can turn off the radio.  We've stopped talking about you.  Let's ask Kreskin some things.  I hate, you know, I hate riding Ken because he's done good by us.  No, I like him.  But this thing is completely ridiculous, and we need to discuss it further off the air. 
[01:37:00]  It's a bigger plan, I'm sure.  There are additional folks here.  Kreskin!  How have you been, Kreskin?  Uh-oh, here it is.  No, no, no, no, no.  Hold on.  Oh, give me a nice hand, Jake.  Oh, God.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  He hits me.  What is...  Kreskin...  Look at what he does.  Do not shake my hand.  Oh, yeah.  No, you have to.  Or I will punch your old baby glasses.  Hold on, Kreskin.  That's more of the Freddie Laker glasses.  Ow!  No, your glasses are huge, my friend. 
[01:37:30]  Look, shake Ovi's hand.  Come on.  Ow!  Ow!  I didn't press you.  I want to tell you something, guys.  If you think this is plain water here, I mean, the aroma here is so...  Oh, it's water.  Yeah, sure, sure.  The other time he says it over and over again, it's water.  Right.  Say it clearly, it's water.  You're making me uncomfortable.  You're way too close.  He's touching you.  He's touching you, Ovi.  Kreskin, your tie has cards on it.  Right.  Did you see that?  He's asking where to go.  With those glasses, you should know. 
[01:38:00]  Kreskin, those are some big glasses.  No, I...  You know what it is?  It's all-seeing.  Through the...  Yeah, all-seeing.  Yes, for all-seeing.  What about great?  It was in New York Magazine.  I just got back from Canada.  We were talking about it.  A guy...  He's all over the place, Gordon.  A guy wrote this article in New York.  He said that I have in the stem of my glasses a miniature radio receiver.  Oh!  And this is why they're so sick.  Wait a minute.  The battery went dead.  Ah, could be.  Could be.  The cards are because...  I guess I've never told this, but Carson, all the years I did the show, his prop man was 
[01:38:30]  Jack Pierce.  And just before I'd go on, Jack would be opening the card and take a Jack card, sail it across,  Peter LaSalle would be at the break, catch it, and run on.  And Johnny would do his intro, and I'd walk on, and nobody saw the cards.  If they were hidden behind a vase or something, and we'd go to a break, Johnny would say,  Hey, I'm a sight of humor.  You do what you do with the mind with the cards, and I'd do a separate show when we  are on a break. 
[01:39:00]  And 88 shows...  Be more funny!  Hey, listen.  Did you see...  Oh, oh, oh.  Did you see Newsweek?  Newsweek.  Let me see.  Oh, my God.  I mean...  What about Newsweek?  What's in Newsweek that you have in your briefcase?  Look at that.  Well, no.  Kreskin.  We got the...  The amazing Kreskin.  But, you know, they did research on the predictions to confirm that they were done.  Oh!  Over a year ago.  A year ago, Kreskin made a prediction.  You know, about the war.  And let me see what your quote was.  Two pages in Newsweek. 
[01:39:30]  Could you pass that along, please?  Did you last...  You guys last saw me here?  Let me look at this urgent communique.  No, it's not an urgent communique.  It's just...  Where's that tray?  Newsweek.  Oh, that's not a tray.  You want a tray where everything is visible.  That's...  Oh, my God.  Oh.  You got everything.  And you want to read along a little bit here?  Well, Hollywood's go-to mentalist for more than 40 years.  Of course, that's...  Oh, don't read the article now.  I'm just pawing through it a little.  No, no, no, no.  Apparently foresaw America's war on terrorism. 
[01:40:00]  Right down to the anthrax.  Yeah, we don't want...  We don't...  But, you know, they researched it.  The fact that I did discuss it on CNN.  Yeah.  Along with my statement on New Year's Day that my favorite team, the Yankees, and Mayor  Giuliani, don't get angry at me, where they would not win.  Wow.  I said, that's a 50-50 shot.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a real 50-50 shot.  And so were the other things that I said about the...  Well, we won't go into it.  Twin Towers and everything.  About the two flights and...  Well, you predicted a lot of the stuff that happened in Newsweek. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  And they did a darn good job.  You got a watch there, too?  Kreskin?  You got a watch.  You got a ring.  And you don't have a tray.  I want to go...  All right, wait.  Kreskin, let's set up this little thing you've got to do.  Kreskin, I'm looking at this.  Did you say by September or October there will be two major plane crashes?  Was that what your quote was?  I said in September something would happen regarding two or three airlines.  Kreskin's...  Yeah.  That was on...  Yeah, you got a watch there, too?  Let's get it.  We've got something that's moving time in. 
[01:41:00]  I'm going to try something with you folks, which I think is going to be fascinating.  Oh, my God.  I asked these guys...  Now, wait a minute.  You got to understand.  This is the first time you showed me this.  Talk about ingenuity.  What?  Because I wrote this in quarter...  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Quarter or four this morning.  Wait, yeah.  Tell them what I asked you to do.  Where are we?  I don't know.  Well, I wanted to do something with you guys, and I...  Kreskin, according to Ken Stevens, our listeners are pretty stupid, so we've got to set up...  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, they're not... 
[01:41:30]  Okay.  Now, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Forgive me.  What are we doing?  I need a setup for this because I'm lost.  I'm going to explain how I do what I do.  I'm going to show you right now.  Okay.  What are you doing?  I'm going to do...  I have a theory that I've felt all my life that...  If you want to communicate an idea or you want to create something during the day with the people you have around you,  make a note about it early in the day, carry it on your person,  and sooner or later, something's going to happen to bring it about. 
[01:42:00]  No fortune.  There's nothing to do with fortune telling or psychic phenomena and so forth.  You tend to look for vibes that kind of agree with what you have in mind.  Oh, okay.  All right, so look.  I'm not going to have...  My God, how many items?  One, two, three.  So I asked...  Rick.  To gather...  You should know his name.  No, I wanted Rick to talk.  My God.  He's got an interesting array of stuff here.  Let me pass...  We have a box of items.  Items.  We've got a box of items.  And you're going to do something with the box of items, right? 
[01:42:30]  And you've got some kind of envelope that is sealed over there, right?  Wow, you took care of it in two seconds.  I know.  Pass it around there.  Kreskin, by the way, if you knew what was going on with the September 11th thing,  how about letting everyone else know?  Hey, Kreskin, a phone call, huh?  I did.  Kreskin, a phone call.  How about a page or something?  That's what I did.  An email, Kreskin.  How about skywriting?  Something.  Kreskin, help us out here in New York.  Put the tray in front of...  Put the whole thing in front of them.  Okay.  Oh, I'll put the whole thing in front of me?  Yeah, by the way, right there.  Now, just take something out.  There's such an array of various items here.  Anthony has a box of stuff in front of him. 
[01:43:00]  Why don't you...  Take an item out of it.  Hold on.  I will.  Hold on.  Hold on, Kreskin.  I'm...  I want you...  All I want you to do is just to just...  Hold on.  Can we describe some of the stuff in there?  Yeah.  Watch out.  Can we undescribe it?  Just pull on.  There is a little pink bunny rabbit with a huge junk on it.  There's a baseball wrapped in rubber bands, a little car, the Shrek Black Earl thing.  Oh, that'd be nice.  A couple of action figures, sunglasses, a watch, some change, a button, a beeper, matches, 
[01:43:30]  keys, a watch.  So, some box of junk.  So, some random items that you ask Rick to put in a box.  Can I be heard by pointing out some of the items?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, grab on Norton's mic for a minute.  He's not saying anything today.  All right.  You know, we need room in front of you.  So, how about taking a few items out?  You know, different times.  How many?  Ah, just take a few items.  A few items.  Okay.  You know, go ahead.  Different items, different things. 
[01:44:00]  Not all the same thing.  There's nothing the same in the box.  And you decide when you've finished taking...  You decide when you've finished and you can take it...  Tell me when you've decided you're finished taking things out.  I am finished.  All right.  Now, listen...  All right, watch this guy's hand.  By the way, let me tell you something.  Okay.  I said I wanted everything different.  We've got a couple of items exactly...  I mean, we've got two figures.  So, let's just get rid of one of these things.  Just throw one away.  Just throw one of these away.  No, it's just Earl.  Okay.  All right.  Get rid of the...  Now, look.  We've got a pencil. 
[01:44:30]  We've got any money in there.  We've got a coin.  We've got a ring in there.  We've got a...  Is there a watch in there or something?  I took the watch out, Kreskin.  Now, you want to take two or three more items and just put them right out there, too.  And I think that'll do it.  I just want to get a pair of numbers.  Okay.  Be as far as much variety.  Beeper, I'll take the...  No, I don't want the ring.  I want the keys.  That's all I'm taking, Kreskin.  Now, guys, I've got to show you something. 
[01:45:00]  I feel I was forced to take more items.  Oh, come back then.  Change it with something else.  Go on.  Change it with something else.  No, you know something?  I didn't want to take the keys or the beeper.  All right.  Put the keys and the beeper back.  I want these items.  That's all I want, Kreskin.  Oh, you thought he was tricking you.  I felt like I was being forced to take a couple of more items than I wanted.  All right.  Very good.  You've only got one, two, three, four, five.  He's got five items in front of him, Kreskin.  Now, listen, guys.  He's got a baseball that's wrapped up in rubber bands.  This isn't TV, Kreskin.  This isn't Carson, so we've got to explain some stuff here.  I understand.  A book of matches. 
[01:45:30]  What's that, Ed?  Leather wristband.  Leather wristband.  That's a watch.  And that's a watch.  That's all right.  And a model car.  Okay.  Is that a Miata?  That's a Ferrari.  You know, I wanted more, but that's okay.  Put your hand on one of them.  Your hand palm down on just one of them.  Either hand, and then with the...  Just put the palm down.  And with the other hand, put it on something else.  Just put it on the other.  Look at how his hand's moving.  All right.  Push him forward.  Good.  Push him forward.  Now, listen.  Now, listen to me very carefully.  I want you to close your eyes. 
[01:46:00]  Take your hands away.  Yes.  Take your hands away.  Now, he could have taken...  There had to be about 18, maybe 22 items there.  I don't know exactly how many.  He could have taken...  I want him to take more out.  You will agree, Anthony, he didn't want to take more.  In fact, he switched them back in.  Open your eyes.  Yes.  Now, this time, put your hands palm up.  One on each item.  Palm up.  Oh.  Palm up.  New items?  Yeah.  New items.  Now, listen to me.  All right.  Put your hands...  Keep your hands...  Close your eyes.  Uh-oh.  When I count to three... 
[01:46:30]  Mm-hmm.  Can I say what...  He's got his hand on the watch...  I don't even know what he's going on.  What's he going on?  And watch and what...  And let the breath...  Step over here.  Step over here.  All right.  Step over here.  Okay.  I've got to tell you guys something, by the way.  And I don't want him to see this yet.  Yeah, my eyes are closed.  His eyes are closed, right?  I did this...  Oh, I don't even know what time in the morning.  And I put it in a pay envelope like this.  I don't even want anyone to see what it is.  All right.  So now you're taking something out of the envelope.  As I'm talking to you.  Yeah.  Can you hear me, Obi?  Anthony, yes.  I'm sorry.  Obi, can you hear me over here? 
[01:47:00]  Does he look?  No.  Can you hear me?  Obi, can you hear me?  Yeah.  You say to him, now, and when he says now, you're going to feel your hand starting to  raise off of one of the final two objects.  I don't want to feel anything.  No, no.  Come on.  So what?  I've got to cooperate now.  All right.  Whatever you want to...  So Ian has his eyes closed and his hands over two items.  You want me to say my word now? 
[01:47:30]  And I say now?  Now.  That's it.  Decide.  You decide which hand.  I'm not going to tell you which one.  So Ian's got to lift one of his hands up.  You decide.  Yeah.  All right.  Move it away.  Move it away.  Keep the other hand still.  Move it away.  He lifted the hand off the leather band.  Move your eyes.  Open your eyes.  Move the item away.  Keep your hand on that.  Now, don't take your hand off.  Keep your hand.  All right.  His hand is still on the watch.  Yes.  First of all, the truth of the matter is, and nobody was paying attention, he had 11 items  out in front of him.  He had 12.  He took something away, which was a round wristband. 
[01:48:00]  Right.  True.  The wristband is, finally, he narrowed himself down.  And it's interesting if I could have immobilized him to one item.  You haven't moved your hand from the point you're at now, have you?  No, I have not.  The back of your hand is touching what?  What's it touching?  It is touching the wristwatch.  All right.  Listen, guys.  I don't have 12, 18 cards in here.  First of all, I've got to tell you something.  I didn't even know what he was going to bring in.  I just said, get as many items as possible. 
[01:48:30]  You want to take out the card and just read what I prepared earlier today?  Take it out and just read out loud.  What's it say?  Just watch.  That's what I hit.  Literally hit it.  Literally hit it.  Get out of here.  And I've got to tell you something.  When I did this with Carson, we had 82 items on the table.  And he hit it.  Look.  How did he do that?  I hate that.  No, no, no, no.  But you almost changed your mind. 
[01:49:00]  You almost changed.  And you know you did.  Yes.  Yes, you did.  Yes, you did.  Yes.  Well, I did because, you know, I'm thinking back and forth, Mr. President.  I'm thinking, and then I go, should I lift this?  And I'm like, no, you know something?  He might want me to lift that.  I'm going to lift this one.  And you tricked me.  No, I did not.  Well, you got it.  For some reason, I responded.  Isn't that wild?  Damn question.  Do you know what radio stations all our listeners are tuning into right now?  Oh, my God.  To see what else is out there. 
[01:49:30]  Isn't that fascinating?  But can I tell you something, Anthony?  Can I tell you something, Anthony?  Yes.  I am not joking.  You can ask.  Okay.  We can add 80 items there.  80 items.  We can add 100 items.  And I'll pick out as many as I want.  The only thing is, and I'll be honest with you, I can't explain to you why.  You had two figures, and having two items the same, and also you had a wristband and a  wristwatch, which were both bands.  Right.  The images could have been the same.  I could have blown it, but it worked anyway.  I wrote that down at quarter or four this morning. 
[01:50:00]  I've got to tell you something.  Keep the card in the envelope.  I don't know.  Why do you have to write it down at four in the morning?  Hey, can I tell you something we talked about a few days ago?  No, I'm interrupting you guys.  What if this didn't work?  I'm stunned.  I don't know how.  I'm stunned.  You would have had your...  Let me see that.  There's some kind of trickery involved here, Anthony.  There's not trickery involved.  And I would have pulled that out.  No, psychologically.  There was no trickery involved.  It says watch.  Oh, yeah.  It's a Kreskin card.  A little embossed Kreskin card.  I might keep this Kreskin as a souvenir.  I wrote that at quarter or four this morning. 
[01:50:30]  What the hell were you doing up?  I didn't go to bed last night.  I swear to God.  Hey, I go like sometimes.  Hey, people are really freaking out on the phone lines.  That is amazing.  Gail, what's up?  Gail, Gail, Gail, what's up?  Make him shut up, please.  Oh, my God.  That is the longest set up for the worst trick in the world.  You know something?  I am stunned and amazed by what you have just done here.  Did we explain the joke well enough for the kids?  Joke?  That was an amazing thing.  There were various items. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  You know something?  Regardless of how, who, what, or where, I narrowed it down to one.  Yeah.  The watch.  And he pulls out of a medulla envelope.  Anthony, by the way, I could have done it in another room so long as I had a monitor on you  and could see how you were responding.  The reason I had Obi talk to you.  Yeah.  Obi?  One, you were starting to change your mind when I spoke to you.  You really were.  You know, because whenever you're asked to choose something,  I always go back and forth. 
[01:51:30]  Of course.  It's human nature.  You sure did this.  Oh, my God.  You sure did this.  Why don't you see what I haven't bought in a little while.  I'm going to do something, guys, in a little while that I'd like all the listeners to try.  Oh, it's something they can play along with at home.  I think it's something that might get some press coverage, some stories done.  But can I, I give them time.  If you guys are driving, you guys or gals are driving a car, don't do this unless you pull over to the side.  You guys at home, you have a glass of water. 
[01:52:00]  And I'm going to need somebody somewhere in this building that's not in this room.  And let's give ourselves maybe eight times.  You've got someone in mind you're going to go to?  Not really.  Didn't you say you're people in here?  We were going to do this by remote.  I would almost like to do it with someone outdoors.  Well, Kreskin, does it have to be a gentleman at home?  A lady or a gentleman?  If you're at home, a glass of water.  Yeah, but I'd like, I'd like, I'd like Rick to find someone.  Rich? 
[01:52:30]  Rich, why don't you go outside?  No, seriously.  Seriously, Rich.  But they've got to hear me clearly.  Find someone.  If you go outdoors, this is going to sound crazy, they've got to be able to see the sky.  I don't mean signs all over the place.  I mean the sky.  Otherwise, you've got to be able to bring them inside with a glass of water in front of them.  And I need to be able to hear them.  And I want to tell you something, guys.  Because you're going to get scores and scores of people that will get the same response as this person does.  So after we take this break, we'll do this trick. 
[01:53:00]  Trick?  Trick?  A test?  It's a test.  Opie, are you insane?  Here comes Kreskin to beat up Opie.  They're not tricks.  Kreskin is a mentalist.  Kreskin is a mentalist.  I'm hiring this guy.  I like Kreskin.  Ow!  Why do you feel you have to beat people up?  Something tells me when you were a kid, you took a lot of that.  Now you give it back.  No, no, no.  I'm a mentalist.  I'm predicting an ass-kicking in school today.  All right.  So we're doing some type of mental test after a break. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  With cell phones and glasses of water.  People looking at the skies.  Right?  Don't anybody do this driving.  Please.  Well.  Oh, God forbid.  No, no, no.  Seriously.  Can't you even be like, give some kind of a mental thing to Osama to have him run out in a tutu in front of our troops or something?  My dream.  Are we on the air now?  We are on the air.  My dream is to shake hands.  I'd like to shake hands with bin Laden just four seconds before he kicks the bucket.  I would have a great joy in my life.  Oh, to shit.  Why would you shake his head? 
[01:54:00]  Well, the way you shake it, that probably would kill him.  That would dare be if he would get the sights off his head.  He would go faster, isn't he?  I'm sure, Kreskin.  Okay.  Well, we'll come back.  All right, guys.  And we will do this test that Kreskin has that you two at home can participate in.  I can mention where they can get the book.  Oh, of course, Kreskin.  Get the plug in.  What's that book?  Give the title where they can get it.  Kreskin's Future with the Stars.  And you guys, by the way, I'm going to leave this with you, but right now you can get it on  Amazon.com and Kreskin.com, and it will be in the stores, as Newsweek points out in just 
[01:54:30]  a couple of weeks.  But Kreskin.com, Amazon.com, it's Future with the Stars.  All right, so Kreskin is coming back.  And I'm with two stars right now.  Ah, thank you, Kreskin.  A mental test coming up next.  All right.  And you can do it home, Anthony.  Yes.  With water and stuff.  Get ready.  96.5 WCMF.  Now back to Opie and Anthony on 96.5 WCMF, Rochester, New York.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:55:00]  Crystal Method, busy child.  I think they do know.  The amazing Kreskin in the studio.  Amazing everyone.  Michael Brooklyn writes, wow, Kreskin was amazing.  That was the greatest visual trick I ever heard on the radio.  That, that, that.  There's not parts that we correct you, everybody would.  Listen, guys.  But don't forget to mention the book.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Kreskin's book.  Would this be the David Blaine book?  No, no, that's a mad, that's an escape artist.  Kreskin with the stars.  Future with the stars. 
[01:55:30]  Future with the stars.  At Kreskin.com and Amazon.com.  We got to go to the phones, Kreskin, okay?  Jay, Jay, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's happening?  Hey.  How's it going?  Hey, Kreskin, all right, I'm outside.  I'm looking up at the sky.  I got my glass of water.  What do I do here?  All right, hold on.  Hey, you're a little ahead of us there, Jay.  You know what?  You're right.  You need to do some setup, I'm sure.  So you got the water and you're looking up at the sky?  Well, that's what I'm supposed to do, right?  I'm out on my porch here.  You're not driving, right?  He doesn't want anyone driving.  No.  No, I'm not driving. 
[01:56:00]  Jay, you've got a glass of water in your hand?  I do.  It's about three quarters full.  Jay, forget the glass of water.  Hold on.  Yeah, go ahead.  Can you see the sky from where you are?  I can.  Okay, put the glass of water down.  Okay.  Wait, we're doing it now?  Are we doing it now?  You want to do it now?  We're not doing it now.  We're not doing it.  We've got to let everybody know also that they can play along at home.  Get a glass of water.  And do they have to be outside, Crescent?  No.  If you're in a car, just get out of your car and stand outside.  But if you're in the house, just get a glass of water. 
[01:56:30]  If you're in Chelsea, is it okay to have a glass of heel juice?  No, no, no.  And by the way, the glass should not be a busy glass.  It's got to be a clear glass.  I got a clear glass.  No, we don't need the glass.  Kill the glass.  If you're outdoors, you don't need the glass.  If you're outside, you don't need the glass.  If you're inside, you need the glass.  All right.  All right.  I got you.  Hey, Crescent, with those glasses, can you see other galaxies?  Can I put them on?  Oh, you didn't hear.  I'll see what you did, Opie.  I was just in Canada.  Hold on, Jay.  We're going to go back to you. 
[01:57:00]  Paul, I don't want to hear your Canada story.  All right.  Keith, the cop.  What's going on, fellas?  How are you?  All right, Keith.  You know, the tricks are absolutely amazing.  I have to say.  That trick.  Tess.  Tess, I'm sorry, Mr. Crescent.  But, you know, I'm sure you remember this, because about a year and a half, you and I  were playing blackjack at the same table in Atlantic City.  I don't remember.  I'm sorry.  You don't remember.  I'm sorry.  But you lost about $2,500, and I'm just curious.  By the way, by the way, can I just say something?  I have never in my life, as long as I've lived on Earth, lost $2,500, $1,500, $1,000, $500. 
[01:57:30]  That's all right, but if you remember that, then you were with another person.  Oh, no.  That was not Crescent.  Keith, you're a liar.  It was the amazing Crescent.  We sat there, and then he did take a job.  It might have been the amazing Jonathan.  He took us out for sandwiches after it was on his comp, because I played for three hours  He sat down for 15 minutes.  Do you remember what casino it was at?  I got rid of him, Craig.  He's obviously lying. 
[01:58:00]  Obviously lying to you.  He's just misreads of lying.  Michael, what's up?  Michael.  Michael.  Obi.  Hey, Crescent.  Bright light.  It's O-P.  Not a B.  It's a P.  O-P.  Did you think about that yourself?  No.  Is that what your name is?  O-P?  No.  Wow, man.  I know.  You even asked these guys twice if they were on the air.  Are you there, man, or what?  Did you lose your mind in some magic trick, or what, pal?  See, see, pal.  Hey, Michael.  Listen, guys.  Michael, I'm trying to read your thoughts, but I'm dozing, so keep going. 
[01:58:30]  You're right.  See, Crescent's mind is so full of being a mentalist.  Thank you, O-P.  It's very interesting.  That's it.  See how full it is?  He can't.  Whoa.  Don't sweat.  You got it.  The guy's out there.  Bottom line is a fossil of more stuff that he's got, man.  I mean, it's Alzheimer's setting.  Oh, thank you, Michael.  I apologize.  That's all right.  No, no.  The guy's got class.  You can see the lifestyle elite.  I want to do this trick.  O-B, continue with your thought over there. 
[01:59:00]  I was saying his mind is always working, so, you know, some of the smaller details have  to slip through the cracks.  Like my paycheck.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God, if that happened, I'd do it.  All right.  All right, guys.  All right.  Kreskin.  Should we do this?  I want to do this test.  Should we send, is he ready to go out there?  Yeah.  Is he out there right now on the phone, Nick?  Nick?  Yeah.  Is he out there?  I don't know.  What's going on? 
[01:59:30]  Where's the guy with the phone?  Outside?  No, no.  We have somebody on the phone from home.  Wait.  No, no, no.  You were outside with the guy, weren't you?  Oh, the mic.  No, I was going to go out.  Go out now.  All right, Kreskin.  Go out there.  The guy who was supposed to go out with the phone is right in front of you, so he can't  be outside.  You said you were going out and finding someone.  He was the one that you said to go outside, so if he's not outside, you would have known  that because you're looking right out.  Wait, wait, wait.  I understand why Kreskin's a little confused with this, because we have Jay on the phone.  He called and said he is waiting outside. 
[02:00:00]  But you assume that.  But Jay's Jay and not Nick.  He assumed that Dick here was outside already.  It's Dick.  Well, we know Dick is here.  Hurry, Dick.  Does Dick always work this fast?  All right.  Yeah, there he goes.  So there goes Mitch with the phone.  That was Dick.  No, I like the idea it's Rick, and Richard's with him, both in one person.  Right.  Exactly.  How long has he worked for you?  Why don't you tell us? 
[02:00:30]  It's been a couple of years.  He's a good guy.  Hold on.  He's overtired.  He's had a lot of turkey.  You know, Brian wants to say a few words here.  By the way, turkey doesn't make a question.  Oh, Brian, yes.  Kreskin, can you make yourself disappear?  Yes.  Yes.  I apologize.  It's a loser.  All right.  Listen, Kreskin.  Well, that's Mr. Kreskin.  Kreskin.  I don't think everyone has digested their turkey.  They're a little uptight.  My God.  I apologize for Brian.  No, no.  Turkey has a soporific effect anyway.  Yes.  You can tell by the rest of the staff here. 
[02:01:00]  Our friend on the left here, look at the relaxed state that he's in right now.  That's Opie.  That's Jim, isn't it?  Opie, look over here.  Yeah, that's Jim.  I said, Opie, look over here.  And then, look over here.  Kreskin is truly amazing.  And turkey does not make a time.  You have called everything.  Yes, it does.  It does.  Mark Meat does.  At this point, he has called everyone in the room Opie.  Kreskin is amazing.  And if you say turkey, take a hanky and try to get a girl in a car with it, it doesn't work.  Well, it doesn't make you turkey. 
[02:01:30]  The reason why he knows that is he's tried it so many times.  He's got to give up trying that.  He looked at Jim and said.  It's frustrating after a while.  Look at Opie over here.  Oh, relax.  Okay.  Look, I want to do this test.  All right.  Guys, here's what we're going to do.  You guys.  It's a trick.  No, it's a test.  You guys at home, or gals at home, you'll need a glass of water if you're inside.  If you're outdoors, just have a car on the side.  No.  Oh.  And make sure you can look in the sky.  And how do we find out when our friend who's left here and gone downstairs.  Oh, man.  And what's the name of the friend that just left? 
[02:02:00]  Well, let's see.  It was Richard.  It was Arthur.  And then it became Greg.  And what have you.  Dick, yeah.  But at one point.  It's Dick.  I thought it was Rich.  What's really his name?  You need to change his name to Rich, but I don't know.  No, what's his real name?  I don't know.  What is it?  What is it?  You had it right the first time.  I know.  It isn't Rich.  No.  But anyway, is Dick down there?  Whoever it is.  He should be very shortly.  Rick, I don't understand why he isn't calling up because I really want to do this.  Yeah, we've got to do this.  It's going to be amazing.  Once again, the trick as people get rid of it. 
[02:02:30]  The test.  The test.  The test.  The test.  The test.  The test.  The OP.  OPI.  What do people need to do as we wait for Rick to call?  They need, first of all, if they've got a glass of water, just put it on a table in  front of them so they can be sitting, looking straight ahead of the glass of water.  If they're outdoors, they need to find a point in the sky where there's nothing busy  around.  Signs or lights or what have you.  Just look at the sky.  Yeah, just look at the sky.  And meanwhile, while we're...  No, what I was telling you guys is I was doing a nighttime TV talk show a couple weeks 
[02:03:00]  ago.  Oh, Ron is on the phone now.  Oh, he's there.  Okay.  All right, Ron.  Okay.  What's going on, Ron?  Ron.  Ron.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Ron?  Yeah, it's Larry down here.  I'm down here with Foundry Fred.  And we're trying to find somebody.  Nobody wants to go on the air so far.  My God, are they frightened?  Come on.  We've been asking around.  A bunch of people have said no so far.  Pick a...  Is there a security guy?  Oh, no.  That could be pre-arranged.  I might know somebody there.  Right. 
[02:03:30]  Anybody you see.  Pick a policeman that's coming by.  All right.  I'll call you back in a minute as soon as I get somebody nailed down.  Hold on.  Stay on the phone.  All right.  That's interesting.  All right.  Hold on.  You got a cop.  They're not busy in New York these days.  Excuse me.  Do you like to go on the radio?  No, I don't know if it's...  No, it's just for Creskin.  The Amazing Creskin.  You'll have to do a trick.  I don't know if he means Creskin.  All right.  Who?  What's your name?  What?  Person there?  No, she doesn't know who the Amazing Creskin is.  That's all right.  Let me tell you.  Good.  What part of the world are you from? 
[02:04:00]  I think she just can't walk.  All right.  Hold on.  Because Greg wants to say something to Creskin.  Yes, Greg.  Do you have something for Creskin?  Yeah.  The only test he's performing is a test of my patience to listen to the damn radio.  Well, we have to get Rich to get somebody that's going to play a lot.  All right.  Thank you, Greg.  Thank you, Greg.  I apologize for that, Mr. Creskin.  No, don't apologize.  All right.  I got a girl.  Oh, thank God.  Nice.  Does he need to know her name?  Well, let's...  Yes, let's have her name.  Just put her on the phone.  Okay.  Here's Lillian. 
[02:04:30]  Videotaping me?  Lillian.  Lillian.  He said I was going to be on the radio.  Lillian, are you there?  Lillian, are you there?  Hello?  Is this Lillian?  Hello?  Lillian, can you hear me?  Yes.  Is this amazing Creskin?  Creskin, how are you, Lillian?  Good.  How are you doing tonight?  Now, let me ask you this.  Okay.  Are you coming from work?  Are you visiting the city?  Just leaving work.  Just leaving work.  Yes.  Lillian, I've not met you before, right?  I don't believe so.  I didn't know who you were, so...  Good.  Good.  Now, listen to me, Lillian.  Listen to me.  Yeah.  I don't have anything in my hands.  I don't have playing cards. 
[02:05:00]  Anybody, Opie and Anthony are here watching, and I just don't have anything.  Can you pick a point in the sky where you're not looking at signs or activity around that  would distract you?  That you can kind of just pick a point in the sky.  Tell me when you've got some.  Got it?  Okay.  Got it, Lillian?  All right.  By the way, you're not facing traffic right now, are you?  I'm sort of facing traffic, yeah.  Isn't it to your left right now?  It's right in front of me.  Okay.  Now, look at the sky.  Listen to me.  Okay. 
[02:05:30]  Do you play cards at all?  A little.  All right.  Now, look at the sky.  Listen.  You're going to see, and so are you folks listening in at home and people standing by their  car outside, Lillian, you look in the sky, you're going to see a panorama of playing  cards in your mind's eye, and you're going to finally narrow yourself down to one card.  Listen to me.  One card.  Lillian, can you hear me?  Yes, I can.  Look in the sky.  No matter what anybody says to you, keep looking in the sky. 
[02:06:00]  No matter how many cards you see, tell us what you're finding.  And I'm not trying to force you to pick the most popular card, Ace of Spades.  That's child's play.  Any one of 52 cards, tell me what you decided upon.  You tell us out loud.  Right now?  Yes.  Jack of Spades.  I've got to ask you something.  That wasn't the first choice, was it?  Yeah, it was.  All right.  Listen to me.  Jack of Spades.  Now, wait a minute.  Wait a minute, guys.  And by the way, the fellow that handed you the phone did not say anything to you. 
[02:06:30]  He didn't tell you the name of any cards, did he?  No.  He's not smart enough.  No, no, no.  Nothing was prearranged in that way.  Anthony.  Oh, yes?  On that pail over there is my out of shape case.  No one's going to say I ever came to it.  I want you to go over and pick up that pail.  And just bring it over to your microphone.  Just bring it over to the microphone, if you will.  The whole pail and the briefcase?  The whole briefcase.  The whole briefcase.  So did everyone pick the same card out there, Creskin?  Bring it over there.  Bring it over.  I'm bringing it, Creskin.  Now, lay it down in front of you. 
[02:07:00]  Yes.  All right, now listen to me.  Yes, amazing.  Open.  Mr. Amazing, to you.  By the way, should I just tell you something?  Should I still be looking up?  No, no, no.  Don't look up anymore.  Okay.  Open that out of shape.  You want to tell him where we are from here?  Where the case is from me?  It's about eight feet away from Mr. Creskin.  And it was sitting behind you before.  It was on the garbage can.  It was sitting behind you before.  Yes, yes.  No one has been near you.  All right.  Listen.  I want you to open that out of shape case and tell us everything that's in here.  Everything.  That's it. 
[02:07:30]  Without taking anything, what's in there?  Okay.  I am seeing five marbles in a plastic bag.  I see a deck of cards in a box.  Only one deck of cards, right?  Only one deck of cards.  Only one deck of cards.  And anybody who says this is a sleight of hand, they're going to have to have their head examined  because no one...  Take the deck of cards out.  Take the box out.  Leave the wallet alone.  Creskin's visa.  Close the case.  Close the case.  Close the case.  Now, listen.  Take the deck in your hand.  Yes.  I want you... 
[02:08:00]  Now, by the way, I made it clear to her that she could have thought of any one of 52 cards.  Absolutely.  Take the deck out.  Are other people taking cards out?  No, don't touch you.  Take the deck out.  Higher deck.  Now, listen.  Hold the deck face up so you can see it.  Face up.  Now, you're going to count.  We don't know where the...  What was the card she decided on?  It was the Jack of Spades.  We don't know where the Jack of Spades is in the deck.  So here's what I want you to do, Anthony.  You count, starting with the card facing you, one at a time.  Each time you deal a card off, turn it face down. 
[02:08:30]  Count them out loud until you come to the Jack of Spades.  And when you come to the Jack of Spades, don't turn it face down.  Let us just hear the number it's at.  Hear the number it's at.  Now, she had one of 52 cards.  I'm doing this radius, then.  No, don't say anything.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  One.  And I count one.  Two.  Counting.  Three.  Finding the Jack.  Four.  Five.  One.  One.  One.  One.  Eight.  Nine.  Ten.  Eleven.  By the way, don't catch that. 
[02:09:00]  Is it where you're killed?  Fifteen.  Is it where you're killed?  Seventeen.  Eight.  Nineteen.  Twenty.  Twenty-one.  Twenty-two.  Twenty-three.  Twenty-four.  Twenty-five.  Twenty-six.  Twenty-seven.  Twenty-eight.  Twenty-nine.  You could have thought of any one of 52 cards.  Thirty.  Thirty-one.  Thirty-two.  Thirty-three.  Thirty-four.  Thirty-five.  Thirty-six.  Thirty-seven.  Thirty-eight.  Thirty-nine.  Forty.  My God.  Forty-one.  Forty-two.  Forty-three.  Forty-four.  Forty-five. 
[02:09:30]  Forty-six.  Forty-seven.  Forty-eight.  Forty-nine.  Forty-nine.  Forty-nine.  All right.  Hold on.  One card missing in the Jack.  We did not find the Jack of Spades there.  Your staff saw me.  Is this all not wrong?  Can we believe you this time?  Okay.  Get back to your microphone.  Anthony just counted.  Fifty-one cards.  No Jack of Spades.  Reach in my pocket.  Reach in my pocket.  Yeah.  Which pocket?  Which pocket, Creskin?  Take everything out.  They saw me do this outside.  I just don't want to see the card. 
[02:10:00]  There it is.  The Jack of Spades.  The Jack of Spades.  Creskin.  Put in Creskin's pocket.  Look.  The whole time.  That, I cannot even figure out how the hell you did that.  Wait a minute.  In the box.  In the box.  It worked?  Creskin.  There you go.  Not water.  I can't hear anything.  I'm thinking the girl's in on the trick, and that's how it goes.  No.  Sure.  Why not?  No.  I can't see that.  Why not?  Because Rick went down and just picked up a random person.  Rick? 
[02:10:30]  Right.  Wait.  Get on the mic.  He's getting there.  No.  You've got to establish the fact that we...  Oh, I know Rick.  He went down there and...  Rick.  Put Rick back on the phone.  Rick?  Hey, what happened to, like, looking...  What happened to our gal?  Hey, hey, chick.  Put Rick back on the phone.  Yeah?  Put Rick back on the phone.  Okay, hang on.  Are you Rick?  Are you Rick?  Yeah.  Rick.  Rick.  Yeah.  How did you get that girl? 
[02:11:00]  Me and Steve came down here.  We asked a few people.  She walked up and just kind of stood there.  She was waiting for a guy who just walked up in army fatigue.  I never met her before.  No, I never met her before.  That's amazing.  And...  By the way, you guys have to know, you asked the gal out there, before I came in here,  I said, oh, my God, and I quickly took a card out of the deck and put it in my pocket  and...  No, I hope I can put the jack of spades out.  Oh, you know what I'm thinking, though?  Yeah.  You're...  Too much chance would be taken to have somebody down there because Rick asked a couple of 
[02:11:30]  other people.  No, I know, Kreskin, please.  I completely...  I'm amazed.  No, but no.  I'm stopping trying that he set it up.  He didn't set it up.  No, I'm saying any critic like Opie that is listening and trying to come up with what  he did, a plant is not it.  I don't know how the hell you did that.  But Rick was asking other people, and the idea that one of them might have gone, all  right, do it, I'll do it, it seems a little odd.  And by the way, I want you guys to know, that case...  I saw, Kreskin... 
[02:12:00]  Nobody's going to say I'm in this case.  He was behind me.  It really was.  Yeah, the case was by himself the whole time.  The jack was in the box.  It's impossible.  By the way, that was the first time I had ever done that on a telephone in my career.  I've always done seeing the person.  Kreskin, that was amazing.  Guys, look at me.  You are truly the amazing Kreskin.  By the way...  Hey, Rich.  Yo.  All right, thank you.  I think we're done.  Are we done with it, Rich?  Yeah, thank you.  Tell the gal.  Hey, what about...  She got that jack of spades.  Kreskin.  And I knew...  But everyone else was supposed to do the trick, right? 
[02:12:30]  You had people stop at cars.  Not everyone was going to get the same response, but I hope...  I'd like to see how many people got the card.  I would really like to see it.  Now, by the way, when I did this on a Carson show...  What about the glass of water?  That was to give them a focal point.  Oh.  Let me just tell you something.  Water equals sky, Anthony.  If you don't have sky, such as your water.  Yeah.  She would start thinking in terms of hearts, diamonds, because of red lights, and so forth.  I had to keep her mind away from anything that could influence her, any outside...  Oh, see, we talked about Earl before. 
[02:13:00]  Well, that's why she picked spades.  See?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That's bad.  That's awful.  You're awful.  Where are you going, Kreskin?  No, he's going to beat me up.  Kreskin, ow, ow, ow.  Kreskin, how about you and I in a taint-off?  Ow.  How about...  By the way, how about me and Kreskin in a taint-off, Anthony?  Is that not a dramatic test?  Kreskin, that was amazing.  That was...  Well, listen.  That was amazing.  Sometime in the future, and you gave me your word, we're going to do something that's going  to rock this city.  Oh, yes. 
[02:13:30]  And we'll do it in the future.  No, we promised we'd not discuss it, but it will rock this city.  Yes.  Because it's going to involve the city, and that's all we're going to say.  Great, Kreskin.  Hey, Mike, listen, guys, I'm going to get shoveling off, as Digger O'Dell said years  ago, but I love working with you.  I don't know.  We're just starting to have 45 minutes.  Time goes by.  Time flies when Kreskin's here.  Kreskin, and you can get his book, Amazing Kreskin's Future with the Stars, at Amazon.com  and Kreskin.com.  Kreskin, always a pleasure.  Thank you so much for showing up.  We're coming back for a special. 
[02:14:00]  You are truly amazing.  Thank you.  You and I in a taint-off next time you come here, right?  A taint-off.  Take care, guys.  I'll see you again.  Kreskin, thank you.  I have some illusions I could do myself.  That is amazing.  I have no clue how that was done.  There he goes, the amazing one.  Thank you.  There he goes, a puff of smoke, and he just vanishes.  He is truly amazing.  Like the great kazoo.  Yes.  I was downstairs telling Billy that I enjoyed working here, or Oscar.  No, I'm sorry.  Right.  Sam, Pete, Bob.  You knew his name all the time. 
[02:14:30]  Kreskin, there he goes, the amazing Kreskin.  All right, dude.  How do you do that?  That was amazing.  No, it wasn't.  It wasn't.  Why?  Dude, how?  How?  The girl's the plan.  I don't believe it.  Stop it.  Because it did...  Ant's right.  There was too many...  Too much of a chance.  Rick couldn't...  Too much of a chance.  Anybody...  It could have been...  That he would have grabbed somebody else.  Or a guy.  Say, what do you think?  Girl, it was a plan?  Well, I don't know.  I didn't hear the bit, but I mean, she was just some random chick sitting on the street  waiting for her boyfriend. 
[02:15:00]  That was...  It was totally random.  We asked, like, four or five people before her.  See, that's it.  You can't have four or five people.  What if someone said, yeah, what the F, man?  I'll do it.  Hey.  What about...  What if all four or five people were in on the gang?  No.  I don't think so.  No, somebody else could have been walking in the office.  This is an office building.  That's the only reason I'll say no.  And where's he going to get four or five people that just follow him around when he does one trick  like that?  Is that it?  Well, he's got a lot of money.  Yeah, but is that what he does?  No, I can't.  I...  I don't know.  Rick, Rick, you saw the chick. 
[02:15:30]  I saw the chick.  How did you find her?  What was she doing?  Did she look like she belonged there?  Did it...  She looked like she was coming from work, and she was just kind of standing there for no  reason, we thought.  And then all of a sudden, some guy in fatigues came walking up with a bouquet of flowers, handed  them to her, and while she was on the phone with you guys, she's like, hold on, hold  on, hold on.  And give the guy a kiss or whatever.  I heard her, like, talking over.  Now, you were downstairs by the Brooklyn Diner.  Yeah.  See, now, how would he know that they didn't go out the other door and go to the other 
[02:16:00]  side by the parking garage or by Hooters that was outside?  I mean, this is very, very perplexing to me.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, guys, I swear to God, I thought of that exact same card a split second before that  chance.  Well, you know something, you're going to get people that think of every card in the  deck.  Yeah.  Some of you are going to think of the thing.  Well, let's ask the guy that called Jay, who was waiting outside with a glass of water.  Jay.  O and A.  What card did you pick?  Tell Forskin he owes me $30 for my heating bill. 
[02:16:30]  Queen of hearts.  You picked the queen of hearts?  The queen of hearts, the three of clubs, I got a few cards, but not the jack of spades.  All right.  Maybe you weren't focused enough.  I focus very hard, but I, whatever.  I'm not from standing outside freezing my ass off.  Frank, you're next to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I'm no longer a doubter.  Kreskin is amazing.  He's making your ratings disappear.  I do have an idea of what he may have done, though.  All right.  What? 
[02:17:00]  You should have asked him to, you know, pat him down for other face cards, because I  think most people pick face cards, and I bet you he had more than one card on him.  Dude, I took the deck out of his briefcase.  The briefcase was sitting on that pail when the girl said the card name.  I got to tell everyone, you know, since the last visit by Kreskin, we've all been looking  around a lot more.  Right.  And that briefcase definitely...  It was sitting behind Norton, and Kreskin wasn't near.  He couldn't get it to.  She said jack of spades.  I picked up the case. 
[02:17:30]  Kreskin was not near me.  I took the box of cards out of his briefcase and counted off, and the jack was not in the  deck.  It was 51 cards in the deck of the jack, and he had the jack.  Yeah.  And he actually pulled it out of his shirt pocket.  All right, guys.  I'm going to make myself disappear.  All right.  There he goes.  Because even if he had different face cards stored in different pockets, there was still  one of the jack missions.  There's too much left to chance with that, even.  Rich, what's up?  Hey.  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  All right.  I know how he did it. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, right?  It's called sleight of mouth.  It's not sleight of hand.  He put an embedded command into the girl.  Okay?  When he talked about the eighth of spades, that already got her focused on the spade card.  And if you review the tape carefully, there's going to be something that he said that would  force her or kind of coerce her into picking the jack.  Too much left to chance.  I studied this stuff, guys.  I thought of that, too.  I thought of that, too, because he mentioned spades and she picked spades.  But what if she would have picked the three of clubs? 
[02:18:30]  There was too much left to chance.  There's no way.  You know Tony Robbins, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's handsome.  Okay.  This guy is the king of sleight of mouth.  I mean, everything he does is about this.  And I studied with a guy who was his, you know, mentored unto him.  No, it's too much to chance.  It's so easy.  He can have you say, I suck porcupines, donk.  You know, donk.  Yeah.  He can get you to do that.  Trust me.  All right.  Thank you, Rich.  I don't buy it.  You know, if he was doing that, then he is truly effing amazing. 
[02:19:00]  How do you make a girl say yes?  Luke, what's up?  I picked the jack of spades, too.  You picked the jack of spades?  Swear to God, I'm driving down the frigging highway outside of Philly,  and I'm looking up at the sky.  I know he told us not to do it, but I'm looking at the sky,  and I picked the jack of spades, too.  All right.  Well, I can take phone calls from a lot of people that did not pick the jack of spades.  You probably could, you know.  Pretty much by chance.  All right.  Thank you.  Let me go to Ryder.  Ryder, what's up?  Ryder. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Go ahead real fast.  Oh, hey.  The guys just told you how they did it.  It's called Providence.  People are likely to pick the same cards.  There's maybe three or four.  It's not a coincidence that everyone's calling you saying they picked the jack of spades.  There's maybe three or four cards people picked.  Not everyone's calling us saying that, and it was the jack of spades.  It was jack of spades.  All right.  Thank you.  They just removed those cards from the deck and put in dupes.  Thank you, Ryder.  What?  I don't know.  Put in dupes.  Too much left to chance. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The only logical thing, like Eric says on line eight, he flooded the street with people.  He had four or five out there, and now you've got five guys that have to get to the guy with  the phone.  That's it.  There could have been other cards missing from that deck.  You were just looking for the jack of spades.  The deck might have been stuffed.  I have the deck right here.  He left it.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did. 
[02:20:30]  Give me that deck.  Okay, Steve.  He left it.  He put the jack back in, and he left it.  He wouldn't have left it, at least.  Fine deck.  Without a deck.  Oh, come on.  Stop it.  Because I was thinking to myself, were there picture cards in that deck?  Am I crazy?  Now there are 52.  The jack of spades is right on top.  I got Creskin's deck.  This is a magic deck.  What does it do?  Do magic. 
[02:21:00]  Fly cards.  It seems that all the cards are here.  The only logical thing is the girl was in on the trick.  That would be the only logical thing, but again, there's too much left to chance.  And then you plug the street with a bunch of people.  Why not?  Five or six people.  So now you've got five or six people, and their job is to get to Rick with the phone.  Make it look like it's not obvious.  Somebody might spill the beans.  He's got a reputation.  Rick, are you planning this trick?  No. 
[02:21:30]  No, Rick, wouldn't.  Not now.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony?  We're going to go to the F.U. line.  The amazing Creskin.  He is amazing.  All right.  Boring stuff.  Amazing.  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the opiate Anthony F.U. line.  Hey, this is Bobby Bigger.  I want to put a big F.U. out there.  Every one of these piece of s*** car drivers out there think you can come around the right  side of the tractor trail on an on-ramp.  And, Rick, I'm not going to push you into a guardrail.  But you know what?  F.U.  Try it one more time.  Next message.  This is a big F.U. for all my pharmacy customers. 
[02:22:00]  You know what?  I don't know where the f***ing milk is.  I went to school for six years.  I know where the pills are.  Not the f***ing milk.  Have a good day.  Bye.  Next message.  I want to leave a big, screaming F.U. to Paul.  I can't remember my f***ing birthday.  F***ing man.  Next message.  Hi, this is Nikki.  And I'm originally from Queens, New York.  And I'd like to give an F.U. to everybody who went to P.S. 91 with me.  All the guys, anyway. 
[02:22:30]  Because I'm 19 now.  And I am so hot.  I work at Hooters.  I just haven't lost it for Playboy.  So I just want to say F.U. to all of you.  And you'll never get with this.  End of message.  All this week with Opie and Anthony, it's Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  So, if you're a mommy, call now.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony on 96.5 WCMN, Rochester, New York.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:23:00]  I'm not damn impressed with that.  This happens every time that guy comes in.  We spend the entire break on, no, it's this way.  And then we come up with another idea.  And Opie accuses us of being insane.  I figured out.  Did I figure out the other two, most likely?  Most likely.  Is my explanation pretty good?  Your explanation for this one still leaves the chance an F-up.  All right, let me...  No way!  Let me explain what I think happened with the Kreskin trick. 
[02:23:30]  Anthony, within 20 seconds, just explain the whole trick in case people are tuning in.  All right, Kreskin got somebody...  Rick went downstairs with a cell phone.  He picked a random person walking around.  Right.  From one of the streets here in New York City.  Right.  Um, Kreskin got on the phone with that person, told them to pick a random card.  Look up in the sky, and with your mind's eye, see a deck of cards.  Pick a random card.  She picked the jack of spades. 
[02:24:00]  Kreskin then told me to look at the garbage pail behind Norton.  On top of that pail was Kreskin's briefcase.  That no one touched.  That much we know.  Right.  We can tell you what we know.  I saw the briefcase the whole time.  He was over there.  It was there before the girl said jack of spades.  No one can mess with the briefcase.  We're all in agreement there, right?  Right.  As we move forward.  Okay, continue with the trick.  So Kreskin told me to get up, grab the briefcase, bring it over to me.  So I grabbed it.  He told me to open it.  He said, what's inside? 
[02:24:30]  I named a couple of things, and then I said, and a deck of cards.  It is a box of cards, and it is open.  Okay.  So he told me to take the cards out and look at them face up and count off one, two, three,  four, five, until I hit the jack of spades.  I never hit the jack of spades.  There were only 51 cards in that deck, and none of them were the jack of spades.  And the deck...  Kreskin had what?  And the deck was with you the whole time after you took it out of the briefcase.  Kreskin didn't come close to you, none of that. 
[02:25:00]  The jack of spades was in Kreskin's breast pocket.  And I am at a loss to how he did this.  Now, Opie, your explanation on how he was able to pull this off.  I'm changing my theory now, though.  Why?  If you had 52 cards on them, and he told you where to go because he knew where his card was.  Various, but that doesn't explain the one missing card in this deck was the jack of spades.  Gotcha.  Okay. 
[02:25:30]  All right, this is what I think.  Okay.  Now, Kreskin is going on a national radio show that is soon going to be competing with satellite radio.  And he can't be wrong.  He can't be.  It would not be good for his reputation to be wrong with any of his tricks on the Opie and Anthony show.  That's why people throw away your suggestion, your statistics, your this, that, the other thing.  It has to be 100% for Kreskin.  You can't leave it to, he said spades before the girl picked the spade card, so that way. 
[02:26:00]  Now, you cannot then turn around and have Kreskin go, well, I don't have something for the three of hearts.  She was supposed to pick the jack of spades.  He can't leave anything to chance.  Right.  That much we know.  This has to be full proof.  And, for example, because a lot of people say, well, he said the ace of spades just before the girl talked,  and now he's, you know, a suggested gesture.  What if he said the ace of hearts?  Right.  But Kreskin's screwed.  How about this as far as leaving things to chance?  What about at that point when he was supposed to say ace of spades? 
[02:26:30]  Phone craps out.  Ambulance goes by.  Whatever.  Right.  Too much to chance.  He can't chance anything.  Yeah.  Okay?  He needs that girl to pick the jack of spades because that's how the trick is set up.  Jack is in the briefcase, deck of cards in the briefcase, missing the jack of spades.  Jack of spades already on his person.  Right.  The trick is set up.  So now you have to think, okay, this girl, in my opinion, has to be a plant.  That's what Pope's theory is.  Now there's some chances that you take with plants. 
[02:27:00]  Because he did tell Rick to just find someone on the street.  Rick had a tough time at first.  Okay?  Now, just regular schmoes could have walked up to Rick.  Definitely.  Kreskin knows the names of his plants.  Doesn't know any of the names of the people in the studio, which might have thrown us off, by the way.  Just to throw us off and say, look, he's a senile old F.  To me, still leaves too much to chance.  So he knows one of his plants is Lily. 
[02:27:30]  Maybe she was the only one.  I don't know.  But I'm assuming he had a plan at the exits for the building.  Okay.  There's an army, a Kreskin army.  Maybe not an army, but three or four people that he happens to know in New York that helps him out with tricks.  Why not?  How much was she laughing then at Rick on, look at this stupid rube coming up to me.  Now, look at this mark totally taking the bait and coming up to me, the plant.  Now, if we go with the theory that we can't leave anything to chance, because I think it's very important, okay? 
[02:28:00]  Kreskin needs the plant to talk to Rick.  Right.  Okay.  Let's say another guy, a Bob, walks up and goes, I'll do the trick.  Kreskin knows Bob.  Bob's not one of my plants.  That's when he starts messing with us and, you know, maybe he says, well, just in case you guys think that Bob's a plant,  all right, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.  Why don't we, you know, grab another person off the street?  Giving Lillian now a second chance to get to the phone.  What if we go, no, we want Bob. 
[02:28:30]  I don't think Bob's a plant.  No, you use Bob, Kreskin.  Just like me with the briefcase or with the different items when he first came in, he said, no, pick a couple more.  And I'm like, no, these are the ones I want.  Right.  And it still worked.  Right.  You know, if he would have said, Bob, I think Bob's a plant.  Let's move on to someone else.  No, screw you.  This is who we're using.  See?  Too much to chance.  What?  Maybe he has something else he could say.  The plant.  It's the streets of New York City.  You walk out.  All of a sudden, you could pick anybody.  Rick could have picked anybody. 
[02:29:00]  Well, from what we should have had, now that we're looking back at it, we should have had Rick run down the street like a madman.  I was saying that, yeah.  A couple blocks.  Walk out the door.  All of a sudden, he just bolts.  Like, takes off two city blocks, and then finds somebody else.  The plants are just going to happen to be around the area.  And something really weird happened with Lillian on the street.  Someone just happens to hand her flowers or something?  Yeah.  Like, oh, it's just everyday stuff going on in the streets of New York.  No, it was like her date.  She was waiting for this guy.  Waiting for a guy. 
[02:29:30]  It's possible, but the only reason I doubt plants is because he's too famous, and his reputation is too important to all of a sudden have somebody come out and go,  he paid me to be there.  Right.  That's the only reason I have a problem with a plant.  Lillian could be Kruskin's daughter.  That's true.  Did she look like, did she wear big glasses?  Yeah, she shook the hell out of my hand.  If you're going to find plants, you're going to find people who aren't going to talk that you can trust, possibly family members or whatever.  Because Steve and I, we asked four people total before Lillian said yes, and Lillian was one of the four people that turned us down at first. 
[02:30:00]  And then we went and asked a couple, the guy who was sitting just outside of the courtyard.  How the hell did he go with that?  We never got back to Jillian.  You walked out, four or five people are out there, maybe all four or five are in.  No, they weren't just waiting out there.  We had to, like, go all over the courtyard.  We were expecting there to be a group of people waiting.  Why not go on?  We should have went on the street.  See, we didn't.  Hindsight.  I think you guys are missing the thing.  I don't think it mattered what card somebody said.  I firmly believe that he would have pulled it off because that was a dummy deck with X amount of cards missing from it. 
[02:30:30]  I think that, I mean, these statistics don't mean anything.  But let's say...  Dude, the person on the street could pick any card.  So who cares about a dummy deck?  Let's say that there is a small point to the, what do they call the sleight of mouth?  Let's say that that works eight out of ten times.  Yeah.  And that's a dummy deck missing.  Because you didn't count, King of Spades.  You didn't count all those cards.  No, I just went one, two, three.  So let's say the odds are, because he's tested this, because he's a brilliant guy.  Yeah.  When you say certain things, eight out of ten times, you're going to get the card you're looking for. 
[02:31:00]  I don't know.  The one of the cards.  And he's got a dummy deck there.  It's hard to explain, but I really think that no matter what card you said, it will come up right.  Joe, Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  It has to be something involving the plant, because at first, when you almost took that guy on the phones, he freaked out.  Jay.  Oh, yeah.  And then he's like, oh, aren't you going to send Ron down?  Right.  That's true.  He didn't want Jay at all.  Yeah.  Why couldn't Jay do the trick?  He was ready.  Interesting.  Interesting.  Why did we need to go get the caller out on the street? 
[02:31:30]  We could have just had a random caller call the show.  But then how do we know that Jay is in his plant that's calling in?  Because of fact, it's tested.  Then we would have been saying that.  No.  Come on.  If Jay was going to show you, all right, somehow he got through, and his plants flooded the phone lines.  And got through.  Well, you know we would have been saying that.  The odds, though.  You can't.  No.  Anyway, this guy pulls it off is going to be us freaking out.  How did he know that Rick wasn't just going to see somebody he recognized from the building 
[02:32:00]  and go right to them?  That's the only problem I have with a plant.  There's too much decision-making left to Rick.  Right.  Because I know how.  The whole show is in on it.  No.  And then when he said, want to get a building?  He goes, get a building security guard.  No, I might know him.  That's a little weird.  Well, he just throws that stuff out.  Yeah, I know.  It's going to blow you off.  Well, it works.  Cressions do that crap all the time.  And I mean, Steve and I were walking around, and I was even thinking, maybe I'll just grab  somebody we know coming out of the building.  Yeah, because a couple people that work upstairs walked by. 
[02:32:30]  We didn't grab them.  So.  But let's say you had.  The whole plant thing wouldn't work.  That's why I say out the window.  It doesn't matter what card you pick.  It's set up.  He will get it either way.  Okay.  Here.  I'm taking a card out, right?  Here we go.  I took it out of the deck.  Okay?  Yeah.  Okay?  All right, Opie, pick a card, and don't be brokenhearted if it's the wrong one.  Four of clubs?  Oh, geez. 
[02:33:00]  Ten of clubs.  I gave you the little subliminal thing.  To not pick a heart, I don't understand what you're talking about.  No, but you're.  There's no statistical thing involved in this.  There can't be.  There can be, because what I'm saying is, let's say that by doing that.  Give me the audio of Christian talking about it.  He said, I, your mind's eye.  Give me the audio.  Get to the point where Rick is on the phone.  We will figure this one out.  Yes, yes.  Tear this apart.  Tony, what's up?  The only thing I caught is that he was very persistent that you get Lily in the phone. 
[02:33:30]  Just a bit.  And, dude, it's like, you remember how you used to cheat at Polka?  Yeah.  With your friends?  Hey, Joe DiMaggio was like the best player.  Or like Joe Torre, number nine.  There you go.  I don't know, man.  Whether he did it or not, I just observed that he was very persistent that you give the phone to Lillian.  He needed Lillian.  Later, guys.  All right.  No, and the only thing I'm saying is, I understand how you're saying statistical.  No one's named Lillian, by the way. 
[02:34:00]  But regardless of if some cards were missing in that original deck, if it wasn't this one.  Right.  There were some legitimate cards in that deck.  A lot of them.  So, what if she would have picked one of those cards?  Then all of a sudden I go, one, two, three.  All right.  Four, Kreskin.  Four is the number of cards I had to count before I got to her.  Now what, funny man?  Then he has a certain way.  Then he has a different trick.  He goes into a different direction.  He goes, okay, four, and then if we take four, you mean it turns into something else? 
[02:34:30]  Something else, and he'll pull it out of his pocket.  You know, he might have three decks on him, and he knows where every card in every deck is.  He's a brilliant guy.  It's not out of the realm of possibility, but that was the way it worked out.  Because say there was the Jack of Spades missing, King of Spades, and three other cards,  because statistically, one of them is going to come up.  That's what I'm saying.  All the people on the phone saying audible hints and all that, no way.  I don't think you, no way is that part of it.  It's all Kreskin.  It's all him.  Because he needs this to work every single time.  Too much of a chance.  What if it's a pothead not really listening?  Right.  And you're thinking the first one was the guy that was in the studio with him, 
[02:35:00]  wrote that down and put it in the envelope?  Oh, without a doubt.  And gave it to him.  He was here taking pictures with an Instamatic camera.  He's Kreskin's assistant, and he's taking pictures of Kreskin with an Instamatic camera  that he just fought off the corner.  He was standing there for a second.  And he was definitely standing where the envelopes ended up being.  I'm telling you.  That one I know.  Okay.  I'll give him that one.  Do we have Steve's videotape? 
[02:35:30]  Yes.  Perhaps that would lead us in the right direction.  No.  Okay.  And finish up this mess.  We call.  The Opie and Anthony Shoe.  All this week with Opie and Anthony, it's Mommy, what would you do for Britney Spears tickets?  So, if you're a mommy, call now.  The Opie and Anthony Shoe.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Shoe.  Oh, wow. 
[02:36:00]  By the way, you could get rid of the glass of water by now.  All right.  Well, see, look at these idiots.  Huh.  Phil.  He had 52 different tricks for whatever card was picked.  For instance, she says Ace of Hearts, and he goes to the trick where the Ace of Hearts is in his shoe.  No.  The card was missing.  From the deck.  From the deck.  And no one touched.  Now, perhaps there were a few cards missing from that deck that I had that I was counting off, 
[02:36:30]  and I'm not perceptive enough to realize that, hey, you know, I haven't passed the king.  Or I haven't passed the king of spades or hearts or whatever it is.  But it still leaves too much up to chance.  Exactly.  But what if they do pick one of the other cards, like two of clubs,  and he just doesn't say go to the briefcase in there.  He has a certain way he can go with a deck that's in his pocket.  He needs to go to the briefcase.  See, Crescent, why did you put the briefcase on the garbage pail kind of thing? 
[02:37:00]  You know, he knew.  That means he would have to have 52 tricks set up.  He knew that girl was going to say Jack of Spades.  Yes.  He knew it.  That was how the trick was set up.  There could be no other answer.  And the reason?  So she had to be in plan.  So her whole object was to get to Rick.  Jack, the trick there is not what Crescent did.  The trick is not me counting off and him having it in his pocket.  The trick there, the talent, is getting the plan to get to Rick.  Lillian.  Every time. 
[02:37:30]  Someone else gets to the phone first,  and then he's got some tricks up his sleeve where he can do a little something else.  Maybe.  All right.  How about, all right, Bob, well, this is what I want you to do.  Are there any other people around?  Exactly.  Something like that.  Bob?  We didn't know that Lillian was officially going to pick the card.  We didn't know how the trick was going to play out.  Right.  Whoever got to the phone first, okay, now you're going to help me get to Lillian.  And this person doesn't even know he's going to, you know, help get Lillian on the phone. 
[02:38:00]  All right, Bob, well, we're going to start the trick now.  Are there other people on the sidewalk?  Yes.  Okay.  What do you got?  Well, there's two girls here, a blonde and a brunette.  All right.  What the hell?  Why don't you give the phone to the blonde?  Boom.  Now Lillian's got the phone.  Or go up to a random person there and ask him for a card.  All right, we got to get the hell out of here.  Kreskin wasted up all our time once again.  Bastard.  All right, Anthony, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today? 
[02:38:30]  F. Todd from Westchester, PA.  Guys, be careful playing with magic.  That's how you get aged.  That's funny.  Jersey Gary.  I learned today on the show, an Anthony Thanksgiving family dinner is like an episode of The Sopranos.  A 27-minute Hummer, ponderous, effing ponderous.  Anthony is still traumatized by not getting the G.I.  Joe helicopter for Christmas.  I can get a Hummer from a hooker, then run her over with my car to get my money back.  He also learned the screaming white girl isn't included with the black G.I. 
[02:39:00]  Joe.  He learned the new name of the show is the Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anthony show.  And finally, the only thing more painful than listening to a Kreskin bit is going to see Rich Foss.  Oh, wow.  Mike from Hoboken.  Yeah, Kreskin picked the card and STP was in studio playing Salad Girl.  Wow, there you go.  There's one for New York.  Big Josh.  He learned Opie and Anthony sponsors should save their money since O&A listeners are so stupid  and they can't understand the concept of buying products.  And CBS and Infinity are either buying it's satellite radio or they are very, very effing stupid. 
[02:39:30]  Jameek from Brooklyn.  I learned Ken Stevens plus Amazing Kreskin equals radio poison.  MTV is just a fad.  And Yumdar from Texas at 2.47 a.m. will be checking out the Blues Network.  That's very good.  I learned Anthony's family have giant feet and dumb voices.  Some of the people, yeah.  Yeah.  Caroline. 
[02:40:00]  Hey, how are you?  Hey, Caroline.  I learned that Opie thinks that Kreskin has actually had sex.  What do you mean?  Well, you said that maybe Lily was his daughter.  Oh.  I'm sure he was a fine-looking man in his day.  Oh, come on.  I think that's the whole source of his power.  Yeah.  That's the source of his power.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Like he's got powers.  He has no powers.  No.  It's a trick.  That much we know.  Then the whole thing is figure it out.  How he did the trick. 
[02:40:30]  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right.  Today, I learned a few things.  Sega, worse than AIDS.  Right.  Norton thinks cloning is more important than video games.  Right.  Charles Nelson Reilly canceled because he got the aw, aw, aw.  And with satellite radio, I can now drive right through New York without ever tuning in Opie and Anthony.  There you go.  Thanks, guys.  All right, Chris.  And for the people that think Kreskin has these powers, he has such powers.  Why are we pushing his book on the air? 
[02:41:00]  The only reason to push a book on the air is to make money.  Now, if you have the powers, wouldn't you do something else that would get you faster money, like betting the horses or picking the numbers?  Chris, Kreskin does not have powers.  He's not Kreskin Potter.  Amazing Kreskin's future with the stars.  Kreskin.com and Amazon.com, Anthony.  Huh.  Somebody using the, listen back to the tape.  Are you facing traffic? 
[02:41:30]  Face card.  Uh, I don't know what that means, though.  No, it's too much to chance.  Spade, mind, eye, face.  They may all be, I'm telling you, it's got something to do with percentages and he has an alternate plan.  No, it's still the plan.  He can't deal with percentages.  He has to be right every time.  He can't screw up on the Opie and Anthony show.  But he has an alternate plan if he doesn't get what he thinks.  Well, that I kind of understand, too.  But I think the ultimate plan comes into play with the plant, Lillian.  If Lillian doesn't get to the ball.  Look at us.  We are so friggin' ridiculous with this.  I need to figure this one out. 
[02:42:00]  I know.  I did a good job with the last time he came in.  And I'm telling you, I'm on to something here.  Dave, what's up?  Today I learned that in the future we're going to have a taint-off.  Yes, we are.  All right, thank you.  You guys rule.  All right.  I'm seeing a taint.  All right, we've got to get the hell out of here, Anthony.  It can't be that easy.  Well, we had a lot of fun.  Hey, we got some tickets to see the Heavy Metal Comedy Tour with Jim Brewer at Evering Plaza on Wednesday.  A few tickets still available.  We're all going.  You can get the tickets through Ticketmaster. 
[02:42:30]  Or if you're in the New York area, stay on the lines and we'll give out a couple pairs of tickets, okay?  Mm-hmm.  And Brewer coming in later this week to play Stoner Spilling Bee and hang with the boys.  Right.  And tomorrow, Mommies, what will you do for Britney Spears tickets?  We'll finally get to your phone calls and get enough Mommies down here for Friday's show, okay?  Oh, Dan, there's one more thing.  I learned N.E.W. salespeople and Jewish truck drivers have a lot in common.  Bingo.  Bingo.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hold it close, baby!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah, sure. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, sure. </pre>
