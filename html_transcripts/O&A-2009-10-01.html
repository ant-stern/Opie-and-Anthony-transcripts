<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcast without Opie due to illness, featured Anthony Cumia and Jim Norton. The show began with crude jokes about oral sex and male-on-male kissing, before launching into a preview of "Jocktober," a segment satirizing other radio shows, specifically targeting the "Rocky and Sue" morning show from Wilkes-Barre, PA,  for its incessant interruptions and sexually suggestive banter.  Anthony expressed his frustration with SiriusXM management's interference, citing their rejection of a promo featuring the phrase "four hours of horse shit,"  the alteration of "replay" to "encore," and the suggested renaming of "Line of the Day" to "Worst Line of the Day." The rejected promo, complete with horse noises, was played.  The discussion then veered towards a picture of Kevin Smith (a scheduled guest), generating more sexually charged humor.  Anthony celebrated the final payment of his divorce settlement, finalized on October 1st,  detailing his experiences in court, including allegations of a threesome reported in the New York Post and Daily News. He voiced anger towards the financial burden and perceived unfairness of the divorce system, particularly the alimony payments in cases without children, contrasting this with the societal push for gender equality in the workplace.  Callers shared their own divorce experiences, often mirroring Anthony's sentiments.

The show featured a lengthy discussion on Roman Polanski's conviction for statutory rape, with Jim Florentine, a guest in studio, joining the conversation, which was filled with offensive language. The hosts debated the differing reactions to Polanskiâ€™s actions based on his celebrity status, playing a clip from a CNN segment featuring celebrity opinions.  This segment also included a lengthy digression about Florentine's experiences procuring women for his boss.  A call from Sean relayed Ron Bennington's sarcastic commentary on the situation.  The discussion covered *Bad Lieutenant* and a scene involving a nun.  Later, Kevin Smith joined the show, shifting the conversation towards filmmaking techniques, his experiences with the studio system, and an anecdote about an incident involving him, Florentine, and a bathroom. The conversation then shifted to the Mercury space program and high-altitude parachute jumping.

The show included a discussion about atmospheric re-entry and friction, mocking a past interview with physicist Michio Kaku.  A call to "Dr. Steve," a physics expert, provided explanations on atmospheric pressure and orbital mechanics.  The conversation took a misogynistic turn with highly insulting remarks directed at a caller, "Lady Trucker."  After Dr. Steve's departure,  the conversation covered a listener's experience with potent marijuana-infused brownies, culminating in a played 911 call. The hosts then discussed marijuana potency and its impact on Kevin Smith's creativity,  with Smith detailing his increased marijuana use and its effects on his writing, including a Batman miniseries.  The discussion continued to pornography, specifically amateur and revenge porn websites, and the infamous "Faces of Death" videos.

A significant portion of the show focused on amateur pornography found online and surveillance videos from convenience stores.  The hosts detailed the appeal of amateur porn, citing the perceived authenticity and background details.  One anecdote involved a graphic description of a picture.  The discussion shifted to convenience store robbery videos and a particularly inept robber attempting to enter a liquor store through the roof.  They also touched upon online videos of black-on-white crimes presented as protests.  Further conversation revolved around a documentary about the Westboro Baptist Church, featuring Fred Phelps and his daughter Shirley, and specific British documentary makers who interviewed the Phelps family.  Finally, they discussed a recent terrorist plot involving nail polish remover and the release of prisoners from Guantanamo Bay.  Throughout, the hosts used vulgar and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  What are you motherfuckers who sing the Barry Manilow concert?  Are you ready?  Let me hear you make some noise!  Enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  I feel so sorry for Jimmy every time that little clip plays of him intro-ing Ozzy.  So does Jimmy.  So does Jimmy.  Jimmy literally throws his headphones off and plugs his ears like a retard rocking in his feces at a mental institution. 
[00:00:30]  The way you people feel like when I talk, that's how I feel like when I hear that.  Yes.  You.  It bothers me.  Hey, welcome.  Opie and Anthony show.  Opie's not in today.  Sans Opie.  Opie sickly.  He has, um, well, he has the AIDS.  Yep.  Or a sore throat.  One or the other.  I forgot.  He told me I can't quite remember.  I was busy.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was something.  No, he does.  He's got a, uh, he's got a tender throat. 
[00:01:00]  And, uh, in this business, throat very important.  Yes.  Yes.  We tried fixing it too last, uh, because we, Opie and I live next to each other.  Yeah.  And he said my throat is very sore.  And I said, why don't you nurse on this for a minute?  He nursed on it for maybe an hour and a half.  Didn't help the throat.  A lot of deep man-to-man kissing.  Nothing seemed to help.  Was there a lot of, oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Grunting and groaning.  We were holding the back of each other's heads so firmly that I felt like a warm handprint  on the back of my head.  It was really fun to try to cure the sore throat, but we couldn't quite get it done. 
[00:01:30]  Now I'm feeling a bit sick.  I love, I love how Jimmy's man-on-man kissing involves like a lot of grunting.  When, when you kiss a woman, like you're not going, oh, oh, oh, oh, but you're man-on-man  kissing.  There's a lot of grunting and groaning.  I always pictured it as two men with really, really thinly shaved beards and they just can't  be masculine enough.  It's got to be very manly sounds coming out of it.  Yeah, it's the worst sound.  It's like when a girl's giving you a head and she has like her nose by your belly. 
[00:02:00]  They, they breathe, their cheeks puff out and they breathe, breathe around your hog.  It sounds lovely though.  Yeah.  They always get the low end.  Yeah.  So it's Anthony and Jimmy Norton, of course, joining us in a few minutes will be director,  actor, writer, author, Kevin Smith. 
[00:02:30]  That's right.  Kevin Smith going to be hanging out.  And we also have a Florentine common Jim Jim coming in at 830.  I told him to come in earlier.  Yeah.  Kevin Smith has thick books.  Like he, he puts out really quality shit.  You know, he can write the guy.  Obviously he does movies, but yeah, as far as his books go and when he does those college  tours where he just can stand up and talk for hours on end and keep it entertaining and compelling  and shit. 
[00:03:00]  Like, how do you do that?  How do you do that?  I hope I'm still in the movie.  Oh yeah.  Yes.  I bet you are.  I hope so.  I bet he's afraid to cut you out.  No, he's probably.  I'm going to dare him to cut you out of the movie.  No, don't do that.  He's not afraid.  I dare you to cut Jimmy out.  Kevin's not, he's not easily frightened.  No.  He doesn't take a lot of dares.  I want to dare him.  I prefer you didn't.  I bet you $1,000 you won't cut Jimmy out of the movie.  And I'll dare him by $5,000 to make the scene longer.  Just slow it. 
[00:03:30]  I want him to slow the audio down.  Oh, is that at the slow-mo scene?  Are you barely, what's that picture of him?  I don't know.  It's Kevin in a mirror, no, in a doorway holding his arm up behind his head.  What is he doing?  I don't know.  When was that taken?  Is that just a random picture you found?  He looks like at least three of the Boston Red Sox.  That's what they all look like with that creepy short beard and homoerotic poses.  Hold on, sweetie's mic is on.  Please, please.  It just says Kevin Smith topless as the caption. 
[00:04:00]  Kevin Smith topless.  Which he is.  And that he is.  Yep.  Rarrel.  I hope it was a photo from Iraq.  He'd been kidnapped.  Been kidnapped in Afghanistan.  Look at him topless that way.  We all got it, Jim.  Yes, of course.  Don't know how to explain it.  Uh, it is October 1st today.  Yep.  Now, a couple of things, um, happen in October.  One of which, very excited about, Jocktober starts.  Now, this is a tradition carried on by the Opie and Anthony show for, uh, decades now. 
[00:04:30]  I think we started our first one 35, 40 years ago.  I thought one.  Uh, one?  Oh, we've done one?  Yeah.  Okay.  So, one.  So, this is our second annual Jocktober.  Very exciting.  This is where, um, we get, uh, somebody like the likes of Sam to just scour the FM airwaves  to find radio shows worthy of paying tribute to on Jocktober. 
[00:05:00]  You might say, Anthony, what is the criteria for a show that you would pay tribute to on Jocktober, uh, during Jocktober?  And we are looking for shows that are just adorable, um, shows that have that man-woman kind of rapport thing going on.  Like, are they married?  Are they not?  They sure act like a married couple.  A little bickering and bantering.  But, you know, they'll kiss and make up in the end. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, and the woman that's there to just keep him in line, because gosh knows how that guy could just run wild if she wasn't there.  Thank God she keeps him in check.  Like the Julie and Chip morning show, if that exists.  Yeah, something like that.  Oh, it would be, too.  Would it be Julie and Chip or Chip and Julie, though?  Yeah, Chip, Chip, line, N, line, Julie.  N, Julie.  And then the thing would be some way to wrap her J around.  That is not, you punched in Chip and Julie and got that? 
[00:06:00]  That's Chip and Julie.  Wow.  Julie's the dog.  Oh, my God.  In both cases.  Should be baldy and mullet.  It's some guy with a mullet, some woman with very thin hair, and a golden retriever with peanut butter on his nose.  The golden retriever is so bored with these two people.  Yeah, he's had it.  Yeah, he's really tired of them.  He's hoping they're the victim of a wilding in that park they're in.  They're in a nice park, and he's just hoping that some youth has attacked them.  Oh, please.  He should rip their throats out and just trot away. 
[00:06:30]  A little bone in his mouth.  You shoot down, you see his little doggy oven mitts.  And a little mat.  His red lipstick dick.  Let me see.  What time is it?  We've been talking for eight minutes, and it's already a dog fuck joke.  What happens?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  Yes, Julie and Chip.  Oh, Chip and Julie.  That would be a perfect example.  But those are the shows we're looking for.  And I guess Sam got a few.  Did Sam, you got a few? 
[00:07:00]  Well, there's been some mystery about Jocktober because we have a new regime, of course, here  at Sirius.  And Jocktober has come up in the meetings because they go, what are you guys working on?  Oh, it has.  And I'll say, Jocktober.  Cool.  And they'll go, what is that?  And I explain we just make fun of a different radio show every single day for October.  And what problem could they possibly have with that?  Well, they go, you're not going to do that every day.  And I know we probably will.  We probably will.  We will do that every day. 
[00:07:30]  We so choose.  You're not going to do that every day, are you?  Probably every day.  Maybe more than once on a given day.  Yeah, sure.  Perhaps three times.  Jeez.  Depending on how we feel.  So what are you going to do?  Make horrid creative decisions for our show?  Are you going to do that every day?  Oh.  What?  Well, they do tend to.  We did have a little chit-chat about something.  If you've been keeping tabs on the Opie and Anthony show, which I certainly hope you are. 
[00:08:00]  Of course you have.  You will know that management occasionally does slide their slimy little hands in on our program.  And make creative decisions that we hate all the time.  But it should only be creative suggestions, not decisions.  Suggestions, not decisions.  Right.  You got any better suggestions?  From Jaws.  Ah.  Well, we, they decided that the word replay, when we do a replay, which is our 3 to, what 
[00:08:30]  is it, 7 around there?  Yes.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Our 3 to 7 p.m. Eastern time replay is a replay of what we do from 6 to 11 live.  Re-played.  They said that there's some negative connotations to the word replay.  I don't understand what those negative things are.  I've never walked around and said, another fucking replay moved into my neighborhood. 
[00:09:00]  Holy shit.  Those replays cannot drive.  Ah, great.  I got to take Valtteri.  I got replays showing up on my dick.  Yeah, it's not, it's not that bad a word.  It's not a negative word.  No, it's what it is.  Yes.  They decided that encore is a better way to put it.  An encore presentation of the Opie and Anthony show, which will start at 3 o'clock.  It's, it's semantics.  It's the old, a rose by any other name is still four shitty mediocre hours of radio. 
[00:09:30]  Absolutely.  Would a rose by any other name sound just as lousy.  Exactly.  But, uh, they decided, you know, that, uh, an encore presentation is, is, it sounds better.  So we were joking, uh, that perhaps something like four hours of horse shit, um, rehashed crap.  Yep.  Things like that would be funny to put on, uh, a promo. 
[00:10:00]  Well, I guess they made a, uh, a promo that said four hours of horse shit, four hours of  horse shit.  And they turned it down.  They denied our promo.  I don't like the fact that they have to approve the promos creatively.  What is that?  What is that?  I don't think that their place really is to be in the creative process.  Process they could, well, they could be in the creative process as, you know, suggestions. 
[00:10:30]  We're always open to suggestions.  We'll say no every time.  But we're very open to hearing them.  And, uh, they said no to our four hours of horse shit promo that was made.  Uh, I haven't heard this yet.  I hope we have it.  Because I do want to play it.  Um, was it made or was it just suggested?  Yeah, it's burning now.  Oh, okay.  Uh, yeah, I definitely want to hear that and see if it's funny.  Now, now the reason they, they shot it down was, I guess they said that people that haven't 
[00:11:00]  been really paying attention or the casual listener wouldn't get it.  They'd listen and instead of knowing the situation and saying, well, the replay and the encore  and all that, they're just going into a cold and they hear four hours of horse shit.  They're going to be like, I don't understand the joke.  But meanwhile, to me, it's a joke that kind of, it stands on its own.  It's funny.  It's obviously sarcastic.  Obviously.  And you can't tell us how to appeal to people that we want to appeal to because we kind 
[00:11:30]  of, we've been doing this for a while so we know and we were just on XM, we kind of had  complete control over content on the channel and it was fairly successful with listeners.  Yeah.  It was fairly successful.  And XM started off with a shitty decision on calling the channel virus or whatever they  called it at first.  They would never call the Opie and Anthony channel, which is so stupid.  It should be called the, how about this?  If you can get this channel renamed the Opie and Anthony channel, which is not a disrespect  to Rod and Fez.  Opie and Anthony is a very recognizable name. 
[00:12:00]  Then I will respect creative input.  Yeah.  But you know, until then it's like, come on, you're just throwing out ideas.  Those, those suggestions go to the wayside.  So, but, uh, you know, I don't want to make this a complete bitch fest, but I'm just saying  these things happen.  I like, I like letting the, uh, uh, listeners in on what, what goes on, especially behind  the scenes, our little battles with management.  And another thing is like, I'd like to hear these things before they're completely shot  down.  Like, like, like I, I believe me, I have the utmost respect for Danny, for Sam, for Travis, 
[00:12:30]  for, okay, I have the utmost respect for them and, and, and their, uh, creative decision  making and everything like that.  We, we depend on them on a daily basis, but management going to them and shooting down 
[00:13:00]  a creative decision without, you know, consulting us, uh, by email, of course, because face  to face, I, I don't, I, I don't have the time.  Stop it.  I'm a busy, busy man.  So, uh, an email that says, Hey, you know, we don't like that one that, and, and then  we would yell at them and say, Hey, get out of our creative assholes and leave us alone.  Um, but something that we're involved with here might be nice.  Did, but yeah, cause we came up with an idea. 
[00:13:30]  It was a silly idea, but people who wouldn't get that, like who's going to hear four hours  of horseshit and go, Oh, I'm not listening to that.  It must be horseshit.  No, it's, if I heard that promo knowing me, and I think I kind of fall into the type of  person that would listen to this program if I wasn't on it, uh, I would hear that and  go, you know, fuck, I got to listen to that four hours of horseshit, love four hours of  horseshit.  And that's sarcastic type of thing. 
[00:14:00]  First of all, the corny, uh, rock and roll, we don't need that all the time.  No, we can do something stupid and silly.  And anybody that doesn't know what they're in for within five minutes knows what they're  listening to and will like it or not like it.  You don't have to spoon feed people.  This is what the show is.  Silly.  It's stupid.  Whatever you want to call it, listen to it and like it or don't.  Yeah.  That's pretty much, uh, it, it, and again, they did the same semantics thing with worst  of the week. 
[00:14:30]  Kind of what?  Uh, worst of the week.  That hasn't been changed, I hope.  No.  What did they, uh, want to do?  No, I'm just, it would be the people who listened to worst of would probably also understand  the four hours of horseshit.  Oh, they would write, write.  I gotcha.  Okay.  I thought it was another semantics thing that they like pulling.  Although there have been a couple of more.  Line of the day.  Line of the day?  Yeah.  They wanted to call it.  They felt that it didn't fit the attitude of the show and maybe we should do like worst  line of the day.  No.  Get it?  Really?  Should we change the opening to line of the day? 
[00:15:00]  No.  That's a masterpiece.  Worst line of the day.  Actually, that was, that was suggested.  Of course.  Yes.  Of course.  But it's good to see they understand the fans and the show.  Have they ever interacted with our fans?  And this is whoever it is.  No.  Have they ever read the emails we get from our fans?  Yeah.  Do you understand they call us up and they go, Frankis!  And they hang up?  I don't know.  Right now, I guess we're just addressing a nameless, faceless executive.  Like, I don't know who this is. 
[00:15:30]  I honestly don't either and I don't care.  That's making this.  It doesn't matter to me.  Yeah.  And please don't schedule a meeting with me about this.  I can do everything by email.  Text.  I got picture text now.  So I'll text you a semi-interested look like I'm going, hmm, hmm, hmm.  Um, because I really, I think it can be settled through email.  But at least, you know, some communication there between the two of us.  Yeah.  Because as far as, like, getting the show, like, hey, we want people to go out there and 
[00:16:00]  listen to the show.  Well, then just promote us.  Yeah.  That's all.  Promote us.  That's all.  Don't worry about what something's called.  If something on this program has worked for well over five years, in some cases over  ten years, nah, you could leave it alone.  I think we know when it's maybe burnt out and time to throw to the wayside, but for  the most part, bah, leave it alone.  And the death of radio shows is when they start listening to any management on creative  issues as far as, I think this would be funny. 
[00:16:30]  Do ya?  Yeah.  We don't care if you think that would be funny.  We know what works for the show.  Channel structuring and stuff like that, fair enough.  They have some good points and suggestions.  All right, fine.  But when it comes to the humor or the things that we want to convey, this is what the show  represents comedically, I don't think anybody should be putting their hands in that.  No, occasionally they'll have a good suggestion.  Yeah.  I've yet to find that occasion.  But, but, you never know.  It's like Lotto.  But they shouldn't really be diving and putting their hands in the dough. 
[00:17:00]  And dictating.  Yes.  Dick.  Dick.  Sorry.  There's a dash in there.  Makes me laugh every time.  Let's see.  What is this?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Anthony's reading something.  It's been highlighted.  Or high lit, it should be.  See, it's from somebody, a management type.  Um, and it's creative, uh, suggestions on how, how, uh, uh, uh, an opening should be 
[00:17:30]  made, a, uh, the encore thing.  It's got suggestions for sound effects and, and like everything.  Does it?  Yeah.  Like, like it's a script.  Stop it!  That, can I see it?  I won't.  Yeah, take a look.  It's just, I don't, I don't, I don't know.  I don't know what to do with this.  What do you do?  Jimmy's not it funny.  All right. 
[00:18:00]  All right.  Roll it then.  Come on.  Can I hear the, um.  That's what we made.  Right there.  That's what you made.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  The, that little intro.  Yeah.  Outro with, you know, a space in between is what we made.  But calling it.  Four hours of horse shit.  All right.  Let's listen to the promo that was denied.  This is the four hours of horse shit promo.  You're listening to four hours of complete horse shit.  Again.  Here's something that might pique your interest. 
[00:18:30]  I like that.  Complete horse shit, which I like even better.  And the horse noise.  Yes.  You know it's a horse, then you knew it was shit.  No.  Oh.  The virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  More horse shit coming up next.  And that's what would have been on the air.  Who wouldn't fucking get that?  Yeah.  Don't you get the sarcasm and.  Who would.  What. 
[00:19:00]  What would I want to listen to as a guy who I'm trying to appeal to that?  Or, uh.  Bam.  Rock and roll.  I'd rather listen to the fucking funny one.  Well, I'll tell you something.  That's probably getting isolated in news.  Thank you.  Hope so.  Maybe Ozzy needs to walk into a room.  I can shout it.  God, am I a homo?  I'm worthless.  So, uh.  Yeah.  Well, how do we get started on that?  Rocktober.  Jack.  Jacktober.  Well, it is Rocktober in the radio world.  Yeah.  So, uh, I'm sure wherever you're listening, there's some FM hack station doing Rocktober. 
[00:19:30]  Which, uh, consists of what?  What were you doing before that?  You weren't rocking in, uh, September?  Not as hard.  No, not as hard.  Now they're rocking.  Yeah.  Rocktober.  But we do Jocktober.  So, um.  I definitely want to hear some of these.  Well, you want to.  Dude, I'm seriously.  I really want that promo to run.  I think that's funny.  I think it is, too.  I, you know, I, I, I wonder what the. 
[00:20:00]  I don't mind suggestions.  A meeting would be like.  People suggesting things.  Ah, we'd get the.  I don't, uh.  Ah.  You know, there's.  Here's my.  Here's my take on, on why this wouldn't.  What?  What?  Who the?  Who the?  What the?  You know, it's just.  So, I guess.  I guess at some point we're going to have to.  Oh, Jesus.  We'll have to.  We'll have to address that.  I'm looking at Rocky and Sue. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  Let's go to Rocky and Sue.  Rocky and Sue's, uh.  Wow.  Web page.  Jesus.  Wow.  That is KRZ.  Rocky Dennis.  Are they crazy?  Is that KRZ?  Because I would think the KRZ is crazy.  Hey, crazy.  I'll tell you this.  For today's Jocktober, we're going all the way to Wilkes-Barre.  PA.  Wow.  Yeah.  To KRZ, the Rocky and Sue morning show.  Is that a triple digit market?  Does that want to be triple where you need three numbers to tell what market it is? 
[00:21:00]  Like Syracuse?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not sure.  Oh, I'm certain it's somewhere up there.  But I believe this morning duo has been on the air for like 20 years or something.  Wow.  They're a staple in Wilkes-Barre.  And they may or may not be married.  May or may not.  So they're pulling it off.  They're doing the job.  That's what they're supposed to do.  People go, are they?  I don't know.  They certainly sound like us, hon.  As the emasculated husband drives his minivan with the wife to the grocery store. 
[00:21:30]  They certainly sound like we do.  These are people I'd like to maybe have a dinner party with.  What up?  As the semi plows into him and T-bones him.  How great is that?  If the last thing they say is, I wonder what Rocky and Sue are going to say about that before they're fucking sawed in half by a fucking trucker on Crank.  Don't say Crank.  That's not as funny.  Say Coke.  Yeah.  I think crystal methamphetamine so everyone gets it. 
[00:22:00]  Not everyone knows drug jargon.  It is true.  It's true.  I know.  You can tell it's a successful morning show.  Because in the mornings, Sue is a co-host.  In the afternoons, she is the queen of real estate.  What?  So yes, she sells real estate in the afternoon.  Oh, cool.  Oh, she's a real estate?  Yes.  I've already done enough on real estate brokers and agents.  Ugh.  They're all out of the same mold. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  And I'm sorry if you are one, but it's usually some woman who...  Now, this isn't every single one of them.  Because I have met a couple of nice ones.  But this is usually the mold of a real estate agent woman.  A little too old to try to be looking as hot as she thinks she is.  That bleach blonde hair.  A lot of makeup.  Yeah, thanks. 
[00:23:00]  Very yappy.  And usually drives a big car very fast.  Because you've got to follow them from, you know, house to house.  When you're trying to find houses.  And then they get out and they just...  I don't know what their job is, first of all.  Hey, here's a kitchen.  Hey, here's a bedroom.  Hey, here's a living room.  I know.  Look, it comes with a fireplace.  Oh, thank God you told me I was going to keep my cat in there.  Oh, whew.  Thank God for you.  How much?  Same mold. 
[00:23:30]  And she looks exactly like that.  Although her hair is a little too short.  She's got kind of a dikey haircut.  And he just looks like that Mr. Science guy.  Bill Nye the Science guy.  He's a little older.  His neck kind of gives it away.  Yeah, he should wear turtlenecks.  And she should...  Well, I won't even say what she should do.  Rocky and Sue.  Why don't you give them a shot before you start, you know...  Fair enough.  They're busting their chops.  You know something, Sam? 
[00:24:00]  You are so right.  You could just see, like...  Because you think a morning show has been around for 20 years.  They're probably on the cusp.  Very exciting.  It's not like they would just get on the air and talk about nothing at all.  Yeah, yeah.  20 years of experience with each other in the same market.  They probably know all the ins and outs of Wilkes-Barre.  Everything Wilkes-Barre, they know.  That's right.  Everything.  Nothing in Wilkes-Barre gets by them.  No, it's Rocky and Sue.  They've been there forever.  When you're in market number 70, you really need to know all the local angles. 
[00:24:30]  70.  First of all, now I want to apologize to Rocky and Sue.  I said triple digits, and it's 70.  Yes.  Mark and 70.  When you want Wilkes-Barre, you know who you go to?  Those two.  Rocky and Sue, my friends.  Absolutely.  Well, let's give a little start out.  I guess...  Now, Sam has prefaced some of these clips in his inimitable style.  Rocky starts a poll...  The poll question?  Yeah, they got like a poll question where people can call up.  They'll ask a question... 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  ...and ask the audience to call in with the answers.  Kind of like a...  I couldn't think of anything.  Like a poll.  Audience participation, I think.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, polls, all the rage because of the internets.  So...  And I'm sure Rocky and Sue want to be like on the cutting edge of the intratubes.  They have a blog, so...  What?  Yeah.  Wow.  So, them doing a poll kind of question.  Eh, kind of getting into that whole attitude.  I like that.  And then it says, the poll question, but Sue thinks he goes a little far. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, good gravy.  I can't wait to hear this one.  Yeah, you go to a point and then it's like...  Yeah.  It's like, come on, Rocky.  Yeah.  Come on.  But wouldn't it be funny if he really did...  Like if they were doing a fun poll and then he just took a shit into like a plastic child  shovel and then started flinging at her on the air.  Yelling racial epithets.  Yeah, and they're both white.  She's like, what's wrong with you?  Fantastic.  All right.  Let's hear Rocky starting the poll question. 
[00:26:00]  The Rocky and Sue Show.  On 98.5 K-R-Z.  All right.  The question.  One-third of the women polled said they do this right after a breakup.  One-third said they do this right after breaking up.  Uh-huh.  What is it?  1-800-222-0985...  Hold on, hold on.  Wow, that's a good question.  Yeah, see?  How many women?  Two out of three?  Yeah.  No. 
[00:26:30]  I thought one-third.  I don't know, maybe.  One-third.  So they do this after a breakup?  Yeah.  My guess is tickle their clit with a rake.  That probably comes a little further down the list.  This seems to be something pretty popular.  But gosh, if I don't know where Rocky's going with this one.  Oh, boy.  I thank God Sue's there to calm him down, because I think it's going to be something  sexual.  I don't know. 
[00:27:00]  It might be, because you would think a girl breaks up with a guy, she's going to want to  get out there and get back on that horse, as they say, or suck its dick.  Oh, God, stop it, of course.  Just shove some feed and oats in that thing and let the horse have at it.  Fill your vag with some little green crispy apples.  Yes, it's very hard to hold your vag flat, though, so it doesn't bite you like your hand  with a sugar cube.  Oh, very dangerous.  Let's hear what Rocky thinks the answer might be.  What is it? 
[00:27:30]  1-800-222-0985.  First to get it right, we're going to get you into the Quiznos Spotlight Lounge.  Week from Wednesday, starring Jason Castro from American Idol.  I'm actually excited to meet him.  What is that?  Who is he?  He's from American Idol.  He had the dreadlocks.  He was quite the heartthrob.  He got voted off.  Apparently, Sue is all taken by.  Was dreadlocks on a white guy?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you know, that's all the rage. 
[00:28:00]  Can we have her response one more time, Dan?  Yes, I definitely want to hear.  That was her response.  Tremendously terrible.  And Castro from American Idol.  I'm actually excited to meet him.  We'll stay at 8 a.m.  He's so hippy-dippy, California, ukulele, dreadlocked, dude.  You know who he is.  Here's a couple of these.  Oh, my God.  And they put echo on her voice?  Because she sounds like a man, first of all.  She's really like, oh, I really want to see him. 
[00:28:30]  Her sing-y song talking pattern.  Oh, boy.  She's wacky.  Dude, you know who he is.  Here's a couple of the responses we got on our Facebook page.  Lose weight.  That was my guess.  A third of the women lose weight after they break up.  Just think about your own breakups.  What did you do?  One-third of the women poll said they would do this right after a breakup.  Get revenge.  Yeah.  Okay, that'd be part of it.  Sleep with somebody else.  Yeah.  One-third of the women poll said they would do this after a breakup. 
[00:29:00]  Get a Brazilian.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Don't give him any.  Yeah, I did.  What?  One-800-222-0185.  Why not give him any ideas?  I thought it was going to be.  All right.  We'll call us right now.  Why not give him any ideas?  She got all.  She was taken aback.  Don't give him any ideas.  Why not?  Do you know who a Brazilian is?  An unclipped cock?  Yeah.  Madonna got herself a Brazilian.  Yeah, of course.  The Brazilian waxing.  They want to purdy up that thing so when they're back out on the market, guys look at it and 
[00:29:30]  go, wow, that's nice.  That might have been a little far.  Oh, Rocky.  I like it when my asshole looks like Dan Haggerty's face.  Why would we want to get a Brazilian and ruin that?  I like when I drop a log and it kind of hangs in a hairnet under my cheeks.  Every man likes that.  Yeah, Sue got a little, wow, that was a little wild.  Yeah, that's a thing.  Because you got to think, there are moms and kids driving to school listening to Rocky and  Sue and now the embarrassment of a mother having to tell her child what a Brazilian is. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  As, you know, the girl is being dropped off at school with fucking completely clean shaved  pussy.  They're all doing it now.  It's all the rave.  Of course they are.  The second it grows in, it comes off.  I don't understand it.  She's got a K for Kanye carved into her pubes.  That's great.  Answer to the poll question and we reach an exciting conclusion.  Well, because, you know, when you have a question like this, one of the beautiful things to do 
[00:30:30]  in radio is to ask a question that you'd think would just have a common answer, but then wait  and see where it goes.  Because obviously a question this bland would have to have an exciting answer to make it  worth doing, right?  Yeah.  So there'd be some kind of twist at the end.  Is it get a new hairdo?  Oh, you mean one not like a bull dyke lesbian?  Okay.  She has nice hair.  Grow it in.  Oh, does she?  Yeah.  It just kind of sprouts up.  It looks like right after you plant corn. 
[00:31:00]  That's what comes up.  She looks like every actress who was like a really hot teenager who's battling cancer later  in life.  Holy shit.  Could be any kind.  Sure.  All right.  Answer to the poll question.  Exciting conclusion.  Here we go.  Do they get a makeover?  Get a makeover.  A little more specific.  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good.  What was that?  That's the whole thing we did.  It's a joke that we do. 
[00:31:30]  Not really thinking they do that.  Sue does it.  But Sue the hole did that.  More specific.  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good guess.  But that is incorrect.  It does not get a makeover.  What the fuck is she doing?  It's kind of on the right track.  All right.  We have another Michelle.  I know.  So many.  Which one?  This is Michelle number two.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Michelle.  Michelle number two.  Okay.  Good.  One third of the women poll said they do this right after a breakup.  What is it?  Call their girlfriends or best friends? 
[00:32:00]  Call their girlfriends.  No.  Because that would be your support.  But unfortunately, no.  Well, I mean, maybe they do, but that's not the answer that we're looking for here.  One third of the women do this right after they break up with their significant other.  Okay.  This is Michelle we haven't talked to yet.  Mm-hmm.  Michelle number three.  Michelle number three.  Hello.  This is horrible.  First thing they do after a breakup.  One third of the women polled said they do this.  It is?  Cut their hair.  Cut their hair.  Cut their hair. 
[00:32:30]  You are correct, sir.  Yes.  Cut their hair.  Cut their hair.  Yes, it is.  Cut their hair.  Yay.  Of course I got it.  You got the answer.  Woo-hoo.  You did.  Of course I do.  I've destroyed so many relationships.  I know what these bitches do.  Shave their head.  Next week, they look like Moe Howard.  Shave their head, put his swastik in between their eyes and just preach for her.  Oh, my God.  How do you forget Charles Manson's name?  You went preach for her and just decided to bail out.  Yeah, Charles Manson. 
[00:33:00]  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Wow, they have better sound effects than we do.  But that's what happens when you listen to management creatively.  Put the echo in.  That's good.  Yeah, get the echo.  It's not good.  It makes it seem like you're bigger.  Is that what they say?  I think so.  Yeah.  Makes it seem a little more larger than life.  Can we see some more pictures of them?  Sure.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm getting tired of that one.  I got soft from that one.  I need a new one to get a little more in my step.  Uh, let's see. 
[00:33:30]  Rocky talks about his day at the fair.  Yes.  Sue bitches at him.  That's going to be, uh, the next clip.  Wow.  What could his day at the fair be like?  In Wilkes-Barre.  Yeah.  A fair in Wilkes-Barre.  That sounds like fun.  Let's hear Rocky talking about his day.  From 98.5 KRZ.  When I got home Saturday, I was food drunk.  Oh, you know what?  What?  I'm a little disappointed.  The plan was Saturday.  I was going to do a deep fried on a stick tour of the Bluesburg Fair. 
[00:34:00]  Okay.  Just listen to the title.  Deep fried on a stick.  Okay.  The problem was, I was being escorted by the fair princess, who happens to be our receptionist,  Moe Diggs.  No.  And I was...  Can I talk to her?  Hold on.  What the fuck is she doing?  This is a joke, right?  What?  You actually got, like, Janine to play the whole, and, like, this was put together in a studio.  This can't be real. 
[00:34:30]  This is not Janine.  That's Sue.  From Rocky and Sue.  Sue, I never thought our whole thing was too accurate.  It's not funny now, because it's just an accurate depiction.  It's a complete recreation.  Yes.  There's no more irony to it.  See, the thing is, like, for Sue, if you can't think of a funny joke right off the top  of your head, maybe a funny noise.  Or just repeat what he said.  Oh, fried food on a stick. 
[00:35:00]  Right, but do it with, like, a little inflection in your voice.  So people kind of...  Now I stop, but I'm gonna...  Yeah.  She's acting like it's outrageous, and she can't believe somebody would eat fried food  on a stick at a fair.  At a fair.  Yeah.  What are you going to get?  Stop.  I can see if he said he had sushi at a fair.  If you're an asshole, you're going to get food poisoning.  It's a fried stick.  That's when you eat corn dogs.  Yeah.  Oh, let's hear the thrilling conclusion of this one.  I was being escorted by the fair princess, who happens to be our receptionist, Moe Diggs.  No, no, no, no.  And I... 
[00:35:30]  Can I talk here?  Just let me state my case.  You just got to lay it on her, and I think that's unfair.  Go ahead.  Every time we've passed another food booth, she was saying, like, oh, man, you got to  try that.  Well, okay.  Oh, look.  That ice cream over there, they make it right here at the fair.  It's the best.  So...  You've never had pizza until you've had that pizza over there.  And she would know.  Uh-huh.  She won't shut the fuck up.  He hates her.  It sounds at least like he hates her.  Because he did give her a little bit of a, hey, I'm trying to make my point here.  He didn't just go make my point.  He goes, can I talk here? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  He sounds like he really doesn't like her.  Can I talk here?  Oh, domestic dispute would be great at this point, where he gets pulled in and she's  got a giant shiner.  Oh, boy.  They really do sound like a married couple.  Well, yeah, I think they might...  Right before a gunshot.  Yeah, the La Matas.  She is really, I mean, terrible.  But that's just some of the type of thing that you could hear on the Rocky and Sue show.  They talk, they cover the gamut of different topics that the Wilkes-Barre people want to 
[00:36:30]  know about.  Yeah, they really do have their finger on the pulse of Wilkes-Barre.  Yeah.  The people there and their concerns and issues.  I don't know how many of these we'll actually get to.  We could do them all.  Who knows?  There's like 34 seconds.  4 seconds, minute, whatever.  Rocky and Sue take a hilarious, fun, and interesting phone call.  That is not...  Do they?  Oh.  Can I talk here?  Go ahead.  Go ahead. 
[00:37:00]  Fun, interesting phone call.  Okay.  I'm right.  No.  Look, you fucking bitch.  Shut up or I'll whack you with a shovel.  Dude, he can't get his hands out.  No, he can't.  We get it.  You're in the studio.  We know you're there, miss.  You don't have to jibber jabber all the time.  I think she's afraid that like she ceases to exist if a noise isn't coming out.  Which management will hear and go, you know, I heard you get three words out without that  annoying bitch chiming in.  It sounded pretty good.  Why don't we get rid of her? 
[00:37:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Excuse me, Sue.  Yeah.  I need a house with a bigger kitchen because I like to.  Oh.  No.  The cooking.  Is it about the cooking?  You like to.  Do you like the stove?  Well, look at the bedrooms.  Yuck.  All right.  Hilarious, fun, interesting phone call.  That is not a waste of time about someone getting married.  Yes.  Okay.  And we're closing out the show with a quick phone call from Janie in Edwardsville. 
[00:38:00]  What's happening, Janie?  Not much.  Just getting ready to get married.  Oh, really?  Just getting married.  Just getting married.  Well, so we will have something in common until the end of time.  Your birthday, my birthday, and your anniversary.  Same day.  Yeah, one of our groomsmen's birthdays is today, too.  So we're going to embarrass him at the wedding and make him start the chicken dance.  All right.  So who's the lucky guy who you're getting married to?  Garrett.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.  You and Garrett.  Garrett. 
[00:38:30]  I can't, too.  He can't get a word out without her fucking chiming in.  Or the phone caller can't even talk without her just chiming in the whole time.  Oh, God.  It's Jacktober.  It's Rocky and Sue.  It is.  Oh, look.  Let me try this.  Hi, Drew.  Whoa.  Oh, hello.  Hello.  How you doing?  You've been looking at the Rocky and Sue website playing along with us?  Oh. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  So what did you notice?  Can I speak, please?  Yeah, go ahead.  A blur.  Yay.  What I've noticed is the picture of those two, the only thing that's missing is a swarthy  man's unclipped penis.  Because with the hands spread out like that, it looks like every cover of every interracial  porn video I've ever seen in my life.  Oh, no.  Actually, she does look like she's going to accept a nice, delicious load. 
[00:39:30]  I know.  I just want him to explain that a little further.  Yeah.  Go ahead, dude.  Explain.  We're not sure what you mean.  I'm going to head on.  Mr. Marshall.  Mr. Marshall.  Terrible.  Screw him.  I figured he might be pertinent to the subject at hand.  Now, watch Rocky and Sue do Jocktober and say man calls with pointless, overly explained  black porno joke.  They'd be right.  They sure would.  All right. 
[00:40:00]  Rocky and Sue do a hilarious break on transportation.  Yeah.  It's like they're going over some of the news stories and they talk about a new method of  transportation.  Can we count the longest this guy can talk without a noise from her?  Without a peep from her.  That would be good.  That would be good.  A stopwatch.  Anybody?  Okay.  Someone time this and we'll see how long you talk.  Transportation.  I hope it's punching and kicking Sue down the street. 
[00:40:30]  That's her mode of transportation.  Rocky just assaults her down the street.  Rocky and Sue.  Hilarious break on transportation.  Honda says that they are ready to revolutionize the way we get from point A to point B.  I want to see this thing.  Maybe you can Google this.  A new electric unicycle.  I know what you're thinking.  Who the hell can ride a unicycle?  They say this will not fall over.  I don't know.  So again, I got to see it. 
[00:41:00]  Why won't it fall over?  They're calling it a personal mobility device.  Just been unveiled by the company in Tokyo.  Okay.  Raise your hand if you have a segue.  No.  I don't see any hands going up.  No, no, no, no.  This is the next one.  You know, amazing invention doesn't fall over.  Come on.  That's what they said about the segue, too.  And things like so dangerous.  You think so?  Yeah.  I don't.  I had a chance to get up close and personal with one down at the Stroudsburg.  No, where was it?  Tandersville Mall.  When I was down there, down at the crossing. 
[00:41:30]  The local.  Talking to, you know, one of the security guys.  He had one.  He was a master on that thing.  Well, that's like Paul Blart Mall Cop.  He had a segue, too.  Wow.  It was awesome.  I loved it.  I really enjoyed it.  I wanted to ride it, but he couldn't give it up.  6.34.  Let's take a look at traffic.  Here's Rusty Thunder.  Rusty Thunder?  Fender.  Oh, Rusty.  Wait, wait.  Rusty Fender does the traffic?  Of course he does.  I want to know, Rusty, who does the music break? 
[00:42:00]  Dirty Sanchez is coming in now.  Yes.  To help clean up.  She talks and he doesn't interrupt her, but whenever he talks, he can go for three or  four seconds before she makes a noise.  Yeah, that wasn't any longer than probably three seconds of him talking, yet she was able  to do the whole preface to the horribly boring story.  You don't think that was interesting?  The electric unicycle?  She can't figure out how it stays up.  No.  How about you just fucking do a tenth of a second of research on the web and you'll find  out. 
[00:42:30]  If she just read any part of the article that wasn't the headline?  Yes.  Maybe it would have said.  Whatever.  I'm not even going to argue the point.  Rocky and Sue do a phone topic.  Their listeners are as fun as they are.  Yeah.  You know.  Oh, gosh.  You bring up at the same time of the day, it's time for the phone topic.  Yeah.  So this means you do the phone sweeper, get the callers to start calling in and answer  your question.  Got it.  Don't waste your energy screaming at that driver.  The car horn.  That's her actually. 
[00:43:00]  That was her voice.  A little grating.  Do you need that wake up with the fucking horrible traffic sound effects?  Don't waste your energy screaming at that driver in front of you.  Call the show right now.  Right now.  What are they talking about?  1-800-222-0985.  And what we're talking about this morning.  Handling.  Joe Snedeker got a ticket from out of state.  Can I just say that siren you hear is on the radio. 
[00:43:30]  It's not behind you.  Yeah, it's coming from the studio.  Just so you know.  All right.  Joe Snedeker got a ticket from out of state in a rental car.  Came in the mail yesterday.  Yes.  Should he pay?  Uh-huh.  Should he pay?  We'll start with you, Roger.  You're on the Rocky and Sue show.  How about advice for Snedeker?  I think he should pay it.  I got a ticket coming through Ohio.  Ripped it up.  And lost my license for seven months.  Ooh.  Ouch.  No, that's not fun.  That's not good.  What, the show?  That's how we feel listening to it. 
[00:44:00]  Ooh, ouch.  The, uh, wow.  First the sound effect.  And then the fact that we used to actually just out of nowhere play siren sound effect  to fuck with people in their cars.  It worked.  It worked fantastically.  But did you let them know just in case?  By the way, this is on your radio.  Yes, yes.  Uh, hold it.  Just distracted for a second.  Is this the news?  Wow.  That's, yeah.  Why is a stripper doing a pole dance on the Channel 11 News here in New York? 
[00:44:30]  And not in our studio.  Yeah.  Look, look.  That's fucking fruit.  Absolutely true.  We cannot have that done.  Oh.  Did you see the camel toe on her?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Fantastic.  So she's doing, I guess this is under the guise of a strip exercise.  You should have seen the camel toe.  Wow.  It was hot.  They probably told her to keep the spread eagle away from the camera.  Like, she's doing the pole split.  I've seen all these moves.  Look, look.  See, the camera faded out. 
[00:45:00]  Now look.  Oh my God.  Camel toe.  Fucking hot, man.  Huge ass crack.  Look at the deep crack in camel toe.  God.  She's working this pole.  They put a fucking stripper pole.  It's probably our old one in the Channel 11 News here in New York.  And she is working this pole like you would see in any strip club.  Wearing, like, boy shorts and a very short little sports workout top.  Yeah, workout top.  She's so hot.  Who is she?  She's pretty fucking hot.  I love her.  You think she strips?  I want her to be my wife. 
[00:45:30]  She's probably a workout teacher or aerobics instructor.  Yeah, she's just doing kind of an aerobics thing.  Like, but, but dude, it's the fucking news.  And what if we said, yeah, we want to get a pole in here and just have a girl, like, dance around.  And since it's radio, maybe she could take her top off.  Well, we could probably get that done, but we'll definitely have to draw the shades.  Draw the shades.  What about penetration?  God.  I miss penetration.  Me too.  Penetration was so much fun.  Boy, did we have just a variety of things we used to shove in there. 
[00:46:00]  Cell phones to see if they worked.  Girl smoked out of it.  We shot a bottle rocket out of one.  God, penetration's fun.  Vagina's so versatile.  Yes!  It's like a cup holder.  It's not just for a cup.  You put change in it.  You put your cell phone in there.  You do everything with a cup holder.  It's not just for cups.  Oh, guys.  Oh.  Oh, Sam.  Sam's like Sue.  You guys are too much.  What's her shirt, Sam?  I'm trying to read the shirt. 
[00:46:30]  Where are these girls from?  Wow.  Yeah, they got to give them a good plug.  Yeah, she's now dancing again.  She stepped off.  I thought the segment was over.  Different girl.  She is good at this, man.  Is that a different girl?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Cut from the swath.  Wow.  They're doing these really aerobic...  Gymnastics moves, really.  Yeah, she's like doing a...  Pole superstars.  Pole superstars?  I think that's what it says.  Yeah.  They are hot.  I guarantee they're health instructors or they're fitness instructors.  Yeah, but the whole pole dancing thing is... 
[00:47:00]  To work out for them, no.  Is it really, though, Jim?  But they really do teach you to work out like a...  Oh, no.  Come on.  We don't need to see that.  It really is.  What happened to spinning?  It really is.  That's the girl...  Spinning was fun, and I'll keep interrupting.  Because a pole is just...  It makes you think dirty thoughts, and I don't think that's right.  It's actually not what you think.  No, it is, to me.  It's actually just...  Shot it.  It's New York City's ultimate pole dance competition. 
[00:47:30]  It's today, October 1st, at the Highline Ballroom in New York City.  It's just a stripping competition.  It's a stripping...  A pole dance competition.  Are they clothed when they do it?  I guess they would be.  I guess they...  Yeah, I don't know.  I'm trying to look for one.  What a tease.  Who wants to see girls on a pole if they're not fucking naked, though?  Because when they do those moves, where they do the split, that's the good part.  That's when you go, wow.  That's what I came to see.  But it is a good workout.  Yes, good point, Sam.  Thank you.  And good news for everybody, it benefits single parents out there. 
[00:48:00]  Go figure that one out.  How many of those friggin' C-section scars you see on the dancers and lasagna bellies?  All proceeds go to women who had shitty childhoods.  And cocaine.  Pole super...  A little distraction there from Rocky and Sue.  I guess this is the last one.  I'm sorry.  But don't worry.  It's jock-tober.  All month long.  So we'll have plenty of these. 
[00:48:30]  Sue starts to get a little edgy.  What?  That's right.  I better read on.  That's right.  But don't worry.  She's just kidding.  Yes, she's joking.  Oh, that's Sue.  See, she gets you thinking.  Maybe she's going to go somewhere.  And she zigzags.  That's why she's good, though.  Yep.  Do we need to take any more calls on this?  Yes, of course.  You asked.  We're talking.  All right.  Missy, you're on the Rocky and Sue show.  What's Seneca do?  Hey, absolutely.  Absolutely.  He should pay.  He did something wrong.  He was speeding and he got caught. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, but you know what?  I mean, Roger was right.  You guys, it's true.  He should pay.  He did something wrong.  I mean, it would be like the same thing.  We went over to Jersey and just because it's of a different state and we got a ticket.  Yeah.  You know, we'd still have to pay.  I'm not paying that one either.  No, I'm kidding.  Oh, I'm just kidding.  Sue, we'll come visit you on Sundays.  We will.  Oh, I'm just kidding.  And that means I'll have to drive you all around when you get your license taken away.  Yeah.  I'm just kidding.  She makes fucking Pee Wee Herman noises. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Ah!  Ha ha!  Not going to pay it.  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha!  Try to talk.  Ha ha!  So, it sounds like we have a really interesting call.  Oh, I was being the character.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  Well, that's the first show for Jocktober.  That's how we kick off Jocktober.  Rocky and Sue.  Oof.  The definitive hole and the emasculated poor son of a bitch that has to sit there with her.  She was really getting a little edgy, though, there with the caller, you know? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Making her feel bad.  And what was he suggesting?  That maybe she would be in prison for not paying a ticket?  That's right.  And he would come and visit her?  Yeah.  Like she's doing a stint?  And of course you've got to pay out of state tickets.  It's not fucking 1930.  I think they keep tabs on it.  How will they do the interstate travel?  To get you.  Well, they don't have to.  They send you a letter that says, hey, you've got a ticket here.  Pay it, asshole.  Oh.  Yeah.  You know, it's the future. 
[00:50:30]  People cross state lines of things.  But it'll take months to get a letter from state to state.  I see what you're trying to do here, Sue.  Don't, don't beat me.  Don't beat me.  I meant to do that.  Okay.  So, Sue, would you pay it?  Okay.  Oh, Sue.  Let's take a...  I'm trying to use that phone.  I'm sorry.  What are you eating?  Right.  Chicken.  You keep interrupting me. 
[00:51:00]  I meant to do that.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Just reading something.  A lot of fuck-offs coming in.  I think somebody needs to be bounced out of one of the chat rooms.  But I can't do that.  You're going to have to take care of business yourself and deal with people.  Because Opie's not here today.  Yeah.  He has a sore throat.  So, he's taking the day to recoup and relax.  So, the chat rooms, whatever things that are usually moderated a little bit, it's total anarchy now. 
[00:51:30]  So, have fun.  Just call them unclipped savages.  And perhaps they'll leave the room.  Have fun with that.  Also, October 1st, today, people have been reminding me.  So, it is a wonderful day in my life.  I will remember this day forever.  Happy birthday!  Thank you, Jimmy. 
[00:52:00]  Nope.  This is my day of freedom.  Freedom!  After I've been disemboweled, I yell freedom because I'm done.  No more paying.  All those years, the listeners stuck through and listened to my happy horseshit on my comments on marriage, on divorce.  Whenever people have been married and call in and ask for suggestions and advice, I hate it. 
[00:52:30]  So, it's because, you know, obviously people know I got divorced.  Yes.  Back in the late 90s.  Let me repeat that.  I was divorced in the late 90s.  And today, October 1st, 2009, I make my last payment. 
[00:53:00]  Done.  Done.  Done.  I wipe my hands clean.  That was...  I remember before...  I never knew your ex...  Oh, when you were really married.  Yeah.  But I remember when I first started coming on the show, you guys were talking and Ope was reading an article out of the paper.  The New York Post had quoted some sexual stuff.  Yes!  I'm a hubba!  Oh, Jim!  And that was right around that time.  I can't believe that's 10 years ago, man.  10 years ago, I sat in that courtroom with Dominic Barber there across from me, giving me the old, you know, cross-examine. 
[00:53:30]  And the New York Post and Daily News writers were sitting in the little gallery there with their little notepads, jotting down notes.  And I believe I was asked...  What news article was it?  I was asked, when was your date of your wedding?  And I went, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, Mr. Marsh. 
[00:54:00]  I could not, for the sake of me, remember.  I would be horrible on the stand.  There are people that get on the stand and they're like, smooth as silk, very good, make a great witness.  I made an awful witness.  Did you?  I was horrible.  I can't remember anything.  I'm just sitting there all nervous, sweating.  And he started getting into, you know, some of the reasons that perhaps the marriage was not going as well as it did for previous years. 
[00:54:30]  And it was a little frisky.  There was a little frisk going on there.  Actually, it was in the newspaper, so I'm going to talk about there.  There was allegations of maybe a threesome.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  And boy, did that get the little pencils going on the New York Post and Daily News, guys.  So, yeah, I just went like, and I realized what an awful witness I was.  And I just said, all right, hold on.  Hold on. 
[00:55:00]  Maybe we can, you know, talk this out, sort it out in a room somewhere.  And then it was, you know, hammered out without the need of an actual trial.  Can you say this?  In the 10 years, did you pay out over a million dollars?  I cannot state figures, facts and figures.  Things like that.  The whole thing has a bunch of stipulations.  Right, right, right.  You're allowed to talk about what you're allowed.  You're not.  This, that, the other thing.  How about this? 
[00:55:30]  If I knew the figure, would it anger and disturb me?  Yes.  It would anger and disturb you.  It has been very angering to me.  Sure.  Very stressful.  It's just a horrible thing to have to go through.  Divorce in this country is just an abominable display of sexual fucking discrimination. 
[00:56:00]  And favoritism.  Yes.  Women want all the glass ceilings taken down, completely equal pay for equal work, equal  rights, equal this, everyone's equal, equal, equal, equal.  You go into that divorce court, you are fucked in the asshole.  They want the ceilings taken down, all that stuff, except in cases of custody and alimony.  Yeah, yeah.  Anything to do with divorce, they want to put on an apron that says world's best mom, even  if they don't have no kids, and then sit there and cry about how incapable they are of doing 
[00:56:30]  anything.  That seems to be what women like to do during divorce cases.  I'm incapable of supporting myself and my child or children, and I need the man that I  was married to that we now do not like each other anymore, for whatever reason we're getting  a divorce, but I still need him to pay for me because I am incompetent and cannot possibly 
[00:57:00]  get a job that could support myself.  Why couldn't, if there's kids, it's one thing, but without kids, why not in a case, I can  almost understand for the first-  I have no kids, by the way, no kids, no house, no nothing.  First year, maybe two, the woman has to get on her feet because the guy's been the breadwinner,  she was doing her home duties, but there's no children, so there's no reason that within  a year, possibly two on the long haul, she can't get a fucking job.  Why does she need to fucking, to bloodsuck off the guy for however long it is? 
[00:57:30]  I don't understand that at all.  It's embarrassing to women, I think.  It's an embarrassment that in this day and age where it's politically incorrect in the  workplace to make any type of sexual joke.  They'll get you fucking thrown out of your job by going to human resources.  They'll sue a company for not getting equal pay for the same job, yet the second they 
[00:58:00]  step in that divorce court, all bets are off.  It's back to being fucking 1920, and it's all on the guy to support this poor waif that  can do nothing for herself anymore.  And like you said, yeah, perhaps maybe a year, two years, things like that.  Um, uh, fine, but to have somebody actually have to pay for a number of years, uh, let 
[00:58:30]  alone a decade with no kids is, is complete insanity.  Yeah, it's just insanity.  Oh, we got a little, um, 1999 Anthony was just getting a divorce, uh, history might remember  the Euro is established.  There was no Euro when I was married.  Dow closes over 10,000 for the first time.  Ah, SpongeBob makes his, uh, debut.  Microsoft releases Windows 98, second edition. 
[00:59:00]  That was good.  Worked about as well as my marriage did, by the way.  Uh, Star Wars Episode I is released.  Hmm.  A little, uh, website, uh, Napster debuts.  That was the debut of Napster?  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, see?  Well, I was married.  I didn't know about Napster.  Didn't.  I just thought that.  Now when you were sleepy.  Oh, hold on up, hold on up, hold on up.  If I didn't have water in my mouth, I would have leaped over the console and bitten you.  You should have spit it out at me and bitten me anyway. 
[00:59:30]  Napster.  Uh, Bush announces he'll run for president.  Uh, Stephen King was hit by that car.  Wow.  That's it.  I feel, I felt your pain around the same time, Stephen.  Uh, Viacom and CBS.  It's merged.  Worked out well for the radio division.  Uh, and the celebrity deaths of, uh, that great year, 1999, when, uh, my first got my  divorce.  Uh, Owen Hart and Dana Plato both, uh, died. 
[01:00:00]  Wow.  Two biggies.  We lost that year, did we?  Holy shit.  Those are the two you can come up with.  Ha ha.  But that is fucking like, come on.  It's a long time ago.  Yeah.  But today, God, I was waiting for like this day for so long.  It's just, all right.  Another, imagine sitting there.  Cause there were many times I would just be like, all right, just five more years.  I'm halfway there.  Five more years to go.  And it's like, ah, three years, two. 
[01:00:30]  One year.  Yeah, years I'm talking.  You're getting a raise.  That's pretty much what it amounts to.  Just in time to pay those Obama taxes.  I get fucked no matter what happens.  Ha ha ha.  Jesus.  Poor aunt.  Ha ha ha.  Uh, but, uh, some people are suggesting, um, was it worth the price?  Yes.  Ha ha ha. 
[01:01:00]  Yes, it was.  I have had my share of pussy that would fucking make people cry.  Would knock your socks off.  Oh.  Great.  So getting out of a marriage, um, was very, very good for me, I think.  Cause I was really not a happy, uh, guy during that time.  Like I'm Mr. Joy now.  I yell all the time, apparently.  Yes.  But, uh.  You're a gun nut. 
[01:01:30]  You're a fucking bundle of nerves.  It's funny.  I wasn't happy then as opposed to the fucking, the picture of emotional and spiritual health  you see now.  Yeah.  Well, it, um.  I sit next to a spiritual vacuum.  Yeah.  But, uh, no, I'm just glad that's over.  I was able to, I remember one time, I remember, um, I want, I want, and this was back in like  90, I guess 98.  This is just before things went, uh, haywire. 
[01:02:00]  Uh, I wanted to get a cell phone.  And now this is, you know, 1998.  People had like the star tax.  I think Opie had gotten a star tax.  And I was like, fuck man, I want a cell phone.  And I was told no.  No.  Why?  I don't know.  I was, and then I said, well, cause I was very, very like, oh, let's not make any waves.  I'll be okay.  Okie doke. 
[01:02:30]  I was told I could get a car phone for emergencies.  Like if the car broke down, one of those giant things you put in with the little corkscrew  pig dick antenna on the back of the windshield, uh, window, the back window.  I was told that that would be okay.  But, um, under no circumstances was I to get a, a cell phone.  Why did you just say, shut up?  I'm getting one.  Uh, because Anthony was one of the biggest pussies in the world, in the world, up until 
[01:03:00]  I got divorced.  Then like all bets off.  I had to change my whole lifestyle and everything.  Just change it.  Cause it was too, uh, I was very like, all right.  Okay.  Well, it's pretty emasculated.  You just didn't want to fight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was tired of any confrontation, conflict, fighting.  Um, so yeah, I would give in and be like, boo, boo. 
[01:03:30]  So I got divorced.  Uh, well, actually when it, you know, the stuff started, you know, legal wrangling started  going on.  That's when I got my first cell phone.  Hmm.  I think I called up and went, ha ha.  I'm calling from the street.  I'm walking.  What a maverick.  I was wild.  How annoying.  You couldn't get a cell phone.  I know.  Don't you hate marriage?  There were so many things.  And I think a lot of married guys go through it.  You just kind of, you write it off as like, well, you know something, ah, this is, this 
[01:04:00]  is my life.  This is what I stepped into.  And these poor fuckers that are in a bad situation and have like kids so they can't  leave.  Their whole like existence is based on being married.  So perhaps he's, he's, he's got a, a mutual business with the wife.  So he knows that, that, that would be destroyed.  I mean, just having to live and be that unhappy to be with somebody you're not happy with and  have to, I remember getting like yelled at for not taking the garbage out. 
[01:04:30]  And it's like, well, why?  The pail's there.  Could you take it out?  Well, you, did you have jobs?  I'm at work.  Did you both have jobs at equal pay?  We're close to it?  No.  No.  In Massachusetts, when I first started up there, um, yeah, there was like, uh, you  know, she worked, I worked, I wasn't making a lot of money at all because I was making  like, you know, $28,000 a year or something like that at AF, like the first six months. 
[01:05:00]  And Bruce, he gave me a raise.  28, five.  It's a little more, not much, but it was, uh, you know, she, she, she was working.  Yeah.  And then we got to New York, penned a better deal.  Things started going a little better and, uh, you know, she didn't have to work, but  I would always assume if the guy went out and worked and made enough money where the  woman didn't have to work, that perhaps the woman could pick up, you know, those chores, 
[01:05:30]  those things, uh, the housekeeping things, um, um, in total.  And, and, you know, I wouldn't have to come home and take the garbage out or get yelled  at for not taking the garbage out for what I assumed to be just the ability to make me  do that, you know, sort of like a, all right, I still got, you know, cause some women I think  are like that.  All women are like, like, like I still want to have something over you. 
[01:06:00]  I still want to have the ability to go, Hey, you, you, you, Hey, take your goddamn hands  off.  No, you take, take the garbage out, do this.  I'm still, I'm still running this show.  I will say you won.  You fucking won in the long run.  You won.  You got out.  All right.  You had to pay.  It sucks.  You got no kids.  All you, you wound up in a fucking multi-million dollar mansion with guns and you fuck a lot 
[01:06:30]  of broads.  The winner, ladies and gentlemen, your fucking dick smells like eight different vaginas at  any given time.  You got fucking millions.  You live in a mansion.  You won.  You drink whatever you want.  You hang out with your friends, whatever you want.  No one.  You want a fucking movie theater and a karaoke machine.  You're like a giant child.  You have a fucking keg, a truck. 
[01:07:00]  You go shooting guns.  You're right.  Whatever you want to do.  I feel good about that.  Jimmy.  Thank you.  You fucking rent sports cars with your fucking dopey cop friend and speed.  No one tells you what to do.  You fucking won, man.  You know something?  Perhaps I owe.  That was my debt of gratitude for saying, you know something?  If I didn't go through that crap, I might still be the, you know, submissive kind of not  go out there and do whatever the fuck I want to do kind of guy. 
[01:07:30]  Or maybe the time you were married, you would have done something stupid like knock some  girl up hot and all of a sudden she has a kid.  It's all these years later.  She's fat.  Oh, I'd have kicked her in the gut.  Who wouldn't have?  Yeah, right down the stairs.  Fucking, something on a fucking hidden dragon.  Or crouching dragon.  Crouching tiger hidden dragon.  Something's crouching.  Something's hiding.  And something's falling out.  You fucking won, Ant.  Ah, wow.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  You won.  All right. 
[01:08:00]  That's a nice little bit of perspective put on it on this October 1st, the last day of  my payments.  No one tells you what to do.  It's wonderful.  Ever.  There is this fear, though, that always resides, I think, in any guy that is done, that it's  not done.  You get this fucking think, thought, like, am I going to get a subpoena?  That, you know, this, that, the other thing. 
[01:08:30]  I don't know.  There's a multitude of things that might come up, where, whether they're win, lose, or  draw, you still have to pay legal fees, things like that.  Like, that is always going to be this constant vulture over my shoulder thought that it's  not over.  Any legal fees you have to pay, I don't know what you paid a month, but I'm guessing any  small legal fees you have to pay are not going to be what you were paying a month.  No, no, no.  I understand that, but it's, it's not even just the money part of it. 
[01:09:00]  It's the, um, just the feeling of being harassed at times where you're like, you know, if I  have to, if I have to go down a goddamn center street one more fucking time over this, uh,  it's just unfathomable.  I can't imagine walking in there again, looking again at these people, uh, having to sit before  a judge that just uses a slide rule to, uh, uh, figure things out instead of actually listening 
[01:09:30]  to testimony, just things like that.  Like, like that to me is a huge fear I have right now.  Um, yeah, well, let's just say as somebody who's been through certain situations, it's  natural to feel that way when it's done, but then you realize, wow, it really is over.  And any other little inklings where it pops up, that's all it is.  They're like little flash fires that are put out quickly.  It's not like the big blaze.  You are, look, the big blaze financially, you can out litigate most regular civilians if 
[01:10:00]  they choose to litigate with you.  Because they also have to pay for lawyers, not just you, they have to pay for them too.  And no lawyer's doing shit for free.  No, no, no, not, not in those cases.  That's for sure.  Uh, Spencer, the trucker, I guess Spencer, the trucker says he wants to talk about divorce.  What's up, Spencer?  Oh, not much, man.  Spencer.  I make, I make 85 grand a year.  I pay $20,000 a year in taxes and $20,000 a year in child support. 
[01:10:30]  So 50% of your money out the window.  Well, that's child support.  Out the window.  No, dude, I've been divorced five years.  My daughter's nine.  I still have nine more years.  Now, I'm not even, I'm not even going to, uh, thanks, thanks a lot, Spencer.  It puts a whole nother thing on it, though.  I'm not going to go into child support.  Right.  Like, that's a whole nother fucking animal.  You got kids.  Uh, sorry, Charlie.  Ha ha.  You got to pay.  Yep.  Now you got to pay for your fucking kid.  That's regardless of your wife.  If she was a fucking cunt on wheels or the nicest woman in the world. 
[01:11:00]  Or you were nice or you were a cheating bastard.  Whatever, whatever it is.  Now you got to pay for your kid.  She's nine.  Happy nine more years, at least.  And that's if the money actually goes to the kid.  Right.  Well, that's, that's another thing, too.  A lot of these child support cases, uh, the, the wife winds up kicking it up so high because  she's, you know, siphoning off, uh, the child support money and buying herself some shoes  and clothes and things like that.  But it's very hard to argue that point.  Um, when you're just a guy and a girl and you are married and you own no real estate, um, 
[01:11:30]  no real, uh, money to speak of, uh, in terms of, you know, real bulk liquid assets and no  kids, uh, leased vehicles, things like that, there's, there's no reason.  And especially in an age range where, you know, this isn't a divorce happening, uh, a  lot of times where these women are 55, 60 years old going, well, I got to get in the  workplace now. 
[01:12:00]  I'm talking women that are well in their, their, uh, um, uh, early thirties, mid thirties,  even where they can absolutely get out.  Um, uh, maybe use some of the money they have gotten, uh, in the divorce in some type of  job training, schooling over the years, whatever.  And then come out of it as a very productive member of society, uh, um, uh, supporting  themselves, building a career, perhaps.  A lot of them don't want to, though.  They want to have the same lack of financial pressure and, I mean, and lack of having to 
[01:12:30]  do shit to earn the living.  It's fucking sickening.  Yeah.  It's not 1930.  Women are paid fairly equal.  Yeah.  And they should be.  Oh yeah, we actually, Danny's right.  Well, look at us.  We're crazy, chatty little Cathy's.  Yeah.  Uh, we do have to take a break.  I guess.  It's 725.  I swear to you, I would just keep fucking talking until like 1030.  I, I, I, I would, but, but we, the thing is like, we got to chop these shows up in pieces 
[01:13:00]  for some reason.  I don't know.  I don't stay for those meetings.  I stay for the encore.  For the encore.  For the encore presentation.  So, uh, you, you, oh, sorry.  You're divorcee guys, uh, on the phones.  Cause I want, I want to continue, uh, talking about this and, uh, take some calls because  there are a lot of good calls about, uh, people that have been through these situations  and stuff.  We hit on this every so often, but today's a special little day.  Uh, stay there.  Don't go anywhere.  And we'll be back after this, uh, very long, ponderous, disgustingly long.  No, I'm kidding. 
[01:13:30]  We have Kevin Smith and Florentine both coming in within the hour.  Yes.  So don't go anywhere.  We'll be right back.  Yeah, it's not even a sellout anymore.  Hi, Opie and Anthony show.  Opie's, uh, off.  Jim Norton in for the vacationing. 
[01:14:00]  Greg Hughes.  No, I'm teasing, of course.  Jimmy's here every day.  I certainly, but I won't be here tomorrow.  No!  As I fly to Los Angeles.  Oh.  To do a little thing called the, uh, the Jalenal program.  Program.  Yeah, tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Very good.  We'll all tune in to watch that.  I'm going to be, uh, flying back and forth a lot.  We're only missing a day here.  Yeah.  So no one should worry.  You'll be missed.  Not really.  Yeah, not really.  No, I'm teasing, of course.  Yes, you will.  But, uh, Opie's sick. 
[01:14:30]  He's got a, uh, sore throat.  So he says, but, um, I think it was something else.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well.  What do you think?  Yeah.  A little hep.  Backside maybe a little tender.  A little tender.  Maybe he was listening to what you were trying to do the other day with your girl.  Perhaps the strap on.  And decided, hey, you know, that sounds like something I might be into.  Yep.  Perhaps, uh, perhaps someone-  I somehow doubted.  Someone got a little overzealous.  Perhaps by himself.  Maybe he put the strap on and strapped it under the chair just to practice. 
[01:15:00]  And, uh-  Fucked by the chair.  Yow.  And things went awry.  Yow.  So Opie's out.  Here you go.  Kevin Smith is coming in at some point.  Florentine will be here in 20 minutes with his big balls.  Florentine's giant nuts.  They're fucking awful.  Bastard, though, man.  I love Florentine.  God.  For a guy with such huge balls, he's very funny.  The metal show he does with Eddie Trunk is actually really popular.  They do very well for VH, uh, VH1.  It's on, uh, season three starts this Saturday at 11 o'clock on VH1 Classic.  I've never seen guys that know so much about metal. 
[01:15:30]  It bugs me.  Oh, God.  They know everything.  Bringing up, like, obscure albums and shit.  Yeah.  It's like, what?  Yeah, that guy played for Winger in 1970.  Did he?  How the fuck do you know that?  Yeah.  And sometimes, who cares?  Just talk about it.  Eddie Trunk, who I really love, I think knows, as far as metal is concerned, there's nobody  in New York who's done more for metal than Trunk.  He's the go-to guy.  Whenever they need, like, a VH1 or MTV or something like that, he's doing a retrospective on metal  and stuff, they always grab Eddie.  I just wish he'd stop calling them records. 
[01:16:00]  Does he call them records?  He loves, yeah.  Eddie's old school.  Yeah, he certainly is.  But he's a knowledgeable guy.  And a creep.  And a creep.  Yeah, so Ope's out.  We're holding down the fort today.  We were talking a little bit about divorce because my last payment goes out today.  And I'm done after 10 years.  So I figured there were some people on the phone.  So we'd clear those guys and take a few calls. 
[01:16:30]  And then we'll move on to other things of the day.  Jello Jeff from Oklahoma.  What's up?  Not much.  How you doing?  Hey.  Good.  Hey, buddy.  Speak and be spoken to.  Okay.  So I've been listening to you guys for a while.  And about three and a half years ago, I got married to a fucking cunt.  And I called in with you guys, with Louis C.K.  And you guys were like, yeah, you need to get out of that shit. 
[01:17:00]  I did.  Like a month ago, I fucking packed up and left.  And thank God we didn't have any kids or anything like that.  The house was already hers.  And I said, fuck you.  I got my shit.  Got the fuck out of there.  The house was hers already?  I got the fucking house.  What?  Dude, how did she get the house?  It was already hers.  Oh, so you're the fucking freeloader then.  Dude, how long after you were married did you realize that she was kind of a cunt? 
[01:17:30]  Maybe two months.  What happened that you're like, oh, fuck, what did I do?  Kind of like what Ansel was talking about earlier.  My brother and I are real tired.  We were going to go do something one night.  And I was like, well, we're going to run down, you know, just do something stupid.  And she's like, no, no, not tonight.  You're not going to.  And I was like, oh, now I got to fucking ask permission for everything.  Like, fuck you.  The asking permission thing is something that just should not be part of fucking any marriage. 
[01:18:00]  What the hell?  Where does that come from?  Oh, oh, really?  Yes, I'm going.  I got a girlfriend, right?  I've never been married.  And she does not live with me.  She spends a lot of time at my place.  But I'll catch little moments happening like where I'll want to do something and I'll go, ah, she's going to get annoyed.  But then I'm like, that's what happens when you get fucking too into it.  So then I just do it anyway.  And I'm like, fuck her if she gets annoyed.  And we argue sometimes.  I'm like, you're not my wife. 
[01:18:30]  We're not fucking married.  And even if you are married, like the asking permission thing.  And again, I don't know what marriage with kids is like.  I can only assume it's a fucking nightmare.  Well, it all depends on how you look at it.  Oh, Uncle Paul, now.  Fringe benefits.  Sometimes your wife gets very angry.  That's things that are reported.  You can't be.  I can understand.  You can't just go, hey, I'm going to the Borgata for the weekend, you know, with some friends. 
[01:19:00]  If you have a kid, you can't then saddle the wife with the kid.  Maybe, you know, you got fucking responsibilities, shit like that.  But if you're just going out with a girl or married and it's just you two, there's no reason to go, you know what?  Hey, me and the guys are going to Atlantic City, going to do some gambling.  I'll be back Monday or I'll be back Sunday night or whatever.  Oh, oh, oh, really?  Oh, hey, you are? 
[01:19:30]  Oh, what am I supposed to do?  Oh, oh, oh.  Where does that come from?  Enough.  They just don't like to see us have fun.  No.  Their idea of fun is not what our idea of fun is.  No, it isn't.  We think different things are fun.  And the whole thing of prioritizing fun, like if you want to go out with your friends for the weekend, it doesn't mean you want to go out and have fun with your friends for the weekend.  It means you don't want to be with her for the weekend. 
[01:20:00]  And that's how she takes it.  That's a good point.  Yeah, she's actually kind of right.  Not being with her equals fun.  Because there are situations where it's like, all right, you're with your chick.  You're having a good time.  Okay?  You're having some fun.  Then you want to just hang out with the guys, fucking go to a strip club, go to, do whatever.  Do whatever guys do.  Do whatever you did when you were laughing and smiling and happy before marriage.  And the whole asking, hey, can I go out with my friends? 
[01:20:30]  When?  When will you be back?  What are you doing?  I understand the shoe on the other foot thing.  If she comes up to you and goes, my girlfriends and me, we're going to go out.  We're going to do it.  As long as there's no dick sucking and fucking going on.  By her either, though.  By her either.  That's what I mean.  Yes, of course.  I finally got your little joke rambling on.  I didn't realize I was the guy sucking a dick.  It's okay.  Oh, isolate that.  Little in front of the joke was actually accurate.  Wasn't much of a joke. 
[01:21:00]  It was more the makings of a joke.  And I prematurely fired it out.  I just know I've made so many concessions in life with girls and women through my whole fucking life.  Growing up, going through high school.  The littlest dopey girlfriend relationship in junior high up until, like, marriage.  I've always made the concessions.  I've always been the one, even though I knew I was dead fucking right on something, having to go, I'm sorry. 
[01:21:30]  I'm sorry.  And then meanwhile, there's just rage in my head going, I'm not.  Because I know I'm fucking right.  And then you get the, yeah, well, at least you realize that you.  It's like, no, I apologize.  I didn't want to.  And I'm getting the, at least I realize speech, take it as an apology and walk away because I'm going to explode.  I can never apologize under this.  Unless I'm really wrong.  I can never do it. 
[01:22:00]  I'm the worst.  Or at least I was.  I was very bad.  It's all that spaghetti on the wall.  That's all it is.  It's the spaghetti.  It's my dad throwing the spaghetti on the wall.  It's all that.  It's avoiding confrontation.  Yeah.  Because I saw enough of it, I guess, as a kid.  Like, if you want to delve into some psychobabble, I guess, whatever.  I never looked at it that way.  And I still don't look like I got to find the cause.  Like, some people are compelled to find the reason that they act a certain way instead of just fixing the fucking problem and stop doing it. 
[01:22:30]  Sometimes realizing it helps only in that, like, oh, that's what that is.  It's almost like if every time I eat something, I get a fucking stabbing pain in my stomach.  It's like the next time I get a stabbing pain in my stomach, I'm like, oh, yeah, you ate that again.  It's like I'm not going to be fucking panicky, like, what the fuck is wrong with my stomach?  Sometimes it just helps to identify it.  But I love spaghetti.  I didn't mean spaghetti.  Oh, I thought you were literal.  Gallons a cum.  You're being literal Jim and saying I ate some and had a bellyache.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Yeah, so it's just my whole life, though, done that, made those concessions and asked permission to go out and been denied and, like, gone out. 
[01:23:00]  And then felt like, oh, my God, the whole time I was out, I just knew I was in trouble.  Like, and I'd have to make up an excuse as to where I was and what I was doing instead of just saying, me and fucking Joe Curry were hanging out at the off-Broadway pub drinking beer.  But don't you, you notice when you're making an excuse, you start, like, say you saw a female friend and you want to, you know you're going to hear shit. 
[01:23:30]  So you want to say, yeah, I saw Diane.  But you have to go, I saw Diane.  Like, yeah, I know her from a long time ago.  I was friends with her husband.  Yeah.  You have to start.  Insta excuse comes out, right.  Immediately constructing the relationship or whatever it is just so you don't have to hear shit.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  I don't get it.  This is where Bob Kelly would talk to me.  Like, you know what, Dan?  All you got to do is go, boom, fuck you.  He's like the worst advice.  He's like, shut up, Bob.  You don't do that.  My favorite thing is the assumptions, like where you'll be with your chick and then she'll throw little keywords or clues at you and then you have to now piece together what she actually means. 
[01:24:00]  Ah, yeah, that's so much fun.  That's probably my least favorite, you know, part or component of the relationship.  God forbid you don't get it, right?  Yeah, well, exactly.  Because, you know, let's say you're talking to your chick and she's like, oh, yeah, I'll be home probably about eight.  That doesn't mean I'm just letting you know what time I'm going to be home.  That means I'm going to be home at eight.  You should be, too.  And if you're not, I'm going to be really pissed off.  But I'm not going to tell you straight up.  I'm just going to let you see if you can decide what I'm thinking. 
[01:24:30]  And then when you're in trouble, it'll be I told you I was going to be home at eight.  And you're like, yeah, but you didn't say I couldn't go out.  Because that's exactly how it goes.  Because then the fight starts.  And then it's exactly verbatim what you just said.  It's, well, I told you I was going to be home at eight.  That wasn't don't go out.  Can't you just say I'm home.  I know you're out and doing stuff, but I'd appreciate it if, you know, if you come home and we could do something together.  That's fine.  I don't have a problem with that.  Yeah, that sounds too nice and civil. 
[01:25:00]  Don't just throw out little puzzle pieces and expect me to put them all together.  Just say what you mean.  What's worse than the fucking bad prying question when they do this shit?  Because women are not good psychologically.  They're fucking dumbbells.  We do see right through that, by the way, girl.  They're terrible.  Like, I heard, I had my phone today.  I'm listening to some messages.  My mother had left me a message.  So she hears a female voice from across the room.  She goes, oh, is that me?  Like, did I leave that message?  And I'm like, no.  I know why you're asking.  Dead silence. 
[01:25:30]  I hang up the phone because I heard the message.  A minute later.  Well, who was that?  And I wanted to go, why?  And it would have just been a big fight.  But I wanted to fight because I knew it was my mother.  But I won't have to say my mother.  But it's like, why don't you just ask me right out?  Don't fucking, don't try to be slick.  So it was, it was, yeah.  There's another girl's voice on there.  I'm a little suspect of what that is.  But instead of, you know, showing the true colors there, it's always, hey, yeah.  Who is that?  Oh, who's that?  It's like they hear a selective part. 
[01:26:00]  Like, they hear the word cock sucking coming out of the phone.  And it was just mom still.  Absolutely.  Of course.  Asking dad if he'd like, like a good one.  Let's see what we got here.  When you're married.  Let's go to Ed.  Ed.  Hi, Ed from Connecticut.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Don't you think it's easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission, though?  That old forgiveness than permission.  Nah, you got to have a, you got to have like a special mindset also in order to do that. 
[01:26:30]  Because you're still feeling like a fucking piece of shit when you're out having fun.  Right.  You still feel like now you got to answer for something.  So the asking for forgiveness is the apology that you don't want to make.  So no.  I'd rather be able to just say, no, this is what I'm doing.  And like I said, my entire life never did that.  Avoided confrontation to the point where I was just miserable. 
[01:27:00]  For so many years of my life were spent like just not being happy in a situation where I should have been happy in.  Not walking around crying and depressed the whole time.  I had my share of fun.  That's for sure.  But when it came to relationships and certain aspects of them, it was like I should be able to go and have a good time without having to answer to somebody.  Especially before I was married shit.  That's girlfriend stuff.  That's true fuck you stuff.  Yeah.  But I couldn't. 
[01:27:30]  I just would fucking get all wormy and fucking apologetic.  Yuck.  I sucked.  Yeah, but so what?  You learned.  At least you're not fucking 65 and married and miserable.  You're fucking, you know, you're 63.  I was just going to say two years away from it.  Of course, you fucker.  I saw that one coming.  But it's like now you learned.  A lot of guys don't learn, man.  You're lucky even have fucking kids.  Yeah.  Oh, believe me.  And you've taught me too.  Yeah.  Don't.  No.  Don't.  Won't.  Yuck.  Hi there, Sarah.  Sarah from Ohio. 
[01:28:00]  How are you?  I'm fine.  Good evening, gentlemen.  Hi, Sarah.  You're liking our misogynistic talk of the day?  Yes.  Misogynistic Thursdays.  It doesn't vary much from day to day, so I'm okay with that.  Yeah.  You guys are dating the wrong ladies.  Is that it?  There's really no other excuse for it.  Don't you think there'd be a track record, though, where occasionally you'd pick a winner?  Yeah.  Where it wouldn't be like that?  Dude, it's not a poster.  You should know.  You should know better than anybody that odds don't always play in your favor. 
[01:28:30]  It's the river card.  You can't bet on the river card.  Oh, I always get a suck out.  Somebody sucks out, I get fucked.  No, sorry.  Now, what, uh, so dating the wrong kind of lady.  Now, what about you?  Are you in a relationship?  Are you married?  I am.  Well, uh, I mean, I'm not legally married, but I've been in a relationship for seven years.  All right.  Now, what about, uh, your, your, uh, your guy friend?  Um, does he, does he ask, what, a lady, what?  Yeah, she's a lady friend.  Oh, you're, are you kidding? 
[01:29:00]  No, I would have been.  Uh, I just was, was that.  That's true.  Lesbians never joke.  You're a lesbian.  I don't make bad jokes.  Okay.  Well, you know something?  You're a hell of a judge on what type of ladies, uh, we should be going out with.  That's my point.  That's my point.  You're dating the wrong ladies.  He's being sarcastic.  He doesn't think you're a particularly good judge.  Yeah, I don't think you're a good judge of, of men and women cohabitating and, and dating  and, and, and making compromises and doing things like that because you, you both have  vaginas.  Well, there, there is the sexual thing and there's the psychological thing that you're totally 
[01:29:30]  missing.  Yeah.  Um, women are fucking crazy.  No, no.  Uh, you know something?  I, I have said that, um, for many years now, I've just convinced, I've been convinced  that women are kind of nutty.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  They're, and I think they, they're all like that.  And then they'll say, you know, guys are all crazy too.  They'll all, I guess, it's just a matter, it's a matter of, it's not even a matter of, 
[01:30:00]  uh, can you, you know what you want and women never ever know what they want.  Even if they tell you that's what they want.  Hmm.  True.  It's not a matter of getting along with somebody as much as it is a matter of, uh, having conflicting  baggage.  I think like when you're in a relationship, it's not even like, wow, we're made for each  other.  This is great.  We have so many common interests.  It's how much shit that you, it's the least shit you don't have in common is more important  than the shit you have in common.  The less you can fight about, the better. 
[01:30:30]  And then just sitting on the couch watching TV is a good time.  You know, you don't have to fucking be out spinning plates on sticks for these girls  as long as you're not sitting there alone, just fucking looking at each other with disdain.  Then there are these awkward moments in a relationship, though, like when you're watching TV and  she likes to lay with you and put her head on you because she's close, but you want  to go, I hate being touched when I watch TV, but you can't say that without starting a  fight.  You just sit there brooding.  That is a tough one, though.  It's like, uh, yeah, I just don't want to be touched right now, but that's not, not  by.  There's guys who like that, though. 
[01:31:00]  Dudes like that.  Yeah, I'm not saying.  Isn't Opie like that?  Isn't he gay like that?  Gay like that?  I don't know.  I've never laid around on the couch with him.  When his head's on your lap.  Yeah, we fucking head our own ways.  How about you just don't rub your feet on me for three and a half straight hours while I'm  trying to do things?  Oh, how fucking awful is that?  How about that?  Oh, shit.  Wear on you, though.  On your fucking, on your legs?  Yeah.  Like a cat doing your mouth?  Exactly.  Doing biscuits.  Exactly.  Happy feet.  That's what we would call it.  Thanks a lot, Sarah.  Take it easy.  Thank you, Laura.  Bye.  You're a lesbian. 
[01:31:30]  Yes.  Love Sarah.  Lesbian.  We all love lesbians.  It's fantastic.  Yeah, the touching thing is weird because, um, that's a, that's a weird situation.  If you're hanging out just watching a movie, uh, usually there's an assumption there  that you can just kind of hang out and lay your head down, head on shoulder, hand on  fucking lap, whatever, you know, arm around, things like that.  And then if you, if you, if you say something, there's really no excuse for it.  If you say, I don't feel like being touched, that means I don't like you touching me. 
[01:32:00]  But that's not, you're right.  Yeah.  And that's not the, so what you do is you get up and go to the bathroom and you sit down  on the couch, you position yourself a little different, hoping they get a hint.  Women are the worst fucking hint takers.  She's going and going.  She gets you a Flomax prescription.  There's nothing but get up and piss.  Yeah.  Every time I touch him, it's like, why don't you stop fucking octopus hands?  I'm here.  Do you not see me?  You don't like that?  Sometimes I don't mind.  I like affection, but other times it's like, stop touching me. 
[01:32:30]  You don't like being touched by, like, I love it at times.  Like at times, it just, you know what it is?  It doesn't happen so much that it bugs me.  Right.  Like if I was, you know, um, what, leaving for work in the morning and as I'm getting  into the truck, I'm being touched right up until I pull out of the driveway.  Like there could be a problem with the, you know, uh, attachment there, but, uh, I don't  mind sitting on the couch, having your leg rub, things like that, my hand job.  Me neither.  Please just jerk it. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  If you're going to touch something here, I'll give you this.  But then like after a while, sometimes it gets to be hot and it's just warm with the  body heat and you're like, what are you doing?  Okay.  Well, that's an uncomfortable issue.  That's not like a, you're touching me issue.  That's like, you wouldn't want a blanket on you or a cat.  Oh, okay.  We're a fucking human.  It's like, will you look at the TV?  That's what I do when TV's on.  Look at the TV.  Stop looking at me and thinking what I'm thinking.  Exactly.  Stop with the fucking loving looks.  Look at the tube. 
[01:33:30]  I'm next to you.  God damn.  How much togetherness do you need?  Why do you, why does as a guide, you have to convince the girl that you're with that  you're there?  Like, just, just deal, like we're together.  I'm not going anywhere.  Why do I have to keep convincing you that I'm not going anywhere?  It's like we both exist.  We're here.  Stop it.  Exactly.  We're here.  We're here watching.  Let's go to Canada.  Ooh.  Ryan from Ontario.  Morning, guys.  How you doing?  Hi. 
[01:34:00]  Hi, Ryan.  Yeah, I got this chum of mine.  Just got married a couple years ago, and he's married to the biggest fucking cunt I've  seen in a long time.  How long do you know this chum?  Did you grow up with him?  Oh, yeah.  We grew up together.  This guy was kind of a bit of a goofy playboy.  Sure, sure.  He went through a lot of different chicks and just had a good time.  Is he your best chum, or is he like just a regular chum?  Yeah, we're like best chums.  But does she hate, though, that you're so chummy with him? 
[01:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  She hates anybody that has to do anything with him because that means that he's going  to be pulled away from her.  Sure.  Is it something like you've known him for years, or is he a recent chum?  What's that?  Have you known this chum for years, or is he a recent chum of yours?  No, we've known each other since mid-90s.  Oh, so how old of a chum is he?  He's what, 29?  All right, so you've been chummy for at least 10 years.  Yeah.  Well, what do you do when you chum around? 
[01:35:00]  Do you go to strip clubs, or do you guys just kind of chum around to the mall?  Fuck, we don't chum around much at all anymore because, again, the guy's not allowed to go  out anywhere.  Oh, because of the wife?  Oh, Jesus.  She cut his balls off and glued them to herself.  Does she know you guys are like best chums?  Well, I guess you could say we were best chums then.  Yes, we could.  When you two express chumminess, it really bothers her. 
[01:35:30]  Dude, that is the dumbest word for a friend I've ever heard in my life.  I would only want to hear that your friend's a chum if you're explaining why he was eating  with a shark or by one.  Chopped up being lobbed off a boat by a certain policeman.  I'll say pal then, okay?  How about just friend?  It's too late.  Yeah, don't say pal.  I don't even care about your point anymore, chum.  Exactly.  Take a hike.  Be good, friend.  Chum.  I love it. 
[01:36:00]  You chum.  We must have said chum 1,478 times.  What an ass.  Oh, chum.  Hey, Jeff, my chum from Connecticut.  What's up?  How are you, friend?  Good.  Hey, congratulations, Anthony.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, my brother is going through a divorce right now.  Same exact thing that you did, Anthony.  Yeah.  Same scenario.  Mother-in-law buttoned in the whole thing.  They kicked him out of the house. 
[01:36:30]  The mother-in-law lives a block away.  Kicked him out of the house.  He still pays every fucking bill in this house.  Everything.  She has a business in the house as a beautician, you know, beauty parlor.  And he's getting fucked.  She wants lifetime alimony.  Lifetime, huh?  They have kids?  Lifetime.  No kids.  How old?  I got two kids.  I paid my ex-wife over $600 a week.  She wants close to that for a lifetime.  Wait.  How old is the woman?  The woman, she's 40. 
[01:37:00]  Ugh.  God, what a fucking disaster.  Fucking nightmare.  Fucking nightmare.  Oh.  And he's going to pay her, before this is all said and done, he has to pay her $2,000 so  she can go out and look for an apartment in the meantime before the divorce.  Yeah, that's good, because, you know, they're helpless.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Well, thank you.  We've been through this a thousand times.  Thanks, man.  Be good, guys.  Thanks.  It's ponderous.  But, yeah, I'm done.  Great.  What else is going on today?  I guess...  Roman Polanski. 
[01:37:30]  Roman Polanski.  Yep.  Clear the field!  Clear the phones!  Thank you.  Roman Polanski decided he was going to go to some fucking thing where he was being honored.  Yeah.  And whoopsie.  Well, let me tell you something.  Greg Gottfeld made such a good point.  His Gregologs are really good, man.  On Red Eye last night, we talked about this.  Greg's logs.  Yeah, Greg's logs.  But it's amazing how they're defending him in Hollywood. 
[01:38:00]  And Greg had a great term for it.  He called selective feminism.  It's amazing how he really did...  It's not like Roman Polanski fucked a 16-year-old and didn't know it.  And he's being...  You know, all right.  Then that happens.  He knew she was young.  And he fucking gave her champagne and a Quaalude.  And he fucked her in the ass.  Yeah, champagne cocktail!  Fucked her in the ass?  Yes, he sodomized her.  Oh!  Unless they're calling it sodomy because she sucked his dick.  But I believe he fucked her in the ass in a hot tub.  You know what, dude?  You know, she knew.  Like, Bob would always take...  Bob is such a woman hater. 
[01:38:30]  He would always take up for the fucking guy.  You know what, dude?  She knew.  Fuck her!  She wants to be in the movies!  Oh, he fucked her in the ass in a hot tub?  I believe he did.  I don't know how he did that.  Didn't he more beef stew when he's done?  Oh, I hate to have to clean the filter.  Oh, we gotta backwatch this.  I know.  There's shit and tears in the filter.  I believe he was.  If he fucked her in the vaginally, and I'm wrong, whatever.  I believe he was in the ass.  And it's amazing now, like, all these people in Hollywood are coming out going, let it go.  It's a long time.  It's amazing how, with one of their own, not one of these fucking celebrities, I know 
[01:39:00]  it's a different set of punishment, but not one of these guys came out for fucking  Imus, or came out for somebody who said something racist, or politically incorrect, or did something.  Yeah, yeah.  They are all fucking...  Oh, we have audio of Sharon Tate's sister, who is Roman Polanski's obvious wife, who was  slaughtered by Manson.  Yeah.  But these people are coming out for him, and drove.  Whoopi Goldberg is coming out?  And saying, that's fine, let it go.  So, yeah, there's this, that whole elitist Hollywood community where, I don't know, and 
[01:39:30]  enough time is...  Like, I really don't give a flying fuck if he comes back here and gets, like, no time.  It doesn't matter.  And I know the jokes will start, well, Anthony's just hoping it doesn't happen to him.  But it's just, I think so much time going by kind of lightens it up a little bit.  But the fact that she came out, the victim came out and said that, you know, she doesn't 
[01:40:00]  care.  That the press did it.  I mean, he did commit a crime.  It's...  It's...  And he did flee sentencing.  But, I mean, you're just like, so much time went by.  Who cares at this point?  Who knows what their deal was?  Who knows?  I don't care what she says.  Look, I think Roman Polanski did kind of get fucked in a way where he had done, like,  45 days in jail and he had a plea bargain where he was going to just get sentenced to  time served.  Oh, yeah, yep, yep, yep.  And then they reneged on it.  So it's like, I'm not even saying I blame him for leaving. 
[01:40:30]  But, you know, the judge got mad because he saw him on bail partying at Oktoberfest and  maybe not showing any remorse.  Yeah, they made a deal and he was supposed to, like, do, like, no time.  And, ooh, they reneged on that one.  Came back and said, well, we're going to give you, like, 20 years or something.  If the facts are, as I think they are, I, like, I don't have any mercy for them.  If you drug and fuck a 13-year-old, fuck you, man.  It's like you ask for whatever you get.  Yeah.  It's not, again, 16 years old, that can happen. 
[01:41:00]  But if you take a girl there on the purpose of doing a photo shoot and she really doesn't  want to fuck, but she does, um, fuck that, man.  13 is way too young to be sticking with dick in.  Well, yeah.  Well, at least it was champagne and quaaludes.  Yeah, well, it was a different time, Jimmy.  I wonder how they'd be reacting, though, if it was Dakota Fanning.  Right, right, right.  And he wasn't a director.  Let's just say he was a local photographer.  Now, I don't know if Dakota Fanning's 13.  How old is she?  Do we know?  16.  Oh, is she that old?  Okay. 
[01:41:30]  Think.  Let's just say when Dakota was 13.  Waiting, wait.  She was 15.  But she's older than 13.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's say some local guy had stuck his dick in Dakota Fanning when she was underage and  given her a quaalude and gotten her fucking buzzed.  Crucified.  She's 15.  Say two years ago.  Would they still be rushing and going, come on.  Yeah.  Give him a break.  Let him go.  Fuck that.  Yeah, I guess because of, you know, obviously who he is, the celebrity thing.  It's all it is. 
[01:42:00]  The fact that it happened so many years ago that he's still been putting out his product  over the years.  You know, he's won an Oscar.  Yep.  During the time he's been in France.  Boy, those French, huh?  They'll take him in and not give him back.  And they don't give a shit.  We don't have extradition with France?  No.  At all.  Not for that.  And Florentine just walked in and he certainly understands this.  He says he's been on the business end of being fucked by an older man and a fucking  a younger woman.  We talk about Roman Polanski.  And how fucking in Hollywood they're just rushing to his defense. 
[01:42:30]  But they would not be rushing to his defense if he was just some scummy nobody who fucking  who got Dakota Fanning drunk and gave her a quaalude and fucked her in the ass in a  hot tub.  They'd be calling for him to be thrown in prison for 20 years.  Could you keep just repeating that scenario?  Scummy nobody.  Radio host with goatee.  If he directed Son-in-Law by Pauly Shore, no one would be defending him.  Exactly.  He'd have to be Chinatown in the penis.  Yeah.  Maybe Pauly Shore would be.  I want to do a sequel.  That's a good point. 
[01:43:00]  If he was not a fucking, if he was directing horrible fucking movies.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, if he was some shitty, half-ass director.  Exactly.  Celebrities are stupid.  It's like Whoopi Goldberg coming out.  And she's always one of these liberal fucking for the cause, the rights of the victims and  things like that.  And meanwhile, you know, bring him back.  It's water under the bridge.  What is she saying?  Didn't she say something like it wasn't rape or something?  She said it's not rape.  It wasn't rape, rape.  Oh, what?  Did you just put the helmet in?  Which, yeah.  Which I was like, we were talking about that when Patrice was in the other day. 
[01:43:30]  Rape, rapety, rape, rape.  It's like different levels of rape.  We were actually talking about this before they even got Roman Polanski.  But Patrice was talking about the different levels of rape.  Like there's date rape and then there's statutory rape.  And then there's like you're fooling around with the girl and then she, in the middle of  it says no rape.  And then there's just out bash a girl over the head you don't know and rape.  And it was like, well, you were charged with rape, rapety, rape, rape, which is like the  worst kind.  And for Whoopi to say it wasn't rape, rape, do we have that clip? 
[01:44:00]  Let's hear Whoopi actually say this.  It was not charged.  I know it wasn't rape, rape.  Yeah, I thought it was unstatutory.  Child molest, maybe?  I'm not sure.  It was something else, but I don't believe it was rape, rape.  And when we get all the information, somebody will tell me in my ear.  All I'm trying to get you to understand is when we're talking about what someone did and  what they were charged with, we have to say what it actually was, not what we think it  was.  If we go back with what he said he did, he gave her quaaludes, he gave her champagne, she was 
[01:44:30]  drugged, she was 13 years old.  He answered, here's a transcript.  Sounds like a party.  That's what I'm saying, you're 13 years old.  She was still a child.  He answered.  Initially, excuse me, initially he was charged with rape, go ahead.  And then he pled guilty to having sex with a minor, okay?  And he went to jail, and when they let him out.  45 days.  And when they let him out, he said, you know what?  This guy's going to give me 100 years in jail, I'm not staying.  And that's why he left. 
[01:45:00]  So that's why I wanted to be really clear, because I wanted to know exactly what we were talking  about.  And I'm going, does that make it okay to, you know, instead of staying in fighting,  to say, you know, he's going to give me 100 years, I'm out of here.  I don't know.  Now they're just talking about the fleeing stuff.  Fuck that.  I don't want to listen to these four fucking babbling bitches.  But for her to say, you know, not rape-rape, that's kind of odd.  That's like, you know, yeah, what if it was another situation that they were doing a story  about something with no celebrities involved? 
[01:45:30]  Just some guy, a 13-year-old girl, quaaludes, champagne, fucking.  He flees.  Do you think Whoopi's going to be going, you know, it wasn't rape-rape.  She'd be fucking crucified.  Say it was the Olsen twins when they were fucking, like, when they were 13.  Oh, yeah, let's say that.  And it was, like, some beloved young celebrity.  Yeah.  And someone did that to one of the Olsen, people would be out of their minds.  Well, then you could use, it wasn't rape-rape.  Because there's two of them.  That's true.  Who's rape-squared? 
[01:46:00]  We have, there's, so what does Sharon Tate's sister say?  She only drinks Sanka.  Oh, shit.  Get that can out of here.  So, wait, what's that, Sam, who's that girl under there?  Sam has a CNN graphic up.  Who the fuck is that beautiful woman?  Well, this video is CNN at one of the red carpet things asking a handful of celebrities what they thought of Rowan Polanski.  So, if you want to listen to that, or, I don't know, maybe. 
[01:46:30]  She's lovely.  So, they're small celebrities, you're saying?  Yeah.  It's a handful.  That's very tiny celebrities.  No, no, no, like a few.  And a very tiny joke.  Oh, is that what that was?  Actually, one that you can't see without a microscope.  I thought that was a dramatic statement.  Yuck.  That was a good one.  No, it was terrible.  I know it's like, we need to hear something.  Well, wait, this?  Attaboy.  Yuck.  I think it's up to the girl, frankly.  I think that if she, you know, if she's okay with it, and she feels that they're resolved, then who are we to say? 
[01:47:00]  But if the victim has issues...  Hold on, who are we?  Fucking society with laws, you dopey fucking trainer bitch.  Shut up.  It's not always the victim that gets to say whether, you know, you're able to arrest and charge somebody with something.  Because they might have had a settlement that we don't know about.  So, basically, if you have money and you can pay the victim, you can do it.  Shut up, lady.  It's up to her.  Rape, rapety, rape. 
[01:47:30]  So, if she said it's not okay, I want him in jail, then she'd be saying, okay.  Then she'd be gone.  Yeah, put Polanski in jail.  And I feel she should have retribution.  If somebody drugged and raped my 13-year-old, I'd shoot him.  So, I'm just saying.  I have very mixed personal feelings about it.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it seems as though...  A 13-year-old girl is a 13-year-old girl.  Oh, shit.  Hold on.  Pause that.  Very mixed personal feelings about it. 
[01:48:00]  What happened to young Lisa Kudrow?  You can only imagine.  And we can only imagine because anything else would be liable.  It's almost like...  I think that hesitation is coming from the fact that a lot of these people don't want to come out and blast Roman Polanski.  Because all the other celebrities and powerful guys like Woody Allen and Harvey Weinstein are backing him.  But I don't give a fuck.  You know what?  Fuck the 13-year-old.  Fuck him.  These fucking worms that sit here and won't commit one way or another just because there might be the potential that they might put him in a movie or give him a job. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Believe me.  If Kevin Smith fucked a 13-year-old, I'd back him 100%.  I'd get rid of the evidence.  I'd fucking wash out the hot tub.  I'd clean his dick off.  You'd be as Robert Kardashian.  Get rid of their clothes.  I'd throw his underwear out and his fucking trench coat.  Anything with cum on it, I'd get rid of.  And Lisa Kudrow's fucking head.  Holy shit, what a big oval head she has.  Yeah, her head grew since Friends. 
[01:49:00]  Or Chums, as they call it up in Canada.  Love that show, Chums.  To me, Hollywood has really jumped on the bandwagon in support of Roman Polanski.  What makes me worried is what does that mean for other 12 or 13-year-old girls who are being drugged or seduced or, you know.  Where is this happening?  Exactly, Long Island.  I'm not saying that's going to happen, but I just, you know, I don't know what we're saying. 
[01:49:30]  It's such a complicated situation, obviously.  Patricia Arquette?  There was a real lapse of judgment there in a very serious way.  Oh.  It's only complicated by the fact that the girl herself said, you know, that she thinks he should be free.  Pause again.  First of all, she looks like David Spade now.  And that's fucking creeping me out.  What happened to Patricia Arquette?  I don't know.  True romance and shit.  I know.  I was going to say, she was.  She's doing the fucking Tanner Boyle story. 
[01:50:00]  Holy shit.  The fuck is with that?  It's not a lapse in judgment.  He fucked a 13.  It's like, it's amazing the soft language they use to excuse a guy who is admittedly a brilliant director.  Yeah.  It's amazing the fucking language these stupid assholes use.  Yeah, they are really weaving around this, walking on eggshells.  Can I find another fucking stupid way to put this?  They're really, they really are, though, giving them kid gloves.  That's one.  Kid gloves. 
[01:50:30]  Kid gloves.  Yeah.  Why can't they just come out and say, hey, I don't think he did anything wrong.  Let him come back.  Or fuck the guy.  Put him in prison.  What cowards.  They're also afraid of saying the wrong thing.  It's kind of a lapse in judgment.  Lapse in judgment.  That's not a lapse in judgment.  When you're drugging champagne.  You know what you're fucking doing.  Even if it was consensual.  Even if she said, no, I want to.  I'm in love with this guy.  It's still not right.  Yeah.  She had a lapse in judgment when she fucking told her barber. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, I know.  Do that to my fucking hairdo.  I want to look.  Barber and hairdo?  Where the fuck?  What time machine did you just say?  Do you think Patricia Arquette goes to the little barber in a corner with his bald little pole?  The same one that does the fucking Hardy Boys.  And gets a hairdo.  That fucking hairdo stinks.  Maybe she gets a shave, too.  That's great.  They comb her hair with that blue fluid and just send it out the door.  Yeah, beat it, lady man.  All right.  Let's see what other brilliant points she makes. 
[01:51:30]  Such a complicated thing to even talk about here.  And who cares what I think about that?  He's probably one of the greatest child molesting directors of all time.  Good for Tom.  That's something we can all agree on.  I agree with that.  Good, Tom.  Excellent, Tom.  Maybe he wasn't being ironic, though.  Maybe he just really meant that.  He wasn't being sarcastic, I mean.  I'm sorry.  Maybe he really meant he's one of the best child.  He actually is one of the best child molesting directors.  Do you know any other ones?  We don't know. 
[01:52:00]  We don't know other ones.  Did Fatty Arbuckle ever direct?  Did he molest a child?  I don't know.  He did something with a Coke bottle.  Oh, yeah, of course.  He might be the thirstiest fucking fat comedian ever.  Can you pink sock a girl in black and white, though?  I'm sure you can.  That was years ago.  It's a gray sock.  He gray socked her.  Mary Pickford gets gray socked her.  America's sweetheart walking around with some gray matter hanging out of a bunghole.  Walking on the red carpet. 
[01:52:30]  We have audio of Sharon Tate's sister of the Today Show.  Let's hear what she has to say.  Sharon Tate was fucking smoking.  Roman is a brilliant director.  There is no disputing that.  He's also a philanthropist.  He helps many people get a foothold in the business.  He's quite a humanitarian.  He's a good guy.  And yet there is this other side, and that is the polarizing part of this story,  that he committed a crime some 30 years ago and then fled this country to avoid punishment 
[01:53:00]  for that crime.  And so, you know, how do you respond to people who say it doesn't matter that he's brilliant  and a great director.  He deserves to serve time for that crime.  There was a deal made back in the 70s where Roman would undergo evaluation and spend four months  in jail.  He did that.  He was evaluated not to be a pedophile. 
[01:53:30]  And there's, as I said, rape and then there's rape.  I love how people are using semantics in this case.  Man.  There's rape and then there's rape.  No, there's statutory rape and there's rape.  Whether it was consensual or not, he had statutory rape with this girl.  And I probably think he probably shouldn't go to jail because he probably did.  Look, they gave him a deal, whatever we think about it.  They signed off on a deal. 
[01:54:00]  Fair enough.  But, you know, you can't fucking renege on that.  But it wasn't a crime of anger.  Like, rape's a crime of anger where you fucking punch a chick in the face.  It was a sex thing.  He wanted to fuck her and he fucked her.  God, I mean, Sharon Tate's sister's kind of glossing over his personality there.  I mean, she lived with him through the whole Manson thing.  Oh, yeah?  I guess they're best of pals.  Yeah.  I mean, he probably takes care of her.  Yeah.  Philanthropist.  Oh, philanthropist.  Yeah.  These women sound just like when Clinton was cheating on his wife.  Yeah.  You know, Hillary.  And they're like, oh, look, he's doing whatever he does in his personal life. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, really?  But meanwhile, the guy who pumps gas down the street is an asshole for fucking, you know,  the neighbor.  He's the biggest dick.  I can't believe that.  You know, but Clinton, he's just taking, you know, you know, he's just taking advantage  of a 21-year-old intern.  Hey, whatever he does in his private life, it's fine.  Absolutely right.  That was a guy, you know, a place of power.  I mean, obviously, the place of power.  Very impressionable 21-year-old fatty.  And he drags her in there and gets her head off of her.  Put his dick between two hoagie buns and the rest is history. 
[01:55:00]  You know, and again, the Hollywood elite, the left, all just came out and defended him  like, hey, it's his private life.  That's something him and Hillary have to deal with.  It has nothing to do with his being the president.  And it has, and then everybody said it has to do with judgment, with like being able  to make a judgment call.  That isn't good judgment.  Yeah, the guy's taking cigars in her snatch.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  While Arafat's waiting for him like outside, you know, a little odd. 
[01:55:30]  While Arafat waits.  Yeah, yeah.  While Arafat was waiting, he was getting the head off of Lewinsky.  I kind of like that, actually.  That is really good.  Arafat was a pig.  Fuck him.  Let him wait.  I'm getting my dick sucked.  Dirty asshole lips.  Arafat's lips were enragingly ugly.  Oh, God.  Juicy.  Fat pussy face.  God damn.  Let's see.  Oh, apparently Sean from Georgia is going to tell us what the genius Ron Bennington from  the Ron and Fez show, following our show, said about this. 
[01:56:00]  Sean, what did Ronnie say?  Ronnie didn't say, but you said that.  Be my little baby.  Get it?  No, go ahead.  God, man.  I actually did not get it.  I am a B-17 today.  Wow.  A B-13.  Get it?  Oh, I get it now.  Sean?  Sorry.  Yes?  Hard for the shenanigans.  All right.  What Ronnie said yesterday was about the people saying that she wants them, that there will 
[01:56:30]  not be any charges anymore.  Was that should you be allowed to rape a nun or an Amish person who only knows forgiveness?  There you go.  And that's all they're going to ask for?  Ah, interesting.  The answer is obviously yes.  Yeah, of course you can.  All right.  So Ron makes his point.  I completely agree.  I was just saying that's what Ron said.  Everybody knows Ron's a nun raper, though.  That's really a fucking biased opinion.  He's just trying to get out of charges that are still pending.  He can't see a cross and a black thing over a woman's head without getting a fucking  erection.  I was just going to say without his dick getting hard, but I tripped.  If you're going to rape a nun, is it going to be that good? 
[01:57:00]  I mean, she's not going to be into it.  It's going to be terrible.  You know, she's not going to tell me to flip me over on all fours.  I can't I can't even keep my rod when a girl wants me to fuck her.  What is that fucking scene in Bad Lieutenant?  That one with the nun?  Was that the one?  Oh, yeah.  Bad Lieutenant where the two guys rapes a nun.  And yeah.  Oh, what a scene that was.  And she just kind of rolls her head over.  She looked she was pretty hot with the habit ripped off of her.  And she just leans her head over and she's looking at like Jesus and stuff. 
[01:57:30]  And and they're just banging her.  Oh, really kind of disturbing.  Until you said disturbing.  I couldn't tell how you felt about it.  Oh, no, no.  I saw him getting excited.  Well, because it's a movie.  Like, I could watch some horrific things in a movie and and be like, why is this turning  me on?  This is really terrible.  And then real life shit.  You know, I can't deal with that.  Like going to some of the websites and seeing massive degradation on women, whether they're 
[01:58:00]  just being shit on.  You can tell they don't want to be.  And opianathene.com.  Yes, exactly.  That doesn't exist.  Yeah, that's right.  Does not exist.  But wasn't that your favorite part in that film when he gets a blowjob from the girl when  he pulls her over?  She didn't blow, but he just jerked off on the door.  I love that.  I remember you always tell me that's your favorite part.  Show me how you suck a cock.  I would love to do that.  He made her imaginary blow him like she was blowing the invisible man and he was jerking  off outside the car. 
[01:58:30]  Came on her door.  The one girl showed her ass and the one girl pretended she was sucking the cock.  She told me to ask, turn around, turn around.  I took the police test after I saw that.  Thanks.  I thought they got a total zero.  Where is that one?  Oh, I love it.  Yeah, we actually have the clip of him when he's doing that.  One of my faves.  A couple of very beautiful girls, you know that?  He walks up to him with a couple of very beautiful girls.  Where were you tonight?  The Kit Kat Club?  Kit Kat Club.  Do you ever suck a guy's cock?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock. 
[01:59:00]  The last time I'm going to ask you, show me with your mouth.  Show me with your mouth.  And then he got a little upset with himself.  Oh, sorry!  I did so many bad things!  It's fantastic.  Show me with your mouth.  That wasn't rape-rape, though.  Should we...  Rape-rape.  Because Kevin's coming in.  We have to break at one point.  Just Kevin Smith's coming in, so we're all going to...  Yeah, we're like doing hours. 
[01:59:30]  We're doing hour blocks.  Let me just plug Jim's stuff, too.  Yes!  Because he'll be here.  Season 3 of That Metal Show, it starts this Saturday, October 3rd at 11 on VH1 Classic.  It's a fucking great show, man.  And what's your website?  JimFlorentine.com.  And you can see Jim's got gigs in Cleveland coming up.  Atlanta.  Tonight through Sunday.  Through Sunday in Cleveland.  Oh, you're going with tonight?  Yeah, tonight.  Okay, Jesus, I didn't realize it.  Okay, tonight through Sunday in Cleveland.  Yes.  And if not, Atlanta and Stress Factory both coming up in the coming weeks here on Jim's 
[02:00:00]  website.  That was the worst plug ever.  Here on Jim's website.  I pointed the table.  Right here on this piece of paper.  JimFlorentine.com.  And tonight through fucking Sunday in Cleveland.  Jimmy gets his plugs perfect.  No, I don't.  I like how he slides them in.  No, you don't.  Dude, my plugs are fucking...  It's not a bad...  We've got to do one a break.  Jim's got his now.  Fuck, me and Boston in the...  At the end of November.  Who gives a shit?  Irrelevant.  Yeah, take it.  Oh, yeah, me and Jim are doing December 12th Kansas City together.  Kansas City? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Have you ever played down there?  I have, yeah.  How was it?  It was good, actually.  Yeah, yeah.  The hottest chicks probably in the country.  Really?  Yeah, Kansas City.  Get the fuck out of here, really?  Kansas, yeah, like this whole...  Those corn-fed fucking want to leave and become prostitutes.  Blonde hair, blue eyes, corn-fed.  Do they fuck?  They fuck, and they don't even realize what losers they're with.  Not that they're all losers there, but there could be a guy that just, like, you know,  works on his truck.  He shoots tobacco.  He brings a friggin' dip to a wedding.  Yeah.  Oh, my cup.  With a 10.  And I'm like, do you realize if you moved to L.A., you'd have a mansion in a week. 
[02:01:00]  You'd be living in a mansion in a week.  You don't have to take that.  Or Long Island.  Nice.  I could offer you a one-bedroom in Manhattan if you get a big pussy.  Super hot chicks in Kansas City.  We're doing that in December.  I'm actually really psyched about that.  These two gentlemen.  We'll take a quick break and be back right after these words.  With Kevin.  Ah.  Wow.  But it never gets to the vocals, right? 
[02:01:30]  We should stop playing.  We should only play Rejoiners whole songs.  No, and then just fade it out.  I don't know why.  We don't need to do that.  We're not commercial radio.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Do we have Dirty Deeds?  Let's just fucking start over.  I want to play Dirty Deeds.  Let's see what it sounds like.  With the music.  We'll come back just like it's really.  With Dirty Deeds.  Yeah.  Coming back again, guys.  All right.  All right.  Good job, Sam.  We'll come back again.  Way to right the ship.  Okay.  Let's see how it works.  All right.  Let's sit.  We'll wait.  What the hell are you doing? 
[02:02:00]  In between tracks on the album.  You know, he always had that seven-second pause.  What are you nuts?  Get out of here.  Opie and Anthony mornings from 6 to 11 a.m.  The virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  Uneventful so far.  Yeah.  Same exact thing.  Yeah.  Not what I'd hoped for.  You could talk it up.  Absolutely.  Here we go. 
[02:02:30]  Hey, Opie and Anthony show.  Back.  Yeah.  Opie's not here because he has a sore throat.  Yes, he does.  Jim Florentine is, of course, in the studio.  Yeah, Florentine's here.  Kevin Smith, I think, overslept.  That's okay.  He's a busy man.  Yes, he is.  And...  No, I thought that was it.  How long is the intro?  Wow, this is a long intro song.  I think that he's playing the same one.  No, it is the same one.  It is the same one.  How did you do that?  You're an asshole.  That's how I do it. 
[02:03:00]  What a fuck.  Redo it.  All right, we're coming back again, guys.  Come on, come back again and do it right.  Jesus.  You suck.  There's two choices.  How did you make the wrong one?  God.  What a fucking fool.  Red wire, blue wire.  He blows up.  Oops.  Oh, come on.  Where are we at?  What are you doing?  Are you hitting the button for your dick?  The wheels fell off.  Coming back again.  What are you nuts?  Get out of here.  O.B. and Anthony mornings from 6 to 11 a.m. 
[02:03:30]  The virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  Ah.  We're back.  O.B. and Anthony show.  If he has one ounce of balls, he'll do it again.  I know.  If he had balls, but he doesn't.  No.  He has a big, deep vagina.  The woman that he is, Travis.  This is a wicked fucking beat, though, man.  That's a great riff.  I can hear something's a little different.  Yep.  Yeah, this is the remastered version.  Yes.  Oh, with the lyrics? 
[02:04:00]  Now it kicks in.  Right here.  There you go.  Yeah.  I hate it.  I hate it.  I can't do this.  Turn this shit off.  What the fuck, Travis?  God.  You're talking over vocals, guys.  Put your crappy music on there when we're trying to do a show.  That's Radio 101.  Never talk over vocals.  Why not?  Never talk over vocals.  Oh, yeah.  We don't talk over music beds anyway.  We're not a fucking zoo crew.  Talk right up till the vocals.  That's what you got to do to be annoying as hell.  Jimmy loves that, by the way.  It's just...  When rock radio talks and does the weather and stuff. 
[02:04:30]  When they know they got like a 45-second lead in their song.  And meanwhile, you might actually like that part of the song.  Yeah.  And I think when the guy wrote the song, he didn't think some dope hack would be talking  and telling the weather and traffic and fucking some shit show that's coming up over  your music.  Yeah.  And here it is.  If you...  We don't need you to talk.  On the cue.  And then bam, right into it.  Stop trying to impress other fucking jerk-offs in irrelevant radio.  You're fucking hitting the post.  That's...  The only person they're impressing is another idiot like themselves just going like, 
[02:05:00]  yeah, wow, he hit that post.  Nobody would complain if the guy just said, here's the song and then played it from the  beginning and shut his fucking yap.  Love that.  Would you complain the guy's not talking?  I would DJ in clubs and I would never talk over the songs.  And the management always go, come on, you got to, you know, talk it up.  Talk it up.  Get the people into it.  I'm like, no, I'm just going to play the song.  I'm not talking it up.  Shut up.  Plus, it was a strip club.  I was trying to get blown by the strippers.  Ah, yeah.  It should have been.  Yeah, so I was just rapping with them.  I wasn't going to talk on the mic.  So what were you playing? 
[02:05:30]  A lot of just metal, 80s metal?  Metal and all that.  So whatever songs they brought in.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And then throw, you know, a nice long one, like a six, seven minute one.  Yeah.  I'm going to back and get blown.  Rug act.  Did you ever get blown in the back?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  God damn.  Throw a nice long one on.  When you had long hair?  Yeah.  I remember you had a boss, because Jim, long hair helped Jim get blown all through the  80s.  Tell him about your fucking-  Into the 90s.  Who was your boss?  The fucking guy who had short hair? 
[02:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  He was a landscaper.  This guy was a real, like, nerd dude.  He was, like, 35 years old.  I swear, he had this really beautiful house in Jersey with a jacuzzi and stuff.  So he said, he goes, all right, when I hire you, he goes, look, if you can bring  girls home, because I used to work at this rock club about a mile from his place, and  he goes, if you bring girls home for me and I get laid, I'll give you a dollar an hour  raise.  Within three months, I was up to, like, 14 bucks an hour.  I was making more than the foreman.  The guy was there, like, 10 years, because I'd just bring these slobs back that were drunk.  Keep dragging these.  Yeah. 
[02:06:30]  Who was the guy that wore the wig?  He did.  He did it.  Oh, no way.  No way.  So I'd bring him back.  I'd go, hey, my friend's got a mansion.  You want to keep drinking?  He's got a jacuzzi.  This girl's like, yeah, let's go.  And I'd call him up.  I'd go, dude, pay phone back in the 80s.  I'd go, dude, I'm bringing two slobs over, so get up.  He's like, all right.  He gets a jacuzzi going.  We bang him all night.  So one time, we'd go to lunch with these two girls, right?  I met at the rock club.  And I'm like, hey, what about my friend?  You know, we'll go out tonight.  She goes, dude, like, sorry, we don't like guys with short hair.  He's like, are you serious? 
[02:07:00]  She goes, yeah.  And I go, so if he had long hair, it'd be fine.  She goes, absolutely, but you got short hair.  I'm not.  You're a nice guy.  You're good looking, but no.  All right, fine.  That night, right after that, I go, look, these girls are stupid.  We went to the mall.  We got them.  They're stupid.  Yeah, we went to the mall and got them a wig.  We went to a Halloween shop and put a wig on them.  How good could it have been?  It was awful.  It was fucking awful.  Do you look good in it?  It was a curly, long curly wig, like a brown wig.  And I told the girls, hey, my friend's having this party.  He's got a mansion, whatever, tonight. 
[02:07:30]  They're like, okay, fine.  That night, we show up at his house and knock on his door.  He's got the wig on.  He's like, hey, come on in, dude.  What's going on?  We wound up banging the girls that night.  The same day that he was at lunch with a girl, he fucked the girl seven hours later with a wig on.  She didn't know it was him.  And he had a bad mustache, too.  It was an awful, like Geraldo mustache.  It was hilarious.  And I told her, I said, dude, make sure you get her from behind because you don't want her on top.  She might pull your wig off.  I said, make sure you fuck her from behind.  And he got a choker with it. 
[02:08:00]  Beautiful.  Holy shit.  What's better than that?  That's great.  Fucking people.  Oh, big day.  Big day for, you might remember this name.  Sully.  No, no.  Not Godsmack.  From Godsmack?  Oh, I knew you were going to say that.  I saw them over the summer.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, they're really good.  I mean, Motley Crue had a real tough time after them.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they were a little younger, too.  Yeah.  Were they better than Motley Crue?  Could bring the energy a little better. 
[02:08:30]  Wasn't even close.  Yeah.  I love Motley Crue, but, I mean, Godsmack just amazing.  When they did a whole drum thing.  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  They were great, though.  Dueling drums.  That's the only drum solo I think I ever sat through and just go, oh, stop it.  Yeah, that's the only one you don't mind.  They're so self-indulgent, and I know a lot of drummers out there and stuff, but it's  like time to get the drink at the concert.  It's like, ah, I'm going to go grab something to drink.  All right. 
[02:09:00]  You're good.  We get it.  That's why we paid, and you're up there.  Play with the rest of the fucking band.  Oh, then when the rest of the crowd, like, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  The slow, yeah.  That slow.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  And he puts his hand in the rear.  Come on.  Can I hear you?  All right.  You can go slow, and then you can play fast.  Drum solo.  A Neil Peart drum solo I'd sit through.  Neil Peart I'd sit through.  How about Bill Ward?  Yeah, better respect. 
[02:09:30]  There are some with those, like, giant fucking ridiculous kits in the 80s that were kind  of cool to sit through and watch.  Ladies and gentlemen, Kevin Smith joining us here.  Please continue.  I'm enjoying.  Just talk.  Just talk about drum solos in bath.  Do you know Jim Florentine's, Kevin?  How are you, sir?  How are you, man?  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  Yeah.  If you're nice to him, he might put you in a movie.  That's what happened with Jimmy.  You look very good today.  Thank you.  I'm in the bags.  I was feeling thin, but you just-  I'm an alberge boy.  I know you're red bags, so we're close.  You look lost in weight.  Do I?  Yeah, absolutely.  Right on, man.  How are you?  Last time I saw you, he was in my house. 
[02:10:00]  Yes, it was cool.  God damn.  Kevin's exactly the way you think he's going to be at home.  Really?  He was kind of in a robe, like a fucking half asleep at one in the afternoon.  Like a junkie.  Rolled up, watched the flick.  It was so cool watching the film, but it was such a rough cut.  The music wasn't-  It was really like just watching a rough cut of a movie.  I'd like to see it like-  Wouldn't that be great if you just insulted him horribly and said, no, it was done.  Yeah, it was like, Jimmy, rough cut.  Rough cut, ain't it?  Hold on, I gotta make a phone call.  One brothers, apparently we're rough.  How many times?  No, it was rough.  It was like, music's missing and stuff like that. 
[02:10:30]  But, you know, it takes a certain skill to be able to look at a movie like that and  be able to fill in the blanks.  Some people watch it and be like, oh, this is horrible, dude.  And you're like, no, you're just not reacting.  You're reacting to the lack of music.  And then you'll turn on a music track.  They're like, wow, what'd you do?  That's a huge thing.  The music, obviously.  Another thing from watching movies that I can't even understand how it's done.  Because obviously nothing is filmed in sequence and stuff.  But to film a scene and have it cut with a whole other scene, like you got a car chase 
[02:11:00]  going on, but you also have like a bank robbery going on at the same time or some relationship  dialogue or something.  And then to, like I would just go, all right, car chase, now put the bank robbery, now put  the talk, now put, like to cut it together where you're actually having two or three different  things going on at the same time, it seems impossible to me to know how and where to  do that.  Boy, you sound like a young Pauline Kael with a cinematic dissertation on, I fucking lost 
[02:11:30]  you, dude.  What are we talking about?  It was just, I was talking about drum solos, but who gave a shit?  And then I'm just talking about like, like cutting together a movie, but like you go back  and forth from like maybe a scene at a club.  Yes.  And then to people that are driving in a car talking.  Yes.  I would continue, I would just continue until the talking in the car scene's done and over.  Until they pulled into the driveway and completely done.  You don't want to cut back and forth?  And then, yeah, to be able to cut back and forth and be like, wow, that kind of makes 
[02:12:00]  it exciting.  Is the simple cut to and fro?  Is that what you're going to?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, fuck, you never do that.  The long story short is pedestrian cuts excite you.  Is that what it is?  All right.  That's pretty easy.  Back and forth.  No, I was noticing the other day, I was just watching a movie going like, how do you just, how  do you fucking even know to do that?  How do you know to go?  That's a good spot to interrupt this storyline.  There's a flow.  And throw it in there.  It's like how people ask you, how do you know how to, how to start talking, stop talking?  Oh, I don't.  How do you have so much to say?  I apparently don't.  I was talking about drum solos and I just stopped. 
[02:12:30]  I know.  You did leave it go and I feel bad.  That's all right.  The drum solo, where are we going to go with that anyway?  There's nothing to go?  There's nowhere to go.  I heard Neil Pertin.  I was like, rush, what up?  And then all of a sudden, hey, Kevin.  We could just do a pedestrian cut and talk about this for a while and then go back to the drum  solo.  Let's do it.  Let's cut to like me outside going like, I'm so tired.  I better not.  You know what?  I'll go in there and put on a good show because those dudes are always live.  They'll come in and it's like, so drum solos.  Yeah.  You guys like some drum solos?  It's felt like I walked into NPR.  What the fuck's going on, man?  Let's chat.  Yeah. 
[02:13:00]  Hey, look, I just pulled my chair up and everything.  You did.  You're on fire.  Let's go back to the house.  The big question you had back at the house when you got watching a movie with Jim, how many  times did he make you stop so he had to go piss?  No, the good thing is I abandoned him in the room with other people and I showed him where  the, I said, this button.  Is this like a keyboard on a computer?  Is this a space bar?  I'll stop it or start it.  Here's a volume.  You guys are on your own.  So I don't, I didn't sit outside to be like, you know, hello, James, are you pissing again?  You know, I just let him watch the flick.  But there was a piss story.  Remember the dude who was in the room, Adam Siegel? 
[02:13:30]  I don't know who was who.  Who was the guy I was sitting next to?  Probably Adam Siegel.  There was a guy who you were talking about scenes.  Like, hey, what do you think of this scene?  What do you think of that scene?  And then there was a guy behind who was taking notes, more like an editing type thing.  The guy behind was a dude who has nothing to do with the movie.  He's a guy named John Gordon, a friend of ours who just came by to watch it.  The dude sitting next to you, Adam Siegel, he actually worked on the movie.  What does he do?  He's one of the producers.  Well, didn't he know nothing about it, though?  That, then it's vice versa.  Then Adam was the one standing behind you and John was the one.  Yeah, that's right.  John Gordon sitting next to you.  And I kept going like, dude, that's a stupid suggestion. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I hope Jim didn't try to add anything in.  He was not on fire that morning.  And I was kind of quick with him.  But anyway, yeah, Adam was the dude behind him.  Adam, he goes the other day, he's just like, hey, man, like, I thought Norton was cool.  And I said, Norton is cool.  And he's like, I went into the bathroom after Norton.  He pissed all over the seat.  Oh, did I really?  And I go, hold on.  I go, what do you mean the seat?  And he goes, well, not the seat seat, but he lifted it.  But it's like the spray all over the bowl and shit.  And I was like, that don't sound like Jim.  I mean, unless there was like a hooker involved. 
[02:14:30]  I doubt there's piss flying everywhere.  And he goes, well, I just, I had to clean it up myself and whatnot.  And I was like, you cleaned up his piss?  He's like, yeah, it just felt wrong.  You did that to your bowl.  And then I was like, wait, Adam, are you talking about the bathroom in the hallway?  He's like, yeah, the really low toilet.  I was like, dude, that just has this weird splatter effect.  It doesn't matter.  You can hit dead center in a dry bowl and it's going to pop up.  It's the altitude.  Yeah, it's the altitude and based on the height of the bowl.  And the dude was so fucking relieved.  He was like, oh, because I really liked Norton. 
[02:15:00]  And to think that he would.  But that was going to turn him off to you.  Which guy?  Adam Siegel, the glasses.  Why?  I guess he didn't find where Jimmy took a shit in the tank in the back of the head.  Yeah, exactly.  I was taken aback by how taken aback he was.  I piss all over my own seat in the twilight.  I lift it up and I get it on the floor.  Yeah, you clean up after, you know.  Exactly.  Maybe in a week.  It was a splatter effect.  It really captures imagination in a negative way.  It's hilarious.  He wanted me booted out of the movie for pissing on Kevin, fucking tinkling on his seat.  Just rip out a handful of pubes, lay them all over the seat, fucking blood piss shit.  Let's cut the whole Norton scene. 
[02:15:30]  I was like, but it works for the movie.  He's like, doesn't matter.  Anybody pisses on a seat, I ain't putting them full.  Norton, don't get that part.  It's perfect for him.  He pissed all over the seat.  It was the best toilet I ever had.  Wiping lessons.  Flushing lessons.  I thought it was kind, though, because it wasn't even his toilet.  It was reacting like that.  I think it would be great for somebody to actually be removed from a movie and never know why.  And that's the reason.  Find out 20 years later.  That's the reason.  No, it was because you pissed on the seat.  We thought you were great, but it was, you know, you pissed all over Kevin's seat. 
[02:16:00]  You were poised for stardom, but then you pissed on the seat.  I'll be like Waltz in Godfather.  He ain't getting that part.  He pissed on the seat.  Were you just listening to me and Jimmy?  No, that's what we were doing.  Were you talking about Waltz?  I was saying wiping lessons, flushing lessons.  It's the best toilet I've ever had, and I pissed all over the world.  And then he comes with his shaman, his soft bathroom tissue.  That's funny.  So is it almost done?  Flick-wise? 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  We're pretty much there at this point.  I mean, we got a locked, and I wouldn't call it locked.  We got a cut that's kind of locked to the time being.  Down an hour and 44 minutes, and we're going to show that to the studio.  And in the studio, I assume we'll have notes and whatnot, and then we'll go out and test it.  Do you get a little nervous when your star is in another movie that just came out?  Oh, The Surrogates?  Yeah, yeah.  No.  No?  Not really.  I mean, I don't get nervous about much anymore, dude.  So stone, doesn't matter. 
[02:17:00]  It's all going to work out.  That's what I've learned.  It's all just going to work out.  It all works out.  And I did my job.  They hired me to make a funny movie.  Jim, did I make a funny movie?  Yes, of course.  So boom, I did my job, and it's up to them now to sell it.  And for years, I used to try to do both.  But hey, man, compartmentalize.  Look at you.  Do my job.  Let them do their job.  And we'll stay in their kitchen and whatnot.  Yeah.  You used to have your hands in there right up to the end and everything.  Well, it's like this year at San Diego Comic Con.  We were in the midst of shooting, and I went out because I do a panel there every year. 
[02:17:30]  This big room, 6,000-seater.  And every year, I'd go, and if I had a movie coming out in the next six months, I'd bring a clip and shit.  But so I was heading out for this, and I was like, so I'm going to bring the clip of Sean William Scott and Bruce and Tracy in the car.  It's a pretty funny scene.  I think it'll go over here who's there.  And the Warner Brothers people were like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hey, let's slow our roll there, buddy.  Slow our roll.  I was like, what do you mean?  They're like, well, we don't know what the movie looks like yet.  Like, we'd rather see the whole movie before we decide which foot to put forward. 
[02:18:00]  And I was just like, what do you mean which foot to put forward?  Like, it was a whole new world for me because I was just used to, like, you know, kind of leading the charge with the PR on the movie and talking about the movie like two years before it even starts.  As soon as I have footage, putting it out there, you know, taking it to the show or whatever.  And it never worked.  Movies never did well.  But still, you know, I felt like if I hadn't done that, they wouldn't have done the business they did do.  And all of a sudden, I'm in this world where they're like, hey, jackass, we'll just pour money on it and it'll happen. 
[02:18:30]  Like, that's what we do at studios.  We open movies that way.  We're not going to make you do it, Kevin.  You can't go open the movie yourself.  Yeah, like, just ease up.  Your job here is done.  Totally.  They're like, look, you concentrate on the funny ha-ha and we'll figure out how to sell your movie.  And I was like, wow, all right.  That's cool.  So I concentrated on the work.  You don't have to sell it.  I didn't bring the clip.  I went to San Diego Clipless and shit.  Wow.  Were people pissed at you?  Yeah, we just talked a little while more.  But the shitty thing was I did follow the Iron Man panel and they had clips. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, shit.  So, like, you come up, they're like, what do you got, man?  I'm like, nothing.  I'm just here to talk about how fat I am and how much pot I smoke.  I got a little dick.  And they're like, wow, we just saw Iron Man a few minutes ago.  But still, I mean, I guess they had the right idea.  It's just like, hey, you do what you do, we do what we do.  And they felt like putting anything out there before they know what they got.  Their whole thing was like, what if you cut that scene out of the movie?  And I was like, oh, it's impossible.  It's too funny.  But they were like, yeah, but what if you do?  And then people are like, what happened to that scene? 
[02:19:30]  And then there's a controversy about the missing scene.  Like, they think 26 steps ahead, man.  That's so fucked up because you coming from such an indie background.  I mean, the indiest indie ever background.  Let me take my own money and make a movie.  To the point where, you know, Warner Brothers.  I had to just do it once.  Just once.  That was it, man.  I mean, could you imagine there are poor motherfuckers out there who are just doing that all the time.  You know, this dude who's been working in New York for years, used to, I don't even know if it does anymore, named John Jost, used to make these little movies he put together on a nothing budget. 
[02:20:00]  This dude out west, Henry J. Glom.  Sometimes you hear his name and whatnot.  He always has one billboard on Sunset Avenue.  These are dudes who have been made.  Henry J. Glom has made like 28 movies.  You don't know his name.  And you've probably never heard of any of the movies.  But these are dudes who like do it consistently.  They put their own money into it.  They keep working.  I did Clerks, dude.  I did it once.  It was like I'm the jackass who walks to the casino where a dude's feeding the machine for four days.  And then he's like, he turns around to light a cigarette. 
[02:20:30]  And I'm like, ooh.  And I pull it once.  And it's like.  And they both just look at me.  I'm like, sorry.  It's like, what happened?  Yeah, what did you do different?  Exactly.  And sometimes I feel bad because it's weird.  Like when you say like, you know, you're a self-made man.  And I'm like, yeah, I am.  But I really only had to do it once.  And I've never been called upon to do it again.  That'll be a true test.  Like I'm no longer like an indie guy because I could make Red State.  But I won't pay for it because I'm like, why the fuck would I invest in a Kevin Smith movie?  Especially with my own money. 
[02:21:00]  You followed it up with good movies, though.  So if you followed it up with shit, you would have gotten nowhere.  That's very, very true.  I mean, once I got my foot in the door, I tried to keep the quality consistent.  But still, it was just like every time I hear that, I'm like, wow, I'm kind of cool.  And then I go, no, I only had to do it once.  And then motherfuckers would do it all the time.  Why is there that perception then that you are?  Because you're known as the ultimate Cinderella story.  And for years, dude, 15 years, they always call me indie director Kevin Smith.  And it's like, I always push them toward cult director because I'm like, indie, dude.  No, you're just sucking corporate cock.  I'm the indie guy. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, I mean, I'm cool.  Exactly.  I've got Mickey Mouse's dick in my house.  It's 94, dude.  You've got a W and a B tattoo on each cheek.  Absolutely.  Each one of my balls, WB.  This one's Harry.  This one's Jack.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's weird.  People have that perception because of the first flick.  Yeah.  That's the label.  I mean, look, dude, I realize it doesn't matter.  I could accidentally cure cancer in the next 20 years.  My obituary will still read.  Clerks die.  Kevin Smith.  Clerks.  Dead at 30. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, shit.  Or whatever it is.  You know, it's just very.  And that's fine.  I dig it.  But I feel bad sometimes when people just give you more credit than you really do.  And it's like, well, you know, I was an indie guy once.  And then somebody has paid for my ride every time since then.  Guys are out there in the trenches.  Totally.  You're one of the astronauts.  And poor Chuck Yeager's still out there trying to break the sound barrier.  Yeah.  Yeah, really.  That's true, man.  I am.  I'm kind of, I'm Gus Grissom.  Yeah, you're Gus Grissom.  I'm motherfucking who like blew the bolts too early the second time. 
[02:22:30]  I'm like, hey, it blew itself.  It wasn't me.  It wasn't me.  But I'm Gus Grissom, dude.  Picking up his dimes that went into space.  I could tell you.  Fucking Gus Grissom.  I'm out there in the press.  I'm like, where's my parade?  Yeah.  His dimes went into space?  Oh, he took.  Do you remember?  Do you ever see the right stuff?  I don't remember.  I've seen the right stuff where it's like Fred Ward plays Gus Grissom.  And he, like, the first, first moon, you know, the shot into space, the moon landing  and shit like that.  First one happened.  The whole world's like, woo, it's amazing. 
[02:23:00]  And then they do the next one, which he was captain of or part of.  It was just one guy.  It was like one Mercury capsule.  John Glenn was first and then this guy was going.  Alan Shepard went up first.  And then did the circle.  Into space.  Didn't even orbit.  John Glenn orbited first.  And Gus Grissom was the next one up.  So he goes up and he brought a bunch of dimes with him.  They show a scene before he goes up, he's in a bar, and he's like, you know, he's married  dude, but hitting on chicks going like, you know, I'm an astronaut. 
[02:23:30]  You know, I want one of these dimes.  I'm going into space.  He's taking a roll of dimes into space so that when he comes back, he can be like, this  dime was in space.  He has a space dime.  He never occurred to him to just fucking lie and be like, this dime was in space.  What a dummy.  And then he goes up.  What are they still going to be cold when he hands it to a chick?  He goes up and he does his trip, but he panics.  He's not, at least it's depicted in the movie.  I have no idea if this is historically accurate, but that movie's pretty tight and pretty historically  accurate.  They depict him as like kind of panicking and upon re-entry, really freaked out. 
[02:24:00]  And the capsule crash lands in the water.  But what freaked him out coming back through?  I can't remember specifically.  The chutes popped, but he was getting some kind of a warning that the inflatable didn't  pop and the capsule would have sunk.  Right.  That was it.  So instead of waiting for the frog man to come down and open the hatch for him, he blew  the bolts on the hatch.  And they lost the capsule.  And the capsule sank into the ocean.  And they hook it up to the helicopter and the helicopter's like being pulled down and 
[02:24:30]  they had to blow the bolts on that and the capsule actually sunk.  So they lost millions of dollars because they would take it back, analyze it, what happened  to it.  That capsule is actually in the Air and Space Museum.  They pulled it up.  Yeah.  It's pretty cool to fucking look in that thing and just be like, wow.  Oh, wow.  How small is it?  It's a Mercury capsule.  It's with one man.  You're just sitting.  It's a chair with just metal around it.  You're just sitting in.  How long were you up for?  Well, it'll depend.  If you're doing orbits, you were up for a few hours. 
[02:25:00]  I don't think Mercury's astronauts were up there more than a few hours.  They weren't up there for like days.  That's for sure.  Did you guys ever do a few orbits?  I mean, yeah.  They do a couple orbits and come down.  Yeah.  And then Gemini, they went with the two guys and stayed up a little longer.  I always love their explanation of like flying gas cam where they're just like, they're  sitting on like something like 10,000 gallons of fuel.  Just for fuel.  Of gasoline.  Yeah.  Of fuel.  Not even gasoline.  Just whatever that pure fuel is.  It's a giant thing.  And the actual component that they're in and come back in is this little thing. 
[02:25:30]  It took all this shit to get you up there.  Did you ever see the footage of the guy, Joe Kittinger, from, he was the guy, he has  the highest recorded jump from a parachute.  He goes up to 102,000 feet.  Danny, you could possibly.  102,000.  Normally, it's like what?  30,000, 40,000.  That's a high jump.  Yeah.  Well, 30,000 is like, we're cruising at 30,000 feet.  So it's probably not that.  It's probably like 15.  15 or something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like normal.  15,000.  When people normally parachute, it's probably about 15,000. 
[02:26:00]  12,000 to 15,000.  Yeah, this guy had a space.  And this dude was in 20,000.  It was a military exercise.  Really?  Yeah.  He was 102,000 feet.  I like when Norton explains shit, man.  He gets a serious face.  I do.  Very serious.  It was a military exercise.  Like, it was almost like, Kevin, this isn't.  I can't talk fucking.  We're not even running around, Kevin.  This dude is fucking nasty.  I can't even explain the rest of it.  It's top secret.  Military exercise.  All jokes aside, Kev.  Boring story coming.  You get really earnest.  You're like, oh, yeah, it's military.  It's because I want to be listened to just once as a serious.  Like, whenever I talk about trannies, the room stops or fucking getting pissed on. 
[02:26:30]  But just once, I want to talk about the army.  The army.  You make it sound funny.  Oh, this dude literally parachuted in space.  Look at how high up he is.  It really is the brink of space that this guy is in.  How do you step out of that little gondola that he's in?  I'd call back.  Could you guys bring me back?  I'm nervous.  There's no coming back.  The sky isn't blue anymore.  It's completely black.  It's so dark, man.  You can see the curvature of the earth.  Oh, my God.  And he just jumps down.  And he's going to jump to a cloud bank.  Yeah.  Yeah, because it was cloudy that day. 
[02:27:00]  But look at it.  He said he didn't feel like he was falling.  They lost him.  He didn't feel like he was falling.  So he said the camera footage you see of the balloon is from his helmet.  That's from his camera.  From his helmet cam.  He's in outer space.  You can see the atmosphere.  That's so fucked up.  You can see the atmosphere.  You can see the blue of the atmosphere.  Obviously, he's not going through it.  It's a breathing apparatus.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's on a chair, too.  But he didn't think he was falling because the air is so thin.  So he had to look back up at the fucking balloon to realize he was going farther away from it.  Yeah, because you're not going to feel the air resistance against it because there's no air up there. 
[02:27:30]  That would be hilarious if a plane just went by and just...  What the hell was that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Fine.  Shutdown number two.  We can make it.  We didn't think it was a bird.  But when he's falling, you can see the curvature of the earth on the other side.  It's so weird.  I'd be so freaked out that I was going to miss the planet.  Oh, that's great.  I mean, isn't there like that when they're like, all right, upon re-entry, you're going  to hit the whatever they call it. 
[02:28:00]  The atmosphere.  The atmosphere.  Is he...  He's inside the atmosphere?  If he was outside, he'd be a little...  You'd see a little...  He'd float away.  No, he would actually...  Yeah.  First of all, you'd probably...  It would take you a little while longer to get in.  Right.  Because of the lack of gravity.  But once he got a hold of you and pulled you through, you're done.  Burnt up like a fucking...  But would you burn coming through slowly, though?  I think what...  I don't know if you'd burn coming through slowly because what burns you through the atmosphere  is the friction of you hitting the air and slowing down.  Yeah, but you're not going to go slowly. 
[02:28:30]  Especially with the lack of air...  Wind resistance.  Did you ever find out when he pulled the cord at what height?  It does it automatically.  20,000 feet, I want to say.  He fell for a few minutes.  He fell for 80,000 feet.  Yeah.  Can you imagine during those few minutes what's going through your mind?  It's like, please open.  Please open.  Please open.  Please open.  Please open.  That's all that's going through.  That's not the act.  That's different.  That's not him falling through.  Oh, okay.  Now it's different stuff.  Suddenly he's in the ocean.  I want to answer...  I don't think you can fall slow, though.  I don't think it's possible.  That's why these ships come through so fast. 
[02:29:00]  They're in orbit.  I don't think you could...  If you actually took a human being and threw him through the atmosphere, you'd fucking burn up.  But you'd have to.  You're not coming through it.  Yeah, you'd have to.  And you're maintaining that it's what?  It's the...  I don't know.  Somebody out there must know.  It is friction.  Once the air starts getting thicker, you're going so fast that the friction with the air molecules just heats you up.  You're going 17,000 miles an hour when you come back through.  Yeah.  And then you've got to slow down. 
[02:29:30]  But if you're a person, you're just outside, and you're somehow able to get dropped through,  because you have to come through at a certain angle, you're going to bounce off the atmosphere and keep going.  Would you build up enough speed...  To fall through it.  To burn up.  And would you burn, or is the heat just the friction of the atmosphere that you wouldn't feel if you were coming through at a much slower speed?  Let's get a rock.  I've asked this question to many girls while fucking them.  Where's Michio Kaku?  He wouldn't have a real answer.  No.  Well, you know, falling through space is like when you throw a rock into Alice's house.  Thanks.  He's used some kind of thing. 
[02:30:00]  It is like when Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck...  We had Michio Kaku on here.  Do you know who he is?  Famed physicist Michio Kaku.  He's on Discovery Channel all the time and everything.  And he's talking about string theory and all that, but he's trying to put it in layman's terms so he can almost understand it.  And he kept using examples of cartoons and Disney stuff and movies.  And we're like, you're just treating us like retarded children.  And then he kind of made it look like, well, that's who you are.  You're just retarded children.  How am I going to explain a wormhole to you? 
[02:30:30]  You're dumb.  Exactly.  That's what he was looking at.  A fucking hole that management crawls through.  Hey, maybe...  Scumbag hole.  If I'm the worm.  If fucking Steve is listening, Dr. Steve,  he was a physics major in school.  I'm curious about that, though.  How high can you go?  Because the guy just tried to break the record, but he had mechanical problems.  How high can you go?  Like, if you just sat in your balloon, how high would it go and what would happen?  Would you eventually just come back down or would it burn up when it hit a certain height?  I would imagine it would have to burn up once it hit that atmosphere. 
[02:31:00]  What happens?  I don't know.  Well, it says here, contrary to popular belief,  things entering the atmosphere at high velocities do not burn up because of air friction against the object.  That's what I was saying.  Instead, what happens is the object is moving so fast,  the air molecules can't move aside quickly enough,  and this results in the air becoming highly compressed,  and like any compressed gas, the air itself becomes very hot.  So it's actually the air surrounding the object that burns it up.  Wow, man.  So if you came through slower, that wouldn't happen.  The air would move.  Excuse me, Harvey.  Well, I guess it wouldn't be compressed.  Now the ships are in orbit. 
[02:31:30]  Force field.  Force field.  Need a force field.  The ships themselves.  Artificial gravity.  Those are words you throw out on sci-fi movies.  It's just like, all right, I buy it.  Yeah, that's good.  Force field.  Okay, they'll be fine.  I'm still in it.  Artificial gravity.  I'm still with the movie.  What was the other one?  Stasis.  Stasis.  Didn't the robot from Lost in Space have that force field thing going on?  He probably did.  Yeah, he did.  He had one of those.  Warning.  Warning.  That guy, yeah.  He would shield Will Robinson so he could be molested by the older gentleman.  Dr. Smith. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, dear.  Everyone step back.  Dr. Smith is horny.  I love it when he grabbed Will and hold him in front of him.  Oh, help me, dear boy.  Yuck.  Oh, good.  Dr. Steve's on time.  All right, let's go to him.  All right.  It's my job.  Hi, Dr. Steve.  Hello, boys.  I just wanted to look smart in front of Kevin Smith.  Yes.  Can you hear, Kev?  I do.  I hear now.  Okay, he's got the thing on.  Well, Dr. Steve, have you been listening?  Yes, absolutely.  So now you know that a ship coming into the Earth's atmosphere has been in orbit, 
[02:32:30]  so it does have to hit the atmosphere at, what, 14,000 miles an hour around there?  If you just took an elevator up into space and then dropped down, like this guy did with the balloon,  you're not going to go into orbit.  Right.  You have to have some lateral motion, and it's really fast,  because all you're doing is you're falling, and as Jimmy said, missing the Earth.  So to do that, you've got to go really fast.  And so when those spaceships come in, they're having to lose velocity, all that kinetic energy, 
[02:33:00]  and that's what really burns them up, and they have to use the ablative heat shields and all that stuff.  So, Steve, I'm sorry, but I got it.  No, go ahead.  When Joe Kittinger went up in that balloon, it was 102,000 feet.  How much higher could he have gone in that balloon, and what would have happened if he just kept going?  Well, like if he had gone up to 100 miles and dropped in, is that what you're asking? 
[02:33:30]  Well, how much higher, 102,000 feet?  The balloon can't go that high.  It's 20 miles or so.  How much more room did he have before he reached the edge of the atmosphere?  Oh, he was really close there.  Really, I believe that they say 50 miles is considered space,  but between 20 miles and 50 miles, there's almost no, you know, very little air.  So the balloon will only rise to the point where there's nothing. 
[02:34:00]  It won't go up any more than that because it rises because its density is less than air,  just like a bubble in water, you know, will always rise up until it gets to the point where it can't rise.  So what would happen when he hit that point?  Would he just kind of stay there like a balloon on a ceiling, or would it just come back down?  No, he would sort of, he would go, there would be some momentum upward,  so he would float up to a certain point where gravity would then counteract that,  and so he'd kind of bounce up and down between, I don't know, 20 and 50 miles. 
[02:34:30]  Someone who's a balloon expert may be able to.  I would think the balloon would pop because the pressure inside of the balloon,  the higher you go and the less air pressure that's around it,  once you have, like, zero air pressure, the balloon would pop.  You can only go to zero.  You can't go to negative pressure.  So if your balloon is constructed, I mean, why don't air, uh, patients pop?  I mean, you know, you can make a balloon for the ball.  Well, his balloon was a really long, thin one. 
[02:35:00]  It was like 600 feet.  It looked like a giant condom.  It was not round.  It was a really long, weird balloon.  It's like a turned upside down ball bag on a hot day.  Well, if you want to be scientific about it, yes.  Was the hairs on it?  Technical jargon.  So wait, so he would just kind of bounce back.  Could he get to a point where he would jump and just float or no?  No, no, because to float, you have to be in orbit, and so you'd need a lateral velocity.  In other words, a velocity of...  25,000 miles an hour. 
[02:35:30]  Well, that's escape velocity.  When he hit, that little ceiling in space just started bouncing a little bit.  Like you said, the gravity kind of fighting with complete airlessness.  What would happen if he could climb up on top of that balloon just as he bounced, or is it not that close to space?  Oh, I see what you're saying.  You mean...  No, but he still wouldn't go into orbit.  You've got to have that lateral velocity parallel to the Earth.  But he wouldn't float. 
[02:36:00]  No, Earth's gravity is going to pull you back every time.  It's just...  Gravity is always going to pull you toward the center, and the reason that spaceships can stay in orbit and people float around is because they're moving so fast that as they fall toward the center of the Earth, they continue to miss the Earth.  So they just fall around it.  It's a fine balance of you're actually falling toward the Earth, but you've powered yourself to keep missing it.  So the Earth's gravity is keeping you in orbit, but you're not crashing into the Earth because you're going fast enough to throw yourself away from it still. 
[02:36:30]  So it's a balancing act.  And, Jimmy, think about a geosynchronous satellite like the communications satellite.  Like our own SiriusXM satellites.  Exactly.  They're up at about 24,000 miles, and when they fall, they're falling around the Earth, but they do it at the same rate that the Earth rotates, so it always appears to be over the same point in the sky.  It's really very cool.  And, um... 
[02:37:00]  Oh, fuck.  There was another question I had about, uh...  Oh!  Hemorrhoids?  Yes.  Why do penises hurt my bottom when I have hemorrhoids?  No, what about, uh...  What is gimbal lock?  What the fuck is gimbal lock?  That was...  Talking about...  From Apollo 13.  Yeah.  We're flirting with gimbal lock here.  What is gimbal lock?  A gimbal lock is where you've got gyroscopes, right?  And they...  If you have three gyroscopes, you can keep track of your position relative to some point that's relative to the Earth. 
[02:37:30]  And so if you rotate, those gyroscopes will rotate in the opposite direction, and you can sense that.  You put sensors on it, and you can tell what your relative motion is.  Well, if you move so fast, the sensors can only sense movement of those gyroscopes, and they'll lock up, and that's gimbal lock.  Now, how do you get out of that if they lock up? 
[02:38:00]  Well, what you have to do, then, is to stop your motion and then reset all your gyroscopes again.  So you can't do that in space?  Well, you can, but you have to go through a procedure to do it.  They've had enough problems.  All right.  Nice.  Gimbal lock.  I'm a pilot about that.  They can tell you more about gimbal lock.  I still don't know what it means, but I have enough where if someone said, what's gimbal lock, I'm like, yeah, it's all about the gyroscopes and the motion.  That's all I wanted.  I'd get, like, a three-word answer.  All right, Steve.  Thank you very much.  If a speedometer being pegged to the limit, you can't...  If your speedometer only goes up to 140, and you're going 150, you can't tell that. 
[02:38:30]  That's all.  I don't know.  I was just reading Lady Trucker's phone call.  What'd she say?  She goes, Learning Channel Jimmy Z.  That's the fucking...  That's the size on her shirt.  Fucking fat monster.  You have a fucking stroke.  Hope your teeth hit the steering wheel and you fucking hit an abutment.  Big fucking fatso. 
[02:39:00]  Shut up.  No one believes that.  When I used to live with him, I used to say, no, you're like, what was it like living with that guy?  I go, he's actually well-read.  They're like, how could he be?  Yeah, what?  He is.  Yeah.  Lady Trucker.  I hope right now, Lady Trucker, I hope that big rotten foot is going...  And her fucking heel is hitting the floor where the brakes should be slowing her vehicle down.  And she knows she has a fucking gas tanker behind her.  It's a jackknife in our future.  Yeah.  I hope the only thing not burned on her is the bottom left part of her calf. 
[02:39:30]  And then she shows that off with knickers.  She's the star of Weird Medicine, by the way, on drsteve.com.  Is she really?  What are you doing on Weird Medicine with her?  She called in a question about trucker duties.  And if she's on the line, you need to ask her about it.  I thought maybe you were doing something about how she was in the Antarctica frozen.  And they said the meat was still fresh enough to eat.  And now it drives a truck.  I'd like to take her arm fat from the back and just step on it until she yells, uncle. 
[02:40:00]  All right, drsteve.com, is that it?  Yeah, yeah.  I think her big trucker duty thing was on the three-hour fecalicious extravaganza.  Fecalicious?  Sounds fantastic.  We played it on the virus a couple of weeks ago, but she was definitely the star.  And then we've had several truckers.  By size, you mean that, right? 
[02:40:30]  Speaking of space.  Speaking of density.  Exactly.  She was definitely the neutron star.  But, yeah, we've done a whole series on how truckers eliminate their bowels and void their awful bladders while they're driving.  It's really kind of funny.  She's horrid.  All right, drsteve.  Thank you for your help.  Bye, boys.  Bye, Angel.  He's so smart.  Yes, he is.  He's so smart, drsteve.  In school, I think.  How did he become a doctor, doctor?  I think he used to get tired of fucking space. 
[02:41:00]  He wanted to fucking feel a few clits.  That's all it is.  He used to program terrible video games back in the early 80s.  Did he?  Yeah, he did like terrible, like before Atari games, he used to work on the code.  Wow, like basic?  Yeah.  He'd program basic?  Who is that guy?  Yeah, he's a smart dude.  Yeah, he did like this guy, Dr. Steve.  He's a doctor, but he knows a lot about science, and he used to like program the music, I think, for these terrible old video games.  Get out of here, really?  I forget the names.  He emailed me a few times.  For Pong.  For Pong.  Yeah, pretty much.  We're not exactly so removed. 
[02:41:30]  Over and over.  Horrible MIDI music, yeah.  Over and over.  They're knocking down Giant Stadium?  Is that what I'm reading?  Yeah, they're building a new one.  Where?  Right next to it.  It's like twice the size of Giant Stadium.  If you fly over it, have you seen it?  No.  It's insane.  But yeah, they knock it down, I think, right after the season.  Yeah.  And did they replace Mets Stadium already?  Shea is now shitty feels.  It's the city feels.  And what's the other one? 
[02:42:00]  And Yankee Stadium, which is, of course, Yankee Stadium.  The old Yankee Stadium's still there, though.  That's still there?  Yeah, they haven't knocked that down yet.  They're ripping that apart, like, piece by piece so they can sell it.  Are they really?  No one really cares about, like, Shea.  Why won't they let them play hockey in there, man?  That's what they should do, like, the Winter Classic.  Hockey.  Or a version of the Winter Classic.  Hockey.  And they might be able to in the new Yankee Stadium.  I was just there the other day.  Fucking amazing.  With the new Yankee Stadium?  I haven't been there yet.  It's retarded.  Cool.  Like, great.  You know, the thing that amazed me the most is the sound.  Like, every announcement, everything is crystal clear. 
[02:42:30]  Where, you know, you start...  It used to be shitty, yeah.  That speaker all the way out in center field.  Now, no matter where you are in the park, you're hearing everything that's being said.  You're really kind of blasted with advertising.  You thought it was bad, like, at any other stadium.  Now it's just huge video screens everywhere just blasting you with advertisements of everything.  They've got to find a way to get adverts in front of your eyes now.  Because nobody watches TV like they used to.  And everything now, dude.  It has, like, a fucking advertisement in front of it.  They've got stores, museums.  I want it to a food store, man. 
[02:43:00]  Like, I think The Good Wife is going to be on TV soon.  Because I am inundated by The Good Wife images.  Everywhere it goes, Julianna Margulies.  And even, like, when you go into the CVS at a right-in and have those security bars that you have to walk through,  they have things that go over the bars now.  They figure it out.  It's just, like, one more place to put up advertising.  Yep, I was watching some classic, classic ball games the other day on ESPN Classic.  And it's amazing how there was just no advertising.  There's no, no, the graphics were horrendous. 
[02:43:30]  Nothing, the graphics were really bad.  They put the score up and it was this bad, like, it wasn't, you couldn't even call it pixelated.  It looked like it was cut out of construction paper with dull scissors.  Yeah.  Like, really bad.  It would move ever so slightly.  Yeah, yeah, it wasn't synced up with the screen.  It looked like floaters in your eye.  Really bad.  It wasn't the fucking, uh, the Mitsubishi instant replay or, oh, it's the fucking un-listenable.  Yeah, now everything becomes the bullpen, whatever, Toyota.  It's called the bullpen sponsored by AT&T's call to the bullpen. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, that's, yeah.  And Hagi, too.  It's just like, it's another PSN ENG power play.  It's like, oh, all right.  Everything is sponsored.  Apparently, the electric company is sponsoring the power play.  And it's the, everything, uh, when you're at the park and they're making announcements,  it's, you know, the official potato chip of the New York Yankees.  Who cares what they use?  The official, it's everything.  And at that point, I, like, throw my uts on the ground and pick up whatever the official brand is.  Where is the official brand? 
[02:44:30]  I feel like a treacherous fool.  Wise.  Have you guys heard, you probably have, because you guys listen to a lot of shit online, but  I heard something this morning that made me laugh so hard.  This clip of, uh, a cop who, like, overdosed on weed brownies and then calls in.  Weed brownies?  Weed brownies.  Oh, wait a minute.  He confiscated a bunch of weed and then him and his wife made weed brownies.  Yeah, I think we did.  Yeah, that, yeah.  And then he calls 911 because he's freaking out.  He thinks he's going to die.  He thinks he's going to die.  Time has slowed down.  And then he comes out with these weird non-sequiturs.  And he's like, what's the score of the Wings game? 
[02:45:00]  And she's like, I don't watch the Wings, sir.  And he's like, well, I'm just, I'm trying to see if I'm having a hallucination.  Is it 3-3?  And she looks and she goes, it's 2-2.  And he goes, come quickly.  Can we hear that?  Yeah, Travis, he's got it in the other room.  Okay, cool.  You sure you don't want to play the rejoiner again, Travis?  Ass.  Get one, it's emergency.  Yeah, can you please send rescue to, I think I'm having an overdose as soon as my wife.  Okay, you and your wife?  Yes. 
[02:45:30]  Overdose of what?  Marijuana.  I don't know if it had something in it.  Okay.  Can you please send rescue?  Please come.  Okay, well, on the way, are you guys like, do you guys have fever or anything?  No, I'm just, I think we're dying.  How much did you guys have?  I don't know.  We made brownies.  And I think we're dead.  I really do.  Okay, how much did you put in the brownies?  I don't know.  Was it a bag?  Who made the brownies?  My wife and I did. 
[02:46:00]  Cuba, come here.  Okay, get her.  She's on the living room ground right now.  Is she breathing?  She's barely breathing.  Is she awake?  I think so.  Okay, can you look?  Pardon?  Can you look?  Yeah, I can feel her.  She's laying right down in front of me.  Time is going by really, really, really, really slow.  Do you guys do this on a regular basis?  No, this is the first time that we've ever done it.  And you've never done marijuana before?  Yeah, I have. 
[02:46:30]  You have?  And you've never had this reaction to it before?  No, ever.  He's just freaking out.  What's the score in the Red Wings game?  What?  What's the score in the Red Wings game?  I've got no clue.  I don't watch the Red Wings.  Okay, I just want to make sure this isn't some type of, like, hallucination that I'm having.  Oh, why?  What does the score say?  Three to three.  When channel is it on?  Um, channel two.  Uh, it's two to two. 
[02:47:00]  Huh?  It's two to two.  Okay, your police tell your officers they just passed me.  Okay, they just passed you?  Yeah.  Go outside and flag them down, okay?  Okay, my mother-in-law just got here, too.  Okay.  Okay.  Alrighty.  Alrighty.  Bye-bye.  Dude was a cop.  Who scored the first goal for the Red Wings?  That's a nice question.  How did he know he was a cop?  I guess that's what outed later on in the story.  Was he fired?  He's so fired.  I think he got in trouble.  It was 2007 or something.  That was just a guy freaking out.  Isn't that weird, man?  He was freaking out. 
[02:47:30]  He's just like, I'm pretty sure we're dead.  Yeah, we're dead.  Time's going really slow right now.  Yeah, that's just a bad friggin', like, a bad trip.  Like, having a bad trip.  It's hard to get out of those, though.  Yeah, all he had to do was relax for a few minutes.  Just wait it out, sit it out.  You know what?  Grab a sandwich, buddy.  You need a moment of clarity long enough to just go, all right, look.  You're really fucked up.  And that's the quick one.  And the long one, she's like, do you have a gun in there?  Is there a weapon in the house?  And he's like, no.  And then later on, she asks again.  He goes, you already asked me that. 
[02:48:00]  No.  Wait, yes.  In the bedroom, there is one.  And that's, I guess, where it led to the cop thing.  Well, the thing that's weird is that he confiscated this.  If he had just bought it, he would know it's just pot.  But he's like, maybe they laced this with some...  That's what he was saying, but then he says it, too.  He goes, I think they put something in it.  I'm not sure.  Boy, is he in trouble.  Taking it from evidence.  Did you ever hallucinate when you used to take drugs, Jim, when you were a kid, or no?  Not really.  You weren't into heavy stuff.  He hallucinated when he drank, though.  Yes.  Walking down the street with a big knife.  But you never took heavy stuff.  No, nobody would trip with me. 
[02:48:30]  They all thought I'd have a bad trip.  You probably would.  Without it, you were going to get blown.  You'd be a bummer.  I would be.  You would be the bummer.  Mescaline, I kind of had a little thing.  I giggled a lot.  It was more booze.  There was a lot of laughing with mescaline.  What was mescaline like?  There are drugs that I've said more inches.  Mescaline's like acid light.  It scares me.  Mescaline was like acid light.  Well, I never did acid, but I was told it's like acid light because you don't really freak  out and everything's really funny on mescaline.  Yeah, I laughed a lot.  I think only when you're young, though.  I think because when you're young, everything's funny anyway. 
[02:49:00]  Right.  So if you took mescaline now, you might be thinking about your bills or something and freak out.  Drugs are absolutely wasted on the young.  Particularly weed.  Weed is really...  I mean, I'm so glad I didn't do a ton of weed when I was in high school.  Do you like weed?  Because now I can appreciate it like so much.  I heard a weed so much.  It's a lot stronger than it was like 20 years ago.  I guess.  Because you never smoked when you were a little kid.  I didn't really smoke that much.  I mean, I smoked like maybe you could count on two hands the amount of times I'd smoked  over the course of my life.  Dude, a bag of shake was like the shit when growing up and when I was going to school.  Like you get a bag of shake and you're like, hey, I got some weed.  You roll some joints, seeds all over the place. 
[02:49:30]  Now you're just like, there's a bud that you can smell from a mile away.  I know, yeah.  It smells fantastic.  There's like fucking Fortress of Solitude crystals growing out of it.  Yeah.  It's just...  I'm going to move this one and see my father.  Yeah, there it is.  He's been dead for years.  And you do.  Remember smoking a joint and you had a seed in there and it popped?  The popping seed.  Yeah.  That's great.  No seeds anymore.  No seeds.  Yeah, there's no such thing.  Yeah, we always had to clean the weed. 
[02:50:00]  Someone had to clean the weed.  Yeah, you get your big fucking Yes album.  Yeah.  Start fucking...  Like you're panning for gold.  You're spinning it around.  The seeds are flying all over your carpet.  You got to pick them up so mom don't find them.  Yeah, now you get this one giant bud.  It smells amazing.  Your fingers are like you were playing with crazy glue when you're done because of all  the resin coming out of it.  You just...  It's so...  It's like you live in my house.  Amazing.  Everything you're saying.  How often do you smoke pot?  Someone was living in my house that smoked a lot of pot. 
[02:50:30]  To be fair, I didn't start smoking until July 4th of not this last year, but the year  before, so that would be July 4th of 2008.  At that point, I don't think there's a day that's gone by where I haven't smoked a joint.  But back in the beginning, like July 4th this year, it was my weed birthday where  I was just like, wow, one full year and it's been amazing.  Your weed birthday.  Weed birthday where I was smoking one year straight.  And in the beginning, it was like I would be like, this is awesome.  I'm going to, you know, every day I'll get my work done. 
[02:51:00]  Seven o'clock at night, I'll kick back, smoke a joint, smoke half a joint, watch a movie  and stuff like that.  That went like that for like a month.  And then I was just like, yeah, but I ain't got nothing to do.  Why am I waiting until seven o'clock?  Let me dial it back.  Maybe it's to kick back around three, four o'clock or something like that.  And then a month later, I was just like, who am I kidding?  Wake and bake, motherfucker.  Wake and bake.  And it really, it improved everything.  I know I'm supposed to be like, yeah, I'm a loser and shit like that.  I've been doing the best work of my life.  So when you're directing, when you're on the set directing, you get hot? 
[02:51:30]  No, that's the only thing.  You can't do that to people you're working with.  But I work solo.  Like I write a lot.  Right.  If I'm writing or if I'm editing or if I'm in a room by myself doing something, I'm just  like, this is going to help me focus.  You don't look at the shit like after you're, when you're not stoned and go, what the hell  was I thinking?  I'm writing this Batman miniseries right now.  Batman, the widening jar is called.  And this year two just came out this week.  The, it was during that period where I started smoking a lot, where I moved into the wake  and bake territory.  And what I would do was I would smoke and I'd start writing and then I wouldn't so much black 
[02:52:00]  out, but maybe fall asleep, get disinterested, move on, whatever, step away from it.  But then the next time I stepped back to it, completely straight, I would read it and  be like, it's like elves wrote it in the night.  I don't remember any of this.  And it's really good.  I felt like the cobbler, you know, I was just like, this is amazing.  And I'm reading it going, this is the best shit I've ever written in comics.  And I would tweet some of the stuff.  Then you realize you just stole it from someone's blog? 
[02:52:30]  It was kind of pasted right from the web.  I cut and pasted like Batman Arkham Asylum by Grant Morrison.  I was like, I'm a genius.  It was good, dude.  That's helped.  And then like, you know, I have the podcasts I thought have been funnier for us for the  last year.  Like this podcast show.  Do you understand how bad what you're saying is?  I understand, dude.  No, I could give a flying fuck, but it's like, dude, smoking weed makes you more creative.  Well, that's always the musician, you know, like I gotta be, I gotta be fucked up to 
[02:53:00]  right.  Right.  Yeah.  And then when they get sober, like, is this shit going to be any good anymore?  But it's not even that.  For me, it's just like, I, that's nice, but I'll tell you what, what I find is beautiful  about it.  It just filters everything out.  Like I used to get so stressed about.  Takes the edge off.  Yeah.  Like shit.  Like I, dude, I would spend literal hours online arguing with people about my shit,  arguing with them.  Not about like, you better like it because that's subjective.  But when they were wrong about it or writing fucking untrue shit, I get out there and literally  just be like, you know, that's not true. 
[02:53:30]  Let's start a debate.  And sometimes it's fucking fun because it's so easy to, you know, fucking from on high  to pick off people that are selling, telling you you suck cock and they spell cock C.  You know what I'm saying?  Just run circles around them and shit.  But at the end of the day, how impressive is that?  Like I ran circles around a fucking 14 year old.  So all the hours I spent doing that, dude, once I started smoking weed, I was just like,  you know what?  We're entitled to their opinion.  And then I fucking move on.  And that's it.  It's like an equalizer. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, we'll take the highs down.  We'll take the bass down.  And also, I'm not a very social creature.  Like I get up on stage and I could do the crowd and shit like that.  But me and like, this is easy because I know there's an audience that's kind of being on  stage.  And I also like you guys and we're comfortable and shit.  Other places, like my wife's friends for the first like five years of our marriage, they  come over and I would just be like, hello, how are you?  Hey.  Keep my eyes down and shit.  You know, because I'm like, number one, good fences make good neighbors.  I don't know these chicks.  I don't want them being like, he looked at me, Jen.  Like, you know, that is always, I'm always concerned about that. 
[02:54:30]  But also, I just, dude, I grew up fat.  I don't fucking talk to chicks.  You know?  I grew up fat.  It's like, so basically I was always kind of, I wouldn't call myself an introvert by  any stretch of the imagination, but I was very, very quiet in small groups and I never  liked to leave the house.  And then I started smoking weed.  The first night we smoked weed together, I was like, let's call a cab, go out to fucking  eat, bitch.  And we went out and we went to this restaurant in the, it's the hotel, the Sofitel Hotel in  Los Angeles, right across the street from the Beverly Center. 
[02:55:00]  They got a restaurant called Simon LA and they got this platter, a dessert platter.  It's called Circus Circus, I think.  Oh shit.  And it starts with a massive bowl of cotton candy.  You'd wash it down with a thick ass chocolate shake.  It's got homemade hostess looking cupcakes, snowballs, cookies.  Oh, it's just nothing but sugar.  You eat until you're shitting on the chair.  Until you're shitting pink on the chair.  And then basically we sat down and I was like, we'll take three.  And we just like sat there feeding each other.  They've got these couches that you lay on and shit. 
[02:55:30]  I never, I don't go out, dude.  Like I never leave my house, but I was so fucking blitzed.  I was just like, you are the most amazing thing that ever happened to the history of mankind.  You know, just all into it.  It just, I like all of a sudden she was just like, oh my God, like I, I like this version  of Kevin.  Kevin's going to be on like the tabloid covers with his hand in the camera's face.  Exactly.  Because you've never seen Kevin out.  Like there's never a picture of him out somewhere.  But to be fair, Kevin Smith, here he is.  To be fair, we did that for like three days.  And then I was like, eh, let's just stay home and do it. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Like, why are we leaving?  People will bring stuff.  Get fucked up at home.  Yeah.  Watch TV.  It's weird though.  I hardly.  Go peepees.  We're going to take a break anyway.  Don't piss on the seat, dude.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  It's a splatter.  Jimmy, we're going to take a Jimmy's gotta make wee-wees break.  I can't believe he lasted this long.  Yeah, we've been going an hour.  No, but he lasted this long without pissing.  Oh, I know.  He's got a little hummingbird bladder.  Well, it's actually, um...  He's one of those chukar pants.  The doc was talking about. 
[02:56:30]  What do you got?  Nothing.  Oh.  Apparently.  Just wants to make sure nobody bad-mouthed me.  Oh.  I got your back when you got me.  Wait till we leave.  We'll wait till you leave and then...  I don't trust you.  You'll put some collar on.  No, I would never do that.  Dude, the conversation got so much better when he left the room.  Aw.  Jimmy, I mean, you're living sober or something.  I remember I asked him at the house.  I was like, dude, I was going to smoke a joint, but I felt like, you know, if somebody's sober,  I don't want to do it.  So I was like, you all right?  And he was like, well, I don't.  And so I didn't.  I wasn't mad if you did, though.  But I didn't want to do it in front of him. 
[02:57:00]  And I was just about to stop and go, Jimmy, you need to smoke some weed.  But I guess that's like, that time is gone, Kim.  It's tempting at moments, but most times it's not.  And I quit when I was 18.  18?  How long did you do it?  Two years.  You know you had to be a fucked up kid when you quit at 18.  Like, how do you make that decision at 18?  Because everyone is fucking out of their mind drunk at 18.  But how do you stop at 18, though?  You don't socially drink responsibly at 18.  And then I told Murray over in accounting.  Give me a Manhattan.  Straight up.  I went to meetings. 
[02:57:30]  Because let's just say I was, you know, you're on the phone with the FBI.  Yeah, Jimmy did things that normally 18-year-olds don't.  You would get stoned and call the FBI?  Drunk, yeah.  Really?  Because people were what?  Like, following you?  That was just crazy.  Did you read them some of that poetry you would write?  No, but I did write poetry.  I was the worst.  I remember we did that one day on the show.  Oh, you read my poem that I wrote when I was like, oh, oh, yeah.  That was so awesome.  It went in my book.  It was horrible.  Oh, that was terrible.  I've woken up on the, you know, the bathroom floor after a vomit fest after tequila shots. 
[02:58:00]  I see, I can't do booze.  I'm such a non-man.  I can't drink like that.  No, this was back, like, when I was 18 and shit like that.  That's the kind of stuff I would do where, you know, but it wasn't calling the FBI, but  everybody that just starts drinking at that age, 17, 18 years old, you constantly, you  don't drink because, wow, this is a fine bourbon.  You drink going, I am getting fucked up tonight.  I'm in the woods with my friends.  What are we having, cocktails?  That's true.  That cocktail. 
[02:58:30]  It's true.  It was all about the end results.  Yeah, it was just about getting fucked up.  Yeah, it was like, how quickly can we do it?  And really, in high school, there was always, like, the one person, and that was usually  me, who'd be like, look, if you really want to get fucked up quick, put it right in your  ass.  And that's when you find out how quickly people are like, no, I'll drink it.  What are you doing?  That guy's got a problem.  Yeah, because, yeah, you go wee-wee's, Jimmy.  I'm back.  We'll take a little break.  But to identify that there's a problem at 18 is really, like, something, because, like  I said, everyone's fucked up. 
[02:59:00]  Dude, you've got to let this man piss you.  No, but you know what it is?  I love doing this.  When you're walking down the street with a butcher knife because you're hoping the police  shoot you, you're like, yeah, that's not normal.  Yeah, that I never did.  Yeah.  And weren't you doing something, throwing stuff at people's cars or paint or something?  What were you doing?  You and your friends would stand in the corner?  Oh, when I would hang out with fucking Mike and Stanley.  We would fucking, they were, Stanley was like 25, Mike was 13, which is how old  I was.  You were hanging out with a 25-year-old?  They were brothers, though.  You were the little boy that hung out with adults.  Me and the one brother of the same age, and we would ride around, and they had, like, 
[02:59:30]  a truck, and they would have, like, fucking margarine containers of motor oil, and we  would fucking, like, dump it on people's dashboards and just pop their tires.  It was completely-  Pop the tires, too?  Yeah, and then dump it all over the dashboard.  And I remember one time, we were, like, fucking 98 degrees out, and we're driving in the  truck, and there's this hitchhiker walking backwards with no shirt, and fucking Mike looked  at his brother and goes, hey, Stanley, let's drive back and throw hot oil on him.  He wanted to just throw hot oil on the guy's chest. 
[03:00:00]  Because he wanted to get it out of the engine?  He wanted to drain oil out of the engine.  Like, real hot oil.  Yeah, like motor oil.  And he fucking threw it on the guy's chest.  Yeah, he was great.  God damn.  Let's throw hot oil on him.  Creeps.  How would you feel if you came out to your fucking car that you worked hard for, and some  little fucking cocksucker put oil on your dashboard?  My bad.  Yeah.  Dude, it's like you were raised in that movie, Over the Edge.  Remember that?  With a community, there's this movie, Over the Edge, where they create, like, a new cane,  and it's called, like, a community, a planned development community, and the kids are all 
[03:00:30]  restless and burn it down and lock the adults in the school and shit out.  Oh, you don't remember this movie, Matt?  No, I don't remember that.  Over the Edge.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Team Seminole attack film.  Attack film.  All right, go peepees.  We'll take a quick break, and we'll be right back.  Absolutely.  Hi.  Opie and Anthony show.  Opie was out sick today.  He's out sick.  He's got a sore throat. 
[03:01:00]  So, me, Jimmy, Danny has been a joy at the board, per usual.  Danny, always very good.  And I got Florentine in, and of course, Kevin Smith.  And I'm joined by my co-host, Jimmy Norton.  With a mouthful of pretzel.  Yes, you are.  Call it pretzel.  We call it cum.  You silly goose.  We were talking about porno, of course, during the commercial break.  It always goes to porno.  Where am I going to be this afternoon?  Do it.  This evening, I'm going to be at Barnes & Noble in Union Square for a signing. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, yeah, your book.  I'm signing a book.  The paperback, right?  If I don't say something about the signing, people get upset.  You know something?  I'm signing today.  I think it's at 7 o'clock, Barnes & Noble, Union Square.  Come on down and chit-chat for a while, and I think we're going to try to sign books.  See, that's what happens now if fans bring you weed.  Do you take it, or are you doing that?  I don't know.  I mean, what is the protocol?  Could that be?  If a cop gives you weed, no, cops really seem to like me in this city, man.  I will say that.  But NYPD are great. 
[03:02:00]  I may be acting like a teenager in as much as I'm enjoying weed, but I do have the sensibility  of a 39-year-old man, where I'm just like, perhaps I should keep this someplace where it's  not going to be viewed.  Well, because a lot of comics on the road, if any fans know that they do that stuff, that's  when they just come by and go, hey, I hear this for you, or you want to go smoke or whatever.  And comics always take them up.  They don't even think twice.  It happened to Opie at an appearance years ago.  We were doing a club in Massachusetts somewhere, and he comes out of the bathroom, guy shakes  his hand, and guy gives him weed, just gives him a bud in his hand, and I'm right next 
[03:02:30]  to him, and I'm talking to a group of guys that turned out to be troopers.  They were mass troopers.  And I just went, oh, and here's Opie, and his right hand, he's got weed in it, and then  the cops put out their hand to shake his hand.  And Opie kind of went like, and turned his left hand upside down, and shook it like that.  The awkward shake.  Because he just had a handful of fucking weed.  It's like, the motherfucker couldn't have picked the worst time to hand me weed. 
[03:03:00]  I don't know.  I mean, I guess, like, I certainly, I'm certainly very trusting of the fan base, but it's the  one non-fan that I think I would be like, somebody slips me a wet or something like that,  and I'm like, ah!  That's why, like, when people bring me an open beer or something, or a drink at a bar,  I'm like, you know, ah, roofie in here, wake up, you're fucking me in the ass.  I mean, even like when they hand you prepackaged shit, I'm just like, you'd rather be awake  for it.  Yeah. 
[03:03:30]  I'm asleep?  Come on.  But also, you know, a lot of comics do it because they don't want to travel with it.  They're afraid, so they figure if they go to the town, they'll get it there, so they don't  have to worry about going through security and everything.  That's a new part of my life, a new addition to my life, is like the hour or whatever it  is I spend every new city I go to going, okay, where am I going to secure?  Yeah.  Got to procure.  I've never had to worry about that before.  Just go places and then leave places.  Because you don't want to, like, what, go over state lines or travel?  Well, you're flying, I guess, yeah, obviously.  Yeah, you just don't want to fly with anyone like that.  Even in a car, too, it's a little...  Yeah, I mean...  You use the old... 
[03:04:00]  House, dude, I'm a house bug.  That's the German tactic in Russia.  We won't take supplies, we'll just get them as we go along, as we invade.  Yeah, we're positively...  So that's what you're doing with weed, and then you realize...  Positively Prussian.  I got nothing.  I can't get any weed.  They did the scorched earth policy and smoked it all on me.  Yeah, I never thought of that, though.  You smoke weed and you're fucking traveling around.  You're screwed.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of guys...  Some guys will take it, they'll put it between, you know, in their...  Between the balls and the ass.  They boof it.  They boof it.  They boof it. 
[03:04:30]  And go through...  Yeah, go through security instead of putting it in a bag.  I like smoking it from there.  Then they insert a straw along.  It's a little musty.  It's a good mushroomy flavor.  Little onions.  Little onion marijuana.  Yeah, it's great.  What are we talking about?  Let's go back to the point.  The porn stuff.  We were just talking about how years ago...  We did a whole bit off the air.  It was ridiculous.  It was really good, too.  Should have just turned the mic off.  Let's relive it.  Yeah, we'll relive it.  We'll pretend we didn't do it the first time.  We'll do the clip notes.  We were just talking about porn and basically how it's tough now to surf through some places 
[03:05:00]  like efuck.com or something like that.  Yeah.  They'll have lots of porn clips.  As always, they've had porn clips interspersed with horrendous death clips.  Yeah, I don't like the death shit.  The fucking...  Here's somebody cut in half.  Here's a woman who was thrown through the windshield and now she's got half a head or a guy that  was hit by a train and he's still alive, cut in half.  And meanwhile, it's sandwiched between the best blowjob footage you're ever going to  see.  I want to click on that, but I'm getting these little thumbnail views of carnage and I don't 
[03:05:30]  want my porno mixed with that kind of grotesque death shit because I really think that'll  fuck you up.  You're not looking for surf and turf.  You want a one dish only.  One.  That's it.  That stuff stays with you.  Like porn.  That which is seen can't be unseen.  Right.  You'd be surprised when I could...  But porno's fine, though.  Porno, I love.  I'll watch it.  I'll watch the blowjob footage.  The chick will get the cum right in her face.  It's great.  I move on.  Thank you.  And then I don't think about it.  The death shit, you go to bed and you're like, that motherfucker was like writhing around 
[03:06:00]  with his intestines out and he knew he was dying and it's like, Jesus Christ.  Fuck it.  It stays with you.  Jason Mewes saw, watched an execution online from Mewes and I was like, what was it like?  And he was like, don't watch it.  No.  Don't ever watch it because I'm sorry I watched it and I can't shake it.  Can't take it back.  And that dude never says shit like that.  Right.  You know, I would expect his response to be, it was fucking awesome.  He was just rattled and shaken to the core. 
[03:06:30]  And it was a long distance shot, too.  But still, he was just like, I was, I was, I was also saying how you get like this post  traumatic stress syndrome.  Why couldn't you get that from watching videos like that?  These horrible death videos, because some people just can't, some people can't take it.  You never watched face of death when you were a kid.  It was your pants around your ankles.  Yeah.  Just that monkey brain part.  I would just fucking unload right on that.  We didn't know it was fake back then though. 
[03:07:00]  Right.  I mean, I thought it was real.  I totally knew it was fake.  So fake.  It was?  So fake.  Why are you, why are you winking at me, Jimmy?  So fake.  It really was.  The whole thing was fake.  How'd you know?  How'd you know?  The only real stuff.  Because the guy admitted it after.  Michael Gross was not really a doctor.  He was played by an actor.  I'm a doctor.  Francis B. Gross.  The only real shit in that was the news footage.  Like they showed one of those plane crashes in San Diego where there were body parts on  rooftops and shit.  That was real.  What about the monkey in the table? 
[03:07:30]  Is that real?  Fake.  The lion attack.  Fake.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm stuck on the monkey in the table.  I saw them hammering its head.  No, you actually didn't.  Really?  You saw a spinning monkey.  I did.  Then you saw them hammering, but not the monkey's actual monkey head.  Punch it up.  We'll find it.  Why would they do that?  And then, because they wanted a shock in a maze.  Because they're dicks.  And people still bring it up now.  I mean, look, on one level, I'm delighted.  Because for years, that monkey haunted me.  I mean, that's why I smoke weed.  Because of that monkey.  That fucking little monkey.  That hurt me as a child. 
[03:08:00]  I was like, this poor monkey.  Why won't anyone save him?  No, it was so fake.  I don't want to hear that.  Dude, I believe for like the better part of 28 years that they killed and ate that monkey's  brain.  Everything was fake in that movie.  Really?  It's terrible.  Watch the alligator attack.  Alligator attack is fake.  They pan away from it.  It's so...  We watched it recently.  We were just laughing at how bad it was.  There's the monkey brain thing.  Monkey brains.  See the waiter?  That's actually Skip Stevenson.  What?  From real people?  Yeah.  All right.  Now they put the monkey in the middle of the table.  A little cage. 
[03:08:30]  And now they slide this little monkey thing to Griffith's head over there.  And look how unhappy he is.  He's terrified.  The monkey is not happy.  He's spinning around.  Oh, man.  And now they are supposed to take turns, I guess, bashing the monkey over the head until  his head cracks open.  Then they eat his brains.  Yeah, watch.  Here they go.  Now they...  See, he's instructing them how to crack the monkey's head open with the little thing.  And the monkey's spinning around.  He's doing little pirouettes.  And they've handed them all these little mallets.  And now they're ready. 
[03:09:00]  See?  Look.  Oh.  See?  Oh, look at this clever direction.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  See?  Not even...  And it never even occurred to me as a child.  How fake is that?  Rewind.  If you...  That's actually the...  Why would faces of death cut away from garbage?  Rewind a little bit.  Yeah, exactly.  Rewind a little bit.  Watch how fake this one guy next to us his arm is.  Watch.  Yeah, when he goes for the hit and he pulls back.  Watch.  He blinks hard while he does it.  How fucking fake is that?  I don't like that. 
[03:09:30]  It's fucking professional wrestling.  When did they get to the brains?  Even when they cut back to the monkey, there was no marks on him.  They already hit it 17 times.  No.  He was fine, the little guy.  Now it's a total fake monkey head.  Rubber.  Little rubber monkey head.  Look at how rubbery that is.  There's fucking...  There's no blood.  And wouldn't his...  Yeah.  His nose would be bleeding.  He'd have a little monkey nose bleed.  He'd be all fucked up.  Go to the alligator attack, too.  That might be a real monkey, but a dead one.  Go to the alligator attack.  Go to the alligator attack.  It's so fake, because they cut away from the actual attack when it happens, and they just 
[03:10:00]  show, like, pandemonium.  There's something happening, and you don't know what.  Pandemonium.  Yeah, and there's a lion attack, which is the same thing.  This makes me reevaluate everything.  Everything you've ever known.  I don't even know if I like girls anymore.  Everything I believed about myself to be true is now in question.  Well, what age did you think pro wrestling was...  Did you find that it was fake?  What?  I thought it was real until I was, like, 14, and then when I found that it wasn't, I was  really fucking...  I was really annoyed, and I stopped watching it.  I was angry. 
[03:10:30]  That was one of those movies as a kid that I picked up on pretty early.  You did?  I did.  Sam Holland, my friend Sam Holland loved it, and so did Ernie O'Donnell, and I remember  watching it being like...  You know what happened?  This is clearly...  They're playing archetypes here, right?  At age 11, you say archetype, and they're like, get out of here, faggot.  I'm like, I mean, these bad guys.  It was all plausible deniability they had.  It was like, all right, we'll say it's real, and no matter what you see, no matter how  bad it looks, we're still going to tell you it's fucking real.  Right.  And you'd be like, well, they're saying it's real. 
[03:11:00]  They couldn't do that.  I was fucking nine or ten.  Of course I believed it.  They said it was real.  I believed them.  And it looked real.  What is it?  We're looking for an alligator attack?  No, Dan, this is outdoors.  Wait, let me see.  Go back.  I'm sorry.  Let me see.  I don't know what that is.  Just turn it towards me.  I got to tell you, I'm really happy, though, that that monkey...  Yeah, that monkey's fine.  He's probably dead now, though.  I don't know how old monkeys are, how long they last.  But I hope he got a lot of residual checks for that play.  Sitting at his house.  That was me, spinning around.  You know how many takes I took?  Jesus Christ. 
[03:11:30]  Director was a pain in the ass.  What they had was a device under me that would spin me around, and you didn't see that.  I was getting pulled by ropes either way, but...  This was before fucking green screen, too, my friend.  I liked how they had a two-camera shoot for that monkey scene.  They had one inside and then one out.  One below the table, and then one on the reaction shot for the woman that was  disgusted.  She put the napkin up to her face like, oh, they didn't tell her you're coming here  to clobber a monkey and eat its brains?  I didn't know this would happen.  Oh, my God.  I thought we were having pasta.  You can't find it, Dan? 
[03:12:00]  Oh, well.  What's your...  Where is your favorite porn now?  I go to a site called Submit Your Ex.  Submit Your Ex.  Oh, I like that.  You know, that...  It's one of those...  Well, it's a quasi-revenge porn site.  They write a lot of...  They do all the write-ups for them, and it's like, supposedly, the people sent them in  are just like, this is Rachel.  She broke my heart, so fuck her.  You know, a lot of shit like that.  But a lot of it, I believe, is just homemade, you know.  I love something.  Is it any real porn chicks, you think? 
[03:12:30]  Ah, it could be, but I mean, now it's like there's a mixture out there of true, like,  you know, amateur or home camera, camera phone shit.  Yeah.  And now the porn industry is trying to duplicate it, so you'll find shit where you're just  like, well, this feels quasi-real, but it's not very real.  You can totally tell.  Like, I like...  The videos where the chick is just going like, hi, Philly, this is just for you.  You told me you wanted to see me straight...  And there she goes.  She's obviously in her room.  It's like a bedroom with the fucking little stuffed animals and shit. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, teddy bear on a bed.  You just know it's...  Like, they don't dress a set like that in a porno.  It's too perfect.  Right.  It's girl's room.  And there she is just unloading these great tits and fucking...  This is the real one you're talking about.  Yeah.  That's how you know the real one.  Yeah.  And then they're like, okay, bye.  Click.  They're really fast.  They're short.  They're quick.  And that guy must have got it and been like, this is great.  And then the breakup comes.  Fucking bitches going all over the internet.  That's the only lesson I'm trying to impart to my child. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, boy.  I mean, Chris Rock always talked about keep her off the pole.  Keep her off the pole, yep.  That's not it.  Now it's just like...  Keep her off the net.  Keep her off the fucking net.  Don't take pictures, man.  That doesn't go away.  Yeah.  Or if you take the pictures, you hold the pictures.  Every digital version of it, it's your camera.  He can look at them while you're there.  Even men.  Treat it like the Declaration of Independence, where it's like somebody out and you go into  a room, it's set on a desk, and you look out and analyze it while somebody oversees you.  Someone goes to grab it and falls down a chute to a vault.  Or no head in the picture. 
[03:14:00]  That's the key.  That's true.  A body shot.  Look at Rob Lowe back in the day.  Freaking prancing around.  Didn't even give a shit.  There you go.  But there's lots of that on that site, man, where you're just kind of like, I don't know  if this is real or not.  But they look very natural.  You can tell by the camera work sometimes if it's too professional or if they have an  angle that they shouldn't have.  Yeah, that's true, too.  There's no way there should be that fucking across-the-room angle.  So one camera shoots you.  I hate when you're in the middle of it and you're in the middle of jerking off and then  you're like, oh, this is fake.  I gotta stop this and I gotta go to another clip.  And it makes a big difference.  Yes, it does. 
[03:14:30]  It really does.  Authentic is just more exciting because you're like, I'm not supposed to be seeing this.  When this was made, they were not thinking of me.  It was personal.  Yeah, this was like these two people.  They were in love.  And actually, when you look at it, it's not the mechanics of watching two people fuck because  it's like we've all seen that.  What I'm into in those clips is I'm looking at the room.  I'm like, what kind of poster are they got?  Yeah, yeah.  What are they reading over there?  How come they haven't changed it?  Look at that blanket.  It has a Coors logo on it.  It looks like Circa 79 and they still have it on their bed. 
[03:15:00]  Maybe they had a sponsor.  There was one picture because I look at a lot and there was one picture I found of a chick  and it was a, you know, homemade porn shot and she's sitting there like pulling up her  shirt and pulling her shorts to the side and showing it in the background, hanging on  the wall, mall rats poster.  Really?  I was like, the best of both worlds for me.  That's great.  I saw this girl and she was in a college dorm room, obviously, you know, she's, she's 
[03:15:30]  masturbating with a hairbrush.  As you do.  It's fantastic.  So she's just going at it and girl next door kind of look, which is great.  I hate the fucking porn star, bubble headed blonde, big fake titted thing.  Right.  It's all turned around.  It's gone back to a common man.  Yeah.  Regular girls rule.  So, uh, and then I look behind her, she's got like a bulletin board and there is, uh,  an address and a phone number and pictures of what I can only imagine are her family. 
[03:16:00]  Wow.  Like behind her.  It's like, dude, I've seen, I've seen images like that too.  What are you doing?  We're seeing too much in their private life.  Look at, look at your shot.  Unless you got a real short depth of field where, you know, I had no idea how crisp I  can focus on this.  Terrible.  I try to look at it real close.  You know what?  I would jerk off to the mom too.  Let me zoom in on this.  I was telling, I was telling him before that, uh, there was a picture I found the other night 
[03:16:30]  where, uh, you know, submit, submit your ex.  There's a site called submit your mom, which is like cougars and milfs.  So, wow, and then submit your flicks, which is, I already wrote them down.  There you go.  Totally free.  Once again, a free site.  And you'll, they'll run like 20 minute clips.  You can watch a whole movie and shit.  Grab popcorn.  It's amazing.  Cause you used to have to fucking pay through the nose with fucking, uh, for, uh, memberships  and this.  And, and maybe you'd get a still picture thumbnail.  It would be all they'd give you.  Yeah.  You couldn't even blow the picture up.  It wouldn't even get up. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  It would be all pixelate.  You see one pixel is a vagina and everyone has an amazing camera now.  So they're taking pictures that are 120, you know,  megapixels or whatever like that.  Really.  And, and you know, the, you see the image on the page and it's small.  And if you roll in your, run your cursor over it, you see that it can, yes.  And when you see that magnifying glass, you sit there going, okay, here we go.  Let's see how deep we're going.  And you give it the click.  And sometimes it just pops a little bit and you're like, oh, but sometimes dude, it just 
[03:17:30]  fucking, you are in the room all of a sudden.  It goes so wide.  You're surrounded by this image and you're in it.  It's like when Harry Potter puts his face in the pensive.  Suddenly you're in that moment where they took that picture.  And in this picture, there's a chick.  She's like, I would say 42 or something like that.  Thin body and stuff.  But you know, time's taking us toll or whatever.  Still looks way better than me.  She's spreading her ass and laying over the bed, looking over her shoulder.  And that's the shot.  When you click on it, it goes so hyper large that you're looking at her ring piece, the 
[03:18:00]  brown eye, as if it's the size of a normal human eye.  When you can blow the picture up to like one equals one, where you're sitting, you're looking  at an ass on a computer screen and a man's hand is on the ass and you match your hand  to the man's hand, you're like, we are now at one per one proportion.  So I'm looking at that and all of a sudden I look closely and I'm like, oh, you know,  you get the ring piece, the asshole, little grooves, of course, you're supposed to get  in there and clean the grooves.  She did not.  Oh, no. 
[03:18:30]  Little, like fecal remnants.  Really?  Flex.  I was so amazed because I was like, this is awesome.  This is so human.  It's real.  Nobody cleaned.  Nobody was like, hold on, we got to clean the shit off your ass.  This dude taking a picture, either he didn't know or he didn't care.  He's like, this is so fucking dirty.  And boom, snapped it.  And then I was alone in my room smoking a joint, staring at this woman's unclean asshole.  And I was just like, I love the internet.  This is amazing, man.  Like, I don't have to leave the room and I'm interacting.  That's like a great religious testimonial. 
[03:19:00]  If you're like, how did you find God?  And the story starts off like that.  Are you a fan of that, Jim?  A little fecal matter in there?  I prefer it to be.  I don't mind a little bit of the smell.  But I don't want to see like shit in there.  But if it smells a little bit, like it's a little sweaty in there.  It's like, eh.  A little sweaty.  Yeah.  Or it's dirty.  A little dirty is good.  Do you find your ass smells like a chick's ass?  Same difference?  Like sometimes you're in a chick's ass and you're just like, oh, that smell.  And then every once in a while, like you're sweating, rub your ass crack or something.  You're like, that smells like a chick's ass.  Apparently, my dick is so small, I'm hung like a fucking broad. 
[03:19:30]  So my ass smells like my pussy or something like that.  Your ass thinks you're a girl.  I never saw a dick swinging past me.  My ass is like, you know, reading my body, mass index going, he's got boobs, must be  a girl.  Sweat like a girl through the ass.  Oh, God damn.  That picture was astounding, man.  I'm still thinking about that picture.  You got to know where you are.  That's my next lesson for the kid.  If you're going to do it, wipe.  Clean up.  Yeah, big time.  Baby wipe.  You don't want people fucking getting all freaked out or excited about this. 
[03:20:00]  I saw a clip, do you ever, Bang Bus, we've all heard of.  Yeah, sure.  And that's, is that fake, you think, or real?  Has to be their adult.  Yeah, I think that's fake.  There's no way they can just film you without IDing you first and then put you on the internet.  It's completely illegal.  Unless they get your permission later on.  Like, they could do that whole thing and then afterwards be like.  Like candid camera?  Sure.  Yeah, totally.  Hey, it's Alan Trunk.  They had one.  She's sucking my cock.  Here she is.  I'm going to fuck Fanny Flag in the ass.  My four yams the damn looks on.  They have one I saw called Bait Bus. 
[03:20:30]  And what it was, was a chick, hot chick, gets the guy in.  You know, they put a fucking blindfold on him and shit like that.  And she's like, I'm going to suck your dick so good.  And he's like, yeah, do it, baby.  She goes down him and shit.  Backs away.  The guy, the dude who was posing as the sound man, the guy, slips over and starts sucking the dude's cock.  And the chick is like calling up to the dude going, oh, it's so good and stuff, while the dude stops.  And he's like, oh, I love it.  I love it and shit.  Goes on for a few seconds.  And they're like, take the blindfold off. 
[03:21:00]  He takes it off and sees the dude sucking his dick.  And he freaks.  But he doesn't like try to punch anybody.  That's why I thought it was fake.  Because a dude like, the way he was portrayed, he was so testosterone addled.  Like, if that happened to me, I'd be like, why'd you do that to me?  Yeah.  A dude like this would shoot you in the fucking head.  Would fucking kill you.  Totally.  Trying to make me gay.  Yeah, what are you fucking up?  You know, he's like the dude in American Beauty at the end.  Like, he goes to kiss him and then suddenly shoots him in the fucking face.  But how many times, I mean, it's always like a hot chick walking in the middle of a neighborhood by herself.  I've never seen that ever. 
[03:21:30]  She is.  All right, let's grab her.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  A creepy bus just going like five miles an hour.  You don't think the chick's going to run?  Yeah, no doubt.  Hi, you want to come for a ride?  Okay.  Okay.  Where are you going?  Who are the Negroes?  Okay.  Who are the Negroes?  That never happens.  I do watch a lot of, like, store surveillance video.  I like that shit.  Like, I don't like...  Like the ones where people come in and punch a motherfucker in the face?  That's so scary.  And I don't mind, like, watching store owners shoot, like, the guys that are coming in to rob them. 
[03:22:00]  I've never seen those.  I don't mind.  Oh, yeah.  You guys are introducing me on me.  This motherfucker's like, here's a jump from space.  And then they're like, here's the fake version of monkey death.  And now you're telling me there's these videos?  If you go to some of these sites and just put, uh, uh, convenience store surveillance in the search, you'll see a shitload of these shootouts and stuff that happen.  I love when the fucking dummy comes in there to rob the place, fucks up, and the store owner just either blasts him or takes a bat to his head.  I saw one guy, he got hit over the head with a bat six fucking times, didn't go down. 
[03:22:30]  Wow.  And the guy, he had been robbed so many times by the same guy, by the way, comes in with this snorkel jacket pulled all the way up and goes to rob him.  The guy instantly sees him, opens the register.  Like, he knows he's coming in.  He's like, here he is.  Opens the register.  The guy comes to the register.  He doesn't show a weapon.  The guy grabs a bat from underneath the, uh, counter.  Who, the robber?  No, the, uh, the store owner.  And just starts pummeling this guy.  Also, he hit a button that locks the fucking doors. 
[03:23:00]  Just so he can beat the fuck out of this guy.  No, this is actually, this is my favorite one I've ever seen.  Yeah, I like this one, too.  It's a, it's a guy who tries to break into her liquor store by climbing up onto the roof and then getting into her up top.  And, uh, he doesn't do very well.  Yeah, this is a, this is a fun one.  There he is.  He's, uh, he's climbing up.  Because usually, I mean, come on, they're on drugs trying to.  And it's great because there's two cams, so you see him actually come up to the joint and then it switches to the inside the store cam.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's, uh, oh, he fell, he fell off the ladder there.  Oh, that's a big fall, man. 
[03:23:30]  He fell off the ladder.  He's really working for this.  Now there's a little piece of fence to get him up on the roof.  Now he's up on the roof.  Wait for it.  Now he's in.  And, uh, he's got to come through the hung ceiling into the liquor store.  Oh, boy.  Ceiling tiles are falling.  Um, he's, you can't walk on those like you can in Die Hard.  Uh, and, uh, oh, shit.  He just came smashing down onto the floor.  He is so hurt. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, wow.  Bottles are falling on his head.  He's a fucking hurting Johnny.  Oh.  Hey, God, I'll be at the floor.  He's still trying.  He's still trying.  So he walks around the store now a little bit.  Um, I got, he's got a shopping cart.  How do you not love this guy?  All I know is that dude's wearing almost my same outfit.  I wonder if he has a, he's wearing long jeans.  I wonder if he has a, I wonder if he has a, I wonder if he has a, I wonder if he has a  list with him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We need this.  Cigarettes.  So, man, he grabbed the smokes first. 
[03:24:30]  He's going around the joint.  Now he's, now he's got to figure out how to get out.  Uh, so he figures he's going to break the, the front door, uh, window on the front door.  But, man, this stuff is tough.  Wow.  It's got some kind of bulletproof glass on there.  He's, he's throwing.  Now he's using it as a crowbar.  He's using it as a crowbar.  Uh, through it.  Now he's trying to pry it over with that.  He's using it as a crowbar.  I see a keg out there.  Now he decides, fuck this.  I'm taking the ladder.  I'm going back up the way I came in.  Now he's just trying to escape.  Now he's just trying to get the fuck out of here. 
[03:25:00]  So he's not taking anything.  So he's on the, this is not a step step of the ladder.  You know, where you're not supposed to be.  So he's not even carrying loot with him at this point.  No, no.  Oh, no.  And the ladder now fell.  And he falls right on top of all the liquor.  He just fell on a top shelf.  Oh, this guy.  Oh, my God.  This guy couldn't fuck up robbing a place more.  But he's, uh, he's back for more.  Now he's trying to get the camera.  Because he knows that the camera's looking at him. 
[03:25:30]  And he realizes he's just going to sit on the keg at the front door.  And the police are there.  Smoke a cigarette until the cops show up.  And they did.  Because he was done.  That is genius.  And there's our fucking genius friend.  He didn't even open the door for the cops.  He just laid down.  No, no.  He sat down, smoked a cigarette.  That was just him going, ah, fuck it.  That guy is the fucking greatest.  That's the best.  What an ass.  I like how he found the ladder, though.  He's probably like, all right.  At least I can get out of here.  The best part, I think, is like, because he had it all planned out in his head. 
[03:26:00]  He's like, all right.  He knew exactly what place he wanted.  He must have cased the joint because he knew how to get in.  The air conditioning system, right?  In his head, this was all going to work so perfect.  He's like, all right, I'm going to get up on the roof.  I got the ladder.  I'm going to go down.  He should have known.  And he fell off onto the street the first time that it wasn't going to go well.  That couldn't have gone worse.  Besides blunt head trauma, there's no possible way that could have went worse for that potential robber.  Hysterical.  I love those.  I love watching those kind of surveillance videos. 
[03:26:30]  I've seen clips of the dude who'll be at the register and a person comes in and just fucking rocks him in the head.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, pounds a guy.  Where you feel it watching it and you're just like, oh, my God.  Where's the fucking baseball bat one?  I watched so many of them last night.  I kind of got there through another site.  Yes, I know.  Although I found a few sites last night that were, wow, hardcore fucking black militant sites  where they are saying on these sites that when blacks do black on white crime, 
[03:27:00]  whether it's something as simply as a robbery or murder, it is just a protest crime until they get reparations.  That's what this site was based on.  Wow.  Because no matter what black on white crime is done, it's totally cool.  It's fine.  Do it.  Run from the police.  Shoot police.  Just this site was amazing. 
[03:27:30]  And then they're saying everything that was done.  And this one guy walked into a restaurant and killed a woman.  Just killed this white woman that was working there.  And he claimed that it was a protest that he was doing.  Not a crime.  He was protesting the lack of reparations for slavery.  And this site just totally out of it.  But then I go to like Stormfront.  You know, I check them out.  Stormfront's that white supremacist group.  I was going to say, it sounds like the web is just where.  I've never ventured into the hate-filled parts of the web. 
[03:28:00]  Other than the any cool news talkbacks.  Hate sites are great.  They're funny as shit to read the comments.  I've been to the Fred Phelps site.  The God Hates Back.  I just watched the documentary.  The Westboro Baptist Church.  Which doc?  Which doc?  It was called, um, oh fuck, I don't remember.  It was, but you really do hope a driver just drives up and kills every one of the men, women, and child.  And they're just fucking horrendous people.  Oh, I know, yeah.  They're horrible.  I root for a guy just to plow through and kill them.  The, um.  I'm just not even sure if they believe it anymore. 
[03:28:30]  It just sounds like they're so caught up with it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It just sounds like now kind of a.  But the old man seems like he's out of commission.  He hasn't been seen in a little bit.  Well, to me, they sound like they're reacting.  Because I think he, from one of the, his kids that were estranged, there was four of them that left the cult.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, left.  And a couple of them said.  You don't like to talk about them.  Well, of course not.  And, you know, Shirley.  Malcolm, you know Malcolm, that dude who was here with me last time, Big Malcolm?  Yes.  Malcolm made a, I say Big Malcolm, I'm bigger than Malcolm, but Malcolm.  Gay Malcolm.  Yes.  Malcolm made a documentary called Small Town Gay Bar where we sat down and interviewed Phelps for two hours. 
[03:29:00]  And Malcolm never said that, hey, I'm gay.  But he also didn't really hide it.  But so he has two hours uncut, unexpurgated footage that I've seen what he has in the movie.  And what he kept in the movie was really cool.  But I watched the uncut thing.  And so Malcolm's talking to Fred Phelps.  And he comes off like your grandfather.  Yeah.  Like your racist grandfather.  And he's talking about family and all his daughters and son-in-laws and grandchildren that work in the church.  And Malcolm's like, but now you had a son and a daughter who don't, who've kind of left the church. 
[03:29:30]  And you watch Phelps go quiet for like 15 seconds.  And then he kind of leans forward with a very patific smile.  And he goes, we won't be talking about that, brother Malcolm.  Leans back and shit.  And apparently his family, like there were four, as you said, those kids who were just like, they're batshit.  Four of them left.  And there was one, Shirley Roper Phelps.  She's the one who's now the face of the organization. 
[03:30:00]  She had a kid out of wedlock.  And in this documentary.  Oh, are you kidding?  Yeah, she had her first, I think her son, Sam.  Is it the Louis Thoreau documentary?  Was it a British dude talking to him or no?  Yes.  In glasses?  Yes.  Louis Thoreau.  The British guy, although the fucking.  Freddie Laker?  The guy didn't make, the British guy making the documentary, it's not the guy who made the documentary, but they showed clips of this British guy.  And the Phelps has had these people over and they were debating them.  And he just was talking to Shirley Roper Phelps and a kid walked in and she said, are you the bastard? 
[03:30:30]  And the guy, it was an adult male, stopped.  I've never seen those people silence play anything.  He stopped and he goes, are you the illegitimate son?  Are you the bastard?  And she's like, I'm the mother, you can ask me.  And he's like, ah, and she actually stepped in front of her adult son and said, I'm the mother, you can ask me.  Oh, that's fantastic.  I've never seen those people stopped in their tracks.  And then in the next fucking clip, this British guy goes to talk to her brother, you know, one of the Phelpses. 
[03:31:00]  Wait, is it Keith Allen?  There's two, there's two British journalists wanting to spend time with them.  One was Louis Thoreau and one was Keith Allen, who's like Lily Allen's dad, the singer's dad.  I think it might be.  He's a shorter dude, kind of bald.  That's called, yes, Keith Allen.  That's Keith Allen.  And it's called Keith Allen's Going to Hell.  Yes, that was the clip from YouTube.  I saw that on YouTube, not in the documentary.  I'm sorry.  I saw this on YouTube.  And then he goes and talks to the Phelps brother, who's Fred Phelps' son, and the guy wiped the floor with Keith Allen.  Yeah, very much so.  Because Keith Allen was arrogant, you know, British arrogant shit. 
[03:31:30]  And even though the fucking Phelpses are wrong, and they're fucking assholes, they're tough to argue with.  They're lawyers.  It's a family of lawyers.  So they're prepared.  And that's how they make their money.  And that's what they don't really talk about, is they make their money through nuisance lawsuits and suing city governments that stop them from protesting.  That's how they fuel the coffers of the church.  Fred Phelps was disbarred.  He was a lawyer.  He was a lawyer as well.  But the family's full of lawyers.  He can't practice where they are.  Pricks, man.  But the one guy was arguing, and again, he was just, this British guy was just, just got the floor wiped with him. 
[03:32:00]  Because he didn't think this hick from Kansas was going to be able to smash him.  Really?  It's like, look, the guy is, I think, a religious nut.  I think he's a fanatic.  But it doesn't mean he's dumb.  But he was talking to the son-in-law?  If I remember correctly, that's the scene where they're like, where the signs are and shit.  Yes.  That dude, is that the dude who's not even related to them?  Like, he came, there was a dude who married into the church who came to do an expose on them.  And then he just fell in love with the Phelps and decided to stay.  And he married into it.  And he went from being a guy who's like, I'm going to fucking expose this bullshit to being a guy who was just like. 
[03:32:30]  Wow, they hypnotized him.  They brought him in.  And he's just like, he's in the Keith Allen one or the Justin Theroux one.  Or the Louis Theroux one, I mean.  But he talks at great lengths about like, yeah, I came here as a visitor just like you.  I guess what they say makes a lot of sense.  Yeah.  Wow.  They're really, Westboro Baptist Church, people who know the Arani interviews.  Because Ryan Fez, he interviews Shirley all the time.  But he doesn't call her out.  He just lets her sing.  He's really smart because he's different than anybody else does. 
[03:33:00]  It's a whole different angle.  Anybody else would be like, listen, you piece of shit.  You fucking should die.  And he's just like, oh, that's nice.  That's a nice song that you're doing.  So the fags.  How many of the fags do you want to get?  He just lets it go.  He doesn't allow his personal feel.  He's really funny and smart.  Oh, he wants to like, you know, he just wants to choke her.  Yeah, she's comedy gold, man.  Yeah, she's just going to, yeah, she's going to actually be funny.  You're going to laugh at her.  They protest soldiers' funerals.  That's what they do.  That's what they do.  God loves dead soldiers. 
[03:33:30]  And her song is like, God hates America.  It's a terrible song.  Of course it is.  It's not even in the top 10,000 on the Billboard charts.  They brought up something in the paper the other day that I was reading that apparently  the press has completely gotten off the, we want to show the bodies coming back from  Iraq and Afghanistan.  The press has just stopped even wanting to tape those and take pictures and publish them.  Don't you know why? 
[03:34:00]  That's because nobody's dying over there anymore.  Is that what it is?  We won.  All right.  I knew there had to be a reason.  When did that, and when did that quietly go away?  When George Bush went away.  Yeah.  Because it was very, it was a great way to get at George Bush.  It's like, well, they're saying that we can't have the media here and we can't take, we  want to show the American people the truth of what's going on, that people are dying.  And then George Bush is out.  Obama's in.  There's still wars going on.  People are still dying.  But the press now doesn't even care. 
[03:34:30]  They don't, they're not even there when the planes come in to try to get pictures or  video of, of the bodies.  It's such a hypocritical fucking elitist.  It is, but fuck him.  He was a terrible president.  Oh, I agree.  You know what I'm saying?  It's just like, I feel what you're saying.  It's like, hey, we should treat Obama the same way.  But this dude just started.  Or George Bush, believe me.  I know, I understand.  But this dude just started the job and he's like, you know, we're all kind of hoping he  does a great job.  Let's not, he's already got so many things to deal with. 
[03:35:00]  Or do we really need to throw one more thing on his shoulders?  The other guy, we were trying to get out.  You know, we were trying to hush, or what is it called?  Hasten his exit, if you will.  Yeah, but in this case with Obama, it's more, I mean, obviously the media is much more on his  side.  Of course, but also it's only fair to, it wasn't Obama's war.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, this dude started a war, so you show the results of his war on his watch.  Because if you show the dead soldiers on Obama's watch, people go like, well, why aren't you 
[03:35:30]  doing something about this?  The Iraq war, I agree with.  The Iraq war, fine.  But Afghanistan now is seeing more fatalities than ever.  And still, I mean, that's a war that was a just war.  That was Al-Qaeda, you know, they were responsible for the training.  Those four guys who just got busted were Afghanis, too.  Yeah, yeah, Afghanis.  I mean, it's...  Oh, yeah, of course.  The ones that came to New York.  Yeah, the terror plot they were trying to get...  Yeah, I was just reading about that in the time.  The guy's buying a shitload of fucking nail polish remover.  It's like, I know a lot of girls.  And they bought that.  Ta-da! 
[03:36:00]  And the woman was the checkout woman at the counter.  Yeah.  What woman buys that?  Like, I know a lot of girls.  Yeah, with that beard and with no...  He looked like he's Amish with a tan.  He's not going out with a lot of girls.  I don't care if he had no beard and a 12-inch cop.  Like, nobody believes a guy going, I know a lot of girls.  If he was buying that much bottled water, it would be a red flag.  I think he figured out a way to make water explode.  How much was he buying?  He bought it in an unseemly amount.  Like, they show him pushing a shopping cart full of it.  And it's a product that you use one can of every eight months or something like that. 
[03:36:30]  And then he went back the next month and got some more.  Is that what raised the red flag?  One of them.  There were a few things.  They should have had a bunch of guys.  Originally, he traveled to Pakistan.  And that's why they started watching him.  He was there for like a month.  And they started watching him.  And then when he came back, that's when he started buying all the stuff.  There's a front page piece in the Times today, which talks about how they had a scary moment where they've been gathering evidence.  They had to kind of bring it together very quickly because suddenly he was moving toward New York.  And nobody knew what the plan was.  But they knew there was something in the offing. 
[03:37:00]  And so they started moving in closer and collecting closer and collecting all the information they can.  The piece in the Times talks about like, well, they're not saying was it collected too fast?  They don't think it's going to hurt the case at all.  But they're saying like by nature, by the nature of this and by the nature of terror crimes, they can't go about it the same way anymore.  We're just like, you know, let's take our time and collect evidence.  Like they're collecting pieces of information and then they have to swoop and then get as much as they can and try to prosecute.  Because you don't want them going through with their plan.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:37:30]  Otherwise, and they say in the article, there was a moment where they were like they had they were a very tense moment where they had to decide whether or not to let him get on the flight from New York to Denver.  Because they're like, we know he has a plan.  What is he?  We don't know what it is.  We need to case him still, but we don't want him.  So they had like 12 FBI agents all over the plane as passengers and whatnot.  They covered that dude from head to toe through security.  I mean, and he knew he was being cased at that point.  The imam, I guess, had told him like, hey, you're being watched.  Could you see if all he wanted to do was like grab a bunch of cotton balls and just wipe women's toenail polish off? 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, maybe that was his fetish or something.  He's just running by with a bunch of nail polish.  Or that's his terror plot.  He's like, if you do that, then they'll weaken.  He's known as the Tootsie Kid.  He just gets hookers for that.  I want to remove your nail polish.  This little piggy went to the market.  Wonderful.  It would be more like, this little Jew Zionist went to the market.  Yeah, it's a weird place we're at now with that, especially when you have something like a terror plot. 
[03:38:30]  Because now they're saying, well, there are other people that they're looking for.  So, obviously, they probably wanted to follow this guy and get more info so they could have rounded him all up at once.  But now what?  Are these other guys kind of wandering around buying nail polish remover?  Well, they also, Obama was in New York City, too, so they were afraid that he was going to do something with him here.  And also, what was good is they actually did go through his computer, which they could have with Moussaoui back before 9-11. 
[03:39:00]  They weren't allowed to.  So, he left his car in the street.  They went in there, went through his computer, threw it back.  And then he realized someone messed with his computer.  And they found a bunch of bomb-making devices that he downloaded, a bunch of different sites he went to.  I'm sure the ACLU will be all over that.  Oh, what are they doing looking at his private computer stuff?  I'm all for, like, look, this guy.  It's a real test of the justice system.  Let's look at it.  This is the war on terror because they don't behave the way most criminals behave. 
[03:39:30]  It's not a crime.  There's no civility to it.  Like, even in your worst criminal offenders, you know, that aren't terrorists, rapists, killers, there's a bizarre civility to the whole process where it's a game of sorts.  We're like, okay, you got me.  Now you've got to prove I did it.  I'll pretend I didn't do it.  Very civil.  And, you know, you have to dot your fucking I's and cross your T's and shit like that.  This, you can't do that.  You can't afford to do it anymore.  I'm sorry.  Like, now people have to move on half and quarter information because if you don't, who knows what fucking happens. 
[03:40:00]  And aside from serial killers, you usually don't get the opportunity with other criminals to collect information before the crime is perpetrated.  You know, it's very hard.  Because it's a conspiracy.  So it is easier to catch these out.  It's not an act of passion or crime of passion.  They've been working on it for weeks, months, years.  And thank God it usually does leave a huge paper trail or too many people know.  I don't know where he went.  I guess in Denver is where he rented the hotel room where he cooked up the ingredients.  And they said they were able to go into the exhaust system and pull off layers of whatever the fumes. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, the residue with a chemical.  Wow.  Right in there.  I was like, I've got to start smoking weed outside.  They'll come into my house and be like, we found a mess.  Imagine if they go through Kevin's computer.  Like, why are you on submityourx.com?  Why were you looking at fecal matter at a one by one?  Why were you staring at it?  Clearly you're moving mass quantities of marijuana back and forth because this thing reeks.  But you're not a terrorist, so that's fine.  You're free to go.  Am I a terrorist?  No.  You're just a very disturbed individual. 
[03:41:00]  And we wanted to bring that out in the light.  Show people so they stop thinking about those bodies coming home from Afghanistan.  Yeah, it puts us in a very weird situation.  And with Obama and the new attorney general and everything, it's kind of â€“ I'm just not an Obama guy.  I've never been a Democrat or liberal guy.  And I just see like a weakening of it.  I know that a few people were recently released from Guantanamo.  And it's like, you know something, I just heard that 25 or 30 people were released from Guantanamo. 
[03:41:30]  Could you please somewhere print what they were doing, why they were there?  I want to personally know who is getting the fuck out of there after they've been held so long.  Maybe it is some guy that's like, hey, dude, I was buying some fucking cigarettes and this guy with a George Bush mask comes up and grabs me and threw me in Guantanamo back.  Or maybe this guy on some weird technicality thing, they're like, well, we think it is, but I want to know what he did. 
[03:42:00]  This is how I sleep at night.  When I think about stuff like that, I just assume.  Remember when I smoke a joint and I'm just like, you know what?  They probably inserted a tracker deep into his rectum that he doesn't feel.  Oh, fuck.  Didn't even think of that.  That's all I assume.  I'm like, it's the fucking government.  They're not going to let terrorists out.  You know, they've got them covered.  Not necessarily true because you look at the way they're fucking prosecuting CIA guys now.  I know.  It's sickening.  That's another thing.  Like under the Obama administration, when they got it, when they're taking CIA agents, FBI agents that have been doing interrogations at Guantanamo and in Iraq. 
[03:42:30]  And then they're being ordered.  They're being told by the previous administration what to do, how to conduct these interrogations.  What information is needed, getting the information and using it and sharing it amongst the agencies, whatever they do now, post 9-11.  And then the new administration comes in and now you've got to sit there and worry like, wait a minute.  They're talking about bringing me up on fucking charges for interrogating this guy in a way that you don't like, but the administration before thought was fine. 
[03:43:00]  How do you even go to that place and, I mean, really, how do you, as a president, as an attorney general, as a secretary of state, go to the people in this country and say you're even thinking that without the people going, look, motherfucker.  All right, we had 9-11.  Since then, they've thwarted a few things.  So if someone's got to get some water poured up their fucking nose to keep windows on the world up, you know, at some point, so be it. 
[03:43:30]  All right.  But, yeah, I think there is a weakening going on as far as the intelligence, world intelligence goes.  Everyone inhabits this planet, a bunch of Homo sapiens.  Deep inside, we're all Cro-Mags.  We all just want to beat the fuck out of each other.  We just want to act like very savage.  People think we're Vulcans.  We kind of, we put ourselves into, exactly, we've kind of built ourselves through civility and laws across the land so we can act better than our animal forebears. 
[03:44:00]  We're not that civilized.  And then you see it in moments like this.  You just see violence, the violence that's inherent.  And it's sometimes inexplicable.  I read a story about this bear that they moved into the cage, I guess, in Japan or something like that.  Two bears living together, fine, for years, or maybe it wasn't four years, months.  And then all of a sudden, that one bear, like, starts tearing the other fucking bear apart.  And it's like, where did that happen?  Yeah, and everybody's like, why'd he do that?  And it's like, because he's a fucking animal.  That's what they do.  They have no explanation.  Because he doesn't sit there and go, oh, I might get caught. 
[03:44:30]  Or, you know, I shouldn't do it.  We had a great conversation one time.  Or, like, is there a heaven?  Will I get punished for this?  It's just a fucking animal, man.  And it's like, all this other stuff we've assigned, and it really complicates a very simple issue.  People can't understand motivations.  There's no need to understand motivation.  There's no motivation.  They're fucking animals.  Some people are broken, and they're going to act like that.  And just the fact that you look back just a few tens of thousands of years, we're so short-sighted as far as time goes. 
[03:45:00]  Because we're so proud of ourselves.  We're like, look how far we've come.  It's such a short time.  Look what we did.  We've so outdone ourselves technologically compared to, I think, our ability to soak it all in, for the most part.  As an animal on this planet, we are so fucking short on the evolutionary scale.  Oh, we got our big brains, and we got our thumbs, and look at us.  Wow, we're amazing.  But there is still something in us that when we look at people, especially different people, we want to smash their fucking heads in. 
[03:45:30]  Or, if you're not feeling violent toward them, you feel at least suspicious.  Suspicious.  There's something.  And it's the wolf going around and making that weird little thing and putting his ears back and looking like, grrr, grrr.  We do the same fucking thing.  It's not racially bent, dude.  No.  It's white people, black people, Asian people.  Right.  It's just, it's strangers.  It's who you are.  And if you notice.  That's how an animal reacts to strangers.  Yep.  They kind of take a step back, or they brace themselves.  And we live in a civil world, so we think we could just put our hand out and be like, hello, how are you? 
[03:46:00]  And somebody can sometimes just fucking knife you.  And we love, like, I think we love forcing people to believe that we're a lot more social within each other than we really are.  If you look at your group of friends, they mostly compose, mostly, of people like you, you know, of the same basic race, background, things like that.  It's just, I don't know what, but that's just the way it is.  I think you're more comfortable in that surroundings.  Not everybody.  And I think a lot more people. 
[03:46:30]  I think a situation like that has more to do with nature, or not nature, nurture versus nature.  Nurture versus nature?  Yeah.  Really?  If you grow up in a mixed race community, you're absolutely comfortable being around mixed race people, or people who aren't necessarily look exactly like you.  I think if you grow up, I grew up in the kind of lily white suburbs of New Jersey.  I didn't know any black people until I got older and stuff, because our town would, I mean, you know what I don't even want to talk about.  One time I talked about my hometown affectionately in Time magazine, and I referred to it, I was just like, you know, I came from a white trash town, but I was being very affectionate. 
[03:47:00]  I was referring also to myself as white trash.  An article comes out, town holds a meeting about what they should do to react to this blatant slander.  Hang him!  Meanwhile, I grew up in the town and was called fucking white trash because I lived downtown instead of uptown.  And then I got fucking persecuted for saying that by people who lived uptown.  It was so weird, dude.  I've called Long Island white trash all the time.  I laugh when people say it because I am. 
[03:47:30]  And it's not, I don't mean, I mean, people, I guess, take that as an insult, but it's just, I meant, maybe I meant working class or blue collar, but to me, that white trash.  Same thing.  See what the fucking mayor of Newark was doing with that call?  With that call?  It was awesome.  Holy shit.  Conan made a joke on the show where he goes like, there's a healthcare, you're talking about a new healthcare system in Newark.  It's that they, the mayor's going to buy a ticket to send you out of Newark.  To leave Newark.  To leave Newark.  That's funny.  And so the mayor of Newark put up a video on YouTube where he was just, they say it's a bit comedic, but a little broad, but essentially his message was just like, you know, by the powers invested in me as the mayor of Newark, you're on the no-fly list at Newark Airport. 
[03:48:00]  He's like, you're not allowed into Newark at all.  It was kind of funny though, because he's going like, let me tell you about Newark.  Newark is growing.  Our crime rate is going down.  It's like, dude, it's fucking Newark.  Newark sucks.  Shut up.  Stop it.  Oh, it's got the rocks.  It's got the Prudential Center.  Until it becomes something else.  It's, maybe it's changing.  Eh, not quite yet.  You go around the Prudential Center, dude, it's really safe, really nice, and that'll just extend out from there. 
[03:48:30]  They never really, they haven't had anything there in a long time.  Yeah, but they also have, from the train station in Newark, they also have a walkway where you don't have to actually go on the street to go to the Prudential Center.  There you go.  You know what I mean?  Bulletproof fucking tunnel.  Yeah, they do.  You walk over the road all the way to there.  It's nice.  Newark's not as bad as people say, man.  You know what's not as bad as people say, too?  You're such a Jersey guy.  I love it.  I am.  I got to apologize for it.  It's not as bad.  You're a jug-handled, no-left-turn-making motherfucker.  I am.  I am a jug-handled man. 
[03:49:00]  It's so weird being other places.  And I turn right on red all the time.  I know.  I get fucked up in California and Newark.  Oops.  It's so weird.  Particularly in New York, like when I was out here shooting all summer, I would always lurch, and then somebody would be like, ah, ah, ah, New York.  I was like, fuck.  And then when you do it, you go, well, I'll just tell the guy, look, I'm from New Jersey.  You're allowed to do it there.  Like, they're going to go, yeah.  I shot that one to the library.  That corner of the library is where they sit and catch people all the time.  They do that to me.  And I was like, oh, I'm sorry, man, I'm from New Jersey.  We can turn right on red.  He's like, yeah, I don't care.  You're in New York.  It's the only way you learn. 
[03:49:30]  We're running out of time.  Wow, what a day.  This really flew by.  Is the show ending?  Yeah.  It really flew by today, didn't it?  Yep.  Yes.  Plugs.  I'm very neglectful as far as that.  Come see me.  Come see me at remembering to plug people's games.  Barnes & Noble.  I just sit there and imagine.  When are you at Barnes & Noble?  Where are you?  Barnes & Noble today.  It's 7 o'clock down in Union Square in New York City.  Kevin's signing the edition of his, paperback edition of his book.  Signing the new book, the Shooting the Shit with Kevin Smith.  Oh, this is a new book?  Yeah, it's a brand new one.  Oh, Shooting the Shit with Kevin Smith.  It's based on the Smodcast. 
[03:50:00]  Okay, cool.  It's on the Smodcast.  We kind of transcribed them.  They're very funny.  It's a read, actually.  More so than just listen to.  I'll keep that next to my shitter.  That's a total shitter reader, dude.  Good shitter book.  It is.  It's one kind of thing where you're like, and sometimes you're like, you know, I shit in the  first 30 seconds, but I'm going to read three chapters.  I'm just going to sit here until my legs are like baby fawns.  I enjoy my own smell.  I smell like a woman's ass.  Chapter three, you give a courtesy flush.  I mean, Danny, we were just talking about that the other day where you forget to grab  your iPhone or something before you go to the toilet. 
[03:50:30]  And you're like, I was going to bowl.  You can't do shit anymore, man.  Now it's just like you got to bring in an activity.  Every down minute, man.  Of course.  Especially sitting on the toilet.  Chicks get in and out.  Chicks have no fun in the bathroom.  They go.  They're shamed of their poo.  They flush it and quick run out.  You never see a chick with butt hickey.  Same thing.  Never see that.  Yep.  But it's butt hickey.  It's butt hickey.  But you're right, dude.  There's not a time I go in the bathroom.  I don't have something in my iPhone, fucking computer.  You forget how boring shit it actually is. 
[03:51:00]  Totally.  And then when you're stuck there with nothing, you're like, this sucks.  In the old days, what'd you do?  Just looked inside the toilet and tried to make celebrity faces out of the lawn.  Gene Stapleton.  Jim, you're going to be where?  Well, a season three of that premiere of that metal show is this Saturday night, 11 o'clock  on VH1 Classic.  Anvil's on.  A one-hour special we did with them.  Kevin, did you see that movie?  Anvil, Astoria Anvil, about that metal band from the 80s.  The faux metal.  It's a faux documentary? 
[03:51:30]  Is it real?  It's real.  I've never seen it.  Dude, it's coming out on VH1, but it just came out on DVD.  It's phenomenal.  What are they?  Speed metal?  Black metal?  No, they were just like a thrash, like Anthrax Metallica.  They started at the same time, early 80s.  And this is a doc that looks back on them?  What is the thrust of the doc?  Why is it so interesting?  The drummer and the guitar player, when they were 14 years old, said, made a pack.  We're going to be a band.  We're not going to stop until we make it.  They're in their mid-50s, and they're still trying.  Oh, I've got to watch this.  It's amazing.  Yet they've influenced every band.  Every band.  Really?  Yeah, they put out great thrash albums. 
[03:52:00]  And they've never broken.  They were at the top, like with Metallic Anthrax.  All those bands came out.  They were right there.  And those guys just took off, and Anvil just went nowhere.  And it has a metal name, dude.  Yeah, Anvil.  But unfortunately, it's the name that, like, sinks everything as heavy as an anvil.  And their signature song is Metal on Metal, and it's just a great song.  And they're in their 50s, and they work day jobs, like delivering food.  And then they're doing these games.  It's an awesome movie.  And the dream is alive still.  And then now they're at the point where they just opened for ACDC at Giant Stadium.  It's a whole stadium tour, because the movie's just taken a whole lot. 
[03:52:30]  I was going to say, like, after this movie airs, then their dream will come true.  Which is kind of odd, that not making it has been the fuel for them to make it.  Had we ever known, all we had to do was subject our dignity to a TV documentary.  And you know what happened was, when they were, like, 17 years old, this kid over in England,  they're doing a marquee in London.  This kid comes backstage, a big fan.  He goes, I'm a big fan of you guys.  I'll show you around London.  They're like, all right, yeah, sure.  And they went with this kid.  And they go, you know what?  You're a cool kid.  If you want to be our roadie, be our roadie. 
[03:53:00]  The kid was a roadie for him for a year.  The guy, they lost touch to him.  He wound up being a director.  This guy, Sachi Gavirza or something like that.  He wrote The Terminal, the Tom Hanks movie.  Oh, really?  And a couple other movies.  He went to Hollywood, became a big screenwriter.  Big star.  And then three years ago, he goes, you know what?  Whatever happened to that band Anvil?  He looks them up.  He's like, holy shit, they're still together.  So he did the doc?  He did the doc.  He calls them up.  He goes, hey, Lips, the singer.  He goes, what are you doing?  He goes, we're still trying to make it.  I'm 53.  He's like, holy shit, this is a documentary.  That's awesome.  We made that pack.  When is it air?  When's that air?  It's this week.  I think Saturday night right before on VH1 Classic. 
[03:53:30]  It's great.  Anvil story, Anvil.  But it's just out on DVD.  It's an amazing movie.  And it's on DVD as well.  Yeah, it's on DVD.  That's where I can look for it.  Yeah.  It's cool.  And then I'll be at the Improv in Cleveland tonight through Sunday.  And I'm going to LA.  I got a bunch of shows on sale.  But next week, not this weekend, the following weekend, Friday and Saturday, only the Denver Improv.  I had to cancel Thursday, so I'm doing Leno next week as well.  Oh, look at you.  How many have you done so far?  How many have you done?  I saw you when you were doing the first one.  How many have you done now?  Just the one.  Just the one.  Yeah, I wasn't. 
[03:54:00]  It was great.  No, shut up.  It was good.  Oh, your teeth, your smile.  You looked fantastic, Jim.  It was fine.  His mother calling was hysterical.  Really?  You looked great.  You're so handsome.  Yeah, they showed you nice teeth.  So good to see you.  He had a nice shirt on.  Yeah, yeah, everything.  He was well-dressed.  Everything wonderful.  He looked happy.  Yeah, we got one minute to wrap up.  We're drastically out of time.  Bye.  No, no, no.  I'll wait.  No, okay.  Well, tomorrow, I think, is David Duchovny tomorrow? 
[03:54:30]  Yes.  Okay, David Duchovny tomorrow.  And Opie will be back.  He's got a sore throat.  Thanks for hanging out with us today.  We'll see you tomorrow. </pre>
