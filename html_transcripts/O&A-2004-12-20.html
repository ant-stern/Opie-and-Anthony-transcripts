<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with the fallout from their former program director, Frankie Blue's, drunken on-air meltdown at WNEW.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, played a recording of Blue’s slurred ramblings, which included offensive language and station name confusion. They gleefully dissected the ensuing media coverage in the New York Post and Daily News, speculating about a possible pre-incident argument with a female DJ and excessive Christmas party drinking.  This segment included listener calls and messages, discussion of WNEW's alleged post-Opie and Anthony decline (using offensive language),  a brief mention of the St. Patrick's Cathedral sex broadcast incident,  and hints at undisclosed future events via coded messages. Producer Ben was present in the studio, and the show featured their regular "Opie and Anthony F.U. Life" segment of listener-submitted offensive messages.

The show then transitioned to their return from a holiday break, marked by laziness and near-firing, which they jokingly suggested was necessary for motivation.  A bizarre banana-related segment occurred, followed by discussions of *Boogie Nights* and Anthony's short film with Nina Hartley.  A significant portion detailed a high-profile meeting with Fareed from Citadel Broadcasting, focusing on their move to satellite radio and potential syndication, punctuated by Fareed's anti-Howard Stern sentiment.  The unexpected twist was revealed: Opie and Anthony were temporarily filling in for Howard Stern on Syracuse's 95X, much to their delight and anticipation of listener backlash. They discussed the challenges of adapting their satellite show for commercial broadcast, including censoring offensive material, and took several listener calls. The segment concluded with a Publishers Clearing House prank call and further speculation on commercial radio expansion. Profanity and sexually explicit references were prevalent throughout.

The next segment covered their successful transition to XM Satellite Radio and the disastrous party thrown by their friend Frenchie.  They discussed the technical difficulties faced by 95X in airing their show due to last-minute preparations and credited Alan, a dentist and radio message board administrator, for his support during their previous station woes.  The underwhelming turnout of Frenchie’s party was contrasted with Ben's more successful and outrageous parties, including one in a former massage parlor.  The conversation touched on stock market speculation regarding Sirius and XM.  A listener-submitted audio segment included a comedically inappropriate sexual harassment training video, a crude Christmas song, an unsettling song titled "O'Connor," a song about menstruation, and a highly explicit Christmas-themed song about oral sex.  They also briefly discussed a potential New York City comedian strike and further technical issues with their Syracuse affiliate. Opie shared an anecdote about a flight with Patrice O'Neill where he was accused of diabetes due to frequent urination.

The show then explored their music selection process, their Syracuse move, and their continued satellite radio broadcast.  A caller, Dave, who traveled from Binghamton to Syracuse to hear their show, was interviewed.  They further discussed adapting their content for commercial radio, contrasting it with the freedom of their satellite broadcast. A sexually suggestive game, "Guess What's in My Pants," was played with a female caller, Christine.  A listener’s eggnog drinking contest experience and subsequent fallout were also discussed.  A significant portion featured an interview with William Shatner, promoting his album "Has Been," focusing on his spoken-word interpretations of songs like "Mr. Tambourine Man" and "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds," his feelings about being a "has-been," his past work, his role in *Boston Legal*, and a possible *Star Trek* return.  The interview included playful banter and concluded with the playing of two songs from the album.  The segment ended with listener calls offering humorous and often crude observations.

Finally, a caller, Jason, criticized the day's show as "stanked," leading to a humorous exchange with Opie about the caller's truck-driving schedule and the suggestion that the best parts aired while he wasn't listening.  Opie made a crude joke, and John concluded the segment by sharing a Greek word for "little pussy."  No guests were in studio for this final segment.

[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  You know the Holocaust? 
[00:04:00]  Uh-huh.  Picture the exact opposite of that.  Wow, that's really nice.  That's just too good to be true for both people.  Do you realize who you hired?  Beautiful girls...  What kind of sick mind operates like that?  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  And again. 
[00:05:00]  Is that supposed to be sexy? 
[00:05:30]  God, have you missed Friday's show?  It came down to this.  Eggnog pump.  Oh, wow.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show.  God, is that disgusting.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America as we speak. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, that'll spread the virus, all right.  And, oh, it's really spreading today.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Okay, Boogie.  Look what we do now.  Look what we do to you now.  Morning, Anthony.  All right, Boogie.  Flip the switch.  Have a good vacation, you hump.  Oh, we're getting into that a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Are you gleeful?  Yeah, I'm gleeful today.  I know you were gleeful over the weekend because I read it, so I know you were gleeful.  Greg Opie Hughes was gleeful.  I didn't think that whole Frankie Blue thing we did on Friday was that big of a deal, but  I guess it was, huh?  Apparently so.  That's so funny when you're quoted as being gleeful.  We could get right into that, I guess.  Sure.  Or we could get into why I'm tired today.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a little beat, too, but the reason you have for being tired is pretty funny.  Yeah, well, first of all, in New York City, it just stinks. 
[00:07:00]  It decided to snow.  Yeah, winter decided it's here.  Just when you thought, ah, winter's here and it's not that bad here in New York City.  Not that bad.  We've been getting off the hook.  You know, it hasn't been frigid cold, and we haven't had any snow.  So it's kind of been like a real prolonged fall.  Nothing.  Usually, sometimes if it snows in the beginning of November, it just makes the winter seem  so long.  Yeah, yeah.  And we've been lucky up until almost the end of December. 
[00:07:30]  And then, snow.  So it's cold.  It's icy.  It stinks.  It's just awful.  It's time to start figuring out where we're going to broadcast for the winter.  One good thing, the homeless people were off the street.  I didn't have to step over them on my walk here.  Well, we're finding out.  We'll get into that later, too.  Most of these homeless people are fakes.  Yeah.  That's why you shouldn't give anyone money, I guess.  They have their scams just like the rest of everybody.  Right.  But anyway, I went to bed at a decent hour because we do this morning radio thing. 
[00:08:00]  Got to get to bed early.  And I'm out cold.  And all of a sudden, I think I'm dreaming because I'm hearing Christmas songs.  So you were dreaming.  And it was snowing out, right?  The snow started last night, about 9, I guess, 8.30.  I don't know.  What a quaint scene.  And I hear Christmas songs.  I'm like, I cannot be hearing Christmas songs.  And I'm thinking that I'm dreaming.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, it's really loud outside my window where the homeless people usually sleep.  Uh-huh.  And I'm like, there's no way. 
[00:08:30]  I'm like, this has to be a dream.  So I get up, and I peek through the blinds, and there's like 20 people lined up outside my apartment,  staring at my apartment, and singing Christmas carols.  They're caroling, Anthony.  Carolers.  I thought it was 1860, because it wasn't just carolers.  They were dressed up like it was 1860.  Were they holding candles?  They were holding, yeah, actually, they were holding candles.  They all had a candle each, and a song book.  And a little song book in the other hand. 
[00:09:00]  And there were couples, and they're like kind of arm in arm.  One's holding the candle.  One's holding the song book.  And the one girl's like leaning over at her boyfriend or husband, and they're just gleefully singing Christmas carols.  Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh.  Exactly.  Are they doing that?  Boom, boom, boom.  Some of the other guys are going, oh, oh, oh.  I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.  They had their scarves on and their little winter hats.  I'm like, I'm trying to sleep.  Usually I get woken up by the homeless guys going through my trash or the cabs that have 
[00:09:30]  to beep because they're in a hurry always.  What the hell year is it?  I thought it was 1860 when I woke up.  It's Manhattan.  It's Manhattan, right.  There's people walking around caroling.  Was there a big fight down at the five points?  What the hell is going on in this city?  The best is, though, I wanted to be the guy because I knew someone would be the guy.  Yeah.  I wanted to be the guy, shut the fuck up.  Shut up.  He's trying to sleep. 
[00:10:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  But I heard in a distance some asshole opening his window like, will you shut the fuck up?  Oh, great.  Wonderful.  There's the spirit.  Just when I was getting into the spirit of living in 1860 with the snow softly falling  and the candles.  Were you getting that big, curly, Grinch smile at the end of the Grinch cartoon?  You were finally, your eyes got real big and teary.  You know, because you know me. 
[00:10:30]  I'm an asshole just like yourself and just like Jimmy Norton.  I wanted to be the asshole and wreck it for everybody, but you're right.  The more I looked through the blinds, I was kind of getting a little happy.  Like, ah, I think I'm finally in the Christmas spirit.  Look at these.  Look at these go-getters.  This is nice.  It's snowing and I'm getting the Christmas spirit.  I think I'm going to go out and tell them.  Shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  Who's that guy upstairs?  It was down the street.  I don't know exactly what he said, but it was some guy just losing his mind. 
[00:11:00]  Like, you've got to be fucking kidding me.  And the heavy New York accent, which took me right out of being in 1860.  Just ruined it.  Then they jumped on their horse and sleigh and went to the next brownstone.  You know what goes nicely with some caroling like that?  If you open the door and you have a nice bucket of ice water.  That would have been good.  And their stupid faces.  These people were just so happy to be alive.  And I'm just like, where do they get them?  What is it?  Like a club?  I don't know.  Because where do you get that many people to do anything in New York? 
[00:11:30]  The Upper West Side is like a neighborhood.  People are so jaded.  So I'm sure there were signs up in the restaurants or the local drugstore or the hardware store.  Go caroling.  We're going to be caroling.  Let's meet at Columbus Circle at 8 o'clock at night Sunday.  Bring candles, everybody.  A night of caroling turned tragic last night when a homeless man bludgeoned three of them  with a cinder block.  That's a New York story.  Yep.  Oh.  You got a little piece of the holiday spirit at least for about three seconds. 
[00:12:00]  It's just that I'm tired because, you know, when you get woken up, you can't really go  back to sleep, right?  What ungodly hour was this, Opie?  I'm telling you.  It was like nine.  Oh.  It's so late.  I know.  Hey, when you peeked out the window, did you have your little stocking cap on?  I sure did, Jimmy.  I sure did.  With the corners of your windowpane fogged up, you have to get the steam off, and then  Opie's smiling face with a little Christmas cap peeking out.  I had my little candle holder that I had to light. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  I had to put my slippers on, and I slowly made my way to the window.  Were you wearing red feety pajamas with a little trap door for your dumps in the back?  A little button trap door as you scurried down the hallway to get a better look at the  carolers?  It was Christmas past, I guess.  Hearing the jingle and jangle of the jingle bells outside?  It was just awful.  I wanted to be so mad, but then I was like, well, I guess this is kind of cool. 
[00:13:00]  Get a little piece of it, sure.  Better than the homeless guys going through my trash.  I have nothing in my neighborhood.  I really wanted to do something this year, because I live just in a Jewish neighborhood,  and I'm like the only Catholic in town, and I really wanted to do it up and let all the  Jewish people know that there's a Catholic living there that celebrates Christmas.  I wanted to hang the lights up and everything, but I just do nothing.  Don't you usually call them hebes? 
[00:13:30]  No, Opie.  I don't think I do.  Okay, I just wondered.  No, they're Jewish people.  They celebrate Hanukkah.  I don't use such racist terms.  Have you seen a lot of Hanukkah bushes?  I've never seen a Hanukkah bush in my life.  I don't think they exist.  Is there a paper towel for my snotty, running, cold New York City nose?  Quick, Ben.  Anthony wants a paper towel.  Both my paper towels.  Those pompous asses, they're short Christmas trees.  They're not Hanukkah bushes.  Yeah.  Now, a lot of menorahs in the windows. 
[00:14:00]  And the reason they don't get full Christmas trees is because they're just cheap.  So they get the...  Opie, you're just carrying on a stereotype, Opie.  So they just get the short dwarf trees that they can't sell.  Oh my God, I can't do anything.  My nose is ready to drip.  All right, it's coming.  Oh, I need something.  Ben with his...  Oh my goodness.  Ben with his winter cap on.  Thank you, Ben.  Just one.  What are you...  Oh.  Wow, that was close.  Hi, Ben.  I almost had a little Christmas drip of snot on my keyboard. 
[00:14:30]  That salty...  That salty drip on the upper lip.  Yeah.  Yum.  Oh, a bubble.  Yum, yum, yum.  Hey, Kerry from California.  What's up?  I just wanted to say good morning, guys.  Morning.  Hi.  And, uh...  Hi, Beth.  Wow.  What?  I think you want to say you're surprised that Pat's stomach didn't explode on Friday  during the eggnog drinking contest.  Wow, you really deciphered that, Opie.  Thank you, Anthony.  Thank you.  I'm a mind reader. 
[00:15:00]  What?  Teddy.  All right.  Maybe you could call back your phone stank.  Oh, your phone...  Oh, my God.  Oh, that sound.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right.  So, the Frankie Blue thing took on a life of its own, huh?  Yeah, it was big news.  Really big news in the radio industry, Opie. 
[00:15:30]  Everybody from what I hear...  Radio industry?  We made page three of the New York Post because of this stupid thing.  Well, that's what I mean.  It's big news, but also in the radio industry, now the tape is being passed around to everyone  in the business.  Right.  And it's like the Jerky Boys tape was years ago.  This is being passed around in the radio business.  Yeah, well, we made page three of the New York Post on Saturday.  I guess it was a slow news day.  And now we made the Daily News today because, you know, David Hinckley is so out of touch  and has to wait for, like, John Minnelli and everyone else to write the story. 
[00:16:00]  And then he goes, oh, I better write about this.  It's big news.  Oh, Opie.  Well, you've read his stupid radio column.  He talks about what the classical music station's doing for Christmas.  Leave the little old guy alone.  He just, you know, he still has a radio with tubes that he listens to.  He just, he's not really up to date anymore.  He writes about, like Opie said, what's happening at the classical station.  Right.  Like it's big news.  Mozart Christmas songs all weekend long on WQXR maybe. 
[00:16:30]  Some station you never heard of.  Yeah, all right.  Speaking of the radio world, all hell is breaking loose in the radio world as we speak right now.  Oh, boy.  We'll get into that maybe a little later.  Talk about news.  I think this might.  Yeah, I think your pals are going to be big news today.  Okay, it's going to make this silly Frankie Blue thing that we did on Friday.  And it's just the beginning. 
[00:17:00]  That's right.  Whoa.  Oh, the devil.  Oh, it's just you.  We've only just begun.  That's why we always say Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  Whether we believe it or not.  When we say it.  Hey, you know what?  Before we talk about it, maybe we should.  Yeah, baby.  I want to be like Frankie Blue.  Wear some booze.  Maybe before we talk about this thing that is going down as we speak.  The thing. 
[00:17:30]  Maybe we should make sure that the thing is actually going down.  That would be silly.  There was no problems with the thing.  Wouldn't we feel like silly geese?  Hey, it's going down.  A kingdom of nakedness.  A kingdom of nakedness.  No, no, nude.  Totally nude.  Oh, poor Scorch.  Oh, he's our pal.  We love the Scorch, too.  I know.  Wouldn't it surprise me if it got screwed up?  Oh, we thought it was for Tuesday. 
[00:18:00]  How did my personality leap from my body to yours?  That's all I want to know.  Because I just don't have it in me anymore to do what you do.  I think all of us have certain scumbag qualities that have rubbed off on the other.  It's just a horrible thing for family and friends to realize that you could even be worse than you were.  The fact that we've taken the murder of a pregnant woman and made it a well of comedic fodder.  Sport.  Good sport.  Comedic sport.  I wouldn't say we on that one.  The listeners have really... 
[00:18:30]  I have stayed out of that one.  ...taken hold and done awful things with the Peterson story.  Yeah.  I don't know what inspired them to do such a thing.  I don't know.  Could be all the little remarks in this room, followed by the console slaps and good-natured  chuckles.  Well, now they're making signs.  The Lil' Conor, Opie and Anthony XM Saturday radio signs.  And a donkey sausage sign.  These signs, I guess, are for people if they want to do our assault on the media.  Oh, okay.  That's what we've talked about.  Oh, all right.  Look how we just go off on subjects without any rhyme or reason. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, but the beauty of this radio show, by 10 o'clock, it all will make sense.  It all wraps up.  It's like the first time you saw Pulp Fiction.  What the hell is that?  What?  They put the beginning at the end and the middle and they're going on and then all at the end?  Ah, I get it now.  It makes sense.  Yeah.  Look what we do now.  And we don't have to do radio this way.  We used to do radio this way so people would listen longer.  Now they just listen because it's satellite radio.  They either have the service or they don't have the service.  But what if we were on regular radio? 
[00:19:30]  Well, that's why.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Okay, boogie.  Is that another hint?  Tune it in.  Okay, boogie.  Someone better wake up John Minnelli.  He's got a story to write today.  Don't you!  He's scaring Jimmy.  Even the devil comes.  All right.  So Frankie Blue was big news over the weekend.  I thought it was just a throwaway bit that we did.  We really should do this bit. 
[00:20:00]  Okay?  And then we'll do the other thing.  Let's talk about the newsworthy Frankie Blue story.  And Earl did not get us the tape.  I'm hearing that.  He is so nervous.  Everyone is blaming Black Earl.  He is so nervous.  We're talking about, of course, our old radio station.  We've got to set it up again because we have a lot of new listeners since we were on the air Friday.  Our old station went into the toilet after we left, and they haven't been able to figure it out since.  And we take quite a lot of joy in that. 
[00:20:30]  Oh.  Right?  Yes.  And so I guess they were having their Christmas party.  Mm-hmm.  And I heard that everyone got really hammered.  It was a Christmas luncheon.  A luncheon.  So then the luncheon's over, and then you've had a few drinks, and the sun's out.  What are you going to do?  You know what I mean?  You're not going to the gym.  You're not going to go Christmas shopping.  What are you going to do at that point?  You don't stop.  I think you continue drinking.  You keep drinking because if you stop, it's all over.  You've got to continue drinking into the night's activity.  And you have to at least drink until it's nighttime, so then you feel like, oh, okay, it's nighttime. 
[00:21:00]  Now I can go home and maybe crash early or do what I have to do.  So it's my opinion that they got pretty hammered at their Christmas luncheon.  Nothing worse than the 9 p.m. hangover.  You know, if you're drinking in the afternoon and you stop.  Yeah.  It's like 9 o'clock at night, and you're completely engulfed in a hangover.  And dehydrated and all that.  Yeah, you keep drinking.  Go ahead.  I was going to say, you can't stop until it's time to go home.  You just got to keep going until you're behind that wheel. 
[00:21:30]  You hear a scream, and you see a little hair ribbon fly across your windshield.  Oh, are you insane?  A little hair ribbon and a little strap patent leather shoe.  White.  So the tinkle of a teddy bear eye as it smashes off your windshield.  Oh, my God.  Are you insane?  Who got under your skin today?  A little purse full of chiclets.  Jesus. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, is that horrible?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No one has figured it out yet.  That's very interesting.  All right.  Anyway, so Frankie Blue is the program director at our old joint.  And they're now attempting to do, like, disco dance music or something.  Disco dance music?  Well, what would you call it?  I don't know.  Rhythm and rhythm dance hits of the 80s and 90s?  I don't even know what they call that. 
[00:22:30]  Crap.  And today?  Crap.  What's their slug line?  Well, no.  The format's called CHR slash rhythmic, isn't it?  Music to have butt sex to?  I mean, what is it?  Rhythmic?  You know, that's what they call it in the trades.  Isn't all music rhythmic?  Yeah, that's what they call it.  Yeah, it's disco dance music, like Opie said.  All right.  So, after we got fired for the St. Pat's incident, you know, the brainiacs at our old company, John Sykes especially, you know, thought they could, you know, run the radio station without us.  Right.  And they're finding out the hard way, they just can't. 
[00:23:00]  It's been two years and four months, and the place is still a disaster.  You've got to give it time, Opie.  It's a slow bill.  It's bleeding money.  There was an article that they had to admit that they've lost millions upon millions of dollars on that radio station alone.  Oops.  And they've tried all sorts of formats, and this latest one is this, you know, this dance music that you can butt fuck to.  Ooh.  And so Frankie Blue is the guy that they brought in because he used to work at this station in New York called KTU, which was a powerhouse for this stupid music format. 
[00:23:30]  Wasn't it a powerhouse, like, years ago?  I guess.  I don't even know anymore.  They've called it the new KTU for, like, 20 years.  Yeah, back when disco was really big, I guess, in the late 70s, it was huge.  And they've been running off of that success for years and years and years now.  Remember the old sales guy at NEW used to talk about when he worked at KTU, and it was just suitcases full of cash and cocaine going in and out of the place? 
[00:24:00]  Was that Gary?  Yeah.  Yeah, talking about KTU in the older days.  Right.  So they have this luncheon, and Frankie Blue is, you know, he's in charge of trying to right that horrendous ship over there.  And I guess he goes back to the station, and rumor has it he gets in a fight with the DJ that was about to go on the air.  This is all rumors.  We're speculating.  But something went down, and she ran out of the place. 
[00:24:30]  I've heard, like, crying.  Really?  Yeah.  But I can't confirm it.  This is all alleged.  Whatever.  We're just, you know, like anyone else, just spreading rumors, I guess.  Ben just gave a thumbs up, which means it's true.  He knows everything.  Dude.  Oh, well, we'd get a Ben impression, but Norton's mouth is full.  What a surprise.  Frankie Blue got drunk with Tom Brady, and then he had to go on the air.  Yeah.  And then he just sits there and eats. 
[00:25:00]  Hey, there's a...  You ever chomp into a bit of onion in your omelet, and then you realize it's your cell phone?  Hey, there's a listener on the line that knows the big secret.  Stop.  Are you kidding?  No.  Radio gets interesting today.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Let me see.  I have to give a secret message to Biv.  Biv?  There's a secret message.  Yeah, we'll get into that a little bit. 
[00:25:30]  A little bit.  Let's see.  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Another message.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  And this is to Tom.  All right.  And Bob.  Very good.  All secret messages are out.  There's a lot of questions that have to be answered today.  We'll answer all the questions. 
[00:26:00]  I want them answered immediately.  All right.  So, yeah.  So, there's this argument that ensued after the drunken luncheon Christmas thing.  Yeah.  So, friend.  I wonder what that was about.  Ben, does anyone know what that argument was about?  Or was he just a little hammer?  And you're speculating, so, you know.  Yeah.  Well, what I would speculate is the party was at 1 o'clock, and this happened at 8 o'clock,  and there was some sort of argument over something that...  Dude, Ben was text messaging me that night Friday. 
[00:26:30]  Ben loves this stuff.  All night Fridays.  Let me tell you something.  Dude, Kane in Detroit says it.  The biggest thing that's going on in radio.  Let me tell you.  Like, Earl's all nervous.  Go, hey, Barberto.  Hey.  Earl is nervous.  Earl's here shows.  I got text messages from...  Earl was stammering like Tuma from The Great Santini.  I'm going to hurt you, Frankie.  Hey, Tuma, this thing spread like wildfire through the business.  Everybody was talking about it on Friday.  And you know what?  Everybody.  Oh, yeah.  And everyone is blaming Earl for giving us the tape. 
[00:27:00]  Earl did not give us the tape.  No, no.  Earl is innocent.  We have spies at Infinity Broadcasting that go very high up.  Very deep.  Very deep.  We have deep penetration.  We really do have deep penetration at our old company.  And Earl had nothing to do with this.  God forbid that idiot should help this radio show for once.  I know, right?  Of course he wouldn't have said that.  That would be helpful.  I know, right?  The guy should come across at something like that.  No.  He should have been in there.  He should be telling us, because he was in the studio live with Frankie. 
[00:27:30]  He was running the board.  Right.  He should be on the phone letting us know every play-by-play that happened that day.  What the argument was about.  He should have been...  What it was like between when Frankie was on the air.  Right.  He should have been running audio, yeah, while the music was playing.  Right.  So, uh...  Worthless.  So, Frankie Blue, who's, quote, this legend...  Yeah.  ...in radio, he's a joke, actually.  He just got lucky.  There's a lot of guys that just get lucky and then, uh, you know...  And then...  No Dave Dickless.  ...and then stick around forever. 
[00:28:00]  So, uh...  He decides, well, his jock, you know, ran out crying or whatever she did.  So, he's like, ah, I can handle it.  I'll just go on the air.  Fuck her.  It's easy.  I don't know if he said fuck her, but...  Well, you still think he wanted...  You know, he thinks his morning show is going to fuck over the listeners.  Which was reported in the Post article.  So, he goes on the air and, uh...  He's slurring his words and, uh...  So bad.  He's mentioning the...  He's, he's, uh...  Using the, the competition's call letters and... 
[00:28:30]  Oops.  And, uh...  Just babbling on like an idiot.  When you're supposed to...  When you work for one of these stations, you're supposed to just talk for, like,  10, 15 seconds at a time.  That's where we got the tape from.  Oh!  That's where we got the tape from.  Ixnay on the ape-tay.  Yeah.  That's the person that gave us the tape right there.  Thank you.  And you may notice that this person doesn't have a black face.  No.  Did you know that she was one of our secret weapons?  I don't know her. 
[00:29:00]  Or he.  Or it.  Spy.  Mm-hmm.  Sure.  So, anyway.  So, he goes on the air and just makes a complete fool of himself.  And now the tape is all over the industry.  And, uh...  And Ben's getting text messages all over the country from...  From, uh...  DJs we used to compete against.  They love it.  They all love it.  Because it's so funny.  It's...  It's just...  It's something you just do not do.  And the best...  You don't do it as a jock.  Never mind as the boss of the jocks.  And the best part...  Howard wanted to play this audio and he was told not to.  Oh.  Are you kidding? 
[00:29:30]  Sure.  No, that's right.  That's bad.  That's definitely true.  Of course he was told not to.  It's the same company.  It's like company politics comes into play.  Can't make him look silly.  Silly.  So, anyway.  Then, um...  We did...  We played the tape Friday.  And then, uh...  The message boards and the websites went nuts.  And the New York Post went nuts.  Our old pal John Minnelli wrote a pretty funny article about the whole thing.  Um...  On page three of the post.  I guess this was, uh...  Saturday.  They have Frankie Blue, a picture of him. 
[00:30:00]  And then underneath it says,  Drops Radio F-bomb?  Um...  Mmm...  And then, uh...  The headline is,  Blotto Big Trots Out Blue Material.  Blue Material.  Excuse me.  Blotto Big Trots Out Blue Material.  Blotto Big.  So, he's Blotto, which is drunk.  He's a bigwig.  Right.  So, Blotto Big.  Okay, got it.  Trots Out Blue Material.  Got it.  Okay.  Uh...  And, uh...  The article, uh...  Reads as follows.  Radio Program Director Frankie Blue, apparently under the influence after an office Christmas party, 
[00:30:30]  grabbed the mic during a late-night show on 102.7 WNEW this week, and may have gone off-color.  Ooh.  Bounce WNEW shock jocks Opie and Anthony reported the incident with Great Relish.  Relish?  We...  What?  Rel...  Great Relish.  Great Relish on their XM Satellite radio show yesterday as they played a tape of Blue's  slurring, unscheduled Wednesday night on-air appearance on DJ Yvonne Velasquez's show.  But the big question is whether Blue, who had attended WNEW's Christmas bash that afternoon, 
[00:31:00]  uttered the F word.  I cannot believe that the Post had to write this.  I love it.  Listen to what he goes on.  During four rambling minutes at the mic, Blue, the legendary urban radio programmer hired last  July to kickstart the long-struggling WNEW, repeatedly promoted a station-sponsored $50,000  contest, muffing his words and mixing up the station's name.  The highlight, as far as Opie and Anthony were concerned, came when a seemingly blotto 
[00:31:30]  blue said, station stars Rick, RuPaul, and Kim would pick out a winner, and then they're  going to fuck the winner.  But of course he has to write F and then, you know, dash, dash, dash.  Right.  But basically he writes, pick out a winner, and then they're going to fuck the winner.  We don't know what he said there.  We're not really sure.  It was all mixed up, and we couldn't figure out, nothing made sense.  Right.  All right, so...  It did kind of sound like that's what he meant.  Opie and Anthony weren't sure just what the F word was, but they had a lot of fun speculating  and delighting in the decline of the station that booted them over two years ago after 
[00:32:00]  they broadcast a couple having sex in St. Pat's Cathedral.  The station's been in the toilet since we left, said a gleeful Greg Opie Hughes.  Blue was not at work yesterday and did not return a call for comment from the Post.  Yeah.  And I hear he's on a previously scheduled vacation.  Right, right.  Like all of a sudden, I love how they pull out those vacations.  Oh, this has been scheduled for quite some time. 
[00:32:30]  It was scheduled right when he cracked that mic, cocked.  Well, we're the only, we're pretty much one of the only live radio shows in America today.  Yeah, everybody goes on vacation.  Most of the high profile guys, you know, take the next two weeks off.  They take their vacation.  Did you know you're in the Daily News today as well?  No.  Well, sort of, yeah, I guess.  I didn't get to read it yet.  I'm not going to read the whole article.  No, I did know because we were talking about Hinkley.  Yes.  Oh, and a pounce on tape.  This makes you look like such gloating tools.  We are gloating tools. 
[00:33:00]  Proud of it.  My favorite line here at the end of the whole article is this.  When he was hired, Blue said, it's a marathon, not a sprint, to explain why N.E.W. is in 22nd place in the summer ratings.  Shit house.  It's been a long marathon.  A couple of years long.  Oof.  It's a marathon, not a sprint.  Well, as soon as they get rid of John Sykes, they'll be able to, you know, right the ships that went horribly wrong after we got the boot.  You think so?  Yeah, definitely.  John Sykes had no business running the radio division of Infinity Broadcasting. 
[00:33:30]  Too much politics.  Everyone knows that.  Too much politics going on in that company.  It's very hard for them to fix a station because they don't want to make any waves and hurt any of their other properties in the city.  When companies used to only own one, like, station in a city, one rock station, one country station, their competition, they would do whatever it took to wreck the competition.  But now their competition is owned by the same company.  So they can't, you know, go to sports because they'll step on the fans' toes. 
[00:34:00]  They can't do rock because they'll step on K-Rock's toes.  So it sits there.  They ought to just sell it.  Sell the goddamn thing.  Let some competing company pick it up and go from there.  Yeah, you're right.  It's an awful, awful situation.  And for over two years now, it's been in the toilet as a gleeful.  Greg Opie Hughes was saying.  Very gleeful.  Gleeful.  I don't mean to address this with relish. 
[00:34:30]  Here's your mustard.  I know.  What is that?  Minnelli pulling out his thesaurus.  Well, Minnelli better get his pen out today because what is happening today will make your little Frankie Blue story a little silly.  You better reserve page three for tomorrow, boys.  It's just the beginning, folks.  It is just the beginning.  So we have the Frankie Blue tape.  We've got to play it again.  Now we've got to play it.  Because now this is becoming a thing.  It's becoming a thing.  And there's people out there that are, they want a recording of this to pass along to other people in the business. 
[00:35:00]  I think some people were saying that he just sounded nervous.  Oh, that's what the Daily News.  Yeah.  Here, give me that.  Nervous?  Yeah, Hinkley is tired or something.  Yeah, Hinkley's trying to, I don't know what Hinkley's doing.  Maybe Hinkley's buddies with him or something.  Or he's quoting someone who said he sounded nervous.  Yeah.  Sounded nervous?  Is that how you spin this?  When you're nervous.  All right, you know what?  We should read some of this Hinkley thing.  It is pretty funny, too.  So this is in today's paper.  O&A pounce on tape, a brief blue air shift.  Thanks largely. 
[00:35:30]  Basically, he wants to say, because of those assholes, Opie and Anthony.  But he writes, thanks largely to Opie and Anthony of XM Satellite Radio.  The hottest radio mixtape now is WNEW program director Frankie Blue's filling in on his own station last Wednesday.  Blue spun music and plugged to NW's $50,000 redo contest, during which at one point he referred to his station as KTU, WNEW's dance music rival.  Blue was KTU's program director from 1996 to 2003. 
[00:36:00]  All right.  He also spoke a semi-garbled word O&A said was the F word, though not everyone agreed.  O&A joked about Blue, but mostly teed off on NW where they were stars until they were kicked off the air and kept out of radio for two years,  following the Sex and St. Pat's incident of August 2002.  As for exactly what happened Wednesday, sources at NW say Blue had a disagreement with night host Yvonne Velasquez  and decided apparently on impulse to take her APM shift himself.  He's like, I don't need that cunt.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:36:30]  What language?  You've got to think he was thinking that in his head.  I'm sorry.  Get all those curses out today.  Get it out of your system.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, we better get all the curses out today.  Get it out of your system.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da.  Okay, so he decides to do the shift.  The WNEW Christmas party was held that afternoon ending at four.  So it ends at four.  He goes on the air at eight.  Right.  He's not going right back to the station.  A couple more drinks maybe at the bar.  That's what I'm thinking.  That's what I'm thinking. 
[00:37:00]  I'm thinking more than drinks, but I don't know.  You don't think maybe he took a nap?  No, no, no, no.  Ending at four.  And ONA suggested it sounds as if Blue was drinking.  Others think he mostly sounded nervous.  Who's thinking that he sounds nervous and he's not drunk on this tape?  When you're nervous, you speak quickly.  Or under the influence.  You speak too quickly.  And your mind is racing.  Right.  It's not like slurring, slow motion.  I'm so nervous. 
[00:37:30]  I can't believe it.  It's not nerves.  No, no, no.  Others think he mostly sounded nervous.  Speaking too fast.  Repeating himself and running sentences.  He wasn't speaking too fast.  No, he was slurring.  I don't think Hinkley heard this tape yet.  Speaking too fast.  Repeating himself and running sentences together.  Rather than say slurring words or rambling.  What?  What did you hear?  What a tool.  He left the air after about a half hour.  That's because of Earl, right?  I think Earl actually called the general manager. 
[00:38:00]  That's what I'm hearing now.  Ben, you want to keep Earl totally out of it?  Did Earl call the GM?  I actually believe Earl didn't call.  Oh, really?  I believe other people came back from the party or wherever.  Yeah, people noticed that.  Oh, my God.  This guy is completely out of it and should not be on the air.  So they started calling the general manager.  Because this isn't some dopey DJ that you're paying like seven bucks an hour that you would  fire like immediately.  Like, all right, there you go.  You blew your chance.  It's the boss.  The star PD that they brought on board.  So there's phone calls being made and then the general manager has to uncomfortably go 
[00:38:30]  into the studio and take the boss off the air.  That's supposed to be responsible for everything that you hear on the air.  The walk out to the mound.  Give me the ball.  Get out.  He left.  Program director?  Yeah.  I can see Earl doing nothing.  He left the air after about a half hour, leaving a bizarre tape that shows why he made his  reputation off the air and not on.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  A spokeswoman for Infinity, which owns NAW, said the company had no statement. 
[00:39:00]  There were unofficial reports.  Report station officials reprimanded Blue, but no indication whether there could be any  further repercussions.  Okay?  Blue, who is starting a previously scheduled vacation today, could not be reached for comment.  In the Arctic Circle.  And then it goes on to say how he was hired, you know, in the summer to turn the station  around.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Yeah, another guy hired to turn that piece of shit station around.  How embarrassing.  I mean, the last time a PD went on NAW, all you heard was...  Dude. 
[00:39:30]  What?  Oh, wow.  Why are you holding that grudge, though?  No grudge.  It's a lousy $50,000.  That's all.  That's all you lost.  No big deal.  All right.  Whew.  Whew.  I believe that station is cursed.  It is.  I think it's the ONA curse.  It's going to haunt them for a few more years.  I guarantee it.  Until our voice is once again heard coming out of that station, it will remain cursed.  Is that part of the big secret today, Anthony? 
[00:40:00]  I don't know where this will lead.  I'll be quite honest with you.  Yeah, today's going to lead to some really big things, though.  That's for sure.  Big things.  You just watched.  Big things.  All right.  So here's Frankie Blue.  Let's listen to him.  I love this song.  That's someone speaking really fast.  That's him being nervous.  In my opinion, that's a guy on lewds.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  That's...  Give me another.  Give me another goddamn drink.  Wow.  It's snowing here in New York.  Oh, I'm so nervous.  I'm wracked with nerves.  Hinkly.  Uh-huh.  I love this song.  Nelly featuring Tim McGraw. 
[00:41:00]  Does everyone understand, like...  You guys hammered.  You listen to...  Everyone listens to their hometown radio stations.  Do you understand what station this is?  This is the type of station where you have to be like, WKTU, it's time of summer, everybody.  Hey!  I love this song.  Crank it up, or whatever.  It's that type of delivery.  And he's like, we're going to be disco dancing all weekend long.  Yeah, they like that crap.  He sounds like a jock from, like, the mid-70s that smoked a lot of pot before he went on  the air.  That's not the delivery that you want when you're playing dance music. 
[00:41:30]  No, that's like...  That should come right after, uh...  Hey, you just heard the entire album Dark Side of the Moon.  Right.  Been sitting here smoking a lot of pot.  Right.  Not the disco station.  You shouldn't have the Bob Ross delivery when you're playing disco music.  We're going to paint a happy little tree right here.  Coming up is a double shot of Donna Summers.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  He's talking to the music.  I love this song. 
[00:42:00]  Nelly featuring Tim McGraw.  This is Frankie Blue.  Now, you know, for the last several weeks, we've been, um, giving you a chance to win $50,000  in cash in the Mix 1027 redo and plus win a Toyota Scion.  And I think that is going to happen tomorrow morning. 
[00:42:30]  Tomorrow morning at 8 a.m., Ricky, RuPaul, Kim will pick a winner and go to that winner's  house, like, publishing clearance.  Or whether it's a house or it's a job.  We're coming to you, baby.  We're going to find you.  And we're going to reward you with $50,000 in a brand new Toyota. 
[00:43:00]  And, um, I don't, I don't see how you can not be happy about that.  This is Frankie Blue.  Um, so make sure you're listening tomorrow about 8 a.m.  Um, 50 grand prize winner.  50 grand prize winner.  What is he trying to say there?  He's saying 50 grand prize winner.  Now, is it 50 grand prize winner? 
[00:43:30]  Like, you win $50,000?  Right.  50 grand prize winner.  But he's saying it like, we have 50, like 50 people.  That are going to win a grand each.  50, or whatever, not even win a grand each, but 50 people will win the grand prize.  That's how he's reading it.  Oh, okay.  50 grand prize winner.  He has no idea what he's talking about.  And this is the boss.  A.M.  Um, 50 grand prize winner.  50 grand prize winner. 
[00:44:00]  That's right.  50 grand prize winner.  Of the redo contest.  Of the winner of the Toyota.  What?  Scion.  Come on, baby.  You know you want it.  If you have qualified in the past several weeks, we're going to pick the winner tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.  RuPaul's going to dip his big old hands in there, pick the winner, and we're going to fine you. 
[00:44:30]  And I don't care if it takes all day, it's worth the $50,000 in the car.  All right?  We have the armored truck.  We've got the party patrol vans.  We've got the car.  We've got everything.  And I'm going to drive it.  We've got the best music in town, so why don't you give me a call?  This is Frankie Blue for Yvonne Velasquez.  And telephone number is, if you want to make a request, is 1-877-MIX-1027. 
[00:45:00]  So give me a call.  Okay, baby?  She must have been laughing her ass off driving home listening to that.  Chances are you're sitting in traffic.  Like, she gets thrown off the air by this guy, hops in her car to drive home, and tunes this in.  Would you not be just laughing your ass off because that's like sweet justice?  Definitely.  This tool throws you out for the day or for the night, and he's bombed on the air? 
[00:45:30]  Let's give some free advice to our old radio company.  You want to turn that station around?  Freaking make Frankie Blue drink every afternoon.  Oh, yeah.  Throw some Mickeys in his drinks and some freaking lewds and throw this guy on the air every day during afternoon drive.  But who's not tuning in?  Who wouldn't listen to that?  I'd be listening.  You'd have to.  The guy is entertaining as hell drunk.  He'd be like Howard Beale.  People would just tune in to hear what he had to say on a daily basis. 
[00:46:00]  Network?  Very good.  I got the name.  Very good.  So here's the last part of the tape.  It's just another minute.  And then they finally had to yank him off the air.  This is the best part because we're not sure if he says fuck.  I think he does try to say fine, then he messed it up.  He says the wrong call letters.  And then he says the wrong call letters as well, which is just the hugest no-no in the radio business.  Mix 1027. 
[00:46:30]  The new Mix 1027.  This is Frankie Blue.  And I am so excited for tomorrow.  Look at that.  That can't control himself.  He's just enjoying this.  This is just too funny for me because it's a radio.  When we did this, I was like, it's not that big of a deal, but I guess it is because everyone's writing about it.  I mean, not only are the New York papers all over this thing.  It's all over the, you know, in the radio world.  It's a big thing.  The other thing, back to that $50,000 thing, the grand man.  He probably, yeah. 
[00:47:00]  He probably wrote that copy, too.  Yeah.  You know, he's the program director, so he probably wrote the copy.  He doesn't even know how to read the copy.  Who wrote this crap, baby?  Hey, coming to get you, baby.  Oh, goochie, goochie, goochie.  Just leave him on, hammered.  Oh, yeah.  And I am so excited for tomorrow.  I got Ricky.  Tomorrow.  That's the Boston Brooks.  That's the beer burp. 
[00:47:30]  Tomorrow.  I forgot about the beer burp.  This is Frankie Blue, and I am so excited for tomorrow.  I got Ricky and Rue coming in in the morning, putting a hand in the big old barrel and picking  out a $50,000 grand prize winner.  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo Contest. 
[00:48:00]  And also, you win a Toyota Scion.  The KTU.  Now, what's going to happen is they're going to pull, they're going to put their hand in  the barrel, they're going to pick out a winner, and then they're going to fight that winner.  And that winner will be rewarded with everything.  Now, I think you said fucking it.  They're going to fight that winner.  I was ready to, like, give him the credit, because I've been listening to the copy, you 
[00:48:30]  know, and he says fine at that point.  Yeah.  But I think he just lost his mind, because that doesn't sound anywhere near fine.  Fine.  It sounds more like the F word than it does fine.  Right.  There's definitely a...  Ah!  Yeah.  They're going to fight that winner.  And that winner will be rewarded with everything.  He's just nervous.  Mix 102.7, Frankie Blue.  What's happening?  What's happening?  Stepping on the vocals.  Mix one of us, Frankie Blue. 
[00:49:00]  What's happening, baby?  Did he, uh...  I forgot...  Where was the part where he said KTU?  Oh, I went by Anthony Cummins.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  What's happening, baby?  I was too busy with the whole...  The winner.  Are we off the air?  Hey, Earl, you black bastard.  Get me a drink.  Okay.  Okay.  Blue, you're my boy!  Yeah, Blue, you're our boy today.  Good old Blue.  You're my boy, Blue!  Thank you, baby.  Thank you, baby.  Blue, you're my boy! 
[00:49:30]  It's Frankie Blue.  At Sirius XM Satellite XKTM.  It just makes it...  It's just even funnier, because he's the boss.  He's supposed to be the responsible one.  Yeah.  Every radio station is filled with a bunch of drunks, drug addicts, wife beaters.  Every radio station has at least one or two problems.  Alcoholics!  Right, but the boss is supposed to be the responsible one, you know? 
[00:50:00]  Keeping everyone in line, as they say, Anthony.  Aren't we supposed to get that tape of that tirade that that woman did in Oklahoma City?  We're going to get that next, right?  Yeah.  That's hysterical.  Some woman was really pissed off at the two guys that she does a show with.  She came in in the morning before everybody else, went in the studio, she was allegedly  drunk, and cracked the mics and just started calling the F word and throwing around all  kinds of words that are not allowed on the public airwaves. 
[00:50:30]  The rest of the morning show, the bosses, the radio station just lost her mind.  All drunk.  What for it did she say?  Was it typical of what a woman gets a problem with when guys are around, they're having fun  and she hates it?  Yeah, pretty much.  That happens a lot, especially on radio shows.  If there's a woman involved in the show, she hates the guys that she works with.  It's just the way it works.  Yeah, I mean, the business is filled with women that have sued their male co-hosts.  I mean, a lot of them.  Not just a couple.  When they have a falling out, they go right to a lawyer and right to a sexual harassment 
[00:51:00]  sued, and it just gets ugly.  There's a few out there I can name, but...  Overall, like content and stuff, right?  I didn't want to have to come into work and deal with that type of content.  Every day, I had to go in and hear these guys talking about the...  Yeah, all of a sudden...  You signed on.  You signed the checks, didn't you?  Yeah, all of a sudden, like if there's a stripper in the studio doing what strippers  do for morning shows or whatever, all of a sudden, she has a problem with that.  Of course.  And then they're in hell.  One of my really good friends in the business went through literally two or three years of 
[00:51:30]  hell because one of his co-hosts...  Mark Perenna?  No.  No.  He said one of your pals.  No, no, no.  Don't start that.  No, Perenna's just a grease man.  So, uh...  No wonder I dragged these bitches behind trucks, eh?  What a doodle.  The funny thing is, over the years, program directors have tried to get...  Excuse me.  To get us to hire a woman.  Yep.  I think it would add something to the program.  Yeah.  You guys would be a little more mainstream.  You could maybe get bigger in the business if you had, like, that female point of view. 
[00:52:00]  Yes, the woman's point of view, and it would keep you guys in check a little bit.  We're like, are you insane?  See, that's what you need in the middle of a funny, edgy bit is some stupid female voice  going, oh, you!  You know how they get, like, that, like, phony exasperation?  Oh, gosh.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  No!  Don't go there.  Ugh.  Stop.  Fun killers.  Yeah.  All right.  We should break.  Yeah.  All righty. 
[00:52:30]  We should talk about our meeting on Friday.  What a fun meeting that was.  Did you carry your wine home?  Oh, yeah.  I carried my wine home.  What did Jimmy do with his wine?  Because he doesn't drink.  Well, why don't we...  I have to eat.  All right.  Well, I mean, we're not teasing.  I just got to eat.  That's a tease.  That'll keep people...  But then we don't have to tease on satellite radio.  Are you going to gleefully eat that cement?  You're going to eat that with relish, are you?  Oh, the high-protein crunch.  I was looking at that box, and I went to pick it up, and it weighs a ton.  I know.  It's like a brick.  It just sits there. 
[00:53:00]  They give you a...  It's a box with a brick in it, and they give you a little sledgehammer, so you can break  it into little pieces.  You can chip off a few flakes.  That you can throw in a bowl with some milk.  Why don't you just spread your cheeks, and I'll put a little spackle in there.  That's what's going to happen again.  Back them all up.  This was the cereal that caused the last backup, so I don't know why I brought this in today.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Another secret message going out.  Really?  Some of the people on the instant feedback.  You guys, I mean, we'll get into it in a little bit, but something is spreading like wildfire. 
[00:53:30]  Like wildfire.  I got something in my throat.  Oh.  Oh, eat some of that cereal.  I know.  It'll scrape out whatever's in there.  It's like a rock tumbler in your mouth.  Ben, you might want to wake up John Minnelli.  I think he's going to want to talk to us today.  Stop the presses.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  There's going to be one very pissed off person today.  Just the beginning, folks.  And he's on vacation. 
[00:54:00]  Oh.  Doesn't that suck, dude?  You go on vacation, and then all of a sudden you're called back from vacation.  Or you get the phone calls while you're in the middle of, I don't know, the Caribbean or something.  And you've got to deal with two assholes from New York.  Oh.  Again.  That's got to stink.  You work so hard to go on vacation.  Mm-hmm.  Everyone's speculating.  What's going to happen?  Hmm.  What's going to happen?  Who's going to fill certain voids in this world? 
[00:54:30]  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  People of a slowly but surely are getting the word, right?  They're getting the word.  They're getting our secret messages.  How do they figure it out, though?  I don't know.  Probably on the net.  On the net?  People blogged. 
[00:55:00]  Yes.  Some people checking in on the blogs.  No, no.  Someone's blogging.  It's very early on.  We just kind of lit the match.  And now there's just a little pile of leaves burning right now.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  A little pile of leaves burning.  And you're crumbling paper to throw on that fire, right?  That's supposed to be the crackle of leaves?  Yeah, this is like old-time radio.  This was fire in the old days.  I think you need, like, plastic.  Oh, wow.  And now, look, the fire jumped from the pile of leaves, and now it's... 
[00:55:30]  Oh, look at that little tree.  The bark in that little tree is now on fire.  Oh, boy.  And it's slowly going up that little tree.  Hmm.  By 10 o'clock, it's going to be a raging forest fire.  An inferno.  A raging forest fire.  Mm-hmm.  Can we take a long break so I can eat some cereal?  Want to play something in?  I should have.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. Life.  I'd like to give a fuck you to Tony and Dan, you shit mule, for still not opening up the message board, you bitch. 
[00:56:00]  I'd like to give a fuck you to that hawk if you don't come over and shit on Jimmy's fucking chest.  He loves it warm.  I'd like to leave a big fuck you to all the jerk off New Jersey fucking drivers that gotta come over into Pennsylvania and fuck up our roads.  The only thing worse than New Jersey fucks are kinks.  Fuck all you.  Fuck you.  And fuck the blue state.  I'm giving a big fuck you to Piz.  Piz, get off your knees.  Stop sucking off the fucking bars. 
[00:56:30]  You fucking big socket.  I'd like to give a big F.U. to my fucking co-workers who can't seem to listen to anything but, like, lumped pussy-ass rocks.  Fuck you.  I'd like to leave a big F.U. to my friend Matt, who's a trucker who rolls oversized loads out in the Midwest.  Stop locking up the fucking loads, you shit dicks.  And the next time I buy a concert ticket for you, you better show up.  Three strikes, you're out.  Later, cool.  Yeah, I won't leave a big fuck you to my ex-wife and a guy I work with that's been fucking my ex-wife while I was working. 
[00:57:00]  Fuck you, rabbit.  You scumbag motherfucker.  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck you, Brian!  Brian!  Brian!  You're going to be right here, I'm crying!  Woo!  Fuck you, yo!  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE1.  1-866-FU-LINE1. 
[00:57:30]  Well, fuck you very much.  On the Opie and Anthony show, we're going to make fun of people with Down Syndrome.  I just didn't want to be in the middle of the flight and have him yank that handle hoping candy comes out and blow the door off the plane.  We all get sucked out except for him because his head gets stuck.  We all get sucked out except for him because his head gets stuck.  The Opie and Anthony Ato.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  We all get booty on.  Amanda C.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. line in.  Welcome home!  Go back!  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:58:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Yeah!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Merry Christmas.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  You're the only ones working on Radio Opie. 
[00:58:30]  I know.  Jesus.  Are we motivated or what?  Highly motivated.  Well, we had enough time off, I think.  We needed to get fired because we really were calling it in at the end there.  Yeah, we kind of were.  You know that your old pals, Opie and Anthony, would take like three weeks off around the holidays?  I know.  We pretty much did like three weeks of vacation from Christmas all the way into the New Year.  Yeah, boss, we need the week before Christmas because it's the week before.  No one really does anything. 
[00:59:00]  It's not going to affect our ratings.  Well, we ran the station, basically, and the boss would have to finally call us on vacation and go,  Um, guys?  Hey, what's up, boss?  Hey, how you been?  Uh, guys, it's, um, it's January 10th.  Um, are you guys coming back anytime soon?  Yeah, we'll be back.  God, give us to the 15th.  Yeah, it's Tuesday, so we figured we'd just take the rest of the week.  Right.  Because it's already, you know, most of the week is shot, you know, Monday.  So we figured we'd take the rest of the week and we'd come in next Monday. 
[00:59:30]  We really, really just needed to get fired.  We were getting so lazy.  Is there a reason I have to bite into a Dirk Diggler banana?  Banana that they got me here?  It's the fattest, longest banana.  Not only that, you got the G-spot banana.  I know, I got the, it's curved.  It's curved perfectly for her pleasure.  Do you want to kiss me?  I hate it.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, you're so stupid, so stupid. 
[01:00:00]  You like my car?  Can I just kiss you?  You like my car?  I just got it painted.  Can I paint it the same color?  Same color.  I just saw that over the weekend.  It was great.  Boogie Nights.  Boogie Nights is a great movie.  Heather Graham, full frontal.  Mm-hmm.  Quick shot.  It was nice.  Roller girl.  Always nice, always nice.  Funny-ass movie, man.  Nina Hartley, catching a bullet.  Yes.  Very good.  Just because I made out with Nina in a movie once.  Oh.  It's a short comedy I did.  Me and Nina get to make out at the end.  Oh, that's right.  It was the, um, um, American Dummy. 
[01:00:30]  I love that movie.  Yeah, you could get that movie up online now, right?  Yeah.  I think, uh, eatabullet.com can order it from.  Oh, really?  I wasn't even trying to plug.  I just, so, yeah, so we're, uh, pretty much the only high-profile DJs, uh, in America right  now working.  Everyone else takes this whole week off.  Yeah.  And then, uh, you know, takes some time for New Year's.  And we were, we used to be like that, but now that we're trying to make the biggest  comeback in radio history, you know, we understand we've got to do some things.  You've got to work a little harder when you've been there. 
[01:01:00]  You've got to work a little harder.  We can't get, we can't be as lazy as we were.  You've been kicked down a few notches.  You're trying to climb back up.  You can't stop.  I think we're pretty much working the whole week.  We might, what, are we taking Friday off, maybe?  Friday's Christmas Eve.  Yeah, we're taking Christmas Eve off.  Oh, Friday's Christmas Eve, all right.  But we're working up until, what, Thursday?  I thought we were taking Thursday and Friday this week.  That's what I thought.  That's next week, genius.  No, but both weeks.  No, we're going all the way to Thursday.  If you don't want to be here Thursday, if you're not as motivated as Anne and I, then  you go have fun. 
[01:01:30]  Good.  See you.  I just know that I will be starting my Christmas shopping on Friday.  I'm not even kidding, man.  I haven't done anything.  I haven't done anything.  I'm going, I'm really going the gift card thing.  Gift cards.  I'm thinking, yeah.  Because even that, you have to wait in that long line, that back and forth.  No, I'm not even talking that.  I'm thinking just cold, hard cash. 
[01:02:00]  A couple of people are going to get cash, like some of the kids in the family.  You know, they're in their teens and stuff.  They love the cash.  Right.  So you slap them with the cash.  Right.  They buy whatever they want.  But I gave up this year.  I really gave up.  My girlfriend was like, you know, every, for the past few weeks, has been saying, look,  we've got to do something here.  We've done no Christmas shopping.  She said, yeah, I know, but I don't know what to do.  And then all of a sudden, she finds these, like American Express, does this thing where 
[01:02:30]  they give a gift card.  It's like a credit card.  Yeah.  They can go into any store and use it anywhere.  It's not like you've got to go to the store and buy it.  So now they're used anywhere.  It's the most unthoughtful gift you can possibly give.  How do I do that?  Call up Amex.  That's a great gift.  And it says as the name, the name is Happy Holidays.  Happy Holidays here, and I would like to make a purchase.  And it works like a credit card, so you don't have to go to the store, because I hate those  store gift certificates.  Oh, great.  You got me a gift certificate, dispenser gifts. 
[01:03:00]  I'll get that lava lamp I've been drooling over.  And what it comes down to, no one wants the personal touch anymore.  If you give enough cash in a stupid Christmas car and go, here, that's all they want.  Believe me, they're not going to go, I really wish you put more thought into that and got  me a sweater.  Yeah, I was going to say, I really wish you'd try to pick out a sweater for me.  And last year was the ultimate for the family, because I could not, it took so much thought  to get everybody things.  Because you're thinking, what am I going to get this guy?  He's got whatever he needs. 
[01:03:30]  I can't really think of it.  And you're going through the store, and you just kind of settle on something.  Screw it.  Here you go.  Buy something nice for yourself.  Here's your little gift card.  Love your grandson, Frank.  But, you know, Christmas is for the young.  The older you get, you just start really hating it and counting down the days when Christmas  is over and you can just move on with your life.  But when you're a kid, you're counting down the days like, oh, Santa's coming.  Remember how long it used to take from the beginning of December until Christmas Day? 
[01:04:00]  Right.  From the 1st until the 25th, it was a year of a kid's life.  It would take forever.  And now it's like, it's the fuck, what the hell happened?  It's the 20, 20, what?  I got to go shopping.  You go crazy.  Yeah.  That's why years whiz by as you get older.  As a kid, you're constantly looking forward to stuff.  So it slows down time, right?  So it takes longer.  It seems like it takes longer.  And then as an adult, you're constantly trying to put crap off, like bills and garbage you 
[01:04:30]  got to do.  So it comes up on you really quick.  Maybe we could all go out and play Kick the Can.  That's why...  We could be young again.  Oh, what's...  Oh, that's Catman Crothers?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's...  Cocoon.  No, it was Twilight Zone.  Oh, that's right.  It was Twilight Zone.  The movie.  You like Kick the Can, Doc?  Always.  Probably.  We played a game called Shine. 
[01:05:00]  Right, y'all.  Wrong film.  So we...  Wow.  That wasn't a secret signal either.  So that's why we like to wreck Christmas.  We're going to play this really fast so I can get a little more cereal down.  And then we'll talk about the free meeting that might lead into what's going on today.  Oh, good.  I could deep throat my banana during the break.  I'm breaking this up into small pieces and putting it on a napkin because I'm not shoving  this in my mouth.  It's the most embarrassing thing for a man to eat, besides an actual dick, is a banana. 
[01:05:30]  Because people watch and it's like you've got to open your mouth.  Oh, shove it in there.  And being guys, you know, when someone has a banana, everyone's looking like, I wonder  if he's going to try to eat it, like, holding, like, the bottom of it.  Yeah, how much of it is he going to bite off at one time?  Right.  Is he going to cup the bottom of it and jiggle him a little?  It's a banana, or as I like to call it, a dick without the delicious payoff.  But you don't want to eat a banana in public, especially when this giant, Johnny the Holmes 
[01:06:00]  banana...  Be funny, you open it and it's black.  You really think that...  A little skin over the tip of it.  Oh, stop it.  You really think that banana's giant?  Isn't it big for a banana, I mean?  You know, for me, it's nothing, but what you're saying...  Dude, you were bragging that yours is as big as a Foster's can in the bathroom on Friday.  Oh.  Look at everyone.  I'm just going to push the back of my head onto it. 
[01:06:30]  Anthony has peeled his banana and now we can't do the radio show.  We want to see his technique for eating that freaking thing.  There he goes.  He's cutting it into...  I'm breaking it into small pieces and laying it on a paper towel that I will now...  Oh, that is a delicious banana.  You just took the fun out of it.  Yes, I did.  How am I supposed to whack my bag looking at this?  I am not.  I diffuse the situation.  All right.  You bastards. 
[01:07:00]  It's a quick two-minute prank call and then we'll continue.  Got to talk about the free meeting.  Hair in my throat.  Huh?  That happened.  Yeah, I was just listening to your station a little while ago.  Yeah.  And I had my three-year-old son with me.  And you guys were putting down the Santa Claus thing.  And, oh, it's just your parents and all that.  Yeah.  And, you know, I was...  I love Opie and Anthony.  You know?  And I'm a faithful listener.  But I had to change the station. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, that's okay.  You're doing parenting, that's called, when you change the station.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, I detect that you're a little pissed at us because we just said that there's no Santa Claus on the air.  Well, it'd be one thing if it was, you know, a little later at night and there wouldn't happen to have been someone's kid listening, you know?  Dude, I'd just save you the hassle.  Now you could get the credit for all those presents you bought for him.  Did we traumatize him?  No, you didn't, actually.  I changed the station in time where he didn't pick up on it because he was busy doing something else.  Hey, what's your son's name? 
[01:08:00]  It's Jeffrey.  Can I talk to him real fast?  Why?  What are you going to say?  I just wanted to say hi to him.  You're not going to say anything bad, are you?  Oh, I wouldn't do that.  Yeah, are you sure?  Yeah.  I hope not.  All right, where's Jeffrey?  I'll get him.  He don't really talk much on the phone.  What's your wife saying in the background?  Oh, she wasn't too happy about it when I told her.  She wasn't listening, but wait, wait, wait.  Barb, chill out.  Oh, I don't.  Okay, hey, Jeffrey, somebody wants to talk to you on the phone, those guys we were listening to on the radio? 
[01:08:30]  I measure the floor first.  He's got a measuring tape.  He said he's measuring the floor first.  And your wife is mad at me for doing that?  Oh, I better talk to him and then smooth it over.  Okay, well, here he is, okay?  I'll give him the phone, but I don't know if he'll talk.  All right.  Okay, here he is.  Here, Jeffrey, listen.  Listen to this guy on the radio.  He wants to talk to you.  Here.  Jeffrey, take it.  Come here.  Come here.  Wait, let me get him on my lap. 
[01:09:00]  Jeffrey, come here.  Come here.  Just listen to what this guy has to say to you.  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  That's your dad.  No.  She said there's no way here.  You have to wait.  No.  Heartless.  There you have it.  Little Jeffrey.  What's he, 30 now?  Yeah, that happened a long time ago.  You can't hate me for that anymore.  Right?  Well, some people can.  Really?  Sure. 
[01:09:30]  All right, we're trying to figure out if Operation Phoenix is going down today or not.  Operation Phoenix?  It's Operation Phoenix.  Wow.  It's the rising of the Phoenix.  Operation Mongoose.  It's almost like that movie.  We crashed our plane.  That was the Opie and Anthony show.  Mm-hmm.  And now we're taking remnants of it to build a new plane.  That's right.  Fly back.  Yeah, and today's remnant, it's just a little piece of the plane.  It's just a tiny little piece.  But you just watch how this grows and festers.  I watched the original with Jimmy Stewart over the weekend. 
[01:10:00]  I love that when a movie comes out and then they've got to play the original and watch it.  And all I kept doing was, you've got to keep your chin up.  We're going to turn this thing around.  I can't find that.  I know.  That was such a funny goddamn bit.  We're rebuilding the show every week and that's one thing I still haven't been able to find.  That's part of the show that has to stay in the desert.  Yeah, I guess.  As we lift off in the plane that we built.  I guess.  So, all hell is breaking loose, but we don't have any details.  Yeah, we need details.  We do need details. 
[01:10:30]  But I guess we could seg into our Fareed meeting on Friday.  Fareed.  Which pretty much started this whole thing.  Stop wasting.  We're not wasting your time, bro.  We don't know.  We don't know if it's going down officially.  This isn't a tease, Jim.  I didn't say it was.  Stop wasting time.  You don't have to stretch anything out anymore.  Remember, we now pay for the show.  It's not regular radio.  We just don't want to look like dicks just in case there was some kind of problem today. 
[01:11:00]  Go have a cheesesteak, Jim.  Oh, easy on him.  No reason to hit that hard.  And Eric and everybody else is running around like lunatics trying to figure out if it's  going down or not.  And if it is going down, it's going to be a huge story today.  It's going to be a massive story, and a lot of people are going to be really pissed off.  It is going down.  We just don't know if it's going down today.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  So, after the show Friday, we went and met with our old pal, Fareed.  Fareed.  Fareed.  And we sat in a conference room, I believe on the 44th floor overlooking all of Manhattan 
[01:11:30]  and Central Park and the 59th Street Bridge.  It was very nice how each of us were commenting on how we bashed each other in the newspaper  and on the radio.  That was nice.  That was a nice, uncomfortable moment.  Well, you know what?  I used to think that you could actually make friends in this business, stupid me.  Yeah.  Stupid me.  I mean, they're friends with you until they don't need you anymore, and then they kick  you out the door, and they forget they ever met you. 
[01:12:00]  Until maybe later down the line.  Until down the line, then they need you again.  Right.  Right?  Sure.  And Fareed was, you know, Fareed is a good friend of ours, I guess.  He is.  He's a business guy.  He was kind of bitter that we decided to go back to satellite radio.  You know, it's a fact that he was one of a few people that wanted to throw us back on  commercial radio.  Yeah.  And we just didn't feel like there was anything left in commercial radio for us to do.  Mm-hmm.  But we always said if someone out there could figure out how to take this satellite radio 
[01:12:30]  show and syndicate it back to commercial radio, we would be more than willing to listen.  Right, Anthony?  Open to anything.  Right.  So, Fareed says, hey, guys, why don't you stop by my office?  And so we went to his office on Friday.  Mm-hmm.  And we had ourselves a little sit-down meeting, and we trashed each other.  A little meeting.  Big time.  That was fun.  He's like, hey, what did he say?  He's like, where have you guys been?  No one's talking about you anymore.  Where have you guys been? 
[01:13:00]  No one's talking about you anymore.  Oh, my God.  That's really funny, Fareed.  Yeah.  Ha, ha.  Yeah, we're only in, I don't know, a bunch of articles every single day across America  because we're kind of like the pioneers of this satellite radio thing as far as high-profile  guys go.  Mm-hmm.  You know, yeah, no one's talking about us anymore, sure, okay.  That's his little jab.  Right.  We brought little Jimmy, too.  Yes.  Sat in on the meeting with us.  And they're taking his cell phone numbers and stuff, thinking like you're a real bigwig.  Well, you told the woman, you're like, well, he's like the brains. 
[01:13:30]  Judy.  Judy, yeah, that was the brains behind the whole thing, so they just had no idea what  an idiot they were talking to.  I'm just nodding like, yeah, that's such a good point.  Yeah, oh, because he's the brains behind everything, and Judy looked over at Jim and went like,  oh, yeah.  Oh, can I have your cell number, your home number?  Like, serious, yeah.  Yeah.  My Sabbath shirt, my fat stomach, and she's like, ugh.  She'll call Jim.  Jim will think it's a prostitute calling.  Hi, it's Judy.  Did I get your number from Craigslist?  How much were you?  Three? 
[01:14:00]  Citadel?  How much is that on my chest?  So then I go to Fareed, I'm like, yeah, that was really nice what you had to say about  it, and I, when we decided to sign with Satellite Radio instead of with your company, and he  was like, what was I supposed to say?  What am I supposed to say?  He was like a scorned girlfriend or something.  Defending his properties.  He was all bummed that we didn't sign with him, but our logic, and it's working out, I  do believe, is that, look, we go to XM Satellite Radio, and then we maybe do some commercial  as well on the side.  There you go. 
[01:14:30]  It's a win-win for us, and certainly a win-win for everyone else, right?  Yes.  And it gives people an outlet to voice their dissatisfaction with some people that they  have to deal with now.  Right.  Well.  Because there's some kind of grudge there, man.  Well, let's just be honest.  Fareed hates Howard just as much as we do.  Yeah.  You know, Howard is a complete dick.  Always has been.  It's always been about himself.  He doesn't really care about his listeners.  He doesn't care about putting on an entertaining show anymore, a funny show. 
[01:15:00]  He doesn't give a crap.  He just wants to get his paychecks.  It's all about the half a billion dollars.  Right.  That's what it boils down to with him.  And rumor has it that Fareed left Infinity Broadcast because of Howard.  Yeah.  You know, because Howard was just a complete dick taking personal shots at Fareed and his  kids and things like that.  That's good.  Uh-huh.  One of the guys that helped you get where you are and make you really rich, you know, you're  just completely trash because you don't like some of the things going on.  Yep.  And then run and hide behind Mel. 
[01:15:30]  But then if someone talks about your hot, you know, daughters with their big tits, you  get all pissed off, don't you?  Oh, he certainly does.  Whew.  But it's okay to make fun of everyone else's kids, right?  It was okay to make fun of Brother Wheeze's daughter, right, Howard?  It was okay.  Sure was.  If someone does it to you, you run to Mel, and then Ann and I have to come back from  vacation to get yelled at, and probably should have been fired, but they were too scared  to fire us because then we would have went across the street and competed against you  head-to-head.  Yep.  Remember that, Howard? 
[01:16:00]  Remember?  Ann and I, I was skiing, you were in the Caribbean or something, and we had to cut our vacation  short to meet with Mel Karmazin on like the 88th floor of some fucking building in the  old Manhattan to get yelled and screamed at because you couldn't handle a little abuse.  A little good-natured ribbing.  A little good-natured ribbing.  Remember that?  Yeah.  He'd run and hide behind Mel every time.  Any time the crap hit the fan, there he went, running to Mel Karmazin, and now he's going 
[01:16:30]  to do the same thing.  Those people over there at Sirius don't even have a clue what they're in for over there  with those two.  They don't have a clue.  Two, Howard runs and cries to Mel, Mel kisses his ass, does anything up to firing people  just to keep the boy happy.  No, he'll fire people if they don't have power.  That's what I mean.  Right.  Right up to firing people.  Okay.  Yeah.  Ass.  So, you know, Fareed just dislikes Howard as much as we do just because of all the 
[01:17:00]  little stupid games he plays behind the scenes and then acts like he's this big, tough radio  guy on the air.  Yeah.  Like he'll take on anyone.  Sure, he will.  Sure, he will.  Yeah.  No, he'll take you on behind the scenes with the big bosses.  You know, make sure that certain people like ourselves, it wasn't just us, that, you know,  make sure, you know, there's a gag order.  Don't mention them or you'll get fired. 
[01:17:30]  He fights the people he can beat.  He never, he never confronts the Clubber Langs, the ones that'll kick his ass.  It's just like Rocky 3, isn't it?  Good reference, Clubber Lang.  It is.  They keep him, Mel, Mel keeps Howard guarded.  He doesn't let, yeah.  He puts him against bums.  It'll kill you to pieces, Rock.  So, this high profile meeting went down on Friday. 
[01:18:00]  It's definitely?  Yeah.  Music and bits, though.  What does that mean?  Well, because, you know, it probably had to be edited.  Like we said it would have to be, right?  It's a beginning.  How'd you find out?  Write that down.  We're not sources.  They call Scorch, the kingdom of...  They had no clue at that station what was going on.  Kingdom of Naked News.  Everyone's new.  They're doing a meals broadcast.  Scorch is giving away free meals to the homeless or something. 
[01:18:30]  Hey, look at that.  I'm a good guy.  You mean they had to edit the 45 minutes of best of they were sent?  I don't know.  Let's plan air.  Ouch.  See, the difference is you're not going to explain what you're doing.  I would explain it to people.  Because you're Opie and I'm just a little cast member on the side.  Yeah, sure you are.  I'm more expendable.  You're getting more and more evil by the day.  More and more evil.  True.  So, we did the high profile meeting, phone calls. 
[01:19:00]  It just got nuts.  And then I'm like, wow, I think it's a go.  I think this is happening.  It's looking like it.  And then Fareed wished us a happy holiday and then gave us all a huge box of wine each.  Box of wine!  It was a box with bottles of wine in it.  Lots of bottles.  How many bottles?  Like six to eight?  I put it in the trunk of a cab and it blew out the back tires.  That was the worst Christmas gift I've ever got. 
[01:19:30]  This is the best part.  We haven't talked to Fareed in a while.  You know, we have this love-hate with him like just about anyone else that Anthony and I have ever come across in this radio business.  And it was obvious we're in the conference room having this high profile meeting.  But Christmas is right around the corner.  Yeah.  So he's thinking, I better give these guys something.  And so he just disappears for five minutes and next thing you know, some of his people come by and throw these three boxes of wine on the conference table with little cards. 
[01:20:00]  One says Opie, one says Anthony, one says Jim Norton.  You know he was in the back office quickly going, happy holidays.  I know, happy.  Yeah, I mean, my ink wasn't even dry on my card.  A little smudge.  I didn't get a Jim Norton card.  I had two Fareed cards of mine.  Two cards that's in Fareed, happy holidays.  I guess he scooped them all up at once, yeah.  Oh.  What a lovely gift.  There were like eight bottles, full bottles of wine that he slaps down on the table.  And I'm just looking going, oh my God, I've got to walk to my car now, which is a few blocks away at a parking garage. 
[01:20:30]  Dude, how, was it 25 pounds?  Dude, it had to be 25 pounds.  It was like a 25-pound box.  Yeah, 25 pounds.  And we're carrying it on my shoulder.  Jim's a recovering alcoholic or whatever.  Well, my doorman had been tanked all week.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I can't drink.  It's a fine gift.  I haven't been this happy since someone gave me a baby they cut off a stomach in Kansas City.  Oh.  What is that about?  Huh?  Puppy for sale. 
[01:21:00]  Holy S.  Holy S.  Land shark.  Candy gram.  So, we walked out of there with our really heavy Christmas gift.  Our heavy wine gift.  From Fareed and the fine folks at Citadel Broadcasting.  If we had any balls, we just would have left those three right outside the Citadel door.  Citadel, ugh.  It's all right.  Go ahead.  You wanted to leave them right next to the elevator.  Yeah.  So when he goes home, he has to see his stupid Christmas gifts piled up. 
[01:21:30]  90 pounds of liquor.  Right.  He's sitting there.  Sitting at the side by the elevator.  Yeah, that would have been good.  And we looked all stupid because we're like, we're all carrying it with two hands in front  of us.  We're arching our backs, you know, backward because you need a little more help.  When we're leaving the office, you've got to, like, tuck it under your arm, all awkward  just to shake his hand.  Thank you.  Merry Christmas.  Would a bottle have done the same trick?  One bottle would have been fine.  Yeah.  It was the thought.  So, I guess it's going down and basically, Anthony and I are being heard in Syracuse right 
[01:22:00]  now on 95X.  Hey, how about that?  95X.  We're being heard on commercial radio today.  Yes.  While Howie's on vacation.  Yes.  He's on vacation and they yank him off the air and throw on your pals.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  How about that?  And all hell is breaking loose in Syracuse and this is just the beginning. 
[01:22:30]  This is just the beginning.  One down.  This is just the beginning.  How many other markets is he in?  Hmm.  One down.  I'm going to gleefully state that we are wrecking his vacation.  Yes.  It makes me very happy.  Of course.  Because right about now he's getting phone calls.  He's being woken up with the horrendous news that we're in his hair again.  I am so happy.  Because, well, we're on. 
[01:23:00]  And we're making him miserable.  And this was all like last minute so they don't even have it really figured out yet.  We were supposed to go live live today.  But we're doing a satellite radio show and we're not going to compromise our satellite radio show.  So they're trying to figure out how they can take what we're doing and throw it on a commercial radio station.  That's up to them.  Because we can't really change our show.  We're into doing the satellite radio thing.  So I guess we had to just send a lot of best of material to Syracuse today.  That's what we're doing today.  And then they went through the best of material and went, oh, okay, hey, they're cursing a little bit here. 
[01:23:30]  Whoa, hey, you can't do that on commercial radio anymore.  Whoa, whoa, what's this?  So I guess they're editing the crap out of it and they're playing music and playing what they can right now.  And then hopefully we'll figure out the bug so we can.  We'll figure out a way to transition into live programming.  Yeah, so we could talk to Syracuse live tomorrow because they're all going to hate us, which is great.  Oh, my God.  The people, the fans of this program, hold on to your hats because it's going to be fun.  The hatred that comes through the phone line when we go into a brand-new market is the funniest thing. 
[01:24:00]  And that's something I really did miss about satellite radio.  When we were at NEW, just in New York exclusively, and then we branched out and syndicated first into Philly,  the calls we got, the hatred of our show by these people, you can't imagine.  It is brutal.  How bad was Philly that first day?  Philly hated us.  Philly turned out to be one of our best markets, one of the hugest ratings we've ever had, 
[01:24:30]  one of the highest ratings that Station ever had.  Right, but at first, they wanted us dead.  Get off, you suck.  Shut up.  You're not funny.  You stink.  You're not funny.  Who the hell do you think you are?  This is not what I'm used to.  Right.  And then what do we tell them?  Just give it some time.  Just listen for a week, week and a half, two weeks.  Some people not even.  That's why we call it the ONA virus.  Once you're exposed to it.  We don't know what happens, but all of a sudden it just happens.  You're infected.  And then you want to tell other people. 
[01:25:00]  That beginning part, though, before they get the scratchy throat and sniffles, it's so funny.  They are brutal to this show.  And you will get to listen along with us.  Right, and this is a big deal because everyone in commercial radio, they've been saying since  we got fired that you'll never hear from us again.  Look, we're so into the satellite thing.  We truly believe this is the future of radio.  But it's nice to go back into our roots a little bit and get some of this stuff on regular  radio just to prove to people that, no, we're not blackballed.  We're not done. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  People will hire us again.  They are calling.  They want this show in syndication.  Sure.  Let them just dump out of whatever they can't use.  It's fine.  Just dump out of it.  Who cares?  That's it.  And then the people that have satellite will get the show undumped.  Unedited and in replay.  So I'm wondering if there are...  And then you've got to figure commercials also.  Right.  I'm wondering if there's some XM listeners in Syracuse that could call us right now and  let us know what's going on 95X right now.  Good idea.  95X in Syracuse.  What, Ben?  Yeah, but they're hearing a best-of show. 
[01:26:00]  No, I know, but I want to hear what they're playing.  Yeah.  See, we can talk to someone live now in Syracuse because they have the XM satellite radio.  So they call in and I'm like, dude, could you throw it on the regular radio because I  want to see what they're doing on 95X.  We're very curious.  Right.  That's all.  So it's just going to be a complete nightmare for Howie.  Complete nightmare.  Let's go to Ellis in Philly.  Hey, Ellis, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I had a great time there on Friday.  Oh, you were wondering...  Oh, yeah.  What's up?  I'm wondering, isn't Fareed kind of shooting himself in the foot? 
[01:26:30]  Why?  It's kind of like having a big commercial for XM.  Well, you know, that's the difference, though.  I mean, we're just going to do our show.  I mean, do we mention XM here and there?  Of course.  We don't do big commercials for XM every day on this show.  It's not like Howie talking about Sirius every two seconds.  Because don't forget, once you're on, even though, like, when you're on Infinity, you  can actually be syndicated to Citadel.  Like, you know, I mean, Stern right now, like ONA, where it's Infinity, but then you're  syndicated to Citadel.  It's not like you're doing a commercial for Infinity just by the nature of being on it. 
[01:27:00]  Right.  And I'm not going to, you know, this is an experiment.  You know, we're going to try to figure out and see if this even makes sense.  Citadel's going to try to see if it makes sense.  I mean, they could yank us tomorrow.  They could yank us by the end of the week.  They could yank us, I don't know, in two weeks.  We don't know.  We don't know what this is going to lead to, but we do know this is really, really big  news.  You'll see.  You'll see.  Well, congratulations.  All right.  Thank you, mister.  Thank you.  Let's go to Texas.  Hey, Texas.  What's up?  Hey, y'all.  What's going on?  Well, we're having fun today at Howie's expense. 
[01:27:30]  Hey, listen.  I lived up in Syracuse for 27 years before I come down here.  Yeah.  And Howard is just entrenched up.  And those guys are going to lose their fucking mind.  Oh, we love it.  Bring it.  Love it.  They're going to know what to do with themselves.  Hell, I already made some phone calls.  No, he's, yeah, yeah.  I mean, this will wreck his vacation, and we're all about wrecking Howard's life, because  he's the biggest douchebag behind the scenes that you would ever want to meet.  Yeah, he's definitely.  I got to agree with you.  All right.  Thanks, Texas.  All right.  Thank y'all. 
[01:28:00]  All right.  Bye, fella.  I used to be, you know, I used to be a huge fan years ago, back in the 80s and stuff.  You didn't grow up, especially in New York, without listening to Howard.  That's what you did.  It was funny.  It was entertaining.  Now, though, and especially now, you know, knowing what he's like behind the scenes,  it's just, it's such an act.  You're not, you know, it's not like, oh, I'm delusional and thought that the person on  the air is the exact same person you're going to get, but when he's just screwing you over 
[01:28:30]  personally, it kind of takes away from the humor, you know?  He's such a scumbag, phony.  He didn't, we wouldn't have minded if he, uh, screwed us over royally on his own show  and, and went, you know, quote, toe to toe with us, but, but he turned out to be the  biggest pussy.  He knew he can, like, you know, hang with us.  Oh, when he was, uh, kicking, uh, uh, what's, what are those two guys' names?  Mark and Brian.  Mark and Brian's ass.  Or John DiBella in Philly.  He just, like, destroyed DiBella.  And it was, uh, it was great radio to listen to. 
[01:29:00]  And then you realize, oh, it's just because they were easy targets and easy marks.  Anybody that has any bit of talent, anybody that would have put up any bit of a fight,  he doesn't screw with.  Because he doesn't want to, uh, be put in the position where he might lose.  That's what happened with us.  We started giving him a little crap.  We gave the guy his respect when we came into New York.  You don't come into New York, not being nobodies, and start bashing Howard Stern. 
[01:29:30]  You just don't.  His listeners will rip you to pieces.  Or at least they would have, you know, years ago.  So we came in, did our show, built a listenership, showed people the show we did,  and, uh, and then just started taking little shots at Howard because he was being a hypocrite.  And the people were realizing, wow, yeah, they're right.  I do see this.  And, you know, we were pointing out little things, little hypocrisies that he would do.  How he's an asshole behind the scenes.  And, uh, what did he do?  Did he get on the air and destroy us like Mark and Brian? 
[01:30:00]  Or like DiBella?  No.  He ran to Mel Carmisen and said, Mel, you shut those two guys up.  I don't want to hear them mention my name.  I want their jobs threatened if they mention my name.  That's how he fought.  That's how Howard fought back.  Not on the air.  Not like he did against, uh, uh, anybody else with his big radio battles.  Right.  Screw them.  Well, we could go to Syracuse.  Dan is in Syracuse.  Let's see what's going on.  Uh, Dan, what's going on? 
[01:30:30]  Hey, I just got done driving through, uh, Syracuse and I was playing, uh, High Mom, I'm in Porno.  Oh!  They're playing High Mom, I'm in Porno?  Yeah.  And what else are they doing?  Are they, uh, are they, uh, are they playing some of our sweepers or?  Uh, no, it's just right now we've got the weather going on.  Yeah, they've got to figure it all out, but, uh, we're definitely being hurt in Syracuse.  Maybe they're just playing stuff from our CD or, I don't know.  I have no idea.  I turned it over there when you said it and I was playing that.  All right.  Can you hold on the line and someone pick him up and, uh, as soon as, uh, they have some 
[01:31:00]  O&A material, we're going to go right back to you because I'm curious to see what they're  doing today.  Okay.  Because this is day one.  I mean, this all went down real late Friday and then, and everyone was scrambling all weekend  long to try to figure out how to make this work today.  Well, no time to get a signal up.  It's hard to like, oh, how do you broadcast to commercial from satellite?  That hasn't been figured out yet.  Right.  So, all right.  They're talking to Dan and as soon as like some O&A shit, uh, hits the air, we'll go  back to him.  CJ from Illinois.  What's up?  Hey, what's up all day?  How are you, buddy? 
[01:31:30]  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, CJ.  Thanks for calling the program.  Hey, I just got a little fake.  I was thinking about going down the road here.  Uh, you know how big that is going to be for you guys if you're struggling with syndication?  That the people that don't hear the uncut version are going to want to go to the,  you're the, the uncut version, I mean.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Yeah, it's going to, it's going to be a win for everybody.  I mean, Citadel's going to get huge headlines in the coming days and it's going to help 
[01:32:00]  their company.  It's going to help our exposure across America and, yeah, everyone wins.  And there's not everyone, because not everyone's going to get satellite radio in the end.  So, there's still going to be a piece of the pie for Citadel and these other broadcasters.  They'll always be.  But then there's also going to be people that listen and go, wow, you know, I want to hear  what they're talking about when we have to go to the long commercial breaks on, you  know, regular radio.  They have commercials.  And during that time, we'll still be on the air for the satellite audience.  And they're going to, yeah. 
[01:32:30]  And that's when we go to things like, you know, maybe the wiffle bat comes out or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Who knows?  I think even more than that is that people are going to want to hear, like, usually people  listen for like an hour a day when they're driving or whatever they're doing.  People are going to want to hear the other two and a half or three hours that they miss.  Yeah, then they get the rebroadcast.  Right.  Later on, right.  The rebroadcast factor.  Very sure.  This is just the beginning.  I mean, we're just, you know.  We're working it out.  We're stepping into the unknown, but we'll figure it all out.  But it's just very exciting for the Opie and Anthony show today.  Yep.  Let's go back to Dan in Syracuse. 
[01:33:00]  Dan, what's up?  They're still on commercials.  Still on commercials, huh?  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Okay.  Ben, someone has to just keep him on the line and then, you know, somehow signal to us  that we could go to him when, you know, because that's boring.  Let's go to Frank on Long Island.  What's up, Frank?  Yo, boys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Frank.  Hey, Anthony.  Yes.  Victory!  Of course.  You guys, man.  You know, I've been with you guys since BAB.  Yep.  And this is just the sweetest day for me. 
[01:33:30]  All these bastards sticking on you.  It's the beginning of the payback.  It's the beginning of the payback.  You always win in the end.  I am so psyched for you guys.  You guys fucking rock.  And congratulations, boys.  Merry Christmas.  All right.  You're a good grandson, Frank.  Our enemies had a lot of fun at our expense.  A lot of fun.  They certainly did.  For quite a while.  And payback's going to be a bitch.  It's really going to be hard to swallow.  You should see what we have in store for people.  You should see.  This is just the beginning. 
[01:34:00]  All.  We're working on it, Popeye.  So that's what's going on.  I mean, for a lot of people, you're pretty much like, who cares?  But trust me, for the program, it is huge news that Fareed decided to replace Howard with us.  Do you think the listeners on satellite will get jealous?  Remember the jealousy that happened with our WNEW listeners in New York?  When we branched out and went to Philly and Philly was bashing us, our New York listeners really came to our defense.  And we would put them on the phones together and let our New York listeners just beat the crap out of the Philly listeners. 
[01:34:30]  After a while, and it didn't take that long at all, Philly turned around completely and just really fell in love with the show.  And then New York started getting jealous of Philly and started bashing Philly that, well, we were here from the start.  But we remember, you know, and I'm thinking maybe the XM people that have subscribed to us and been on are going to be a little jealous now that we're inviting in other people. 
[01:35:00]  That was our problem, though.  We, like, kind of played the cities off of each other.  The cities against each other.  We should have just laid back naked and had one big bukkake video made.  Let everyone just have their way with us.  Instead of playing it like, no, Philly, we love you.  No, we love you, New York.  Just be the whore.  Just everyone whip out their hogs and bukkake.  Not even try.  Bukake.  Here's a nice heaping glass of Philly. 
[01:35:30]  That's the most disgusting thing in porn when they drink it out of a glass.  Isn't it really rank?  I don't mind it on the face, but when it comes out of a glass and they can't finish it, and it slowly sloshes back in like warm sherbet.  Viscous sherbet.  Let's go to North Carolina.  Mike, what's going on today, Mike?  Hey, how are you doing today?  Pretty good, Mike.  Yeah, I'm not sure this would be such a good idea, doing this syndication thing.  Why is that, sir? 
[01:36:00]  Well, I mean, it's on the respect.  I think you guys are wrong, but we're going to get like just an hour of hardcore stuff now.  No, no, no, no.  Y'all are popping?  No, no, no.  See, this is a huge experiment.  We don't know where it's going to lead to.  We can't compromise our satellite radio show, that's for sure.  All you need to know today is that we are getting under Howard Stern's skin really, really bad, and that should make you chuckle.  It should just make you chuckle.  I just didn't want it to aim down, you know what I mean?  No, don't worry about that.  The way they work stuff like that is you have somebody on what they call a dump button, and anything that you say that can't be used on terrestrial radio, 
[01:36:30]  a guy hits the button, so you lose that couple of seconds.  So terrestrial will hear like a little thing that went wrong, and they'll know that they missed something.  All right.  Cool.  All right, Mike.  Keep your faith.  All right.  Thank you.  Goodbye, mister.  Let's go back to Dan in Syracuse.  Dan?  Yeah.  So what's the station playing right now?  Some rock song.  Oh, turn it up.  This is what they're playing right now.  It's really bad.  You might hear that. 
[01:37:00]  You get that?  We should give a prize to the first person that knows what song that was, because I have no idea.  I couldn't.  I couldn't.  Was that even music?  Can you understand?  Let me turn it down a little bit.  All right.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  STP.  Wow.  Big Ted wins a prize.  Interstate love song.  Wow.  Maybe we're coming on right after that.  Okay. 
[01:37:30]  I'll stay in touch.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  There you go.  It's going down, though.  We know that much.  It's going down.  Yep.  We're being heard on 95X in Syracuse in place of Howard.  Syracuse.  Yep.  In place of Howard.  With possibly other cities to follow.  Yep.  And wait when Howard gets the bill from Citadel, by the way.  I heard about that.  Yeah. 
[01:38:00]  Maybe we ought to keep that on the QT.  I don't know if they want us blabbering about things that are going on like that.  I'm just wondering if, is he officially being sued?  I don't know.  Or is that just a bill?  Is he being sued or is it a bill?  Kick a lock.  Kick a lock.  Click.  I don't know.  I'm not saying anything.  Let's just say he's not going to be a very happy guy on his vacation.  Yeah, I think his vacation is ruined. 
[01:38:30]  Day one of his vacation is ruined.  If you could think of the last people on the face of the earth he would want replacing him on any of his stations, it is us.  Yes.  He hates us and does not want us piggybacking any of his publicity.  He doesn't like it when we get our own publicity.  Uh, and he would rather have anyone step into any of his stations when he leaves, or before he leaves, uh, than us. 
[01:39:00]  And the fact of the matter is, like we were the first people on satellite radio, hello, first one's replacing your sorry ass.  There you go.  Enjoy your vacation.  I hope your, uh, your girlfriend's rubbing the suntan lotion on your back right now when you get the news.  Oh, God.  Jack off.  Where's my agent?  Yeah, let's play Buttplug or something.  Mel, is there anything you can do?  Gotta play something we haven't played in a while. 
[01:39:30]  How about, uh, uh, have we played, uh, um, Publishers Clearinghouse in a while?  Oh, I haven't heard that one in, uh, many months.  What's that, the Publishing Clearance?  Is that the bit?  Publishing Clearance.  Baby.  Gonna find a listener or we're gonna find a listener?  Frankie Blue, baby, Frankie Blue.  Uh, check this out.  We'll continue.  Hello?  Uh, yes, I, I'm calling, is this...  Yes, it is.  What can we do for you today? 
[01:40:00]  Uh, yes, I just got a call.  Yes.  And he gave me my claim number.  Uh-huh.  Um, because I won a prize.  Yes, you did.  What, what, uh, claim number did you, uh, get?  Uh, 654.  6-5-4.  3-2-1.  3-2-1.  6-J.  6-J?  Yes.  Ooh.  Pretty excited, are ya?  Hey, yeah.  Yeah?  You ever, you ever won anything before?  Never won anything.  Hold on, please.  Oh, okay.  Dude, tell her she won a European vacation. 
[01:40:30]  Hello?  Hello?  That is coming up as a European vacation.  A European vacation?  Yeah.  He had told me something like $10,000.  I wish I were you, as a matter of fact, because it's a European vacation for your family plus $10,000 in spending money.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Uh...  Are you psyched?  Uh, yeah.  I'm like, I'm like shaking.  This is, this is, oh, my God.  Wow. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Hold on.  Uh, we have our supervisor here.  Okay.  He's going to need, uh, I guess some information, maybe.  Hold on.  Hi, ma'am.  Yes?  Hi, this is John Huber, Bill's supervisor.  Can I have that number once again, please?  We've got to verify that you are, in fact, the winner.  Yes, it's, uh, 654-321-6J.  6J?  Yes.  I thought she said A, John.  You thought she...  I thought it was an A.  Oh.  It's 6J?  It's 6J as in, uh, jump. 
[01:41:30]  All right.  We've got some good news and bad news.  You're still the winner.  Okay.  But, uh, your prize is a set of steak knives.  A set of steak knives?  Yes.  The European vacation for you and your family and the $10,000 spending money is for 6A.  Oh.  And you'll have to pay for the shipping on the, uh, steak knives.  Oh, all right.  And that's $19.95.  Okay.  Would you like to, uh...  Uh, no, thank you.  Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.  That's fine.  Okay. 
[01:42:00]  Well, thank you anyway.  Okay.  Oh, that was way too painful, man.  Oh, that poor girl.  Bad smell, bad language, and now bad jokes.  This is the freakiest show I've ever been party to.  We're perverts.  Really?  Stupid.  So you know it's good.  That's why we love doing this radio show.  Right?  Okay.  Terrific.  Time to put your mouth or our balls on.  Buckle up, kids.  It's cool.  Let's just put it this way.  Sexual harassment, mostly.  Just shut up.  I was so offended.  Don't listen, you twat.  Hit her over the head with a shovel.  If you did that, I would make love to you right now. 
[01:42:30]  Come on.  People that get their news from O&A are the same people who watched Sesame Street until  they were 12.  Yes.  Precisely.  Guys talk about nasty stuff like this all the time.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats, because here comes a home run.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ian Anthony.  This is Dominic Kinesi.  You know me.  I play Uncle Junior on The Sopranos, right?  Yeah.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony. 
[01:43:00]  Merry Christmas.  This is what we do to you now.  And a Merry Christmas to you and yours.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America, mostly because of XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:43:30]  And now a little piece of the virus has spread to Syracuse on a little commercial radio station  called 95X.  I don't think that will clear up.  I think that's just going to spread.  Yeah, I do believe that's going to spread.  Take some Tylenol and lay down in bed.  You know what the beauty is?  Today we start our show like just another normal show.  Uh-huh.  All the other high-profile radio DJs in America are pretty much taking these two weeks off.  But we know we can't take time off.  We have to attempt the biggest comeback in radio history. 
[01:44:00]  And we start teasing a little something.  Then we told you what it is that our old pal Farid from Citadel decided to replace Howard  with us in Syracuse.  I don't know how long it's going to be.  Maybe it's just today.  Maybe it's all week.  Maybe it's two weeks.  Maybe it's permanent.  I don't know.  We don't know yet.  We've got to work it out.  But we know this is the start of something absolutely huge.  Yes.  Absolutely huge.  So now we let our listeners know.  And now it's starting to spread, Anthony, isn't it? 
[01:44:30]  The slow spread always starts with us making an announcement.  And then it goes right to the New York Radio Message Board.  And what are they saying on the New York Radio Message Board this morning?  Ever since they started this morning on XM Satellite Radio, Channel 202,  Opie and Anthony have been teasing some sort of return to terrestrial radio.  They've been recapping the Frankie Blue incident of last week and quoted,  until their voices are heard again on that station, N-E-W, 
[01:45:00]  it will never be what it used to be.  More info to follow, no doubt.  And then an answer to that one is they just announced 95X in Syracuse  is running their show in place of Howard's Best Of's.  Hold on.  We've got to go right to Dan.  I don't mean to interrupt you.  Dan is in Syracuse monitoring the radio station.  Dan.  Yeah.  What's going on?  They're playing the worst of stuff.  Some accordion man deal?  Accordion man.  All right, crank it up.  This is what they're playing in Syracuse right now instead of Howard. 
[01:45:30]  I'm sorry.  It's too bad you can't see it.  So you don't think you can come here?  No.  Ever since the accident, I can't really drive.  What, you're getting in action?  Yeah.  Okay.  And the echo, well, it was his own fault.  He was trying to actually play an accordion while he was driving.  That's a silly thing to do.  That old gag.  Wow, I don't think we've ever played that one on satellite radio.  No.  The accordion prank call is being played on 95X in Syracuse instead of Howard Stern. 
[01:46:00]  Are they just playing stuff off at Demented World?  Well, like I said, this went down last minute on Friday that, you know,  they had to figure something out today,  and then it'll get a little better tomorrow, I do believe.  I want to be live.  Yes, Dan.  Live.  Eric.  They're also running our XM imaging for the worst of stuff with the Demented World stuff as well.  Oh, so are they just doing Demented World stuff today, you think?  So far, we only heard two bits.  That's fine, though.  I mean, it's doing its job, trust me.  Oh, yeah.  All we need is our voice being heard in Syracuse instead of Howard Stern's.  That's right. 
[01:46:30]  And we win again.  We win.  All right, so go back to that, Anthony.  They just announced that 95X in Syracuse is running their show in place of Howard's best-ofs.  This is the station that has been blanking out Howard's broadcast every time he mentions Sirius  and cutting his show off at 10 a.m. sharp.  95X is owned by Citadel.  And then that is answered by apparently they've reached an agreement with Fareed at Citadel.  Look for them to replace Howard on the four other Citadel stations he airs on. 
[01:47:00]  Well, we don't know that.  Well, that's what happens on the message boards.  They start speculating, and before you know it, it spreads.  So now it's spread to that, and it'll spread to other websites and newspapers  and possibly a little TV later today.  You watch how this just starts spreading.  Oh, yeah.  Like a wildfire.  Well, they've been looking and speculating on who's going to replace Howard,  so it's kind of a big story.  Yeah, watch and see.  I can't wait to listen to Board Reflections. 
[01:47:30]  Alan Sniffen.  We love the New York radio message board.  Alan Sniffen runs it.  We don't have a problem with him anymore.  No.  We actually like him.  Alan's a good guy.  He was very fair and very nice.  He didn't like us at first, and then he'd just decide to have an open mind about us,  and that's all we ask is you have an open mind, you know?  And be fair with your reporting.  If you hate us, you hate us, you know?  But, you know, if you like us, you can talk about that as well.  And when we were being kicked for the two years that we were out, 
[01:48:00]  he always came to the defense of the show,  saying that, you know, he wasn't a huge fan of the program and the material,  but he respected what we did over there at NEW and how we got good ratings,  and the show was successful, and there was no denying that.  Some people would try to get on the board and actually say that we weren't successful,  which, you know, it's kind of hard to do when the proof is on ratings papers.  But, yeah, Alan is a dentist, by the way.  Runs a radio message board, but he's a dentist. 
[01:48:30]  And he does these board reflections every month or so,  where he does a real audio radio show and talks about the state of New York radio,  and it's hysterical.  He's got, like, music beds and sweepers and stingers.  Alan sniffing, board reflections.  I don't even think that accordion bit is that funny from Dementor World.  No?  I don't know.  There's a lot of really funny tracks off our CD.  Accordion Man was okay.  Believe me, whatever they're playing up there is just getting pounded by people.  I'm sure they're calling them, get this off. 
[01:49:00]  It wouldn't surprise me if they didn't have the right paperwork filled out  and were afraid to play anything off from XM without the right paperwork being filled out  because everybody's just paranoid about getting sued.  You think?  Yeah, because it was Friday afternoon.  Dude, they didn't have this figured out Friday night at, like, 10 at night.  So, I mean, they had to really scramble to try to get anything on the air.  This morning in Syracuse.  And we'll take it to the next level hopefully tomorrow.  Yep.  All right.  Anyway, we have to talk about Frenchie's party, you were saying? 
[01:49:30]  A little bit about Frenchie's party.  Why?  I feel bad.  I feel bad.  What do you feel bad about?  I missed it.  Yeah.  I missed it.  I came home Friday after our big meeting and fell asleep.  I woke up at, like, 8 o'clock at night or whatever it was,  and it threw me off for the entire weekend.  You have a little bit more of an excuse now.  You live out in the burbs now.  I knew you weren't coming.  Great Neck.  It's very hard to drive to this city. 
[01:50:00]  I can't drive there from Great Neck.  Are they really all old in your neighborhood?  I have a bunch.  I live around old Jewish people.  That's hilarious.  Oy vey.  I heard when you get out of the car, some lady started yelling,  Zell!  The white angel!  It is him!  This man needs a doctor!  After he cuts his throat.  Gets him some help.  That is great. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, I live in the neighborhood of old Jewish people.  So you weren't coming back for Frenchie's party.  No, I screwed my sleep schedule up for the weekend.  So by Saturday night, I had no clue what day it was.  And I could not get in my truck and drive back into the city.  Now you guys, you live here.  A bustle and bustle and herky and jerky of Manhattan.  Yeah, I live here.  His party was like a block away from where I live.  Yeah.  And I didn't show up. 
[01:51:00]  And Ovi didn't show up.  How many people were there?  Well, that's what I was going to say.  I went out Friday, hung out a little bit.  And then Ben calls me around, what, 11, 11.30?  Well, no, we were talking throughout the day after I had to give you restaurant advice,  which you didn't even use.  And then you, and then, oh, I'll see you at Frenchie's.  So I'm like, great.  So I had the pleasure of getting Billy Mac to pick me up, which is an adventure in itself,  riding with Billy from downtown Uptown.  With a Budweiser one hand. 
[01:51:30]  Talking about the first time he met Frenchie, which we all forget when he threatened to  drive a truck through Frenchie's old restaurant, which I forgot about.  And now they're pals.  Now they're best friends.  Oh, they're pals now.  Billy Mac.  You'd never know it from listening to the Baltimore talk to each other.  So I had every intention of going to Frenchie's party.  I was pretty much making it an early Friday night, Anthony.  But I figured it was Saturday.  Oh, Saturday.  I'm sorry.  Well, he was, yeah, it was mentioned Friday.  So I was planning on making it an early night, and the party's right there.  It's a couple blocks away. 
[01:52:00]  I'm like, yeah, might as well stop in at the end of the night, say hi to everybody.  And Ben is text messaging me like crazy, when are you going to get here?  And that's the first sign that I knew that he was just in party hell.  Uh-oh.  Because Ben is like, you know, you guys, I mean, Ben is like just a social butterfly, man.  He knows where all the happening parties are every weekend, all the happening night spots.  He goes to the Saturday Night Live after parties.  Right.  He ends up at these, like, parties that end up in page six, and, you know, entertainment magazines. 
[01:52:30]  There's pictures and stuff.  Ben goes to these parties.  Hence, uh...  He knows how to do it.  I don't know how he does it.  Hence all the rumors that he stars.  Right.  Maybe they're not rumors.  It might be like the National Enquirer.  You know, Ben might be onto something with all these exaggerated things he comes in.  We were talking earlier...  Dan Aykroyd is hanging out with...  He was.  College girls.  He was.  That's true.  He's usually right, though.  Earlier about...  And I'll give my review later on Blade Trinity.  But we were talking about that earlier.  And Ben goes, oh, Wesley Snipes. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, I was hanging out at a party with him one time.  I was sitting at the table and talking.  Nice guy.  Like, he just goes to these parties and knows everything, everybody.  Wesley Snipes.  Yeah, Wesley Snipes.  That was years ago at Moomba.  Someth Avenue.  See?  Yeah.  See, he knows.  He knows.  He knows everybody.  Yeah.  So then he's at Frenchie's parties.  I show up to Frenchie's with Billy and we walk in and I walk in and I see Kev sitting  on a chair.  Some French guy who's talking about serious stock.  Oh.  Frenchie and his girlfriend. 
[01:53:30]  I'm like, oh, and the lights are on bright and there's no music on.  And I'm like, oh my God.  It's Saturday night.  Now, all the happening parties, the lights got to be dim, Ben.  Well, you're talking to Ben who throws his own birthday party every year.  Ben knows how to throw a party.  Yeah.  He picks the hottest clubs.  He picks the, he gets a DJ.  What was that party that Ben organized in that place that used to be like a Yankee Cranky  shop?  Happy ending.  Happy ending.  Happy ending.  Oh, yeah.  Ben went there.  What a party that was.  Only Ben could find, yeah, an old massage parlor to throw his birthday party. 
[01:54:00]  Liquid Todd spinning.  Todd spun, yeah.  I mean, it was a piss.  You're sitting in like these, this area that used to be like, I don't know, the steam room.  Yep.  Or the individual Yankee Cranky room.  Yeah.  Andrew W.K. showed up.  Now it's the club.  Did he?  It looks like, it looks like one big, huge, like, tiled bathroom, but now it's a club.  And Ben finds his place for his birthday party.  Yeah, Andrew W.K. was there.  The guy from the spin doctors.  Voss was harassing every woman.  Wasn't Voss a real scumbag that night with somebody?  Yeah.  He was hitting on every woman. 
[01:54:30]  He was like, hey, can you give me a Yankee Cranky?  You know, he was the one that caused all the problems.  Yeah.  It was a great party.  It had a great look.  Yeah.  It was one of those nice, cool Manhattan parties.  Made the newspaper.  Yeah.  Made page six.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's what it's all about.  When Ben throws a party, he just knows.  Knows how it's done.  And everyone wants to go to Ben's party.  Knows how it's done.  Ben's birthday parties, it's like velvet ropes, and there's a doorman, and there's a line.  It's like, but I know Ben.  Yeah, I don't give a fuck.  You're not dressed right. 
[01:55:00]  You're not herky and jerky enough.  It's a B-Y-O-B-D.  It's a bring your own big duties.  Jeez.  So anyway, so I walked in, and I was like, oh, no.  And I'm like, at first time, I was like, oh, there's no music on.  There's like some cheese laid out and stuff.  And Billy's just hammered.  And then this guy starts talking to me about Sirius, and I just, at this point.  Don't relax with Sirius stock.  Everyone owns Sirius stock.  Okay, that's why that thing is never going to go way up like XM did.  Don't make it sound like, you know, I love when people start talking stocks, and they go, well, I picked up Sirius. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, it might as well be a widget stock.  It doesn't matter what the company does, what it sells.  You're just buying it, speculating, hoping it goes up, not based on anything.  What is widget stock?  Is that white stock that acts like Nidget stock?  I see where you were going with that.  You were trying to make a white midget.  Good attempt.  Widget.  Yo, home.  How you doing, B?  Oh, I didn't think of Midget. 
[01:56:00]  I didn't think of Midget.  It's a Wigger Midget.  I did not even think of Midget.  You know, most people buy Sirius because it's down low, and they see XM.  They're like, well, obviously, they're going to go right up to where XM is.  Based on nothing.  No financials.  It trades on emotion.  Yeah.  So, and believe me, everyone's got it.  That's why there's billions and billions of shares out there.  Don't worry about it.  Don't sound like Mr. Wall Street when you come up to us and go, hey, I own Sirius stock. 
[01:56:30]  Ooh, great.  You're going to go to the shareholders meetings there, Skippy?  Ben doesn't miss a beat either.  It's like, are you on Sirius stock?  They suck.  Yeah, they didn't pay me for months.  That's what I told him.  He's like, oh, how could they not pay you?  I go, trust me, I know five other people the same thing happened to.  I've been looking at the financials.  Shut up.  You probably gave the guy 45 minutes of inside dirt.  He was having homosexual encounters in the serious, you know, whatever type of, I won't  even say the position, whatever type of empty studio who might be in there filleting new 
[01:57:00]  talent.  Oh, my God.  Why are you holding a grudge?  I'm not holding a grudge at all.  That's a lousy $50,000.  Dude, I'm not holding a grudge at all.  Hey, thanks for the job.  If you ever want to raise, let me know.  Yeah.  Wow.  Such anger.  Lazy fruit.  Such anger.  Wow.  Why is he a lazy fruit?  Because he didn't put the paperwork in?  Yep.  Yeah.  I mean, we've been hinting about it, but at the old place, Jim lost down on $50,000 because  someone didn't get the paperwork in. 
[01:57:30]  I don't know.  To be honest with you, I don't know if it was 50, what the exact amount would have been.  It was about, it was 50 grand prize winner, baby.  Frankie blew it, baby.  We're going to give you a raise and then we're going to fuck you.  You're going to fuck you, Jim.  Yeah, someone's going to reach their big hands in and just yank that salary right out of your  bank account.  Never went in.  Baby.  Baby.  So, where are we?  So, yeah, Frenchy's party just had, what, a little music playing, bright lights, and a 
[01:58:00]  little cheese platter?  So, I go right over, I go right over, and, you know, Todd, my friend Todd's on K-Rock  on Saturday night, so I start cranking up, you know, his show a little bit.  Whoa, there's a baby that lives downstairs.  Oh, no.  Why do you have a party on Saturday night if the baby's, you know, what?  There's a baby downstairs.  I'm just annoyed at this point.  No music.  No, no, no.  I'm sitting there.  So, Ben is texting me.  I erased all your messages because I, no, the only reason was he used up all my memory.  He literally gave me 20 messages, Anthony. 
[01:58:30]  Well, you said you were coming.  And what were they?  Where are you, you dick?  Stuff like that.  When you're coming.  That pretty much tells you right there.  Oh, that's what I'm getting at.  Somebody save us.  I'm a little tired, right?  But I'm like, it's right there.  I should stop by.  Maybe, you know, honestly, I was thinking maybe you're going to be there.  Oh, yeah.  Some people from the show.  Maybe some people I haven't seen in a while.  Sure, it'll be fun, you know?  A little tired, but I'll make an appearance.  So, he's text messaging me like crazy, and then he finally gets me on the phone.  He goes, where are you, dick?  And I'm like, Ben.  I swear, that's exactly what I said, because I hear no music, no talking. 
[01:59:00]  I go, Ben, it sounds like there's about 10 people there.  He goes, that's about right.  I'm like, and that's when I said, I'll be right over.  You told him you'd be right over?  Jokingly.  Like, yeah, I'll be, I'm putting my shoes on right now.  Yeah, sure.  And then all night long, the text messages coming in.  It was just, because then you're trying to find it out.  So, I'm sitting there with Kev.  Well, is it true that Earl, who's the most boring person alive, stayed for 10 minutes?  Earl, no.  And he's all, what?  It was like six minutes. 
[01:59:30]  It was enough time to stuff down a piece of cake.  He didn't even take off his coat.  And Earl is always looking for something to do, because he's very lonely, has no friends.  He's always looking for someone to eat with, or hang out with.  Some ear to babble into.  So, if he stayed for five or six minutes, you know it had to be just a complete drag.  Where are you going, Tuma?  Earl walked in, and then he yanked the honeybees over it, and everybody got stung.  So, how'd you get out of it?  I'm a hurt you, Ray.  I don't remember how I started to work out of it, but I said I had to go do something else. 
[02:00:00]  And I used Earl.  I don't even remember.  You stayed.  What the hell did you do after I left?  I stayed for a little while.  Did anyone else show up?  Because Frenchy's like, oh, more people are coming, more people are coming.  And Ben takes his weekends very seriously.  Of course.  And then he gets a hold of me yesterday, and he goes, it ruined my whole weekend.  Oh, Ben.  It ruined my whole Saturday night.  Oh.  It was just, you know.  It wasn't going to make page six, huh?  No, well, you know.  Really back to sleep with his face in the cheese.  Page six, it wasn't going to make page 128. 
[02:00:30]  You know those stupid little stories they put on, like, page 128?  Why would you go to that on a Saturday?  It's funny, like, last week they were like, you want a Frenchy's party?  I almost didn't allow the statement to register for an answer.  You won't allow it.  What?  No.  My health won't allow it.  Well, we went, what was it, last year?  I didn't go.  I was out of town, I think, last year.  But it was in a bar.  Yeah.  It was in a bar.  Down in the village last year.  Yeah, there was music playing.  There were more people there.  Frenchy's brother was, like, opening big bottles of champagne with swords. 
[02:01:00]  He was taking a sword and hitting the top of the champagne bottle.  And the little glass thing, and the cork go flying, and, you know, it was kind of showy.  Yeah, Frenchy's brother.  And this year it's in his apartment.  It's in his new apartment, too.  This is a new place, you know.  Shh, there's a baby.  There's a baby.  Oh, that's hilarious.  And, wait a second, I forgot, too.  So I brought a gift.  I'd never met his new girlfriend, so I figured, oh, this would be funny.  Remember how I was talking about the porn that the cleaning lady found the other day?  Oh, yeah.  Well, I put that in a nice bag and brought it in, and she was just, like, the worst. 
[02:01:30]  Just, like, you know, these black chicks on the front, big black sea, you know, stuff like that.  But he's like, oh, you're so nice, a gift.  He's opened up.  A thoughtful gift.  By the way, if you're ever at a party and you're afraid you're going to wake the baby,  you know how you solve that?  Just watch the last five minutes of Caligula.  That's how you take care of that little pesky brat.  Jesus.  Oh.  Grab it by the feet.  Oh.  It's the same guy that tells me, you know, off air, I really would like a girlfriend.  Yeah, exactly.  She gets pregnant.  We all know what's going to happen.  Trips a daisy down the steps. 
[02:02:00]  Trips a daisy.  Oh, right on my stomach.  Because that's the beauty of looking like me.  Oh, wow.  I forgot I even did that bit.  Yeah.  I know more of his bits than he does.  Yes.  Well, for me, it's just so organic, man.  Well, see, most guys, they get really paranoid when they get a chick pregnant because they think,  you know, the girl's going to have the kid or at least hold it against you.  And Norton's like, but the beauty of looking like me is that they'll, what, throw themselves  down the stairs?  I don't know, but I can sense this bit's going to bomb, so I'm not actually going to help 
[02:02:30]  my own joke bomb.  I think I got there, though.  You were close.  I got there.  Dave in Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Dave.  Good morning, Fluffer Matters.  Hi, Angel Face.  I'm just picturing Howie sitting there right now with the 8mm playing, just saying, turn  it off like his daughter.  Oh, wait, wait.  Yeah, yeah, no.  He's in the Caribbean right now, sipping a sea breeze.  Turn it off.  And boy, Gary's on the phone telling him the bad news, and this is Howie.  Turn it off. 
[02:03:00]  They're on.  They're on.  They're on your station, boss.  Get.  No, it's Opie and Anthony replaced you in Syracuse.  What?  Turn it off.  You nipple?  Punch it out.  You guys rock.  Bye.  Yeah, we just ruined someone's vacation today on the first day, too.  Nice.  If we were nice guys, we would have waited until the third day.  Let them get a little sun and sand first. 
[02:03:30]  All tree gonfanas.  Dan.  Dan in Syracuse.  What's up, Dan?  Ah, they keep playing music.  I think it's going to be a lot of music and a lot of short bits today, because, like I  said, this went down so late Friday, I don't think they were able to get it together in  time.  Uh-oh.  That's okay, though.  You guys rock.  Do you want to stay on hold, or do you have things to do?  I've got to go deliver this load.  All right.  You've got to deliver a load to who?  All right.  We'll let you go.  If there's anyone else listening to XM Satellite Radio in the Syracuse area that can help 
[02:04:00]  us out.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Oh.  Dan?  Yeah.  I think I heard...  The airplane's open, Anthony, right now.  Hang on.  Oh.  Sammy, the poisonous bobs made you ass.  There's William.  Young William.  Oh, dear.  Wow.  Dr. Smith on Demental World. 
[02:04:30]  All right.  That's some pretty recent stuff.  Dr. Smith on Demental World?  Yeah, Dan.  That's some pretty recent stuff.  All right, Dan.  We get it, you ass.  It's the start, though.  All right.  Thanks, Dan.  I guess what they're doing is they're playing a lot of music on 95X in Syracuse instead  of Howard Stern, and they're running our liners that we cut yesterday.  What's next, an 18-bit?  I know.  And then they're playing a lot of tracks from our Demental World CD.  But why not the stuff that you sent over the weekend? 
[02:05:00]  So they couldn't get it together in time?  I guess they couldn't, yeah.  I'm telling you, this all went down top secret last minute on Friday night.  It's happening.  We'll work it out.  The key is it's happening.  That's the best part about it.  Don't worry about day one.  All right, Anthony.  Sexual harassment audio.  Oh, I love this.  Yeah.  And then when we get back from break, what we're going to do is, it's kind of a new feature  on the show.  It's a very interactive radio show, and every day our listeners are sending in stuff for  us to play, hoping it's going to be the next big hit, hoping it's the next get your 
[02:05:30]  cock out, the next big thing that they can then talk about on the message boards.  Hey, did you hear my song?  And they'll be the star.  But a lot of rejects happen during this segment.  A lot of people leave with broken hearts, Opie.  Doesn't quite work out.  What's wrong with Steve?  All right.  You just want to tell me those racist songs that were sent in on the 45.  We've got them.  Oh, okay.  On the 45.  All right, we'll talk to, I don't know, we'll talk to Steve about that next as well.  But we have three things for the listeners to play today.  An old trick of fudders. 
[02:06:00]  An old one?  Should I even name the stuff?  The one will give away the bit.  No, don't even name them.  Just play the one showing one.  That's really creepy.  All right, well, there's one really creepy one.  Yeah, there's three things that we'll review next live on the show.  But first, it's the, where is that thing?  Can I say something?  Some of our listeners are creeps.  Really frightening.  Just awful people.  That's great.  They get inspired in the worst ways.  We're looking at a sign that says Lil Conner, Opie and Anthony XM. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, thank you, whoever sent those signs in.  I guess they're for the assault on the media.  That's great.  What do you want to do?  Somebody can hold that sign up behind a reporter during one of their live shots  and maybe go down by the Today Show when they pan the crowd  and hold up the Lil Conner, Opie and Anthony XM.  Yeah, just disrupt a live broadcast.  What do you have against him?  Nothing at all, actually.  He didn't cost you $50,000.  I don't know if it was $50,000.  I don't want to lie and say $50,000.  Kane from South Carolina. 
[02:07:00]  Hey, Dr. Phil says you should take something and replace it with something.  Yes.  You should take Howard Stern and replace it with Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, Jim, did your mom call?  Did your mom broker this deal for us?  That made sense.  I'm punching out, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, we got audio.  I mean, a lot of Christmas parties this time of year.  Most Christmas parties are over now, I guess, but I still have my thing.  I'm just trying to set up the bit.  Caroline's is too nice.  Oh, Caroline's?  Yeah, that's right.  I wanted to go to that, but it's so late. 
[02:07:30]  It's usually the best one for all the comedy clubs.  I know.  Caroline's is the one.  Caroline's is like the top notch of comedy clubs.  They really take care of us.  It's great.  And there may be comedians.  Well, whatever.  Tell me the later.  Oh, poor Jimmy.  What's the matter?  You have a gripe?  No, not at all.  Oh, I thought you had a gripe.  No, no, the comedians do with most of the clubs.  Oh, yeah.  So, um.  Comics are a bunch of pansies.  No, no, for money.  They're looking at, like, possibly striking.  Yeah, it's going to be a mess.  A comic strike?  I don't know if that's going to happen.  Oh, I can just see the wacky signs now. 
[02:08:00]  Hell no.  We won't joke.  No, the comics are pissed off in New York, man.  And then scabs.  You think scabs will hit the.  Scab comics?  Is that hacks?  It depends on if they do.  A lot of the clubs have been kind of.  How are they going to?  They want to strike?  I don't know.  That's very preemptive.  I know they're going to strike.  But a lot of the comedians, and they're really organized this time, are fucking angry at the  way the money situation is in New York.  But you guys do get robbed.  Raped.  And some of the clubs have been very cool about coming to the table and talking. 
[02:08:30]  And the comics are not asking for that much.  But some of them won't even call the comedians back.  And you guys that are not calling the comedians back, you are really going to be surprised  when fucking good comics don't work your clubs.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I mean, you're really going to be in for a rude shock.  It's pretty much free entertainment.  And the only reason people are coming down are for the comics.  And they pay them like crap, treat them like garbage, and then just shuffle them through.  I guess most people don't understand when comics like Norton and everyone else you know  and love aren't traveling to your city to do their big showcase for the weekend. 
[02:09:00]  They're working on their acts in their hometown, whether it's New York or L.A. or what have you.  Philly.  Philly.  Sure, why not?  And so what they do, they spend Friday, Saturday nights just going from comedy club to comedy  club to comedy club, doing 15, 20 minutes of material to practice it and things like that.  And the owners of these clubs, they don't give them much money to do that.  No.  I'll tell you what we make.  For many years, it was 50 a set on the weekends, which is, you can't actually pay your rent if 
[02:09:30]  you do enough shows in New York.  Going out to L.A., it's 15 a set on a weekend.  $15 a set.  Disgusting.  Like, let's say Norton goes to L.A. and does, I'm just going to say comedy store.  Store, Laugh Factory, whatever.  Yeah, he'll do his 15, 20 minutes.  It's a packed club, and he walks off stage, and they're giving him $15 in cash.  Like, that was a good job.  What did he do with 15?  So then he has to, then someone like him, if it's L.A. especially, then you have to run  around all night, try to do ten or, you know.  You can't pay your rent in L.A.  We're doing comedy in clubs.  In New York, now it's 60 a spot in most.  Like, Comedy Cellar, 75. 
[02:10:00]  I think Gotham, 75.  Yeah, I mean, they went up, and Comedy Cellar uses, like, six comedians.  So, I mean, they have a decent payout.  They're by far the best, as far as that's concerned.  So you can pay your rent.  But the comedians, I think, just want a raise, because there's, like, the cost of living goes  up, and everything goes up, and you're not paying us any more.  And not asking for road money, just a little bit more here.  And most of the clubs, again, you know, Seller, I think Gotham, you know, probably Carolines,  are all willing to talk about it.  But a couple of these other clubs are going to be in for a rude fucking shock.  And you guys aren't really asking for a huge raise.  Just a little bump. 
[02:10:30]  A little bump would make a lot of people happy, right?  Absolutely.  No one's looking to rape the clubs.  We want the clubs to exist.  People want the clubs to be there.  Nobody wants to run clubs into this.  Our pay is nothing to laugh at.  I'm sure it'll say that.  Some dope.  It'll be on the news.  Some dope with his dopey comedian sign.  Turn our frowns upside down.  But half you guys would turn into scabs, because all you guys just think about yourselves.  You are very selfish.  I mean, when you strike, you have to look at your fellow employee and go, are you in this? 
[02:11:00]  We're in this together, right?  But I know comics.  It's all about them.  This is what we thought, because I'm not giving up stage time for anything.  They'll strike for like two days and go, you know what?  What?  No, fuck you.  I could get in there now.  I could get a better time slot.  See you later, guys.  But if one club at a time is targeted, all the comedians can still work.  But hey, just don't work this one.  That could be a problem for the club.  If one club at a time is targeted, it could be a major.  I don't want to go on a strike.  I don't know if it's going to happen.  United is a prison yard.  See, I don't know.  I wonder if it ain't I got to stay out of this one. 
[02:11:30]  We love both sides of that, man.  What do we do?  We love the club owners.  We love the comedians.  You love the club owners you deal with.  What club owners have you dealt with?  Caroline's, who's fantastic.  Caroline's, I can't imagine that they would be bad.  They're not scum.  Caroline's is great, man.  They want to, Caroline's always is the right thing.  Love the gang at the cellar.  They're not even, we don't even talk about the cellar.  Oh, okay.  All right, good.  No, of course not.  You think I would ever fuck the comedy cellar?  Never.  All right.  So back to the sexual harassment audio.  I heard this on the replay over the weekend.  Holy crap.  When the one guy talks about his fat, blah, blah, blah, the other guy. 
[02:12:00]  I was spitting up coffee.  Very funny.  We don't have to, we could just let this roll, right?  Yeah.  Because it's self-explanatory.  But basically it's audio from a sexual harassment video, Anthony.  I think most of it's real, right?  I can't even tell what's real or what's not anymore.  That's the funny part about it, because we've sat through those stupid sexual harassment  videos, and you're right.  I don't know which is fake and which is real.  I know.  It sounds like it.  A lot of the scenarios that we saw in past tapes were so ridiculous, right?  Yeah.  And can I say the clip of me that they use in there was taken out of context. 
[02:12:30]  The gentleman and I were just talking, and it was recorded and twisted.  And it shouldn't have been even brought up in a sexual harassment tape.  Absolutely not.  And we still have lots of show to do.  We have to talk about Michael Jackson, the Star Jones thing.  How about the retard dolls?  I'd love to get to that.  The retard dolls.  Okay, sure.  So, first, though, here's the sexual harassment video, or the audio from the video.  You hear about sexual harassment on TV, and it makes the headlines in newspapers. 
[02:13:00]  As an employee, what do you need to know about it?  First, sexual harassment is against the law, and it's against your company's policy.  So, what is sexual harassment?  Linda, you are doing a fine job here.  Oh, well, thank you, Steve.  But, you know, you might try dressing a little sexier at work.  I'm sorry?  I mean, we're talking about your job here. 
[02:13:30]  There may be physical harassment.  Wow.  You're really tense today, Nancy.  Ow!  Bill!  Sorry.  You looked really tense.  You know, I really don't like it when you do that.  Can you please stop?  I'll never stop, Nancy.  Never.  In some instances, the harassment may be verbal.  Word around the office is you've got a fat cock.  Yes, I do. 
[02:14:00]  I've got a fat cock, too.  Maybe we should rub our fat cocks together sometime.  Maybe a little oil.  Two fat cocks together.  Oil.  It might be visual harassment, such as derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings.  Sexual harassment is not always about sex.  It may be the result of a power struggle between a manager and a subordinate.  Man, I could go for a power fuck right now. 
[02:14:30]  Change is slow, and what was acceptable in common behavior years ago can now be sexual harassment.  Smells like vagina in here.  Excuse me?  Smells like fresh vagina in here.  Are you talking about my vagina?  Maybe.  Everyone wants to be treated fairly and with respect. 
[02:15:00]  Treat your coworkers with the courtesy and respect that you want for yourself.  It's your company's policy, and it's the law.  Hey, man, did you hear that?  Hey, everybody, Santa's here.  Aw, there ain't no Santa Claus. 
[02:15:30]  Yes, there is.  There is, too, man.  Here!  Here!  Here!  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Merry Christmas, boys.  Oh, shit.  Rent, Peter.  Come on, you swinging hamsters.  Get over here.  We're going to sing us a happy Christmas song.  Oh, no.  Not another corny, stupid song.  Yeah, no way.  Dad, you tell him, Robert.  Yeah, no way.  Get over here and sing or I'll ring your little neck.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  So wrap your nuts, hamsters, gather round with me. 
[02:16:00]  Forget about all that teasing.  We're breaking out the holly and aluminum tree, cause it's that jolly season.  Oh, boy.  I know you've been naughty, but have you been nice?  That's only Santa's business.  That's right, Brett.  He's making his list and he's checking it twice.  Oops.  Holy shit, it's Christmas.  Santa comes just once a year.  Show him lips.  Just like you, Brett.  That's what we do.  Hey, wait a minute.  He's got a soft spot for reindeer.  Oh, looks nice. 
[02:16:30]  Especially Rudolph Barrier.  Hey, knock it off, fellas, it's a holiday.  Go on and give Santa a big kiss.  No way.  You can play hide the hamster on a one-horse sleigh.  Hey, wait a minute.  Holy shit, it's Christmas.  Hey, what happened to my lyric sheet?  Anyone seen my lyrics?  Heck, we don't need no lyric sheet, Fred. 
[02:17:00]  We know our parts by heart.  Right, fellas?  Yeah, sure.  I know my parts by heart.  Yeah, me too.  Well, that's great, guys.  I love Christmas songs.  There's a tribe reaching up the neighbor's blouse.  After drinking all the eggs off.  Is that necessary?  Haps out in the bathroom for an hour or two.  Squashing off a yule.  God, please.  We wander in his undies all over the house.  But we grinded our own business.  Well, we got something after the bucket wrap, too. 
[02:17:30]  Holy shit, it's Christmas.  Santa comes just once a year.  Up the chimney, he'll disappear.  Keep on the lookout for Mr. Gear.  Hats and a little ring in the rear.  Roast nuts chest and on an open fire.  Santa's tongue stuck to the doorknob.  What?  His balls got funneled by a caroing choir.  While the parson gave him a hand.  What? 
[02:18:00]  The sleigh came down and took him away.  The whole damn crowd was dismissed.  Cause it's time to be golly and it's time to begin.  Holy shit, it's Christmas.  Holy shit.  Holy shit, it's Christmas.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  It's Christmas.  Well, you know, I've heard a lot of radio over the years.  This is probably the worst.  Back, way back in the middle 60s, there was a small station outside of Moline, Illinois. 
[02:18:30]  I believe it was WRCW.  Not sure of the call letters.  1590 day timer.  Signed off at sunrise.  Sunset, rather.  They were pretty bad.  They were pretty, pretty darn bad.  But this is probably worse.  Oh!  Agapame to Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony show.  XM 202.  Happy holidays, everyone. 
[02:19:00]  Happy holidays.  See you at yours.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[02:19:30]  Not in the Christmas spirit.  Slowly but surely.  Not this year.  Not this year.  No.  I just want this year to end.  Yeah.  How are you, Anthony?  We'll be in Vegas.  Right after the new year.  Well, if the bus gets here.  Yeah.  The bus over the icy roads.  Maybe they could pull you on a sled with XM written on the back.  Oh!  We could broadcast.  I was all... 
[02:20:00]  I was kind of pushing for the tour bus idea to Vegas.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Yeah.  I was listening to the replay.  I'm like, wow, Opie's really into this.  I thought it would be kind of fun, and I think we'd get some good radio out of us being miserable  on the road for three or four days.  And so I was definitely a pro.  Pro tour bus to Vegas.  Yeah.  Until I heard about the 80 car pile up on Route 80 over the weekend.  That's what happened.  And then I was reminded that, yes, Anthony, you're right.  You mentioned this on the air.  It is indeed winter. 
[02:20:30]  Winter is here.  Winter is not a good time to take road trips.  No.  Not at all.  So now I am completely against the tour bus to Vegas idea.  Over and over again.  Oh, yeah.  Over and over again.  How big was the pile?  80 cars.  Are you exaggerating?  80 cars.  The highway...  The highway was closed for eight hours.  How many people killed?  None, right? 
[02:21:00]  Miraculously.  Just a bunch of little...  Yeah, they just kept slamming into each other.  Slamming into the back of the pile.  Well, just like we joke about here on the program.  When people are bombing.  Oh, and there it is.  On the news.  Look at that.  Right on the TV.  Yeah.  Wow.  Was it actually like a bad accident?  Or did it all start when this guy Pat was in the shoulder just telling jokes?  Well, I finally got that one out after three minutes of stabbering, talentless idiot.  Tell us that again, Tuma. 
[02:21:30]  Why don't you just drop a jar of honey on my foot?  Hey, sports fans.  Oh, I should be shot down while trying to take a bum plane away from the city.  You're going to cry?  You're going to cry?  Basketball off the head.  Come on, squirt.  Squirt.  Squirt.  That is one of the greatest scenes in movie history.  That's fantastic.  Great centenium.  Ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  What a prick.  Bull Neacham.  I love him.  Put the head in the toilet.  This is interesting.  CJ from Harrisburg, PA, Anthony. 
[02:22:00]  Yes.  Just want to let you guys know that the Citadel station here in Harrisburg, PA, that usually  runs Howard in the morning, is just playing music today.  Hopefully the virus is spreading here as well.  Oh.  Well, you never know.  You never know, CJ.  You never know.  You never know.  Fire.  We are being heard in Syracuse today, though, on 95X, in place of Howard.  Huge news in the radio community.  All right.  So, uh...  We're not doing the bus.  No, we're not doing the bus to Vegas.  Apparently not playing either, because I haven't gotten any tickets. 
[02:22:30]  I haven't either.  I heard that we were supposed to have been gotten in touch with by somebody who was...  Oh, no, no, no.  The fight should be all done by today.  Oh, really?  All set.  Yeah, you went first class.  You're pain in the ass, Jim.  I didn't ask for first class.  Yes, you did.  I demanded it.  First class, please.  I'd like an aisle seat, too.  Who am I going to talk to about that?  You didn't get Kenny's 12 emails over the weekend about this?  You don't like window seats, Jim?  You know what it is?  If I'm with a friend, yes.  Yeah.  But if I'm not with a friend, no, because I pee so much. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, you're the pain in the ass get up guy.  Oh, dude, I am awful.  I thought I peed a lot until I started hanging out with him.  You know how awful I was?  Me and Patrice O'Neill were flying back from L.A. years ago.  Patrice is diabetic.  And I'm in a window seat next to him on a TWA flight, which is very comfortable to be cross-country  next to Patrice O'Neill in a window seat.  He probably has to be in the aisle just to even out the weight of the plane on either side.  You don't want him sitting too close to the edge.  And he's like, man, you should be checked for diabetes. 
[02:23:30]  I'm like, why?  He's like, because you peed more than most people.  And it really freaked me out.  I didn't say the story had a fascinating ending.  I'm just...  Did you at least get checked?  I wasn't...  Yeah, you're right.  That story stunk on every level.  Diagnosis at 30,000 feet.  I'm curious as you got checked.  Starring Jim Norton.  Patrice O'Neill.  Oh, wow.  A Quinn Martin production.  Dial D for diabetes.  And then dial B for boring story, stupid. 
[02:24:00]  Why would I tell that?  Piss in the Sky.  Starring Jim Norton.  Did you get checked, though?  Oh, yeah.  I've been told no, but you never know.  You never know.  Thanks.  See, that's my medical words of wisdom.  You never know.  You never know.  You know what I am?  I'm a fat-titted dullard.  God almighty, do I stop this radio show?  You never know.  Well, you never know.  Sure.  You never know.  All right.  So, you want to play the things that came in over the weekend from the fine listeners  that we have? 
[02:24:30]  Certainly.  Some of these become hits, but most get thrown in the garbage, right?  But they're trying.  It's a very interactive show.  They're trying.  Well, anything we talk about seems to fire up the people's creativity.  Yeah.  And they send in songs based on what we babble about here on the show.  Some of them good, very entertaining.  Some of them bad.  Some of them bad and very entertaining for some reason.  And some of them just plain creepy.  Yeah.  We got a creepy one in today.  Ugh.  But first, Adrian from Indiana. 
[02:25:00]  Go ahead, Adrian.  Real fast.  Hey, I'm just curious if Jimmy ever got his paycheck and ever got his bag robe or wizard  robe.  Jimmy?  Well, it looks like they did call, Kevin Australia called or emailed said they were going  to send it out overnight because they owed me for two months.  But again, I don't trash that because I actually, my contract took a little longer for other  reasons.  So, I think I did call Bob Eatman will hopefully let me know.  Super Agent Bob Eatman. 
[02:25:30]  Yes.  You are now using our Super Agent?  Yes.  Very interesting.  Thanks to you guys.  Uber Agent Bob Eatman.  And you, Ant?  Well, the EverQuest 2 servers seem to have crashed over the weekend, causing an uproar  in the geek community, Opie, like I had never seen before.  The message boards were just rocking with angry geeks that were angry at Sony who puts the  game out.  You couldn't log on to the game.  And then came real horrific news that there was going to be a rollback. 
[02:26:00]  What they do is they roll you back to a previous date.  So, any experience you had made, say over the weekend, before the server crashed, will  be wiped out and you will go back to wherever you were.  You'll lose materials that you have harvested, money you had made, levels you had gained.  Oh, wow.  And be wiped out.  I hadn't played, so I was lucky.  And as a consolation, they took some of your experience debt away, which you gained for  getting killed in the game.  I got on, got a good group.  A big fan from the show came up to me, a young sorcerer, who was a level 16, I believe, came 
[02:26:30]  up and saluted me.  Wow, really?  And said, big fan of the show.  How do they salute you?  A cyber salute, was it?  No, it's all animated, so you have these emotes, they call them, that you can do.  All emotions.  Yes, exactly, that you can do in the game.  So, somebody, you can walk up.  Emotes.  And you see their characters salute or bow or laugh.  Look at my emote. 
[02:27:00]  That's ick.  I think your emote is ick.  I know what the salute is.  It sounds like this.  That is an emote labeled blow, yes.  Wait, I think I got an emote.  Do you have an emote?  Well, continue, Anthony.  It's an emote.  They're expressions that you can put on your character's face, or things that they do with  their body, like wave.  If you're leaving a group, you wave goodbye, and your character waves at everybody.  And they all wave back?  Yeah.  Or if you want to point at something, you use an emote to point. 
[02:27:30]  Here's my emote.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Only the best for our listeners.  That's audio from Friday's show, everybody.  That's a great emote.  Thank you.  That was Pat, spelled P-H-A-T.  Yes, he was.  So what happened?  Well, I finally did get online and hooked up with a very good group of these little rat 
[02:28:00]  people.  And they got me through a part of the quest.  I am now halfway through the fifth part of my quest, and then there's a sixth part afterwards,  Opie.  So within the next, I guess, week, I will have my wizard robe.  Yes.  So I don't have it yet.  All right.  I'm very excited.  We've got to go to Maggie in Syracuse.  Jack's J-H-A-X.  I'm on the Luckin Delirer site server.  Thank you.  Whatever.  Maggie. 
[02:28:30]  You don't like my name?  What's your name on it?  J-H-A-X.  J-H?  Yeah.  J-H-A-X.  It's just one of those random names that were kind of awful.  Was C-H-O-C-K-S-H-U-C-K-E-R taken?  Shox shucker.  Shox.  Maggie, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[02:29:00]  Hey.  I just wanted to let you know that on 95 in Syracuse, they're just played from the demented  world when you called the tobacco company.  Wow.  Another bit.  They're playing all the tracks we don't play.  We don't play.  Okay.  Yeah.  No kidding.  There's a reason we don't play those tracks.  All right.  Thanks for the update.  We got our spies in Syracuse.  We're being heard on 95X.  Yes.  Our material is, anyway, today.  Yeah.  We'll work it out.  And that's in place of Howard, which has just got to drive him absolutely batty today. 
[02:29:30]  Piss him off.  All right.  So that was it for your update, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm updated now.  Okay.  So now we got the three things that came in.  Oh, what is that?  What do you got?  Splooed on the board?  Give me a freaking...  What is that?  I don't know if it's spit.  Oh.  It's not.  Oh, God damn it.  Is that a piece of what Pat...  I don't know what the hell it is.  All right.  Projectile Pat.  So we got three things that came in over the weekend for the radio show from our fine listeners. 
[02:30:00]  Is that the same bowl of cereal?  No, it was a new one.  I went to the granola.  You have two different types of cereals here?  Yeah.  I got to eat all morning.  You're a grazer.  I'm a grazer, yes.  All right.  So the first song is by DJ New Style, Anthony.  It's a...  DJ New Style.  Unfortunately for me, but it's great for you guys.  It's another little Connor Peterson song.  Oh. 
[02:30:30]  And it's full of sunshine and butterflies.  You guys admitted before the show that this one is a bit creepy.  I think...  Oh, no.  This is a...  It's like a tribute, right?  Yeah.  It's a bit creepy, though.  This is really creepy.  This guy's awful.  His voice is creepy.  Yeah.  The song is creepy and devoid of any humor.  You can tell as he's playing it, he's probably staring straight ahead, strumming a guitar with  a powerful erection.  Oh.  So here it is from DJ New Style.  It's called O'Connor.  O'Connor. 
[02:31:00]  O'Connor.  O'Connor.  O'Connor.  I don't know.  Leonard Cohen listened to the show.  O'Connor.  I had a roadboat and a wife I've grown to hate.  And then she got pregnant.  What a terrible fate.  I don't want my son.  So I dumped him and his mom in the sea.  Fishing on Christmas Eve. 
[02:31:30]  Thirty-two weeks old.  He's going on thirty-three.  I'd say he had lacy's eyes if we knew where they might be.  Oh, they found my son.  Little puddle of shattered hopes.  Broken dreams.  Fed every fish in the sea.  O'Connor.  O'Connor.  O'Connor. 
[02:32:00]  O'Connor.  What is your problem, you insensitive asshole?  Wow.  The creepiest part of that song, besides his voice and thousand-yard marine stare, is the  fact that he says 32 weeks.  That just makes it so much of a baby's age.  Yeah.  Thirty-two weeks.  I love it.  You like it?  Love it.  O'Connor.  Oh, it's a little creepy. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, Sandra Day.  Oh.  It was very creepy.  Very creepy.  So we got that in over the weekend.  And this next piece of music.  I don't think you'll be hearing that one anymore.  No?  No.  That was pretty bad.  Won't hear that one anymore.  Yeah.  So that didn't make the cut, right?  I don't want to hear it from him no more.  I like that one.  I got to disagree.  Respectfully.  We'll see what the listeners say, too.  They got a piece of this.  Can we at least keep the chorus where he's just going,  Frankie Blue, baby.  This is O'Connor. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  This is by Author Unknown, Anthony.  Doesn't want to take credit for his work.  Let's take a listen to this.  Came in over the weekend.  She said she loved me  And that she let me in her pants

[02:35:30]  Growing on me  I was an idiot  Oh, oh, oh  I should have just punched my appendage  Way down deep into her hemorrhage  That night  She had a period  P-E-R-I-O-D  How could this happen to me?  Both of us were screaming  Down my face  Her blood was streaming  And it glistened in the dashboard light  She had a period 
[02:36:00]  I was an idiot  Oh, oh, oh  I should have just punched my appendage  Way down deep into her hemorrhage  That night  She had a period  She had a period  I was an idiot  Damn thing grew on me

Hey, the jerk off  Whoever sent that in  Yeah  Did not write that  That's off of an album  Called Pig Vomit  And there's so much better songs  Than that crappy ass one  On that album  Was that a pig vomit song?  Well, maybe he didn't send it in  As himself  He sent it in as author unknown  Yeah, maybe he just found it  And then thought it was funny  And decided to send it to us  Well, I want to hear

[03:02:00]  Like I'm his pal  He ain't calling in  Chuck Heston calling in too  Chuck Heston  Bobby De Niro  Jimmy  We'll add him to the list of people that  Didn't call in  Didn't call in  Yeah  Bob De Niro  Did SNL this week  Yeah  My friend got a picture with him  Oh  Dean  Here he goes  Tambourine Man  Tambourine Man  Listen listen  Hey Mr. Tambourine Man  Hey Mr. Tambourine Man  Hey Mr. Tambourine Man 
[03:02:30]  Let us go  I just want to smoke hot  When you hear this  Take LSD  I'm not sleepy  And there is no place  I'm going to  What is that?  Hello  Don't go  In the jingle 
[03:03:00]  Jangle morning  I'll come following you  Take me on a trip  On your magic  Swirling ship  Oh  The horrible  My senses  Have been stripped  My hands 
[03:03:30]  Can't feel  To grip  My toes  Too numb  To step  Wait only  For my boot heels  To be wandering  Wondering  Wondering  Wondering  Wondering  Wondering  Wondering  Wondering  Wondering  Wondering  Wondering  Wondering  I guess you get the idea right  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  That could be the worst thing I've ever heard  Yeah and he did it not as a goof  It's not even fun  It's not even interesting if it's done to be ironic  Even then it's not interesting  He did that as a dramatic reading of these popular songs of the day and thought it was going to take off I guess 
[03:04:00]  Someone approaches him going Bill we love your acting style why don't you do a spoken word to these songs and he did it you know he has that delivery that's very slow and stick out  Christopher Walken would be interesting to hear or Nicholson seriously reading a song  You think?  I would like to hear that Walken especially  Nah it would be pretty much just like what we just heard I think 
[03:04:30]  My tambourine man fire phasers  My tambourine man photon torpedoes  I got in some feedback Anthony from Pat the winner of the eggnog drinking contest from Friday  He won the My5 the portable XM satellite radio  Yeah  And he writes because we were wondering what happened to him after Friday's show  If he wants to call in we'd love to talk to him  Yeah  Don't we have his number still?  Maybe Ben could produce the show today  Where's Ben? Is he answering emails? 
[03:05:00]  Yeah probably  There he is  Yeah  That stupid hat you can see sticking up in the office  Yeah he's  Yeah  He looks like Papa Smurf with that hat on  Papa Smurf is trying to get the latest gossip off the computer  Perky Smurf? Is that his name?  Guys this just came in  Yeah  Nick Carter wasn't really fired  He just  Nick Carter's on fire is he?  Yeah  He could let our buddy go  When?  In the boot from BCN?  Yeah a week or two ago  Oh man I like Nick 
[03:05:30]  Instant feedback from Pat  The winner of the eggnog drinking contest  It says  The next day I felt like someone hit me in the ribs with a bat  I barely got home before I shit an eggnog smoothie out my ass  And then he writes I actually lost three pounds from the contest  I'd like to hear that take a nice dump like that  By the way someone is saying that Walken does have a spoken word thing out  We'll have to find that  I'd love to hear Walken do it  All right yeah and this was Pat after he won the contest  After 70 double shots of eggnog  This is what we've been playing all morning 
[03:06:00]  That was just insane  Was that the most insane puking you've ever seen Anthony?  That was  I've never seen somebody vomit like that in my life  All right  Picture yourself in a pool at the bottom  Yeah he'll call 
[03:06:30]  Ben Folds actually produced the album  Oh yeah?  So that's what's kind of  It's getting  I think you said it  It's getting a lot of play on regular radio  Getting the hip factor  Ethel's playing it on XM  What time is Bill Shatner calling in?  9.15, 9.30  Between 9.15 and 9.30  So we're less than 10 minutes away  Before we file this with the Tom Cruise interview  Maybe they're going to call in together  And do like a tag team  Oh that'd be interesting  Lieutenant Sean and Captain Kirk battling it out 
[03:07:00]  Let's be honest with each other  William Shatner is not calling our show today  You don't think so  No  Why not?  I can't dial the phone  All right  Well we can play his latest song though  It is a really cool sounding song  There's a man on the wing  It's not like the stuff we just played  It's off his album Has Been  A song called Common People  And regular radio is playing this thing right?  I heard it on Ethel on XM  So it's cool sounding  It sounds kind of like cake  What was on there?  Oh Pat  All right  God we got to keep going backwards  We're trying to go forward with this show today 
[03:07:30]  Pat what's up buddy?  Hey what's up?  Here he is  The winner of the eggnog drinking contest  Pat?  Pat?  Yeah  You're as exciting on the phone as you were in studio I see  I was waiting here  I felt like I was in a car crash  And I was  27 of them  How'd you feel after the contest?  Uh well  On the way to the parking lot was like one big fart  Really?  And uh  Yeah and then I felt impending doom 
[03:08:00]  I didn't even do any of the paperwork for the mic bike  Why?  Because I felt impending doom  When everybody was taking the pictures with you guys  I just had to get out of there  And then you got home and uh  Exploded  Wow  Where's home for you Pat?  Uh Munaki  Right by Giant Stadium  Can you not live in that town?  That name is horrendous  Of course he lives in Munaki  It's like a cancerous tumor they pull out of your rectum  Munaki  We found two Munakis on your bowel  I love Munaki 
[03:08:30]  You want Ben?  Munaki's great  Why do you like Munaki?  Is it an Indian word meaning bulge that's upsetting to look at?  We did our first big event ever was in Munaki  That's right  I liked Mr. Munaki  Who was the teacher in Karate Kid  You might remember  I like Munaki  It's when Japanese guys jack off onto your face  In cups  Make him drink it  Uh  So  So Pat you lost three pounds because of the contest?  Yeah  So what are you down to?  384? 
[03:09:00]  347  347  Maybe you just took your shoes off when you got home  Yes  Alright well  This is an exciting post interview  Laugh riot  I wasn't even trying to be funny  Alright so you just shit and puked all weekend long?  Yeah for the most of the fun  I had to go back to work  So I went to my next delivery and had to shit there  Alright  Alright Pat  Well congratulations  You won the MyFive  You gotta fill out that paperwork Pat 
[03:09:30]  Alrighty  Thank you  Bye sweetie  There he goes  Pat the winner of the eggnog drinking contest Anthony  Yes  Anyone else notice that Big Kev is running around panicking and sweating?  Big Kev set up the William Shatner interview  Oh he's not like he's on the phone?  He's on the phone  Yeah look guys  They're talking about it on the radio  Is Mr. Shatner awake yet?  Right  I need Mr. Shatner on the phone now  Tell him it's someone who looks like Bert Lahr  No I'll accept they sound alike at this point  Just get me someone that sounds like Bobby Shatner 
[03:10:00]  I need Shatner on the phone  Warp drive  Come on  We're not stupid  Can he beam him into the studio?  He's in a panic  He's trying to talk in a calm voice  It's hello  I had an interview with William Shatner  Yes  Yeah you and the rest of the world  Get in line  His non-working nose is just flailing  Mr. Shatner was scheduled to do an interview with Opie and Anthony  Let's see what he says  I'm wondering if  Yeah what is he saying?  With his tussleable hair  What is he saying Big Kev?  Is he out of the galaxy?  Why don't you admit that  Uh oh  What does that mean you're working on? 
[03:10:30]  Who did you just call?  I'm working on it  Who did you call?  I'm working on it  He called Lieutenant Uhura  Who is trying to locate Captain Kirk in his quarters  Big Kev what seems to be the problem?  You know he's going to call him  I hope to God you have a nice bib for all the crow that's going to spill out of your mouth when he calls in  I'll get him  I'll get him  Hold on  Anthony to Captain Kirk  Anthony to Captain Kirk  Please come to the studio  No that didn't get him? 
[03:11:00]  Maybe he's on the planet  Hold on  Energize  Is he beaming in?  No  Damn I'm trying everything I know to get him  Open a hailing frequency  Hey Kev you look a little uncomfortable and nervous  Is it going to happen or what?  I'm afraid I'm going to be fired  Fired from working for free  I understand the joke  But is he calling or not?  No  Is it 9.30 yet?  It's 9.25 and a half 
[03:11:30]  9.31 and then start breaking my balls  Alright  Alright well William Shatner off his has-been CD  This is actually a good sounding song that  Quote regular rock radio is playing  I'm not sleepy and there's a station I ain't going to  Called XM  Let's take a listen to this okay?  Alright  Brand new William Shatner on the Opie and Anthony program  She came from Greece  She had a thirst for knowledge  She studied sculpture at St. Martin's College 
[03:12:00]  That's where I  Caught her eye  She told me that her dad was loaded  I said in that case I'll have a rum and Coca-Cola  She said fine  And in 30 seconds time she said  I want to live like common people  I want to do whatever common people do  I want to sleep with common people  I want to sleep with common people like you  Well what else could I do? 
[03:12:30]  I said I'll see what I can do  I took her to a supermarket  I don't know why but I had to start it somewhere  So it started there  I said pretend you've got no money  She just laughed  She said oh you're so funny  I said yeah  Well I can't see anyone else smiling in the air 
[03:13:00]  Are you sure?  You want to live like common people?  You want to see whatever common people see?  Do we have to break into the song Anthony?  We do  Is this really William Shatner?  Hello?  Bill?  Hold on  Is this really William Shatner?  Don't break into the song  We'll just play it again  No we'll just play it again  I'll play it again after we speak to him  That's crazy 
[03:13:30]  You've got to play that whole thing  People have to know how good that record is  We love it  Mr. Shatner I was telling everyone how great that song was  We really were  You know the Mr. Tambourine and the Lucy in the Sky  Not really sure what to think of that  I know you recorded it a long time ago  But this common people thing is a really  It's a cool song  Well that's good  The Tambourine Man stuff was part of another record called Transform Man  Yes  Which they're re-releasing  But it was all part of the Transform Man 
[03:14:00]  Was something that had to be listened to in its entirety  If you lift a song like Tambourine Man out of it  People have got to wonder what in heaven's name is he doing  And I think for the time it came out  Didn't it take a little maybe  You know a little pot or something  To really get the full gist of it  Well that or a single malt  But yes and no  I have mixed feelings about the Transform Man 
[03:14:30]  I haven't heard it in some time  So I don't know how good or bad it is  But  It's pretty bad Bill  It's pretty bad  Yeah  I think it's just become quite humorous  Like people play it  And they're not like really trying to get into it  I think it's really kind of a laugh  I disagree  Wait a minute  Let me argue that point  Sure  Let me argue that point  No problem  Have you heard the whole record?  No I never heard the whole record 
[03:15:00]  See that's what I mean  You're speaking from ignorance  Yep  I usually do  Yeah and it's a strident voice  Having no knowledge  You know what this is  It's like I am a race that is so below you  That I am like a mere bug in intelligence  And maybe in years and years to come  I will be intelligent enough to be able to communicate with you  Not if you don't do your research  When you have all these millions of people that are listening to you  And hanging on your every word 
[03:15:30]  I understand Bill  I gotta tell you it's one of my favorite CDs  I play it a lot  Anthony just doesn't get it  Mr. Shatner this is Jim Norton  And I'm a big fan  And I happen to enjoy it too  And Anthony just refuses to listen to the whole thing  And I'm like dude you're not going to get it  Tell me just between us  Yeah  What's the matter with Anthony  I don't know  I just I found it funny  But I guess I gotta listen to the whole thing  I told you that  Yeah we were trying to tell him for like 20 minutes  Mr. Shatner  Better than that  Bill if I will  Listen to one cut  But one whole cut 
[03:16:00]  Because it's a six minute cut  Rather than a three minute cut  Really?  Yeah  It's a six minute?  Well it starts with literature  And music underneath the literature  And segues into a song  My whole idea was trying to relate  The literature of the past  With the literature of the present  And using music as a bridge  Now whether that works or not  Is something else  But not to play the whole thing  Is to do me a disservice  And it's ignorant of him  To like judge it only on that  I'm sorry Bill 
[03:16:30]  Judge it by having some knowledge  I understand now completely  Told you  And I will listen to the entire cut  And as we move forward  William  Bill if I will  Moving forward  Alright let's move forward  What's the whole Has Been album about?  I've only heard common people so far  The Has Been album  First of all  It would be a great gift  In this late Christmas rush  To somebody who  Wanted to  Hear music about love 
[03:17:00]  And laughter  And life  And a piece of  My heart  Yes  And there is a musical genius  Called Ben Folds  Who does some  Extraordinary work there  And  The notices on the album  Of  Has Been  Have been  Unlike anything I've ever been  Associated with  Did Ben Sparks do?  Ben Folds  I'm sorry  Ben Folds  Why the name Has Been?  Why is that title?  Well  I wrote the song 
[03:17:30]  Has Been  Because I saw it attached  I saw the words attached to my name  On my way to Nashville  To record the album  How is that attached to your name?  They called me Has Been  Now who would do that?  You're still a pretty popular guy  Still  No no  Take the word pretty out  I'm no longer pretty  You're a popular guy  You're Americana  You're a very popular guy  Well  Maybe  You don't think you're still attractive 
[03:18:00]  To the females out there  I'm sure you've got girls  All over you  All the time  Yes  But they're over 65  And I don't think that counts  Remember that poster of you  When you were covered in tribbles?  Chicks still  Like cream over that one  I know  But  But we're talking about  The past  Yeah I know  The future  You know it happened  Doesn't time just suck?  Yes Bill?  You've got to understand  You're going to get old too  No I believe me  I know  No we're not making fun of that 
[03:18:30]  I understand  We think time is a major drag  I just think that you're downplaying yourself  Because I'm sure a lot of girls  Are still very interested in Bill Shannon  Maybe  But if that's the judge of popularity  I suppose it is  The point being  I wrote a song  Called Has Been  And I thought it would be  Interesting  Maybe amusing  To name the album that  I think it works  Yeah I mean  You have to ask me  Why Has Been  And that's 
[03:19:00]  Good marketing  Well I had to ask  Because I didn't like the idea  Of you painting yourself  In that light  Because you're not a has been  Well if I weren't  Then I'm not  Right  And if I am  Then you wouldn't ask  Now how about your return  To television Bill  On Sunday nights  At Boston Legal  On ABC at 7  At 10 o'clock  I see a Shatner resurgence  Maybe  Maybe 
[03:19:30]  Now this is your first  Like full time TV gig  Since when  What was the last one you did  Probably Rescue 911  Oh we like the Rescue 911  And TJ Hooker  And TJ Hooker  Yeah I love that one too  Did you watch  Did you watch the show last night  I don't think so  No we have to go to bed real early  I know  We do stupid morning radio  So it's a pain in the ass  To watch stuff  I gotta TiVo it though  But I  Did you  No I did not watch  Last night's show  So  Bill 
[03:20:00]  He doesn't  He doesn't watch  Boston Legal  In actual fact  You guys have never seen  Boston Legal  Yeah  Yeah it's just faking it  For the interview  He's never seen  Boston Legal in his life  And I don't really appreciate him  Trying to kiss your ass  But I make him believe  That he listens to Boston  Boston Legal  I gotta say something here  I don't want to get off  On the wrong foot  I think I'm getting off  On the wrong foot  With Bill Shatner here  Because he's one of my  Like  I love this guy  And now these people  Are painting me  As if I'm not  Quite the  Bill Shatner fan  As though you're  An ignoramus  Yeah  You don't like his music 
[03:20:30]  You don't watch him on TV  I watch him all the time  And I  And say I'm pretty  I watch  Yeah you were the one  Who said he's pretty popular  Not popular  But the girls love him  You know what I'm saying  You did throw in  That he was fairly  And slightly popular  No I say he's huge  And I  And I'm having a resurgence  From where  Yeah  Well  He never went away  Where did he say he went  I meant on television  I'm beginning to wonder  Whether this whole thing  Really isn't an insult  No  Yeah  Anthony 
[03:21:00]  No Bill  I'm a huge fan  This is how you treat  Your heroes  I bought  I bought every single  Star Trek on DVD  When it was put out  In that god damn set  That you had to buy  Like two episodes  Per disc  Really  It was a pain in the ass  But I bought every one  Because I'm a huge  Bill Shatner fan  I bought all the movies  You've been very disrespected  Why don't you just tell him  You loved him when he hosted  In search of  You've been extremely rude  Since he called in  No  That was Leonard Nimoy  I know  That's what I'm saying  That's the way you're treating him  You see Leonard around a lot  He's a good friend of mine  Yeah  He's a great guy too 
[03:21:30]  I see you in those  Priceline commercials  It's hysterical  How do you know  How do you know  He's a great guy  Yeah exactly  You know why  Because it looks like  You two really have  A good relationship  On those Priceline commercials  And I'm just taking  What I see from that  Have you guys  Got a good relationship  Or are you somewhat antagonistic  We have a good relationship  Do you see each other outside  No  Now we used to  But you know how it is  I mean  Do you really show up  At his house now 
[03:22:00]  Nowadays  Who me  Yeah  Do you go to Leonard's house  Do you go to Leonard's house  For cocktails  Or a birthday party  You don't  Right  Cocktails  Actually we do  He does  Yeah  I'm hopeful  He's coming to my house  For Monday Night Football  And you talk about  How bad the episode  Of Spock's Brain  Was  No  We only tell each other  How good we are  Because that episode  Wasn't too good  Spock's Brain  Yeah Spock's Brain  Whenever that one comes on  I'm like  Oh that's Spock's Brain 
[03:22:30]  You see it's that kind of detail  I don't have  In my fingertips  Therefore I don't talk about it  You know what I mean Anthony  I hear you Bill  I know  You've moved on  I know  But you've got to admit  A lot of people  Are still very into Star Trek  I guess they are  And I think it's something  You should be very proud of  Well I am  I'm not  I'm not  I am proud of it  What's the opposite of proud?  Ashamed  I'm not ashamed  Yeah  For a moment there  My brain didn't work  Any truths to the rumors 
[03:23:00]  A return to Star Trek?  Yes  There's a great deal of truth  Really?  Exactly which rumor are you?  A return to Star Trek  And who told you this rumor?  It's something I read on the internet  Yes  Well  Are you a Star Trek geek?  I believe everything you read on the internet  No?  He's a Star Trek geek William  Are you going to maybe be on an episode of Enterprise?  Not this year  But maybe they'll ask me next year  They had asked me to be on  And I had suggested a price for my fee 
[03:23:30]  And they suggested maybe I shouldn't be on  Wow  Bill Shatner demanding the big bucks  As well as he should  Of course he should  Because he's a legend  You know what I saw the other day?  I saw that Twilight Zone episode  The one where  Not the one everyone thinks  With the man on the wing  But the one where you're in that little diner  And you're pulling out the little answer cards  From the devil machine  And you were  Can you tell me why  Yes  They keep playing that  Can you tell me why they do that?  Because 
[03:24:00]  I don't understand it  Because it's  That stuff holds up  Those old Star Trek episodes  Why?  Because you're fantastic in it  No, no  There's got to be some  There's got to be something that appeals to people  Some fear  Or some ability or something  That appeals to people  Yeah  I think those are just great stories  All those old Twilight Zones  And your hair looks fantastic in it  Say that again?  Who is that?  Sulu?  Who's that?  No, the guy  I'm going to do a satellite radio network 
[03:24:30]  Right now  And I called you guys first  To say thank you for playing the has-been  And supporting the record  Are you trying to say you have to leave?  What town are you in?  No, no, no  I don't  But someone just came up to me  I'm going to give you a little insight  As to where I am  I'm outside a parking structure  In a car  On a cell phone  Oh  And somebody came up to me 
[03:25:00]  And I thought  Oh, Lord  He's going to ask me to move  And I'm talking to you  And I'm on the air  Whereas he turned out to be the guy  Connected with  The radio satellite tour  That I'm going to do  You're not doing them all  From inside the car, are you?  I'm what?  You're not doing all of the interviews  From inside your car, are you?  No  Of course not  Only the better ones  Now that was an insult  No, not really  I cannot convey to you  What a big fan I am  Have you played  Have you played any other songs 
[03:25:30]  From Has-Been  On the air?  Well, I think we should start with  Playing Common People  The hit  All right  Common People has done a lot  There's some good love songs there  Yeah  There's a terrific  Brad Paisley  Sings a wonderful western country song  Okay  Why don't you try that one?  What song is it?  It's called Real  Real  I think it's the last song  Oh yeah, okay 
[03:26:00]  Real  It's the last song on the album  Bill, I saw you on the Comedy Central special  How'd that go?  You were singing and dancing at the beginning  And it was fantastic  With seven, count them, seven  Seven girls  And you totally held your own  Are you patronizing him now?  I am not  I thought he did a fantastic job  I am probably the biggest Bill Shatner fan ever  And I'm honored to be on the phone with you  Singing and dancing with pretty girls  Swirling around is where the whole show biz thing is at 
[03:26:30]  You understand that  I totally understand  Everybody aspires to dancing on the stage with seven beautiful girls  Yes  I think that's the ultimate end of all show business  I think you're right, Bill  Singing and dancing with these long-legged beautiful girls  All tap dancing and kicking their heels  Is really where it's at  You are absolutely right  I'm a huge fan  I didn't want to get off on the wrong foot by Bill thinking  You know, I wasn't 
[03:27:00]  Well, I told you  It's not that you're off on the wrong foot  It's just that you're limping a little  You're limping a little  Do you like that he calls you Bill?  I just  It's okay  I'll answer to that  Well, you know, Mr. Shatner  I had told him many times that he had to listen to  Bill was okay  All right, Bill  Bill was okay  He had to listen to the whole album  And he just kind of refused  And he judged it very quickly  And that just kind of bothered me  That he wasn't given the original  The respect that he should have  I mean, he really should  And the Transform Man is the parent of a has-been 
[03:27:30]  Yes  If I hadn't made Transform Man  I wouldn't have made a has-been  And no insult at all, Bill  But you do understand that people have looked at Transform Man  And over time it has now become something that's more humorous  No  They've looked at that one or two songs  Right  And mocked that  But they haven't mocked the album  The album is used in schools to teach  People have played the whole album  Ben Folds, who we all agree is a musical genius 
[03:28:00]  Would not have made a has-been  If it wasn't for the Transform Man  Which he had heard years ago  Joe Jackson, who sings Common People with me  Heard the Transform Man years ago  Wanted to be on this record  Henry Rollins, same way  Matt Chamberlain, who plays drums  Genius percussionist, same thing  So you're not taking that 
[03:28:30]  That Transform Man is a bit of a humorous thing  No  I didn't mean it to be humorous  I meant it  Well, humorous, yes  Fun  Entertaining  But I didn't mean it to be  For Anthony to poke fun at it  Yeah, because it is about literature  And how it was  And how it is in modern day times  Yeah  I'm not poking fun  I'm just saying that that's kind of how  It's looked at  I guess when it's taken out of context  Anthony, we get it  You don't like the album  Yeah, so I told you  You have to listen to the whole thing  And you're like 
[03:29:00]  No, I just want to listen  You can't just judge it by like a little piece of the song  Right  How about his live performance of Rocketman?  Was it Mike Douglas or Murph?  Oh, jeez  That goes on  I mean, jeez  Yeah  That goes on  That goes back so many years  Why don't we talk about what he's doing today?  I am, but I'm just bringing it up  That that was kind of taken out of context  Because it was one song  And that's what people saw  Exactly  They asked me to sing a song  So for a gag  I sang a song  Like I thought Frank Sauter would sing  With the cigarette and everything? 
[03:29:30]  I'm a rocket man  Yeah  I loved that  It was supposed to be amusing at the time  Not 30 years later for people to  You've got to give it credit  It's still amusing 30 years later  As long as I can bring a small, sad smile to your face  A small, little, sweet smile  And a thought  What in heaven's name is he doing?  Thank you, Bill 
[03:30:00]  And actually, I ask the same question myself  About twice a day  What in heaven's name am I doing?

[03:31:30]  She had a thirst for knowledge  She studied sculpture  At St. Martin's College  That's where I  Caught her eye  She told me that her dad was loaded  I said, in that case  I'll have a rum and Coca-Cola  She said, fine  And in 30 seconds time  She said  I want to live  Like common people  I want to do  Whatever common people do  I want to sleep 
[03:32:00]  With common people  I want to sleep  With common people  Like you  Well, what else could I do?  I said  I'll see what I can do  I took her to a supermarket  I don't know why  But I had to start it somewhere  So it started there  I said, pretend you've got no money  She just laughed 
[03:32:30]  She just laughed and said  Oh, you're so funny  I said, yeah  Well, I can't see anyone else  Smiling at it  Are you sure?  You want to live  Like common people?  You want to see  Whatever common people see?  You want to sleep  With common people?  You want to sleep  With common people?  Like me?  But she didn't understand  She just smiled and held my hand  Rent some flags above a shop  Cut your hair and get a job 
[03:33:00]  Smug some flags and play some fool  Pretend you never went to school  But still you'll never get it right  When you're lying in bed at night  Watching roaches climb the wall  If you called your dad  He could stop a hard head  You'll never live  Like common people  You'll never do  Whatever common people do  You'll never fail  Like common people  You'll never watch your life  Slide out of you 
[03:33:30]  And dance and drink and screw  Because there's nothing else to do  Sing along with the common people 
[03:34:00]  Sing along and it might just get you  Move  Where are the common people?  Like common people  Even though they're laughing at you  And the stupid things that you do  Because you think that poor is cool  Like a dog lying in a corner  They'll bite you and never warn you  Look out  They'll tear your insides out  Because everybody hates a tourist 
[03:34:30]  Because everybody hates a tourist  Especially one who thinks  Ain't so such a lot  Yeah  And the chip-stained spreece  Will come out my back  You will never understand  You will never understand  How it feels to live your life  Without meaning or control  And there's nowhere left to go  You're amazed that they exist  And they burn so bright  But you can only wonder why  When you're in a flash 
[03:35:00]  You're in a flash  For the shop  Cut your hand  And get a job  Smoke some fag  And break the pool  Pretend you never watch the school  But still you'll never get it right  Because when you've laid in bed at night  Watching roaches climb the wall  If you called your dad  He could stop it all  Yeah  You'll never live like common people  You'll never do  You'll never do  What common people do  You'll never fail 
[03:35:30]  Like common people  You'll never watch your life  Slide out of view  And dance  And drink  And screw  Because there's nothing else to do  Wow  I really like that song a lot

[03:37:30]  I have saved the world in the movies  So naturally  There's folks who think I must know what to do  But just because you've seen me on your TV  Doesn't mean I'm any more enlightened than you  And while there's a part of me 
[03:38:00]  And that guy you've seen  Up there on that screen  A lot of truckers  Banking it up right now  So much more  And I wish I knew  The things you think I do  I would change this world  For sure  But I even sleep and breathe and bleed and feel  Sorry to disappoint you  But I knew 
[03:38:30]  Got this log  Stardate 2165.6  I'd love to help the world  With all its problems  But I'm an entertainer  And that's all  So the next time  There's an asteroid  Or a natural disaster  I'm flattered that you thought of me  But I'm not the one to call  And while there's a part of me  Is anyone calling Bill Shatner
