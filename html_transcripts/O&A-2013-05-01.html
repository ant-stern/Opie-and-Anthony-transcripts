<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton discussing a 747 cargo plane crash in Afghanistan, blaming improperly secured cargo.  The conversation quickly shifted to Amanda Knox, with commentary on her appearance and speculation about her guilt or innocence.  Norton then launched into a lengthy, explicit recounting of his adolescence, detailing his father's reactions to his perceived homosexuality, his awkwardness with girls, his obsessive relationships, and the death of a friend, Richard, from AIDS.  This segment included graphic descriptions of sexual encounters and relationships. The hosts then discussed George W. Bush's "Mission Accomplished" speech, criticizing its inappropriateness.  Comedian Joe DeRosa appeared for a bit, followed by the recurring segment, "Should I Suck a Dick or Not?".  The entire first segment was rife with vulgar language and covered death, murder, sex, and homosexuality.

The next segment began with a strongly worded critique of US foreign policy in the Middle East, particularly in Syria,  questioning the motivations behind interventions and advocating for non-interference. This was followed by a discussion of the George Zimmerman trial, clarifying the media's misrepresentation of his legal strategy.  A significant portion focused on a CBS Houston blogger fired for criticizing an Oklahoma City Thunder cheerleader's weight, with the hosts engaging in crude and explicit commentary about the cheerleader, the blogger, and the public reaction.  They sarcastically mocked the "white knights" defending the cheerleader online, with one host announcing his intention to send a supportive tweet. The segment also included a brief discussion of outdated school AV equipment and a humorous, dark anecdote about a sausage race injury.  The final portion returned to commentary on the public's perceived oversensitivity and lack of honesty.  This segment also featured highly offensive language.


The third segment was a nostalgic reminiscence about childhood television from the 1960s-80s,  jumping between memories of historical events like the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the fall of the Berlin Wall, and personal anecdotes about their childhoods and families (using highly offensive language to describe their parents' arguments).  The hosts extensively discussed various television shows,  playing theme song clips and making offensive jokes.  Significant attention was paid to a *Mad Magazine* record album,  specifically the song "Make It Out," which was played in its entirety, accompanied by more vulgar commentary.  Other media, such as *Street Sharks*, *Dr. Demento*, and the song "They're Coming to Take Me Away," were also discussed.  The hosts mentioned that Vinny Guadagnino, Uncle Nino, and Nino's mother were expected as guests later in the show. The segment also contained offensive language and jokes about Gwyneth Paltrow and Chelsea Handler.

A segment on marital advice began with a discussion about using oral sex to resolve arguments, followed by speculation about the sex lives of Gwyneth Paltrow and Jay-Z, and the hosts' experiences with apologizing to end fights. Vinny Guadagnino, his mother, and Uncle Nino from *The Show with Vinny* then joined the show.  Discussion included Nino's stroke, his vegan lifestyle, filming the reality show in their home,  interactions with celebrity guests (Lil Wayne, Kesha, and Mark Wahlberg), a negative review of the show, family dynamics, Nino's childhood, and Vinny's travel anxieties.  The segment ended with plugs for various events and shows, including a commercial for Steven Singer's gold-dipped roses. The segment used frequent profanity and sexually explicit language.

The final segment consisted of listener calls. Manuel sought advice on telling his overweight wife about her musty smell and vaginal odor; Ben discussed headaches while masturbating after his wife's death; Reed talked about his sponsor's relapse; Ben described his difficult divorce from a pill-addicted ex-wife; Ron was concerned about penis shrinkage; Randy discussed his affair due to lack of attraction; and Glenn challenged the hosts' views on coddling women. The hosts provided advice and engaged in discussion on these issues.  The segment ended with a sexually suggestive Mother's Day advertisement for Steven Singer Jewelers,  mentioning that Vinny, Uncle Nino, and Nino's mother had been in studio earlier. The segment included further discussions on the complexities of divorce and relationships with children.

[00:06:00]  good now though like like they really gussied her up a bit yeah did she need a boyfriend um  hey man what's up i uh i'm a real piece of shit because i don't care i went to break right there  because i really don't give a shit what any of these chicks do i'm just looking like you know  like uh fucking casey anthony you know yeah i'm kind of like i don't even care if she killed her 
[00:06:30]  kid i'd fuck her i'd juggle them big titties you know but this one might kill you ah you gotta keep  your eye open one eye open when you sleep is that the trick yeah also uh a lot of people feel that way  look at all these serial killers that get married in jail richard ramirez and all these chicks go to  see them so people have an attraction to people who've committed crimes yeah but you know what  it is it's different with the uh girl going after the guy in prison because that's a that's a weird 
[00:07:00]  emotional like fucking connection that they get and and mine would be you know it's purely physical  you don't want to save these girls you don't think that you can turn their troubled ways around  hell no i just want a great story of how i had sex with a murderer right you're not a piece of shit  that's the difference you just want to fuck a pretty girl if you got emotionally attracted to  someone who bashed in a head with a lamp then you're a psychopath that's crazy now you're just a 
[00:07:30]  guy yeah okay good thank you yes i feel better about myself people that go to fucking marry serial  killers let's hear her talk i want to hear what she sounds like me crank that up she uh who is she  with diane sawyer diane sawyer vaseline lens man do they really fucking fuzz up that lens with her  felt as if i were being sealed into a tomb yeah and the tomb was my life it wasn't the prison  it was my life did you think you don't like it no she just got uglier no yeah and the interesting 
[00:08:00]  thing is as restricting as prison is i mean you can't have your own nail polish in the room for  oh damn there are plenty of ways that you could kill yourself and people did oh and i imagined doing  them all whoa she seems a little cunty she seems a little cunty yeah a little bit you know what just  based on the two or three sentences we heard her speak i would absolutely say she murdered you think 
[00:08:30]  so yes she sounds like a murderer is she certainly does to me too yes what did she say uh which is  what was the first thing she said before the nail polish can you play that again uh that's uh the  prison was in herself oh yeah oh god her life was how many times she said that cheesy line to people  at parties yeah that'll be in the movie too yeah and the tomb was my life it wasn't the prison  it was my life uh see the way she said it twice did you think about suicide i did yeah and the 
[00:09:00]  interesting thing is as restricting as your nail polish we got it we heard yeah exactly polish a clip  with my face oh that it's a surprise that this woman who may have killed somebody might be a little  cunty or mentally unstable that you guys are like oh no she she seems like she's got an attitude  or if she is innocent and she spent that much time in a fucking italian prison right yeah she may 
[00:09:30]  have a complex she might be a little off i want to write her a love letter yeah you're still into her  hey amanda we should do that what would you write it's like like how do you break the ice with these  girls how do they pick letters out there and be like oh this is a special one i know what we say  yeah hi amanda you probably don't know me and then in parentheses unless you have a television  that's good though get yourself built up uh from the other layman that haven't appeared on 
[00:10:00]  television right you may have i've included yeah a clip from one of my comedy specials try to compare  yourself i've also been under media scrutiny everybody is sure yes i know what it's like to  have cameras thrown in front of my face too true i know what it's like to be locked in the prison of  my own life yes true your prison used to be a lot bigger though you've lost a lot of weight yes i  have if the prison's in you that's right yeah yeah well what does she do do you want to fuck a murderer 
[00:10:30]  specifically or that murderer you know what not just any murderer because most of them are fucking  not very uh because a minute ago you said i want to have a story of how i fucked a murderer  yeah yeah i kind of do because see then then we're starting to get more towards that's kind  of fucked up yeah i don't know like like i think you're more attracted to casey anthony  yeah because of the case you think i think so no you know what this chick amanda knox is a lot hotter 
[00:11:00]  she's a lot cuter than than casey anthony is you find casey anthony a little run through the mill a  little ridden hard and put up wet you know a little she got a little more mileage on her  kind of a thing what's that mean run through the mill and how does that i never heard that before  run through the mill and hung up wet oh oh i ridden hard and put up wet yeah that's a horse jargon  okay yeah you can't you're supposed to walk a horse around after you ride him and he sweats a lot 
[00:11:30]  uh or else he could get sick so you kind of just walk him around the the stable until he cools off  yeah but if you ride him hard and put up wet he's gonna have a short you know short usefulness i  literally thought that was a laundry term really yeah something like hard and then put up wet i  thought it meant hanging clothes when they were wet oh no no it's a horsey term written hard and put  up wet yeah my dad taught me that one jesus christ since we learned but yeah i learned a lot back then 
[00:12:00]  what else did you say i'm sorry no that was about it you know there were all the fucking horse  terms but who the fuck knows don't be a faggot i guess was one he told you that one yeah  keep the colored girls away he didn't want to come home with a no what do you have done if you came  home with a black boy oh my god you were 12 as this is my partner i honestly do think he would  have killed uh both of us yeah wow really yeah yeah i think he would have shot murdered yeah yeah  murdered murdered maybe a fucking no maybe first a sound thrashing like a real fist beating to both 
[00:12:30]  of you uh well probably yeah yeah and then if uh hopefully he would be thinking well hopefully that  broke him of that fad you know and then if i continued uh what if you said daddy i was born this way  oh he i don't think he would oh he would have been oh oh okay now i'll accept it right now i don't  think my dad would have been very accepting of a gay or interracial or gay interracial 
[00:13:00]  preferred more i come home with a man or a black girl uh oh he would have preferred a black girl  absolutely what if it was a man me being gay was like the the that would have been the worst thing  that could have possibly happened what if it was a man or a black girl or an accused murderer  of children oh he wouldn't mind the accused murderer i don't think it's like she was fun 
[00:13:30]  white only accused yeah it's only accused accused yeah if she's out obviously you know you could talk  it out and say she didn't do it kind of a thing you don't think your father would have been  understanding oh i don't think so no how about if he just if he walked in the barn  and uh and the boy was just kissing your neck like standing behind you and holding you in his arms  i don't uh no i don't think that would have worked no the oddest thing was like that hurdle the richard 
[00:14:00]  hurdle was thrown in front of him like uh-oh like here's his friend and now you know i my whole my  whole existence as the father to young anthony has been to keep him from becoming gay you know  he grew up a pissy-eyed little crybaby uh playing with the doll as he said it was a puppet thank you  i just hadn't put strings on it yet but it was a puppet not a doll and uh and then it's like you  know his whole goal was oh my god i gotta keep him from being gay and then the one fucking best 
[00:14:30]  friend i make out in california is a gay guy yeah that must have been to my dad like  son of a bitch what the hell he's gotta be a gay guy imagine the guilt he would have gone through  if you hadn't pretended to be asleep that night oh my god and then and then he walked in and your  dad was like oh he's like guys i got more graham crackers for you oh no and he walked and he climbed 
[00:15:00]  up the little tree fort ladder and be like ah and trying to like it's like scurry and hurriedly  pulled my pants on the smell of of teenage boy breath on your cock or 12 year old boy breath  because he would have heard it but he would have heard it before he saw it he would have heard like  oh and and fucking young anthony oh is that what i sound like yeah and he probably would have heard  your head like as you you were like banging your head on the fucking tree fort floor and  you would have heard like the little eucalyptus tree would have been shaking a little bit 
[00:15:30]  that the tree fort was in yeah yeah and it would have been his fault for letting you up in that tree  fort yeah with richard he should have known better he would have thought yeah yep yep still probably  yeah he uh he was a little leery of richard and he always made a point of letting me know  that he knew something was a little weird with richard really yeah yeah did he like richard uh  yeah he did because you know we had known him for quite a few years so it would have been very hard 
[00:16:00]  for him to just kind of you know and it wasn't his son so he didn't give a shit on that front but  but it was kind of like he'd be like hey you know you see richard uh shopping with cory the other day  you know are they buying some curtains and i'd be like yeah curtains right faggot i get it dad i get it  did you ever tell him that richard offered to suck your cock no no that wouldn't have been a good uh 
[00:16:30]  conversation starter would he have turned that around all that in the morning evening over dinner when  he's yelling at you for something else right right hey by the way yeah you put me in a tree fort with  the kid who offered to suck my cock and i let him would he have turned and just the offer like  if you had told him that the offer was made yeah would that have made you gayer for having been  offered that to that's a good question i don't think so i think i think he'd have gotten a laugh  out of it like weird it doesn't make much sense but uh yeah yeah he would have thought it was funny 
[00:17:00]  yeah yeah and i'm sure things got back to him like uh the the buzz situation because once we were  all drinking at the uh stables there and uh and buzz of course it was my first romance uh my first  uh woman romance is that what it was yes yes she it was a romance chato reyes was a little too drunk  to fuck so she decided to fuck me chato reyes chato he was uh one of the reyes brothers one of the reyes 
[00:17:30]  brothers there was juan chato uh and i guess a victor or something was chato the little hairy one  that would come in uh when the sleigh stacks were bothering you chato stinks chato reyes no they were  all uh the mexican uh brothers that had uh horses at the uh same stable you know and they uh they drank  a lot too and um yeah they were always looking to fuck you know whatever kind of women were around 
[00:18:00]  the stable area so buzz was you know buzz was there and uh one time buzz suggested that me and richard  kind of double teamer you know really yeah yeah yeah and uh i was into it you know i'm like yeah well  let's let's go let's fucking get this done how old were you uh maybe 14 i guess 14 and uh and  richard for some reason was just kind of like nah nah nah i don't think so i bet i can figure out the 
[00:18:30]  reason why uh there wasn't enough cocks involved oh one pussy too many that's probably why richard  declined i think so you think because of the the pussy involved how great would it have been  if you when you were telling your dad you told your dad right uh-huh and then he's like yeah  richard offered to suck suck my cock uh-huh and your dad's laughing uh-huh you and then you were  like and then i let him yeah that fucking hand how quick would that laugh that burly calloused hand 
[00:19:00]  would have come across my face it would be that american beauty scene oh yes where uh yeah just beats  his son yes beats his son don't give up on me dad oh my god are you disappointed that richard said no  what are the threesome um well i i left with buzz anyway and uh had a liaison with uh buzz uh but uh  i don't know i thought it would have been kind of cool to do at that point yeah yeah that would 
[00:19:30]  have been very awkward though to be banging buzz and be like why do i also feel a mouth on my balls  yeah and then look down i was like richard what are you doing no i said in her ass  what a good guy richard was oh yeah he'd have he'd have him i i guess um i guess he he went off with  joey butt licker after that uh and me and him kind of i didn't really hang out that much after  he hooked up with joey butt licker because joey butt licker is the kind of guy that would just do 
[00:20:00]  anything yeah well yeah yeah did you hurt your feelings when richard was hanging out with joey  butt licker uh you know what as a friend yeah i kind of felt a little like uh jilted you were scorned  that um because me and richard were friends for for quite a while yeah and um and uh you know we did  everything we went fishing together out there in dana point a lot of horseback riding just basic  shenanigans smoke a little weed you know and just kind of talk about things and and then uh 
[00:20:30]  and then i guess uh that gay thing kicked in sure you know that that switch switched on it was like  hey oh no right so uh i guess i wasn't giving him what he wanted you know dick gay sex right dick  uh yeah so he went with joey butt licker was the real name was joey butler but that sounds really  similar to butt licker and why why the nickname out of all the nicknames exactly why did he call him 
[00:21:00]  joey butt licker well butt licker works for butler like that's what you would say as a kid but also  someone who eats other boys asses is probably yeah yeah i would think yeah joey butt licker and of  course the story i've told it here right on this very airwaves of joey butt licker the story that  richard told me about joey butt licker which is a little odd now that i think about it too because  like like why would richard tell me this because all i could conjure up there weren't any girls in 
[00:21:30]  the room is this image of of richard in the same room with joey butt licker doing this and and you  know why you're there why how did this get started yeah joey butt licker um took his pants and underwear  down and sat on his the one of the four posts on his bed it was a nice um lathe tooled uh bed post  and it had a little ball thing on on top and uh he sucked that thing right up right up into his anus 
[00:22:00]  and uh richard told me the story it's like you know what joey butt licker and all i'm like like wow  that's fucked up never thinking why were you in a room with joey butt licker when he put the bed post  up his ass bed knobs and broomsticks up his ass crazy you know i'm more hearing in that i'm like  how do you do that without like i've had massage therapists just finger my ass a little yeah and i  feel like i'm gonna shit on their finger i just can't take that you're not a champ how do you do  that without shitting talk to joey for advice i mean talk to joey butt licker he'll tell you 
[00:22:30]  hey when a therapist puts in a finger and i have to tell her to stop ah it's so great about that  do you ever wish that you would let him blow you that way you could still be friends you could  still go fishing no you know what i don't think that would have been enough anyway i would have  been like now you blow me let's have some butt sex it's gotta it's gotta escalate you know when you  got the likes of a joey butt licker taking a bed post up his ass oh yeah and and getting the 
[00:23:00]  nickname butt licker something tells me there were other things going on there and he might want a  more tenderness than you were going to offer anyway some handholding yeah joey butt licker might not  have been as ashamed of his affections richard maybe he wanted hugs from joey butt licker to hug him  joey butt licker oh god but i i i assume they were you know going at it like full gay right full gay  which to me full gay is ass sex yeah i was thinking they're they're probably having some uh some ass 
[00:23:30]  sex jealously no good no i was just kind of you know there were a couple of uh richard was a very  very good looking guy and um and the girls were constantly swarming at him me on the other hand  ah kind of funny looking and you know with the acne i looked like i had taken in a shotgun uh to the  face so i really needed some personality time i needed uh to kind of but richard was good to get the 
[00:24:00]  girls over you know he pulled the girls in and then i could work a little you know magic there you were  more of a young confused boy who's uh who's awkward yes and whose personality is what would get the  girls yes yes but it was very hard to just drum up a conversation uh you know you can't cold call  these girls uh so richard would just have him swarming they loved him well high school girls are 
[00:24:30]  always the last to figure out when a dude is gay they just think he was he's great yeah i mean talks  with them about things and nobody is better than a gay guy in high school at picking up high school  girls oh my god the drama club guys yeah they would get all the girls but you know by get it just meant  sit with them at lunch and and talk about like uh very effeminate things i had like a handful of  obviously gay kids in my high school that were sitting a handful yeah or a mouthful yes but they 
[00:25:00]  but they weren't out but you knew they were gay you didn't know they were gay from the time they  were right yeah but they always had every girl was like oh yeah i'm dating so and so and you'd be  like he's gay he's gay guy he's a gay guy yeah also because they're gay they they're different than  every other guy in high school because they're the only ones not trying to fuck the girls so their  energy women can't believe how girls couldn't believe how their energy was so different yeah oh my god  he's cute and he likes me as a person and he's interested in the same it's like you have no idea 
[00:25:30]  the thing that makes you a woman makes him physically ill right yes yes you disrobing  he would just be meh meh it's nothing does nothing also not pressuring them for sex yeah oh they  probably love that too like he just wants to hang out and talk oh then the first head row they get  it's just like god this guy's a monster yeah he's all over me won't get his fucking hands off me  yeah richard richard would bring the girls over and then i'd have to do that and then he would just 
[00:26:00]  like they would literally be chasing him like like and trying to touch him and he would be like  no no oh stop stop stop yeah yeah yeah yeah how old is it when he died when richard uh died of the  aids yeah uh 40 i guess oh boy oh boy no he didn't die of aids he died of pneumonia oh of course  yes yes yeah when you're 40 especially i guess he had moved to uh lake elsinore out there in 
[00:26:30]  california uh he might have had a uh a partner a partner and uh that was that i didn't even know  for years oh really yeah were you sad when you found out uh yeah a little bit i was like uh you  know that's a shame that that ass sex had to fucking you know imagine it was joey butt liquor right  from the start like god damn first fucking time and he caught it from that bed knob yeah who knew  back then that's where age started on that on that patient zero joey butt liquor's fucking bed post 
[00:27:00]  it was a fucking bed that they ordered from like zimbabwe and they had no idea that a fucking monkey  had bled on it and then he shoved it his asshole that's how age started fucking joey butt liquor  yeah started the aids yeah i felt a little bad i was kind of like oh that that sucks you know  boy with the heyday of getting aids the fucking late 70s early 80s just fucking like a madman i guess 
[00:27:30]  yeah because he was one of them uh male models so uh man he must have been a handsome guy oh boy they  must have just been fucking fucking and so big bottom too yeah sorry the bathhouse he was very  femmy so he would have to have been the chick and the thing and um you know there's a documentary  recently on on aids on guys who survived it and it was uh about san francisco and the whatever  they i forget what they call that district um tenderloin district or there's something 
[00:28:00]  something else is called where the gay are rump roast yes but there was all these guys talking  about when aids hit in the fucking and how they had no idea what it was and they showed like a  picture of these guys looking at a sign in the window like they they had put up a sign be careful  this this the gay cancer oh yeah no yeah the free dicks i was replaced by gay cancer and uh it was  really fucking interesting how aids snowballed and how yeah gays are the only ones who are responsible 
[00:28:30]  because everyone thought it was a gay disease yeah yeah yeah gays had a tough one with that for  quite a while wow fuck reagan wouldn't even say it right wouldn't he not even say no no i don't i  don't give a shit yeah that's pretty much what it was yeah yeah a lot of people kind of just thought  it was the gay disease and left it at that gays were pretty much shunned caster quite a while  is it called caster what's that the the uh okay the castro castro the castro that's where it was i 
[00:29:00]  think oh the castro in san fran yeah row boy just fucking ravaged huh oh fuck jesus nobody knew what  it was that was just a horrifying point they would feel these like uh they would go on these these  medications and these like uh experimental things yeah and it would either help a little bit or kill  you faster it was a rough time for gay men yeah well i didn't mean to take a fun discussion and  just fucking wreck the morning show it wasn't that fun you know talking about richard taking in the ass 
[00:29:30]  and dying that's true i just really revealed something about myself today  i didn't mean to kill every heart out of the room  yeah he had to have been a fucking like bottom oh oh just getting fucking pounded oh he was my  pal but he was definitely a bottom though my pal getting pounded in the ass a lot a lot yeah and well  taking a lot of dick yeah yeah i don't think you would have given it to him he probably he probably 
[00:30:00]  wouldn't have done very well as a top because um there were there were quite a few times uh buzz  buzz would would pull his his towel off of him when he was showering buzz would pull his towel off  and he would run upstairs he would run away from her well he wanted nothing to do with her she  didn't have a dick exactly and uh he was he didn't have much going on there oh his penis was small  yeah yeah oh no such a handsome guy a little infantile um ill yeah yeah a little soft small 
[00:30:30]  so he probably was just like well i'm gonna have to let my ass do all the work yeah let your asshole  do the talking let your asshole do the talking exactly he's like ah well i don't even have to  roll over you know and and show this fucking disgraceful cock just stay on your belly and  fucking take it yeah i just don't know how guys take it i don't i really don't anything in my ass  fucking wrecked me it's probably a good thing that you you know i don't know i wouldn't i don't want 
[00:31:00]  to you think if you enjoyed it and were able to do it your ass wouldn't be all stretched out by now  i'd be right now on the floor my spine would be on the floor and you'd be like where's your chair  fucking i know i i tried it with uh a couple of doms i tried to have yeah years yeah i just  with strap-ons i just couldn't do it man that's like my ex-tribe yeah yeah couldn't do it and they  were little little ones yeah they weren't big what it looked like a little pretzel stick yeah 
[00:31:30]  little teeny one i had one uh one girl who was massaging me and uh she had a a fucking strap on  and she would slap it on my ass it was really dirty and hot and i would feel her her pussy and  she'd be soaked the gas was so the hot part was reaching under it and feeling how soaked she was  yeah like this was she was just getting paid but doing that was so fucking dirty it turned  yeah she she that just to me seems like uh it's just too close to the gay uh well i fucking i she 
[00:32:00]  was trying one time she was putting it in and i had gas and it fucking and i felt like i just kept  talking no more but then she pushed a little too far and i was just like oh no when she pulled it out  and some gas came out and i was like oh sorry and she's like oh no she went oh god her hand 
[00:32:30]  dude it was putrid i was amazed she recovered as fast as she did she's fucking around with that  fucking part she's got to know you know maybe yeah you queefed out of your butt dude one of the  chamber it could go off humiliating yeah i guess so that was humiliating that knocked me out of that  game for a long time that put a scar on me that's like no more of this yeah yeah that just to me seems  a little uh a little weird yeah not weird weird i mean so but as far as sex goes if you're uh in 
[00:33:00]  your own fucking place doing whatever whatever the fuck you want to do but that to me seems like  there's a a want of something that's a little it's hard to explain what what it would turn me on  about it it was just so inappropriate like it's the it's the it's it's the feminine role in a a  sexual relationship to be the one that is penetrated to be the one that is uh like dominated in that  fashion so even if you know you'll you know what's going on there's that underlying kind of thing of 
[00:33:30]  yeah it was fun though yeah it was fun though so fuck it she had a great body yeah she wouldn't  let me fuck her no yeah no that's why you know we were kind of limited oh wow she was a fucking  professional huh i really wanted to do you think you'll ever uh get past that uh point and be able  to enjoy taking a big dildo in your asshole i don't think so i haven't tried in a long time i don't i  don't think i don't even know if i'd want to at this point yeah i don't need to open that door 
[00:34:00]  yeah some doors you just don't want to open yeah all of a sudden i don't need to like figure out  the formula and go oh my god now i got it you would just be a madman oh you'll find a new  fetish or something that starts turning you on after 40 after 40 i've exhausted most options  now it's armpit smell or foot smell and all this weird stuff you'll find that you'll find the secret  to take it in the ass and just nothing oh then you're off to the races you're just sitting here  with a fucking butt plug in doing the show that's a dangerous thing is what's next because with you it's 
[00:34:30]  always like once you master this you got to figure out what's naughty that you haven't done so  you know you're not that far away from taking a live dick in the ass as long as there's a female  in the room or something you'll convince yourself that's a that's a huge jump there's not even  implications but risks and that there's a huge jump from a real dick to a woman with a strap on  that's a that's a that's not that's not a logical next step the logical next step after a woman  fucking with a strap on is not a guy fucking you and what is what is the next step it's something 
[00:35:00]  perverted with her a bailey jay that's a good call yeah it's something dirty with her it'd be like  you blowing the strap on or something oh what do you would it be oh what are you supposed to do  to put a strap on in your face say get out of here excuse me jesus you you goddamn criminal  that's an odd thing too sucking a strap on yeah it's not yeah i know it sounds odd but it's really  not no it is no it kind of is it's odd as in it's not orthodox but it's not uh a gay activity 
[00:35:30]  i know it sounds like it it's emasculating believe me it feels like it but it's gotta be a man  it is an emasculating thing part of that's really what's what's hot about it really being so dirty  yeah it's it's always it's it's her it's her attitude about her dirtiness transcends the  you're taking on that feminine role but it does though because what else can't hey well you know 
[00:36:00]  you've done it so you understand i did oh i didn't enjoy it i wasn't uh fair enough but you know i didn't  do it on camera either so it all kind of comes out in the watch like you did it on camera didn't enjoy  it i've done it in private and and came like the fucking like the god of coming pointed  it's not that weird though it sounds like it's crazy but it's yeah it's just you keep one-upping  yourself with a why not take on a feminine role with a girl it's just different how many different 
[00:36:30]  i guess you just get bored doing the same shit all the time uh yeah that's why people go out and  cheat because they get bored yeah yeah yeah you think it's out of total boredom no i'm not saying  that but i mean that's it's just when you know when you keep doing the same stuff i mean you i i don't  know maybe i'm just a complete twisted i think you're a fucking degenerate as far as your sexual  habits go yeah you don't have to keep one-upping it though no no there's nothing wrong with that 
[00:37:00]  who the fuck am i to say we all got our demons don't we yeah now we're lurking and hiding i wouldn't  look when she would massage me no i just i just knew she had it it was just so dirty like under  her skirt i was like oh you fucking dirty girl under her she would come in with it on she did  once or twice twice yeah in a nurse outfit that would be too imagine she got hit by a car crossing  the street downstairs no no no no it comes up in a big strap-on dildo no i guess jim norton's  fucking address in her hand no she would do it i would always do it on the road she'd know she was in 
[00:37:30]  uh in the in the in the bathroom she'd put it on oh she'd bring it in her purse oh of course i  would say when i was a kid her purse a book what talking about your mommy's purse a book purse a  book i would say those cringy words because it's like a pocketbook in a purse yeah but you said that  on purpose like to be cute yeah to be silly you don't like this it's so stupid i'm just stupid  jimmy i would call the police mr copper policeman what's that you're trying to get a little attention 
[00:38:00]  for yourself what does that even mean just because you wanted everybody to stop and say that's not  the word yeah what are you saying i was very young i would make mistakes like that were they mistakes  or were they on purpose to try to be cute yeah yeah you were trying yes i was yeah how did you how  did you well i've heard the stories and stuff but how did you do with girls during your school  career terrible you did terrible yeah fucking horrible really yeah funny guy nothing yeah it was very uh it 
[00:38:30]  was very rare to actually get a girl so when you did it was so like oh oh that you just i became  obsessed with like every girl that i went out with in my uh school days and and it was like the most  important thing in my life at that time friends family everyone took a back seat to my little  fucking relationship yeah because i thought if this one goes away if i lose it that's it i'm not getting 
[00:39:00]  another one ever again in my life i had a big crush on this girl when i was in high school that we  used to hang out like i would hang out with her family and i just was in love with her and uh i would  always get drunk and tell her i loved her i was a real burden a burden and we were hanging out like  all around a campfire one night and like her brother was there swimming her in the tent making out  and my mouth was getting dry because i was drinking so i just kept drinking like  so i kept drinking like mouthfuls of like whiskey or or uh or vodka whatever i had and i would drink 
[00:39:30]  it and get my mouth wet and then i would just keep making out with her and she went out to  she went out to sit with her brother at the campfire and i was like i wonder if she's coming back in and  he was gonna go and she's i remember hearing her go no no don't leave don't leave  oh no oh that's bad what did you do just sat there 
[00:40:00]  did you feel all sad oh i was so embarrassed i just sat in a tent drunk  oh don't leave don't leave don't leave don't go oh thank you yeah she kept her brother there  and you pretended not to hear yeah i had to you know she didn't feel threatened she just didn't want  to have to kiss me anymore oh i fucking love you oh and and being drunk it was even worse yeah 
[00:40:30]  yeah that's she come back in the tent i don't believe she did oh i went outside and just sat with  them why would she go back into the worst place on earth at that moment i had the bottle up by her  i'll never forget that i was taking a swig of the bottle it was up by her head maybe that's a  problem too you're fucking stop kissing her to swig booze you know what that must have tasted like  to her it's apparently not very good stole boozy breath yeah cigarettes and booze was she drinking  i think's apparently not enough i guess she wasn't yeah in a moment of clarity 
[00:41:00]  oh yeah that whole fucking thing back then and it was just this this overwhelming need to keep the  girl and and that would just fuck things up because you were so possessive oh and would always end in  fucking severe heartbreak oh my god was i fucking oh i went through my entire fucking dating career in  in junior high and and high school like fucking just just heartbroken oh would they always fucking do 
[00:41:30]  that with my friends why why  because you were a little wiener i was why else would they oh was i a little cry baby  fucking bitch went to a party once and then one of my my fucking girl my girlfriend is like gone  it's like where'd she go and then you just you just walk around the house like fucking 
[00:42:00]  like william h macy and boogie nights trying to find her and then you know she's all of a sudden  just appears outside a room oh and then some guy is fucking you know walking out behind her  oh and you're just oh she's just hanging out you get just total denial oh oh god you had that  where she was yes then you go and hang out with her for the rest of like the party of course it's  my girl oh what a fool you kiss her hold her hand yet she was juggling some guy's fucking bag 
[00:42:30]  on the fucking on the bed what a fool that's horrible what a buffoon what a mark what a rube  yeah did you know when you were like denying it or you really didn't know i knew because i was mad  but you pretended you were like well if i don't confront her on it maybe it's not real if i  confront her right she will get mad we'll have an argument she'll leave and this guy's right there 
[00:43:00]  to fucking scoop her up why would i do that that's stupid so if i'm nice and everything we're still  together and should just fuck me should just fuck other people behind my back yeah yeah yeah and at  that point in my life like the idea of my girlfriend being with someone else was like the most  devastating thing on the face of the earth worse than like parents dying that kind of bad the worst  fucking thing ever yeah so when it you know you found out it did happen and it was over it just 
[00:43:30]  became this overwhelming paul depression fucking for months and my mother be like snap out of it  what's the matter with you you don't understand you're like aj in season six  yes right yes he was in that massive depression it's amazing when when the the pain it causes when  a girlfriend that you think has fucked somebody else confirms it oh that's the then you cannot 
[00:44:00]  once you hear it you can never unhear it it never leaves your head it's horrendous oh it's so  awful when that when that confirmation like yes i did fuck him at the party  the last time i had that i was 30 yeah i was fucking 30 and a girl i was like oh  devastating wow how long were you with this girl a couple years oh it was a couple of years i don't 
[00:44:30]  think she cheated on me i think we were like breaking up and we knew we were starting to see  each other again yeah and we were driving and uh we were listening to this song and the song was  called hooker oh and so she was asking me like have you been with any hookers or whatever i'm like no  whatever i forget and that's how the conversation went you don't want to go there you don't want to go  in that direction of hey who have you been fucking yes but i did oh shit and it turns out like oh boy  she was fucking this guy i was so devastated because you just can't get the image out of your 
[00:45:00]  head no you just picture the guy banging the shit out of her her doing the things and making the  noises that she made with you and then oh it's just the worst it's a confirmation that you're a loser  yes it's a confirmation that little jimmy norton is not good enough to hold on to this  it's not worth being faithful to god it's a tremendously awful confirmation and now all  i want to do is hear about guys they're fucked that's all i want to hear about i don't get that 
[00:45:30]  either it's just dirty it's pornographic yeah it is dirty but it's guys at once yeah all right good  let's go out and have dinner no it gives you a creepy feeling i don't know i don't like it i  wouldn't like it if i was dating her at the moment yeah like i like hearing about stuff before me  not dirt i don't want that during my dating yeah some of the uh if you're if you're breaking up with  a girl though you better damn be sure you can handle the fact that she's going to be fucking  somebody that's the worst part because that's what they do that's that's why you hold on because  you don't want to picture anybody else with her that's the only reason you hold it if i knew like 
[00:46:00]  if i break up with you she'll never sleep with anybody else yeah i would dump girls all the time  yeah yeah he wanted yeah dumped yeah i don't know if you're um that's why i i if i break up  with somebody i can't even fucking see or talk to them for quite a while before i could even delve  into maybe like having some kind of a friendship thing you can't just go right into friendship  because you still got that lingering relationship thing where you know yeah i don't want to see who 
[00:46:30]  the fuck you're fucking then after a while you could just be like who cares let him deal with her  bullshit let him yeah he's fucking her but he's also got to deal with that you know the first time  like if you're just friends and you're hanging out then you're like hey come on let's go out and  she's like no no i can't tonight you're like what are you doing she's like oh no i got some stuff  and then you're like oh she's going to see somebody else oh and then you start getting relationship  jealous again and then it just puts you in that shitty pattern oh yeah yeah yeah i can't do that no  that's terrible what do you mean you're not around oh yeah i have plans vagary you get a little vagary 
[00:47:00]  yeah no i got i got stuff i gotta do i can never understand when a girl would have plans and then  not choose me because i was like so obsessive about the relationship yeah yeah that i would  always choose the girl i was dating like there's healthy people that can go like no i can't see you  this weekend i got plans with my friends yeah and i would be like what like how could you not put  this obsessive relationship over your plans with your friends wow that's exactly it would drive me  crazy like when a girl would have plans i always felt betrayed whether she was being disloyal or 
[00:47:30]  it would hurt me like because i would never think of doing no oh so i guess i love you more than you  love me but the reality is that's just healthy right oh i was in the most unhealthy relationships  because i would just obsess and i would not like every every day of my relationship was dedicated to  the relationship like i didn't have any real like other thing to do anything else in my life was just  peripheral to the obsessed fucking relationship i had with a girl just to have just to have the 
[00:48:00]  relationship yeah a lot of these girls i just didn't even really like but i was so obsessed and  infatuated it's so how ghoulish it's pathetic too because then what happens is it wrecks the relationship  of course it does because you start getting resentful when they have plans with other people like well  how come you're not seeing me and then all of a sudden you start building these scenarios in your head and  they finally become self-fulfilling it's like you know i wrecked so many more relationships by being jealous 
[00:48:30]  my right eye is so itchy it really is tearing i'm where i'm the afrin is wearing off tearing up  i took afrin the last few days oh you did it's wearing off and i'm itching inside of my sinus like  behind my eye is itchy yeah you you got something no it's my afrin this time oh it is yeah it's  fucking driving my right eye crazy look at it it's all cute oh it looks like teary jimmy no i'm not  sad it's just i'm on here you are that's how crazy i am you want to eat a little bit yeah let's have

I bleach brown hair sometimes.  Okay, you do that. What is it you want me to do for you?  Want nice, big hair with a lot of body.  Body?  Get a hairstyle, look like a hot stew. 
[00:53:30]  All right, I can give it a try, but I can't make no promises.  I get tears for fear.  So who's for what?  I get a frack of a cigar.  What's that, like a fecal or thing?  Do not like not attractive to a female.  Whatever you say, karate kid.  How about I take some off the sides, leave it long on the back?  Look like a Bay City roller.  Yeah, sure, whatever you say.  So, uh, no ladies in your life?  When trying to get an American girlfriend. 
[00:54:00]  So that's why you're here.  Well, you gotta just keep trying out there, buddy.  Eh, hungry like the wolf.  Yeah, well, there's a sandwich place down the block.  Well, there you go.  What do you think?  I look very sexy.  Yeah, right.  Great.  Look good.  Glad you're satisfied.  All right, Fu Manchu, hit the bricks.  I get on the skateboard. 
[00:54:30]  Wrong boy.  He forgot his fucking glasses.  Hey, buddy, you forgot.  Yikes.  That's not what I meant when I said a little off the top.  Continues.  Well, this is funky. 
[00:55:00]  Any reason, E-Rock?  Nope, nothing today.  All right.  Good.  I didn't want to pick up the list and look.  Try to figure it out.  I don't like playing these E-Rock games.  What is it?  Hmm.  You don't care why E-Rock plays something?  No.  I don't really care that much.  I, you know, I enjoy his selection for the most part, even when it's thematic. 
[00:55:30]  I'm usually not concerned with what the theme is, though.  No, I don't really care about a theme, an underlying theme.  Let it go unsaid.  Although we can look back.  Remember that President Bush landing on that aircraft carrier?  Yeah.  It feels like it was 10 years ago.  Doesn't it?  Yes.  Mission accomplished.  Yeah, he flew in.  He had his giant ball bag pants on, where he had his flight gear strapped, and his dick 
[00:56:00]  and balls were all pushed forward.  Yeah, look at the picture on the, go all the way to the right there.  Yeah.  Look at my, look at my balls.  And my pricking balls is, mission accomplished.  My balls look big.  When you look back, that's slightly an embarrassing moment.  Yeah, yeah, it is.  Him in that dumb gear.  Yeah.  It's like, what are you doing?  I want to land on a carrier.  It's going to look cool.  I'm going to look like a badass. 
[00:56:30]  Mission accomplished.  Digging balls on display.  Yeah, put my balls on display.  Fly in, get out of that plane, go, mission accomplished, badass.  Is that what he said, mission accomplished?  Mission accomplished.  Well, it's the big sign on the carrier, it's a mission accomplished.  And, you know, ten more years.  Mission wasn't accomplished.  No, it wasn't.  Still fighting.  Unless the mission was just to get in there.  That was such a faux pas and fodder for the left when he did that, man. 
[00:57:00]  Why would he do that?  It was the dumbest fucking thing.  Normal combat operations have ceased here in Iraq.  Mission accomplished.  Look at my balls.  What happened after that, though?  Like, right after that?  What had happened?  The Republican Guard, National Republican Guard had surrendered?  Or, like, what had happened that caused him to say that?  They had ended the actual combat.  Not combat, obviously, a lot more combat went on, but I guess it's, they went in, did the 
[00:57:30]  little shock and awe, and kind of broke up Saddam's government, regime.  And then they just had, they were occupied.  Then it was just an occupation at that.  Right, because they beat the regime.  But then the people themselves were like, no, fuck you guys.  Well, yeah, there was still a lot of insurgents.  Yeah, but they take that.  They took Baghdad. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Mission accomplished.  Look at me.  Nobody went home.  No.  Now, and then he put on the suit.  I guess he went to his quarters and put on his little suit.  Maybe, can I wear the thing that makes my balls look big even with my suit?  I won't come out.  He wears a nice suit, but his balls are still all pressed.  This was 10 years ago today.  Yeah.  He did a little wink. 
[00:58:30]  Hey, how you doing?  A little winky-duty.  Thank you.  Thank you.  He thought this was going to be a very proud moment.  Oh, this is going to be the big thing.  And it wound up being, like, what they used against him.  Thank you very much, Admiral Kelly.  Yes.  Captain Card.  Captain Carl.  ...and sailors of the USS Abraham Lincoln.  My fellow Americans.  That Budinsky carrier.  Major combat operations in Iraq have ended.  In the Battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  We prevailed.  Do you know, can you pause this?  We're going to pull out.  This is as embarrassing as when you watch the Middle Eastern countries, like the Iraq fucking,  and I remember Tariq, what's his name?  Oh, the, uh, Tariq Aziz?  No, the Baghdad, Baghdad Bob, or whatever they called him.  Oh, yeah, the information minister.  The information minister.  There is no Americans at the airport.  That is so great.  They tried to come in, we pushed them back, and we're on the airport. 
[00:59:30]  That guy was the best.  It is embarrassing.  Yeah, when you look back, and then, you know, you fast forward seven years, it was still happening.  Still going on.  Still, uh, uh, just a hotbed.  People were sent to Iraq years after Bush said mission accomplished.  What year did you do that ten years ago?  What are we in?  We prevailed.  Yeah, that was 2003.  I went there after that.  Yeah.  We were sending in Jim Norton to Iraq. 
[01:00:00]  Mission accomplished.  Let's hear a little more of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And now our coalition is engaged in securing and reconstructing that country.  Good luck.  In this battle, we have fought for the cause of liberty.  Ugh.  And for the peace of the world.  Oh, boy. 
[01:00:30]  Our nation and our coalition are proud of this accomplishment.  Coalitionate willing.  Yet it is you.  The members of the United States military who achieved it.  Your courage, your willingness to face danger for your country and for each other, made this day possible.  Mission accomplished.  Because of you, our nation is more secure.  Is it?  Because of you, the tyrant has fallen, and Iraq is free. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, boy.  Wow.  It's amazing.  Wow, what a faux pas.  What f***ing nonsense.  Iraq is free.  We're sending in shiploads of construction material for McDonald's and Burger Kings, so that people can understand what it's like to be free.  Mission accomplished.  Look at my balls.  Want some more?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just like it because I don't know how bad it is, right?  Thank you. 
[01:01:30]  They love us.  They're coming with flowers in their hands.  Yeah.  Bombs on their chest.  Yeah.  Operation Iraqi Freedom was carried out with a combination of precision and speed and boldness.  And big balls.  The enemy did not expect.  Like mine.  And the world had not seen before.  Shock and awe.  From distant bases or ships at sea, we sent planes and missiles that could destroy an enemy division or strike a single bunker. 
[01:02:00]  Marines and soldiers charged to Baghdad across 350 miles of hostile ground.  In one of the swiftest advances of heavy arms in history, you have shown the world the skill and the might of the American armed forces.  Yeah.  It's just pretty much...  This nation thanks all the members of our coalition who joined in a noble cause.  Coalition to the willing.  We thank the armed forces of the United Kingdom. 
[01:02:30]  Yes.  Australia and Poland who shared in the hardships of war.  We thank all the citizens of Iraq who welcomed our troops and joined in the liberation of their own country.  There was Mohammed and Mohammed.  I have a special word for Secretary Rumsfeld, General Franks, and for all the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States.  Uh-oh.  What is it?  America is grateful for a job well done. 
[01:03:00]  Job well done.  Now get me on another plane and off of this.  This wreck.  All right.  Yeah, I guess that's enough of that.  Enough looking back.  Fucking...  What a disaster.  Yeah, he sure did jump the gun on that one.  Yep.  Perhaps he should have been a bit more humble.  Uh, but it was so important when, when all this news started coming out and the doubt about weapons of mass destruction and everything. 
[01:03:30]  He was getting so much shit.  Oh, is that the, uh, information minister?  Yeah.  It's very quick.  Okay, what's he saying?  They are not near Baghdad.  Don't believe them.  They are nowhere.  This is silly.  This is silly.  They cut that guy a pass.  They did?  Yeah, they didn't lock him up or kill him or anything like that. 
[01:04:00]  I had some information.  Didn't make him a, uh, murderer.  Him and, I think, Tariq Aziz, too, right?  Oh, yeah, Tariq Aziz was the, uh...  He was, like, the guy that...  Ambassador?  Yeah, he was an ambassador, so they, they left him alone.  But, uh, it was a wild time, though.  Man, that was some, you know, shit would change by the minute.  It's amazing how much...  Bill Maher said, and maybe he said it for different reasons...  I'm an asshole?  He should.  No, he did not.  Oh.  He was, uh, he said that we should just put Saddam back in power and have egg on... 
[01:04:30]  He said we have egg on our face, and he was right.  We should have just put Saddam back in power.  Like, instead of dealing with these fucking, this shit country, Saddam knew how to handle  Iraq.  Well, yeah, yeah.  Brutality.  That was how he, that's, it was not our place to go over there, and I was wrong.  I, I've said it many times since.  Yeah.  I was wrong.  He was that loose cannon that would stumble into a sovereign nation, uh, that boarded his,  but, um...  It wasn't our business.  You know, who cares? 
[01:05:00]  It was all, it really, you know, it's like, I, I really think that we were protecting  Saudi Arabia, um, I think that they were next after Kuwait, and that's what we were worried  about.  I don't think he would have the balls to do that.  Oh, I do.  Like, little Kuwait is like, man, Saudi Arabia's pretty fucking big.  They suck.  He could have taken Saudi Arabia with his fucking, with his fucking hand tied on his back easily.  Because they, they don't fight polite like we do.  Bunker busters, they just shoot everybody.  Ha ha!  Shoot everyone!  Yeah.  What a mistake. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, that, that's a weird thing.  That whole fucking area just, for, forever, just stinks.  It's just the bane of the globe's existence.  Yeah.  That whole area.  Now we got Syria, and, uh, I guess Obama gave a little presser yesterday, a little press  conference came out, and he was asked a few questions about Syria, and, uh, the, uh, the  idea that they, they, they had crossed the red line by using chemical weapons over there  in Syria, and then he, he went on to try to explain what the red line was. 
[01:06:00]  Now, initially, his, his definition of this red line was, you know, they, they shouldn't  cross it.  Once they did, the United States would have to take, uh, Syria's further action.  And now it's, um, well, uh, we're gonna look into this deep, the red line meant nothing.  Good.  It meant nothing.  Which I don't think it should anyway.  Like, fuck them.  But you can't say shit like that then.  He should have just said, eh, fuck them. 
[01:06:30]  We don't care what they do.  But, but, to say there's this red line, and then you're not gonna cross, and then, and  then they cross it, and you go, well, next red line.  What are we gonna do, send troops into that fucking shithole?  No.  To protect those people that hate us?  Who gives a fuck?  It's not our business.  Not our business.  It's not our business.  Yeah.  Stay out of other people's fucking business.  I think, uh, the, the, the problem with staying out of their business over there is, uh, one, oil. 
[01:07:00]  Oil, man, I don't mean like that.  You know, the corporation's making money, man.  No, oil.  We run on fucking oil.  That's, that's the fucking bottom line.  Sorry.  We run on oil.  We need to have a relationship with those savages over there to get their fucking oil.  It sucks.  And then the other one is the, uh, alliance with Israel.  You know.  Too bad.  We've hammered that one out.  Israel can handle themselves.  Let them take care of themselves. 
[01:07:30]  They're not a weak country.  They're a strong country.  Let them do what they feel is necessary.  I'm just tired of it.  I'm tired of it.  You're an anti-Semite.  No, I'm, I'm just tired of us interfering with the rest of the world.  We've become the annoying cunt of an ant, uh, minding everybody's business and telling  everybody else how to live.  Do you think someone has to be for the stabilization of, of everything in this, in this world?  No.  You don't?  No.  I don't.  You don't think other people that haven't gotten rambunctious because there is a superpower  wouldn't like buck up and start being assholes? 
[01:08:00]  Like, I think that, I don't like the idea of the United States having to be the world  cop, but, um, it seems like someone's gotta be.  We have soldiers everywhere.  Yeah.  We have soldiers in Germany.  We have soldiers.  Why?  What are we doing?  I don't want, I don't want our soldiers in other countries.  For what?  It's alliances and business.  Yeah.  It comes down to, you know, hey, we got our guys here, you know, to help your economy.  How many foreign bases are here?  In the United States? 
[01:08:30]  I don't think there's any.  None.  Nuneski.  Tell your story walking, motherfucker.  Yeah.  I just don't like it.  No?  No.  Sick of it.  I don't care what other people do to their citizens.  I know that sounds crazy.  I'm just tired.  Because they hate us.  I don't either.  They don't care about us.  They don't, they don't like us.  They resent us.  Leave the Muslim countries alone.  If they want to fucking just chew each other apart, let them.  I don't mind.  If they want to live peacefully, let them.  I don't mind things like troops in Germany, because I think it's a kind of a goodwill gesture more than anything else. 
[01:09:00]  I don't think Germany has to worry that, you know, they're going to be attacked and our soldiers there protect them.  I think it is really just kind of a goodwill thing.  It's been in place for so long.  They're a very strong ally with us.  I think also having bases there does help their economy.  Right.  So that I have no problem with.  I do have a problem with sending troops to a shitty fucking nation that could give a fuck what we, what, about us. 
[01:09:30]  Uh, because their government is killing their people.  Who cares?  That's, you know, that goes on.  Sorry.  Sorry there's only like 70 fucking thousand deaths happening in Syria.  You know?  How many people have died?  I think so.  Wow.  Who cares?  But who gives a fuck?  That's like civil war.  It's fucking their battle.  Yeah, people die in those fucking wars.  It happens all the time.  And we got helped by, uh, France.  I guess because they didn't care for England. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  But we were grateful.  We, you know, we didn't all of a sudden hate France.  But again, maybe because they left after.  They didn't stay.  It was such a different time then, too.  You know, it's...  Yeah, and France got involved because it was in their best interest against England.  And so, it wasn't just that they loved us so much.  It's always self-interest.  Yeah, it's a self-interest.  So where is our self-interest going into, you know, some of these, some of these countries?  And I think that's the reason we haven't gone into Syria. 
[01:10:30]  Because there really isn't an interest there.  It's not like, um...  You know, it's not an oil interest.  It's not...  I don't know.  I'm sure Obama would love to send troops in and help out.  You think?  Excuse me for coughing into the mic.  But the people who were trying to help would want to kill us anyway.  Yeah, there's no...  The longer it goes on, the more bad elements end up on the side of the rebels.  So, when initially they start up, the rebels might have been, you know, people that were anti-government. 
[01:11:00]  And they wanted their country to be whatever the fuck they wanted to be.  It's never democracy.  Stop.  It's always some Muslim fucking shithole that they want to turn it into.  But now, like, any time there's a war over there, it's like a party.  Al-Qaeda joins in.  Taliban joins in.  Fucking all kinds of radical Muslims join in.  Just because they love fucking fighting.  And there's also a lot of Muslims that want Sharia law.  Let them have it. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Again, not my business.  You want to live in that fucking archaic, shitty existence?  Yep.  Good for you.  It's your right to do it.  You want to beat your women with sticks?  That's how you want to make them wear those fucking outfits where no one can see them?  Good.  It has nothing to do with me.  The only problem is, a lot of times, the Sharia law, they look at anyone else on the earth  that's living outside of it as people that have to be eliminated.  Well, then, as I've said before, our response to any type of infringement has to be barbaric. 
[01:12:00]  Swift and barbaric.  Like, literally, if there's any type of an action taken by the country, we destroy a  major city.  Yeah.  Like, that's the type of message you send.  Nobody bothers you.  It's such a hard thing to do, though, because it's never a nation anymore.  It's a fucking, you know, terrorist group.  It's so hard to, you know, when fucking Hitler decided to blitzkrieg his way across Europe, 
[01:12:30]  you knew there's a country, there's Berlin, the capital, and, you know, in order to win  the war, you have to take over and take the capital.  You get these fucking little groups of shitheads without a country.  Who do you blow up?  And then you try to blow up a country about it, and people are like, well, what do they  have to do with anything?  Yeah, they're harboring them.  It's just so much, yeah, it's so complicated now that there isn't this definitive target  anymore.  Why did, um, why does Zimmerman waive his right to stand your ground, by the way?  Oh, yeah, well, that... 
[01:13:00]  Is that to hear evidence first before he makes a decision?  No.  This is waiving his right, period.  Can he do it after the prosecution presents their case, though?  No, it's done.  You're waiving your fucking right, uh, from what I read yesterday, uh, it's done.  He, he's waiving his right.  He, he and his defense team never said stand your ground.  That's another media thing.  The media decided, hey, uh, it's, uh, stand your ground here in Florida.  Stand your ground, stand your ground, stand your ground, and then you just heard it all 
[01:13:30]  over.  The defense, I'm sure they, they mulled it over, but they never said that we're taking a stand  your ground defense.  Uh, a self-defense case and a stand your ground case aren't the same thing, you know?  This is a self-defense case.  You might be wrong about that, though.  Really?  Because he said, uh, after consultation with my counselor, yes, your honor, meaning he's  saying, like, he's waiving it.  Uh-huh.  The judge set aside two weeks to the end of April for an immunity hearing, should Zimmerman  want one, and the prosecutor had filed a motion asking that he make clear his intentions 
[01:14:00]  on whether or not he even wanted the hearing, and, um, his defense attorney told  the judge Tuesday there was nothing in the law that required the immunity hearing to  take place before Zimmerman's trial, and could be requested after prosecutors have presented  their case.  Oh, okay, because the prosecution was saying that once they waive it, it's done.  They can't revisit.  Um...  That's the prosecution.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm wondering if maybe they want to hear the evidence, uh, at a certain time if 
[01:14:30]  you don't want to play your cards on these fucking pre-trial motions or hearings.  An attorney, obviously, would know more than us about it.  Yeah, yeah.  So let's all these attorneys out there just call and give us a jingle.  Yeah, sure, sure.  Uh, yeah, he, uh, the stand-your-ground thing, it kind of doesn't even apply here.  It's not really a stand-your-ground, uh, case.  It's a self-defense case, obviously.  You know, as far as the defense says, his client was having his head bashed in on a  sidewalk and, uh, felt his life was being, uh, threatened at that point and, and returned, 
[01:15:00]  returned, uh, fire.  Uh, or actually didn't return fire, he returned, he returned his fucking, uh, his self-defense.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we'll see what happens there, but, um...  He got fat, too, in jail.  He did.  Yeah.  He's eating well, I guess, and, um...  Is he still in jail?  Or is he out?  No, he's out.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay.  He's out, but he can't really, I guess he can't really go anywhere. 
[01:15:30]  Is he wearing an ankle bracelet?  I'm not sure.  Chunky George Zimmerman.  They call him Chunky George Zimmerman.  He's right to stand-your-ground immunity here.  But why?  Let me see.  I mean, he is chunky.  Yeah.  What's that got to do with anything?  Nothing.  I don't get that.  Who cares?  Nagely George Zimmerman.  Oh, damn.  He's a little nagely?  Eric.  Sorry.  That ain't right.  Eric's a good kid.  We need to poke fun at Eric. 
[01:16:00]  I'm chunky.  Well, this was, um...  He is chunky, though.  I saw this, too.  CBS Houston blogger fired for posting that a cheerleader was too chunky.  Yeah.  So there, it's not okay.  That, yeah.  So, for Zimmerman, it's okay.  He's a chunky.  Yeah, because he's a white guy, and...  But a cheerleader?  Um, what is this bit of political correctness?  Well, that's all it is.  It was, um...  Oh, man.  That isn't the cheerleader, is it?  I think so, yeah.  She is not chunky.  No.  That girl is fucking, like, crazy. 
[01:16:30]  She's got a little chunk on the side there.  Not in a bad way, but it's there.  CBS Houston blogger.  Oh, that's her?  Oh, wow.  Okay, this picture's different.  Yeah, she is a little chunky.  A little chunk.  Especially for a cheerleader.  But it's not, it's not bad.  It's like thick.  Yeah.  Full and thick.  So basically, a cheerleader is, her job is to be sexy.  Yeah.  And it is to be, her physical form is really important.  Right.  So if you comment and you say she's beautiful, that's okay.  But if you're critical, you're fired. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  What a shitty fucking country we're turning into.  Is this the story?  Hey, can we, let's hear this story of this.  Lindsay Davis has the story.  She looks different, like every shot.  While the Oklahoma City Thunder's been winning games on the court, it's one of their cheerleaders  who's making headlines.  Kelsey Williams, a veteran cheerleader with the NBA for three years, became the focus of  a CBS Houston sports radio article posted online titled, Is This Girl Too Chunky To Be 
[01:17:30]  an OKC Thunder Cheerleader?  It was posted after last Monday's playoff game between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Houston  Rockets.  The columnist, Claire Crawford, even launched a poll asking readers if they think Williams  has the perfect look, could use some tightening up in her midsection, or if she has no business  wearing that outfit in front of people.  The article caused an immediate backlash with readers going on the attack against Crawford,  calling her a bully and a mean girl.  With one person tweeting, wow, it's possible for a woman to be a misogynist? 
[01:18:00]  Blogger Claire Crawford qualifies.  Another adding, shame on you, Claire Crawford, for your irrelevant, vindictive, and outrageous  comments about Kelsey B. Williams.  CBS Houston would only say that the article was taken down from its website on Wednesday.  And now several websites, including the Houston Chronicle, are saying that Claire Crawford  seems to be a pseudonym for Anna Megan Raley, a columnist for CBS Houston.  Raley once posted this video on the Houston Chronicle website when she herself auditioned to be 
[01:18:30]  a cheerleader for a professional soccer team.  I added my own personal style.  She didn't make the team.  Raley has denied writing the columns criticizing Williams, but that hasn't stopped critics from  lashing out with one person writing, women like Anna Megan Raley, aka blogger Claire Crawford,  who called cheerleader fat, are idiots.  Was she blogging under a fake name?  As for Williams, she's taking the high road, tweeting, thank you to everyone for the compassion  and love today.  I'm in awe. 
[01:19:00]  For Good Morning America, Lindsay Davis, ABC News.  You know what?  Does all mean buffet?  I don't think she should be fired for posting her opinion, but if she's blogging anonymously  like that, how'd she get caught blogging anonymously?  Well, I guess someone looked into it after this controversy.  CBS Houston hasn't confirmed that she is whoever she says she is.  Fucking cunt.  But then again, that's why people have to blog anonymously, because they get fired for shit 
[01:19:30]  like this.  Exactly.  It's terrible.  This woman should be able to just pose that question.  Who cares?  And it's like, hey, is she a little chunky for cheerleading?  Because again, the whole purpose of a cheerleader is to look good.  Right.  We're lying if we say anything different.  Yeah, yeah.  How come there's no fucking 400 pound cheerleaders?  Yeah, go ahead.  Why?  Find me some fat pig of a cheerleader.  So whoever picks the cheerleaders is just as guilty as this blogger is for writing that 
[01:20:00]  this woman's chunky.  Right.  Because nobody wants fat cheerleaders so you don't see them.  But if somebody says, hey, one of the ones you picked is a little too chunky, you're doing  body image crimes.  If you had a fat cheerleader go out there, the crowd would laugh.  Yeah.  They'd come out and the crowd would go, ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, and take a video and it would  be funny.  It is funny.  Look at this.  Look, look, look at this fatso.  This is a YouTube video with 1.8 million views.  Right.  Because she's big and fat cheerleader. 
[01:20:30]  Because this one cheerleader is fat.  Oh my God.  What is she doing?  Look at the fat roll sticking out under her.  That's because.  Wow.  That's because no one could tell her you're too fat to do this.  And she sucks.  And they're laughing.  That's a yes for everybody.  That's everybody gets a trophy.  Right.  Tell her she's beautiful.  But she's not beautiful.  She's a big fatso.  Damn.  You want to be on the cheerleading team? 
[01:21:00]  Fucking drop 30 pounds.  Look at the.  And look, they're just putting the camera just on her.  Look at her.  She's blubbering around all over the place.  She is a fucking.  Oh, look at the fat rolls coming out over her little cheerleader skirt.  She's just a big fatty.  She's fucking blubbering around all over the town.  She's terrible.  And this isn't a joke.  This is like.  Yeah.  She's serious.  Look.  Oh, she better not be top of the pyramid.  Oh, God.  Oh, look at her. 
[01:21:30]  They're all laughing at her.  Yeah.  There's.  Yeah.  This, this, this whole controversy, this outrage is ridiculous.  She's a fat fuck.  Yeah.  Not the one on Houston.  No, no.  No, the Houston one's fine.  Yeah.  But I guess you can't.  We don't want honest language.  No, we don't want honesty.  And, and they're not even being honest.  The, the people that are outraged.  Like, oh, misogynistic.  It's like, no, you would laugh if you saw a fat cheerleader. 
[01:22:00]  And, and this girl isn't fat, but just to ask, to put a poll on a blog and say, hey,  do you think this chick is a chunky?  He didn't say fat either.  No, calling her fat.  She never called her fat.  But if she is, why not?  But like, and the CBS lady's probably being a cunt anyway, because she's jealous she didn't  get on it.  Probably, yeah.  But why don't you go after the team for not having a fat cheerleader?  Yeah.  If you so care about misogyny, go after the, uh, go after the team.  She got, she got, she got some, some meat on her. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, she is a little chunky.  I'd still stick her.  But she, she makes up for it.  She moves.  She got a, she's got a cute face.  We do not want anybody to tell unpleasant truths.  No.  Oh, do we hate it?  And everyone comes to the rescue.  The white knights, they all ride in and, uh, and come to the rescue of these people.  For no reason.  You're a bully.  If you say anything people don't like anymore, you're a bully.  Oh, it's the bully.  Oh, stop bullying.  Especially where the internet's involved.  It's, uh, really an amazing, uh, turn of events we've had here. 
[01:23:00]  Any type of criticism of anything or anybody is now considered,  bullying instead of just an opposing viewpoint.  On Twitter, people will, like, someone will say something bad about me.  No.  And I bashed, I, believe me, it's hard to imagine everybody.  Jimmy.  But then I'll blast them.  Yeah.  And then sometimes the listeners get on them.  And all of a sudden, the cocksucker will go, yo, you're such a bully.  It's like, what you want to do is you want to say what you want to say. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  And you don't want anybody to respond.  No.  Especially if they respond, you know, uh, with, uh, criticism.  Yeah.  Of them or their, their profile pic or their family, uh, pictures that they've posted.  Here's the lesson you learn.  Respond.  Say what you want.  I don't want you to get in trouble for it.  But don't cry like a fucking bitch.  Yeah.  If people say nasty shit to you for it.  Bullying.  There's so many white nights on Twitter.  Are there?  Yeah.  Uh, for this, uh.  Talking to Kelsey. 
[01:24:00]  Kelsey.  Yeah, the cheerleader.  Kelsey B. Williams.  Yeah.  What are they, what are they saying?  No red-blooded man would say no to you being, being his girl.  If the U.S. doesn't want you, you're welcome in Australia any day.  You fucking.  I'm going to be a white night when I get this girl to come, Danny.  The blogger has deeper problems if you're a target.  Keep up the great attitude.  Kelsey B. Williams.  Yes.  You going to follow her?  No.  You going to white night yourself?  I would, I would follow her and then, um, go the same route as that fucking, that slutty 
[01:24:30]  beauty queen girl.  Just have the listeners fucking pound her.  Bitch.  This girl, this girl's nice.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm writing a nice little tweet.  Oh, are you?  You're tweeting her?  She has 4,600 followers.  Yeah?  Hmm.  4,600.  Oh, she must be getting a lot of followers today.  I'm sure she is. 
[01:25:00]  I bet.  Well, I'm just trying to make her feel better.  Oh, are you?  I bet I am.  Oh, Jimmy, you're so nice.  See, you're not a bully.  I am not.  You're making sure people, uh, they read your tweets.  You, you, you, you, you write feel good tweets.  I'm a supporter.  What'd you write?  Let's see.  Oh.  Travis Mayfell.  Let me have it.  Let me see.  What does it say?  You're purdy.  P-U-R-T-Y.  Not that fat at all.  Hashtag white knight.  Guys are such fucking assholes on Twitter. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, you know, that guy's just a jerk.  You're beautiful.  And if they won't take you, I will.  And they think it's going to be like, oh, who's this gentleman?  Hi.  Uh, are you free this weekend?  Yeah, I'm going out with the cheerleader girl because I said she was pretty.  The thing is, though, when you, when your whole thing is to be pretty and you're get, 
[01:26:00]  your job is, obviously she's athletic and she can dance or whatever is required.  It's not an easy job.  But it's your looks.  Right.  So you don't mind the compliments.  You don't mind if anybody blogged and said, how beautiful is this girl?  Uh-huh.  You don't mind that.  But if it's a negative truth, you can't handle it.  Yeah.  What is wrong with us?  And then even when you, you tell a girl she's pretty, like, was it Brent Musburger?  Oh, there's an issue.  That, yeah.  Then you say that a girl is pretty and you get in trouble. 
[01:26:30]  There's nothing you can do anymore without people getting this phony outrage that they get.  Because, I mean, really, look at it that way.  There's this girl.  Is she chunky?  Ah, there's outrage.  There's Brent Musburger talking about that fucking quarterback's girlfriend.  And, ah, there's outrage that he fucking was reacting to her beauty.  Yeah.  You're not supposed to say anything about anyone anymore?  Oh, a woman's attractive. 
[01:27:00]  Well, don't mention it.  Oh, that woman's not attractive.  Well, don't mention it.  She's fat.  Ah, shut up.  She's skinny.  Ah, don't say it.  But she's a cheerleader, so her looks do count because that's what she's making for living it.  But then again, this guy's girl's a model, but she's Mrs. Alabama, whatever state it was.  Yeah, yeah.  So they're both people who are not just, they're making their fucking, their whole thing at this moment is to be beautiful.  Is what they look like.  So don't say they're beautiful, and don't say they're not.  Right.  It's retarded.  What a country of fucking cunts.  Just assholes in this fucking country.  You wonder why we hate each other. 
[01:27:30]  I can't stomach people.  Beyond me.  Ugh.  Just love to complain.  Yeah.  I mean, me.  Yeah, we really do.  Well, she's not too chunky to be sure.  She's sexy.  And I, you know, the CBS lady is probably a twat who's jealous.  I bet she's so jealous.  So jealous.  Are they giving her some support, at least, I hope?  Yeah.  She is pretty.  Kelsey is pretty.  Yeah.  What's her profile pic? 
[01:28:00]  Let's see.  Uh, what?  Uh, oh.  Well, now see, she's a lot thinner in that one.  I bet she goes up and down with her weight.  I bet she's a, you know, she eats a little bit, and then she, uh, eh, she goes up in weight.  And she diets.  I don't know.  She's pretty, she's pretty hot.  What is the, um, the real name of the CBS person?  Uh, hang on. 
[01:28:30]  Let's see if she has a Twitter.  Oh.  I don't know if it's her or not, but.  Yeah.  I'm kind of curious.  Uh, her real name is Anna Megan Raley.  We'll see if she has Twitter.  I will.  Does she have a tweeter?  Yeah, let's see.  Because, uh, yeah, I think maybe the fans should, uh.  I don't even know if it's her, though.  Yeah, we.  I don't know who cares at this point.  I'm not saying if it's her.  Internet bullying.  Why won't they say if it's her?  I don't know.  Why won't these networks ever say that?  Like, why wouldn't they name the person who, who switched, uh, the Zimmerman audio? 
[01:29:00]  Oh, they protect their own.  Yeah, and CBS, why are they protecting the, like, you know.  No, they'll only say that they fired Claire Crawford.  Are they saying that?  Yeah, I mean, Claire Crawford was fired, but CBS won't say if Claire Crawford is  Anna Megan Raley.  Claire Crawford's a pseudonym, right?  Yes.  So, if they fired a fake person, great.  So, they discontinued the blog, is what they really did.  Yes.  They probably didn't fire anybody.  They probably don't want to fire the woman. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Well, no.  A spokeswoman says, the CBS Houston blogger who publicly ridiculed an NBA cheerleader for  her weight has been fired.  Publicly ridiculed?  Is that publicly ridiculing?  Let's go to the Annie's.  Is that a girl on Twitter?  I'm trying to find it.  Yeah, let's see.  I think we should see.  Wow, that's really fucking...  Publicly ridiculed.  You're being a bully.  Yeah, you're a...  But meanwhile, it is okay if you're People Magazine to list the most beautiful. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  That's okay.  Yeah.  Sure.  Publicly, you know, again, we don't want truth.  We want to praise somebody.  But don't be nice.  It's like, we are just a...  The whole generation is fucking, make me feel better.  Tell me good things about myself.  Yes, Tros?  Well, both of those Twitter accounts have been deleted.  Ah.  I bet they were getting some flack. 
[01:30:30]  A little bit of flack.  But hey, they won't say whether or not they're the same person.  That pom-pom's, like, making her look thicker, I think.  Sure.  Because it's hiding where her hip is kind of...  I don't know.  She's fine.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I mean, these two photos are from the same game.  Yeah.  And she looks far thinner in this one.  Right.  Than this one.  There's nothing wrong with that. 
[01:31:00]  No.  What are you talking about?  I'm writing a blog about her, though.  Yeah.  It's called Do a Sit-Up Pig.  Are you using your own name or a pseudonym?  Oh, God.  I would never want to say that.  Aren't you...  Like the People Magazine, 100 Most Beautiful lists and all that shit.  Aren't you insulting people by not including them?  Of course you are.  So, it's an insult and it's bullying by not including certain people.  Although they do include fat people and fucking holy people.  Yeah, but it's bullshit. 
[01:31:30]  Again, we just don't want people to be truthful.  No.  All we do is train each other to lie and have fake politeness and fake compliments.  Fake outrage, too.  Fake outrage.  Yeah.  None of it's genuine.  No.  What?  How did we get here?  Jesus.  How do we fix this?  Is it just a cycle that's got to, like, go through in Americans?  Will it ever go away?  Will we get back to being brutally honest with people and them being able to handle? 
[01:32:00]  Just being able to handle things in life.  That's why everybody's pouring fucking prescriptions down their throat.  Because no one can handle anything anymore because we don't have to.  You just get outraged and you get a bunch of people that crucify the person that criticized you and you don't have to deal with being criticized or being insulted. 
[01:32:30]  And the second you are, you've got to go to the psychiatrist and get fucking drugs to pour down your face.  I was bullied.  Yeah.  You're a cheerleader.  All you get is compliments and people wanting to fuck you because of how good you look.  Yeah.  How come cheerleaders don't wear a fucking long sleeve or midriff covering shirt?  Because they're fuckable and hot.  Look at the girl behind her.  Look how much of her ass is fucking being covered.  Barely any. 
[01:33:00]  It's great.  So it's like, we're going to stand up here and dance to make you want to fuck us because we contribute nothing.  Really?  Is that the cheers?  That's helpful.  That is it.  1950.  But what are they doing?  I know.  What do cheerleaders do?  They're leading the cheer.  Yeah.  Waving that stupid pom pom.  Team that you paid to see and you're going to root for anyway.  They're there because they look hot. 
[01:33:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  And they do.  But do not give an honest assessment if it's not pleasant.  No.  A fucking nation of fakes drives me nuts, man.  Bunch of fucking babies.  A nation of fucking babies and fake compliments and fake outrage.  I'm willing to get online and on Twitter and stuff,  and if someone has gotten something nasty to say,  you just fucking nasty them back. 
[01:34:00]  Or just block them so you don't have to hear them anymore.  But it's not this big thing where you want to shut down everyone's ability to insult somebody  or to criticize somebody.  But that's where we are.  What a bunch of babies.  What a formerly great nation we live in.  We live in the formerly great nation of the United States of America.  That's it.  It used to be great.  I don't know what the fuck it is now. 
[01:34:30]  We're just inconsistent.  That's what bugs me.  We constantly say one thing and mean another,  and then act like our motives are always good.  Yeah.  Just be truthful about it.  No, we don't want that.  No, we don't.  No one wants the truth.  Don't tell a fucking unpleasant truth.  We don't want to hear it.  It's a fakery.  Why does everybody lie?  Why are people not telling the truth?  You're kind of fat.  You're fired.  Exactly.  Oh, that's why. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  What do you got, Travis?  Just reading some other people who may or may not be fans of this radio show.  What?  Oh, they're tweeting Kelsey B. Williams?  I likes chicken.  I likes liver.  Meow mix.  Meow mix.  Please deliver.  Oh.  I don't know why.  That's not insulting.  Yeah.  I would stuff Kelsey B. Williams' fat fart box.  She's not fat, though.  I know.  She is actually pretty.  And the blogger was stupid.  Yeah, yeah.  The blogger's obviously got an axe to grind, as they say. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  She's jealous.  She tried out for cheerleader and didn't make it.  Haven't we all?  Yes.  Cheerleaders are hot, though.  Just dumb, fucking dumb, dancey moves they do.  Looks all sexy.  Ugh.  And they get paid next to nothing to do it.  Oh, they should.  Oh, yeah.  Cheerleaders don't make any money.  They shouldn't get anything.  They make, like, 50 bucks a game.  It's more of the exposure.  Shuka, shuka, shuka.  Shuka, shuka, shuka.  Go team. 
[01:36:00]  I hate them, and I hate the mascots.  How much entertainment do I need?  I'm watching a fucking game.  You don't like the mascots?  No.  You don't think they're funny?  Never.  Never.  They don't give you a laugh when they walk out on the top of the dugout or something.  How about we have...  Go ahead.  No, I'm just saying.  They walk out there, and they pick a fan, and they put their hand on their hip and shake  their finger at them.  Oh, you.  Very accusingly.  You don't like when teams do, like, the sausage run in Milwaukee?  No, I don't. 
[01:36:30]  No?  I don't even know what that is.  It's one of our live events.  Well, that's what Richard used to do.  The sausage run.  He like fucking peckers.  He did.  He's dead now.  Want to take a little breaky?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They come out, and they run.  They'll return.  Like a number.  What is that?  They look like duties.  Who's going to win?  What?  They look like duties.  No, they're like long logs.  They have to run in those outfits?  Yeah, it's something to do during one of the half innings.  Why is it a sausage race? 
[01:37:00]  I don't know.  Is Milwaukee known for sausages?  But, like, I could see they got a chef.  But the other guys don't really.  Oh, this looks really stupid.  Do they fall down?  One, two, three, or four.  Do they fall down?  You want to see the video?  Is it funny?  They're all online.  They're all.  Oh, how much fucking shit do you need to look at?  Exactly.  Past first base. 
[01:37:30]  Here we go.  Sausages.  Oh, they're sausages.  Oh, okay.  I didn't understand that they were sausages because they're dressed like people.  They all look like people who've had that fucking new face surgery where they had a face put on.  Like after the chimp ripped it off.  Yeah.  Number two, Polish.  Number two, Polish.  Number three.  Almost ran into the umpire.  The announcer.  What's going on here?  You can't figure out what's going on. 
[01:38:00]  Number two, Clements.  Yeah.  Polish.  You all paid to watch a baseball game.  Now you're watching jogging dildos.  That is stupid.  You don't like it?  Yeah.  That fucking sucks.  Do you want to see one of them falling down?  Yes.  Of course I do.  If it's into a meat grinder.  I would love one of them to be killed.  Why is this funny? 
[01:38:30]  How great would it be if he was paralyzed in the ambulance and they had to come and fucking  put that duty sausage on a fucking stretcher?  He gives the thumbs up as he's leaving?  No, he can't.  He's below the neck.  That's true.  He was paralyzed.  Bad news.  The sad news from the ballpark.  The man whose dreams were to become an actor, who is now pretending to be a Polish sausage  with feet and arms and eyes, was paralyzed when he tripped over the ankle of another 
[01:39:00]  failed actor.  Children were seen crying and fans were praying and gave an applause as the duty sausage looking  creature was loaded onto a stretcher and wheeled off to the laughs of many.  Never to be heard from again.  Never to be heard from again.  No one cares about him.  I guess it's no better or worse than the stupid subway race that they do at Yankee Stadium.  That dumb YMCA dance that the ground crew does. 
[01:39:30]  All right.  Take a little break and shall return.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  This is the O.B. Anthony channel on Sirius XM.  This is the O.B. Anthony channel on Sirius XM.  Yo, my nigga.  You know about the Twinkies sundown, son?  That shit was off the chisel.  Yeah.  Fuck.  No more Twinkies, kids? 
[01:40:00]  No more cup chisels?  Damn, yo.  What kind of cakes do you like, kid?  I love a good clergymerc.  Damn.  What the fuck is that?  That's a cookie filled with spinach.  Come on, son.  I never heard of that.  You can't even get a cherble anymore.  I used to love a good cherble.  Huh?  It was wet tuna fish and dry flaky coconut.  And what you do is you put a cherble on each cheek and allow them to dissolve in your mouth.  Ooh, that shit is crazy.  Why the fuck would you eat that, yo?  That shit ain't even dessert, son.  I like the red asphalt.  What the fuck is that? 
[01:40:30]  It's a chocolatey, delicious treat with a lot of Tabasco sauce in it.  You're lying, son.  It's delicious.  Nigga, you don't want PCP, yo?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Damn, little Jimmy.  You're crazy, son.  The Opie and Anthony Show continues.  Ooh. 
[01:41:00]  E-Rock's going a little weird with the music.  Sounds very spy-like.  Dad's not home.  What?  Yeah.  That's why.  Yep.  Dad's not here.  So, uh...  So, he figures he can...  He left him 20 bucks for pizza.  Right.  And the night is his.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  You feeling less pressure today?  E-Rock coming?  Yeah, a bit.  Oh.  What does that mean? 
[01:41:30]  What do you say?  You feel more pressure?  You, Anthony, as an authority figure?  No.  No, it doesn't.  Okay.  Well, Anthony, substitute teacher Kumia.  That's what it is.  The substitute teacher's in.  Hey, can I go to the bathroom?  Yeah.  We're going to watch a movie.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're going to watch a...  Not even a movie.  It's a film strip.  Yeah.  Charlie, the 80s?  Film strip?  Did you ever watch a film strip in school?  We had VCRs.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I did.  All right.  E-Rock watched the film strip.  When I was in elementary school.  It was right when they were phasing that out. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Why don't you do it?  Yell, hey, teach, and spit a spitball?  Now, come on, Trav.  No.  You don't remember the film strip?  I don't recall a film strip.  When I was in fifth grade...  Yeah, I remember VCRs.  One of my teachers had a laser disc.  Stop.  Yeah.  It's impossible.  That's the first time I ever saw a laser disc.  Somebody had a laser disc player in the school.  But yeah, we had VCRs.  I don't think those are doing very well.  I just bought a laser disc player.  Just now?  How's that working now?  Can you get movies on it? 
[01:42:30]  It's a bad investment.  I just put all my money into laser disc player storage units.  I dumped all my money into that.  All your assets.  At least it was a little more successful than the mini disc.  That was a flop.  Which one was the mini disc?  A little cassette?  Yeah, little CDs.  Oh, CDs.  They thought it was going to take off.  It was like the CD almost wrapped in a floppy disc kind of thing.  Sony's thing.  Because it was recordable, and you know what I mean?  It was like all one thing.  I bought one.  Yeah, I used to record sets on it.  Wow.  Jimmy, do you recall film strips? 
[01:43:00]  I don't think so.  I'm your last ditch hope.  I know.  I'm Anthony's last hope.  You have to remember that.  How did a film strip look?  A film strip was, it was film.  He's literally in a reel-to-reel, right?  No.  I do remember those.  No, it came in, it was film that looked like camera film.  It came in a little canister like that, coiled up, and you'd open it up and put it in the  film strip projector, which was just, it looked like a movie projector, but there  weren't reels on it. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, right.  I saw that on the Wonder Years.  Did you?  Yeah, it would have been on the Wonder Years.  I do remember those, yeah.  And, um...  You know, I kind of remember them, too.  Yeah.  From the Wonder Years, though.  And there was an audio thing that played with it, usually on a record player.  There was a record player...  Record player.  ...that went along with the film strip.  And as the record played, it would be like,  And the circulatory system consists of the heart, veins, arteries, arterioles, venulas, and capillaries. 
[01:44:00]  And then there'd be a beep, and you would have to advance the film strip one frame.  Like, someone had to actually sit there and, um, and turn the...  Yes, you're right.  They had that, but they also had the...  It was the slides.  Well...  The carousel of slides.  Yeah, but I remember slides.  People had slides, and people even at home had slides.  The film strip projector was exclusively for school. 
[01:44:30]  No one at home had a film strip projector.  So it was, uh...  Yeah, and you would just keep advancing whenever that beep happened.  Yeah, I remember this.  Oh, I'm gonna have to sign it.  Yeah.  I think the most impressive thing is that Anthony just remembered all that shit about veins.  Oh, the circulatory system.  That's amazing.  And the pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins.  They definitely didn't have a turntable at school.  No?  Nobody was playing vinyl records.  Now they'd be like on...  And the circulatory...  Yeah, they'd be like, oh, this is cool. 
[01:45:00]  They'd be cutting it up.  Fucking cutting up that goddamn film strip projector audio.  Ah!  Crazy.  Oh, now they use all with the fancy computer.  Hey, spaceman, tell me your story.  Ah, what the heck are you talking about?  You remember that regular Joe?  Yeah, sure I do.  A good film strip, a little record to get your information, you go home.  Where's my lunchbox?  Look at that.  I got my cupcake.  I got my sandwich.  I write right back to the playground.  You learned what you needed to.  The, uh...  I come there for education, not for fun.  The three R's, right?  Yeah, read and write and arithmetic. 
[01:45:30]  What the hell's with all you guys?  Reading and writing and racism.  Yeah.  Oh, you guys with your eye...  Your eye hats, your eye puts...  Eye what?  Ah, what the hell's this with the inner tubes?  Eye pants.  Oh, go futts.  Go futts.  We also had, like, films.  You know, you had films, right?  Where you had a projector?  Or was everything VCR?  No.  Wait, wait, wait.  Why would you have a film?  A film projector with an actual movie on a reel that you'd thread through and...  You'd have turned the lights out.  No, I saw it in the Wonder Years. 
[01:46:00]  And this is Hemo the Magnificent.  No, that was almost your name.  Yeah.  If that damn Joey butt licker didn't get involved.  Then you'd have been fucking a homo, right?  Yeah, that's, you know, you usually didn't have to say it.  You could just imply that...  No, it was all tapes and VCRs.  And you'd just put the tape in.  Yeah, I'd be for tape and stuff.  And then you'd be like,  Hi, I'm Mark Curry.  TV's Mr. Cooper.  And this is your system.  Jesus Christ.  You know? 
[01:46:30]  No, there were so many things that needed to be...  Like, the AV...  The AV department in school had, like, all kinds of shit.  It was regular movie projectors.  Like, 8mm and then another one.  They had a bigger one.  And then there was a filmstrip projector.  Yeah.  And there was a slide projector.  And then the overhead projector.  That was the shit.  Now, you remember this?  Well, that was what...  It had, like, the plastic sheets.  It was glass, right? 
[01:47:00]  And it had the little mirror triangle thing at top.  And you'd pull the screen down on the front of the room.  And you'd put, like, things on there that were clear.  You could write on them in, like, some kind of wax pencil thing.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Yeah, and you'd do that.  You'd get there before the teacher's there.  Oh, yeah.  Or if she leaves the room.  Uh-huh.  You could just put a middle finger right under the overhead projector.  And it's on the big screen.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  For everybody.  You are a caution.  Fuck you, bitch.  Wait a minute.  Just kidding.  As a kid. 
[01:47:30]  Did you ever have to bring down the screen in front of the class?  Yeah, only for the overhead, though.  They weren't writing any wax pencils.  Like, they had, like, markers.  The same way you'd write on a dry erase board.  Yeah.  And you'd just write on the plastic sheet on the overhead.  Do you remember Dittos?  I remember that.  Dittos, yeah.  Like Xeroxes, yeah.  No, not Xeroxes.  These were Dittos.  I had to explain a Ditto.  I had to explain a Ditto yesterday to a young lady.  We were watching Fast Times at Ridgemont High. 
[01:48:00]  When she said, I hate those people, and you said Ditto?  Yes, as a matter of fact.  It was watching Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and they pass out the Dittos, and you see  everybody at once picks it up to their nose and goes, and smells it.  Right.  Because Dittos, they smelled cool.  What was it, the ink that made them smell it?  I think it was alcohol that was used in the ink and the chemicals that were used in the  printing procedure.  Did you ever have to go to the main office where they had the Ditto machine and it looked 
[01:48:30]  like something out of the 1800s?  Yeah, it was a big drum, like a metal drum that would rotate.  It would go, and just spit one Ditto out at a time.  So Dittos were, each one was kind of had fresh ink on it.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  We just had a Xerox machine.  And I always, for the longest time, I thought that a Xerox and a Ditto were the same thing,  because the teachers would still call them Dittos.  They'd be like, pass out the Dittos.  Well, that's because they were around during Dittos.  Dittos were weird.  Sometimes Dittos would fuck up like the letters would be all mushed together and shit, because 
[01:49:00]  it was like a powdery ink thing.  It wasn't very clear.  The Dittos were never very clear.  So you had to explain to somebody what it was?  Yes, I was like, oh yeah, you used to hold it up.  And she was like, why would you do that?  I was like, because they smelled kind of cool.  And it was just, I might as well have been, you know, talking to a spaceman.  That would have made my dick hard immediately.  A girl being, because I wouldn't have known that means she's too young to remember. 
[01:49:30]  Yes.  That would give me a fucking permanent rod.  Well, it did.  Of course it did.  You mean it was life before iPads?  Yeah, but that was like, that was some of the gear.  When you think about it, all you need now is a computer.  Right.  You have a computer and a display at the front of the room.  That takes care of everything you need to show the class.  Movies, fucking slides, if you want pictures, whatever it is. 
[01:50:00]  But, um, yeah.  Our AV thing was literally, somebody would just have to go down to the AV room, and they  made a bunch of TVs on big tall carts with wheels under them.  Oh, the dumb fucking rolly cart.  And a VCR connected to it.  Yeah, I remember.  You still get the TV with the VCR.  I remember those, too.  I remember the TV being wheeled.  It was old, and it was black and white.  What?  And I did watch the launch of Apollo 7 on it.  I, um...  Oh, it's Clinton getting sworn in. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, you did?  Yeah, when I was in third grade.  See, I remember.  That was 1968.  Yeah.  Not the Clinton thing.  See, they wheeled in this...  Apollo 7!  There's been so many more Apollos!  What Apollo?  You remember that?  I remember.  They brought in a television to our classroom.  They made a movie about Apollo 13, and it's still watching Apollo 13.  I'm like, that never happened!  And that's six Apollos after that. 
[01:51:00]  I do, as a matter of fact.  Who was the commander of that?  Was that Lovell?  No.  That was, um...  Don...  Don Sherman.  William Shera.  Yeah, William Shera.  Our crew was commanded by William Shera, Command Module Pilot Don F. Easel.  And Walter Cunningham!  Walter Cunningham.  Yeah, yeah.  And it was a big event, so they wheeled the TV, and we all got to sit...  ...and watch the launch of Apollo 7. 
[01:51:30]  Just a short 45 years ago.  Yeah.  Wow.  What?  Wow.  Wait, no way.  Yeah, you were in high school, and you watched them do that?  This October, it'll be 45 years.  I must have been in first grade or something.  Yeah, sure you were.  And you also remember when they fucking launched Sputnik.  I do not!  Wait a minute!  Yeah, that's funny.  You couldn't be more specific than that.  Maybe it was Apollo 8.  I don't know.  You got the name right. 
[01:52:00]  Maybe it was Apollo 8.  Yeah, I remember...  Which was the one with Lovell before 13?  Apollo 8 was two months after Apollo 7.  I don't know.  Sure, maybe it was that.  Wait a minute.  Which one did Lovell fly around the moon, but didn't land?  13.  No, that was like...  He was supposed to land, though.  This was just kind of a dry run.  Lovell?  Oh, wow.  Did he go around the moon first?  I didn't know that.  Yeah, he was... 
[01:52:30]  I think...  Was it Apollo?  He did Apollo 8 and Apollo 13.  Okay, it was Apollo 8.  Okay, so Apollo 8, as we've already discussed, was December of 1968.  Instead of October.  Do they have a launch time?  Like, what time did it launch?  12.51.  12.51.  P.M.  Yeah, that was the one.  Okay, that was the one I was witness to on the TV screen.  I was six months old.  I couldn't have been further away from a thought.  Exactly. 
[01:53:00]  All right, look.  You weren't even a load fucking...  No.  So you're saying it was like a month away from 69?  If you want to think of it that way, sure.  Sure, yeah.  A year away from 70.  It was only 11 years away from 1980, technically.  Look.  Like, 1969 seems like a goof to me.  Like, that wasn't really a year.  Is that a joke to you?  It's so far away from anything that, you know, is my point of reference.  With you, it's the same category as, like, the Titanic sunk in this year. 
[01:53:30]  World War II.  Any of that, yeah.  69.  I mean, this was before Woodstock.  What?  It was, uh...  Yeah.  Well, a few months.  Yeah, but before.  Look, I wasn't partying at Woodstock.  All right?  Like...  I was a little kid.  Do you know if in 30 or 40 years, whatever it's going to be, they're going to have a  news story.  The last person to see Woodstock live...  Oh, yeah.  ...has died today.  Yeah, yeah.  Like they do with World War II and everything else.  Oh, boy.  Like, I look at footage from Woodstock the same way I would look at my surroundings at a 
[01:54:00]  Renaissance festival.  Like, this is all, like...  This never really happened.  It's just, like, fake.  Like, and you could dress up like it.  Right.  And make believe.  Right.  You make believe that you were there, and...  Because it's just some...  There's no real point of reference.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Isn't it weird how you look at times before you were born, like, I can't believe everyone  existed without me.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, figure that out.  Yeah.  Some events from 1968?  68!  The Packers won Super Bowl II. 
[01:54:30]  Super Bowl II?  Super Bowl II.  The Super Bowls just always existed.  There couldn't be a Super Bowl II, because that means it's a new thing.  I don't remember that.  How could them...  The Super Bowl's never been new?  Rona Martin's Laugh-In debuted.  What?  Debuted.  Now, I do remember Rona Martin's Laugh-In, because my dad and mom, it was the...  They must have called a truce when Rona Martin's Laugh-In came on.  And I remember it fondly, because that was the time they just wouldn't argue and yell at 
[01:55:00]  each other.  And it would be on TV, and mine and Joe's room was kind of to the left of the couch on  the same wall that the couch is against, so they couldn't look behind them.  And we would sneak by the doorway and peek out and watch Rona Martin's Laugh-In to get  to see, because it was an adult dirty show.  And we would watch it.  Plus, you must have loved it, because your parents didn't argue.  No, they were laughing together.  And it was like, oh my god, they're actually laughing together.  This is insane, because they never did that. 
[01:55:30]  Who would they laugh at the hardest?  Do you remember?  Um, I'm trying...  Groovy.  Who was Rona Martin?  It wasn't Dean Martin, was it?  No, Dan Rona and Dick Martin.  Oh, Dick Martin.  They were like the two hosts, and then it was a giant ensemble cast.  It was a bunch of sketches and stuff.  Um, oh, you know what?  Could you look up news of the...  Rona Martin's Laugh-In, or just laugh-in news of the future.  Put that in Google. 
[01:56:00]  They used to do a thing, news of the future, dateline, 1980.  And this is 1968.  And they would tell what news was happening.  Uh, yeah, yeah, get this one.  Let's see how accurate it is.  Yeah.  This is 1969.  Okay.  Goldie Hawn.  That's Goldie Hawn.  She was smoking.  Yeah.  She was sexy.  You're being twisted for the complexities of certain...  Oh, thank you.  And our audience...  I remember, this is 1968.  The hair of the arrival of the one foremost practicing... 
[01:56:30]  They all made like they were drunk or stoned.  That's easy for you to say.  Sammy Davis Jr. comes out.  Oh.  She's kissing a black man.  That was crazy back then.  All right.  News of the future.  We forgot something.  Yeah?  What did all of that...  She said before that.  What did you mean?  What did me, ma'am? 
[01:57:00]  Here comes the man.  Oh, they used to...  Here comes the judge.  I had no idea.  All right.  They could keep you going like that for hours, but now it's time to settle down to some of  the more serious news.  Here's the news of the future.  Night.  Well, that's infectious.  Berlin, 20 years from now, 1989.  There was dancing in the streets today as East Germany finally tore down the Berlin Wall.  Wow.  The joy was short-lived, however, as the wall was quickly replaced with a moat full of  alligators.  Item, Washington, D.C., 1988. 
[01:57:30]  President Ronald Reagan today, tonight, once again, that he is a candidate for the office  of governor of California.  Wow.  That's fucked up.  They nailed the fucking Berlin Wall and President Reagan.  That's fucked up.  Wow.  Yeah.  It must be something to that marijuana.  Hey, suck it to me.  It was funny.  All the future news that they're referencing that really ended up happening, that stuff 
[01:58:00]  that really ended up happening, to me, is, like, old.  That's old.  The stuff that they're referencing in the future is old.  Is old.  Fuck.  God damn, that's weird.  They called it President Ronald Reagan.  Yeah, isn't that weird?  And they had the dates right.  88, he was president.  And Berlin Wall fell in 89, right?  89, 90, I think, right?  89, was it?  You ever see when Ronald Reagan says something like,  Uh, Mr. Gorbachev, do something and get rid of the wall?  Yeah.  I hate when people fuck up historical quotes. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, the laughing was a big thing.  I remember watching that.  What else happened in 1968?  Is when that was pretty much...  I actually do remember 1967.  I remember being in kindergarten, so I remember that.  I think the first memories I ever have are 1967, maybe the later part of 66. 
[01:59:00]  Do you know what I remember from 68, which is weird?  My room was dark all the time.  Was it a womb?  It was very dark.  Yeah.  And then I remember I had to walk through this really smelly door.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, shit.  Martin Luther King Jr.  Yeah.  Assassinated.  Oh, wow.  Whoa.  So if you ever wonder why there was a big party in your house, why did we have that big  party in 1968 when I was so happy?  Maybe that's why your mom and dad reconciled. 
[01:59:30]  Maybe that was, yeah, that was another time that they were happy and laughing together.  He gave her a good James Earl reign right in the hiney.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  This is history in the making.  60 Minutes debuted.  You know that show, Sam, that's just always been on?  Yeah, there was a debut for it.  Apparently.  60 Minutes.  That doesn't make any sense.  I don't remember that.  But I do remember, I remember watching, I remember my parents watching Star Trek first 
[02:00:00]  run when it was first run.  You were that kid going, what's a rerun?  I don't know.  But yeah, it wasn't a rerun as fucking, as a Star Trek.  That's right.  Yale University.  That's a fat black guy would come and dance in your room and you go, oh, that's honest.  Get it.  I guess.  That rerun Darren.  Yale University announces it is going to admit women.  Wow.  Damn bitches. 
[02:00:30]  You know when my first conscious memories start?  When?  I think 19...  60...  1987, 1988.  I was sober then.  Oh my god.  Wow.  That's crazy, dude.  I think 88 is around when...  That's crazy.  And of course, finally, the 68 comeback special for Elvis Presley.  I didn't watch that either.  Yeah, but you had the option of watching it.  Yeah, you could have. 
[02:01:00]  I had the option.  He had the option of fucking seeing him before the comeback.  Me and my parents also, and this wasn't an argument free because sometimes they would  argue during this, but we would watch Ed Sullivan.  I never saw Sullivan.  I didn't see the Beatles on Ed Sullivan, but I used to like Topo Gigio.  Topo Gigio was a little mouse.  Ew.  And he would be like, oh, hello, Ed.  It was like a little mouse puppet.  And you liked it?  Topo Gigio.  Yeah, I used to love that. 
[02:01:30]  And the guy that would go, sorry, sorry.  Senor Valencia?  Senor Winces.  What was it?  I think it was Senor Winces.  And Pat Cooper was on a lot.  And I remember laughing and thinking Pat Cooper was really funny on Ed Sullivan.  But I didn't understand what he was saying.  I just liked the fact that he yelled a lot.  Was he yelling back then?  And it wasn't at my mommy.  Oh, see?  Wait, wait.  Is this Senor Winces?  Oh my god.  I'm so old.  Gianni?  Gianni?  Martin.  Martin. 
[02:02:00]  Good boy?  Yes.  Good.  This is entertainment.  How do you feel today?  No good.  No good?  No.  Headache?  Yes.  Fever?  Yes.  Fever?  No, no, no, no, no.  Give me your breath.  I don't think so.  No, no.  Open your mouth, please.  Little more.  More.  No, no, no, no.  See, it's his hand.  It's his hand.  And he's opening his thumb against his forefinger.  And he's put eyes and a little wig.  He actually is pretty good at that, right?  Well, he was the best guy that ever did this. 
[02:02:30]  He's the only guy I've ever seen that.  He's actually a good venturgist.  He's singing as Senor Winces.  I find Topo Gigio.  Does he like Senor Winces too?  Yes.  I like Senor Winces.  Little Anthony wanted to be a puppeteer boy.  So I would watch and I would smile and laugh and be having such a good time.  And then my father would call my mother a fucking bitch.  And my mother would call my dad a fuck face. 
[02:03:00]  I remember she would call him a fuck face.  And then I would start crying and say I had a stomach ache.  And I just wanted to...  There's Topo Gigio.  I'm going Sarai, Sarai.  Sarai, Sarai.  Like, to me, that's just something people have always referenced that has no sort of...  It doesn't have a source.  People go like, Sarai, Sarai.  That's just what he's been around.  That was him.  Wow.  I watched it.  He's still alive, Senor Winces.  No way.  He is.  He's 98 years old.  No way. 
[02:03:30]  Just made that up.  You're lying.  He did.  He made it up just now.  I could see his face is breaking.  He gets excited when he thinks people believe him.  Did I tell a good fib?  See, here's Topo Gigio.  The Italian mouse.  Hello, ladies.  Well, Topo, now you can be...  You can actually really be happy because you have your whole family here in the country  with you.  Oh, yes, Eddie.  What are they going to sing?  Are you ready?  How racist this is.  And a one.  And a two. 
[02:04:00]  And a three.  And a four.  They're singing some Dago song.  But they're not singing.  They're just bobbing their mouse heads.  Why'd they do this?  Uh-oh.  Wait.  I think they're actually coming in at 9.30.  Yes, Vinny will be in.  Why?  Could you believe that this was entertainment for people? 
[02:04:30]  That millions of people gathered around the television and watched puppets sing this song?  This was stupid.  This was like the Tonight Show type of show?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Bigger.  I'm waiting for fucking Vito Corleone to slice that little puppet up this chair.  Antonio Andolini.  How annoying is this?  You turn on hoping to see the Beatles and you get the fucking Ginzo puppets.  The Ginzo mice.  Ya-da-da-da-da.  Look, he's carrying a chicken with him.  This is racist.  I'm offended. 
[02:05:00]  Why would they do this?  For kids, I guess.  What time was Sullivan on?  You know what?  Ed Sullivan was for...  I think it started at 7.  It was...  7?  I think so.  TV stations shut off.  It was there for the whole family.  So, you know, they had adult acts, which weren't really adults.  It was like the comedian stuff.  And then this was so the kids could enjoy something.  It was for the whole family, Sam.  So stupid.  Was it Sunday night?  What?  Yes, Sunday.  And the Wonderful World at Disney was on. 
[02:05:30]  Maybe this was after the Wonderful World at Disney.  What?  8 o'clock.  But find Pat Cooper on there.  And then Jacques Cousteau was on, too.  I remember that.  The undersea world of Jacques Cousteau.  Because you were a little explorer scientist, kid.  Yes, as we take the Calypso out to the briny blue, we sleep beneath the depths of the  wonderful ocean to look at...  I loved that shit.  Yeah.  Here is my son, Philippe, drowning.  I think his son, Philippe, died. 
[02:06:00]  Did he?  Yes.  And then Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.  You like that?  We would watch Wild Kingdom.  Marlon Perkins.  Marlon Perkins would go out into the jungle.  And Jim Fowler, right?  And Jim Fowler was his right-hand man there.  And they would show, obviously, staged animals doing staged...  Yes.  Find some Marlon Perkins, man.  They never...  I remember that when I was a kid.  They were never able to actually catch animals doing things.  They set everything up.  It was so fake. 
[02:06:30]  Street Sharks?  No.  What?  It was like a cartoon where it was sharks, but they walked around and they were in a  biker gang.  That's ridiculous.  Fucking faggots.  That's worse than fucking WAP puppets.  Yeah.  Bunch of sharks.  Street sharks.  They were jawsome.  Yeah.  Ew.  Jawsome.  See, that guy with your cartoons, that's just stunk from that generation.  Bugs Bunny, they address social issues.  Oh, Bugs Bunny.  They fucking World War II.  No.  Fucking attacking the Japs and the Crouch.  Yes.  And you guys got fucking racer clit. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, it's a guy going, yum, yum, yum, a robot monster.  What shitty cartoons you guys got?  You did have shitty cartoons.  Terrible.  Biker mice from Mars.  That's terrible.  Garbage.  Giant mice that rode motorcycles.  Horrible.  Horrible animation.  Yeah, and the fucking shark of the sidecar.  Fuck you.  Give me a rabbit, y'all, and we'll kill you, Japs.  Exactly.  Street sharks.  No.  Jawsome.  Can you find it?  Jawsome is so...  Oh, that's so stupid.  Find what?  Marlon Perkins.  Sure, I was looking for Pat Cooper.  Oh, okay.  Wild Kingdom. 
[02:07:30]  Okay, you want Marlon Perkins?  Yeah, Wild Kingdom.  What?  It was Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.  And then...  Oh.  So old.  The yellow...  Why can't I hear it?  I just hear people talking in the back.  I had two things going on.  What's your...  Something with Pat Cooper video?  Starring Marlon Perkins.  He's the director of the St. Louis Zoo.  He was old back then. 
[02:08:00]  Yes, and look at young Jim Fowler.  He was funny on the Tonight Show, Jim Fowler.  Yes.  He was always good.  Chased by Copter.  What?  Oh, that's the title of the episode.  Oh.  And now they're showing a giraffe running at night.  It's like a school movie.  I would hate this show.  I'd be so bored by it.  It was all we had, Sam.  It seems like a science project.  Yes!  Wild Kingdom.  I hate a science project.  It's possible.  Presented by Mutual of Omaha. 
[02:08:30]  The people who pay.  The people who pay?  That sounds threatening.  Is Marlon Perkins in front of the stage right there, or is he outdoors?  I think he's outdoors.  Oh, yeah.  Stan Brock.  Stan Brock.  Wow.  He's all man, that guy.  Yeah.  I would just be trying to figure out why Muppet Babies wasn't on.  Oh, sick.  Exactly.  What's shit?  I remember they'd always guilt you on that show, and then tie in the sponsor also.  They would do that at the same time.  Marlon would come out at the end and be like, like the lion needs protection from poachers, 
[02:09:00]  you need protection too with Mutual of Omaha insurance.  He would.  He would say that.  I didn't understand what Mutual of Omaha was.  I never understood insurance because I was like, if you're dead, why do you care what  happens to your money?  Right.  I never understood insurance.  Well, you were always very selfish.  It's right?  Yeah.  Because I was like, why do you care what happens to anything after you're dead? 
[02:09:30]  Because you're just gone, and there's nothing, so who cares what happens to it?  And now you're like, well, I need insurance to make sure that fucking government doesn't  take it.  Right.  That's the concern now.  Yes.  I was very selfish.  You're very selfish.  No, you're just a boy.  I was a young-  You didn't know any better.  A young, little fucking pussy boy.  You're just a boy.  Who are you supposed to know?  You're just a little puppet boy.  I liked Topo G-Joe.  I liked-  You liked all the puppets.  I liked Ed Sullivan. 
[02:10:00]  Of course you did.  I liked the wonderful world of Disney.  I wish you were making a little fucking- a little puppet show, and then you went in  bed when your mother came in and made your soup.  Fucking poured rat poison in your fucking soup.  No.  Little puppet boy queer.  No.  No.  Misha Barton.  Yeah.  That puppet show sucked.  Yeah, it was horrible.  I remember when the Brady Bunch and Partridge family premiered.  It was a big night.  That was Friday nights.  They premiered at the same time?  Yeah.  You'd watch the Brady Bunch first. 
[02:10:30]  I believe that was 8, and then 8.30 was the Partridge family, I think.  I remember when the Brady Bunch premiered.  Yeah.  On Nick at Night.  No, I'm talking, um, the original run.  Oh.  I don't remember that.  The original run of the Brady Bunch.  Oh.  And Partridge family.  Well, you- you were probably old enough, Jim, but you probably-  No, I was a boy.  Weren't as into television as I was.  I love TV.  I was always- no, I was obsessed with television as a kid, much like you were with, um, with  a girl's urine. 
[02:11:00]  And boy's penises.  At that age, and boy's penises.  I couldn't- I just couldn't fill up my greedy mouth fast enough.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you ever watch Fraggle Rock?  Yes.  No, I was older by the time.  I wasn't into Fraggle Rock.  Down in Fraggle Rock!  I was much older.  Yeah.  How about-  How about love American style?  Truer than the red, white, and blue.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Love--  You watch that one?  I have heard about that show on TV.  It's about the olden days.  Oh, here it is.  Look. 
[02:11:30]  Love, love, love.  What?  Love American style.  Truer than the red, white, and blue.  Woo-hoo!  Love American style.  That's me.  Rick Harris.  I thought he had good eyes.  Ha-ha.  Harold Gould.  I thought he liked morbid things.  Ronnie Howard.  This must be the, um, yeah, this was the actual inspiration for Happy Days.  Marion Ross. 
[02:12:00]  Is it in it?  Wow.  Yeah, this-  Oh, and Anselm Williams.  Okay, wow.  Yeah, Love-  Happy Days started on Love American Style.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Love!  Love!  That's me and you.  What year was this?  I don't know.  Like 71?  E-Rock?  The only way I knew this show existed was because they used to just show the intro as a bumper  during the Happy Days marathon on Nick at Night.  Love and the Happy Days.  Oh.  Written by Gary Marshall.  Gary Marshall.  Yes, it was Love and the Happy Days, and it was, uh, I think the father was different. 
[02:12:30]  It wasn't, um, what's his name?  Tom Bosley.  Tom Bosley.  I want to say 74.  Oh.  Yeah.  Because that's another one that I've only known to exist on reruns.  On Nick at Night.  What, Happy Days?  Yeah.  Oh, that's fucking getting up there.  I would say one of the best theme songs ever.  What?  Happy Days.  Very definable.  Yes.  Like when-  Yeah, yeah.  I was so displaced with when Happy Days started that when I would watch it, I assumed it was 
[02:13:00]  made when it was accurate for the time.  Yeah.  Like, I didn't think it was a throwback to-  Oh, you didn't think it was a period piece?  No.  You thought it was-  Well, actually, it wasn't more than 10 or 12 years past what they were portraying.  Yeah.  Which is very odd when you think about it.  I figured that was just a show about the time.  It would be like doing a show now based on the year 2000.  Yeah.  That's what it was like when Happy Days first came out as, uh, what it was when it came out.  A little more, like 16 years? 
[02:13:30]  A little bit more, right?  13, 14, 15, 16, yeah, maybe 16.  I remember MASH, I mean, uh, Mad Magazine did the parody, and they called it Hammy Days.  They were terrible with their titles.  They were funny, though, Mad Men.  They were a really brilliant parody.  Like, a crockwork lemon.  Yeah.  A crock of shit now for Apocalypse Now where they bleeped out shit.  It was very funny.  A crock of shit now.  I remember a little record album in the back of a Mad Magazine.  Yes.  It was an Archie Bunker one.  Yeah.  It was square.  You peeled it off the page and put it on your record player. 
[02:14:00]  A record player.  Yeah.  It was not even a turntable.  It wasn't a nice turntable.  It was a record player.  There was another song on the back.  It was a big song from Mad Magazine on the back of the, uh...  God, can you look up Mad Magazine songs from the...  Like, there was a...  Oh, fuck.  Remember the mad, uh, the folding thing at the end?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would always fold it so it wouldn't bend my magazine.  Make it out.  Make it out.  Everyone's making out. 
[02:14:30]  Is this it?  But me.  Oh, look.  We get to hear it.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Oh, disco years, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to break out, lose and swing.  You liked this?  I don't...  I'm sure I did, yeah.  Yeah.  Till those bells ring.  Ding-a-ling as loud as can be.  Sam's laughing at you now.  Ding-a-ling.  But I'd never hear them chime.  Cause I chicken out each time. 
[02:15:00]  Uh-huh.  And I know the only ding-a-ling as me.  Is me, yeah.  Oh, you like it.  Oh, that's horrible.  Now...  Make it out.  I tell myself I could be, should be.  Make it out.  This is terrible.  Is this funny, or...  Is that it?  Everyone's making out but me.  Yeah.  I loved this when I was younger. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, because you weren't making out.  No, I wasn't.  Well, you made out with the girl in the tent, but she told her brother to not go away.  Yeah.  Cause some drunk is...  Oh, what's this?  This is horrible.  This is so bad.  It's funny.  No, it's not funny at all.  Would you rather watch Topo G-Joe, Sam?  Then...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Topo G-Joe is pretty bad.  Topo G-Joe is rough.  Horrible.  I loved it as a kid.  You did.  Yeah, because it was just a...  It was a fucking puppet. 
[02:16:00]  You didn't realize they were making fun of you?  Why would they make them fun of me?  Oh, the Italian thing?  Yeah, yeah.  Make it out.  Make it out.  I tell myself I could be, should be.  Make it out.  That's horrible.  This is...  It's not funny.  I'm making out.  Is it...  Oh...  Oh, all I'm making out.  Is that everyone's making it out?  Oh, all I'm making out, like all I'm figuring, from all that's making out, is everyone's making out but me.  It's very chippersome.  Fucking hilarious. 
[02:16:30]  How long is this fucking thing?  Six already.  Six and a half minutes.  Uh-oh, we're all good.  Ralph Nader.  Oh.  This is terrible.  Pop culture.  They're topical.  He's not eating fat.  Make it out.  Yeah.  I've even seen a Muppet that is making out.  Oh, this is so bad. 
[02:17:00]  I'm getting goose chills.  There's still four minutes left.  Yeah, plenty of time.  Plenty of time for laughter.  Yuck-o.  I never...  What's the date on this Mad Magazine?  How much respect would you lose for me who was 1997?  How long?  We have to hear the whole thing.  That I'd like some close encounters.  Dude.  Oh, close encounters.  All right, so it's after 77.  After 70... 
[02:17:30]  Never get it on.  There's no time period where this would be appropriate.  78.  78.  I thought this was a hoot and a half.  I have to show him how.  And this is almost the Rocky Horror sound to it.  I thought it was cool.  Who did this?  You're going to come after this in your next special?  It sounds like America Sings.  Oh, let's make it out.  Come on.  No, I won't come on. 
[02:18:00]  Got it.  You're not making out with anyone.  But me.  How did they think they could make this an epic?  What did they have?  Like six minutes?  Six and a half minutes of vinyl?  Oh.  Oh.  Superman.  King Kong, when he is going ape, is making out.  These references.  I've even heard that Mr. Spock is making out. 
[02:18:30]  Would you believe that my...  You know how many times he listened to this?  He had to listen to it a lot.  To retain all this information 30 years later.  Everyone's making out.  All right with the making out.  Making out's funny.  How often did you listen to this?  Constantly.  Jimmy, this is awful.  Your parents would have to put up with you listening to this in the house.  Because this girl I used to see was very hot to me.  How old were you when you were listening to this? 
[02:19:00]  Ten.  Eleven.  Yeah.  This is a super special issue.  And the cover has all the people that are making out.  Is that Fonzie in the upper right?  I've seen this.  Yeah.  More.  Making out.  Making out.  It's going on in two minutes.  This is so bad. 
[02:19:30]  I'm making out.  I got it.  Imagine being a parent and hearing this coming from your kid's room.  Yeah, hilarious.  After they got their mad magazine.  How embarrassing.  I used to love this song.  Apparently.  But me.  All right.  Can you imagine getting through the six and a half minutes?  And the sound of your kid picking up a needle and moving it right back to the beginning.  Starting it over.  Hey, did you?  See, you're making some funny lines.  Jacques Cousteau.  Would you have listened to this more than one time in a row? 
[02:20:00]  Oh.  The Fonz we know most every night is making out.  And Charlie Brown, but he's a type.  He's making out.  Contraguila with just one face.  You like that part, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Oh, God.  Make it out.  Did you go to school and say, hey, did you hear making out?  You all heard making out.  Yeah.  Oh.  Make it out.  But all.  I'm making out. 
[02:20:30]  It's all.  It's making out.  It's that everyone's making out.  I can't believe it's still going.  But.  Oh, I forgot.  It's the big ending.  Are you, uh, I don't remember who I was at the beginning of this song.  Yeah.  A douche.  Right.  Okay.  Do I hear it again?  No.  Sure.  No.  That's it.  Making out.  I just want you to know that you will be thinking of that for the rest of the day. 
[02:21:00]  I don't want to, though.  But oh.  I don't know what part you'll be thinking of.  I don't want to.  Some of you will be thinking, I tell myself I could be, should be, making out, or.  I'll just be doing, making out.  From all this making out.  Mine will be, making out.  Making out.  Is that everyone's making out?  But me.  But me.  That's, uh.  Yeah, I don't remember that, Jimmy.  I fucking love it.  I played that a lot. 
[02:21:30]  Don't.  $5.99.  Buy it now.  Wait, you can buy the magazine with making out.  You know what?  Everything you think is collectible ink.  It's not.  Uh, well, you played the record.  Uh, there's a little wear on the pages.  I'll give you a 50 cents for it.  The song is dog shit.  Yeah, the song sucks.  Well, Chumlee liked singing Make It Out.  Count Dracula with just one bite is making out.  Stop it. 
[02:22:00]  I hate the making out song.  It's so bad.  That's because everyone was making out but you.  That's how I felt.  Oh, God.  Travis liked it.  Oh, yeah.  By that point, I had gotten rid of Mad Magazine altogether and went to National Lampoon.  National Lampoon was a very funny.  Very funny magazine.  They do everything.  Comical songs like Make It Out?  No, it was funny writing from a lot of great writers of the day and this day.  Yes. 
[02:22:30]  I can't even really make fun of you for having all this stuff that I have no point of reference  to.  Yes.  Now, when the interns come in, we don't have any shared experiences anymore.  They have newer shit than you.  You're the old guy.  Yep.  All the stuff that I watch.  Like Muppet Babies?  I don't understand what you're talking about.  Fraggle Rock?  Nope.  Fraggle Rock.  You can't do that on television?  I bet they don't make it out, though.  No, why would they?  Nobody here knew it.  It's an internet sensation.  No, it's not.  It is.  How many hits did that YouTube video have? 
[02:23:00]  7,000 in five years?  Mongo writes, this song is so annoying, I want to make out with a shotgun.  I actually watched an episode of Fraggle Rock very recently, within the past couple of  weeks.  It was on, and I was asleep, and I woke up, and it was on.  And I just didn't want to change the channel.  I didn't want to find the remote.  And I'm just watching, and I just didn't really get it.  I don't think I've watched an episode since 1989. 
[02:23:30]  First of all, what are they?  They're living in a wall.  Yeah.  And who is that guy with the dog that's way too overdramatic?  The stupid dog.  I don't know.  I didn't get it.  My sister watched this.  My older sister, yeah.  Was this HBO?  Yes.  Eric, do you have the DVDs?  Of course.  It was Jim Henson.  Ew, you like this shit?  Jim Henson and his flume up.  Yeah, I grew up on it, Jim.  96 episodes.  Childish.  You still watch it, though?  B-Rock.  I haven't watched it in a long time, but I haven't. 
[02:24:00]  You're too old to even have thought this was good.  How old were you?  Seven, eight.  Eric just wants to be a boy forever.  Forever and ever.  He wants to just be a boy.  B-Rock.  The boy who never grew up.  Exactly.  He just grew out.  Peter Pan Complex.  Peter Fryin' Pan.  Peter Sucker.  Peter Pan Cake.  Peter Pan Peanut Butter.  Have we done this? 
[02:24:30]  No.  Oh.  I'm just adding.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Fucking yeah.  Peter something, right?  Peter Puffer?  Yeah, Peter Sucker.  Oh, Jesus.  Cocksucker.  I don't know what you're talking about.  It just always takes a bad turn.  You weren't going, man.  It just gets violent.  Yeah.  Why don't you put your fucking eggs in the pan or something and get a heart attack?  Holy Jesus.  Fucking hunk of garbage.  Wow.  You shut the fuck up. 
[02:25:00]  Oh.  Why would he say that?  Shit.  What was the song somebody just tweeted me to?  The other song, They're Coming to Take Me Away.  Oh, that was funny.  That was funny, too.  What was it, Eric?  It was like Napoleon the 18th, I think, was the artist.  But he rock knows all the goof songs.  It was a Dr. Demento staple.  You were a big Dr. Demento fan, right?  Yeah.  Let's hear that one.  That was really funny.  You were a Dr. Kevorkian fan.  Exactly.  You think Eric would have listened to him making out?  Dr. Kevorkian. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, you have it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That wasn't that funny.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Well, you left me anyhow.  This is terrible.  So funny.  What year is this?  Would you turn this up on Dr. Demento?  Like, oh, it's...  They're coming to take me away.  Ha, ha.  They're coming to take me away.  Ho, ho.  Hee, hee.  Ha, ha.  To the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time. 
[02:26:00]  I used to like this.  I'd be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats.  And they're coming to take me away.  Ha, ha.  He's crazy.  66?  This is funny.  So you laughed.  You laughed when I had said that losing you would make me flip my lip.  Right?  You know you laughed.  I heard you laughed.  So she...  This was made in 66?  How long is Dr. Demento playing it for?  Really?  He's still on.  Do you like this?  So, no. 
[02:26:30]  A girl left him and he lost his mind?  Is that what this song's about?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  He's singing this into her sliced-out vagina.  Exactly.  He's using it as a fucking Senior Wences fucking puppet.  Put his pubes on the head.  It just keeps saying I have bad breath over and over.  Old clit nose.  For all my kind unscathed, loving peace.  Alright.  I'm so glad people don't do bullshit like this anymore.  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[02:27:00]  Like...  People don't really make funny songs like this anymore.  No?  No.  About Weird Al.  Exactly.  Weird Al has a...  They're coming to take me away.  Ha ha, hee hee ho.  Now that would get, like, flack.  Because it's like, well, people have mental illness.  And it shouldn't be looked at as a funny song.  You know, when they come to take you away, it's not funny.  That still shouldn't be looked at as a funny song, but that's not why.  No, you're right.  I don't know why.  Like, it was just something... 
[02:27:30]  Anything...  Anything different.  People were like, oh, this is great.  I just think it's funny that you told him you wish he was a fan of Dr. Kevorkian.  Ha ha ha.  Because it's just...  A, it's another doctor.  Then we get it.  And B, that means that he would have committed suicide.  Yes!  Assisted suicide.  That's what Dr. Kevorkian did, right?  He helped people kill themselves?  Yes.  I wish you were a fan of his.  Because if you're a fan, you're going to kill yourself.  Yeah, you're sick and you're going to get fucking relief from cancer. 
[02:28:00]  I wanted Eric to have himself killed.  Oh, my goodness.  Eric, did you pick up on that?  Yes, several times.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  No.  Uh, God, we're all over the place with a little bit of history here.  Our entertainment history that we all lived through.  All of us, right?  No, not even close.  What?  Yeah, no, absolutely not.  You don't remember that?  No.  My dad would watch shows like Manics and Canon and stuff. 
[02:28:30]  And I would, you know, be forced to watch that because only one TV in the house.  And there wasn't cable or anything.  So, you know, you watched what was on Channel 2, Channel 4, Channel 5.  Channel 7.  Channel 8 was Connecticut's Channel 7.  So, it was pretty much the same thing.  Channel 9.  Channel 11.  And then Channel 13.  That's all you had.  All you had.  So, your 2, 4, and 7 were your big ones.  And at night, that's what you watched. 
[02:29:00]  So, Manics and the Mod Squad, Room 222, Canon.  Canon!  Canon!  A Quinn Martin production!  They would always yell,  Well, today's guest stars!  I was like,  Tonight's episode!  Killer Vengeance!  How old were you when you were watching these adult shows?  23.  No!  No!  It was still air conditioning.  I was 7, 8, around there. 
[02:29:30]  But I do recall them very vividly.  Yeah.  I watched them all.  I wasn't allowed to watch adult shows.  You know?  Why not?  I remember the first time I was allowed to stay up to watch something that wasn't, like,  my, you know, level was Perfect Strangers.  That was a great show.  I wonder why your mom liked that one.  What is she going to make her family?  Perfect Strangers.  Mom, why are you watching Hung Rabbi? 
[02:30:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, shit.  Hung Rabbi.  Yes.  Ah.  It was a great show.  What's this?  Yeah.  Perfect Strangers.  Perfect Strangers song.  Don't be ridiculous.  Do you know...  Oh.  Yeah, Eric just wants to blast this.  Oh, God, I know.  You like this, Eric?  I love that show.  Everyone our age loves this.  Yeah, it's a good fucking show.  It wasn't a good show.  Yeah, it was.  Feltie from me.  It was silly.  Did you like the one with Winnie? 
[02:30:30]  And what was that one?  The Wonder Years.  The Wonder Years.  The Wonder Years.  Yeah.  I watched that to this.  Who was the guy that died on it or something and that Winnie was sad?  Oh, the brother.  It was Winnie's brother.  Yeah.  The brother died in Vietnam.  The Nam.  It was the first episode?  The Nam.  That holds up.  Absolutely.  That's a great show.  So does Boy Meets World.  Ew.  I watch that shit on MTV, too, literally, when I get home from work.  Boy Meets World?  What is that shit on that one?  That's the Ben Savage show.  That's the other savage kid. 
[02:31:00]  Like, to the point where, two days ago, I was watching it.  Oh, boy.  See?  That, I...  No, Cory and Topanga.  Topanga.  Well, Topanga.  The one that was fucking porno imposter all over the fucking internet for a while.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, it wasn't really her, but it kind of looked like her, and she was naked.  You know what's Perfect Strangers?  No.  She thought she was a lot hotter than she was.  That Topanga.  Fuck her.  You wide-nosed bitch.  She has pretty lips, though.  Nah. 
[02:31:30]  Fucking suck them tits.  She got giant titties.  Fuck yeah.  Big mother tits.  Yeah.  Mother tits.  Not a big fan of Topanga.  What year was the Wonder Years on?  Was it the same time as the other one?  No, the Wonder Years was probably like 88 to 90, or 87 to 91.  98 to 93.  And when was the fucking Boy Meets World?  That was later.  That was like 95 to...  Oh.  And what about Mr. Belvedere?  93 to 2000.  What was Mr. Belvedere?  Did you watch Mr. Belvedere?  No, I didn't. 
[02:32:00]  Now that's a theme song you should be playing.  That was great.  No.  That was 85 to 90.  What shit?  I didn't watch any of these shows.  Fresh Prince, Mr. Belvedere.  With Bob Euchre.  This is almost as bad as the Ropers.  This is...  This is a great song. 
[02:32:30]  No, it's not.  There's a change in the status quo.  Gonna need all the help that you can get.  What was he?  He's a butler.  He was a rapist.  Did he get in an accident with a guy and didn't have insurance, so he had to be his butler?  Because he's my butler.  This is terrible.  It's a great show.  It's not a great show.  I have to agree with E-Rock on this one. 
[02:33:00]  Eileen Graff, where is she?  Mr. Belvedere.  Rob Stone.  What happened to Rob Stone?  Exactly.  All these 80s haircuts.  And then they have the daughter, Tracy Wells.  Tracy Wells is gone.  The little bratty kid.  Oh, yuck.  Bryce Buckman.  Whatever his name is.  Bob Euchre I like.  My wife and I were watching Who's the Boss the other night.  Yeah.  That's a show that does not hold up.  No?  No.  Why?  Samantha.  It's just not funny.  Hey, my daughter's got great tits, huh?  Mr. Belvedere was the butler?  Yeah, that's a great show. 
[02:33:30]  That was a great...  Is this his?  Oh.  I like Mr. Belvedere.  Small Wonder.  Yeah.  It gets a little awkward when I pick my daughter up now.  She's got giant tits and a great ass.  You watch Small Wonder?  It's a small wonder.  There you go.  This show ever got on the air.  Wait, what's this?  Oh.  She's the small wonder.  Remember this? 
[02:34:00]  She was the robot kid?  We should really be watching.  She was a robot.  What's she ever fucking moment of the show?  I want to watch that kid.  Small Wonder.  I loved it.  How did they not know it was a robot or how did she not get picked up by child services for  being, obviously, having a problem?  She'll enchant you at first sight.  Dick Christie as the father.  Yeah, she was a little robot that couldn't tell nobody.  She was just a programmer to forget.  Is that what you would do on the ball?  Yeah, I used to play with my pud watching that show.  Wipe out the memory bank? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, I need a little girl robot and a boy wanting to kiss.  Oh, and there she is.  Oh, wow.  What great special effects.  Look at the circuitry in her back.  That's fucking fake.  Tiffany Brissette.  That's fucking fake.  And she talked like a robot all the time.  Yeah, that's fucking fake.  Oh, and that ugly fucking redheaded...  Emily Shulman was a good girl.  No, she wasn't.  Whatever happened to the small wonder girl?  Did she pose in fucking Maxim or something? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, she kept trying to parlay it into robot stories that nobody cared about.  Robot sex stories.  She was actually a robot.  Whoa.  She looks like fucking Janis Joplin now.  Yeah, what the fuck?  All growed up.  Let's see.  Tiffany Brissette.  Vicky of Small Wonder.  Let's see what she looks like now.  Where the fuck is she?  I don't know.  Is that her?  Oh, you gotta blow that shit up.  I can't see it.  Oh, okay. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Whoa.  Wow, wait.  Wow.  What happened to her?  That's a small wonder.  She looks like fucking...  She looks like Ozzy after the original Black Sabbath record came out.  Well, she wasn't really a cute kid either.  No.  Quite frankly.  It's like Punky Brewster gone wrong.  Punky Brewster wound up looking kind of cute, though.  Yeah, I think so.  And she got them giant tits and had to get them cut off.  Right.  Like she needed to get a breast augmentation surgery because she had giant tits.  Did you watch that shit?  Soleil Moon Fry. 
[02:36:00]  Did you watch Punky Brewster?  No, that was still...  I was too old for that shit.  A little?  You were way too old for it.  Do you remember the Small Wonder theme song?  Is that her laying on that bed?  This one?  Yeah.  No way.  Yeah.  Wow.  Holy Punky Brewster.  She looks great.  I'd fuck her face.  Fuck yeah.  Here's another good song.  A little tattoo.  Yeah.  What is she doing now?  What was her...  What was Punky Brewster's deal?  She was adopted?  No, her mom left her at the mall and then she was lost.  What?  And then she knocked on Henry's door. 
[02:36:30]  What?  And what did he fuck her mouth?  And then Henry let her live with him and the dog.  Why didn't she just find her mom?  Because her mom abandoned her.  Her mom abandoned her at the mall.  Aw, Punky!  And then she put me at the foundling center.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Made me be afraid to...  Zilchie Brewster.  Ah, shit.  The old guy on Punky Brewster was from Police Academy.  Right.  Oh, Ron Liebman? 
[02:37:00]  The captain or the commander or something.  Ron Liebman.  Eric Lassard.  No.  Yeah, yeah.  Every time I turn around.  You know all these fucking theme songs, huh?  My sister would watch these.  I didn't watch any of them.  I watched Family Ties in the 80s.  That was a great show.  That was about it.  That was a great show.  That was about it, though.  I mean, everything else is a little too fucking juvenile.  Alex P. Keaton was my shit.  Yeah.  Alex Keaton was...  You could really kind of tell he was going places back then.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  He ended up being like the lead character in the show. 
[02:37:30]  Some episodes where he wasn't in it.  You know, he was filming something else.  Yes.  And you knew Cheney Yothers wasn't going to do much.  No.  This is the instrumental.  It said Family Ties theme.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He's hit every other fucking theme song we get on this one.  Oh.  What will we do, baby?  It's a great song.  What will we do?  Painting a picture of all of them.  Yes.  I bet we've been together for a minute. 
[02:38:00]  Tiener Yothers.  It's a long time.  You knew not to put the fucking shot clock on her.  No.  The 18-year-old clock didn't apply.  You know.  Although the older sister, what was her name?  Justine Bateman.  Justine Bateman was...  She was hot there.  Right.  She was pretty hot.  She was cute.  Like you wanted her as your girlfriend cute.  Remember?  They thought she was going to be the big star because she did that one movie about a girl  band.  Yes.  That tanked.  And then Michael J. Fox just wound up.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Everybody.  So did Justin Bateman.  Yes.  Jason. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Jason.  Jason Bateman.  Meredith Baxter-Burney.  I remember she was in one of those shows in Lifetime where she got the breast cancer.  The father was very funny.  Michael Gross was really funny.  Michael Gross.  Yeah.  Worked at the public television station.  I never liked that part.  Did it?  Fa-la-la-la.  I hate any fa-na-na-na, sha-na-na-na, wa-na-na-na.  I like the end version because it's playing over the credits and then right at the end of  the theme song it goes, sit, ubu, sit, good dog.  That would do that at the end of Hatchy, too.  Yeah.  There's a lot of shows.  Yeah.  That was the 80s. 
[02:39:00]  It was either him or that fucking one where he took the paper out of the fucking typewriter.  But he was more like those action shows.  He did the action shows.  Like Hill Street Blues.  Yeah.  I wasn't watching any of that.  How funny was it?  Did you ever watch Taxi?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a funny show.  That's a great show.  That might be the funniest ever.  It's one of the funniest ever.  Yeah, that's a really good show.  That still holds up, too.  Definitely.  Taxi.  Yeah, it's just a bunch of miserable fucking... 
[02:39:30]  Because Louie was such a cunt.  You didn't watch things like a Zoom?  No, I don't know what that is.  I remember Zoom.  We're going to Zoom, Zoom, Zoom, a Zoom.  We're going to Zoom, a Zoom, a Zoom, a Zoom.  I know Zoom, Zoom.  We're going to teach you to fly high.  Just shake your rum.  Zoom, Zoom, Zoom, a Zoom.  No?  Zoom, Zoom.  We're going to Zoom.  We're going to Zoom.  Zoom, Zoom, Zoom, Zoom.  And then they used to tell you to write them letters.  And they go, write Zoom.  Z-O-O-M, Box 350, Boston, Mass.  O-2-1-3-4. 
[02:40:00]  Maybe I was living in England.  I don't know anything about this Zoom.  England?  Yeah.  What are you?  I lived in England when I was a kid for a while.  Maybe Oxford University?  No.  Eight years old.  Oh.  They wouldn't have let me in.  I think Zoom for you was what Steam Pipe Alley was for us.  I watched that.  Is that Mario Cantone?  Yeah.  That's fruit.  He was on Steam Pipe Alley.  Up fucking Butt Pipe Alley.  He's done right in Secaucus in the warehouse.  Secaucus.  Yeah.  He kind of made that show funny. 
[02:40:30]  I didn't mind that.  Steam Pipe Alley was on, yeah, WOR Channel 9.  How long was it on for?  A few years.  It was only a couple of years, yeah.  I don't remember this shit at all.  I don't know.  We're getting on to one side.  What year was it?  88.  And he would do voices and characters that the kids didn't even get.  He'd be doing, like, Joan Crawford impressions to fucking, like, five-year-olds. 
[02:41:00]  It's very Monty Python.  Yes.  Throwing a hat.  Is this a rip-off of You Can't Do That on Television?  Ah, a little of that.  A little Wonderama.  Romper Room.  Romper Room.  And he would be so over the top, the kids would love him, because he was just so flamboyant.  The prizes were awful.  Terrible.  Before you break my path, you get a little over.  Yeah, when you're a little kid, all this gay shit is hilarious. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Gay is fucking hilarious to kids.  Kids love gay.  They think it's funny.  I love it.  Prizes, prizes, and excuses, excuses for you.  What the fuck is he doing?  Because the cartoons are ten on the richest scale.  Ten.  We also have our mystery guests.  Well, the kids are just sitting there not knowing what's going on.  No, they're like, they're health captains.  They make no sense.  Yeah.  Right, Chipper.  My mother didn't like him.  She said he's sinning against the Lord, Chipper.  Well, some religious people would think that. 
[02:42:00]  What is that?  He just passed gas.  Yeah, exactly.  Why is there a condom and semen on the floor behind me?  Hey, there's an unblown-up balloon on the floor.  Hey, it's got some delicious vanilla stuff in it.  That's trying to say.  All right, enough of him.  All right.  I'll tell you what energy he must have had to keep that going.  That's a fucking hardship.  That would be stammering. 
[02:42:30]  In my day, it was Wonderama.  Do you think the Steam Pipe Alley bit, Nerdfellas, is funny?  Well, let's see it.  He would do bits.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sam.  All right.  Come on!  All my life, I wanted to be a gangster.  I thought it was better to be a president of the United States of America.  He's punching a toy.  The kids don't even know what he's parodying.  No. 
[02:43:00]  The kids aren't watching Goodfellas.  In prison.  Especially when it just came out.  Yeah.  You must be a really big fan of Jaws.  Hey, this is Billy Swayze.  Yeah, this is Tommy DeShop.  Hey, listen.  All right.  I can't.  No.  I can't.  No.  I'm punching out.  I'm punching out of this.  No, no.  Get it off.  I've had it.  I've had it.  Bob, yeah. 
[02:43:30]  No.  I bet that's supposed to be Goodfellas.  It's still not as bad as making out.  Making out was good.  Yeah, making out.  Making out.  Making out.  Do you remember Wonderama with Bob McAllister?  Bob McAllister, walk-a-doo.  Yeah.  He would sing songs.  He would sing songs.  All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth.  I don't know that song.  And Good News Today and the exercise song.  Exercise.  Exercise.  Come on, everybody.  Do your exercise.  Can we hear that? 
[02:44:00]  I don't remember that.  I do remember that.  And a bunch of little kids.  We're going to have all kinds of nutty things.  He had great hair.  But right now, let's everybody do a little exercise.  Fucking helmet hair.  Exercise.  Exercise.  Oh, God.  Imagine the shit and piss it's not like in there.  Just a bunch of kids.  They have them hopped up on candy.  Exercise.  This show is on for three.  Those kids are too old to be shitty and pissing themselves.  This show is on for three hours on Sunday. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  And you'd watch the whole thing?  Yes.  I'd watch the whole thing.  72.  I remember this.  They'd have games and shit.  Would you jump up and down and exercise with them?  No.  Oh, and they'd freeze.  And everybody would get a little chance to be on camera.  Exercise.  Come on, everybody.  You like this?  Fuck yeah.  That was Chip and Jim.  Yeah, wow. 
[02:45:00]  Come on, everybody.  Do your exercise.  Oh, God.  Well, there he goes.  Yeah, they'd all jump up and down.  He's dead now, Bob McAllister.  That's good.  Exercise.  Why would you say that's good?  Exercise.  From my childhood.  Roger Daltrey was on Wonderama.  He used to get, like, fucking the Rolling Stones and shit.  I don't understand why, but he did.  There's Roger Daltrey.  Where am I?  Down there.  Oh, he's probably singing,  You guys are not from my generation.  Oh, God.  Right now, the lead singer of The Who and the star of Tommy, Roger Daltrey. 
[02:45:30]  This is 1975.  Tommy.  Oh, no.  He's going to sing?  The kids didn't care.  Welcome to Wonderama.  How odd is it?  Why is he sitting there in front of fucking five-year-olds?  Because the parents are watching, too.  How come the idea of half man, half horse?  Oh, that album cover.  A mythological creature called a centaur.  A centaur.  If you look up, what the centaur means.  Kids are like, what? 
[02:46:00]  It's kind of like rock and roll.  I don't know this.  I just made wet.  Kids don't care.  Mommy, I made wet in my pants.  Who is this scary man with the curly hair?  Many people say that rock was supposed to be the voice of people.  That were against the establishment.  This was an adult interview in front of kids.  Yeah.  That's why kids now are fucking dunces.  Because you didn't have this.  No.  You had a fucking magical muppet.  Hey, look.  The fucking turd puppet.  Down in Fraggle Rock.  Down in Fraggle Rock.  This is why we are smarter than you. 
[02:46:30]  I think you're right.  This is who we had.  Because we had Roger Daltrey on Wonderama.  It was a mix of adult and childish discussion.  Look at Roger D. He was badass back then.  Rockstar.  Explain to him why he made himself a centaur.  But it was still an adult conversation.  It was not like, you know,  You found it, Fraggle Rock.  Yeah.  You'd exercise a little.  Do your exercise.  Exercise.  Exercise.  And then there was,  Have you heard any good news today?  Today, I want to hear what you have to say. 
[02:47:00]  And then he goes,  Do you have good news?  And the kid goes,  My tooth fell out.  I was like,  Oh, any good news?  Yeah, I got my period.  Good news.  What?  Oh.  I like weird news better.  And I think Paul Lind is in the audience here.  Yeah, there he is.  I'm not kidding.  Yeah, he is.  It's Paul Lind.  And the camera catches him.  What are you doing, you queen?  One, two, three.  I guess I don't know who it's called. 
[02:47:30]  I'm glad it's over.  It's great, yeah.  What?  I'm glad I won the drama.  Oh, that was always the cop-out one.  I'm on Wonderama.  I'm going to go ice skating.  I'm going to go ice skating.  This is good news?  Exactly.  Look at Bob's outfit.  Any good news today, today?  I want to hear what you have to say.  Wait till I get to the count of three. 
[02:48:00]  And tell me all the good news you have for me.  One, two, three.  Daddy, stop fucking me.  Yeah.  I would have jumped up and said, I got good news.  My fucking peck is huge.  What do you say we welcome right now?  My asshole healed.  I remember that shit. 
[02:48:30]  I have to piss badly.  All right, we'll take a break and we'll be back.  I guess Vinny, formerly of Jersey Shore, and now from, what is it called?  Vinny's talk show?  The show?  The show with Vinny.  The show with Vinny.  And I guess Uncle Nino and his mom are coming in.  You just missed him dancing in the hallway, spinning his cane around.  Oh, Nino?  Nino.  I think they just went into Al Q, but he's just doing his dance, spinning it around like he's a pimp in the 70s.  Dude, let me be honest. 
[02:49:00]  He's so fucking annoying.  Nino is so annoying.  He won't tell any jokes today.  Oh, please.  Hey, let me tell you something.  Hey.  Let him go with the flow.  He'll come in.  He'll see what direction we're going in.  He'll kind of just float in there.  You know what direction I'm going in?  The elevator.  Oh.  Your dump button works over there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because he tells a lot of racist jokes.  Hey, let him.  Yeah.  Not my fucking problem.  Not my problem.  All right.  And we'll be back after.  Everyone's making out. 
[02:49:30]  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  The kids are running wild because school's out, but cool's in.  No reason to get antsy.  Yeah.  Where are you getting them in your pouncy?  It's Valley Gym.  Oh, my God.  California is trendsetting again with all the coolest slang and wackiest situations.  That is so grody. 
[02:50:00]  Hey, Jim.  Did you, like, hear that Sheila was totes making out with Brad?  Oh, make me want to barf.  Tag along as the crew lives, laughs, but also learns.  Uh, like, oh, my God.  Have you heard what's going on in Uganda?  Joseph Coney is full of baloney.  Jim is the queen of the valley.  And in the valley, we don't take guff.  Well, maybe you can't hear this.  Oops.  Turn it up.  Middle finger time. 
[02:50:30]  Like, that's my grandmother.  Oh, my God.  You're so old.  You should call dirt by name or something.  And a special appearance by President Ronald Reagan.  Yes.  Hello.  Well, whatever.  You're, uh, grody.  Yes.  Gag me with a spoon, mommy.  It's Valley Gym.  Coming very soon to a theater near you.  Well, how am I supposed to talk?  Like, with my butt or something? 
[02:51:00]  The OBS show continues.  I guess Kenneth Paltrow is quite beautiful. 
[02:51:30]  More beautiful than anybody is, uh, saying or, or thinking, um, because...  She once told a friend that instead of arguing with her husband, she should give him oral sex.  The, uh, yeah, yeah, I do.  But this is...  The other thing about this is...  I guess this is Chelsea Handler?  Or...  Yeah.  Yeah?  What a rat she is.  She's not keeping her yap shut.  I guess they told this... 
[02:52:00]  Did they tell it on the show?  Yeah.  Oh, she told it on the show?  Yeah.  With Gwyneth Paltrow there?  Yeah.  Okay, then it's not a rat.  I thought she heard this at, like, a dinner and then ratted her out.  A Gwyneth Paltrow blowjob would seem pretty lackluster.  Let's be honest for a second, because I know you.  Is this...  Is this...  This is a little embarrassing.  It's...  Yes.  It's very embarrassing.  Because people think that you're perfect.  I think that you're perfect.  And then I met you and I realized, no, you're not. 
[02:52:30]  Whoa.  And it is annoying because you look at her life and you think, oh, God, you have this perfect  life and I was like, you have this great family and these beautiful children and this husband  and I kind of had a crush on both of you and I was like, I really don't even want to hang  out with you guys because it makes me feel bad about myself.  And then we were at this dinner party one night and somebody was asked, a girl was asking  advice and she's an amazing advice giver.  And one of our friends was like, you know, I got in a big fight with my husband and I  went home and I just wanted to scream and yell.  And you were like, whatever you're doing, do the opposite. 
[02:53:00]  If you feel angry, go at him with love and you give him a...  A blowjob.  Well.  A blowy, like the kids say.  A blowy.  Yeah, a blowy.  A blowy.  That happens.  What if my mother sees this show?  I'm already sending a copy of the show to your mother.  People need to know that you're like that because you are.  That's an amazing...  I mean, I was like, give a... 
[02:53:30]  I'm not doing that.  All those wacky girls at the dinner table.  Meanwhile, you get into an argument.  She's not blowing you.  She's yelling at you.  She's just going to fucking yell at you.  I love this thing.  They're at dinner one night and she's a great advice giver and she's asked like,  what do you do?  I'm arguing with my husband.  She goes, just give him a blowjob.  Do the opposite.  I'm sure when Gwyneth Paltrow's in the house and the husband and her are screaming at each  other, she's just like, I'm going to drop to my knees and just suck his dick.  You think she just blows the guy from Coldplay all the time? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  She gets all pissed like, that song sucks.  That's what's going on.  Let me give you a blowjob.  She's lying.  She's lying.  She's married to Chris Martin.  Maybe she's not lying.  Yeah.  Because a guy like that, she knows, can replace her.  So maybe she's being bitchy and he's like, I don't care who you are.  I don't get my fucking British prick sucked.  She hangs out with Jay-Z.  Do you think Jay-Z's ever said something mean to her and then she started blowing him?  I hope so.  There's nothing you want to do.  You don't want to fucking have any kind of physical contact with a girl that you're 
[02:54:30]  having an argument with.  You got to get that shit out of the way.  Yeah.  You don't want to be in a vulnerable position.  I've had to stop arguments by just saying I'm sorry and yeah, it was my fault and shit.  Knowing damn fuck well I wasn't wrong, but I've had to do that.  And then you're all made up and everything and everything's fine again, but I just have  this don't even fucking come near me like feeling.  I still have the resentment that I had to fucking, you know, make like I apologize for  no reason. 
[02:55:00]  Right.  You shouldn't have apologized.  That's little Anthony coming out and just trying to get mom and dad to stop fighting.  You're damn right it was.  That was a while back.  I don't think I've done that in a while.  Good.  But I used to do that all the time.  Like, oh, let's just end this fucking shit that's going on.  And if I just was like, yeah, you know, you're right.  I'm sorry.  All right.  That one.  Drives you crazy though, doesn't it?  Now I'm just like, go fuck yourself.  Because, yeah, apologizing just to end the argument is going to drive you nuts in the  long run.  It did.  It did. 
[02:55:30]  It really did.  Oh, the fucking.  Coming up at 10 o'clock.  Sorry.  I have my advice show.  All right.  It's called the new name of it is Advice with Jimmy.  What was the old name?  That should have been one of the original ideas.  Yeah.  There was no name for it.  Oh.  No?  That was just advice.  Are we getting a theme song together?  Advice with Jimmy.  Is it to the Mr. Balfe Deer theme?  No, it might be making out.  Have you been thinking of that song?  I was going to say, Advice with Jim. 
[02:56:00]  Oh.  Advice with Jim.  Yeah.  Could he should be having some advice with Jim?  Advice with Jim.  That's not good.  Dracula with just one bite has Advice with Jim.  I need some advice with Jim.  You're very good on that advice show.  I listen on the way home and you're very non-judgmental, which is good.  And people call in with some fucking, some real problems.  I thought it would be like, Yeah, Jim, my fucking chick won't suck my dick. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  But it's like, wow, these guys got some heavy duty problems.  And it's quite a little responsibility you got yourself there.  But it's very well thought out.  Like, like you're, uh, you're very good.  Well, Ant, I like to consider myself a lifesaver.  Yeah?  Yeah, that's what I'm here for.  Hmm.  Put your life in my hands.  Yes.  I listen to it.  It's all a crapshoot.  It's just a crapshoot.  Helps half of them.  The other half are fucking get their lips wrapped around a fucking exhaust pipe. 
[02:57:00]  Fucking toweling up the windows.  That's, uh, coming up at, uh, 10.  From 10 to 11.  A.  Yeah.  Um, Roland's outside.  Yesterday, you might have heard on the, uh, Sam Roberts, uh, after show that, uh, Roland  wanted us to accept, he was pitching me a guest before I left this very studio.  And it was, uh, and I'm sure he's great.  The guy from Models.  But, uh, oh, I got to cut this story short.  Oh, you're lucky, Roland.  Hi, everybody.  Hi, there he is. 
[02:57:30]  It's Nino and Vinny.  Vinny's mom.  How you been, man?  Are you good?  Oh, my meeky.  That's Jim Norton.  Hey, look.  He's saying hi to you.  What's up, man?  Hey.  I see you guys on TV.  Look at you.  I know, right?  Vinny, take a seat right over there.  Sit right up.  Pull up a mic.  We'll talk about the show.  The show called The Show with Vinny.  Hi.  Vinny's mom. 
[02:58:00]  Look at you.  She's adorable sitting there.  I love it.  Nino, you look great.  You lost some weight, didn't you?  Yeah, I did a little bit.  Look at you, going fucking Hollywood.  Now he's going Hollywood on us.  That's right.  Very nice.  How much weight did you lose?  About 20 pounds.  On purpose?  20 pounds.  He's tan.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at this guy.  His wife is like a little vegan and shit.  Oh, yeah?  You're a vegan?  Not going flea.  In flea, you mean you're a curry.  You look like Gotti.  Fucking looking good.  Looks like a stop sign. 
[02:58:30]  He's got some color to him.  That's nice.  Being vegan, you can get fat though.  No tan is so on.  This is from California.  Oh, yeah?  California tan.  A natural suntan.  You don't eat all carbs though when a lot of vegans.  Patrice quit at one point and he got fatter because he was just eating all carbs and bread.  Every vegan and a person I see like that are like mad chubs.  Yeah, yeah.  At least chubby.  You have an excuse not to eat bad shit.  Bread and pasta, which is hard for me to do.  Why'd you do it?  I just wanted to feel healthier.  Yeah.  How's it working out for you? 
[02:59:00]  All right?  You had a stroke too, right?  Yeah.  That was 10 years ago.  You had a stroke?  That was 10 years.  How bad was it?  Bad.  Very bad.  So did you feel it when it was happening or did you just wake up and they told you?  No, I felt it coming out.  What did it feel like?  Numbness and weakness, kind of dizziness.  So what do you feel every day, right?  Numb, weak, and dizzy.  You were in the car, right?  I was in the car driving.  Oh, jeez.  I bounced off a few cars. 
[02:59:30]  Marron.  So how did you get help?  Did you pull over and tell someone what was happening?  No, it was right by my house.  So I pulled over in the driver and...  You told the hookers.  There you go.  Sorry, I'm amazing.  Now, the show, of course.  That's history.  That's history.  No, that's curious.  Of course it's history.  Because you lived through it and you're obviously fine.  Yeah.  I was in pretty bad shape.  Yeah.  How long were you out for?  I was in a real shape for a couple of months.  Damn.  He's still walking his way with the Ken's the cane.  Oh, that's the cane.  My old right side was all stuck. 
[03:00:00]  Well, your whole left.  My whole left.  Tell him.  But you recovered everything.  You know, my whole left side.  A friend of mine was in a car accident.  My whole left side.  Now he's all right.  He's all right.  I remember that one.  I came a long way.  If we just pull your mic out a little bit so we can hear better.  Now, whose brother are you, by the way?  Okay, so you guys are brother and sister.  That's not a fault.  It's not a fault.  All right. 
[03:00:30]  Was he always like off the wall growing up and everything?  Always.  Yeah.  Middle child syndrome.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Middle child syndrome.  Middle child syndrome.  Potty train syndrome.  Uh-huh.  Rough time with that.  Everything syndrome.  So wait, middle child.  Because he obviously wasn't the youngest or the oldest.  So he was always being louder for attention and to get people.  She's in the middle of the, there's six of us.  She's in the middle of the girls.  I'm in the middle of the boys.  They didn't ask you that. 
[03:01:00]  They asked who we, what?  Yeah.  We didn't ask that.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Thanks, buddy.  Pay attention to your sister.  He's got so Hollywood, man.  He really has.  Look, coffee's coming in now.  He's totally different than he was when he first came in here.  I was on the red carpet.  Imagine a red carpet.  Yeah.  And I'm going to be on that flying carpet, yeah?  So how did they convince you to do a TV show?  Did you want to be in the spotlight or no?  I love you, Sammy.  I really didn't see anything coming.  You know, I mean, Vinny had asked me, you know, told me about the idea. 
[03:01:30]  And I said, fine.  Yeah.  You know, whatever you need me to do.  I mean, I'm always cooking, and we always have family over, and so I just figure, what's  a couple of more 35 people, you know?  What couple of more 35?  She doesn't know what's going on.  She knows she cares about what people want to eat.  She doesn't know who any of the celebrities are that come over.  Now, you know?  Neither does he.  I don't know who they are.  Now I know who they are.  You think he knows?  No, you don't know. 
[03:02:00]  Who do you have that?  No, I know Mark Wahlberg from the movie Ted, you know?  Just from Ted.  From Ted, that's it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, look who I have.  Well, yeah, you have Mark.  You have Kesha.  Kesha.  Kesha's a fucking nut.  Yeah.  Off the wall.  Off the wall.  Are you supposed to be cursing?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You could curse on this one.  Does your mom, do you mind the cursing?  Right.  Do you mind the fucking show?  No.  I don't mind it.  No.  Yeah, I mind it.  No, you don't mind it.  The other day, the New York Post wrote a bad review, and they started making fun of her. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, shit.  And then all I hear is someone telling her, and I just hear her go, fuck them.  Yeah, that's what you don't care.  I actually said.  Say it.  You said, fuck them.  Fuck her.  Oh, fuck her.  Fuck her.  What was it?  She made fun of my hair.  She made fun of me.  She said, I was brought up in the Roosevelt.  What did she say?  Roosevelt era.  What was it?  That fucking Stassi?  What's her name?  Yeah, yeah.  Linda Stassi.  Linda Stassi.  Yeah.  She had no fucking race.  She's probably bald. 
[03:03:00]  She's like, he doesn't need his mom.  She wouldn't be bald, that fucking old lady.  What did she say?  He doesn't need his mom to succeed.  Anyway, she's from like the Roosevelt era.  She looks like she's right out of the Roosevelt era.  Oh, man.  Let me say something about me.  Like, I woke up my shirt open.  Oh, that he glorifies the stereotype.  But that's true.  The Italian stereotype.  Oh, fucking bitch.  And what?  I think she's a paisan, too.  But you should have made fun of somebody's mom.  Exactly, right?  She's obviously not a mom, right? 
[03:03:30]  Probably not.  I hope not.  Not with that job.  Exactly.  You know what?  Moms get a pass.  Yeah.  They get a pass with everybody.  They don't goof on moms.  Yeah.  How was Lil Wayne?  Lil Wayne was like super respectful.  Just like when you bring anyone around a mom, they become like little boys.  He took off his hat.  Nice to meet you.  Thank you.  Did he offer us some Sizzurp?  No, we didn't drink the Sizzurp.  This was pre-Sizzurp, Lil Wayne.  He wasn't on drugs?  The only thing I told him, I told him.  Probably, but I don't know. 
[03:04:00]  I told him.  I told him to dispense up.  Right, right, right.  You're embarrassing my insult to us.  You're an embarrassment.  You're going to tell people to lift their pants up?  Look at you.  You're insulting me and my family.  You're a walking insult.  Now, this isn't a set.  This isn't some stage.  This is your house.  Yes.  Did you have any reservations about opening your house up to these people?  No, I really did not realize. 
[03:04:30]  Not that I didn't realize.  You know, it's a big old house.  And I raised, you know, 30 years were there.  And I raised my kids there.  See, the thing is.  It's not a fancy house.  Yeah, I never even had friends come over.  Because it's a tiny house.  My apartment was like.  We have one bathroom.  We live in an apartment, basically.  And then it went from that to being the set.  And then I told MTV and everyone.  I said, you know, there's other places.  We go to my aunt's house.  You know what I mean?  I'm buying a new house.  We can go to that one.  They're like, no, we want this nitty gritty, raunchy apartment right here. 
[03:05:00]  It's not raunchy, Vinny.  Oh, hey, Vinny.  Come on now.  It's tight.  It's tight.  Tight.  How many people live in their house?  Yeah, but you know what it is?  We never had like a.  We had wives.  They had their own room.  You're smart enough, motherfucker.  But I had my own room.  But we didn't have like a living room.  It was just a kitchen, you know?  Everyone, like you walk into the living room.  Then all of a sudden, they're in my mother's room.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It has railroad rooms, you know?  Yeah, you can tell. 
[03:05:30]  Each step is a different room.  But we made my sister's room, the green room.  We made my mother's room, the dining room.  Yeah, they turned.  And we put lights in.  There's lights hanging up in the ceiling.  Now, how often is this intrusion on your life happening?  Every day for two months.  It's every day for two months.  Yeah, not every day.  But we go according, like sometimes four times a week.  But you can't really break everything down.  No, it stays up.  So it stays up.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what you're saying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Actually, I bought a new house with my Jersey Shore money.  Nice.  And now we run away.  So at the same time that we were filming, we were sleeping in the new house. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, okay.  That works.  But it's like an empty house.  How big is it?  It's pretty.  It's a decent size.  It's bigger than this one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I bought it for me, my mother, and my sisters.  And I live in the downstairs.  Why do you live with your family?  Because you're a successful guy.  I mean, I live at Home Brothers 30.  But do you just like living with your family?  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  I wanted to, like I said, I wanted to get them out of that little apartment.  You know, and I don't have it like that where I can buy them a house and me a house.  And you a house.  Sure.  I kind of bought a house that has two houses in one. 
[03:06:30]  I live in the basement.  I made it like a sick apartment.  You would still live with us.  No, ma.  It's a very Italian thing to do.  But soon I want to get out there and get my independence.  I just travel a lot so much that I end up coming home and I want to just eat my mother's  cooking, do my laundry.  And do the laundry.  Does mom do your laundry or do you do it?  No, my mother does it.  Your mother does it.  How much, boy?  Yeah.  A hundred percent.  I can't wash this shit.  If I do it, it smells like shit.  You probably need to wash in the toilet.  I guess.  Don't wash in the toilet.  Don't wash in the fucking toilet. 
[03:07:00]  Don't wash in the toilet.  Don't wash in the toilet.  It smells like shit.  What?  He said?  He said don't wash the clothes in the toilet if it smells like shit.  It smells like shit.  See?  I don't mind.  And I don't need a reservation to go to the house.  I just show up when the food is served.  I show up to eat.  You just show up.  I didn't even know how we got on the show.  No reservation.  Yeah.  Well, now, are you cooking every night?  This isn't every night you cook.  Now, would you normally cook every night?  Yes.  Wow.  She cooks during the day too.  Day and night.  Day and night.  But she cooks for everyone. 
[03:07:30]  The crew.  Like, she'll like.  Wow.  And they don't want her to.  They actually have real catering.  Right.  But she'll like just in between takes.  Like, so frying up potatoes and eggs and making little Nutella sandwiches.  You know what it is?  I'm comfortable when I'm doing that.  Right.  So, it's just.  It's a good.  Like, I don't pay attention to the cameras.  I don't.  You know.  That's my.  That's where I'm comfortable.  You like to cook.  I like to cook.  And I like people to be happy with what. 
[03:08:00]  Right.  You know what I mean?  Now, are you the mom that just would never sit down at family dinners?  Always up.  Yeah.  Running around.  They never sit down and enjoy the food themselves.  My kids tell me 30 years.  They've never seen me.  No.  I don't think I've ever sat down with her at a dinner table night.  No.  No.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  Like me with my mother.  She never says that.  Yeah.  Grandma.  Never.  Never.  How many people normally without the TV show would be eating at your house on a Sunday?  On a Sunday.  Whenever your night is.  Like 30 or something every Sunday?  We're a big family with six kids. 
[03:08:30]  Every Sunday.  Yeah.  Everywhere comes over.  Every Sunday.  Wow.  You come to 30 people.  We're six kids and we all have children.  Right.  We're all married.  It's all the sisters and the grandmother.  And now there's grandchildren, you know.  Oh, you mean your brothers and sisters too.  How many of you are there, Vinny?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Three of us.  Okay, okay.  And then every.  Then there's six of them.  Oh.  And each one of them has kids.  Yes.  And then they started to have kids.  How do you fit that many people?  It's not in our house.  We do it at my aunt.  We all live in the same neighborhood.  Yeah, sure, sure.  Oh, so you do it that way.  Yeah, I could do it in my raunchy house. 
[03:09:00]  I still make it.  I raunchy.  I managed to get there.  I still, I live far, but I managed to get there.  Do you have any kids?  Yeah, he does.  And his son.  He has a beautiful son.  His son is like straight edge, going to school to be a dentist.  He's like the smartest kid in the world.  All he does is study.  Doesn't go out.  Does he roll his eyes at his dad a lot?  I guess.  How many times has your son said if someone's like, who's that?  I don't know.  I've never met that man.  He just goes like this all the time, Blaze. 
[03:09:30]  He goes, shakes his head.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Poor kid.  Poor kid.  It's not his fault to be my son.  I love to die.  He's in college?  Yes.  Yeah, he's in college.  Smartest kid ever.  It's so weird.  And then his girl that he lives with is like this Buddhist massage therapist who's  like one with the earth and environment.  Amen.  Who meditates.  He's chance every day.  Yeah, but I tell you, Vinny.  She's his.  He's her.  Project.  You know when life every project ends.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:10:00]  He's.  Yeah.  She wants to go to heaven.  So she's, you know.  So she's.  Yeah.  Where'd you find her, Nino?  Huh?  Where'd you find her?  Huh?  He was like her, like a little pool boy or something.  Yeah.  He used to cook for her and do things around the house.  And then she like eventually has moved them in.  And he hasn't paid for a thing in 10 years.  I'm a great cook.  She lived alone for years, for 17 years.  So she says, yeah, I can take care of your back when she massaged her up. 
[03:10:30]  She's very good at what she does.  She's been doing it for 35 years.  Yeah.  She says, I can help you with your back and you cook for me.  So I don't have to go out and I have to dinner.  Yeah, it's a funnisher.  You were a funnisher.  So I cook.  I cook.  You can cook?  I'm a great cook.  Yeah.  I mean, I can joke.  I was a cook.  I worked in a nut house.  In a nut house as a cook.  I served soup to nuts.  You worked there in the service island?  Yes.  Soup to nuts.  He said he served soup to nuts.  That's funny. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, but you don't speak English, bro.  They don't understand you.  I served soup to nuts.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  I worked at a part-time job in a drugstore.  There's a lady comes in.  She says, sir, do you have cotton balls?  I said, I'm a fucking red dog.  What the fuck, man?  You have cotton balls.  What the fuck, man?  Cotton balls.  Cotton balls.  Cotton balls.  Oh, so you didn't really work in a mental institution?  Oh, I was really sure you were going to get into that.  He was in the mental institution. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, my God.  Of course, I owned the restaurant for 30 years.  I owned the restaurant called Guido's.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Well, you know, so, and it fits here with me and the Guido.  Now they call me the original Guido.  Ah, right, right.  So you owned a restaurant called Guido's for 30 years.  Guido's are in Great Neck.  Best supper club in the United States.  1979, 1980, 81.  Three years.  Yeah, Great Neck.  Supper club would what?  Have shows?  Yeah.  What kind of shows?  Piano, ball, you know, piano, ball, everything.  Supper club, you know.  Sing.  That sounds nice. 
[03:12:00]  The partner just happened to be a single white female.  Yeah.  Older.  Now, have you...  I was 20, she was 42.  Right.  Have you been on Staten Island?  You were born and raised there?  I was born in Sicily.  Oh, okay.  So when we came over from Italy...  Can you let somebody else talk beside you?  Whoa!  That's what I said.  They told me to shut the fuck up.  Of course, they both should, Dino.  That's why when I come in the show, I usually just go like this.  He goes, that's my sister. 
[03:12:30]  She told me to shut the fuck up.  All right.  So Sicily, how old were you when you came over?  Ten.  Ten years old.  Oh, man.  But then she went to Staten Island to my block, Bradley Avenue.  Bradley Avenue.  And she's never been there for Bradley Avenue for 36 years.  I think this is her first time in Manhattan, right?  Wow.  Went to California this month.  We went to L.A. for like a month.  I actually had never been anywhere.  I went to visit Vinny in Miami for the first time in 35 years. 
[03:13:00]  When we were filming Jersey Shore.  First time she got on plane.  Yeah.  I had never gone anywhere.  First time.  Anywhere.  Nowhere.  Didn't you get bored, though, just being in the same environment?  Doesn't that get like...  No.  There's plenty to cook.  Exactly.  Cook for 30 years.  I never wanted to leave my...  I had opportunities to go, like vacation and stuff, but I never will leave my kids.  Yeah, yeah.  Ever.  Even like now we're like 40 years old.  Yeah.  She's still only...  Not leaving my babies.  She always sets a different goal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, okay, once they graduate college. 
[03:13:30]  Right.  Now, once they're high school, then college.  Right.  Now, once they get married.  Once they get married.  Once she gets divorced.  Even like work-wise, I always work nights because I wanted to be home with them during the  day.  So, even like I used to work nights, nights, you know, whatever.  What did you do for work?  I worked in a diner for a...  Just like a manager in a diner.  Manager in a diner for 22 years.  Wow.  Same diner.  How many drunks did you see going through there?  Plenty.  Plenty.  Plenty.  But I used to work 70 hours, 80 hours a week. 
[03:14:00]  Up until like we started filming this show.  Two months ago.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  So that Vinny could have his fancy shoes.  Yay!  Yeah, you stopped buying them a while ago.  So, how was it going to Miami?  I mean, that's like alien territory.  We were only there for three days, right, Vin?  When you're so...  I think when you're somewhere for so long and you go somewhere like that, it almost is surreal  to you.  Yeah, yeah.  It's almost like you didn't remember it. 
[03:14:30]  No.  I didn't.  I went to the hotel and then to visit you at the house and then to the beach once.  Get me back to my...  She's like, I got to get back to my stove.  Yeah, exactly.  That was my stove.  Oh, my God.  California, are you slow?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're in California for a month.  And then we had no choice.  I had to stay in L.A.  Yeah, we filmed a little of the show in L.A.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was hard.  I had a bullet.  Yeah.  Well, I don't doubt you were tearing it up out there.  I'm getting back real quick.  I'm sure.  Were you scared to fly?  I was.  Yeah?  I was. 
[03:15:00]  I'm sure a couple of Xanax.  A couple of Xanax.  I was better going.  Coming back, I took Xanax.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  I'm scared to fly.  I hate it.  I just sit through it and I just kill myself.  I've kind of gotten used to it over the years.  I got worse.  Really?  I used to be great at it.  I used to be on a plane when Jersey Shore first came out, three to four times a week.  Yeah.  Flying to two different cities doing appearances.  And then some reason, after a while, it just got worse and worse.  It started getting to you.  Really?  Yeah.  And now I just hate it.  I dread it.  Yeah.  You came home one day. 
[03:15:30]  Now you got something to lose.  It's like, damn, I'm doing all right here.  Shit.  I don't want this plane going bad.  When you flew out, did you fly in the front of the plane or the back of the plane?  First class.  Oh, you went first?  Of course.  Then you put me in the first.  Nice.  First team.  That's not how it always is.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's not the good flight.  Don't get used to that, Ma.  Put me in the back.  He's in cargo.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He wasn't in with me.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure.  Let's fuck us here in the plane.  Let's see him.  I'm close to the bathroom, though.  I grab it, but I take a piss right there. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, I got to get hypnotized or something.  I got to figure it out.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm actually thinking about taking pilot lessons just to become comfortable with it.  Yeah, yeah.  You're a great show player, right?  Exactly.  That would be a bad idea.  You could do that.  Don't watch that video from Afghanistan at the 747.  I didn't.  I saw it.  It was terrible.  I watched the movie Flight, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was a good movie.  Yeah, yesterday, I guess a video came out from Afghanistan of a 747 going down on someone's  dash cam.  They saw it.  Holy moly.  It's probably the clearest. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, but they only said like seven people died.  Yeah, there was a cargo plane.  Oh, it was a cargo plane.  The cargo wasn't fastened.  It slid to the back of the plane when it was taken off, and it just went, wah.  Don't worry about that happening in Nino.  Yeah.  To the black of the plane.  Hey.  So did you have a bad flight or something that fucked you up?  Because I've had some scary flights that kind of made the next one frightening.  I've had, yeah.  I've had like really bad turbulence, and it made it messed up, but I don't even know if  it was that.  I can't.  I remember when that, when you made that decision, Randy.  It literally just gradually, the thing with me is, I've talked about like anxiety in here 
[03:17:00]  and stuff.  Right, right, right.  And the thing with me is that my mind just like doesn't accept ignorance as bliss.  Like if I hear something, I need to know about it.  If I feel something, I need to know about it.  And on a plane, there's so much that you don't know and hear and shit.  Where everyone else is just like, oh, I'm going to play my game, you know, whatever.  You're like, what the fuck is that?  Yeah, I'm like, what's that?  What is that?  Give me more scotch.  Why is that?  By the time I hear that, I'm thinking about the next thing.  And then another thing, my adrenaline's all high.  There's so many moving parts on this thing. 
[03:17:30]  But the flight attendant's not panicking.  A lot of times, like, it used to scare me when you take off, and then all of a sudden  you hear like, and you feel the engine stop.  But I realize it's just the cabin pressure changing.  Like, I thought the engines were slowing down.  They have to for noise.  They have to do that.  I've been researching.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I mean, I thought the engines were shutting off.  Yeah, yeah, you thought you were about to go, oh, I'm dropping down.  It was just the cabin pressure.  Yeah, no, you're still going like 600 miles per hour.  Yeah, they pull back.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Um, I don't know what it is.  You know what's funny, though? 
[03:18:00]  When it's like a smooth flight and shit, I'm like having a ball.  Yeah.  The landing's my favorite part.  Because I'm like, oh, I'm about to be home.  Hey, here it is.  You know, but meanwhile, people are scared about that.  They're like, oh, please hit it.  Most crashes are takeoffs and landings.  Exactly.  I'm the calmest.  That's where I'm the calmest.  That's your calmest.  Yeah.  I bug out when we're just like chilling three hours in, and then all of a sudden we're just  like just rocking around.  I just, you know, I think everyone has a little problem with the thought of plummeting.  Yeah.  No one wants to plummet.  Right.  But no one else is thinking about it.  No.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm the one that's thinking about it. 
[03:18:30]  Well, I'm sure there's other people that are that look at you and think he's not thinking  about it because you probably hide it.  Yeah, I do hide it.  You know, you sit there.  You're not freaking out like Shatner in Twilight Zone.  Oh, my God.  It's a man on the wing.  By the way, who conceptualized this show?  It's your favorite show, Nino, right?  The Twilight Zone.  Actually, that little guy.  I was either flying on the wing or in the backseat, you know?  Yeah.  So that was a look at the wing.  I expect that little guy to come up, you know?  Remember the Twilight Zone?  Yeah, yeah.  He had a man on the wing.  He just said it.  William Shatner. 
[03:19:00]  They got him.  I was doing drugs.  I was doing drugs.  I'd be like, what the fuck?  So, yeah.  I was doing drugs.  It was the last 20 minutes of my life.  How was the show conceptualizing?  Well, basically, I started to do improv, and I do stand-up comedy.  Not do it, but I did it once.  But I do UCB.  So, shut up.  Fuck up.  So, when I went to them, I said, listen, I want to do something else that's not reality,  you know?  And they always put me on their little...  MTV has a million shows, like talking head shows and stuff, and I've done acting stuff 
[03:19:30]  for them.  And then they will...  You know, I guess they saw that there was more to me than just follow me around and  watch me drink.  And then...  But America does know me with my family.  They know me from Staten Island.  So, we wanted to incorporate that on...  So, we're not going to have a sitcom.  You know what I'm saying?  Because you don't have to script these people.  And then, plus, I guess the network wanted a place where artists and actors can come promote  their stuff, and it's never been done before.  So, we gave it a whirl.  Who have you had on, besides Lil Wayne? 
[03:20:00]  We had Kesha, Mark Wahlberg, Anthony Mackie, A$AP Rocky, Red Foo, Whitney Cummings, Jenny McCarthy,  a lot of people.  Just like a lot of current pop culture MTV audience people.  One of my favorites was Tyler, the fucking...  Tyler, the creator.  He's a fucking look.  Sierra.  Oh, the list is right here.  Perez Hilton.  Who was the girl that sat on...  Got on her knees under the table?  Oh, Iggy Azalea.  Yeah, what was that all about, man?  I came in.  That's where I came in tea, and you were under the fucking table.  What was the girl on there?  Well, no.  This girl, Iggy Azalea, you ever hear of her? 
[03:20:30]  No.  She's like this tall Australian...  She's like seven feet tall.  Wilhelmina.  She's a model, but she's like a gangster rapper.  And she's hot.  She good?  She's hot.  But she was trying to feed me, and she couldn't reach the table.  We didn't have a chair, so she got on her knees.  And I'm like literally five seconds into the interview, and I'm like, this is awesome.  You know what I mean?  Like five minutes, the girl's on her knees.  What?  What's she doing on her knees?  She was cold, so that's how she reached the table.  My mother had a heart attack, but Jenny McCarthy was in my bedroom, in my bed. 
[03:21:00]  I grew up in...  She was very forward.  Yeah.  She was very forward.  Yeah.  She was very nice.  She was very nice.  They kicked me out of that episode.  They kicked me out.  They kicked me in their fucking garage.  They were leaving the house.  You were saying before that everybody's been respectful or anything, but has anybody done  anything that you were kind of like, oh, this is my house?  Well, the women.  Yeah.  Well, Jenny McCarthy, yeah.  She started talking about SCX.  SCX.  SCX.  SCX.  SCX.  SCX.  SCX.  Well.  That's a little...  I'll say what you want to say, and I'll say what I want to say. 
[03:21:30]  Oh.  Wait.  She always fucking gives it to me.  She always fucking gives it to me.  God damn, Nino.  But you didn't like the dirty talk.  You don't mind a little cursing, but the dirty talk.  And then my daughter on one side...  I have a daughter who's 20 who hasn't dated yet.  So 21, they're now out to date.  Oh.  Yeah.  And, you know, they respect that.  My older daughter's 28 now, and now she says, Mommy did the right thing. 
[03:22:00]  And this one is 20, and she hasn't dated yet.  Wow.  Even though she likes a boy now, I know.  Oh.  White kid?  But she's going to be 21 in February.  Yeah, don't fuck that, right?  Don't fucking quit.  Don't fucking quit.  I was like, what the fuck?  Don't fucking quit.  I mean, that was the thing that way you're crazy.  That was the most serious question anyone's ever asked.  I haven't seen you respond like that.  Nino.  I have no idea what's happening.  Bro, Nino.  Stop.  Bro, you're on TV.  What?  Your mother wouldn't go for that one.  She's into a guy.  She's just getting permission out.  And I said, is it a white guy?  Oh. 
[03:22:30]  And Nino's like, what the fuck?  Oh.  Come on.  Of course.  Hey, what are you talking about?  What the fuck is that better?  What the fuck is that?  You know what?  It's 2013, Nino.  Come on.  It doesn't matter?  No, I'm not.  I like dark girls.  I'm not like that.  You wouldn't care, though, your little girl.  I think it's shot in the dark all the time.  Your little girl comes home with a black guy.  Normally, if you look at the average of Italian families, they don't want their little girl  coming home with a black guy.  No, we don't really discriminate.  I don't know.  If it made her happy.  I was always told, because we don't discriminate. 
[03:23:00]  Sure.  Oh, my gosh.  Shut up.  Oh, my gosh.  Shut up.  Is he going to shut up, Nino?  Nah.  Anyway, so I think what happened was I figured it out like 40 years later, because I'm here.  I'm 53, 43 years.  Anyway, when I came to America, I didn't speak a word of English. 
[03:23:30]  None of us did.  So, by coincidence, the neighbor, like my grandfather lived on Bradley.  The neighbor was a black family, African-American, and also on the other side.  And these people really, if it wasn't for them, a girl named Deborah, I was really heavy,  heavy.  I had never seen a black person.  Oh, wow.  I swear to God.  I love it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was pretty girl.  She was so chubby.  Oh, my God.  Vinny's getting so nervous with this conversation.  I had never seen a black person.  Uh-huh. 
[03:24:00]  And Deborah, she used to put me on the bus every morning, take me to the bus stop.  Uh-huh.  Vinny's panicking.  What's that?  I love this.  It's a nice story.  I know.  Vinny's hyperventilating.  He's panicking.  Why?  He's watching his MTV deal disappear.  It's a sweet story for me.  But anyway, so later on in life, I had people tell me, people that I really didn't care for  too much.  Yes.  They used to tell me, oh, you're like that because you're an immigrant too, you know, 
[03:24:30]  and, and, you know, you were, you were, um, a minority.  Right.  So that's why I don't discriminate.  Uh-huh.  You know, which is bullshit probably.  But maybe that had something to do with it.  Maybe it did.  I don't know.  She put you on the bus.  Yeah.  Your first experience with black people was pleasant.  Yeah, you just were under the bus.  Pleasant.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She made sure every morning she used to come to the house, take me by the hand. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  You too, Nino?  Oh, my God.  How did you grow up with this guy?  How did you grow up with this guy?  You know what?  It's always been like this.  As it always, right?  Yes.  That's why my father used to beat the shit out of me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Did Nino get beat a lot?  Yeah.  No, no.  Yeah, my father was...  To get the strap?  Yeah.  The strap.  The buckle.  Only him.  Oh, man.  Only him.  I wonder why.  I don't know, just me. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, I wonder why.  So, how did he react when he was getting beaten?  He stood there.  He stood there.  He took it.  He said, hey, you hit me.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's where it was.  Yeah.  Everything's a day.  I mean, hey, what the fuck?  What the fuck?  Yeah, he didn't used to talk to him like that.  He said, hey, you don't.  He couldn't run.  Bob, what the fuck?  You had to take it with daddy.  Holy shit.  Yeah, somebody.  So, I was going to look great.  Didn't work anyway. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  Well, we're about through for the day.  Oh, great.  Thank God.  Stay tuned for it.  I'm sorry to bring no wine today.  It's all right.  I'm sorry to bring no wine.  It's all right.  Yeah, yeah.  That's stuff.  Where's my buddy O?  Where's Opie?  Opie, he's taking care of his kids.  His kid's got a little flu.  I was the kid.  His kid's got a little flu.  So, he was up all night with the kid.  He's the nurse.  He's the nurse.  So, he, yeah, yeah.  You know how it is.  Let him tell us about our show.  Shut up.  Shut up.  It's called The Show with Vinny.  Shut the fuck up.  The Show with Vinny premieres this Thursday, May 2nd, tomorrow night. 
[03:26:30]  It's 10 o'clock on MTV.  And, you know, it's Vinny.  No matter what race you are, watch it.  Exactly.  It's all inclusive.  Yeah, absolutely.  Let me know.  It's an international show.  Everybody can watch it.  Yes.  It's, uh, it's obviously a very entertaining family.  And, uh, you know, I would certainly suggest watching it to see people kind of come in  and mix.  It's a, it's a really different idea for a show.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's, it's, you're thrusting two worlds together and it's hilarious.  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks so much for coming in.  Thanks, Travis.  Fantastic.  Thanks so much.  Your mom's adorable. 
[03:27:00]  I love it.  And Nino, you're, what the fuck?  It's actually pretty good.  What the fuck?  I'm tied up over it.  What the fuck?  I'm tied up over it.  He's tangled in the headphone cords.  I don't know what the hell he's doing.  Thank you.  Take care.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Thank you.  Very good.  Little hugs and kisses going on here.  Hey, Nino, how you doing, my friend?  Hey, how?  All right, my friend.  Nino.  Take care, huh?  You're a white albino.  A white albino. 
[03:27:30]  There it is.  He's saying his goodbyes to Roland.  And, uh, out the, there he goes.  Take it easy, my friend.  Holy shit.  He's an entertaining guy, though.  He really is, yeah, yeah.  I know, he is.  He's a nice guy.  I like, I like him with the contrast of Vinny and, and his mom, because, uh, you know,  his mom just telling him to shut the fuck up.  It's hilarious.  Vinny was really in a panic when his mom started telling the story about the black family that  lived next door.  Yes.  He was worried that fucking Nino was going to blurt something out. 
[03:28:00]  Well, if you remember.  He was quiet.  Yeah.  And then TV guy goes, oh, Uncle Nino's very quiet.  I was like, oh, yeah, sure he is.  This way.  Now, Nino, uh, if you remember, he was telling some, some off-color jokes a few times back  when he was in.  And Vinny was just like, because he just sees his whole career going down the shitter,  because his fucking uncle blurted something stupid out in this day and age.  They don't care.  Yeah.  Uh, Jimmy Norton's show is coming up, uh, ASAP.  Uh, you got any pluggy-wuggies?

Marc Maron, he's, uh, been a comedian for 25 years, had his problems, but with the popularity of his WTF podcast and his career, his life is turning around.  Marin stars comedian Marc Maron, exploring a fictionalized version of his life, including relationships, his career, and his podcast.  The show takes a look at Marc's day-to-day struggle to maintain relationships, other than his only two successful ones, the relationship he has with his podcast audience, and the ones with his, uh, beloved cats. 
[03:31:30]  People are saying Marin is uniquely fascinating, absolutely compelling, and brutally funny.  Marin features guest stars like Judd Hirsch, Gina Gershon, Aubrey Plaza, Adam Scott, and, uh, Dave Foley stars in this week's episode.  Dave and Marc, they go after an abusive fan on Twitter who's been tormenting Marc, who wouldn't want to do that right, of course.  Tune in to Marin, starting Friday, May 3rd, at 10, 9 Central, on IFC. 
[03:32:00]  Asti Spumanti.  Opie and Anthony have left the building.  But Jim Norton is not going anywhere.  If you have problems at home, it's your lucky day.  The Jim Norton Show is next.  Jim Norton is a moderately successful comedian, an average author, and a terrible actor.  And your chance to speak directly with him has arrived. 
[03:32:30]  Call 866-969-1969.  And the Jim Norton Show starts now.  Hello, everyone.  I am, uh, howling here, to use, uh, Opie's term, hold on.  Uh, somebody Twittered something which really made me laugh.  Because Uncle Nino was in here just spitting out lines, and someone wrote that with all these lines flying around. 
[03:33:00]  It sounds like Uncle Chip now is in studio.  Oh, my God.  That made me fucking laugh.  So, uh, you know, I was saying to E-Rock, we have a couple calls already.  But, uh, you know, I would be interested to interview Uncle Nino about his stroke.  Or about, like, getting hit as a kid.  Like, the guy, because that family was not meant for fame.  They were just a regular family. 
[03:33:30]  We're talking about Vinny from Jersey Shore.  And then he gets this gig, and all of a sudden he's famous.  And now the family's on TV.  So they weren't geared up for all these years.  They're just regular people who've kind of gotten fame now.  So I'd be interested to talk about his real life.  Like, he does a lot of one-liners, and he's silly.  But I think he'd be much more interesting just to kind of, to really talk to him.  I think that would be difficult for you to do.  It's a defense mechanism a lot of the time.  I know.  If he was alone, it wouldn't be.  You could probably get a real interview out of him.  Okay, let's go to Jerome in Florida.  Any idea why guys dress in women's clothes? 
[03:34:00]  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, Jerome.  Do you want to dress in women's clothes?  No, I got a buddy of mine who was just caught with women's shoes and stuff.  He was just talking in his car after being injured in the hospital.  And it's really strange.  So this whole relationship that my friend is involved in is taking a weird turn.  So he caught her cheating mentally by constantly texting her and calling this dude that she knew.  And then all of a sudden, like, now the guy is hiding his own things. 
[03:34:30]  Like, his own, you know, whatever this is.  Hold on one thing at a time.  What people say, like, Ed Wood is a very famous transvestite, or not even cross-dresser, where he would wear women's clothing while he directed.  But he wasn't gay.  He loved women.  And he said, no, I love women.  I just feel closer to them when I wear their clothes.  So there are guys that like dressing in women's clothes that are not homosexual.  They don't have homosexual inclinations.  They just enjoy the way it feels. 
[03:35:00]  That's not my thing.  I almost wish it was.  Like, I put on panties one time for a girl who asked me to, and it felt really good.  Like, it felt like your dick felt great, and then your dick felt huge because it bulged out of them.  Like, I could understand the turn-on of that without it being a gay thing.  So you're saying, but what's it got to do with the fact that his girlfriend was cheating?  No, his wife.  Like, that's the thing about it.  Like, he's got obsessed with trying to track his wife down, making sure she's not texting who she's not supposed to, calling people who she's not supposed to. 
[03:35:30]  And then all of a sudden, like, you know, if some accident happens, he's not able to hide his stuff or be, you know, what he's been doing.  Like, she caught him with all the spy gear and all these, like, phone records.  Wait, spying on her or other people?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, spying, like, spying on his wife.  So he became completely insecure with their relationship, I believe.  And, you know, these are people who are, like, close family to me now because, you know, our kids are growing up together, and we hang out with them, like, every week. 
[03:36:00]  And, like, I don't know what to do with this guy.  Well, those things are probably, they might not be connected.  Him liking women's clothes might have nothing to do with the fact that his wife was possibly cheating or he was obsessed with her cheating.  They're just different things.  But you're saying that not the, I'm sorry, but you're saying that they're not the people that you thought they were or he's not the guy you thought he was.  That's, that's kind of more like it is, of that is, because she's getting the sense, like, who is this guy that I'm married to for a couple, for nine years or so, and then.  Was she cheating? 
[03:36:30]  Well, I mean, sort of, like, you know, texting this guy, and then, you know, I understand they're completely not related, but, but now he's hiding his own shit, and, and.  Maybe she did know about that.  Okay, she just told us, like, last night, literally, because of what happened to him, and, you know, she was searching his car and stuff, and, and in the, in the trunk was, like, a box with, you know, one pair of her high heels.  And then, and then his, like, three or four pairs of 11-inch pumps with stockings, and, and shows her a picture of him dressed in, and, like, he's freaking out. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, okay.  I believe him, so.  You know, and I'm supposed to be friends with this guy.  I don't know what to tell him.  I'm not supposed to know this information.  Well, you can be friends with him, dude, because, again, unless it's something with kids or something where he's forcing himself on somebody, a guy's sexual stuff, he has it whether you knew it or not.  He is the guy you thought he was, meaning all that private stuff, and thank you for the call, buddy.  I appreciate you calling in.  Yeah, no problem.  Thank you, Jim. 
[03:37:30]  You're the best.  Um, that existed before you knew it.  So, you, you shouldn't judge people, and, again, unless they're, you find that they're really hurting somebody or they're molesting kids or fucking dogs, but if you find out somebody likes to dress in women's clothes, that is the person you were friends with.  It's not like all of a sudden they were, you know, you don't tell everybody your sexual shit.  Like, how many of you guys out there like your asshole lick, and you never talk to a buddy at work about it, or you like your asshole finger, or you like your wife to slap you, or you like to choke her?  All that private shit is just what it is. 
[03:38:00]  It's just private stuff, and, you know, you should feel bad for your friend that his wife would come and tell you guys this.  Uh, she should have kept that private.  She's the, of both of them, she's the worst one, from what I've heard, because she was actually dirty texting with somebody.  Her husband knew it and was following, and like, alright, what the fuck is she doing?  But he looks like the bad guy, because he actually gets spy equipment and catches her doing some dirty shit.  Uh, let's talk to, uh, Manuel in Oakland.  I need to tell my overly sensitive wife she smells. 
[03:38:30]  What's up, Jimmy?  Hi, Manuel.  Uh, now, she smells.  Is she fat, or does her pussy smell, or is her breath?  Well, no, she has body odor.  She's a little larger.  She weighs about 200 pounds.  Okay.  So she has a musty smell, and also, too, when we have sex, man, you just smell her box.  Okay, now, has it always been that way, or is it something newer?  Well, the body odor, she, um, that, that's always, that's always been around since I've  known her, and she's always been good about taking two showers during the day, and, you 
[03:39:00]  know, taking care of it.  But now, lately, she goes to bed smelling like that.  You know, just smells like, it starts smelling like a dude.  Like, I'm living with a dude.  And, and, and, does her pussy always smelled after sex, or during sex?  That, that has been in the last year or so.  Huh.  I wonder if she's a, sometimes women's chem, how old is she?  Uh, 30.  I don't know what age women's chemistry changes at, but maybe she's got some kind of a weird  yeast infection, or some kind of a weird chemical thing, because there's, there's, like, certain 
[03:39:30]  times you'll fuck a girl, and there's just, like, this sour, awful odor coming out, and it's  because they have a yeast infection, maybe she's got something, she's, uh, you know,  there's something chemically has changed for her.  I mean, that's a Dr. Steve question, really.  But the way to talk to her about it is to talk to her about it.  It's embarrassing, but the bottom line is, if she stinks, and if her pussy stinks, you  should probably not say it like that.  But, uh, you might want to, to, to broach the subject gently.  Well, why don't you offer to take a shower with her before you guys fuck? 
[03:40:00]  Like, hey, let's hop in the shower together and do that.  And then maybe she'll get the hint when you spend 55 minutes, you know, soaping out  her vagina.  Well, man, it's hard enough to try to, you know, try to, try to even initiate it.  I pretty much got to sneak up on the pussy and try to even get anything going.  Oh, why?  Is she trying to kind of cold?  Maybe she's self-conscious about being fat.  Well, yeah, I mean, all those are, all those are issues, and, and they've all been  addressed at some point, but it's like, okay, well, okay, come on.  We both know what, what these issues are, let's, let's, let's get going.  But yeah, I mean, again, it's, she's overly sensitive and just me barely mentioning anything 
[03:40:30]  about anything, it starts a fight.  Yeah.  Cause basically a lot of times people don't want to hear the truth and they want to continue  doing the way, what they're doing or behaving the way they're behaving.  So they play the sensitivity card because it's an excuse not to take any action.  You know, if you're cruel about it, then sensitivity is probably how she should feel.  Now, but if she's just, you know, look, if she's putting weight on and she's not fucking  you and she's smelling bad, um, you have every right to not be happy with that. 
[03:41:00]  Have you gotten heavier or do you smell bad?  Nah, I'm about the same.  Um, as far as smelling bad, I'm, you know, I'm kind of conscious as soon as I get home  from work, you know, I'm in the shower.  Um, she, she made her notions about my breath and, you know, I, I try to take care of her  as best as I can.  What was wrong with your breath?  Hey, she just said it's always, you know, it always smells.  So, you know, before I even come around or even give her a kiss, you know, go brush my  teeth, mouthwash the whole night. 
[03:41:30]  Well, hold on.  Why does your breath, wait, do you smoke or do you drink a lot of coffee?  No, I don't do any of that.  I, I, I haven't been to the dentist in a long time, so I'm pretty sure I got something  going on back there.  Okay.  You probably have a horrible, you might have figured out your own question here.  You probably have a horrible buildup of like tartar and plaque.  Um, and when you suck, like when you close your mouth and you suck through your teeth,  you could probably taste it and it makes your mouth stink.  Um, you should go get a cleaning because a brushing your teeth does not take care of 
[03:42:00]  it.  Like it will mask it for a few minutes, but that, that rotted tooth or that dry plaque  stink, that wet smell that comes from under your gums needs, you need to floss and you  need to fucking have that cleaned out.  Because what happens is when somebody is fucking you and they're smelling that.  And I know because I've, you know, I've been around people who have had bad breath and you  start to resent them and you start to fucking hate them because they don't know their breath  stinks.  And you're like, what the fuck is wrong with you? 
[03:42:30]  You have fucking breath stinks all the time and you're in my face and you want to kiss.  So maybe that's part of the reason she doesn't want to fuck as much.  So you should take care of that first and foremost, and then she'll have no, and then  see if it changes.  Really go to the dentist, get a cleaning, a good deep cleaning and a whitening and see  if that doesn't change things a little bit.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Good luck, man.  Now, Ken in Florida, he said, my wife passed away in 2009 and now my head hurts when I 
[03:43:00]  jerk off.  Jesus.  Well, how did she die, Ken?  Oh, she had leukemia.  It's Ben, not Ken.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's all right.  Okay.  I said Ken.  So how long were you married?  15 years.  Okay.  So she died of leukemia.  Have you hooked up with anybody since then?  No.  That's the whole thing.  I miss her so much.  You know what I mean?  I can't even, I can't even think about nobody else, but like, like I told the guy on the  phone, you know, I haven't even masturbated that much, but when I did, it felt like somebody 
[03:43:30]  hit me in the head with a bat.  Well, did you, when you were married, did you jerk off a lot or did you have mostly sex?  Everything, you know.  Do you feel guilty like thinking about other people?  No.  No, it's just that, you know, there's nobody I'm interested in, you know what I mean?  Wow.  I mean, there's a line with that stuff.  And again, I've never been married, so I can't say I understand that, but I guess  it's, I don't know what the normal grieving process is.  Like how long is it to grieve healthily over somebody? 
[03:44:00]  Maybe, maybe three years after being married, do you have kids together?  Yeah.  So there's a constant reminder of hers, obviously your kids.  Um, maybe that's normal to have a grieving process.  Maybe you're just a good guy.  Do you think that's like giving me that pain in my head?  Um, no, the pain in your head might just be grief.  I don't see a, you know, unless there's a physical problem, but you, every time you  jerk off, you get a horrible headache.  No, dude, it's not even a headache.  It's like somebody ran the car into my head. 
[03:44:30]  Like it's going to explode.  And it only happens when you jerk off.  Yeah.  Um, no, do you just jerk off normally or do you do anything weird when you jerk off?  No, no, no, no, dude.  Well, it's obviously psychological.  You know, from what I know, I'm not a doctor, but there's no connection between tugging your  dick.  Unless your dick, there's a string inside your body.  So like a fucking puppet, when you pull your dick, your head hits the headboard.  Unless, unless that's happening, it's completely psychological.  So maybe it's guilt or grief or it's, it's gotta be one of those things. 
[03:45:00]  So I don't, maybe give yourself a little more time and maybe go talk to somebody because  maybe, maybe that would help a grief counselor.  Cause there's obviously a lot.  What's that?  It might help.  You're right.  Yeah.  Because to not be able to jerk off like me, no matter how much I love someone, I could literally  jerk off fucking, you know, between the wake and burial.  I mean, I'm a, I'm a complete piece of garbage, but the fact that you, I could see you didn't 
[03:45:30]  fuck anybody for a long time.  Cause maybe you're still grieving, but to not be able to jerk off or get the poison  out.  Um, again, somebody else, but grief counselor may tell you that's normal.  I can't, I'm not qualified to answer that, but I would suggest a grief counselor.  Cause I think it's, it's gotta be psychological, dude.  Um, believe me, if there was any type of physical connection between jerking off and headaches,  I would have experienced it.  Yeah.  All right, dude.  Hey, listen, I want to thank you for being that different person you are on the phone 
[03:46:00]  than on the radio when people got their problems with drugs and alcohol.  Oh, of course.  It really hits my heart, man.  Thank you.  Okay, buddy.  Thanks for the call.  Good luck to you.  Absolutely.  Um, let's see, uh, Reed in Vegas.  I think my sponsor is using again.  How do I approach him about it?  Hi, Reed.  Hey, Jim.  So let's just say you go to a 12 step, you go to a 12 step program, let's say.  Right.  But I'm a, I'm a compulsive gambler and I've had this problem for 12 years.  Um, the last time I went back into a meeting, I, I, first day I got a sponsor and he's been 
[03:46:30]  my sponsor ever since.  He's in other programs for drugs and alcohol.  Um, but he's been so great.  You know, he's, I haven't gambled in a year and whatever, three months, but lately he's  had problems like with his knee and his back and like, I'll call him and he'll ramble on  and not know who I am.  And then at meetings, like he talked for 15 minutes, 15 minutes and it was like so uncomfortable. 
[03:47:00]  And I just don't know, like, I don't know if I should find another sponsor or if I should  approach him about this.  Well, if it's something that you feel is going to affect your sobriety or your, your  gambling sobriety, of course you should, because you know, you don't have the right to tell  him, day, don't drink, especially if you're not in a program for alcohol.  But if you need to talk to him for gambling or whatever it is that you, he's your sponsor  for, you have every right to expect that he's at least going to be coherent.  Um, and if you see him talking in meetings, you know, they say that the person who is 
[03:47:30]  a sponsor for you should be the top three people whose sobriety or who's gambling sobriety,  whatever it is you respect, your sponsor should be one of those people.  So if you find he's rambling in meetings and embarrassing, that might not make him one of  those top three anymore.  So I would suggest just talking about it, giving him a, cause he might be on temporary  medication that maybe he's not handling well.  Um, I, I would suggest talking to him about it, but you should always talk to somebody about 
[03:48:00]  it before you just leave.  But, but there's a way to ask somebody without accusing them.  Um, but I think that at least you owe him the question if you still want to continue working  with him.  Yeah.  I mean, he's the only one, you know, that's actually worked with me is, I mean, that even  started the steps and, you know, so it, you know, I, I feel like I owe a little bit of  my success to him, you know, in a way.  So I have some loyalty, but you know, I don't know, maybe, maybe because he's so much older,  I'm not, you know, I'm 33 and he's, you know, in his late fifties.  It's, it's like, it's kind of hard to, you know, almost like relate and get that, that 
[03:48:30]  talking.  Yeah.  Started.  Well, we, we, sometimes we look at sponsors as authority figures and it's, it's normal  to, to do that.  But the reality is they're not authority figures.  They're people who are guiding us, but they're also people who are disasters just like we  are.  You know, they're, they're, they're one, whatever it is away from being back to where  they were, whether it's a drink or a drug or a gambling episode.  So they're not perfect.  They're not saviors.  They're simply people who have more experience at living healthy than we do, but we're just 
[03:49:00]  as fucked up as we are.  So I think you have the right to ask him and you owe it to him.  Yeah, but you owe yourself more.  And, um, I would definitely suggest talking to him and seeing how he responds to that.  But you, you definitely should have the conversation.  You have the right to ask.  Okay.  Thank you so much, Jimmy.  I appreciate it.  Good luck, man, with the gambling.  That's a rough one.  I'm glad I don't have that one.  Hey, Jim.  Yes, sir.  Some people were calling in about the guy who was having the problem jerking off with  his head hurting.  Oh, okay.  A lot of them were saying it's, it looks like it might be blood pressure. 
[03:49:30]  Oh.  Some blood pressure issues.  There I am.  Fucking, uh, you know what?  Blood pressure issues, uh, so, all right.  If you're still listening, um, you know, hopefully you're not tugging your dick right now and  fucking grabbing your head like fucking, like, like the stepbrother in Omen 2.  Um, that was a goddamn good reference.  Come with me, Mark.  Uh, so, let's see who's got someone on that.  And I want to talk to the guy whose ex-wife's a drug addict.  But let's see who's got the, uh, are they just calling anyone on the phone?  They were just calling and just saying, let Jim know. 
[03:50:00]  Okay, well, thank you for that, because I had no idea that could be possible.  So, uh, Dr. Steve was probably like, you know, you really shouldn't be doing a medical  advice show, you fucking idiot.  So, try a blood pressure.  I probably could have got this guy killed with my advice.  That's fine.  Just keep jerking off.  He's having a stroke.  All right.  Uh, let's go to Ben in Penn.  Ex-wife's a drug addict and has turned the kids against you.  Hello, Ben.  Hey, Jimmy.  Thanks for taking my call, man.  Sure, sure.  I appreciate this.  Of course.  Hey, uh, I went through a really bad divorce.  Um, my wife started getting into pills and, uh, I just couldn't handle it anymore. 
[03:50:30]  It was either I left her or I was going to shoot her.  Um, went out, tried to get myself reestablished, kind of, more or less, you know,  left with the clothes on my back.  Man, everything I've ever worked for, she took, um, takes, you know, ungodly amounts  of my paycheck every week.  Um, my, my kids live in just, uh, utter filth.  I mean, it's horrible, man.  I've called, uh, youth and child services twice or, and they, they just don't seem to help. 
[03:51:00]  Um, and my kids, man, I, I mean, I don't even have a relationship with my kids.  It's, it's awful.  How old are they?  Um, I have a 14-year-old daughter and a 11-year-old son.  Now, let me ask you, why does this, why does your ex hate you so much?  Uh, she feels as though I left her down.  You know, I, I was looking for a way out of my marriage, Jimmy.  I, I found a, uh, I found a chick and I rolled.  Okay.  You found a better looking chick? 
[03:51:30]  Uh, yeah, she, yeah, she's, she's better all the way around.  Younger?  Jimmy, it was so bad, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  It was so bad, dude, that she literally turned my, my mom, my dad, my sister, uh, on me.  And the only one that ever stayed true was my brother.  Um, you know, that, that's all the support I've ever had.  And, and it, it's finally starting to come full circle to where my family, you know, sees what's going on.  And my dad had to have her evicted out of his house.  I mean, it, it was awful.  So she might be, she might not to cut you off, but she might be obviously a pain in the ass or a shitty whatever. 
[03:52:00]  But you did do something that, like, women, there's nothing going to upset a woman more than the guy finding a younger, hotter chick.  Um, and meanwhile, you've pumped out kids with this one.  And then you find a better version.  So, of course, and I'm not saying what she's doing is right, but don't be shocked that she's vindictive and awful.  Because that's the thing for women, like, our bodies don't go through when kids pop. 
[03:52:30]  We don't have to deal with that shit.  But once a woman pops out a couple of kids, they are, uh, they're no longer new and fresh.  So when, when the husband goes and finds somebody newer and fresher, you've already done something with her that she can never undo.  So no one will ever meet her.  You understand what I mean?  So I'm not saying that she's right to be a cunt, but you did do something that would drive any woman to be fucking horribly vindictive.  Right.  And how long ago did you guys split?  Man, it's been three years. 
[03:53:00]  And has she found anyone else?  Yeah, I mean, they're, you know, they're off and on all the time.  And my kids just view that as being, you know, the accepted, the norm, you know?  I mean, she, she literally went out and said on every dick she possibly could within that, you know, whatever, three years.  But, you know, there, there's nothing wrong with that in their eyes, you know?  Mom, mom does no wrong.  And, you know, dad's just a complete fuck up in life, you know?  Yeah.  Well, she's obviously bad-mouthing you to them. 
[03:53:30]  How much time do you spend with the kids?  I mean, I tried with my son for, you know, from, from the day I left.  I mean, I, you know, my daughter, she just completely went 100% with mom and, you know, just has nothing to do with me.  She started to come back, but, you know, she, the only, the only time she goes back when she needs money, that's it, man.  Well, you, you know, in their eyes, they don't, you know, they're young.  They don't understand the dynamics of a marriage or a sexual relationship or how, you know, you, whatever happens in a marriage.  So, you know, they always talk about how divorce fucks kids up. 
[03:54:00]  So they see you as the one who fucked it all up.  You're the one who left.  Again, when they get older, they'll understand more.  But right now, you're just the dickhead who left them in mom and now she's in this shitty back and forth with this other asshat.  So, of course, you're the fucking bad guy.  So you have to kind of, again, not having children and never having been this, I'm speculating, but just spend time with them and try to explain as best you can without totally trashing the ex-wife. 
[03:54:30]  And eventually they will, they'll see it.  And eventually they'll understand more.  But I think if they're young, it's probably really hard when all they see you as is the guy who left and now they're in this fucking broken home with this other shit dick running around, breaking up with her, dating her, breaking up with her.  Jimmy, as big of a douchebag as I am, I've never said one bad word about their mother.  That's smart.  That's smart.  What you might want to do is explain.  I know she trash talks me all the time, but I just, I try just to completely keep a level head, man. 
[03:55:00]  And just, you know, I focus my, my therapy is my work.  And I drive drunk and I just go all the time.  Just never stop.  Do you ever explain to the kids nicely why she bad mouths you?  Like maybe let them know, this is why your mother's so angry at me.  And maybe admit if you, if you've done anything that you could have handled better, maybe tell them you could have handled certain things better.  Like, and in a way, maybe you're telling, like without saying it, maybe you're addressing why they're mad at you too. 
[03:55:30]  But if you say, look, in a marriage, whatever you would say, if in a marriage, you know, people fall out of love or these things happen.  And maybe you explain that's why she's so mad at you.  So the next time she's shit talking you or motherfucking you, they'll have that little explanation in their head.  Right, right.  I gotcha.  Don't get too graphic though.  You know, daddy requires a finger in his backside and mother just didn't want to do it.  Don't get that fucking, don't be that honest with them.  Don't talk about how the new one sucks your fucking balls up through your helmet and mother couldn't do that. 
[03:56:00]  All right.  Thank you for the call, man.  Good luck.  Thanks, man.  I really appreciate it.  Sure, buddy.  Ron in Maryland used to have a much bigger cock.  What happened?  I think I know what it is too.  You're a black guy and you got vitiligo.  And the light of your skin just began shrinking.  What happened, Ron?  Hey, first of all, I want to say, hey, I saw you at the comedy show in Baltimore a couple weekends ago, man.  Great job.  Thank you for coming.  Thank you for taking a picture with me.  Thank you, buddy. 
[03:56:30]  Hey, you know what?  Yeah, like I'm 43 now.  And up until I was about 30, 31, I mean, hey, I'm an average looking dude, but I always prided myself.  I had like an eight, eight and a half inch cock, man.  It was pretty thick.  All of a sudden throughout my 30s, I mean, I still get hard.  But, you know, really hard, but it's only like seven inches.  You know, it's like, it's like, what happened?  Have you put weight on?  I have put some weight on.  How much?  I'm on about 25 pounds.  I used to use 200, now I'm two and a quarter. 
[03:57:00]  That might be a big part of it, dude.  Plus, I think as we get older, our erections aren't as good as they used to be.  So maybe there's some less, the combination of less blood rushing to your dick.  You're not diabetic or anything, are you?  Yeah, I'm sorry?  Are you diabetic?  No, no, no, not diabetic.  I have pretty high blood pressure, but I am medicated for it.  Are you allowed to take Viagra or Cialis?  Never asked my doctor yet.  To be honest, I was kind of embarrassed to ask.  Oh, God, don't be.  You're calling a radio show telling us that your dick is fucking shrinking like Lily Tomlin. 
[03:57:30]  Don't be embarrassed to ask.  Fuck, I would never be embarrassed to ask my doctor.  That's the first thing I'd say.  Hi, what's your name?  Jim Norton.  You got any cock pills, doc?  Fucking right.  Don't ever be embarrassed.  Fucking, the doctor, they don't care.  They look inside your asshole.  They look at your grimy toenails.  They fucking look in your dumb eyes and your ears.  Talk to him and tell him, look, my dick is not doing what it used to do.  He'll probably suggest that you lose some weight. 
[03:58:00]  See if you can lose the 25 pounds.  That's a good motivator.  Go to the gym.  Tighten up a little bit.  Get the body in a little better shape.  And then maybe the blood will flow a little better.  And then see if a Viagra or a Cialis helps.  And you might get a lot of that back.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Thanks, Jim.  All right.  Good luck.  What's more embarrassing?  You fucking cock shrinking or talking to some dumb quack?  What's more embarrassing is seeing a girl who used to fuck in high school.  What happened to it?  Just tell her you went through a divorce. 
[03:58:30]  Let's see here.  Ooh.  And let's try Randy.  Apparently very, very Randy.  That's me.  We'll get to Glenn afterwards.  Hmm.  Yes, Randy.  Yeah, man.  Anyway, I went through a divorce in October.  And anyway, we had split up and got back together before that, you know, a few different times.  We divorced. 
[03:59:00]  And now we're back together and trying to work things out again.  I had an affair.  One reason why I had the affair was I am not attracted to her at all whatsoever.  But this woman is a saint.  She does everything in the world for me.  I mean, she's taking care of me.  You know, when work got slow, stuff like that, you know, when I've been sick, you know.  Yeah.  And, you know, that's why I married her, you know. 
[03:59:30]  Were you ever really, were you ever that attracted to her?  Um, I'm, I'm kind of weird.  I think I have a sexual problem.  I'm kind of like one of those guys that like to see if I can fucking hit it.  Yeah.  You know, and then once I finally get it, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm kind of satisfied.  Then I'll fuck for a while and then I'll be done.  Yeah, you don't have a problem.  You're called being a male.  Believe me, I understand that.  Okay.  And we, um, anyway, we're, we're back together and we're trying to work things out. 
[04:00:00]  When I'm away, when we were divorced, I'd be coming over the road truck driver and I've  always been a local driver.  I was miserable without this woman.  And, and any other time I was away from her that we had gotten an argument, whatever,  split up, I was miserable without her.  See, here's the thing.  She, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Do what now?  She, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  She, she seems to me like she's a mommy and a maid and a caretaker, but because you  have this thing sexually where you like to fuck new girls, like every other man, you 
[04:00:30]  want, I hate to say it, you want your cake and you want to eat it.  We want to have the nice caretaking mommy who makes things better and who looks out for  us when we're sick and who does our whatever, but then we want to go out.  She does.  Yeah, of course.  And then we want to go out and fuck other girls.  So I guess in a marriage, the decision you have to make is, do I want to stay married  to this person who I'm not attracted to at all?  And either a continue to cheat or B just keep fucking the woman I'm not attracted to, or 
[04:01:00]  do I want to, uh, free us both and let her find a guy who will want to fuck her and not  cheat on her.  And you could find a woman who you want to fuck, but you may have to be a little more  independent and do shit yourself.  But it seems like you're going to have to reconcile those two things.  Right.  Um, and I've been trying to figure out ways to, to, to make myself, I mean, I can fucking  jack off and, and get a nut in five, 10 minutes.  What's the language?  Sometimes, sometimes quicker than that. 
[04:01:30]  I can get in bed with her, stick my dick in her and it'll, I won't, I can think of other  women, have all the other women going through my head and still won't.  What's the, what's the longest you go without jerking off?  How long?  Uh, maybe shit, man, two, three days.  So why don't you go a couple of weeks without it?  Sometimes I'll jack off, uh, fucking three times a day.  Yeah.  So that's like kind of addictive behavior.  So why don't you give yourself a couple of weeks off so this way, when you touch her  or when she touches you, it might feel a little better. 
[04:02:00]  Sometimes we just have to get rid of all the outside shit that we're doing.  And then you find yourself refocusing on the person like they become, when you, when you're  not looking at the person you're with as one of 200 options, like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know I got this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When you're looking them as them as the option, it might be easier to be turned on by her.  Thank you for the call, man.  All right.  Good luck here.  Thank you, Jim.  Be good, buddy.  Now let's see, uh, Glenn in the Bronx is, I'm a big fan of Jim, but he's all wrong about  coddling women. 
[04:02:30]  Yes, Glenn.  Well, that's how they take the call.  I guess the screener translates it to that.  Okay.  Yeah.  Not all wrong.  What I was saying, my point was some of the best advice I ever get on what's going  wrong under my roof are friends of mine, same age group, you know, late to late 30 that  never took the plunge.  And it's like, you sit there and you say to yourself, if you lived it, the rationale that  you're using, it'll go out the window only because, Jim, you'd have to be Jesus Christ 
[04:03:00]  himself.  Right.  And no, you're writing this check every month.  She's out all hours of the night.  You are sleeving.  You are sleeving at the job just to provide.  Right.  You're literally being told, F you, I'm going to, I'm going to not only walk on you, I'm  going to do it with heels and dance on you.  You're tossing and turning.  You don't, you're loyal.  You don't cheat.  She's out there.  She's saying this, that, and the other.  I'm not going to sit there and cater to you. 
[04:03:30]  I'm not your mother is a great line.  I'm not your mother.  Well, hold on.  Let me ask you a question.  How am I wrong about coddling women?  In what way am I saying that they should be coddled?  Because when you sit there and you say, swallow all that at the man, but turn around, explain  to the kids, although your mother F's me up and down.  Oh, here's why I said that.  And again, I, I, I've never been married, but what I've heard people who are married say  is you don't want to just poison the kids.  Yeah.  Like what I didn't say, tell the kids it's all your fault.  I said, explain some of the dynamics of what happens. 
[04:04:00]  Like, you know, people are stopped.  They fall out of love or whatever it is.  And then as they get older, cause they're young.  So what is he going to say?  Hey, your mom's a cunt.  Like that works for as adults, but like, I don't, I've never heard parents who are divorced  say that motherfucking each other to the kids is healthy.  What I've heard is if this guy wants a better relationship with his kids, he wants something.  So if you would talk to the kids and say, look, this is what happened. 
[04:04:30]  We weren't in love.  Here's what I was doing wrong.  Like kind of own your part of it.  You're in a way when the mother starts yelling at that, cause she's going to say that shit  when he's not there, the kids will remember, oh yeah, dad said this to us, but dad kind  of explained what this was.  It's almost like giving them an explanation.  So the next time she starts cunting you to them, they have some point of reference with  what you've said.  It takes a lot of strength to do it, my friend, because when you're being told the feedback  that, the feedback that comes to those same kids about you is not rational. 
[04:05:00]  It's not logical.  Of course not.  And I'm sure it's hard to believe me.  I'm sure it is, but I'm saying if you're a dad and you want to have a relationship with  the kids, it's, it's like, well, what are you going to, what's more important to you?  Like tit for tat and saying, fuck her.  She's a cunt who was out there while I was supporting or figuring out a way to get the  relationship with the kids.  Like, I'm not saying that he was wrong to leave her, but what he did, like, look, when 
[04:05:30]  you leave a woman for someone, I don't care what it is, that fucks a woman up.  I'm not saying he was wrong to leave, but like in a woman's eyes, that's the worst thing  you can do.  You know what?  Some of us make the decision where you look, let's say you have two kids right now, hypothetically  speaking, not talking about anybody in particular, especially not Glenn and LeBron.  Let's say hypothetically speaking, there's a kid that's 11, there's a kid that's nine,  and you both pretty much, without saying the words, you both pretty much said, we're  going to go down this road, accept misery, and then re-evaluate when they're in their 
[04:06:00]  20s.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  And I think that the other percentage that don't make that decision have not made it in  marriage.  The ones that have made it in marriage either made that decision or somehow found an answer,  you know?  Yep.  But the difference is, and again, I'm not saying that, I don't know the dynamics of  that guy's marriage, or of any marriage, but I do know that the important thing to that  guy was that his kids and him have a relationship. 
[04:06:30]  Of course.  Now, if they were 25 years old, you sit down and you have a discussion with them, but they  were a lot younger, like the ages you're kind of talking about.  So, whatever is the important thing, is it, if you just motherfuck the mother, the one  that they've sided with, they've went with her, so obviously they're mad at you too.  So, if you just sit there and motherfuck her, aren't they going to get madder at you and  get closer to her?  Like, sometimes you've got to use psychology.  Absolutely.  If your point was to disguise it and mask it and try to be rational for the kid's sake, 
[04:07:00]  I agree 100%.  I thought maybe I caught the tail end, but I thought you were saying, swallow, swallow,  swallow, no matter what you throw in your way, continue to be rational, and it's hard.  No, no, but be rational.  I'm talking about his relationship with the kids.  I don't care what kind of relationship he has with her.  He was talking, I was saying, talk about what you've done wrong to them.  I don't know if he'll ever talk to that woman again, but he has to be tied to her, so you  might as well make it somewhat nice, because she's controlling the kids right now. 
[04:07:30]  So, again, you're right, though, man.  I've never been married, and I always preface these things with that, saying, look, this  is just an opinion.  I don't have an experience.  Like, I can talk about sex addiction or these other things because I experience them.  I can't talk about this from experience, so I just, I'm guessing that's what anybody's  doing when we're not married.  I've got to run, man, but thank you for the call, Glenn, all right?  Yep.  Take care, guys.  One more read.  We were a little shorter today because we had the Vinny and Uncle Nino and his mom came  in.  Mother's Day is coming up.
