<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a self-deprecating introduction highlighting the hosts' self-destructive tendencies.  The show featured Opie, Anthony, and John Norton.  They immediately launched into a discussion of pictures from their phones, displayed on an Apple TV. This included a photo of listener Roland with his pants slightly down, prompting speculation about his physique and weight loss.  A picture of comedian Bobby Kelly, showing him significantly heavier than usual, led to a discussion about his recent eating habits, including a detailed account of a large meal at Opie's house.  Bobby Kelly's new, eyebrowless Twitter avatar was deemed "creepy."

The hosts then discussed their day off, allergies (including a humorous anecdote about Anthony's encounter with a fame-obsessed allergist), and the high cost of prescription drugs. Opie recounted a high-speed driving incident, showing GoPro footage.  Their Easter celebrations were detailed, comparing their differing family traditions regarding egg and basket hiding, and reminiscing about past egg-dyeing mishaps, including one involving Opie's son.  This led to a discussion about various foods, including ham, Brussels sprouts, and beets, culminating in a graphic comparison of which would be preferable to consume in a starvation scenario: Brussels sprouts or human buttocks.

The conversation turned to *Game of Thrones*' sex scenes, described in graphic detail, followed by a discussion of The Masters golf tournament, including Phil Mickelson's performance, a remarkable shot by a golfer whose name they struggled to pronounce, and the rules concerning lost golf balls.  The show concluded its first major segment with a debate about the exclusion of women from the Masters, expressing potentially controversial views on the topic and men's desire for male-only spaces.  One host recounted an uncomfortable experience at a nail salon surrounded by women discussing men.

A later segment began with a discussion of golf putting techniques, using manhole covers and pinholes for visualization.  The conversation shifted to Bubba Watson, his pink driver, his General Lee car, and the Confederate flag.  The Mets and Yankees' early season performance and a proposal to shorten the baseball season to 80 games were briefly discussed. A caller's video of a golden retriever rescuing a puppy from a pool was described, leading to a discussion of viral videos and a CNN reporter's makeup and gender identity.

The death of Mike Wallace prompted a discussion of his career and a 1967 CBS News report on homosexuality, excerpts of which were played later.  A CNN reporter's use of a racial slur was mentioned, followed by a discussion of NBC Sports adding artificial bird sounds to their golf broadcasts.  A lengthy rant about manipulative World Hunger commercials ensued, suggesting sending U-Hauls instead of food to starving people in deserts.  The 20th anniversary of Sam Kinison's death triggered a discussion about favorite comedians (Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Bill Hicks, Sam Kinison), and the driver who killed Kinison bragging about it.  Excerpts from the Mike Wallace report and a 1950s anti-homosexual PSA ("Boys Beware") were played, containing graphic depictions of sexual assault and offensive racial slurs.  The hosts discussed societal views on homosexuality, upcoming guests, and promoted other show segments.

Another segment covered frustrations with fans using their usernames on online services, especially Instagram.  The hosts discussed Bob Kelly's Instagram usage. A viral video depicting a violent assault and robbery in Baltimore sparked a heated debate about media bias and racial inequality in reporting, with the hosts using offensive language to describe both perpetrators and the media's response.  Audio clips of news reports and statements from the New Black Panthers were played, containing highly offensive and explicitly racial rhetoric.  The conversation moved to Kodak's bankruptcy, contrasted with Instagram's success, and outrage over Kodak executives' bonuses.  The hosts speculated about Rochester, New York's future.  A personal anecdote about one host's mother hiding Easter baskets for her adult children led to a humorous exchange about family dynamics and fantasies involving a future wife and a shared pool.  A wrestling match between Brock Lesnar and John Cena, focusing on a possibly accidental punch, and several celebrity guests calling in were mentioned.  Chris Elliott was a guest in studio.

Chris Elliott's segment covered his experiences on late-night shows (especially David Letterman's), eating unpleasant foods on television, "meat sweats," dietary regimens, airline food, and Twitter.  He discussed his show *Eagle Heart* on Adult Swim, comparing its format to older television styles, his film career (including *Cabin Boy*), and his reactions to critical reviews. The hosts and Elliott shared anecdotes about their experiences in the entertainment industry.  A significant portion focused on the "Buffett Rule," followed by a debate on desserts, particularly flan.  The final moments involved logistical issues regarding upcoming appearances and scheduling conflicts.

The final segment consisted primarily of listener calls responding to "What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?", generating numerous tangents.  Upcoming live shows in Cleveland and a Memorial Day party at Anthony's compound were discussed. The hosts discussed their lack of social interaction outside of work, attributing it to the show's schedule and workplace dynamics. A conflict between staff members Paul and E-Rock, involving accusations of Paul withholding audio clips, was detailed.  Sexually explicit comments from a caller about Anthony's girlfriend and a caller using a racial slur were included.  An incident involving Bobo being nude in Anthony's pool after a party, with details about his underwear being cut off, was recounted.  A Cleveland tourism video was mentioned and partially played.  The segment ended with discussions of an upcoming show and ongoing team dynamics. No guests were in studio during this segment.

[00:02:30]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:03:00]  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans. 
[00:03:30]  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  John Norton, a comedian.  The three men make up the positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the O.P. and Anthony show.  Anthony show, a popular radio show.  I am known for a program known for a program known for the cream style of entertainment and having  very few minutes.  Oh, my God.  No, this is getting really intense. 
[00:04:00]  It's funny.  It's funny.  It's funny.  It's funny.  It's funny.  It's funny.  It's funny.  It's funny.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You're the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, you're 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people.  Real excitement.  Hey, let's go fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:04:30]  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Well, let's do that.  Good morning, everybody.  Of course, fucksotic, man.  Yes.  We've got the show on the road.  Hi.  We're just looking at pictures from everybody's phones, and for some reason, Roland's picture  is still up on the screen.  Yeah, Roland's picture came up.  Roland's crack.  It's his ass.  Ass crack.  He's got his hands on his pants like he's pulling them up, but his ass is hanging out.  And we were noticing he's got a relatively thin ass. 
[00:05:00]  And I was wondering if he's one of those guys with the skinny legs and ass, but then  the, you know, kind of rotund rest of the body.  I think so.  He's trying to lose weight with some new program, and he's miserable.  We'll have to get an update today.  I'll tell you, though, this Apple TV.  Oh, God damn, Dan.  Jesus.  That's a pot roast in the toilet bowl.  Apple TV is pretty cool.  We're all here with our various phones and whatnot, and we could just pop up our pictures up there.  But how, aren't you very cognizant of what pictures you're hitting? 
[00:05:30]  You're nervously making sure it's the right picture?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, because it could go awry.  I'm showing these guys something right before the, oh, is this on?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is this on?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Stupid fun.  Anyway, so I'm showing these guys something right before the show.  So, and I had to make sure that instead of just flicking back and forth, I had to make  sure to go back to my camera roll.  Right, right.  Just to make sure there wasn't like an errant dick picture.  You can't, yeah, you can't just scroll through the pictures.  Let's see the good shit. 
[00:06:00]  Russian roulette.  Let's see the good shit.  Play some Russian roulette.  Play Russian roulette.  I think I'm pretty safe these days.  Just spin that fucking.  Spin the wheel.  Spin that gallery and hit one up there.  Let's see what we got.  Oh, boy.  This all started because, what, we have Hawaiian punch on the desk?  Hawaiian.  Hawaiian.  I don't know what it was.  Yeah, it's gone now.  There's some kind of spill in the back office yesterday.  A weird Hawaiian punch.  I guess I'm finding out that other guys use your offices.  We're finding that out, too.  When we're not here.  Offices.  Offices. 
[00:06:30]  I guess so.  I mean, I know if I was here on the weekend and I was just rummaging through someone else's  office and stuff, something about that tells me I would get in trouble.  But apparently it's perfectly fine for everybody else.  Gary's going to get a talking to today.  Talking to.  He's going to get a talking to.  Where the hell is Virgil in this picture, by the way?  I'm so sorry to interrupt things.  Huh?  Parking lot.  Yeah, Sam put up a Virgil picture.  Yeah, there's a Virgil picture where he's just alone in a parking lot or something.  Yeah.  But, like, is there anything going on?  Or was that an event?  What is this?  Probably a convention because he brings his shit. 
[00:07:00]  But I got to be the stupid one.  Is that a Photoshop?  Nope.  It really isn't.  So he's just in a parking lot by himself?  Yep.  Yeah.  Holy...  Nah, come on.  That's pretty fucked up, isn't it?  That looks like it was Photoshopped from a signing.  But all right.  All right.  There's a...  Oh, that picture.  This picture got a lot over the weekend.  It's a picture...  Bobby Kelly...  Yeah, Bobby Kelly and Jimmy came over to my house over the weekend, and I took this picture 
[00:07:30]  of the two of them by the little kitchen island, and boy, did Bobby take some shit for literally  for over 24 hours.  It was the most commented, like, picture that I posted.  Right.  And because Bobby is very, very heavy, and people noticed it.  I felt bad after I put it up because I didn't think about it because I...  Like, I see Bobby.  I know Bobby, so I just put the picture up.  But a lot of people, I guess, have not seen Bobby of late.  Does he look that big?  Yes. 
[00:08:00]  And I also...  So it's not a fucked up angle or a picture?  Then he's getting some weight.  What's going on with him, man?  He has.  He's got to keep his shit together.  Well, let me tell you about that.  He literally ate me out of house and home.  No.  So he's not even trying?  I didn't really have...  Like, I didn't have, like, a lot of stuff like I usually do when there's parties.  Right, right.  But I had some shit around the house.  But he found some shit to eat.  He wound up eating.  He had a few...  He started with, like, chips and salsa, which is, you know, fine. 
[00:08:30]  Sure.  But then he found some cheese in the fridge and made nachos.  And then he grabbed the roast beef and cheese and some tortillas and pickles and just started  making rolls, like burritos.  Then he started eating...  Oh, then he started eating pork ribs that I had in there.  And then he needed dessert.  Right.  And he didn't like the chocolate mousse.  So he went for some other... 
[00:09:00]  Like, Keith the cop was just walking around the house, opening the fridge, trying to find him shit.  Why was he so hungry?  I don't know.  This isn't helping.  No.  No.  Because he doesn't like when we talk about his weight.  I know.  He doesn't like when the listeners talk about his weight.  But we're worried about him.  There should have been an intervention at that point.  He's a bit bigger than the last time I saw him.  Yeah.  And his new, what, avatar is him without eyebrows?  Yeah, that's his Twitter avatar.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  He erased his eyebrows and...  That doesn't even look like him. 
[00:09:30]  Did he fuck up his teeth, too, a little bit?  Yeah.  That doesn't even look like him.  That's creepy.  Go to his...  Eyebrows are important.  Go to his Twitter if you want to see his new avatar.  Yeah, you realize eyebrows are important.  Yeah.  You're right.  It just kind of takes the emotion out of your face.  It really puts the whole face together.  Yeah, it really does.  It's like brackets for your face.  Because if you think about it, if you think about it, it's just eyebrows.  You figure, you know, if you shave your goatee or your mustache or your beard, it doesn't drastically, you know, kill you. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  Like, taking your eyebrows out.  Let's all go with pictures without eyebrows.  We'll Photoshop all our eyebrows out and see what we all look like.  Yeah, that's weird.  Everyone enjoy their day off.  Oh, it's fucking nice.  Yeah.  Damn, give it a sleep.  Yeah, it was awesome.  Well, that's fantastic.  It was really nice, wasn't it?  It certainly was.  I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed it, too.  Sleep till noon.  Until the allergies hit.  Oh, allergics?  You got to give me a minute on my allergies. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, man.  Every year, same time.  Yeah.  This is a bad time.  How the fuck do you take care of that shit?  And then with all the wind we had yesterday, just blowing all that shit around.  Oh, boy.  It was blowing the shit around.  So I enjoyed half my day off.  And then the second half was, like, dealing with allergies.  And I got an old Jewish allergist who was, like, a fame whore.  Yeah.  I don't even give a...  I swear to you...  A fame whore.  I don't really give a fuck. 
[00:11:00]  Like, I forget that, like, we have some fame sometimes.  Yeah.  So he asked me what I do, and I guess I told him.  I usually don't.  And now the guy's more concerned about asking about the radio show, asking who we talk to,  this and that.  And I'm like, how about you deal with my allergies?  Yeah, I'm here for...  Yeah, this is business.  So I go, hey, how about the allergies?  You know, the reason why I'm here?  And he goes, oh, yeah.  And he just throws samples at me.  But the problem with samples and medication, you got to know how to take it. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  Yeah.  So he throws all this shit at me, and I'm like, none of it's working.  So I finally called Dr. Steve to put me on a program, basically.  A program?  I had to list all the stuff that this dumb allergist who, you know, cared way more about  who we've talked to and all the stunts we've done in the past.  Because he's one of those guys, he's heard of us, but he hasn't heard the show.  Right.  So he's got to ask you about everything he's heard about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've come across those, right?  Oh, yeah.  So I was like, oh, that sex in the church thing and the time with the boss and Clinton. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm sneezing my balls off right in front of him.  So Dr. Steve put it all together for me, hopefully.  So I feel way better.  He is the man.  But I had to get two prescriptions filled.  Yeah.  And I don't care how much fucking money you make in this world.  It's infuriating.  I walk up to get my prescriptions.  It's two.  I'll even tell you, it's for singular.  Yeah.  And it's for an allergy medication called Zizol.  That's pretty good. 
[00:12:30]  It works for me.  Oh.  Valtrex?  And Valtrex.  I threw a little Valtrex in there.  Look at this pill.  Look how tiny this thing is.  Oh, that's adorable.  Is that the tiniest fucking pill you've ever seen?  That's the Zizol, right?  Yeah.  These two lousy pills.  Yeah.  $190 copay.  That's with insurance, eh?  I go, I have insurance.  No, I know.  That's the copay.  $190.  Well.  For two medications.  For allergies.  Yeah, that's fucking crazy. 
[00:13:00]  Bullshit.  Occasionally, you run into a prescription you've got to take that isn't covered or something.  And it's like, oh, yes.  That's $650.  Oh, I know.  What?  I don't even know what it would have been without the insurance.  I would assume it has to be at least three times that, right?  Yeah.  It would have probably been close to $600.  Probably, yeah.  Fuck.  Those convenience drugs, they really nail you on, especially the insurance companies.  Things that they don't deem, you know, necessary.  Yeah.  And allergy things are probably like, well, you either get a stuffy nose or you, you know, 
[00:13:30]  or you pay through the fucking nose.  It's kind of necessary.  Yeah.  They don't deem it that, I guess.  It's kind of necessary.  It affects a lot of us.  Yeah.  And then you got the dumb wind blowing around, blowing up all those allergens.  Yes, very windy.  All those allergens.  So how was the Easter?  You know, your basic family little get together.  Yeah.  Get together.  Um, yeah, that's about it, though.  Nothing, there wasn't anything, nothing of note.  Did you get an Easter basket? 
[00:14:00]  Nothing of note.  No, I didn't get an Easter bastard.  No.  No.  I got to take the car out, though, which was fun.  I got on a nice day, just fucking whizzing down the expressway looking for police officers.  How fast?  How fast will you admit?  120.  Is that the?  120.  120 on a good stretch.  Or is that the speed you'll admit today?  No, that was the real speed.  Nice.  That was it.  About 120.  That's going to give Jimmy a heart attack.  No.  Yeah.  I put a couple of clips up on YouTube and shit.  Yeah, I saw the one. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  You look like a fucking lunatic.  I'm looking at the camera.  I know.  That GoPro works really well for catching a lot of real estate on the lens.  Yeah.  Because I was able to actually get the entire front seat and out of the fucking, uh, I think  it sounds great.  I love the new GoPro because the old one, the audio sucked on it.  What road is that?  That's, uh, 112. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, okay.  Right.  The port shaft.  Oh, so you got the cars coming right at you?  Yeah, I know.  You're crazy.  Well, that's just there.  That's why I didn't really tear it up.  And people are like, why were you shifting so fast?  You went from first to second too fast.  You got to let that thing scream.  I'm like, really?  If you look, I'm turning.  I'm fucking making a turn.  I'm supposed to tack out first while I'm turning.  I would end up spinning around eight times and hitting a guardrail.  Like, you know, it happened once.  The picky Pete's out there are just exhausted. 
[00:15:30]  Everything.  Everything.  You post.  They got to fucking.  Everything.  They know better.  They did it better.  They fucking.  Everything's better, better, better than you.  Everything.  I know.  I got to try a Kennelli shot.  What's a Kennelli shot?  What the hell is that?  It's like some kind of like, I don't know, Irish thing.  It's called Kennelli.  Great for allergies.  Really?  Yeah.  I guess you'd get a shot of Kennelli.  K-E-N-N-E-L-L-Y.  Yeah.  No, I feel good today.  Fuck it.  I felt good for most of the day. 
[00:16:00]  Yes, I feel good.  I got in a little trouble with the Easter thing because of tradition.  What happened?  What was the first year with the kid where you had him like make Easter something because  he's becoming aware.  Oh, yeah.  He's becoming aware.  He said, we are.  So my wife put together the Easter baskets and the eggs and she left it all out nice  on it in a really nice display in the living room.  So I woke up early and I assumed my job was to hide everything. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, no.  But I guess you got to talk that shit out.  What?  Because tradition in my family, we hid all the Easter baskets.  Right.  Because I'm one of seven kids.  So we hid the Easter baskets all over the fucking house.  And then you ran around trying to find your Easter basket.  If you found someone else's because they all had names on it, you let it be.  Oh.  And then you kept running around trying to find yours.  But I guess in her household, the Easter baskets were on display nice.  Like Christmas when you come running down the stairs and you see all the presents.  Oh, no.  Well, you come running down the stairs and there's the Easter baskets. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, boy.  You still hadn't discussed that at some point.  So she was a bit perturbed.  A bit miffed.  Yeah, because it was all set up nice.  She goes, where the hell?  And the kid comes running out and she's all excited with the camera.  Like, what?  Where the fuck did that?  I'm like, what?  He had to find all this shit.  Anyone.  And you know what it is?  Anyone else's family tradition is stupid.  Like, unless it's yours.  It's like, no, you do it this way.  What the fuck are you talking about, you weirdos? 
[00:17:30]  That's what I said.  I'm like, that's stupid.  You hide the Easter baskets.  She goes, no, you hide just the eggs.  I'm like, no, our house hid everything.  Oh, well, so you know what?  We hid just the eggs and stuff.  Yeah, yeah, we hid the eggs.  So you kept the Easter baskets out on display.  Yeah, the baskets were out.  You hid the eggs and then they grabbed their little basket.  Well, we grabbed our little baskets.  And then you'd search around, pick up an egg and put it in your little basket.  Because your Easter baskets fill with candy already.  Why would you want eggs at that point?  Well, because the eggs are like the, you know, the thing.  That's like the thing. 
[00:18:00]  But it's not the thing.  It's the thing for the parents.  Easter egg hunt.  Easter egg hunt.  Dumb.  You know, and then once you find the one basket, it's over.  That kind of blows because you got to keep going around.  Like you find one egg, you look for another one.  You're like, oh, how many are left?  You know, the one Easter basket.  Once you find it, game over.  Are you really looking for eggs after a while when you see all the treats in your Easter basket?  You got those peeps staring at you?  Well, you eat the treats while you're looking for the eggs.  But what are the eggs?  The eggs, you eat them later.  No one eats the eggs.  No?  You eat one and then you realize that hard-boiled eggs suck and you throw the rest of them out. 
[00:18:30]  I like the ones that would crack.  No one eats hard-boiled eggs unless it's Easter.  The ones that would crack.  Yeah.  And then the dye would get in there and you got this mutant fucking blue-green egg.  You ate it though, right?  It's terrible.  Of course.  We always ate those too.  I liked hard-boiled eggs with like a fuckload of salt on them and shit like that.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  But you're not going to eat them all year long?  No.  I occasionally like a hard-boiled egg.  I like...  I used to like soft-boiled egg as a kid.  Yeah.  Like nice and snotty.  Those are good.  You just mix it up and put a lot of salt and pepper on it.  My grandma knew how to make that shit. 
[00:19:00]  But it is a fine line.  You got to fucking time that perfectly or it's too raw.  It's disgusting.  Or then if it congealed too much, it sucked.  Well, we went all in because we dyed the eggs the night before.  Wow.  I told my wife I haven't dyed Easter eggs probably since she's been born.  To be honest with you.  Yeah, yeah.  It's been a while.  Because I put...  I go...  It's got to be...  It must have been...  I don't know.  I think it's been 20 years. 
[00:19:30]  She goes, it has to be longer than that.  I'm like, all right.  Might be.  How about you give me a few years here?  Is it the same fucking getup?  It's the exact same shit.  Is it that little wire thing that you put the egg in and you dip it in the color?  They haven't improved on that.  So, like everyone else, you just fucking use your fingers after a while.  No one's holding their egg on that little wiry thing.  That little wire thing.  And then...  They haven't improved on that whatsoever.  But now, how do you actually make the dye?  You remember.  I remember the old days when you used it. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  And one little tablet.  It's the same shit.  It hasn't changed in all these years.  But I remember...  I think they've come up with a couple more colors.  That's about it.  I remember having to boil the shit.  Do you remember literally having to put it on the stove and boil it and then put the dye in?  Wow.  And it had to boil for fucking...  Are you sure?  Yeah.  I kind of remember that.  I don't know.  You might be wrong for once.  I don't know.  I don't remember that.  I remember the old kits.  Really?  Yeah.  See, we did that.  Yes.  Boiled?  I think so. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  Am I an idiot, people?  Well, okay.  It's a trick question.  You know what's funny?  I...  Yeah, you smell...  That's right.  It was the awful vinegar smell permeated the house when you'd boil it.  You really had to boil it?  You had to boil it to make the dye fucking dissolve because they didn't have dye that just dissolved in this shit.  I shouldn't have questioned you.  Wow, man.  I don't remember the boiling.  I remember the distinct smell of vinegar because it would get on everything.  Yeah, yeah.  But I...  Oh, E-Rock's got something.  Yes, E-Rock.  Yeah, you'd boil it and the thing to hold the egg that they would give you was pure metal 
[00:21:00]  so you'd burn your hand from the boiling water.  I can't remember that.  Fuck.  I can't remember that shit.  It looked like a bubble wand almost.  Yeah, yeah, that thing.  But it was metal, so as soon as you put it into the boiling water, you were burning your  hand.  But wasn't it vinegar you had to boil?  You mixed the vinegar in with the boiling water.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  It was terrible.  Wait, did I fuck up?  Yeah.  Are you...  You still have to boil it?  I think so.  I thought you just popped the dye in fucking water or something.  No, it was like three tablespoons of vinegar, one little dye pellet, and we were off and 
[00:21:30]  running.  I guess the vinegar makes the shell softer.  It kind of, like...  This is how retarded I am, though.  I'm like...  Some dye takes.  We have to get hard-boiled eggs.  I forgot how to...  I forgot how to do it.  How do you do it?  Don't laugh at me.  Go ahead.  Don't look down.  How do you do it?  You put eggs in water, and you boil the motherfucking things.  You don't boil the water first like I did?  No, you kind of just put it in there, you turn the water up.  I had what looked like egg drop soup.  Oh, you did?  I fucking cracked all my eggs. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  See, because it'll start rolling.  The rolling boil, when you put the eggs in, you can't really do that.  Oh, yeah.  So they all cracked, and then that egg white shit was fucking flying everywhere.  Oh, yeah.  Turning my water into, like, I don't know, water cum.  That is sick when the fucking egg breaks, and that shit comes out, and then cooks.  Instantly boils and cooks, whatever.  Oh, it looks horrible.  So I don't even know how to boil water.  Yeah, you got to put them in, like, gently when the water's cold, and then turn the water  Well, there's a YouTube video for everything, so I learned that's the way to do it. 
[00:22:30]  There really are fucking just amazing tutorials for every fucking thing you can think of.  If somebody doesn't know how to do anything in this day and age, and then just doesn't  do it because they don't know, they're dumb.  Because you could just pop online and get eight different versions of how to do something  in fucking two minutes.  What's your candy of choice?  Did you indulge with the Easter candy?  No, I really didn't.  You're not a candy guy.  No, I'm really not.  It's my weakness. 
[00:23:00]  I need a little piece of chocolate every day.  Oh.  Like a grandma.  Where's my little piece of chocolate?  Chocolate?  It stimulates the same senses in the brain that sex does.  Oh, boy.  I don't like saying it.  And I should have a turgid heart on constantly.  Oh, God.  Turgid.  You realize peeps suck after about a sleep.  I had one peep.  You had one?  I had one peep and then knew not to have another one unless I wanted to fucking have a sugar 
[00:23:30]  rush where I couldn't make a fist for a week.  Yeah.  It's all about the peanut butter with me, man.  Oh, no.  I hate peanut butter.  Now they got the fucking chocolate bunnies with the fucking peanut butter.  Did you indulge?  With the peanut butter.  Jimmy has a lamb from L.A.  Hi, Norton.  Hi, guys.  No, I did not.  We're talking about Easter because we took yesterday off.  Yeah, I had no chocolate.  I ate a little more than I probably should have on the plane coming home, but no, it was  okay.  Yeah.  Targeting your way to eat right, it's fucking really hard.  It's impossible, right?  It must be, yeah.  I'm trying to add, like, what is a salad with fucking sugar pecans? 
[00:24:00]  How do you add?  Just throw the pecans away.  I had a couple.  Pecans.  They're good, though, in a salad.  Beet salad?  Beets are fucking hideous.  Beets.  Salad?  Yeah, beets are like...  You can enjoy yourself eating, you know, Jimmy.  They're like eating fucking human heels.  Beets are terrible.  Human heels.  I tried, uh...  I tried...  I tried Brussels sprouts at my Easter dinner.  Yeah.  Nope, still hate them.  Really?  Everyone keeps telling me how great and delicious they are. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, you gotta try these.  We roast them here.  Did you put a lot of lemon juice on them?  I tried everything, man.  They're like mini, mini cabbage.  They're very earthy tasting, aren't they?  You like them?  Well, people seem to like this Brussels sprouts shit.  I don't dislike them.  Put it that way.  That's what I said.  Yeah, yeah.  I ate one.  I'm like, look, I'm not gonna, like, fucking puke or, like...  Yeah.  But I didn't like it.  If I was starving, and it was the only thing standing in the way of starvation...  Oh, no, I wouldn't eat it.  I wouldn't eat it if I was starving.  No, you'd just starve? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, fuck it.  Start eating people, like, in alive?  Yeah.  It's like you have Brussels sprouts or your fucking teammates?  What do you take a...  I would take a piece of ass meat before Brussels sprouts.  The last meat?  To stay alive, yeah.  A little fucking slice of ass meat?  I really think I would do that.  If it was a big bowl of Brussels sprouts or a nice fucking slice of...  Swath of ass?  Of human ass?  Of human ass?  I think I'd go human ass.  How about if it was Roland's?  Oh, God.  We just saw Roland's ass.  We saw Roland's ass.  It's not as bad as you think.  On the TV.  So you fell? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Harry?  It wasn't bad.  Well, it was slender.  We were surprised it was his.  A lot more slender than we had thought, which is odd, but...  A lot of crack.  Yeah.  We think he's one of those skinny fat guys.  Like, he's obviously supposed to be really, really, like...  Yeah, the bottom end is...  Smaller than he is.  Skinnier.  His legs and ass.  Wasn't bad.  And then he's got, like, the rotund upper body.  See, it wasn't bad.  Yeah, that's Roland's ass right there.  From when?  Like, recently.  Recently.  Yeah.  He does lose weight, though.  Okay.  But if that arm was not in the way, his left arm, we would see, like, the gut. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  So he's strategically positioned.  Yeah.  And that fucking bullied me.  You can't really see the hair.  That's a horror show back there.  A lot of hair.  Yeah, because look how blurry it is.  That's, like, softening up his ass hair.  After a bus ride back from the Meadowlands.  Oh.  After three hours to see him, Bruce.  Oh, God.  He's all excited.  By the way, a lot of people saying, you know, just running around your house looking for  eggs is just a waste.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Because there's nothing... 
[00:26:30]  No one wants an egg.  Who cares?  But for the kids...  You already saw the eggs the night before because you dyed the dumb things.  But the Easter Bunny hides them.  You leave them out, the Easter Bunny hides the eggs.  Yeah, but the new way to do it, and this is what we did as well,  you get the plastic eggs with a little treat inside.  So at least if they find a dumb egg, they open up the plastic egg and there's something  inside.  Has it really come to plastic?  Yes, it has.  I mean, you know.  Yes, it has.  It's all about the plastic eggs with some real ones thrown in.  And then I...  And we... 
[00:27:00]  Remember, I broke all my eggs, so I didn't feel like going to the supermarket.  I'm a lazy father.  Oh, no.  So we only dyed eight eggs.  Eight eggs.  Instead of two dozen.  Should be two...  Yeah, two cartons of eggs, usually.  I was like...  And one of them was cracked, but I saved it.  I'm like, I'm not going back down to the store.  Did you do any fun decorating of the eggs, or was it just basic, here's a red one, here's  a blue one?  We made some Yo Gabba eggs.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  You ever see what you do...  We made them into the Yo Gabba characters, which you probably don't know. 
[00:27:30]  Do you know Muno?  I've heard about Yo Gabba.  I've heard about it.  Fufa.  You know Fufa.  From my brother.  Oh, really?  Bros into Yo Gabba Gabba.  Well, he does have a, you know, two and a half year old.  Yeah, we did that.  Oh, there you go.  We did that.  We made fucking Yo Gabba eggs.  How did you make them?  Did you have a...  Oh, shit, really? 
[00:28:00]  My kid still has...  He's died?  He's died.  Wow.  So, yeah, because sometimes you can do things with that wax pencil.  They'd give you that wax little crayon with the kit, and if you draw on it, the dye won't  attach to the wax.  Oh, I forgot about that.  So you're able to kind of put the dye where you want it and...  I got a shitty kit, because I don't think I got the wax pencil either.  You didn't get the wax pencil thingy either?  Fuck, I forgot about that.  Then what about the little paper kind of insert tab A in slot B, and you make a little hat for  the egg, a little pirate hat for the egg or something? 
[00:28:30]  The right side of ours, Stan, because I fucked that up, too, was collapsed.  I fucked that up.  It was collapsed.  You're terrible.  I told you I haven't done this in decades.  That's true, yeah.  I forgot.  Been a while, huh?  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  I forgot.  It worked out, though.  I used to do the half and half egg, too, where you'd take the little metal wand thingy  that holds the egg, and you'd do half of it, and then you'd take it out, and then you'd  turn it upside down, and do the other half in another color, and you're like, yeah, multi-color 
[00:29:00]  egg, bitches.  Well, because...  I'm a whole gangsta with my Easter egg.  Because my son doesn't understand shit, your son.  He's got to start understanding some shit.  Yeah?  He decided to drop all the eggs in every single dye, and then that was boring for him, so  then he took each dye and poured them into one, so all our eggs are brown.  I could have bought brown eggs.  That would make me insane.  Would it?  Yeah.  I didn't care.  Something like that.  I'd be like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 
[00:29:30]  I'd be crazy.  No matter who you are, you do have a tiny bit of that child still in you, so you're right.  I had one egg where I'm like, no, I want to just make something cool.  Yeah.  So you're kind of right, but the rest of them are like, yeah, whatever.  It's like, why are you mixing the dye?  Why are you...  You don't do that!  What are you doing?  I said, the kid would be like, ah!  He's just screaming at him.  He's mixing colors and...  Maybe because that's how I was...  Oh, my God.  I think I was raised like that.  And then he poured the dye in.  You don't put them together, asshole.  Then we had cups with paint.  We had cups with paint.  And he's putting the dye in the paint cups, too. 
[00:30:00]  Paint?  It was just a mess.  What kind of paint do you use on eggs?  Lead-based fucking Chinese paint?  Well, they had...  I think we had one paint that, I don't know, came with a kid or...  Oh, so you take the little brush detail?  That paint sucks, so that's why we broke out the real paint.  And that's why that shit is everywhere.  Get a fucking roller, paint each other up, paint our eggs, right?  I don't like your real...  Mike, what do you say, Bill?  Paint each other up.  I had a real Easter.  It was weird.  That is.  That's probably...  Hiding shit, dying eggs, having some of that ham that we only eat on Easter. 
[00:30:30]  Ham sucks.  Long time.  I love ham.  You don't like ham?  Do you eat ham when it's not a holiday?  I feel too bad for the little pigs.  That means it sucks.  Like holiday ham.  I like your sliced, cold-cut ham, you know, on a nice roll.  And I know that the in-laws are probably listening.  They listen every morning.  I like the ham.  I just don't eat ham.  There's a reason we don't eat ham all the time.  It's not that good, I guess.  I don't know.  It's a tradition to have a nice holiday ham, right?  You don't like a good holiday ham with the pineapples and cloves? 
[00:31:00]  Oh, pineapples and ham are good.  Yeah.  Not the cloves.  You don't eat the cloves.  No, no, you don't eat the cloves.  Oh, some brown sugar on top.  Yeah.  Really?  Fuck, yeah.  You'd love some ham right now.  Let's get some ham.  A glazed ham.  It's all right.  It is good shit.  But I try not to eat as much pork because I feel so bad for the pigs.  Aw.  They're really cute with their little feet that can't walk on linoleum.  Yeah.  They're really smart, too.  They're walking on linoleum.  They are.  Turns out pigs are really smart. 
[00:31:30]  They understand when you're killing them.  Yeah.  Most animals are just stupid.  They don't understand shit.  But a pig does.  A pig understands.  Let me tell you something I saw when I was 12.  Oh, boy.  I was over at a barbecue at Jimmy Jackson's Ranch.  Oh, no.  Don't tell me.  Good old Jimmy Jackson's Ranch over there in San Juan Capistrano, California, right off  the Ortega Highway, for those of you who are local to the area.  And it was a barbecue.  And, of course, there was going to be a big pit barbecue with some pork.  Oh, God. 
[00:32:00]  Did he cook it like you cook a lobster?  Well, Jimmy had a few.  No, no.  Jimmy had a few pigs, though.  Um, and, uh, we went to the barn, and, uh, uh, Jimmy held this pig by the rear legs.  And, um, his brother held the pig by the front legs.  And they stretched him out.  And it was screaming, just going crazy.  And my father walked up, uh, pulled out his .357 Magnum, Smith & Wesson, and fucking one 
[00:32:30]  shot right square in his little piggy forehead.  And he was like, and his legs are twitching.  And I'm just standing there horrified, horrified.  Well, at least, all right, well, at least.  I'm a pussy.  He shot him.  Oh, it was fast.  I'm a pussy.  It was fast.  And then, and then they, they tied the rope around his legs.  Yeah.  They put it over one of the rafters in the barn, pull him up by his rear legs.  And then Jimmy just sliced his throat.  I'm a pussy. 
[00:33:00]  And watched him bleed out.  Oh, to bleed out.  Yeah.  Can you watch that, Jimmy?  No.  It's so terrible.  The shooting wouldn't be as bad to me as the way they usually, I think if they shot animals  in the head, it would be better.  Yeah.  Because it's so fast.  But, no, I would have trouble watching it.  I couldn't watch that.  They get that, that No Country for Old Men bolt thing that he had.  And that's what they use on the cows, on a steer when they're running.  Can you watch that shit?  No, not now.  I couldn't.  No.  I can't even watch videos of that shit.  Back then, I felt, you know, I was obligated to watch it.  It was like an execution. 
[00:33:30]  You didn't want to watch it, did you?  I felt like the, what was it, the son on Game of Thrones.  Right on.  The first episode where he had to go out and watch him beat, watch that guy be  beheaded.  Dude, I don't know what the fuck, I have no idea what Games of Thrones is about, but  once again, I found myself watching it in front of my in-laws.  That is a weird fucking.  A little uncomfortable to watch in front of the in-laws when there's just big tits and  fucking asses.  Some savage having sex with a woman.  It'd be a better story if I said, yeah, but they're cool.  Yeah.  But it's just, that show, man. 
[00:34:00]  I don't know what's going on, but that sex shit is awesome.  Yeah.  I don't think they've had a show with that type of sex in a long time.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  It does harken back to the beginning days of Showtime and HBO.  You see the scene with the whorehouse where they had three or four sex scenes going on  at the same time?  At the same time, yeah.  One guy's looking through the peephole while he's getting a blowjob and then he's looking  at some good shit going on in the room.  Fantastic.  Holy fuck.  I have no idea what the show's about.  I'm not even going to lie to you. 
[00:34:30]  But every time I go down to Philly, that's one of their shows they watch and I just see  a lot of sex.  Yeah.  It's a good show.  I think what Games of Thrones should do is get a sex DVD out.  Just the sex.  Just the sex of Game of Thrones.  Dude, it would sell, man.  And maybe keep the scenes going a little longer than you saw it on TV.  Right.  So it's like extras.  But it would probably be about 45 to an hour long.  That would be a sweet DVD to buy.  At the end of every sex scene, the midget comes in naked and everybody sexually abuses 
[00:35:00]  him.  Or he comes in right on center frame and just goes, da-da-da-da-da-da.  Ruins your rod.  Yeah, he comes in dressed like a little rabbit.  Little bunny ears.  See, I don't need to see penetration.  This alone is awesome.  We got a big tits.  Awesome Buxotics.  Getting inside the castle walls.  Getting it from behind.  Oh, my God.  He was supposed to be a closer person around it.  Imagine just one scene after another. 
[00:35:30]  That is hot.  You're not the only no-ba-man of my life.  I think I've got to start watching this show.  How many seasons?  It's great.  How many seasons?  The second season.  So how do I get the first season?  You get it.  Netflix, that shit.  Actually, On Demand has it.  HBO On Demand has it.  You could get every episode.  It's fucking cool.  Oh, really?  Then I'm starting today.  Yeah.  I saw this scene.  This girl was fucking ugly, but the sex scene was great.  You know, on the boat or something?  She had horrible tits.  She has a horrible face, but the scene itself was great. 
[00:36:00]  Something to be said.  No spoilers.  No spoilers.  Yeah, I'm in, though, man.  Looks like it's a good show.  Yeah, it's fucking great.  You throw a few fucking tits on the screen.  It's a good show.  Some tits.  Yeah, she's kind of a little funny looking.  Yeah, but so in the end, the Easter thing worked out.  We're all happy.  I think the tradition is going to be hide everything.  Hide everything now? 
[00:36:30]  I think I won.  Are you overturning their...  Oh, man.  And you know what?  It's fucking hot.  Overturning the fucking tradition?  Well, what I learned, I mean, when I was growing up, seven kids in the family,  the reason they hid all the Easter baskets was to keep us fucking busy.  Yeah, but don't you think you're hiding a bunch of different things?  Because, again, once you find the basket, search over.  No, because you're hiding the plastic eggs, little treats in them.  Oh, okay.  So you hide those separately from the basket.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, see, okay.  I thought you just had a basket full of stuff and you hid it. 
[00:37:00]  My almost two-year-old, almost two-year-old already.  Fuck.  Yeah, he probably had to find 20 things.  Damn.  Kept them busy for an hour.  That's a big Easter basket.  When you become a parent, well, I don't think you are.  Well, no.  But, I mean, in general, you find things that keep your kid busy.  Keep them busy.  That's pretty much what everything consists of.  Find things to keep your kid busy.  And when he was getting a little bored, then I would, like, kind of push him in a direction  where he might find something.  Ah, there you go.  I did watch my brother and sister with their kids finding eggs and whatnot, and it's just 
[00:37:30]  so frustrating.  They went outside, like, on the front lawn, and they had hidden them in, like, bushes and  stuff.  But you don't hide things really well.  You kind of hide them in plain sight.  Of course.  So there's one egg, and it's a little hedge thing that's right along the sidewalk path  to my brother's house.  And these little hedge bushes have to be maybe a foot high at most.  And they're very small.  And Joe put an egg, like, right on top of one. 
[00:38:00]  And the kids are walking around, just not seeing it.  And I'm just, like, looking.  What the fuck?  It's right there, you dummy.  It's right the fuck there.  It's frustrating, having kids.  You really want to call them dummies a lot.  Hey, stupid.  Look.  What do you think?  A fucking multicolored crayon chicken laid an egg in the fucking bush?  It's plastic.  You realize...  That's what you're looking for, you stupid.  You realize it's very easy to be one of those parents.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  One of those parents.  One of those, if you know what I mean. 
[00:38:30]  Yelling and slapping.  Just all men.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  They call them dummies.  That's it.  Next time you scream like that, you better have an arrow in you.  That's what I was told when I got a cramp in my leg and screamed because I'm 12 with  a cramp in my leg and it fucking hurt like someone was sawing through my leg.  And I let out, like, oh, what the fuck are you doing, faggot?  Next time you scream like that, you better have an arrow sticking out of you.  I'm like, arrow?  What is this?  The Old West?  What are we in fucking...  The Sioux Nation is coming upon us. 
[00:39:00]  Listen, so you think that he would have yelled at you to put the eggs in the right color?  What are you doing?  You don't put the dye together, you dummy.  Nah, he don't care.  Dad, I made it...  Go ahead, go ahead.  I need to eat them before the next day.  They wouldn't be hidden because he'd be drunk and fucking passed out in bed.  Eating hard-boiled eggs?  I'd come in.  I'd come in.  Yeah, Daddy, Dad, it's Easter.  Leave me alone.  I'm hungover.  Ro, take care of this fucking kid.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  That sucks.  Yeah.  Hey, it made me the person I am today, so I... 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I gotta be happy about that, right?  Yeah.  Jimmy just looks at me fucking feeling sad for me.  And for us.  Kids will grow up and write various swear words in Easter eggs.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, hee, hee, hee.  And they'll put their hand over their mouth and go, hee, hee, hee.  Hee, hee, hee.  Yes.  Someone is asking me about Life is Short. 
[00:40:00]  What about Life is Short?  It is office-type humor and fucking hilarious.  I tried.  I didn't like it, to be completely honest with you.  Oh.  I know that's one of the many Ricky Gervais shows out there.  Vehicles.  Most of them I really do like.  Yeah.  I didn't get into Life is Short.  I haven't seen it yet.  I thought they should have filmed it as a real documentary.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a short guy.  It's a mockumentary?  Yeah.  I'm not a big fan of the mockumentary these days.  You know, the kind of fake documentary, the scripted. 
[00:40:30]  Looking at the camera.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Reaction shot, like, oh, brother.  Because everyone's doing it, like Eugene Levy said the other day.  Right.  Eugene Levy did say that, as we recall.  Yeah.  What else?  You watched The Masters?  I saw a little bit of The Masters when I was over at my aunt and uncle's house.  That shot by?  Yeah.  The guy who we can't pronounce his name.  Yeah.  That guy.  Uzen Hosen or something.  Uzen Hosen.  Uzen.  Later Hosen.  Later Hosen.  Later.  What?  Fucking.  That was basically saying the most amazing shot ever. 
[00:41:00]  A fucking two on a par five.  Yeah.  Which is.  Did you see the shot, Jimmy?  Astounding.  They're playing it everywhere.  Yeah.  Everywhere.  There's still not a good video of this damn thing?  That's his second shot.  Second shot to a par five.  It should take five shots to, you know.  And then.  You can't even see where the fucking ball is.  I know.  Because this guy.  It just hits the green.  He filmed his TV.  I thought by now we'd have a better video of this. 
[00:41:30]  And then it just kind of rolls.  It needs one more rotation.  Boom.  Yeah.  He almost came up short.  They're basically saying one of the greatest shots ever.  In golf.  Right there.  Really was amazing.  Uzen Hosen.  To two, a par five is ridiculous.  A lot of people call it a double eagle or an albatross.  What's a double eagle mean?  Three under.  On a hole.  Oh.  That's.  Yeah.  I think it's supposed to be an albatross.  But a lot of people just say double eagle. 
[00:42:00]  If I par a five.  It's extremely rare.  It's amazing.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm amazed if I par a five.  I double eagle fives all the time.  Do you?  That's what I do.  That's what you do, huh?  That's what I do.  Sure.  They said the last time that happened, you know, maybe a hundred people saw it because  there was no TV or anything.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Wow.  And now it's like, who knows?  Hundreds of millions of people have seen that now easily.  And.  Hey, the guy that comes up behind him.  Probably shoots a nine.  Oh, just looking all stupid.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  I like Mickelson's little meltdown there.  Oh, dude.  What the fuck was he thinking?  Not taking a drop.  Oh, so you did watch.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I was.  Mickelson's famous for these.  I call them designer shots.  He was going for a high fade.  It's like, no, you don't need to do any of that.  Just take.  You're right there.  You're.  You're.  At that point, I think he was a stroke.  Maybe two strokes out.  Yeah.  Isn't he a choke artist?  He chokes a lot.  I hate Phil Mickelson.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he played a great final round.  If it wasn't for that par three, which he took.  What?  What did he end up taking?  A six or something? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a six.  That was the difference.  Or he would have been right there.  He falls apart every fucking.  Every time.  Dude.  And then he has.  He's in the woods.  And then he has to try the backwards fucking golf club.  I'm going to hit this righty, even though I'm lefty type shit.  He pulls a tin cup where, you know.  You just.  No, he did everything proper at that point.  He was just fucked.  What could he have done?  He could have taken it back to the tee, I believe.  And then.  You lose two strokes if you take it back to the tee.  He would have been hitting three at the tee.  But if he just would have taken the drop.  But he was saying he didn't have enough room. 
[00:43:30]  Right.  Even if he took the drop.  But you got two club ones.  What's take a drop mean?  You could take the ball and pick it up and drop it.  It's where you could hit it easier.  How far?  We're probably going a little too deep with this.  But I don't think he really had a.  You didn't have a good drop?  No, I don't think so.  How far can you drop it?  I think it's about two club lengths, right?  The length of two golf clubs is as far as you can drop it.  But you can't go forward, though.  No, you can't advance the ball.  That's the problem.  But if you get a better shot and go backwards. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  They couldn't even find the fucking ball.  That was a couple of days before, prior.  But Mickelson was right there.  He had a really good chance of winning the green jacket.  What do they do if they can't find the ball like that?  Oh, boy.  It's very disqualified from competition.  Will they rip a bunch of fucking leaves out so you can hit the ball?  You don't want to touch that ball ever.  You can move obstructions from around the ball, but if it touches the ball and moves the ball at all?  Then you're fucked.  Yeah, then you're fucked.  So a lot of times.  If the ball moves, you're fucked. 
[00:44:30]  You'll see them very, very precariously moving leaves.  You could ask an official permission to turn your ball to see if it's yours.  Oh, that's a good fucking gimmick.  Yeah, but if you found a ball in the woods, let's say, but you know what you're playing,  but that logo or whatever is not shown.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're allowed to spin the ball to see if it's theirs, but you have to ask permission.  Yeah.  Yeah, that Masters tournament's a good one to watch.  Richa Roos.  What'd they do with the chicken there, the IBM chick?  Chicken. 
[00:45:00]  Oh.  There wasn't much of a fuss, probably, because she doesn't play golf, I would assume,  so she doesn't care in the end.  She knew her place.  She knew her fucking place.  Yeah.  And it ain't with the men at Augusta.  All these pussies saying, no, they should allow women.  That's the easy thing to say if you're on one of these fucking TV shows.  No women.  Well, I mean, guys want to be guys sometimes.  Right.  That's all.  Just scumbaggy guys.  Women want to be women sometimes.  We don't want to fucking, you know, work our way into the nail salon, so leave us alone. 
[00:45:30]  You don't want to go to the traveling ya-ya pants hall?  Traveling ya-ya pants.  Sisterhood, ya-ha pants, fucking gaping holes, whatever shit.  Stupid shit.  You don't want to know how to make an American quilt?  Oh, shut up.  What I'm about to say, I'm sure I'll throw myself into the bus.  Oh, shit.  I had my, I did have my nails and toes done once.  Manny Petty?  And it was on, it was when my wife was about to give birth to my son and we all went as  a goof.  I swear. 
[00:46:00]  But, I mean, beat the shit out of me.  It's fine.  It was a goof.  Who doesn't suck a cock as a goof, too?  I don't know what that is, you know.  Just a goof.  Stuff like a lady.  It's fine.  It's a goof.  Yeah, for the joke he did.  That's right.  But then they're going, they're going, what nail polish do you want?  I'm like, I don't want nail polish.  Oh.  You don't put the clear on?  I didn't get nail polish.  I swear.  But this is my point, and it's really quick.  When I was in the nail salon with these women, my wife and a few of her friends and stuff,  I could tell the rest of the people there were like, why is he here? 
[00:46:30]  This is our place.  Where they can talk shit about men.  You could tell.  Yeah, they don't want you there.  And that's how it goes with guys, too.  Sometimes you just want to be a guy, and whether it's at a golf course or somewhere else, there  should be places where that's still acceptable.  We don't need you or your kind.  And I think it shows weakness that the women desperately want to be where the guys are instead  of starting their own shit.  Start your own Augusta.  Who cares?  I don't care in the end.  That'd be a little rough.  Huh?  Start your own Augusta. 
[00:47:00]  Well, true.  I mean, it takes a while because it's traditional and all that.  Yeah.  I also do think it's kind of lame, the whole fucking, the majesty, the tradition.  Thank you.  It's so fucking, it's like, it's golf.  Shut the fuck up.  Some guy's going to be out there spreading fertilizer the next day.  Thank you.  I had a few tweets about Jim Nance has to, he's talking lower than the chirping birds  here on TV.  It's like, dude, you're a mile from the action.  That's an exaggeration.  But he's, probably at times he's a half mile from the action, probably. 
[00:47:30]  Right.  He's not going to interfere with anyone's shot.  He's sort of in his own little, like, studio area.  I'm not sure if it's an open air studio, whatever.  But it's in an area where he could pretty much think if he had anyone's shot.  But everything.  It did.  Golf announcers, too.  You wouldn't.  Baseball.  Talk that low.  It's part of announcing golf, but they really overdo it for the Masters.  And they have to remind us every five seconds how it's tradition. 
[00:48:00]  And this and that.  And it's special.  This is a special tournament.  Yeah, very special.  Steeped in tradition.  Could you imagine the announcer, though?  Knitter's high.  Yeah.  Knitter's far.  Knitter's on the green.  But you're right, man.  Mickelson fucking frustrated a lot of us.  He's a player I like to see win.  I choked again, though, dude.  How did he not hate that guy?  It was one stupid hole.  And he went with this high fade.  And, I mean.  Maybe it's that arthritis he has that he talks about in those commercials. 
[00:48:30]  He was putting well, though.  He usually fucks it up on the greens.  But a lot of guys were just missing the putts, man.  There's a few of those that go in the cup.  Literally, it's on the rim.  They show it in slow motion.  It rims.  It goes down almost into the cup.  And then it comes back up and right out.  Isn't that fucked up?  It's like you think if it's going down into the cup at one point, it'll continue.  But I would make the cup twice as big.  You want the cup twice as big?  I agree with that, Vinny.  Just a bucket. 
[00:49:00]  Bury a bucket on the green.  When you're putting at long distance, when you're not a pro or not even good like me,  you're supposed to picture the hole like the size of a fucking manhole cover or something.  Really?  Yeah.  Because then if you look at the hole, the size it is, it looks daunting and it's crazy.  And odds are you're not going to get it in the hole from 10 yards out or something like that.  So you picture it as the size of a manhole, and it's a lot easier to tap it over and picture it and get the ball closer to the hole that way. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  When you're bad.  I don't know.  See, I picture it the size of a pinhole, and then when it gets closer, I'm like, oh, more room than I thought.  Ooh.  And, of course, Bubba Watson won the whole thing.  Bubba Watson has the General Lee.  What?  They're showing him with a General Lee car.  He pulls up in a Dukes of Hazzard General Lee car.  That's kind of cool.  It's nutty.  Does it have the Confederate flag on the roof, too? 
[00:50:00]  That's very politically incorrect.  You see him in his pink driver?  I think he's known for his pink driver, Ant.  Oh, right.  I did see him with his pink ping.  I'm sure the good old boys at Augusta don't appreciate Bubba Watson's pink driver.  Yeah, especially in the Dukes of Hazzard car.  Right.  You don't drive the General Lee with a fag club like that.  Whatever.  Yeah.  And, yes, thanks for all the tweets.  The Mets are 4-0 since I said I'm not a Mets fan anymore.  Amazing, right? 
[00:50:30]  Amazing.  They're the amazons.  You're doing really well, right?  And your team sucks.  And the Yankees, well, they pulled one out.  What are they, 1-4?  1-3?  What are they?  1-1.  Yeah.  Whatever.  They've won one game.  Whatever.  It's hard to be a baseball player.  This early, it's stupid to talk about anything.  Don't even fucking talk about it.  I think when we were growing up, 162 games did make sense.  But we say this every year.  It's the same break.  But I don't know, man.  2012, it feels like it'd be way more exciting if you just cut baseball games in half. 
[00:51:00]  You know, the amount of games in half, that's crazy.  Imagine an 80-game season.  You'd be watching every fucking game on the edge of your seat.  What a one-game season.  One-game season?  And then playoffs.  How great would that be?  But they want the money.  Oh, yeah.  It's all about the money.  That's the reason.  Because 162, these games mean nothing.  When does it start?  I think it starts meaning something after the 4th of July. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  It's fucking definitely after the 4th of July.  Yeah.  In the waning days of summer, that's when it really starts getting important.  You could have a team that literally stinks all fucking season.  And then they have a streak.  They pull it out at the end.  And they could be champs, even though their whole season stunk.  I love the announcers.  This series is very important.  No, it's not.  An important series as they take it back to New York.  It's not important.  No.  We're only 12 games in.  How is this important?  It's not important yet. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Whatever.  What else is going on?  How was L.A., Jimmy?  It was good, man.  It was really good.  Well, I'll land the left coast.  I went on Easter.  Oh, this is adorable.  He flew on the plane.  That's fine.  See the puppy clip with the puppy in the pool?  And the dog goes up and he's like, oh, help.  And the dog, he helps him get out of the pool.  Isn't that adorable?  Look, he jumps in and saves him.  Is that his puppy?  I guess so, right?  It must have been. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, it's golden retriever saves.  That is what you call a viral fucking video.  No, I don't think it'll do well.  Oh, my God.  It's got all the features.  I don't think it's going to do well.  The dog tries to push him out with his nose first.  He pushes it.  He's trying to push him, but dumb dog has no thumbs.  Right.  So then he realizes.  He doggie paddles over.  He doggie paddles because that's what they do.  And then realizes, okay, I could.  That's like a Rin Tin Tin moment.  It's so cool because the dog is like really doing something.  But he drags him to the middle of the yard.  Why is he still dragging him? 
[00:53:00]  Look, he's saved, dummy.  See, in the end, the dog just shows how stupid he is.  Adorable.  I would smack both of those dogs for being bad dogs.  Jimmy.  That's how you discipline a dog is.  I would look out in the pool and smack it.  Roll up the newspaper and smack him on the snout.  That would probably help now.  Dogs love being smacked on the snout.  Look at those little cute feet.  It's adorable.  The little puppy couldn't get out of the pool.  And the dog knew.  It's nice that someone was filming it.  It was in trouble.  Yeah.  Yeah, no kidding.  Hey, help me out here. 
[00:53:30]  You do forget sometimes there's someone behind the camera.  It's not just a moment captured on a camera that someone dropped and turned on.  Some asshole is thinking viral video instead of, wait a minute, I could save this dog.  Do you think while he's filming that, taping that, he's just going, oh my God, this is going to be huge.  Right.  It's got little animals.  Right.  That always does well.  It's got a little heroic, adorable moment.  Why does that guy have like fucking lipstick on TV?  Oh, that guy's speaking out about the George Zimmerman situation. 
[00:54:00]  Is that Zimmerman's new attorney?  Is that?  I have no idea who that is.  He's got very red lipstick on.  He's either got really badly chapped lips and he put Vaseline on him or he's a tranny.  Sometimes they'll fuck up your shit when you go on TV.  George Zimmerman's my client daddy.  Yeah, he does look like he wiped off some makeup quickly to get on TV.  Took his wig off.  Look at his red lips.  I know it's a visual, but.  He absolutely looks like he's a tranny.  Holy fuck. 
[00:54:30]  With the wig off, kind of.  He's a female impersonator.  Yes.  No, I mean, that sounds like his lawyers helped ward it.  He can't make any admissions or confessions.  And it's best that he not.  I mean, there's no.  Yeah.  Mark Nijimi, a CNN contributor.  Oh, well.  So we lost Mike Wallace since we last broadcasted him.  Where'd he go?  Poor Mikey.  He does great, dude.  They stole a lot of stories, though.  You know what?  Really?  Yeah.  He probably was one of the last bastions of credibility in the media. 
[00:55:00]  With CBS, very left bias.  But he was pretty good, especially in the early days.  I fucking found one of the best reports he ever did.  It was 1967.  It was called The Homosexuals.  And it's an expose on homosexuality.  That he did?  Yeah.  That he did for CBS News.  Right.  It is so archaic and so just the things they talk about, the fact that homosexuals are incapable of having steady relationships because their relationships are just based on deviant sex. 
[00:55:30]  It really is amazingly funny.  Could we do this after the break?  I want to listen to this.  Yeah.  Let's track through it a little bit.  Yeah.  You'll love some of the things they interview homosexuals and just some of the misconceptions about the homosexuals. 
[00:56:00]  It looks like the word got out to the homosexual community.  You see all the dislikes on this?  Oh, they – you know what, though?  These homosexuals are fucking idiots because it's 67.  Right.  Take it for what it is and appreciate how far you've come since 1967 and not take this at face value and go, this is terrible, hateful stuff.  Well, you know, it's 1967.  Put it in context.  You get to Pansy.  He had a 19-year-old son die in 1962. 
[00:56:30]  Damn.  The nom?  No, a hiking accident.  Damn, really?  And I realized he was 43 when that happened.  Wow.  And fucking 60 minutes started in 68, so you figure 62 plus 6, 49 when that started.  Wow.  He was always old.  He was 49 when it started.  I always felt like he was always old.  Yeah, I felt like that.  I didn't know he was 93.  And he was a big smoker.  Was he?  Yeah, well, early on.  I'm sure he quit.  They all smoked when he got up there. 
[00:57:00]  They all smoked.  Yeah, he was smoking on TV like a mad person.  Did you know his last interview was with Roger Clements?  I didn't know that.  Really?  They showed a clip saying him in his last.  Goodness gracious.  I think they said it was his last one.  Did Posada know?  Yeah.  But how did Pettit feel?  I don't know.  You know, he did a...  I'm sure there's no question about who's going to be laying in that box.  Yeah.  When he asked the Ayatollah Khomeini, he quoted... 
[00:57:30]  Ayatollah of rock and roller.  Oh, boy.  And he said to him...  He had to say it.  He quoted, I think, Anwar Sadat, I think, someone from Egypt who said that he was a disgrace  to Islam.  Oh.  And he said...  And he said...  And I said...  And I'm just quoting, like, don't blame me.  But he goes there that you're a lunatic.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  But he gets...  He was nervous...  Yeah.  Saying that.  Yeah.  As he should have been.  Yeah.  He was in Iran, huh?  Yeah.  Not easy to skip out of there.  I'm kidding. 
[00:58:00]  Well, let's play that clip after the break.  Yeah.  We'll talk about the homosexuals.  And the CNN reporter saying...  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What?  Saying what she said.  What'd she say?  Oh, you didn't...  Oh, boy.  You didn't see that?  I don't like saying it.  You didn't see that?  I don't know what she said.  You know what she said.  No, I don't.  Oh, my God.  What happened to you?  Did you fly to L.A. in a bubble?  No.  That's a good one.  I don't know why she even said that, because aside from the racially insensitive word, there  is just a blatant curse that isn't normally allowed to be said on the news. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, but then we get mad when they don't say it.  I know.  I know, but it was shocking.  I know the story.  She apologized, too.  It's so weird.  Wobbledoodle.  An old white woman saying it.  I know.  What was she thinking?  We should break so we can really get into this proper.  We're going to get into it proper.  I like watching golf on TV.  And I read recently, this is true, NBC Sports.  On their golf telecast, they got caught putting in bird noises for ambiance.  Birds aren't even there.  And a bird lover called him on it because he was hearing a bird that was not indigenous 
[00:59:00]  to where the tournament was being held.  Wow.  Can you imagine being the guy who had to field that phone call?  Uh, yeah, sports department.  Uh, yeah, hi.  Hi.  Listen, uh, does this sound right to you?  Whistling.  Whistling.  No, that don't. 
[00:59:30]  Um, I don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah, yeah, apparently you don't.  Yeah, I guess I'm supposed to believe the blue-breasted whippoorwillow  has decided to alter its annual migratory route to enjoy a little golf.  What?  Maybe for that region you should try...  Whistling.  Whistling. 
[01:00:00]  Okay.  I get it.  I got one.  Cuckoo!  Cuckoo!  Cuckoo for cuckoo!  Cuckoo for cuckoo!  You have to admire that guy.  You have to admire him.  You're not going to slip a chirp past him.  What the hell was that?  Please tell me I did not just hear that.  Please, please tell me this is not happening to me today. 
[01:00:30]  I wish he would have handled it differently.  I wish instead of calling, he would have snuck in there late at night,  pulled out that bird tape, you know, stuck in another animal track.  No one would even know until it's going out live.  Um, Ernie Ells is looking at about a 10-foot putt here.  This is, this is a downhill putt. 
[01:01:00]  It's going to break a little bit to his left.  Oh!  Man, he is focused!  I want you to do me a favor.  I want you to stop sending money to World Hunger Organizations.  Well, I don't want to seem cruel, you know, but, uh... 
[01:01:30]  I'm an American, you know?  You're just like you.  I think we've done a lot.  I think we pretty much fucking give out.  You know, we give, we give, we give.  And they fucking make these commercials to fuck with your head.  You know, you're sitting at home, you're having a wonderful time,  enjoying what the fuck you put together from scratch,  on your own, in your own life.  You turn on the television, and they got this fucking two-year-old,  three-inch-waisted kid, and we're going... 
[01:02:00]  And the voiceover's like,  Won't you please help?  What kind of sick fucking bastard are you?  How can you sit there,  in that air-conditioned,  fully heated home,  in an icebox and cupboard,  full of food,  in a country where you can eat 24 hours a day,  while little Haji...  Pick up that fucking phone. 
[01:02:30]  Won't you please help him?  God, that sick fuck are you?  You're really trying to guilt-trip the shit out of him.  It's like, hey,  why don't you feed him?  You're only five feet away!  Why don't you give him one of your sandwiches,  you pack for the day?  Help him!  Help him!  Fuckin' commercials, man.  You know the guys right off camera with a baby Ruth going,  they can't see me, can they?  Come here, hear it. 
[01:03:00]  If I can only walk...  Come on, it's right there, reach for...  Come on, they gear these fucking things up the fuck with your head, man.  They ain't know what they're doing.  Got a director there going,  Come on, don't feed him yet!  Don't feed him yet!  My life was bad on that last one.  Let's give one more take.  Come on, Haji, get back in the mud hole.  Come on.  Come on, let's get out of here,  these fucking mosquitoes, Jesus.  We don't need that shit.  You want to help them? 
[01:03:30]  You really want to help these people?  Stop sending them food.  Don't send these people another bike.  You want to help them?  Send them U-Hauls.  Send them luggage, folks.  Send them somebody like me.  I'll walk out there.  Send a guy there that goes,  Hey, we just drove 700 miles with your food.  And it occurred to us that there wouldn't be world hunger  if you people would live where the food is!  You live in a fucking desert!  They understand that you live in a fucking desert! 
[01:04:00]  You live in a fucking desert!  You live in a fucking desert!  Nothing grows here!  Nothing's gonna grow here!  Come on, come on!  Son of a bitch!  You see this, huh?  You see this?  This is sand, yeah!  Did you know nothing can grow in this shit?  Did you know that, huh?  Here, eat some of it.  Taste it, motherfucker!  It's sand!  You know what's gonna be 100 years from now?  It's gonna be sand!  You live in a fucking desert! 
[01:04:30]  Get your cans, get your shit!  We'll make one trip!  We'll take you to where the food is!  We have deserts in America!  We just don't live in an asshole!  SiriusXM.  And now, the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Loving it.  Sam Kinison.  20 years ago today.  What?  That's unbelievable.  20 years ago.  We lost Sam Kinison 20 years ago today.  I was driving right past the Westbury Music Fair. 
[01:05:00]  When you found out?  Yeah, yeah.  I was right there, because I had a job to go to that was relatively close.  And I was pulling in the parking lot to go to the deli to get something for breakfast.  And, yeah.  I remember hearing that.  Exactly.  It was actually on Stern's show.  And heard they were bumming.  Oh, God, yeah.  Vinny Brand told me.  In North Brunswick.  I still live in North Brunswick.  And I was at Vinny's house.  He lived with his first wife. 
[01:05:30]  And he had a...  It was called Dude and Ali's Peanut Ranch, I think.  He sold flowers.  And then his kids' nicknames were Dude, Ali, and Peanut, I think, were his kids' nicknames.  So that he named the place after them.  So he had, like, this really weird flower shop attachment to his house.  I think that's what they sold.  Vinny had a flower shop?  I believe so, yeah.  Attached to his house.  Before he owned a comedy club.  So weird.  He was just booking.  How did you know him, then?  Oh, because he was booking comedians.  And Vinny was doing stand-ups.  So we would do gigs.  Right.  I still remember a bit Vinny did. 
[01:06:00]  We did a fucking...  It was a pool area in, like, a Holiday Inn.  And Levy was headlining.  And I think Vinny was hosting or middle...  I don't remember.  But he did a bit about the...  This was after the first Iraq war was happening.  And the bit, he had, like, pretending he was John Madden on a chalkboard doing the fucking...  You know, they were going to hit the soldiers.  I forget what the bit was.  A battle plan kind of a thing?  It was a battle plan John Madden thing.  Nice.  It was just bombed miserably.  Oh, really?  Of course.  As it should have.  But Vinny told me that Kinnison died.  Fucking Kinnison was one of the greats. 
[01:06:30]  I forgot how funny he was.  He was on a lot of people's top five list.  Yeah.  Right?  Sam is right the fuck up there.  He's not in my top five, but he was great.  What's your top five, then?  As I'm yelling at you.  Pryor, Carlin.  Nice.  The classics.  Woody.  And then the next two, I'm not 100% sure.  Cosby, I'd probably put up there.  Even though he's not my personal favorite, I acknowledge he's one of the greats.  I'd go Pryor.  Carlin first, by the way.  That's where we're different. 
[01:07:00]  Okay.  Because Jimmy likes Pryor first.  You're a racist.  I'd go Carlin, Pryor, Bill Hicks, Sam Kinnison, with a spot left for my top five.  I'd have to think about the next one.  I almost would put someone like Chris Rock up there.  When fucking Chris Rock is on, he fucking...  Chris is great, man.  I'd have to think about it.  Who would be my fifth one?  You got a top five in?  Nah.  You got a couple you'd just throw on a list?  Ah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:07:30]  To start off your list?  Ah, Carlin Pryor.  There you go.  Perfect.  Perfect.  I don't know who that last one would be.  For you?  Yeah.  So you got four, too?  I might put Joan Rivers in my fifth.  I really...  Paul Land.  She's made me laugh a lot.  She's a great comic.  She's very underrated as a stand-up.  I may put Joan Rivers.  I'm thinking either Yakov, Schmierner.  No, he'd be top number one.  With the magnetic trays.  I can't think of anything about him without thinking of those magnetic trays.  Or Emo Phillips.  Oh, God.  Was he awful. 
[01:08:00]  Yakov's Dinner Adventure.  All right, Yakov.  Woody has to be in the top five.  See, the only reason I don't put Woody Allen, I just don't know his stuff that well.  I should go listen to some Woody Allen albums.  His stand-up, which he stopped doing in like 64 or 65.  My mother would bring home the three-record set when I was a kid, and I would listen to them  and mimic the routines, it's still conceptually smarter than anything people are doing.  It's depressing how fucking genius he is.  Imagine if he just said, you know what, I'm going to go do some stand-up for a while. 
[01:08:30]  God, why would you just totally give it up?  Because he got sick before.  I heard he would vomit before he'd perform.  He hated performing.  He hated it.  He was awkward to watch.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  No, no, Sam.  But his bits were just genius.  Sam's putting the Yakov Dinner Adventure video.  We've already ran through that twice.  Probably twice.  Maybe three times at this point.  Oh, we'll do it three or four times, but just not today.  I'm going to go check out some Woody Allen.  It's called The Nightclub Years.  Probably on iTunes. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  But Kenison was just an animal.  Yeah.  Fucking just an animal.  The shit he would be saying today.  Fuck.  Oh, man.  Wow.  He was trying to get his shit together when he died, too, right?  Was he?  There were rumors he was trying to get his shit together.  He was crazy with the coke.  He was sober when he died.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And then his...  Yeah, that's right.  It was very ironic.  And then a kid, what?  Fucking head-on collision.  Yeah.  And then his claim to fame.  He would tell people he was one that killed Sam Kenison.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  He ended up being a real fucking scumbag. 
[01:09:30]  Was he?  Yeah.  He didn't even care.  Yeah, he used to brag about it.  No.  I know, right?  Is there a picture of the kid?  I don't think I've ever seen a picture of the kid.  Piece of shit.  Who the fuck does that?  Yeah.  What?  Sam's brother tells the famous story of Kenison talking to someone as he's dying?  That's Carl LeBeau.  Carl LeBeau?  Yeah.  Oh, he had his brother Bill.  No, I think Bill was there, too.  Okay, because Carl was there.  Who's that?  That's the kid?  Oh.  Oh, you silly goose.  Yeah.  Why don't you know how to pull pictures up there, Sam? 
[01:10:00]  But 20 years ago today.  Fuck.  Wow.  All right.  Man, that's a long time.  What were we getting to?  Mike Wallace.  Right.  Mike Wallace.  You know, when these celebrities die, really quick, because Sam's getting the clip together,  people feel like they have to be, what's the word I'm looking?  They come up with a tweet.  Right, right, right.  Are they pondering?  Are they, what would you say?  Well, I'll read one, and you tell me what this is. 
[01:10:30]  All right.  This fucking drove me nuts.  Ann Curry.  Yeah.  Tough questions are being asked in heaven today.  Profound.  Profound is the word.  Thank you, Ann.  Yeah.  I'm more profane.  What'd I say?  Ponder?  That's stupid.  That was just stupid.  Prolific.  Profound.  I knew it was a P word.  And then she writes, R.I.P.  Mike Wallace.  Tough questions are being asked in heaven today.  Really?  Do you think Mike Wallace wants to fucking, he's dead, he goes to heaven, he wants to continue 
[01:11:00]  just doing a job?  That's the place where you don't ask questions.  Right.  Guess what?  You get all the answers if you believe.  Yeah.  Maybe there's.  If you believe that, that's the one time where you get all the answers.  Mike Wallace is a tough question.  He probably asked the guy, why was I so depressed that I tried to commit suicide in the 80s?  Got us to answer that.  And where were the footplums?  Footplums.  Wow.  That hurt.  Tripped over my own fucking tongue.  CBS reports on the homosexuals with Mike Wallace. 
[01:11:30]  The homosexuals.  Ann found this.  1967?  67.  I've never seen this clip.  I haven't either until just the other day.  The homosexuals with CBS News correspondent Mike Wallace.  Hi, Mike.  Homosexuality isn't a new one.  What's old there?  Even in this era of bold sexual mores, it remains a subject that people find disturbing,  embarrassing, and the reluctance to discuss it. 
[01:12:00]  Yet there is a growing concern about homosexuals in society, about their increasing visibility.  Heh, yeah, damn it.  In preparing this broadcast, CBS News commissioned a survey by the Opinion Research Coalition.  Went to glory holes.  I know.  Around the country.  Homosexuality.  We discovered that Americans consider homosexuality more harmful to society than adultery, abortion,  or prostitution.  We shall present other results of the survey later in the broadcast, and we shall investigate  some of the medical, legal, and social aspects of homosexuality. 
[01:12:30]  They frequent their own clubs and bars and coffee houses where they can act out in the  fashion that they want to, where they can escape the disapproving eye of the society that  they call straight.  No one knows exactly how many homosexuals there are in the United States.  There's no remarkable way to find out, for most of them are unwilling to acknowledge it.  The Kinsey Report of 1948 dealt only with white males.  It estimated that one in 25 is exclusively homosexual throughout his adult life. 
[01:13:00]  Wow.  Other estimates range as high as one in six.  The truth lies somewhere in between.  The butt cheeks.  And some men venture into homosexual experimentation for a year or two, then revert to heterosexuality.  Really?  Some are bisexual.  They marry, have children, and keep their homosexual contacts on the side.  This is called being on the DL.  Male homosexuals in America number in the millions, and their number is growing.  Ha!  They're dancing. 
[01:13:30]  They are attracted mostly to the anonymity that a big city gives them.  New York, Chicago, Los Angeles.  It's talking about them like animals.  The permissiveness and the variety of the city draw them.  The average homosexual, if there be such, is promiscuous.  He's not interested in nor capable of a lasting relationship like that of a heterosexual marriage.  His sex life, his love life, consists of a series of chance encounters at the clubs and bars he inhabits, 
[01:14:00]  and even on the streets of the city.  The pick-on-night stand, these are characteristic of the homosexual relationship.  And the homosexual prostitute has become a fixture on the downtown streets at night,  on street corners, at subway exits.  Jim, can you vouch for that?  He makes it just seem fun.  They don't have relationships.  They dump loads, and they always come when they want to.  You know, for 1967, he saves face, though.  He didn't sound that outrageous. 
[01:14:30]  What, the fact that homosexuals are incapable of a normal relationship?  It's 1967, so obviously you're going to have some misinformation there, but I thought it would be way worse.  Really?  I thought he would really portray them as just...  Well, they do, they do...  Like animals, animals.  Right.  That was kind of a highlight reel.  You know what I'm saying, Jimmy?  It wasn't that bad.  Obviously, some misinformation there.  You know what it is?  That was like a highlight reel of some of what he was saying.  The whole story is over 45 minutes long, I think. 
[01:15:00]  And they got, like, law enforcement people that want them locked in jail.  And so he was okay and kind of presenting it as a reporter would, especially in that day and age.  But some of the interviews they do are really like, oh, my God, I can't believe this guy is saying that they should be put in jail.  Yeah, don't...  Yeah, I mean, obviously...  I think it's great, though.  It's like a little time capsule of what the thought process was. 
[01:15:30]  Some of these clips you see from the old days are way worse than that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm saying, I guess.  Well, there's those public service announcements and stuff about...  Yeah, the pod.  Homos.  And the other...  Yeah.  You're homo.  Yeah.  We've played a few.  Yeah, yeah.  Where the guy's in the car and he's just, like, scoping around for young boys.  Right.  The homosexual.  Yeah, that's the anti-homosexual.  Yeah, this is the 50s.  It's a PSA from the 50s.  Creepy 1950s anti-homosexual PSA.  Sid Davis Productions presents... 
[01:16:00]  Boys Beware!  Boys Beware.  Sorry, sorry.  That's great.  That voice just sounded fun.  I wanted to jump in.  It is fun.  I just wanted to jump in.  But it's for the cooperation of the Inglewood Police Department and the Inglewood Unified School District.  No Negroes in Inglewood.  Why couldn't they hold the graphics, though?  Why do they always move around a little bit?  Everything's shaky back then.  Yeah, weird.  All right, here we go.  Yay!  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Oh, this is long. 
[01:16:30]  They're by the school.  We haven't played this in a while.  Well, we'll just get to, like, the first...  Parents yell at you.  ... nasty thing that they say about gays.  A guy leaving the police department.  Sure.  Getting in his car.  Is it?  I thought it was a school.  Uh, that guy's leaving the police department.  Is he, is he, is he gay?  Getting in his car.  Is he pulling away and driving?  Is he gay?  I'm Lieutenant William.  Oh, he's Lieutenant William.  Police officer attached to the juvenile division.  Hi.  I'm on my way to Monroe Junior High School to talk to a group of young people. 
[01:17:00]  Ah, young people.  It looks innocent enough, doesn't it?  Thoughts of young people hitchhiked.  Seems like a good way to get from one place to another.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Pause.  That is...  Oh, my God.  That's fucked up.  You know how many people were just killed by serial killers?  I used to, I used to hitchhike in the early 80s from Geneseo to Buffalo to take...  Child thereof.  To, thank you.  To take, uh, my, uh, my, my people's airline flight back to Long Island.  Flying bus.  But no one would drive me to Buffalo for, so I could save fucking... 
[01:17:30]  Dude hitch?  Yeah, with a knife in my sock, because I, I knew...  Look out.  I knew that that was not the smartest thing, but I didn't know what else to fucking do.  And now if you see a hitchhiker, you're like, what the fuck, dude?  No one's picking up a hitchhiker.  No.  Except maybe trucker is that rule of the road thing.  Uh, and, and no one is really hitchhiking unless, unless they're crazy people or killers.  No one hitchhikes anymore.  No, man.  It's fucking insane.  Yeah, you see one, you're like, there's no fucking way.  And back then, the cop is actually going, this looks innocent enough, and he's passing 
[01:18:00]  by three kids hitching.  Right.  A good way to get around.  Just a good way to get around.  Just getting in a car with a stranger as a young boy.  Insanity.  Let's listen to a little more of this, uh, officer.  Balls that never meet the eye.  Let's take the case of Jimmy Barnes.  Oh, Jimmy played baseball all afternoon.  Oh, shit.  Bonds hitchhikes.  Jimmy Bonds. 
[01:18:30]  He doesn't feel like walking after playing sports all day.  Nobody can molest Bonds.  But Bonds.  Jimmy Bonds was just picked up.  Bonds want to talk about sucking dick?  The last was a cum walker.  In fact, he seemed like a real nice guy.  He asked Jimmy if he played baseball in the park often.  Jimmy told him they practiced three times a week and played a rival group on Friday afternoon.  The stranger was a good listener, too.  Jimmy told him they practiced three times a week and then beat the Jigaboos on Friday. 
[01:19:00]  Jesus.  The bat smells like duty.  Yes.  Fast forward.  Jimmy has a face full of back seat leather while the bat is being inserted into his buttocks.  His athletic supporter is binding his hands behind his back.  Fuck, Jimmy.  Fuck, Jimmy.  He got in the car with a homosexual.  Well, let's see what happens.  Jimmy Barnes is going to get a buggering. 
[01:19:30]  Buggering.  Good rogering.  And it only seemed minutes before they pulled up in front of Jimmy's house.  That's nice enough.  This is good.  I gave him a ride.  He was hitching.  After he learned a little bit about each other.  Dropped him off at home.  Nice.  When Jimmy got out, the stranger gave him a friendly pat.  Ooh.  On his crotch.  It's from Munaki.  Bad joke.  He told him he'd see him again.  It was like Nicholson.  He always drove by the park on his way home.  I'll see you again.  There it goes.  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  You ain't never been right.  Oh, boy.  He's back at the park now.  He's throwing his glove up in the air as he walks back.  Kind of walking home, I guess.  Right enough.  Hey.  The following day when Jimmy finished playing ball.  All right.  Now what happens?  They're waiting.  Yes.  Hey, get in, Jimmy.  Get in.  All right.  Jimmy's stupid.  Yeah.  Next thing you see, Jimmy being brutally raped with leaves in his hair.  He's getting a conversation about veal and how you can pound that shit all day. 
[01:20:30]  And the stranger treated him to a coat.  During their conversation, he told several off-color jokes.  Oh.  But Jimmy has heard others before.  Why did chicken cross the road?  I don't know.  Because he had a cock.  Oh.  Choo-choo's walking along.  I have one, too.  Why did ducks crack along?  How do you babysit, nigga? 
[01:21:00]  Holy shit.  A few off-color jokes.  Off-color jokes.  Yeah.  But Jimmy had heard others before, and, well, it made him feel big to so easily win the confidence  of an older person.  Right.  Look at the ducks in the park.  Yeah.  They're in the park looking at the lake.  They're at the park.  That's nice.  What a fucking...  He took them to the park.  Yeah.  Looks like Jimmy wants a penis.  Yeah, looks like Jimmy is introducing him. 
[01:21:30]  The following Saturday, they went fishing together.  What the fuck is this?  A date?  By now, they were using first names.  Ralph said it was more friendly.  Ralph.  Ralph.  There you go, Ralph.  Ralph.  It seems like a lot of work to get a penis.  Oh, man.  I know.  What the fuck?  It seems like Jimmy is...  Conk him on the head.  The old guy just wants a friend.  Jimmy's trying to fuck him.  Jimmy hadn't enjoyed himself so much in a long time.  Really?  Jimmy having peanut butter sandwiches with Ralph and the sunglasses.  During lunch, Ralph showed him some pornographic things.  Jimmy knew he shouldn't be interested, but he really was curious. 
[01:22:00]  Yes.  What Jimmy didn't know was that Ralph was sick.  A sickness that was not visible like smallpox, but no less dangerous and contagious.  A sickness of the mind.  You see, Ralph was a homosexual.  A person who demands an intimate relationship.  Demands.  Ages.  He sneezed on me and I have a cock in my mouth now.  What happened?  You catch it when the...  You catch homosexuality when the semen of another man bubbles over your knuckles. 
[01:22:30]  Yes.  It is...  He introduced his system through your cuticles.  Glork.  Glorka.  Glorka.  They went fishing.  They had sandwiches.  They looked at ducks.  Yeah, and then he showed them some fucking porn.  Whatever happened, he just fucking pushed someone's face against the window.  Exactly.  A gun's like a great day so far.  Yeah, they're having fun.  What's wrong?  So what if Ralph fucking ruins your asshole?  You had a great day at the park, didn't you, you fucking punk?  You went fishing.  You fed the ducks.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  You gotta pay back a little bit.  He brought you lunch.  Yeah.  He's driving.  He's driving you everywhere.  He's not asking for gas money.  This is nice.  Ass, gas, or grass.  No one rides for free.  That's right.  So what?  You want to play baseball with the Puerto Ricans?  That's fine.  Just let Ralph take you home, fucking blow you at the park.  You can look at ducks while you fucking shoot jizz in Ralph's old mouth.  His mustachioed face.  It's chrome dome.  Ralph stinks.  Ralph is a fucking crud.  He is a creep. 
[01:23:30]  Let's hear a little more about homosexuality.  From the 50s.  From the 50s, yeah.  But by now, Jimmy felt a fondness for Ralph.  Fondness.  It's been three dates.  They continue to go places together.  Miniature golf.  Jesus.  It's a Vicky and Jake LaMotta's date.  I'm gonna get to the dick sucking.  Jesus.  He knew it was getting a little weird during mini golf when he made him squat down.  It ain't for his bunghole.  Yes.  His penis hit his testicles like a mini golf club.  Holy fuck. 
[01:24:00]  They're in love.  Uh-oh.  He bought presents and even gave him money.  But payments were expected in return.  Oh, shit.  You see, Jimmy hadn't recognized Ralph's approach sooner.  He's taking him up to his apartment.  When Ralph first asked Jimmy to go fishing alone, he should have discussed it with his parents or teacher.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Now he's taking him up to his hotel room?  Finally, Jimmy told his parents.  And they reported it to the juvenile authority.  Oh, shit.  What happened?  Oh, my Paul.  They're leaving. 
[01:24:30]  They just yada, yada, yada'd us at this shit.  I don't like that yada, yada, yada shit.  They show him going up to the apartment.  Right.  With Ralph.  And then the next shot is his parents.  Very June and Ward Cleaver-like.  Cockblockers, yeah.  Yeah, the old cockblockers.  And they're coming out of the police station.  Oh, fuck.  This ain't worth fucking...  Now, you've got to use your imagination.  It certainly isn't the fact that they were fishing.  It wasn't the fact that he even took them to his hotel.  Right.  Something happened up in that hotel room that that father is now disowning his son for. 
[01:25:00]  Yes.  Oh, God.  Well, how are they going to teach the kids without the action?  Yeah, that's true.  How do I know what's the bad part?  Right.  You know, fishing?  Right.  Eating sandwiches?  Notice Jimmy holding Ralph's head and grunting.  They have a little blow-up fucking inner tube for Jimmy to sit on when they drive him home from the police station.  Notice Ralph breathing through his nose to perform better oral sex so he doesn't have to pull his mouth off of Jimmy's hog. 
[01:25:30]  How disgraced is that father leaving the police station after his son has to talk about his raping?  His molesting.  Ralph sucks.  Actually, he probably did it willingly because, you know, he was friends with Ralph.  Yeah, he probably kissed him.  Yeah.  But he realized it was wrong.  He realized, I've got to go to the fucking cops on this.  We need Mr. McGregor.  What's all this, then?  What happened there?  What happened there with Ralph?  Don't you know he's a homosexual?  Oh, Irish cops back then. 
[01:26:00]  Great.  He's no Mr. McGregor with the spilling of the paint.  No.  Mr. McGregor at least kept it fucking in his shop.  Kept it fun.  Remember Mr. McGregor's stupid wife making cookies while there's a horror show going on?  She knew something was a mess and she didn't do shit.  Down in the basement.  Her iPod's on so she doesn't hear them yelling.  Making cock-shaped cookies.  Let's go back to Ralph.  Yeah, where's Ralph?  Right.  And Jimmy was released on probation in the custody of his parents. 
[01:26:30]  Wait, what?  Hold on.  Jimmy got arrested?  Yeah, and put on probation.  For homosexuality, right?  But how?  Wow, because he committed a crime.  Wait, so that's...  The crime of sodomy.  So that's basically telling the youths back in the 50s, if you have some of that gay sex...  Yeah, you're up for fucking...  And it wasn't of your choosing...  You're going to be arrested.  You're going to be arrested.  So why would you ever go to the police?  Why would you go to the cops?  Boy, this is a PSA for homosexual predators.  Right.  Wow.  Why the fuck would you ever go to the police station? 
[01:27:00]  He was released on probation.  He was sentenced to prison where he was fucked in the ass every day.  You would never tell your parents?  No.  That's crazy.  Imagine the Leave it to Beaver episode where...  Wow!  Gee, Dad, Eddie Haskell's a creep.  Fuck me in the ass.  Well, Beaver, I'm going to use that language.  How is he on probation?  Yeah, he...  Technically, he isn't supposed to have done anything wrong.  Wow.  He's the victim.  Wow, what a horrible message.  It really is an awful 50s message.  See, you did wrong, son.  Well, at least he wasn't a Negro. 
[01:27:30]  Just fucking...  And everything's fine.  That's right.  At least it wasn't a Negro.  Let her rip.  That would give you a life sentence.  Yeah.  Finally, Jimmy told his parents.  Yeah.  And they reported it to the juvenile authorities.  Ralph was arrested, and Jimmy was released on probation in the custody of his parents.  That's okay, son.  Uh-oh.  But all homosexuals are not passive.  Some resort to violence is in the case of Mike Merrick. 
[01:28:00]  Mike?  Merrick.  Mike?  That's my cock, Mike.  What do you say, Bill?  All right, the kids are playing basketball.  Send the girls home, Fredo.  No one noticed the man who sat and watched.  He's watching the kids.  The kids are on 15.  Basketball.  And the others left.  Mike decided to stay and practice a little longer.  Oh, Mike.  Mike, run, Mike.  There's a homosexual on the bench.  Come on.  Oh, no, no.  Mike stinks.  The stranger joined him.  Oh.  He was friendly.  He's in a suit playing basketball. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Bring a suit.  God, they stink.  They really suck.  After a few shots, Mike realized he had already overstayed his time and suggested he better  leave.  Oh, boy.  The stranger told him if he'd like to stay longer, he'd be glad to drive him home.  The Kiwi Herman bow tie on the stranger.  Yeah, why do you have a bow tie?  You have to play longer and get a ride home, too.  Yeah.  All right, they can play longer.  That's nice.  What's going to be this guy's move, you think?  Lead pipe.  Crowbar, yeah.  Oh, man. 
[01:29:00]  It is cute, though.  Yeah.  Good hair.  This greasy fucking slicked back hair.  Nice abs.  That hair grease is going to be all over the stranger's belly.  And his ass.  Yeah.  The companionship.  The guy's dribbling the ball towards the car.  Get the hint.  That's hilarious.  Put his arm around the kid already.  Here we go.  He's got his arm around him leading him to the car.  He moves in quick, this guy.  I love this guy.  He certainly does.  He's swooping right in.  He couldn't wait.  Aha, stupid. 
[01:29:30]  That's okay.  I had a little water spilt, but we're okay.  All right, let her rip.  Everything's good.  He probably never realized until too late that he was riding in the shadow of death.  Death?  But sometime that evening, Mike Merrick traded his life for a newspaper headline.  Holy shit.  The homosexual killed him?  Yeah, but we don't get to see any of that action either.  He's 50s homosexuals.  Denny and Jerry got the papers ready for Jerry's afternoon delivery.  They only casually noticed the two boys that raced by in the afternoon traffic. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  And they didn't pay much attention to the car that drew up shortly afterwards.  Oh, shit.  Until the man called them over.  All right, he's calling them over.  Two kids sit outside the mailbox.  Yeah.  And two boys been by on bicycles.  The boys nodded.  They had, could they recognize them if they saw them again?  Well, then he guessed he could.  Then hop in, the man said.  What?  Pause.  Oh, man.  How about this idiot continues after the guys on the bike?  Why would he stop?  Because he's trying to pick these two up.  Oh. 
[01:30:30]  He's the predator.  He's lying to these kids.  He saw the guys on the bike and he's trying to get help.  Now, but how does...  I feel like a complete idiot.  What was he waiting for somebody on a bike, I guess?  No, he was just thinking of an excuse.  He saw kids on the bike.  He saw these two.  He's like, oh, I'll get these two fucking juicy-ass kids to help me find those two fucking  sweaty, bald ones on the bikes.  Well, then these two are dumb.  Because when you think, why doesn't the guy just continue chasing the bike guys?  Yeah, what the fuck?  I'm standing strong on my thoughts on this one.  Yeah, I agree with you.  All right.  Fine.  He guessed he could.  Then hop in, the man said. 
[01:31:00]  Those are stolen bikes.  Oh, this guy's going for two.  They're trading.  Without giving it another thought, then he got in on the car.  Oh, only one got out.  Jerry watched.  He'd been told many times, if a friend got in a car with a stranger to write down the license,  number.  Ah, good idea.  It seemed to apply, but, well, fortunately, he marked it down.  I-M-G-A-Y.  Yeah.  K-I-D-M-R-D-R.  Oh, wow.  I-F-K-I-D-S.  Yay.  He asked his mother if they'd caught the boys that had stolen the bicycles. 
[01:31:30]  What bicycles?  Then he hadn't returned, so he told her the story and gave her the paper with the license  number.  Oh, boy.  With the license number.  He was dead by the hands of a homeless station.  Oh, because he did the right thing, so they were able to kill him in time and time.  Then she decided to call the police.  Yeah.  Jerry supplied the necessary information, and the stranger's car was quickly spotted.  It was a good example of how important it is to always get the license number and description  of any stranger who takes a young person off the road. 
[01:32:00]  But the police were wrong and pulled over a black man and beat him to death.  And then they pulled over and they raped the kid, too.  The cops did.  The guy did.  What I like about this, the music makes it sound like a Disney film.  Yeah, it's nice.  The quick restrooms can often be a hangout for the homosexuals.  Where?  A what?  Bobby and his friends hadn't noticed.  Men's restroom.  Oh.  In the restroom when they change.  Well, where the fuck is supposed to go to be?  Exactly.  They took the shortcut under the pier.  They found George Michael inside masturbating.  The others preferred to test the more traveled way home. 
[01:32:30]  The music.  We're going in the bathroom.  Gonna get a blowjob.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, this is the homosexual walking.  Oh, shit.  Don't go under the docks.  He's going through a hole in the fence underneath the pier.  And the homosexual...  Bobby recognized the stranger as the man in the restroom.  Oh, shit.  The shortcut under the pier didn't seem like a good idea at all.  Yeah, you smart kid right there, huh?  He ran off.  Yeah, but that guy...  Who's the guy gonna rape?  I know. 
[01:33:00]  It's terrible.  That guy's in a...  In a suit on the beach?  On the beach in a suit.  The homosexual will always be in a suit.  It may have saved his life.  Or his ass.  Very least.  The decision is always yours.  Yep.  And your whole future may depend on making the right one.  Yeah.  So no matter where you meet a stranger...  Where?  Be careful if they are too friendly.  Yep.  Jim.  If they try to win your confidence too quickly...  Right, Jim.  ...and if they become overly...  I love a friendly stranger. 
[01:33:30]  ...one ever knows when the homosexual is about.  Is about.  He may appear normal.  Is the homosexual about?  It's too late when you discover he is mentally ill.  So keep with your group.  Yeah.  And don't go off alone with strangers...  Unless you have the permission of your parent or teacher.  Teachers.  Or the stranger says it's okay.  Teachers are so integral in like telling you shit outside of school.  Imagine a teacher fucking saying, hey, if some gay guy comes up to you...  I'll be here to talk to you.  They'd be fired.  Fired, so fired.  The kid would be in counseling. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, man.  That is really something.  It's weird to look back.  It really is.  Boy, the gay...  You know, the gay cause.  Certainly has come a long way.  They're going to look back at some of the shit we're doing today.  Yeah.  People are going to be like, that's weird.  Like what?  I think we're...  I don't know.  Everything's fine now.  We're all good.  We finally figured everything out, right?  Yeah.  We're good with everyone.  I think you might be right.  We know everything about everyone.  Let's break.  Ooh.  Hey, do we have, uh...  I'm going to the restroom.  I hope to find a friend in there. 
[01:34:30]  I'm going to follow Anthony down the hall.  Be careful of a man in sweatpants following you down the hall.  Into the restroom.  A little bald man in glasses.  Bent over my face in a urinal cake.  Beware of a management who looks like Jughead.  Coming in and giving a half a smirk and a head shake.  In a horrible black denim jacket.  We got Chris Elliott coming in at 9.30.  Oh, he is coming in. 
[01:35:00]  We should promote that today, huh?  All righty.  CNN reporter.  Older white lady saying some wild stuff.  Homosexual?  No.  Well, we'll find out next.  Coming up next on an all-new Meet the McGregor's.  Mr. Mac invites over Robbie from next door to build a birdhouse.  I've got a special job for you today.  Oh, and steady.  That's the way.  But Mr. Mac has been drinking bourbon all afternoon and has a few other ideas.  You missed a spot right up there. 
[01:35:30]  That silly drunk spills paint all over young Robbie.  Guess who doesn't have a change of clothes?  Just take off your clothes.  I'll help you clean up.  Yeah, that feels good, doesn't it?  Someone better call the authorities.  Mr. McGregor has another naked boy in his house.  Now, I'm going to take a picture to remember the day we spilled the paint.  There.  That's what the cops call Exhibit A. 
[01:36:00]  The fun really starts when Mrs. McGregor comes home and finds a dirty shoebox full of Polaroids under the bed.  It all goes down tonight on Meet the McGregor's.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  He's so horny.  The Series XM.  Coming up on the next episode of The Spectacular Suicide.  Police Commissioner Vic Dumb grills our young hero about his mishandling of the Angerman incident.  Meanwhile, a deadly new temptress lurks in the shadows. 
[01:36:30]  Goddamn suicide.  How many times have I told you?  I know, but the children.  That's enough.  You screwed up the entire operation and Angerman managed to escape.  He escaped?  Thomas.  How'd that happen?  I'm unstoppable.  Never mind that.  It's our case now.  Stay the hell out of the way.  But, but, but.  That's enough.  Stay here.  I'm not finished with you.

My beauty was too much for this police department to handle.  Now they're all stuck in my sexy tracks.  No, you didn't.  Oh yes I did.  And now I have you all to myself.  Now, suicide. 
[01:37:30]  Stop it.  Why, suicide.  Aren't you getting turned on?  No, I can't let this happen.  Stop it.  Get away from me.  That's right, suicide.  Stare through my horn-drimmed glasses and into my eyes.  Oh God, it's getting too tight.  That's right.  No, no.  Yes.  Come on, suicide.  Oh my God.  I'm coming. 
[01:38:00]  Oh my sweet suicide.  Now, with you out of the way, this city will finally be under my control.  What the?  What the hell happened here?  Suicide.  Wake up.  Wake up.  It, it.  No, this can't be happening.  It was Jenny Tilia.  She's gonna pay for this.  Stay tuned for an all new adventure of the spectacular suicide.  On the ice roads of Alaska. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, hey man.  Thank you so much for picking me up.  If someone is playing a deadly game.  I gotta tell you, man.  Most people wouldn't have stopped for a stranger.  The good Lord puts different things in one's path every day.  What?  There's always things happening around me ever since I was young.  But not good things, you know.  Oh, I'm scared.  Well, I'm scared.  I'm scared of the dark, too.  But I go out there.  Prepare for the thrill ride of a lifetime. 
[01:39:00]  40,000 Americans a year die on the highways of America.  The Trucker.  I'm the funniest guy in all.  Serious Serious Accents  The O.P. and Anthony Show  Oh, is that a skip?  Not used to hearing skips  Is that a skip? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, the computer does this once in a while  Really?  It's all digital, how does it skip?  I don't get it  Network connection  Ah  How was your Easter, E-Rock?  It was good  Yeah  Worked on the house  Jimmy's multitasking  Someone called Jimmy  Facebook buys Instagram for $1 billion  That's insanity  The CEO himself, I believe, walked away with $400 million in the deal 
[01:40:00]  $400 million he walks away with  $400 million  For an app  Guy comes up with an app  That makes it look like your pictures have been left out in the rain  Is that it? Yeah  Left out in the sun  In the rain  Sun  It does just look water damaged  Yeah, just leave your pictures out in the weather  How the fuck?  For $1 billion  Do you make an app that sells like that?  And then you sit there and go  I could have thought of that  That was Homeless Charlie, sorry  Oh, really?  Bring him up  No, I know 
[01:40:30]  Are we allowed to bring him up?  I don't know where he is  He's out  He asked where we were  We'll see him again  I just hope I was on the air  So have him call the show show  I didn't think of it  Where are we at with him?  I forgot  We're allowed to have him up or something?  We figured that one out?  Yeah  I think  I don't know  I'll check  We just can't play that audio  That's fine  We can have him up  That's just ridiculous  The people that are interviewed on radio  They interview fucking convicted murderers  Yeah, yeah  Exactly  I know  I know  Unbelievable  We can't  Of course we can have him up  No, but we're not allowed to play the audio  The audio, yeah 
[01:41:00]  But we can have him up  Makes no sense  Facebook will never make that $1 billion back  But it's still smart  Says Patrick Moorhead  Haha, Moorhead  Principal analyst  Add more insights and strategy  Who deemed the move defensive  Instagram was the only thing  Challenging Facebook's dominance  In photo sharing  Moorhead says  Oh, really?  Wow  So it's a scummy corporate move 
[01:41:30]  Yep  What did he say?  Why did he do it?  I don't know  I guess  I guess Facebook's photos  I read  But my comprehension sucks  People were, you know  Going to Instagram  Instead  Right  And now they own the whole thing  So who gives a shit, right?  There's a lot of people  Who were leaving Instagram  Yesterday because of this  They're pissed off  And then trying to find something else  Man, we're not doing  Is that true in the end?  Some Facebook thing, man  That ain't true  I don't really use Instagram at all  Facebook sucks now  It's terrible  Some guy is like 
[01:42:00]  Some guy is teasing me  As he has Opium Radio on Instagram  And he says he's holding it for me  One of these things  We've all had to deal with this  So I follow the guy on Twitter  He says, hey man  You know  Send me a message  I'll hand over the password  I'll do the right thing  And then I write him  He doesn't write me back  I'm like, come on  Are you giving it to me or not?  I'll just come up with another name for Instagram  I can't be bothered with this  Yeah  Yeah, I hate when somebody's got your name  If you're a fan of the show  Just give up our names 
[01:42:30]  That we use on all these services  Please  You motherfuckers  I'll have E-Rock put together  A nice package for you  Whatever  A nice package  Of what  Bad swag  That they give away  On Sam's show  You heard that  Well, like  Sometimes tune in  There's Roland laughing  But to the guy  If he's listening  Just let me know either way  Because if you're not  That's fine  I got another name already  On Instagram  You're getting on  Instagram bandwagon now?  Huh?  Now?  Oh yeah  Because I got a Droid  It only became available 
[01:43:00]  For the Droid phones  Well that's true  Last week or two weeks ago  I'm on it but I don't use it  I'd rather use Twitter  I've run out of things  To take pictures of  I've taken a picture of guns  That's all I would take pictures of  Yeah, but I take a lot of pictures though  And you could  You could sync the two  With the Twitter and the Instagram  No, you can't  Yeah, you can  No, you can't  Yeah, you can't  Why are you being difficult?  You can't  You're being difficult  No  Yes, you are  They don't work together  Passwords will  Cause follies  Follies  I really hate how Bob Kelly 
[01:43:30]  Is taking this thing  Like so seriously  It's his art, dude  It is his art, dude  And he's got like his pictures  With his filters on him, dude  You fucking, you know  Take a picture of a building  Here's every  Like Bob Kelly loves doing  Take a picture of a building  From very low  Facing up, you know  And then you just  Put a bunch of filters on it  To  That's it  Like the contrast  And saturation  You super saturate it  Contrast the shit out of it  And then  Fucking post it  He wishes we all took pictures  Of him that way  Oh 
[01:44:00]  Oh  Oh  Dude  Dude  Insta-ham  I'm on Insta-ham, dude  Dude, I look better  In a sepia filter, dude  You know who else  Thinks his Instagram pictures  Are gorgeous?

[01:44:30]  We'll get a Troy update  On his nose job  In a little bit  All right  Why are they pulling  That gentleman's pants off?  It's a viral video today  It's everywhere  What, the assault that happened?  They beat the shit out of a guy  And then they pulled his pants off?  A bunch of black guys  Yeah  And not even just guys  People  Where was this?  Black people  I believe it was in  Where was it?  Fuck  Hold on  The answer will come up  Any second now 
[01:45:00]  Baltimore  It was in Baltimore  And this guy was out  I guess it was St. Paddy's Day  And they were circling like sharks  And one guy was going  Yo, yo  Yo, grab that nigga watch  Yo, grab that nigga watch  And they're trying to get his watch  And when they were trying to rob the guy  He turned around and started following one of the guys  Yeah  And he got blindsided  Side of the head  One of those  One of those typical cheap shots  Knocked his head right on the fucking ground 
[01:45:30]  And then they start kicking him  Stomping him  Ripping his clothes off  And stealing his phone, money  And everything else  If this was a black guy  And a white mob  Came down upon him  And beat him  Regardless if it was actually just a robbery  Or if it was racially  Those people would have been  Hung out to dry  As racists  And whatnot  We say it all the time  And people are starting  People notice it  They just don't report it the same 
[01:46:00]  It's so  Why?  Right  They do not report it the same fucking way  Why do the media expect  Why is this expected behavior  From black people  But not white people?  Wow  Was this caught on  World Star Hip Hop?  Oh, some guy's talking about it  Yo, World Star Hip Hop  Some girl kicks him in the head  Just awful  The guy's just standing there in the street  Yeah  They're dancing  Is this downtown Huntington?  Where are we at?  I don't think so  This is Baltimore 
[01:46:30]  Look at this guy  He's not doing anything wrong  No  He's standing there  And all these fucking people are surrounding him  Putting their hands in his pockets  Yeah, they're trying to rob him  And then he just gets  Oh, man  Some guy just fucking punches him  Knocks him out  So now he's down on the ground  Fucking savages  Smashed his head  Now they're just looking at him  One guy's got a cell phone camera  Right in his face  This is what it's all about  And now they're ripping his clothes off  And robbing him  Not one word  About what we all know is happening 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, exactly  Fucking assholes  Exactly  I mean, that  The whole degradation of the pants down thing  Isn't just a robbery  And by the way  Here's what the media  This is how vomit inducing  Right  I know exactly what you're going to say  The fucking vomit inducing the media is  They're out showing the video to people  Yeah  To get reactions  And they're showing the video on an iPad  To black people  Right  So black people can go  That's terrible  Right  Because they couldn't get the reaction  Out of the fucking mob  Because nobody in the mob  Would say this is disgusting  No 
[01:47:30]  They want to show  Look, black people are nice  Black people care about this too  Yeah, yeah  The fucking media is just  They're killable  Terrible  Terrible  They're terrific  Wow  They give us our news every day  And that isn't mentioned  Race is not mentioned  In news stories  It's amazing  This woman who's  This black female is a cop  I guess  Or she's the sheriff  I don't know what she is  But she's like  That man has the right to go out  Without being  But just a really sanitized way  She describes it  Oh, yeah, yeah  Without it being racial at all  With this fucking 
[01:48:00]  Goddamn woman  She looks like she's 30  With braces on  That's hilarious  They stripped this guy  Stripped him down  Almost naked  And they're all laughing at him  It's not mentioned at all  What we all know happened  Yeah  They just won't mention it  Yeah  They won't say those words  Nope  Stripped and robbed  And boldly more  Yep  Well, CNN  Speaking of the news  Had a reporter  Reading a Facebook post  That was a little salty  Ah  A bit salty  Oh, this is about 
[01:48:30]  I'm going to guess  This is about the  The Tulsa shooting  Okay, so she read  The guy's Facebook  And was in trouble  For actually quoting  Something that's unpleasant  And I guess she apologized  I don't know  I guess they wanted to put  You know, the fucked up thing  With this also  Is they use this  Language  For this story  To show this white guy's  Anger towards black people  But  Where is the multitude  Of black guy posts  That have been  Convicted  Convicted of crimes  That just say 
[01:49:00]  Horrific  Things  About white people  They expect it  It's expected behavior  The media expects blacks  To act that way  So they don't think  It's shocking  You should play the  Try to find  The  I guess it was yesterday  The day before  The new Black Panthers  Put out a  Little statement  About race war  Coming  Yeah  Doesn't anybody  Really listen to them anymore  You know what  The news  Gives them  Time  The news  Gives them  Fucking time  So  You know 
[01:49:30]  It's a video  I think  Yeah that one  Okay just pause it  And then we'll get to it  After this  Yeah  This is CNN right here  And CNN has also  Discovered what police have  There was a Facebook  Posting made  Just the other day  Written by the suspect  In this case  That police are examining  And it reads like this  Today is two years  That my dad has been gone  Shot by  And please excuse the language  It's very sensitive  Shot by a fucking nigger  It's hard not to go off 
[01:50:00]  Between that and Charon  Yeah  That's what it said  If that's the news  You should be able to say that  Yeah  It's just  I mean that's what  It's always funny to hear it  From a middle age  Slash older  Older woman  Nigger  She really did not put  Any fucking  No  Any soul into that  Wow  But that's what the fucking  That's where we're at  She's like reading the quote  Which I think that's a fair thing to read  I like the fact that  She broke down that  That barrier that's been there  Forever 
[01:50:30]  The effing n-word  Yeah  It's like the guy  Went on a killing spree  Because of that  If you're going to read the quote  Read the quote  Read the fucking quote  Frederica  Whitfield said  We apologize to our viewers  For such profanity  Being used on our air  So  Right away she said that  She was a little freaked out  By that  Yeah  So  Right away  When she came back to the studio  She was like  Humna humna  Ed Naughton  And then everyone apologized  In the air  Lots of apologies  Oh here is the anchor  Apologizing  Apologies all around  Susan Candiotti in Tulsa 
[01:51:00]  We apologize to our viewers  For such profanities  And being used  On our air  And we'll be right back  With much more than the intro  We're sorry if anyone was offended  By what that cunt said  Oh wait a minute  We don't however apologize  For showing people being beaten up  And for showing the images  We show of the war  But we are sorry  That she said the F word  And the N word  Back to back  Hope you weren't offended  Yes  Yep  My goodness  Fucking  Idiots 
[01:51:30]  Yeah  But here's something  Now  The new Black Panthers  You can say what you want about them  They're idiots  They're fucking  Well  That wouldn't be the word  You would use  Anthony  No  I would use  Inflammatory  Yes  But  But  They  They were  Talking  Out their asses  About  Whitey  And  Race war  The thing is  They're mentioned on the news  The news talks about  What the Black Panthers  Have said about  The Trayvon case 
[01:52:00]  Racial incidents  Things like that  But  If you listen to some of their  Their rhetoric  You'd kind of be like  You know  If it was white  A white group  The news wouldn't cover it  Like the news doesn't cover  What the Klan says about shit  You know  They cover a Klan  Marching somewhere  You know  If they're going to march somewhere  And  It's  Very  Offensive to people  In the neighborhood  They're marching  But they don't just  Randomly quote  Fucking what they're saying 
[01:52:30]  Listen to some of this clip  It's unbelievably racist  That guy that got busted  It's in NBC  You notice how NBC  Won't even name the editor  Who fucked up in Miami  Of course  It's amazing when it's their own  How they don't  Oh yeah  But that guy is symbolic  Of the entire  Right  Fucking media  The whole problem  He just got caught  Yep  Oh it was a time issue  Now get the fuck  It was so  Obviously blatant  Stop  Just stop  Black power brother Sean  This is Sister Michelle 
[01:53:00]  Chief of Staff  For Tampa  St. Petersburg  Captain of New York  I just want to say  To all the listeners  That's on this  Phone call  If you are having  Any doubts  About getting suited  Booted and armed up  For this race war  That we're in  That has never ended  Let me tell you something  The things that's about  To happen  To these honkies  These cracos  These pigs  These pink people  These motherfucking  Purple people  It has been long  Over  Yeah 
[01:53:30]  But what she said  Was right  We got to suit up  And boot up  We got to suit up  And boot up  It's always a rhyme  Black people love rhyming  And get prepared  For the war that we're in  Where this stuff  Got to boil over  And all your greats  Talked about  There happened to be  Bloodshed  Involved with revolution  True revolution  Means some bloodshed  So there's  Blood being spilled  Because there's a new life  That is beyond  This bloodshed  There's a new reality  That is built upon  Your original  African principles  And spiritual 
[01:54:00]  And values  That is beyond  This bloodshed  But we got to go through it  What American principles  And as they say  You got to cross  We're going to have to cross  The Red Sea  You're going to have to cross  The Red Sea  Time to cut down  The big tree  I know y'all thought  He was talking about  Some sea  Is that what he said  Middle eastern part  Of the world  Hell no  We're talking about  Some blood  You're going to have to  Cross some blood  And go through some blood  And some battles  And there are those  Who wish they could stand 
[01:54:30]  In this hour  To see the destruction  Of the devil's world  And the devil's society  And I ain't talking about  No dude underneath the ground  With a pitchfork  And pantyhose  I'm talking about  That blonde head  Blue eyes  Sometimes brown eyes  Hope he's the devil  We all knew that though  Damn it  I didn't do shit  Not right enough  Goes on forever  Oh yeah  He definitely  It's pretty much that  I mean you really  Don't have to play  The whole thing  To get the gist  Of the fact that 
[01:55:00]  They are  A horrific  Racist organization  Bent on stirring up shit  And boy  If they won a race war  I say bring it  I didn't realize  Wanda Sykes  Was so pissed off  I know  Didn't it sound like Wanda  God Wanda  Damn  She's mad  Yeah  Wanda's mad  Man  But you know what  See that  But they give that  Press  They give that  The news  They might not play that  I haven't heard them  Play that clip  On the news 
[01:55:30]  But they will  Play statements  And say that the  Black Panther organization  Released a statement  Saying that they want  Zimmerman  A bounty on him  Like why give them  Any credence  If you're not going to  Give credence to  Fucking Stormfront  And Aryan Nation  Because they're pigs  Meaning the media  The media's pigs  And it keeps the story going  Black people  When they're mad like that  When something like this happens  They rally  Or they riot  Or they march  Peacefully  They do something  White people don't 
[01:56:00]  So when it's a black on white crime  Like in Baltimore  That's not going to galvanize  Anybody to do anything  No  So it's not interesting  To talk about it like that  But another case  Will  So that  When it's one way  People march  And it keeps the news story going  It's not an ounce of sincerity  In what the media does  Not an ounce of it  No  Alright  No fucking  There's just no credibility anymore  With the news  It's ridiculous  They've lost all credibility 
[01:56:30]  I can't watch the news  And think I'm seeing anything  That's even close to real life  Except for Fox right  Well of course  But  Even Fox  Hey at least they called NBC out  Like  Yeah  At least they did that  Yeah  I think it reaches a point  Where you have to  Yeah  Drudge pretty much  Is trying to fucking  Just balance it  Like  That thing in Baltimore  It's just a beat down  It happens  They didn't murder the guy  Yeah  But just talk about it  The way you would  The other way  That's all I ask  And I  You know what though 
[01:57:00]  I don't  I don't  Look at the crime  And say  Well that was murder  And this was just assault  That guy could have  Easily died  But when they punched him  In the face  His back of the head  Hit the sidewalk  There have been  Lots of people  That have died  Just like that  One punch  Dead  Right  So I don't even look  At the end result  Whether the guy died or not  That's why I hate  These criminals  That get attempted murder  And they serve  Four years  It's like he was  Trying to kill the guy  He had a blatant disregard 
[01:57:30]  For the guy's life  He just fucked up  And didn't kill him  But you know  The intent was there  Anyway  So I don't buy  That whole  Well he's still alive  Thing  They're animals  Those fucking guys  And they're still  Walking around  They haven't been caught  Yeah  Motherfuckers  But they're calling  For a race war  So  When you're 13%  Of the population  You probably should  Really look at your numbers  Before you call out  A race war  That's what I'm thinking  You know  Gotta kind of watch 
[01:58:00]  That whole thing  They gotta suit up  And boot up I think  Or something  You're itching  Itching  You're itching  I'm not itching  I'm a peace loving guy  Are you itching though  A little bit  Nah  A little bit  Nah  A little  If anyone wants to  Bring a fight  I'm there  I mean I will  Participate in the race war  But  But you're not itching  I'm not itching  For it to start  And I certainly  Am not starting a race war  It says poison ivy  I didn't say anything  These guys said it  The Black Panthers 
[01:58:30]  Right  They're the ones saying  They won a race war  So you know  If they  Follow through on this  I'll be glad  Be glad to oblige  As part of the opposition  And you know  Have a little fun with them  Sling a little lead  A little fun  You're the best  It's the best  You know the Instagram thing  Really quickly  We forgot one thing about that  What  The same day  Kodak announces  They're going bankrupt  Isn't that something  That doesn't show you  How the world  Has drastically changed  More pictures than ever 
[01:59:00]  Being taken  And Kodak is going broke  Those idiots  Had the entire market  They couldn't figure out  Where picture taking  Was going  They didn't figure out  They just couldn't figure it out  They depended on  Stupid film  And had nothing in the can  As far as  You know  Moving forward  Could not figure out  Digital  Then a dumb guy  Comes along with an app  Called Instagram  He gets a billion dollars  His company  He gets 400 million  Himself I believe  And Kodak's going bankrupt  Yeah  That's just amazing to me  And they want to give  Fucking 13.5 million 
[01:59:30]  In bonuses  You read that right  Those scumbags  They're asking  The golden parachute  They're asking regulators  If they could pay out  Yeah 13 and a half  Regulators  Dollars worth of bonuses  That's  They're saying  So they can retain their talent  But what talent do they have  If Kodak went  Fucking belly up  Yeah  What talent  What are you talking about  Talent  Your company went bankrupt  None of these idiots  Saw this shit coming down  The pipeline  What does that mean  We don't want to pay our bills  So we want to take  13.5 million  That isn't being paid 
[02:00:00]  Into our fucking bills  And just give it to each other  Yeah how do the stockholders  Feel about that  What piece of shit  The stockholders  Pump money into their company  Lose it all  And then  Some of that money  Goes to guys  Just getting paid off  How about you split  That 13.5 million  Over the stockholders  You shitty company  What a giant  What a giant  Mismanagement  And just  A lack of vision  To see the digital age  Coming  And concentrating  Like no  We'll  We're still be  We'll be the film people  They refuse to acknowledge  That digital is anything  When we all were thinking 
[02:00:30]  Wait a minute  I don't have to fucking  Get these pictures  Developed anymore  Of course that's  The better way to do it  Very hard to compete  With Japan though  When it's all  Electronic media  When you're talking  You know  Digital pictures  Digital cameras  Things like that  Japan pumps out  Newer models  Better  Cameras and what not  Kodak I don't think  Could have kept up anyway  So you don't think  They  Okay yeah  You just said  What I was  Yeah  I think  But they should have  Tried  I mean  You know  Or maybe  So they had to  Depend on film  You think  For their livelihood 
[02:01:00]  Or get in a partnership  With a Japanese company  Or something  That would have  Kept them afloat  With the technology  That was coming in  But they were like  No film  Film  People still drive up  To photomats  In the supermarket  Parking lot  What  Photomat  It worries me  Because I have  A soft spot  For Rochester  New York  I've spent a lot  Of time up there  Between college  And radio  And stuff  And they depend  On Kodak  Bosch and Lomb  Oh  And Xerox  Oh boy  And Xerox sucks too now  Yeah you're pretty much  That whole technology  Is fucking antiquated  Well you could do 
[02:01:30]  A lot of your own  Stuff at home  With your printer  Right  So two out of the three  I would assume  Are in deep trouble  Yeah  And then the Bosch and Lomb  I mean a lot of people  Are getting the LASIK  So  Oh right  For lenses and what not  So I don't know  What happens to a city  Like Rochester  Without a  Without a Kodak  Yeah  And a Xerox  But what a weird day  To see Instagram  Getting a billion  And Kodak going  Fucking bankrupt  Well the times  Are a change  Who's the Kodak song  There was 
[02:02:00]  True Colors  By  Cindy Lauper  Of the true colors  Shining through  Shut up  Does it remember  The times of your life  Oh that was  Paul Anka  Do you remember  Do you remember  The times of your life  Yeah that was like  A big one from  The child of the 80s  Or maybe 70s  Hey I love how we just talk  And we think we know shit  Yeah  We're so wrong  On this Kodak thing  What happened  Go ahead Steve in Texas  Yeah I heard on the news 
[02:02:30]  About three or four months ago  When they were talking  About them going bankrupt  That they invented  Digital photography  And have the patents  And that's what's  Kept them floating  Really  Then how come  They're going broke  Yeah if they have the patents  I can't imagine  How they would go broke  I'm not sure they have the patents  But I guess  I guess they're idiots  Okay then they're idiots  Fair enough  But just FYI  They did  Apparently have decided  What does that mean  I don't pronounce the I

Hey, this is Brett Michaels of Poison.  Hey, this is Danny McBride.  This is Jesse Ventura.  Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon.  Hey, this is Michael Chiklis.  Hey, this is Pee Wee Herman.  Hey, this is Seth Green.  Hey, this is Steve-O, and you're listening to the Opie and Andy Show. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, what did I say?  Oh, did I?  All right.  Opie and Anthony Show?  Chris Elliott making his way down the hall.  Chris Elliott on our show.  From, uh...  Yeah, I know him from Letterman, of course.  From when we were growing up.  No joke.  I mean, he goes way back with Letterman.  You know Letterman's going to be 65 this year?  Longest running host in history.  They got a big article on him turning 65 in the paper today. 
[02:25:30]  Wow.  I'm not sure when his birthday is, but...  The big 6-5 for Letterman.  Chris Elliott, first time on our show.  There he is.  What's up, Chris?  Good.  How you doing?  Welcome to the program.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton.  And the wonderful James Norton.  Jimmy Norton.  We were just talking about Letterman because there's a huge article in the paper today  that he's turning 65.  Yeah.  Damn.  On the 12th, right?  On the 12th, is it?  Yeah, yeah.  You better remember.  So a couple days.  I know.  I got to send him something. 
[02:26:00]  I got to send him something.  But he probably shaves a few years off that.  You think?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you think he's more than 65?  He's been doing this for a while.  He's got to be like 70 at this point.  In his 70s.  Doesn't everybody shave off a few?  I probably should.  I don't, but I probably should.  I try to shave a few.  It doesn't work after a while.  After a while, it doesn't work.  Chris, it doesn't work after a while.  It's right.  Because then people come up to you and go, fuck, you look like shit.  Yeah, after a while.  And then you give them your real age, like, no, no, I'm really this old. 
[02:26:30]  I actually think when people get plastic surgery, that that's the best way to hide your age.  Not because you look younger, but because you just can't tell at that point where their age is.  Yeah, it just becomes a mess.  Yeah, it's just this ugly, stretched thing.  It's a distraction.  Like, they don't even care what your real age is anymore.  They say, what did you used to look like?  Who's the worst?  Kenny Rogers?  You don't see a lot of guys getting the over-the-top plastic surgery.  I got it.  Kenny Rogers is brutal.  Yeah, he doesn't look like him anymore.  Kenny Rogers is really awful.  Joan Rivers is pretty bad.  Yeah, but, I mean, you expect that. 
[02:27:00]  A lot of females get the top.  But Joan Rivers, actually, I think on TV, like some people just on TV, it looks horrible.  I think she actually looks good on TV.  I was on a plane with her once, and up close, it's like, you know, ah, but like on TV, it's  like, oh, yeah, okay, it passes.  It's like those hair replacement things, too, look good, like on TV.  On TV.  On TV.  Yeah, but if you're, like, sitting next to the guy, you can see exactly what's going on.  Who do you think's a horror show?  In terms of the facial stuff?  Yeah.  Well, that cat woman, for sure, whatever. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, Wildenstein was the name.  Yeah.  But she looked kind of weird before she even started doing stuff, too.  She had, like, a big, looked like an African tribal mask.  Yeah.  That she had on.  Yeah.  That was strange.  But, I mean.  Who is she?  She's like a, just a, you know.  Socialite.  Socialite.  Oh, right.  One of those famous for nothing people.  New York socialites that made all the media with her looks.  She tried to make herself look like a cat for a while there.  I'm scared that I, at some point, will think, oh, I should get plastic surgery. 
[02:28:00]  I should get a little something done.  Just a lift or a little tuck or something.  And then.  You look good in person.  Yeah.  You look good.  Thank you very much.  You look like shit on TV.  But in person.  So you go the other way.  I do.  But that's, you know, that's part of my charm.  Looking like shit.  I don't even know Chris Elliott.  I'm taking shots.  What was your first Letterman?  What year?  It was on the first show of Letterman.  Wow.  Yeah.  Which was, I don't know what.  I think 81 or 82.  I want to say 82. 
[02:28:30]  Damn.  Yeah.  Wow.  You were on Letterman's first show?  I was on the first late night, not the first morning show.  It was, they were doing a tour of the studio and they came into the control room and there  was an Oktoberfest going on in the control room.  And I was in lederhosen and drinking a beer.  But that was the first time.  But the first time I talked, I, and it's true, I was playing garbage.  Which I always like to point out. 
[02:29:00]  That was my start in show business was I got to come out and it was an urban disguise for  New York City.  And it was like, you know, if you want to be safe in the city, here's an urban disguise.  Oh, like camouflage kind of thing, right.  Yeah.  And it was a total garbage suit.  And I came out and my whole face was covered in garbage.  I just, and I didn't say anything.  I just, I just modeled.  And then, then I, that night when the show was broadcast out on the East Coast, as soon  as I came out, for some reason, the show was blacked out.  And the tape operator down on two or whatever pushed the run button. 
[02:29:30]  And by the time he pushed the right button, I was gone.  Oh man.  So you were waiting.  So I, you know, I had told everybody to watch and then, but Dave had me on the next night  in the same, you know, outfit, except you could see my face and, and, uh, and he asked  me, you know, how I felt and I said, I was devastated.  And I got a couple of laughs off that.  He asked me what people in the audience had told me.  And I said that they had said it was the funniest thing they'd seen in North America.  And he, and he laughed at that.  And, and, uh, that was, that was the first time that I, you know, said anything on the 
[02:30:00]  show.  But how did you get involved, uh, originally?  Um, what put you in that control room for that?  Uh, I, I got, I was hired as a runner on the show.  I was hired.  I had, I had worked at PBS as a production assistant and I met, there was like a writer  strike going on.  Sounds exciting.  Yeah.  It was really exciting for a show with Hotting Carter.  Uh, and, uh, you.  They, they, I met the, uh, guy who had, um, been associate producer on Dave's morning  show.  It was moonlighting over at PBS. 
[02:30:30]  And he told me about this new show that was starting up and there was this job for a  graphics coordinator where I would just, you know, find photos and stuff off AP.  And I thought, oh, that's going to be a step up from, from, uh, what I was doing.  And I actually quit my job at PBS cause I, he was, it was pretty sure I was going to get  this job.  And I went over for my interview and Barry Sand, who was the producer at the time said  that that job had been taken already and that all they had was a, uh, a runner for 200 bucks  a week, which was less than what I was getting at PBS. 
[02:31:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  You had the best skits too, man.  Oh, thanks, man.  That's nice.  No, I'm serious.  I mean, there were great writers back then too.  And, and still are, you know, I still think it's like the fun show in here.  Kind of ahead of your time too.  I think people weren't doing outrageous stuff, but I mean, people had done weird shit like  that on, you know, Steve Allen, stuff like that.  There were always guys like doing, but I always felt like you took it to the next level though.  I was trying to do, that's really nice.  I mean, I was always, the joke with me was always that I'm this, you know, staff member 
[02:31:30]  who's desperate, desperately wants to be on television and be a star, but he's not particularly  talented.  Right.  And, and there was a lot of truth to that.  That is exactly what I was on that show.  So, you know, I was just this guy trying really hard every day to get, you know, my  face scene.  And Dave, you know, right from the start, he thought, you know, I was this goofy guy  and just like put me on the air.  That's pretty good.  So he liked you for early on, yeah.  He did.  But, you know, it was an early, it was, it was a small group of people back then when  the show first started, you know, it was just like a, it was a real like skeleton  crew of people.  So it was easy to get some face time with him. 
[02:32:00]  It's a lot harder now, but you know, he, he took a liking to me right away.  He's a very private guy, huh?  Very, very private.  And you just don't know much about him except, you know, every once in a while he gets a  headline.  Yeah.  Something will pop.  But besides that, you don't really know what, what he's about.  But, and he's gotten more and more so, you know, but I guess like Carson was sort of  that way too, for sure.  You know, who he idolizes.  Yeah.  You know, it's like kind of the same thing.  Did you ever do Carson?  I did it when Jay hosted once.  Oh, okay.  And I did it, uh, never, not when, but when it was the Johnny's tonight show, but he wasn't 
[02:32:30]  there.  Aw.  Yeah.  I never did it with, uh, I was kind of like doing the view without Barbara Walter.  Yeah.  You kind of would want to like, you were on Carson, you know, I kind of want Carson to  be there.  I know.  Yeah.  Cause that, that's, that's, he did, we did, uh, uh, you know, some shows at late night  out in, I remember we went and we traveled out to Burbank, did some shows at NBC there  and Carson was a guest on the show.  And I just remember just the, the feel in our studio, which was just thrown together 
[02:33:00]  for us when he was like near, it wasn't even like he was there yet.  You just knew, oh, this presence is, you know, about to come in and, uh, uh, it, it, you  know, that King shit sort of aura, you know, it's something I think Dave actually, you  know, has himself.  So, oh, so when you guys went out there, Dave had him as a guest on the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty awesome.  It was awesome.  It was pretty cool.  He's one guy I never met.  I wished I had. 
[02:33:30]  I mean, uh, there was, you always heard good stories and you heard bad stories about Carson.  I heard he was really tough to get to know.  And I've also heard he was really great with, but when you watch him interview people, it's  like, you don't realize that people told him in advance what to talk about.  Like he would ask questions.  You'd be like, how the fuck did he know that?  But you never thought.  Right.  How did he know that they were in Aruba?  Right.  Like it was such a natural.  No, it's sort of like J.  Edgar Hoover, like a guy like that just sort of knew everything about you.  You have that feel.  And I sort of get that with Dave too.  It's just like, you know, and Dave is, and Dave doesn't, the thing about Dave is he's 
[02:34:00]  like, he's so great with comedians.  He does not want a comedian to bomb.  He doesn't want a comedian to fall.  He, if, if a joke, you know, lays there, he has a way of just like picking it up and keep,  and, and, and he can sense that it's not going to work almost.  And he's already right on top of it with, you know, but anyway, what I was going to ask  you about, it's pretty amazing to watch him.  Yeah.  That's what keeps things moving and sort of, uh, yeah.  Cause I've done, you know, all the guys and they're all great, but the, that's one thing  that is amazing that he does that, you know, you always know you're going to be taken care 
[02:34:30]  of there.  Have you had any appearances that you wished were better over the years?  On Dave?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Just about every fucking time I got on the show.  No, I'm pretty hard on myself.  I mean, I'm never happy with any of the stuff that I do, but there, there've been plenty  of times I used to do, uh, Brando on the show, Marlon Brando.  And I can remember, Dave like had a thing, especially back then about any kind of pause,  you know, any kind of, if you were, you know, not filling it with a laugh or, or a joke. 
[02:35:00]  And I can remember him actually giving me the hurry up signal under the desk while I  was acting as Brando.  Oh, that's bad.  But he, I mean, in general, it was always, it always seemed to work.  He always seemed to get something out of, you know, make something work.  But, uh, I, I, yeah, there were plenty of things that I've tried that just bond.  Horribly.  But with me, you know, half the time the audience isn't laughing.  Half the time they're just kind of like scratching their heads and just saying, what the fuck  is he doing?  Yeah.  And that's sort of part of it, I guess. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I think so.  A lot of people are bringing up their favorite moments.  Oh, that's nice.  They want to know if you ate the dog food.  You know what it was?  Yeah.  It was, uh, cold corned beef hash.  It wasn't dog food.  Whenever I eat this shit on, on shows, I, the, the prop people think that they're going  to do me a favor by finding stuff that tastes better than the actual shit that I have to  eat.  And I just did Conan and I, I drank, uh, I said I needed some Jack Daniels and I pulled  out and accidentally I got in Jack Daniels barbecue sauce and I, and I, and I had to gulp 
[02:36:00]  it down and the, you know, the prop people thought, okay, well, we'll get him something  he can swallow.  And they got me, uh, V8 juice mixed with black dye and that's what I had to like, and I seriously  would have preferred the, the, uh, barbecue sauce.  I could have done that, but that was, yeah, that was a corned beef hash.  And then when I drank a peanut oil, that was, uh, that was actually apple cider, which sounds  okay, except I had to do it several times and had diarrhea for like a week afterwards. 
[02:36:30]  Can you do spicy stuff?  Oh, I, you know, if that was spicy, I could do that.  I can do, I love spicy stuff.  What's the spicy?  There's a pepper where they'll, they'll get, there's some place that gives you $50,000.  It's the ghost pepper.  If you could, I don't know the name, but there's a place that will give you 50 grand if you can  finish the sandwich.  It's the ghost.  I think that's what it's called.  The ghost pepper.  I watched that show that, uh, that guy who tries to eat these huge things on food.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  The guy goes to those restaurants and he's always like, have you noticed though that he doesn't 
[02:37:00]  do that anymore?  It's like he stopped, like he got too many, yeah, he either went to his doctor or too many  complaints from viewers saying this guy's going to die on camera because now it's like, it's  like, uh, he has other, he has a team of people trying to eat the biggest hamburger.  It's not him anymore.  I saw him once eating a steak, like a giant, one of those giant frigging pieces of cow.  And he was actually, he goes, Oh, I'm getting the meat sweats.  You get meat.  It's like, you can't, that can never be, never be good for you.  You've never had the meat sweats. 
[02:37:30]  No.  I've had the meat sweats.  It's like so much sodium and shit.  Go to the Brazilian steakhouse.  You'll get the meat sweats.  I'm telling you.  Meat sweats.  Does, it sounds like something that happens right before you die.  Yeah.  He had the meat sweats and that's the last, that's when your kidney fails or the meat sweats.  Yeah.  Organ failure.  Vital organ failure follows meat sweats.  I've never sweat from eating too much meat or something.  Oh, it's brutal.  I mean, do you smell like, is that sweat like sort of meaty?  We would think it's a meaty gravy, like sweat that's coming out of you. 
[02:38:00]  Reddish.  Yeah.  Blood.  Like the blood when you push down out with a fork.  It's probably more, it is probably more the salt.  It's like, when you eat too much pizza, you get that.  But you get like the back of your neck, every crank in your neck is just fucking sweaty  and almost itchy.  Well, I've gone on that protein diet a few times, which actually works.  It actually works for me.  The Atkins.  The Atkins thing.  But actually, I go on one that's, they actually have it for like obese people, I think, for  surgery.  The Hoyt accident.  It's basically the Atkins diet. 
[02:38:30]  But it's like, you know, a couple of fried eggs and bacon, you know, for breakfast and,  you know, a hunk of steak for lunch and, you know, as much chicken as you want for  dinner, you know, and I, I like go crazy the first like, you know, week on that.  I'm just like having, I'm buying like the biggest ice cream steaks that you can possibly  imagine.  And I, but it actually, it's, it's work, but you do like start to feel like a little like  woozy after a few days.  My buddy, Adam, Adam Ferrara, he, he was on that for a while and, uh, literally passed 
[02:39:00]  out once.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's something that you can't just eat protein.  Right.  You need some other shit.  Some carbs are healthy.  You just can't fucking eat.  You just can't eat an abundance.  Right.  I, that was my way of saying everything in moderation without being a total douchebag.  You sounded like grandma right there.  You know, you're not in abundance.  Yes.  Can't you have one or two pieces of bread?  Yeah.  I really am a fucking douche.  It's a health show.  You should have one.  Yeah. 
[02:39:30]  Everything in moderation.  From your mouth to God's ears.  I should just shut the fuck up.  On the plane last night, I'm like, they're like, do you want fruit or do you want the  chicken?  I'm like, can I have both?  I had the fucking cheese.  What a pig I was on the plane.  Were you in first class?  Of course.  Yeah.  Well, you know what they say.  If it's a 30,000 feet, you're not really eating.  Right.  First class food sucks now.  It's not any better than what they used to give in coach, which now is a box that you 
[02:40:00]  pay for.  I'll actually get those meals sometimes.  I'll actually pay for the box meals.  Can you do that?  Yes.  I was actually thinking that the other day.  I was, of course, also in first.  But they said, you know, what the meal was going to be.  And I was like, oh, fuck.  Can I just, like, give them 10 bucks and get a turkey wrap or whatever the hell is the  poor people are eating?  Well, on Continental, Continental now United, they have the tapas box.  T-A-P-P-A-S.  And it's a little box you open and it's got, like, fucking hummus and a couple of other  little crackers.  Tapas sucks.  No, but that's just the name of it.  I don't get that.  It's a little bite of everything. 
[02:40:30]  It's like, how about just give me one of these meals?  Oh, is that what that is?  Yeah.  Tapas means a little sample.  Oh.  It's good to hear you say that because that's, like, one of the things that people say,  yeah, it's a tapas bar.  And I'm just like, ugh.  I don't want to go there.  I don't want to sit and have.  And it's like, I don't like also, like, a chef's taster's menu or something at a restaurant  where you just have to sit there and let them bring out the, you know, the.  Yeah, how do you know what I want?  Stop.  Yeah.  And I don't like sharing.  No, I don't like that either.  I like getting my own stuff.  I'm not a share.  I don't like share. 
[02:41:00]  Get this for the table.  No.  It's always, you want to try.  That means you want to try mine.  No.  We don't share.  You don't like family style.  No.  That's family style.  It's funny.  I can just see this conversation.  Like, you fast forward five minutes.  I don't like Jews.  And God damn it, I don't like AIDS.  It just gets itself seriously.  Well, we don't even get spin out of control with this shit so easily.  Well, we would have just went there, but we don't know you yet.  So we figured we'd soften it up a little bit.  Well, I would, like, actually surprise how soft everything is so far.  We haven't, like, gotten into it yet. 
[02:41:30]  No, that's for sure.  And Jimmy kind of started things rolling right there.  But, yeah.  I just want to acknowledge, you know, Chris Elliott's father is Bob from Bob and Ray.  That's right.  And your freaking daughter's on SNL.  My freaking daughter's on SNL.  And my other one's doing stand-up.  And has a really funny Twitter thing that she does that she's getting noticed on.  Do you like that your daughter does stand-up?  It's so beyond my realm of understanding anything with her.  She's so, she's so, she was always so shy. 
[02:42:00]  She actually, Abby was always, like, really out there and really, you know, like, we always knew, okay, she's going to go into it.  Bridie was always really, really shy.  More like me, actually, when I was a kid.  So I don't know.  It might just be her way.  It's like going in a shark cage and seeing a shark.  It's her way of just facing demons and whatever.  But she's really, really funny when she does it.  And her Twitter stuff is.  What's her Twitter?  We'll get her some followers today.  It's at Bridie Lee.  How do you spell that?  B-R-I-D-E-Y-L-E-E. 
[02:42:30]  And it's, you know, I don't do Twitter.  But I'm amazed when I look at it.  You'd be good at it.  I guess I would.  I just, it seems like work to me.  Oh, right.  You're writing.  No, but it doesn't.  Yeah, I'm writing.  I mean, you guys do it.  I know.  But it's like, to me, it just seems like, oh, shit, I got to get up and think of something  funny for people to see.  Mine just be grayed into drunken racism.  Nice.  Fucking rat.  You know, if they were white.  Well, I mean, it's sort of like, for me, the same reason I wouldn't want a gun around  the house, too.  It's just like, if I had a few to drink, you know, I might get on that Twitter thing and 
[02:43:00]  start, you know, talking about my old high school buddies, you know.  I'm starting to realize there's no point to Twitter.  What is this?  There's no end game.  There's no end game?  What's the payoff?  I think people are going to be ripping off your jokes, so what's the payoff?  People are going to be doing their final tweet on their deathbed.  But everybody, like, says, you know, oh, you've got to do it, and I'm like...  You should do it.  I know.  Twitter needs a quiz.  You would be good, yeah.  I just don't know that I can do it on my Motorola flip phone.  Well, yeah. 
[02:43:30]  I got something.  We got a Razor?  I have the old Razor.  You don't feel like you need an iPhone or a droid?  I do, actually.  I do.  I do feel that now.  All right.  Twitter's good, I think, to promote stuff, but you can't just promote on it because it  turns people off.  But it's fine because you get an immediate reaction.  If there's something you want to talk about, instead of calling the one dumb friend, you  can just blast it out there, and you kind of feel like you get it off your chest.  It's satisfying.  Well, how do you promote something without sounding like a dick on it?  Like, you know, watch me tonight on, you know, that's just...  I think people will give you a little of that.  They'll give you a little of that. 
[02:44:00]  They'll give you a little of that, sure.  They'll give you a little of that, as long as it's not...  As long as that's not all you're doing with your Twitter.  Because they want to know what you're doing.  That's the difference, I think.  As long as it's...  To be honest, that's the only reason I would do it.  No, but I mean, I've got, like, a book in the fall, and they're saying, oh, well, you're  going to have to be on Twitter for that.  And I'm like, well, I don't, you know, doing little excerpts, I don't know what I'm supposed  to be doing on it.  When people follow you, and you're making them laugh, once in a while, you throw out  a plug.  They're cool, because they want to know about your book.  But guys that overdo plugs, fucking stink. 
[02:44:30]  Right.  Every time you read, it's like, hey, catch my show.  You're like, ugh.  Right.  Why?  You're not entertaining here.  Why would I go see you there?  So there's a balance, you know.  And you want to pick it up more fans that way, because people retweet you, and if it's good,  then people follow you.  And they wind up liking your shit.  Yeah.  I guess I got to get with it.  We should at least mention why you're here.  Yeah, that would help.  I know.  Chris has done so much stuff with his career.  Eagle Heart.  It's season two premieres Thursday.  It's on midnight.  It's at midnight.  It's on the Cartoon Network.  It's a part of Adult Swim. 
[02:45:00]  And how long have they been in existence?  Because they're doing really, really well.  I don't know how long Adult Swim's been in existence, actually, or the Cartoon Network.  I would say at least 10 years.  I actually did not even know where to find them until I was doing a show on their network.  But they're doing well.  I mean, the Adult Swim end of it is, you know, is live action, you know, stuff at, I guess,  10 o'clock or something.  They switch over to that.  So this is a live action show.  And it's actually, it's the funniest thing I think I've done since Get a Life.  So I'm pretty happy with it.  And people loved Get a Life.  And people still love Get a Life.  Absolutely. 
[02:45:30]  And who do you play on this?  What exactly is this?  You play a U.S. Marshal, but there's no, I mean, it's basically, that's just a reason  to put me on, you know, have me doing a job.  And it's me and Brett Gelman, who's a funny actor, and Maria Thayer, and we're marshals.  But it's a real surreal, very violent show.  And it's only 15 minutes long, so you don't have to sit through a lot of shit.  That's great that they do stuff like that.  It's just a weird time, weird length for a show.  Well, that's kind of like the way old TV used to be.  I mean, you know, my dad actually had an old, you know, he had like a 15-minute TV show, 
[02:46:00]  you know, back in the late 40s, early 50s.  They did that kind of stuff, you know, and they don't do it anymore on networks.  And it's, I think it's actually really cool.  And it's, for me, it's perfect, because it is sort of, it's a little bit longer than the  kind of bits I used to do at Letterman, you know, so it fits pretty well for me.  Can they extend your show if you ever want to do, like, a 25-minute show, or are they  married to 15?  You know, we've actually tried a couple of times to, like, get it to 16 minutes, because  it was really hard to lose, like, you know, a really cute look of mine or something. 
[02:46:30]  But, no, they're pretty much, I mean, I think the show moves so fucking fast.  It's like, you have to watch this show, you have to just stare at the monitor, the TV,  the whole time you're watching.  If somebody comes in and asks you a question, you know, you've got to say, you missed something.  You miss a whole plot point.  And so, I think if you had it a half an hour, you'd have to slow it down, and it wouldn't  be the same kind of show.  I think half the laughs are because it moves so fast.  The fact that it's moving so quickly. 
[02:47:00]  Are there commercials during it, or no?  No, the commercials are all at the end.  It's actually, I think, an 11-minute show.  An 11-minute show?  Yeah, I think, ultimately, that's what it is, but you watch it straight through.  It would be great if we came in here for 11 minutes and went home.  It would be fucking exhausting.  I know.  It would only be seven minutes of filler.  If you do a show like that, when you write a show like that, you don't write the same  way as you would write a half hour.  Do you write for a beginning, a middle, and an end in 11 minutes?  Yeah.  I mean, I'm only consulting on this. 
[02:47:30]  I'm not even writing it because I didn't want to have to be there in the meetings and  do extra work.  But they, yeah, they basically write it.  It doesn't have any, like, most half-hour shows have a B story.  They usually have the secondary character story or something going on.  It doesn't have that.  It can't because there just isn't enough time.  Sometimes those are great, and sometimes there's too many forced interactions.  Like, you don't want to have the interaction, but you kind of have to because you have the  B story, and the A story will sometimes suffer if it's really interesting.  Yeah.  I mean, do you watch a lot of TV?  Do you watch a lot of...  Not anymore.  I used to.  I was still here with all the family and all those great shows, but not anymore. 
[02:48:00]  I mean, I haven't seen a lot of...  Not a lot of...  Just not a lot of good stuff.  No.  Well, it's weird.  It's like, you know, I can't watch TV, you know, comedies on TV, just because it sort  of feels like it's work, or it's, you know, it sort of feels like that's the world I fly  out to L.A. to, you know, work in.  And most of them are terrible.  And a lot of them are terrible.  I do watch...  What's one you like?  Comedy-wise?  And again, it's only... 
[02:48:30]  I've only seen it every now and then.  It's like Parks and Rec actually does make me laugh when I've watched it.  And a lot of times it's on a plane, you know, that I'll be watching it going out there.  But that one makes me laugh.  You know, I do...  I've been doing How I Met Your Mother, and I...  You know, it's written by former Letterman writers, and I think there's some really funny  stuff going on that show, too.  But I don't really...  I don't watch any of them, you know, regularly.  I actually think Everybody Loves Raymond was like the last sort of show in that kind of 
[02:49:00]  All in the Family genre, you know, that was just kind of just straight out like a one-act  play, like All in the Family was.  You know, that took place like in the living room, you know, in front of an audience, and  you just sat there and watched it, you know, for the whole 20 minutes or whatever.  They didn't have B-stories in All in the Family, really, did they?  No.  No.  It was...  But they rehearsed that thing and had the timing down to the point where you were.  You were just watching like a little play.  Mm-hmm.  But I watch mostly, you know, like HGTV and, you know, that History Channel and that kind 
[02:49:30]  of stuff.  Yeah, I find my attention span for like reading stinks now, and I can watch TV shows, but  unless I'm in...  Like, I like Game of Thrones, and I actually like Boardwalk Empire, but I can't even get  into that many long shows.  That's why these 15-minute shows, I think you're going to start seeing more of them,  because we are losing our attention span.  It's true.  It's true.  And also just, like, even though when I'm watching those documentaries, like I'll watch, you know,  like World War II documentaries, or I'm a, you know, a Hitler fanatic for that kind of 
[02:50:00]  shit.  I watch those all the time.  But I don't retain it.  Like, you know, a year, a week later, I'm trying to think, okay, well, what, what exactly  happened there?  And what was that?  And I have to...  He was wrong.  Why?  Yeah.  I have to watch it again to, you know, and I realize my retention, you know, abilities  are really bad now at this point in my life.  Maybe it's my age.  I don't know.  Well, it's also because we're getting so much information.  It's like you get so much.  Your brain has to make quick decisions on what to keep. 
[02:50:30]  And you're like, oh, it's like, you know, oh, yeah, that's right.  There's an open sword.  Don't fuck that person.  That's something the brain will keep forever.  Also, we're lazy.  We don't have to remember anything anymore.  Right.  We talk on this show all the time.  You used to have to know people's phone numbers and all this shit that you don't need to anymore.  Yeah.  You don't really have to memorize anything.  You know, or, yeah.  It's all on your phone.  And you can fucking just look it right up or, you know, what do you do?  Google?  So I think that part of our brain is just fucking lazy.  And who said that Google will anticipate what we want, so we won't even have to remember it. 
[02:51:00]  That could be scary.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's slow down that technology, please.  Can you imagine?  Yeah.  I'm constantly looking up transmissions by accident.  Oops.  But, yeah, that is something that, you know, that whole thing, that's shit that, like,  I did not have to deal with when I was doing what, like, Abby's doing, what Bridie's starting out to do, you know,  and, you know, is having, like, just this, this, the whole world just commenting on your shit afterwards, right away. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  I mean, while it's happening, practically.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's, I don't, I don't, you know, I know it happens to me now when I'm doing stuff, but I don't really, you know,  I'm not that into it, so I don't, like, go right away and see, oh, what's.  You had to search out a review in a paper or a magazine back then.  Yeah, exactly.  And it was a big deal.  It was a big deal to, like, wait until that thing came out, you know, and, you know, oh, okay, when that comes out,  everything is going to, you know, roll after that, but.  Did you ever read a devastating review about yourself? 
[02:52:00]  Well, I'm just.  I mean, I don't know.  I like devastating.  But, I mean, that really got to him, or do you, because some guys don't give a shit that much.  Where you've never recovered.  I think, like, when Cabin Boy came out, that was when the most devastating reviews came out, you know.  And I think there was something that just said, you know, like, well, at least the trailer was funny.  You know, and that kind of thing, like, hurt me.  But, in general, I've never, you know, been a particular darling of anybody's reviews.  What's your thoughts on Cabin Boy? 
[02:52:30]  Because that is a movie.  I stand by that movie.  I think it's a funny movie.  It's bizarre.  It's weird.  But it was supposed to be.  It was supposed to be what it is, you know, just a weird little movie.  And it is little.  It's only, like, 88 minutes long.  But, you know, it's a flawed movie, for sure.  It's not a perfect movie.  But, you know, I watch it every now and then.  It's on, you know, cable.  And I'll watch it.  I think it looks pretty freaky.  And it moves.  And it's, you know.  Does it have its cult following?  It does have a cult following now. 
[02:53:00]  Which, you know, is great.  You know, I think at the time it just was like, you know, it was a Tim Burton-produced thing.  A touchstone Disney.  And it got this big release for some reason.  And it shouldn't have.  I think it should have just been this small movie that people tried to find.  Kind of found on their own.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I don't regret it.  I regret a little bit that I was so stupid.  I didn't realize, oh, well, if that one bombs, I'll just do another one.  You know, it didn't occur to me that, oh, no, that's not how it works. 
[02:53:30]  If your movie bombs, you're not handed another movie to do.  What was that movie where you had this fucked-up hand?  That was a scary movie, too.  Oh, right.  That was so disgusting.  That was pretty gross.  Yeah.  But it was hilarious.  Like, yeah, you're getting into everybody's food with your disgusting hand.  I felt bad about that afterwards.  And I did actually, like a year later, go through a McDonald's drive-thru.  And the girl there recognized me.  And she said she's a big fan and handed me her coffee with a really small hand. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, shit.  I felt, oh, God, I hope she didn't see that.  She got to think that, yeah.  I know.  Unless maybe she did and thought it was funny.  Thought it was funny.  I think you felt bad because she touched your coffee with that little fucking thing on  the end of her wrist.  I didn't drink it.  I said, thank you very much and went to Burger King.  Don't forget about the love blisters from Something About Mary, too.  Yeah, yeah.  The love blisters.  Yeah, that was actually, well, the rash, I guess, was my, it is. 
[02:54:30]  And that thing's like.  I love that movie.  That movie still holds up.  It's not like dated.  Like, you watch it and it's still, like, funny from beginning to end.  Yeah.  And it was really funny on, the script was really funny for that movie.  Because they weren't afraid to be mean, or would be perceived as mean, which is great.  I mean, sometimes humor is, and when you allow that to happen, it's fucking hilarious.  I feel like comedies are finally coming back.  We had a, I don't know, what do you want to say, like a 10-year period?  What's coming with what?  What's bringing?  I don't know.  I mean, even like Hangover and Bridesmaids. 
[02:55:00]  And, you know, the more I watch Bridesmaids, I love it.  Right.  Right.  And people have to say, well, it's a funny movie for women.  It's just a funny movie.  You know, they, like, try to, like, lower the level on that.  Yeah.  I mean, I guess it's like Judd Apatow is sort of, you know.  The Apatow stuff.  The Apatow stuff has kind of taken, you know, what the Farrelly's had done, you know.  Right.  But the Farrelly's, and I've said this before, they probably hate me for saying it.  I thought they had sort of, like, reinvented kind of what Mel Brooks had sort of done, too. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, yeah.  You know, blazing saddles to a degree.  You know, and so, yeah, you're right.  It probably just comes in these blocks or phases where somebody comes in and suddenly is, you know, doing something different.  Something about Mary was different.  Nobody had seen that kind of comedy.  She'd have loaded her hair.  Yeah.  Fucking great.  But also just having those guys singing, you know, in between, you know, bits, you know, in the trees and stuff.  What were those guys again?  That was, uh.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  I couldn't tell you. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, whatever.  They were great, though.  We always talk about the 70s comedies where they just felt like not finishing them.  Right.  Like blazing saddles.  They just decide not to finish the movie.  Or the ending was so stupid.  That's what I mean by not finishing it.  It's like, let's just do this and get out of here.  Caddyshack.  Caddyshack is the same thing.  Same thing, a movie we all love.  But the end of that movie is ridiculous.  I'm still like Young Frankenstein whenever that's on.  I can watch that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's still just like it.  Also, it's just a really pretty movie to watch.  Yeah, yeah.  It's, like, cool to look at.  It looks good.  The music's cool in it.  Loved Mel Brooks growing up.  Loved his movies.  Terry Garr is unbelievable. 
[02:56:30]  I'm hearing you have to go.  He's a busy man.  No, we're not just saying that.  Sometimes we do say that to get people out of here.  No, seriously.  I'm sorry if I do.  See that chubby guy right there?  Rolling on his phone.  He's panicking.  Rolling gets all freaked out.  Did we do the show justice?  I don't know.  It's called Eagle Hearts.  Thank you so much for doing that.  I appreciate it.  Eagle Hearts season two.  I listened to you guys when you started on WNEW.  Oh, God.  I remember, like, so, because I grew up on WNEW. 
[02:57:00]  And then they changed their format.  And you guys came in.  And then you were complaining about the, I think you called it, like, ass-butt old music  that you had to play.  Butt rock.  Yeah, butt rock.  It was the evolution of rock and roll that they wanted us to do, even though we knew we  were bringing the station to the next level.  It was so weird.  Because you were, like, so funny and talking, doing all your shit.  And then suddenly you, and now here's Steely Dan.  Yeah.  It makes sense.  Yeah, that was really weird to have to do.  It was a strange combination.  I don't know how we made it because they all hated us there. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, you had fans.  That's what made you guys.  But we didn't have fans at first.  Well, we had to find them.  You had fans.  We had the people that were like, yeah, shut up and play the music.  No one's been doing shit.  When you're doing something and you think, you know, you're feeling good, you think you're  rolling on something.  And then you're finished.  You go into your dumb Steely Dan and then the phones are ringing.  You're like, oh, cool.  They're going to come in.  Why don't you shut up and play the music?  You know, you could have played two Steely Dan songs there if you didn't shut the fuck up.  Bring back fucking insert DJ that used to play music name.  I mean, Scott Muni was the only one. 
[02:58:00]  Was he a nice guy?  Beyond cool.  He sat us down and like kind of gave us the lay of the land.  And he's like, I know where he is now.  In a grave.  Yeah, yeah.  In a grave is where he is.  Oh, that's.  Broadcasting from that little bed.  Yeah.  That big fucking box in there.  It was one of those weird moments because me and Ann went on for the first time and Muni  actually stood outside the studio and he was looking in and we're like, that's Scott fucking  Muni.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  And we did our first break and he kind of nodded to us through the window and walked 
[02:58:30]  down the hall.  And that was his way of saying, you know, that's like, yeah, I'm passing the torch to you guys.  I hope that's like.  Back then it certainly was.  And who else was there?  Was Pete Fornatelle still there?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  I don't know who you know.  So I'm not going to say shit.  I don't know any of these guys.  Kids.  I'm out of show, but I got one foot in the past, one in the future.  These guys were not nice to us.  They were not nice.  Really?  No.  Well, they were like mad that you guys were coming in and taking out.  Well, what they did back then was it was all about faxes.  Yeah.  During their shows, Opie and Anthony suck. 
[02:59:00]  You guys got to get rid of him.  And then they would hang him up in the studio.  Oh, yeah.  That's how bad it was.  Jesus.  The wallpaper when we came in.  Yeah.  How long were you there?  Three years, I think.  Four years.  How did you last three years there?  I don't know.  Just with that kind of shit going on.  I know.  That was.  No, it transferred.  Then those guys were all pushed out one by one.  But the last year, that's when you guys started getting even more like mad that you  were even there, though.  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, and that probably helped shit.  Maybe we should shut up.  We've always been mad.  Kids.  I love you with all my heart.  Yeah.  I'm off now to. 
[02:59:30]  Yes.  Whore eagle heart.  It's on.  Let me plug it again.  Yeah.  Season two.  Guys, thank you.  That's really nice.  Premieres tomorrow.  No, I mean, Thursday at midnight.  Cartoon Network is part of Adult Swim.  Chris Elliott.  Come back and see us, man.  Thanks, guys.  I'll come back anytime.  Right on.  Yes.  Hold on.  Hey, fatso.  Get in here with the camera.  Chris Elliott.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Hi there.  This is Troy, phone screener for the Opie and Anthony Show, here to help you with a helpful 
[03:00:00]  tip.  When calling into the radio show, it's a good idea that you turn your radio down.  O&A, what's your name?  Where are you calling from?  Yeah, make sure Opie knows you don't know shit from shit.  Turn your radio down.  What?  I can't hear you.  Am I on the air?  Hey, asshole.  Am I live right now?  Hey, turn your radio down.  Hey, you.  Turn your radio down.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Punch it out.  See?  Wasn't that easy.  It gets you on the air faster and it makes you a better caller.  Oh, and if you want to call the show, just look down at your radio. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, right there.  Take your eyes off the road and look down.  See the number?  Just call 866-WOW1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Thank you and have a nice day.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  All right.  Chris Elliott was cool, huh?  Yes.  Yeah, it was good. 
[03:01:00]  Sitting down yapping with him.  Shitting and chatting.  Smash your face.  Hey, I'm getting kind of killed for a tweet.  Uh-oh.  And it's something I think is worth discussing.  What was your tweet?  Where is it?  The people are talking about the Buffett rule today.  The Buffett rule?  Jimmy?  What's that?  Warren Buffett, obviously.  Oh, Warren Buffett.  He's the other.  Obviously saying how he should be paying more taxes, right?  Well, he pays like 15%, I think. 
[03:01:30]  My whole thought on this, and people are trying to politicize my stupid tweet, I wrote, Buffett  rule.  Tell the world you don't pay your fair share of taxes long past when it doesn't matter to  you anymore.  That's all I was saying.  Right.  Because he's old.  And then people are beating the shit out of me.  I'm like, look, it's easy for him to say that now.  I don't think it's too brave to say what he's saying.  And everyone's praising Warren Buffett.  The fact is, he took advantage of the tax laws for many, many years. 
[03:02:00]  It doesn't matter to a guy like that.  So now it's easy to say that.  Yeah.  How about the people that are trying to build up an empire like he has now from the beginning?  It gets in the way.  That's all I'm trying to say.  People are like, what?  You don't think billionaires and millionaires should pay as much taxes as the common man?  I'm like, that's not what I'm saying.  All I'm saying is Warren Buffett took advantage of the system for his entire life.  And now he's at the end of his life and he comes out with this shit.  He should have said this years ago.  This is how he believes. 
[03:02:30]  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah.  Say it when you're trying to build up your whole thing, that you have your empire.  And every single person that has listened to our voices wants to keep more money.  Yeah.  That's where we're all in agreement.  It's easy to say, you know, oh, a millionaire is a billionaire should be paying more taxes.  Guess what?  If you were one of those guys, you'd want to keep as much money as humanly possible.  You don't think every one of these people that say, you know, yeah, the 99 percent, these rich, like Michael Moore and stuff. 
[03:03:00]  You think Michael Moore goes to his accountant?  Right.  Before tax time.  Right.  And says, nah, you know what?  No deductions.  Nothing.  I don't want to take any of these deductions.  I just pay as much tax as I possibly can.  Elvis did that, I think.  Elvis.  Just give them what they want.  Just give them what they want.  Really?  I don't care as long as I got my pills and my sandwiches.  I think that makes a good point.  Just about every person would try to figure out how they could pay a little less. 
[03:03:30]  Period.  It doesn't matter if you're making, I don't know, $100,000 or a fucking mil.  Where was Buffett 15 years ago when he was 60, whatever it is.  That's what I'm saying.  Because they're all praising Buffett for coming out with this and they're calling it the Buffett rule.  It's like, what a pussy.  Should have said this fucking 20 years ago.  But again, how does Jimmy Buffett feel about this?  He says that everybody should drink in Margaritaville.  Cheeseburgers in paradise.  He said, more than my fair share, as long as I have more fair shares of margaritas in Margaritaville. 
[03:04:00]  And it might be a good thing, this Buffett rule.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm not even going to say.  But, you know, my point being simple.  It's not as brave as you think.  Buffett rule is you got to wear a floppy hat, flip flops, just hang out on the beach, listen to some tunes.  No worries in the world.  No worries.  There you go.  Can we have a Buffett party to end our show?  Buffett party.  Buffett party.  I'm calling it.  Where are the Parrotheads? 
[03:04:30]  Where are all the Parrotheads?  What a business genius, this guy.  Yes, he really is.  He knows how to make millions.  He has a lot of money, doesn't he?  He doesn't Buffett, like, consistently.  The most successful restaurant, he's the most successful bar in the country.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  For a second.  He has a channel here, too.  Yeah.  Of course he does.  There's his picture up in the lobby.  I was mistaken about the Buffett rule, ladies and gentlemen.  I apologize.  Pepe Sinclair has sent me straight on Twitter.  Pepe Sinclair. 
[03:05:00]  Buffett rule.  Get there before E-Rock radio.  Oh.  I think that's, yeah, that's different.  See, I fucked up.  That's right.  I thought it was a tax thing.  Because you eat so much that your fat pig heart's going to stop or something.  Jeez, Chip.  Sorry.  And some people say Buffett owes over a billion dollars in back taxes on top of it.  All right.  He's fighting over back taxes.  Oh, he's fighting over back taxes.  So he's fighting the good fight.  Government's saying you owe a hell of a lot more, and he's in court fighting that shit. 
[03:05:30]  So then what the fuck is he talking about?  Thank you.  Yeah, whatever.  You can politicize all you want, but just go for a little line on the Twitter.  Relax.  I don't think Warren Buffett's a good guy.  Who thinks Warren Buffett's a good guy?  Play one of his big, big hits.  Oh, this is it.  This is like his big hit?  Cheeseburger and Parade.  I think Margaritaville.  I think Margaritaville is a big hit.  You have some margaritas or something and get into a drunk driving accident.  Stupid in there. 
[03:06:00]  Wow.  Cocksucking motherfucker.  Shut the fuck up.  You shut the fuck up when you ease the baskets.  Ah, there you go.  Yeah, you're a piece of asshole.  Hope you want to take shits in your basket.  Put them in your mouth.  Chip.  That's a little rude.  Spongecake.  Spongecake.  Who likes spongecake?  Watching the sun.  I only like it if I spill other cake.  To wash my cake dishes.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I like it as only to have a cake living at my house. 
[03:06:30]  It's not paying anything.  See, this is so annoying.  What is spongecake?  Spongecake.  It's Bob Squarepants' brother.  Tell me spongecake.  Squarecake.  Is that like that rum shit where it's really heavy?  No, it's light and airy.  They make it for a strawberry shortcake.  Of course you would know.  But it's very vanilla-y tasting.  I like spongecake.  Do you?  What does it look like?  I love spongecake with some vanilla icing. 
[03:07:00]  That's not spongecake.  Let me see.  That's not spongecake.  What is spongecake?  Let me see the spongecake smack in the face.  That's not spongecake.  What's spongecake?  Yeah.  That's not spongecake.  Do you guys like flan?  No, flan.  Flan sucks dick.  I ask because there's a picture of it on the images right now.  Flan is tremendously awful.  So overrated.  It's like rotted bread.  Fucking stinks.  What about key lime pie?  I love key lime pie.  I love the key lime pie.  But flan is shit. 
[03:07:30]  Especially when Paul's mom makes it sick.  I didn't forget.  I knew that was happening.  I didn't forget.  I knew that shit would go on down.  You like flan rolling?  It's egg custard.  Huh?  Egg custard.  Egg custard.  Egg custard.  That sounds disgusting.  Exactly.  It stinks.  It smells horrible.  It makes a awful key lime pie.  That's good.  Steve key lime pie is the best.  When I hear flan, I think phlegm.  Phlegm flan.  You're right.  Phlegm flan.  Phlegm flan.  Fucking flan is like a piece of cake with pus on it.  It's like my cake's had an injury. 
[03:08:00]  All right.  Just wait.  It's infected.  My cake's infected.  Flan is like lung butter.  Yeah, it is.  It's shit you just fucking cough up when you have the flu.  It's a cake with cancer.  Flan blows.  Flan stinks.  Your whole herd is stinks.  What's that?  Apple crumb pie I love.  What?  Yeah.  So does everybody in America.  What does he like?  Apple crumb pie.  Fucking shiny.  Apple crumb pie.  Oh.  He says apple weird, I think.  Say it again?  Apple.  All right.  Now you're saying it good.  That's flan.  Fucking blows flan on.  Get it off my table. 
[03:08:30]  I think I've had it, but I don't like it.  The consistency is like fucking, yeah.  It's a little gooky.  It's awful.  I don't like it at all.  I got some from my housekeeper.  I took one bite and the fucking, the rest went into the toilet.  Like I took a big flan shit and then I put back the fucking empty container like yum.  She does.  Have you had that yogurt that's the whips they're called?  Yeah, I don't like the whips.  It's like very fluffy.  I don't need my yogurt to be fluffy.  You know what?  You don't need it to be fluffy.  And I don't either.  But every so often?  Yeah.  Oh, that's so good.  I go with whipped cream at that point.  Oh, it's so good. 
[03:09:00]  At that point, just eat some whipped cream.  I know, but I would do that too.  Jimmy brings up a good point though.  We kind of share the same cleaning lady.  And she'll bring over her food from her people from time to time.  And we do the same thing.  We throw it in the garbage.  From our people.  We throw half of it in the garbage and leave the rest in the refrigerator knowing that  she's going to be in there anyway.  She always asks because I don't have shit stains in my underwear shoes.  How come we don't have the marks Mr. Greger has?  I don't know why she's Asian all of a sudden.  She's not Asian. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, Mr. Eddie's father.  Where was that from?  The courtship of Eddie's father.  Mr. Eddie's father.  That was a pretty stereotypical Asian character.  I'm surprised they'd get in trouble.  With my own damn fault.  Do we do?  What are other big songs by Jay Buffett?  He's only got two.  What's another hit?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  He's rocking this one.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I remember this one, I think. 
[03:10:00]  It's called Thins.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think this is about the Caribbean.  Of course it is.  Right?  I think this is in a movie.  Yeah.  Called the Cincinnati Train Express.  Wait, so are those whips good?  Yeah, they're fucking creamy, fluffy.  They're so light and airy.  It's like a moose. 
[03:10:30]  A yogurt-y moose.  Wonderful.  Yes.  The Yoplait Whips.  I like the Pussy Whip.  See, because it tastes like pussy, but it's Pussy Whip would be like what, you know.  What?  Let's just go home, man.  Do you want to get my picture here?  We should.  Let's go home.  How am I going home?  All right.  Do you want to get my picture here?  Never.  I want to go home.  Never.  I want to go home.  Never.  Never.  Never.  I can't believe you can't do our show. 
[03:11:00]  Never.  Well, take it up with the tough guy, Jay Thomas.  Why is he a tough guy?  He's a tough guy.  Is he being a tough guy, really?  He is a tough guy.  There's a picture of him.  Never.  Ira.  Oh, it's going to be a beautiful day.  Bright blue skies.  Under bright blue skies.  I love the guy.  You missed the guy.  Yeah. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  Sam, I think we did it.  I think we did.  Shut up, Sam.  Sam, just shut up.  You still got six minutes.  You don't stay on until 11.  That's for shit sure.  I would if I could.  See you.  All right.  It's really the end now.  It's the end of the show.  It's fucking, you know, 10 to 11.  Are we going to comical cons this year?  I don't know.  From comical cons.  I hope so.  Yeah.  Would you go?  Yeah.  That's a hit.  I don't know.  What do you guys want to fuck?  Everyone wants to fuck me. 
[03:12:00]  Nobody wanted to fuck you.  Nobody's ever wanted to fuck you.  That's shit.  Ever.  I'll be at the DC Improv this weekend.  Oh, yes.  And the Cincinnati Funny Bowl on the weekend after.  And then I tape in Cleveland.  Holy shit.  Cleveland's right around the corner now?  Two weeks.  And we still don't know where we're going to be?  No.  That's smart.  I got an email yesterday.  I just didn't read it because I saw who it was from.  Who was it from?  You know.  One of them.  Which one?  I'm not even sure.  Waldy.  I fixed their names up.  Their names and faces.  I'm just like, I don't even know which one that is.  It's always an excuse. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, we didn't expect.  So we have to.  And then.  And then hopefully tomorrow you can promote it.  Because of.  We've had to.  That's never your fault, is it?  We can still say what day.  We say we're going to Cleveland six months ago.  And we still can't say where we're going.  And he's going to claim it's someone else's fault?  Shut up.  Well, it's a technicality because of the.  Look at Roland.  He loves this.  He loves it so much. 
[03:13:00]  Because it's like.  How about you take responsibility?  You obviously fuck something up if it's not done yet.  But what happened?  The.  The.  We didn't expect the to come back with some.  So now we got to go.  So we're working on.  And hopefully they match their.  For us.  And you'll be able to promote soon.  Soon, really?  We're two weeks out.  It's two weeks from this Friday.  And we.  And we're still not telling people where we're going. 
[03:13:30]  Cleveland, Ohio.  How is that their.  How is it not their fault?  That's a great question.  It's like.  Great.  It's like Google Earth.  Yet we've only zoomed it down into a certain area.  Right.  Right.  We haven't really.  So right now you can see the entire city view.  But we need to, you know, zoom in a little further.  We're about halfway through the zoom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got to go Googling.  Exactly.  And Gary.  Keep these assholes out of the boy's office.  Oh.  From the.  Nope.  Someone spilled fucking. 
[03:14:00]  Or left a cup of red shit all over the place.  Who?  I don't know.  Who was it?  Wait.  Who was in your office?  I have no idea.  People use their office on the weekends.  I wasn't here over the weekend.  So Gary, how about you take care of that too, please?  Do they really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  You knew that?  By the way, that's Troy Kwan.  I don't know if you could tell.  His nose is pretty much healed.  So I know he looks different.  That's Troy.  It's a good nose you got there now.  Don't get the Troy update on the 10 o'clock show.  We get the Troy update tomorrow. 
[03:14:30]  Why don't you do it right now?  You still have show left.  Get out of here.  I'm going to talk to him.  You know, after we take a day off, we've got to ease into this slowly.  No, that's not the way it works.  Generally, get back to work.  Yeah, man.  I don't know.  I don't know where I'm going to go when I'm all going to go.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around, After ONA Live is next.  Series X out. 
[03:15:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Here we go.  Here we go.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  God, yesterday was beautiful.  Call us up right now.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  It's time to play What Did You Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show?  You call me and tell me, what did you learn? 
[03:15:30]  I can only think of one way to start this game out.  And that's with intern Jeff Spicoli.  Intern Jeff Spicoli?  Yes.  I've given you a couple days off from this.  Yes.  But two days in a row, you learned nothing from the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes.  Because you didn't listen.  Ah, yes.  Well...  Because you weren't listening to the show.  Now, I've given you a couple shows off.  Then you had a nice three-day weekend to rest that ever-so-important brain of yours. 
[03:16:00]  You know, I know there's a lot of stress under it.  A lot of responsibilities go along with an Opie and Anthony Show internship.  And you have to bear a lot of them.  So, you know, you have a lot on your plate.  Yeah.  You finally had a day of rest.  Yeah.  After all that...  Do you want to turn for first?  No.  No.  Let's let Spicoli start.  Intern Jeff Spicoli.  Yes.  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony Show?  I learned... 
[03:16:30]  And let's not make it something from the last 40 minutes.  You've been here since six.  You know what I mean?  Well, I was going to say, I learned that Chris Elliott always plays somebody with a deformity.  You know?  Why is it?  Scary Movie 2, The Little Hand, The Boyle's in Something About Mary, right?  Okay.  Well, that's...  I mean, you learned that from his movies, not from today's show.  And that's not true, because he was a regular cameraman in Groundhog's Day.  Yeah, and he's been on Letterman doing a lot of different stuff.  I realized it on this show, though.  I learned it...  That you got information wrong. 
[03:17:00]  Okay.  That doesn't...  What did you learn on today's Opie and Anthony Show?  That old school PSAs were hilarious?  I don't know.  I mean, that's very general.  For instance, today...  That's all I heard.  I haven't heard...  Today, I learned on the Opie and Anthony Show that homosexuals kill kids.  Okay, there you go.  See, that's something specific.  But I didn't learn...  I didn't listen that much.  That was in the PSA segment.  All I heard was that they were doing a PSA segment.  You still aren't listening much to the show.  No, no.  You always ask me on the days where I can't listen.  I was well prepared. 
[03:17:30]  Those are the days that you're here.  Well, yeah, but I was well prepared last Wednesday, and of course...  What did you learn on last Wednesday's Opie and Anthony Show?  I don't even remember.  You don't remember that one.  Yeah, that I guess Andre the Giant shit on somebody.  That was last Wednesday?  Yeah, that was last Wednesday.  You wrote that down for yourself?  Oh, I sure did.  I took notes.  Okay.  I mean, yeah, I mean, that would have been a good, like...  You'd say something like,  Today I learned did homosexuals kill kids.  Something like that.  Or today, I learned that Opie can't make boiled eggs. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, see, I didn't hear that.  You didn't hear that part.  No, you missed a lot of the show.  Eric, what do you have him doing that he can't listen to the show?  He's listening to all worst of and cataloging it.  He's just, like, writing descriptions of who's in studio.  And that's so important that he cannot at all have one ear on the show.  I think he could do both, but...  You'd think?  I'm doing it at Jock Prep, the Jock Prep area, and I don't know.  We got headsets.  Well, you're right.  All right.  Somehow I've figured out every loophole, haven't I? 
[03:18:30]  Oh, jeez.  Well, thank you, Jeff Spicola.  You failed again.  Luke, what did you learn on today's Opie and Anthony show?  Actually, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Luke, you get the sweeper.  Here comes...  What did we learn?  What did we learn?  What did you learn, Luke?  Well, I learned that Chris Elliott is a funny motherfucker, and he makes a great guest on ONA. 
[03:19:00]  That he does.  Thank you.  Yes.  Chris Elliott, he was a legend.  He is a legend.  He was in here.  Eric, I'm assuming you're a big Chris Elliott guy, since we've talked about how you're...  When you were a kid, you were obsessed with Letterman.  Yeah.  His bits on Letterman, plus Get a Life.  I was a huge fan of Get a Life.  And now he's on Cartoon Network, and that's your shit.  That's my shit.  Yeah.  Um, James in North Carolina.  Sam, what I learned on today's Opie and Anthony show, that Bob is a fucking retard, and he 
[03:19:30]  needs to get fired as Opie and Anthony's agent.  Why?  I will be the agent, because Bob, Bob in California should have been all over this shit from Cleveland  a fucking month ago, and the boys need to go talk to Mel fucking Karmazin, and jump over  all those other assholes who don't know what the fuck they're doing.  And I learned the shit, and Sam like the fuck all the time. 
[03:20:00]  Jesus.  James needs his own show.  Wow, you do?  He's a blowhard, is what he is.  No, I didn't know that.  And I also don't think that Opie and Anthony would sick their agent on, you know, a live...  It's just a live gig.  We're just trying to get management in line and figure out when we can announce the venue.  Phillip, in Oklahoma, you're on after Opie and Anthony live.  Yeah, I learned today that a major company like Kodak should have a backup plan to move 
[03:20:30]  forward with technology.  Yeah.  It's kind of a dumb moment, you know?  You're right.  We learned today, yeah, Kodak, I guess, filing for bankruptcy at the same time that Instagram  is being sold for a billion dollars.  Also, whose screening call is in there?  That would be Paul.  Yeah.  Paul thought that you said Kodak should have a backup fan.  As in, I guess...  I guess the people at Kodak get warm while they're working.  I don't know.  Thank you, Phillip.  Snowy. 
[03:21:00]  Hey, Sam.  How you doing?  How are you doing, buddy?  Apparently, I found out you're never too old to get an Easter basket from Mommy and Daddy,  apparently.  That's right.  That's right.  You could be very quickly approaching 30 and still be getting Easter baskets.  Travis in Kentucky, what did you learn?  Sam, I learned your girlfriend is so fucking hot.  She doesn't need to wear a bathing suit and her pussy so wet she could eat a pool with it.  She could...  Paul, our phone screener, thought you were going to say she could eat a pool with her body. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Eat it.  Eat it.  Thank you.  Paul's an idiot.  Thank you, Travis.  No problem.  Sean in North Dakota.  I learned that Paltalk drama is all fun and games until the room gets closed.  Did the Paltalk room get closed today?  Yeah.  No mention of it.  So it was worth it.  I guess so.  Things you can learn from the show on all different angles.  I didn't even learn that from the show today.  Jay in Tampa, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show? 
[03:22:00]  Good evening.  Good evening.  I learned that Anthony's compound is the place to be during the race riots.  Yes.  And that Jess does not need a suit to swim in Anthony's pool.  Apparently.  Every time I've gone swimming with Jess, she's worn a bathing suit.  But Ant has this idea that at some point she'll get fed up with something I'm doing and call Anthony,  ask to go swimming at his house, and not bring a bathing suit.  That's what goes on in Anthony's head.  It was also fun to watch Anthony react to the Black Panthers saying that they wanted to start a race riot, 
[03:22:30]  I guess with white people here in America.  And while Anthony said, you know, I don't want a race riot to start, he was definitely ready.  He said if the race war is brought to him, the shit will go down.  Android virus.  Chris, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  I learned a couple things.  I learned that Chris Elliott's daughter was on SNL.  I didn't know that.  No, I didn't know that either until I was, you know, researching him. 
[03:23:00]  Thank God she looks like her mother, you know.  And I learned that Troy Krohn got a new nose.  I thought he was just getting some shit cleaned out of his nose.  I didn't think he was getting a complete whole nose job.  It was mainly a cosmetic surgery.  Yeah, I don't know.  It was pretty much all cosmetic.  And while they were doing that, they cleaned some stuff out of it.  Patrick, in Vermont, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  I learned that not everybody has had the meat sweats.  I thought everybody had had the meat sweats before. 
[03:23:30]  Not everybody, no.  Another tidbit that we got from the Chris Elliott interview.  Andrew.  Hey, uh, never wears pantyhose, lips underground, carry the pitchfork,  and Anthony's got the bad case of the itches to start a race war for us.  We learned both of those things thanks to the Black Panthers today.  Scott in Tallahassee.  I learned that Anthony's fake hair looks so good that it fooled Chris Elliott.  It was funny to hear Chris Elliott saying that it's like when people get fake hair 
[03:24:00]  and it looks fine on TV until you sit next to them.  And guess what?  That's the difference.  That's why Anthony has been spreading the gospel of he doesn't have hair plugs like some people say.  No.  That's the difference between individually placed follicles that are artistically implanted  in the direction that the hair grows.  You see the difference now, Scott?  That's right.  It's his own hair. 
[03:24:30]  That's right.  From the harvest area.  Thank you, Scott.  Buddy, what did you learn on today's Opie and Anthony show?  Yeah, too slow.  Tim in Oklahoma, what did you learn?  Happy birthday, Sam.  I learned that Bobo cooties is the only thing keeping Jess from getting naked at Anthony's house.  Maybe that's what it is.  I don't know what it is.  Eric, were you over at Ant's house the time that Bobo ended up nude in the pool?  No, I wasn't there.  Well, what happened was, and they got into this a little bit, but I guess Ant had a compound party. 
[03:25:00]  And I don't remember who.  It might have been Keith the cop.  I don't remember whose idea.  It was not cleared with Anthony.  But we were on the phone with Bobo.  I remember Danny was there.  I mean, Danny was definitely there because he's the one who did the snipping.  Um, but Danny and me and I think, yeah, Norton was definitely there and Ant and obviously and a couple other people.  But we, Bobo was calling us, I think, trying to get to the party.  And so Keith told him, if you get on this train, I will pick you up at the train station, Keith the cop, and I will drive you to Ant's house. 
[03:25:30]  So Keith the cop picked up Bobo.  And when he picked him up at the train station, he told Bobo, look, sorry, buddy.  We're going to need to put a bag over your head.  That way you won't know Ant's address.  Bobo agreed.  So Bobo, with the bag over his head, showed up at Anthony's compound, jumped in, and we said, you know, let's all jump in the pool. 
[03:26:00]  He didn't have a bathing suit, so he jumped in the pool in his tighty-whities.  And Danny, being the genius that he is, ran into the kitchen for some scissors and snipped those little tighty-whities right off young Bobo.  And he galloped around like an enchanted pixie, completely nude for the rest of the evening, all around the pool and the bay area.  Was he asking to come to this party, or was he demanding, like he usually does, that he needs to be at this party?  He's probably demanding. 
[03:26:30]  Kevin, in South Carolina, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, Sam, love you, love the show.  Thanks.  I learned now it's okay to say fucking nigger on TV.  All right, Kevin, I'm starting to think that you just made that call so you could say.  No, you called me.  Damn you.  Yeah.  I thought so.  Damn you.  All right.  Dave in St. Louis, what did you learn?  Well, I learned that my dick gets hard when rolling giggles.  Dave, you did learn that. 
[03:27:00]  Thank you, Dave.  I'm just hanging up on you.  That's the power that I have.  You could giggle for as long as you want, but I have a button that makes the giggling stop.  Yeah, Roland, he was having a hell of a giggle for himself when Anthony, at the end of the show,  was discussing Boss's emails that he ignored.  And on that note, we are indeed taking the show to Cleveland.  We haven't technically announced the venue yet.  And to my knowledge, I'm not allowed to tell you exactly where it will take place. 
[03:27:30]  But just make the plans now to be in the Cleveland area.  There's not that many venues, so you could probably guess around where we're going to be at.  Make your plans now to be in the Cleveland area.  That's Friday, April 27th.  Correct, young Nagel?  Sure.  Why not?  You think so?  Check your calendar.  Yeah, hang on.  I mean, listen, I can't be giving the people misinformation here.  This is going to be a giant show.  We've got a whole bunch of stuff planned that we're going to do. 
[03:28:00]  Yes, the 27th.  So it's Friday, April 27th.  It's going to be an afternoon show.  So if you're going to take a half day off work, take the second half off.  If you take the morning off, you're going to still have to go to work, and you're still going to miss the show.  But, you know, you've just lost half a day for nothing.  You get to sleep in a little bit, but that won't be as fun as this Cleveland show will be.  So make your plans now to either not be at work or to come in from out of town or whatever you're going to do because we – I've heard the Cleveland rocks, and I would like to find out for sure whether or not that's the case. 
[03:28:30]  E-Rock.  Do you think we'll do the Cleveland tourism videos again?  What's that?  Remember, we used to watch the videos where the guy would just sing about all the cool things to do in Cleveland, and at least it's not Detroit.  Oh, I kind of remember that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you want me to play one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's put – we've done it on the show before, right?  When did we do this?  A few times.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know.  I don't have a date, but we've done it since we were on Terrestrial. 
[03:29:00]  Right.  I remember you bringing this up.  Okay, yeah.  These are the Cleveland tourism.  I get – but this is like a viral video or a real video?  Yeah, it's actually – well, it was a viral video.  It was a goof.  Yeah, but it got so popular they made a second one as well.  Right, okay.  And then that one got really popular, and I don't know what they did after that.  All right, here it is.  Fun times in Cleveland today.  Cleveland.  Come on down to Cleveland town, everyone.  Come and look at both of our buildings. 
[03:29:30]  Buy some food that's prepared near the street.  Who knows, you might even see this sky.  You should come on down to West 6th Street.  It's the perfect place if you're a douchebag.  Watch the poor people all wait for buses.  Who the fuck still uses a paid phone?  Here's the place where they're used to the industry.  This train is carrying jobs out of Cleveland.  Cleveland leads the nation in drifters.  Here's a statue of Moses Cleveland.  He's the guy who invented Cleveland. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah!  You know, that song is very fitting, because Danny brought up a great question the other day.  I can't remember.  I must have.  It was off the air, obviously.  It must have been during one of the commercial breaks, because Opie and Anthony don't exactly hang out when the show is over.  So it must have been during one of the commercial breaks or something.  Oh!  You know what it was?  We were out all together as a group filming something, which I don't even think.  I don't know if we're supposed to talk about it or not.  I don't think so.  Yeah, we were all filming something together, which was, by the way, I should talk about that. 
[03:30:30]  It was the first time.  We don't hang out.  Like, the staff.  Like, every...  I hang out with E-Rock on a social level probably three times a year.  Is that fair, Eric?  Uh, yeah, it's usually to events or something.  And that's, like, a big deal.  Like, not to say that, you know, we dress to the nines, but that's, like, that's a lot for the staff around here.  Like, outside of here, I'd probably hang out with Troy probably about the same, three times a year. 
[03:31:00]  I would hang out with Roland, but he flakes out.  He's the worst at hanging out.  Seven trains not working.  Exactly.  He just makes shit up.  And then you're like, oh, the real reason...  Because he's on a diet.  So I go, oh, the real reason you didn't hang out is because you didn't want to drink, right?  And he goes, exactly.  That's the reason.  And, you know, that's a lie, too.  He just flakes out of everything.  Who knows why he doesn't do the things he does?  But...  So we as a staff, like, we don't hang out at all anymore.  There was a time when we did it a little more. 
[03:31:30]  But, you know, we just don't.  We used to go to lunches.  Yeah, I guess we did.  And it's not like...  We don't, like, hang out with Opie and Anthony anymore, either.  It's like...  They used to take us to lunches?  Well, used to in the sense that, like, they did, like, twice in the first couple years of XM.  Anthony took us to lunches?  Oh, that's right.  He used to every...  But, I mean, those were sporadic.  But, I mean, nothing has happened since, what, the K-Rock days?  I'll say 2008. 
[03:32:00]  I think that was around the last time.  Okay, I'm going to put this phone up.  Kevin in Connecticut?  Hi.  Oh, okay.  I was trying to read what Paul meant by the, uh...  What were you going to say about the...  Please tell me what the screener said that I said.  No, I think I read...  Guy who does the Cleveland song has another song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What did he say it was called?  Uh, I'm a stupid cat.  Okay, you got it right.  Fantastic!  Way to go, Paul! 
[03:32:30]  You are improving.  I'll tell you this.  Paul is better in there than Jeff Spicoli.  Intern Jeff Spicoli is terrible because his speed is so bad.  He doesn't understand that the what-did-you-learn game, you got to be rapid-fire because you  got to plunk down those calls.  Paul is much better in terms of speed.  Obviously, we've learned today not good in terms of spelling.  But, Kevin, you know, you gave him two points for that.  It's only a minute long.  It's good for you.  It's pretty good.  Called I'm a Stupid Cat?  I'm a Stupid Cat.  All right.  Maybe we'll look it up a little later on in the show. 
[03:33:00]  Thank you, Kevin.  Bye-bye.  Um, I didn't know what he was saying at first.  Now, uh, no, but we...  Even, even like the staff, we used to hang out in the office together when the show was  young.  Um, and by young, I mean this incarnation of it.  You know, in the XM days.  Like, we used to hang out on Fit.  Didn't we used to hang out on 57th Street sometimes?  Uh, sometimes, yeah.  And we'd go out and...  Every now and then.  It just doesn't happen at all.  So, this is what I'm getting at.  Um, we... 
[03:33:30]  A group of us...  It wasn't the whole staff, but it was Ant, E-Rock, me, and Danny all went out to film  something for a guy that we know.  And it was the first...  I was thinking, like, this was the first time we had hung out.  And I realized why none of us hang out together.  I mean, there was not one word said amongst any...  It was just awkward.  The whole thing.  None of us said anything to each other.  We didn't talk.  We didn't have any shared interest.  We didn't have any shared experiences to discuss. 
[03:34:00]  We didn't bring business outside of it.  None of us talked at all.  Did you find that, Eric?  I was looking at my phone.  The whole time, right?  Oh, yeah.  All of us were, except for when that school let out, and everyone was just commenting  on the kids that were being disrespectful walking past.  They weren't even...  We weren't even commenting to each other.  No.  Like, we were just commenting.  Like, we were just having outbursts.  Like, there was no...  Why is that?  I don't know.  It's just been so long.  I don't think we know how to interact with each other anymore.  We've just all grown apart. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  Do you like everybody here?  I have no problems with anybody anymore.  That's all of us, I think.  All of us have...  I think any kind of shit that we might have had in the past is long gone.  But listen to what you said.  Yeah.  I think that's the way we all feel about each other.  All of us, we have no problems with each other.  None of us like each other, but none of us specifically dislike each other.  We don't have any...  I think it's just a feeling of indifference.  Yeah.  We don't have any specific problems, but they're not people who we would choose to spend our 
[03:35:00]  social lives with.  They're not...  We wouldn't put them in...  We would keep them in our work Google Plus circle.  Not the friendship part.  Correct.  It's just a weird thing.  Just the way it works out.  But the Cleveland song is...  Because Danny goes like, what are we going to do in Cleveland?  Like, we're doing an afternoon show.  So you'd think the broadcast will probably end around 7 o'clock.  Yeah.  So from 7 p.m. on, the group of us is in Cleveland.  Like, what are we going to do? 
[03:35:30]  Do what...  Have you...  I don't know.  Are you going to hang out?  I guess so, yeah.  After the show?  Why not?  You know, what else is there to do?  I think we should.  I don't think we should separate.  I think we should all hang out.  The last time I was in Cleveland with the show, we went to some sushi restaurant.  And by the way, that was not when the whole show was there.  That was a couple of you guys, right?  It was like Opie, Anthony, and Jim, and then maybe you and maybe one other person.  Kenny was there.  Right.  Because it wasn't like...  Steve was there.  The staff, though, wasn't. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, I don't think the staff as a whole was there.  Because Danny wasn't and I wasn't.  And, you know...  We went to a sushi restaurant in Cleveland and it was on XM's dime.  So Opie decided to order, like, I think it was like $900 worth of sushi.  Jesus.  And after we were done eating, all the extras we took had it wrapped up.  And Opie decided to go out in front of the sushi restaurant and set it up there and resell it to the homeless.  That's kind of fine.  Right in front of the sushi restaurant.  So he had these little tables and the garbage cans and he just opened up all the containers 
[03:36:30]  and was selling the sushi back to the homeless.  But then what happened after that?  After that, pretty much...  Did you hang out?  No, I think everyone...  Thank you, Roland.  Almost everybody went back to the hotel room.  No.  I remember there was some kind of club down the street that Steve wanted to go to.  And we went down there.  I wonder what kind of club that was.  It's not what I thought it was going to be.  A lot of men in shiny leather.  And so I was there for a little while and then I was just like, Steve, I'm heading back. 
[03:37:00]  Because how long are you going to hang out in a gay club for?  I was there.  I was there maybe 15 minutes.  Did you get hit on by any guys?  No.  Not even Steve?  No.  Steve didn't try anything with you.  This was still in Steve's drinking days where he was just focused right on the bar.  Because this sounds a little bit like the PSAs we were watching today where Steve picked  you up in his car and he goes, here, young Eric, I've played basketball with you.  Now I'd like to show you where I hang out.  Enjoy a lemon shot.  And he took you to this leather and lace club. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  No, it was some weird, I guess it was supposed to be a rock club, but at night it turned  into like a rave dance thing.  Oh my God.  So that's when I was like, all right, I'm done.  And I went back to the hotel.  Look who got the hotline number.  Sam, you are a dick.  Why?  Oh my God.  What a nasty person.  We don't hang out or like hanging out or there's a difference.  That's not the case.  First of all, when we were doing that shoot, people were working. 
[03:38:00]  We couldn't hang out and talk because, you know, we were giving orders.  E-Rock, E-Rock, me and Danny were literally just kind of like staring at each other.  Yeah.  You're standing on line.  It was boring, you know?  I guess.  There wasn't much to do.  And then as far as Cleveland goes, listen, you non-drinking faggot motherfucker, we're  going to find plenty of shit to do.  It's called a bar.  And then once you get a few in you, we all start yapping at each other.  I hope he said he had a good time at the bachelor party and didn't think he was going to 
[03:38:30]  even though I was not drinking.  Hey.  I have a good time even though I don't drink.  And we have to run out of there.  So management doesn't catch up.  So we don't have to hang out to lunches anymore.  And that's true.  And this stupid office is so miniature that none of us can hang out in there.  We used to hang out and sit in the office and like go through the paper, look at this,  and actually maybe do a little brainstorming before the show.  But now we can't even sit in the same office as our staff. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  Why shouldn't we be able to sit with the staff for the show where maybe someone will say  something and it'll be like, oh, I'll grab that sound or I'll do that.  But no, we were in two separate places the whole fucking day.  They ruined it for us because we had a big office at XM and we all hung out before the  show and we had a big office at K-Rock and we all hung out before the show.  Right.  We used to hang out and now, no, we can't.  We're in different areas, different quadrants. 
[03:39:30]  And then they parade those fucking bosses over to us that we just got to run down the  hall before we see them.  Yeah, because...  My Uncle Fester fucking caught us today, though.  He got you, huh?  Oh, yeah.  He's walking.  It's like the show's just ending.  And it doesn't even look like he was there.  It looks like he's trying to catch us on purpose, but he's trying to look like, oh, I was just  casually walking in front of your studio the second you're done with the show. 
[03:40:00]  When you know he was listening in the side studio.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Then he comes out.  I do like the strategy, though.  I think there's a strategy that you and Opie tend to start insulting management right before  the show ends, because you're thinking, right, why would they come and approach you after  you've just said nasty things about them?  Yeah.  Well, he came by and opened the door to the studio.  I literally walked out under his arm as he was holding the door to get the fuck out of  there.  And they've ruined that for us, too, then. 
[03:40:30]  I'm sure we would all be going to lunches and whatnot, except...  We absolutely would.  That was my actual point.  Yeah.  It's like, you're saying that we don't get along at all or anything.  It's like, no, they put us in this horrible situation, like a POWs.  They separate us.  They don't want us talking to each other lest we might escape.  That's right, because they want the communication to go through them, from us to them to you.  Right.  None of this...  Let me take this opportunity, Sam. 
[03:41:00]  I'm having a giant Memorial Day bash at the compound, and you are cordially invited,  as is everybody else on staff.  Yay!  Even...  Wait, wait, wait.  Even Eric?  Even Eric.  Yay!  And you watch us have a good time.  If you don't have a good time, you can fucking leave.  I always do have a good time at the compound parties.  And I will make sure Jess has a place to stay and has a safe drive home at some point.  Now, what if Jess doesn't feel like bringing a bathing suit? 
[03:41:30]  What if she could all...  I see bathing suit...  I see bathing suit.  She knows.  She knows she's been naked.  She knows at this point.  When is it?  When is the Memorial Day party?  I would guess Memorial Day weekend.  On Saturday?  There is a pre-Memorial Day party to shake things down, but that's going to be announced  the Wednesday before the weekend, because I'm going to wait until I know it's a really  good weekend.  Oh, I understand.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to kind of work things out like that. 
[03:42:00]  But, yeah, huge party.  And you watch.  All of us are going to be cohorting, drinking, and yelling out a racial episode.  You hear Rowan's excited about it?  Exactly.  All right, you have fun.  I'm going to listen to the rest of the Master Show.  Yay!  All right, goodbye.  All right, take it easy, Schittell. 
[03:42:30]  You think management is specifically...  Today's the meeting.  Huh?  Today's our meeting.  Look, I wish you guys wouldn't talk about...  We want you guys to have fun with each other.  We want you to hang out.  I don't do impressions of management.  Well, that's not anyone specific.  That's a general...  You just do impressions of management.  That's a general...  First of all, you were sitting there giggling while Opie was saying horrible things about  Gary.  No, I was watching on my iPad a funny bit from George Carlin.  Which bit?  I don't...  You asshole. 
[03:43:00]  You couldn't think of one Carlin bit.  I just got Bruce on my mind.  You went to the Bruce show last night?  Yeah, it was awesome.  Yeah.  And another person approached me.  Hey, tell Sam I love the shit show.  I'm like...  Really?  Yeah.  I guess this after show is very popular.  And also, I got a bunch of people.  I love ONA.  ONA has a lot of Bruce fans out there.  That's the blue-collar American.  Yeah.  Are you going to go to Anthony's Memorial Day party?  You went to one.  This year, I'm going to go in honor of Troy and get lit. 
[03:43:30]  You are going to get lit.  Yeah.  Last night, you didn't drink that much.  No, because by then, it'll be the end of my 90 days.  Oh.  And I'm going to just fucking go balls out.  So you're going 90 days without drinking.  90 days without drinking.  Then my racial epitaph will just jump up tenfold.  Well, you actually have not had any problem.  You have still been making racial epitaphs while not drinking.  I've noticed that.  Yeah, but they're not as fun.  Not as fun.  No.  And there's consequences.  Yeah.  When you're drinking before them, no consequences.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the alcohol.  I'm sorry.  Have you gotten the shakes? 
[03:44:00]  Have you gone through withdrawal syndromes?  No, I'm not that bad.  No.  Yeah, he shakes his head.  Yes, I have.  Yeah.  When did you start?  A week ago.  And what's the diet exactly?  It's like you do like two protein shakes and you take these vitamins and then one balanced  meal.  And you started one week ago?  Yeah, on April Fool's.  Okay.  So about a week and a half ago.  Yeah, a week and a half ago.  So you've got to go April, May, June.  Well, then I make Memorial Day. 
[03:44:30]  So Memorial Day is becoming the exception.  Yeah, Memorial Day.  It's like Fourth of July.  You cannot go on a diet for Fourth of July.  Eric, are you going to get all fucked up at the Memorial Day bash?  It's hard because I've got to drive.  You're going to get all fucked up in Cleveland?  Cleveland, I don't have to drive anywhere.  I probably could do that.  Or you sleep in your truck afterwards and just pass out.  Well, Anthony, I'm sure, would let you stay in one of the palatial live from the  compound rooms.  I cannot impose.  That wouldn't be an imposition at all.  If he got to see you all fucked up, I'll bet he would let you. 
[03:45:00]  Well, it's not posing when you fucking pass out and blackout.  Yeah.  It's some necessity.  If you pass out in the basement, it's not an imposition at all, is it, Roland?  Hell no.  It's like, what the fuck happened?  I hope he has pancakes tomorrow.  There's a difference.  It's not making breakfast.  Oh, I don't know.  There's a difference between imposing and what the fuck happened, right?  Yeah.  There's a couch down there.  Shit happens at a party.  Um, you haven't had any, I haven't seen you had one alcoholic beverage at a show event  since the infamous paycheck incident. 
[03:45:30]  Nope.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no, no.  That was in 2005.  And that was the last time, right?  Yeah, that was the last time.  Roland, do you remember the paycheck incident?  I do.  Paul's in there, right?  He just walked back in.  Ask him if he remembers the paycheck incident.  Do you remember the paycheck incident?  Yes.  I think he's lying.  He's lying.  Do you, Paul?  I'm talking to you.  Wait, no, I'm thinking of an incident on the Ron and Fez show, so I might be wrong about  it.  He didn't remember the entire... 
[03:46:00]  Eric.  That's why I saw a dead stare in his eyes.  I'm like, I think he's lying.  It's just a macchiere and pie.  It looks nice, but it's disappointing unless you taste it.  Level with me.  The entire time, Paul was not familiar with the paycheck incident, correct?  I don't believe so, no.  What's that when someone took a dump on your paycheck?  What?  What?  No, wrong...  No.  Huh?  Wrong staffer and an older bit.  Okay.  No.  Anyway, Paul's gonna...  I would think that Paul would enjoy that one because he's got his little rivalry with  you because you keep taking credit for his stuff and he keeps not being able to get his 
[03:46:30]  points across on the air.  You don't mind if I inform the listeners, do you, Eric?  No, we talked about it last week.  Did we talk about it last week?  Yeah, that's how it came up.  When?  Wait, are you talking about the thing with Paul?  No, no, no.  The paycheck.  Oh, the paycheck.  No, no.  Okay, I was about to say, Jesus, have I been in a coma?  Yeah, what happened was this was the last time Eric drank at a show event.  Opi brought... 
[03:47:00]  Well, tell them what I was drinking.  What were you drinking?  I don't remember.  Um, cause at the bar, it was the, um, the, uh, Ron and Fez welcoming party to XM and we  were at BB King's in Times Square and they had an open bar, but there was just a certain,  you know, kind of drinks that you can have for the open bar.  And I was sitting there and I was drinking red wine and hold on.  Hold on.  At one point I got, this is kind of warm.  Could you put some ice cubes in it?  So I'm drinking red wine with ice cubes, not realizing, cause where I was sitting in 
[03:47:30]  the bar, I had to turn to where my back was to see the stage where Ron and Fez and Norton  were and everything.  So the, the guy kept refilling my glass and I'd come back and drink and I never questioned  that my glass kept getting refilled.  And you're just sitting there drinking wine with ice, like a piece of Florida white trash.  Long Island, but yes.  Yeah, I feel like Carrie Bradshaw.  Did Carrie Bradshaw drink wine with ice?  No. 
[03:48:00]  So red wine with ice.  Though E-Rock was getting drunk off red wine all night because he doesn't realize that  it was kept, it kept being refilled and I kept drinking it and never realized that it  was being refilled.  Right.  Yeah.  So Obi brought his, uh, then I guess, girlfriend, fiance, now wife, now wife, this is the woman  that he chose to spend his life with.  Yes.  He brought her with him to this event and she has a very good sense of humor.  So one of the other staffers, who was it?  I don't remember.  I said it to Travis.  Travis.  Okay. 
[03:48:30]  So I guess, I guess Travis is joking around with her, right?  And he stays, you know, making some, whatever, sarcastic little jokes.  It wasn't so much that it was the, uh, you know, like a lot of our events, some of the  fans get a little out of control, get a little too, uh, forceful or like, Hey, I'm a big fan  or why aren't you talking to me, you know, becoming a problem.  But what he did was he pulled Travis aside, did Eric Nagel.  Yeah.  And he said, Hey, Travis, you gotta be careful with that. 
[03:49:00]  And Travis goes, what?  What do you, what do you mean with that?  He said, you have to watch out for, we have to watch out for that.  Yeah.  And he's pointing at Opie's now wife, then whatever, girlfriend.  And Travis is like, why?  And Eric goes, because that right there, that's the paycheck.  I will say, like, I, I remember say, saying those words, but in my head, it seemed a lot  more logical than what was coming out. 
[03:49:30]  And probably slick too.  Like, Oh, this is, I'm imparting some wisdom down on young Travis right now, calling Opie's  wife the paycheck.  You never, you, I'm glad you can laugh about this now.  Oh, I think it's funny.  Because you were not laughing about this for like, no, not early on because early on, like  three or four years after you were still not laughing about it.  Like now we're about six years after it and we can all recollect fondly.  That's fine.  But back then, how embarrassed were you the next day? 
[03:50:00]  I didn't know the next day.  It didn't, I didn't know until when we, it was probably like three days until we came  back.  Cause I think we did it on a Friday if I remember right.  And that was the night I disappeared too.  Cause master Poe, um, our own security guard didn't like the fact that I was in  intoxicated and he wanted to make sure I got home.  Okay.  At a bar, at a show event at a bar.  I called master Poe screen for help when I was drunk and he was driving around trying  to find me for two hours. 
[03:50:30]  He goes, where are you?  I go, help, help.  That's right.  We used to go out and get rolling drunk.  And then we call master Poe and tell him that Roland is running, running around 57th street  with his pants down and needs help.  I don't see you.  I go, I see you.  Help me.  He goes, hi, I'm coming.  And he took everything so overly serious that he fell for it every time.  What a dick.  So Eric, you didn't, so you disappeared. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  Well, this I remember too, cause he, he yelled at me Monday morning.  He grabbed me by my shirt.  Like you would yank somebody over here and he was like pointing his finger in my face  to give me a lecture.  Oh, because he, cause he saw how bad I was and he wanted to make sure that I got home.  Okay.  How often do you drink to that extent?  Very rarely.  Seldom.  Seldom at all.  And he, he was yelling at me, he said, you know, um, at the event that, you know, I'm going  to make sure you get home.  And I didn't like him.  He was driving me nuts.  So I, I snuck past him and somehow stumbled onto the subway. 
[03:51:30]  And the next thing I know, I woke up, I was back in my apartment.  You did end up back in your apartment.  Yeah.  Isn't it weird how you can not remember, but you still, you're, you, you.  I remember going to the subway and then the next thing I know, I remember it was like five  something in the morning and I'm laying in my bed.  So when it was first brought up on the air the next Monday, this is how you would refer  to the love of Opie's life.  I was not.  And plus this was early on.  So you're probably still trying to get in good with the boss. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  This was a, this was about a year into the XM gig.  So you're, so you're still trying to get Opie and Anthony and Jim to like you.  Like you, now you don't even like you.  It's just don't hate me.  Respect you too.  Well, look, I mean, that's gone now, but back then I think you were still trying for  it.  You were still trying.  How, when did you give up having them respect you?  Uh, when did I give up?  I gave up on last week.  I gave up on Opie after he ditched me at the Meadowlands for the Rolling Stone concert. 
[03:52:30]  And that was, that was a month after the, um, the, uh, the paycheck.  The paycheck.  Okay.  So before the, because I figured, I think that there was some element of you that was  still fighting for their respect and that it didn't truly die until E-Rocktober.  Once E-Rocktober hit and you had that, and it was only a week of it, but you had those  days of bashing. 
[03:53:00]  That's when you were done.  You know, I look back at that, that, that stuff too.  And I, I, I kind of measured it out and I really thought about it and I don't know what  I was getting so upset over.  I don't know what was going through my head at that point in my life, but everything was  really like hitting too hard.  And it really, it wasn't.  Cause you actually had to pull Opie aside and ask him to stop.  Yeah.  I was having a breakdown.  And the rest of us in the office were like, what the fuck is his problem?  Like he has to be like, he has to pull Opie aside and tell him to stop. 
[03:53:30]  We didn't even do anything.  I don't know.  That was a weird, that was a weird time.  Do you have any of the E-Rocktober clips?  Like the, what the Fs or anything?  Um, I think, what are you doing, Paul?  What is he doing in there?  What are you pointing at?  What's Paul pointing at?  I don't know.  Barack's going to take Ed's money.  Like Paul, we don't need to play Barack's going to take Ed's money.  It's got nothing to do with what we're talking about.  What's he pointing?  That's a sweeper just saying E-Rocktober.  That's not the thing.  Um, give me a moment. 
[03:54:00]  Let me see if I can find it.  Is Paul helping in there?  I guess so.  Yeah.  Hang on.  Uh-huh.  But yeah, I look back at some of that stuff and I was like, what the hell was going?  Like I still, to this day, I don't know what, with the E-Rocktober stuff, what was going  through my head as to why I was having a breakdown.  Yeah.  I would love to find like one of those, uh, uh, uh, what the Fs.  Because what we did for E-Rocktober was I, and Eric was pissed at me for a while over  it because Danny and me used the Wayback Machine on the internet where you can look up  archives of websites.  Like you put in a website and this thing, this, this site, you put in the URL and it 
[03:54:30]  will show you all the old versions of that website.  So we found E-Rock's URL for some website that he had stopped doing a while back.  My old radio show.  Right.  Yeah.  And so we found that URL and we put it into this thing and we got all his old stuff because  he used to write all, like all kinds of blogs and observations and even had a section on  his website called What the F.  What the F, yeah.  And he would list things that upset him. 
[03:55:00]  So as E-Rocktober began, and this was the predecessor to Jocktober, by the way, as E-Rocktober began,  um, we started making him read things from his old website and he flipped out.  Within a week of doing it, he completely flipped out.  Roland, were you around when this was going on?  Yeah.  He flipped out.  Did he not?  I thought he was going to kill you.  That one day where you went like, I think he's going to kill me.  I, and none of us knew what he was so mad about, but we were like, we, I wish I, I wish 
[03:55:30]  I had a better answer for you, but I, even now when I look at it, I just, I don't know  why I was so, but our, our, our thought on it was we have to keep pushing Eric until he  explodes so we can find out what he's so mad about.  Cause we will not let him.  What other logical explanation is there?  Oh, push these snaps.  Any luck?  No, but I can have some stuff for tomorrow.  What about right?  I don't know where, uh, some of this is.  You can't look up like, you're October. 
[03:56:00]  I'm looking, I'm doing searches right now.  I know we have it.  Yeah.  Paul, by the way, said that you were.  Here's one.  Oh, okay.  Good, good, good.  How long is this one?  Well, I mean, we can.  This is like seven minutes.  Give me a moment.  I'll scope through it.  Okay.  Because also right after we do this, I want to talk about what Paul said, because I was looking  for a bit that we didn't end up playing.  And Paul told me that Eric was not putting negative E-rock bits into the wet. 
[03:56:30]  He said, well, no, just worry about, worry about what the F for now.  And we'll get into this.  Pretend I'm not here, Eric.  Work on that task.  And I'll get into this in a minute.  You just scope through and find a good starting point.  We'll just listen to a couple minutes of what the F to bring everybody on board.  But Paul told me, because this is why I have this bit on CD, he told me that he was cutting  bits up for E-rock and the bits that were negative about E-rock, E-rock was not putting  into our system. 
[03:57:00]  So we wouldn't have access to them.  Luckily, Paul still had it on the computer.  And we'll talk to him about it in a minute.  I see Eric's already getting a little heated about it over there.  Oh, it too.  The accusation?  Well, I mean, I take Eric's side because, I mean, Paul said his mom's cooking was authentic.  Right.  And what did you think of it?  Bullshit.  Bullshit, right?  You didn't like that.  That's like Roland has now developed a reputation of he makes a mess in his office and then he 
[03:57:30]  tells the bosses somebody else did it.  And whether somebody else did it or not.  They did, those fuckers.  Nobody believes him anymore.  Everybody's just like, yeah, it's Roland.  Only Jesus.  He believes me.  Does he?  Yeah.  That's because you pray to him so much.  And by pray to him, I mean you use that excuse.  When you're napping in meetings.  I pray for Jesus.  We got a jump off point.  Maybe he's, oh, he's probably not paying attention.  Give me a second.  Hang on.  Okay.  He's not paying attention to me because he's, you know, I told him to.  I told him to put earmuffs on while we're talking about the Paul situation.  Wow, that's pretty ballsy of Paul. 
[03:58:00]  It was around the same time as Paul saying that he, Paul, he doesn't do it on the air, but  back in the office, back in the office.  He yaps.  He talks all kinds of shit about E-Rock and he says E-Rock doesn't give him credit.  And he says.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that one time he goes, I don't want E-Rock just to give me credit.  It's like, how hard does he tell the guys?  Yeah.  He says he doesn't give him credit.  He says E-Rock doesn't put E-Rock bits in the system because he doesn't want them played.  All kinds of accusations float around back there, but he doesn't do them on the air.  No.  And I tell him. 
[03:58:30]  He said he didn't call his shit out.  Yeah.  I'm like, look, I'm telling, I'm going to call it out.  And if you want justice, you should be the one calling it out.  We did a Yaman to get more shit out.  He's a fucking snake is what he is.  I guess.  Do you have a what the F for the people?  Everybody wants to hear what the F.  Yeah.  This is the, I guess it's the day that you found it.  Oh, great.  How long?  And is it just a quickie?  Uh, yeah, this is the best.  That's still three.  Minutes.  That's fine.  Three minutes is perfect.  All right.  Let's see.  See what this one does.  Okay.  Hey, Rocky, are you enjoying the what the F bit? 
[03:59:00]  Oh, thoroughly.  Yeah.  And by the way, 80s legend from Maine, he goes, what the F is up with this dumb ass segment?  Wake me up when it's over.  Did he put Z's?  I love that.  Oh, did he put the big yawn?  Sometimes with this show, you got to wait for it.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  If you listen to this program and you hear us doing a segment that you really think is  completely out of character and lame and stupid, perhaps there's a reason for it. 
[03:59:30]  Right.  You got to like hang out for the payoff.  You can't just take everything from this show at face value.  Do you honestly think we would be doing this with the F bit?  So just, just relax.  I mean, aside from the obvious, funny, like observational.  Oh, well, that's what I meant.  You know, it's hysterical.  It's what you're poking your head up.  What the F is with SpaghettiOs? 
[04:00:00]  What's the deal?  What's the deal with the sauce?  Three versions of SpaghettiOs?  Plain, hot dogs, and meatballs?  All three have different sauce.  You wouldn't know.  Plain's a bit on the bland side and thin in texture.  Hot dogs is very, very in capital letters, thin, but mildly spicy.  Meatballs is this thick, rich sauce which fills you up before you even finish the can.  Make a note of it.  What the F?  What the F?  I hate things that are all about the subject of food. 
[04:00:30]  What the fat, this should be called.  What the fat?  What the fat?  Oh, my God.  Oh, okay.  They've all been about some type of food.  Oh, that's why I don't have that one.  It's amazing.  What the F is a Pokemon? 
[04:01:00]  Want to catch my pocket monster?  Maybe it will Pikachu.  What the hell?  Oh, hold on.  No, no, no, no.  I got to put my coat on.  That, it will Pikachu?  Pikachu.  Well, the pocket, oh, pocket monster and Pikachu are both characters.  See, you see, a Pokemon is a pocket monster.  Yeah.  And Pikachu is a Pokemon. 
[04:01:30]  So, pocket monster will Pikachu.  It's a play on words is what it is.  Cool.  What the F?  What the F is with the video for the Christina Aguilera song, What a Girl Wants.  Notice the set?  It was taken from the 80s video for the Paula Abdul song, Cold-Hearted Snake.  What the F?  What fat girl wrote this?  Holy jeez.  No, I don't know.  Did you, who noticed that?  What type of pudgy homo would notice that? 
[04:02:00]  Well, here's the big reveal.  In honor of E-Rocktober.  E-Rocktober, everybody.  The boys found one of E-Rock's old websites.  Yes.  Good old pseudo radio, right, E-Rock?  Yep.  Oh, man, is he not in a good place.  Wait, when did you realize that it was something you had written?  When it was what, the F, or what?  Yeah, exactly when did it hit you like,  Oh, my God, they found this.  When I went into the office to try to get water, and they were all covering up really fast, whatever it is they had. 
[04:02:30]  Oh, Eric, that was worse than I remember.  Yeah.  Pikachu?  Pikachu.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pikachu.  You loved your play.  That was 2001.  You wanted to be a monologue writer for Letterman.  No.  You wanted to know, now, what do you think of the fact, now, you show a lot of balls, though, playing that bit for us here.  Yeah.  Paul says.  Yeah, Paul, Paul's, uh, Paul is slowly but surely becoming a piece of shit. 
[04:03:00]  Because he likes to sit there, I'll tell you this, I'll tell you that.  Won't confront you, won't say it on the air, or anything like that.  But his, I know what this is relating to.  He cuts up these little bits after Troy started yelling at him.  Now he feels like he needs to be productive, and he's going to cut up worst of stuff, right?  So he does, like, busy work.  So he cuts up all this shit, and I dump it into the FTP.  Some of it went up there, some of it didn't.  Where are these ones?  I don't know, I threw it all up there.  Oh, he's not putting bits into the system because they're about him. 
[04:03:30]  Okay, I ask.  Everything he's given me, I've dropped in, and it has loaded up in there.  Last week.  Yeah.  And Paul can come in here.  He's coming.  And Troy, too.  He's taking his sweet-ass time.  Yeah, it's all because Troy yelled at him.  Now he feels that he needs to do something.  Last week, I said that I wanted to play the call that they made to your hotel room while  you were on your honeymoon because that was the day, I think, I think it might have been  the day Troy wasn't here.  I don't know.  There was something related to people not being here, and it made complete sense that this 
[04:04:00]  is where kind of the shit really went down when Eric really got pissed because they called  him on his honeymoon in his hotel.  So I wanted to play the clip, and I asked for it.  And you weren't here.  That was your last sick day.  Maybe it was WrestleMania Monday.  Okay.  And you weren't here.  It was last Monday.  It was a week ago today.  And we couldn't find it in our system.  And then Paul said that he definitely cut it up, and then he burned it on CD, and then 
[04:04:30]  Paul said, E-Rock doesn't like putting in the bits that are his bits.  That's what he said to me.  Yeah.  Is that true?  No, it's not true.  Because everything he gave me got dumped into the system.  Well, I had asked about that, and I had noticed that the ones that didn't pop up in the system  happened to be all the ones I had cut up about you.  And I had voiced an opinion in the office, and I said, hey, this seems kind of weird. 
[04:05:00]  And then I was told, no, shut the fuck up and listen.  No, you're a funny piece of shit.  No, you're trying to get overly angry at fucking nothing.  I'm not trying to get overly angry.  Because I asked the office.  Uh-huh.  I said, hey, I noticed that these bits wound up in there, and these did not, and whatever.  And I was told that there was a history of that happening.  Uh-huh.  Of accusations.  Yeah.  But no, but Paul didn't say, didn't innocently come in and say, hey, guys.  Of course he didn't.  My buddy, E-Rock, da-da-da-da-da. 
[04:05:30]  Look, these are the bits that didn't pop up.  Why do you guys think they're not in there?  And then me, Danny, and Travis said, uh-oh, that E-Rock, he always keeps his bits.  And then Paul said, oh, you guys really think so?  Paul.  Well, all right, maybe not have been as innocent as that.  You, you, you, somehow, when you're in the office, you have a big old dick that you  swing around.  Well, I'm agrier at certain points than at others.  And you give your opinion about E-Rock and his work ethic, and what do you know?  Hey, everyone else feels free to attack E-Rock.  Whoa, whoa, I'll just join the party.  Don't settle the fuck down, because I don't say bad things about Eric in the back office. 
[04:06:00]  No, you just say it behind my back all the time.  All right, really?  Why are we discussing this on the air, then?  He does.  Because Sam brought it up.  Yeah, because you lie.  He says things in the back office, but he doesn't, but he, I admit, you think this is  what it is, E-Rock, because you said, oh, everybody, you think it's that, like, there's  an attack E-Rock mentality in the office, so it's a little easier for Paul to get on board  with that than when he has to carry the reins.  No, I don't think anybody was attacking.  I think he just decided to jump in and try to stir shit up, because he's like, oh, I'll 
[04:06:30]  go after E-Rock.  That's the easy thing to do here, and everyone will like me.  But then when he has to actually confront you on it...  He doesn't do it.  He won't say anything to my face.  Oh, wow.  No.  You do sing a different tone in the office.  It's all because Troy smacked his pee-pee, and he's all upset.  Is that what happened?  No, that's not what happened at all.  Oh, really?  Ask anybody else around here.  Wow, Paul's actually doing a whole bunch of stuff.  Why?  Because Troy yelled at him on the air.  I mean, it did whip me into shape.  It did whip me into shape.  Yeah. 
[04:07:00]  Unfortunately.  I don't disagree with that at all.  I'm not saying it's a negative thing.  I'm saying you're doing stuff because Troy yelled at you.  I feel about Troy, they're yelling at you.  I already said what I feel about Troy.  But I got no problem.  You've also said what you feel about E-Rock, but it's different in here than it is back there.  No.  Of course it is.  No, it's not.  Eric and I have been getting along splendidly later.  Apparently not.  Yeah, but that's because you don't tell him how you feel.  We have.  And that's the problem.  You wouldn't be getting along splendidly if he was back there listening to what you say about him. 
[04:07:30]  But I do say, like, I have no problem saying shit to E-Rock about E-Rock.  You know, like, that doesn't bother me at all.  But you don't say it.  You don't say that he, you know, keeps his bits out of the system.  First of all, I asked him about it, why those were the ones that didn't show up.  And Eric gave me the reason of, well, I don't know if they'll make sense in the context that I cut them.  But, you know, and yeah.  All right.  That's another thing, too.  Paul turns to drop it, not just my shit, drops it in the middle of a conversation where it's like, why are we playing it from here? 
[04:08:00]  He's singing a different tone, isn't he?  You know what he's doing, don't you, Eric?  You've been around the block.  He's working.  But the fact that, look, this is number two now.  Last week it was, you know, I gave him song suggestions, but I'm not getting credited on the air.  And now I'm cutting out material, but my material's not being played.  No.  No.  First of all, giving you the song suggestions and not getting credit, I misrepresented myself.  What annoyed me was when you faked telling Sam about it.  And when I had asked Sam about it because I didn't see the light light up.  That's bullshit, but whatever. 
[04:08:30]  A lot of misrepresentation around here, Roland.  Listen.  Wow.  We need to get to a place where there won't be misrepresentation.  And that's the Ron and Fetishow.  They're going to be coming up next.  Live.  Live, live, live.  I hope Pepper Hicks is back.  He wasn't here yesterday.  He's back.  He's back.  Zito covered.  We'll be back.  Zito wasn't here yesterday either.  He was.  No, he wasn't.  I was listening to Ron and Fetishow.  We'll be back with more of this.  He was.  Tomorrow.  Roland just makes it up and stands by it.  Goodbye, everybody.  Don't comment.
