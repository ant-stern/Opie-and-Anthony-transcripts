<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a post-Academy Awards recap, filled with crude jokes targeting celebrities' appearances (Jennifer Lopez's nipples, Julia Roberts' mouth, Angelina Jolie's sexuality, Bjork's outfit) and performances.  Steve Martin's hosting and Joan Rivers' commentary were heavily criticized.  Russell Crowe's win and perceived arrogance fueled speculation about his sexual orientation, accompanied by numerous sexually suggestive comments. The hosts contrasted the Oscars' perceived dullness with the violent return of *The Sopranos*, which they praised extensively.  A recurring bit compared celebrities to their supposedly less successful or "retarded" siblings. Mario Cantone called in, adding his comedic commentary on the Oscars and Joan Rivers.  The show also heavily promoted their "Best Ass Contest" on WNEW.com, acknowledging website technical difficulties.

The broadcast continued with a rant by Opie about his local sports radio station’s poor coverage of the Tiger Woods tournament, using highly offensive racial slurs.  He contrasted the station’s choice of interview subjects (Jeff Ruland and John Calipari) with his desire for tournament updates.  This transitioned into a scathing critique of WNEW, labeled a "clusterf*ck," focusing on management's perceived incompetence regarding advertising (a poorly placed Times Square billboard) and operational issues (unreviewed sponsor copy).  A bizarre incident involving an oversized car sunshade was recounted.  The hosts then returned to a detailed, graphic discussion of the previous night's *Sopranos* episode, speculating on plot points and a potential character death.  Numerous listener calls added to this discussion, some echoing frustrations with WNEW and others offering dubious information about *Sopranos* filming.  The segment ended with the hosts struggling to remove large microphone flags, leading to more frustration and expletives.

The show next featured a discussion about *The Sopranos*, focusing on Meadow's relationship and a possible lesbian subplot.  A fake audio clip of Tony Soprano listening to a recording of Meadow having sex was played.  This segued into a discussion of Brian Regan's stand-up performance at Caroline's, with in-studio guests Jay Moore, Dr. Bob, Stephen Lynch, and Jim Brewer recounting disruptive audience members.  A phone call with Matt, the assistant to the hypnotist who followed Regan, sparked a debate about the authenticity of the hypnotist's act.  Dr. Bob then promoted his book and video, *The One-Hour Orgasm*, leading to sexually explicit conversations and jokes about prolonged sexual activity with listener participation.

This discussion about prolonged orgasms continued with Dr. Bob detailing specific techniques, including spreading fingers and toes and combining lip and genital stimulation.  Linda, a listener, shared a positive experience using the techniques. Rich made a joke about Jeff Goldblum.  The conversation took a peculiar turn with calls from Mario Polite, a *Sopranos* actor who played a rapist, and Bubba Ray Dudley, who verified Polite's identity.  Denny Moore, the hypnotist, defended his act. Stephen Lynch’s new verse to the Special Olympics song was played. A Joey Paisano’s restaurant commercial aired.  A 17-year-old listener, Crystal, sought advice on whether to become a stripper, prompting suggestive conversation from the hosts.  Jay Moore, Mike DiNicola, and Stephen Lynch were in the studio throughout this portion. The show concluded with sound effects and further banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is what I said to you, I forget.  Oh, wow.  Charcoal paquette. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, I'm holding you on.  You're good, so.  It's the O&A Show.  Rick getting a couple more there.  212-757-1027 is our phone number, yes.  I mean, let's get right into this.  The Sopranos rocked last night.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that had a lot to do with the Academy Awards.  Besides the Academy Awards, they're sucking, getting the lowest rating in many years. 
[00:01:00]  That's where the Sopranos did?  I think so.  You know, it's right in the middle of the Academy Awards there, and the Sopranos are on.  But see, that doesn't matter, because the Sopranos are on pretty much every day of the week.  It's on tonight at 10 if you missed a matter of fact.  If you missed it, and I like catching it right when it comes on.  I don't want anyone to reen it.  And, you know, you ought to watch it right when it comes on, because we'll reen it for you.  See, last night I made the stupid call.  I'm like, I've got to watch the Academy Awards.  Everyone else is watching it so we can talk about it on our show. 
[00:01:30]  And that was the biggest bore fest ever.  Yeah, you want to stick around maybe for the best picture, best actor, best actress.  Everything else is crap.  Who cares best score in a friggin' documentary?  Score, how about sound editing?  Best sound editing.  And then they've got to pump up how important sound editing is.  Yeah, we know.  And how do you decide?  Yeah.  That was great edit.  Yeah, exactly.  And the sound editor's like, I want an Oscar.  You know, I'm right there. 
[00:02:00]  Russell Crowe did what he did.  But I also have one.  But you know what?  I mean, they say people take it serious when they vote and stuff.  These guys can't make the decision, you know, which picture had better sound editing.  So they do what we would probably do.  Like what you do with the Best Ass Contest.  Eh, I don't know.  Get rid of her.  Keep her.  Yeah, keep her.  Get rid of that.  You know?  It's just pure luck that you win an Oscar for sound editing. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  I was very surprised at Gladiator, by the way.  I thought it was too cool of a movie for the Uptight Academy to actually give it an award.  I thought Crouching Tiger's Hidden Dragon would have won Best Picture.  Crouching Tiger.  Now, you know why?  Eh, not American enough.  Yeah, but they give, I don't know, those foreign films, they sneak in there every year.  Listen to me.  It's an Australian actor in a movie about Rome.  And I'm saying it's not American enough. 
[00:03:00]  But it was made in America.  I know what you're saying.  Yeah.  A lot of those films, you know, made somewhere else, and they kind of sneak in there a little bit.  Yeah.  But I'm glad to see Gladiator won.  I mean, great movie.  Russell Crowe.  Jesus Christ, this guy.  Can Russell Crowe look any gayer?  The gays love him.  I guess he, you know, he wanted to, like, get some of the women to leave him alone.  Because the rumor in Hollywood is that he's banging everybody.  But the gays love him.  Well, he's not into the gays.  Here it is when he came up to accept his award. 
[00:03:30]  Howdy!  A faggot?  What do you have?  Some kind of, what do you call that haircut?  A pompadour?  I don't know what it is.  Is it a pompadour?  Is that what it is?  It's a pompadour.  I don't know what the hell is it.  It had kind of like a ducktail pompadour thing happening.  Yeah.  A little retro.  It's going back to the 50s or something.  Maybe he was getting bored with all the women loving his ass, so he decided, you know  what, I'll just get the faggiest haircut, and that'll get rid of some of the people  that follow me around.  So was the Best Actor award the last thing that the devil was entitled to give him? 
[00:04:00]  Because now does he have to cash in his soul?  Jesus Christ, this guy.  He's banging every starlet in Hollywood.  And now he's got an Oscar.  And it's an Oscar for the film that also won Best Picture.  Yeah.  It was a bore fest.  And Steve Martin blew.  He had a couple funny jokes here and there, but in general, he sucked.  That's a little done, I think.  That's a little over with.  You know, I don't like him, but he does a good job. 
[00:04:30]  Might as well give Billy Crystal whatever the F he wants and just say, you're the lifetime  host of the Oscars.  Because they try everyone else, and they just fail in comparison to Billy Crystal.  I think, though, the Billy Crystal thing, it would just be the same thing.  All right, he's doing his little movie parody.  But that's all they want.  Yeah.  That's all they want.  Yeah, I guess once a year, it's okay.  Who was the hottest woman there?  Oh, this just coming in.  Russell Crowe had the Kenickie from Grease, Airda.  Kenickie, yeah.  It was the Kenickie.  Yeah, that's good. 
[00:05:00]  That's a good reference.  The Kenickie.  Who was the hottest chick there?  A Hickey from Kenickie's like a Hallmark card.  The hottest chick?  Um, jeez, I don't know.  Julia Roberts.  Julia Roberts had the big cans and everything.  She doesn't have big cans.  But, well, they looked good.  And then she had them pushed up a little bit.  Bajork's dress.  Oh, my God.  What's going on with Bajork?  Bajork. 
[00:05:30]  Bajork.  And someone interviewed her, I think it was before ABC's coverage.  Not that, uh, Joan Rivers and Melissa Rivers.  God.  Yeah.  Hollywood is filled with a bunch of pussies.  Yeah, yeah.  Why doesn't one person mouth off to that human skeleton?  She's mouthing off to everyone else.  She's the critic for what everyone looks like.  See, they all know that they're all going to get trashed when she does her little special,  you know, Oscars wrap-up show a week from now. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, look at you.  Would you get that out of the hamper?  Eww.  Shut up.  They all kiss her ass.  No one talks back to Joan Rivers.  Like a friggin' latex glove over her skull.  That it's gotten.  When, when, was she born in China?  With those eyes?  My God.  Well, now she's got to wear the sunglasses just to kind of hide the fact that her eyes  have been pulled a little too tightly.  They're pulled back.  She looks like that alien from the X-Files.  Yeah.  The big alien eyes. 
[00:06:30]  And Melissa, too.  She don't go criticizing anybody.  And no one in Hollywood has the balls to tell Melissa Rivers that the only reason she  has a job is because she's Joan's daughter.  Yeah.  That's just flat-out pathetic.  The lady has no business being anywhere near a red carpet.  No.  No.  At least her mom was, you know, funny in her day and she was a comedian and stuff.  Yeah, now she's just because she's the daughter.  She's lasted way too long.  I mean, but at least she had something going on.  Just because she's her daughter. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  Let's go to the phones.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say, here's last night the scenario.  Ready?  Yeah.  Oscars.  Oh, nine o'clock.  Sopranos.  Right.  Click.  Goodbye.  I mean, the show was pathetic.  And is it me?  Every time the camera cut, you thought you were in Chinatown.  Wow.  Was he giving away free one-ton and egg rolls with the Oscars behind the scenes or something?  The whole Crouching Tiger crew. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Crouching Tiger.  They took over like the first ten rows.  Oh.  They had a whole little thing going on there.  You're right.  Usually you pop one of pretzels with the Oscars.  Last night I ordered lo mein.  Yeah.  You know, I got a little chicken and broccoli.  Kevin, I suffered through the entire Oscars.  Terrible.  It's hard.  I mean, next year we're going to have subtitles in English for these goops.  None of the women that got on stage, you know, there wasn't enough, you know, boobage  showing or anything.  And Jennifer Lopez, let me tell you something.  I'm glad she wasn't nominated. 
[00:08:00]  You know why?  She would melt that Oscar down and turn it into a golden hubcap.  Thank you.  Neil Flaps loves you.  Thank you, Kevin.  You know what?  I never thought I'd say this, but Jennifer Lopez, what a broad.  She's got the ugliest nipples I've ever seen through a class.  Wow.  Anyone else see that?  Dude.  Oh, now I got to say.  You know my favorite nipple, right?  My favorite nipple, they have to be a little on the large, larger side, not like taking  over the whole boob.  Right.  Medium, let's say. 
[00:08:30]  Medium.  You don't like the Madonna nips.  No.  Yeah, the Madonna nips are those little, looks like a kid nip on a big boob.  I like the medium nips that have the slow fade.  You know what the slow fade is?  The slow fade around the edge, so it's not such a stark difference in color.  It just kind of fades into the regular skin.  I love that.  Yeah.  Jennifer Lopez had what we like to call the Hershey Kisses.  Oh.  They just like plonk, plonk.  There's a pop down there.  Well, you know what Habil calls that?  Oh.  There's the nip, the fade, it's called the welded on. 
[00:09:00]  I like the welded on.  Because it's welded on.  Okay.  You know, it fades, it becomes part of the boob.  And then the other one is the riveted on.  It's just kind of riveted on there, brother.  You need the welded.  It's Mr. Potato Head nip.  Just pop those babies on there.  Yeah.  You don't want those.  Man, I...  Ugh.  And did you see what's-his-facey there from Black Crowes?  Chris Robinson?  Chris Robinson.  Hanging out with the friggin' Hollywood guy. 
[00:09:30]  He's talking with Kurt Rochdahl.  It's like, oh, he's one of the Hollywood guys now.  If that doesn't wreck your credibility for your band.  Oh.  You know, and I have to say it.  I'm one of the hugest Black Crowe fans you'll ever meet.  But I'm sitting there like, ugh.  They don't really need the street cred, though.  You know.  No, I know, but...  What are you doing?  He looks...  He looks really out of place.  He looks out of place.  No one will...  He was all F-double, stoned.  They were doing all the interviews, and no one was paying attention to him.  Yeah.  You know, that's got to be rough, man. 
[00:10:00]  We should start a pool.  How long does it take before those two break up?  He's Mr. Goldie Hawn's daughter.  Because she isn't even her name.  She's Goldie Hawn's daughter.  Yeah.  Mr. Goldie Hawn's daughter.  That's good, though.  Billy, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Oh, man.  I forgot I was going to say...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, geez.  Oh, yeah.  Was Rick upset that Chocolat didn't win for Best Picture?  She was crying when I came in.  Why Chocolat? 
[00:10:30]  Chocolat.  Opie.  Yeah.  Goldie Hawn of the daughter.  Who do you bang?  And you know what?  Obviously Kate Hudson, but Goldie Hawn.  I mean, she's 54, I think.  She's in her friggin' 50s, and you got to say...  She looked great.  Nice.  All right.  I'm going to go spank you.  Take care, guys.  There you go.  You know, when I'm 85 and my wife is 54, I'm going to be pretty psyched to bang that.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm kind of surprised that Russell Crowe and Gladiator won also.  All right. 
[00:11:00]  I don't think she's gay enough.  You know, I mean, real quick, I'm not surprised, because there really wasn't a lot of great movies  this past year.  No.  That hasn't been said with all this Oscar talk that you watch.  Yeah, that's true, but the Oscars are won by all the fagulas.  The fagulas.  Right.  That's why he won.  That's why they pushed Kevin Spacey, because allegedly that he is gay.  Tom Hanks, big liberal.  I mean, they didn't have any real liberal enough or gay enough people this year.  Not that there's anything wrong with that. 
[00:11:30]  All right.  I don't even know who else was up for best actor.  Oh, Tom Hanks.  Tom Hanks.  That wasn't his best performance.  Who else?  I don't even know.  I don't even know.  I don't care.  Oh, Ed Harris.  Thank you, buddy.  The movie that no one saw that Ed Harris was in.  What was the movie called?  Pollock?  And what does he play in this movie?  Can someone help me out?  He's an artist.  Artist?  He's in some kind of mental institute or something.  Yeah.  He's like a wacky artist guy.  Like an insane guy.  Ed, what's going on? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Benicio Del Toro.  Best appointed actor?  Yeah.  The Wolfman and Buster Poindexter had a love child.  See this guy?  He looks like Brad Pitt's ugly brother.  Oh, God.  Remember those talk shows where they used to bring the brothers out of the famous people?  The famous one is Patrick Swayze and his brother.  Right.  Like Patrick Swayze was in all these really huge movies, big blockbuster movies back in the 80s and stuff. 
[00:12:30]  And his brother turns up like on T.J. Hooker as one of the crooks.  Get in the car, scum.  I got you, freak scum.  And it's his brother who kind of looked like him only with one chromosome off.  Tom Hanks' brother is a perfect example.  Tom Hanks.  Yeah, there's Tom Hanks winning Academy Awards.  And Tom Hanks' brother had a little guest spot in Days of Our Lives once that I'll walk on.  And, you know, the guy's normal, but everyone's so used to seeing Tom Hanks  that when you see his brother, you're like, wow, that's what Tom Hanks would look like if he was retarded. 
[00:13:00]  If he was retarded.  Isn't that awful?  Play that game next time.  Yeah.  I mean, Patrick Swayze's a perfect example as well.  But now Patrick Swayze's kind of looking like his brother now.  Oof.  He's not watching.  Let's go to Dano.  Dano, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, Owen A?  How you guys doing?  All right.  Now, okay, maybe Russell Crowe was banging every chick in Hollywood,  and maybe he got nominated for all this stuff, won all these awards,  but he is just such a tool.  I mean, he was, like, walking around like his ass don't stink. 
[00:13:30]  It doesn't.  In Hollywood today, he's the guy.  It just pisses me off, though.  I mean, oh, you just want to hit him.  Well, Steve Martin was pretty brave with some of those jokes that he threw at Russell Crowe,  and Russell wouldn't even crack a smile.  Really?  Yeah, like that.  He had, like, a stick of his A.  All right.  It was also, like, it was also kind of weird the way he was, like, congratulating everybody.  I mean, you think he'd be a little bit more happy for them?  He was just like, all right, yeah, that's good.  You won.  You know?  All right.  All right.  Peace, guys.  Thank you.  Doesn't anyone remember virtuosity? 
[00:14:00]  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's happening?  Hey.  Kate Hudson looked phenomenal.  What is she doing with that Chris Robinson dude?  Smoking lots of pot.  Smoking the weed.  Chris Robinson.  You guys were talking.  Now, Goldie Hawns, her mother?  Yeah.  Oh.  I didn't know that.  You never knew that.  Never knew that.  I was trying to figure out last night who Kate Hudson was.  You only mentioned it a thousand times in the last two weeks.  I'm a little out of touch, I guess.  All right. 
[00:14:30]  Thanks, guys.  Who's her father?  We were trying to remember the first.  Is it Mark Hudson?  Wasn't it one of the Hudson brothers?  Yeah.  What were their first names, though?  God, I can't even remember.  From laughing?  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, what's going on?  Brian?  Yeah.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey, listen.  I just wanted to talk about Russell Crowe again.  Did you guys see the thing he had on his neck?  Almost like a tie, but it looks like he took a piece of twine and wrapped it around his neck. 
[00:15:00]  I didn't notice that.  No, it was just adding the little gaydar effect.  Oh, okay.  Rick's showing me.  Yeah, it's the fancy bow tie, the alternative to the bow tie.  Is that what you're supposed to wear when you're gay and everybody gives you a hug?  I don't know what they're trying to do in Hollywood, man.  I would just show up with just the nice tux.  They try to fancy it up and stuff, you know?  No, no.  Just a pair of jeans and one of those tux t-shirts.  Get up there, tell everybody off you don't like, and go home. 
[00:15:30]  There you have it.  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  Have a good one, guys.  All right.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  First thing I wanted to ask you, who are you wearing today?  No one had the balls to say anything to Joan Rivers.  God, ooh, is she going to beat you up?  What's that you got on?  What do you call that?  Shut up, you skeleton.  Get back in the tomb.  And Joan Rivers is a pussy, too, because, you know, some of those Hollywood starlets walked  up to her, and they obviously looked horrible, and Joan's going to, like, trash them in a 
[00:16:00]  week when she does her post-show.  But in front of them, she's like, oh, you look lovely tonight.  What are you wearing?  I wanted to get your opinion on your old friend.  Who?  Sarah Jessica Parker.  Ruth Buzzi.  What did you think of her?  Oh, yeah.  Ruth Buzzi in a really nice dress.  Actually, she looked pretty good yesterday.  Ruth Buzzi's daughter.  Ruth Buzzi in a nice dress.  Like that SNL bit with all the laughing people's kids when Kate Hudson hosted?  That's what it looked like.  Ruth Buzzi's daughter.  Well, she looks a lot better than she does in that show verse. 
[00:16:30]  Eric, she's got some mileage on her now.  I mean, you know, I don't care if she calls again to defend herself.  Yep.  She looked like Ruth Buzzi in a dress.  A nice dress.  I don't see it with her.  She had the hairnet on like Ruth Buzzi in a bag and she's hitting the guy next to her.  Jason, what's going on?  Did you guys not see Bob Dylan?  He looked like freaking Vincent Price.  Did you not see that?  Yes, I did, man.  Bob Dylan.  What was that all about? 
[00:17:00]  The guy looked like the 20-year-old white lab mice.  Something like that.  You know, the one they gave the stuff to and he's outliving his brethren.  Well, something like Salvador Dali.  He's outliving the cancer they injected in him.  Unbelievable.  I have another question for you guys.  Yeah.  I was at the Vanderbilt the other night, your little show, and I saw who was that freak with the big boobs.  What was that all about?  Oh, Mistress Rhiannon.  What did you pay her?  Nothing, man.  She's what she is.  Did you like the flashlight trick? 
[00:17:30]  I was just scared to help my wife right out here today.  I'm sorry, but I had to leave.  I had to leave.  All right, Jason.  Hanging up because you're listening to yourself.  Have a good day.  All right.  Screws up the whole flow.  Don't do that.  No.  Emma, what's going on?  Hey.  Just so you guys know, the movie Pollock is about the life of Jackson Pollock.  It's not like you really care, but that's important.  Wait, wait, Emma.  No, teach us.  I don't even know what that means.  Jackson Pollock, he's like a 20th century artist, like modern artist.  He was like crazy and whatever.  Ed Harris did this amazing performance as Jackson Pollock in the movie. 
[00:18:00]  And the woman who played his wife won Best Supporting Actress.  Right, I know that.  Okay.  Yeah, so that, you know, whatever.  Well, that was the upset because that was Kate Hudson's award.  Yeah, exactly.  We're all expecting beautiful Kate Hudson to win and no deal.  But the other thing is that Joan Rivers actually says to the woman from Crouching Tiger, there's so many Asians here.  There's so many Asians.  It's so international this year.  And the woman's looking at her like she's freaking crazy.  Great.  I love the chinks.  What are you wearing?  Who are you wearing?  Is that a Chong Fung? 
[00:18:30]  Exactly.  Who are you wearing?  Who are you wearing?  Who are you wearing?  What freaking corpse did you pull that skin off of?  She was horrible.  She was horrible.  Who are you wearing?  I'm wearing Edgar.  That's who I'm wearing.  It's my husband Edgar.  I pulled his body out of the cork and stretched his decaying skin over.  That's who I'm wearing.  Michelle Yeoh didn't even know who she was.  She was like, who is this disgusting corpse talking to me?  I don't care.  Cool.  Thanks, Emma.  No problem.  All right. 
[00:19:00]  You're wearing a little clay board.  I'm wearing a head head gun.  Look at this.  I have a penis.  It came with the suit.  Looks like she stretches scrotum around her neck, though.  That's what I'm using in scrotum for extra neck.  Extra neck meat.  Jack, what's going on?  Yeah, guys, you were talking about Hollywood Brothers.  Yeah.  How about Ron Howard and Clint?  Oh, is that?  That doesn't even look like a retarded Ron Howard. 
[00:19:30]  It doesn't look like a retarded.  No, that's like all.  I mean, we're talking with like the adopted retarded brothers.  Doesn't Clint look like Chaka from Land of the Lost?  Later, guys.  All right.  Yeah, that's all the way retarded right there.  With Hank's brother and Patrick Swayze's brother, it's just a little off.  Right.  A little retarded.  You can tell they're brothers.  Right.  But, yeah, Clint Howard, that's all the way.  That's funny.  All right.  We've got to take our first break, Anthony. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  People still have some great comments about the Oscars.  We'll stay with that for a little while.  Sopranos talk.  And best use of a friggin' putty.  A putter.  Last night on the Sopranos.  You want to give an award there.  Best use of a putter.  Finally, the violence is back on the Sopranos.  Nice.  Hey, I like a good storyline like anyone, but, man, you know, the Sopranos was getting soft  there for a little while.  Yeah, you know, they need to bash in some heads, and I think they finally did that.  Put it out there last night.  Boss, well, I guess we should tell people right off the bat, the ten finalists in the 
[00:20:30]  best-ass contest are up on WNEW.com.  You can start your voting.  Ladies that entered the contest, thank you, thank you, thank you, but we can only pick  ten as finalists, so ten had to go away, and it was a tough decision.  A lot of the guys around here, you know, voted and helped us narrow it down.  Well, yeah, let's make that clear, Opie.  We call everyone in the back, and we go through these pictures, very painstaking, and we pick 
[00:21:00]  the finalists, so it's no one person here that gets to pick the finalists.  Right.  These were arrived at by all of us conferring in the office before the show.  Right, but start your voting at WNEW.com, okay, and you can see the ten finalists.  We'll be back.  Phone calls at 212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony, it's the kind of show where you can feel up your sister, feel up your  sister, feel up your sister. 
[00:21:30]  Opie and Anthony.  You guys are awesome.  It's like, I got a little kid, it's like a drug.  1027-WNEW.  I want to get these guys in the studio, man.  Buck Sherry?  I am.  A young Steven Tyler with blonde hair.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Give us a call. 
[00:22:00]  Dave, what's going on?  What's happening, fellas?  I got a couple of observations on last night's fiasco.  All right.  The first one is Joan Rivers, die.  The second one is Academy Award, people.  Nobody gives a rat's ass about the long, short, medium, animated documentary.  You can cut the show down by three hours if you cut that crap out.  Yeah, why are you giving an award out for something that 99.9% of the country never saw? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, I heard about.  Short animated documentary feature with...  That's all those insiders.  ...with a retard in it.  I don't know.  They just sit there and say, oh, look, I won this Oscar.  And why are they giving out an award for sound editing?  How about Angelina Jolie?  Cut your head off and you're a perfect 10.  I don't know.  I think she's pretty hot, but...  Oh, what a body.  No face.  I think she plays for the other team, though.  Uh-oh.  I mean, pantsuit at the Oscar.  If that doesn't say it all right there. 
[00:23:00]  How would you like to play with her pants?  Yeah.  She plays for the other team, though.  I'm telling you.  All right, dude.  Take it easy.  All right.  I know.  I think Gabe was trying to be funny.  I know.  Now someone's going to call up and say, no, pants...  You know, pantsuits are hot.  I like the pantsuit on a gal.  Like, for those Hollywood starlets, the most glamorous day of their careers and their lives  is the Oscars.  Yeah.  So would you go into your closet and pick out a pantsuit for that event? 
[00:23:30]  A pantsuit?  No.  You know, you've got to go with the gown.  It's wonderful.  Pantsuits are worn by aunts at weddings because they can't fit in the dresses anymore.  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Last night, Sopranos rocked.  Yeah, we'll get into that in a little bit.  Yeah.  All right.  Then I'll give you some Oscar stuff.  Does Willem Dafoe look like the freaking mannequin?  The puppet from Magic?  You know, the thing with William Dafoe, that was kind of funny. 
[00:24:00]  No.  When they were doing Best Makeup, they showed him getting dressed up as, like, Dracula.  He didn't need makeup.  That's what I was thinking.  I'm like, wow, that's not really a stretch, you know?  One more, one more and I'm out.  Yeah.  Joaquin Phoenix.  Nice head, dick.  He combed his hair with a weed whacker.  Hey, that's in, though, you know?  Yeah, look in.  Instant feedback is Tony on every freaking show.  Suck it, you jackasses.  Thank you, Tony.  Later, guys. 
[00:24:30]  All right.  Let's move on to Ron.  Ron, what's up?  Hey, what's going on there, guys?  Hey.  Great road show on Friday.  Looks like I won the famous brothers there.  Yeah, guys.  What's that?  Yeah.  Sylvester Stallone and his brother Frank.  Another example of the retarded brother.  Yeah.  We talked about a freak show in that family.  I hope people understand this little observation of ours.  Yeah, Frank Stallone is like Sly Stallone if he was retarded.  What about the Mother Jackie? 
[00:25:00]  Mother Jackie.  That's a whole different story.  Yeah, she has some psychic hopper.  All right.  Thank you, Ron.  All right.  All right, man.  Wonderful.  Julia Roberts.  She's wearing a vintage Valentino gown.  I'm wearing Valentino.  Rudolph Valentino.  Talk about, look, it's a corpse.  I have a Versace on.  Actually, it's Versace.  Robert, what's going on?  Guys, I would pay...  That white beard I'm using for views. 
[00:25:30]  Robert, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I would pay good money to sniff Julia Roberts' Oscar this morning.  You see the head on that gold thing?  You got to think at least one person in Hollywood is using that in the bedroom.  You know what's funny?  Is it me or does Tom Hanks look like Mr. Whipple?  Don't squeeze the toilet paper.  He's getting kind of strange looking.  Hey, that's pretty good.  You know what's so funny? 
[00:26:00]  A week before the Oscars, it's Tom Hanks, Tom Hanks, Tom Hanks.  Today, in every paper, there's a little picture of Tom like the size of a stamp on every page.  Yeah, he didn't win.  Hank got yanked, baby.  He wasn't using his acting chops in Cast Away.  There wasn't much there.  It was a good movie, but...  The pig on Survivor did a better job than Tom Hanks in Cast Away.  All right, man.  Hey, putting Opie and Anthony in front of a microphone is like putting a steak knife in O.J.'s hands.  Greg, you're next on WNEW. 
[00:26:30]  Hey, guys.  How are you?  I was just wondering if you saw the best moment for me, at least at the Oscars,  was when Julia Roberts turned around and made that octamaroon, her boyfriend,  come hit her and help her up to the podium because her dress was too big.  Oh, yeah?  I was too busy looking at her boobs and her face.  Do you really think she's that good looking?  I think she's, yeah.  Without a doubt.  I think she's 30 years away from being Elizabeth Taylor. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, who isn't?  Yeah, I know.  How about, um...  What?  Right.  What?  How about Sigourney Weaver?  She looked like something right out of Munsters.  She really did.  And then Joan Rivers is like, you know, praising her.  Six foot three, I expected her to say, you rag.  Thank you, Greg.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Let's go to Vinny.  Vinny, what's up?  Hey, Vinny.  Hey, yo. 
[00:27:30]  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, yo.  All right.  Sorry, gentlemen.  I'm sitting here getting ready for happy hour.  Thanks.  I'm setting up the bar.  Listen.  Pick up the...  Pick up the...  On speaker phone?  Yeah, pick up the phone.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, man.  For years in L.A. it was rumored that Jodie Foster the next day went around bragging that  she did pleasure herself with the Oscar the night she won.  Nice.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  For years.  Because, you know, she is definitely on the other team, but that ain't public.  That's for sure.  Hey, you know what we should do? 
[00:28:00]  What's that?  Can we get, like, a statue and have the Oscar award challenge instead of the whistleball  bat challenge?  We'd have to have somebody make up an Oscar.  That would work for me.  Just don't play any Oscar award-winning music in the background.  You got it.  Included Sting.  Losers.  Losers.  All right, Tom.  You guys suck.  Who are the bands that I played?  Anybody?  The live performances?  Sting.  I know.  Hitchcock.  What's his name?  The violin player there.  The fiddle player.  Oh, Yo-Yo Ma?  Yo-Yo Ma. 
[00:28:30]  Or Mo-Mo-Ya.  And Itzcock.  Wait, wait.  Itzack Perlman.  You can pronounce his name?  Itzack Perlman.  Itzack.  Yeah, look at that.  I'm cultured.  You're cultured, yeah.  Go have a no-hit.  Like yogurt.  The weed.  He's cultured.  Yeah, Sting.  The small people guy who never wins anything, but is nominated every year.  Randy Newman.  Randy Newman.  Ah.  But York with the swan outfit.  What about the Bengals chick singing with Randy Newman? 
[00:29:00]  She looked hot.  She looked hot, but the song was so out of her range, she was just like, ah, ah, it's not  like a retard trying to sing it.  Really?  I think you're stretching, man.  I didn't think it was that bad.  From the Bengals?  What's her name?  Suzanne Hoff.  Yeah, Suzanne Hoff.  Hops.  Hops.  Hops.  Hops.  Hops.  Hops, I think.  Hops.  Hops.  That should look really good.  I thought you meant the guitar player.  That's all.  Right there.  That guy? 
[00:29:30]  That dude.  Chris, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  I just wanted to tell you, I made an observation the other night.  Michael Jackson and Bjork.  I think they're the same person.  That's not bad.  Bajork.  Bajork.  They look great.  Come on.  Look at your eyes.  She's just a freak of nature, too.  All right, guys.  I want to see what's in her face.  All right.  Thanks.  Goodbye.  I can't get past that Julia Roberts mouth.  You can't get past it.  It's too distracting. 
[00:30:00]  It's like three swans, no waiting.  She's got kidney mouth.  What?  I mean, if she walked in that door, you'd babble.  She is.  She ain't doing it.  She ain't doing it, dude.  I think she's hotter than Kate Hudson.  No.  No.  What are you doing, crack?  I think she's hotter than Kate Hudson.  It's distracting.  Like, the big mouth is distracting.  She talks, and all I'm seeing is that mouth I want to try to cast into it with a lure.  I don't know. 
[00:30:30]  You guys are picky.  No.  It's not being picky or anything.  That's kind of a stress to say that she's.  So what?  You think she's ugly?  No, I'm not saying ugly.  I'm saying the mouth is distracting.  I can't concentrate on any other attributes she might have because of the big mouth.  All right.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening?  Hey.  The hottest thing was that Pepsi commercial with Britney Spears.  Yeah.  You know what?  You're not going to see anything hotter on regular TV ever, ever, ever than that commercial 
[00:31:00]  they showed.  Do you just want to pin her down and...  The commercial was just beyond ridiculous.  Did you see it, Anthony?  No.  It's beyond ridiculous.  It's a commercial, and it should be on foundrymusic.com, and it should be playing, like, on a loop.  Because it's just...  There are hundreds of other people in this commercial, but you didn't notice anyone else.  It was just ridiculous how good the commercial was.  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  And then Bob Dole at the end of the commercial, and he's at home watching Britney Spears. 
[00:31:30]  God, I was sitting there watching that last night.  I go, this guy...  I mean, it was a stretch, but he was almost a president.  Right.  Now he's just making a fool of himself.  And he's doing boner jokes and stuff.  Yeah.  He does, like, Viagra boner jokes.  It's like he went from almost being president to kind of a...  People are starting to laugh at him, not with him.  Right.  How does that happen?  That's a tough fall off.  Well, look at Clinton.  He was president, and people laughing at him so...  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Joan Rivers looked like those Baku from Star Trek Insurrection.  Remember the Baku?  They had to have their skin, like, stretched back.  With those hooks.  All right, let's go to Joey.  Joey, what's up?  How you guys doing, man?  Hey.  First time call.  Listen, you know, Antla Dolly, she's such a sexy girl.  The only thing with her, I would be scared of losing the body part.  She looks like she's ready to bite someone.  I'm telling you guys, man, she plays for the wrong team.  She looks like she's always got chapped lips. 
[00:32:30]  She's definitely hot.  We got a movie poster of her.  The Tomb Raider movie that's coming out, whenever, probably in the summer, we got the movie poster.  She's unbelievable looking.  Yeah.  But I'm telling you, man, she put it over the top last night wearing a pantsuit to the Oscars.  She plays for the other team.  Thanks, Joey.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Flaming Hour from Staten Island.  Oh, we're picky, Mr. Nipple Fade?  You know what?  I don't think Jennifer Lopez is as high as everyone says either.  Oh. 
[00:33:00]  I mean, she's got an unbelievable face.  You can't take the face away from her, but the rest of the body is not that good.  Triple H said it.  Here on the show Friday.  The body's got a fat ass.  Fat ass.  There's a little, I don't know, whatever.  It's called a spade a spade.  She's fat ass.  She's out of proportion.  There's all sorts of things going on in that body.  Yeah.  Joe, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Julia Roberts, when she was laughing at all Steve Martin's jokes last night,  looked like she was just going to chomp down on Benjamin Bratt's head. 
[00:33:30]  It's like she had a piano in her mouth.  She's snaggletooth all the way.  And I'll give anyone a dollar who will go ahead and chop Benjamin Bratt's head off  just so I can hear her cry for hours because I'm sick of her.  All right.  Later, guys.  Thank you, Joe.  Big fan right there.  Big fan.  Huge.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I was watching MTV during the weekend, and they had a couple more retarded brothers on there.  Yeah?  They had Chris Farley's brother, and they had Gary Busey's brother. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, I was watching that, too.  I mean, MTV, the spring break coverage is just ridiculous.  First of all, they should sell that on DVD.  I'm watching the Acapulco undercover, those girls.  I know.  They're out of hand.  And they're just there to just show different, you know, different ways of showing them,  you know, half naked.  Yeah.  How long before just MTV, they call it just MTV Snatch?  Right.  Wouldn't that be a great show?  You'd tune in.  Definitely.  And I think Gary Busey is the retarded brother. 
[00:34:30]  Like, Gary Busey's brother's just going, hey, wait a minute.  I'm the guy.  Gary Busey's the retarded brother.  Okay?  Get it straight.  Without a doubt.  Well, let me tell you something about Chris Farley's brother.  I was watching that, too.  And I'm thinking, man, the Farley's and the Belushi's, their families are so similar.  Yeah.  And that's the time I...  You had...  Wait.  But go through it.  You had John Belushi.  You don't even have to say it.  Just an amazing, amazing comedian.  Yeah.  And then he dies much too early.  And then you have his brother, that Jim, quite frankly, is a mediocre actor and mediocre 
[00:35:00]  comedian.  But he parlayed it into something, because especially in the 80s, well, God bless him.  Jim Belushi was everywhere.  Yeah.  But, I mean, come on.  Yeah.  I'm going to listen to myself, Pools.  Same thing is happening with the Farley brother, Chris.  Yeah.  You know, an amazing comedian, you know, whatever, died young as well.  And now his brother's on the scene and just not even nearly as funny as Farley.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not pulling it off.  At all.  I think we're getting Mario Cantone on the radio. 
[00:35:30]  Supposedly, he's got some really good observations about the Oscars.  Oh, cool.  Let me go to, uh, to knock or Chris first.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  First of all, I'm not a first-time caller.  All right.  Who cares?  Anyway, my observation is on the Oscars.  Yeah.  All right.  First of all, Sarah Jessica Parker looks like that.  What was that show?  H.R. Puff and stuff?  Witchy Poo?  Witchy Poo.  Oh, I hope she's listening today. 
[00:36:00]  Remember Witchy Poo?  That's great.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  You think when he, you think when all of them brought her, it gets on top of her, like  her nose pecks him in the face like a woodpecker?  And that Del Toro dude, you know what he looks like?  Uh-huh.  You ever see the cover of the Limp Bizkit album?  Those creatures?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Those creatures.  Hey, that's not bad either.  Two good observations from you.  And I got one more.  I got the last brother.  I got the obscure Baldwin brother.  The fourth Baldwin brother?  Oh, yeah.  Right?  He pops up.  Danny, I think, right? 
[00:36:30]  Danny?  I don't even know what his name is, but he pops up.  He looks like him, but he's a horrible actor.  The Baldwin brothers, they listen to our show, so.  It's pretty, really cool.  Very talented family.  I love all the Baldwin brothers.  Yeah.  And they're all handsome young men, I must say.  Yes.  And isn't Alec, isn't Alec, or Alec, what is he?  Alec Baldwin.  Whatever.  Always pissing me off when it comes up in a crossword.  Is it the C or the X?  Alec.  Alec. 
[00:37:00]  Is he, he's banging Jennifer Love Hewitt?  Yeah.  Is that true?  What?  Yeah.  Stop the presses.  Are you kidding me?  Did anyone see that disaster of a movie this weekend?  That son of a bitch.  No, what?  That one with Jennifer Love Hewitt?  I think it was number one at the box office or close.  Yeah.  Box office, Sophie.  Box office.  I know.  It's getting horrible reviews.  Who cares?  I just want to see how hot Jennifer was in the movie and how long she was on screen with  nothing on.  We've got to go to the hotline.  One of our faves checking in.  Mario Cantone. 
[00:37:30]  Get your balls out.  You got me out of bed.  Get your balls out.  You got me out of bed.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, you got me out of bed.  Well, it's four in the afternoon.  I said I'm in bed.  I had to get up early to do The View today.  Yeah.  And then I took my Prozac.  And now I'm out of bed.  You took your Prozac after The View?  You're a brave man.  Hold on.  You know what?  Someone's telling me to be quiet.  I am on the radio.  Christ!  Someone's actually telling me to be quiet and I'm on the radio.  Get your balls out.  How was the view? 
[00:38:00]  The view was great.  Yeah?  Yeah, yes.  It was mild.  It was sweet.  Yeah, thank you.  Mario, did you get to actually sit on the couch or did you do the brick wall thing?  I did the brick wall thing.  This is my sixth time doing the Joy's Comedy Corner.  How come all the people that you want to see, the funny, entertaining people, have to do the wall?  Because I'm a nobody.  That's what?  I'm a nobody.  I can't believe that you're calling me at home. 
[00:38:30]  Well, we heard you said some funny things on The View about the Oscars.  Oh, I was.  Yeah.  And we're in the middle of our Oscar discussion.  Did you watch them?  First of all, hello, boys.  I love you guys.  And, you know, I talk about you all the time.  I get stopped in the street by more people.  I said, I heard you on O&A.  I heard you on O&A.  Right on, man.  You made me very famous.  And now I need my money and my pills.  And my daughter, Liza and Lorna, are coming with me to London.  I want my money, Sid.  Give me my money. 
[00:39:00]  Sid left.  Show my money.  I'd like to sing a song for you boys.  Called something.  Mine eyes have seen.  What is the word?  What is the word?  Can we do it again?  My money.  I want my money.  You took my money.  You know, some of the most beautiful poetry ever written can be.  I'd like to sing a song.  What song?  My money.  I want my money.  I could just do that all day.  I can't for now. 
[00:39:30]  Mario.  What?  On the red carpet thing for the Oscars with Joan.  She was saying anything last night.  Yeah.  Anything.  What about with that woman, Coco Lee, who sang the song for Crouching Tiger?  Yeah.  She was like, Coco Pops, Crouching Tiger, Steaming Dumplings.  You were fat.  Why did you learn to speak English?  She's like, I live in San Francisco my whole life.  I've always spoken English.  Mandarin?  Mandarin English?  She's Mandarin.  I had Mandarin. 
[00:40:00]  I'm surprised.  I don't even think she knows if Melissa's had her baby yet.  Melissa?  Malaga?  Malaga?  Are you pregnant, Malaga?  Malaga?  Are you still pregnant?  Malaga?  Malaga, are you pregnant?  Malaga?  Mother!  I had a boy!  It's a boy.  It's a boy.  Who's he wearing?  It's my baby.  It's my baby.  She should have gotten a golden hanger way before the birth. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, hey!  Oh, hey!  Oh, hey!  Ouch!  My daughter!  Malaga!  Malaga Beanfield was!  She was just gone.  She was out of her mind.  Oh, my God.  If I heard Gladiator juxtaposed with Ben-Hur one more time, I was going to fart on the TV.  Gladiator Ben-Hur!  You know, it's just like, it's an action and a death. 
[00:41:00]  And it was very Asian last night.  Everybody was like, ah, thank you for my husky mom.  Jim, don't go husky mom!  My husky mom!  I love my husky mom.  One guy was rallying up.  I want you to thank all y'all.  I think y'all.  I think y'all.  I think y'all.  I think y'all.  Thank you.  Yeah, the whole front row was a bunch of those crouching tiger people.  Oh, crouching tiger.  Oh, good stuff.  Hidden feces.  It was really...  You know, okay, what about the woman that took about nine hours to get up to the...  What was that about?  Her name was Jonti? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Jonti something from...  She won the Oscar for the costumes.  She took...  Know what I said at home?  I think that lady has ass cancer.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my Jesus.  Yeah, I'm going to tell you what it was.  It's called the Prozac walk.  Oh, is it?  It's like, I don't care about anybody's time but my own.  And I'll get there when I get there.  I was like, get out of the chair and walk.  That's great. 
[00:42:00]  And then the Bjork with the dead duck around her.  Let me tell you something.  And no one had the balls to say how stupid she looked.  She looked ridiculous.  I wanted to put her in a pond and watch her float.  Someone should have plucked her and made a down comforter out of her.  She was ridiculous.  And then, you know what I thought?  I thought while she was singing, I thought the neck of the duck was going to lift up off  her breath starts singing back up her.  Now, that would have been good.  Yeah, that would have been good.  Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  I think it would have been more entertaining if the Crouching Tiger people would have shown 
[00:42:30]  up in one of those big dragon outfits.  So they all could sit together.  But they're all just dressed like the big dragon.  Fire crackers going off on the red carpet.  Right?  Bunch of neon lights and steam like in any Chinatown scene in the movies.  That's so funny.  You just see their legs.  Oh, my God.  And my sister Camille called me up very upset.  Why?  Because she hates Russell Crowe.  She was like, I was like, who did you want to win?  She was like, I wanted Ed Harris to win.  She had her cigarette and her beer.  I wanted Ed Harris to win the Oscar. 
[00:43:00]  I said, but he didn't win it.  Did you see the movie?  No.  How do you know?  Because I like him.  I wanted him to win it.  Then I said, well, what's wrong with Russell Crowe?  She goes, let me tell you something about him.  There is no kidnapping threat against his life.  It's a pure publicity stunt.  Who the hell wants to kidnap the gladiator?  He's a moron.  I don't like him.  He doesn't even have a kid to kidnap.  He's an idiot.  Then she was going off about Meg Ryan.  Meg Ryan loves him because his penis is probably one and a half inches. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, she went off.  She does not like him.  You know, it sucked about this year.  We didn't have a King Gimp moment.  No, we didn't.  Last year, when King Gimp fell out of his chair, when he won.  Why didn't that make top ten greatest Oscar moments?  Oh, God, it should have been there.  Who didn't remember that?  Who cares about this?  Who was King Gimp?  Do you remember King Gimp?  It was a documentary called King Gimp about the guy in the wheelchair that painted with a brush on his head.  He fell out of his chair.  Last year, they announced the winner, King Gimp. 
[00:44:00]  They go to him in the crowd.  He starts convulsing so bad because he barely has any control of his body.  And then with that kind of excitement, he flew out of his chair like O.J.  when they pushed him down the stairs in the Naked Gun movie.  Oh, my God.  And he hit the floor, and they're trying to get him up back into his chair.  And it was like lifting up a puddle of mercury.  They could not get a hold of this guy.  Okay, how do I not remember this?  I must have been waiting.  Mario, this was the best friggin' moment of the Oscars ever. 
[00:44:30]  I just got out of rehab in Amsterdam.  I don't know anything anymore.  I can't believe I don't remember that.  Yeah, that was great.  That must have been pretty interesting.  Well, the King Gimp moment was the Prozac walk from Yancy.  Maybe that was your thing, yeah.  Jaunty Yates.  Jaunty.  She wasn't very jaunty at all.  I'm going to have to rewind and watch that.  Oh, you timed it.  About 30 seconds.  It took her out.  Oh, God.  It was ridiculous.  I was like, go!  Go.  And then they go to a clip of Gladiator, and you think she'd be at the podium when they cut back?  No, she's only on the first step.  She's still walking. 
[00:45:00]  Russell Crowe should have taken her head off with two swords.  He really made the crowd happy in the movie.  He's cocky, though.  He's tough.  He scares me.  He didn't even break his smile.  He's very cocky.  Steve Martin was brilliant.  He was all right.  He was okay.  I just, he was so, I loved him.  I mean, some of the jokes are pretty good.  Oh, his jokes.  I just, he's one of my favorites.  He got a little edgy, which I appreciated.  Oh, I loved that he did.  Yeah.  Brilliant.  All right.  He was great.  Julia Roberts, glad she won.  Ed Harris should have won.  And, you know, I'm sorry, Gladiator.  Did you guys like Gladiator? 
[00:45:30]  I mean, I liked it.  I thought it was great.  Yeah.  I know you guys like it.  The guy movie of the year.  Action Pack.  Yeah, Action Pack, yeah.  It's a guy's movie.  Mario, a lot of guys.  I know you guys love Russell Crowe.  I like it, too.  But I like traffic better.  Really?  Yeah.  Did you like Russell Crowe's hairdo?  He looked like Michael Landon on Bonanza.  That's awesome.  He had a test set.  Wow.  Damn it.  You nailed it.  We were trying to figure out how he looked like.  He had like a Ponderosa tuxedo one.  That's right.  What was the best we came up with? 
[00:46:00]  He had the Kenickie from Grease hairdo.  Oh, he did have that.  Okay, what about Bob Dylan?  Oof.  He looked like Captain Hook in a bus and truck of Peter Pan.  Vincent Price-ish?  Yeah, that, too.  But he would look like, I thought he was kind of like, oh, yeah.  We said he looked like a 20-year-old lab rat.  Like, yeah, the lab rat that got the shot of something and outlived it.  The secret of Nim.  Yeah.  He did.  He looked at you, but he speaks so clearly. 
[00:46:30]  And then it's like, yeah, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,  I love it.  Every time there was a word that was there, I was like, oh, he said something.  I said a lyric.  It's impossible to understand.  It's impossible.  And they all love him.  And I think he's brilliant when you read them.  He's an institution.  He is.  But you've got to read his lyrics.  You need closed caption.  You need something.  You don't know what he said.  York was that.  Bjorn had just a song that was just one run-on sentence.  Mm-hmm.  Bjorky, dorky.  Bjorky, dorky.  All right, Mario.  All right, my boys.  Mario, thank you for asking. 
[00:47:00]  I have to go work out and keep his body in shape.  There's a lot of pressure on me, boys.  Mario, could you leave us with a little Carmen?  Because we were just watching the Civil War episode.  Hey, are you guys?  I am General Captain A.  Dear you guys.  I hate you guys.  I hate you guys very much.  I love that.  That's one of my favorite ones.  The Confederate.  The Confederate.  The Confederate.  The Confederate.  I am fighting for the glorious head.  And today, we are going to kick your ass.  The Confederate.  That's his little general companion. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  The Confederate.  The Confederate.  All right, you guys.  I love you.  I'll see you very soon.  Thank you, Mario.  Goodbye.  Come see us.  All right.  I will.  Bye-bye.  There he goes.  Mario Cantone.  Hilarious.  With a heavy heart, I must inform you.  All right.  The death of your son, Kenny.  That is the best of us.  Confederate.  I really hate you.  So much.  All right.  All right. 
[00:48:00]  I think we figured out the voting for the Best Ass Contest.  Did we?  Seemed like there was a slight snag when we first announced it.  Yeah.  Actually, I think they've got a poll up on WNEW.com now.  I'm still trying to vote on Foundry.  Well, Foundry.  It's a mission, and I'm going to try.  Wait.  He said he's having a problem.  All right.  Wait.  Do me a favor.  Go to Double Do.  I'm up to the point where I put in my blood type.  Well, hold on.  I'm getting there.  I'm getting there.  Don't you have one of those things already?  Don't you have a username?  I'm going through the process like anyone else would go through the process. 
[00:48:30]  You know, and I've got to tell you something.  This is like trying to get a credit application from Ford or something.  Good.  Keeps out the idiots as far as I'm concerned.  But that's our whole audience, babe.  That's true.  We need the idiots.  We love the idiots.  Right.  Actually, you know something we're having a major...  The idiots make this show possible.  There's a serious glitch going on.  So Scott's putting on a poll for today on WNEW because he's worried that it might not handle the traffic.  So we're going to fix everything tonight and get it working fine. 
[00:49:00]  But people can still vote, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Best Ass Contest.  We're down to 10 finalists.  Their pictures are up on WNEW.com.  Very, very, very, very nice pictures for you to check out.  Yeah, the finalists up there.  Pick your favorite ass.  And you can vote at WNEW.com.  It's very easy if you go to WNEW.com.  Of course, we have a trip to Las Vegas courtesy of Gear Magazine.  And we also want to thank the Pinnacle Horned Goat Wheat for sponsoring the Best Ass Contest.  It's like you almost thanked penis. 
[00:49:30]  Thank Pinnacle Horned Goat Wheat.  All right.  Dr. Bob's here.  Dr. Bob.  All right.  Dr. Bob's here.  More of your phone calls.  We haven't really talked about Sopranos yet.  Yeah.  Oh, and a big F you to the fan.  What's the matter?  Do we need to ask a talk?  No, it's not even Mike and the Mad Dog that are on now.  This is a pet.  It just amazed me today. 
[00:50:00]  I mean, you're not really going to care.  But Tiger Woods and, you know, the PGA thing, you know, there was a rain delay so they couldn't get the whole round in.  So they had to play the last nine holes this morning on NBC, I guess.  All right.  Started at 10.  I had to catch a train.  So I'm like, all right, I'll throw the fan a bone and I'll take my Walkman.  I'll be on the train and they'll give me Tiger updates.  Right.  For an hour train ride, not one Tiger update.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Station blows.  I'm really pissed. 
[00:50:30]  You're the fan.  You're the sports station.  There's Tiger's in the hunt to win something and then you didn't even update it once in my hour commute.  Chuck O'Briquet.  You're the show.  Come on.  Tony Soprano.  Come on.  He's a great golfer.  Instead, I have to listen to them interview Jeff Ruland of Iona.  Oh, my.  Maybe for two minutes it's interesting, but for 40.  And then John Calipari, who has been a failure as a basketball coach the last few years. 
[00:51:00]  Now he's coaching in the NITs.  NIT, it's the second bracket of college basketball.  No one cares.  It's the retarded golfer.  Wow.  That's sad.  And they had him on for a half hour.  I'm like, just tell me if Tiger's leading this tournament so I can listen to some music.  Scott Muni's ready to start his hour program.  I can't miss it.  You can't miss that hour.  It's the first time in a while I turned on the family. 
[00:51:30]  I have a reason to turn them on.  And they didn't give me what I wanted.  A stupid update with the PGA.  I'm big dick black.  You don't want to hire any niggas, that's all.  It turned out that Tiger Woods won.  Charcoal briquette.  Easy.  212-757-1027.  Your gay oral station.  1027.  Paulie Anthony.  Anthony, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company. 
[00:52:00]  Yes.  You need a different creative gift for someone's birthday, new baby, or to wish someone well.  Skip over that.  Just call 1-800-829-BEAR.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Back the F up, man.  You want me to read it verbatim?  Yes.  This place effing blows.  Vermont Teddy Bear.  Mark's copy.  Lisa Orban is the, um...  Lisa Orban is our writer.  Need a different and creative gift for someone's birthday, new baby, or to wish someone well?  Or to celebrate St. Paddy's Day?  Give it a personal touch and surprise them with a Bear Graham gift from the Vermont Teddy Bear Company. 
[00:52:30]  Call 1-800-829-BEAR.  You talk to a friendly bear counselor.  They help you choose from over 100 handcrafted bears for any occasion, personalized just for them,  and delivered in a colorful gift box with a card and delicious chocolate.

They have bears for hobbies and occupations, too, like the nurse bear and the teacher bear.  And for St. Patrick's Day, ask about the kiss me, I'm Irish bear,  with a shamrock-shaped kiss me tattoo on his arm. 
[00:53:00]  You know, yeah, what's the problem?  I'm trying to breathe, because people hate when we bitch, and then, see, we can't, oh, God.  But we jumped in a time machine, and now it is right before St. Paddy's Day.  I know people hate when we bitch, but this place just effing blows.  We've been here for three years, no one cares, no one wants to win here at WNAW.  We can't even do the basics.  Here's a sponsor paying good money, and no one even bothers to see if they write copies, 
[00:53:30]  you know, in the book.  They're paying like $3,000 for this live read.  Dude, the basics.  No one cares.  No one cares.  No one cares.  It's been three years.  No one effing cares around here.  Send your email and say, I'm a little baby, but you know what?  Ant and I came to New York.  We want to win.  We want to be on a successful station.  This place effing blows.  Yes, N-E-W sucks monkey ass.  No one's here.  5.30 comes around.  The only people that are still in the building are Ant and I and everyone associated with the show. 
[00:54:00]  Management takes long weekend.  No one cares.  The trend came out last week.  It blew.  Looks like we're going to have another bad ratings book.  And you know what?  Everyone's going to walk around all surprised.  Wow.  You know, we're doing so much, and we still suck, and the station's in the toilet.  Because we can't even do the basics.  God.  Management goes to Washington when they should be spending their time here.  If you were in a hospital and you were like the doctor, let's say our management staff is like a doctor. 
[00:54:30]  They are visiting the room with the person with a hangnail.  Meanwhile, somebody's in the other room, the N-E-W, the N-E-W patient, with his chest laid open and his heart stopped.  But they'll get to them eventually.  We've got to tend to the stubbed toe over here in Washington.  You know, and I'm sick of faking it.  The ratings come in and, you know, thank God, knock on wood, you know, the show continues to do okay. 
[00:55:00]  It won't if the station continues to just be a cluster out.  Then you've got to act in front of management like, wow, can't really understand why the rest of the station's falling apart.  You know, I know you guys have put so much effort and time into making this place better.  I ain't making it anymore.  The place blows.  The doors.  So they go, hey, we've got a great idea to make the station better.  I'm like, oh, really?  What, are you finally going to buy a new van?  Maybe hire a marketing director that has a clue?  Oh, my God.  Oh, is it this one? 
[00:55:30]  Is it what we saw in the office?  What?  Is that what you're going to bring up?  Well, it's almost embarrassing to bring it up, but the thing that hits you in the head when I open it up and threw it?  This is hysterical.  There's a little pouch.  Like, it looks like a little case, a little bag.  And Opie goes, what the F is this?  Pulls out this thing, which then flies open to the size of a car windshield.  And it says, wow, on it.  The lucrative wow emblem is on this. 
[00:56:00]  It's one of those things that you put in your car window to keep your car from getting hot inside.  Right.  On your windshield.  That is what, you know what?  For the people that still use them, great.  Whatever.  But it's something that was popular in 1988.  Hey, shut up.  It keeps Maria's ass from getting burned when she sits on the F&A rock, okay?  I rock.  All right?  You got it?  I always put my mother effing windshield heat deflector in the I rock. 
[00:56:30]  He throws the patch on my desk.  We open it up and the whole thing goes, yeah.  Takes out Ant, takes out Ben.  Yeah, flies open.  And it's like, what?  Here's something.  Ant and I invented wow, okay?  It's time to invent something else.  We don't want wow mugs and wow keychains and wow sun visors to keep your vinyl seats cool in the summer.  We don't want any of that crap.  Mark it something else that someone would be interested in. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  We have a billboard, though, in the middle of Times Square.  What was that about?  I heard about this, but I haven't seen it.  They finally decided to advertise for the show.  Yeah.  And sorry, got a picture again.  Wait, let me just get this guy off the...  Marisol.  Marisol.  Marisol.  They need to market your asses right out the studio.  What?  Whose?  Youth.  They need to what?  Market your asses right out.  Who?  They don't need you guys no more.  You and Opie.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:57:30]  Why don't they need us anymore?  All you do is cry.  You cry, you cry.  That's all we do?  That's all you do.  We just gave you an hour and 15 minutes of really good radio.  Now we're bitching about something that happened.  You think you did?  You're listening?  You're listening, you freaking quat.  Are you that stupid that you continue to listen to a show that sucks?  You stupid quat.  You guys do.  You suck so bad.  Then turn off the radio, you wetback.  Then don't listen.  Then don't listen.  You lose the wetback. 
[00:58:00]  Don't listen then.  Why do you listen?  Can I ask you why?  I think you're me not to listen to.  I'm trying to boost your ratings.  You're making such not-nosed fantasy.  You're making a tool of yourself.  Yeah.  Because see, unless I'm waiting for a Tiger Woods update, when I listen to a radio show  that sucks, I turn it off and go somewhere else.  Turn it off.  All right?  Marisol.  Anything else you quat?  I'm going to take...  So they finally decide, hey, you know, we need a mark in the station. 
[00:58:30]  You know?  Screw a new van, which we desperately need or whatever.  Maybe a TV commercial.  I don't even care about that stuff.  Seriously?  Yeah.  But we discovered, because Psycho Mark was high as a kite, it's fair to say, walking  through Times Square, and he thought he saw something, so when he sobered up, he called  Ben to confirm it, and I guess there's like a huge billboard in Times Square that has the  lineup of WNEW on it. 
[00:59:00]  What?  Is it one of those that change?  Like, was it just like a light or something?  Do you know, Ben?  I don't.  Earl talked to him.  Find out about him.  Get Earl.  Where's Earl?  Earl, what do you want on this billboard?  Get Earl.  Earl, I want to hear about this billboard.  Now, it just shows you how stupid this place is, and I'll tell you why.  You might think, wow, it's kind of cool to have your names in the middle of Times Square  on one of those big billboards.  Yeah.  The people in general that walk around Times Square don't live here. 
[00:59:30]  So you're promoting a station to people that live in the middle of the Midwest.  It's fine to put big Calvin Klein things on, because they're available all over.  The average New Yorker avoids Times Square like it has mad cow disease.  Oh, this just then, sorry to announce this, Marisol, who just was on the phone, just threw a fetus  out the window and the rod he ate it.  Oh, sorry to have to bring that up. 
[01:00:00]  We're back.  Yeah, you're preaching to tourists.  Tourists.  Earl.  Earl.  How you doing?  How are you?  Earl.  Have you seen the billboard?  Yes, I have.  And?  If you say it's cool, I'm going to punch you.  No, I was just surprised that it was there.  Earl, you've worked for NW for, what, 18 years now?  12.  I've been here for 12 years. 
[01:00:30]  12.  Seems like 18.  I want to, have you been listening for the last 20 minutes?  Yeah.  Oh, see, all right.  Tell everyone why that billboard is the stupidest idea ever.  I mean, it's in the middle of Times Square.  It's a lot of tourists there.  Hey, there you go.  It's people who generally won't.  New Yorkers avoid Times Square.  Yes.  If you want to market WNW, you put billboards up in Jersey.  Maybe I put them on the roads. 
[01:01:00]  Maybe I'm right out the tunnels.  Maybe I'm Long Island.  You know, hire a homeless guy to hold up a WNW outside the tunnels every day.  Earl.  That would be more effective than something in Times Square.  Swear to God.  It took Earl five years to hang that billboard.  Anthony from West Orange.  Very good.  Took him so long that the lineup's wrong. 
[01:01:30]  Anyway.  And then, like, I see salespeople outside the studios were ranting and raving, and they're  all laughing.  They think this is, like, funny.  Oh, those guys.  It's a joke.  It's a joke.  It's a little joke, isn't it?  Are you kidding?  Billboard in Times Square ain't going to do it.  Anyway, Anthony, so we're talking about the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  They want us to talk about bears for St. Patrick's Day.  Yes.  Ask about the Kiss Me, I'm Irish bear with a shamrock-shaped Kiss Me tattoo on the arm.

[01:02:30]  St. Patrick's Day.  Okay, terrific.  The Rack is back.  Catch the Radio Chick, 9 to noon, 1027 WNEW.  Uh, Joe, what's up?  Hey, yeah, I was in Times Square yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah, I looked up and I saw your guy's promotion billboard.  Oh, you saw the billboard in the middle of Times Square, huh?  Yeah, it was on for like four seconds.  What is it?  What, it's just, it's not even up there all the time, just kind of flashes to it?  Oh, yeah.  It just says like WNEW, then it says WOW, Open Anthony, Ron and Fez, and it just goes 
[01:03:00]  away.  Oh, man.  It sucks.  This place should just go away.  It just goes, so it's not even a permanent billboard.  So if somebody in New York that lives here happens to see a flash.  Yeah.  Then, it's like seeing a UFO.  People don't go to Times Square to live here.  And, oh, exactly, exactly.  All right, Joe.  The people that look up, it's like they're just porous and they don't even know what the 
[01:03:30]  hell it is.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye, guys.  The tool bought it, right?  This is classic.  The tool bought it, right?  This is classic.  Holy yes.  And then he'll make believe, you know, he knew we were messing with him.  What a tool.  Thanks, Pete.  Well, the WNW newsletters out.  I swear to God, this could be the day.  This could be the day I have a nervous breakdown.  This could be it right here. 
[01:04:00]  Been waiting for this day for a long time.  What?  Are you kidding?  Holy Jesus Christ.  This is how, there are so many inept people that surround us.  It's not even funny.  Go ahead, Ant.  Go ahead.  What?  Go ahead.  Read.  Yeah, explain to everybody. 
[01:04:30]  I have a little Vanderbilt Roadshow recap that was written.  Mm-hmm.  And this is on the WNW newsletter.  He writes, you really shouldn't have time to be putting together a newsletter.  You should be busy doing other things.  The Kiss Dwarfs tribute band had the crowd in hysterics  and was just about the funniest thing I have ever seen.  That means it sucked.  A talented bunch of vertically challenged folks. 
[01:05:00]  The band did sound remarkably like Kiss.  Now, what's wrong with that, Opie?  The guy's complimenting the Kiss Dwarfs for sounding remarkably like Kiss.  Very talented.  Well, Anthony, it was obvious to the 1,563 people there that saw the Kiss Dwarfs  that not only were they lip-syncing to a record,  they were playing cardboard guitars. 
[01:05:30]  I think the lead guitarist could afford real wood, so his was made out of wood.  The rest of them had cardboard instruments.  So, you're saying the reason they sounded remarkably like Kiss is because it was a Kiss CD?  Yes.  In a CD player?  Yes.  How are we doing tonight?  Yeah, Dwarf could get his voice that hot.  Well, yes, it can.  I'm a boss!  All right. 
[01:06:00]  And then the clincher.  This is, yeah, on the WNEW newsletter.  It lets everybody on staff know a little bit about what's going to be going on in the coming days  and on the various shows here at the WNEW, Mecca for entertainment.  Opie and Anthony have a jam-packed week ahead.  And then he proceeds to tell us who's going to be on the show.  And I guess he got the information where?  From Ben. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, did Ben give them the upcoming guest list?  Well, Ben, get on mic, because this is the funny, this makes this thing pretty funny.  Because they got, you know, they have all the other shows.  And what they're going to be doing and who's going to be on the show.  What's Ron and Fez doing?  Ron and Fez, Fez takes his fear of flying Friday.  Okay, all those with fears like they'd like to conquer should drop in on the guys.  The doctor, that's Dr. Holtz, is in.  I have no clue what that means. 
[01:07:00]  Hold on, hold on.  I almost had a hemorrhage.  On Ron and Fez, Fez takes on his fear of flying Friday.  All those with fears they'd like to conquer should drop in on the guys.  And the doctor, that's Dr. Holtz, is in.  Okay, I guess they're having Dr. Holtz on, who deals with phobias.  All right.  Very good.  And then Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony have a jam-packed week ahead. 
[01:07:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Because I know this will work.  So he comes in, right?  I get an email.  All right, go ahead.  I get an email about what's going on this week.  So we kind of just joke around in the office.  We're like, gee, let's say we've got Russell Crowe, Derek Jeter, and Otto and George.  So it kind of looks real.  Some of you reckon...  He asked you, you know, what you guys got going on in the show.  So I can put it in my newsletter, right?  Okay.  So you guys say that, and he writes,  Opie and Anthony have a jam-packed week ahead.  Derek Jeter checks in with the guys on Tuesday. 
[01:08:00]  Otto and George will be in-house on Wednesday.  And the newly crowned best actor, Russell Crowe, calls in on Thursday.  Okay.  No, no, no.  Good week.  That's quite some good bookings, huh?  Oh, my God.  That's better bookings than Letterman.  Not bad.  We had a hard enough time getting Cheryl Crowe in here.  Right. 
[01:08:30]  Russell Crowe is going to pop in.  And we didn't even want Cheryl Crowe, but we're like,  hell, she's more famous than most people we have on the show.  What the hell?  We'll give it a shot.  Oh.  Russell Crowe.  Did he blink when you said that?  No.  He was like, thanks.  Great week.  Wouldn't you just go, wow.  That is an effing coup.  How did you do that?  Russell Crowe, today, the most famous person in the world. 
[01:09:00]  In the world.  In the world.  We decided this.  We looked on the cover of the post of Russell Crowe,  and then we looked on the cover of Sports Illustrated.  You're supposed to illustrate it because Gene is on the cover.  Oh, my God.  Russell Crowe.  That's great.  Christ the Lord on Friday, by the way.  Christ the Lord.  Karen, what's going on?  Hey, yeah, as long as you're digging on the sales department,  forget about the St. Patrick's Day thing.  They just played a commercial for the TV musical of South Pacific that's on TV tonight. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Is anybody who's watching or listening to your radio show going to watch that tonight?  You're going to ruin it.  Shit.  Christ the Lord.  They'll take money from anyone.  That's okay.  You know, fine.  We'll advertise anything.  Is it demographics or...  I think the demographics are perfect, yeah.  Yeah, I'm lucky.  Our audience will be tuning in in droves to South Pacific.  Mario Pantone.  Can't wait to hear that.  Show tune.  I'm going to wash that man right out of here. 
[01:10:00]  Is that from South Pacific?  I don't even know.  I'm taking the stab, is it?  Yeah.  All right.  How about that?  I think you know.  I think you know.  Yeah, I'll be watching.  I'll be in show.  Will Russell Crowe have a phone argument with Dice?  Tuddle wondering?  Well, you've got to stay tuned.  Thank you, Karen.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  This is a dream, right? 
[01:10:30]  We're going to wake up soon?  I know we're going to wake up, and Scott Muni's going to be in here going,  Hey, boys.  I've been here the whole time.  You were in my dream, and you, and you, and you?  I know, kid.  Thank God when Russell Crowe shows up, we have Anna Kornikova for Teen Week, so that'll keep  him entertained.  Russell Crowe checking in.  See you blokes on Friday.

Passed a radio station today.  They had seven vehicles.  This is a crappy FM station in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  They had a Humvee, a couple of pickups, a couple of vans, a car. 
[01:14:00]  It was unbelievable how many cars in all I could think of.  And you guys can't get a van that runs?  Well, I think the van is finally running again.  They put a new battery in it, I think.  So it should be okay for a little bit until another part falls off it.  Frank, I mean, because we have a lot of newer listeners.  Right.  And people hate when we bitch, but it's part of the reality of this place.  Right.  And we can't ignore it.  We were doing a WOW sticker stop last summer, okay?  WOW's coming back in a couple of weeks. 
[01:14:30]  Who cares?  No, I mean, we care.  But, I mean, God.  Anyway.  No listeners care.  We care.  All right, Frank, listen to this.  So we're coming back from a sticker stop from Long Island, a WOW sticker stop,  to get the brand-new WOW designs bumper stickers, okay?  Right.  Pete, who's been here, how long has he been, Pete, 30 years?  Plus 30.  Pete, the engineer, he's been here for 30-plus years.  Yeah.  Okay, he's going to retire in the next few years probably, all right? 
[01:15:00]  All right.  He's coming back in the WOW van, and the wheel falls off the van.  I remember that.  Falls off the van.  Yeah.  And crashes into a car, right?  I mean, the wheel or whatever, Pete was kind of okay.  Just really startled.  The whole wheel came off.  That's good.  Startle the guy that's, I don't know, pushing 60.  I'm losing you guys.  I got to go.  All right.  Bye, Frank.  Thank God Pete's still alive or else we wouldn't have gotten our little mic holder stand things 
[01:15:30]  here lubricated.  Are you feeling it?  Are you feeling it?  Look at this.  I can whip this thing.  Hey.  Hey.  Can we take this?  It spins around in circles.  Can we take this off?  There's no media coming in to...  You're going to have to unscrew that nut.  Can we get some pliers?  They've got these big, huge, stupid WNW mic flags and all the microphones just in case.  Just in case the TV crews need to come in and interview someone from this place. 
[01:16:00]  Right.  So as we patiently wait for that moment to happen...  Snap it off.  See what this sounds like.  I need a hammer.  Here's the pliers.  There.  He's got pliers.  What?  Oh.  No, no, no.  I'll grip it from underneath and just snap it.  There's no TV crews coming in.  So I'd rather be able to see Anthony.  Here we go. 
[01:16:30]  Just a thing.  Uh-oh.  Did you strip it?  I thought Pete was here.  Did you strip it?  Yeah, I did, actually.  That's going to snap off and you're not going to have a mic.  Did it snap?  I haven't broken anything in a while.  I bet the bottom of that wingnut snaps right off.  I don't care.  I know.  Whoa.  Is that turning?  What did he put that on with?  Mine always just falls off.  All right. 
[01:17:00]  Got to go to plan B.  Uh-oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Let me get over here.  That ain't coming off.  Where are the snips?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No.  You will never get that off.  Try from...  Oh, there you go.  You're breaking it.  Pry it with the pliers.  Pry it down.  Oh, Pete.  Oh, his.  Oh, his. 
[01:17:30]  What?  Pete is his.  He's not that screaming.  He's yelling the F word.  Oh, no.  Pete.  I don't care.  You got to say, I'm like, you're thinking about your big heavy wrench.  Get that wrench.  All right.  Ah, nice.  I need to see Anthony.  I said it, like, a month ago.  All right.  Oh, God.  I want to pay my ass.  Now, get in there with the pliers and just rip it.  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, God.  Uh-oh.  What?  My mic went off.  No, it's still working.  Is it?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I think it put the pliers down on it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no.  Jesse brought in the big sledgehammer.  Dude, just rip it.  Brr, brr, brr.  That's some pliable plastic.  There you go.  Once you get through that, you're in.  Now you're in. 
[01:18:30]  There goes a piece of it.  Got a scissor?  Yeah, I just need to get through this part.  Something to cut.  We need snips.  It's true.  You still got that ring on there.  Wow, you have destroyed that.  There it is.  But now you got the...  Ah, scissors.  I don't think these are going to work.  Yeah, it will.  Hr, hr, hr.  Oh. 
[01:19:00]  You can't get those off now.  Damn it.  What if the media comes in now and sees two square things on there with no call letters?  It's going to be trouble.  I'll tell you that much.  Anyway.  So you're just going to leave it?  Yeah.  Looks like a shark attacked it.  Look at this thing.  Look at this thing.  My God.  You know who really, really needs a vacation? 
[01:19:30]  Us.  I would say you more than me right now.  I just get frustrated because this place sucks.  It sucks.  And I just keep waiting for it to get better.  It's not getting better.  And it won't.  Then we'll get another bad ratings book and everyone will be confused.  Man, we're trying so hard.  I don't get it.  I don't know what it is.  Steve is very pissed.  Why?  What did he say?  What's he saying out there? 
[01:20:00]  I went to put the tools back and he starts screaming, don't take any effing tools.  Tell them to go eff themselves.  Uh-oh.  He's not the kind of guy that just curses right there.  That's what we all love each other.  Josh in South Jersey on Instant Feedback, he just writes, you're on the radio.  Oh.  That's very funny, Josh.  All right.  Sorry.  I got one of them off.  I just need to.  I know.  We're done.  Did you cut yourself? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, see?  See, right over there.  You always do that.  Well, I feel better, though.  You know.  Alan, what's going on?  Hey.  I just thought I wanted to give any truth to the rumor.  I saw in the jumbotron there that Russell's bringing Meg with him on Friday.  Yeah, they're going to reconcile on our show.  Hey, listen.  I don't want to see those call letters spilling out next to that little Kittner boy either,  okay?  That's what it looks like right now.  All right, Alan.  Take care, buddy.  Bye.  Bye.  I thought we were in commercial.  I wonder why Pete's mad, though, that you ruined the N.E.W. square thing. 
[01:21:00]  Wait.  We have five microphones in the studio, and three out of the five still have the fine N.E.W.  huge, you know, mic flags on them.  See, if we don't have eye contact, we step on each other.  I told Pete a while ago that I can't see Anthony because these mic flags are so big.  Because being across from each other like this, we have to have eye contact, or we step on  each other.  Right.  And this big block that says N.E.W. on it is right at eye level when you pull the mic down. 
[01:21:30]  You can't.  It's like watching a chimp try to work through a puzzle.  Oh, man.  Now it's up there.  Listen.  So, that's it.  It's not coming off.  See, how do I get it off this thing?  Shoot it.  Shoot through it?  All right.  Let's get back to the show.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, O&A.  Listen.  I've been listening to you guys for a while, right?  Yeah.  I'm pissed off at everybody that works there except for you two guys.  First of all, you can send a girl to Jamaica because she got a hot ass, but you can't get 
[01:22:00]  a new car.  You can't sit up there and get better advertising.  You can't get a new van.  I mean...  Man, the first thing you said was almost wrong.  Listen.  With the Jamaica trips, but we were able to work that out.  And then on top, I've seen people on welfare who got better budgets than you do.  Right.  What's wrong with that, man?  I think I should come up there and teach the guys how to spend some money.  Where my shit?  Where my shit?  All right, Dave.  What'd I say?  What'd I say?  What'd I tell you? 
[01:22:30]  Jose, what's going on?  Howdy, Caggots.  Hey.  Hey, I'm just saying if you guys still have that job opening from 3 to 7, because no one's  on the radio right now from 3 to 7, so is there a job opening?  Well, maybe.  Yeah?  Let's, uh...  I don't know.  We'll see what happens.  All right.  Wait and see.  Okay, tools.  Go see you later.  All right, Jose.  Bye-bye.  All right? 
[01:23:00]  Okay.  All right.  Hey, Anthony, the Sopranos rocked last night.  Yes.  Giving some pointers.  Might have to start using some of the tactics around here.  Could someone just give me a knife?  How about a putting iron?  You need a putter?  No, just give me a knife, because as soon as I get this off, then I'll be happy.  You'll hurt yourself with a knife.  You will definitely cut yourself with a knife. 
[01:23:30]  Just keep bending it back and forth and back and forth until it cracks.  What happened?  Pete's really mad.  Why is he mad?  Is he mad at the plastic?  He's mad at Opie destroying things.  No, there's still three mic flags.  Yeah.  I told him and everyone else that would listen to us that I can't see it because of this huge mic flag.  Can't we just break out the FM talk at 1027 ones? 
[01:24:00]  Those were even bigger.  None of those things?  Those were as big as our heads.  We'd have to peek from behind it to talk to each other.  Hey, Ed, you there?  They were giant.  They were huge.  Let me go to Ed.  Ed, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  How you doing?  I'm thinking you guys are sounding pretty pissed off.  Maybe you guys should start just wrecking the whole studio.  That's coming.  That might happen.  I told you guys an hour ago that this, I think, could be the day I have a nervous breakdown.  Stick around.  Yeah, get the sled camera back in there. 
[01:24:30]  Get the plug.  Just start swinging.  I just want to hear things breaking, you know?  I got three years of frustration that's going to come out very, very soon, whether it's today or in the very near future.  Do it up.  All right, Ed.  Take it easy.  Bye.  My God.  I got it off, Ed.  You did.  Uh-oh, this part's going to be, needs to be replaced.  What's that?  What did you do?  Uh-oh.  Yes, he.  Those are very delicate pieces of, uh, instrumentation. 
[01:25:00]  So, Anthony, uh, The Sopranos?  Yeah.  Yeah, great, uh, episode last night.  The violence is back.  All the fun and excitement of The Sopranos.  Pauly's character rocked.  Pauly from Rocky.  I just know him as Pauly.  Yeah.  Even when he was in Back to School with, uh, Rodney Dangerfield, it was like, ah, look, it's Pauly.  He was Old Man Bacalant.  Yeah, see what?  Hey, that's good.  With, uh, the lung cancer, coughing and hacking up blood.  Burt Young is his name.  Right.  And, um, they put him on a job last night. 
[01:25:30]  He had to kill this guy.  There's a lunatic.  A Mustang Sally, his name is.  Who caved some, uh, guy's head in with a putter.  That was a great scene.  It's just, and it's something that you just, you've seen a thousand times right up until the putter goes over his head.  Like this Mustang Sally guy is in his Mustang with his chick and they're having an argument.  Chick gets out of the car.  Walks up to this, uh, one of the guys that are kind of, uh, known, well, I think his son is somebody that's on, uh, one of Tony's crews. 
[01:26:00]  And, uh, the girl says, could you give me a ride?  She wants to get away from, uh, her boyfriend, this Mustang Sally lunatic.  And the guy's like, all right, well, maybe you should just go back in the car with your boyfriend.  The boyfriend's like, what the F are you doing talking to her guy?  You know, all of a sudden he's involved in their argument.  So he's just telling the chick, you know, why don't you get back in the car?  You know, I can't go over.  I can't be driving you anywhere.  Mustang Sally just comes out with a golf club and smashes the kid over the head until he's just a bloody mess in the street. 
[01:26:30]  Great scene.  Really good.  I mean, they don't, they don't cut corners on the violence.  No, not at all.  Well, and then he turns out to be obviously one of the sons of a guy that's on Tony's crew.  So now they got to take care of Mustang Sally, who is in hiding.  Who's, who is the, uh, the grandson of, uh, Paulie, right?  Or the godson of Paulie?  Yeah.  He's a godson.  Of Paulie.  Yeah.  Of Burt Young's character there.  So, uh, they figure that's the guy that can get closest to Mustang Sally. 
[01:27:00]  Because he's, you know, he knows him.  He's related.  And they send him over to the house.  My God.  He's supposed to pop him in the head.  Kind of skims his head.  He's got to shoot the guy in the house that's with him.  And then, uh, the old guy, Burt Young and Mustang Sally go, fighting with the gun.  Mustang Sally going for his own gun.  Trying.  I don't know how that guy with lung cancer fought off Mustang Sally.  Maybe because he had a bullet skimmed to his head.  Yeah, he was already hurting.  But when that gun went off and his head, Mustang Sally's head blew up. 
[01:27:30]  You see the ceiling?  The chunks on the ceiling.  It was chunks and blood.  It was one of the best headshot scenes ever.  Ever.  On TV.  One of the most graphic.  Joey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What about how funny it was when he was driving home, drops the inhaler, boom, smacks himself,  kills himself right there.  Yeah.  And what song was on the radio?  Because that was hilarious.  Oh, I can't remember.  That was just too funny.  You knew he was going to get caught.  He was driving around, whistling, blood everywhere. 
[01:28:00]  Everywhere, all of a sudden, smacks.  Hey, he was happy, though.  Hey.  He had a good time.  He lit up a cigarette.  He started smoking.  He's choking a butt like you wouldn't believe.  And then all of a sudden, smashed.  He can't get the inhaler.  That's it.  It's over, Johnny.  Punch out.  That was a bummer.  I was hoping he was going to stay around for a couple weeks.  One more episode, at least.  That's what they need.  Yeah, I knew he was just going to be short-term or whatever.  But I thought we'd get two or three episodes.  What do you think about Uncle Junior?  Do you think he's playing the cancer out, or do you think it's true?  No, I think he's got it. 
[01:28:30]  What about, no, look how happy he was until Baklava walked in the room.  All of a sudden, he was happy, and then he walked in.  He's like, I got the cancer.  Right.  No, I don't.  We'll have to wait and see.  They're going to take him out.  I'm telling you, the April crew, they're going to take Tony out.  That's what's going down.  Later, faggots.  I don't think they could take Tony out.  I think the show would be over.  Well, they'll take Tony out in the last episode.  They could try.  But how about the whole Christopher's girlfriend and Arthur, the guy at the restaurant? 
[01:29:00]  That whole thing?  Oh, my God.  And you're just sitting there going, oh, don't do this.  Christopher's girlfriend, Christopher, just made a maid man.  And he's got his fiancée now, this hot blonde chick.  She's been the hostess at the restaurant.  So, Artie over there is in love with her.  Gets all drunk and starts giving Christopher crap about his chick.  And you just sit watching this and go, no, shut up.  Shut up. 
[01:29:30]  And it was kind of weird because it was almost like watching Joe Pesci hassling Spider in Goodfellas.  And, of course, Christopher was Spider in that movie.  Because he's looking at it and you're looking at Christopher as if he's Pesci.  Like, oh, you better shut up.  Don't hassle this guy too much.  He picks up a fork.  He gets ready to gouge his eye out and Tony stops it.  Because the guy's talking about his chick and it got a little ugly.  The best is when he told Tony, I love her, Tony.  I love her. 
[01:30:00]  And then he says, I'll be in love with her, Tony.  Tony starts laughing.  Don't tell anybody else.  Don't ever repeat that again.  So, obviously, that's going to be a problem.  And then he's going through his midlife crisis.  He's got an earring.  He's got an earring.  Vinny.  Yo.  Hey, Vinny.  How you doing, buddy?  All right.  That song you were talking about with Paulie before he died?  Yeah.  That was the song, Hold On Loosely.  Hold On Loosely, what, 38th special, was it?  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no.  Yeah, because, swear to God, I taped it.  I was watching the game with my fiancee. 
[01:30:30]  It was Sister Golden Hair.  Yeah.  It was Sister Golden Hair.  It was Sister Golden Hair.  That's what it was.  Dick.  I'm sorry.  That's all right, Vinny.  That's all right.  That's all right.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  What's going on, man?  Hey.  There were some really good effects on that.  On that, what, when he got shot in the ear and the...  Oh, the head shot.  Oh, with the clogged.  Yeah, great effects on that.  What about his buddy, Mustang Sally's buddy, in the corner, he's got a gut shot.  He pulls the chair up to his face to protect himself.  He's like, no, no more. 
[01:31:00]  But he puts it right in the chair seat, right through it into his head.  So he backed away in the house.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, you know what I'm waiting for, the rapist, the rapist act with the psychiatrist.  Oh, yeah, they'll put that back into play.  They're going with a few different storylines, and they kind of put it off a week or two.  I think they're doing a good job with that.  Yeah, good series so far, real good series.  And what?  Hey, how'd your show go the other night?  I was supposed to go to the road show.  The road show?  Oh, we're getting great reviews, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I was supposed to go. 
[01:31:30]  I couldn't get a babysitter.  I'm pissed.  We're working on bringing the road show to the next level.  We should have details soon, so.  Did you guys have the musical chairs?  No, we didn't.  No, it was, uh...  Listen to the show sometimes.  I know.  We talked about all this.  I know.  We did like two hours on the road show on Friday.  I listened to it during traffic, you know what I mean?  And now I'm home, and I got to go home and eat.  It was sort of bad to wake up in the morning, you know what I'm saying?  It was kind of the R-rated version of the road show.  Okay.  We didn't go X this time around. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  Thanks, Joe.  All right, you guys.  Bye.  And the scene with Tony getting pulled over was great, too.  Yo, boys.  What's going on?  He thought he was Psycho Mark.  Right.  Yeah, pulling out the PVA car.  He pulls out the car.  Hey, I was just having a little dinner with your boss.  Maybe you want to go out and have some dinner with him.  Talk it over with him.  Is that a bribe you're offering me?  And who is that?  Charles...  Dutton.  I was...  Yeah, yeah.  I forget the name.  The Rock.  The Rock.  The Rock Rock.  And, uh...  Yeah, so obviously Tony's got a stick up his ass for him right there. 
[01:32:30]  But that's how I worked the PVA car.  Now I'm like, all right, now I know why it never works.  But then he goes, here, could you take it out of your wallet, sir?  Take the license out.  And Tony's like, ah, now there's a problem.  Doughboy.  Yo, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Yo, the funniest thing is when Meadow's bike was stolen,  the look on Tony's face when it was a black guy...  Yeah, he starts laughing.  You just know what he's got to go into.  It's funny.  Good show.  Adios, boys.  All right.  The charcoal briquette. 
[01:33:00]  Charlie, you're up, man.  What's up?  I was reading online, it said next week Meadow's supposed to lose the virginity to that blackhead.  To Noah.  Now, I'm watching the previews for next week, which, you know, they never give you enough.  Leaves you to drool in for more.  And it looks like something's happening.  All I saw was they were kissing, kind of laying down.  And were they undercovers?  Yeah, they were.  And what do you think?  Yeah.  It goes by so far.  I got to tape the upcoming preview so I could just run through it for an hour like it's 
[01:33:30]  an episode.  Do you think Tony's going to be disappointed that his daughter's going to have sex with  a nigger?  He's using the jargon of the Sopranos.  Don't use that language on our air.  We'll have to wait a second.  But, no, of course he'll be pissed.  He's going to kill the kid.  Dino.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, what's going on with this Meadow thing, man?  I'm telling you, Tony is going to take that kid out.  Watch.  It's ridiculous.  Why?  Is that girl so high? 
[01:34:00]  I mean, she's got to be with this kid?  Well, maybe she'd like some.  Aw, come on, dude.  Look at him.  He's a dog.  If that isn't like a cry of help or a cry for, oh, my God, I need love for my daddy or something.  Holy Jesus.  Come on.  That's crazy, man.  It is.  Put in that situation with that entrenched in her head from her family, the best way  to get back at her father is to do this.  You're insane.  Why?  Maybe the guy's just a college kid from a good family. 
[01:34:30]  He's got somebody in his family or something.  That just happens to be black.  I ain't saying it that way.  I'm not saying she's doing it on purpose, but subconsciously, that's what's going on.  Man, if you're going to do it, you've got to stay with your own kind.  If you're going to get back at your father, if you're going to get back at your father,  though, I mean, you know, play this game, you would find a Mickey Rivers black.  Oh, my God.  The kid is just a college kid from a good family that happens to be, you know, half black  or whatever.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, the beginning when they were in counseling together, Tony and his wife with the shrink.  Right.  And they're just fighting back and forth.  And so it's just like, yeah, I love you, too.  It was really going out.  It was pretty good.  I'll probably be alone here, but I hate the shrink scenes.  Hate it.  Slow moving.  Well, last night was pretty good.  I want more action and more storyline.  I just hate all of a sudden, oh, here he is, talking to the shrink. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  I know it's finally good last week with the whole rape thing thrown in, but it's just,  I know it's important to the, you know, the show, but every time they go to it, oh, oh,  oh, I got to sit through this five minutes to get back to the, like, the action, more  interesting storylines.  Yeah.  Jay, what's going on?  Dude, you guys are killing me, man. 
[01:36:00]  I freaking recorded it and I haven't seen it yet.  And now I know Pauly dies.  Now I know everything.  Well, why didn't you turn off the radio?  Because I wanted to hear it.  Oh.  Another thing.  Can I just say one other thing, dude?  Yeah.  This is Brock that I work with, right?  Yes.  This is a heifer.  All right?  And I'm like, I mean heifer, brah.  And she was giving me flack because she heard me talking on the radio to you guys and  stuff.  I just want to say, hey, hey, my last day is Thursday, kissed my ass by a stepmaster.  All right.  I'm going to listen to myself on the radio. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  Later.  Should we just go to the next phone call or should we warn people?  That alone would just warn people.  Yeah.  Okay.  This is a possible Sopranos spoiler.  This next phone call.  We don't know for sure.  Because let me tell you something.  How many calls last week said it was Noah that gets his head beat in with the golf club?  How many times did we hear that last week?  And that was bull.  Right.  So I don't know.  This is a spoiler.  It's the last call we take before a break.  So then you can come back in five minutes if you don't want to hear this next call. 
[01:37:00]  Okay.  All right.  We just warned you.  And people will still call up and go, Dick, you just ruined it.  You're right.  Let's go to John.  John, what's up?  That's a lot of pressure, guys.  I can't believe you did that.  That's all right.  I don't want to ruin it.  What have you heard?  All right.  I was at my aunt's house yesterday.  I don't watch the show.  Okay.  But they're like, they're Italian.  Okay.  They're set on.  She was driving through Nutley or Belleville.  She lives over there in Nutley.  She saw the funeral scene with that kid that you're talking about.  Noah.  Is that his name?  The black kid? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  She saw that funeral scene being filmed and she said he dies, definitely.  Well, you don't have to be Kreskin.  I'll figure this out.  Oh, I'm just saying.  I don't watch the show and I'm not trying to ruin it.  But I've heard things.  I've heard things.  I heard it from my aunt.  Yeah.  How did she know it was him?  Because she was there watching.  They film all around Belleville and Dork and all that.  Yeah.  So your aunt watches The Sopranos.  And what did she go up and see, what, a casket?  I guess they stop and they watch the whole damn thing. 
[01:38:00]  They watch from wherever they can watch.  I don't know if extra's going to watch.  And what?  If it's outside and they're burying them, you never see who's in the casket.  So how did she know it was him?  Yeah, we need a little more info, right?  I think the actor might have been on the set.  She was there for like five hours.  Why would he be on the set if he's dead?  They don't need him anymore.  If there was an inside funeral scene, he'd have to be in the casket.  No, they would do that somewhere completely different and totally at another time.  You know how long it takes to set up a shot, especially outdoors?  Okay, I'm just saying I heard things.  I don't know. 
[01:38:30]  All right.  Maybe it was The Sopranos.  I'm going to go back and tell her what you said.  She ain't going to be pleased, but I'm going to tell her what you said.  Get her on the...  You're going to be pleased.  Get her on the show.  All right, guys.  All right, man.  Get her on the show and we'll talk to her about it.  The Sopranos may be doing a Survivor thing.  Because there's all those rumors out there already on the Internet that this is what's  going to happen.  Maybe it never happens.  Oh, come on.  Guys got to get it.  And if that's a very important scene for this year's episodes of The Sopranos, I think you 
[01:39:00]  would film it where no one is able to...  Right.  Figure it out.  ...to view that scene.  Mm.  He's so dead.  He's so dead.  Whew.  Rick, you're dead.  Alan, what's going on?  Yo, did you guys see Adriana yesterday when she gave her two weeks' notice?  She looked hot.  She's ridiculously hot. 
[01:39:30]  My God.  They need to get that ass shot of her again.  Or her flirting with that tennis pro.  Oh, yeah.  How about that?  What about Jamie Lee?  She's looking hot this year, too.  Yes, she is.  She looked real hot in that argument with her father last night when they were talking about  the black guy who stole her bicycle.  You know, she's great.  And unfortunately, you know, she's too scared to come back on our show.  Well, you know what it is?  Well, not you guys.  The call is they ruin it.  They ruin all the contests. 
[01:40:00]  They ruin everything.  And you, too, Hope.  You ruin it, too.  Like you wouldn't do Jennifer Lopez.  I know.  You wouldn't do her, you're telling me?  She has an unbelievable, well...  Dude, dude.  All right, listen.  You wouldn't do her.  All right, hold on, hold on.  I mean, I'm a guy.  Of course I would.  But, I mean, she's not one of my faves like everyone else.  Yeah, but, you know, who needs favorites?  You know, a lot of times some people are by themselves.  You know what?  Let's revert that.  I mean, my favorite is Vanessa Williams.  You know, I ain't going to do her.  So, you know, you got to settle for what's around. 
[01:40:30]  Alan, let's revert back to past O&A shows.  When you're talking about someone like a Vanessa Williams, a J-Lo, an Anna Kornikova, a Britney Spears, Julia Roberts, whatever, whatever you're into, a Kate Hudson, it's in that fantasy world.  And what do we say about that?  They have to be perfect.  Yeah, I got you.  Right.  I got you.  Fantasy's got to be perfect.  Like, of course, if I had the chance, I would do Jennifer Lopez.  But when you're talking about those fantasy girls, you know, she's hurting.  Yeah, I still don't see it, dude. 
[01:41:00]  I'm from the Bronx, and she's from the Bronx, and she's like every Puerto Rican girl I couldn't get when I was in high school.  So you like the Puerto Ricans with the big bucks?  They're hot, bro.  You have to grow up around them to know what I'm talking about.  Know what I'm talking about.  Yeah, know what I'm talking about.  And I'm a black guy, not an Italian guy.  Drink bastards.  That was pretty good.  Thanks, Alan.  All right.  All right.  A lot of people are thinking that because Meadow took the bugged lamp that's down in the basement, 
[01:41:30]  that maybe some FBI guy is going to come by with some equipment, listen in, hear her having sex with Noah,  and then slip a little tape to Tony, you know, to just piss him off.  Like, hey, Tony, listen to this.  An anonymous little tape.  Imagine the scene, Tony playing a tape of his daughter getting railed by this guy.  Oh, God, that's great.  Charcoal briquette.  What a rule.  Let's go to Chris. 
[01:42:00]  Chris, what's going on?  Chris?  Yeah.  Hey, you're on the radio.  Hey.  I was watching The Coming Attractions, and when they showed Meadow with Noah and what appeared to be his father at dinner,  he's like, so, Meadow, what's your father do?  So I think that his parents are going to find out who Tony is and not let the kid see Meadow anymore.  That'll be the end of him.  His parents are going to get scared.  Well, let's, I don't know, that's going to be interesting. 
[01:42:30]  We'll see what happens.  All righty.  Thanks, Chris.  Bye-bye now.  Bye.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, did you guys see the roommate?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The roommate's out of her gore.  A drunken hose bag roommate.  Yeah, I think she was screaming at Meadow.  I think they got something going on.  I think, well, you kind of, yeah, there's got to be some kind of lesbian thing.  I don't think Meadow's into it, but I think that girl finds Meadow really, really attractive and really wants her. 
[01:43:00]  And Meadow's not going to pay any attention to her, and that's going to start a little riff.  Because, I mean, God, the first day of school, she's showing off her body.  Her panties.  Her panties and bra.  The panties.  Hey, two hot college girls together like that in a room.  Never know what would happen.  Real sex on the Sopranos.  All right.  She's out of her gore, though.  Something's going to happen there.  I think so.  She's like single white female.  She's going to walk in looking like Meadow soon.  Yeah.  Opie, I actually have a little audio from the Sopranos. 
[01:43:30]  It's Tony listening to the tape of Meadow getting railed by Noah.  Turn it off.  Wow, that doesn't sound like Tony, but turn it off.  Really?  Turn it off.  She sounds a little angry, I think.  Turn it off.  Oh.  God.  God.  One more. 
[01:44:00]  Turn it off.  Oh, please.  Very nice.  All right, Anthony.  Let's take a break.  All right.  People are voting for the Best Ass Contest as we speak.  Very easy.  Go to WNEW.com.

[01:44:30]  Dr. Bob is here.  And Stephen Lynch is here.  Nice.  Lots more show to go.  We got to talk about Caroline's over the weekend, because Lynch was hanging out.  We were having a blast after the Regan show.  Cole, we'll get into that next.  Hey, this is Jim Brewer, and I've been up since, like, oh, I don't know, yesterday.  And the only thing that gets me going, Hammer, is O.P. and Anthony.  I'm talking 1027.  N-E-W, Hammer, I'm going to pee. 
[01:45:00]  Jim Brewer in the studio.  Get down!  I can't hear you, Mother Album!  A lot of people really think so.  I'll never do it on their way!  It's O, it's A, it's J, and Stephen Lynch, Mike DiNicola around here somewhere. 
[01:45:30]  Recouping.  And Jim Brewer in the background.  And Dr. Bob waiting to get in.  He's been waiting five years to get on our show, and now he's waiting outside the studio.  He's a good guy, Dr. Bob.  He is good.  And we'll get him in here in a minute.  He wants to talk about the one-hour orgasm.  I want it.  I want the book.  I want the tape.  One hour of orgasming.  One hour?  One hour.  It lasts one hour?  We're going to have to ask him.  What's the wait?  Wow.  Who's tuning on an hour?  Right.  You have a little wait there.  What?  I said F something. 
[01:46:00]  I meant to say truck.  What?  You can't after the fact try to throw a patch on it.  No, I didn't even mean it that way.  It's in the censor's dirty, own little minds they hear it that way.  Right.  Exactly.  God damn.  Because they're pinpricks.  Hey, you guys got to talk about what happened at Caroline's after the Brian Regan shows.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to go grab a coffee.  Really?  Why?  Because you want it there. 
[01:46:30]  Because I'm jet-lagged.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he just got one of those espressos.  He just got back from Paris.  Yeah, the espresso.  Keep the Nicole away from the coffee machine.  He's not fleet of foot.  You want to be nimble around that thing, all right?  You don't want people waiting in line for the coffees.  He's got a broken ankle.  He's hobbling around like he's on Fraggle Rock without the costume.  It's like you met him under a bridge someplace.  He's like, hey, buddy, I need some coffee.  You want to get out of the way?  Coffee.  Okay, Jay.  You want some brandy, maybe, to clear that up? 
[01:47:00]  Brandy?  No, right?  Now, hook him up with some brandy.  Make sure he's okay.  Hook him up with some brandy.  I don't want to see that mother effer again.  Come on, the Godfather.  Remember that?  Paulie, they send him out?  He's pouring the J-Lo sunglasses, too, I see.  J-Lo sunglasses?  Yeah, I can Paris will change you.  What is that?  Ah, that's right.  He was in Gay Paris.  I'm going to watch this over there.  Look at these shorts I got.  It's a thong, and I don't want to see it.  He's got the J-Lo's.  Yo, J-Lo. 
[01:47:30]  So what's going on with the...  God, we're just recouping, man.  Yeah, between the Roadshow Thursday and then Friday, just the pandemonium.  You know, it's got to be said, we all went to Caroline's for the Brian Regan shows, and  Brian Regan killed, but there is a bunch of you tools out there that just wrecked the  end of a couple of the shows by screaming out of it.  Yeah, man.  That was a word.  Can you let the guy just do his act?  Poor Regan, man.  I was so pissed, because the guy is one of the funniest guys you'll ever see.  I still think he killed, but you just got to know when you go into some of these comedy 
[01:48:00]  clubs that there are some comedians, like a Rich Voss or a few of those guys, that just  go with whatever's happening in the club, and then there are people like Brian Regan  that wants to do bits and doesn't want to interact with the crowd, because his material is good  in another way.  That's because he sucks.  Shut up, Regan.  No, I know.  He sucks.  If he can't move the crowd, then he sucks.  I don't care what the...  That's not true.  No, Brian Regan.  That's not his gig.  That's not his gig.  Regan sucks. 
[01:48:30]  There's no arguing.  That's not his gig.  That's not his gig.  He's a Canadian.  He's gay, for one.  You ass.  And he's Jewish, I've heard.  He's not his gig.  But people are yelling out loud.  I'm screaming out a bit.  Screaming out a bit.  Snow cold.  Snow cold.  Snow cold.  Take all of one's his son.  And son.  Snow's son.  And Brian's the snow's son.  First snow, then sun.  And then both, same time.  Top of snow's son.  Yeah, and then Brian, like, you know, because he's...  He's so nice and stuff, so he stops his whole act and say, what? 
[01:49:00]  And then all of a sudden, there's like 12 other people jumping in with other bits.  Don't you hate pants?  Did he just pistol whip somebody when he got home?  God damn Marty and say, I hate him.  I've never seen him snap or lose it.  Oh, I was waiting for the curse.  Yeah.  I can't keep him quiet, Marty.  F you, mother effin' a-hole.  I'm giving a kid.  I've got to do a routine on him.  I'm having a sham.  And between the 10.30 and 12.30 show, he was doing shots at the killer.  And he goes, I never drink. 
[01:49:30]  But the 10.30...  Our crowd drove him to drink.  Yeah, the 10.30 crowd at the end.  It was just a swear.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah.  Mike.  Hey.  I just wanted to thank you guys.  That crowd was out of hand at 10.30.  That was my first time seeing Regan.  Yeah.  And he killed.  But I was so, like, I left there mad because those people, like, do the science fair.  Yeah.  He was going to do it all, but...  That's a great topic that you guys are talking about. 
[01:50:00]  It's pertinent because you have so many comedians in here, and you can tell it's a great message  that when you go see comics, don't be screaming around like an idiot.  Well, there's some guys...  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  There are some guys...  Do that at the tourist town.  They can handle it, and they're into that.  You know, they feed off that.  Right.  But there's other comedians.  They're focused in another way, and they don't want to be distracted.  Not only that, how about when you're doing something, you're doing a bit, and the punchline  comes after a short pause.  Right.  And makes the whole bit.  There's no pause now.  And then you throw in the punchline, and five people yell out the line the second you stop 
[01:50:30]  talking.  Let me up the end.  Jackass.  Five?  How about before he did the Big Yellow Ones of Sun, everyone's screaming out, Big Yellow  Ones of Sun, where he had to do the big, and then he goes, well, this will come as a big  shot.  Yeah, that's the punchline, but I'll do it anyway.  And then right before he goes to Big Yellow Ones of Sun, everyone goes, The Big Yellow Ones  of Sun.  Jackass.  Let me up the ante on you.  How about when you're waiting at one pause to do your punchline, and the sea suckers yell  out Marco.  You ever think of that?  Oh, that one too. 
[01:51:00]  Sure.  Sure.  He's not here.  I don't know the man.  He's not coming to rascals.  We've got to keep comments off of this show.  It's for their own good, I think.  And it's, you know, it wasn't even the whole crowd.  It was like one or two guys that just ruined it.  Right, right.  Ruined it to 300 other people.  Oh, oh, oh, okay.  It was one particular guy, and he was talking to Regan afterwards.  I just wanted to touch him.  John, what's up?  John.  Bastards.  John.  Yeah.  Cut the dirt, man.  You cut the dirt.  Yeah.  I know.  Was that you? 
[01:51:30]  You mean you want him to do it right now?  I want him to do Cup of Dirt.  Opie, do Cup of Dirt for him.  Just do it.  Opie, it's your favorite.  And, come on, Fresca.  Bunch of tools.  You guys are the best friends a comic could ever have.  See, we're the double-edged sword.  We'll fill that club.  We'll put the asses in the seats, and God damn it, I hope you got the door deal.  Because you're going to be harassed.  Yeah.  With no mercy. 
[01:52:00]  That's all right.  Well, the fans are rabid, but it is love.  Like, Regan, you said, you don't know whether to be annoyed or flattered.  That's what I said.  Go with annoyed.  It is so...  I'll take annoyed.  But it's still, you know, it's not like, Cup of Dirt sucks.  It's Cup of Dirt, we love you.  But you know what it is?  People, you know, you guys especially, you could get up there and just dole it back to  them.  You kick their ass.  You say whatever.  Dole it out.  You dole it out to them.  A dollop of butter.  A dollop of doling. 
[01:52:30]  And you give them hell back.  You know?  All right.  I banged it right in your dollop.  I brought that tape to France of you guys doing George's advice.  Are we as genius as Jerry Lewis?  I didn't play for the French.  They don't deserve it.  I played it for my best friend.  He was screaming.  I liked it.  I was talking to the fake puppet.  That puppet is way too mean.  That's not the same puppet.  Of course, you went to Paris for action.  Yeah, they bought action without bleeps or anything. 
[01:53:00]  It's really fun.  I saw Eric Clapton my first night in Paris.  Oh, yeah?  He did the whole show in French there.  It's not a show.  Leila!  Oui, je t'ai la gloire!  It's like, what?  All right.  Come on.  So discuss what happened at Caroline's afterwards.  Oh, after.  You know, you get Regan.  You get Regan on.  It's, you know, great.  He's a great comic.  And then they follow it up.  And I don't know why the hell I stay.  With a hypnotist. 
[01:53:30]  And, you know, there's nothing better and more legit,  and more believable than a goddamn comedy club hypnotist act.  Because it's the biggest load of crap.  Yeah, screw it.  I could put a big...  I could just snap and put the teller at the bank asleep  and make him go to the vault and get me conjecture.  But I'm going to sit here and hack it out in front of a Caroline's half crowd  until four in the morning.  Because I love me.  Yeah, there are 50 people there.  Oh, I got the power to just snap my fingers  and put this fat slaw up to sleep  and start sucking on a banana like it's my C. 
[01:54:00]  You know, it's late when you go on after Norton.  So they get up there and they got like...  It's a prom crowd and, you know, it's the Dirty Show.  So, you know, it's always fun to see Otto and George at the Dirty Show.  But there's some comics up there that it's just like,  all right, hey, I'd like to F that prom queen there.  Did you stick your C in her?  You know, these little girls are freaking out and stuff.  You know what you say to those comics if you're in the audience? 
[01:54:30]  Cup of Dirt!  Cup of Dirt!  The yellow ones, the sun!  You know, Ann, we kind of became those people that we hated at the reading show.  We were so freaking annoying.  The tables would turn around and little beers in  and we're doing Homer Simpson the entire night.  Be more penny!  The only character allowed at the table was, yeah, Homer Simpson.  So we're sitting there and the hypnotist gets up there  and he starts doing his stuff.  And we were just like, he snaps his fingers and goes to sleep  and one of us just stands out and goes,  well, I'm sold. 
[01:55:00]  It has to be real.  Look at his tan.  There's this little troll guy with this big 70s pearl mustache and a tan.  I would rather hear Lisa play her saxophone.  Look, he's quacking like a duck.  This is great.  And we're doing this the whole freaking night.  And they're getting so annoyed.  And that big bruiser guy, the Macarena guy,  holy smoke.  Jay, have you seen the Macarena guy? 
[01:55:30]  You were telling me about it.  It was incredible.  Oh, you told me about the Macarena guy.  This guy's act is he gets out there  and does other races version of the Macarena.  So the Macarena plays, you hear it 10 times during his act.  And he starts doing the dance.  And the Hispanic one,  he ends up up against the wall in the frisk pose.  Ho, ho, probably mildly amusing in 95.  It's funny because it's so timely.  He turns out,  Ooh, this is topical. 
[01:56:00]  I like the dance.  Do a three-mile island bit.  That hysterical.  So he's doing that.  He's doing the Polish one  and the Hispanic one  and the black one  and the Italian Macarena.  He does it every time.  Let me guess,  when he did the Polish Macarena,  did he poke himself in the eye or something?  Ho, ho.  Oh, the Italian one.  He's doing all the Italian, you know, FU things.  Grabbing his crotch for the black one.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, the black one was the frisking.  Oh, was that the frisking?  What was the Hispanic one?  Oh, maybe. 
[01:56:30]  I don't know.  I think that was a rape.  I don't know.  Then the two female rock stars.  Katie Lang.  Oh, awful.  So then it ends up  that the Macarena comic  is the assistant for the hypnotist.  So he's going around,  you know,  leaning over the tables  and going,  okay,  just agree with everything.  Get up on the stage  and do whatever the hell  he tells you to do.  Hey, we got a volunteer.  Okay, go up there.  I'll punch you in the face  if you don't do it.  You'll have to listen  to more of my Macarena act  if you don't go up there  and just agree with everything he says  and make like a hypnotist.  Hey, we got another volunteer. 
[01:57:00]  So you get all these rubes up there  that just want to be part of the act.  So what are some of those?  They doled out a bunch of rubes?  They doled out the rubes.  Doled them right out.  You gotta dole out your rubes.  Dole out your rubes, Faber Sam.  A dollop of rubism.  And they're up there  and it is the worst  hack hypnotist act.  Hold on,  Matt's saying you're a tool.  Uh, Matt,  why is that...  Yo, what's up?  Why is that a tool?  Hey, what's up, baby?  Hey.  Listen,  hey, you're such a tool, man.  That freaking hypnotist rules.  Are you kidding?  A girl said...  No, man, 
[01:57:30]  what's your way to talk?  You tell me when that chick  was dethorting that banana,  that wasn't the stuff.  Dude,  that was the fattest chick  and she's doing this banana.  Yeah, but you know the fattest chick  know how to do it the best?  No.  Her technique was good,  but I gotta tell you.  Actually,  I don't know that.  It was disturbing to watch  and you think that was hypnotism?  Yeah.  You think he just got up there,  he starts talking  and snaps his fingers  and everybody's head  falls to the side?  Oh, that...  Come on,  you saw some of the people  that got off the stage later? 
[01:58:00]  Oh,  and the ones that were left  were the ones that really hypnotized.  The guy didn't even do  any mumbo-jumbo.  He walked back and both going,  okay,  what you're gonna do  is you're gonna feel relaxed.  You're gonna feel relaxed?  I'm gonna snap my face  and now I'm gonna  tuck down the shoulder  and your head's gonna go down.  Boom!  And they're out.  Why didn't you do that  at the bank teller?  It's not something  you're going to do  out of your room.  You gotta do some mumbo-jumbo.  You're doling!  Do the mumbo-jumbo  if you got rooms up there  that's your dole down on.  I told Monaghan  to dole out my money.  Let's be honest.  How much does it take  to get a fat chick  to deep throw to bananas?  She was black chick. 
[01:58:30]  Is that hypnotism  or is that just like ten bucks?  Yes, food.  It's a food product.  She was eating.  You're never gonna peel  a real penis in your life.  So let me get up there  and kill the bananas  and throw it down your throat!  Why don't you  get in the coffin, sir?  Tommy, what's going on?  Yo, uh...  Yo.  I was hanging out  after the show.  I was with Otto and George  and Dr. Sensitivity.  They were nice enough  to take me down with them.  Yeah.  And you left the C  out of the F word.  All right.  What, you idiot?  I'm in a cave.  All right, go ahead. 
[01:59:00]  And, uh...  I've seen the guy  starting with you.  Yeah.  And he's biting your leg  or something and, uh...  Oh, God, that's right.  Some guy comes up.  This happens in the bar.  Some guy...  He's biting your leg.  He walks over.  Is your problem?  He gets down on the ground  and, like, bites my shoe  because I got my high-top boots.  He bites on my boot  and I'm looking down  and he's growling.  I go,  excuse me.  Growl.  Excuse me.  I would have kicked him  in the teeth at that point.  I would have given the... 
[01:59:30]  So he looks up  and he starts laughing  and he says something  I didn't even understand.  He goes, like,  oh, I know this guy.  Like, I thought he knew somebody.  So it's just like,  hey, whatever.  Get away.  I'd go to court  and just look the judge in the eye  and when he said,  why'd you stomp his face  into soup?  I'd be like,  yo, he was biting my boot.  So then,  so then, uh,  he's back at the bar.  He's totally drunk off his ass.  Now I'm there with Buddy  and, uh, his wife  who's, uh,  my girlfriend's sister.  So, uh,  this guy then comes over 
[02:00:00]  and starts bitching  that our girls  are talking too loud.  And how do you put up  with that crap?  Same guy that bit your foot?  Yeah.  So I turn around  and I go,  dude,  I go,  get the F away from here  because we're going to kill you.  Word.  I go,  you'll be dead.  Just move away  or you're dead.  And you know Buddy.  Buddy played our softball game  with us that day.  He's the big guy  and you don't F with Buddy.  Didn't do much for your team  but he's still a big boy.  Can you strike out?  You don't F with Buddy.  I know.  No, you're stuck out, Jack. 
[02:00:30]  He, he, uh,  he got a bad call.  Like a woman, I see.  He got a bad call  to keep running  when he got to third  and got tagged out at home.  That was Buddy.  And, uh...  Well, the guy I threw out  and that meathead  dropped the ball.  See, see.  Rematch is coming.  Rematch is coming.  Coming up.  Rematch is coming.  Redemption for everyone.  Looks like somebody  put Raul Mondesi  in a celebrity softball game.  El Cañon.  El Cañon.  Oh, it's a new mitt.  If not,  play the car on top of it,  you stupid ass. 
[02:01:00]  I just showed off.  I struck out.  I got to redempt myself.  Redempt?  Well, you did.  Don't allow some redemption.  You did throw a strike  from left field.  Yeah.  I know it.  But I did strike out.  All right.  So, uh...  Buddy's there.  Now, Buddy catches wind  of what's going on.  And this guy will just...  He'll punch this guy  in the face  at the drop of a hat  and walks over  and goes,  Oh, yeah, you smart guy?  Smart ass?  And then the guy  starts, like,  backpedaling and going,  Hey, come on.  It's so cool.  Hey, oh,  big shaved head guy.  And then, 
[02:01:30]  at this point,  I'm turning away  like you turn away  from the TV  during the Pesci scene  in Goodfellas.  He's just like,  Oh, shut up.  No, don't bring up  the shine box.  Shut up.  Because now I'm just  waiting for Buddy to...  You've been away  a long time here, Tommy.  Maybe you don't know.  I ain't doing that  no more.  I ain't doing that  no more.  You know,  Bach, you've been away  a long time.  Hey, come on.  I'm kidding with you.  It's my body.  I pay for the drinks.  I'll get you  every shine box.  Mother!  Keep him here.  Keep him here. 
[02:02:00]  You son of a...  Keep him here.  So now we're  hanging out  and there's just  like a verbal sparring  thing going on.  I don't think  I could afford  to hit anybody  at this point  in my life.  I owe much  too much money  to everyone else.  But the guy  and his buddy  like back off  and turn around  and just continue  being intoxicated.  So we're leaving  and then after we leave  I find out  something else  happened after we left.  And that was  that gorilla boy  flipped the guy. 
[02:02:30]  Right.  Oh, really?  No way.  Please don't take  our water.  Oh, great white gorilla.  We don't attack  our village  and steal  our bottled water.  He's got karate tattoos.  Ah, pussy.  Ah, pussy.  Ah, pussy.  So, yeah,  we find out  that a gorilla boy,  Jeff Norris,  flipped the guy  out front  of the place  after we left.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  Good.  The guy was being  such a jerk-off. 
[02:03:00]  Uh-oh,  here he comes.  Karate tattoos.  Oh, don't take  our water.  Big white gorilla.  Get it,  confident.  Yes, of course,  we all know  Kung Fu fighting.  He's pretty good  at that stuff.  The shine of a good comic,  he can kick your ass.  Everybody was  Kung Fu fighting  That's because  they all dropped  their knives.  Puerto Ricans. 
[02:03:30]  Uh, Anthony,  we got the hypnotist  assistant on the line,  Matt.  Matt, what's that?  Who's this?  Matt.  Matt.  Tell me you hung up.  Hello.  Hello.  Matt.  I heard you suck.  Are you Macarena guy?  I'm Macarena guy.  Oh, my God.  Matt, you got...  Let me do you  a public service.  You've got to  update that act.  Maybe go into  maybe Hands Up.  Hands Up ain't a bad one.  Can you do something  with Hands Up?  What about  Who Let the Dogs Out?  Who Let the Dogs Out?  Listen,  Otto call me.  They told me  you were busting nuts  so I figured  I'd give a call. 
[02:04:00]  Don't drop names.  We all know  who everybody is now.  Doesn't make your act  better because  you know Otto.  Otto didn't call.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe this guy.  Get on above.  Show yourself  you're no talent.  I'm talking about  the hypnotist.  Listen,  how about  how you doing?  I'm talking about  the hypnotist.  Yeah, what about him?  Well, apparently  you guys don't believe  what you're saying.  Look,  there is no way  this guy has the power  to walk back and forth  for five minutes  in front of ten people  and have them  do what he wants to do.  It didn't take five minutes  to do that.  You were there.  All he did was 
[02:04:30]  all right,  what am I going to do?  I'm going to walk back  and forth.  You're feeling easy.  You're feeling relaxed.  You're an auctioneer hypnotist.  Unless you went to the  men's room or something.  It took him at least  ten minutes  to fifteen minutes  to put everyone under.  That's a hypnotist.  Frank Santos.  Okay,  ten minutes.  It took a good  ten minutes  to fifteen minutes  to put everyone under.  Once they,  if we relaxed their body  from top to bottom.  Yeah.  So everyone had to  just sit around  and watch and  hypnotize everybody?  Yeah.  For ten minutes? 
[02:05:00]  Actually,  about that.  That's why you do five?  Because you can't  cover the fifteen?  I can definitely  cover the fifteen.  But,  but you know what it is?  He's walking around,  okay,  he's hypnotizing people,  but Opie,  in between,  like while he's hypnotizing,  he's kind of,  you know,  working the crowd.  Also.  Doing jokes and stuff.  See,  you're that powerful  where you can hypnotize  twenty people  in ten minutes  and entertain  a crowd.  Well,  what are you saying,  Dan,  exactly?  I'm saying that  I don't believe it.  I mean,  what do you think?  We went to Manhattan  and we pulled 
[02:05:30]  thirty people  out of an audience  and we did what?  We paid them  to go under?  No,  no,  I don't say  that they're being paid.  I'm saying  that they're getting  up there  because they want  to be part of the show  just like anybody else.  They want to get up there.  They want to have fun.  You're pretty,  you know,  you're right on right there.  Yeah,  they want to have fun  so they go along with it  so they can stay up there  and be hypnotized  and act like they're hypnotized.  But there's no hypnosis  going on there.  There's none.  Anybody who was going  along with it, 
[02:06:00]  you know,  like playing along with it,  got removed.  They were all  anybody who looked  like they were  playing along with it.  Anybody doing  a reasonable job  of playing along with it.  No,  anyone who was  playing along with it  that we saw  was playing along with it  that was fooling around  and wanted to  make the parts of it  like you guys  don't get rid of them.  Why doesn't he  hypnotize the audience  to make them  think your act is fun?  Oh, Jay.  Oh, my God, Jay.  He's not that good.  Dude,  how killer  was that Macarena act 
[02:06:30]  when it first came out?  The Macarena  is supposed to be updated.  Never had a chance  to do it  nor did I care to do it.  I've got to tell you  because when it first came out  I'm sure that act  was hysterical.  Yeah,  but no one's come out  with new songs  so he's kind of trash.  Who let the dogs in?  Who let the dogs out  as a go?  How you doing?  Who let the dogs out  into the hypnotist show?  Are you?  Yes.  All right.  That would really make it...  Hold on a second.  Yes.  Okay.  Sorry.  What about Freebird?  All right.  I'm being hypnotized.  Thank you, Matt. 
[02:07:00]  So you don't believe it?  You just don't believe it?  No.  Not at all.  We talked about him.  I am a huge non-believer.  I am a huge non-believer.  You believe it,  but not from him.  Do you believe  that people can be hypnotized?  I believe that's prop.  I believe probably clinically  when you go to a hypnotist  to stop smoking  or something,  but it takes sessions.  It takes some kind of  a guy that knows  how to get into your psyche  and...  You're not dedicting yourself  because they have...  It also takes one of those  swinging watches.  Yeah,  not one swinging watch.  You need a swinging watch.  I was at, uh,  spin wheels to stare at me. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah,  where's the spin wheels?  It pulls out of the fingers  right into the eyes  and parts like  under the cherry can of it.  They only take place  in an hour or so.  I was at Stitches in Boston  and Frank Santos was there  and he hypnotized a guy  that when he went to the bathroom  he didn't have a penis.  We did the same thing.  That's not real.  Listen to my story.  Doesn't work.  We did the same thing.  So he said,  when I say the word whatever,  dolphin,  you're going to go to the bathroom  and realize you don't have a penis.  So he says,  dolphin,  this guy gets up.  I'm on the bathroom side  of the room.  I said,  I'm going to go in the bathroom  and take a leak 
[02:08:00]  and watch this guy.  This guy walks in,  pulls down his pants  in the stolen,  I hear coming emails,  pulls down his pants  in the stolen outfit.  He looks at me and goes,  oh my God,  I don't have a seat.  And I go,  what?  I go,  what are you talking about?  You're peeing.  He goes,  no,  you don't understand.  Like the guy was shook up.  No way.  We were alone.  He goes,  dude,  I don't have one.  I'm like,  yeah,  you do.  You're peeing with it,  right?  He goes,  I don't know how.  Oh my God.  I ain't buying it.  I saw it.  What can we do to prove it to you? 
[02:08:30]  There's no way to prove it.  What can we do?  If it could be proved,  it would be done with,  like snake oil.  It's a perfect scenario  because if you're a skeptic,  they say you can't be hypnotized.  Right.  See,  so there's no way to prove it.  Oh,  hypnotize me.  No,  see,  if you're a skeptic,  you can't be hypnotized.  Matt.  Hey,  Matt,  apparently you can only be hypnotized  to something that you would do anyway  deep in your recesses of your psyche,  right?  Well,  the bar you wouldn't do,  in other words,  we couldn't hypnotize you  to go rob a bank  if you wouldn't ordinarily...  Okay,  but by law of average, 
[02:09:00]  we're ready now?  Yeah.  What's to keep you,  if it's in them,  like if you're on a date,  what's to keep you  from hypnotizing a girl  to,  you know,  performing Felicio?  Well,  there isn't.  There's nothing.  So then it's like leathery,  tan hypnotist  is out getting all the best...  Sandy's Goulin-Ellens over here.  No,  then he could hypothetically  be out getting the best tone  in the country.  Hypothetically,  yes.  So what's he doing in a basement  and one in the morning  after Jimmy Orton?  How do you know he's not?  If the guy in the bathroom 
[02:09:30]  had lost his penis,  why didn't he just look  in Jay's mouth?  You can't say anything  on this show,  not.  How do you do it, Jay?  I wonder why people  shout Marco.  He's breathing life  into that.  He was dead for three months.  Nobody even knew  who he was anymore.  You're like,  yeah,  and people yell Marco  and it's annoying.  That's a good career move,  man.  Straight off the mic.  Cheers of putting plans  for the audience.  I didn't even say anything.  All right.  That's the point.  We got to let you go. 
[02:10:00]  He's full.  All right.  He's got a Macarena act.  He's going to sell more tickets  in your next show  because you're sitting here  like,  you're going to think  about what you're doing  over here.  All right,  man.  Thank you.  Hey,  thanks,  man.  We'll have you on again,  all right?  Yeah,  appreciate it.  Discuss this further.  Take care,  brother.  We got to get Dr. Bodman  because he just told us  he has to leave at 6.05.  Oh,  damn.  He's been waiting to get on  our show for like two hours.  And now we got to learn  how to have hour-long orgasms.  In 15 minutes.  In 15 minutes.  We're going to have to learn  in 15 minutes.  Four minutes a minute.  Damn.  Dr. Bob,  you didn't tell anyone  you had to leave at 6.05. 
[02:10:30]  No.  What's in the manager?  You know,  you guys got to,  they got to keep you happy  because when you're happy,  you guys do the best job  on radio I've ever heard.  He's a better head  than just the radio.  We were very angry.  Well,  I know.  The sign in,  you know,  it's stupid,  but I got an idea for you.  Yeah.  You get Opie,  and Anthony condoms  and give them to homeless guys  to give out  as people drive,  you know,  into the town.  Homeless guys.  Yeah,  I'd take a condom  from homeless guys.  That's right.  I've been using this myself, 
[02:11:00]  but I'd like you to have it now  as a souvenir of New York  and open.  Or maybe some of those  attractive ladies  with the...  Yeah,  that's a better idea.  Now I know why you're a doctor.  You know.  Right,  the ass contest.  Yes.  Now you are a doctor.  What type of doctor?  A PhD.  You are a PhD.  My degree is in behavioral philosophy.  I study what works  and what doesn't.  The problem with sex  is most guys  think they know more  than they do.  Heh heh. 
[02:11:30]  And the more they grab,  the worse I find they are.  Really?  Yeah,  and the biggest complaint  I get from women  is that,  you know,  they say guys act  the same way  in the bedroom  as they do  out there on the roads.  They get lost  and they won't  pull over  and ask for instructions,  you know.  Ah.  Keep driving  until they fall asleep  or run out of gas.  I thought I had  sea rage  or something like that.  I thought that was  what you were talking about.  The lost direction.  Doctor,  let me ask you this.  Like,  I know I'm  really good at sex.  Like,  I know it. 
[02:12:00]  My wife's pretty hot.  She's been in here  and you couldn't keep  something like that around  unless you bought her  a lot of jewelry  and I don't.  So like,  if the conversation comes up,  like if I'm at the gym  and the girl's like,  you know,  we start having innuendos,  I'm going to let them know.  Like,  I'm going to make them shake.  You know what I mean?  Now,  do women automatically think  that I'm full of BS?  No,  here's the problem.  The guys that are  the most famous,  the richest,  the most handsome  get lied to  by women  more than anybody else.  Oh,  they're lying.  It's like  the hypnotist skeptic thing. 
[02:12:30]  There's no winning.  It's a monkey paw.  I got castrated.  It doesn't happen.  You've got to be careful,  you know,  because this is a problem.  If you're expecting the woman  to point out your mistakes  to you in the bedroom,  you shouldn't hold your breath.  Women learned a long time ago  how sensitive our egos are.  And when I named the book  The One Hour Orgasm,  most guys thought I was  including dinner in the title.  But we're talking about  going from 10 seconds  up to an hour.  Now,  when you know how to do that,  you really have confidence. 
[02:13:00]  You really,  you sort of exude this confidence.  Take a feeding off a brick wall.  And these guys  that know this technique  wind up with women  of higher quality  than they deserve.  I would think you're from.  Now,  doctor,  who's having the hour-long orgasm?  Either.  Well,  if the woman learns  how to do it to the guy,  she can also keep  his orgasms going for an hour.  Going for an hour.  You look like King Gimp  at the Oscars last year.  I swear to God,  just writhing on the floor.  Most guys think  if that was to happen to them,  they'd become dehydrated 
[02:13:30]  and have a heart attack.  No way.  But that's not the way it works.  Speak, doctors.  Guys get confused  about orgasms.  We think it's the spurting,  the ejaculation thing.  Right, right.  That's not the orgasm.  No.  No.  The orgasm  are those contractions  that happened before.  That's what feels so good.  Next time you have an orgasm,  just pay a little bit  of attention  and notice when the  ejaculation starts,  it feels like something,  but it mostly just feels  like you're urinating.  It's nothing to work  right home about. 
[02:14:00]  I feel like I'm passing  a volleyball.  So concentrate on the feeling  and what it is  and try to identify  what's going on.  Contractions.  Contractions.  Mime them.  Orgasmic contractions.  I'm going to  crack one out right now.  Listen, most women  have about 9 to 12  during an orgasm.  Guys' contractions  are less.  They have shorter.  But you can have  hundreds and hundreds  of them using  this technique.  We brought you the video  so you can do  a little show prep.  But it shows you 
[02:14:30]  how to do the technique.  And if the woman  learns how to do it  to the guy  and she learns  how to access  his G-spot  at the same time,  she can actually  do something  that's unbelievable.  She can add  one to three inches  to your normal size.  Hey, what?  Time out, though.  I'll take the three inches,  but I think finding  the G-spot involves  my ass.  You're close.  It's kind of...  Close?  The other term  is the taint.  Ah.  Oh, okay.  I'm fine with that.  The old taint.  Yeah, it's the perineum. 
[02:15:00]  And if she learns  how to access that  and do this...  Access it?  What's that?  An ATM?  No, no, no.  What the hell's that?  No, no.  And if she learns  to do this and the...  It's the Venus butterfly  technique is actually  what it is.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  So her head  is somewhere.  No.  She can do it  with her head.  No, don't you?  You're supposed to say,  yes, the head.  Get down there.  Get down there.  But the big problem today,  and a lot of your listeners  are experiencing this.  I've been on Oprah  six times 
[02:15:30]  in the last few months.  But there's...  That fat whore.  Honor show  or just honor?  When it's on the front cover  of Newsweek magazine,  so it's invalidated.  I rolled over twice.  I was still on top of it.  But there are  30 million women  out there  that are losing  their sex drive  and it's driving  30 million men  absolutely nuts.  See,  what works  during the honeymoon period,  during that first part  of the marriage,  usually doesn't work  afterwards.  And so after  a period of time  like six months  to three years  or one or two kids, 
[02:16:00]  things start to slow down  for most people.  That's when you just  got to get more physical.  You know,  a couple of quick rides.  A couple of quick rides.  Leave with a jab.  That's work for me  plenty of times  in various hotel rooms.  Mike Tyson,  that works for him?  Thank you.  Michael?  Yes, thank you.  Mike Tyson,  have you ever had  a one-hour orgasm?  Yeah,  she quibbered for an hour  as I punched her  in the vulva.  I always thought  that was an automobile.  The show's just like Oprah,  huh?  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  So now,  there's techniques  then that have to be used  and you have a video.  Now,  is this video,  is it going to be  hot to watch  or clinical?  Yeah,  no,  there it is.  And I don't want to see  some guy explaining  how his job does this event.  these are,  we got couples  to volunteer  to let us teach them  these techniques  for the first time  because we wanted  to show you  the mistakes  that people usually make  and what happens  when you correct them.  Hot amateur actions  and this one woman  orgasmed for so long 
[02:17:00]  her first time  that we ran out of film.  Whoa!  Yeah,  so you'll get inspired  by that.  But it looks easy  but it's not as easy  as it looks  but it's not that hard.  Do you just have her  on the tape  going like,  you know,  just quivering  and freaking out  for an hour?  What is she,  an old medicine woman?  It's raining,  relax.  But we have  a lot of other techniques  like we used  one of Sam Kineson's,  the late Sam Kineson's,  not his driving ability.  The alphabet.  The alphabet  but we did a spin on it 
[02:17:30]  because a lot of women  have a hard time  telling guys  what really feels good  to them  and we use this  to get women  to open up  and start to talk  about what really  does feel good.  Well,  you know,  most guys  should be able to tell.  If you're in the ballpark,  you're going to get  some reaction  that you're in the right spot.  But the doctor's saying  you can take it  to an entirely  different level  with his video  and book.  Right.  I'm just saying  how is that  that the alphabet  thing is fine  but you should know 
[02:18:00]  and this is probably  in the video  that's available,  Jay,  that you should know  by watching the girl  and checking out  the reaction  if you're doing  the right thing.  Watching might be  deceiving  because we teach guys  to feel  the orgasms.  You can actually  feel them  if you start  to pay attention.  You can't call it  nodding his head  like,  yeah,  no doubt.  Dr. DiNicola,  comment.  Basically,  you're saying listen,  right?  Well,  listen and feel.  Use your head.  Use your eight sides. 
[02:18:30]  You can actually  feel them.  You can feel  the contractions.  Now,  she can fake those  even,  maybe six to twelve.  She can't fake  hundreds of them.  Too broad.  The longest  they ever kept  this orgasm going  at the university  where it came from  was eleven hours.  Eleven hours.  Just kept going.  Yeah.  Just spewing  and spewing.  But don't do that  at home.  Those were trained  professionals.  Oh, my God.  It was just an experiment  just to see how long.  How did you become  a trained orgasm?  Turn a girl 
[02:19:00]  into a rock tumbler.  Going like that  for God's sake.  Spider wants it  really fast.  Spider.  Yeah.  Spider.  Yeah.  Go.  I just wanted  to confirm  the doctors  if he's a doctor  the thing about  those orgasms.  I met a woman  and she's unbelievable  and I get orgasms  for four to five hours  and let me tell you  several  it's just that  incredible  vibrating feeling 
[02:19:30]  that goes through  your body.  The shivers,  the quivers,  everything  and it's  incredibly intense.  I don't know  about that  pain thing  getting there  but  the way she's  not the guy  behind you?  Hey,  there ain't nobody  behind me,  guy.  I don't go that way.  Four to five hours.  It's incredible.  I mean,  I've been sexually active,  very active  for a long time,  lots of women  but this one woman,  she's older than me  by seven years  and she blows away  any woman 
[02:20:00]  that I've ever been with.  She's all of them  combined.  It's the way  that she does  everything  and it's just  an incredible  feeling  to have that  quiver  over and over  and over again.  Why don't you  tell them  the name  of the video?  It's called  For His Eyes Only,  How to Make Sex  More Fun  for Her  and it's got  not only 26 positions  that we want you  to try out,  not only once  but over  and then 
[02:20:30]  the end of the video  is step-by-step  how to do  the Venus Butterfly  technique to your partner  but some of the positions  you don't want to  you want to check  with your chiropractor  before you try them.  Oh really?  Yeah,  they're little  some of them  you just want to watch  you don't want to do.  Others,  anybody can do  but the wheelbarrow  I would recommend  the wheelbarrow.  The wheelbarrow,  one of Opie's favorites  he said that  in the past  on this show.  Yeah.  I like the wheelbarrow.  Very good,  very good.  Four to five hours.  Yeah,  that seems like  this might sound silly 
[02:21:00]  but when you think about it  why would you want that?  No,  it's five hours.  Sounds like a chore.  No,  no,  it's just  in fact  the reason we limit it  to an hour  is just to prove to yourself  you can do it.  Once you've mastered it  then,  you know,  it doesn't matter  if it's three minutes  or longer  as long as it  you know,  you're both enjoying it.  One of the problems  that guys run into  is 70% of women  aren't having orgasms  every time  after the honeymoon period. 
[02:21:30]  Now,  this is a problem  because I tell guys  it's like you're going  to this great restaurant  and the food's incredible  but she has to stand outside  with her nose  pressed up against the glass  watching you eat.  she's going to find reasons  not to go to the restaurant  after a while.  She's going to go  to another restaurant  and start eating  other meat.  but not only that  a lot of guys  it's so important  to guys  to gratify the woman  that they will  sometimes stray  in order to find 
[02:22:00]  a woman that they  can satisfy  or that they think  they're satisfying  but if they keep losing  with the woman  they're with  a lot of times  it means so much  to them  even though it may not  mean that much  to the woman  she might say  it's okay  we'll just cuddle  it's fine  not for him  he wants to ring  the bell  Peter  yeah what's up guys  hey I was wondering  are you able to give  the hour long  orgasm yourself  no  it's like tickling yourself  you can't do it  oh it doesn't work  alone  you need your significance  although in the book 
[02:22:30]  and I don't reckon  a mechanical hand  or something  that might work  about your dog  or dad  that might work  doctor I have a question  for you also  what if you make  your hand fall asleep  yeah if you lay it  on your hand  and make it go to sleep  and then quickly  that might work  what if  about the four hour  type orgasm  can you turn it off  whenever you want  if like the super  comes up  and you're questioning  about the heat  to answer the door  like a drool  and shaking retard  no you  no you can't  sorry  I'm in the middle  of the four hour  could you come back  like in May 
[02:23:00]  I don't think  you'd want to  answer  four hours  no you wouldn't  want to  but what if  it was the cops  or something  that's why  you never know  what's going to happen  you never know  I'm not  four hours  no you can stop  and start  anytime you want  wow  you can take a break  can you do it  it's like TiVo  so when you have  an orgasm  how long  is your average  orgasm  when Dr. Leah  who's my research  assistant  I bet  and wife  and wife  yeah  she is  she is so incredible  with this  where is she 
[02:23:30]  is she hot  oh she's very hot  you know  Dave Barry  the guy who writes  the columns  picked up the book  the one hour orgasm  and he read it  he actually  was one of the few  guys that read the book  and he said  he hadn't had a chance  to try it yet  in his column  but he said  that when he opened  the book  and saw the picture  of Leah in it  he said  if she looked  any happier  you'd have to  shoot her  with a tranquilizer dart  oh  look at you  I will too  now is that bragging sir  because if you're bragging  that means you're not that good  but did you see 
[02:24:00]  that's true  you got me  you got me  but did you see us  on HBO last month  they featured us  the whole month  were you guys naked  no we were the ones  with our clothes  the group hug  naked  the guys out  naked in the woods  to hug each other  and howl at the moon  that wasn't us  what if you have  like a one inch penis  can you still make a shake  oh there you go  women only have nerve endings  for the first inch  up inside their vaginal  so I'm wasting my time  with the other eight  a lot of women 
[02:24:30]  though are as prejudiced  how can you say that  no a lot of women  are as prejudiced  about the man's size  as guys are  about the woman's breast  you know feeling wise  it may not make a difference  but eye candy  it makes a lot of sense  oh right  so she likes the baby's arm  clutching the apple  and my old lady's got  a sugar tooth  Tom wants in here  Tom what's up  hey doc  you say this is  an hour long orgasm  right  yeah  I don't think I have  enough teachers  in my house for that  well see he's not  talking about 
[02:25:00]  the actual  you're not listening  fluid  you know what I mean  you get the feeling  without the fluid  but here's the other thing  and for some reason  this impressed my wife  it never really impressed me  but you can actually  she can get  a double knife  as much as two  during one lovemaking session  hold the phone  two cups  two cups  two  two eight ounce cups  and they did this  two eight ounce cups  in five hours  experiments at the university 
[02:25:30]  in a milking machine  Jesus  I don't want my coffee anymore  I'll have it  send out for more  two cups  so after this  five hour orgasm  the Venus butterfly  looks like she's in a cocoon  right  that's what it means  the reason  wrap her up  you're not in there  as you start to orgasm  the fluids  you know keep  coming out  but most guys  only count the spurts  you woke up  afterwards 
[02:26:00]  and there was  this  it's called the wet spot  yeah the wet spot  well that could be  how do you take it  that drainage  can keep going  although  I don't know why  you're so fascinated with it  it just never got to me  I didn't think  that was a big deal  you wrote a book about it  what do you mean  we're fascinated  you don't think  two cups is a big deal  and what do you do  with the two cups  yeah that's it  two cups  why  I mean  I was excited  about the sensations  and it's not just  how long  I've got to put it 
[02:26:30]  in the freezer  I'd have to save it  oh god  I'd charge a dollar  to see it  right  dude look at this  two cups  title of authenticity  I signed it  right as I  put the jar lid on  what do you do  with the two cups  I don't know  it's not my thing  I'm not  was it really  interested in it  is that considered bio  I would say  it's biohazard  sure  what if you only  have 11 sperm  like me  in a very big ocean  but the main problem 
[02:27:00]  is that most of us  don't learn new skills  later on  I mean we keep  doing the same thing  over and over and over  and when you learn  something new  it brings back  that honeymoon period  because that's one  of the ingredients  in the honeymoon period  that's so cool  is everything's new  and later on  if you want to bring it back  just if you learn  something new  that really works  it produces  some great results  and you get  real excited  I'm sorry  Dr. Opie  Sandy's on line 3  saying listen up  oh Phil  what's up  hey how you doing 
[02:27:30]  I just want to confirm  what the doctor  has got to say here  because I've been  kind of  I'm not privy  to the doc  but I've been doing  kind of technique  of my own  for years  I've been experiencing  yeah yeah  I keep laughing  I've been experiencing  an orgasm  like I don't know  maybe 20 minutes  to the pop  I'm good for  and you know  I tell my friends  about it and stuff  they say  yeah right  yeah right  I'm glad it's finally  out in the open  that this can't happen  maybe I can go  tell my friends  year on 8  20 minutes is nothing  he's talking 4 or 5 hours  and then  I hate  I'm getting the book  because I'm all about  going 4 or 5 hours 
[02:28:00]  oh man I'm up to that  1-800-227-1152  yeah most guys  aren't real creative  when it comes to sex  most guys do  what I call  a rain dance  is this your wife's  vagina  and his hooves  no no no no  what is that  oh my god  you could ever say that  but somebody  you sent us  Opie's picture  on 134  let's see that  134  wow  we're clean shaved  we're calling him  the two hand man now  134 Opie  oh my god  oh god  is that Opie  I mean I 
[02:28:30]  I don't know  couldn't tell  Rick would know  oh god  two hands  wrapped around  it can't be Rick  because it's  junk  it's not an egg roll  doctor why would you  direct us from a page  with a vagina on it  to a page with a penis on it  well you're talking  about two cups  and you get stuck on that  so I don't know  I went with it  how come there's a  close up of a woman's foot  oh this  see I'm a good segue  you're very good  you're very good  most of us only feel  10% of this 
[02:29:00]  10% of the sensation  that's there  10% of the sensation  that's where  you know when you're  orgasming  and how good it feels  it's hard to believe  that's only 10%  when we were in high school  they told us  we only use 10%  of our brain  we believe that  but this is so  impossible to believe  that's only 10%  10% of the pleasure  and this is one of the  techniques that you can  double instantly  the pleasure you're  getting right now  the intensity  and here it's simple  everybody try this  next time you have  an orgasm 
[02:29:30]  I thought right now  it's going to start  no no no  wait no wait  but when you have  an orgasm  most people tense up  they hold their breath  they tighten up  they're trying to hold  on to the sensations  what they do is  they cut off the  circulation  and they end the  orgasm without  believing it  without knowing it  next time  do the opposite  it's called push outs  actually spread your  fingers and toes  next time you start  orgasm  and what will  happen is  am I supposed to  choke her while  I'm doing that  okay 
[02:30:00]  spread your fingers  and toes  and just let  let the energy  fall out  through the ends  of your fingers  and your toes  and that's what  that woman was  doing  we were teaching  her how to  spread her toes  while she was  orgasming  not all you were  teaching her to  spread  hey Ope  look at this  on page 86  it's connecting  and it says  rub your lips  first  and then it  says  with the same  pressure you  were rubbing  your lips  rub your penis  then it says 
[02:30:30]  at the same  time rub your  penis with the  same pressure  at the same  time as you're  rubbing your  lips  then it says  take your  hands off  this is where  it gets weird  for me  hold on  it says  keep switching  back and forth  from your own  mouth  no no this is  instructions for  the women  how to  some guys  I know  some guys  don't like to  kiss  that much  so women  we train  women  how to  connect up  so that he  gets the same  messages  when his lips  are touched  as he does  when his  penis is touched  so he feels  the sensations  in his 
[02:31:00]  genital area  he loves junk  yeah but you  know how when  you get  most guys  when you get  kissed on the  neck you can  feel it in your  genital area  every part of  your body  is connected  we just learn  how to shut  down  no joking  around  how much  pwn do you  get outside  the marriage  what a pick up  line  I have a video  on how to  make you shake  for one hour  here I got  the book with  me I signed  it for you  I'm 502  hurry up  you little  whore  Linda what's  up  Linda  hi  hey  I just  tuned in  and I  would just  love to know

[02:41:30]  you know  yeah let me show you  believable bitch  alright Mario  guys thanks a lot man  stay in touch man  alright thank you  so on the episode  where you get whacked airs  please give us a call back  I will  oh  thanks Mario  Opie you hypnotized  yeah there you go  he must have been hypnotized  well speaking of  being hypnotized  Denny  Denny Moore  hey  how was that  let me tell you something  I had Bubba Ray's girlfriend  on stage once  at a place called  Bari in Belmar  about two years ago  yeah 
[02:42:00]  turned out to be a great subject  gave her an orgasm  right on stage  stop  I did  he didn't hypnotize her  he just banged her  did Bubba hit you  with a table  no no he was cool  he was cool  alright yeah  I'm just  I just have a problem  with the hypnotism thing  you know something  there's really no  resolving this  because I'm a skeptic  I really don't believe it  I don't believe anybody  can hypnotize people  that quickly  in that kind of atmosphere  I mean if you did  why don't you just  go into  Jay Moore  Jay Moore's hypnotized  he's farting into the microphone  why don't you just go into a bank 
[02:42:30]  or something  and hypnotize the woman  they give you money  well they have to be  they have to know  that they're being hypnotized  that's number one  you can't hypnotize someone  without their knowing it  that's number one  number two  is we  it's done on a mass scale  so we start off  with about 20 people on stage  on the average  it's only about 25%  of the people  of the population  that this really works on  it's only about 25%  of the population  that's really susceptible  I can't buy it  when you just walk up and down  in front of the people  and start going  alright you're feeling relaxed  now I'm going to go  and you're feeling sleepy  let me tell you 
[02:43:00]  when I tap you on the shoulder  your head's going to go  oh my god  DeNicola's out  it works  but it's not really that quick  did you guys see the whole show  yeah  from the very beginning  from the very beginning  so you know that  it's a whole process  I mean the whole process  takes about 20 or 25 minutes  before anything really kicks in  so it's not like  I walked up there  and snapped my fingers  and these people  were hypnotizing  yeah but it might as well be  and we also discharged  a lot of people  who were either  A. not responding  or B. faking  oily discharge  hey what's the reason 
[02:43:30]  for the opening act  do you guys do a lot  of coke together  or  that was very cool  we work together  it seems to work out well  yeah  for everyone  except the audience  and plus he's a big guy  so sometimes  you know  hey  who does it  come to Macarena  hey Danny  did you hear Anthony  yelling at you  from the audience  was he the guy yelling  I wasn't yelling  I heard it was somebody  yelling  could have been  Stephen Lynch too  it was Stephen Lynch  did you hear  suck that 
[02:44:00]  yeah I heard it  that was friggin George  Romano and George  a puppet  he was there the whole time  why don't you  hypnotize yourself  that you're dead  get in the coffin  get in the coffin  hey Macarena boy  yeah real topical  get in the coffin  die  when you wake up  you will impale  your skull on my seat  you are very horny  Denny Moore  guys  I will tell you  if you see  Denny Moore  go see him  and judge for yourself  there you go  how's that for a little point  that's probably  the best thing you do 
[02:44:30]  alright  thank you  I thought he was off  I thought we were in a commercial  I absolutely don't buy it  we gotta take a break  we also gotta tell everyone  to vote for the best ass  on WNW.com  the voting  the voting started today  what  no one's voting  for that fat sister ass  that's so nice  which one  which other one  like in the corner  upper right hand corner  upper right  this one  ooh yeah  look at that baby  she got some hitching  her giddy up  we don't have any

[02:45:30]  it's not complete  remasters you know  it's not complete  it's a little weird  because where the song  is supposed to end  it just keeps going  but it works  and it works  in the road show too  it totally works  why don't you just get  I mean how long  are you into the medleys here  why don't you write  like a new song  I'm free of a new song  last week  he wrote a new song  about a girl farting  got a new spoken word piece  for FBA  that Dina Culley's gonna do  then I take it back  you are one of my  favorites Stephen  here's the second verse  well it's the new version
