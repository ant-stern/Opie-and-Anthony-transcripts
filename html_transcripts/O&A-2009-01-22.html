<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts comparing their mundane lives to *Groundhog Day*,  sharing photos of Opie's driver, Denny, and launching into a series of offensive jokes about fill-in host Rich Voss's appearance and business dealings in Canada, employing antisemitic stereotypes.  The conversation veered into personal hygiene, the number of bathrooms in their homes, and a mockery of E-Rock's greasy hair.  They then transitioned to a discussion of Caroline Kennedy's failed Senate bid, criticizing her public speaking and making disparaging remarks about her, along with commentary on Joe Biden's behavior at Obama's inauguration.  The show also touched upon  *Lost*, *Superbad*,  *Blazing Saddles* (deemed the worst ending to a good comedy),  *Milk* (with comments about Sean Penn's performance and a kissing scene),  a proposed kissing contest among male staff members, a "racist Facebook page," and a "Little Hitler" update.

The show also featured a discussion about a new Jim Carrey film and its kissing scene with Ewan McGregor, leading to a humorous exchange about the double standards surrounding nudity in media.  A news segment followed, focusing on a Detroit Fox News report about the Obamas' affectionate relationship, including a "love doctor's" inappropriate comment that was repeatedly played and censored. Rich Voss's attempts to contribute were repeatedly shut down.  A "today in history" segment mentioned Heath Ledger's death anniversary and Steve Perry's birthday, segueing into a discussion about the Unabomber's capture.

A significant portion focused on a New Jersey family whose children were named Adolf Hitler and a name incorporating "Aryan Nation,"  including audio clips of an interview with the mother.  The hosts discussed the absurdity of the situation and potential overreach of child protective services, adding jokes and speculation about the parents' motivations.  Other segments covered Mark Furman's post-OJ Simpson trial career, Casey Anthony, a football camp hazing story, the recovery of US Airways Flight 1549's engines (with related jokes),  "The Hokey Pokey" (claimed to have originated as a cocaine-themed song), and the historical use of heroin in over-the-counter medications, concluding with a personal anecdote about a mental health facility.


A segment featuring Rich Voss in studio opened with a caller describing their experiences in a mental ward.  This led to listener calls detailing childhood exposure to hazardous substances and practices, including radioactive materials, mercury, asbestos, and radiation treatment.  A recurring bit involved Voss mispronouncing celebrities' names.  Further calls recounted more hazardous material exposure stories, a news story about a lighter igniting fumes in a gasoline can, and Opie's farts causing conflict with his girlfriend.  The segment concluded with discussion of the Oscars (Voss admitting to not seeing any nominated films), a "Fudge Pack" bit, and its suitability for the show.

Another segment heavily featured discussion of Oscar-nominated films (*The Reader*, *Revolutionary Road*, *The Wrestler*, *Frost/Nixon*, *The Visitor*, and *Doubt*), with sarcastic and crude commentary from Opie, Anthony, Rich Vos, and a caller named Bonnie (Vos's wife).  The conversation frequently digressed into Vos's personal life (including his sex life with Bonnie, parenting, and childhood insecurities), Oprah and Dr. Oz,  further Oscar nominations commentary, and Vos's detailed account of witnessing his parents' marital problems and feeling abandoned as a child.  Luke in Los Angeles offered an opinion on *The Wrestler*, and other callers participated in the off-topic discussions.

A final segment involved Rich Vos recounting his childhood anecdotes, including his father's arrest, his mother using him and his brother as decoys, his dysfunctional family dynamic, an embarrassing incident at a public pool, and experiences building homemade go-karts.  The segment was punctuated by frequent offensive language and concluded with promotion of Vos's stand-up comedy appearances, his Comedy Central Stand-up Showdown performance, and a discussion of a failed Ashley Madison advertising contest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Now do it again!  I was driving in to work today.  Is it 2012 yet?  Yeah, right.  I was just checking.  No, no, no. You got some time, my friend.  You're gonna have to pace yourself.  Yeah.  You're gonna have to pace yourself.  Apparently so.  We're only one, two days in, depending on... 
[00:00:30]  Oof.  I guess this would be the second day coming up, right?  Second in platoon, you gotta go,  Dude, maybe you just should, like, look at the number of days you're in.  Instead of, you know, how short you are.  Yeah.  I was driving in to work today and I snapped a pic.  Of Denny.  Oh.  And I realized something today.  I'm living Groundhog's Day.  It's the same effing thing every day.  Yeah, until you're really documented in photos. 
[00:01:00]  Right.  You don't realize how mundane things are.  I sent the picture to my Twitter friends and they're gonna go,  Wait, you sent the picture you took yesterday.  No, it's today's picture that looks exactly like yesterday's picture,  which kind of proves to me that I'm living Groundhog's Day.  It's a new picture.  It's a nice Groundhog's Day.  I know people have a horrible life out there,  but it certainly is the same exact thing every day. 
[00:01:30]  He picks me up.  Good morning, GH.  And then he sits in his car and drives me here,  which is a nice luxury to have.  And then someone pointed out that his profile looks like an Accela train.  Oh, my God.  That is perfect.  And then I come in here.  I sit down.  I start reading papers.  And then a mere two to three minutes into reading papers,  I have to take one of the papers to the bathroom for about five or ten minutes.  Then I come out. 
[00:02:00]  I'm describing my morning real fast.  And the coffee is waiting for me that Kenny just made.  And I'm like, Oh, my God.  It's the same exact thing every effing day.  Every effing day.  Good morning.  Hey, it's Groundhog Day.  See, look.  There's the picture of Kenny.  Look.  Oh, we've got to pop the other one.  I'll pop the screen on.  Oh, no.  And I would love to give this guy credit.  Someone got a hold of me on Twitter and said,  Dude, his profile is an Accela train.  Oh, look at him.  Oh, God. 
[00:02:30]  That looks like a before picture for some kind of cosmetic surgery,  like by a chin.  Yeah, yeah.  Chin implants.  Chin implants.  Yeah, well.  How they, like, take maybe your nose and put your chin in it and put it in your chin.  Just something.  Well, Danny's searching for an Accela train to kind of do a little split.  Oh, there you go.  Look at this guy.  It does look like an Accela.  Sorry, I know it's visual.  No, we can do it because we can get a little more fancy on onaradio.com. 
[00:03:00]  We'll do a split screen for everybody.  Oh, yeah.  Go to the Opie and Anthony section or that takes you right there.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Rich Voss is in for Jimmy.  Jimmy played Miami last night.  I guess he'll be back.  He'll be back tomorrow, but we got Voss today, which is very good.  We haven't seen you in a while.  Yeah.  Rich.  Lucky him out in Florida.  Oh, my God.  This is a perfect time to leave New York, right?  I wonder what physical thing he's doing in that beautiful weather.  You took a picture of Rich also. 
[00:03:30]  Now, from your angle of the camera, you couldn't see what was on the computer that he was working on.  Well, you said that Rich looks like every Nazi's...  Every Nazi's nightmare.  Nightmare.  He looks like every Nazi propaganda poster I've ever seen in my life.  He had his little spectacles on.  Yeah.  His little spectacles.  His hat, which isn't the cool black Kango hat anymore, same shape, but now it's that felt grandpa hat.  And he had his spectacles on, and he's looking over this spreadsheet with just money figures on it. 
[00:04:00]  I'm like, you are just what united Nazi Germany.  That's true.  The only difference is I couldn't figure out what those numbers meant.  No, that's true.  And the real Jew could have.  Yeah, and somehow you turn thousands of dollars into nothing that you wound up getting.  It's unbelievable.  Even a quick glance that I took at it, it's like, I looked at the gross and then the net, and I was like, wow, you are a horrid businessman. 
[00:04:30]  No, I'm not.  No.  We cut the deal.  We cut the deal for 50% of the door of this club in Canada.  And I wanted to do it so I could take Bonnie to Canada.  They literally gave him half of the door of the club.  That's what he was paid.  They took the money.  It is Canada, though, Rich.  Come on.  You should have taken those guys for 110%.  They're all stupid and dumb up there.  You know that.  They're not that dumb.  Then all of a sudden, you know, it's coming closer today, and they go, you know what, we're going to do 25% now. 
[00:05:00]  Well, that's, you know, I didn't think they were hurting up in Canada as bad as we are.  Well, I guess they are.  How do they renegotiate a deal just by telling you, what is this, the mob you're working with the Canadian mafia?  Well, we're going to get half the show.  Why the tiny little spectacle?  Yes, you've got little spectacles that look like, it looks like those piles of spectacles you saw in Schindler's List.  And shoes and everything else.  Those spectacles would have fit perfectly in that pile. 
[00:05:30]  This is the spectacles from the guy from the Twilight Zone.  Oh, my God, look at it.  It looks like a pen holder.  Yeah.  Because this pair is easy to fit in my pocket, and it's small enough, big enough where people think that maybe this is me.  You know what I mean when it's in my pocket?  But when I, look at it, they just hang nice and.  They're on the tip of his nose, too.  Right.  And he's just like, let me look at my figures.  Well, see, only a Jew hater like you would come up with this. 
[00:06:00]  I am not a Jew.  I'm trying to keep you from perpetuating a certain stereotype.  It comes out of your mouth.  Someone's got to say this stereotype.  If you perpetuate it and no one says it, it's not really perpetuated.  It's like a tree falling in the forest.  I have a problem with your glasses because you're trying to live in this world where we're all young.  And you make yourself look really old with those things.  That's true.  And you, and I'll compliment you.  My grandpa wore those.  Santa Claus wore those.  For Rich's age, he does look good.  He takes care of himself and stuff.  But then you old yourself up with, like, your hat and your little spectacles. 
[00:06:30]  Okay, first I have the hat.  Okay, it's two degrees out.  Okay?  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, but that hat doesn't keep you warm.  Two degree weather, you got to get a hat that covers your ears.  Everyone knows that.  What are you wearing warm weather, the stovepipe hat like Lincoln?  Right.  Yeah, those dummies back then couldn't figure out to keep the ears warm.  Yeah.  Let me just have a hat that launches two feet above my head.  Our ancestors were stupid.  They had dumb hats. 
[00:07:00]  And because the earth was different, it was a lot colder back then.  How many people walked through doorways and knocked their hats off?  I bet if they had video cameras back then, there'd be huge montages of people with those dumb hats getting their hats knocked off walking through the doorways.  That would make a great YouTube video for 1860.  The America's Funniest Home Videos, they show that, they show, you know, a couple of people being whipped.  Well, it was back then, you know, things were more accepted.  What did you just put on your head?  This is what keeps me...  Oh, my God, Rick.  Oh, no. 
[00:07:30]  Now he's got earmuffs.  I don't even know what it's called.  I mean, they cover the ears, but they're not official earmuffs.  I can't put a hat...  Well, this morning I could put a hat on because I don't care about my hair.  Yeah.  But, you know, I don't have hair like you, like little white boy hair, where I could put a hat on and just shake it and it's back in place.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The straight hair always annoyed me because I'd have to walk, you know, the second a gust of wind hit it, you'd look like Medusa.  Yeah.  You'd get snakes growing out of your head.  I know, it's unbelievable. 
[00:08:00]  It's like a tumbleweed festival on my head.  So if I put a hat on, then it's like a high-low or whatever.  It looks like some bad sculpture.  Have you ever experienced frizz, Opie?  Oh, yeah.  Have you ever experienced it?  Look at my hair today.  Straight hair.  That's not good.  I think, once again, I used one of my girls' products in the shower.  Did you, like, leg shaving or...  Dude, all right.  Foot exfoliant cream, did you put that in instead of conditioner?  That's the lucky one because when his girl moved out, she took all the crazy stuff with her. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, ho!  You've got crazy stuff still in your house even though you don't have a regular?  I got, like, five girls' crap in my shower.  No, no, you know something?  That rules.  It's loaded with stuff.  Do they all have their little names on them?  No.  No, but, like...  Like they're at camp.  Some will be in there and just be like, what is that?  First of all...  Yeah, I use it myself and I have to spend an hour using every product like it's mine. 
[00:09:00]  Way to go, Einstein.  Now you just announced it to everybody.  Great.  No, you know something?  Vagisil is very important to male hygiene.  Yeah.  How do you guys...  No, Rich, really fast, just to bring you on board.  My girl...  It used to be shampoo, conditioner, and then they got really clever.  Shampoo and conditioner.  One bottle.  But these broads and there's stuff and it's in French and you have to try to figure out,  I think this is some kind of shampoo and then...  It's for every part of their body individually.  Right, and then you put it on your head and it looks like you were, like, washing with 
[00:09:30]  grease or something and you come in here.  Shampoo and conditioner, bar of soap.  That's it.  There you go.  That's the guy.  Oh, no.  Girls, it's everything.  Their toes have special toe soap.  Yeah.  And then they got, like, heel stuff.  Yeah.  Then there's a thing in there for the heel and then there's knee washer and thigh stuff  and then, of course, for the...  That area, there's all kinds of goods.  There's a sandblast.  That's like ground zero.  You know, there's all kinds of heavy machinery, things going on. 
[00:10:00]  And then up there's, like, yeah, exfoliating stuff and then for the face, there's all kinds  of creams and everything, elbows.  There's a whole bottle just for elbows.  How many you got, octopus?  You got two.  These are girls that are with you and this is what they want to do when they're done.  They just want to take...  They just want to...  They just want to clean off...  Clean off.  The bad memories.  They want to clean off.  It's an excuse for them to be in the fetal position in the corner of the shower.  No, I'm using all my products. 
[00:10:30]  Wiping off 15 years of shame.  I hear Anthony's going to make it easy for them and he's installing a car wash in the  back.  Just a car wash.  With a nice recliner.  All right.  Sit in the recliner.  How do you guys that are...  I'm not saying you're the wealthiest men in the world, but I'm like a pauper that lives  in a two-bedroom townhouse.  Shut up.  You do very well.  And we each have...  You're just jealous of us.  I understand that.  But you do very well.  My wife and I each have our own bathroom. 
[00:11:00]  Don't you guys have two bathrooms?  Oh, I had a bail.  I had a bail from the main bathroom.  Oh, yeah.  I got my own.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  I got a smaller...  And I get all the leftover products that she decides didn't work for her.  Wait, I'm counting.  Yeah.  Three.  Four.  Four.  Six.  Really?  Is that what grade your girl's in?  Seven.  I got...  I actually get two bathrooms.  Seven.  And she gets two.  I have seven bathrooms.  No way. 
[00:11:30]  But they're ridiculous.  I don't need seven bathrooms for that house.  You ever find...  I had a new one and just put it in the basement.  Really?  Yeah, I put a pump in there to pump all the stuff up.  Nice.  Did you ever find my duty?  No.  That's now officially your bathroom.  Once someone uses it once, it's their bathroom.  Wait, you have four?  I have four in New York City, yeah.  The house...  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah, but you know what?  I mean, New York City's just stupid.  I looked at places for over a year, and it's all about bathrooms.  I don't get it.  And I'm thinking, being a kid from Long Island, I'm like, man, if I knock out a couple of these 
[00:12:00]  bathrooms, I'll have a lot more room.  That's what I thought.  Why are they wasting freaking valuable room by putting all these extra bathrooms in?  Yeah.  I mean...  I was one of seven.  We had two bathrooms.  How bad...  Seven kids plus the parents.  So you're talking nine people using two bathrooms.  How bad do you have to go to the bathroom?  You can't walk an extra 10 feet.  I got bathrooms like Starbucks.  They're just like...  No, but Anthony doesn't want the bathrooms either.  He understands how this works. 
[00:12:30]  But for some reason, these pompous, these pretentious asses that live in Manhattan, everyone  has to have their own bathroom.  I didn't have a house built to my own spec, so I moved in.  And I was like, what?  Could you imagine growing up having every room having their own bathroom?  That's insane.  It would have been great.  I had to sit there at the door.  Joe!  Right.  Come on, shut up.  But in Manhattan, they insist on this.  They insist.  Every room has to have its own bathroom.  It's stupid. 
[00:13:00]  You know what me and my brother used to do?  Because we only had one bathroom growing up forever.  Forever.  And my sister used to be so embarrassed at going to the bathroom, you know, number deuce,  because it would make a certain sound as if you dropped a little rock into a bucket  of water.  So we would make sure everything was quiet, and we'd put our ears against the door, and  every time we heard it, we'd just start going, plop, plop, plop.  And she would get so upset at us yelling, plop, plop, through the door. 
[00:13:30]  It's good to know you tortured your sister, because we tortured ours as well.  Dude, ridiculous.  Poor Donnie.  You just have to.  Poor Donnie.  Yeah.  Hey, E-Rock has flat hair today, according to Sam.  What happened?  Thanks to Angela's hair products.  So where's E-Rock?  Oh, Jesus.  I'm telling you.  I mean, they got to, like, label this stuff easier for us.  What is it?  Shampoo and garlic butter saw?  E-Rock, what did you use on your hair today?  I don't know, but it was, uh...  Oh, my God.  It really is greasy flat. 
[00:14:00]  Ew, look at the front.  It's just totally greasy.  Who cut your bangs?  An epileptic?  Well, we'll wait until the hat comes off.  What did you use on that?  I'm not exactly sure, because I ran out of my shampoo, but...  You reach for the girl's stuff, and you just assume it's shampoo, and it's like...  It was a white bottle with black lettering, so I figured, oh, that looks like shampoo.  And, uh...  It looks like a Roman helmet.  Yeah, it does.  It took a while to get out.  Dude, it's shiny greasy. 
[00:14:30]  Look how shiny greasy it is.  That really is something.  Well, hopefully it was Nair.  That would be hilarious.  You have the worst crew of hair in this building.  If you look around, there's not really a good hairdo around here.  I don't know if that's a Roman...  Roman war.  Yeah.  Or is that Greek?  I don't know.  Who knows?  It looks like...  All right.  You have 300 hair.  We've got to take a break.  We've got your town body.  That's a pretty good break right there. 
[00:15:00]  Ed in California.  We're going to get to you next, okay?  No worries.  All right.  Ed in California.  We'll start the phone calls today.  877-212-O-N-A.  We've got Rich Voss in today, and we've got some Obama stuff.  Obama.  It begins today.  The honeymoon's over.  Is it?  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Was there ever a honeymoon?  There was a honeymoon.  Everyone was leaving this guy alone, but...  All I know is what happens on a honeymoon, and I firmly expect that to happen in my near future.  So, I don't think it's over yet. 
[00:15:30]  I think I'm coming out in a nightie, out from the bathroom, and he's going to tap the bed next to him, and I'm getting in and getting it.  You look up at an Angela Davis blacklight poster.  Oh, yeah.  That poster that was hanging over the bed in The Shining.  Yeah.  He took the oath again.  We're going to get into that.  Yeah, boy.  He's closing...  Make sure.  I'm the president, goddammit.  He didn't want to...  He's closing Guantanamo.  We'll get into that.  Yes, I'm mad.  He's going to, I think, take all the people that are at Guantanamo as prisoners and invite him to the White House for dinner and apologies. 
[00:16:00]  And the dude that forgot to do his taxes.  That's a great story.  Oh, yeah.  What's he supposed to be confirmed for?  Oh, yeah.  Treasury secretary.  So...  What a cluster F.  You know, business as usual in Washington.  Look at this.  That's my angle.  Let's change America.  All right?  We're waiting.  That's my angle on the whole thing.  Business as usual.  Well, the players just are a little different.  I'm more upset that he's a lefty than the fact that he's a black man, by the way. 
[00:16:30]  Really?  I never trusted...  Those damn lefties.  I never trusted the lefties when I was growing up.  The lazy lefties.  I never trusted those mother effers.  There was a reason why they were killed when, back in the day...  Hey, the L word.  Oh, the L word.  Call it the L word.  Sorry to all you lefties out there, but I don't trust you whatsoever.  It was so hard to cover you in sports.  I'm like, you're going the wrong way.  It's Southpaw.  Right?  Wait.  What are you talking about?  Hold on.  We'll get into it.  And the picture of Rich Voss, the picture of Kenny, that looks like the picture of Kenny 
[00:17:00]  yesterday.  Go to OP Radio on Twitter and join me.  Haters, stay away.  I have no room for you guys.  Oh, there you go.  Just invited tons of haters.  I, by the way, got, I think, 1,000, over 1,000 requests now for friends.  For Facebook, right?  I hate doing it, though.  Just do it.  Click, click, click.  I know.  Just do it. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, I know.  No, I will.  That's why I tell everybody.  You're what on Facebook?  Because we're...  Anthony Cumia.  We're covering everything, finally.  We got the Pal Talk.  We got the Facebook.  We got the MySpace.  I'm doing Twitter because it's the easiest thing to do.  I picked the easiest one.  I'll pop another pick up and a little caption.  All right.  More with Rich Voss.  Stay there.  OP and Anthony.  Rich Voss.  You. 
[00:18:00]  Good morning.  877-212-ON-A.  Oh, I promised we'd go to Ed.  What's going on, Ed?  Not much.  I'm just glad that phony bitch, Caroline Kennedy, turns out she's more interested in furthering  Ted's breakdancing career than career in the Senate.  I think it might be another Obama miracle.  She was a babbling...  Punching out.  Grab the tooth.  It's a local thing, probably, but obviously it's a Kennedy, so I think this would interest 
[00:18:30]  some people.  Man, she does not have the charisma of her father, her mother, her brother, her uncle,  her other uncle.  She better be good at something.  She stinks.  She ain't a Kennedy as far as that charisma and public speaking goes.  When John John talked, people listened, although it was mostly women, like, getting moist.  Apparently, aside from his wife, I thought, shut up, I'm trying to fly. 
[00:19:00]  You think the guy had the perfect life, and, you know, he picked the wrong one.  He picked the bitch of a woman, if you've read anything about her.  It's a little hazy up here.  Could you be quiet?  I'm trying to concentrate.  Really?  I'm playing with a broken leg.  Yeah, where's Sully when I need him?  Yeah.  Poor Sully.  Not poor Sully.  Anyway, Carolyn Kennedy, I think the party itself, like, kind of pushed her.  Like, hey, Hillary's gone. 
[00:19:30]  This is your job.  You're a Kennedy.  Yeah.  You are a Kennedy.  They just wanted the name in there.  And there's a reason she's been out of the spotlight pretty much her entire life.  She sucks.  She can't speak.  You've got to be able to speak if you go into politics.  I heard something on the winds on the way in, and wow.  Yeah, I got that for you.  Oh, you got that?  Oh, that's the only reason we took that call.  She's trying to explain why it's a good time for her to jump into politics.  Right, right.  Oof.  What an explanation.  Huh?  What?  What'd you say?  What other business can you just jump into? 
[00:20:00]  You know what?  Yeah, that's another thing.  Yeah, right.  You know what?  I want to be a politician.  And then some people were saying, well, you know, we were really looking for somebody  that has a few years' experience in a lower office already.  And they were blurting out all these qualifications that it would take that she doesn't have.  And I was like, Hillary was Bill Clinton's wife.  That was it.  What qualifications?  She didn't run for public office.  She didn't have any prior public office in her background. 
[00:20:30]  She was around politics her whole life, way more than Carolyn Kennedy, though.  A councilwoman in Fishkill probably has more.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, but I mean, you know, saying that Kennedy wasn't around politics her whole life, you  know, she was too.  You know, a couple of them.  You know what?  There's people that have been around comedians their whole life.  They can't get on stage and do it.  You know, one's in your studio right now.  Me.  But here's, you know.  I was going to jump for that, and then I figured I'd cut you to cut you slack. 
[00:21:00]  You're actually really good on the stage.  Thank you.  If you're, you know, you suck on the radio, but you're really good on the stage.  I don't stink on the radio.  I got years.  I almost slipped.  I got years of proof.  I got years of stench.  I got years of stench.  I'm messing with you.  You wouldn't be here if we thought you sucked.  Like, and, and, and.  We never invited back.  Yeah, just do a little, do a little thinking about who comes back and who doesn't.  If you're, if you're invited in here, trust me, as much as we want to beat you up live 
[00:21:30]  on the air and stuff.  Some comedians are Chuck from Happy Days.  One season and you're gone.  Where'd he go?  I don't know, but Fonzie's a pisser, ain't he?  Jack Bauer's daughter.  Yeah.  Listen, so Carolyn Kennedy, thumbs up from Travis.  Please don't mention 24 ever again.  I know.  IQ, coincidentally enough, dummy.  So Carolyn Kennedy has decided that she's not going to be the senator of New York, but 
[00:22:00]  let me tell you what's been going on here.  Governor Patterson, he's not stupid.  He was not going to allow that to happen.  Yeah.  So now she's bowing out before that embarrassment where Governor Patterson goes, eh, you're not  qualified.  He said something like, I'm just not seeing you as a senator.  Well, here's Carolyn Kennedy.  We were looking for like a JFK moment, an FDR moment, Anthony, if I dare say. 
[00:22:30]  The end of the decad, we will go to the boat, put a man on the moon, and do those other things.  Right.  What were the other things?  Not as important as putting a man on the moon, apparently.  No.  The end of the decad.  Decad.  Instead of getting some of that great stuff, we got this.  You know, I think really this is sort of a unique moment both in our, you know, in our  country's history and in, you know, my own life.  And, you know, we are facing, you know, unbelievable challenges, our economy, you know, health care. 
[00:23:00]  You know.  People are losing their jobs here in New York, obviously.  And so, you know, and for me, I've grown up here.  I've lived here all my life.  I love New York.  And, you know, and going into politics is something that people have asked me about forever.  She stammers worse than I.  She's horrible.  She stinks.  Sounds like an assistant coach for a high school, like, baseball team or something. 
[00:23:30]  You know.  Can you hit the bell every time she says, you know, because I need a count.  It's been I'm moron.  Hit that bell every time you hear her, you know.  I want to play this clip again.  I think there's ten of them in there.  You know, I think really this is sort of a unique moment both in our, you know, in our country's history and in, you know, my own life.  And, you know, we are facing, you know, unbelievable challenges, our economy, you know, health care.  People are losing their jobs here in New York, obviously. 
[00:24:00]  And so, you know, and for me, I've grown up here.  I've lived here all my life.  I love New York.  And, you know, and going into politics is something that people have asked me about forever.  Forever.  Ever.  You hear the ever?  Forever.  Forever.  You know.  Jeez.  Thanks.  Wow.  God, we're left with her.  Are you kidding me?  Last of the line.  You had John John.  That's it.  You had JFK.  You had all of them. 
[00:24:30]  That's it.  The soil is out of nutrients.  She is a dust bowl.  You've got to rest that field for a decade.  Yeah.  You've got to kind of rotate the crop.  Jeez, thanks.  That's really good.  And then there's a second clip here.  If there's more, you know, let's hit that bell for us so we don't have to hear this twice.  Of course.  You know, I am an unconventional choice.  I understand that.  I haven't pursued the traditional path.  But I think that in our public life today, you know, we're starting to see that there are many ways into public life and public service. 
[00:25:00]  And it's not as, you know, all our institutions are less hierarchical than they used to be.  Hierarchical.  And so, you know, I think that, you know, I bring, you know, my life experience to this.  And, you know, that includes, you know, being a mother.  You know, I understand sort of those choices that women make. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, my God.  Eric Douglas of Kennedy's.  He's an idiot.  But, you know, what a crutch that is.  Wow.  Seventeen you knows in two clips that were barely over a minute.  Seventeen you knows.  Seventeen you knows.  What do you know?  Wow.  Yeah, so that's done.  You know.  You know.  Here's the thing.  Right, Rich?  Here's the thing.  What I'm saying.  Number one, first of all.  But what happens to us?  And there's not a second of all, you know. 
[00:26:00]  Wait.  That's the one that, what do you call it, Neil Diamond wrote that song about, isn't it?  Sweet Caroline.  Mm-hmm.  Sweet Caroline, you know.  Good times never seemed, you know, so good, you know.  She was like seven.  Yeah.  I know.  Sweet Caroline.  I know.  We did that bit.  That was.  And apparently her vocabulary got no better.  You know.  You know.  I know the struggle.  All right.  Well, there you go.  So that's done.  Thank God. 
[00:26:30]  Hey, what's up with Obama taking the oath the second time?  I guess they, boy, they are not taking any chances with this one.  Any opportunity that anyone could think of to throw this guy out of office.  Dude.  So they just, yeah, it's a technicality, this wearing in.  The Constitution says that at noon on the 20th of January, you are the president, regardless  if you take an oath or not.  Mm-hmm.  It's pretty much just a thing.  I think it's for him, though, because that is such a huge moment.  The whole world's watching it, and it's a mess up there. 
[00:27:00]  So I think he wants a nice, clean version of that.  Steve from Bayshore.  I can't even read it, but.  Really?  Bravo.  You know.  You know.  You know.  You know.  And I think New York State needs me.  You know.  Didn't that guy used to say that all the time?  Yeah.  Don't you know.  Don't you know.  I don't know who that was back when I was a little kid in the 40s.  But he wasn't the one that messed up when they were doing it? 
[00:27:30]  Now they're switching blame to the.  Not switching.  They said Roberts all along.  But we jumped out and said, look, Obama, you know, messed up a bit there.  Well, Obama jumped the gun by starting it before Roberts finished the line he was supposed  to, you know.  Yeah.  Line.  Yeah.  And what did I say about Biden?  What did I say?  That he's going to be a problem.  Because this guy, this Biden, wants the spotlight so bad, he pretty much thought that everybody 
[00:28:00]  was there for him.  It's about him.  Did you see him waving?  He walked the entire parade route, right?  Yeah.  And he's waving like, look, man.  Yeah.  Thank you for coming out to see no secret service.  Nothing.  They don't give a crap about everything, crowd surfing up Pennsylvania, right?  Because they're not dumb down there in Washington.  They knew no way could you have two black guys.  You can't have a black president and a black vice president.  And they also said, no way could you have a black president and a woman or no way you  can't have a black president and a young dude. 
[00:28:30]  So they went black president, old white dude to just kind of make it a little comfortable  for some of us.  Yeah.  Not all.  I understand that.  And Biden is just such the odd man out.  He thinks it's all about him, though.  You're absolutely right.  And he made a joke and Obama's face was like, whoa, Joe, slow down a little bit.  Was he joking about it?  Do we have that clip?  We better have that clip.  It wasn't how do you babysit Velcro joke.  No?  Okay.  Oof.  Not the tree one.  It wasn't how did, how many, something about tarring a roof. 
[00:29:00]  No?  No, no.  Nothing like that, Aunt Jesus.  The joke didn't end with sticking anyone to a wall, did it?  Okay.  I guess, you know, if we had someone actually producing the show, we'd have the clip in front  of us right now.  Because it was one of the big stories yesterday.  But why, why would we have it?  No, they'll not.  Oh, okay.  Very good.  But basically, they, he had to swear in some people.  Yeah.  And Obama, they're at some kind of press conference. 
[00:29:30]  And Obama goes, uh, all right, Joe, if you will, why don't you swear those people in or  whatever?  And he, and Joe's like, I thought I did that already.  And Obama's like, well, you did the one group, but you have to do the second group.  And then he made a joke like, oh, well, my, I guess my mind, my, what, my mind's not  as good as Roberts?  My memory isn't as good as, uh, Justice Roberts.  Right.  And it got a, and it got an awkward chuckle and Obama's looking at him like, what the  hell?  Shut up there.  Mark my word.  All right.  This is the beginning. 
[00:30:00]  Mark my word.  Watch this situation very closely.  This Biden, I know a lot of guys like him, but he is all about him.  He is a me, me, me bird.  Yeah, yeah.  He's always been.  He, uh, you know, he wanted to, obviously he wanted to be president and now he's second fiddle,  but he's jumping around like, you know, all right, you got this guy.  Right.  But you know, look at me.  Right.  He's the attention seeker.  I'm a white guy.  Pay attention to me.  He's that one relative we all have.  Oh, the attention.  Looking for a little more attention than everyone else.  And they should really deserve to get. 
[00:30:30]  Right.  Exactly.  Of course.  So we don't have the clip, I guess.  No.  It's coming in.  It's coming in.  That's good.  Well, I have it while we're talking about it.  Uh, Jesus.  Oh, it was, uh, it was, uh, recorded.  I didn't catch that part.  Huh?  Yeah, yeah.  It was.  Camera people in there.  Yeah, it was one of the big, you know, things happening yesterday in Washington.  This isn't an obscure thing that I found on my own.  Just turn on the TV.  It's everywhere.  So get it for us.  How long do they, uh, videotape or go into the White House and, you know, do a play-by-play 
[00:31:00]  of what the president is doing now?  How long, you know what I mean?  Like.  Yeah, when will this end?  Because you're right.  Because, uh, I couldn't, I couldn't watch the news yesterday.  I tried, I watched a little bit of it, but it was pretty much just a retrospective of  the day before.  Well, let's look back.  Yeah.  On yesterday.  What?  I saw yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  I don't want to see it again.  Edwin.  It's like watching the towers go down.  I don't want to see it anymore. 
[00:31:30]  I think.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Edwin.  Edwin, don't you know?  You know.  Thank you to, uh, radio guy in Brooklyn.  Okay, here's the old thing.  I want to know why they did this.  I, I, I, I didn't follow this, uh, story yesterday as closely.  I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear.  I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear.  That I will faithfully execute the office of the president of the United States.  That I will faithfully execute the office of the president of the United States.  And will, to the best of my duty.  And will, to the best of my duty.  Preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. 
[00:32:00]  Preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.  And that will be done.  So, I will be done.  Congratulations again.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  So, we're done.  And it's the coolest.  There's 12 more balls.  And.  What was that line?  I didn't hear that.  I already heard.  Dirty.  I heard balls.  You said, uh, and for the crew or the pool list, there are 12 more balls.  Someone's trying to say they're going to do it all over again.  There were only six guys in the room? 
[00:32:30]  It was a very small crowd, right?  It was in the White House.  That one.  I heard it.  It was like a.  Yeah.  It was like a callback for the swearing in.  It's easy to divide by two.  That's why I was able to say it so fast.  Oh.  My math skills stink.  Oh, here it is.  Uh, Brian in New York.  Brian.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  What's up, buddy?  Yeah, Joe Biden's jumping around like Giuliani's kid at his swearing in.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:33:00]  I'm glad someone else noticed that.  Because when you were watching the festivities, that Biden was working that whole platform up there.  And he's winking and he's kissing and he's hugging.  And he's like, ta-ta.  Just work in the room.  But it's not about you.  He must have just been looking ahead going, good.  I should be the guy walking up there.  Yeah, right.  I should be up there.  He's like the center trying to, you know, outdo the quarterback.  Yeah, yeah.  Nobody cares about you.  Just sit down.  Nobody cares.  Shut it.  There's no Biden plates.  You want publicity, you gotta, uh, you gotta shoot someone in the face, apparently, like, uh, Cheney did. 
[00:33:30]  You know.  Go hunting.  Because no one cared what Cheney was doing.  Well, Nick and PA, I don't have time to get to him.  He says, maybe Biden is trying to be like Cheney and have power over Obama.  Yeah, everyone said Cheney was pretty much the mastermind behind the Bush administration.  But I don't believe that.  Well, Biden's just happy to be there.  You know.  Here's what Biden did yesterday.  Joe, do you want to administer the oath?  Am I doing this again?  For the senior staff.  For the senior staff.  All right. 
[00:34:00]  Oh.  Number seven members of Artic.  My memory is not as good as Justice Roberts.  Justice Roberts.  Does anyone have to know Isaac?  Obama.  Oh, I'm Isaac.  Obama gave a look like, oh, boy, he's going to be a problem.  Yeah.  The honeymoon's over between those two, I'm thinking.  They don't seem like they legitimately like each other.  Oh, yeah.  Obama needed them.  Like Bush and Cheney seem like, eh, you know, they got common interests.  Oil. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Money.  Which money, you know, southern money, crap like that.  But, you know, not bully me.  I'm not one of these stupid liberals.  Let's blow the oil, man.  Whatever.  You know, your family made a fortune in oil.  God bless you.  Have fun.  But, you know, they did have a lot in common.  These two?  Worlds apart.  I think so.  You know, Obama obviously needed an old white guy, and he fell.  Yeah.  I can't think of anyone else he could have picked.  Because he really needed an old white guy.  Yeah.  Right?  Strom Thurmond. 
[00:35:00]  He was dead.  I don't know.  That would have been a...  Yeah, yeah.  I was saying that would have made a nice pairing, too.  Make a sitcom out of that one.  And thank God you live on Long Island, because after the break, there's a racist Facebook page out there.  We're getting some New Jersey worker in trouble.  Oh, really?  We'll get into that.  And speaking of racist stuff, we've got an update on the Hitler, the Hitler boy.  Little Hitler.  Little Hitler update.  He is adorable.  What a cute little kid.  Did you see him? 
[00:35:30]  I love him.  I want to tussle his little hair.  I want to get Rich Voss's angle on this whole thing after the break.  Little Hitler?  How could Rich Voss love Hitler?  Little Hitler?  He's adorable.  I love how he waves to his friends.  Yeah.  Wow.  And more Obama stuff, of course.  Just opening the White House to the average Joe yesterday.  What is he?  Making all sorts of statements in his first day.  And then you've got...  I don't get this one.  Boys give testimony for football campaign. 
[00:36:00]  Hazing.  We've got another one of those hazing stories.  And I think it's the same high school that happened.  No, not the pine cone one.  With the pine cones?  I think.  I'm not positive.  Maybe someone can help me out on this.  Danny's shaking his head now.  It's a different one?  Because I think that high school also had a little problem recently, too.  Yeah.  No, this was a football camp in New Mexico.  Okay.  The alleged instrument was a broomstick.  Danny likes keeping track of these stories.  The sexy stories he calls them.  Keep it hot so you don't have to.  877-212-0&A.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, we're such a dick. 
[00:36:30]  Good morning.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  Sometimes you just gotta, you know, throw the ballast over the side, my friend.  Ixnay.  Oh, I'm ixnaying.  It's just, you know.  For the people that think we're inside at times, all this stuff makes its way to the radio eventually.  It's like Lost.  Because I understand how that is, where you're like, what the hell?  Why don't you just tell us?  In time, my friend.  In time.  It gets tied up in the end.  Yeah.  I won't ruin it for people that have DVR'd, but Lost at a two-hour premiere last night. 
[00:37:00]  Are they still Lost?  Apparently, yeah, yeah.  But they do flashbacks and flash forwards.  So they show them like three years later.  And they show them three years earlier prior to the crash and everything.  And it was a two-hour, with a one-hour kind of a recap in the beginning.  Really, really good.  A lot of stuff.  Like, I was hoping there would be a lot of stuff and not a lot of, like, just filler.  Yeah.  But they loaded the show up with a lot of really cool new storyline stuff. 
[00:37:30]  And I'm digging it.  I missed the boat on that one.  I'm kind of bummed.  Do you think the final episode is going to be called Found?  Found.  Your mic isn't on now, Rich.  Rich isn't.  What happened, Rich?  What are you saying there, buddy?  Well, you're saying there's new storylines.  There's still 80 they have to tie together from last year.  I'm not saying there aren't a few loose ends.  Loose ends?  A few, my God. 
[00:38:00]  A few loose ends.  But, no, every new thing that happens kind of gives a little bit of an answer to the old one.  Although there is a time, not so much time travel.  That always sounds so silly and everything.  But, you know, time displacement thing going on that refutes a lot of the theories that were in a little movie called Back to the Future.  So I was watching that with an interest.  Just going, hmm, that's interesting.  But a good show.  Great premiere. 
[00:38:30]  And, yeah, looking forward to the next one.  Well, see, these shows, we usually get them all on box sets.  Okay, so I've had, I've watched every season of 24.  But people ruin it.  People ruin it for us on, see, I've got to watch it the second it happens if I'm really interested in the show.  Because I'll look down at Pal Talk or an email or something like that and people go, hey, did you hear blah, blah, blah is dead?  And you're like, thank you.  You know what?  Just ruin that for me.  You're not smart.  I'm into a show right now and I'm digging it. 
[00:39:00]  Not going to tell you which one it is.  But I'll watch Lost.  Because I'm watching the box set.  Oh, yeah?  It's a great show.  And it could be ruined for me.  That's why I'm not going to mention what the show is.  Queer as folk.  I know.  You told me.  Ooh.  Ooh.  So right now on the show I'm watching, Lou and Mary just meet.  Right.  That makes sense.  But I watch them on box sets. 
[00:39:30]  Like, I'm watching 24 this season.  And why I don't like it, like when Bonnie was in Canada, I had the sixth season and I got  to watch like four in a row at night.  So, you know, four.  Four episodes?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Four seasons.  No, four seasons.  Stupid.  Well, it's just an hour, right?  Frankie Valli.  So today.  Well, so, like one episode of any of these shows, I'm slobbering, isn't really enough?  Don't you think?  Oh, yeah.  When you're able to sit down and watch a box set like that, you don't just watch one episode 
[00:40:00]  and go away.  Yeah.  Three or four.  You sit there for hours.  The box set is definitely ruining your viewing experience.  Because when you're into a show, you're right.  When you see one, you're like, I got to wait a whole week?  What?  What are you, nuts?  Here's what I do.  In this day and age?  Hell no.  Here's what I do, though.  Like last night, I DVR'd, lost the whole thing, and didn't start watching it until  I knew I could fast forward through every commercial.  That's smart.  So I watched Goddamn Superbad.  It's so goddamn funny. 
[00:40:30]  It gets better and better every time you watch it, right?  I just watched it for the second time, and I hadn't seen it probably since it came out.  I was laughing my ass off last night.  There is some genuinely funny-ass parts in that movie.  I was just, you know, alone and laughing like a retard in my house.  I never saw it.  I never saw Superbad?  No.  Any of those.  You do have to have a certain type of sense of humor.  Because I know people that have been like, oh, the movie sucked.  Oh, who's saying that?  There are people that say that.  I don't know them, but they email or say something. 
[00:41:00]  But it's one of those movies that you have to have kind of one of those, you know, growing  up and like you'd watch Animal House and laugh your ass off, and some people would be  like, Caddyshack is the same thing.  This was that type of movie, where some people just aren't going to get it, but hysterical,  man.  But if you think Caddyshack is not funny, there's something wrong with you.  Then I don't want to have any interaction with you whatsoever.  When he turned that old couple around, just thumbs up. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, right?  This way.  I know.  It's just...  I mean, the ending was very disappointing, but who cares?  They had to end it.  It was the journey, not the destination.  Yeah, back then they just ended movies, like especially comedies.  They had no way to really get out of a comedy that was a lot of slapstick and stuff, so they  just kind of ended them.  I'm raising my hand, Anthony.  Yes, Mr. Hughes?  Because you're quite brilliant when it comes to these type of things, and we think alike.  Worst ending to a comedy ever.  And let's not talk about comedies that are mediocre. 
[00:42:00]  We're talking those over-the-top, holy crap comedies.  I will tell you, and you will know it, yes.  I know we're on the same page.  Wait, shoot.  Downfall.  We will write our answers down, my friend.  All right.  Do we have any game show music?  I need a pen.  This will prove that it and I think alike.  I have no doubt.  Do you want to bet, Rich?  No.  That we'll write down the same answer?  To a comedy.  The worst ending to a comedy.  Comedy ever.  And we're not talking about comedies that suck. 
[00:42:30]  We're talking about a comedy that most people will go, wow, that was a really good movie.  Thank you.  Watch how Ian and I work when we feel like working together.  Nice.  For the match.  Mm-hmm.  It's so exciting.  I hope I match.  You can play along at home, too.  I scribbled.  We'll see how many people are going to get the match.  All right.  First, we're going to go to Charles Nelson Anthony.  Oh, wow. 
[00:43:00]  We're looking for the worst ending to a really good comedy.  Worst ending to a really good comedy.  The movie was funny.  Mm-hmm.  A lot of laughs.  Mm-hmm.  Very irreverent.  And then the ending came and just, it was nothing.  It was a hard ending.  And we'll show Rich at the same time.  Ready?  Oh, my goodness.  I knew it.  I didn't even have to, like.  Yes.  Really?  I didn't see it. 
[00:43:30]  Yes.  Blazing Saddles.  Blazing Saddles.  Worst ending to a really good comedy ever.  Maybe someone out there will disagree.  Maybe this is open for a little bit of a discussion.  They had no ending.  The movie ends in a Hollywood cafeteria.  Yeah.  Cafeteria.  Yeah.  Cafeteria.  Right.  That Long Island accent's coming back, man.  How many R's are there in Cafeteria?  It's almost Chicago, too.  I think I've got to go on.  Hey, I've got to go to the Cafeteria.  I think I've got to hit the road and do radio in another town for a while.  Because that Long Island accent, which is the worst in America, is starting to creep 
[00:44:00]  back.  It's creeping in.  What did you think of Pineapple Express?  Did you laugh at that?  I'm embarrassed to say I've never seen it.  Didn't say it.  I'm waiting for it to be on demand.  And for some reason, they will not put it on demand for me.  I don't go to the movies.  Yeah.  No.  You wait.  Why would I?  Well, we went to see Milk.  Did you?  I saw Milk.  I saw Milk.  What did you think?  I had two orgasms.  No, I thought it was.  Here's the thing.  I thought it was a really good movie.  It was a good movie.  The gay stuff.  Look, I'm in a little bit with the gay thing. 
[00:44:30]  But only that part.  Look, I'm open-minded enough to go, all right, I can deal a little bit.  I'm not 12 anymore, 14, 15 anymore.  But it gets a little rough in that movie, man.  I think Sean Penn a little overacted in that.  Oh, really?  A little dated too much.  You know what I mean?  Are you kidding me?  When they showed the real guy at the end of the movie, he played the part perfectly. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Although Sean Penn didn't want to go all in with the brown, yellow teeth like the real  guy had.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  He had teeth like he was eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  He probably wasn't eating that.  You'd think he'd have pearly whites.  It looked like he was eating some bad, if you know what I mean.  You'd think he'd have the whitest teeth I'd ever come across.  Did you see Doubt?  No, I want to see that.  I want to see that. 
[00:45:30]  Milk was all right.  I thought it was okay.  And did you notice, we'll say it again because the movie's pretty hot and it's up for some  Oscars.  Did you notice that Sean Penn made some kind of deal like, look, I'll give you one heavy  man-on-man kiss scene, but that's it?  Because then every time he kissed his lover, the rest of the movie, there was a shadow in  between the lips and stuff.  So you just had to imagine, okay, they're doing their thing right there.  But they wanted to show you.  It was from behind.  They wanted to show you at first so you could just know that that's what they were doing 
[00:46:00]  in the shadowy scene.  I'm sure there was a negotiation that went on with Sean Penn's people and the movie  people.  Like, look, he'll give you one really good one, but don't expect anything else.  Don't expect any broke-back mountain moments from Sean Penn.  Spit scenes.  You got it.  It's not only just one take.  You know, he might have only did a, you know.  That was a one-take kiss.  You think so?  That's perfect.  They probably set up 20 cameras like, look, one of these angles will work.  I'm doing this once and once only. 
[00:46:30]  That would be a good contest here.  Not gay guys, but they have to come in and two guys have to make out and see the best  make out with two guys that aren't gay.  All right.  When the Rich Voss show is on the air, you can do that.  Why does it make you uncomfortable?  Let's slow down a little bit.  Gay or funny?  Let's slow down a little bit.  What?  You think Rich is on to something?  Maybe.  I mean, first of all, we have to get an amazing prize, like cold, hard cash, and tell the  guys around here, look, you're doing this for the money. 
[00:47:00]  Is it like one of those?  We're making believe we're filming a scene for a movie.  One of those old-time kissing contests where you have to keep kissing, and then the last  people that are left, so you get a room full of what, guys?  And they have to keep kissing, and the last couple left wins the cash.  And we have, I mean, not just, I mean, we've got to have, like, Barry guys like Steve.  You've got to have just...  Twinks.  Yeah, just twinks.  You know, bottoms, tops.  I know Sam's in, that's obvious, but we need one more guy around here, and I don't think 
[00:47:30]  we're going to find it.  No, we can make it even more legit.  We get the scene from Milk.  So now they're just reenacting the famous scene from Milk that's going to be up for some  Academy Awards.  You know what, though?  There's a monkey wrench thrown into the whole thing.  Yeah?  We can't discriminate contests based on sexual preference.  And if two gay guys come up, winner.  They could just sit there and start making out.  I'm talking just our staff.  Like I said, two gay guys.  Steve, have you heard the show?  And?  It couldn't be any gayer. 
[00:48:00]  All right, well, there you go.  So Blazing Saddles, where were we?  Comedies.  Super bad.  Yeah, yeah.  Talk about that.  And then Lost.  Lost.  I DVR'd it, so no commercials.  I like that.  I hate overshooting the runway, though.  I'm so bad at that.  I know some people, man, that I got to give it up to, like, my ex.  She could nail that friggin' show.  Just on fourth gear.  Fourth gear with fast forward on the remote.  And then, bam, stop it right when the show starts. 
[00:48:30]  I'm like, hey, that's a familiar character.  And it's halfway through the scene until the next commercial.  And I stop it, rewind.  It takes me a while.  I should just sit through the commercials.  You nailed it.  My girl does the same thing.  It stops on a dime.  It's a chick thing.  And I'm like...  They're able to do that.  And then she laughs at me as I'm trying to do the same thing.  And they go, give me the remote.  Right, yeah.  They get frustrated.  And you give it to them, and you're emasculated.  Yeah.  It's like, I can't hit the mark on this.  And then you hit it, and you go, that was a good one.  Like you're retarded, and you just did a math problem. 
[00:49:00]  Hey, Steve from Chicago.  You'd rather do that contest with guys rather than girls?  No.  We were just kind of having a little silly fun there.  Relax.  And girls will just kiss each other anyway.  It's not like they don't even need prizes.  And that's icky, right, Ann?  Yeah.  It's so disgusting seeing girls kiss.  Especially hot, young, nubile girls making out and touching each other.  But boobies that don't move when they're doing jumping jacks.  Oh, stop talking about it.  I'm getting nauseous.  Who wants two youthful, hot chicks kissing? 
[00:49:30]  Oh, maybe an ass grab.  Right.  When you can get two middle-aged guys going at it.  Right.  Come on.  How funny would I be to see the guys in here making them?  Oh, did you see the guy collecting his money with Whisker Burn?  Like his face is all red from Whisker Burn?  That would be great.  I would be in, if we call it the Rich Voss bit.  We're doing the Rich Voss bit today.  And I'm just an observer.  You've got to give it out.  Yeah, that's an out for us.  Get out.  The Rich Voss bit.  Speaking of the Rich Voss bit, Danny, are we doing the Rich Voss bit today? 
[00:50:00]  We should do that.  Get some celebrities.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, Rich Voss is just, we've got to do your celebrity bit today.  I'll knock him out.  I've been knocking him out every time.  Maybe get some people in the news today.  We'll do people in the news with Rich Voss.  New Jim Carrey movie, I Love You, Philip Morris.  Apparently, he's kissing Ewan McGregor.  Ewan, oh yeah?  Yeah.  Really?  Some big, apparently, this was all the talk of Sundance. 
[00:50:30]  He's been running around telling everybody how delicious the kisses were.  Is that like the, yeah, that's him.  Oh, he's so wacky.  Is that like the whole box office draw thing now?  Just get guys up there to start making out?  That's what gives you an Oscar.  It's going to give you that Oscar or at least get your film, like, really out there, distributed,  making some money?  Yeah.  Get some buzz on it?  By the way, I got my ear to the O&A community and they're like, wow.  Your ear?  Ear.  Are you in a team?  My ear. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, your ear.  Okay.  Yeah, the show's a bit gay.  We've got to, like, get some hotness back into this somehow.  Some goyles.  Somehow.  James.  I blame the lawyers, though, because what happened was the lawyers took the naked chick away  from us.  Yes.  The naked chick.  We could do some fine stuff with naked chicks on this radio show.  So then we went, well, all right, we'll do naked guys then.  I don't know what happened.  Apparently, that's fine, and I don't get that anymore.  Yeah.  What's going on with the lawyers that they allow, you know, naked guy, guy on guy stuff  and not girl on girl stuff? 
[00:51:30]  Wait, they would let a naked guy, because, you know, that's what upsets me, because when  you're watching a movie, you'll never see the whole guy naked, but you'll see the girl.  Yeah, it bums you out, right?  Well, it doesn't bum me out, but what I'm saying.  I just said it upsets you.  Well, I don't mean it upsets me like that.  What I'm saying is...  How sad do you get, Rich?  Yeah.  When they pan down and just stop at the belly button line with that line of hair, do you  go like, oh, in the theater?  Damaged!  Come on, pan down! 
[00:52:00]  Why are you teasing me?  Yeah, tease!  Drill this hole for nothing.  All right, E-Rock ran in with something and gave me a huge thumbs up.  We might have to switch gears here.  What do you got, E-Rock?  Bad hair?  Besides bad hair.  I'm sure the list goes on, but...  A huge pelican neck and a big beer belly.  What else do you got going on?  I was leaving you alone on the hair there, Pally.  Anyway, this comes from Detroit, their Fox News affiliate out there.  They're discussing the physical relationship of the Obamas, and that's pretty much all 
[00:52:30]  we can say about it.  The physical relationship of the Obamas, meaning like a family tree?  No, meaning like their affection towards each other.  Their lovey-dovey crap?  Their lovey-dovey stuff.  Okay, I thought you meant like relatives and stuff.  No.  Uh-huh.  Really?  And it's good?  It's good.  Don't comment afterwards?  Yes.  Like keep it very vague?  Keep it vague.  It'll...  In other words, expect Rich to screw this up royally when he says something stupid at 
[00:53:00]  the end of it.  I'll be quiet.  I don't want to get anybody in trouble.  This is called the standalone piece where you just understand it.  Stand alone.  You just understand what's going on here.  It's like a Monet.  All right.  Just stand back and look.  Well, the media was just over the top with how much in love these two are.  Yeah, they...  A lot of hand-holding and affection.  They brought in a love doctor expert to discuss the relationship of the Obamas.  Yeah.  All right.  We also need to be affectionate.  And you can see that with Barack and Michelle. 
[00:53:30]  I hate these experts, man.  We got to do a whole freaking show on the expert that goes on TV and talks about love and relationships.  And I hate these people.  What are you doing there?  That reminded me of something I saw last night.  So I'm actually jotting it down so I don't forget.  All right.  Good.  Right after this, you'll talk about it.  Jot it down, Ralph.  You got to jot it down.  Yeah.  All right.  Curse this, though.  We also need to be affectionate.  And you can see that with Barack and Michelle as well.  They do a lot of touching, kissing, even fisting. 
[00:54:00]  See?  Stand out.  That's why I'm clapping.  I'm trying to behave.  I got to back that clip up.  Look.  There's even a joke there.  Look.  Just say luck.  Look.  Look.  Look.  Everyone, just calm down.  All right.  Calm down, everybody.  All right.  Take a...  Get out the exits.  Stand on the wings. 
[00:54:30]  Don't do anything stupid.  Yeah, where's Sully when we need him?  Sully!  We need you to save us.  Bring this one in.  Let's leave it to Sully.  General, what you just heard, I hope it's...  Just leave it alone.  I'll take care of business.  It's okay.  Seems a flock of birds have hit the show.  Don't worry.  Don't say anything.  Wow.  All right. 
[00:55:00]  Well, listen.  Let me play that again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  Where's Sam, by the way?  This is perfect for the beep game.  Let's do a little beep game with this, too.  It really is.  That is true.  Because there's a lot of ING words here.  I haven't done that in a while.  Let's do the beep game afterwards.  But first, here's the original clip.  We also need to be affectionate.  And you can see that with Barack and Michelle as well.  They do a lot of touching, kissing, even fisting with one another. 
[00:55:30]  And that is so very important.  Because couples really need to feel like they're physically bonded to one another.  Oh, my God.  No.  No, she didn't.  I have another contest we could have here.  Oh, Shretch.  Yes, sir.  This was part of their local affiliate stuff in the morning.  So this was during...  Did anybody pick up on anything and make a face? 
[00:56:00]  Make an awe?  No, they kept the camera on the actual Love Doctor expert there.  Yeah.  They didn't cut to the rest of the people.  But that's all the clip had.  Sam, do the bleep game immediately.  Wow.  I have a...  Very good find.  You can't ask questions about this without getting in trouble?  You can't ask?  There's nothing to ask.  We've all seen when they greeted each other on the stage.  Yeah.  During the primaries, I believe.  They would take their fists and bump them together on stage. 
[00:56:30]  Like you do if you have a cold or something, and you don't want to shake hands.  You give a little fist bump.  They love to fist each other.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's what that girl was talking about in that clip.  That's what...  Yeah.  Because my...  Rich Voss, we're going to have to ask you to please, you have the right to remain silent.  Anything you say can and will get us thrown off the air.  Rich Voss is the guy.  We're in the middle of this bit.  If we were on a plane, we would be tackling you. 
[00:57:00]  And restraining you.  You'd be getting sat on by a lacrosse player.  Rich would be that guy like, oh, I've got to go to the bathroom, and he's trying to open the door to the plane.  Open the actual door.  What's wrong with you?  Sometimes these standalone bits are just that.  Clam up.  Many different angles to look at this.  Yes, there is.  But just...  It's a standalone.  Okay.  It's a standalone.  Is that radio talk? 
[00:57:30]  It's this show's talk.  Hey, not allowed.  Kevin from Connecticut.  All right.  I smell a bit.  Maybe we could do a little something.  Maybe just the chorus of what you're getting at.  But Kevin from Connecticut writes, wasn't that a Journey song?  Love and touching.  Now they say love and touching a feeling.  I think he missed that.  Yeah, but what I'm saying, if we take just that piece of that song, Sam, I'm talking to you in the office, 
[00:58:00]  and then do the bleep game in that song, just to kind of make this bit a little stronger.  I hear you.  See, we like to do all our show prep right in front of you.  On the air.  It makes it so much easier for us, which is really the end game here.  Look, it allows us to sleep an extra hour.  Give us a break.  But Sam, maybe you could do love and touching, blanking.  Right.  Keep the loving and the touching part in there.  What was he writing down?  Let me see. 
[00:58:30]  Now he's just making immature drawings on the cover of the newspaper.  Aren't you like 58?  What's wrong with you?  Oh, my God.  Benjamin Butthead.  You're a child.  I got to hear that again.  After the break, this is the big radio tease.  After the break, we'll do the bleep game with this fine clip you just heard.  Yeah.  We also need to be affectionate. 
[00:59:00]  And you can see that with Barack and Michelle as well.  They do a lot of touching, kissing, even fisting with one another.  And that is so very important because couples really need to feel like they're physically bonded to one another.  And if that doesn't bond you.  It is a very, you know, it's kind of like a buddy thing. 
[00:59:30]  Seemed like a good idea at the time.  Now we got to wait for the EMTs.  All right.  We better take a break.  Was that really?  That was.  Brace for a crash.  Brace for a crash.  Opie and Anthony.  Definitely having a good one today.  Opie and Anthony starring Rich Voss today. 
[01:00:00]  We like to do this from time to time.  For the people around our age, give or take five, five to ten years on either side.  We point out stuff that makes you realize your life is just flying by.  Ridiculous rate.  First of all, Heath Ledger, this is not one of those, but I might as well throw this in the mix.  It was a year ago today.  That was a quick year, huh?  Get out of here. 
[01:00:30]  That was a quick year.  Wow.  Wow.  A year ago today.  Feels like yesterday.  It does, right?  For real.  Well, not yesterday.  That's kind of pushing it.  Well, that's the same.  A lot of Journey fans out there.  Yeah.  This will make you feel a little old.  Steve Perry, the big 6-0 today.  No way.  The big 6-0.  So when I was listening to Journey, not so much these days, Steve Perry is now older than my father was when I was listening to Journey. 
[01:01:00]  Wow.  You start pulling the this person was younger than I am now stuff.  Oh, I know.  Oh, that freaks you out.  Oh, I know.  Here's one.  Now, today, John Lennon, dead.  I couldn't.  You died today?  What are you?  Oh, you're doing in today, today in history? 
[01:01:30]  Oh, is that what you're doing?  This sucks.  I'm rich.  Oh, I see.  Oh, I see.  You're doing today in history like they do that little clip in the paper.  Well, that's why it was a year ago today.  Oh, I see.  Today.  Today.  Today.  Not a year and maybe two and a half months ago today.  Yeah.  That's my quick math.  Now, it would be a year and a month.  Oh, wow.  What else happened a year ago today?  Well, no.  It's not a year ago.  Jesus.  It's just today. 
[01:02:00]  Like, Steve Perry is 60 today.  Oh, okay.  Which makes you feel very old because we all remember the young Steve Perry.  That's what I'm getting at.  Oh, that's what got me also, funny enough, stupid Rich just said about John Lennon.  He was 40.  When he died?  Yeah.  That's why I was bringing it up.  John Lennon was 40.  Oh, because things, all right, I got you now.  And then when you blow past that, you're just like, yeesh.  Everyone remembers Ted Kaczynski.  That little Unabomber thing, right? 
[01:02:30]  How many years ago do you think it was, Ant?  And B, that he got caught or did it?  I'm not even trying to do the math.  I'm just trying to use the force.  Pled guilty on this date how many years ago?  I will say 12 years.  All right.  Am I close?  Very close, 11.  Doesn't seem like 11 years is the point.  I was going to say 13.  I should have went the other way.  The point I'm getting at.  I think those are the only ones for today that make you kind of feel like your life is flying by.  All right. 
[01:03:00]  We're going to play the bleep game with that clip we played.  Yeah.  We got to make it very obvious what we're about to do.  That's how dangerous this thing is.  Yeah.  We just got a clip from Detroit TV where this woman is just like, instead of saying fist  bump, said something else.  Yeah.  Which is just amazing.  Now we're going to take that audio and we're going to beep it and it's going to sound over  the top outrageous to the point where we got to play the original clip as a reference  point.  Yes.  Just so you know what was really said. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  We're going to do that in a few minutes.  They're almost done with that.  But first, we got a Hitler update.  Ah.  Still dead.  Right?  Well, the kid.  In Jersey.  Oh.  Oh, the adorable little Hitler child.  Yeah.  He's so cute.  You see him?  He's just a little.  And it was his birthday.  And then the parents.  No cake.  No cake for you.  He wanted, you know, the parents wanted Adolf Hitler.  Yeah.  Put on the cake and they wouldn't put it on for the little kid. 
[01:04:00]  It's his birthday for God's sake.  This is, you know.  And how did that get to the news?  Then the bakery went and called the news or something?  Some Budinsky over at the supermarket.  Some blabber mouth over at the supermarket.  I had to call up the press.  It was Goldstein's.  Say Adolf Hitler wants a cake.  It was Goldstein's supermarket, right?  Was that what it was?  It was Goldstein's.  All right.  Maybe that is a little insult to injury.  Here's the thing which upsets me.  Okay.  The kid's name.  I mean, the whole kid.  First of all, the parents obviously don't want this kid to have a few. 
[01:04:30]  Steve from Bayshore.  Cake is spelt differently than you've spelt it.  Yeah.  There's an A in there.  It's not an I.  Why is he using two Ks to spell cake?  But obviously they don't want this kid to have a job.  It's like tattooing your face.  Once you tattoo your face, you know you can only work certain places.  Yeah.  Boardwalks.  You know, Hitler.  Okay.  You know he's not going to be like a landlord or superintendent. 
[01:05:00]  I smell gas.  You know what I mean?  You do bring up.  That's a very good object.  He has the choice.  Whether you agree or disagree with what's going on there, there's a lot of employers out there.  It would be a little rough to hire a Hitler to their company.  He doesn't have to use the name, you know.  Well, on a cake, he wants it.  You can't have your cake and be Hitler, too.  But when he goes to get a job when he's older, he can say, you know, my name's Dolph.  Yeah.  Kind of, you know.  The Fuhrer. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Just kind of modernize it a little bit.  Okay.  But what upsets me about, okay, so that's his name.  But the bakery, who are they to decide what they put?  Like, I had a business card made up once, and it said, Rich Voss, you know who the F I am.  And the printing company wouldn't print that word.  Did you spell out the F word?  Yeah.  Okay.  Why wouldn't they print?  Who cares?  You know what I'm saying?  Who makes these decisions?  What's wrong?  They just didn't want to put a lie on the card.  I was just going to pass it out to my family. 
[01:06:00]  It wasn't the word.  It was the content.  Hitler.  Where does the kid get a job?  Yeah, Hitler.  Well, we got an update.  Last we left this story, they removed little Hitler from the parents and the rest of the kids  that had pretty good names, too, right?  Yeah.  Aryan Nation.  Little Aryan Nation.  That was the girl.  That was the name?  Yeah, it was a longer name.  And then there's another one with, like, some name.  Himmler.  I think Himmler's in there somewhere.  Cousin Mussolini. 
[01:06:30]  But, yeah, but, of course, the focus was on the adorable little cherub-faced Adolf Hitler.  They just had a problem.  And apparently a neighbor, I guess, turned him in.  Yeah.  So now the mom, she's not.  With accusations of abuse.  Yeah.  The mom's not supposed to talk whatsoever, but she couldn't keep her mouth shut.  Court-ordered gag order on this case, which is ridiculous, because, and she said she came  out because they need a lawyer.  Right.  How does the court order you to not speak about this? 
[01:07:00]  It stuns me that the court would order that you can't tell your side of this story when  a neighbor uses tactics from Nazi Germany, where they would say, I believe a Jew lives  next door.  And then the assessor would come up and sweep you away.  And that's what this neighbor did to this family.  Poor little, look at poor little Hitler.  And if you go to the house. 
[01:07:30]  It's taken away.  If you don't know how to get to your house, you go down Main Street, make two lefts, and  the Third Reich, you'll get.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  This is going great.  But so if you call, if you call and just make an accusation, that's enough?  Like if someone called and said, well, let's get the story out.  Well, he's giving it right now.  No, I got a clip.  Oh, a clip.  See, just because we don't know the full story.  Yeah, I don't know.  Here's your update on little Hitler. 
[01:08:00]  So it was January 9th, after all the to-do over the children's names, that Difus came  to you.  What did they say?  What's their explanation?  Their explanation, why the children were removed, is because they felt the children  were in danger for their lives.  Physically in danger?  They didn't say anything.  All they said was the children were in danger there.  Psychologically?  Physically?  They didn't say physically, mentally, nothing like that.  Do you understand why you might not appear sympathetic to so many people after the children? 
[01:08:30]  Yes.  Well, actually, we found their names in baby books.  Oh, my God.  Oh, they just popped up.  She's not supposed to talk to this thing.  From 1932.  Baby books.  They still have that one in there, huh?  Come on.  No way.  Baby book?  No way.  Wow.  And baby books.  Just because a mother is full of crap doesn't mean you've got to take a little Hitler away. 
[01:09:00]  She's trying to claim it's just an innocent little name.  I'm starting to think they really railroaded this mother.  They really didn't like it.  I'm sure the neighbors weren't very happy.  They're not happy that a kid's named Hitler.  That's what this comes down to.  I think, you know, in America, you know, you've got to kind of accept this.  I believe the husband had prior domestic abuse allegations, if not charges against him, with a wife, an ex-wife.  All right.  But I don't believe that there were any with this wife. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, that's in...  I don't know.  We've got more.  Let's see where they go with this.  Children.  Yes.  Well, actually, we found their names in baby books.  Their names, Adolf's name is actually in a baby book.  Adolf Hitler.  It states in there about Adolf Hitler how he was a noble wolf, a German noble wolf, in one of the books.  And in the other book, it states in there how he is an old German hero.  How he helped Germany defeat in World War II. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  In history books...  That may not be the perception most people have that Adolf Hitler was a hero.  Do you understand that that may be the case?  They're unusual names.  To me, they're unusual names.  Come on.  She is, you know.  Come on.  She's named...  She's a little delusional.  No, she's not.  She's trying to save her kids.  She names her kid Hitler, and she knows why she named her kid Hitler.  It's in a baby book.  It means noble wolf.  Adolf means noble wolf.  Steve from Bayshore says it.  You know it's true. 
[01:10:30]  And if you were a German at the time, you know, I guess you kind of dug the guy.  Adolf is in a baby book, according to Larry and P.A.  We got a great one coming in from Matt on Long Island.  I think he's a regular.  Matt, how are you, buddy?  All right.  How's it going?  Good, man.  I want to know, how are they supposed to find a good lawyer if they hate Jews?  Yeah.  I don't know just because they named their kid Adolf Hitler if that makes them anti-Semitic.  It's anti-Semitic, does it?  Rich Voss, comment?  Oh, Sam has brought in the bleep game. 
[01:11:00]  I think what's...  Oh.  Wow, Sam.  Worked fast.  We'll get that on in a second.  We got another clip from this mom as her kids were taken away from her.  Yeah.  Because they named it the little boy Hitler.  Adolf Hitler.  And the girl was what?  Huh?  What's the girl?  Aryan Nation was in her name.  It was like something, something, Aryan Nation.  Uh-huh.  Hitler and Himmler.  It's actually not Himmler.  It's Himmler.  Himmler.  Hey, look.  She's like Nostradamus with the quatrains. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  It was one letter off.  It was Hister.  A man named Hister.  We actually named it Heimlich.  As in choking.  Yeah, see?  Heimlich maneuver.  Right.  I named my kid after a maneuver.  Yeah.  Not a Nazi.  Hitler and Himmler.  It's actually not Himmler.  It's Himmler, which is completely different.  Get it right, kid.  I love how she's getting her little attitude in there. 
[01:12:00]  It's different.  Well, sorry.  I mean, the one kid's named Hitler.  God forbid we assume where you're going with these names.  Hitler and Himmler.  It's actually not Himmler.  It's Himmler, which is completely different than Himmler.  Again, I would ask.  Do you understand?  Goebbels.  Right, right.  And those aren't SS tattoos on her shoulder.  I didn't have a punchline to go after it, though.  Coring. 
[01:12:30]  Superman.  Just change one letter.  Yeah.  I love the attitude she's got.  But this reporter did a very good job.  Most reporters would have backed down.  Again, I would ask.  Do you understand, though, that people might be offended by the concept that someone who was involved with the deaths of so many people might not be an appropriate name for a child?  Yes, I do.  But they're just names.  I don't see nothing wrong.  They're just unusual names.  There's...  You have the right to name your child, but you want to name them. 
[01:13:00]  Which is true.  You don't think I'm for his birthday?  What?  A Hess truck.  And Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Who doesn't love a good Nazi joke?  There's her update.  She's talking.  She's not supposed to be talking.  All right.  If you're just tuning in, the guys found an amazing clip from a TV station in Detroit. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  You know, everyone saw the Obamas being lovey-dovey, and they had a love expert.  Oh, which is...  First of all, a love expert makes a faux pas like this and doesn't even realize she's saying it?  Right.  Everyone else realized.  Yeah.  That that's not what...  Some love expert.  Yeah.  And you jotted something down?  Do you want to say that now?  No, we'll do this.  All right, all right, cool.  Because it kind of stands alone.  Here's the original clip, which just is amazing.  And then we asked Sam to do some bleeps in the clip. 
[01:14:00]  We like to do this from time to time.  It's a bit Craig Ferguson pretty much started.  Yeah.  And we have no problem admitting that, because people come in after a...  Funny bit.  Funny bit.  You know, use it.  Sure.  But we have to play the original clip, or we just get in trouble.  Yeah, yeah.  So here it is, the original clip.  We also need to be affectionate.  And you can see that with Barack and Michelle as well.  They do a lot of touching, kissing, even fisting with one another. 
[01:14:30]  And that is so very important, because couples really need to feel like they're physically bonded to one another.  And then she uses the word bonded.  She certainly did, Opie.  I know, I know.  I'm just saying.  That's all we can say about that.  Yeah.  I'm just saying.  That's all we can say about that.  So then Sam did some...  Some work on the clip.  Some beeping.  They do a little beeping, and wow.  It hammers the point home. 
[01:15:00]  All right.  I can say that, right?  Of course you can.  You just did.  All right.  We also need to be affectionate.  And you can see that with Barack and Michelle as well.  They do a lot of...  ...ing, ...ing, even fisting.  And that is so very important, because couples really need to feel like they're f***ing one another.  Oh, my God. 
[01:15:30]  Wow.  We played the original clip first.  Yes, we did.  One word made the original first.  Yes, we did, Sam.  Yes, we did.  Bravo.  You know, sometimes when you add the I-N-G from one word and put it at the end of the bleep of it, you just combine syllables.  It's amazing.  Mm-hmm.  Well, that's something. 
[01:16:00]  So you hate sex experts as much.  You know what gets me is what...  It's like, you know what it is?  What gets me?  How do you beep something, and it's worse than the un-beeped one?  No kidding.  It's just astounding.  And just to bring it all home, because Steve Perry's celebrating his 60th birthday, so you take the Steve Perry journey thing,  you play off that clip a little bit, and you got that, Danny, and then you get this.  With the Obamas.  And each other. 
[01:16:30]  Each other?  Wow.  Wow.  You're tearing me apart.  And scene.  Right.  Got the print.  Perfect.  And that's the brilliance of us, by the way.  We're going to pat ourselves on the back.  We did all that on the fly.  We don't need show prep.  Show prep is for morning zoos. 
[01:17:00]  Show prep?  Yes.  Show shmep.  That's right, Anthony.  How's Vince?  Good?  That's right.  No update yet.  We don't know.  Shut up.  So the love expert thing, what were you saying there, Rich?  Because when you see him on TV, you know what, it's like, you know what it is, a love expert  should be a hooker or somebody that comes in.  Like when I was in rehab, the drug counselors that were ex-drug addicts were ten times better  and smarter than the counselors that went to school.  Do you know what I mean? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's on-the-job training with your experts.  Doing drugs or you read a book.  All the gang bangers when they do the little chats with them.  It's former gang guys that seem to have the most influence over them.  Yeah.  You can't read a book, a sex expert, please.  Now, Ant, I want to go back to the Journey song, if you could cue that up.  Oh, does the song continue, Danny, or is that where they cut it?  That's where we got it.  Oh, because Kevin from Connecticut goes, guys, as funny as that was, the next line was, now  it's your turn, girl, to cry. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, yeah, there is a line in there.  All right, sorry.  Never listen to that song the same way.  Yeah.  Well, what is the thing you jotted down?  Oh, my little observation.  I was watching Greta Van Sestrand.  Little Greta Van Sestrand.  How tight is her face these days?  Well, I don't really pay attention to the way she looks.  It was the story that was on. 
[01:18:30]  It's that little, that murder of that girl by the hot mother.  A.T. and Kaylee.  The mother that's my type or something.  She looks like the last ten girlfriends you had.  I know.  Oh, my God.  I just kind of find her a little attractive.  Boy, do you have a type.  I do have a type.  I do have a type.  I do have a type and vulnerable.  You certainly have a type, my friend.  I find her a little vulnerable.  Greta.  You love the suicide girls.  Yeah, what, she's, um...  Her last name's Anthony, by the way.  Casey.  Casey Anthony, right?  Casey and Kaylee.  Which one's the dead one? 
[01:19:00]  The kid.  I think Kaylee is.  Kaylee is the dead kid.  The kid was adorable, too.  And then, aw.  Aren't they all?  Just give it to your mom and then just go do what you want.  They had, uh, they had clips of, um, her on the phone, uh, from prison with her parents.  That was pretty interesting.  Just looking at her all mad that she's, you know, I'm in here.  Get me out.  Uh, but that wasn't even it.  Uh, I just found it odd that, um, years after the initial OJ trial, where OJ got away with 
[01:19:30]  murder, we have, uh, a black president and OJ's in prison, yet Mark Furman was doing commentary  on Greta's show.  He's got a gig and OJ's in prison.  So, it filled me with a little hope that there is still a hope for the white man.  From a dead baby, you turned into a hope for the white man. 
[01:20:00]  No, it was just, the story was secondary.  It just stunned me that she goes, well, now let's go, because they had Michael Bodden on  also.  That ghoul.  That ghoul was talking about, like, the condition this little girl was in.  It was just horrifying.  But, uh, and then they're like, well, let's bring on our other expert, Mark Furman.  I'm like, how did Mark Furman get a gig?  But I guess he's been talking with, uh, Fox for a while.  They bring him in as an expert.  And, uh, like nothing, but every time I see him, all I think is, ah, there's the N-word 
[01:20:30]  guy.  It's the time thing.  Enough time goes by.  Enough time went by?  It doesn't matter.  Where it's fine?  Yeah, it don't matter.  But did you think when OJ got acquitted and Mark Furman was destroyed, that in 2008 and  then, you know, 2009, uh, we'd have a black president, OJ would be in prison and Mark Furman  and have a great gig. 
[01:21:00]  I mean, yeah, at the time, I mean, William Ayers is a professor now, right?  Isn't he a professor in Chicago?  Oh.  So I guess you could do anything.  And all, who, who?  William Ayers?  Yeah.  A professor.  He's a professor.  Yeah, well, they're all professors.  That's right.  Aren't they?  Aren't they all professors?  Like these radical, ugh.  Was Greta Van Suskind shot in the face?  Who?  What's her name?  Greta Van Suskind.  What's her name?  Yeah, David Suskind. 
[01:21:30]  What?  Greta Van Suskind.  Hey, uh, Puddle of AIDS, thank you.  Going back to the Adolf Hitler story.  Should have been the first picture of Puddle of AIDS.  Adolf Hitler's dad.  Yeah.  This is a true story according to NJ.com.  Puddle of AIDS, thank you.  Adolf Hitler's dad was pulled over on the way to the court to reclaim their children.  He was going to get his children, but he was pulled over, uh, and, wait, he was going 
[01:22:00]  to, just update, sorry, guys.  All right, let me just, all right, here it is.  Adolf Hitler's dad was pulled over on the way to the court to reclaim their children and  give custody to their grandmother.  Uh-huh.  So he was going to do that.  Uh, however, the grandmother was so drunk that the police gave a sobriety test.  All right.  So she likes to tip a few back.  Apparently doesn't sound quite right.  Let grandma take Hitler.  But she's very drunk.  I'm so. 
[01:22:30]  This is in Jersey.  Jersey.  Yeah.  This isn't in Alabama.  Oh, I know.  When I first heard this, I thought it had to be some really backwoods down south.  But Jersey's a huge state.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there's a lot of different.  Jersey's got some problems.  What are those people that live in the woods?  The pine barrens?  The albinos or something?  The albinos that live in the woods.  Albino midgets?  Something.  I don't know what it is.  They got, Jersey's full of freaks. 
[01:23:00]  They got some weird areas.  Yeah, you go to South Jersey.  Or North North or South South.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like.  Here's, uh.  The Jackson Whites.  The Jackson Whites.  That's right.  The Jackson Whites.  Is there five of them?  They live in the woods and stuff.  And they have sex with each other, I think.  Yeah, it's like some kind of ex-files.  I'm serious.  It's really creepy.  Yeah.  Maybe it's a South Jersey radio contest.  Where. . .  Okay, I don't know.  Let's. . .  Let's get. . .  No, let's go to break.  Wait, let me say Manhattan Comedy Club.  Uh. . . 
[01:23:30]  Where's the Manhattan Comedy Club?  I'll be at the Manhattan Comedy Club February 6th and 7th.  It's a new club in Middletown, New York.  But. . .  The Manhattan Comedy Club.  Why don't they call themselves the Middletown Comedy Club?  Because it's not as catchy as the Manhattan Comedy Club.  But. . .  Okay. . .  It's not in Manhattan.  That's. . .  That's so true.  It's up in Middletown.  Okay, you know what. . .  I'm just trying to help these club owners.  They name their clubs stupidly.  I. . .  It might be a nice place, but if you're in Middletown, call yourself the Middletown Comedy Club.  Well, listen. . .  Well, listen. . .  Comedy Club.  I've eaten in Subways, and it doesn't smell like piss in there, okay? 
[01:24:00]  It's just a name, stupid.  Good point.  So, it's the Manhattan Comedy Club in Middletown, February 6th or 7th.  I'm telling you, listen to me.  Right.  You can go to the message boards.  Go anywhere.  Any ONA fan that's seen Rich Voss on stage knows he's going to kill.  You will never see the same show twice.  I promise you, you'll leave having a good time.  Absolutely.  845-346-4242.  All right.  Very good.  On the way, we have a story about a football camp hazing.  These stories.  They're always good. 
[01:24:30]  Come out one a year easy.  God, they're so gay.  Football guys love. . .  Love the gay.  Love the gay.  Yes.  And then you got some other things.  I'm looking at them right now.  Good stuff.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out this morning.  That's it?  That's all you get?  That's all you get.  What the F, man? 
[01:25:00]  What was today's problem?  That's the only rejoiner.  That's all you get.  I'm sick of our rejoiner.  They're cutting back on rejoiner length for cost.  I'm sick of our rejoiners.  We've got to freshen them up.  Somebody from the Philly crew gave me a whole list of songs we could maybe use.  Really?  So we're going to go through that.  Yeah.  Are they good?  Hip it up a little bit, you know?  Like hip?  Like hip.  And what went?  Hip, bop, bop, bop, bop.  I don't know.  Just some cool songs.  So we've got to switch that up a little bit.  Some quick hits for everybody.  Anthony, I know you're very disappointed because you were hoping for the worst. 
[01:25:30]  But it's now coming out, no arrests, no injuries.  Oh, I know.  I read it.  No significant property damage reported at the inauguration.  Yeah.  You were hoping that all hell would break loose, weren't you?  That's what one cop per person will do.  I love how you can spin anything, my friend.  It's perfect.  I love how you can spin it.  I can't say that about the Notorious movie.  No, exactly.  There you go.  Yeah, I was 1.1, look, 5, 6 million people down there. 
[01:26:00]  No significant incidents reported, but one lousy showing of Notorious.  Three stabbings, a shooting, and four gold teeth stolen.  You'd think the movie's in 3D.  Wow, this is realistic.  It's so, you go into theaters and there's metal detectors.  Yeah, of course. 
[01:26:30]  I don't get it either.  No, all right, so you got that happening.  Fidel Castro believes in Obama.  Yeah, boy, he hasn't blogged in quite a while, old Fidel.  No.  And he came out with a rousing endorsement for Obama.  Makes me feel good.  The last friggin' bastion of pure communism is endorsing our president.  You've got to think any day now we'll be able to book our flights to Cuba.  I hear the beaches down there are just terrific.  Puffing on those Cuban cigars. 
[01:27:00]  It's just waiting for us.  Nice.  You lucky Canadians, you.  Yeah, they can go down there any time they want because no one cares.  It's like, what's Canada going to do?  Right.  And then we're learning that they found the engine in the Hudson River and possible bird  found in the engine.  Uh-huh.  Or maybe that's the one they already had.  I don't know.  Yeah.  But they found the second engine.  They thought they lost both engines.  Good old Sully doing his crash landing in the river there.  And they found the second engine that was at the bottom of the river.  Yeah, they found some bird, what they think were bird parts in the wing. 
[01:27:30]  With a turban.  It's not a terrorism joke.  I made it into one.  And it's funny.  You laugh.  But I don't know.  I guess you guys did.  I guess that's the job of radio show hosts when this happened the day after.  Yeah.  I mean, this was a big story.  But there were some radio hosts that really were milking it.  You know, they were getting bird lovers on.  And, you know, I mean, when a cat called into one station, it was ridiculous where, okay, 
[01:28:00]  the guy landed a plane.  That's his job, to land planes.  Okay, so he did it on water.  In the water.  Okay, on water.  Yeah.  But what you think that's.  You see the bottom of that plane?  Yeah.  It was a wreck.  It was a wreck.  Yeah, the plane looks great from the top.  Yeah.  But if you're one of those guys, it was no big deal?  Oh, no.  He hit the water at about 170.  No, no, of course.  The big deal.  I think he was able to slow it down at 120, 125.  I think more of the big deal was the decision to land it there. 
[01:28:30]  Split second decision.  That was the deal, was the decision.  He made that decision.  Not to go to Tito.  You've got to think he made that decision knowing that people would die.  Yeah, he said it.  It worked out great for everybody.  But he's making a decision like, well, maybe less people will die if I could land this thing  in the river.  Yeah.  Or crash this in the river.  That's the, I think that's where his brilliance is, is it was the decision.  The landing, okay, it worked out.  You had to keep that nose up.  I mean, it was.  Keep your nose up.  It was quite impressive. 
[01:29:00]  Quite impressive.  All I know is I would have been the one guy walking out of the plane near the store  with a Louis Vuitton bag on his shoulder, okay, that was not sinking.  Dude, your gay bag, you would have taken that with you.  That's what I got out of that whole thing.  Pushed you in the water.  That's what I got out of that.  From now on, I'm not putting my Louis Vuitton above.  I'm putting it right by my seat in case I, so I could just pick it up and walk out on  the wing if I have to.  I've been studying those pictures a little more closely the last couple of days.  There were a couple of guys that had their carry-ons as they're hanging out on the wing 
[01:29:30]  waiting to be rescued.  Why not?  If you got it.  I usually put mine under the seat in front of me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why, and then if something happens, I'm grabbing that.  I guess you're right.  I guess you would take it at that point.  Roll my stuff in there.  And also coming out today, the Hokey Pokey.  Yeah.  It's actually about doing cocaine, according to the son of the...  When I read this...  This is one of those film stories, right?  Come on.  I had the song going through my head, and I'm like, this has nothing to do with cocaine. 
[01:30:00]  I know.  When I try to get my cocaine, the guy never asked me to do the Hokey Pokey.  Well, the way you dressed, sexy.  You were doing the pokey.  Where's the cocaine part?  Yeah.  Where's the cocaine part?  Old version.  You put your right foot in, you put your right foot out, you put your right foot in, and you 
[01:30:30]  shake it all about.  Anyone?  I've never put my right foot in and out when I was doing coke.  Right.  It was, you know...  You put your right nostril in.  You put the 20 in.  You roll the 20 up.  And you babble all about.  You babble all about.  Oh, my God.  You do the Hokey Pokey, then spend the whole night trying to catch the buzz you got off the 
[01:31:00]  first hit.  And it never quite comes around.  You sell your mom's stereo and turn two tricks.  That's what it's all about.  Who would snort coke?  What a waste.  Jesus, Rick.  That's how you start.  Got to start somewhere.  But you started smoking it?  You didn't even start, like, snorting?  Oh, no.  I did, but after smoking, it's like reading a book backwards.  Who does that?  Snorting was the easy way to do it.  If you were, like, in a bar, you could just do one of those little ones, you know, out 
[01:31:30]  of the little brown thing with the little spoon on the lid.  And then you do it in the bar.  You can't be breaking a crack pipe out in the bathroom at the bar.  And then you get these guys that wanted to be so cool, and they grew their pinky fingernail  long.  That was never cool.  Or they wanted you to kind of know that they did it, you know, sort of, wow, man, dude.  You want to bump?  You want to bump?  Shut it.  I know.  You want to bump.  Shut up.  Bump.  But you look down, you think, people are still, like, since I quit smoking and I watch 
[01:32:00]  people smoke, like, even, especially girls, I go, how do you, who does that?  You know what I mean?  And recently I was working somewhere, and I think one of the colleagues were so coked  up, you could tell their mouth.  Oh, the jaw goes, yes.  The jaw is going sideways.  See, and I used to try to pretend, like, I was so wired on coke, and people, I knew the  jaw could tell, so no matter what, every, like, 30 seconds I would just pretend and yawn  like I wasn't.  I would go, ah. 
[01:32:30]  Your jaw spins around your entire head backwards.  You grind your teeth into $42,000 worth of implants, dislodging your jaw like a snake.  Right.  You guys want to know?  Dead giveaway.  You want to know why the Hokey Pokey is a cocaine song?  All right.  All right.  The Hokey Pokey, the right-hand in, right-hand out ditty that sparked the 1950s dance craze  has become the focus of a bizarre controversy in Britain that has drawn in politicians, the 
[01:33:00]  Catholic Church in Scotland, and soccer fans accused of exploiting the song's alleged anti-Catholic  roots to taunt opposing teams.  Anti-Catholic roots?  What?  Boy, are they reading into this one.  All right.  Let's keep going here.  Now, the son of the famed Irish songwriter.  So that's what people thought the song was about.  Okay, I got you.  Now, the songwriter's son, Jimmy Kennedy, son of the famed...  Wait a minute.  All right.  All right.  Now, the son of the famed Irish songwriter, Jimmy Kennedy, the man credited with penning 
[01:33:30]  the lyrics to one of the world's most familiar melodies, has weighed into the furor by revealing  that what he calls the true inspiration for his father's hit, a traditional Canadian folk  tune sung by miners in the early 20th century as a drug anthem celebrating the therapeutic  powers of cocaine.  I love Canadian miners.  Canadian miners sang this song.  It's a joke.  The song is known in Britain as...  Very inside.  The Hokey Cokey.  The Hokey Cokey. 
[01:34:00]  And was originally published by Kennedy during the Second World War as the Cokey Cokey.  Oh, well, that would be a little obvious.  Before various U.S. recordings of the Hokey Pokey gave the song and its accompanying movement's  global popularity.  How long was cocaine around?  You do the Cokey Cokey.  Cocaine used to be like...  And coke.  Yeah, it really accepted.  And coke.  Pharmacists would just...  It was never in Coca-Cola.  The original Coke had a little bit of Coke in there.  It really was.  Do you really believe that?  Yes.  It was.  That's a fact. 
[01:34:30]  Yes.  How is that a fact?  That means they would have to have vats, big vats of cocaine in...  They just didn't know any better.  They thought like morphine was good.  First of all, they weren't selling Coca-Cola like they do now with tanker trucks.  Well, they weren't selling four cans a week either.  That was mostly in the soda shops.  Yeah.  And that.  And there was cocaine in it.  That's the coca in Coca-Cola.  It's still the part of the name.  And it was... 
[01:35:00]  Oh, for real.  It started out as a medical thing, as a medicine.  It was some kind of energy elixir.  And then it tasted so good that people started drinking it.  I'm surprised I didn't know that.  I'm usually up on things.  Well, you got to watch the History Channel, I believe, did a thing on that.  I don't know.  Marvels or something.  I'm writing.  I'm writing.  Geez.  I'm reading this book on people through history that were considered geniuses and why they're... 
[01:35:30]  And are asses.  And their personal lives are all left up.  Ah.  And the crazy stuff these people got into because they just didn't know any better.  Nitrix...  Nitrix...  Nitrix oxide?  Yeah.  Was a big thing.  People thought that was...  It was gas.  They thought that was healthy and better for you than oxygen.  There was a whole movement that happened with that.  My favorite ever is the shoe stores.  That brought in x-ray machines.  These things were so dangerous and so radioactive. 
[01:36:00]  Like, it wasn't like an x-ray machine now that uses a very low dose of radiation.  They protect you still with the lead.  The doctor steps out.  This was...  They just knew that if you threw enough radiation at something, you could see through stuff.  Right.  So they put them in shoe stores so that you could look at the bones in your feet and then  the shoe guy would be like, well, if you look at this, we could tell you need this width  of a shoe or a different... 
[01:36:30]  They used it as like a...  It was more of a kind of a conversation piece thing than real tool for a shoe guy.  But it was...  You know, people would go in there all amazed.  It was to get people in the store.  And it was just leukemia.  Kids getting leukemia like crazy because of these x-ray machines that if you even need...  I think everyone that worked in a shoe store back then dies.  Yeah.  It's just irradiating everything.  When you read up on our ancestors and you look at old videos, they were just dumb people. 
[01:37:00]  How did we ever...  There we go.  How did we ever survive as humans?  Madame Curie, she wound up dying from radiation poisoning because she was just effing with the  stuff all the time.  That was her gig.  We talked about the big, tall Abraham Lincoln hats.  Big stovepipe hats.  That they wore in the winter.  How does that hat keep you warm?  Yeah.  What is that?  Yeah, I know.  Like the heat that's coming out of your head, by the time it gets to the top of that hat,  it's cold, falling back down and creating probably a cold front.  Yeah.  It's a frontal system in the hat. 
[01:37:30]  Our ancestors killed animals because they were just bored.  They didn't have the internet, but they couldn't figure out to get that furriness around their  head and their ears to keep them warm.  How stupid were they?  Kennedy wore a stovepipe hat at his inauguration.  He was the last president.  So it was around until...  Nah, he was a traditional guy.  I think he was kind of like taking a page out of the...  But they did.  A lot of them did back then, still during these political hoopla pomp and circumstance events,  break out the old stovepipe hat and put it on. 
[01:38:00]  And yeah, that pretty much...  It was for show, though.  It wasn't for heat or anything like that.  It was for, you know...  What was it for?  Like, I'm a muckety-muck?  No, it was the upper class would wear that.  Oh, they would wear that?  I don't know.  I'm just saying this.  I don't know.  I remember in Oliver, like, the bums would wear it and the thieves, they wore it, too.  Well, thieves steal from the upper class.  Yeah.  I said, people were so dumb.  My mother was the dumbest.  When I was a kid, I used to take a bath.  Makes sense.  I was a...  I was a guy with... 
[01:38:30]  And I would bring the radio in.  You know, you plug in the radio.  I'm not...  I am not lying.  Okay, this explains it.  I know.  I would bring the radio into the bathroom, plug it in and listen to it, but I would sit  it right next to the...  On the bathtub.  And my mother never, ever sit...  Are you kidding me?  I swear to God, I'm not lying.  Why would I...  And...  You know, she was outside the bathroom with her fingers crossed.  She's like, come on.  I can't kill him myself, but if an accident happens...  Her ear to the door with her fingers crossed. 
[01:39:00]  That thing would have fell in.  I could have got electrocuted.  Not could have.  I would have.  No, you would have.  I would have.  Yeah, that would have been it.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  So what kind of parent lets you...  I remember doing that, though, like with a radio, because all you had was like a big  dopey radio, but I would keep it so far away from the bathtub.  You're putting it right on the edge.  It was either on the toilet next to it.  Like, God, those aren't, like, rounded and wet and slippery.  Yeah, it was the old-day bathtubs.  It was flat, you know what I mean?  Like the earth. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But see...  You sure you didn't just crank up a Victrola next to it?  She never said anything.  Good mom.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  Well, like, upside, she had fingers crossed.  Just to wrap up on the Hokey Pokey, I guess one other paragraph here.  They were having a hilarious time singing and playing games, one of which they said was a  Canadian children's game called the Cokey Cokey.  I thought to myself, wouldn't that be fun?  I guess this is the writer.  It'd be fun as a dance to cheer people up. 
[01:40:00]  So when I got back to my hotel, I wrote a chorus based on the feet and hand movements in this,  the Canadians had used with a few adaptions.  A few days later, I wrote additional lyrics to it, but kept the title Cokey Cokey.  And as everybody knows, it became a big hit.  So loosely based, obviously, on some kind of cocaine thing.  How's he going to Hokey Pokey?  So loosely.  But how's he going to be anti-Catholic?  I don't know.  I don't feel like reading further.  Do the Jewy-woo-wee?  Well, you know, you'll be doing it without your kids. 
[01:40:30]  Why?  Because they were taken away.  That was a good callback.  A little Hitler.  Oh, you know what?  Yeah, we'd like to do this break from time to time.  Just the dumb stuff we thought were good for you, or our ancestors.  We're not taking credit for their mistakes.  Kevin in Jersey, how are you, buddy?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You guys know where heroin came from, right?  Poppy seeds.  It was introduced to us by the Bear Aspirn Company. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, yeah?  That's true.  Yeah, I mean, Google that.  That's true, man.  You can find some old, like, labeling where it basically says there's heroin.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  They put it in?  Yeah, they didn't know any better.  You can buy it over the counter.  Just make it feel good, I guess?  I don't know.  Give me a couple of poems and a bottle of heroin.  Yeah, great.  Sold a lot of aspirin back then, I'm sure.  Thank you, Kevin.  Mike in Boston.  Mike.  See, there it is.  Hold on.  Bear.  Why don't you do this one, Danny?  What do you got over there?  Oh, yeah.  Look at that. 
[01:41:30]  That's kind of tough to read, but it's Bear Pharmaceutical Products.  We are now sending to physicians throughout the United States literature and samples of aspirin  substitute for blah, blah, blah, heroin.  The sedative for coughs.  Yes.  Yes.  You have a cough?  Take some heroin.  Heroin hydrochloride.  It's water-soluble salt.  You will have a call for them.  Order a supply from your jobber.  Yeah, it's hard to read, but basically it's a product by Bayer where you had the aspirin 
[01:42:00]  to help the headache and that stuff, and then the heroin helped you if you had a cough.  It certainly did.  Just pass out.  Or a bad childhood.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I didn't know.  Stuff had to come from somewhere, you know?  Had to be introduced somehow.  Shrinks were prescribing LSD in the 50s and 60s.  Well, that doesn't make you flip out even more.  Yeah.  This LSD is probably the worst thing for your mind out of all the drugs. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, this one's actually a little better.  It says heroin is preeminently adapted for the manufacture of cough elixirs, cough balsams,  cough drops, cough lozenges, and cough medicines of any kind.  One ounce package of heroin, $4.85 per ounce.  That's a lot of money, man, back then.  Acid.  That's when I was in the mental institution, when I went on the fifth floor,  because I had like an acid flashback or something.  No way.  Oh.  You were in the loony bin for a little while?  Oh, I was doing laps.  It looked like one flew over to Cuckoo's Nest.  I was there. 
[01:43:00]  Well, my friends, I was flipping.  I was losing it.  And my friends go, well, maybe he needs a vacation.  So they drove me to Florida.  We drove down.  I couldn't.  I got to go home.  So we stayed the night.  We drove back.  Then I checked in.  I never told you that?  No.  That I checked in.  And I was there, because back then, what it was was major, major anxiety.  And they didn't know back then what anxiety was.  So they gave me like Thorazine and Haldol.  These were the drugs that you gave psychotics. 
[01:43:30]  So I was, besides anxiety, I was doing like the Thorazine shuffle.  Like I would just walk in laps around the hospital, like real slow.  And I met this, there was a girl in there, and we would just do laps together.  It looked like two mummies just walking around.  And then my friend came to see me.  And it was like, I was on the fifth floor in the mental ward.  And my friend, my roommate came to see me.  And I go, I can't have company now.  We're going for a walk. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, wow.  They were taking us.  You were sad.  Oh, what do you mean?  They were taking us for a walk.  Like that was a big, big thing, because we were getting to leave the hospital and go outside.  We went for a walk.  And it looked like just ten zombies walking down the street.  Don't even get me started.  But I've been in that situation many times, being the visitor.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Never, you know.  And I once had to stop my conversation, because it was almost time for arts and crafts. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, I made a nice?  What are you kidding?  I'm like, can you finish up your conversation?  Because, you know, arts and crafts start in five minutes.  I made a little box.  A little box to put my cards in.  Wow.  You made an arts and crafts.  Yeah, I made a box.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, it was horrible.  I still, I get anxiety now.  I'm having major anxiety just talking about it.  Talking about it?  Yeah.  Oh, you're all right, Rich. 
[01:45:00]  Well, we can continue with that.  We can also go to the phones.  They're lit about drugs they didn't know any better about in the past.  And one of our favorite things to do with Rich Voss, I don't think it's old yet.  I got in my hand a pile of celebrities.  And Rich Voss is going to tell us who they are after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  I don't think I'll ever get, like, completely sick of this song.  I was going to say, for the people out there, this is one of your favorites. 
[01:45:30]  I saw you sing this a couple times over the years.  Yeah.  It is nice.  Let's say hi to Greg in Florida, and then we'll move on to other things, maybe.  Although the phones are real good right now.  What's up, Greg?  Hey.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  On my grandparents' farm, they used to have a radioactive vessel held about three gallons of water.  And we used to, as kids, we used to drink from it because it used to keep the water cool on the hot days. 
[01:46:00]  Had a big radioactive cobalt blue radioactive symbol with a lightning bolt by the word.  And it was kind of messed up.  And you drank out of this thing?  That sounds good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I'm over the years.  It disappeared.  But, yeah, we used to drink from that thing constantly.  They're old farmers, so they didn't know any better.  I think the craziest thing I did growing up, and maybe a bunch of you are out there, you break the thermometer and play with the mercury. 
[01:46:30]  No way.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that was.  Yeah.  And actually, I think, I'm trying to remember, but in school, they used to have a big thing of mercury, right?  Yeah, they had a big beaker of it.  And what was that used for?  Because you would kind of pour a little out in your hands, like, look, look how it just kind of, like, slides everywhere.  It was just how you kind of learned about liquid metal.  I think they actually allowed you to play with the mercury, so you understood what, it was a liquid metal, right?  I believe they also were teaching you how to make mercury switches for when you went to NOM. 
[01:47:00]  Here's how it works, kid.  Yeah, but I remember playing with mercury.  Yeah, yeah.  You'd try to keep it in your hand and bring it to mercury.  And don't, if you swallowed it, you were dead?  Yeah.  How much of it do you need?  Not much.  And now they're saying that those light bulbs, the CFLs, in each one of those, there's enough mercury to pollute 6,000 gallons of water.  Really?  I got those all over my house.  Yeah, they say they're...  Those spiral ones?  Yeah.  They say the knee-jerk reaction to those is going to end up polluting our groundwater in about 10 years. 
[01:47:30]  So, welcome to the new world.  But you know, I've got to change them.  They just last for a long, long time.  Yeah, I wonder what Ted, the light bulb filament guy, would say to that.  Maybe tomorrow we'll find out.  Maybe we'll find out.  Jot that down.  Yeah.  Film.  Let me see.  He only makes a couple of years.  Original 7-Up had lithium in it?  Oh, yeah?  Is that true?  We'll look that up.  And we'll screen the calls as we move on.  Rich Voss in studio. 
[01:48:00]  You're playing the Manhattan Comedy Club.  Middletown, New York.  February 67th.  Okay.  We'd like to do this bid.  Do you want to explain the bid end with the celebrity thing?  Oh, this is fantastic.  Rich Voss looks at pictures of celebrities, you know, from anything.  Entertainment, the world of the news, politics.  Sure.  And for some reason has a tough time with the names.  Rich, you're kind of known to not get people's names right. 
[01:48:30]  Right.  You know who they are.  Yeah, of course.  You know what they do, for the most part, but you just trip over the name.  I have, like, in life, I have enough stuff to worry about than celebrity names.  Like, I know.  No, no, no, no, no.  It goes beyond that.  Because I can understand.  I can understand having problems.  Like, you're busy.  You can't remember this or that or the other.  But you, you are a butcher of names. 
[01:49:00]  Just in general, you say Tortilla.  Yeah, Tortilla.  Or however the hell you say it, right?  And what was the other one?  The famous one you mispronounced?  Lean Cuisine.  Lean Cuisine.  That was it.  Lean Cuisine.  You ever have a Lean Cuisine?  See, the problem is that you guys don't miss things.  Like, in normal public, if you said, hey, you have a Lean Cuisine.  It doesn't matter if they say it or not.  They still think you're an idiot.  Oh.  They're just not being honest.  We're nicer. 
[01:49:30]  Because we're being honest with you.  You're pointing it out?  Everyone else is secretly in their head going, what adult.  Mike in New York.  There's two really good calls, and then we'll try to get to the celebrity thing.  We can't let these pass.  Go ahead, Mike.  Yeah, this is Mike from New York.  How's it going, guys?  Good, man.  Yeah, listen.  You were talking about mercury before.  I remember as a kid going to the dentist, and the dentist used to give us a little small  vial of the mercury, and we would play with it, and we would bring it home and drop 
[01:50:00]  it on the floor, and it would break into like a million pieces.  Yeah.  And then you'd push it all back together, and it would jump back together and make a  bigger piece.  Yeah, like T2000.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And no one thought this could be a problem later in life.  But I like...  No one.  Mike just had a toy test.  There was never jars of mercury in it.  Why would your dentist have...  Oh, the dentist that gave away the toys?  Yeah.  It was a little suspect of them.  It was in the fillings.  Yeah.  He used mercury in the fillings.  He knows everything.  Well, that's why... 
[01:50:30]  Stunt brain.  Stunt brain.  My pediatrician, Dr. Fuchs, if you remember, she was the one that gave me the suppository  when I was constipated at seven.  She would give us our inoculation, our little needles, and then take the syringe part off  the little...  Isn't that the pointy part?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And get...  Well, whatever.  She would just take that part off and then give us the other part with the plunger.  And then you used to suck up water in it and squirt it at each other. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  And you're just running around.  Yes, the needle part.  I'm a dummy sometimes, too.  Rich.  It's like, what is the pointy part of a needle called?  The needle?  Yes.  The needle.  Yeah, but they used to hand that out.  And then...  I remember that, yeah.  I remember one time when I got a little older and she gave me a needle.  I was like, oh, can I have that?  She goes, well, it's against the law.  Can't hand these out.  They discovered AIDS.  It's a man at my work.  They discovered AIDS.  Oh, that was before AIDS.  Okay.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:51:30]  Let's go to Pittsburgh.  Tim?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Polio or something was all over it.  All these stories have a common theme.  They all started out when I was little.  What were our parents thinking?  But when I was little, we used to play in the summer in this, what we thought was a strip  mine.  Well, the next summer, we find out that it's this thing called a Superfund site where it  was a nuclear dump.  And Reagan had come in and over the winter, they had put in these six feet concrete barriers 
[01:52:00]  and buried all this stuff that we've been playing in for years.  Wow.  Oh, my gosh.  That's a good one.  How do you sleep in there?  None of us have birth defects.  We all went on to have successful careers.  Two-headed kids.  I don't know.  It's going to be your kids' kids.  You know that, right?  It's your kids, Marty.  Three years and two heads, like the two-headed baby.  Wow. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, yeah, the monster.  Yeah, the monster from yesterday.  A lot of people checked out that video.  It was terrific.  All right, Tim.  Thank you, man.  Watch it out.  And that leads to John New Rochelle.  We're off and running here.  Go ahead, John.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hi, John.  My parents had a house in New Rochelle that was built around the turn of the century, around  1909.  And my brother and I used to go in the basement, take these pipe covers off.  Anthony can appreciate this.  They were made of asbestos.  Oh, yeah.  And they were held on by little brass straps.  We used to beat each other with some sword fights, and the place would just be a cloud 
[01:53:00]  of white asbestos stuff.  To the basement.  Oh, man.  Big mesothelioma fight.  They're not kidding.  And nowadays, you have to pay to have that stuff taken away because it's so toxic.  Oh, yeah.  They put a pressurized system in so none of it gets out of the work area.  You can't even get near the place without respirators.  How great is the visual, though? 
[01:53:30]  These guys are beating each other with it.  And just the dust.  Breathing it all in.  Class-action lawsuits around the country for people from dying from asbestos.  Oh, that's funny, John.  Thank you.  Wow.  Here's a regular to the radio show and, of course, also a regular at F.H. Riley's.  In the heart of Huntington Village, 400 New York Avenue, my brother's fine restaurant.  Super Bowl party there?  Looking good, yeah.  Looking good. 
[01:54:00]  We might do a Super Bowl party at F.H. Riley's.  What's up, Perel guy?  How are you guys today?  Pretty good, man.  I got a beauty.  Yeah.  When I was two years old, they gave me radiation, the doctor, to shrink my adenoids,  the console area of the adenoids.  Yeah.  Fifty years later, I've had a pituitary adenoma.  They took out my pituitary gland, all from the radiation.  I've had thyroid cancer because of the radiation.  I've had a parotidectomy.  They took out my parotid gland, which is your, you know, your little... 
[01:54:30]  Wait, wait.  It gets better.  It gets better.  It gets better.  Ready?  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah.  Played golf.  I had a shoulder injury.  They took an MRI.  They found a little something on the bone.  Normally, they say, forget about it.  Because I had cancer.  They had to do a phone biopsy.  I've had four operations.  I'm like a bionic...  Bionic...  Wow.  No wonder you sell Purell. 
[01:55:00]  This is very common in New York and Chicago.  The doctor almost killed me.  I'm like ducking death out.  It's crazy.  Note to self, never shake Purell guy's hand.  Wow.  No, no, no.  I'm okay, man.  Just as soon as they don't want the radiation into that show.  I glow in the dark, too.  See, you know what?  Thank God my father wasn't a complete idiot.  I went to the doctor when I was a kid out in California because I had like cystic acne.  It was just the worst. 
[01:55:30]  And this doctor, old Doc Esslinger, he goes, you know what?  Fix that right up.  X-ray therapy.  X-ray therapy.  He was going to stick my head under an X-ray machine and just radiate my face.  Oh, my God.  And my father, in his infinite wisdom, just said, aunt, let's go grab a beer.  And just get out of here because this guy is going to kill you.  He wasn't worried about your safety.  He was just jonesing for a beer.  You know that.  Which ended up saving your life. 
[01:56:00]  Yes.  That's good.  Thank God.  Your father made a good source.  I'll tell you one.  My mother-in-law had acne on her chest and they gave her radiation years and years ago.  Breast cancer.  So that's right.  He made a great choice by getting you the hell out of there.  All right.  Thank you, Buzzkill.  We'll see you later.  X-ray therapy.  This one.  Take X-rays.  Tight, tight, tight, tight, tight.  Look at her bone.  X-ray your face to get rid of zits.  Speaking of X-rays, this next call, I might laugh so hard.  I might just puke from laughing. 
[01:56:30]  Go ahead, Jeremy.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  What's up?  Think about the X-ray thing.  It reminded me back in the day when me and my friends broke into this old clinic that  they were moving out.  And they had one of the old-time X-ray machines that spit out the film.  I mean, we didn't know to wear lead vests at the time.  So we were sitting there taking pictures of each other to X-rays.  Just total radiation.  Not even thinking about the harm it could cause.  I should just say that I turned out all right, man.  No extra limbs and none of that stuff.  So I haven't had kids yet. 
[01:57:00]  So I don't know the full impact.  Just taking turns, X-raying the color without lead vests.  We took about 50 pictures, too, if I remember.  We took them home to my parents.  That's funny, bro.  Watch out, guys.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Adam in Kansas City.  Possibly the new home of the New York Islanders.  There's rumors of flying.  What's up there, Adam?  Hey, we were kids.  The cider company came out and ripped off some of the S-bester shingles off the side. 
[01:57:30]  I had a house to put up a new vinyl.  And so we thought it was a good idea to go out there and play karate  and practice confu, busting these hard asbestos shingles over it.  Yeah, they used to have the asbestos shingles.  Those are still on a lot of houses.  I've had kids since then, and they just seemed like nothing's wrong.  You know, just thinking back, it's like that house, the old house of ours,  it's covered with asbestos stuff.  I sit there, scratch off the walls,  trying to stupid kid thinking that there's some baseball cards  sitting inside the cavities of the wall  where it's scraping the asbestos off the lead pipes and everything. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, I actually was asked to remove some asbestos from some basement  that I was supposed to do a tin-knocking job in.  And I told my boss, I go, no, I'm not touching that.  They go, oh, it's a little bit.  Don't be a...  And then, you know, he called me the P-word.  And I was like, no.  He goes, but we got masks,  like those dust masks that you use if your labor is sweeping the floor.  He said, get out of here.  And I refused to do it. 
[01:58:30]  Refused.  Wow.  Yeah, we did the shoe store x-ray machine thing.  How about we go to Sean in Georgia?  Sean, what do you got for the show?  Hey, man.  Hey, my dad used to tell me stories about when he used to work in an iron mill,  and his job was to walk across the catwalk  and push the trash back down into the iron  to get it to keep melting the floor to the top.  And to do that, to be able to stand in the heat,  they used to have to wear a full-body suit  that was insulated with asbestos.  Because apparently that was the best thing to use for something in that situation. 
[01:59:00]  That's what killed Steve McQueen.  He was a race car driver, did a lot of his own stunts and stuff,  and the suit that he wore was asbestos,  the old asbestos fire suits that he wore doing his own stunts and everything,  and that wound up giving him the mesothelioma.  Get out of here.  How many times did you wear it?  We used to sleep under asbestos blankets, my parents did.  What?  Oh, my God.  I didn't know.  That's for you?  Why not?  That's not an odd thing. 
[01:59:30]  Right.  When you tell a story, you can say anything,  and I'll believe it because of what you've said.  Running out of show on this side.  No.  Well, they're screening the calls.  We'll go back to the calls in a second here.  We multitask on the show.  They do have asbestos blankets, though, by the way.  They like fire blankets that they used to put out.  We got photos of celebrities for Rich Voss.  Yes.  Hopefully this bit still has legs.  This bit's the snuggie.  Imagine. 
[02:00:00]  The first one we're going to show, Rich, he was in Horace Gump.  Yes.  Not Tom Hanks.  Apollo 13.  Apollo 13.  What TV show?  The CSI.  He's the CSI guy.  Stephen King's The Stand.  Very good.  Rich Voss, who is this famous actor?  That's easy, man.  You start off with an easy one.  Gary Sinise.  Oh.  All right.  All right, Rich.  Feeling confident, are you?  That's one.  I feel like a little kid that did something good. 
[02:00:30]  You are.  That's exactly what you just did.  The main dude from Entourage.  Oh, how would I know that?  I can't even tell you who that is.  Is he getting fat?  This is how gay is that.  Pretty gay.  You're right, Rich.  I'm not going to.  Oh, my God.  Look at him.  I think he is.  I wouldn't know.  What's his first name?  I don't even know.  I couldn't tell you what that guy's name is.  What the hell is his name, Danny?  That's Adrian Cranor.  Oh, wow.  No one knows that.  Awkward.  Well, it's only a huge hit show on HBO. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  I know.  Not one I watch.  It's not like he's written up on the gossip sites every day or anything.  Oh, he looks familiar.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy, never.  Never in a million years.  The main dude from House, right?  No.  That guy used to be in Millennium.  Oh, this is the guy from...  He's in Aliens.  No, we had him in the studio.  Bishop.  No, we never had him in.  I would cry myself.  Oh, he looks like the freaking other guy with the one you loved from those movies. 
[02:01:30]  F.  Forget it.  F.  No, if he ever came in, that would be great.  Sully, we need you, Sully.  Sully, we're going in.  We're going in, Sully.  What was his first name?  I'm completely lost.  I'm losing my mind today.  Lance.  Huh?  Lance.  Oh.  Lance.  H.  H.  H.  H.  H.  H. 
[02:02:00]  Handover.  Yes.  I just made it up.  Lance Hendrickson.  Hendrickson.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know that.  All right, how about this?  Give me one I know.  No one's known any of them.  He's in the new movie.  The trailer looks terrific for Taken.  The star of Taken coming out in a few more weeks.  Oh, that's Liam.  Liam.  Liam, Liam.  Liam, uh, Nielsen.  No.  There it is.  Liam Nielsen.  All right, well, there's one.  All right, we finally got one out of them. 
[02:02:30]  The bit now has a passing grade.  Barely, but, uh.  Liam Nielsen.  Nielsen.  Very good.  That's right.  Nielsen.  How about one of the stars of, uh.  Uh, yes, the Green Mile.  Mm-hmm.  John Coffey.  Oh, yeah.  What's his first name?  The big black guy.  The big black bald guy.  What's his first name?  Michael.  Oh.  Michael, give me a initial on his last name, the first initial. 
[02:03:00]  I kind of remember it.  It's got three names.  Michael, uh.  Ooh.  Michael, uh, uh, uh.  Uh.  Oh, man.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Goddamn Fred from Brooklyn.  What?  That was a good one.  I can't say it.  It's so bad.  But it's funny as hell.  What's the initial on the first, on the middle name?  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:03:30]  It's not.  I can't think of it.  Michael something.  Uh, Michael.  It's not Michael.  Michael Joe.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, I know.  Oh, my God.  Holy Christ.  Fred from Brooklyn.  Oh, that's funny.  Michael Duncan, uh, something.  Michael Duncan.  I just drooled.  Uh.  You're right there.  Let's go.  Michael Duncan.  There's a middle name in there.  Oh, I thought that was his middle name. 
[02:04:00]  No.  Michael Sam Duncan.  Michael, uh.  Michael.  Michael.  Michael Duncan, yo, yo.  Michael.  Duncan Donuts.  I don't know.  Duncan Donuts.  Michael, uh, Duncan.  Duncan.  Duncan.  Duncan.  God, I wish Barney was here.  She knows all this stuff.  All this stuff.  She doesn't.  All right.  That's very good.  You got that one right.  How about, uh, this guy died recently from, uh, Fantasy Island.  Oh.

[02:08:30]  Yeah  You are dumber than  Than S  Crap  All right  Wow  Yeah  It's like a documentary, that last call  Bad story  It's horrible  And topped off with a  Curse  Curses  Well, look, it's Ron Howard  What's he talking about?  Maybe he's asking for his Twitter name  Oh, no, don't ask for it  You know?  Yeah, but I don't have it yet  I got Opie Radio on Twitter  And I want Opie, but someone has it 
[02:09:00]  He could take any Opie name he wants  I understand  If he wants Opie Radio, I'll give it to him  But right now, it's mine  Opie's acknowledged the fact that he is  The second  Second most famous Opie  Yeah, there's a lot of Opie's out there  I understand that  But  There's Ron Howard has to take president  So if he wants my Twitter thing, I'll give it to him  Opie Radio  I'll continue interacting with the listeners  After the show  Up until Ron Howard takes the Twitter  Yeah  And then it'll be boring movie talk 
[02:09:30]  And hat talk  Award nominations, that's why he's on TV  Yeah, they just did the Oscar noms  And he's up again  And Frost Nixon  And the rest of the way  Frost Nixon  He did Frost Nixon?

[02:11:00]  It was douche-chillingly embarrassing  Yeah  And I was watching that  And that kind of reminded me  Because they showed Bill May  I was like  Or whatever his name is  What, Eric?  That guy  The little robot guy  I'll have to go check that out  And here's a quickie  Mark McGuire's younger brother  What a douche  Really?  What a douche  He's shopping a book  Mark McGuire's brother  And basically saying  Yeah, my brother definitely did steroids  I introduced my brother to steroids 
[02:11:30]  I want to make sure I get that right  Because this is a bit controversial today  Wow  What a douche  Sellout  I'm sure he did very well  Because of Mark McGuire's fame  And fortune  How desperate do you  Need to be famous  Where now you're shopping a book  And calling your brother out like that  That is low  Man  He's just selling them out for cash  Because he's not going to make up  He's doing it for cash  Why doesn't he just call his brother  And go give me some money

That's a good thing  Gave you a little of my knowledge  You learned something  It's called a stand-alone  Yeah, stand-alone  You've got to believe  That a lot of listeners  Are right there with you  And you can just, like, play something  And they understand exactly what's going on  They make the jokes by themselves  In their cars, at home, wherever they're listening 
[02:13:00]  They don't need us at that point  That's why it's stand-alone  You know what?  It's worth playing again, too  It's certainly  I want to hear it  One more time  The Obama's very lovey-dovey  During that whole inauguration thing  And they had some kind of love expert on in Detroit  Where it's so cold in the D  Local TV  And this broad had this to say  About the lovey-dovey Obama's  We also need to be affectionate  And you can see that with Barack and Michelle as well  They do a lot of touching, kissing, even fisting with one another 
[02:13:30]  And that is so very important  Because couples really need to feel like they're physically bonded to one another  Wow, how do you tell my wife?  What?  See, my wife  Now she knows  She's getting that lecture tonight  You need to do the fist bump  Yeah, the fist bump  The bump  Yes  I kind of like that  And what the hell, because it's right here in front of us  Sam took that audio  I think it's worth another play today 
[02:14:00]  One more  A couple beeps and wow, it gets very outrageous  We also need to be affectionate  And you can see that with Barack and Michelle as well  They do a lot of f***ing, f***ing, even fisting  And that is so very important  Because couples really need to feel like they're f***ing one another  Yes, they do  With that, we'll see you tomorrow  Later, man  Thanks  Hey, I loved you in Mary Poppins, by the way

[02:20:00]  There's another story in the paper that maybe you could comment on there, sir  Yes  Little Rock, Arkansas  A man used a cigarette lighter to peer inside a gasoline can  Setting off a fire that destroyed a mobile home and critically burned a friend  Oh, you never use lighters in a can  That's silly  All kinds of gases are built up  Don't you know  You can shoot things right out of there  Did you ever hear about the gerbil? 
[02:20:30]  Yes  Scented flaming into someone's face  In retrospect, lighting the match was not a good idea  Yeah, that one  I think we all have received that email by now  True story  Well, yeah, he had this cigarette lighter  He was peering inside a can  And he ignited the fumes that were escaping the can  And once he ignited the fumes  He dropped the can  He slung it  And threw it on the floor  Oh, that bruise  That sounds like fun 
[02:21:00]  He suffered minor burns on his hand  I love cans  Okay, thank you  Sure  All right  We'll be back  Stay there  All right  Anthony, in between shows  I took a little twit pic 
[02:21:30]  Did you?  And sent it to my followers  OP Radio on Twitter  And I wrote  Might be a little late to start the second half of the show  And then I wrote  Ugg to Chili  Oh, oh, okay  It was a picture of just my knees  No, you took a picture from the crapper  Yeah  And there was a nice picture of the Obamas  On the floor for inspiration, I guess  I don't know  Oh, like the newspaper was down there?  Happy to be there  I did not set up that shot 
[02:22:00]  I swear to you  Of course not  But the other reason I bring that up is  I had the place to myself last night  Because my girl's going back to school  Aww  And she's going to finish the  Nah, I was going to go with a high school joke  But  Sully saved me  Thank God  Sully  Sully can land anything  Sully can land anything  Sully can land anything  Right on my shoulder  But I told you  The History Channel  Because of you  I'm watching more and more 
[02:22:30]  Oh, it's great  And I love President crap  Yeah  I love watching stuff on the presidents  And you were telling me about Lincoln  Yeah, they had a good Lincoln one  I don't think we mentioned this on the air  But you said  That they showed actual pictures of Lincoln  Yeah, photos  Where he was being sworn in  Pretty much just like Obama  You know, the hairstyles and the clothes were different  Yeah  And it was a black and white photo  But besides that  It was pretty much the same setup  The street  You know  It's horse and carriages  But yeah 
[02:23:00]  Like the same  Same buildings  Right  You know, you saw a lot of the same buildings  So  I was  Because of that  I searched out the presidents  And I got to see like  I got to see FDR last night  And Taft  That was a good one  Who was our fattest president  Taft  And who else  Teddy Roosevelt  Yeah  Good one  Who else was in the middle there?  McKinley, right?  Yeah, McKinley  McKinley  Old, it's only a flesh wound McKinley  Wow 
[02:23:30]  You know how that guy did it?  Oh  A bandaged hand?  Yeah  Come a long way  They're looking for that kind of stuff nowadays  Yeah  He walked up to say hi to the president  He had a bandaged hand  No one thought twice  And there was a gun inside the bandage or something  Killed him in Buffalo  And because I was part of a morning show back then  We actually broadcasted from the exact spot where he bought it  He killed him  If you're in Buffalo, you got to go check it out  Now I think it's like some kind of 7-Eleven parking lot or something 
[02:24:00]  Yeah  Maybe one of the Buffalo listeners could tell me because it's been a while  President McKinley  Oh yeah  Yeah  Yeah  So I'm watching the presidents just having a night to myself  Had some chili earlier in the day  And boy, how long does it take chili to stew?  Like 4 hours, 5 hours?  Starts percolating  Dude, when I tell you the farts were beyond horrendous, right?  And I'm kind of wrapped up on the couch watching the presidents  Oh no  And my girl's really, really nice, soft blanket 
[02:24:30]  Oh no, so it's just soaking it in  Like a sham wow for farts  You ever fart so bad that you're embarrassed and you're the only one in the room?  For real  Like you're completely embarrassed  You know no one is even around to smell this thing  It's good when that happens though because then you know how bad it is  So if you're around somebody, you don't do that  You ever do it so bad you have to check?  No, these are those  Hot air  Yeah, thank you, Ant  The poofy hot air ones 
[02:25:00]  Where I knew it  I knew it was so bad that I was wearing my sweatpants  My brand new ones, by the way  I had to get rid of the old ones  And I would like lean to the side  And then I would like pull the sweatpants away  To give some room between  All right, you were enjoying them  No, I was like, I was trying to protect my sweatpants  Oh  So I'm sitting there and I'm wrapping up the presidents  And my girl comes in the front door  And all hell broke loose 
[02:25:30]  Immediately  What the hell have you been doing the last two hours?  Are you kidding?  And she walked in and knew immediately  Right  You'd gas the entire place out  And it screams  And you're using my blanket  How could you do this?  How am I supposed to do?  I don't know  Have some decorum  Dude, I live in an apartment  Like you live in a house  So I understand  Like when I used to live in a house  When I was like that  You go outside  Every few minutes  Why not?

Oh my god  You guys are doomed  Yeah, you're doomed  That makes you doomed? 
[02:26:30]  Doomed  Does that make you closer?  No  No  Any expert would tell you  The best thing to do  If you're in a relationship  Is to get separate bathrooms  Oh, we do  Yeah, well we talked about that  Start there  But, uh  No, and I'm not even joking  I have no idea when my girl  You know  Dumps  No clue  I have no idea  No idea  And she's eating the same spicy crap I am  And I'm having a major issue  I can't, like, keep that airing  She's taking, uh, her time  Probably taking the pain 
[02:27:00]  Mm-hmm  And everything  Just to make sure  You don't have to go through that  And it's a, it's a, it's a true story  Because I did try to do the right thing  Not last night  Uh, because I'm like  Yeah, obviously this is not good  For a relationship  To be stinking up  The entire room  She, she smelled  As soon as she walked in the door  And she had a nice walk  To get, get to where I was at  Nice, crisp, uh, fresh  Cold air outside  To really cleanse  The, um, receptors  In your nostrils  And then you walk in that room  Yeah  Oh, it just nails you in the face

[02:33:30]  Jimmy Fallon bit yesterday  Get the fuck out of here  Really  And then came back  Oh yeah  Actually I  Got word from the Philly crew  They called like  From all their jobs  Like what the fuck  Hmm  That's the first time  Unless the channel went out  And it went to the backup loop  That's the only thing I know  I bet somebody  It's just  Didn't like the material  And just flipped the space  Well that's what we're wondering  Because it's  You know  Conspiracy theory time  But I mean  That  You know  And ranting and raving about  That's the first  That's the first I'm hearing of it too  I didn't cut 
[02:34:00]  Anything out  No I wouldn't think anyone would cut it  But it's probably  It definitely happened  Trust me  That is a definite  It could just be anybody  That didn't like what they heard  And decided  Eh  I'm gonna just  Well I mean  Or it could just be the channel  This channel has had a few problems  In recent weeks  So  You know  If the connection between here and DC  Does crap out  And it has  There's like these backup  Bits that they default to  That are in DC  So that potentially could have been one of them  We'll find out  And people saying the timing  Was a little  A little 
[02:34:30]  A little suspect  A little suspect  Hey  We just said  Try the chocolate thing with the dog  Well we got a vet  He was panicking  He called up immediately  James in Connecticut  Hey how's it going fellas  Hey  Hey I'm a veterinarian  And chocolate is toxic to dogs  And I work emergency service  And there's nothing more of a pain in the ass  Than the day after Halloween  Because dogs will just find all that stash  And go through it  And it'll come in  And yeah  If they get a little bit  Diarrhea happens  They get a little bit more 
[02:35:00]  Their heart races  I mean it goes over 200 beats per minute  They get even more than that  They could have seizures and die  So we probably shouldn't try the chocolate thing with the dogs right  No  I would discourage people from doing that  Because that's going to lead to a lot of problems  Maybe they give that to Ted Kennedy  A little too much chocolate  He has a little seizure  How's he doing?  I guess as fine as you can with a brain tumor  I'm amazed he's still alive  I'm just amazed  Because he's a Kennedy  He was on public 
[02:35:30]  Friggin funded  Welfare health care  Like Obama wants to put in  He'd be dead already  Garen fucking teed  He wouldn't be able to use that Kennedy money  To get the best doctors  He'd be waiting on line  Whatever  You know  Be like everybody else  Socialize medicine  And see what happens there  Teddy  You'd be in the fucking ground already  Rotten  Dude that's such a celebrity thing too  I mean the classic one was  Was it Mickey Mantle? 
[02:36:00]  With the new liver?  With his liver  Fucking drunk  Fucking drunk  His liver went out  Because he was a drunk  He gets a new liver  And he fucking almost wears that one out  Almost  He went  He didn't last too much longer  After the liver  I mean that was a nice liver for somebody  Someone else could have used that liver  This just in  John Boy and Billy in North Carolina  We love E-Rock selection  So okay that's good  Oh boy  Great  A little radio abuse there  The nominees for the Oscars are out  I wasn't going to do this list

[02:39:00]  The James Bond guy in it  Yeah  That's a Holocaust movie?  I didn't see it  Did you know what?  Oh yeah  Yeah  It's like about the Jews  That actually  Went into the woods  And then actually fought  The Germans  Some of the Jews  That actually fought  It's a cast of three  That's what I was going to say  It was a fourth  No they  And it's a true story  They you know  Kind of went in there  And got a bunch of Jews with them  And then went out  On these little raids  Like the Wolverines 
[02:39:30]  In Red Dawn  Oh  Yeah you know  They kind of went out  Killed some Nazis  Are you ready for the synopsis  Of The Reader?  Yeah let me hear  What this fucking drivel is about  The Reader opens in post  World War II Germany  Alright so it's not a Holocaust movie  When teenager Michael Berg  Becomes ill  And is helped home by Hannah  A stranger twice his age  Michael recovers from scarlet fever  And seeks out Hannah to thank her  The two are quickly drawn into a passionate 
[02:40:00]  But secretive affair  Michael discovers that Hannah loves being read to  And their physical relationship deepens  Holy shit  This sounds like the worst movie ever made  What planet is this movie being shown on?  Their relationship deepens  Hannah is enthralled  As Michael reads to her from  The Odyssey  Huck Finn 
[02:40:30]  And the lady with the little dog  Dude does this sound like a fucking movie  Anyone wants to see?  Chicks probably  And take a fucking spade shovel  And just dig your genitals out  If you go to this fucking movie  If some fucking cunt  Drags you to this fucking movie  Take a post hole digger to your cock  Despite their intense bond  It continues  Hannah mysteriously disappears one day  And Michael is left confused and heartbroken  What? I fell asleep during the synopsis 
[02:41:00]  I found a speedy  Holy shit  Yeah  Eight years later  While Michael is a law student  How many years?  Eight  And the movie's in real time by the way  All right  Observing the Nazi war crime trials  Huh  He is stunned to find Hannah back in his life  How? Why?  Well Anthony  This time as a defendant in the courtroom  No way  She's up for Nazi war crimes?  Yes  What did she do?  Well you have to watch the movie to find out  Now I'm captivated  As Hannah's past  Oh I mean bored shitless 
[02:41:30]  How did I mix those two up?  Well  As Hannah's past is revealed  Michael uncovers a deep secret  That will impact both of their lives  Ah  The reader is a story about truth and re-re-reconciliation  About how one generation comes to terms with the crimes of another  Well she'd probably  Are you ready to laugh?  How horrible  That  Do we have to  I wonder if you got to sit through scenes 
[02:42:00]  Of watching him reading to her  Of course you do  I know feeling jealous  Like just sitting there reading  And she's laying down  Of course  Like what's the scene?  He's got a book open  Is the camera moving kind of around  And she's just all wide eyed  And he's reading  I'm gonna guess it's like a nice summer day  They're under a tree  Yeah yeah that's gotta be one of them  Little picnic basket  It's winter in another scene maybe  And he's reading from the Odyssey  In a fire  There's a fireplace going  Read fast 
[02:42:30]  And this Nazi bitch is fucking  Just trying to hide some secrets  Read harder  Yeah you read that book  You read  You read that book you fucking  Yeah  Someone say it's a soft core porno  Come on Matt  Matt what are you doing to us?

[02:44:00]  I wouldn't uh  I wouldn't say  It's uh  Best movie of the year  I think Mickey Rourke  Was uh  Exceptional in the  In the  In the story  Yeah  And you're right man  Revolutionary Road  Was fucking  Hell  I can't believe  It was a Sam Mendes movie  I mean the guy made  Some great movies  Revolutionary Road  Stoked  Dude I don't know what we did  Like we went to the theater  I mean a lot of us do this  You go to the theater  Hoping to see something  It's sold out  And then you  Then it's just potluck  I don't know  And we went into  Revolutionary Road

[03:23:30]  And you know  Throw down real quick  And put a finger  In her ass  Or something  Which I've never done  How can you be married  To somebody  And never  I don't mind her  Putting fingers  In my ass  You know  She's just asking  For a back rub  Yeah  You're ready to  Fucking bowling ball  The chick  Trying to finger  Pop her ass  She's just  She's got a little  Tension  Yeah  Needs a back massage  But I have been  Giving her massages  While we lay in bed  I'm trying to be  A little more romantic  I'll put my hand  Under the blanket  And you know  I'll touch her and shit

[03:24:30]  Like you're some  Crazy oil tycoon  And there's a reason  Why she would stay  With you  If she's not into it  That's exactly  What I keep saying  Thank you  Yeah  If she wasn't into it  What's keeping her  Yeah she would just leave  Huh  She would be so gone  No way  I mean I don't know  No  She loves you  Yeah I love her too  I love her  Go home and get back in there  Rich  Get back in there  Yeah start  Fucking  It's not about just fucking

[03:25:30]  To fucking booze sometimes  I think Rich could start drinking again  If Rich was drunk  He would just be ravaging you  Doing all kinds of dirty shit  He's embarrassed about in the morning  Oh no  When Bonnie drinks  It's you know  We  You know she has a couple wines  Yeah but you  If you were drinking too  Then it would be you know  Then you would leave to get cocaine  I know  Then I'd sell her watch  Wait I want to hear about  The Bonnie drinking some wines  Yeah  Because she gets  She gets a little frisky 
[03:26:00]  When she has wine  A little frisky  She's like  She's fucking 60  Occasionally when I've been drinking  What's that  The car gets pulled over  Occasionally  Yeah  Ah  See  There you go  That was three years ago  She gets pulled over  Occasionally  If you  If an occasion  Is a decade  Okay  Occasionally  It happened one time  In a hotel  Because you had to pee first  I said what the fuck  Why don't you blow me  While you're peeing  Okay  Shut the fuck up  Occasionally  Oh now he's being funny 
[03:26:30]  See  No  No but  See cause  Here's the thing  With Bonnie and I  We're meant for each other  You know what makes  Rich really funny  Like when he's backed  Into a corner  You know like  Yeah  And he has to just  Lash out at everything  Yeah that's his  His defense  See it's like  It's like watching Oprah now  She comes up  She's like Dr. Bonnie  She's  She  Like when I first met her  I used to help her out  She was Dr. Kevorkian

[03:29:30]  With the other guys  Yeah  So  She doesn't pick me up  And then all of a sudden  My friend Charlie  Calls me and says  I think  I was over at your old place  And Stacy was over there  My old place  My old roommate  So I go to the house  And the door's locked  And the doors are never locked  Oh  Right  Jesus Christ  So I climb up  On the fucking roof  And I peek through the window  And I see her laying on the bed  With my best friend  But they're not fucking  But she's rubbing his chest  It's after they fuck  Oh no 
[03:30:00]  That's even worse  Basking in the afterglow  At least if they were fucking  I could have sat on the roof  And jerked off  Maybe  Right  Right  So  Well the rubbing of the chest  Now you know  It's not just like  Having sex  There's some  Just like fucking  Romance  You know  It wasn't  They're laying in  In my old room  Dude what'd you do  I smashed a window  And glass blue  Cut under his eye  You know  I mean we're friends  I talk to him every once in a while  Of course you  You still hang out  With your ex-wife  When you look in there 
[03:30:30]  And saw that  Were you just like  Fuck  This is the first girl  I ever really fell in love with  I mean I was devastated  I went home  I took all her clothes  And threw them on the porch  Or out in the yard  I was like  I felt like  You know  Waiting to exhale  Some fucking black chick  From waiting to exhale  I'm surprised  I didn't go burn her clothes  In her car  Even though she didn't have a car  It was my car  It will happen  It will happen  It will happen  That will happen sometimes  Oh  So  You know  I was devastated  So  You know  And then she started seeing him  I mean  It's the first time 
[03:31:00]  My mother ever talked to me  Came over and talked to me  You know  Oh it's okay  You know  These things happen  Yeah to you  Dad left you  Doesn't mean I have to be left  Right  So  Older you  For a little Richie Voss  I guess I was like  22 or something  You know  21  22  I had my own business  Or whatever  So  And  Drug dealing isn't considered  No that's why  I used to remodel houses  But I fucking  That's called burglary  Remodel houses  Let me remove this  No 
[03:31:30]  So then  Fucking you know  And then  She started seeing him  We broke up  Whatever  And I  Fuck whoever  Just to try to  Cover the pain  But then  I picked her up at the bar  And she goes  Oh  I miss you  So I  You know  I go come back  Oh  And so I fucked her  And right after I fucked her  I called him  And go  Guess who I just fucked  And I said  Get out  And I  Wow  A little revenge  Yeah I think I caught the clap  No I  He goes  Yeah  You think you're getting back  At me motherfucker  No  But you know  That's all  Welcome to the wonderful world of AIDS 
[03:32:00]  But if you think about it  You know  When you're  I'm 21  22  She's 20  We're so young back then  And you don't know  You know  It's not like  Adult  But  Then the war broke out  So  You know  And then  As your mother  As a kid  Here's the fucking real deal  And then you can wrap it up  When you're a little kid  And your mother  Takes you  To your grandmother's house  On your father's side  Takes you  Brings you to the front door 
[03:32:30]  Wait let me get my cock out  Rings the door  Rings the doorbell  And goes  Take them  I don't want them  You have abandoned issues  And you don't trust females  Okay  That's where the trust  To a female  The untrust towards females  Come from  When your mother  Pushes you  And says  I don't want them  No I don't understand about that  That's such a selfish thing  To do obviously  But it's like  Why couldn't she do it  Another way  Without you hearing that  Yeah  Because then maybe  In your little mind  You would be able to  Wrap yourself around  And go okay  She's just going out tonight 
[03:33:00]  And we're going to grandma's  But whatever  And you're never coming home again  So that's why  You don't trust women  That's it  That's a rough one man  You know  As a fucking little  I don't want them  That's why you don't  Trust women  Yeah  Yeah  Oh why don't you  Trust them  I trust women  Really  Yeah I really do  You ever fucking  From behind  And go through your wallet  No  That's because you're so drunk  You don't know  You fucking idiot  You'll see the lawyers 
[03:33:30]  Are fucking me from behind  Going through my wallet  But so  It's deeper  Than  It's just the trust  Towards fucking women  Well now  It makes sense  Wow yeah  That makes sense  When you're deposited  At your grandma's  I was a little fucking kid  Aw  Little rich  Well I'll drive you  Into New York  To see your dad  You get there  And the fucking cops  Arrest him  Thank you  I'm the decoy  No  You were the decoy  Yeah  My father  You know  They do that with TV sets  Yeah they used to  Hey look what you won  Yeah 
[03:34:00]  He used to take us in  To fucking New York  To Port Authority  You're gonna meet your dad  At the Port Authority  And we get on the bus  My mother would take us in  We get there to see my dad  As we go to walk over to dad  Cops come and fucking  Arrest him  Why don't you  Point at your daddy  When you get off  The bus  Point at him  And take your little hat off  And put the cigarette out  Wait a minute  Why was he being arrested  For child support issues  They were both fucked up  Yeah  Child's queen  I don't 
[03:34:30]  Why the fuck put the kids  In the middle of that shit  That's why  Some of that stuff  Happened with Ann too  That's why my ex-wife  And I get along great  I didn't do that to my kids  I did just the opposite  You know what I mean  To make you a better father  You think  Yeah  Well I  Yeah  They yelled  My parents yelled at each other  Well yeah  They loved us  I knew that  Yeah I should have  Walked you into that  But they hated each other  Yeah but you're  So  Which I guess would be hard  To kind of hide  Yeah but his family  His is more fucked up though  His dad used to make them 
[03:35:00]  Shower together  At least we  No that was just teaching  It was one time  Yeah he was just teaching  He had to tell back to the courts  I started crying  Because I thought he was peeing  But it was just the water  Running off  You know how  If you stand in the shower  The water runs off you  And it runs off the tip of your dick  In a stream  If you just stand there  And if you're  If you're a little guy  So I was kind of  Yeah  It would kind of get the feeling  Of you just hanging out  Under a waterfall  It's like the shower  Yeah  So I didn't want to go near him  Because I was like no 
[03:35:30]  And he was like  No god damn it  I'm just you know  You're old enough to shower now  You don't have to  You know  Take a bath anymore  What are the odds  That you and your brother  Are old enough  At the same time to shower  We're only like 18 months apart  Oh really  Yeah  But it was at the point  Where it's like  You know something  Let me just take fucking baths  For a little while  Hey let me ask you this  Like now that you're older  Did you find that weird  Oh yeah  It's  Oh fuck yeah  That was  I think you know  He was just tanked  And thought  I'm gonna teach my kids  How to fucking shower 
[03:36:00]  Yeah  But it's like hippie stuff  Yeah maybe  He wasn't really a hippie  But  No no  He was the furthest thing  From a fucking hippie  He hated the hippies  Yeah but he was like  A free spirit  It was like a cowboy  Or something  Wannabe  And cowboy in New York  And then a cowboy  When he got to California  But this was all New York shit  Like when he was just  All fucked up  I just figured out  To trust if she's not  Like I go  My mother's in  And she's fucking  On her way out  And it's so weird  Like that  The feeling  You know  It's like  It's almost like 
[03:36:30]  No feelings  I can't  It's just like  No feelings  You better resolve that shit  But I  No I went in there  I said I love you  And I said to her  I go I'm sorry  For all the pain  I put you through in life  When I was doing drugs  And you put a pillow  Over her face  And squeezed it  Yeah but you know what  That gets  That takes  Maybe you were doing  All those drugs  Because of what she did  To you when you were younger  But whatever  I cleared my conscience  Right  I you know  I apologize for what  I've done wrong  Because you know  I did  I was a fucked up kid too  After 
[03:37:00]  How could you not be  Oh of course  You were excited  To see your dad  In there  Using a decoy  You're fucking big  What the fuck  How old were you  Huh  How old  Like 32  8, 9  7, 8, 9  7  Oh my god  First or second grade  Wow  So who was there  To take you guys  After you were used  As a decoy  Oh she just  Put us back on the bus  And took us home  Uh huh  Teach you a lesson  Your father's no good  For real  And then you'd be like  What happened  It's like  Oh well  Your father got arrested

[03:38:00]  Because I thought  I was a little better  You know  There was pure dysfunction  Down there  Sure  It was  You know what I mean  It was more your crowd  It was more my crowd  And then when you're  Down there playing  And the street lights  Come on  And your old grandmother  Comes walking down the street  In her fucking old nightie  With her stockings  Down to her ankles  Going  Richard, Robert  Time to come in  In front of a bunch  Of black kids  Your old white  Fucking grill  Then they having  A block party  And she gives me  Fucking potato pancakes  To bring to a black  Block party  Fucking

[03:40:30]  And then I turn around  And I walk back down  Oh  And it was fucking  The walk of shame  It was just horrible  The rest of the summer  And everything  You were the faggot  That wouldn't jump off the high dive  Yeah that takes balls  I would just say  Fuck it  Close my eyes and go  And I finally went off the high dive  I was doing a show  Outdoors  At a pool  Years ago  There was like a pool  Whatever  I was doing a show outdoors  The dog and horse  With those fucking teeth  And I went  I went off  High dive  In Asbury Park  Yeah  Off the steel pier 
[03:41:00]  The steel pier  In the air  So it was not  A great childhood  No it doesn't sound like it  Fucking horrible  The worst go-kart  Everybody had nice go-karts  I had a fucking plank  They were building them  Nice ones  You know  Oh would you have the fucking  Two by six  With the two two by fours  And the fucking wagon wheels  Yeah  If you just turn it  The stroller wheels  I fucking  Almost took my leg off  With a rope  Yeah with a rope  Those suck  The big bolt
