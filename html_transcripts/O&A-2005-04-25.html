<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the fallout from a major, approximately 45-50 minute on-air argument between Opie and Jim Norton.  Listeners' overwhelmingly intense reactions, which crashed the show's message boards, were a central topic.  The hosts repeatedly insisted the fight was genuine, despite widespread listener speculation that it was staged. They analyzed listener posts, finding amusement in various interpretations.  Opie's brother's enthusiastic online defense of him, despite his naiveté about online discourse, was highlighted.  The conversation also covered their professional relationship, Opie's role in creating the show, guest management (particularly comedians), and Norton's upcoming HBO special, explaining his absence from the show.  Listeners repeatedly requested a replay of the argument, with XM's refusal becoming a source of frustration.  The hosts debated the argument's merits as "good radio" and its impact on listenership, contrasting it with a poorly received interview with Tommy Chong.  Callers shared their experiences and reactions to the argument, with one caller emphasizing the show's ability to spark listener conversation, and another noting Anthony's silent, sandwich-eating presence during the fight.  The hosts recounted their shared post-argument bathroom break where they laughed about the incident, Opie describing it as feeling like "two brothers fighting".  Jay Moore's role in managing the show during the argument was mentioned.  A humorous anecdote about an XM executive, Lee Abrams, and his encounters with attractive women following a plane landing was included, followed by a discussion of poor customer service experiences, focusing on outsourced call centers in India and Jamaica, with in-studio guest Steve contributing anecdotes. The segment concluded with a humorous audio clip of Jim Norton's motivational tapes and a discussion of Norton's upcoming taping and the hosts' schedule.  Funny listener submissions, including subway indecency stories and a graphic anecdote about Opie’s grandmother’s tongue-kissing experience and a road trip were shared.

The next segment heavily featured their intern, Ricky.  Opie and Anthony relentlessly mocked Ricky's perceived incompetence, recounting numerous instances of his failures, including a comical quest for a CAT5 cable "for Mars".  They detailed his poor academic performance, his mother's disapproval, and their doubts about his future in radio due to his lack of personality and confidence.  A short interview with Ricky, where he recounted his experiences, was played. The hosts assigned Ricky a presentation on sarcasm.  In contrast,  intern Travis was praised for his efficiency, and an incident where he was unexpectedly spotted at a press conference was mentioned. The hosts also discussed their habit of discarding unsolicited band CDs, with Opie recounting a humorous anecdote about throwing Sully Erna's demo into a river.

A significant portion of the show featured an interview with former WWE wrestler Matt Hardy, discussing his release from the WWE following the discovery of compromising messages between his girlfriend Lita and Edge.  Hardy detailed his anger and disappointment with WWE's handling of the situation and the negative perception of Edge within the WWE community.  He also addressed Triple H's alleged comments about his drawing power.  The conversation touched upon his future wrestling prospects and the possibility of a future conflict with Edge, possibly in a UFC match.  The segment transitioned to listener calls about subway flashers in New York City, followed by a discussion of the skydiver, Albert Wing, whose parachute was struck by a plane's wing, highlighting the irony of his last name.  A student pilot caller offered insight into the potential circumstances of the accident.

The show then shifted to a discussion of skydiving accidents, leading to a call from Anthony's brother, Joe, seeking a drummer for his band.  A song by Joe, a James Taylor-esque parody with explicit, offensive lyrics, was played. The remainder focused on a detailed, graphic account of Joe's severe nosebleed requiring hospitalization during the hosts' family vacation. The hosts described the medical procedure, the copious amount of blood, and the extended treatment.  Opie shared a similar, albeit less severe, nosebleed story.  The segment concluded with the hosts expressing sympathy for Joe, while contrasting his hospital stay with their own vacation. Yoshi was mentioned as a poorly-received guest on a later show, which some listeners felt vindicated Opie's position in his argument with Norton.

[00:03:30]  This is a scumbag.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  Pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for power.  Here comes, here comes, here comes, here comes, here comes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us  Opie  I want my coffee  Anthony  I want that fact  Jim Norton  I want Ozzy  We are going to dumb this thing down  To the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children  No, do it  It's terrible  The Opie and Anthony Show  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Now it's bullshit, bro 
[00:04:30]  I'm very calm  You're insane  Come on, man  I'm very calm  I didn't say that  I don't blow off people that I like  Right, right now  You're right  That is bullshit  Holy shit, are you kidding me?  Stop misquoting me  I don't know, dickhead  Because I don't know what was going on that day, fuckface  You know that's what I was doing 
[00:05:00]  We were not going to do that, you ass  I'm paranoid and I have issues  Aw, don't get all angry and yell  Whatever, Jimmy  You are insane  You're right  That's terrific  That's terrific  Stop whining  Stop  Quiet  Stupid  You're so stupid  Stop with the semantics  You've got to calm down a little bit 
[00:05:30]  God damn it  Are you fucking with me?  Now we're having fun  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program  Hey, good morning  Good morning to everybody  Good morning, Mr. Breakfast  How's your tuna fish, Anthony?  Tuna-y  God, where do we begin today? 
[00:06:00]  Oh my God  What a weekend we all had, huh?  Really, you think?  I think  No  It was fun-filled  The message boards had a great weekend  Oh my God  They had a lot of fun  Yeah, this was like  Over, I hate to tell you guys  In the end  Nothing  Major traffic  Over nothing  I was really entertained  Over the weekend  Checking in  On the message boards  And looking at the  Just thread after thread 
[00:06:30]  Of speculation  And accusation  Masturbation  Just throwing things out there  Some people that had  Had pretty good insight  On the situation at hand  And what was going on  Were you posting?  I think I posted like twice  But it was just pretty much  Quick little hits  Nothing  I didn't have any long dialogue  Or any long monologue  That I posted to answer  To any of this  It was pretty much just 
[00:07:00]  Guys  What a bunch of tools  What a bunch of fucking tools  I gotta tell you guys something  You know  A lot of people look at me  Like I'm insane  Well  Yeah  Read your posts  On the message boards  Yeah  Read your posts  You're listening to the  Perfect show for you  Wow  At one point  They thought  That you should leave the show  Yeah  I don't know how I got  Craig  You know  I read a couple like that  You know  Anthony really didn't support  His showmates 
[00:07:30]  Him just sitting there  And then another one  Was like  Him just sitting there  Is proof that  It was all fake  Because he would have  Jumped in  And I'm reading these  Just going  Do you know when  And I would try to convey  This at times earlier  Maybe years ago  On message boards  But I pretty much gave up  But do you know  And I'm talking to the people  Out there  And some of the people  That we're posting  And all this  Do you know when  You absolutely know  Something to be true  Because you were part of it 
[00:08:00]  And then somebody says  That it wasn't true  Right  Do you know the  The feeling of  What an asshole you get  Looking at the person  That  Because it's you  It's you living it  You know it to be  Absolutely true  And someone saying  No it wasn't true  You just  Do you know how you feel  About that person  How stupid they look to you  Because you are  Absolutely sure  Of what happened  That is what it was like  Reading some of these posts  Dude  So fake  Such a bit  I can't believe  Any of you are falling for it 
[00:08:30]  And I'm just thinking  How stupid  These people come off  Posting stuff like that  First of all  No offense to Jimmy  Because he is an actor  You know he has done  Some acting  No offense to you  You're not an actor  But for anyone  To assume that  For almost an hour  For just about an hour  These two guys  Could put on a performance  Like that  And hold it together  And actually act  Like that  You're insane 
[00:09:00]  Oh we would have  Pulled that for April Fool's  If we could have  Pulled it off  There's no way  And based on past performance  We don't  We just don't do that  We don't do that  Fake radio  Well we're getting  Some of the message posts  Some of the posts  From the message boards there  Nathaniel just handed these in  This is Smokey McPot  That fight was pretty funny  I'm a pretty good judge of character  So I think I know  Where it all stems from  Opie is annoyed  That his show  That he started 
[00:09:30]  Is beginning  In the beginning  Is kind of being hijacked  By Norton  Wrong  Try again  On the other hand  I think that Jim might  Kind of get bothered  By Opie sometimes  I mean he's in shape  Fairly good looking  And doesn't pay for sex  So that's Opie's  Jimmy's problem  Opie's my fave guy  On the show  Sure he doesn't do impressions  Or make fun of Lacey Peterson  But he keeps things together  This is  Ack Ack I guess 
[00:10:00]  I must say  After listening  I could swear  It was real  But taking everything  Into consideration  I think at this point  I'm 50-50  In favor of it  Being a bit  Oh god  Taking into account  Opie's recently  Talking about  Smoking pot  And the fight  Being replaced  With a Tommy Chong bit  See here's  You guys are assholes  God they look  Into everything  Did you see the post  Where they looked  Into the song  That was played  After the fight  Oh the Nine Inch Nails song  The Nine Inch Nails song 
[00:10:30]  Dude they were like  Dude did you hear  What  You  Jesus  Shit's going down dude  Did you read  Did you hear the song  Oh it is in there  Cool  But also his  Now positive stance  With XM  Would be part of that gag  Like when you're high  And you're just positive  About everything  Playing the hand  That feeds  From Nine Inch Nails  Coming back from the break  Sounds like  A little cue  They're screwing with us  Because at that point  The argument was over 
[00:11:00]  And I don't think  Opie would have taken  A jab like that  At that point  Opie did you know  Nine Inch Nails  Was being played  Yeah and I was  At the time  Because after the fight  I mean did you  Did you play it  Oh no no no  Did you know  It was coming up  No no no  Of course not  Of course not  That's more people  Speculating and posting  That have no clue  How things work in here  We pick a lot of music  That we want to play  Coming out of break  And then the guys  In the booth  I don't think  They even purposely played it  It was just coming up  Randomly and that 
[00:11:30]  It just happened  To go that way  Right Derek  Oh Ben actually picked it  So maybe Ben was messing  With the audience a little bit  I must say  It was fake  They are  If it was fake  They are the greatest actors  They were so quick  Back and forth  And pretty much  Never hesitated  And it sounded exactly  Like those intense fights  You have with family  Or friends  Because it was an intense  Fight with a friend  And the more I think about  Here's another one  From Dupree  The more I think about it  The more I blame Ben Sparks  Ben just threw his arms up in the air 
[00:12:00]  Like what would I do  His gossip  Is probably what started  A lot of this in the first place  Opie brought him in  To verify that Jimmy  Had problems in the past  With some of the shows  Who knows if Ben is right or not  It's pretty obvious  That Ben and Jimmy  Don't like each other very much  Pretty obvious dude  Oh my god  There's a deep love there  It's just amazing  You know  Anthony and I  Have been doing this show 
[00:12:30]  Together for ten years  Jimmy's been doing this show  With us off and on  Well  You know  Now on  Last year we were at N.E.W.  So he's up to  You know  A few years himself now  And it's just  It's kind of sad  That the people  That listen to the show  Really have no clue  How it works  They really don't  Some of you do  You can't blame them  For not having a clue  That isn't even  I wouldn't even go there  I'm not blaming them  For not having a clue  I'm blaming them  For intense speculation  Without any basis 
[00:13:00]  Without any clue  Like if you don't have a clue  That's fine  But now if you're basing  These really strong opinions  On not having a clue  You're an idiot  Right  And we read them  And go  Oh my god  What an idiot  Totally wrong  And it's  It was kind of sad  But you know  You guys do what you want  With the message boards  But just watching  Everyone pick sides  And try to like  Do the divide and conquer  And all that  Unbelievable  Unbelievable  We're talking about  The huge fight  On Friday obviously  That I thought 
[00:13:30]  In my mind  Was a ten minute fight  No  That's how intense it was  No  I had no idea  Ten minute  I thought it was  Three and a half hours  Really  From me sitting here  From everybody else  Except for you two  Yeah  It went on and on  And just wouldn't stop  If you asked me though  I would have said  Ah it was like  A ten minute fight  Yeah  I mean notes were being  You know  Thrown in front of my face  Move on  And uh  No that went on  And that made me laugh  I'm like  When you're in that  That really bad zone  Where you're fighting  And stuff  You can't just stop 
[00:14:00]  And go  Okay that was a good  Radio bit  Let's move on  To something funny  Everybody  Yeah  But for people  To divide and conquer  They just don't get  What this show's all about  None of us are going anywhere  Everybody got  Got reamed on  On the boards  It was so funny  The best was  I expected to get reamed  Of course  Jimmy got reamed  You know  Of course  But I didn't think  They were going to  Throw you on  Oh I get reamed too  Yeah there were  There were a few of those  I'm reading them going  What did I do  I just sat there  Dude that's just it  Just fucking sat there 
[00:14:30]  What the hell  Was I supposed to do  Absolutely amazing  You know if Anthony  It's so telling  That Anthony didn't jump in  It just goes to show you  That he doesn't like  These two guys  What?  The speculation  Running wild  Over the weekend  The message board  Whackbag at least  Crashed so many times  They had like more traffic  Than they've ever had  It was insane  All the message boards  Were  Yeah 
[00:15:00]  Were crashing  I took a peek here and there  Posted a couple things  Really fast  And that was it  I had a couple posts  Said like 1%  Said 1% of the people  Posting in the thread  Had good insight  On what was going on  49.5% were  Complete tools  And the other 49.5%  I put some derogatory  Thing about their mother  That's pretty much it  That's what it gets  Yeah that's what  It degenerates to  Yeah you know  I just wish  Some of the smarter people 
[00:15:30]  That have a little intelligence  Could kind of you know  Take controls  Of those message boards  A little bit  Never happened  It's not the nature  Of the beast man  The message boards  Are what they are  And when you realize that  Then you're fine with it  There are some people  Opie not as familiar  As working with message boards  As the seasoned veterans  That are on this show  Well the one thing  I want to say  You know  For the people that want me  To leave the program  Let me explain  Something to you  Okay  And I'm going to say this  Anthony and I 
[00:16:00]  Are complete  Equal partners here  Complete  And Jimmy is  Pretty much  An equal partner  At this point as well  Okay  That's a fact  But the reality is  This whole show  Was my vision  Like almost 20 years ago  Do you people understand  Where this show  Started from  Yeah  And you think  I'm just going to like  Walk away from it  Never  Yeah  Leave  Never  Go ahead leave  When I walk away  And we go our own ways  You know  I will definitely leave radio  And I bet  Anthony goes off 
[00:16:30]  And does something  Completely different  And he'll be just as successful  But as far as this show goes  I'm not going anywhere  This was my vision  20 years ago  Where is he going  It started with just me  And a bunch of stupid records  Getting goofy in between songs  And then developing from there  But the vision  Started back in like  1985  Something like that  Yeah  And then Anthony jumped on  In 94  You know  So we've been at this  A while  Yeah  And Jimmy's not going anywhere  Because Aunt and I  You know  We're very calculated 
[00:17:00]  We've talked many times  And go  Yeah it would be cool  To have a third person in here  So Jimmy's not going anywhere  No one's leaving  No one's leaving  And Anthony's not going anywhere  I mean he might do the show  From like a bubble suit  Or something  That is my goal  But he's not leaving  That is the goal I have  Like you had your vision  I have mine  Right  Doing this program  From an antiseptic bubble  But for the people  That just don't understand  The players  And what they do  For the show  You really got to start  Listening a little  A little longer  No they'd rather 
[00:17:30]  Concentrate a little longer  Instead of just speculating  You get one little tidbit  Of information  And then you lose your minds  And say really dumb  Stupid shit  Yeah  Is what it comes down to  It's really really fun  To look at the speculation  Based on nothing  Based on stuff  That they are sure  That we did on purpose  That when I read it  I go  It was such a passing thing  I never gave it a second thought  And I barely even know  What they're talking about  But they have it  In their minds  As such a calculated thing  That we absolutely planned 
[00:18:00]  Unbelievable  Now you spoke with Jimmy  Of course I did  Yeah  By the way  Eric just handed me a note  37 pages  37 pages  About the fight  That happened on Friday  Well here's the deal  You know  Jimmy and I went at it big time  We both have a lot of  Stupid tension in our lives  You know  Jimmy's got the HBO thing  That he's preparing for  That's the only reason  He's not here by the way  Yeah  And I don't want to say too much  Until he gets here on Wednesday  You know  But I want everyone 
[00:18:30]  To get back on the same  Fucking page  Because it's a very exciting  Night tomorrow night  We're all going down  To see Jim Norton  Tape his HBO special  Very exciting indeed  So you know  As far as the fight  And as far as  You know  Picking sides  You know  I like Jimmy better  I like Opie better  I like Anthony the best  Anthony is the true glue  Of the show  Jesus Christ  Come and fuck that up  The reality is  You know  I don't regret that  It happened  You know  But we're 
[00:19:00]  You know  We are on the same team  Is what it comes down to  Okay  I knew after we fought  That it was going to be fine  I just knew  But I couldn't talk  The rest of the show  I just had  Just a raging headache  And I even apologized  To Anthony after the show  I'm like dude  I wasn't trying to be a dick  After the fight  I couldn't even talk anymore  Because of  You know  The tension in my head  Alright  So then we cooled off  And then on Saturday  Jimmy called me  I would have called him  But he beat me to the punch  I wasn't sitting there  Like some diva  Waiting for him to call me 
[00:19:30]  Trust me  I wasn't at all  That's after the  Phone calls I took  Oh really  Yeah  I talked to you  I talked to Jimmy  Oh really  Before you two  Talked to each other  Were you like the mediator  Unofficially  No it wasn't a mediator  You guys obviously  Didn't need a mediator  But  I was kind of the  You know  Is it cool to make  The call guy  Like I talked to  And then I talked to Jimmy  And it was like  Yeah  Well you think  It's a good call  Yes of course  Call  Were you starting  An alliance with Jimmy 
[00:20:00]  Behind my back  That's exactly  What was happening  People start  Your speculation  Right  It's like to Jimmy  You know dude  I've been noticing  The signs for  For a couple years now  I really think  If we do this right  We could get him  Kicked off the show  And it'll be you and I  It's so obvious  What needs to be done here  I did show up to work today  Without shoes  Yeah  Yeah you did  And I  You know  After Friday's show  And like  All the uncomfortable looks  I did get  When I got in today 
[00:20:30]  And now I'm showing up  Without shoes  And my hair  Askew  Yeah  Because you know  I rollerblade to work  Every morning  And usually right out  Of the shower  So you know  It's windblown  And it looks like awful  But I don't really care  You know  And I walk in  And usually I throw my shoes  In my backpack  Yeah  I forgot  Because I was rushing  Out of the house this morning  So I'm showing up  Into the office  With just no shoes on  And when you do  Something crazy like that  You have to address it immediately  Oh yeah  It was the first words  Out of Opie's mouth  Oh yeah  Because I saw  Like the looks starting 
[00:21:00]  Just starting  And I'm like  Alright  I gotta squash this one  Right away  Before one of these guys  Secretly posts on the message board  He's now showing up to work  Without shoes  I had assumed  You took your blades off  And you were in between  You know  Putting  Taking the blades off  And putting your shoes on  I go to Anthony  Dude don't think I'm crazy  I just forgot my shoes today  It's gonna be a little awkward  Walking around the office  Trying to do a radio show  And I said  You think  I think you're crazy  Because you don't have shoes on  After Friday  That was the whole thing too  It was like  Yeah  I'm crazy 
[00:21:30]  Because I washed my hands  After Tippi Tom  Is in the studio  But after Friday's display  Yeah  I'm the crazy one  Yeah  Anyway  Yeah of course  Jimmy and I  Talked on Saturday  Jimmy and I  The reality is  And this is what's gonna make  A lot of people laugh  We're really really good friends  Yeah  Extremely good friends  Okay  You guys hang out more than  I think anybody else  On the show  Yeah  We're really really really good friends  And it was just one of those things  It's like brothers fighting  It's like friends fighting  Let me tell you something  Anthony and I have had some of these fights 
[00:22:00]  Behind the scenes  Yeah  You know  It's what happens when you work every day with people  You know  We've gone through  No knockdown drag outs like that  Certainly didn't last that long  No no no  They were quick  Quick  Even  You know something  Give a little tidbit to the old listeners  There were a couple  That were really heated  Right before the mics went on  N.E.W.  None here  Seconds  But the professionalism showed through back then  And you didn't have the insane Jimmy factor 
[00:22:30]  Right  It was weird  But there were  There were a couple of times  Where seconds before the mics went on  At N.E.W.  We had a tiff  Tiff?  Yeah  Brutal  Pretty good brawl  I mean where people would leave the office  Remember those?  And go oh boy  And then we'd walk down the hall  Like hating the other person  This is going way back  Say nothing  Say absolutely nothing to each other  Turn the mics on  And make believe we were the best of friends  And boom here goes the show  And then the mics would turn off  And then we wouldn't even look at each other  Or talk to each other  Yeah 
[00:23:00]  It was the most uncomfortable four hours  God that did suck  Ever  Oh Jesus  We did a few of those actually  Yeah  Not many at all though  No  Really wasn't  It was a handful  Probably  In the whole time we were there  If it was five  It was  Yeah yeah  I don't even think it was that many  Probably three  Yeah well you know  I mean we've been doing this for ten years  So a few tips  Yeah you're going to get  But anyway  So yeah  Jimmy called me  And I  He goes hey Ope  I go uh oh  Awkward moment  And he just starts laughing  And I just start laughing 
[00:23:30]  And I swear to you  Within less than two minutes  It was totally cool  Totally cool  Done over  Completely cool  Back to goofing  And then we talk for like  I don't know  Forty minutes  Just making each other laugh  Really really hard  About BS crap  And blah blah blah  And Jimmy will give his take  On Wednesday when he's here  Yeah Jimmy  Jimmy called me up  And um  At first  Like all  All Friday afternoon  I didn't take any calls  I just  Let the machine pick up  Because I really didn't want to deal with anything  I was exhausted  Just wanted to 
[00:24:00]  Lay down and do nothing  So uh  Saturday  I get the phone rings again  And it's Jimmy  So I answer it  And he  You know  Because I didn't answer his message  He had called Elo  And Elo didn't answer either  So he was like  I'm thinking  Something  Was something going on  Like  Like we're all conspiring  Like  Alright  It was obvious  Jimmy has to go  We gotta get rid of him  He's gonna be fired  He just doesn't know  So I'm not taking his calls  Or anything  Yeah  Jimmy  No  Nothing's going on  Don't even 
[00:24:30]  You know  You got this HBO thing  Keep that in your mind  Don't worry about this shit at all  Poor Jimmy  It's over and done with  Of course it is  But like  And then I was thinking  Oh my god  Imagine if I didn't answer that call  He'd have been insane  He'd have jumped  He'd have jumped out of his window  See if we really were twisted  We would have  Not answered his calls all weekend  Oh  No  I couldn't do that to the little guy  No of course not  Oh  Poor little guy  So no  We all have to get on the same page immediately  No matter whose side you were on in the fight  A lot of people picking sides 
[00:25:00]  Oh my god  Because the HBO thing is happening  And we really really want to support  And need to support Jimmy  Oh yeah  Because it's all gonna be ONA fans there  Tomorrow night  We're all going  It's gonna be great  Yep  My brother got in on the action man  Woo  This was a part of the battle  On the message boards over the weekend  That just had me roaring  You know  I love your brother  And the  That he is so naive  As far as these things go  The message board  So new at it 
[00:25:30]  It was adorable to watch  But you know what  He doesn't care  That's the beauty of it  I know  That's the beauty of it  See that's my barometer by the way  I mean  Yeah  I know I got problems  I know I got a switch in my head  That pops  You know  Goes off  That's why  In the past  We used to joke about  The psycho factor in my head  Blah blah blah  Comes out from time to time  But  What happens with me  Is nothing compared to  What happens with my brother  I talked to one of my brothers  About the fight  You know  Because he didn't hear  And he listens every day  My brother Brett  And he goes  Did you give him that huge anger  I'm like  Oh yeah I did 
[00:26:00]  We're known for this stupid huge anger  Where we just go down  To just being asses  It was brutal  And just stringing curse words together  Do you got one of those?  I think so yeah  He would have just got to come back to life  Alright  Yeah  What was that?  I don't know  Oh good  It's rebooting  Oh it's rebooting now?  Yeah  Computer locked  Alright well Anthony  That's good  That's good  I should take that  And smash it  That's what I should do 
[00:26:30]  Oh that's outrageous Anthony  I'm crazy  I'm wild  Isn't that good?  Why should you have to lock  Can't a computer sit next to me  For three minutes  And not go into some mode  Where you have to enter  I have to come down  From the ceiling  On wires  Like Mission Impossible  And not hit the lasers  That are going  And turn it back  Why can't it just sit there?  I don't know  Oh Opie  This isn't negativity  I don't want you to think  I'm being negative  What's going on with that Mars? 
[00:27:00]  Why  Why did it all of a sudden  Shut off?  Alright he's figuring it out  You're playing with the  The Jimmy  Oh boy  That's not a good sound  That's never a good sound  The Jimmy Opie soundboard  That somebody put together  I give props to the guy  He took all the fun  A lot of the fun clips  From the argument  And put them on a soundboard  Right  And over the weekend  Me and my girlfriend  Were laying in bed  With the laptops  Just having an argument  With each other  With the soundboards 
[00:27:30]  I love it  Whatever  Whatever  That was what  That was the condescending  Part of the argument  Where Opie would go  Whatever  Who cares?  Who cares?  Who cares?  Whatever  And then Jimmy  Whatever  Whatever  Whatever  Whatever  Whatever  Who cares?  Whatever  I didn't say that  I said goodbye  To Sean Rouse  I don't blow off  People that I like 
[00:28:00]  That is so  Sociopathic  I almost don't know  How to respond to it  Could be my favorite line  Of the whole argument  By the way  When Jimmy paused there  Before sociopathic  No offense to Jimmy  But I looked at him  When he said that  I wanted to just  Just strangle him  I'm like  You're calling me that?  Are you insane?  You wanted to strangle each other  I know  Whatever  This disgust whatever  The disgust whatever  Listen  Whatever  Whatever  Whatever  You're making this up 
[00:28:30]  As you go along  I think I was in here  Opie  Stop misquoting me  You are insane  You are insane  It's great  Great sound board  Anyway  Yeah so your brother  Got on board  Oh yeah  You want to go there first?  And you know  Your brother will always  Come to the other  Brother's defense  But as far as  Message boards go  It's impossible  To make any headway  But he doesn't care  That's why  I know  I know  I understand  He wasn't trying  To make any headway  But it's so funny  That like  There comes a point 
[00:29:00]  Where you just  Don't even do this anymore  You just throw your hands up  And go  I gotta accept this  As a barrel  Of tools  Right  You know  There's a couple of people  That have insight  The rest  Just idiots  And he addresses it  And it's very funny  Yes my brother Elmo  So someone posted  I'm just trying  Well it's a quote for me  I'm just trying to get  The negativity out of my life  What a bullshit line from Opie  I have to explain that  A little further  We made a conscious  Conscious effort  Just before vacation 
[00:29:30]  To stop with the negative  Bullshit toward XM  And we knew  We had to turn the page  Get on the same page  With the company  And move on  You know  Because the company  Came to us aggressively  And said look  We understand  All the problems  You guys are having  We're going to make it  Better for you guys  We're going to redo  The whole studio  Which they did by the way  Okay  So I mean  So I'm biting my lip  And trying not to be  You know  Mr. Negative asshole  Right  As I'm trying at least  Okay  Just because I think  It's time to move on  I think the listeners  Are sick of hearing us bitch 
[00:30:00]  I really do  You know  We had reasons to bitch  But now it's time  To move on  Simple as that  That's what I was  Trying to say with that  Okay  So the guy goes  What a bullshit line  From Opie  So my brother goes  You're a fan of the show  You do not know Opie personally  You don't know  A damn thing about him  This is a very important point  That many people  On this board miss  My bro can defend himself  So he doesn't need me  But I will say  His statement about  Eliminating negativity  From his life  Is absolutely true  And it reflects his attitude  Of positive thinking 
[00:30:30]  He specifically  And my family in general  Have had a seemingly  Unending negative streak  The last couple of years  A lot of things  That the fans know nothing about  He channels all his energy  Into doing a great show  To sit there  And call him a bullshitter  Is beyond the scope of reality  It is a completely  Disingenuous statement  From someone  I can only assume  Is an utter moron  Why don't you ask yourself  What do I personally know  About Opie  If the answer is  Not a thing  Then do us a favor  And shut up  So then this guy writes  Whether any of us  Know him or not 
[00:31:00]  He fucking disintegrated  Yesterday in front of  The whole fucking country  Maybe he was just  Being an ass  Something he seems  To try real hard to do  But still there's no  Excuse for him  To treat Jimmy like he did  Regardless of what  Kind of radio show it is  Jimmy's right  An acknowledgement of thanks  Should always be given  On air to guests  And Opie just said  Tough shit  What an ass  The whole thanking  Sean Rouse  Got blown way out of proportion  I was the one  That wanted him  On the show  I think he's  A beyond funny guy  You know something  The basis of the argument 
[00:31:30]  Was nothing  Compared to the argument  Itself  Like I didn't even  Really give the basis  Of the argument  That much thought  Right  And then when I did  I kind of  I  Kind of saw  Jimmy's side of it  And all  But being familiar  With the show  Because I've been  Sitting here for ten years  I understand what it's like  The guest comes in  Especially a comic  That isn't like  You know  Eddie Murphy coming in  You know 
[00:32:00]  Sitting down and waiting  They're going to have to wait  Until they come in  Depending on what's going on  Some of them get brought right in  Some of them don't  If we're talking about something  Or we have a subject  That we're going to  Get going on  Even if we don't  Put it this way too  Even if we don't have  Material that we're  Just ready to go to  We kind of want to  Get something started  Before we bring people in  So that they can then  Become part of the show  And not sit there  And do their act  Right  They have to be able  To come into something  That's already stirring  A little bit  And join the environment 
[00:32:30]  Right  So when a comic  Sits out there for a while  We're just getting things  Going in here  So we can be brought  Into an atmosphere  That's more conducive  To jumping in  What's his name there  Sean Rouse  Sean  Was sitting out there  For a while  While we were getting  Stuff going  We had Chris Jericho  Coming in  And a lot of people  Were like  You know  It's bullshit  Because Opie  Played a Fozzy song  At the end of the show  And that would have been  Plenty of time  To talk  Chris pretty much said 
[00:33:00]  He wanted that Fozzy song  Played  You know  That was what he said  As almost  I don't want to say  Condition of him coming on  But it was one of those things  Guys I want to come on the show  But I really like it  If you guys played  One of my tunes  Well he's a friend of the show  And if a friend of the show  Asks us to do something  We'll give him a promise  Like yeah  Alright we'll play your song  At the end of the show  No problem man  Now other times  Also with Sean  Comics come in  Sometimes they can sit down  And immediately  They're great  They work on the show  And it's fine 
[00:33:30]  They fit in  They're talking about  Whatever we're talking about  They're being funny  Other times they come in  Don't say five words  Pretty much get acclimated  To what we do  And then their next appearance  Is brilliant  You know  That's just the way  This show works  And he came in  It wasn't a stellar appearance  It didn't suck  I've got to be honest  It didn't suck  But nothing was really  Developing there  It's not something  That people are going to  Call back and go  Wow I've got to hear that again  Or write about  In months to come 
[00:34:00]  And go wasn't that  A great appearance  Or anything  It just happens  It's not that the guy  Isn't funny  He sucks  He can't  It's just some people  Come in here  And depending on  What's going on sometimes  Or depending on their head  Or ours or whatever  You know  Colin's been great on our show  Colin Quinn  Comes on  Has been hysterically funny  When we've had  Laverne and Shirley in  And everything like that  His last appearance  On this show  Stunk on ice  Doesn't mean Colin sucks  A lot of that was our fault  That day  It just happens  That's how it is  Doesn't mean Colin sucks  Doesn't mean Sean sucks 
[00:34:30]  But that's just the way it worked  And because that was  What was going on  It wasn't like  We were going to say  Alright let's dedicate  The last ten minutes  Of the show  To Sean  Because  It just wasn't  It wasn't  We weren't feeling it  Is what you know  Is how you put it  See it's  It's really simple  With this program too  Anthony and I  You know  We  And Jimmy  We come up with stuff  Wow what was that  Computer shut off again  Oh okay  Basically we'll do  What's called bits 
[00:35:00]  Or whatever you want to call them  Okay  And we'll get into a flow  We cannot stop that flow  Just to get someone in here  To make them happy  We just can't do it  We won't do it  As we move forward here  We just won't  I mean if all of a sudden  Ozzy's walking through the door  Then you might  Well yeah  Then you might see us stop  Definitely  But in general  It is so hard  To do this radio show  On a daily basis  That when Anthony and I  And Jimmy are in a flow  What we do as performers  Is we ride that out  As long as we possibly can  For your enjoyment 
[00:35:30]  And then when that ends  What happens when we hit  The commercial break  We sit here  And regroup  And go okay  What's next  Okay we got Sean  We got this  Chris Jericho's coming in  Then we figure out  Where we're going to go next  And then when that person  Comes in or that next bit  Starts  Guess what  We try to ride that out  As long as we can  And if we go to the phones  And the phones are hot  You know what  We'll ride them out  As long as we can  And then regroup  That's what frustrates  The hell out of me  That these people  Just don't understand  How a radio show works  How it works  They just hear it  On the outside  They don't get it 
[00:36:00]  They just don't get it  They just assume  We're so brilliant  That all of a sudden  You know  We'll stop what we're doing  Because you know  There's a comic  Sitting outside  Waiting to come in  It just doesn't work  That way  Well but I wasn't  Really getting the  They think we're so  Brilliant thing though  On the message  No I understand that  But I mean as far as  Like you know  Just stopping what we're doing  And just you know  Just starting with  Somebody else like that  And it's going to be  Radio gold  It just doesn't work  That way  That we should be able  To just the second  They walk in  Put them on the air here  And continue what we were doing 
[00:36:30]  Sometimes it's distracting  We're in a flow  We're talking about a subject  That me, Opie and Jimmy  Are really familiar with  We're rolling on it  We're throwing stuff  Back and forth  To bring another person in  That really isn't familiar  With that  Puts a damper on it  You know  Puts the brakes on it  Right  So we try not to do that  And if that means  People have to wait  You have to wait  You know I hate to tell you  But at this point  In our careers too  It's really a privilege  For these people  To be on our show  Most of them are friends  I'm not talking about 
[00:37:00]  The friends of the show  You know  I mean we're just all friends  And we enjoy each other's company  And make each other laugh  But there's a bunch of other people  It truly is just a privilege  To get on the air  And if that means  You get here at 7 in the morning  And you don't get on  Until you know  Quarter to 11  Tough shit  You know  It's still great exposure  For whoever that person might be  Right  It's simple as that  It's not like the old days  Where we're doing a little show  You know  For Worcester, Massachusetts  Where we're thankful  When these people  Are coming on our show  At this point  We're really doing  A lot of people  You know  Favors  We just are 
[00:37:30]  It's just the nature of the beast  You know  I mean think about Letterman  Letterman bumps people all the time  Know why?  Yeah they show up  And they don't get on at all  Because Letterman  Does his monologue or something  And it's flowing  So he goes  You know  Two or three minutes longer  Doing a monologue or something  And don't start comparing us  To Letterman  I'm just trying to make an example  You asses  Because I  Dude  Because someone's already typing  Yeah  Oh I can't believe  They would actually compare themselves  To David Letterman  Dude  No as far as  You know  This type of programming works 
[00:38:00]  If you go along somewhere else  Something else is going to suffer  That's all I'm saying  So when  You know  Letterman does a long monologue  Because he feels like  He's flowing  And he's in the zone  Guess what  Sometimes that means  He's got to bump a comic  Or something  Right  So you can't stop  The flow of the show  Just to get someone in here  That might be waiting  A little too long outside  You just can't  Right  So moving on with  This guy's post  Backing my brother  What an ass  Give me  Okay  It reminds me of the intro  That used to play  Where it had that quote from Opie  Where he said  We are just dicks 
[00:38:30]  Almost like he's proud  Of being a dick  And he needs to shout it out  From a rooftop  Hey look at me  I'm a dick  He needs to quit trying  So hard to be a prick  And do the radio show  It's like  Lately he's forcing it  And it comes across as fake  Again I don't know him personally  And don't care to  But he fucking lost his mind yesterday  Oh and before you tell people  To shut up about Opie  And how hard his fucking life has been  How about taking a look  At how he treats people  On the radio show  Fuck Opie  He can take a few shots  So my brother writes back  Listen prick  Did he even read my fucking post 
[00:39:00]  What an ass  You're talking about Jimmy  And how hard my bro's  Fucking life has been  What a complete tool  None of your stupid comments  Had any bearing on what I posted  So why the F did you quote me  If you don't know Opie personally  Then don't say shit  Like I'm just trying to get  The negativity out of my life  What a bullshit line from Opie  It's a pathetic statement  By an obvious asshole  Very simple  Obviously you're such a freaking moron  That you just want people  To pay attention to you  Well I'm paying attention to you  You're a dick  You know it  I know it  And the world laughs at you  When you walk down the street 
[00:39:30]  Pat from Unaki says  Does Elmo realize  He's probably arguing  With a 12 year old  Yeah  Good one Pat  Good one Pat  Well  What are you gonna  All right  And then  I mean my brother  Was all over the message board  Oh crazy  Here's another post from him  Yeah let's see who  The little douchebag is  You fucking tool  If you have such a bad opinion  Of my bro  Then turn your XM in  And go elsewhere  Asshole  Little whining jerks  Like you make me laugh  Your life is so utterly 
[00:40:00]  Pathetic that you try  To be big men  On a fucking message board  What a dick  You're laughable  At least other people  Are discussing the incident  As normal human beings  Go away  No one will miss you  That is for sure  Oh  Well  So anyway  Let's go to the phones  Real fast  Yeah  Then we're gonna move on  To other things today  Chad in Virginia  What's up  Hey what's up  I gotta tell you  Real or not  That was the best radio  You guys have done yet  But I wanna know  Why XM cut it out  Of the replay  I got up at 3am 
[00:40:30]  This morning to listen to it  And I had to listen  To Tommy fucking Chong  I know  Well I gotta explain that  Big controversy there  Punch it out  Here's the deal  After  After the show Friday  I just had  An awful headache  And I just left the building  Cause I wrote that  In one of my posts  Like oh  You couldn't even stick around  To like try to work things out  No  My head was hurting so bad  I just had to get out of the  Everyone got out of here  Yeah  We all just went our own ways  Okay  I had no idea  That they were gonna  Edit the fight out  I swear to you 
[00:41:00]  No one called me  No one called Anthony  Jimmy had nothing to do  Do with it  The show  The guys on the air  Had nothing to do with it  Supposedly Ben and Eric Logan  Decided to  Cut the fight out of the  The replay  I guess it ran once  And then after that  They decided  It just wouldn't be smart  To replay it  Which is so  Sad and stupid  To be honest with you  Yeah I know  Because as far as radio goes  You know  The reality is  I look like an ass on Friday  I'm not dumb  I know that  And at times  Jimmy looked like an ass  He knows that 
[00:41:30]  But you know what  But we also understand  That that makes great radio  We both understand  That big time  Right  And for them to like  Not replay that  Not only all day Friday  And then over the weekend  Is just dumb programming  As far as XM goes  Whose call was that?  And I gotta tell you  You know  Eric Logan  Who we love  And he supports the show  He dropped the ball on this one  Yeah why would you pull that?  Why as a listener  Would you not  Because this is their logic  Not want to hear  In my opinion 
[00:42:00]  Very real, honest  Awful  With all the scars  Type of radio  For 45, 50 minutes  Who wouldn't want to listen to that?  As long and stupid as it was  And instead want to listen to  An old Tommy Chong interview  It just doesn't make any sense to me  At all  Not at all  What was his logic in that one?  I don't know  Maybe we could get him on the air  I'd love to know  What the thinking is  Where the negative  Because he must have had  Some kind of  You know  Thought it was a bad idea  Had some  What is it? 
[00:42:30]  What's the  What's the downside of playing that?  As far as  Elo's concerned  I don't know  I'd love to know  The message boards went nuts on that  So I quickly posted  Like look  You guys gotta understand  I  Jimmy  And I forgot to throw your name in there  Because then they speculate  Whoa  Anthony doesn't even have a say anymore  Oh  Jesus  But I was thinking  Because it was Jimmy and I's  You know  Fight aware  I didn't even have  Oh you wrote it that way  So it looked like  I didn't have a say  Yeah yeah  Or that you might have been the one that  That made the call  That pulled it  Because I didn't mention your name 
[00:43:00]  I called Elo  And said  Do you know something?  And this is the God's honest truth  I don't even have Elo's phone number in my phone  I had to call Ben to get Elo's phone number  And it's written down somewhere  But I don't even  I don't make those calls  Because I don't want to talk to management  I like Elo as a person  I like Elo hanging out  When we go out to dinner  And he's the anti-Bob Eatman  At dinners  He's fun  His conversations are entertaining 
[00:43:30]  And I like Elo as a person  But as far as work related stuff  I cannot be bothered talking to any of them  I don't want to talk to them  I don't like to  And when people speculate as to  Who is who's superior here  In our little show world  Yeah, me and Ope are equal  There's not going to be any decisions made  Without consulting the other one  And on all aspects of the show 
[00:44:00]  We're equal  But Opie for some reason  I don't even want to use the word enjoys  But you do say you enjoy  I used to  Dealing with these people more than I do  I used to  I mean how this happened was  I mean I was the quote  Experienced radio guy  And then you know  Anthony came aboard  And he was very green  But had unbelievable raw talent  And now I'm talking 10 years ago  Now it's like  I was a diamond in the rock  You know now it's like  We're completely equal 
[00:44:30]  But Anthony didn't really know  How a radio station worked  Or how radio in general worked  So  Happy to be there  So I took on the role as  You know  The go-to guy  And for some reason  10 years later  I'm still looked at as the go-to guy  And I'm trying to get away from that role  More and more  I really am  You know  I don't  I don't enjoy it anymore  At all  You know  I don't know if it made the air  But because we were fighting  During the breaks and stuff too  Friday  And Jimmy's like  Calling me the boss and stuff  And that drives me nuts  I'm not  I don't want to be considered the boss 
[00:45:00]  I really don't  You know  That's why I told Jimmy  And other people  Like if you have a problem  Then you go to the bosses  Or if you had a problem  With how Sean Rouse  Was handled on the show  Then jump in  You know  It's not my call  Well then  Everything should be delegated  Through Ben  That's it  You know  That's what I do  I don't  Because I don't enjoy  Dealing with upper management  Of any corporation  And that's just been me  Throughout my whole life  I don't like bosses  I never have  So if I have an issue  With anything  I go to Ben 
[00:45:30]  And I go  Ben  This, that, this, that  And I let it filter through Ben  I don't mind  Dealing with Eric Logan at all  I don't  And if there's things to discuss  Obviously I call you right away  And we don't make any decisions  Unless you and I agree  That's how it's always been  But as far as like  Being looked at  As the boss  The main guy in the show  I really have hated that  For years  And have really tried my best  To get away from that  You know  I don't know why  It still looked at  That way  But whatever  It's because you're 
[00:46:00]  The guy that does  You know  But I mean  Just a horrible call  By Washington  To edit the fight out  I mean  The negativity was  Just, you know  Two really good friends  Just ripping their heads off  Yeah  And Jimmy even admitted to me  On Saturday  He's like  Dude, I've had these  Knockout, drag out fights  With all my friends  That are close to me  Yeah  He says he's had  Legendary ones  With Keith Robinson  And he mentioned  A few other people  I don't want to quote him  Because I forget exactly  But I think  Did he break the N-word out  During those  You can only imagine  So  Let's go to Dan in Jersey 
[00:46:30]  Dan, what's up?  Hey guys  I just wanted to know  How many times  Jimmy blinked  That almost  Lychotic blink  During the argument  Yeah  Blinky  Yeah, he was blinking  Pretty good  Well  I mean  We'll get Jimmy's  You know  His whole take  On this thing  On Wednesday  The only reason  He's not here  Today or tomorrow  Is because he's  Getting ready  For the big HBO thing  Tomorrow night  Yeah, he's getting  Like his sleep done  And you know  He's working out  At the clubs  I guess  Well this is huge  For Jimmy  And it's huge  For the show  As well  These HBO specials 
[00:47:00]  I mean  Once you do them  They're out there  You know  They last forever  How many of these  Do you tune in  Like HBO plays  You see ones  From the 80's  And stuff  These things  Just are there forever  So you want to be able to  You want to make sure  You do them right  Right  So I mean  You know  I ask that we all  Get on the same page  Because obviously  A lot of you guys  Are going to the taping  Tomorrow night  And you got to show  Nothing but support  To Jimmy  Respect  Let's go to Ed  In California  Ed what's up  Hey guys  Hey  I just wanted to let you know  That me and  A bunch of people out here  We were talking about 
[00:47:30]  The last week  Because we've only been  Listening since  You guys came on  In October  We actually paid  The six cents a day  Right  And I have to say  Hands down  It was pretty much  The best week  You guys had  On XM  I have no idea  About your NEW days  Never listened to you then  But it was by far  The best week  And  Well we got a lot of  We got a lot of audio  From our NEW days  On OAVirus.com  So you can do a little  Catching up  In your free time  Yeah  There's some great stuff  On there  Overall I mean 
[00:48:00]  And you know  You're right  It was a little rough  In October  Going through November  You know  But you guys caught up  But man  It was fantastic  Last week  I mean overall  Just you know  Who you brought in  What happened  You know  Stuff that was said  You know  Yada yada yada  It was just  I was crying  Over the weekend  It was so funny man  I listened to both  Saturday and Sunday  Oh that's cool  No it sucks  On Friday  We were having another  It was setting up  To be another  Really good show too  And then  Jimmy said something  During the break  And I don't know 
[00:48:30]  A switch went off  In my head  And the weird thing  A switch went off  In his head  At the same time  You two were both  That's rare  It was one of those  The perfect storm happened  You know  It was one of those things  Where  And another factor  Because I wasn't  Planning on going there  And he wasn't  Because there are times  Because Jimmy and I  Are very close  And our personalities  Are such that we  You know  We're both  Like psychopaths  Really  You're both insane  And there are times  Like Jimmy will have  A problem with me  And give me a quick blast  And I'll back down  Like whoa  Okay yeah  You make a good point  Or whatever  And I'll do the same 
[00:49:00]  To him  And he'll back down  But for some reason  It just was like  Two ramps  Ready to go  And then you brought up  Another point  Over the weekend  The fact that  And I never do this  I left the studio  So I wasn't even here  At the beginning of this  To maybe say  Oh you would have squashed it  Yeah  Because guys  We're going back on the air  Deal with this after the show  What happened was  We go to commercial  And Jimmy was excited  About Yoshi  And those people  You know  The porn people  Being here 
[00:49:30]  And I made just  A side comment  Like oh god  More porn crap  Because we're really  Trying to figure out  What we could do  With the naked chicks  And the porn  On this show  And that made him say  Oh man  You can't  You know  You can't make them wait  Like you did  Sean Rouse  And I went  What?  And at that point  You left the studio  I left the studio  Before that actually  Now I went out  Because my root canal dentist  Had been talking about  How he wanted to come in  And watch the show  Oh that's right  Your dentist was out there  So I walked out  To talk to him  And I never leave the studio 
[00:50:00]  So I walked out  And missed the whole  Beginning of this argument  And by the way  It's great  The dentist  The first time he comes in  To see the show live  He was shell shocked  He left  I didn't even get  To say goodbye to him  He was looking  Through this window dude  Shell shocked  Like oh my god  Is this what goes on  On this fucking show?  So now he's got this  Image of the show  That it's just  Us killing each other  And getting on the air  Hi how you doing  So when I walked back in  You guys are already 
[00:50:30]  Fully involved  Way involved  Way out of control  I couldn't put it out  I'll be honest  I think the best stuff  Was said off air  Unfortunately  Because it was  The beginning of the whole thing  You know  And then we just jumped in  When we got back live  Two seconds of trying  To fake it  When those mics came on  Well you can't fake it  No  No  I mean we turned the corner  A while ago  You can't fake shit  On the radio  No but it didn't even  Like you guys didn't even  Try to keep it off the air  No  It was like  Hi we're back  You know Jimmy  Right 
[00:51:00]  I do blame you  Because I think  If you were in the studio  You would have squashed it  Yeah it's my fault  You would have squashed it  Like I said  Hey before it got to that  Yeah  Point of no return  Guys guys guys  Every fight has that  Point of no return  Point of no return  You know you're starting  And you could stop  But then you hit that switch  And it's over  And I think you would have  Been able to stop us  No  So let's talk about this  After the show  Everything's fine  I walked back in the studio  Not more than a minute later  And I was like  Oh my god  What did I miss  How the hell did this flare up  Yeah  Yeah  At least I got to eat my sandwich 
[00:51:30]  And the dentist  The dentist  Right away  Dude I was looking out the window  At him  While you two were going at it  Yeah  And his  He was just like  Oh my god  I saw the look on his face  Was oh my god  Is this what goes on  On this show  Yeah  It was  It was so uncomfortable  To sit here also  In my little seat  I'm just trolling  Instant feedback  I know  You know  Anthony  What are you doing right now  They're talking  Yeah they're talking to me  They're talking to you  Through the screen  Oh nothing  I am just sitting here 
[00:52:00]  Hoping this is a bad dream  You know what sucks  When you have one of those  In front of a lot of people  I'm not even counting  Like the audience  But I mean  I couldn't even look at anyone  After  After that break  I couldn't look at Jimmy anymore  I could barely look at you  I'm like  These guys just think  I'm a fucking lunatic  It was just  And I looked and went  Oh my god  We have you know  Two and a half hours  Of the show left  Right  And just knew  It was going to be  A long two and a half  Alright let's go to Keith  And PA  Keith what's up  Hey old man  What's up  Hey man 
[00:52:30]  Hey guys  That  I think that happened  To a lot of us man  I had just got out of my car  And went over to switch it  To my PC at my desk  And I'm sitting there going  What the hell just happened  I know  What did I miss  What's going on  We were all in a really good mood  Friday  And like I said  The first hour  It was a pretty good hour  And we were ready to  Really have another one  Of those stellar shows  And then man  Yep  Oh guys  I'll tell you what though  It was compelling radio  The only thing  And the favor I have to ask  And I don't know  Whether you can accomplish this  Or not  But man I'm telling you 
[00:53:00]  I joined Wackbag  And I've been a fan  Since AAF days  A buddy of mine  Used to cassette tape  Or tape you on cassettes  Ship them down to me  So I could listen to it  Nice  That's how big of a fan  I was at that point  Very cool  It was very cool  And I've been a fan  That long  And I never joined Wackbag  You know  Because obviously  The internet came along  A little bit later  I finally joined Wackbag  In March  I put one post  On Wackbag  And I'm a freaking  Piece of meat  For piranhas  They went after me  Because I said  It's just friends  Having a fight  Don't you people  Have anything better to do 
[00:53:30]  They don't  We gotta get these people  Jobs man  They don't have  Anything better to do  Than to talk about you guys  All day long  On Wackbag  He said  They don't have  Anything better to do  That was his mistake  Yeah  You could say  You know  Oh it's just friends  Having a fight  And then people  Would have said that  But the second you say  You guys don't have  Anything better to do  Then you're gonna get pounced  Is this true  Has Elmo been suspended  From Wackbag  For two weeks  For bashing other members  For two weeks  Two weeks suspension  My brother will be  Just fine with that  My god  It made him feel good 
[00:54:00]  I guarantee it  Oh yeah  Well for a brother  A brother doesn't want  To log on  And just read  Like bashing  See that's my barometer  That's my barometer though  You know  You don't think  I left here Friday  Going oh my god  You're really losing it dude  You know  I mean I'm having  This inner conversation  With myself right  Yeah  And then I see  What my brother does  And stuff like that  I'm like okay  I'm still cool  I'm still alright  I'm not ready  For the mental home yet  You're insane at times  Here's my only  I actually have a clip  On the Opie  Jimmy soundboard  Alright  You better say  Jimmy versus Opie 
[00:54:30]  Soundboard  You better give him  Top billing  So no one looks  Too much into it  Right  Here's the only clip  Of me on this whole thing  Holy shit  And that says it all  Right there  My tone  What I said  Is exactly how I felt  Is that the only thing  You said  The only thing  Because I really don't  Remember you even  Talking during that  45-50 minutes  Trying to keep you guys  On track  I really don't remember  But they did a better job  Keeping that train  On track in Japan  Than I could ever 
[00:55:00]  Keeping this argument  On track  Here it is  Holy shit  Holy shit  Just an exhausted  Holy shit  I want to go home  Holy shit  Two and a half hours  Alright let's go to  Cigars and Scotch  From whackbag.com  I just want to make sure  I'm getting everything  Straight before I post  So Opie suspended  Jimmy for two days  Until Wednesday  Right Opie  You suspended him  I want to know  The reason he came  In barefoot  Was that  It's symbolic  That Jimmy should  Walk a day 
[00:55:30]  In his shoes  Wow  Alright I want to know  Whose side you took bro  I was leaning heavily  Towards Jimmy  Until I heard  Yoshi on the air  And then I was  Back to Opie  Man dude  If that wasn't  Some kind  Even if it meant  Nothing  Did you feel  Any kind of  Like you were  Exonerated  A little  When Yoshi  Was put on the air  Friday  And completely  Bombed  Maybe smile 
[00:56:00]  A little bit  Just a little  Oh my god  Hey we all love  Yoshi  My biggest frustration  Is that people  Don't understand  How this show works  And how you really  Have  You know  I unfortunately  Have to be the guy  That is like  The point guard  And I just knew  That Yoshi  Was going to stink  No offense to Yoshi  He's just  He's just too nervous  To do the show  Maybe the next time  Or a few  You know  A few appearances  Down the road  He'll be a lot better  And the way you get  That way  Is by coming in 
[00:56:30]  And hanging out  Like you sit  And you know  Whatever time we bring in  You sit there  You throw in a quip or two  During whatever  We're talking about  But to put him on  And go  Hey Yoshi  You know  Your act  Alright  What's your act all about  What are you doing  I'm just sitting there  Holy shit  Wow  Yeah  That was a little like  Uh oh  Yeah let's go  This is what we were  Kind of talking about 
[00:57:00]  Let's go to Oklahoma  Stanley what's up  Hey  I was just wondering  If y'all were going to  Play that argument  From Friday  Well  We got to figure out  How to replay it  Where it makes sense  Or something  I have no problem  With that  Well I was out  Unloading my truck  At the time  And I missed it  And I tried to  Catch it on replay  My brother-in-law  Told me about it  And I never did  Get to hear it  See that's why  Washington made a huge mistake  Because when you have  That type of radio  Going on  People 
[00:57:30]  You know  What you want to do  With a radio show  Is get people talking  Get people talking  So if you missed that fight  But you have friends  That heard it  They're of course  Going to tell you  Like oh my god  Did you hear those guys  Losing their minds  On the radio today  Well I did not  Well what channel  Was that on  And then you get  People to tune in  And then instead  They're hearing a dumb  Old Tommy Chong interview  That's just bad programming  Yeah  You know  I know I look like an ass  Jimmy looked like an ass  I don't care though  I knew it made for good radio  And that it would make  People tune in  So I know  I know there's already  Links up on 
[00:58:00]  I think  Whackbag.com  Foundrymusic.com  Might throw a link  To the fight  It's already  It's already  All over the internet  So  I'd like to have it  Replayed though  It's like  People should be able  To hear that  Yeah  Definitely  Alright Stanley  Well I hope y'all  Get to replay it  But I'm a first time caller  And I just want to say  I used to listen  To Howard Stern  All the time  And since I got y'all  Since that free  Replayed during Christmas  I had XM  And that's the reason  I got it  Y'all rock bud  And I'll budge it out  Thank you Stanley  Alright thank you  I really appreciate you 
[00:58:30]  That was a little sinister  Maybe on the east coast  We could play it  In the 6am hour  With Jimmy and I  You know  Doing an intro  And an outro  Or something like that  To give you guys  One more chance to get it  Yeah  Because a lot of people  Are just taping this show  On their MiFi anyway  That might be the way  To do it  I don't know  We'll figure out something  That'd be pretty cool  Pete in Queens  What's up?  Pete  What's going on?  No  The first replay  I heard  All you heard  Anthony say  The first thing  Coming out of break  Was 
[00:59:00]  I'm just going to  Sit here  And eat my sandwich  And then you two  Guys just go at it  Yeah yeah  Because I saw  It was going  I saw there was no way  We were doing the show  After that  So when we came back  From break  Before they even started  The on air portion  Of the argument  They had argued off air  And it was just too brutal  And I knew it was  Carrying over  So we come back  From break  And I just said  Well I'm going to  Eat my sandwich  Because I knew  It was over  Johnny  All right  Pete in Connecticut  We've got to move on here 
[00:59:30]  Pete  Yeah dude  It's so obvious  What's going on  Dude  Opie's not wearing shoes  Hello  Paul McCartney  Abbey Road  Dude  Opie is dead  To the show  Play the argument  Backwards  Dude  Play it backwards  Very good  If it wasn't so accurate  There's the photoshopper today  That's it  Dude  That's an easy one  It is obvious  Who's going to be  The first one  To photoshop that  On whackbag.com  With fucking Yoko Norton 
[01:00:00]  Sitting over there  Yeah they were calling him  Yoko  It was just  Yoko  It was just amazing  A bunch of asses  I love it  You asses  With your divide and conquer  It's just never going to happen  None of us are going anywhere  No  There's no power struggling  None of that crap  Okay  Stop  Don't worry about it so much  Just enjoy the program  Whether it's people yelling at each other  Or you're laughing your balls off  Just don't look so deeply  Into our personal psyches  And what everything means 
[01:00:30]  And Jimmy and I  Were already starting to goof  About the whole fight  Later on in that show  By the way  When we went to the bathroom  And we explained what happened  And we were kind of laughing  Through the whole thing  How awkward and silly it was  That usually we go to the bathroom  At the same time  Just because we both have  Weak bladders  Yeah  And we usually take leaks  Right next to each other  Wow the show's sounding  Pretty good today  Blah blah blah  We'll talk a little  Small talk right  And you know  We walked  We're like  Oh great  We both had to take a leak  At the same time  He goes to the urinals  I go in the stall  I go in the stall  Like you usually do  Sure  And I slam the stall 
[01:01:00]  We take our leaks  Right  And he's finished before me  So he's leaving the bathroom  Slams the door  Oh my god  Oh  Then we have to walk back in here  And then we had to acknowledge it  And we talked about it  On the air a little bit  Yeah  And if you listen  We were already starting to  You know  Kind of laugh about it  So  Move on  All right  Jesus  Okay  Let's go to Mike in Jersey  Mike what's up  Hey okay  Hey  I just wanted to know 
[01:01:30]  I mean because  The rest of the fight  You really didn't  Jay Moore pretty much  Took over the show  He went to break  And I just wanted to know  What was going through your head  It had to be like insane  Because it was like  Two brothers fighting  You know  That's why  It wasn't really insane  It was two really good friends  Fighting  Or two brothers fighting  I've had knockout  Fights with my own brothers  I'm from a big family  And I gotta tell you  It just felt really good  When that thing was over  And I could see it in Jim's eyes too  It was like  It was like this tension  That was building up  In both of us  That we needed to get out 
[01:02:00]  That probably didn't have much  To do with the other person  To be honest with you  In a weird way  I mean  The spark was lit  Because we had a disagreement  And I felt really really good  You know  The old days  I think I was telling Anthony  This over the weekend  I would hold a grudge  For fucking weeks  On bullshit stuff  And after the fight  I just was like  I felt really good  But the problem was  I had a really  Really bad headache  Really bad  And I just couldn't even  Focus or concentrate anymore  And that was the only reason  I even apologized to Anthony  I'm like  I told him over the weekend  I'm like  I didn't purposely mean 
[01:02:30]  To shut up the rest of the show  But I couldn't concentrate  Because I had one of those  Headaches where you can't even  Like see almost  Yeah  Where it hurts  Where the light hurts  It was almost like a migraine  It was cool  So I apologized to him  Because I'm like  I didn't mean to  You know  Throw you in that position  To totally just  Try to make something happen  That was cool  You know  But it worked out  I thought  Jay with the porno guy  And  I took some of that porno home  Yeah  Some of that  The facial stuff  Oh my god  Watch the whole thing 
[01:03:00]  Yeah  It's just brutal  These donut face chicks  Oh the  What the baker doesn't thing  Yeah  And there was one with  One of the girls  And I couldn't even watch it  She had a martini glass  Oh no  Yeah  Oh boy  Ten guys  Actually twelve guys  Oh boy  Into a martini glass  Oh boy  Yeah  Chug  Chug a lug  Let's go to Danny in New York  Danny what's up  Hey Opie  What's going on man  I didn't go on WAC there  But one of the other  Sight  I forgot what it was  But  They were just totally bashing you man 
[01:03:30]  The whole time  Like you won the argument over Norton  And I was like  Yeah man  Whatever man  It was just an argument  And it was no big deal man  Oh I will openly say  I don't think I won that argument by the way  Are you talking about opanthony.net  Yeah  Yeah  I just checked it out on the links man  They want me to post so bad on that site  And  Whenever I'm over there  It's just a  For some reason  It's an Opie bash fest  So I'm like  You know  I mean we still link them to all our websites  But  I don't really get it  I don't really get 
[01:04:00]  You know  What their agenda is over there  So  I don't get it man  They were just totally bashing you dude  And like  Like  Like  Like  Like  Like  It was like  Okay  You know  It was an equal fight  And you guys  Like  How do you think  To hash out  And  I don't get it man  They were just totally bashing you man  And I totally disagree with that man  Well I asked one stupid lousy thing  Just give me  Just some slight respect  Because this whole Opie and Anthony thing  Started with me many many years ago  That's it  Is that what it is?  Because it's like  Oh  Norton's better than Opie  And Opie and shit 
[01:04:30]  That's what you get  Dude  Dude  You run the show man  I mean you're the boss  And like  Well no no no  Not the boss anymore  You know what I mean  Oh another thing man  I met Lee Abrams  In Poughkeepsie  Believe it or not  Oh  Are you the  The  The air traffic control guy?  Holy shit  He told you about me?  Dude he  See I pay attention  He emailed me  He said you're a huge fan  I was a big fan  Dude  I've been listening to you since  N.E.W. man  Like in 98  Like  All right  Explain this to Anthony 
[01:05:00]  Because it is kind of cool  He's running the tower up there  In Poughkeepsie  Oh yeah  And Lee Abrams  Really high and stuff  Lands his plane  At your airport  Really high  He's not high when he flies  It was so funny man  Because like  I remember hearing you guys  Talking about it  At  In Vegas  And you were saying  Like it was 101XM  And it was a Sears plane  And I'm like  Okay  They're too cheap to get a jet  Or whatever  But then  Next thing you know  I get a trip  Like a flight trip  Whatever  We call the planes on  And I see 101XM  And I'm like  Okay cool man 
[01:05:30]  I don't think that's it  But whatever  They won't be landing  In Poughkeepsie dude  We're in the middle of nowhere  Next thing you know  They land  And I talk to the guys  That fuel the plane  And I go  Okay  Are these the XM guys  And they call me up  And they said  Yeah they also ran over there  And I started giving them shit  About you guys saying  They had narcolepsy  And all that other shit  Narcoleptic pilot  And it was funny  He was just laughing  He goes  I won meeting  And then next  You know my career  Screwed  And I was cracking up  And they had these  Two hot chicks  With him man  He did? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah dude  I guess one of them  Is  Who's the CEO again  I forgot his name  Hugh  What?  Hugh Pinero  Hugh Pinero  Hugh Pinero's secretary  Gorgeous  And the other chick  I thought was Kathy Griffin  Because she looked like Kathy Griffin  It's not that hot  But I was like  I'm pretty good  So Lee Abram was flying around  With two hot broads?  Definitely dude  Oh that's the whore bait  That he carries  Rockstar  Yes man  He's got that whore bait  Man  He carries a nice  A nice amount of cocaine  Better known as whore bait 
[01:06:30]  He must have kept me awake  From the narcolepsy  He gave me his car  What better way not to  They were totally spreading the word  They were total XM whores  Man they had the jackets on  The whole nine  I had to go meet him man  Because I heard him on the show  He had to talk to his balls  It was funny as hell man  He's still going  He's used to it  Well my line has passed now  But thank you bro  I really appreciate it  Dude  How was his landing?  Nice?  The landing was perfect  Everything was cool  What a guy  I thought he might have fallen asleep  And just crashed it 
[01:07:00]  And shit  I had to call the fire trucks  But thanks for taking my call man  I appreciate it  Hi man  Well I wish I did  But thank you Danny  It's lonely up in that town  Talking to planes all day  It's nice that he actually  Has something else to say  Poor planes crashed  While he was talking to us  Fucking idiot  Piled up on top of each other  Mark in Michigan  What's up?

[01:13:30]  I stand alone  Anthony and Jimmy  Bye  Alright, I see where you're going  Jesus Christ  Coming out of the next break  I'm going to play Nine Inch Nails  Head Like a Hole  Oh  Bow down  That's right  Before the one you serve  Yes  You're going to get what you deserve  People on the board  Are hysterical  Really fast, let's go to Long Island  Justin, what's up? 
[01:14:00]  Hey, fellas, what's going on?  Hey, man  Two things for you, man  When that fight hit  I'll tell you right now  I work for Cablevision  Not a single bit of cable work went on  While everyone sat in their truck  And listened to it, man  I know  That's why they should have replayed it  As opposed to  I know  What did you say, Ant?  I said as opposed to what?  When all the Cablevision work is being done  You motherfuckers  You gotta love it, guys  But I just wanted to ask Ant  If it brought back any repressed memories  Before his parents got divorced 
[01:14:30]  A lot of people ask me that  If hearing Jimmy and Opie arguing  Brought back those memories  Because, you know, I grew up in a household  Where my mother and father  Were constantly fighting with each other  And throwing the pasta dish at the wall  And watching it slowly slide down  And, yeah, there was a little bit of that  You know, going at it  Where, you know, two people  That you see on a daily basis  You have a relationship with  Are arguing like that  You kind of feel a little, you know  Unbelievable  Like, oh, this is uncomfortable 
[01:15:00]  All I felt was you sitting in the corner  Sucking your thumb  Crying for it to be over  I'm punching out, man  That was pretty much it  Alright, Justin  So, um  We're all going to the taping tomorrow night  The GenNHBO taping  And we're going to change our schedule  Around a little bit  I think we're going to try to do  The show Wednesday  9 a.m.  To 1 p.m.  East Coast time  Which means all U.S. coasters  Will be live in morning drive  Wednesday morning, it looks like  There you go  For you guys  Throw them a little bone  So, uh 
[01:15:30]  On the East Coast  9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Wednesday  So we can sleep in a little bit  Because it's going to be  A really late night tomorrow night  Yeah  So, I figured  I'm going to stay in town  It would be stupid for me  To try to drive in  I'd have to get up earlier  Than I get up now  In order to get into New York City  By 9 o'clock  That's the heat of rush hour  So, uh  I figured  I'll stay in town  So, uh  This morning  I go to make reservations  To stay  In the city  And I call up the hotel  But 
[01:16:00]  Their front desk  To take reservations  Not open this early  Wah, wah, wah  So she goes  Well, I can hand you off  To our entire  Hotel chain  Reservation service  I'm like  Oh, that's good  I'll do that  I'll just make a reservation there  Uh  The connection's really bad  I'm trying to listen to the guy  And  And all I'm getting  It's  It's really bad  Hello  You're on a main reservation  Yeah 
[01:16:30]  I can barely hear you  Yeah  Well  There's a main connection here  But  Do you like to make a reservation?  Yeah  I'm staying  Uh  Tuesday  Two people  Or one person  Two people  Uh  Hello  Hello  Hello  Hello  Oh  And now the guys in the office  See that I'm getting all pissed off  I'm starting to get a little pissed 
[01:17:00]  I'm like  A little?  Yeah, I know  Very pissed  They call me a psycho  When it comes to stuff not going your way  I can't handle it  Can you hear me?  I know  I'm like  Whoa, hey  Well then he goes  We're all right  We're each out of the room  It's a  King bed  No smoking  It's  Thank you  I'm going to  Do you have to  This is five dollars  You can't  Like  Yeah, king bed  Yeah  Yes, I'll take it  Okay, king bed

He goes  Are you in the United States?  And that's what I'm  I  I was  Yes  I'm in England  England? 
[01:18:00]  I make  Dude  What am I looking at right now?  I think you're looking at the hotel  That you want to stay at  I'm looking out my window  At the hotel I wanted to stay at  Tomorrow night  It's right there  It's right there  Why do I have to call England  To make a reservation?  It's England  The guy couldn't hear me  It's the hotel's right there  Right there  He's just looking out the window  Across the street  We've reached a point where 
[01:18:30]  And we've had it here at XM too  We've had the same problem where  They put a little too much thought  Into the technology  And we've got to get back to our  You know  The roots of things  Keep it simple  We've gotten to the point  In this society  Where it's just  Gotten insane  Why in God's name  Does my call  Have to go thousands of miles  To make a reservation  That is across the street  And I can't even hear the guy talking 
[01:19:00]  It stunned me  And how I ended the call  I took my little cell phone  And threw it on my desk  And went  Fuck this  That was it  That's how the call ended  So now you'll be staying  At another hotel  I don't know  Actually  I kind of like that hotel  So I want to make reservations there  What about customer service?  Are they open right now?  Most of the customer service calls  Go to like  I don't know  India or something  Yeah  Baby  Call the hotel  And book a room  Thank you 
[01:19:30]  A little message going on  Over there  Secret message  Beep beep beep beep  Beep beep beep beep  Done  Tuesday  There we go  Alright  But it's just  Yeah a lot of the tech things  Go to India  That's right here  Customer service  Yeah  There is a whole industry  In India now  You call the customer service  And it's  Yeah  It's somewhere else  It's not in the United States  Most of the time  I saw a show on  There's a whole industry  Now in India  Where they're teaching people 
[01:20:00]  To get rid of their Indian accents  And speak more American  Like as far as their  Not just the language  Obviously  But the inflections  And everything like that  They don't want  People have a problem  With their computer  So they're trying to get rid of it  Because  There's such a demand  For these  These customer service lines  In India  Why is that?  Why can't we have customer service  That isn't a long distance call  To some far away land  Because it's cheaper  Is it cheaper?  Is that what it is?  Yeah that's all it is 
[01:20:30]  Well you know  It makes it a real pain in the ass  They pay them a lot less Anthony  It makes it a real pain in the ass  To do anything in this country anymore  When you call  And finally do get the live person on the line  How often is that person an American  That you can understand?  It is so rare  That after going through that  That half an hour long  Of the beep beep  Line one  Oh press two  Press three  You finally get through  To the live person  After waiting on hold  All our operators 
[01:21:00]  Whoever came up with that idea  Should be executed by the way  Oh  That just proves your company  Doesn't give a flying fuck  No  About your customers  But it's commonplace now  Well if you're calling from  You know  Yeah all that stuff  Push one  If you're doing this  Push two  If you need to  Check on your account  Push three  If you need to check on your account  But it's not Tuesday  Press four  And it just keeps going  And going  And going  And you never get to a live person  That drives me nuts  And then you don't hear your options sometimes  Like this  What do I 
[01:21:30]  And then I just go  Ah zero  I hit zero  Hope to get an operator  No  It takes you back to something else  It is so god damn annoying  And then when you finally do get a live person  It's  You know  Some accent  You can't understand  How could you have a tech person  Or a customer service person  That you can't understand  Microsoft tech support is in India  I guess the Philippines  India is a big thing  Call center is in Jamaica  I've gotten a few of those too  Hello  Yeah we're in Jamaica  What 
[01:22:00]  Why are  You calling about this  Modem isn't working  Why  Jamaica  What are you  The woman's got a bowl of fruit on her head  And she's going to talk me through this problem  Steve's in studio  You know a little bit about this  Oh it's the  It's classic  A lot of internet companies do it  A lot of the major tech companies do it  Basically you send  There are firms now  That will help you set up a call center  In the Philippines  India  Jamaica  And they'll set up language courses  They'll set up the actual staffing 
[01:22:30]  And they'll teach you how to use this stuff  And it's basically no more than  Handing the person a binder  Full of lines  And data  And  It's got to be like a script  And a flow chart  Okay are you getting  A picture in your monitor  Right  Is it  Okay now we'll go to this  Is it plugged in  It's the same sheet  You get with any  Troubleshooting sheet  You would get with a computer  And  You're not getting a tech guy  That knows  The deal  And can go  Alright dude  I know what the problem is  Punch this in  Go to this  And help you out  Yeah 
[01:23:00]  And they're saving a fortune  On labor costs  So it costs less  To send a whole  To send a person over there  Or to send a group of people over there  Buy a building  Build a building  Staff it with people  And then pay them  You know  Pennies  To do all of the work  That would have cost you  A lot more in this country  It drives me crazy  Someone is saying that  XM does the same thing  Jamaica  What?  Is that what they ask?  Yeah  Did you reboot?  I love that one  Did you reboot?  Oh  I'll reboot up your ass  He said he called 
[01:23:30]  Customer service one day  And got  And was speaking to a woman  And he caught  A little bit of an accent  You know because  Again  They do train  To  They do try to  Lose their accents  So  But Jamaican  Mike  I was picking up my car  He said  Do you guys have  A customer service department  In Jamaica?  Because he was on the phone  And he caught a little  Something  And he asked the woman  On the phone  He said  Are you Jamaican?  Yes I'm in Jamaica right now  And he was like  Ah  There you go  That is bad  I also like  Cable vision  Whenever I call  Cable vision  With a problem

That's what I want  Not may I help you  I don't want  May I help you  We've just reached a point  Where it's just  Futile  We love our technology  Believe me  And I mean  Thank God  I have been afforded 
[01:25:30]  The luxury  Obi  I have been blessed  In this life  With an occupation  That gives me  Another option  To throw it  The fuck  Away  And buy  A new one  Because I can't  Imagine  My monitor  Went on the fritz  About two weeks ago  I turned it on  It made a  Boop  Sound  Powered up  And went black  Just nothing  Nothing  That's not good  So I'm jiggling the wires  I change things around  I do that  And you know what I finally did 
[01:26:00]  Fuck it  I unplugged it  I went to Dell  I got a new  I got a new monitor  But you know  I would have been on there  I would have been  Maybe sending it back  God if you guys  For the people that  Don't make a lot of money  You guys should just  Camp out  Outside Anthony's house  There you go  Camp out  I mean you could get  A couch that has  One lousy stupid  Booger  Somewhere on it  You can get a monitor  What else do you  Just throw away  Because you don't  Feel like fixing it  Alright about a month ago  My girlfriend's computer  Was really overheating 
[01:26:30]  And it started crashing  To the blue fatal screen  And there was a problem  With an overheating problem  So I opened it up  Apparently there was  A lot of dust in the fan  And one of the fan motors  By the power pack  Petered out  So the power pack itself  It heated up so much  That it burnt out  Now instead of getting  A new power pack  I had another  PC laying around  So I just took  The hard drive  Out of her computer  Put it in this  Older computer  Where the power pack 
[01:27:00]  Was good  It's almost like  If you got a flat  Take your remaining  Good tires off  And put it on a new car  With one good tire  That's pretty much  What I did  And took the computer  Then with everything else  In it  And the bad power pack  Out on the street  Goodbye  Because I can  Yes  Yes Steve  I cannot deal with  I can't deal  Maybe $50  Worth of a part  Maybe  I needed it fixed then  Throw it away  See this is the difference  Of  People can do 
[01:27:30]  Drive by  You know  Drive by your house  And get some really nice stuff  They probably could  When I have a problem  When I have a problem  Not only do I  I put it outside  But I have to smash it  You got to smash it  Just because of the anger  You don't want  You remember  When we were moving to Boston  And you showed up  At my apartment  And I was just  In mid  Smashing  Everything I owned  When I pulled up  You actually  Were spinning  A VCR  Over your head  By the cord  Like a lasso  And then you 
[01:28:00]  Threw it out  On the street  And laughed  At the way it crashed  And I'm like  Oh my god  I'm basing my life  On this guy  Yeah  It was quite frightening  You know  I had okay stuff  Back in the day  But when we were  Moving to Boston  I knew I just wanted  To buy all new stuff  You know  And instead of  Leaving it all nice  On the curb  Where maybe  Somebody else might get it  Maybe someone  A little less unfortunate  Could drive by  And have a  Just a  Great day  I'm like 
[01:28:30]  Screw that  I just  Just smash it  You're not getting it  If I can't have it  I used to  That was the way  I got my  Televisions  When I used to  I used to rent like  You know  Room for rent  And upstairs  In a house  Kind of a thing  Yeah  Where there was  You know  Two rooms up there  And someone else  Would rent another room  And the people  Would live downstairs  You'd have your  Separate entrance  Kind of thing  But in essence  You're living in a room  With like a hot plate  Kind of arrangement  Red neon sign  Blinking outside  And to get a television  I would drive around  On the weekends 
[01:29:00]  And just look for one  On the street  I would grab up  About three of them  Bring them upstairs  Try them  If one of them worked  Or needed a part  Maybe I could grab off  Another one  Yeah  I would do that  And that's how I got  My televisions  For many years  That was it  I got my whole  Dorm room that way  Well not even the dorm room  When I was living  In the fraternity house  Every  You know  The end of the summer  Is coming  The semester's about to begin  Rent a big  Like a van or something  And just drive around  All the neighborhoods  Like up  There's the couch  Did you get the big  Wooden spool  Electrical wire spool 
[01:29:30]  To use as a table  Man  Yeah  There's the wooden spool  Hey some milk crates  Right  Those will be my  Night tables  And I would just  Collect all this stuff  Drive all the way up  To Geneseo  And make it work  Yeah  Oh yeah  Every year  Steal a couple signs  Yeah  You find some good stuff  In there when you're  You know  Just starting out  No one's going to miss  That stop sign  Nah  Great for the wall  Great wall decoration  No one's going to miss  That stop sign  Leading to 25A  Screw it  You know  Yeah 
[01:30:00]  Definitely  I would do that  Every summer  Just before the semester  Would start  That was it  Sometimes you look out  You get a nice mattress too  That was a little  Alright  I was going to say  Never in all my day  I was going to say  That's a little tricky  I understand  You know  You got to make sure  The stains aren't that bad  And that you can maybe  Flip it over  No I was never able  To afford a mattress  Where did I get my bedding from  I had absolutely no money man  Ew  That's right  I actually got my grandma's bed  Which is kind of sick  When you think her and grandpa 
[01:30:30]  Were fucking on it for a while  Steve ripped his headphones off  Screw it  Wait Steve  I can't hear that  No screw that  You know the grandparents  Effing that's whatever  But what about later in life  When they were just losing  Their bowels in the middle of the night  No she wasn't doing that  Yeah how do you know  Grandma wasn't crapping the bed  How do you know  You see stains  I know  How do you know  I know grandma wasn't like that  Not when I got that bed  That's for sure  Yeah  She wasn't all that old  Which leads me to believe  There might have been some  You know grandma grandpa action 
[01:31:00]  Going on on the bed  I should have checked it  With a black light  I'm thinking maybe  A little butt sex  No stop it  Or a little crime scene sex  No  Nice  No it was just the basic  Missionary position  To show their appreciation  For each other  Are you insane  That's all it was  There was nothing kinky going on  Grandpa would get back  From the trotters at the track  He'd come up  And you know  Maybe he hit a horse  Hey kids  You think you're  Feel good  And feel like now  He's got to hit grandma  Hey kids  You think you're a young stud  You know all those  Crazy positions you try in bed 
[01:31:30]  Your grandparents  Did the exact same thing  No  Of course they did  It's pure missionary  Of course they did  That's it  Just to show that  They appreciate each other's company  For so many years  And then they're done  Actually never even left  Any stains on the bed  Your grandma did  Backward cowgirl  No  Yes she did  Never ever  Ever  Was there a backward cowgirl  Involved  She was probably doing it  Well into her 60's  You're a mad person 
[01:32:00]  That is not  That never happened  Have you ever seen  Old stag films  Sure  I mean I'm not  I'm not suggesting  Anything personal  I'm just saying  Old stag films  If now they're transferring  Them to DVD  You can see that  All of these twisted  Sexual positions  Existed back in the 20's  Right when the  Kinetoscope was being  Yeah we think  We're coming up  With new ones  Stop  It was just for  Making kids  And then maybe  The kinkiest stuff  Was left for the  Gumar  That was  That was a hard job  I came to a realization 
[01:32:30]  That older people  Grandparents  Were still very very horny  When I was driving  On I-95  With my grandma  85 years old  Yeah  Before or after  You tongue kissed her  A few years after  I tongue kissed her  Do the people  Even know that story  So it's a little more  Innocent than it sounds  People  So we'll just let it  Sit there  That's the beauty  Of this show  Speculate about that  Assholes  You might be asking  How the hell  Did uh  How the hell 
[01:33:00]  Is it innocent  If Opie tongue kissed  His grandma  I was just uh  You know my grandma  Was around a lot  And I was uh  Giving her a kiss  Good night  And uh  I had my mouth open  That's all  And I got closer  And closer to my grandma  With my mouth opened  And there may have been  A little tongue action  By accident  Pretty much  And she yelled at me  And said  Close your fucking mouth  I didn't know  I was just a little  Little boy  Yeah  Little boy  But anyway  We're on I-95 
[01:33:30]  My grandma  At the time  Was 85  My dad was in  The veterans hospital  Having his  Quadruple bypass surgery  So we had to go up there  To see him  Because it was the best  Hospital at the time  Blah blah blah  And uh  We're on I-95  And there's a car  In the grandma lane  Basically right  Going really really slow  And I noticed  Oh my god  This guy's getting road head  Holy ass  Which is so freaking cool  When you see shit like that 
[01:34:00]  On the highway  When you're traveling  Right  And uh  So I think my  Either my sister  Or I had a couple brothers  There were more people  In the car  And we're all like  Oh wow  Jesus look at this  You know  And of course  You know  You gotta check it out  So we're slowing down  And checking out  And stuff  And I looked at my grandma  She had the biggest  Freaking smile on her face  She was enjoying  The hell  Really  Oh yeah  Because I guarantee  Her mind was in overdrive  Thinking about all the crazy  Stuff she did in her life  You think one time  Guaranteed  The old Model T  Was going  Yeah  Horse and buggy 
[01:34:30]  Why don't you come over here  Light up a lucky  Head in the lap  And the Model T  And that's when I looked  At my grandma  And thought  Man  If the circumstances  Were right  My grandma  Would want some action still  And she was 85  At the time  I mean the smile  The enjoyment  Really  She got such enjoyment  Knowing that was going on  Right next to us  On the highway  Well when they break out  The old photo album  You ever have that whole thing  Where you're with your 
[01:35:00]  Grandparents  And they break out  The old photo album  And you're looking through  Those old black and white pictures  With the frayed looking edges  And the date on the bottom  And it's you know  From the 20's or 30's  And it's them at the beach  And you see your grandmother  Like smiling and laughing  With guys hanging out  And they're on the beach  In their bathing suits  And they're cone tits  But you know  They were like  You know  They're having a good time 
[01:35:30]  And the guys  Are looking at the girls  And they got sex  On their minds  It would be their  Swimming bloomers though  Their bloomers  I'm not talking like  The 1890's  The gay 90's  To get bathing suits  From the 20's  You know  Come on  Well the 30's  They had those torpedo  Kind of top thing going  And that  And they're kind of  They're laying back  On the towel  With their arms behind them  And their head  Thrown back  Their raven hair  Flowing in the wind  Kind of thing  And you look and go  No that wasn't the wind  That was all the sperm 
[01:36:00]  In their hair  They were down the beach  Just before that picture  Was taken  And they were having  Monkey sex  No not on the beach  You don't think your grandma  Might have had sex  On a beach  No  Oh are you insane  No  You're insane  It was oil  From the assembly line  Putting together  Those P-51 Mustangs  We'll push the Hun  Back to Berlin  That's what it was  Yeah but they  And you look at those pictures  And it does come to your mind  Like wow  These people were 
[01:36:30]  They were real people  You know  You don't think  Of your grandparents  As real people  Because they're such  Grandparents  They're just older people  And then you look at them  In that setting  And they're just  You know  Just like you were  Going out  Looking for a good time  Looking to get laid  Looking to get high  Looking to  You know  Just have fun  And it's kind of  You don't really think about it  Until you look at those pictures  Oh here's me  And this is a guy  That I dated  Yeah  Let's translate  You  You fuck this guy  This guy might have been grandpa 
[01:37:00]  Oh  You don't want to hear  About stuff like that  Oh I was very attracted  To this boy  Yeah  Very attracted to him  This boy had a crush on me  Oh  He used to jack off to you  Grandma  Is that what you're saying  Oh  Yeah they just made it sound  A lot nicer back then  That's all  That's it  They made it sound nicer  And they dressed a lot nicer  Nicer choice of words  Making you think that  This craziness wasn't going on  And their names  Didn't sound hot  They woke up on a Sunday morning  And they  And they put a suit on 
[01:37:30]  Yeah  What the hell was that about  A suit  On a Sunday morning  Gotta be insane to do that  This was my friend  All the boys were crazy  For Gertrude  They all loved Gertie  Here's my friend Mildred  Who was real hot stuff  Mildred was never hot  Never  Alright  Steve  Yeah  What was going on  In your mind on Friday  When that crap was going down  Yeah  Jesus  Well you know  We talked  You and I talked about this  On Friday night 
[01:38:00]  And it was  I think Anthony and Ben  And I looked at each other  And we knew exactly  What was going on  When it was happening  I mean there wasn't  Really a whole lot of  You know  Thought going on  There was like  Alright  It's happening  You know  Because everybody  In these situations  You either  You either talk about  What's bugging you  When it's bothering you  Or you bottle it up  And you let it stew  And eventually  There's something  Someone says one comment  And it's basically  The straw that breaks  The camel's back  And that's when 
[01:38:30]  Everything comes out  That's a good point  By the way  Which you made too  You said this has  Obviously been brewing  For a long time  And you guys  Really need to talk  Yeah  Steve's so right  You know  Both of us  Have just been  Holding something inside  Yeah  Little quips and jabs  Every so often  But like you said  If both of your switches  Aren't in the on position  Then you just blow it off  One or the other  Will just say  Yeah we can make  Some of this  But  And on Friday  It just happened  That both switches  Were up and armed  And ready to go  And it was just 
[01:39:00]  Cannons going back and forth  This is why  This is why bands  That have been together  For years  Hire therapists  You know  Metallica was really  The only people  That figured out  That you could videotape it  And make money off of it  I gotta tell you something  Watching some kind of monster  That brought  Everything in perspective  With me  Because I mean  A lot of the stuff  That went on in that movie  You know  And I have had  Some of those growing pains  Over the years  And stuff  And it was just so good  To know that  You know  Someone else out there  Goes through that  Yeah  Because no one ever  Really exposed that  Before  Before Metallica did 
[01:39:30]  Right  I mean  But bands have been  Doing it for years  Aerosmith hired therapists  Megadeth hired therapists  But I mean  To actually see it on film  You know  Where they're calling  Each other assholes  All the dirt  Oh man  If you haven't seen  Some kind of monster yet  I highly recommend that movie  It's just really  Really interesting  Yeah  I mean  You've got this  Situation where you've got  All these very strong personalities  And you're spending  A lot of time together  In a confined space  And you're not always  Going to agree  And sometimes  The reactions can get  So volatile  And you just hope to God  I remember Ben and I 
[01:40:00]  Were just sitting there  And it's like  Watching your parents fight  It really is  There's two people  That you care about  That you're friends with  And they're just saying  Vicious  Horrible shit  To one another  And you're just  Hoping to God  That one of them  Pulls back  And moves on  Before they say  Something that they  Really regret  I don't know  Dickhead  Because I don't know  What was going on  That day  Fuckface  Everyone enjoying  The Jimmy vs. Opie  Soundboard  Jimmy and I  Laughed about that  Part of the argument  By the way  On Saturday  When we talked  We were like 
[01:40:30]  God we said  Some really dumb  Vicious stuff  That is so  Sociopathic  I almost don't know  How to respond to it  You know what  I noticed  And I'm sure  Anthony picked up on this  When you think  Of all the horrible  Things you've heard  Jimmy say  When he's mad  At somebody  You notice  How restrained  He was  Yeah  Incredibly restrained  Well believe it or not  I was too  I know  But still  I mean he was  You know  I mean he was  Almost  Because no why  Because in the end  We respect each other  And we are friends  And I believe 
[01:41:00]  We wouldn't go down  That road  You're convinced  Hugh Pinero hates  The show right  Are you really  On the air  Trying to throw me  Under the bus  With Hugh Pinero  Well now if you want  Oh  Holy shit  Whoever came over  That brilliant man  I think you can get  To it through  Whackbag.com  Yeah we put up  Links too  You can make  Your own argument  Alright  And the other thing  I wanted to ask you  Do we have the  Jimmy Stewart  Customer service call  We played  It's from the old days  We had a version of it 
[01:41:30]  But it kind of just ends  We never got another  Version of that  I can record  A good version  We don't have it  I liked a lot of those  Customer service calls  Not the Jimmy Stewart one  The other ones  Where people call up  And the cup holder one  That was a famous one  Where somebody said  That they can't get  Their cup holder back in  And it turned out  That it was their  Disc drive  Oh yeah  Yeah  And the foot pedal  Isn't working  And that was the mouse  He put it on the floor  And was using it  As a foot pedal  I'm sure some of the

[01:49:30]  The virus  Is spreading  XM202  The O.B. and Anthony show  Travis  You're like Travis huh  He is the best  Right before we went to break  You know how short our breaks are here  The second we went into break  I had  You hear this 
[01:50:00]  This is the  The small can of club soda  That Ricky  Had gotten me  That took 40 minutes  To bring back  This morning  I was out of  Club soda  So I needed another  We go to break  I go  I could use another club soda  Travis comes in  Grabs my money  Leaves  Right when we got back  On the air  He's running into the studio  Hands me  My icy cold bottle  Of club soda  Within minutes  I mean  Unbelievable  That kid's a go getter 
[01:50:30]  What a go getter  He's a go getter  And Ricky  Is  Well he's Ricky  I hear he's failing out of school  And everything  Over this internship  Yeah  What is he doing  He's  Alright grab that mic  What do you know about Ricky  He's interning here  And for some reason  He's blowing off  Everything else in his life  I heard some things  Heard he's  Not doing well  In  College  He's doing really bad  His GPA  Is way down  And  Apparently he's not really 
[01:51:00]  Giving a crap  Because he's more concerned  About doing the internship  Than fixing his college stuff  Well he thinks I guess  That this internship  Is going to do what  Get him a job  Lead to somewhere  Is that what he thinks  One would assume  Anthony  Yeah  Because people expect it from me  This is where we want to change roles  Oh really  And we want people to realize  That you're  You're a lot like me as well  I don't know if I have it in me though  You've got to tell him  He's going nowhere  Because I don't want him  To wreck his whole life  I'll try to be a little diplomatic  About it  Yeah you're a little better  I don't know if I can be nasty 
[01:51:30]  You're a little better than I  But what are we going to  Try to put a point  Put across the point that  He really is going nowhere  In this line of work  Like if his dream is to be  Let's find out what he wants  To do in radio  Where's Ricky  Where is Ricky  He's out right now  He's out  What is he doing now  He's on some sort of errand  What kind of errand is he on  I love knowing what he's  Dude I gotta tell you  There's something else  Going on here  You know  People  You guys are dicks too 
[01:52:00]  I really gotta start  Showing everybody  That I'm not the only dick  That works on this radio show  They fuck with Ricky  All the time  Yeah  That's been what  The day last week  Where I just shook my head  I'm like  What are you doing  The newspapers  You know the big couch  Outside our office  Uh huh  I guess uh  There's a pile of newspapers  Okay  Yeah  Am I exaggerating  If I say it's two to three feet high  It's about two weeks worth 
[01:52:30]  Of newspapers  Two weeks of uh  Newspapers  And for us  That's a lot of papers  Well cause it's  It's the New York Times  Newsday  Daily News  New York Post  And then there was a bunch  Of Boston papers in there  New York Times  Is that a paper here  In this instance  Yeah well  Be damned if I've never  Cracked that one open  He's getting  He's getting a  CAT5 cable for Mars  Cat5 cable  Oh my god  Are you insane  He's getting a  Cat5 cable for Mars  He might as well  Go to Mars 
[01:53:00]  To try to get it  Cause this  He is not gonna come back  With the right cable  Oh no  Do you realize  He's gonna go to a pet store  We didn't send him  Mars sent him  He's gonna come back  With a kitten  Do you realize  This guy  With five of them  This guy's gonna have  Five kittens  Are you insane  What I  You guys  Why am I  I keep saying  Are you insane  You guys wanted five cats  Why would you  Send him to go get  A CAT5 cable  Well I wrote the  Specifics down  Because that helps  That helps  I can't wait  To see the outcome  Of this  Oh my 
[01:53:30]  It cannot be right  How long ago  Did he leave  About 15 minutes  15 minutes  And where did he have to go  Comp USA  Half a block  Oh my god  Staples  It's right on the corner  Yeah it's right on the corner  Is it Staples right here  Yeah  57th and 6th  How about that  He is wandering around  Right now  Looking for a pet store  I'm telling you  Anyway  So  I forgot what day it was  It was like Thursday or Friday  Last week  There was a huge stack of papers  And Ricky's sitting there  And he's halfway through the stack  This was the day we had to deal  With the whole channel blocking issue 
[01:54:00]  So we were here a long time  We didn't get out of here  Until like 1230  What issue was there  With channel blocking  I don't remember anymore  So  It's not an issue  Why is it always gotta be an issue  Sorry I was trying to get something going  A little heated argument  With me  Yeah  Good luck  So  We finally  Are leaving an hour and a half  After the show ends  And I see Ricky outside the office  And there's a huge stack of papers  And he's going through every paper 
[01:54:30]  And he's only halfway done  So there's still a half a stack  On the couch  And a huge half a stack  On the floor  The ones he went through already  And I'm like  What are you doing?  He's like  I'm trying to find the Opie and Anthony  Advertising  You know  Because they did full page ads  For our show  Yeah  This goes back a week or so ago  So I guess Ben  Basically told them  To find the  The full page ad  Because we wanted to save it  Or something  It was some busy work  But here's the problem  It wasn't in any of those papers 
[01:55:00]  No we already had them  They were somewhere else  Oh no  This is what they do to the kid  Just to mess with them  And as I'm walking out  Ben walks by  And goes  Don't worry Ricky  It's in there  Keep looking  And it was obvious  He was at it for  I don't know  Half hour  40 minutes possibly  It was time for his hazing  He needed his hazing  These guys  We were all in on it  He's been getting a hazing  The whole time  Dude they're all in on it  So they're all giggling  Behind his back and stuff  And there's Ricky  Here give me a  This is it  Just over and over again  And with Ben 
[01:55:30]  Like just looking over  And going  Don't worry it's in there  Keep looking  Oh then and Danny  Sending them out  To get different newspapers  And Steve sending them  To get stuff  And the guy is not smart enough  To know that they're just  Acting with him  And everyone's laughing  Just when you think  That people kind of  Grow up and mature  It just  It never ends  It never ends  For the guy in gym class  That just got smashed in the face  With the dodgeball  Every time  He's that guy  Just never ends  For the guy  That you used to just 
[01:56:00]  When he's trying to walk home  The books got thrown  In the puddle  You make him do the push-ups  Over the piece of shit  Laying in the field  It just  That doesn't go away  He's still  Like it's still  In the workplace  It just  It probably happens  In fucking retirement homes  They're still ragging on people  Probably  Probably the old guy  Is like  They goof on him  They steal his bedpan  They  You know  It just doesn't end  I kind of feel bad for him  They're probably all in  Like the rec room 
[01:56:30]  Yeah  In their wheelchairs  And you got four or five  Knowing one guy is gullible  Going no man  The hot nurse  She's waiting for you  In your room right now  And he wheels all the way  Down to his room  Yeah  Comes back  No she's down  You know  In the TV room  Just setting them  All over the  Waiting for you  Down there  They like wipe shit  On his shuffleboard  Stick handle  Look at he's touching it  You make a good point  I think you go to your grave  Just goofing the whole way  There's always just 
[01:57:00]  The weak person  The person that is just  Meant to be goofed on  Through life  And it's just  I feel bad for the kid  You know  And the only saving grace here  Is he is young enough  Where eventually  That might change  Because you have seen  Little geeky people  That grow up  And kind of make  Some of themselves  Bill Gates is a great example  But you know  I don't know  It's looking grim  It's looking grim for him  You're going to have  A conversation with him  We'll have a little conversation  I want to find out  What he wants to do  And how this internship 
[01:57:30]  Is going to help him  Propel him into this goal  And you know  It might not work out  Hey where's Travis  I've got to ask him  About something too  Watch Travis will be here  In seconds  This guy's a go-getter  Travis is good  Watch this  He's motivated  Travis  I have one question for you  Were you in the  I'll call it the third row  Were you in the third row  Of the Opie and Anthony  Press conference  When we were at the  Hard Rock Cafe  Yes  Oh  He was 
[01:58:00]  Yes I was there  And I believe Nathaniel  Was there as well  Yeah but we didn't know  You back there  No  Oh I didn't know you  You knew Nathaniel as well  Why  Nothing bad  It creeped me out a little bit  It creeped you out  I'll tell you why  Because we now know Travis  He's an intern here  And he does an unbelievable job  You really do  Thank you  You're on top of everything  That we ask you to do  But I finally  You know  Took my digital camera  And I got all the pictures  Printed up right  Oh wow  And you spotted them  Oh my gosh  And I got copies for you 
[01:58:30]  Whatever  And I keep forgetting  To bring them in  Someone has to remind me  I'll bring them in tomorrow  Because this will be  Kind of funny  Yeah  And remember when  We were doing our huge  XM announcement  At the Hard Rock Cafe  Announcing we're going  To satellite radio and stuff  Yeah  And I took  My brother was taking  Pictures for me  All over the room  And you know  Documenting the day  Because it was a huge day  For us obviously  Well I asked my brother  Who was in the front row  I'm like  Give me the camera  So I take a couple pictures  Of the crowd right  So I'm going through  These pictures  No big deal  You know  It's our whole tour  And everything  And I come upon  The picture that I took 
[01:59:00]  From the stage  From the podium  And there's Travis  As obvious could be  Like dead center  Of the audience  Staring at us  Like he's a psycho fan  And I'm like  Oh my god  I think we might have  Hired a stalker  No I went  I went actually  To ask you guys  About internships  Ah  Oh okay  And I did  Yeah actually  You did ask  Yeah  Oh I had no idea  Yeah  But also  I'm like  I know that  Oh my god  He now works for us  It was just  This weird thing  That there he is 
[01:59:30]  All there  Smiling  Pretty much  Very close to the stage  Nathaniel was there too  Yeah  And didn't you  Did you  Yeah come on in here  Because I gotta ask  Nathaniel something  I think he might have  Spoken to me  Oh really  Nathaniel you spoke  Did you speak to me  That day  About an internship  Yes I spoke to both of you  Yes you did  Actually  I completely was  Very nice to you  I was like  Yeah let me take your info  And then I completely  Blew him off  Yeah  Yeah I didn't  Sorry  Didn't hear  Hide no hair  I didn't take it personally  But he 
[02:00:00]  You had worked at the Bone  Yes  Oh I remember  Talking to you that day  That was you  That was me  Okay  Because he knew my brother  From working at the Bone  Yeah yeah  My brother used to go in there  And do stuff for that show  And then  Yeah he came up to me  And said he hung out  With my brother  Over there  And wants to intern  And I was like  Yeah give me your info  And of course  I passed it on  To my garbage pail  Yeah I probably went home  I was like  You had a great conversation  With Open Ant today  Oh I know  Things are looking real good  Yeah I think this is really  Going to work out  They really seemed like  They wanted somebody 
[02:00:30]  Yeah sure  Talk to Ben  On the work  Yeah let me just  You know something  It's good for me  To probably say this now  Anything you give me  At a live appearance  That we do  Don't ruin it  Don't ruin it  Unless it's fucking  Gold doubloons  I am throwing away  I don't care if I look  And go  I'll look you right in the face  And go  Oh no I know what I've said  But this I'll give a listen to  Or this I'll look at  Or I will call  I will not  Whatever you give me 
[02:01:00]  Will not leave the building  With me  Band CDs are the worst  No offense to all you guys  Trying to make it out there  They're the worst  Sorry  Could you please listen to my band  I don't have time to listen to  You know my favorite bands  At this point  I got hundreds of XM channels  I don't listen to  That I could be sifting through  Godsmack didn't have a chance  With us  That pretty much  Should say a lot to you  If you're a band  Giving us a CD  And I don't mean anything bad by it  I just don't have time  I threw Godsmack CD away  Yeah  Sully personally gave me 
[02:01:30]  Yep  The CD that was going to become  The first Godsmack record  Which was beyond huge  And now they're  Like one of the biggest  Rock bands in the world  Dude check this out  It's my band  It was  We did  Yeah sure  We did an appearance  At one of these music centers  With Sully  He was doing a drum demonstration  We all hung out  We had a great time  And he's like  Here's my latest project  I'm working on  You know why don't you guys  Give it a listen  He was giving the CD  To everybody  All over Boston  On the way home  I threw it into  One of the rivers  Yep  I think it's the Connecticut River  Officially I don't know 
[02:02:00]  Or maybe the Charles River  Whatever  Whatever  I was going over a bridge  Jay was in the car  Our old pal Jay  I go Jay  Open the window  And I threw his CD  Into the river  Because it used to make us laugh  Kind of  You know  When we'd get a stack of these  And we'd actually bring it out  To our car  When we're all driving back  To our homes  Or whatever it is  If we're all in the same vehicle  We'd just laugh at how  This poor son of a bitch  Probably put his work  And effort  And really gave it to us  With the intention of us  Listening  And has these fantasies 
[02:02:30]  Of us playing it on the air  Or something  And it's just getting  Thrown out the window  It's horrible  It really is horrible  And cruel  Yeah we understand that  I did it just to make  Jay and you laugh  Yeah make us laugh  Because Jay would get  So uncomfortable  Like you're not going  You're not  You're not  What will it take  To just listen to it  For a second  Open the window  And I was like  Fake throwing it at first  Pulling it back  And then it just goes  Whee  And let it be known  You know  I'm a huge Godsmack fan  Sully ended up 
[02:03:00]  Becoming friends  With the show  And I missed my opportunity  I could have been  I could have been  The guy instead of Rocco  Right that broke it  But yeah it was Rocco  Because Rocco  Didn't ever have shit  For his show  So anything that would  Fill two minutes  Like a Godsmack song  I could have been the guy  Yeah I broke this record dude  But it was basically gold  It was like  It was like  Kurt Cobain  Because I'm sure  He did the same thing  It's like Kurt Cobain  Handing over his demo tape  To a local DJ  And that DJ  Throwing it  Into the river 
[02:03:30]  Just throwing it  Without listening  I bet this is going to suck  Right  Not even giving it a try  So whatever  Horrible  Well I hope you  Had the same enjoyment  Throwing away my  Homemade business card  I had made on a computer  Oh  I'm sorry Nathaniel  Copied the little bone logo  Off the website  I'm so happy  Well you know I have  The utmost confidence  And respect in you now  Well I appreciate it  You've earned it sir  So my stalking didn't work 
[02:04:00]  Fine  No the stalking didn't work  Hard work and perseverance  That worked  We've all learned a lesson  Here today  Sure  You know Ricky himself  I hear somebody saying  Ricky was the first caller  We had on the air  Oh really  Is that true  Some guy  He was here for  And he was in the  Cherry dart  I remember that  So obviously  Hey you're back  Hi  What did the guys  Have you doing  I had to go to  Comp USA to look for  Some cable for Mars  Some cable  Yes  And did you get the cable  No I didn't have to get it 
[02:04:30]  I just had to see  If it was available or not  Oh  Why didn't you  I thought you had to get it  No no no  He's going to get it later  Oh they didn't trust you  To get it  No  No  It was a Cat 5 cable  Yeah  And you found one  Yeah  I had to find one  The length of 250 feet  Ricky A wants to talk to you today  Sure  Ricky brought your wacky horn  Is that true too  Yeah I bought it the second week  That looking is right there  Thank you Ricky  Yeah no problem  Ricky we hear  We hear you're  You're having a few problems 
[02:05:00]  With school  Maybe at home  And it involves  Time spent here  Doing your internship  Maybe a little more time  Spent here  Than should be spent here  And maybe more time  Should be spent  Doing other things  Is that what I'm hearing  What do you mean  Like  I don't know  It sounds like  You're shirking  Some of your school  Responsibilities  Like your grades  Are slipping  Because you're spending  Time here  Oh no  Grades have always  Been slipping  I just 
[02:05:30]  No I've always  Sucked in school  Yeah  My grades have always  Been slipping  Yeah I'll admit that  I've sucked in school  Yeah  And I heard something else  About the reason  You got the taco job  Is that you were coming here  For your internship  And your mom  Yeah  And I said that  If you come back  Without a job  You're gone  Yeah  There was basically  We had the two weeks off  Vacation or whatever  And it was going to be spent  Like doing nothing  But then Poe wanted help 
[02:06:00]  And you know  I told my parents  Okay maybe I don't have  Two weeks off  I was going to come  And help Poe  He's security or whatever  And my mom flipped on me  She was like  Oh you know  Don't go  You know  You're coming here  For the radio  You're learning about radio  Not Poe  You're not going to help  This guy  He's security  She sounds very wise  So she was like  You know  And you know  If you don't find a job  Because you know  That's what you should be  Doing in the two weeks  Then  And if you go down  To the station  And help this guy  Then you're not going to  Be living here anymore  Wow  Well I just kind of  Want to know  What goal do you have 
[02:06:30]  What do you want to do  Oh Poe is not happy  Poe just walked  Right into the studio  Poe hasn't done this  In quite a long time  Yes Master Poe  Poe you're looking  Exceptionally badass today  I must say  You're wearing green camo  Pants  And a black shirt  With some kind of  I'll kick your ass seal  Over the heart  Thank you  That's nice  Very intimidating  Ben just told me  That you threw me  Under the bus  Yeah no  Remember I told you  During the two weeks off  My mom wouldn't let me help you  Yes 
[02:07:00]  Yeah that's what  I was just talking about  Oh yeah  Yeah mommy  Wouldn't let you help me  Yeah  Yeah  No no I understand  So I had to do it all  By myself  Yeah I apologize for that though  No that's okay  I understand  But next time  You'll help me out right  Yeah of course  Alright  Because I was talking  To the guys  Who were probably  Going to come back here  At four o'clock in the morning  And do some work  You ready for it  Why not  Alright  Little Ricky of Cobra Kai 
[02:07:30]  No guys  I have to tell you  When he does help me  He works very hard  Right  He really does  Oh yeah  Yeah  That's what we hear  Alright thank you  Thank you  So Ricky  What is it  That you're looking  To do  With your life  What is your  You must have a goal  An end game somewhere  What do you want to do  Hopefully radio  Hopefully radio  You want to be  That's terrific 
[02:08:00]  That's terrific  God damn it  Are you fucking with me  Stupid  You're so stupid  Okay terrific  Anyway  Oh yeah  You are insane  Whatever  Who cares  Well now  You want to  You want to be on air  Yeah  Is that it  Being on air 
[02:08:30]  Yeah  If that  Personality  You want to do  Like talk  Or spin records  Talk or spin records  Whatever both  It doesn't matter  Just to kind of  Be on the air  And you feel  That this internship  Is a good way  To get your foot  In the door  Yeah  As far  And that's why  You're spending  So much time  Here doing this  Alright  How do you think  It's going Ricky  Not so well  I'll be honest  Not so well  Yeah  What do you think  If you can make  That assessment  You must base it  On something 
[02:09:00]  What do you believe  Is not going so well  Well I don't get  Food orders right  First thing  Well  But as far as  Now I'll be  I'll be open  And honest here  As far as  Having a career  In radio  An intern  Getting a food order  Right or wrong  Really doesn't have  Much to do with it  I'm sure  Young Opie  A young go-getter  Probably screwed up  A couple of food orders  Or really didn't want  To get food  Or you know  Something like that  But his goal  Was to be on the air  No 
[02:09:30]  No  Not even once  You never screwed up  No not really  Not when it came  To getting someone food  Getting someone food  No  It really isn't  That tough a job  Is it  Come on dude  Most places  You order by a number  Now  That's true  Anthony needs a number  Three  Yeah  I don't even ask him  To get me food  No  I'm just thinking  If you have to  Screw something up  That's pretty much it  Is the food thing  And because it really  Doesn't have anything  To do with radio  And what you're learning  You know  As far as  What you're going to 
[02:10:00]  Need to know  In radio  It's pretty much  Things you pick up  Just being around  The vibe of a show  You know  And how do you think  That's going  You mean like  Picking up on all  These things  Noticing all the  Production  How the show runs  Interacting with the  Guys in the glass  Booth over there  That you know  The unseen heroes  That keep the  Opie and Anthony  Show going  Things like that  Are you learning  From them  Yeah of course  I mean I've learned  I've seen how they  Work behind the scenes  They're busting their 
[02:10:30]  Asses  Do you feel  You'd be able  If one of them  Were out one day  To slip in  And do their job  I would hope  Do you feel  Comfortable here  Yeah  I don't know Ricky  I don't know  If radio  Is really for you 
[02:11:00]  I just don't know  It's one of those  Things  I don't know  I've heard your tape  And again  It's not  You can't make  A decision  Based on one  Air check  And perhaps  You'll grow  As an air  Personality  But based on  That  Your delivery  Of something  I believe  To be successful  In radio  Aside from  Just learning stuff  You need  Some type of  Natural spark  Yeah  Something in 
[02:11:30]  Your personality  That regardless  Of everything  You can learn  You need  Something that  Is almost  In you for life  You know  Like a sense  Of humor  Maybe  Some insight  Maybe a radio  Voice  A radio voice  Too  Yeah  You could have  Nothing upstairs  And if you have  That radio voice  To intro records  That's all you need  Read the liners  Things like that  What do you see  As maybe a talent  Some kind of  Natural talent  That you can't  Teach somebody 
[02:12:00]  That you have  That would put you  Ahead of others  In radio  Honestly  I really don't  See anything  Did you see  That jerk  He sees  Nothing  You don't  You see  Nothing in  Yourself  Yeah  I'm a very  Negative person  You're a very  Negative person  You better not  Be negative  Around Opie  Get the negative 
[02:12:30]  Out of his life  You'll be the  First one to go  Really  Wow  Because I'm  Thinking  Ricky do you  Have a plan B  Is there a plan B  For you  Just in case  Any of this  Doesn't work out  Do you have  Do you know  A trade  A trade skill  Perhaps a  Plumber's assistant  I really don't  Have a plan B  To be honest  No no plan B  Radio or  Nothing  A warm bath  And some razor blades  Because I don't 
[02:13:00]  Know I'm just  Not seeing it  Gelling with you  Yeah  I see it  There's this  Kind of  Come on man  It's his dream  Stop  Just see  I understand  His dream  I see a  Complete lack  Of confidence  On your part  You're not a  Very confident  Person in yourself  Well Derek  From Alabama  Is saying that  Ricky has a  Voice for NPR  Radio  Well  Maybe you can  Do some NPR  Stuff  There you go  Do you think  You'd be able  To maybe  Give the issues 
[02:13:30]  A spin  Based on  Your own  Take on it  I guess I can  Yeah  Might have to  Have him do that  Maybe that's  His thing  Well he  He's good  At improvising  I remember  When Bruce Kelly  Was doing those  Interviews  While we were  On vacation  They were asking  All the people  That are associated  With us  To give some  Words on us  And we heard  How horrible  Every one of those  Were  Yeah  Frenchie  The chef  Telling his  Hours  That he wakes  Up and goes  To work 
[02:14:00]  That's how bad  And they  Decided  That yours  Weren't good  Enough to make  That cut  There was a  Moment where  It's like  Alright  Here's the  Time to shine  I can improv  Something a little  I'm going to  Show these guys  That I got  A little something  I got to defend  Bruce Kelly now  Wow  Really  I really do  He didn't have  Much to work with  Because he  We ended up  Playing the ones  That he thought  Were good  There were a  Whole bunch of  Interviews he did  With some of the  People that just  Never made the cut  One  Was with Ricky  Was with Ricky  Which I think  We should play  Right now 
[02:14:30]  You want to  Listen in on this  Let's give a little  Listen to the one  That didn't make it  Alright  Maybe Ricky  Can tell us  What went wrong  With this  Ricky is one of the  Behind the scene  Members of the  ONA virus  On XM202  High voltage  Ricky what's your job  I intern for the  Opie and Anthony show  I basically  Do the things  Behind the scenes  I get them food  I get them coffee  I also do some  Paperwork with  Master Poe  And I also  Get feedback  For the guys  What's the weirdest  Thing you've had  To do for ONA 
[02:15:00]  Oh  Weirdest  Nothing particularly  Weird at all  I mean the only  Thing they did  Was do a run around  On me  Which was you know  They told me to  Get food over  And over and over  Again  But like one of  The foods  Oh  The nervous gulp  Like they would  Say that I screwed  Up the order  Somehow  Like I got them  A bagel with  Cream cheese  And he goes  And I give it to  Jim  And Jim's like  No see  This is toasted  Nobody likes  A toasted bagel  So then he tosses  It to the side  And then he's like  You know  Give me a regular  Bagel  But from a certain 
[02:15:30]  Deli  So I had to go  Two blocks  Like down  Away from like  The station  And try to get  The bagel  And keep going  Over and over  And over  For coffee  For bagels  For over and over  And again  How did you become  A member of the  ONA virus  I just gave my  Resume in to  Ben  Ben Sparks  The executive producer  Ben Sparks  The executive producer  Ben Sparks  Ben Sparks  Executive producer  See  That was 
[02:16:00]  Ben must have  Been tired  I gotta be honest  With you man  Ben does a great job  But I think that  When you had it  In your resume  Ben must have  Been tired  Well  I don't know  Let's be honest  I think he was  Just like  Yeah  Alright  Eeny  Meeny  Miney  Moe  I think  Those are the words  That started the selection  Ben was on a bender  Or something  And said  Ah  Yeah  What the hell  I didn't want to say  The actual story  How I got his car  Or whatever  But like  Mainly  Is it as exciting  As the bagel story 
[02:16:30]  You told  No I just helped out  During the Howard Stern rally  That was all  Yeah  With huge signs  I was with Megan  Along the line  With uh  When Howard was leaving  At the limo  I was right there  With Megan  With a huge sign  Running in his face  Right  And at the Letterman show  With a few other guys  As well from Whack Bag  Yes Ben  Well Ricky  You know  Look at him  He's like  He's not all there  But he's a good kid  At the end of the day  He tries  You know  He did a great job  The day of the Howard  From the executive producer  No I like Ricky  That's a great review  He's not all there 
[02:17:00]  But he tries  He does  So I mean  At the end of the day  Ricky tries  And he's done a good job  At the end of the day  Ricky tries  That's something you say  To the guy that comes in third  In the Special Olympics  Well yeah  At the end of the day  Ricky does try  How long did it take you  To find the advertising  The full page ad  For Opie and Anthony  The other day  That took me  The last hour  All the way to 12  The last hour of the show  Yeah  So from 10 a.m. to 12  To 12  Two hours  You were looking through newspapers 
[02:17:30]  To find the full page  Opie and Anthony ad  Yeah  That Ben told you to look for  Yeah  Who thinks you're a good guy  He's a good guy  Boy Ben  You're just a great guy yourself  At the end of the day  At the end of the day  Yeah  It took you two hours  Going through newspapers  To find one full page ad  I ended up not finding it anyway  And the other guys  Just tell me  Just forget about it  You know  So you didn't find it anyway  After two hours  Yeah  But he tried Ben  He tries  He tries  That's good  Anywhere along the two hours  Did you think that  Maybe someone was fucking with you  Yeah 
[02:18:00]  But then I said  Well maybe they're not  But might as well  Keep doing it anyway  Wouldn't you  At some point  Maybe go up and go  Guys  Are you fucking with me  I mainly don't do it  If it is  Or if you're  Inimitable style  Guys  Are you fucking with me  Don't  Guys don't fuck  All right  You need a little more  Gumption  That's the only word  I could come up with  I don't know 
[02:18:30]  Well you know  You can stay  With the show  As long as you want  You know  You're welcome to  You know  We'll buy you lunch  Every once in a while  That'll be cool  Kick around  Sure  Yeah we're not going to  Kick you out the door  But as far as  Making this  A career with us  Yeah  Do you think  Is there  A goal  Where  Like some of the people here  Perhaps  You'll be taken on board  And be a paid employee  Of the Opie and Anthony show 
[02:19:00]  I don't foresee that  To be honest with you  You don't  Yeah  Dude you gotta be  I know this is a bit  But you gotta be more  Positive with yourself  A little more  Just a little more  I can't do this  To the kids  You gotta be positive  Though dude  You can't say that  You never know  Nathaniel yes  Well I have one concern  With Ricky  Which is  There's a lot of sarcasm  On this show  And I was concerned  Because  The other day  I was  They were moving  Some stuff around  The office  And I was  Sitting at Steve's  Computer doing some stuff  And I was surrounded  By chairs  And I said 
[02:19:30]  Can I get one more  Chair around me  Please  And Ricky  Honestly  Goes over to the couch  Stop it  And starts pushing  The couch  Towards me  Oh my god  You're kidding  With no sense  Of irony at all  Ricky  When are you in here next  Ricky  I'm in here  Wednesday  That is the funniest  God damn thing  I've ever heard  Can I get one more  Chair  You didn't see 
[02:20:00]  The sarcasm there  No  I just heard  I just heard  The statement  I said  Alright  Oh my god  Alright  Ricky  You're going to be  Back Wednesday  Yeah  Alright  I think  Technically  We're his bosses  For this internship  I think at the end  Of the internship  We actually have to  Write a review  A little review  We're going to give you  A little assignment  We want you to  Do a slight  A small presentation  On sarcasm  For Wednesday's show  You mean a verbal  Presentation  Or  Yeah 
[02:20:30]  Verbal  No use hand puppets  To explore your feelings  On sarcasm  It's radio  Of course  Now Nathaniel's going  Watch  He's going to come in  Now with hand puppets  You got the next  He doesn't understand  You got the next two days  To come up with a  Relatively short presentation  On sarcasm  How short  That you can present  To Anthony and I  Live on the show  Okay  Alright  How short  Just  You know  What is sarcasm  Maybe some examples  Of sarcasm 
[02:21:00]  Things like that  How long  Would you say  This should be  You know  Like a five minute presentation  Five minute presentation  Okay  Alright  Now the thing you did  With the asshole  For the  Bruce  Bruce Kelly  Oh Bruce  I'm sorry  Yeah  You did for him  Didn't you  Why are you calling him  An asshole  I don't know  Pain in the ass then  Not asshole  Pain in the ass  Because he has a pain  In the ass  The thing you did  With him  Did you  Did you know  When it was going on  That it was  Really dull  Yeah  Now when he asked you 
[02:21:30]  What's the  You know  The strangest thing you did  You should have said  Well  You know  Didn't it come to mind  Maybe think of  Before I was an intern  I came in  With cherry darts  And you could describe  Cherry darts  And how crazy that was  And stuff  Didn't you think  That might have made  A better story  Than going out  To get a bagel  And getting lost  I didn't think of it  At the time  No  Yeah  Well that's the whole thing  Of spontaneity  Yeah  Thinking on your feet  Like that  And it's part of  Part of radio  You want to go back  To the Bruce Kelly thing  A couple more minutes here  Oh there was more  Oh yeah  Hit that  Why did you become 
[02:22:00]  A member of the ONA virus  Just to be part of the show  I mean you know  It's also for college credit  I'm getting credit for this as well  But you know  It's also for the fun  I mean I'm a fan of this show  I love this show  And you know  It's been fun so far  First thing that comes to your mind  When I say  Opie and Anthony  Talk  Go  Amazing  They're phenomenal  Like  You can't get any better  Than them  Than that now  Like there's a lot of other shows  Out there  But nothing can match  Opie and Anthony  For now  For now  What's the difference  Between ONA on 
[02:22:30]  What do you mean for now  Well  Until Ricky gets on the air  No  You understand  There's never going to be  Anyone better than us  No I mean  Until like the show  Actually like ends  And goes off the air  And you know  Right  Then we won't be  The best show on the air  Because we'll be  Off the air  Yeah  Off the air  Very good  You can't get any better  Than them  Than that now  Like there's a lot of  Other shows  I don't think  Can actually be an Anthony  For now 
[02:23:00]  Wasn't a nervous laugh  Stinky FM  And ONA  Now on XM  High voltage 202  The freedom  The freedom to curse  I mean  They don't curse as much  But they still have more freedom  To say more things  And more open to say more things  In verse 2  When they were on the other station  When they had to  Hull back a lot of things  And  You know  Just find code words  For certain  Like  Orifices of the body  Or  You know  Try to  Try to  Like make up words  Like I said  To  Try to disguise 
[02:23:30]  What they actually want to say  Whether it be a curse word  Or  Something graphic  On  Whatever's happening  You are Ned nervous  Who can be the biggest asshole  When they're mad  O  Or A  Or Jimmy  Wow  I haven't seen the words  Of all of them  But I think  I'd probably say Opie  But I wasn't there  For his anger  When I  You motherfucker  This kid  Thank you  That's good acting  Right  Yeah  I had got the milk  At Dwayne Reed  And it took a while  And he flipped  And I had to go to leave  Because I had messed up 
[02:24:00]  On Steve's orders too  Which I got him  Two regular Mountain Dews  Instead of two diet Mountain Dews  So  He was flipping  And I was gone  So I didn't get to see  His fury  In person  There's a lot of members  Of the XM Nation  Who have not heard  Opie and Anthony  Now that they're free  On channel 202  It's up to you  To sell O and A  To those  Members of the XM Nation  Go  Go  You're talking to people  Who've never heard them  Or have never heard of them  Talk to them 
[02:24:30]  I don't know  I had to  Oh  Oh  Oh  And then he played it  So don't worry  You're going to sound brilliant  No matter what you say  Yeah I mean  Trying to get a degree  In communication  Is kind of rough  You know  It's okay  It's alright man  Chill  Yeah  Remember  You're going to sell them to me  Sell them to me  Look at me right now  And sell Opie and Anthony  I've never heard of them  Who are these guys  Opie and Anthony  Are based in New York  They're out of  They just came out of  Infinity Broadcasting

[02:25:30]  In partake  Because I don't really  Listen to the other channels  In XM  I either just listen to  Opie and Anthony  Or just try to do my homework  Or whatever  But particularly the hip hop stations  Maybe the techno stations  And that's about it  Oh and the comedy channel  150  I like that too  Yeah  Wow  That was really painful  Yeah  Well any fucking time  Sweetheart  That's what he should have said  Wow  That was like  Pulling teeth  That was brutal 
[02:26:00]  Just sell me on the show  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  Wow  You got all tied up there  Yeah  Alright well Wednesday  You come in with a little report  On sarcasm  Okay  Okay  Because we do a lot of that  On this program  I'm not sure if you know that yet  But  Yeah  So you really need to learn  About sarcasm  Okay  And we'll learn all about that  On Wednesday  Yeah  Little report  Alright  Alright  If you don't have it  You gotta go home  Okay  Cool  Not a threat  But I mean you know 
[02:26:30]  People are gonna be counting  On your  On your little report  About sarcasm  Okay  Right  Alright  Alright there he goes  Ricky  Our  Our intern  Thank you Ricky  Remember  Plan B  Plan B  Anthony we gotta take a break  Plan B  Okay  We got something very interesting  That's about to happen  Matt Hardy  Who used to be  A wrestler with the WWE  Yep  Personally emailed me  Because he heard what  Chris Jericho said on our show  Yeah  Matt Hardy had all sorts of  Problems happen to him  While he was rehabbing an injury 
[02:27:00]  I wanna hear Matt's side  And Chris Jericho  Pretty much said  It was pretty much  I don't wanna quote him  But he said that  It's just wrong  What the WWE did to Matt Hardy  Said it was bad for business  Bad for business  But basically  What happened there  Eric  Cause even if you're not  A wrestling fan  This is gonna be  Very interesting radio  Because I think  There's a bunch of people  Out there that can relate to this  Go ahead  Well he was dating  A female wrestler named Lita  Of the WWE  And another wrestler  Edge  Who I'm assuming  Is still married  Wound up having  Relations with Lita 
[02:27:30]  And she was still  Going out with Matt  At the time  But he was out  On an injury  And Matt and Edge  Were friends right  Yeah  So he's back home  Nursing this injury  Trying to get back  Into the wrestling game  And in the meantime  His chick who's on the road  Because she works  For the company  Is now  What I heard  Allegedly banging  Your friend  Jesus Christ  And to make matters worse  They delayed his return  And then released him  From the company  So he's not even  Working there anymore 
[02:28:00]  So we're gonna get  His side of the story  In a few minutes  How do you do that  Like what's the speculation  On that one  And then on Raw  Monday night  Lita was in the ring  And she had like  20,000 people  Basically chanting  You screwed Matt  And we want Matt  And she was supposed  To be the good guy  In this little interview  Shoot that they were doing  And people were just  Trashing her  Yelling signs  Everything  Cool  Right at MSG  Here in New York  And that's one reason  Why I like Chris Jericho  So much  Because you know  You know  He came right out 
[02:28:30]  And said it's  Bad business  Yeah  Pretty odd  He's got a career  Yeah  Pretty honest stuff  From him though  You know  Yep  So we're gonna take a break  Tell Matt  Matt's on hold right now  We're gonna talk to him next  See what this is all about  Alright  But in the meantime  Check out this  On this day  Prescribed by law  And marked by ceremony  We are led  To one conclusion  This place  Just blows  You're being harsh  Let's listen in  On a show prep meeting 
[02:29:00]  In the Opie and Anthony laboratory  Hey guys  Anyone want a bagel?  No!  Stop ruining the show  Eric  The Opie and Anthony show  Feel the love  Hey we're back with the Opie and Anthony program 
[02:29:30]  I thought it would be a good idea to play Matt Hardy's theme music  Gotta waste my whole day  Sort of worked I guess  Hard to talk over 
[02:30:00]  Yeah  Let's say hi to Matt Hardy  Hey Matt  Yes sir  What's up man?  How are you guys?  How are you buddy?  Very good  I was very surprised to get an email from you  I gotta tell you  Yeah you know  It's quite a big story these days  A lot of people were talking about it  And you know Chris was on your guy's show  And it was addressed  And I was very happy that Chris stuck up for me so to say  And I just wanted to buzz you on it  No worries  I gotta start by saying  You know the Hardy Boys 
[02:30:30]  When I was watching wrestling  You know on a regular basis  I mean you guys were  Right up there as far as my favorites go  Thanks man  Yeah I mean we  We made tag team wrestling cool again back in the day  Yep  The ladder matches and all  That stuff is just insane  Yeah I mean you know  Both Jeff and I  We gave the WWE everything inside our body  You know night in and night out  Now let's get right into it  Why did they let you go?  Well as you just kind of said the situation before  I found out that my girlfriend of five or six years 
[02:31:00]  Had become involved in a relationship  Which was the agenda of Adam Copeland  Which is Edge  Obviously he had some sort of agenda going into this thing  And I found out something had happened  And Amy who was leading  Knew she got herself into a situation  That she really shouldn't have  And she was kind of trying to back out  And this guy was putting the pressure on her  And there was actually  The weekend I found out about her  She had gone the whole weekend and not spoke to her  And he had just piled up messages on her phone  Just real pitiful messages  Just you know I love you  I love you  If you're going to be with Matt and not with me 
[02:31:30]  Then I don't have a reason to be here  And just absurd stuff  Wow really?  Yeah just like psychotic level stuff  Wait so we're talking about Edge and Lita?  Yes  Alright and is Edge  And Edge you know who was leaving these messages  Once she was kind of trying to get her head right  At the end you know is a guy who's married  Who has a wife at home  And his second wife  Alright so Edge has a wife at home  You were seeing Lita for five or six years?  Yeah we'd been seeing each other serious  We'd known each other for six years 
[02:32:00]  We'd probably been serious for four to four and a half years  Alright and then behind your back she starts fooling around with Edge?  Yeah there's Edge has an agenda  She was by herself on the road  He asked oh can I ride with you  You know I'll take care of you  Alright wait we've got to slow down here  So okay Lita's on the road  Yeah  And so  I'm actually out  I'm out injured at this point  I had a  You know my left knee  I had complete reconstructive surgery on my left knee  Just from years of wear and tear  Just being a wrestler  Being with the WWE  So it's got to be tough to begin with to be a female wrestler on the road 
[02:32:30]  You know  Sure  Now she's on the road and she's traveling by herself because we always travel together  Right  And there came a point up where this guy had been one of my closest friends for so many years  And it's like I would have trusted him with my life  Wow  And then when she was going to ride with him I was going well that's cool  Because you know now she'll be fine because there's a guy with her  Alright okay so you're at home and thinking okay now Edge is going to you know travel with Lita  That's exactly something I would want because I know both people very well right  Yeah  Just like the same thing if I traveled with his wife it would never go through my mind 
[02:33:00]  Because that's the kind of relationship we had  Right  It's like a brother type relationship  Guys don't do that to each other right  No man that's the biggest taboo in any business  Exactly  So then all of a sudden you're starting to get an idea that maybe she's fooling around on you  Well I just actually his wife contacted me and said there were some weird text messages  Oh boy  And then I'd ask about it nothing was going on  And like I said she obviously knew that she had got herself into a situation she couldn't get out of 
[02:33:30]  And I think she was regretful I don't think Edge was  You know that's the big thing there  And then once I discovered these messages from Edge that he'd called and left her all during the weekend  He'd called and left five or six messages like a psycho  And you know I questioned her about it she was asked to leave the house at that point  And then you know him I spoke to him actually after that like you know  You know what in the hell are you thinking man  You know like what a piece of shit  You know why would you do this  And he's like oh buddy you know I'm sorry 
[02:34:00]  You know I messed up you know you guys can still work things out  Da da da da da  And then he would get off the phone right after that  And I know he'd call her and say yeah I know that was bad but he's gone now we can be together  We can be together  Jesus Christ  Are you kidding me  No I mean this is the kind of guy we're dealing with here  So they fooled around how many times you think  Was it an ongoing thing or  It was a pretty brief thing  Alright so it was a brief thing  She's lonely on the road and then unfortunately it happened  But then she realized she made a mistake  Yeah definitely 
[02:34:30]  But you know by this point it was obviously too late  You know because all this stuff is going on  And then I'm making my return  I'm rehabbing  I've been busting my ass for six months  To get back to the company  To the WWE  The company I love  The company I've given everything for  And you know I have a couple of appearances here and there  Then these appearances start  You know that they get cancelled  And the reason why is they're worried  Because of a physical confrontation  Obviously between me and Edge  You know because obviously this guy wants to do anything he can  Not to face me  And he still does  And he's still married and now he wants Lita 
[02:35:00]  Yeah yeah yeah  But how does Edge have that kind of pull  In the company  That if they don't want some kind of  Problems between you two  To get you out of the picture  Well I don't know  Well that's the thing  I don't know if he really does have that pull  But it's just like he was on TV  You know he was in the midst of  Having a lot done with him  You know he was in the midst of a push  And she's been on TV as well  I'm just the odd man out  Because I've been sitting at home for six months  Right  You know so then  Once the story starts breaking 
[02:35:30]  And another thing maybe  You know I was so outraged  When I heard all this  Maybe I didn't handle everything perfectly right  Because you know once people  Start talking about this story  I went ahead and defended myself  You know I went ahead and let people know  Like this was the situation  And you know  It's a fucked up situation  All the way around  You know but I'm not the bad guy  And this is what happened  You know and I'm not ashamed of doing that  Because I wasn't going to like the bad guy  Right  In such a terrible situation  Alright so you don't want to get back  With Lita at all  Right now  I speak with her on a social level 
[02:36:00]  And that's pretty much where it is  And you're really pissed off  That she cheated on you obviously  And what would you do to Edge if you saw him  I probably shouldn't say that on the air  So you're still beyond angry  And he was one of your better friends  In the company right  Beyond anger  And then you know just with the WWE  You know it came to a point where  It was just I think just like Chris said  It was real bad business  Because I'm the guy that was the odd man out  I was sitting at home  And the easy way to get out of the situation 
[02:36:30]  Without having a confrontation  Was to release me and let my deal run out  Can you imagine Anthony  I mean you leave the company  Because you got an injury  You got your chick  That's still in the company  Still in the company  And you're at home just rehabbing  And you have nothing to do with it  She ends up cheating on you  And now the company releases you  Because that's the easy way to do it  Insult to injury man  Literally  And it's just brutal on so many levels  And you know if they were upset with me  Addressing the situation  Or if they were worried about a physical confrontation 
[02:37:00]  If they would have set the three of us down  And  Well what do you mean by address the situation  What did you say about this publicly  I mean I just clear up the situation  I just said well this is what's happened  Once words started  I mean dude we're you know we're celebrities  We're in the you know we're in the public eye  And this situation was going to get out anyway  You know what I'm saying  As far as like on the internet and what not  And when this situation was addressed  Well this is you know  There was never a problem between Lita and I at all  Zero problems the whole time during a relationship  So people didn't turn into a situation like 
[02:37:30]  Oh well Matt was abusive towards her  Or Matt was this or Matt was that  No there was no problems at all  Right  That's what I'm saying you understand  Yeah I do understand that  You know I didn't want that to come out  Well you know if the situation comes out  And they say well Lita and Edge are together  And then people say why is that  You know did Matt beat her  What's he mean to her  Was this blah blah blah  Well because it was well known  You were seeing her obviously  So it wasn't one  It wasn't a private thing  We were like a  We were a poster couple of the WWE  Because we'd been together so long  Right right  You know she  Our relationship was great 
[02:38:00]  Because like I said  From day one there had been zero problems  Less than zero  So it seems obvious to me  That you pretty much threatened Edge  Over this whole situation  And Vince you know  Decided this is how he's going to handle it  Because he doesn't want any confrontations I guess  Right  Well I guess too  Also there was  But who would blame you  I mean every guy out there  Is probably nodding at the radio  Going of course I'm going to  You know defend myself  In a situation like this  Absolutely  I mean you can even look at  I mean look at the locker room  Just like  Jericho's on your show 
[02:38:30]  There's a ton of guys  Who just think  This is absolutely horrible  I mean just even  For running a locker room  What does that say  To the rest of your locker room  If this situation happens  To one of your most  Loyal employees  Is sitting at home hurt  And there's a situation  Where his girlfriend  And one of his better friends  Get involved in a relationship  And this guy  Instead again  To come back to work  Ends up getting released  Make it paranoid  You know  And two  There was a couple other things  Like  There was one time  Edge was here in Fedville  And then on the way  To Columbia, South Carolina  I think it happened in Columbia  I'm not exactly sure 
[02:39:00]  What happened  His tires were slashed  On his rental car  And for some reason  I got the blame for that  Although I was  You know  I was 200 miles away  At home  You know  And I don't know  If that were  You know  We're fans  Or you know  Whoever it was  I mean there's a lot of people  That hate this guy  Especially coming off this situation  Like you said before  That's just like  Something that guys  Do not do  I mean that  Yeah  You're breaking the guy code man  I mean that's crazy  Yep  You know  One of your best friends  Banging your chick  That just  Should never happen  You know 
[02:39:30]  I mean  And this guy too  Once again  Like  You know  I spoke to his wife a lot  He was just terribly  Just so  Mentally abusive to his wife  It was just brutal too  I mean she's a real sweet girl too  And he just put her through the ringer  And like I said  He's 30 years old  This is the second time  He's been married  Getting ready to be over  I mean just  That pretty much says right there  What the quality of this guy is  So you think he's separated from his wife right now  They're in the process of getting a divorce  I would say right now  And he still wants Lita  He's still working that angle  I'm sure he is  I'm sure he's still trying to work it 
[02:40:00]  You know I think she's caught on to his game by this point  But yeah he's definitely still trying to work it  Dude did you completely blow up at her  Because that's like  Yeah  I mean how can you not  I mean  Of course  I've been the most  Driving force in her career anyway  Like when she started  It was with myself and my brother  Jeff Hardy  And you know  Pretty much everything she'd learned  From starting in the WWE  Coming through  Was through me  You know  Well you guys  It's obvious  That's when I was watching a lot  You guys brought her up  Into the whole business  And made her what she is today  So  And you know I mean 
[02:40:30]  It was very like  Once again you said  This whole situation  Which is a real bullshit situation  Like when you watch  You know Raw from MSG  I mean they  You know  People in New York  They're the barometer  Of what wrestling is all about  Especially in the WWE  Yeah  And when you sit there  And you watch 20,000 people  Chant  You know  You screwed Matt  And we want Matt  I mean that's a message  That says something  That says what those people believe  And Vince hasn't said anything to you?  No  I mean I haven't been  Since I was notified of my release  I hadn't heard of anything  From the company right now 
[02:41:00]  They haven't even contacted you  And what was the excuse for the release?  They had to give you something, no?  It was  It was  Not very much  We're going to look at some other guys  Jeez  And do you think you could wrestle  You think you could wrestle  Like you were wrestling in the WWE?  Oh even better than that  So they can't use the excuse  That you're  You're  You're  You're  You're  You're a weaker product  No I mean  Right now  I'm  Healthier than I've ever been  I'm in the best shape I've ever been  I actually  I have more to offer  To the wrestling business right now 
[02:41:30]  Than I ever have before  And you know  That we also have two branches  We have Raw and Smackdown  And if I would have went to Smackdown  And you know  Lita and Edge would have been on Raw  There'd never been a problem one  Yeah it's like two separate camps right?  Yeah you know  You don't even bump into each other  A couple times  Yeah but it sounds like  Vince is really really scared  That there's going to be  Some crazy physical confrontation  I say let it happen  Yeah right  Bring it on  Put that in the goddamn ring  Yeah screw the  Quote fake stuff  Get a cage match  With you two in it  With you two  Kicking each other's ass 
[02:42:00]  In a UFC match  Oh my god  Pay per view  Ultimate fighting  I will tell you this too  Like I even got to the point  Where right before  I was notified  Of my release  That I'd kind of come  Especially the first  Two or three weeks man  As you can imagine  I was  It was like temporary insanity  You know like  No shit  I was just a maniac  You don't have to tell Anthony  About that stuff  I guess you guys know  Temporary insanity good  Yeah  But anyway man  I got to the point  Where I'd cool down  Like I said  I could be on a social level  With Lita 
[02:42:30]  Even though I wasn't appreciative  Any of what she did obviously  Of course  But I would have got to a point  Where I could have went  Smackdown  And I would have avoided  All conflict with him  And just went ahead about  You know daily life  As it were  And be professional  Do your job  And then you know  Be pissed off when you're done  Yep  Unfortunately  Instead of sitting me down  And just saying  Okay can you do this  Or will you do this  Or is there going to be  An altercation here  It was just like  Just such a cheap way out  Of just like giving me my release  And like okay  Well we're done with it  You know and it's just like man  I mean I love the WWE  And Vince McMahon 
[02:43:00]  Has been great to me  Over all the years  It just  I hate to end it  On such a sour note  It was just a poor way  To end things  Well you know  I'm an outsider  But we have relationships  With a lot of you guys  And we've done a lot  For the WWE  WWF  All that crap  And it seems like  A lot of people  Leave on a bad note  Over and over again  It just seems like  You know  People leave on a bad note  I don't really understand that  I don't  I mean like  For this one  There should have been  No reason for it  You know  Well Vince looks at it 
[02:43:30]  As a business  And unfortunately  Sure  He doesn't really care  About the personal crap  And he probably  You know I'm just playing  Devil's advocate  You're right  Right now Edge has more  Of a push  Because you were rehabbing  And out of the business  And Lita has more of a push  Because they're on TV  Every week still  So instead of really  Looking at the situation  Just went  Ah  He's more popular  At this moment  So it's so much easier  Just to release Matt Hardy  Which is in my opinion  A huge shame  Absolutely  It sure is  I mean  That's how it is 
[02:44:00]  Especially like you said  Don't want to deal with  The social problems  Or whatever  But then once again  You look at that crowd  And if you're going to have Edge  And you're going to have  Lead out there  Week in and week out  And people are chanting  We want Matt  And you screw Matt  And they demand Matt  Because it's such a bullshit situation  That I was the victim in  Hey Matt  When did you really know  That she was effing on you?  What was the one thing  Where you went  Oh my god  Where you felt it  In the pit of your stomach?  Honestly  It wasn't until  I got those phone messages  From Edge  That was the only proof positive 
[02:44:30]  Because  What do you mean by the phone messages?  From her machine?  No  From her cell phone  Where he had  He'd left all these phone messages  Just saying like  You know  Oh if I can't be with you  Then you know  I can't sleep at night  And please don't be with Matt  And da da da  And how did you get those messages?  I just pulled them off her phone  Yeah  Oh my god  Obviously because you had  Your suspicions  Yeah  That was the only  But you know what  I've never done that  You know  If I would have  If I would have been like  Our relationship was always so great  That we never even thought twice 
[02:45:00]  About that with each other  You know  She was out for 16 months  With a broken neck man  And I was on the road  I never compromised her integrity at all  Because our relationship was so cool  Just because we were like best friends  What gave you the suspicions  In the first place?  That you wanted to check your cell phone  Yeah  Yeah okay  You're right  But just because  We had  Went through a couple days  Where she just said  Like you know  I know  She said  My head's not where it needs to be  And I need to figure things out  Uh oh  I know I'm messing up  And I was just like  You know what is this all about?  I've never heard this from you  Yeah  And that's what it was  She'd actually told him 
[02:45:30]  That she didn't want to speak to him anymore  Because she wanted to get her head right  Because she knew she was screwing up  But  By the time  She was going to get her head right  It was too late  Because I'd already heard these messages from her  Matt I'm from the school of  One screw up  And it's over Johnny  Right  It's like you know  You can't  You just can never go back  And not think  First of all  That it's going to happen again  And just not get that  That deceit out of your head  It's uh  I'll tell you what man  It's uh  It's just terrible 
[02:46:00]  Because it takes  A really long time  To have something good  But it only takes a very short time  To destroy it  That's it  Oh god damn  That is rough  What a screw job  Jesus  So uh  That's what's really bad  You know  It's like  In the course of  You know  Just a few weeks  I lost my dream girl  And my dream job  Just  Both over bullshit reasons  You know what I mean  Wow  Wow  Well if it's any consolation  Uh  Opie and Jimmy are back together  As friends  It's cool man  I'll tell you what 
[02:46:30]  That definitely makes my day  It puts a smile on my face for the day  So  What do you want to happen  Uh  I don't know  That's a good question  That's a very good question  It seems like  Has it split the league  I mean  It seems like  There's more people  That are supporting you as well  Besides Chris Jericho right  Oh no  No question  Yeah  Man  No question  More people supporting me  Um  You know  I mean  There's nobody  There's nobody  That supports him  There's nobody  That can sit behind him  And support him  Yeah  Hey did you and Lee  To make any tapes  Or anything in the bedroom  There might be a few  Floating around  That's always a good way 
[02:47:00]  To get back  Yeah if you got one of those  Sex tapes releasing  We could uh  You never know what will pop up  We could host it on one of our websites  No problem for you  Oh thank you  No problem whatsoever  Jesus Christ  But uh  You know  I guess I'm at a point right now  You know  Thinking ahead  There are other places  To wrestle  You know  If you can't wrestle  In the WWE  The WWE is by far  The biggest place  And best place to wrestle  And once again man  I love the WWE  And I have nothing but  Good things to say  About my entire experience there  I just really hate how it ended  And I thought  I think things should have 
[02:47:30]  Ended differently  Is what I would say  You know  But there's  You know  There's definitely other places  To wrestle  And my brother  Jeff Hardy  Actually just watched him last night  He was on TNA  They have a little wrestling show as well  They had a pay-per-view  And he enjoys what he does down there  And there's several places  Across the world  And why is he out of the league  By the way  Uh  He's been out for  A couple years now  Just uh  He was very very burnt out  With the WWE schedule  And uh  There were a couple things  That uh  He just  He just really couldn't continue to do  While wrestling with the WWE 
[02:48:00]  So right now  He's at a deal where  He only uh  Works two or three days  Every couple weeks  So he loves our schedule  He just likes to stay at home all day  Wow man  And you really want to  Just beat the hell out of uh  Out of Ed, huh?  Well  Who wouldn't?  He's  He's my least favorite person in the world  I would definitely say that  And it would get ugly  If you saw him on the street  It wouldn't be pretty  Um  But uh  That just shows his character though  Yeah  I mean  It definitely  I mean  You know  Well  Once again  Like I said man  To cheat with your  He'd only been married 
[02:48:30]  He'd only been married for  Three months  Like when this went out  Are you kidding me?  He just got married  He just got married  On his second marriage  To cheat with your best friend's girl  That is  That's nuts  And you know  And he confessed to cheating  On both his wives  Jesus  You know  I mean  This guy's just a mess  I mean  This guy  Recently too  Like even  You know  He was on uh  Off the record  A Canadian  Uh  TV show  You know  He was  An admitted steroid user on there  Just said that he'd used them before  And that's why they were illegal  Scott also  When they were flying back 
[02:49:00]  Overseas  There was uh  One of the diva girls  That had a drink port on her  This was the guy that did that  I mean  He's done a ton of  Just  Just terrible things  As far as that goes  Does he have a lot of friends?  He shows his true quality  Does he have a lot of friends  In the WWE?  No  No  Wow  God  And even if somebody is  You know  Even if someone is social with him  I mean  Really  What can you think about a person  That has this characteristic?  Right  Yeah  Man you got screwed bro  Yep  That's for sure  So I mean right now man  Just like uh  Just uh  I'm sitting here  I guess uh  You know  Now is the time to promote myself 
[02:49:30]  For me to promote Matt Hardy  Well we got a  A huge audience that loves wrestling  You want them to chant anything out  Every time they see Lita?  Yeah  I mean I think  Every time they see Lita or  They should chant  We want Matt  You screwed Matt  I mean it's just a  A constant reminder  It's one thing  Like the whole thing  With Bret Hart  And the Montreal Screwjob  Just how they would  You know  Especially the Canadians  And even here in the states  They would never stop chanting  You know you screwed Brett  You screwed Brett  It was just nice  How they would never let  The WWE forget that  Now that's some of the best  Um  Video ever  When uh  Bret Hart spit on Vince McMahon 
[02:50:00]  Ooh  Yeah  That was just amazing  And then  And then Vince McMahon  What was it  They were filming some kind of documentary  On the WWF  When all that went down  And  And then uh  They had this thing happen  With Bret Hart  Too long to go into  Well basically  He was retiring  And they wanted him to retire  As a champion  In front of his  In front of his hometown  Hometown country  In front of his  In his country  In Canada  And at the last minute  Vince uh  Set up a different storyline  Didn't tell Bret Hart  And uh  Gave the championship 
[02:50:30]  To Triple H  I guess right  Yeah  It was Shawn Michaels  Actually  I was Shawn Michaels  I'm sorry  And uh  So Bret Hart  Realized he got a  Major screwjob  In front of his  Hometown fans  Up there in Canada  Looked at Vince  And went  Oh my god  After all I did for you  You screwed me  Spits in his face  It had nothing to do  With the storyline  And then uh  They turned off  The cameras out  As they went backstage  To talk about this  Uh huh  And all you see  Is Vince coming out  Of the locker room  Staggering  Because I guess  Bret Hart popped him  Really hard  Staggering with a shiner 
[02:51:00]  It is some of the best  Best video I've ever seen  Very funny  That whole documentary  On that thing  Yeah  It was a  It was a big deal  And you got it  You're pretty accurate  There in your description  Okay  Yeah  And rumor has it  Yeah  There was a huge  Convertation  That unfortunately  The cameras weren't  Rolling for  And Bret Hart  You know  Gave Vince a couple  Really really  Big shots to the head  And he's staggering  Down the hall afterwards  That's when they  Turn the cameras back on  Yeah  So  Alright Matt  I appreciate your honesty 
[02:51:30]  Man  Oh yeah  No problem  I don't know  Coming on our show  If it's actually  Going to help you  But  But at least  You get your side  Of the story out there  Well it's just  You know  I guess that's  Where I'm at right now  I mean  If I have to worry  About Matt Hardy  Then I have to worry  About Matt Hardy  Right  You know  It's just  You know  The story is what it is  Man  There's no denying it  You want to  Have you been  Banging other broads  Since Lita now  Well I've just made  The most of the time  I have  Yeah  You got to get back  On the horse  My friend  I'll just leave it at that 
[02:52:00]  I've made the most  Of the time  There you go  I'd imagine  You're fucking  Like a rabbit  Who are you kidding  That's what you got  To do  My friend  Yeah  Just going to bust  Too late  Actually there's  A company  Who has contacted me  Who's very interested  In sitting down  With myself and my brother  And I'm going to  Really sit down  And tell the story  From A to Z  And then plus  We're going to sit back  And talk about our whole career  And it's going to be  A really big deal  It's going to be  A big DVD set  And it's going to be  Available in some  In some different markets  In a mainstream way  So it's going to be  A very interesting thing 
[02:52:30]  I've got that project  Coming up in a couple weeks  And there's a ton of people  That have contacted me  All over about doing things  And who knows  The stuff you guys did  In the ring  Was just amazing  It was just amazing  It brought the tag team  To a whole other level  I mean jumping from the top  Of those ladders  And I mean all that stuff  No one was doing that  It was amazing  Yeah that was definitely  I remember  I think it was  I think it was  WrestleMania  When we went Anthony  In Sacramento  No it was Anaheim  Anaheim  We were basically  Invited by the WWF 
[02:53:00]  It was WWF at the time  And Anthony and I  We were pretty much  In the second or third row  Yeah it was insane  And you  That was the match  Where you guys  Somersaulted off the ladders  Yeah  But these ladders  Were extremely high  Not just a basic ladder  They were like  I don't know  15, 17 feet up  And you somersault  Not into the ring  But outside the ring  Remember that?  Yes  Yeah that was  My brother Jeff  Did a real big dive  On the aisle  I'm sure that's probably  The one you're talking about  That was the first ever 
[02:53:30]  Triple ladder match  It was a huge deal  But that's when I  Really truly had respect  For what you guys do  Because I remember  At the time  Looking at Jim Ross  Who was announcing the match  And the look on his face  Like I can't believe  He just did that  That's what we were doing too  We were going  We can't believe  We just did that  Yeah  Because I mean  A lot of times  You guys make this stuff up  As you go  And I just remember  The faces of the people  That see this stuff every day  So they're kind of jaded  And I saw the looks  On their faces like  Did they just do  What we just saw  And they weren't saying 
[02:54:00]  That on the air  To try to really  Push it over the top  This was just  Very natural reactions  And the cameras  Didn't capture that  Yeah  And that's when I realized  Man these guys are nuts  Yeah I mean  The first time  That we did  That was the first time  That we ever really  Did a match like that  Especially with three teams  And just everybody  Was watching in awe  Because it was just like  Oh my god  What are these guys  Going to do next  Are they going to  You know  They really thought  We were going to  Kill each other out there  And we almost did  Kill each other  Yeah let's go to  Shwoogie real fast  Shwoogie  Hey Matt  How you guys doing today  What's up 
[02:54:30]  Hey Matt  Here's your chance man  Let's shoot back  On Triple H  After his comment  What did Triple H say  Because he's  After his fire  Triple H was heard  Back stage saying  No big deal  He never drew any money  Anyhow  So Matt  Here's your chance  To shoot back  And please  Tell the world  All the marks  All the smarts  Know  What it's really like  There with him  Controlling everything  All I can say  I'd heard that comment  I don't know  If he truly said it or not  But I mean  If that is the comment  That he said  I mean  I think it's just  A pretty petty comment  I mean  You know  Matt Hardy  And Jeff Hardy  Were the 
[02:55:00]  You know  The Hardy boys  The tag team  And like  In the amount of time  We were together  As a tag team  No other tag team  Has sold that much merchandise  And there's no denying  The drawing power  That Jeff and I  Had together  I mean  We brought a whole new  Demographic  Into the WWE  And the wrestling business  I mean  For every  You know  We had a t-shirt  Constantly  We had merchandise constantly  And we sold it like crazy  And we were drawing  I mean  There were people  Young girls especially  That paid  To see Matt Hardy  And Jeff Hardy  I mean  So right there  You can already say  That you know  That I have made money  For the company  And then even  As a singles wrestler  When I was doing 
[02:55:30]  Matt Hardy  Version 1  The Sensate Mattitude  I mean  There was a point  Where I was the hottest  Thing on Smackdown  Especially when I was doing  That Cruiserweight title  Sensate Mattitude  Yeah  And then even  You know  I wasn't given  The ultimate opportunity  To like become  A top level draw  But even with what I was given  I made the most of it  And there were still people  That paid to see me  And I always had merchandise  Will you shoot on him  No about the way  Will you shoot on him  About the way  He just controls the backstage  Being married to Stephanie  Does he really?  You know Matt  You know  What's going on  About how he's  Promoting himself  Over Batista  How he does it  Over all the other champs 
[02:56:00]  Just so he can get  His belt back  I mean  Come on  The whole show  Revolves around him  And it really  Shouldn't be that way  And Jericho  Wanted to say it  Last week when he was on  But you know  That's the way it should be  You're saying  Because Triple H  Is married to  Vince McMahon's daughter  That he's really  Really controlling stuff  Oh without a doubt  He controls almost  Everything that goes on  If you watch the show  Whenever a new champ  Is crowned  Booking 101 says  That the new champ  Should be out to  Promote himself  Above all others  He should be made  As the champion  Everyone else  Is the challenger  The way it's been 
[02:56:30]  Over the last few  Champions  Interim champions  It's been all about  Triple H  And how he's going  To get his belt back  And it's so obvious  Because the next  Pay-per-view  What's coming up  It's being  Billed as  Triple H  Batista 2  And Triple H  Has all the camera  Time  Now granted  Batista's not the best  On the mic  But Triple H  Not last week  The following week  Opened the show  With a 20 minute promo  Saying about how  Great he was  And you don't do that 
[02:57:00]  He's stroking his own ego  And Matt  I know you probably  Will never do it  Because I know  You want to go back  To work  You probably  Eventually want to  Get back there  But you know  That's the way it is  Well I mean  I don't think  It's any secret  I mean the show  Revolves around Triple H  But you know  One thing that you do say  I think like  When you have Ben Waz  And Batista  As the champions  I mean I really think  You do need to focus  On them as being  The most important  Thing on the show  Alright let's take  One more call  Then we gotta move on here  Jeff in Philly  What's up  Hey guys  Hey  Matt  Yes  I'm going to be honest 
[02:57:30]  With you  I just love how you  Ruined the head  Hour of this show  This is horrible radio  Thank you  Horrible radio  I'm glad you enjoyed it  That much  I totally disagree  Because it's  You know  You don't have to  Like wrestling  To get into this  Subject  Appreciate real life  Drama  No shit  Jesus Christ  This stuff  The stuff that's  Being described  As you know  Matt's situation  The situation  With Triple H  Being married  To the boss's daughter  And that having  An influence  Over what goes on  It blows away

[03:05:30]  It's the darling of the rest  Of our lives  On all the days  Did you just say that Elton John's  Getting married?  That's what I'm reading  Is this a just in?  Breaking news  Elton John's gonna marry  From Reuters  British pop star  Elton John  Intends to marry  His long term partner  David Furnish 
[03:06:00]  Sometime this year  Or in 2006  His publicist said  On Monday  They want to hold  A civil partnership  In Windsor  Near London  In mid-December  Although publicist  Jerry  Gary Farrow  Said John has added  It could also take place  Sometime next year  One of John's main motivations  For going ahead  With the ceremony  Was financial  Civil partnerships  Between gay couples  Will be allowed  In Britain  From December 5th  And will give 
[03:06:30]  Partners tax breaks  Available to  Married couples  There you go  Like the guy has to  Worry about money  On any level  I guess  Look man  I'm  I don't know  I just think  There should be  Another term  I'm all for  That thing  That thing  The gays  Getting together  Big issue  I'm all for  The gays  Getting together  But I just think  It needs to be  Called something  Different  Getting  What  Oh sorry  Hold on 
[03:07:00]  Go ahead  Stop with the semantics  And still  Playing with his  Jimmy versus  Opie soundboard  Jimmy soundboard  Jimmy Opie soundboard  I don't know  Marriage  Yeah you think  It should be  Something else  Well marriage  Is you know  Has just been  Known for so long  A man and a woman  Getting together  I think Connecticut  Just did that though  They came  Came in and said  That it's a civil  Partnership  They're not calling  It marriage  But they're  Giving them the rights  And benefits  Available to married  Couples  But they're not 
[03:07:30]  Calling it marriage  Which seems to be  The problem like  Bush has with it  His biggest thing  Is the fact that  Marriage is sacred  And it's between  A man and a woman  As God intended  Blah blah blah  So his whole problem  Was the fact that  He's trying to  Protect marriage  Between a man and a woman  So now they call it  Something else  They should just  Call it something else  That's all  You're committed  To each other  And you get the benefits  Of being committed  To someone else  But that's where  I don't know  My head  Like just a  I don't know  A flare goes off 
[03:08:00]  Or something  Like marriage  It's just  I don't know  You think marriage  Is yeah  Man woman  Kind of thing  Two men  Going on their  Honeymoon  After a marriage  Yeah  Tell me more  Anthony  Yeah  Come on  One carries  The other one  Over the door  Threshold  Two hairy chests  In bed  One's in the bathroom  Getting his special  Lingerie on  The other one's  The other one's  In bed  On his side  Hand on hip  Looking at the door  Waiting for it to open up  To see what kind of  Treat they have 
[03:08:30]  Door opens up  And he goes  Oh  Billy  You're so fucking hot  His friends got together  And threw him a bridal shower  To give him that nice little piece of  One gets the bridal shower  The other gets the bachelor party  Right  Go to the male strip club  Can you just imagine Elton John  Having sex  To begin with  No  On any level  He's got to rip the wig off 
[03:09:00]  And put it on the night table  The completely bald headed Elton  Laying in bed  I don't think he's completely bald  I think he has one of those  Rim things  Yeah  He's got the horseshoe  Going around the back of his head  I think he has one of those  Horseshoes that starts at the sideburns  Yeah  Way low  And just goes around the back  And he puts the wig on  Ugh  Well good luck to you  Good luck to you Elton  Have fun with that one  Elton John  Alright  Uh pervs Anthony  Flashers on the subway 
[03:09:30]  Are you saying something  By that segway  Uh  Saying that gay man  Or perverse  No no no no no  Oh okay  Just singing into another  Sex thing I guess  Ah  Here's the latest thing by the way  You won't be hearing  Any more sound clips  From the argument  Alright  Because uh  This wasn't plugged in  And the laptop battery  Has just gone dead  Oh really  It is  Yeah  Ugh  So now the laptop battery  Is dead or something  It said low battery warning  And went dead  Well Mars is coming in 
[03:10:00]  To take a look  It said low battery  And then shut off  Alright  So good luck to you  They've been working on your laptop  All morning long  Anthony  Uh  Flashers in the subway  Total complaints since January  Forty five  Forty five complaints  On the subway  Since January  Yeah  And thirteen arrests  Mmhmm  Call them subterranean  Sleaze bags  About once every two days  Once every two days  Mmhmm  Perverts expose themselves  In the New York City subway system  According to police  Since January 
[03:10:30]  Police have received  Forty five complaints  Of public lewdness  In the city's  Subway system  Uh  There have been  Thirteen arrests  For public lewdness  Or the exposure  Of private parts  Okay  Many incidents  Of public lewdness  Or flashing  Go unreported  Anthony  Really  Unreported  But the numbers  Are in sync  With complaints  The posts received  From red faced  Strap hangers  Who have seen  Plenty of skin  In the subways  Skin  This is where  It gets good  Uh  Here's a girl  Talking  I was waiting  For the G train 
[03:11:00]  And a man  Probably about  Fifty  Across the tracks  Was fondling his  Well  John Thomas  Said Kirsten  Fairly appalling  If you ask me  Got to love New York  So this woman  Probably just wants  To get home  To her stupid  Tiny little apartment  Waiting for the subway  And there's a guy  On the other side  On the other side  Just jacking  Just cranking  Probably staring  Right at her  Like a monkey  Staring because  There's a track  In between them  Yeah  Nothing's gonna happen 
[03:11:30]  To him  No one's gonna  Jump down there  Take a look at me  Honey  Yeah look at this  Honey  I gotta tell you  If she's a grown woman  And this is happening  And like I told you  He's not taking it  To the next level  And trying to pounce  On her  Or any of that  Sick shit  I think you gotta  Think as a woman  It's just silly  And really  Kind of funny  In your head  To see something  Like this  I mean are you  So disturbed  That it's gonna  Affect you mentally  You think  Some people would  Say that yeah  It's affecting me  Mentally  I now have nightmares  And blah blah blah  You know what it is 
[03:12:00]  This is the fundamental  Difference between men  And women  And why there are  Differences  And the fact that  You can't get around them  We love to think  That we're all equal  And men and women  Should all  Have the same  I don't know  Should be the same  For some reason  But it's not  Because if you're  Standing on the tracks  And you look across  The tracks  And some girl  Doesn't have to be  A beautiful girl  You know  Can't be some  Disgusting mess  But it doesn't have  To be like a model  Just be a girl 
[03:12:30]  Standing across the way  She lifts up her skirt  And just starts  Fingering herself  Are you gonna go  Oh it's a hauling  This is a haul  I'm gonna miss my subway  Right  Your train could come  And go  And you would hope  She's still there  When the train leaves  Right  Because you're gonna  Stand there and go  Holy shit  That girl's diddling herself  You'll call your friends  She could be a four  And you're still  Right  You're still watching  Oh yeah  Meanwhile you know  You'll be late for dinner  Yep  You don't care  You'll be late for work  Then you'll have to  Go into work  And come up with 
[03:13:00]  Some stupid excuse  Why you're late  That is the fundamental difference  And that comes into play  In the workplace  And every other aspect  Of our lives  As men and women  This basic thing  Comes into play  Everywhere  So we will never  Be on equal footing  As men and women  But why is it always  Just guys jacking  In public  It's what we do  You never hear  About the women  Doing this  Because they don't  Again  There's that difference  For some reason  Guys feel compelled 
[03:13:30]  To pull it out  And start jacking it  Alright  Well this girl  Rishma  Had a similar experience  On the N train  Anthony  When it stopped  At Times Square  Hold on a minute  I don't even need  This clip today  But what the hell  When it stopped  At Times Square  A large man  Came to the corner  Of the door  Still standing outside  Stared directly at me 
[03:14:00]  And opened up  His jacket  To reveal  A full erection  That's terrific  That's terrific  That's terrific  Could you imagine  So the door opens  You know  When you're on the subway  You're waiting for that  Door to close  Subway takes off  Obviously  While this guy  Steps up to the open door  Just opens up his coat  To show you  A full erection  That's great  You have to be laughing inside  As long as the guy 
[03:14:30]  Is not touching you  Or trying to do anything  No threats there  Right  He's on the other side  Of the door  You're leaving  It's gotta just be  That's a dick  Alright  In full throbbing erection  I let out a loud gasp  And instantly  Everyone in the train  Turned to me  As if I was crazy  Completely missing  The mad flasher  At the door  I was brought to tears  Yeah  I don't  I just don't believe that  Brought to tears  I was brought to tears  By laughing  Or by being crazed  With  It sounds like  She was so upset 
[03:15:00]  She was so upset  By the flasher  That she was brought to tears  As this was my first experience  With a flasher  Jesus  I hate to tell  It's just  I mean  It's just silly  Again  You're in a train  A woman comes to the door  I'm talking  There's no kids around  Okay  There's  The guy isn't trying  To make a move on you  Or trying to pounce you  Or try to follow you home  He just wants you  To see him naked  Right  It's just  In my mind  Seems like it's just  Really silly  To see 
[03:15:30]  It's  Hysterically funny  The train door closes  And some guy  With a rod  Just opens his coat  Like look at me  Look at me  Look at me  I've got a rod  If you saw a chick  Open her coat up  Completely naked  All obviously aroused  That'd be great  You'd hit that  Stop the train button  You're not going to be  Yeah exactly  You know  You're not going to be  Brought to tears  No  The post even received  The complaint  About an MTA employee 
[03:16:00]  A man identifying himself  As Bob  Tootsky  Said he saw a conductor  Masturbating  While whispering  While whistling  Excuse me  While whistling  Don't worry  Be happy  The guy is  He's a conductor  Yeah on one of these subways  And he's just  Jacking it  And whistling  This song  Don't worry  Be happy  Now that's funny 
[03:16:30]  It's beyond funny  It's beyond funny  Going up and down  The train aisle  Taking tickets  Yeah  Tickets please  Excuse me  Are you  Yes I am  Tickets  Alright  Be happy  The crimes have spiked  In recent years  But are still  Grossly underreported  Says Anthony  Grossly  It's more of a transit thing 
[03:17:00]  Said a Greenwich Village  Officer  It doesn't happen  On the street  As much  The subways  Are more of an  Anonymous environment  They can do it  Where it's crowded  And they can leave  Without being identified  That's it  So there you go  I don't get the whole thing  About like wanting  People to see you  Naked or aroused  Or something like that  People have such  Strange things  That get them off  That's  You know  What's the  What's the  What is it about  Having a rod  Under your coat  And then like 
[03:17:30]  Showing someone  Right before they roll away  Are you looking for  Some kind of reaction  From the girl  Maybe that's it  And then what does that do  Are you able to  Remember that  And jack off  Thinking about it  Like  I don't get it  Let's go to  Kirsten in Boston  Kirsten  Hey guys  How are you  I'm doing good  How are you  How about your Red Sox  Huh  How about them  Thugs  What a bunch of thugs  With their brawling  I love it  Boy you gotta love Boston  Is the whole city  Going out to see  Fever pitch  Oh 
[03:18:00]  Probably  Not me though  Alright  But I have to tell you  It's happening in Boston  As well  As far as the tea  Same thing  Yeah  I'm getting on last summer  It's really hot  Of course  There's no air conditioning  Or anything  I have like a little  Summer dress  No big deal  I'm just standing there  Waiting to get on  I get on  I swear to god  This man had to be  Somebody's grandfather  He's like 60 years old  And he had this long coat on  So immediately I'm going  Oh my god  Keep your head down  Keep your head down  Because you know  You don't want to ever  Make eye contact  Even here in Boston 
[03:18:30]  I look up briefly  And he's got this  Awful nasty grin on  And opens up the coat  With his skinny little  Nasty skin hanging off  On me  In the smallest rod  I've ever seen in my life  And he looked at me  Like hey  Look at this  Get some  And I looked at him  I go  If I were you  I would close that  Because that's nothing  For me to look at  And Kirsten  Just walked on the train  And you weren't  Brought to tears right  You gotta be  Well that's the thing  Yeah  Weren't you  Weren't you kind of 
[03:19:00]  Laughing inside like  That is one of the  Silliest things I've ever seen  I was laughing outside  Honey  I was looking at him  Like oh okay  That did a lot for me  You're pathetic  And any woman  That says oh  Spark to tears  Is just what gives  Women a bad name  Yeah  Alright  That's all I had to share  Because it was the funniest  I told everybody I knew  I'm like I saw  The ugliest penis today  I saw old man penis  What is it about  The old guys too  That like doing this  I know  And I'm thinking  This is somebody's  Grandfather  And I mean like  I'm a decent looking girl  But I don't expect that 
[03:19:30]  And I saw the coat  And I'm going oh shit  Keep your head down  Yeah it's like a hot day  And the guy's wearing  A trench coat  Yeah  Big clue  Big clue  Especially on the train  And then you should have  Seeing the grin on his face  Like hey look at me  Honey  He knew he had a fish  On the hook right there  Had you looking  I looked right at him  I'm like if I were you  I would close that back up  There pumpkin  That's nothing for me  To be looking at  Old man rock  It happens everywhere boys  And I love you  I'm so glad you're back on  I was at Bill's bar  I had a great time  You guys are the best  Thanks Kirsten 
[03:20:00]  Go Sox  Alright go Sox  Bye  Alright let's go to  Krista the blind girl  On Long Island  Oh we haven't heard  From her in a while  Krista what's up  I just want to  I agree with  Kirsten entirely  It's just something  Wait why are you  Commenting about flashers  She went up  And actually  Felt a guy's rod  What is this guy doing  He's  Oh my goodness  Wait are we so desperate  For phone calls today  That we're going to have  A blind girl comment  On subway flashers  Also I just think  It's a testament  To the way the papers are 
[03:20:30]  I mean they're not going  To interview the girl  Who just thinks it's silly  And is cracking up over it  Yeah they want it to sound  A lot worse than it is  It's going to be appalling  It's going to be big news  Yeah I think you're  I honestly think  If you're affected by this  And I have to say again  They're not underage girls  That this is happening to  They're adults  And nothing else is going on  There's no following  There's no touching  No come on  You're mentally unstable  If you're not looking at that  Going oh my god  That is so freaking funny  And silly  Unfortunately 
[03:21:00]  The guys that do this  Don't care where they're doing it  Or who's watching  So a lot of times  There are kids  That are looking  But the adults  That are looking  You know  Just get over it  Maybe part of you  Is horrified  Because you're convinced  Maybe it's going to go  To the next level  I guess  If I'm trying  To see all points of this  It probably would shock you  Take you by surprise  Things like that  But  You're on the other side  Of the train track  But when you realize  The guy is truly harmless  And it's over like that  You've got to be laughing  To yourself all the way home  Like did I just see  What I saw  Kind of as nut as that 
[03:21:30]  All right  So what else  Do you got Krista  Well that's what  I wanted to say  I also one time  I was on a bus  And I heard  An older lady  Kind of giggling about it  She had seen  Some guy  Flash her  With her  With his dick  And she was kind of  Giggling about it  To her friend on the bus  Eavesdropper  How could she not  Her hearing is so much  Better than everyone else's  That's super hearing  That conversation  Wasn't even happening  On your bus  It was the bus behind you  She's amazing  Anything else 
[03:22:00]  In your blind life  Got a boyfriend  Yeah I have a boyfriend  Yeah he's blind too right  Yep  You guys remember huh  Of course we do  You remember the deal  Yeah of course  All right  Well thank you Krista  You guys rule  All right  Wow we're  Check out  We're really reaching today  I guess  Why  A blind girl is  Commenting on our  Flasher story  She told us that  She heard somebody  Talking that they  Had seen a flasher  So  All right the other  Big story today  Is the  You heard  Did you hear about  This skydiver 
[03:22:30]  Yeah this sucks  Oh  This is either  A sucks to be you  Or an unlucky lottery  I don't even know  How this would happen  Yeah we're trying  To figure this one out  It doesn't make sense  To me  Not at all  It happened in Florida  Skydivers hit  Killed by plane  A man who was skydiving  In central Florida  Was killed when he was  Struck by the wing  Of a plane  As he descended  Over an airport  Losing both his legs  In the accident  Now you read  The first paragraph  You're thinking  Okay the guy  Jumps out of an airplane  Actually here's the  First thing I thought 
[03:23:00]  He's jumping out  Of the plane  And the  As he jumped  Somehow  Where the door  Was situated  The way the plane  Was flying  That the plane's  Wing clipped him  As he came out  Of the door  Of the plane  That's what I thought  Okay  But he was already  Descending  Yeah  He jumped out  Of this plane  He was already  On his parachute  He already pulled  The cord  And he was  Floating down  Yeah so I'm thinking  Another plane  Happened to be in the area  And just like him  Right  Which the odds  Of that happening  Are I mean  Just imagine 
[03:23:30]  Pretty slim  So it goes on  To say Albert Wing  Albert Wing  Is his name Wing  Stop it  There are so many stories  Where the last name  You know  Fits into the actual  Freaking story  Albert Gus Wing  What are the odds  What are the odds  That his last name's Wing  And that killed him  Albert Wing was hit  By the airplane  That he had jumped  From Saturday morning  Police said the skydiver  Had opened his parachute  When the left wing 
[03:24:00]  Struck him at about  600 feet  Oh  Alright so obviously  If he's 600 feet  From the ground  He jumped out of his plane  Floating down to the ground  He's only 600 feet  From the ground  And then gets hit by  It looks like the plane  That he jumped out of  It's the same plane  He jumped out of  Hit him  And cut his legs off  His legs were  Severed at the knees  But he managed to land  Near an airport  Now you're floating down  And you've got 600 feet left  And you don't have legs  And you don't have legs  And you land on your feet  You know  Now you're going to land  On your stumps 
[03:24:30]  His legs were severed  At the knees  But he managed to land  Near an airport  Okay  Wing was taken to a hospital  Where he died  Of his injuries  The airplane landed safely  And police investigators  Observed damage  To the plane's left wing  Oh there were 14 other  Skydivers in the air  At the time  Man the pilot  Of that plane  So he's up there  He lets all 14  You know skydivers go  Yeah  And then he has to land  The plane back at the airport  He just was in a panic  I guess  He probably turned around 
[03:25:00]  And saw like  Just these guys  With their chutes open  All around him  And nails this one guy  And cuts his legs off  Oh  And his name is Wing  Which is the most  Fascinating part of that  Oh  That's terrific  That's terrific  I think that's a  Sucks to be you  Sucks to be you  Yeah I haven't figured out  Why yet  But it doesn't hit me  As an unlucky lottery  Okay  Yeah  Let's go to Chris  In Memphis  Hey  Mega dittos guys  You guys are  You sick freaks  And you're 
[03:25:30]  Two great Americans  Mega dittos  Jesus  What's up Chris?  Thank you sir  Hey  Well I don't know  No I can understand  How this could happen  I'm a student pilot myself  And  When you're flying  Especially when you're  In the pattern  And you're going in  You know to land  You're concentrating  On other aircraft  In the area  Especially if it's  An untowered airport  You know  I don't know what this  I don't know the particulars  Of this situation obviously  But you know  Other than what  You guys just read  And I've read on the internet  But if you're  If you're just in a pattern  And you're you know 
[03:26:00]  Listening to the radio  For other aircraft  And you know  That there's other  You know the sky drivers  Are there  Most likely  I mean especially  With a person  If  Unless you're looking  Straight at him  And you can see him  Right there  I mean you're not  Looking up above you usually  Because I mean obviously  The skydiver is falling  You know down  You know that can  Come into your path  Without you even  Knowing about it  You're looking  Most of the time  You're looking straight ahead  Into your periphery  And it's probably  A top wing plane  So it's kind of hard  To see if he was  Above the wing  Exactly  In the guy's vision

[03:27:30]  The flashers  And I have a friend  Of mine  She works at one  Of the local hospitals  In Manhattan  And she was telling me  She was coming out  One day  And she noticed  This guy stood  In one of the vehicles  And he was  You know  Fonding himself  So she went over  And sat there  Next to him  By his vehicle  While he continued  And he couldn't finish  Because he was  Just astonished  That she stood there  And watched  Wow cramped his style  Yeah you know  She thought it was  Kind of amusing  And when she told me  The story  You know  I just hit  You know  I fell on the floor  I just really thought 
[03:28:00]  You know  That was pretty cool  You know  She just called  A morph guard  You know  See that seems like  That would be  The perfect thing  For one of these guys  That liked jacking  In the car  If a girl just came up  And started looking  It's like wow  I don't even have to  Work for this one  You know  Kind of finish it up  But that  Exactly  But it screwed  The guy all up  It just goes to show you  What mental patients  These guys are  Alright  But listen  I was listening to y'all  And Matt  When I was in Brooklyn  I moved out to Augusta  And it wasn't by my choice  You know  The old lady  Y'all  Around the Christmas holiday  There was a song  Y'all played  For Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer 
[03:28:30]  And he was hung  Like a mighty bull  Okay  I couldn't quite remember  The name of it  I was hoping  Maybe one of y'all  Could play that one  Because I mean  When I first heard it  Yeah  In December  Yeah when the calendar  Hits December  No problem  Remind us  Maybe we'll do  Christmas in July  Opie  Yeah other radio stations  Do that  Your brother's  Checking in  Brother Joe  What's going on guys  Long time no hair  Hey  How the hell are ya  You know what  You know what I think  Happened there  With that guy  Who was skydiving  What  A lot of times  Like the drop zones 
[03:29:00]  Are right around  Where the  Where the airports are  So that plane  Joe was a parachuter  The pilot  I think 600 feet  Off the ground  Yeah  You know that student pilot  Beat me to the punch here  Takes a little while  To get through to you guys  These days  Even if you are  Anthony's brother  Do you think  So what do you think  Happened  I'm thinking that  The plane  The plane was definitely  On final  And because you know  I was a student pilot  Too  The  You know the guys  Concentrating on a lot  More going on  The dude that was  The dude that was  On the  You know that was 
[03:29:30]  Parachuting  Was coming down  You know the drop zone  That was close to the airport  For what you said  And the plane was on final  The plane was landing  Good place to be  They happened to meet  That is the  That is the unlucky lottery  Good place for the parachute  Guy to be  The skydiver to be  Right in the pattern  Of the like final approach  Absolutely horrible  But yeah I mean  You had to see  The clusterfucks  That we had  When I was in the army  When I was  Jumping from the  C-130s  Yeah apparently  A lot more people  Get killed in the army 
[03:30:00]  During like training  Oh yeah  And you never hear about it  In the news or something  But  No  Shoots fail all the time  And reserves fail  A lot too  And I mean  Not only that  But you know  You have jumpers  That get  That get towed  Towed jumpers  That's an ugly way to go  If you don't break away  Like they jump  Static line  All soldiers  Jump static line  And  That's where the plane  Itself pulls the ripcord  Instead of you  Having to pull it  So  It won't pull it 
[03:30:30]  And they'll be  Getting dragged  By a jet  Yeah by  Either a turbo prop  Or a jet  Doing  Doing several hundred  Miles an hour  You kind of  Bang off the side  Like click clack  And what are you  Supposed to do  To get out of that  Situation  They tell you  To show that  You're still conscious  You're supposed to  Put your  Left hand  On your  Steel pot  On your helmet  And hold  The reserve  With your right hand  And then they  Cut you loose  But obviously  If they cut  The static line  Loose  You have to 
[03:31:00]  Pull your reserve  And if you're  Knocked out  You can't pull  Your reserve  Now what if  You're knocked out  If you're knocked out  They try to pull you  Back in  But  Doing a couple  Of hundred miles  An hour  It's kind of  Rough to get you  Back in the plane  So  If you  Are knocked out  And you're just  Hanging there  Like a rag doll  They will land  With you  Attached  To the plane  They foam  The runway  So you don't  Get all chewed  Yeah  We used to  Call that  An airborne enema  No one survives 
[03:31:30]  That though  Right Joe?  No  There were a couple  Of guys that did  Yeah  Getting dragged  Down a runway  Yeah pretty much  You know  You have all that  Foam that's  Supposed to keep you  From getting  You know  Getting road rash  When you're  Being dragged  Down a runway  A couple  Of hundred miles  An hour  Wow  That is brutal  They cut away  From their chutes  That looks like  They're going to  Land in the water  So they'll cut away  From their mane  You know  And do like  A beautiful swan  Dive into water 
[03:32:00]  And it turns out  To be a gigantic  Puddle  That's only about  Four inches deep  So they free fall  From about  75-80 feet up  That's amazing  Yeah just  Really really  Nasty things  That happen  They do  Some have  Landed in deep  Water  And the chute  Comes down  And just buries  You and you  Get tangled up  In your suspension  Lines and drown  There's a million  Ways to go  Skydiving  Not just by  Failing chute  Wow  Hey Joe  I read  I read your  Instant feedback  Why don't you  Give out your  Email address

[03:37:00]  He's done a lot of great songs for the show, but that's one of my favorites right there.  Poor Joe missed our vacation.  You know, our vacation was supposed to be a whole family thing, you know?  My whole family.  All the neighborhood, the whole neighborhood where my mom and Sal live.  A bunch of people.  And right before vacation, Joe starts getting this nosebleed, like a week before we were going to leave.  And thinks it's just nosebleed, you know?  It's not stopping, though.  Wouldn't stop.  Wends up going to the emergency room, and it's like a broken blood vessel, 
[03:37:30]  but it's not in a place that they can really pack it and get to it.  It's like way up in like a sinus.  Dude, they had to pack his nose from the back through what they call the soft palate.  I'm going to be spitting.  They had to go through his mouth, you think?  Yes.  So they went through the mouth and tucked the gauze up backwards, up into the nose,  and then through the front.  And, you know, while we're in the Caribbean on a boat,  my brother's laying in a hospital bed with his nose packed with the gauze. 
[03:38:00]  For how many days?  The whole week.  Like one of the whole weeks.  And then they unpacked it, and it had stopped bleeding.  So he was able to go home, and he wanted to, you know,  take a flight out that day to catch the boat and maybe at one of the ports.  But that wouldn't have been wise.  And his room, I guess, was already gone or something.  Oh, my God.  The cruise company just rinsed it out.  You guys waited like two years for that vacation.  Yeah, it was about a year.  About a year.  And he just got this ridiculous nosebleed. 
[03:38:30]  So we were calling him every day from a satellite phone.  Not to rub it in.  No, no.  Okay.  But that's just it.  We want to know.  We want to make sure he's okay and stuff.  And usually on cruises, you can't get a hold of anybody.  So I'm calling him on the satellite phone and trying not to sound like I'm having fun.  It's like, how you doing?  And stuff.  He goes, good.  The doctor's going to check it out tomorrow.  He's going to go pull the gauze out of my nose and make sure.  He's talking like that?  Yeah, because it was just packed.  How bad did you feel?  I felt really bad.  Imagine calling from the deck in the middle of the ocean with a nice cocktail. 
[03:39:00]  I was out.  I'm out.  All he's hearing.  Do they have any, like, Jamaican, what's that, those instruments?  The steel drum?  The steel drum.  Do you have, like, steel drum stuff?  Or Jamaican music, even, is fine.  Well, this is the best we're going to get.  Well, this is kind of the background.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, so, um, um, they pack my nose with gauze. 
[03:39:30]  I don't know.  If the bleeding doesn't stop, they might have to go, I have to go to a specialist where they'll  actually cauterize the wound.  Wow, Joe.  That sounds like, are you, like, bad for you?  Yeah, I'll be right there.  Yeah.  I'll be right there.  Uh, no, save my spot in the Congo line.  I'll be right there.  Now, two banana daiquiris, and get me some towels, because I'm going to lay in this beach  chair here.  And the blood was dripping into the back of my throat, and I could taste it the whole 
[03:40:00]  time, and it was, it's really, yeah.  Well, how's the cruise going?  Um, yeah, it sucks, Joe.  It really isn't, uh.  No, that chick should put her top on.  Yeah, well, it says I'm going to have to be here until, like, Saturday.  Saturday.  Sign me up for the limbo contest.  Saturday.  You'll be in there until Saturday?  Let me think.  Saturday.  I think we're at St. Thomas on Saturday. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's where we are.  Saturday.  I think that's the day I'm going to be doing some jet skiing.  Yeah, maybe a little jet skiing, maybe some parasailing on that Saturday.  Brother Joe.  This fucking heart was sick.  Dude, I felt so bad for you.  It sucked.  Hey, you know what they're saying?  This could probably, uh, the doctor said it was impossible to do what they call digital  trauma.  Digital trauma.  They call it digital trauma that deeply. 
[03:41:00]  Like, it was what they call a posterior bleed.  You can't see where it was coming from, so they couldn't cauterize it.  Otherwise, it would have gone.  But the digital trauma is picking your nose.  Now, who knows about digital trauma?  My doctor.  Oh, he's an expert on that digital trauma.  That's up the ass, though.  You might be able to relate to this.  One Sunday morning, I'm laying in bed.  My nose is really dry, and I had this.  It was a fucking rivet of snot all the way up my nostril.  Yeah.  So you kind of, you know, your pinky is dry. 
[03:41:30]  Your nostril is dry.  You reach up there, and you're really fucking wang at it.  Oh.  You're like, go for it.  Oh, I hate these stories, boogers.  Yeah.  I don't make a habit of doing this, but when you have one of those dried up boogers that  will not fucking let loose when you blow your nose, you got to do this, right?  It's like having a Japanese star up in your nose, one of those Chinese stars.  What ended up happening was, I think what I did now, Doc says it's almost impossible  to do this, but I think I actually tore a blood vessel due to the motion of the nostril, 
[03:42:00]  not even, like, digging in with your fingernail or getting through to, like, one of the capillaries  that are on the surface.  I broke a major blood vessel back there.  Yeah.  I snapped it in half, so it wasn't healing.  What would happen was when it would start bleeding, it would bleed so heavy that the blood  would coagulate, and I would blow a fucking red jellyfish out of my nose.  It was like that scene from Poltergeist when that thing was coming out of the guy's nose.  Yeah.  That bad. 
[03:42:30]  And they couldn't stop it from, you know, by using standard methods.  They had to put me in the hospital for eight fucking days.  Eight days while we were on a ship.  Not moving.  I had to lay in the hospital for eight days.  I called him from my deck once out of my room, and it was so, like, I hear,  the water just kind of splashing against the ship's hull, looking out of a blue water,  and he's just talking.  I can't see the old man pissing next to me.  That's a lot of Joe's earring.  The old man's bedpan. 
[03:43:00]  We're running out of time, Joe.  All right, brothers.  I'll talk to you guys soon.  All right, man.  All right, Joe, everyone.  He was miserable.  Yeah, it's awful.  I wish I could, you know, damn, I'm so pissed.  I wish I could be there.  No, you really don't want to be here.  You don't want to.  Yeah, no, I'll be in the pool.  One minute.  Program complete. </pre>
