<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts.  This segment heavily featured news clips of a Canadian news reporter being twice interrupted during live broadcasts, once by a man yelling "fuck her right in the pussy" during a soccer report and again during a Pride report (details of the second interruption are unspecified).  The pre-show also covered Opie's World Cup enthusiasm (contrasted with Anthony's disinterest unless the US is playing), Whoopi Goldberg's contradictory stances on offensive language, a viral Australian trend of young people urinating in their own mouths, offensive Yankee Stadium chants recounted by a caller ("Bald Vinny"), a rapper who self-mutilated and is now promoting an album, a black school president impersonating white men on Instagram, E-Rock's passionate beer reviews (including a chocolate peanut butter porter), and a lengthy discussion about 4DX movie theaters, including a call with a film reviewer wearing a "Not Sam" shirt.  Several callers contributed to the pre-show's irreverent and often offensive tone. E-Rock was the only guest besides callers in studio during the pre-show.

The main show opened with continued discussion about 4DX movie theaters, featuring a guest named Jermaine (wearing a “Not Sam” shirt) and a debate over its value versus IMAX.  Opie's frugality was highlighted, specifically his six-hour round-trip drive to Boston instead of staying in a hotel.  The conversation drifted to Opie's free wrestling memorabilia, a new “American hero” (unidentified), the movie *Hercules*, The Rock’s career, and the overwhelming popularity of "Let It Go" from *Frozen*, including listener parodies and a Pearl Jam cover. Opie's claim of owning five televisions was met with skepticism.  A substantial portion focused on internal company drama, including the recent firing of Tim and an upcoming meeting with Greenstein, described as bringing "horse shit" to meetings.  Awkward banter between the hosts followed.  The show then shifted to The Who’s upcoming tour and album, speculating on the reception of new music from established bands,  leading to a discussion about Pearl Jam's enduring popularity and concert experience. Sandy Kane, a previous litigant against the show, called in to promote her new CD.  The show also touched upon several viral videos, including one featuring the phrase "fuck her right in the pussy," debated as both genuine and fake. A "Big Birthday Bash" was mentioned, but details were absent.

A further segment began with a discussion of the female news reporter accosted on live television, including speculation about her appearance and sexuality.  A caller, Brad from Kentucky, claimed to have recorded the incidents, though the hosts expressed skepticism. This transitioned into a discussion of Sandy Kane's upcoming CD and her past as a stripper and sex worker, detailed in a pre-recorded segment, which included frank discussions of drug use and sexual encounters, including an STI.  Denny Falcone made a brief appearance, gifting the hosts guitar picks and a camera.  The hosts then discussed their past voyeuristic observations from their studio windows, reminiscing about similar experiences at K-Rock and N.E.W., which involved observing women showering.

The broadcast continued with planning for Fourth of July radio programming, focusing on a "Muscle Car Weekend" on the 70s on 7 channel, and brainstorming appropriate songs, leading to discussions about song color themes (blue, white, red) and tangents about various artists.  Further discussion of Denny Falcone, a Mick Jagger video, critiques of musical genres (including jazz), and the World Cup with suitable music choices followed, concluding with more commentary on Denny's contributions and opinions.

A chaotic segment ensued with Sandy Kane in studio. The conversation became vulgar and sexually explicit, focusing on Sandy Kane's new song, "I Love Nick,"  the physical attributes of various men (including deceased comedian David Brenner), drug use (marijuana and cocaine), and Sandy Kane's religious experiences.  The hosts played "I Love Nick," with mixed listener reactions.  Commercial breaks and discussions of Christopher Cross's career and a caller repeatedly hanging up were interspersed.

A recurring segment featured "I Love Nick," and Sandy Kane's in-studio discussion of past experiences including a gangbang, drug use (cocaine, angel dust, peyote), and her arrest by the NYPD (inspiring a new song, "I Got Arrested by the NYPD").  Sexually explicit conversations, discussions of drugs and sexual acts, and extensive commentary on the World Cup (criticizing its pacing and lack of scoring) continued, interspersed with commercial breaks.  A Patrice O’Neal bit on the World Cup was mentioned for later.

The show included a segment with comedian Patrice O'Neal, receiving praise from the hosts, followed by numerous commercial breaks (SelectQuote, Warner Enterprises, Dave Smith Motors, Lumosity, Xbox One).  The post-show with Sam Roberts centered on Sandy Kane, focusing on her career, experiences in Times Square, selling urine in a peep show (including a story about a 90-year-old man drinking it), past sexual experiences (including a preference for oral sex), and a humorous exchange about a man named Bobo and his small penis.  Listener calls sharing interactions and anecdotes with Sandy Kane concluded the broadcast, along with more commercials and promotion of Sam Roberts' upcoming Friday show with guests T.I., Clark Gregg, and Linda Perry.

Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show with Sam Roberts. 
[00:01:00]  Here we are. Welcome, welcome.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  My name is Sam Roberts.  We are live, counting down the moments before Opie and Anthony hit the airwaves.  One more time, it is Tuesday.  Go ahead and call up now, 866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  And you too can be a part of the Opie and Anthony pre-show as we go over everything that could be happening today on the O&A show. 
[00:01:30]  And everything that went down yesterday that we can learn from.  Of course, the U.S. is going to be playing World Cup soccer later on this afternoon.  So I'm sure that Opie and Anthony are going to be talking about the World Cup.  It'll be interesting to see, though.  Because I'm not convinced that Anthony is sold on this World Cup thing.  It seemed like after the last U.S. game, Jim was into the last U.S. game. 
[00:02:00]  He doesn't... Opie's all in.  Opie, I think it's clear to everybody, is all in.  And he's got World Cup fever.  However, Jim only seems to be interested when the United States is playing.  And I don't think Anthony's interested yet.  So it'll be interesting to see where they're at in terms of the U.S. playing today.  If they're excited or not.  Opie's already in there.  He's got it.  He's got it bad.  He's ready for this game.  And if you watch the news anchors, I can see it right through. 
[00:02:30]  They're wearing their U.S. jerseys.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  We'll see how they cover it today.  We had a lot to cover yesterday.  A lot going on in the news.  We got into the discussion about words hurting.  Now, there are new words hurt stories that we're going to get into today on the Opie and Anthony show.  But yesterday, we were talking about the view of all shows.  And Whoopi Goldberg.  Whoopi Goldberg went on the air and associated a response that a white male was making. 
[00:03:00]  is a typical white male response.  As she was talking about race and words hurting.  Which, in principle, does seem a little bit unfair.  But let's listen to how this clip went down and the guy's reaction to it.  From the fighting Irish to the redskins, everybody's offended.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  That is broken like a true white guy.  Maybe.  Oh, there you go.  Throw a race in there.  Because if you...  And then everyone chuckles. 
[00:03:30]  I would say, well, what you're saying is you're just being like a true black woman.  There.  There.  That's you.  And forget politics.  Yeah.  Have you had the experience where...  Oh, here's your voice.  I don't know what your background is, so I don't even know how to refer to it.  Okay, where you said, you know, when I first came here, this is what they did to me, and  this is how they treated me, and this is what they can't to me, and this is what they  call...  The argument isn't...  No, no, but have you had that experience?  No, I have not had that experience. 
[00:04:00]  She's like, okay, now shut up, you can't argue.  There's no such thing as offensive words.  It's how you react to them.  You don't shut people up because you disagree or found something they said somewhat offensive.  You roll on with your life.  No, no, no.  Whoopi doesn't think her act, the shit she says in her act, offends people?  That's how fucking...  What about the Ted Danson wearing blackface?  Yeah, yeah.  That was a hoot.  Yeah, they booked out the word, nigger.  People will still be using it to hurt.  People are sensitive.  Yeah.  Don't use it. 
[00:04:30]  Period.  Or use it as an opening for a discussion like...  That is hilarious.  That guy's voice.  He sounds like a woman.  That is the most womanly voice.  It's Ross.  Yeah, it is.  Ross Matthews.  No, this is Dan.  Sorry, sir.  There's a ton of things.  Wow.  The gist, though, the fact that Whoopi is arguing about words, you could probably take any part  of her act and offend somebody with it.  Of course.  And if you told her, look, we're offended by this, maybe you shouldn't use that language, 
[00:05:00]  she should have every right and be completely in the right to say, go fuck yourself.  Of course.  She should know better.  Why do liberals think what they're saying and doing is the right thing and everyone  else is wrong?  They do what they do.  And if you criticize them, you're either racist, homophobic, or all the other lists.  But then they're the ones that could do and say whatever they please because they're just  a little smarter and they know better and how to use it. 
[00:05:30]  And they don't have any ill will or malintent in their words.  God, it's such bullshit.  Whoopi should be the last one talking about any type of words hurt bullshit with being  a comedian and having an act that could be deemed offensive to certain people.  It's amazing to me.  I feel like any time we play a clip from The View, it's only a matter of time before it  just becomes voices talking quickly over each other. 
[00:06:00]  By the end of that clip, I had no idea what anybody was saying anymore.  But Whoopi, it's also strange that now there's such an issue with the way people speak racially  in terms of race because Whoopi was dating Ted Danson when Ted Danson got in trouble for  in blackface at the Friars Club, I believe it was.  And Whoopi kind of defended him on that, saying it was comedy. 
[00:06:30]  So it's very strange when you try to figure out what context these things work in.  It's frightening as somebody who speaks publicly.  Ben, in Australia, all the way out in Australia, what's going on?  Sammy, what's up?  How are you?  I'm good, man.  Hey, yesterday the boys were talking about that footy player from Australia that pissed  in his own mouth.  You would have seen the photo, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We showed a photo.  There was a rugby player, I think.  But yeah, he got suspended from the team because photos came out where you could clearly see 
[00:07:00]  him holding his dick, pointing upwards, and pissing into his own mouth for sport.  Yeah, man.  It's become a really big thing here in Australia.  It started a new trend called bubbling, where pretty much all these young kids are taking  photos of themselves where they piss in their own mouths.  It's hilarious.  It's this big thing.  And I'm hoping it takes up in the U.S. as well, of course.  Isn't it amazing what catches on as a trend?  Like, what becomes...  Oh, yeah, I should do that. 
[00:07:30]  That's fucking hot.  I don't think chicks were to do it, that is.  I don't think chicks can point up that way.  Yeah, with a bit of creativity, I guess it could.  But thought I'd drop that little gem to you.  Well, thanks, Ben.  I'm glad everything's going well in Australia.  Thanks, man.  Have a good one.  All right, buddy.  Thanks a lot.  I appreciate it.  I'll talk to you later.  If that's true, I would love...  I'm going to do some searches for Australian news broadcasts. 
[00:08:00]  I want to find out if kids really are pissing in their own mouths.  Because if that's true, Gatorade should be signing that athlete immediately.  Because people will follow whatever he does.  I don't care who's pissing in their own mouth.  I wouldn't do it.  You could see Hulk Hogan himself lifting that Hulkamaniac cock of his and pointing it into his mouth.  I'm not going to piss in my mouth.  I don't care.  You're not going to trick me into doing it.  But we were talking about soccer yesterday a little bit.  Football, as they call it, and the rest of the world. 
[00:08:30]  And the feverish passion that so many people have for World Cup.  Of course, World Cup is going on in Brazil.  And a Canadian newscaster in Toronto was speaking to some soccer fans.  She ran into some Brazilian soccer fans who are in Toronto who had a special passion for the game.  And we listened to the news clip yesterday.  It's track one.  How nervous were you guys watching this game?  I was really nervous. 
[00:09:00]  Fuck her right in the pussy.  Oh, dang it.  We were going back all together.  There was no need for him to say that.  No, because then he's smiling at the camera.  He's being like a virgin.  He's giving the old Hawaiian, you know, hey, how you doing, finger, thumb, pinky thing.  His buddy is burying his face in his hand like I can't fucking believe you.  He said that.  That's a good one.  Everyone did that on the news.  That is a good one.  We've been talking about before.  I think they're going to start because that started as like a fake viral thing. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  And now I think people saw the fake videos.  Right.  And they're just trying to really do it.  Yes.  Yeah, that's based on that.  Do you have the original one?  It was so obvious that it was fake, but everyone sent it around like, go check this guy out.  But this guy did it.  Yeah.  His friends are funny.  That is so funny.  We should get a fucker right in the pussy here in New York.  What do you think?  Who wants to do it for us?  Come on.  Let's get one done.  Uh, yeah. 
[00:10:00]  This guy.  Oh, I don't care if she's 20.  Hell, I'd fuck her.  You can't say you wouldn't fuck her.  Maybe that's what I'll do when they find her.  I'll go and fuck her.  Fuck her right in her pussy.  All right.  Well, we definitely apologize for that.  See that one?  That was good.  It's so fake.  And everyone sent that around like it was real.  But now it's becoming real.  Can we hear that again?  See?  Is it the new one or the...  Yeah, of course the new one.  The guy really says it. 
[00:10:30]  All together, you can tell things are getting a little bit wild here.  Let's go.  Very close call.  I want to bring in some of the fans.  How nervous were you guys watching this game?  I was really nervous.  Fuck her right in the pussy.  Oh, okay.  Disregard that.  And she got a laugh.  She goes, disregard that.  Disregard that.  You can't disregard that.  What are you?  The judge?  You can tell the jury, disregard that.  You can't disregard that.  Well, it's out of the bag. 
[00:11:00]  She does have to say something, though.  She can't just go, great points.  Good points.  Anything else?  Any other holes you'd like to fill, mister?  The guy is so proud of himself.  Dude, he got it right in there.  He's fucking smiling.  Posada knew.  Right.  I can't wait for today's show, because coming off of that, there's a new news clip.  Same station in Toronto.  Same reporter having a live shot invaded yet again while she was at Pride. 
[00:11:30]  I'm not going to tell you exactly what happened, but we will certainly be watching that clip  later on today.  This woman.  This woman.  And by the way, Ant was saying that the friend of the guy who said it on the news, the friend  of the fucker in her pussy guy, was horrified.  He had his hand, you know, his head buried into his hands.  I would be so proud if a friend of mine could pull something like that off on national television. 
[00:12:00]  Speaking of soccer, though, before we move on from that, we got into the passion of sports  fans and the odd cheers that they have.  A lot of soccer fans have weird songs that they sing for teams.  They're all very insulting towards the opposing team, but we found this was one of our favorite  ones.  Let's go to track three.  In the New York Red Bull Stadium, when the goal, the opposing keeper, kicks the ball out.  The whole crowd screams, you suck, asshole.  Yeah.  O'Leary's Gow FC, it looks like, on Twitter, just sent me the video. 
[00:12:30]  Watch this.  All right.  Or listen to this.  All right.  Or listen to this.  Settin' up for it.  Settin' up for the kick.  So he touches the ball, obviously.  You suck, asshole. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, it stinks.  That's just so much fun for everybody, and you know they're going to get rid of all that  shit.  It's a fun little thing to yell.  Just look at all the crap they took out of the NFL, because people were having too much  fun.  Too much fun.  God forbid you have fun at a sporting event.  Well, I don't think that we need these type of chants. 
[00:13:30]  I think there's much better ones that we could be doing.  Oh, really?  Yes.  You got one?  Well, the guy was going to kick the ball.  Yeah.  The A-H word.  Oh, no, no.  How about, we hope your kick is steeped in folly.  I support Jim's chants.  Whatever you can do to get such a large group of people together on the same page, I think  is a positive thing.  Let's go to Snowy in Michigan, here on the pre-show.  Snowy.  Good morning, Samuel.  Good morning. 
[00:14:00]  Why should I surprise you about, first off, the whole people in Toronto, what their mayor  doing, what he's doing?  Why should there be anything any regular people doing that town be surprising?  Yeah, exactly.  Rob Ford.  But, um, going back to the piss-drinking thing, now, Patton Oswalt, in an older album of  his, big reference to a magazine, he claims in the bit is true, called Piss Drinkers Magazine.  Oh, he claims it's a magazine just devoted for people who like drinking piss.  Well, I mean, we know that that's a sexual fetish, because Jim has spoken at length about 
[00:14:30]  drinking piss in the past.  However, I think that this rugby player in Australia might be the first guy to make it  be like, oh, look what you can do for fun.  Like, this is just, like, a goof.  First off, public athlete came out, you know, and actually showed pictures or whatever of  him doing it, though.  Yeah, it is a little bit of a first thing.  It's pretty underground.  Most people don't, you know, famous people ain't gonna piss, you know.  Not anymore.  Not anymore, Snowy.  Now it's mainstream in a big, big way.  Thanks, buddy.  Andrew, in New Jersey.  Hey, Sam. 
[00:15:00]  What's up, buddy?  I was just wondering, did Lady Di get the invite to the 5th of July party at Anthony's house?  I mean, that's...  And if she didn't...  Okay.  That's the question...  No, no, no.  Don't be at all.  That's the question on everybody's mind, isn't it?  Anthony said last week that he did not want Lady Di at the big 5th of July Independence Day  Kumia Bash, however, he's had a week to think about it, and hopefully we'll hear from Lady  Di today to get to the bottom of whether or not she's invited, because, you know, I mean, 
[00:15:30]  I think that she should be, don't you?  Yeah, well, you know, I think Anthony puts out invites, so she might have to get her email  address out there.  Maybe that's what it is.  Maybe she should call up today and let Anthony know what her email is.  Exactly.  Yeah, not a bad idea.  Thank you, Andrew.  Okay.  While we're talking about sports, one of the bleacher creatures from Yankee Stadium called  into the show yesterday.  I had a ball with this one.  Let's go to track four, Sal.  We got a bleacher creature on the line. 
[00:16:00]  Watch out.  Bald Vinny calling from Yankee Stadium.  What's up, Bald Vinny?  Yo, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  At Yankee Stadium.  I don't live there, contrary to popular belief.  Are you a popular bleacher creature?  I wouldn't know.  Hang in there.  Yeah, whatever.  I don't know.  We're all the same thing.  We're just loud, obnoxious assholes.  Oh, look out.  Nice.  So back in the day, you know, in the old stadium, everything used to go.  You used to be able to do or say pretty much anything you wanted. 
[00:16:30]  We would do songs and chants that would make, you know, pretty much everybody embarrassed.  Wait, wait, wait.  Give us an example of one you did at the old stadium, just so we know where we're at today.  The basic one was a song called Horse's Ass.  Very, very simple.  Very easy rhythmic.  My piazza is a horse's ass.  He's the meanest.  He sucks the biggest penis.  My piazza is a horse's ass.  Easy, quick, simple, to the point.  Worked really well. 
[00:17:00]  Now you can't even say the word sucks.  We literally got called to the front office at Yankee Stadium, the director of operations,  and was told that we are not allowed to say box seats suck.  We used to make fun of the guys who sat in the box seats because they would pay like four times the ticket price that we paid to sit in the bleachers.  Right.  It was cool, you know, back in the day.  We were like, you paid 28, we paid 6, we are cool, you are dicks, like dumb stuff like that.  And we were rounded out with box seats suck, and we were told, everybody is there to enjoy the game. 
[00:17:30]  We're all in the fans, and you shouldn't make fun of other fans because of where they choose to sit.  Can we have another rhyme in the piazza moment, Cole?  What's that?  Can we have another rhyme, like another team song?  You like the piazza one?  Yeah, I mean, at least you could say that stuff.  It's really, they're all team-specific stuff.  It was one for the Red Sox.  There has to be a good one for the Red Sox.  Oh, that's, yeah, that's a good one.  Actually, my absolute favorite one, which is completely the most inappropriate thing ever, 
[00:18:00]  was our rewrite of Oak Canada, which was done the weekend that JFK Jr. was killed in a plane crash.  We call it Oak Kennedy.  And it's all about how JFK Jr. couldn't fly.  Well, sing it.  How did it go?  Oh, Kennedy, your plane went down at sea.  Too fucking bad.  You're up there with your dad.  In a flaming wreck, you hit the deck and you died instantly. 
[00:18:30]  Your wife was hot.  Now she's just a spot.  At the bottom of the deep blue sea, you couldn't fly.  That's why you died.  Oh, Kennedy, your plane went down at sea.  Oh, Kennedy, your plane went down at sea. 
[00:19:00]  And the dead air on that explained the loss.  I mean, anything you can't fit on a t-shirt, how could you chant that?  How could any player on the field be offended by that song?  There's no way they could listen to the whole thing.  Anybody who's playing and has enough time to take 30 seconds out of the game  to listen to an entire verse of a song that some fans are chanting 
[00:19:30]  is not playing the game very well.  If you're going to chant, make it quick.  Like the Red Bulls chant, you suck, asshole.  Like that, okay, that I understand.  Message delivered.  These other ones, it's too long.  It's too much to figure out.  It's wordy.  Very wordy.  Well, today on the show, a lot to get to.  We have an update.  Remember a couple weeks ago, we were talking about the story of the kind of unknown rapper 
[00:20:00]  that was at a party and decided to cut his dick off and jump out a window and survived.  Well, we've got an update on him.  He's talking.  He's trying to promote an album now.  Apparently, he's back in the studio.  He's got some rationale for what happened.  Talking a little bit about his dick, too.  We'll get into that audio later on on today's show.  So, of course, now, you know, we're talking about where it's heard, and I said at the  top of the show, there's a school president who's a black female who went on Instagram 
[00:20:30]  and impersonated white men and is now in trouble.  So, it's going the opposite direction as well.  She is, apparently she was asked to step down as president.  We'll get into that story.  Tinder is in trouble for sexual harassment, I guess.  And, and, a whole lot more.  First, there's a little bit left to get into as far as what happened on yesterday's Opie  and Anthony show.  We got a visit from the one and only consumer.  Which, by the way, as you listened to earlier here in the pre-show, Opie wants somebody to 
[00:21:00]  do a fucker in her pussy here in New York.  I feel like the hawk is the one to pull that off.  But that aside, the consumer, another one of the alter egos of Mr. E-Rock, he,  he, it's weird what's happened with E-Rock because he's branded this thing the consumer.  And instead of being made fun of for eating snacks, which is what has happened for the  last, you know, eight, nine years, he's branded it and Opie and Anthony have embraced it. 
[00:21:30]  It's really, it's an amazing thing to watch happen because now they're all very interested  in his opinions on beer and snacks.  Uh, he got into a chocolate beer that he sampled over the weekend yesterday.  It's chocolate peanut butter porter.  What the fuck?  Would you drink that?  No!  Oh, it's a drink, it's not an actual spread?  No, it's a beer.  I don't like peanut butter.  I hate peanut butter.  And the thought of a beer that tastes like peanut butter is repulsive. 
[00:22:00]  What does it taste like?  It tastes like a dark chocolate peanut butter cup.  Can you taste the alcohol?  Not really, no, but it is 6.5% volume.  You can only have maybe a half of one of those.  Right?  To get doodied?  Fuck yeah.  You'd start like woofing.  How many did you have?  I had one.  It's hard.  It's very heavy.  Yeah, you can't.  Who's fucking doing that?  Matching on a hot, well, we got 4th of July, right?  Yeah, yeah.  4th of July.  Drinking Sweet Baby Jesus? 
[00:22:30]  You're out in the sun just drinking this chocolatey syrup.  Yeah.  That would be a miserable experience.  Peanut buttery booze.  On the beach.  Hey, get me another Sweet Baby Jesus.  Yeah, you got another one?  Well, there weren't any in the cooler, so they're a little warm.  All right.  Oh, God damn.  You stand up in your Willy Wonka chocolate factory down the back of both your legs.  No shit.  You must just spray.  It's got to be horrendous.  That's got to be it.  That is the rumor.  That's a winter beer. 
[00:23:00]  That's a winter ale or whatever, a port or whatever the fuck it is.  That's got to be like a fucking golf course sprinkler out of your ass.  I came up with something new with it because it's so heavy.  You poured it into a glass, and then you put a little whipped cream on top.  Of course.  You just always need more, do you?  And I'm going to try putting it into some brownie mix and see how that goes.  What are you doing?  Are you doing a shot of old granddad fucking a little gelato? 
[00:23:30]  That E-Rock always needs just a little more.  Good way to, yeah, just sweeten it up a little, spice it up.  It's never good enough, is it?  No, no.  Here's some Everclear and Cheos.  It could always be better.  Your motto is, it could always be better.  It could always be better.  You know, I think later this summer, we're going to be airing the best of the year so far,  and I believe it was this year, if I'm not mistaken, that E-Rock took part in a weight loss challenge  sponsored by Dr. Ian Smith. 
[00:24:00]  My, how the tides have turned as he discusses adding whipped cream to his chocolate beer.  However, this is what I like about E-Rock.  He's passionate about what he believes in, and there is room for the consumer to grow.  They didn't pick up on this, but when Anthony was talking about the spray that may come out  of your backside based on that beer, E-Rock said that's the rumor, which I believe is his  way of telling the room.  He did indeed spray all over his toilet, and I think part of the consumer, it should be 
[00:24:30]  one of those things.  You know how on Instagram, you can take two photos and split screen them so you can have  one photo on top and one photo on the bottom.  It should be a before and after.  So the top photo is a photo of the product he's reviewing.  The bottom photo is what the toilet looks like after you're done eating that product.  I think that's where the consumer needs to go, because we need to paint a full picture  of what's going on.  Just some food for thought.  No pun intended.  But E-Rock got into a big argument with a beer aficionado who called in later on in 
[00:25:00]  the show.  E-Rock, have you tried the watermelon beer?  Yes.  I did a review, and I've been recommending it for a long time.  I had one over the weekend.  Watermelon beer.  The 21st Amendment in San Francisco.  That's the exact can I had over the weekend.  I fucking hated it.  You don't like the watermelon beer?  I don't like watermelon.  I don't either.  I'm a big fan of the watermelon.  I like a couple of tastes.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, delicious. 
[00:25:30]  I'm done with this crap.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I go very hot and cold with watermelon.  I'm not a fan of watermelon.  I'm doing a whole podcast on it.  Although, watermelon with a little feta cheese ain't...  What?  Try it.  Cheese and watermelon, now you're talking crazy.  That's not too bad.  Putting those two things together.  E-Rock, 21st Amendment's got so many other beers.  Why did you pick the watermelon beer?  Because it was fucking available, you douchebag.  Whoa!  This is a guy that...  Look, I'm sure he drinks beer for many years and knows what he's talking about. 
[00:26:00]  But if it's not exactly what he likes, everything sucks.  I put it out there saying, I enjoy it.  You should try it for yourself and see.  Wow.  Not that this is the best beer ever and everything else sucks.  There's so many better ones.  I hate that.  When people are just like, try it for yourself.  I don't personally like it or I do like it.  I'm with Don on the watermelon beer.  I hated it.  I really did.  At least you tried it.  Is this a good beer before or after a bag of treats?  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck, E-Rock.  It's a good beer to spit in your face, you snob. 
[00:26:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Drinking your growler with your pinky in your air, you asshole.  Oh!  Pinky in your air.  How is your pinky in your air?  What?  You need to look a toe to cleanse your palate after you drink that beer.  It was so nasty.  Swish it around in your mouth.  Feel every hop.  You don't like the beer snobs, E-Rock?  No.  They are the worst.  You get beer snobs who are people who just like, as they call it, you know, your corporate 
[00:27:00]  beers, Budweiser and whatnot.  And then you get your beer snobs on the other end who are so far into the craft beer world  that if it's not specifically tailored to, you know, like hops from this region or brewed  this way, that everything in between fucking sucks.  So you've got to find a balance in the middle where you'll drink a Coors and then you'll drink  something from one of these independent brewers.  I'm not a fan of, like, the basic beers like your Miller, your Budweiser, your Coors. 
[00:27:30]  Moe?  Moe?  You know, I'm not a fan of any of that shit.  Moe loves Miller?  Danny.  He buys that new black label Miller.  Just drink in the closet alone.  I do have a butt.  Yeah.  But I tried that.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Jesus.  You just can't be left hanging out there like that.  That's for sure.  It's nice to see E-Rock finally have some passion about something.  It's about time. 
[00:28:00]  I don't understand the flavored beer thing myself.  I mean, I'm not a beer drinker, but I would think if you want beer, you just drink beer.  However, I respect that E-Rock treats beer like most children treat Apple Jacks.  We eat what we like.  No reason to explain it.  But it doesn't taste like apples.  So what, you fuck face?  You fucking cereal snob.  I love it.  I absolutely love it.  And then E-Rock broke down the beer thing even more, poorly explaining what IPA is yesterday. 
[00:28:30]  Kill him.  What's a better beer than this guy said that you should have liked from that?  Well, it doesn't matter, because if you talk to anybody who doesn't...  Oh, well, I like that watermelon beer from the first amendment.  It's actually really good for the summer.  I hear this pretentious name of a beer that he's going to bring up for.  Yeah, go ahead, Don.  What's better than the watermelon beer from that company?  They've got a black IPA, and then there's a, let's see, they've got the Live Fury or Die's got the, they've got an IPA that's good. 
[00:29:00]  So, I mean, it was just of all the beers I've got.  I've got to go to that.  When you go to a bar and they go, oh, we've got a good IPA on draft, do you get excited?  I hate it.  And then they force you to get it, you get it, and it's like, ew, this doesn't taste like what I'm used to.  I just want a cold bud.  Just give me a cold bud at the bar, I'm fine.  Just want to let you know we have some good IPAs.  I'm not there to have a drink, a fucking taste experience.  I have dinner. 
[00:29:30]  I'm there to fucking just drink cold beer until I fall down.  You know, our IPAs are outstanding.  We have a good IPA today.  Like, their beer changes every day, like that fucking matters.  They do, sometimes they do.  God, beer snobs, can't stand them.  What's an IPA?  Indian pale ale.  Indian, a different style of beer.  There's some good beginner ones out there, like the Sam Adams.  See, a beginner.  What's a beginner IPA?  I need a beginner IPA.  It's a bottle with training wheels. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  I've got to train my taste buds before I get to the real IPAs.  I'm not good enough to judge if this is good or not.  So, only take one training wheel off my bicycle.  Dad.  Oh, don't drink too much.  And then let's talk about it for 20 minutes.  This is why I stick to Dr. Pepper.  Only one argument to have.  What are you, Dr. Pepper or Mr. Pibb?  Well, I like to sample the flavors of both.  I find Pibb to be a little sweeter.  A lot going on today on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:30:30]  Don't tell Jim, but I believe Roland has some food coming in today.  I think he may have that planned.  That remains to be seen.  However, what I can tell you is a lot of stories to get to.  Of course, the black school president who was asked to step down because she was imitating  a white male.  Another newscast interrupted by the same lady who was attacked by Mr. Fucker and her pussy.  And an update from the rapper that cut off his penis. 
[00:31:00]  All that and more.  Good news.  The Opie and Anthony show is where it happens.  And that starts right now.  The Opie and Anthony show is where it happens. 
[00:31:30]  Thank you. 
[00:32:00]  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  A new hope begins to rise.  Opie and Anthony are radio shock jocks known for setting up outrageous stunts.  People sure are listening.  Two Long Island natives who together would one day change the world as broadcasting's  greatest duo.  Opie!  Opie and Anthony!  Opie!  Opie!  Opie!  Yeah! 
[00:35:00]  Oh my God!  This is beautiful!  After 20 years, these children of the 80s have arrived.  Their hugely popular radio show is a very popular radio show is not just in New York anymore.  Opie and Anthony show is a very popular radio show.  Opie and Anthony show is a very popular radio show.  Through 55-gallon drums and wiffled ball bats.  You push it in until you're comfortable.  From mayors to mayor.  It was an April Fool's pulse by two radio disc jockeys.  Bottle rockets and bra bombings.  And wieners and pigs.  Opie and Anthony got their hands on the photo and tweeted it. 
[00:35:30]  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any.  Well, these people will definitely stop. Guaranteed.  Lift up the cocks.  They've met friends along the way.  Jim Norton.  I have a raging hard-on right now.  Can I please put my dick in your donuts?  And through fines, scandals, suspensions, cancellations, and terminations,  it's the one show that remains unscathed. 
[00:36:00]  Striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere  comes a radio show that after 20 years remains above all else.  Real.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's do that.  It's showtime.  Hello.  It's also soccer day.  Oh, the big Belgium game. 
[00:36:30]  When's the big game?  Noon?  Four?  Does the U.S. play today?  Yeah.  The U.S. plays Belgium.  And this ain't any more of this who wins this or who wins that bullshit.  Like, you lose, you're out, right?  Yeah, lose, you're going home.  That's pretty much it now.  That's it.  You go home now.  You go home.  How's Belgium, huh?  Belgium's a tough team, Anthony.  Well, not against Germany.  Tough team.  I mean the war.  I see.  He blitzkrieged his way right over there, asses.  18 days, was it? 
[00:37:00]  That's why soccer's so great.  It's just wars.  Yeah, yeah.  Just look at it as countries fighting wars.  Countries still holding a grudge.  Against each other.  I really, uh, I'm really enjoying the World Cup.  I sort of get this soccer thing now.  It's a big deal.  Everyone's making a very big deal.  I don't know.  How do you make it cool all year round, though, is the question.  Yeah.  Because I also dug a bit of that curling. 
[00:37:30]  Remember when we were into the curling thing?  When you understood the strategy behind that, you're like,  well, I think I could watch this.  You haven't been keeping tabs on curling?  God, no.  Over, uh, since the Olympics?  And I'm not trying to compare soccer to curling, certainly,  but just that feeling you get, like,  you know what, I'm kind of getting into this thing.  Closing ceremonies at the Winter Olympics.  Goodbye.  That's pretty much adios to curling.  Oh, boy, was it.  Who gives a shite?  So long.  Yeah.  So now, uh, yeah, they play Belgium, huh? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, but then I asked about the soccer thing on Twitter,  and everyone's suggesting a different league,  and I'm thinking to myself, that's the problem.  Stop it.  I don't know.  There should be some kind of world league.  There should just be the league.  Like a world league that everyone has agreed,  this is the league we need.  You see how American football works,  and then they try to shovel in these other football things on you?  Yeah.  You've got to try the Canadian rules football.  Australian rules football.  Australian rules football.  It's very good.  You should keep tabs on.  No.  Have you ever watched the CFL? 
[00:38:30]  The field is just ridiculously long and wide.  It doesn't look right.  And their uniforms almost look like NFL teams.  Almost.  Almost.  Look how big this stupid field is.  How many yards is that?  I don't know.  They didn't have that much.  It's a regular-sized field.  It's just the goalposts, you know.  No, I thought they were wider or something.  No, man.  That was curved.  Fish-eyed lens. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Maybe it is longer.  It is longer, I'm telling you.  And I think a bit wider.  Is that the dimensions on the right  showing you the difference between the NFL?  Well, so they go, what the, is it, it's what, 80 yards wider or something?  That's crazy.  I wasn't prepared.  It's all right.  It doesn't matter.  It's 30 miles long.  It is, right?  I watch some CFL when I'm up in Canada.  Do you?  Do you really?  Why not?  You've really, you've become this very pussy-whipped Canadian. 
[00:39:30]  No, I search for things to watch up there because there's not a lot of quality.  You don't like their music video channel where they only play Canadian artists?  Come on.  No.  Rush again?  Yeah.  They have rules up there.  Or they used to have rules.  Yeah.  Where, you know, a percentage of what you played on the radio had to be Canadian artists.  Had to be Canadian.  Same with the movies.  I think you have to have a certain amount of Canadian, like.  Jesus.  Why don't we just play whatever the, whatever is the best?  A lot of SCTV.  Yeah.  What is it?  The Juno Awards? 
[00:40:00]  The Juno Awards.  What?  Some Jews are smart, but there's no reason to label the award that way.  Oh, baseball-sized hail.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  I love when they describe hail like that.  Yeah.  I actually like playing ball with hail-sized baseballs.  Hail-sized baseballs.  Nice.  But it's never, it's never the size of the item they tell you it is.  No, it never is.  Then the video hits and you're like, that's more like a golf ball.  That's a golf ball.  I'm sure it did some damage. 
[00:40:30]  It was very terrible and it was very exciting, but stop with the soft ball.  Yeah.  That's a big chunk of fucking hail.  News reports from yesterday's fucker in the pussy story gets interrupted by topless woman  while reporting from Pride.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Good morning, Sam Roberts.  There he is.  What happened to Travis?  We were having a nice conversation with him.  Why'd you come in and muscle Travis out?  You really did.  We were in the middle of a conversation with Travis.  Tell him to scram, didn't you?  Wow.  He got scared.  What an alpha male douche. 
[00:41:00]  I know.  And that's not hard to do on Travis.  I know.  Tucked his little tail between his legs and...  Tucked his little manx cat penis.  Wimpered out of here.  Yeah.  We were enjoying our discussion about Canada.  He ran out.  He did run out.  I don't know what happened.  I miss him already.  Hey, real quick with Sam Roberts, before I forget.  I was watching this guy and this other guy and they're reviewing this 4D movie theater thing.  Have you seen this?  It's from California.  They were from L.A.  And they're talking about this 4D movies, which kind of the seat moves and rumbles and they throw water in your face and there's wind. 
[00:41:30]  I know.  They're trying to make a thing of it.  Why would you want that?  So I was just watching the review.  Yeah.  And this fucking guy is wearing this fucking Not Sam shirt.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  I'm like...  And so I check his Twitter and everything.  There's really no connection.  He's not...  It's not like, you know, hey, oh, an A fan or Sam fan.  There's just nothing.  Nice.  He was just wearing the shirt.  I'm like, this guy decided to wear a Not Sam shirt as he's doing a review on a thing online? 
[00:42:00]  You saw it, Travis?  Are you back?  You know who that is?  What happened to you in the middle of our conversation?  Sam came in.  I didn't know we were in the middle of a conversation.  I felt like we were still talking about Canada.  I really...  Jimmy made a joke about the Juno Awards, but we were going to continue.  Okay.  We were going to continue about other things you watch and see in Canada when you go up there.  And then cancer comes in and the healthy cells leave.  It was Jermaine from Slash Film.  Oh, nice.  Jermaine from what?  Slash Film. 
[00:42:30]  I don't know what that is.  It's a great, like...  It's a giant film website where guys with great taste review things.  I've got to tell you, I was watching the review and he came off a little unprepared.  No.  It kind of was a shitty review.  Oh, he's got a weirdo.  I was a shitty review.  Was it?  I was like, ah, you know.  But they throw shit in your face while you're trying to watch a movie?  Yes.  Oh, I don't want that.  One part of their review was kind of...  They were watching Transformers. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  And they said the movie's like two and a half hours long.  It's 240.  It goes, after an hour and a half, you've kind of been hit with all the shit that they're  going to hit you with.  And now it's kind of just distracting.  You're watching the movie and like, oh, what now?  Like, you watch the movie and go, uh-oh, I see some rain coming up.  I know they're going to splash me in the face and some shit.  There is the Not Sam shirt.  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  Looks like a good review.  Are they hipsters?  They are nerdy, geeky dudes. 
[00:43:30]  Man, they are real nerds.  They're chubsters.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Trying to pull off the hipster.  Look, they might want to drop a few pounds.  You've got to be a little more weight-like if you want to be a hipster, right?  They come out.  That's before they went in.  But then they come out and they're like, oh, and they're kind of talking over each other.  I don't know.  After an hour and a half, it was kind of weird knowing what was going to happen.  And it was a little distracting for the movie.  You don't think it was a well-thought-out review? 
[00:44:00]  Could have been better.  They look like guys on a certain registry.  Yeah, no kidding.  No kidding.  What does 4DX mean?  What does that mean?  It's the new movie theaters.  They're 4DX theaters.  But who has to clean up all that crap?  Yeah, I was thinking that, too.  They're trying to compete with IMAX.  And IMAX 3D is amazing and it's huge.  So they decided, oh, let's get seats that kind of rumble.  Right.  And then they also tilt a little bit one way or the other, but slowly. 
[00:44:30]  That would be fun.  That I wouldn't mind.  And then there's additional lighting in the place.  So if there's an explosion, it might really, like, flash on the side of your head and your peripheral vision or something like that.  So they're trying to really immerse you in the movie.  And you said if it rains, they'll actually...  Yeah, there's some water that hits you.  Really?  Even so much as, you know, a big truck goes through a puddle and it kind of goes toward the camera.  Like, they'll nail you with that.  They'll miss it.  Yeah.  So if you go there to watch, like, the latest Adam Sandler movie, do they just shove dog shit in your face for two hours? 
[00:45:00]  I guess.  Imagine how you just...  I'm just smelling shit the whole time.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was...  I don't know.  I like the moving seats and stuff like that, but...  In certain movies.  When they spray a little shit on you.  Yeah.  Like a little lemon spray or something.  It's like the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids movie at Disney World.  Well, that was pretty goddamn good. 
[00:45:30]  Right.  I like that one.  You see that fucking when the mice came out?  Right.  And then there's a little thing, like a weed whacker kind of a thing, under your seat.  And it turns and hits your ankles.  And you just hear the crowd go, wah!  They start screaming because you see the mice coming off the screen.  Right.  And then they touch your feet.  Really?  It's a lot of fun.  Yeah, but that's cool for a three-minute ride.  Yeah.  Not a three-hour movie.  That's just it.  And it really does limit the movies that they're able to play in these theaters, because what  are you going to go see?  A rom-com?  Oh, look. 
[00:46:00]  Fucking, oh, it smells like perfume and lipstick.  Yeah.  How many movies actually come out where that would matter, that technology?  Yeah.  And then your popcorn's getting wet.  You're like, ooh.  Stop making it rain.  Right?  Where the fuck?  I want to enjoy my popcorn, you assholes.  Yeah, you don't go to see Noah in that theater.  This guy wants to talk about the movie theater.  Does he?  I guess he's seen it or been there.  What do you got on this, Drew?  Yeah, they're trying to compare it to, like, fucking Disney and all that kind of bullshit, 
[00:46:30]  like, where your fucking seat shakes, and they fucking put, like, one of those rubber  things under the bottom where your feet are.  No.  Same thing.  Yeah, we just said...  No, Drew, Drew, when we go to you, you've got to add to the conversation.  I'm just...  Just summarizing.  He's reiterating.  Yeah.  Yeah, they call it 4-D.  We're not fucking teachers here where you're like, oh, okay, I'm ready for the pop quiz  now.  No, I'm just trying to add to your conversation.  But what could you add? 
[00:47:00]  Oh, God, he's so mad now.  What the fuck?  He's mad now.  Relax, Jersey.  Remember, stronger than the storm.  Relax.  Right?  We're going to get through this.  You never get mad.  I blew it.  Right.  I honestly thought you actually went to one of these theaters.  That's what I'm looking for today.  Maybe someone that has actually seen a movie.  Where are they?  No, maybe not.  All right.  Thanks, Drew.  It was in L.A.  They got a couple of hundred of them, I guess, out.  This is the first one.  Oh, in the States.  In the States, yeah. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, in Los Angeles.  Yes.  Oh, there's none here.  There's one in Los Angeles.  No, they're really going to...  How long is this review?  It's only a minute.  Oh, okay.  Well, this, that's...  No, this is the review before the review.  Yeah.  This is them talking, but then the review is actually down a little further.  Oh, I went to the page.  It's like the pre-show.  Yeah, you go down, and then there's another video.  That's their review.  How long is it?  This one's eight and a half minutes.  Oh, that's nice.  You can't do it.  You can get a taste of their rapport, I think. 
[00:48:00]  Still looks good, though.  I mean, aesthetically.  Yeah, the not Sam shirt is really distracting, quite frankly.  Yeah.  Just say C, under it.  Oh, they do the 4D thing in Hershey, Pennsylvania.  You know, the place where they don't make the chocolate anymore.  Oh, right.  Well.  You want to talk to Josh?  I want someone that has been to the theater, though.  Josh.  Yeah.  We go to Hershey every year.  Yeah, okay.  And you've been to the theater?  Yeah, you sit in there, and they tell you the history of the park and the history of 
[00:48:30]  the whole factory and everything, and they pump chocolate smell into the back thing when  you drive, when it shows that you're driving through the town, the seats rumble, when they  have a mouse or a rat that's trying to hit your foot, and then they spray water.  Enough about the mouse and rat on your foot.  Tell us what happens if you saw Willard in 4DX Go.  The guy's talking about Hershey.  Right.  Like, like, that's not the 4D theater.  That's a Hershey exclusive, like, theater like they have at Disney for Honey, I Shrunk 
[00:49:00]  the Kids.  So we still don't have a guy that's been to the theater.  No, you're talking about a whole different thing.  All right.  Is there a chocolate choo-choo train at Hershey?  And to start it, I would assume, you press the button, and then you pull the chain.  Wow.  Yeah, that's where it would come out.  Yeah, yeah, and then out comes the, you know.  You think they make lemonade in Hershey, Pennsylvania?  Well, you know what?  You've got to wash down that chocolate somehow.  You could either have milk, milk, lemonade.  Right.  Or you could just go around the back, because that's apparently where the fudge is made. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, I see.  Yes, yeah.  Wait a minute.  I love a good fudge.  Oh, who doesn't?  Do you like fudge?  Love it.  With walnuts?  Right to my thighs.  I have to go.  God, no, walnuts.  I don't mind a nut in some fudge.  I was having a great fantasy of fudge.  Yeah, but they always have to throw something into their fudge.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I like doing, throwing something into the old fudge. 
[00:50:00]  Yes, and then kicking it out of your neighborhood.  Another person that has a 4D theater, but it looks like they haven't been in it either.  Oh, of course.  Look, I want to make this announcement again.  We're looking for someone that has gone through the 4D experience.  Yeah.  Please.  We don't need to know where you got one in your town.  He's calling in.  Huh?  Jermaine's calling in.  Why?  Because you want to talk to somebody who went to the movie.  Well, that's true.  He's going to review it. 
[00:50:30]  The one with the not Sam shirt?  Yeah, the cool one.  Who's calling in?  The cool one.  This guy right here.  He's going to review his t-shirt collection.  His name's Jermaine.  To what subject?  The goddamn German's got nothing to do with it.  Fuck.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  You wanted someone who's seen the movie theater?  Christ.  I produced.  He's in L.A.  That's great.  Yeah, I woke him up. 
[00:51:00]  Hey, is this really Jermaine?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, O?  Holy shit.  It's Jermaine live on the O.P. and Anthony show.  How'd you get your not Sam shirt?  I ordered it from notsam.com.  Oh, shit.  Dump out of that.  Please dump out of that.  Too late.  Cut that out of the replay.  Are you a fan of our show?  You must be.  Yeah.  I've been listening since, like, 2000, maybe.  Jesus.  That's going back a ways. 
[00:51:30]  Thank God.  So, Anthony found your review online and thought it was terrific, so we figured we'd give you  a call.  I saw the not Sam shirt, and I was like, whoa.  I've got to stop and see what this 4DX is all about.  It's my favorite segment of all time.  Oh, I bet it is.  You're counting the money in your head, right?  Yes, I am.  Jesus.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah, I was watching it.  I actually wore it just because I was like, oh, you know what?  I was going through my teacher drawer, and I'm like, oh, I'll wear this for Sam today.  I've been shooting this thing.  Laundry day. 
[00:52:00]  I call that laundry day.  A lot of GTA.  A lot of GTA shirts show up on laundry day.  Things like that.  Shirts that you're like, ah, boy, I haven't worn this one.  I'm just sitting around the house.  Right.  I really don't want to go out with this shirt on, but, yeah, but you decided to just let  your freak flag fly.  And put your Not Sam shirt on for the big review.  And they gave us three 4DX shirts when we walked out, because it's the first one in the country,  so they're really promoting it. 
[00:52:30]  You defied them and didn't put it on.  Exactly.  I was like, hey, for the best part of the review, I've got to leave my Not Sam shirt.  Yes, yes, there it is.  Great guy.  It's a good review.  Now, you went, I saw the review.  You went to the 4DX theater to go see Transformers movies, the Transformers movie with Marky Mark.  Marky Mark's in there.  Marky Mark's in there?  Yeah.  He's in the new one.  And you said the movie's too long for the effect, right? 
[00:53:00]  Oh, way too long.  Once you get about an hour 20 in it, you've seen everything it can do.  Oh, man.  I get it.  I get it.  It shakes.  I get it.  I'm going to get water.  I get it.  I'm going to do bullets by my head.  And then it just becomes...  Do they actually shoot bullets by the head?  That would be cool.  400 Mark's behind the screen shooting at the audience.  Can you imagine?  What happens when there's mice on the screen?  Enough about the mice. 
[00:53:30]  Goddamn mice.  How much water do they throw at you?  It's not a lot.  You know, there's a mist effect for sort of like rainforest-y things,  and then they do shoot like a thing of water up from the seat in front of you  out onto your face.  I had to wipe off my glasses at one point.  Naughty nurses like Pee Wee did.  Yeah.  See what happens.  It's a great porno theater experience.  Oh, God.  We're getting hit with hand motion.  All the water jets with meringue. 
[00:54:00]  So you go in there, and it's spent.  After an hour 20, now it's just you're looking at the screen going,  uh-oh, I see some rain.  I know this is going to be an issue.  They're going to douse me again.  Yeah.  You never...  And it just becomes like a third thing you're thinking about in the movie.  You know, you think about the story,  thinking about, you know, whatever else, mysteries are going on.  And then you're like, well, what the hell is this thing going to throw at me? 
[00:54:30]  Distracting.  Yeah.  It's hard.  I mean, luckily I've already seen the movie,  so I didn't really have to think about, like, what was happening next.  Yeah.  It was just like, it was like, oh, action scene you've expected.  You expect to be thrown this way and that way.  Yeah.  But if you, uh, you know, then you're just driving in a car,  and it's, like, shaking you, and you're like,  I don't want to feel that.  Like, it never knows if you want to be a good guy or a bad guy.  You're just everybody in the entire movie.  What, what, what's the one thing where you went,  what the fuck, enough already. 
[00:55:00]  Uh, I think it's, there's a scene in the movie where, like,  this, like, lizard, like, wraps around the girl's legs,  and something, like, comes out from under your seat.  Oh, no.  Enough about the under the seat.  Really?  Yeah, they do that in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, apparently.  You know, when the mice come off the screen.  Oh, I heard that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, they run down the audience,  and they have this little thing under the seat,  and it hits your ankles, and everybody screams.  I saw The Godfather in one of these.  When they're in Louie's in the Bronx,  like, marinara sauce comes out and lists on everybody. 
[00:55:30]  How great would that be?  Just spray the audience with hot.  Someone takes piano wire, rats around your neck,  the Luca Brasi scene.  This hot red sauce on his face.  Wow.  So, uh, you do a lot of these reviews?  Uh, yeah, I mean, not 4DX reviews, but, uh.  Movies?  Movies, news, yeah.  I call into Ron and Fizz all the time as a G-Babe.  Oh, oh, okay. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, you're that guy.  I'm that guy.  Nice.  Because I was watching this, I was watching this review.  I don't get to watch many of your reviews.  And, uh, I will now.  But it seemed like you guys were really, um,  kind of, um, uh, talking over each other a little bit on this one.  You were both very excited.  Well, you know, we were charted on an iPhone, you know.  It wasn't, like, the most super professional thing.  Most of the time I'm writing.  That's iPhone video, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Those iPhones are amazing.  All right. 
[00:56:30]  The S5's better, though.  Let's relax.  Oh, you know what?  Why don't you do a review on that?  S5 versus, uh, Apple as far as video goes.  You do reach a point.  Although the red in the Not Sam shirt is a little subdued in that.  I think the saturation needs to be turned up a little bit.  I'll have to wear a Virus Tour 2008 shirt next time.  Oh, a Slobo shirt.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, my God.  I've got a fucking Slobo shirt on there.  You're perfect for one of those.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  I thought the colors of the shirt, you know, will bring out your eyes a little bit. 
[00:57:00]  You guys have woken up before the sun comes up to be insulted like this.  Yeah, but you know how many people are going to check you out now, sir?  That is true.  You want to give out your, uh, your website there?  Give a little plug?  Sure.  Yeah, uh, flashfilm.com, and I'm on Twitter at at your main sphere.  Nice.  Yeah, I thought it was pretty cool.  Somebody, um, posted a link on Twitter and said,  Anthony, check out the review for this new theater shit.  And I turned it on.  I'm like, who the fuck is that with the Not Sam shirt?  I was angered by that. 
[00:57:30]  You couldn't really get past the shirt.  But then I watched the review, and it was kind of fun.  You guys are kind of fun and goofy when you're doing your reviews.  I liked it.  It shouldn't make you angry.  It's not going to be angry.  It's going to be like, oh, cool.  Sam, I'm always angry.  All right, Jermaine.  All right, Jermaine.  Have a good rest of your morning.  Yeah, good talking.  I'll go back to sleep.  Yeah, do that.  All right.  All right, see that?  There it is.  Big reviewer right there, Jermaine.  It's not Sam shirt.  Yeah, it just seems kind of tedious, that whole 4D thing. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know if it's going to take off like IMAX.  I think it might be for the kids.  For the kids?  Bring the kids.  Like I said, just such a limited movies.  You could see with it.  What are you going to do?  Maybe you could.  Go to Rochelle Rochelle.  You'll see that.  Nothing's going to happen.  Sack Lunch?  Maybe you could go see.  That's it.  Yes.  Of course.  How much do tickets cost for it?  20-something bucks. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, because IMAX tickets are already expensive.  Yeah, it's like you're not just paying a movie.  IMAX is expensive.  It's so worth every dollar.  It's so fucking worth it.  I don't even notice.  Well, yeah, you don't notice, but I do.  It's expensive.  I don't even notice.  It's like unless the tickets were $100,000 each, you'd start perking up.  But Sam is extremely fucking cheap.  He is thrifty.  Even when I had no money, I knew when to spend it properly and go, wow, you know what?  I'm going to treat myself to something nice.  He went back and forth to Boston this weekend. 
[00:59:00]  It's like Mick Foley.  He didn't want to stay in a hotel.  Like Mick Foley.  Why would you stay in a hotel in Boston and enjoy it a little bit?  Three hours from home.  Take out a nap.  So he goes there.  Free bed there.  Oh, God.  What a cheapo.  He drives three hours with his wife for a little family function.  Stays there for how many hours?  Three, four hours?  Yeah.  We were there for about four hours.  And then drives three hours back instead of maybe camping out in a hotel and maybe get  a nice little brunch happening the next day before you drive back home. 
[00:59:30]  Can't do that anymore.  Where'd you go?  Fucking amazing.  Boston.  And you rode back the same day?  Yeah.  That's awful.  Ah, terrible.  Three hours.  There's only three hours.  Yeah, but you're definitely starting to make some money.  You're making enough money to get a halfway decent hotel for the night and relax and enjoy  yourself.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm trying to keep that money.  Yeah, but you buy wrestling stuff.  Yeah, but I don't buy...  Because he doesn't stay in hotels.  Right.  You've got to cut corners somewhere.  Yeah, you've got to...  It'll be the comfort of you and your loved one.  A hot wife. 
[01:00:00]  You've got to take her out.  How miserable was the three-hour ride back after driving three hours and staying there  four hours?  It was very pleasant.  No, it wasn't.  It can't be.  I drove back with my wife.  We enjoy each other's company.  Play punch buggy?  What's that?  Old.  What's that?  It's old.  Plus, I don't spend hotel money on wrestling stuff.  I get a lot of it for free.  Whoa!  Oh, I think there's some people probably want to know about that free stuff you get.  Absolutely. 
[01:00:30]  A little mention?  Is that what you know?  Hey, relax.  Nothing wrong with an envelope.  Thank you.  What happened?  Sergeant Slaughter come out last night or something?  No.  It was...  Don't care.  Right.  Thank you.  Thank you very much on that.  Save it for the old not-Sam shirt crowd.  Wait, someone came out?  No, please.  No, it's some guy that's the new, you know, fucking American hero, I guess, right?  Is that what you're looking at?  I don't know. 
[01:01:00]  Now Sam won't talk to me.  No.  You know what I mean to say?  Shut up.  I don't care.  No.  It doesn't matter.  Anyway, 4D theaters.  I'm curious.  See the Rockstar movie coming out?  Hercules.  Hercules.  Here's another movie.  Looks pretty badass.  I max Hercules.  Yeah.  Here's another movie coming out?  Jesus.  I guess we were wrong about him when we said we would be...  We would be bigger than him.  Yeah, that's probably the wrong thing to say of the Rock.  The Rock is...  We might have lost that one.  It's huge.  Although we have no issues with the Rock.  That was a long time ago. 
[01:01:30]  Rock.  We love the Rock.  He still calls our show, right?  He calls us every third movie.  Jesus.  The one that really needs some help.  He calls you for the Tooth Fairy.  Yeah, yeah.  Was that the last time?  No, but those are the titles.  I don't think he needs help with Hercules.  That one looks pretty fucking righteous.  I want to go see that one on the 4DX.  No, you don't.  Little rocks come out.  I want to see a legal drama.  A legal drama?  It's like you're smelling yellow notepads. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, a little flecks of paper.  Sharpies.  Yeah.  It's the smell of Sharpies.  It just does seem very limited as to what you can play there.  I think it's perfect for kids.  They'll love that shit.  Nice little Pixar movie, Disney movie type thing.  Maybe you go see Frozen in a 4DX experience and freeze the whole audience.  Stop singing that fucking song.  That's a hell of an investment to make to just play kid movies. 
[01:02:30]  You know?  Anyone else hear Let It Go wherever you go?  I know.  You do, right?  I'm sure he likes Pearl Jam.  I've seen it hundreds of times.  No, but I don't hear it.  I've never heard it.  No, because you're not around people.  I know.  That's a lot of people.  There was a point.  When you walk around Manhattan, it's almost a guarantee you're going to walk by a kid that  is singing Let It Go on the movie.  Yes.  They were singing it in my daughter's school.  It's everywhere.  See, but I'm not in those areas.  No, you're not.  But when you watch the movie, like, at least 50 times.  You don't want anyone to know you're in those areas. 
[01:03:00]  You're in a van near those areas.  Right.  Across the street in a...  With a Cialis rod and binoculars.  A makeshift ice cream truck.  Go online.  Everyone's singing Let It Go.  The parents are now doing parody songs about it.  I know the phenomenon is out there.  Can we give the guys one parody song for Let It Go?  It's usually the father in the front seat filming himself singing Let It Go, but changing 
[01:03:30]  the words.  There was a good month where I would wake up and it would automatically be in my head.  And it would stay in my head all day.  We're still watching it at least one time, once a day.  Really?  Wow.  It's at least...  Holy shit.  How do you do that?  It's on a...  Well, thank God.  I got like four or five, I don't know, four, maybe five.  Five TVs, I think.  So it's on one of them.  Wow.  You have five TVs?  No, he's joking.  No one has five TVs.  One, two, three, four.  I'd love that in my house. 
[01:04:00]  I got five.  Oh, televisions.  Oh.  See, that's...  I just have two.  That's it, huh?  Yeah, they're side by side.  I like to play on different programs.  Oh, God.  Is there any good Let It Go?  I mean, none of them are really good.  Oh, that's...  Here we go.  I love to hear this.  Ah! 
[01:04:30]  And it looks like I'm the queen.  No way.  When this happens, make this rolling star inside.  Five, man.  Get it, girl.  Get it.  Even though I try...  I mean, it's a little cute and everything, but...  It's adorable when your own daughter does it.  Right.  And you're watching her, but you don't post it online.  You ready?  Here we go.  We're going to do it nice and loud. 
[01:05:00]  Well, now, let it go.  Let it go.  Let it go.  Let it go.  How many of you?  Five million.  Five million.  Jesus Christ.  Probably the same eight people, though.  Oh.  Her grandma.  Yeah.  Oh, it's...  I gotta show you this.  Yeah, I've seen that.  What my lovely granddaughter does.  Oh, God.  Is that terrible?  First time I heard that song was on the Oscars.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's not that outrageous. 
[01:05:30]  That one kid singing Elvis is better than that.  You see that little fucking kid singing Elvis.  From Bayshore?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just saw it on...  Is it a new one, or is that the one we've been around for a little while?  We have a Let It Go parody that Ron and Fez use.  Oh, really?  Done by somebody in-house.  Oh.  Oh, interesting.  What does that mean?  Hmm? 
[01:06:00]  What does that mean?  Somebody who works here?  Yeah.  Are we gonna play this?  I mean, it's Opie and Anthony's show.  Yeah, but...  You tell me.  What kind of parody is it?  But why would we play it, is my question, I guess.  Oh, just because you were looking for a Let It Go parody, and I thought that this one  would relate to the...  But what's their spin on it?  Um, I think it's about...  It's Michelle, who works with Tim, or worked with Tim, I should say.  Whoops.  Reading internet hate, and then talking about Fez, too. 
[01:06:30]  Ugh.  Hell no.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  You get a pass on that?  Why was Tim here yesterday if he was fired?  What the hell's going on?  I don't know, for sure.  He's walking around, just socializing.  Was it yesterday?  Really enjoying the fact that he was fired.  That's...  No, it was a joke.  I've never seen anyone so happy to be fired.  I know, right?  He was having his own personal party yesterday.  I guess we're going to meet with Greenstein today, so he could sling more bullshit at us. 
[01:07:00]  He wants to meet with us and just babble nonsense at us.  Just, we'll sit down.  A whole bunch of horse shit that won't come true.  Nod your head.  I guess he got mad.  He got mad because we went to meet with him yesterday.  He got mad?  Yeah.  He got mad.  But I didn't even hear about him.  We're not going to sit there and listen to the same crap again.  Although it's time.  We meet with him, what, twice a year? 
[01:07:30]  So he can say just crap to us?  That means nothing.  We kind of get it at this point.  Look at the clock.  We get it.  You're not doing anything for the show.  You're not fixing our studio.  You know what?  Not hiring anybody new for our show.  No, it's going to be great.  It's going to be great.  Yuck.  Where were we?  Just got awkward.  Let it go.  Why did it get awkward? 
[01:08:00]  Sam.  You always have a lot to say.  Why did it just get awkward?  Yeah.  Cat's got my tongue.  I don't know.  Oh, shit.  You think he could do something for you?  Are you crazy?  He ain't doing nothing for you.  Sam knows when to employ diplomacy.  Yeah.  True.  Oh, yeah.  He's ruthless, but he could kiss a little ass.  A little.  A little.  His fucking name is the ass-hair kid. 
[01:08:30]  He's fully planted on the asshole right now.  I'm making a play.  Wow.  Yeah.  He has fucking roid marks on the side of his nose.  No kidding.  We just found your kryptonite.  Found Sam's kryptonite.  Oh, shit.  Did you like the Pearl Jam cover of this?  I mean, I didn't dislike it.  Richard, girl.  His daughter asked him to do it, so he did it.  Oh, is that what it was?  It's not that good.  This thing went or whatever.  It went everywhere.  Oh, I know.  Trust me.  I got it tweeted to me a million times. 
[01:09:00]  I didn't think it was that great.  How old was his daughter?  Five.  Oh.  I get World Star K-pop videos.  You guys get Pearl Jam.  I get black people beating the shit out of each other.  We always get Pearl Jam videos, me and Travis.  More Travis than me, I guess, but I get most of them.  Yeah, let's hear this real fast.  Pearl Jam did do Let It Go.  Let it go.  Let it go.  It was during Daughter.  Huh? 
[01:09:30]  It was during Daughter.  Because he'll tag Daughter.  Oh, I know he tags Daughter.  I know you know.  He's got to mess with Daughter.  Because I guess he's sick of singing that song, maybe.  Well, Daughter is...  I love that fucking song.  So do I.  It's great.  Yeah.  But at the end...  What does he mix it with again?  WMA.  What?  WMA.  Sometimes he'll mix it with, like, you know, The Ramones or...  Right.  He...  The Who?  Yeah, something, yeah.  Oh.  A little Rain War me.  This time it was... 
[01:10:00]  Let it go.  I like a good Eddie Vedder cover.  I've got to be honest.  He doesn't do bad covers.  That damn Ramones cover they did, which I believe in Miracles was great.  Right.  It is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He obsesses with The Who a little too much, so I wish you...  He loves...  But I wish he would, like, do other covers.  No, I'm good.  Has he ever performed with The Who?  Yes.  A while.  The Who is doing...  Well, let's play this first, then we can tell you what The Who is up to.  Stay tuned.  That's it. 
[01:10:30]  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care for you anymore.  And then it just ends. 
[01:11:00]  What, did this guy get lazy filming this?  Did his arm get tired from holding up his phone?  Somebody cut the actual video.  You can watch the whole video if you want.  But this is just the frozen part.  What is that?  We've had bleed through all day. 
[01:11:30]  Something's bleeding through.  Listen.  I don't know.  Is that going over the air?  Yeah, it's going over the air.  No one gets a fuck, though, so don't worry about it.  It's two shows for the price of one, people.  No one cares.  Don't you worry.  It's all good.  Let's say hi to Kyle in Buffalo.  Kyle.  Next time you listen to that Let It Go song, 
[01:12:00]  you've got to think about the girl sitting on the toilet.  Is Kyle there?  Kyle, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Next time you listen to that Let It Go song,  you've got to think about the girl sitting on the toilet.  Kyle, last chance.  Are you there?  I heard something.  Kyle in Buffalo.  Hello?  Kyle.  Just say hello if you're on the phone.  Hello?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Kyle.  What's up?  What's up, man?  What do you got for the show? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, the next time you listen to a Let It Go song,  you've got to think of the girl sitting on the toilet.  Your phone is crapping up.  We heard Let It Go song,  and then your phone kind of just fades out.  So I don't know if we have a bad connection or you do.  We're getting bleed through.  Could you do that again, Slower?  I just love when they just hang up like that.  Oh, God, fuck. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, shit, I'm being roped in.  A snake is coiling around me.  God damn, is that fucking funny?  All right, we're going to take a break.  Holy shit.  Eat some food.  When we come back, I don't know, we'll talk about some...  Well, we're going to talk about the who.  The big birthday bash, too.  Birthday bash?  What's that?  That we went to.  Oh. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, all right.  That was amazing.  Was it amazing?  No.  Oh, no.  Opie and Anthony will be right back.  On SiriusXM.

Digging through the history, here's a 20th anniversary Opie and Anthony radio gem. 
[01:21:00]  Classic rock.  Classic rock that really rocks, everybody.  The home of classic rock.  That's the new one.  Classic rock that really rocks.  Really rocks.  Oh, there's other classic rock out there.  Do they really rock?  I'm not sure.  They really rock.  Let me take a look at my list here.  Here's harp with Barracuda.  Those radio, and I've worked for all of them, so, you know.  But I always thought it was such a stupid thing.  The home of rock and roll.  And all the other rock stations in your area.  They're not the home of rock and roll.  No. 
[01:21:30]  So, we're the home of rock and roll.  Ah!  Oh, no.  Right on my fucking foot!  That fucking thing fell again!  Right on my fucking foot!  This could be a problem.  I can't tell you how many times last week I asked for this to be fixed,  and it just fell on my fucking bad foot.  I have a foot thing on my foot, and it just fell on it.  Don't laugh.  Why did that fall again? 
[01:22:00]  Why did that fall again on my bad foot?  He's got one of those bad foot pieces.  Dude, I got a boot on my foot because I have tendinitis, I have arthritis,  and I have ligament damage.  He's got old man foot.  And right on my goddamn foot.  That's the third time that fucking thing has fucking fallen.  Third time.  Holy shit, is that aggravating!  He just heard that freaking whack!  Scared the shit out of everybody, and then you look at this. 
[01:22:30]  It's scary, man.  Don't look like a stress doll.  Somebody squeezed his gut.  And then he just snapped.  I got a foot thing on my fucking foot.  Look at his foot.  I got an arm thing on my foot.  Look at this thing.  Look at this thing.  Look at this thing he has to wear.  It's a big foot thing.  I have enough problems.  He's going snowboarding after the show.  I'm trying to avoid surgery.  Yeah.  And I have stage four damage.  I have stage three damage.  I'm one inch from surgery. 
[01:23:00]  And now you get stage four.  And I want to bite somebody's fucking face for that.  How did that happen?  I want to know who fixed that.  Are you on the AZT for the stage?  Why did it not happen?  Why was that not fixed?  No one fixed it.  It wasn't fixed.  Holy shit, is that irritating.  It was fixed.  It wouldn't have fallen.  How big was the thing that fell, though?  It's this big.  It's a piece of it.  What is it?  It's solid.  And it falls.  It's like, it's probably eight inches off the ground.  Opie probably has fishing string over there.  Just, all right, right now again. 
[01:23:30]  Quack.  My fucking foot.  I got a foot of a foot on my foot.  Left-hand fucking foot.  Under the console, it's six inches off the ground.  There's like a little shelf.  And this is up on top of that.  So it's falling from a height.  Yeah.  Look at that.  It's not that high, but when the end of that smashes your foot, it hurts.  Look at that.  Holy shit.  And I asked for that last week to be fixed.  How did your foot get so screwed up? 
[01:24:00]  Because I had twisted it.  I have falling arches or whatever I have.  My feet are a mess, so I needed orthotics.  Yeah.  So when you have problems with your feet like that, you stand a certain way subconsciously.  You don't realize, my foot really hurts.  I'm really, really angry.  Oh, boy.  That's how I messed up my knee.  I'm sorry.  I was still talking about my foot.  Yeah.  Why do you, when you heard something, though, you have to keep repeating the body part.  Like when I, my knee, and he was like, my foot, my foot.  I have a foot thing on my foot. 
[01:24:30]  I didn't know what to say.  See how funny this can be when it's on you?  Oh, see?  See?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Right, right, right, right, right, right on my fucking foot.  Right, right, right on my fucking foot.  That, that fucking thing, that, that fucking thing fell, fell, fell, fell again right on 
[01:25:00]  my fucking foot.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Right, right, right, right on my fucking foot.  F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F 
[01:25:30]  The Opio and Anthony Show is back 
[01:26:00]  On Sirius XM.  The Who. 
[01:26:30]  The Who.  What's that?  I-W-N-E-W.  Miss you, Scotty.  Scott Muni, everyone.  Thank you for making these guys.  He loved the Who.  Keith Moon.  Keith Moon.  Ain't no cure for the summertime blue. 
[01:27:00]  I've been meaning to buy that Beach Boys greatest hit since that last one.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  You should go Who's greatest hits.  I have it.  You do?  Yeah, yeah.  Who?  Or maybe get a little odds and sods.  What are these odds and sods?  I don't know.  It's something British.  Odds and sods.  Something British.  Oh, this is from Odds and Sods?  Yes.  That was Keith Moon right there, right? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  You got to sing a little bit here and there.  You look for the summertime blue.  Blue.  Mams.  Summertime song.  Nice.  Firecracker 500.  Firecracker 500.  500 this weekend.  Counting down 500 top songs.  The best summertime song. 
[01:28:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  A lot of 4th of July specials.  Yeah, what are they doing around the dial for the 4th of July?  Firecracker 500.  500.  Yeah.  You don't know, Iraq?  That's your gig.  I haven't seen anything promoted.  A lot of stations are just going commercial free on the weekends for the summer.  Oh, that's their thing?  Yeah.  Like, Clear Channel's really into that.  Commercial free for the summer.  Like, W-A-P-P.  Yes.  And then as soon as they played that first commercial, everyone was gone. 
[01:28:30]  Gone.  And that didn't work out well.  B-A-P jumped on it.  The WAP has gone wimp.  Oh, really?  That's what they said?  Yeah, because they kind of went to some kind of easy format or something.  That used to be a big deal, commercial free.  Oh, yeah.  But now it doesn't matter because you just turn the dial.  There's so many choices.  Like, why would you ever sit through a commercial?  There is no need.  Except for our sponsors, of course, because we do amazing live reads. 
[01:29:00]  Yes.  And you never know what's going to happen during the live reads.  It's like a portion of the show.  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  Anyway, The Who announces first leg of their 50th anniversary tour.  Wow.  And this is the bad news.  They're also going to record a new album.  Oh, wow.  I hate when artists do that.  You think that's good news?  New album from The Who?  Obviously, Sabbath pulled it off. 
[01:29:30]  But a lot of the bands, they have no business trying to put out new music anymore.  You don't think The Who can...  I think Journey tried it, and that was a bust.  And then you're at the show, and you're like, we're going to play a few from our new album.  Oh, no.  What do you need, man?  A beer?  Yeah, exactly.  You okay?  I'm going to go up, take a piss.  You don't want to hear the new ones?  I'll come with you.  I'll come with you.  Yeah. 
[01:30:00]  That's exactly it.  Nice.  No.  Who wants to hear the new ones?  And then they always have to talk down you.  Hey, you think it's okay we try a few new ones tonight?  And then the lackluster.  You think it'll be all right?  We've got a few new songs we want to play for you guys tonight off our new album.  A few of the die-hard, die-hard fans are the only ones standing up, like, bobbing their head.  Right.  Yeah, this is good.  No, it stinks. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Play Return to the Airwaves.  That's good.  Oh, no.  How come every band does their wear-back song?  Yeah, Return to the Airwaves?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have a little of that?  I don't.  Return to the Airwaves!  Oh, God, I hate that already.  You don't like it?  I don't even like the title.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Yes.  This is what Van Halen did, right? 
[01:31:00]  After they went away for a while?  Yeah, that's good.  Back and better than ever.  You know, I didn't like the guitar that Sal put in this one.  No?  We've been away for a long, long, long, long time.  I think it had to take away some of the pizzazz.  We played some games.  The more things change, the more things stay the same.  Stay the same.  All right.  We're back.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  We're better than ever.  We're back.  You didn't like we're a little bit older, but we ain't much wiser?  No.  No.  I didn't like any of we're back and better than ever.  We're back.  We're back.  I'd go see the hoop.  I don't know about that.  I would definitely go see the hoop.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Maybe Roger Daltrey could come in here and talk about the hoop next time.  No.  That would be nice.  He came in, but we were a bit starstruck.  That was one of those days where I think we were all a bit starstruck. 
[01:32:00]  He didn't want to talk about anything but his charity that day.  What was his charity?  I forgot.  I don't know.  It was kids, I think.  Something with kids.  Something about kids that were kids.  Does he feel a little guilty about his bandmate?  So he starts a kid's charity.  Maybe that's it.  Yeah.  Oh, the horrors he must have committed.  Right.  Like, I was completely into The Who growing up, but I would not buy their new album now. 
[01:32:30]  So who's their audience?  But does that make you the audience?  Who's their audience?  Well, it makes me the demo that is a Who fan, or was.  So who do they expect is going to buy this album, if not the likes of me, moi?  There's certain bands that have no desire to hear their new music, but Pearl Jam, when  they released new stuff, still in.  Yeah.  Who else?  Well, you don't really like the Almond Bros, but when they were still, like, putting out 
[01:33:00]  new stuff, I was in.  You two, right?  When you make them out?  Yeah, but you two never went away.  I guess I'm talking about the bands that...  And it went on the...  Pearl Jam technically never went away.  Smaller venue circuit?  Pearl Jam technically never went away, right, Travis?  They didn't take a hiatus since Alive.  No.  They just never went away.  Their popularity dropped drastically for a while.  And then I remember there was an article, I think, in Rolling Stone Magazine or something,  basically saying, you know, Pearl Jam never went away. 
[01:33:30]  They just reinvented themselves.  Yeah.  And now they're just huge again.  Yes.  Right.  You remember the article, right?  And they were talking about bootlegging and all that, and they allowed their fans to  tape their stuff kind of using the Grateful Dead model.  Yeah, I mean, they were...  And that helped their popularity to continue.  They were one of the first people to just let you, you know, record, and also to release  their own albums.  I mean, they were available in stores for a while.  Oh, God, Travis, pick your dick away.  Look, he's jerking off talking about it.  They played Strangers Tribe for the first time last week.  How great is that? 
[01:34:00]  Wow.  Amazing.  Oh.  Absolutely amazing.  Are they coming around close?  No, not this year.  Fuck.  They were here last year.  Why do you skip New York?  Why do you skip New York?  Because they have to play to the world.  They have to play to the entire world.  Yeah, that's true.  They were in Europe.  That's how big this band is, where they actually have to sit down and go, wow, we're not going  to be able to get to New York.  They do a month here, a month there.  Boston's been canceled.  It's no worry.  Not a big college town.  How many dates do they do a year, Travis? 
[01:34:30]  I would say on a non-album year, probably 20.  Oh, really?  25.  That's it?  Okay.  Yeah, I mean, they'll do like 10 dates in Europe, and they're doing like a short little  Midwest tour later on this year.  Gotcha.  All right.  But when an album's out, yeah, they'll do a proper tour.  They'll be back in a few years.  We'll go see them again.  Yeah, we will.  Yeah, we will.  Oh, man.  How old is Eddie Bedford, 50?  He's close to 50.  He's right around there.  Late 40s.  I would go see The Who, too. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, absolutely.  Roger Daltrey coming in here is one of the coolest things.  That was crazy.  That was great.  Yeah.  And then I saw him.  I was walking to Central Park.  Oh, right.  And he walked by with a guy, so I basically just said, hey, Roger.  Oh.  Looked at me.  I'm like, you're on our show today.  Yeah.  No, no recollection that he met a goldfish, met me, was on the show.  I even said, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, you didn't.  I had to.  Yikes.  And then he gave me the plane. 
[01:35:30]  And then I kept walking.  Not that I wanted to sit there and have a conversation with him in the street.  Tiny little man.  I just thought, you know, you're on our show today, so maybe I could say hi to you.  Sometimes you think that gives you an in.  And it's so embarrassing.  I just wanted to, like, hey, you're on our show.  I see you now on the street.  I just want to say hi.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, sometimes you think it's going to give you this one-up on anyone else that you  just spoke with somebody or they've been on your show.  And it just doesn't. 
[01:36:00]  And it's ten times more embarrassing.  There are times, as soon as these mics go off, the person forgot us.  Yeah.  You see him actually in the hall.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just interviewed him.  Yes, I've gone to leave and gone to the elevators.  Sometimes you're in the elevator with the guy.  I'm like, hey, take it easy.  And they're like, oh, they look at you like without this familiarity.  It's, you just saw me.  Oh, yeah, thanks.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, hey.  We ended the show.  Wow.  And now we're in the elevator together leaving at the same time. 
[01:36:30]  Sorry I'm bothering you, but.  You think too much of yourself.  I've seen him in the room, like, look over like they're coming out of a blackout.  What am I doing here?  Who are you?  Look over this way.  Oh, the stones.  Stones are a good one.  Oh, yeah?  I'm not into, like, new stones whatsoever.  What was that last one they threw by us in it?  It was kind of catchy, but.  They put it on their last part of the show.  Gorilla something?  What was it?  Gorilla?  Was it? 
[01:37:00]  I forgot it now.  Yeah.  Hang on.  I thought it was.  Gorilla.  I might be wrong.  Hang on.  Steel Wheels.  Steel Wheels.  Steel Wheels tour.  Undercover of the news.  Of the news.  One more shot?  No.  Doom and Gloom?  Yeah, it was Doom and Gloom.  Oh, yeah, Doom and Gloom.  Actually, it wasn't that bad.  Was there a Gorilla picture?  Why am I thinking of that?  What's the album cover look like?  It was, uh.  Yeah, Doom and Gloom wasn't that bad. 
[01:37:30]  No, that was a cool video, right?  You know what?  That wasn't bad.  Oh, you're right, Jimmy.  Okay, that's why.  It was her greatest hits.  Watch it.  What happened?  Why is she here?  What happened?  Hold on a minute.  I don't know.  Oh, no.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, this is Sandy Kane, the naked cowgirl in the house.  Hi, Sandy.  Sandy, what are you doing downstairs?  Well, I have my brand new CG.  I want you to premiere it on your show.  Oh, we'd be honored. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, my God.  Are you serious?  You chose us?  Of course.  Oh, man.  That's so nice.  You're not going to sue us today, are you?  I also have the update with the cops.  They love you, the Opie and Anthony show.  Nice.  Sergeant Michael Dietrich, and he wants to know, he wanted to just give a shout out to you guys,  because they will love you on me.  I heard the soundbites of Sandy Kane talking about... 
[01:38:30]  All right, all right.  I got some things I got to ask you.  When you sued me and Anthony and made us go down to the courts three times, it's one  of my favorite things that has happened in recent years, by the way.  Great gag.  Were you sort of thinking of showing up, or the whole time you just decided to fuck with  us?  No.  What happened was I did show up, and then they scheduled me at night.  They scheduled you in the morning.  Oh.  So then I was showing up again, and God said, don't do it. 
[01:39:00]  God said, don't do it?  Yeah, it was Pastor Joel Osteen.  Oh, right.  You did tell us that.  So yeah, Joel said, let him go.  Are you a fan of Joel?  That is cool.  He's creepy, Sandy Kane.  Ah, he is great.  He's a great pastor, and the Lakewood Church, and he's always, you know, he's a great man. 
[01:39:30]  And hey, you should be a fan, because he says, let them go.  He's finding God.  Very, very bitter.  Well, I don't know.  I think she always...  Quato said unto thee.  Were you always...  My song, I Love Nick, is 18.  It's out one week.  It's on 18 stations all over the country.  So I wanted to bring you the CG from American Tadies.  She's Scorch.  We would be honored to have you come up to us.  You're not supposed to like someone that sued you three times. 
[01:40:00]  But there was something about that.  Sandy is a delight.  Me and Anthony were bonding and laughing at the nonsense that we had to watch.  That was crazy.  They wouldn't let us go.  We had to stay there for like two hours.  Sit there.  And watch everyone else.  Watch everyone else go through their bullshit.  And then when they finally said, well, she's not showing up, we would leave and just start laughing.  Like, instead of being really mad, I was just laughing.  She fucking got us again.  And then we would get the paperwork in the mail again. 
[01:40:30]  And show up in another month to do the whole thing over again.  Well, you know, guys, what did you put me through when you broke my guitar?  Well, we understand, but like Joel said, let's just let it go, okay?  No, I'm letting it go, man.  All right.  Man, man, man.  I love it.  In my fucking life, man.  How up?  I did Jim Norton yesterday.  Jim Norton was in Times Square.  Yeah, I did see Sam yesterday. 
[01:41:00]  For the Jim Norton show, am I allowed to say it, Jim?  I don't know.  Well, let's just say Sandy played a little part of it.  It's a good thing to ask after.  But yeah, it's okay.  Is someone going down to get her?  Yeah, we'll get you up here.  Sandy, we'll get you up here to come in.  Someone's coming down.  I got this song on my phone.  Okay, someone's coming up.  Yeah, why would we, you know, why are we interviewing her on the phone when...  Can't wait to sue you.  I mean, see you.  Sorry, we'll see you in a minute.  She's a pip.  I got to ask her about the quad thing. 
[01:41:30]  I think she's always been a quad lady.  God-fearing?  I think so.  Isn't she of the Hebrew persuasion?  Oh, right.  I would assume.  That's right.  We'll see what she believes.  All right.  Indeed he do.  Where were we?  I don't know.  Eddie Vedder, Pearl Jam.  Ah, right.  We were wrapping up with Pearl Jam.  I think we were just getting started.  Yeah.  Pretty sure.  I'm telling you, man.  One of the best concerts you could go see is Pearl Jam. 
[01:42:00]  They got that shit figured out.  I'm serious.  That's good.  How about you just try it next time?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Can I just...  I've only done...  Can they play all their hits up front so I could just leave?  No, why would you want to do that?  30 songs, three hours?  30 songs?  Yeah.  Do you want to go three?  Out of the 30 songs, you know well over 20 of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Easily.  Yeah, yeah.  They've had a long and lustrous career.  Illustrious.  I've only seen them twice.  I don't know why it took me so long to go see Pearl Jam in concert. 
[01:42:30]  Don't worry.  Only twice.  I think twice.  Maybe three times.  That's it.  Mm-hmm.  And I'll go every time now.  Every fucking time.  Of course you will.  All right.  Great show.  Damn.  Got down on the floor last time.  It was awesome.  Right.  Yeah, it was great.  Well, we have super fans that...  He tried to show me the set list.  Oh, he got so mad.  Yeah.  He never wanted to say it.  Spoiler.  Put that away.  Spoiler.  Charles got so mad.  And he's like, I know what's coming up next.  I'm going to get a beer.  I did say that.  I forgot what song it was. 
[01:43:00]  I'm like, okay.  I could safely get a beer.  Beer song?  I could safely...  Nothing worse when you're reading online and hear that song that you wanted to hear.  It's like, oh, it's the one.  I hurry.  Hurry.  The reason I'm here.  God damn it.  Right.  They have something going on at Shade across the hall.  That is just fucking like...  I think they can do whatever they want.  Of course.  They're bringing in those chafing dishes, things, like setting up a buffet. 
[01:43:30]  Right.  And then you just see them going with a box.  A box of booze.  And a blender.  And mixers.  Well, get Heather in here.  The garbage can outside their studio, like when we come in in the morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's just, you know, bottles and pizzas.  How is that allowed?  It's a party.  Ah.  I bet if we try that, we'd get a little jam up.  Your problem is that you ask.  If we had a friggin' booze fest in here.  Well, maybe we did.  We did the tequila thing. 
[01:44:00]  Kenny is always out there in the hallway to see what goes by.  What's up, Kenny?  I think you're mistaken about what you're seeing.  Uh-oh.  Really?  I didn't see nothing?  No.  All right.  I didn't see nothing.  Yeah.  Really?  They're sneaking some shit by me.  We don't want a world star video of me getting pummeled in the hallway.  Yeah.  There's nothing going on.  There's nothing over there.  No.  Nothing.  All right.  Business as usual.  All right.  All right.  Where's Heather?  I hear you.  Where's Heather?  She can't talk about it. 
[01:44:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they're not going to blow up their spot.  Oh.  Yeah.  See, that's their success story.  They're discreet.  And they're smart because they closed the curtains, so you have no idea what's going on.  And it's always closed, so you don't see it closed and think, what's going on in there?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, we blow it, because now when we close the curtains, they know some shit's going on in there.  They're like, what's going on in there?  You're right.  They really are.  They lack the darkness in there.  We got to close the curtains on those mundane shows. 
[01:45:00]  They'll pop in a few times.  Well, the Tuesdayn shows, too, or something.  Nothing, Chippa.  I didn't hear what you said.  I apologize.  I didn't mean to miss one.  Go right ahead.  It's over, Chippa.  Sometimes repeating a joke works wonders.  Hey, we got an update on the fucker in the pussy.  Yeah, there's a video.  The fucker in her pussy or whatever is really taking over the internet. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, I've noticed people are memeing.  They're memeing.  Could you play the one from yesterday?  They were doing the World Cup thing.  That was a good one.  Yeah, this guy.  It's on Deadspin.  The flags are waving, and even though it's been a few hours since Brazil took the game,  the party is still going on here.  Now, Brazil beat up Chile 3-2, but it was a nail-biter.  It was a very, very close call.  I want to bring in some of the fans.  How nervous are you guys watching this game?  I was really nervous. 
[01:46:00]  Fuck her right in the pussy.  Oh, okay.  You should disregard that.  I was really nervous.  Disregard that is my favorite part.  She's cool, though, because she's smiling through it.  Yeah, yeah.  She's Canadian.  She's Canadian.  It's based on the fake video where the guy...  It's this one.  Can you play the fake one again?  No, go down, Travis.  You had it.  This fucking idiot.  That's great.  It's fake.  It's so fake.  Oh, I don't care if she's 20.  No, I'd fuck her.  You can't say you wouldn't fuck her.  Maybe that's what I'll do when they find her.  I'll go and fuck her. 
[01:46:30]  Fuck her right in her pussy.  Fuck yeah.  And that was sent around as a real video.  The fake shit that people put out there, and then other people say,  Wow, it's amazing.  Right.  It's so funny.  You've got to see this.  The old dude sitting at the table that is fucking with something,  and it blows up.  Right.  And his hair ends up all fucked up.  Yep, right.  That's fucking fake.  What ain't?  Dude, I was laughing so hard.  Look at his hair at the end.  It's so badly done, too. 
[01:47:00]  But fuck her right in the pussy.  Fuck her right in the pussy is real now.  That's become a real thing.  Because then you had that older guy that did it, too.  With the hoodie and the sunglasses.  Oh.  Unabomber?  Yeah, you guys know.  You guys know.  When did that happen?  That went viral.  Did it?  Wop.  Wop.  He ran up to the reporter, grabbed the mic.  Oh.  Oh, yeah, that guy.  Yeah.  That guy looked crazy.  He's like an internet star now.  They interview him now about what he did.  Uh-huh. 
[01:47:30]  I don't know how I'd find that.  Yeah.  Oh, this guy.  Yeah, this guy.  Yeah, there he is.  Yeah, but isn't this fake, too?  I don't know.  Is it?  Yeah, I think it is.  Uh-oh.  I haven't seen it.  Oh, God.  Is it fake?  Yeah.  Oh, God, no.  I'm pretty sure.  Oh, God, no.  Play it.  Let's see.  Oh, no.  No, that's the guy.  Oh, God.  That's the fake guy again.  I apologize for in that.  Fuck it right in the pussy.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.  It took Cruz longer than anticipated to find the crack in the 64-year-old pipeline.  I'm standing here with Fred, who says he was greatly impacted by the gushing of oil. 
[01:48:00]  Can you tell us a little more of what you saw?  I sure can.  I was sitting on my front porch, grabbed the beer, and fuck her right in the pussy.  That's fake.  Oh, it's not fake?  Is that guy fake?  The old guy?  It doesn't look it.  The old guy who said fuck her right in the pussy.  Is that fake, too?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck!  That's real.  I thought it was fake.  That was well done, though.  Yeah.  You thought that was fake?  I couldn't tell, because there was no indication whether it was fake or not. 
[01:48:30]  It was fake, right?  I don't know.  What were the clues?  What were the clues?  Fuck.  That it was obviously fake.  Was it the logo?  It's usually the logo.  Problem.  Yeah.  Problem.  Problem.  All right.  Well, I got taken on that one.  It just says, like, Fox on the bottom.  There's no channel number or CBS or something.  What makes this a new CD, by the way?  Oh, shit.  What makes this a new CD?  Oh, Sandy Cain's a new CD.  It has all the same songs we've been playing for, like, 15 years on it. 
[01:49:00]  No, no, no.  I love Dick.  No, that's not the song.  I love Dick.  A Boy Named Sue, we played that.  I Love Nick.  I Love Nick.  The new song is I Love Nick.  Right.  Includes four bonus videos.  The naked cowgirl in Berlin singing I Love Dick.  In Berlin?  That's great.  You could tell it's new, because you could see the cover and read the America's Got Talent  judges.  Is she going to get sued, you think?  And why is she using pictures of the old judges?  Who are the judges on there? 
[01:49:30]  Well, the judges on her brand new CD are Howie Mandel, who's still there, Sharon Osbourne,  who's long gone, and Piers Morgan.  Wow.  What the fuck?  We'll have to ask her about that.  Me and...  They were probably the three that gave her clearance.  I see.  Sam, what's the update on the fucker in the pussy, or right in the pussy?  Oh, yes.  From the Brazilian news clip.  Well, this is the same reporter who had that happen to her, right? 
[01:50:00]  Had another one of her live shots invaded, I think...  Oh, really?  ...within days.  By more fucker in the pussy, guys?  No, by different people.  Oh, different one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Damn.  This cough is stunning.  Just stunning, what it's doing to my voice.  I was driving in this morning.  I'm like, well, I could cough, maybe crash.  Jesus.  Or, you know, when you just double over and... 
[01:50:30]  Was it the same time last year you got it?  No.  No.  Different.  It's different.  It's not that same, but now it's just...  It's giving me that voice.  I can hear you.  Fuck.  I'm a broadcaster, for the love of Christ.  Sexy voice.  Yeah, I know.  I am sexy.  A little Demi Moore.  Right?  Here's the same reporter.  Look what happened to her.  Gary Moore.  She's reporting at the Pride Festival. 
[01:51:00]  Oh.  World Pride closing ceremonies have just wrapped up,  and you can see the remnants of tens of thousands of people here.  It has been the biggest day today of the...  That's great.  Wow, she's unflappable, this girl.  She's great.  She's pretty, right?  Yeah.  I want to kiss her.  Wait, did she come down to New York,  or do they have one of those in Canada as well?  I think it was in Canada. 
[01:51:30]  Pride Toronto.  Is it franchise, the Pride Parade?  Pride.  I think the Pride Parade.  They all do it the same day now?  Worldwide.  Wait, was that not the Gay Pride Parade, or is it...  I think it's different.  It is different.  I think there's Pride Day, and then there's the Gay Pride Parade.  When's Gay Pride Parade?  I don't know.  I hadn't heard about it.  Nice try.  Pride Day is...  Like, it's supposed to be kind of a universal thing.  She's got a nice set, this one.  She actually had some pretty...  Not bad.  ...pretty nice titties there.  We'll put it up on our...  Well, we'll certainly send the link out on our Twitter,  O&A Show, if you want to see the videos that we check out on our radio show. 
[01:52:00]  She's jumping around, too, so they jiggle.  She should be proud.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was a lesbian, I would assume.  She's the L part of the G-L-B-L-T-B-L-T-B-T-L killer.  Or the T.  She's the L-T.  Or the T.  Oh, well, I don't think she's the T.  Nah, could be.  Could be B.  Sell me initials with the gay people.  Well, they're adding letters every day now.  It's just insane. 
[01:52:30]  Brad in Kentucky.  Brad.  Brad.  Hey, Opie, how are y'all doing?  Man, I love y'all.  Great show.  Hey, that fuck them in the pussy from what the old man with the glasses on.  And the hoodie?  It's true.  I watched it on WCPO in Cincinnati.  It was on Coleraine Avenue.  They had an oil spill.  And it was actually...  That was actually...  That was dead on...  I got it on DVR everything.  I think it's real. 
[01:53:00]  Everything.  I shit you not, it was the funniest shit I ever seen because the starcasters, when they  went flashback, did not know what to do or say, and they were scrambling like a mug.  This guy saw it on TV.  It's real.  It's okay.  He saw it on the television.  It's like the internet.  If it's on the TV, it's true, right?  Is that when the Donner party ate each other up?  That's when that little nigger boy went running down the street.  Jesus.  Wow.  Happens. 
[01:53:30]  Trying to have a little fun here, and you'll throw that out there.  What does it say, Sam?  Well, this is another...  I mean, it's the same old man.  Right.  Yeah.  How is this old man getting like everywhere?  Come on.  News channels.  I don't buy it.  Real or fake?  Maybe get on twice for the same story.  Maybe two different news crews in the same area.  Just reading this.  Media, you know, spotted a bunch of inconsistencies.  Oh.  I'll send it to you on a DVD.  The reporters don't work for the station.  We don't need it on a DVD.  What year is this? 
[01:54:00]  Fake and gay.  Fake and gay.  Fake and gay.  All right.  Thank you, Brad.  It's full of turkey.  Yeah.  He's going to send it to us on a DVD, though.  Sure.  That's real.  We'll see about that right now.  He's just going to send us the video on a DVD.  A DVD.  It's going to mail it between two pieces of cardboard so it doesn't bend.  Right.  We've got to take a break, and then Sandy Kane's going to talk about her almost new CD.

[02:04:00]  Welcome to Attainable Dating Solutions,  video dating for the unwashed and socially inept.  Profile TWTO94, Sandy Cain.  Hi, this is Sandy Cain,  the naked cowgirl in the house, folks.  Yeah, so I'm still looking for Mr. Right, 
[02:04:30]  because Mr. Wrong always did me wrong.  So I'm looking for a man who has a good job  and who's something glamorous and something,  has a big dick, of course,  and big balls,  and really, I'm part lesbian because I'd like a man to eat out.  When I was a fucking hooker, baby, I was.  I admit it, man, things were that bad as a stripper.  People think strippers make money.  It was really bad.  So, I mean, I used to snort cocaine 
[02:05:00]  and be a hooker.  I could only be a hooker if I snorted cocaine.  I had once five Latin guys in upper Manhattan.  I worked at this place,  Ticardo Fucking Mucho, man,  and they had great cocaine,  and we fucked five fucking guys,  and it was fun.  You know, I did get a trichomonas one time.  That's what happened.  I got trichomonas from, like, so many guys coming me.  I mean, I wasn't a good hooker. 
[02:05:30]  I really just would open my legs  and, like, just, you know, get the money  because I was so poor.  And the cum in my pussy.  Now, why should a person date me now?  Well, I think I'm a pretty good lover.  I think with all the experience I've had,  and I think that we'd have a good time.  So I wouldn't even tell a guy I have a genital wart.  If he saw it, he'd, like, look at it and say,  uh, why don't you have that thing taken off? 
[02:06:00]  And I'm going, why bother?  And Nick Cannon was hot.  You know, it was just like,  white men, black men, give me the green.  No, but can I really do it without getting money?  Yes, I probably could.  But, you know, it's hard to have sex with someone,  to take off your underwear,  to show them your pussy and your titties and stuff.  It's so intimate that, um,  maybe with cocaine, though,  I could still do it.  Call the Opie and Anthony show,  and we will hook up.  866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[02:06:30]  That's 866-969-1969,  my favorite number.  Oh, boy, and I will suck that dick  like you will never, ever have another blowjob again.  Call the Opie and Anthony show today.  Shandy Kane does.  Open and Anthony are back.  On Sirius XM. 
[02:07:00]  Denny got you some Beach Boys.  Nice.  I love the neediness around here.  Oh, Denny.  Jimmy's talking about the Beach Boys  and how, you know,  he wants to download the greatest hits.  And there's Denny.  He made me a copy from his CD.  My hard drive and hits.  Should we get him in here  just so you can thank him properly?  No, that's fine.  Really?  Sure, I'll be delighted to thank Denny  for the guitar picks as well.  Really?  Yeah.  God, Denny figured out  how to get back on our radio show. 
[02:07:30]  Guitar picks.  Some cool ones, yeah.  It's a nice camera.  Yeah?  Where did he get the guitar picks from?  I don't know.  Oh, for somebody who was in,  he got rid of them,  but they were James Hetfield,  I guess, threw them out in San Francisco.  One of the guys is a big Giants fan.  He's a San Francisco guy.  Yeah, they are.  Look at Denny.  Denny Philokone.  Anthony's photographing him right now,  and he's on 8th Avenue  with a fucking camera lens.  Wow.  That looks old, though,  because the color's weird.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a grayish,  so it looks like a really old lens. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, it's a new one, though.  I don't know why they make it that color.  Wow.  Somebody wants to get some discreet photos.  Yeah.  That lens belongs in a bush.  Yeah, it certainly does.  I was taking pictures from my apartment,  and there's a, I guess...  Teenage girl, what?  No, it's a hotel.  It's like a motel.  It's fucking...  With all their windows facing my apartment,  so I was using this 200 millimeter, 
[02:08:30]  and we get some pretty fucking good pictures.  I didn't get any nudes.  No nudes.  But I got some women, like,  walking around in little fucking nighties and shit.  Really?  I want to see one.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll take a few.  Is that illegal?  A few more later.  I don't think it is.  I think if you're just fucking out by your window,  and the window's open...  That's from your window, too.  It's none of your fucking business.  And they don't believe in shades.  It's all expectation of privacy.  Man.  And how, you know,  what privacy can you expect  if you're just fucking hanging out?  E-Rock, coming.  Remember the windows at K-Rock? 
[02:09:00]  Oh, yeah.  I wish I had this then.  That was amazing.  This then.  I know we've said it a million times,  but can I just say,  we did afternoon drive at N.E.W.,  and remember the girls would come home  and get ready for happy hour,  and then there was at least three or four showers.  Wait, which one are you talking about?  K-Rock?  I was talking about K-Rock  because we had the big window in the studio  and then the one in the office.  Right.  We had it at XM at one point  until they knocked that building down  where that old steakhouse used to be. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, but you missed...  No, but N.E.W. had the showers  right off the side of the studio.  You missed the N.E.W. days  where, yeah,  it was a whole line of showers,  and it was almost a guarantee  we would see a woman showering.  A nubile woman.  Almost every day.  I would say  at least three out of the five days  we were there,  we would see women showering  getting ready for happy hour.  And then, of course,  yeah, I forgot about the K-Rock window  where that disgusting pig  would exercise naked. 
[02:10:00]  On the bike.  She'd be on her exercise bike.  And that should be exciting  and titillating,  but she was a mess, remember?  Did she know we were watching  that for 2K?  She had to have known.  It was great.  She had a big bush.  There was one or two  really good ones.  Remember her big bush?  We didn't see that.  Oh, then we saw  that other couple.  Yeah, there was one other good one,  and then there was one  from the office at K-Rock  that you could see  that was facing  the other direction.  What about the XM  where they had that short building  across the street?  That's the one I'm talking about.  They had a weird little  like kind of a penthouse-y  like apartment. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, patio.  You would see some nudes in there.  Yeah, they were fucking in there.  Doing some of that fucking.  Denny.  Oh, yeah.  Morning, gentlemen.  How are you?  Denny Falco.  Getting ready  for the big holiday weekend.  That's right.  Big three-day weekend.  Holiday weekend.  And you're doing a fucking wedding  instead of Anthony's party.  Sorry, I got a contract.  What's wrong with you?  A contract.  A contract.  Put a contract out on you.  Oh, it was January.  It was signed?  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, but you knew  he was going to have a party.  Why wouldn't you?  January? 
[02:11:00]  Huh?  I booked this in January.  January.  Hot.  It happens.  Signed contract stuff.  Sorry.  It happens.  What are people doing  on the radio  4th of July?  What are some of the big events  around the dial?  You mentioned  the Firecracker 500.  Yes.  Counting them down.  Counting them down.  Counting them down.  The Firecracker 500,  of course.  Beach Boys always do  a lot of Beach Boys.  Boys of Summer.  Ah, the Summer.  Of course.  Yeah, the Boys of Summer.  Very good band.  Favorite summer songs,  things like that. 
[02:11:30]  Where were you  in the summer of 75  when this was a hit?  Maybe you were rubbing  on some suntan lotion  on the beach.  Ah, God.  Stuff like that.  Bring people right back.  Oh, no.  I love it.  Bring people right back.  Bring people right back.  Remember radio stations  used to do the class...  This weekend,  it's the class of 80.  Yeah, I love class reunion.  Class reunion weekend.  Class reunion,  summertime 1969,  on the road to Woodstock.  Let's crank this one up.  I see SNY.  You know?  You know, right?  I love it.  Bring people back.  Anybody can play the music, 
[02:12:00]  but it's...  Oh, yeah.  It's the things you say  between the records.  Right.  The DJ's got to spark  that memory.  Sure.  And you guys were talking  about the groups  that play new music  at shows.  It's a shame  because people...  Mike Love does that  all the time.  Hey, we got a brand new song.  Who cares about  a new Mike Love song?  It's a shame.  It really is.  I'd rather just hear  some Beach Boys.  Beach Boy fanatics  do like the new stuff  like that.  But you know what?  Small percentage  of the people,  though, I think.  I see it as time  that could be spent  playing another one  of the hits.  Right. 
[02:12:30]  And they just ran out  of things to sing about.  Yeah, come on.  They're now singing  about the sand  between their toes  or something.  And they're, you know,  they're 70 years old  singing about,  you know,  surfing.  surfing on the beach.  Did you see  the Mick Jagger video  that he poked fun  at Monty Python?  It's a good video.  It's funny.  That's making  the rounds today.  Oh, we like funny.  You like funny.  He's sitting down  on the couch  with Charlie Watts.  Really?  Let's see funny.  What did you see?  The new Beach Boys song  is not good.  No.  Because now we're surfing. 
[02:13:00]  Surfing on the web.  You don't like that, Sam?  No.  Oh, is that awful?  All right, here it is.  Denny brought some funny  to our show.  Thank you, Denny.  Was this for the  Monty Python live show?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Let's see what it's all about.  Oh, no! 
[02:13:30]  Oh, it was amazing.  Hey, Mick,  you wanted to look  at the set list  for Tomorrow Night?  Yeah.  There's all this stuff  in the paper  about the review  that the lighting's  too dark and everything.  Where's Patrick?  He's not here.  He's in London.  Patrick.  Oh, what's he doing  in London?  The Monty Python.  The show's at the O2.  Oh, yeah.  Monty Python?  Are they still going?  Yeah.  They're doing 10 shows.  Do you want to go?  10 shows?  That's...  Wow, that's pretty amazing.  It must be corny.  I mean, I bet it's expensive. 
[02:14:00]  But, I mean,  who wants to...  Who wants to see that again, really?  I mean, it was really funny  in the 60s.  Well, the first show  sold out in 40 seconds.  Wow, that's pretty amazing.  I mean,  still a bunch of wrinkly old men  trying to relive their youth  and make a load of money.  I mean, the best one  died years ago.  Maybe back in the 70s  it was fantastic.  I mean, it was the funniest thing.  I mean,  I mean, you've seen it all before.  I mean,  I mean,  they put it all up on YouTube. 
[02:14:30]  Well,  anyway,  what did you want to do tomorrow night?  Well,  we'll start with something  everyone knows,  like,  let's spend the night together  and then we can move on  to Get Off My Cloud  and then  then she'll hit satisfaction,  I think, then.  Dead Parrot Sketch.  Dead Parrot Sketch.  Yeah,  Dead Parrot Sketch.  Dead Parrot Sketch.  That's pretty good.  It's all right.  It's funny.  A little self-deprecating.  Charlie Watts was good.  Yeah.  Jesus.  He probably tried to say one thing 
[02:15:00]  and Mick's like,  I got it.  Yeah,  don't worry about it.  Do you like Charlie Watts' jazz stuff?  He does that whole big band thing.  Oh,  does he?  Is it good?  Yeah,  it's good.  I had no idea it even existed.  There's real big band music.  I cannot stand that.  You know,  How can you tell when big band is bad?  Yeah.  Big band stuff or jazz stuff  or it's jazz big band.  Jazz Odyssey.  You're not a big jazz fan.  I hate the jazz.  I hate it.  Not only just don't like it. 
[02:15:30]  I hate it.  It's a little cool jazz,  relaxing by the pool.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Ah.  Ah.  Listen to this shit.  Oh.  The drumming's good.  Ah.  What the fuck?  You don't like this? 
[02:16:00]  Listen to it.  What?  Welcome to the Hotel Excelsior.  This is so fucking just self-absorbed crap on the part of the musician.  But as a musician, I mean, they're really playing.  No.  No.  This is garbage.  Listen to it.  The trumpet player is playing one thing.  The drummer, what the fuck is he doing right now? 
[02:16:30]  The drummer's good, though.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Who is this?  Miles Davis.  Oh, Miles Davis.  Godspeed, Miles.  If you don't like a little smooth jazz, a little samba music when you're sitting by the pool.  Samba music.  Stan Getz.  Mamba.  What's he get?  The Mamba Carlos.  Girl from Ipanema.  No.  Desafonado.  Stan Getz.  Wait, watch this. 
[02:17:00]  What's he get?  Classic chip joke right there.  Well, you enjoy that Beach Boy music.  I want you to do that.  That's good shit.  What else are they doing on the radio?  I will, actually.  What else are we doing?  I know on the 70s, we're doing a salute to muscle cars.  All the muscle cars of the 70s.  Wait, wait.  This is a joke, right?  No.  This is your bit.  Yeah.  This has to be a bit.  No, seriously.  If you go on the SiriusXM website for 70s on 7, they're going to do a salute to muscle cars. 
[02:17:30]  How do you do a salute to muscle cars?  Very good question.  How do you do that?  I asked the program director that, and he goes, oh, don't worry.  It's going to be great.  So I believed him.  So are they songs?  Is there any promos we could hear?  I don't think we made any promos for it.  I kind of like the 70s on 7.  I do like that channel.  Oh, I'll listen to that.  I'll get that.  I'm not going to get into a muscle car discussion.  What is it?  Do you play songs that revolve around cars of the day?  I guess so.  I'm still kind of in the dark on this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be brought up to speed.  Like wrapped up like a douche?  Oh.  Oh, there you go. 
[02:18:00]  Something like that.  It's douche.  It's douche.  Oh, God.  All right, whatever.  Blinded by the light.  Manfred Band.  Yeah.  The Earth Band.  Right.  So what are you guys doing for the big weekend?  None of your fucking business.  How about that?  Barracuda.  This fits.  There you go.  Why?  Because it's a barracuda.  The car.  The barracuda.  I swear to God.  All these years I thought it was about the fish.  Well, I don't know what it's about.  I think it's about the fish.  But even if it is about the fish, it's the name of the car, so it would fit the general. 
[02:18:30]  But is it about the fish or the car?  Oh, the great ladies of Rock and Roll Weekend.  The great ladies of Rock and Roll Weekend?  Yeah, we salute ladies.  Who's doing that?  Anna and Nancy Wilson.  Well, you can.  You usually do that on Mother's Day.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I salute the great ladies of Rock and Roll.  Uh-huh.  There's like five of them.  Everybody from Sherwood Crow to, you know, the Ronettes, everybody in between.  How many muscle car songs could you possibly have?  I can't even think of one.  It's a song about a Chevelle.  Hey, give us some muscle car songs.  GTO? 
[02:19:00]  I was kind of stumped when they told us about this.  Maybe play some BTO in place of a GTO.  Rocking down the highway.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, so you could do the highway songs.  Could do that.  Yeah, that's cheating, I think.  Nobody going to take my car.  I think that's cheating.  And drive it to the sky.  A little deep purple.  Taking it to the streets.  Taking it to the streets, doobies.  That's cheating.  How about the cars?  On the muscle car weekend, you've got to have songs about cars, not the highways.  Play some golden earring.  Yeah, there you go.  Radar love.  Radar love.  See, what we're doing now is we're brainstorming. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See, what happens when you have meetings.  Oh, God.  God, thank God.  He tells me this is just storming.  That just reminded us why we don't have meetings.  This is nonsense.  No, it's good to kick around the ideas.  Highway Star, that's a good one.  Yeah.  But they're not muscle cars.  No.  It's all about the highway.  Well, it's good driving songs, too.  It's about Tom, uh, uh, uh, uh, what, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, life is a highway.  Life is a highway.  Well, that wouldn't be on the 70s. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  Let's say that again.  Uh, Tom Cochran.  Tom Cochran, right.  I don't get it.  It's just not enough specific music.  How do they explain the muscle car weekend on the website?  Yeah, yeah, tell us.  They don't.  Ha, ha, ha.  There's no mention of it.  Well, I'm going to have to go up to the program director, Human Newman, and talk to him.  This is a good one.  Human Newman?  Yeah.  Who's that?  He's the program director of 70s on 70s.  Ah, how do I know that name?  Crank it up, B-Rod.  C-100.  Crank it up.  Two dollars less David than Haggis.  Leap it up. 
[02:20:30]  Loving fire.  Season is the wrong of the man you're at.  Yeah.  All right, that's good.  Thanks.  You hear it, right?  Every time.  I hear it loud.  I hear it in my own head when the music isn't even playing.  Yeah, to every song.  Florentine kind of dispelled that rumor, didn't he?  I guess, but who's that?  What does he know about me?  He's a metal magician.  I mean, he's a lawist.  What? It's not that at all.  He wouldn't say something like that. 
[02:21:00]  Why hide it?  It's stupid.  I don't get it. Why would he do it?  It doesn't make sense.  They don't like being cute.  I love Florentine's take on things like fantasy movies and video games.  It's just not real. It's stupid to even want to do that.  I'm not a child.  Yeah, I'm not a child.  I'm going to watch the Hobbit movies.  We asked him about ketchup because I'm not nine years old. 
[02:21:30]  Who says that?  He's hilarious.  My son likes ketchup. He's three.  He's three, but I'm not nine.  He doesn't like ketchup on hamburgers.  He is so fucking funny to listen to when he's going off on those.  Jim, you want some ketchup? No.  No.  My son likes ketchup. He's three.  It's the abruptness.  It's the irrational finality.  I love it.  Of his statements.  It's very funny.  And he hits you with a why.  Why?  Are you like chocolate?  No.  Why?  I liked it when I was six. 
[02:22:00]  Right.  Star Wars never saw one of them.  Don't care.  It's not real.  It's fake.  Muscle Car Weekend.  What else is going on around the old satellite radio dial?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Let's be company guys.  There's a lot of stuff out there.  All you have to do is check out SiriusXM.com.  No, I'm not checking.  No one's checking that out.  You have to.  We want to hear from you.  It's easier to send people right to the website.  We'd rather just hear.  What are some of the themes these channels are doing for the big Fourth of July weekend?  What's the 80s channel doing, maybe? 
[02:22:30]  Probably countdowns.  A lot of great summer countdowns.  I think that's really what it is.  I think as long as you play the music from the summertime, people relive the great summers  of their lives.  Oh, is that what it is?  It's depressing.  You know.  I get depressed when I think it's stuff like that.  All that time that's gone by.  Really?  Living great summers of our lives.  Remember when you were putting lotion on the beach in 75?  The guy's got wrinkled skin now, and he's fucking looking at his wife.  Been trying to push it on the steps for 13 years.  Put on life insurance. 
[02:23:00]  Let's think of that.  Summertime 1964, you had so much happening.  You know, the British Invasion, the Beach Boys, the Motown sound.  So if you went to high school or you graduated college then, those were your songs.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's 50 years ago, too.  Wow.  Yeah.  And it's always great to have stagers, too.  Huh?  1964.  Oh, what the?  It's called a stager?  Stager.  What is that, where they have little news clips and stuff?  Yeah, then you drop in a little...  And then the old TV dial.  And then you hear some, like, all-in-the-family clip or something. 
[02:23:30]  This is one far, small step for man.  Boy, the way Glenn Miller.  Yeah.  Ronan Martin's laughing.  What's wrong with the good stager?  Denny was all excited.  He wanted me to continue.  Yeah, I mean, you know, you listen to the 90s channel, they'll put a little Seinfeld clip on there.  Oh, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  But that's not a stager.  But he's...  Let's try to relate.  Let me see what he did again.  The Seinfeld thing.  He's very needy. 
[02:24:00]  What's wrong with the Seinfeld thing?  I know he likes...  He wants to relate to everybody.  I've mentioned it a few times.  Hey, a good plug for you.  Yesterday, I was driving home from Jersey on Friday in the afternoon, and I had the radio on.  And you know when you have that reverb like it's playing somewhere else?  I pull up to a guy next to me, and he's listening to Sam's show.  Wow.  He was a radio, yeah.  With the Raptor on a telephone pole, hopefully.  And they were playing an Opie and Anthony cut.  Wow.  And I turned to the guy, and we were this close, and traffic was at a crawl, so I said,  Oh, hey, oh, hey.  So the guy goes, yeah.  So he goes, what about Sam? 
[02:24:30]  I go, ah, not so much.  Oh, Denny.  Shit.  I said, good show.  Just wanted to give Sam a plug.  Wow.  Did you let the guy know that you could blow yourself?  No.  That thing come up in the discussion?  You can do that.  You should have told him you were Denny Falcone.  No.  No, no.  Why wouldn't you tell him you were Denny Falcone?  That's ridiculous.  The Denny Falcone.  That's stupid.  I just wanted to, and I told Sam yesterday, I said I was very proud to.  That's nice.  What do you think of Alan Hunter?  The VJ?  Yeah.  He does a nice job on the radio.  He's always. 
[02:25:00]  What does he do that makes it a nice job?  He was a good VJ.  You know, it was kind of relaxing.  They were all just our friends back then, weren't they?  I like Mark.  I always see Mark in the holes here.  Oh, sure.  He's pressing that button, turning on the radio so everybody could hear it.  He's stealing.  He's stealing content.  Yeah, we always plug that.  Hey, can you do that?  I don't know.  Can you pee in your own mouth like the rugby guy?  He's a big cockhead, that guy.  We always give a plug that if you have a Sirius XM radio that's not turned on, Mark will come over and turn it on for you. 
[02:25:30]  Look at his mushroom head.  What do you think?  He's a big cockhead.  Are you impressed by that, Denny?  Not at all.  The people want to know, is the Tinkle Lord impressed?  Oh, I forgot you're the Tinkle Lord.  No, I'm not.  It's hard to remember you as the Tinkle Lord.  No, I'm not.  I'm just Denny the 70s menace.  That's what I like to be known as.  All right.  70s menace.  Thank you, Sam.  It's hard to remember that you're also the Tinkle Lord.  I come in here and I say something nice about you and you have to throw this up.  I say something nice about you.  I pay you a compliment.  It's really hard to remember that you're also the Tinkle Lord.  And this is where you have to go.  Tinkle Lord is a compliment. 
[02:26:00]  Tinkle Lord is trying to be nice.  Just try to be nice to this guy who's going to throw this up.  Big cockhead.  Do you have a big cockhead?  You got a big mushroom head?  Are you guys done with me?  Because I do have some serious work to do.  I'm going to say no.  I'm going to say Denny's a five guy.  Is this a little too blue for you?  I just don't work this way.  You don't work this way?  No.  What about songs that have the word blue in them?  Like Blue Moo and the Marcells.  Say, there you go.  We're back on track.  We're back on track.  Blue on Blue.  A little slow dance with Bobby Vinton.  How about Blue Monday?  Blue Monday, New Order.  That's right. 
[02:26:30]  Very good.  Back in the big 80s.  What about I Don't Like Monday?  Oh, I don't.  Oh, fuck.  How about Blue himself?  Blue, blue, blue, blue.  Teddy blows himself.  Blue, blue, blue.  I blew myself.  White Moon Weekend.  That's another one we could do on Philadelphia July.  Songs with, you know, the colors.  Red.  Oh.  Red Skies at Night, The Fix.  You like that one?  See, now he's trying to relate to this.  Right.  What about White?  White?  White Wedding.  White Wedding.  Let's go to White Wedding.  White Power by Panzerfaust. 
[02:27:00]  And blue.  White Room Queen.  Ah, there you go.  Knights in White Satin.  Is that a song?  Oh, sure.  Pretty good.  What's your number one blue song?  Number one blue song.  Blue, blue, blue.  I like that.  The one he was playing is great.  Marcells.  There's this famous Elvis Presley song.  Blue Suede Shoes, my friend.  Well, the original was Carl Perkins.  Huh?  The original was Carl Perkins.  Who cares about Carl Perkins?  But wouldn't that be the number one blue song?  Blue Suede Shoes?  What's the number one white song?  I'd probably go with White Wedding. 
[02:27:30]  I think you'd add.  Number one white song?  The house next door to me was sold.  White Room, we've said that.  White Room would be the number one white song.  White Room, okay.  It depends.  It depends on what genre and who you're asking.  And then number one red song.  Red.  Red.  Red Barchetta?  Rush?  I gotta go Red Skies over Red Barchetta.  Yeah.  Little Red Corvette.  Very good.  Oh, that's a big hit right there.  Sammy, not bringing too much to your table.  Red.  Oh, shit. 
[02:28:00]  99 Luck Balloon.  Oh, Little Red Corvette.  You said that?  I didn't hear you.  But we're going to slow things down and ask you to grab your lady and bring her out to  the floor.  The lady in red.  Chris DeBerg.  It's great.  She's got a fucking period.  Drag her out by the tampon and smack her in the face with it in front of everyone for  shaming you.  What was Chris DeBerg's other song?  Oh.  Something about, like, crossing the river. 
[02:28:30]  It wasn't Don't Pay the Ferryman.  Very good.  Yes, yes.  You can't fix a price.  Is that crossing the river sticks?  He'll finger you on the other side.  Sticks?  The river sticks.  I don't know.  I tell you, this is fun.  Red, red wine.  I'll say this is a good song.  Red, red wine.  You'll be 40.  You'll be 40, yes.  Originally done, though, by Neil Diamond.  Ah, that is true.  He wrote that, yes.  Yes, he did.  Do you like this song?  No.  It's a nice song.  If she has red on.  Yeah.  It really limits when you can play this for a chick. 
[02:29:00]  She has a red shirt.  You're like, all right.  Anyone say red, red rain?  What is that?  Peter Gabriel?  Red.  Not a big hit.  Not on the hard drive of hits.  I'm sorry.  Give me some red rain.  Red rain.  No?  Crystal, we go back to blue.  Crystal blue persuasion.  No, we're not going back to blue.  We're not playing a board game.  Came into my mind.  Tommy James of the Shondells.  Let's see, red.  I'll tell you, we're, uh... 
[02:29:30]  This was fun.  What are you talking about?  Red rain.  I know it, but...  This is red rain?  Yeah.  Not really.  I don't know it.  You gotta know this song.  Peter Gabriel is just a little too odd.  Yeah.  I don't like Peter Gabriel.  For me.  It's funny.  No.  No.  Don't remember this one.  Sledgehammer in your eyes when I think of Peter Gabriel.  You don't know this song?  Really?  No.  You guys really don't know this song?  No. 
[02:30:00]  I'm crossing into the alternative world here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Teddy.  Oh, God.  Your appearances suck.  How about a red hat for Berkowitz?  Oh, nice.  How about red roses for a blue lady?  Oh, that covers both of them.  Yes.  Ah.  Very good.  I love Naina.  You like Naina?  Yeah.  She has no ass on her.  Oh, no.  Is it bad?  Her video is terrible. 
[02:30:30]  She's wearing those tight leather pants.  Oh, no.  And her ass is flat.  Oh, no.  I know.  Because she was very cute and everything.  Maybe she put two Luftballons in her fucking pants.  She probably should have.  Yeah.  Make a butt.  99 Luftballons and two flat ones.  Why do they have to release this in German, too?  Because she was German.  Wasn't that the original?  It was German first.  It was German version first.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Something at a coffee table and laying under it. 
[02:31:00]  Thread balloons.  They're brown.  She's trying to go back and forth.  She's even trying to stick her ass.  There's nothing there.  You see how she's pushing her ass out to make it look like she has more ass?  Yeah.  There's no ass on her.  Wow.  Wow.  There's a war going on.  I get it.  Yes.  Bunch of Luftballons.  Luftballons.  Luftballons.  Luftballons.  Stop saying it.  A bunch of Luftballons.  Yes.  That's it.  99 Luftballons.  Now she's doing her. 
[02:31:30]  I got a pee dance.  That's 49 Happy Lemon in one set.  Jesus.  I love the outdoor music videos where they would stand there and play in a field.  Yeah.  Not plug in anywhere.  A lot of smoke in the smoke machine.  Look.  There's no ass on her.  I don't remember.  It was.  Did they ever have another hit?  Disappointing.  Nina?  Yeah.  I think so.  Yes.  I like that. 
[02:32:00]  I like that.  The German version is better.  Big explosions going on.  Remember this one was heavy rotation on MTV for a while.  What year is this?  Like 85?  84?  Oh, man.  Before that.  Somewhere around there.  Yeah.  I think it was maybe even earlier than 84.  I used to play this all the time when I was the DJ at Houlihan's restaurants.  Jesus.  That's why.  Yeah.  Back in the 80s.  I love that.  He gets so excited.  I love his quips.  It brings them back.  Used to get in 9 o'clock at night and call tables for a while. 
[02:32:30]  Okay.  We have a table for two.  The Kumia party is now.  Oh, and then I'd come in and go, oh, I can't wait until the music starts.  Yes.  It's probably a table for one.  Yeah.  You had to work in Houlihan's and DJ every weekend?  Yeah.  He used to DJ on Thursday night.  It was ladies night and the feeling's right.  Cool and the gang.  He used to play with the ladies night.  Did he like it?  Thursday night we'd play.  I used to love it.  It was a celebration.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  A big party song.  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  You can't start the party without a celebration.  Sure.  Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday night.  I played that during miscarriages. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, God.  Nice DJ back in the days when the drinking age was still 18.  Fascinating, Dad.  Fascinating.  Isn't that great?  Ladies night.  Good song.  Ow.  Yeah.  It's great.  Richard Speck's Ferris.  Oh, yeah.  This is a boogie down.  Ladies night, two for one drink specials. 
[02:33:30]  Great.  Right.  Who didn't like a ladies night at Houlihan's?  Yeah, exactly.  Houlihan's.  Picture of fucking Loretta Swift.  She was Maggie.  Yeah.  I would drink at Clingers.  He's 80 years old today, by the way.  Who?  Is he?  Jamie Farr.  Jamie Farr.  Jamie Farr.  Jamie Farr.  Her name is Jamie.  Oh.  Keep an eye on him.  He was in Blackboard Jungle.  Was he?  One of the students.  I don't see him on our birthday list for today.  I heard it on the way in. 
[02:34:00]  I do on my prep sheets.  I have it there.  Yeah.  My show prep sheets.  You're prepping for a show that's not happening.  No, I just like to go through the review sheets so you know.  We do no prep, obviously.  And he does prep for a show that he's never going to do.  He preps for a show every day.  Back on this day, 1979.  What invention?  I wish it was.  Fax machine.  You're plugged.  Clubs.  Kenny, is that your technique?  I would say he's Sony Walkman.  Very good. 
[02:34:30]  It's a guy sucking his own dick well.  Very good.  Kenny, is that how you do it?  Do you hold your legs?  Do you make your mixtapes?  What is it?  This.  It's a guy sucking his own.  Certainly is.  Do you pin your own legs back like that to get that last inch?  He's just finished.  He's just finished.  I just want to know your technique.  That's all.  And then we can move on, finally.  Which technique do you think he does?  Do you think he grabs his own legs and pins them?  That's a pretty good one because you've got the legs.  They won't get in the way.  And you could get an extra inch in, probably. 
[02:35:00]  I think this bit has run its course, my friend.  What bit?  You in general or just the...  He's definitely run its course.  Mars loves the pictures, though.  I tell you, look at that.  Mars fucking takes selfies like that.  Mars, you all right over there?  I love him, man.  You love Danny?  I love Danny, too.  I actually do like you on the radio.  As much as I beat the shit out of you.  That's okay.  It's all fun.  How about that?  Nah, you can't do that.  That's for the young right there.  Sucking your own cock is for the young.  Absolutely.  No, that technique is for the young. 
[02:35:30]  What, the one foot up on the turlet?  Sitting up.  I don't know.  This guy's just pissing into his own mouth.  That's a good one, too.  It is, right, Danny?  I wouldn't know.  I'm sorry.  It's a big story.  The rugby player, that's all.  Yes.  Enjoy.  Hey, go America's Cup.  There's Luff Ballon in his mouth.  World Cup, America's Cup.  Luff Ballon.  I love a good Luff Ballon.  Great code name for something.  Danny, how can we capitalize as radio DJs as far as the World Cup goes? 
[02:36:00]  Soccer fever has hit America.  You guys really jumped on the bandwagon for that, huh?  We sure did.  Yeah, we did.  But what can we do?  Is there soccer songs, maybe?  Or maybe patriotic songs we could play?  I gave E-Rock the Pitbull and Jennifer Lopez song for the World Cup.  What the fuck is that?  Yeah, it's a good song.  Did you play it?  Yeah, they were the opening act.  They're doing Ole Ole.  Well, the original one came out in the 80s.  Oh. 
[02:36:30]  The soccer song.  Pitbull.  Pitbull's hot.  He's very good.  He sucks.  He's a young man, too.  He has a hell of a career ahead of him, this Pitbull.  Oh, Jesus.  This is horrible.  Listen to me.  This sucks.  You don't like this?  No.  I've heard better Ole songs.  Yes.  J-Lo.  Whatever.  Jenny from the Block. 
[02:37:00]  I do like that one.  That's it.  It smells like every car I fucking pull up next to that I want to fire in through the window.  Cars hit the boom.  It's so unreasonable.  It really is.  You think?  I don't know what they're singing about. 
[02:37:30]  Mundo, the world.  Puto.  Puto.  Thank you.  Puto.  How many years of Spanish?  Six.  I'm proud of it.  I'd rather listen to a little Freddy Fender.  Before the next teardrop falls?  Sure.  I like that one.  Classic.  Very good song.  All right. 
[02:38:00]  Do we have to look at this?  No, you don't know.  I was just saying.  We're really...  I think they let America win, by the way.  Like, push through the...  Just to keep the interest going.  And then today, everyone's heart will be broken.  They might let them pass this one, too.  They might let them get past Belgium.  Yeah.  We'll see.  Oh, there's the baseball-sized hell again.  I do like that shimmy.  Look at the damage the baseball-sized hell did.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Baseball-sized hell.  Do you think the soccer league wants America to do well? 
[02:38:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, they're making a fortune.  What other fucking savage country that plays soccer  sells this many t-shirts and jerseys?  We're a big, consuming country.  Just ask the consumer.  Right in that room there.  They are loving the fact that all their FIFA...  Their FIFA...  Their FIFA goods...  All of their FIFA trademarked goods are being fucking sold.  Is it official FIFA wear?  Only you sell the official FIFA.  You got to have an official FIFA...  Do you guys play soccer? 
[02:39:00]  Official FIFA.  Yeah.  What?  Did you guys play soccer?  Yeah, it's a goof.  I played seven years.  I mean, you know, in the suburbs, it's...  High school college.  It's massive.  Of course it's massive.  Because of soccer moms, they call them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because every parent thinks their kid is going to get into college on a scholarship.  A soccer scholarship?  Did this happen?  I played for seven years, but never was...  Travel soccer.  It's very big.  You move to the suburbs, you'll see.  You'll be out there Saturday mornings with those kids playing soccer. 
[02:39:30]  My brother runs his soccer league.  Does he?  Does he?  What?  He's the commissioner.  Oh, no.  He's an asshole about it.  I love it.  The commissioner.  He's tough.  He's not taking any guff from anyone.  He's a tight ship.  Yeah, he does.  He really does.  Holy God.  Do you like that soccer movie with Will Ferrell?  Not as much as I like that.  Take a look, Danny.  Is that more your style?  That was a funny movie.  Is that more your style right there?  Just be honest.  Oh, Jesus.  Just look, please.  I don't need to look because that does not interest me. 
[02:40:00]  It's not his style, I guess.  He does it a different way.  No?  Yeah.  He's got, like, the whole helmet in his mouth.  Just came in here to say hi and bring some gifts and some merriment and a smile.  You've delivered.  You have delivered.  Danny.  I think this is our last live show.  Really?  Ever.  Well.  Well, ever would be nice.  No, I don't say that.  I don't say that.  That is a nice place to work.  It's not really.  I like it.  I wouldn't want to live here.  Ooh.  I like this. 
[02:40:30]  I like this room.  I like the people in it.  Oh.  But this isn't a nice place to work.  Stop it.  Adding a diddle of the asshole.  That is weird.  I don't like his hair.  His dick sucking.  His hair is awful.  No?  Yeah, it's straight.  Freaky hair.  Do you diddle your own asshole?  It's a grape look to him.  It's a Gilbert.  Gilbert, I said.  It's a Hitler out of the shower.  Gilbert.  What the hell is that?  I really enjoyed this, aren't you?  It's terrific.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Liberty Hartness, yes.  What the hell is that?  What is that?  Liberty Hartness, a delightful young woman. 
[02:41:00]  Well, the young woman is sucking her own dick.  Well, you know.  Does that happen?  Some women do gymnastics.  We got a hurricane coming, really?  Well, no.  It's a low-pressure system.  I hear it's going to turn into a little hurricane off the coast of D.C.  Hurricane Arthur.  Arthur?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  It's not like a drunkenly...  He played a nice song by Christopher Cross.  Ah, there it is. 
[02:41:30]  Boy, what a plus T was.  It was a good song.  Christopher Cross was a major bust in music.  It was a great album.  My first album.  He came out of nowhere, and he was huge.  He won a bunch of Grammys, and then no one heard from him ever again.  Best New Artist.  Yeah.  All that shit.  That's usually a kiss of death.  Although, Cindy Lauper won Best New Artist, and she was able to continue.  It's like winning an Oscar when you're too young, like Timothy Hutton.  I think A Taste of Honey won Best New Artist, too, in 1978.  Let me see the video.  Yeah, this one.  Oogie, oogie, oogie. 
[02:42:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Wait, that's not the video.  It's a song.  Oh.  That's a guy squatting with his shorts pulled down and boots on, and he's easily sucking  his own cock because it's 30 inches long.  Easily.  Easily.  It's like Steve C.  Yes.  Yeah, he's easily sucking his own cock.  With no effort.  No.  No, he's got a neck brace on, and he's still pulling it off.  Mr. Brady in court.  He's got one of those things you put on a dog when you fix him, and he's still able to.  Yeah, fucking the cone. 
[02:42:30]  Yes.  The cone over the head.  Dan, you've got to respect that.  You've got to respect what this man is getting done.  Yeah, just think of it out of respect.  Yeah.  Tasting his own prey.  In New York City.  How do you get caught between the moon and New York City?  No, I never understood this.  It's in space.  That means you've got to be in a tree or something.  How about you?  Equidistant?  It's in space.  One of those great Burt Bacharach compositions. 
[02:43:00]  Ah, yes.  And his wife at the time, Carol Bayer-Sager.  They did the music.  Yeah.  Ride Like the Wind is a great song.  Good driving song.  Good tune.  Good tune.  Good tune.  I like Sailing, too.  It's a nice, relaxing song.  Sailing, take me away.  Right, that one?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think so.  I was watching Arthur recently.  That was a good, the original.  It was a really good movie.  Mark has a theory why Christopher Cross never really made it.  Let's go to Mark in Austin.  Go ahead.  Good morning, bu-bu-bu-boy. 
[02:43:30]  Hey.  Christopher Cross was ugly as fuck.  He was like a bald-headed weirdo looking dude.  And when MTV came out, nobody wanted to look at his ugly fucking face.  So he took the bed and nobody heard from him.  There's something to be said about that.  A little Milli Vanilli action.  You have to have good looks if you want to make it in pop music, especially.  What's what Christopher Cross looks like?  I don't remember.  Punch it out.  Yeah, he had all sorts of problems.  Did he do nothing after the first album?  Nothing.  He was thinning. 
[02:44:00]  Follow-up, yeah.  Think of Laura.  Remember that?  All right.  Oh, boy, yeah.  Oh, man.  That's a more recent picture, though.  He's got a problem.  Who does he look like?  He does look familiar.  Oh, the guy who was in that TV show, The Commish?  Yeah, a little bit like him, but I'm thinking of someone else.  It's like the Swish Commish.  Oh, am I looking like him?  We got you again.  I'm playing along.  There's a guy, yeah.  Oh, now you're playing along?  I'm playing along.  Oh, you're playing along.  You're working blue with us.  It's a black guy sucking his own dick.  Then he's finally working blue. 
[02:44:30]  Do whatever you want.  All right, cool.  Then he's finally working blue.  Tell me what.  You think he's going to get street cred from doing that?  Sam enjoys finding pictures of this on the internet.  Oh, good way to turn it around.  That's a good way to turn it around.  Is that getting respect right there?  A little respect?  Yo, respect.  I don't think he's getting street cred.  What was the guy's name that was next to you in the car?  I don't know.  He might be on the line.  Oh, he just hung up.  Forget it.  Never mind.  Why do these guys hang up just as we're going to them?  I don't understand that.  All right, Danny. 
[02:45:00]  You were terrific.  Thanks for giving Jimmy his beach ball music.  Wouldn't it be nice?  Of course, one of the greatest love songs of all time, God Only Knows.  It's a nice song.  All right, we're going to go to break with where I'd like to win, because people really want  to hear this, okay?  Once you're talking up, talk it up.  Talk it up.  It's a great song.  Boy, I tell you, you've got to add this to your CD collection, one of those greatest  albums of all time, along with the Hootie and the Blowfish album right there on the  shelf, but Christopher Cross, not a good-looking guy, but a great voice, and a song written  by Anthony? 
[02:45:30]  No, Anthony didn't write it.  And his wife at the time.  Some ho.  Mrs. Backlash.  Turn it up, comb your hair, and ride.  Oh, God.  My body's weak.  My body's weak.  I'm on the run.  No time to sleep.  I've got to ride.  Ride like the wind.  To be free again.  And I've got such a long way to go.  Such a long way to go.  To make it to the border of Mexico.

I want to get some snapshots of her.  She enters.  Are you really?  I love this cocaine in a fucking house.  It doesn't have to be with Lady Di.  Oh, what?  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  What's going on there?  Wow.  That is some blue hair.  You got the blue hair.  Is it like...  It needed the money. 
[03:03:00]  Is it your 4th of July look?  Blue hair.  You got the red hat.  Hey, Mike.  We'll use the microphone.  Go on.  No, I wore this on America's Got Talent with Nick Cannon, and so I figured it's lucky,  and I wore it yesterday in Times Square.  Right.  I'm not allowed to say anything, right?  Oh, that's okay.  Okay.  No, because me and Jim did...  You know, he was so great.  He was in Times Square for his brand new show, The Jim Norton Fucking Show.  He doesn't know what you're talking about.  Fucking Jim Fuck Fuck. 
[03:03:30]  Norton Fuck.  So all the kids were out, man.  I'm going to sing, right?  Man, all the fucking kiddies, man.  Fuck.  Fuck.  And it was a great little...  You know, they filmed me and everything.  So after you left, Jim...  Do you mind that she's talking about it?  No, it's okay.  The guy that sells tickets for tours, he's like, hey, man, you're doing videos now, huh?  You're getting up there.  What are you wearing, patchouli?  Yeah. 
[03:04:00]  You can smell it.  Yeah.  My pussy.  Would you like to smell it?  I'm wearing a new perfume.  I thought it was weed at first.  A lot of times I can fuse patchouli with people that smoke weed.  Right.  Well, they go together.  It's kind of got the same kind of...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm wearing a new perfume.  It's called Come To You.  Come To You.  Would you like to smell it?  No, thanks.  Does it smell like come to you?  Oh, my God.  I understand.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Hey, hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, baby, bitch. 
[03:04:30]  So, I'm so excited to be here.  Hold on.  I got a couple things.  Sandy was in the hall saying she was getting herself horny.  Really?  Why are we getting horny in the hallway?  Well, I just wanted to say this, man.  I hope you don't take it personally, Anthony.  We'll try not to.  But, you know, as much as I love both you guys, right?  Nice.  I have a hard-on for both of you for years.  Sure, sure.  So, in fact, my song for you guys used to be Can't Get Enough of Your Love Baby.  Right.  Uh-huh.  Is it on the new CD?  No.  Fuck.  You know, my CD is my own songs. 
[03:05:00]  I didn't write that one.  Sure.  But, anyway, I did this show the last time, and I had a sex dream about Anthony.  Oh, right.  Wow.  What did you do in the dream?  Was it a good one?  Well, you were, like, laying over here, and...  Yeah?  How had I died?  No, it was just...  It was, like, more like a blow-me type of dream, like you were laying back and...  You were eating your pussy, Ed.  Oh.  Nice.  And it was a big bulge in your pants. 
[03:05:30]  You're a lucky man.  Wow.  Big bulge in my pants.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  So, and then we were in my kitchen.  Wait, was he eating your pussy?  Uh-huh.  No, he wanted me to blow him.  Of course.  Of course.  No, it was almost like...  I'm not crazy.  It was almost like a David Brenner.  Blow me, but I'm not going to blow you.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, so...  Wait, David Brenner you blew?  Yeah, I blew David Brenner.  How was it?  He had the smallest dick I ever saw in my life.  Really?  Poor guy's dead.  He can't even defend himself.  Yeah, I know.  Hey, but, you know, he did. 
[03:06:00]  So, tall men usually have smaller dicks.  Oh, yeah?  You didn't know that?  Is it perspective, though?  Huh?  Is it perspective because they're tall, so it looks like it's smaller, or is it actually  a small dick?  I think that it's really...  The smallest dick I ever blew was a Jewish guy, and he was about 6'2", and he had like  a baby cock.  A baby.  And I felt sorry for him.  Yeah.  But, um, what can I do?  There's nothing...  You know, some guys have small cocks, but it doesn't really matter to a woman like people 
[03:06:30]  think.  Right.  I don't think so.  If you love someone, you love what they have.  If you love someone...  You know, I mean, as long as they have a long tongue.  All right.  Because, you know, women like oral sex.  What about the sex dream with Anthony?  Did he, uh...  Oh, thanks for bringing that back around.  Yeah, yeah, right.  It was a big bulge.  Did he eat your pussy?  It was a big bulge in his pants, and he, like, was letting him back, and it was like,  blow me.  Yeah.  Right.  I'm very demanding like that.  Yeah.  Well, well...  Say that.  Blow me.  Did you blow him?  Did you blow him?  Did you blow him in the dream? 
[03:07:00]  No, I didn't.  Oh, man.  I'm being honest.  I could say it, guys.  I could make something wrong.  Yeah, we don't want you making shit out.  Get a big cock, and I sniffed his asshole, too.  Right.  But, you know, he would be the type that probably want you to.  Blow me and then sniff my ass.  Bye.  That's what David Brenner...  I was spit...  True story.  I was spitting David Brenner's cum out in the sink.  And I heard the door slam.  What a great way to start a story. 
[03:07:30]  He didn't even say goodbye.  Wait, you were still spitting cum out in the door slam?  I was spitting his kind.  Didn't Jewish girls don't swallow.  As much as I loved them.  That's hilarious.  And then I heard the door slam.  You did.  He didn't even say goodbye.  Wow.  That's the greatest quote ever.  Where did this go down?  Huh?  Where did it go down?  In a green room?  Where did it go down?  A hotel?  Yeah.  No, my apartment.  He came over?  Yeah, I was working with him at the improv.  Sorry, Sandy.  I gotta go.  No, he didn't say it.  I gotta go.  You just came in your mouth.  He didn't even say it. 
[03:08:00]  He didn't even say it.  That's the beauty of it.  He just left.  He just slammed the door.  Spit my cum out.  I'm spitting it out.  And he had a small dick, but he came a lot.  And this is all coming back to me.  And I'm spitting it out, and the door slams.  I said, wow.  Came a lot.  But I still loved him anyway.  What, did you see him at the improv that I said?  Yeah.  I saw him at the improv.  I wanted to be with him again, and he wouldn't be with me.  Oh, man.  To be honest, a long time ago. 
[03:08:30]  Why didn't he fuck you?  Oh, yeah.  It was like, what, 80, 1980?  Why didn't he fuck me?  Yeah.  He just didn't.  And I was, you know, I'm like.  Do you get high?  Do I get high?  Yeah.  Do I?  Yeah.  What's wrong with it?  Yeah.  It's gonna be legal everywhere within the next few years.  You know, I gotta be honest.  For three weeks, I have to.  It's funny you ask me that, but I.  I see it in your eyes.  It almost looks like you might have.  No.  Nothing today?  For three weeks.  Why?  Oh, you're on medication? 
[03:09:00]  Because, you know, the reason, I think that my eyes might be glassy, because a lot of,  you know, I wear eyeliner a lot, because I wanted to be with better people.  So, yeah, I don't want to be with pushers and dealers, and so I feel, the reason I'm here  is because three weeks ago, I stopped smoking pot.  Oh.  So you were smoking a lot?  Um, not that much, but enough, you know, but I think you always overdo it. 
[03:09:30]  It's like, if you have cookies in the house, you're gonna eat them.  Right.  If you have cocaine in the house, you're gonna snort it.  Right.  If David Brenner's in your house, you're gonna.  You're gonna suck his dick.  Suck his dick and take his comb.  Suck his dick, but not eat it.  But, you know, he was a great, great man, I gotta say.  Right.  He was a great, I loved him very much.  He was, he helped me.  But as I was spitting David Brenner's come out in the sink, I heard the door slam.  That's my favorite sentence ever.  Oh, it's great.  No, but it was a two-story.  Not the opening line of Tale of Two Cities.  Yeah.  Tale of Two Titties. 
[03:10:00]  He didn't, you know, he didn't even, he didn't even address me.  I mean, he didn't care.  I just wanted to get a blowjob.  He just wanted to come.  Yeah.  He just pulled his dick out and you sucked for that.  Yeah, yeah.  And well, we kept smoking cigarettes.  He used to smoke Newports.  Yeah.  Smoking, smoking.  Well, he said, then he says, well, no, he folded his arms and said, well, what are  we going to do about this?  Like, let's get rolling here.  I'm not here for entertainment.  Yeah, yeah, hello, I'm out of cigarettes. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  Blow me.  But, yeah, it ain't who you know, it's who you blow.  There you go.  Well, what about the Gward thing?  What?  Have you always been a Gward person?  A what?  God.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you talked about Joel on the phone.  Oh, Joel Osteen.  What a great pastor.  But have you always been religious?  He passed up.  No, I met Jesus in Nashville.  You met Jesus in Nashville.  I met Jesus in Nashville.  You're a Jewish girl from New York, though.  Right.  I was very Orthodox Jewish. 
[03:11:00]  You know, everyone was Jewish in my neighborhood.  So when it became the song, I went to Nashville, and it's called The Bible Belt, and it really  is.  So I was trying to sell a song, and this woman said, you don't know Jesus, Sandy?  They, you don't know, you never met Jesus?  Uh-oh.  So I said, um.  I blew him once.  Yeah.  Did he have a big dick?  Yeah.  As Judas was spitting my cum out of the sick.  He had a big cock.  Did you ever do that?  Do you ever, like, look at Jesus and say, how big is his dick? 
[03:11:30]  Who was under the table at the Last Supper?  Yeah.  Jesus was humble.  He probably gave himself six.  Yeah.  He didn't get out.  No, he didn't get out.  No, he didn't get out.  No, he didn't get out.  No, he didn't get out.  No, he didn't get out of his own cock.  Oh, come on.  But, uh, but anyway.  Hold on.  You were Orthodox Jewish?  Hardcore?  Well, hardcore, like, everyone was, I have a song on my cassette.  Oh.  Oh.  It was, everyone was Jewish in Newark, the butcher, the baker, even the shoemaker.  So I didn't meet a Jew until I left home.  I thought Gentile was a floor covering. 
[03:12:00]  But, um.  Oh, look out.  No, but, so, no, so I went to Nashville when I was, like, about 30, and there I saw, um,  I met this woman.  She said, you don't know Jesus?  She closed, this is how religious, she closed her office and went and bought me a Bible.  Really?  I never bought the song, no.  So it's like I met Jesus for the first time, but she never bought the song.  Did you read the Bible?  No, I didn't.  There you go.  I don't understand the Bible.  Do you?  I don't either.  This one begat, that one, that one begat, that one begat, begat, begat. 
[03:12:30]  It starts off a little slow.  Yeah.  I don't understand the Bible, but I read the Daily Word.  What's the Daily Word?  You never heard of the Daily Word?  No, it is.  Enlighten us.  It's like every day there's a message.  Mine is.  From God.  I use it every day, whether I need to or not.  You never heard of the Daily Word?  Only when they cut me off in traffic.  I found my first Daily Word at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  It's a great little Bible, and it really, you know, like says... 
[03:13:00]  But what is it?  It's an easier Bible to read?  Yes.  Okay.  It's a pop-up.  Every day has a different message.  Crucifixion is a depressing pop-up.  I love a good pop-up book.  Me too.  Pop-up Bible to Crucifixion.  Yeah, he's on his cross.  He's just lugging it.  You know, it's a very good book, man, and it really is very positive.  Sometimes you can be depressed.  Do you ever get depressed, you guys?  No.  Do we ever not?  Oh, please.  Yeah, I know.  Opie, you're amazing.  Thank you.  I remember you said that to me.  I said, how do you get up every fucking morning and be snow, snow, sleet? 
[03:13:30]  You guys are fucking there, man.  Yeah, we are.  And I was like, how the fuck do they do it?  And you said, I love this job.  Well, there you go.  That must have been 12 years ago.  No, that was about a few weeks ago.  Oh, wow, really?  I love this job, and it comes back to me.  That's why I want to be more productive like you guys.  You get depressed, Sandy.  Huh?  You get depressed a lot.  Oh, yeah.  How do you take care of your depression?  Well, in the morning, besides having a cup of coffee, maybe the daily word. 
[03:14:00]  Sheba.  Okay, the daily word.  Yeah, I should.  And that helps.  Yeah, I should get you back.  What did you learn today from the daily word?  It's July 1st.  Like the jumble.  So optimism is the word.  Optimism.  Optimism.  Optimism.  It just says, you know, think positive.  And even when it's cloudy, the sun is shining.  Yeah, above the clouds.  So I was about to buy some marijuana, and then the Jim Norton show called.  I just want you to know, that was God. 
[03:14:30]  I feel, you know, this woman in Nashville said to me, what is God when certain things happen?  So I called my dealer, Melvin.  I said, Melvin, man, you know, hey, I need some shit.  You're the last bastion of the old New York, man.  Melvin.  Fucking right.  Melvin.  The last one.  Yeah, literally.  And so then the Jim Norton show called, and I said, hey, Melvin, I could forget about it.  Now, there's a drug dealer named Melvin looking to kill me.  Yeah, yeah.  He cost him some fucking. 
[03:15:00]  Melvin, so, you know, I just, you know, I really want to.  Where's Melvin's cell?  A little of everything.  He's, no, no, he don't sell hard drugs.  Just weed?  Yeah, but, you know, weed is still a drug.  It's still a drug.  It's legal in L.A.  It's legal in L.A.  Not really.  Yes, it is.  It's decriminalized.  I mean, medical marijuana.  No, please, you go for a sore toe, and you get it.  You got your Colorado that's legal there.  No, but I'm just, but the thing is, you have to go to a doctor. 
[03:15:30]  Washington?  And, you know, Washington State.  You open up the L.A. Weekly, and there's doctors, doctors, you know, you just go, you  pay a few dollars, you pay $70.  What if you open it up strong?  I even, no, the doctor that I saw, he said, oh, I smoke.  Minute by, minute by, minute by.  Everyone smokes.  I mean, but, you know, I'm glad in the way it's not legal in New York, because sometimes,  you know, you really say, hey, I don't want to be addicted to anything.  Right.  What about love?  You want to be addicted?  Package youth. 
[03:16:00]  Well, you know, I love O.A. because.  Do you want to be addicted to love?  No.  And you know what?  In the morning when I turn on the radio, you guys are there.  Wow.  So I listen, I go, who the fuck did I have on today?  And it's not me, I know.  And then Jim is funny.  And, you know, so you guys really perk people up in the morning.  And you're also like, you're there.  Yeah, we're here.  That's what, uh, that's what our slug line is.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, we're here.  It may not be shit, but we're here. 
[03:16:30]  Right.  And that is so important.  Oh, apparently it is.  99% of life is showing up.  My friend told me that many of you.  I know.  I mean, Jim is like the epitome of showing up.  But how do you show up?  And, um, so now you have the, your own, the whole station, right?  You have the whole.  What happened?  206.  We've had it for a while.  Oh, yeah.  You have.  Enough about us, though.  Yeah, we're great.  We're, we're, we're, you know.  No, but hey, me as a fan.  Enough about us.  Let's talk about you.  I'm not only someone that's been on your show, but I'm a fucking fan. 
[03:17:00]  So you say, how do you clear your depression up?  You say, well, they're there.  Let me, you know, you know, we could, you know.  The Daily Word.  Let's talk about your new CD.  Okay, hello.  The Naked Cowgirl.  I love Nick.  I have a problem with the cover.  You're using, like, pictures of the old judges on a new CD.  What's going on with that?  Because, obviously, America's got talent.  Well, that was the judges when, um.  Oh, when you were on the show?  Yes.  Oh.  Stupid me.  That makes sense.  I thought you were on the show with the new judges, or they brought you back, no?  Um, no, they didn't.  They brought me back, um, I was in New York with Nick Cannon, and then I was on the All-Star 
[03:17:30]  show, and they flew me to L.A.  You were on with the new judges last year, no?  No, two years ago.  I thought it was the new ones, too.  I thought it was the new ones.  No.  No.  I wasn't.  I was on season six.  But the song just came out.  I love Nick.  All right.  In one week, oh, it was, uh, and Anthony and Jim.  Um, it, like, it got, it has the 18th station.  I have the, the national, um, you know.  Oh, let me take a look at it.  Oh.  So I got this for you guys. 
[03:18:00]  Wow.  Let me look at this.  Seriously.  Let me look at it.  Okay.  Seriously.  Hey.  Come around.  It's a fucking world.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's sporting the leather pants, too.  It's working all the fucking way.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  Yeah.  Let me see this.  It's working.  And, you know.  This is the numbers for the new song.  National record promotion.  Naked Cowgirl.  I love Nick.  Second most added on AC, AC 40.  She's got real radio stations.  Come on.  Hello.  Uh, number 13 on AC 40, Indie Chart, NMW, I guess. 
[03:18:30]  Fifth most added on FMQB.  What?  You know it?  Yeah.  Friday Morning Quarterback.  Number 40 on AC 40, Main Chart, Debut.  A lot of the same NMW, though.  It's a new music weekly.  I'm going to have it.  And all these stations are playing it?  18 in, like, a week.  She ain't fucking around.  How about that?  The song has kind of taken off a little bit for you.  Oh, man.  She's, uh...  Katy Perry, Lady Gaga.  All right. 
[03:19:00]  Get back on mic.  Yeah, they can't hear you, Sammy.  Lady Gaga, bitch.  Damn.  I'm bad.  You're charting.  Yeah, baby.  And he said, you know, I'm working with this guy, Larry Weir, at Heartland.  Larry Weir.  Larry Weir.  I remember that last time.  Fucking Larry fucking Weir.  What was his name in the fucking voice?  Brett Weir.  Leary.  Leary.  I said, I'm Leary.  Oh.  And so he's in Heartland Entertainment out in L.A.  And, um, you know, it was like... 
[03:19:30]  Jesus.  You got real numbers here.  Hello.  It's about fucking time.  Wow.  I'm not going to bore the audience with it, but I see here you're on all sorts of charts  across America.  Yes, I love Nick.  Good for you.  He's sweeter than ice cream on a stick.  So, um...  Should we play it right now?  Just like Stairway to Heaven.  It was I Love Dick in Germany, and then they stood me next to Nick Cannon.  I said, who the fuck is this, right?  I never even heard of Nick Cannon, but it was like, Nick!  See, that's how shit happens.  Yeah, so of all people, they stood him next to me, and I said, hey, instead of Dick, I'll 
[03:20:00]  have Nick.  So, um, I said, who the fuck is he?  He said, well, he's married to Mariah Carey.  I said, oh, okay.  I like the backstory.  So, yeah, what?  It is terrific.  No, I don't.  I love your dick, by the way.  Let's see.  Oh, no.  I'm not supporting really anything right now.  It was...  Nah.  Right now, it's just...  Not for me, baby.  It's just kind of, you know...  You got to be 16 to get his, uh, dick horn.  Oh, holy shit.  Right?  Or is it 18 now?  It's two years later.  I got a half a Cialis rod, for some reason. 
[03:20:30]  I get them all the time.  What?  You get a big dick?  No, it's not.  You get a big dick, a big dick.  But so is Dick, and then it turns to Nick.  And, and, you know, I mean, and...  All right.  Let's play the song.  Can we play the song?  Let's hear a little of the, uh, song.  Who's that the cane song?  Professionally produced, finally.  Well, I'm in the charts.  He's sweeter than ice cream on a stick.  I love Nick. 
[03:21:00]  I love Nick.  He is the ice cream that I love to lick.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  He's sweeter than ice cream on a stick.  Yeah, yeah.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  He is the ice cream I love to lick.  Nick is my boyfriend, yeah.  Nick is the love of my life.  God would bless me if Nick made me his wife, yeah. 
[03:21:30]  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  He's sweeter than ice cream on a stick.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  He is the ice cream that I love to lick.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  He's sweeter than ice cream on a stick.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  He's sweeter than ice cream on a stick. 
[03:22:00]  Nick is my boyfriend, and I'm writing him this song, I'm writing him this song to tell him the song.  I love Nick, I love Nick, he's sweet or that ice cream on a stick.  I love Nick, I love Nick, he is the ice cream that I love to leave.  I love you Nick, I love you Nick, vanilla, chocolate, strawberry too, oh Nick, my boyfriend, I'm still so in love with you, cause you are so sexy and you are so hot, yeah boy you hit my heart, I have chocolate, butter pecan, you are so sexy and you are such a man, I love you Nick.

Oh, well made out.  Yeah.  That's, uh, well produced, finally.  I would like the vocals to have been a little louder actually, I think it was good though, but I would like to have heard your vocals a little better. 
[03:24:00]  Let me tell you, to be honest, I don't want to, I shouldn't say it, don't put yourself down, but that has no harmony, no, they took the steel guitar.  Don't you worry.  Because, you know, it was produced in Nashville.  The magic on that tape is yours.  That's right.  Yeah.  You know, you own the magic.  It's like an old school song, like a fifties love song almost.  It did, it sounded like one of those fifties.  Yeah, it was like, you know, I mean, I think it's all about oral sex, you're sweeter, you suck a dick instead of eating pistachio. 
[03:24:30]  And you know, and you swallow cum and spit it out in the sink.  No, don't you think that sex can be a substitution for food?  Feel, feel, feel, feel me heat.  Don't you think?  And I go like a lot of nuts songs with nuts, because men and penis and nuts.  Right, it all goes together.  You know, butter if you can, maple, walnut, you know, pistachio.  I eat a cucumber with two little tomatoes on the side.  Right, that's what I'm saying.  You don't think that sex and food are very synonymous? 
[03:25:00]  Oh, please.  No?  That's sex bagel.  They are.  And then...  Sex and bagel.  Sex and bagel, you put a, you dicking a bagel?  Could do that.  Okay.  Depends, then.  Let's get the reviews.  I think people really enjoy this song.  Ah, the reviews are flying in.  They are.  Let's say hi to John in New York.  John!  Smash or trash?  John, there's a room in this place named after you.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  What range you have?  Hold on.  Hold on, hold on, she can't hear you, John.

You know what I mean?  It's okay.  There's a certain genre.  Are you not American?  Yeah, I guess John's a communist. 
[03:26:00]  My ex-husband is named John.  I was married for seven years.  Hello?  When were you married?  Well, I was a common law.  What?  But he had a big dick.  Why'd you go common law?  Well, because I was with him seven years.  There's no common law in New York.  Yeah.  Back in the day, maybe.  Well, I thought that-  I think your headphones were on wrong.  Ah.  The other ear is off.  Yeah.  Why can't people figure that out?  Oh, no.  They can never figure that out.  Here it is.  Oh, no.  John, you fuck.  Now I'm going to get all frustrated. 
[03:26:30]  Fuck you.  No, turn that.  That way.  No, no.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, oh, okay.  There you go.  All right.  So, wait.  Where'd you live?  Um, I lived right where I, uh, blew David Brenner on 55th Street and 8th Avenue.  Yeah, they renamed it.  Renamed the street.  It's Cum Street.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There is a Dick Street in L.A., but, um, is John still here?  No.  No, we got another guy.  All right.  Let's play Smasher Trash. 
[03:27:00]  Let's get, uh, Dr. X on.  He's calling from Mexico City.  That's pretty cool.  Yay!  Mexico City.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.

You lived here for seven years.  Why'd you break up?  Why did I break up?  Because it was time, you know? 
[03:27:30]  I get like, you know, if I left him, someone else knew would come, but no one ever really did.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  You know, sometimes...  I don't know.  What year was that?  A long time, baby.  I think Sandy Kane wants a little love in her life.  Hey.  You would like a little love in your life.  You know, I would like...  Now that you found the Jesus and you're not smoking the weed.  Yeah.  Well, I would like a hit record, you know, so I mean, I just...  Are you lonely?  I'm lonely for a fucking hit, you know?  If it ain't a hit, it ain't worth shit.  Fuck.  Fuck. 
[03:28:00]  You know, I'm just saying, it could be a million...  I got a lot of t-shirts to make.  Yeah, yeah.  If it ain't a hit, and I have a song, if it ain't a hit, it ain't worth shit.  Right.  And you know, you could write a million songs, but what...  If it ain't a hit, it ain't worth shit.  It's cool.  That's exactly the song.  I would assume it always, you know, kind of follows that theme.  If it ain't a hit, it ain't worth shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  Alright, let's...  Let's play Smasher Trash, okay?  Okay.  Alright, we got Big Hoss on from Iowa. 
[03:28:30]  Big Hoss.  Big Hoss.  Yes.  Ugh, she is fucking terrible.  What?  Sounds like a fucking mentally retarded kid singing to Nick Cannon.  Wait.  Oh, man.  Why don't you like it?  Yeah.  Ugh, you sing the same fucking line six dozen times.  Right, you're right, but you know...  It's sketchy.  It's sketchy.  He's saying there's not much, you know, change in the lyrics.  Yeah, well, you know, people like that shit. 
[03:29:00]  You know, you go, I love Nick, I love Nick, the ice cream on a stick, the favorite flavor,  ice cream, and then it just goes, I love Nick, I love Nick again, and then the favorite flavor,  ice cream, my favorite ice cream.  I love Nick, I love Nick again, and then...  No, you're so hot, you hit my fucking G-spot.  Yeah, that's in there.  That's in there.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, you hit my vanilla chocolate butter pecan, you are so sexy and you're such a fucking  man.  Wow.  All right. 
[03:29:30]  See, now she's breaking it down.  What's wrong with you, big hoss?  There you go.  Ugh, she needs to buy a pen, I got a paper.  It's just like yesterday, all my trouble seems so far away.  Right.  And it looks as though they're here to stay while I believe in yesterday.  Yeah, hello.  Sure, I hear you.  I love Nick, I love Nick.  Nick, I love Nick.  Nick, I love him.  Right, right, it's the same.  I love Nick.  It's just words when you really think about it.  All right, let's move on.  I don't think big hoss is in a good mood today.  Okay.  Let's keep it positive.  Dan in Pennsylvania, Dan.  All right, yeah, I hope Sandy Kane gets hit by a bus. 
[03:30:00]  What?  God forbid.  See, hello.  It's out there in Times Square where the cars don't go, so she's safe.  Yeah, she's charting.  No, this car's there.  Oh, yeah.  The bitch is charting.  She's charting across America with this song.  She's terrible.  Every song sounds like the same generic cut.  It's just terrible.  There's no other words.  Not really.  Anthony just broke it down.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  He's sweet.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  My favorite ice cream. 
[03:30:30]  A lick or something.  I want to lick him.  A lick.  Stick.  Dick.  The only thing I hope she ends up making love to is a bullet.  Come punch me.  Wow.  What the fuck?  Sandy, don't pay attention to these people.  They're haters.  She's a God-fearing woman.  Why would you say that?  Do you have a tissue?  Tissue?  I don't even know your-  All right.  You know what?  They're haters, Sandy.  Oh, man.  They love, they hate.  Mike in Illinois.  Mike.  Yeah.  I figured out Sandy Kane's husband is the guy from the crazy house and says, I hate this 
[03:31:00]  place.  I've been here for seven years.  Oh, boy.  Seven years.  That wasn't very good, sir.  I thought you were going to call up and ask Sandy Kane and then you sound like an idiot.  Greg in Boston.  Greg.  What do you say, fellas?  Hey, buddy.  I think this is a trash Sandy Kane is better off singing into the business end of a shotgun.  Wow.  That's helpful.  All these people, man.  Why do you say that?  But the good news, they heard it in Boston today. 
[03:31:30]  That's kind of cool.  See?  That's true.  They did?  LA Radio does.  Oh, great.  Love everywhere.  Great deal.  Great.  Thank you, Nick.  Every city you could imagine.  Oh, and you played the whole song.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Because we didn't want to get sued again.  July 1st.  Wonderful.  July 1st, man.  July 1st, man.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.

There it is.  Wow.  Yay.  God, her boobs are like playing.  Oh, she almost fell.  Her boobs are like playing with Mercury.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You see that?  Yeah, they're just kind of teetering on the top.  She was wiggling and they were smelling over the top. 
[03:35:00]  Surface tensions holding them into her brassiere.  Very good.  You got two plays on the song.  Hallelujah.  That is God.  They just heard that in L.A.  Thank you.  And Canada.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Larry, we love you, bitch.  I love you, Leary.  How much money are you making off the song?  You win.  Nada.  It costs me.  I'm losing.  You're losing money on the big hit?  Nothing on this earth.  Well, hey, Mitch.  Or beyond.  It's just our two weeks, O.P.  You're losing money on your big song. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, well, hey, I'm not like you guys.  You make money.  But at least God provides.  You know, I got money.  Shit.  I go out there, shake my titties and my fucking asshole.  Wow.  You shake your asshole?  She sounded like Mr. Haney there.  I shake my titties and my asshole.  I shake my fucking titties.  And how much do you pull in, would you say?  Enough to support yourself?  You doing all right?  Hall of fucking Louie. 
[03:36:00]  All right.  It beats fucking five guys in upper Manhattan on cocaine, all right?  Oh.  Wait, what happened with the five guys?  You tell that story?  The gangbang.  All right.  The famous gangbang.  Oh.  Yeah, it was really good.  It was really good.  I enjoyed it.  Not many women are going to say it was really good.  I enjoyed it.  These great guys.  That's a while ago, right?  Yeah, well.  What's the story?  They hired you?  They will.  Yeah, well, I was working at a place called the John Carr Bar.  Dykeman and Nagel, Upper Manhattan. 
[03:36:30]  Nagel.  Nagel.  What's up, Nagel?  Oh, man.  The old days.  Dykeman and they'd still be at Dykeman.  What kind of street was that besides one without a gym on it?  Well, you know, you still can buy cocaine up there.  So, anyway, so, you know, they're like Takedo Mucho.  So, I'm drinking like my Kahluas and milk and there's...  What year was this?  Bring us back.  Was it old school New York?  Definitely.  Like when?  But it's still there, man.  Takedo Mucho, man. 
[03:37:00]  Those, you know, Latin men will spend their last dollar to get...  What year, though?  Yeah, baby, I don't remember of those.  Oh, baby.  Nice.  It's a gangbang.  You should probably pencil it in somewhere.  Yeah, man.  You'd think you'd remember that.  So, I made money that night and I fucked five guys.  They were the nicest guys.  So, after the job, they took me to this apartment and we, you know, one right after another was  good cocaine.  Uh-huh.  I used to do drugs in the 90s. 
[03:37:30]  Now, I do them in any temperature.  But...  Oh, my God.  You know, I mean, it was really a hot night, you know?  Yeah.  So, anyway...  Were you sucking a dick and getting fucked at the same time or did they do it all like  separate?  No, I was like a very Jewish hooker.  I would just lay down and let them, you know...  So, it was a train more than a gangbang?  I'm lucky I don't have AIDS and died.  So, I'm lucky I died.  Did you suck any of their penises?  Still time.  Nah.  Nah.  I just suck dick.  For only David Brenner. 
[03:38:00]  No, I mean, I only...  You know, my Bible was like, I can only suck a guy I love.  But, you know, just to lay back and just get a guy's dick in me, it was like easy, really.  You open your legs and, you know...  Come on, listen up, girls.  Got some advice.  How old were you when you lost your virginity?  I was with this guy, Morty Wachanski from Elizabeth, New Jersey.  Morty Wachanski from Elizabeth, New Jersey. 
[03:38:30]  And I remember him saying, hey, you know, I think I broke your cherry.  I saw blood on the sheets.  So, I mean, that...  I said, this is it?  What year was it?  I mean, how old were you?  How old were you?  Can you keep a secret?  Yeah.  That's mine.  Oh!  You got you.  She got you.  How old were you when it happened, though?  About 18.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  It was about 18, 19.  And I said, wow, what a...  You know, I didn't even know my cherry was broken. 
[03:39:00]  He told me that there was blood on the sheets and it wasn't my period.  The lady in red.  For him, it was like cutting the ribbon to the marathon.  Yeah, he was like, yay, baby, I did it to the bitch.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so, it was, you know...  But, you know, life keeps coming and going and you got...  You know, nothing stays the same but change.  Um...  That's pretty deep.  Isn't it?  I know.  That was deep.  Dick Sean.  Oh, he fucked you, too.  Yeah. 
[03:39:30]  He was good.  He liked Damien Nightmares.  I know, just talking about...  I loved Damien Nightmares.  Well, we were just talking about the comedy cellar the other night.  Robert Wohl was there talking about Dick Sean.  Really?  Wow, what did he say?  He was very funny.  He liked him a lot.  Robert Wohl.  Yeah, he liked Dick Sean a lot.  Brilliant, man.  And he fucked you a lot?  Yeah.  But he liked Damien Nightmares when he came.  He just, like, you want some?  No, no, no.  He would do poppers when he came?  Yeah.  How would he come?  He would just come.  No, no, no.  But from what were you doing when he would come? 
[03:40:00]  Uh, good question.  I forgot.  We were on peyote buttons.  Did you ever do peyote?  Hell no.  Peyote?  No.  Peyote buttons.  No, no, no.  No.  So you would do peyote and he would do fucking poppers and fuck?  No, but he would also do peyote.  We had peyote buttons.  Tell us about those.  Those Indians would go out and do that shit out in the desert and get all fucked up.  Yeah, tell us about it.  Poyote buttons.  What does it make you feel like?  Stop saying it.  And angel dust was, like, incredible, man.  So it was just dust and poppers? 
[03:40:30]  Wow, you did a lot of drugs.  I didn't do dust.  You did angel dust?  Yes.  Fuck.  In L.A.  Did you want to jump off the roof or anything, like they say?  No, it was a great drug for sex.  I was a fucking guy named Jimmy Calvert.  He was a guitar player.  And it was a great sex drug.  A cavalcade of stars.  Yeah, right.  He was a great, you know.  What was Dick Sean doing?  He was just doing the amuletrics?  Yeah, he was, you know, I forgot what he was.  He was a crazy guy.  No other drugs, though?  Yeah, marijuana.  Yeah, marijuana. 
[03:41:00]  He was into everything.  Would they take your asshole, too?  Would they take your ass?  He would dance around in his underwear.  You know, Dick Sean would be dancing around.  He was like a dancer.  And we had stoned on pot and shit.  What else?  And then...  Peyote buttons?  Tell us about the peyote buttons.  What does it do to you?  What does it do to you?  It looks like a button with your shit in it.  Peyote.  Peyote buttons.  What kind of buzz did you get?  What kind of a trip did you get? 
[03:41:30]  It was good, man.  Did you hallucinate?  LSD, you know, whatever.  Yeah, it was good.  We were fucked up, man.  And then, you know, when he came, he would just open one of those up and say, you want  some?  And thank God I didn't take him.  Hey, I don't want to get greedy.  Thank God I didn't take that.  He never...  Fuck, the Angel Dust drug.  Right, right.  I'll take that, right?  The Angel Dust, great fuck drug.  Great fuck drug.  Uh-huh.  What does that make you feel like?  I don't...  I don't like sexual intercourse.  What?  I like oral sex. 
[03:42:00]  Uh-huh.  So men, most men don't do it.  Well, you got one of those small vaginas.  Does it go in too far?  Hurt you?  What do you got going on?  I don't...  I just never got...  I never got satisfaction from a dick in my twat.  But on Angel Dust, I did.  I mean, it was like me and this guy, Jimmy, had a big dick.  He was an Indian.  Really?  Yes, he was an Indian.  He was an Apache.  Did he give you an orgasm and then take it back? 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  He smothered over the pillow afterwards.  No, I don't know.  It was just good.  We got someone that wants to give you some advice.  We got some advice for you.  Yes, Baker in Baton Rouge.  Go ahead, Baker.  Yeah.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Hey, good.  Good.  Sandy?  Yeah.  Hey, it's not peyote.  It's peyote.  Ah.  Dumb ass.  Okay.  Dumb ass.  Okay, I'm not... 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  Well, I didn't know that.  Yeah, come on.  Well, yeah, you did.  You had to.  I did, baby.  What the fuck?  Get off the PCP and the peyote and maybe you'll know how to pronounce it later on.  Oh, wow.  I think you'd be a little nitpicky, sir.  Right?  You'd be a little nitpicky.  This is peyote.  I heard peyote.  She's our friend.  Peyote.  Peyote.  What the fuck is the difference, man?  I heard peyote.  Do they still even have that drug?  Tomato, tomato.  Hello?  Which drug?  Peyote, peyote, fuck.  Peyote, peyote. 
[03:43:30]  No, it's peyote.  Peyote.  Peyote.  Okay.  Did you ever do it, Jim?  No.  No, never?  Why?  Were you drug-free?  I am now, but I just never did it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I know it's...  I only did it really once.  The angel dust is what's...  It's a trippy mushroom.  That was...  Angel dust is really a good fuck drug.  Oh, it was a good fuck drug.  What does it make you feel like?  Well, I know.  Anyone in this room?  I used to see God.  I used to see God on angel dust.  I used to be like, God.  What is angel dust, though?  Whenever someone fucking breaks handcuffs or hits eight cops with a fucking shovel. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, it's always angel dust.  Angel dust, right.  Really?  It's scary.  Yeah, it makes you powerful.  I think you roll it up or something.  And, you know, at one point that was a big...  You're supposed to smoke it with some weed.  I got dusty.  Right.  Okay.  I got dusted.  I got dusted.  You got dusted.  Yeah, that's what it's called.  No, it's dusted.

Yeah, let's do that.  Yeah.  Hold on.  One more call before we go to break.  A very positive call coming in.  For real.  Robert Reed, you're on...  Let's end this on a positive note.  Tom in Massachusetts.  I hope you assholes realize what you've done.  What?  That stupid song is going to be stuck in my head for the next week.

The guy that made my guitar and said, I think he was a good guy.  Yeah, but it was an old guitar, right?  And you got good money for it.  We're over the guitar thing, aren't we?  No.  People are so wise.  Even the guy that we did the Jim Norton show.  Can you do this live read for me?  Me?  Yeah. 
[03:53:00]  Sure.  It would be my honor.  Or my pleasure, or whatever.  One of those things.  Radio in the fucking house, man.  Radio.  Yeah, do it good, though.  Oh, thank you.

I'm a professional.  Let's do radio together.  Let's do this.  Okay, great.  I love it, man.  I love radio.  This summer, check out USA Network's new original drama series. 
[03:53:30]  Rush.  About a good doctor with a few bad habits.  Hey, Tom Ellis stars as renegade physician Dr. William P. Rush.  Rush examines the world of Dr. William P. Rush, a medical fixer who's always on call.  He's the breast doctor in town, but his personal life could use some help.  Breast.  I couldn't, you know, I don't, who's couldn't? 
[03:54:00]  He privately caters to the rich and powerful of Los Angeles.  Really?  Which includes celebrities in trouble, athletes with issues, and politicians with problems.  You name it, he'll name the price.  Though the hard-parting doctor claims that he doesn't make judgments about his less-than-squeaky-clean clients,  he is not immune to the ugliness he encounters.  His services and discretion are legendary, while the best-of-the-books medical care doesn't come cheap. 
[03:54:30]  He's definitely worth it.  He provides medical attention without all the attention.  Follow this show on Twitter at Rush on USA.  At Rush on USA.  Rush, anyway, a new original series premieres Thursday, July 17th at 9 p.m. Eastern, 8 p.m. Central, only on USA Networks.

And I'm telling you to train, say your prayers, and eat your vitamins, and listen to the O&A West Coast Encore. 
[03:55:30]  This is a really big radio show.  You should stay right here.  Stay right here.  At 11 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Pacific.  That's the way we do it in Venice Beach, brother.  Tune in with no expectations.  After 20 years of amazing people with their obscene ability to entertain on an unprecedented level,  it's about time Opie and Anthony were celebrating.  Combing through their 20-year history, this is an Opie and Anthony radio gem.  Big A was married. 
[03:56:00]  We find out was married.  Now this is very surprising.  How old were you when you were married?  Actually, I'm thinking.  I was trying.  Ballpark.  How old a gentleman are you now?  That's good.  40.  40?  Approximately how many years ago did you get married?  Let's get more comfortable.  Why don't you put your feet up?  Why don't you lean back? 
[03:56:30]  14.  Oh, that's a recliner.  All right.  So what?  14 years ago you were married?  Someone fixed the lumbar on it.  It's pushing his belly out.  Oh, it doesn't have one.  All right.  So around 26, you got married.  14 years ago, right?  How long were you married for?  About three years.  Three years?  Where did you meet the girl that you wound up marrying?  Up in Yonkers.  Okay, up in Yonkers.  And how did you first see her? 
[03:57:00]  She was working at a Burger King.  And you what?  Went there a lot or you worked there too?  Oh, no, I was a customer.  Okay.  And she'd give you like an extra hat?  A little Burger King crown.  So she worked at Burger King.  And what did she do there?  She was just a cash register girl?  I think she worked in the back.  So how did you finally meet her? 
[03:57:30]  She took a break.  And you duct taped her mouth shut and threw her in the trunk of your car.  You rolled her up in some indoor-outdoor carpeting.  What'd she look like, by the way?  Oh.  Here's a little description of her.  Good question.  Color hair?  Dark.  Dark hair.  All right, wait, wait.  Was everything dark on her?  Oh, wait a minute. 
[03:58:00]  Was she an African-American?  No.  No?  She was from Trinidad.  Oh, so she was an African Trinidadian.  The man don't say a word quickly.  The man say S-T words too slowly.  Him go S-T, S-T, S-T, and nothing come out after.  The man's balls smell like Elizabeth, New Jersey. 
[03:58:30]  I'm going to try to put it in the backside.  It won't even hurt.  I'm going to try to shit on it to discourage him.  I'm always wearing the Burger King crown, trying to recapture the magic.  I'm not amused by this bit at all.  No, he's not.  I'm not happy at all.  I can't talk to him on the phone. 
[03:59:00]  My whole phone card is no good no more because him trying to say stairs.  I'm at the point and go to the upsy things.  I'm so stupid, we asked him to carry what we told him was domino sugar in his backside.  And him did it in balloons.  The only reason she accepted an ass-fucking from you, Big A, was just to, you know, stretch out her assholes.  Yeah. 
[03:59:30]  You'll pack more drugs.  But I'm not well-endowed enough to stretch it out.  Me could only put back two sprinkles of coca.  Not even enough to get high on.  It melted in me asshole in the airport.  Me wasn't happy with the size of his penis.  I had to start seeing a five-year-old in the neighborhood to make it up.  The man always getting stopped by customs because him can't talk right.  They think he hiding something.  Me put the progeria curse on him penis. 
[04:00:00]  He wanted to put it in the backside.  He's going to wake up with a surprise.  I roll the bones.  Make the small dick.  I make a fat doll and I put pins in it.  Him have shoes like fat muffins.  The police showed up.  I thought it was Mr. Met.  Oh, Xbox One now starts at $3.99 and brings together the best exclusive games,

[04:01:30]  You can put your penis away, miss.  So what's Dick first?  Huh?  Dick.  Dick.  Dick left a bad taste in my mouth.  I love Dick.  I love Dick.  You see?  I have red ice cream on a stick.  Ah, is that me?  It's Michael McDonald.  That's how he would sing it.  I love it, man.  Minute by minute by minute. 
[04:02:00]  Um.  Ah.  Ah.  I'm a-oh.  I'm a-oh.  Shine a light on me.  Eh-eh.  I love Dick.  Ah.  I got it.  Ah.  I got great news.  Ah.  In a little while, we're going to step aside because we found an old, uh, what, Patrice  O'Neal World Cup bit?  Oh, a World Cup bit.  So we're going to play that today.  Great.  Because we have to get into a meeting, like, we're supposed to be in the meeting now, but...  Lickety split.  But he could wait.  Lickety split.  Because we have a little more radio to do. 
[04:02:30]  We're supposed to be down the hall by 10.  Uh-oh.  Not our doing.  That's the time that was scheduled for this meeting with some guy named Scott.  Oh, yeah.  But before that, we have Sandy Kane in the studio, and, um...  Ah.  She's got a brand new song.  This is breaking news.  She does.  She's working on it.  Oh.  I remember she got arrested by the NYPD.  Oh, I thought it was...  Oh, by the way, the sergeant is, um, you know, he said to me, hey, what are you doing O.P.  Anthony?  We remember this story.  So... 
[04:03:00]  No, there's a game.  Hey, I heard that story.  No, but he was with...  Sure.  Again.  I ain't no band leader.  Hey, honey, he was with this woman.  He was hanging out.  I was hanging out with my titties out on, um, 45th Street and Broadway.  Really?  You know, just making money, you know, taking pictures of people.  So, here he was.  Dietrich was in the car with a female officer just sitting there, and he said to me, um,  hey, what are you doing O.P. and Anthony again?  I said, should I mention your name? 
[04:03:30]  He said, no, you better not.  He said, it's overkill.  But please do.  You know, I was like, he loves you guys.  Thank you.  And, uh, he heard the sound bites of what happened when I, when, um, I got arrested,  and I said, hey, of all people to arrest, with all the shit in Times Square, the guys  scamming CDs and the Asian guys.  And so he finally heard it, what I said, and he kind of felt guilty, he said.  But he says he likes to be the bad guy, but... 
[04:04:00]  You don't think those, uh, black guys selling the CDs are real?  Um, one of the guys that cleaned the shit, you know, those guys with the red outfits,  he said, a lot of, there's no, nothing on the CDs.  Wow, I never would have guessed that.  They look so reputable.  Yeah, yeah.  They look so reputable.  No, but they surround the guys, they surround the white guys.  Uh-huh, they intimidate them.  Yeah, they intimidate them, and the guys, and then, you know, a lot of times they just  throw them out.  They just don't want to get, don't you like black guys? 
[04:04:30]  Um, you know, they say, don't you like black people?  Ooh, so, um, they feel, you know, I don't see why white people are so guilty.  Not exactly, what's the problem?  You know, you're black, I'm white, who cares, you know, so give me the money.  And the guys with the, the Asian guys putting bracelets on people, and they make you sign  shit, you know, so, um...  What, what about the song?  Right.  Well, that's what we're getting at.  We were getting to the song part. 
[04:05:00]  Okay.  Yeah, we heard all that before.  Okay, so, um...  So now you're going to sing about your experience, right?  By the way, Vos got costed that trick in Harlem, to buy in the CD, the CD thing.  No way.  Yeah, he did.  Ugh.  He bought a CD in Harlem.  Who would fall for that?  I wouldn't.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Was there anything on it?  I can't.  Who listened?  I can't.  Who listened?  He left it in the parking garage.  Exactly.  Right.  It's pure intimidation.  Yo, yo, come here, come here.  And they get over, they surround you.  And if you're a tourist, and, you know, you're from the Midwest, and you've told your friends, 
[04:05:30]  like, oh, yeah, I'm going to New York City.  Oh, look out, look out, because everybody warns you.  And now you're surrounded by these intimidating-looking thugs.  Yeah.  And they're, you know, hey, buy this.  You're like, I better just fucking buy it.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like, they go like that, like, you know, and then they give them only a dollar  or two.  Come on, come on.  Come on.  This is me.  I signed it.  I signed it.  It's my music.  It's my work.  It's my music.  I was snapping pictures of them one day.  Oh, yeah.  And, yeah, the guy turned around and starts going, hey, what are you, hey, photographer, 
[04:06:00]  what are you taking pictures of?  Oh, God, really?  I'm like, nothing.  Just snapping pictures.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, you want a picture of me?  I'm like, sure, I'm taking pictures.  And he started, like, walking toward me.  And what did you do?  I just started taking pictures.  And he said something like, I'll call the cops.  And I started laughing.  Yeah, really?  And now the cops don't even do anything about this shit that goes on.  And that's what I said over the radio on Opie and Anthony.  They haven't done anything.  And he said, wow, you know, thanks for telling me the way he said it. 
[04:06:30]  Because after, like, Giuliani, when you have Bloomberg, and now especially de Blasio,  there's these quality of life things, they used to call it.  Quality of life crimes or incidents or violations.  And they don't pay attention to those anymore.  So the cops just walk around to make sure nobody's shooting or stabbing someone.  But for the most part, it's anything goes out there.  It's like Thunderdome out there.  There's fucking Elmo's molesting children.  There's thugs surrounding poor white people from fucking Oklahoma. 
[04:07:00]  Some drug dealing going on.  Drug dealing all the time.  But nothing, the cops can't do anything.  Why would the cops want to do anything when all they do is get shit on and accused of fucking all kinds of racial bullshit?  So they just walk around and, you know.  Take pictures with people.  That's it.  Take pictures.  They're celebrities.  When I was robbed three times, I was fucking naked, man, with pasties on. 
[04:07:30]  Everything was taken.  The cops did nothing.  The cops did fucking nothing.  Because what are they going to do?  Can we get to her song?  All right.  She's got an I Got Arrested by the NYPD song.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, too bad we don't.  You know, why don't you play something from the CD?  Oh, I got arrested.  In fact, I was.  You're working on it, you told me.  Yeah, okay.  It's a brand new song.  All right.  We're in progress.  Yeah.  And I sang it to D-Tricks.  Well, keep that in mind.  Just give us a couple lines from the song.  Yeah, I got arrested by the NYPD. 
[04:08:00]  Took away my guitar.  Threw me in the back of a fucking police car.  I got arrested by the fucking NYPD.  Oh, man.  Took away my freedom, my mobility.  Fucking the NYPD.  Hey, I got arrested by the fucking NYPD. 
[04:08:30]  Took away my freedom, my fucking mobility.  When I got, threw me in a car, a police car.  Took away my fucking guitar.  They handcuffed me, threw me in a fucking police car.  I mean, what the fuck?  When I got arrested.  Like that part.  This sounds just like a Michael McDonald song.  Oh, yeah. 
[04:09:00]  When I resisted, I protested.  I got arrested.  Arrested, protested.  Even though I protested.  Ooh, we went.  I got arrested by the fucking NYPD.  Why did you arrest me?  Oh.  That's going to be a hit.  That's the follow-up to I Love Nick.  If it ain't a hit, it ain't worth shit.  That's a good one.  That's like a follow-up to Fuck the Police.  I want to open it up with like a siren, a siren. 
[04:09:30]  Yeah, sure.  You should have one that goes beep, boop, beep.  Like you're in Europe.  Just so it could play internationally.  Right, right.  They can relate to that one.  Well, I told them, I'm the studio in Nashville.  I'll be there.  But, you know, there's another one on my CD called Don't Look Back.  Too bad we can't play it.  That is the point.  Why don't we play it for you?  We have to wrap up because we really...  Okay, Don't Look Back.  We really do have to get to a meeting.  I think you guys, it's a man's song. 
[04:10:00]  Yeah, Don't Look Back's not on the CD you get.  No, you don't have the other CD.  No, I really don't.  Sorry about that.  It's on iTunes.  Oh, we gave you a bunch of spins for I Love Nick.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I think we're good.  I don't think you need to sue us today.  That's good.  That's good news.  I'm a girl named Sue.  I can go home confident that you're not going to sue us.  Right.  No litigation in the near future.  Well, there is one dedicated to the naked cowboy.  Oh, shit.  We'll do that next time.  Because we...  Yeah, yeah.  We got a...  We actually do it.  We have a meeting.  Be careful what you say because he'll sue you, too.  Don't bend over on him. 
[04:10:30]  What's the big plug?  Because we really do have to go.  Okay, thank you so much.  We're late for this 10 o'clock meeting.  And, you know, the big plug is I Love Nick.  Okay.  Of course, I have my cable show every Saturday night.  Sure you do.  All right.  You know, we're filming in Times Square.  Of course.  And I was with Jim yesterday.  Really?  What do you think about that?  Filming in Times Square.  It was fun?  Yeah.  It was like...  It was nice, right?  Huh?  All right.  Jimmy's got plugs, too.  M&A every Saturday night, 11 p.m.  Perfect.  It's a pleasure seeing you, Santa King.  Oh, thank you.  God bless Opie and Anthony.  All right. 
[04:11:00]  The brass thing on radio.  They really are.  Oh, thank you.  No, and I'm not just kidding.  I listen, like you say.  Okay.  Jimmy, what do you got going on?  James Norton.  All right.  We got just a couple gigs.  West Palm Beach Improv, July 10th through 12th.  I've heard it sold out.  Oh, no.  Oh, July 26th.  Jesus Theater in Montreal, San Francisco, Cobbs, August 7th through 9th.  That one is almost sold out.  Nice.  I'm lying. 
[04:11:30]  And Dallas, Addison and Bob, August 21st.  That one's almost sold out.  I know you do well in Dallas.  I do very, very well in Dallas.  Okay.  Apparently not in the summer.  21, 22nd, 23rd.  Ah, great.  I miss going down to Dallas.  This week with James Norton.  All right.  What do we got, Sam?  A little Patrice O'Neal bit about the World Cup?  You got it.  Yeah?  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Well, you know, we got to step aside for more downtime. 
[04:12:00]  For more downtime.  We did two shows this week.  This schedule feels pretty nice.  Exhausted.  Yeah.  Okay.  Sure.  We'll do that.  Exactly.  So what am I doing?  Iraq's got it.  Let's throw it to it.  All right.  Throw it to Iraq.  Okay.  It's the best of Opie and Anthony.  You're not watching World Cup, are you?  You're not a World Cup guy.  I watched...  Are you taking a peek?  I watched Brazil and North Korea yesterday.  Your fucking tweet was hysterical. 
[04:12:30]  Yeah, I'm watching and I'm seeing the...  Who cares?  The soccer fans get mad when you talk like this.  Soccer, um...  I tweet soccer.  Soccer...  For some reason, I tapped into some really evil, angry motherfuckers.  Yeah.  One, hockey fans.  Hockey fans.  I went at it with them one night.  Oh, I saw your hockey battle.  Why'd you go out there with hockey guys?  I'm a hockey guy.  They said, fuck basketball, watch hockey.  So I said, fuck snow soccer, right? 
[04:13:00]  So...  That's funny.  That's funny.  I can't be mad at that.  That's funny.  I said the game is going to be half-half at halftime.  Like, that's the score.  Half-half.  Half-half.  Soccer...  Look, I have a friend.  Gavin from England.  He's got to love his soccer.  He loves soccer, right?  We was playing one day.  I had an Xbox soccer shit.  And I was...  You know, soccer.  So I'm beating him like 3-0 or something because I'm just playing like a girl plays. 
[04:13:30]  Just tapping anything?  He starts playing like you're supposed to and setting it up on the corner.  And then he started winning.  And I'm like, you know what?  Soccer still sucks.  It's like, no matter what you do, this country...  You know what?  Why doesn't football...  This is why these fucking boring sports...  Why is a touchdown six points with an extra point...  They could just make a touchdown one point. 
[04:14:00]  Yeah.  Why?  Because it fucking adds something to it when the score is 28-16.  Even though they only scored 16 points is three times.  Maybe five field goals or some shit.  Yeah, I got you.  But you know what I'm saying.  And it's a possibility.  Here's another thing.  They don't have to play to win.  It's not an I win sport.  It's a wow, watch the skill sport. 
[04:14:30]  But we're not playing around with that shit in this country, man.  We tried it for years.  See, there's the thing about soccer, folks, football.  America is a sports-loving country.  If it has a certain kind of value to it, we will fucking play it.  Because we sort of play soccer, but it's something about it that doesn't quench fucking that thirsty thing, man.  Any sport that girls can do as entertaining as men can't be respected. 
[04:15:00]  Wow.  Wow, you just fucking nailed it.  Because even basketball, they don't do as well as men.  No one gives a shit about the WNBA.  I think the championship game's tomorrow.  No one gives a fuck.  Are you kidding?  No, I'm not.  Exactly.  No one knows.  That league is about ready to go away, right?  Oh, yeah.  I think they're in deep trouble.  It's Nokia.  They're not even like the Los Angeles, this and it, or the Sacramento. 
[04:15:30]  It's the fucking Church's Chicken fucking Spurs now.  Like Bad News Bears is sponsored.  Yeah, they have sponsors now.  Yeah, she goes bail bonds.  Right.  Like fucking...  I didn't know that.  Yeah, like PokerChips.com is...  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because no one...  And here's the thing.  Girls are fantastic, man.  I love girls.  I love girls because they're girls.  If you play basketball in panties and the nipple was out or it just... 
[04:16:00]  You fucking eat each other's pussy at the front.  I'd watch it all day long.  But you're playing man shit with girl legs and bodies.  You're on a fast break by yourself.  All right.  Cindy got the ball.  No one's...  And she lays it up exactly the same way she would have if someone was there in front of her.  You're a girl.  You can't do any shit with it. 
[04:16:30]  They fucking suck.  You can't take off from the foul line.  They can't jump.  To a 360.  They can't run.  Here's what they should do.  Lower the rims.  Shorten the court.  To the...  You know where the men's court ends at half court?  That's where you put the other rim for the bitches.  So it moves faster.  They did make the ball smaller for them.  Because they're girls.  Stop trying to be dudes.  You fucking sit down and pee. 
[04:17:00]  I'm going to tell you.  Soccer.  You watch women's soccer?  Same excitement level as men's soccer.  Yeah.  It's not like you're watching...  Look.  And here's another thing about soccer.  Every...  Every...  There's a new best player in the world.  Every day.  There's a new Ronaldo.  That ain't the nigga from last week.  How'd they figure that out though?  If they're not scoring a lot.  That's what I'm saying.  I don't know how they figured that out.  Messi.  Messi.  What up?  Messi from Argentina. 
[04:17:30]  Best player in the world.  Really?  What happened to this other guy I got used to?  I thought he was the best player.  Ronaldinho was the best last week.  And then Cristiano was the best of the week.  And then Beckham was the best two years ago.  You...  What?  They changed the best to Oven.  There's ten motherfuckers.  They don't score.  And here's the problem with even the score.  Hockey finally figured it out.  I was watching...  Somebody talk about hockey.  They're trying to get it able...  You able to shoot more. 
[04:18:00]  Yeah.  Soccer is like...  Okay.  Oh, okay.  This fucking little Korean guy.  Oh, he went past him.  I didn't know.  He...  Oops.  No, the guy kicked the ball and that's it.  It ends in disappointment way too many times.  You don't even see a shot on the goal.  We did this earlier, Patrice.  The average soccer game, eight to ten shots on goal per team.  What?  Eight to ten shots.  Soccer fans...  And that's what?  Ninety minutes of action?  Stop being so protective and having an ownership. 
[04:18:30]  You know this football...  If you said to a football fan, hey man, football sucks.  They would go, wow.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Nice talking to you.  There's no argument.  Football doesn't suck.  He'd be like, I like it.  Football doesn't because even when things are going bad...  This is not arguing about rugby.  Rugby's a sport for men.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, but, it's a constant bunch of horse shit.  In football, here's how Americans make things make sense. 
[04:19:00]  It's rugby where I hit you, you run until I fucking stop you from running.  Mm-hmm.  You, I hit you and things are done.  Get up and try it again.  Rugby's like that?  No.  I know.  Rugby's...  Rugby's...  Yeah.  Scrums and this guy's flipping backwards and then a guy puts it and it never stops.  And it's, there's no projectile hitting.  There's no, you run as fast as you can and hit a motherfucker. 
[04:19:30]  And smash into somebody.  No.  That's what I'm saying.  They go soccer.  Do you know they can't barely...  I watched some of this shit.  They can't barely show a replay.  Because soccer don't stop.  It doesn't stop during time...  It doesn't...  The timeouts are not like, okay, huddle in this talk.  Yeah.  Timeouts happen.  You call this guy off.  He just runs off and another fucker runs on.  And they all look like they're doing the same fucking thing. 
[04:20:00]  We don't like it.  Listen, soccer fans.  We don't like it.  Stop forcing us to like it.  We don't...  We're not rooting for...  Here's how awful we...  We call it a victory that America tied England.  Nobody gives a fuck.  Big victory.  And why is the soccer field so large?  Why does it have to be that large?  And they make you tired.  They run too much.  What the fuck are you doing? 
[04:20:30]  These niggas...  It's just...  That's why we're talking about the dumb fucking horns so much.  There's nothing else to talk about in this world.  Exactly.  Stop the horns.  Anthony's got the app.  I got my app.  I got my app.  Get the fuck out of here.  The Babuzla app.  I got my Babuzla app.  What the fuck?  Oh, yeah.  This is like one of the top free apps out there right now.  People are digging this.  Oh, boy.  People are digging this out.  See, it's not working.  No, no, no.  It'll work.  It'll work.  No, no.  It'll work, I swear. 
[04:21:00]  No.  No, no.  I got the sound turned off.  Oh, okay.  There we go.  Go on!  Go on!  Go on!  Go on!  Go on!  And then, uh, then Simix, uh, kicks it up.  And then, he got the, you know, you see what?  And he kicks on the top, man.  He, kick.  Oh, no, not the beat!  Not the beat!  Ah!  I love my eyes!  My eyes! 
[04:21:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  And then, and then Friedrich, kick what he's up.  And he's like.  That's all you hear.  And Friedrich, kick what he's up.  Fucking annoying is that?  People took a boom with him.  And then Friedrich, come back eat.  And goombo.  Cock-a.  Cock-a-ping.  Get the fuck out of here with that.  You were watching yesterday, though, Patrice.  You were watching.  Dude, I try to enjoy every sport until I go, this officially sucks dick.  Right, right, right.  I'm going to tell you what's a more fun sport to watch. 
[04:22:00]  Women's softball with their underhanded fast throws.  Yeah, you like that fucking wot where they whip their arms around?  Those little fucking stubby little rock'em sock'em robots.  It's more fun to watch.  I watch college paintball championship the other day.  Is that better than the World Cup?  Motherfucker.  This is Mike Tirico here with two foreigners that you don't give a fuck about.  What do you think about this?  Well, Mike, they're really doing a thing there, Mike.  And they're really, we're here to, this is, like, we got Mike Tirico and Bob Lee, who are high-level dudes. 
[04:22:30]  Those are the go-to guys.  For ESPN, Bob Lee, Mike Tirico, and it used to be Dan Patrick were the go-to everywhere guys.  You know what I mean?  These fucking guys are now talking to the world's best guys.  This guy named Dullet, something Dullet. 
[04:23:00]  He's like, so what do you think about this?  Who do you think is going to win there?  This is Bob Lee.  Who do you think is going to win there, Dullet?  Oh, Mike, I see it as a 1-1 tie, Mike.  And, you know, this is the back line of, yeah, it's a, what the fuck?  This is the world's chance to shine, nigga.  I was saying the other day, after a World Cup game, the post-game show is the easiest thing for anyone to do.  What are you talking about after the game, especially when it's a 1-1 tie? 
[04:23:30]  You can wrap up the game in two minutes.  Yeah, let's go to the highlights.  You can win the World Cup and not win a game.  Like, it just can be a bunch of ties.  Yeah.  And the point system.  And the goals.  If it's 0-0, you get nothing.  Well, it's just, look, people who enjoy soccer, don't get mad.  A lot of people enjoying it.  Just say, okay, you don't like it.  Listen, this is how America, this is why we're losing.  We're losing our arrogance.  Yeah.  Look it.  Four billion people are watching this fucking World Cup, and America doesn't give a shit. 
[04:24:00]  And people want America to like it so fucking bad.  They really do want us to watch it and like it.  Don't you understand we don't watch it?  But there's four billion of you watching it on one TV, I might ask.  Just one TV.  Not even a flat screen, an actual real TV with antennas.  I was in fucking Brazil last World Cup, and fucking the hookers stopped working over there. 
[04:24:30]  Yeah.  It's fucking completely empty in World Cup time, boy.  They love it, but we just don't like it.  But stop being angry.  If you don't like football or basketball, I don't get mad.  I like it.  They really get pissed.  They get mad.  They really get pissed.  It's just not enjoyable for us.  It's something they do is not right.  Make a goal ten points.  I like that idea.  You're right about football.  Because technically, it's only scoring three, four times. 
[04:25:00]  Basketball should be one.  Yesterday's score in the NBA should have been 45 to 20.  But we want something about more.  Bigger numbers, more higher score.  Make a goal three.  Let me tell you something.  Which, when you're saying that an attempt at goal, it's only been ten attempts a game.  Eight to ten.  Make an attempt.  If you get to get a clean shot off in a certain area, make that count as a half a fucking point. 
[04:25:30]  Not the worst idea.  A goal is a full two points.  An attempt.  An official attempt in a certain area.  Goalie has to make the save.  It's a fucking...  Dude.  The only thing we care about, right?  In a hockey game.  And for people who don't like hockey.  I mean, people who don't like hockey and not like soccer.  We do love the mano a mano.  Alright, goalie's gonna stop you from trying to score a thing.  Oh, that's good.  Here it is. 
[04:26:00]  I love the...  And the soccer kicks?  I've never seen the goalie stop that.  It's basically, I'm going to pretend I'm kicking right, and the ball will go left.  The goal's just too fucking big for him to defend the entire thing.  So yeah, when it's just a player against a goalie, it's going in.  What?  It's going in.  You see that fucking English fool?  It just hit off his face. 
[04:26:30]  English fool.  His family probably has things painted on the door.  His fucking sister's going to get raped now because of that horse shit.  Bill Buckner, people go, oh, Bill, you suck.  But his life, he gets to live.  In Brazil, if they lose, one of those guys is going to get stabbed in the stomach.  Yeah, they'll kill him.  Well, that makes it kind of a cool sport.  If...  Think about it.  Yes, if you lose, your fucking awful fans stab you.  Imagine they do that in the Major League Baseball? 
[04:27:00]  Well...  You know?  Come on, man.  I watched England, USA, and I tweeted, I just watched this whole game.  I don't know if I watched a good game.  And I was being honest.  I had no idea.  And people were trying to explain it to me on Twitter.  Please, what is it?  This is why, and even their reasoning was like...  One day I want you to explain to me the...  Like, one day I want you to explain, because I have a friend who loves baseball.  And I just say, look, I'm a sports person.  Please explain to me one day, and a soccer guy explain to me one day, and a baseball... 
[04:27:30]  Just, what is the fucking thing about soccer?  Please tell me what the allure is as a fan.  I got an open mind where I'm...  I've been asking that question, and I still...  I don't want to hate soccer.  I don't get it.  I just do.  I don't have anything against it.  It just looks exhausting.  Just these poor...  How many miles do they run in one game?  I know basketball, they're running up and down, up and down, up and down.  But they stop.  They do stop.  It's called time out.  Soccer, they're just constantly just running and running and running. 
[04:28:00]  You ever see the time...  Sometimes they run as fast as they can to just stop the ball and do nothing with it.  And juggle it with their fucking shoulders.  You look tired just talking about it.  Let them...  You know what?  Ready?  Soccer?  Let them use their hands.  Fuck it.  Just fuck it.  You should be able to punch at the ball or something.  Everybody can fucking use their hands.  Just grab the ball and run with it.  Just pick it up.  Let me football, yeah.  And just...  Oh, it's too bad, Finch. 
[04:28:30]  Finch not liking the Patrice.  That's really too bad.  He hates me.  Yeah.  And Patrice is killing today.  What's wrong with you?  Fucking Finch.  Yeah, Finch.  You're the problem.  Not Patrice.  Finch.  Yeah, yeah.  You're the problem.  Finch.  Show me.  Patrice has given us some massive laughs so far today.  All right, so that's what he got on the World Cup.  More Opie and Anthony in a minute.  Actually, maybe more than one.  Hey, you guys.  It's Gabriel Iglesias, and I'm taking over Raw Bogg Sirius XM Comedy Hits for Fourth of

Sandy Kane is here.  B.S.  Before Sam.  That's right.  As if there was a time.  Well, there was.  I know.  I know.  I can't imagine the show without you.  Oh, you used to listen?  I used to listen to the O.P. and Anthony Show when I was in high school. 
[04:33:00]  Wow.  That's right.  How the fuck did you do it, Sam?  I mean, I think everyone's listening.  Yeah.  You know, you're such an inspiration to me.  Oh, thank you.  You know, and I know.  Well, you're an inspiration to me.  Look, I mean, there's no doubt about it.  You're the inspiration here.  You go out.  You put on a ridiculous wig.  You take your titties out.  You're a woman of a certain age.  Everybody's calling up.  They're making fun of you.  But you still go out there.  And you go out there into Times Square.  And you take your guitar.  And you take $2 pictures with people.  Yes. 
[04:33:30]  And you do it every day.  You make it work.  Yes.  A lot of people would not persevere, would they?  Well.  A lot of people wouldn't.  No.  I mean, I can't see why people, they feel that a certain age, they can't keep going.  Right.  Where the fuck?  You say, where the fuck is that person, man?  What was that?  She was a hot fucking comic.  She can work, man.  I wish I could work like her.  Where the fuck is she?  By the way.  Where did they go?  I did also want to say, Opie meant to say before he left.  Xbox One, the best games, the most advanced multiplayer.

[04:34:30]  You don't.  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  But you got any?  Okay.  That's what I thought.  Okay.  Lady Trucker.  Good morning, Samuel.  Good morning.  Hey, Sandy.  Now, you've been doing a lot of God talk today.  Is that because you're staying at the Salvation Army?  Okay.  That's a little ridiculous, isn't it?  No.  Well, first of all, I live in a great building.  I live in the Entertainer's Building, you know, in Manhattan, Hell's Kitchen.  So, I mean, Salvation Army was years ago, bitch. 
[04:35:00]  Right.  Bitch.  Hello?  She was a coward.  Oh, man.  Roy in New York.  Hey, what's up, Sammy?  How you doing?  Sandy Kane is here.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Why do you say that?  You know, why do you say that?  I don't know.  Well, then, you shouldn't have said it.  Sean in North Carolina.  You know?  Hey.  Sean.  Hey, Prom Tom.  What's up, buddy? 
[04:35:30]  Sandy Kane is here.  Hey, Sandy Kane.  How you doing?  All right, baby.  They call me the Naked Cowgirl.  In fact, my record's out as the Naked Cowgirl.  They asked me, do you want Sandy Kane or the Naked Cowgirl?  And the Naked Cowgirl's been very lucky for me as far as my name.  It's been, the minute I became the Naked Cowgirl, my life changed for the best.  I mean, the luckiest part about you naming yourself the Naked Cowgirl is all the fame that the Naked Cowboy had done. 
[04:36:00]  Exactly.  All the work he had done turned into luck for you.  Right.  But, Sammy, I was there one season, and they closed, they made a mall out of it, and all these buskers have come out because of Sandy Kane.  Right.  He was there for ten years, never a change.  Sandy Kane, the Naked Cowgirl came out, and I changed Times Square.  Right.  The most influence that the Naked Cowboy had was that time that you started copying him.  And then after that, it was all you. 
[04:36:30]  Well, it's not me.  You know, this man comes out day and night lately.  I mean, this man, I can't believe he works like you, Sam.  Yeah.  This man is...  Except I do it with pants on.  Yeah, well, and he never changes his pants.  No, no.  I mean, change your fucking pants, bitch.  So what else is going on, Sean?  Sam, you do more with less than anybody else I know of.  All right, Sean, you brown noser. 
[04:37:00]  Where's he from?  He's from North Carolina.  Sean.  Yes.  Stay on hold.  I'll send you the Xbox.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Take Sean's information.  We're going to send him Xbox One.  How great is that?  Oh, fuck.  How fucking great is that?  Oh, man.  You believe you just saw that, Sandy?  Baby, you're so powerful.  Isn't it amazing?  That's why I wrote...  Are you turned on right now?  Yeah.  You are, right?  You're such a baby, but you're such a fucking man.  Right.  Hallelujah.  It's like all your...  You could live out the pedophile dream without it being illegal. 
[04:37:30]  It's an incredible thing.  What makes you run?  It's like, what makes Sammy run?  Right.  You must have good parents.  I guess so.  I guess that's the secret.  What about you, Sandy?  What gives you the inspiration to get out into Times Square and to...  I love being the Naked Cowgirl.  And to stick those stickers over your nipples.  Yeah.  And to write these songs that make the world sing.  For instance, I got arrested by the N.Y.  Fucking P.D.  Fucking P.D. 
[04:38:00]  Oh, we.  Oh, we.  Oh, we.  Took away my fucking mobility.  Right.  Took my guitar.  Threw me in a police car.  So, you know, sometimes the...  Your biggest tragedies, you got to turn...  When you get lemons, make lemonade.  Right.  Yes.  So...  Does that mean getting pissed on?  Because we were talking to Denny Falcone earlier, who's the old school DJ, and Opie and Anthony were saying that he is into that type of thing. 
[04:38:30]  Getting peed on?  That's what they said.  Wow.  Weird.  Weird or not weird?  Have you ever done that?  Yes.  You've pissed on somebody or been pissed on?  Well, I was...  I used to work in the peep shows.  Pee shows or peep shows?  Peep.  Okay.  And there was a few guys that wanted my urine.  They did?  Yes.  Did you give it to them?  Yes.  You did?  Okay.  Of course.  How does that work?  In the peep show, aren't they separated from you?  They are, but you open the door and you give it to them.  And do you just piss through the door or do you just walk right in and piss on their face? 
[04:39:00]  No, they give you like a cup and they said, you know, for a tip, were you peeing this for me?  So I say, how much of a tip?  Right.  You know, and so if the tip was right, even $5 was good, man.  Right.  Yeah, okay.  And, you know, me, I was always drinking Diet Pepsi, so fine.  Just give me the fucking cup and just put the tip in there.  A nice Diet Pepsi piss.  Yes.  Yeah.  Now, how much did you make for a piss? 
[04:39:30]  How much did your urine go for?  To be honest, the one I remember was only $5.  Five bucks for a cup of your piss?  Yeah.  I mean, I guess you were going to do it anyway, so that's five bucks you wouldn't have had.  But you'd think for a nice cup of hot piss, for somebody who really wanted it, what did  they do with it?  Well, to be honest, I don't know, but there was a...  They take it home?  A club in Flatbush years ago.  Right.  I worked as a stripper.  You did.  I met this guy.  He was 90 years old.  Anyway, the waitress said, listen, this guy, he loves to drink piss. 
[04:40:00]  He did?  Yes.  Even at 90?  Yes.  Isn't that...  Speaking of inspirations...  Yeah, yeah.  I mean...  He's still...  So talk about not letting go.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  I think this is what kept him young.  Piss.  Yes.  Okay.  I swear.  No.  You know, and she said, Marie, the fucking waitress, said, listen, if you piss, he'll give  you 20 bucks.  Hey, that's...  Your piss just went up four times.  Right.  Right.  So anyway, we sat together, me and this 90-year-old guy.  He was not a bad guy. 
[04:40:30]  Right.  And so he would drink my piss.  I think the first one was 40.  And then I...  Out of a cup?  Yeah.  Okay.  He would go in the bathroom and drink it.  Yeah.  Did you...  Have you ever tasted your own piss?  No.  Okay.  Not yet.  No.  No.  But life is short.  I mean, life is long.  You have plenty of time.  I sat with him every break.  Right.  And I would pee every break.  He would buy me drinks and every break...  He would drink the piss.  And every break, the money that he gave me went down. 
[04:41:00]  Mm-hmm.  So...  Did you smell his breath after a couple of glasses of piss?  No, man.  Because I would assume it smelled like piss.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it smelled like pussy, but...  No.  Right.  You know, I don't remember smelling it, but...  But you've never had a boyfriend who was into water sports.  These were all clients.  Yeah.  I don't...  You know, most men aren't really into sex.  They're into, like, just having an orgasm, and that's it. 
[04:41:30]  Well, isn't that...  What do you mean, not into sex?  That's how you achieve orgasm, is through sex, no?  Yeah, their own orgasm.  Right.  You know, and it's not like they really get into the woman's pussy and make her have an  orgasm.  Right.  You know, you do 69, and you really get it out, get it on.  Very few men know how to please a woman.  They know how to please themselves.  How many orgasms would you say you've had in your life?  With different men? 
[04:42:00]  Yes.  Not many.  Not too many.  And how many have you been responsible for?  Meaning, how many have you given out?  Many.  Are we talking dozens, hundreds, thousands?  You know, like...  It's funny.  The Opie and Anthony and the Sam show...  Right.  You bring out the men in me, and you go, wow, I had a lot of fucking men.  Right.  But, uh...  So what are we thinking?  A lot of men.  Hundreds?  Thousands?  Could be thousands.  Not thousands of men.  Hundreds, though.  Gee, I just really never counted. 
[04:42:30]  You know, hundreds of a lot of men.  Yeah, well...  A lot of orgasms.  Yeah, it sounds like I keep...  More and more, like, wow, yeah, I did Jimmy Calvin in L.A., man.  He's an Indian.  Oh, I never tell you about the guys.  Two men in Nashville, Tennessee, y'all.  When was that?  Well, the first time I went to Nashville, I met Steve Smithson.  He looked like Johnny Cash, and he looked like Elvis Presley and sung like Johnny Cash. 
[04:43:00]  Gotcha.  Great guy, you know.  But terrible lover.  Not great in the sack.  He just wanted to have a New York baby.  Sandy, I want to have a New York baby with you.  So, he would just fuck me and see if I would get pregnant.  So, you...  Wait, wait, wait.  So, you would...  You would...  You were...  You're a part of that.  So, you would allow...  You would not have a condom on.  You would not use birth control.  No.  You would say, okay, sir, if you want to just see if you could make a New York baby, let's experiment.  I loved him, man.  You know, I loved him, man.  You did. 
[04:43:30]  Yeah, I loved him.  Right.  He was great.  A New York baby.  But he never was able to make that New York baby.  No.  That's a shame.  He lost his family in Nashville.  He had two kids and his wife took him.  So, he wanted to have a New York baby this time.  And I couldn't give that to him.  I had to come back to New York.  There's no work in Nashville.  I mean, I was working in the strip clubs.  That's what they say about Nashville.  Not a lot for a musician to do in Nashville.  No.  Right.  Well, I mean, not to get paid, anyway. 
[04:44:00]  Right, right.  I mean, a lot of, like, tootsies, and there's a lot of places to sign, baby, but to really...  But he dropped a few loads in you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because you want to have the New York baby.  Right, right.  So, it just...  Never happened, though.  Never happened.  Jay in Pittsburgh.  Hey, Sam.  How you doing?  Good, buddy.  Sandy Kane.  Hey.  Congrats on being clean.  I had some family go and visit New York City not too long ago, and I told them about  you, and they looked you up in Times Square, and they got a picture of you. 
[04:44:30]  My aunt and uncle actually have a picture of Sandy Kane on the mantle in their living room.  Family pictures, and there's a picture with my aunt and uncle and Sandy Kane.  Oh, wow.  And you're from Pittsburgh.  I live in Pittsburgh.  My family's from Buffalo.  So, all over these United States, you're making an impact, Sandy Kane.  Wow.  I'm a fucking mantle.  The question is, does Sandy Kane have any type of top on in the photo? 
[04:45:00]  A small amount of clothing.  Small.  Very small.  Very small.  Am I topless?  No.  No.  Ah.  That must have been a while ago.  Well, thanks, Jay.  It was a while ago.  It was a nice thing.  Thanks, Jay.  See.  Justin in Philly.  Hey, Sam.  What's up?  How you doing?  Yeah, actually, that guy just stole my thunder.  I was about to say the same exact thing.  I was in New York about a month ago, and I got a very flattering picture with Sandy Kane.  What made it flattering? 
[04:45:30]  Well, I guess it was unflattering, I guess.  I don't know.  She was urging me to get the titties in the shot.  So even to a complete stranger like Justin, you'll say, hey, make sure you get the titty.  Well, you know, you're paying a few dollars.  You want the fucking titties.  And not only for sex, baby, but it's something unique.  And if a man could do it, why can't a fucking woman?  Well, do men take their titties out?  I don't understand that.  No, men, men, let's say, you know, say the naked cowboy.  A man could just take his top off and walk through Times Square.  Right.  But if a woman takes her tits out, it's like, wow, you know, how could you do that shameful? 
[04:46:00]  A kid will see.  Well, so you must have been a big proponent of the nipple showing when people were protesting against Instagram's no nipple policy.  I don't think I remember that.  Okay.  All right.  That's fine, too.  Pat in Atlanta.  Hey, Sam, I just wanted to tell Sandy that I don't think I've laughed so hard in my life as when she told the David Brenner story. 
[04:46:30]  And it actually knocked you off of my number one hero list.  And now it's David Brenner.  How do you like that?  At one point, I was this guy's hero.  You know what, Sam?  You still are.  You still are.  But let's give it to David Brenner on this one.  And I think Sal actually has the clip, line of the day, believe it or not, Sandy Kane.  Oh, yes.  You want to listen to it?  Spitting his cum.  Okay, yes.  Okay, let's listen to it.  Here comes line of the day. 
[04:47:00]  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  True story.  I was spitting David Brenner's cum out in the sink.  And I heard the door slam.  What a great way to start a story.  He didn't even say goodbye.  You know, it's very, very risky, you know, as a performer and an entertainer, to start  a story with that kind of a laugh. 
[04:47:30]  But you did it, and you pulled it off, didn't you?  I pulled it fucking off, man.  And you pulled it off.  David Brenner pulled it out.  But he pulled it out, man.  And I sucked his dick.  You did, didn't you?  I fucking sucked his fucking dick.  It was so small, I couldn't even take two licks, okay?  Not even two.  It was, you know...  Well, George in Denver actually has a question that I think is on a lot of people's minds.  George, you're on the line with Sandy Kane, the naked cowgirl.  How you doing?  On the ONA show, you said that you don't enjoy intercourse as much as oral, maybe because 
[04:48:00]  you've been sleeping with guys with big dicks.  I'm just thinking, like, I'm sure Bobo would be more than happy to do anything you want,  and he has, like, three inches.  I mean, what happens about taking Bobo's penis?  I saw it.  Thank you, George.  You've seen Bobo's penis, correct?  Yes.  What do you think of the idea of taking his virginity?  Somebody needs to do it.  Ooh.  Um.  Uh.  You really think I would do that?  I'm asking you.  Say, man.  Fuck, I gotta hit record.  Fuck, I'm gonna fucking... 
[04:48:30]  We could get you some lubricant.  Okay.  Want to put Lady Di with him, maybe.  Yeah, you know, I mean, believe it or not, we think that you are cleaner than Lady Di.  We can't trust Lady Di.  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, well, clean.  So, I mean, is Bobo clean?  Well, he's a virgin.  Oh, wow.  Oh, in other words, he's clean.  Yeah, well, I'll tell you...  You're just not attracted to him.  To be honest, Sam, I saw his dick.  It really was nauseating.  It was, yeah.  I'm not that, you know, that squeamish, but I just really...  So, you're saying it takes a lot to really make you nauseous. 
[04:49:00]  Yeah, a short guy usually has a bigger dick, but he's a short guy with a small cock.  He looked like a, you know, like an infant.  A big, hairy, fat infant.  Yeah.  Is that what you're saying?  A small, hairy, fat, you know, it's just, you know, I mean, he's a little retarded.  And, you know, he's not my type, and I'm not on cocaine anymore, so maybe the right drug.  Okay, so, but it's not going to happen right now. 
[04:49:30]  Not right now, but...  When was the last time you had sex with somebody?  Tell me the truth.  The truth is, I am carrying on a spiritual sexual relationship.  It's spiritual.  How about a dick inside you, though, is what I'm...  I'm referring to a physical cock.  Not a middle finger.  No, no, no.  A full penis, balls deep.  A very long time.  Really?  Yeah, it's almost since Nashville, Tennessee, and Steve Smithson, and... 
[04:50:00]  So how many...  How long are we talking?  Long time.  Long time.  Um, long time.  A year?  Ten years?  Oh, long time.  Longer than ten years?  Hasn't been, you know?  Man, oh, man.  Sam, it's kind of weird.  Do you like it better that way?  Well...  Or are you looking for something?  Yeah, it's like looking for dick and all the wrong places.  Right.  Now, sometimes you just wonder that, you know, how come...  Because I am somewhat of a sexual...  And not that I'm not so hot.  Right.  But sometimes you...  No, you look... 
[04:50:30]  Look in times...  All the men, man, you know, go like, why not me?  There's a billion men.  Why not one for me?  Right.  That you meet someone and you have that...  You know, why is it over...  Why is it over at 32 for a woman?  Why over at 32?  You found it...  So 32?  Dude, that was a long time ago for you.  Yes.  After 32, you know, before 32, I had all these men.  Most of the men I'm talking about before 32.  Interesting.  But after 32, it, you know, was not too happening, except when I flew to Nashville and got laid 
[04:51:00]  by two guys.  When was that?  When I was 36.  Interesting.  In what decade?  A long time ago.  Man, oh, man.  Sal, would you?  Yeah.  You would?  You'd have sex with Sandy Kane?  Yeah.  I'm more interested in getting Bobo in that, though.  You wouldn't do it.  I mean...  I think you should, like, get a...  At least it's a sexual experience.  So you want me to...  You want to watch while me and Bobo...  No, no, no.  I'm saying I think we should, like, get a little bit of fun... 
[04:51:30]  Like, a fun going.  Would you...  Would you have sex with Bobo if...  And only if...  Sal sat in the room and jerked off?  I don't want to be there, dude.  But if it was something we needed to do for the show, I'm sure you would.  Sandy, what if that was the...  You know, you might think I'm, like, a really perverted type of person.  Yeah.  But I'm really a very straight...  I'm still Hamish, a Jewish bitch from Jersey.  So I'm really very straight.  I want to fall in love.  Like, even David Brenner, I was madly in love with him when I sucked his dick. 
[04:52:00]  Right.  But when he did that, I just, you know, I was...  I loved him.  So the only time, you know, I like...  But you would take it in the back door?  No.  I have a hemorrhoid, Sam.  Right, right.  Okay, so that's the problem.  So that's why my ass is pretty tight, you know?  Right.  What's the hemorrhoids?  They take up a lot of space.  It's like a...  I did a TV show.  Yeah.  And I showed my hemorrhoid.  It was really the first time I saw my own hemorrhoid.  What did it look like?  It's just like a round little thing.  And I said, close up on my hemorrhoid, so the camera, like, zoomed in. 
[04:52:30]  Right.  And there I was with my hemorrhoid.  And I said to myself, I didn't do this shit.  And I go, oh, no.  My mother's face got to like, oh, no.  Did you get nauseous when you saw your own hemorrhoid?  I just said, how the fuck can you do this, Sam?  To myself, I'm watching it, right?  With my popcorn.  Spreading your cheeks.  Yeah, and I said, yeah, I spread my cheeks.  And there I was.  And they zoomed in, the camera person.  Right.  It's also comedy, you know?  I'm a comedian.  Of course, it's funny shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Literally. 
[04:53:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, I do things for comedy a lot of times that even like, when they had the cherry  in the ass.  Yeah.  Were you here then?  Yeah, you were there.  But here's what's interesting about the whole thing is, you can look at your own hemorrhoid  and eat popcorn, but you look at Bobo's dick and you become nauseous.  So, I mean, that really does say a lot about what Bobo's got going on downstairs.  I do want to tell you, Sandy King, there's something that you should know about, you know,  the summer is your season.  And this summer, I want you to check out USA Network's new original drama series, Rush. 
[04:53:30]  It's about a good doctor.  You've heard about this, right, Roland?  It's always.  It's good?  It's good.  I love it.  We can't wait.  Well, it's about a good doctor with a few bad habits.  I think you know about that, Sandy.  Tom Ellis stars as renegade physician Dr. William P. Rush.  Rush examines the world of Dr. William P. Rush, a medical fixer who's always on call.  He's the best doctor in town, but his personal life could use some help.  He privately caters to the rich and powerful of Los Angeles, which includes celebrities 
[04:54:00]  in trouble, athletes with issues, and politicians with problems.  You name it, he'll name the price.  Though the hard-partying doctor claims that he does not make judgments about his less-than-squeaky-clean clients,  he is not immune to the ugliness he encounters.  His services and discretion are legendary.  While the best-off-the-books medical care doesn't come cheap, he's definitely worth it.  He provides medical attention without all the attention. 
[04:54:30]  Follow the show on Twitter, at Rush on USA.  Rush, a new original series, premieres Thursday, July 17th at 9 p.m. Eastern, 8 p.m. Central,  only on USA Network.  Good doctor, bad habits.  Great.  Yeah.  Looks like a good show.  Doctors, I mean, that's why I go to...  You ever fuck a doctor?  Um, did I ever fuck a doctor?  That's what I'm wondering.  I must have.  Yeah, I would assume so.  Yeah, I mean, I must have... 
[04:55:00]  A lot of dick for there not to be a doctor in there somewhere.  Yeah, yeah, a lot of dick.  Let me think about that one.  All right, well, you spent some time thinking about it.  I think we're going to take a few days off.  Celebrate Independence Day.  Ah.  July 4th is a Friday.  Right, it's supposed to rain.  Sam Roberts, well, depending on where you are, Sam Roberts Friday show will be on.  It'll be a special.  A whole bunch of interviews that you've never heard before.  T.I. is going to be on my show.  Clark Gregg.  Linda Perry from Four Non Blonde.  She's like a songwriter now.  Very interesting, interesting lady. 
[04:55:30]  Linda Perry was married to Richard Perry, who wrote Jump and wrote a lot of great songs.  Very interestingly.  Tiny Tim, Linda Perry.  So all these people will be on Sam Roberts Friday show.  She was married to...  Her father was George Goldner, a very big record man.
