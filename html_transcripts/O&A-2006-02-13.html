<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a crude, rambling introduction involving a beekeeper and an offensive joke. The hosts then debated the severity of a recent New York City blizzard, with Anthony recounting a frustrating experience with AOL customer service that unexpectedly led him to an adult entertainment phone number.  Jimmy Norton's bad day, exacerbated by AOL issues and a Rite Aid pharmacist encounter, was also discussed.  The conversation transitioned to a discussion of a Tyra Banks show segment on phobias and a caller from Colorado disputing Anthony’s downplaying of the blizzard.  The show then revisited the previous day's broadcast, highlighting a lengthy and unpredictable segment with a guest called “Schizo Bill,” which prompted a discussion about the hosts’ and Bill Burr's post-show guilt and coping mechanisms for dealing with potentially offensive material.  A video of intoxicated producer E-Rock in Times Square during the blizzard was shown, followed by listener reactions to the “Schizo Bill” segment and updates on his well-being.  The hosts also promoted an upcoming “American Mess” contest and discussed Michelle Kwan's Olympic withdrawal, criticizing the Olympic broadcast schedule.  A listener clarified the availability of live Olympic hockey coverage before the segment concluded with a discussion of bizarre, discontinued Olympic events.

The show continued with an extensive discussion of unusual past Olympic events, including tug-of-war, motorboating, club swinging, and live pigeon shooting.  The Dick Cheney hunting accident was a major topic, sparking numerous off-color jokes from the hosts and callers.  Listener calls contributed more inappropriate humor, including a story about a luge competitor nicknamed “the white sausage” and commentary on the *Pink Panther* movie.  A movie review segment with guest Kent added to the comedic banter.  The death of Peter Benchley was briefly mentioned.  The upcoming move to a new studio and some staff members were discussed.  The segment was heavily laden with profanity, sexually suggestive remarks, and crude humor.

A significant portion focused on listener calls generating puns based on the Dick Cheney shooting accident, repeatedly using variations of "Dick" and "load" in increasingly absurd scenarios.  A voicemail from Jim Norton's ex-girlfriend, Erin, was played.  Erin called to inquire about potential STIs after unprotected sex with a female prostitute, detailing her experience hiring three prostitutes, rejecting two, and having a threesome with one, while expressing her concerns and unusual symptoms.  The hosts and Erin engaged in a phone conversation about this experience, punctuated by jokes and comments.

The show then shifted to a lengthy discussion of Scott Ferrall's move to Sirius XM, expressing anger and frustration over what they perceived as his disloyalty and attempts to ingratiate himself with Howard Stern.  Audio clips of Ferrall praising Stern were played.  Numerous listener calls echoed the hosts' sentiments, adding insults and commentary.  The discussion broadened to include other radio personalities and perceived betrayals, including Dice.  The hosts extensively vented about disloyalty within the radio industry.  The segment also featured physical comedy involving a staff member, Eric, whose tuna sandwich was destroyed, and humor stemming from the cold studio temperature due to the air conditioning being left on. The show concluded with more listener calls, a discussion about upcoming events, and an open call for new “freaks” for the show and plans for a “PalTalk war room” to confront Ferrall.

[00:05:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  guys here again. What have we got here, fucking comedian? The bee guy gave me water. I swear  to God, there's a bee guy. There's a beekeeper coming in to talk to me, and he gave me water,  I think. What's your name, beekeeper? There's a beekeeper here. Bullshit, it looks to me 
[00:06:00]  like the best part of you ran down to cracking your mama's ass and ended up with a brown  stain on the mattress. There's a beekeeper tearing things apart. Is the beekeeper still  there? Yes. Fuck the beekeeper. Do your goddamn act, all right? Yes. I like my jokes like  sex, short in and out with lots of laughter, and I always kill. Did you like that joke, 
[00:06:30]  beekeeper? Now lean forward and joke yourself. Oh, wow, what a day on Friday, huh? Oh, yeah.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio. Hi there. Good  morning. It's an okay morning. Why? Blizzard 06. What happened? There was some snow or something? 
[00:07:00]  Most snow ever in New York City. Most snow ever. They were so happy with that, that that happened.  So happy with themselves, all the news people, that they could say most snow ever in the history  since the earth formed, I guess. This is the most snow that's ever fallen. I'm not believing  it. I want to see the records from 1208. Where are they? I want to see the records of the winter 
[00:07:30]  of 1208. Did they keep that on some parchment somewhere? Right. And the snow felleth. We  humans are stupid. We're pompous assholes. We're just very pompous, very self-important. We've  been keeping records for, what, a little over 100 years, so we're saying most snow ever. Really?  Dropping the bucket as far as time goes. God is sitting somewhere laughing at us going,  these dopes think it's the most snow ever. Do you know what 22 BC was like, you idiots? Yeah, 
[00:08:00]  right. I piled snow on Manhattan. I read transcripts from like 300 years ago. We said,  I was walking down Fifth Avenue. The snow was so bad, I lost my slave.  Most snow ever. Shut up. We did get like 27 inches in Central Park, though.  No, Opie, it was 26.9. I rounded off. It was not 27. It was 27 inches somewhere.  You could just tell with the flake. One flake falls by the ruler, and it puts it up another 
[00:08:30]  sixteenth of an inch. Yeah, well, most snow ever. There you go.  They were very happy with themselves. I took a big beating on the message board, because  apparently people had said I predicted that this would be a nothing, and that I gave a  weather forecast that said it was going to be nothing. And that is not the truth. What  I said was the news people usually hype it up, and it turns out to be nothing. That was  not true. They hyped it up, and it was record-breaking. But the forecast I gave was for a Nor'easter. 
[00:09:00]  I was arguing with the guy from Colorado that said the storm was passing over him at the time,  and it was nothing. And I said, but when it gets here and mixes with the Gulf Stream and  gave that whole spiel, then it turns into something big. I'm not going to take abuse like that for  no reason. Yeah. Bastards, I'm still the professor. And little Jimmy Noren's a little  pissed off this morning. Jimmy! What's wrong, Jimmy? I'm just really cranky today, man. 
[00:09:30]  Why? You are so cranky. It started yesterday. I've just been cranky, and I didn't sleep well  last night, and I spent over an hour on the phone dealing with America Online, and I'm  just in a bad mood. They're difficult to deal with. What did AOL do to you? The AOL, first  of all, everybody tells me, don't use AOL. Stop using AOL, and I know you're right.  I know it, but I'm kind of stuck in there. Not one person has ever said, are you using  an AOL? Oh, that's great news. Good move. 
[00:10:00]  You mean AOL? The AOL that is in partnership with XM Satellite Radio?  Yeah. Have we heard of AOL?  I have no idea.  I don't think so.  I think they are.  Oh, cool.  But, you know, I went off on General Motors and got a door.  Here's my problem with AOL. Yellow Treats, my screen name, has not been showing up on anybody's  buddy list for a long time. Uh-oh. Nothing to do with my settings. I went through all  my IM settings, and I went through the phone last night, and the guy was helpful. This  would happen. I call one lady. She goes, well, the number you need to call, and she gives 
[00:10:30]  me the number. So I said, okay. But then she patches me through.  Excuse me.  Okay.  Central Park, 27 inches. It says it right on ABC.  They rounded it off.  ABC doesn't have decimal points in their things. It's common knowledge.  But they rounded it up like I did. All right. Sorry, Jim.  That's all right. Sorry about that, Jimmy.  That's fine.  So she tells me, all right, call this number in the future, but then she patches me through.  The operator, the guy, is very helpful who I talk to.  Okay.  I give you a case number. He goes, I'm not sure what this is. It might be a server issue. 
[00:11:00]  We'll check it. We get disconnected. You know, you ever been talking, all of a sudden  you hear that, boom, like that little, that you know you've been hung up on, but it wasn't  intentional.  Yeah.  So I call the number that she gives me before I talk to him, and it's an AOL tech, and they  say, oh, you don't need to call this number. You need to call a customer service number,  and I'm annoyed now.  Oh, my God.  See, at that point, I start getting like, oh, boy, here we go.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  I was, and I said, by the way, Hawk, could you give this to Opekins, please? 
[00:11:30]  Thank you.  There's a number on there.  I say, look, they told me to dial this number, and she goes, well, this is not the number  you need to dial, and this is the number she gives me. Ben just checked it. You can dial  that on the air. Trust me. You can dial that on the air.  Oh, you want me to?  I think you should, yeah.  Oh, all right.  I don't think this is one of the rare outgoing phone call segments on the program.  Yeah.  We used to do this all the time.  This is the number I got for it.  This is the number? What? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, you checked it.  We've got to do it from the air.  You checked it. Okay.  Uh-oh, E-Rock's on it.  All right, good.  Wait, how do we, uh...  This'll, uh, this'll work.  Is this going to work?  Is it, uh, E-Rock?  I bring nothing to the table.  All right.  How close?  Dud, are you ready for some hard anal action?  I am.  Bend me over and plunge your hard, stiff rod into my tight hole and calm.  I want to feel you shoot your load deep inside me.  If you're an experienced caller, you can enter your credit card at any time. 
[00:12:30]  I kiss you on the mouth.  It's a Visa, MasterCard, American Express.  Do you want to kiss me here?  This service is sponsored by ACN.  If you're under...  No way.  That's the number I got.  No way.  From an AOL tech to dial.  I even checked, because that's an 800 number.  I said, maybe.  It's 866.  And I tried that.  Or whatever the other thing was.  Yeah, but she said, the dude who's here, she said 1-800.  That's 1-5-0-9.  Wow. 
[00:13:00]  Dude.  That's the number I got, so I called back.  From a guy or a girl?  It was some...  I think it might have been a girl who I was calling, sir.  I couldn't tell.  I was so cranky.  I couldn't really tell.  You must have really been cranky on the phone.  Because I was screaming, and the message kept going, hi, how may I help you?  Operator.  Hi, but I need to take your account.  Operator.  I was fucking screaming at it.  Operator.  Operator, please.  Operator.  That's all I would say.  I hate that.  And then they go, okay, let me get a technician for you. 
[00:13:30]  I think I understand.  No, you don't.  Quiet machine.  You don't understand.  No one understands.  So I called back, just screaming about this.  Oh, my God.  And I was more angry that I was inconvenienced, because I don't care that...  If they did it by accident, it stinks.  If they did it on purpose, it's hilarious.  It is really funny.  This cranky asshole yelling at the machine.  Give him the gay porn number.  So I got help, and I asked the guy where he was, and he said, in the Philippines. 
[00:14:00]  So I spent 40 minutes with them on the phone, trying to explain what happened.  And he kept going, okay, so the last technician, and I'm like, no, no, no.  The last technician was nice.  He was good.  He helped me.  They never fucking get it.  So it was just a nightmare.  Did you figure it out in the end?  It's probably a server problem.  I don't know what it is, but I went over every stupid I am setting option.  It's not one of my settings, and AOL is not blocking me.  I don't know what the problem is. 
[00:14:30]  I don't know.  Do you ever lose it so bad with customer service they have to remind you that they're taping the phone call?  No.  Oh, I've gotten to that point.  I'm like, I don't give a shit you're taping this.  Help me.  I get very, very like, oh, so let me get this straight now.  You're telling me that, like, that whole attitude, and they hate it, but they can't really unload on you when you do that.  I'm not yelling like you motherfuckers or anything like that, but I'm very, the word is condescending to them on the phone. 
[00:15:00]  And they get very annoyed with that, and they're like, sir, I'm trying to help you here, sir.  Hate them all.  And yeah, it's all India, the Philippines now.  You know who I want to strangle was a night guy.  He's a fucking pharmacist over at a Rite Aid.  He's a 24-hour night pharmacist.  Why did they pick up the phone?  Oh, no, no.  This was in person.  Oh, okay.  There, I went in for a prescription.  I had asked them to fill a prescription for Nexium, my stupid reflux. 
[00:15:30]  And what happened was there was a mix-up with the prescription.  There was, they thought, he thought it went out, but it hadn't gone out or something like that.  I'm like, sir, check the bill.  It shows I didn't pick it up, correct?  He goes, yes, but I don't know where it is.  And I'm saying, well, that's not my problem.  And he goes, well, I can't give away $300 worth of medication.  And I can feel myself getting to the point where I wanted to bite him.  Like, I didn't want to punch him.  I wanted to sink my teeth into the fucking bridge of his nose.  Sir, you better have some Xanax back there and throw some in my mouth immediately because 
[00:16:00]  I'm going to choke you.  I'm like, dude, who scams?  I'm like, this isn't a get-high drug.  Who comes here at one in the morning and scams for Nexium, you asshole?  Yeah, what's the going rate on the street per tab for Nexium?  He was such a fucking coward and so afraid of losing his gig.  And I was also getting Allegra D, so he was filling that one.  I'm mumbling the whole time.  I know you're just fucking afraid of losing your job.  Everybody's a fucking coward.  Like, I wanted him to say something. 
[00:16:30]  I was just physically going to throw something at him, so I wanted this.  You wanted a reason to bite him.  I really did, dude.  They wouldn't arrest you.  He was unshaven, and I started to hate his unshaven neck and shin.  Like, he was just a slovenly-  Hate every little square inch of a person.  I hated him.  I still hate him.  If he's listening, and I'm sure he's not, I hope you're dead.  Pharmacists are very nasty people.  Yeah, they're creeps.  Are they still going?  $0.99 per minute with a $3.99 connection fee.  Call now.  Remember, if you press the star key, you can hear these numbers again.  Don't keep these guys waiting.  If you feel you're experiencing system problems, please hang up and call our customer service 
[00:17:00]  department at 1-800.  All right.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  You know who should do this?  Our own Steve Sue.  All right, you went hot gay man on that action.  Put your smooth cock against my face.  Jesus.  Heather, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Tonight on Tyra, there's real Brokeback Mountains on.  Tyra has real gay cowboys on today? 
[00:17:30]  Real gay cowboys.  Yes, and the women to tell the stories about it.  Oh, we'll be rolling tape today.  Roll them.  We got the Tyra Banks show where she was scared of dolphins.  Oh, great.  Oh, she had a phobia of dolphins, and she did a whole show on how to get over your fears,  and she gets over her fears of dolphins.  It's not like being afraid of a puggle.  Over her fear of dolphins.  Huh?  It's like being afraid of a puggle.  Exactly.  Dolphins are just the most adorable little thing.  They get up on their tail, do that backwards thing on their tail. 
[00:18:00]  They bring you a ball, and if you're lucky, they have sex with you.  Right.  They try to fuck you.  You ever scratch their neck when they're caught in the net, and then just laugh and go have  a tuna sandwich?  And too bad Tyra doesn't have a fear of doing a shitty show that she could get over.  Too bad she's completely unafraid of that.  Stupid.  Yeah, she goes headlong every day.  It was a show on phobias.  She's scared of dolphins.  Another girl came in.  She was afraid of pennies.  Afraid of pennies?  Yeah, so we got some audio from that dumb show. 
[00:18:30]  We'll go over a little later.  Last name wasn't Goldberg, was it?  Eric in Colorado.  Of course not.  Eric.  Yeah, hey, Anthony, you got your nor'easter, but it must not be very bad that you guys were  able to be on the air today.  No, Anthony talked about this in the office.  This guy sounds a little meh.  Yeah.  I said it wasn't going to be shit.  This is the guy from Colorado, Anthony.  Dude, dude, it was record setting.  It was big.  It's just that we were talking about this in the office.  It wasn't that it wasn't bad.  It's that it's the 21st century, and they finally figured out how to get rid of snow 
[00:19:00]  and not let it...  If it was as bad as they were predicting, you would still be at home snuggled in.  No, I have a massive vehicle that went through two feet of snow in my driveway without even  slowing down, my friend.  It was actually worse than they predicted, sir.  Did you say anything about they're clearing the snow for you?  It was worse than they predicted.  Most snow ever!  Most snow ever, Eric!  And it was because...  You have no argument.  If this happened...  If this happened...  Hell, we've been getting that every couple weeks in the mountains. 
[00:19:30]  You also have thin air in that stupid Mile High shit city.  Rotten little parrot lungs.  Don't breathe.  Ass.  Jimmy's going to go to Aspen in three weeks, and they're going to have another blizzard.  They get 10 inches of snow every four days.  Oh, I know there's a lot of snow in Aspen, sir.  They ski there.  Eric, this is New York City.  We're not used to having snow in general.  You should be.  We get one snowstorm a year now.  Ah.  There ain't a snowstorm.  If you can get around... 
[00:20:00]  Oh, I would love to hear an avalanche cover this guy.  No kidding.  Eric, you picked the wrong day to make fun of us.  They're saying most snow ever.  Yeah.  Most snow ever!  They just figured out how to get rid of it.  I'm from the East Coast originally, so to me, unless the city's completely shut down,  it's not that bad.  It doesn't shut down anymore, you fucking idiot.  It's called machinery.  They figured it out.  They figured it out.  If it happened in 1976, this would have shut down New York City for days.  Yeah, or at least...  Yeah. 
[00:20:30]  They figured it out.  The economy is okay, so we get the snow removed.  The salt and the plows get out there while it's still snowing, so it doesn't pile up.  They have things called melters these days in Times Square.  They pick it up and bulldoze it, throw it in melters.  It goes down the sewers, water.  You don't even see snow in Times Square anymore.  You know what would have been good?  To get pictures of Times Square this morning, because you can't even tell it snowed.  The communication between the plow drivers and their mission control is so good that  they're not trying to plow the same streets. 
[00:21:00]  They're not missing streets.  They have a system in place.  They finally figured it out.  The news hasn't.  They still want you to go out and stock up on milk and canned goods and go out to the  barn and gather up your eggs like it's a little house on the fucking prairie.  Don't worry.  The day after a blizzard, the day after what they're calling the biggest blizzard in New  York City history...  Most snow ever!  ...everyone's getting into work.  Everyone can leave their house.  It's fine because we figured out how to get rid of snow. 
[00:21:30]  I love the dopes that go right to the supermarket when these blizzards are coming, though.  What the fuck?  I think it's hilarious.  I had to get some lunch.  I was like, maybe the stores are going to be closed today.  So I just went to buy some stuff.  Delivery was bad.  Couldn't get delivery.  Well, I didn't buy milk and bread.  I just bought like a sandwich and a couple of things in case it kept snowing.  It kept snowing and stores were closed.  I wanted to have dinner.  He didn't have anything in the house.  My refrigerator's empty, dude.  It's awful.  Do you have a little empty refrigerator?  It's got nothing in it.  It's got a mask from fucking Lush. 
[00:22:00]  A Lush mask, which I think is too old to use.  It's probably all spores and fungi.  I threw all my Lush soap away.  I love my Lush soap.  I hated my Lush soap.  What a waste of money, that Lush soap.  I enjoyed it.  I still lather up with it.  When we went on our little field trip in Washington.  You remember that soap?  We woke back soap fires.  Faggots.  You remember when we were kids, though, there was a big storm?  See, this guy doesn't understand.  It's the fact that when I came out, it was actually impressively well cleaned up. 
[00:22:30]  But I remember one year when I was a kid, it was bad snow, and we shut down for like nine months.  Was it nine months?  Do you remember that?  It couldn't go out until August 8th.  I, uh, boy, I don't remember that one, Jimmy.  No.  It's a bad one.  Hot man on man love.  Hello, is this, yellow treats is not being visible.  Would you like your cocksuck?  I would, but could you please?  Excuse me.  Can we stay focused here on my problem?  And by the way, the two fags in that stupid sex thing were more helpful than the AOL attack from Manila. 
[00:23:00]  Speaking of the snowstorm really fast, I'm watching the coverage on the news yesterday morning.  And they're showing people in Times Square at 1.30 in the morning when the snow really started kicking in.  Yeah.  And they're just showing, you know, Times Square and people walking around.  When was this?  About, uh, they said this is about Saturday night.  This would have been Friday late night.  Oh, wait, wait.  Okay.  No, yesterday was Sunday.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, Saturday, uh.  Saturday late night.  Right.  So, they're saying, you know, this is what Times Square looked like at 1.30 in the morning when the snow really started kicking in. 
[00:23:30]  And they're showing people walking around drunk and stuff.  Our own E-Rock was captured on the news walking around Times Square.  Great.  I gotta get it off my DVR.  E-Rock stumbling around Times Square.  No winter clothes on whatsoever.  Didn't you know the storm was coming?  Yeah, I had a coat on.  I just, I had a coat and gloves.  That was it.  They, they showed you and, uh, I guess a couple of your friends.  You guys looked like you were hammered. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, we were, uh.  They walked up to him, uh, with the mic and, uh, this was, is this on?  Is this on?  Is this on?  Thanks, man.  Aren't you the, uh, producer for the, uh, Opie and Anthony show?  I bring nothing to the table.  Oh, okay.  I love my DVR because they just rewinded, rewound that a bunch of times and just watched E-Rock.  It was definitely him.  Positive.  No doubt in my mind.  And I even emailed him immediately and he, he wrote back, hey, what time was that at?  What were you doing in Times Square?  Were you following John Voight into a movie theater?  The best part about that, when you wrote me back going, what time was that? 
[00:24:30]  There was a little paranoia.  Yeah.  In your, uh, your text message or email or whatever.  Like, what time was that?  I'm like, 1.30.  He's like, oh, yeah, yeah, that was me.  Willing to, willing to admit that you were in Times Square at 1.30, but not willing to admit you were there at 3.30.  A little blizzard drinking?  Yeah.  We were celebrating.  But the news caught him.  It was pretty funny.  All right.  Let's say hi to Chris in Florida.  Chris.  Hey, hey.  Morning, boys.  How much snow you got down there? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, didn't everybody in?  I'm up in Toga.  We didn't get hardly any snow at all.  You guys got hammered.  We got nothing.  That's what I love about doing a national talk show now.  Yeah.  We would be just talking about the blizzard all day.  Blizzard, blizzard.  But now we just got a guy in Florida.  How warm is it going to be today?  No, I'm in upstate New York.  Oh, it says Florida.  Okay.  The hell?  And we didn't get squats.  All right.  What do you got, Chris?  My dad's a clinical psychologist.  He deals in a mental health clinic.  He deals with Melio all the time.  I made him listen to the replay for Friday. 
[00:25:30]  He is now a subscriber to XM Radio.  Really?  He laughed his balls off.  He's getting his rhodiac seated at X.  Let me ask you a question.  What is the difference between a psychologist and a clinical psychologist?  Or is that just a title?  He works in a clinic, basically.  All the fuckers who can't afford mental health, they come in.  Okay.  Those are the ones that are in real bad shape, by the way.  Yeah, he deals with schizophrenics all the time, and he laughed his balls off.  It was hilarious.  That Schizo Bill bit was so freaking funny.  We really, really enjoyed fucking with that guy for an hour. 
[00:26:00]  That's the beauty of satellite radio.  You could go long form every once in a while, you know, and experiment and take a big chance.  We took a big chance.  We said, you know what?  The last hour of this show, fuck it.  We're just going to mess with this guy and see how far we can take it.  We didn't know where we were going to go with the bit.  We didn't know how it was going to end.  We just knew we had something there, and we just had to try it.  Who was in the beekeeper's outfit?  What beekeeper, sir?  Just as crazy as he was.  Yeah, we don't know anyone in a beekeeper suit. 
[00:26:30]  That's right.  All right, boys.  Punch it out.  All right.  I don't know this beekeeper.  I don't know what he does.  Here's the deal.  Schizo Bill will be available on audible.com later today.  Oh.  Just that bit.  Just that one-hour bit so you guys can spread the virus and send it to your pals that don't know about the O.P. and Anthony show.  I walked out with Bill Burr Friday.  Knowing Bill, he was not happy.  Had the down the sidewalk.  I've had these conversations with Bill too many times to count.  The walk down the sidewalk, riddled with guilt conversation that Bill has with me. 
[00:27:00]  Like he really feels bad, but he can't stop.  He's addressed the fact that he sits here, gets involved, but then there's a breaking point during the show, during the segment,  where he feels very bad, thinks it goes too far, and leaves going home feeling badly.  Tells his girlfriend about it.  His girlfriend tells him to shut up. 
[00:27:30]  If you don't like it, don't do the show anymore.  He's a man in crisis every time he leaves the show.  O.P. and I had the same discussion.  He said we were agreeing that we wish he would have hurt himself.  Somehow physically, more than mentally.  It makes sense when you're doing it and you're in studio.  Yeah.  And then there are days you leave and you walk down the sidewalk and you see normal people that you know are not fans of the show,  have no clue who you are.  Yeah.  And you just feel dirty.  You feel like you have to go home and scrub with Brillo. 
[00:28:00]  Over 10 years of doing the Opie and Anthony show, I have learned to rationalize things where I try to keep as guilt-free as possible while doing this show.  It's a fine line.  But Bill, like, I don't need Bill telling me these things as we're walking down the sidewalk.  Because then I start second-guessing myself and thinking and going, yeah, you know, maybe that was really mean. 
[00:28:30]  You know what I do?  What?  I convince myself that I'm an actor.  Right.  And then I'm playing a role.  Playing a role.  Hey, what did you Bill do?  Did you guys stop in and get a manicure together and have your fucking, your dresses pressed?  I love the fact that we fucked with that creep and we should continue to do it.  I understand.  Stop having a conscience.  I understand.  Nice escalade, nice home you're moving into.  Look, I am right.  Keep fucking with people.  I am right here with you, Jimmy.  I am right here with you.  I'm not saying that I'm agreeing with Bill and I'm ready to abandon the show. 
[00:29:00]  I'm saying, Bill, shut the fuck up.  You're bringing me down.  All right.  Enough of Bill and his good heart.  Bill's not a sweet boy.  Bill's a sociopath.  You understand swimming under his pleasant smile and his chiseled jaw is a fucking sociopath?  Do you understand that?  That stare that he had was creepy.  The look he gave.  Which Bill?  Oh, you're talking about Bill Burr.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Burr's a nut deep down.  There's a complete wacko.  I'm talking now about the stare that Schizo Bill had. 
[00:29:30]  That was very, very, very creepy.  Well, the videos are up on opiananthony.com from Friday's show.  Lots and lots of video of Schizo Bill with the beekeeper coming in and out and all that fun stuff.  My favorite part, by the way, and because it's radio, obviously it doesn't do it justice.  Unless they got it on video, I don't know.  I think the people on Pal Talk got to see it live.  Uh-huh.  Pal Talk blowing up.  We'll have to talk about that later.  Oh, yeah.  Now it's all about Pal Talk.  People don't even acknowledge they're part of Wack Bag. 
[00:30:00]  It's, no, I'm a Pal Talk guy.  Pal Talker.  It's kind of weird.  But anyway, Anthony's interviewing Bill, Schizo Bill there.  We already left the studio.  I started that whole thing.  I left first and then I was trying to get everyone out.  And Anthony was stuck in the studio and continued to interview him and made his seat go down slowly until he disappeared.  I've never left harder from the other room in my life.  Yeah, he was really freaking out. 
[00:30:30]  Because Anthony, just as normal as could be, still trying to interview him and just slowly but surely he disappears in front of Bill's eyes.  And then he's, where did you go?  Who's talking to me?  And now Anthony is carrying on a conversation under the console.  He has his microphone under the console.  Yeah.  And just continues the interview with him.  Poor fella.  And anybody that thought that guy was faking it or whatever, he sat in this studio all through the break in between the shows and into Ron and Fez's show.  He sat in this room alone. 
[00:31:00]  Right.  He's a fucking weird dude.  Talking to himself.  And what you didn't get to hear because we went off the air Friday and then Ron and Fez started up.  But Pal Talk got to see it.  That's the beauty of this damn Pal Talk to get a little extra show.  Because we keep the mics on during breaks.  You get to hear some stuff that maybe we shouldn't be telling you guys.  Yeah, and then when the show's over, you get to see the changeover between shows.  So the show ends, and you guys pretty much heard the ending of the show, and Schizo Bill was still sitting there.  Then we decided to make believe we never did the show. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  And Pal Talk, they all saw this, where we were coming and going, hey, hey, what's up, Bill?  We're going to interview you today.  I'm Opie, and this is Anthony, and this is Jim Norton.  And then we're taking breakfast orders and all this stuff and making believe we didn't even do a show yet.  And he goes, I just did the show with you guys.  And we have two clocks on the wall behind Jim Norton, and one's a West Coast clock.  So it looks like it's morning.  Yeah.  And we're like, no, see the clock on the left?  It's whatever time.  It would be 8 in the morning or whatever.  We're like, no, it's 8 in the morning.  We're starting in a little while.  Do you need anything, Bill? 
[00:32:00]  Do you need coffee?  He was so freaking confused.  Yeah, he didn't know what the hell was going on.  And we got him to sit through until Ron and Fez started, and then Ron and Fez did a half hour with him.  So it was unbelievable.  So I'm going to suggest that next time Schizo Bill comes in, we have half a Hulk face sitting in.  Oh, my God.  Wow, would that just freak him out and not acknowledge him?  Yeah.  Make like he's just seeing him.  By the way, I can't wait to see what shows up on Friday.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:32:30]  I think game on.  Game on.  I think we were starting to lose our American Mess contest.  Game on.  American Mess, we're looking for people like Schizo Bill or half a Hulk face or Scully Opie.  Looking for new freaks.  Scully Opie.  Best name ever.  Looking for new freaks for the Opie and Anthony show.  Whether you're a freak, you got something wrong with you physically, mentally, we don't care.  You got a special talent, like you can smoke cigarettes from your vag.  We don't care.  Seen that.  And you're a guy.  It's a talent show.  It's a freak show.  It's everything. 
[00:33:00]  It's American Mess.  And now I'm thinking because of Schizo Bill that the contest officially begins.  I think now we're going to get some people.  Game on.  Game on.  But the videos are up on opiananthony.com.  And the actual bit, just the one-hour bit of Schizo Bill will be available on audible.com a little later this morning, I guess.  Okay?  Right.  Let's say hi to Lucky Strike.  Lucky Strike, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hello.  Friday show, man.  Unbelievable. 
[00:33:30]  I wish I had power talk so I could have watched all that craziness going in there.  But did you hear when you guys were talking to him about his name?  It was Martin, I guess.  And he was like, there is no Martin, only Bill.  If you remember from, like, Ghostbusters, there is no Dana, only Zul.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I believe that was his inner one coming out.  Yeah.  It is.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Do you listen to old-time radio on the XM there? 
[00:34:00]  Like what, the 50s?  Yeah.  The 40s?  No, there's an actual channel called Old-Time Radio or something like that.  Oh, is it?  I have no idea how many different fucking channels are.  Where's the old radio serials?  Real?  Oh.  You got to check it out.  It's hilarious.  Wow, I got to check that out.  You do?  I can't remember the station or whatever, but it's like, it's old-time radio.  You can't miss it, man.  You need to check it out.  When I was a kid, I remember one of the ways I used to be punished was that I wouldn't be  allowed to watch TV.  So I got bad grades one time, and I wasn't allowed to watch TV for like a month. 
[00:34:30]  So I was listening to old, they were still doing radio shows.  They were doing them in the 70s, too.  Like, you know, on-air serials, I guess they're called, or a radio show, whatever they're  called, series.  Yeah.  And I got to listen to it when I was like, it was kind of interesting.  You kind of got hooked on it.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, there's no more to that story.  I mean, it really was when I was, it was like in the late 70s, early 80s.  It's me, man.  I think you'll like it, man.  You guys will, man.  All right.  We got an update on Schizo Bill.  Bill.  Hey, what's going on? 
[00:35:00]  You're not the Bill, though.  No, I'm not the Bill.  There's too many Bills in this equation.  Yeah, I know.  I know, there's Bill Burr, who was freaked out by the Schizo Bill bit, and now there's  Bill from Cleveland, who drove, you're the one that drove him down?  Yeah, yeah.  So another Bill drove him down?  Yeah.  All right.  So what happened after the show?  Well, we got outside, he looked at me, and he goes, did I win?  Did I win?  And I told him that he lost to a guy named, that looked like Brian Dennehy.  Yeah.  So is he all right? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, he's all right.  I was a little weirded out when the, when the replay came back on, he started shivering  real bad, and I'm like, oh, this isn't good.  But, yeah.  Oh, no.  He was shivering really, like, bad, but he just said he was cold.  But I had lunch with him yesterday, and he seemed all right.  He was real happy.  He got, like, over 100 friends on MySpace, so he's just happy as can be.  Yeah, join his MySpace account.  It's Schizo Bill, it's MySpace.com, slash Schizo Bill, I think, right? 
[00:36:00]  I think so.  Let's confirm that, so we give the right one plug.  Yeah, let's get this guy a lot of friends, because he gave us an hour of unbelievable radio.  Unbelievable.  It's MySpace.com, slash Schizo Bill, S-K-I-T-Z-B-I-L-L.  Oh, he spells it like, okay.  And by the way, it's funny, speaking of MySpace, Patrice never calls me, or anybody else.  And this is what this self-centered asshole calls me with from Chicago.  If it makes sense, could you mention on the show that I took over the MySpace thing that  that guy started for me? 
[00:36:30]  Oh, he did?  Yeah, so this pompous ass wants you to know that if you join Patrice O'Neill's MySpace,  you're really talking to him.  So I would like you all to rush out Patrice O'Neill on MySpace.  It is now him.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, because it was a fake Patrice.  Yeah, but now you can have the real Patrice not respond to you.  So I read Whackbag all weekend long.  I mean, it was one of those bits where it made me go on Whackbag to check out what everyone  was thinking and stuff, and rave reviews on the Schizo Bill thing.  People seem to enjoy it. 
[00:37:00]  And I think you posted a few times, and you said that he slept all the way back to Cleveland?  Yeah, pretty much.  I mean, he woke up when the replay was on.  Right.  And Bill Burr actually emailed me and asked for his address because he wants to send him  CDs because he feels so bad.  He said, I want to send him CDs and apologies.  Oh, that's going to help.  That's going to help.  We drove this guy on the brink of killing himself and everybody in the studio, and Bill  Burr thinks he'll make everything okay by sending him a comedy CD.  And I can't wait until Schizo Bill hears his act and steals it, and then Bill Burr tries 
[00:37:30]  to confront him, and the guy with the mixed personalities bites his face, chews half of it off.  He just holds Burr, like in a bear hug, and chews his face and does his act back to him.  Dude, I say that because I wanted you to enjoy it.  Hey, Bill, thanks for giving us gold on Friday.  Hey, no problem.  Radio gold.  Anything for the virus.  Thanks, sweetie.  Yeah, and it'll be up on audible.com, like we're saying, and people can download it and  send it to their friends, I guess.  All right, Bill. 
[00:38:00]  All right, see ya.  I can't wait to see what happens on Friday.  Remember, it's an open call for American Mass.  You just show up.  We got promos running like crazy with all the details, okay?  Right.  And check out the videos of Schizo Bill on opieandanthony.com.  People are starting to check those out this morning.  Chris, what's up?  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Pretty good.  Good.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hey, Chris.  Opie, I was just calling to find out if you were related to that Skeeter who's replacing  Michelle Kwan. 
[00:38:30]  Yes, Emily.  Yes.  Is she a member of your family?  She's one of my cousins.  We went over this last Olympics.  Sarah Hughes won the gold.  And now our little sister, Emily Hughes, is in the Olympics because Michelle Kwan's a  crybaby.  She pulled a groin muscle or something, blah, blah, blah, wah, wah, wah, goodbye, go home.  Well, I just want to say good luck to her, and I hope she goes all the way to gold.  All right, man.  A lot of talent in my family.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Bye-bye.  You guys suck.  All right.  Bye, Chris. 
[00:39:00]  Here's Michelle Kwan dropping out of the Olympics.  The Olympics hopes are dashed for Michelle Kwan.  We got some inkling of this yesterday.  She actually had a bad practice, didn't go through her whole routine.  She gave a short press conference after that, talked about how her body really wasn't feeling  up to par.  Now, she came back today to give the bad news.  She was pulling out because of injury.  Now, Kwan was really quite composed as she came out to read a short statement, answer some  questions from reporters.  She almost choked up at one point when she was talking about the toughest decision she 
[00:39:30]  ever had to make.  I have no regrets.  I tried my hardest.  And if I don't win the gold, it's OK.  You know, I've had a great career.  I've been very lucky.  And, you know, this is a sport.  And it's beautiful.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  It's not a sport.  I'm sorry.  Figure skating.  Yeah.  Do it in the park and shut your face.  Ah, she made an eight. 
[00:40:00]  An eight.  Fucking cares.  An eight.  What are you talking about?  Figure eight.  Jesus, an eight.  That was the last time you watched the Olympics.  Exactly.  Why would I?  An eight.  An eight.  It's racist.  Now, it's a very difficult day for Michelle Kwan, who made her decision sometime after  2 a.m.  At 25 years old, she'll probably never have another chance for an Olympic gold, even though  she has both bronze and silver.  Now, United States Olympic Committee Chairman Peter Uberoth calls her a true champion. 
[00:40:30]  Michelle Kwan means more to the United States Olympic Committee than maybe any athlete that's  ever performed for the United States Olympic Committee.  Oh, stop it.  Why?  Well, Emily Hughes will be taking the place of Michelle Kwan.  Go Kwan!  There's obviously a lot of weight on her shoulders.  She heads from her home in Long Island over here to Torino.  As for Kwan, she was really very gracious through all that, even yesterday after she  had that bad practice. 
[00:41:00]  She said, hey, this is a sport.  What we do is entertain people.  Try to have fun doing it.  That's gracious?  Yeah.  That fucking hack response?  Hey, you know, I did the best I could.  Yeah, that's really gracious.  That fucking hack emotion.  Goodbye, Michelle Kwan.  You guys watching the Olympics?  How is she the most important athlete ever?  I don't get it.  Like not getting a gold medal and dropping out because she's injured?  She hurts a twat.  How about the fucking, how about the team that beat the Russians in 1980?  Weren't they a little more important? 
[00:41:30]  Maybe.  For the Winter Olympics?  Who was that little girl that did the...  Mary Lou Retton?  No.  Oh, she's my favorite.  Tara Lipinski?  No, a little cute Tara Lipinski.  Nadia Komenich?  No, no.  The one that hurt her leg and still did the vault?  Oh.  Carrie Struggs.  Carrie Struggs.  Carrie Struggs.  Yeah, but that's like Summer Olympics.  I know, but it's the same thing.  She was injured and she still did her job.  That's right.  Not like this... 
[00:42:00]  Eric Hyden.  What about Eric Hyden?  What about him exactly?  He won everything.  But she's the most important.  She fucking hurts herself giving a happy ending somewhere and she can't compete.  Oh!  Me vagina-hood!  Me vagina-hood!  What a way to go out.  You have to admit to the world that you pulled your twat muscle.  Pulled your twat muscle.  What happened?  I don't know.  I was exercising.  I got my lip caught in my fucking ankle bracelet.  Jesus.  I don't think that's what happened.  What I was doing... 
[00:42:30]  She was probably doing like one of those...  You know how they do like they'll go in a circle and they spin on the thing on the right foot?  Uh, yeah.  She did a split on the ice and she came up and a hunk of ice came with her and her lips  act like a suction cup so she has fucking freezer burn in her box and had to drop out.  That's what happened.  You guys watching the Winter Olympics though?  Not a piece of it I haven't watched yet.  You didn't see the flying tomato?  The flying tomato.  The snowboarder?  Yeah, he won gold last night.  Thank you, CNN.  Thank you, NBC.  Your coverage stinks. 
[00:43:00]  I want to get into the Winter Olympics.  I want to watch.  Oh, I thought you wanted to actually get in.  I was going to say it's a little late.  As what?  Well, the flying tomato, he had to do a second run, right?  In snowboarding to qualify for the finals and then he kicks ass, right?  But if he fucked up in his second run, he wasn't going to be in the finals, which was  like...  Because he was the favorite.  Yeah.  So then he gets into the finals and then stupid Bob Costas jumps on TV and like,  we'll show you the finals a little later, but first it's time to check out the luge. 
[00:43:30]  Yeek.  And then I go, well, all right.  How exciting could the luge be?  You've seen one, you've seen them all.  Well, it could be real exciting if it's the two-man luge.  Hot two-man luge action.  Right.  How do you decide you're good at that?  Yeah.  How do you practice?  You're in the tub one day fucking your boyfriend and you go, you know, this would be fun to  do it in 90 miles an hour. 
[00:44:00]  Someone's suggesting that Michelle Kwan is like the Buffalo Bills of skating.  Kind of true.  Yeah.  Kind of true.  Can't close the deal.  She was a favorite many, many times and just blew it.  Choked under pressure a lot.  That's what Michelle Kwan was good at.  Yep.  Not the most important athlete ever for the Winter Olympics, you groveling committee.  So I'm watching the luge going, what parent would allow their kids to get into the sport  of luge-ing?  Yeah.  It has to be irresponsible parents.  How many in a luge?  It's encouraging.  Huh?  How many in a luge?  How many people? 
[00:44:30]  Oh, there's the one and the two.  Well, you could go one or the two.  They're like teams, like five?  And you're basically-  That's the bobsled.  Oh.  You're basically on your back on a sled going down the tube thing 90 miles an hour with  your groin exposed.  Yeah.  Who the fuck would want to do that?  Your groin exposed to two big hook-like things at the front of the luge.  Right.  I don't get it either.  And then like some dude, they were showing him and he came in fourth place by like a 
[00:45:00]  hundredth of a second.  Yeah.  And then the announcers had the audacity to say, I guess he just didn't have it in him  this time.  What?  The hundredth of a second?  Right.  Is that really his fault?  Right.  Why don't they just-  I guess he didn't push off hard enough.  Yeah.  You have to get a fat partner because you're going downhill.  The fucking fatter your friend is, the faster you're going to go.  That's the key.  Get two big fatzos.  Fat luge.  Well, that's what Anthony brought up.  It's like the two-man luge.  It's got to be the gayest sport ever.  I challenge you right now.  Find a gayer sport than the two-man luge. 
[00:45:30]  You're wearing little uniforms.  Sometimes the thickness is saran wrap.  Big cock is showing through it.  Wow.  And they just, you know, all right, get on me.  And gravity is pulling you down into your partner's tailbone.  Jump on.  You know, they're holding on tight.  Right.  That is really a gay sport.  So anyway, so I wanted to see if the flying tomato won the snowboarding thing.  Yeah.  So I go to Larry King because I'm like, all right, I'm done with the Olympics for a little 
[00:46:00]  while.  I'll go back.  And I'm watching the Growing Pains reunion that Larry had.  And all of a sudden, the goddamn scroll got me.  Oh, it did.  The scroll got me.  Yeah.  Flying tomato wins the gold medal in Torrin or Turin or whatever the fuck the place is.  They reined it for you.  Will you please just do the Olympics in real time?  Please?  No.  Just run it.  They tape everything.  I would DVR the crap out of it and watch it when I want a little later.  I don't know.  They tape it all and then you can't watch anything else because they scroll. 
[00:46:30]  And then they tease it for hours.  Coming up.  To get the best parts of the Olympics every night, you've got to wait until like the last  half hour, 40 minutes.  Yeah.  The rest is just filler bullshit qualifying crap.  But before, we'll go to the qualifying of the snowball throwing competition.  Oh, great.  Good.  But these sports are crazy.  I mean, the ski jump, how do you get into that?  That looks pretty cool.  One day, you just decide, I'm going to just jump.  Hurl myself off a ramp. 
[00:47:00]  Do you ever see these ramps?  How steep they are?  They're amazing.  No one in their right mind would just do that.  And they make a little airfoil out of themselves.  Right.  And they go really, really far.  Do they still have the most ridiculous sport?  What is that?  Where it's cross-country skiing, and then they stop.  And shooting.  Then they stop to shoot at targets, and then get back on their skis to the next target.  Ew.  Do they really?  Yeah.  I think they finally got rid of that sport.  I hear Dick Cheney try to qualify for that one. 
[00:47:30]  First Dick Cheney shooting joke.  It's official.  Yeah, we'll get into the Dick Cheney thing in a little while.  Is that sport still happening, though?  I don't even know the name of it.  It's cross-country skiing, and then you have to, the biathlon?  The biathlon.  That's what it's called?  And then you stop and do some target shooting?  Yeah, you cross-country ski, and shoot.  And then out of nowhere, you just stop and shoot.  You got to shoot.  With the gun you're carrying.  You cross-country ski with a gun over your back, and a little sling, and you do that.  I don't know.  It was popular in a James Bond movie. 
[00:48:00]  It's like a scene at a cliffhanger.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, my God.  It's still happening.  You know, there's a website of events they no longer do in the Olympics that would be  worth finding today.  I know the Winter Olympics had some, I mean, the Summer Olympics had some crazy events  they finally had to get rid of.  Do they do curling still?  Do they still do?  Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep.  Where they throw that weight down the ice, and then the two guys sweep in front of it?  Ew, what is that?  It's a ridiculous-looking Canadian sport. 
[00:48:30]  It's the second most popular sport in Canada, I do believe.  It has hockey, and then curling.  Enough with the ice.  Can you fucking live without the ice up there?  Could you go inside and bowl, people?  Jesus.  Everything in Canada has to revolve around ice.  Play ice chess.  What the fuck's the matter with you people?  Get over it.  It's cold.  They're just moving little ice cubes around.  Yeah.  Oh.  Check.  Get a hold of yourself.  That is very funny.  What do you want to do?  I don't know.  Let's play some mitten tossing.  That's what they do in the summer. 
[00:49:00]  Things that revolve around mittens and hats that they can't wear that they miss.  Hey, throw me your toque.  Let's play hide the snow shovel, eh?  Yeah, that's it.  Print that out.  Yeah, that's the one.  Yeah, where you have to sweep really fast, and then the announces, well, I guess they didn't  have it in them this year.  They didn't sweep.  What?  Sweeping fast enough?  They didn't sweep well enough.  I don't know what the sweeping is.  I don't get that either.  I don't want to know what it's about, so don't call in with that.  It's like bocce.  Tom in Indiana.  Tom?  Yeah, you couldn't, TiVo.  I tried TiVo the opening ceremonies, and it won't let you. 
[00:49:30]  I tried to record it on a VHS tape, and it just blanked it out.  Are you kidding?  What do you mean?  Why?  Oh, I have no idea.  What type of wizardry are they doing over there at the Olympics?  See, I'm looking forward to one of the greatest things is Olympic hockey.  Everyone knows I'm a hockey fan, but Olympic hockey is so much more exciting than the NHL.  It's not even funny.  And what are they going to do?  What are they going to do?  I want those games in real time.  I don't want to fucking have to see that the United States lost or won on a scroll somewhere. 
[00:50:00]  And then watch it.  And then watch it.  It's not worth it to me.  Just can't, are they showing this anywhere in real time?  They used to in the past, like, get some obscure cable channel to run some of this stuff in real time.  And then three in the morning, you could tune in and watch some sports.  Why can't you DVR at a T-Vote?  Well, they might have some kind of block on it.  For what?  No, the problem is by the time they do any coverage, these events are long over.  Yeah.  And, I mean, we live in a day and age now where you can't even turn on your computer without getting Olympic results. 
[00:50:30]  Run on AOL.  Bam!  There it is.  Yep.  So you don't even have a choice if you want to just live in the world we live in.  Yeah, you go to check your mail and boom.  I go outside to get the stupid newspaper and they're scrolling Olympic results on the top of cabs.  It's a different world now, so just show this stuff in real time.  Yeah, I never thought of that on the cab.  You can't avoid it.  You can't avoid the results.  There was a time you could.  You know, 20 years ago you didn't have the computers really and all this other stuff. 
[00:51:00]  A TV, newspaper, and a radio.  Right, but now it's everywhere.  Hi, I'd like to order some peaches.  Well, reverse the Olympic results!  No, shut up.  Yeah.  Well, I challenged people to the gayest sport ever, and we thought it was two-man luge, right?  Yeah.  Well, Matt has one in Indiana.  Matt?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, a couple observations on the Olympics.  Number one, there is one sport gayer than the luge, the male double luge, I should say. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  That's figure skating, of course.  Male figure skating.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, when the guy gets out there alone.  Like male singles, do they do that?  I don't know.  Is there just a guy that goes out there and goes through his dramatic, overdramatic arm  movements and then...  The only thing gayer than that is when they finally go into load catching, where people  just fucking dump loads in their hands and throw it, and you have to catch it like a  seal grabbing a fish.  Oh, nice.  Hey?  One more thing.  I was surprised to see Rocky Dennis win the snowboarding. 
[00:52:00]  That's really good.  Thank you, either, guys?  The Flying Tomato does look like Rocky Dennis a little bit.  Something has been happening with my mic the past couple of weeks.  What?  What?  It...  Oh, I know.  Listen to that.  You might not want to touch that.  Yeah, no shit.  You might not want to touch that.  That didn't happen.  Have you asked for it to be fixed?  No.  Okay, well...  Because I forget what...  Do that again. 
[00:52:30]  Will you guys have...  Yeah, touch that.  Yeah, I don't think that's going to cause a tumor or anything.  That's great.  It's like I'm talking into a fucking taser.  And me and Oprah are just feeling ours, and we're going, all right, well, at least it  doesn't happen with mine.  No, it doesn't...  It doesn't happen when I...  Yeah, okay.  When I touch the bottom metal part.  Not when I touch the foamy part.  But it doesn't go over the air, either.  It's just in here.  It doesn't?  It doesn't go over the air?  All right, people, then you didn't hear that.  But it goes like this.  I'll do it for you.  It's a shock noise.  Yeah, shock noise. 
[00:53:00]  Steve from Waxhack.  Steve?  Yeah, Opie, the ice hockey games are being shown live on USA, MSNBC.  I believe coverage starts tomorrow.  Oh, great.  And USA's on at about 3.30 in the afternoon.  But coverage starts like 4.30 in the morning, so get up early.  I'm telling you, if you have any interest in hockey in general, watch Olympic hockey.  The rinks are much bigger, so there's so much more action.  This is gold.  I taped all the games last time, and I'm doing it again this year.  It's a lot of work.  Thank you. 
[00:53:30]  I love this.  Yeah, I'm glad they found this.  The 10 oddest former Olympic events.  These are events they used to do, and they just said, you know what?  This is just stupid.  These are some of the lamest events.  These were actual events, though, in the Olympics.  You want to read through these?  You could be an Olympic gold medalist in tug-of-war.  From 1900 to 1920 in the Olympics, they did tug-of-war.  Were they wearing those striped one-piece bathing suits on a beach somewhere?  Entertainment for West County Ciderheads during the summer fete? 
[00:54:00]  What is that?  I have no idea.  It's F-E-T-E with like a half of a...  With a hat over one of the E's.  Good, exactly.  Well, no, it's a crooked hat.  It's like a crooked hat.  It looks like the bottom corner of a square turned on its side over the E.  Let's see.  First tug-of-war in 500 B.C.  Modern Olympic rules.  A team of eight had to pull the opposition six feet to win.  But if no such drama had occurred after five minutes, the side would pull their opponent  the furthest triumphed.  London 1908 saw the sport at its most intense when America was beaten in just a few short 
[00:54:30]  seconds by Great Britain.  That's fantastic.  Wait, it's great, though.  The unhappy losers accused Team Great Britain, all of them policemen, of wearing illegal spiked  boots.  Oh.  So we offered them a rematch in our socks and still stuffed them.  Wow.  That is exciting.  Olympic tug-of-war.  Talk about homoerotic. 
[00:55:00]  Because the team, you're all like pulling back and you're all close together, ass on dick,  a bunch of men sweating and pulling.  Pulling and sweating.  And pulling as a big team, as one unit.  Big cracker in the middle.  Yeah.  Motorboating was an Olympic sport in 1908.  That only lasted one year.  How is that showing athleticism?  I don't know, but it seemed to work well in Modesto. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, the Modesto Olympics.  Oh, making good his dismount.  You see the way he ties the cinder block there?  That guarantees the body sinks immediately.  Motorboating.  Wow.  Top speed?  19 miles an hour.  Back in 1908.  Wow.  Lousy British weather meant six out of the nine scheduled races were canceled. 
[00:56:00]  A first-rate flop all around and never to be repeated.  Right.  Motorboating.  And then they tried cricket in 1900.  For one year, they tried the old game of cricket.  Yeah.  And this is a weird sport.  What is this?  They did it in 1904 and 1932.  They decided to bring it back in 1932?  Yeah.  It was an Olympic event called club swinging.  Club swinging?  What the hell is this?  Look, it's funny the way they start.  Not, in fact, a night out for bored couples. 
[00:56:30]  I get it.  It's not that.  It's an event that involves swinging a club festooned with ribbons very quickly around the body and head in a complicated routine.  At the 1932 Games, American George Roth displayed a level of dedication seldom seen in the modern Olympic era.  It was the Great Depression, and Roth was unemployed and hungry.  Yet, he won gold.  Seconds after being awarded his medal in front of 60,000 spectators, he walked out of the stadium in Los Angeles and hitchhiked home. 
[00:57:00]  That's the old days, man.  Solo synchronized swimming they did in 1992.  Solo synchronized?  That's one of those, what?  That doesn't make much sense.  That's one of those oxymorons.  Oxymoron.  Yeah, because synchronized swimming is all about doing the same thing everyone else is doing.  It's just looking like an idiot in the water if you're alone. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Tumbling.  Tumbling was an event in 1932.  Jesus.  Man, there was another event where people had to dive down as far as they can in the water.  Yeah, that's a good one.  And it was getting close to the point where people were drowning and dying, so they had to get rid of that sport.  It's not on this list, unfortunately.  I saw it on another list of wacky Olympic events.  Tumbling, Anthony.  What's that one about?  In 1932, they did this.  Certain black and white era mat events, hands up calisthenics, had all the aerobic verve of school gymnastics certificate 6, which I recall featured skill. 
[00:58:00]  Who's writing these?  Had all the aerobic verve of school gymnastics certificate 6.  Whatever that means.  What's that?  Forward roll, gravity defying, standing up, tumbling, however, was.  No such primary school farce.  American Roland Flip Wolf took gold in L.A. thanks to his revolutionary backflip with double twist, only to see the event flick-flacked off the floor and into gymnastic history in 1932. 
[00:58:30]  Do you think if Heather Mills did a somersault, she would roll one of those gym balls that was uneven and loppy?  A little too much weight on one side.  The rope climb.  Boy, they sure gave this a chance.  Brought it back five times.  1896, 1904, 1906, 1924, 1932. 
[00:59:00]  They tried to bring back the rope climb.  1932 Olympics sucked.  It had that.  It had tumbling.  It had the club swinging.  Jesus, what an awful Olympics.  I guess it was just climbing a rope.  Climb a rope was to shin up to the top of your rope.  And I guess whoever did it fastest?  Well, but then only, like, in 1896, only two climbers made it to the summit, prompting officials to send the rope back for alterations.  Sounds great.  Here's my favorite sport. 
[00:59:30]  They should bring this back.  I'm sure PETA would love this.  Live pigeon shooting.  That rocks.  1900.  They shot pigeons.  That's what they did.  300 poor defenseless pigeons, to be precise.  300.  Wow.  Pest control fans watched in awe as Belgium's Lyon de London won gold, bagging himself a healthily 21 birds. 
[01:00:00]  And presumably a place in RSPB's most wanted list.  Not what that is either.  Respect pigeons, bitch.  Oh.  1906, pistol dueling.  Hey, you know who would be good at this?  Who?  Dick Cheney. 
[01:00:30]  Two Dick Cheney jokes so far.  That's right.  Let's see how many we can get in today.  Pistol dueling.  But this one entry is too good to leave out.  Instead of shooting at each other, participants shot at dummies in fancy frock coats with a bullseye embroidered on the chest.  The event never appeared on the Olympic list again, but qualifies here for its exhilarating oddity.  And then they did a long jump for horses.  Horses long jump?  Who?  Was there someone on the horse? 
[01:01:00]  Because it seems like this is for the horse.  Like this is, is your horse a medal winner?  Ah, Dune.  Ah, Dune.  I don't know.  There you go.  Let's say hi to Tony in New Jersey.  Tony.  Yeah.  What's up?  Uh, barrel jump in.  I remember when I was used to have barrel jump in.  Where the guys would jump over barrels. 
[01:01:30]  Oh yeah, they would skate and then jump over the barrels.  They don't still do that?  Wait, they got rid of that one?  They got rid of that one.  They don't do that no more.  I remember that one.  Oh yeah, that was fun when they'd miss.  That was the best sport because if they didn't miss, they'd add another battle until the guy, you know.  Yeah, until he finally.  Yeah, exactly.  Nuts first on the top of the barrel.  One other thing, uh, that microphone thingy does go out over the air.  Oh!  Okay, thank you, sir.  All right, what?  Oh, I didn't mean to hang up on you.  Call back.  Kevin in Jersey.  Kevin, what's up? 
[01:02:00]  Hey, last night during the, uh, lose, they had a German guy on there which they called the white sausage.  And as he's going, as he, because he's wearing a whole white uniform, as he's going down, my wife was sitting next to me.  He goes, Jesus, look at his cock.  No wonder they call him the white sausage.  They're wearing these suits that are supposed to be very aerodynamic.  So it has to be as tight as possible.  Tight and as thin as possible.  They would do it naked if they could.  Yeah.  It looks like they're just covered in a thin coating of latex.  If they could, they would just duct tape their penis down and go naked. 
[01:02:30]  Oh.  Would you lose with me?  Would you?  I'd lose with me.  Would you?  You need some help with that, uh, luge?  Would you?  Look a little handicapped there.  Thank you.  So your wife commented on that, sir?  Yeah, she was pretty excited.  I tried to explain to her that's probably not what NBC meant.  Yeah, the luge guy.  Hopefully she doesn't say that during the horse jumping.  All right, Kevin.  The white sausage.  He's the guy that rolls over on his belly to stop at the end of the run. 
[01:03:00]  They probably call him that because he's a big dick.  Yeah.  His friends probably call him that.  Like, they call Randy Johnson the big unit because he's a huge cock.  Right.  That's why his name is that.  And he gets in that white suit.  Yeah.  He goes, big dick in there.  Sure.  And then the stupid Germans, that's their idea of funny.  Oh, look.  The white sausage.  The big sausage.  The white sausage is here.  Zell.  Zell.  Let's, uh, say hi to Scott in North Carolina.  Scott.  Hey, good morning, boys.  How y'all doing?  Pretty good, buddy.  All right. 
[01:03:30]  Uh, I got a sport that's gayer than figure skating.  And, uh, I'm not.  It should be on that list of, uh, extinct sports.  Yeah.  Uh, it's, uh, it's that freestyle skiing.  The kind of, they're on a, on a slightly sloped slope.  And, uh, they're just kind of dancing around and using the poles to spring up in the air.  Yeah.  It's like ski ballet.  Uh, it's almost like they want to be on skates and do figure skating stuff on skis.  Yeah.  Boy, that is a good one, sir.  Because that is really gay. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  All right.  I'm not going to be trying out for that.  Uh, this just in, they have equestrian dressage as an event.  What?  And it's horse dancing.  You get on your horse, and do you know anything more about this, Than?  Because Than gave me that.  Equestrian dressage?  Dressage, actually.  Dressage?  Yes.  I pronounced that right.  You didn't put the accent thing over the A.  Exactly.  I apologize.  Way to correct the boss.  Who knows?  I'm helping.  I'm glad I didn't know how that was pronounced.  No, just call Anthony Stupid in front of two countries. 
[01:04:30]  Dressage.  Dressage, you shouldn't know that.  I absolutely shouldn't.  And that's the one where someone's on a horse, and they make the horse just prance around.  Yeah.  Gaily.  And sort of crisscross his feet and whatnot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yuck.  Faggot horse.  Fuck a man in the ass and send him to the hospital.  Douchey horse.  You're trying to get it to dance.  It's whinnying.  Fucking hate horses.  All right.  We should take a break, don't you think?  All right.  It's our Olympic coverage. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, it's messy, Ope.  Jesus.  I know, I just took a cap on.  I just took my hat off.  We get that static electricity where your hair's all every witch away.  It was one of those days.  Fuck the shower.  Just go to work.  I never shower before I come here.  Ever.  Bed head.  Never, ever.  No, why would I?  Yeah.  I go home, take a nap, then shower.  Showers for nighttime.  Well, we mentioned the curling thing.  Bill in Connecticut.  We mentioned curling.  Yeah.  That's the sweep sport, right?  Bill?  Bill?  Bill?  Bill.  All right.  Bill? 
[01:05:30]  Bill?  Bill.  Where's the stopwatch?  I'm going for the record today.  Oh.  Who has the record so far?  Jimmy?  Fucking Jimmy.  Jimmy.  A minute 57.  Of course.  How long?  A minute 57?  Yeah, I laugh at his record.  You think you could make two minutes?  Don't look at my penis.  Just let him look at it.  It's only for work.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show in just a bit. 
[01:06:00]  Man?  Stop pushing.  Yeah, we'll see what happens with that.  Let's say hi to Kent, the movie guy.  Kent, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How's it going?  Pretty good.  How are you today, bro?  I'm good.  I'm good.  Yeah, I got a bunch of new rumors, a bunch of new gossip about new movies coming out in  the near future.  Well, I'm very excited.  That's all well and fine, Kent, but I'm very excited at the movie that was number one this  week in the box office.  That's right.  Which one?  What do you think was number one? 
[01:06:30]  King Kong?  No.  Yeah, good job, Jimmy.  Number one.  Pink Panther, of course.  Well, back.  No.  Pink Panther.  And here comes the headline.  Oh.  Here comes the headline, everybody.  Yes, a nation.  Pink Panther claws its way to top spot.  You know what?  Yeah, boy, was it garbage.  You can't fault Hollywood for making it.  God damn it.  The American public, you dumb motherfuckers.  Hollywood knows how stupid you are. 
[01:07:00]  They sat there and watched that piece of shit.  Good.  And probably all laughed.  Look at them falling down the stairs.  Fucking assholes.  But Hollywood, you know what?  They're in the business to make money, not have integrity.  And if this dog shit didn't make money, they wouldn't make it.  And you fucking dummies out there that are going to see the Pink Panther.  I hope everyone who went and saw that was somehow paralyzed in a car accident on the way home.  You and your fucking dates, assholes. 
[01:07:30]  Jimmy, does that include me?  No, because there's a difference between when you're going to actually review something and, well, you know the difference.  You know what?  Yeah, yeah.  People just go to laugh.  Nothing else was in the movie theater, though.  Exactly.  Which is better.  That's the problem.  It's a weird time of year.  I went to my movie theater two or three times in the last week, I guess, just wanting to see a movie.  I'm like, I've either seen the movie, movies that they have listed, and then the rest of them, I'm like, I don't want to see anything in this crap. 
[01:08:00]  So you didn't sit through anything?  I'm not going to sit through the Pink Panther.  I refuse.  I refuse to sit through that.  Do you think they put it out at a time when they knew nothing else was really happening?  Of course.  Here's the thing that happened with the Pink Panther.  They made it over a year ago.  I mean, it's been done for forever.  What happened was Sony bought MGM, and it ended up sitting on a shelf.  This movie was done, and Steve Martin was able to go shoot another movie and release it before this movie came out.  Sitting on a shelf?  It was sitting on a shelf.  Look, I said shoof, funny.  Oh, I said a shelf. 
[01:08:30]  No, a shelf.  That's a funny everyman look you have.  That is what I said.  Shoof.  Oh, you got it.  Shut up.  Hold on a minute.  We got a guy.  I'm going to put him on the line with you.  George in Colorado saw the movie.  George?  Yeah.  A friend of mine is a manager at an AMC theater, and he got me in for free.  No excuses.  No excuses.  I know.  I walked out 15 minutes into the movie and told him I wanted my money back for my popcorn and soda.  It sucked so bad.  Good job.  You tell him.  What was the part that made you go, you know what? 
[01:09:00]  This ain't getting any better.  I got to get the hell out of here.  The whole fucking thing.  Really?  I don't even remember what I thought.  It was so bad.  And to make matters worse, it was a matinee show, and a bunch of fucking shogies were in  there and would not shut up.  Oh, of course they were in there.  Beyonce is in the movie.  Colorado?  Oh, fuck.  That made it even worse yet.  It's like I walked out.  I said, no, did not shut up.  The movie sucked.  And my friend was like, man, I'm sorry. 
[01:09:30]  He says, you know.  Yeah.  And I talked to him last night, and he said the movie isn't even selling out.  So I don't see how it's number one.  Well, it only made $21 million.  I mean, usually a movie when it's number one for the weekend makes a lot more than that,  but it's a slow movie season right now.  You got the Olympics dropping on Friday.  Most people stay in.  Plus, the weather is bad around this time.  Sir, did you just use the word drop?  Yeah.  Sir.  What? 
[01:10:00]  The only thing that should drop.  I don't even want to do the joke.  I apologize.  It was going to be completely tasteless and just no reason.  Of course it was.  And there'd be no reason for it.  Did you just censor yourself?  Only because it was like one of those things you're going to say.  It's like this is so out of place and so for no reason to do a miscarriage joke in  the middle of a movie review.  Yes.  I knew that miscarriage joke was coming.  And I couldn't word it properly fast enough.  Feel free next time.  All right.  Go ahead and interrupt me.  Yeah.  This weekend, though, you got some good movies. 
[01:10:30]  You got, God, my brain is freezing, Nightwatch, which is a Russian film that is going to blow  everyone away.  No, it's not.  Why is this going to blow everyone away?  It is.  It's a Russian film that is like in the same vein as The Matrix.  It's got amazing special effects.  Really cool story.  What do they know about special effects over there?  Yeah, they do, though.  That's weird.  Great.  Much better than your American movies.  We do everything better.  You watch. 
[01:11:00]  Russian movie will be so much better.  No, seriously.  I sat through the film and I was amazed the whole time.  It was just unbelievable.  Subtitles?  It is subtitled.  That's it.  I like going to the movies and reading.  I want to read for two hours.  That's what I like to do.  Well, then, gosh.  I'll have to wait for the dubbed version.  That's going to be awful.  Dang, I'm really bombing here.  No, you're not.  You just talk about movies, dude.  I'm serious.  There's no bombing or killing. 
[01:11:30]  You're just discussing film.  There's no way to...  Okay, cool, cool, cool.  I'm nervous.  I'm a nervous Nancy.  What else came out?  You had Firewall with Harrison Ford.  It wasn't a perfect film, but it was probably the best thing that came out.  I'm hearing it's getting good reviews.  It's getting mixed reviews.  A lot of people are saying it's stupid.  It's really not well written.  It's contrived.  It's boring.  A lot of other people, on the other hand, are saying this is exactly what we need at  this time.  It's a little bit of action just to throw out there.  A lot of people like seeing Harrison Ford back up on the screen after his past couple 
[01:12:00]  bombs.  It was K-19 bombed, and yeah, Hollywood homicide bombed.  You know what movie I want to see?  I'm going to go to my artsy theater where they serve the smoked salmon sandwiches.  Smoked salmon sandwich.  Instead of popcorn, you get a smoked salmon sandwich.  And what are you going to see?  Why We Fight.  That's a good movie.  It is?  That's a good movie.  All my friends that have seen it have just said good things.  Pretty much a documentary on war.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, and Why We Fight.  Wow.  By the way, the Rotten Tomatoes, 88% are bad, and man, are they fucking great. 
[01:12:30]  Just castrations of that douchebag, Steve Martin.  Yeah, the best website for movie reviews, RottenTomatoes.com by far.  You've got to give it up to them for just giving you the truth.  Because a lot of critics just won't, you know, the mainstream critics just won't pan something.  They won't give in and say, hey, this really, really sucks.  You've got to find those niche, you know, critics like myself and several other guys that will just give you the brutal, honest truth. 
[01:13:00]  Like you're doing today?  Yeah.  I mean, a lot of people are going to say, hey.  You're outrageous.  It's great.  Really going out on a limb.  So we've got to say it's amazing, you know, it sucks.  Well, dude, there's one right here from the Chicago Sun Tire.  He's getting blasted in real publications.  Yep.  At every moment in the movie, I was aware that Peter Sellers was Clouseau and Steve Martin was not.  I hadn't realized how thoroughly Sellers and Edwards had colonized my memory. 
[01:13:30]  The LA Weekly said, oh, that's a stupid one, wafflemovies.com.  I think I have laughed for funerals, which is somewhat appropriate for this movie.  The Pink Panther is a funeral for Steve Martin's dignity and soul.  Wow.  Filmcritic.com.  Steve Martin should have his SAG card revoked for even attempt to fill Sellers' shoes.  That's exactly what you did, shithead.  You could kind of spin those, though, to be positive.  Yeah, you possibly can.  Maybe Sellers had smelly feet.  Sellers, he's trying to, that was awful. 
[01:14:00]  I think there might have been some humorous funerals somewhere at some time.  Movie Mom at Yahoo Movies.  This is less like Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards and more like Ernest Goes to Paris.  Oh.  Whoa.  Well, a couple of those Ernest movies got a chuckle out of me.  They were terrific.  Arizona Republic, the Pink Panther doesn't mess around.  It goes south in a hurry.  Ha ha.  Let's say hi to Momo.  Momo.  Hey, good morning, boys.  What's up, Momo?  Hey, first of all, Daddy, I've been a bad boy, and I need you to spank me. 
[01:14:30]  Jimmy?  Why?  I've been a bad boy.  Can you help me?  Sure.  Anyway.  Hey!  Okay, terrific.  Well, I'm a spanking, I'm a hack when I spank.  I say hack things.  Oh.  Like, ooh, you're bad.  Yeah, you like that.  You like that.  You're naughty!  Give it to him, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Well, what I wanted to chime in about was two things.  First of all, we got, and I live in Memphis, and we got about four inches down there, and 
[01:15:00]  I'll tell you what, you talk about how to paralyze the city, the, you can throw a cup of water  on the interstate in Memphis, then you'll have an accident.  And when we get any kind of weather, it's just, the people do not know how to do it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Could you, um, hold on, this audio is, yeah, what'd you say about, uh, water or something?  You broke up.  Your phone stinks, dude.  Yeah.  God.  All right, I'll say it one more time so you can slam me.  I said, you can throw a cup of water on the interstate in Memphis, and you'll cause an 
[01:15:30]  accident.  Oh!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Oh!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Oh!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Good Lord.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  That's horrific!  Don't you have a morning zoo in your town you could have called up?  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Oh, a cup of water on the interstate!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  We'll cause a, that's impossible, sir. 
[01:16:00]  We'll cause a five-car pileup.  Need a little more than a cup, wouldn't you agree?  We do love exaggerated humor on this show, but that one is quite frankly impossible.  That's right.  If you throw a thimble of water out of a plane, it would drown a bunch of people.  No, it wouldn't.  Don't want it, sir.  It's called hyperbole.  But anyway.  Oh.  It's not, it's called what?  Hyperbole.  Nice big word.  Hyperbole?  Yes.  Anyway.  That's hyperbole, sir.  That's what a, that's what a bully can't settle down. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, that's right.  But anyway, the whole thing about, uh, your, your movie guy was saying about how Harrison  Ford is mostly getting good reviews with the, uh, Firewall movie.  Right.  I, I am so fucking sick.  I used to be a real good, a real big fan of Harrison Ford, but I'm so fucking sick of him  doing the same role over and over and over and over since Indiana Jones is, he's just this  angry guy who all he can do is just stare at the camera with this supposedly like tough 
[01:17:00]  guy look and, and, and speak with clenched teeth.  And that's all he does anymore.  All he's doing is try to avenge something or rescue someone.  It's like, oh, fuck yourself.  Here's when I started to hate Harrison Ford.  Shame on you, Mr. President.  Oh yeah.  You fucking angry douchebag.  Shut up.  I thought, I swear when I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought I had seen this movie  before.  You had.  I was like, wait, wait a minute.  This whole storyline, everything is another movie. 
[01:17:30]  It's dreck.  Yeah.  But anyway, gentlemen, you guys suck.  They love you.  We'll talk to you later.  Godspeed.  Careful, that cup of water.  Jersey Mike, what's up?  Hey, I called to plug the world's fastest Indian.  That is a great movie.  Good job, Mike.  Good.  What?  Pat him on the back.  You couple of lugers.  Oh, lugers.  Let's wrap in.  I like that.  For the rest of the Winter Olympics, let's call people lugers.  Fucking luger.  Yeah.  You gotta see skeleton sled. 
[01:18:00]  That's even worse than luge.  It's fucking face first.  Wait, let me ask you a question.  Yeah, but I can handle face first.  Oh.  Well.  Fuck, guy.  I'm sure you can, sir.  Who the fuck would go in there back down that thing?  That track?  Yeah.  Well, let me ask you a question.  The fastest Indian is an Anthony Hopkins movie, right?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, it's gonna be good, then.  No, it is good.  I don't think he's ever made a bad movie, Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Him and Chris Rock did a movie together where they played, like, FBI agents.  Okay. 
[01:18:30]  Okay.  Bad movie.  Yeah.  The buddy movie formula is so done.  You ever see Magic?  Magic is fun.  We are dead.  Yeah.  Magic is a great movie.  I haven't seen that in years.  Pocus.  Pocus.  Does anybody...  This is what I would like to see.  He's dead.  I would love to have the trailer for that.  If anybody has, like, what the movie trailer used to be for Magic.  Is there a place to find that?  Yeah.  There has to be.  Everything you can imagine is somewhere residing on the net.  And also that I want to request in the Tom Likas audio from Bullshit when he was on 
[01:19:00]  Pan and Teller because they showed him talking normal.  And then they show him on the air in his radio voice.  Jacking like this.  And it's the most fucking embarrassing thing I've ever seen someone...  You have it, Sweetie Hawk?  Well, how about now, Hawk?  You have that?  All right.  Very good.  God bless you.  All right.  Anything else, Kent?  Well, you guys were talking about Anthony Hopkins just now.  He is reprising his role as Hannibal Lecter again.  No, he's not.  No.  Yeah, he is.  But this time, it's not just him playing Hannibal Lecter.  It's young Hannibal behind the mask. 
[01:19:30]  And it's Hannibal through three different times in his life from World War II up until  when we saw him get captured in Red Dragon.  Oh, so it's going to be him kind of looking back and...  Yeah, it's...  Being played by Jared Leto or somebody.  Like, what actor are they going to get to play the young one?  It's a young one by the name of Gaspard Yuliel.  What?  Yeah, exactly.  It's Gaspard Yuliel.  Can't we just get some kid from the OC to really ruin it? 
[01:20:00]  I don't...  Yeah.  I don't think they would...  As long as they don't ask Brian Cox to have any part of it, that no picture taken motherfucker.  How does that feel, shithead?  Four fucking movies now, and you're not in any of them.  Good.  Yeah, he's nowhere to be seen.  How about this?  Enough with Hannibal Lecter.  Yeah.  We get it.  Stop.  Fava beans.  All right.  Interesting.  Kent, we're going to let you go.  Thank you.  Thank you, Kent.  Great.  See you on, guys.  All right.  Bye.  First movie, great.  Amazing.  The rest of them, stinkeroo.  Shite.  The old...  A bunch of shite. 
[01:20:30]  Stinkeroo.  Kenny.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  My condolences to Anthony, the guy who wrote Jaws, died.  Yeah.  Peter Benchley.  Here's the story.  Peter Benchley, the author of Jaws, has died.  Benchley's most famous novel-turned-blockbuster film terrorized millions of swimmers, even as the  author himself became an advocate for the conservation of sharks.  Benchley died last night at his Princeton, New Jersey home after battling a progressive  lung disease.  The native New Yorker began his writing career at the Washington Post and Newsweek and spent 
[01:21:00]  two years as a speechwriter for President Johnson.  Benchley was 65.  65 only?  That's a shame.  That's not a good contract.  He wrote for Lyndon Johnson.  Did he?  Yeah, he said for President Johnson.  Oh.  How about that?  That's right.  He was in Jaws, too, played the news guy on the beach.  Lyndon Johnson?  Yes, Lyndon Baines Johnson was indeed.  Wait, he was in that movie?  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  He was the news guy that walked up on the beach, talked about the killer shark. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that was him with his little cameo.  Ooh.  That's horrible.  He died of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive and fatal scarring of the lungs.  Was he a smoker?  I don't know.  That doesn't sound like something you get from smoking.  How do your lungs get scarred?  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis comes up on you.  Can't breathe.  Can't catch a breath. 
[01:22:00]  Remember, saw a buddy of mine at the supermarket.  Went up, tapped him on the shoulder.  He turned around, coughed blood up on me.  That's when I knew he had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  He just coughed up some phlegm and then disappeared into the produce aisle.  I never saw him again.  I'll never take cough medicine again.  Let's drink to your lungs.  Let me see your scar.  I'll turn you inside out. 
[01:22:30]  Poor bastard.  There's got to be a hell of a way to go.  Yeah.  It doesn't sound fine.  Lung scarred.  You can't catch a breath.  Maybe that's what I have because I have trouble breathing sometimes.  No.  You have hypochondria.  All right.  I don't want idiopathic diseases.  No.  Scars go in your lungs.  Lungs go in your body.  Try to breathe.  I got nothing.  You had plenty on that. 
[01:23:00]  Jesus.  I couldn't even say it.  You did five minutes on it.  You don't have to do 20 minutes on everything.  That's pretty impressive.  There's some great lines there.  Only so much you can do with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  And we haven't even tapped it.  Right.  All right.  And then, of course, the big story today.  It's on the front page of all the papers.  Oh, yeah.  The snow.  Well.  This is just going to be for months.  Yeah.  Leno, Letterman.  Conan.  Conan. 
[01:23:30]  Jon Stewart.  This is all just for months.  They are going to pound the fact that Dick Cheney shot his friend.  And can I already say, we all know the alternative comics are going to go, too bad he wasn't hunting  with President Bush, to which the fucking John Lennon glasses boring audience will clap.  We get it.  Yes.  You don't like the president, man.  Man. 
[01:24:00]  Predictable shitheads.  Daily News headline.  Yeah.  Says, duck, it's dick.  Oops.  Cheney shoots pal during hunt.  That would only be a funny headline if it was for a rape.  Hey, could Ben or somebody get the headlines from all over America, from your local paper?  Because they've got to be having a lot of fun with this headline today.  New York Post has big shot.  Because, you know, he's a big shot. 
[01:24:30]  And he shot his friend.  Right.  Cheney wounds hunting buddy in accident.  I can't wait.  Channel 5's tease last night made me sick.  Two teases they had.  The first was the Dick Cheney story.  They go, Dick Cheney wounds a man in a shooting.  We'll tell you why the shot was fired and the condition of his victim.  Like, in that whole thing, you could have said it was a hunting accident and the guy is okay.  But it said they make you think it might have been an intruder.  Intruder.  A terrorist.  Something. 
[01:25:00]  Right.  Tabloid shitheads.  And then their other thing was a stupid fucking weatherman.  After the big blizzard we had here, it stopped.  Most snow ever.  He goes, well, the big blizzard's over, but more snow in the forecast?  Don't put those shovels away.  I'll tell you about it.  And I saw the 10-day forecast.  There isn't a spot of snow in it.  We're supposed to get up to 50 degrees on Wednesday and Thursday.  This guy just trying to get more people to view through lying. 
[01:25:30]  Pure and simple lies.  So there's no snow?  No snow?  He finally admitted later on?  I couldn't even watch, but I'm sure it was somewhere upstate in a valley or somewhere.  It wasn't for the viewing area that watches Channel 5 News.  It wasn't for the people digging out of two feet of snow in Manhattan.  Liar.  Liar.  Here's the Dick Cheney story.  The shooting happened around 5.30 Saturday afternoon in Texas.  Apparently, the vice president had no idea the fellow hunter had approached him from behind. 
[01:26:00]  A few seconds later, Cheney opened fire.  Vice President Dick Cheney took aim at a covey of quail that had just taken flight.  But a member of his hunting party stepped into the line of fire and was blasted with several shotgun pellets.  A bird flushed.  The vice president took aim at the bird and shot.  And unfortunately, Mr. Whittington was in the line of fire and got peppered pretty well.  78-year-old Austin attorney Harry Whittington was part of a group hunting birds on a ranch in South Texas 
[01:26:30]  when the accident occurred late Saturday afternoon.  The shooting was witnessed by the ranch's owner, who said Cheney turned to fire and ended up peppering Whittington's cheek, neck, and chest.  As the vice president and the other hunter approached the second covey, Mr. Whittington decided to try to join them.  You know what?  That good.  I'm glad he got shot.  Fucking 70-year-old wasp. 
[01:27:00]  He's been doing nothing but fucking people his whole life and mingling with the rich and elite.  Man!  You know what, though?  Fuck him.  78-years-old, can you stop shooting birds already?  Play with your grandkids and have a peach and be lucky you're not shitting your pants.  Fucking creep.  Jimmy hates when animals are harmed.  No, I don't.  I just hate when they're harmed by a bunch of...  For no reason.  If you're going to eat it, fine.  They eat quail.  Ah, they're not eating quail.  And dove and whatever else they were hunting.  No, they're just being douchebags.  Nothing better to do. 
[01:27:30]  Fucking idiots.  I like how they tried to make it seem like it was really nothing, even though the guy  was injured.  Apparently not that bad.  But when you turn shooting...  And you know it was all rehearsed.  The White House had to go over how this was going to be released.  And don't say shoot or shot or hit.  Can we just say peppered?  He was peppered.  Peppered.  Peppered?  That sounds kind of nice.  That doesn't sound bad at all. 
[01:28:00]  We don't like a little pepper on our food.  Ah-choo!  Ah-choo!  It makes you sneeze.  That's what I see in the cartoons.  Yeah.  Sprinkle a little pepper.  He was shot.  He was shot by the vice president.  Yeah, remember when JFK was peppered?  Peppered in the head.  Yeah.  A little...  But that was that big pepper mill.  Yeah.  Hit him in the head, I think.  Made his skull look like a Western omelette.  Jesus.  A lot of pepper.  Here's Dick Cheney apologizing.  Secret service agents guarding the vice president gave first aid to Whittington until the paramedics arrived. 
[01:28:30]  Cheney is said to have stood by the fallen hunter.  And the ranch owner says Cheney was, quote, very apologetic.  He had to stand by.  What's he going to do, go?  He's got that weak heart.  He wasn't going to run off.  Hey, there's another covey over here.  I'm thinking of going, you know, just because you seem all right.  I could get some more birds.  Here's some more birds that did nothing but land.  Why don't I go shoot them?  I'm glad that old fucking wasp took a bullet.  They reported like they're surprised he stood by his pal. 
[01:29:00]  After he peppered him.  He was treated immediately.  The vice president has a wonderful medical team that travels with him, and they were right on the spot.  Following the shooting, Cheney spent most of his Sunday at a Texas hospital, keeping Whittington company.  Whittington is known in Texas as a longtime supporter of the Republican Party in that state, and was even appointed to several state boards.  He is expected to make a full recovery.  The vice president is an avid hunter. 
[01:29:30]  He makes annual trips to South Dakota to hunt pheasants.  And the owner of the Texas ranch where the shooting happened says he visits her property about once a year.  Asshole.  Imagine if he killed this guy.  Oh, it happens all the time.  Yep.  They go out there hunting people not really paying attention, especially birds, because you're moving.  It's a moving target.  So you're moving left to right, right to left.  You've got to keep tabs on where everybody in your party is at all times. 
[01:30:00]  And if there's any doubt, you don't take the shot.  That's how it works.  Don has a bone to pick with Jimmy.  Who cares?  Hey, Jimmy, what do you think?  You think Dick Cheney could go home and play with his grandchildren?  Oops, he doesn't have any.  Dick Cheney doesn't?  I think you were talking about the guy that got shot.  Yeah, I was.  I think his daughter's gay.  His daughter's gay.  Okay.  Hey, now there's two people that are afraid of Dick.  Wait, is that the third joke? 
[01:30:30]  That's the third Dick Cheney joke.  All right.  Well, I wonder if she got peppered in the face when she was young, and that's why she likes girls.  That's poor.  Even better.  What would have happened if it was reversed and the guy shot Dick Cheney?  Would he have been a terrorist?  Man, the Secret Service would have wrestled him to the ground.  I'm sure they would have.  Shot him dead and called him Osama.  Why, sir?  Why?  I tolerated you yammering over my lines because you have a good heart. 
[01:31:00]  Let's go to Anthony in Columbus.  Anthony.  Hi, sir.  I'm just calling about the non-news bullshit they've been throwing out there lately.  Yeah.  They actually had a teaser in Columbus that celebrities got caught at the fucking airport because of the weather.  That is absolutely the epitome of how shitty the life is around here, but the news in general.  Did they show any celebrities stuck at the airport?  Celebs.  I don't think so.  I think they just teased us that there might be celebrities at the airport. 
[01:31:30]  Great.  There was probably some awful celebrity.  Man, what a nightmare, though.  You hear people at LaGuardia, which was still closed last I heard.  It had been closed since, I guess, early Sunday.  And what do you do?  You know how bad it is to be at an airport when you're delayed like an hour or two,  and you're sitting in those chairs that are custom-made to not be comfortable in  because they don't want people laying down or anything.  Sure.  What do you do?  What do you do when it's days that you've got to sit there? 
[01:32:00]  Well, like, after 9-11, it must have been atrocious because at least with snow, you know,  look, there's snow.  There's nothing you can do.  Yeah.  It's almost like you can't get angry because it's fucking snow.  But where do you go?  Where do you sleep?  On the floor?  You wait in line to sit and smell everybody else's shit just like everybody else's do.  Some of the headlines from across America, by the way, Casper, Wyoming, Cheney, Baggs,  Lawyer.  Gotta love Wyoming.  That's a good one.  Fort Worth, Texas, no imagination. 
[01:32:30]  Cheney shoots man in hunting accident.  Oh, just the facts.  Just the facts.  Faggots.  North Carolina, Raleigh, Cheney sprays hunter with birdshot.  That's pretty good.  Sprays.  Good old Boston.  And Cheney accidentally shoots hunting partner.  Boring.  So.  We get.  And in San Francisco, murderer almost kills another. 
[01:33:00]  Let's go to Andrew in Georgia.  Andrew.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  I heard earlier on the news that Cheney's people weren't going to actually release the  information yet.  And that a newspaper in Texas published the story before they had a chance to even get  their shit together.  How do you in this day and age, sir?  It is very hard to keep a secret that the vice president shot somebody.  Exactly.  Yeah, I know, but I guess they didn't have their shit together yet.  Especially when EMS guys are called, you know, to take care of it. 
[01:33:30]  And as a matter of fact, the woman that owns the property said that, well, you know, EMS  was called, but we'd have probably handled it a little differently if somebody else, you  know.  So, this happens all the time.  People get peppered.  I've been peppered before and, you know, trying to make it sound like it's just completely  nothing.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  A shotgun blast to the face, neck and chest.  So, that right there tells you it's a little more than just, because the pellets, it's not 
[01:34:00]  a single bullet when you're hunting birds.  It's spray.  It's spray.  It's a bunch of BBs.  Yeah.  But, and it's happened where you shoot up, BBs come down, you might get hit on the head  with one or something like that.  But if you're getting hit in the face, the neck and the chest, you're kind of still in  that range where the BBs haven't spread out all that far, you know. 
[01:34:30]  So, I think it's just a little more serious than they're trying to make it seem.  Of course.  Leo in Cleveland.  Leo.  What's up, guys?  I said, I'm just calling to say, I got a joke that Dick Cheney, if he got shot, the  guy who was shot would be a dick beater.  Wait, say that again.  Your phone crept out.  I said, the guy, if it was turned around, the guy who shot, Dick Cheney shot, shot him,  he would be a dick beater.  Dude, are you talking on a cell phone? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Well, dude, you got to, I heard the guy who shot him, scribble, scribble, scribble, scribble.  You got to go slow.  And it's hard to hear you.  So, you got to just make sure we're hearing you.  Talk into the phone better.  Okay.  The guy who shot Cheney would be a dick beater.  Heater?  Who's got a heater, dude?  I can't hear you.  Yeah.  Go to the, do you have a window nearby?  The signal is all crackly.  The signal is really bad.  Can you hear us?  Dude, can you hear us clearly?  What's that? 
[01:35:30]  Hello, hello.  Can you hear us?  Yeah, I can hear you guys.  Okay, there you are.  There you are.  Wherever you are right now, it sounds good.  Yeah.  All right, one more time.  Sorry, man.  Okay.  The guy who shot Cheney would end up being a dick beater.  If he shot him, I said it.  Oh, you stink. 
[01:36:00]  Four times, you dope.  Let's go to Georgia, Arizona.  What a complete asshole.  Fucking awful joke.  He'd be a dick beater.  He thought it was so good.  Cricket, you shithead.  Four times.  Hope he had shot in the face.  Let's go to Arizona.  George? 
[01:36:30]  Hey, guys.  How about Big Spray's friend and face?  All right.  That's not bad.  He's not going to follow the big laugh we're having, but it's actually not a bad line.  But I wouldn't say it's terrific.  No.  As soon as I heard you guys wrecking that guy, I said, oh, great.  Here I am.  You're next.  Now you better have confidence in your dick jokes, man.  Let's go to Texas.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to confirm Anthony's idea there that they're playing this down quite a bit. 
[01:37:00]  Because when you're quail hunting with guys, you're usually in pretty close proximity with each other.  Yeah.  And what he did, in my idea, this is what he did, is when you swing on those birds, sometimes they don't bust the right way.  And he swung and shot that guy, like, you know, close.  Like, I didn't just walk into his line of fire, you know.  Yeah, they're trying, they really are trying to make it sound like the guy is responsible for getting shot instead of Dick Cheney being responsible for shooting him. 
[01:37:30]  Exactly.  You know, he must have swung around, birds got flushed, he swung around and paid no attention to what was in his line of fire, except for those birds.  He's a doddering old asshole who has his finger on the button of the free world.  He swung around with a rifle and just shot it.  And whoever happened to be there.  Shotgun, Jimmy.  Whatever the fuck it was, he shouldn't be holding it.  He should be holding his prostate. 
[01:38:00]  Fucking himself.  Asshole.  Fucking innocent birds mining their own beeswax, just fucking chirping and shitting on each other.  And I hate birds.  They're fucking faggots.  Filthy animals.  Birds are faggots.  They're dumb dinosaur skeletons.  They make me sick.  Fucking queers.  The bottom line is, though, you don't go around fucking shooting them.  And they probably raise them.  Oh, Dick's, Vice President's coming.  Let's get the ranch all ready.  It fucking doddering old cunt lands and just murders everything on the farm and then goes home. 
[01:38:30]  Helping his fucking heart stops.  Holy shit.  The old guy enjoys doing a little hunting.  Exactly.  It's like this fucking stupid suit jacket with pockets on the, there's those little patches.  See, I understand like Ted Nugent type of hunting.  I really do.  That, yeah.  But I'm with you with these.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, Uncle Ted, I'll be in charge.  You must be a liberal.  I'm Uncle Ted.  Just settle down.  I'll wear the animal.  God, let's get home safe.  Let me do all the talking. 
[01:39:00]  You do the walking.  Thank you very much.  All right.  We know.  You're a firecracker.  But I'm definitely, you nailed something though.  I'm definitely not a fan of the going to a farm where they set it up all nice for you.  And they raised them.  They said he also took some heat for shooting as many 70 pen-raised pheasants on a 2003 Pennsylvania hunt.  Pen-raised pheasant.  Yeah, they raise these things.  And then they release them.  Because they know he's coming June 15th.  So they probably fucking raised them and their legs are all tired and shit because they're sitting in a pen. 
[01:39:30]  They're not wild pheasants.  No.  They're all fucking fat.  They're big and juicy.  They probably throw yellow dye on them so this fucking ancient cocksucker can find them.  They've been suffering for a couple of years.  They finally open the gate to the pen and they think they're free.  They're so used to humans feeding them, they walk right up to you.  Yeah, and he fucking shoots them while they're putting it out of their hand for a shake.  They're trying to get a picture with the vice president and he kills them.  The feeder that they give them in the pen looks like a shotgun barrel so they automatically stick their little beak into it.  They show pictures of Dick Cheney and if the bird walks up to it, they get their feathers tussled and petted. 
[01:40:00]  He's shooting pterodactyl.  I would respect him if he was doing that.  Very good, Jimmy.  I hope he's trampled by an elephant.  All right, we should take a break.  We have Oprah talking about XM on the way.  Perfect segue.  We have Leno doing a monologue about Oprah and XM.  And we have a voicemail from Jim Norton's X that we were going to play Friday. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, wow, yeah.  We were going to play this Friday in the last hour, but then we decided to just screw around with Schizo Bill.  We went long form on everybody on Friday.  Yes.  That's the beauty of satellite radio.  Every once in a while, you can just take a big, big chance and see what happens.  Schizo Bill, by the way, will be available on Audible.com later this morning.  And videos are up on openinganthony.com.  I love Audible.  Why is Matt Lauer outside cooking?  To see fucking morning shows.  Hey, look at that.  Hey, he's in Torino for the Olympics.  Oh, they're in Italy. 
[01:41:00]  So spaghetti.  You got to get the local fare.  I hope somebody back in like 80 years ago, there's a vendetta against him.  Come up and just stab him in the stomach and slice him up to his chest.  Antonio Andolini.  Antonio Andolini.  Oh, we got an O-Town.  We got an O-Town headline for Dick Cheney.  Bring it on, brother.  O-Town.  What's up, Matt?  Yeah, the paper right here deported as Dick Season, Lawyer Season. 
[01:41:30]  They did not.  Duck Season, Rabbit Season, Dick Season, Lawyer Season.  Is that really a headline or is that your joke?  Of course not.  Come on.  That could be ridiculous.  You never know, though.  That's true.  Good point.  You know, if they do anything humorous about this on CNN, we are going to have to do news.  Because it'll be dick jokes.  And I always said, if they're doing dick jokes on CNN, we're doing hard-hitting news.  Bah, bah, birds. 
[01:42:00]  Birds.  Birds.  Birds.  Birds.  Birds.  Birds.  Birds.  Birds.  We'll take a break.  Also, we might play Guess the Sound today.  Oh.  Guess the Sound.  And then Tyra Banks.  Is this Guess the Sound or is it Coming or Going?  Guess the Sound.  Guess the Sound?  Okay.  I get confused.  It's different than Coming or Going.  Yeah.  Coming or Going is the long, drawn-out version of Guess the Sound. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, I have a sound you'll never guess.  What the hell is that?  I don't know.  That's one of our dudes.  What?  Is it?  He's one of the guys you want walking around this joint.  Who is it?  He's one of the guys that's going to help redesign the place.  Oh.  Glad he's here.  Glad he's getting out of here.  I have no idea who that is.  That's Terry Carr.  We've met with the guy a bunch of times.  I've never met him.  You've met Terry Carr.  I don't think I care.  I walked in here today, saw boxes full.  I see empty cubicles.  Cubicles still here, but they're emptying out boxes. 
[01:43:00]  It's moving day soon.  Get out.  No, these guys were supposed to report to the new facility today.  Really?  So you're not going to see many faces around?  We shan't see them?  Not really.  And now what?  The movers come in, grab the boxes, ship them over.  And then they can start getting rid of the cubicles.  And we can finally build our lounge and stage and all that.  I'm going to miss them.  I'm hearing next.  You know, you don't really appreciate something until it's gone.  I will say, though, the guy, the Oompa Loompa we had the trouble with 
[01:43:30]  from the very beginning of the show, Buddy, I wound up liking him very much.  Turned out to be one of the best guys.  He really was.  You know, as far as people that aren't involved directly with our program.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's not a bad guy.  Not at all.  And I had the Broadway.  Who's the guy?  The big tall guy?

Yeah, that's a little...  Hey, too bad Cheney didn't fall on him and crush his teeth. 
[01:44:30]  It would have been lawyer takes dick in the face.  You fucking fact-changing dickhead.  Hunting...  If they were hunting rooster...  Yeah.  ...and as Dick Cheney shot him, the guy fell down, opened his mouth, and fell on the rooster  face first, it could have been Dick Cheney shoots man with cock and mouth.  Or, too bad, Dick Cheney didn't rush and try to help him and then fall into a donkey.  It would have been dick in ass.  Oh, you creep. 
[01:45:00]  It's not fucking...  Too bad it couldn't have been...  Yeah, well, it wasn't.  If only his last name was cunt.  Because...  Too bad Dick didn't fall into a cat, because then it would have been dick in pussy.  Bah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Ugh.  Hope you hit a guardrail.

[01:56:30]  is it ob is this like when parents let their kids run crazy around because they know come on make them  go to sleep earlier i think uh the listeners need a timeout they need a nappy you know where that joke  would work how about an arrest area tell your trucker buddy while he's shitting in the next stall  and you two can have a nice laugh while you smell each other's dumps tell it through him to him through  the little hole and exactly while you're peeking and you're looking at his one eye which has white 
[01:57:00]  stuff shooting out that's right stupid it's a caterpillar spitting a cocoon right in your face  they're just about done i think though verne in texas they're wearing out verne okay lawyer gets  facial courtesy of dick can you not sound like you're smoking a joint while you deliver that  awful joke phone lines are horrible i think they're dead are we done i think they're done that's it  done right wow we cleaned it out all right they're tired they're gonna go take a nap now uh this is what 
[01:57:30]  we really wanted to do here jim norton's ex left a voicemail yes she did is this a crazy woman no no  she's perfectly sane the one i went and saw king kong with on christmas and was texting the entire  time in her purse oh she's out of her mind i love this girl she's the one that was in here when could  she come back in she's crazy soon she wants to come back well who was she text messaging during king  kong who knows do you know me me me me she's like i'm doing it my purse i'm like i know i'm here 
[01:58:00]  she doesn't have a big attention span does she um she's no worse like a  fucking gnat on methamphetamines yeah  so what's this voicemail about it just this is what i have to deal with when i'm coming back from  la this is just she left she had a little concern about something this is real right oh yeah  all right listen to this voicemail hey muffin um i have a sexual health question 
[01:58:30]  and you're the only person i know that i could possibly ask this to um i'm slightly concerned  i slept with a prostitute um a female prostitute without protection obviously because i'm a girl but  if i was a guy i'm sure she would have used protection and i just have a few um  um sort of side effects i'm just wondering what the ramifications are and what can happen 
[01:59:00]  um like i would guess these girls are probably cleaner than most because they use condoms on  most guys but i wonder how many girls they sleep with and she had no problem like making out with me  and doing everything with me that any protection and now i'm getting worried um symptoms maybe it's  nothing but i don't know i figured if anyone knows about hookers it's you and i wanted to do it just  because i've never done it before i mean who can hit 30 and never slept with a prostitute before it's 
[01:59:30]  just not natural call me back bye oh yeah that's just not natural that's just not natural on venus  wherever the fuck planet you're from that chick is such a lunatic she is truly not yet wait she turned  30 and decides she needed to sleep with a prostitute oh no no she's actually not but she was i was just  maybe she's thinking of 30 i don't know where 30 came from no she's probably like saying she doesn't  want to get to 30 without having done it so she probably like would do it now we've traded messages 
[02:00:00]  back we haven't spoken yet we've tracked her called her back and then she called me back has she talked  about what weird side effects are no because she's a hypochondriac are they shankers it probably was  nothing a rash i don't know i haven't spoken to her itching hmm pain can we get her on the  swelling of the vulva yeah we gotta get her on the show is she up right now um i don't know i'm sure  she hasn't gone to bed yet i would love to know what her symptoms are um yeah i would like burning 
[02:00:30]  when she urinates i'll give ben her number i have to go to the office that seems very unusual though  that a girl would pick up a a female prostitute i know it is very odd i think that's the first time  i've ever heard that yeah it's not common most people don't do it and she has she's a good looking  girl she doesn't need to do it she can go to a strip club and meet a chick she probably just wanted  to do it it's all like the strip club is a fucking debutante ball no but i mean she could go to the  you know she doesn't need to pick up a prostitute she could go to the likes of a strip club and get 
[02:01:00]  a wonderful uh woman there you went up one step no i mean the strippers are hot maybe oh no the  strippers are they're hard to get now you can't hook up i need my phone it's in my jacket the strippers are  hot yeah for money you can and especially if you're a girl that's an easy fucking gig no no that's  what i'm saying seem like a trick to a girl well girl wouldn't have to probably pay for it i'm not  saying you wouldn't oh you're saying like just to go out hang out and meet a stripper chick go out  too much work she probably just wanted to get her box licked or something yeah but she's told me 
[02:01:30]  some good stories about strip clubs things that have happened yeah oh well we'll see what happens  with that story we're gonna try to call her today eric in new york what's up good morning boys  good morning eric anthony i wanted to ask you something all right if if the losers tuck their  cock between their legs wouldn't they be more aerodynamic well i don't know it could be that  they're using their cock as an airfoil the bigger the bulge the uh air has to move over the top of the 
[02:02:00]  dick um at a different speed than it's going under the bottom of the sled what is that trap the air  bernoulli's uh law well it's uh the the guy uh that invented the airfoil and and when that happens  it creates a lower pressure on the top than the bottom and then i guess it would make less weight  on the runners less friction more speed so the bigger the cock the faster the luge run forget 
[02:02:30]  aristotle and fox secretive here comes professor anthony no eric i i have to first ask him how do you  know that uh like wow hbo real sex forget aristotle and fox socrates possibly here comes professor anthony 
[02:03:00]  we gotta get a luge expert on the phone because i bet you the cock has something to do with how fast  they end up going because it's all about air dynamics right if you're losing by 100th of a  second your cock has some input on what is going on during that run run that means you have a big  cock whether it's big and it's slowing you down or it's big and it's helping you out i'm not quite sure  there could be a wind resistance factor with a big cock there could be some kind of aerodynamic 
[02:03:30]  factor with a big cock uh i'd have to take that big cock into a wind tunnel imagine ben on a luge  oh forget about it the sled stops halfway down just the runners just go into the ice  just we've never seen this before his nickname is the white severed leg  i don't get the luge you could stand back and even though the luge is in a trough 
[02:04:00]  see his cock on top of it and they say that there's snow flying all over and they realize  his pocket opened  just screaming the whole way down  what this is unorthodox this uh never seen a cock like this luge style  perkian and jerky and the luge is going all over the place  takes an hour and 40 to get down  gets pulled over for drunk losing halfway down 
[02:04:30]  just talking in non sequiturs how did you feel going down the hill  hey it's vance you got your ex on 10 there jimmy oh wow okay good  hola hola hi erin how you doing good uh what a weird wait from call oh you're just waking up 
[02:05:00]  it's like nine o'clock in the morning yes it is well most people are at work by now the people  got up uh at nine a.m yeah it is ridiculous but billions of people do it erin um two countries  just heard your voicemail that you left for jim norton which one that you picked up a prostitute  i didn't pick up a prostitute what'd you do the high class girl i ordered her in oh like a call  girl a call girl how much um she was like eight uh eight fifty nine hundred dollars oh my god 
[02:05:30]  oh my god and i i had never done it before it was something i wanted to try one i never spent that  much do you pick cash or credit card cash there's a cash discount it turns out oh yeah so she she uh  you did you describe the type of girl you wanted we actually called um like two or three different  places and ordered three different girls and sent two of them away so uh you had a variety come up to 
[02:06:00]  the door just to be sure and uh two of them were completely unacceptable uh penises no just like  ugly and you know to be charging eight hundred dollars yeah you wanted something uh pretty  yeah so what'd you say when they got to the door how'd you send i never sent one away either how'd you  do that um i didn't do it i just scurried into the other room i gave the thumbs down sign and i let 
[02:06:30]  my friends do it ah so you weren't alone no  interesting was it a threesome yeah oh oh it's a threesome we're thinking that you like just  one day decided on your own to you know it was my idea no but i didn't do why you just uh wanted to  do that it's just like it's the one thing i haven't done yet so it was a guy you and this uh call girl 
[02:07:00]  yes all right so now the the one that you picked comes to the door and uh she's attractive you like  her she was okay she wasn't what i expected a lot more for for eight hundred dollars a little  weathered was she what was the big problem with her yeah um i would describe her as just cute  just cute i expected tall blonde russian you know i expected one of those natasha type 
[02:07:30]  prostitutes and she she was just cute all right so how long did she stay she stayed the full hour  and you could tell she was kind of like on the clock and you know not really add into it you know  i guess you're paying her did she spend did she spend more time with uh you or the guy  um probably me probably you so just a lot of eating box and stuff yeah it was sort of like me first 
[02:08:00]  then him how was she at it she was really good at it technically but you know i could tell she was  in it for the money and that ended up bothering me you mean she here's what she's saying is some of  these girls come over and they're really good actresses and they you know it's a money deal  but they can convince you no no no but i'm saying in general you they convince you that they're into  it and it makes the experience good and then there are other ones that are technically they know what 
[02:08:30]  they're doing yeah but you it's just there's something about their vibe that you just can't  connect with and you know they're not connecting at all and it's like they're just on the job yeah  yeah she was like looking at her watch and then you know after 15 minutes like we'd offered her a drink  and she's like okay let's go into the bedroom and i could just tell she was clocking the time  yeah 800 bucks jesus so now did you uh did you reciprocate with her yeah actually i did all right 
[02:09:00]  what did you do to her scarily and sadly well what can a girl do to another girl well you might  have went for the back door a little bit i don't know you might have oral digital no i didn't go to  the back door you know because she is she don't want to get the ass flu like jimmy got did she seem  clean when you did that very by the way the insider loves your uh your ex-prostitute there oh really  do stories with her on a weekly basis now natalia yeah she's great yeah me you betsy natalia she she 
[02:09:30]  got in a world of uh world of trouble and jimmy yes slept with uh natalia yes and she's now being  featured all over the insider oh what's his name jason what's his name jimmy was insider yeah  yeah so yeah and they had trouble finding an agency because all of those agencies um like american  beauties and julie's all of those agencies were busted because uh jason it really ran everything  hey did let me ask you did she have a nice vag did she have a nice vag uh yeah it didn't look too 
[02:10:00]  beat up or anything beat up i mean everything was clean and copacetic she just wasn't as hot as i  thought she would be for eight hundred dollars all right let's get to was she american or yeah she was  american too which i which i didn't like well how how did the guy turn them down i never what did he  say to them to turn to turn them away we gave two hundred dollars each the ones that we sent away  oh wow um i just sort of like gave a quick thumbs down sign and like scurried like afraid he can't 
[02:10:30]  see the other room and he just said i'm sorry it's not going to work out thank you for your time and  gave him two hundred dollars were they were they snotty or were they okay i don't know i wasn't there  to see it um they uh he said they didn't really react i'm sure it happens a lot you know granted these  curls these were they were atrocious and they're trying to charge eight hundred dollars i'm sure you know  people are not drunk enough that they get turned away on a semi-frequent basis okay so i don't know 
[02:11:00]  quite what the prostitute etiquette is but you know i think you should have a right to send someone away  if she's not what you want oh you do yeah technically you do so uh then after the threesome you had a  little paranoia hit the old brain yeah i actually i you know i freaked out and sort of um you know got a  little hypochondriac and went to the doctor and you know i i just sort of freaked out i was like 
[02:11:30]  what can i get and now what what what what got you going that you thought you had something there  had to be a symptom pop-up what was it what was it there was nothing got me going i just you know i  i just wanted to know from a doctor what i could get from you know a prostitute you didn't have any  bumps any rashes any itching i i had some symptoms that i had made up in my head burning when you 
[02:12:00]  urinate wait what were the symptoms you made up in your head um i convinced myself that i was itching  and burning but i don't think i actually was i just kind of you know as soon as she left the next day i  woke up and just kind of wigged out you're a bit of a hypochondriac a little bit i don't think i  would have wigged out unless i had um reciprocated on her that's what really freaked me out did she  eat your ass at all yes she did really what a trooper he did everything and she would not kiss 
[02:12:30]  the guy nor would she do any um oral without uh conscious or without condoms on with the guy  right she wouldn't kiss him at all no for 800 bucks she wouldn't give a gfe like that  no not at all experience she did everything with me when you kiss the guy now now wait a minute did  did the guy fuck you without a rubber he didn't fuck me at all oh okay because i was going to say  and then she ate the box after that it's all by proxy you know oh but we wouldn't have let him 
[02:13:00]  fuck me with the same rubber no i'm talking about you know taking off the rubber what he's saying was  did the man insert his penis into you without a condom and then the girl went down on you because  technically that's the same thing yeah nothing had pointed out to her in that moment but  um hey um aren't you putting that where for 800 bucks you wouldn't kiss him that's annoying  yeah that really was annoying and that kind of that was one of the things that kind of killed it for 
[02:13:30]  me did she did she say she was did she say no i won't kiss him she said no i don't kiss boys  really well do you take their money you fucking idiot yeah that's exactly what she said you expect  that for a couple hundred bucks for 800 bucks it should be a full you know well everything and i i  expected that if she would eat me out without you know any dental dam or whatever you would use on a  girl that she would blow him without anything and she wouldn't do that either i don't mind that as 
[02:14:00]  much because a lot of them won't it's like all right whatever that's her that's her limit and she's  afraid but not kissing is just an intimacy thing it's like oh stop trying to hold on to something  you're fucking eating pussy for money dangerous disease wise for her to go down on me no thing  absolutely not no what can you get from going down on a guy um i don't know actually i don't i don't  know if you can get aids that way i mean i imagine it's really hard but i'm guessing like i think the  easiest probably the easiest and uh and uh most dangerous thing you could get is like herpes or 
[02:14:30]  chlamydia or something like that i mean i don't know it just i think it's a lot harder from giving  they could cure like chlamydia uh yeah i found her lack of compliance for the price sort of rude and  offensive that's a good way to put it i really i thought there would be you know a little more  effort on her part and she didn't even you know fake it that well so all right you should have called  them and complained a little bit what am i going to say your prostitute was unenthusiastic could you 
[02:15:00]  send me a more enthusiastic cooker please yeah i mean in so many words sure yeah you're spending  good money well let me ask you is there could you tell us off air if there's a picture of her on a  website or something we can look at i'm trying to think i have it in the computer it's one of three  websites oh you know you don't remember which one okay yeah i would have to like like scour the  websites again yeah okay we'll take a look at her but maybe it doesn't say girlfriend experience  it didn't it didn't we we actually picked out another girl who had a picture who was gorgeous 
[02:15:30]  who was a lot more money and then he got and i i was doing all the calling and ordering the girls  and he got on the phone and actually scared the agency off why what did he say because he's an idiot  he just asked too many like idiotic questions i said does she do couples and they said yes  and he's like well well call her and find out that she's really into couples we want someone  that's really into couples and i'm like it's a hooker they're not really into anything they're 
[02:16:00]  really into money wait you didn't have a picture of her before she came over this one no how do they  send out an 800 girl what they're doing there is they're going to call three or four girls and  just see who's available how do you not have a photo i know that's why we ordered the three  different girls you're a pro jimmy any decent agencies online since it's literally busted  to add pictures of girls you could go and find there are some where you could find uh photos you 
[02:16:30]  got to go with a photo you never go without a picture faces were blanked out yeah but the body  you can see i don't care if the face looks like fucking i don't care they look like mick jagger as  long as the body and i don't think they send the real girl i think if you pick out a natasha  they send a girl that's in the category of natasha man not necessarily that's called bait and switch  and they don't always do that a lot of times they'll send you the girl they're supposed to  send like the better agencies will anyone else find this really weird why yeah well just because  it's your ex it's well she's still my favorite there was a time you guys kind of had a love thing  going and now it's just you two are friends just talking about prostitutes no i know it's just weird 
[02:17:00]  to me that's all it's look at how many hookers he told me about three no i listen to your show  oh i i know that little jimmy was jimmy getting hookers when he was dating you um i would guess  that he probably was of course he denies it no i really wasn't i would guess that tony who's a  compulsive with prostitutes probably was getting a little something on the side but i have no proof  i was not what was i would tell you now what was the real problem with your relationship i know you 
[02:17:30]  said jimmy worked too hard and never made time for you but what else um actually the night we broke  up he was supposed to come pick me up at like seven o'clock and he was with you all day till like  two in the morning and he and he used to do stuff like where were we i don't remember he might be  maybe the cellar maybe the cellar and quail hunting what maybe you're using me so you could  go bang a hooker no i remember the argument i remember i was on the west side highway driving 
[02:18:00]  i think we were fighting and no i actually was with you yeah opie was frequently the excuse  frequently oh man you were used yeah opie i was glad you guys actually spend together  he was uh he was using me to bang hookers no i was jimmy's excuse i mean it was  it was he was with opie till two in the morning it was a business dinner and this was like a  consistent thing business oh you guys god yeah i was sitting there waiting they called me at two 
[02:18:30]  and at this point i had a job and i could get up at like seven eight in the morning and he's like  oh i'll just come over and help and i'm like two in the morning i have to get up you know in a few  hours and fuck you no you won't and that was just sort of the last straw but that that was basically it  that never once i hadn't been to one movie with him there was never a night that didn't involve  being at at the cellar we never went so he never really went on real dates for the most part yeah  i was with him on september 11th on september 11th he called every comedy club in the tri-state area 
[02:19:00]  to see if there was one club that he could perform at he couldn't deal with not going on stage for  one night yeah he's obsessed i actually went on i think it was september 12th i finally got to go  on to the 13th in a youth hostel in harlem they were doing a show you were that obsessed back  then yeah yes you've calmed down a little bit yeah and it wasn't jimmy loves being on a stage but  it was an obsession for a while yeah you gotta admit oh yeah for for years not for you it cost me  every relationship i've had in the last 10 years oh i can imagine all right very good friend

[02:31:00]  it is a massive massive thing for xm yes and finally one more as you all probably know gail's  my best friend and um she and i have talked every night of our lives for as long as we've been friends  and so i had this idea to do reality radio so we record our phone conversation  so we're going to record our phone conversations and um and play them on the radio as a radio show 
[02:31:30]  isn't that a bit steal bit steal about it is we've been kind of thinking about it uh as we're talking  now we're ripping us off i mean we're taking that yes from her well you can't have that boy if this  they were recording this you're gonna have that on the radio so tune in and you'll hear beep  because i hear one side of it and it's it is entertaining  that will be the oprah and gail reality radio show on xm coming this september it ought to be a hoot 
[02:32:00]  i um we ought to do the same thing with our thing we're stealing that bitch from oprah  yeah too bad we're on first believe me we won't have a crossover audience  yeah let's record some of our phone conversations could we all talk every night guys  no but i'll be we do oh i got some ideas  and then uh good old leno a lot of exposure for xm in the last few days  do you hear this uh and our friend oprah signed a three-year 55 million dollar deal with xm satellite 
[02:32:30]  radio they're the big one you know the big one the other one's kind of small it's the big one xm  satellite radio oprah's gonna be on satellite so finally she's free of the fcc and she can swear  and be as raunchy as she wants nicely threw in that little extra jab oh that little jab that's  the big one the other one's not so big not so big that was kind of big yeah we love leno that was  exactly what that was about of course it was yeah howard's doing just such crazy great stuff over 
[02:33:00]  there no one cares anymore and then our old buddy uh scuff rel uh old buddy huh old buddy  yeah yeah because sometimes you go hey my old buddy jim and jim's still my buddy yes this is the ex  buddy pharrell i think i called him a bloody cunt clot but how did you mean it i meant it in a way 
[02:33:30]  uh that is worse than it sounds what what a phony lump of shit this guy is well just some just a phony  just some back history we worked with scott farrell at uh wnew in new york anthony and i uh actually got  him hired at wnew he's a guy that's uh he's very good can't keep his fucking job you know something  he's good to some people some people like him some people hate him i for one bit my tongue a lot of 
[02:34:00]  times just let him you know just because you talk fast doesn't mean it's fucking good if you're into  sports fine you find him entertaining great whatever i was never i swear to you there were  times i bit my lip here and just like all right let him go he's just on a rambling ramp won't let  anyone get a fucking word in edgewise he's on 20 different subjects none of them entertaining or funny  and uh you know he was very hit or miss uh but out of friendship and loyalty i wasn't gonna blow up 
[02:34:30]  the guy's spot or anything like that let him go some people seem to enjoy him that's fine  the second and we uh just some back history too we are very interested in getting him here at xm  very interested we had a we had a list of people we were very interested in getting here at xm but  uh we had to put all that on hold remember the whole golden ticket thing that was a thing that  was happening and then there's uh some things that happened behind the scenes so we had to kind of  just stop that put it on hold for a while but eventually we are gonna you know hire some of our 
[02:35:00]  friends and we were all friends it wasn't just like a radio thing we were all got along really well  and he knew that yeah friends and he was told that and uh and we're like all right you know but hang in  there you know whatever and then next thing you know there's a post on uh his website that he's  now claiming he didn't write or something oh now he's claiming he did oh now he well great i have an  email that uh from that's because he wrote me personally because he was all scared that the pests  were getting to him and his family and uh he goes look i had nothing to do with the post on the website 
[02:35:30]  and we're like come on scott at least admit it and this post on the website was basically saying how  great you know howard was and uh how he's gonna kick our ass he's gonna kick ona's ass and it's like  wait a minute you're a friend of ours why would you out of nowhere just you know start uh you know  have a post like that on your website and here's the thing if if he wasn't getting hired by xm quickly  enough or you know i don't know all the details of the talks that went on between him and xm if things  didn't work out and he got a better deal at sirius i have no problem don't make the mistake of 
[02:36:00]  thinking that anyone that goes to sirius is an asshole and uh you know fuck them if uh the guy's got  to eat and wants to have a job and they're offering him a better job take it i don't care uh jim brewer's  been over there from from the start before we were even here and that was a huge disappointment  because we're we really like the guy we would have loved to have had a great radio with the guy we  would have loved to have him here but he's over there uh bottom line when we did that comedy tour 
[02:36:30]  and he was there i i sat in a dressing room with brewer we pass on a i have no problem with jim  brewer i find him funny i like jim brewer i see him on the street i there's no like mother fuck this  avoiding anybody he's great you know why he does what he does we do what we do we like each other  there's no reason to bash jim brewer bad blood we love no bad blood fine he works over there we work  over here uh that's how it worked out we would have liked it different didn't work out that way  it worked out this way i have no problem with that the problem is fucking pharrell before he even 
[02:37:00]  uh announced any gig that was going on over there took the first opportunity he could to bash ona on  his website and start what everyone over there seems to have to do lap howard's fucking nutsack  to uh snuggle up and try to keep or get a gig over there and now all pharrell is doing he did a show  i guess thursday and friday over there is lapping howard's ass every i swear to you it has to be every 
[02:37:30]  five minutes he brings up the fact that oh this fantastic howard stern man he's got just got the  innovator it's so exciting to be over here with howard it's nothing but kissing ass on howard  uh he bashes us in the pests and uh and worse of all they have him saddled with a hole they gave  him they you and you know they sat him down and said this guy needs to be calmed down he just babbles 
[02:38:00]  incessantly about shit let's get him a hole and oh god oh dear broad to sit there and uh undermine  what he did that some people did like uh just a waste and and you know something pharrell you can  go fuck yourself no one on the show bad with that i'm not going to ever sit with him again like we did  with our agent and talk and have him talk about how great we are and and uh uh just bullshit up and 
[02:38:30]  down because uh the bottom line is this guy doesn't care about anybody but pharrell and that's fine you go  through life like that but you've exposed yourself he doesn't care about howard either i'm not delusional  and think that he thinks howard's great he still thinks howard's a fucking asshole but he's a phony  he's going to make that a phony uh response and he thinks we're assholes he thinks everyone's an  asshole except pharrell who by the way everyone in the business thinks is a fucking asshole because the 
[02:39:00]  guy can't hold a fucking job and he's pissed off that our pest went after him after he posted what he  did on his website yeah and we're like look pharrell you wrote this thing why would you write this if  you're claiming to be our friends oh and then somebody tried to get on a message board and said  uh pharrell didn't write it that pharrell was sick and that uh some other guy wrote it it was written  by pharrell you can't mistake that that's it was written in his fucking words and the way he speaks  stop it who's that hot chick in the picture with me as co-host she's really hot i'm sure she's a 
[02:39:30]  she's a fan of our show it's lynn hoffman she came here and took pictures with all of us well  now she's a whole she was meeting us congratulations congratulations now you're a whole he's going to  kiss her but she's putting her hand up like stop he's got the wacky pharrell face on you made a great  point in the office how stupid radio is by the way yeah like your friends i i have the quote where i said  your friends become your enemies and your enemies become your friends it's just how it is in radio and i  i hate that i've gotten sucked into it because there's only two occupations careers whatever 
[02:40:00]  businesses that this shit happens in it's radio and fucking professional wrestling that it's great  to be lumped into that no other job does that no other fucking job you don't go to you don't go to  any other job and have the smack talk that goes down in in radio and where where one day uh you walk  into a studio and a guy is your friend and in front of the audience uh you're talking he picks up a 
[02:40:30]  chair and slams it into your face oh my god he just hit him with a chair i can't believe it just  yesterday he were friends and now they're the deadliest of enemies only radio and fucking wrestling  great great company they all do it when they go over to the little doggy company bubble love sponge  is uh an article that came out on him on one of the radio sites basically saying his dream station  would be you know uh howard stern himself and opian anthony yeah and now we're hacks that would be 
[02:41:00]  yeah now you know because now it's all bad now it's all bad because we're not uh on the on the  same um uh channel and you can go over there and not have to kiss so much howard ass i don't get that  there's no self-respect in it no one bashed pharrell here and it's not going to get you anywhere i don't  think they understand over there that i think they get caught up in the howard hype where they're  going over there sirius has pumped howard up so much that they think that by going over there 
[02:41:30]  they're part of that big howard picture no one's talking about you pharrell is not fucking bringing  subscribers to sirius sorry we have to everybody's chagrin over there and uh people that don't like  the opian anthony show we have done uh huge things here at xm with getting subscribers keeping an  audience getting new people to sign up getting people that have signed up to listen to this program 
[02:42:00]  tell their friends who then sign up this is fact this is what happened there's a buzz about this show  in the satellite world and uh that is spreading if you're working over there and you're lapping  howard's ass and howard has less than us to begin with right there's another thing the excitement is  not about howard and you it's about howard leaving radio you are now an employee over there at the  second best out of two satellite companies congratulations that's it and to hear pharrell 
[02:42:30]  because i i was listening on pal they do this thing on pal talk it's fantastic uh they all get on  they pick a war room uh and then broadcast the audio from the show so now instead of the old days  which was like a couple of months ago where they had to get a message board together and pretty much  um just it was very hard to get the audio of the show streaming to everybody how to do it individually 
[02:43:00]  now they could do it in one place they plan everything they uh get the phone numbers up there  on the uh pal talk thing and then pound them and pound them and pharrell was getting pounded by the  pest i never heard the ramon call yes you suck not you dude it was so funny and he was getting so  pissed he had to keep he was trying to dump out and he would run out of dump and have to go to  commercial serious yeah he was dumping out oh yeah yeah dumping and serious dumping out of the 
[02:43:30]  because i'm serious motherfucking pussy wouldn't put our callers on the air they're uncensored  that you can battle them they have a real censorship issue over there at the little doggy company is  it because there's no xl uh whatever no xl reasons they don't want to promote opium anthony  there's no there's reason oh god there's reason we've been hearing some things really  how are beyond pissed off because they're already censoring them from a you know from uh the top yep  there you go there you go let's say hi to jeff in pennsylvania fucko list jeff i was listening to it 
[02:44:00]  on friday we got xm and serious and uh they were just fucking going crazy on him and he like you  said he was dumping and that that fool couldn't talk and she couldn't say anything and somebody  called up one time and was playing emily's my vagina and he was completely thrown on the fucking  floor the guy's a goofball and you're right he can't keep a common thought it's just fucking horrible  no dude he was going off on so many i and to tell you the truth out of all the time that we have 
[02:44:30]  known the guy i only heard him on our show i couldn't listen to his show i don't like his show  but i understood that some people uh did like him fine uh i couldn't stomach him that much when he would  go off and just start rambling you try to ask him a question or steer him in a direction about a sports  story that was going on and he's off and like you you want to have a discussion with the guy and  it's impossible so they put this hole with him and she tries to steer him it doesn't work it is nothing 
[02:45:00]  but this disjointed babble that you can't get a hold of for long enough to to enjoy anything is she  good though does she have some funny things i couldn't tell i couldn't even tell if she was just  your standard hole or she could be the best fucking thing in radio with him just  shut up ramon calls coming in oh yeah you sir not you yeah take this man with throat cancer off the 
[02:45:30]  air i mean just horrendous boston strangler what's up hey good morning boys i want to let everybody  know that the attack is still on for tonight oh it ain't stopping oh no definitely not we're going  to be back in the the uh pal talk war room at 8 p.m when the show goes on and we're going to  fucking destroy him i don't you know he didn't have to go over there and trash us nope we didn't do  anything if he went over there something on his website so we we called him out on it like what's 
[02:46:00]  that about and we even said call our show so we can work this out because then he wrote a few people  say look i didn't write it so i'm like all right call the show let's talk it out you know but i  think the pest at this point they could smell a phony he didn't have to do that now he's gonna have  to pay for it and now we're the assholes look around over there because we couldn't uh work out  a deal that's fine that's fine it's fine we would be bummed but but to go over there and the first  chance you get is trash us what's that about well dude in one breath he was praising you guys and then 
[02:46:30]  the next breath he was going you know fuck opian anthony he was making references to your uh  agents because he's a lunatic i know he's a fucking lunatic and then uh at another point he kept on  going on and saying basically how uh you guys abandoned him and uh here you guys are on a beach  drinking making money while he's starving to death yeah while everyone else uh got fired over there  yeah because that was our motive yeah we weren't trying to get another fucking job somewhere the 
[02:47:00]  next day that infinity locked us into our contract and fired everybody else that's our fault because  we went up to mel karmazin's office and said mel could you keep paying us so we can't fucking work  but fire all the people that have been loyal and uh we appreciated having working for us uh for three  or five you or whatever the fuck years it was that's what happened yeah we told mel karmazin what the  fuck to do what a deranged fucking drunk idiot that cocksucker is fuck pharrell fuck pharrell 
[02:47:30]  well anyway i just want to put out an apb an all pest bulletin to come into the pal talk rooms  tonight around eight o'clock the number for stern show or pharrell show is 1-888 stern 100 we're gonna  freaking destroy him like we did last time we got a like if he's brave enough to have fun have fun  taking calls pharrell hey how do uh people get uh get on this pal talk by the way because there's a 
[02:48:00]  lot of people email and say look i want to be part of the pal talk yeah well in order to keep the enemy  element out it's kind of a thing you got to go through i see okay but but if go on a pal talk get in a  room see what you can work out all right that's all they can really say all right you guys and it's  very entertaining to listen do we have any uh audio of that or do we have any yeah we got scuff  pharrell on howard this this guy was our friend i mean i mean it's so ridiculous to say anyone's 
[02:48:30]  your friend in radio it really is but i did a show when we were off tim sabie and i were talking back  and forth on a weekly basis from the day i got fired all the way up until he took a job at the  little doggy company and out of nowhere he just fucking goes to work with howard he hates howard  yeah but tim said how great we were he had fucking posters in his office down at ysp even after we  got fired the guy fucking loves us and turns around and goes to work with howard but i have no problem 
[02:49:00]  with tim sabian either not at all i really can't i have a big fucking problem dude he might like mel  maybe he likes working and i was closest to tim than all you guys he's a fucking phony just like  the rest of them maybe xm didn't want for the money it's it's sad to say that but i'm calling  him out he's a fucking phony like the rest of them because there was a reason why he wasn't ready  to leave his uh past job and come over to xm there was a stock thing and there were other uh concerns  that he wanted to wait out and then also out of nowhere he'd like he pulls the trigger and goes to  work for uh howard i don't know what deals are made by these guys so i can't just so just for the 
[02:49:30]  fact of going over there i don't have enough information i don't know what well if xm said  hey tim uh here's a hundred thousand dollars a year uh we want you to sign a fucking 10-year  contract come on over and sirius goes hey tim here's a million uh five a year uh here's uh  umpteen thousand fucking shares of stock here's uh the power position you're gonna have and you're  back under mel who loves you uh you know you can't fault the guy the the weight of o and a loyalty 
[02:50:00]  to that has to balance out something i got no problem with him just he didn't bad mouth so  personally for me you guys don't know the inside scoop and he's not bad about the money it wasn't  about the money i'm telling you maybe he just wasn't about the fucking money maybe he loves no  i mean i don't know but it's not a love for howard or a dislike for what i love that it's these guys  on radio they're a bunch of fucking phonies they love you but then they turn around and and you know 
[02:50:30]  kick you in the balls when you're not looking well i'm telling you man and then i you know i was  really close with the guy and i find out from a stupid radio message board that he got hired over  there didn't even have the balls to call up and go look dude this is what's going on  he probably would have been in big trouble if he called the opie and anthony show  on xm to announce that he was not our actual show behind the scenes i slept in the fucking guy's  house i'm telling you go through his drawers big condoms xls no that was he got in there was 
[02:51:00]  somebody else uh swamp knob and today good name anthony you there yes my friend i am here until 1101  anthony listen the other night i don't know if you got on in time one of the callers called up his uh  howard's daughter emily and got in singing the whole my vagina song and the stupid douchebag pharrell  didn't even catch on to it and let it go for a minute and say nah that's great i don't know what 
[02:51:30]  this guy's talking about he just sat there laughing his butt i don't know what it is i don't know what  it was great i was in tears the whole the whole board and uh uh bow talk was in tears over it well  if you guys get audio that please send it in we love that shit thank you hey how about hey yeah did  you catch a lil on cam the other night she was out of her mind she's a classic lil on cam oh she was  crazy naughty girl the other night yeah she's a dirty oh she's a filthy lovely individual thanks  let's go to rose in west virginia rose hey it's me hey i did the my vagina call i'm calling in to

[02:52:30]  don't you tell us how you really feel about for a don't hold back listen this guy is such a fucking  asshole when he was on your show you guys talk sports you know when you train a guy in sports they  stay friends with each other just because they go from dallas to pittsburgh or whatever they stay  pals why does this guy gotta out himself and be a fucking dick it's bizarre i think i think he feels  like he has to like kiss howard's ass to work over there like anthony brought up because it's really  bizarre that he would just go after us like that we're at the point now where if somebody bashes us 
[02:53:00]  they feel like they're getting in a little better with howard and uh that isn't the case you're being  bamboozled well and these guys uh have no idea they're making a huge mistake because they're not  working for the howard stern of 1995 ish no it's a whole new world man he's not a boss he's overpaid  when we were off the air i did his show i think it was atlanta and he was great i mean he was asking 
[02:53:30]  for you guys he was he was happy we got audio of him kissing our ass it was uh we don't have to go  any further than this machine right here to find audio of him kissing our ass well i would like to  hear it if fucking hawk was on duty instead of eating his fucking awful sandwich there and traipsing  off to engage in homosexual what is he eating what is in that it's just awful what is it oh shit oh it's  in the car put it back up there put it back up there now hey jimmy i spoke to your mom at your hbo  show eric your thing fell over what was that it's on my seat now your sandwich fell eric what was in 
[02:54:00]  that eric tuna it's all over the floor hey jim yeah you did you fucking stomped it like the gestapo  what i saw you doing the hbo show and after the show i talked to your mom and dad okay and i told  her that it was funny the way you know you guys played that message from your machine and she was  like oh my god i was mortified i had no idea when i left that message she was gonna bring it in  she was so cute i just wanted to say she was all right oh thank you all right um thanks i gotta 
[02:54:30]  apologize i'm sorry eric it seemed right at the time and now it seems right now i don't apologize  you're the boss and now i feel bad there's tuna in the treads of my not only should you have done  that you should have done it while it was in his hand and he was eating it while it was in his mouth  that's how you assert power i thought i thought it was kind of fun first of all he's still hungry 
[02:55:00]  and the rest of that sandwich was like oh why don't you buy him a new sandwich hope i'm really  sorry yeah get him a new sandwich no i gotta start apologizing to things get him a new sandwich i  thought it'd be fun and then get him a new sandwich then i looked at him and the sandwich is squashed  all over the floor it's a little sad you yell at him like he's connie now clean it up  didn't didn't get the reaction i wanted it's just i feel really awkward right now why he's all right  sometimes you do outrageous things it gets the laugh you were looking for and other times you  just feel like i dope otherwise she will just go oh he just did that why don't you buy him a new one 
[02:55:30]  what you've been uh let's see a little more all right well here's some audio of uh pharrell kissing  howard's ass i guess it's hard to listen to because he used to be our friend yeah whatever  whatever the whatever a friend is supposed to be on in radio more doesn't mean shit this is scott  pharrell he did a radio show for us here on howard 100 last night are you you're on tonight right scott  absolutely it's just the greatest thing ever for me great is this not oh my god it was just the 
[02:56:00]  sickest night of my life i've now accomplished everything in life i did letterman twice and now  i sit with you god on earth my uh hero in radio thank you when you were at any w it was it was  rumored that you were fired for because you told management to fuck off yes i did you walked in  okay all right yeah here we go you know why he got fired yep it just hit me yeah remember he was  sticking up for us right because of the sex for sam thing that anthony and i blew up our careers over 
[02:56:30]  yeah scott pharrell was uh the guy that won one went on the air and basically basically said this  is bullshit blah blah blah they had told uh the air staff not to mention us not to talk about us  anymore we were done holy shit they're actually talking about this on howard's show yeah the reason  he got fired was fucking sticking up for us and scott went on and uh said it was bullshit that we got  fired and they fired him oh wow that's the echo that's kind of creepy when you hear yourself 
[02:57:00]  screaming jeez it's like who's that lunatic out there oh it's me are you kidding me yeah yeah  he went down this road with howard and what what do they mention us i don't know i didn't hear this  any w it was it was rumored that you were fired for because you told management to fuck off yes i  did you walked into an office and said fuck off now some of those bosses are here today and i love  them very much and they're great to me and they've always been good to me jeremy coleman i look up to  great great it all stemmed from the only thing look we all got you look up to him scott he's three

[02:58:00]  he was lupus right yeah great to me they've always been good to me jeremy coleman i look up to  great guy great it all stemmed from the ona thing look we all got fired 30 of us went down the drain  instantaneously in a matter of three days i got nothing out of it i got you know no cause you're  the devil see you later good luck to you have fun in boca your pad and stay the f away from us you  miserable and so i was gone i went one day they did the thing in the church and the next day i'm in bed

[02:59:00]  your shit buddy for how real he wants to come off he's nothing but a people are going to see  through your shit buddy did you say bad stuff about you you didn't have to you didn't have to  go down this road you just go over there do your gig do your gig it's great the shows have been  kick-ass i drive around like a homeless person listening every day i don't usually get off on  any shows on radio i hate everyone uh but i'm friends with a lot of people in the business that do  shows i don't think much of any of them but as friends i do and i think what you're doing and 
[02:59:30]  always in my life it's been a kicker for me and laughing this guy makes me laugh like i no one  makes me laugh well one of those things you're a sick fucker you make me laugh one of the nice  things about this job now is i do get to meet other radio people and i get to uh hang out they're  all jealous of you well but i also get to maybe even uh i worked with everyone that hates you i know  everyone in the industry everyone in the industry they all hate you but if you're working you're  great guys when you inspire people and you give them an opening and you you say to something radio 
[03:00:00]  can be better and you pioneer shows are better than all of theirs that's the problem they get  all flustered and then you know i just like to be around great talent like being on that show and  being on with uh greg and anthony all the time was great for me and their audience and being on  today is another experience i'll never forget see he can't totally commit though right yeah not during  that portion but uh then when he got on his regular show oh yeah he really started going off  scott you didn't have to go down that road i feel sorry for you we're just jealous holy shit what it 
[03:00:30]  is it's amazing it's amazing well we got a picture of the uh the box that's filled with all the old  milk oh and it's labeled books and it's gonna go to the new facility with all the other boxes around  here that is gonna stink man holy shit we might get in trouble for that that's a good one i gotta  tell you oh come on it's a fret prank let's go to chris in boston chris what's up hey uh i want to 
[03:01:00]  tell a little jimmy he started talking about how he did uh that fucker show he said something along  the lines of uh that hat comic that ona bring on and try to have him tell jokes was on my show and i  couldn't laugh at him if i had a cocktail an hour or some stupid shit like that yeah that the whole  say that the just it just shows desperation it's the whole thing with you know no one makes me laugh  i'm friends with radio people but they don't make me laugh i don't think of much what they do 
[03:01:30]  but you you you go you're crazy you're all that right there is just why do you have to go that far  this guy just lied by the way his genius dig at him was that he should get a haircut  or something like that are you trying not to burn a bridge jimmy not at all he said that i'll  fucking i'd love to attack him for that if he said i don't believe that i'm just not gonna let  somebody fuck he did say that okay well then fuck him derrick is now saying he said it call derrick a  liar jimmy why i believe i believe derrick a liar no derrick's too handsome let's go to uh pharrell

[03:02:30]  but anyway i appreciate his support yes i didn't appreciate his humor exactly support uh support yes  humor shoot yourself your support was very good very good but the joke itself was ghastly it's just  embarrassing that these guys gotta go on howard's show and kiss his ass like that all of them have  to come in and kiss the ring that's what's embarrassing they were all fighting the good  fight and just didn't have what it takes to to get it done so like all right well i might as well join 
[03:03:00]  him kiss his ass do what he tells me to do yeah in some in some strange twist of of reality if this  ever happened uh we for some reason had to go over there had to go over to sirius no they would have  to build a the berlin wall yeah there would have to be a wall there would net you would not hear us 
[03:03:30]  doing this no there will be no ona kissing ass like that it just wouldn't fucking happen  it couldn't happen why do these guys feel like that will put them in the big picture of of howard's  career it it's just because you kiss his ass doesn't mean you're going to be written up in the  fucking blurb about him christ all right so there you go let's go to hell's dignity hell's dignity what's 
[03:04:00]  up i can't fucking believe this guy he was just on inviting you guys to ball games dude he was like  when are you coming up to play golf oh we went across the street and we had uh like golf like  that kennedy kid played it with that girl that motherfucker went across the street for lunch  with our agent trying to figure the whole fucking thing out the last we talked to scott we're like  look scott it ain't gonna happen right now but we were trying to get him a spot on our show at least 
[03:04:30]  to keep it going and then uh you know elo's got to figure out some things behind the scenes and then  something something big is going to happen for other shows well it's time for the fucko list we  i'm telling you right now i did nothing anthony did nothing jimmy did nothing personally nothing to  this nothing nothing you know all we know is one of our past go you better check out the pharrell uh  website because he's trashing you guys like what that's impossible and then he uh wrote me a long  email on my aol account i'll have to bring that in you should where he's uh you know 
[03:05:00]  actually saying how great we are on in the email and he was a little scared because the pests were  trashing him and his kid and his wife and all that let me tell you and then he was threatening  lawsuits and i'm like what are you talking about i i've gotten emails and still get emails from  every jock that's been fired since we've got fired i have them and it's all very nice very uh 
[03:05:30]  uh a lot of camaraderie there because uh people can relate what it's like to get fired when you're  you got a radio gig and it's so like it's so different because you know you're very cordial  to each other back and forth talking regardless of who it is and then it just snaps and then fuck you  fuck this it's worse than fucking wash women this gig fucking radio what a bunch of assholes i just 
[03:06:00]  never thought that he was like a fraudulent bootlicker i really never thought that about  the guy i'm like i thought he was at least an honest guy comes off with having more balls than  that i guess and more uh independence dignity whatever you want to fucking call it but then  there he is just like bullshitting to howard just like we were bullshitted to by him yeah what's the  real deal i hope howard wasn't believing any of that not that he cares what's the real deal scott  one thing scott that is funny is he puts his name where things could be like if you call him

[03:10:30]  fuck them all let's go to keith in jersey keith what's up hopey good morning hey i gotta tell you  you know for all the times you guys were counting how much time you were spending talking about stern  and serious yeah it was the best bit ever for two reasons a number one it's just hysterical  listen you get more fired up than anthony does about stuff but two i don't know for some reason  every moron i know is picking up a serious and i'm like i record some of these bits where you're 
[03:11:00]  talking about you've got actual facts because when i get the heat of it i lose all my facts i just give  a cd with a couple mp3s burned from your stuff and it just shuts them up you know from whether or not  it's a matter of that they don't have a true uh a true uh receiver where you walk around and hear  and stuff to stuff stern's done anything and everything it just shuts them all up so i want  you to keep talking about serious keep talking about stern because it's it's the most entertaining  part of my day all right and and the other thing is this pal talk thing i'm a mac uh consultant 
[03:11:30]  and you guys gotta do something to talk to these people so the mac users can see this stuff too  so three faggots with macs can uh get online mac is incompatible with everybody dude it's the way  apple does shit good morning bologna did they're completely incompatible with everything they're  arrogant man actually actually it's not bologna i think it's chocolate pudding why do they do that  you can't even right click on mac they blow actually you can now you can now but you get to 
[03:12:00]  expand the window you gotta just drag it it's fucking awful i have a mac but you need you need  a regular windows computer also you can't just have a mac of course you can't stop believing the hype  no you can't just have a mac dude and function in this world max were great when compared with dos  and c prompt they were convenient but compared to fucking windows if mac was compatible with  everything if they weren't such arrogant cunts with their software i would like them  but ipod they're just extremely arrogant i love uh mac i use uh all kinds of graphics programs on it 
[03:12:30]  but when it comes to just going online and uh doing your daily work that you do and playing games  windows like no windows machine is ready to go out of the box all the cool stuff you got to add that  stuff yourself and the problem is is a lot of mac users don't know where to get that stuff i've been  doing nothing but mac support for 20 years if apple stopped making the mac i'd be a pastry chef  you know but because i i hate windows but the bottom line is another goddamn guy that hates windows 
[03:13:00]  there is such a this animosity between the hippie mac people and the corporate uh windows people  i do corporate mac support yeah i work for an ad agency in midtown i'm over on 42nd street in  news building dude good luck to you keep up your good name they're inconvenient dude macs are  inconvenient all right no viruses i know that's true because no one cares about mac enough to give  it a virus you know who else doesn't have viruses thanks fat chicks because no one fucks them  fuck it out all right let's go to theo in jersey theo theo yeah hey hey let's call this

[03:24:30]  many months it's been i don't know i think it was october right somewhere around there it's gotta be four  months five months almost five months yeah almost five months or so around there  there are still katrina victims at new york hotels and uh the hotels are now saying  could you leave like we're done taking care of you you have to leave they've been uh living there  without having to pay by the way fema other agencies charities have been paying their way so now 
[03:25:00]  uh these black leaders have gotten up and are protesting these hotels saying uh that they shouldn't  be kicking these people out they're throwing them out on the street uh have they given them enough time  to get i mean to even set up shop here in new york get a job here do something they're sitting in  these fucking hotels eating off the government till and now protesting that they're getting thrown out 
[03:25:30]  and to top it off they want fifteen hundred dollars per family to leave they're asking the hotel to pay  them to get the fuck out how how how is this going on i don't know look i'm not saying they should be  able to stay in hotels forever but get the fuck out everything they have they've pretty much lost uh  i have a certain amount of empathy for them and that's good you everything you have is gone 
[03:26:00]  you have to not only can you lose everything but you have to relocate you by the nature of what  happened so it's like now you're in a new place you don't know what's good if you can go back to  your home it where you used to live i don't know that's that's a rough do you think in these five  months that they're staying at this hotel that they are working to get out of that hotel that they  are saying let me take this five months let me take the money that has come in uh through charities  various organizations and get my life back in order something instead of sitting uh in a hotel 
[03:26:30]  in new york until they go to throw you out and then going hey what what what i thought i was going  to be able to stay here forever and you gotta think a lot of these people aren't going to make a move  until someone finally does kick them out that's true a lot of them won't but why would you uh you  know try to make something of yourself when you know that uh well that old argument didn't the  fucking oil companies make the biggest profits ever this year or something i mean it's like even  after all that shit we were all taking a hit at the pump everyone was getting fucked except for  them they they made as much money as they should have so fuck them i'm not saying people have been 
[03:27:00]  fucked on uh you know fucking over people on the other end but there are people that have been in  these hotels for five months it's time to leave without uh you know an argument or a goddamn protest  or black leaders showing up to say that it's racist just get the fuck out no it's just time  it's time it's just time to move on are they getting the hotels getting paid full price or  they getting paid partial price because the hotels do have a right to want their uh one of the hotels 
[03:27:30]  were uh we're in the middle of renovating so they're like we need everyone out of the fucking place so we  can get our business going let's go to chip in houston chip oh come on guys i don't even want to hear it  you have nowhere near the your fair share we are inundated 70 percent increase in violence at the  uh in the hotels where they're staying at in apartment complexes oh really free dude it's  unbelievable i can't even imagine so they're not behaving themselves that's oh absolutely not
