<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics and featured numerous guests.  The show opened with a "Worst of the Week" countdown, the number one spot being a hilarious, fictional phone call from a deceased James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, offering profane commentary on his own death.  This segment also included a countdown of other noteworthy moments.  Chris Rock made a brief in-studio appearance, sharing a funny anecdote about making his entourage buy oversized clothes.  A recurring caller, Lady Di, provided an update on her life, which remained remarkably unchanged from a previous call nine years prior, involving joblessness, heavy drinking, potentially trading sex for rent, and a past encounter with Ron Jeremy.  Action star Jason Statham, alongside Rob Bartlett from the Imus in the Morning show,  was interviewed about his new film "Redemption," stunt work,  the varying amenities of actors' trailers, his diet, and the occasional unpleasant encounters on movie sets.  The show also teased upcoming appearances by Joe Piscopo, Amy Schumer,  Ricky Gervais, and Elijah Wood.

The show then transitioned into a discussion about the ambiguous ending of the TV show *Wilfred*, exploring the actors' perspectives and the hostsâ€™ preferences for ambiguous versus conclusive endings. This segment featured a phone call with Joe Piscopo, who shared humorous anecdotes about fatherhood and his legal battles, and even performed a Bruce Springsteen impression.  Advertisements and mentions of Amy Schumer and Ricky Gervais as other guests that week were interspersed throughout.

A substantial portion of the broadcast focused on the reaction of *Saturday Night Live* cast member Bobby Moynihan ("Drunk Uncle") to a previous Opie and Anthony bit harshly criticizing his Sandy Relief concert performance.  The hosts replayed the scathing commentary, comparing Moynihan unfavorably to Kanye West.  An in-studio interview with Moynihan (conducted by Sam Roberts) followed, where he revealed his long-time fandom and expressed mortification at hearing the criticism.  Other in-studio guests during this segment included Amy Schumer and Steve Byrne.  Their conversation veered into a discussion about dick pics and Amy Schumer's recent jaw injury after being punched by a cab driver, including details about her recovery and resulting lawsuit. More advertisements were included here.

The show further delved into a discussion about comedy, freedom of speech, audience reactions, and the line between intended humor and unintentional offense, referencing incidents like Michael Richards' outburst and Daniel Tosh's rape joke.  The hosts debated comedians' responsibilities and the concept of "collateral damage" in free speech, contrasting the expression of opinions with incitement to violence.  They also discussed "militant atheists" and the misuse of the term "freedom of speech."

The broadcast featured multiple interviews with Duff McKagan of Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver.  These interviews covered his experiences in various bands, internal band dynamics, the evolution of their performance habits (including late show starts), and the differences in energy between Guns N' Roses and Jane's Addiction.  McKagan shared anecdotes about his upbringing, early musical training, internal conflicts and drug use within Guns N' Roses, unusual guest singers at the Viper Room (including Sporty Spice), the challenges of following Metallica on tour, the diverse lineups of European festivals, the energy and internal dynamics of Jane's Addiction, his songwriting and touring with Velvet Revolver, and receiving his belated high school diploma.  He also discussed his struggles with alcoholism and a near-fatal incident involving a headbutt from his own security guard.  Throughout the McKagan interviews, the hosts interjected with comedic commentary and questions, and several advertisements for various products and services were aired.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  A celebrity finding out that ONA has been trashing them.  Big surprise there.  Elijah Wood, Ricky Gervais, one of the funniest men on the planet.  Jason Statham, Amy Schumer, a ton of stuff to get to.  What we're going to start with is Chris Rock.  He was wandering around the hallways at Sirius XM.  I guess he's going to film a movie here soon.  And saw Opie and Anthony, and had to stop in and say hello to the guys.  So here's where we start on this week's Countdown.  Chris Rock.  Number nine.  Is that Chris Rock?  Did we get in?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:00:30]  Chris.  I'm only came in because of Norm.  Yeah.  We know that.  We know that.  How you been, man?  What's going on, brother?  How are you?  Come on.  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  Lady Di.  You guys are on the air?  Yeah.  Yeah, we just pop on here.  You don't have a story or anything?  Lady Di, we'll get back to you.  We got Chris Rock in studio.  What's up, man?  Our pal.  What's going on?  Is there a movie being shot here?  Just the one with dice.  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  You know what's weird? 
[00:01:00]  When dice was dice?  Yeah.  He's still dice.  But, uh...  Because all the guys used to dress just like dice, too.  Yeah, yeah.  He'd be like dice in the dice sets.  You know what I mean?  Like, all you guys had on leather jackets, like, you know.  He made everybody buy...  He took us out on a shopping spree one day, and he made us buy dice stuff.  He's like, nah, you gotta get that t-shirt in, like, a size XXL.  And he's just like, dice, what the fuck?  I want something, like, more form-fitting.  Ah, nah, nah, nah, nah. 
[00:01:30]  He made us buy...  You'd have to buy stuff like him.  It was black hoodies that were way too big.  Yeah, way too big.  And I'm like, look, if you give me a medium or a large, I'll wear this.  And he refused.  Now, that's how everyone wears.  Right, right.  And you gotta dress like him, because...  Yeah.  Dice was in L.A., and Eddie Murphy and Stallone made everybody dress like them.  Exactly.  So all of those guys look like N.E.T.s and Stalloneettes, and, you know.  I'm shooting a movie here next week, so I gotta, like... 
[00:02:00]  So all these people are with you?  Yeah.  Wow.  That is a hell of an entourage, man.  It fills the hall.  It's a movie.  They're like, they actually have real jobs.  That's true, yeah.  No one's job is to, like, you know, clean my rims or anything.  Where's the snarky-looking girl with the headset on that tells everybody what to do?  I don't hire any people anymore.  Oh, no.  You know this...  Yeah, exactly.  You're just potential losses.  Wait, we need to add that.  Hold on, we gotta tell you one thing before you leave. 
[00:02:30]  There's controversy around your movie.  They removed a Paul McCartney autograph for you.  What?  What are you talking about?  In the lobby, there's, like, a pillar.  And Paul McCartney signed that.  And Keith Richards.  And also Keith Richards.  And they removed it.  And they said it's because of the movie you're filming.  Really?  They didn't talk to you.  They just cut it out.  They cut out the section.  They cut out the sheetrock.  And they were gonna do that anyway, and this was the excuse to do it.  They cut out the section, and they preserved the autograph on a piece of...  Sheetrock.  On sheetrock.  They probably made the movie pay for it.  That's what they were waiting for. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  I gotta go deal with these guys.  Good seeing you, Chris.  Good seeing you, Chris.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You at the gym?  You at the gym?  You still doing it?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, look at him.  Oh, is that the gym?  It's eating better.  See you, man.  Great.  Chris Rock, everyone.  Later, Chris.  Stopping in to say hi.  Look at all the people he comes around with.  There's like 20 people in there.  This is hilarious.  There's people with folders and papers, and right now they're looking at lights.  Like, look, he's looking up at the incandescent, the fluorescent lights.  I want to be in the movie.  I should have asked.  They're just wandering around.  Yeah.  Taking a look.  You blew it, dude. 
[00:03:30]  Hey, I could be in the movie.  That's so...  There's just so many people out there.  That's so cool.  It's amazing.  Filming a movie here.  Chris Rock movie.  Wow.  The worst of the week countdown.  Countdown.  First of the week countdown, highlighting the wonderful moments that happened on this  week's Opie and Anthony show with me, Sam Roberts.  Lady Di is one of my favorite people to call in, only because she infuriates so many of  you, and quite frankly, so many of us in studio.  She's been an on-again, off-again character on the Opie and Anthony show for many years. 
[00:04:00]  She called in to update us on what was going on in her life, which hasn't changed much in  the last nine years.  It's Lady Di on the Worst of the Week countdown.  Number eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Eight.  Number eight.  Who's this?  Who's this?  Who do you think it is?  Hi, Opie.  Whoa.  Wait, who is this?  It's Di. 
[00:04:30]  Diana.  Lady Di.  I don't remember.  Oh, you don't remember.  No, I'm serious.  Who are you?  You know who I am?  Explain.  I don't know who you are.  Oh, my God.  We talk to hundreds of people a day.  Who is this?  All right.  Well, we used to come over to the studio, Marion and I.  We used to come over there at, you know, WNEW and everything.  Doesn't really ring a bell.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Anthony.  Hello.  Do you guys know this?  Brod.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  No, no, no.  We just wanted to find out if you guys are going to be available.  Are you going to be in the studio next Friday?  Not this Friday.  Next Friday.  For what?  We just want to find out if you're either going to be there or on vacation.  You know.  Are I on the chain?  I don't know.  Why do you want to know if we're going to be here next Friday?  Because we're going to stop by.  Who?  Oh, God.  Me and Marion.  Who's Marion? 
[00:05:30]  Hi to everybody.  What?  She says hi to everybody.  But who is this Marion?  Who are you?  It's Marion and me.  Oh, my God.  You know who we are.  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Oh.  Does that ring a bell?  A little bit.  All right.  That's like many, many years ago.  It sort of rings a bell.  Yeah, well, you still consider us the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  I haven't considered you anything in many, many years. 
[00:06:00]  Ugh.  Ugh.  That voice.  Yeah, okay.  How are you doing with the drinking?  It's okay.  Are you doing?  I drink occasionally.  Yes.  I drink occasionally.  When's the last time you drank, and don't lie?  Yesterday.  Okay, well, then, what was the occasion?  It was Monday.  The occasion was I was home.  So what was the, last time you called, you said you didn't go out for a job.  What job hunting did you do?  Oh, right.  Oh, very good. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, yeah, I did.  Yeah, no, I went out looking for a job and everything.  I went out looking for a couple of jobs.  So what did you do?  I went over to Dunkin' Donuts, which is in my neighborhood.  Right.  Sure.  I went over there.  And, um...  Are we listening to a phone call from 12 years ago?  Yeah.  Huh?  What?  How is it that someone's life doesn't change at all?  Not an iota.  Nope.  What do you mean...  This phone call could be 12 years old.  Right.  No, no. 
[00:07:00]  I mean, I've been out looking for a job.  You're still a drunk making believe you're not a drunk that's making believe that she's  actually going to find work.  No, please.  This is a 12-year phone call.  Yeah, but no, no, no.  Yeah, but no, no, no.  I've actually been out looking for a job.  Oh, so how is that going?  Iraq, find a phone call from 12 years ago, please.  This is the exact same fucking shit.  I have to wait for these places to call me back.  No, but how many places did you look for?  Well, last time we talked to you, we established that you service Bill Orly for your rent. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  Yes, we did.  We did.  Wait, wait.  I'm behind on this one because I wasn't here that day.  She sucks the guy's cock that she's staying at the place.  Oh, don't do that.  Yes, you did.  You admitted it.  You admitted it.  He treats your mouth like a pocket vagina.  Right.  Oh, Jesus.  No.  No disrespect.  You're a fleshlight with a dim bulb.  A flesh heavy.  By the way, by the way.  Oh, what? 
[00:08:00]  I'm going to go see the monkeys.  No one asked you.  Yeah.  I'm going to go see them, July 17th.  Yeah.  In Red Bank.  Remember the Cal Basie Theater, Jim?  I do, yes.  How does he remember?  That's where they're going to be at.  We learned last time she called in, instead of looking for jobs, she sits at home and watches  the monkeys.  She watches the monkeys and the Pardish family.  But who gives a fuck that you're going to see the monkeys?  Who gives a fudge? 
[00:08:30]  Why not?  Oh, why would that be interesting to anyone?  It's not.  Tell Opie the Ron Jeremy story that you called in to tell.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I met Ron Jeremy and he gave me a t-shirt.  Holy fuck.  I looked up and down and I said, well, hey, you know.  I was just imagining what he would look like naked, you know.  Yeah, it's hard to find images of that.  Yeah.  Just look in a mirror.  You know, that bothered him. 
[00:09:00]  I mean, I don't know.  What I'm trying to say is, I, you know, I was trying to imagine him like he looked years  ago.  We understand.  I remember him years ago.  What the fuck?  Who gives a fuck about any of this?  Do you remember how she just would have this inane conversation?  I heard when she finally came back, I think on Sam's show.  And then the next day I was out and you guys talked to her.  It's like, but this is the exact same shit from 12 years ago.  Yeah.  But it bothered her, Ron Jeremy, that she looked at him like that.  He didn't like it.  He remembered the incident.  He felt it was really kind of dehumanizing and he's beyond that point. 
[00:09:30]  And you were supposed to apologize and you never did.  I don't know what he felt like when I was looking at him.  Well, I'm telling you because I know him.  A lot of people look at him.  Not like that.  Not like the way you, because he mentioned that to me.  No, no, no.  Not like that.  Okay.  But anyway, I got a free t-shirt.  No, tell him what you said, though.  Because that was the big thing, like the interaction that you had.  The interaction I had?  With you, it's an O shirt.  No, no, no, no.  She's fat.  They're brand new shirts. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, no, no, they're brand new shirts.  Wait a minute, hold on.  So you're looking for a job?  I'm looking for a job?  She's the female chip.  No, no, no.  Has that been said yet?  Yeah.  What about married?  They don't know anything about me looking for a job.  But they both are.  You went to Dunkin' Donuts, right?  Yeah, what'd you do?  Did you dunk a bunch of them?  And what happened?  What happened there?  I don't know.  What do you mean you don't know?  What did you do?  You just walked in and stared?  I just filled out the application.  What did you do?  You filled out an application.  What did you do besides clear the fucking racks? 
[00:10:30]  I just filled out the application, and I'm waiting for them to call me back.  Wait, wait, wait.  Can I start from the beginning?  I haven't...  Oh, forget it.  And by the way, the liquor store, too.  Of course.  Oh, good.  Donuts, liquor.  Why would they hire you?  Donuts, liquor.  That's brilliant.  Lady Di.  What?  That's the whole statement.  It's a job.  Yeah.  I believe I haven't seen or talked to you in eight years.  It's Chris.  In eight years.  Yeah.  Could you explain one thing?  I haven't talked to you in eight years.  These guys have talked to you recently. 
[00:11:00]  What has changed in your life in eight years?  Good question.  Last we checked in, you were blowing hobos, I believe.  No.  That never happened.  I guess it did.  So what has changed in eight years?  Well, we have a place to stay.  Me and my roommate.  He's your boyfriend.  He's your fucking...  Yeah, you blow him.  You blow him so you don't have to pay rent.  Exactly.  Come on.  Let's...  No, no, no.  I help out with the bills around here the best I could. 
[00:11:30]  But you...  How?  You don't have a job.  His name is Bill.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  But don't let her off the hook.  How do you help out with the bills?  Well, whenever I can.  But you...  Like Anne said, you don't have a job, so where's...  Where's this money coming from to pay the bills?  Alfie.  My dad left me money, okay?  Son of a bitch.  She's been living off her dead dad.  Her dead dad's money.  No, no, no, no.  That's...  No, no, no.  Both my parents left me money.  How much?  Oh, that's none of anybody's business.  How much?  How much?  Ballpark. 
[00:12:00]  It wasn't millions, if that's what you're asking.  No, we don't think it's millions.  Was it more than $30?  Yes.  More than $30.  More than $30.  All right.  All right.  Was it $10,000?  Something like that.  Somewhere around there.  $13,000.  Okay?  $13,000.  So you went through that already.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Well, she doesn't pay rent.  She doesn't...  She blows the guy for rent.  She sucks in cock for rent.  So we know she spends some money on booze.  She sucks dick to get her rent paid.  Okay.  Imagine how proud her dead dad would be.  Oh, God.  Right?  He left me $18,000 and then another $13,000, $14,000 on top of that. 
[00:12:30]  What?  So how much do you leave you?  $30,000?  Just say that.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Don't just keep giving us...  Something like that.  Don't give us figures that make us do the math.  Just tell us.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Lady Di, hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  I begged DRock to find a clip of Lady Di.  He found one from 2004?  The beginning of November 2004.  We were on there for a month.  It's a quick clip, right?  This clip is almost nine years old. 
[00:13:00]  Nine years old.  All right.  This is going to make my point.  Go ahead.  Still out there looking for a job.  Yeah, sure you are.  Yeah.  Pounding the...  Well, not now.  Pounding the pavement.  Well, at least you sound kind of sober today.  She does that whenever she walks.  I am sober today.  What are you trying...  What job are you looking for?  A tequila worm eater?  No.  No.  No, no, no.  Jobs in town.  I'm trying to look like all over the place.  Clothing stores, all that other stuff.  That must be where you are now, right?  Looking for work? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  So where are you?  Same conversation.  Well, I'm at home right now.  Oh, you're at home right now.  That's where all the jobs are.  Okay, that's from nine years ago.  Wow.  Dude, that's 2004.  Yeah, and we're having the same conversation nine years later.  Lady Di, did you hear that?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I'm sorry.  Let's put her back on.  Yes.  Lady Di, did you hear that?  Musetta.  Yeah.  Now, that was you nine years ago.  Same conversation.  Nine years ago?  Oh, and then she repeats.  Remember this, Opie?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Wasn't I kind of like homeless nine years ago? 
[00:14:00]  Well, you're homeless now.  You're a bum now.  If you aren't sucking cock anymore.  Because you're sucking dick.  She's questioning the old version of herself.  Right, right.  That was you.  Wait a minute.  Were you homeless or not?  I don't know.  That was you from nine years ago saying that you were at home looking for a job.  I got you.  I got you on this one.  All right, that was nine years ago.  Now I remember.  Okay, tell us something, Lane.  But don't you find it a little disheartening, Lady Di, that you're having the same exact  conversation with us nine years later and nothing has improved in your life? 
[00:14:30]  You're expecting different results?  Nothing has been improving because there's really no work out there, whether you believe  it or not.  There's really not that much work.  Nine years!  And you're not looking for a position at IBM.  She's been looking for work.  There's no jobs at radio, but I think there's still jobs at D&D.  She's been looking for work so long that when she started, the economy was good.  Right, the economy was good when you started.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, well, I guess not for me.  What?  A little chuckle.  That was a great chuckle.  Lady Di.  What are you doing?  Not just the name.  I remember it.  Why don't you fucking work?  I don't know.  Yes, you do.  Yes, you do.  I really don't know.  I go there.  No, you don't.  You're not looking for a job.  You're lying.  You're a liar.  You're a compulsive liar. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  You're not being honest with anybody.  You're lying to yourself.  What do I say to you?  Get sober.  That's why.  Get sober.  And get a job.  You lost your son.  You didn't take care of him.  What's that?  I didn't lose him.  Yeah, you did.  Yeah, you did.  You didn't raise him.  During the time where he needed a mother and needed a mother that was going to support  him, you fucking did nothing for him and he had to leave your house, because you didn't  have one at that point, and live with other people. 
[00:16:00]  Who said I was living with other people?  What did you just eat?  Oh, my God.  What were you paying first and last?  What did you just eat?  Dick in the mouth.  Dick in the mouth.  Dick in the mouth to take me back then.  That's fucking July's rent right there in our fucking mouth.  It's just unloaded July.  All right, look.  I will pay the rent.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I can't take her anymore.  All right.  Answer this simple question.  Good luck with this.  Sure.  What did you just eat? 
[00:16:30]  What did I just eat?  I had a steak last night at London Boyle.  What did you just put in your mouth?  Oh, a cigarette.  You just ate a cigarette?  What are you, a fucking goat?  Well, you know, it's kind of like hard to put a cigarette in your mouth when you have  a cell phone in one hand and one free hand.  Yeah, I know.  I need at least two hands to juggle when I put it. 
[00:17:00]  No, it's not.  It's easy to do.  Right.  That's easy to do if you're that fucking, if you're Steve Gleason could do that.  Oh, no.  Now, see?  I have to get one of those handsets for this phone or a different phone anyway.  How about get a job?  Yeah.  How are you affording cigarettes?  Get a job, die.  How are you affording cigarettes?  Good question.  You have to give up the ass.  How do I afford cigarettes?  Do you give up the ass for the cigarettes?  I think cigarettes are just handjobs.  No, Opie, no.  Oh, then it must be your dead dad's money. 
[00:17:30]  I thought it was a real fucking question.  I'm sorry.  Well, you know what?  You know what?  And that's a pretty sensitive subject right now.  What is, sweetheart?  What is?  What's sensitive?  Oh, my dad.  That's a pretty sensitive subject.  Why?  He's dead.  He passed away.  What's sensitive about it?  I don't know he passed away.  Yes, he did.  How was Father's Day when you're spending his hard-earned money on beer and fucking cigarettes?  No, I spent...  How was...  Happy Father's Day there?  What'd you do?  How'd you do?  I spent his hard-earned money on putting flowers on his grave.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What'd you go with? 
[00:18:00]  Fucking plastic...  I went with my roommate.  Oh, did you suck...  Did you suck his cock on your dad's grave?  No, I did not.  I wouldn't.  Oh, come on.  I wouldn't do stuff like that.  Obviously not.  Hey, Chris.  I love Blink.  It's my favorite.  I don't do stuff like that.  And I don't think anybody else did either.  I didn't see anything else going on in the cemetery, so I don't do stuff like that.  All right.  Yeah.  Lady Di. 
[00:18:30]  I worry about it.  I will get a job.  No, you won't.  You said this.  Nine years ago.  Nine years.  Nine years.  Nine years.  Nine years you said this.  For nine fucking years.  You're not getting a job.  Nine fucking years.  Well, what do you want me to do?  Get a job!  Why don't you get a fucking job?  And they don't call you back.  No, because you're a babbling idiot.  Yeah.  First of all, you probably don't present yourself well.  Right.  You probably go in there with your big, bloated W.C. Fields face when you're fucking drunkard. 
[00:19:00]  And then you babble like an idiot, where they throw the application away before the fucking bell rings when you're leaving the door.  And then you fucking, yes!  And then you don't, like, follow up.  You're the one that's supposed to call them.  I know that.  But I have their call number.  That was just so mean.  Of course it was.  It's true.  I guess I'd like to apply for a position in your organization. 
[00:19:30]  Ah, yes!  Perhaps I could put jelly in the donuts!  Ah, yes!  You fucking pig!  She could be the most frustrating person I've ever fucking come across.  No, I'm not the most frustrating person.  I think you are.  I think you are.  I need a position to make some currency to purchase more alcoholic beverages!  Yeah! 
[00:20:00]  Oh, boy, oh, boy.  Blowing WC.  She is.  The Worst of the Week Countdown.  Welcome back to the Worst of the Week Countdown with me, Sam Roberts, host of After Opie and Anthony Live.  And you hear me every morning on the air with Opie and Anthony.  A lot to get to this week.  Joe Piscopo called in again.  I don't know why, but he did.  Amy Schumer was in studio.  Tony Soprano called in from beyond the grave. 
[00:20:30]  Ricky Gervais stopped by.  We'll get to all that soon.  First, Jason Statham.  Arguably the greatest action hero of this generation.  You know, I mean, he's not Stallone.  He's not Schwarzenegger.  But they're older gentlemen at this point.  Jason Statham is still doing the damn thing.  He's also a great guest.  He stopped by this week.  Rob Bartlett from the Imus in the Morning radio show was in studio with us.  Enjoy.  Jason Statham on the Worst of the Week Countdown. 
[00:21:00]  And now we say hi to Jason Statham.  You want a donut?  We got donuts.  Oh, my God.  Yeah?  No, I'm all right.  You don't eat donuts, right?  He's not a donut guy.  You can tell.  No, you can tell.  Jason Statham's not a donut guy.  He's got to be in shape.  They're all right.  They're all right.  He's got to be in shape.  And that's Rob Bartlett, a very funny man to your left.  All right, man.  Just so you know everyone in the room there, Jason.  Jason's all over my fucking, my on-demand. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, yeah?  What was that, Parker?  Yeah, Parker, yeah.  That was the last time I saw it.  No good?  Yeah, no, I like it, man.  Your fucking movies are great.  Come on.  Action-packed.  Fucking fun.  You know what you're getting with a Jason Statham movie, man?  I love that, man.  Fuck.  Great.  What do you got coming out now?  It's a film called Redemption.  Redemption?  Yeah.  It was called Hummingbird in the UK, but they renamed it.  Yeah, good idea.  Yeah.  Good thing.  They renamed it because they thought Hummingbird was a little bit twee. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  What was the motive for Hummingbird?  Like, what was, what does it mean?  Hummingbird is a generic term for like a military drone that basically, the story's about an ex-soldier  that is basically, one of these drones pays witness to something bad that he does.  And basically, his conscience gets the better of him and he can't live with himself.  And he takes to the streets and starts living as a homeless person.  So the Hummingbird is, you know, is quite an appropriate sort of title for the film. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, but the redemption part kind of makes more sense, yeah.  Well, it's a little easier.  It's a little easier to put on people.  They'll be like, all right, it's redemption.  Hummingbird, they're like, what?  Yeah, try to get a bunch of guys to go see Hummingbird if they don't know what it's about.  Yeah, I want to go, let's go see Hummingbird.  This sounds good.  Get the money back.  So it's just, it's an action film.  Well, yeah.  I mean, it's, the good thing about it, it's not driven by the action. 
[00:23:00]  It's written by a very, very smart writer that's written a couple of great films.  Eastern Promises, I don't know if you saw.  Oh, yeah.  That was great.  That was good.  Fucking brutal, that movie.  Yeah, so there was a movie before that called Dirty Pretty Things, and these are tales around the city of London, which are, you know, thrillers based in London.  This is the third part of, you know, an unrelated story, but by Stephen Knight, it was the writer.  This is his first attempt as a director, and, you know, he's brilliant. 
[00:23:30]  He really nailed it.  First attempt.  Yeah.  So do you look at that and be like, are you like, oh boy, I hope he knows what he's doing.  Of course you do, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you know pretty quickly if someone knows what they're doing, by the way, they sort of...  And if they have a good support staff around them, too.  I mean, he really did put the best group of people around him.  Yeah.  A good deep.  That helps.  You know what?  I am convinced you could know nothing about directing a movie, and if you put the right people around you, you can be a brilliant director. 
[00:24:00]  That's the key to anything.  You surround yourself with people better than you.  Yes.  Well, you guys know about that.  Well...  Yeah, yeah.  That's...  So, some gunplay in this one?  Not a lot.  Not a lot of gunplay?  Nothing, really.  He starts working for a group of people.  He starts off washing dishes. 
[00:24:30]  Basically, he starts to rehabilitate himself.  He's a homeless chap on the streets.  And he starts to rehabilitate himself.  He gets off the booze, gets off the drugs, and starts to, you know, wash dishes in Chinatown.  And then all of a sudden starts working for this Chinese boss and starts, you know, throwing a bit of muscle around and earning some money, basically, to keep his daughter...  To put away for his daughter, as a strange daughter that he doesn't see anymore.  Good-hearted guy.  Yeah, good-hearted guy. 
[00:25:00]  And that's the start of, you know, a change for the good.  But then he finds out that, you know, when he's sober, that he's a bit of a... he's a bit of a nuisance.  And he... he starts to, you know, he has to sort of throw himself to the wayside again because it becomes too dangerous.  How does the movie end?  I can tell you're really fucking interested.  You know?  We're going to get somebody like that one day.  Somebody's going to slip and...  We try that every time. 
[00:25:30]  How does it end?  Right.  I should have come up in a different movie, shouldn't I?  So, it's... it's a musical?  It should have been.  It's not a musical, no.  Your films have grossed over a fucking billion dollars?  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Your films have grossed over a billion dollars, man.  I didn't see much of that billion.  I can tell you.  Damn them.  You were misinformed.  Someone got rich, not me.  Over a billion.  Yeah.  Wow.  We haven't paid for this and that yet.  You know, we've got to recoup this and that. 
[00:26:00]  Stamps.  Ah, what are you going to do?  Yeah.  There's a lot of expenses that go through.  Yeah.  Any word on Expendables?  Yeah, I'm going to go and do Expendables Part 3.  Right.  Nice.  We're going to go and shoot in Bulgaria.  In Bulgaria, huh?  In the middle of August, we start, yeah.  That's a fun franchise, right?  Yeah, you can't say no to that.  Please.  Yeah.  So, is I going to complete the trilogy?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Are the same guys in it? 
[00:26:30]  Or is there anybody new in it that wasn't in the last one?  Um, listen, they're bandying around a lot of names and I'm not sure who they're going to say yes to and who wants to come to do the job.  But, you know, there's talk of Wesley Snipes and Jackie Chan and Mila Djokovic, the people that, um, you know.  I'm sure, I'm sure with the reaction the first two got that people kind of want to get on board that one.  It's fun.  They're fun movies to watch.  Yeah, they're great.  You just turn up and go, give us the gun and it's...  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:27:00]  You can, you know, eject the mind for a small moment.  Yeah, I know.  I love people that watch that and go, you can't do that.  Exactly.  It doesn't make sense.  Look at how he's driving that thing.  You can't drive like...  Yeah, okay.  Where's the larger?  Yeah, yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Sit back and enjoy it.  Dummy.  What was your favorite film you ever made?  That's a great question.  You know, I think the movies I did for Guy Ritchie would, you know, Snatch and Logstock. 
[00:27:30]  You know, because they were a long time ago and they sort of gave me a job.  They gave me a career.  Snatch is still great.  It's one of those movies you just could watch a million fucking times.  Do you really eat spinach and rice?  No.  Oh, once again.  Reports say he keeps in shape on set by eating a diet of spinach and rice.  Where does that come from?  What turd said that?  I don't know.  You probably ate it once.  Because there was nothing else left or something. 
[00:28:00]  And then that becomes the thing.  There's so much stupid crap that gets written about this thing.  Yes.  What's the stupidest thing?  Probably that.  Oh, wow.  All right.  We made Wikipedia.  Nice.  Love it.  Exactly.  That's a dumb thing to have written about you.  I know, but I just ask it like it's a fucking really Barbara Walters moment.  Spinach and rice.  How many cries?  I really am an asshole.  But yeah, you can't. 
[00:28:30]  You just pull the questions off Wikipedia and you're like, okay, that's what the...  We don't do pre-interviews, obviously.  So we got that one out.  But again, why would I ask that?  Because here's what he could have said.  Yes, I do.  And now where are you going?  Yeah, you want to think out how these things are prepared.  I walked us down a fucking alley into brown or white rice.  It would have to be brown.  Which rice is that?  I would have used it the same way.  Basmati rice it is.  I would have just turned around and said, you know, because I've been eating some spinach 
[00:29:00]  and everyone went, who gives a shit?  And then somebody else would have picked up the...  All right.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Yeah, exactly.  That was fucking terrible.  So what do you eat on saturation?  What do I eat?  Whatever the catering has, you know?  Yeah.  The film sets are good.  They have a...  You know, they've got people that cook you whatever you want.  So whatever you fancy.  Do you have to really concentrate on what you're eating?  Like, make sure you're eating well?  Well, I don't eat these every day.  Right, right, right, right. 
[00:29:30]  You try and be smart if you want to...  You know, if you're trying to train and, you know, you're trying to look good, then  there's a certain thing that you've got to put in your mouth.  So it's...  Do you have, like, a movie physique and, like, hanging around, eating a little shittier physique?  Of course.  Do you get in shape for the movies, yeah?  You know how to get in shape if you want to get in shape, and then you know how to  abuse yourself when you want to abuse yourself.  So it's easy, yes.  Little simple rules.  I only know the abuse.  I'm in transition. 
[00:30:00]  Ron's in transition here.  Earmuffs, Ron.  You're probably right in between.  Earmuffs.  You don't have to listen to this.  Yeah, because some of the movies you're in, obviously, are pretty physically exerting.  I mean, I know there are stuntmen and stuff, but just the running around you've done, especially  a movie like Crank.  Well, you do your own stunt show, don't you?  I mean...  Yeah, I do it.  Yeah, I do this.  I do anything that's, you know, I won't do stupid things like, you know, dive out of 
[00:30:30]  a burning building.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, there's just no point.  And the pyrotechnic crap is just...  It's frightening.  You can't calculate, you know, how far the explosion's going to go.  And, you know, it's a stupid way to die.  Right.  It's your next movie, actually.  A stupid way to die.  That's a good one.  It's almost as good as Hummingbird.  Originally called Nursing Blueberries.  Radar.  I'm sure earlier on, they probably asked you to do more stunts than they do now. 
[00:31:00]  You're probably a little more of a commodity now, I would...  No, that's absolutely true.  Yeah.  You know, you have to get...  You have to sign a waiver if you want to get out of a car.  Are you sure you can do this?  Do you want to put a harness on?  Bring the crash mat in.  He's getting out of the bus.  Yeah, I mean, it's a fucking joke.  It is.  Yeah, yeah.  They get so protected because, you know, they want to finish the film, 
[00:31:30]  and they spend a lot of money, and...  Are there limitations on what they let you do contractually during a filming?  Like, you can't go skiing.  Like, a lot of times they put restrictions on guys.  Yeah, you sign a thing.  You can't go skiing.  You can't do...  You can't race a car.  You can't...  Wow.  There's a big, long list of things, and you sign at the bottom of the page,  and you say, listen, I'm not going to do any of that stuff.  Yeah, no sex with Amanda Bynes.  Things like that.  Very dangerous.  I did crank years ago, and there was a stunt where I have to have a fight outside of the 
[00:32:00]  helicopter, and I'm standing on the skis, and we're having this punch-up, and, you know,  I'm actually outside the helicopter, and I've got the hip-pick, and that they shot on the  last day of filming.  Just in case.  Smart scheduling.  Just in case.  We could get away without this scene.  Yeah, it's need-been.  Wow.  Hey, look, if he falls, we just roll credits. 
[00:32:30]  Holy fuck.  It was literally that way.  Because they couldn't get insurance for that, and they said, listen...  No way.  Oh, they can't?  No.  You want to do it, you've got to do it on the fucking last day.  And how scared were you outside that helicopter?  Be honest.  That's got to be fucking...  Yeah, it was...  Yeah, it was.  But, you know, the adrenaline is...  Sure.  That helps you get through it, right?  Well, yeah, it's scary, but, you know, it feels good when you've done it.  Because Tom Cruise...  Well, it's over, I bet.  Yeah, you're like, fuck, I kicked ass.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Tom Cruise did his own stunts for Mission Impossible 3 or 4, whatever, and I've become  obsessed with that Burge Tower.  The Burge Tower, yeah.  But I'm like, how did he get a movie company?  I don't care how much waivers you sign.  How did Tom Cruise get them to sign off on him jumping at 1,100 feet and running down the  side of that building?  Because he probably said, I'm not going to do your fucking movie unless you let me do this.  What kind of insurance do you have to have?  Because he loves that shit.  It's, you know, it's a surprise, because, you know, his biggest movie star in the world,  how do you let him do something that may or may not...  He must have had about 18 safety wires. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, I'm sure of this.  Do you think they had the best crew working with him?  It's the guy that runs the bungee at a fucking Poughkeepsie carnival.  That's great!  Missing a couple of bolts, but it shouldn't be a problem.  Don't worry about it.  Would you have done that?  We've got some duct tape.  Would you have done that?  I'd have done that, yeah, yeah.  They're safe.  Anything that you see us do, it's, you know, it's pretty fucking safe.  Other, you know, you just need the nuts to go, okay, I'm not scared of heights.  Are you?  No, I'm not scared of heights. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  No, if you've got a fear for heights, then you don't want to be doing that.  But it's pretty safe.  It's not like you're trying to jump from one, a moving vehicle to another,  and if you miss, you're going to smash yourself to pieces.  Yeah.  I mean, you're just on a wire, so you're just running around, and it's just like being on  a fairground ride.  Yeah.  It's pretty safe.  It's not like you've got to exact some skill to try and, you know, have some kind of charge.  I'm just alone for the ride.  Yeah, you're just alone for the ride.  Yeah.  But that's just fucking, my hands sweat when I think of that, like when he's running down 
[00:34:30]  the side of the building.  But, like, the fact that, I know it's safe, but it's like, what if you just hear the feeling  you'd have of floundering all the way down, going, this could have been avoided.  But Jason's ruining movies for us.  I want to know that there's a chance that something could go wrong with this shit.  Of course there's a chance.  Everybody's got a bad day at work, and it could be the guy whose job is to tie the fucking  knot.  But I don't want to hear he's just the one for the ride.  I like to think there's some weird timing that he's got to figure out. 
[00:35:00]  Here's how you know it could be a problem.  They shot that the last day of films.  Yeah, there you go.  That's the indicator that certain things can happen.  People are killed.  Stuntmen are killed.  I mean, it's not a fucking...  Yeah, they have been.  Yeah, you know, I think the most dangerous thing is when there's a guy on the trigger that has to  go, boom, and press the explosion.  Time it right.  And if he gets it wrong, he's like, huh?  Excuse me?  Yeah, make sure nobody's in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Yeah, they're the ones that hold a lot of responsibility.  The pyro guys. 
[00:35:30]  You're in a lot of movies where they have the weapon masters, the guys that have to handle  the guns and make sure that they're not live.  Yeah.  I mean, for the most part, they're real guns that just have blank ammunition in there.  That's correct, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So, I mean, you could definitely still get hurt.  Is that how Brandon Lee dies?  How Brandon Lee dies?  It is, right?  He got...  And John Eric Hexum.  Who's that?  That's right.  I think something got wedged into the barrel.  I think there was something got wedged into the barrel.  Yeah.  Oh, it wasn't an actual bullet. 
[00:36:00]  It was something else.  Yeah, something else.  It was wadding or something, right?  Yeah, and it got stuck in there and...  I mean, I might be wrong.  But it's usually they're fucking around and doing things they're not supposed to be doing  with them at the time.  It's rarely a, you know, oh, someone put something in there and they went through the scene and  it happened.  Like John Eric Hexum, he put the gun to his head.  Who is he?  And pulled the trigger.  He was on a series...  I can't remember the name of the series.  I remember his dumb name, but not the name of the series.  And he put it next to his head and the concussion from the blank actually dislodged the piece 
[00:36:30]  of his skull and it went right into his brain like a bullet, you know?  Oh, yeah.  You can cue yourself with a blank.  Absolutely.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Very dangerous, though.  Embarrassing.  There are limits.  You know, we're shooting blanks all the time, but you've got to be...  There's the distance, the safe distance is a big thing.  Yeah.  There are always eyes too close.  You can't...  Right.  So if I'm pointing the gun at you, it's got to be like that.  Yeah, we usually film it in a way where it looks like...  Yeah.  Why do they have blank...  Why not just use it like where the fucking inside of the gun is filled with something  like lead? 
[00:37:00]  Or it's a solid...  One solid piece, not a real gun.  Because you've got to get the muzzle flash.  You've got to get the...  Oh, right.  It looks better.  The action of the weapon, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the action has to go.  They have a plugged gun.  They do have a plugged barrel.  So if you want to do short...  And then they do...  They put the flesh in in post, but it's more expensive.  CGI.  Did I just sound like I know nothing about guns or the movie business?  Why not use a fake one, mister?  What a naive shit.  I made a couple of videos at the house where I used CGI and stuff. 
[00:37:30]  And it looks...  The effects you could do now with After Effects and stuff, it looked really amazing.  But there's just something about that muzzle flash, the recoil.  If it doesn't have the recoil, it has to have...  A little bit of smoke.  It has to have a little bit of recoil.  It has to have the kickback.  What is that feeling?  And the slide has to slide.  Right, right.  You need to slide, yeah.  You know, the brass needs to come out.  What does that feel like when you're shooting at somebody, even though you know it's a blank? 
[00:38:00]  It's like you're still shooting at somebody.  Huh.  Yeah, but it's a blank.  I would love to do that.  You would love to do that.  I really would, yeah.  But not tell them it's a blank.  Like make a prank show where I'm walking down the street just fake shooting at people.  And they're like, ah!  That would be great.  And I'm like, ah, I gotcha.  And then you could have the...  There's a lot of people that would like to do that, too.  I can't wait for the part of the show where the cops don't fake shoot you.  Because that's what would happen.  Well, it's called season finale.  Yeah.  Are you proficient with weapons?  Do you shoot much real guns? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  They make sure that you get good at that stuff.  They take you to the gun range, and they show you how to go on.  You should learn how to shoot a real one before you do that, just so you have the respect for the gun.  You have to really understand about the safety.  Yeah, yeah.  The on-set safety is a big thing, you know.  You can't be running around.  And as soon as you've done this shot, you have to give it to the gun handler.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't run around having a cup of tea with the old gun. 
[00:39:00]  So as a British subject, what do you think of the assault bans weapon?  The what?  Assault bans weapon.  Assault bans weapon.  Assault bans weapon.  Damn it, you know.  Oh, Rob.  And I'm the one on Vicodin.  Where's the screw?  Where's the screeching?  That's all right.  Assault bans weapon.  It's good.  Assault bans weapon.  Oh, damn it.  This is what eager boy wants to ask.  Like, when you're doing a film like that, you guys are all major A-list guys.  I mean, you know, Schwarzenegger, Stallone.  Is there a difference in the size of the trailer, or is it like everyone gets the same? 
[00:39:30]  Because I hear Will Smith has a fucking tractor trailer that opens up.  It's basically a house.  They wouldn't let him park it with a roof thick.  Yeah, like a two-level thing.  But they wouldn't let him park it on a lot of the streets of New York.  Right.  They made him move it.  It was so ridiculously big and over the top.  And you know Arnold's on that level, and so is Stallone.  And I'm sure you're on that level.  But when you're doing one, do you guys all get that, or do they just fucking kind of size  it down?  Like, look.  It depends, you know. 
[00:40:00]  It depends who you are.  I mean, there is a standard thing that most people get.  And if someone wants to, you know, be Flash, and they've got their own thing going, then  the big movie stars get that.  Who's got the best one you've ever been in?  Um, you know, I haven't been in any of those big ones.  You know, it's funny, when you go and make a movie back in England, you go, is that the  port-aloo?  They go, no, it's his fucking trailer.  Oh, there's a little honey wagon.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's nothing like Hollywood back over there. 
[00:40:30]  No.  I did a movie called Furry Vengeance.  Oh, yes.  Obviously, you've seen it.  Yes.  It's about talking animals, you know.  It's a great moment.  And me and Patrice were in these honey wagons, and it was so small, there's no bathroom,  so I just pissed in the sink all day.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  I'm disgusting.  It's going to take a lot of leaks.  So what?  I'm just a new series I'm starting called Hollywood Glory.  That's the opening story.  But you'd piss in the sink if you had a bathroom anyway.  Oh, absolutely.  That's true.  It was actually in the common area, just showing everybody who was boss. 
[00:41:00]  But you do hear stories about people measuring the trailer, and, you know.  Right.  I think that one's six inches longer than, you know, some stupid story like that you've heard.  That's got to cause resentment.  Without any names, because I know you don't want to do that, but was there anybody with  a little more ego on those sets, the set of Expendables, than other people?  Not only Expendables, no.  I think everyone sort of keeps an even keel, you know, slides the head honcho, and everybody  respects him.  So, yeah, I think everyone sort of behaves themselves. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know it doesn't sound that way.  But I guess these guys who are that, like, you know, Schwarzenegger doesn't need to prove  who he is.  Exactly.  The one doesn't need to prove who he is.  I mean, that's true.  Yeah, there's almost like a mutual respect, because they're all the biggest stars in the  world.  Sure.  So everyone sort of keeps their heads on, you know, because someone started to get out  of line.  They just stand out, you know.  Yeah, you've had to have been on some sets, though, where you're like, oh, that guy's a  fucking asshole.  But I feel you. 
[00:42:00]  Have you ever thought that people might think you were that guy?  Of course.  More often than not.  You never want to think that.  God damn.  Not Jason.  You look at Charlie Sheen now, and I don't know if he had that girl fired or whatever.  There's something going on in the management.  And I'm just like, I don't know what happened.  Because I like Charlie Sheen.  I've never met him, but I like his work, and I want to believe he's a good dude.  I'm starting to think he's the problem.  He might be, man.  I'm starting to think.  He might be. 
[00:42:30]  He might have some issues there.  But I'm like, what a lousy work environment to have that conflict.  That's his co-star.  She's now out of the series.  Is she out, or is she going to be out?  I think they fostered.  He wanted her out or something.  Yeah, they had problems, and that was it.  That's having some pull, if you could do that.  It's a scumbaggy move, but, you know.  It depends on what she did, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She got the yogurt wrong.  Wouldn't fuck him.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  The worst of the week.  Countdown.

[00:44:00]  Ron found out he was in big trouble with the IRS.  Between the state and the feds, I found out I owed $70,000.  Ron had no idea what to do.  There was no way I could have paid that off.  They were getting ready to garnish my wages.  Who knows what else?  Until he heard about 911 tax relief.  911 tax relief.  That was exactly what I needed.  They talked to the IRS for me.  I didn't have to make one phone call.  They just kept those guys off my back.  And within an hour, they had it figured out. 
[00:44:30]  Done.  911 tax relief has an A rating with the Better Business Bureau.

Highlighting the best moments of this week's Opie and Anthony show, it's the Worst of the Week countdown with me, Sam Roberts, from the Opie and Anthony show.  And after Opie and Anthony live, a lot went on this week.  Went on.  I was going to say a lot.  I was going to say going on and went down and it all got mixed up.  But we're still here, aren't we?  We'll get to Tony Soprano calling in from beyond the grave. 
[00:48:00]  We'll get to a celebrity finding out that ONA has been trashing him.  We'll get to Ricky Gervais in studio.  We'll get to all that.  First, I want to play for you Elijah Wood stopping by.  He's not just Frodo Baggins.  He's not just the kid from The Good Son.  He's not just that dude who talks to the guy in the dog suit on Wilfred.  Okay?  He's also a nice man who happens to be a friend of the show.  He stopped by.  He's been on the show a bunch of times.  Always fun hanging with him.  Elijah Wood on the Worst of the Week countdown. 
[00:48:30]  Hot, hot, hot.  Six, six, six.  Number six.  Where did the show leave off?  I'm trying to remember now.  The end of the second season.  It left off with the revelation that this drawing that he finds with Wilfred, like a childhood  drawing with Wilfred in the corner, that he drew it.  Right.  And so we actually start this season with him analyzing what that potentially means as he's  in this sort of existential questioning nightmare. 
[00:49:00]  I have a theory about the show, which I'll ask Elijah about off air.  Oh, not on air.  No spoilers?  I said I want to wreck something.  Well, that's a spoiler.  If I'm right.  He doesn't have to nod or anything.  Well, there isn't actually a definitive answer yet.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Even amongst the creators.  Like, I have a theory.  I think the writers have a theory.  But no one has actually said, well, this is definitively it.  Okay.  Because even Jason, like, Jason thinks that Wilfred is a magical being.  Hmm. 
[00:49:30]  I don't agree with that.  But I think for Jason to play the character from a truthful place, he has to think that  the character's weird.  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  That seems scary that they don't have it figured out yet, though.  Hmm.  Where they're kind of just, they have it figured out, right?  They might have an idea.  I think they have it figured out.  It's not like Lost-ian, you know, where they were, like, making it up as they went along.  I think the conceit is probably what the conceit is.  Okay.  But it is up for interpretation.  And I think the reality is we'll never actually really tell you, because I think that kind 
[00:50:00]  of ruins what the show is.  Everyone wants to be told.  Everyone wants everything wrapped up in that nice package.  But then when it is, then it's like, oh, that was kind of a letdown.  Now, obviously, with what happened with James Gandolfini dying, you think of The Sopranos  and how that ended.  Right.  And people were like, oh, what the hell is that?  And then as time goes by, you realize how brilliant that ending was.  That ending was incredible.  And what did you want?  A slow motion Sam Peckinpah kind of shootout in the place? 
[00:50:30]  It just would have been, eh.  You know, so.  Yeah.  You're right.  There is something to be said for not giving people exactly what they think they want.  Totally.  At that moment.  See, I think my idea is probably wrong, man.  What's that, Jim?  I thought they were going to show a faraway shot of the dog walking away, wearing like  a hat, like at the end of Silence of the Lambs, and it says, I'm having an old friend for  dinner.  And that's the last time.  What awful endings to movies you have.  I know.  I really do.  I love a good, awful ending.  Just something that totally wrecks the whole fucking vibe. 
[00:51:00]  I think it's a bit like Harvey.  Did you ever see the movie with Jimmy Stewart?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The rabbit.  Yeah.  So he's got this best friend that no one else can see, but only he can see, and at the  end of the movie, he gives Harvey to somebody else.  But you never, they never explain what Harvey is.  Right.  So.  You assume that it isn't a real thing.  It's, you know.  Right.  Some kind of mental thing.  Well, does the person take Harvey, or do they go, what is this?  You're handing me air.  Well, no.  This doctor actually sees Harvey and needs him for, to better his life. 
[00:51:30]  You've seen that movie too, Ant, huh?  Yeah.  That was a long time ago.  It's a classic.  It's a great film.  Yeah.  Ant has seen everything.  Literally.  It's unbelievable.  Are you a big movie buff?  I grew up on TV, movies.  Yeah.  Yes.  It's just forever.  Tunnel visioning television as alcoholism raged behind him in the living room.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There were, you know, parental discussions going on while I just focused. 
[00:52:00]  That's not happening.  No, that's not happening.  As the spaghetti hits the wall, they were just discussions.  Yeah.  They were discussions.  He did debates.  Parental discussions.  Yes.  They were very passionate about their opinions, that they threw in the word, you're a fuck  face every so often, while giving their opinions.  Well, just to pepper the word a little bit.  Block it out.  Just focus on crisp toothpaste.  He's the best toothpaste.  What a other genius.  He's just fucking greatest recall for colorism.  TV was like, you know, growing up, that was my entire life. 
[00:52:30]  Go outside.  My mother used to have to throw me out of the house to get me out.  I was just fixated.  Everything.  Commercials.  I just would love watching commercials over and over again.  The old cigarette.  Before they banned cigarette commercials, a little kid just sitting there, you know,  singing the Tijuana Smalls jingles and Doral.  Remember Doral with the taste chambers?  Taste me, taste me.  No one else remembers.  Come on and taste me.  Take a puff and let me do my stuff.  See, this is what we're talking about a lot. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  They were like, he's a rain man.  It's incredible.  No one else remembers Doral's?  Doral's had these filters on them and they were plastic and they had like a hinge and a  clip.  So it used to dissect the cigarette.  And as a kid, I was like opening it up and making believe it was a space capsule and  shit.  Yeah.  It was just fucking great.  I was a psychopath.  They say there's a fine line between genius and douche.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Yeah, but then you say, remember Doral's?  No one else remembers.  There might be like five other guys out there. 
[00:53:30]  I don't remember those.  I don't know.  I don't remember those.  Do you remember cigarette ads at all?  I do, yeah.  Marlboro Man.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember those.  I'm sorry.  I just poked them with my finger.  I don't remember.  I don't remember the ads on TV, though.  I don't think I remember them on TV.  Oh, yeah.  They were on.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  They were on.  Yeah, and they were cool, you know?  Yeah.  Especially the ones that marketed to like teenagers and young adults.  Yes.  They knew what they were doing.  They were really cool.  They knew what they were doing.  Kids were partying and smoking.  Yes.  It was awesome.  Cartoon characters. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  You looked badass smoking cigarettes if you were watching that commercial and thought  that.  Now, if you look at kids that are smoking, it looks ridiculous.  It looks so retarded.  It does, right?  Yeah.  They're sitting there, and they don't really know how to hold it or when to take a drag.  You think we knew how to hold it properly?  No.  We looked ridiculous, too.  Of course.  You know, what are you going to do, though?  Of course.  You've got to go through that phase.  I want to ask Elijah about The Hobbit, man.  Me and Jimmy saw it.  We loved it.  I know you were only in it for a couple... 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  How long?  Like maybe five minutes?  Five minutes, something like that, yeah.  Yeah, the beginning, which was kind of cool, because it was kind of like, oh, I remember  that from, you know, Lord of the Rings.  That's when he leaves to go and meet Gandalf to take a little ride.  That's the cool thing.  It's literally like 15 or 20 minutes before that first scene in the first movie.  It was awesome.  Did you like it, The Hobbit?  Yeah, I loved it.  It's amazing.  I loved it, man.  And you know what it was also?  It was like with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, watching each one.  And after The Hobbit, right when the end comes, you're like, oh, fuck, it's a trilogy! 
[00:55:00]  That's right!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  God damn it!  How long do I have to wait?  I know.  Yeah, you get like the dragon little eye opens and you're like...  Just when things are kicking ass.  Oh, man.  The eyelid.  Yeah, yeah.  Now we've got to wait a year?  It's about a year, right?  It's a year, yeah.  It's a year.  So it'll be December this year.  Solid.  All right, we're getting there.  Solid year, yeah.  Well, they're done with it, right?  We're about halfway through.  They're done making it.  No, well, they shot all of it at the same time, same thing that we did for Rings, but  then they, midway through the editing process of the first one, they realized that they had 
[00:55:30]  to split it into three films.  So they had to go back and shoot additional footage for the third film and I think a bit  for the second, which we did on Rings.  We continued to shoot even after the fact, because they would basically have the luxury  of looking at a cut, see what's missing, see what isn't working, and then add new stuff.  Was there instances where technology itself would kind of advance and then you'd be  like, well, now we've got to do that over again or, you know, we've got to at least 
[00:56:00]  put it in post-production in some way, shape, or form?  I think that did happen.  I think initially, actually during the film, they were taking, they were shooting footage  of fire for the purpose of using that and to digitize that.  Over the course of the shooting, they wrote the program for fire.  Okay.  Like a better program for fire.  So it's better fire than fire.  That happened along the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Watching the documentary, all the footage that came with the DVDs and everything, you 
[00:56:30]  could get lost in those documentaries.  Totally.  I spent weeks watching those things.  And you realize how at the forefront of that technology, Peter and all the people involved  in it is.  It still rolls up.  It's amazing.  Oh, yeah.  It looks great.  It doesn't look at us.  Yeah.  And now you've got a movie also, Maniac?  Yeah.  And this is a remake of a movie from...  1980 film.  80s.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  And it's a little dark.  Yeah.  Just a little.  It's a tad dark.  Yeah.  It's basically about a serial killer.  It's about a guy who stalks women and kills them and keeps their scalps on mannequins.  It is honestly the weirdest film I've ever jerked off to.  But I got to tell you, there's a...  But you did it on vacation.  That's true.  But there was scalping in it.  And there was one in particular...  They're all really fucking graphic. 
[00:57:30]  But there's one in particular where it just...  It violated me.  Like it was...  And I'm saying that in a good way.  It was really uncomfortable to watch.  And gore movies don't ever freak me out.  But there was one where it's like, he's really fucking scalping this woman.  And you know he's not.  But it was...  Which one was it?  I want to say it was the second one.  Not the...  The girl in her apartment.  The young girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it was...  It was something about the way they shot it with the straight razor. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  I think that was the second one.  Yeah.  That's brutal.  And you could hear it.  You could hear it.  Crunchy.  And you could see it being lifted off kind of like almost like a moving head.  And it was just...  The sound design on that.  It was really brutal.  Horrendous.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You play an absolute fucking creep.  Yes.  Yes.  With dirty fucking...  I'm like, why do chicks want to bang him?  His fingers and hands were dirty.  Red knuckles.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Even his hands are creepy.  So, yeah.  There was some really, really great gore in that. 
[00:58:30]  I quite enjoyed that.  You normally play likable guys.  For the most part, I suppose.  For the most part.  Yeah.  So that's continued.  Anything different you had to do?  Suck yourself up or is it pretty much, hey, here's my part?  Well, this was an interesting role because it was largely not on camera.  The movie is actually in a mostly POV.  About 80% of the film is in POV.  Was that the way the 1980 movie was too?  No.  Oh, okay.  This was just...  No, which is partly why I wanted to do this because I don't love remakes, specifically 
[00:59:00]  movies that don't do anything different or don't have a perspective that's unique.  So the fact that they wanted to shoot this in POV and that the killer would only really  be seen in reflections was really exciting.  So therefore, the approach is a little bit different.  It was kind of largely technical on set except for those very specific character moments  where you see the character.  Right.  And then a lot of it was re-recorded, like all the dialogue we re-recorded, and I felt  like the real character work happened there because it's all of the stuff of a sense of 
[00:59:30]  presence, his own inner dialogue, and I was able to kind of work with the nuances of what  the character was.  It was a lot of fun.  There was a couple of moments where they do it where all of a sudden the camera's just  looking at you in the parking lot, and it was like, I wonder why they did that.  I didn't mind it, but I was like wondering what...  The idea behind that was this notion that people talk about having out-of-body experiences.  Some serial killers have referred to that.  So it was kind of a nod to that and a way to see the character do those sort of heinous 
[01:00:00]  things.  And there was a great Achilles slash.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  That's one of the most brutal things in the movie.  Those are terrible in movies.  There's been a couple of them.  Yeah.  Pet Sematary is a good one, too.  So, where old Herman Munster got...  Herman Munster.  But this is a brutal one, and she's wearing heels, which is just perfect for an Achilles  slash, and it's a gash.  The way it was shot and those scenes were really, really well done.  It's very difficult to make me cringe watching a movie physically. 
[01:00:30]  But I've seen real live things, I think a live leak or whatever, that are worse, and  these were really fucking horrible.  I think what's interesting, too, is that as an audience member, to a certain degree, you're  kind of complicit in what this guy's doing, because you're looking at everything through  his eyes.  You're in it, yeah.  And that was exciting to me.  The idea that you'd be made to feel a little bit uncomfortable.  Yeah.  You know?  You also...  And plus, seeing you do it, and knowing it was you, and then seeing your reflection,  it was...  Again, it was a very out of character.  Even though you're playing a character, everybody knows you, and it's... 
[01:01:00]  It was definitely odd to see.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it was nice.  Cool.  I love to see guys doing that.  I always wish Eddie Murphy had played a rapist or a murderer, because he...  He's a good actor.  That does sound a little odd.  No, but you know what I mean?  Because Eddie's a really good actor, but he's always playing the same likable dude.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you know, you always enjoy him, and he's great.  Yeah, he's great at what he does.  But he's a talented...  Like, Pryor played, you know, different serious roles.  I wish Murphy would have done that, because I think it would have been a tremendous shock 
[01:01:30]  to the system.  Yeah, I mean, I think as an actor, it's...  I certainly can only operate this way, that I have to do things that are different than  things I've done before.  I just have to continue to challenge myself, and also, by doing other things that people  aren't as familiar with in regards to what you've done before, it also just helps to  create more opportunities to continue to expand.  Yeah, there is that word, comic actor, that if sometimes people have tried to go from 
[01:02:00]  that to serious acting, and they've literally been laughed at.  I thought Jim Carrey has made a couple of great jobs.  Jim Carrey did a pretty good job at doing that.  Robin Williams, of course.  Yeah, well, he's a fucking...  Yeah, Robin Williams.  He's really good at serious acting as well.  Adam Sandler, not so much.  But has he tried?  However, Punch Drunk Love...  Yeah, yeah.  His performance in Punch Drunk Love was phenomenal.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  I might have to give you that one.  It's great.  Yeah.  I kind of like the one where he has his twin sister. 
[01:02:30]  That was serious, right?  What was that film called?  Jack and Jill.  Jack and Jill.  Well, yikes.  That was uncomfortable.  The trailer was uncomfortable to watch, even.  Well, it wasn't funny, so if he was acting, it wasn't as a comic actor.  It's a big jump time.  All right, he had one.  Yeah, it's got to be.  All right, he had a bomb.  He had one bomb.  Please.  All right.  He's blown us off, so you can see where this is coming from.  Oh, no, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened? 
[01:03:00]  He's made for our show.  What were the seeds of discontent?  No reason.  He used to call our show here and there, but no reason.  We're perfect for...  We just get our feelings hurt.  We really do.  Like, Adam Sandler flew you guys off, and I'm here?  Jesus Christ.  I'm leaving.  Dude, as we're walking into the studio, I was like, man, I come here every year for  Wilfred.  It's kind of awesome.  Yeah, that's great.  I love it.  It's a great show, too.  TV interviews are so weird, too, because here, you're good on this show because it's  a free-form chat.  Yeah.  But a lot of guys come in, actors, or musicians or whatever, and they don't know how to do 
[01:03:30]  more than seven minutes because they're so used to a quick character discussion.  Well, it's about this, and how was it?  But, oh, the crew was a hoot.  You know, boom, boom, boom.  It's out there.  And they don't know how to do, like, a regular...  To actually interact with people and have a normal conversation?  Yeah.  A lot of them don't.  It's really weird, man.  That's funny.  Yeah, it's frustrating.  It's conditioning, I think, probably.  You know, you just get conditioned to a certain thing, and that's what's expected of you. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  I don't know.  I find it more comfortable to have a real conversation, because sometimes those, like,  late-night talk shows, they can be great, but there's also, like, a format.  You know, you have a pre-interview, you actually get, you know, the segment producer comes up  to you and says, so this is what we're going to talk about.  So you kind of have to, like, fit within these parameters.  Yeah.  And I like when that gets thrown away, and you can actually just have a genuine interaction.  There's much less pressure associated with that.  I think some of the most classic moments on those talk shows are when the script went  out the window, and they got off on a tangent, and they have a real moment and a real conversation, 
[01:04:30]  and those end up on the highlight reels and everything else.  So, yeah.  Fallon's really good at that.  Yeah, yeah.  I feel like every time I'm on Fallon's show, I have a real conversation.  Yeah, yeah.  We just go off on a tangent, and it's wonderful.  He's great.  He's awesome.  I love Fallon.  I'm nervous about the Tonight Show, though.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I love him so much, and I'm so excited for the opportunity, because it's a huge opportunity.  But I love what he's so created an amazing niche for himself with his show, and I feel 
[01:05:00]  like he's really defined what that show is.  And my concern is that what that other show needs, because of the time slot, because of  the history that that name has associated with it, and the audience that watches that show  is so different than what the people that watch Fallon's show.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm glad they're keeping it in New York.  I feel like that'll help continue to...  That'll be different, because we haven't seen that in many, many years, obviously.  Yeah.  I get what you're saying.  He'll have to go a little more mainstream with his bits and stuff. 
[01:05:30]  I worry.  They maintain that they're not going to, and I'm sure it'll be an awesome show, but  I love what he's done.  You've been doing interviews and stuff forever, for years, your whole life.  I mean, starting as a very young actor, when you were put in that situation where you would  have to sit down and conduct an interview as a child, thinking back on that now, do you  go like, boy, I really handled myself well, or are you like, oh boy, I'm just a dopey  kid out there? 
[01:06:00]  How do you see yourself as a child, having been put in that situation?  Do you think you did a good job?  I haven't watched any of those interviews in a long time.  Really?  My memory is that I handled it pretty well.  Yeah.  I actually remember being on David Letterman's show, and I knew going into it that David was  kind of petrified with kids on the show.  Really?  Because he was worried that they wouldn't talk.  Right, right.  You know?  So he ended up driving the conversation, and I remember he asked me a couple questions, 
[01:06:30]  and I just started to answer, and he kind of cut me off and started, because he just wanted  to keep it going.  Yeah.  And I stopped him, and I was like, man, you cut me off.  And I was like, I don't know, maybe 12 or 13 or something.  Wow.  And it was pretty great.  Like, I just remember actually having a genuine banter with him.  The audience must have lost it at that point.  It was pretty funny.  He probably liked it, too.  Letterman probably liked it, too.  He probably liked the little stem.  I think he did.  I think he did.  My memory is that he did.  Yeah.  I was on the Arsenio Hall show, too. 
[01:07:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Way back.  That is going back.  How old were you then, do you think?  Man.  I think I was probably 10 or 11.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'd have to go back and look at him.  The radio flyer days or something.  Around that time.  Yeah.  What year is that?  1991.  92.  Did you ever do Carson?  I did.  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  That's nice, man.  It's not even that old.  No, that's what I'm saying.  It's a great one.  To have done Carson.  I think I did Craig Kilbourne, too. 
[01:07:30]  Wow.  Remember him from the original host of The Daily Show?  Yes.  Wow, that's right.  Then he spawned his own show for a while that didn't really go anywhere.  And then Jon Stewart did something with The Daily Show.  Yeah.  Came from MTV.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He stepped into something over there.  It's kind of amazing because it almost erased the memory of what that show was.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  It's so established that it's something else.  And Fallon, I think Fallon will do well because he's different than Kimmel.  Like, Fallon is truer in his nature to what The Tonight Show is than probably what Kimmel 
[01:08:00]  does or what Letterman does.  I think Kimmel and Letterman might be more similar and Fallon and Leno might be more similar.  I think you're right.  So, um...  Yeah.  I think universally, I think Fallon's more acceptable to the American public.  People like him a lot, man.  He's very fresh-faced, nice kind of...  I love him.  Yeah.  He's not doing anything on there that anyone would really find offensive.  No.  And there's a goodness to him.  He connects with everybody.  He doesn't have a bad bone in his body. 
[01:08:30]  Not a genuinely nice guy.  He's one of the most enthusiastic dudes I've ever met.  Right?  Yeah.  He's so psyched.  He's so psyched.  All the time.  So psyched.  It's great.  And it's coming...  It's so genuine, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's awesome.  It's hard to have...  I've only done his show once.  But it's like, you can't have a bad interview with him because...  I know he just probably jinxed my next appearance.  He's fucking a bomb.  Death.  But I'm doing it tonight.  Oh, you are?  Okay.  He does have such enthusiasm and he's a fun guy.  It's like he wants it to go well. 
[01:09:00]  And they all do, but he's not jaded at all.  And he's not going to leave you hanging.  He was a very fun guy.  He said, just come on the show sometime.  And I was like, I never follow up because people are just being polite.  But the next time I saw him, he's like, how come you haven't come on the show?  I really wanted you to come on.  He was being very genuine.  So I was like, immediately.  And I just...  What's your cell number?  And I just...  It became, what about Bob?  I just hassled him.  And begged.  You said you wanted me on your show.  Yeah.  Hey, give me a...  Just following up about the show. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  I handed him a card.  He's my pride and joy.  Oh, yeah.  Rupert Pupkin.  Yeah.  Marvel.  The Worst of the Week Countdown.  On the OPN Equity Channel.  Sirius XM.  A download.

It's the worst of the week countdown where we highlight the great moments that happened,  the greatest moments, really, that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony Show with me,  Sam Roberts from ONA and after ONA Live. 
[01:14:00]  It was a big, big week.  Amy Schumer was on the show.  Tony Soprano called in from beyond the grave.  Ricky Gervais, one of the funniest people on the planet, was in studio.  I'll get to all that soon.  First, Joe Piscopo has developed a very strange relationship with this show.  I mean, we trash him.  We make fun of him.  We fuck with his livelihood, but yet he keeps coming back.  He called in.  I guess it was his birthday, and so we took that opportunity to make a fool of him again. 
[01:14:30]  Poor guy.  I hope we can get a Joe Piscopo dating game happening.  Joe Piscopo, one of my favorite people in the world, on the phone.  On the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Number five.  Yeah.  Who am I?  Who am I?  Hey!  Hey, Joe.  How are you, buddy?  Happy birthday, Joe.  You guys are the best.  Yes. 
[01:15:00]  I swear to God, I all hear the great things since we've been on.  I hear the nicest things from the craziest people, how much they enjoyed our show.  Oh, yeah.  Here you go.  You call to wish your old Jersey guy a happy birthday.  That's absolutely right.  We saw Jersey Joe Piscopo's birthday today, and we figured, you know what?  You've been so much fun here on the program.  We had to give a call.  Say hi.  And, Joe, you know what?  We're not those type of guys.  We're not even saying your age.  No.  Because you're ageless. 
[01:15:30]  You're ageless, Joe.  You know what?  Because you know that the young chick's listening.  Ah, that's right.  Joe, Joe, Mike.  We don't know if Joe's shaving a few years off when he talks to these guys.  No idea.  No idea.  We don't want to blow up your spot, Joe.  Exactly.  No, you know what?  I don't even go there anymore.  You know?  It's like the answer is, what does it matter?  You know?  What does it matter?  Is that it?  Age is just a number.  You know what?  But, hey, you've got some nice girls that have contacted me that listen to the show, boys. 
[01:16:00]  Very good.  Ah, there it is.  Going to Jimmy's point.  Joe's diluting our fucking opportunities here.  Oh, man.  I'm here.  It's so funny.  The dichotomy of my life.  Yeah.  And Anthony.  And I'm here with the kids.  I'm running.  I'm going to get the other kids.  I'm running around.  And it seems it's over here in this, you know, bucolic setting of western Jersey.  And then Roland texts me, oh, and Anthony, I want to talk to you.  It's just like a whole dichotomy of that. 
[01:16:30]  It's amazing.  It makes it exciting.  A lot going on.  You still live in Jersey, Joe?  You know what?  I ain't moving, baby.  Come on now.  You know that.  Yeah, we know you love that Jersey.  He's a Jersey guy.  Always will be.  We noticed that you tweeted yesterday, happy Father's Day, you know?  You know, hey, hey, happy Father's Day.  He said, the problem is I have to stop at every exit along the parkway.  Ah, because you really banged a lot of broads.  Joe.  Up and down the turnpike, right, Joe?  What exit?  Hey, hey. 
[01:17:00]  Which exits you got covered for broads?  Joe, it's called pulling out.  You ought to look into it.  Stop.  I got, I got.  The only one.  I'm naming my children after the exits.  Oh, fuck.  That's hilarious.  Jeez.  Yes, Father's Day was yesterday, and we saw your tweet about it, and it was a little vague.  Wait a minute.  Which one did you?  Well, you were talking about the kids.  What's the age range of all the kids at this point? 
[01:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Joe is like 67 and retired.  You know the line.  I mean, it's like, yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  I got an older son.  Joe is like in his 30s, and then I got the, I have the two-and-a-half-year-old, which we talked about on the air,  which the baby mama got, like, ticked off because I talked about it on the air with you guys.  No, it was, I was, I said, I said, honey, that's funny.  It's funny stuff.  You remember when I didn't know it was my baby?  We did that whole piece.  And then she's going, oh, that's too, that's too personal.  I went, no, man, that's funny stuff.  That was funny, you know?  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  And I'll tell you, boys, I will probably say right here on the opening of the Anthony show, ladies and Joe,  I don't think I'm done yet.  I don't think I'm done yet.  Whoa, Joe.  Come on now.  Come on.  You don't think you're done yet with maybe having some kids?  If I meet a girl that takes care of me, that cares enough, that doesn't just use me, you know?  Why is he blowing snot up into these wings?  You can enjoy a girl without knocking her up. 
[01:18:30]  Right.  Don't you understand that?  No, they all want babies.  No, Joe.  No, no.  You know what?  Wow.  That's so much money going to these women and child support.  Joe, you just got to have.  I did.  I said, and by the time your father, I did tweet one tweet, you know, from my cynical friends.  I said, you know, if you're blamed and you're belittled and you're broke, I said, happy Father's Day.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah. 
[01:19:00]  It's the same thing.  It's like, you know, but I can't meet.  And maybe we, you know what we should have, guys, if I may?  And I feel I know you're long enough to propose this.  Sure.  We should have a symposium.  A symposium for Jersey Joe, old Joe.  And maybe there's a girl out there.  She just wants to have a nice relationship.  We'll do like, you know, opiumanthony.com.  Uh-huh.  I love that Joe's a horn dog.  What happened to the mom of the two and a half year old?  Are you still with her?  Who's that now?  Who's that? 
[01:19:30]  What happened to the mom of the two and a half year old?  Well, yeah, I got to come in and we got to talk.  Joe.  We got to talk.  We got to talk.  What are you going to do?  All right, Joe.  Listen, I'm the Henry Kissinger of young broads.  You know, I keep the peace.  You know what I'm saying?  But I just, I don't know.  I got to settle in because everybody wants to get married.  This is a lot of angst.  Yesterday, guys, there were no exes. 
[01:20:00]  There were no girlfriends.  There was nothing.  It was just my children.  Best freaking day ever.  Nice.  Good for Joe Piscopo.  That's what it's all about.  Right, Joe?  I did.  Baby, it's the kids.  It's all about the kids.  You know that.  How many kids you got now?  Five.  Five.  Wow.  Five kids.  And he's not done.  Yeah, no, I don't think I am, but I don't know how much.  How many do you got, Anthony?  How many do you have?  None.  None, Joe.  I thought you knew us, Joe.  The second.  I thought you knew us. 
[01:20:30]  The second that feeling that resembles a sneeze comes up, I pull my dick out.  And spray.  That's what I do.  It's a sprayer.  I pull it out.  Yeah.  And fucking just let the old sheets and mattress soak it up.  Okay, I got what you're going to do.  I've never had to pay child support to fucking posturepedic.  Absolutely.  There's nothing better than the look on her face when you're laying there and she has  to get up and go towel off.  See that stuff that was supposed to give life?  Go wipe it off in the bathroom. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm glad you're not being graphic about it.  Yeah, well, we try to use double entendre.  Yes, we're good at that.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Joe.  I shake a plate.  It's all good.  We do.  And since I was like, you guys, we've been working.  I'm telling you, and I just comment people come to me.  Oh, yeah.  We knock it out.  So it's all good.  So listen, I never think we have fun.  You make fun.  We do.  We schmooze.  But I tell you what, guys, I appreciate it. 
[01:21:30]  And I appreciate the friendship very much.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  I think this is a terrific friendship.  You're fantastic.  And what do you got coming up?  You got anything to plug?  Any shows coming up?  No, I'm going out of business.  I'm just going to forget about it because, you know, when I go to court, I want to just  bring my pockets.  Oh.  The court thing again.  You are in court like you're always in court.  You're always got some young broad knocked up.  Joe, think of what a smooth ride you'd have had if you just didn't keep it in that long. 
[01:22:00]  That's it.  That's it.  You know what?  His whole life is getting broads pregnant and going to court.  It's unbelievable.  And I bet it's very romantic.  I bet there's a loving look in the eyes when you know that you're conceiving a new life  and everything.  You just got to stop that, Joe.  Come on now.  This is like therapy for me.  It is.  Yeah, Joe.  It is.  This is well needed.  It's like an intervention.  It's an intervention for you. 
[01:22:30]  Intervention.  That's what it is.  You know how therapeutic it was for me.  Oh, oh, I didn't even tell you guys.  Oh, yeah.  Well, listen.  So we go on the air.  I'm absolutely, you know, I was off the wall, like, ticked off, man.  And then, you know, because they disrespected me.  They said bad things in the paper.  You guys, and they go, it's opening it.  They said, and why I always appreciate what you do is you got millions of listeners.  I go on the air, and I answer this freaking crack back.  You know who bled to the paper?  It was the ex-wife's boyfriend who bled to the paper. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Of course.  Unbelievable.  But listen, you know, you guys know, and I make all the fun you want, I know, but you  know, it's like how hard I work, how dedicated I am, you know, about the whole family thing.  And, you know, all right, I make a couple wrong moves, but I'm always working.  I'm taking care of the kids.  It's just the bum of the ex-wife, the bum that I'm paying for, the guy that's living  in the freaking house, the guy that I'm paying for, that's just the car that's driving that  I'm paying for, he's going to call the press, and he's going to say bad things, and hope 
[01:23:30]  me if freaking Anthony allow me to answer it.  Of course, Joe, that's what friends do.  I heard about it in court, I'll tell you that.  Oh, did you?  Are you done with that court case?  I hope so.  You know what?  It's all good.  It's all good.  Oh, that means no.  Oh, Joe.  That means a few more years of suffering.  No, if it doesn't work, can I call you?  Of course, Joe.  Hey, Joe, what are you doing for your birthday? 
[01:24:00]  Anything fun today?  I got all the kids.  You know what?  I'm just going to stay home.  Tomorrow's the last day of school.  I don't want to say nothing, but, you know, I'm one of those dads that take the kids to school,  very dedicated, and I'm so tired of homework and snacks.  And extracurricular activity.  I just want to hang in today, man.  I'm just going to hang and just have fun with all my children.  They're going to be there.  Right.  Let me tell you.  You know?  And I'm just going to hang out.  Promise us one thing, Joe. 
[01:24:30]  Promise us one thing.  That you keep your dick dry today.  Yeah, just today.  Just today.  Try today to keep it dry.  And then we'll work on tomorrow.  Right.  All right?  We'll go day to day.  It's kind of like a...  We're going to have an intervention.  Yeah, yeah.  One day at a time.  Try to keep your dick dry.  One day at a time.  Because we hate to see you suffer.  Fucking Joe loves coming deep.  Oh, yeah.  He's a good boy.  Yeah.  He does.  He does like that. 
[01:25:00]  I get it.  It's hard to put it on.  Oh, it is.  It takes a certain amount of discipline.  You are right.  Right about that one.  Guys, the problem is I am a Monopolitanic fall in love.  That is my problem right there, Joe.  I fall in freaking love.  And I do it.  And then you write a song.  Oh, Jesus.  We remember the song.  You remember the song, right?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  He goes, uh-oh.  You have any more songs in your future?  That's all we need to know, Joe. 
[01:25:30]  Any more songs in your future?  No, my God.  I won't be that much in love.  I can promise you.  Oh, thank God.  That's too much.  That's too much love.  There's such a thing as too much love.  And when you start writing songs like that, yeah, that's too much love.  Hey, Joe, you would...  What do you want me to write?  I could write a new one and perform it in the studio next time.  That would be wonderful.  I would actually love that.  We're actually big fans of the Jersey song.  Yeah, that one was good, too.  We like that one a lot.  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  That's the one.  That's my answer.  That's the answer, man.  No kidding, man.  Did Bruce ever call you after that song came out?  Yeah.  No, he was...  I thought he was.  He's a Jersey guy.  He is.  Early on, I remember I did the Stringstein impression.  Right.  And we did a song called New Jersey off the New Jersey album.  I think Abe Lincoln was president.  It was like long.  Oh.  But Bruce...  But listen, Bruce said...  Ship up.  He loved it.  He loved it.  Really?  Dave Marsh told me he really dug it.  So I'll tell you what. 
[01:26:30]  He's the king.  He's the king.  So that was my answer.  Oh, he is.  Yeah, yeah.  Joe, I know it's your birthday, and you probably don't want to perform on your birthday especially,  but can we hear the Stringstein?  Just even a little taste?  Just a little.  I know you're in the car, and you're dropping off the kids, and you're going to get your dick  wet in about an hour or two, and then go to court.  But you know, something told me to leave the kids off before I called in.  I know.  When you drop the kids off at school, do you leave with just as many kids in the car? 
[01:27:00]  Of course of age, Joe.  Of age.  Of course.  Look at him.  You're not, you know, doing anything illegal.  No.  Would you guys like to hear the Stringstein?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Would you like to hear the Stringstein?  Oh, yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, Joe Piscopo as Bruce Springsteen.  I can't.  No, no, no.  Because I know it's going to happen.  We're going to do it, and I don't have the material of the guitar.  I'll come get it up to it.  It'll sound good.  I think it'll sound terrific.  Yeah, let's do it.  Yeah. 
[01:27:30]  What the fuck?  I think we all understand that you're in the car, you know, and it's not the perfect situation.  Yeah, yeah.  We're jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive.  Yeah, you just do that, you know.  You see what happened?  No, no, no, no.  See, Ant's just fucking, uh...  Yeah, you just got to belt it out.  What the fudge?  All right, here we go.  Joe Piscopo.  Joe Piscopo.  And then you guys are going to leave me hanging, right?  No, no, no.  No, no.  Joe, you're a friend.  It's your birthday, my God. 
[01:28:00]  It's your birthday.  Why do I feel like Buddy Epson right now?  I'm not sure what...  Well, dogey.  All right, here we go.  Joe Piscopo, live from the car in.  Yeah.  As he drops his kids off at school.  A little taste to Bruce.  My theme song.  You guys aren't going to let me up the hook on this, right?  All right.  Just let it rip.  You know, sometimes it's easier...  Fuckin' cold for it.  Sometimes it's easier to just belt it out, Joe.  Fuck yeah.  No, but I like Bruce when he's in his seductive mode.  All right.  Oh, all right.  Okay, good.  Yeah, little girl, is your daddy home? 
[01:28:30]  Did he go and leave you all alone?  I got a bad desire.  It's my theme song, by the way.  Ooh, homo, fuck.  There it is.  How's that?  Good, guys?  You're not bad, right?  Okay, hanging.  Hanging.  You son of a gun.  Here I am.  Leave it on the air.  Leave it on the air.  Check out JoePiscobo.com.  And you know what?

And stay with the intervention, because I think it's working.

Worst of the Week countdown, highlighting all the great moments that happened on the Opie and Anthony show this week with me, Sam Roberts,  the in-studio official for Opie and Anthony, as well as the host of After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[01:35:00]  We've got a lot happening this week, and we'll get to all of it.  Still to come, Tony Soprano calling in from beyond the grave.  Amy Schumer.  Ricky Gervais.  But, you know, we were talking about Joe Piscopo earlier and how he gets trashed, but he calls in,  and he knows it because we're joking and it's all good.  Busting balls.  Busting balls.  Sometimes we trash people without realizing that they listen,  as was the case with SNL cast member Bobby Moynihan. 
[01:35:30]  Bobby was up here doing interviews.  I got to interview him, and I found out as I was interviewing him,  he's a big O&A fan,  and that he had found a bit on YouTube while searching for Opie and Anthony bits  that surrounded, that was based around his character of the drunk uncle that he does on Saturday Night Live.  It wasn't positive.  I told O&A about it.  They reacted.  Like this. 
[01:36:00]  This show is known for putting its foot in its mouth, and we did it again.  No, we didn't.  Dicks, whatever.  Exactly.  Our mouths are open fucking holes.  Put in whatever garbage you have.  We did it again, though.  I always feel bad when a person is a fan of the show or knows a...  Well, we don't know him.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Sam related a story to us right before the show today.  Yeah.  I kind of feel bad.  What was the story?  Just because he's...  Supposedly he is or was a huge fan of our radio show. 
[01:36:30]  Still is.  Yes.  One of the guys at SNL is a huge fan of the Opie and Anthony show.  Not one of the guys.  Hold on.  But before the big reveal...  Sure.  There are times where people go, oh, I'm a big fan of you guys.  And then you ask a couple questions innocently, and you realize that they're just saying that.  It's bullshit.  When I finished talking to this person...  You had no doubt he's a big fan.  I said, nice to meet you.  And he said, it's great to put a face with the voice.  Oh, no.  With your voice?  My voice. 
[01:37:00]  So he's a fan of yours, too.  He's a big fan.  It'd be nice to put something interesting with the voice.  Before the big reveal, what made him a big fan?  What were some of the things he told you?  Well, this person...  He's a performer, obviously.  And he's been a fan for a long time.  Okay.  Any W days?  Any W days.  Like, his first...  One of his first acting gigs, he played just like a background janitor, and it was with  Richard Graco or something like that. 
[01:37:30]  Ooh.  And...  It's name-dropping.  He skipped it.  He didn't show up to perform because he was listening to the Voyeur Bus.  Oh!  And he couldn't leave his radio.  One of his first acting gigs.  His first acting gig.  Yeah, one of his very early...  That was Frank Vincent.  Bad guest guy.  The Voyeur Bus was very captivating.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Um...  Yeah.  If we pay the million dollars, we could start playing that audio again.  He used to go to your show.  They're holding us up for our fucking tapes.  Oh, God, we gotta play the Voyeur Bus.  A million dollars?  Well, that's what they start at. 
[01:38:00]  I'm like, what are you crazy?  Who has a million dollars laying around?  I do, but I can't spend it on that.  He used to go to your show events.  Yeah?  Do you?  Yeah.  I do.  He used to go to events?  Yep.  He's been to, like, strip clubs.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  To see you guys, uh...  Dance?  Yeah, I didn't know you did that.  No, I thought it was just a show event.  Oh, I mean...  I didn't...  Oh, wow.  Oh, oh.  Before my time, I guess.  Isn't that awkward?  Awkward. 
[01:38:30]  And, yeah, now he recently got Sirius XM back.  And so he's been...  Wait, what about the Ron and Fez one, too, you were telling me?  I'm just hammering this home.  He's a huge Ron and Fez fan, as well.  He's an Opie and Anthony Ron and Fez fan.  Oh, man.  Right.  He approached Ron on the street years ago.  Hours of entertainment right here on one channel.  All excited.  To say, hey, Ron, wow.  Holy fuck, that's Ron.  Ron Bankton.  I'm a big fan, blah, blah, blah.  Okay.  Wow.  Before anybody knew who he was.  Now...  What did Ron say?  With his headphones on, just fist bump him?  Hey, buddy.  Keep walking. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, buddy.  Hey, thanks.  Appreciate it.  Now he's got Sirius XM back, he said.  But he's been, like, in the meantime, going on YouTube and going to YouTube to search Opie and Anthony bits.  Oh, boy.  Listen to a couple of the clips.  Listen to some clips.  And then what happened?  He found his name in one of the clips.  Oh, no.  And said, I gotta hear this.  My fucking hands.  Oh, no.  He's a blunder on his part to click that link, though. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  He got excited, like, holy fuck, I'm a fan of these guys.  And they're obviously a fan of mine.  Yeah, because they're talking about me.  Unfortunately, you were not talking about him kindly in the clip that he listened to.  And it was a long clip.  Oh.  I believe it was about an hour that day.  Probably.  A good hour beating.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he wasn't, by the way, searching for himself.  He was searching for you guys.  Uh-huh.  Just to have a laugh.  And then got excited, like, holy fuck, they talked about me. 
[01:40:00]  This is amazing.  This is amazing.  This is like a childhood dream come true.  And then he had to hear us bash him for an hour?  That's about right, yeah.  Oh.  And he was in here yesterday?  He was up, yeah, yesterday afternoon.  Uh-huh.  And you talked to him?  I did.  I got to interview him.  But how did that come about?  I just had an interview scheduled with him.  Oh, okay.  It's Drunken Uncle.  Yeah.  I don't even know his real name.  Bobby Moynihan.  Bobby Moynihan. 
[01:40:30]  Bobby Moynihan.  He's huge on SNL.  He's been there a while now.  He's a staple on SNL.  He's going into his sixth season on the show.  Uh-huh.  And I guess the bit was, it was at one of those benefits, right?  It was at 12th.  There was a picture of him.  And the garden.  It was out of context.  Was it the Sandy Relief concert?  Yeah.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  12th, 12th concert.  And he went up there with who?  Seth McFarlane.  Yeah, it was Seth.  I'm sorry, Seth Meyer.  Seth Meyer, yeah, sorry, yeah.  So Seth Meyer and him did Drunken Uncle in front of a live audience at Madison Square Garden. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, on stage.  And it bombed.  It went over like a fucking strong breeze.  See, because it was Sandy Relief.  Yes.  And we had to point out how bad it was.  He followed Kanye West, who also completely took the crowd out of the show.  Kanye West stunk that night.  I think that probably hurt these guys.  But, you know, look, it wasn't a great bit.  And it might be a funny bit on SNL, but in that particular...  It didn't work.  It's hard when you're scripted like that to have to be married to it.  Yeah. 
[01:41:30]  What did we say?  We weren't that bad.  No, you were horrible.  Yeah, really mean.  Really?  Very mean.  Really?  Yeah.  Yes, you were.  It's always hard when you're mean to somebody who likes you.  Yeah, prove that we were mean.  Yeah, what are you talking about?  We're here a little bit.  You liar.  Billy Joe was on, but the genius that was SNL's drunk uncle, Anthony, came on right after  Kanye.  Anthony.  Wow.  Whew.  SNL should be embarrassed.  I would tell Anthony before the show, I'm like...  Opie. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, this is uncomfortable.  Can I point out that this is not even lighthearted ribbing?  No, no.  This is just terrible.  Like, Opie...  Oh, I feel really bad now.  I am mad.  Like, what the fuck was that?  I remember trying to call these guys off and stop the bit, and they wouldn't.  Maybe I just keep playing some more.  Oh, this is so terrible.  Yeah.  And this guy...  And he's a fan of ours, for real.  Not the guy next to Drunk Uncle.  Right.  Drunk Uncle himself is a huge Opie and Anthony fan.  Okay.  Oh, man.  He was. 
[01:42:30]  He was.  Our guys came to us and said, hey, man, we got this bit that's called Drunk Uncle.  The person would be fired.  It's like, what?  It's just a goofy radio show.  That's harsh.  Shit.  That was in front of two billion people last night.  Every so often, I had to remember.  Yeah, I had to remember every so often.  It's like, oh, yeah, this is going out to the world.  Right.  Every channel is showing it.  Right.  And it just makes me feel like, you know what?  You see how I try to chime in and just give facts?  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  Come on, guys.  Every channel is showing it.  Like, let's...  Yeah, you're trying to move on.  Yeah, quit mucking up the works.  All right.  Stick to the news here.  Yes. 
[01:43:00]  We could be on SNL.  Could do that.  You know what?  The person listening to our voices right now, you could be on SNL.  They should be on a...  Yeah.  It turns out the guy is on SNL.  Yeah.  Whoops.  That last night.  Maybe they should be on a Jimmy's piss.  Yeah, that would be the time for it.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I don't watch SNL anymore, so what?  Is that one of their benchmark characters?  Because that was...  I don't either.  Terrible.  Terrible.  I mean, everyone was like, holy fuck, Kanye West is out of place, and his sound didn't sound 
[01:43:30]  right, whatever.  And then he was led off the hook by Drunk Uncle.  Drunk Uncle.  Oh, good.  Oh, you found Drunk Uncle?  Good news.  Oh, boy.  Very good news.  All right.  Who plays Drunk Uncle?  Bobby, I think his last name is Moynihan.  He's one of the...  Oh, no.  He's the new chubby guy on SNL.  Ah, the new fat guy.  You know.  Horatio Sands.  Body fascism.  Oh, my God.  Body fascism.  I didn't realize I jumped in on it a little bit.  This is so bad. 
[01:44:00]  I wouldn't even care, but now knowing he's a fan of ours, I feel bad.  Big fan, like, from childhood.  Now I care.  I feel bad.  When he was just dreaming of making it, and just fighting it, he was like, well, at least  I have my favorite radio show, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, see.  I feel bad.  That's all, though.  We moved on, I'm sure, right?  Yeah, well, I don't really.  This break is just...  Did we move on?  I remember, I kind of liked that bit, and then I'm hearing you guys bash it, and I'm  like, all right, I'm going to walk my position here.  Right, right.  You did not move on.  You sure?  Let's check the clip.  All right.  Didn't he do one of Jimmy's bits? 
[01:44:30]  I think he was doing the...  He did the first Jimmy bit, didn't he?  Which one?  Yeah, the construction site.  Yeah.  Where they're talking to the chicks that are walking by, and they're talking to the  and kind of bad joke guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or bad line guy.  Wasn't he doing...  Pause.  Remember, we had our suspicions.  Oh, no.  Now we have the connection.  We bashed him.  Now we can't accuse him of ripping off Jimmy.  But we had suspicions that this guy ripped off one of Jimmy's bits, and we're like, well,  that's crazy.  We're, you know, we're big-headed.  We're being big-headed that they would even be paying attention to us. 
[01:45:00]  But now it turns out the guy is a fan of the show, so he may have heard Jimmy doing  his thing and maybe kind of...  Oh, now he's being...  Inspired by Jim Norton.  He was inspired.  This break started as us, you know, seeing how nasty we were to him, and now we're going  to accuse him.  Well, in the end, we stick up for Jim Norton.  Because I remember how upset Jimmy was, because one of his bits was absolutely on SNL.  It was twisted and a little different, and we were like, what the fuck? 
[01:45:30]  They've got to be listening to us over there.  Yeah, I've had a couple of chipped bits show up there, and it's very frustrating.  And now it turns out the guy is a fan of our show, so it wasn't as far-fetched as we thought  at the time.  From the Chipperson part?  I thought Daniel Craig was doing the Chipperson part.  I think he was, yeah.  No, he was definitely in the skipper.  I think he was the lead-off guy.  Yeah, but he was the main guy.  Yeah.  Okay.  They've come to accept weak lines as okay in SNL.  Like, really soft.  It doesn't have to be dirty or all edgy, but it seems like they've accepted a lot of weaker 
[01:46:00]  lines than they should.  Yeah.  Like, there's a funnier line you could put there.  Absolutely.  I know it's live TV, and it's fucking once a week, and it's a lot of work, but some of  it, I'm like, what are you guys doing?  It's awful.  Mm-hmm.  What are we listening to?  Very fair criticism by me at that point.  Oh, was it?  And non-specific.  Who knows who you were talking about?  Yeah, they've come.  Who's they?  The powers that be have come to accept weak lines.  Oh.  Meaning, I'm saying that the actors probably have much better ideas.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Specifically Bobby Moynihan. 
[01:46:30]  All I'm doing is imagining him, like, searching this out, or searching out an Opie and Anthony  just a random bit.  He wanted just a fun Opie and Anthony.  And going, like, oh, cool, they're talking about me.  And this is worse than he ever could have expected.  Like, this is a terrible deconstruction of his bit.  Jim went out of his way to say, you cannot blame the audience.  Right, right, right.  Just so he's like, well, the audience really wasn't there.  And then Jim's like, yeah, yeah, you can't blame the audience. 
[01:47:00]  It's the material.  It was bad.  I'll say that now.  It wasn't a particularly, it was a weird thing.  Like, it just, it wasn't meant for Madison Square Enix.  No, no, it wasn't.  No, no, no.  Because it's a bit that you're too married to the diet.  Like, on a stage like that, in that type of atmosphere, I think you have to have a little  more flexibility in what you're doing.  You have to be able to, SNL never breaks the wall.  And I think in a bit like this, you might have had to break the wall and go, this is 
[01:47:30]  really bobbing.  Yeah.  It might have been funny if he had addressed it like that.  Like, this has gone nowhere.  Aren't we just doing it over again?  And now it'll be like, oh, okay, I talked about it.  I addressed it with Sam.  Right.  And, you know, told Sam what big fan I am.  And then now we're just doing it all over again.  All right.  So, yesterday he came in and Sam interviewed him.  That must have been comfortable.  That's when we learned that he was a fan of ours. 
[01:48:00]  And I intended to kind of just ask him how that night went.  Uh-huh.  I had no idea that it was going to be in this context.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  So, here's the audio from yesterday.  Brand new audio with Bobby Moynihan who plays Drunk Uncle.  Thing.  But I didn't know that you were a giant Opie and Anthony guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've been listening for years.  And we were talking and you've heard their take on Drunk Uncle at the 12-12-12.  I think I found it on YouTube.  I was just looking up Opie and Anthony stuff.  I can't do this. 
[01:48:30]  Did you hear the part where you said he's been listening for years?  Years.  Yeah.  Well, like I said earlier, you know, we hear that a lot from celebrities and then you realize  they're just saying that.  I can always just say that.  There's...  It sounds like he's not...  He's 100% telling the truth.  Yeah, yeah.  Looking up Opie and Anthony stuff and saw my name and was like...  It's a pleasure.  Like, you're like, ah, I just like to laugh.  Well, I just got...  I just got serious again.  I hadn't had it for a while.  And then...  Can you pause?  Can I tell you what I hate about Sam in this fucking interview? 
[01:49:00]  Ah.  Sam knows that he's not guilty in this clip of anything.  Yeah.  So he can pretty much just cheerlead and go, so what happened on the clip with Opie and  Anthony?  Because he knows he didn't say anything.  That's the beauty of Sam, though, man.  Troublemaker.  He's not going to hide.  I love it.  No way.  That's what I like about Sam.  He doesn't hide.  Why would he hide?  He didn't say anything.  No.  No, but he...  If you raped somebody, I'd be happy to talk about him.  You're like, ah, I just like to laugh. 
[01:49:30]  Well, I just got serious again.  I hadn't had it for a while.  And then started listening again and got back into it and then was looking up stuff on YouTube  and saw my name and was mortified.  I was like, oh, no.  What have I done?  But they were talking about the...  I did the 12-12-12 concert as Drunk Uncle.  Yeah.  And it did not go very well.  What's it like to go up there?  What's it like to bomb at Madison Square Garden?  Oh, it's the best.  Did you know that was going to happen, though?  The second I walked in the door, I knew it might not have been the best idea. 
[01:50:00]  So you're in the Drunk Uncle outfit.  Standing in the Drunk Uncle outfit.  Chelsea Clinton is standing there.  And you look like an idiot.  Every single rock god is in a room.  And you have makeup on.  And you're holding a fake drink.  It was a wonderful thing to be a part of.  Of course.  But the lasting scar will last forever.  Yeah, I found a video where they were bashing me.  Opie and Anthony were bashing the performance.  And rightfully so.  You found that.  I completely agree with everything they said.  But that was a rough night.  Oh, my God. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, he seems like a good dude.  That really...  But again, he knows...  You have to know...  That's interesting.  Stan, I said, Shelley...  The humiliation of knowing you have to go out.  Like, that's fucking...  Oh, my God.  I don't belong here.  I cut the clip down just for our purposes.  But he also...  I mean, he went on to talk about how the teleprompter just kept going and going.  And he just wanted it to end.  He was watching everybody just stand up and go to the bathroom.  And he said it was horrible.  That's brutal, man.  Did he talk about... 
[01:51:00]  This is what I'd love to ask him.  The moment you finished and walked backstage, like, who did you see?  And walking backstage after a shit performance...  You probably wouldn't make eye contact with anyone.  People just don't look at you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You look down.  Hey, good job.  It's great, man.  Great job.  I'm wondering what people said to him.  Did everybody ignore him?  Did he get a picture with McCartney?  Or was he too ashamed?  Like the scene in Private Parts where Fartman walks back and Ozzy goes,  What a fucking asshole.  Fucking asshole.  I don't remember that. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, that was funny.  Ozzy, isn't it?  Mm-hmm.  Fuck.  Shame on the horse.  Shame on the horse.  Shame on the horse.  Jesus.  That was the shy Howard that comes back.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Hi.  You're fucking asshole.  I bet you a drunk uncle had the same experience.  I'm sure he had.  Very similar to that.  And he told me off the air.  He described it in more detail off the air.  I believe he said he was listening to you guys and wanted to tear his heart out of his chest. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  No.  We got to get him on now.  Oh, we do.  We do.  Now we have to get him on.  Yeah.  Even though we said we would never have him on.  No, you said that.  Oh, I hope that was a good one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, now there's a connection there.  We got to have him on.  Oh, yeah.  When I told him the secret, I was like, you know, those guys will never talk badly about  you again.  If you go on and you say, I heard when you made fun of me, you were right. 
[01:52:30]  Oh.  It's the last time they'll ever say a bad word about you.  That's right.  So I think he, I think we're trying to get him next week or something.  I wouldn't beat him up if he came in.  No way.  No.  No.  Not with everything we've learned here today.  He's a talented guy.  I know what I'd probably say.  Sure.  Looks like you sobered up.  Fucking place will go nuts.  The worst is yet to come.  More of the Opian Anthony worst of the week countdown.  Next.

[01:57:00]  Counting down all the wonderfulness that occurred on the Opie and Anthony show this week with me,  Sam Roberts from ONA and After ONA Live.  This is the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Almost to number one, we'll get to Tony Soprano's post-mortem phone call in a moment.  And Ricky Gervais in studio.  But first, Amy Schumer stopped by.  Always a pleasure to have the wonderful, beautiful, multi-talented Amy Schumer in studio. 
[01:57:30]  She stopped by along with comedian Steve Byrne, who I won't say is beautiful, but also talented.  And just, I don't know, we caught up with him.  It's always a hang with Amy Schumer.  She's always hilarious.  So enjoy Amy Schumer and Steve Byrne.  Number three.  I obviously read Amy's Twitter and stuff like that.  Occasionally, the dick pics subject comes up.  And not a big fan of the dick pics.  Me?  Yeah.  It doesn't do anything. 
[01:58:00]  It doesn't wake up my vagina.  Right, right, right.  I want that inside that.  Not unsolicited.  Now, solicited dick pics.  The girl goes like, oh, I want to see that cock of yours.  Is it power play?  Is it future blackmail stuff?  I think so.  I think it's just a power play.  By a woman?  Like, look, he's sending his dick pic.  What an asshole.  Yeah, I do think that.  Wow.  See, women are not as stimulated about what they see.  They're not that visual.  I love a dick.  Yeah.  Like, come on. 
[01:58:30]  Send him my way.  Save everything else.  No flowers.  Right, right, just dicks.  But to see one never does it for me.  And that's how most girls I know are.  It's what they hear.  Yeah.  You've got to describe it to them.  In a voicemail, I guess.  Yeah.  I like hearing about it.  In a voicemail.  I like hearing about it.  I'll say things.  Telegram.  But yeah, to see a dick pic.  But I like, I'm being more careful now, but it's fun for a girl to send pictures, you 
[01:59:00]  know?  Yeah, now you're in a position, though.  You've got to kind of be a little more careful, right?  There's no way that something's not going to get out there.  Oh, Amy.  Do you have your face in them?  No, don't have your face in them, rookie.  No, I know.  No, my face isn't in them.  But I feel like you guys probably know what my pussy looks like.  Just from being here so much, you can guess, you know?  Let's guess.  I say we can.  Okay, let's look at three pictures and you guys have to identify.  That would be a really good game.  That would be a good game. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, I'll describe it, pussy.  That would be a wonderful game.  It looks like Holyfield's here after Tyson.  I've seen it.  It's really big.  There's a glove hanging out of it.  It's like that glove from Dressed to Kill when the guy's waving it from the taxi.  Oh, God.  It's like a Bloomin' Onion.  It's just...  Or what's the one at Outback?  I imagine you're very busy these days and stuff, so you probably don't have as much time  to keep it as kempt as you'd like.  So probably a little five o'clock shadow every so often.  What does a tell say?  It looks like it's been upsolving a crime all night. 
[02:00:00]  Is that a tell?  Is that the answer?  No, I'm not a pussy.  Oh, yeah.  That's funny.  That's a great line.  I think that's a tell, yeah.  That's a great line.  No, things are good right now.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Because I'm...  But while we were filming the show, I would kind of catch a glimpse, and I'd be like,  oh, so I guess somebody wants to look like their mom in the 60s.  Things get out of hand.  It got away from you?  It got so away from me, just like, oh, nobody was handling the lawn. 
[02:00:30]  I was just busy.  It's like, yeah, you have to do so much.  I have to go see a stranger, you know?  I have to go see, like, a Russian woman.  Is that it?  Yeah, yeah.  Waxing and stuff?  Yeah, and it's like, just like a woman's, like, you know, like, heads down.  They're right there.  They're right there.  Yeah, and the last time I got it done, like, I hadn't had sex in so long that just, like,  nobody had touched me.  So as soon as she touched me, I, like, got super wet.  Wow!  And then I'm like, does this chick think that I want to, like, fuck her? 
[02:01:00]  Or, like, I was like, no, no, no, it's just my body's reacting, because I...  Can you tell the story again, but I'm going to lie down and point my toes.  It was so fucking embarrassing.  You see her dipping her fist in wax?  She was like a 60-year-old Russian woman.  Oh, man.  Wow.  I think she's just used to that, though.  Yeah, she's got it.  I'm sure she is.  I mean, you're not the first lesbian to show up in her pocket.  You're not the first dirty dirty shoes.  I show up already hairless, wearing a garter. 
[02:01:30]  Exactly.  I don't know what work you can do now.  A schoolgirl skirt and a fucking lollipop.  Oh, my God.  Super wet.  Wow.  That's, uh...  Man.  It was sad.  I was like, oh, I'm lonely, and I haven't been touched in a long time.  Sorry, miss.  Anyone.  Wow.  Anyone touching you then would have...  Yeah, it had been a while.  It had been...  Like, tipped it off.  I mean, you know, and I'm wired to want to do that, so it had been a good three months.  Yeah, I pity you.  I mean, there's turbulence on a plane.  I'm ready to go. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  I know.  You're like, my jaw was wired shut.  I'm like, no one touched my pussy very well.  The violin starts playing.  So there were two holes that were wired shut.  All right.  Nice.  I need to have that wired shut.  I can't believe I'm alive.  Especially, again, because of cabbies.  That's true.  That's one of the greatest stories.  If they didn't want to finger you, why do they have a front seat?  Oh, right.  Those fucking dirty cabbie hands.  He wasn't purelling.  Believe me, he was handling cash. 
[02:02:30]  He was coughing into his hand.  He had the kind of dirt in his hands where you could see the dirt.  Oh, hey, man.  He had just been fixing a bicycle.  Oh, that's terrible.  I bet it's the same cab driver, and he's just, like, mad.  That probably is.  He's just trying to disinfect his hand.  I'm getting certain else on there.  Blood and a baby.  Blood and a baby tooth.  That is a great story.  We've got to ask you about the altercation with the cab driver.  That was in April, right?  Yeah.  That was big news. 
[02:03:00]  It was big news.  It was huge news.  We heard about it.  That means it's big news.  Yeah.  It's a pending legal thing, so I don't know how much I can say, but it's one of those things.  But basically, my job got large shit for six weeks, which is a brutal process.  But I think, you know, knowing that you know about it, you guys read about it, I think  everybody discovered I am literally the only Asian actor working in Hollywood that does  not know martial arts, is what I discovered. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, man.  Right?  It's just brutal, and I wouldn't wish it on anybody.  What happened that day?  And obviously, be careful for the lawsuit.  What can you say?  Yeah.  Well, he, look, I know this.  I don't know what I'm supposed to say or not, but I never touched the guy.  I never touched the guy.  It was, you know, I don't know what the legal term is.  But why were you mad?  Or was he mad?  He was mad.  I don't know exactly.  Oh, okay.  He was mad.  No, I think we can do this, though. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  What was he mad at?  Or what do you think he was mad at?  Basically, this is what it was.  He was, he spent five minutes finishing a cigarette.  And my friend and I were teasing, like, you know, are you finally done with the cigarette?  Because we were, you know, it's a cab line.  So we're waiting to get in a cab.  Gotcha.  And, you know, we're like, hey, can we get in a cab?  I got to finish a cigarette.  And then it's like, we're just waiting, waiting.  Hey, can we just jump in another cab?  Hold on.  I'm next.  You wait.  You wait.  And then that's how it started. 
[02:04:30]  And then it's just like, are you finally done with this?  And then boom.  And he punched you.  Yeah.  Wow.  And it was just one shot.  Well, I guess I said it now.  So that's pretty much it.  No, but that's not going to fuck up your case.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Because that's exactly what you're going to say in court.  A guy strikes you for that?  That's totally uncalled for.  Yeah.  So what would he say?  Clocked.  Well, he actually, I don't know.  I don't know what I'm supposed to say.  That part might be a little sketchy, but.  Yeah.  He went to the. 
[02:05:00]  Better to not say.  I don't see you fucking.  But let's just say this.  He belted you and you had done physically nothing to him.  Right.  That's correct.  And it was, I, you know, it just, it was a horrible experience.  It was a horror.  It was just liquid diet.  And it knocked you down.  Knocked you out?  No, no.  It happened and my head just snapped back.  And as soon as my head snapped, I didn't go down or anything.  You know, I don't know if that's man code or whatever, but I felt good I didn't go down. 
[02:05:30]  But I didn't expect anything.  But as soon as it happened, just the jaw was split.  Oh.  So basically my right side was fine.  My left side was hanging.  You could like do a little flap thing with it.  No.  And I thought I actually lost a tooth at the time.  So as soon as it happened, your instinct is to go after the guy.  But I just said, something's wrong here.  Something's really wrong here.  And my friend, Gareth Reynolds, who's another comedian, he goes, hey, you just hit my friend.  So the cab driver started wailing on him.  Wow.  And I remember Gareth was commentating everything. 
[02:06:00]  He goes, now you're hitting me.  You're hitting me in my face.  So it's like, dude, you're just commenting on it.  Why don't you get him back?  But I couldn't do anything.  I was done.  Did anybody jump in and help?  The other cab drivers pulled him off.  And basically he tried to take off.  So I jumped in front of the cab.  I started snapping pictures.  And that's how I...  With a broken jaw, you jumped in front of his cab.  Yeah.  He was a fucking...  He was ballsy.  Wow.  So your jaw was wired for how long?  Six weeks?  Six weeks, yeah.  How much did it hurt when it first happened? 
[02:06:30]  Look, it was painful.  You can't...  You know, all the things you take for granted.  You can't yawn.  You can't sneeze.  Not yawning would kill me, believe it or not.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, especially when you're in a green room waiting for the retard to wrap up.  Yeah.  And was it like...  It literally is like that.  Yeah.  You're trying to yawn with a...  Yeah.  And just all the muscles, you feel them tensing up in your mouth.  And then you feel the roots of your teeth and just the pain that shivers through your...  Oh, my God.  The worst part is watching television. 
[02:07:00]  You know, I'm watching NHL playoffs.  And I just keep seeing these commercials for Golden Corral and the wings that they have  and the Texas peat sauce.  And I'm going crazy.  Absolutely crazy.  But you can't eat...  It's all liquid diet, yeah.  Oh, that's terrible.  Amy Schoen.  I lost 15...  Wow.  No.  It's Amy.  What's up, baby?  How are ya?  Good, how are you?  Nice to see ya.  I don't know, man.  He's talking about getting his jaw broken.  His jaw wires shut.  What kind of...  I was just bragging about it.  What kind of...  You're talking about that cab driver? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  That's fucking crazy.  You know, they'll also finger you.  They will.  You both have really hot cab stores.  What the fuck?  So then you're just drinking shit through a straw for six weeks?  Just drinking...  Just all liquid diet, you know.  And I was plummeting in weight, so I was blending, like, milkshakes and throwing  cupcakes and cookies in there to just put it back on, which is what Bobby Kelly does,  I think, in a normal way.  Yeah.  That's normal.  That's fine.  As soon as you said, cupcakes.  Yeah.  What was the first thing you ate when your jaw got fixed? 
[02:08:00]  A jawbreaker?  Yeah.  Hard candy.  Oh, pizza.  Hard pizza.  Oh, okay.  That seems easy.  I had to do it, yeah.  Because I got to get those muscles commercials.  Yeah, it took a while to even get back to eating...  Like, I had my first steak, like, a week ago.  Wow.  It's been a few weeks since then, but it was just horrible.  Man, the guy just seemed like a problem.  Well, I'm sorry?  Like, from the start, did the guy seem like a...  Yeah, when he wanted to finish his cigarette, and, you know, it's not how a business should  conduct itself, but...  Did we already ask where race he was? 
[02:08:30]  We didn't mention that.  He looked like a villain in a Taken film, or any Jean-Claude Van Damme, some Western European...  Oh, yeah.  Or I guess Eastern European, it depends what...  The white cab drivers are the scariest ones.  Period.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah, what happened?  Period.  What happened?  What went wrong here?  I had one of these fucking, one of those rickshaw bicycle pedicab guys give me shit.  Nothing worse than standing there, you're hailing a cab, and a parade of these pedal cabs 
[02:09:00]  come by, and it's like, you need to drive...  And I'm like, yeah, I'm going to Brooklyn, asshole, you need to pedal my fucking ass across  the bridge.  You'll find one that will, though.  Dummy?  Yeah, you probably will.  There's always one that will do it.  You know, I did that job when I lived in Santa Barbara.  I was a rickshaw driver.  Oh, did you really?  Really?  I swear.  Oh, Amy.  I was dating this deadbeat guy that had no money, and so I worked for both of us, driving  a pedicab up and down.  Wow.  Would people actually have destinations, or would they just make you ride in a circle while they just  jerked off?  I would have been so much better. 
[02:09:30]  They had destinations, and I sucked at it.  I would be riding up a hill, and I'd feel I was losing momentum, and I'd be like, get  everybody out, and then we'd all have to push it up the hill.  Wow, that was a bad thing.  Just every eight minutes getting smacked on the back of the neck.  Is it raining out?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I wish.  That would have been so flattering.  Things are not looking good at that time.  No, I didn't know they're like 20.  Between the two of us, honestly, who would you...  You in Vegas go, someone drove a rickshaw, the Asian or Amy, but I can't believe she 
[02:10:00]  weren't.  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, that's right.  Not yawning.  That made me claustrophobic when you said that.  You couldn't yawn.  Oh, man.  That's the perfect word for it.  You feel claustrophobic.  You're trapped inside the air.  But you can if you have to cut the wires.  You could, right?  You could.  You're supposed to carry wire cutters in case you throw up, because then you're going  to die.  Oh, God.  You have to carry them with you.  Wire cutters?  Yeah.  What a dream.  How many wires would you have to cut?  That's like...  Ping, ping, ping, ping.  It's literally like that, though.  It's probably like a dozen. 
[02:10:30]  Wow.  The worst is, like, when you have it happen, it's like there's these...  You know, you're out when you get them put in.  You're unconscious?  Yeah.  When you're getting them off, you're conscious.  At least I was.  And it's like little fish hooks dug in between your teeth and your gum.  Oh, my God.  This is torturous.  It was painful getting them out, and I was pretty medicated and numbed up, but it was  rough.  That is archaic.  It's still...  You'd think they'd have something by now.  It's like, no, we still must wire your jaw shut. 
[02:11:00]  But at least they fucking...  I mean, you figure it happens to...  Put leeches on your cheeks.  It happens to fighters sometimes, you know.  Yeah?  Fuck, yeah.  Fighters?  Yeah, fighters.  Fighters.  It happens to fighters.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, the bare-knucklers.  You're married, right?  No.  Married, yeah.  Did you have...  I mean, nobody's worried about you getting married.  Stop flirting.  Did you guys have sex?  Or you were...  Like, what was that like? 
[02:11:30]  No, I felt ugly.  No, seriously.  No, I mean, I really...  I just cocooned my...  I just stayed...  I was, like, depressed.  Yeah.  I did the Mr. Mom.  I grew my beard out and...  Yeah, just...  Put the Whoopie Away Kenny was just...  It was a brutal...  Gave up.  Yeah, it was a brutal experience.  What do you do if you have to yawn or breathe through your mouth?  I am very stuffy.  So what do you do if you have to breathe through your mouth?  Why wouldn't we be able to do that?  Breathe through your mouth?  You can...  I mean, your mouth still works.  Yeah.  You can't open it.  Like, your lips are wired shut. 
[02:12:00]  Well, my lips still work, yeah.  I just can't chug dong anymore.  Yeah, that's what Jimmy's really asking.  Yeah.  Were your teeth together?  Teeth were together.  And it just...  You know, it sucked.  When you go out in public...  Oh, yeah, you can breathe through your mouth, can't you?  Yeah.  I'm just like, hey, can I get a coffee or whatever?  And they're like...  It's your problem.  And so my jaw's wired shut.  I'm sorry.  And then they speak louder to you.  It's like...  That I never understood.  It's your fucking problem.  You got an attitude, man?  Yeah.  Relax.  No.  I am relaxed.  I can't talk.  Don't worry about it.  And then you don't want to start anything because you don't want to get hit again. 
[02:12:30]  I'm like, I'm going to imagine that.  Oh, somebody's going to clonk me again.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  You must have post-traumatic stress a little bit.  Well, I wasn't, you know, driving a Humvee in Iraq, so I had to like...  But, I mean, look...  Say you have that.  You avoid conflict for...  It's going to help the fucking lawsuit.  No one likes being assaulted, though.  I mean, really.  Think about it.  It's something that takes something away from you as a human being.  It's such a violation.  Yes.  You should not be allowed to just hurt someone physically.  Yeah, without getting some, like, payback.  That's right, Jimmy. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  That's sweet of you, Jim.  We're going to ask.  Spot on, Jim.  Who are you suing?  The cab driver?  Sue everyone.  Are you suing everyone?  The city?  Everyone's going down.  Hollywood's going to know my name.  Yeah.  After him and the cab...  I don't know if I'm supposed to say this, but he left the country.  Wow.  So he left...  You can say that.  He cleaned the country, right?  Yeah, that's a fact.  Oh, man.  So how the hell are you getting...  I don't know.  Well, there's a cab company.  Cab company, I guess.  There's a cab company, and... 
[02:13:30]  Was this L.A.?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh, you're going to make a couple mil.  Typical L.A.  Fucking L.A., right?  Also, the studio, I'm sure, would want to take action because it cost them a lot of money.  Yeah, that was the worst part, is that, you know, 15 years as a comic, you work,  and you get this opportunity, and then I remember before I went under, I was looking at my wife,  and I was on the phone with Peter Billingsley, the executive producer, and he was online  with TBS and the executives there, and they're like, hey, can you hold off on getting the 
[02:14:00]  operation?  We just want to get everything straightened out.  And the doctor's looking at me going, you've got to do this.  You have to go under right now because every minute is another...  It's a gaping wound.  You could get infected.  He's like, we've got to take care of it right now.  I said, I'm sorry.  I've got to get the operation done.  You guys have got to do what you've got to do.  And, you know, it's a testament, again, to TBS and Billingsley that they...  I mean, they made everything work.  Look, TBS could have canceled the show, but they were just...  How far from production were you when that happened?  We were three in, so we filmed three episodes. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, you already started?  Oh, God.  Okay.  So it was crazy.  It was the one night I was literally doing everything right.  You know, I got a newborn child.  I didn't want to jeopardize anything.  I'm married.  Did you say...  Did you look up and say, nothing can go wrong now?  Yeah.  I'm going to get hit, and then...  Wow, I'm on quite a ride.  I think you got a hold of everything.  Then all of a sudden it starts raining on me, and, yeah, the summer storm, and...  Oh, my God.  It was brutal.  Jesus.  I was taking a cab.  I had four drinks, and I'm like, I'm not even going to chance it.  I'm going to do the right thing tonight. 
[02:15:00]  Because I remember on Oprah hearing, you could have a drink and a half and get pulled over  and get...  I was like, ah.  So you got to blame Oprah on this one.  That's a lot of Oprah references.  A lot of Oprah now.  I just remember that one episode.  Hey, I personally...  I don't know what you can say.  You know, you probably don't want to say anything like that, but me personally, I would  want the guy dead.  Like, I would be obsessing over the fact that I would want that guy dead, the cab driver.  Yes, yes.  The village.  I would fucking use money to hire a mercenary to have him killed. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  I think that would be you.  I would just, like, I can't live with things like that.  But if you guys got that one, you got that one at later, this will be my one.  Of course.  That's your one.  Boy, oh, man.  You think that's your one?  Hopefully that's your one.  Hopefully that's my one, yeah.  But, you know, that's one of the things that happens, and it's like, you can't plan for  that.  Some guy's just going to fucking react like a psychopath to a minor altercation.  I think that.  Yeah.  But, look, you know, every guy, I think you have one, and then you have another one.  That's the opposite.  You have one where you got the better of it, but you focus on missing talent. 
[02:16:00]  I think I have that.  Or you've avoided one that you'll never know.  The Worst of the Week, Countdown.  On the Opie Anthony Channel.  Sirius XM.  A download.

Still a lot to do this week on the Worst of the Week Countdown with me, Sam Roberts, from After ONA Live, and of course, the Opie and Anthony show.  What else is going on?  Yes, Tony Soprano calling in from beyond the grave.  Not yet, still to come.  First, Ricky Gervais was in studio. 
[02:21:00]  Now, Ricky Gervais was booked to come into studio around 10 o'clock this week.  That's when the show ends.  When the show ends, Opie and Anthony go home.  Who was left to talk to Ricky Gervais?  Jim Norton and yours truly, Sam Roberts.  Thank God Ricky Gervais is a talented man because Jim and I would have just floundered in mediocrity.  Ricky Gervais in studio without Opie or Anthony on the countdown. 
[02:21:30]  Number two.  Number two.  Talk about the language where they say, he got in trouble for Sam, I'm going to kill this guy or whatever it was he said.  I mean, now you do stand-up, and what are you feeling about, because I don't know how I feel about the language policing that's going on in stand-up,  or the obsession over terms and all this stuff that people are giving comedians.  Uh, well, I think, um, it depends.  I mean, I assume you're talking about offence.  Yeah, or what people find are offensive or inappropriate. 
[02:22:00]  Well, offence isn't a case of right and wrong, is it?  It's about, it's about, um, feelings, and feelings are personal.  Um, I think you've got to, you know, comedy comes from a good or a bad place.  You've got to know, you know, what side you're on.  Um, but, um...  I can't believe it.  Now Roland's talking.  I know, Roland, he does it a lot.  It's rude.  It's unbelievable.  Roland, he'll come in and dare people to look at us while he does it.  Yeah.  Um, so, uh, I mean, you have to take everything.  When people say to me, they ask comedians this all the time, 
[02:22:30]  is there anything you wouldn't joke about?  Right?  Firstly, the answer's no.  There's nothing you shouldn't joke about.  It depends what the joke is.  Okay?  But people don't say that to writers.  They don't say to a novelist,  is there anything you wouldn't write about?  Well, no.  So we know it's about how it's treated.  So they assume that, um, comedians treat things without, um,  care, due care and attention.  They're not considered.  Like they have no morality.  I see this all the time on Twitter. 
[02:23:00]  Um, this, this, people who think that, uh, uh,  they say things to me like, um, uh,  so are you never offended by anything?  I say, of course I'm offended by things.  But it's personal.  But what I'm offended about isn't the same as you.  You know, you can't, it's not objective.  And you don't want people penalized for being, for offending you.  You don't want them to get in trouble if they offend you.  Um, no.  Well, it, again, it, it, you have to be specific.  You can't really talk in the nebulous because it's too difficult.  So, but, um, uh, 
[02:23:30]  uh, so in my show, I deal,  the, the, the big thing is that very often,  with, particularly with taboo subjects,  which is what we're talking about,  um,  very often people mistake the target of the joke  with the subject of a joke.  And they're very rarely related,  particularly in comedy,  particularly if it's mildly satirical,  and particularly if it's a good comedian  who knows what they're doing.  Um, so, uh, people's, um,  they get stiff when you talk about, you know,  race, disability, religion, okay? 
[02:24:00]  But wait, wait,  because everything I deal with is,  is in those taboo subjects.  And you, you talk about,  like now, we're not trying to be funny,  we're talking,  and so we're, we're using all those terms.  No one's, no one's angsty.  No one's going,  but they're,  because they know there's not a joke.  We know that we're discussing it,  and they know that, you know,  you can talk about those subjects.  But when it comes to a comedian,  and obviously,  very often,  comedians aren't being themselves,  they're being a heightened version,  or they're being, uh, provocateur,  or they're trying to take the audience 
[02:24:30]  to places it hasn't been before,  and people get confused.  And I think that it comes down to  people getting it or not.  And, uh, I, I sort of,  I want to sort of say to people,  you not getting my joke  isn't my problem, really.  I shouldn't even be defending it.  I shouldn't even be talking about comedy  as a comedian.  I should, you know,  but I do,  because I like to do it as an interest.  But I'm not talking about this as an expert,  or as a, as a professional.  I'm talking about this as,  as just a person.  Because I like,  I like discussing these issues, 
[02:25:00]  and, you know.  And we all know the difference between,  and this is what bothers me  about people's fake outrage.  I don't believe the outrage.  Because we all know the difference in intent  when someone's intending to make you laugh,  and the difference between that  and when someone's making a serious statement.  Yeah.  There's a different intent  and a different effect you want it to have  on the audience.  Absolutely correct.  And they know that.  And they pretend they don't know it.  Well, I think comedy is a,  as an intellectual pursuit.  And I think as soon as it gets emotional on purpose,  i.e. with intention from the comedian,  it stops being funny,  and it stops being comedy. 
[02:25:30]  It starts being rallying.  I mean,  I've had,  I've heard some,  so-called comedians come out,  and they say things like,  um,  what are we going to do  about all these immigrants?  And it gets a round of applause  from the audience.  They think,  well,  that's,  that's not a joke.  Right,  there's no punchline.  That's political.  That's just you putting your agenda across  with like-minded people.  You know?  Yes.  So,  I'd say that,  and then very often they say,  well,  do you think that's so-and-so joke?  I want to say,  well,  it wasn't a joke.  Mm-hmm.  You know,  um,  like Michael Richards going crazy.  Uh, 
[02:26:00]  you know,  he was,  he was stressed.  He,  it's someone upset him.  He wanted to hurt that person's feelings.  Yes.  Right?  Uh,  that wasn't comedy.  I think he stepped outside of comedy.  I'm not disclaiming it,  because I'm a comedian.  I want to say,  I think he did something other than comedy.  He was reacting angrily  as opposed to being funny.  Definitely.  Exactly.  So yeah,  yeah,  well,  he wasn't being a comedian.  He was being a bloke  who was a,  he stepped out of character almost.  And we're all,  we're always in character a bit  when we're,  you know,  we're being a comedian.  And we want the audience  to make that leap with us. 
[02:26:30]  What,  what about the idea,  and somebody hit you with this  on the phone earlier this week,  like the responsibility that you have  for,  because you're talking to an audience.  So like,  let's say the audience  doesn't get your nuance  or doesn't understand what you're saying  and takes the context of your joke  and,  but,  well,  I don't think you should legislate  against stupidity.  Because there's only so many nods  and winks to cameras  before you're not doing anything special at all.  If everyone gets what you say,  there's not much to get. 
[02:27:00]  Why do we want everyone to understand?  Why do we want to talk to a groom full of adults  who have paid $100  the same as we talk to a five-year-old?  You know,  you talk to a five-year-old  because they have to get what you're saying.  It's important that they understand  what you're saying  without ambiguity,  with,  with no frills,  with no,  with no agenda,  with no,  um,  double meaning  or level.  Don't,  don't put your hand in the fire.  Why not?  Don't.  Don't put your hand,  do you understand me?  Don't put your hand in the fire. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  That's not my job as a comedian  to tell them not to put their hand in the fire.  Not to fucking spoon-feed them,  exactly.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  You know,  I've entered a contract here  and the contract is,  I'll say what the fuck I like  and if you don't like it,  don't come again.  Or just get up and quietly go.  Like,  the people with the whole Tosh incident  about the rape joke  and it was like,  that woman was wrong  because she heckled.  Like,  I thought that she had every right  to get up and leave  because if you're not enjoying something,  you should just leave.  But not to take control of the show.  It's not your business to do that  because you wouldn't do it  in a movie theater.  Let me tell you, 
[02:28:00]  if she was in a movie theater  and she was in, say,  or watching a,  she wouldn't dare  stand up and throw paint on the screen  if she saw something she objected to  or she wouldn't put her hand  in front of the projector  so nobody else could see it,  she would just leave.  But because you're in the room with her,  people feel entitled  to make you know their opinion.  Well,  that's the difference,  again,  between freedom of speech  and censorship.  Censorship  isn't  turning off  your own telly.  That's up to you. 
[02:28:30]  Censorship  is making everyone else  turn off their telly  because you don't like  what's on the telly.  And that's a big difference.  And I think  people sometimes get confused  with what  freedom of speech is,  you know.  basically,  I think offence  is the collateral damage  of freedom of speech.  Some people don't get offended  by anything you say.  Somewhere,  somewhere,  they might not get it,  they might not care for it,  it might not be their cup of tea.  And that's fine,  you know,  but they have the choice.  You know,  as a comedian,  I don't go around 
[02:29:00]  knocking on doors  and sitting on people's shelves  and shouting my shit at them.  They've come into my world.  They've come into my church.  Do you know?  Yeah.  They're going to hear my sermon.  That was a great way,  sorry to not understand me,  that was a great way  to phrase it.  Offence is the collateral damage  of free speech.  That's a really good way  to say it.  And people don't understand  free speech either.  No, they don't.  They think that means  you can do anything.  I say about freedom of speech  is one of the most important things  that we have  in a civilised society,  freedom of speech, right? 
[02:29:30]  And I have to explain to them,  and I say,  why do you block people?  I say,  well, that's up to me.  Your freedom of speech  isn't your freedom to be heard.  Right.  Or,  even if you're heard,  listened to,  or even if you're heard  and listened to,  taken seriously.  The freedom of speech  ends with you saying  what you want.  And it's the same principle  as you saying  that they came to your church.  Like, if you're tweeting  something out,  you don't intend  for the world to see it.  You intend for those  who follow you to see it. 
[02:30:00]  Exactly, yeah.  You've come to my door  and you've complained  about what I'm saying  on my sofa.  It's my sofa.  Just leave quietly.  You don't have to do anything.  Just go home.  Just block me, whatever.  And this is what an idiot  says as well  about freedom of speech.  And they say,  oh, what?  So Hitler was right?  No, because he wasn't  saying things, was he?  He was killing people.  That's not saying,  that's doing.  And his intent  was not to make you laugh.  It was to rally people  to genocide.  Right.  Big difference 
[02:30:30]  between that  and what...  Genocide is not covered  within the boundaries  of freedom of speech, right.  That's doing what you do, yeah.  And then, you know,  if Hitler just went  around saying shit,  fine.  Yeah.  It's allowed.  If he just went around,  if the worst thing  Hitler did was say  awful things,  okay, okay,  he's a bit of an idiot.  I don't want to be his friend.  Right.  But...  He's allowed to say it.  As long as he doesn't  put anything into action.  You're okay, Hitler.  Yeah.  You're okay  with your funny little mustache.  Don't do anything,  though, will you?  No.  Okay, he's illegal.  His first murder.  His first murder. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, you don't have to  step them out there, mate.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You did the line.  Oh.  You did it.  Yeah, but we're talking,  you know.  There's another phrase  that annoys me  as well.  Militant atheist.  Militant atheist?  Uh-huh.  Well, you mean I said stuff.  That's what,  that's what a militant atheist is.  Yeah.  I'm going to go  onto a crowded tube station,  unbutton my shot,  and talk about science and shit.  Um, yeah.  Horrible army.  Yeah.  There's so many things  I want people to know. 
[02:31:30]  What militant means,  what freedom of speech is,  what, what, um,  oh, the burden of proof.  People,  there are people  who tweet me things like,  you can't prove God doesn't exist.  No, no, I can't.  Yes.  Great.  I say things like,  you can't prove Santa doesn't exist.  Like, I don't be so ridiculous,  go on Santa.  Well, that's insanity.  It's ridiculous.  Of course he doesn't.  This man with a white beard  doing shit in that time.  Don't be fucking bollocks.  You're great on Twitter, man. 
[02:32:00]  You really,  I love the fact that  as famous as you are  and as big as your career is,  it's like you don't worry  about saying the wrong thing  and, and you don't,  I love that you,  as long as you're honest,  you can't be held accountable, really.  Um, in that,  that Tosh,  what's his name?  Daniel Tosh?  Yeah, I didn't know  about the joke or anything.  I, it was,  it was raging  and people were asking me,  what do you think about Daniel Tosh?  I said, what's happened?  Said, uh,  rape joke,  it shouldn't be a rape joke.  There's no,  you should never joke about,  I said,  well, it depends what the joke is.  No, of course it doesn't,  you should never rape. 
[02:32:30]  And then someone sent me a tweet  and she said,  I will laugh at a rape joke  the day I know  that no one in that audience  has been raped.  And I just tweeted back,  what a strange door policy.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Two, please.  Uh, certainly that's,  can I just ask you a question?  Have you been raped?  I have, yeah.  You can't come in.  I'm sorry.  It's a policy,  it's not me.  No, because there's a woman  at the front  and she's only going to laugh  and she knows  that no one in the audience  has been raped. 
[02:33:00]  So, uh,  that was a great one.  Yeah, I remember that  very specifically.  But like,  but what an ass she is  to say that  because that means  you won't laugh  at a drunk driving joke  or you won't laugh  at a pedophile joke  or you won't laugh  at any kind of  domestic violence reference.  What is a rape joke?  You know,  I wouldn't,  you know,  I'm not,  I don't find  rape funny.  No, it's terrible.  It's terrible.  It's one of the worst,  he does things  but there's so many levels 
[02:33:30]  to get.  I mean,  technically the door policy joke  is a rape joke.  Well, if that's a,  yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  I think so.  I think,  I think they mean  the subject of rape  as opposed to,  you know,  again,  if you're laughing  at someone who's been raped,  that's not a joke.  That's just,  you're a horrible,  nasty,  but I don't find it funny.  There are some people  that would find it funny  but they're serial killers  and rapists.  Right.  Okay.  And the,  the thing is,  again,  stupid people, 
[02:34:00]  um,  treat jokes about bad things  with the same fear and loathing  as intelligent people  treat the actual bad thing  and they're not related.  You know,  a joke about,  that's what humour's for.  To,  to get us over bad things.  That's exactly what,  even loosely speaking,  a humour,  it gets us over bad shit.  If you can't joke about bad shit,  there's no point  joking about good shit.  Yeah,  because it's already happening.  We don't need it.  We don't need it.  It's already good again.  Everyone likes a balloon.  Who gives a shit? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Laughter is this drug  that cures bad shit.  It's a drug,  it's a drug here.  It cures good shit.  I don't want that.  Yeah.  I like,  I like good shit.  Yeah.  I want some of that  cures bad shit.  Well,  laughter's the best medicine.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  And you know what?  Those people,  a lot of them aren't dumb  but a lot of them aren't dumb.  A lot of them aren't dumb.  A lot of them are,  like dumb is almost  letting some of them off.  Some of them are dumb  but some of them are  so self-centered  in their opinion  and there's a real  self-centeredness  that comes with it  and a self-importance  about what I feel 
[02:35:00]  is appropriate  is appropriate  and what you feel  is appropriate  is not  and I'm the arbiter of that.  Well,  they don't,  they don't,  they don't,  they don't like a comedian  having this superpower  of freedom of speech  and exercising it so well.  Right.  They can't stand it.  I mean,  these are the people  that go to comedy shows  with the intent  to catch you  doing something wrong  and catch you  saying something  you weren't supposed to  so then they can blog about it  or they can,  you know,  tell the world  that you shouldn't be  doing what you do.  Yesterday,  someone tweeted me,  there is a cure for cancer.  It is called praying.  And I sent back, 
[02:35:30]  your application  for chief of oncology  at the hospital  has not been successful.  Right?  Sure.  So,  so that's a clear joke  about how stupid  it would be  if we took praying  as a cure for cancer seriously  as opposed to  all that stuff  that cures cancer  that we've researched,  right?  Someone gets involved  saying,  oh,  so you're laughing  at the fact  there's no cure for cancer.  Nope.  I'm laughing at you  because you're a stupid  fucking idiot.  Right.  So you don't get  what I was saying. 
[02:36:00]  Basically,  he's angry  on false pretenses.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've had it happen to me.  Someone in the paper  has said,  look at this terrible joke  and they've done the joke  and it's wrong.  They've got the joke wrong.  It's so important.  Every,  every aspect of a joke  is important.  The syntax,  the semantics,  the rhyming,  sometimes even some  of the visual aid  that comes with it.  Taken out of context,  it's,  the better the joke,  the more fragile it is.  Well,  sarcasm doesn't read  in print.  You know,  I'm happy he died.  Reads terribly like, 
[02:36:30]  oh yeah,  I'm happy he died.  There's a tremendous,  that was me acting.  There's a tremendous difference  and people know that  and we have that common  bond of language.  But people,  what I hate about people  is they pretend  they don't know it  because the bigger goal  is to get you  to not say  what they don't like.  Exactly.  And that's all it is.  Right.  And some people,  you know,  there's,  again,  there's,  in a Venn diagram,  there'd be lots  and lots of overlaps,  but some people  are genuinely angry  and they don't know  why everyone  doesn't find  the same things  wrong as they do.  Then they just 
[02:37:00]  want a retweet.  Then they just  don't like you.  Then they just  want to say something  because no one  listens to them.  Yeah.  Ever.  That's often,  that's often the case.  An excuse to be heard.  Absolutely.  An excuse to be heard.  They're frustrated  that they're not heard  like we are,  that they haven't got  that platform.  So they want to bring us  down a peg or two.  And if they say,  if you say you're sorry  and if you've wounded  somebody,  when people are wounded,  what's wrong?  Talk.  We'll listen to you now.  Yeah.  People want to pretend  that they're wounded  by somebody who works.  Well, yeah.  I have many complaints.  You know,  I used to work in a public sector.  I used to work at a university 
[02:37:30]  and I had a complaint.  And sometimes they just  couldn't believe  you called them back.  They go,  oh, thanks.  Don't worry about it.  They wanted to talk to someone.  Yeah.  They wanted to be heard.  And, you know,  that's all that.  They were happy.  They were happy.  You know,  and I think that is  the case sometimes.  But I did a show,  Madison Square Garden,  okay?  So,  a lot of people,  I did jokes about,  um,  uh,  race,  the Holocaust,  uh,  um,  uh,  Anne Frank jokes.  Oh, no. 
[02:38:00]  Um,  paedophile jokes,  everything.  I got a letter  from, um,  a society saying,  oh,  we loved your show.  We found it,  uh,  we were very disappointed  at the joke about Anne Frank.  Right?  And I,  I said,  but you understood  the satire behind  the famine joke,  the paedophile joke,  the racist joke.  You understood that  because it wasn't  your thing.  Right.  But you can't get over  your thing.  You think,  well,  why is,  you know,  I'm the same with some things.  I don't like certain jokes  about certain things 
[02:38:30]  because I,  I can't get over them  emotionally.  You know,  I've got to keep that quiet.  I've just got to,  you know,  you've got to,  you've got to take the rough  with a smooth,  you know.  And you can understand  on that intellectual level  that if their intent here,  here,  and here was not malicious,  here it probably wasn't  malicious either.  Yeah.  You know?  Just because you don't like  that being brought up  doesn't mean that this guy  was trying to hurt  your feelings.  No,  exactly.  And that's what it feels like.  That's what offense feels like.  Offense feels that,  why is he having a go at me? 
[02:39:00]  And you've got to step back  from that and go,  well,  he's not having a go at me.  He doesn't even know you.  Yeah.  Unless I name you.  Right.  You know,  I think that's,  that's,  that's one thing  I don't do too often.  I don't say,  well,  one,  I,  you know,  again,  it depends what the target  of the joke is.  And sometimes even  if you name someone,  they're not actually  the target of the joke.  They're instrumental  in getting to the target of the joke.  So I can understand  why someone would feel bullied  if,  God,  he just got on stage  and talked about it. 
[02:39:30]  it's,  you,  you have to take  the personal out of it.  I think,  you know,  and I think that the better  the joke is,  the more universal it is.  Or if they admitted  what they're really doing.  Like,  I would respect people  if they said,  you said something  I don't like  and I really don't want you  to be able to say it.  But there's a self-centeredness  in that honesty  that they won't do.  So what they have to do  is create,  even to themselves,  a reason that seems legit.  Well,  here's why you shouldn't  make fun of race.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  But here's why you shouldn't  make fun of drunk.  Everyone has a reason. 
[02:40:00]  No one ever just comes out  and says the truth,  which is,  I don't like it  and I don't want you to say it.  There's an ugliness in that.  Well,  I think there are reasons  you shouldn't make fun of race  because no one can help their race.  But you can make fun about race.  You can make jokes about race.  Right.  But you shouldn't make,  you should,  I don't think you should,  this is what I'm saying  about the target  and the subject are different.  You know,  the reason why  you shouldn't have a go  at anyone for anything,  they can't help.  And the reason why  real racist jokes  aren't funny to me, 
[02:40:30]  and not because I'm offended by them,  because they're not true.  As soon as someone says,  why do Mexicans  da da da da,  that fact is usually spurious.  It's not a true fact.  There's an injustice to it.  Okay.  Do you know what I mean?  I do.  I don't know if I agree,  but I do know what you mean.  Well, if someone said,  why are Swedish people  all paedophiles?  My first thought is,  they're not.  Oh.  I can't,  now I can't laugh  whatever the punchline is.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah,  and Jim wanted to move  when you were there.  I was just kidding. 
[02:41:00]  I'm going to fucking  go for dual citizenship.  So,  I think,  I think,  again,  the joke fails.  If every part of it  is totally untrue,  it's rallying,  and that would be,  that to me would be people  wanting,  you'd need them  to all agree with that.  Hey,  all the Swedish people  involved for it to be funny  or get around applause.  And so,  it fails,  it fails purely  on a comedic level to me.  Okay.  Not on a political one.  Right, right.  Do you know what I mean?  I do.  And you're also not saying 
[02:41:30]  that people should get,  the important thing for me  is if somebody,  there's certain jokes  I don't like too.  Yeah.  But if,  I've never called for anyone  to be penalized for them.  And so I never have a problem  with people saying  they don't like  certain type of jokes.  No.  Or they don't think,  like I had a debate  with a feminist  who I actually wound up liking  on an FX show  and we talked about rape.  You just said that  like it was a surprise.  I went in there  with all the prejudices  you would have.  Well,  I was surprised though  because her opinion  and mine are vastly different  and we didn't change 
[02:42:00]  each other's opinions  but we had a respectful discussion.  I think I saw it.  I think I saw it.  I think it was,  yeah.  It was on,  yeah,  it was online  and come out about it.  But,  you know,  the thing was  she wasn't calling  for people to be censored.  She had a very tricky argument.  We just didn't see eye to eye  and the frustrating,  everyone comes to a crossroad  in the debate  where we realize  we're not going to change  each other's minds.  So do we say,  okay,  but that's when people get angry  when we don't get our way  and can't change their mind.  as I remember,  and I don't want to misquote her,  but as I remember,  her worry was  that,  I think she had a term 
[02:42:30]  called,  Rape culture?  Rape culture,  yeah,  where the assumption was  if it's all out in the open  and it's okay to joke about,  it desensitizes people  and can cause  an environment  where rape wasn't so  heinous and terrible  and I don't believe that.  I don't either.  I don't think anyone  has ever gone,  I saw a funny rape routine.  I'm going to try it tonight.  Right.  I don't think that's ever happened.  I don't either.  I don't either.  And I think that's a big misconception 
[02:43:00]  because we can joke  about terrible things  that we're somehow condoning it  is totally untrue  and I couldn't find  the actual bad things  that I joke about  more offensive  and more disgusting  and want them to end more  than anyone I ever know,  but that doesn't stop me  joking about them.  That's the challenge.  To me,  that's almost what  the beauty of being a comic is.  It was like,  I did jokes about  the beheading in Britain  and the point was...  Okay, that's too much.  The point of the joke was 
[02:43:30]  it had something to do  with the way  radical Islam treats women,  which was negative.  But people,  like you said,  they grow up.  Well, of course.  The minute they hear...  I need to hear the joke.  Yeah, you need to hear it.  You need to hear it.  Exactly.  It depends.  And as you said,  you said joked about it.  And that's the important thing.  At no point  do I imagine  you ever condoned  that act of violence.  No, and people know,  and people read sarcasm  and people,  you know,  it's like a lot of times, 
[02:44:00]  and there's been times  where I've said things  that I didn't sincerely mean,  but a lot of times  the joke is in the ludicrousness  of the opinion.  Of course.  Like people know,  and every reasonable person knows  that you don't mean that.  It's like if you say  your dick is eight feet long,  nobody actually says,  no it's not,  and means it literally.  They're fucking morons.  Well, some people are morons.  Some people don't understand it.  And I do that.  And as I say,  you sort of play a slight character.  And I think people get to know  the thing you're playing.  I started with stand-up  and on TV 
[02:44:30]  playing a character  that I'd said all the wrong things,  but everyone knew that,  you know.  I came down politically  on the wrong side.  I say things like,  Nelson Mandela,  what a great man.  It used to get a round of applause.  Just saying that  I got a round of applause  in the right audiences.  They just clapped.  Just clapped his name.  Incarcerated for 25 years.  He's been out now  about 20 years  and he hasn't re-offended.  I think he's going straight.  Which shows you  prison does work.  But they knew  that was wrong.  They knew that was  back to front week. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  I get it.  He's misunderstanding.  You know,  so they understand  some things,  but it's not their thing.  Right.  It's not their thing.  That whole thing,  that's what's so weird  about what's happened  with the internet  is that because  you would think,  you're putting out  so much content  on the internet now,  and you would think  that that would be  the ultimate sort of,  this is where I put my stuff.  If you like my stuff,  here's the link to it.  If you don't like it,  you never have to click it.  You never have to see it.  It's not on your TV.  It's not going to pop up at you.  None of that's ever  going to happen. 
[02:45:30]  But people,  even more so  than anywhere else,  of course,  seek out what they don't like  so they can write a comment,  so they can tweet you  some nonsense.  Of course.  So they think  everything's personal, yeah.  Yeah.  Basically,  Twitter,  if you follow someone,  you've got to imagine  that you're standing  by a notice board  in the middle of a big town,  and someone comes up  and puts up guitar lessons,  right?  And then they're standing  and they go,  but I don't want  to learn guitar.  Well, no,  it's not actually a 
[02:46:00]  I don't want to learn guitar.  I want to learn banjo.  I don't,  I don't do  until they forget  that they're standing  by the notice board  in the middle of a big town.  Right.  Keep walking,  you'll find banjo lessons somewhere.  It might be banjo lessons somewhere.  I don't know.  Well, why tell me that?  I wasn't talking to you.  Honestly,  I wasn't talking to you.  So, yeah,  everyone takes everything personally.  And everyone thinks  that what they care about  is what everyone  should care about.  Right.  And that's,  that's a,  that's a given. 
[02:46:30]  The worst of the week countdown.  Countdown.  We've done it.  Made it to number one  on the worst of the week countdown.  I'm Sam Roberts  from After ONA Live.  And of course,  the Opie and Anthony show.  You can find me  on Twitter  at NotSam.  The number one bit this week,  Tony Sopranos  calling in  from beyond the grave.  Now,  we were all broken up  when we found out  James Gandolfini  passed away  way too soon.  Horrible circumstances.  And what a talented  performer he was.  But another talented 
[02:47:00]  performer called in.  Apparently,  it was Tony Soprano  on  sleeping pills.  I don't remember  the name of them.  Calling in  from beyond the grave.  It's the popular  sleeping pill.  The name escapes me.  But as I'm listening  to this,  I will remember it.  Ambien.  Ambien is what he was on.  Tony Soprano  from beyond the grave.  Number one.  Why?  Who's this? 
[02:47:30]  I fucking died.  Oh, no.  It's not what I fucking wanted.  I'm 51 fucking years old.  What are you fucking kidding me?  I still had fucking work  to do down here.  Fucking shattered.  And I'm glad  I died in Rome.  It's kind of poetic  if you look at it.  Jeez.  Wow.  Wow.  What happened?  Let me tell you something. 
[02:48:00]  I'm a gluttonous  son of a bitch.  But more than that,  there might be  other elements.  Things I can't talk about.  I'll tell you  one of the first thoughts  I had when I heard  he was dead  is,  fuck,  I should have come back  that day and met him.  I wish I had,  because he was here  one day at three  and I was doing  something legitimate  for work.  But I remember going,  I want to go back  and meet him,  but I think I couldn't.  And I was like,  fuck,  I was so mad.  Right.  And I go,  God,  I wish I would have  come back and met him.  So you automatically  think of my little  being affected by it. 
[02:48:30]  Right.  Such an unimportant thing.  I'm glad I never met you.  I've got to be honest.  Everybody thinks  I'm a four-loving guy.  I'm fucking not.  Leave me the fuck alone.  I'm miserable.  Holy shit.  That's another thing  that Gandalfini probably  would have said  exactly like that.  Exactly.  Look,  I appreciate it very much.  But can you back  the fuck away?  You're invading  my personal space.  I'm in no mood.  What? 
[02:49:00]  What are we going to do  without Gandalfini?  It's panic.  What are you going to do?  You're going to fucking  shit your ass down  and shut the fuck up.  I think a lot of people  will be seeing  your YouTube videos  in the coming days  because now they're  going to be searching out  all sorts of  Gandalfini stuff.  Yeah.  You know?  I was only 51.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It doesn't make  any fucking sense, huh?  I just had a little girl.  Now what?  I never wanted to be 
[02:49:30]  one of those  deadbeat dads  that's not around  to take care of the kids.  I got to tell you something,  this really fucking hurts.  I was having a good time  even though  it was a bit of a crank.  What did Brad Pitt say?  Is he all right?  Nah, he's really upset  about your passing there.  Oh yeah?  Yeah.  He's got a lot  to be upset about.  Look at him  with his zombie movies,  his long blonde hair, 
[02:50:00]  this Adonis.  He's a good guy though.  But I got to say,  I enjoy playing off of him.  Did a couple movies  they got to give me.  He sounds just like that.  Oh.  Man.  Man is right.  What do you have to say  about all the people  that are really,  really, really sad?  I don't know.  I feel really bad for him.  Then again,  I'm sort of floating around  in these vapors here  and I don't know  what's going on yet.  I mean,  I can't tell you  there's life after death 
[02:50:30]  because I don't know yet.  Give a man a minute.  It's not like you're  bored in a cosmic drain.  Fucking Ambien.  Well,  did you see the light?  People talk about the light.  People talk about the light,  don't they?  I saw AJ.  I saw Meadow.  I saw Carmela.  I saw him young  and then as I started to 
[02:51:00]  ascend further up  into the sky,  they started to get older.  And then I saw babies.  I didn't recognize them.  It's very weird.  And then,  it's like  that night at Holstein's  when everything went black.  And she got a baby.  I don't want to fucking be dead.  I want to watch  my little girl grow up.  This sucks. 
[02:51:30]  Jesus.  Not to mention  all the food I'm going to miss.  The food and the beverages  and the lifestyle.  I got very comfortable.  I got a lot of respect.  But I was tortured.  Come on.  You gotta be  pretty fucked up  to play a part like that.  Tony Soprano.  At least you'll see  Christopher when you're there.  Right.  Fucking A.T.  Welcome.  Get your fucking ass 
[02:52:00]  up here right fucking now.  And let's  go for a fucking ride.  Oh, yeah?  I'm gonna miss him.  What about  AJ?  I mean,  you think AJ's  gonna be alright  with your passing there,  Tony?  I don't know.  I'm gonna be fine.  I want money.  I want money.  I was saying that all day.  Just walking around my house.  I want money.  The eyes really wide. 
[02:52:30]  I'm gonna be fine.  I knew he would die  eventually,  but not like this.  So now what?  I don't want to lose  my bedroom.  Oh, my God.  Well, I did write a script  a couple weeks ago,  which is really eerily  about this.  So  it  makes it even more  compounded  now that it's all  going down.  What was the script  about?  It's basically 
[02:53:00]  Carmela telling T  he's gotta go  because he's dead.  He's gotta let go  because  he goes to the fridge  and there's nothing  in there for him.  He doesn't understand.  Carm,  what the fuck?  You gotta keep  the meats on tap.  What's with the  fucking yogurt?  Go,  I'm gonna go.  Yeah.  She says,  you gotta go.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:53:30]  Why?  I live here.  She's like,  no, you don't.  You don't live here anymore.  You gotta go.  What am I doing?  What am I doing?  I'm fine.  I can take care of everything.  I've got it covered here.  I've made changes  in life.  I can do it.  But you need  to get out of here.  Okay.  What if I'm scared?  Well,  it's gonna be okay.  You're not gonna go to hell. 
[02:54:00]  I'm not gonna tell  the whole thing,  but it's that  Oh, wow.  He was on the phone.  That's amazing.  Sounds amazingly  like I'm  it's very,  very creepy now.  It is creepy.  Now it's creepy.  What's even creepier  is that we get a call  from Gandolfini  from the afterlife  and some ass  keeps showing up  and taking the phone  from him.  James,  James,  okay,  you gotta go.  Max,  they don't wanna hear you. 
[02:54:30]  They don't wanna hear me.  I know.  I know they do.  But you're very upset  and you're on Ambien.  No,  you're on Ambien.  Now you get to listen  to his schizo talk.  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  Again,  creepy.  Yeah.  You need to work  on the Carmela voice.  Anyway.  Fellas,  I gotta say,  you do a good job  over there.  I just hope  everyone's getting along.  I hope those  serious bathrooms  are clean enough  for you.  I hope at night 
[02:55:00]  you're going out  and you're having  some beverages  and you go home  to your families  because that's all  it's about.  It's also about  watching horror movies.  What?  Horror movies?  Horror movies are good.  Jesus Christ.  I like watching  horror movies  because everyone's  a fucking asshole  in a horror movie.  You can cathodically  watch them all  fucking die  in horrible,  violent ways.  So by the end,  you're tired,  you've seen a lot  that's a lot  of blood  and you feel 
[02:55:30]  pretty good.  Max,  thank you,  brother.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, guys.  A salute.  All right.  A salute.  That's the best  we got from last week.

[03:00:00]  This is Friends of the Show.  Friends of the Show.  Audio entertainment  courtesy of the people you hear  and hear about  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  This week,  Jay Morris,  more stories.  Welcome back, my friends.  More stories,  episodes,  hundreds,  something.  Duff McKagan,  hanging in there.  This is good.  Rarely do you get to talk  into a mic  sitting down.  You're probably up  with your foot up  on the monitor.  It is a little strange.  Is it really? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, my foot up  on the monitor.  I did that in like the...  Yeah, I don't do that.  That's what I would do.  Now what do you do?  You kind of lay back  or you get out of the cut  a little bit,  lay back?  Well, you know,  especially now  with internet  and photos  and YouTube  and you see yourself  and I...  like there's so...  like there's so many videos  and pictures of me  in like the two years  when things were awful  for me,  like 92, 93.  Awful. 
[03:01:00]  And that's when  most of the pictures  were taken of me  and a lot of those  are like the foot up  on the...  Was that just so you  wouldn't fall down?  Probably.  You know,  like who knows  what the hell  I was doing,  but yeah.  I heard you're really  like actually lucky  to be alive.  Is that...  Would you agree  with that assessment?  I'm fortunate  that, yeah,  I was taken to the hospital  at the time  I was taken to the hospital.  Anything you don't like,  by the way,  we pull it immediately  on the spot.  So I don't want you  to get like,  what the fuck?  No. 
[03:01:30]  You guys were touring,  I think you guys  were with Sebastian Bach.  Skidrow.  Yeah,  and Snake Sabo  is a good dude.  Yeah.  And he said,  you like hit your head  in Germany or something.  Yeah.  Is this any of this  ring a bell?  Yeah.  But the doctors in Germany  were like,  forget his head,  we don't know how he's alive,  his blood alcohol level is so,  like,  we've never seen this before.  That's a fact.  That's amazing.  I was knocked out  by this guy,  we had like a security guy  with us,  and we were at this  really nice dinner 
[03:02:00]  that Sony had for us  at this restaurant  in Berlin or Munich  or something,  and nice dinner,  and one of our  security guys  was doing steroids,  like anabolic steroids,  and sometimes you'd see him  kind of snap,  but he was my bro,  you know,  like,  but what?  At this dinner,  Ronnie,  this guy,  our friend,  this guy was with us,  our security guy.  Hold on.  Do you want that pulled? 
[03:02:30]  It doesn't matter.  Okay.  It doesn't matter.  I got your bags,  all I'm saying.  And I was,  can we swear?  Awful,  yeah.  Yeah.  I was fucking with him,  like,  but not in any overt way,  and he snapped.  He had one of his snaps,  and he headbutted me,  and I got knocked out.  Headbutt from a guy,  you're paying.  Yeah,  yeah,  we were paying him,  and he's a big guy,  and he had him  right in the temple.  That's all I remember. 
[03:03:00]  I remember seeing his forehead  coming,  and then I was out,  and then I was in the hospital,  and apparently,  I wasn't even drunk.  I mean,  my standards of being drunk.  You're standard drunk.  We were just at dinner.  You weren't duff drunk.  No,  you weren't show drunk.  No,  no,  show drunk was  just getting straight.  There's all kinds of levels here.  Like,  me really being drunk  and out of sort of control,  that was way after the show.  That was like  the next morning,  probably.  When you take this stage 
[03:03:30]  back in the day,  Guns N' Roses,  what,  because I know how much I drank,  and I know,  but stand-up comedy,  you can't,  you know,  there's a whole thing  with timing,  an incredible amount  of timing with bass,  but at least there's like  that martial stack  to sort of,  with drums  and everything around you  to sort of cushion the blow  if you fuck up.  Yeah,  yeah.  Playing bass,  it's all the kick drum.  That's what I would always follow.  Even when I wasn't thinking about it,  that's what I'd follow,  the kick drum. 
[03:04:00]  And I knew I was  a little bit too drunk  if I had to concentrate  on following the kick drum,  right?  And I remember one show,  I was never a guy  who got too drunk  to play,  ever.  I would get sort of straight  and we'd play.  And in like 92,  93,  just my,  you know,  my level of alcohol intake  was at such a place  and you know,  my,  I didn't get drunk 
[03:04:30]  on a fifth.  A fifth,  it was nothing.  You know,  that didn't get me drunk.  That got me straight.  Maybe.  Straight.  Maybe.  So you'd start drinking  like Lysol and Cipacol.  No,  I could afford  the better stuff.  Oh, sorry.  Right, yeah.  I didn't have to go for that.  Those of us buying tickets  to watch you,  we had to drink Cipacol.  Well, whatever.  We spent all our money  on tickets.  Yeah.  But yeah,  I remember one gig  in Mexico City  and it was a huge,  huge gig  and suddenly  it was time to play  and I was a little bit, 
[03:05:00]  I was a little wobbly  and I had to like sit up  and look at Matt's kick drum  the whole show  and I,  and that was kind of,  that was one of my last straws  that I really tried  to stop drinking  or taper it down  and,  but I just couldn't get  the knack of it.  So the guy headbutt you  in Germany,  you go to a German hospital.  Yeah.  Did that bodyguard  apologize to you ever?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He stayed up with me  for the next two nights  because I,  you know,  you can't go to sleep 
[03:05:30]  for more than,  Oh,  that's,  yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So,  so bad.  They got to keep you awake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I knew the best way  to keep myself awake  and so did Sebastian Bach,  which made complete sense to me.  Yeah.  I'll be awake  and we don't have to worry  about waking me up  every hour.  Let's go.  Yeah.  That's,  yeah.  But yeah,  Ronnie had to stay up with me  and,  and,  that was his penance.  That was,  you did this right.  He felt awful.  But yeah,  they took me to the hospital  and the doctor,  I get,  for whatever reason, 
[03:06:00]  they took blood  and,  and they,  and they did a thing  and they,  they could smell alcohol  and they did,  I guess,  a blood alcohol test level thing  right then and there  and they said,  he should be,  he should be dead.  His,  but I wasn't even drunk  and that's,  that's the point.  And yeah,  so I had to stay up.  I had a concussion-ish  type of thing.  Sebastian knew how  to keep you up.  Yeah.  Hey dude,  I got some flow.  He talks like that  all the time,  man.  Yeah.  So,  him and Richie Sampora  are the two,  like you are a human being.  Like I've met you 
[03:06:30]  like at our kids' school.  Yeah.  And we've had conversations  at a Starbucks and stuff  but like Isaac Sebastian Bach,  Richie Sampora,  those are like the two guys  when you meet them  and they're like,  all right,  all the time,  man.  Hey buddy,  I believe you're taking  the wheel call,  JJ,  you got it,  buddy.  Yeah.  Yeah,  I,  Sebastian is still like that.  I see him all the time  and one thing about him,  he's genuine.  Like it's,  it's the real deal.  He's a rock star.  Yeah,  I mean what you see on stage,  that doesn't change.  It's 18 in life to go. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  He needs to be admired.  I love it.  When I was on Saturday Night Live,  I was at a bar with a date  and he was there with his wife  and she was super pregnant  and he apparently had eyes  for my date  and he kept going,  hey man,  flipping his hair around.  He goes,  your girl and my girl tonight.  And his wife's literally  like drinking club soda  with lime  as he's getting pie-eyed with me  and he just said it all,  your girl and my girl tonight.  And she's nine months pregnant.  This is the craziest,  like this guy really knows  how to ball.  This is crazy.  Yeah.  I don't think people realize 
[03:07:30]  how diverse your music is.  Like Seattle,  I don't know if the average  Guns N' Roses fan listening  or Velvet Revolver fan knows  you were like a punk guy  like in Seattle.  Yeah.  You were in The Farts  and you were in like  10 Minute Warning.  Like you were a super,  super punk guy.  Yeah.  And from what I've read,  I just ingest music history  and presidential history  but it seems to me  you were like the one 
[03:08:00]  that got away  in the grunge scene.  Like when you went  to Guns N' Roses,  guys in the grunge scene  would see you in L.A.  and they'd be like,  he's in a butt rock band.  What the fuck?  Duff?  Yeah.  Like fucking Duff?  Duff fart?  But the thing here,  yes, right.  I never got the fart last night.  There was Blaine fart.  And loud fart.  There was a loud fart.  On drums.  Yeah.  Two drummers.  Then Paul Soldier on guitar.  It's great.  But you know what?  Good name though.  Johnny Thunders.  Yeah.  Paul Soldier.  Paul Soldier.  Good name.  Really good name. 
[03:08:30]  But my name was Duff  and it just kind of worked.  It worked for punk rock.  So, yeah,  I was maybe,  you know,  a year and a half,  two years older  than the rest of  like the Alice in Chains guys.  I think a year,  yeah,  a year and a half.  So I left  just a little bit earlier.  Heroin came into Seattle  in about 82  and really just decimated  the whole scene.  Guys in my band.  We were assigned  to Jell-O's label.  Was that before Uzi 
[03:09:00]  or after Uzi?  This was a 10-minute warning.  We were assigned  to Alternative Tentacles  which was Jell-O Biafra's  from Dead Kennedy's label.  We were like  slated to be the next  kind of thing.  And the heroin  came into that band  and just decimated my band.  And I was left there  kind of like in 84  at 19 going,  well,  what now?  Everybody's strung out.  And so I came to LA  September of 84  and met Slash 
[03:09:30]  pretty much  within the first week.  and Izzy moved  across the street,  Axl and Steven.  We started that band.  And it's weird.  Everyone's from like Indiana.  Like Izzy's from Indiana.  Axl's from Indiana.  Yeah, like everyone's  from like the Midwest.  You're from Seattle.  Yeah.  So you're the only guy  like with actual,  I would say,  a music pedigree  just because of location.  Right.  Like the,  whereas every bar  had,  you know,  10 minute warning 
[03:10:00]  and,  you know,  Soundgarden  that started up.  PSOL and then like  there was all these  punk bands  just going,  going,  going and going  and then you guys  just try to open for them  and get your time  and get out of there.  Yeah.  And then you meet up  with these guys  like one of the odds  two,  three out of the five guys  in Guns N' Roses  are from Indiana.  Well,  it turned out,  so it's a small world.  William Bailey  from Indiana.  Yeah.  And it turned out,  Izzy,  it was just sort of  that small world thing.  Izzy moved across the street  from me in Hollywood.  He and I started talking. 
[03:10:30]  He was down at the phone booth  across the street  in this like crappy street  we lived on.  And I saw him  and he looked like Johnny Thunders.  He looks like Johnny Thunders.  Just like him.  I'm like,  hey, dude,  I like Johnny Thunders.  Probably didn't say that,  but I feel like,  you know,  my life in,  if I look back at it,  I was dumb  at every turn of my life.  But I came up  to Izzy  and we started talking  and our punk bands 
[03:11:00]  had played a gig together  two years prior  in Hollywood  when I was on  one of my tours.  What was his punk band?  They were called  the Naughty Women  and they were cross-dressers.  Oh, it was real short.  It was real short-lived  Naughty Women.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I used to get in fights  with the audience all the time.  Yes.  They had like eight,  two months of gigs.  Wow, you know.  Yeah.  And they dressed as women.  Yeah.  And they had to like  literally swing mic stands  like,  get the fuck away.  Like, it was crazy.  And we played,  I was in 10-minute warning  and we played with D.I.  and somebody else 
[03:11:30]  at the Cathay DeGrant  and the Naughty Women.  And Izzy played drums  in that band.  You guys all played,  everybody played  each other's instruments  at some point.  This whole band  is like a really,  I don't know,  Axel's,  I don't know if he can play.  He plays piano.  Like, I personally,  oh yeah?  Yeah, it's great.  I get very sad  when a lead singer  puts on a guitar.  Like, when Mick Jagger  puts up a guitar  through Miss You,  I'm like,  no, no, no, no, no,  we're good, bro.  Like when Perry Farrell  puts it on  to do Jane Says  or Obvious, 
[03:12:00]  I'm like,  no, no, no,  we don't need it, bro.  You're good, you're good.  Yeah.  Like, any band,  like the lead singer of Live,  I'm like,  no, no, no, don't do that.  Just do I alone,  let them play.  Pre-record something,  I'm fine with it.  Yeah.  But everybody in Guns N' Roses  is like,  you play drums,  you play bass,  you play guitar,  and then Axel  actually can play piano,  you're saying.  And Izzy,  everybody played  everybody's instruments.  Well, I think it helps,  you know,  like when you're  in your teenage years  and people ask me,  like,  what did you do?  What do I do  with my youngster  to be a musician? 
[03:12:30]  Or like a kid  will ask me.  It's always good  to know how to play  at least sort of  other things.  And I grew up  in a big family,  I was the last  of eight kids,  and there was just,  there was instruments  around our house.  Yeah.  And so,  like being the youngest,  I was made to keep time,  go keep time,  or go play guitar,  here's three chords,  practice them,  now play those chords,  or play bass.  And it really helped, 
[03:13:00]  especially in Guns,  where we were writing  these songs together,  and it really helped  to know,  for me as a bass player,  to know what Stephen  was in his head  as a drummer.  Now you know  that was a fool's errand.  Well,  yeah,  not in,  that's why I said  as a drummer.  Right.  You gotta be pretty high  as you kicked out of  Guns and Roses  by Guns and Roses.  It was,  think of it this way,  you were someone's  interventionist.  Like,  as high as you were,  you were like,  Stephen,  you have a problem. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah,  it was,  it was like murderists  yelling at rapists  in jail.  Like,  you're,  you're weirder than us.  It was heartbreaking,  really,  because we had this line,  you know,  that you didn't cross,  and that was,  about being a musician.  And,  like I said,  I never got too drunk  to play.  Like,  there was a line  that you didn't cross.  And people,  think of our band  in retrospect  as these crazy motherfuckers.  Yeah,  that's how I am.  Which we were. 
[03:14:00]  But,  we were musicians first.  Yeah?  Absolutely.  And,  when did that start to,  when did,  when did the exchange rates  start to disintegrate?  Or,  or at least start to switch hands?  When did the scales  start to tip?  When,  because you guys started  coming out later and later,  making crowds wait,  right?  Maybe Axl just did it.  You guys are probably  ready to go on.  Yeah.  And this is me talking.  Lead singer syndrome  kicks in.  When does that, 
[03:14:30]  when,  around when,  does that start going on?  Well,  I know for me,  like,  like I said,  I would  get myself to be loose.  And that was something  I was used to doing  since I was like 16.  Yeah.  You know,  just getting,  once I got sober at 30,  I,  I thought I,  my,  my life as a musician  would be over  because I couldn't drink  and how am I supposed  to get loose before a gig?  And I found out soon  that that was  the dumbest thing ever. 
[03:15:00]  Like my first sober gig,  I played better  and felt more comfortable.  What was your first sober gig?  It was at the Viper Room  with Steve Jones  from the Pistols.  Yeah,  this is a crazy,  what,  the Outsiders?  Erotic Outsiders.  Great band.  Really good time.  Yeah.  You guys kicked Billy Idol  and Steve's,  you kicked it,  like they were in it  and then they were out of it?  No,  no,  we would have,  so we'd have guest singers.  Every,  we played every,  like Monday at the Viper Room  and that's how the band  kind of got started.  Right.  We played a,  the Neurotic Outsiders. 
[03:15:30]  Neurotic Outsiders.  Yeah.  So you,  Steve Jones,  like already you're like  in fantasy camp  as far as rock and roll goes.  And you're probably looking  over on the side of the stage  going,  Steve Jones.  Yeah,  no,  he's my idol.  Really?  And so Billy Idol  and his guitarist.  Well,  okay,  so it's kind of incestuous,  all of music,  it really is.  Sure.  I was in,  kind of,  writing songs  with Billy Idol  and Steve Stevens  up at my house.  I had a studio  at my house  in Hollywood Hills. 
[03:16:00]  And then this  Neurotic Outsiders thing  started.  Idol came and sang  with us a couple times.  We had like,  Billy Idol sang with us  one Monday  and then Iggy  the next Monday.  Well,  I never got a call for that.  Brian Setzer  came and played with us.  I'm ready.  I'm sorry,  I'm ready to go.  You didn't get the call.  I got the boiler.  I look like Gibby up there.  It's a big gut.  I'm ready to go.  We had Sporty,  Sporty Spice  came and sang  God's He the Queen.  Now you're making it worse.  Yeah.  But we had all these,  yeah.  She's the one that can really sing. 
[03:16:30]  She's killer.  Yeah,  she can actually sing.  She jumped into the audience  and she was punk rock.  Yeah,  she could sing.  She can crush it up.  But I missed something here,  didn't I?  Back to the,  when did it get too much?  It got too much.  You never crossed the line as a band.  Stephen crossed the line like how,  you said you guys,  the music always came first.  When as a band,  maybe not just Stephen,  but when as a band  did that start to erode a little  and when did you all,  did you all start to cross the line  at some point?  Well,  I'll speak for myself. 
[03:17:00]  I do best when I do that.  Don't we all?  Yeah.  So I,  you know,  to get loose,  it would be,  you know,  you go on stage,  we're headlining,  so your stage time is nine.  And that's what you're used to.  So I'd get myself throughout the day.  It's okay.  Nine o'clock.  I'm ready to play in all ways.  Right.  And if you're not going on till 10,  we got to kind of keep that.  It's like a sport trying to keep that level. 
[03:17:30]  So you're totally good.  By the time you hit the stage,  you're playing to a lot of people.  You don't want to feel less than good.  It's like going out and playing football,  you know,  like NFL stage is big  and you want to feel exactly right.  You wonder how those guys,  how do they feel exactly right at 1 p.m. on Sunday?  How do they feel that?  Because, you know,  instead they do steroids  and they headbutt you in the face.  Right.  Imagine if they push the game back till,  well,  suddenly now it's at three guys. 
[03:18:00]  Well,  what would happen to make that,  just plumbing something,  security,  Paul McCartney showed up,  he wants to meet everybody,  like just weird random shit happens on the road  that pushes the time of the show,  but actual late.  Yeah,  maybe some,  you know,  yeah,  I'm not,  and by the way,  during this whole time,  you don't need to air anybody out  because I think it's pretty much,  only one of you has cornrows.  Right.  So,  so,  um,  yeah,  for whatever reasons,  we started to go on,  sometimes not until midnight  or one. 
[03:18:30]  It seems to me,  I think you guys could do it  at like 89.  I think like that's perfect  when you guys went on tour  with Metallica.  Yeah,  uh,  that was actually,  I think it was like 92.  I'm saying,  I think you could have done it in 89.  Right.  And like right after Appetite  where it was just bananas.  Did you,  in that tour,  it,  it just seemed to be  like two different,  the pendulums go in two separate ways  with two monster bands.  Was there an energy 
[03:19:00]  when you guys were on stage?  Not,  it wasn't then.  Let me make a much shorter question  and more,  a little more.  Go ahead.  It seems like it would be  really fucking hard  to follow Metallica.  Indeed.  Um,  I think it,  at that point in 92 or three  or whenever it was,  we were switching off  every night.  So it would be,  we call it a co,  it was a co-headlining tour.  Frankly,  they probably wanted to go on first  for a ton of reasons.  Um,  if they go on on time. 
[03:19:30]  I always want to go on first.  Yeah,  totally.  Let's get out of here.  Yeah,  yeah,  totally.  And,  um,  and,  but it never felt like  because those,  those audiences were there,  nobody left  when somebody else went on.  And so I didn't,  didn't necessarily feel it then.  Um,  I think it was pretty bold  move by,  by both bands  to do that.  Yeah.  Um,  and,  uh, 
[03:20:00]  but going on after,  yeah,  especially like now,  you don't want to go on  after Metallica.  And even 92,  you probably didn't want to go on,  but it was like,  we were kind of a bold band.  Like,  we didn't give a fuck  about what anybody else thought.  It's like,  we just want to do something cool.  And that was cool.  And we got different bands  to,  to fill in the opening slots.  We got Motorhead.  We tried to get body count  for,  for L.A.  Yeah.  And that was when the,  the fuck the police.  Yeah. 
[03:20:30]  It was cop killer.  Cop killer and all that stuff.  Yeah.  And they were banned  from playing in L.A.  So we tried to get them to play.  How ironic is it?  Ice-T had an album,  Freedom of Speech,  just watch what you say.  And then he's banned  from doing gigs.  Yeah.  You,  you toured with,  obviously Guns N' Roses,  all right,  you did like the farts  and you do 10 minute warning.  Like that's the club scene,  scrap putting up flyers yourself,  Guns N' Roses,  you know,  incarnations of things  right before Guns N' Roses,  Guns N' Roses hits.  It's banana.  You're the biggest thing.  You are actually  the biggest band in the world. 
[03:21:00]  So you've done that tour  where you've ridden the rocket  and you've,  you've been like right there  when it's going on.  Then that ends.  Then,  then like a theater tour,  Jane's Addiction  or like a,  or like a festival tour  with like Jane's Addiction.  Did you tour with Jane's Addiction?  Did you do a couple games?  Did some shows with them.  Velvet Revolver did.  And then Velvet Revolver,  that was the only thing I was going to say,  which is like,  that's almost like the all-star game  in like basketball.  Like I look to my left,  I, you know,  Matt's back there  and Slash is over here  and I got this guy  and there's Scott Whelan. 
[03:21:30]  It's,  is it as a fan  just on the outside looking in,  I think,  wow,  there must be like  completely different energies  in those three,  just those three bands  must be three  different galaxies.  I would think Jane's Addiction  would be a little more like,  now,  I don't even know how to explain,  you explain it.  Is it?  Well,  Jane's,  like I came into Jane's  25 years.  Those guys were a band  for 25 years.  So there was a good vibe.  Because when I saw him  like in 89,  90,  92, 
[03:22:00]  like it was,  it was malevolent.  Like there was a sense of like,  Perry's going to tell us  to take the embassy  and we're going to have to take the embassy.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Like,  hey,  let's all go out on the wharf tonight  and start a riot,  riot,  riot,  riot.  And the echo never stops.  You're just tripping your eyes out like,  yeah,  let's go fucking do it.  Perry said so.  Yeah.  And they didn't like each other.  It was so palpable.  Yeah.  I saw them in,  you know,  I got,  I was fortunate enough to be,  Guns and Jane's,  Guns and Roses and Jane's Addiction 
[03:22:30]  started at the exact same time  in Hollywood.  So I got to see them  in front of,  you know,  10 people.  And they were,  they were that first record,  Jane's,  from day one.  Those crazy rocks,  everything's on Echo forever.  Music Machine in,  you know,  West L.A.  Yeah.  And just,  The Scream downtown.  And I had all bootlegs  from all those.  And I had all like,  you guys got too big.  By the time anybody bootlegged you guys, 
[03:23:00]  the ones that I bought  on like St. Mark's Place in New York,  you guys were already Guns and Roses.  They were still great and fun.  But it wasn't like you said,  10 people in Ottawa  and Perry's got the flu  and he's like,  I hope the macho man beats Hulk Hogan  tonight,  tonight,  tonight.  Just falling in love with his pedals  and fucking up his voice.  And you're like,  what's going on?  Where's the echo coming from?  This is incredible.  Or is there an echo?  Is that just him?  This guy's magical.  He's like a unicorn.  He threw wine on us. 
[03:23:30]  He's like a centaur.  He is a centaur.  Yeah.  So the different energies,  Guns and Roses,  you built it from the ground up  with guys that you've met at payphones.  So that has to be  the greatest feeling in the world.  Yeah,  and writing those songs.  And every band  has really got the greatest feeling.  But being in your early 20s  and...  And you did write  a lot of the songs,  right?  You...  Yeah.  Because David Lee Roth  sat where you were sitting  and he said,  bassists  are exceptional songwriters  because the rhythm 
[03:24:00]  for playing bass  is...  I don't...  He was,  you know...  Nice.  He said the rhythm...  Go ahead.  Bass playing is...  It just formulaically,  it lends itself...  He gave examples  of like guys,  bassists  that write all the songs.  He's probably thought this out  way more than anybody else.  David Lee Roth probably has.  Yeah,  I think he thinks a lot  about everything  just so he can't be caught short  in a discussion at all.  He's talking to us  about Buddhist monks and stuff.  He's asking me questions  about comedy.  It was pretty intense at times  where I was like,  um... 
[03:24:30]  He was trying to convince me  that all comedy...  It's timing, bro.  You know?  Yeah.  Good joke.  He was telling me all...  He really wanted to tell me  that all comedy comes from pain  and I was like,  ah,  Palisades are pretty nice.  I don't know, man.  I don't think I've ever been fine here.  It's pretty fine.  Sweet.  I'm excited.  But then he told some story  like,  I was with monks, man.  And I was like,  is there laughter in heaven?  You know what I mean?  And they stared at me  and just...  It was very odd. 
[03:25:00]  It was very odd stories.  But anybody that wants  to talk to Buddhist monks  about how stand-up comedy works  is a guy you've got to talk to.  It's fascinating.  Anywho.  Yeah.  You,  I don't think bassist...  Bruce...  What's the drummer?  Bassist's name from Iron Maiden.  Bruce Harris?  No,  that's Bruce Dickinson's a singer.  Steve Harris.  Steve Harris.  He writes all of the Iron Maiden songs.  All of it.  Stem to stern.  So I just wanted people to know  my man Duff McKagan. 
[03:25:30]  He's fucking putting pen and paper  out there  and guns and rolls  and velvet revolver.  Indeed.  Yeah.  Indeed.  The energy of Jane's  is definitely  the 25 years  of stuff  they've gone through.  And if you're walking in,  like me,  I did.  I walked into a garage  here in the Palisades,  as a matter of fact,  for the first writing sessions.  And there was like,  okay...  And I recognize it.  I'm a professional musician  and band guy.  And being a band guy  means you know 
[03:26:00]  how to dissect people,  a group of people,  four or five people.  There's the alpha.  Right?  And there's the guy  and how are we going  to make this work together?  Can it work?  And Jane's was...  Those guys are like live.  I played gigs with them  and it was so like...  Oh, this is what Jane's is.  This is a live band.  These guys actually  shouldn't even talk.  You know?  But they're good friends.  I don't mean it like that.  No, we know what you mean.  Yeah.  They're just wasted energy.  It's weird 
[03:26:30]  like seeing those guys  trying to communicate.  So even live now,  is there...  I haven't seen them  in 20 years,  but is there still  that sense of like  that odd male...  like coming on the mountain  and is that odd malevolence...  It's real.  And like Ted just admitted  and all the Nothing Shocking songs  are just off the charts.  And it's three days.  It's just like...  You see people turn  into like werewolves.  People that are like  not really into it.  You can pull clips  off of YouTube.  There's a show of them  like UC Santa Barbara  doing...  It's like a noon show 
[03:27:00]  right when Nothing Shocking  came out.  And they play Ted  just a minute.  Perry takes his dick out.  And it's a bunch of guys  with mullets  and baseball hats.  Everything you railed against  in Seattle.  Everything Nirvana  and everybody was like  these are guys  we don't want in our shows.  Yeah.  Man, that song's like  11 minutes long.  They play once  and like four minutes in  people start kind of  looking around  with that weird look  in their eye, man.  And then right when it's  dun, dun, dun, dun.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  Like people just turn  into werewolves  and they're doing cartwheels  and backflips 
[03:27:30]  like all those guys  are just like  they succumb.  Yeah.  It's like the undertow.  They're a primal band.  It's primal.  And that's what hits  the guy with the mullet  and the backwards  baseball hat.  And you know  it does.  And it's real.  So being in that band  yeah, it's different  because I wasn't  with them for 25 years.  I came in  you know  two years  three years ago  like going  okay, hey guys  let's write a dark  and dangerous record.  You know  here are my ideas.  Here's my ideas.  That's the worst guy.  Now listen to me.  Please don't interrupt.  Just let me have my 
[03:28:00]  none of that actually happened.  Here's a series of sketches  I did with an Asian man  at the Santa Monica Pier.  And David Lee Roth.  So you meet  in a garage  in the Palisades  and you meet all the guys.  Now is there  a conversation  with each other  is it one  where  is it like double dutch  where you don't even know  where you would chime in  because their communication  is so  algebraic?  It's  yeah  they can just look  at each other  and they probably  there was full sentences  and  you know 
[03:28:30]  of course  I've known those guys  for all this time.  Some of them  better than others  but  it was really  it was  it was  it was an honor  to go in  and  and I got to go play  Rock and Rio  in Madrid  they have one  with those guys  and I played  in Antwerp  another big show  and played some shows  like around town here  played some other gigs  I don't  you guys played  small gigs here  didn't you?  Roxy  and  yeah 
[03:29:00]  with the people  swinging on the chains  yeah  it was awesome  because you know  they're swinging  and the Roxy's  a low ceiling  so  and I'm a tall guy  and this girl's swinging  she's hooked up to chains  like through her back  and whatever else  and another guy's  like pushing her  and  but I gotta  I gotta play  so I'm watching this thing  and it's  like this  chick's swinging  and I gotta  kind of like  watch  so  if you're not  dodging shoes  you're dodging  bottles filled with piss 
[03:29:30]  yeah  or you're dodging  chicks on chains  I didn't dodge  a bottle full of piss  too well  in a couple gigs  I like everything  you write too  Seattle Weekly  you write good stuff  thanks  and I like the thing  about the 10 things  you learned  about doing the festival  oh right  yeah yeah  it was funny  you said  bottles of piss  people  yeah people in Europe  have perfected the art  of pissing a bottle  and throwing it  at the stage  and you guys  that are used to  looking for shoes  don't look for shoes  so much  no no  yeah yeah  bottles of piss  we're coming at you  yeah it's funny 
[03:30:00]  like yeah  I've been playing  those shows  in England  those big festivals  since the late 80s  so I knew  like the guys  before me  would tell me  like  hey mate  watch out  for the bottles  of piss  like the roadies  have been doing  Donnington  since whenever  the early 80s  and the lineups  of these gigs  you said  in the Rolling Stone  article  that you wrote  it was like  Brian Adams  and it was VIL  yeah we're doing  a gig  public image limited 
[03:30:30]  like it's the craziest  lineups  it's just time  it's just the craziest  lineups  that they have  yeah  it's really good  like you can go  to some festivals  especially in kind of  well all over Europe  and you'll get like  wow I want to see  John Spencer Blues  and I want to see  well you say  who was  there was four bands  you saw all in one day  and it ended with  John Spencer Blues  oh yeah  it was Pistols  so the Sex Pistols  yeah  John Spencer Blues 
[03:31:00]  oh John Kale  yeah  and  the Gutter Twins  which is Mark Lanigan  and Greg Dooley  from  yeah  Afghan Wigs  and Scream  and Chase  Flannigan's as good  as it gets  as good as it gets  yeah  and Gutter Twins  are as good as it gets  and I saw all those bands  in one day  like in one sitting  that's your  that's your entertainment dollar  that's great  and here like Coachella  it's like bullshit  bullshit bullshit bullshit  oh I like Black Keys  they're pretty cool  they're pretty cool  they're pretty cool  right  but no one's gonna like 
[03:31:30]  rip your fucking eyes out  yeah  feed them to you  yeah  they've mastered that over there  it just seems that they get it  you know the bands are more  like a guy like  like yourself  who you seem to know  about punk rock  to all kinds of other stuff  you could go to a festival there  and go  no fucking way  they're playing here  and  Cannonball Adderley  what up  you know  K-Po  how so  and  something  and  what  TSOL  they're still together  they're playing  very difficult  to time your mushrooms 
[03:32:00]  to festivals like that  probably  it's much easier  like you know  when the Lollapalooza  incarnations came by  yeah  and it would get shitty  and you're like  you know what  I'm just choosing ministry  I'm choosing ministry  right  or like  yeah  yeah  and one of your friends  be like  what about in living color  like  no nobody wants to pick  during a living color  what's wrong  with you  they go on second  you have like  panic attacks  over which band  and when to time it out.  It was easy when Jane's was headlining because you go, oh, we'll just go then.  But then it just got a little, like, 311. 
[03:32:30]  I don't want to see 311 at all, let alone high.  I don't really not want to see 311.  So Jane's Addiction, incredible energy, raw.  I guess, is it a, what's the difference between Guns N' Roses?  Like, Guns N' Roses, you guys were, you were, there is a bit of grunge in Guns N' Roses.  And you've got to take some credit for that.  But it's also, there's a bit of Sonic, there's a bit of the Stooges,  there's a bit of all that MC5 and all.  There's a bit of New York punk in there, too.  Like, you can hear a little Voivet and stuff. 
[03:33:00]  Like, there's influence of all that stuff because I think that's what all you guys  were always listening to and what you aspired to.  But then when you came together, you became this beautiful summer of 1988.  This is what we're doing.  Hey, guys, down the shore, I got this album.  You guys are going to blow your, it's going to be great.  But there's no way in hell, like, we made Appetite, like, we signed a deal.  We couldn't, we signed a deal that let us, we wouldn't have signed any other kind of deal. 
[03:33:30]  We signed a deal that let us do the record our own way.  Well, what happens if that deal falls through?  What would you do?  Because it was really like, this is us, and we're not going to, just to try to be commercial  or whatever.  Our band was too fuck you to ever try to be commercial.  But isn't that the grand irony of music?  Is the bands out of the most fuck you are the one, like, in my lifetime, Nirvana, Guns 
[03:34:00]  and Roses, like, Pink Floyd didn't give a shit about a single.  Like, nothing's more commercial than the Wall Tour.  Like, there's two separate guys doing Pink Floyd Tours.  They're both netting a hundred million apiece.  God forbid they get together.  Yeah, yeah, God forbid.  Zeppelin never gave a shit about it.  Like, all the bands that were like, fuck you, we do it the way we want.  Yeah.  Like, those are the ones that had somehow landed the biggest hits of my lifetime.  I think, you know, like, the timing of our first record of Appetite and, like you said, 
[03:34:30]  the summer of 88.  It actually came out the summer of 87.  It took a year for the world to kind of, like...  Well, I was born premature.  Sorry to get it.  But it did.  It took a year.  That record, we just toured to seven people for a year, you know?  Like, who'd you open for when nobody knew who you were?  The Colt, Iron Maiden, Motley Crue.  That's a band you'd want to go on after.  If you had to go on after Motley Crue, Iron Maiden, or The Colt. 
[03:35:00]  Before, before.  No, I'm saying if you had to go on after any of those three, name which ones would be easiest to hardest.  Oh, I don't think you'd want to go on after...  The hardest is...  Iron Maiden.  Yeah, no question.  Because they have those fans.  And all those bands have their fans, though.  Yeah, and they got, like, a giant puppet.  Eddie comes out, the big puppet, and they do Run Through the Hills and 6669, and he's back-to-back.  You're done.  You can't come out and go, she got a smile, and it's...  They're like, what? 
[03:35:30]  This is like a ballad.  What's happening?  You know where you are?  You're in the jungle.  No, actually, we're kind of back in the whatever that we were...  There's only one band, every musician I've ever asked,  There's only one band that can follow any fucking band on the planet.  And they're very popular.  And they've been popular for a long time.  Rolling Stones.  Two different lead singers.  No, not that.  Two different lead singers.  Very rock and roll.  Very Australian.  ACDC is the only band... 
[03:36:00]  Oh, of course, of course.  I've ever been told could follow Metallica.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Could follow the Stones.  Two-hour Stones concert.  You dim those lights and play...  And everyone's like, I don't even know what the Stones are anymore.  Fuck that.  Yeah, no, you're right.  The Zang has come out.  That's my impression of Zang's guitar.  Sorry, it took me more than just a microsecond.  Well, it's the ocean of bands.  I'm like, go ahead, pick a fish out of the ocean.  No, but you said Australia, two singers.  You're like, Bee Gees, Bee Gees.  The fucking Bee Gees, man. 
[03:36:30]  Nobody can follow the Bee Gees.  Four singers.  Yeah.  They wrote, how can you mend a broken heart?  And sang it like Muppets.  Nobody can follow the Bee Gees.  Bee Gees is actually pretty fucking good.  Pretty good writers.  But, I mean, once you hear Al Green break down, how can you mend a broken heart?  You can't go back over that bridge.  They're wearing turtlenecks.  When I think I'm doing good things.  That's a good point.  So, okay.  Velvet Revolver, by the time you start touring with them, it's got to be actually fun.  Like how it was... 
[03:37:00]  My theory on life is it's just like the first time you did a real Coke, the first time you got drunk,  the first time you got a pussy, you're always chasing the way it felt the first time.  Sometimes I come down to PCH, I look to my left, and maybe it's because I got new polarized sunglasses.  It could be something that stupid, and I'll just see like a palm tree and the ocean right there,  and I go, fuck, like this is where I live.  And it's the way I felt when I first came out here.  And the same thing when you do stand-up, when you have new stuff.  So I would guess, maybe foolishly, that as a musician, simply playing bass in a band with 
[03:37:30]  all stars in it, that's that popular, that's drawing, and it seems like that had the potential.  I would guess that would have been fun, just fucking fun, how it was supposed to have been  all along before all the wheels fell off.  Yeah, VR, Belt Revolver, Slash and I and Matt Sorm were asked to do this benefit show  down here in L.A. in 2002. 
[03:38:00]  And it was Randy Castillo, the drummer from Ozzy, had passed away, and it was money to raise,  it was to raise money for his funeral and like hospital bills.  Like, okay, yes, we'll do it.  And Ozzy's lost two, like, of the best at their position.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With Randy Rhodes and Castillo.  Yeah, yeah.  It was in Cal Ripken and Eddie Murray out of the infield.  Sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of bummed, like, fucking Ozzy, Jesus.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:38:30]  So we did this show, and it was the first time Slash and I and Matt, the three of us,  had played together since like, it's 2002, so maybe 94.  And it felt so good, like the first three chords we played together, it was...  What was the song?  I don't remember, but I just remember we went to this rehearsal place in the Valley,  and like, amps were there and drums and maybe It's So Easy.  I forget what song, we did Mama Can and It's So Easy in Paradise City, and...  Who sang?  Did you sing?  Steven Tyler sang. 
[03:39:00]  Oh.  And the guys from...  What's your next wish, Duff?  Yeah, no, it was just like all these people come together to do the show,  and then we committed to do the show, then everybody was doing the show.  So, well, I want to sing with them.  We did Mama Can, and I think he sang Paradise City, and Josh from Buck Cherry sang something  with us, and...  But you knew right when you played...  In 2002, it was like Matt and Slash, you're like, there's no reason this isn't happening. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, so we played the gig, and it was...  It was people that aren't here is the reason this isn't happening.  It just felt great.  And I had gone back to Seattle in 93, and got myself sorted out, and then met my wife.  We started having...  She started having kids.  I just watched, actually.  And then I got into school.  I went to Seattle U.  I went to business school.  And I was playing music up there. 
[03:40:00]  I played with Lanigan, and played with some guys, but I was going to school.  And if you haven't been to school since you were 15, going to Seattle U is no joke.  And just clean.  I was clean a couple years.  Yeah, yeah.  You were working a program, and then going also like...  I was doing...  Martial arts was my program.  Oh, okay.  So I was doing that every day, and we had the babies, and going to school, and I was  just figuring out how to live again. 
[03:40:30]  Like, well, what is this thing?  You know, if I'm going to go to sleep at like 11 p.m., is that what people do?  You know?  And wake up when the baby wakes up.  That's when you wake up.  Yeah.  But I was playing music, but hadn't really thought about anything else beyond just playing  in Seattle and going to school and having little babies.  And so 2002, we did the gig, and we went to lunch the next day, the three of us, Slash  and Matt and I, and maybe we should try to write some songs and see what happens. 
[03:41:00]  And one thing led to another.  We got Dave Kushner in to play rhythm guitar, and then we looked for a singer.  It took us a year, and Weiland was ready to make a big change in his life, like as far  as lifestyle-wise went, and this is 2003.  It doesn't seem like a big change, Duff, I'm going to be honest with you.  He's changed for a couple of years.  He was really, he was, he was, uh...  Because you guys, were you guys at that point all kind of pretty much had your acts together? 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  And it was an understanding, like, if you come into this band, like, we're not really  partying anymore.  We're kind of, uh, doing karate and reading the big book, like, uh, you're welcome to  join us.  Yeah, yeah.  Um, yeah, and that's what he wanted.  He had, he and I were friends besides that, and he had wanted to kind of do what I was  doing as far as Sensei Benny and, like, uh, doing martial arts and getting clean.  And he had kids, and he wanted to, um, be there as a, as dad. 
[03:42:00]  And that was, that was, okay, I can help you do that.  And, and, uh, the band thing, we started writing songs together, and it just worked.  It clicked, and we made that first record, the VR record, and everybody went out and toured  and kicked ass.  And the chemistry in that band was really good, because we were all about 40.  We, we suddenly kind of maybe had something to prove again.  Um, and, uh, we, we wrote songs out of that really cool place where, like, you gotta, these 
[03:42:30]  songs gotta be great.  They can't just be good.  They gotta be great.  You know, and, uh, the band's gotta be great, not just great.  They're gonna show up because we were great.  Right.  So let's fuck them up with shit that is great.  Yeah.  Right.  And, uh, so-  Did Izzy help write any of those songs?  He didn't.  He was around, like, he was coming around, um, when we first got together, just coming  and jamming.  He would, like, show up with a guitar and an amp, and-  I heard he's like a gypsy.  He just kind of roams the countryside every once in a while, there's a little session with  somebody. 
[03:43:00]  He-  Tap out.  He's, he's just, he's, he's been very comfortable in his own skin.  Yeah.  Um, since probably 1990, 91.  It's a guy you look at and just, as, from another guy's perspective, he's like, fuck,  I'm jealous of that guy, because he's really just comfortable wherever he's at, any situation  he's at and in.  He's a good guy.  Um, and yeah, he, he, um, can kind of just, he doesn't have any kids, and he helped raise, 
[03:43:30]  uh, a girl, uh, his girlfriend's daughter, and, and, um, he was exceptional at that.  But he doesn't really have anything that ties him to any one place.  Is he like a gypsy?  I have this beautiful-  Yeah, sure.  Ever since the Juju Hounds album, I'm like, oh, he's just like this magical gypsy, like  Jim Morrison would have thought he was the coolest guy in Laurel Canyon.  He's like, also like a centaur.  Yeah.  Um, no, he is.  He's like a, he, he, he is. 
[03:44:00]  I don't think people know that Duff McKagan was an honor student in high school, so you  can do all your rock and roll talk, mister, but Roosevelt High?  I, I was an honor student in college.  In, in, at Roosevelt High, I, um, I, I, I, I started playing in rock bands, and, um-  Well, the end.  Grades weren't, like-  Yeah, the end, that's it.  Or even going to school.  I went to an alternative school for, like, a year and a half of my high school.  Did you get a high school diploma?  I did.  Okay.  I got a GED when I was 18. 
[03:44:30]  But you didn't go up and get your diploma, like, with your friends in high school.  No, but I, I did do their, um-  But I could roll a joint while steering with my knee.  Yes.  Yes.  I did the commencement address for Roosevelt last, last spring.  Really?  Yeah, I guess a year ago, just about now.  That's fantastic.  Yeah, and so I did the thing-  A cautionary tale turned multimillionaire.  Well, I, I just told them, kind of, like, I, you know, I wrote, like, kind of like one  of my columns. 
[03:45:00]  I wrote, like, this thing, and I, I read it, and then I, kind of, dialed it in for a speaking  thing, and, um-  I'm going to get you more nervous for that than any of your last 100 gigs.  This is terrifying.  Yeah.  Terrifying.  Um, and-  No bass.  Huh?  No bass between you and them.  No, there's not.  But there was a podium.  Yeah, podiums are good.  I use them at corporate gigs, and I put little notes on the podium with, like, their names on  it, and they're like, how did you know that Mike in accounting likes to play golf?  I'm cheating, you idiot.  There's a podium.  There's a podium.  You had notes when you did the commencement address. 
[03:45:30]  I did.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  But they gave me, they gave me a, uh, after I was done, the principal came up, and he's  like, oh, thanks, that was very nice, and then, you know, like, the band did Sweet  Child of Mine, like, of course.  That's badass.  That's, that's cute, guys.  And, and, um, and then the guy gave me a letter bound, because we got something for you,  the Duff, and there was a high school diploma from Roosevelt.  So I finally, after I got out of college, I graduated high school.  Did it say Duff on the diploma, or did it say?  Yeah, Duff. 
[03:46:00]  That's, yeah, it's been my name since I was one.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  No.  Also, uh, Walking Papers, I only listened to the single, Already Dead.  I like, it's, I don't know how to explain it.  But it's, it's, it's great, it's great.  I'll explain it that way.  Yeah, there you go.  It's certainly, um, it's a different gear, but I haven't, I guess this is the best thing.  If I was a musician, I guess this is what I want, I would want to hear.  No.  It's, it's certainly a different gear. 
[03:46:30]  I haven't figured out which gear it is yet, so I, which makes me keep listening to it.  But then every time I listen to it, I hear something I didn't hear the last time.  Right.  That, that's cool, and Already Dead, that song is kind of a toned down song from, from  the whole record.  Real toned down.  Yeah, it's toned down.  But oddly metal, oddly, you know, good.  And what really struck me is the first lyric with friends like these, Who Needs Enemies,  I'm like, that could be a quarter of everyone Duff has ever known. 
[03:47:00]  Maybe all of us, so.  Yeah.  No, I think, you know, not.  I'm just more, you know, guys like you and me, Jay, maybe a bit more public than others.  Right, but I don't depend on four other guys and how they feel in their mood every night  to make my living.  Yeah.  I just go by myself.  Like, if it was the Duff McKagan band, and you could tell everybody to go kick rocks,  then sure.  Yeah.  But if you're going out on stage, it's like, all right, what is it now?  Yeah.  Is he left?  He doesn't feel like it anymore.  Steven, and this, and this guy's late, and that.  All right, you know what?  I'm going to go do my own thing. 
[03:47:30]  I'm going to go do Loaded.  Yeah.  And then every band.  What is it about bands, Duff, that they just, that when you start, this is what fascinates  me about musicians and bands.  When you're a band, when you start and it gets going, that incredible joy, the greatest  joy in life is to begin.  That's the greatest joy in life, is to realize you've really just started something.  And when you guys are playing the clubs, and then you get your record deal, you kind of  get what you want from the record deal, or else we're not going to do a record deal. 
[03:48:00]  You lay the album you want to lay down, and it comes out exactly, for the most part, how  you want it.  All of a sudden, boom.  Like, you're not opening for shit.  You're Guns N' Roses.  You're the big, like, that rocket ride.  Why can't anybody keep that together?  It just seems like, how come no one's figured out the formula for holding on to that initial  four years of joy, and just keeping it together?  I think, you know, I think some bands, like the Stones, like, have figured out how, no 
[03:48:30]  matter what's going on inside of the band, personality-wise, and business-wise, because  there's also that layer, which can be a huge layer, they figured out a way to make it  work.  I mean, we've heard the stories, they almost broke up in the 80s, they almost broke up  again, you know, in the 90s, but they've figured out...  Separate planes.  All that kind of thing, but they figured out some way.  They worked through that thing, and, you know, I've been in Guns N' Roses, we didn't 
[03:49:00]  know how to work through it, and we had a couple guys from the original band gone, so  there's that...  All of a sudden, you're a little lopsided, and we're not figuring out stuff like we used  to.  Right.  You know, everybody takes their brain.  Well, it's just their brain, yeah.  Yeah.  So, you know, I...  But I do look at it kind of the opposite way most people look at it. 
[03:49:30]  Like, I'm surprised we...  I'm surprised we...  Not surprised, but look how long we lasted, and we produced a lot of songs in that short  amount of time.  And we played some massive gigs.  And maybe that was just supposed to be the way our lot in life.  Friends of the show, this has been Jay Moore's podcast, Moore Stories.

[03:59:00]  Buckle up, bitches.  Here we go.  This motherfucker and his dick pills.  You believe this guy?  I took two different brands last week.  Why not go to a doctor and tell him your dick is broke?  Because it's not broken.  He will give you amazing drugs.  I'm not saying that it's broken.  I'm saying tell the doctor it's broken.  Do they have a test, though?  Does he rub it?  They're like, you're lying.  He sucks your cock for five minutes, and if you can think of dead puppies for five minutes, then he'll give you the pills.  Yeah, they can't say no, can they? 
[03:59:30]  There's no way for them to test that.  Of course they can't say no.  No, they stimulate your prostate with a large three-finger death grip, and then if you get hard, they don't give you the pill.  I'm not there.  They can't, obviously.  I mean, they're going to take your word for it.  Why would you say that you can't get hard if you could get hard?  Well, you wouldn't lie about that, would you?  Nobody breaks their dick with that stuff, do they? </pre>
