<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show, airing Monday, May 19th, 2014, began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts recapping Friday's "Super Show."  The Super Show featured a red carpet event with recurring callers and personalities like Oscar, Stalker Patty (who delivered a chilling Marilyn Monroe impression), Lady Die (who infamously clogged a Starbucks bathroom), magician Bobo, stand-up comedian Big A (whose stuttering routine Opie later posted online), and Sandy Kane (who demanded $1000 for her appearance in a "geriatric stripper outfit"). Colin Quinn and Dennis Falcone (the show's DJ, who had issues with his custom audio drops, particularly the "self-sucking DJ" phrase) were also present.  The pre-show also discussed the hosts' hearing problems, the upcoming California Chrome horse race (and the nasal strip controversy), and a young boy switching a foul ball.  Other topics briefly touched upon were a Michael Jackson hologram performance at the Billboard Music Awards, a 9/11 Memorial gift shop, a NYC cab driver with a Nazi armband, Vince McMahon's financial losses, and a caller from Scotland discussing the upcoming independence vote.

The main show extensively covered the Billboard Music Awards, criticizing Five Seconds of Summer's image and mocking Kendall Jenner's teleprompter struggles.  The Michael Jackson hologram sparked debate about its authenticity.  Lorde's appearance prompted harsh criticism of her looks.  Further discussion included Vince McMahon’s losses, a caller's graphic account of a horse's erection, the movie *Neighbors*, and the hosts’ small residual checks from past projects (including one from *Mod Squad* for Richard Pryor).  The Michael Jackson hologram discussion continued throughout the show.

Another segment began with anecdotes about Jamaica Station on the Long Island Rail Road, followed by more discussion of the Michael Jackson hologram (including Bonnie Fuller from HollywoodLife.com's call-in).  This transitioned to a discussion of Preakness-winning horses and a call with a farrier detailing graphic experiences with stallions.  After a mysterious break (with suspicion of "Fake Roland" involvement) and commercial breaks, the hosts discussed the 9/11 Museum gift shop, expressing disgust at the merchandise and debating its appropriateness, with numerous callers joining the conversation.  The segment concluded with more discussion of Vince McMahon's losses and reminiscing about a former staffer nicknamed "Spaz." The Rock's past appearance on the show was also mentioned.

A subsequent segment focused on the WWE's falling stock price after Mick Foley's merchandising deal ended.  The hosts made tasteless jokes comparing the stock's decline to Owen Hart's death, acknowledging their inappropriateness.  The segment involved wrestling-themed puns, criticism of Mark Cuban and Kevin O'Leary's Billboard Awards appearance, a discussion of Paul Orndorff's arm condition, and observations about insensitive public apologies.  Pat Oswald joined the show in studio, discussing online criticism and "white knighting."  A bit about a giant mosquito in Queens concluded the segment.

A comedic bit featuring a fictional "doctor" making offensive ethnic jokes followed.  This transitioned to a conversation with Patton Oswalt, who discussed the Webby Awards and nominees (Charlie Rose, Fred Armisen, Patti Smith, Natasha Lyonne, George Takei, and Tim Berners-Lee). Oswalt shared a cat video and discussed online content and clickbait.  A highly graphic and vulgar bit with a painted object called "TWATO" ensued, followed by more conversation with Oswalt about his career, including anecdotes about Rich Voss.

The final segment featured Oswalt as a guest, continuing with off-color jokes and discussions about the Webby Awards,  the Michael Jackson hologram (comparing it to Tupac's hologram), and other explicit topics, including a heated and offensive exchange between caller Big D from Kentucky and Sal. The post-show with Sam Roberts followed, praising Oswalt.  The conversation circled back to the Billboard Music Awards and the Michael Jackson hologram, interspersed with more advertisements.  Numerous explicit sexual references and racial slurs were made by callers throughout the show.

[00:02:00]  cleanse our palate a bit but there is no denying what went down on friday was classic opie and anthony  i mean there is evidence on getty images about how classic it was getty images which is a service  that provides members of the media with photos of celebrities chronicled everything that went down  on friday's show let me go to the phones and we start with todd in burlington i think uh sal by the way 
[00:02:30]  is documenting what's going on in the studio today during the pre-show and uh you can see the  documentation for yourself at ona show on twitter we're already starting the tweets what's up todd  super sam roberts todd from burlington here how are you good buddy how are you hey i'm slightly fired  up but i gotta say in all honesty if you look back at friday's show it was a show it was good but  i don't think it was as super as we wanted it to be well i don't know the expectations for super 
[00:03:00]  shows are always weird uh people get tired of hearing the members of the super show throughout  the weeks leading up to these things but there's something about a super show the aura the vibe  that leads people to think it's going to be incredible and sometimes people's expectations  aren't met and sometimes they are and sometimes people just want to drive off a bridge to stop  themselves from having to listen to the idiocy that we're broadcasting either way and maybe some 
[00:03:30]  of it was visual because before the show travis and me were talking about the talent that bobo came  out with it's also the super shows tend to be exhausting for the hosts uh and we'll we'll get into exactly  why that is so so so some of that the fatigue sets in i think with the host and the listeners  after uh four hours of super showness but i was uh i was uh uh i thought it was a pleasant experience  for everybody red carpet coverage is what began the super show on friday we asked all the members 
[00:04:00]  the super show is what we call the shows where we just invite all of the weirdos that come in  and take part in the opian anthony show your lady dies your uh stalker patties your big a's we invite  everybody in and we try to find some activities for them to do uh it's getting a little more  difficult as these super shows go on this was super show three but we laid out the red carpet  we set up a step and repeat we invited the paparazzi to come be a part of it and uh and we had some red 
[00:04:30]  carpet coverage we'll listen to a little bit of that here is oscar making his return to the  olby and anthony show beloved character on ona uh oscar walked the red carpet on friday  our correspondent on the red carpet sam take it away and please introduce all our guests  well thank you self-sucking denny falcon we are out here no no no no no no no he doesn't do that  he doesn't like that we're out here on the red carpet and the stars are already starting to shine

[00:06:30]  week actually i was in hoboken right all night just fucking partying it up man i was dancing with  every single girl they were on it you know by themselves on the dance floor it's great it was  great this sounds just like uh when brad pitt hits the uh red carpet the question on everybody's  mind is any of those girls the one oh hell no man it's awful stuff well thanks oscar for stopping by  wow i'll show him off to get his official picture in front of the step it's amazing the flashes i see 
[00:07:00]  going off that was oscar on the red carpet we had oscar stalker patty lady die bobo big a mike  bachetti sandy kane everybody dennis of course was controlling the music for the red carpet coverage  and if you could see super show aside the glare that eric is burning into sal right now sal i guess  was taking photos of eric there's a lot of ass grab going on grab ass i guess there's a lot of grab 
[00:07:30]  ass going on uh behind the scenes here as the pre-show rolls on eric are you mad because sal was  taking photos of you putting uh uh what is it called valencia orange no but what what is the uh  the the the extra stuff that you put in your water what do we call it uh enhancements water enhancements  sure sal caught eric putting some of his treats inside of his water and uh he decided to he decided 
[00:08:00]  to tweet that out it's harmless it's just a nice tweet right and eric is very pissed about it but you  can go to on a show on twitter and see why uh eric can't stand sal right now uh joe joe the trucker  hey sam robert what's up buddy um how's your weekend my weekend was good  friday's show is just a catastrophe  um couple points here yeah first off sandy kane looks like a walking scrotum she's all deflated and 
[00:08:30]  shit it's kind of scary looking well i did see that uh sal was tweeting a lot of photos  from the super show as it went on i will say that he's a very handsome dude all right i mean i guess  that's cool fine um but i was looking at uh the reddit subforum the opian anthony reddit subforum  and they were all in agreement that the photo that sal took of sandy kane's sandy kane's armpit  that you can see on ona show on twitter was probably the most disturbing i think all of her is just 
[00:09:00]  disturbing and then seeing um that bitch's tits just ruined everything completely well of course  you're talking thanks buddy about uh lady die who uh was part of the red carpet coverage uh we found  out even before because lady die if you don't remember from her internship or quote-unquote  internship uh is banned from using the bathrooms up here at sirius xm so she has to be walked 
[00:09:30]  when she needs to use the restroom she showed up at about 5 30 6 o'clock in the morning  on friday because an intern had to drive her here she couldn't be relied on to get on the train  uh and before the red carpet coverage even started lady die had already clogged up the  starbucks bathroom we got into that with her uh as part of the red carpet coverage let's go to track  four sal the beauty just continues lady die do you have a moment arrived all the time in the world 
[00:10:00]  patty already said that but ask her about the clogged toilet please yes the question on everybody's  mind breaking news today you broke a toilet in starbucks correct not did it flush is the question  you went down and did you make a number one or number two this morning i made a number two okay  that thing in my face i made a number two and uh and did we flush it all the way down be honest yes  we did we flushed it all the way down or i tried to anyway oh boy that's not good well then it didn't 
[00:10:30]  go down three times she said three times wow what happened was it a big one was it it was it a nice  big hefty uh dump yes like an anaconda all right ask me if it was soupy or solid else the people want  to know lady die everybody's wondering uh people magazine's been reporting but nobody knows for  sure was it soupy or solid the dump it was solid okay just keep asking your dumb questions just keep 
[00:11:00]  going now the other question that's on everybody's mind was uh beyond consistency color are we thinking  green brownish darker was it a tar color the dump we're talking about brown a light brown a dark  brown light brown okay how many pieces was it oh and the people wanted well the people are wondering  here on the red carpet for the super show how many pieces exactly was it i don't know an estimate i  don't know come on we can't publish i don't know the people want to know three three pieces three 
[00:11:30]  big pieces and how many times oh sorry how many times did you try to flush it now you you tried to  flush it how many times three times and when we call you how many natty ices have you usually had  i didn't have any natty ices three is the answer you kind of go with that number a lot  now was it the problem with the flushing was it the length of the bowel movement or the thickness  good question okay that's it a giant it's just a big fucking prolapsed ass doesn't have any 
[00:12:00]  fucking like like uh tightness to it well yeah she she took in the ass for the entire 80s decades  questions are coming in via twitter of course lady die is trending yes uh for our red carpet show here  and they want to know is the reason that the thickness of the bowel movement was there did that  have anything to do with spending the 1980s uh having anal sex no i don't think so i don't think  so that was a long time ago and that was it and does the anus expand or is it always kind of just 
[00:12:30]  wide i don't know well i mean it's your it's your anus i don't know why do you ask me questions like  that that's what the people want to know getting to the bottom you know i'm listening back to this and  i wasn't sure about it when i was first doing it out there on the red carpet but seacrest better watch  his ass because i feel like somebody at e probably heard that and said this is the guy  that we need asking all the important questions when we cover the big red carpets uh let's go to 
[00:13:00]  snowy my buddy snowy in michigan what's up good morning samuel good morning buddy i have to call a  little shenanigans on the actual talent competition if you don't mind sure now at the beginning we're  told that oscar is supposed to do freeform rapping correct uh-huh he picked up a guitar and sang  which is what he normally does anyway isn't it that is yeah oscar was asked to uh freestyle rap  because he's so nervous but then he just picked up a guitar and then in all fairness to oscar  very nervously sang a song but you know what the problem was uh sandy kane was brought on as a judge 
[00:13:30]  so when when sandy kane's making the decision what are you going to trust yeah exactly i do get a  kick out of my mouth oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah yeah hell yeah hell yeah oh no yeah yeah we'll hear uh  oscar clips in a few minutes thanks snowy uh dan in pennsylvania uh yeah morning sam roberts  morning uh the the talent show was rigged or something because big a was phenomenal and he did  not get any notice at all i was very unhappy well we're going to listen to big a's talent uh in just a 
[00:14:00]  few minutes here on the pre-show but if you want to see big a's talent for yourself obie tweeted out  a video over the weekend obie videoed big a's stand-up he did stuttering stand-up and uh he was  phenomenal i thought but the video of it is i mean it's really creepy and i love big a he's a wonderful  dude yeah obie's cinematography is really unflattering a lot of close-ups a lot of low angles 
[00:14:30]  but uh there's video now of big a doing stand-up i hope i can only hope that we post some video of  bobo doing magic because i feel like that was maybe a little visual for people but that was a favorite  of everybody behind the scenes here at the opie and anthony show uh let's continue on and and of  course a lot of stuff going on today i saw obie was live tweeting the billboard music awards  you see that's a creep speaking of creepy and how creepy the big a youtube video is the michael 
[00:15:00]  jack i'm so the holograms are just getting creepy like and i i don't know why everybody is still  amazed at these hologram performances but there was a michael jackson hologram performing last night at  the billboard music awards i'm sure that we'll get into uh what the guys think of that but if i were  recording artists now i'd be like god damn it it used to be a thing where if somebody died  make some room for somebody not now his hologram gets to go on tour it really is ridiculous that 
[00:15:30]  the the promoters that took advantage of michael jackson for his entire life are going to get to  keep making money off of him now that he's dead because they'll just keep pushing this hologram  out on stage uh but let's get back to what we were talking about before and the red carpet coverage  of uh of the super show we move on to colin quinn now the super show was supposed to take place  tomorrow originally that was the date but we moved it specifically so we could have colin quinn in 
[00:16:00]  studio for it colin quinn he's the guy who likes to get all of these people going he plants ideas in  lady die's head he plants ideas in bobo's head he plants ideas in sandy cane's head and then he steps  back and he steps away and lets us have to deal with the chaos so we wanted to make sure that he  was in studio to witness all of the chaos uh and this was colin quinn's red carpet arrival colin quinn  is here colin uh are you excited as we all are for the super show well yes i really am this should 
[00:16:30]  be a big event um it's big every year and uh how did he come in from s-i-n-y and so did so did  i guess yeah die is outside the city the effort it takes to get in here from satan island lady die  is still gripping your shoulder that's fantastic she looks lovely i love him she looks lovely now  what you may not know colin if you haven't been watching our red carpet coverage earlier is that  lady die has already clogged up the starbucks toilet this morning  no i don't mind you've already clogged the starbucks toilet stop stop with that 
[00:17:00]  get out of the way before you hit the uh yeah yeah but i don't know what i mean  we don't want those ugly buddies happening again  no i know you didn't clog it up of course not it was three solid logs we found out  lovely she's going with a kind of a rip tail or elizabeth tail thing  and what you can see if you like skin you can see a little stomach  that's the way keep them guessing  our stomach is busting out of our buttons  colin who are you wearing um i think this is uh banana republic i could be wrong but 
[00:17:30]  and mike mike facetti where did you get your pants from  a casual fat guy i think a fat fuck  again again  the joke didn't work the last five times  right  well uh colin uh everybody's headed inside uh you're ready to head in yes i am ready 
[00:18:00]  all right next to him  everybody's not quite ready for you  yeah not yet  not yet  it'll just be colin going in  the whole time the whole show went on  lady die was just touching colin quinn  she had her hands on his shoulder  she was stroking his arm it was really quite disgusting  i don't know how colin put up with it  um but uh then the question on everybody's mind  would sandy kane show up  last we heard sandy kane called me and said she would only do the show 
[00:18:30]  if she got one thousand dollars cash  uh there is no way we were giving sandy a thousand dollars cash  and once you give sandy kane a thousand dollars cash  then bobo asks for a thousand and uh stalker patty asks for a thousand  and lady die asks for a thousand  we're not made of money here at the opian anthony show  so i had to get on the phone with her  i had to convince her that this was a good idea for her career  i had to talk her into it  finally she showed up and here it is 
[00:19:00]  the return of sandy kane as she walks the red carpet  i'm here i showed  you did show indeed who are you wearing  who am i wearing that's exactly right  who am i wearing what do you mean who am i wearing  american doll place  how are you  hello can you say fuck  hey can you say fuck  yes  all right good  fredericks of douglas  where did you get your outfit from i think is the question  um hollywood hollywood hollywood boulevard has the best strip clubs 
[00:19:30]  is that in los angeles  yes l.a  oh yes  where they need the rain  oh man  how about thanks for inviting me to uh the red carpet  yeah  of course well it's a big super show  the red carpet extravagance is a part of it  lady die was talking to us earlier about how she's clawed the toilet  don't lose your hat sandy  unfortunately i wasn't in it  my red bush matches the red carpet  your red bush funny you should mention it  host of opian anthony anthony cumia  has just been talking about wanting to see 
[00:20:00]  a big red bush  oh wow  i mean and maybe that's something  two girls like a tuesday afternoon  maybe that's something to look forward to later  maybe uh anthony gets to see that big red bush  anthony was trying to avoid and he did avoid seeing sandy canes apparently big red hairy bush  uh what people don't realize maybe is that that red carpet was happening in the hallway outside the studio 
[00:20:30]  which meant that everybody just walking around serious trying to go to work had to deal with sandy cane in her uh geriatric stripper outfit shouting fuck at the top of her lungs for the entire morning it's ridiculous the things we get away with here let's go to borgata ray in new jersey what's up ray  and the super show it was awesome last week i loved it and i got an idea for the uh super show concept i think it's time to take it on the road you guys all up on a stage someplace that serves alcohol strippers on stripper poles on each corner it can be amazing somewhere in new york new jersey the live crowd i think you guys need to do it 
[00:21:00]  i mean you're you might be right borgata ray we decided to up the ante by adding a red carpet to this event i don't know what we can do next time to make this show more super than it already is uh and it may be taking it on the road today is going to be an amazing show we got a lot to get into um as i said michael jackson hologram at the uh billboard music awards there's also some telepompter teleprompter problems for kendall jenner uh also 
[00:21:30]  ant tweeted out this amazing speaking of ant's twitter but there's a a bunch of photos from the super show on ant's twitter they're on his phone he created a whole photo bucket album with his amazing camera that he's been bringing in studio but those pictures are worth checking out he also tweeted a video of a karaoke version of chop suey by system of a down it's incredible if you haven't seen it you have to see it uh and of course the stories that broke over the weekend uh jim was tweeting a ton 
[00:22:00]  about the fact that there's a gift shop at the 911 memorial uh and a lot of people are talking about that and the cab driver that's been i think suspended at this point probably will get fired for driving around new york city with a nazi armband uh around his arm i could see where people might have a problem with that but i'm interested 
[00:22:30]  in the take opie and anthony will have on it you heard the music playing while we were doing red carpet coverage for the super show on friday that was dennis falcone dj dennis falcone was in studio all show long uh providing the tunes that we needed for the super show although  there was some production lovingly created for him that he had some issues with let's go to track 13  all right we're back thank you dennis falcone colin quinn in studio we're about to get the uh the talent 
[00:23:00]  portion of the super show going here denny didn't like that production why don't you like the production  pieces i i ask you to do one thing and don't do that anymore because it bothers me wait could you replay  that no you don't have to replay it what part take that card out and erase it but i don't know what part  bothered you just the whole thing about the implication about that we got one of the great  voice guys around here to you know to do some nice stuff for you and you're mad can i hear that i didn't  hear it yeah please now back to the opie and anthony super show that sounds great here's your self-sucking 
[00:23:30]  dj we didn't say it didn't sound good it's about the text i didn't like he's got a great voice  self-sucking dj now i'm embarrassed because i don't do that i can hardly walk you think i could  bend my legs to do that come on oh so you've tried that no i've never tried that i understand  were you all right with the other two everything was wonderful okay good oh so you like the other  one what was the other one yeah welcome back to the opie and anthony super show 
[00:24:00]  that's nice here's house dj tinkle lord dennis falcon you can just cut that tinkle lord  wow that's brutal you said you like the other one i just liked it to that point i think we  actually like every dj has drops to shout your name out while you're performing i think we got  some drops for him if he wants to do you have dennis falcon is in the mix self-filating on you 
[00:24:30]  bitches oh nice you can just edit to that's pretty cool though you're in the mix with dennis  falcon sucking himself oh it's that last part danny wow it's beautiful the production value is very  nice you talk about how magic is being that's not producing these studios i think that's a lot of  magic right there you think that's a lot of magic yeah yeah yeah the last part is what's offensive  colin was right i guess i didn't realize when we were putting that together that last part could 
[00:25:00]  be deemed offensive but i'd always thought dennis was very proud of the fact that he could do that  uh obviously not he said that was the one thing that bothers him and somehow in all the time that  he's been a part of the opie and anthony show he hasn't figured out that the one way to get them to  stop is not to say this is the one thing that bothers me i thought it sounded very professional  i thought it really amped up his performance but uh dennis didn't like it we were talking about  creepy stuff that went down on the super show i thought that this went kind of unnoticed because 
[00:25:30]  of everything that was going on around it that's why i wanted to revisit it today on the pre-show  stalker patty doing marilyn monroe's happy birthday was i mean we talk about douche chilling it was among  the most bone chilling moments that have ever happened on the opie and anthony show i swear to  you i had nightmares all weekend about this performance it was something out of a horror  movie stalker patty uh asked to do impressions as her talent and she came to me and said you know 
[00:26:00]  what i'm gonna do i'm gonna do marilyn monroe singing happy birthday to john f kennedy i said you  are she said yes i think i can really pull it off well i said that's perfect stalker patty  why don't you do it and this is what she left us with before we judge i think she has one more  impression oh you do just one more yeah all right in 1963 in may on john f kennedy's birthday in  madison square garden an actress stepped up to the podium and sang happy birthday to john f kennedy 
[00:26:30]  it would be less uncomfortable if you did november 22nd of 63 64 his birthday's in may anyway  so marilyn monroe stepped up and very gingerly went up and sang happy birthday to you  happy birthday to you happy birthday mr president comes off more like mrs vorhees 
[00:27:00]  happy birthday to you i think that sounded like what marilyn monroe would sound like if she sang it  today uh you could also hear in the background uh sandy kane it is just making just laughing 
[00:27:30]  those are sandy kane's laughs by the way this is the terrors that we deal with in studio let's go to  jimmy in east rockaway what's up jimmy yeah how you doing i just want to know what time it was  jimmy it's uh 27 after the hour only three minutes before opie and anthony take the airwaves  thank you thank you for keeping it alive jimmy real quick while we still have time uh big a doing  stand-up i told you i'd get to it there's a video online on op radio on youtube if you want to see it

[00:34:30]  Thank you. 
[00:35:00]  Thank you. 
[00:35:30]  Thank you.  Through 55-gallon drums and whiffle ball bats.  You push it in until you're comfortable.  From mayors to mayors.  It was an April Fool's hoax by two radio disc jockeys.  Bottle rockets and bra bombings.  And wieners and pigs.  Hoping Anthony got their hands on the photo and tweeted it.  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any.  Well, these people will definitely stop.  Guaranteed.  Lift off the cocks. 
[00:36:00]  They've met friends along the way.  Jim Norton.  And through fines, scandals, suspensions, cancellations, and terminations, it's the one show that remains unscathed.  Striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere comes a radio show that after 20 years remains above all else.  Real. 
[00:36:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning, everybody.  Lordy, lordy.  We are live.  Yes.  People were confused.  It's May 19th, 2014.  They were so confused as to when we are going to be off, vacation, days off, whatever.  A big concern.  Oh, big concern.  A big concern in the Twitterverse. 
[00:37:00]  You know, Twitter, a shitty place to be.  Yeah.  Man, you turn that Twitter off and you go outside, you realize life is good.  Society's gutter.  Society is pretty damn good when you get off to Twitter.  Yeah.  Um, but yeah, we're here for two days and then we go away for a week and then we come  back for two days.  Nice.  And then, of course, people...  What are you on Howard's schedule now?  I wish.  Is my mic low?  Yeah, thank God. 
[00:37:30]  I don't know what the listeners are saying.  Yeah, but something happened...  It seems very low, like I turn up...  And then there was...  What's going on?  And then, uh, the whole system crapped out during the intro.  You know that, too, right?  Oh, boy.  How's that?  Uh, well, that sounds...  I gotta crank you, though, man.  I guess.  Yeah.  Check one, two.  Check one, two.  That's interesting.  Check one, two.  Mm-mm.  Yeah.  Check one, two.  Sounds better now in my headphones.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  Because everything was real loud, but I was low, and then if I turn myself up to where  I'm loud, then everything's really loud.  Oh, boy.  It's bad enough when I try to sleep at night and I'm hearing...  Every time you bring that up, I get scared, because we've been at this a long time, and  I've actually done more radio than you.  Yeah.  And then I start thinking, okay, that has to be from the years I was in the band.  Yeah.  And tin knocking.  Well, my thing is, I went out to dinner on, uh, what day was it?  Saturday, I guess. 
[00:38:30]  And in a loud restaurant, I just sit there like a fucking mute kid.  What are you saying?  I just sit there and nod a lot.  And the specials today are...  Surprise.  Surprise.  Surprise.  Surprise.  Surprise.  Surprise.  Surprise.  Surprise.  And I'm like, oh, I don't know what they're saying.  But it doesn't make sense.  Then I could hear, like, someone across the room, like, my ears are just out of tune or  something.  Certain frequencies, you'll pick up other ones that are gone.  It's just ridiculous.  Would you like to hear our specials?  Yes. 
[00:39:00]  I just, I just, I just stare right at their lips and then I go, I think I could lip read.  I saw pork chop.  And then you hear, like,  It's just rummish.  Sermon.  Sermon.  Sermon.  I'm stinking today.  It's a rummish.  Sermon.  Well, we pop lamb chops.  The soup of the day is...  It's gibberish.  It's gibberish.  That happens to you?  Yes.  So I hope you fuckers appreciate us. 
[00:39:30]  We've sacrificed our ears.  Because when we get into our later years, we're not going to be able to hear nothing.  I can't hear.  What did he say?  Everyone on those, all the old guys in those hearing aid commercials are always angry.  Yeah.  You know, I understand.  You can't hear.  Oh, I just.  She's giving the specials.  What did she say?  Right.  All angry.  All angry.  I can't hear.  I think it's a pretty good thing, you know, you can't hear, though.  Sometimes.  Sometimes it is. 
[00:40:00]  I know some relatives of mine that have used that in the past, like old uncles and stuff that are hearing aids.  And you see him, like, when the women get yapping around the room, he just kind of goes behind his ear and turns it down.  I'm waiting for the hearing aids to be, you know, just nothing.  Just implanted in your ear.  And then I'll go.  Yeah.  Because a few people have said, you might want to.  Oh, you might want to.  Oh, fuck.  Holy shit.  But I can hear in general. 
[00:40:30]  It's just when I'm in those restaurants with a lot of people.  Oh, boys.  But I think that's hard for everybody, right?  I think so.  It's kind of goofy.  Well, probably not, you know, some fucking kid.  I hear everything.  Great.  Good for you, you little fucker.  Yeah, we will be playing the Kendall Jenner thing, Sam.  I saw that.  What is that?  I saw some of the billboards, and the hologram was just fucking freaky.  Oh, yeah.  And just imagine what that technology is going to be in another few years.  But anyway, really fast before that. 
[00:41:00]  So one of my greatest pet peeves is you get into a situation.  I have a pet beeve.  A restaurant.  So stupid.  That made me sick.  A restaurant, a bar, a lounge area, and you're sitting down.  Everything's good.  You're having a nice conversation.  Everything's perfect.  And then they decide they've got to turn the music on.  Oh, yeah.  And it has to be just a little too loud.  Just a tad.  And the next thing you know, your just comfortable situation where you're just settling in and 
[00:41:30]  you're all happy about is now just a nightmare.  Now it's a chore to try to discuss things.  Christ.  It's like we didn't need music at this point.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Is that why you sleep with TV on?  Because you can't hear that noise?  For the most part.  Yeah, because I got that stupid tinnitus.  They can't fix that?  I guess not.  Maybe I should go check it out.  You should have it checked out.  It's been there forever.  You never know what they can fix.  And I've read a lot of stuff about it. 
[00:42:00]  And it's like, sometimes it could be made a little better.  And then it's always iffy and on and off.  Like it could get better for like a month or even two months.  And then it comes back again.  What is it?  It's like the nerves in your ears kind of picking up these phantom noises.  Whoa.  Like a hiss.  A ring.  A buzz.  Whoa.  It changes.  Yeah.  What do you guys think about Scottish independence? 
[00:42:30]  I know we're being heard around the world now.  I mean in small pockets.  Let's not brag too much.  But we've got a lot of countries listening to this show these days.  Yeah.  You know, I'm like 20.  20 in this country.  Right.  50 in this.  But I don't know about Scottish independence.  I liked Braveheart.  That movie was good.  Do you know about Scottish independence?  Braveheart's all I really know about Scottish independence.  Well, this guy's calling from Scotland.  Will.  Of course it's Will.  Will.  All right. 
[00:43:00]  Hi.  Will.  All right, boys.  Hey.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I love it.  Did we do that right?  Hey.  I love a good accent.  No.  Not really, no.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I tried.  I believe in your independence.  I love you.  I want to marry you.  That's all we know.  So you actually gave a shit or not?  I gave a shit.  I don't know.  Yes.  Are you guys the one?  What's going on?  Wait, I need to ask.  Are you the guys that say con a lot?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:43:30]  We have the fucking term of India.  Yeah, okay.  You are one of those places.  They'll love it.  Ah, you're the cunt, Mom.  Happy Mother's Day.  Right.  It's fine, Jimmy.  It's fine, John.  So what's going on?  What happened?  England's still fucking...  Longshank's still fucking with you?  Yeah.  What are we doing over there?  That David Cameron boy's shatting us for a fucking...  I don't know.  I love it.  It's a large vote.  Yeah?  So what happened?  You guys got your independence?  No, we're voting September, I think, or October. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  The patches are going to be trying to go independent.  Yeah.  I'm trying to lay up a cigarette.  You might want to vote.  Yeah.  So anybody over there in Scotland...  Do you want to vote independence?  I don't know.  It's fucking on the fence.  I don't know whether you boys give a shit about that.  If you even knew it was going on.  I have no idea.  I'm trying.  I love it.  I feel like I'm back in that restaurant.  I just hear it.  The specials.  You want to hear the specials?  I'm sure.  Well, are they under English rule?  Sorry?  I'm mad about the fucking truck going past. 
[00:44:30]  Okay.  Are you under English rule there?  Kind of, aye.  Most of our laws are done in England now, so I think we'll try to get independence.  We can actually make our own fucking laws.  All right.  So most of the laws are made from England, huh?  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  We get fairly shattered.  Do you still look at William Wallace like, yeah, that guy's cool?  Not really, no.  To be honest, I've never actually seen Braveheart all the way through.  What?  It's pretty goddamn good.  What's wrong with you? 
[00:45:00]  I like the part where he throws the son's boyfriend out the window.  It's hilarious.  Whee!  I don't know if you're in the middle of public.  Yeah?  I don't know.  I love it, though.  Just agree.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I agree with that.  I agree.  I don't know if you give a shit about it.  I don't even notice what's going on.  I don't know if you boys are...  Good, we're doing good.  ...to the rest of the world sometimes.  I was hoping that...  I hope you get your independence.  After they released that Lockerbie guy, the bomber from Scotland, I think England had 
[00:45:30]  something to do with that, so I remember being very irritated with England.  They released him because they thought he was going to die in six months.  I think the boy's still ticking.  Yeah, he's still going.  He's still going?  Oh, yeah, he's still alive.  No.  Yeah.  Still alive.  Wow.  He's in my ass.  Wow.  That doesn't seem right.  No.  So, yeah.  I have one more quick question for Jimmy as well.  Sure, sir.  Okay.  I was wondering, do you consider me bringing back the advice show?  Listen to half the schmucks on that show. 
[00:46:00]  Maybe feel a wee bit better about myself.  Yeah, it's coming back.  It looks like we're not sure the exact date.  Probably before the summer.  Very soon.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I know you do your own other shows somewhere.  Yes.  Listen to you guys on the YouTube when I get a chance.  Thank you, sir.  Yes.  I don't think we can get serious over here, right?  I'll be announcing it soon once I know the exact date, but before the summer.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks, fella.  All right, Will.  All right, cheers.  Did he really?  This is how dumb we are.  What?  He died two years ago.  Thanks, Travis.  I thought, and I was too scared to challenge you on that. 
[00:46:30]  No, I felt like you died.  I really thought he was still alive.  I know he lived way longer than they were thinking, but I thought he finally left us.  Well, thank you, Travis.  All right, boys.  All right.  All right, goodbye.  Free freedom!  All right, Will.  Shut up your ass.  I think he said shove it up your ass.  Oh, that was it?  Did you say shove it up your ass?  Yeah.  Oh, see, I got that one.  Sounded like, still love you, Ant.  But I think that's good. 
[00:47:00]  I think that's good when they say showed up your ass.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  In that country, I think that's really good.  Another term of endearment, I think.  I believe, but I'm not sure.  So are we going to get a triple crown?  Yeah, I guess...  That Belmont, though, is always a tough one.  Belmont's very, very difficult.  Tough track.  And a lot longer, right?  Yeah, it's a very long race.  It's a longer run.  That's why there haven't been many triple crown winners.  But we got the first two.  Kentucky Derby and then the Preakness over the weekend.  California crown.  California crown. 
[00:47:30]  Might not run in the Belmont because of the nasal strip rule.  Really?  Yep.  I did read something about the nasal strip.  Well, he'll run, but he can't use his nasal strips, right?  I don't know if they'll run.  Jimmy couldn't run either?  No, I couldn't because I'm very stuffy.  You couldn't run with your nasal strips?  Oh, I forgot you used to wear those things.  Yeah, I still do take them tonight.  You do?  But I bet they run them.  There's no way you get to...  They said they won't run them if he can't wear the nasal strip.  If he can't wear his nasal strip.  What would happen to the horse?  I just think it would be bad for the horse, and he said that the horse is the number one  concern.  Oh, boy.  Well, just squeeze all his sperm out of him and run the damn thing. 
[00:48:00]  That's it.  Get a bunch of jizz.  Get all the jizz out of him and run him because you've got to go for the triple crown.  That's stupid.  He's going to run.  You have a chance of the triple crown.  You don't do it because of the nasal strip rule?  Maybe they'll let him wear the nasal strip because...  They applied for like a, you know, exception or something.  Yeah.  What is the nasal strip rule?  Why can't you...  And why does this horse need the nasal strips?  New York apparently is the only state that doesn't allow them.  Why?  I don't know.  What is it?  Got something to do with Sheldon Silver and the fucking unions like UFC does? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Figures New York's the only one.  Maybe it's an assault strip.  That's another reason.  And like horses' nostrils aren't big enough.  You see those things?  No kidding.  Hey, have you seen these things, people?  Am I right?  Why don't they allow them?  I don't know.  I don't know.  No one knows.  I mean, I know.  I read the article this morning.  We need a horse person on the line to explain that to us.  I hit the triple on the race.  Was that real?  That was real, right?  Yeah.  It didn't pay shit. 
[00:49:00]  I had it twice and it paid $38, so I made $76 on a triple that, you know, usually  the triple pays in the hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars, but the favorite one  and two other horses that weren't so far out of the money also came in, so I don't win  that much.  But it's kind of always fun.  I dusted off the old online horse racing account that I have.  You've got to have an account to gamble everything, you know?  But I tried betting on horses a few times. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  I never.  I don't know.  Yeah, it's a little.  I only bet the big races.  People really like doing it, though.  Yeah.  It's kind of fun to go to the track and...  Yeah, when you go to the track, it's a lot more to it.  It's a fun experience.  Stand on the rail.  That, I guess, is kind of fun.  They'll come thundering past you.  It's pretty cool.  But to just bet on them, I like doing it on the big races.  I just throw numbers.  I don't know.  That's pretty much it.  Five, seven, one.  Let's try that combo this time.  I'm not going to study the program. 
[00:50:00]  I'm sure there were people that did so much studying and bet the triple and missed it.  And then I just went, yeah, that, that, that.  Did you really do it that way?  Yeah.  I didn't give a shit.  You didn't study it all?  Nothing.  That's funny.  I just picked three horses.  Wait, was it the California Chrome one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy fuck, man.  You should have thrown some real money at that.  I know, right?  It's easy to say that now.  Only two bucks?  Well, I actually, I boxed it, so it cost me $12.  But I got 76 back. 
[00:50:30]  California Chrome's triple crown chase could be derailed by New York's ruling outlawing  nasal strips.  Let's see.  His cough didn't slow him, but New York regulations could stop California Chrome's triple crown  bid.  The state rule that does not allow horses to wear nasal strips could force California Chrome  out of the Belmont Stakes and end the Chestnut Colts' chance of winning the sport's first  triple crown since 1978. 
[00:51:00]  California Chrome will need the approval of Belmont's three stewards to wear the nasal strips he  used during the winning rides in the Kentucky and Preakness Stakes.  On Sunday, the connections of the horse made an official appeal to the stewards who were  considering it according to New York State Gaming Commission.  Now, here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  They will absolutely let him wear it because it's a money issue.  Of course.  If there's a chance to get a triple crown winner at Belmont, the people are going to be all 
[00:51:30]  over that place.  There's going to be a huge presence.  Yeah.  Huge press, publicity for Belmont.  So why the fuck would they not allow it?  There's even more attention for the Belmont Stakes right now because there's a chance at  the triple crown.  And then you're the guy that says, nope, we're not going to allow it.  We're not going to allow it.  And now you're getting half the crowd that would have shown up for the Belmont Stakes  because there's not a triple crown.  Maybe not half the crowd.  They'll probably do well on site, but all the...  Nothing like a triple crown chance, though.  People want to be there. 
[00:52:00]  They're like, oh, I saw it.  It'll hurt the ratings of the race.  Absolutely.  It hurts everything.  It's a pure money issue.  They will let...  Look, there's a little nasal strip on the horse right there.  It doesn't look like anything.  Yeah, why don't they just paint like it's white?  It's white.  Paint brown on the outside so they can't see it.  Paint it.  Here's trending on BleacherReport.com.  But what could happen to the horse if he runs without the strips?  That's what we need to know today.  He must not get as much gas so he can't breathe as much.  He's like, yeah, he probably can't get as much oxygen.  So it's a little, what, birth defect this poor horse has? 
[00:52:30]  Maybe.  Because the other horses don't need him at Belmont.  Ream his nose out.  New York is the only racing state in the country that doesn't allow the nasal strips for thoroughbreds,  though it does permit them in harness racing.  The strips open a horse's nasal passages to help it breathe better,  much like the strips that some people wear to bed to help them sleep.  So what?  He must have some kind of flaw then.  Oh, he's like little Jimmy.  Yes, he is.  He's a sweet horse.  He's got tiny little nostrils.  But he likes lady horses with penises. 
[00:53:00]  If all the horses aren't wearing them, then what's the big deal?  This particular horse really needs him?  Maybe he's so used to racing with them.  Why are they the only ones that say no?  Like if everyone else is allowing it in New York,  seeing the way New York does things is so despicable.  Ridiculous.  Because New York is just a pain in the ass.  Yeah.  It really is.  Across the board, it's just a pain in the ass place to live.  Stupid New York.  It really is. 
[00:53:30]  So we'll see what happens.  Yes.  So I think you're right.  I think they've got to allow the strips.  Just for pure money making issue.  Especially if the guy says, look, I'm telling you right now,  if you don't allow this, we're not running this race.  Oh, I'm sure those stewards will get visits.  Right.  Hey, what are you talking about?  It's horse racing.  Jesus Christ.  You want to talk about envelopes.  Yeah, exactly.  Somebody's getting an envelope in the next couple of days.  Oh, shit.  And you're going to see them say, yep, we're allowing the nasal strips.  Oh, we're allowing it.  We're allowing roller skates on horses.  Whatever they want to fucking. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  If he wants to wear rollerblades, we don't care.  We're fine with it.  Right.  And then there was that other story in Sporting News,  that little kid that fucking switched the root that ball with the chick in the stands.  He's just a little kid.  Right.  And he caught a foul ball.  Right.  And then he throws it to the girl.  He's like, hey, baby, you know, throws her a ball.  But so he switched the foul ball for one that he just had in his hand.  I didn't see this.  It's hilarious.  How old is he? 
[00:54:30]  A little player.  He's like fucking eight.  So he's at the game with the ball to begin with?  I would assume like 12.  12, maybe?  I don't know.  He did this so smoothly.  But what are the odds that a guy that already brings a baseball to the game  catches a foul ball?  Oh, he didn't catch it.  He had a toss to him.  He's like, here, look.  See that kid there in the pink glasses?  Earlier in the game, Luis Rivera throws him a baseball.  Now watch what he does.  He catches that baseball and then turns to the group of young ladies behind him 
[00:55:00]  and said, hey, ladies, would you like a ball?  And they go, oh, aren't you so sweet?  He had the other one in his glove.  The other ball.  The problem is he's got the gamer in his glove.  He never took the gamer out of his glove.  Ladies, would you like a baseball?  And look at the girl in the middle.  Oh, that's so sweet.  Oh, that's great.  The game ball.  Good for him.  He's a player.  That is the play of the game. 
[00:55:30]  But I bet you he already got that ball at that game as well.  Because he's sitting right there where they toss a lot of balls into the stands.  Why would he switch it?  Or maybe he just had it in his hand.  Right.  The other one's in the glove.  It's like, I'll just give you this one.  He's like, oh, I already got one.  Maybe.  I already got one today.  Yeah.  I don't know.  But that's still really funny.  Yeah, it was kind of funny.  The girls thought it was adorable.  Adorbs?  Did anyone see the billboards?  Music Awards?  I was going to.  Oh, no.  I didn't know they were on. 
[00:56:00]  Well, yeah.  I had no clue.  Who watches TV when it's actually on these days?  Everyone lip syncing their asses off.  Were they?  A lot of lip syncing?  Oh, God.  Terrible.  Who'd they think they are?  Frankie Valli?  Some kind of big shot?  People are asking me about the Miley Cyrus performance.  She did Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  Yeah.  And it was a cool performance, but she's lip syncing.  So I think nothing of her performance.  Why would she do that?  You're going to know it's the Beatles. 
[00:56:30]  I mean, why would she sing her own?  Nothing.  So I think absolutely nothing of it.  It would have been cool to see her actually sing the song in front of everybody.  Hmm.  Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly.  What is she wearing on her face? 
[00:57:00]  No.  You can't really tell if anyone's lip syncing on internet.  Cheesy video.  Right.  I can't stand Miley Cyrus.  I would love to make out with her, though.  She's a good woman.  There's sexually please.  I think her voice is average.  In that world, her voice is average, so she knows she's got to do all this other shit. 
[00:57:30]  Who's the dude?  I don't know.  Backup singer?  Yeah.  Well, he was front and center for this song.  He was a big part of this song.  I think.  Huh?  I think he's just a singer.  Yeah.  Oh, I know who that guy is.  I started listening to a new band recently.  Yeah?  Did you?  I never heard of them before, but I really enjoyed them.  Pink Floyd?  No. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  No.  But they're a few years old, but I had never heard of them.  The Fratellis?  What?  He's setting this up for something.  No, I'm not.  I promise you I'm not.  I guess some people might not think they're the bad guys in the bad family in the Goonies.  No.  Is that what they're called?  Yeah.  They sing that Chelsea Dagger song with the Blackhawk shoes.  Oh, okay.  But that wasn't.  How does it go?  I mean, it's old.  It's like from 2006 and 7.  Oh. 
[00:58:30]  They had a moment.  Yeah, they're good.  I swear I'd never heard of this band.  You've heard this song?  You've heard this song.  I told I liked him to a Scottish guy yesterday.  He wanted to spit on me.  Yeah?  Yeah, but I do.  So it's Scotland for the.  Jesus.  Well, they're Scottish.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Oh, yeah, of course.  I've heard this before.  Wait, they have more than one song?  Yeah.  I always felt like these guys were like one hit wonder.  Yeah.  He looks good. 
[00:59:00]  Well, you must be a girl with shoes like that.  She said you know me well.  And the Beatles really had an influence on a lot of bands.  Oh, dude, without a doubt.  Jesus.  Didn't they?  Jesus.  Come on.  I think Flathead is called a song.  I am?  Yeah.  But I can't believe it's another band I haven't heard of.  No, this one.  I mean, I heard of this song, but I went and searched out the Fratellis.  No.  I might buy their record. 
[00:59:30]  I might buy their record.  That's great.  45.  I gotta say.  They're 45.  I am.  This was a big song, too.  It was, right?  They had a moment where they were like, a lot of people were talking about him.  That's a wild thing.  A little Jack White influence, too, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or no, he stole it from them.  Oh, okay.  No Fratellis tattoos? 
[01:00:00]  No.  Is this Jack White-like?  Just asking?  Yeah.  A little bit.  I mean, it's the Strokes and White Stripes.  Right.  What was that other band?  They finally broke up.  They were in here.  Jet?  Yeah, Jet.  Yeah, Jet.  A little Jet action.  Yeah, yeah, I hear that.  I kind of like this.  I'm going to go search out a few more songs from them.  Oh.  Whatever happened to the Fratellis?  That was it.  I mean, they faded away?  They played until 2009.  They broke up until 2012.  I looked at Wikipedia.  They have really tall girls in their videos. 
[01:00:30]  Busty.  I want, like, a pin-up girl, like a real tall pin-up girl, just to dominate me with a size  10 feet.  All right.  Yeah, I kind of like them.  Yeah, I'm going to start listening to newer, younger kids' music.  Kids' music.  Start.  Sure.  The Fratellis, they passed me by it. 
[01:01:00]  I don't know much about them at all.  I've never heard of them.  It's a cool little sound.  Yeah.  What was the band on the Billboard Awards last night?  The young kids that are kind of a rock band from, I think, Australia.  And the drummer was wearing a...  Silverchair?  Oh, God.  What is it, Silverchair?  Those young kids.  Abba.  Just, they dress like fake angst.  Like, the late singer had a Misfits t-shirt on.  Did he?  And the guitarist had his hair, like, it looked like he got, like, sprayed with a whole bunch 
[01:01:30]  of sperm.  So it all went...  It's all, like, sideways.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.  It's, like, it's so well thought...  Yeah, I guess...  Oh, this is a boy band.  Yeah.  What's their name?  Five Seconds of Summer.  They're, like, the new boy band.  But during the billboards last night, they were just trying to be over-cool with their...  Like, it's so...  It's so, like, hacked to wear a Misfits t-shirt as a lead singer, I think.  But they're not, like, a rock band.  And then the guy with his sperm hair.  I didn't...  Sperm hair.  I really didn't know much about him until last night. 
[01:02:00]  Sperm hair.  And then the drummer thinking it's cool to wear a Pink Floyd t-shirt?  Well, they're a teeny bopper band.  I get it, Sam.  I understand all that.  But when, like, when your favorite band wore some kind of t-shirt, like the Ramones or something,  you knew they kind of just said, ah, fuck it, I'm just going to wear this shirt today.  It wasn't...  Yeah.  It wasn't thought out like these guys now do.  Show the performance from last night so you can see the guy's sperm hair.  And the Misfits t-shirt. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  I'm amazed at people who do good music videos.  This is not a particularly good one.  No.  But I was watching that...  The song was catchy.  I mean, you know, I understand that much, but...  But to conceptualize a music video, there's really a fucking art to that.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a real talent.  Look, here they are.  Look, they can walk out like they're badasses, Ed.  You'll love this.  Badass.  Look, look.  He's got his Misfits t-shirt in there.  Sperm hair. 
[01:03:00]  Sperm hair.  And then that guy dressed more like a more boy band-ish.  Uh-huh.  And then the drummer has his pink Floyd t-shirt on.  Because they're edgy but safe.  There's nothing edgy about these guys.  No.  Maybe to a 14-year-old girl, they look edgy.  I don't know.  These guys are good.  You like them?  Sure.  Chipper.  You sound like angels.  Chipper, wait a minute.  I'm getting confused.  The headband on the drummer.  These guys are rocking.  They are rocking.  Do you understand what I'm trying to say? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, they're douches.  Okay, good.  And you're not wrong.  Fucking tools.  Just NSYNC pretending to be a rock band.  Is that what's going on here?  It's a boy band, but somebody stuck instruments in front of them, and they're pretending they're  rock singers.  Are they popular?  Yeah.  But it's well thought out.  Like, there's someone behind the scenes going, all right, here, you're going to wear the Misfits  t-shirt today.  And then he probably even said, who are the Misfits?  Who are the Misfits?  I don't know who the Misfits.  Don't worry about it.  It'll be cool.  Unless you want the jizz hair.  Right.  We're going to give him the jizz hair tonight. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to get the cut-off fucking white shirt.  Can I wear the skeleton t-shirt?  Exactly.  Thank you.  You get it.  Hey, that pink Floyd shirt, can anyone claim that for tonight's performance?  I'll take that.  These guys were here a couple weeks ago, and there were masses of little girls on both  sides of the building waiting for them.  Really?  Yes.  They're that big, huh?  They're huge right now.  What are they called?  Five Seconds of Summer.  Are they from Australia?  Yes.  Is this the band that Kendall Jenner fucked up? 
[01:04:30]  Yes.  Because she can't read?  Correct.  She's fucking gorgeous, but she's a dummy like the rest of her sisters.  Dumb as dirt, huh?  Yeah.  Although, how dumb are the sisters if they're all multi-millionaires?  Yeah.  They got the right people behind them, I guess.  Did you see the Kendall Jenner clip?  No, I didn't.  This is a good one.  You guys.  She actually said something like, you guys, I can't, I'm really bad at reading or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Watch this.  Smokin' hot.  Please welcome Kendall Jenner.  Hotter than her sister now. 
[01:05:00]  The band about to rock the Billboard Awards comes from Down Under, but the direction they're  heading is straight up.  Recently, they made their debut on the Billboard 200 number two.  This summer, and now we welcome one.  She didn't say One Direction.  Yeah, she was.  Guys, I'm the worst reader.  They're only getting bigger.  Take a look.  What?  Wow.  She didn't say that either. 
[01:05:30]  No.  Summer.  Because she misunderstood.  She didn't know the name of the band.  No.  And the name of the band is what?  Five Seconds of Summer.  Five Seconds of Summer.  I wonder if the teleprompter stopped or something.  No, because she admitted she can't read.  She would have said the teleprompter.  She posted a tweet about it.  I'm saying that.  She said, that's the last time I leave the house without my contacts.  That's such a lie.  She did fine up until then.  You would leave your house without your glasses, but if you had contacts, you'd put those in 
[01:06:00]  always because no one notices that you wear contacts.  She's an idiot.  She's cute, though.  How old is she?  She is pretty hot.  She's 18, 19 at this point, right?  She's legit now.  I'll take her out for a nice fro-yo.  A fro-yo.  A fro-yo.  Oh, God.  A fro-yo.  What the fuck?  I know how the young people speak.  You want to go for a fro-yo?  Put on a Fratelli's record.  Yeah.  Put on a Fratelli's record, grab some fro-yo.  I can make love to your mouth like a pocket pussy. 
[01:06:30]  Isn't that one of those places where you serve yourself and then when you put your thing  up on the counter, it's like $18?  Right.  You're like, what?  What the fuck?  I just want a little fro-yo.  A fro-yo.  It's costing me $18.  I went out with dumb Bob Kelly last night after dinner at his house and we were just grabbing  a little fro-yo.  What'd you have for dinner, though?  Because Bob's eating right these days.  They grilled a little sausage on the grill.  Sausage.  And some onions and pepper.  What kind of sausage?  I don't know.  It was good, though.  James Dean?  Sausage?  Sausage.  Jimmy Dean's sausage. 
[01:07:00]  Jimmy Dean's sausage.  Sausage.  Were they big enough?  Oh, yeah.  The sausage?  And a little bit of chicken.  And a nice salad.  Ooh, nice.  And they didn't have any decaps, so we went to Starbucks.  Look at the sound of that.  And I saw some frozen yogurt.  And as everyone knows, I'm a big frozen yogurt fan.  But I put, Bob got like a little bit of some strawberries for his wife.  And he put it on the thing and I put my fist on it and it came to $77.  What?  Well, because I put my arm on it and weighed it.  Oh, I got you.  I had to redo it. 
[01:07:30]  I was so happy.  It was some fro-yo?  Yeah.  What's fro-yo?  Oh, frozen yogurt.  Just a fancy name for frozen yogurt, I guess.  I'm a big abbreviator.  It's an abreeve for frozen yogurt.  An abreeve.  That's right.  Of course it is.  It's an abreeve, y'all.  An abreeve.  We abreeve fro-yo.  Yeah.  Fro-yo.  We love our abreeves.  Yeah.  Yeah, when we're in the stewed.  Yeah.  Don't be such a douchebag.  Can we see the hologram before we go to break?  Fuck yeah. 
[01:08:00]  You see the hologram?  I didn't see the hologram, neither.  This hologram technology is pretty fucking trippy.  Especially as the photos get better and the video gets better that they're actually using  to the original captures.  And this is going to be a shitty quality, shitty video of it.  It's not really, they don't have a really good video of it.  No?  No, I was searching it out last night to see it again.  What the fuck?  Uh, check this out from last night.  All right.  Michael Jackson performed.  Wait a minute.  Oh, did he?  Did you see all the dummies on Twitter that said how, uh, what was the hashtag? 
[01:08:30]  It was all these people that were like, how is this possible?  Or how, how is Michael, oh, what was the hashtag?  Fuck.  How is Michael Jackson performing?  Or something like that.  Because they're dumb.  They didn't understand.  They were very confused.  And a bunch of these people on Twitter thought that maybe he was still alive is, is the point  I'm making here.  The big reveal was that he was fake his own death.  They were very confused.  People are allowed to vote.  What was the hashtag?  Because some of these tweets would be really funny to read. 
[01:09:00]  Because they were like, what the fuck?  Dolt?  Yeah.  It might have been, how is Michael Jackson?  I don't know.  Uh, 10.  Let's see.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  If you find it after the break, maybe someone can search it out and search out some of the  tweets that were under the hashtag.  Because they meant it, too.  They weren't even trying to be fucking Twitter assholes. 
[01:09:30]  See what it looks like.  Yeah.  I'll play it for these guys.  Wow.  That's a pretty good copy.  ABC got their shit together.  Put some videos up, finally.  Bunch of soldiers running out.  Hi.  Well, you've got to pump it up, because in the end, he's not there.  Fancy soldiers.  Yeah.  At the end, you're watching a movie.  Right.  Is this Rhythm Nation?  I got it. 
[01:10:00]  It's a good credit to have a dance for the movie of Michael Jackson.  Yeah.  Michael Jackson's there.  How?  How?  How?  How?  Why is it all wiggly? 
[01:10:30]  Now it comes off the screen, kind of a thing.  The kids must get to the school.  How are they doing? 
[01:11:00]  That's pretty cool.  On the stage.  He dances for the man that works, who works up all the time.  She can't be rude.  That's where it really comes into play, when the guy walks behind him.  I'd be a dick and just stand right in the middle of him.  Room the illusion.  Finger tiny and he doesn't move.  I think all of those guys are holograms or something.  Yeah, I think so.  You're right.  That might make them all look good, right?  Yeah. 
[01:11:30]  You'd think they'd advertise more that Michael Jackson was going to be on.  Well, this is a big reveal that he faked his own death, so.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It was a surprise.  What the fuck?  And on TV, you can't tell, obviously.  I wonder how great it was live.  I wonder what it looked like live.  People are crying in the audience.  Ew.  Ew.  He's doing a little dance in there. 
[01:12:00]  You should bring back Little Michael.  Right?  That's the one.  Bring back Little Michael. 
[01:12:30]  The only problem is they have to do the hologram, you know, back.  Yeah.  Further back on the stage.  You notice that?  Yeah, he's way back.  And they figure out how to move it even closer to the audience.  Yeah.  He would probably like this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like that the resurrected Michael Jackson is the one from, like, 91.  Yeah.  Instead of what he looked like. 
[01:13:00]  That's true.  Yeah, they did.  Yeah, they did.  The whopper thin nose.  Yeah, why not?  You know?  Just resurrect the good one.  It's like dangerous Michael Jackson.  Right.  This is a new song, right?  Yeah, he's got a whole new album coming out.  There's a hologram Michael going to tour.  I bet.  Yeah.  I bet you, too.  That family loves money.  Jermaine's going to try to get on it, too. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, boy.  It must be a hologram Jermaine.  That's pretty cool, man.  That is like...  They're figuring out that technology.  Holy shit.  Yeah, not bad.  Not too shabby.  The hologram got a standing ovation.  Yeah.  Yeah, it did.  Isn't that great?  Hmm.  Well, the hologram was singing just as legit as just about every artist was.  Exactly.  Why not?  Exactly.  What's the difference in the end?  Living people should just do that. 
[01:14:00]  They don't even have to show up.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  Just like, yeah, fuck it.  You're Miley Cyrus.  Yeah, I'm in fucking 20 cities tonight.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, fuck it.  Well, eventually.  Yeah.  Think about it.  I know.  Concerts open everywhere together.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why move the hologram from one place to another?  Just have a whole bunch of them.  Get it all done in one weekend.  That's it.  Ten bucks a ticket, but 20 shows at a time.  So it's like...  How about hologram O&A?  Nice.  Nice.  We sit here as holograms while we're actually, you know...  I like that. 
[01:14:30]  Home.  I like that idea.  Poolside.  Nice.  Imagine computers that can interpret what somebody would say, like, you know, say 15 years  Chanel, and they'll be able to react according to the moment and the audience in the moment  here, they have a billion possible responses.  Fuck you, asshole.  Yeah.  Five things show up on a screen.  Thank you, sir.  Go home.  Fuck you, asshole.  And give me a hat.  Yes.  It would take about six months before the holograms had full artificial intelligence who were much 
[01:15:00]  better than the original performer.  Yeah.  The other highlight from the billboards was just how ugly Lorde is.  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  It's poor Lorde.  They threw her out there again?  Oh.  Now she's...  She's having more hits, dude.  She's not going anywhere.  Is she popular?  Yeah.  Yeah, but she is ugly, man.  Actually, I mean, I'm not arguing that.  Wow.  They really cleaned her up for that one video, because she looks really sexy in that one  video, but... 
[01:15:30]  She looks like the Wicked Witch of the West now, was one of the big hashtags last night.  Oh, no.  That's a shame.  And she convulses on stage.  I hate that convulsion thing.  She's only 17 years old.  Is she?  Okay.  Okay.  Is that her thing, to be really strange on stage?  Yeah.  She's been doing that with all the songs.  They're good songs.  She does love God. 
[01:16:00]  Mm-hmm.  She's dressed like the preacher in Poltergeist 2.  Oh, very good.  That's even better.  Yeah.  The boy in the remake of Witness.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's terrible looking.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I don't love this song.  Poor girl.  But then again, we all looked awkward at 17 years old.  Yeah.  I look like Jeffrey Dahmer with greasy hair.  Ooh.  Tinted glasses.  Nice.  Oh, I was Creep City. 
[01:16:30]  And then the pictures I've seen of her, like, on the beach, it's not even like, well, you  know, she's got a nice body.  That body is the weirdest thing, too.  Really strange.  It'd be funny when she's, like, 23, 24, and she realizes she doesn't have to make stupid  faces on stage.  Yeah, just sing.  Why didn't I just sing?  Yeah, look.  She's like, right, right, right.  Yeah, whatever.  I'd sang that song 200 times already.  Why was I making that face?  Yeah, it's not this emotional, like, thing anymore. 
[01:17:00]  It's just...  It looks like she's being tased.  Is she lip syncing or no?  It didn't look like it on TV, but who knows?  I think they all have to lip sync, I bet you now.  I bet you that's just what you do.  They don't like the curses.  I don't know for sure, but...  I don't know, either.  Yeah, but it looks like they want all these performances to be so perfect that they all  have to lip sync.  But the Fratellis don't lip sync.  They don't do anything.  They haven't performed in years.  That's not true.  They've been on a lot of award shows recently.  Fratellis.  I love that Jim comes out with his new band.  It's the Fratellis. 
[01:17:30]  They don't do anything.  They certainly do.  They don't lip sync.  They don't sing.  They don't remember.  Bigger than One Direction.  You're out of your mind.  Paul in Maryland.  Hey there, Paul.  Hey, Paul.  Yeah.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  I'm Charlie, man.  I think it's okay that Florida isn't all that attractive.  Because you think about the 80s and 90s when everybody was about a look and no talent  whatsoever.  She does have a look.  She has a look.  Yeah, but it's just fun to beat up on her how ugly she is, though.  It's fun.  I mean, it's just fun. 
[01:18:00]  Like, I don't care.  Yeah.  I guess it's a little statement about how talented she is.  I think what happened here was the fact that we all got tricked, because that Royals video,  she's beautiful in that damn thing with her eyes and everything, and then it turns out  she doesn't look like that at all.  No.  That's why I think she gets such a beating, by the way.  Networks try so hard to get things trending on Twitter.  Wicked Witch of the West was a trend on Twitter while this was on. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, that's just me.  By who?  It was a trend.  People on Twitter.  It was trending.  Oh, but you said the networks want the trends.  That's what I'm saying, that, like, without even trying...  Like, people try for...  Oh, I see what you're saying.  There's so many people talking about comparing her to the Wicked Witch of the West.  Because the hashtags these programs, you know, choose, are so lame.  Right.  They are lame.  And then it's one black guy, usually, that comes up with the Wicked Witch of the West.  Bitch look like Wicked Witch of the West. 
[01:19:00]  And that's all it takes.  The network should be hiring those guys.  Right.  That's a good one.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Bitch looks like Wicked Witch of the West.  In mid-melt.  She do look like Wicked Witch of the West, though.  Oh, shit.  And all of a sudden, that's trending, and ABC wants ABC Billboards 2014 hashtag or something.  Yeah, and they always put their own, the NBC or the ABC logo with it, or like, Wicked  Witch of the West, ABC, and they make too long, and no one can tweet anything.  No one wants your dumb network name and their fucking hashtag. 
[01:19:30]  Because there's no hipness to it.  No.  It would be funny if they got so hungry for hashtags that they were, like, insulting every artist  with, like, slams about every artist with a hashtag because people would actually  use them.  Yeah, like, if NBC was writing tweets, like, look at the hat on this cunt, and that would  be a tweet.  NBC hashtag.  Hashtag.  Hat cunt.  Yeah.  Hat cunt.  Hashtag must-see Thursdays, whatever it's called.  Must-see Thursdays.  That's...  Whatever.  That's funny.  Comedy Tuesdays, hat cunt. 
[01:20:00]  Right.  So that's it, I guess.  The billboards.  It was a lame show.  Was it?  My only tuned in late.  Yeah, I had to turn it off.  Saw a few things, and then I moved on.  All right.  Why don't we take a break here?  We'll get into some other things.  We got some apologies if we're still doing that bit.  All right.  I think we should continue that bit.  Sure.  It's easy.  Apparently a rumor came out that Sam is going to be working at WWE.  Oh, yeah.  What happened there?  Whoops. 
[01:20:30]  Your boy Vince lost $350 million in one day.  No longer a billionaire.  You mean millionaire Vince McMahon?  Yes.  That knocks him out of the billionaire category, you think?  No, he's not a billionaire.  On Friday, he became not a billionaire anymore.  Oh, wow.  What kind of shitty mood was he in Friday night?  Oh, my God.  God damn it.  We'll explain that whole thing next.  It's worth talking about.  Absolutely.  Just on paper.  And some other things.

[01:29:30]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  I'm not going to be shy.  You don't have to go back.  I don't need glory.  I'm going to see you.  I'm so behind with movies. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  I want to go see Godzilla in a movie theater.  How do you do that?  Yeah.  How does one do that?  How do you go to the movies?  I forgot how to go to the movies.  Me too.  Why don't we get screener copies for Godzilla?  Oh, boy.  Because it made $100 million.  They don't need us?  No, they don't need you.  Fuck!  That's some crazy money. 
[01:30:30]  Was it good, though?  Did you see it, Sam?  I haven't seen it yet, but my buddy, who is a big Godzilla fan.  Aren't we all, though?  Come on.  No, but he's like Godzilla toys, Godzilla toys.  Oh, really?  He's like a Godzilla nerd.  Oh, okay.  Like you are a wrestling nerd?  Yes.  He's a Godzilla nerd?  Okay.  Godzilla nerd.  And he had his heart broken over the Ferris Bueller version of Godzilla.  We all did.  We all, yes.  That was stupid.  He said it was really, really good.  Really?  Yes.  All right.  I see what's going on here.  Yeah, I heard it. 
[01:31:00]  It's pretty goddamn good right there.  Okay, then.  I'm definitely seeing it.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, Mr. Push-Ups.  Looks like my four-year-old son's going to have to enjoy Godzilla.  That's the only way I'm going to see it.  Aren't you talking?  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Didn't you say one of the, like, Halloween cartoons was too scary for him?  Yeah.  He'll be okay with Godzilla, though, right?  He's going to have to be.  That's the only way I'm going to be able to see the damn thing.  Is he a Bryan Cranston fan?  He doesn't know who Bryan Cranston is. 
[01:31:30]  He doesn't?  No.  That's my idea.  No fucking clue.  He's in that Godzilla movie.  I want to see that, man.  Yeah, it looks pretty good, huh?  Fuck yeah.  3D.  IMAX.  Fuck yeah.  How do we go?  Well, you go to a movie theater and you purchase a ticket by that Lincoln Center.  But how many days in advance?  I mean, if you go during the week, you could just get a ticket right now online.  Fuck it.  I'm hoping.  Well, we're off this week, so it's like, when do you leave for Mexico?  Wednesday.  All right, so Tuesday.  Oh. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Are you guys doing anything on the little break?  Mexico.  I wanted to go to Dubai, but I just got too much stuff I got to do, so I'll probably  just make love to myself.  That'd be nice, right?  Neighbors.  Second place at the movie theater.  I like Neighbors, man.  It's funny as shit.  You saw it?  I saw it.  I went to the theater and saw it.  It was funny, right?  It was really funny.  It started out a little like whatever, and I'm like, uh-oh, and then it picks up, and  it's like, I thought the gags were hilarious.  They were really funny gags. 
[01:32:30]  And you were right, there wasn't any, there wasn't even, there was no moral compass to  the film whatsoever.  Like, it wasn't like one of them was good and one of them was bad.  It wasn't like you learned something at the end of the day.  It was like, here's some funny shit.  I like that.  Did they leave the tits in the movie?  Because some people said that we might have saw like a different version of the movie.  I think there was titties in that movie.  Okay.  We saw kind of more of a hard R when we went to the preview.  What's it rated?  R.  R, okay.  Good comedy should be rated R.  It seemed like a pretty hard R. 
[01:33:00]  The airbags?  Yeah, that was funny.  Oh my god.  Seth Rogen is like the king of CGI comedy gags.  Right.  Like, he's like the guy who started doing, using CGI to do slapstick.  Oh really?  You know what I mean?  Like, I've never seen that otherwise.  And then, it was filmed really nice.  It looked good.  I felt like it was in the middle of a rave.  Oh yeah.  For a while.  Well, I'm telling you, the filming of it was great too.  And the Batman joke was really funny. 
[01:33:30]  Which one was the Batman joke?  Zac Efron and Seth Rogen were going back and forth about, what does Batman sound like?  And Seth Rogen was doing the Michael Keaton impression, and Zac Efron was going, get over  here!  Oh, okay.  I'm Batman!  What about the Robert De Niro themed party?  Yeah.  The college kids were doing a De Niro themed party, and so Zac Efron was dressed up as  De Niro in Taxi Driver.  Yeah.  But they had him from the fuckers, or Meet the Parents, whatever. 
[01:34:00]  Dave Franco was like...  Everyone was around a keg outside the window in their Robert De Niro character.  I thought it was funny.  James Franco?  Dave Franco.  Oh, Dave Franco's brother.  Who was in Superbad, because I saw Superbad over the weekend.  I forgot how fucking great that movie was.  Watched the whole damn thing, and there's Dave Franco running across the field in the  soccer scene.  He was in 21 Jump Street.  Yeah.  Which was also very funny.  He's going to do all right in Hollywood, this Dave Franco, I think.  But in the stupid Robert De Niro party, some of them were dressed as Al Pacino characters, 
[01:34:30]  like, oh, you're just a bunch of stupid college kids.  I had no idea.  They really got the whole stupid college kid thing down.  Oh, yeah.  And Seth Rogen was like, Seth Rogen was like, that guy's not even De Niro.  Right.  It's Samuel L. Jackson from...  And, uh, you talking to me?  Are you talking to me?  They're all just sitting there, you talking to me?  Bad impressions of movies they hadn't seen.  Right.  Except for Meet the Fuckers.  You can tell they barely know who De Niro is. 
[01:35:00]  They just thought it would be cool to do or something.  Just an excuse to drink and take pills.  Right.  I liked it.  I definitely liked it.  I like good impressions.  You do?  I do.  And I saw a clip online that was with Steve Coogan.  I don't know if I talked about this yet.  Who we had on.  Yeah, of course.  Who's very funny.  And there's some movie he did where he does a Michael Caine impression with another guy.  A Michael Caine impression?  Have you ever heard of Michael Caine impression?  No.  I didn't think it was possible to do a Michael Caine impression. 
[01:35:30]  Wow.  But there's two of them.  The worksheet journalists have described my impressions as stunningly accurate.  This is him and some other guy.  I've not heard your Michael Caine, but I assume it would be something along the lines of,  My name's Michael Caine.  That is where you are so wrong.  And you can look at my live video for proof.  Because that's the very thing I don't do.  I say that he used to talk like that.  Do you Michael Caine?  Okay.  I say, Michael Caine used to talk like this in the 1960s, right?  But that has changed.  And I say that over the years, Michael's voice has calmed down several. 
[01:36:00]  And all of the cigars and the brandy does, let me finish, can now be heard.  Okay.  I've not fucking finished in the back of the voice and the voice now.  I've still not finished the voice.  Are you panicking?  Because you look like you're about to bloody talk.  Let me finish.  Right.  So, Michael Caine's voice now in the Batman movies and in Harry Brown.  I can't go fast because Michael Caine talks very, very slowly. 
[01:36:30]  This is how Michael Caine speaks.  Michael Caine speaks to his nose like that.  He gets very, very specific.  It's very like that.  When it gets loudly, it gets very loud indeed.  It gets very specific.  It's not quite nasal enough the way you're doing it.  All right?  You're not doing it the way he speaks.  You're not doing it with the kind of, and you don't do the broken voice.  But it gets very emotional.  But it gets very emotional indeed. 
[01:37:00]  She was only 16 years old.  She was only 16.  You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off.  That's Michael Caine.  Wow.  That's awesome.  That's pretty funny.  Awesome.  Really funny.  Uh, let's say, uh, hi to Matt in, uh, North Dakota.  My God, Matt.  What's going on, buddy?  No, that is.  First time in a long time.  Oh, God.  What a disaster.  This is starting out as... 
[01:37:30]  Ear cancer.  You're on the phone.  Mostly, I just wanted to call and tell you guys how much I love you.  I've been listening since, uh, in 2005, and, uh...  We got two shows left.  Two shows before vacation.  One and a half, almost.  One and a half.  That's right.  1.5.  We don't have to put up with that shite.  1.5.  Now you do the voice.  Yes, I do.  I can't stop. 
[01:38:00]  It's 1.5 shows.  Can you do that all morning, please?  I certainly will.  Thank you.  1.5.  Michael Caine.  What's the choice?  Michael Caine.  Yeah.  I liked him in, um...  In the Prestige.  Michael Caine.  Which is, that's the only impression I do of him, is when he goes,  It's a bloody double!  Who is that?  It's Michael Caine.  Oh.  It's...  It's a bloody double!  No.  That's all he says.  I like when he's doing the... 
[01:38:30]  When Coogan's doing it in the last moment of that.  Yeah.  And he stops.  She was only...  You're only supposed to...  And he just...  Right.  I'll take him, goes...  What about The Amazing Spider-Man?  Does that have a buzz?  What happened?  It's a...  Is it Twilight movie?  Yeah, it's a...  Second week out?  It's exactly...  No, this is like a fourth week.  Third week.  Oh, it's been out that long already.  Jesus.  I mean, the new Spider-Man franchise is a total, like...  It's a terrible franchise.  Yeah, teeny bopper Twilight.  Exactly. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  It's not...  The Tobey Maguire ones, they kicked ass.  The Tobey Maguire ones were fucking fine.  Except the third one was terrible.  All right, the third one did suck.  That first one, though, when they first rebooted...  Right.  ...fucking amazing.  Well, obviously.  Spider-Man, amazing.  Sure, it was really good.  Oh, and Jim Norton was in it.  I still get, like, $1.50 checks from that.  Do you really?  Nice.  Yeah, far and just, you know, released on the moon.  Yes.  Do you want to get, like, a little DVD check or some weird technology check?  I actually should say that.  I got a whole stack of those type of checks.  I got to go to the bank.  Yeah, I got some of those.  You don't cash them? 
[01:39:30]  I always cash them.  Well, there's $1.28.  There's $6.17.  Yeah.  There's $4.29.  Yeah.  What is it?  From the Louie thing?  Oh, that TBS thing I did.  Yeah, that's being played.  Yeah, that.  I got the Louie ones.  I got the Amy ones.  Yeah, he didn't pay absolutely nothing.  Yeah, it's like, you know, a couple of bucks.  Yeah, it's just fun, I guess.  I still get them from Lucky Louie.  Do you really?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, every time they distribute to a new media, excuse me, or a new market, you get a little 
[01:40:00]  something.  And I've gotten checks for, I don't know if it's from Lucky Louie or whatever, for $0.06,  $0.10.  Just computer generated.  Do you cash them?  Yeah, but you do.  You like to get a bunch.  You put them all in there.  That's OCD that you cash those.  Yeah.  You know, I was going to throw them out, but then I'm like, I'm already going there, so  you just put them in and throw them in.  I got ones from the Super Terrific Happy Hour.  We've got to just keep signing them.  And those are only for a few cents.  But if there's, you know, a shitload of them, it adds up. 
[01:40:30]  So you'd probably sign them and just take them to the bank.  I bought a, uh, Seinfeld.  I bought a, uh, off eBay, I bought a Richard Pryor, a check to Richard Pryor from the Mod  Squad for like $1.50, whatever it was.  It was some weird residual check he had gotten sent from the Mod Squad.  Oh, right, right.  Never cashed.  Oh, you have that?  I do.  I have it.  Reframe it?  I did, but I got to reframe it and put it somewhere.  It was a really cool check by Aaron Spelling's company.  I told you mine.  I got a Pete Maravich check.  I've talked about this over the years. 
[01:41:00]  Pete Maravich, when I was especially younger, was one of my heroes.  You want to talk about heroes.  Pete Maravich was everything to me.  I was hugely into basketball and played a lot and whatever.  And, uh, fast forward, I got, as a gift, a Pete Maravich cancel check for some plumbing  work.  So you know somehow Pete Maravich clogged his toilet with a good shit and had to call a  plumber and I got the canceled check.  It's big ham shits.  Oh, God. 
[01:41:30]  I got probably one of those floppy socks, Scott.  Yeah.  You got to know Pete Maravich.  Don't understand the floppy sock reference.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  But yeah, I got one of those too.  Yeah.  And there's something kind of cool about it.  I don't know.  That's so weird.  It's like, it made out to some plumbing.  I got, I forgot the plumbing company.  I should, uh, I haven't thought about this.  I just think it's odd that it ends up there.  I know.  It ends up with you.  Yeah.  It's kind of creepy, I guess, right?  Like you write checks all the time and it's like, it ends up with a fan somewhere, you  know?  It's some odd. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Uh, let's say hi to Matt in North Dakota.  Matt.  Oh.  I'm sorry, boys.  I'm sorry.  I got overly exuberant.  You did.  That's right.  What's going on, man?  I just want to redeem myself.  Hey, guys.  Now, watching that, uh, Billboard Awards last night, the Michael Jackson hologram thing,  and nobody's, nobody said anything about it this morning, but I mean, that was not, you  know, that was like an impersonator that they filmed and turned into a image or whatever, 
[01:42:30]  but it certainly wasn't, you know, Michael Jackson.  Oh.  At all.  That's not how the technology works.  How could they get Michael Jackson to perform that song?  He said it was some other guy.  Well, it was a show in Las Vegas called, uh, Michael Jackson 1, and at the end of the  show, they actually take footage from the history tour of Michael Jackson, and they've  sort of turned it into this hologram, right?  But the thing last night, that would have been the same as just putting, like, a Michael  Jackson impersonator on the stage, and everybody would have booed him off the stage, but that 
[01:43:00]  was not Michael Jackson last night at all.  Oh, you're saying that they filmed an impersonator and made the hologram out of that?  Absolutely.  No, there's no way.  It looked...  Oh, yes, there is.  You guys pull it up.  There are a lot of people saying the same thing.  Oh.  Pull up Michael Jackson, look at him.  But don't you think it was just a computer-generated thing?  Like, it was an animated version of Michael Jackson, so of course it's not going to actually  look exactly like Michael Jackson, because it's a computer-animated guy.  Well, maybe that's how they get, maybe that's how they get the... 
[01:43:30]  But the impersonators look that much like Michael Jackson now?  Yeah, he looked a lot like Michael Jackson, but he clearly was not Michael Jackson.  It was, like, a really good...  You had a motion cap, but...  You had a motion cap.  I didn't notice that, but we could see it again, maybe.  Maybe he's right.  I mean, I was looking at his face, and it looked like fucking Michael Jackson.  To us, but...  It's animated, though.  So they're going to look...  It's not like it's a video of Michael Jackson that they just cast on the stage.  Yeah.  They don't have that.  They didn't know...  Yeah, they did that...  Well, no, they did that in the one show, though. 
[01:44:00]  So they're going to have an impersonated motion cap with the little, you know, ping-pong balls  on him, and then they...  That's what the Michael Jackson thing follows, the computer-generated Michael Jackson.  Wait, is that a new song?  Yeah.  He's never performed that song.  Oh, I thought it was an old video that they just made.  No, so it's a computer-animated version of Michael Jackson.  Well, is that one he just never released?  Yeah, he recorded a whole bunch of songs.  The whole album has never been...  Oh, I thought you were joking before.  No, it's a new album.  No, it's...  Yeah.  I mean, that's what...  I mean, when...  Those type albums usually sound like shit. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, it's stuff that you always didn't care about.  We'll see what happens, though.  What was that Beatles song they released years later?  Free as a Bird?  Black...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Free as a Bird!  That's cool.  That was Yoko.  Yoko put her...  Permission slip on that.  Wow.  Let's say hi to Art, who's on with Matt.  Art in Pennsylvania.  Go ahead.  Hey, I just wanted to say that guy's full of shit, because that Michael Jackson thing  was lip-synced.  Well, no shit. 
[01:45:00]  He's an impersonator, so he was obviously lip-syncing.  Yeah.  So you think the whole thing was an impersonator?  Absolutely.  There's two guys...  You guys should give a little of these two guys.  There's a guy named Navi, N-A-V-I, and there's another...  Asshole named E. Casanova, and they are both, like, these, you know, world-renowned Michael  Jackson impersonator guys.  They look incredibly like Michael Jackson, but they're clearly, you know, not Michael Jackson,  and I think they filmed one of those guys.  You know what I mean?  And they filmed one of those guys. 
[01:45:30]  No, I don't know.  In the last year.  That looks kind of...  Why would people take pictures with an impersonator?  Yeah.  Why would you?  Even I wouldn't do that, and I'm a picture worm.  Who's that?  Yeah, he looks...  Yeah, if a Michael Jackson impersonator came here, they don't look like Michael Jackson.  They look like disturbing fucking accident victim Michael Jackson.  Right.  Yeah, but if you film him and you blur him up a little bit, put some of that weird lighting  around him, I mean, you know. 
[01:46:00]  People say that wasn't Michael Jackson.  Who the fuck would notice?  I mean, I just wouldn't...  I would just assume they did all that shit with computers.  There's a hologram.  It was not Michael Jackson on stage.  No, but I mean, it could have been a video that they had prior captured.  Right.  But that's not...  I mean, the Tupac hologram wasn't...  That's not...  It's an animated thing.  It's like a video game.  Right.  It's a passenger from Flight 93.  Really, is it?  That's a pretty good-looking Michael Jackson, this guy.  Whoever that guy is, he looks like a player. 
[01:46:30]  They do look like a player.  A little heavier.  All right.  So, my only point is they made a big to-do that this Michael Jackson hologram was...  A big to-do.  A big to-do?  Did they make a to-do?  Exactly.  I tried to make a to-do.  You're pitching a fit, though.  No, I tried to make a to-do, but it came out as a kerfuffle, or whatever the fuck that's  called.  Kerfuffle.  What's that word?  Man, this guy looks...  A full-on-the-loop.  This guy looks, you know, almost like Michael Jackson.  So, why wouldn't you go, okay, what do I need on my face to bring him home?  Right.  A really... 
[01:47:00]  A child.  Because they're almost...  Yeah.  Desitin and cum in the future.  Because it's close.  It's true.  It's close.  It's really close.  All right, Matt.  Thanks for the info, I guess.  Okay, bye.  All right, buddy.  Check out that.  All right.  I'm right.  Not for you.  Walter.  Walter in Deer Park.  Walter.  Hey, good morning, guys.  I'm on the fucking railroad standing up.  I'm kind of talking low.  Can you hear me? 
[01:47:30]  Yes, Walt.  You're on the Long Island Railroad.  It's all fucking backed up.  Some asshole drove on the tracks in Deer Park this morning.  It's all fucked up.  But listen, getting back to California Chrome, he was walking around pre-race with a big  heart on on Saturday.  He was.  I got a picture.  I got a picture.  Oh, I saw that.  When they get like that, right?  A big horse cat.  Were you the one that tweeted it over the weekend?  I saw it.  Yeah, I sent it out.  And I think it was because of Philly was in the race.  Maybe he got a whiff of that.  Maybe he got a whiff of that. 
[01:48:00]  Look, he's walking around with just a fucking full hard-on before the race.  And NBC.  NBC was.  I was watching a replay on NBC.  They were looking right at it because he was super swaying in the wind.  They didn't mention it at all.  They should have fucking had some South American girl come up there and just start  hobbing it on TV.  German girl.  German girl.  Your phone call.  Your phone call is really creepy because you've got a whisper.  You're whispering about a horse hard-on.  Yeah, a big horse cock.  Big horse cock.  Did you see it on NBC? 
[01:48:30]  Listen, there's no way he's not running into Belmont either.  What do they do at the hard-on if he's got a hard-on and he's about to race?  Well, I think they've got to throw like a bucket of cold water on it or something.  Probably kick it.  How great is this with the whisper?  I think what you do is you duct tape it down to his belly.  Yeah.  Down his leg.  I've seen him in a paddock before.  What they do is if horses continue to do that, they gelled him.  Oh, well, you can't do that. 
[01:49:00]  They won't do that with him, of course, because he's worth $50 million if he wins that race.  If he wins the Belmont.  He really worth that much money?  Oh, wow.  I think once the jockey gets on and gets on the track, that boner goes away.  Or maybe they have someone that just jerks off the horse before the race.  Well, you don't want to do that.  Probably, you know.  Gets rid of some of that energy?  Oh, yeah.  That's what his point...  That's the plan for him.  If he wins the Belmont, he's going to be covering two mares a day, five days a week.  Oh, shit.  For at least $100,000.  I don't think they...  Do they even really let him fuck anymore? 
[01:49:30]  Or are they just artificially inseminate this fucking...  They have to do it.  They have to do it because of the rules and regulations.  Oh, is it?  They have to cover the mares, yeah.  They have to cover the mares?  What's that mean?  Fuck them.  Legit.  They have to...  They bring in a...  They bring in like the pornos, right?  They bring in a...  First, they bring in a...  A fluff mare in there to get them all worked up, you know?  And he gets the scent of that, and then they bring the real mare in, and he covers the  one that he's supposed...  You know? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  How do they capture the cum if it goes in the mare?  The whispering is the best.  Yeah.  So he takes his big horse cum, right?  And he puts her right in her pussy.  He's got to cover the mare, you know?  Get that shit in there.  They bring the fluff mare in first.  Fuck yes.  With a good ass.  You get the horse with the good ass to come in first and walk around.  Oh, my God.  You guys are killing me.  You're a ghoul.  Then he takes his fucking turgid...  I'm fucking whispering on the railroad.  Dude, it's the funny...  I don't know what it is, but it's great. 
[01:50:30]  But wait...  So I thought they mounted a thing that he put...  They put the guy...  The horse's dick through.  Can he fuck the real mare?  Because if he comes in, which good is the load?  Well, I think they got it all worked out, you know?  Yeah.  Well, if he fucks the mare...  Are you in short for a bad load?  Let's say his load goes all over her back instead of inside.  Then what happens?  It's per live foal.  I mean, if the foal's not born alive...  Right.  Then you don't have to pay.  Oh, I see.  Yeah. 
[01:51:00]  Hey, you've got to drain his balls.  His big horse balls.  Hey, you guys should come out for the race, man.  It's going to be a fun time.  I got tickets in the clubhouse.  I bought them back in March.  It's going to be a big day.  $8 million in purses that day.  $8 million.  It's going to be great.  I take a lot of horse calm.  Yeah.  Hey, listen.  Also, I want to tip out a horse.  I got one running this Friday.  Go West Murray.  Yeah?  She's in the sixth race at Belmont.  I'm partners.  I own a 1%.  I think I own a part of the ass. 
[01:51:30]  Is she a mudder?  She's going to run on the turf.  Oh.  She's going to sprint on the turf.  A turf.  How long is the race?  Six furlongs.  Six furlongs?  What is a furlong?  You people in horse talk talk like people?  Five hands up to the braille.  What?  She's a five-hander, a mudder.  There's eight furlongs in a mile.  What the fuck's a furlong?  Yeah, yeah, she's going to be a nice prize. 
[01:52:00]  It's the second time on the turf.  Second time on the turf.  Oh, I'll remember that one.  All right.  Go West Murray.  She's the number one horse.  Go West Murray.  Come on on Friday.  By name for horse.  For the place of bet.  Go West Murray.  Nice.  I hate their fuck.  Buy a hat fanny is in second place.  Buy a hat fanny?  Yeah, marmalade clit coming up from here.  Legs McGillicuddy.  Like a ride.  You don't like horsey names, Levin? 
[01:52:30]  And Bobby Sucker.  I mean, there's always kind of one with a little bit of a wordplay to it.  I can't stand fucking horse names.  How about just Fred?  How about Arnold?  When we get the horse names from yesterday's race or Saturday's race,  can we see if Jimmy's right there, Sam?  What were some of the horses in Preakness?  I guess Larry was taken in 1907.  Yeah, that's probably why, you know.  You've got to come up with new names.  Go West Murray. 
[01:53:00]  I'm going to bet that horse now.  Horse announcers, by the way, are like auctioneers.  They're amazing public speakers.  To be able to rattle that off.  They're changing positions so many times.  Really a hard one to do.  Here's some of the weird horse names that have won the Preakness.  That's pretty good.  By the way, did you make it to Jamaica yet?  Jamaica Station?  I'm coming up to Woodside now.  All right.  All right.  You get it.  Woodside.  Woodside.  Next stop, Woodside.  Anyone whispering about horse talk, please get off the train. 
[01:53:30]  You could play a brewer's bit from, you're changing out, Jamaica.  This guy knows the deal.  I mean, the old gag is, you know, when you were taking the train back out to Long Island,  you just kind of felt safe.  Penn Station a little shady, especially when we were growing up.  But then you got on the train, the doors closed, and you felt like you were in this capsule  of safeness.  Right.  Until they opened the doors at Jamaica Station.  Oh, my God.  And you would just stare at the doors, waiting for them to close up again. 
[01:54:00]  I would just take the trains that went directly through and never didn't have to transfer.  But all Long Island kids know what I'm talking about with those doors opening at Jamaica Station.  You're like, what the fuck is coming on this train right now?  Not Jamaica.  That could hurt me.  Yes.  Oh, listen to this guy.  All right.  We've got to let you go there.  All right.  Godspeed.  Go West Marie, man.  Go West Marie.  All right.  Nice little tip.  Good luck.  Enjoy your vacation, guys. 
[01:54:30]  Thank you, buddy.  There's the clip.  They're playing it on CNN of Michael Jackson.  See if it's safe.  I think that's a really good point.  If it was something that felt exploitive.  But in this case, it felt like a total celebration.  I mean, there was Michael.  He was wearing an outfit from his dangerous days.  Get the fuck if he's exploited at this point.  No, he's dead.  He was recorded in 1991.  It's not like they tried to have somebody else recreate his voice.  But someone recreate his moves, though.  There was someone that was doing the dance moves and the hologram kind of played on top of it. 
[01:55:00]  Maybe that's just the newer version of when Natalie Cole sang with her dad.  That was a sort of more, you know, first-generation technology of it.  This is the newer version.  I guess you could look at it that way, couldn't you?  Exactly.  And the thing is, is that they started working on this apparently.  No, about Michael Jackson.  They were inventing the technology to do it.  But they actually worked with the choreographers that Michael Jackson had worked with for many years.  So that wasn't Jackson dancing?  No.  They had a performer dancing using his moves. 
[01:55:30]  But that looks like Jackson's face.  And then they had his image on him.  So that's why he looked a little bit, like, meatier than I remember him.  Because it wasn't him.  It was a different guy.  Has there been any reaction from the Jackson family?  Have you heard any?  Oh, good question.  They were really supportive of it.  What's that to you, Bonnie?  What's that to you?  They were really supportive of it, thinking they could make another fortune.  The state is fully behind this.  I mean, why wouldn't Michael Jackson's family love him?  They would only be supportive if they knew there was money in it for that.  And he's gained $600 million since he passed away.  So, if I was going to say, there's another song from his album, Love Never Felt So Good with JT. 
[01:56:00]  He's worth more dead, you know that?  There's funds being generated.  People are still enjoying his music.  You get to, it's as though he's here, except not.  Kate makes a good point, though.  It's going to be how much is too much.  Like, if they say there's going to be a new tour with MJ to push his new album.  I hear you.  MJ.  Yeah, that would be very interesting.  But he does have a new album out this week, Escape.  And it's number one on the charts.  Michael Jackson's hologram paid an unspecified settlement for molesting a child's hologram.  Bonnie Fuller, HollywoodLife.com, thanks so much for joining us.  Thanks, Bonnie.  Thank you. 
[01:56:30]  Thanks, Bonnie Fuller.  We do have some breaking news for you.  The U.S. is charging Chinese officials with cyber espionage.  Have me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  There's no breaking news anymore.  Shut up.  No.  So what are some of the names from these stupid animals?  Oh, yeah.  Stupid animals.  Broomspun.  Yeah.  Majestic Prince.  Oh, that sounds like a winner.  Bimelech.  How has that not been used yet?  Majestic Prince.  Right.  Well, that was back in when? 
[01:57:00]  69.  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  War Cloud.  I don't remember War Cloud.  19, what?  18, I believe that.  18, 18.  Yeah.  I get that.  Duke of Magenta.  You are the Duke of Magenta.  Native Dancer.  Hmm.  Damn Rush.  These names are whatever.  Nah, they're not that fair.  Forget it.  These are the winners, though.  Okay.  Let's say hi to Mike in Rockland.  Mike.  Mike.  What's going on, fellas?  I was a farrier, so what we do is work on horses. 
[01:57:30]  Could you whisper?  It sounds cooler if you guys whisper the horse shit.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't hear you.  All right.  You're with that, though, Smith.  Go ahead.  So we work on horses, and you don't need the horse taking their shoes off with their  shoes on, and the stallions would just be leaking cum all over the place.  Your shoes on your pants.  Here comes the pre.  On your hands.  Ah, you just get cum all over you?  You just try to change their shoes and they're cum?  Or my buddy would be under the horse and he'd get all over his arm and he'd just come up 
[01:58:00]  behind me and wipe it on the side of my face.  A farrier.  Are these horses aware that they're running these big races?  Or are they just animals in the end?  I feel bad for them, man.  I think they could run them to the ground, so I don't know.  I gotta go.  Try not to die.  Oh, what are you fucking...  All right.  Showing a horse?  No, no.  There he goes.  What happened?  Nothing.  What happened?  What are you whispering about?  I don't like it.  I'm just trying to figure out a situation with a guest. 
[01:58:30]  What guest?  Exactly.  We have a surprise guest?  Looking at the sheet.  Oh, no.  Apparently.  All right.  Who's here?  Well, I mean, it's not bad.  It's not a bad guest.  We'd be happy.  We don't want any guests.  Write it down.  All right.  Jot it down.  I think you'll be fine.  Another fake booking?  No.  None of us know who booked it.  What?  Oh, yeah.  That's fine.  Yeah, of course.  We're just all trying to figure out how it happened. 
[01:59:00]  Fake Roland?  That would be too funny.  Did fake Roland do it again?  I blocked that cunt.  You did?  Yeah.  Yeah, I just blocked him, too.  Enough.  I blocked him, too.  Enough.  I'm blocking everybody.  Like I said, Twitter's just a shitty place.  I don't have time for any of that crap anymore.  So when is he coming in?  Soon?  According to his Twitter, in about an hour.  Nice.  Yeah.  I mean, it's good news.  We're just trying to...  I was just...  We were talking to Travis and texting Roland and stuff, trying to figure out if somebody 
[01:59:30]  had done it without saying it.  I think we all saw something at the same time.  Yeah.  And so we were just trying to figure out how.  It's got to be fake.  You think it's fake Roland?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Roland would have said something.  I mean, it's good news.  Yeah.  Because that's one of the...  We'd actually be happy that he's here.  We probably should take a break to try to figure it out, I'm thinking.  All righty.  What?  Yeah, we're going to take a break to try to figure it out.  We should try to figure it out.  We're just going to try to figure it all out.  I could just leave the room.  No, we should break and figure it out, I think. 
[02:00:00]  Let's do that.  Yeah, we should do that.  I mean, you need a...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I was...  I mean, you guys are just going to sit here.  We're going to go and figure it out anyway.  Yeah.  And we'll talk about Vince when we get back.  All right.  And laugh at his misfortunes.  Relax.  The Opie and Anthony Show will be right back on Sirius XM.  Celebrating the king of power.

With the creepy old guy staring.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Let me show you how to make a big boy love ya.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul reminisces about a young Macaulay Culkin in the movie My Girl. 
[02:08:00]  I was crying a lot in the theater when I seen that one.  Ah, ha, ha.  I couldn't see through my tears.  I had such a big lump in my sweatpants.  I love that movie.  Look at that, you're all rough, you got leaves on ya.  Come here, let me muss your hair up.  Come here, Macaulay.  Look at your denim coat.  I cried so hard.  He got the bees all over him.  I was like, be careful!  They're gonna start stinging on your penis. 
[02:08:30]  Gotta get someone to suck the person out.  You got little bee stingers in your penis.  Why don't you come over here?  Let me get the bee stingers.  You beast, let me pull him out with my teeth.  I'll rescue you.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul, now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul. 
[02:09:00]  They're rich, rich, rich, and they pee.  But they're done.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  You're just a picture.  You're in your face, caution time.  Nice.  Fucking love this song. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  Now we're talking. 
[02:10:00]  Just a rainbow in the dark.  9-11 Museum has a gift shop.  No surprise there.  No.  That's not a surprise.  No.  It's something we brought up on the show, I don't know, at least 15 years ago at this point,  where enough time goes by and it just becomes whatever.  Exactly.  No offense to people that were directly affected by 9-11, but all you have to do is look at  the whole Titanic thing and now it's a ride that you could rent for your kids' party 
[02:10:30]  and put it up in the backyard.  We actually had one of those Titanic things at our celebrity softball game, remember?  Yes.  We put it in right field or something, I believe, and it was just out there.  Yeah, and now they've got the 9-11 Museum and, of course, they've got a gift shop, which  is really, really strange.  And what can you get at the gift shop?  What kind of stuff?  You can get a FDNY Rescue dog vest.  Oh.  Put it on your little doggy.  Why don't you get that trap?  Like the ones that probably went in there to look at all the bodies. 
[02:11:00]  Okay, got it.  Good.  Good.  For $25, you can get a 10th anniversary flag of honor.  A 10th anniversary flag of honor.  It's just a flag, but it's got to be a flag of honor because they're selling it basically  in a mass grave.  So when you're selling a flag in a mass grave, it has to say flag of honor to be dignified.  Right.  These are rocks.  These are heart-shaped stones with messages of hope on them for $39.  What's good?  A $39 rock.  Like the rubble?  Yeah, what kind of messages of hope on there? 
[02:11:30]  No day shall phase you from the memory of time.  That's right.  We remember because we're selling this on a mass grave.  Wow.  United in hope.  Who's behind the museum?  It's not the government?  No, it's a private.  I think it's been privatized.  And the excuse they're using is, well, the money goes to sustain the museum and the victims.  I don't give a fuck where the money goes.  The money to the victims' families, this is one of those things where the government should  foot the bill because it was an attack on the U.S. 
[02:12:00]  Right.  So I don't mind my taxes going up a little bit if I know it's being used to fund the  college tuitions of the children of 9-11 victims.  Sure.  Or to sustain this museum, which should be sustained by the government.  How about you give $1 billion less to some dog coffee cup?  Yeah, just something you can remember every morning with the 9-11 memorial coffee mug.  Yeah.  How about giving a billion dollars less to some country that fucking is disgusting or  some shitty rebels that are going to turn on us anyway, and you use it to fund something 
[02:12:30]  like this?  Yeah.  I have no problem with it.  And there are people definitely profiting on this.  9-11 coffee mug.  Definitely.  That's good.  Don't get caught in the next dust storm without a 9-11 memorial cap.  Oh, good.  That's right.  You want that.  It's only $19.95 for a limited time.  Cool.  Great.  Mass grave hat.  Yes.  Yes.  And of course, the t-shirt.  The t-shirt.  Wait, wait.  Where's the jumper?  Remember the falling man?  Oh, well, there you go.  Where's the falling man poster?  Oh, boy.  I would love to.  How about a falling man poster? 
[02:13:00]  Well, that wouldn't be very nice, would it, Jim?  Well, how about a falling man, like a cup with a falling man on it?  And as you turn it, his falling progress.  Oh, that would be interesting.  Remember those pens that you could turn upside down and the clothes would come off?  Right.  What if the man falls off the building when you turn the pen upside down?  Oh, that's great.  Probably be a big seller down there.  But if you turn it upside down, he goes back up to the top of the building, and you're like,  oh, that worked out nicely.  Start over again.  There you go.  Well, you can get the two towers on a hoodie.  Jesus.  Wow.  That's disgusting.  We used to attack, verbally bash those guys outside that sold pictures of the burning buildings. 
[02:13:30]  Right.  These people are just as...  I don't care where the money goes.  The government should be taking care of that.  For $95, you can have a silk scarf with the towers on it.  Oh, that's delightful.  Yes, a silk scarf.  On fire or before they were attacked?  It was right before they were attacked, so they're not on fire yet.  Thank God.  Photo taken on 910.  Yes.  That's great.  Yes.  Good, good, good.  Perfect.  Cool.  Wow.  Cool.  So you're not for this gift shop, Jim? 
[02:14:00]  It makes me fucking sick to my stomach, because I hate when the government takes over and  does shit, and I think privatizing things is good, but in this case, when the country  is attacked, this is in disgusting taste.  Remember right after 9-11, a lot of those sidewalk vendors were selling photographs of  the World Trade Center on fire and all that shit, and then they were getting the shit beat  out of them?  I just said that.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  I was trying to get my pal Tog working on it. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, really?  I understand.  See?  But, uh, yeah, yeah, they got the shit beat out of them, yeah.  For $15, all the kids can get an FDNY toy vehicle set.  Great.  Little matchbox fire trucks.  In good shape or crushed?  Yeah.  Are they smashed?  Let me look at these.  Oh, no, no, no.  These are on their way to the towers, so they're not all crushed yet.  Cool.  So the ones they're selling in the mass grave for the kids are not going to be crushed.  Got it.  Not yet.  A couple people who got really mad on Twitter, and the ones who were like, cool. 
[02:15:00]  They're getting mad at your opinion on this?  Well, a couple of them were like, yeah, but is this different than Gettysburg?  And they asked questions, so I kind of went back and forth with them.  But the ones who were angry, like, I don't know who you're fucking, blocked, cunt.  I don't care who you are or how you're related to this.  Go fuck yourself.  What was the argument?  There's no surprise here.  Enough time goes by, this shit happens.  It's going to the...  What are we up to now?  Like 12 years, right?  What was the argument with Gettysburg?  Well, they were saying, how come it's okay at Gettysburg?  And, like, I understood the point of that.  Yeah.  And my point was simply, like, I get the inconsistency in the thinking, but it is different, and 
[02:15:30]  you know it's different.  Ah.  You can't pretend that Gettysburg carries the same emotional weight right now that this  does.  And maybe in a court of law, you would win, but you know the difference.  I think when people are still alive, that we're directly affected with the event.  Maybe when a generation passes, then maybe.  I don't know.  You're right.  It's just too close.  Pearl Harbor memorabilia.  I'm sure that on the Arizona Memorial, there are Arizona, USS Arizona souvenirs. 
[02:16:00]  Maybe there's something about the fact that it was a military action, military actions.  There's something about that, a little different than civilians being massacred.  But then people raise the Holocaust, and there's a Holocaust museum, and a non-frank museum,  and maybe they have a gift shop, too.  It's one of those too-soons.  It just feels like it's too soon.  It just really bothers me, because I think it's just sick of it.  You know all this goes in this direction eventually, but this one seems a little too soon, right? 
[02:16:30]  You can get United We Stand a United We Stand blanket.  It's just that same fucking fake, feel-good, bullshit patriotism that doesn't last.  You know, freedom, the freedom tower.  Oh, fuck you.  One world trade.  That's all I call it.  I will never call it the freedom tower.  It's a dumb, forced, fake name.  It's so hack.  It really is.  It really bugs me.  We're a bunch of hacks in the end.  Maybe the admission I understand. 
[02:17:00]  The freedom tower.  Because we're so free in America.  You are so free.  Okay.  Are we?  Are we really that free in America?  Go down to the freedom tower.  Oh, it's not free.  That's right.  Right.  Maybe the admission makes sense, even though I don't like it.  But all right, they keep a certain amount of people in at a time and keeps it organized.  But isn't the Museum of Natural History just a suggested donation?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  But they have it set up in such a way you feel incredibly guilty if you don't pay. 
[02:17:30]  If you don't pay.  But you don't have to pay.  Because they roll their eyes.  Because I've gone there so many times.  After a while, I'm like, I don't feel like fucking giving the suggested anymore.  I've been in this damn place a million times with my kid and stuff.  So I'm like anyone else.  I'll skinflin a little bit.  And they roll their eyes.  And I once said to a lady, like, oh, really?  I bet if you were on this side of the counter, you would try to, like, you know, pay the least amount possible.  What?  Because you have the authority for the next hour?  You're going to roll your eyes. 
[02:18:00]  But when you're a civilian, you're going to do the exact same shit we're trying to do here.  What's the suggested entry for a Museum of Natural History?  It's up there.  It's like 20-something bucks or something.  Look at dinosaurs.  It's free.  Yeah.  But if they have it, it says admission.  I don't know exactly.  But it says something like admission in a big letter with the $23 or whatever it is.  But right above that, it says suggested in the tiniest font possible.  I'm going to suggest a nickel.  It's $22.  $22.  $22.  Okay, yeah.  $22 less than the 9-11 Museum. 
[02:18:30]  Right.  What are you going to do?  You know, they've got to fucking strip those bones down somehow.  No, I've paid.  The money goes to the Mastodon's family.  Dude, I've paid the suggested.  But when you go a lot, you start going, really, I'm going to just throw another $150, you know, because you bring people and stuff.  And, of course, because you're the one that fucking makes the money.  You've got to pay for everybody.  It's got to, you know.  I understand they have to, there has to be some maintenance there.  Like, where's that money coming from with the Museum of Natural History? 
[02:19:00]  No, but they guilt you into it, is my point.  They look at you like you're a scumbag.  I don't mind them charging.  You really want to only pay $5 when it's, we're suggesting $22.  I don't mind the History Museum charging.  There's something about, I used to go to these buildings when they were there for free.  Hold on, they're not charging.  You could technically go into the museum and not pay.  You could say, I have decided I'm going in for free today.  And there's nothing they could do about it.  But then they get you at the special exhibits. 
[02:19:30]  It's the reason why you go to the museum.  Like, oh, they've got a special exhibit on NASA or whatever.  Or those, you have to pay to go and see.  But I would say, no, it wouldn't even bother me if they charged for those.  Because, you know, that's a museum, it's nice.  But this is fucking, they were free to go to when they were standing.  They get knocked down.  Bureaucracy keeps them.  13 years later, still not completely built.  And we have to pay.  There's just something annoying about that.  And it's not the money, it's just the idea of it.  This guy was at the memorial. 
[02:20:00]  All right, hold on.  Frank from the Bronx.  I think he's a regular, too.  Hey, Frank.  What's up, boys?  How you doing?  Hi, Frank.  All right, man.  What do you got on this?  So they're comparing it to the other museum in natural history.  How can they compare it, first off?  I was at the damn thing.  The gift shop is the most tackiest.  They're silk scars for $49.99.  I mean, it's the most ridiculous thing in the world.  And right next to you is where they have the leftover unknown body parts, basically, probably 100 yards to your right from the gift shop. 
[02:20:30]  You tell me.  Somebody tell me what the hell, what the fuck is going on right now.  They're pigs.  When we were watching Jumpers and there was a body hitting the ground, did you ever think that 13 years later, where that body splashed, right under there, you'll be able to buy a silk scarf with a tower on each one.  Yeah.  Remember, remember.  Oh, it's fucking shit.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  Shit.  And then the one thing that, you know, the Statue of Liberty, why would they have little statuettes of the Statue of Liberty in a 9-11 museum?  I don't understand it.  If that's not, let's order a whole bunch of shit from China and let's pack it up because we can't make more money on it.  It probably is made in fucking, made in Saudi Arabia.  It's gross.  Oh, it's just ridiculous.  It's just ridiculous.  But, I mean, Jimmy, I love your passion about it. 
[02:21:30]  I can't agree with you more.  Thank you.  I mean, I'd like to get, I'd get that jumper pin that you turn upside down and then at the bottom of it you see him hitting the floor.  That sounds like a good, I'd pay $10 for that.  But that's not that outrageous.  It's not as too far-fetched considering what they are selling down there.  They might as well go all in and give you a little, like, thing of the remains.  Oh, that'd be a...  Some of the rubble, you know what I mean?  Very tacky.  Like when they knocked down the wall over there in Berlin.  Right.  They were selling pieces of the wall. 
[02:22:00]  They might as well sell pieces of the rubble.  Like when Yankee Stadium...  Rubble, excuse me.  And everybody got some dirt.  Right.  The sand at Yankee Stadium, the DNA from the Trade Center.  That's what we're going to tell.  Well, how about this?  $99.99.  No paper.  You've got foreigners taking pictures in front of it like it's a happy toy.  I think Brandon Steiner's got a new business.  Yeah, he sure does.  He's probably got a dump truck and he's just trying to get as much of the rubble as possible.  Yeah, victim hair.  We have victim hair and dirt behind a piece of ice glass for you to take home. 
[02:22:30]  But it has an inspirational message on it.  Right, right.  So it's okay.  If they did it like you have to order something online, why not do it online?  Make people order this shit online.  Because there's something about them hawking it or hawking it, whatever the word is, right there  that is so fucking disgusting.  Yeah, yeah.  It's disgusting.  It is.  If you call now, we'll double your order.  All you have to do is pay extra shipping and handling.  Absolutely. 
[02:23:00]  Get actual audio screams captured on cassette tape.  For your cell phone.  Take a look at the airplane, the second airplane.  Look at the view that we have here.  It's beautiful.  Yeah, we got you.  It approaches the building.  I think we got it.  That's all right, guys.  Sorry.  No worries.  Thanks.  I'll throw it with a Derek Cedar rookie card.  All right, Frank.  There he goes.  He's trying to get that going.  Thank you, buddy.  Frank E.  He's trying to get that going.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's disgusting.  Even if the money goes to the victim's trust.  I'm not saying they're profiting off it. 
[02:23:30]  Somebody's making a few bucks off that.  Somebody.  That shit always trickles down to somebody.  An administrator has to get paid.  Somebody is making actual money off that.  I guarantee it.  I guarantee it.  Is anybody disagreeing?  On Twitter, they were disagreeing.  So does anybody have a point, like, reason they're disagreeing?  Disagreeing?  They disagree on Twitter because Twitter is a shitty place.  Just because they can.  Because it's a shitty place.  This is reality right here.  We don't have one guy disagreeing. 
[02:24:00]  The disagreement would be the inconsistency thing with, like, you said, Gettysburg and, you know, the Titanic, things like that.  But you weren't even talking about those other gift shops.  They brought it up.  Right.  Yeah.  But I understand the comparison to Gettysburg.  If anyone wants to argue the point and they bring up that point, it's kind of, it's a legitimate argument.  It just seems to feel a little better if a lot of time has gone by.  Right.  For whatever reason.  For whatever reason.  I don't really, you know.  Right.  Well, it's the same reason. 
[02:24:30]  I can't really explain it fully, but.  It's the same reason, you know, on TV they'll show bodies from World War II in the most horrifically mangled fashion.  Right.  Because of, you know, World War II.  But they won't show something from now.  You know, they'll show some things, but never to the magnitude that they show bodies of World War II victims.  Maybe because you feel like, well.  It's black and white.  Enough time went by.  Enough time went by.  If he wasn't killed in World War II, he would have lived his life by now. 
[02:25:00]  I don't know.  I don't know what it is that happens in your brain.  It's just something.  You're detached from that moment more so than you are from 9-11.  So, it's.  Yes, Trav?  The Holocaust Museum has a gift shop.  It does.  Yeah, in D.C.  See, that's an.  You know what?  It feels kind of weird.  It didn't happen in D.C.  That's one thing.  And, again, enough time went by.  And I don't think.  I don't think.  But is there a Holocaust Museum at Auschwitz, which I do want to go to? 
[02:25:30]  There are.  Maybe there is.  You can go there and see.  I don't know if there's a gift shop or anything.  Laszlo said he went.  It was real creepy.  Yeah, I do want to see that, though.  It's really.  Like, he thought, like, oh, cool.  You know, I'm going to go there.  I'm going to see part of history.  It's kind of cool.  Right.  And then he got there and thought, like, oh, my God.  This is the most depressing place I've ever been.  Right.  I remember.  So there's just a vibe about the place that is just pure, depressing evil.  Ugh.  Yeah.  I think there's a bookshop.  A bookshop. 
[02:26:00]  Bookshop's not as bad.  That's not bad.  As a fucking dumb hat.  Scarps.  9-11 Memorial hat.  Actually, get me my scarf.  Who would wear a scarf for the towers?  One to your right, one to your left.  Really?  It's fucking sickening.  Let's go to Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  Hey there, Paul.  He might have info on people making money off this.  Go ahead, Paul.  Before I get to that, I've been to Dachau.  And like you just said, there is a bookshop there.  A bookshop.  I don't remember anything really stupid being sold there. 
[02:26:30]  That's legit, though.  And that sounds like an electric train set or anything, right?  That would be very tasteless.  Easy-bake ovens or something.  Things like that, right.  Very tasteless.  Not good.  Sure thing.  I don't know.  I read over the weekend where the head of the commission is making $378,000.  And number two...  Wait, who's making that?  Head of the commission that runs it.  See, I told you.  It does trickle down because you've got to pay people.  Well, does he have other things that he does?  Like, is this just one of his jobs or is this his only gig? 
[02:27:00]  I think it's his only job.  He has the entire 9-11 Memorial commission.  Now, Jimmy, I've got a question for you.  It's a career for people.  They are making a good living off this.  Yes, and then their excuse would be, well, someone's got to organize this, and it takes  time and my efforts and blah, blah, blah.  That's a lot of money.  What's your question?  That seems to be a lot.  Who's going to be the first one to spoof this?  Where, you know, I could see the Amy Schumer type sketch where she's walking in and they  do have pictures of the towers on fire. 
[02:27:30]  They do have pictures where you can buy the rubble.  He's pitching an idea.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's a good idea.  It's a very funny idea.  I mean, for a sketch, SNL wouldn't do it, but they should do it.  They wouldn't do it.  They don't want to go to the balls or something like that.  Right.  Well, I mean, that's a hard one to tackle because, you know, even though you're being  really sarcastic and attacking the idea of the museum, if it's misinterpreted, you know.  And just doing it conjures up, you know.  Right.  It's like, ah, this is taboo. 
[02:28:00]  You shouldn't.  But it should, though.  Like, it really is revolting.  What they're doing is not just shitty.  It's revolting.  It's revolting.  Yeah.  Right.  All right, Paul.  I agree.  I have one more question.  It's kind of off topic.  I've been wondering about for a while.  Sure.  I go way back with you guys.  The second week of WNEW.  Oh, where were the first week?  Over the last 20 years, you guys have talked about every single member that's ever been  a part of the staff, except for one guy, which I never hear you mention anymore, and  that's Spaz.  You guys really not like him? 
[02:28:30]  No, we've talked about him a lot.  Yeah, he's been come up a lot, actually.  We've talked about him plenty.  Spaz went on to...  Spaz was one of the most amazing...  Hilarious.  ...characters we've ever had on our show.  It was unbelievable, the stuff he would come up with and did for our show.  And one day, he came to me and Ann, and he didn't want to be Spaz anymore.  Yeah, he wanted to be...  What was his name?  Kevin.  Kevin.  And I sat him down, and I'm like, are you kidding me?  This is killing.  Yeah.  But he didn't want to be the...  I want to be Kevin.  He wanted to be Kevin, and he wanted to continue, and we're like, well, all right, but there's 
[02:29:00]  no money in it for you to be Kevin.  People want you to continue as Spaz, and Spaz was him.  That's the weird part.  He wasn't putting on a character.  We say one of the most amazing characters ever, but that was him.  That was him.  He wasn't this Kevin guy, which was his real name.  What, did his girlfriend push him into it?  Then he tried to sue us.  Another one that tried to sue us.  Another guy that leaves here and then has to trash the shit out of us. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  What did he want?  Because we didn't give him a good opportunity or something.  Oh, no.  Did he really?  Yeah.  I forgot that he tried to sue us.  I remember he moved like two hours away, and you guys used to ridicule him every day because  he would have like a two-hour trip in.  Sloatsburg.  Yeah, he literally spent half his day just coming to the city.  He's a cop now up in Sloatsburg.  Is that real?  Yeah, yeah.  I would love to see a picture of him.  I have never heard him mentioned ever since he left.  No, we have talked about him.  Because I didn't really know Spaz, and I know a lot about the situation, and I've heard 
[02:30:00]  it on the air.  Yeah, he comes up.  Me and Opie usually will send a text to each other whenever one of us reads something  that he had predicted years ago that actually comes to fruition.  That's what's so creepy.  There's so many of those dumb things where he was like, you know, people will be being  operated on by robots.  Right.  And we're like, ah, Spaz, you idiot.  And then it's like, robot doctors operate.  And I'm like, I fire up and text Opie, you see this shit?  Or kitty litter to absorb hurricanes. 
[02:30:30]  Right.  And they're working on, like, trying to figure out how to lessen the strength of hurricanes.  Of hurricanes by dropping super absorbent material like the fucking kitty litter.  Right.  The guy had fucking...  He had some ideas.  Or the pointing the microwave at tornadoes, the microwave ovens.  Right.  He said, if everybody points a microwave oven at a tornado, it would stop the tornado.  And it's like, and then I read, stopping tornadoes with microwaves.  Like, fuck, Opie.  That's so weird.  Maybe he was a weird savant, like, technological genius or something. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, well...  Or just an absolute idiot.  Like, if you put a million monkeys in front of a million typewriters, one of them will hit  the Bible.  Yeah.  One of my favorites was when he said that he could break into any safe, I think it was.  The perfect crime.  And then we hung him from the ceiling.  In a Spider-Man outfit.  In a Spider-Man outfit.  And gave him the whole show to try to break into the safe.  You have to cut a perfectly symmetricized hole.  Right.  What an idiot.  But what was his thing about breaking into safes? 
[02:31:30]  I forget now.  It's been so long.  He said that he could, like, pick the lock.  Oh, he could hear it or something.  Yeah, he'd hear the tumblers.  And he never...  So we were able to get a safe.  We got a whole, like, special effects team.  Spider spaz.  We hung him from...  We hung him from the ceiling.  Made him try to...  But in that Mission Impossible way.  Yeah, yeah.  He was like...  Yeah, we wanted it to be like Mission Impossible.  Right.  So he was perfectly balanced.  Like, these guys worked hard to make sure he hung from the ceiling perfectly.  What's he look like?  Is there a picture of him?  I don't even know what he looks like. 
[02:32:00]  He's like a crazy-looking ginger.  There he is.  Wow.  That was a killer mosquito.  Looks like Macklemore.  Oh, yeah.  But he was really, like, just incredibly naive.  One time, we were talking about tampons.  He didn't understand girls and their tampons or something.  Oh, my God.  Right.  So we put him in the bathroom.  Do we have that clip, E-Rock?  And he screamed.  It's a great clip.  He screamed when he figured out where the tampons went or something.  Where the tampon went and what they were for.  Right.  And then he saw her take one out and throw it in the toilet, and he screamed. 
[02:32:30]  If E-Rock could find that clip, that's pretty amazing.  That was funny, man.  It was going to be on our cringe CD that the lawyer said no to.  We don't have many spaz clips in Dillette, but I was just previewing the giant mosquito.  Oh, yeah.  It's still funny.  Well, we can play it until break.  Encephalitis.  Who cares?  No, I don't care.  Encephalitis.  That's when I stopped, and I was like, all right, this is still good.  Yeah, he just moved on.  He just finally just moved on, and that was it.  I don't know.  Oh, God. 
[02:33:00]  He was with Beba.  Beba.  Beba.  Did they ever get married?  No.  He didn't marry Beba?  No, Beba ended up, him and Beba ended up breaking up.  Okay.  And then Beba married that sick boy guy.  Oh, the rest?  Oh, the guy that got us in trouble with The Rock.  Yeah.  All right.  And then I hear tell they've since divorced.  Oh.  Beba?  Was her name B-A-B-E-A?  No.  He called her Beba.  Beba.  Beba.  Instead of saying baby, he was like, hey, Beba. 
[02:33:30]  So we would call her Beba.  Beba.  Beba.  Is that him?  That's The Rock walking out on our show.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Wait.  The Rock says.  Wait.  Go back.  Was the guy in studio?  Yes.  This is all I.  Sick boy.  Yeah.  Because he wanted to.  Appreciate you guys having me on.  Thank you.  Okay.  Book signing starting at 7 tonight.  Tower Records.  East 4th Street.  And I'm still plugging as shit.  In the East Village.  Got to thank The Rock for stopping on by today. 
[02:34:00]  Appreciate it.  And he walked out.  Why don't we have the part where.  I don't know.  I don't even know how they got this.  I don't know what it is.  And then we were probably like.  Ah, fuck The Rock.  He's never going to amount to anything anyway.  Well, I didn't say that on our show.  I said we would always be bigger than him.  Oh, no.  I did say that.  Oops.  You know, WWE, I found out, recently went into full recovery mode when The Rock walked  out.  Like, they were pissed that he walked out because they cared so much about your show. 
[02:34:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were pretty important to the WWE after that.  That's The Rock.  Apparently, that's why they flew you to California for WrestleMania and all that.  Oh, yeah.  Anaheim.  Yeah.  I still got the chairs.  I don't know.  Who has mine?  I don't.  I don't have chairs from that WrestleMania.  Really?  They gave it to somebody.  That was the 2000 WrestleMania?  Yeah.  I still got the chairs.  Yeah.  You've got to give that to Sam.  Fuck that.  It's in my basement.  Would you want that, Sam?  It's in my bar.  Yeah, I have a collection of chairs.  From WrestleMania? 
[02:35:00]  Well, from various events.  You have a collection of chairs.  I'll give him one if I could smash it over his head.  Cushion sign or steel sign?  Steel sign.  All right.  I'm going to smash you in the face of it.  What's the rarest wrestling thing you own?  For our wedding, Jess gave me a worn gold dust outfit.  Oh, shit.  For your wedding?  Yeah.  Did you have to wear it during your honeymoon?  Did you leave a pre-cum into it?  No.  Did you like it?  I was there for the unveiling, and man, was Sam excited. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, I bet.  It was the after party at the bar, right?  Yeah.  Was there a skid mark in the back from gold dust?  No, but the crotch of it is worn out.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  Why?  That's how I knew it was real.  Do you smell it?  No.  It's not about that.  It's not a Shane McMahon bachelor party shirt, but...  Oh, that's true.  You got that.  You just asked me that question so you could brag about your Shane McMahon.  No, I forgot about that.  I actually forgot about that.  Oh, probably.  The SS Shane McMahon.  All right, Paul.  Thanks for the call, buddy.  Sure.  All right.  Let's see. 
[02:36:00]  10,000.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Bobby in Kentucky.  Bobby.  Hey there, Bobby.  Hey, gentlemen.  Hey, Bobby.  This gift shop thing is not as sick as, I don't know, bringing a victim's shoe to the  oddest things you own in Cleveland.  Yeah, I got to be honest with you.  That happened in Chicago.  We did the oddest thing you own, and I think it was a girl.  She actually brought a shoe from 9-11.  She did.  And that never sat well with me. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, it was a weird thing.  That never sat well with me.  There was something extremely creepy about it.  I forget how we played it on the air, to be honest with you, but I remember after the  show, I was like, man, there was something just not right about that.  Yeah, because, you know, someone's fucking shoe was probably dead.  Right.  Was she the one that was complaining that she didn't win?  Yeah, yeah, and then she's complaining.  I think we just didn't want any part of it, so we...  I don't know, maybe someone had something better.  I don't even remember what won.  I don't remember that at all.  But I do remember...  I was drunk. 
[02:37:00]  I do remember we were all just like, wow, that's fucking dark.  I remember all the papers that were all over New York City, like in Brooklyn even, there  was just papers from the Trade Center, all just fucking work papers, and they were stuck  to the fences, like, because the wind would blow them, and they would just, like, sit  on the fence.  All over Manhattan.  All over, like Brooklyn, too.  Yeah, miles away.  Went across the water.  Miles away, the paper was.  And there was something that's like, oh, you know, I want to check that out.  I want to look at... 
[02:37:30]  And then you just get creeped out.  It's like, nah, you know what?  I don't know.  I have a piece of paper from it.  It was...  Voss, at the time, was, like, knew some girl.  We went down, and she was a volunteer, so we put on masks and went on the site, and she  had saved a few things from it, like, just papers and things, and she gave me one.  It was just, like, from somebody's office.  It was a weird...  No, I didn't feel weird taking it, though.  It's a piece of history, I thought.  Right.  Yeah.  And, yeah, I had it framed at one point.  Oh, man.  Everything you get is framed, though. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  Uh, this is one of the guys that...  Yeah.  Uh, thank you, Bobby.  Let's go to Tim in New York.  I think this is one of the guys you blocked over that whole discussion.  Tim.  Oh.  Yeah, no, I just said that to cut the line.  I have nothing to contribute.  Slobo!  Oh.  There you go.  A little Slobo, uh, action for you.  Oh, boy.  All right.  At least he said he had nothing to contribute, and he came through. 
[02:38:30]  Right.  With nothing.  So what's up with this Vince McMahon thing?  He lost 43...  No.  The stock lost 43%.  Oh.  Yeah, and one day...  On Friday?  On Friday, Vince McMahon lost $357 million.  Wow.  Himself.  Taking him out of the billionaire category.  He's not a billionaire.  Okay, job!  Oh, work!  Right.  I sound like Arthur.  Uh-huh.  That's the point.  He lost $357 million in one day. 
[02:39:00]  That's a lot of money.  In one day.  Holy...  It serves him right.  Why?  He should pay his wrestlers better.  Oh.  A lot of them make a lot of money.  Nah, I've been hearing the stories lately, man.  And I'm surprised at some of the numbers those guys were making at the height of their popularity.  And to know that he has $357 million to lose.  Like, his lifestyle will not change whatsoever after losing $357 million in one day.  You feel that.  Holy fuck, does he feel that. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, but imagine if you were...  What does he feel, though?  Imagine if you were a billionaire, and you walk around being like, I'm a fucking billionaire.  Right.  And then you're not.  And not only are you not, you're $357 million shy of being a billionaire.  Take whatever percentage of that out of your bank.  Oh, I understand.  It would be a little tragic.  He got greedy.  Wall Street gave him the stink face.  That's what it was.  Yeah.  It's a Wall Street stink face.  Wall Street.  Wall Street stink face.  Put him in the fucking turnbuckle, pulled their pants down, and shoved their ass right 
[02:40:00]  against his face.  Are you saying that Wall Street inducted him into the Kiss My Ass Club?  Yes, they did.  Kiss my ass!  Yes.  Yes, they did.  So what was the deal?  What deal did he fuck up?  He didn't fuck up, man.  He doesn't fuck up deals.  He fucked up a deal.  This is all about fucking up a deal.  Are you kidding me?  He, from what I've read, he came out before the TV deal was signed and said the next TV  deal we sign is going to be this incredible thing. 
[02:40:30]  Right.  And he had big Vince McMahon-sized expectations that all the investors had.  So all the investors are buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, and then on Friday they announced their  TV deal with NBCUniversal.  They're staying on all the same channels.  It's not a bad deal, but it's not...  It doesn't equal his hype.  Right.  What kind of deal were they thinking he was going to make?  I mean, they were thinking he was going to...  That they were freaking out and buying like they were.  Like he was talking about, I think that they were thinking he was going to triple his fees 
[02:41:00]  that he got.  See, here's the deal.  If you're a CEO like this, Vince McMahon, you know, is a voice, he's the voice of WWE,  you can't hype up shit.  The market always knows, like, when you get a corporation that has these, you know, CEOs  that speak, they always play it down.  Well, we're a little concerned about next quarter's numbers.  We're hopefully optimistic and things like that. 
[02:41:30]  And then when they have good numbers, the stock takes off.  If you're hyping like Vince does, thinking he's in the ring with a mic, and then it doesn't  come through to the expectations of the stockholders, it takes a shit.  Plus, that was coming off the network, where investors thought the network was going to  have a million subscribers, and when they announced their numbers in April, it had just under  700,000 subscribers.  So they're short about 33% there, which is a big...  Three million a month, let's fuck up with 30 million. 
[02:42:00]  About, what would it really, a little more, whatever.  Huh, that's a big difference.  Yeah, so that's on the heels of the network.  Heels!  That's right.  Heels.  Heels, nice.  Oh, I get it.  Baby face heel.  Baby faces in this shit.  Wordplay humor.  Fuck yeah, what are you, a heel or something?  So yeah, Vince McMahon is no longer a...  No longer a billionaire.  Aw, poor Vince.  I can't imagine he was easy to deal with.  Do you think he was cranky?  I think he might have been.  Name five people that are happy about this. 
[02:42:30]  I would think Eric Bischoff.  Eric Bischoff is one.  Ted Turner is probably happy about it.  I'm very happy about it.  Ted Turner.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he owned WCW for work.  Rassler.  Who else?  Let's see.  I would say Bret Hart is probably happy about it somewhere.  All right.  Bret Hart's probably psyched.  Smiling.  Uh-huh.  Celebrating a little bit.  I think so.  Even though he's employed by that degree now.  Need two more.  I would say... 
[02:43:00]  Bob Costas is probably happy about it because the time Vince slapped the papers out of his  hand.  Yes.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah.  Did he lean in?  He leaned in.  Let me tell you something.  Right.  Right.  And who could be the fifth person?  It's got to be a good one.  John Stossel.  I'll bet CM Punk is at home happy with his decision.  Oh, okay.  What about someone like a Mick Foley?  Mick Foley isn't.  You know why?  Because Mick Foley just announced that he was not going to re-sign for his merchandising 
[02:43:30]  legends deal with WWE.  Before this, he was like, no, I'm not signing there.  Maybe he's happy.  Why isn't he re-signing?  He went on his Facebook and he said that the deals that some of the wrestlers were getting  for the video game rights were much lower than they used to be.  And his deal that he got, even though he was in the game three times, obviously, because  there's three faces of Foley, was far lower than it used to be.  And so because of stuff like that, he was not going to re-sign. 
[02:44:00]  How much do you think they get to be in a video game?  Doesn't Vince own his likeness, kind of?  How is he going to make that money back?  I think that when, I think that it's complicated.  I think the way it works is that Vince owns, Vince can use the names all he wants, and he  can use the home video and all that, but he still pays home video rights to all those  guys, even after they're out of the company.  Right.  But in terms of producing new images of them, I think they have to be on board with that. 
[02:44:30]  The people themselves.  So what do you think they get paid?  I've heard that, I think it's like 50 grand or something for a video game.  It's not that much.  You know, that's a lot of money, Anthony, you shouldn't say that's not.  And I'm assuming like somebody who could argue that, well, this video, like The Rock would  probably make a lot more than 50 grand, because he's like, well, people are buying this because  they want to be The Rock or John Cena.  Right.  But like a scrub would probably get like 50 grand.  Brooklyn Brawler? 
[02:45:00]  Brooklyn Brawler would probably get like 40 grand.  Yeah.  He probably just gets a few free copies.  Yeah.  Do you think JR, you think JR is happy?  JR is probably just, he's probably just at home in Oklahoma chuckling to himself.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Vince.  He lost a lot of money there today.  It's good shit.  It's good shit.  It's good shit.  I'm glad he lost his money.  Who knows a good wrestler?  Clubber's Shirk.  Clubber's Shirk?  Really?  I know, actually.  I mean, I'm a big wrestling guy.  I've never heard of Clubber's Shirk.  Up and comer. 
[02:45:30]  Oh.  Is that right?  Yes.  Where does he wrestle?  Everywhere.  He does the club.  That's his big finishing.  Sam, some are saying.  Yeah, what's that?  Yes.  He spins his arm in a circle in club form.  Oh.  Hits you with it.  It sounds great.  Clubber's Shirk.  Sounds like an ass.  Some are saying that the WWE stock fell quicker than Owen Hart.  Is that true?  Oh, my God.  Is that true?  Some are saying.  Some are saying.  People are saying.  You asked me if it's true.  The stock fall, it metaphorically fell, whereas Owen Hart quite literally fell. 
[02:46:00]  Literally, yes.  So you could not compare those two schemes.  Sure.  That's an inappropriate question.  Because people are saying.  That's an inappropriate question to ask.  Oh, all right.  I don't know what people would say that, but that's totally out of line.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm glad you asked to clear that up, but that's out of line.  For the record.  I'm trying to think of more stock terms.  Yeah.  There's a cat one.  What's the cat bounce one?  The dead cat bounce.  I mean, I see where you're going with it, but again, it's out of line. 
[02:46:30]  I'm just thinking dead cat bounce.  I'm just thinking.  That's all.  You think Vince was making Owen jokes in the office?  God damn it.  Yeah.  It felt like Owen.  Yeah.  Do you think people made money putting some put skis on it?  Ah, there you go.  Some put skis.  Always got to sneak in a line.  I love the Polish hammer.  Some put skis.  I got one.  You got one?  Okay. 
[02:47:00]  Hopefully the company will be on the dusty roads to recovery.  Whoa.  I like that.  That's good.  That's a good one.  I kind of like that one.  Clever.  Without being crass.  That's your motto, right?  That's your t-shirt.  Who else do we got?  I hope everybody is Coco beware of this investment.  That's pretty good.  Thank you.  It wasn't pretty good.  It's pretty good. 
[02:47:30]  That was good compared to the 9-11 museum.  This stock is shakier than the earthquake.  Oh.  That's.  No.  No?  No?  Can we work whoop-ass in there somehow?  Oh.  I guess somebody opened a can of whoop-ass all over this stock.  Dude, do you got the Mark Cuban thing?  These guys, the stupid sharks, bombed horribly on the billboards.  Oh, good.  Good.  Horribly.  They're playing on Fox right now in the middle.  Can you find that? 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Oh, boy, do they bomb.  Oh, how about this one?  Yeah.  Dude, love this stock.  See?  Yeah.  This stock is a bad investment for all mankind.  Oh.  Pretty good, huh?  Not bad.  Yeah, I'll get one.  You will?  You have to be a fucking Hulkamaniac to buy this shit.  It's just.  Doesn't make any sense.  Plows through something and does not fit the criteria. 
[02:48:30]  It used to be hot, but now this stock has gone stone cold.  Oh, shit.  There you go.  Oh, man, that's a good one.  Let's say hi to Kyle in North Carolina.  Kyle.  Hi, Kyle.  What's up, guys?  Huh?  I want to see if we can get a take on Boardroom Jimmy on the WWE stock.  I don't know if Boardroom Jimmy's around these days.  Boardroom Jimmy I did twice.  That was only twice?  Well, four times. 
[02:49:00]  It's shit, cunt, K-Rock.  Yes.  Awful, fucking, dump K-Rock.  And I don't think I've done that before or since.  No, huh?  It was a whole.  No, it became, Boardroom Jimmy kind of became Ted Sheckler.  Yeah, but Boardroom Jimmy was pretty damn funny.  I thought you did more than four times.  No, not many.  Maybe I did, but it was very few.  But thank you, sir.  Boardroom Jimmy would tell you this stock needs an undertaker.  Ah!  Nice.  That's a good one.  Or a Paul Bearer.  Oh, wait.  Mike in New York. 
[02:49:30]  Mike?  Hey, the WWE stock right now is a Brahma bull market.  Oh, my God.  This is so bad.  I love it.  It's so bad.  I love it.  Let's go to Jordan in Oyster Bay.  Oh, I got one when he's done.  Okay, Jordan.  Jeff?  Yeah?  Do you think Vince was shock mastered about the news?  The shock.  That's terrible.  What?  That's bad.  I got one.  Okay.  If you bought this stock, you better, Jimmy, superfly your ass out of there. 
[02:50:00]  Let's move on to the billboards.  Yeah, that was bad.  The billboard awards.  Yikes.  It's pleasing.  You had the cocky shark guys.  Although, I like Mark Cuban.  What about Mr. Wonderful?  You had Mr. Wonderful on the post show.  He's an asshole.  Period.  He's an asshole.  Okay?  I don't give a fuck.  He sold his company.  He was a dick.  I remember listening to that.  He's a dick.  Yeah, he was.  I don't give a fuck.  He made a billion dollars off some kind of software development deal or something. 
[02:50:30]  He's a dick.  Yeah.  He really is.  Mark Cuban and, what's his name?  Mr. Wonderful?  Mr. Wonderful.  He even calls himself Mr. Wonderful.  Why is he Mr. Wonderful?  Because he makes wonderful deals, I guess.  I don't know.  Whatever happened to Mr. Wonderful from WWF?  He's still alive, but he's got a giant handlebar mustache and one of his arms is a lot bigger  than the other.  What?  Okay.  Yeah.  Why is one of his arms bigger than the other?  It was one of his arms, like, atrophied or something. 
[02:51:00]  Can you show me a picture of this?  He really hides it well, but I think...  Oh, like Radar O'Reilly?  Wait, I forgot who Mr. Wonderful was.  Paul Orndorff.  Oh, right.  Remember, he used to come out Mr. Wonderful.  Right, okay.  And he was just giant.  Yeah.  Oh, this guy.  Right, right, right.  Here you go.  You can kind of see it in this photo.  You see how this arm has muscle, and then this one just hangs to the side.  Oh, it's kind of hanging, man.  Yeah.  Okay, yeah.  You see this?  Blowing it up, I can't help you.  You've got to make it bigger.  It's going to be a pixelated app in there.  Mr. Wonderful.  Uh-oh. 
[02:51:30]  You lost the picture.  Here it is.  What's wrong with his arm, did they say?  Like, you see how this is all right, and the other one is not so wonderful anymore.  Right.  Does he have an injury and he can't lift anymore?  No, it's like atrophied.  Why is it atrophied?  I don't know.  I don't know how he got to the size that he was, and I don't know.  Oh, we all know how, Sam.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's some steroid problems.  Let's say hi to Abraham in Arizona.  Abraham.  Yeah, don't get Jimmy the Superfly Snooker on this stock.  Fuck yeah. 
[02:52:00]  Let's say hi to Greg in Philly.  Greg?  Vince McMahon must feel like the honky-tonk man after Friday.  I don't get it.  I will tell you this.  It might be over.  Brett in Illinois.  Yeah, anybody who buys this stock's got to be off their rockers.  I like that one.  All right.  I don't swear.  All right, we're back in.  We're back in.  Vince is starting to feel the Harlem heat.  Oh!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  This stock is far from sensational sherry.  Oof.  Yeah, how about this?  Uh-huh.  This fucking stock's got me in a figure-four leg lock.  It's great stuff.  It's not really good.  It's good.  Moolah.  Moolah.  The amazing Moolah.  Oh, he's losing all-  Vince lost a lot of Moolah.  A lot of Moolah.  Vince lost all of his fabulous Moolah.  Bill in Texas.  Bill.  Hey, Jimmy, I've got one for you.  Sure.  Hey, watch out. 
[02:53:00]  Don't go for that stock.  It's just Snooker.  Your phone is...  I heard Snooker.  You've been Snooker.  You've been Snooker.  You can have your listens, Tom.  All right.  We're going to find out.  I need to find out about Mr. Wonderful's hurt arm.  This guy knows.  Chris in Indiana.  Call screen today?  Yeah, the call screening is horrible today.  Horrible.  Who put that phone call on?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Who's doing it?  Who's doing it today?  Our intern, Adrian.  Oh.  Oh, wait.  Tell her to do it right. 
[02:53:30]  He's the boy.  She hasn't been the same since she fell in that feed bag in the pet store.  Go ahead, Chris.  Yeah, back in the day, Orndorff had a big feud with Hogan, and he injured his arm like  the first two weeks into it, and they were making so much money.  Instead of taking time off and letting it heal, it continued to work for like the next three  months, making a mad amount of money, and that's why his arms all screwed up to this  day.  No kidding.  He had to headline WrestleMania 1.  Oh, wow.  That was the Hogan feud.  That was WrestleMania 1.  Yeah. 
[02:54:00]  What's his name?  Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff.  Was he popular at one point?  Yeah.  He was the biggest bad guy in the company.  It was Piper.  What year did he get out?  Well, I mean, he was still wrestling deep into the 90s, but...  Jesus.  He should.  I mean, he was big in like 85.  All right.  Can we see the sharks on the Billboard musicals last night?  Was it good, funny?  Not good.  Mark Cuban and...  And Mr. Wonderful.  And Mr. Wonderful.  Kevin O'Leary.  That's his name, right?  I don't know.  He's just a dick.  I call him dick. 
[02:54:30]  What?  No, Travis just said it is, because Travis and me watched Shark Tank religiously.  Oh.  I kind of like Shark Tank.  It's the best show on TV.  I kind of like it.  I was the one over the weekend I was amazed by.  Fuck.  You see DDP Yoga on Shark Tank?  No, I did not.  He's had his foot in his hand.  I guess I haven't seen all of them.  I don't watch that at all.  I watched that shit on demand.  There you are.  On demand.  Loops of it.  Oh, the lady that came up with the boxes.  What was that one?  I missed that one.  They just fold open.  Yeah, they were collapsible boxes. 
[02:55:00]  But they fold open.  You don't have to put the folds in and all that shit.  The flaps and the folds and shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I watched a couple weeks ago a guy had a collapsible kayak.  Well, that was the shit.  Yeah, it was awesome, right?  I saw that, yeah.  But they wouldn't invest with him, because the production was too much of a cost factor.  I'll be a customer, but not an investor.  That's right.  They're just dicks.  There's that one woman with the short hair that doesn't have a dime to her name.  I'm convinced of it.  She never invests in anything.  She never...  Barbara Corcoran?  Barbara Corcoran doesn't have a dime to her name.  She's a real estate mogul.  She is not. 
[02:55:30]  She sold one apartment.  She doesn't invest in anything, really?  No, she never buys anything.  That's hilarious.  She doesn't have a dime.  Are these guys really stuck with these people?  Yeah.  You see the thing.  It says these Shark Tank guys are investing their own money in these companies.  The guy from FUBU buys stuff.  That nice Canadian guy who likes race cars buys stuff.  Barbara Corcoran doesn't spend a dime.  So why can't we just be part of the Shark Tank?  You don't have that kind of money.  Oh, all right.  Well, back.  Some of these guys.  Like, you've got to hang out with me and Travis, because then you guys are, like, really rich. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  But when you hang out with the Shark Tank guys, you guys are the Sam and Travis's.  Oh, man.  That's a great point.  Never want to be them.  All right.  Let's do this.  So you have the dick and our old friend Mark Cuban on the Billboard Music Awards last night.  I wonder what's the dick.  He is the dick.  We should get him on our show.  Why?  So you can let him know?  We'll handle him differently than you did.  I thought he was great.  The only reason he was on Sam's show is because we said, fuck him.  I think so.  I think you're right.  Why did you say, fuck him? 
[02:56:30]  Because he's a dick.  All right, go ahead.  This is their banter last night.  This was horrendous.  We're here to announce our latest investments.  We've just spent $3.2 billion to buy a hot new company called Beatdowns by Solange.  That was a great, great elevator pitch.  You know, country music is a growth industry, too.  But getting a number one hit is really hard. 
[02:57:00]  Are they booing?  It was almost impossible.  But here's a country band that has done just that.  Cuban knows it, Bob.  Cuban's not dumb when it comes to this shit.  Bob.  Mr. Wonderful couldn't have had worse timing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then he just comes in.  That's a great elevator pitch.  What?  Trampling over the audience reaction.  Nobody's paying attention to him.  What did you think of that?  Beatdowns by Solange.  It wasn't the best joke, but it made me dislike the audience for being objecting to it. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, you didn't like the audience thing.  I didn't think it bombed completely.  It got like a little reaction.  Yeah, but then listen to...  I don't think Cuban bombed completely.  The delivery was horrible.  Oh, yeah.  But I think there's no doubt about it.  Your guy's Mr. Wonderful.  He was a huge bomb.  That line stunk.  Because he thinks everybody there watches their show.  Oh, yeah.  And he doesn't realize that everybody's reacting to the thing Cuban said, so no, he's paying  attention to what he's saying anyway.  He was trying to get his line.  It was time for him to talk. 
[02:58:00]  Mr. Wonderful.  Mr. Wonderful.  What a dick.  Had to get his shit in.  We're here to announce our latest investments.  Look at Cuban trying to sell it.  He spent $3.2 billion to buy a hot new company called Beatdowns by Solange.  That was a great, great elevator pitch.  You know, country music.  Country music.  That was a great elevator pitch. 
[02:58:30]  Great elevator pitch.  Yikes.  Did we do Coco Beware of that stock?  I said that one.  I did.  No, I did.  Yeah, all right.  You guys made fun of me for it.  Is there a Wendy Richter in the WWE?  Yeah.  The stock fell so hard it registered on the Wendy Richter scale.  I like that.  All right, okay.  Can you smell the stock the rock is pushing?  I don't know.  Pete in Indiana.  I got one.  Everybody get ready to fucking crack up. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  This stock lost so much money, they should buy it in China.  Oh, China.  Somebody took an axe of demolition to this stock.  Oh.  Crash.  Vince is going to have to pack his bags and move to a cheaper neighborhood.  But...  X-Pack?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That wasn't...  X-Pack is the guy. 
[02:59:30]  X-Pack is the rapper.  X-Pack is the rapper.  X-Pack is the rapper.  Close enough.  To have to X-Pack his bags.  X-Pack.  Yeah, X-Pack stunk.  I know.  This stock is really D-Generation X-ing.  It was just terrible.  That was the bit.  Yeah.  I think we sort of did this one, too.  But Ryan in Jersey.  Ryan.  Yo.  Hey.  After this stock, Vince McMahon's going to be just a million-dollar man.  True. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, right.  Right.  You know, I was bugging...  How could we work Virgil into this?  Oh, that's tough.  Sitting at his dumb table.  Vince McMahon still has way more money than Virgil.  Yes.  That's true.  The stock Virgil'd.  That's pretty funny.  The stock Virgil'd just fell alone.  Poor Virgil.  That other woman bugs me on Shark Tank, too.  Who's that?  With the longer hair?  Yeah.  Laurie Grenier.  She's like, what, a home shopping lady or something, right?  All she's got is QVC. 
[03:00:30]  QVC.  Every product that comes in and pitches her stuff, and she's like, I can take you to QVC.  Right.  Every product that comes in, I can take you to QVC.  I can't stand that show.  Will they just stand there and judge people's ideas?  No, I'm not giving you money.  Fuck you.  And Mr. Wonderful always has this look on his face, like, you're quite a piece of shit.  Yeah.  I'm so much better than you.  I've seen...  I saw one just, like, recently.  I don't even know why it was on, but it was the little effeminate black kid with the bow ties. 
[03:01:00]  That no one would give money to.  What was it?  Good.  He made little bow ties.  But we already have bow ties.  I know.  Who makes his bow ties special?  Because he hand makes them or something.  His grandma bought him a sewing machine.  It was great.  How much is he going to make?  Eight a year?  I know.  It's just it.  He's not making a lot of bow ties.  And that was it.  It's like, oh, they're going to mass produce them.  But then it takes away from the kind of little...  He's like the Cronut guy of bow ties.  He is.  Does he have a patent on these bow ties? 
[03:01:30]  I don't know.  Can we sell them to somebody else?  No.  That's what they were talking about.  Speaking of patent, he's outside our studio.  Pat Oswald.  Oh, there you go.  So we should take a break here.  Wordplay Yuma.  And we're going to play the Spaz thing, right?  The giant mosquito?  A giant mosquito.  For the newer listeners, Spaz did some great stuff for our show back in the day.  And this is not a character.  This was him.  I'm telling you.  So we'll play this and we'll get Pat Oswald on the show next.  All right.  Let's move on with the giant mosquito, I believe, is next.  Anyway, what else is going on in Queens? 
[03:02:00]  It seems to be like, instead of the flu bug, we've got a mosquito going around killing people.  Whoa.  There he is.  A giant mosquito seen crossing the Triborough Bridge.  Whoa.  Giant mosquito.  You're convinced that's one mosquito and they're trying to find this one mosquito.  No, what I meant was there's a bunch of mosquitoes under one breed.  So it's a giant mosquito breed.  What?  The giant mosquito in Queens killing people. 
[03:02:30]  Anyway, what else is going on in Queens?  It seems to be like, instead of the flu bug, we've got a mosquito going around killing people.  Apparently it affects your immune system and your brain.  It inflates.  It's called.  I can't even pronounce this.  Here it goes.  Encephalito.  Anyways.  Encephalito.  Look at how hard it's at. 
[03:03:00]  Encephalito.  I don't know.  Encephalito.  It's Homer Simpson, everyone.  Did you figure out how to say that word?  I couldn't pronounce it.  Try again.  I need the word in front of me to pronounce it.  All right.  Someone give him the word.  I'm sure it's in the newspaper.  Dude, I was laughing so hard I just started dry heaving.  Giant Mosquito.  Are you?  Yeah.  Giant Mosquito.  Look for the giant mosquito story.  Rick eagerly looking for the giant mosquito story. 
[03:03:30]  I can't even pronounce this.  Encephalito.  Anyway, it's a mosquito.  All right.  I got it.  All right.  You got the word in front of him.  All right.  Go ahead.  Spaz has the word in front of him.  Third death feared from...  Encephalitis.  That's my sister's name.  Encephalitis.  You get your ass over here.  Your sister's spatula and the boris inside.  Encephalitis. 
[03:04:00]  Encephalitis.  All right.  Let's get back into the giant mosquito story.  And it inflames the outer layer of your brain.  Is that what happened?  The mosquito is carrying.  In severe cases, these are some of the symptoms you may get.  Severe headaches, muscle aches, high fever, stiff neck, disorientation.  Then you go into a coma, have a couple of tremors, a convulsion or two.  Then you're in paralysis and then could die.  Coincidentally enough, the same thing that happens when listening to Kate talk. 
[03:04:30]  You sure you didn't get bit by this mosquito?  I'm crying.  I'm laughing so hard.  All right.  Let's get back to the tape.  These are the symptoms that people infected have been showing.  And so all throughout yesterday, residents of Queens were being sprayed with bug spray.  Residents are being sprayed.  The residents are being sprayed.  What?  Wait.  No, they're spraying like sumps and stagnant pools of water and brush. 
[03:05:00]  Not the people.  Damn you.  It's a mad house.  So you think they're just running around with this spraying people as they're going about  their business?  Super soakers full of DDT.  No.  There were tables set up with officers in that outbreak suit.  And they had to cut her in and off. 
[03:05:30]  They were just spraying people as they walked by the table.  That's the picture I saw.  Oh, my God.  If I just cracked his head open right now, would I be charged with anything?  Or would it be a public service?  All right.  And so all throughout yesterday, residents of Queens were being sprayed with bug spray.  Actually, there are ways to prevent yourself from getting hit with this mosquito in Queens. 
[03:06:00]  Hit with this mosquito?  There he tried to say, what's the word?  Encephalitis.  It's like you're from another country.  You know?  I'm going to pee myself.  I swear to God.  Encephalitis.  Where's Bactine?  Where's your sister Bactine?  It's still a giant mosquito at this point, Ant.  Yes.  One large, giant mosquito.  Thank God they're spraying the residents of Queens. 
[03:06:30]  They're just walking around with bug spray.  Spraying the residents.  In Queens.  Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants.  Socks went outdoors.  Use insect repellent.  That includes DEET.  D-E-E-T.  Avoid the outdoor activity from dusk to the door.  Remove water from cars and jars, because that's where mosquitoes later eggs and, you know,  settled water.  And check your home for tight-fitting screens indoors.  Much like the rules of going out during the summer. 
[03:07:00]  You know, don't wear heavy clothing.  Don't run in 100-degree heat.  This is common sense, people.  Follow it.  Wait a minute.  You're telling people to follow common sense.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do-do-do.  I am stupefied, man.  What?  It's common sense, people. 
[03:07:30]  Follow it.  Yes.  All right.  Let's move on here.  People should know these things anyway, but of course, we got morons on the TV.  And like me on the radio right now.  That's true.  Telling you all the preventing causes to do.  So, anyway, we're going to get right back to music, and we're going to kick it off.  Actually, it would have been a Ren Stramstein with Duhast.  Yeah.  Anyway, we got some more news along the way.  We're going to talk sports after this next song break. 
[03:08:00]  There's Duhast.  We are WICR.  We'll be great.  New ground.  That was good.  I hit the note.  You know, I hit the post.  Ah.  That's what I said.  We're from Encephalitis.  Don't you like that?  Encephalitis.  People saying, stop.  I can't see.  I'm laughing so hard.  Please, please stop.  The gentlemen are off to drop a deuce.

[03:17:00]  It's a nice surprise.  Some people, we'd be like, oh, this is going to be a problem.  Well, that's how this started.  Sam goes, you know, we got a guest today.  And I looked at my sheet, I go, no guest today.  And we all start rolling our eyes, like, oh, fuck, who is it going to be?  Some cooking show guy.  Who the fuck is it going to be?  And then Sam had to cut us off at the pass and said, no, you're going to like this.  And we're like, are you sure?  And write the name down.  And then he wrote your name and we were pleasantly.  Yeah, fold it up on a piece of paper. 
[03:17:30]  Let me open it.  Right.  We were happy.  We were happy.  Slow reveal.  We were very happy to hear you're in town.  I was happy that you guys let me come in.  You got a little heat recently with your apology tweets.  People were loving those.  Oh, yeah.  No blowback from that at all.  Was salon reasonable, at least?  Oh, yeah.  Very measured and smart about, again, yeah, they are my, it's not even salon. 
[03:18:00]  It's just this overall, how can I put this?  Okay, you know how people make fun of the Tea Party for having this litmus test where  they will, the Republicans have kind of partially fucked themselves because there are these, there's  this crazy sliver of the Tea Party that if you go even slightly off, we will vote you out.  Well, the same thing is happening.  Again, I think the bulk of social justice warriors, I think they have the right idea for the most 
[03:18:30]  part, but then there's that vocal sliver that wants a litmus test on everything, and  if you deviate even a little bit, it's, you're out and we have to destroy you.  From the litmus test they've created and they've set the boundaries on it.  Yeah, exactly.  It makes no, again, like, I got all this, there's a guy named, a writer named Steve Saylor  who I completely disagree with on everything, like, I cannot, but he's also a really good 
[03:19:00]  writer, so I read him because it's opinions I don't agree with that I, I want to test what  I believe in all the time.  Sure.  I read people I don't agree with, so, and he said something in one of his essays about  political correctness is a war on noticing, and I was like, ah, shit, I kind of can't disagree  with, like, I, that makes a lot of sense, that sentence, so I tweeted that out and everyone  suddenly, you're a white supremacist, just like this Steve Saylor guy, you just quoted  him.  No, I'm quoting, if a guy who I totally don't agree with says something that actually kind 
[03:19:30]  of nails me, then I need to answer to that, or at least be aware of it.  Right, but.  Does that make sense?  But that's not part of the rule book.  No.  The rule book says you have to shun everything that someone says, no matter what he says.  Based on something, right, right, if somebody says something that offends you, then everything  he said should offend you.  Get a new rule book.  Right.  Yes, get a new rule book.  The rule book.  Throw it out.  That's one of the reasons I love doing stand-up in Washington, D.C. when I do the improv, because 
[03:20:00]  the audience are very, very conservative, and a lot of them work in government, and that's  one of the few conservative audiences that will go, oh, I don't agree with that, but that  was fucking good.  Fucking funny.  I got it.  You know what?  Good point.  Yeah.  So, as long as you're not personally wrapped up in this shit, and can look at it objectively  and go, okay, well, I don't agree with that, but hey, I'm happy when someone I disagree  with makes an excellent point, because it means I have to up my game. 
[03:20:30]  Like, if I just walk through life going, well, everyone who disagrees with me, we all know  they're idiots anyway.  Right.  So then it just makes you soft and lazy, and you don't need to be present.  See, maybe I'm wrong.  I look at them like they're aunts who should be killed.  I'm stepped on.  Yeah.  Yeah, so I just said, okay, I'll just do these, I will apologize for tweets I never  made.  Oh, it's fucking great.  And of course, people heard things in their head and gotten...  That's what it is, because one of the examples I saw was so fucking funny. 
[03:21:00]  It's like, well, I deleted that last tweet, because people were, you know, offended by  it, and I do believe that there were a lot of heroes that...  It was vague.  Yeah, it was very vague.  Again, I was saying, sorry about the last tweet, already deleted, you know, the people  who went through the Holocaust deserve our respect, not penis limericks.  Right, right.  And so in people's head, they all started like, what the hell did you see, you know,  and so... 
[03:21:30]  Not penis limericks.  Yeah.  And it was, I keyed it off of, you know, when you guys were going over the, when you  did that apology clock, like, how long can we go?  And then also, it was off of that, and also a comedian named Natasha Leggero, who...  At a line, she was.  Oh, boy.  Who made a joke about the Spaghetti, when SpaghettiOs tried to do that tweet.  Right.  For, it was, was it Pearl Harbor Day they did?  Was it Pearl Harbor Day, yes. 
[03:22:00]  And it was, like, it was a little SpaghettiO holding a fucking flag.  Holding a flag.  And then, so later, she made a reference, and, and saying, you know, it's, it's terrible  that, that they should do that for World War veterans, and, and it's even worse that  they should make them offended by SpaghettiOs, because that's one of the few things they  can enjoy.  They can eat, yeah, yeah.  Not, and people, she has to apologize to our brave, and she said, these motherfuckers  face down the Nazi horde, and my SpaghettiOs, isn't that more insulting to them, to say 
[03:22:30]  that they would be offended, but, and by the way, that is becoming my new, I'm starting  to collect, um, I love moments when people step in for another group, and demand an apology  on their behalf, and then the other group says, no, we're, hey, fuck you, we're fine, we're  not a bunch of little babies.  Like, I love when they, again, the white knight shit, and, but I love when white knights get  called out.  Love it, yes. 
[03:23:00]  And they just go, no, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  Thanks.  I thought that was funny.  Yeah.  You're an idiot.  I remember I was, um, when I was in college, uh, one of my, uh, friends, uh, in college  was gay, and, and I was, uh...  You didn't know, did you?  Uh, well, I mean, besides the, you know, constant Bronski boy in a loop, no.  Um, so, so we're, but, so again, I was trying to be like, hey, I'm down with you, like, I  understand the oppression you guys are going through, and I was saying, hey, I watched that, 
[03:23:30]  um, in Living Color last night, and those, the two gay movie critics, I mean, that's  just offensive.  Oh, shit.  And that was, like, I'm telling him, like, and, like, and he was, and he just goes, what  the fuck are you talking about?  That's hilarious.  And, um, in the gay community, we make fun of gay people like that.  Like, that's the thing that we make fun of, because don't get offended on my behalf.  You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  You were all wound up, right?  Yep, you're right.  I was, I was wound up, I was genuinely, half genuinely wound up, and half like, I'm going to 
[03:24:00]  impress this guy, and show him how progressive and concerned I am.  How open-minded I am.  You need to fucking, no, you don't know what you're talking about.  Shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  And it was just a great douche chill moment.  So, I just, so, ever since then, like, I've, I love when the white knights get called out  by the people they're protecting, like, leave them alone.  You'll fucking leave me alone.  I don't need your help.  Fine.  Take a hike.  Yeah.  So, I love that shit.  The apology thing is just out of hand.  Yeah.  I'm apologizing for others, like, the, the NBC one drove us nuts when Joan Rivers was 
[03:24:30]  on, and she was being hilarious, and then, the next day, NBC apologized on behalf of Joan  Rivers, like, what the fuck did she say?  And she's like, I'm not going to fucking apologize for anything.  Yeah, what was the joke?  Cleveland, she said something about her apartment being, uh, yeah, go ahead, Jim, sorry.  It was something about her apartment being smaller than the place that the Cleveland girls  had to stay in for 10 years.  Fine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some reference to that.  And it's like, those girls suffered unimaginable.  By the way, that, here's what I also hate about that, is NBC had Joan Rivers on, and did 
[03:25:00]  the, I mean, what's she going to say, right?  Right, right, right, right, right, right, trying to get the ratings for it, and then when she  actually does what they said, she's going to do, we're so sorry.  I don't know what happened there.  You booked Joan Rivers, you idiot, and you wanted her to go that far.  And they throw her under the bus by saying her supposed joke, they don't even want to  acknowledge that it was a joke.  That's the other thing that drives me crazy, when someone is offended by something, a joke, 
[03:25:30]  and it's not enough for them to go, well, I think that's in bed.  They have to go, and nobody was laughing.  Right, right.  Well, let me, I'd like to see a tape of that club set, because I would bet people were dying  and you were upset.  Or when they write about it, and they put quotes around the word joke, it's like, you  don't need to question that it was a joke.  We all know it was a joke, but you questioning whether it was a joke by putting quotes around  it doesn't make it any less of a joke.  Yeah, because then you're assuming, what, that she was trying to hurt people, like really 
[03:26:00]  be serious and hurt someone?  If it wasn't a joke, then she's really a fucking asshole.  Yeah, yeah.  But it was a joke.  And everyone knows that.  Right.  Yeah, she's Joan Rivers.  That's got to drive you guys nuts when they put the quotes around joke.  That's got to be bothersome.  It also drives me crazy when somebody writes either in some essay or some Tumblr post about  a joke that you've made, and they're calling you out for not being funny, and they themselves  are the unfunniest.  Yes.  And they're also, when they're, again, I don't mind being called out by, there's been a couple 
[03:26:30]  of Tumblr posts I've retweeted, because the writing is fucking good.  What I hate is when someone calls you out, and they're just a terrible, they're boring,  and you can tell they're a boring human being, and they don't understand, like, they've wanted  to be funny their whole lives, and they don't know why.  Yeah, parties all talk, and people will just start walking away from me.  Walk away, yeah.  You know, human beings are horrible.  They don't, you know, and then they're angry at comedians for what is going on over there.  These long-winded paragraph after paragraph of nothing, of boredom. 
[03:27:00]  But they're getting an audience, though.  People are fucking reading their shit.  Well, they're getting an audience if me or someone else retweets it.  All right, gotcha.  Yep.  You give them some heat, then you realize.  The other thing, too, is when I was doing the apology thing, and some people were, most  people were not, and there was the small vocal group who started saying, you know, oh, you're  only retweeting people who like what you're doing.  You're a fucking coward.  You won't retweet my criticism.  Then I would retweet their criticism, and they would go, your followers are attacking 
[03:27:30]  me, you fucking coward.  It's just like, well, there's no way I can.  Oh, you get your fucking guys after me.  Well, when you put the period before what they, when you retweet or before you respond  to them, I'm like, why are you going to put your, your, your, uh, period before you want  your help from your minions?  And it's like, hey, cunt, don't fucking talk to me in a public forum and expect a private  discussion.  You're not roping me into an elevator ride.  Who are you?  Fuck you.  Too bad. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But again, I literally, from the same people, I got, you won't retweet my criticism.  You're a coward.  I retweet them.  Your followers attack me.  You are a coward.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, I can't.  Are you saying you can't win on Twitter?  Wow.  It's weird how I realized that last week.  Last week.  There was, you remember that show Fernwood Tonight?  Oh, yeah.  No.  On their very first episode, Martin Mull and, uh, and Fred Willard is one of the funniest  fucking shows.  It's hilarious.  It's this fake talk show. 
[03:28:30]  They did it in the seventies.  It was a spinoff from Mary Hartman.  Yes, it was.  Yeah.  Is that really the seventies?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It was a spinoff.  And, uh, Norman Lear and just brilliant.  So they, on their very first episode, and it's set in Fernwood, Ohio, this little town  that's a local, like, you know, hello, Fernwood.  So their first guest, it's called, uh, meet, it's like meet a Jew.  And what the premise is, this, a Jewish guy was speeding through Fernwood.  So they, they were going to give him a ticket and they go, Hey, if you, if you don't want  to pay the ticket, if you'll come on this show so the town of Fernwood can see a Jew, 
[03:29:00]  you don't have to pay the ticket.  And he clearly just went, yeah, fine.  So he comes out and, and Fred Willard and Martin Moe are so genius at being the, trying  to be the open liberal guys that are just saying the most offensive stuff.  So they're just like, so what is, um, what's Barbara Streisand up to?  Like what's she doing?  And he goes, well, I don't know what her next project is.  I, I've always enjoyed her.  And then Fred Willard goes, you guys must be so proud of her.  So then they got all these letters from the ACLU and the League of Catholic Bishops. 
[03:29:30]  Like that was the most offensive, racist, there's just horrible, you know, kicking  down and blah, blah, blah.  Then they get a letter from the Anti-Defamation League going, we loved that.  Wow.  That was the funniest shit you've ever seen.  So they just forwarded the letter to all the other groups that were offended.  Now, yeah, cause you could, that could shut them right up.  Yeah, exactly.  It should shut them right up.  Yeah.  The people, again, it's the white knight shit.  Yeah, yeah.  I just, that, I love that.  Coming to the rescue.  I gotta fucking find some of those shows cause they were. 
[03:30:00]  How long was it on?  They were really funny.  It was on for a couple of years.  A few years back in the 70s.  I mean, it was on nightly and they would riff the whole show.  I mean, they had a basic outline, but guests would come on and Martin Mullin, Fred Willard,  you can watch some segments on, on YouTube.  I don't know why that like Criterion or something one hasn't put out every single episode.  Yeah, yeah.  Amazing.  And then, who was that, uh, DeVall, Frank DeVall?  Uh, uh, hang on.  What was it, Fred?  Some, Happy, Happy Kind and the Mirth Makers. 
[03:30:30]  Happy Kind and the Mirth Makers was his band.  And this guy, Happy Kind, looks like, he looked like the most suicidal man in his giant headphones.  And he was the actual, the, um, a music guy for many years for television shows.  Like, everything you ever hear on, like, the Brady Bunch?  Yeah.  And, uh...  That's that guy.  That's that guy.  And he wrote all that music.  And that's the guy they got to be the, the band for the, uh, show.  And they have people coming on.  You want to see a clip, don't you?  Yeah, oh, just see some of them. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, we gotta get someone in here to show a clip.  He'll come back in.  There's a great clip where a guy comes on and he's talking about, he's trying to get rid of all of the racist, um, stuff from the 20s and 30s.  Where they would have, like, you know, black people caricatures.  And, you know, this is just really bad.  And, you know, I'm just trying to get rid of it.  And then Fred Willard's like, I know.  I mean, except, I mean, the guys with the big eyes.  Those were funny.  Like, he's trying to keep, like, one thing that he likes.  And, again, being so, like, again, I totally agree with you.  But they would agree with him in a way that was so offensive and close. 
[03:31:30]  Yes, yeah, yeah.  Which clip should we try to find?  Fernwood Tonight.  Fernwood Tonight.  Um, there might even be the first episode.  I don't know.  Yeah, god damn.  What a strange little show.  Yeah.  And it's now, like, I went to a thing at the DGA where they had a reunion.  And people were saying, would you ever bring that back?  And Martin Muller's like, how do we out-parody stuff that's on now?  What's really out there?  How do we top it?  Like, back then, we could seem crazy. 
[03:32:00]  Now it would just seem normal.  Yeah.  Put Jew in there.  Yeah.  Put Jew in there.  There you go.  Martin Muller was like the host.  And Fred Willard was like his sidekick.  And just so cool.  Fred Willard is hilarious, man.  Yes.  Oh, fuck, is he funny.  Best in show when he's doing the announcements of the dog show.  It's just hilarious.  So, um, where's Dr. Bill up to the top there? 
[03:32:30]  Try that one.  I'll find these.  Sit down.  Thanks, Happy.  Our next guest is an eminent anthropologist and sociologist from Southern Ohio University,  right here in Southern Ohio.  Before you get the name.  Why waste time on a name?  That's what I say.  He's been doing some studies on the causes of racial prejudice.  And, uh, probably about the best in the field.  Please welcome Dr. Emanuel Kaczynski. 
[03:33:00]  Awful music.  It's terrible.  They play like this Jewish klezmer music to bring them out.  They talk about races.  How are you?  Welcome to the show.  Well, we're pretty lucky to have you here.  Uh, doctor, can you, uh, explain a little bit about your research?  Well, Barth, um, America, as we all know, is famous as a melting pot.  Uh, many diverse ethnic groups have been thrown together. 
[03:33:30]  Sure.  Uh, suddenly, and this leads to bigotry and name-calling.  Uh, the, uh, origins of, uh, various racial prejudices, uh, are what we are trying to, uh,  put an end to and stop stereotyping once and for all.  There's probably, uh, too much of that.  More than we even need.  That's up for grabs, I think.  So you studied various nationalities just to find out, um, you know, how people come,  become, uh, prejudiced against them. 
[03:34:00]  Is that it?  Exactly.  Uh, all, all races are alike.  Uh, we are all the same.  Does that, uh, does that apply, uh, like to the Dago also?  What I'm saying is, you know, to all, yes, I think.  All in trouble.  And, uh, well, let us start with the Italians, uh, the, um, after examining the bone structure  of, uh, the Italians and various other people, we find the only differences between their  bodies and the other races was in the, uh, knuckle and fist area. 
[03:34:30]  Uh, we found that the bones were developed broader and heavier and stronger, and, uh,  we found the musculature of the upper arm and shoulder, uh, was, uh, much bigger and,  uh, uh, much better developed.  Uh, the fists and arms of Italians are designed for hitting.  Uh, Italians enjoy hitting.  Yeah, is this, uh, is this the only feature that really separates Italians from, Italians 
[03:35:00]  from perfectly normal people?  Yes.  I'd say that in a, uh, in a definite tendency towards overweight, uh, their, um, weight problem  is probably, uh, a subconscious one, but it is harder to dispose of a body in a car trunk  or a barrel if it's fat.  Now, this is a, uh, recurring nightmare with many Italians, and, uh, it may explain all  the hitting.  Absolutely.  In other words, fists and a desire to hit, and the large stomach and large body, really 
[03:35:30]  large fists, large body would be the main, uh, definitely, uh, the only differences between,  uh, as I said before, normal people and Italians.  Yes, uh, and also their inability to learn English.  Uh, tests show that Italian tongues are, uh, tongues are, are thick at the back, you see,  and this causes a strain on the throat muscles and gives them a definite tendency to speak  in monosyllables and grunt a lot.  I'll be done. 
[03:36:00]  What did your, uh, study show about other groups?  Why zero in just on the, uh...  Well, uh, that's strange, you should ask, but, uh, we, uh, studied the electrocardiographs  of our Jewish friends and, uh, tried to learn about the, uh, Jewish aversion to alcoholic  beverages.  They don't drink a lot, do they?  No, Jewish people don't like to drink, uh, but we...  People are afraid they'll have to pick up a tab.  There's not that I think there'll be a type of tab.  Could be a type of tab.  Oh, that could be a type of tab, this is a very...  Wow, that is very funny. 
[03:36:30]  Or fresca.  No, I'm joking, because we...  There's nothing against tab.  Uh, well, nothing against tab.  We didn't have a new person on the show earlier, and I think we all came to know his type of  people a little better, and I think we're all a little richer for it, too.  So what did you find?  Well, all that strictly toward one side, we discovered that when Jewish people are drinking  and the glass is half empty, you see, the rim of the glass comes to rest against the bridge  of the nose, and the magnitude of the nose acts as an obstacle to drinking and as a deterrent. 
[03:37:00]  It's not so much they don't want to drink, they simply can't.  That's exactly right.  That's the most problem.  There's all the mental or any religious or moral.  Okay, okay, Doctor, but how about the Irish?  Now, they're known as really big drinkers.  Now, how would you explain that?  Well, the Irish, you see, they drink more because they have little tiny noses, and also  they are totally insensitive to embarrassment.  That's a little Irish nose. 
[03:37:30]  Why do they wear green so much, or does it just seem that way?  No, that's a very good question.  You see, the Irish are basically a bunch of bog-trotting potato farmers.  They see green grass, and they figure, why fight it?  Just the opposite of the Italians, of course, who would love to fight it.  At the drop of a pizza. 
[03:38:00]  That's great.  Very interesting.  What other peoples have you studied?  What have you found?  Well, the Chinese, you see.  Now, this is very fascinating, because you see, the skin of the Chinese, and particularly  in the area of the hands and the palms, is highly water-resistant, which gives Chinese  people a much higher tolerance for doing laundry.  Could you imagine trying to get this on today?  I understand that shortly after making that study, you have to go back and re-study again. 
[03:38:30]  The think pieces on this would be endless.  The internet would melt down if this was on the hands.  Now, wait a second.  What about Japs now?  Please, you are referring to the Japanese people.  We studied them.  We took a group of Japanese babies and put a bush in their playpen.  One by one, they began pruning the bush. 
[03:39:00]  And several of them actually began trying to hide behind it.  We also found that the Japanese enjoy the feel of leather and straps around their necks,  which explains why they enjoy wearing cameras and binoculars.  They're having little flight bags, of course, around the arm.  Absolutely.  You see that everywhere.  I'm kind of curious.  What about, let's say, well, I don't think we've touched on the Latin and Spanish people. 
[03:39:30]  We've had an influence with them later.  What do you think of them?  Well, you see, the Latin and the Spanish people exhibit a trait we call proximity desirability.  Now, this is the need to be near others of their own kind.  Now, we found that their houses are smaller, but their families are bigger, you see.  And this may account for greater numbers of Latin people who live in, say, the same basement  or ride all in the same old beat-up Chevy. 
[03:40:00]  Now, these are absolutely fascinating findings.  And I'm curious.  I'm sure it's been a long time.  How long have you been involved in these studies here?  Oh, almost six months.  Well, the last three months being the heavy part.  The first part was getting the office together, of course.  I guess the ultimate question I have to ask you, what nationality are you?  I am Polish. 
[03:40:30]  I don't need to tell you.  I'm sure it's not news that a lot of people have told Polish jokes, you know, and I could  tell you something right now, but I'd have to tell them kind of slowly, wouldn't I?  I don't understand that.  I read the paper every day, I try to get international papers, I saw where a large hole appeared in  Warsaw, and they said the police were looking into it. 
[03:41:00]  What did they find?  But, seriously, the Polish people have long been the brunt of some really cruel jokes, I  think, and I just wonder, what are your findings in that area?  Well, I have done a lot of studies on my people, and all of our research indicates that Polish  people tend to be bright, perceptive, and highly intelligent.  Well, Dr. Kaczynski, you certainly are a living testimony of your own people, and I 
[03:41:30]  wish we could meet a couple more people like you.  In fact, if we had three of you like you, we could change this light bulb.  Here's what you're coming by, and we'll be right back after this important work.  Oh, shit, that's great.  There we go.  Fernwood tonight.  Did they do blacks, too?  Yeah, I noticed that.  They didn't go with the blacks in that state.  I think because it's so obvious to go with the black thing that they just went with every  other one.  Every other, yeah, exactly.  But still, that would, again, that would be constant.  We'd never play today.  Should we laugh at this? 
[03:42:00]  Is this...  Right, oh my god, now this is...  Why can't we...  I would demand Martin Mull apologize for...  Who was the guy doing it?  That's just funny shit.  That guy...  Well, it was Norman Lear and...  No, the guy on the couch.  Oh, that guy.  I don't know.  He's a character actor that I've seen in a lot of stuff.  He had great timing.  Oh, just...  He was amazing.  Like, deadpan...  Their guests were always like that.  You never really knew who they were.  Yeah.  They were character actors. 
[03:42:30]  They'd sit there and just be funny.  The deadpan is great, you know.  Well, yeah, they had character actors, or they had actors that now are huge, but back  then...  Yeah, back then, weren't they?  So, like, Robin Williams would come on as different people, and Jim Varney, before he  was...  Wow.  Right.  ...Earnest came on as...  I see...  Yeah, what's his name there?  From Spinal Tap.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, so, yeah, Harry Shearer...  Harry Shearer.  All those guys kind of came on then, so you sort of saw the beginnings of that, but that  was, like, every night, half an hour, just...  I'm going to be in a Fernwood tonight, Luke. 
[03:43:00]  I know, now.  Yeah.  I thought you were going to have to watch some of them.  That's great.  I'm going to get stuck on YouTube today.  They did some crazy stuff.  Wow.  Very cool.  Patton, what are you doing in town, by the way?  You got the Webby Awards?  Yeah.  You're hosting that?  I'm hosting the Webby Awards again.  Nice.  It's awards for stuff on the internet.  Well.  Yeah.  Where's it happening?  That will be tonight at the...  Hang on.  Where...  Oh, it's Cipriani Wall Street.  Ah.  The Cipriani Wall Street, and it's...  You know, this is one of those things that started a few years ago. 
[03:43:30]  They gave awards to things on the internet, little films and viral stuff, and now it's  gotten...  I mean, the Academy Awards...  The first Academy Awards was just basically a dinner in a restaurant.  Right.  You know.  Now it's the 25th anniversary of the internet, of the Web.  Gee.  He's 25 years old this year.  Wow.  So the people that are coming are like...  I mean, Charlie Rose is coming, Fred Armisen, who's going to be doing his Ian Rubbish character,  Patty Smith, Natasha Lyonne, George Takei, and then Tim Berners-Lee, who basically invented 
[03:44:00]  the internet.  Oh.  He's the guy who invented it, and at the time could have patented it and said, no, this  needs to be free for everybody.  Whoops.  Why did he patent it?  I just...  I don't think...  He wanted it to be an open-sourced...  Anyone can share information.  Boy, I bet he regrets that.  He probably thought it would be a little thing that people play solitaire on.  He didn't see networking.  Yeah, exactly.  As he's booking his flight to New York, I bet you he's...  He's on orbit right now. 
[03:44:30]  Any cat videos on there?  You know what?  One of the memes of the year is something to do with a cat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure there's plenty...  Oh, come on.  Did you see my cat video over the weekend?  Little Beavis?  I didn't see it.  Go to O-P-A-N-T-X-M on YouTube.  You got a good cat video?  I got a good one.  Uh-oh.  This is a fucking good one.  And if you just hold out another 10 years, they will do an Irving Thalberg-style award  for you and your cat videos.  Go full screen. 
[03:45:00]  Sound up and watch this.  Do you get full penetration?  This is Little Beavis and Little Freddy.  Who's Little Freddy, by the way?  Oh, it's a friend's cat.  Watch.  Watch this now.  See?  Little Freddy hassling Beavis.  Now watch.  Oh!  Buddy!  Beavis!  Oh, he had it.  Beavis smacked his head on that fucking tail.  Wow.  That would hurt.  So hard.  And I love how after he cracked his skull, you see he walks over and Little... 
[03:45:30]  Freddy is still bugging him.  And he gives us a look like, no, we're done.  Yeah, yeah.  That hurt my head.  I just hit my head.  We're done.  That really hurt my head.  He spun around to chase him, crashed head first into the table leg.  And like a cat, you know, they just kind of try to play it off like nothing happened.  You got to change that title to Kitten Clocks His Head.  Yeah.  For the kitten people.  I know.  Because they don't know that your cat's...  Yeah, you know what?  You do have to put the event in the title now, like, to make people go, oh, I'll watch.  I'll watch that.  You can't just go, OMG, so cute. 
[03:46:00]  No.  No, no.  Give the event.  Let me know exactly what I'm going to see here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I will say that people like, sites like HuffPo and E. Baum's World, they're really,  they've learned the old style carnival barker.  You will not believe what Jennifer Lawrence does.  And then she just says something funny.  It's nothing.  Every video is now, check out this dog and child.  You won't believe how it ends.  And you're like, I just...  Like if a video of Christ returning appears. 
[03:46:30]  Yes.  And they go, oh, my God, the Savior returned.  And people go, I guess.  Let's see what else.  This was.  Because it'll be surrounded by, you know, this whale penis will make you rip your eyes out.  Right.  I don't want to see this.  Look at this Jew carrying heavy wood.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This crucifixion video is really intense.  You will not believe what happens three days later.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Before you can watch it, though, there's a 30-second commercial about E.D. 
[03:47:00]  Right.  First comment.  Yawn.  Yeah.  Fake.  Dislikes.  Right.  Yawn.  Dislikes.  Whatever.  We've got proof he lived.  He came back.  Eh.  It doesn't matter how amazing a video is.  People will always get dislikes.  Are there tickets still available for tonight?  Uh, I, I, I'm assuming there might be, but, I mean, it's pretty packed.  It's, it's.  All right.  So, you know, you don't even really have to promote it.  That's, that's just a good gig for you, man.  This is a great, are you kidding?  I, I, I, I'm, I'm bringing Patti Smith on stage. 
[03:47:30]  Wow.  I'm kind of shitting my pants about that.  That's a big deal for me.  Yeah, that's, uh, legendary right there.  I'm going to introduce Patti Smith.  That's, Jesus.  Smith or Smythe?  Uh, no.  Patti Smythe.  Sanguine scandal for God.  Opie.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I love Patti Smith.  Good man to you.  Right.  She was awesome.  Oh, Opie.  Married to John McEnroe.  John McEnroe now.  What?  Yes.  Oh, forever.  Amazing.  For a long time.  So, so he was, so you're saying he's shooting at the walls of heartache.  Bang, bang.  Yes, he does.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang. 
[03:48:00]  Somebody wrote that song and they had to fit in.  So we'll go shooting at the walls of heartache and we got two, we got two notes here.  What do we fill it with?  I don't have to say bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  Are you sure?  No, you're what?  I don't have to say bang, bang.  It's, what, yeah.  I don't think Patti's going to say bang, bang.  You, you might, she might surprise you.  She'll say it.  She just might.  She might surprise you.  She might, she might sing bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  Again, don't, you're popping your bees a little bit.  Just go, you know.  What a dumb thing to have to say.  Do you really like Patti Smith? 
[03:48:30]  Yes.  How deep do you go?  All the way back to horses.  Give us a song right now as we go to break.  Turn us on to a new Patti Smith song.  Not the tried and trues.  No, a new, oh God.  Not new, new, I'm meaning a song that would obviously be something we probably haven't heard.  Well, do, okay, do one of her, um, God, type in Patti Smith and then horses.  Like, I know Because the Night.  No, I know, which is what started as a Springsteen song.  Yeah.  He wrote that.  Very true.  Uh, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. 
[03:49:00]  Because the Night.  I wonder if Roland knows that.  Yeah, wait.  He probably does.  Oh, do Redondo Beach.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  We're going to go to break with this.  We're going to continue with Patton Oswald.  Patti Smith.  Yeah.  Redondo Beach.  Redondo Beach.  Wait a minute.  Isn't it?  What?  What the hell is this?  What's going on?  Oh, yeah.  What the hell is this?  Did Sammy pick something?  Late at noon, dream hotel, could you just had to quarrel? 
[03:49:30]  Sent you away.  Yeah.  I was looking for you, how you got it done?  Anthony Quinn?  This is a gorgeous sneer.  How old is this?  Uh, this was from the first album Horses.  Wow.  Yeah.  In the 80s?  Uh, 70s. 
[03:50:00]  Late 70s.  Yeah.  And her memoir, Just Kids, is incredible, about being young and broke in New York back  in the 70s.  It's amazing.  What were some of her issues back then?  Well, she was roommates with Robert Mapplethorpe, and she wanted to be, like, a poet, and he 
[03:50:30]  wanted to be a photographer, and they were so broke, and they were living in what was  now the fashionable Lower East Side.  And it was, they were just living in a wasteland, and they had to do a thing where, if she wanted  to get art supplies, and they also wanted to get food, they'd decide, do we go buy grilled  cheese sandwiches and shoplift the art supplies, or buy the art supplies and shoplift the, and  do a, a dine-and-dash.  They did, those were like, these two seminal artists were at a point where they're just  going, do we steal the food and buy the art supplies?  Do we steal the supplies and buy the food? 
[03:51:00]  Wow.  Like, that's where they both came out of, and it's just the, just these really human,  amazing moments.  I don't know if I've convinced you guys.  No, I, I like it.  I really do.  You must like, uh, Lucinda Williams.  Yes.  I love, I love her voice.  Love her.  Her voice is amazing.  God damn it.  Yeah.  All right, we'll let this play out.  More with Patton Oswald.  I'm looking for you, boo-boo.  How you gonna, God?  Pick up my cake, tellin' me fly, heardin' my room, started to cry, it was more than 
[03:51:30]  an angel, how you got him done.  Down by the ocean, it was so dismal, I was just standing with a shack on my face, yeah.  Hurts put away in the curl and you tied it with you. 
[03:52:00]  You'll never reach a girl, nina, my arms, think you were gone, gone.  Never reach a girl, nina, my arms, think you were gone, gone.  Gone, gone.  Gone, gone.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Oh, and A will be right back on Sirius XM.

This is a 20th anniversary O&A Radio Gem.  Yeah, this is going to be the showstopper today.  Everyone knows what TWATO is by now.  It's genital herpes, Anthony.  Yes.  Is it?  Yeah.  That's what we...  Diagnosed by three doctors, my friend.  Hold it. 
[03:57:00]  Mouth cancer was also diagnosed on a guy, and it turned out to be nothing.  Man, if this isn't a match made in heaven, look at these two.  He's cute.  Yeah, you like him?  Very cute.  You like him, Sandy?  Yes.  Are you well-endowed?  No.  You have a nice tongue, I bet.  Not too big, not too well-endowed.  We don't have to give Sandy the mic anymore because she doesn't say anything worth saying ever.  All right, look, we're running out of time.  Sandy, take those off.  I am literally a foot away.  Come on.  She painted TWATO today to match her yellow tights. 
[03:57:30]  It's yellow.  It's bright yellow.  All right, Paulo, if you would please get to know the lovely TWATO.  Here I go.  All right.  Okay, here we go.  All right, he's going in, Ant.

That is the most disgusting thing ever!  He chipped the paint! 
[03:58:00]  He chipped the paint, Antoine!  You want more?  No, she's asking me to bite it off.  No!  God damn it!  Bite it!  Bite it!  Just flick it.  Flick it.  Oh, God!  He's got his teeth in there!  Oh, God!  I'm going to vomit!  Oh, he's tugging!  He's tugging!  Oh, my!  Oh, my!  Oh, no!  Oh, God!  He's doing it more!  That sounds solicitous!  Okay, okay!  Enough! 
[03:58:30]  Uh, Ronnie?  Yeah?  We could top the Twato thing because, uh, Twato has friends, uh, around back, uh, I don't  know what it could work out here, but, uh, Paul.  I dare you!  Yeah.  You want him to go around back?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Polo, would you, listen, Sandy Kane.  All right, just go over.  Go ahead.  Drop.  All right, hold on.  Drop.  Oh, my God.  Wait, hold it.  Oh, my God.  He's going around back.  He's going around back.  Wait, wait, hold on.  Polo, you come around.  Oh, my God, Jesus. 
[03:59:00]  This is the most disgusting sight I've ever seen in my life.  Look, I've got to get over there.  And you've got to take a look at this.  Polo, you've got to get in deep.  Right?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, well.  Oh, God!  It's green.  Apparently, it's green.  It's green.  It's green.  Let me see, Sandy.  Polo.  Yeah, go ahead.  Polo, come on.  I'll start with the nose.  It's kissing.  Polo.  Polo.  Polo.  There he goes.  Sandy, open. 
[03:59:30]  Open.  Oh, my God.  His nose is in there.  Oh, my God.  You're insane.  Go ahead, Polo.  All right, the nose is very deep.  There he goes.  Get the mouth in there, Polo.  I cannot even tell you.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Wow.  I just poured bleach into my eyes, and I'm feeling better.  Sandy, what the hell is going on?  You ever heard of a depilatory or something?  What?  What do you use?  A depilatory? 
[04:00:00]  It's hairy and awful.  It's a big, hairy mess.  I've never seen a green one.  It was green.  It looked like a Venus flytrap.  It looked pretty good to me.  We had a very, very heavy version.  We had a very, very, very, very, very version tonight. 
[04:00:30]  We had a very, very, very, very version tonight.  We had a very, very, very, very version.  We had a very, very version.  We had a very, very version. 
[04:01:00]  We had a very, very, very version.  We had a very, very version.  The Opium Asian 
[04:01:30]  show is back. The O.P. and Anthony show is back. And better than ever. On Sirius XM.  Patton Oswalt in studio doing the Webby Awards tonight. That's going to be great.  Celebrate the internet. Celebrate the internet. Best ball sack video. Best under ball sack 
[04:02:00]  video. Best outrage tweet. Most offended. Most offended person, yes. There's actually  some pretty amazing, I've got to say, I've seen a lot of the videos they're giving awards.  One of the good things about when I host Webby's is I see a lot of stuff that I wasn't looking  at online because I'm usually looking at porn. And you're like, Jesus, people are, like the  next generation of filmmakers and creators are coming out of, remember how they used 
[04:02:30]  to come out of music videos in the 80s or before that it was, you know, little short  films and stuff. Now it's people on the internet like, oh, that guy's going to be a huge director  someday. What are some of the videos you saw that you never saw on your own? Well, there  was a, there's a video that an ad agency made about, it's a pro-gay marriage video that is  the most un-maudlin, like realistic, even if you're anti-gay marriage, it's so well done 
[04:03:00]  and actually makes such intelligent points. Can we see this? Yeah. I, I, I, I, I,  what is the name of it? It was a... Robert's Wedding? It was Sam Roberts, of course. Jason  Collins is, who's the guy that, the basketball player that came out? Is it Jason Collins?  I think so. He's introducing it and I, um, uh, I, I, now I can't think of the name. And  then there's also like stuff, um, from even, uh, websites like College Humor. Uh, there's  this, uh, young, uh, uh, uh, filmmaker named Oren Brimmer that does, um, short films for 
[04:03:30]  them who is, even though he's making funny parody videos, they're, they're brilliant and  they're really well done. It's really interesting to see because a lot of people, it's, um, they  can use the same equipment, the same everything. And you watch one thing and it sucks and looks  like shit and it's cheap. And then you watch something else and it's cinematic. It sounds  great. Yeah. It's got a storyline to it. The, the camera moves look beautiful and it's like 
[04:04:00]  giving someone a canvas and paint and brushes and saying, paint something brilliant. Just  because you have the equipment doesn't mean it could be brilliant. Yeah. And then, and  then meanwhile, uh, Jean-Michael Basquiat just had spray cans and was making art on walls.  Amazing art. Oh, they're giving an award to Banksy and, uh, and there's rumors that he  might be hiding in the, he's not going to show up, but he might be hidden in the audience  somewhere or something. But Banksy, a guy that just sprayed on walls and created a whole  new thing. Brilliant. And then there's, there's also a kid, I don't know if he's getting an 
[04:04:30]  award. He should. He's on Vine, uh, named King Bach, young, uh, black kid that makes these  six second Vines that are so fucking funny. And, and give him a sketch show. He understands  comedy in six seconds with his phone. Give us a couple of these. Uh, find some. Best  of King Bach. Yeah, do best of King Bach Vines. Oh. It's hard to do six seconds. He just 
[04:05:00]  walked by himself in the door. That's pretty good. Hang on. Yeah, we're done. Thank you.  Hey, man. Hey, what's your name? Oh, that's fucked up. We should like to see some magic.  Pick a card. Any card. Now memorize that card. Keep memorizing. Memorize.  Took his laptop and ran. Stuntless laptop. 
[04:05:30]  What are you doing? I thought you wanted a D. Come here in the photo. Selfie.  You gotta stop with the duck face. It snapped her neck.  Why'd he go? It snapped her neck. He didn't like the duck face.  Work face ass. Work face ass. Face ass. You pull.  Work face ass. Why am I? Would you like to play a game? A game?  Raise this baby. That ain't no game, nigga. That's life.  Oh, my God. Thank you.  Oh, come down, bitch. I'm just trying my shoelace and put the flower back in the base and need some water. 
[04:06:00]  Yes, I do.  Man, now. Where you from?  Oh, Christ.  Hey, man. Hold me back, man. I got this little nigga. Matrix. What's up, nigga? What's up?  What's up? What's up?  Hell.  You choking? I got you.  They're very obviously.  What?  They have to be fast.  I'm a dick, my nigga.  Who's there?  It's okay. We're blind.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Me too. I'm blind too. Let's start the show. Let's get off me.  My car. Darn it. I got you, bro.  Pulling car wash. Let's go. 
[04:06:30]  Please, please, drop.  Hey, no punchbacks.  Oh, shit.  Nigga, you all right?  Hey, you all right?  All right, man.  You got that gas money?  No, I only got my car.  Oh, that's all good.  Nigga.  You want to catch that?  Nigga.  My fault.  Yo, stop.  Yo, I love playing this game with Ramona. Show him. 
[04:07:00]  Crisscross.  Yeah.  Yeah, crisscross.  Yeah.  Crisscross.  I like her. What do I do?  Girls like bad boys.  Got it.  Hey, Batch.  What up, bitch?  What a jerk.  Now we're just watching.  Sorry, this is terrible radio.  It's horrible radio.  Very creative.  Very creative, yeah.  And again, six seconds, too.  Jesus.  A phone and six seconds and just...  That's all he has, right?  Yeah.  He's good. 
[04:07:30]  That's good.  Yeah, someone give him a show.  God damn it.  Where's he from?  The L.A. guy?  I don't know where he's from.  King Bach.  But his shit's funny.  On YouTube.  A six-second show.  But again, like, this is any new medium, there's always the, oh, these kids making a goddamn video.  Someone will always go, oh, I can do something actually cool with that.  Yeah, yeah, yep.  And Vine isn't really happening anymore because most people can't do shit with six seconds.  No, no.  They just can't do shit with it.  Vine's pretty much turned into people like that that can do something. 
[04:08:00]  Right, but the rest of it is full of shit.  But for the most part, yeah, people kind of...  There's two other people on Vine.  I cannot...  Now, this is embarrassing.  There's a blonde-haired college kid.  He's a wrestler.  Greg Hughes?  Ooh.  I don't know.  Ooh, college.  And then there's this girl, like, the D or something.  I know what her name is, and she's all...  They're, oh, I'm a terrible advocate for these people.  But they're also really, really funny.  I follow them on Twitter. 
[04:08:30]  I cannot think of their names right now.  He has six and a half million Vine followers.  He does?  Six point five million.  Well, King Bach.  Way to go, buddy.  And no one knew him before.  That's what's amazing.  And now he's about to get the O&A bump.  Damn.  The O&A bump.  Yeah, five point two he's going to have.  Ooh, the O&A bump.  I like that.  The O&A bump.  Yes.  It's usually under the cock crown.  Jesus Christ, Jimmy. 
[04:09:00]  Under the cock crown.  Oh, fuck.  That's great.  You guys really are about to go on vacation.  You guys could not be...  We are.  We're like, well...  This is...  I'm like, well...  Well, I have a plug.  Oh.  It's a big moment.  You do.  Here we go.  I have two plugs.  One is Tuesday night, I think.  I'm doing this thing with Rich Voss and his lovely wife.  Oh, right.  More night.  Where I have sex with her in front of him.  He does his jokes.  No, we're doing the live podcast at the Village Underground.  They have a great podcast, by the way. 
[04:09:30]  It is very good.  Oh, my God.  It's really funny.  I like it a lot.  They have a very cool marriage.  They just both have great senses of humor about each other.  They're both brutal to each other, and neither one of them gets upset about it.  Right.  The thing that she did...  She did a great pro-gay marriage video about with Voss, saying...  Not only am I...  My friends were saying, I'm not going to get married until my gay friends get married.  Well, I'm not going to divorce my husband until gay people are allowed to get married and get divorced.  She goes, and let me tell you what I'm deciding to stay with. 
[04:10:00]  And she shows you, like, the picture of Voss.  I'm going to stay married to this horror show where I could easily divorce him for probably a good chunk of money.  But that's how committed I am to gay marriage.  I'm going to stay married to this idiot who's really funny.  Yeah.  They're great together.  That podcast has been really fucking funny.  Rich Voss is my...  I think I told you guys the story that when I was working at the Winchester's Pub in Baltimore.  Oh.  For the Garvin's comedy.  You ever worked for Garvin's back in the day? 
[04:10:30]  I might have done an open mic for them in D.C. or something, but I never worked for it.  Baltimore.  Yeah.  Well, Baltimore and D.C.  They had a club in D.C.  They opened this place, the Winchester's Pub.  And their manager was this gay guy named Terry.  And Terry loved tormenting the comedian, especially the young guys that were really...  Like me, like, I'm nervous.  I want to do a good job.  Right.  I don't want him to send back a bad report to, you know, the guys who run Garvin's, Harry  Monacruces and stuff.  So that night I was doing the Winchester's Pub.  And then the next night I had to go up to Philadelphia, drive to Philadelphia. 
[04:11:00]  Like, after the show.  So it's super late, and I've done two shows, and I'm waiting to get my money.  And I'm like, hey, Terry, I have to drive to Philadelphia, so could I maybe get my money?  Because I also, if I didn't get that money, I didn't have enough gas in my car to make  it to Philadelphia.  So I had to get the money.  And it's $75.  Like, it's nothing.  And Terry's like, well, I don't know.  Maybe I still got to do stuff at the bars, so maybe you should just wait.  I'm like, well, it's 1.30 in the morning.  And gosh, I worked a job all day at this law firm, so I've been up since 6 a.m., and 
[04:11:30]  I would really, really love not to fall asleep in the car so I could just have my money and  then drive.  It's quite a long drive, Terry.  Well, I guess maybe you should just drink some coffee or maybe wait.  Like, he's just fucking with me, like, just because he can.  So then I'm, and I don't know what to say.  And I'm, you know, this is partially my fault.  I'm such a pussy.  So I go downstairs, because Rich Ross was the headliner, and he's still hanging around  downstairs.  And I go downstairs, and I'm really, like, almost in tears.  He's like, I don't know what to do. 
[04:12:00]  And Rich is like, what's your fucking problem?  And I go, well, you know, I need to drive to Philly, and I don't have my money, and he  won't give it to me.  And he's, and Rich just goes, God damn it.  And he just stomps up to me.  Hey, torch song!  Give the kid his fucking money!  Come on!  And, like, just starts screaming at him.  Sorry, sorry!  And just, like, gives me my money.  Oh, shit.  So I was like, fuck yeah, Rich.  And Rich bailed you out.  Yeah.  Good for Rich.  What a dick, though.  Yeah.  It's like just me.  Just because he could.  It was only because he could. 
[04:12:30]  There's nothing to gain from it.  Just, like, I can watch this young guy be nervous.  Suffer, right.  Yeah, and I'm just going to do it.  And then Rich just goes stomping upstairs.  What a little...  Yo, yo, torch song.  Give the kid his money.  What were you doing for a law firm?  I was clerking.  You didn't pass the bar at that point?  No, no, no.  God, no.  I was studying to be a paralegal just because there would be good money in it.  But it was that thing where I was up at 6 a.m., had to be in the law firm at 8. 
[04:13:00]  I would get off at 5.  I would take, like, a bathroom shower, get freshened up, and then go drive into the city, get some cheap Chinese food, and do the clubs.  Where was the law firm?  It was in Vienna, Virginia.  And I remember, uh, for lunch break, I would go in to the bathroom, take a giant...  I would unroll all this fucking toilet paper side of the big wad.  I would put it on that metal thing on the back of the toilet and sit backwards on the toilet and take a one-hour nap on my toilet paper pillow that was so exhausted. 
[04:13:30]  Toilet paper pillow on the toilet tank.  I was operating on, like, four hours sleep a night because I was doing this stuff, and I was just determined to...  So I was so exhausted.  That's fucking smart, though.  Yeah.  Why not go...  Yeah, beach going out to the car.  Yeah.  Well, unfortunately, we had to park in this lot where, when you go out to your car, it was just this oven.  You know, it was either an oven in the summer or an icebox in the winter, so I would just sit in there and...  Toilet.  Toilet nap.  That's best.  Take a little toilet nap.  You must be a good sleeper.  I was a horrible sleeper, but I would just do anything to get even... 
[04:14:00]  When I say an hour's sleep, I probably got actual 15 minutes of sleep, and then, you know, 45 minutes of shifting around.  People on either side of me, you know, just...  Exactly.  Did you have to look...  Did it take you a while to figure out how to sleep in there?  Oh, yeah.  Did you try forward on the toilet and be like, this thing worked?  Oh, no, no.  I needed some neck support.  It was a nightmare.  That's how I would say.  I could see going...  All right, if I spin around, I could rest my head on the tank thing or the little metal...  Oh, my gosh.  Maybe I could kneel.  Maybe I could kneel. 
[04:14:30]  I need something soft.  Toilet paper's soft.  I'll put the whole roll there.  No, this don't work.  Let me...  I bet there were a couple days where it was just my forearm.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But then the metal thing would indent on the other side, and that hurt.  A big bolt mark on your fucking arm.  It's like, well, that didn't work.  Oh, you know what?  Yeah.  Hey, there's toilet paper here.  If I use...  So I would make a toilet paper pillow.  Oh, that'd be a good name for a memoir.  Toilet paper pillow.  How much would you hate when you were just about to doze off and you heard the telltale sound  of a belt being loosened? 
[04:15:00]  And a huge sigh of relief, like...  And it was in the same stall.  Did you move over?  Did they ever kick you out?  Did you ever get caught?  No, because it was when most of the office would clear out.  Yeah.  And, you know, because I was doing...  I was indexing testimony all morning, so it was just this...  So try to imagine you're working on three hours sleep, bad coffee, like a couple Pop-Tarts,  and then that caffeine...  You get the caffeine spike, and then the crash hits. 
[04:15:30]  Yeah.  And you are reading through, you know, this, well, when I signed on to the construction project,  and I've got to, you know, index every...  It was just a nightmare.  Before computer referencing, right?  Exactly.  It was a way to do it all by hand.  Wow, yeah.  To give to the attorneys so that they could go through, and it was...  Oh, man.  That must have been odd for somebody coming in and looking under the stall and seeing  the feet facing the wrong way.  Wow.  Like, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?  Yeah.  He's doing a reverse cowgirl dump.  Well, how awful if it's your law case, your case, and you're like, where's the guy indexing? 
[04:16:00]  He's sleeping on the septic tank.  Let me go wake up.  With his toilet paper pillow.  Right.  Yeah, that was a nightmare.  He's got his face in an upper-decker.  Yes, exactly.  For vacation, he comes in, and he lounges in the urinal.  But there was, like, I cannot tell you how relieved I was where the one year, I think  after four years of doing stand-up, I made $11,000 in one year, and it was just enough 
[04:16:30]  for me to not have a day job.  I could live at poverty level just doing stand-up, and I felt like, I'm a fucking king.  I'm a king.  Now.  I can barely pay my rent.  I can buy a giant bag of rice, a bunch of cans of beans, and then I can go to a place  with free coffee refills and eat for free at the comedy club at night.  Good.  I got my life set.  I'm a comic now.  I'm perfect.  And I'm pulling in $11,000 a year in $19.91. 
[04:17:00]  So I'm feeling pretty good.  That is living live, my son.  Absolutely living live.  Oh, yeah.  11 Gs.  Could not believe it.  Like, I'm like, I broke double digits.  Wow.  I made 11 Gs, man.  I could not have been happier.  Holy shit.  I don't go into that fucking law firm in my shitty suit.  With my, I had five ties, two white shirts, and I would just rotate them because I had no  clothing.  How did you get your suit cleaned?  Like, that's expensive, right?  Thank God I didn't have to wear a suit. 
[04:17:30]  I could get them with a button-up shirt and a tie and then slacks.  I didn't have to wear a jacket.  And what about laundry?  Laundry, I knew a place.  I would sleep.  I would put, I had two pairs of slacks, and the day that I wasn't wearing one of them,  I would put it under my mattress to really make the crease sharp, to make it look like  it was okay, and hopefully no food stains got on it.  It was just, oh!  Doesn't it fucking creep you out?  And I would go to a drugstore, and I would get one of those five packs of white t-shirts, 
[04:18:00]  and the pit stains got so, I just, bro, I just toss them and buy a new pack every week.  Do you remember the last day there?  Your last day and how you felt?  God, you know what?  No, because what I remember more was making, like, oh, I'm at the point where I'm making  $3.50 a week as an emcee sometimes feature, so that was, I was celebrating that more than  I was, like, fuck, you're a firm, so, yeah.  Colin last year, he did a keynote speech, and he talked about, like, regrets, and one 
[04:18:30]  of his regrets, he said, was that at one point, making money doing comedy would have been  everything.  And he said, I kind of, I regret that I lost the joy in that, or the feeling of amazement  that I'm actually making a living doing this.  And as you're talking about pressing your pants, I'm like, it's, it's, can you imagine  at that point if you would have said, X amount of years later, I'll have this much money,  I'll be doing this, and there will still be complaints.  Yeah, I'll still be whining about stuff, yeah.  Before all of us, you know, you think, like, wow, what the fuck am I complaining about?  Yeah, yeah. 
[04:19:00]  But, I mean, those memories, for some reason, are still fresh in my head, so there's a lot  of stuff that I kind of, there's, trust me, there's stuff I complain about, but the fact  that I get to make money doing stand-up, that everything else is a fuck, it's a gravy.  To have worked for a living, and worked at something you fucking hated, it really does  give you a great appreciation for where you are.  Actually, you know what was even worse for me?  It wasn't that I had a job I hated.  That would have been one thing, like a job that I, because hatred would have still been 
[04:19:30]  an emotion.  I had a job that I was so absolutely indifferent, it meant nothing to me.  And I was making okay money, I made, by the way, when I, when I got 11 grand a year,  and then just decided to be a stand-up, I took a huge pay drop when I left the law firm,  but it was the fact that if that job had gone away, I would have only missed the money.  I wouldn't have been like, you know, oh, well, fuck that, I had zero feelings about, like,  and to spend, like, it's eight hours a day for something that I feel nothing about.  Yeah, yeah. 
[04:20:00]  Absolute numbness.  No, I never wanted to be a lawyer.  It seems like such a waste when you're there doing it, and it's just, just for the money.  And there were people in the law, there were a couple of lawyers in the law firm that really,  truly loved the law, and they were passionate, and that you could tell they were happy to  come in.  Yep.  And there were a couple, and I won't name them, that they were just like, it was clear either  their parents had made them do it, or they just were like, well, it'll be this much  money, so I'll have that money.  And they, they didn't, again, they didn't even hate being lawyers.  They didn't care either way.  Oh, no. 
[04:20:30]  And so I was like, I, by the way, I know, I know a couple of, um, pretty big name actors  and, uh, big name comedians that are totally indifferent about what they do.  Just telling you.  Wow.  I'm like, why are you doing it?  Well, were they kind of, were they kind of shitty lawyers who, like, you know, I don't  want to say their names, you know, Darden, Clark.  I, I, I ran into, um, God, who was the guy, and he died.  He was on OJ's team.  Johnny Cochran.  Not Johnny Cochran, the, the white dude.  Kardashian.  Oh, yeah.  I was at some function this year ago when Kardashian was there, and I wasn't talking to him, but 
[04:21:00]  I heard someone talking to him, and they were saying, hey, I saw Marsha Clark, like, at  some other big name case, and he was like, uh, oh, was she watching how an actual real  lawyer does it, or something like that?  Like, just, uh, because, however you feel about OJ, the, the, the prosecution team was  so horrible.  They stunk.  Yeah, they were really bad.  We all knew how bad they were, and we, we had no experience.  One of those guys at the Comedy Cellar one night, Bill Hodgman, I think he was originally  the guy assigned to it, and then they, first of all, they probably did it because they wanted 
[04:21:30]  a white woman, not a black, a white man to prosecute, but I think he had health issues.  Oh.  So me and Godfrey talked to him downstairs, and we took pictures with him, and I got him  to sign something, um, and, and he wrote, Dear Jim, he did it.  And he signed his name.  Wow.  That was his autograph.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  It was a very funny autograph.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, yeah, like that, these, just seeing people, look, doing something that you hate for no  money, that's one thing, like, you're doing it because that's, you're starting out. 
[04:22:00]  Right.  But when you see someone that they are wealthy doing something that they hate or are indifferent  to, that's just a tragic, tragic waste of your life.  You've got to just really be miserable.  Yeah, like, just don't do it.  You don't even do other things.  There's way more money other places.  Damn.  Way less aggravation.  I, I, I forgot who said that saying that there's a lot of accountants that should actually  be ballerinas.  There's also a lot of ballerinas who should be accountants.  And they'd be way happier. 
[04:22:30]  Both ways.  It goes, it cuts both ways.  Yeah.  Sometimes you gotta wonder, why am I unhappy?  Is it because I'm the type of person that once I'm comfortable, nothing is good enough  anymore, and I always have to change?  Right.  Is it a personality flaw and not the job?  Yeah.  Or do you suspect that the happiness will go away because you have experience with, I've  had highs that have been crashed, so then I've been conditioned not to trust joy or to  be wary of it, of it going away.  I don't know.  Your, your job is such a big part of your life.  Oh, yeah. 
[04:23:00]  Like, it's, it's your daily fucking thing that you have to do.  Right.  And if you're miserable doing it, it's going to fuck up your entire, the rest of your life.  Yeah.  There's no way you can just leave your shit job that you're miserable with and then  just, all right, well, I leave that at the office.  Right.  Or, like, come on, there's going to be problems.  Yeah.  It's amazing that we've, we're kind of, you know, got that ball and chain of a job around  your ankle like that.  Yeah.  I carry it everywhere, though.  I just, everywhere I go, I'm just bringing laughter.  You are.  You bring joy. 
[04:23:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah.  You don't walk, you cartwheel.  Cartwheel everywhere.  Here comes Jim.  Yeah, here he comes.  Oh, my God.  Where are all these animated birds coming?  Oh, it's Jim.  Jim's coming.  There's a little ray of sunshine coming through the clouds.  I never understood the people that were completely content in those jobs, too, because when I  was working in the construction industry, air conditioning and heating industry, all I  wanted to do was get out of it. 
[04:24:00]  But there were people there that, and I was always doing something to try to get out of  it, you know, some type of creative thing, something.  And there were guys that were just, that was their job.  They knew they were never going to leave it.  Had no, no aspirations to leave.  So it's like, what the fuck do you want to do this for?  Plus, they got to pay their bills.  Yeah, yeah.  But you also have to understand, there are some people, and it's hard for, because there's  people, it's hard for them to understand how we can do what we do.  There are some people that putting in an air conditioning system and doing it right, that 
[04:24:30]  is art to them.  Oh, yeah.  That, they get real satisfaction, and that's a big deal for them, or building a wall, like  laying bricks perfectly.  Yeah.  That's a gorgeous thing for them.  That wall, that's mine.  That's mine.  I did that.  I did that.  Yeah.  There's something kind of nice about that.  Now, drive against it at fucking 80, would you please?  Don't you drive up and down the LIE saying, hey, I did that building.  God damn it.  I have.  I've seen those.  I know.  It's up on the rooftop, I landed those. 
[04:25:00]  Well, there's some...  But try to go in that building now and visit your work.  Yeah, sure.  They'll have you removed.  Somewhere there are printed case histories that I helped index.  There you go.  In a law firm library somewhere, there's my handiwork.  Yes.  A bunch of men being released who shouldn't...  Yeah, I did something in West Memphis years ago about these...  I made a mistake.  Yeah, I just remember, I just wrote heavy metal slash guilty.  Guilty, guilty, devil guilty.  Yeah, black t-shirt, dead.  Yeah.  Guilty.  Alfred something. 
[04:25:30]  I don't remember what it was.  The worst law clerk in history.  I liked the law, though.  I wanted to be a lawyer in high school.  Really?  Really?  My original goal was...  But it was more of a performance desire, like Pacino and Injustice for All.  It was that moment in front of the jury shit where you're...  Not the other shit.  But really, I mean, I can think of a bunch of comedians.  Bill Burr comes to mind immediately.  Who would probably be an amazing litigator for arguing a point and swaying... 
[04:26:00]  That's true.  He's got to sway...  Bill's good.  Bill Burr has to sway a theater full of drunks.  Now, if he's got 12 sober people in a box, he could annihilate them.  Yeah, that's true.  But Bill has too bad of a temper.  Yeah, he would...  And Bill's fucking Boston childhood rage would come out.  Oh, no, no, that's what he said.  He's like, oh, God, he's a psychopath.  Yeah, that guy's...  No, no, people, you're no better.  Fuck him.  Put him in prison.  I don't care.  Bullshit, you just said.  Bullshit.  Read it back.  Read it back.  You're out of your fucking mind. 
[04:26:30]  You know that laugh he does?  Whatever those Bill Burr's laugh is.  But picture that laugh, followed by bloody child's underpants.  I guess he would be terrible at it, after all.  He's smart enough to do it, though.  He's a good enough debater.  Yeah, yeah, he would.  I mean, that's one of the reasons I did debate in forensics in high school.  And anyone that I...  Whenever a teenager is like, hey, I want to be a comedian, like, go tomorrow for free.  You can get stand-up training for free in your high school.  Go do forensics and debate. 
[04:27:00]  What's forensics and debate?  Debate is...  You know, debate is debate.  Forensics is public speaking.  You either do an interpretation of a speech.  I would do Monty Python routines for a humorous interpretation, dramatic and humorous interpretation.  But then with debate, you would do extemporaneous debate, which is where, with no preparation,  they just go...  Like, they would just go, you're pro-abortion, you're anti, you've got five minutes, you're  about to go argue it.  And you're like, oh, shit.  And then you've got to form your arguments quickly.  And the best way to win an extemporaneous debate is to crack jokes and crack the other 
[04:27:30]  side up.  And so you learn very quickly to disarm people that way.  And you also, when I was doing humorous interpretation, I read Monty Python's The Bookshop  Sketch.  And you really learn, because you've got to write it out to memorize it.  You learn how to write, oh, that's how you land a joke.  That's what it looks like on paper.  That's it.  So all that, if there's any high schoolers listening that want to be a comedian, you've  got free training for four years if you take it.  Fuck that. 
[04:28:00]  I'll just, like, go up there.  I'm funny.  I'm funny.  My friends fucking laugh.  Fuck that shit.  I remember I was in a room full of mafioso and I swayed them with a laugh.  I said, after all, we had not lawyers.  And then I laughed.  Nice.  Very good.  Good save.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Are our phones here?  Phone guy here yet?  Uh-oh.  We're getting free Samsung today.  Free phone.  What?  Yeah.  I'm getting mine.  Yeah, we're part of the white glove.  Hello. 
[04:28:30]  You're bailing on the free phone today.  Yeah, I've got to get home real quick.  Unfortunately, I have to leave soon, too, because I have to go rehearse the Webbys.  Oh!  We have rehearsal today, blocking and rehearsal and going over my crazy monologue.  It's going to be...  I've got a lot of funny quips.  Is it internet-related stuff?  Yeah.  I haven't seen a faster download since I had all that Indian food.  Get it?  It's a shit-shot. 
[04:29:00]  There you go.  Oops.  You call that a reposting?  Tweets you.  I hardly know you.  Yeah.  Oh, but you know it, folks.  Yeah.  Oh!  Let's get the fuck out of Dodge.

If you want to be a part of today's Post Show, we do it every day.  Wrapping up everything that went down on today's O.P. and Anthony show.  How great was Patton Oswalt?  So cool to have guys like that that are not only amazing guests, but they're fans of the show. 
[04:37:30]  Like, he's coming in talking about what has been happening on the show recently that he has been enjoying.  It's a rare thing for a guest to be that good and to be that big of a fan.  I mean, you hear some of the callers that call in.  The callers are all big fans of the show, but a lot of them are not good guests.  Not whatsoever.  A lot of them are very, very bad.  For Patton Oswalt to be this big a fan and to be this good a guest is an amazing thing.  We got to revisit Spaz for a little while today. 
[04:38:00]  Told some wrestling jokes about Vince McMahon losing money.  Of course.  All about the Billboard Music Awards.  DJ Who Kid just stopped in.  Hell yeah.  You excited about Michael Jackson hologram?  Hell yeah.  You are, right?  Now, you met Michael Jackson.  Hell yeah.  Did that hologram look like Michael Jackson to you?  Hell no.  It didn't, right?  You didn't think so?  Some people were calling in today, one guy, and he said that the hologram was a video of 
[04:38:30]  a Michael Jackson impersonator.  Yeah, I had a feeling it was that, too.  But don't you think that the, I mean, it's not like the hologram is just a video being projected  onto the stage.  Don't you think it's like a video game character where it's not actually a photo of Michael Jackson?  It's like a digital tribute.  It's a digital tribute.  Yeah, it's nothing crazy.  Like when a girl shoves a finger inside of you.  A digital tribute.  I mean, yeah.  Digits.  Digital.  I mean, when the Tupac thing came out, everybody was shocked because... 
[04:39:00]  But that didn't really look that much like Tupac either.  But the Tupac, I mean, the hologram was dancing with Snoop Dogg.  It humped.  It was a little much.  You didn't see when it humped?  It humped.  It did it.  Yeah, this one was more like a tribute.  Well, it was moonwalking, but I didn't know we had the technology to make holograms hump.  Hell yeah.  Wow.  Dr. Dre got it somehow.  I don't know.  Well, if anybody's going to get it.  Tupac humped.  That's all I know.  If anybody's going to get it.  Let's find out what today's line of the day was.  We have Patton Oswalt in studio today. 
[04:39:30]  Oh, that's hot.  This is a very funny show.  Let's find out what the line of the day was.  Here comes the light of the day, light of the day, light of the day, light of the day.  Man, this guy looks, this guy looks, you know, almost like Michael Jackson.  So why wouldn't you go, okay, what, what do I need on my face to like bring home a load?  To really, a child. 
[04:40:00]  Because they're almost, you like that one, a child on his face.  That was funny.  Did you watch last night?  I saw a little bit of it.  What did you think?  I mean, it's like seeing the same performances over and over for some reason.  No, you're right.  It's the same people.  Same rappers, same people.  Yeah, Miley Cyrus is going to do something outrageous.  Tongue out and all that.  Lorde is going to, everybody's going to be like, wow, she can really sing.  I'm just mad I miss Ratatouille.  I should have came a little earlier. 
[04:40:30]  Is that why you like Patton Oswalt?  I interviewed him for Matt Wright.  That's my favorite cartoon of all time.  Ratatouille is?  Yeah.  Why?  I'm a bitch to that shit.  You had sex with a woman while watching Ratatouille.  That's how much you like the movie.  I like the, I don't know.  I like cartoons and sex.  Well, I read in the New York Times that you go to sleep eating Frosted Flakes.  Hell yeah.  And then you have sex watching cartoons.  Yeah.  What's it, what's it, so is Ratatouille, is it your favorite cartoon to enjoy or do you  find that to be the most sexual? 
[04:41:00]  I like it when, because you know, Ratatouille is like a gooey, like, snack.  Oh, okay.  It's sexual too.  A lot of people don't know that Ratatouille is used during Arab sexual acts.  I had no idea.  Is that true?  I go to Dubai a lot.  That's how I know these things.  Do they, do they fuck desserts?  No, they just put it on themselves.  Oh, okay.  So they just start rubbing Ratatouille on themselves.  That's why the connection with Micah Jackson works so well, because when I met Micah Jackson,  he had a little bit of Ratatouille on his chest.  Really?  Yeah.  And that must have been from?  In Bahrain.  Yeah, from the Arabs. 
[04:41:30]  From some sexual acts.  He probably did, but, uh...  Now, do you think he was inviting you, the fact that he had Ratatouille on his chest?  Maybe he was inviting you to maybe...  Uh, I don't think so.  You don't think so?  You didn't get that vibe from him?  Yeah, a little laugh on him, a little giggle.  He cursed, right?  Yeah, he cursed, too.  That was crazy.  That sounds crazy.  Because I was letting him know that they were about to confiscate or they were about to  take his, uh, Neverland.  Like, fuck that shit, man.  I don't care about that shit, yo.  He dropped the N-word at all?  Uh, nah.  He didn't.  Ah, that's too bad.  Would you have flipped out if you had heard Michael Jackson using the N-word?  Uh, I would be surprised, but he lost his niggerism, like, 20 years ago. 
[04:42:00]  Oh, so Michael can't even use...  He can't use the word anymore.  Yeah, he's white, so...  Yeah, so I'd be...  You'd be offended.  No, I would be offended.  You would be.  Because he's white.  Right.  And you're white.  And that's how white Michael Jackson is.  Yeah, he's whiter than you.  That's crazy.  Well, now he's not any kind.  Now he's just...  He's whiter than me because he's bone, rotting away.  You're a little beige right now.  And everybody's talking about the hologram tribute as if it's the first time it's been done.  Like, nobody's being like, yeah. 
[04:42:30]  Like, everybody's like, wow, wasn't it a little creepy to see a dead guy hologram on stage?  And it's like, we just...  There's so many holograms out there that people are like, they did the biggie one.  They did a biggie hologram?  I think they did a biggie one.  There's like, even a lot of dead ones.  I mean, because we saw the Tupac one like two summers ago.  Yeah.  And nobody's being like, yeah, we saw the hologram.  We know it's possible.  I mean, I cried a little bit, you know, tear went...  And the Tupac one?  Yeah, the tear went down my cheek, then I sniffed it back in my nose.  Why?  I mean, it's...  Just getting all the juices going together?  It's crazy.  So were you crying when he was humping? 
[04:43:00]  I laughed at that part.  You liked that part?  But when he danced with Snoop, I was kind of amped up.  It was emotional?  Mm.  The Michael Jackson one was not as emotional?  Nah, because I met him, and he had Rat Tatooine on it.  You're like, it's all good.  Pat Oswald.  I wanted to let Pat Oswald know that experience.  I always thought Rat Tatooine was just a rat.  I didn't know anything about the dessert.  That was...  No, it's like a little gluttony snack.  What other cartoons do you watch?  You don't want to know.  No, I guess I don't.  Charlotte's Web. 
[04:43:30]  When you have sex, you watch Charlotte's Web?  That's like an emotional story.  It's like a tearjerker, isn't it?  When you have a pig and a spider, it's just like, it's crazy.  Oh, it feels very sexual.  You're saying it was more than meets the eye with that pig and that spider.  Because it looked like they wanted to fuck, but they had that love.  The sizes is why they didn't fuck.  Right, because obviously the pig would have hit Charlotte from the back.  I don't think you would have hit him at all.  But if he had done that, then the spider would have died. 
[04:44:00]  Charlotte would have been crushed.  I mean, it relates to me.  Because, you know, my dick is big and the pussies are usually small.  Oh, so they're scared of you.  It's like a Charlotte's Web.  Intimidated.  Episode every time I ask.  And also, you'll shoot a web with your dick.  And you'll write your name or whatever.  You'll write a little message.  Spider dick.  Spider dick.  That's right.  I hear they call you.  That's incredible.  Sal?  Yeah, Sam?  Do you have a favorite clip from today?  Yeah, I do.  Sam, one thing really quick.  Ratatouille is not a dessert.  What?  It's not. 
[04:44:30]  What is it?  It's like a soup.  It's a vegetable dish with like a broth.  Is it gooey?  Yeah, I mean, because it's like the vegetables are kind of gooey.  You can put your dick in it, yeah.  But could you see yourself spreading it all over yourself in the middle of a sex act?  Absolutely not.  No.  Okay, so who can make it out of his mind?  You don't like the taste of garlic and salt?  I mean, I guess I do, but not in the sex as well.  Like, that's dinner.  Your girl likes it too, right?  Your girl likes garlic and salt, right?  Well, sure.  Everybody likes garlic and salt.  It's a great seasoning.  If you put it on your chest, your wife wouldn't lick it? 
[04:45:00]  I don't know for sure.  I don't know if garlic and salt is what you would like.  I mean, maybe something sweet, like some chocolate syrup or something.  I always want a voice to turn me on, man.  It does.  It does.  It's just something that's associative.  No homo, though, but you know.  No, I understand.  It's associative is all that is.  How do you know so much about French culture, Sal?  Because I like French food.  I mean, that's like the most quintessential French dish.  Yeah, but you know what it sounds like when you say, I like French food?  It sounds like French food is code word for dick. 
[04:45:30]  No.  That's what it does.  And I saw the, I actually really like that movie.  That movie is fucking awesome.  I read that too.  And he makes it in the movie, yeah.  La femme c'est bon.  Is that you calling Sal a femme?  No, I said the movie was great.  Oh, I thought you were just calling him a femme.  No, no, no, French.  Look, his accent's really good.  Yeah, he's Republican.  Because he's Haitian.  He's not impressive.  He's not worldly.  He's Haitian.  Nigga, I'm French, nigga.  Let's go to Big D in Kentucky.  What's up, Big D? 
[04:46:00]  Hey, Sam.  How are you doing, buddy?  I was doing okay.  Now I'm a little confused.  Well, you know, Sal was out there with the, you know, I called before about Sal being  out there with Fez and the camping trip and whatnot.  Right, right.  You remember that?  You remember Sal's camping trip, right, Hoekind?  I love that bonfire or whatever.  Thank you.  All dudes.  Sal just likes eating that ratatouille that makes you think Fez is fucking semen, man.  Oh, he's off his chin, down his...  Why don't you fucking stutter a little more through a fucking French lady dumb fucking hick? 
[04:46:30]  Is it a semen thing?  No, it has nothing to do with that.  It's just food.  God forbid someone says they like anything around here.  It's, oh, he's a dick.  You know, Blair.  Well, don't lie.  You know you like a big cock in your ass and your mouth and you like dribbles and everything  Why don't you just go fuck your cousin, you stupid fucking hick?  Why would I do that?  Why would I...  Go shut the fuck up.  Why don't you go cook some fucking fried chicken with lard, you piece of shit.  Uncultured fucking loser.  If you can't handle the heat, stay the fuck out of the ratatouille. 
[04:47:00]  A ratatouille?  What the fuck are you saying?  You're so uncultured and stupid, you piece of shit.  Hey, at least we fuck our sisters where I live at.  Right, exactly.  You fucking piece of garbage.  Why do the fans of this show hate Sal?  I really cannot understand this shit, man.  Sal sounds like Andy Kaufman cutting a wrestling promo in the 70s in the South.  This right here is called soap.  You can wash with it and get that odor away. 
[04:47:30]  Salve.  That's soap in French, nigga.  Oh, okay.  How do you say the N-word in French?  Nigga.  That sounds very...  No, it's neg.  It's neg, right?  I know the slang term is they call black people, they call them baboons.  What?  Yeah, baboon.  Yeah.  That's what they call black people in Paris?  I don't mind you calling me that.  I would never do that to you, Hukit.  I feel like it'd be disrespectful.  I mean, you know, if I fuck your wife, you call me a baboon. 
[04:48:00]  Please don't fuck my wife to find out.  Don't fuck your wife, man.  She's a nice person.  That's what I'm saying, but I don't know why you didn't even bring that up.  I'm just giving you an example why that word comes out.  Oh.  Oh, like if you gave me a reason to be mad at you.  Baboon.  Then I'd call you baboon, and you'd be like, okay, I understand.  But you would say baboon.  Baboon.  And you'd be like, well, I did fuck his wife.  I understand.  Gotta give him that one.  Gotta give him that one.  I would never fuck your wife.  She's so nice, yo.  Thank you.  Yeah, she has a nice face.  What does that mean?  I mean, she has a nice face, man.  Wait, I don't understand what that means.  I've seen the way you behave around people. 
[04:48:30]  I don't understand what that leads to.  Don't look at your wife like that, bitch.  I'm just saying, but you said that nice face is like, you know, you can tell people deep  throat, nice face.  She's not in the cartoons.  She's not in the rat tattoo.  Okay, so you don't want to watch cartoons.  No Pat and Oswald with her.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, Sal, let's hear your clip real quick.  It was that thing where I was up at 6 a.m., had to be in the law firm at 8.  I love that shit.  I would get off at 5.  I would take like a bathroom shower, get freshened up, and then go drive into the  city, get some cheap Chinese food, and do the clubs. 
[04:49:00]  Where was the law firm?  It was in Vienna, Virginia.  And I remember for lunch break, I would go in to the bathroom, take a giant, I would  unroll all this fucking toilet paper, so I had a big wad.  I would put it on that metal thing on the back of the toilet and sit backwards on the  toilet and take a one-hour nap on my toilet paper pillow.  That was so exhausted.  Toilet paper pillow on the toilet tank.  Because I was operating on like four hours sleep a night because I was doing the stuff  and I was just determined to, so I was so exhausted. 
[04:49:30]  That's fucking smart, though.  Yeah.  Why not go, yeah, a beach going out to the car.  Yeah.  That's great, because that's one of those things where, where's Pat?  He's in the bathroom.  What, are you going to bother him?  He's obviously got some kind of tummy upset again.  That pillow thing is crazy, though.  Yeah, I never thought about that.  Toilet paper pillow?  I guess so.  Have you ever tried that?  What was he doing?  Taking a long shit?  No, napping.  Oh.  He had to take a nap.  I thought he took a dump.  No, he wasn't taking, oh, his dump is going to take a while.  I'm going to need some rest.  I'm going to need some R&R while I'm here. 
[04:50:00]  No shit.  Realizing that the bat, yes shit.  No, actually, you're right.  No shit.  Who could, you just heard his voice and you just thought he was the mouse.  That's all.  That's all I'm thinking about, man.  Who could started rubbing his genitals while you were playing that clip and he wasn't paying attention.  He's still short, too.  Who, Patton?  He's on the shorter side, I suppose.  He's almost a rat size.  Just thinking about the cartoon again.  Like a New York rat.  You ever saw a New York rat?  I have seen, dude.  We walked to the studio, you know, at like 4.35 o'clock in the morning.  There's a supermarket a couple blocks down. 
[04:50:30]  Yeah.  Every morning.  Get out of here.  There's raccoon-sized rats running back and forth in front of that supermarket.  I would never shop in that supermarket.  What street is that?  It's on like 50th.  Oh, okay.  Because when I was in the village, I saw a rat with pink shorts.  He was wearing pink shorts.  Did you see any of them with skinny jeans or is that for the fall?  That's for the fall.  That's for the fall, right?  Pink shorts is heavy out there.  I guess it's one of them rainbow rats.  Pink shorts is heavy with the rats. 
[04:51:00]  Is that right?  Down there, yes.  Down there, anyway.  I've done that before.  There have been times...  You wore pink shorts before?  No, I'm not talking about the pink shorts anymore.  Oh, good.  I don't wear pink shorts.  What underwear you got on right now?  None of your business, quite frankly.  What difference does it make to you what kind of underwear you got on?  Sal, this guy's commando today, man.  I'm not commando, and Sal doesn't care.  Sal doesn't care.  Questions for who can come in and Mike in Indiana.  Yo, hey, how's it going, guys? 
[04:51:30]  What's up, buddy?  I missed something.  Who, kid?  Why do you want to fuck a rat?  Why is it that you want to fuck a rat and who, kid?  Nah, it's like a subliminal connection.  It's like I have a big cock and the pussy's small, so when you see something like a small  animal, that's the pussy.  Right, like a rat.  So you want to kind of fuck a rat.  It's like a metaphor.  Right, I understand.  You got to think two layers deeper, right?  I get it.  There have been times, like not in years, never here, but back in...  Especially like back in the K-Rock days, when we started earlier, I was getting in here 
[04:52:00]  at like 4.30 in the morning.  We were doing five-hour shows instead of four-hour shows.  If I had had a rough night the night before, if I had been out the night before or something,  it would definitely be like, I need five minutes to shut my eyes.  You go sit down on the toilet, shut the stall door.  Wow.  And that's where you shut your eyes.  That's the place.  Because nobody's going to bother you.  So you don't think about little pussies when you're in there?  No, man.  Why would I think about little pussies in the bathroom?  I don't know.  Have you ever seen a little pussy in the bathroom?  It's a men's room.  In my world, every pussy's small. 
[04:52:30]  But, I mean, I don't know that world.  We've talked about this.  You don't have a big fucking dick.  I mean, I don't have the big WhoKid monster penis.  Hell no, you don't.  No, I don't.  Well, WhoKid, we'll have to hear more about your penis tomorrow.  Because we're out of here for today.  Okay.  But we will be live tomorrow.  Don't get confused.  A lot of people trying to figure out when the O&A vacation starts.  Doesn't start today.  God damn it.  And that's great news then.  For them, not for me.  We'll all see you here tomorrow.
