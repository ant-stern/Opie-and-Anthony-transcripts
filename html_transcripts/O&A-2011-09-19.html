<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with guest host Larry King, employing his characteristically colorful language, before transitioning into a discussion sparked by Jimmy Norton nearly quitting due to the show's inferior technical setup compared to his cousin's sports broadcast, "Live from the Compound." This led to a broader conversation about technological advancements in visual effects and their impact on filmmaking.  The Emmy Awards became the next target of their critique, focusing on the perceived lack of humor and stale format.  Specific criticisms were leveled at Ricky Gervais's pre-recorded segment, Jane Lynch's response, the awkward "Emmy Tones" performances (including Joel McHale), and the overall performances of several other celebrities.

The show then delved into a variety of other topics, including George Lucas's Star Wars alterations ("Greedo shoots first"), Liam Neeson's *Taken* franchise, the new Foreigner singer compared to Steve Perry (with a Dean Castronova vocal clip played), the new *Charlie's Angels* reboot, and William Friedkin's criticisms of modern Hollywood filmmaking.  Throughout this segment, numerous audio clips were played, and the hosts delivered a steady stream of profanity and crude humor.

A significant portion of the broadcast addressed the excessive commercialization of sports broadcasts.  A caller, Matt from D.C., detailed the pervasive advertising at a Redskins game, including sponsored porta-potties.  This discussion expanded to include stadium naming rights, the NFL (with commentary on the Patriots, Jets, Bills, and Cowboys, and Tom Brady's passing yards), the decline of strong running backs, and criticisms of sports talk radio.  Another caller, Joe from Philly, brought up NBC's failed experiment with a commentary-free football broadcast.  The conversation further explored team loyalty, focusing on the lack of sustained success for L.A. football teams and the Florida Marlins.  Jimmy Norton's Cowboys fandom was also humorously explored.

The show included a "F.U." message call-in segment, followed by Jim Florentine recounting a disturbing childhood experience involving a wrestling memorabilia salesman.  The Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Victor Ortiz boxing match's controversial ending and Mayweather's post-fight interview (featuring highly offensive language) were extensively analyzed, with multiple callers sharing their perspectives.  The hosts also discussed the "Heidi Game" and Gwyneth Paltrow improvising during a malfunctioning Emmys teleprompter.  Their commentary extended to their dislike of modern women's fashion, concluding with a mention of upcoming guests Stephen Wright and Tony Bennett.  A further detailed discussion of the Mayweather-Ortiz fight, including repeated use of offensive language and racial slurs, took place, further dissecting the referee's performance and Mayweatherâ€™s post-fight outburst against Larry Merchant.

Comedian Stephen Wright joined the show in studio, discussing his appearance on Louie C.K.'s show and negative celebrity encounters.  The conversation touched upon acting, dealing with hecklers, and Tony Bennett's delayed arrival. A snippet of an Amy Winehouse and Tony Bennett song played.  The in-studio interview with Tony Bennett followed, covering his career, working with other performers (including Liberace), industry changes, and his longevity.  Steven Wright also briefly mentioned upcoming tour dates.  The show continued with discussions of *Goodfellas*, the "Bobo dating game" (featuring audio clips), and an upcoming compound Halloween party.

A segment heavily featured anecdotes about "Uncle Paul," focusing on his drunken behavior and alleged inappropriate actions towards the hosts as children.  This transitioned into further inappropriate and sexually suggestive discussions involving their childhood.  Bobo, a show fan, became the target of significant ribbing for his perceived lack of humor, entitlement, and self-awareness.  Jim Norton discussed his success, diet, and late nights, while the hosts mocked his physical attributes.  A Star Wars Blu-ray giveaway created a humorous competition between the hosts and a producer (Travis).  Ron Bennington joined the conversation, contributing to a debate on whether Tony Bennett was their biggest celebrity guest, followed by anecdotes from the Bennett interview.  The show concluded with a plug for a friend's cancer benefit event and a mention of Roland's disruptive behavior during a commercial break.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:01:00]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:02:30]  O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:03:00]  O.P. and Anthony show.  What the hell am I doing here? 
[00:03:30]  Wait a minute.  You want me to intro the O.P. and Anthony show?  You got it.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the O.P. and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, fuck yeah!  This place is insane!  You guys like to cuss on that, though.  Yeah, I think a lot.  It's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews.  Yes, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  Well, it's not the most talked about, it's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it. 
[00:04:00]  This show is so disorganized.  This show is so disorganized.  Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  O.P. and Anthony were saying that, well, then turn off God dang O.P. and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts, and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one of the highlights of my career, the O.P. and Anthony show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Huh?  Ah, we could do that.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:04:30]  Hi.  Jimmy's back.  Jimmy's back.  Jimmy's back.  I didn't care for being gone that long.  You were gone a long time, sir.  The last day was unplanned.  That was a decision they asked me for a week of.  Oh.  I tried on Friday to get fired.  You missed a doozy.  What happened?  Oh, boy.  We don't want to rehash this, do we?  I literally didn't hear anything.  Honestly, it was.  Certain things.  It was Anthony's fault.  I had nothing.  I was in a good mood.  And then Anthony brought up like, hey, man, my cousin's doing a little, you know, he did his first sports show from Live from the Compound. 
[00:05:00]  I'm like, really?  Yeah, my little cousin.  It was cool.  So he pops it up.  And I just finally had it because his cousin has never done radio before.  And his first broadcast looked great.  It looked better than anything we've ever had in our careers.  And I just, like, said, fuck this place.  It just looked good here.  It looks like a TV show. 
[00:05:30]  And this kid has no radio training.  He pulled it off.  He did all right.  Yeah, it was, like, ballsy and fucking, you know, cocky.  So, Ant's Live from the Compound sounds way better than these mics do.  And visually was amazing.  It looked like it was a network TV show.  So I just fucking lost it.  And I told Ant just before the mics went on and just before you came in, we could say and do whatever we want because no one cares.  It was so bad on Friday, Jimmy.  Really.  It was so bad.  I said, Bob's going to call me today. 
[00:06:00]  Literally expected a phone call.  The bosses are going to have a problem with what I said or we said because Ant was in on it a bit, too.  Sure.  Nah.  No problem.  Nah.  They weren't concerned either way.  Like, you know, we have an asshole employee or, uh-oh, we kind of like the Opie and Anthony show.  And it looks like, you know, one of the guys is really unhappy.  We should kind of see what that's all about.  Nah, nothing.  Maybe they're getting used to it.  Maybe they're like, you know what?  These guys do this on the air.  There's nothing we can do about it.  Well, Greenstein begged us a while ago to stop with the complaining. 
[00:06:30]  But I begged him, how about you change a few things and then we'll complain less.  It's as simple as that because I want to be here.  I want to do this shit.  Doing the show.  But look at this.  Look how nice that looks.  We don't have to rehash this, but I'm just filling Jimmy in.  The mics are way better.  That's not the cousin that spilled the beer, is it?  No, that's his brother.  That was his brother.  Really?  Yeah, but it all comes out in the wash.  Like, it may look good, but there are problems with the new guys.  Yeah, all of a sudden, you know, a beer is being passed over the mixing board and then, whoopsie. 
[00:07:00]  I like the background.  It looks great.  Yeah, it's like a little sports background.  That looks nothing like Anthony's basement.  No.  That looks nothing like your basement.  I know.  It's just amazing.  So, there you go.  Technology.  I love it.  So, Ann just popped that up to kind of brag a little bit and it just set me off on Friday.  It looks great.  And I just assumed someone would call, but no one called.  So, I guess we could say and do whatever the fuck we want around here, which is a nice feeling.  Yeah, why not?  We should try murder.  It's murder.  This is watching, like, how good graphics get and, like, how amazing virtual shit is. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  In a couple of years, can you imagine what they're going to, like, do with interaction?  Like, you're going to be able to put yourself in movies.  You're going to be able to just take out a visual image of somebody and create a film and have them do every bit of dialogue and every bit of movement.  Right.  It's all going to, you're not going to need people to do a fucking thing anymore.  But at that point, will people care about movies if it's, if everyone could do it and it's so easy to do?  You know what I'm trying to say?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right now, it's a special experience still. 
[00:08:00]  You go to the movie theater, most of us, or you got a nice system at home and you're like, wow, look at this.  But if you fast forward a bunch of years and people are doing it on their own, how important is movies going to be?  It really is amazing, though, when you think back just a few years and, you know, the technology that's available to people now, wouldn't, you wouldn't dream that you'd be able to do some of the shit that, like, like, whenever they talk about things like green screening and in the earlier days, blue screening and Star Wars, you'd see the special of, and here's the ship and we film it in front of a blue screen. 
[00:08:30]  And now you take this out and move it.  With their dumb little models.  Yeah.  And you'd be like, like, that's a fucking miracle.  And now if you got a fucking Mac at home, you can just do it yourself.  Yeah, look at me.  I'm fucking taking out shit.  I'm compositing stuff.  Yeah, so you could be way better than George Lucas was in the 70s.  What, George Lucas?  You mean the guy that's again selling Star Wars?  No, he's not.  Oh, yes, he is.  What's he doing?  Oh, yes, he is.  Look, we got it in front of hearts.  How many times, in how many different ways, has George Lucas sold Star Wars? 
[00:09:00]  What is this now?  Star Wars, the complete saga.  What's the matter with you?  Blu-ray.  It's Blu-ray.  Again.  It's package-y.  From the first time you were able to buy A New Hope on VHS to this time where you're  able to buy all six movies and a shitload of extras on Blu-ray.  I mean, there's been each individual movie on VHS, then a package. 
[00:09:30]  You forgot the LaserDisc.  LaserDisc.  Of course.  LaserDisc.  I think it started with LaserDisc.  Then the fucking revamped version where he changed a few things around and added some  CGI and then when it came out on DVD.  High def.  And then it just, he has sold the same movie slash movies so many fucking times.  But this, Star Wars, the complete saga, he's still holding back. 
[00:10:00]  So he has one more trick in his pocket.  Does he?  The original movie, as it was seen in movie theaters, he refuses to release.  Right.  This is the one that they, uh, they added in, you know.  You know, cleaned it up.  You know, scrubbed it, uh, scrubbed it clean.  Greedo shoots first?  Yes.  Yeah, fuck.  But I mean, people that give a break.  People that give a shit about collections and what's not, they're patiently waiting for  him to release what it looked like in movie theaters a long time ago. 
[00:10:30]  No?  No.  No.  Because he's too busy adding shit to the old ones.  Ah, yeah.  To re-release the original ones.  The Greedo shoot first thing.  That was when Solo shot him, but they had to make Greedo shoot first so it didn't make  Hanri a bad guy.  Yeah, because Han Solo, of course, was a space fucking pirate smuggling shit.  Why would he shoot someone?  You know, especially a guy that's trying to drag him back, uh, to, uh, Jabba.  Uh, of course he would shoot first.  So he shot him. 
[00:11:00]  Ridiculous.  And then what do they do?  Do they change it?  Yeah.  Yeah, they made it look like Greedo shot first.  It looks all awkward because, because he, Han Solo like moves his head and it doesn't look  natural.  When do they do that?  In the bar scene.  That fucking Clay Elephant  Clay Elephant playing the tuba  No, no, but when do they actually add the  There you go  The shooting  This is the original  Oh, the original  Oh, there is an original 
[00:11:30]  Yeah  Hand shot first  There's one you would like  Yeah  It says George Lucas would like you to forget  They have their little chat  And he says, you know, over at My Dead Body  And he knows he's going to fuck with him  Of course he shoots first  Yes, I remember this  Han's got the gun under the table  And  Oh, wow  This version will be on the official Blu-ray  It will not be on the official Blu-ray  He's sneaking his gun out  Yeah, yeah, he's talking to Greedo 
[00:12:00]  He sneaks his fucking blaster out  And holds it under the table  Because he knows Greedo's going to fuck with him  Why wouldn't he shoot him?  Greedo's not a good guy  Wow  She's from under the table, yeah  Let's talk Jets  Let's talk Jets  Let's talk Jets  Oh, that's your  Oh, sorry, hang on  See, just blast him right there  Right  There you go  So  And what's the new  I don't know what the  The new version looks so dumb  Like a blast just comes out of fucking 
[00:12:30]  Greedo's gun like sideways  Why the fuck do they have to do that?  And then he moves his head all dumb  Why would Lucas be such a whore  That he would allow his vision to be tainted like that?  Same reason Spielberg put walkie-talkies in the hands of the fucking  But he regrets that now  Why does he regret that?  He said he regretted messing with the movie  And in the Blu-ray release of E.T.  It's going back to the original  Didn't he do that because  That's funny  Well, Drew Barrymore  Drew Barrymore wouldn't promote it without 
[00:13:00]  It's a guns or something  Yeah, Drew Barrymore's not into guns  He gives a fuck  Even in movies  That scene where they're running around with their walkie-talkies is so embarrassing  Can we see that?  Because I vaguely, I remember that  But I don't remember what it looked like  But he regrets it  But at the time he had to know it was ridiculous to do  He's talking about other stuff  And how parenthood affected some of his thoughts on previous movies that he's done  Yeah 
[00:13:30]  In Close Encounters of the Third Kind  He says he would never have Richard Dreyfuss get on the ship and leave  Because as a parent  He knows now that that would be nearly impossible to do as a father  Because he has, you know, three kids  To then get into the ship and leave  And leave your, you know, your wife that maybe you had trouble with there  But then the three kids, he just fucking didn't even think twice  He got on the ship and fucking took off  But Dreyfuss was kind of in a trance 
[00:14:00]  So that would be possible  Yeah, but he says, nah, like knowing what he knows now as a dad  He would never do that  It's a movie  Yeah, I know  Stop overthinking real life into movies  That's what I thunk  So dumb  I've never seen the new  Although I'll say this  I honestly go back sometimes  I look at certain things I've written  Yeah  Never things I've said  A couple things I've said  And I look back at them and I'm like  I don't want to take them back  I don't feel like I'm terrible  But it's like anything else in life 
[00:14:30]  You can look back and go  Obese primate?  That's what I wish I had developed into a 13 episode series  Obese primate  I think you're about to say everyone thinks  But then to go back and try to clean it up is ridiculous  You can't  It's just silly  You gotta just leave it  Just let it be, man  You gotta leave it  I've never seen the new ones  I've literally  You've never seen the new Star Wars movies?  Never seen the new three  No?  No  The first one's a kid movie  Of course it is  So is the fucking third Return of the Jedi 
[00:15:00]  Yeah  Yeah, they're alright  I wasn't blown away by it  I'll tell you one thing  The lightsaber fight  With the Sith Lord there was pretty fucking cool  That was a good one  I'll watch them  I have a lightsaber fight  I'm gonna bring this home  Liam Neeson gets his comeuppance  Oh, don't tell me  Well  Well, it happens  Comeuppance  Oh  Could it be anything?  Could it be  They give him new soy sauce  For his hair  He's gonna wash his uppance off of something 
[00:15:30]  I cannot watch him  I didn't miss Chip  That's for sure  I miss Jimmy though  Fuck  Fuck  I cannot watch Liam Neeson  In anything now  Without thinking of his soy sauce dyed hair  It's terrible  And it's just the fact that now he's  He's like this  Every story seems to be the mild-mannered guy  And he's put in a situation where he's gotta kick some ass  There's that new one that's out  Where he got like in an accident  And he's got kind of amnesia 
[00:16:00]  Of course he does  And then he comes out of amnesia  And then thoughts start coming back to him  And he's gotta kick people's asses  Because they're trying to kill him  Yeah  Liam Neeson  Let me tell you something  I like him as an actor  Schindler's List is a fucking work of art  Of course it is  Yeah  But Taken  I will convince everybody eventually  That that movie is a piece of shit  That's a bomb-a-rooney  What a terrible film  Unknown  That was the one he's in now  I didn't buy the kids in Taken 
[00:16:30]  But I love the action  I love the action  Did you like the fact that when him and his dumb CIA buddies are sitting talking  Well that was kind of stupid too  Yeah about the old days  The barbecue at the barbecue  Yeah  God who gave a shit  Remember Da Nang when we  Really  I think the problem people have with that movie is  The action scenes were so good  That you just still want to buy into it  There was some horrible dialogue  Terrible  Horrible  And you know  Casting the daughter's friend 
[00:17:00]  Like no one was believing that she was an innocent girl  Oh god no  And the daughter wasn't innocent  Yeah the daughter's all like  Daddy  The dumb run  But you can tell she's in her 20s  And she's fucking going  Playing young  She's going to Europe  With what amounts to probably one of the sluttiest fucking girls  In screen history  When she runs  That fucking lunkhead run  We should play lunkhead music  Do you know how many people I've ruined the movie for  Who say they can't watch it  Without seeing her run 
[00:17:30]  Dad  That lunkhead  With her balled up fists  And she's running  That stupid fucking pony  What did he get her  Like a little sing microphone  Oh god  He got it like a Mr. Microphone  Fucking  Yeah  Look at this  It's great isn't it  Don't you like this  A pony  And he's just like  Fuck  But the action scenes were amazing  I don't even remember them  That's the problem  I like that  Yeah  Hey  Blasted that guy's wife  That was kind of cool  Oh yeah he shot her a couple times  Usually they don't do that in movies  Shot her  That was good 
[00:18:00]  We should uh  Well I don't know  We should talk about the Emmys  For like two minutes maybe  I didn't watch  You didn't miss anything  I was trying to watch  And tweak the thing  And there was nothing there man  It was just a bore fest  Everything felt flat  There wasn't a laugh to be had  Except for Ricky Gervais  And then  Jane Lynch  That  How to take a shot at Ricky Gervais  Jane Lynch  I know a lot of people adore that woman  She's cunty man  I didn't know who she was  She is cunty 
[00:18:30]  And not likable  In my opinion  She's in Glee  I don't know  A show I don't watch  But it seems  Seems to do pretty well  Yeah and I never watched  Two and a Half Men  Which I heard she was on  No I know she was in  Best in Show and all that  So she's  You know there's a lot of people  That like her for that reason  But as a person  She comes across a big  Do we have the moment  With Ricky Gervais  Oh yeah we got that  So Louis C.K. did not win  So I got nominated  For four things though right  Yeah they gave it to  Modern Family  He didn't win anything right 
[00:19:00]  Cause then I finally  I finally bailed  With the  I don't know  Four hours left in the show  Oh god right  I bailed  Not that nice  A lot of  A lot of wins  For Modern Family  A show I don't really watch  We had one guy in here though  He was pretty cool  We had a couple right  No or just one  I don't know  Have we  Yeah  We forget we have people in  We realize we're ragging them  And then people are like  Hey  Remember you had them on the show  And you liked them  I was like oh that's right  We had the chubby gay  Who's not gay in real life  Right 
[00:19:30]  Eric something  I mean like when we were  Talking about the  Okay  The singer that we had  From like fucking  Oh Foreigner  Foreigner  And we were like yeah  We were playing some  Some Foreigner  With the new singer  And we're like yeah  He sounds good  But you know  It's not the real band  It's not this  And then people realized  And started writing in  Going hey idiots  You had him on your show  You talked to him  You liked him  You know how many times  That happens  A lot  We end up doing the same bit  Almost word for word  Yeah 
[00:20:00]  And at the time  We don't realize that  And people are yelling  On the screen  You did this already  And then we're making fun  The new singer  Foreigner  I had no idea  That we had him  On the phone  That we had him  On the phone  Kelly's everything right  Yeah a few years ago  You Ramoned him  Oh he got Ramoned badly  We played the Ramoning  The Ramoning  It was very funny  We uh  Actually I was listening  We were talking about  Also the other day  Journey  And the new singer  For Journey  Who now isn't really  A new singer  Who's been with him  For quite a while  The Polynesian looking guy 
[00:20:30]  But do you realize  That there's a drummer  In Journey  Casnova  Dean  Yeah  And I guess he played  With Ozzy also  And I think he was on  Was it Blizzard of Oz  Or something  He's been around man  He's been around for a while  Trying to do his own thing  For a long time  Dude there is a version  Of Mother Father  Journey song  That he sings  Yeah  That blows the fucking  New singer away  I know  Like it's  Ridiculously sounds  Exactly 
[00:21:00]  If not  Better than Steve Perry  I saw that  You tweeted that  The problem is  That's not uh  And people are gonna  Yell at me for this  But Mother Father  Is not a huge  Journey song  For the masses  Right  That's the problem  If he did that  With like  Open Arms or something  People would be like  Holy shit  It's crazy  How fucking  Don't stop believing  Or whatever  Yeah  Like Steve Perry though  And yeah  He's been around  For like a long time  He's been with the band  I don't know how long  Quite a few  He might be the original  I guess he also played  With Geezer on one of his 
[00:21:30]  Fucking projects  He  When I was at BAB  He was trying to get  A band off the ground  Yeah  I forgot the name  To be honest with you  Obviously it didn't happen  Yeah  It didn't work out  But a really cool guy  And it seems like  He's just been in music  His whole life  Yeah yeah  And to fucking drum  And fucking sing like that  To me it was just like  Holy fuck  We got that  Let's uh  I think so  Yeah yeah  We should play a little of that  All you really gotta do  Is if you Google  Google uh  Or YouTube  Yeah  And then if you want  To talk about the Emmys 
[00:22:00]  Give us a call I guess  YouTube Dean  Fucking mother father  D-E-E-N  Actually  D-E-E-N  Yeah yeah  That's how he spells it  Yeah  I didn't know that  Castronova  Yeah  Yeah and it's uh  Uh  Is this the one  For  She sits  Alone  In my empty  Stay  I'm not in space  She was  Where did she go 
[00:22:30]  Who's like  He's gone  The death  Is broken  Oh  Hey  Father  Father  You're gone  Hey  Come in  Father  You're gone  Oh  Come in  Father  You're gone 
[00:23:00]  You're gone  Amen  Amen  Amen  Yeah  Yeah  That sounds fucking amazing.  Sounds like he's lip-syncing.  It sounds like it, doesn't it?  Here's the question.  Did Steve Perry sing that originally?  Because sometimes bands will do that.  They'll give one of the songs to one of the other guys because he just does a better job with it.  No, Steve Perry definitely did that.  Did that originally?  Originally.  That was a fuck you to Steve Perry.  To a fucking T.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  They have sent so many fuck yous to Steve Perry.  It's like, I'm sure they would not even accept his phone call at this point.  No, man.  It's like, yeah, you know what?  When the singer's taking a break, we'll toss it to the drummer and he'll still sound better than you.  And then we'll get some Filipino kid.  We'll pay him minimum wage.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck your million, Steve Perry.  You stay home.  We're good here.  Right?  Yeah.  Why'd he leave?  Because his fucking ego got too big.  Because he's an asshole. 
[00:24:00]  Pretty much.  I mean, he was trying to do his solo thing with that O-Sher-ee and all that crap.  Yeah, O-Sher-ee.  I call it O-Sher-ee.  O-Sher-ee.  Yeah, it's O-Sher-ee.  You're right.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  I haven't thought about Steve Perry in so long, but I think that's pretty much what happened.  Yeah.  Got a little too big for his britches.  Consensus was that he sucked as a person.  Yeah.  Anyway, yeah.  Very hard to get along with.  Back to the Emmys, I gather.  Ricky Gervais.  Owned at the Emmys?  Well.  It was the Emmys. 
[00:24:30]  Who was saying?  Owned at.  I thought it was owned at.  I thought it was pwned.  So the YouTube clip says Ricky Gervais owned.  Oh, owned the Emmys this year.  I thought it was owned.  Okay.  You scared me.  Because he was the only funny thing in the entire fucking show, I think.  Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel wrestling a little bit.  That was.  You didn't like the Emmy tones?  It was homo.  Homorotic.  I feel so bad for Joel McHale.  I know he's a friend of the show, but why would he agree to that? 
[00:25:00]  Did you see the Emmy tones?  No, I didn't.  Do you have a clip of the Emmy tones?  I can try and find them.  Can you explain the Emmy tones to these guys?  No, I can't.  I can't either.  It was like.  He's got like six B-list actors.  The only one I recognized was Joel McHale.  Will Devaldorama was there.  Okay.  Who's that?  He played Fez on that 70s show.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  He was famous when the 70s show was on.  He's been trying to be famous ever since.  Zachary Levi was there.  I know Zachary.  Yeah, he's great.  Meredith from The Office was the redhead. 
[00:25:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Just saying, Eric.  One of the girls from How I Met Your Mother.  She was in that.  Okay, I don't know that show.  And I forgot who the other chick was.  All right.  And all of a sudden they would sing kind of jingles that kind of made.  Here's the Emmy tones.  Do you want them?  Yeah.  Oh, the Emmy tones.  Joel is fucking pretty famous now, man.  I know.  I don't know why he would say yes to this.  Oh, my.  We used to do them separately.  But we loved them together tonight. 
[00:26:00]  So we wouldn't run long.  Wow, what a smattering of applause that got.  They introduced each category.  So that was their introduction for Variety.  And, yeah. 
[00:26:30]  He must have pissed off Chevy Chaser.  Or something, man.  Why is he doing that?  Is that his punishment?  They're just awful.  Like, they never allow.  Like, Jack Black.  Did he not do a sketch on this one?  No.  Oh, no.  They're never good.  But usually they're fun to watch because you can make fun of it.  This one was really tough to even make fun of.  Just awful, huh?  Yeah, I watched to make fun.  And, man, this was just a dud.  Just sat there.  You know what it is, too?  I don't know what the alternative would be.  But the whole big, gaudy set and the overhead fucking cam view flying in over the crowd. 
[00:27:00]  And we'll be back.  It's like the same shit that was going on in the 50s.  You could punch up and it's exactly the same.  But then they win awards for their version being better than ones that came before them.  And just like you said, yeah, they all look different.  And now, let's welcome.  And they come.  Da-da-da.  The music.  They walk down the stairs.  They come to the fucking podium.  Read some stupid shit.  The fucking award show format has remained unchanged. 
[00:27:30]  Yes.  It is in suspended animation.  I think they should throw the cue cards away.  Make these people that are supposed to be talented.  Go up there and do something.  Go up.  Wing it, motherfucker.  Wing it for 30 seconds.  Why not?  I mean, if you want to use your own writers on the side to maybe try to figure some shit  out, that's cool.  But don't read the shit off the teleprompt anymore.  But they look like me auditioning when they do that stuff.  These are great actors and they can't fucking do a scene in a podium. 
[00:28:00]  They can't do a scene.  No, they stink.  It's terrible.  They all look like amateurs up there when they're trying to work off the other person.  Yeah.  It's fucking...  It's horrible.  Well, Bob, that's what you say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I only say that because as a bull, I raged.  You know, I'm 9-11 here in New York.  All right, Bob.  Why don't we get to the nominees for...  You know what it is?  This is why these award shows are horrible and they used to be great. 
[00:28:30]  I don't think they ever were great, Jimmy.  No, no.  But you would at least look forward to seeing them.  You didn't see a lot of these actors ever outside of their roles or the Johnny Carson show.  Now you could see them melting down and throwing a fucking ashtray through a window on TMZ.  This is boring.  This looks as phony as it is.  Whereas this used to be them letting it all hang out and talk and be themselves.  Oh, man.  When you would see like fucking, you know, and here he comes, Clark Gable, making his way down the carpet.  It would be like a big deal. 
[00:29:00]  I think also there's too many.  Yeah.  Because half these people, they went up to get their awards and I'm like, I don't know this person.  When we were growing up, you know, there was only three, four networks.  It's embarrassing to say.  But every person walking up on that stage is like, holy shit.  He's a major star.  Yeah, there's Archie Bunker.  When he's not being Archie Bunker, that's pretty fucking cool.  Right.  But now you'd see Carol O'Connor in a car yelling at somebody, a crossing guard.  Yeah.  Fucking throwing his Wendy's order out the window going, fucking dropping the N-bomb for real.  Either he was a liberal in real life. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, he was.  And that's why these are just not as like, you don't care anymore about these.  How does a liberal in real life play that role?  I don't get it.  Tremendous parody.  Tremendous mockery.  Yeah, it really was.  That's what it was.  He was mocking.  But he was so believable.  People hated him as a conservative.  And he had to tell people in his real life, no, I'm actually the opposite of this shit.  Yeah, he was amazing.  He was real proud of the role, too.  I mean, because he did such a great job showing how dumb a guy like that could come off. 
[00:30:00]  I guess that's what made it easy for him.  He's like, all right, I'm going to make these people look stupid.  Yeah.  But he has to use himself.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  So, hey, a couple clips from the Emmys.  Why not?  Jane Lynch.  Oh, talks to your favorite person, Ant.  Who's that?  Leonard Nimoy.  To start off the Emmys last night.  Do you know the story behind this?  This is wonderful.  Let's listen to this wonderful exchange.  What's the story?  I have been and always shall be your friend. 
[00:30:30]  Hey, Everdance, your friend.  You ruined.  I didn't know what was wrong with the way he spoke.  And I know we talked about it.  I'm like, it doesn't sound right.  No.  His dentures are too big.  His fucking space dentures.  Live long and prosper.  How old is he in that?  22,000.  He's 22,000 with bad dentures.  Yeah.  That doesn't make sense.  They couldn't fix that.  If a guy could live that long, but they can't figure out the teeth, that's stupid.  I think McCoy would have had something for him. 
[00:31:00]  Hell yeah, man.  Yeah.  What's the story behind this?  He was a last minute replacement for Alec Baldwin, who filmed this entire thing, the whole opening skit,  and then asked for it not to air because they were going to cut his Rupert Murdoch joke about the whole scandal over in the UK.  The email scandal, whatever.  It's aired on Fox.  And to Fox's defense, they didn't want to seem like they were making light of something so serious that they're involved in. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, but he does run, he does own Fox, so.  Good for Alec Baldwin on this one.  So he said, you know, if you cut that joke, it's going to throw off the whole timing of the entire skit that we did,  so I just don't want you to air it at all.  Nice.  So they went and got Leonard Nimoy.  All right, I agree with Alec Baldwin.  So they found Leonard?  I'm a whore, I would have thought of that.  They sure did, and he wasn't doing anything.  They grabbed him off his rocking chair.  Leonard Nimoy is the replacement for Fungie.  Yeah, that's right.  It goes Alec Baldwin, Leonard Nimoy.  All right, this is how it went down. 
[00:32:00]  Listen to how funny Jane Lynch is.  She was just amazing, man.  Just an amazing fucking performer.  Reporting for doing, Mr. President of Television.  Oh, Jane, have a seat.  I'm so glad you're here.  I'm firmly convinced that you have a seat.  Have a seat.  I'm so glad you're here.  He is having such a problem holding those giant choppers in his face.  I was watching this last night, and I'm like, fucking Anthony.  God damn it. 
[00:32:30]  God.  Is there a video of that?  Because I have got to see the video.  Yeah, there it is.  Look how hard it is for him to hold those choppers.  In five more years, we might have a video element to the OPN Anthony show.  So hang tight, kids.  We're working on it.  Yeah.  Another five.  Well, they don't have to ask the lawyers if we can play every clip.  Yeah.  Like, we play this, and we get in trouble.  Have a seat.  This is not good.  His teeth just in his picture.  God bless his giant teeth.  Oh, Jane. 
[00:33:00]  Have a seat.  I'm so glad you're here.  I'm firmly convinced that you are the most logical person to host the Emmys this year.  To men, you're womanish.  To women, you're mannish.  Well, thank you so much.  Manish.  I keep one thing in mind.  Don't ever let them know that we all live together in this one building.  So beautiful.  Oh, hi, Jane.  Hey there.  Oh, brother.  What was all this?  That's pretty much it for his part. 
[00:33:30]  That's it for Leonard Nimoy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's done.  I wasn't sure.  Yeah, not a lot.  That was then at seven minutes of.  Then it's a seven-minute musical montage opening.  Now, what was the Joan with the Fox?  That was actually a pretty line, too.  What did he say?  To men, you're...  Manish.  Women.  I don't know.  To women, you're...  To women, you're mannish.  That was pretty funny.  Or to men, you're mannish or whatever.  That was pretty funny.  What was the Murdoch joke?  Probably something about spying or something?  Yeah, it was an email joke or something.  James T. Kirk. 
[00:34:00]  What's the first part of Jane Lynch's intro song?  Why is that on the desk?  Is it worth playing?  I didn't think she was worth watching at fucking all.  Nothing I remember, so...  All right, let me just see this.  TV is a vast wonderland.  The ironic musical fucking beginnings to these things, the whole, like, you know, let's  fucking do this.  Billy Crystal would always do the big production on the Oscars where he would come out and sing 
[00:34:30]  songs based on the movies and everything.  And it's like, it was kind of a parody of what they used to do.  But he set that in motion because I think he pulled it off for the time.  And then every year since, they...  Yabba, scooby, dabba, da, dee, boobadooba, da.  I hate to say it, but I think the first time he did it, he actually pulled it off.  But the problem was then every year they had to do the same thing.  And now it's just kind of hacking it.  He's one of the better Oscar hosts.  I mean, it's not an easy gig, but Billy Crystal does a good job when he hosts it.  Yeah, yeah.  Who's doing it this year?  Eddie Murphy. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  I think Murphy will be good, I mean.  If they let him be Eddie Murphy, that's the problem with these things.  What an odd choice, though, right?  Like, because he's been doing kids' movies and making a lot of money, but he hasn't been  doing movies that you would think the Oscars would...  Yeah.  Yeah, would nod to.  Which I think is a shame.  I think he should be doing stuff like that.  Like, Murphy's such a talented guy.  I never liked the fact that he didn't do more...  I thought he should have done stuff that people wouldn't have expected, like, prior to Grease  Lightning and Blue Collar.  I thought Murphy should have done a few of those.  Yeah.  He's a good actor, yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Travis, what we got to play for these guys is the house announcer.  People are reminding me.  They tried this bit.  So, like, I don't know, Blah Blah wins the Emmy, right?  Oh, no.  So, as that Blah Blah is walking up onto the stage to get the Emmy, the house announcer's  like, he went to high school at Blah Blah High School, and the mascot was Blah Blah Blah  Blah.  Just horrible.  Yeah, they did that last year, too.  And was it trying to be funny?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it felt horribly flat.  Just coming up with these weird little quirky things that the person's all about with some 
[00:36:00]  comedy being attempted there.  If you got that...  I mean, all I have to do is find a winner.  Because he did one for everyone.  Right.  Oh, he did, huh?  What do you got?  Kate Winslet?  I don't know.  Sure, why not?  Oh, no.  Horrible version.  Look at that.  You don't want to click on a video that has that much red.  Yeah.  Yeah, the house announcer was horrible. 
[00:36:30]  Was it Don Pardo?  I don't know.  I was just saying.  Last year, it was the guy who played PC in those Mac and PC ads.  Oh, the fat guy.  Right?  Yeah.  Not the kid.  And the Emmy goes to Jim Parsons.  Oh, this is so odd for so many reasons.  They cut out the part where he walks up.  The only part we wanted to say.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  That's a lot of red.  That one ain't going to work.  All right, if you find one.  In the meantime, man, Ricky Gervais did a tape piece for the Emmys, and I thought it  did really well.  It was pretty funny.  And then stupid Jane Lynch had a comment about it.  But this is the Ricky Gervais thing quickly.  Do you want to play the video from here?  Oh, you want to do it that way?  I would love to see it because I've not seen it.  I was busy.  Oh, you're going to hate Jane Lynch in about two minutes.  I don't have the Jane Lynch part.  You're going to have to play that.  Okay.  Okay. 
[00:37:30]  Okay, Ricky Gervais.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hello.  Um, firstly, sorry I can't be there live in person.  Not allowed.  Not after the Golden Globes.  Not allowed.  In fact, now, during any award ceremony, I'm not even allowed on American soil.  That's why.  This is pre-recorded.  Um, and the Emmy bosses have warned me if I say anything rude or controversial, they 
[00:38:00]  will edit it out, and, uh, you won't know the difference.  What a bunch of cowardly countrymen, like Simon Cowell and Piers Morgan.  We're proud of you.  I've won a few Emmys myself.  I've lost a few, too.  I was up for five last year, and I lost them all to other shows that, in my opinion, were  absolute Schindler's List.  But then went on to do TV with Band of Brothers and The Pacific for HBO, which, in my opinion,  is the greatest channel in the world. 
[00:38:30]  Apart from Fox, that is, obviously.  Anyway, I've been running on for about ten minutes.  Cutting them apart.  I hope I didn't say anything that you found offensive.  Although, if I did, I don't care.  You can suck my Twinkie.  Thanks for listening.  And finally, thanks to God for making me an absolute idiot.  There.  I've said it.  Again.  Let's have a look at the nominations.  That's well done.  That's very funny.  That's well done. 
[00:39:00]  Funny.  Yeah.  They got a cunt joke in right at the beginning.  Oh, my God, yeah.  That was a cunt joke, for the love of God.  Yeah, and the best part, you were laughing over, he goes, I've been rambling on here  for ten minutes.  Yeah, for ten minutes.  It's only a minute thirty, the whole piece.  Oh, that's funny.  Then Jane Lynch had to say this.  She just had to.  Oh, poor little Ricky Gervais.  Someone didn't get enough hugs from Mommy, and somehow it's Hollywood's fault.  And the Emmy goes to.  I don't think she was going for a joke there, man. 
[00:39:30]  I really don't.  Yeah, because I wouldn't get the joke anyway.  Like, what does that mean?  But it's like, he was.  It was funny.  Yeah, I don't understand what she was going for there, because he was really funny and  mocking what happened to him.  Yeah.  And he is, maybe he's bash heard of shows before, but I don't know.  But the bottom line is, it was fucking, they have, they literally, they think they have,  they're so insulated.  They have a very, their sense of humor about themselves is one that they can all agree 
[00:40:00]  on and wink on.  Like, you can't make fun of them from the outside, or they get bothered by it.  Or if you're seen as to be making fun of them in a way they don't deem appropriate, they  get upset by it.  Yeah.  They're all awful.  The actors, that's why I have a real dislike, as much as I'm a celebrity begging photo whore,  I hate most actors.  Yeah.  I hate them.  I hate.  Well, Charlie Sheen, he went up there, and people were like, oh God, what is Charlie  going to say on live TV?  Oh, because he's crazy.  Oh my God, you've got two and a half men starting up with Ashton Kutcher, and here's  Charlie Sheen, and they bumped into each other backstage, oh my God, was there going to be 
[00:40:30]  a fist fight, blah, blah, blah.  And then this is what Charlie did on stage.  Thank you.  Good evening.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Before I present Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, my old category, I want to 
[00:41:00]  take a moment to get something off my chest and say a few words to everybody here from  Two and a Half Men.  From the bottom of my heart, I wish you nothing but the best for this upcoming season.  Queen Magnanimous, I think that's called, right?  We spent eight wonderful years together. 
[00:41:30]  And I know you will continue to make great television.  Now on to the Emmy.  The nominees for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.  Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.  Jonathan said after his roast, which I didn't see, of course, but it's on to what I mean, but  I didn't.  You didn't see it from the stage, that's for sure.  Why would I?  No.  Jim, they're big fans. 
[00:42:00]  Shut up!  They're not!  But no, I heard Jonathan said that he looks very employable.  That was what Jonathan said at the end of the thing.  He watched it, he goes, he's employable.  At the roast, he seemed employable.  He didn't do anything crazy.  Right.  That's what he's doing right now.  He cleaned himself up.  He needs a fucking gig.  He realized how much he hurt himself, right?  Yeah.  Because that wasn't even funny, like the Emmy apology, that was an apology in front of the  entire world.  Right.  And there was nothing funny about it.  He was just like, that was his momentary mea culpa.  Are you buying into it, or is that something he figures, I better say this? 
[00:42:30]  It's a PR move.  The way he said it, I feel like he's like...  Where's the crazy internet Charlie Sheen with the wacky hair and fucking, you know, the  camera up his nostrils, talking about tiger blood and all that shit.  He's like, no, I need a job, motherfucker.  Yeah, this is the real Charlie right there.  Yeah.  The other thing was just kind of like this...  A work.  This dopey wizard character.  Wizard.  Why are we showing this?  Because there's a...  I have a really funny line from the house announcer. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, good.  Oh.  Well, thank you for stopping on this, because I want to ask Ant's opinion about a black  Charlie's Angel.  They're rebooting.  Yeah, yeah.  Charlie's Angel.  Charlie's Angel is going to be on TV now, right?  Yeah.  So it's going to be back on TV, but they had to go with a black angel.  Does she say lines like, you want to arrest, sugar?  Oh.  Yeah?  We could find a trailer, maybe.  I hope so.  I don't think she's playing it that black.  Who is the...  She's playing it like she's white, but she looks black. 
[00:43:30]  White black?  That type of black.  Who's the short one that doesn't fit?  That's Drew Barrymore.  Oh.  Yeah, she's basically passing the torch.  Yeah.  Oh, is she?  Uh-huh.  Maybe she should pass on dessert.  She looks frumpy next to those new Charlie's Angels.  And the one on the left is what Derek Jeter's banging.  Is that Manky Kelly?  Not anymore.  Oh, it was, yeah.  Oh, right.  It was.  Sorry.  You're right.  Him and Manky Kelly?  About two, three weeks ago.  Yeah.  Why do I care?  Listen, listen. 
[00:44:00]  Fuck, I just caught myself.  What a gossipy fryer.  Oh, you felt bad for Derek Jeter.  No, I didn't care.  It's just...  It's like I thought they're getting married.  You want more tea?  Oh, God almighty.  Oh, they broke up.  Let's drink tea and gossip.  I'm surprised I didn't close my robe and say that.  Oh, did you hear what happened?  God, that was a momentary look into what a pussy I really am.  And why are they going with the Black Charlie's Angel?  Because, you know, that's not what the original show was all about.  It opens up the demo for black people that are usually watching everything on the WB. 
[00:44:30]  Well, my concern is the black is taking over for the ginger.  Because usually when you've got three girls, you get the brunette and the blonde, and then you throw a little ginger in there, a little redhead.  But now they're blowing off the redhead and moving the black in.  How did they start it?  You know, once upon a time, there were three little girls that ended up going to the police academy.  Well, two of them did. 
[00:45:00]  The other one was arrested by the two.  Jesus, Andy.  Yeah, yes.  Two of them got the proper scores, and then one had to be.  Yes.  The other one they had to lower the scores for.  Thank God for affirmative action.  Yeah.  Charlie has to.  Is this a trailer for it?  I don't remember this music.  Yeah.  I remember jacking off to this music.  I mean, watching the show to this music.  John Forsythe is Charlie.  Yes.  I like them so much better in fucking.  Angels.  And Justice for All. 
[00:45:30]  Hang them in for armed robbery, Arthur.  Oh.  All right, let's go back to the house.  I bet not a lot of gunplay in this, right?  Of course not.  I bet there's a lot of, you know, trickery in.  Yeah.  What's not?  Well, they do the kung fu thing instead of guns.  That's acceptable, I guess.  William Friedkin ripped Hollywood recently on the fuck because of what they're doing with  stuff like this and the comic book movies and it's all re-  Yeah.  Everything is a fucking remake.  Reboot.  These, this new Spider-Man, it's like they just did Spider-Man a decade ago. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  And these uncreative fucking creeps are doing it again.  Yeah.  They just keep rebooting shit.  Straw dogs?  Get the fuck out of here.  Point Break.  They want to redo Point Break?  Yeah.  That just came out on the weekend.  Yeah.  A lot of people.  They're terrible.  Are they, are they making a black character in there too?  I don't know.  Yeah.  But can I ask you something now?  Batman, it was obvious they needed a reboot.  It was pretty obvious.  It looked really dated when you started watching those old Batman movies, right? 
[00:46:30]  Uh-huh.  Spider-Man, I don't really see where the problem was.  That seemed like it was still kind of dark, cartoony, and it, it, it, it fit the times.  I guess Peter Parker was getting a little old, huh?  Yeah.  Maybe that's it.  I think Spider-Man 3 failed so terribly.  Yeah.  That they had to reboot it.  Which one was that?  Stop, reboot is not a real movie term.  Well, it's, it's just rehash.  They don't want to say rehash.  It's rehash.  Rehash, yes.  What was Spider-Man 3 about again?  I didn't see it.  That was the one with them.  Sandman, I think? 
[00:47:00]  Is that the one with all the arms?  We had Thomas Hayden Church on promoting that movie.  Yes, of course we did.  Yeah, but he's cool.  He's, he's good in everything he does.  I liked it a lot.  Yeah, I like him as an actor.  Who was the villain though?  The guy with all the arms?  Was that the one?  No, Dr. Ockman was the first one.  That was the, oh, okay.  Was that one or two?  One or two, I don't know.  I think that was two.  Oh, Hayden Church was the villain.  The first, oh, I gotcha, yeah, yeah.  The first one was Willem Dafoe.  Oh, yeah.  That was the Green Goblin.  Oh, right.  They're redoing that.  Ugh, they're the fucking worst.  Oh, okay, okay, this ties in with what Friedkin said. 
[00:47:30]  It's a little long, Jesus.  Tarder and harder to do, and by the way, if anyone doesn't know,  William Friedkin directed The Exorcist and he directed The French Connection.  He's, fuck, he's amazing.  Tarder and harder to do original adult material in this climate of American  film, which is mostly concerned with movies that are comic books and remakes.  The audiences have changed.  They're conditioned by television, and television is aimed at the lowest common  denominator.  Their expectations are lower.  And he said, also, the studios, when I started directing, were run by people  who had made films. 
[00:48:00]  Today, they're former agents or lawyers, and the studios are owned by gigantic  corporations that have to appeal to the lowest common denominator.  But to me, the most important thing he said there was their former agents and lawyers.  And people, I tweeted how great it was, and these fucking assholes on Twitter read  this and go, he's just a bitter old man!  He directed The Exorcist, you dumb motherfucker!  What he said was right about the lawyers.  What are you talking about?  He kind of knows.  He's 100% right. 
[00:48:30]  Right, he's been around.  He kind of knows what film could be.  Right.  Yeah.  From first-hand experience.  Yeah, he fucking changed movies.  All you horror film dorks that were, he thanked him.  He's the guy.  He's the guy.  Oh, man.  That is really telling right there.  That one-third paragraph is fucking, I don't care about the comic book stuff.  That's the important part.  Agents and lawyers.  I think you should have to take an IQ test before you join Twitter. 
[00:49:00]  Just to keep some of the dummies...  My contract's up here at Maya.  Yeah.  People say some dumb shit on Twitter, man.  But when I Twitter how great it was what he said.  Yeah.  And they're like, but he's just a bitter old man.  He's not a bitter old man, you dummy.  He's right with what he's saying.  What, do you think he doesn't get comic books?  He made the girl vomit pea soup.  He gets it.  Shitheads.  All right, well, here's the house announcer.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:49:30]  So, every time someone won an award, the house announcer just babbled about...  Oh, great.  This is for Kyle Chandler, who won the best actor in a drama.  All right, let's hear this.  And the Emmy goes to...  Kyle Chandler!  And it's Coach Taylor for the win.  This is Kyle's third nomination in first inning.  If I were Kyle Chandler every morning, I'd give myself a pep talk in the mirror.  One game at a time. 
[00:50:00]  One day at a time.  Then I'd make coffee.  What the fuck was that even supposed to be?  I'll tell you what that is.  That's the same dummies running television who think that you need constant noise.  They're the same people that think you need constant noise in the fucking Yankee games.  Yeah.  Or the football game.  Yeah, let's go!  Bah, bah!  Let's go!  Bah, bah!  Basehead!  Bah, bah!  Hot dog!  Bah, bah!  Bah, bah!  Noise, noise, noise, noise, noise, noise.  Constant noise!  Why are people so uptight that you can't just relax for a minute and just kind of enjoy 
[00:50:30]  the moment?  It always has to be noise.  Because they're constantly trying to compete with computers and they're doing it wrong again  where they're thinking that there's instant gratification and people won't sit through  the applause.  Yeah.  Hey, we've got all that time now.  We can say something funny.  What can we do with this three seconds right here?  It's constant fucking...  The guy steps out of the fucking batter's box for a second and knocks dirt out of his cleats.  That, let's go!  Bah, bah!  Hold the map map! 
[00:51:00]  Holy shit, shut up!  Just relax a moment.  How much entertainment value do you need for your dollar?  Entertainment value.  It's non-stop.  And he calls for time.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Let's go!  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Let's go!  All right!  You're forgetting a lot of stuff though, Jimmy.  This is a terrific bit, but you're forgetting the lasers and the...  The new graphics coming in and the noise.  Oh, I don't watch it. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Oh, it bugs me.  How are the Yankees doing?  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Are your Yankees falling apart at the end here?  Are they hanging in there?  Where are we at?  Yeah, they're hanging in.  Yeah.  They've got it.  They got it?  They're fine.  Well, they're four and a half up.  Four and a half up.  The Red Sox are the ones that are falling apart.  Yeah, what's the deal with the Sox?  How far ahead are they?  Two games now.  Two games up for the wild card spot.  They lost three out of four to Tampa this year.  Yeah, yeah.  See, I knew the Rays were going to... 
[00:52:00]  They're falling apart.  The lasers and stuff is more football.  That's what they do when they're...  Like, when there's a fucking...  When they have a moment, like a guy calls for a 30-second timeout.  Yeah.  That's when the Fox monster truck comes out.  You know, like, the Fox monster truck comes out.  Nobody has ever laughed at that.  Well, now we have.  The monster truck.  Now we have.  That fucking dancing robot.  I literally will look up and to the right away from it.  It's not funny.  Look, there he is.  There he goes. 
[00:52:30]  There he goes.  Best Buy.  HD.  Guy noises.  Graphics.  Guy noises.  Crash.  Loud.  It runs.  It jumps.  It runs in place.  It shakes its legs off.  What is it supposed to be?  It's a futuristic...  It makes no sense.  It's a guy toy.  Is it their mascot for Fox?  Yeah, for years.  It's a guy thing.  Guy noises.  Yeah, robot.  Wow, I didn't even realize it was their mascot.  An NFL robot for Christmas.  I fucking hate...  Oh, you get an action figure? 
[00:53:00]  Because it's here at Fox when they're doing, like, get on the land, land, land.  What's that music?  That music they do for Fox.  Yeah, that football type of music.  And then the robot comes in.  He does, like, a little funny dance on the corner.  Who the fuck wants a metal football robot guy dancing?  You don't like that, Jim?  Put anything there.  Put anything but that.  You don't find it funny?  No.  But besides that, they pop the graphics off.  The camera's got to be moving.  Everything is just fucking moving.  It's just always...  Always!  ...perpetual motion.  Because we think we're sharks now, and if we sit still for a half a second, the TV is 
[00:53:30]  just going to die and turn off.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck, you're right.  Are you going to like the little metal thing that opens up?  Shhh, shhh, shhh, with stats in there.  Guy noises.  Because guys like laser.  And guys like metal noises.  Yes.  Clang!  Oh, guys will like that.  No, we won't.  Yeah, you watch an old football clip, and it's almost uncomfortable how there's nothing  going on.  Nothing's going on.  There's no ads.  There's nothing. 
[00:54:00]  Watch a guy stretch out his hammy on the sidelines for 30 seconds with nothing going on.  I was watching an old baseball game on ESPN Classic, and not one ad was on the side  of the friggin', you know, now there's an ad everywhere, superimposed.  Everything is an ad.  Yeah, everything is fucking sponsored.  But, yeah, the old days, it was just guys playing baseball.  And the announcer, they pretty much wouldn't say shit unless the play was on.  Sometimes they'd banter back and forth, it's like, yeah, I took the wife out to the steakhouse 
[00:54:30]  last night, it was a good time, that went high and wide for ball two, and that was it.  You mean the fucking on-deck circle wasn't sponsored by Jeep Cherokee?  Or this fucking, this knocking the dirt out of the cleats is sponsored by, who sponsors  that?  They've got a list of sponsors now, that they have to run through the announcers.  It's unlistenable.  It really gets ridiculous.  It's unlistenable.  Oh, the Nikon post-game report, sponsored by Nikon.  If I was an advertiser, I would never advertise on that shit.  What happens on this? 
[00:55:00]  You blend in with everybody else.  This is just, this is the Fox NFL intro.  Okay, this is the intro.  This is a good one.  All right.  Why?  The robot falls out of the field.  Bunch of robots playing as electricity.  They're hitting each other.  As an intro, it's like, all right, it's an intro.  So, robots are playing each other.  I would watch robot football like that.  I don't know.  Looks like they're kicking ass.  An intro is an intro.  I don't mind that. 
[00:55:30]  Right.  I mean, it looked cool as all hell, to be honest with you.  But when he's dancing, that's silly.  Yeah, when he's dancing on the side of the screen, because there's a dumb 30-second time  out, like Jimmy was saying.  Then it's obnoxious.  The intro is like, kind of gets you pumped.  They have to do something during the intro.  But it's like, it's the graphics in the corner, and it's when it's the constant need for stimulation.  Yes.  It is the absolute constant need for guy noises.  Guy noises.  It's guy things. 
[00:56:00]  You know, the contrast would be...  Now it's time for football.  Trying to find one from like 10, 15 years ago to see how they...  I don't know if you can.  I mean, even go back to the 80s or more than the 90s if you can. 
[00:56:30]  The music probably just starts on, ba-da-da-da, here's football.  Pretty much.  I was just watching one from 1997, and it's just like, hey, we're going to play some football.  Is this it?  Yeah.  So this is what?  This is 15 years ago?  Almost 15 years.  Now it's real clips of football players.  Yes, sir.  Today you'll get all the gridiron and diamond wards all day.  Horrible graphics.  Right here on Fox.  First, football, and the biggest skirmish of the year.  Skirmish? 
[00:57:00]  It's real people.  No robots.  And by the way, the game meant nothing.  Now that we're in the future.  Yeah.  Football on Pluto.  Okay, maybe so.  This guy stinks, too.  I like the robots.  Skirmish.  Who the fuck says skirmish in the intro?  That's going to annoy me all day.  But at least it's NFL highlights in the intro instead of robots.  Just the announcer should be fucking beheaded.  That doesn't really look that dated.  No.  That's from 97.  The real hullabaloo to be settled today.  Yeah.  Thanks, awful.  Look at the bad fucking. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, it's terrible.  The bad attempts at CGI are really fun.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, 97.  Fuck.  Hey, let's say hi to Matt in D.C.  Matt.  Going with the sponsorship thing.  Matt.  Morning, guys.  Hey, man.  Welcome aboard, Matt.  Hello.  I went to the Redskins game yesterday, and first off, the first advertisement you see  is that you're actually walking into an advertisement, the stadium itself.  Yep.  And then their private sponsors cracks me up. 
[00:58:00]  The Redskins are private sponsor, who I can't remember the name of the company, that  provides them their porta-potties in the parking lots.  Probably show that big banner.  And I love when a team will show who their official moving company is.  I don't want to see my team have a fucking moving company because I want them to stay.  Right, right.  Yeah, exactly.  Moving means, you know, they're leaving town.  I don't care who the official whatever for the team is.  I don't give a fuck.  You forget that stadiums used to have cool names, too.  Now they just, like, sound like shit.  Yeah, but you know what?  You complain about that, but then what's the alternative? 
[00:58:30]  Taxpayers have to pay for all this crap, and they've got to raise ticket prices because  they can't make, you know, enough money.  So...  The city field is a good field for the bad...  But these corporations are so pompous, they think the name of their company sounds cool,  and it just doesn't.  Oh, I don't think any stadium sounds, you know...  Yeah, but they don't realize how awful it sounds.  I'll tell you, how about Yankee fucking stadium?  Well, there's a few that can still, you know, do that.  How about Yankee Stadium?  They would change that, but they know they can't.  That's one that they want to know. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, it's so classic.  It would just be embarrassing.  They'll change it eventually.  It's the house next to the house that Ruth built.  They will change it eventually.  But if the Yankees have a bunch of years that are bad, you watch them change the name of  that fucking stadium.  You guys have Yankee Stadium, which sounds pretty cool.  We have FedEx Steel, which, I mean, is fucking retarded anyways.  But if you just...  I don't know how it is in other cities, but I don't know if it's just Dan Snyder, who's  an absolute Jew whore and sells everything.  But, yeah, the Redskins even have, like, the official pizza.  It's Papa John's, the official chicken of the Redskins, which I find hilarious. 
[00:59:30]  It's healthy.  99% of the team is black anyways.  It's Popeye's.  So they just sell absolutely everything.  Yeah, they all do.  And, you know, it's funny.  I was just thinking, as you're talking, it used to be the Meadowlands were Brendan Byrne  Arena at one point.  So I guess they got to name it after something.  They're going to name it after a governor or whoever Brendan Byrne was.  They'd probably make money and name it after...  Well, now the Jets and Giants play at MetLife Stadium.  That's cool.  Why don't they give the Jets their own stadium?  That annoys me so much. 
[01:00:00]  That is their own stadium.  Two years old, yeah.  That's their stadium half the time.  Yeah.  But it's called Giant Stadium.  No, it's called MetLife Stadium.  Not anymore.  It's still Giant Stadium.  Well, there's a brand new stadium, though.  So it makes it easier for the Jets to feel like it's their home, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Meaning, does everything split Jets and Giants?  Oh, yeah.  In the old Giant Stadium, it was...  The Jets were playing at Giant Stadium, but now it's kind of like...  It was obvious.  Yeah.  So the only cool area I've ever seen was when Jack Ken Cook first, when he had the Redskins  before he died, and Dan Snyder bought it, was he moved the Redskins out of D.C. and 
[01:00:30]  into Lando or Maryland.  But he bought a massive plot of land, and he said, screw you guys.  I'm naming the...  He named...  He made up a town and called it Raujon, Maryland, until the state said, you can't just make up  your own city.  And he said, fuck you.  I'm calling this place Raujon.  So that was the only cool part about the Redskins.  Candlestick, Lambeau.  Created their own...  Yeah, they sound cool, you know.  They're still there, right?  Yeah, right on, brother.  Yeah, Candlestick is still Candlestick Park.  Lambeau Field is still Lambeau Field.  I don't think they've... 
[01:01:00]  Superdome in New Orleans.  Yeah.  It's just...  Cowboy Stadium.  It's just fucked up that New York has two football teams playing in the same fucking  place.  Three, Opie.  You keep forgetting about the Bills.  They are indeed a New York team.  And the Bills looked great yesterday.  They had an amazing second half.  I was talking to Wheeze yesterday.  He thinks the Bills are for real this year.  I don't know enough about the Bills and what they did with the team to know.  But they're off to a...  That is a bold statement.  Yeah.  They're considering their past.  They've had a rough fucking run there. 
[01:01:30]  But they're 2-0, man.  Jets 2-0.  Bills 2-0.  Patriots 2-0.  Colts 0-2.  Don't come down to a field goal.  Where are the Cowboys these days?  1-1.  1-1?  I don't care, though.  I don't care if they go 15-1.  Robins still sucks.  Fucking Brady threw for another 400 and...  What was it yesterday?  20?  24 yards?  23 yards?  He's a madman.  He has over 900 passing yards in the first two fucking games.  940.  940.  Most ever.  Wow.  In the first two games.  Really?  That's un-fucking-believable. 
[01:02:00]  Yep.  Doesn't say much about the running game.  Negative sports guy.  Doesn't say a whole lot about the running game.  Well, you can give that one to the offensive linemen.  That doesn't say much about their running game at all.  Tom Brady's got to throw that much.  It blows his arm out by the fifth game.  You can talk about the passing all you want, but...  Negative football guy.  Yeah, you know, whatever.  Just showing holes in the offense.  I love it.  Exactly.  Dan Marino had a lot of passing yards, too.  I didn't see him win the Super Bowls.  You win the Super Bowls, you've got to deal with defense and a good running game.  You can't control the clock running passes like that. 
[01:02:30]  You can't control the clock running passes like that.  You throw the ball, you drop it, and the clock stops.  You don't like sports talk?  I don't mind it.  It's taking over the world, Jimmy.  I really don't mind it, but the fact that it's on FM, everybody should just take your  fucking boot heel and kick your car radio in.  The fact that your FM stations are sports talk, you should just kick your fucking radio in.  But I don't mind.  You know, sports talk is harmless.  People like to hear it.  I used to like to listen to Beningo, and we were off the air. 
[01:03:00]  So I can enjoy sports talk.  To a point.  Yeah.  Here's what I care about.  Sports talk should be a part-time format.  Or when the guy should.  Because if they have too much time to fill up.  I'm not even joking.  Too much time to fill up, so they have to get into all this nonsense.  Each show should be 40 minutes long.  They should all be fans, too.  Because that, to me, is what I'm interested in hearing, is guys talk passionately about  their teams.  I don't want to hear just a fucking bland know-it-all who has to give the same emphasis to the Jets  that he does to the Niners. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, you can't show any extra passion for a team.  Beningo would-  Nice to get out of the Mad Dog.  Then he can talk about the Giants.  My team, the Giants.  I'm out of California.  But doesn't that show you how unimportant fucking they are?  Because he was the best part of that dumb show, and the ratings are just as good now  without him.  Yeah.  There's nothing to do with him.  And he was great.  I think the ratings are, yeah, right where they were.  Right where they were.  It's literally like leaving fucking noise on.  It doesn't matter who it is.  The callers, I think that they should, you know, they're pitching. 
[01:04:00]  If they don't get pitching, what's going to happen?  Why don't you tell me?  Asshole.  Fucking terrible.  Ah, shit.  Fucking-  That's really funny.  It drives me nuts.  Let me go to Philly and say hi to Joe.  Joe?  What do you say, Joe?  Hello, Joe.  I was just mentioning to the guy that passed the phone.  There was actually an experiment that I think NBC tried.  And I think they only did it once.  They were going to do this thing where they showed football games without any commentating. 
[01:04:30]  Nothing.  It was like watching high school football on cable access.  Well, that's just stupid.  We're not saying to do that, but you can calm it down a little bit.  Get rid of half those sponsorships that no one listens to anymore because there's too many.  I love Madden and, oh my God, Pat Summerall.  I love those guys.  They're a big part of the game.  Fuck yeah.  A lot of the guys, they really, really call a good game.  Deardorff was okay, right?  Yeah, it's all the shit they have to do in between the plays that we could do without.  Well, it only lasted one week. 
[01:05:00]  Speaking of how you guys are saying New York has all these football teams,  how about Cal Los Angeles, the city can't sustain one football team?  Yeah, what is that about, do you think?  I don't understand that.  A lot of L.A. people are transplants, like Florida.  They're from, I think a lot of people go to L.A. to make it.  And for some reason, loyalty is just not there for a football team.  I don't know why.  The Dodgers are loved, but I don't know why they've never been able to have a football team just stick.  Yeah, but you can look at the Clippers.  I mean, the Clippers.  Yeah, that's true.  That's a good point. 
[01:05:30]  I don't know.  That's my only theory.  I'm just guessing.  Wasn't there a time, though, where people were into, like, the Rams?  Yeah.  I can't remember.  Sort of.  I mean, fucking 70s.  I think it's just tough to sit in a stadium when it's 100 degrees.  Is that it?  When you could be at the beach or something.  Unless your team's doing really well.  I think baseball has that curse at times, right?  Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah, what?  Like, Florida has a hard time with baseball.  Don't they?  Yeah, because people want to be doing all this shit when it's so nice out.  Well, the Marlins also had a Super Bowl winning World Series. 
[01:06:00]  I'm going to guess it was 97 or something.  And the fucking asshole, Charles Johnson, was the catch.  He gutted the team.  And they just dismantled the team.  And that was that.  That was a dumb business move because, at the very least, let the team, you know, have the year after the World Series for people to just enjoy it.  97.  That was the dumbest thing ever.  Because then people went to the game and go, holy shit, where are the guys we love?  Who's that guy?  Yeah.  Really, really dumb move. 
[01:06:30]  It was stupid.  Look, we're doing sports radio.  Yeah, we are.  But at least we're doing it like cool guys going, that was fucking stupid.  Ah, he should be killed.  I hope he shatters his shin.  I mean, this question comes up every year, Chris, this time around.  I'll have an answer for it.  Why does Jimmy like the Cowboys?  Real answer, sir.  Real answer, I don't know.  Why you start rooting for a team you don't know?  Like, what makes you...  I thought you knew.  No, no.  My earliest memories of Cowboys, and this is my theory as to why I think I like the Cowboys. 
[01:07:00]  My earliest Dallas Cowboy memories are the Pittsburgh Steelers' Super Bowl loss in Super Bowl XIII.  They lost 35-31.  And I think it was...  I literally think that...  I know that I was very new to football then, because I didn't understand why Bradshaw was taking a knee at the end.  I didn't understand.  Oh, yeah, you didn't get that.  So I had been watching that year.  I loved the Cowboys by then.  And I think it was because my family were all Giant fans.  And I remember everybody was rooting for Pittsburgh in my grandmother's house.  My Uncle Mike, my Uncle Mark, Gary, all of them were rooting for the Steelers. 
[01:07:30]  And I wanted...  And you wanted to be a little different, didn't you?  I wanted fucking Cowboys.  I bet I know what it really is.  And I love Starback.  I bet I know what it really is.  What?  Because Paul Stanley had the star on his eye.  And they had the star on the helmet.  And you equated the two.  And your love for Kiss all of a sudden turned into your love for the Cowboys and anything with stars on it.  You know what? 
[01:08:00]  That might be a good...  That's a pretty good idea.  You might be...  There is something...  I guess they were also shown more than other home teams were.  Yeah, yeah, they were.  Like other teams was the Cowboys.  They were considered like America's football team.  Yeah.  They tried to present themselves like that.  Like the Braves when they were on TBS.  Right.  That was really the first team that you could watch nationally.  Super team.  Yeah.  America's team.  Yes.  The Braves.  There was a funny line after...  I would love to get Hollywood Henderson in here.  Thomas Henderson was a defensive player for the Cowboys back in those days. 
[01:08:30]  And he was a real big coke head.  And he was telling...  I read his book.  It was amazing.  But he was telling stories about fucking...  He had a Vicks vapor inhaler.  And he was doing coke on the sidelines at the Super Bowl.  Wow.  All these millions of people watched.  Jesus.  I would love to talk to him.  But like...  I remember they said they were South America's team instead of America's team.  Because they were all doing blow.  All doing coke.  But to my best of my ability, I don't remember why I became...  Like people think I just like the good teams.  But I remember why I like the Lakers.  I'm not a basketball fan. 
[01:09:00]  I never was.  But I liked Abdul-Jabbar because he was in the Airplane movies.  I had no allegiance to basketball.  And I'm in a Caldor one time.  And I'm watching them play.  And they were losing.  I usually like a team when they lose for some reason the first time.  I think they were losing a championship to the Celtics.  And I just remember...  Oh, that's that guy I liked, Kareem.  So I watched and I began to just enjoy them.  And the next year I started watching.  Yeah.  You root for the underdog.  Not even the underdog.  But it just seems like it's worked out that way.  Like they were both good teams.  But I don't remember... 
[01:09:30]  I wish I could remember exactly what brought me to them.  Jabbar brought me to the Lakers.  I like the players.  I love James Worthy.  I think you remember liking the guys on the team.  I became a Celtics fan for a while there.  When it was the Lakers-Celtics.  Fuck yeah.  Even though I'm a Knicks fan.  I know that's a little fucked up.  But they had some great teams in the 80s.  Yeah, you did.  Absolutely.  Back in the 80s.  They would go back and forth.  The Celtics and the Lakers.  I had to go Boston every fucking time there.  Had to.  I just loved fucking Michael Cooper and his big high socks. 
[01:10:00]  Fucking dopey Kurt Rambis.  Who was the other guy they had?  If anyone remembers the Lakers center, he was black.  Michael something.  I used to hate him.  I just don't understand how they kept their big black dicks in those little shorts.  Well, Dice has a funny bit about how the longer shorts...  Like when it was the white guys years ago, they had short shorts.  Yeah.  And then as all the blacks came into the game, they had to drink the knee-length shorts.  Dice has a very funny bit of that.  That's funny.  The shorts were ridiculous.  What's his name?  Michael something or the big...  What? 
[01:10:30]  Huh?  No, not Michael Cooper.  They wore boy shorts on the court, basically.  In the fucking 70s and stuff.  Yeah, I remember seeing those.  Hilarious.  How do they keep their cockheads from not popping out when they jumped up for a rebound?  They all tucked into their assholes like trannies.  Who was the fucking...  Because my Jamaican friends used to laugh at me when I was there to bring this center.  It wasn't Kurt Rambis, who was a white guy.  Oh, Mitch Kupchak.  Was it Mitch Kupchak?  For the Lakers? 
[01:11:00]  No.  It was a black guy.  Light-skinned black guy.  I think he was from one of the islands.  Oh.  For what team?  I'm sorry.  Lakers Backup Center in, I want to say, 88, 89, 86, in that...  Wow.  I know it's a really obscure name, but I can picture his...  I bet you we're going to know the name when we find it.  But he used to annoy me.  Not a...  Fuck, who played for the Lakers back then?  I don't know.  Somebody will know.  But he would always annoy me.  Really light-skinned black?  Yes. 
[01:11:30]  I believe he was a light-skinned guy.  And he came in to play center?  Yeah.  He was...  I think he was Abdul-Jabbar's backup.  Is that Michael Thompson?  You know what?  There you go.  Yeah.  Michael Thompson.  Son of a bitch, eh?  Yeah.  I was thinking.  I was trying to remember.  You're good.  I'm like...  That's amazing.  You just...  Anthony has this way of thinking where he'll just look down straight ahead in front of him  for a couple seconds.  And he has the answer.  As long as I can just look and concentrate. 
[01:12:00]  If you're looking at pal talk, that's why.  He didn't get it.  All right, Chip.  Michael Thompson.  Fuck yeah, man.  A lot of people are yelling because I'm saying how amazing Brady is.  He's got 940 passing yards.  We'll see how long his arm holds up.  Phil Simms has the record.  I did not know that.  And what would that record be?  Most yards ever for two games.  Yeah, for two games.  He's got the record for the first two games.  First two games.  Oh, so Phil Simms has the record for any two games in a season. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, that's a little different.  This guy has them.  They break records down now.  Well, you know, the most passing yards before the Ides of March are...  Because that means Brady has a really good shot of grabbing that record.  If he's got one game already, over 500 passing yards, he's got a real good shot at it.  And we've got to acknowledge Cam Newton.  He broke the rookie quarterback record.  Cam Newton held the record for three hours, and then Tom Brady broke it.  Yeah.  He held the record for...  Cam Newton, he's a rookie out of... 
[01:13:00]  He plays for Carolina.  Yeah.  He was born in 1989 because I had to look it up.  1989.  Yeah.  He's got 853 passing yards in the first two games.  Wow.  As a rookie.  But a fig is good.  That's pretty...  Huh?  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  That's...  Wow, that's pretty good.  I haven't watched...  Wow.  I haven't watched any of the, yeah, Pats games. 
[01:13:30]  But is it pretty much business as usual where Brady just has forever to throw the ball?  Yeah.  He's got a great line.  It's astounding how he can just be like, yeah, all right, let's look around and see who's  open there.  That helps, but he fucking hits the receiver every goddamn time.  And to watch those passes, it's like the thing doesn't even have an arc.  It's going straight ahead without dropping. 
[01:14:00]  Insanity.  He's way better than my boy Sanchez, but Sanchez will work some things out.  Wow.  He's one of the best ever, man.  Brady is...  I mean, I'm saying that with no shit, Jim, but the guy is fucking...  Ridiculous.  Yeah, we always look back on great quarterbacks and, well, they were great back, but you're  watching one of the greatest ever.  Yeah, yeah.  Ridiculous.  And I hate him.  I wish his fucking...  His shins would be cut off.  I hate him.  You don't like him.  That son of a bitch is good, though, man.  He needs one more Super Bowl to get that taste out of his mouth from that fucking...  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  What's he got, four wins or three wins?  How many Super Bowls?  I would go with three.  I think Starbuck had...  Did Starbuck have two or three?  I want to see...  This is where we suck.  Beat the Colts.  I don't know.  Beat...  But then again, we don't have the master computer set ready to go.  Yeah.  Ah, no, yeah, yeah, pass me around.  I like Mad Dog.  I only like doing his voice aches.  I can't, because Anthony does it well.  I just like that the stats can just pour out.  Tom Brady has three.  Three, okay.  Starbuck had two?  I thought so.  Oh, Starbuck was a better scrambler.  No, he wasn't. 
[01:15:00]  He was.  Starbuck had scramblers.  No, he was a great scrambler.  In the old days, the quarterbacks used to fucking scramble and hustle.  No more scrambling.  That's why they can't walk these days.  See what happened to him yesterday.  Well, Fran Tarkenton was a great scrambler.  Yeah.  Here's Starbuck.  By the way, I was reading Emmett's book.  I'm going to finish the book.  Starbuck fucking sold his real estate company recently for $600 million.  Wow.  That son of a bitch got into it.  I love when I hear these guys.  John Elway up in Denver. 
[01:15:30]  Aikman's got a successful deal.  Emmett makes a lot of money.  I love when these guys make a lot of money outside of football.  They don't just become fucking Nate Newton disasters.  How much do you think he made his best year in football?  You know what?  Back in the 70s?  I don't know.  Early 80s?  Fuck.  What do you think?  I bet you it wasn't even making a million.  It probably made shit.  Yeah.  Danny White was the kicker, punter, fucking hat maker, seamstress.  Danny White did everything.  He's kicking and receiving, and he's bunting, and he's bringing the water, and he's massaging  the calves of the sore players.  All right.  We get it. 
[01:16:00]  He's the only guy on the team right now.  It's just Danny White.  It's just Danny White.  He's taking on the whole team.  Does all things, none of them well.  I forgot about Danny White.  Oh, my.  I think he held his own ball when he kicked it, too.  I mean, it was really confusing.  You mean Raphael Septian and his stinky 12-year-old girl fingers?  That's where he got in big trouble.  Oh, that's right.  Number one.  Number one.  I love little Raphael.  Oh, boy.  They were bad boys.  You're very fresh.  Did we cover football, Travis?  Yeah, you sure did.  I think we did a great job. 
[01:16:30]  That was our sports break.  As much as you can.  I was being called a faggot because I was watching the Emmys instead of football last  night, and I'm like, I watched football all fucking day.  Eagles, Falcons.  I didn't care enough to watch Eagles, Falcons.  I don't really have an interest in the Eagles.  What, are you betting on it?  Yes.  Huh?  Yes.  Who won?  What, are you going to bet?  Falcons.  Good.  Fuck the Eagles.  Gwyneth Paltrow.  One more clip from the Emmys.  Sure.  Shows how good she is when the teleprompter stops working.  Oh, boy. 
[01:17:00]  Okay, the prompter's down, so I'm going to wing it.  Um, here are the nominees for Best Comedy Series.  Great job.  Outstanding comedy.  There you go.  Look at her.  They're just dopes when they don't have stuff written for her.  Dude, they are just dopes.  They're just dopes.  You couldn't make fun of the prompter being down?  I don't know.  Like, holy sh-  Like, I know my acting at times has been the brunt of several jokes. 
[01:17:30]  As well as several disgusted faces and turned off televisions.  But at least I know it to make fun of it.  These assholes.  They do stink.  They're just-  They're fucking dunderheads.  Yeah.  Excuse my language.  Dunder.  Oh, God.  What did our friend Chris say?  Oh, sorry.  No, no, no.  That's okay.  It was just a dumb memory.  No, go, go, go.  I know he got mad and I forget what he goes.  He got mad in the pool.  Our buddy Chris and me and my friend Frank were in the pool. 
[01:18:00]  And Chris got mad and he went,  Dumb, dumb, lunkhead.  Dumb, dumb, lunkhead.  Ah, shit.  Oh, they got a high school band and pep squad there on TV.  Fox and Friends.  I'm watching that.  Yeah.  They're looking good.  Yeah, they're dressed all fucking, a little too much on the clothing.  I'm just mad at, I'm just mad at girls lately.  Why?  Yeah.  Because they're fucking keeping their, their, their boobies like, you know, pushed, pushed 
[01:18:30]  down and stuff.  Yeah.  When we were growing up, man, those things would flop around.  Big fucking juicy nipples.  Remember a girl would just walk around, she couldn't help it, everything was just flopping  around.  Yeah, they're all tightened up now.  You don't see-  Sports bras and fucking-  You don't see women being women when you just walk around the city anymore.  They got a lot of support.  When a, when a, when a lady decides she needed to get in shape, they had no workout fucking  gear for them, so everything was just flopping around.  Ah, they'd just be on the treadmill with their tits banging around. 
[01:19:00]  Now I see them in the park and stuff running and nothing moves.  Yeah.  That's just bothersome.  Yeah.  Like, they wrap that shit up now.  They wrap it up, Ant.  They wrap it up.  Yeah.  No cleavage anymore.  No.  Cleavage is not happening as much.  A thing of the past.  We're going to talk about Floyd Mayweather when we get back.  A lot of people are pissed off and Larry Merchant and that whole fucking deal.  I want to hear that because I didn't hear-  Yeah, we got it, Jimmy.  And I will say, I'm watching the Mayweather press conference where he's getting- 
[01:19:30]  And I see this little hype man yelling and screaming in Mayweather's camp on the stage  at the weigh-in, and it's fucking Kevin Hart.  No, was it?  Really?  That son of a bitch is everywhere.  They hired him as a-  Well, they're friends probably.  It's probably for free.  Yeah, okay.  I'm guessing it's their friends.  Do we have the unedited version of the exchange?  I'm not sure.  I hope so, because I heard it on 10-10 wins and it was like, beep, beep.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure we got the good version.  I would like, because it was on HBO, so.  By the way, even though Cam Newton had that great game, they did lose. 
[01:20:00]  Packers beat them.  Cam is good.  Packers look good this year, too.  Oh, Travis.  Well, yeah.  They're the Super Bowl champions.  Yeah, I know.  I understand.  Is he 2-0?  Packers, yeah.  Lions?  Are the Lions 2-0?  Lions are 2-0.  What?  Lions are really good this year.  How did that happen?  They're good.  Two forfeits.  I actually saw on the paper, and I hate when they fucking write this.  Uh-oh, someone better break up the Lions. 
[01:20:30]  That shit.  When a team is doing so well, you better break them up.  Ugh.  You know, I was watching Bad News Bears again, the original.  How goddamn funny that movie is.  Yeah.  And they had to reboot that shit.  Take out everything that made the movie funny.  Everything.  I understand Planet of the Apes, because, like I said, CGI.  I mean, all right.  But the fucking, the Tanner Boyle line.  What was the line he fucking, it was some racist line when Tatum O'Neal was on the team. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not this one.  No, that's not it.  That's where he gets dumped in the garbage pail.  Oh, yeah, when he fights, because Loomis or whatever.  Not Loomis, that's fucking Halloween.  It was a disgrace, what they did to this movie.  It's disgusting.  With Billy Bob Thornton.  Kids aren't drinking.  Walter Matthau was driving a car.  No seatbelt.  Drinking a beer.  And the kids were drinking beers.  Racist rant.  It was such a funny line. 
[01:21:30]  I forgot it was in the movie.  But it didn't hurt the movie.  They would never allow that.  No, not these days.  No fucking way.  Because kid movies like this were tolerable, because the interaction, there was one where  fucking Matthau threw beer on her at one point.  Yeah.  He got mad at her.  He just wanted her to leave it, like, stop bothering him.  He was like, wah, he just flings up beer on her.  I know a lot of people are really starting to think about throwing their DVDs away.  I would say save that shit, because I think the next stage in Hollywood, they're going  to clean up all this shit. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, you might be right.  They're going to edit the shit out of it, all the racist stuff that made comedies funny.  I'm telling you, you know, like we said, to start this hour with the walkie talkies,  you watch.  You watch.  Another 10 years go by, and you're not going to find this shit online, you know, in the  original form.  It used to be where they would deal with kids, they would deal with them, like, it  was funny to hear Matthau dealing with these kids like adults.  Yep.  It was just real dialogue written between children and adults, and it was funny.  And it was believable. 
[01:22:30]  Like, fucking, uh, I watched again.  Was the line, uh, nigger, Jew, spick, and now a girl?  And now a girl or a chick, he said something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He couldn't believe she was on the team, and nigger, a Jew, a spick, and now a girl.  It was just very funny the way he said it.  And I was watching the Vic Morrow character, the antagonist, the, uh, the jerk-off fucking  other coach, and, uh, but even him, he wasn't such a jerk-off that he wasn't a believable 
[01:23:00]  person.  It was like, he was actually...  He was concerned about the safety of it.  He was worried about the kids getting hurt, like, and he was at one point, he made sure  the kid got on the stretcher, and then he was really worried that he threw it to the  kid's head.  He didn't want that.  Isn't that ironic?  Worried about someone else's head.  Absolutely.  He would have been keeping his peepers on his own.  Yeah, he should have been watching his own fucking head.  Nice.  But they didn't make him such an over-the-top bad guy that you couldn't believe him.  Like, he was like a legitimate dude.  That was who he was.  Yeah.  I really, I loved him in that movie. 
[01:23:30]  What time is Stephen Wright here?  I don't want to babble through Stephen Wright.  He's not here yet, right?  Yeah, no, we're going to take a break.  Oh, okay.  Are we going to take a break?  I got to eat.  You got that clip online?  Yeah, it's probably hard to find, right?  That's what I'm telling you.  A lot of people think about throwing those DVDs away.  Don't fucking do it.  Yeah, don't do it.  Because they're going to start fucking with that shit.  Yeah, Stephen Wright's coming in, Jimmy, at 8.15.  And The Great, how the fuck did we get this one?  Tony Bennett at 8.30.  Holy crap.  He has a...  Tony Bennett.  He has a CD.  I was looking up his bio. 
[01:24:00]  1951 was his first number one hit, I think.  Jesus.  Was it 51?  He's been a big star since 12 years before Kennedy was killed.  A big star.  But that's how long he's been famous.  That's 60 years ago, right?  Fuck, man.  His first number one was because of you in 1951.  His first number one was then.  What did it sound like?  Do we know the song?  I'm sure the sex bagel can pull it up.  Oh, yeah.  Yay.  Sex bagel's not in there.  Oh, boy.  Eric had to make a big duty, and you guys didn't take a break. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Eric always has to make a big duty during the show.  Yeah.  You notice that?  Yeah.  He's trudging.  Hilarious.  He's such a heavy walker.  He's a trudger.  I'm sure it's a lot of weekend food that he had.  Oh, God.  Monday shits are terrible for poor...  A lot of meat.  We got it.  Poor fat face.  You want to hear it?  Yeah.  Poor fat face.  Tony Bennett at 8.30.  A little taste of this from 1951.  Oh, man.  That's good enough.  You can go to break now. 
[01:25:00]  Forget it.  You blew the bit.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, that would have been funny if we...  The bit was five seconds of Tony Bennett.  And not him singing.  That was a complete epic fail on everyone's part.  There you go.  All right.  We'll continue with this.  Sirius XM.  The Virus.  Gather round, kids, for a tale of childhood trauma.  It's a molestation memory with our friend, Jim Florentine.  My dad used to take us to wrestling matches at Madison Square Garden.  And we met this guy out front who would sell wrestling pictures. 
[01:25:30]  Fat guy.  300 pounds.  A bad mustache.  You know.  And we became friends with him.  Somehow.  He's like, oh, give me your address.  He started sending us pictures of all the kids in the neighborhood.  Then he would call me on the phone and tell me about the match the night before.  And my voice was about this.  It was this deep at 14.  He's on the other end.  And I'm asking all these questions.  And he's fucking breathing heavy.  I had no idea.  But then he wound up staying over at my house. 
[01:26:00]  He knew all the kids in the neighborhood because we all go to matches.  He convinced my dad.  He's like, oh, you know, I want to hang with the kids on a Saturday afternoon.  He took the bus from New York in the middle of Jersey.  And my parents were a little weird about it.  Like, I don't know.  But it's like, all right.  You know.  They talked to the other parents and neighbor.  You think this is all right?  You know, he's a 40-year-old guy hanging around 14-year-olds.  They put him in the guest room the night before.  I wake up in the morning.  I'm sleeping.  He has his hand on my pants.  He snuck down there.  And I fucking jump.  I go, what are you doing?  He grabbed my cock.  He goes, I'm showing you a magic trick.  I'm like, a magic trick? 
[01:26:30]  I just said, I ran to the door to go tell my brothers, my older brothers.  And he blocked the door.  He goes, he went right to the photo album.  He goes, look, I got 50 pictures.  And I'll give you 35 of them if you don't say anything.  But my brothers were like, my brothers afterwards go, you got to tell mom and dad  about this.  I go, no, because they were going to make me give the pictures back.  I'm like, fuck that.  I earned them.  Fucking kissed him on the cheek.  I sat on his lap.  He grabbed my cock.  I should have got that in this camera.  This has been a molestation moment with our friend, Jim Florentine.  Now you know why he is the way he is. 
[01:27:00]  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big fuck you to National Grid, who decided to turn on the power at Foxborough  Stadium rather than the town of Foxborough itself.  You should be hung up like pigs and slaughtered.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I'd like to say fuck you to the guys who keep playing the same fuck through line.  Stop doing it.  Change it.  Play something different.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this fuck you goes out to prime time Sam Roberts. 
[01:27:30]  I'm so sick of hearing you during Opie and Anthony and then your stupid shit show after.  I have to turn the fucking radio off.  I hear nails on a chalkboard voice.  Your smarmy, sarcastic, overly obvious sense of humor.  You have no fucking talent, you're annoying, you're a piece of shit, and I hate hearing  you on the radio.  Shut the fuck up.  Damn fuck you.  Fuck you.  This fuck you is the Chip Chipperson.  I hope you fucking die.  I hope, uh, I hope, uh, fuck that one up. 
[01:28:00]  Fuck you.  This was out to my two ex-wife that took everything.  My house, my car, my kids.  Fuck you, Colin.  Fuck you.  I'd like to give a big F you to Danny Ross.  I don't know why I'm doing it.  I just don't like him and I don't like his face.  Fuck you, Danny Ross.  Go to hell.  Fuck you.  Hi, I'd like to just give a big fuck you to the executives at XM who would stifle, slow  down, or criticize the art that comes out of this show as in Opie and Anthony. 
[01:28:30]  Fuck you, dickheads.  Let them do their fucking show and mind your own fucking business.  Fuck you.  I have a big fuck you to my ear hair for growing every fucking day, and for my birthday last  week, I got a goddamn fucking nose and ear hair trimmer for my family, so it's a fucking  problem that everybody sees.  I have no fucking hair on my head, so fuck you, ear hair.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I just wanted to give a big F you to Troy Kwan for not following his name, same decade  as Francine in the face.  Call the Opie and Anthony F you line, 866-FU-LINE-1. 
[01:29:00]  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  One other thing about football, and then we're going to move on. 
[01:29:30]  So the Bills are having a great second half yesterday, and we're watching the game in  New York, and 4 o'clock comes, I'm like, oh boy, here they go, but they stayed with  the game, which was amazing to me.  It always frustrates the fuck out of me when you, you know, invest in a game, and then they  got to cut it off, because they got to start the 4 o'clock games.  It's like, why even bother at this point?  Right.  And especially in the old days when you didn't have the internet or anything, so you just  fucked.  You're in your living room going, oh, okay, great, I guess I'll find out tomorrow who 
[01:30:00]  won.  You know?  At least now you can maybe, you know, run to the old computer or something and get to  the end of the game.  What year was the Heidi game?  Was that 67?  The what?  The Heidi game.  Oh, Jesus.  The Heidi game.  Right.  Was it a playoff game?  I think it was.  Yeah, I think it was too, right?  Jets, huh?  Yeah.  And they just ended the coverage of the game and went to Heidi.  A movie.  Whose move was that?  You hope whoever did that. 
[01:30:30]  But you think, you know, they could figure out a better system at this point.  They've been doing this for, obviously, since 67 or whatever.  Leave the game in the screen or something?  Whatever.  Yeah, just fucking give me a pip or something.  What's that?  I said pip.  Or start the game at 340.  Yeah.  But when they, you know, watch the game and then it's getting really good and they're  like, well, you know, contract the states that we have to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:31:00]  And the lorries can't get together and figure it all out?  Yeah.  But I was surprised.  They kept with the Bills game.  It was an amazing finish to that game.  Unless, I guess, you were in Boston.  I guess they certainly did not keep with the game.  All right.  There was a big fight over the weekend.  Anyone watch it?  Yeah.  Big fight.  I wish I did, actually.  I was trying to find it for free online.  Dana White has just made it hard to watch boxing, right?  Yeah.  I'd much rather watch UFC than boxing at this point. 
[01:31:30]  I know this was a big one and all, but I just didn't watch.  I didn't really care as much about this one.  I think that's how a lot of people feel about boxing these days.  Yeah.  It's, um...  Fucking...  Mayweather's great.  He's 42-0 now, but...  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  He's an interesting fighter to watch.  He has a weird way of fighting.  Like, he, uh...  Did you see the ending of this fight? 
[01:32:00]  No, I did not.  It was...  I heard, yeah.  The headbutt and, uh...  Headbutt and a vicious combination.  Well, what happened was, there was an apology that was going on a little too long.  Ortiz just kept apologizing.  And then he got, like, fucking caught.  He got punched in his face.  Right.  Did he get hit during the apology?  Yeah, but he was apologizing too much, so I don't know...  It was like, they touched gloves, and then they kind of hugged.  Right.  And then Mayweather just punched him in his face.  And then Ortiz looked at the referee, and then Mayweather punched him in his face again 
[01:32:30]  and knocked him out.  Hilarious.  It was really...  It was funny, but I think Ortiz was apologizing too much, if you ask my opinion.  Well, he fucking...  He really headbutted them.  He headbutted...  People that know fighting way more than us, please call and give your opinion on this.  Who knows fighting more than us?  I think no one.  Where's a clip?  Well, Jimmy knows a lot about fighting.  You really do, Jimmy.  Gotta be a clip.  It's the old school guys.  There is, but they keep getting taken down and replaced with, like, illegal...  Stop taking the clips down.  The fight's over already.  Everyone who's gonna watch it... 
[01:33:00]  Gotta find one, though.  Someone's gotta have one up there before it gets taken down.  But there was a headbutt, and then Ortiz felt bad, so he was apologizing, and then he apologized  again.  Then I think he apologized a third time, and then he got caught.  And just fucking...  Was Mayweather being dirty?  Did Ortiz feel like he got sucker punched?  Yeah.  I mean, that's what people...  I don't know if Ortiz specifically said it, but people who were supporting Ortiz said  he got sucker punched.  But how about you just apologize once and then get back into the fucking fight?  And you know what?  When you're in the ring, you don't have to wait for anything. 
[01:33:30]  You punch the guy in the face, and then when he turns around and goes, hey, I told you you  to punch me in the face.  You punch him in the face again.  Here's Marcos.  They had, by the way, they had the score 10-9 the first three rounds Mayweather.  I was just reading one guy's synopsis of it, so it looked like Mayweather was way ahead  of Mayweather.  Well, let's go with Marcos, who knows certainly more about this than I.  Marcos.  Hey, good morning, boys.  What's up, brother?  This is what happened.  Ortiz had Mayweather pinned against the rope, and he was hitting him, and he intentionally 
[01:34:00]  thrusted his head forward to headbutt him in the face.  It looked like some MMA shit.  And so they took a point away.  He apologized to Mayweather.  He even gave him a kiss on the cheek.  So right when he went to go touch gloves, he went to go hug him again.  And as he hugged him, he was backing up.  Mayweather just punched him in the fucking jaw, and then he had this tongue look, hit him 
[01:34:30]  again, knocked him on the floor.  The referee and everyone was looking like, oh, shit, is that legal?  And he started counting.  And the fight went over.  And the really funny part about it is you have to see the Larry Merchant post.  Yeah, yeah.  We got that queued up and ready to go.  And the controversy a lot of people are saying is with the ref on this one, huh?  Really?  Well, I'm sorry to cut you off.  No, you know what it is?  Not for nothing, guys.  I'm never going to watch boxing again after this, because you could see this felt like  some WWE type shit, to be honest with you. 
[01:35:00]  It felt like it was set up.  It felt like Vince McMahon was on the side saying, count, count, count.  You know, it was just crazy.  Huh.  Interesting.  Okay.  We actually got a replay of the clip here.  So this is them, first they're hugging, and then this picks up, like, right as they're  breaking the hug.  As they're breaking the hug.  So Larry, oh, okay.  After Mayweather just clocks.  We touch, we touch gloves.  We back to find hooks. 
[01:35:30]  Right?  Look at him.  And that's all she wrote.  So it was fucking knocked him out.  It was just an automatic response.  Pause.  I think Mayweather's making a good point there.  They touch gloves.  As soon as you touch gloves, that's it.  Get back into defensive stance, motherfucker.  You don't wait to fucking back up properly or any of that shit.  As soon as you touch gloves, fight on.  And Ortiz is looking at the ref like, hey, he just hit me.  Yeah.  And boy, did he get fucking caught.  But that was stupid on his part to look at the ref.  Did the ref call for the fight to start again?  I don't know. 
[01:36:00]  What was Ortiz's confusion?  Usually they go, you know, touch gloves.  And usually that means I know this much.  As soon as you touch gloves, game on.  Mayweather was just really quick after the touching of the gloves.  Maybe the ref should have been between them.  Okay.  Wow.  Oh, there's the headbutt.  Oh, my God.  He did it on purpose.  All right.  So he backs him off.  The ref calls time.  Ortiz hugs him.  That's the first apology. 
[01:36:30]  Okay.  He's texting ways.  He's telling the judges he gave him a headbutt.  And then they.  All right.  So he was sorry again.  No, his second apology.  He got caught up in the heat of battle, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He thrusts us out.  Now he's going to touch gloves.  A little hug.  Bam.  Bam.  That was dirty.  You think that was dirty?  Yep.  Absolutely.  Morris, get on my.  Absolutely.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Why do you think that was dirty, Jimmy?  I'll tell you what.  I don't know.  I'm not saying it's illegal. 
[01:37:00]  I think Mayweather was just fucking quick.  But I also think what Ortiz did was dirty, too.  Because in that moment, these guys, when they fight, like we've all watched enough fights.  When they touch gloves, I guess technically you can do that, but they all know the way it's done.  It's like you touch gloves.  They were kind of just coming out of an embrace.  You back off.  Right.  He didn't give, and I'm not saying he has to, but I've never seen that in all the years  I've been watching fighting.  I've never seen a fighter hit a fighter coming out of almost a hug.  Like, could you go back a little bit?  Yeah, that was.  That looked like.  It was just too quick.  And Mayweather's so fucking fast, man. 
[01:37:30]  So was Mayweather supposed to wait until the guy backs up properly?  The ref probably should have been between them.  Yeah.  To give him that time to back off.  Yeah, the ref was nowhere in the middle of him.  Like, watch.  Mayweather's left is deadly.  Hold on one second.  Let's play that again.  When Mr. Fuji came in, though, and threw the sand.  They're hugging.  They're kind of just hugging.  Yeah.  But Ortiz has his hands down.  He's coming out of a hug.  Yeah, no, I understand.  He just gave him a little embrace.  They both knew what was going on, and Mayweather just.  But they tapped gloves, Jimmy. 
[01:38:00]  Did they even tap gloves?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The punch came after the tapping of the gloves.  What do you think, Marcos?  To be honest, you guys, I do agree with Jimmy.  It felt dirty.  But to be honest with you, they said it.  The referee put his hands down.  Like, you know when he does a little chop to dump.  Yeah, the chop is like, okay, action, go.  Yeah, but they say keep your hands up at all times.  They always say that.  Remember he said in the beginning, keep your hands up at all times.  So it felt dirty, but what he did was technically legal, but I think it was legal. 
[01:38:30]  You know what the odd thing is?  Ortiz didn't even have time to bring his arm up.  They had just finished up.  And I was looking.  Look at Ortiz's right hand when they come apart.  It looks like he actually is trying to bring it up.  He didn't even give him time for that.  Look.  Look at his right hand.  Bam!  Like, his right arm was way the fuck down.  His right arm was down by his side.  I think the ref might have blew it a little bit.  Should be in between those guys a bit until they step up properly. 
[01:39:00]  Wow.  Step back properly.  That was dirty.  And again, the technicality, the technically legal thing, sure.  I'm not saying he should be fucking.  But again, Ortiz fucking did headbutt him purposely.  Oh, man.  And that was the second time they're going to go hug.  Yeah.  They already did this.  They already did this.  Why are we going to hug again?  I agree.  But it just.  It was one of those things we both know what's happening.  It's unsportsmanlike.  And a lot of guys do that shit.  Like, Ortiz was giving him a lot of respect as a champion.  Going, like, I know I fucking.  I know what just happened there. 
[01:39:30]  And he was.  But three times he apologized.  There were three apologies.  That never happens in boxing.  When Ortiz gets hit with that first shot and kind of looks at the ref,  what Mayweather must have seen is a dazed guy.  With his guard completely down.  And the fight is on.  Yep.  And he fucking hit him right on the button.  Look at how fucking quick Mayweather.  Mayweather is great, man.  God damn it.  He's fucking fast.  Look at how fucking.  Boom.  And then he just saw it.  And go, here's a little left. 
[01:40:00]  Ah, here's my right hand.  A lot of people say Ortiz is an idiot for leaving his hands down like that.  He was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, Mars, what do you think?  I think Mayweather is absolutely right.  I mean, it's unsportsmanlike.  But we hugged already.  We were done with kissing and all that other shit.  Now you're coming at me again.  No, it's time to fight.  The classy move would have been to back off and restart.  But you know what?  There's nothing wrong with what he did.  And then a few seconds before that, he just got headbutted.  Yeah.  So this guy's pissed off.  So he's still pissed.  Yeah.  But Ant, they hugged. 
[01:40:30]  They tapped one glove each.  And this was the third apology.  Enough.  Enough on the face.  Yeah, that's what he did.  I mean, I'm not saying that he should be given a loss.  I'm not saying he should be given a loss.  But it was one of those things where I'm watching that.  Why am I shocked seeing it like that when I've seen a thousand fights and a thousand MMA fights?  Why does that shock me?  Like, obviously, it looks weird.  All right.  Thank you, Marcos.  Jay in Jersey has a little more on this.  Jay?  Yeah, guys. 
[01:41:00]  The whole point is the ref fucking totally blew it.  He never restarted the fight.  He called timeout with the headbutt.  He called timeout with the headbutt.  When they came back to the center of the ring, and as they went to hug, he never restarted  the fight.  So, Ortiz, in the interview, said it.  He goes, the ref never restarted the fight.  So, I was standing there, hugging him, apologizing.  The ref never came.  You know, like, the ref is supposed to be between them.  He's supposed to be between them.  And he's supposed to go, fight! 
[01:41:30]  And start.  Scott makes a great point.  They stopped, when he stopped the fight, when that ref stopped the fight because of the  headbutt, and went around to the coroners and told the judges, look, headbutt, headbutt,  headbutt.  He had timed out.  He had stopped the, actually stopped the clock, if I'm not correct.  Right?  And never, and never restarted the fight.  Let's see that again.  Hold on, but you know what?  Unless the ref said something that we just didn't hear, he might have just said it and  not done the umpire move.  All right.  Here it is. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  Okay, there's it.  Here comes the headbutt.  Bam.  All right.  So, now.  Why would he headbutt him?  Why would he do that?  Timeout.  Timeout.  Timeout.  There's the hug.  I'm sorry.  The ref is pulling Ortiz away.  Right.  He said, time, time, time.  One point.  Now he's touching head.  One point.  Now watch.  He's holding Ortiz, his left hand.  Ortiz, and they might have just touched.  So, that's the second apology by Ortiz.  The referee is warning him.  Yeah, that's restarting it. 
[01:42:30]  Wait a minute.  I think he was in the midst of restarting.  It looked like he restarted.  That's weird, man.  He said, did the bell ring, I think.  Or something.  He was looking at the timer, like, okay, we're ready to restart.  He could stop.  He stepped back from the...  He wasn't in the middle, and then he stepped back.  It looked like he made a very subtle...  Yeah, he clapped his hands for the fight to resume.  Yeah.  But then he took his eyes off and looked at the timer.  Timekeeper, yeah.  To make sure they were restarting.  But is that what he would say?  The ref fucked up a bit, huh?  Yeah, I think so.  Here it is again. 
[01:43:00]  The ref was a bit unsure of what was going on here.  Watch.  Covering.  Oh, no.  He's going to go, oh, no.  I want to hear the Larry Merchant interview, because...  Yeah, yeah.  That's the best.  Well, that's...  This is the whole argument and everything, so we can watch it if you want.  Yeah.  Fine.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Floyd is the black gentleman.  Larry Merchant is the older white gentleman.  Just in case.  I want to thank my team.  I got hit with a dirty shot, and it's protect yourself at all times. 
[01:43:30]  I hit him with a left foot right hand, and that ended the boat.  So you're saying that even though it appeared that he wasn't protecting himself, and thought  that that was part of the ceremony that you were going through of apology, that you unfairly  took advantage of it.  Oh, boy.  What do you say to those who say, what'd you do there? 
[01:44:00]  You were winning the fight and in charge.  I just want to say, everybody that bought pay-per-view, that came out to Las Vegas, thank you.  And anyway, Floyd, you know you're a promoter, but now we're talking to you as a prize fighter.  Let's take a look at what happened at the end of the fight, and you describe it.  All I hear is Jay Moore, by the way.  Yeah.  All right, there's the hug.  We touch gloves.  Now the time.  We're back to fight hook.  Right hand.  And that's all she wrote. 
[01:44:30]  So for you, it was just an automatic response.  Let's get on with the fight.  Let's protect yourself at all times.  He does something dirty.  We're not here to cry and complain about what he did dirty or what I did dirty.  I was victorious.  If he wanted a rematch, he can get a rematch.  You were in charge of the fight.  You were aggressive.  Merchants beside himself.  And taking advantage of what you saw as a flaw.  You know what I'm going to do?  Because you don't ever give me a fair shake. 
[01:45:00]  You know that?  So I'm going to let you talk to Victor Ortiz, all right?  I'm through.  They put somebody else up and give me an interview.  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  You never give me a fair shake.  HBO needs to fire you.  You don't know shit about boxing.  You ain't shit.  You're not shit.  I wish I was 50 years younger and I'd kick your ass.  Fucking merchant.  Fucking merchant.  I wish I was 50 years younger.  I got moxie.  I'd kick your ass.  Drops the N-bomb on him.  Like old school. 
[01:45:30]  But he had to say 50 years younger.  Holy shit.  I was 50 years younger.  Holy shit.  If I was 50 years younger at the end of my boxing career.  He wants to go back to 1961 so he can fight him.  Wow.  Merchant was pissed.  But also Floyd knew what he did.  Yes, he did.  Floyd didn't say when he goes that.  Floyd didn't go, what are you talking about?  Floyd goes, protect yourself at all times.  Floyd knew what he did.  He knew how it would be perceived.  The ref was not watching what he should have been watching. 
[01:46:00]  The ref fucked up.  That was a WWE ref move right there.  Jim Cornette was distracting.  Oh my God.  The ref wasn't watching.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Jimmy Hart threw the megaphone out.  The megaphone out.  Get him off the apron.  There's just always something happening.  Double team maneuver.  Oh my God.  Yes.  The ref isn't looking.  There was a lot of shit going on there.  Yeah.  Mayweather I guess technically should have gave him maybe another second.  But legally he did.  Put his hands up.  He was annoyed about that dirty shot. 
[01:46:30]  And legally I think he was well within his means to start to fight that fight.  If the ref restarted the fight, he should have been looking at the fighters.  Not restarting the fight and looking at the timekeeper.  Well he started the fight really in a strange way.  Yeah.  Did you also notice?  He did not have control of the situation.  Did you also notice Ortiz the first shot he looks over at the ref?  Why not take the first shot and put your hands up?  And put your fucking hands back up.  Well that's where Ortiz made a mistake.  Like hey ref when are you going to start the fight?  You don't do that.  You don't assume that the ref's going to do quote the right thing and go oh wait that 
[01:47:00]  was you know not not uh yes yes kidding.  It's a comedy of errors.  There you go.  In his Miss Meany glasses.  Ran to the microphone to say.  His fucking Nana glasses.  You know it's uh but it's an embarrassment for boxing because with UFC fucking smashing  their front door in this is the last thing they needed.  Another just right.  Another shitty pay-per-view event.  Another like.  Booing.  What?  But Merchant's going to start fighting people.  I got to watch every boxing match now. 
[01:47:30]  Finds a DeLorean maybe.  Yeah Larry Merchant he's what is he a salesman or something?  Ah chip.  What happened?  You know.  Something like that.  I actually first thing I thought it was Jay Moore when there was a problem with Larry  Merchant.  I'm thinking of Jay Moore.  I can't think of Larry Merchant when I'm thinking of Jay Moore.  That's what I said.  Yeah.  I didn't even hear Larry Merchant.  I thought it was Jay Moore's.  Mayweather was just trying to fight him again.  It's bullshit since it doesn't take talent to knock out a guy unguarded.  But true.  It wasn't like.  Ortiz was stupid to keep his arms down at that point and then to look over to the ref. 
[01:48:00]  I would agree with that if it was in the fight and they had broken and then they were  boxing and then Ortiz put his arms down and just turned away and looked at the crowd.  But I would agree with that because to me that's totally dropping your guard.  But in this moment everybody knew it was happening.  It is weird on a lot of levels.  Everybody knew what was going on.  You could tell by Ortiz because his arms were completely down by his side that he did not  know that the fight was going to resume that second.  He felt like he was backing off waiting for the ref to get in the middle do the chop and 
[01:48:30]  then they he felt like the ref didn't restart the fight properly.  OK fine.  But then he made the mistake of assuming that the ref realized he didn't restart the fight  properly and looked over at him.  That was the dumbest thing he could have done.  Mayweather of course again you know.  I think it was a comedy of errors.  They're all hyped up.  Of course Mayweather is going to take that right at that point.  Of course he is.  And then maybe Mayweather should have you know gave it another second and let you know 
[01:49:00]  Ortiz back up a little more.  But he admitted he did something dirty.  Kenny was right.  Like if he didn't do anything that we're all going what the fuck was that.  He would have said the fight started.  But he didn't say he's a protect yourself at all times because he knew the guy wasn't  ready.  It's like we have another Mayweather Ortiz fight in the in the future.  Huh.  But will anybody even give a shit.  I mean another one of those black marks on fucking boxing.  Right.  Where people just go oh this fucking sport is just so corrupt and dumb and fucking.  It's fucking great.  Yeah.  Couldn't have happened. 
[01:49:30]  I'm so happy that it happened that way just for UFC.  Yeah.  So now there's a Pacquiao fight which I'm sure people will watch.  But I just love the fact that UFC is fucking being seen as more and more relevant in boxing.  It's still not in New York man.  It's still not in New York.  That's all union shit.  That will change.  Eventually that will change.  Should have changed by now.  Instant feedback Matt W.  Check out Larry Merchant attacks fan on YouTube.  What?  Larry Merchant attacks fan?  What's wrong with Larry Merchant?  He's fucking out of his mind. 
[01:50:00]  Ding ding.  Larry Vodka Breath Merchant.  I was winning this fight.  He was robbed.  My miracle.  Excuse me folks.  I'm not used to using any strong arm tactics to get my interviews in.  Would you want to fight him again?  That was it.  Larry shoved that guy away though. 
[01:50:30]  Look at Larry's face man.  Larry's a fucking.  He's an animal.  He must have been.  Look at his teeth clenched.  He must have been a bad ass motherfucker.  Vodka Breath Larry.  Did he ever drink?  I mean did he ever fight?  I don't know.  Was he a fighter at one point?  Or was he just a.  I don't know.  Jesus Christ.  What is he from Venice or something?  Looked like Judge Smales.  Yeah.  Get out of my ring Danny.  Wow that's pretty good.  It's from Venice.  He's a merchant.  I'm a merchant of Venice. 
[01:51:00]  Oh chip.  He's a former.  He's a sports writer.  Oh okay.  Yeah.  I do like the fact that Mayweather said you ain't shit.  And you don't have shit on boxing.  They should fire you.  They should fire you.  And then Larry got all like.  Bah.  Fuck you.  Let's hear that again going into break.  I wish he would have said to him.  But I do give you a fair shake.  I thought what you did was dirty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm being honest.  Let's listen to that again.  That was too good man.  Yeah.  But I also like what Larry said to him. 
[01:51:30]  Because Floyd is a promoter.  We had him on.  If you remember he's just completely promoting.  But like he goes I'm talking to you now as a prize fighter.  Prize fighter.  You don't hear guys saying that.  A prize fighter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't call him that.  He's 80 years old.  Larry Merchant in the old days.  Yeah.  We like Mayweather don't we?  He was a very.  He wasn't very forthcoming in the interview.  He had the sunglasses on.  But again.  He's a fighter.  He's not used to get up at fucking six in the morning to talk to a room full of white  guys.  He was also promoting his big fight with the big show when we had him on. 
[01:52:00]  So it wasn't exactly.  I didn't like the fact that he had his big entourage with him in the room.  Oh that's right.  Yeah.  He was fine.  He was okay.  And then he canceled the next time.  He just didn't want to get up.  He canceled all his morning press.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Who's the other guy we have on?  A lot.  What do you mean?  The other fighter.  Bernard Hopkins.  Yeah.  Hopkins.  I saw Bernard at the UFC in Philly and he, I have such low self esteem.  I never think they'll remember me, but he's like, yeah, I was right.  How's the show?  And like, he was, that's cool. 
[01:52:30]  He's great, man.  Here's the Larry merchant thing again.  For you.  It was just an automatic response.  Let's get on with the fight.  Let's protect yourself at all time.  He done something dirty.  We're not here to cry and complain about what he did dirty or what I did dirty.  I was victorious.  If he wanted a rematch, he can get a rematch.  You were in charge of the fight.  You were aggressive and trying and taking advantage of what you saw as a flaw.  You know what I'm going to do?  Because you don't ever give me a fair shake. 
[01:53:00]  You know that?  So I'm going to let you talk to Victor Ortiz, all right?  I'm through.  They put somebody else up and give me an interview.  What are you talking about?  You heard him.  You never give me a fair shake.  HBO needs to fire you.  You don't know shit about boxing.  You ain't shit.  You're not shit.  I wish I was 50 years younger and I'd kick your ass.  You won't do shit.  Get the fuck out of here.  Larry Merchant, ready to get in the ring 50 years younger.  Kick his ass.  You should have taken a shot right there.  But Mayweather did say, you still ain't doing shit. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, he said that at the end?  Oh, that's great.  All right.  Steven Wright's up next.  And Tony Bennett at 840 this morning.  You know, I got the song he did with Amy Winehouse.  You want to hear a little of that?  Going in a break?  All that money's going to the Winehouse Foundation thing?  That's right.  For that one song?  Yeah.  Yeah.  For the iTunes single and video.  Oh.  That's right.  Wow.  Tony Bennett.  That's right.  He's been avoiding us for years.  And it finally is going to happen.  I wonder why.  Literally walking on the other side of the street, crossing the street to avoid you. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  We're talking about the old walkover.  Yeah.  We would see him on a regular basis and we'd try to get him on mic and he would always avoid  us.  All of a sudden he would just make beelines for alleyways.  He would cross the street.  He would do anything to not talk to us.  He's a big fan of mine, too.  It's so odd that he wouldn't talk to us.  No, he's not.  Tony Bennett and Amy Winehouse.  My heart is sad and lonely. 
[01:54:30]  For you I sigh for you, dear, only.  Why haven't you seen it?  I'm all for you, body and soul.

Do you like  Look at it like  Oh fuck yeah  Okay that I can relate to  I can't  I look at  I can't believe  What his mind  Is producing  I just can't believe  That he's writing the show  Editing the show 
[02:05:00]  Directing the show  And then doing these  Giant stand up shows  That he's writing  And producing  It's just  Mind blowing to me  I mean there's no one else  Other than Woody Allen  That does that  Right  And he doesn't edit  The thing  I mean  Or do you stand up?  There's like three  There's like three  There's such a few  Amount of people  And he's like  I don't  I admire him  His brain is unbelievable  You're saying  He's an overachiever  I hate overachievers  We all hate the overachiever  Louie's a guy  Like you look at  Like he took all these years 
[02:05:30]  To get there  And it's like  This is what somebody does  When they take all those years  To get there  They're just a fucking animal  Yep  And it's like  He's doing everything  To make sure that  Nobody else fucks it up  It's like I love the fact  That he can do that  You relax  What's that?  A little down time maybe  No but he knows  This is the time  He's hit his time right now  And he's smart man  He's fucking doing  Taking advantage of it  Absolutely man  Absolutely  It's what he should be doing  Absolutely  And he can write and direct  And it's like  Most of us can't edit  I can't edit  I don't know how to direct  An episode  The sitcom I'm writing 
[02:06:00]  It's really funny  It's like the wacky neighbor  Comes over every time  And it turns out  He's a paroled rapist  And he always has blood  On the front of his pants  And it's never explained  And ABC wants me  To write him out  And you refuse to  And that's where the problem is  I refuse to  You have your values  You have your values  And you're sticking to them  Exactly  Stephen Wright's in studio  Playing the Calvin Theater  Northampton, Massachusetts  This weekend I would assume  Oh that's cool  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday  Friday you're playing  Right Stephen? 
[02:06:30]  Very good  How was your weekend?  Dates are at  StephenWright.com by the way  Yeah  How was your weekend?  It was alright  I was in Detroit two nights ago  Yeah  And the only thing weird was  You know I'm a Red Sox fan of course  This is very rare for me  I don't know what happened yesterday  In the game  I don't know if they won or lost  Because I came here  And I couldn't check into the hotel  Because it wasn't ready  And I went around  And no one's playing the Red Sox  Tampa game on the TV 
[02:07:00]  So I was in this bubble  He has a smartphone?  Oh you still don't know  I have like a wooden phone  Oh I'm sorry  He actually really wants us to know  It was  I thought by now you found out  Oh okay  The Rays beat them 8-5  Yeah  Yeah yeah  You guys are in trouble  You got like two games  Into the wild card spot there  You're in a little trouble  I guess  You're four behind the Yankees  Well the Yankees are not thinking about the Yankees 
[02:07:30]  But they're going to play the Yankees this weekend right?  Yeah that should be a very fun interesting  Because it is an opportunity for you know  Get that full  I like getting that full game up you know  Like that half a game stuff annoys me  It's like oh you split it  This guy this team won  That team won  It's only a half game up  And shit like that  I like full game bam  Team wins  Full game up  Do you go to games?  I go to a couple of games a year 
[02:08:00]  I've went once in the last 10 or 15 years  I never go  Why?  I just  I find that most sports  Just the way they treat fans  Like they  I just hate them  Jimmy used to be a huge Yankees fan  Huge fan  And we watched that change drastically  In front of our eyes the last five years  He now hates  Hates sports in general  The majority of athletes I've met  I've despised  Not all of them  Some of them are great guys  And a lot of them  Again they do charity work  And I'm just a fucking needy fanboy  Who wants a picture  So I'm the problem  It was the Derek Jeter incident 
[02:08:30]  That's turned me  But since then there's been so many  All the Yankees that night were dicks  Derek Jeter refused to take a picture with Jimmy  But then would take pictures with every good looking girl  Every hot girl  No no no  I didn't want him to not take a picture  I wanted him to sign a photo of me and him  I had taken a picture with the ones  I had a photo of me and him  And he just refused to sign it  You went up to him and he said no  Three times  He said the word  He goes I'm busy right now  He was just being a jerk off  But Stephen it's not that crazy  He had three different disguises  So I told you that he didn't realize  It was Jimmy every time  I even dressed up like Billy Martin 
[02:09:00]  He's like hey get that windshield out of here  Get that head on my head  Because he was killed in a car  I wouldn't think he would be like that  That was not how I would think he is  I know I didn't either  He seemed like a very nice charitable guy at the event  He was very talkative  Yeah  And then  He just didn't like me  It's okay it happens  I think the biggest problem that night  Was the fact that you approached him  Near the bathroom  No I didn't  No  Near the stage  The first time was by the  The third time was by the stage 
[02:09:30]  The second time was outside the bathroom  And the first time was like  I guess I should have paid to have it signed  Because it was a charity event  But I wasn't thinking of that  I wasn't trying to get something to sell  And I would have paid a hundred bucks  To have him sign it for charity  I just wasn't thinking  I didn't know I could do that  Oh that would have worked  Maybe yeah  But then the girls  They just fucking  That's what  Whatever they wanted  Dirt you  Yeah  That's Derek Cheater's line of people  That he can get laid with  Yeah  And you didn't fit into that criteria  Yes I did  He just didn't want to  I would have fucked up for an autograph 
[02:10:00]  Boy has needs  Yeah I'm sure  Why not  And then Stephen  Just so you know  Me and Jimmy  Were at the Brooklyn Diner  And Randy Johnson walked by  So he ran  After Randy Johnson  With his camera  I had the camera  Oh yeah  And Randy  Right on the streets of New York  Denied him a photograph  And he went to  All the Yankee  But I asked him for a picture with him  It wasn't of him  Like I'm a paparazzi  I'm like can I get a picture with him  He's like no thank you  He said no thank  Who says no thank you 
[02:10:30]  He ran across the street  Like fucking Jerry Lewis did  In The King of Comedy  When Masha was chasing him  And then who  Looking over his shoulder  Who just blew me off this weekend  This big tall fucking ugly basketball player  Oh Chris Bosh  Chris Bosh  That giant creep  In his awful pituitary gland voice  Fuck him  What happened  Fashion week  Is he on a New York team  No he's on Miami  He's with the heat  But he happened to be in the hotel  Nobody was bothered  He was like with a publicist  Or whatever  Ah sorry 
[02:11:00]  Ah  Can we fucking  Wait a minute  Is that how he talks  Yeah he's horrendous  He sounds like Brock Peters  When he's crying in the incident  If anybody saw that  Yeah  Yeah  Did you tell him  That's how he said it  No I just  I just stood there  You go back  You leave  And then walk back  Tell him that's  Yeah by the way  Yeah  That's you  Shithead  You ever see the incident  Of course he didn't  Why would he  He doesn't know Martin Sheer  Or Tony Massanti's work 
[02:11:30]  Now Steven  You don't follow the Pats  Until what  Baseball's over  Or are you a football fan  I just  I started getting into it  About three years ago  That's it  Yeah because I  It just was always  Baseball baseball  But being all that stuff  They did  It just kept  Seeping in  You know  And I started watching it  And so I got  All these years  So I watched it yesterday  Yeah  All these years  You never watched football  I never watched football  And in the 80's  I never watched basketball  So all those great Celtics teams  All those teams  I had not 
[02:12:00]  I just knew that  They were winning and stuff  But I wouldn't watch the game  It didn't interest me  All these years  I assumed you were just  A big Boston sports fan  Across the board  Just baseball  Just Red Sox  And hockey  During the  Bobby Orr days  Wow  Yeah  I was in that store  Where I got this coffee  Remember last time  I was here  I went in there  And they told me  About the Stanley Cup  And everything  Did you go see it?  Nothing  Yeah I did  Oh good  I did  But this time  I was in there  And nothing happened  Nothing going on 
[02:12:30]  You had your hopes up  For all born pens  I don't know  If I should go back  And talk to the management  You need something  Going on all the time  Yeah I was here  Three months ago  In the end  It's just a store  Unless the Stanley Cup  Is hanging on there  No but you kind of  Look forward to it  Like maybe that's the place  Where magic happens  Yeah that's how it was  In my head  I was in there  Like nothing  Yeah who's here  What's the event  What's the event  Just coffee and a croissant  Coming up to someone  And asking me the event  Yeah well come on  Come on you know 
[02:13:00]  Come me  Give me this guy  So you're not Bruins really  I mean they obviously  You know  Won but  Just watch that  Playoffs this year  Just let me watch this  And I got sucked in  And watch that  But just baseball  What are you  Or what are you  I used to be  A big basketball fan  Was my main one  But I don't follow  The Knicks that much anymore  I'm starting to take a peek again  Love hockey  And love football  And I used to be  A big time Mets fan  I haven't been to a game  In years  Oh  You don't follow it 
[02:13:30]  Much either  Nope  Not really  Just from a distance  Really  But I'm all about  The Jets and the Islanders  You know  And even though  They've had some bad  Bad years  I still am all in there  Mixed martial arts  I watch a lot  Oh yeah  And UFC  Getting into the UFC  Yeah I love it  UFC is getting good  I used to fight  A little too violent  I don't follow  Yeah it's just  Boxing  No  Guys beating the shit  Out of each other  Match was the other night  Right  Yeah  What happened 
[02:14:00]  Oh boy  Controversial ending  Oh it was  Yeah  Oh yeah  Yeah  No it was  They had a  Headbutt  And then when they were  Going to hug  To make up  Or whatever  The Floyd Mayweather  Just kind of  Popped them  As they were  Coming out of  The hug clinch  And technically  It was legal  But it was kind of  A shitty unsportsmanlike thing  Who headbutted who  Ortiz headbutted  Floyd Mayweather  And Mayweather  Was not happy about it  Here's the actual clip  If you want to take a look  And see it  Because it's like 
[02:14:30]  They're hugging  Because they  You watch him headbutt him  Like  He dove at him  Like  Oh  Big headbutt  That's a nasty  Dirty fucking headbutt  And I think he just got caught up  Because you don't think  You're going to get away with that  Now the ref calls time  He apologized  And  He said he was sorry  Now he's penalizing  He loses a point  He loses a point  Headbutt point  Now watch  They touch gloves  The ref's supposed to start the fight  Back up properly I guess  So he puts him over in a corner  And I think he's trying to keep him apart 
[02:15:00]  He didn't really  Stun him  They hug  And bam  He backs off  Isn't that hilarious  I find it hilarious  But now that I'm looking at it again  The ref put him in separate corners  And the ref now assuming  Okay now  Go fight again  And Ortiz  Went over to touch gloves again  Yeah  It's just a weird ending  Over apologetic  People will be discussing this for a while  Yeah  He knocked him out  Oh yeah  He knocked him out  That was it  The championship fight  Just looks bad for boxing 
[02:15:30]  Yeah  It's almost like  If they went to see a stand-up show  And the comic did like  Fucking 25 minutes  And then unraveled  And walked off  Started throwing glass  Yeah  Fuck it  Don't get me  Drunk and crying at the audience  Kicking people's glasses  On the table  In front of them  I'd watch that  Yeah  Stepping on their chicken wings  Have you ever had a violent incident  Or no?  On the stage  No  Never after  No  I had an ashtray thrown at me  Like early 90s  But  Yeah  From the audience right to the stage 
[02:16:00]  Yeah  He apologized after  Were you smoking?  Was it a courtesy?  Hit behind me  Yes  He was trying to help me  He apologized  Afterwards  Did he explain  Like what  Why he did that  And then thinking back  He shouldn't have done it  Did he break it down at all?  Or did he just say  I'm sorry  Through that  I was teasing him  He kept talking  So I kept calling him gay  And that's what you do in 1991  When you're brand new  And someone talks  What are you gay?  Talking about dicks  You know  I wasn't very good  And then he picked up an ashtray 
[02:16:30]  He dumped it  I'll never forget  He dumped it  And he threw it  But it was plastic  And it hit the wall behind me  And I just kept doing the show  I goofed on him or whatever  And then after he goes  Oh sorry about that  Not like one of those  Big metal old storks club ashtrays  Yeah  Could it rip your head off?  No no no  It wasn't like one of those  Heavy glass ones  That you really want to  Brain somebody with  Can you look at a heavy ashtray  Without wondering  What it would feel like  Hitting someone's skull?  I can't  A murder weapon  It really is  When you go in the store  And buy you  You look at it  How many people could I kill? 
[02:17:00]  A nice fucking heavy  Thick glass ashtray  You can just  Careen off the back  Of somebody's head  I give the guy credit  For apologizing  But you know  I don't know  It's kind of like  Steven was saying  What does he just come up  And go like  Hey I was a dick  Yeah we both knew  What happened  He's like  Sorry about that  You know  I'm surprised  He didn't get removed  From the establishment  It was a gig in Lodi New Jersey  Oh okay  I've thrown shit  Into the audience  Yeah yeah  You should  Start heaving stuff  But you don't come across 
[02:17:30]  As a comic  That probably has a lot  Of controversy going on  With the audience  Like people aren't  Yelling shit at you  No  You don't get  Heckled a lot  In the early days  In the club days  I wouldn't get heckled  But just  People would talk  They'd just be rude  They'd be rude  You know  They're on and on  And I hadn't  I couldn't like  Banter with  They say this  I say  I couldn't do that  Everything I ever said  Was written in my head before  Uh huh  So I would ignore them  Ignore  Just ignore them  Ignore them  And if they kept doing it  I didn't know what else to do  I would just turn and go  Fuck you  And the whole place would laugh 
[02:18:00]  Because I haven't sworn  The entire set  And then it worked  Every time  But that was  That was my solution  It never ceases to amaze me  Though  When I go to a comedy show  And to realize  That people  Think it's a whole  Another form of  Of interactive entertainment  Just sit there  Enjoy the show  And then they feel  They feel like  You're doing something wrong  The comic  When you're telling them 
[02:18:30]  Hey  I'm doing a show here  How about you shut up  You don't go to  Fucking Broadway show  And start blurting out  You know  Hey sing that song  Fucking phantom  Yeah I was gonna say  Like you know  One thing about doing  The comedy  Is to like  Have them feel like  They're  You're talking exactly  To them  You are  But it's like  Like a conversation  I'm talking to you  And some people  Get it mixed up  Like well I can talk back  To him  Talk back  No  And like the play thing  That's a perfect analogy 
[02:19:00]  If you're watching a play  And someone's  Going over  And putting a glass  Across the table  Put it back  Put the glass back  Fuck you  You know  That happens  Yeah yeah  Get the bottle  It's just really  One form of entertainment  And where again  The person  That you're  You're chastising  For blurting out  Some drunken babble  Feels insulted  That you  You are actually  Telling them  In front of a group  Of people  To shut the fuck up 
[02:19:30]  What's worse  Stunning  What's worse than the guy  Who has to defend  His mouthy broad  There's nothing worse  Than that  It's like  Don't fucking try  To be a man  In front of me  When you can't  Shut your fucking date up  That's the worst  They can't control  Their date  So they get mad  At you for crucifying her  Fucking horrible  And you are  By the way  A pro at that  It's honestly  It's just enraging  Because there's  Such a lack of  When they're  There's such a lack  Of respect  What they're doing  It's like  We know what they're doing  Sometimes the audience  Thinks we're being too harsh 
[02:20:00]  But when they're being aggressive  And they're trying to  Derail your set  Like different  It's different than  When they're just  Trying to be fun with you  Yeah  The only  What's the word  Recourse  Recourse  Yeah  Is to  Is to humiliate them  And boy  Does Jimmy do a great job  Of humiliating  I was gonna say  You do that  Unbelievable  I think any comic  Could though  Any comedian  Who really wants  To hurt their feelings  Could  I mean you know  I've seen it where  Where you know  The guy  Again his mouthy chick  Is blurting shit out 
[02:20:30]  So he's gotta jump  On the bandwagon  To defend her  And then by  What Jimmy says  About the girl  Fucks both of them up  Like you don't wanna hear  Anyone talking about  Your girl like that  Good for you  The best is that  Stunned silence afterwards  What's better  No crowd  No just a fucking  Office loud mouth  That asshole  Who's funny  Around chub insurance  He's fucking hilarious  And he thinks  He's gonna be funny  In front of his date  And his friends  And impress them  Like fucking with you 
[02:21:00]  Chub insurance  Oh fuck  And then you bury him  And it's just so satisfying  Such a satisfying feeling  Cause you know  He wants to fucking  He wants to wreck your night  Oh yeah  So he can go out  And tell his friends  Like here I fucking  Shut him up  Yeah  He resents you  You should've been there  You should've seen what I did  Really  Are you doing any acting  You're a good actor man  I'm acting during the day  When I walk down the street  Oh yeah  That's all  It's just all an act  No just  Stand up right now  Do you 
[02:21:30]  When you  Like when I don't act  For a while  I kind of wanna get something  And then when I'm doing it  I'm like oh yeah  I'm terrible at this  This is why I haven't been doing it  You're good at it  You should be doing more  Thanks  Thanks  I always feel like  When I watch it  I always think it's  It's not as smooth  As I want it  Like I can tell  I'm like a little  Up nervous  Like you know what I mean  What are you doing  You're nervous  Like when I even saw  The Louis thing  I was like  It was alright  But it was like  I just was more casual 
[02:22:00]  I can tell I'm not  As casual as I really am  What does your tell  Like we all have a tell  Or something  When we're nervous  Like what is your  What is your tell  It just looked  Slightly off  Like if it was  If it was really me  And the acting  Was a stencil  It was like  It's like  Off like that  You know what I mean  Right  It's just like  Just a little  Not like  What the hell is he doing  But just  And maybe people  Didn't even notice  But I noticed  No I don't think  People notice  You think so 
[02:22:30]  Yeah I think it's  But that's a normal reaction  I think we all feel that  You're so super critical  Whenever you watch  Your film  And shit like that  No I thought  You were great on Louis  How do you get  I thought  I thought  I came across casual  How do you get comfortable  In front of a camera  It's so hard to be  Acting is fucking hard man  Yeah  It's really hard to be  Completely relaxed  And comfortable  And fluid  And the oddest part of it is  You're doing it  In front of a camera  Every day  When you go through life  That's what you want  It to look like  When you're acting  So you're practicing 
[02:23:00]  All the time  All the time  On how to act great  I'm the greatest actor  In the world  When a camera isn't rolling  I'm so natural  As soon as that camera  Light goes on  You're just like  I don't know  What do you do  With the hands  Your facial expressions  Like sometimes  I'll watch  A really good actor  And it'll be in a scene  Where not only  Is he delivering  His lines authentically  But like there's  Maybe a little  A smirk of the mouth  Or kind of an eyebrow raise 
[02:23:30]  Or just some quick  Little facial expression  That's like  Did he think about that  Was it written in  That he was supposed  To do that  Is it something  That just happens  Like in natural life  But to sit there  And think about it  Is almost like  Thinking about every  Aspect of a golf swing  You can't do that  You gotta just know  What all the pieces  Are put together  And then you have  A nice natural golf swing  When I talk  You talk naturally  You trip on your words  Sometimes when you act  I feel like I can't  Get all the words out  Yeah  It's weird 
[02:24:00]  It's like you said  They're doing it  All the time  And then the camera's there  And then you  Have trouble doing it  It's just really weird  And I don't try to act  Like another guy  I'm just trying to  You know  Just act like you  Right  How would I say this  Can you imagine  Have trouble  I'm having trouble  Saying it  How I would say it  Yeah  I guess that's why  People are always  Doing things like  We want a  Stephen Wright type  Not Stephen  We need a Stephen Wright 
[02:24:30]  Type of person  It's like  Well I'm the guy  But like I'm sitting here  Sometimes I'll catch myself  Like alright  In real life  I'm talking right now  My stomach does not look good  In my UFC shirt  My right hand is hanging off  My chair  My left hand is on  And I'm not moving that much  And I'm watching Stephen listen  And I'm watching  He's not moving  No one moves when they listen  You're just kind of still  And you listen  But it's like  If I had to listen on camera  My eyes are open wide  Listening  Listening  Listening  Listening  I hear you  I hear you  I hear you  You're nodding your head  Mr. Fabi-Sham 
[02:25:00]  Oh  Look I forget that a camera  Is capturing my image  I act like it's fucking Polaroids  And I have to act out each moment  It's so fucking hard man  To get  What did you say about Polaroids  I'm acting away  I forget that a motion picture camera  Picks up subtleties  I'm acting like it's Polaroid photos  Being taken  One  One picture at a time  It's so  It's great  It's so difficult  To relax  And you seem like  Maybe because you know yourself 
[02:25:30]  Obviously  But you seem to be like  You're never nervous  I've never seen anything you've done  Where I think  He's chill  Yeah man  You always look comfortable  You're good at hiding  Sometimes I'm alright  And sometimes I'm nervous  But you can't tell I am  Like I mean  People think I'm just completely  Like I mean  I'm relaxed right now  But sometimes I can be like  This and there's a car accident  In my head  And from the outside  You don't see that  Are you  I don't know why that is  You must be a good poker player 
[02:26:00]  Oh fuck  He has no tells  This guy  Yeah  You can't tell if he has  Three aces  Or there's been a death  In the family  There it is  Bravo  Are you a yeller at all  Because again  I've never seen you  Get angry  I mean  But they always say  Well quiet  Steady guys  Do you yell in your  Personal life at all  Yeah  Like something  Yeah  Something goes wrong  Like I spilled some coffee  On the kitchen  Just say  Oh Jesus fuck  So it comes out  A weird 
[02:26:30]  Yeah  Or you know  If someone  Something in the sports game  You know  Bottom of the night  The guy hits a thing  I mean  I won't just go  Oh amazing  Oh yeah  But no  People don't see it  Because  They normally see  I'm just trying  To do my act  And stuff  But the difference is  You recover quickly  Oh that goes right back  Yeah a lot of us  We lose our fucking minds  And then  For me  It takes forever  To get back  To some kind of normal  So you  It looks like  It would drop  Right back to normal 
[02:27:00]  Yeah it goes  Pretty quick  Pretty quickly  His anger comes out  Like a laughing box  It just pops out  Real quick  You'll have to be  110 that way  Because you're not  Fucking constantly  Stranding yourself  Screaming at people  What did I get angry  What about you  What about you  It's just  It's non-stop  What the anger  It's constant  It's like a fucking  It's like a security blanket  I don't know  I'm afraid without it  I'll be like  As they say  The hole in the donut  What annoyed  Jimmy holds a grudge  Like the JDL  It eats away at Jimmy  I was walking 
[02:27:30]  Even as a kid  Like in like  Junior high  Yeah I think so  It's just  I don't  I don't know  I don't handle it well  I was walking  Yesterday right  I'm walking  From the comedy cellar  Back to my car  And I see a cab  Stopped in the middle  Of the street  And he was letting  People out  And there's a green light  And this scumbag  Didn't pull over  To let people pass  Like you could have  Just pulled over  And let them out  But I'm walking by  And the rage  Is building up  And I'm like  I'm not even driving  What the fuck  Do I care for  Why am I angry  About this 
[02:28:00]  Yeah  But I really am  Getting viciously angry  At that piece of shit  And I know technically  I'm right  Like he probably  Should be killed  In some sort of  Tribal thing  Should be killed  This is real  Stephen  But it's so rude  What he's doing  But why do I  Kenny taught me  He's like  Why do you allow it  To affect you  And I don't know  I admire that  I wish I wasn't  Like that  I get pissed  When I'm walking  And I see somebody  Doing a fucked up  Driving thing  Because I drive around  In Manhattan so much  That I  It pisses me off  To look and go  I would be so pissed  If I was behind 
[02:28:30]  That guy right now  Yeah  I'd be so mad  And I look at him  Like yeah  You fucking asshole  Even though  You're not behind  Even though  I'm just walking  I am actually  A pedestrian that day  And uh  That's amazing  Like there are people  That um  They stand  Off the sidewalk  In the crosswalk  Knowing that people  Can squeak by  And make the left turn  Or something like that  But they'll just  Stand there  Like  Waiting for the green  You know  You can cross thing  And I  It infuriates me  I want to walk up to him 
[02:29:00]  And go  Do you know you're standing  In an active lane of traffic  Get on the sidewalk  How about I drive  On this fucking sidewalk man  And just mow you down  Yeah things like that  Annoy me  Especially driving things  Are you a beeper  Road rage  When you drive  No very rarely  Very rarely  Like if somebody's  Kind of just sitting  At the green  You're just kind of like  Ah come on  If it  It has to go  A certain length  You know  Not immediately  That's true  Jimmy is  I'm  He's right 
[02:29:30]  Stephen's right  That's the way  Jimmy is  Immediate  You mean that  Like when Ali  Used to say  He can shut the light off  And be in the bed  Before you work  It's like that  With the traffic light  With you  That's Norton  Before the red  Is completely  To the human  Like they have  A Nova special  And seeing the red  Go down  You are already  Oh yeah  Jimmy's bad  I give a second  That's coming for me too man  He's bad  Because I'm 5'6 
[02:30:00]  If I was 6'8  Literally  My response time now  Is horrible  But I also know  I can get the shipping  Out of me pretty easily  Yeah  If I was a little bit bigger  Here's how it would go  And I want the tink  Tink is the light change  Yeah  Tink  And it's irrational  It's stupid  If you know it's irrational  Then why  Right  I don't know  Knowledge is no defense  As they say  I will beep very quickly 
[02:30:30]  If I've been behind someone  That's driving slow  Or like an asshole  And they're stopping  And fucking up  And it's like the second light  And the first light  They screwed up at  And didn't go fast enough  And I gave them a little time  Yeah  You have a cliff board  Yeah yeah  I mark it down  And go okay  The blue Chevy  I beep at him  But the guy  The guy in the white Ford  I'm going to give him  A little break  And arrows  Arrows  No mercy  The second that fucking arrow turns  And I could be  Four or five cars back  Meh 
[02:31:00]  Because I don't want to be  The guy that's stuck now  Waiting for the next arrow  Because some idiot  That's at the lead  If you're at the lead  You've got to pay attention  Especially at an arrow  You know how valuable an arrow is  I hear you  He's this  You're the worst  Go ahead  No no no go  No it's just  He's dying over there  Steven Wright  He just doesn't understand this  It's the anger I feel  This is the worst  When someone's going slow  When they're fucked up  And you beep at them  And then you see them  They put their hand up  Like ah  What are you beeping at  What's the hurry 
[02:31:30]  We're all in this together  Have you ever been  First in line at the light  And it turns green  And someone beeped at you  Has that ever happened  All the time  Really  Whoever I'm with  I'll go you know what  They're right  No  Absolutely  Do you really  Fuck yeah  I've been lollygagging  In the left lane  And gotten honked at  And I move over  And I'll tell someone I'm with  Boy I fucking deserve that  Didn't I  But you still gotta go  Fuck your mother  I get annoyed  But I know I'm wrong 
[02:32:00]  Yeah  Really  Yes  I'm so paranoid  Of being the guy  I never want to be the guy  So I'm constantly looking  At lights  Making sure  If I'm the first one  On the light  I'm looking at it  Like a fucking  Top fuel dragster  At the Christmas tree  Just waiting  Green button  And I go  Yeah but I've been  I've been fucked up before  So I have to realize  That  Can you  Sit there  And we're gonna put  Tony Bennett here  Because he's coming in now  You know Tony Bennett  Stay  Yeah I can 
[02:32:30]  Of course  Can I  Wait a minute  You just asked me  If I could move  So Tony Bennett  Could sit in here  And I'm not on acid  Okay  Yes  Who wants you to stay  He's gonna come in  And be like  Yeah those fucking  People at the lights  I hate when it's green  A couple more minutes  They said Roland  Is getting him now  Well that's what he says  And then he texted  Yeah but the guy's  85 years old  It's gonna take him  A little time  To get that  Nah he's pretty spry  I've seen him  Walking down the street  Yeah we've seen him  We've seen him run  To the other side  Of the street  When we were walking  This guy's avoided us 
[02:33:00]  For years Stephen Wright  And we don't know why  This is his first time  In here  Yeah we used to broadcast  On the streets of New York  From one studio  To the other  And we would always  Just see him every day  And we would try  To get him on mic  And he would  And freak out  And like cross the street  When he shouldn't be  Crossing the street  How would you see him  Every day  I don't know man  I guess that was his routine  Whatever he was doing  It's like where's Tony  Going every day  That's the same place  Yeah he lives  Or works in Midtown  He's probably going  Running or something  He's always like  A sweatsuit or something  Yeah  Yeah he's up there  On a fucking I-beam 
[02:33:30]  He's in the gym every morning  Oh he's going to the gym  Thanks Kenny  His gym was on  West 56th street  Geez really  Amazing  Guy still working out  At that age  How creepy is that  That he just walked in  And knew that  I know  Kenny just knew  Where he was going  He would do 200 sit ups  That's just creepy  That he walked in the studio  He lived in the area  Probably around  Central Park somewhere  And that Radu gym  On West 56th street  Was his gym  What's that  His dossier  You have in your hand 
[02:34:00]  Use that one  Creep  Because Steven's  Going to be moving over there  And Steve I understand  He doesn't like talking  Into something  Right after someone else  I respect that  Oh yeah I would too  I'm kind of like that too  Like I don't like to fucking  Talking to a mic  Right after somebody else  Kenny has really bad breath  Is what Jimmy's saying  No not at all  Kenny's fresh and clean  Literally  I don't like talking  Into a mic  After anybody else does  For a second  So it's like  It's a courtesy  If someone's going to  Move over there  You don't want someone  Blabbing into it right before  Oh now see  This is the guy  You don't want talking  What are we doing now  They're walking now  We'll move Steven 
[02:34:30]  Is Roland walking him up  Let me do this  Roland's probably taking  Longer to walk  Than Tony is  Tony Benz  Walking down the hall  So why don't we  Take this opportunity  To say  Steven Wright's going to be  At the Calvin Theater  Northampton, Massachusetts  On Friday  And a bunch of other dates here  So go to  StevenWright.com  Atlantic City  In November  Very cool  November 4th  November 4th  And then the Pabst Theater  In Milwaukee  On October 6th  What do you do  Just 90 minutes  About yourself  Go up and do an hour  Well I do try 
[02:35:00]  I say 90 minutes  Worth of stuff  You know what I mean  Sometimes it's 78 minutes  Sure  That's great man  Because the laps  Is your order  Yeah  Can somebody help  Steven fix his chair  This poor bastard  He's trying to  It's like a fucking  It's a ladder chair  Who the fuck  Was in that chair last  A ladder chair  That's not comfortable  For a guest  Thank you  Jesus Christ  This place  Wow this is very exciting 
[02:35:30]  To have  Tony Bennett  Yeah  I guess he's got  Duets too  Yeah  He's coming out tomorrow  Yeah  We played one of the tracks  With Amy Winehouse  You ever get nervous  When you meet someone famous  Steven Wright  Sometimes  Like who  What  Who got to you  Oh  Johnny Carson  Bob Dylan  Big one  Bob Dylan's a huge one  That's a biggie too  Look at Tony Bennett  All class  All class  Mr. Bennett  Look at  He's got just  Dressed to the nines  Hi Tony  What a gentleman 
[02:36:00]  Good morning  Mr. Bennett  How are you  How are you  See you  Welcome to the show  Pleasure  Tony looks great  Yeah  You look great  Thanks so much  Like a million bucks  You know Steven Wright  Great comedian  Hey Tony  Nice to meet you  Pleasure to meet you  And that's Anthony  Anthony  Opie  Hey Tony  Young Sam  Pleasure to meet you sir  Jimmy Norton  Comedian extraordinaire  Yeah this is nice  Kind of small  We would have liked  A bigger studio  At some point  In our careers  Thinking we've been  Doing this for now  Almost you know  18 years together 
[02:36:30]  I like that it's intimate  You like the intimacy  Of it all  I do  I liked  Years ago  I started out  All entertainment  Was intimate  You know  Sure  Dean Martin  And Jerry Lewis  And Frank Sinatra  All the great artists  That when they first  Started out  We only worked in  Nightclubs  That had only  750 seats  It was  Liberace  Who said  I'd like to play  Madison Square Garden  And they said 
[02:37:00]  Are you crazy  And he tried it  And it worked  And every business  Executive ever since  Said  Wow what a business  Let's go into  Big stadiums  And the whole music  World changed  And entertainment  Changed  And the big studio  Big stadiums  Wow  Did you guys know  About Liberace  Back then  Like would you guys  Talk among yourselves  And go  You know I think  No he  Started off  You guys knew  Knew what  That he was gay  You know  Gay  What  Did you know he was gay 
[02:37:30]  Back then or no  What's  You're mumbling  What are you saying  Did you know Liberace  Was gay  Back in those days  Everybody knew  Oh they did know  Because the public  People  Actually he was a great  Piano player  You know  A lot of people  Didn't realize that  He was like highly  Competent  But people didn't  Know in the public  A lot of people  Had no idea  They just thought  He was flamboyant  I guess it was  Something people  In show business  All knew from  Being around him  I don't think  It was show business  I think  He was ahead of time  You know  Now it's  You know  Accepted  Right 
[02:38:00]  Someone is that way  Yeah  In those days  It was like  Wow  That's different  Your first hit  Was 1951  Like it's amazing  To me  That longevity  Like that was like  10 years before  The Beatles  12 years before  The Beatles  Like you've been  Famous for a long  Since the 50s  Wow  How much has  Vegas changed  Completely  Yeah  It was much  It was great  Originally  The Underworld  Built it with  The Mormons  And they owned  The Mormons  Own the land 
[02:38:30]  And the Underworld  Came in  And it was  By the Underworld  I mean Jewish  And Italian  Businessmen  And they  Invented this  Tremendous idea  And it worked  Right  Did you like  The way  The Underworld  Let's just say  The way they  Took care of  Talent  Compared  Absolutely  Much better  Than the big  Corporations  They are right  Yeah  The big corporations  Are big  But they're  They're 
[02:39:00]  They're  Uncreative  They  Everything has  To pay for itself  Like even the  Dining rooms  The rooms  Have to be  Filled up  And all that  Whereas  The Underworld  Was just  Pretty relaxed  About  Hey we're  Making a lot  Of money  You know  So let's  Just  Let everybody  Have a good  Time  Yeah  So do you  Miss those days  Telephones  Were free  All lunches  Were free  It was a  Very relaxed  Thing out there  I bet you got 
[02:39:30]  A lot more  Personal  Like service  As far as  I guess  I guess  Now  It's got  To go  Through channels  And management  And board  Of directors  And stuff  Where it  Probably in the  Old days  It was you know  One guy  Saying yeah  Sure  Make sure  Tony's got  That  Well you know  You're absolutely  Right  I mean I  Remember very  Clearly I was  Playing in a big  Nightclub there  And I wasn't  Doing business  It was before  My big record  Of San Francisco  And I felt so bad 
[02:40:00]  That I wasn't  Doing business  And I went to  The big boys  That own  The nightclub  And I said  I feel very bad  You don't have  To pay me  This week  They said  Get out of here  They said  Don't worry about it  We come in  We're listening  To you anyway  You know  There's just  A few people  And then  All of a sudden  My record hit  Of San Francisco  And it got packed  And everything  Like that  They were very nice  About you know  Come on  Just go and  Entertain  Don't worry about it  Now we may  Someday ask you  For a favor  This day may 
[02:40:30]  Never come  What's up  Jimmy  Jimmy goes  Huh  The mutin  Understand it  Bad Godfather  Reference  The music  Business back  Then too  It's like  Has that changed  For the better  Or the worse  Because it seems  Like artists  Are kind of  Harder to screw  Over now  Than they were  Back then  Like I think  Record companies  Took advantage  Of a lot of  Artists  Isn't it harder  To do now  Do you think  Like is it  Better for the  Artists now 
[02:41:00]  Or no  Well it's  Better financially  You're playing  Big stadiums  And everything  But  It's not as  Creative  The original  Music of the  50s and  Before the  50s  Was a  Tremendous  Era  When you get  To the  20s  30s  And 40s  Way before  My time  But you  You had  Irving  Berlin  Who was  Mr.  America  You had  George  Gershwin  You had  Cole Porter  Who was  Better than  Anybody  You had 
[02:41:30]  They came  Out of  Silent  Films  And when  Talkies came  In  You had  Fred Astaire  Introducing all  These great  Songs written  By those  Great men  And Broadway  There was  A higher  Level  Of great  Popular music  That  Will never  Go away  The corporation  Will say  Well that's  Old music  This is  New  We're going  To sell  You something  New  But it's  Not as  Good as  Those songs  Like  Night and  Day 
[02:42:00]  Or  They can't  Take that  Away from  Me  Or  Let's  Change  Partners  In  Dance  Those songs  Will last  Forever  They're part  Of  We've  Actually fed  That music  To everybody  I perform  All over  The world  In Asia  In Japan  In China  Australia  In Europe  And everyone  In the world  Loves the music  From the United  States  They love  Those songs  So that's  What we've  Contributed  To the world  No other 
[02:42:30]  Country's ever  Done that  No  I mean  What's  What's  The number  One song  In Germany  What's  The number  One song  In Norway  Yeah  Right  But  Our country  We just  Gave the  Greatest  Popular music  To the  World  And  People love  Us  For that  For that  Now are  You also  Because I  Get teased  A lot  But I'm  A legitimate  Lady Gaga  Fan  Like I  Like her  And I  Don't like  Her to be  Ironic  I really  Think she's  Good  And then  People have  Said that  You like  Her as  Well  I think 
[02:43:00]  She's  Fantastic  I met  A lot of  Performers  In my  Life  And there's  Something about  Her  That's  Very  Very  Intellectual  And very  Spontaneous  And very  Talented  She sings  Beautiful  She plays  Great piano  She knows  How to  Dance  But more  Than that  She reinvents  Herself  Only  Almost on a  Nightly  Basis  I've never  Seen that  Usually if  Someone is  Good  You say  Boy she's  Good  Or he's  Good  And they're  Good  And that's 
[02:43:30]  Who they  Are  She keeps  Changing  Herself  All the  Time  And she's  Very  Creative  And you  Did this  The CD  Coming out  Now  It's called  Duets 2  And it's  Available  Tomorrow  It's in  Stores  You can  Get it  On iTunes  And we  Played the  Single  Before  A great  Thing you  Did with  Amy Winehouse  Body and  Soul  She has  Such a  Great  Old  School  She had  A great  Old  School  Sound  It's not  Old  That's  Great  See  When you  Say old  I'm 
[02:44:00]  Telling you  That music  Is not  Old  It's  Great  And it's  Always  Going to  Be  Good  In other  words  If you  Hear  Nat  King  Cole  Today  Frank  Sinatra  They've  Been  Gone  For  22  Years  Now  Now  50  Years  From  Now  You'll  Listen  To  That  Record  It's  Not  Going  To  Sound  Old  Because  They  Did  It  Right  I  Should  Say  Maybe  Old  School  Is  The  Wrong  Way  To  Say  It  Is  It  Is  A  Wrong  Way  It's  More  I  Should  Say  A  Great  Classic  Or  Vintage  Sound  Like  You  Don't  Hear 
[02:44:30]  That  In  A lot  Of  Modern  Performers  That  Type  Of  Like  Billie  Holiday  Type  Of  She  Has  An  Old  Soul  Yeah  Maybe  That's  What  It's  An  Old  Soul  Possibly  Right  Yeah  I  Mean  Then  A  Complimentary  Was  It's  More  Intellectual  Music  Everybody  Knew  How  To  Read  Music  In  Those  Days  You  Know  There  Was  An  Army  Of  Musicians  That  All  Lost  Their  Jobs  And  Had  To  Become  Go  Into  Mathematical  Jobs  Of  Some  Kind  You  Know  Insurance  Salesman  Or  Something  Like  That  When  It  Changed 
[02:45:00]  It  Was  A  Major  Change  In  Music  And  For  The  Worst  Actually  Because  The  Music  Was  At  A  Bands  Of  Duke  Ellington  And  Count  Basie  And  Stan  Kenton  And  Woody  Herman  They  Had  Tremendous  Musicians  That  All  Really  Knew  How  To  Read  Music  Like  The  Back  Of  Their  Hand  And  They  Just  Understood  It  And  Now  It's  I  Asked  Jimmy  Durante  Many  Years  Ago  About  47  Years  Ago  I  Said  What  Do  You  Think  Of  Rock  And  Roll 
[02:45:30]  He  Said  Well  They  Play  Three  Chords  And  Two  Of  Them  Are  You  Did  You  Reach  Out  To  All  These  Artists  And  Say  That  You  Wanted  To  Play  With  Them  And  The  Response  Has  Got  To  Be  It's  Got  To  Make  You  Feel  Good  That  Everybody  In  The  Business  Wants  To  Work  With  You  Everybody  It's  A  Wonderful  Honor  My  Son  Was  Responsible  For  Creating  This  Album  And  He  Reached  Out  To  All 
[02:46:00]  Of  Them  And  They  Said  Yes  Let's  Do  It  We  Did  The  First  Album  A  Duets  Album  And  It  Sold  Millions  Of  Records  And  As  A  Result  Sony  Columbia  Just  Said  Come  On  You  Have  To  Do  Another  Album  Like  This  And  The  Second  Album  Is  Very  Promising  It's  Not  Even  Out  Yet  And  It's  Already  Number  One  On  Amazon  And  It's  Number  One  In  Spain  And  The  Netherlands  And  All  Over  Europe  And 
[02:46:30]  It's  Just  On  Pre-orders  That's  Without  People  Even  Hearing  On  The  Record  So  There's  Something  Very  Promising  About  It  I'm  Thrilled  You've  Been  Performing  Obviously  For  Many  Years  You  Still  Have  Such  A  Passion  For  These  Songs  Singing  Are  Are  There  Ever  Nights  Where  You're  Like  Oh  You  Know  I'm  Going to  San  Francisco  Again  Or  Do  You  Have  That  Strong  A  Passion  For  These  Songs  I'm  Surrounded  By  Just  Four  Great  Musicians  Great  Jazz  Artists  And  Every  Time  We  Perform  They're 
[02:47:00]  So  Creative  That  They  Change  It  Every  Night  It's  Never  The  Same  Show  It  Might  Be  The  Same  Repertoire  But  Believe  Me  Every  Night  It  Feels  That  Improvise  Every  Show  No  Matter  Where  We're  At  And  What  Do  You  Do  To  Care  For  Your  Voice  Because  You've  Been  Blessed  Over  The  Years  That  You  Still  Have  Your  Set  Of  Pipes  And  Other  Artists  Over  The  Years  Have  Lost  The  Ability  To  Hit  Some  Of  The  Notes  And  What  Do  You  Attribute 
[02:47:30]  That  To  Well  Good  Training  After  The  Second  World  War  I  Came  Out  And  Joined  The  American  Theater  Wing  And  Because  It  Was  The  Good  War  As  Stud  Terkel  In  Chicago  Called  It  We  Were  Just  Given  The  Best  Teachers  In  New  York  City  And  The  American  Theater  Wing  Was  So  Good  It  Became  The  Actors  Studio  And  All  Those  Great  Teachers  Really  Taught  Us  Well  About  How  To  Preserve  Your  Voice  And  The  Repetition  Of 
[02:48:00]  Taking  Care  Of  It  And  It  Works  Because  It's  Obviously  Worked  Because  You're  One  Of  The  Few  Artists  That  Just  Sound  Amazing  So  Many  Years  Later  You  Can't  Even  Tell  How  Do  You  Stay  Young  Tony  Well  I  Don't  Know  About  Staying  Young  I  Just  Accept  My  Age  I  Don't  Regret  It  You  You  Still  Performing  I  Always  Say  Life  Is  A  Gift  You  Know  And  Just  Enjoy  Every  Moment  We're  All  Going  Through  It  You  Work  Out  And  No  No  One's  Going  To  Beat 
[02:48:30]  It  No  Matter  How  You  Feel  Now  Once  You  Get  Old  It's  Not  Like  The  End  Of  The  World  You  You're  Still  Alive  But  There's  Things  You're  Doing  You're  Working  Out  And  Eating  Right  And  All  That  I  Played  Tennis  Yeah  Three  Times  A  Week  I  Exercise  And  Wow  Eat  Good  Foods  And  I  Have  A  Wonderful  Wife  Who  Takes  Care  Of  Me  Everything's  Great  I  Hate  Going  To  The  Gym  Like  I  Know  This  Looks  Like  It  Was  Built  In  A  Gym  I  Could  See  That  Even

[02:56:00]  Is  A  Shock  But  Back  Show  Business  People  Didn't  Talk  About  That  Type  Of  Stuff  Public  Yeah  So  To  Me  It's  Interesting  Like  Did  You  Guys  All  Knew  And  It  Was  Just  Never  Spoken  About  I'm  Sure  Privately  They  Were  All  Making  Candelabra  Jokes  Yeah  But  Sure  You  Just  Wouldn't  Go  For  Just  Being  Awful  The  Reason  All  The  Candles  Are  Melted  Sitting  There  At  The  Brown  Derby  Laughing  Along  With  Uncle  Miltie  About  Liberace  Yeah  Brock  Hudson 
[02:56:30]  Just  Quietly  Goes  To  The  Bathroom  While  They're  Joking  Come  On  Guys  Don't  Be  So  Judgmental  Of  Course  They  Knew  For  Some  Reason  The  Public  Didn't  Know  They  Weren't  Educated  Enough  Yet  I 
[02:57:00]  Knew  He  Knew  He  Wasn't  Going  For  That  Oh  My  God  But  I  Thought  Of  It  I'm  Like  You  Just  Can't  We  Can't  We  Can't  We  That  Was  A  Good  Decision  Good  Decision  Great  Joke  That  Would  Have  Been  One  For  The  Fun  But  He  Would  Have  Been  Like  What  He  Would  Look  At  Me  When  He  Said  Nat  King  Cole  Nat  King  Cole  Nat  King  Cole  Over  Here  I  I  Saw  Jimmy  Turn  Away  And  He  Would  Not  Look  At  Me  He 
[02:57:30]  Makes  Eye  Contact  When  He  Talks  To  You  Tony  Bennett  Makes  Eye  Contact  Which  Is  Good  He's  Very  Aware  You  Know  His  Hearing  Is  Probably  Decent  Let's  Get  Time  For  My  Account  To  Text  Me  While  I'm  On  The  Radio  He  Doesn't  Know  When  You  Work  Gotta  Be  A  Thrill  What  Was  The  Nat  King  Cole  Thing  He  Was  Talking  About  Other  Artists  He  Worked  With  Over  The  Years  And  He  Said  Nat  King  Cole  And  There's  A line  From  Goodfellas  Where  Pesci  Is  With  His  Chick  In  The  Restaurant  And  She's  Talking  About  How  Sammy  Davis  Junior  She  Could  See  How  A  Guy 
[02:58:00]  Could  Go  For  A  Guy  Like  That  And  He  Goes  The  Next  Thing  You  I'll  Be  Sin  With  Nat  King  Cole  Something  Like  That  So  So  I  Said  That  And  I  Know  Jimmy  Caught  It  Because  I  Saw  The  Corners  Of  His  Mouth  Go  But  He's  Trying  To  Just  Look  At  Tony  Without  Laughing  In  His  Face  At  That  Point  They  Had  To  Hate  Though  Deep  Down  I  Would  Love  To  Again  I  Don't  Know  If  He  Admit  It  But  There  Had  To  Be  Some  Resentment  When  Groups  Like  The  Beatles  Came  Along  There  Had  To 
[02:58:30]  Went  And  That  That  And  He  Talked  About  How  He  Hated  The  Beatles  Like  Oh  Yeah 
[02:59:00]  They  Just  They  Wrecked  Music  Music  Was  Great  And  Like  He  Thinks  To  This  Day  People  Would  Still  Be  Going  it was part of  musical history but I don't think people  were still going to be doing that now  if it wasn't for the Beatles. I think the Beatles are proving themselves  by the way at this point in time.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the guy, we always talk about royalty  and music and like McCartney, we saw  McCartney, he's a guy that kind of  trumps anybody in the room  when he's like, two of the Rolling Stones were at the  show and I've said this on the air 
[02:59:30]  but all these celebrities were there and McCartney  didn't introduce any of them. He just goes, all non-celebrities  clap for all celebrities. He doesn't give a  fuck about any of these. They're all beneath him.  He's the biggest in the room, yeah.  But, Tony Bennett's a guy  that could be not impressed when McCartney  came in. And McCartney would probably be  like, look at him with  reverence. He's fawning.  Because even though he's not a rock and roll guy  like Chuck Berry but still, he'd be  fawning over Tony Bennett. Can you believe he's  85? Fuck. He looks fucking  amazing. I wanted 
[03:00:00]  I wanted to say 85 years young  and then just make that face  like we all know. How do you do it?  Yeah, yeah. I want it for like 100.  Yeah. And how many  kids you got? How many?  Oh, yeah.  That scene in fucking casino.  My favorite scene in fucking casino  during Aces High  when he goes, how many kids? And who was that?  Bobby Vinton or whatever? Paul Anka?  No. I think it was Bobby Vinton.  Bobby Vinton, I think.  He goes, how many kids? He goes, we have  eight children. And De Niro puts down  his cigarette and then gives that horrible 
[03:00:30]  who gives a shit applause.  Horrible who cares.  But he had to put his cigarette in the  ashtray next to his mic and he's like  looks around like, yeah, right.  Fucking brilliant movie.  The subtleties in  all of Scorsese's movies.  Those movies.  Amazing.  His movies and Coppola's movies  like when you're flicking through  when I'm flicking through the TV, you know,  looking at you and you come on to  one of these things.  It's like, oh, well, let me just watch  this for five minutes.  It's two hours.  Two hours.  And it's like, there's only like  five of those movies. 
[03:01:00]  Yes.  The Godfather's, Apocalypse Now,  Casino, Goodfellas.  It's just like, you can't,  it's unbelievable.  There are a few movies.  It's unexplainably.  Why?  Why?  It's unbelievable.  Why am I compelled to not turn this off now?  I know every line of dialogue,  every scene that's coming up.  I know in Goodfellas,  I like when the guy beats the shit out of the kid  across the street with it.  Oh, yeah.  I love that scene so much  that I know that it's 45 minutes into the movie. 
[03:01:30]  So when I'm flicking through the TV,  I'll see when the movie started  and I'll go maybe watch what I'm really watching,  you know, and then I'll come back just to,  Karen, go in the house.  Yeah, yeah.  Put your hands on her again,  you're fucking dead!  And just the way it sounds  when he's cracking him  with the fucking butt of that gun.  Yeah.  The way the guy says,  yeah, you ain't having a problem.  He doesn't even get to the end.  You got a problem?  You want something?  Fucko?  Yeah, fucko.  And then he just breaks the bridge of his nose open  and keeps hitting him. 
[03:02:00]  And the guy's getting lower and lower and lower  as he's beating him.  It's a fantastic scene.  I think we talked to that guy once.  No, no, we talked to the guy  that actually said,  we were doing a call-in thing.  We were like,  the most famous person  that's listening to us right now,  please call us.  It was when we first got to New York.  And we wanted to know who the most famous person was.  And this guy called in and he goes,  I'm in the scene  where the guy gets the shit beat out of him.  Oh, okay.  By that, he goes,  I'm the guy in the background  that goes,  don't shoot.  Oh, interesting.  And I was like,  holy fuck,  you were in Goodfellas, dude. 
[03:02:30]  We talked to that guy.  That's fucking cool as shit.  I got a speaking part.  I knew it was something  to do with that scene.  Don't shoot.  Yeah.  His dumb friends.  I love that.  Oh, it's fantastic.  They're a part of the fabric  in a weird way.  I hate to say it like that  because I sound like a fucking Aunt Nancy,  but I mean,  they are a part of,  like Cuckoo's Nest  I Can Never Turn Off  or any of those movies.  Platoon's another one  that I love to watch  a lot of.  Yeah.  Can't turn that off either.  Which one?  Platoon.  Don't touch my girl.  Turn it off. 
[03:03:00]  Why would you confront him  with that face?  Oh my God.  He's got it.  Oh my God.  Turn it to him.  Hey, how many times?  Swear my fucking mother.  If you touch her again,  you're dead.  He kills him.  Don't shoot.  We talked to that guy.  We talked to him.  Oh, did he beat the piss  out of him, man.  Yeah, his fucking matching  brown jacket and slacks. 
[03:03:30]  And the way Leota walks back  still all pissed.  He's got like his fucking piss.  His Jimmy Norton  just saw something  on the street face  that he didn't like.  Yeah, but he did something  that Jimmy Norton  would have done.  He acted like a man.  Jimmy Norton would have  pretended he didn't know  and just fucking...  You all right?  Huh?  I wish he would have  done that to her  after she fucking  wrecked half the scenes  of The Sopranos.  I know there are women  like my best friends  who would have gotten  out of there  the minute their boyfriend  gave them a gun to hide.  Go to another Dr. Melfi scene,  you're fucking dead!  I gotta admit the truth. 
[03:04:00]  It turned me on.  It turned me on.  Yeah, Stephen's actually got out.  We gotta get Stephen out of here.  Let's play the game.  Thank you so much.  I'm glad you hung, man.  That was a lot of fun.  Sorry we had to do  with this shit.  Stephen will be  at the Calvin Theater  in Northampton.  That is...  Is that this Friday?  Yes.  This Friday night,  a great, great comic.  And just go to Stephen Wright.  It's W-R-I-G-H-T,  Stephen Wright,  S-T-E-V-E-N-W-I-T dot com.  And all of his dates  will be there.  Atlantic City,  Borgata, November 4th, too. 
[03:04:30]  That's great.  Oh, that's very cool.  Thank you so much.  Great seeing you guys.  Stephen,  anytime, man.  Happy to see you, buddy.  Thanks.  Always love having you.  Go Sox, by the way.  Hey.  You turn around in shock.  No, I'm serious.  I'm not a Yankees fan.  See you, buddy.  Anything Mets,  you know,  but whatever.  I love Stephen Wright.  Yeah, he's cool.  He's fun to hang, man.  I actually,  I hope the Sox  at least snag the wild card spot.  Why?  I don't know.  I kind of like that  whole Sox-Yankees bullshit,  to tell you the truth.  I know it's redundant. 
[03:05:00]  It's every year  for the most part,  but it is kind of  one of those big,  I like watching  a playoff game  with the Yankees  and the Sox.  Hey, someone's reminding me  that Don Rickles,  also 85 and also from Queens.  Really?  Don Rickles looks more 85  than Tony Bennett does.  Tony Bennett fucking  doesn't have an ounce  of fat on him.  You know what's fucked up?  Tony Bennett,  you ever see a person  that's too old  to wear suits anymore?  They just look like  the bags on bones.  And there's a little dandruff  on the shoulders  and they're a little wrinkly. 
[03:05:30]  The suit doesn't fit right  because they don't have  shoulders anymore.  They got like a skeleton  that they're trying  to put a sleeve on.  He fucking came in  with a tailored  fucking designer suit.  No dandruff  on the shoulders.  And looked,  if I may use  the term from the day,  he looked fabulous.  Full head of hair.  Full head of fucking  white hair.  You know what happened  with Tony Bennett though?  Like years ago,  he looked like that.  Like years ago,  he had the white  kind of hair and everything.  So it worked well  for him to kind of  look older years ago 
[03:06:00]  because now you look  at him and go,  bah, that motherfucker  hasn't changed.  He got to an age  and then just looks  that way for the rest  of his life.  That's it.  Go for him.  Yeah, Rickles.  Go for him.  Rickles still fucking  doing it, huh?  Yeah, Rickles.  We got to get Rickles in here.  I said that already.  What are you, dumb?  When you said that to Leno,  I fucking howled.  What are you, dumb?  What are you, dumb?  He's fucking the greatest, man.  We got to get him in here  somehow.  He only does Letterman.  I don't even think  he does Howarth.  He only does Letterman  when he's in town.  Yeah, he's one of those guys.  He's just got his...  Fucking Pesci beat him  over the face with the phone. 
[03:06:30]  I don't know.  He was very nice.  It was one of my fucking...  It's one of those highlights  that go in your mental reel.  Oh, yeah.  It was after he saw  the bit that I did  and he was the lead guest.  It was not this time  but it was time before  and I walked off  and he goes,  that was good, Jim.  He was just...  Nice.  That's fucking Rickles.  Yeah, that was a great one.  That's cool.  That was a great one.  All right.  Tomorrow on the show...  What do we have on the program?  We got audio from Bobo's Date.  Do we get a tease?  Can we get a tease?  A little tease, actually.  I was actually all weekend 
[03:07:00]  I've been wondering about this.  We might be able  to squeeze this in, actually.  And I kind of want to hear...  We go through this shit.  Because I know Sam was on the date.  You were the chaperone.  Yeah, I mean,  if you just want to do a tease,  I'll tell you a track to play.  Hold on, let me see.  I was going to say to him,  hey, how do you breathe  with your heart  when you left it over there  in San Francisco?  We could do this.  San Francisco.  We could do this now.  Is that mine?  Yeah.  Yeah, we could do  the whole thing now.  All right, let's do it.  It's six minutes of clips.  Let's start it then.  What happened was  the Bobo dating game  turned out to be all right, I guess. 
[03:07:30]  It was great.  By the way,  I don't acknowledge Bobo on Twitter  and I can't even tweet that.  I don't acknowledge him on Twitter  because then I'm acknowledging him  on Twitter,  but just so you know  where I stand,  I don't acknowledge Bobo  on Twitter.  Even fucking E-Rock  blocked him finally.  Yeah, but that's because...  And I know a lot of people,  like, they love fucking with Bobo  and all that on Twitter,  but just leave my name out of it.  I don't want to read  all those tweets anymore.  Bobo was bothering all of us  all weekend  because E-Rock  kept fucking with him.  Oh, is that what was happening?  Yeah, E-Rock is obsessed  with fucking with him. 
[03:08:00]  I got upset  because he wasn't very appreciative  after how the date went.  He wasn't.  I think he was insulting the show.  Yeah, but that's because  E-Rock told him  he wasn't going to be allowed  back on the show  and E-Rock was going to delete  all the audio clips  to Bobo.  That was after.  Why didn't he like the date?  He didn't get laid.  Why would he?  Exactly.  He thought he was going to get  some kind of action, right?  Yeah, well, he thought  he would at least get  a little something  and then...  And he thought more, though,  with victim number one  that he was going to get  some action. 
[03:08:30]  But of course,  since that's the girl  he wanted,  we had picked victim number two  who despised Bobo.  And in the end  they were the same girl  but he's too stupid  to understand that.  Neither girl was going to  kiss him,  hold his hand,  fucking yank his paw,  nothing was going to ever  happen with either girl.  I think victim number one  would have been a little  more sympathetic  to his retardation  than victim number two was.  Victim number two,  once she got out of the studio,  was very nice to Bobo.  She was a fabulous  conversationalist.  Oh, that's nice.  Was she hot? 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, she was a lot.  And now victim number one  was allowed to tag along,  I heard?  Yeah, we put her at a...  Because some of the other  guys wanted to go.  Oh, that's...  So I said, you know...  They liked victim number one.  The vultures wanted it.  They all thought  they had a shot.  Some of the vultures  were circling.  What does she look like?  Let me see victim number one.  Wait, Sam,  who thought they had a shot  that they went on the date?  Paul.  He was working on her.  Paul was working on her?  Good for Paul, though.  She was definitely cute.  But Danny and Travis  also came along.  I think they wanted to just  see the date happen.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe undermine 
[03:09:30]  anything that was going on.  I had them sit at a different table  as to keep the romance.  Keep the romantic thing going,  I understand.  And we got photos  on our Facebook page,  Opie and Anthony.  Is it Opie and Anthony  on Facebook?  Yes.  And boy, how comfortable  Bobo looked  in those pictures  of him with the girl.  Yeah, yeah.  And how many times  is one guy gonna fall  for the same fucking bit?  You've been banned  from the show bit.  Thousands.  Holy shit.  I had to hold him. 
[03:10:00]  What?  I told him on Friday  when he came back  in tears  because once again  somebody told him  he was banned.  I don't know who told him.  I said Bobo.  Why did you need  to come back on the show?  Shut up.  Bobo, I usually don't  take these calls  and you're on hold  all morning,  but I gotta ask you.  Bobo.  Yeah.  Why do you, Bobo,  fall for the same  fucking bit  so many times?  There have been times  I've never been sure  if things are pranks  or not,  but I guess realize 
[03:10:30]  that this was a prank.  Bobo, I told you  why do you fall  for the exact same bit  numerous times?  I don't even know  the number at this point.  I would guess 20 times.  20 times we've told you  you've been banned  from the show  and every fucking time  you end up in tears.  I don't know.  I guess that scared  part of me  too much overwhelm me.  I guess that...  I was sending him  private messages  so nobody could see.  It was private  on Twitter  that said,  Bobo, just stop this. 
[03:11:00]  E-Rock was fucking  with you.  Yeah.  You're not banned.  You never are banned.  You always come back  when we need you.  I hate the show.  I hate you guys.  By the way,  victim number one,  her consolation prize.  invitation to the next  compound party.  She was very excited  about that.  She asked me  if you were being serious.  I was being serious,  absolutely.  So she was going to get  an invite to the next  compound party.  I was told, though,  she was pissed  that she lost this contest.  She won the money.  Who won?  The blonde did.  Does the brunette  look like a goer? 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way,  the next compound party  will be  the big Halloween bash.  Oh, those are the best.  If you remember last year,  there, yes,  we are having  a compound Halloween party.  Sure.  Look in your email  for your e-vites.  They'll be going out soon.  I won't look.  I don't want to be  disappointed anymore.  Oh, Opie,  you're always on  every invitation list.  I won't be looking anymore.  You are on  every invitation list.  I don't want to be  disappointed again.  No, I swear. 
[03:12:00]  See, I told you  they fucking ate each other.  Shut up!  Of course,  we'll need,  I won't accept  her email,  but I will  so you can forward off  an e-vite to a girl  because it's always good  to have a lovely girl  wandering around  to talk  and maybe entertain  some of the guys.  I learned that  from one of those  old 50s  how to throw a party  things  where you need some girls.  Dude, can we please  do that at your  Halloween party?  Oh, absolutely. 
[03:12:30]  I say we,  I might have an invite.  I don't know.  You, of course,  are invited,  ye me.  Wait, October 30s?  No, it's going to be  the Saturday  before Halloween  because Halloween  is on a Monday,  I think.  Oh.  And you can't do  a Sunday  because I don't like  doing the fucking  next day work thing  because you're having  a party  and by 8.30  at night  everyone's like,  hey, I gotta go.  It's a bunch of  bull turkey.  Exactly.  So, well,  it's going to be  the Saturday  before Halloween  so mark that down  on your calendars. 
[03:13:00]  Big compound  Halloween party.  Cancel special delivery.  Please.  I mean, literally,  just cancel it.  More importantly,  can we get through  the date audio  so we can move on  to this bit?  I forgot we're  in a rush.  So, Bobo went  on this date  with a girl  that doesn't care  about him.  Yes.  No, I mean,  I don't think  anybody had  entered the contest.  Bobo, you do realize  neither girl cared  about you, right?  Yeah, I realized  the right event.  I just realized  that it's just a goof.  I think eventually  we should try 
[03:13:30]  to find someone  that would actually  go out on a real date  with you.  But see,  we gotta take the money  out of it  because these girls  were just looking  for the money.  But once we take  the money out,  then the girls  go out, too.  There's no girls left.  I'm thinking.  But you never know,  though.  There might be  another fucked up  Bobo type person  out there.  Yeah, you know  they just wanted  the money, right, Bobo?  Yeah, I knew.  They just wanted  the money.  Dude, I see waterheads  that are with each other.  That's true.  There's someone  for everyone.  I'm thinking  we could get a real  female Bobo type  for Bobo.  The other sister  I think was a true story. 
[03:14:00]  Two fucking  complete morons.  But before you know it,  they're fucking  to marching band music.  That fucking dolt.  Giovanni Ribisi tard.  Yeah, the bit is,  we don't even want  to call it a bit,  but this is officially on.  We're looking for  a female Bobo type  that really does  want to go out  with Bobo.  We gotta find a moron  that wants to date Bobo.  No money, no shit.  Nothing.  If you're a girl  and you're fucking dumb, 
[03:14:30]  dumb as fuck,  please give us a call.  And your genitals  are as beat up as Bobos.  Right.  Yeah.  Maybe you had a clitoral  fucking circumcision  with a spade shovel.  Yeah.  If your pussy looks like  he did time in the Sudan.  Yes.  One swath  with a post hole digger  and you're in.  That person  wouldn't even be listening  right now.  No, of course.  But we might find one.  Yes.  We're gonna try to find you  a real date, Bobo.  Well, I took some advice  from a friend of mine  and had me...  Well, you're still talking  on the phone, 
[03:15:00]  so obviously it wasn't  good advice.  Get it.  Shoot yourself.  I am on the...  I was close to the subway,  but then I had to get  off the next stop,  so...  Yeah.  It's a shit.  That's great.  Endless.  You know what I hear  is a great thing to visit?  The third rail  when you're on the subway.  You know what would be good  if you had an ability  to differentiate  between information,  which is mildly interesting,  and information  that has no redeeming  human value whatsoever. 
[03:15:30]  Ah, God.  I would like you once  to understand  that there is a difference  in the interest we have  in hearing information.  Yeah.  And I didn't get blown  on the date.  It's interesting.  Like, I was going to get  off the subway,  but didn't.  It's horrible,  and nobody cares.  Not an iota of interest.  None.  I don't know who you would  tell that info to,  usually.  I'd be embarrassed  if I thought that.  A regular person,  I don't even know  who you would make suffer 
[03:16:00]  with that info.  It's terrible.  It would be in your head,  but you choose not  to share with anybody.  Yeah, yeah.  Why?  Now we're babbling too much,  we might not be able  to play the audio soon.  Oh, no.  Well, this is a great tease,  then.  I knew it was going  to be a tease.  Bobo, did you enjoy the date?  Give me a tease clip.  Yeah, let's have a tease clip.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Let's see.  What were you going to say, Bobo?  Yeah, sorry.  You're right.  What were you going to say?  Jimmy's right.  I was going to say  I enjoyed the date,  and maybe I could take  from what I learned  from this date,  and maybe, hopefully, 
[03:16:30]  I could maybe pick up  girls' face  from what I learned  from this date.  How not to...  Wow.  Wait a minute.  Okay, that was actually  worth listening to.  Hold on.  What did you learn  from the date, Bobo?  Good question.  Well, I learned for sure  not to keep the person interested.  Maybe try to make the person laugh.  Maybe try not to bump it  into the person  when I'm trying to get  to whatever chair  I'm sitting at at the table. 
[03:17:00]  Wait, what happened, Sam?  Sam was on the air.  What happened?  Bobo heard us laughing  while they were walking  because Troy also came  and he was videoing  some stuff,  but we were laughing,  and Bobo picked up  on the fact that  when he walked,  he was consistently  walking in front of her.  They'd get to an escalator  where it was just  room for one person,  and instead of being  chivalrous,  he actually stepped  in front of her  to make sure  he went first.  We get to Dave and Buster's,  and he sat down 
[03:17:30]  at the table  before she even got  to the table,  let alone pulled out  her chair.  Oh, he should have  been romantic.  He heard me just  guffaw laughing  when he sat down  at the table,  and he realized  what I was laughing at,  so he jumped up  out of his seat  and actually pushed  her out of the way  and then pulled  her chair out,  but she was pushed.  She was pushed  so he could do  the right thing.  That's hilarious.  But Bobo,  the good news is  that the girl  that you wanted to win,  Courtney,  just got invited  to the compound party,  so I guess  when you're there,  maybe you could  hit on her.  True. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, there's been  a, I saw some  Twitter chatter,  some chatter on  Twitter about  this adult  actually attending  my Halloween party.  Yeah.  No.  What?  This doesn't happen.  I'm sorry, Bobo.  You won't be getting  an invite.  Oh.  I'm fine with that.  But Pat from  Wunaki goes  and Big A goes,  and the girl  who wanted to date  with Bobo  was going to be there.  The girl wants  to date Bobo,  and she's going  to be an answer.  Do you have  another picture of her? 
[03:18:30]  Pat from Wunaki  is great.  Fucking Big A,  great, fun people.  What do I need?  Fucking this guy  just lurching around  my house like a ghoul.  Hello.  Anthony,  where's the soda pop?  But people would  like to see Bobo  at the compound.  Not me,  and I own the place.  So fuck.  Owner reserves the right.  She's on right?  Let me see her.  She's cute.  She's very cute.  What is it?  Bobo.  Look at that lab.  That mouth open.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[03:19:00]  Steven S.  from Bayshore  just made me dry heave.  And it takes a lot.  It really does.  I got a strong will.  He writes,  where can you find  a girl who will  be willing to  I just updated.  Fuck.  Okay.  Who will be willing  to suck the cream  out of Bobo's  nose boils?  Oh, Jesus.  Bobo, you have  nose boils?  Do you have  nose boils, Bobo?  No.  Yeah, right.  All right, what clip  are we playing as a tease?  And then we'll have  the rest of the audio  from the big Bobo date  tomorrow. 
[03:19:30]  I think the perfect tease  clip would be  his Chip impression.  He started randomly  doing Chip at the table.  I think we were referring  to the waiters  wearing the same clothes.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden  Daniel Chip Curlin  came out.  Well, that's his attempt  at making people  laugh.  Right.  Making his date  laugh.  Now, keep in mind  we found out earlier  and was told to Bobo  that his date  didn't listen to the show. 
[03:20:00]  Right.  So she doesn't know  what the fuck.  So it's a Chip impression  with the context  of who Chip is  being completely removed.  So why was she here  if she doesn't listen  to the show?  Her uncle listens.  Her uncle pimped her out.  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Her uncle's a big fan  and he was very proud  to have her on there.  and win the contest.  She's kind of cute, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I wouldn't mind  giving her the old...  They both had  very different looks.  That's a kiss  and a hysterectomy,  by the way.  Sorry.  But they were both cute. 
[03:20:30]  They both had  very different looks.  Both good looking.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, here's Bobo  doing his Chip impression.  I hate myself.  Jim, you look good.  I saw my picture  with Tony Bennett.  I literally should be  killed by Al-Qaeda.  Fat pig.  Every day we can  guarantee you  that Jimmy's going  to look down  and he squeezes it  and he yells at it.  You should have seen me  eating fucking  chocolate-covered almonds  after Leno.  Congratulating himself,  piggy boy.  Good job, fat pig.  They are delicious. 
[03:21:00]  They're fucking raw.  Dark chocolate?  Refreshing?  Dark chocolate-covered almonds?  No, regular chocolate almonds.  I ate those Luna bars.  Which ones did you get?  The one with the chocolate  for a lunatic?  The chocolate powder  or the chocolate?  They're just chocolate  around the fucking  delicious almond.  I just kept eating them.  Yeah, but you spend  enough time on the elliptical  that you could do that  sometimes.  I fucking,  I just looked at my  Tony Bennett picture.  Fat blubber neck.  Really?  Yeah, blubber neck  fucking McGillicuddy.  I noticed you had  a big smile.  Yeah, I know.  I should have had 
[03:21:30]  a big fucking fist  crashing into my mouth  last night  when I was eating  pretzels  and fucking smokehouse  almonds last night  at one in the morning.  Wonder why I can't sleep  on a salt rush.  But pretzels aren't,  pretzels,  pretzels aren't that bad.  Carbs are terrible.  They're not that bad.  Fat pig before bed.  Have some more  comfort food, tits.  Your nickname's  just tits now?  Oh, fucking shit.  Yeah, shit.  Fuck, Jimmy,  you rule.  Goddamn, man.  I want to know  about Uncle Paul tomorrow.  Sure, what do you  want to know? 
[03:22:00]  Well, I hope you found  out Uncle Paul  likes to drink sometimes  and gets revealing.  Oh, yeah.  I want to save it  for tomorrow.  I want to save it  for tomorrow.  I'm hearing things  about Uncle Paul.  He's a big drinker  and he's not as vague  when he's drunk.  He drinks a lot  but he's a lightweight.  Yeah.  Yeah, he can't handle  his shit.  He used to babysit you.  I'd poke my  you-know-what  through the crib  and you'd grab it.  He was a little  blue-eyed Gregorio. 
[03:22:30]  Can you molest  someone else today?  Why does it  always have to be me?  You was the cutest one.  Can we take turns  being molested  by Uncle Paul?  Always.  Why is it always me?  Why is it always me?  Uncle Paul likes you.  It has to be me  every time.  It really does.  What about Travis  or Sam or Anthony?  Young Anthony.  I told you  him and his brother  would play the game.  The peeny flip.  I'd say,  go ahead,  flip your peeny.  That's right.  I remember hearing 
[03:23:00]  about the peeny flip.  And his mother  would take pictures.  Take pictures  when he was in the tub.  That's horrible.  Yeah,  and then the court  said she had to leave  so she went  with a Jewish fella.  Is that what happened?  Oh, God.  Here's the other thing.  Bobo doesn't laugh  at anything.  So why is he even  a fan of the show?  He's basically...  Do you ever laugh?  Yeah,  I do,  all right?  I was just trying  to be not  to interrupt you guys  while you were talking.  I don't understand  why you and Stark  and Patty 
[03:23:30]  listen to this radio show.  Yeah,  because neither one  will ever laugh  and when they're here  they just stare at you.  When amazing shit's  going on on the show  and they just stare.  It's like,  how do they ever  become fans?  I have no idea.  How do you never  meet when I'm at home?  I'm laughing at home.  Give us a laugh.  How does Bobo laugh?  Because I don't know.  God.  Sounds like a  Primatine Mist commercial.  Yeah,  exactly.  Quick,  blow out the candle. 
[03:24:00]  Now we can't play  the teaser clip now.  Why not?  Now he's just laughing.  We won't stop laughing now.  Stop laughing.  That's funny,  you fucking hyena idiot.  Play a little tease.  All right,  here's Bobo  doing his chip impression  to impress his date  that doesn't know  anything about the show.  Yes.  Everybody's like  wearing the same thing.  It's like,  we're all just going to  wear the same thing  as some...  Can't...  Can't...  Can't...  It makes it hard  to find a missing person  like you say  to describe the person. 
[03:24:30]  It's like,  Zaid,  no,  they all like wear this...  It's like wearing  like a shiny suit  and the officers  like Zaid,  no,  no,  they like all...  Everybody,  we're all wearing  those shiny suits  and stuff.  What?  What?  What are you talking about?  Oh, no,  that was a chip.  What?  Chip?  Never mind,  it's a character  Jim Norton does.  It's...  Oh,  what a bomb.  And it always works  when you have to  explain it after.  Oh,  what a bomb-a-rooney.  I do laugh, 
[03:25:00]  all right?  Just confusion  on her face.  Oh,  and he just kept going  and going with it.  He wouldn't shut up  and stop.  Stupid delivery.  Bobo,  why would you...  That was very stupid.  Why would you do  a show reference  for someone  that has never  heard the show?  This is basic shit.  Yeah.  No,  well,  I thought it was fun.  It didn't quite work out  so well.  Something you don't know  about Bobo is  he likes to talk  about the show  when he's out on dates.  Is it just constant  like talking about the show?  Jimmy just looked  at his gut again.  I did.  I lifted him.  I'm fucking 
[03:25:30]  so filled  with physical self.  I was on the Stairmaster  yesterday  and the elliptical.  Oh,  good for you.  You had a lot  of treating to do  because you've been  very successful lately.  All I've been doing  is eating treats.  You had to treat yourself.  You were on Leno twice,  G4.  You're a good boy.  You treat yourself  when you're a good boy.  There's a lot of treats  that you have to do now.  You get very indulgent.  I'm so fucking...  How many treats  did you give yourself?  Um,  I ate a lot of sushi 
[03:26:00]  because my two favorite  sushi places  is Mazao twice.  There's another place  you like out there now?  Yes.  Not as good as Mazao.  It's where I see a lot of...  It's where I saw DiCaprio once.  Didn't get...  I never got a picture there.  I saw Venus fucking...  What was it?  No, Serena Williams  was there when we were there.  Was it down the hill?  No.  To the left?  Uh-uh.  Huh.  No.  Is it close...  It's not close to Hollywood Hills?  Sunset Boulevard?  No.  Not far,  but it's not there.  Down Hollywood Way.  Wait, what...  What else did I have?  I had a bunch of treats. 
[03:26:30]  I didn't have any desserts.  Are you window updating?  Always.  It's fucking...  It's good.  I want to shut  the fucking thing off.  All right, listen.  We're out of time.  Don't power off!  Don't unplug your machine  installing one of two updates.  People want to know  why you're eating pretzels  at 1 a.m.,  but you keep late hours.  1 a.m. is not that late  for Jim Norton.  Yeah, I was...  Jim Norton.  I was writing down  some material  and I was having  some pretzel treats. 
[03:27:00]  And I decided  to have some  smokehouse almonds.  And I had some water.  So, you just choose  not to sleep  because the water  is going to keep you up.  The water ought to pee.  You pee a lot. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Bobo.  Yeah.  Bobo, thank you, sir.  Yeah, Bobo.  All right, and Anthony,  I got a message for you.  I'll try to earn my  weight to the compound someday.  No, no, there's no  earning away.  There's no message for me.  There's no earning away.  Don't fucking include me  in any tweets.  I don't want to see  my fucking name.  He's mad.  He's hurt.  Just don't, okay?  He's hurt that you  don't include him, Bobo.  That's the bottom line.  You sent tweets to Opie  and to E-Rock,  never to Anthony. 
[03:28:00]  E-Rock is really angry.  Why are you angry  at a guy that has  half a brain?  I don't understand  the people that are mad  at the guy that has  half a brain.  I don't get it.  E-Rock's yelling  in a mirror.  Why are you so angry  at Bobo?  Because he just assumes  that if you mention  anything,  he has to be a part of it  and why aren't you  giving that to him?  He only has an 80% brain.  This isn't bullshit  retard cover over this stuff.  This is just him  being an asshole.  He just assumes  he gets everything  that this show has. 
[03:28:30]  Eric's upset  because sometimes  Bobo says,  don't you know who I am?  That too.  Oh, really?  To people in the hallway  downstairs.  Didn't he,  Saturday or something,  people coming up to him?  I think somebody said,  I was reading,  somebody said  at a bar or something  that Bobo was hanging out at,  a bunch of people  were coming up to him  like he was a celebrity.  So he's famous.  So he's got an ego.  Bobo, are you famous?  Maybe moderately, actually.  Moderately.  He used to go to comedy shows  and hand out headshots  that he printed out himself. 
[03:29:00]  Eric's jealous  that he doesn't get recognized  like Bobo gets recognized.  Bobo is a celebrity  because of all the things  he's done  and that E-Rock  is just not that recognized.  Do you think the two  Dunderheads are competing?  I love Dunderheads.  It really isn't.  One of my favorite ones  to Jim.  I love Dunderheads.  I want to create a character.  That guy, Chris,  who got mad  and yelled  dumb, dumb, lunkhead  also had a character  he would do  called Machine Gun Chickie.  What did Machine Gun Chickie do?  I don't know,  but it was terrible. 
[03:29:30]  Hard name.  I was young.  I thought it was funny.  I would always say  Machine Gun Chick-ass  because I was  I hated Machine Gun Chickie.  You were retarded.  Yeah, I, I, I,  why, I, right.  So Bobo annoys you?  Just now.  He's like,  I'll do,  I'll earn my way  to an invite  to the compound  when Anthony flat out said  you're not coming  to this thing.  I don't need him.  I know it would just be  so fucking uncomfortable. 
[03:30:00]  He does it on his way  because he's retarded.  He's bad at the compound.  That's not an excuse.  What do you mean?  Yeah, he was once.  Retardation, unfortunately,  is an excuse.  That's because Keith the cop  thought it would be funny  to call him,  tell him to get on the train,  go to the train station  near my house,  and then Keith  picked him up,  blindfolded him,  put a bag on his head,  and put a bag on his head  and drove him to my house  so he wouldn't know  where I lived  and then like let him loose.  It was funny.  Oh, it was funny as fuck.  He's harmless.  When I had to drain my pool  because he was naked in it.  What about when he was  running around your backyard nude? 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  Was he really?  Yes.  It was the greatest night  of my life.  I'm so upset I was nude.  That's kind of funny.  Sometimes when we touch.  Bobo, you remember  when you were naked  at Anthony's house?  You stopped grumbling.  I'll help you, Toadie.  So you were naked, Bobo?  Yeah, yeah.  It was funny  a long time ago  because I...  Hey, Bobo,  what are you doing  with that story? 
[03:31:00]  I aims to bore you with it.  He's terrible.  Yeah, boy,  I'd not hear boring stories  like this.  What's wrong with it?  Ain't got no point to it.  He ain't queer funny  or ha-ha funny.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.  All right.  Let's go, Ho!  Yeah, we're done.  Exactly.  Bobo, go fuck yourself.  Yeah, later, Bobo.  Or have your Bobo do it.  All right, I'll speak to you 
[03:31:30]  guys later.  Maybe.  Twitter, Anthony, please.  I'm listening.  Yeah, you've got to send  him a tweet  if you want to go  to the party.  Yeah, beg...  I'm not going to bother you  with Twitter.  Oh, shut up.  Just do it.  No, it's fine.  Oh, UN General Assembly.  Yep.  President's in town  Uh-huh  Yeah  Roland's just trying to say Ahmadinejad outside  I wish we had fucking had a recorder going for that one  Ahmadinejad  That's mine  Oh, is that Anthony's?  They gave it to me? 
[03:32:00]  Roland gave it to me  What's my Star Wars?  I do  Does Anthony have his?  Oh, everybody does  There's four people raising their hands  Now you gotta pick  Those are mine  What's my choices?  Don't touch me  Paul, Iraq, Sam, and Travis  Iraq, definitely not  They should earn it  How about they earn it tomorrow?  It's between Travis and Paul  Why not me?  Wait  He just gave it to Paul  That means he didn't really want it  I didn't say I was giving it to Paul  It's between Travis and Paul  How come not me? 
[03:32:30]  Be honest  Well, Paul wasn't reading my mind properly today  So I give it to Travis  I was trying to do a Tony Bennett bit  But he wasn't reading my mind properly  Ah, you're right  You know what?  That cost him  The whole bit was to play four seconds of Tony Bennett  And go, okay, that's enough  Oh, yeah, he fucked up that  He sabotaged you  And you don't like it  Who's got  What are you doing with your Star Wars?  I'll watch it  I want to see the first three  I've never seen them  If I don't like it, I'll give a break  I might have some Star Wars fans in my family  Take it back from Travis 
[03:33:00]  Sometimes when we touch  Family's more important than co-workers  We're practically family  We spend so much time together  Blood is  Thicker than something  I like the smell of a good  Your family's gonna get pissed at you  They're gonna be like, you serious?  You know what's sad is?  I would give it back to him right now  You should  No, no, enjoy it, Travis  He's not gonna watch it  You enjoy it  Enjoy it  Thanks, Opie  Forget the family  It's all about you  Exactly, yeah, be selfish  No, don't turn them off  Leave them on  Oh 
[03:33:30]  Come on, we need that Opie radio  That Opie rage  Opie rage  Bye, Opie  Bye, Jim  Bye, Jim  I guess what we'll do now is  See, sometimes  They haven't done this in a while  But sometimes they just end the show  But they don't end the show  They just leave  I mean, it's not the after show yet  So  What's that?  Y-Rock, you're gonna leave?  Yeah, I'm just gonna go to the bathroom  Bye, Sam  You have to go take a piss?  I mean, wait  You're gonna leave me in the studio alone like it's a bit? 
[03:34:00]  I'll just take the show over  This doesn't matter  Or  What I'll do is  Because I'm smarter than you  Is I'll turn the mics off  And make you look like an asshole  For not being on your position  Stupid  Alright  I'm sorry for saying such hurtful words  Paul  You lost  Yes, I did  I'll talk to you about that  On the after show  Coming up next  The virus  Sirius XM  Hey, hey, hey  And now  The Opie and Anthony show continues 
[03:34:30]  This is After ONA Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  After Opie and Anthony Live  What's that noise?  Are you still doing this?  Roland  For the entire commercial break  For no reason  Like, Roland is just an obnoxious guy  Our talent booker  And for no reason 
[03:35:00]  While E-Rock  Was in the producer's studio  There's a  A pane of  Soundproof glass  That separates our studio  From the studio that E-Rock sits in  Roland  Was  Sitting next to the window  And  Pounding on the window  As hard as he could  Over and over again  For the entire commercial break  Why?  Why were you doing that? 
[03:35:30]  I'm hungry  And I don't know  Eric, was that annoying?  Um  You just see him  Flailing against the  The glass there  But you don't know  You can't hear it in there?  Why he's fucking doing it  It's very faint  Cause it's resonating  Against the walls in here  Like I can hear it  On this wall  That's farther away  From the window  Yeah  Sometimes Roland  Just does things  Because he's a dick  For no reason  He was swearing  That it was gonna annoy you  But you couldn't even hear him  I was watching him  Just move his arms  Back and forth  Back and forth  And Sal  The intern is in here 
[03:36:00]  And he goes  Is he gonna keep doing that?  I go  Guess so  And then Roland's doing  Double fisting on the windows  Oh  Even Sal the intern  Thinks you're a psychopath  Already  So it's the second week  Oh Sal  If you're just  This is the after show  Of course  I mean you might have  Gotten confused  Because Opie and Anthony  Decided to leave  The show  Without  Actually  Turning the mics off  Once again today  But that was still O and A  This is now after  Opie and Anthony live  I'm Sam Roberts  And I mean  If you're just tuning in now 
[03:36:30]  And you missed any of the show  I mean  You missed  A major bit  You missed  The Opie Star Wars Blu-ray giveaway  Which I mean  Was just  I  I missed it  Cause I was upstairs  Waiting for guests  He said  He said  Who wants this  Star Wars Blu-ray  I don't think I'm gonna watch it  Cause he's got a kid  He's got too much stuff to do  And  I raised my hand  Simultaneously  Travis raised his hand 
[03:37:00]  And then in the other room  Paul  And the sex bagel  Raised their hands  The first one  Out of the gate  Was Eric  The second one  Out of the gate  Meaning out of the competition  That's wrong  Out of the competition  Was Eric  The second one  Out of the competition  For some reason  Was me  Now that leads me  To believe  Eric  I mean  It's been no secret  That you and I  Have hung out with Opie  Like probably more  Than anybody else has  Yeah  Like he treats  His friends poorly 
[03:37:30]  Fair assessment  I think that that is  What we learn from this  Because immediately  The first two  He can eliminate  Are the two people  That he has  Actually hung out with  On a social basis  That talks to him  When the mics are off  Right  Like the people  Who actually like  Call him and everything  But so Paul and Travis  Are left  And then Paul  You  I think he would have  Given it to you  Because  It seemed like  It was going that way  Because this is  What I know  Like he sees you  As like that  The go-getter  Young  Like he used to see me 
[03:38:00]  Yeah  Like before  Like when I was just  Coming in  For free  When you still had  Homes and dreams  And I was like  Yeah I'm gonna  Get on this show  I'm gonna  Like that's when  He was like  Yeah  And now it's like  You know  He  It's like a puppy  Like I've grown into  A full-sized dog  And I'm not the fun puppy  Like Marley and me  Exactly  Like he's ready to put me down  Because you know  It's a shame  But it's time  Yeah  That's right  That's exactly right  Whereas you  You're the puppy  Yeah 
[03:38:30]  You're the hungry little dog  Who just needs Opie to feed him  I just want to be pet  Right  You just want to be pet  You'll go cuddle up on Jim's leg  Cuddle up on Ant's leg  Jump in Opie's lap  Whatever it takes  You just need some affection  God that stinks  Well that's Roland for you  I'm hungry  What was breakfast this morning Roland  Not a goddamn thing  What did you have for dinner last night  Um  Dinner  Dinner  Dinner  Uh  Beef ribs  Beef  A lot of them  No only uh  Five  Okay  Um  The baby back  But yeah 
[03:39:00]  But then he said  What cost you  Was  You fucking up today  On the board  Yeah I totally did  Now  That was my first shot too  I wanted to be impressed  No I was gonna say something  Who got the blu-rays  You  So it was Anthony and Jim  Took the blu-rays  And then he gave it to Travis  Oh  You're not happy about that  Well I am gonna  Turn this thing around in a minute  Cause I figured out a plan  But  You  I thought were the phone screener  Uh yes  Amongst other things  So how could you fuck up on the board 
[03:39:30]  Eric had to shit  So  So you lost the Star Wars blu-ray  Because Eric had to shit  Because Eric had to shit  Yes  Eric  I had a potty emergency  Your potty emergency  They were over an hour and a half  They still hadn't taken a break  But they were winding down  You knew they were gonna break soon  Yeah it seemed like it  And here's what I told Paul  And Paul can attest to this  It seems like they were winding down  And Paul goes  Cause he knows how to run the profit  And the let and all that stuff 
[03:40:00]  And he goes  Just go  While we're on the board  I go  Yeah but my luck  The second that I go  And this was maybe 15 minutes  Before I left  I said my luck  They're gonna wanna play something  Going into break  And I'm not gonna be there  And there's gonna be a problem  And then right at that point  I was like  I couldn't wait anymore  And it seemed like  Alright they're going to break  I said Paul can you take this  Yeah no problem  I run out  And then come back to find out  That Paul screwed up something  On the  On Tony Bennett  They didn't mention your name  For an hour and a half  Until the minute you left  That studio for three minutes 
[03:40:30]  That's always my luck  Um  How come you had to shit so bad  I don't know  It just kinda hit me  What was breakfast  Did you have something early this morning  No I didn't have anything before  Okay well then what was dinner  Uh  What was dinner  Dinner was  Oh I only had one thing yesterday  It was in two meals though  But it  Um  We had uh  Cheeseburger from Houlihan's  The entire cow  I never ate the whole thing  And then I had it later  Wow  So all you ate yesterday  Was one cheeseburger  It was a cheeseburger  From Houlihan's  They're big though  How big  They're like five patties  No they're not 
[03:41:00]  You ate five patties with cheese  No I don't know where  Roland's going to eat  That's his  Eric did confess to me  When he came back  That he just made it  To the bathroom  So if he'd stay here  As soon as that  As soon as the lid went down  I was like  Oh thank god  Was it solid  Or was it drippy  It was both  Did you ever call it drippy  When you were a kid  No  I did  No drippy was not  It's called the Houlihan special  It looked like Alpo  Yeah  It just would come out  In the sludge  Are you sure you're not  Sleep eating  And having cans of Alpo  At night 
[03:41:30]  I'm positive  Alright  Well listen  I have figured out  And are you  You're taking this in stride  It seems  Even though  E-Roc's Alpo shits  Whoa  That sure has wheels  E-Roc's Alpo shits  Cost you  A Star Wars Blu-ray  And not just  The  One of the two  Trilogies  Oh no  Both trilogies  The entire saga  Plus  Two bonus discs  And you can't get those  Bonus discs  Unless you get both  Trilogies  Oh I had no idea  About the bonus discs  That's right  I saw it in  Walmart yesterday 
[03:42:00]  And it has  It's $80  And has  For now  90 minutes  Of Star Wars spoofs  Really?  I don't know  Where they got all  Those Star Wars spoofs from  Is the Christmas special  On there?  No the Christmas special  Is not on there  Lucasfilm does not  Acknowledge  The Christmas special  But E-Roc's  E-Roc's  Doggy shits  Cost you that  That Blu-ray  Do you have a Blu-ray player?  Of course I do  PS3 is a Blu-ray player  Listen  Here's what I'm gonna do  I'm gonna offer Travis 
[03:42:30]  The chance to  To flip this Blu-ray  Right now  To do the right thing  Because  I'm saying this  Right here  And I'm saying it on the air  Everybody's gonna hear it  Right here  On After Opie and Anthony Live  If Travis comes down  To this studio  And gives me  The Star Wars Blu-ray saga  The whole box set  That Opie just gave him  I'll give him $15 today  Cash  Cash  Now wait a second  $15  You said to make it right  And you're gonna give him  $15 cash  Cash  In hand 
[03:43:00]  I'll show you the $15  I know you don't  You probably don't believe me  I'll show you the $15  See it's  $10 out of $5  Okay  Cash  Rolling you see it  How much is this?  $5  And  There's a $10  $15 right now  For the Blu-ray  Now  Travis come on down  And make it $15  Hold on  I gotta ask  Okay  This is to make it right  For me  So the Blu-rays would go  To me  We'll figure out  What happens  With that  After that 
[03:43:30]  I mean  I could email the guy  And again  Another Blu-ray for myself  And just  Let it sit on my desk  Well I'm gonna tell you this  If you do that  The offer goes to you  $15  I mean  Think about it this way  $40  Travis walked out of here  Walked into the building today  Let's make a deal  Oh  Oh  I was like  What is that noise  A bed  Travis walked into this building  With  X amount of dollars  In his pocket 
[03:44:00]  Knowing this place  Probably zero  Yeah  Right  He was sure  He was given a Blu-ray  But what's a Blu-ray worth  Nothing  I mean  It's a movie  You can't  You can't go to the grocery store  And give people a Blu-ray  For a bag of tomatoes  It can't happen  Nobody will accept it  Not on this country  Not in any country  But  If Travis walks in here  Right now  And hands over that Blu-ray box set  He will have  $15  They didn't walk out in  And Paul  He got that box set for free  That's 100% profit 
[03:44:30]  Where in business  Can you find a deal  Where you can make  100% profit  That is the deal  I'm offering  It's a limited time basis  $15  For the Star Wars Blu-ray  Collection thing  I don't see him  Coming down the hall  I don't understand  I don't see him moving at all  Yeah I don't understand why  I thought we made this  Clear  I gotta  I see  He waved  I see him down the hall  He waved for a second  I don't know if that means  Hold on a sec  Leave the deal on the table 
[03:45:00]  Because  Travis  $15  With your name on it  In exchange  For the Star Wars Blu-ray collection  That Opie just gave you  Not to  Outdo you Sam  Yeah  But  I'm willing to offer  $20  You don't have $20  Let me see the $20  Let me see the $20  I do have $20  Travis he's gonna rip you off  Don't do it  Let me see the $20  Travis knows I'm good for it  I have $1 in my wallet  Okay  No that's all I have  No deal  No deal  Because Paul  What you don't understand is 
[03:45:30]  Here's a $5  And  Here's the $10  $15  In cash  To Travis  Right now  Not  I'll give you $20 later  You know  That doesn't work  That doesn't work  Okay  Okay  $15 in hand  For that Star Wars Blu-ray collection  And I'm assuming  He'll be coming down the  I'm assuming  He'll be coming down the hall  He's not  Eric  Wait a minute 
[03:46:00]  Wait a minute  What do you got in here  How much money is that  I am willing to make a cash offer  Uh huh  For Travis' Star Wars Blu-ray set  Of how much  Well Paul has  I believe he said a dollar  One  One dollar  I'm willing to up the ante  Well $15 right now  And I am going with $6  Well that doesn't make any sense  Does it really  You're offering less than I offered  I think he'll go for it though  I have $6 right here waiting  I got a better idea  I'm offering zero  Bitch slap him  Take him back 
[03:46:30]  As I got it for him  So now I'm taking him back  Alright go grab it  Go grab it from him  Eric's banking on Travis  Liking him more  Which  Just  Liking him more  No I'm banking on that  He'll want to undercut Sam  Oh that's a good point actually  I don't care if it goes to me or you  You're banking  Then we can combine ours  And make it $7  Let's make it $7  We can share  You guys don't understand something  You're still dealing  With $8  That goes unaccounted for  He doesn't like  He might like you more than he likes me  But he doesn't like you more than $8  $8? 
[03:47:00]  $8  I said $15  I'm not a cheapo like you guys  Well  Well you're throwing out this price of $8  When clearly Eric and I already discussed it  We have  Another potential investor  We only have $7 between us  Alright and what do you get when you add $8?  Well then you get $15  Well now you know where the $8 comes from  Mathematician  Paul we're in luck  Oh hold on  Because we have another person who wants to go in on the Star Wars Blu-ray set  Okay who's that?  And that would be Sal the intern  Oh you motherfucker 
[03:47:30]  So to our $7 we will add $18 additional dollars  Wow  Bringing it to $25  Wait wait wait  So who gets the  But that's three of you  So who gets the discs?  I would give it to Sal the intern  Since he doesn't make any money here  Well you would also say that  Because you only put in a dollar  So it doesn't matter  Yes  You might as well take your dollar out  He said he'll just take it on the weekend  And then we can split the week with it  Sort of like Radioactive Man number one  Okay  Yeah but then it's going to end up getting ripped up or something 
[03:48:00]  It's going to be worthless in the end  Sharing doesn't work  Hmm  Well I'm assuming Travis  $25 is on the table  $15 is on the table  That's $25 combined  It doesn't count  $15 is on the table  So I'm assuming Travis is in a meeting right now  So he'll probably come back a little later  I would think  I mean I'm looking  And yes I think he's  He must be in a meeting  So a little later in the show  He'll come to collect the $15  In exchange  Oh  Is the meeting over?  Because I see him walking 
[03:48:30]  Alright let me get the $15 out  Let me get this $15 out  Hold on I gotta go grab that $25  No no no no  That's a combined effort  That doesn't count  Sure it does  Okay is he holding the DVD?  There's a Blu-ray disc  He does not appear to be  No that's his phone  You're not holding the Blu-ray set  Did you not hear the offer that was on the table?  I heard the offer  Here it is  I don't know if you believe it or not  But how much money is this?  That looks like $15  Is that real money? 
[03:49:00]  That's a $10 out of $5  And that's yours in exchange for the Blu-ray  So if you could just hand it over  And is that including shipping?  Well you don't have to ship it to me  You just hand it to me  I'm here  It's all the way back in the office though  I'll go get it  What's that Paul?  Oh this is $24  Alright let's combine it then  And you give that to me  And then we'll make it  Now it's $25  Now we all like Star Wars right?  Yes  How many people do we have here?  1, 2, 3, 4 
[03:49:30]  Sal  You 5  Eric  Yeah 9  I see what you did there  So how about we all just take our favorite movie?  Alright only thing is  And we share  Because we're all going to fight over Empire  Because we all know  I'll take episode 3  Alright  What?  Eric's got episode 3  Eric your favorite Star Wars movie is episode 3?  Isn't that the one he tried to put the Backstreet Boys into?  What?  I don't know anything about that Paul  That's absolutely true  That's some Backstreet Boy trivia that you know from joining the fan club  That's some George Lucas trivia 
[03:50:00]  I consider the original trilogy to be one movie  So I will take that  Okay  So that's fair right?  Is this one story?  That's kind of one story  Yeah I consider that  And then Eric can have episode 3  And then you two  Sal gets nothing  And he lost his $18  And then you and  If you say no to this whole deal  I just made $24  Cool  Alright no deal  Okay  Wait so how does Travis get $24?  No I just made $24  Oh good for you 
[03:50:30]  Well then let's give a round of applause  Paul wins  Let's make a deal  Wait a minute  Congratulations  And Paul you can come over and we'll watch Star Wars  Oh sweet  But  Snacks are on Paul am I right?  He's got the $24  You got $24 for it  Well you got $25 technically  You made $24  Alright well I guess I'll just steal it from you later  I'll try to  I mean maybe I'll be interested in the offer later  Yeah I mean  Maybe if I get hungry I don't have any cash on me  That's what I'm banking on  Do you have cash on you?  I have $2  That's not going to buy me lunch 
[03:51:00]  That's not going to buy you lunch  No  And I'm going to try to undercut you if that's the case  Oh undercut you  That's right  That's right  I'm going to try to offer it to you for cheaper  So Tony Bennett was in today  Yes  Big thrill for everybody  But for me what was the most thrilling thing was him just giving Ant and Jim nothing  In the beginning of the interview on what they were going for  Like Jim  You have to listen to this interview  The great Tony Bennett was in here  And the replay obviously starts at 3 Eastern  But Jim started the interview trying to ask Tony Bennett if Liberace was gay 
[03:51:30]  Tony Bennett had no idea what he was saying  And Jim had to ask him about half a dozen times  I couldn't see him  Was it  He could actually not hear him  Or was he just kind of fucking with him a little bit  If Roland's around  Roland can come back in here  I miss him  But um  Yeah no no no  He couldn't hear him  Jim thought he was joking around at first  But uh  Tony Bennett couldn't hear him at all 
[03:52:00]  And Jim  Because Jim was kind of being like  You know  People know he was  And Tony Bennett was like  What a piano player?  And I was like  No uh  But um  It was hilarious  What I found interesting too though  Do you think  Eric you've been here a long time  Was that the biggest celebrity we've had up here?  I was  You know they asked that during the break  I've been trying to dig through and see  But he's definitely up there  I don't  Yeah  I feel like there's been bigger than Tony Bennett  But I can't place my finger on who it would be 
[03:52:30]  That's why I wanted Roland to come in  Because he's booked everybody  And um  Maybe it's just because Tony Bennett hasn't affected us  Because we're younger  But  Who  Other than Tony Bennett  Has been at least big-ish  Like who  Who would even be competition?  I'm pulling up a list right now  I'm looking  You don't remember?  No  Not off the top of my head  As far as music goes  Anyone  I mean just guests  They said guests  Well I mean  It's hard to compare like Hollywood 
[03:53:00]  Actors and stuff to  Famous  Legendary musicians  Like we've had Ron Howard on  Who's huge  But he's not bigger than a Tony Bennett  Yeah Ron Howard isn't bigger than Tony Bennett  Is he?  Let's see what  Oh he was  He was Opie  Opie is the only Opie  You know  Let's see  Yeah but  I mean he's not  He's not as iconic as Tony Bennett is  Uh  There's a long list of people that we've had 
[03:53:30]  Did we ever  We did that  None that are standing out more than Tony Bennett  We did that A-lister special right?  Yeah  Yeah I mean there wasn't anybody on that special bigger than Tony Bennett  Than Tony Bennett  Yeah  Not that I'm seeing off the top here  I mean that  That's a huge  Huge get  Do you agree with  Because they  I feel  What I disagree with though  Is I think Paul McCartney is way bigger than Tony Bennett  Like I think if Paul McCartney was in here  Yeah but  It would be a way bigger deal  They're talking in the mindset of  You know 
[03:54:00]  Tony Bennett was big before the Beatles were even out  So he's kind of  You know  More of a legendary status than Paul McCartney has  Yeah but that's just time put in  That's time served  That doesn't count  I think  That  Paul McCartney is more of an icon than Tony Bennett is  I mean  And I mean maybe  Paul McCartney would be excited to meet Tony Bennett  Because they're in the same industry  But I think Paul McCartney is bigger  I'm just going based on  Just on music right now 
[03:54:30]  And athletes  And I'm not seeing anybody that comes up  That's bigger than Tony Bennett  Well Dennis Rodman would be bigger than Tony Bennett  If we ever had him in here  Don't you  No  You don't think that's the case  No  Oh  I mean do you remember when he dyed his hair all crazy colors  Yeah it was like three or four colors  Right  Yeah  So even  What about the piercings  Uh no  Okay so still not Dennis Rodman  Let me throw this out there  And see  Carlin  You think Carlin  Okay  This is a great  This is something great brought to the table  Is George Carlin bigger than Tony Bennett 
[03:55:00]  Because it's hard  Especially  I mean George Carlin's not living anymore  But when he was living  He would have had to have been the greatest living comic  Um  And even now  I would put him in  I think everybody would put him in the top whatever of all time  Maybe  Top three  Top one  It's always one and two is him and Pryor  Right  Yeah  So I don't know many people  I mean Tony Bennett affected more people than George Carlin  Um  But that's because  I would say definitely  That's because Tony Bennett was uh 
[03:55:30]  More of a mainstream performer than George Carlin  I guess  If they were walking down the street  Would it be a bigger  It's hard for us I think too  Yeah  It's hard for me anyway because  We used to see Tony Bennett  In his dumb track suit  Walking down 57th street every day  And so  And I mean like  I remember  When uh  When Obama  When that election was going on  I went out with a couple of the interns  To interview people at polling places  And we went up to the polling place 
[03:56:00]  Right around the XM studio  And Tony Bennett went in to vote  And uh  And granted us a dumb interview afterwards  So it's like  He seems too accessible  Like I've had way too many interactions  With Tony Bennett  For him to be this big of a deal  But I guess you forget  How massive he is  Hold on  What about Joe Frazier?  Joe Frazier  Do you think he'd be up there?  I mean  I would  I  He's worldwide known  Yeah  Joe Frazier is  But he's not like 
[03:56:30]  Ali  Yeah  You know what I mean?  Maybe  Ali's probably bigger than Tony Bennett  But I don't know if Joe Frazier is  I'm still looking through the guest list here  Of everyone we had  And we usually don't take phone calls Paul  But we'll go to Greg  Greg you're on the after show  Yeah  I think it's Malcolm McDowell's bigger  Malcolm McDowell  Well  Hmm  And Bob  That they had Brian Johnson in there  That was huge  What'd you say?  Brian Johnson  Brian Johnson in there too  Well that was a big segment 
[03:57:00]  Yeah  But I don't know if  Malcolm McDowell is a bigger  Get than  Than Tony Bennett  Tony Bennett  Especially  Like  He did a few iconic movies  But then he's done a lot of shitty movies  Since then  He's such a cult guy though  You know what I mean?  Yeah he's very culty  There is a very huge cult following behind him  Whereas  Tony Bennett is not culty at all  He's very iconic  Which is different  Yeah I can't say Malcolm McDowell's bigger than Tony Bennett  He's huge  But I can't say he's bigger 
[03:57:30]  So I guess  And along those lines  Like you know  Like Ozzy wouldn't be  Bigger than Tony Bennett  I feel like the only  Who's  I think Paul McCartney's bigger than Tony Bennett  Tom Jones maybe?  Hmm  No  He's too kitschy I think  Okay  Like Tony Bennett still has  Like Tony Bennett's not gonna  Make fun of himself on the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air  Yeah  Whereas Tom Jones is lucky to do that  Yeah  Alright  You know  I would put Tom Jones above Wayne Newton  Who we also had in studio 
[03:58:00]  But uh  I don't think I would put either of them above  Uh  What's his name?  Um  Yeah  I don't think  I think they might be right  I'm not  Yeah  Because Ozzy is  Like I said  You have Ron Howard  Who is you know  Legendary as well  But not at that peak of Tony Bennett  Okay  I'm just getting a text  And this could be right  Uh  This text  And this  I mean this is coming from the source  He knows the show  Uh  Loverboy 
[03:58:30]  Is bigger than Tony Bennett  That's sent in by  Anthony Cumia  So I've  Yeah  Alright  Loverboy is a little bigger  But  Let's be honest  Loverboy was an after show guest  Yeah I was gonna say  Did Loverboy just do the shit hour?  If we're talking about  The biggest guest in after show history  It's gonna be Loverboy  But  If you're talking about ONA history  I mean ONA never managed to get Loverboy  Did they?  No  You're asking me  They played clips from the after show  But they never got Loverboy in studio 
[03:59:00]  Um  Everybody's going  Somebody said Stone Cold Steve Austin  Well actually  Uh  Our new intern Sal  He wrote it up  As the phone screener  And he wrote  Stone Clawed Steve Austin  Way to go Sal  Um  Tony  Yeah what about Sugar Ray Leonard?  That's a great  That's  Again  I don't think  Well Sugar Ray Leonard  I don't think he's bigger than Joe Frazier  No  No  I would definitely say not  And since Joe Frazier  Is not bigger than Tony Bennett  Mmhmm 
[03:59:30]  How could  Sugar Ray Leonard  Be bigger than Tony Bennett?  It doesn't happen  It doesn't  Uh  So I guess  Other than after show guests  There's been a few after show guests  That are bigger than Tony Bennett  Um  I would say  The Russian Dolls  And  Loverboy  Are both bigger than Tony Bennett  Eric is that right?  Uh  No I don't think so  You don't think the Russian Dolls  Are bigger than Tony Bennett?  I don't even think the show's still on  Yeah but it was big when it was on  For like a couple episodes  For the few weeks that it was on  Yeah I mean that was a big show 
[04:00:00]  So I  I would say the Russian Dolls  Are a little bigger  And Loverboy obviously is bigger  So  I mean  But that's the after show caliber of guests  You know  That's not what we're talking about  We're trying  We're talking about the guys  Who come by O&A  Not the A-listers  Who show up  On after Open Anthony Live  You know what I mean?  Like not every show  Yeah  Gets the Russian Dolls  And the Mob Wives  Still going through this list here  I'm not seeing anybody  That stands out more than Tony Bennett  I don't think there is  But  Uh  Eric  I'm stuck with something here 
[04:00:30]  Okay  Paul  Tried to  Undercut me  And get that  Star Wars Blu-ray  That is correct  But he also wants to plug something  That's for a good cause  I think that may  Cost you some money  Oh  Wait wait wait wait wait  Hotline  Uh  Just  Leave it alone  After O&A  Hey Sam  I'm sorry to interrupt  But I need to plug something  It's never an interruption 
[04:01:00]  Does everybody know  That you got t-shirts now?  Don't plug the t-shirts  What the  Kenny  We gotta go  There's another guest here  The great Ron Bennington has arrived  I like the nickname  In the studio  I hope it really catches on  And we now have a bigger guest than Tony Bennett  And that's Ron Bennington  How was it meeting Tony Bennett?  It was great having him in studio  And even Stephen Wright was in here at the same time  And he was just talking about how surreal it was 
[04:01:30]  It was amazing  Well he's surreal  That's the weird thing to say  It's surreal  I see Tony in this neighborhood all the time  Yeah  We were just talking about how it's like  We have trouble seeing him  As like the massive star that he is  Because we see him walking around in his track suit  You know  He's always working out  He works out quite a bit  Well he's in great shape for 85  Is he 85?  Yeah  85 years young  Years young  Yeah  Yeah it was great  I don't know if you heard it  But we were talking about it  Jim  One of the first questions was asking him 
[04:02:00]  Did all of you in the industry know Liberace was gay?  But he kind of mumbled the gay thing  So Tony Bennett goes  Knew he was what?  And Jim goes  You know like  And Tony goes  No what?  And Jim goes  Whoa  You know gay  Well you're mumbling  What are you saying?  Ask him like four times  And then there was another moment  When they were talking about  The old days of Las Vegas  Yeah  And Ant goes  Tony was talking about  You know the way they would  Treat them or whatever 
[04:02:30]  And Ant goes  You know and then you may have to come back  And do a favor for me  You know doing a godfather line  And Tony looked at him like  What are you talking about?  And he was like  Godfather line  But yeah apparently  In the industry  They did know that Liberace was gay  Well I'm glad that that broke today  Because it's important  But the  You know there's always been  Gay people around  Yeah of course  And they were always accepted  By show business people  Like show business people  Are just like  Yes we need gay people 
[04:03:00]  Someone has to make these costumes  And these sets  So they were always well respected  Yeah  But then because  And the fact that it didn't get out  Is that those guys knew  This is a career owner  And I'm not going to  Hurt this guy  You know they were almost like  Circus people  Were like  Bring us the outsiders  And it took like 40 years  Before you could even tell the public  40 or 50 years  Before you could tell anyone  Like for whatever reason  Hollywood would be like  Yeah we need you  You're on board 
[04:03:30]  We get it  But the general public said  No!  Well there's a little thing  Called the Bible  Is that what it was?  That really kind of  Slows down critical thinking  And Hollywood  Say goodbye to the Bible  A long time ago  Hollywood  And I think this is their  To their credit  Says nothing comes before  The show and the ratings  Yeah  You know what I mean  They put business first  Yeah but they also put art first  So they're like  Look we get it  You know you  Farmers are going to have 
[04:04:00]  A problem with this  Still  You know it becomes  That thing of like  When you're a carny  You give people  An experience  It may not be the experience  They think they're getting  You know what I mean  Right  But they don't leave there  With nothing  They leave learning  A fucking lesson  So isn't it kind of funny  That women were  Like swooning around  Liberace at one time  Yeah  I mean just how  Now you act like  That's the end of it  But remember when  American Idol came out  In like the second season 
[04:04:30]  The gay guy  Clay Aiken  And these women  Followed him around  They called themselves  Claymates  And everyone was like  Everybody knew  What are you doing  Yeah but they wouldn't  They held to it  It was the same thing  With NSYNC  When everybody was like  Lance Bass  He's my favorite  All the girls  When are the other four  Going to come out  I don't know  Especially that JT  I mean everybody knows  Everyone in that band  Blew fucking Lance Bass  I mean Joey Fatone  Was in here  It was obvious  To everybody in the room  That he was gay  Yeah 
[04:05:00]  Obvious  I didn't know this  See I didn't know this  Yeah everybody  We were talking about  Whether or not  We've ever had a celebrity  On the show  Bigger than Tony Bennett too  Uh no  And yeah we can't  Nobody  Tony Bennett is  The closest we got  Was Anthony texting in  When Loverboy was in here  That was huge  Yeah  But Tony Bennett  The thing is  Here's the weird thing  About Tony Bennett  He also was never  Like part of any kind of  Rat Packer scene  He just went around  Doing the Tony Bennett thing 
[04:05:30]  Didn't feel like  He needed to do comedy  And act  To just like  Let me sing my fucking songs  He's also a terrific artist  Yeah  Great great painter  Oh yeah he's doing that  Yeah  I haven't seen any  He's always done it  He's always painted  Tony Bennett  When he's in a New York restaurant  He only goes in by himself  Uh huh  And doesn't like to eat  With other people  And he's sketching  He doesn't bring his wife  Or anything  No  He's there by himself  Just sketching  Yes  He doesn't like the idea  Of somebody being there 
[04:06:00]  When he eats  That's amazing  No more like  When you take a shit  You like to do it alone  Yeah no  Please let me have my time  There's you and your wrestling dolls  And you're working everything out  Yeah well I gotta  Occupy myself somehow  What's with uh  Triple H attacking the MMA  Why didn't he do that on your show  I wish he had  And you could have blown up with that  Yeah I don't know  He said that uh  The UFC  Did everyone know that Pat Patterson  Was gay  Yeah  Did everyone bring that up  Everybody knew that right  But there's another  Great example  Everyone in wrestling  Know it  Yeah  They took care of it 
[04:06:30]  Yeah whatever  You know just  We need you  I always wondered  Would I have the courage  If I worked with someone  That was gay  Would I have the courage  I don't know  To accept them  I don't know if it happens  In radio where  I don't think it does  It's never happened before  In radio  It's like everybody kind of knows  And inside the industry  It's confirmed  But you don't want to say it  Although to be confirmed  Don't you have to actually do it  I guess so  Does that not  I don't think it does  But we're starting to get very specific  Yeah but see the thing is  Alright let's say 
[04:07:00]  Dave  Now we know he masturbates  To Angelina Jolie  Sure  Doesn't mean he's fucked  Angelina Jolie  That's correct  So in his mind  He could act like  That's my girlfriend  Right  It's not  That could be the best point  I've ever heard  Because the experience  Hasn't happened  You've got to do it  Right  Just like  Haven't you guys had  Murder fucking fantasies before  Absolutely  Doesn't make you a murderer  They can't take you into court  Yeah  And you know  Believe me  He sat there  And thought about choking out 
[04:07:30]  I'll just use the name  Rob Cross  I'll just throw that out there  I saw the town  And all I was doing  Was saying  You know  I bet me and my buddies  Could pull a bank robbery off  We could do  Every man fantasizes  About a bank robbery  Right  In his life  But I'm not a bank robber  And by the way  You and your friends  Couldn't pull it off  You guys could not  Fucking  Rob a Circle K  Or a Wawa  We'd have wrestling masks on  Instead of the presidents  Or whatever  It's actually a pretty good premise  Yeah  It's a good bit  Face paint on and stuff  That would actually be good 
[04:08:00]  You know  There's some guy  Apparently he got too  Into the Dexter thing  Uh huh  And he's going around places  Pretending that he's Dexter  And what always kills me  Is that the entertainment business  Will go  Look  We know this  This is just entertainment  Why are you making a big deal out of it  But if you watched any of the Emmys  Last night  Uh huh  And why wouldn't you  The Eagles game was on  Um  The people from Modern Family  Believe  That people watch their show  And become more accepting  Yeah  Yet if you say 
[04:08:30]  Yeah but then we watched Helter Skelter  And the kids went out  And fucking Columbine  No  That never happens  They like when they can cash in on it  But then when it's time to  Look it's just a TV show  What are you nuts  Yeah  Come on  And the movies  Everyone does  The rap songs  Everybody fucking will  Want all the positive  Yeah  They want all the credit  For We Are All The World  Yeah  None of the blame for  Fuck The Police  No  Well I mean  I think people maybe are  Positively influenced by music  And movies and television  But never on the negative side
