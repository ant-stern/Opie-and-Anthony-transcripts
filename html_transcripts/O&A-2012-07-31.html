<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous discussion of the 2012 London Olympics.  The hosts provided highly detailed, sexually explicit commentary on the physiques of Olympic divers, focusing on genitalia and pubic hair visibility, along with crude jokes about the divers' attire and post-dive jacuzzi scenes.  This extended to other events like women's volleyball and water polo, again featuring sexually explicit observations about the athletes' bodies. They also commented on the apparent lack of Black athletes in water sports, attributing it to socioeconomic factors,  discussed the perceived value of Olympic medals, and shared a bizarre anecdote about a bronze medalist damaging his medal.  Caller Jeff from Austin brought up Federica Pellegrini's attractiveness, sparking a comparison with other female athletes, including one Paraguayan Olympian deemed exceptionally attractive by the hosts.  A failed attempt to find images of U.S. women's water polo players' pubic hair online ensued, followed by a caller, Bill from Rhode Island, sharing information about swimmers ingesting pool water before races.  The hosts also discussed alleged bribery in Japanese gymnastics, accompanied by further sexually explicit commentary on female athletes' appearances, and concluded this segment with a game guessing women-only Olympic events.


The next segment began with a discussion of a PG-rated show's on-air mishap, followed by news about Linda McMahon's political run and a purported creature found under the Brooklyn Bridge.  After speculating about its identity (initially monstrous, then settling on a pig), the conversation shifted back to the Olympics, highlighting the broadcast delays and absurdity of live East Coast broadcasts before the West Coast.  In-studio guest Jimmy Norton detailed his uncomfortable experience undergoing a sleep study, including descriptions of sleep apnea masks, accompanied by numerous off-color jokes.  The show then covered a WWE broadcast gaffe involving an off-color joke about Kobe Bryant and the subsequent apology.  This led to a discussion of Artie Lange's suspension from *Nick and Artie* for urinating in the studio, including playing audio of Lange's explanation (citing Type 2 diabetes) and discussing his deleted Twitter comments.  The segment concluded with analysis of John Sterling's Ichiro home run call, playing the audio and critiquing its phrasing, perceived awkwardness, and potential racial insensitivity, followed by more Olympic discussion and promotion of their Chicago appearance.  The language throughout this segment remained highly vulgar and sexually suggestive.


The third segment centered on a bizarre $1,000 contest for overweight women to participate in a "pig race," with discussion on the lack of entrants and comparing "fatties" versus "hot girls."  A substantial portion focused on a favorite pizza place in a "ghetto" New Rochelle neighborhood, contrasted with their affluent Westchester County surroundings. This led to a wide-ranging discussion comparing different areas of Westchester, Boston, and other locations,  including detailed accounts of the pizza place,  parking difficulties, a dislike of couscous,  the merits of Walter's Hot Dogs and other Westchester eateries,  listener Ari's upcoming stand-up shows, a frightening New Rochelle experience, drug use (mushrooms and LSD), and a debate on diners and fast food.  The segment concluded with abandoned plans for a "Westchester food tour," upcoming food deliveries,  brief mentions of Olympic skeet shooting and a past encounter with Joe Rogan, and a short exchange with caller Bobo about missed tweets.


The following segment featured a conversation with guest Ari Shaffir about growing up Orthodox Jewish, including his time in Israel and subsequent rejection of the faith.  Shaffir discussed the strictures of Orthodox Judaism, focusing on rules around menstruation and sexual activity, his parents' reaction, and memories of Yeshiva life.  Anecdotes included a humorous incident involving baby shit on Opie's mustache.  The conversation touched upon a Hasidic cocaine smuggler, perceived hypocrisy within the Orthodox community, and difficulties maintaining religious observance.  Caller David (initially from Israel, then revealed to be in Jersey) shared his experiences, including the freedom to use racial slurs in Israel.  There was extensive discussion on ass-eating, including personal experiences. The segment concluded with discussion of Shaffir's podcast, stand-up career, and his brother's gambling addiction.


The final segment focused on Kristen Stewart's attractiveness, dating life (particularly her relationship with Robert Pattinson and an alleged affair), using crude and sexually explicit language.  The age difference between Stewart and the director was discussed, speculating about her motivations.  Artie Lange was mentioned as having a "best appearance" on the show, referencing a "Baby Bird" segment, and his comedic timing and need to use the restroom.  Artie's sleep study was briefly mentioned, including a story about a patient advised to smoke marijuana before a repeat study.  The show concluded with plugs for Ari Shafir's show, the Opie and Anthony Chicago broadcast, Rich Vos, and the end of the current broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, let's do this.  Hi. Morning.  Good morning.  Oh man, what we gotta do?  As soon as we get in here, we just gotta turn the mics on and record shit. 
[00:00:30]  I don't even know if we could do what we were talking about justice.  That's gonna make me laugh all day.  Well, we were.  I came in and I go to Ed.  I was kind of scared to bring it up. I'm gonna be honest with you.  Oh, really?  Well, because it's a little weird.  Well, I think everybody notices.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  We're all watching the Olympics, but we're trying to find those different angles.  Let everyone else talk about the horse shit of winning a stupid gold medal.  Who gives a fuck anymore?  The medal count.  I guess the medal count. We're tied with China, if you do care. 
[00:01:00]  Oh.  Yeah, but they got more gold, I think.  And I was watching that synchronized diving last night.  Because I guess that's all NBC decided to give us for a while.  Yeah, that synchronized diving.  And me and my wife were howling.  Notice I throw her in there, but whatever.  It is the truth.  Hey, whatever.  I was alone.  One of the American synchronized divers had a huge cock.  Yeah.  And he was almost embarrassed of it.  And he was trying to keep it in his tiny, tiny little fucking bathing suit. 
[00:01:30]  Dude, they wear the smallest little fucking bikini bottoms on men.  Look, we're absolutely open-minded when it comes to the whole gay thing.  We really are.  Jesus.  But we also have to be honest.  Synchronized diving has got to be the gayest Olympic sport.  It's pretty gay.  It has to be.  And it's not just one thing.  All right, look.  Two men doing the exact same thing together.  It's weird no matter what.  Especially dressed in little bikinis.  Tiny little bikinis. 
[00:02:00]  And then when they get done, though, they get out and they hug each other.  And then they jump in a little jacuzzi together.  Right.  To warm back up.  And they're splashing and frolicking.  How cold do they keep these Olympic pools that they have to go into a jacuzzi to warm back up?  To warm up.  Here's something.  Keep it all nice and heated.  Nice, right?  But I don't even know if you're going to find video online.  But, I mean, this one American guy, I don't even know who he is.  I don't know his name.  Old big cock McGillicuddy.  But his partner has just either an average or very small cock. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  And then the side view, this fucking thing was just bulging.  It was over the fucking platform.  Yeah, it was sticking out over the platform.  And it was pushing his little bikinis out so much that it was making a space between his thigh and the edge of the fucking little bikini.  So I was ready to see, like, ball sack.  Yeah, you almost saw a fucking ball bag.  It was hilarious.  And then they did the shot where the two Americans, you know, straight on.  And you could see the small triangle bikini bottoms they had both head on. 
[00:03:00]  And the one was so obviously filled more than the other.  Just filled with thick dick.  We were fucking howling, man.  And then they all have wedgies.  Yeah, the wedgie, the fucking ball bag, the big cock.  It's just...  And then you pointed out the Mexican guy, which I swear to you, I did not notice this part.  Yeah, the Mexican, the little Mexican guy in the synchronized diving, he came walking out of the fucking little jacuzzi. 
[00:03:30]  And his little bikini bottoms are so low down that his pubes were sticking over the top.  Live on NBC, huh?  Live right there on NBC.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to file a complaint.  It wasn't even that fucking, you know, under the belly button hair.  Right.  Because that was all nothing.  Right.  And then just a tuft of fucking pubes sticking over the top.  Yeah, you see some of these hairy guys at the beach.  And it's questionable whether it's, like, lower belly hair or their actual pubes. 
[00:04:00]  Or pubes.  It was Mexicali pubes.  That's really funny.  They were just poking out at the top.  El pubos, yeah.  It was just sticking out over the top.  Man, I don't understand what's going on with that sport.  It's a little weird.  It's a little strange.  I don't understand why you have to wear such a tiny, tiny little bottom.  There's no, like, speed in it where you're like, well, they can't wear, like, anything baggier because there's a speed factor.  They're diving.  I mean, you could obviously wear something a little bigger.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  But they love wearing those tiny little bikinis together.  I was just amazed.  I'm like, what is going on here?  Why is this a sport?  The whole thing was weird to me.  It's just a little too familiar with another scantily clad gentleman up there on the platform.  And then, of course, the Chinese win that again.  Yeah.  They're great at synchronizing shit.  Yeah, yeah.  What is that about?  They love synchronizing.  I'll say it again.  I'm convinced they've been cloning in a long time.  Oh, it's... 
[00:05:00]  We can't get in there and actually see what China does.  You know that.  Yeah.  There's rules, but they seem to not really pay attention to rules.  No.  So you've got to think they're probably cloning human beings by now.  Yeah.  And probably why not use it for the Olympics?  Yeah.  You get the exact same guy up there.  He knows exactly what the other guy's going to do.  And it's an old gag, but how would we ever know anyway?  How the hell would we know?  How would we know?  How would we know?  That little fucking...  But then you find yourself getting a little caught up in it. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, that was good.  Yeah.  Oh, they looked exactly the same.  Oh, their third rotation looked pretty close together.  Oh, their entry.  Their entry was very clean.  Both of their...  We are the weirdest people.  And I mean like Americans in general, because all of a sudden we get into this Olympics shit,  and then two weeks from now, we're not going to give a fuck about water polo, synchronized...  None of this.  We'll never even care about these names ever again.  I like how some of these lower networks, though, they try to tail on to the end of the Olympics 
[00:06:00]  by showing like diving.  Right.  Like, out of nowhere, they'll have, you know, hey, it's diving.  Right.  And you'd be like, well, the Olympics are over.  Oh, look, this is on like ESPN 8.  Yeah, exactly.  No, you don't understand.  It's the world championships.  Who cares?  Yeah, exactly.  Who cares about that?  Look at these fucking idiots.  Are these actual videos from these...  From the Olympics.  From these Olympics?  Yeah.  Try to find the American team.  Not much of a splash.  Good...  No. 
[00:06:30]  Good entry.  I don't know.  I would never wear anything like that.  They're all in the little jacuzzi now, and they're just hanging out.  What the fuck?  It's a bathhouse, and then they dive every once in a while?  It's Play-Doh's retreat.  What the fuck?  Little bathhouse hijinks.  I don't get it.  Is this the American team?  You'll know in a second, when they move toward the platform.  Oh, man.  Look at this guy.  It's just fucking...  It's Club Soda Kenny's nose.  And his pants.  Oh, then they count one, two, three, four. 
[00:07:00]  Sam, are you in?  Yeah, totally.  That's pretty good.  How funny is that?  It was.  It's just a big fist sticking right out of his crotch.  Yeah, he's got something in there.  And there's some shame involved, because he's like, I know I have to dive now, but I also  know I've got to kind of cover up my huge fucking dick.  Huge turgid cock.  Look, and you can see where they're going down.  The other guy's like, I don't have that problem.  The other guy's able to strap it down in the tiny little fucking bikini bottoms.  The other guy's like, what do you mean? 
[00:07:30]  It's pretty goddamn cool.  Oh, what's up with that camera?  You were talking about that.  Oh, that fucking camera that follows him down, and then it goes underwater.  You think it's a...  And then they go into the jacuzzi.  And it gets all warm and bigger.  Oh, yeah.  And look, and they all got fucking their hineys sticking out.  I think that camera goes into a tube in the water.  That makes sense.  That's my guess.  It goes down, follows him down in the air, but then it enters the water so flawlessly,  no bubbles, no splash, and it must go into a glass tube or something. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Looks cool.  They got some great views.  See...  When you think about...  See, the rest of the divers from this side angle, you see nothing going on.  That guy's got a fat cock.  They're pretty much flied, but the one American.  Yeah.  We're the ladies.  You should have been pointing this out.  Not us.  Yeah.  Fuck.  America wins again.  You were laughing, Sam.  It's so noticeable, right?  Oh, my God.  It's just...  If I was that guy, I would beg for a bigger fucking bathing suit.  Oh, good entry.  I wouldn't. 
[00:08:30]  No, you would just...  I would want to show off in front of the world.  You would wear it proud?  Yeah.  And how the fuck do these guys, as much as we're making fun of this, how the fuck are  they not hitting their heads constantly on that cement platform?  They do come very close, don't they?  And they have to get really close to have a proper dive, so...  Yeah.  Fuck that.  Oh, back into the jacuzzi.  Why don't you join me?  Oh, you see how he playfully jumped in.  Very playful.  Right next to his partner.  Oh, we did our dive.  It's time for another dip in the jacuzzi.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's their little reward for doing a good dive. 
[00:09:00]  This Olympic event is 20 seconds long, and then it's back into the jacuzzi with the  fellas.  And then it's just gayness.  Oh, wow.  That was a good one.  Was that a good splash?  That was very good.  Very synchronized.  That's the end of their Olympics.  It's time to get back into the jacuzzi.  Right.  Oh, let's run into the jacuzzi together now with our little bikinis.  Let's touch each other.  Yeah, they do some hugging first.  There's a lot of, like, genital bumping in the Olympics.  Oh, my God. 
[00:09:30]  Between the volleyball and the...  A lot of it.  And the fucking diving guys.  I noticed volleyball...  I like that beach volleyball, the Czech team.  Yeah, but I...  They got some girl on the Czech team that was very attractive.  I tweeted last night.  I'm like, you know, this stupid fucking London weather...  It is ruining it.  It's kind of a little colder.  There's always a little rain in the air.  Yeah.  And the women played yesterday and jumped...  And sweats, basically.  Yeah.  So I went, why bother?  I don't give a fuck who wins. 
[00:10:00]  I want to see, you know, girls jumping up and down in bikinis.  Yeah, it was a drag.  They, uh...  They were...  Couldn't get dressed.  Right.  It's not the finals.  I would watch the women's volleyball finals for the gold medal in sweatsuits.  Absolutely.  But these preliminaries where it doesn't matter, you're actually tuning in because you want  to see some hot bodies in bikinis.  See some bikini clad.  Yeah, the Czech team looked good.  And then there was some Argentinian...  It might have been on the regular volleyball, you know, that indoor fucking volleyball. 
[00:10:30]  Uh...  She had big tits.  We were talking about big tits in the Olympics?  Yeah.  She had big tits.  This Argentinian.  I didn't see her.  Yeah.  I saw the Paraguay, uh, broad.  Paraguay.  And then the Brazilians, no matter what they're doing, they just got fucking nice asses.  The Paraguay broad is by far the hottest girl in the Olympics.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's been in the, you know, the Sports Illustrated swimsuit and all that.  Paraguay.  Can you find the Paraguay, uh, girl?  Please.  And I want to see the one Anne's talking about.  And then I was watching the, um, of course, the, uh, water polo. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, God.  The women's water polo again.  And they were playing hungry, and holy shit, are those some unattractive girls, those Hungarians.  It's funny we were playing hungry, because one of our broads doesn't look like she's that hungry.  Doesn't look like she goes hungry much.  Nope.  What a fucking...  Holy...  You see the dumper on her?  She is huge.  There was a picture going around yesterday, I guess it's one of ours.  She came out of the pool with a massive wedgie in her fat fucking ass.  Big wedgie in her big ass. 
[00:11:30]  She's an iceberg.  She's huge.  Above the water with just her head popping out and a ball in her hand, she looks all right.  But man, she got out of that pool.  It's like, wow, what's going on down below?  See, I don't know much about water polo.  Maybe she's like the goon in hockey.  Oh, really?  Maybe she's a goon.  Yeah, they do try to drown each other.  That's kind of cool about the sport.  Yeah, they fucking pull each other down underwater and shit.  But it's so fucking dull.  Like, you watch hockey.  Right.  They take a shot on goal, it misses, and then they all start skating to the other goal 
[00:12:00]  because the team's got it and everything.  In this water polo, they take a shot, they throw the ball, it misses the net, and then  they all go in this long fucking slow swim to the other side of the pool, and it's like,  oh God, it's just dull.  It looks exhausting.  Yeah.  And I want to know what high school you go to to play half these sports to find out  that you can even be good at it.  I think there are these rich fucking...  My high school, baseball, basketball, football, track, and I think you could throw soccer in 
[00:12:30]  there, and that pretty much was all you could choose from.  That's pretty much it, yeah.  Some of these high schools, you could actually get on a water polo team?  I guess so, yeah, the ones with the indoor pools.  I guess you're talking a pretty rich fucking school district.  Or how do you do swimming?  Right.  Barber Fields High School was not a bad high school.  We didn't have swimming, or did we?  No, I don't think we did.  That's probably why you don't see a lot of minorities in the water sports.  Well.  Well.  Well.  Yeah.  Well, right. 
[00:13:00]  I did tweet about the Kenyans.  Yes, yes.  I said that the Kenyans got kicked out of water polo because they were using swimmies.  Oh, the swimmies.  Whoops.  Whoops.  Well.  See.  You know.  Everyone wants to tweet the obvious.  You really don't see a lot of blacks in the pool.  Yeah.  I don't know what that's.  Do you think that's because they're poor?  Well, yeah.  I don't see a lot of.  Or do you think it's because of the stereotype?  I don't see a lot of water polo nets up in those community pools in Brooklyn. 
[00:13:30]  No.  You know?  No.  I see a lot of cross-checking, but not a lot of nets and funny hats.  You know, the definition of Butterface is women's volleyball, by the way.  Yes.  These broads, these women, these ladies.  Let's keep it nice today.  These women, these ladies, these bodies are ridiculous.  And then their faces suck.  It is hard to get a Revlon sponsorship out of these. 
[00:14:00]  They're tall and slender.  And then you get to the face, and there's just shit going on.  There's the Paraguay girl.  You got her.  Oh, let me say.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Damn.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Is she going to medal in anything?  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Holy crap.  She's the hottest girl in the Olympics.  I challenge you to find someone hotter.  Look at the one on the left.  Oh, I've seen some hotties.  You don't think this girl's hot?  Too ethnic for you?  She's a little ethnic right there.  She looks good in that other picture right there.  That's nice ethnic, though.  She looks like she should be wearing a bolo hat, walking around cocaine fields. 
[00:14:30]  Come on.  It's not that bad.  Look at that.  Yeah, she's got a hot fucking body on her.  Come on.  Come on now.  Oh, and our volleyball team has the fried eggs for boobs.  Oh, I know.  What the fuck?  Yeah, they got them fucking flat, saggy tits.  I don't know what's going on there.  How do you get saggy A-cups?  It's sad.  It is.  It's just sad.  Just sad.  They're not wearing bras. 
[00:15:00]  I don't know.  Federica.  All right.  We got some people.  Bimmel?  I don't know.  Jeff in Austin.  What's up, Jeff?  Hey, man.  Hey.  I don't know which chick you're talking about, so she's probably hot.  But this one's an Italian swimmer.  Her name is Federica Pellegrini.  Pellegrini?  Pellegrini.  She's smoking hot, man.  Yeah, like the water, I guess.  She's smoking hot, bro.  Yeah.  Check her out.  All right.  We'll check her out.  So you think this girl's... 
[00:15:30]  You think she's hotter than Paraguay?  You're crazy.  All right.  That's why I said...  She don't look bad.  She's all right, though.  Don't get me wrong, but I think Paraguay's hotter than her.  It's weird, because they got a lot of muscles, these girls.  They got a lot of muscles.  So it kind of weirds out their body a little bit.  Right.  A little.  Oh, look at this.  Come on.  Her arms are bigger than mine.  Yeah.  Hey, okay.  Well, check it out.  When you see her pictures, when she's not done up in her swimsuit, she's got one where 
[00:16:00]  she's laying back and she's topless, but she's got her arms covering her nipples.  Arm bra.  Yeah.  One of the nipples is peeking out behind her arm there.  Use the proper terminology.  It's called a hand bra.  All right.  All right.  Later.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Not bad.  Not bad.  Not bad.  I'm still going with Paraguay myself.  What, she got a tramp stamp?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  That's a low tramp stamp.  Whoa.  Goes right from her ass crack.  Why do all the swimmers have to drink the pool water before swimming?  Yeah, what is that?  Do they really? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Is that some kind of tradition?  I've seen that shit.  Isn't that chlorine in that motherfucker?  Entire field hockey team from Denmark, very hot.  Yeah, I've been seeing that picture.  That picture's been going around.  Check out the pubes on the U.S. women's water polo flat soak.  Google U.S. women's.  You ready, Sam?  Mm-hmm.  This is J.D.  He's definitely trustworthy.  Google U.S. women's water polo team pubic hair third choice.  Come on.  Nice.  You didn't put third choice in. 
[00:17:00]  No, no.  Wait.  You put it.  Oh, third choice.  U.S. women's water polo team pubic hair?  Yeah.  Our third choice is a bunch of dude's asses.  Why are they dudes?  Look at the fourth picture.  What the fuck?  Oh, God.  What the fuck is going on?  That's not water polo.  This guy's got gay fucking pics coming up.  He's clean, though.  Come on.  Did you put women's?  Oh, yeah.  U.S. without the dot dots, maybe.  And women's without the pub.  No, yeah.  Try that.  Try that. 
[00:17:30]  Try that first.  Try that.  That's a beard.  That's not really good.  All right.  Go with the women's again.  J.D., you fucked up.  Yeah, you suck.  I can't trust J.D. anymore.  Ah, you stink.  I can't trust J.D. anymore.  What the fuck, J.D.?  You're full of shit, you asshole.  All right.  I got the website.  You ready?  The website?  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's start with forums.  Okay.  Forums.  undergroundhiphop.com  slash readpost.asp 
[00:18:00]  question mark  forum  equals  gen discussions  How do you spell gen?  G-E-N  All right.  I want to see if this works.  That N thing, but it's all loopy.  Ampersand?  Yeah, I don't know.  Which page?  Which page?  Which.  Oh, man.  Equals one.  Oh, no.  What is that about the equals one thing?  I don't know.  Then the N thing again.  Ampersand?  Oh, man.  Question. 
[00:18:30]  Question mark?  Mr. Mark.  No, you have to spell out question.  Question.  Oh, Jesus.  ID.  ID with ID in caps.  This will never, ever work.  Equals.  This will never work.  Equals.  3-1-3-5.  3-1-3-5.  6-7-4.  6-7-4.  Do we have a winner?  All right.  Okay.  Now you sent us to a fucking...  Now I have to figure out if it's in general discussion or not?  You asshole.  What the hell?  But you know, it got us there, Sam.  Yeah, I know.  But this idiot... 
[00:19:00]  It just got you to a message board front page that you could have just put the address for the message board.  Yeah.  Asshole.  Well, fuck, man.  How are we going to see the pubes sticking out of the flat zone?  Yeah.  Eric said he's got a link.  Eric's got a link.  All right.  Let's see.  We all know.  All right.  Let's see this.  Eric's not exactly dependable.  No.  Oh, and the Lern Franco is really hot, too.  Yeah.  There's a beast.  Look at this beast.  What a fat lump of shit.  Look at that.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that's some shaved pussy.  Oh, God. 
[00:19:30]  She shaved it for the Olympics, but...  What a giant swimsuit.  Plus, the opening ceremonies are a couple days ago already, so...  Yeah, yeah.  We've got some growth coming in.  Some grub is growing in.  She just shaved it for the opening ceremonies, and now she's got a healthy 5 o'clock shadow.  How is it that you're part of a sport where you can't touch the bottom of the pool, and  you're that big?  You're giant.  Also, if they won, she would have an Olympic medal, and she's an athlete, and she's huge  and fat.  Did you hear about the medals? 
[00:20:00]  I'm trying to find all the...  I know they're being stored in the Tower of London.  That's true.  I like learning about...  I like that weird shit.  Instead of everything, all the stuff people are talking about on the regular shit.  One of the guys was so happy about winning a bronze medal, he wore it everywhere, including  the shower.  And I guess there's a, I don't know, like a piece of string or something, and that broke,  and the medal fell off his neck and dented it on the floor of the shower, and he's all 
[00:20:30]  bummed out.  And I was reading this article where it turns out the bronze medals are worth like $3.14.  That's it, huh?  How is that possible with all the money that is being spent on these games?  Well...  And then supposedly the gold medal is only worth $644.  $644.  If you went, here's a gold medal, and you went to pawn it, let's say.  There you go.  Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.  That ain't gonna happen.  I'll tell you what.  I'll...  I...  That's retail.  I'm talking $100 cash money right now. 
[00:21:00]  But it says $644.  Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.  No, I don't think...  You know, I wouldn't give them damn much, son.  That ain't gonna happen.  See, we're gonna...  It's gonna sit in the shop for a while, and we're gonna have to...  But $100.  I want more than $100.  It's a gold medal.  Yes.  Beloved God.  Obviously, some of these gold medals are worth a lot of money depending on who wins them,  but the basic gold medal, if you're in one of these sports that no one gives a fuck  about, and you realize 10 years from now you're desperate and need money, they're only 
[00:21:30]  worth $644, face value.  Well, I guess that just proves that all that glitters is not gold.  And then he laughs.  He laughs at his own shit all the time.  Ride him up, chum.  All right, so we got the pubic hair out of the way.  Now we move on to...  What the hell was her name again?  Yeah, learn Franco.  L-E-R-Y-N.  She might be the hottest Olympian. 
[00:22:00]  Franco.  Look at this one, man.  Franco.  Is she the Paraguay one again?  She might be the Paraguay.  Yeah.  Oh, it's the same fucking bitch.  Come on, now.  Come on, now.  I didn't know her real name.  Look at these pictures.  Come on.  Who's gonna be hotter than her, Ant?  I know you're not a big ethnic fan, but come on.  Well, I don't know.  I like snotty Michaela.  Come on.  Look at...  Are you kidding me?  You see that picture?  She is a little ethnic.  Oh, eh.  She's very, um...  Ethnic. 
[00:22:30]  Very Spanish looking.  Look at...  She looks like one of them little fucking...  Oh, my God.  All right.  Are you kidding me?  No, she's got her body smoking.  You don't like the...  What's wrong with the face?  I think her face is the best part of her.  She's got a Penelope Cruz thing going a little bit.  I think she's hotter than Penelope Cruz.  How about that?  No, she's got a kind of a...  Well, how about that nipple?  Tits hanging out.  Sticking out.  Well, she's...  A fucking tits hanging out.  She's obviously from a country where they're not all skittish about their nipples being shown.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  I think she walked down a runway like that.  She's hot.  I got no fucking problem with her.  All right.  All right.  They shocked the water to keep it so clear so they know what it tastes like when they jump in.  Wait, what?  They shocked the water to keep it so clear so they know what it tastes like when they jump in.  What does that mean?  What?  That doesn't make any sense.  Who's on the phones?  Robert.  Yeah.  It might be you or the screener.  Good luck.  Now, what are you trying to say?  You know how they...  Anthony should know. 
[00:23:30]  You know how they shocked the pools, right?  Yeah, they put a lot of chlorine.  Hey, asshole, I don't need a pool to know that you shocked the water, by the way.  I think most people know.  Yeah.  You can shock your pool water.  Okay, but to keep the water so clear so the cameras can see in there, they put...  I mean, it's a lot of chlorine.  Okay.  A lot of shit in that pool.  So when them guys go in, when they're swimming, they go ahead and just chug it a little bit and they'll spit it back out.  Why are they spitting out the water, though?  That doesn't answer our question.  Yeah, why are they drinking it all? 
[00:24:00]  Because it's a bad taste.  I mean, it's so much chemical in there, it's a shock to their taste, but if they're going to throw up, they're going to throw up outside the pool, not in the pool.  So why are they drinking it?  All right, it's not the screener, by the way.  I made my decision.  Although maybe the screener should not have let this guy do it at all.  What are you talking about?  Why would they fucking put it in their mouths in the first place?  You do realize most people don't actually drink pool water ever.  Oh, you jackass.  Listen.  Where are the jackasses?  Jesus.  When you jump in the pool and they're swimming, when they're taking that breath, they get a lot of water in their mouths. 
[00:24:30]  You understand that, right?  Well, he don't need to swim.  I've seen people just drink the water.  What do you mean?  In the pool.  Why would they drink the water?  I don't know.  Okay.  You see them get out of the pool and they go into them showers?  That's what they're doing.  They're washing all that stuff off of them.  It's a lot of chemicals.  Oh.  How many grades were you left behind in school?  I need to know. 
[00:25:00]  How many years did it take to complete one through 12?  How many years did it take?  Dude, I graduated.  Oh?  I graduated.  He's a high school graduate.  That answers my question.  He's giving us basic pool knowledge.  You've got to put chlorine in it.  It's hard.  Yeah.  It's not shocking.  It's a lot of chlorine.  And we all understand that sometimes the chlorine will dry out your skin and it feels a little uncomfortable,  so you will take a shower to wipe it off. 
[00:25:30]  The water doesn't taste good.  And the water doesn't taste good.  We all know that.  So they throw up in the pool?  No, they throw up outside the pool.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  So that way they throw up more.  See, because everyone knows everyone throws up from drinking pool water.  It's the Olympics.  We have to throw up.  Right.  And they've got to keep the water clear for the cameras.  Right.  Which makes sense.  And that's why they taste the water.  Right.  They can't throw up in it.  But they usually drink the water, but because they're keeping it clear for the cameras,  it's too much chlorine that they're realizing, oh, fuck, I can't drink this pool water. 
[00:26:00]  I've got to spit it out.  I'm a graduate.  And then I'm going to fucking puke later anyway because of the bad taste in my mouth.  We got it, Robert.  Or they jump in and go, oh, this probably tastes horrible.  Yeah.  Let me have a taste.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me have a taste of that.  I got another one for you.  I got another one for you.  Oh.  The guys that sit behind, that sit there.  Yeah.  Do you notice all of them looking at the guys' asses, the divers' asses, before they do the relays?  Do you notice that? 
[00:26:30]  What else?  They're judging the fucking race.  So it may look like they're staring at asses, but I think they're making sure they're, you  know, they're not jumping the gun and they're making sure they're ready to go.  All right.  All right.  All right, Robert.  Thank you, sir.  Hey.  Hey.  Your mom's back.  All right.  Oh, boy.  I mean, your mom's, he didn't even know what that, he has to say that after a phone call. 
[00:27:00]  He's an idiot.  All right.  What do we got here?  Well.  Well.  What's going on on Fox News?  Hubba hubba.  Yeah, why are these girls in bikinis?  I don't know.  One girl's in a bikini, one girl's in a one piece, and then one girl's in a big bag.  Hey, coffee.  There you go.  All right.  So it starts off at noon until six today at Union Square.  You know what else?  Wow.  Wow.  Cocksucking.  Union Square today in New York City.  That's crazy.  Nice.  Let's say hi to Bill in Rhode Island.  Bill.  Hello, Bill. 
[00:27:30]  How's it going, guys?  All right.  So the guy you had on before, he just didn't sound too bright about the whole pool thing.  Yeah.  It happens.  So I swam all through high school and part of college, but it's basically just a mental  thing.  You know, they get up to the blocks, they're splashing themselves in the water, just getting  psyched up, and then they just either drink some of the pool water or whatever and just  getting ready for the race.  All right.  I guess it's some kind of tradition that Mark Spitz started a long time ago.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I'm going to go with. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  By the way, I'm learning something, if this is true.  They don't use chlorine, Anthony.  What?  Saltwater pool.  That's what mine is.  I have a saltwater pool.  You have a saltwater pool?  Yeah.  Does it taste like you're in the ocean?  No.  How the fuck does that happen?  Well, first of all, it's kind of salty, but what happens is there's kind of an electronic  thing that goes on and takes the salt, and salt is N-A-C-L, sodium chloride, and it kind  of separates, and the C-L goes in the water, and that's what kind of keeps it clear, but 
[00:28:30]  it does have this slight salty taste to it.  Really?  Well, bromine, not electrical charge.  Whatever it is, I see some fucking thing there.  Don't worry about it.  I don't have to know how it works.  Is that for rich people?  Well, why does everyone else have chlorine, and what's the difference?  Is there a big difference?  It's not as crazy chlorine-y on your eyes.  It doesn't burn your eyes and everything.  It doesn't fucking bleach out your clothes or turn your hair green if you're blonde. 
[00:29:00]  It's just better.  It's cleaner.  What about the algae?  Keeps it from growing?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It keeps it.  My pool is fucking crystal clear the whole season.  It's great.  You know, you mentioned...  It doesn't get cloudy, either.  You mentioned the green hair?  Yeah.  Can't mention her name, because she's a very cool broad.  But someone I went to high school with was pretty damn hot.  Yeah, yeah.  And she was just one of those bleached blondes, and she went through school with green hair. 
[00:29:30]  Green hair.  Way before girls were dyeing their hair, by the way.  The broads...  So if a girl had a different color in their hair, it was very noticeable, and everyone  pointed behind her back.  And everyone knows chlorine green, and not like you dyed your hair green to be kind of cool.  And she was known as the girl with the green hair.  Oh, boy.  Because of her pool.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  It was sad.  Wow.  Come on, man.  Look at this.  Every picture of her is good. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  It's a little exotic for me.  What's wrong with you?  It's just a little too exotic for me.  She's very hot.  What's wrong with exotic?  I am a complete xenophobe.  I just like fucking, you know, white trash American girls.  What about a little variety pack?  No.  You're not a variety pack guy, huh?  I'm not totally a variety guy.  I really do enjoy white chicks.  How about we try this one, Sam Roberts?  There's one more hot chick.  Sam Roberts.  Put that in.  Let's see.  Sam Roberts.  This hot chick comes up.  Oh, I thought you meant C. 
[00:30:30]  Hello, gorgeous.  What an asshole.  Yeah, you really are.  Oh, that guy was right yesterday.  They called your show.  No, he wasn't.  Oh.  I was.  Come on, man.  The longer that went on, the funnier it got.  That guy's just trashing you.  I don't know.  You're trashing him.  I wasn't listening yesterday.  Oh, the after show.  It was great.  I have to listen because I got a long drive home.  You don't.  There's so many channels.  That was the lesson.  Man, what am I going to listen to?  Lithium.  Fucking.  Shade 45.  Shade. 
[00:31:00]  Fucking 1010 Winds.  Again, I know what the traffic is.  Where's this chick?  There's another one that's really hot, supposedly.  Alex Morgan.  Come on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Little Alex.  She's one of the soccer bras.  Hold on a minute.  I might go to the phones.  Oh, here.  Oh, it was on the phones.  Okay, go to...  I like a Romanian gymnast.  I like a Russian gymnast.  And I like one of the American gymnasts.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's try Allison.  Ooh. 
[00:31:30]  Allison.  Stoke.  S-T-O-K-K-E.  Come on.  Okay.  All right.  Well, she's...  All right.  Okay.  Hey, now.  Look at that.  All right.  We got some comments.  That's kind of a regular...  You pick the worst picture.  Sam will always pick...  Why do you pick the worst picture always?  The worst picture of girls.  And you have to take your beating, because it's the truth on this one.  It's always true.  This one's worse.  No.  Why would you pick the worst kind of...  She's kind of cute there.  Start with number one. 
[00:32:00]  Okay.  Start with that.  Filsome looking.  There's usually a reason why the first picture...  All right.  Look, that's way better.  Oh, man, dude.  You are a homo.  There's a big pole blocking her.  No.  What do you see when you pick pictures of hot girls?  No.  Poles.  Nice try, Sam.  What do you see when you have to pick a picture in Google Images?  Yes.  One without a pole.  Oh, come on.  Here's one of her ass.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you show the...  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  All right. 
[00:32:30]  This chick is really hot.  Holy shit.  She's in the Olympics?  Yeah.  What is she?  Hold on.  Let me go to Dave.  She's a pole vaulter.  Dave's got to get credit today.  In every picture.  Everyone needs credit these days for some reason.  Dave in Philly.  Credit.  What's up, Dave?  Hi.  Hey.  Hi.  I don't know if this girl's in the Olympics,  but she's hotter than...  She's in the Olympics?  You're cheap.  I don't know if she's in the Olympics.  She's just a hot athlete.  She's better than Loren Franco, though,  but she's fucking hot, too.  So she might not be in the Olympics.  She's comparable to the Paraguay.  She's fucking smoking.  She really is smoking.  I like that.  But now we have to find out if she's in the Olympics 
[00:33:00]  because I'm going to be watching women...  I'm going to watch women's pole vaulting now.  Wow.  Let's pretend she's in the Olympics.  Well, we can pretend.  Nothing wrong with pretending.  Is that her in her little bra?  In a bra?  No.  Wow.  That's fucking scaring me there.  Is that her?  All right.  We're going to find out if she's in the Olympics.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Dave in Philly.  Wow.  So we've covered a lot so far with the Olympics.  No, I don't think that's true.  And then what?  They went with that swimming thing?  Swimming gets fucking boring after a while.  It really does.  I know. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  But we had Missy.  What's her name there?  Missy Franklin.  Franklin.  She's 17, and she's got a gold medal,  so congratulations to her.  Yes, she got a gold.  And boy, she had to swim 10 minutes after qualifying for another event.  Yeah, why do they do that?  I don't know, but they did.  These swimmers came to the table.  Oh, wait.  She won after she had the preliminary race.  10 minutes later, she had the gold medal race.  That's fucked up.  But she definitely took it easy on the preliminary just enough to get in. 
[00:34:00]  Right.  To qualify.  She didn't go balls out.  I guess the swimmers are used to that shit.  But that doesn't seem fair to these athletes that have been working their whole lives for that moment.  If she wants to be greedy and try to get a bunch of gold, that's her fucking problem.  They should spread them out.  And why does the diving all have to be done in 48 hours?  I mean, the swimming.  Yeah.  How about they just spread it out throughout the whole Olympics?  They like to get these events done.  Yeah.  And then move on.  And then all of a sudden it'll be like, all right, time for track and field.  Why aren't they doing track and field now and some swimming now? 
[00:34:30]  I don't know.  A little variety for everybody.  I guess they don't want people running all over the joint.  Is that what it is?  Maybe.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  You hear about the Chinese swimmer?  The female swimmer?  What happened?  Period in the water?  Period in the water.  Jesus.  She swam a faster lap than Lochte.  Oh, than the men, right?  Lochte, who's supposedly the best at it.  Yeah.  And they're all like, basically everyone's saying, she's so fucked, they're going to find  something in her system. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, really?  I guess she won the gold and now they test the athletes after the fact?  Yeah, yeah.  They're saying it's impossible that this Chinese swimmer...  What's the story, Sam?  Um, I'm not going to write now.  She's 16 years old.  What's her name?  Um...  Lee Schwung.  Ah, Chang, Chang, Chang.  Ah, Wong, Chang.  Okay, whatever.  And then she broke the world record by a full second.  Right.  Which is a lot.  Well, that is a lot.  But they're saying, you know...  But what about the part about Lochte? 
[00:35:30]  Is that how you say his name?  Yeah, he was the world record holder from like a couple days ago.  Right.  And then she technically beat his time by a second.  Hmm.  But they're saying that, you know, they...  They don't want to accuse her of doping yet, but they definitely want to do a couple little  tests.  If it's not...  We should test E-Rock for doping.  I think.  Right?  Shouldn't we?  For frosting.  Oh, E-Rock.  A little self-deprecating humor.  A little self-deprecating humor. 
[00:36:00]  I know.  That just makes us feel sad.  Look, if she wasn't doping, then...  A little frosting.  If she wasn't doping, then the Chinese are doing some shit.  Yeah.  You heard it here first.  It's all secretive over there.  There's something going on if she wasn't doping.  I bet she's taking some herbs and shark cartilage.  Or is that the Japanese?  I don't know.  I mixed them up last night, too, when they...  Oh, really?  When the fucking Japanese coach went over there to pay off the judges after that debacle  they had.  What was it?  What happened?  What did I miss?  Well...  I went to bed early.  There was the men, the gymnasts, right? 
[00:36:30]  And I guess Great Britain and the Japanese and then the...  Was it the Romanian team?  I don't know.  I believe they had a problem with the judges not counting a dismount properly for the Japanese  team.  So the Japanese decided to go with an inquiry.  But in order to do an inquiry, you have to pay a fee. 
[00:37:00]  Right on the spot.  Now, it seems odd.  What?  Dude, no shit.  See, this is shit I love.  I didn't know this.  You have to pay the fee right then and there.  So the judge, the coach walks up to the judges with a bunch of, like, hundreds in his hand  and a sheet of paper and hands it over to them.  No, that seems fucked up.  I swear it was the most fucked up thing I saw.  I'm like, what are they doing?  They're, like, paying them off.  Because if someone gives me money to judge something, guess what?  Right.  I'm not going to be too fair anymore. 
[00:37:30]  It's going to be a little more.  It was the weirdest thing.  I've never seen that before.  It was very odd.  I'm like, why are they paying me?  Like, can't this go on someone's credit card?  Or maybe you could pay them later?  I think enough people are watching that you're going to keep tabs.  Right.  You could bill them?  Yeah.  Bill me later.  But no, you've got to walk up there immediately, hand them cash money, American dollars.  No.  Yes.  See, I'm Benjamin Franklin.  No, this is crazy talk.  Swear.  Saw it last night.  It was amazing.  What's the ruling on that?  I don't know.  But then they went into the Japanese favor. 
[00:38:00]  Right.  They overturned it.  And you thought it was the Chinese?  I think it's Romanian, right?  Was it one of those Eastern Bloc countries?  Yeah, yeah.  They all of a sudden were told, hey, by the way, you're bronze?  No, you don't have it.  You're fucked.  You get nothing.  If Japan didn't do that, they wouldn't have meddled at all.  But since they did that, they got the silver.  So it was a matter of getting a medal or not.  Yeah.  So they paid for their medal?  They paid for whatever that...  Really?  The instant replay or whatever it is.  The appeal.  The appeal.  They paid for the appeal and they won it. 
[00:38:30]  That sounds like it's pretty fucked up.  Well, the Armenians should have gone over there with like twice the money and said, hey,  I appeal that appeal.  Right.  And then everyone's just throwing cash at the judges and they make up their own mind.  But you confuse the Chinese and the Japanese?  Yeah.  I said, oh, the Chinese team did that and everyone's like, Japanese.  Like, shut up.  I can help you out.  Look at these, dirty knees.  But I can help you out.  The Japanese do shit with their hair.  What?  That's all they need to know.  Do they? 
[00:39:00]  They do shit with their hair.  They grow it out a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  They like perming it.  They do all sorts of shit.  Coloring it.  That's the difference between the Chinese and the Japanese.  And Chinese always go with the Moe Howard.  Always the Moe or the Pete Rose.  Chinese in general don't do anything with their hair.  Right.  That's all you need to know.  Japanese will try some shit.  They'll try to look like the Beatles and stuff.  Right.  Yeah, they always look like, I die here blonde and get the perm and spiky top.  That's all you need to know.  That's how I figure it out. 
[00:39:30]  Okay, that's a good.  You'll see that I'm right.  Well, look, Opie's Guide to Asia.  Well, it's the truth.  That makes perfect sense.  I'll have to remember that.  It's the truth.  But they do as simple as this.  They do shit with their hair.  Mm-hmm.  I'm going to tweet that.  Yeah.  Might as well.  Help out the world.  See, look.  There it is.  Look, he's got cash in his hand.  Wow, that is so weird.  And he's...  All right, I got the audio.  I want to see this.  Yeah.  That is American cash, too.  Wow.  This is...  And they're all laughing. 
[00:40:00]  The judges are laughing, like, oh.  Yeah.  Doing what's called a formal inquiry.  Why do you have cash in his hand?  That lets a little suspect, right?  But actually, they...  Keep it fair, Judge.  All right?  Keep it fair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is weird.  They're actually handing over cash.  I've never seen this before.  And if you win your inquiry, you get your cash back.  Right.  If you lose the inquiry, they keep the cash. 
[00:40:30]  How much cash?  I don't know.  There were a few hundies in there.  He's handing over some...  Ben Frankrins.  I hand you five Ben Frankrins.  That's so what?  People don't do it all the time?  I guess so, yeah.  See?  That's got to be Japanese right there.  Yep.  And you're right.  He's doing shit with his hair.  He's doing the spiky front.  The kajagugu.  The kajagugu.  Yeah.  There's many different styles they go with.  Oh, it certainly is.  Wow.  I did not know that happened.  Isn't it fucking amazing?  They just hand on some cake. 
[00:41:00]  Anyone know about Olympic competition and can tell us what that's about?  Well, we kind of do know.  They have to hand it over immediately.  And I think it is so.  It limits the amount of times some team would do that.  How about the judges?  It's just final.  They're there to judge and that's it.  That is a little weird that they don't do a final judgment.  But maybe have a super judge that goes, you know what?  You're judging well, but I saw something.  So let's take another look.  And then they decide on their own that they should maybe take another look. 
[00:41:30]  Yes.  I don't know.  The money thing looks really bad.  It does look bad.  They pay the money.  So if it goes in your favor, you get the money back.  But if it doesn't, it's sort of like a penalty for wasting their time.  Yeah.  Well, you sort of said that.  How much money is it?  It was definitely at least a couple of hundred.  That's it?  I don't know.  It might have been a few hundred.  Looked more than one.  Less than five. 
[00:42:00]  Maybe.  Not several.  Several.  A few, maybe.  Several hundred?  No.  A few hundred.  A few hundred.  More than a couple.  Pretty plus more on Twitter.  I'm suspicious, though, because her avatar is just her back.  So I don't know why pretty plus more.  You would think if your Twitter handle was pretty plus more, you would show a little more than just your back.  Right.  As you're sitting on the beach in a bikini.  Exactly.  Korea had to wire money for the appeal after Fencer got screwed. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, yeah?  They had to wire for money.  I heard something about the fencing, but that's another sport I don't care about.  It's so stupid.  It's wacky sword fighting.  They're just poking each other.  They're poke, poke, poke, and then they're connected with a cable or some shit.  I don't know.  It's kind of odd.  And you would assume the Hispanics would be really good at that poking shit.  Yeah?  Yeah, with their knife play.  Oh, their knife play?  Something like that?  See, that's pretty plus more.  Mm-hmm.  She's just showing the back.  Boy, are you a critical little man there, Sam, aren't you? 
[00:43:00]  That little fucking mouse, yeah, the little arrow sure can point out things.  Plus more?  You're looking at plus more?  Oh, she's nice enough.  I know.  All right.  Should we break?  Yeah, let's eat some grub.  We're going to play the Olympic beep game next.  Oh.  Can't wait for that.  Fun, fun.  And I think we covered all the Olympics. 
[00:43:30]  The gymnastics were good?  Men's gymnastics?  Uh, no, you know.  It's probably that pummel horse.  Donk-a-donk-a-donk.  Donk-a-donk-a-donk.  Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo.  Donk-a-donk-a-donk-a-donk.  Donk-a-donk-a-donk.  It's spinning around on their hands.  Looks very difficult.  You ever do gymnastics in school?  Never.  We did.  We had to, I think.  Really?  Yeah, basic shit.  I did pot smoking out back.  Nice.  That was my, uh, sport in, in school.  Basic shit.  I don't even know what I could do.  I'm trying to remember, even. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, I like to do an iron cross on the rings.  Oh, hell no.  The iron cross.  Fuck no, man.  How are they not dislocating their shoulders?  I've never done anything where I needed to do the pike position.  Never.  Never, ever.  And I don't feel like I ever will.  We're going to do the Olympic beat game, and I got this.  Two Olympic events that men are not allowed to do.  And for some reason, they want to do this.  There's a little controversy. 
[00:44:30]  Do you have the answer?  No.  Two events.  This is a boggle.  That men are not allowed to do.  Men are not allowed to do.  Or they certainly are not doing at this time, I should say.  Strictly a female event.  Mm-hmm.  That ribbon thing?  Yes.  But what guys, like, I want to be able to do the ribbon thing?  Yeah.  Hey!  Well, obviously.  Obviously.  The ribbon thing's one of them.  I don't even know what the event is. 
[00:45:00]  But yes, the ribbon thing.  The ribbon thing.  And, um...  Are men doing synchronized swimming?  Wow, you nailed it.  Did you fucking have help?  No, I swear.  No help?  Swear, I would tell you.  You just nailed the two events.  That's it.  Because they're two of the fruitiest events.  And, of course, the famous SNL bit.  Yeah, of course.  With Harry Shearer and, um...  Who else?  Marty.  Yeah, Marty.  His friends like to call him Marty.  Marty.  We get it.  You know him a little better than we do.  Shut up.  Martian.  It's Martin. 
[00:45:30]  Marty Short.  Marty.  Yes, the famous...  That's when, like...  ...synchronized swimming bit.  Because it's so ridiculous to think of men doing that,  that's why I thought it was probably synchronized swimming.  Right.  And the ribbon thing, yeah.  What guy's going to run around trailing a ribbon on a stick?  Is that all you do?  Flittering it around.  Well, they do gymnastic things.  What about the throw the ball up in the air gymnastics?  Do they do that one?  I think that's part of the same event.  Is it?  I think they use a ball, a ribbon, and, like...  But I think I've seen men do the ball-y thing.  I don't know.  Now I'm confused. 
[00:46:00]  Do men do the ball-y thing?  Oh, God.  Maybe I read it wrong.  Is there more events?  I think the men might do the ball thing.  What's the ball thing?  Is that different than the ribbon thing?  They're doing, like, the floor thing, the floor routine.  Right.  But then they throw a ball up in the air.  Now they roll.  They come up and catch the ball.  Well, now, why is that an event?  But they got rid of baseball, softball.  A lot of people pissed off they got rid of baseball and softball.  That seems, like, dumb. 
[00:46:30]  And I don't think they have golf anymore.  Golf is a dumb Olympic sport.  Why?  It just takes too long.  Over the ribbon thing?  It just takes too long.  It's a four-day tournament.  That's too long.  You put everyone in there, and that's it.  Olympic sports should be, like, fast.  You think?  Like diving.  You like diving.  Synchronized diving is better than golf?  You work four years for one fucking second.  All sports should be limited to 25 seconds.  And who was the big-breasted woman that you said earlier? 
[00:47:00]  Argentinian.  Did we see her?  I don't think so.  What sport was she doing?  I think it was regular, like, indoor volleyball.  Really?  Yeah.  And you know they strapped them down, so they got to be really good.  Oh, yeah, she was running like a sportsman, but it was fucking all tit meat.  Really?  Yeah.  How do we find her, Sam?  Yeah, Sam.  Do we find a link to her?  Find her.  What's her name?  Anybody there on Peltalk?  She was playing yesterday, I think.  Maybe.  Regular volleyball.  Anything. 
[00:47:30]  Regular volleyball.  Argentina.  Big tits.  Tall.  Is there something called five-on-five fencing?  Bikes in the face.  That can't be possible.  No, it's not Bill Tetley.  It's not volleyball, volleyball person.  It's not...  Wow, but if you Google...  It's not Tits McGillicuddy.  But if you Google him, it's big-breasted volleyball.  It's not Mimi Beardsley.  It's not Mimi?  No.  Whoa, hey.  It's not who gives a shit. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  All right.  We'll try to figure it out.  She's from Argentina.  We'll try to figure it out during the break.  Hey, that's my sister's name.  We got a new John Sterling phone call we've all been waiting for.  Phone call?  I mean, Jesus, sorry.  Home run call.  WWE manager makes a Kobe rape joke.  Yeah.  Topical.  Is that bad?  Yeah, I mean, they're trying to do a PG show.  Oh, so what?  Someone's just riffing and they fucked up?  Yeah.  Oh, boy. 
[00:48:30]  They left a live mic on them.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, exactly.  Really topical.  That's beautiful.  Linda McMahon's trying to run for office.  They're doing this now.  And then we got a creature washing up under the Brooklyn Bridge.  We get this from time to time.  What kind of creature?  Do we know yet?  Monster.  Oh, a monster.  Cloverfield?  Wow.  Like a baby Cloverfield.  Baby Cloverfield.  Nice.  Happy birthday, Mike Tyson.  I just saw that.  47.  47 years young.  Hit it.  All right, where were we? 
[00:49:00]  Where were we?  Where were we indeed?  We got the creature washing up under the Brooklyn Bridge.  Another one of these things.  Yeah.  They don't know what it is, but it turns out to be like a fucking duck.  Duck what it's fucking, how it's burnt off. 
[00:49:30]  All right, let's find out what it is.  Fuck it.  All right.  Why waste time?  Let's get right into this.  Some creature washing up under the Brooklyn Bridge here in New York City.  Hmm.  This grotesque carcass washing up on the shoreline in Manhattan.  Pictures of the creature have been circulating online for days,  and we have an exclusive report from Trace Gallagher about what it might be.  Trace?  Denise Ginley was walking along the East River with her boyfriend,  this weekend, Megan, and she saw this grotesque thing, right?  It was in the sand under the Brooklyn Bridge on the Manhattan side. 
[00:50:00]  Listen to her.  At first I thought it was like some sort of horrible,  like bloated carcass of a dead dog that had fallen in the river,  but then as we got closer, it was like those weren't really dog paws.  So we decided to climb over the fence, which took some courage,  and get a little closer to it to take better pictures.  What do you think it is?  We're looking at this right now.  That's some kind of fucking pig or something.  What would he go with?  It does have a piggy look, but it is bloated, 
[00:50:30]  and you can't really tell the fur is off of it.  When that shit gets bloated, it fucks it up, right?  Yeah.  Hmm.  I wonder if we're going to find the answer.  What are they saying?  I don't know.  I don't know what they're saying.  They're saying monster.  They're saying monster?  Okay.  I'll go with monster.  All right.  We got a monster.  It's a monster.  A monster.  Monsters are just creatures that we haven't discovered yet, right?  That's it.  Okay.  I'm sure there was a time when, like, I don't know,  the giraffe was considered a monster.  A monster.  How about giant crocodiles?  I bet you that was a monster. 
[00:51:00]  Crocodile.  Leon.  Because if it's living on Earth, it's not a monster.  It's just something we haven't discovered,  but we've pretty much discovered most shit, right?  Yes.  But first time you saw a rhino,  you had to run back to your village and go,  holy fuck, I just saw a monster.  There's a monster out there.  It's got a big fucking horn on its face,  and it's big and armor-plated looking.  Yeah.  And you'd just be like, what?  Get out of here.  I'm trying to think.  Other weird things, creatures.  The rhino would be a good one. 
[00:51:30]  Yes.  Giraffe.  They're pictures.  And these are the pictures, right?  I mean, look at this thing.  That's amazing, right?  Here is what she says.  She had no idea what it was.  Very weird.  So weird that she wanted her boyfriend to flip it over  so she could get a better look.  The guys always get the best jobs, right?  Well, the boyfriend did do that.  Listen.  What a guy.  And we rolled it over, and it was, I mean,  I was concerned it was going to, like,  burst or something else horrible.  But it was just kind of stiff, and it, like,  at first it didn't, it didn't want to. 
[00:52:00]  This couple has got to get a hold of themselves.  They really do.  Let's relax.  I'm listening to this guy, like, what the fuck cares?  You hear how she's like, and then we climbed over the fence.  That was quite brave on our part.  Was it really brave?  Was it going to attack you?  Right.  How about you relax a little bit?  You saw something a little different.  How big is it, by the way?  Because it could just be a rat.  I don't know.  Is it big?  It doesn't say.  It's probably a fucking rat.  Like, at first it didn't, it didn't want to, like,  bend as they rolled.  It was gross.  Yeah.  Very gross.  They posted the pictures on the web,  and, of course, everybody immediately knew what it was. 
[00:52:30]  Of course, everybody immediately had 50,000 different theories  about what it was.  It was a giant rat, a small raccoon, a deformed seal.  The Parks and Rec said it's a pig from a family cookout.  Except, look at that.  Pigs don't have five fingers.  Family cookout.  Right?  Pigs don't have long claws that can be used to grab kids out of cradles in the scary movies.  I mean, just not a pig.  It's very reminiscent, though, Megan, of the Montauk monster, your favorite. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, the Montauk monster.  Last year, nobody's quite sure what it is, but give us your theory.  Chupacubra, or however you pronounce that.  Chupacubra.  Chupacubra.  Chupacubra.  Chip of radio.  Chip of TVs or something.  Getting the rap.  Apparently, they don't want to hear this discussion.  Did you hear what they did there, though?  Yeah.  They told them what it is.  And they go, well, we still don't know what it is.  No, they told you it's a pig.  It's some kind of a pig.  That's what the Parks Department wants you to believe.  Oh, wow.  They don't want us to think that there's actually monsters out there? 
[00:53:30]  Oh, my God.  Who at the Parks Department would know something like that?  Jeffrey.  Jeffrey.  Jerry's cousin, Jeffrey.  Let me tell you about what Jeffrey did.  Uncle Leo.  Grabbing his arm.  Uncle Leo.  All right.  Are you ready for the Olympic beep game?  I am ready.  What kind of Olympics we got today, by the way? 
[00:54:00]  Anything fun?  Are we actually going to...  I think we got a little more women's gymnastics today.  Am I right?  I think I'm right.  And some more swimming, perhaps?  Isn't shit going on right now?  Yeah, it's England.  Yeah, let's put on some Olympic channels, boys.  Please.  I know MSNBC might have it.  Oh, no.  They got to do their stupid Morning Joe crap.  No, they're doing their political Morning Joe Romney Bash fest.  Find us some Olympic coverage, please. 
[00:54:30]  Might not be on yet.  Oh, it's on.  What?  It's 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.  It's on.  It's fucking noon over there.  They got something going on somewhere.  It's fucking noon.  They just have Today Show live over there right now.  I know NBC is trying to...  is hoping the world doesn't realize that it's delayed.  Yeah.  God, these idiots.  With Twitter and everything else, you can't hold back the results anymore.  So figure out another way to do the Olympic coverage.  The Twitter.  Right?  How would they do it? 
[00:55:00]  Can't really show the primetime shit at noon.  No one would watch it.  You got to just show it.  Well, you just got to show it live.  And then rerun it later.  Right.  And then package it with all that Bob Costas nonsense.  That's a problem for everyone in the West Coast who wants to watch it, too, because it's  not coming on until primetime in the West Coast.  But everybody already knows what's happened because, you know, everybody considers the  East Coast to be...  Yeah.  Please.  What are you talking about, Travis?  What?  Ooh.  There's no Olympic coverage? 
[00:55:30]  Jimmy!  Little Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy had a sleep study.  Yeah.  That's how I used to study for everything.  You look all fresh.  No, not really.  I'm tired, man.  I mean, it was a...  Oh, I don't know what you guys...  It was a...  They woke me up late because I had finally fallen asleep.  Oh, right.  And they wanted to give me enough data so I didn't have to come back.  They're supposed to wake me at 515.  It woke me at quarter to seven.  Oh, man.  It was rough.  Oh.  It was rough?  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:56:00]  Get a couple sips of coffee.  Relax a little bit.  I want to hear all about the sleep study.  Yes.  I want to know what that's all about.  Jimmy's always got something going on.  I just Twittered a photo.  Did you see the photo on the way in?  No.  We're too busy doing a radio show.  Oh, crazy.  I just think of that.  Let me see.  Let me see.  You still have some cream behind your ears.  I know.  It's all over me.  They got cream?  Cream behind his ears.  All right.  All right.  We get it.  On my way to work after a comfortable night's rest.  Oh, my God.  That's how you had a look?  Yeah.  Oh, let's see.  That was before I was in there.  You look like you could be a...  Holy shit. 
[00:56:30]  ...Batman.  Yeah.  You always look like a supervillain no matter what you put on.  You could be a...  Yeah, man.  You're going out for the wrong roles.  You could be a villain.  That's really fucking...  That's creepy shit.  ...shary looking.  Yeah.  How the fuck do you sleep with all that on?  It was a split night.  The first part of the night, you're supposed to lay down and sleep with nothing on.  No mask, no nothing, because this way they hook you up.  Right.  And they know exactly what's going on with you.  Oh.  Like, they monitor your heart.  They monitor your breathing, your eyes.  I think it's a scam. 
[00:57:00]  Cock?  Because there's no one alive that could sleep that way, so then you leave the sleep study.  Yeah, you got sleep problems.  Yeah, no shit.  I'm fucking sleeping in a strange place.  Look at all the wires and stuff.  It was terrible, dude.  But then I fell asleep because I took a melatonin.  It was nine o'clock at night, I went to bed.  Wait, but why would you take anything if they're doing a sleep study?  Because you said melatonin is what your brain releases.  It's a natural thing, and it's not going to change what I do when I'm sleeping.  Okay, gotcha.  So he wakes me up at like two o'clock in the morning.  All right, we got back, Dad, and now we have to put the mask on. 
[00:57:30]  And I had brought my masks with me.  I had like 12.  Oh, you got your mask.  That's what's in the UFC bag?  Well, there's my pillow.  Oh, my God.  I have my pillow, and I have three different masks.  Such a sweet boy.  Your life's exhausting.  I know.  It really is.  But I get anxiety, so it took me a long time to sleep with the mask.  I couldn't get back to sleep, dude.  I was having panic attacks.  Of course.  Like, if someone wakes me up in the middle of the night, I'm done.  I can't go back to sleep.  Yeah, it was rough.  Unless I'm really, really tired.  Is this live Olympics? 
[00:58:00]  Oh, yeah.  All right, leave that shit on.  It's beach volleyball.  Who's playing today?  Beach volleyball.  Nice.  The sun's shining, so are they in bikinis?  Yes, they're back in their bikinis.  Yeah, motherfuckers.  Good news.  Good news for the beach volleyball fans, because that's the only reason we watch.  The sun came out.  Oh, boy.  What's that?  Oh, boy.  God, we just know, right?  We just know.  Yeah.  We just know sometimes.  We're letting Jimmy get his shit together. 
[00:58:30]  I fucking panicked when I woke up.  It's quarter to seven, but he's like, I want to do it.  You panicked, because that's not like you.  No, he told me last night, he goes, when he woke me up, he goes, you might have to come  back and do a full night with just the mask, because I wasn't sleeping.  Right.  So I think he did me a favor, actually.  So we'll see.  All right.  I have cream on me, though, and all this fucking, you can see it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why the cream?  The electrodes or whatever the fuck all that stuff is?  Yeah, where they're going to put the fucking things, they rub like a skin scraper over it, 
[00:59:00]  and they rub alcohol over it.  Ooh.  And it's like this weird place.  Like they're patching a tire tube.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  A bicycle tire tube.  Except it's a mediocre man's head.  Man, if I was in London, I would just sit and watch beach volleyball all day.  Yeah.  When they're, you know, like that.  Yeah.  Oh, she has awful tits.  Dude.  The beach volleyball chicks have awful tits.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  Their asses are nice.  But the rest of their bodies are amazing. 
[00:59:30]  And then they take off their sunglasses, and then they all look like alien and shit.  Yeah.  The sunglasses really help out, too.  But their bodies from a distance are just amazing.  Well, that was a good play.  The ball just stopped in midair.  I know.  That's a Matrix shit.  Oh.  Jinx.  See, like they pull away, and they got to go with the long shot.  The long shot is great.  You know what this reminds me of?  When you're on the Twitter, and you look at a girl's avatar on Twitter, and you're like, 
[01:00:00]  hmm.  Right.  And then you click on it, and it gets a little bigger.  Right.  And you're like, what?  And then you click on it again, and it gets full size.  Right.  And then you're like, oh, no.  See?  That's a problem.  Those, um.  Well.  All right.  Well.  Okay.  I don't even know what I'm saying.  Oh.  It's better that way.  You want to play the beep game?  Yeah.  Let's see what that's all about.  And then we get into Jim Norton's sleep study.  E-me.  That's what I told you all there is to tell.  That's it?  Yeah.  There's not much.  There's no other story to it.  Where was it?  On 62nd Street, east side. 
[01:00:30]  62nd, east side.  And you go in, and they have nice beds for you?  Yeah.  It was okay.  It was semi-comfortable.  It's like if you're in the sleep study business, you would really set it up nice.  Yeah.  Get like one of those five-star hotel beds.  It was comfortable.  And I stayed up for 30 hours just so I could sleep.  30 hours?  I did, yeah.  I was up since they said it.  It was crazy.  But then maybe they're not getting an accurate study if you stayed up so late.  Nah, because you do the same stuff.  I was gasping for breath.  It's just, ah, Jimmy.  It's terrible.  But they have a shitty mattress? 
[01:01:00]  No, no.  It's okay.  It's not amazing, but I mean, I was more than comfortable.  I slept on my back for the first time in 30 years.  Really?  But it sounds like they're a little cheap.  They should get a nice mattress.  There's a fucking urine thing down, like a plastic under it.  Oh.  I guess because a lot of apodate people tingle themselves.  So you could feel the plastic under the sheet?  I can't sleep that way.  Who could sleep that way?  Sleeping on a big diaper?  Yes, exactly.  But they had comfortable pillows and stuff.  Did you whack off? 
[01:01:30]  No.  I did yesterday afternoon before I left, but I shouldn't have because it makes my prostate  fucking swell, and I have to piss more.  I would probably...  Prostate is swell.  I probably would whack off if I'm in a sleep study.  Yeah.  Because what else are you going to do?  Is there a TV in there or anything?  Oh, yeah.  So you're watching TV before you fall asleep?  I came in.  I got in at like fucking 8.30 last night.  I was so tired.  I'm like, I just want to sleep.  And it took them a while to hook me up, and then I took the melatonin.  And by like 9.45, I was finally allowed... 
[01:02:00]  Because it took them over 20 minutes to hook me up with those fucking wires.  Eek.  Nightmare.  When do you find out?  I mean, I'm digging...  They have to give all the data to the doctor.  And then he'll let me know what they have to set my apnea mask for.  Panicking.  I kept waking up, just air blowing on me.  Thank you.  Can we see what's in your UFC bag, and then we'll move on?  Yeah.  There's not much here.  I thought...  I was hoping you would bring...  You've got to bring in all your apnea masks.  That would be fun.  I have three of them.  Oh.  And I have the one that I like the most.  All right.  Which is brand new. 
[01:02:30]  How many apnea masks are you up to?  I have...  Some really cool guy from...  I think ResMed sent me a bunch of samples, but I didn't buy them.  He just sent me a bunch.  I probably have 12.  That's a lot of apnea masks.  Oh, dude, it's awful.  It really is.  Now, unfortunately, because...  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Are you going scuba diving?  Because my mouth opens up when I sleep, this mask...  This is the best one.  It's the smallest one.  It goes right up your nostrils?  Yeah.  You put it over your head.  Oh.  And like this.  Ow.  And under your nose, like that. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, Jesus.  It's not bad at all.  Your nose is all scrunched.  Yeah.  But, I mean, you got air shooting right in there.  Yeah.  And then you plug this in.  Is it uncomfortable, though, with the nose all scrunched?  For me, the air shooting up my nostrils is a little uncomfortable.  No, no.  It's uncomfortable because I feel like I'm suffocating.  But it tries everything out, right?  No, you have a humidifier.  Oh.  And this is the one I like, that I prefer, I think.  I thought you liked the other one.  No, no.  I can't wear that one, unfortunately.  He's a prisoner in his own body. 
[01:03:30]  It's fucking horrible.  Wait, why can't you work?  Can my mouth open?  Like, when that air shoots in, my mouth goes.  And then it fucking shoots out my mouth.  It's really, my body is bent on killing me.  Look, it's like a snorkel.  What's the snorkely one?  This is a hybrid, which covers the mouth and the nose together.  Here's your hybrid.  Right.  Oh, there you go.  They have full face masks, which cover your mouth and nose like a snorkel.  But these are a little bit more comfortable.  Jesus.  I know.  Toughened your nipples. 
[01:04:00]  I couldn't sleep like that.  Well, welcome to the club.  God, you're clipping things on and you're...  You close it around your...  What sport uses that?  Like an IndyCar driver or something?  Yeah, like a Formula One.  But you see it goes up my nostrils.  Yeah, like a fighter pilot, too.  Up your nostrils and over your mouth.  Yeah, so it's not covering the top of my nose.  That's like a Bane mask.  Yeah.  And then you plug this onto the front.  The little alien tail.  And this gets plugged into the machine and you sleep. 
[01:04:30]  How about you just go to sleep?  I know.  Oh, Jimmy.  There he is.  That looks so uncomfortable.  But that's the one you like?  Of all of them, yeah, because it's not as claustrophobic.  You do get used to it like a little bit, but I haven't been able to yet.  Right.  But yeah, it does suck.  The option is just keep sleeping the way I've been sleeping, though, which is horrible.  Okay.  And where's number three?  Oh, it's just a full mask.  I'll pull that one out.  But it's uncomfortable.  And then what else is in there?  Just your little pillow?  Just my pillow, which I...  Your travel pillow?  No, actually, my hole.  And my fucking... 
[01:05:00]  Just afrin and just in case.  And what else did I bring?  Did you notice stuff up a lot?  Yeah, it's tough.  You need to use afrin a lot.  I try not to use it.  I wean myself off it, but...  Afrin's not good.  Afrin's rough.  Well...  This one is...  Oh, that's like a...  This is a full face mask.  Goes over full nose and mouth.  Yeah.  That's the most like the Bain mask.  Yeah.  This one goes like this.  Like this.  You've been tweeting these pictures, right?  That's a full mask.  Like this.  Oh, man, an eclipse thing. 
[01:05:30]  You should model all these and put it on Twitter.  Yeah, a little fashion show.  A little apnea mask fashion show.  I'm going to plug it in and you go,  Why won't anybody fuck me?  Why won't you do the whole show like that?  It's just for the apnea mask.  Yeah, but it is horrible.  I mean, it sucks.  But a lot of people have this shit happening, man.  And I got so many emails.  I can't...  Hundreds of people.  Really?  Contact me.  Yeah, it's amazing how many people have shitty sleep.  You know, I started tilting my head differently  and I'm getting a better night's sleep. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hmm.  I'd like tilt it up more.  To the side?  Up a little?  Well, I'd sleep on my side  and then I'd tilt up like this.  A little adjustment.  I seem to be sleeping a lot better.  Yeah, I mean...  I wonder what that's about.  I'm just hungry.  You just sleep, right?  I wake up, though...  I'm a shitty sleeper, too.  Not like Jimmy.  I mean, Jimmy's in a class by himself.  I've always had a shitty...  I'm a sleeping motherfucker.  But mine goes back to my mom waking us up  all the fucking times.  But I do wake up, like, 
[01:06:30]  in just wacky fucking positions on the bed.  Really?  I can wake up, like, across the bed  the opposite way I started.  You don't know how many people are jealous of that?  That's deep sleep shit.  Oh, I'm fucking sleeping like a motherfucker.  See, I don't...  Having my rapey-rape dreams and...  All that, huh?  Fucking...  It's fantastic.  Loving life.  I'm jealous.  It's a movie every night  in my fucking sleepy head.  Flying around raping girls.  Rape.  Flying.  Some flying rape.  Just rape.  Rape on the ground.  Oh, it's insane the amount of rape  that goes on in my dreams. 
[01:07:00]  You're lucky you sleep, dude.  You don't understand how lucky you are  to be all just too late.  I envy that.  Oh, I could sleep right now.  Watch me.  That would be great  if I could talk everybody into me sleeping  and it being, like, a bit.  I think, yeah.  Ant's going to go to the four seasons.  We're going to call Ant at noon.  Yeah.  We're going to do the rape thing now  instead of the Olympic beat game.  The Olympic beat game is really good.  But now that we're talking about rape,  we've got to go to the WWE.  They fucked up.  Somebody did.  Live on Raw last night? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Watch out.  Titus goes 6'6", 270 pounds.  Now, that's what I'm talking about.  Did you see that?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Titus O'Neil is like Kobe Bryant  at a hotel in Colorado.  He's unstoppable.  Those comments from AW.  You're the owner of all-world promotion.  Wow.  He got nothing for that.  Well, it wasn't.  It was just like...  But, I mean, no one even reacted  is what I'm saying.  No, well, it wasn't exactly topical. 
[01:08:00]  It's a Kobe Bryant joke.  It's an old rape joke.  Yeah.  A rape joke from an alleged rape  that took place like a year and a half ago.  But, you know, Vince McMahon...  It's longer than that.  Vince McMahon is behind the scenes  saying,  holy shit, get on mic.  The guy's a man...  Apologize.  The guy's a manager,  like an old-school manager,  but they leave a live mic on him  for the whole match.  Right.  And so I guess he just decided  that that would be a good time  to bust out a Kobe Bryant rape joke.  Well, the WWE got a little scared  and immediately apologized, right? 
[01:08:30]  No, they did.  Oh, yeah.  A little while in the broadcast.  Like one commercial break later.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So that's what I'm saying.  Vince McMahon was...  Immediately.  ...probably livid behind the scenes.  Oh, yeah.  And we're back live  on cable television's hottest show.  This is Monday Night Raw.  We would like to apologize,  ladies and gentlemen,  for the remarks made by AW moments ago.  But, speaking of remarks,  let's take you back for just a second  and look again at the remarks  made by CM Punk to John Cena.  Yeah, and their apology is very vague. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, they don't want to mention rape again.  And the Raw recaps and everything.  Remember that rape thing that he just said?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No references to it on the website or whatever.  He apologized.  The manager went on Twitter and apologized.  Wow, they really got scared, huh?  Yeah, I don't...  If he's back on TV at all,  he certainly won't have a live mic on him anymore.  He's not that good, huh?  Well, he's not great.  I mean, he's not worth a rape joke.  He's not that great,  and now he's doing rape jokes.  So you think he's done?  I mean, yeah, 
[01:09:30]  this isn't good for his career.  No.  Why would he...  Yeah, why...  They're doing a PG show  and trying to attract, like,  kids-friendly sponsors.  Years ago, that would have washed very well.  Yeah.  In the good old days of WWF.  They were crazy.  That's not the only controversy today.  Well, Linda McMahon's trying to run for office.  Yeah, exactly.  Is she really?  Yeah.  It didn't work out the first time.  Yeah, I've seen some spots.  Yeah.  Of her, uh...  Yeah.  It's not helping her.  Guys on TV running around talking about rape. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, rape jokes never help campaigns.  Uh, Artie Lang got suspended,  and we got the audio.  No one's got the actual audio, right?  Yeah, this is weird.  Artie Lang got suspended.  Not only did he get suspended,  but then he said on his Twitter, like,  he can't work with those people  and said, like, take it easy.  Right.  Like, like, like, he's leaving.  Then he deleted the tweet.  Oh, he did.  Well, then I think everyone got together  and said, calm down.  We got...  All right.  You can't just pee in a studio,  so we do have to... 
[01:10:30]  Is that what happened?  We have to suspend you for a couple days,  but calm down.  We like you.  I think that's what's going on here.  Yeah, DirecTV suspended him for two days,  and then he said,  I don't know why DirecTV suspended me,  but I can't...  Like Ant said,  I can't work for these people.  I can't work for these people.  Take it easy.  Right.  But then he deleted the tweets.  Right.  And he'll be back.  Oh, yeah, of course.  But it does provide good audio.  He peed in the studio?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've peed in the studio.  On a book.  On a book.  Maybe you don't admit it.  In a garbage pail.  Maybe we don't discuss that anymore.  Why? 
[01:11:00]  We're not allowed to play that one either anymore?  Well, you're not generally allowed to piss in the studio,  and right after somebody gets suspended  is not the time to run around being like,  yeah, I pissed in the studio, too.  Yeah.  It's all ex post facto.  We should take all the audio.  We're not allowed to play anymore  and have a podcast somewhere.  Or play it.  That's a good idea.  A year worth of podcasts.  We've got so much stuff  we're not allowed to play anymore  because of new rules.  Mm-hmm.  Even though it happened already.  Yeah.  And we can prove to whoever would get us in trouble 
[01:11:30]  that it already happened.  Yeah, I'm sure they'd allow that.  You think that'd be a problem?  Yeah, I think that might be.  Really?  All right.  It's a problem with everything.  Of course there is.  It's exhausting.  Artie Lang gets suspended for two days  from Nick and Artie for peeing in the studio.  Here's the audio and how it went down.  The guy said,  all we need is one pin, Rodney.  Oh, I don't know.  What, the sender?  Hand me that garbage can.  I got to take a pee.  I don't want to leave  because it's first segment.  I want to be professional.  I got the high blood sugar again, man.  I don't know what...  Well, we're going to break it in two minutes. 
[01:12:00]  I can't, but I'm incontinent.  Okay, while you're doing that,  let me read a few things  about the Olympic sex  that you don't know about.  They hook up in the village already,  you know, big time.  They hook up, you know, in...  Hey, Nick?  Yep.  Let me see.  Oh, you have to be kidding me.  I'm incontinent.  You know, it's one thing  if the wall was just sheetrock 
[01:12:30]  or wallpaper,  but it's this...  It's like this gabardine.  Get some hot towels.  It's like stuff...  A suit jacket's made out of.  Get some hot towels.  Hot towel?  What, are you having a baby now?  No, I got to wipe down the thing.  I want to sanitize it.  Apparently you never...  Nick, apparently you never got  a chocolate shake from Jersey Mike's.  Sounds good.  Just on the wall?  No, I got it all over my hand, too, Dan.  I can't touch anything.  We should take an early break, maybe.  We'll take an early break.  I'm going to take a dump on Dan's board.  Dan, what a show we got here.  You got to get hot towels. 
[01:13:00]  Get the broads with hot towels.  All right, he got so excited  about the opening Olympics  and seeing the queen  that he urinated.  But how do you urinate on your hand  and on the wall and stuff?  So keep in mind,  this is also...  Yeah, it's on terrestrial radio.  Oh, really?  So that's even worse.  But yeah, that was the sound of him  when he, like, screamed a little bit  and then said, look at this.  He peed all over the wall  and it's, like, the walls  are like we have here,  which is the fabric...  Yeah, it's like cloth-y fabric walls.  Soundproofing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Walls.  And also on the window.  So it absorbed in the piss.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  He must have lost a grip with his dick.  And it just went flying.  And it goes crazy sometimes, yeah.  After the break,  Artie explains that he peed  all over the wall by mistake.  I hate to bring the show down  after something like a big nugget.  And now they're all, like,  high on their horses,  you know what I mean?  They're all confident.  I have a medical condition.  Okay, I've been diagnosed  with type 2 diabetes.  I've been trying to keep that  out of the gossip column.  Diabetes, diabetes, diabetes.  Thank you, Dan.  Diabetes, diabetes, diabetes. 
[01:14:00]  Diabetes, diabetes, diabetes.  Thank you, Dan,  for breaking that up.  Diabetes, diabetes,  testing supplies.  Dan, you're horrible  at what you do for me.  So, I have type 2 diabetes.  This is going to be a big thing  on page 6 tomorrow, I'm sure.  Oh, okay.  The Inquirer.  Do you have type 2?  I have type 2 diabetes.  Officially?  Which means my pancreas works.  It produces insulin.  But I have high blood sugar,  which means I pee a lot.  It's a medical condition.  It's a serious medical condition.  I could lose my legs.  You're not a doctor.  So, the girls are real sensitive  when it comes to Mowgli  and animals and stupid crap. 
[01:14:30]  I was overcome  with type 2 diabetes symptoms  during the first segment tonight,  and I had to urinate badly.  Okay?  And instead of derelicting my duties,  as you girls would,  because you don't think about work,  I'm a workaholic.  I, instead of going to the bathroom,  asked Nick politely  for the garbage can  so I could take a leak in the can  and keep broadcasting,  which is what I'm paid to do.  Because I have type 2 diabetes  and I'm also morbidly obese,  which is another thing  that I could die from  and you girls don't care about. 
[01:15:00]  I'm working with BB King.  I went to,  that would be nice,  I went to,  I went to grab my penis  to urinate.  Disgusting.  And I hit my enormous stomach  and by mistake,  I missed the can  and urinated all over the window  and the wall.  Come on.  I can see how that would happen.  Really?  I don't know.  Can't you get control  of your penis right away?  I don't know.  He hit his gut.  Very funny, though.  He said,  I'm morbidly obese. 
[01:15:30]  I'm morbidly obese.  Oh, Artie.  Oh, Artie.  Just don't get fired  before I get you guys  on camera.  Oh, shit.  Artie tries to get the,  well, here's the last clip.  What are you doing  with the button, Dan?  Get away from that.  I'm on my computer.  No, you're not.  Get away from that.  Get away from the button.  Idiot.  So,  there's urine  all over the wall.  Correct.  So now, here's the thing.  You girls  are production assistants.  You're nothing. 
[01:16:00]  Right.  You're just lowly.  Scum.  Thank you, Marie.  Yes.  Now you're interesting.  Like the garbage can  you piss in.  Pretty much.  You're a dumpster  of stuff that comes out of me.  Oh, no.  Rephrase that.  That's not true.  Come on.  I know that.  There's some lines here.  Okay.  But no, no, no.  Your job,  I had urine on my hands,  so I had to rush  to the bathroom.  Is this a bad time  to mention I have  Crohn's disease?  Your job is to take  here, Nick's Crohn's disease. 
[01:16:30]  No.  Now your job,  because other people  use the studio.  Now you have to  get hot towels  and wipe my urine  off the wall.  Just because you piss  on the wall like a dog  doesn't mean I'm  cleaning it up.  No, no, no.  I made a mistake  because of my two  diseases.  Pee on yourself.  No, no, no.  I'm not cleaning this up.  I made a mistake  because of my two  diseases that could kill me.  My morbid obesity.  I don't care.  And my type 2 diabetes.  Your boss is sick.  Your boss is sick.  You knew you had a urine.  You felt it coming on.  Get up and go to the bathroom. 
[01:17:00]  I know.  I went and I got  a garbage can  and by mistake  because of my morbid obesity  I peed on the wall  and window.  It's your problem.  You have to clean it.  Your disease is your problem.  Not mine.  No, you have to get  hot rags and clean it.  What kind of broads are you?  I'm not that guy.  I don't clean up your piss.  You're sick.  You're disgusting.  What do you bring to the table?  No, not happening.  Can I mention the Yankees  beat the Red Sox?  I saw that.  No, so, so, so,  no, girls,  have up being a team player  right now.  No.  Redeem yourselves.  And stop saying the P word.  You understand?  That's not allowed on the air. 
[01:17:30]  This isn't the Hamptons.  It's some decanent party  you go to.  Get out of my sight.  Okay.  That went well.  Get out of my sight.  Oh, dear.  I would clean your urine  gladly off my kitchen table.  Dan, you're going to have  to clean it.  I'm sorry.  Are you willing to do it?  Yes.  Thank you.  You're a good man.  When you left the Olympics now.  When you left the Olympics.  When you left the Olympics.  When you left the room,  he's licking the wall.  There you have it.  The article I read, 
[01:18:00]  they're making a big deal  about him telling the girls  they have to clean it up.  And obviously,  it's all just fucking radio  and it's a goof.  It's so obvious.  Yeah.  But they're like,  and he was demanding  that the women PAs  clean it up.  That's not what I heard.  I heard some joking  going on there.  Yeah.  Wow, I didn't hear about that.  So, where is it at?  He's suspended  for a couple days.  Yeah, he got his  two-day suspension.  Yep.  And, I mean,  TMZ picked it up,  which is probably not great, 
[01:18:30]  but in the long run,  they'll let him back on  and it's probably actually  really good for their show.  Of course it is.  Oh, yeah, of course.  We all know that.  We all know that  controversy shit helps.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  So.  Jesus.  Well.  Yeah, take a piss, though.  See, that's odd  that he deleted  his tweet.  Why?  I don't know.  It seems like  he was going to leave.  Like, he was just going to say,  fuck them,  I'm not doing this anymore.  Well, then everyone  calmed down, obviously.  You think that's what happened?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, they got a good show.  There's no reason  to blow it up.  People, like, you know,  got to Artie and said,  let's calm down.  And then the other people said,  look, we have to do something,  obviously.  You can't just pee in the studio  and on the wall  and the window.  So you've got to understand  that part of it.  Yeah.  When I was listening to it,  it kind of everyone  just got calmed down.  It kind of sounded like  his producer, though,  was panicking  while it was going on.  When he was saying,  like, I know where the button is.  Right.  I think that was  the dump button.  Yeah, of course.  And the producer  kept saying, like...  Can we talk about the Olympics?  Can we talk about the Olympics?  I don't know if you heard  that at the end.  Oh, I didn't catch that.  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  And that's on regular radio?  It's on regular radio.  And serious,  but yeah,  it's on regular radio.  There's a lot of problems  if it's regular radio.  You can't say piss  or pee anymore.  Right.  You can't piss or pee.  Well, they're on after 10.  They may have more leeway  as far as language  because of the hour.  10 o'clock at night?  Yeah.  That's a 10 p.m. show.  Yeah, maybe a little bit.  In a long form.  The safe harbor.  That's the safe harbor area.  In a long form clip,  they did yell at one  of the female interns  because she said  they can't say piss.  I think they can say pee,  but not piss.  Oh, right.  Yeah, you're in a row.  That's the thought. 
[01:20:00]  Nah, but stupid fools.  The FCC's not going to do anything  with them saying piss  in the end.  All right.  I'm sure they'll be all right.  Yeah, I hope so.  Hey, the Olympic beep game  when we get back.  All right.  And also,  we've been waiting for this.  John Sterling  had to do an Ichiro.  Ichiro.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Home run call.  Home run call.  How about that, huh?  So let's see what he came up with next.  Stay there.  The OPN at HL.  On Sirius XM.  Laugh your tears away.

[01:23:30]  Sirius XM  This is the OPN3 Show  So we got John Sterling  This is going to be our sports break  John Sterling  John Sterling's home run call  Which everyone seems to love  Oh boy  Across the country, by the way  A lot of people didn't even know who John Sterling really was 
[01:24:00]  Now they do  It's on Deadspin  It's on Deadspin  This one's on Deadspin  This one's on Deadspin  Along with some other suggestions for what he could have done with Ichiro  That would never make it on the air  His Ichiro call is really stupid  I expected more  It's really stupid  Yeah  Did you hear it?  And you know why, right?  It should be this  And let's go to Deadspin  I want to know what people thought  Exactly what they should have been  Thought the home run call was  It should have been this  Because he went 
[01:24:30]  Oh, you didn't know?  No  Does it matter?  No, I  Well, I'd like to hear it  Yeah, we'll play it  And then  Let me just hear it  Yeah, okay  Well, we're going to  We're going to do the warm-up home run call first  Ah  This is the one  Right before Ichiro  Yes  Uh-oh  So Ichiro has  Well, you just wait  Oh, boy  Oh, no  Is it a back-to-back  And a bury-to-bury?  I apologize for my stereotypical run 
[01:25:00]  Of course  It's very hurtful  Here's your opening band  Before Ichiro  Now, the right-handers pay off  Swung on  There it goes to deep right  It is high  It is far  It is good  In the second deck  Eric Chavez  He and Ivana  It's been the whole offense  Eric Chavez  Homers  To deep right  Chavez  Ultravez  And the Yankees  Now trail  5-3 
[01:25:30]  What?  What?  What?  What was that?  Chavez  That was Eric Chavez's home run  Uh-huh  Ultra what?  Ultravez  I don't get it  I don't either  I don't get it  Ultra's better than regular  I guess, right?  But isn't he just who he is?  Yeah  Ugh  No  I mean  It doesn't make sense  But he goes into ultra mode  When he hits home runs  Yes  I know what he should have said  Instead of Chavez  He should have said  Ayatollah-vez 
[01:26:00]  So then Ichiro  Came up to bat  And well  Here it is  We've been waiting  For the John Sterling  Home run call  With extra commentary  At the end  Oh good  Susan Wallman  All the features  This is great  John  What they don't have  In the genitals  They really make up for  In the bat  And deals  Swung on and  Hit in the air  To deep right  That ball is high 
[01:26:30]  It is far  It is gone  In the second deck  Ichiro  The Yankees  Rising sun  Says  Sayonara  In the second deck  In right  And the Yankees  Now trail  5  4  Not only was that  His first home run  As a Yankee  That was his  100th career  Home run  Standing ovation  For Ichiro  They want him  To do well  So badly  And big smile  On his face  She loves the smiles 
[01:27:00]  Oh my god  But the rising sun  The guy's at the end  Of his career  So why would you go  With rising sun  That was the note  I was writing  That's stupid  But that's because  It's Japanese  The rising sun  Is the flag  The Japanese flag  Yeah alright  But I mean  That's probably why  Fair enough  I just think  It sounds a little  Racist  Do you think  It's more racist  Than the ones  That Deadspin put up  Let's see what  Deadspin put up  Where is it  A mega jack 
[01:27:30]  From the mega jack  Did they put that  Well Deadspin said  At least it wasn't  These  A head turner  From the rice burner  It's a round trip  For the new  Alright  Yeah those are  That's not even  Trying  No no  You gotta get a little  Ichiro's tough though  Because you can't  Rhyme it with anything  Right Chip  Sure you can  Oh  Ichiro  Ichiro  Have a chance  Of catching the ball  Or something  Oh no  That's fucking good 
[01:28:00]  So then they went  To commercial  Then they go to commercial  Because there was  A pitching change  And then  They come back  After a three minute  Commercial break  But that doesn't get  In between  John Sterling  And his catchphrases  Here's Russell Martin  To hit for Stewart  The Yankees trail  Now 5-4  Three solo home runs  By  Abanis  And a listening  By Chavez  And Ichiro  Chavez and Ichiro  Go back to back  In a belly to belly  In the Yankees  Trail 5-4 
[01:28:30]  So Martin  Hits for Stewart  Three minutes later  Why do people  Like this  We're in the minority  Now  It's just  I know we are  It's the fact that  That he has to say  Like he probably has  Like an OCD thing  Where even though  It's been three and a half minutes  Since  He went off  Fuck I didn't do  The belly to belly  He had to say it  Guess what  You don't have to this time  That's all  We're in a minority though  We're the minority  People love it  No we're not 
[01:29:00]  I've turned so many people  Against Sterling  Good  Even Estee at the cellar  Estee at the cellar  Who the Yankees  Could do no  Literally  No wrong  There's nothing  They can do wrong  As far as she's concerned  Yeah  She has begun to hate him  I don't like him  Really  I'm so happy  I don't like him  I don't like him  She's a hardcore Israeli  I'm so happy I turned her  Nice  Alright  He had to get the back to back 
[01:29:30]  And belly to belly out  He had to  Even though it wasn't spontaneous  It wasn't  Just  Leave it alone that time  Just taking care of business  He'll have another chance  To say back to back  Billy to belly  Not this time though  He had to  Is he good  Since the Yanks picked him up  Yeah  He's alright  He's doing his job  He was having kind of a shitty year  Right  And then the Yankees  Were hoping he could turn it around  He's at the end of his career  What is he  He's 38  38  38  Is that old for baseball these days  I don't know  Sure 
[01:30:00]  I don't know  Yeah  You're not paying a 38 year old  A shit load of money  A-Rod's 37 right  Yes  I just got with a broken hand  Yeah  And now Teixeira's out too  Oh man  You guys are in trouble  Both guys are ex-Mariners too  Oh  H-R-O and A-Rod  Look at that baseball facts  And also Randy Johnson  Who they took in  A lot of ex-Mariners  Although Edgar Martinez  Never became a Yankee  Neither did Jay  Is it Buehner?  Yeah  Oh Thomas 
[01:30:30]  No  There was another one  Well he didn't either  Who was the  Jamie Moyer  Oh Jamie  Never became a  A Yankee  Wow  The devil  We haven't heard the devil in a while  That was a great burpee  Yeah  Jimmy  So now we go back to the Olympics  I love it  Jim Norton  Are you watching the Olympics?  No not at all  You missed synchronized diving  We did 20 minutes on it  I enjoy teasing it on the show  Like I like watching it  Well yeah of course  But I literally have no interest in it

[01:56:30]  You wanna get some Rita's  No  It opens at ten though  I don't want water ice  We're going to Larchmont at eleven  Well you guys have fun  We're not  Have fun in Larchmont  This fucking asshole  So  Not only does he want us to go  He wants us to wait  So he does his hour show  And then we can all go  And get our dumb hot dogs  You can be guests on the show  No  And then we'll go and get  Hot dogs and water ices  Yeah that's what I wanna do  Is do my show here  And then sit here  For another hour  To do your show  And then we can finally go  Why wouldn't you suggest  I'll blow off my hour

[01:57:30]  In Williamsburg  I don't give a shit  What it is  I'm not buying  A fucking car battery  It's not your typical  Flea market  It's a place where  It's a foodie  It's a foodie place  Where these guys  Don't have space yet  For their restaurants  I know a bakery  In Scarsdale  I'll hook up the donuts  We're not going to Scarsdale  Oh it's the greatest bakery  You've ever been to  I'll hook up the donuts  Scarsdale  I think I'm all good  Dunkin Donuts  I think I'm all good  Exactly  Dunkin Donuts  Is the best donuts anyway  No it's like ass  Crispy cream was good  No you've never been  To this bakery in Scarsdale  Most would say

It's a diner  Oh yeah  That looks good  Long Island diners 
[01:59:00]  Are the best diners  No no no  In the country  They'd be Jersey diners  Jersey diners  Westchester diners  All diners are the same  Fucking shithole  No Long Island diners  Are great  There's no such thing  As a great diner  Or a lousy diner  They're all the same  I mean as far as  A diner goes  You gotta go with  Your Long Island  Fucking late at night  The bars are closed  You go ahead in there  For some eggs  And shit  That's fucking great  Much different  Than a Jersey diner  Much different  Than a Pennsylvania  There's all actually  One diner  And they move it  From fucking place to place  How about this 
[01:59:30]  Mount Olympus  On Central Ave  What?  Mount Olympus  On Central Ave  Oh Greek diner  Oh wow  The Greeks  That's where we'll go  That's where we'll go  For dinner  Very good  What do you want  That's where we'll go  They have shitty service  But damn  Is their food good  It's good  There's always some busboy  With a giant mole  On his head  And he brings the water  Over to you  With one finger  In the glass  Fucking diners  And they can't get  The glasses quite clean  No no  They're always just  A little off  Coffee cup with lipstick  And it just smells like  Egg yolk 
[02:00:00]  Then you're the problem  Because you're like  I don't really want  Lipstick on my coffee cup  I'm sorry  I'm short little  Fucking Mexican  Some cartel guy  Is bringing my water  With his fingers  In the water  Then they bring out  Some pickle relish shit  That was probably used  For five other tables  Because no one  Eats that garbage  You don't go  With the coleslaw  No  Coleslaw on the pickles  No  Oh that's delicious  Big fucking hair  Woman from the 50's  Comes over  Takes your order  She's been there forever  Penciling her hair  How you doing honey 
[02:00:30]  Shut up  Flo  I hate  If we're gonna do this bit  Let's do it  I hate the waitresses  That have to memorize  The fucking order  Write it down bitch  And they move their eyes  Up in the air  Like okay  This is how I memorize shit  And they're like  Oh great  I gotta change something  But I guess  I'll just take something  I didn't want  Because I don't want  To confuse her  Right  Oh man  I hate that  It's too stressful  For the table  Just picture  After everyone leaves  She sits down  At one of the stools  At the counter  Takes her shoe off  Stuts massaging

Cementas  That's weird  Cementas  That's Spanish for semen sandwich  Oh  I didn't know  It sounded like you were saying  Cement dust  Cement  What the fuck is in it?  Tell him your weakness  Cement dust on a roll  We all know  Pizza?  What?  Food?  Pizza? 
[02:04:30]  Tell him your weakness  What?  I don't know how to say it  The sausage  Sausage?  Which one?  What?

I'm really good  We were talking about shitty food  And you were outside the studio  We should have just waved in  I'm sorry about that  Ari's playing the Stress Factory  This weekend 
[02:06:30]  Starting Thursday  Starting Thursday  Yeah  Thursday, Friday, Saturday  Nice  Yeah  Kurt Metzger's going to open for me  Really?  Kurt's a funny dude  He's hilarious  That's a good show  Between you and Kurt  Nice  He's working out his hour  What's he doing in September?  Yeah  Everyone's doing hours now  It's like years ago  I'm not saying that he doesn't deserve it  It's like years ago  There was like five comics  That did them  And now it's  It's Comedy Central  It's like everyone kind of  Gets a shot at doing them  I remember Kevin James  And Wanda Syce doing one  It was like that was big news  Right, right  You know  So I did an hour special  It was like all everybody talked about 
[02:07:00]  Really?  Yeah  We started together in Montreal  Ari was on the show that I was on  How was Montreal?  So much fun  I love it up there  I wanted to go  Dude  I went when we were off the air  Mushrooms started going around  Huh?  Mushrooms started going around at some point  Really?  Yeah, it was so great  At that like final party  Every third person was just like  Would look through you  And you're like  Oh, you're on them too, huh?  It was so great  You like mushrooms?  I love them, man  Awesome  When's the last time you did some?  Oh, man  I did mushrooms  Forever 
[02:07:30]  Oh, God, yeah  Wait, that's not even worth mentioning  Forever  20 years ago?  I've never done  What?  What?  I don't do drugs in Cougs  Oh, that's right  I've been  It's such a funny response from people  I don't get high  It's not drugs  It's all natural, pal  It's like you came out of the closet in high school  Like, ooh, all right  Last time I did coke was late 80s  Pot, 1990, believe it or not  Wow  Although I went back in with the pot  Mushrooms probably before that 
[02:08:00]  Probably, I want to guess, 87-ish  Dude, you've got to do them once a year  Well, I don't think you're wrong  How do they make you feel?  I've never  Mushrooms  That was fun  Yeah  I was always scared that I was going to take too much  But I like the mushrooms  But there's never any really too much  No one wants to freak out  I guess, that's what they say  No one wants to freak out  And there's always people  The back of their mind is always like  I could freak out this time  This could be the time I freak out 
[02:08:30]  Yeah  So it's never this thing where you always take mushrooms or fucking acid or mescaven or something  And just go like, yeah, this is good  It's always in the back of your head  You could freak out  Yeah  Our thing when I was living in Rochester  It was tradition to take mushrooms and go to the jazz festival  Nice  Fuck, that was a good combination  I bet  It really was  I bet  You're like, this music is the greatest I've ever heard  And I don't know  I would hear raindrops on leaves  It was fucked up  I heard some shit 
[02:09:00]  I'm like, what?  This is what your ears could really do?  Yeah  Because I know I was actually hearing it  There's no doubt in my mind  I took them at the UFC a couple times  Really?  Yeah  That's crazy  That's great  Can you hear bones crushing?  You can hear conversations from like across the stadium  Thank you  I've said it on the show where we were all fucked up  And now we're, you know, the jazz festival's all day  So now we're sort of almost napping  And someone's yapping  And I turn to my friend  I'm like, can you tell them to shut the fuck up?  And I looked  And they were way the fuck down the hill 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, you could hear shit  Yeah  What's that about?  It's, I don't know  Tapping in or something  It's weird, but you can't  Yeah, it's gotta be some part of your brain  Gets like fucked up  It's wild  And there's no way you can hear them, right?  You're just tuned  Huh? No  You can't really  You're just imagining it all  Yeah, they're not really  Oh, you think you're just imagining it?  But it sounds so real  It does sound real  I'm convinced it's real, sorry  I've heard shit that sounded like talking  When I've been doing like acid or something like that  It's like  But it's more of a 
[02:10:00]  And it's like  It sounds like  I'm trying to hear  Don't say anything  No, you're freaking out  You're an asshole  Shut up  Don't make me freak out  You've actually done acid?  Years ago  Years ago  I was way too fucking scared to do that  Years and years  How often do you smoke pot with Rogan?  Like I've never  I quit long before I ever met Joe  Yeah  But if I was going to smoke pot with anybody  I would want to smoke with him  I think he'd be a fun guy to get high with  Always  I just can't  Whenever I see him, pretty much  He made me get high before I went on stage the first time 
[02:10:30]  Whoa  Yeah, it was in Boston  How'd that work out?  Terrible  It was awful  We were doing that Faneuil Hall place  And it was in this hotel room  Like ten minutes before I was going on  I was like, oh, there's no way  I won't be good  And he's like, you're working for me  This club is way too big for you  I was like, yeah, I guess you're right  What a dick, that's funny  He was like, but I don't care  And man, I forgot my bits halfway through  Did he care?  No  Not at all  Not at all  I remember saying, like 
[02:11:00]  Couldn't think of a bit  And then going like  Um, Joe Rogan will be out in a second  And everyone started cheering  I'm like, what a terrible thing to say  Oh, man  How do I steal focus for myself?  When was that?  That was like five, six years ago  Oh, that's so fun  That's recently  You were doing stand-up for a while  Yeah  That's very funny  I can't imagine going on stage high  Like, that scares me  The idea being  Like, Joe can do it  And a lot of guys can do it  And go on and function  And be fucking hilarious  And smart  But  Yeah  I would forget everything  It helps you riff a little bit 
[02:11:30]  You know, where you're just like  Let me explore this  I think a couple of beers  Does that too  Loosens you up  Somehow loosen you up  Yeah  But the old  The old graph  Kind of goes  Hey, you're better  You drink a little more  Better, better, better  Bam  And then it's just a  Huge drop-off  Yeah  The drop-off is unbelievable  It's like a company  Reporting bad earnings  Wham!  Straight the fuck down  I've been obliterated before  On stage on pot  And that's always worse  Yeah, huh?  Yeah  Have you taped those shows? 
[02:12:00]  I haven't on my iPhone  Yeah, and you're like  Maybe it was actually pretty good  And you're listening  And you're like  No, no  It was terrible  Really?  Now, that's what I want to know  About riffing  Is it actually that you're riffing better  Or is it that you're high  And you feel like you are  And you're freer to say  Awful things  That a sober mind would go  Don't say that  That's awful  There was that episode  Of Facts of Life  Where the rich girl  What's her name?  Blair  Blair, yeah  She had to write this report  And she couldn't do it  And then she got high  And she was like  I wrote it  It was actually really good  And the next day  She woke up  And it was one 
[02:12:30]  Like one word per page  For six pages  She wrote a  And she thought that was good?  Well, she thought that  On pot  Oh, my God  She wrote it  Like she thought  It was going to come out  Looking like Joe  But it came out  Looking like her cousin Jerry  Anybody?  I got it  I got it  I got it  I guess they were trying  To make a statement  That pot's bad  Oh, of course  Yeah  Never  Not good  One word  Couldn't they have done it  A little bit more  Thank you  Exactly  That would never happen  We get it  You're saying pot's bad  She would have written 
[02:13:00]  Like a 40 page essay  That would have happened  Yeah, yeah  Right  What happened was  She thought she wrote  A good report  Then she realized  She put her shoes  In Edna Gara's cunt  Edna Gara  See  Now if I was on stage  I would have thought  That was a great improv  If I was high  But instead of realizing  That I fucking dropped the ball  Are you doing LSD still?  Yeah  Someone said  How do you feel about  Really clean LSD?  I don't even know what that means  I don't do it enough to know  I'm scared of acid  I do it once in a while  But I'm scared of it  See  Because you don't know  What the fuck's in that, right?  Yeah  I don't know  It's because of those people  That talked to my high school  Like that Coke and LSD 
[02:13:30]  Was the things that I always thought  Yeah  That'll ruin your life  Or something  I don't know  Yeah, those are the drugs  They talked about  That would like  Wow  You know  Guy did drugs back in the 60s  And he's still all fucked up  Oh yeah  He's still fucked up  It's like what?  That chick can just stay with you?  What?  Well the Pink Floyd dude  He was all fucked up  Sid  Yeah  There's a dude Mike  That walks around  Have you ever seen Mike?  Mike?  He's a stellar  He's a guy that walks around  People say he used to play with Dylan  And he's in  If you're in Greenwich Village  Here in New York 
[02:14:00]  You know this guy  He walks around  He touches everything  And he's always  Completely out of it  But they say he did acid  In the 60s  And he just never came out  And that's what made him that way?  That's what the word is  That's the rumor  Yeah, but he was a decent musician  Oh come on  It has to be something else too  That's how I feel about Rick Shapiro  That he just sort of  Burnt out on something  But at least  But Rick is  He's coherent at least  Like Rick is at least  Creatively  He's a little whacked out  But he's  He's not gone  Like Rick is here  Yeah  He's just  He's got like an intense vibe to him 
[02:14:30]  Why was he different back in the day?  I don't know  I didn't know him back in the day  It just seems like  He's striking  But if you don't know Rick  He does strike you as a guy  Who seems like he's out of it  But he's much more with it  Than I think people think  Because I did Lucky Louie with him  And he was on time every day  Always knew his line  Like  Oh really?  Yeah, yeah  Rick's a  And his act is always evolving  And changing  Yeah, he's a funny dude  He was funny in that show too, man  He was brilliant  What else did you do in Montreal?  Oh, I can curse here  I stopped myself  I was like  Oh, finally I caught myself  And I'm like  I don't have to  I just fucked her out 
[02:15:00]  I did my storyteller show  Just drug and alcohol stories  We did fuck stories last year  Fuck stories  I would love to be on the fuck stories show  The drug and alcohol one  I just didn't feel like I could contribute  Because I've been sober for more  Yeah  Oh yeah  You got a couple of good blowouts  And then  Like I sort of remember  Yeah  Something  That's where Monster Rain came from  It is  One of those theme shows  I happened to be up in Montreal  And I took  I took a waitress's sharpie  And went  Holy fuck  2003  Because he  What?  He told this Monster Rain story  And then it's now legendary on the show  And we go back to it all the time 
[02:15:30]  Confessing it  You probably would have mentioned it on your own  On the show  But I don't know  I don't know if it would have occurred to me  Holy fuck  What was the theme of that show?  It was called Confessing it  Confessing, right  Where you had a show  And Colleen Hawley  And you confess something  That you've never told publicly before  I heard about that  So I told two stories  I told the tranny story  That's what I heard about  And fucking  The Monster Rain game  I don't remember the tranny one  I remember Monster Rain  That was when I fucked the tranny with no bag  I really didn't know it was a tranny  Whoa  With no condom?  Yeah  But the Monster Rain story 
[02:16:00]  Was when I was a kid  Or he's like  Wow  I take chances  But fuck  I just walked it off  Walked it off  Walked it off  Walked it off  That's what T.S. told me that once  He goes  Norton went up there  And talked about fucking a tranny  That's when everybody knew  He was legit  Oh Joey?  Yeah  But I love those theme shows man  Like the fucked one  I would love to have talked to  It's different than what you guys do  It's much different  It challenges you a little bit, right?  It's a little slower too  And yeah 
[02:16:30]  You can get into some stuff  Yeah I liked it when I checked it out  But that's where Jimmy got the Monster Rain  And now we all  Yeah and he kind of laughs on stage  It makes you do a story  Bird does my show a lot  And he'll do like stuff  Like he'll remember things on stage  While he's doing it  And just start laughing  He's like  Fuck I haven't thought about this guy in 20 years  And then just go into some  They're fun  Well the show that you did  You have that  I did Ari's show in L.A. recently  I was out when I was doing Leno  And it was a drug and alcohol story  But I just had to run my set  So I went on  I had to though  Because it was a big show 
[02:17:00]  So I went on and just ran my set  And it went fine  Yeah  But at the end I was like  I was really drunk when I did that stuff  And I was like  That's your contribution  I felt bad  But it's funny  I had to run a set  You know  Sorry  It had to be done  The guy from the improv called me  Sarah Silverman just canceled  Like five minutes before  He called me and said  Can Norton go up  And I was like scrambling to find somebody  I was like  Oh yeah that's perfect  And I was like asking him  If we'll do like a drug or alcohol story  And then the guy's like  Dude he's been sober for like 20 years  And I'm like  Yeah  From drugs and alcohol 
[02:17:30]  Yeah  I could  I absolutely have drug and alcohol stories  But I literally had to run an eight minute set there  But oh yeah  I mean I could definitely tell  I just don't know if they'd be funny  Yeah  Yeah  They're stories without a point  We did a hooker one too  That was good  I'd be embarrassed  You'd have to send out the guy from the Apollo at the hook  To pull me off  I have no non-hooker stories  And then there was the time  Yeah we'd have to break it down  Two hours in  You'd have to break it down by race  What their affliction was  Causing them to prostitute  It's even the subcategories 
[02:18:00]  That's funny  You're watching the Olympics are you?  Fuck no  I say that because we got it on one of our TVs now  They're shooting  Oh yeah  I guess it's a little skeet shooting or trash  Off-brand sports  Men's skeet  Oh a little skeet  Have you ever done skeet shooting at?  I've done some skeet  Is it hard?  It's really hard right?  It's not easy  I did it in Indianapolis  Yeah  It's so much fun  It is fun  It's fun as fuck man  When you pull up one of those discs  Yeah  God it feels good  It does  It's like oh I fucking hit it 
[02:18:30]  Yeah  How did I do that?  How many times though?  One out of a thousand?  I was one for twenty  These guys are amazing  It just seems like too much pressure  Like you know like if you're aiming at a fucking can  You can kind of relax  Yeah  It's moving  It just seems like all the shouting and noise  That guy did it like it was nothing  Oh this guy  I know it's the Olympics  But fuck  Look  He doesn't even move  He's like  We're watching this guy  Wow  Whoa  Two 
[02:19:00]  He just gets two  He shot two?  Yeah  And he just walks out like yeah  I can't even see the little skeet things  It just blows up  Hey Luigi  So that's the dust from it?  Yeah  Yeah  The pink dust there  Wow  I guess an Olympic skeet shooter is good  I'm watching this now  And I can literally not see  Really?  There  Boom  Boom  Oh the pink dust is them?  Yeah  As it blows up  I thought that was a fucking lens flare thing  So how do they make this harder?  Because these guys can do this all day  You fire at a child once in a while 
[02:19:30]  And you can't shoot at it  Yeah  The human target  I  Oh they're pink  I see  Okay  That looks easy  Well that was a  Piece of cake  That was the boring angle  Have you ever seen the videos of Iraqi  Like US soldiers  Killing people with a spray?  Oh man  Yeah  With a pink spray  That's pretty fucked up  Yeah  Yeah the snipers  That just like  Blow their heads off  From like hundreds of yards away  Pink mist  Yeah  I like the ones that are from the gunships  That are flying over  And it's like that  Forward looking infrared camera 
[02:20:00]  And you just see groups of people  Just being  Pretty much butchered  What?  By giant shells  You just hear like  Uh huh  And you watch people explode  It's fucked up  And then there's body parts  Laying there with a heat signature  Because they're still kind of warm  But it's like an arm and a head  It's spread out right?  Yeah  And they're all fucked up  Spread all over the place  It's amazing how many people  Oh man  Are just being exploded over there  Yeah  Just exploded 
[02:20:30]  They like walk outside  They're just talking normally  There's a ship  Like a mile away  And it's fucking night time  Imagine it's night time  You got your  You know  Your buddies  And you're like  Blah blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  And it's quiet  And you just sit  And then you just start  Your friend just explodes  In front of you  Like ah  And there's nowhere to run  You must like  You can't run away  Yeah it must be like  What happened?  And then you figure it out  And you're like  Fuck  They see me  Because then they start  You see them running  And it's like  Where are you running?  Just stop

[02:21:30]  Yeah  Why are you guys  Talking about this  I'm watching this  It's boring man  There's gotta be  A better way to do that  I guess  People occasionally miss  And then it's like  Oh he missed  Holy shit  Whoa  Yeah  I don't know  That's not my favorite  Type of shooting  I just like basic  I like real long distance shooting  With a nice  Fucking rifle and scope  Or pistol shooting  Why don't they have like  Laser tag or something  Like against other people  That would be kind of cool  Yeah  That's something against  It's not crazy 
[02:22:00]  If you really look at  Some of the sports  They are doing  A lot of time sports  Laser tag  That would be great  That would be right  Laser tag  Paintball  Paintball  Paintball  Paintball competition  Olympic paintball team  Chess  That would be kind of cool  Alright Jimmy  Jimmy really wants  Olympic chess  Which you know  Chess being a sport  With a court  You know  I don't know  But if that bad man  Why not chess  Yeah ping pong  Ping pong  Why not chess  Yeah  At least the ball is moving  Ribbon play  Whatever the fuck that  Ribbon shit is  Just watch someone concentrate  Sure why not  Is the night going this way

[02:25:00]  Yeah  I love his voice  Like it's like a black joke  You never wanted  Even when I was  I didn't admit that  Yeah you just don't  You didn't say it  You just didn't say it  Well maybe that one time  I might have  Right  Not  Well I'm a virgin  Well actually everyone  I'm a virgin  Actually I'm a virgin  I was a virgin  Until I was 23  Were you really?  Jesus  I was waiting for the white girl  Stupid shit  What the hell was going on?  Whatever  I don't know  That wasn't religious shit?  23  Well until I was like 18 or 19 
[02:25:30]  It was religious stuff  And then  I was late  I was 18  Late 18  Jeez Louise  I was late 18  You guys are insane  Late 18  Freshman in college  Is when it finally happened  Yeah  Yeah college is a great place  You're Jewish  Were you like religious Jewish?  Or like  No I was super religious  Until like  Until like 21  Wait  Like not Hasidic  Which one?  Orthodox  Orthodox  What was that  I lived in Israel  For a couple of years  What are you saving up to be?  Jewish?  I love that one  I might not have heard that before 
[02:26:00]  It's the UNICEF and Platoon  Platoon  Oh really?  Yeah  Oh man I haven't seen that in forever  ALP  I'm sure we talked about all this with you  But it's been a while  Did you have the payas?  I had just the starts of one  Starts of the payas  The little starts of the payas  You look  But you look  You look  You would look good in payas  Yeah I look dewy  You would look  Especially when I grew my beard out  When I grew my beard  I look like less  Like a degenerate  You could pull that off  Did you have to shave your head too?  No  Shave your head with the start of the payas  I didn't do that  I say that at B&H a lot  I don't know  I just don't want my B&H knowledge 
[02:26:30]  Dude I saw fucking  Locked Up Abroad  It was the fucking  This Hasidic  Like cocaine smuggler guy  It was great  This guy  I mean all the whole garb  And he really was  He wasn't just dressed up like it  But he had payas  The hat  The fucking coat  The whole deal  And he was taking fucking coke  Yeah those guys get down sometimes  Dude it was crazy  This guy was like gangster too  And he hooked up in Brazil  With some other Hasidic gangsters  Really?  Down there  And he was transporting fucking coke  Back to like England 
[02:27:00]  They're degenerates too  A lot of them like  I know dominatrices that have said  They are dirty  They didn't fuck with them  At the airports  Because they thought  Because they just were like  He's like  You can't check the religious guys really  And they just  He just went right through  With this fucking coke  I saw in Montreal  One of them letting out  Of his car  Just a fat black hooker  Really?  Yeah  Out of his car  Dirty boys  Dirty boys  Yeah  They're very naughty  They said he's very naughty  But we've heard they're very naughty  But doesn't that go against the religion?  Absolutely  But people get  You know  You get tempted 
[02:27:30]  Yeah but  It's just with their dress  But why wouldn't you be tempted  And wear a baseball cap?  Oh  Why would you fuck with the  No I'm just saying  Why fuck with the sex angle  Of your religion  That seems like  It would be scary shit  As far as  The lord goes  Oh yeah  You just don't think about it  I guess  Right  So you're breaking a major rule  By having sex with a black hooker  And then you're still going to  Go around  Your days with the payas  And everything else  Yeah it seems hypocritical  Right  Of course  Remember that  Hasidic guy that murdered that kid? 
[02:28:00]  Yes  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Fuck that guy  You don't hear about that often  Like you don't like  Hasidics that do that  Yeah it stands out  They take care of their own though  You want to talk about a community  Yeah  Holy fuck  Oh you mean  Protect their own  Oh yeah  Oh I thought you meant  That kid  Oh and they probably  Take care of her  You know what  You mean take care of her?  I fucked that up  But I'm sure they take care too  Yeah  I'm sure they do a little of that as well  My mom explained it to me once  Why we have to go to like  Jewish dentists  And Jewish everything  Oh  She was like  Nobody else is looking out for us 
[02:28:30]  Oh really?  We gotta help each other  So you guys would look  You would look for a guy  To be Jewish  If you went to  Anything  A dentist  If you don't go to Jewish dentists  They're like  Is it safe?  Is it safe?  Oh yeah  See I never think of that  I had a Hasidic Jew  Come in and do my air conditioners  Yeah  Nice  It was good  Oh wow  It was a service  Nice  I see them now  He wouldn't shake my wife's hand though  But he did bow  He bowed to her?  Well not bowed  Whatever  What is the move?  Like kind of acknowledging 
[02:29:00]  But he's like  Hi how are you?  Yeah but I can't touch women  Yeah you can't touch  Did he say that?  No it was obvious  She put her hand out  And he went like  He put his hands close  Like make sure you  Isn't it only during a period?  No you can't touch  You can't touch your own wife  During that time  During a period?  Yeah  What a great guy's rule that is  That rule should be across the board  I bet you  Sorry babe  I don't know  Whoever's the biggest hero  For that one  Fuck  I don't know who the highest  Hasidic is  In the hierarchy  But I guarantee you 
[02:29:30]  He's the one who came up  With that rule  He's like  Don't touch us on our periods  Yes elevate him  There's a rule in the Talmud  That said if she gets on her period  If she starts a period  While you're fucking her  This is what you're supposed to do  You're supposed to  It doesn't say fucking  But you're supposed to  Stop moving  Don't pull out  Stop pumping  Look away and up  And think of  Because you're only  Fuck missionary I guess  Yeah  Think of the grace  And anger of God  Until you're  They say until your  Member has been softened  Yeah  They make a colloquialism  And then slowly pull out  Why can't you pull out with a rod? 
[02:30:00]  I don't know  Why can't you just dump your jizz?  I don't know  No you can't dump your jizz  It's probably seen as a waste of semen  Because she's pushing it out  Maybe that's what it is  You can't waste a rod  You're not supposed to waste a rod  You should come  Make the old  What I call the parfait  Wonderful  Yeah  Don't talk about blue balls at all  And that at all  No  You're probably supposed to  Feel the fucking pain  You filthy pig  They're probably thinking  That because you're wasting seed  Because her body  Is emptying  That if you come 
[02:30:30]  It's a waste  So you should think of  The wrath of God  Of wasting seed  Right  Wait so are your parents  Still really religious?  Yeah  They got mad at me  They got mad at me  Are they okay with you?  They are now  My dad said I was lower  Than a dog  Because even a dog  Has an innate sense of God  Oh wow  Thanks for making this easy Pop  That's brutal  Wait you have no God now?  Nothing  Oh that's gotta hurt him  Yeah  But fuck it  Whatever  I don't believe  What am I supposed to do?  So you didn't eat cheeseburgers  And all that? 
[02:31:00]  Were you one of those?  Nothing  None of that shit  Do you now?  Delicious  Yeah  Harry if you remember  Did my Down and Dirty show  And he was very funny  And he pulled down his pants  At the end of it  Which I thought was great  And his fucking knee  He was dick and balls bear  And they got really mad at him  For that  And I was like  That's a great alive moment  On the show  They left that in  They left it  They cut like a quarter second  And then show my ass  For most of it  I loved you for doing that  Yeah you really stepped up  And defended me for that  Yeah  They were really mad at me  And the next day they came in  Like no we loved it 
[02:31:30]  What are you talking about?  It was my first like version  Of like fake Hollywood  And then I heard like  You yelled at them  Like are you crazy?  That's fine  Wow  So what turned you?  I had this thought  That  Alright here's what it was  I just have a cock  I was just like  This is so delicious  I have to have it  Inside me  It looks beautiful  I had this thought  Where there was this light  Above my bed  When I was in Israel  In a yeshiva  And I left it on  To read with  And I thought  I put this cup over it  To like black out the light 
[02:32:00]  But then it wouldn't stay on  So I just kept imagining  Like maybe I should just  Turn it off  No one will know  But I was like  Nah someone's gonna walk by  And see the light go off  I'm just getting in trouble  Wait wait  Can you explain that  I don't know what you mean  You're supposed to have the light on  The whole time  Yeah  Yeah it was hard to sleep  With the light right over your bed  But why does the light have to be on?  Yeah  Why does it have to be on?  Yeah why is the light on?  I wanted to read  Okay  So I couldn't turn it off  You can leave it on  Before Shabbat starts  Oh because of the  Not touching the  Yeah you can't use electricity  Oh you can't use electricity  So you wanted the light on to read 
[02:32:30]  But now that you turned the light on to read  And you can't turn it off  And I was gonna put like this  Like something like  Like that bullhorn  Like over the light  To cover it up  It just wouldn't stay on  I had a better plan  Than it worked out  Yeah  And I just had that thought  Of like maybe I should turn it off  But I realized like later  Like if you really believe  In a God that does not want you to do that  There's no thought of like  Maybe I should turn this off  Oh a little fucking slip  In the old faith right there  I compare it to like  If you believe in your father  That he's real  And he doesn't want  He doesn't want you to masturbate  If he's in the room 
[02:33:00]  You don't masturbate  Then he does want you  Oh okay  Yeah  Because you believe he exists  And you're like  There's no thought of you  It's like yeah maybe he's not real  I'm just gonna jerk off  Yeah yeah  So I just didn't  I just didn't believe  You just don't have it in you  Wow  But did it strike you as odd  And this is  With any religion  You could ask these questions  But it's just such  Nonsense  To not turn the light off  And in Catholicism  There's a million things  That are just utter nonsense  Oh yeah  Every religion  But that's just one  For Jews  That's just nonsense  It's because  It's a small spark  And building a fire 
[02:33:30]  Is one of the seven ways  You can work  So you're not supposed  To work on the Sabbath  It's so fucking retarded  Isn't that silly  It's so stupid  Yeah because electricity  Wasn't around you know  They had to like  Vote on it when it came out  Jesus  They got all the rabbis together  I'm like what is this  And say what should we do  Can we use this shit  And they're like no  Wow  But it's not work though  It's not work  Yeah  Working is differently  If you said to God  I'm gonna turn the light on  He's not gonna go  Well I'm glad you put  Eight hours in  Yeah  That's not how it works  Yeah it's also  You can't write 
[02:34:00]  Because scribe was a job  But you're like  I'm just writing  I'm not a scribe  Yeah I'm just doing  Sudoku  What about  That's not a problem  But it's illegal  But you can walk  Right  You can walk  What else can you do  Read  Wow  Play basketball  With your friends sometimes  Really  Even though that's a job though  Oh yeah  For a lot of people  NBA is a job  Yeah  Well they figure  No Jews  Yeah that's true  It's a job for  Let's be real  It's for the schmatzes 
[02:34:30]  People will just ignore logic  Ignore  It's just so  In religion  Ridiculous at some point  That drives me nuts  So you spoke  You spoke  What was it  Hebrew  Hebrew  You speak it fluently obviously  Yeah it's gone down a lot  Because I haven't spoken in a while  What is yeshiva  Like what do you do there  You study  Talmud and Torah  All day long  From 8am to 10pm  Terrible  For how long  Oh man  It was two years  Holy shit  Wait you had a  What  It's crazy  8am to 10pm  For two years  You'd have like an hour break 
[02:35:00]  For lunch  And mess around a little bit  And a little break for prayer  What about weekends  Yeah  You could go home for that  I went to my  My grandmother lived there  So I would go there  A lot  And then  Wait  And your parents  Put you in this  Yeah they sent me there  And paid for it  How old were you  18 to 20  Oh my god  Those are like  Yeah those are the key years  Those are great  Loved up in years  Just wasted them  Just wasted them  Oh no  Learning about the shit  That I'll never put  Into my real life  Wow 
[02:35:30]  How many people drop out  Um  Nobody really drops out  They're all in it  At least for a year  Because you're probably  Religious before you get there  Right  Yeah yeah  What happens after you  They have different ones  Like some of them  Like are ways  To like get people  That are like  Sort of not religious  And like bring them back  Uh huh  Um  What happens to you  After that  Back into the fold  You like  Sway away a little bit  Then you're a full Jew  After that  You're full shit  Some people go on  To become rabbis  Right  Isn't it more like  And maybe it's like  With any religious thing  Wow  But while you're there  Like you're probably 
[02:36:00]  More caught up  Or people get caught up  In the bonding  And the sense of community  Than actually what it is  You're studying  Yeah  So it seems like  What you're studying  Is more real  But you're just in love  With this idea  Of hanging out with these people  And being a part of this group  It was the first time  I was you know  A straight F student  In high school  But like uh  It was the first time  I succeeded  Like all I do  Is sit there  And people are like  Good job  And I was like  Oh that's like an A  Hey I'm great  How do you study  Religious stuff all day  Do you  How do you  I don't understand  What do you  Just read it  Open up a book  And just read it  With somebody  By yourself  And it's all just 
[02:36:30]  Like religious  Stuff  They just talk about it  So you'll have like a class  And then you'll have  Like your own study time  And no test  No test  They're just like  Learn it  Figure it out  What was the idea  Of fucking off there  Like when like  If people didn't want to study  What would they do  That was considered  Like oh I can't believe  We're doing this  I mean it probably  Yeah  If you take like an hour break  Instead of like a half hour break  For lunch or something  Oh you maniac  If you're going to town  And get a slice of pizza  And stuff  They're like why  What are you wasting your time for  You could be studying 
[02:37:00]  Yeah  You could be getting closer to God  Wow man  It was  Yeah what a waste  18 to 20  That's when I should have been fucking  Prime rodeo time  My friend  Prime rodeo time  Yeah  Oof  Wow  Oy vey  So did you have a huge sense of relief  When you turned your back on this whole thing  Well it was really  The community was the biggest thing  Losing your sense of community  Was really bad  It was like oh I'm not connected to anything  Yeah  Anymore  That was the hard part  Jesus  But the rest was just  It was way easier  I'm like let me 
[02:37:30]  Let me go to like  Taco Bell  See what that's all about  So you had brand new experiences  At like 20 years old  Mmhmm  Like what kind of stuff that  We all just took for granted  And did way before that  Uh  Knowing a black person  That's my  I never met one of those  Outside like school  Never met one of those  Really  Yeah  Finding out they were normal  Just regular people like you and me  Really  Were you taught that they weren't  Or you just didn't experience that  It was just  That's not in 
[02:38:00]  In the books by the way  I think I just found a  Religion for Anthony  I have to go there  Yeah  I'm going to get you a plane ticket  I have to figure that one out myself  There was no  I remember we could  We could uh  There's no black people in Israel  There's none  There's a couple GIs  In like Tel Aviv  But in Jerusalem  Wow  There's no blacks  So we would talk to our  Wow  We'd see our friends  Like way down the street  What's the airline for Israel?  El Al  El Al  Could you call El Al right now  Like a reservation please  I hate to tell you  But you wouldn't be welcome there  What do you think  They're open arms for you  To come in with you  You're drinking 
[02:38:30]  And you're loud talking  Yeah true  We would just drop N-bombs  Like we'd see each other  Like two blocks away  And be like  Hey you  I don't know if I can say this  On here  But I was like  N-hocs  Wow  Just knowing no one  Will be offended  It was really free  You were your Jewish friends?  Uh huh  Wow  That's what I yell  In my movie theater  In my house  Because I know I can  In a movie theater  That's about it  Oh and in my car  And my kitchen  And my pool  And every time  One comes on television 
[02:39:00]  Yes I know  So where  This was in Yeshiva  There's literally  You sleep  So you have to make  A decision  Before this starts  Whether you want  To read  Or  Couldn't you put  Fucking uh  Instead of covering the light  Couldn't you just get  Those like little  Eye patch things  And wear them  What  Like a horse  What are you talking about  When you're sleeping  Blinders  Like you know  Those like things  They give you on a plane  To sleep like an iPad  Oh yeah  Yeah I guess  I could have done that  If I had thought of that  I'd still be religious  It's a lot deeper than that though 
[02:39:30]  He was enraged  By the whole light thing  It just made me think  I was like  What is this  Why am I doing this  I'm doing it just cause  It's more than just  Not being able to  You know  It's a whole mess  Jimmy Dore had the best joke  About religion  That I know of  He was like  Asked everybody  Like what are you Catholic  Why are you Catholic  Like well my parents  Are Catholic  And he's like  Everybody I know  Wouldn't let their parents  Pick out a pair of pants  For them  You let them choose  Your God  Yeah  That is good  Yeah man  It's a lottery  Yeah  Are you born into  The right religion or not  Yeah and everyone 
[02:40:00]  Thinks they are  Cause you know  A lot of religions  That's it  To me it's our way  Or you're going to hell  If there's a just God  If there's a fair God  Right  And you were born Protestant  So you get to go to heaven  And I'm born Jewish  So I wasn't  That's fucking  Fuck you  Your God's a douche  Yeah fuck him  That's not fair  I guess because this just God  Would figure  Look this guy should know  And have faith in me  There's no way  Not this religion  That his parents  He should have broken off  From that  And friggin found out  About me  Strange  Yeah 
[02:40:30]  Really strange  And you'd think  A just God would be like  Well he put in the effort  Even though it's the wrong God  Eh might as well  Take him in  I do like the Jewish view  On non-Jews  Where they don't have to  Do any of the laws  They still got to go to heaven  That is pretty good  Yeah  But we're not as special  Right  There's no rape  No you still get to  No you're not as special  Not as special  Yeah  You get to go to heaven  But fuck  You can't rape  You can't kill  You can't eat live animals  Whoa  And I forgot the other four  Why do Jews look down at us 
[02:41:00]  Crazy  We're better than you I think  That's the overall attitude  It is right  Yeah  That's what it is  God you see it in New York  Especially  Yeah  They're like  You don't hang out  With those people  You don't talk to them  Yeah  They're not like us  But every religion  In a way  At least  I mean to me  Jews are more honest about it  Every religion  If you think you have  The inside tract on heaven  You think you're better  Than everybody else  And every religion  You think they have the inside  Fucking tract on heaven  So they openly laugh 
[02:41:30]  Like these idiots  They got the wrong religion  I'll tell you one thing  If a Jew broad  Starts getting a period  I'll fucking finish the job though  I'll fucking finish  I'll even go down on her  I don't care  Get some of that fucking  Blood beard  My friend had that  He was having sex with somebody  And she was like  She sobered up  And she was like  I don't want to do this anymore  And he stopped  And he goes  Can I please just come  Can I  She was like  Yeah  Quick nine strokes  How sad  Oh is that pathetic  We got David in Israel  I knew he was going to call today

[02:44:30]  Out of a crack house  Buckling her pants  All the rest  Oh fuck man  We said ass eating  Is for the young  Art  Yeah that's one of the things  We like to promote  You don't want to have  Had so much  It's coming out of it  Over the years  It's for the young  Where it's just weathered  I just started  Like a couple years ago  Prolapsing  Really  Yeah but then I had  Those phantom smells  Where you think you can  Like still  Like a day later  A little smell is okay man 
[02:45:00]  A little smell is okay  It's fucking  You gotta embrace that  You gotta get a good shave  In after you eat ass  Get rid of anything  That's catching  Get stuck on your  Fucking stubble  You like the smell huh  If it's clean  It can be disgusting  But if it's really bad  I don't like it  But if it's got like  Just a little  A little smell of ass  It can be very sexy  Not nameable  You don't mind at all  Right  It's a nice little ass smell  Dive right in  Come on  Let's rock  Exactly  Hey if it's the third quarter 
[02:45:30]  And you're down by six points  What do you say  Like no there's mud out there coach  I'm gonna stay on the bench  Of course you don't  Well this is different  I did  I got fucked by Rich Voss  That's actually  Isolate that  That's actually  Baby shit on my mustache  That's terrible  Yeah yeah  That's terrible  Ew  That's one of the worst things  I've ever seen  Why'd you do that  Well these guys set me up  Really bad  I was doing these like  How are you smiling  I was doing these  Impromptu contests  Where I'm like  Look if someone brings 
[02:46:00]  In a baby diaper  In the next hour  I'll do a mustache  But when the hour is over  No way  I'm not doing it  Yeah  And somehow these guys  Set me up behind the scenes  And Rich Voss was waiting  With a fucking baby diaper  We just shoved it on you  No I put it on myself  But here's the best part  I felt like I couldn't back out  I would look like a complete  And utter fucking pussy  Here's the best part of that  Opie has baby shit under his nose  And yet the wherewithal  To put on medical gloves  So as not to get doo-doo on his fingers 
[02:46:30]  While he's smearing it  Between his mouth and sinus  I never noticed that  That's the worst thing I've done  How bad about smell  It was horrendous  I did puke  That's terrible dude  I didn't have a full puke  But stuff was trying to get out  Of my fucking body  It was horrendous  And then you  Did you keep doing this  Like after you're sipping it  It was bad  It's when you still think  You can smell it  Like a day later  It was bad  It was horrendous  The first ass you ate  Obviously  How did it happen  Like you were eating her pussy  And she rolled over 
[02:47:00]  And said  It was the first girl  That I just hated  But I was like  So I didn't  I didn't like  Pretend  That we were gonna go out  She was like  We should hang out sometime  And I was like  No  I just wanna fuck you  Oh  And my friend gave me a line  That I used on her  When she was like  Take me out for a drink  I said  You can drink from  My cock  And eventually that worked  Like I didn't want  Anything else  But then we were doing it  And I just could not  Get a boner  It was nowhere near it  Why did she  Her breath smell  Did her pussy smell 
[02:47:30]  Was she not touching you right  She was real flat  And I don't know  Just sometimes  Once in a while  The chemistry wasn't there  Yeah  And so she was blowing me  And it was just  It was just there  Because she was like  Faced up a little  At an angle  And I was like  I don't know  Fuck it  Right  Let's try it  She seemed real smooth  And clean  Yeah  It was alright  And what happened  She was like  What have we got here  Did you get a rod  Did I  No  I did come  With a soft dick  In her mouth  Nothing more satisfying 
[02:48:00]  And humiliating  At the same time  Blurka  Blurka  Blurka  Just like  I'm into it  I guess  I don't know  I just checked my Twitter  Kevin from Connecticut  Wow  Jerusalem is a lot like Vermont  You ever have your ass eaten  Is that something you're into  No see  Now that's something  I will not tolerate  Yeah  I don't like that at all  Yeah  Live for it  Really  Live for it  I know what goes on  Is it  These guys have man asses though 
[02:48:30]  Like my ass is literally  It's like  It's like the fucking  The baby Jesus  My ass is immaculate  It's wonderful  I'm always up for getting my asshole  Do you like the actual feeling  Or do you just like the idea  Of someone eating your ass  Both  The feeling is great  I used to get a massage  From this one girl  And while she was massaging me  She would  She would kiss my ass cheeks  And I would push my ass back  And eventually  She started eating my ass  And jerking my dick off  Like a fucking  Like a donkey tail  Back through my legs 
[02:49:00]  While I was on my hands and knees  I  And then she would jerk it forward  And her back of her knuckles  Would hit my fucking  Fat appendix scar  But it felt so good  To have my ass eaten like that  But I'm  I look like a tuba player  Yeah  She really is  But I'm very clean  And if my ass is dirty  I wouldn't do it  But I know my ass is very clean  And I fucking love my ass eating man  Really?  Oh  Why?  What's the sensation?  It just feels good dude 
[02:49:30]  Like I had a massage therapist  Trying to fuck me with a strap on once  And I wish I could take it  But I can't  I just can't take a strap on  It hurts my asshole too much  Well  That's probably a good thing  No but it's probably fun  To have a fucking beautiful girl  Doing something so dirty to you  I mean I've seen that in shows  In TV and movies before  Where it's like  If it's supposed to be pleasurable  I guess  She was so hot  And she was rubbing it  Like I'm on my back  Yeah  And my legs were up  And she was just pushing this fucking  This fucking dick against my ass  And I'm looking at her beautiful body  And her tits  And she was so pretty 
[02:50:00]  And she so didn't look like  She should be doing something so dirty  Oh that's nice  And we lose this argument all the time  The phones will be lit with guys  That have had this done  But why does it have to look like a dick  Yeah  First of all  Yeah  Why can't it look like something else  Then maybe more guys would be open to the  What a Ford pickup truck  Well I don't know  But  They're going to start calling  They're going to start calling  They're going to say  I've had it done  And it's not gay  So why not make it look like something else  Then maybe other guys would be open to the experience  Is what I'm saying  Like what though 
[02:50:30]  I don't know  Just a straight rod  Just a  Something  Oh yeah maybe  I don't know  A pickle  But I'm guessing  Because women use it on each other  A lot of times too  So they don't have  They don't mind it looking like a dick  Yeah  Dude I bet they could sell a lot more  To straight people  If they made it look like something else  You don't want it to have like veiny balls on it  Veiny rubber balls  Why is that part of it  Wait a second  No one is going to  No one who wants to be fucked in the ass  Is going to go  You know what  If that looked like a lipstick  I'd take it  No one is thinking that  That's part of the fun of it  Is that it's completely despicable 
[02:51:00]  What you're doing  Is that it  The guys will call  And they will insist  It's not a gay act  You said this thing  To Steve Simone once  That he quoted all the time  Because he was all depressed  And you're like  Steve sometimes you just  You just gotta  You just gotta get fucked  By a black hooker  And he was like  Why does she have to be black  And you were like  Come on man  That was my response  Yeah  Come on man  Good response  You know the answer  So  I was pissed on by a black hooker  That's what it was  It wasn't fucked 
[02:51:30]  It was pissed on  My mistake  So was mom more open  Than your dad  When you left  Yeah she didn't grow up religious  So  She married into it  Yeah she like  Got more religious  Than my dad did  But my dad grew up in Israel  He's a holocaust survivor  So he was like  Oh wow yeah  He's  He's pretty hardcore  Into it then  He was a kid  When he was  How old was he  In the holocaust  Seven when it started  Twelve  By the end  Now was he in a camp  Or was he  He was in a ghetto  His dad was in a camp  Was liberated from  I think Birkenbeltson 
[02:52:00]  So he survived  How about his mom  Mom survived  That whole  Direct family  Survived  I don't know how  My grandmother was like  Well of course he survived  Well no the grandmother  I don't know  Fari would be here  No but I mean like  Well you've never seen  Back to the future  Yeah true  I ended up fucking my mom  But of course  I'm not my own father  They have to  Please don't listen to this mom  It's good  So they survived  They were in the ghetto  They never wanted to  Were there Jews  That they just kept in the ghetto 
[02:52:30]  And didn't put in a camp  It was like  It was like a processing plant  That IBM helped like  Process people  They designed  You know those old  Punch card things  Yeah  Yeah they  IBM helped the Nazis  Like make those  A lot of people  Helped those Nazis out  With a  It was a war machine  Why not  Machinery  So you guys don't like IBM  Goods and services  No I did a commercial  For IBM right before  That amazing racist stuff  Came out  There you go  And they were like  IBM shouldn't be  Hiring these racists  And I was like  IBM's got a long history  Don't worry about  What I'm doing  So they would 
[02:53:00]  How would they  The ghetto would be what  You just  They couldn't leave  Yeah you can't leave  You could sneak out  But that would like  You'd have to like  Seriously bribe a guard  To get out  And get bread or something  Put it at the other side  Of the wall there  Yeah  I did a podcast  My dad never talked about it  So then I got him  To talk about it  Like on a podcast  Just about those days  Oh wow  Fuck  You were getting your dad  On a podcast  Yeah  Wow  He never talked to me  About it growing up  It was just something  He just like  Didn't want to talk about  No shit  Doesn't sound like  A very pleasant thing  Yeah  And what did he say  On the podcast 
[02:53:30]  He just told you about it  Was he sad  Yeah but he had  Been over a little bit  He started volunteering  At the Holocaust Memorial  And then he realized  Like oh I should be  Talking about this  I shouldn't just be  Keeping it to myself  Yeah  Yeah it was sort of like  It was a long  I mean it was  60, 70 years ago  Yeah  So he was able  To process at this point  But he was talking  About how his grandmother  Used to  His mother used to  Like bribe people  To like pay bread  To people  In order for them  To teach  My father  And his sisters  And were there  Like dead people  In the streets 
[02:54:00]  And shit  People were dying  Left and right  If you caught a disease  From like malnutrition  You're done  Yeah  Was there any hospital  Or not at all  Nothing  Hospital  There might be a doctor  Like who was there also  Who could help you  But they couldn't  Give you anything  Wow  They would just be like  Here's what you gotta do  Try to eat some of this  Or try to stay off your feet  Because there was no way  To get medicine in  Disease usually kills  More people during wars  Than the actual  Like bullets and bombs  Really  Fucking amazing  Yeah  More people died  In like  I think even World War II  But more civilians  Died of diseases  Than actual bombing 
[02:54:30]  And Civil War  Same thing  In the Civil War  It was mostly diseases  That killed soldiers  Than them  Really  Yeah  Well infections right  Yeah  Infections  And then just  You know  These wacky  Fucking diseases  Just being cold  Yeah  Being freezing cold  That's what killed  The Nazis  Was Russia  They invaded too late  Yeah  They fucked that one up  They killed Napoleon too  Really  Yeah  Russia went to  It fucked Napoleon  And it fucked Hitler  Hitler didn't  Fucking remember that  That's their great wall  Yeah  There's like a two day window  Where you can invade Russia 
[02:55:00]  Other than that  If it's after July 4th weekend  You're fucking finished  That one doesn't play games  Yeah right  So your podcast too  You invited me to do it  I wasn't available to  Because I really  I actually really do want to do it  Where can people get it?  iTunes  Or my website  Ari the Great  It's just  It's called  Ari Shaffir's Skeptic Bank  I just take a topic  And like flesh it out  So we should feature an hour  On our channel  Yeah maybe  Get with E-Rock  After the show  If it's something you're into  Yeah that'd be great  Ari's gonna be at the Stress Factory  We know that much

Curse in front of her on purpose  She's like Ari  Come on please  Do they see your act?  Yeah my brother can handle it  My parents  No huh? 
[02:56:00]  They want to support me  It's just  Do your parents watch you?  Yeah but I was seven years in  Do they watch Jimmy?  Oh my god  Now they come to  Most of my bigger shows  Really?  Do your parents listen to this?  Huh?  Do your parents listen?  Yeah my mom  I mean aren't you embarrassed  At some point?  Used to  Yeah  Nah I grew up  We grew up goofing on shit like that all the time  Like I'd be at family dinners with my grandparents and aunts and uncles and my mom and shit  And cousins and just say the worst most heinous things and they'd all crack up laughing 
[02:56:30]  So  Really?  Yeah that's the kind of family we grew up in  It was really twisted  I just when they're there I get so self conscious  Sure  Oh yeah of course  You're really the black sheep of the family though  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  So what do you have in common with your  I saw my brother took over  He got a gambling addiction  And let me off the hook  Oh shit  Yeah I was like in the clear  Oh man  All I had to do was eat Big Macs  I didn't gamble away my tuition  Oh really man?  Did he gamble his tuition away?  For like two years  Oh shit  What was his poison? 
[02:57:00]  It was great  I don't know  I think poker I think  With blackjack too  Nah it can't be poker  What?  It can't really be  It's just chasing  There's a fuckload of mine in poker  Yeah  The problem with gambling  It's not like alcohol  Where it's like  There can  You can win  You know?  You can't drink yourself into a good place  That's pretty fucking true  You can win  Yeah  So how much money did he lose  And how much was tuition a year?  It was law school  Georgetown Law  Oh wow  Oh boy  Two years  Wasn't going to school  Two years  Your dad's gotta be more pissed at him than you 
[02:57:30]  It was a bad situation  Wait they didn't know  That he wasn't going to school for two years?  Nope  Then it all came out  What was he doing with WorkWise?  Wow  I don't really know how  Me and him were really good liars  Oh my god  Like we're really good  So like he was coming out  You know how you do that summer associateship  After like second year of law school  They give you like a high paying summer job  How would we know that?  Okay yeah  Look at us  Look at us  Look at us  Here's what you were to say 
[02:58:00]  Sam's the nicest looking one  I can  You were to say  You know how when you go for your GED  The tent  Well yes we know  I wouldn't even know that  I can tell you what iron it hit from 160 yards out  With a little wind in your face  But it was a week  Yeah  Alright  It was a week out  And he was like  Yeah I'm coming to LA to get a job  So help me like look for an apartment  Yeah  And there was no job  Like  There was no diploma  There was never  Oh wow  What was he going to do?  Just go back sneakily and do it  When no one was looking?  I got a question  Yeah  The tuition  How did he turn that into actual money?  I think 
[02:58:30]  Because my parents used to just write the check  To the college  Yeah I think  How did he turn that?  My aunt and uncle gave him like a bunch for  She married rich  So I think she gave him money for a year  Right  And then I don't  I think  I don't know if you managed to take it out  How did he roll that shit over?  Nice  How much do you think you lost?  How much is tuition in Georgetown?  I think 20 grand a year  Did he eventually get his degree?  I think 20 grand a year is low  Yeah  But yeah  That might be low  Might have been like 30  I think that's very low  I'm guessing that  You're right 
[02:59:00]  Is he a lawyer now?  Yeah he says he is  But at some point it was like  Man I don't  Anything you say at some point  Is like  I don't know  You don't believe  Was he a compulsive liar?  Well it's just  He had to cover up all this stuff  He would just keep  Once you keep lying  Then you just don't ever know  The snowball  Yeah  And then when those people  They always say like  Dude I told you  I'm going tomorrow  And you're like  Well I don't  You've told me a lot of things  Yeah  I don't know  Do you call him online?  No I try to never talk to him about it  And try to be cool  Just like we'll talk about sports and stuff  Oh wow  It's like you know  Fix your life 
[02:59:30]  How old is he?  I don't want to barrage you  He's now like 36  Oh wow  So you don't even know  If he's really a lawyer  I don't know where he lives  You don't know where he lives?  He had a return address of LA for a while  He just kind of pulled away I think  Out of embarrassment  Oh wow  So you don't see him much?  Mm-mm  Once every year or two  He lived in Zurich for a while  He has all these loans and like tax debt in America  So he can't really  He really fucked up  I might still be gambling  God gambling can fucking really fuck your life 
[03:00:00]  Yeah  Gambling has ruined people  It's not like credit card debt  Where you can like  You have to have the money ahead of time  And figure out a way to get it  Yeah  To gamble?  Yeah  Yeah  I watched the bad lieutenant scenes  Again on the fucking thing  When Strawberry  Oh my god  That scene  Like of him knowing what he's lost  Yeah  In the car  Where he's just screaming about Daryl's strawberry  Yeah  And he's like  Oh  Like this fucking powerful police lieutenant  Just crying over the fact  That he's going to be murdered  For losing all this money 
[03:00:30]  Yeah  So fucking intense man  It's just the bottom drops out  I've lost too much money before  When I was little  When I was like 15  You know when he was 30 bucks  And you're like  Damn it  That was everything I had  Yeah  I've gambled  I've lost a lot of money  I've made a lot of money  But I don't go  It's a great opening line  By the way  For your biography  Yeah  I've lost a lot of money  I've made a lot of money  Shut up Anthony  But I'm not one that goes  To the casinos 
[03:01:00]  Unless like  There's something going on  Right  Like you know  Jimmy's doing a show  At a casino  I'll go down to Atlantic City  And like do that  And then I'll fucking gamble  Like I'm a motherfucker  You'll go nuts  Yeah  But I don't just go to a casino  Like I had the last  When's the last casino  I guess we were in  Vegas  Vegas yeah  Yeah we went to Vegas  For the UFC thing  And  I didn't even really gamble  That much  I think UFC's have cured me  Of like the need  To go to casinos  Yeah  It's just so much  So often  And those people 
[03:01:30]  Are just the worst people  The worst fucking place  Is the  Casino  Yeah  Just Vegas in general  It's all fat people  With tank tops  From Ohio  It's just gross  I don't want to be around  Those people at all  Bing bing bing bing bing  Bing bing bing bing  Bing bing bing bing bing  Bing bing bing bing bing  Stop  Non-stop  God  Smoking  And what do you do  Like we went out  To eat with Rogan  It was just a fun hang  And it was like  I had no desire  To go and do anything  Fucked up after that  Yeah  There was once  Probably one of the  Funnest times I've had 
[03:02:00]  A UFC weekend  Is it was at the  Pearl  At the Palms  Yeah  And they had that  Comedy club  Court McCown's room  And Renizzisi was there  And Don Marrera was in town  And Doug Benson was in town  So they were doing  Guest spots  And we did  And then we all went  To like one of those  Small bars  Not a club  Just one of those  Right right  In the lobby bars  And talked for like  Two hours  It was so much fun  Isn't it great  Just laughing  And fucking drinking  Yeah  Just talking  That's like  That's my ideal  I love  Yeah  I don't need  I don't like a big  Fucking noisy  Place with  Bam  Bam  Bam  Bam  Bam  Bam  I like a good 
[03:02:30]  Fucking gin mill  With a game  On the TV  Or something  And just  Sit there  Drinking beers  Yeah  I'm a regular  Long Island  White trashy  Kind of guy  I like that shit  Darkboard  I was in Queens  And I was  I had going  What was his name  Of course  Well you know how it is  When you go out to see a prostitute  But they apparently fall asleep  And don't answer the call  And you get there  So you're riding around Queens 
[03:03:00]  And I'm just looking at all these  Little bars  And I'm driving around  I'm going back home  And there's like a row of houses  And there was a little bar  Wedged into them  It was like such  The proverbial hole in the wall  And like I wonder what it's like  In that place  Like what happens  All the people that go in there  Regularly  Locals  Yeah  Regulars  I didn't go of course  But it just seemed like  This place of real like  Fucking texture  And real interesting  I kind of wanted to go in  Yeah  That's good for a sober alcoholic  Yeah  When I go in 
[03:03:30]  Yeah I want to slow pop  With Joe Rogan  And go into a bar in Queens  When my fucking hooker cancels  I've always been able to  I've always been able to walk into  A bar like that  And just kind of  After a couple of beers  Kind of fit into a conversation  Really?  That's just going on  Oh I can  I'm so self-conscious  Yeah one of those things  Are you really?  I couldn't do that  No way  I used to like that too  If somebody's talking about  Something that's kind of  Gotta pick the right bar though  Something  Yeah it's got to  Local Irish bars  Talking about sports  Or guns I bet 
[03:04:00]  Gotta be careful  Well sometimes  It all depends on what  They're talking about  I won't try to start up  A conversation  But if I could  Fit a joke in or something  That people are talking about  And then get involved  Especially if there's like  Girls over there  Yeah  Doing that thing  56 grand a year Ari  What is that?  The Georgetown  That's how much Georgetown is?  Yeah it's coming in a few times  How many years ago was this?  How many years ago?  10 years?  7, 8, 9  I was thinking 50 a year  50 a year  So you're talking probably 100 G's  Yeah  That's a lot of money  On that alone  Who knows what else 
[03:04:30]  That is a lot of fucking money  Yeah  It got to the point  My parents were like  You need to check your credit  Just to make sure  Make sure there's no  Credit card stuff  That's in your name  There wasn't?  There wasn't  Yeah  So your parents are  And your sister does what?  And your other brother does what?  That's the only brother  My little sister teaches  Like religious tourist school  And my older sister does nothing  Nothing  But it is like every other family  Like you look at this religious thing  Like oh very ultra religious  But it's like  Alright the parents 
[03:05:00]  You know  The one son's kind of doing  What they're not too thrilled with  The other one's a fucked up gambler  The religious girl they like  And the other one does  Sounds like an average family  It really does  With the same  At some point you realize  In your life  Like yeah  My life is not unique  You know what I mean  I'm not special  The story's been told before  I said the same thing  About my act  I didn't mean  By the way  I didn't mean to fire out  The word act  Like it's 1920  I was gonna laugh  When I said it  Woody Allen  Yeah  My act  I didn't mean to  Over enunciate the word act 
[03:05:30]  Yuck  Ari's gonna have an act  At the stress factor  I wanna make sure  You sell some tickets for Ari  Cause you're giving us  A great hour  Ari's a very funny stand up too  Absolutely  It's so nice now  With the podcast  With like Rogan's podcast  And my own a little bit  But like to be able  To headline now  Like clubs are just  Letting me in  And they're like  After all these years  You draw  You haven't been on TV  And you're like  Just watch  Don't worry about it  Yeah  You'll still take it  They all know you're  From Joe's thing  Yeah and this will help 
[03:06:00]  A shit ton too  That Rogan podcast is huge  Holy fuck  It's fucking massive  Oh yeah  Holy fuck  Just from the  I tell people  Just from the fucking  Stream alone  Like before they put  Up in the podcast  When you're live streaming  Hundreds of tweets  Oh yeah  You go out of there  You leave  First of all it's three hours  Yeah  But you leave there  And you have to let  You get your at replies  And you're like  Fuck  This is gonna be a lot  To catch up  Have you guys done it  No I haven't  Really  We just gotta get  Out to LA  Yeah  I think you'd enjoy it  It's a very very fun  Him and Red Band  It's a very very mellow  Set up at the ice house 
[03:06:30]  Right  They do it there a lot  In Pasadena  Is it Pasadena  That's Pasadena  Yeah  He does one in his place  And it's just a fucking  It's hot  And Rogan is wearing  A fucking shirt  That's way too tight  It's probably an XL  But it just wraps around  This fucking man's body  And he's fucking  Raging out  He's hulking  Yeah he really is hulking  And he's stoned  Out of his fucking head  But just  With that laugh  Of his  We smoke so much  Sometimes that we just  Like stare at each other  For a while  And we're like  Oh we gotta say something  How's Diaz doing 
[03:07:00]  Diaz doing great  He's another one  We had him on once  I like Diaz  I haven't seen Joey  In years man  We had Joey on  Gotta get him back  Yeah he's reinvigorated too  Yeah  People come to see him  It's one of those things too  Where there's a lot of comics  Well you know this  From like  From like the seller and stuff  Who just can't get into  Like major clubs  Yeah  But are killers  And Diaz is one of those guys  And then he gets a shot  And people are like  Jesus  Oh  He's an animal  Yeah you've been doing this  For a long time  He tells a good story  He tells a really good story  Holy fuck 
[03:07:30]  Yeah there's a lot of comedians  That don't get their due  Like and I guess  That's the same with any job  Radio guys or actors  But a lot of guys  That just  No not radio guys  You think  You think  Trust me no  Oh you think  All the good ones are known  Oh yeah  Absolutely  Alright maybe just actors  Absolutely  I'm standing by that one  That was a bad example  Fuck those guys  Really all the ones  That aren't known  Are shitty  I don't know  There might be someone out there  I'll say this  It's a lot tougher  To get any traction  Than radio now  So there might be 
[03:08:00]  Some good guys out there  You guys had problems  For a while didn't you  Getting like  Traction  Yeah or was it right away  Were you like syndicated  Pretty much right away  Oh that's good  Yeah  Yeah we came out of  The whole Boston thing  With a reputation  So  But we  Yeah  We quickly got a reputation  Up there too  And then  Within a year  We were on a rocket ship  I'm surprised at how many  Radio guys  When I go into radio  Listen to you guys  Yeah we hear that a lot  Well I don't  I didn't know these guys  In Boston  And then they went to New York  And eventually  They were only out in New York  And then just something 
[03:08:30]  Magical happened  And then syndication  I don't know  There was a magical thing  Jimmy wants  I want to know  That he joined the program  And then everything  Seemed to happen  Oh I was even thinking of that  Oh  Something happened  To the success  You know what  I think that's what  I think that's what  Jimmy's referring to  It's funny you say that  I wasn't tying it into that  I'm not really sure though  No I stepped in at the right time  The beautiful thing  Is when a rocket ship  Is taking off  And you just jump in the door  And then you can take credit for it  But your syndication 
[03:09:00]  Was fucking  I remember  People screaming about it  It was great  It was fucking great  But you know what  It was great in certain markets  But then you go to other markets  And nobody knew  Here  That's weird  Yeah  Everybody knows  In Canada  People in fucking Montreal  Walking up to me  I love the show  Love the show  It's weird to be in Canada  And have people  Listening to the radio show  Yeah how do you have one market  That was fucking outstanding  We're killing  And then another market  You just can't get any traction  Ratings are coming out  And you're just  You're sweating  And nervous about 
[03:09:30]  Ratings  We had to worry about  Ratings  Sucked  We had to worry about  Ratings coming out  Every day  We're in so many markets  That  Were they telling you  To change up  To be better in certain markets  No because the ones  That were working  They just knew  You know  It just might not happen  For that part of the country  Sometimes it's just a question  Of like launching  At the right time  Or with the right  Yeah  They said ABBA  Released their first single  Didn't hit in America  And they got a new manager  Like two years later  And said we're going to  Release that single again  I think that can catch on  And then it was like 
[03:10:00]  That single was  Dancing Queen  What song was it?  I don't know  It might have been  One of their huge hits  I'm sure  What else do they have  Besides Dancing Queen?  Oh my god  Stop it Jimmy  Have you been to Broadway?  Mamma Mia  Have you been there?  Is that ABBA shit?  Mamma Mia  That fucking dumb play  There's nothing  I'd rather see less  Money Money  Yeah  How does Money Money go?  Waterloo was huge  I don't know Waterloo  You know Waterloo  No I don't  Give us some Waterloo  We rock  Waterloo  Hit me with some Waterloo 
[03:10:30]  That's the first time  That's ever been staged  Oh yeah  Oh the live version  He tried to hide it  Did you see that?  Yeah  Oh  Oh yeah  See  Who doesn't love Alpha?  Come on  Why won't they reunite?  Somebody fuck somebody's wife  Or something  What's this weird story? 
[03:11:00]  There's a lot of money  On the table  I was going to say  If there's millions involved  You get over that shit  Fuck yeah  Are you kidding me?  Dude but what about  Why do you put yourself at risk?  There's so many people you can fuck  Yeah  Yeah really  There's three band members wives  You have to stay away from  That's it  That's all you gotta do  That's all  You can fuck their daughters  You can get over it  Just not their wives  The list of  Yeah  Three people  It's like Kristen Stewart  And Robert Pattinson  So she cheated on them  And apparently went on for a while  With whom?  The director of a fucking 
[03:11:30]  That Snow White movie  Yeah but she's into them too  So it was obvious  That guy's a bad lay  Maybe  She's a bad fucking lay  She's been with him for four years  And she's also really young  Yeah she's also just hitting her stride  And she's like  This is boring  Yeah but they're the same age  Weren't they?  Well I don't know  They were around the same age  That Snow White movie  Made me angry  But that guy  He goes  Get your fucking stuff  Out of my place  But the amount  You all showed up the next day  The amount of money  Oh yeah  In these Twilight movies  It's like  Just don't get caught cheating 
[03:12:00]  Because they do the movies together  Weren't they done with that shit  Oh maybe they were  They were done for now  And now that's what it was  Now she's just out  Taking dick everywhere  I'm glad when these Hollywood  Fuck dicks got fucked over  Like everybody else does  In their life  Good fuck him  And you know  His money or looks  Didn't fucking help him  Good  Homey  Good looking  I'm a little bitter  Good looking guy  With probably no game  Yeah  No game  Can't get the job done  He's got girls  Fucking screeching over him  All the time  Right  And he fucking  Can't lay it to his chick  Ah  You know what 
[03:12:30]  Talk about rebound pussy  He  Oh yeah  Will do a lot  Because she'll  She'll go out and date  Because women don't go out  And act like fucking  Complete  Fucking whores  Whores yeah  He'll just go out  And put his dick  In everything now  Everything that he could have  For all these  These dumb Twilight fans  Head in the pillow crying  Also she's a six  No I think she's really cute  I wouldn't mind  I'm with Ari  No way  She's not as hot as this  She's just there  She's alright  Get a picture of her  She kind of  She kind of has a manly thing 
[03:13:00]  Going a little bit  How she moves  That preview for that  Snow White movie  Where they're like  Who's the fairest of them all  And I was like  Oh I was waiting  I didn't know who was in it  So I'm like  Who's Holly  We're going to pick  As the hottest woman  In the world  And when it was her  I was like  Come on  That is not that hot  Let me say  It's hot  It's hot though  She got that  Kind of gothy  It's how she moves  It's not a skanky  Slutty look  It's how she moves  And presents herself  Where it knocks down  Her number a little bit  Here's the problem  You pass her on the street  And not notice her  Her tiny facial features  In the middle of a giant face  Yeah  It looks like 
[03:13:30]  Photoshop has made  Like there she looks  Really good  She looks really good  She's very pretty  How long does she  She presents herself  I don't know  I'm going to get 26  I think she's 32  I wouldn't mind  Licking her lips  Making vampire sounds  Yeah  Describe that  Whoa  What's that?  Oh she is 22  Oh wow  And how old is Robert Pattinson?  She's 22 now  Yeah  So she probably hasn't dated a whole lot  So she's out just  You know  She's four years with this guy  And she's going to marry him  Oh since she was 18 
[03:14:00]  Yeah  He's 26  So he's out and fucking  And this guy was an older man  This director is an older man  And again  It's like fucking  Ashton Kutcher  All of her fans  And his fans  Are young  So she probably wanted to go out  And experience an older man  Because none of her fans are older  So that director  Fucking probably just  You know  Guided her  Gave her career guidance  That's all I get  Is girls  Girls that want  Like someone older  Who knows  Yeah  Something  That's it  Probably has a tiny penis  You think?
