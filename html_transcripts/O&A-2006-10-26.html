<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a humorous, fictional news report about a rage-inducing virus, immediately transitioning into a heated discussion about a video showing Opie stomping on a homeless man's cake.  Listener feedback was overwhelmingly negative, labeling Opie's actions as "sick," "horrible," and "immature." Opie defended himself, claiming the cake was expired and that the incident ultimately benefited the homeless man due to subsequent donations.  The hosts debated the video's viral spread and the polarized reactions on message boards and YouTube, noting numerous death threats against Opie.  This led to a discussion about human nature and the tendency to "throw money at the problem" of homelessness.

The show then bounced between several topics: the recurring "I'm Paul R. Nelson" segment; upcoming appearances by Jim Belushi (who was later a guest in the studio) and John Mayer (who called in from Dubai); a discussion about a principal banning girls' superhero costumes; Black Sabbath's reformation with Dio; and the controversy surrounding their Halloween show tickets.  A significant portion of the broadcast revisited the cake-stomping video, playing audio clips and incorporating listener calls, both supportive and critical.  The hosts also promoted their "Homeless Shopping Spree" event and the annual eggnog drinking contest, which would be held publicly for the first time.  They also discussed their controversial "Feels for Meals" segment, repeatedly rejected by legal teams.  The show featured a series of highly offensive political ads, specifically targeting Congressman Ron Kind, and listener-created ads attacking Opie and Anthony.

The Madonna segment followed, heavily criticizing her adoption of a child from Malawi, questioning her motives and using disparaging and offensive language towards her and her parenting choices.  The conversation extended to other celebrities' African charitable work, suggesting self-promotion as a primary motive.  This segment also involved mocking politically charged ads for Paul R. Nelson, which employed emotionally manipulative tactics, including imagery of 9/11 and a young girl discussing partial-birth abortion, alongside aggressive and offensive rhetoric targeting Ron Kind.

Jim Belushi's in-studio appearance involved discussions of his career ("According to Jim," "Lucky Louie"), a story about a con artist cousin, airplane smoking anecdotes, his late brother John, and the challenges of his independent career.  John Mayer's call from Dubai included playful teasing about Jessica Simpson, discussion of his foray into stand-up comedy (including racial and relationship-themed material), his CD's success, and upcoming gigs.

Sharon Osbourne was also a guest.  The conversation focused on her autobiography, her relationship with Ozzy Osbourne, their reality TV show, and her difficult relationship with her father, Don Arden.  Jim Norton recounted a nervous encounter with Ozzy and Sharon, highlighting Ozzy's cursing.  Norton's intense fandom of Black Sabbath and Ozzy was also a prominent topic, including a detailed story about obtaining a photo with the band.  The segment also addressed the negative press surrounding Ozzy.

Another significant portion of the show included tangents about a blizzard warning (deemed an overreaction by callers), a disruptive soup-tasting segment, the controversial "Fatty Pig Fatty Contest" (involving guessing contestants' weights), and a phone call with Jerry Springer following his elimination from a dancing competition show.  Studio worker Kenny frequently interrupted, a subpar smoothie was criticized, a poorly made Paul Stanley doll was evaluated, and numerous profane calls were received.  A contestant's weight was guessed and revealed on a scale. Dov Davidoff called in, discussing his career and anecdotes, including meetings with Mark Wahlberg and Chaz Palminteri and experiences with swingers clubs.

The final segment involved interviews with studio callers, including a line cook, DJ, print shop owner, and movie producer.  One caller, Bob, was repeatedly subjected to crude sexual comments.  The conversation shifted to PalTalk, discussing explicit sexual activities and the sharing of sexually explicit images.  Sam, a caller, admitted to masturbating in a public PalTalk chatroom, leading to further discussion and humiliation.  The segment included more discussion of negative political ads and listener-submitted parodies, using crude and offensive language throughout, featuring frequent sexual references. The show concluded with a prolonged comedic bit centered around "Paul R. Nelson" and promotion of various shows and events.  A "Daily Dump Report" mentioned segments deemed unsuitable for broadcast, including a comedian's abortion description and a homophobic slur.  The "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest and Madonna's adoption were also revisited throughout the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  The infection was everywhere. It was in the street outside. It was coming through your windows. It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease, spills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours? It infects, replicates, and kills this fast? These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct. I wish to God they weren't. 
[00:00:30]  It's that one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  Such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pussules. There's nothing you can do about it.  God Almighty.  We need to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right.  We're coming out.  Here we go.  I'm a boredom. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty like me.  James Norton.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[00:01:30]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Are you?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Hey, who is that guy?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  That's probably how he introduced himself to his wife.  Oh, what's your name?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Would you like a beverage?  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[00:02:00]  And I paid for this smear.  Ah, good morning.  Good morning.  What's up, Chicago?  We're watching you.  We're watching you, Chicago.  This is the O.P. and Anthony show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America. 
[00:02:30]  Spreading quite nicely lately, by the way.  We should acknowledge that.  Exactly.  Want to say hi to F.U. on instant feedback.  Location, your mom.  Some people are having a problem with the cake-stomping video.  Oh, boy.  Some people are having a problem with the cake-stomping video.  All right.  Now I have an issue because it's two minutes. 
[00:03:00]  Two minutes and you're already obsessing over the goddamn instant feedback.  I will personally break the screen.  I will personally now break the screen.  I want to go back and see how this kind of got to where O.P. got access full-time to the instant feedbacks.  No, I always...  It used to be, could you print them out for me?  No, no, no.  And people would shelter you from some of these.  I've always had it in front of me.  And then I noticed that we weren't acknowledging the instant feedback as much.  So then I started to read it a little more. 
[00:03:30]  That's all.  Don't worry, dude.  It'll go away.  You promise?  Yeah, man.  You go on the message boards.  You read what is being said as well.  Not during the show.  I only read the positive stuff, guys.  I have a positive filter on my computer.  That's what we need.  A positive filter.  Honestly, everyone...  Almond filter.  Honestly, everyone is talking about the cake stomping video.  So this is something that we got to talk about for another minute or two.  Yeah.  And we'll move on to other things. 
[00:04:00]  But F you from your mom, because when you're sending instant feedback, you have to have  a name and a location.  So this guy's name is F you.  Yeah.  And his location is from your mom, assuming my mom.  Are we in that market?  Your mom?  What market number is that?  I know my mom had, what, six kids.  So, you know, she might do good in the demo.  But the message on the instant feedback.  Just saw your video where you jump. 
[00:04:30]  He spells jump, J-A-M-P, by the way.  Just saw your video where you jump on that homeless guy's cake and you're effing sick.  Who the F would laugh at that?  That's just horrible.  You sick bastard.  It's immature, inconsiderate.  How would you like it if you had no food all day, you F?  Hmm.  He should jump off a bridge.  And then you got Serena from Florida. 
[00:05:00]  Cake stop.  Opie, I guess you could do whatever you want and just toss some money at it to make it all  better.  Make it go away.  You surely are a much better human than the man who offered you cake since you have money  to toss around on the sidewalk.  Easy come.  Ass.  Easy go.  He had with it.  He had...  I suck.  And he went with it.  That's right.  Break it up with a car crash.  He had with it.  He had with it. 
[00:05:30]  What a tool.  Oh, you're a good boy.  I suck.  Well, this is what we'll say today.  The cake stomping video is now up on YouTube.  It's getting viewed like crazy.  Judge for yourself.  Judge for yourself.  You can also find it on opianthony.com.  We jump on cakes.  You decide.  That's right.  Fair and balanced.  There's two versions on opianthony.com.  One where you have to wait about 10 minutes for it to load into your computer, and the  other where you just click and it plays immediately.  So you decide which one you want to click on.  Maybe you just got time waiting for a train. 
[00:06:00]  Whatever.  And if you want to have fun, you might as well read some of the comments because it's pretty  much split right down the middle.  50-50.  Where it counts.  A lot of people understand what this show's about, and a lot of people want to see me dead.  I'm cake-soddick.  Opie's cake-soddick.  No real gray area.  It's either black or it's white.  And Opie's a bum, so I'm T. Carvel. 
[00:06:30]  And I can explain it all the way, and I've decided this morning not to.  I get frustrated by some of the comments because I'm like, man, just use your brain and figure  it all out.  The pieces are all there.  You can figure out the puzzle by just using your own brain.  And I desperately, I really want to just explain myself right now, but I won't.  But I won't.  That's what I do now.  But I won't.  There's no explanation.  That video's hysterical.  I earned that cake. 
[00:07:00]  I earned that cake.  Watch it.  No, I earned that.  I think I earn a cake.  Exactly.  You don't go out and work.  And then rent time comes, and you hand your landlord a cake.  Yeah.  What is this?  Little house on the prairie?  We'll hang for it with lumber.  We earned those last chickens.  Yeah.  We had a long, laugh-free morning.  We earned them.  I earned that chuckle.  It's becoming a thing, though, on all the message boards and stuff. 
[00:07:30]  And then somebody did some investigation, I guess, after we left.  Oh, and they realized that the cake, the expiration date, was like a week ago.  Oh, it was.  So, obviously, and they also figured out it was a Starbucks cake.  And then someone from Starbucks that is a fan of the show said, yeah, what we do is when  the cakes expire, we kind of leave them in a way where the homeless will pick them up  and have some free food.  So, if earning the cake means that you saw it at the top of the dumpster, all right. 
[00:08:00]  He got to it before another homeless guy, so he earned it.  Right.  It's like a race to the dumpster.  Right.  I won.  Treat yourselves.  Treat yourselves to my garbage cake.  God, no.  I earned that.  Why?  I'll admit the one that really frustrated me.  Somebody said that, like, I crossed the line because I took food from another human being.  He's not a human being, of course.  Isn't that your point?  No?  No.  I went the wrong way? 
[00:08:30]  It's a stale cake.  And because of that stale cake, ah, the guy made a lot of money.  He made a lot of money.  It's in the video.  You see, like, all the people that did the walk with us the other day, they were so horrified.  Everyone was just throwing money like this.  Just make it go away.  Make it better.  Make it better.  Make it better.  Make me feel better about myself.  Right.  Throw money.  That girl's right, or whoever it was that wrote that.  You throw money at it.  We all do that, though, you know?  But that's a problem.  Like, usually it's a bad thing.  It's like, oh, you just throw money at the problem and it goes away. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  With homeless people?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  You know what the homeless need, you jackass?  Money.  Right.  So you throw money at them.  What are you supposed to do, throw counseling at them?  So that's why I get frustrated that people don't use their own brains.  It's like, okay, you're telling me that I took food away from a homeless guy.  First of all, you ever see what the homeless people eat?  All you have to do is walk around Manhattan for an hour.  You'll see old ladies digging into garbage pails right in front of you, like eating, you  know, half a freaking sandwich from Burger King. 
[00:09:30]  They'll eat a baby foot if you leave a stroller there long enough.  Right.  So first of all.  Come back and baby's feet are gone.  Not that this is going to help my.  All this guy's burping.  It's not going to help my cause, but I guarantee he ate the cake because it was still wrapped.  Secondly, if I'm taking food away from the guy, what about all the money he received  because of my horrific act?  Wouldn't that sustain him a little longer than a stale cake from Starbucks?  Sounds like you're reacting to a political ad.  Oh, yeah.  Negative political ad that was made against you. 
[00:10:00]  And then the little doggy company, Sirius Satellite Radio.  Woof.  It was brought to my attention that they decided to jump on this.  What?  Oh, yeah.  They jumped on the cake?  Well, no, they're commenting about how awful it was.  Like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of posts on their message boards.  Oh, stop it.  Good.  Let them talk about it.  Good.  And then the Stern fans jumping on the pile.  Well, you know, and just having a ball as far as the comments go on YouTube.  Can't give any credence toward them, that's for sure.  So the thing has a life of its own at this point. 
[00:10:30]  I just want to acknowledge it.  They're living in a world where Michael J. Fox is steady as a rock.  What you were doing before the show was really funny, by the way.  He could get help if he just...  Yeah.  Michael, get in the DeLorean.  We'll take you back to where you didn't shake.  Nuts on the door.  Biff Limbaugh getting all upset with him.  Yeah.  He didn't really shake. 
[00:11:00]  Michael needs to go back to the future.  Doc could help him.  Hopping the DeLorean.  88 miles an hour.  He pops out.  He could actually go back.  And then the back in time version, go forward.  Yeah.  And make fun of himself also.  Yeah.  And have fun like everyone else.  Look at me shaking.  But why only 88 miles an hour?  I would think you would have to go a lot faster. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Why did they decide on 88?  Does anyone remember from the movie?  I don't know, Doc.  Just that was how fast the DeLorean had to go.  88.  In order for the flux capacitor to start doing its flux thing.  Right.  And it needed how many gigawatts?  I don't know.  One point, what?  Ah, yeah.  Anthony goes 88 just backing out of his driveway in his new...  What happened?  In his new sports car.  Let's say hi to Andrew in California.  Andrew, what's up?  Dude, I'm getting tired of these douches. 
[00:12:00]  Calling out.  Dude, I've got to admit, that was the most awful thing I've ever heard on radio.  But it was funny.  And these douchebags are boo-hoo.  Shut up.  If you don't like it, turn your radio off.  That's right, girl voice.  Thank you for the support.  Thank you.  Go watch the view, you simpletons.  Yeah, yeah.  Sounds like me talking to Shawnee Smith. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  With his voices up five octaves, you faggot.  And I can't explain myself, but I don't want to lie bather.  All right.  Chris in Binghamton, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Last time caller, man.  Love you.  Love you guys more than anything.  Thank you, Chris.  I just want to tell you, Opie, you know what?  That was the best thing you could have done for that guy because he would have never got  as much money as he probably did after you did that for so many people.  You know what I'm saying?  He's been a part of our show now for, I don't know, two or three months at least. 
[00:13:00]  That guy has made a lot of money off this show.  A lot of money.  He can handle one lousy cake stomping.  Trust me.  Oh, exactly.  That's what I'm saying.  You did that guy a favor because you know how many people after that probably went by  him thinking they're feeling bad?  No.  I know.  I knew he was.  No.  No.  I earned that.  I earned that.  Ask that, man. 
[00:13:30]  The answer is Ipswich Clams.  It does say a lot about human nature, though, because in the video you do see money just  flying.  I threw some.  Jimmy circled back to give the guy money.  I know listeners were throwing money.  You can see, I think it's Danny because you don't see his face, just picking up dollar  bills at the end of the video.  It was just instant that the money started flying at the end of the vid.  So consciences would feel better. 
[00:14:00]  Exactly.  You've got to find a positive.  If you have lemons, you've got to make a lemon meringue pie.  Stomp on it.  Anyway, well, you know what?  Why don't we play the audio one last time?  One last time.  And then you can check out the video for yourself on YouTube or opiananthony.com.  Read the comments because they're just very, very entertaining.  Very entertaining.  Oh, yeah.  So Opie smashes Andrew's cake.  Yes.  Oh, listen, listen for Andrew in this one. 
[00:14:30]  Try that.  What did he say?  Treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  Guys.  Guys, treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  As he hands over the cake.  Guys.  Hey, pals.  My buddies.  All right.  Treat yourself.  Listen.  I want people to hear.  Listen closely to, first of all, Jimmy really enjoying it.  You're not innocent in this, buddy.  Nice tactic, Opie.  I howled.  Oh, and you too.  I mean, oh, okay. 
[00:15:00]  Horrible tactic.  Pointing fingers at other people trying to get the guilt off of you.  I say you listen to this clip and listen to Jimmy and Anthony laughing their asses off.  They are guilty too.  We had to flee the situation.  Yeah.  We fled the situation.  Well, I silently tried to will him into holding his cake, but it just came out as a, no.  The second you hear Opie say, put it on the ground or put it down, Jimmy goes, no, because  Jimmy knows what's happening.  He sees it all unfolding. 
[00:15:30]  I know you're not going to sprinkle rainbow jimmies on it.  Oh, yes.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  We got new Paul R. Nelson political ads.  Thank you, Danny.  All right.  We got lots to do.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  Trace yourself.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Vote for me.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  My cake.  Oh, no.  No.  All right.  Here we go.  So here's the audio.  And I don't know. 
[00:16:00]  Whatever.  Just listen.  Is this Andrew?  Hey, Andrew.  Wow.  Where's it been?  How you doing, Andrew?  I love watching the decline of Andrew.  Andrew, where the f*** have you been?  Andrew, they're taking your spot over there.  The guy took your spot with a box and a cat.  And my spot is a lot spot.  Oh, yeah.  They take it.  God bless me.  He paid that man his money.  Are you cold?  Are you cold today?  I'm cold.  Of course I'm cold.  Are you all drunk?  You look a little woozy today.  You look a little drunk.  No, I'm not drunk. 
[00:16:30]  But I had a couple of views.  A couple when?  About an hour ago?  Last night.  Oh, last night?  Yeah.  Partying with the guys?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box, guys?  Oh.  What is it?  Wow, that looks good, but I am not touching it.  You eat it, Andrew.  Let me see.  Put it down for a second.  No.  It's some kind of a cinnamon cakey thing.  Oh.  Come on.  I had to walk away.  Oh, no.  I'm leaving. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, no.  So right there, Jimmy sounds like a good guy.  Actually, Anthony's already laughing.  Anthony's already laughing.  Because I didn't expect it again.  I am defending myself this morning.  Jimmy, if I stop the tape right here, Jimmy looks like a really, really good guy.  He walked away.  Good Samaritan.  He had the line of the bit with, oh, no.  Oh, no.  You know, so I stop it there.  Jimmy looks good.  But let me continue here.  That's all the tape we have.  I did not find that funny.  I found it offensive and rude. 
[00:17:30]  Might have to go to break.  Aw.  It is very rare that you get a laugh like this out of Jimmy.  Oh, no.  I'm leaving.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, he didn't do that.  Oh, he did not do that.  Oh, no.  You are guilty, sir.  Dude, I laughed hard watching it again on YouTube and segued right into the poker chips 
[00:18:00]  clip.  It's quite the little bookends.  You know, the poker chips clip is moving up on YouTube as well lately.  It's just, the only problem with that clip is, I wish we, no one knew to film it like, now  the filming is so much better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was like two years ago.  Yeah.  So the filming was a little sloppy.  It's still very funny, though.  But I was away when that, like, when Andrew was talking going, oh, I earned that.  I was like 30 feet away.  Yeah.  It's like, you know, I couldn't hear it.  Yeah, we were halfway down the block.  You guys started running.  We ran for our sanity is what we were doing. 
[00:18:30]  And then here's the, uh, some more audio that's not part of the video that's been on  YouTube the last couple of days.  He did not just, oh, no.  You knew it was coming, right?  When I was, hey, let me see that.  It was a full cake.  It was a full cake.  He opened it up and was offering a slice.  Opie grabbed it, put it on the sidewalk and jumped as high as he could and landed on top  of the cake.  Oh, no. 
[00:19:00]  Opie throws money at him.  And as it's going towards him, the wind picks it and blows it to him.  Oh, no.  So he's like, just go, f*** yourself.  So as soon as you put the, you said, put it down.  I actually walked away and I saw you jump up and I walked away.  I just heard that smashing of cake under his feet.  You are despicable.  Oh, what a piece of f*** off.  That was his whole, his whole meal for like a week with that cake.  He was happy to show everyone the cake. 
[00:19:30]  He goes, look.  Both feet landed right in that cake.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that was beautiful.  It was so cringe-inducing, yet fun to watch.  Oh, my God.  You are horrible.  Please get that video up on YouTube immediately.  Thank God it was on tape.  Oh, no.  Oh, that is going to be a great download, man.  Jimmy can't help.  Listen to how hard Jimmy's laughing.  Jimmy really is laughing.  And someone's pointing out, Ant, that when I was in the air, you could actually hear you gasp. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, that, yeah, yeah.  That little gasp.  I couldn't believe you were actually doing it.  Right.  All right.  Well, there you go.  I mean, we had to start the show with that again today because it was just a talk of, I don't know, of the show yesterday and after the show and all that on the message boards.  And a lot of haters out there loving the fact that I'm so cruel.  I don't know. 
[00:20:30]  By the way, I think Sam continued rolling tape.  I think we're going to do a part two.  You know, you guys reacting as we walk down the sidewalk.  I think we're going to try to get that up on YouTube in the next day or so.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  We've got lots to do today.  We've got more negative political ads.  We have the negative political ads for members of this fine radio show coming in finally.  People sending them in.  We heard the first batch, and there's a couple that are worth playing.  They're really, really funny.  And then we've got to talk about Jerry Springer. 
[00:21:00]  We've got to talk about principal banning girls' superhero costumes.  Black Sabbath forms new band without Ozzy.  What's that about, Jimmy?  I just heard that they're getting back together with Dio.  With Dio?  The Dio version?  Yeah.  And we've got lots and lots of people stopping by to say hi today.  We've got Jim Belushi in studio.  We've got John Mayer calling in.  We've got Sharon Osbourne stopping by.  And we've got Dove, how do you say his last name?  Dave Dove.  He is a really, really funny comic. 
[00:21:30]  Yep.  He's calling in.  He must be in L.A.  I'm surprised he's not coming in.  Yeah.  He's calling in a little later today.  So there you go.  Another packed show.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, what's up?  It's Louis Twitchell Santani.  Shut up!  Tourette's Day is coming to the Opie and Anthony show, which is to say that we've discovered  a new excuse to point and laugh at people who are different.  To help us understand a little bit more about Tourette's, we've enlisted the help of hearing  impaired Chicago reporter Karen Meyer.  Tourette's syndrome is a new radical disorder that's characterized by involuntary tick and 
[00:22:00]  repeated vocalizations.  Exactly.  So if you have Tourette's or if you know somebody with Tourette's, muster up some courage and  an ounce of self-control and get in touch with the Opie and Anthony show.  Contact Steve at foundrymusic.com.  That's Steve at foundrymusic.com.  And remember, be yourself one tick at a time.  Tourette's Day.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.

[00:23:30]  Yeah.  And he's going to have lots and lots of Halloween tickets in his back pocket.  So just find Elmo at FH Riley's, my brother's restaurant in Huntington, 400 New York Avenue.  Maybe we need some kind of code word, like, what's that guy, Paul R. what?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  You have to come up to me and say that in that dialect.  Oh, that's right.  And I will present you with tickets.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  My brother doesn't get up before 6 o'clock at night, so, you know, good luck. 
[00:24:00]  So we're talking later in the night at FH Riley's, you know, when the bar starts happening.  When the shots are flowing.  That's right.  So he'll have tickets at FH Riley's Friday and Saturday night, another way to get the Halloween tickets, okay?  Say hi to my other brother who's working his balls off, and we don't get to see anymore because he works, what, 100 hours a week?  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  All right.  We have to promote, by the way, Monday, Paul Stanley in studio.  And I don't know if he's doing the walkover or not.  I hope so. 
[00:24:30]  All right, yeah.  I think that's going to be cool.  I hope so.  Is he bringing his chest hair?  Why?  I hope so.  I'd like a lot of them.  Does he travel without it?  Let's say hi to Mr. H. Mr. H, what's up?  Bo-bo-bo-boys.  Hey, Mr. H.  I got to find out now.  Are we going to do the homeless shopping spree again this year since everybody wants to crap all over the show because Opie jumped on a cake?  And, by the way, that was hilarious.  All right.  I'm out, guys.  Take it easy, guys. 
[00:25:00]  Later.  Not only are we going to do homeless shopping spree again this year, I think Andrew's going to turn out to be the star of homeless shopping.  I think Andrew is going to be more popular than Tippi Tom this year.  He's a perfect candidate.  Right?  He is a perfect candidate.  Homeless, but coherent enough where he could give us good radio in a huge mall.  Homeless shopping will happen again this year, and I do believe we're going to do it on a Saturday.  On a Saturday so we can get some big numbers at the mall.  You want to explain the homeless shopping spree real fast? 
[00:25:30]  Well, we gather up a bunch of the city's homeless.  How many usually?  Fifteen?  Somewhere around there.  Around there.  And then we give them usually over a hundred and something bucks.  The listeners that tag along usually toss them a lot more money, too.  Right.  And they go on a shopping spree for the holidays in one of the really palatial, very nice malls in the area.  And we take them there, and they go shopping. 
[00:26:00]  They buy themselves shoes or coats or whatever else they need that they'll be beat up for the very next evening.  I was going to say, and here's where it gets funny.  Then we let them back out on the streets, the hard, cold streets of New York City with all their brand new stuff.  And then we check in with them a week later, and we find out that they've been robbed for all their stuff.  My coat was taken.  They took my coat.  I earned that coat.  That's the harsh reality as far as the homeless shopping spree goes. 
[00:26:30]  But our listeners are so cool, they just hand over money to these guys, and they do what they have to do with the cold, hard cash they get.  A lot of the stores, too, and the malls wind up giving away some stuff to the guys.  Yeah, it's great every year.  I can't wait to do it this year, especially on a Saturday, because I think it'll be the biggest one ever.  So uplifting.  Anyway, we're going to do that this year.  We're going to be doing the eggnog drinking contest again this year.  Absolutely.  And I think this year, for the first time, we're going to take that out to the public and do it at a location so people can check out all the puking live. 
[00:27:00]  Steve from Bay Show is saying, well, Andrew will say, treat yourselves to the other bums that take his clothes after the homeless shopping spree.  Treat yourselves to my shoes.  No, he'll say, treat yours.  Before the S comes out, a fist will crash into his jaw.  Andrew will treat himself to some applesauce and pudding and other things that don't require taste.  Sip through a straw. 
[00:27:30]  But we will definitely, like I said, do the eggnog drinking contest at a live location.  Yeah.  Because the video just doesn't do it justice every year.  You've got to see the puking for yourself.  The audio is great, but to see it happening, oh, the thrill of sport.  That'll be the third annual, and I think we're going to have to have some preliminary competitions to get some real, real competitors this year.  Because I think Pat has had it too easy the last couple of years.  Yep, he has.  He really has.  Too easy. 
[00:28:00]  He lost last year.  Yeah, but he has the official record.  He does.  So he's the man.  It's going to be hard to break, though, that record.  And then our FHM article comes out Monday or Tuesday.  It's going to be the latest issue of FHM hitting newsstands, I think, Monday or Tuesday.  It's the December issue.  And in that, I just read the article last night.  We talk about feels for meals.  That is a lot of eggnog coming up. 
[00:28:30]  That was audio of God as Obi jumped on that cake.  I haven't heard those clips in a while.  Oh, is that horrid? 
[00:29:00]  And that's why we have to do it in front of a live audience.  Because it's usually in a studio and only 10, 12 people get to enjoy the puking.  Why is that funny?  Anyway, feels for meals, Anthony.  Are we going to attempt to do this again this year?  We've attempted every year.  We've been on the air, Opie, and we've been shot down every time.  I think we've been trying to do this for, I don't know, at least five years.  At least five Thanksgiving seasons. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  And we're going to attempt it again this year.  So we need the lawyers to pay attention.  We need the lawyers at CBS and the lawyers at XM to come together to figure out how we could do this and make it work.  Make it work.  We really, really do have a heart.  It's a wonderful thing.  It would give food to the homeless.  We have hearts on this show.  We want to give food to the homeless, but they won't let us.  Right.  This is a great idea we came up with five years ago, give or take a year. 
[00:30:00]  Basically, it's feels for meals.  Everyone wins, too, because you know how boring it is when they do like a feed the homeless type thing on the radio,  and all they're doing is collecting food and handing it out to the homeless.  The homeless win, but no one else wins.  The listeners don't win.  The radio personalities don't win.  The listeners don't win.  The listeners don't care.  Right.  You know, listeners in general don't give a crap that their local morning zoo guy is broadcasting from a truck for three days until it's filled up with food, 
[00:30:30]  and then he's allowed to go home.  Who cares?  No one cares.  Oh, it's the hackiest bit every Thanksgiving.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I won't leave until this is full.  This truck is full.  Looks like I'm going to be here for a few days.  Come on, people.  Help me out.  I want to go home and see my kids.  Shut up.  So come on down.  Bring a can of something.  You've got to help these people out.  Right.  And then they have like a cot set up, and like they've got a big warm winter coat. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, I'm going to sleep now.  I'm going to try to go to sleep.  I'm going to sleep now.  Mm-hmm.  Are you?  You can stop by all night because, you know, my job is to fill this truck.  I'd lob a big can of beets at his head.  Let's hope it hits right on the corner.  That's what's amazing about radio, too.  One guy comes up with some hacky bit, and then the rest of America has to do it for some reason.  That's the jump on it because it's just great.  This idea, though, I mean, this is brilliant because everyone leaves happy. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  Isn't that the goal in life?  To make as many people happy as possible.  The homeless get fed.  And believe me, they will get – we would collect more food than any just basic food drive could ever do.  Yeah.  The listeners would be happy because they'd hear good radio.  Yeah.  The people contributing the food would be happy because they're getting something out of it, too.  Right.  It's feels for meals.  You take a wonderful, lovely young lady, put her in a refrigerator box. 
[00:32:00]  Well, many different ladies, we decide.  Yeah, yeah.  We need a variety of refrigerator boxes.  Well, with the amount of people, we'd need it lined up like the old telephone booth banks that are just lined up.  Yeah, we need a nice, young, Scarlett Johansson-type girl.  Oh, wow.  You're going to have to give a lot more than just a can of creamed corn for that.  Leave some creamed corn of your own.  That's not creamed corn.  Oh, that was just – those were niblets before you gave it to me. 
[00:32:30]  It's now creamed corn.  It would actually taste better than creamed corn.  This is awful food.  Creamed corn is horrid.  It stinks.  And every year, we set up this bit, and every year, the girls come out of the woodwork.  They want to participate because they understand that this is very important every year.  Sounds from the creamed corn factory.  There's another one.  Ship it off.  So we know we'll get the girls.  There's no doubt in our minds that we'll get the girls. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  So we'll get a young, Scarlett Johansson-type girl.  We need a girl with huge implants.  Yeah, that would be nice.  We need a little variety.  Maybe some itty-bitties.  A girl with itty-bitties.  Guys like those.  Of course.  And maybe an old broad, like a cougar or something.  Just to mix it up.  Just to mix it up.  Hello, boys.  Says it, my first time at the rodeo, boys.  And they get put in the refrigerator boxes. 
[00:33:30]  That's right.  Now, the refrigerator boxes have two strategically cut holes.  Ah, yes.  In the box.  And it's right in line with the girl's bosom.  That's right.  And when you give food or money for food for the homeless, you get to reach in and get feels for your meals that you just gave.  Right.  It's great.  Who's denying this year after year? 
[00:34:00]  Everyone leaves happy.  You know how much food we would collect?  The line would be around the block.  Around the block.  No problem.  Around the block.  And then something about prostitution every year is like, come on.  The girls are covered up because they're in the box.  Right.  How about we say we don't even know what they're doing?  Maybe they're just reaching into the box to hand over their food.  Yes.  How about this?  You're allowed to reach into the box to shake hands with the girl.  That's right.  Okay. 
[00:34:30]  In one box, we put someone else.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  And he shakes your hand and says, vote for me.  Vote for me.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  And in the other box says, girls.  You'll know which one Paul Nelson is because we'll have some lard right by his box and a  ring you can put on for a couple of moments.  All right.  Well, we got to get the lawyers on this.  Oh, I'm sure.  And then we decided, you know, well, they decide, the lawyers, that there's no way you  could do this in public prostitution, blah, blah, blah.  So then we said, all right, we'll have a line and we'll just have them come into the 
[00:35:00]  studio with their, you know, their food and donations and reach into the box.  And actually, we even tried out the box concept.  Yeah, we did it in the studio.  With the brother and sister team.  Yeah, brother and sister came in.  We have to mention that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The sister got in the box, topless.  And the brother was kind enough to try out.  Right.  It wasn't, you know, it wasn't, yeah.  Well, we failed to mention that when we decided to try it out in the Opie and Anthony lab because 
[00:35:30]  we try out all this stuff.  At the institute.  At the institute.  I mean, I was practicing my jumping style for a long time in the lab.  Finally was able to bring that out on the street.  What a horrifically uncomfortable moment that it was when he reached in to that box and  his sister was in there.  So, this is the official announcement.  Again, this year, we're going to attempt to do Feels for Meals. 
[00:36:00]  We're going to try it.  We need our pest to campaign and help us out on this one.  How can we get this done?  That's what I asked today.  And why?  Eric Logan, how do we get this done today?  Elo.  Elo.  Make it work.  Because I don't have any faith in the CBS lawyers.  So, I think at this point, we have to just lean heavy on XM and say, XM, how do we get  this done?  How do we get this done this year?  Yeah.  We want to call a press conference.  We want to get it done.  Have to this year.  Everyone leaves happy. 
[00:36:30]  It's an amazing thing.  How about there's a big fatty in one box, too?  We don't tell you which is which.  Well, that's the beauty.  I think Jimmy's on to something.  You get like four or five boxes and we got one box that's just, it's just a horror show.  Yeah.  A box at the end of seven.  Wait a minute.  Is there a way that there can be a couple of different boxes, there's only a girl in  like two or three of them, and in one of them there's something else, and in one of  them there's something else.  And it's like a crapshoot.  You don't know what you're getting.  Right.  Do you think that might get around the law? 
[00:37:00]  No, I don't know.  I mean, I think it's more fun.  It's a question for the lawyers.  You could get a hot chick or you could get a fat disaster.  That'd be nice.  Yeah, let's figure out the lawyers.  And one, you just feel a hairy chest.  Yeah.  And then when you go, who is it this is here?  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  All right.  Thank you.  Could you tweak a little?  So, yes, we're doing homeless shopping, the homeless shopping spree.  Yes, we're doing the eggnog drinking contest at a live location this year.  That's going to be very exciting.  We do that more near Christmas, so like early December, we'll get into the eggnog drinking 
[00:37:30]  contest after we get through Thanksgiving.  And for Thanksgiving, we want to do feels for meals.  We got three huge bits we want to do in the next two months.  All right?  Make it work.  All right, Anthony.  Anti-Ron Kind political ad.  We got to replay this one from yesterday.  And then we got brand new Paul R. Nelson political ads.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Of course you are. 
[00:38:00]  Who else could sound like such a dork?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  He really is a tool, this guy.  Just a remover of all that's fun.  An ass.  He's a fun sponge.  This political ad we're about to play was the highlight of yesterday's show.  Yeah.  So you got to listen to the O.P. Nantes show a little longer.  You're missing some great stuff.  You really are.  It's not a joke.  It's not a joke.  This is the worst anti-political campaign ad we have found so far. 
[00:38:30]  The mudslinging going on in this one is just unbelievable.  Although the one we saw this morning with bada-bing was up there.  Yeah.  We got to pull that one, find out what that's all about.  We got the story.  So we'll do that in a minute or two here.  But here's the Paul R. Nelson anti-Ron Kind political ad.  This is a race for, what is it for?  For dog catcher, I think.  Dog catcher?  I really don't know.  Do we even know what they're running for?  It's in Wisconsin somewhere.  Congress?  I know.  It's in Wisconsin.  Or is it, yeah, it's in Wisconsin. 
[00:39:00]  It's either Congress or Governor.  I have no idea.  Who cares?  With our servicemen and women facing death every day, what kind of congressman would try  to gut military spending?  The wrong kind.  Ron Kind.  That's right.  Congressman Ron Kind has repeatedly voted to deprive our troops of the funding they need  to fight for us.  But Ron Kind has no trouble spending your money.  He would just rather spend it on sex.  That's right.  Instead of spending money on cancer research, Ron Kind voted to spend your money to study  the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes. 
[00:39:30]  Instead of spending money to study heart disease, Ron Kind spent your money to study the masturbation  habits of old men.  Ron Kind spent your tax dollars to study something called the bisexual, transgendered, and two-spirited  Aleutian Eskimos, whoever they are.  Ron Kind even spent your tax dollars to pay teenage girls to watch pornographic movies with probes  connected to their genitalia.  Ron Kind pays for sex, but not for soldiers.  If Ron Kind had better priorities, you wouldn't be having to hear this.  Ron Kind is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress. 
[00:40:00]  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve wholeheartedly.  We ought to try to get Paul R. Nelson on the phone, too, because just...  I want both of them.  We love his ads.  I think we're getting his campaign manager on the show today.  I want to hear...  Kind or Paul?  Paul.  Paul's?  I believe so.  Kind on Monday.  And then maybe Kind on Monday.  We'll see what we can work out.  Yeah.  Because I want to talk to these guys.  This race is the race of the country for this election. 
[00:40:30]  There's some crazy accusations there.  Now, yeah, the accusations there, I got to know what they're based on.  I assume, and what I've read, it's some kind of a big bill that was passed on a study of human sexuality.  Yeah.  And he wasn't the only one that voted for it.  A lot of the Democrats especially voted for it.  And they kind of make it sound like it's just a case-by-case, each separate one was a separate vote, and he just can't get enough of it. 
[00:41:00]  The electrodes and the old men.  You think potential voters understand that he obviously didn't...  I don't know.  You know what?  If this didn't work, if this type of campaigning didn't have a track record of working, they wouldn't use it.  And wouldn't go this far.  And sadly, it's working.  The negative campaign ads are working to make people win these elections.  So people are stupid, yes.  The majority of the country is stupid and just buys this at face value. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  And I'm talking both ways.  I have no political affiliation with this whatsoever.  I love that...  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  ...is putting out these ads.  And I love the fact that Ray Kine...  Ron Kine.  Ron, the wrong kind.  The wrong kind.  I can't even remember his name.  You just think Ron, because they put a W, and then Ron, and a G.  And a G.  That's what they do.  Well, the announcer purposely says Ron, but in such a way it sounds like he's saying Ron. 
[00:42:00]  And nothing's better in that spot.  Take away the content of that ad.  And the announcer is great.  How he's just so dumbfounded over...  Oh, his acting is awful.  Whatever that means.  Whatever that means.  How did your genitals get probed?  Why not?  Why not?  I was going to say he went to the Steve School of Acting.  What do you use, Grandpa?  That's lean.  You know, we talk about this from time to time.  Honey.  You bring the Opie and Anthony show home with you. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  For me, I'm walking around my house going, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  That's a big E.  Nelson.  Get the S.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Nelson.  Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  His tongue.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  And I owe my kids money for for Girl Scout cookies. 
[00:43:00]  And I'm dodging them.  I'm dodging them.  Want to buy a dryer?  Door?  What have you brought home from the show lately?  I'm doing that.  I'm doing, of course, the Iron Man.  Yeah, that's the one I've been doing.  What?  No.  Iron Man.  No.  Treat yourself.  Hey, guys.  Like his friends had finally stopped by.  Dropped by.  With his rotted Starbucks cake.  I saw a mouse.  Sidewalk warming party.  I saw another mouse in my kitchen. 
[00:43:30]  I looked at the mouse.  I go, treat yourself.  Hey, Ovi, at least he put food out for his guests.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm trying to think what else I brought home lately.  Oh, fruit.  Would you like some fruit?  Yeah, I did that a couple times.  Blueberries I brought home.  Little tidbits.  That'll get you hit, though.  Blueberries?  Yeah.  It was awful.  Yeah.  All right.  When we get back, we got the brand new Paul R. Nelson political ad. 
[00:44:00]  I can't wait.  Ron Kine voted for the destruction of marriage.  The destruction.  He supports partial birth abortions.  Of course he does.  Until the age of 11.  And he refuses to secure the border.  He also voted to allow child molesters to immigrate to this country.  And as they're telling you this in this political ad, they're showing 9-11 footage.  Wow.  Just a barrage of evilness. 
[00:44:30]  This Paul R. Nelson has an evil streak in him.  Ron Kine is the wrong.  Ron Kine hates buildings over 50 stories.  Jesus.  So we have that, and then we got the first batch of political ads about the O.P. and Anthony  show.  Yeah, we love how negative ads, the politicians are pulling them on each other.  They're very entertaining.  And we just want the listeners to come up with some based on the show.  That's right.  And we got a couple worth playing.  Why am I the target of so many?  I don't know, man. 
[00:45:00]  You sure love goofing on me.  Maybe I see a lot of incriminating things.  You know what?  Two out of the three we're going to play today are...  Against me.  Against you.  They're anti-Anthony ads.  There's a pro Bill Burr, a pro Jim Norton, and a pro Steve that came in overnight.  And they have to bash me.  See?  I'm hoping we get more of these, by the way.  Yeah.  So far, so good.  Where should they send them?  What?  Danny.  Danny.  To Danny at foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com. 
[00:45:30]  On opiananthony.com, I think there's a link that says submit material or something like  that.  Yeah.  Submit stuff here.  You just click on that link.  There you go.  It has all the info, I believe.  Whip up a negative campaign ad for the show and send it in.  All right.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Jim Norton will be appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman, Wednesday, November  1st.  Check local listings for showtimes.  This is the O.B.  and Anthony Show.  Hey, good morning.  They're checking out the O&A show.  A couple things. 
[00:46:00]  Fatty Pig Fatty brought to you by H57 Hootia.  Lose weight for free at H57.com.  We have like two days left in the contest, basically.  That's it.  We're taking tomorrow off.  Jimmy and Anthony are flying out to Colorado to get married or something.  I don't know.  I don't know what they're doing, but is that state one of the states?  We don't know.  We're just going to try all 50.  There's a rally there we're attending.  Yeah.  Of the like-minded gentlemen.  Yeah.  Yes. 
[00:46:30]  Current leader, 505 pounds.  Honey from Binghamton.  You got to beat 505 pounds.  Now, what's going on?  There were two other girls that were going to stop by.  Yeah.  Steve was all excited.  I think it was Thursday or Friday of last week.  He's so excited.  He's telling everyone, we got three girls for Monday.  I'm like, come on, Steve.  If one shows up, I'd be happy.  We'll be lucky.  And it turned out one did show up.  But what happened to the other two?  Supposedly one is pushing 600.  Steve is a twit.  600 pounds.  Travis, you know something?  Of course she does. 
[00:47:00]  What's up, Travis?  Steve says one of them's coming in on Monday.  The girl from Cleveland, I think.  How much does she weigh?  I think she's the 600 pounder.  Oh, wow.  God, what a great way to end Fatty Pig Fatty if she shows up.  Big.  Of course, $10 a pound to the winner of the heaviest girl that comes through that door behind Anthony.  Also, $1,000 finder's fee for the person that brings in the winner of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Yes.  Okay, so we got that going on.  A little later today, we got Sharon Osbourne stopping by. 
[00:47:30]  We got John Mayer calling in to say hi.  We got Jim Belushi in about 15, 20 minutes.  Chicago's own Jim Belushi.  We're keeping an eye on Chicago.  Keeping an eye on you.  Also, we got to get into the Madonna thing and her voice.  It's driving Anthony nuts.  Her effective voice.  I can't take it because, you know, do you remember what she sounded like years ago?  Well, she's from Detroit.  Yeah.  She's from Detroit.  Go Tigers!  And what the hell is she sounding like? 
[00:48:00]  Huh?  Well, she's got kind of like...  I wanted to adopt this child from Africa.  Africa.  From Africa.  Africa.  And she's there via satellite from England.  Yeah.  Well, she's got kind of an English accent.  Oprah.  Sort of like an English slash proper, I don't know.  Yeah.  Michigan accent.  What it is.  Whatever.  But Oprah was just there with her big watery eyeballs looking at this big video screen of 
[00:48:30]  Madonna from England and they're all just lapping.  Just lapping at her.  Anything Madonna said, the audience, all those women in there just applauding.  Stupid fat hens.  And Oprah just, God bless you, Madonna, for what you're doing.  She's like, I just want to save one child. 
[00:49:00]  Give one child a life that it wouldn't have.  Save the world.  Go ahead.  Have fun.  All right.  We can play a quick clip.  Here's Madonna.  I hope you would ask Madonna, could you lay that child on the ground and then just jump  on it?  I would not do that.  It would be really funny if she goes, look, I was at someone's house.  I saw one on the lawn holding a lantern.  I had to have one for myself.  I need one.  It was adorable.  Is there something about the black children adopting if you're a rich celebrity, a rich 
[00:49:30]  white celebrity adopting?  Because I don't see like rich black people adopting African children.  It seems to be this thing that rich white celebrities do.  Well, first of all, in general, to adopt a white baby is very, very hard.  So a lot of a lot of parents out there are going to not are going to go to the Ukraine.  Go to the, you know, I'm not, I'm talking, not the United States.  I'm saying are you not in the United States to adopt a white baby is almost impossible. 
[00:50:00]  Of course, but they're flying to Africa.  Why not go to the Ukraine?  They go everywhere.  They go to Korea.  They go to China.  Now they go to the Ukraine.  They go to the former Soviet Union.  And now, and now it's all about Africa because the, you know, it's a celebrity trend.  It's the latest trend.  Like carrying a little doggy around.  It was the little chihuahua.  And now it's something else.  You think it's just like a fashion statement?  It absolutely is now.  Little African kids are accessories.  It's a, it's a Hollywood trend that was started by, by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. 
[00:50:30]  Angelina Jolie.  Angelina Jolie.  Where did Tom Cruise get theirs?  Cruise and Nicole Kidman, where did they get theirs?  What, the one, the recent one?  No, no, no, whatever.  No, sperm bank, but.  No, no, that's the, yeah, his new one.  Yeah.  But he's got a black son.  Yeah, yeah.  Did he start the trend?  No, I don't think so because he hides his kids.  No, because it's all about being seen with, like, the little doggy or the little pet on  the red carpet.  Now the trend is to be seen with your little black adopted baby. 
[00:51:00]  And it's like, it depends on what section of Africa you get it from.  Because she got it from this one section.  Mamawi.  Mamawi.  Mamawi.  Mamawi.  Mamawi.  So now, like, the Mamawi little black children are very popular to snatch up and bring back.  Those kids are showering every other hour and combing their hair and making sure the  flies are off their bodies.  Oh, just.  They're just sitting there waiting.  They're just clicking and snapping little words.  Just clicking and snapping and just hoping, hoping that they'll see a jet land. 
[00:51:30]  Please, Madonna.  I want Madonna as mommy.  Oprah's big into the children of Africa.  Yeah.  She donated a crap load of cash.  She did?  For schools.  Yeah, yeah.  They do good stuff.  I mean, I'm not criticizing that.  Oprah's trying to help every African child.  This just seems a little Joan Crawford-ish.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  A little adopting a kid for the sake of, I don't know, publicity maybe. 
[00:52:00]  Maybe the album didn't sell as well as she would have liked.  The tour didn't get the heat she really wanted.  And you could do these things.  Like, big-time celebrities can do things like this.  She's not going to be actually raising the kid.  No, the nannies do that?  The nannies and stuff.  I'm sure the kid will be allowed to run around in one of her houses.  And how does little Lourdes feel?  Well, the picture on the paper looks like Lourdes is into it.  Yeah?  Yeah, but the white baby, he's looking away like, hey. 
[00:52:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Not my call, folks.  You can see a lot in that picture.  It's in the paper today.  What is it?  Rocco or Rocky?  What's it?  Rocco, I think.  What?  Rocco?  Yeah.  Rocco.  Dude.  Hey, dude.  Get this kid out of here.  Here's Madonna on Oprah.  When did you realize that it had become this big of a deal?  I didn't realize that the adoption was causing any controversy until I came back.  And, you know, there was a million film crews in the airport and press camped outside my door. 
[00:53:00]  I don't read newspapers or watch television, but all of my friends have let me know what everybody's talking about and what's going on in the news.  How does she?  Are you hurt by it?  Are you angry?  I wouldn't say I'm hurt by it.  Yeah, I can't just sit through that.  If someone doesn't watch TV or the news, why are you so anti-Bush and anti-the war if you don't know what's going on?  If you have no idea what's going on, why do you make so many political statements and have such a strong feeling about what's going on? 
[00:53:30]  You want to be anti-Bush or against the war?  Fine.  But you've got to be educated.  Right.  If you don't read the paper, how would you know either way?  If she doesn't, she said she doesn't read the paper or watch the news.  Where is she getting her fans and her people and her yes men let her know?  No, you're missing it, I think.  I think she probably watches and reads more than anybody.  But it's hip to say, look, I'm so cool.  I don't even watch TV.  You know, I don't watch TV.  It's all trash, trash TV.  And I don't read the papers because it's slanted one way or the other. 
[00:54:00]  This woman is watching.  She probably is on fan sites.  She's been saying that she doesn't watch TV or read the newspapers for many, many years.  It's BS.  It's impossible.  She makes her living off pop culture.  I don't even know who you are, Okra.  Why is she such a –  Yeah, how does she even know who Oprah is?  Yeah.  Good point, Anthony.  She wouldn't know.  Why is it so bad to watch TV?  Why is that such a sign in some people's minds of being brilliant that you don't watch TV? 
[00:54:30]  In Madonna's mind, TV is so below her.  She has ascended to a place in life so high above us.  It's just ridiculous.  We are mere one-celled creatures.  To Madonna.  Yeah.  She's like one of those glowing people on Star Trek.  You know her kids aren't allowed.  That give us, like, sympathy.  Maybe one day we can communicate, but talking to you is like talking to blah, blah, blah, you know, a paramecium or something. 
[00:55:00]  Madonna's that person now.  She doesn't allow her kids to watch TV either.  Why would you?  Yeah.  You want your kids to be just like you.  But it's BS.  It has to be.  Well, she wants to – no wonder she's out of touch.  She doesn't read the paper or watch television.  No wonder her idea of rebellion is that cornball cross thing she did.  Like, you know, attacking the Catholic Church in the middle of what's going on with all the terrorism.  Like, that's the big target.  That's the big safe target she shows.  She stinks. 
[00:55:30]  Stupid African kid.  I hope it bites her and gives her something.  I wouldn't say I'm hurt by it.  I would say I'm disappointed because more than anything – I mean, for me, I understand that gossip and telling negative stories sells newspapers.  But I think, for me, I'm disappointed because more than anything, it discourages other people from doing the same thing.  For anybody who had the idea that they, too, would like to open their home and give a life to a child living in an orphanage who might possibly not live past the age of five would be discouraged from doing it. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, God.  I have it.  For me, that's what –  I never root for kids to die.  It's not nice to do.  Of course not.  But I will say that if one had to go in some household accident, what better home for it to happen in?  Imagine having something like a giant $50,000 crystal chandelier come smashing down on that child's head. 
[00:56:30]  Something that never would have happened to it had he been left alone with his father.  I love the fact that father wants to milk this bitch with some more cash.  Yeah, that's what I'm doing.  I want my kid back.  Right.  She'll send him a check, and that'll be that.  It drinks some kind of $1,000 an ounce perfume.  Off of Madonna's vanity.  And she's raised awareness.  Who is she kidding?  I'm helping.  She's raised the awareness of the plight of the African children.  It's the latest thing to do. 
[00:57:00]  That's all.  I don't even –  Is to go over there.  A lot of celebrities go to Africa just to be photographed there.  George Clooney's been doing it.  He's got some African cause.  Everyone has an African cause.  I don't know.  It just seems like a thing that white celebrities enjoy doing.  I think it gives them some credibility.  It gives them some passes with the black community if they do that.  I hope that that kid's riding around Damien while she's fixing something, and she falls 
[00:57:30]  off the balcony.  Look.  Nice little fishbowl.  All right.  Enough about Madonna.  There's a bunch of clips.  Wonderful.  She's a good talker.  There's a bunch of clips.  Any applause breaks?  I don't know.  There's one of them because I just caught the one where Oprah's talking, ask her a question,  she answers, and the audience just goes wild for her.  Oh, really?  If you got it, fine.  If you don't, screw it.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I just don't care. 
[00:58:00]  I want to hear the applause break.  Madonna's good.  Madonna.  She's a good person.  She sounds a little more Irish, though.  Yes.  She's got something going on where it's almost English.  I guess English and American accent mixed almost sounds Irish.  Is that what it is?  Or does she live in Ireland or England?  She lives in England.  She lives in England, but she sounds more Irish, like there's some kind of an Irish little  twinge at what she's saying.  She's trying to put it on, obviously, because that's what a dumb bitch she is.  She thinks that not watching TV and sounding British makes her brilliant and interesting. 
[00:58:30]  She is really hip in 1930.  Madonna is a jackass.  I want to go get me one of those.  Where did you get one?  You mean if I wash it, it won't come off?  Let's see if you have a big elephant feet table in our living room.  This is my mask room.  This might be the applause break.  I was traveling with a pediatrician named Sonia Sachs, who is an amazing woman, married to  Jeffrey Sachs, who started the whole Millennium Village project. 
[00:59:00]  Project.  And I took her with me on all of my rounds to all of the orphanages, not just for the sake  of, you know, testing David or finding out the health of the children I was interested  in adopting, but to look after children in general.  And she was incredibly generous to do that with me.  She went well above and beyond what I had asked her to do in the first place.  What you asked her to come to Africa and check out kids and get a healthy one without HIV is 
[00:59:30]  pretty much what you wanted.  Absolutely.  Because all those kids in those orphanages, the majority of them are HIV positive.  And Oprah asked Madonna if her adopted son there was HIV positive.  And Madonna dragged out the answer so much, I swore Oprah was going to tease it for the  next commercial break and come back and we'll tell you if Oprah's adopted kid has AIDS after  these words. 
[01:00:00]  She stretched it out to dramatize it.  She was dramatizing this whole thing.  And then she finally said, no, he's healthy.  He had pneumonia, but he does not have HIV.  And, you know, that's like a great thing.  Thank God.  I love the fact that this really weird thing, this condescending thing people do when she's  talking about the woman who she brought with her.  And she's just an amazing person.  Is she?  How?  She's a pediatrician.  Get a free trip to Africa with Madonna.  Exactly.  She hands out Flintstones chewables. 
[01:00:30]  Could yap to your friends that you went with Madonna on a private plane to Africa.  Well, well, she's amazing.  Walter from Indianapolis says it all on the feedback.  Madonna should adopt a black kid from Detroit.  Now that's a worthy cause.  They asked her also, there was rumors that she was going to adopt some inner city child  from L.A.  And she met with Brad and Angelina about it.  And she had, Madonna said, no, that was all fabricated.  That she never intended on doing that.  She's got this Africa thing. 
[01:01:00]  Look, man, it's all about getting some press.  I'm sorry.  That's what she's doing.  She's getting a lot of press.  She's getting a ton of press.  You know, her star isn't as bright as it used to be.  Neither are her kids.  It's fading a bit.  And these people in Hollywood that are these egomaniacs, they find ways to get their star  brighter.  Yeah.  You know, because she could have easily just adopted an inner city kid from somewhere and 
[01:01:30]  not and not alerted the press about it.  Yeah.  I wouldn't put it past any of these celebrities.  The press that she hates because she doesn't watch TV or the newspapers, but uses the press  when she needs to.  It's amazing how they travel with her, right?  Right.  She doesn't know that they exist.  She never has a paper.  Right, right, right.  Everywhere she goes.  Yeah.  She's so hypocritical, man.  She stinks.  Yeah, she talks about how the press bashes her and this is a lie and that, but she doesn't  read it.  Someone had to send out the press release.  Yeah.  This is what Madonna's doing. 
[01:02:00]  And I wouldn't put it past these celebrities like this, you know, the pompous ones like  her, to cause the controversy with the father.  You know, pay him off some money and go, look, we need you to recite a few lines about how  you didn't know what adoption means, this.  It'll make more controversy and make this whole thing fabricated.  They're known for fabricating what happens in their private life for press. 
[01:02:30]  And if she doesn't read the papers or watch TV, first of all, why does it concern her what  people are saying enough that she has to come on over and defend herself?  Who cares what people are saying?  What's the difference?  You don't read it?  Why?  You don't read it?  It doesn't affect you?  What's the difference?  Why do you care?  Look, in the end, you know, she's doing a good thing.  She's raised awareness, all that, you know, but she's also using this to make sure that  people are still talking about it.  Attending her concerts.  That's what it comes down to.  Putting asses in seats.  Wouldn't it be funny if her, her husband, Brad and Angelina just got together and watched 
[01:03:00]  their two adopted kids play and just told vicious racist jokes all night while drinking.  Oh my God.  Oh, jeez.  They're all getting tanked on, like, on Schmidt.  What's it called?  Oh, Schlitz.  Schlitz.  Schmidt.  Might as well be.  Schmidt.  Hey, uh, we...  They all get too drunk and realize they shouldn't have videotaped it.  We, uh...  See that?  You just see Madonna slapping her leg, an empty boat! 
[01:03:30]  Uh, yes.  Someone is bringing up.  I want an Oompa Loompa, Daddy.  Yeah.  I want it now.  Madonna does have that.  I want an African baby.  Uh, we need to play a Paul R. Nelson ad before we take a break.  Certainly.  Because that's what we promised during this segment of the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Nelson.  I want to hear the Nelson and the S again. 
[01:04:00]  Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Nelson.  He gets it under control just before it gets a little crazy there.  Paid for by fuddy duddies for Nelson.  Fuddy duddies.  Fuddy duddy.  Baby talk, baby talk.  It's a wonder you can walk.  All right.  My opponent, Buddy Hinton, won't let me say my name.  Peter has to hit him.  Here's another anti-Ron kind campaign ad from Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:04:30]  When Hezbollah terrorists murdered 241 Marines in Lebanon,  a teenage boy from western Wisconsin enlisted in the United States Marine Corps to help fight the war on terror.  23 years later, that young Marine is successful businessman Paul R. Nelson,  and he's running for the United States Congress because his congressman, Ron Kind, is the wrong kind.  You see, Ron Kind refuses to secure the border against illegal aliens. 
[01:05:00]  Instead of deporting these illegals, Ron Kind wants to give them amnesty and voted to print American ballots in Spanish.  He voted to allow these illegals to burn the American flag during their protests.  He even voted to allow convicted child molesters to immigrate to this country.  Because Ron Kind won't support drilling for new American oil deposits,  we're dependent for oil on Islamic fascists and nations that support terrorism.  And in the war on terror, Ron Kind refuses to support the very measures needed to make sure this never happens again.  Elect Paul R. Nelson, and he'll finish the job he started 23 years ago. 
[01:05:30]  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm going to join the Marines.  Hoorah.  Semperfi, Sarge.  That must have been some scene with him and the drill, Sarge.  Let me see your war face.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:06:00]  Work on it.  A jelly donut, sir.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and there's jelly donuts in my footlocker.  I'm sorry.  Who the hell said that?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  This is my rival.  This is my gun.  I like fighting, and I hate fun.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  How does he stink? 
[01:06:30]  Anyone else notice the Lord of the Rings music in the background?  Yeah.  Want to hear another one?  You little scumbag!  I got your name!  I got your ass!  You want to hear another one?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Yeah, please.  Uh-oh.  This can't be good.  No.  My name is Rebecca, and I'm...  Oh, no.  All right.  Okay, hold it, hold it, hold it.  Let's guess what Rebecca has. 
[01:07:00]  Come on, let's guess what Rebecca has.  Let's hope it's a disease.  First of all, wait a minute.  Whose ad is this?  This is an anti-Ron kind.  Oh, okay.  Anti-Ron kind.  And so, it can't be for stem cell research.  She's sick?  I know the answer, unfortunately.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  She's sick or something?  I'm out.  Obama!  And Paul Nelson knows the cure.  What?  And Ron kind made her sick by throwing poisons in her face while helping an immigrant. 
[01:07:30]  I think that sounds like it.  While he was burning an American flag.  The toxins from the American flag he was burning.  She breathed it in and got very ill.  Because he burns them in nurseries.  He burns them in nurseries and burns flags.  With the music.  What a rotten mind.  Well, obviously, she's got a disease.  And instead of voting for money that would go to research to help this girl, he voted  to see what gay guys do when the lights go out and the lard comes out of the fridge. 
[01:08:00]  Two old man talking, one yelling, I prefer a Ritz.  I prefer it on a saltine.  Oh, well, tomato, tomato.  Yeah.  Ron kind percentage.  He decided to study the grope room.  Grope room.  Remember that?  He decided to do a study of rest stops and the holes that are drilled in the side of  the stall.  Oh, the piano.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This isn't good.  Pulling at the heartstrings. 
[01:08:30]  She sounds adorable.  My name is Rebecca, and I'm seven.  I'm learning a lot in school, but there is still a lot I don't know.  One day, Grandma said I was going to have a little sister.  I couldn't wait to have someone to play with.  Mommy's tummy started to get bigger, and I got really excited.  Today, Mommy came home from the doctor, and now I don't have a sister anymore.  Rebecca's mother had a partial birth abortion, and Ron actually supports the scheme of the  death. 
[01:09:00]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, it is terrible.  Wow.  Maybe that little sniveling snitch goes to the mother and I want another one running  around the house.  Yeah, really?  Oh, boy.  Annoying, whining little child.  It's your fault.  I want another one of these.  Two pieces.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Jimmy Norton.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:09:30]  And I want you to have your water head.  I bet you when they pull it out, it was like one of those marshmallow-y Easter candies you  pull it out.  All right.  His little feet are kicking.  Come on, cut it out.  I'm not done yet.  Holy shit.  And Monkine actually supports this heinous procedure.  Yeah, yeah.  As the father of four children and expecting our fifth, I understand how beautiful a life  is.  Ew.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  And I approve of this message. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, yes.  And let's elect me.  I understand how beautiful a life is.  Unless I'm pumping a bullet into someone in Lebanon or Beirut.  That's not stupid.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, really.  I've killed more people than I've made.  I have four children.  That's seven less ears than I've severed.  Right.  For victory trophies.  I got an ear for each kid.  In my keepsake box.  I don't like your soft approach to this one.  I know.  Because you can still hear the voice, too.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:10:30]  And how precious a life is.  That's how the A-rab laughs at you.  Oh, you ever see a head come apart like that?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  R. Nelson.  And I approve of this message.  Approve.  Elect me to Congress, and I will work to end the barbaric practice of partial birth abortion.  Paid for by Marine Corps veteran and Hockey Dad, Paul R. Nelson.  Ew.  Hockey Dad?  Boy, are they just pouring everything on top of that? 
[01:11:00]  Hockey Dad?  And guy that takes the recycling bin out to the sidewalk every Friday.  Boy, are they reaching.  Hockey Dad?  Hockey Dad?  Where did that come from?  Paul R. Nelson, and I'm a Hockey Dad.  I guess Ron Kine doesn't like hockey?  Former Marine and guy that always puts the toilet seat down when he's done.  What a douche.  Well, this is where I think Paul R. Nelson really is a douche.  He's using 9-11 footage for his own benefit in this next spot. 
[01:11:30]  Unfortunately, this is radio, so he can't see.  But just picture what we all have burnt into our memories.  Yeah, just picture 9-11 footage as he goes after Ron Kine in this political ad.  Really?  Marriage?  It's got to be about the gay marriage.  Yeah.  This is what paid for by Marine Corps Veteran and Hockey Dad, Paul R. Nelson for Congress.  Because they love their hockey, Wisconsin.  Come on.  Really pushing that hockey thing.  It's awful.  It's great.  He's brutalizing his children to succeed and compete already. 
[01:12:00]  Kids won.  Stupid skates on.  Sounds like he got hit in the mouth with a puck.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  And my teeth fell onto the ice when I was 13.  Like a little chick.  And Paul R. Nelson for Congress.  Look how beautiful she is.  Mommy, her dress is so pretty.  If anyone objects to defending marriage, may you speak now or forever hold your...  Comes Ron. 
[01:12:30]  I object.  Is Ron Kine against marriage?  Ron Kine actually voted twice for the destruction of marriage.  My name is Paul R. Nelson.  And I approve of this message because the foundation of a family is a mom and a dad.  I now pronounce you husband and wife.  Mommy, can we trust anyone to defend marriage?  Don't worry, honey.  Daddy and I are voting Paul R. Nelson for Congress. 
[01:13:00]  Why would the kid care?  How old is this kid?  45?  Right.  Why would the kid care?  Mommy, I'm two.  Can we trust anyone to defend our values?  God, I hope one of Paul R. Nelson's kids is gay.  That's what that's about.  Paul R. Nelson is not a fan of the faggot.  That's basically what he's saying there.  You may now hit the broad with a hockey stick.  That's what he's saying in that ad.  He's not a fan of the faggot.  Wow.  That kid stinks.  What a jerk.  Just make a duty and shut up.  Oh, mommy.  I thought the mother came home and had an abortion. 
[01:13:30]  Well, that kid's never yet.  She's every...  She's...  No, that's the Paul R. Nelson...  It's the same kid.  Oh, yeah.  Same kid.  Same kid.  What happened?  Hmm.  Yeah.  Well, that's the kid that got to live.  Go down to the free clinic and get you one of those abortions.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Show up.  We're running late.  We got to take a break.  Write something on his car door.  Stupid Damone.  Don't vote for Damone.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[01:14:00]  Yes, Damone was trying to get his girlfriend an abortion after he had sex with her in the pool cabana for a very short period of time.  Hey, come on.  Don't blow up my spot.  Hey, Paul.  Isn't this great?  It's an abortion.  Hey, Paul R. Nelson, where'd you get that shirt?  Out of the hamper?  Thought you could use some help with your math homework on such a hot day.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Hey, Rhett. 
[01:14:30]  Well, Ron Kind, I guess, is what?  He's for gay marriage.  So that means he wants to destroy marriage in general.  You're assistant to the assistant manager of the hockey team.  I do.  Anyone object?  I do.  There's only one penis in this marriage, and I don't like it.  Yeah, they have him yelling out in the middle of the wedding.  I do.  That's great.  Brian from PA.  Oh, my God, I'm crying.  Paul R. Nelson having a little girl talk about partial birth abortions is possibly the funniest thing I've ever heard. 
[01:15:00]  I swear, this Wisconsin race is the best.  Yeah, we're looking at other races.  Jersey was a great one last year, but, I mean, this one.  Someone out there is using a Sopranos approach, and they're using bada-bing in their spot.  Well, because of the Jersey ads last year that worked so well in the Corzine Forrester, a little contest, the mob-based ad is really working. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  So they try to—  That's a hot one this year.  Without any connection to organized crime, they try to make the other guy seem like he's in the mob.  Right.  It's hysterical.  It's wonderful.  These guys are the comedy writers.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  We're late.  We could go another half hour on this.  We're late.  We've got Jim Belushi coming in right after the break.  If Jim's listening, sorry to make you wait, buddy.  Sorry to make you wait.  We went on a little roll here.  Yeah.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest has been rejuvenated thanks to a visit from a very girthy honey from Binghamton, New York, 
[01:16:00]  who tipped the scales at 505 pounds and obliterated the competition.  But this doesn't mean there isn't someone larger who can't pry herself off the sofa,  hoist her barely-breathing, blubbery body up to our studios, and limp away with the grand prize.  Remember, the heaviest girl at the end of the contest gets $10 for every memory-repressing, artery-clogging pound on her body.  So if you spend more time upholstering your flesh with cupcakes than you do looking in a mirror, 
[01:16:30]  sign up for the Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Details on opieandanthony.com.  Sponsored by H57 Hootia.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  Oh, my God.  You have no idea what's going on during the commercial break.  Jim Belushi in studio.  We're all huge fans, by the way, Jim.  Why, thanks. 
[01:17:00]  And Jim walks in.  He congratulates Ant and I on our success with the radio show.  Then looks at Jim Norton and goes, you're the guy from Lucky Louie.  You have no idea how happy that makes Jimmy.  To which I just groan because I cannot stand when celebrities come in here and know Jimmy.  It just upsets me.  Oh, man.  He was hysterical on that show.  That show was hysterical.  Thank you.  What's wrong with men of similar ilk?  Discussing things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Similar ilk.  You and Paul R. Nelson are two of the men in my life. 
[01:17:30]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Nelson.  Nelson.  But it's such a relief in my life.  Marine.  Marine.  Hockey dad and a Lucky Louie watcher.  That's a dirty little show.  Jimmy, how happy are you?  That feels good, man.  I'm really happy.  That feels good, right?  Yeah, of course.  I think you're downplaying a little bit because, you know.  Oh, no.  Come on.  That stuff makes you happy.  You know, that show was just, it was a great show because it was a sitcom with, like, real 
[01:18:00]  people talking and real issues and a live audience.  I mean, my sitcom, according to Jim, was a live audience.  It's the same thing, except we really ought to watch what we say, you know.  Yeah, of course.  Because there's a lot of hockey dads watching our show.  Paul R. Nelson might be watching.  Paul R. Nelson.  I'm here to tell you, Jim Belushi, according to Jim, I support that campaign.  It's nice, clean entertainment.  As a congressman, I will make sure that everybody watches the court in the gym in syndication. 
[01:18:30]  Did you see when the marriage was going, the wedding was going on?  Anyone object?  I do.  I.  Yeah.  I object.  I'm a soccer father.  That was Ron.  Ron Kind objected to traditional marriage.  Ron Kind.  Hey, he's Ron Kind.  Oh.  He's wrong.  Well, they put a W.  You should start writing the spots for him, Ron Kind.  No, no.  No, they did.  I wish I could take credit.  That's what they're actually saying.  Oh, they are saying Ron.  The graphic on the screen actually shows Ron Kind's name, and then they put a small W and  a small G at the beginning and end of Ron. 
[01:19:00]  This guy is trying so hard.  And apparently, Ron Kind is a four-term incumbent.  Yeah.  And this new guy, Hockey Dad, is trying to wheel in there.  Do you have any idea how he's doing with the numbers?  He doesn't even have political ads, because it's like, he has no competition.  Just in the bag.  But this guy, Paul R. Nelson, is like, he's giving the shot.  He's got good work, you know?  Publishing works.  You never know, man.  He's really attacking this other guy.  It's really enjoying this.  The most vicious race I've ever heard.  We love the fact that they just, the ads have gotten worse and worse, and there's nothing 
[01:19:30]  about what these guys are for anymore.  At least they used to say, like, I want to do this, that, and my opponent is a scumbag.  Right, right, right.  That's fine.  But at least you kind of hinted to what your agenda is.  There's not a clue what these guys are about.  I have no idea what they think.  It's just bashing.  It's Wisconsin, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the...  That's a good state, too.  I don't understand where this guy popped up.  Race for the coveted state of Wisconsin.  Yeah, it's a cool state.  I mean, you know.  Fighting for the hockey dads. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  I'm a cheese hat, and I need your vote.  Oh, that's right.  Well, Wisconsin does have the Green Bay Packers.  Yeah.  There you go.  They are creeps.  Oh, the Packers.  How about the Bears?  What are we...  What are we?  Like, I'm a Bears fan.  I got to admit, I'm a Jets fan, but the Bears are what?  Six and O?  Six and O, man.  Did you see that show?  That show.  I call it a show because it was a damn show, that Monday night football game against Arizona.  Man, I haven't yelled that loud in, like, four or five years. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, they're romping.  I'm screaming at that show.  I'm a show.  Is that the one that's supposed to be audio of...  Who's the Cardinals coach, Dennis Green?  Right.  Of him freaking out because the Cardinals blew that game?  No, they really blew that game.  They lost that game big time.  And Dallas Green had a press conference where he was pissed off.  And, you know, I agreed with him.  He was right to be pissed off.  Yeah, he gets some great sound bites going, Dennis Green.  Oh, he was great.  We knew the game they're going to play.  We knew the game they're going to... 
[01:21:00]  I'm going to have to pull some of those.  By the way, you're being heard in Chicago.  We're on WCKG in Chicago.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I love Chicago.  You're being heard by maybe 100 people right now.  Those 100 people are good Chicago people on the way to work.  We just started up in Chicago.  Well, congratulations.  WCKG is kind of...  It's way down here.  We're trying to live...  You're going to bring them up.  We're trying.  We're trying, Jim.  That's what they bring us on for.  Well, Chicago has a great history of terrific radio stations, too. 
[01:21:30]  So that's...  They love their own.  That's the problem.  Yeah.  They love their own.  So you've got to work a little harder.  That's why I said we.  That's right.  I'm on a make-believe.  I live right next to the radio station.  One day, we'll have to study a map and just blurt out highways and towns.  Let's do that.  94.  There you go.  You're on I-94 right now, driving into work.  We want to say hi to everyone on I-94.  There you go.  You know the parents are doing very well.  Jim just made a local for us.  There you go.  I'm too stupid.  I just know a couple of things about Chicago.  Mike Haggerty.  I'm hanging out with Mike Haggerty outside that garage from the Steve McQueen movie where 
[01:22:00]  the car backed out of it.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Right.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  Yeah.  I remember the movie, but I'm sure they all know.  No, but we all know those landmarks.  We know where the Blues Brothers were shot in Chicago, where Steve McQueen, Thomas Horn,  his car went off the Marina Towers into the Chicago River.  We know all those little spots.  Is that what that is?  Yeah.  Okay.  That was great.  That's right where the House of Blues is now.  Oh, yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Right where the Steve McQueen did it.  Yeah, there's two towers, Marina Towers, building in the 60s, and they took a car up 
[01:22:30]  to the top parking lot, and they drove it off.  Actually, that movie, Thomas Horn was being shot at the same time the Blues Brothers was  being shot, so it was a big deal.  Were you performing back then?  I was in Second City.  So you were doing Second City while he was doing SNL?  No.  No, Blues Brothers, though.  Okay.  SNL.  When he was doing SNL, I was finishing college, and I was on the road doing something,  and I went to Second City in 76, and I started in 75. 
[01:23:00]  A little foggy?  Thinking back?  It's a little foggy this morning is what it is.  Yeah, certainly about it.  I'm on L.A. time, so I'm at 5 in the morning for me.  That's brutal.  Second City puts out a lot of funny people.  Man, John Candy, right?  Wasn't he Second City?  Oh, yeah.  Candy.  He's from Canada, right?  Canada, the Canadian one, sure.  Marty Short, who's on Broadway right now, has a great show, by the way.  Yeah.  He's from the Second City.  He's a great deal.  Bill Murray, Gilda Radner, all the great set in that, a lot of people. 
[01:23:30]  Do you remember an actor, this is completely off the subject, that no one else remembers?  He's a black guy.  He was in 48 Hours.  He was in used cars named Frank McRae.  No.  No one remembers him.  Uh-uh.  I'm obsessed with Frank McRae.  I remember Frank McRae.  Why are you obsessed with Frank McRae?  He was always yelling and obsessed.  He just screams.  Yeah.  He was Eddie Murphy's sergeant in 48 Hours.  Oh, okay.  The big black guy, berating him and screaming at him.  No?  That one's going right by me.  All right.  I'm still on Paul R. Nelson, so.  Paul R. Nelson.  Who isn't?  We could talk about him all morning.  Love to, and we will. 
[01:24:00]  We certainly will.  Love to hate that guy.  No, but Chicago has a great tradition of radio, but also of comedy because of Second  City and my son, actually, I'm going today, going back to Chicago.  He has a play called This Is My Youth that's opening at the Pine Box Theater, opened up  last week.  Got great reviews.  Awesome.  I'm really excited to go back to Chicago to see him.  It's a great place for a young actor to get his chops, you know.  Another generation of Belushi.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who's the guy that started Second City?  I did a read with, Chaz Palmitari called it. 
[01:24:30]  I wasn't auditioning.  It was a read my friend got me, and I bought, I was so bad, I was atrocious.  This guy was nervous because it was Chaz, and the other guy in the room was handing  out Second City books, and it turns out it was the guy that started, I believe, Second  City, if that's who it is, if he's still living.  Handing out books?  Should that be the worst description?  I don't think the guy started Second City with handing out books.  No, no, no, no.  He had copies of the Second City book, and he was just giving them to us.  We were in this read with, like, 20 people.  He had them there.  It was like a gift for everyone. 
[01:25:00]  They'd go back to his box on the sidewalk.  Oh, well, those great guys like Paul Sills, are you talking about?  That might be it.  I don't remember.  Paul Sills is a great guy.  He could have named any name, but I would have said that might be it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jackass.  Mike Haggerty?  Yeah, yeah.  Mike Haggerty.  Absolutely.  I'm a fool.  You were talking about cons just before we came back from break.  Oh, my cousin.  My cousin was a good con.  I want to get into that a little bit.  He's a good con.  He was a great con artist.  We were talking about that House of Games with Joe Martino, and when I watched that movie,  it was like, oh, that's my cousin.  He taught me a couple cons.  One was called, you could only do it a long time ago with the airlines. 
[01:25:30]  You can't do it anymore because of security and everything, but before, when it was loose  around the airlines, it was called putting a friend on a plane.  You would buy a ticket in your name in cash.  You would go down to the gate, and you'd give the ticket to your friend, and he would go  on to the plane.  And, you know, they used to rip the ticket off, and they'd have the receipt, and they'd  stack it in a little pile.  And then, as soon as they shut the door, the FAA regulation says you can't open a door 
[01:26:00]  unless it's an emergency, right?  As soon as they shut the airline door, you come running down the hall screaming, wait a  minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.  I got to get on a plane.  I got to get on a plane.  I got off to make a phone call.  You've got to open the door.  You've got to open the door.  They go, oh, sorry, Mr. Belushi can't open the door right now.  Oh, I need to get to Chicago.  I need to get there.  Well, do you have a pass?  No, I'd left it on a plane, but my name's right there.  Here, check the receipts.  They go through, and they see your name. 
[01:26:30]  And they say, well, can we rebook you?  No, just give me my ticket.  So, when you take it, you cash it in, you get your money, your friend's on a plane.  That's awesome.  That's just one of them.  Yeah, you can't do that anymore.  Yeah, now?  You can't do that one, no.  You watch old movies, and you see things that happen at airports, and they're not that old  either, but, you know, they just walk right up to the gate with that.  Goodbye, darling.  Yeah.  Hello, they're kissing at the gate.  That's it.  Walk right into the plane.  Those are the old days.  Now you can't get within, yeah.  You can't get in within a mile now.  You can't get in. 
[01:27:00]  You've got to say goodbye at the house.  Yeah.  You can't even drive.  You can't even get in the car.  They're driving to the airport.  I'm sorry.  We can't let you on the street right now.  All our noses is coming through, and we've got security.  We've been doing a lot of flying because of the job lately, and we were just talking about  going into the restroom.  We, unfortunately, were booked on a pretty old airline, and we're on an old plane, and  they had a place to dispose of razors.  Oh, that's an old plane.  Yeah, it is.  And they had ashtrays.  Oh, I love the ashtrays, too.  Ashtrays and a place to dispose of your razors, because, you know, you get to go in the bathroom 
[01:27:30]  and shave, can you imagine?  And I used to shave a lot.  Now I can't shave.  Yeah, I can't shave on the plane.  In Wisconsin, when you fly, though, you go back to your seat, and you're scared for  the rest of the flight.  You're like, how old is this plane?  A whites-only sign over a bulkhead.  The fact that they used to let people smoke on a plane is beyond me.  I was thinking about that, because I used to smoke like a furnace on a plane.  That's insanity. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  Especially going to Europe or something.  I mean, just pack that plane full of smoke.  And I could have two friends in a car on any given weekend, after a couple of drinks, my  back seat would catch on fire from some idiot, like, flicking his ashes, and, you know, all  of a sudden, you go, what's burning?  Ah, pull over!  The seat's on fire!  Now you've got an entire plane full of drunken idiots.  Yeah, right.  How did more planes didn't just burst into flames and plummet with people allowed to just smoke 
[01:28:30]  anywhere?  Well, they still let you smoke pot in the bathroom.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, yeah, that's cool.  You just can't smoke cigarettes.  And shave.  You're on some of the points.  And they never say it's illegal.  They just say disabling the smoke detector is illegal.  I don't get that.  Not setting it off.  I'm looking at it just trying to disable the damn thing.  I want to disable that.  Here's how our friend would do it.  Rich Voss, the comic.  And what he would do, it was just pretty brilliant.  He's a dummy, but it was a pretty brilliant idea.  He took a bathing cap, and he would put it over the alarm and then smoke real quick in 
[01:29:00]  the bathroom.  That's good.  Jeopardize everyone's lives.  And it wouldn't hit the alarm.  You know, what I used to do is I used to, you know, when you press the drain, that air,  it would go...  Oh, yeah.  I used to sit in this bowl, bench over the bowl, holding a cigarette down with a bowl.  Please tell me you were famous at the time.  I was famous there.  I am, absolutely.  People are going to see you walk in, and you're flushing every two seconds.  Wow, he must have ate something really bad.  Don't eat the shrimp in first class. 
[01:29:30]  Terrible, man.  I'm addicted to that nicotine, man.  That's the worst drug of them all.  Are you still smoking?  No, I quit about eight, nine years ago now.  I went on the gum for about three years, and then I went on the patch to get off the gum.  Wow, you were addicted to the gum?  Oh, it was very good, man.  Yeah.  Well, it's straight stuff.  Yeah.  It's straight nicotine.  You don't have to go through all the smoke to get to the drug.  I've talked to people that, like, yeah, they get addicted to the gum.  It gives you a nice little tingle. 
[01:30:00]  Tingle, gives you a rush, makes you feel good.  It's like Vicodin.  It tastes like pepper, though.  There's always, I could never chew the, the patch is how I finally quit, but I could never  chew the gum.  That feeling that, like, that inhale.  I know, but the thing about the gum was it was like a pack of cigarettes, because you  could pull it out of your pocket, you could open it, you can, you literally, it's like  packing a cigarette, and you put it in your mouth.  All the physical and oral, you know, gratification. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  I would love to smoke right now as we're saying this.  I've been quitting.  You know what, I went back to this.  I smoke one cigar a week now.  Yeah.  Cigars for some reason.  After the show, we film the show, I sit down, and I have a cigar.  Well, we got Jimmy to quit cold turkey.  Yeah, I did the patch.  We just, I had to quit.  Because of a radio bit we were doing, yeah.  Yeah, we had people in.  Big sacrifices for comedy, my friend.  Well, we had a big, it was supposed to be comedy.  It was called, what the hell is that?  What the hell is that? 
[01:31:00]  So basically, we got a couple doctors, and then people from our audience would come in  with whatever they had.  Anyone off the street would say, come on up.  If you got something you want checked out, we got two doctors.  And we had a third guy who probably wasn't a doctor.  We should have a doctor in here.  We had a third guy who we think was just, like, kind of BSing.  He wasn't really a doctor.  Yeah, he just wanted to hope.  He was hoping some attractive girl would come in with a gynecological problem.  He had a white coat.  He had any stirrups.  I like that.  Yeah.  So we had guys, like, one guy, he would only sweat on half his face when he ate spicy food. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, so we got a bunch of chicken wings, hot wings, and he would sweat completely  down the middle of his face on one side.  And that turned out to be a serious neurological problem that he had to have checked out.  Yeah.  And other people with things that went wrong with their legs and stuff.  But one guy said, I got this growth on my gum, one of my gums.  And doctor went in there, put the gloves on, and he's feeling around.  He's kind of looking up.  You know, they do that when they're feeling around.  And then he looks at us, and his eyes got real wide, and he kind of went, like, he 
[01:32:00]  mouthed, uh-oh.  And we're like, okay, what's going on?  One doctor tapped out.  He's like, I don't want to do this anymore.  And the other guy gave us the big C.  And the other guy, like, you know how you do the YMCA?  You do YMCA.  He did the C to us.  Oh, no.  And we're like, uh-oh.  That's terrible.  And all the laughs turned to tears.  Yeah, it was like that.  That's terrible.  And Jimmy describes what he saw in the guy's eyes.  Well, what got me was the way, when he knew that there was something wrong, and they're 
[01:32:30]  like, we just suggest you go get checked.  You know how doctors will never just say that.  Right, right, right, right.  Oh, there's a specialist I know.  Yeah, yeah, go get checked.  But he knew what they were telling him.  And he was like, all right, where do I go?  What should I do?  I was watching this guy trying to hold on to his sanity.  Like, he was panicking, and he was trying not to panic.  And I'm like, that is what it finds.  That's exactly what it looks like when someone tells you that you have cancer in the mouth.  That's what happens.  That stupid, simple interaction.  And it was too close right there.  And right then and there, Jimmy was like, boom.  I'm done.  One little window of clarity. 
[01:33:00]  So I had one more.  I was going to smoke my pack, and then Anthony just berated me.  He's like, just put your arm out.  I went away.  Just throw him away.  And then the guy didn't have cancer.  He called back a month later.  Yeah, it has a happy ending.  Yeah.  Oh, so you can go back now.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm happy to smoke, of course.  Oh, now this is a happy ending.  I smoke.  I threw out my condoms.  How long is it courting to Jimmy on the air?  You've been on the air for a while.  Well, we're shooting our sixth season.  Sixth.  Wow.  We're in syndication.  We started this fall. 
[01:33:30]  We're on five nights a week all over the country.  Wow.  And in Chicago on WGN.  If you're driving on the I-94.  Oh, yeah.  WGN.  Yeah, WGN.  Sure.  You've got to be out for five years for syndication.  Is that the way it goes?  They'd like to have like 80 to 100 shows, and we're up to about 140.  Wow.  Nice.  Yeah, it's a great stack of comedy, man.  And we had to do a clip show, and trying to find the best clips, you know, over 125 shows.  It was like impossible.  It was like we realized, man, we've done a lot of comedies. 
[01:34:00]  Like you guys, you've done hours and hours and hours, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a stack of comedy.  Yeah, yeah.  And the great news is that we get to show it again and again and again, and it's doing  very well.  And here in WPIX in New York, it's doing very well.  Right.  It's syndication money, too.  That's the way to go.  Once you get into syndication, you're set for $30 million.  Oh, man.  The money is always great.  But as an actor, you know, as an actor, it's the work.  And it's a pile of work, and it's been a great six years of work.  And it can keep me really satisfied creatively and, you know, as an artist. 
[01:34:30]  That's awesome.  And also at home.  So it's cool.  You had a crawl out from under the shadow of your brother years ago.  It was always, you know, oh, it's Jim Belushi.  Yeah.  Yeah, John's brother.  I didn't know that.  No, you did.  You absolutely did.  No jerks would say that except for you.  You and Paul R. Nelson.  I never said it.  You under the shadow of Paul R. Nelson.  There was always – it's actually – it would just be very hard for anybody to come 
[01:35:00]  out of such a strong personality as your brother and then come out and do that.  Obviously, you had a career going for yourself, but there was always that comparison.  At least people I talk to, no one said it to you.  No one's ever – you never heard an inkling of that.  This is the first time.  Because I'm now throwing out the compliment that you've completely, like, overcome that  where I don't even hear it anymore.  It's not like one of those things that you hear anymore. 
[01:35:30]  See, this had a happy ending, Jim.  He's going to punch in it.  I thought he was giving me a big, like –  No, no, no.  You know who gave me that question?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  Jesus Christ, I'm in a hole.  Help me out here.  You've got to help me out here, Hendry.  You were squirming, man.  When you have a very famous and legendary older brother – I mean, it was your older brother,  right?  Yes.  And, you know what I mean, especially with – he dies the way – it's just a very hard  thing to – you know what I mean?  Because he was already famous by the time you came up.  It's just a difficult thing to all of a sudden break out and go, no, no, I'm a different  person, same last name. 
[01:36:00]  And, you know, you certainly have done it.  Well, you know, it's difficult – it's difficult being a performer or an actor in general.  So to have a famous brother is – and John wasn't just, like, famous, you know.  It's not like a Quaid brothers or, you know, Murray brothers or something.  I mean, John was, like, huge.  He was an icon, yeah.  You know, he was – I was a fan.  Yeah.  You know, I looked at him as separate from me, just like you guys did.  And for what we do, he was the man. 
[01:36:30]  Worldwide, man.  But, I mean, for us, for actors and comedians, you know, he was like – you know, he did  Second City, he did Saturday Night Live, he did those movies.  So I've always felt kind of separate from him, just like another actor trying to move  along.  But he was just such an incredible talent that there – I think the shadow went over all  of us, you know, to try to reach that kind of standard, you know.  Yeah.  So it was difficult in the sense that it's just like – I don't think about it, but 
[01:37:00]  you think about it.  All the time.  So the only time it's difficult is, like, when other people, you know, go into it.  It's like, oh, yeah, I forgot about that, so I've got to go into it.  Maybe I just think of it in terms of if, God forbid, anything ever happened to me, my  brother trying to do radio.  And –  See, now it's heavy.  I –  We're getting heavy again.  Let me check your gums for a second.  We have to take a break. 
[01:37:30]  Do we have you for a little longer or you've got to go?  Sure, whatever you want, man.  I'm enjoying this.  Really?  Do you want to hang out for a little bit?  Sure.  Whatever you want.  We've got Sharon Osborne.  There's not comments I made.  Oh, I don't want to hold her up.  No, she's not here.  She's not here.  We can do a few more minutes with you because we've got to talk about your book.  Oh, yeah, whatever.  It's Real Men Don't Apologize by Jim Belushi.  We'll get into that a little bit after the break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the ONA.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.

[01:39:30]  Texans.  No.  I don't care.  That's your pick.  And then the Jaguars or the Eagles?  Well, I got to pull for the Eagles.  All right.  There you go.  Very smart.  Yeah, I got to pull for the Eagles.  All of Philly is listening to you right now.  Hey, I hit them all.  A big hug to everyone listening to us on WYSP.  YSP.  There you go.  All right.  The book, Real Men Don't Apologize.  Yes.  We got to get the plug in here.  What's that about?  It's a very funny book about the differences between men and women.  You know, just some good jokes and actually some great insights on relationships, you know, 
[01:40:00]  that we try to use on According to Jim.  It's really kind of an extension of According to Jim, except for a little dirtier.  Yeah.  You know, not Lucky Louie dirty, but, you know.  Well, Lucky Louie dirty apparently wasn't good because you're still on the air and we're not.  According to Jim Clean.  Big mistake.  Better than Lucky Louie dirty.  Big mistake, I'm telling you.  Critics hated our guts.  Really?  Yeah, they hated us, dude.  I want to critic snowman.  I know.  They should have brought it back. 
[01:40:30]  You should have brought it back.  I'd love to say I don't read reviews, but I read every one like a little fat-necked frog.  I was just perusing every one.  I don't read any of them.  You really don't want to hear them?  I don't read them because they just don't make a difference anymore.  But did you read them in the beginning?  I think everyone that gets in the show bids.  When I was in the theater, it's a big deal.  A review in the theater is a big deal because that sells tickets in the theater.  I don't think reviews sell viewers on TV or film anymore.  I still think it does in theater, especially here in New York. 
[01:41:00]  A plug for my son's play in Chicago.  He got great reviews, so that ought to do well.  What play is it?  It's called This Is Our Youth.  You don't think a critic could smash a film these days?  Critics can kind of – I think they have more influence over films than TV.  I don't think they have any influence over TV.  They have more influence over film than TV because you're still spending money.  Yeah.  But for the majority of people that go to movies, they go because they want to go. 
[01:41:30]  They go because they want to take a date or it looks cute or she's cute.  Yeah.  That's a cool story.  Look at that clip.  I mean, those clips mean more to the viewer than the articles because after a while,  these guys have been writing reviews for so long, and the critics that we read now have  been doing it for years and years.  They get isolated and isolated and more and more in a vacuum, and they really lose touch  with, I think, what's going on in America.  They're just awful.  So I thought it was great to have Kevin Smith sitting in for Ebert. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Ebert is probably the single best critic in America because the one thing about Ebert  is that he still loves movies.  Chicago's own.  Yes.  Yes.  Of course.  He loves –  Needless to say, Opie.  He loves –  We're watching you, Chicago.  He loves his job.  He doesn't want to do anything else but that.  Other critics always feel like they don't like their job.  They'd rather have been doing something else.  Been an actor.  Something.  There's always this kind of sense of this mean bitterness. 
[01:42:30]  That's how it is with the sports columnists.  You read the columns, especially in the New York Papers, and you want to call these guys  up and go, why are you even watching sports at this point?  You hate everything about it.  Well, that's the other thing is you don't read anything that – anything that you read  or watch on TV that's positive, you change the channel because we're just a dramatic  society now.  We just want the drama.  We want the negative stuff, and that's what feeds.  So I don't read.  I don't read those great –  Hey, we've got to jump in here.  John Mayer, he's calling us from Dubai. 
[01:43:00]  Dubai.  Dubai.  How are you?  Dubai.  John, we've got Jim Belushi in studio.  Hello, sir.  Hey, man.  How are you doing?  I'm doing all right.  How about you?  What are you doing in Dubai?  I'm good.  Well, we flew out here to do one gig.  One gig.  One gig.  One gig.  Is it corporate?  It seems to be kind of almost – well, I guess there's a promoter out here who kind  of makes Dubai a new place to go play shows.  Hey, is that where Michael Jackson is?  I know that's where he kind of took off to, yeah.  Like Tiger Woods goes there to play in a tournament every year now. 
[01:43:30]  Is that the one –  It's blown up like Vegas.  Is that the one that's been in Dubai?  Like an island off of India, that one?  They're building – it's one of these places where they just don't take the actual – they  don't take Mother Nature.  They don't take – they just go against it, and they're actually dumping sand in the  water and trying to build land.  Make it bigger?  Yeah.  It's really interesting.  Oh, I've heard about that.  We've actually – I do the Blues Brothers with Danny.  We had an offer to go over there.  That's a long flight, though, huh?  It must be. 
[01:44:00]  Well, you know, the only thing about traveling worldwide that's cool is that it's been – it  was a five-hour flight because we came from London, so we're kind of just splitting  it up.  Oh, that's cool.  Well, that's not bad.  How was your tour, man, with Sheryl Crow?  It was great.  It was really great.  You know, I mean, Sheryl and I are kind of similar because we get this rap as being  kind of like soft rock, soccer mom kind of stuff, but –  Hockey dad.  What's that?  Nothing.  Hockey dad is a callback.  Political advert.  Hockey dad, right.  Yeah.  But, you know, like, she can – she's pretty badass.  I mean, she's more rock than most bands with guys in it. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, yeah, she is.  She's cool, man.  She really does rock.  No, she's cool, and she's –  She could – yeah, she can – she can out-party most guys, I'll tell you that.  When are you coming back, man?  Because this is really great at the comedy show when John comes in and says, well, the  chicks – chicks are never – the chicks under 400 pounds are never around the comedian's  table, except when he's sitting there, all these hot young girls will come over, and  he's like a team player.  He'll always try to pass them off to his friends.  John's a good boy.  Oh, what a guy.  There you go.  Well, thank you.  You know, I don't know if that's on the books for me anymore. 
[01:45:00]  You know, I had some time off.  For me, it's like I get such little time off that's not music-related that I almost  purposely choose something as different as possible, and I've always wanted to do the  stand-up thing.  I'm not very good at it at all, but for me, the moment I stood on stage was kind of a  goal because most people always talk about doing stand-up and don't actually get up  there, so I kind of felt good.  So you have like a routine?  You have like 20 minutes, 30 minutes?  No.  I just love getting my ass kicked.  I love thinking that I have 15 minutes and having four, and one of those are good. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, he just goes up there and kind of goes with it.  He was funny, though, because he was kind of like belligerent to the wants of the audience,  which I loved.  It was more like just doing the stuff he wanted to do, some racial stuff, some relationship  stuff, whatever it was, but just not caring if the audience went with it or not, which  I just – I love that.  Oh, thank you.  And you're not doing the comedy because the CD's doing very well there, John.  No, it's doing – it's –  It's doing extremely well.  The weird thing is the CD comes – this is the way it always works.  The CD comes out, and you think you're going to be around to get a sense of what's going 
[01:46:00]  on, and then you leave the country.  So I've been out of the country for almost a month now, so – not a month, two or three  weeks.  Oh, so they're burning your CDs in stadiums.  Yeah.  Horrible thing.  Wow, you've been away.  Yeah, they're piling them up.  Come back, John.  I know something happened.  John, two words.  Jessica Simpson, what can you tell us?  What can I tell you?  We need to know.  Come on.  All right.  We feel like we know you a little bit.  Give us something.  Give us something.  I'd like you – well, how do I tell you more without telling you anything? 
[01:46:30]  Let me figure that.  No, I mean, the bottom line is that my fans don't – I'm really concerned that my fans  don't ever feel like they've lost me, because third record in, start to get used to some  things.  That's always a time when my favorite artists kind of go south, and they do something completely  ridiculous, and I go, oh, there we go.  Let's start looking in the new releases again and find something cool to listen to.  So my thing is that I don't ever want anyone to think that I'm manipulating them or changing  the way I always do things, because the way I always do things has been exactly the same.  It's just – it kind of went down the way you read it. 
[01:47:00]  It was like, you know, whatever I –  He is saying a lot without saying –  That could be –  I'm reading between the lines there.  Yeah, yeah.  He banged Jessica Simpson.  It was great, but he wants his fans to think that he dates ugly girls.  All right.  Wow, is that what you pulled out of that?  Yeah.  Anyone else?  That was pretty good, John.  That was pretty good.  Jim, I got that – I think there's a song coming out of that rap that he just gave  us.  Yeah.  He's going to write a hit song.  It's called Everything But. 
[01:47:30]  Sweet Girl, Crazy World.  How about that?  All right.  That's a good title.  Sweet Girl, Crazy World.  Do you think she kind of has an affection for you?  Because there's a lovely photo of you.  That's not a bad rumor to have floating around.  Yeah, man.  I would be running with that rumor.  No problem.  You almost feel like releasing a press release thing.  Please give me privacy in this troubling time of beautiful women.  I mean, everything is – the bottom line is everything is cool.  You know, I mean, my only thing is for me to have the maximum effect as a musician, 
[01:48:00]  I don't want everyone to know everything about me.  Yeah, but between you and Dane Cook, one of you guys got some of that.  One of you guys has to.  And we need to know which one.  Because that's our world.  I'll tell you what.  If you can get Dane Cook on the line, we'll figure it out.  No, the Sweet Girl, Crazy – I mean, that world is really –  He ain't talking.  A funny crazy.  Jimmy ain't talking.  He won't tell us.  Yeah, it's all right, man.  All right.  Come on.  He has a right to protect the girl.  So, all right, John.  John's saying hi from Dubai.  Continuum is really great, dude. 
[01:48:30]  Absolutely.  I love it.  Hey, good luck with the gig there, man.  Let me know how it works out, because we've been invited to go.  Yeah, really fast, John.  What kind of gig in Dubai?  Like a casino gig, right?  But, I mean, who are you playing to?  Like the Sheik's kids or something?  Yeah, I don't – well, I don't know.  I think they're just trying to really – just like everything else in the country,  they're trying to just get things started.  So, I think they've got an artist from each continent, and they're doing some really  big festivals tonight.  And I think they're almost kind of aware that it's not that heavily attended, but  they're just trying to get it started. 
[01:49:00]  Right.  The Middle East doesn't really have a reputation for a fun party.  You know, they're letting loose.  Everybody's having a fake –  A lot of prayer.  A lot of prayer in between songs.  Yeah.  Right.  They monitor everything over here.  So, I just want to tell you that Dubai is great.  Oh, there you go.  Lovely, lovely, lovely.  Yeah, no, I've heard it's a lovely place.  Nice.  And, you know, and you're not Jewish.  All right, take care.  All right, John, we've got to fly.  We're real busy today.  Please call us and let us know how the gig went.  Thank you, guys.  I will. 
[01:49:30]  All right.  Take care, John.  Take care, Jim.  Bye, buddy.  John Mayer, live from Dubai.  Dubai.  Dubai.  He's cool, man.  Yeah, John's cool.  We've had him on the show.  Yeah.  He's friends with Jim Norton.  Yep.  They see each other from time to time.  All right, we've got to get Sharon Osbourne in here.  Jim.  Gentlemen.  It's been a pleasure.  Please come back and see us.  Thank you very much for your time.  I really enjoyed being on the show today.  It's called Real Men Don't Apologize.  I guess it's in stores now, right?  It's in stores.  It's online.  And according to the gym, it's on five nights a week.  And yeah, continued success with that, man. 
[01:50:00]  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  You're still a very down-to-earth fellow.  Well, well, I'm trying to get off the earth, man.  I'm trying.  But, you know, I don't do anything anymore to take me anywhere.  All right, you're a great guy, man.  Thank you, guys.  Have a good run.  All right, it's Jim Belushi, everyone.  Sharon Osbourne, when we get back, it's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Jim Norton will be appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman, Wednesday, November 1st.  Check local listings for Showtime.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Fast-paced show today. 
[01:50:30]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We've got Sharon Osbourne in studio smelling really, really good.  Unbelievably good.  That's the first thing we said to her.  You smell good.  We're losers.  We really are.  When it comes down to it.  Is her mic on?  Make sure Sharon's mic is on.  Yeah, I cranked it up there.  Is it on?  Yeah, there you go.  Well, she's very soft-spoken.  I'm used to the Sharon Osbourne from, you know, the show, where you're yelling and screaming  at everybody.  I'm still yelling and screaming. 
[01:51:00]  Just causing havoc wherever you go.  And then you come in and you're very soft-spoken and you smell nice and you look beautiful.  You better hope it stays that way.  What?  I'm not going to do anything wrong.  I'm just saying, like, the reason she's soft-spoken is because usually if she's yelling,  she has a reason to.  Oh.  So we don't want to get a reason.  Is that our goal, to get her to scream at us?  No, not mine.  It would be fun to get yelled at by her.  No, it's too early in the morning.  Yeah.  Come on.  Be nice.  I met Sharon one time.  I was backstage at OzFest.  Of course you were.  Of course.  I had to be. 
[01:51:30]  And I was nervous meeting you because, you know, I guess people who have been on the other  end of business deals with you that weren't doing what you like have stories that you  don't F around.  And I was kind of nervous.  I'm like, I don't want to say the wrong thing and piss her off.  And you were so nice.  Look at the lovely hug you gave me.  You couldn't have enjoyed that hug.  Oh, look.  Jimmy brought his picture.  Yeah, she was very sweet.  We should tell Sharon that you're looking at the biggest Ozzy fan of all time.  And I'm sure you've heard that a lot.  But I'm telling you, he's obsessed.  He's almost a stalker. 
[01:52:00]  No.  Almost a stalker.  When Ozzy was on our show, he couldn't speak.  He was looking forward to this for so long.  And he just turned into a blithering idiot.  Well, for the first 10 minutes, I just sat there and we were at the XM side and Ozzy's  on my right.  And Anthony is great because he can just conduct an interview.  And I'm such a just a stalker, like ass.  And Ozzy's talking and I'm like, hey dope, Ozzy is sitting next to you.  We at least talked to him.  And then I started talking.  He hung for like 45 minutes.  And then it worked out okay. 
[01:52:30]  I just kind of loosened up.  But yeah, I was nervous.  You're a little nervous.  So cute.  He turned into a little kid.  But Ozzy is so unique.  He's so different.  Oh, yeah.  And he's hilarious.  Easy to talk to.  You guys talk to, you know, a zillion people in a day.  But yet when he comes in, everything about him, his body language, everything, he is so  unique.  And the best thing was it was over there.  So he could talk in his inimitable Ozzy style without any restrictions.  Yeah, no bleepings. 
[01:53:00]  So what's he doing?  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Quite the potty mouth we all know.  But he loved it though.  Tony Dennis said that he had a great time because he could curse.  He didn't have to worry about like, you know, just dancing around words.  He just said what he wanted to say.  Jimmy doesn't acknowledge that another band existed.  We try to talk music on the show.  It's all about Black Sabbath.  And you try to bring up, God forbid you bring up Zeppelin or something.  Excuse me, he has good taste.  Well, yeah, I'm trying to get her on my side.  I'm an idiot.  I don't think you have to sell her on Ozzy.  Yeah.  Good point.  I wanted to ask you too. 
[01:53:30]  Obviously, this really irritated me that there was at OzFest that, and I loved you for doing  this, Iron Maiden, like Dickinson had been bad-mouthing Sabbath.  I mean, was he actually bad-mouthing the band?  Because I know it got really ugly between the two bands.  He was bad-mouthing.  I mean, come on, these guys, you know, are English.  We've, you know, we've crossed paths over the years for like 20-odd years.  And he came on.  We paid them a fortune to come on.  We were, you know, really nice with them, gave them whatever they wanted.  And every single night, not Sabbath, but Ozzy, he took pot shots at Ozzy on stage. 
[01:54:00]  And at first, Ozzy and I thought it was a joke.  So, you know, you, you know how guys, you know, you joke with each other.  And we're like, okay, he's joking.  And it went on and went on and on.  And I just thought, okay, carry on.  You want to play, you pay.  Nice.  And so when they got to L.A., which is like, you know, oh, L.A.  and there's 50-odd thousand kids there.  And I thought, right, payback. 
[01:54:30]  And so I had, I had like 20 guys in the front with eggs,  great big jars of peanut butter mixed in with dog food, milk to make it really wet, everything.  And they pelted him.  And I thought, you know what, kid?  Laugh at that.  You know, you don't, you don't take somebody's money and take their stage and then be discourteous.  To me, that just doesn't, it just doesn't go. 
[01:55:00]  You know, if you've got something to say about someone you're working with, say it, get it over with, move on.  I heard the rest of the band was embarrassed, too.  I mean, they said, I think, I think I asked Tony Omi one time.  And he said that the rest of the band was kind of coming up going, look, that's not, that's him.  The other guys, I must say, were very, very nice, great guys, you know.  But that singer has a problem.  He has a real big problem.  Very big, you know, inflated ego.  And he just, you know, is discourteous. 
[01:55:30]  But he got it back.  I was at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.  I hijacked the press conference.  Because these dumb reporters are just going to ask stupid reporter questions.  Oh, I know.  And I sat in the second row.  And my goal was to, like, talk to Sabbath and ask questions and get a photo while I was talking to them.  So I stand up when they come out.  And I'm asking questions.  I'm, like, trying to angle and get a picture.  And all these dumb reporters are yelling, sit down, sir.  Could you sit down?  Could you sit down?  And you're like, no, I'm on my picture.  They just didn't exist.  And it was great asking them real fan questions. 
[01:56:00]  All these idiots want to know about is the next album and some stupid bat joke.  They're just a bunch of scumbags, these, you know, like, Rolling Stone magazine type of critic vibe.  It really irritated me.  And I don't know where I'm going with this.  I just wanted to tell you.  Just showing that you are pretty much a stalker.  No, I've never done anything unhealthy.  I've never showed up someplace I shouldn't.  I don't hang outside the fence and peek in.  It was the greatest photo you ever got because you got the whole band.  That was his goal.  He set it up for weeks.  We had to hear about it. 
[01:56:30]  He planned it perfectly and it worked out for him.  And it's not, do you know what, it's not that easy to get them all together and do a photo with them.  You know, it's so rare that they are all together at one time.  And, you know, the one thing, you know, I mean, how great is it's the only band from that era that's all still alive and still can play great.  I went back.  I snuck back after the interview and I talked to Ozzy for a second.  And I'm like, I'd like to get a picture with the band.  He's like, sure, man. 
[01:57:00]  You know, relaxed he is.  But the other band, the band was still signing and he had to go.  So he's walking away.  And then I only comes out and I had met him that day.  I'm like, I want to get a picture.  So he's like, hey, Ozzy, let's just do the picture.  So it's him, Ozzy, it's Tony, it's me, and then it's Geezer.  And then Bill is just taking his time.  And Bill starts walking out.  I'm like, Bill, hurry up.  Come on, come on.  And he runs.  Bill runs over and he looks like, who are you?  Why am I running for you?  He just realized that there's nobody.  There's this legendary band with their trophies and me and I'm hustling Bill Ward along. 
[01:57:30]  Come on, come on.  We're going to get a picture.  I screamed at him.  I'm like, Bill, come on.  And he just ran.  Jimmy has given us hours of joy over his obsession with Black Sabbath and Ozzy.  Obsessed.  Yeah.  And he even says he even says how much he liked the Ozzy with the big poofy hair.  Yeah.  Back in the day.  It was kind of a...  Back in the day.  It wasn't looking.  Even Sharon didn't like that period.  Listen, believe me, I get so much grief from my kids when they look at those pictures  and go, Mom, what did you do to that?  Didn't let him out of the house like that. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  How dare you?  The shot in the dark.  Yeah.  The black painted fingernails and toenails.  Yeah.  I mean, it was all right.  It was...  Hey, look, it was right after...  It was like the hairband vibe.  You had to do what you had to do.  Oh, by the way, here is the picture that Jimmy got that night.  Come on.  I want to...  There it is.  I mean, you want to talk about that?  Is that a great shot, though?  That's fantastic.  Is that a beautiful picture?  Like, what are the odds you're going to get in a picture like that unless you're, you  know, close to the band or stalking them or have guns pointed at them?  They're all holding their trophies. 
[01:58:30]  It couldn't be better.  Now, the next thing is you've got to get it signed.  I was going to try that.  I actually...  When you guys were at the rock and roll, you had the hard rock promoting your charity.  Of course, self-centered ass I am.  I'm not thinking about the charity.  I'm not thinking about doing good.  I'm like, could you get the picture signed?  But it was impossible.  You are a self-centered ass.  You're going to have to wait until...  When is it?  2008, until they do their 40th anniversary tour, and then they'll come in and sign it.  That's fine.  We'll wait.  Oh.  Yeah, we can wait.  I blew that up.  I have a copy of that on my wall.  It's obnoxious.  I know. 
[01:59:00]  I love watching Jim.  Do you know how big I blew it up?  I'm embarrassed.  I'm 38 years old.  Do you see these squares on the wall?  Yeah.  That's how big it is on my wall.  I have to bring women over and explain why a grown man...  That's you.  Sharon, I hope you understand.  He's a very successful comic.  He was on Lucky Louie on HBO.  His career is going very well.  He comes on stage in front of massive audience to some Black Sabbath music.  Oh, yeah, I walk on to A National Acrobat is the wall.  Even though he's wearing a KISS shirt today, I'm sorry about that.  I had to.  It would have been too wormy if I showed up in an Aussie shirt and pointed.  Hi, Sharon. 
[01:59:30]  See, you even thought about that today.  I certainly did.  My wardrobe.  He's always thinking.  And I told Sharon when she walked in, I'm reading the book.  And I'm not, you know, I really want to read it because I'm very interested.  And it's really, it's...  The first thing, the most amazing thing I learned so far is that Aussie is a morning person.  I had no idea he actually gets up early and enjoys getting up early.  You would never actually think that.  Like, watching, you'd feel like he probably slept all day.  It's the weirdest thing.  He opens his eyes and then, boom, he's out of bed.  He doesn't, like, you know, stretch and, you know, a little chat.  Literally, up, eyes open, gone. 
[02:00:00]  You know, in the shower.  I'm like, how do you do that?  You know, like, relax five minutes and then get up.  No, gone.  And he's, you know, roaming around 6.37 every day.  And it seems already like...  I think that I have to do that.  The book is already getting...  It's really honest.  And Sharon, when she walked in, we talked about it.  But I love the fact that your show and the Osbournes was...  It wasn't surface honest.  It wasn't like, oh, we had an argument once.  I mean, it was...  It got into you being sick and it got into Aussies.  It got into, like, really heavy, like, family things. 
[02:00:30]  Was there anything that you guys, like, revealed that you kind of wished you didn't reveal?  No, because I think that's what makes us kind of different.  You know, not only was Ozzy the first celebrity to actually, you know, let cameras into his home.  But, you know, he's so honest.  He's incapable of being, you know, oh, let's set up this idea and let's set up that.  You know, Ozzy can't do that.  He's incapable of doing that.  And so everything you saw is, you know, natural and organic and, you know, it's pure. 
[02:01:00]  And I think that's what sets it aside from everybody else that's trying to do it.  I know.  You watch any of those shows now and it's like, oh, stop.  That's so badly acted.  I know.  It's like, what made you think you were an actor?  I know.  That you can script this out and make it look legit.  You know, it gets embarrassing with some of them.  You kind of get, like...  You know when you get, like, sweaty under the arm?  You can't watch if there's other people in the room, you can't look at each other.  I get embarrassed.  We call that the douche chill.  Yeah, you do.  It's the worst. 
[02:01:30]  But he's, you know, we don't regret anything.  You can't.  Do you miss it, though?  Do you miss taping the show and all that and having all those people around?  I miss the family being together.  You know, right before it ended, it was the time that the kids were actually, you know, moving out.  So it was a huge life change for Ozzy and I, you know, to have that house.  That's odd that you're really, like, I don't think the viewer really put it in that perspective.  Like, wow, you're watching your kids grow up to the point where they're ready to leave the nest and that's it, you know?  And it's really strange, you know, to come in and you're used to having kids coming in and out all night long and, you know, and then suddenly there's nothing. 
[02:02:00]  And you go home and there's Ozzy and I sat at a big table having dinner and we say, oh, let's go have it on the tray in the kitchen.  And we go back in the kitchen and it's us, you know?  I mean, it's great.  It's just a new chapter of your life, you know?  It's very different.  Yeah.  Been a big adjustment or?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  You know, I keep going over to my kids' homes and buying them ridiculous things for the house. 
[02:02:30]  Excuse to go there.  I must love that.  No, they don't.  It's like, oh, please, would you stop it?  You're smothering me.  I'm like, I'm sorry.  Is it things that they need or just kind of things that you like and, like, give them, like?  Things that I think they need and I like and I take it there and they're like, thanks, Mom.  You know, like I take over a big pink fluffy cushion to Jack's house.  Thanks, Mom.  You know, as soon as I go, it's in, like, the covers.  Give it to a girl. 
[02:03:00]  Like, look, I got you.  Yeah, you know that.  Check your house.  Wow.  I wanted to ask you something else, too.  I'm so annoyed.  About the book?  Come on.  No, it wasn't about the book.  It was about something that wasn't the book.  God, I'm so stupid.  I love the book, though.  I'm very happy.  I'm very nervous talking about Sarah.  I just like watching you squirm.  I love you.  Look at her shoulders.  They're like this.  After the other day, I'm loving this, Jimmy.  I've never seen Jimmy with his shoulders way up like that.  They're all hunched off.  He's, like, all tense.  Just talking to my friend Sharon. 
[02:03:30]  What's wrong with that?  I happen to love her husband, but, you know, so what?  I like her, too.  The fact is, this is what bugs me.  A lot of people don't understand that Sharon, and I'm not saying this just because you're here,  you, I mean, Ozzy's talent is responsible for a lot of it, but you're responsible for,  you made Ozzy, you kept him relevant through so many tough periods of music,  like, all through the hair bands, all through grunge.  Oh, the grunge.  Don't remind me of the grunge.  Jeez.  But he stayed.  He did.  And Ozfest.  How close was it to getting him to wear flannel? 
[02:04:00]  Well, did you think about it?  Never, ever, ever.  You know, they don't do flannel in black.  Right, right, right.  And you couldn't see Ozzy in check.  You were able to get his hair poofy.  I was just thinking, maybe a flannel.  No, no, that would be pushing it to extreme there.  No, I could never do that.  I mean, can you imagine Ozzy in short, those short trousers and coming in with a check.  The jams on, and yeah.  Give me a break.  What did you think of the grunge movement?  Um, you know. 
[02:04:30]  It's better than the hair bands.  Better than the hair bands.  You know, love Nirvana, love Pearl Jam, and then I can't remember anyone else.  Alice in Chains?  Alice in Chains, yeah, you're right.  Love them.  My son's favorite band.  I mean, we love them.  We're trying to get them on Ozfest next year.  Oh, with the new, uh, the new Sarah?  No, with the old 180s.  Actually, what the hell do you think?  We're going to dig him up.  Yeah, right.  They're playing, uh, Philadelphia tonight.  I might go down there and check it out. 
[02:05:00]  The Electric Factory.  I'm hearing nothing but great things about this new singer.  They're really great.  Yeah.  Hey, did you and your dad, I know your dad, Don Arden, had managed Black Sabbath, and I  don't know if that's how you met Ozzy or not, um, but did you guys, I know, had, like,  a lot of, uh, conflict over when you started to manage him, right?  Yeah, a lot of, a lot of conflict because, um,  when I started a relationship with Ozzy and, and my dad knew that we were going to  get married, he knew that it was time for me to go, and I would go, and I would take 
[02:05:30]  Ozzy, which means his financial, you know, state would be affected because he wouldn't  have Ozzy anymore.  And my dad, you know, it's not like, oh, my daughter's married.  Fantastic.  It's like, you know, stay, I want the money, don't go.  And it was, everything's about money.  Well, it was about money with my father.  And did it ever, like, get resolved, or did you, did you end everything on bad terms?  No, it was horrible.  He, he never saw my children.  My mother never saw my children, my brother. 
[02:06:00]  And, and, but eventually I heard that my father was sick.  And so, um, five years ago, I, four, four or five years ago, I, I met with my father and  I take care of him now.  He's old.  Oh, he's still alive?  I don't know why I thought he passed away.  Okay.  No, he's still alive.  He's 80.  Wow.  I put so, so things are a little bit better at least.  Well, he has old time and so he doesn't know who I am and I, but I take care of him, you  know, you, you, um, you have to forgive, but you don't forget, you know, you can't, you 
[02:06:30]  can't go through life holding all that, you know, you've got to let it go.  Is it tough being, I mean, I mean, I've just, you've been asked this a million times, but  to be a wife and a manager, I mean, it's like, I mean, you're, it's just, it's constantly  together.  It's everything is together.  Is there any like times where you just like, you wish you weren't the manager?  I mean, obviously you want to be married.  Sure.  I mean, very, very tough.  Excuse me.  Are you watching porn on there?  No.  Oh, I thought she was covering herself with that. 
[02:07:00]  You know what?  She's, she's spilling out her heart.  I'm not going to have porn on there.  No.  Okay.  No, no, no, no.  She's reaching deep for us and then she might be watching porn.  I took down any, anybody that might've been, uh, doing anything.  These are our listeners, a few of them and they pop up, they can see us.  We can see them.  They watch on count.  Very interactive.  Okay.  And they comment on what's going on on the show and ask questions, things like that.  Sorry.  No, no, no.  Because it, you know, any other day you'd be right.  It would have been some nude girl up there, but I'm being respectful. 
[02:07:30]  Not today.  It's going back to your question.  It's, it's very hard at certain times when you, you know, you want your artist to do something, but you don't want your husband to do it.  And, but it's all one.  So it's, it, there were very hard times at certain points.  It's, you know, certain points when I say in the book when Ozzy wasn't well, but he had to go on stage and I made him.  And, you know, you feel so bad, you know, what do you do? 
[02:08:00]  It's like nine o'clock at night.  The audience have been there all day.  There's thousands of kids.  And if anyone would go on stage and say, well, actually you can go home now because he's not performing, he's not well, it would have been riot.  People would get hurt.  So you weigh it up.  What do you do?  What do you do?  I don't think you had a choice.  You've taken a huge amount of heat for that though.  Huge.  From people.  Yeah.  That have just said, oh, look, she's, you know, throwing them out on stage and, and the poor guy didn't feel well. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, what do you do?  Because I've, I've been there.  I've done it.  We've canceled shows on the day.  And, you know, kids don't like it.  And they've been out in the sun all day.  They've been drinking and they, you know, they paid, they paid their money.  They want to see them.  And, you know, it gets pretty ugly those times.  But we don't have to do that anymore.  Is this my husband's well?  Was the small stage a nice switch?  I was so irritated.  I was away doing gigs.  I missed the small stage performance.  That must have been a great change. 
[02:09:00]  It was amazing.  It was so fantastic.  Ozzy's going to do it again next year.  Oh, good.  Loved, loved being out there at like four in the afternoon.  And, you know, just, he, he was so happy doing it.  Home by seven o'clock.  Oh, luxury.  How disgusted were, I know, and don't blame me.  You were talking about Cardinal O'Connor and all these, these devil accusations and all  that stuff.  That stuff seems to have kind of like faded away over the years, like all that nonsense  around him.  I think, you think it's since the show that like all those dumb rumors that would circulate 
[02:09:30]  just kind of like, eh, kind of fell by the wayside and people don't.  Yeah, I mean, um, middle America people that didn't understand the genre of music that  Ozzy was into, um, didn't understand and believed everything they read.  And, you know, it's like a Chinese whisper, you know, he bit the head off a bat.  No, actually, he ate a baby.  So, you know, it just, you know, snowballs.  And people now, you know, see Ozzy as, he's just a lovable guy. 
[02:10:00]  You know, he's, he's a great guy.  And so he sings about the darker side of life.  You know, you can't sing about, you know, happy, shiny people all day.  It's boring.  Yeah, bravo on that.  Did you want to just smack him in the head with that ATV, uh, accident?  I mean, like, what are you doing?  Do you, do you, uh, do you, are you a little more protective of him now?  And, and he comes up with some harebrained idea that he wants to do and you just go, look,  look, what are you doing?  No, it, all of that, the bikes, cause he had a whole collection of dirt bikes and all 
[02:10:30]  these different things and the guns and the, that I'm like, no, no more.  Oh, sorry, you're done.  God, I can't take it anymore.  No, over.  Yeah, done.  I want you to buy him done.  Here's what I want you to put him in.  So all is well.  I want you to just like one of those big things, like with rubber balls that kids bounce in.  Yeah, exactly.  Nothing that can even fall off of.  Nothing that will get gigs canceled.  I need to see Sabbath again.  But you know, he's always been accident prone.  If there's something that's going to happen, it will happen to Ozzy. 
[02:11:00]  You know, he goes in a shower, slips, down, broke, breaks a leg.  Every time.  He's so accident prone.  Wait, are they cutting us off?  Yeah, we got to get out of here.  We are on a timed thing because there's another show that comes in after us.  How dare they?  I don't like it.  Tell them to go away.  Wait, we got to plug Sharon's book, which is excellent.  Sharon Osbourne, Extreme, My Autobiography.  It's in stores now.  And I mean, I'm being really honest.  It's fantastic and it's honest and there's a lot of pictures in it. 
[02:11:30]  For those of you like me that just want to see photos, it's a great book.  And you look beautiful.  Absolutely beautiful.  Stunning.  Thank you, Sharon.  We're really happy you came in.  Wish you had more time with us.  I'll come back.  She'll come back.  Sharon Osbourne, everyone.  Thank you, Sharon.  Thank you.  Really fast.  The Opie and Anthony Halloween show is brought to you by Saw 3.  If it's Halloween, it must be Saw in theaters everywhere tomorrow.  Speaking of the Halloween tickets, my brother here, Brother Elmo, will be at FH Riley's 400 New York Avenue in Huntington,  my brother's restaurant, with a lot of Halloween tickets in his back pocket Friday and Saturday night. 
[02:12:00]  Just make sure you say Paul R. Nelson to me.  All right.  And also, today's football picks, sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  Thank you.  Hey, what's up?  It's Louis Twitchell's Santani.  Shut up!  Tourette's Day is coming to the Opie and Anthony show, 
[02:12:30]  which is to say that we've discovered a new excuse to point and laugh at people who are different.  To help us understand a little bit more about Tourette's,  we've enlisted the help of hearing-impaired Chicago reporter Karen Meyer.  Tourette's is walking through a neurological disorder.  That's cute to our spine involuntarily sticks in repeated vocalizations.  Exactly.  So if you have Tourette's or if you know somebody with Tourette's,  muster up some courage in an ounce of self-control and get in touch with the Opie and Anthony show.  Contact Steve at foundrymusic.com. 
[02:13:00]  That's Steve at foundrymusic.com.  And remember, be yourself, one ticket at a time.  Tourette's Day.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Does it really?  It's not that cold, Anthony.  Come on!  No, it's time for my Eskimo jacket.  I have my big, heavy jacket on with my hood.  My homeless jacket, I call it. 
[02:13:30]  It's a Timberland.  It's very warm.  It's made for, like, sub-zero temperature.  The music's so loud, I'm distracted.  To turn down the music a little bit every day, we have to ask them to turn down the music a little bit.  Thank you.  We're outside Free FM.  We've got a lot of people out here because they're all expecting Halloween tickets.  Oh, is that it?  I think we kind of said we'd have tickets today, right?  And what happened?  I don't know what happened.  Oh, there goes Sharon.  Bye, Sharon.  Sharon Osbourne, everyone.  Bye, Sharon.  She was great for the show today.  And I've got to tell you something. 
[02:14:00]  Jimmy, you sounded worse than I did with Shawnee.  You were in love.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, man.  Sharon is really sexy, man.  She gives you a hug when you get a picture.  Yeah.  Nice.  A little hug.  Yeah.  She smelled nice.  And the perfect amount of plastic surgery, by the way.  Yes.  Oh.  I mean that in a nice way.  She takes care of it where she keeps her looking young.  But one or two more operations.  She doesn't have any bizarre thing going on.  She's going to start leaning toward it.  No.  You can't tell she had plastic surgery.  She should stop right there. 
[02:14:30]  She looks good.  She looks great.  What's up, Kenny?  She'll turn into Joan Rivers.  Yeah.  We kind of said that.  Yeah.  So, thanks.  Thanks for adding to something we kind of said.  You've got it, G.H.  How funny was it this morning, Anthony?  Time to cut the strawberries.  Time to cut the strawberries.  Where the hell did her car go?  Oh, she's in a truck or whatever?  Yeah.  They're gone.  They're gone.  So, what are we going to do about the Halloween tickets?  A lot of people showed up for the tickets today.  Yeah.  Do we have something?  Why the fuck don't we have tickets? 
[02:15:00]  We were trying to get the hard tickets printed up before today's walk, but it didn't happen.  I think we're going to give away the Halloween tickets on Monday and Tuesday, because a lot  of people will come in for the day Tuesday before the party.  Doesn't do much for the people that are here today, does it?  Yeah, I understand.  Monday and Tuesday, though, during the walkover, we'll definitely have hard tickets for the  Halloween party.  So, keep that in mind.  How do you feel walking past the scene of the crime, Ope?  I feel pretty good, Ann.  I feel pretty good.  Poor Andrew probably had to eat cat shit out of that little tin box.  Where's my, uh, a treat for you? 
[02:15:30]  Where is he?  He's not here.  I think he's had it with us.  Yeah, you think he's moved on?  How could he not?  Greener pastures.  No one, go to a place where no one stomps on his cake.  Right, Ann.  I still got to sleep at night, man.  I am not scared.  It's getting cold fast, man.  Yeah, fuck this noise.  Oh, but we're going right to Denver.  Hold on, hold on.  I got an update on the Halloween tickets. 
[02:16:00]  What, Danny?  Follow me.  We can take some names for Halloween tickets.  Oh, we can?  Yeah.  All right, we'll do that, Dan, because these guys showed up, and it's pretty cold here in  New York today.  Pretty chilly.  Hence the quick walk.  Yeah, this is going to be a quick one.  You don't care.  Look, we're crossing against lights.  I'm marching.  We're just crossing against lights.  Look, Ron, Ron, you're not going to make it.  We're okay.  Screw that.  Look at all the people behind us that are in the middle of traffic.  In the middle of traffic.  That's okay.  Cabs know to not run over people. 
[02:16:30]  All right.  Fucking savages.  Yesterday, and here's another thing that cabs are starting to do now, this entitlement  that cabbies have.  I needed a lift yesterday, and I needed to get to 49th and Madison.  And the guy tells me, he goes, oh, you can't, we can't go there because after I drop you  off, I can't turn off that street.  Like, I don't give a fuck what you got to do after you drop me off.  That's where I want to go.  Your job is a cab driver.  Right.  You take me from where we are to where I want to go. 
[02:17:00]  And this fucking savage is arguing with me about what he would have to do after he drops  me off to get back around because there's a no turn off a certain street area over there.  I could give a fuck.  That's what you're getting paid for.  They're getting uppity.  I had a problem with a cabbie when I left here.  It wouldn't take me the route that I wanted to go on.  Do you believe these folks?  Oh, no.  It's more traffic.  I'm like, no, it's not.  I go there every day.  So I took his number and his name and I fucking called 3-1-1 and filed an official complaint. 
[02:17:30]  Good for you.  Good for you, Jimmy.  And you know what?  I'll never show up for the hearing.  I call another number.  Another number on my cell phone.  Hi, guys.  And really get him in trouble.  More people outside XM looking for the Halloween tickets.  Hey, Anthony, tell the...  Friends, you know.  Tell the sinkhole story.  Oh, yeah, this is a nice meetup.  I had a meeting yesterday.  Very nice meeting.  With Chicago.  Over there with Chicago.  And, yeah, as I leave, I'm going back to my hotel and I notice a commotion. 
[02:18:00]  A little fire truck action.  They close down one of the streets and I walk down there to see what happens.  And there's a woman laying in the street.  Some think she's a dolt that ran out between two parked cars like they always do and got slammed by something.  But as I get closer, I see a fireman is holding up her leg and there's a sinkhole next to her.  That is the size of...  Perfect size for a foot and a calf to fit in. 
[02:18:30]  And I had almost fallen in this about three weeks ago.  We're crossing the street.  My girlfriend kind of went, hey, look out.  And I didn't fall in it.  But apparently this woman put her foot in it.  And the fireman's holding her leg up.  And she has a thysman leg.  Dude, fucking thysman leg.  It's hanging, but completely hanging in the middle of her shin.  So she's walking and she stepped in and probably fell forward?  She stepped in, fell forward, and it just snapped her leg.  So the thing about New Yorkers is we don't give a shit. 
[02:19:00]  It's just an opportunity to stare and make jokes.  Because instantly, instead of, wow, how did that happen, that poor woman?  It's like somebody actually said loud enough for her to hear, hey, congratulations, you  just won the New York State lotto.  Yeah.  Yeah, they know.  Because, yeah, she's going to get a ton of money for that.  A boatload.  Yeah, a boatload of money for that.  A boatload of money for that.  And there's a fan.  There's another one.  Yeah, we got a double.  Hi, sir.  Very cool. 
[02:19:30]  What I liked the most, though, was a fireman asked her if she could feel her toes.  So he kind of squeezed her toe.  And she lifted her head.  And I guess it was her first glimpse she got of her leg hanging like that.  Because she didn't know.  And everyone started chuckling as she's screaming her head off.  No!  No!  Because she saw her leg dangling.  And just New Yorkers looking at each other with little smiles like, look at it.  She's hurting.  We are just a bunch of pricks. 
[02:20:00]  Hey, Miss, you want to win some money?  Miss?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Are you having a little contest?  We have a little contest, ma'am.  Are you having a little contest?  Wowee.  You'll love it.  All right.  Hey, um.  Want to go upstairs?  Jesus, what a horrid ass.  Do you still have your horrid ass photo collection?  Yes, I do.  She would have been perfect.  Look at her ass.  You know what's ironic?  That someone with a stink hole fell in a sinkhole.  Kenny has to say something. 
[02:20:30]  Hey, listen up, folks.  Whoever wants Halloween tickets, line up over here.  We're going to take your names and give you Halloween tickets.  Aw!  Aw!  What's nice of you, Kenny?  Why are you being so nice today, Kenny?  You're organized and sweet.  We love the fans.  No, we don't.  And we're glad that you shaved that almost mustache.  Yeah.  Yeah, I shaved it for you.  Throw it back.  Be that cop that you were.  Once again, we were discussing your mustache yesterday.  You've got to either grow it all the way in or don't bother.  The in-between thing is creeping us all out. 
[02:21:00]  I'm emasculated.  You don't even have to shave.  Ed Hughes put me in my place.  Just stand in front of the fan and it will blow that little wispy shit off.  Creeps me out.  All right.  I'll try to have better hygiene.  Done it.  Any comments about my dry hair?  No.  I think...  I think...  Oh, you got us.  Run away, faggot.  Run away.  Oh, boy.  Come on, Powie.  Hey, where are you going?  Why don't you say it on mic?  Come on.  You got a mic? 
[02:21:30]  Faggot!  There you go, you fucking pussy.  He's a pussy.  Go ahead.  You and your boyfriend.  Who sucks who?  Who's the power bottom?  I prefer to...  Oh.  He doesn't have anything.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll have Fan squirt something on his neck.  That's right.  All right.  Shut up.  Stay on the neck.  Wow.  Look at this shit taking pictures.  Are you insane?  Did you get any good shots, Miz?  No.  No?  No.  That's big A, of course. 
[02:22:00]  Let's take a picture.  Come on.  Have your fella take a picture of us.  Oh.  Good fella.  Come on.  Okay.  Okay.  You're welcome.  All right.  Let's go upstairs.  That's an interesting device.  If you want Halloween tickets, stay out here, and then we'll get some people upstairs  and check out the show.  Did you see big A?  Yeah.  He's got an interesting device in his ear.  On him, it's called a brown tooth.  Thanks, guys.  We'll see.  A blue tooth on a blue whale. 
[02:22:30]  We'll get some of you guys upstairs, all right?  Open the door.  It's cold.  O.B.  Anthony.  XM 202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Angle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go. 
[02:23:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, cornwalls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt. 
[02:23:30]  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.

[02:25:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:25:30]  So obviously a big log is coming out of Opie right now.  Big Kev getting my Peter Criss picture signed today.  Big Kev is a good boy.  Big Kev got a plug.  What's going on?  I'll be at Chiller Theater this weekend.  Chiller Theater, one of the cons.  Yes, you can go to chillertheater.com for more info.  What are some of the big stars that are going to be down there?  Because I know every year that just the celebrities that come out for this thing. 
[02:26:00]  Like Jimmy said, Peter Criss, but Peter Criss.  And I'm very excited about that.  But Paul Rubin's Pee Wee Herman.  Pee Wee Herman.  Wow.  One of his first appearances at one of these shindigs.  As far as I've ever seen.  Yeah, that's a pretty big celebrity.  Right.  Who are some of the peripheral people?  Some of the people, I don't know.  You might know them, but not big names.  Well, I don't know what anyone.  I mean, to everybody, Anthony, to me, everybody, a big name.  Because I like the ones that their biggest credit is one episode of The Twilight Zone. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, I'm sure there's going to be a handful of people like that.  Just sitting lonely at a table.  Anthony Michael Hall will be there.  Oh.  Tell him I said hello.  Look, we had a weird misunderstanding.  Not we.  We?  Not me.  Oh.  It was a weird thing.  You guys thought that he.  No.  He was scheduled to come in, and people thought that he kind of blew the show off the last day.  But I told you, I hung with him in A.C. before that. 
[02:27:00]  You hung.  Wait, wait.  Just the word hung and then A.C.?  You're right.  I'm a douche.  But you don't know.  We're the same manager.  So he came to Atlantic City, and he wanted to write something for me.  He likes my stuff and whatever.  He saw the HBO special.  And I talked to him.  You know, O.P. and Anthony, the last day we were on.  He goes, I don't even know that.  Some publicist probably yanked him on that last day.  I would think that probably happened.  We shouldn't hold that against him, because I think that he's actually.  His show's really good, too.  He's a very cool dude, too.  And also.  Anthony McConnor.  I like the dead zone on TV. 
[02:27:30]  It's pretty good.  Peripheral people.  Anthony, Sam was kind enough to remind me that troubled former child star Todd Bridges.  Well, Todd Bridges.  Of course, Todd Bridges will be there.  He'll be there also.  I like the other thing.  I ran down the list one year.  You sent me a link to the list of all the people.  And it's like some of these people that were on Star Trek episodes.  Some of those will be in attendance.  Like one episode.  Yeah.  And they weren't even a main character in that episode.  Right.  And they've kind of made a career out of that, sitting at a table. 
[02:28:00]  I love those guys.  Yeah, you do.  I love those guys.  Congratulations.  Well, have fun there.  Almost the entire cast of the Warriors.  Now, that would be fucking nice.  Almost the entire cast.  Now, see, that's something cool, because then you can go there.  Maybe we go to the video game, get it signed.  Right.  Something like that.  Who's not going to be there, though?  Who is Cyrus dead?  No, Cyrus is going to be there.  Is he?  Yeah.  Swear to God.  Swear to God he's going to be there.  How great would it be to get those guys in the studio? 
[02:28:30]  What about the other guy?  Warriors.  I'll work on it.  Is he going to be there?  I think he is going to be there.  Come out and play.  I think he's going to be there.  To promote their fucking thing.  That would have been fun to have those guys in there.  Gans from 48 Hours.  Ajax.  I bet he's not there.  I think he's not going to be there.  I bet he's not.  He's got a career.  He's still...  Cyrus doesn't really do much.  No.  But he's going to be there.  He's in that show, Dexter.  Oh.  The one that's on Showtime now.  He plays Dexter's father when they do the flashback scenes.  Yeah.  You're going to humiliate me.  That's a great show.  Oh, sorry, Jimmy.  No, no, no.  That's not spit out lettuce. 
[02:29:00]  That's not Cyrus.  That's Ajax.  Ajax, yeah.  I'm not Cyrus.  Cyrus not doing anything.  That I know of.  Gans, though, from 48 Hours, I think is more of a...  I like them better as Gans.  Nice gun.  Wow.  We've got two dumps that we've got to discuss today.  What happened?  Where's the...  Where, why?  All I say is where, why?  That's right.  And we know what you mean.  The where is out there now.  The why, why isn't it in front of me?  Well, let's play the music.  I can read them, and then you can comment, okay?  Give me the dump music, please.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report. 
[02:29:30]  7.28 a.m.  Norton's description of what the aborted fetus looked like after it was yanked out in two pieces.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Why was that, uh...  I don't know.  I think there's been some meetings going on, because the next one is really why.  All right.  7.32 a.m.  Paul R. Nelson is not a fan of the faggot. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  You can't use faggot.  You're a faggot in a way of gay people.  Why?  I could call you a faggot, but you can't say, um, those people in San Francisco are faggots.  Yeah, you can.  As long as you don't establish that you're talking about homosexuals, I'm so sorry.  I know I'm going to get killed for this.  I'm talking my mouth full.  That's okay.  But it's cock.  Full of...  Thank you.  I was just going to say that, but...  You think I didn't see you hearing up?  No.  Zipping down. 
[02:30:30]  Faggot is clearly being used as a derogatory term for homosexuals.  That's a CBS decision.  Tom says that's just a corporate decision.  Corporate.  It has nothing to do with the FCC.  It's all about, um...  It was said in humor.  Yeah.  And even the faggot enjoyed that.  They don't like that.  When you said it, I knew it was going to be dumped.  You did?  I'll give you a little hint.  I'll give you a little clue.  Right when it came out of your mouth, I knew it was going to be dumped.  I got to study a little hard.  How about this?  Instead of faggots, we'll say dirty homos from now on.  Queer motherfucker.  No, you can't say no one.  How about queer father effort? 
[02:31:00]  Oh, yeah.  That would be more appropriate, more accurate.  Yeah.  They have a problem.  I don't like the fact they dumped out of an abortion description.  Yeah.  Why was that?  Was that too graphic?  Did I say yanked out of, maybe?  What was...  Maybe what was said before that might have set something up, too.  They dumped yanked out in two pieces.  In two pieces.  All right.  Get some more info on that from the great Mr. Dukes on why that was dumped.  Is it because of sexual content or political? 
[02:31:30]  Blizzard warning for where?  Oh, no.  Jeremy and Aspen, what's up?  West Palm.  CNN just had a blizzard warning, but I don't know for what city.  Hey.  Jeremy.  This is actually for Jimmy's show in Denver.  You're more likely to get raped by a deer than this blizzard doing anything in Denver.  It won't bother us?  They don't do shit, man.  Yeah, I heard, like, they had some kind of warning up until noon today.  Well, the thing is, is that Denver's full of a lot of pussies. 
[02:32:00]  And the way it goes is, if they get a dusting, they're going to lie and complain, it's a blizzard of 2006.  I live up here in the mountains.  I've got two feet of snow underneath me right now.  Could you take this guy's call, Opie?  What happened?  I've got to get some soup.  Oh.  Yeah.  Just, yeah.  All right.  I'll use Jimmy's mic.  All right.  What soup are you going for today?  The soup man.  Barley.  Jambalaya. 
[02:32:30]  I want a split pea.  What is this?  Beet barley.  No, no.  All right.  I won't be having any soup today.  Why?  Sit back down.  Stop tripping.  What are you doing?  Will you sit down?  Why don't you have any soup?  I'll move.  We're not used to you moving around so much.  What's going on with you?  Oh, I know it's because I was behind you.  Turkey chili.  I've never seen you move before.  That was very interesting.  I know.  Chili.  And it's on mic, and then I turn around, and he's on mic here.  I never see him move.  I don't want a sandwich.  It's very strange when you move like that.  I want a turkey chili. 
[02:33:00]  Maybe.  I've demanded it.  Enough about the soup.  Every fucking day with a goddamn soup, no one gives a shit.  You want me to take a nice liquidy dump?  That looks like turkey chili.  Who is the douche that has to dump the soup in studio so we're distracted every day for  15 to 20 minutes?  But it's delicious.  It really is lovely.  I'm not having any.  It's distracting as hell, man.  Language, please.  Have it set up nice outside the studio.  People can pick their soup real fast and come on in here.  All right.  I'm sorry not everybody can get this distracting service that you're getting right now. 
[02:33:30]  What?  Fucking Kenny coming in with your shit.  Here's your banana.  There it is.  And your fresh fruit.  You have the worst timing, Kenny.  I finally had these guys right where I wanted them.  Jesus H. Christ.  Right where I wanted them.  Yeah?  What do you think about this banana?  Oh, God damn it.  There's a banana off Jimmy's ass.  Damn it.  Hey, I had them, Kenny.  I had them.  We're getting settled in here. 
[02:34:00]  Someone get me a Diet Coke and I'm going to have them wear the sandwich.  Thank you to the guys who brought the sandwiches.  They're very nice.  All right.  Smoothie.  Whoa.  Don't yell at everyone.  All right.  And make sure they put more goddamn banana in it than strawberry.  You know what happened?  The owner came and cock blocked the smoothie maker and said, just half a banana.  He really fucked up yesterday.  I left half a smoothie there because it sucked ass.  And if I don't get banana, then he's never getting my service again.  How cheap is this guy?  That's real cheap.  That's the owner.  You know what, banana costs, what, five cents?  Tell the owner to go, fuck off. 
[02:34:30]  There's a new boatload of savages down there, so.  You've got to be retrained?  Yeah, well.  If that smoothie comes back too pink, Anthony's going to lose it.  I really will not.  We will just, I'll stop having smoothies.  And you watch.  That girl's here for the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest?  Oh, no.  If she's not.  Well, I'm just assuming.  Stupid me.  She here for the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest?  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:35:00]  Our current leader is Honey from Binghamton.  She's 505 pounds.  This broad doesn't stand a chance.  We're paying $10 a pound.  Plus, we're giving someone $1,000 as a finder's fee for bringing in the winner of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  I'm big, you're small.  Scout.  Look at the camel toe.  Can you stand up?  I want to.  I can't see from that.  Here, come by the window.  Oh, boy.  Come by the window.  She's like bottom heavy.  Wow, let me see.  She's a big girl.  No, nowhere near Honey. 
[02:35:30]  What, about four?  She doesn't know?  She doesn't know.  Would you avoid heels?  I'm going to say she's 350.  Yeah, maybe.  She's not close.  350.  All right, sit down.  We'll get to you in a second.  We've got to say hi to Jerry Springer.  Oh.  Oh.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  They released me.  Yeah, we saw.  They let you go?  Yeah, Jerry got voted off last night.  He got the vote.  It's over, Johnny.  The ONA pest did a great job, but it's over. 
[02:36:00]  They cheated, Jerry, because I guarantee you we got you enough votes.  They just cheated.  No, it was time for me to go.  They overcame your efforts.  They did not like to bask in the shadow of your greatness.  Oh, yeah.  No, it's great.  Now it's down to being a dancing show again, which is what it should have been, but I had  a great time, and you guys, honestly, if I ever run for anything, you're the organization.  Yeah, of course we are.  Jerry, did we see a tear on TV last night?  Aw.  It was the onions.  Did we see a Jerry Springer tear last night? 
[02:36:30]  Getting a little emotional?  You're making me go soft now.  No, don't do that.  When you get done on that crazy TV show of yours, and there you are crying on national  TV last night.  A little tear from, uh, Jerry was crying.  A little tear from Jerry.  You got a little emotional up there when you had to say goodbye to everybody.  Well, it wasn't, it was like everyone was so incredibly nice, and it just dawned on me  how many people go through life where, you know, everyone just says, you know, gee, you're  one of, we like you, or whatever.  It was just, yeah. 
[02:37:00]  A little overwhelming?  Yeah, it was, just for a second.  Just for a second.  But then I regained my manhood.  Good thing, because you give those goddamn final thoughts with the driest eyes ever.  Yeah.  Talking about horrific things.  And then a little dance show gets you a little choked up.  Yeah.  That's all right.  Yeah.  Yeah, the girl, uh, you know, coming out on her palms, because she has no lower half  of her body, that doesn't bother you.  That doesn't bring a tear.  No, that doesn't bring a tear.  But a silly little dance show gets you bawling.  What else gets you there, Jerry? 
[02:37:30]  Ghost?  Did you cry at Ghost?  I got a little choked up.  Yankee's losing.  Hey, Jerry, I finally, I finally checked out the show last night.  Uh, that, that, that piece of ass you're dancing with.  Oh, my God.  Very attractive girl.  Where's she from?  And, and, and, and now you asked why I was crying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  Where's she from?  Australia?  Uh, yeah.  Australia.  It was really cute when you told her that you would, uh, be more than willing to adopt  her so you'd have another daughter.  She's a great kid.  Yeah, she really is. 
[02:38:00]  You really want her as another wife, don't you, Jerry?  No.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Someone, Jerry, someone told me, like, one of the producers or something said that you'll  be talking about the Opie and Anthony show on your show.  What was that, what was that about?  If, if he won.  Oh, thank you.  I'll depend on Jerry.  He said if he won the whole thing, he would acknowledge us.  I actually just made that up completely.  Oh, did you?  Yeah, well, it was good.  It was good.  It was a good show.  I was hoping Jerry would go, yeah, no, I'm going to mention it.  Complete fabrication.  Well, at this point, there's no reason for anyone to, to watch the show, so.  So, Jerry's off. 
[02:38:30]  Our fans could go back to their normal lives.  Watch other things.  They got other projects.  That's right.  Well, the O&A pass, they got other projects to get into now, so they're done with that  dumb show.  We were watching for you, Jerry.  When are you going to be in New York?  Actually, I'm, I think I may be there Monday.  I think they have me on the Good Morning America and then doing Letterman or something  like that.  They're going to work it out and tell me today.  Can you stop by?  We'd love to.  If I'm in New York, sure I will.  Yeah.  Okay.  We want to talk about, you know, your TV show now. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Hey, I was watching on YouTube.  I'm obsessed with YouTube.  And I started with Opie and Anthony videos.  Next thing I know, I'm watching Jerry Springer, spring break, 19, I don't know, late 80s,  I think.  And you did a show in front of everyone with women with enormous boobs.  Gosh, that sounds so unlike me.  That's the beauty of YouTube.  You start, you know, at one place and all of a sudden you're like, how did I get here?  I'm watching Jerry Springer at spring break. 
[02:39:30]  And it was a panel of girls with massive, massive, like ridiculous over-the-top boobs and how awful  their lives are because their breasts are so big.  Oh, that was the show we did on the impact of inflation on the world bond market.  I remember that.  I guess you did it for MTV or something.  Yeah.  Actually, that's right.  Those were the years I was doing the spring break MTV, right?  Yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  Thanks for reminding me.  I forget these things.  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  All right, Jerry.  Hey, thanks.  You guys have been great.  Thanks.  And, you know, I'm starting a chain of dance studios now around the country.  Good luck with that.  You're going to be there.  Yeah.  Jerry, you made that show fun.  So congratulations on that.  Okay.  Continued success.  You go get them.  Okay.  Thanks.  Hopefully we'll see you Monday.  Thanks, Jerry.  Bye, mister.  Jerry Springer, everyone, saying thanks for what we did today.  Fun farewell to Jerry and the dancing show.  By the way, speaking of Monday, can we have Paul Stanley coming and doing the walkover?  What a gift I got. 
[02:40:30]  What a gift.  Oh, you scared me.  Here's a little note.  Can I see your gift?  Yes, you actually can.  It's called...  Why the look after you said that?  I would love you to see it, actually.  I'm going to hand it right over.  Believe me, you're more than welcome to this gift.  I don't want to be predictable.  I hate being predictable.  Jimmy, the mad Mexican oneness in a claw machine for you this week.  He thought you'd like to have it to add to your kiss collection.  It's a... 
[02:41:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, God damn it.  It's a cloth Paul Stanley doll.  And...  It's a...  It's a...  Let me see the little tag.  It's called...  It's a toy, and Paul's head is huge. 
[02:41:30]  Looks like Soonyi Previn.  And he's got, like, little wispy, awful hairs.  No, I'll give you a great example of what that is.  You ever been to a really cheesy, cheap fair?  Yes.  And the booths that are set up where you win things, that is what you win if you do  the least thing possible to win something prize. 
[02:42:00]  Right.  You know those stuffed animals that aren't even animals?  Like, it's shaped like just an oval with a print of, like, a penguin on the front?  It's like, here's a stuffed penguin.  No, it's like an egg-shaped thing with a penguin stamped on the front of it.  That is the cheapest piece of shit.  It's a cloth thing, and the feet are really big.  It looks like it's fucking Dudley Moore.  Fucking Paul Stanley with two club feet.  And the hands are like big, puffy puppet hands.  Yeah.  And they're around this fucking thin... 
[02:42:30]  The guitar feels almost like...  What kind of material is this?  Spongebob.  Like a felt.  It's a felt...  Thick felt.  Thin, thick piece of felt.  Felt.  It's like the collar on a felt jacket, one of the dinner variety.  And, uh, it's a fucking piece of shit.  And there's drawn-on black chest hairs.  And there's black thing around the neck in case Paul wants to die of auto-asphyxiation.  This fucking gift stinks.  That is a bad one.  The mad Mexican sent me a hunk of shit. 
[02:43:00]  But, Kev, I want some, uh, split pea soup.  I want to try the...  All right.  The soup from, uh, the soup.  That's an interesting choice.  I don't remember who I've heard of.  Look, Paul likes to grab a little song.  I was made for loving you, baby.  Yes, I was.  Can I hear that again?  I was made for loving you, baby.  Yes, I was.  As Kevin hands me my split pea soup.  Have some split pea soup.  Split pea soup.  I love split pea soup.  Oh, this fucking doll is awful. 
[02:43:30]  Crank the top open.  Where'd the mad Mexican win this?  Was there a claw toy dipping into his asshole and it pulled this out?  Jimmy, can I see your doll?  It's a lot of obesity, I think.  You have to be nice to it, because I want to have Paul sign it.  I'll show Paul.  The mad Mexican was right.  Maybe I could show Paul.  Paul, look what I have!  Can I see it, Jimmy?  Sure, Ope.  Here you are.  Did the note actually say to show Paul that?  No, but why else would it be?  Oh, yeah.  Look, it's really nice. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, that's a big head of hair on it.  Do we have a picture?  Let Hawk take a picture, Ope.  I like the hair.  Look at that.  Yeah.  It's like rock and roll.  Die!  Oh, jeez.  Oh, my God.  Paul is drowning.  Oh, wow.  Oh, look, his head's heavy now.  You've got water head.  Die!  Oh, he looks like somebody puked on his head. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, I'm not feeling too.  Oh, God.  Oh, I don't know.  Wow, that is really...  Ugh.  Oh, look.  Oh, yeah.  That's what he looks like after a night.  After a kiss show.  That's a kiss.  There's your hero, Jimmy!  But I want to know, why is he lying in vomit still holding his guitar?  Why won't he put the guitar down?  God damn. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, there's your hero.  Face down in vomit.  Why is he holding the guitar?  Yeah, there are people commenting.  I saw that same picture in 1977.  Backstage at the garden.  I love split pee.  Where the Mad Mexican sends fucking abominable gifts.  Has the Mad Mexican ever sent a gift that anyone wanted?  No, unless it was his own head in a box.  Or his severed dog paws.  Just horrid.  Chicago's paws in a box. 
[02:45:30]  There's this picture of him and his dog, Chicago.  No.  And, of course, that's ripped up.  Because it's another awful gift.  Thank you, Mad Mexican.  It obviously is the thought that counts.  Because it's certainly not the price.  I'm trying to break the camera.  No, I'm not breaking cameras today.  There it is.  Okay, perfect shot.  Just setting up a shot for the...  Yeah, set it up.  Just leave it there.  Yeah, we can leave it there for a while.  I won't take it.  That really does just stink. 
[02:46:00]  That fucking...  It's very rare a gift will make me angry.  But that gift made me angry.  And it should, because it sucked.  What is that now?  Food.  I have food.  Hawk brought me a sandwich, which I want.  Thank you, baby.  All right, listen.  We're going to regroup here.  We're going to do...  Hmm.  Oh, I don't know.  What do you think, Jimmy?  Well, what I want to do, first and foremost, is I'd like to look at my Sharon Osbourne shirt.  All right. 
[02:46:30]  And...  Stop with the dramatization.  A lot of drama with Jimmy.  A lot of drama.  Enough of the dramatization.  I think young Eric got one of my Sharon shirt signed, didn't he?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Let me see that, Jimmy.  What?  Let me see that.  He better have.  No.  Let me see that.  Oh, no.  There it is.  I don't think that's a good idea.  To Jimmy, best wishes, love, pea soup. 
[02:47:00]  No, she didn't sign my book.  I got her to sign my picture.  All right.  The fatty's coming in next.  Oh.  What?  What did I say?  Is she here for the contest?  You're here for the contest, right?  What?  What happened?  She's cool.  You all right with that?  What?  Sort of?  I don't feel too good about myself now.  Are you all right?  How can you ever?  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Fuck everyone.  Fuck you.  Fuck you. 
[02:47:30]  Hey, I want to give a big fuck you to all you New Jersey fucking drivers who drive here  in Pennsylvania in the passing lane at 55 miles an hour and you don't even get over.  I want to give you a big fuck you to you guys.  I hate you.  Yeah, I just want to say fuck you to my fucking dispass for making me fucking work all fucking  day.  Thanks a lot, assholes.  Fucking cunt.  I'd like to send a big F you to the lady of the attitude.  She's standing there with your arms crossed glaring at me while I work and then you yell 
[02:48:00]  when I ask you not to.  Excuse me.  I own the building.  Fuck you and your building.  Yeah, this is to my schizophrenic wife, Dana.  Fuck you, you fucking cunt.  Yo.  I'm up with this growth card.  I didn't get no fucking pussy.  So I want to give a big fuck you to her.  And her friends.  All right?  Fuck this shit, dude.  What am I doing with my life?  I didn't get no fucking pussy.  Fuck all y'all.  Call the Opie and Anthony F you line at 866-FU-LINE1. 
[02:48:30]  That's 866-FU-LINE1.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, fuck him.  Jim Norton will be appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman Wednesday, November 1st.  Check local listings for showtimes.  All right.  Want to say hi to Jen?  Come on in, Jen. 
[02:49:00]  I just don't like the fact in that promo Steve said, Paul Stanley of the band Kiss.  Fucking over-explaining zilch.  Robert Plant of the band Led Zeppelin.  Yeah, exactly.  We'll be appearing on The Opie and Anthony Show.  Not a Kiss fan, huh, Steve?  Why don't you put that Robert Plant was the lead and only vocalist?  Hi, Jen.  How are you?  Okay.  Hi, guys.  You're from Rockaway?  Yeah.  Who's the other guy?  It's my husband.  Hello, mister.  Hello.  How long have you guys been married?  Four years.  Four years. 
[02:49:30]  Fans of the show?  Four years of wedded fucking bliss, huh?  Nice.  Jen came in for Fatty Pick Fatty, but she doesn't know how much...  You don't know how much you weigh?  No.  You're not even 350.  Yeah, we're experts.  I was 44 last time I was ever weighed, but that was a couple years ago.  And you lost some weight?  I don't know.  Do you think you did?  Hoping I didn't, but...  Turn sideways.  Wait, you don't want to lose weight?  Well, yeah, but not for the contest.  Yeah, could you lift the back of the jacket up?  I just got to see some real estate. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, you know, small ass for a bigger woman.  I'm feeling...  I'm feeling...  Want to make a bet?  I say...  338.  But I got the ass in the front.  Yeah, you got some ass.  Yeah, you do.  You got something going on.  You got something going on.  338.  I'm going to say...  I'm going to say 338.  Well, you said that.  I'm going to say 382.  That's just my thing.  379, I mean.  Yeah, the leader's 505.  You're not close.  You're not that tall.  No way.  She's not that tall.  How tall are you?  5'8 and a half.  Oh, 5'8 and a half. 
[02:50:30]  Kids?  What can I tell you?  You guys got kids?  Yeah, so...  Now, was she...  Were you a big girl when you got married?  Yeah.  How big?  Big all your life?  Yeah.  Teased all your life?  Yeah, but I can handle that.  That's good.  You like big girls, sir?  You always like big chicks?  Yeah, pretty much.  Yeah.  That's what they call them, you know.  Yeah.  That's what they call me.  And you guys love gum, I see.  Yeah.  I love chewing something.  Gotta be chewing something all the time. 
[02:51:00]  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, it's like...  That's cool.  That's all right.  Yeah.  What's your shirt say?  I'm big.  You're small.  Have a nice day.  Have a nice day.  I bet your husband bought that for you.  Yeah.  That's cool.  That's almost like,  fuck with me and I'm going to kick your ass kind of shirt.  Do you kick ass?  Yeah.  Sir?  Me?  Yeah.  Nah.  You do all right, though?  Yeah.  All right.  What are you, a Spanish lady?  No.  Heinz 57.  A little everything?  A little bit of everything? 
[02:51:30]  A little everything thrown in there.  Black, Jewish, three tribes, American Indian, Mongolian.  You name it.  Jesus.  Really?  Did you get that emerged?  Anybody who hasn't been conquered?  No.  Nothing on that one.  I like this.  I mean, you gotta realize, everybody's fucking...  That's accurate.  Not funny.  No, what is this?  I'm kidding, Jimmy.  No, you're actually right.  What is the position you have sexually the most?  I know this is a cheesedick question, but what is your favorite?  The position the most common for you guys?  And I'm asking, honestly, because you're a big girl, so I'm asking, like, do you like 
[02:52:00]  to be on top or do you like to be on the bottom?  Because some people, like, I like an ass in my face.  I like to be smothered with an ass.  There's something about fucking being, having it all around me.  And if you're into big women, you might like a girl to be on top of you and just be  fucking surrounded.  It's usually from behind.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Really?  Well, there you go.  Conquered again.  Still being conquered.  Yeah.  Ah.  See?  She's ready.  Do you like that?  Ready with that joke?  A little doggy style?  You prefer it?  Well, we have different positions that we do.  Totally?  Yeah.  Who's more dominant? 
[02:52:30]  She is.  Are you?  Yeah, it's obvious.  You're really the dominant one?  I suppose so.  Do you spank him?  No, no spanking.  Do you make him kiss your feet?  No.  What's the craziest thing you guys do in bed?  Yeah.  You can say it.  Maybe one drunk night.  I don't know.  I don't think we get that crazy.  No?  No.  One little lick it up night.  You decide to do something a little wacky.  A little crazy.  Something you feel silly.  In the room next door, you gotta kind of.  Clean it up after. 
[02:53:00]  I'm calm.  How do you talk when you're having sex?  Are you like, yeah, I'm, are you talking dirty or are you doing like really nasty or are  you very loving when you're having sex?  Yeah, I'm the dirty talker.  You are.  He just gets it done.  Really?  What do you like to say?  Oh, I'll have a veal parmesan hero.  It's a big man.  Quarter pound of wood cheese.  No.  No, she probably talks.  She probably talks dirty, but occasionally slips up like, yeah, fuck me.  Fuck me.  Come on my face. 
[02:53:30]  All right, please drive around.  So you're more comfortable being vocal than he is.  He's a more quiet guy.  Yeah.  Okay.  What kind of stuff are you talking about in bed?  I'm actually filling up.  I like, I like the dirty talk.  Are you filling up?  What did you say?  Just fuck me?  Or do you say other things?  Do you get into scenarios and stuff like that?  No, we don't do scenarios.  It's just, yeah, that's it.  There we go.  You know, normal stuff.  All right.  Getting all Mongolian on him and shit.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:54:00]  More fried rice.  Mongolian.  Yeah, he's giving it to her.  He's like, fuck you.  You're four tribes Americans.  Yeah.  Well, we should.  They turn the camera off.  They don't even have any confidence that she's going to win.  Pop her up on the scale.  Make her feel comfortable at least.  Jesus.  If you're even.  I said 379.  That's probably way too high.  I'm saying 338.  You know what?  I'm going to change to 339.  You son of a bitch.  Son of a gun.  That bottom area, that's some heavy weight. 
[02:54:30]  I saw that on Jen in Cleveland.  You're going to be surprised.  This girl is going to come in at 400.  I said 379.  And 45 pounds.  How much?  45 pounds.  No way.  What?  3 what?  No way.  379.  445.  445.  I remember seeing that on Jen in Cleveland, and that gave her a lot of weight.  379.  The bunts area.  Listen, it's made of iron.  It's a heavy area, man.  That's all like water and fluids. 
[02:55:00]  Do you ever want to lose it?  Do you want to get surgery?  Yeah, I'm going to have gastric bypass surgery.  Are you really?  Okay.  You'll have to come see us with the new bod.  Yeah.  I told them once they can learn how to put boobs back where they're supposed to be, we're  all on.  Oh, really?  You can always get that fixed.  They can do that.  Yeah.  You got the sag a lot?  Oh.  Sir, do you want her to get the gastric?  She said she wants to get gastric.  It's up to her.  If she's comfortable with it, then yeah.  Yeah, right.  Good for you.  You're going to get a pussy whipped bypass surgery?  Yeah.  Whatever you say, honey. 
[02:55:30]  Okey-doke.  Whatever she wants.  Whatever she says.  That's good blanche to her.  All right.  Ah, he's a good man.  I'll keep my laws off her body.  That's good.  Okay, are we ready?  Yes.  All right, we're stepping on the scale.  This is the fact.  You love her regardless.  Yes.  There's no way she's even close.  And the family is...  No, I say 369.  I was off by 10.  Oh, it's 369?  Wow, I'm way off.  Damn.  You let me down.  I almost said 37.  I'm sorry.  I lost.  I took eight guesses, then I almost said I lied. 
[02:56:00]  I thought she was shorter than she is.  What did you say, Dan?  I said 338.  338.  I saw like E-Rock standing next to her.  I don't know, and I thought she was shorter.  E-Rock's no indicator, though.  His hair is deceptive.  Yeah, is that it?  And then like Steve.  Fuck.  All right.  Well, guys, thanks for coming by.  Thank you.  369.  Grab some food on your way out.  Yeah.  A lot of food around the joint today.  When are you going to get the surgery?  Um, probably next... 
[02:56:30]  I mean, February.  February, huh?  All right.  All right, cool.  Big Kev hat.  It's good for you.  All right.  Sam, turn off the camera.  Eight years to your life.  Save the film.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Take it easy.  You guys can sit out there and watch the rest of the show, though.  You can hang out.  It'll be great.  All right.  Talk dirty to each other.  We'd like to get it on tape.  I want to hear some good dirty talk.  Jimmy, a friend of yours is on the phone.  Dob.  Oh, shit.  Hello?  Hey, guys.  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up? 
[02:57:00]  I didn't catch much of that.  Who was that big woman?  Well, we're doing a Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Jim Norton came up with the name, which is absolutely brilliant.  We're looking for the heaviest girl to come through, and they're going to win $10 a pound.  The current leader is Honey from Binghamton.  She weighed 505 pounds.  There's also a $1,000 finer speed for the guy that eventually brings in the winner of the  Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Right.  Right.  Yes.  Tremendous.  So the guy that brought in Honey, you could consider either Charles Grodin or Jack Black, 
[02:57:30]  you know, whichever, whether you want to go with the 77 or the updated version.  Huh?  Huh?  Yeah, yeah.  So where are you, man?  Well, I'm in L.A.  I'm, you know, I got to go to work later, but I'm in L.A.  I got out of bed to call you guys.  It's an honor.  Thank you for having me.  We're going to get you in.  Uh, you know, that's, that's, uh, that's about all that's going on.  It's still early where he is.  Oh, it's still worse, dude.  When you call from L.A., it's fucking, you're half asleep. 
[02:58:00]  You're like, what's going on?  Yeah.  It's dark.  It's dark.  I just came downstairs in our house not to wake anybody up.  I thought you were in Compton.  What are you working on, dude?  You're always fucking getting gigs.  It's beginning to make me sick.  He's fucking booking everything he auditions for.  Oh, Anthony, by the way, hi.  I've never met you.  I met over here.  No, we've never met.  I've been ranting about you.  Yeah, he's been ranting about you.  Yeah.  No, what am I working on?  I just, uh, you know, I just finished that, that, that, that movie.  I sat down at the table at the cellar afterwards and Jimmy, after, you know, the movie was doing 
[02:58:30]  well.  And Jimmy turned to me and said, if you become a movie star, I will light your apartment on  fire.  I don't fucking need to see fucking Dove getting movie star accolades.  He's got that hot chick.  He's fucking got some stuff going on.  I'm fine with that, but the fucking movies with Mark, he brought Mark Wahlberg into the  cellar one night.  Oh boy.  And Chaz Palminteri and everyone else who won't even acknowledge me.  I got to get by Mark Wahlberg's bodyguard for a fucking photo.  I had to lie to his bodyguard.  Yeah, no, we're fucked.  Well, I told the truth, but I lied.  This is right before my canceled fucking failed endeavor of a television show went on. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, Amity Entourage premiere.  And I'm telling the bodyguard, like, yeah, we're following them.  They're our lead in show.  I'm trying to use Hollywood terms.  And I get near them and I fucking bug them for a picture.  And the bodyguard goes, you got me.  You got me.  The bodyguard goes, you got me.  Holy shit, really?  That was good, man.  You got me.  I was like, no.  He complimented your bullshit story to get past him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And fucking.  Oh, Jimmy Barrington.  Oh, is that great?  You got me. 
[02:59:30]  And, and, and, and Dove, did you, do you know, we talk about you a lot lately.  Do you know Chaz called in?  No, I didn't.  Oh, yeah.  I think I, I, I was, I had a thing with Chaz the other day.  I was with Chaz and he did tell me he met Chaz.  Chaz.  Chaz is a good man.  I mean, he's, he's just got something, he's got a real bearing, you know, there's almost  something, there's like a religious weight about him.  Chaz is a good man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got a lot of charisma.  He's got a good man.  He's got presence.  I told him how his friendship with you is, it, it, I'm jealous and it makes me sick and 
[03:00:00]  my goal is to ruin it.  Somehow.  I want to get in between fucking Dove.  What you do, what, what television show are you doing?  Is this like a series, man?  Yeah, no, I'm doing an hour long on NBC with Jeff Goldblum and Madeline Stowe.  Fucking, you working with Madeline Stowe?  Yeah.  How sexy is she?  Well, you know, I haven't, she's, oh.  She's, I've been, she's, she's, she's, apparently she's wonderful.  I haven't met her yet.  We shot the first three episodes and she just came on. 
[03:00:30]  Have you seen, she was in a movie with, with, with, with, uh, with, uh, Kurt Russell.  Unlawful entry.  There you go.  Big Kev, of course, knows the answer.  It's fucking unlawful entry.  And I jerked off through that whole fucking movie.  And then she came on because Kurt Russell looked good.  It was his dimpled chin and his gay brother.  Stop me.  Give me those ribs.  What was it about the movie that made you jerk off, Jim?  Hold on, let me smash myself.  Oh, I said his gay brother.  I meant Michael Douglas at a gay brother.  Oh.  I said Kurt Russell.  Oh, she's just, she's very sexy. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What is there to say, you know?  I'm not sure what the hell to say.  How'd you fall into, uh, this, uh, cause it looks like you're on the road to something  here.  To something fake.  Well, you know, I mean, there wasn't so much falling in as it was scratching and clawing  for the last time.  Yeah, you're working hard, auditioning, doing things like that.  Is that how you're meeting these people?  Yeah, I was trying to push that.  Sure, man.  I mean, you end up, I don't know.  It's just frightening to, I mean, to just be on the road as a comic, eh?  I don't know. 
[03:01:30]  It was a fucking, you build up a stiff self-hatred before you know it.  You got a pile of blood with a bunch of hookers.  It's a good time until you kill yourself.  So, I don't know what's going on.  He's telling the truth, too.  No, no, you're telling the truth.  Dove's fucking known for, this fucking guy has been on more trains than the average fucking  Amcrak commuter.  It makes me sick.  All he does is fucking just wave his cock around and it just, I just, I don't know whether  I want to cut it off or bronze it.  No, but anything I say took place prior to my girlfriend, because my girlfriend, you 
[03:02:00]  know, Roxanne, listens to you guys religiously.  I mean, she works in the house.  Yeah, she is a nice girl.  But everything took place, yeah.  I am, but no, look, have I been involved in the swing scene?  Have I been involved in the swing scene?  Yes.  The, uh, that's a, uh, you guys know one thing about the swing scene?  No.  No.  You actually, yeah, but I never really wanted, didn't you go to, you used to go to swimmers  clubs?  And this was before Roxanne, actually, I remember him telling me this.  Did you just call it a swimmers club?  No, I did it first, but then I realized I was getting, I was thinking of the fucking, 
[03:02:30]  the Susan Smith club that I want to join, which is the old, back those cock blockers  into the lake.  Um, no, what, what, the swingers club, you would actually go and get laid?  Yeah, no, downtown.  I used to go, I mean, about years ago I would go, and then it was, uh, you know, it's interesting.  I mean, you got to bring in, you got to bring a girl, though.  Yeah.  Well, I, you know, it's, uh, but, you know, they have a buffet, and, uh, guys can really  cut loose in that operation.  You get a nice buffet, you get a ziti, you lay down a thick, uh, vinaigrette.  It's a nice time. 
[03:03:00]  Sounds nice.  No, it's a, it's an interesting operation they run there, you know.  I mean, if you can just walk in, you make eye contact, you're halfway there.  It's a nice, nice time.  Did you actually get boxed in those places?  Like, you would just, would you just stand there and jerk off washing people?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've, I've, I've, you know, I've done that, but, um, you, you can  go into those guys.  I mean, it's, it depends who you have with you, but sometimes it's, it's a, it's, it's  an interesting operation.  Other times, you know, I place in Midtown, like a Bavarian ski lodge.  It's a bad scene.  It's a, a filthy operation there. 
[03:03:30]  But it's, uh, it's a decent time.  I don't know.  God, you have to be, I don't know.  Yeah, he's trying to save his relationship.  I know, he's a nice.  Hey, by the way, how is your old tenant doing?  No, no, I would never go with my girl.  I never went with my girl.  What are you saying, Jimmy?  How's your old tenant doing?  Oh, Roth?  Roth is, uh, Roth is good.  He's on the road.  He's doing, um.  You're Dave Lee Roth's landlord, aren't you?  I've heard, I know.  It sounds really strange.  Look, I, I got involved with a building years ago in a lower size, small building. 
[03:04:00]  It was stabilized.  And then, you know, an apartment came up.  Anyway, Dave ended up in a, in a spot there.  But he's, uh, Dave's a real piece of work.  So, well, we love him.  Believe me.  Uh, is he still, is he still renting from you?  Thank God for him.  No, Dave just moved out.  Dave is, uh, Dave's on his own now.  He's out with a band, right?  Is he doing something with the Bluegrass band?  Um, I am, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, doing some of his, uh, Van Halen songs.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, he's doing a lot of those tunes with some, with a, with a Bluegrass band. 
[03:04:30]  He changed our life, by the way.  Dave did, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Well, because he didn't have, his run was a little, there were some people that didn't  care for his run on, on, on Terrestrial.  So, like, when he, he was only there for a few months.  So, after he left, um, slash was booted, uh, we, we came in.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good time.  That worked out nicely for you guys.  So, we, why were you guys in the running for that in the first place?  Uh, they needed to fail miserably to think about us.  Yeah, we were so hated.  Oh, right, right, right, yeah, you guys had a beef over there. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, that, uh, there was no way.  That's one way to look at it.  No way.  That's a nice way to look at it.  Ass-fucking-in-a-church, there was an arrest, and 26 months off the air.  Yeah.  Like, you guys had a slight incident.  Yeah, there was some kind of a tiff.  Yeah, so, uh, they really needed, uh, there to be nobody left for them to choose, uh,  from, for them to, uh, put us on the air.  It was over, like, like, it was either shut down the company or hire us. 
[03:05:30]  Dude, when do you come back to New York?  Come back, probably over the holidays.  We get a break, I'll come back out there, and, uh, you know, we'll see what the hell goes  on with this show.  It's frightening what goes on.  I mean, you see these shows that go on, and, uh, what's that show, Smith with Ray Liotta?  I mean, it was a, they had the showrunners from ER, it was a, it was like a, it was  a class operation down the line, and those guys got yanked after two episodes.  Did they yank him after two episodes?  Ray Liotta had a show?  Three at the most.  Ray Liotta doesn't even get the respect to get two or three episodes and, uh, you know, 
[03:06:00]  let him, let him keep going.  Literally, and they had, they had shot, like, six.  They got two episodes.  At least play the ones you shot.  What pieces of shit the networks are.  Seinfeld did terribly in the ratings.  Oh, yeah.  MASH did terribly in the ratings.  MASH, number one in two biggest shows of all time.  Did Cheers do badly?  Did awful in the beginning.  Yeah.  Yeah, Seinfeld was weak up front, too.  Yeah, real weak.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  Dude, you should keep...  I guess you gotta hate it.  It's like those blockbusters.  You put X amount of money into the pile of so many millions, and if you don't hate it 
[03:06:30]  right up front, they yank it and put on a talk show.  You know what it is, dude?  It's all these young people that run Hollywood.  There's, like, younger people.  They're a bunch of cunts with low foresight.  So if something doesn't...  They're immediate, like, fuck, as Kevin Spacey said, MTV generation fucks.  And if it's not happening immediately, they just pull you because they're panicking for  their own jobs.  Speech!  Speech!  God, I'm like a bore.  Hey, dude, you gotta come in when you're in fucking town.  Just come in and hide with us.  I'd love to come in.  I'd love to come in.  Yeah, we'd love to have you, Dov.  Yeah, I'd love to come in.  I, you know, I don't know.  I genuinely have more to say.  I don't know what the fuck you're saying.  Someone is saying that you sound like Damone. 
[03:07:00]  Damone?  On Fast Times, yeah.  They want you to say, isn't this great?  Isn't this great?  Vic Damone's tremendous.  You know, that guy...  Vic Damone.  The other Damone.  That character.  Wait, is that his name?  No, Vic Damone's a singer.  Yeah, we're talking about...  Oh, right, right, right.  Who's the other Damone?  What was his first name at Fast Times at Ridgemont?  Oh.  Wait, Mike.  It was Mike.  Mike Damone?  Mike Damone.  Yeah.  That guy, remember when he goes into restaurants and gives the dude his wallet?  Yeah.  Gives the virgin kid his wallet?  Hey, you forgot this. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, this place is great.  I come here for the strudel.  And then he bites that thing.  Who knows he was in the strudel in high school?  Yeah.  He was too smooth, man.  He was too cool for the room.  Yeah, I come here for the strudel.  You're 16.  You come here for the strudel?  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I come here for the matzo bra.  Really?  16.  Hey, did anyone tell you that we had Sharon Osbourne in before? 
[03:08:00]  No, no, no.  What's she like?  Wonderful.  Really?  Yeah.  You know Jimmy's obsession.  Did Jimmy get some sort of strange?  Did she build up a heat for you, Jimmy?  No, she was just very nice.  Hey, Doug, before we let you go, do you have any stories about Jimmy at the cellar, like stalking  celebrities?  We all have one.  You know, the thing about Jimmy is he can often look like a stalk.  I mean, his skin is iridescent.  It's reminiscent of fishing bait. 
[03:08:30]  No, no, dude.  No, God bless Jimmy.  Jimmy's a...  You know, no, I don't have any specific stories.  I've seen him across the room of...  I have a story of Dan, you know...  Now, you guys don't know that of me.  Yeah, yeah, of course I know.  He hits on my chick every time he sees her.  He's so sad.  That's right.  Every time he sees my girl, he hits on her.  It's like, hello, when are you going to figure this out?  Yeah, Dan's got an interesting way about him. 
[03:09:00]  I don't know at what point he stole a chick off a varsity football player, but apparently  the guy's got a strange confidence that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Yeah.  But he often has eyes for another man's woman, but Dan is...  I was there with this girl I knew was a prostitute, and so I brought her into the cellar, and  you know, she had had a rough life, and I brought her down to the show, and she came  upstairs after my show, and she looked a little spooked.  She walked up to me, and she said some guy was staring at me downstairs, and made me feel 
[03:09:30]  uncomfortable, and I look up over at the bar, and she points out Dan.  And apparently Dan had some...  He was eyeballing...  Made a prostitute feel uncomfortable.  I don't know.  For a piece of her life.  But I don't know.  I don't have a lot of...  I got another story about Dan, but...  I don't have anything about Jimmy stalking.  Nah.  Well, the only time I did anything stalking remotely with you is when we did that table  read with Chaz, and I made you take the picture of me and Chaz, and Dub brought me in 
[03:10:00]  kind of like as a performer, and Dub just wanted to fucking shoot himself, but he was  a team player, because you're not supposed to go to a fucking read with ten people and  ask for photos.  No.  It's so unprofessional.  Totally unprofessional.  Totally unprofessional.  With a digital camera, yeah.  Yeah, it was awkward, but, you know, I Chaz didn't mind.  He was...  Dude, he was...  Guy, I'm sorry.  No, go ahead.  He was great, dude.  When he called in, I told him that I gave that read, and I'm like, I was so bad.  And I know I stunk. 
[03:10:30]  I was just atrocious, and he goes...  No, you weren't.  Oh.  He goes, no.  You were fine.  He was just so trying to say something nice.  He's a very nice guy.  Yeah, Chaz's a nice guy, and you weren't that bad.  Thanks.  I mean, I don't even think you were bad at all.  You were trying to...  Other voices you were doing, you were taking a chance.  Yeah.  I had to do three different characters, so I did them in different voices.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  Awful, horrid, and bad.  All right, dude.  Well, listen.  Definitely come in and hang with us when you're fucking in town, man.  We'd like to have you in the studio.  Okay.  Yeah, we just wanted to get you on the air and introduce you to the show, because I think 
[03:11:00]  you're hilarious, Dov.  We'd love to have you in soon.  Appreciate it.  It's Dov Davidoff.  Yeah.  Or Davidoff.  How do you say that last?  Davidoff.  Davidoff.  We pronounced Davidoff, yeah.  Davidoff.  Okay, sorry about that.  Don't worry about it.  All right, Dov.  Have a good time in LA.  Thanks again, guys.  All right, buddy.  See you soon, sweetie.  There you go.  Bye.  It's Dov.  Yeah, this chick's a huge fan of the show.  That's how they met, I think, right?  They met because of old Jimmy Norton.  She had come to a show and loved it, and then she wanted to come see me at the cellar,  I think, and I wasn't there.  And this 10 walks in wanting to come see my show, but then her and Dov met, and I guess 
[03:11:30]  they just hit it off.  And they've been together for a long time, now three years.  Ooh.  Hey, we ought to...  What?  Other things?  Yeah, we got to do a thing.  We ought to do this, because it's really...  Well, do we have people who are watching the show?  Are there any chicks watching these guys?  All right, listen, we're going to...  Patty.  Why don't we set it up?  We got to take a break, then.  Well, if we set it up, it...  Yeah, because...  Yeah, it'll ruin it.  No, no, no.  There's no...  Just bring in five guys.  Bring in five random guys, and we'll just do it. 
[03:12:00]  All right.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all we'll do.  We got...  How many listeners we got out there?  We need, like, five listeners to come in.  Eric, we'll do it.  Dude, we're going to just try a little something.  That's all.  Yeah, try a little something.  All right.  Yeah, turn those over.  All right.  We're going to...  Yeah, we got some little thing on this paper.  A little thing.  We'll do something with five listeners.  What?  Eric, five random listeners, okay?  All right, we're going to figure that out, and we'll do it after the break.  Kenny, you all right? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, you got five.  You got five?  Oh, good.  You all right?  Yeah.  I wanted some fruit.  Fruit.  I'm eating the fruit.  Fruit.  The tongue rolls.  Try these grapes.  No, I don't want grapes.  I want the kind of fruit.  Grapes.  Passed through you nicely.  I know they do.  All right, we'll take a break, and we'll do the thing with the five listeners, and we've  got a couple other things.  We're going to play some of the anti-show ads.  Like it.  There's some really good ones coming in already.  Blah, blah.  This is not what I'm used to. 
[03:13:00]  Here it is, live.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Nothing but foul language and toilet humor.  For the new listeners who think that we've learned our lesson.  Ah, ah.  Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.  Poopy.  Malarkey.  Tiny.  Cooley.  Let me titter.  I get it.  Someone pinch me.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  K-sirah-sirah.  Mumbo-jumbo.  Good natured joshing around.  Hoppy cock.  Poopy jokes. 
[03:13:30]  Silly.  Homina, homina, homina.  We just chit-chat and go nuts.  What do you think of them, Apple?  It's lame.  It's not even fun to listen to, you know?  I don't know how they could screw up something that simple.  Oh, ah.  But boy, they sure did.  Go me and Anthony.  All right. 
[03:14:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We're taking tomorrow off.  What?  It's cold in there.  Yeah, it's a little cold, too.  I'm a little chilly.  I've got to wear my puffy coat.  Don't worry, we'll be nice and toasty warm in Denver later, Jimmy.  I know.  But you know what?  It's actually going to be colder where we're sitting because it's closer to the nose of  the plane.  Oh, yeah, true.  I used my miles to upgrade.  You did?  I certainly did. 
[03:14:30]  I'm in first class with you.  Why Colorado?  I've got a family thing over there.  But why wouldn't they do the family thing in, like, the summer?  Because it's, like, the family thing now.  It's just something going on now.  And then we're going to be there anyway, so we're seeing Jimmy.  Yeah, it's going to be cool.  We're going to stay in the same hotel.  Taking them to see Jimmy.  Really?  Yeah.  Same room.  Me and Ant in one bed.  Ant's chick and my chick in the other bed.  And by my chick, I mean C.S. to the K. 
[03:15:00]  I've got a tall, dumb chick that I'm bringing with me.  A mopey chick who helps me sell merchandise.  Okay!  Isn't she lovely?  His life has been reduced to cutting strawberries for Jimmy and I every morning.  This is my lovely flower.  Thank you!  Sorry, but my girlfriend would be allergic to the dander that comes off that dry head of his.  He's in the back room cutting strawberries.  You know he wants to lop our heads off.  It's good, though, to have him there for the ride from the airport to the hotel. 
[03:15:30]  If we do get stuck and the tires start spinning, he could just scratch his head under the tire and get some traction.  Like metal shavings.  It was like the lathe shavings were dumped all over his head.  All right, we've got to bring in five listeners from the studio audience.  All righty.  E-Rock, five random listeners.  There they are.  Steve, you're not a listener.  I'm Steve and I listen every day.  I need to listen to make promos. 
[03:16:00]  You're barely an employee.  I need to make some promos for the show.  All right, we've got five listeners.  Hi, guys.  There they are.  One, two, three, four, five.  Cool.  There they are.  And Patty.  Patty.  All right, Patty.  Just stand there.  She had to be included.  Just stand there.  Make it so we can shut that door, you dopey.  Yeah, bring the Green Goblin fucking in.  Patty, what are you going to be for Halloween this year?  Green Goblin, please.  Patty.  What are you going to be for Halloween this year?  I don't know.  I can't.  Oh, why would that mic be on?  Yeah, why would the mic work?  That would be really silly. 
[03:16:30]  I don't know.  I can't seem to come up with an idea.  I have an idea.  At least you guys.  What?  How about a corpse?  A real one.  Oh, yeah.  That's really not nice, Jimmy.  Oh, that's not nice.  Why?  I didn't mean it.  That doesn't appeal to me.  What do you want me to do?  Really, I thought it would.  Why don't you go with like a little fairy or something?  Like a little wand.  You get wings.  Fairy wings and a little wand.  That's cute.  Yeah.  I'll see what Ricky's has.  Ricky's? 
[03:17:00]  That's where I go.  Where people get to go for your Halloween costumes.  Oh.  I got to go to Ricky's.  Ricky.  Ricky.  Ricky's.  All right.  All right, gentlemen.  All right, who do we got?  Who do we got?  Let's go start there.  You're Dean?  Yes.  From where?  Do they call you Brooklyn?  Big Dean?  Big Dean.  Dino?  Dino.  In Brooklyn, Dino.  Hey, Dino.  How are you?  Dean, Dean, the baby fucking machine.  Sometimes.  I mean, Dean, what part of Brooklyn are you from? 
[03:17:30]  Bensonhurst.  Bensonhurst, of course.  I lived right by you in Bay Ridge for a while.  You did?  Yes.  Nice.  We like you better when you're smiling.  Right by the ball field.  Very intimidating when you're not smiling.  Yeah, smile, Dean.  We're all happy.  There you go.  See, he's smiling now.  There you go.  All right.  And who's that guy?  Next, another big guy.  Joe from Staten Island.  Yo, Joe.  Joe from Staten Island.  Hey, Joe.  How do you do, Joe?  Joe from Staten Island connected to Brooklyn by a little bridge called the Verrazano Narrows Bridge.  We don't know much about Staten Island.  Yeah.  What's there to know?  Smells like shit.  The guy died making that bridge.  Fell into cement. 
[03:18:00]  Stupid fuck.  Always funny.  Next guy.  Bob.  You're Bob.  How you doing, Bob?  Rock on, Bob.  Bob should be standing in a pentagram.  Yeah.  Sacrificing an eight-year-old.  Oh, he grabbed his cock.  Attaboy, Bob.  That's what he does with the eight-year-old.  Teach her a lesson first.  All right.  And you are?  Sam.  You're Sam.  Hello, sir.  Any occupation?  What do you do?  I'm a line cook in a restaurant. 
[03:18:30]  You're a line cook in a restaurant?  Yes, sir.  What does a line cook do?  I cook for a living.  That's it.  You have to go, yes, chef.  Yep.  Yes, chef.  All the time.  Because I watch that Chef Ramsay show there, Hell's Kitchen.  You audition for that or anything?  Nope.  No?  You got no aspirations to a television or anything like that?  Yeah, I do.  Just not into it.  Not into that show?  Nah.  You have any hobbies?  Kits in his ass?  No.  No.  What do you do, Satan's child?  DJ.  You're a DJ?  Yeah, Bob made like a little face when he said cook. 
[03:19:00]  Bob was like, ugh.  DJ on the radio or DJ...  Uh, like bars.  Bars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Still actually a little hungover from last night.  Yeah, I hear you.  What kind of music do you play mostly?  Metal.  Metal, I guess.  Metal.  Yeah, metal.  That's pretty cool.  You want to plug the place you're a DJ at or what?  Uh, actually, uh, 151 Rivington.  That's the name of the bar, 151.  Where is it?  It's at 151 Rivington.  Well, where is that? 
[03:19:30]  On Rivington.  Actually, it's the Lower East Side, south of Halston, east of Essex, I guess.  Okay.  There you go.  That's still a scary area down there.  I live down there, yeah.  It's all right.  You're a brave man?  He's all right.  You're a brave man?  They leave him alone.  Gats' Deli.  It fits in.  All right, cool.  And you, sir, what do you do?  I have a printing shop.  Printing shop.  Mm-hmm.  That's good.  You own it?  Yeah, me and my dad.  Porno?  No.  No?  No.  What do you print?  Everything.  What fucking year is this? 
[03:20:00]  Business cards.  Business cards?  Color, forms, anything, brochures.  Color is bone.  It's a raised font.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, all that stuff.  No printing.  I thought that was like, done.  Well, we've been there 30 years, so.  Yeah.  All right.  And finally, what do you do, bro?  I'm movie producer, writer.  Yeah?  Director.  Yeah?  Independent film company.  Director.  But whatever business may need my help, I'm there to offer assistance in Brooklyn.  It's a Brooklyn film company, you know?  Brooklyn film company.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's a front for a murder.  What is it? 
[03:20:30]  It's a conversation going on.  All right.  Anything we would have seen or known of?  We have a movie coming out, our first feature full length.  It's Last Night in Brooklyn.  Last Night in Brooklyn.  It's called, yeah.  And what's the gist of that?  It's a gangster movie.  It's a gangster movie.  It's kind of a love story, comedy kind of thing.  All right.  Anybody we would know?  No.  And the website is?  CipherProductions.com.  How do you say that?  Spell it.  C-Y-P-H-E-R.  Production.  Cipher.  Okay.  Cipher.  Cipher.  Nice.  All right.  Well, so we got one, two, three, four. 
[03:21:00]  We forgot this dude here.  Oh, hey, dude.  What's your name?  No, Steve.  Tony.  What a fool Steve is.  He gives the mic to the same guy he just talked to.  Yeah.  And what do you do?  I am a security officer.  All right.  I guess the jig's up here because some of his friends just texted him.  Some of his friends just text you?  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw that.  Stupid fucking asshole.  Good old Sergeant Magoo.  How you doing? 
[03:21:30]  Who was it?  Sergeant Magoo.  Sergeant Magoo.  Sergeant Magoo is now banned from any fucking thing ever, ever.  That is pal talk, fucking message boards, everything Sergeant Magoo is banned from.  What did he text you?  What did he text?  What did he text?  He just said, don't bomb.  Don't bomb?  Yep.  What were you supposed to bomb at?  I have no clue.  Why is he texting you?  Why is he texting?  Why is he texting?  He knows he's on the show.  Well, don't bomb isn't bad.  Don't bomb.  Let me see the phone.  Steal his phone.  Don't bomb is fine. 
[03:22:00]  He's going to suck on the show.  Wait, so you're, yeah.  So you know all those guys?  You know these guys?  Yeah, I know all the guys in pal talk.  And you do?  What do you do?  Pal talk.  Everyone knows the pal talk.  Are you guys, any of you guys message board people?  Pal talk.  Message board?  You ain't got no message board names or anything like that?  Just pal talk?  What do you go to the live room, watch the show, usually during the day?  Because I know I go on there sometimes even like 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock at night and the  live room is still fucking rocking.  What's the craziest thing you guys have seen in the pal talk room?  I don't know. 
[03:22:30]  You know, mostly baby girl.  She's fucking sus.  Everyone loves Marissa.  Of course.  Yeah.  There she is.  What about you?  What's the craziest thing?  You guys see anything crazy on there ever?  No, just lots of naked girls and...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Still waiting on pal talk to come out for the Macs.  I'm a Mac user myself.  Yeah, they should have a fucking Mac compatibility.  Yeah, they ought to.  I don't know what they're waiting for.  Pal talk, come on.  Snap up.  Get with the Mac.  The camera's right there on the fucking laptop.  That'd be nice, right? 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  I'm having trouble converting to my Mac.  I got a Mac laptop.  I'm trying to put all my fucking iTunes and shit on it.  But Mac's a motherfucker with that stuff.  It's like they won't let you convert anything.  It's like you got to change the little end of the file name.  I don't want to.  It's as easy as that sometimes.  And because I know, like I said, I go on pal talk a lot.  A lot of weird, wacky shit goes on on pal talk.  Anyone ever get lucky?  Ever pick up any girls off of there?  Because I know Jimmy.  Yeah.  Jimmy has. 
[03:23:30]  Get lucky?  No.  No?  What about you?  I'm married.  You're married.  You're doomed.  So you not only didn't get lucky, but life stinks.  You ever get lucky?  Mac.  Right.  Just open up the laptop and slam your cock in it a few times.  He's a fucking DJ, man.  He don't need pal talk to your pussy.  He just fucking plays the right tune.  He's rocking the right tune.  He's done.  He's fucking headbanging.  He just fucking slips or something.  Yeah.  Ever good ass raping?  What about you, Sam?  No luck.  Just into a lot of Kool-Aid.  Oh, that's it? 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's that mean?  I don't know.  It's an inside thing on pal talk.  Yeah.  No picking up girls, though?  You don't use it for a pickup spot.  No.  What's the Kool-Aid thing?  Is it something?  I'm guessing it's a fucking...  Let me guess.  Does it mean like that you're a...  Something about like you drink the Kool-Aid as far as the show, like being a fan of the  show?  No.  I don't think so.  Of course I do.  It's people that...  You can't embarrass me in front of everybody.  No need.  People that what?  No, it's just people that are into other people, and I go to say hello and shit, and  everyone says, yeah, hey, you're dipping into my Kool-Aid, so I become the Kool-Aid  man. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, I kind of...  Wait a minute.  What's dipping into my Kool-Aid?  Because you talk to other chicks, other guys' chicks.  Yep.  Yeah, I've heard about that.  With him?  I don't know if it's him or not, but I've heard...  Well, you trying to bang other guys' chicks?  No.  I'm not saying that in an accusing way.  I don't care.  No.  And you, sir?  No, not at all.  Pal Talk, you ever pick up anybody?  No.  Things like that?  I'm awful.  No way.  You look like a sweet boy.  Thank you, sir.  I want to shave his head and face and then put baby oil all over him. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  All right, we've...  Warm baby oil.  We've talked to the five people in the studio, and all we have to say, looking at everybody,  is one person here, right now, after that questioning, is a liar.  What?  One of these people is a lying sack of shit.  Oh, no.  Who could it be? 
[03:25:30]  Hey, can you guys hear that music?  Are you lying, sir?  You're not.  You're lying about anything you've said?  No, I'm not.  Are you lying about anything you've said?  Not at all.  Are you lying about anything you've said?  I hope I'm not.  I hope I'm not.  What does that mean?  Are you or no?  I don't know.  No.  Not that I know.  You don't know, but no.  No.  Are you lying?  No.  No.  Sir?  No, sir.  Are you lying?  You don't tell Phibs.  No.  You don't tell Phibs. 
[03:26:00]  And what I mean by lying is about the picking up chicks on there, or maybe doing stuff on  Pal Talk, other than, oh, wait, wait, someone's head just tilted back and hit the wall.  And wow, is he turning red.  Okay.  Four guys.  One, two, three, four.  You can all leave.  Hey, Sam.  Why don't you stay in the fucking room?  You guys can leave.  Thank you for playing along.  Yeah.  You might not need that wool hat. 
[03:26:30]  You seem like you're getting a little hot.  Why don't you come up, take a seat in front of the big microphone.  Why are you getting hot?  Yeah, why are you all red and embarrassed?  Why do you think you're in the studio right now?  Let me see if you can predict the future.  I don't want to know.  You don't want to know.  Right when you accuse these guys of being liars, this guy, he just mumbled to himself,  oh, shit.  Well, I'm Sam.  Hi, Sam.  How are you?  What's going on, guys?  Yeah.  Well, what do you think is going on right now? 
[03:27:00]  I don't want to know because I do not want to incriminate myself.  You don't want to incriminate yourself.  Can I say that?  But you think there might be a story here.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  In relation to what?  I don't know.  I'm going to live in the dark.  I don't know.  You want to share anything, Sam?  Maybe you want to share something before it gets shared.  Wait, is it something with the Kool-Aid thing that you mentioned?  I don't care.  Let it out.  Has there been an instance, an occasion where perhaps you have hooked up on PalTalk? 
[03:27:30]  No.  No.  You've not gone with somebody, maybe gone private with somebody in PalTalk?  Hmm.  Eh.  Eh.  Has there been an instance where perhaps there was some sexual exchange over PalTalk? 
[03:28:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  So we got a yes there.  Okay.  It's fine.  And, well, because people do that all the time.  We certainly do.  And was there masturbation involved?  Oh, boy.  I know where this is going.  You do, do you?  I don't think you do.  Where?  I'm not going to say it.  You're not going to say it?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  I'm a little lost.  Okay, Jimmy.  All right.  Where are we at here?  Don't be embarrassed.  So what, man?  You say I never fucking talked to a girl and masturbated? 
[03:28:30]  So what happened?  You talk to somebody and masturbated?  Okay.  Big deal.  Well, I'm hearing it wasn't a private room.  Was it actually a public room?  Are you insane?  What do you mean?  Wait, wait, wait.  You told people you were masturbating in a public room?  No, I didn't tell anybody.  You were jacking in a public room.  Do you know what happens when people jack in public rooms?  I found out.  How'd you find out?  And what'd you find out?  That you take a beating when you do so, when people catch you. 
[03:29:00]  Take a beating while you're beating it.  Okay.  Not only a beating, Sam.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah.  What you were, you told people.  I didn't tell people.  Then how'd they know?  How did they know?  I got hunted down and was found.  You got hunted down and was found?  And you think this is because of that drinking other people's Kool-Aid kind of thing?  I have no clue.  Where were you doing this?  I'm not sure.  I'm not on Palto that much.  I'm on, but not that much.  What room was it?  Yes.  I don't remember. 
[03:29:30]  What room was it?  Oh, jeez.  Somebody.  You jacked in here.  You jacked up.  Naughty couples.  In the fan room?  No.  Is it possibly naughty couples or something like that?  Oh, okay.  And sexy singles.  Yeah.  And dirty dares.  You could have been, right?  All right.  Well, it's not just...  You know what happens in public rooms, though?  Uh, you ever hear of little programs that, um...  Screen cap.  Screen cap. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's all hold up our pictures.  There you go.  Let's all hold up our pictures of Sam jerking off in one of the public rooms.  Sam, is this indeed you?  Is this indeed you?  Yes.  Yes, this is you.  Sam, um...  Wow.  That is...  That's not much of a cock you got there.  I hope that's not...  Oh, poor Sam.  I hope something... 
[03:30:30]  Now, were you jerking off in a meat locker?  Perhaps that could be an excuse.  Wait, he's not jerking off here.  He's holding a fucking...  A shell-less snail.  Were you in Denver?  Just kind of out of a pool, perhaps.  Well, wow.  That's your name?  Uh, is that your name on there at the bottom?  Yes.  Your pal talk name?  Here's the room.  Naughty couples and sexy singles and dirty dares. 
[03:31:00]  Dirty dares.  Did someone dirty dare you?  Yes.  Did someone say to you, I dare you to tug on that until it's a man size?  Oh.  Were you also in the orgasm room?  No.  No?  What's the orgasm?  The hams are us orgasm room.  What is that?  Or something.  In the orgasm room, someone sang.  I guess there's a girl here that maybe you were...  Was on the other end of this...  The receiving end of this picture. 
[03:31:30]  Person that's IMing me, were you on the receiving end of this fine picture of Sam?  Was it you that he was doing this to?  Uh, no.  Okay.  Who were you?  Was it somebody from the fan room?  No.  No?  Just a random...  Yes.  You were just one of these guys jacking off?  Random guy.  Like you pop through the cams and you just see guys jacking?  You weren't talking to anybody?  No, I was.  Who were you talking to?  I don't remember her name. 
[03:32:00]  I don't.  All I know is I hate all my pal talk friends right now.  No, they're not friends.  Well, and believe me, this is a black and white printed picture, so it's very grainy and  very hard to see.  The pristine color photo is amazing.  Amazing to see.  Sam, didn't you think maybe...  Do you have two accounts?  One for jacking, one for being...  No, learn that the hard way.  No, no, no.  Well, the not very hard way. 
[03:32:30]  Well, congrats.  You know what?  Everyone does what they got to do, and I got busted, so you know what?  You got busted.  Take it for what it is.  That's it.  That's all.  Are you going to be changing your name?  No.  No?  Why not?  You're just going to deal with it.  A little bit of history.  I love the idea that everybody can see your cock like that.  Here's what I'm going to do.  Sunday when I get back from Denver, Jim Norton is going to be jacking in a room.  I'll tell you what room.  I'd love to have my cock screen capped.  If somebody wants to do that, God bless you.  You want to screen cap Jimmy's cock? 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  Photoshop it.  Make it black.  Well, foul talk is just blowing up with you.  Oh, I could imagine.  You've been pwned.  Hey, Marissa.  We got Marissa on the line?  Oh, Marissa.  Oh, Jesus.  Hello?  Hi, baby.  There she is.  Hi.  Hi, Sam.  Sorry.  Everybody put me up to it, though.  It's okay, hon.  Wait.  Marissa, you did that?  Did what?  You screen capped him?  No, I did not screen capped him.  But you received the picture? 
[03:33:30]  Yes, I did.  From somebody that was in the same room?  There was a few people in the same room.  A few of the fans in that room?  Yes.  And they recognized his name and went back and said, oh, my God, this guy's in there jacking  right now?  Yes, and they did an invite to all.  Invite to all?  So, like, a shitload of the people from the fan room then went into this room to watch  you jerk off, and a bunch of people screen capped it?  Yeah, I got woken up at 3.30 for it.  Did anyone video cap?  I'm sure there is. 
[03:34:00]  I just haven't gotten it yet.  Holy shit.  Oh, Helen Ferrisking.  Wow.  You guys are bad to each other, man.  Yeah, you really can't get away with it, especially under the same name.  Yeah, word of advice, which, pick a different name.  Take a different name.  Were you, was anybody impressed by what he was doing over there?  No, actually, I think he got me fun of.  Yeah, it was a lot of people making fun of.  Do you remember any words that were being used for his penis? 
[03:34:30]  Um, no, but what happened was actually somebody actually congratulated him in the room for  helping out, and one of the fan room people called him out on it, too.  Really?  Mic'd up right after.  Oh, they did?  Yep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you knew you were caught then, but you just didn't know that we had, we were onto  it.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Well, there you go.  Hey, isn't that what Pal Talk's all about, though?  Just getting on and jerking off.  Take it easy, Marissa.  Thank you.  This guy works in a restaurant and handles food. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you're a line chef.  If the people on Pal Talk know the restaurant, it's going to go out of business now, because  no one's going to go there.  Well, we wouldn't want to ruin his reputation as a cook, so we won't say anything like that.  He washes his hands after he checks.  He's jerking off in the strudel.  Employees must wash hands after jerking off.  Sign in the bathroom.  Did you ever look at Marissa and Scrap?  I have.  No.  Come on.  I can't believe anything you're saying now.  That's fine. 
[03:35:30]  There's those days where Marissa's just sitting in her chair with only the little boy shorts  on.  How do you not jerk off that?  You've never spanked to that.  I have.  But you've jerked off in a public room that's pretty much 99% other guys jerking off.  I have respect for the fan room.  I don't believe him.  Sorry.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice.  You're jerking off to Marissa.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice.  Get the slipcovers clean.  All right, Sam.  Where do you do that? 
[03:36:00]  Just like in front of your...  Where's your computer?  In my room.  In your room.  Mm-hmm.  You got some paper towels there.  Mm-hmm.  He's just mortified.  The slow one-finger type from one hand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Well, thank you, Sam, for playing along.  Not a problem.  That was good.  You could go back on PalTalk now.  Do we have to keep these pictures?  We should.  No, I think...  Can you sign them for us?  We can burn all those.  We can get rid of these.  Here, take that. 
[03:36:30]  Come wipe up something with us.  Thank you, Sam.  Sterilize those headphones, please.  How do you not jerk off looking at Kara or Marissa?  I fucking scrapped the both of them.  But he wasn't in that room.  But I won't do it in public.  I'll just watch them.  They show their tits.  Oh, the guy.  Look at him.  He's all slumpy.  Oh, don't be sad.  Wow.  As he walks out of the room.  Walking out, everybody's kind of shaking his hand.  Oh, ew.  There's a lot of waving going on.  Well, once again, thank you, PalTalk, for setting that one up.  Jesus Christ, you are a bunch of fucking animals. 
[03:37:00]  I jerked off to Lucci's sleeping once.  Jesus.  She is a sleepy one.  She had no idea.  She wasn't facing...  All I saw was covers moving and a little head facing away, and I fucking repainted my stomach.  Oh, wow.  Hey, we were going to try to get to this earlier.  Fox 5 story on negative political ads.  Yes.  We'll lead into the political ads about the Opie and Anthony show, and then we're going to get out of here so you guys can catch a flight.  How does that sound? 
[03:37:30]  Sounds good.  I like it.  They say politics is a dirty business, and judging by some recent campaign ads, it's never been dirtier.  Bada bing.  We're in it.  But deep.  And worse, this guy Tom Kane, he wants to clean things up.  Even cut taxes.  Hey, where's our take in that?  They've reached a new low in smear campaigning.  It's just, you know, and I disagree with it totally.  I think they should do something.  I think it shouldn't be allowed.  The minute you see them, you almost feel like one's just trying to downplay the other person, so you're not really focusing on what they're saying. 
[03:38:00]  It's just terrible campaign tactics these days just to get votes.  Often, political action committees, independent of any candidate, run the nastiest ads, like the anti-Bob Menendez Sopranos spoof.  But listen to this Senate campaign ad in Tennessee, where Democrat Harold Ford is mocked.  I met Harold at the Playboy party.  We took money from porn movie producers.  I mean, who hasn't?  Harold, call me. 
[03:38:30]  Pretty lowbrow stuff, and the ad directly from the Republican National Committee, one the GOP's own candidate thinks is over the top.  We think the ad is tacky.  We think it's not senatorial.  We think it has no place in this race.  See, here's what the politicians do, which is, it amazes me.  They put out these ads that are so despicable and so negative and just mudslinging.  Then they get on and say how horrible it is that that ad is running and it shouldn't be running. 
[03:39:00]  Well, then have it taken off.  Should it be called mudslinging at this point?  It's more than that.  It's cum-slinging.  It's cum-slinging.  They're cum-slinging right in your face.  And shit-slinging.  Right.  The way Migs threw it, right at your mouth.  Oh, we can't get enough of it this year, though.  Bob Menendez said, I can smell your cunt.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson. 
[03:39:30]  Who's his opponent?  The guy we love?  Ron Kahn.  Ron.  Ron Kahn.  Ron.  See, it makes you remember his name.  Yeah, yeah.  He's wrong.  That ad does nothing but make you remember the candidate's name.  Ron Kahn voted to tuck your dick between your legs and kill a senator's daughter in a well.  Oh, I love those ads.  All right.  So the listeners threw together some ads.  The call is out to the listeners. 
[03:40:00]  Put together negative campaign ads for people on the show.  And we got three that are worth playing today.  Make sure you send them in to Steve or Danny.  Danny at foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  We got a couple examples that are working pretty good.  Also, I think the info is up on opianthony.com.  Here's the first Opie and Anthony political ad.  Anthony Cumia has a very big secret. 
[03:40:30]  Do you really want your favorite radio host to be someone who aligns themselves with Nazi Germany?  Anthony Cumia admitted this himself.  I'm into Nazis.  Let's hear that again.  I'm into Nazis.  And one more damning time.  I'm into Nazis.  Paid for by the friends of Billy Burr. 
[03:41:00]  When did I yell I'm into Nazis?  When haven't you?  During Schindler's List?  Now they can just clip when did I yell and you'll have another I'm into Nazis.  There you go.  There it is again.  Oh, Jimmy.  So there's the first one.  Very good.  I don't say things that are going to damage my political career.  No.  Like you'd never hear me saying, yeah, my name's Jim and I suck cum.  You know, a listener, a listener, Jim, might take that clip now and twist it around and use it against you. 
[03:41:30]  You've got to be careful because there are guys who will go, yeah, give me ten bucks.  I'll let you fuck my mother's mouth while she sleeps.  People might use that in an ad that you're trying to take money.  With what you're saying on this show.  And sell off your mom like that.  Oh, I don't know.  You've got to watch.  You can't say things like that.  Like, use me as a cum dumpster.  You know, because people will use it.  See, we disguise your voice like that. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, through the almond filter.  Nobody knows who you are anymore.  Now I can be whoever I want.  Go ahead.  I dare you to isolate this.  Give me a load.  But I'll swallow.  Here's the next Opie and Anthony.  I did a lot of gay references today, by the way.  I apologize.  Go ahead.  Opie and Anthony show political ad.  Martini Steve is incapable of expressing emotion.  Why not?  Martini Steve has no feelings. 
[03:42:30]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Time and again, Martini Steve has proven that he doesn't have what it takes to be an actor.  James Norton has a track record of successful, long-running television series like Tough Crowd  with Colin Quinn and HBO's Lucky Move.  James Norton has what it takes.  Please hire him.  Message paid for by MBSD Entertainment and David Steinberg.  That's not bad.  That's not bad. 
[03:43:00]  Tom S. in Boston.  The first one, by the way, about Anthony was Jared in Boston.  Could have used some of the clips, though, that you had there.  But I wouldn't come on these airwaves and say things like, the Amber Alert System should  be called the Tattletail Alert System.  Yeah, I agree.  You got to be careful what you say.  Because a friend of mine once said, I dominate blacks because that's what I do. 
[03:43:30]  And that could come back to haunt him.  You know?  Oh, got to be careful.  Oh, but you're not kidding.  From your lips to God's ears, you got to be careful.  You got to be careful and say things like, why can't we bring back whites and colored  water fountains?  Or things that you don't mean.  Oh, my God.  Well, see, I would never say something like that because it could be taken out of context  and used against you.  How about take two on that, though, is what I'm getting at.  No, I like how nervous I sounded saying it.  You were clipped. 
[03:44:00]  You put the wrong tense in.  Whites and black.  And colored.  Black only.  I'm very sleepy.  It is sleepy.  And I have a flight into goddamn Denver.  But you're as sweet as the day is long.  Oh, thank you, Jimmy.  By the way, David Steinberg is my manager.  I was watching Seinfeld the other night.  Yeah.  Fucking Jerry and Jace Alexander were peeking around in the Friars Club.  They go, oh, there's David Steinberg.  And he goes, the comedian?  No, the manager.  Yeah.  And then they go, like, they're all disappointed.  Yeah.  I wouldn't be.  Finally, the last political ad for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:44:30]  This is the last one for today.  And we hope to get a lot more by Monday.  Before you head to the polls this November, Steve C. would like you to know a few things  about his opponent, Anthony Cumia.  Did you know that Anthony Cumia doesn't like black people?  In fact, he lives in one of the whitest neighborhoods in greater New York City.  And though he may be surrounded by Jews, it's a known fact that Anthony Cumia is a Nazi. 
[03:45:00]  And during a recent skit on the Opie and Anthony program, Anthony played the part of Senator Mark Foley.  Kid toucher, you decide.  Steve C. speaks with perfect enunciation and inflection.  Steve C. has never had a girlfriend placed in a loony bin.  Steve C. cares about the environment.  He drives a hybrid, not some flashy Mustang. 
[03:45:30]  Steve C. cares about the environment because he lives in the environment.  Grr.  For by the World Wildlife Fund, Steve Irwin Treasurer.  That's the one to beat right there.  That's a good one, man.  That's the best one so far.  We just want some clips.  If they have clips, we would love to get clips in there.  It's always so funny when they're out of context.  That guy had the music down, though.  That whole ominous music where you're talking about the opponent. 
[03:46:00]  And then the very patriotic Steve music.  Steve.  I live in the environment.  Grr.  Grr.  Very good, guys.  That was John in Hartford.  Very good, John.  I have a feeling he might be in radio.  Yeah, that was very funny.  His voice is a radio voice.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Are we ready for line of the day?  Yes.  Line of the day.  I want to plug the Comedy Works, by the way, this weekend.  Maybe at one of the shows, you may not, but I will be there at Denver. 
[03:46:30]  I am there.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Of course.  And New Year's Eve at the Bogada, and November 10th at the Hammerstein.  And it's been a fun show, man.  And, uh...  Wait.  Well, you know what?  And...  What?  I got to thank my friend, Big Kev, who is doing me the favor of a lifetime.  He is getting my Peter Criss picture signed.  And...  He'll be...  Where are you appearing at?  I'm going to plug you, whether you like it or not.  I'm going to be at that chiller convention this weekend. 
[03:47:00]  And they can check it out at chillertheater.com.  Okay.  The extensive guest list.  Very nice.  Get us the Warriors!  I'm going to try to get people for the show.  I'm going to do some interviews while we're there.  Oh, you're doing some of your interviews?  I want more fucking Big Kev interviews.  That is great.  You're crafting these into a fine segment, sir.  I hope to get Pee Wee Herman as the big guy.  That would be a good one.  That would be nice.  Yeah.  Big Kev has a one-minute interview, and 30 seconds of it is,  So, hi, I'm Big Kev, and you're doing a film produced by Warner Brothers.  And what can you tell me about that film, which was shot in Technicolor? 
[03:47:30]  Time's up.  Guys, eight seconds.  Ah, it's a good movie!  Good movie, indeed.  Well, I'm Big Kev, and that was Pee Wee Herman.  That's right.  Paul Rubens.  Being dragged away by his publicist, like the fucking Apollo guy.  Jesus Christ.  Maybe if you said, I'm Kevin, and I said your last name,  I said, I'm Big Kev.  Because that doesn't sound official.  Yeah, but, you know, that's the character that I have, so, you know.  Okay.  Got to stay a character, like Mr. Ivan has. 
[03:48:00]  Two quick phone calls in line of the day.  Hey, how you doing, Ron?  Ron Vegas, go.  Quick phone call.  Hi, Ron.  Let's walk on board.  Go.  What?  I tell you, we're going to need a bigger bell.  That the inappropriate bell?  We're going to need a bigger bell.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Chris on Long Island.  Chris?  Oh, hey.  I want to do a What I Learned for the Week.  Is your off tomorrow?  Yeah.  I learned that Stephen Hawking has a small hoo-ha.  We don't remember that, except I remember them talking about it. 
[03:48:30]  All right.  Well, thanks.  Chris, me now.  Goodbye.  No, it might be us, actually, so we'll let you slide.  Yeah, we're not sure.  We might be just a little tired.  All right.  Line of the day, sponsored by Bodogfight.com.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S.  in a bout against the Russians.  It's all on Bodogfight.com.  A mixed martial arts tournament and docu-reality unlike any seen before.  Go check it out for yourself, okay?  Vote for the line of the week at iliketolisten.com.  Yeah.  Okay.  Very good.  I'dliketolisten.com. 
[03:49:00]  Check that out every once in a while.  Make the sponsors happy, please.  Squeezy, Sam.  Yeah.  All right.  That's all the excitement I've seen Sam show in a fucking year.  He got really riled up there.  Yeah.  His fucking right arm moves.  See?  Yeah.  Meh.  Here is the runner-up line of the day.  Look, man, it's all about getting some press.  I'm sorry.  That's what she's doing.  She's getting a lot of press on her phone.  She's getting a ton of press.  You know, her star isn't as bright as it used to be.  Neither are her kids.  Honored for another runner-up. 
[03:49:30]  Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.  That's all right.  Always the bridesmaid, but you never wind up with an anchor tied around you, do you?  And finally, here is today's line of the day.  Here comes...  Comes what, Jimmy?  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[03:50:00]  Maybe that little sniveling snitch goes with the mother to not want another one running  around the house.  Yeah, really.  Nice kid.  Annoying, whining little child.  It's your fault.  I want another one of these.  Two pieces.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I stepped on that line.  I didn't even realize that.  Oh, that's okay, man.  Her little thing got ripped out in two pieces.  To what?  Jesus.  All right, good. 
[03:50:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  And can we thank our guests?  We should thank our guests at the end of the show.  But, Obi, I like to do guest thanking time.  It's when the credits are rolling.  Oh, I don't know.  What do you think?  Oh, well, I want to say, um, Jim Belushi, it was very fun having Jim in and plugging his  book called Real Men Don't Apologize.  Mm-hmm.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Jimmy, it's too late in the show.  And I want to thank, why did he keep doing the same bit? 
[03:51:00]  You know how painful that is late in the show?  Like, it's 610 when we have energy, we got our coffee in us, who cares?  But after five hours of radio, that goes right through me, man.  Makes me want to jump out the window.  I just want to go home and I have to wait for that long pause.  It kills me every time.  And.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  And Sharon Osbourne.  She was great. 
[03:51:30]  She was wonderful.  Her book is, uh, it's fucking good, man.  I'm being really honest.  She's not hearing it.  Is that the title?  Yeah, it's called It's Fucking Good.  Oh, okay.  It's fucking good.  I love it.  Idle and George playing the New York Improv tonight at 8 p.m., I guess.  I'm getting a little communique about that.  Elmo, anything, Brother Elmo?  He's wearing the Hogging Up the Airwaves t-shirt, the Fatty Pig Fatty t-shirt.  That chick looked exactly like the back of the shirt.  The one I was in before.  The big puffy, um, piggy, um, look. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  Let me see.  Yeah, the big llama foot, too.  But, uh, yeah, if you come down to FH Riley, what's the guy's name?  Paul R. Johnson.  Yeah.  No, all.  Nelson.  Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  There he is.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Hockey dad.  Oh, he's a.  And gook killer.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[03:52:30]  Hockey dad and co-  Hockey dad.  Hockey dad.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, Hockey Dad and Colonizer.  No, not really.  I liked it better when I fucked it up.  At least I had an excuse.  But then once it came out crystal clear, it just plain old fell flat.  That went over like a lead balloon.  Back goes Griffey, looking up, and it's out of here! 
[03:53:00]  Or is it? No, it's all for long.  My mistake.  That went over like a lead balloon.  I'll keep saying it.  So what's the plug?  So you go home.  Just say anything that these two guys said, and you'll get Halloween tickets as long as I got them.  Paul R. Nelson, you want them to say.  Yes.  Paul R. Nelson.  They got to say it in some kind of voice.  They can't just say, I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[03:53:30]  And you only get one shot, so if you don't do it, that's it.  And you're fucked.  If you walk up like Master Poe, hello, gentlemen, this is Paul Nelson.  Hey, I'm Paul Nelson.  I'll be fucking out back.  Yes.  Poe will fuck it up.  Hi, this is Paul R. Nelson.  You vote for Ron Kind, you're going to be Pwned.  Pwned.  You didn't like that one, him?  Master Pwned.  No.  Oh, I didn't hear it.  That was right.  Damn it.  Say it again.  I'll hear it in the replay. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, Sam.  Wow, I'm trying to make him say it again.  All right.  I said, Master Paul will screw it up and come up and go, hi.  I'm full R. Nelson.  Oh, because he's into the martial arts.  Yeah.  It's like a physical.  It's a hold.  It's a hold that people use.  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  All right.  M.H. Riley's Friday, Saturday, running to Brother Elmo late because he sleeps all day, 
[03:54:30]  and he'll have Halloween tickets in his back pocket.  Right?  Yeah.  Thanks for throwing me under the bus there, pal.  400 New York Avenue, Huntington Village, my bro's place.  What do they have to say?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Let's hear him say it again.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Okay, it's more nasal.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  No.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  If it helps, pinch your nostrils between your thumb and forefinger.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[03:55:00]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Shut up. 
[03:55:30]  What's that guy's name again?  I don't have no idea.  Who knows?  It slipped my mind.  By the way, that's going to be in people's heads all fucking weekend.  You think?  You'll be fucking your girl going, oh, my God, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Shut up.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[03:56:00]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Motherfucker.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Enjoy the bumps to Denver, boys.  We're on a 737.  That'll be fine.  Yeah, I'm sure that's not even a problem.  I don't care.  Bumps don't bother me, I'm telling you.  You guys are just lucky that weather doesn't go from west to east. 
[03:56:30]  Doesn't?  I don't care if it does or not.  No, it really doesn't.  Right around Texas, it goes south.  You go around it.  So you're lucky.  You go around it, over it.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about the bumps.  I never care about the bumps.  I'll tell you why.  Because, um...  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  And I'm a hockey dad.  I'm used to bumps.  They're on my son's ass when I finger it.  All right, all right!  Can we go home?  I'm a hockey dad.  Hockey dad.  What the fuck is that?  All right. 
[03:57:00]  All right, I'm going to get up and leave.  Will that get us...  Remember the days when we would end a radio show professionally?  Like a professional operation.  All right, we'll be back on Monday.  We're going to have blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Have a great weekend.  Have a good weekend.  Pshu, pshu.  Pshu, pshu.  Lasers.  And now it's like, uh...  I guess I'm just going to have to start this and get up and go.  It peters out like a party.  Like people just kind of leave.  And you're left there with like three people you don't want to be with anymore. 
[03:57:30]  Or drinking the beer.  That's flat beer.  There's two people left and you're like, why are they still here?  I can't go to bed until this idiot gets off that couch and goes home.  Just leave.  You just leave.  All right.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson is a cunt.  I hope we don't hear this later today.  This is your captain, Paul R. Nelson.  We'll be flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet. 
[03:58:00]  If you look out your window, you'll see the great state of Wisconsin.  I'm running for congressman.  Vote for me, Paul R. Nelson.  You're a pilot.  You're a congressman.  Fuck.  Now batting.  Number 22.  Paul R. Nelson.  Nelson.  Wait, he said the last name right.  Oh. 
[03:58:30]  Hold on.  What?  Nelson.  Nelson.  One small step for man.  One giant step for...  Paul R. Nelson.  I hate this name.  Paul's the new pat battle.  Going through the thing.  Going through the thing.  Any more we can think of?  I'm... 
[03:59:00]  Uh-oh.  They might have one.  I'm...  Ick benign Paul R. Nelson.  Ask not what your country can do for you, but rather what you can do for Paul R. Nelson.  Down goes Paul R. Nelson.  Down goes Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I know.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  No, I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[03:59:30]  Shut up.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R.  I'm Paul R. Lynn.  Give me some poppers and a cock.  I'm...  I hope Paul R. Nelson  has half of his colon removed.  His fucking intestines  should just have a rock attached to them.  This is a day that will live  in Paul R. Nelson. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah.  Someone's doing the  full metal jacket.  All I ask for my marine.  All I've ever asked  of my marines is to obey my orders  as they would the word of Paul R. Nelson. 
[04:00:30]  Paul R. Nelson  tear down that wall.  Everybody.  His name was Paul R. Nelson.  His name was Paul R. Nelson.  His name was Paul R. Nelson.  Ladies and gentlemen, 
[04:01:00]  I have to inform you that  Paul R. Nelson  has been shot and killed  in Dallas, Texas.  Paul R. Nelson  is dead.  God damn rich.  Paul R. Nelson.  old school.  That's a good one.  Yeah. 
[04:01:30]  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, my brother's writing.  Ooh.  He knows history, so.  Stupid history.  I knew Paul R. Nelson.  I knew Paul R. Nelson  and you are no  Paul R. Nelson.  Your days of  finger-bagging  or  Paul R. Nelson  are over. 
[04:02:00]  The power of  Paul R. Nelson  compels you.  The power of  Paul R. Nelson  compels you.  Paul R. Nelson  wins the pennant.  Paul R. Nelson  wins the pennant.  Wait, okay.  Paul R. Nelson.  The white angel.  Let's get crazy.  You, me, Betsy.
