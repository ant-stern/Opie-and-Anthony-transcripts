<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a highly energetic and vulgar "F.U. Friday" extravaganza.  The show opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with frequent guest Jim Norton (present for a significant portion of the broadcast), launching into a series of sexually explicit discussions and jokes.  Planned segments included a "MILF" contest with a Myrtle Beach trip as the prize, and the deployment of the "Freak Box," a device designed to capture unscripted, often sexually explicit, footage from AllTrue.com, positioned outside a Hooters.  The best footage from the Freak Box, which was also used at a New York club resulting in negative media attention (porn stars engaging in sexual acts within the box), would be posted online. Dewey and John, the Freak Box's creators, were interviewed and defended the device.  The hosts also heavily addressed listener criticism from Chicago, accusing them of plagiarism regarding their “Whip Him Out Wednesday” segment and the use of Stephen Lynch’s “Special Olympics” song, playing Lynch's song to highlight the similarities.

A significant portion of the show revolved around the Freak Box, featuring sexually explicit descriptions of acts captured on camera, both at the club and outside the studio during the broadcast.  The show also included numerous "F.U. Friday" listener calls, venting their frustrations.  A call from Boston Herald reporter Laura sparked a long discussion about the hosts’ past employment, their firing from WBCN, and near-misses with Clear Channel and other stations, including airing grievances against former program director Dave Douglas.

The Little Kings, a band composed of little people, were guests. They performed live in-studio and outside, and were interviewed extensively about their band and experiences. A listener compared them to Mini Creed. The hosts played their music and showed photos.  The show also featured a discussion about a bottle rocket being fired from a woman's vagina, described graphically.  Opie recounted receiving a pornographic videotape, "Explosive No. 4," from his brother-in-law, Johnny Race, containing explicit gay and heterosexual content. The "Moms I'd Like to F Contest" was mentioned, along with a pre-recorded bit of the hosts impersonating Ronald Reagan making sexually suggestive comments to the Reagan Library staff.  Old Dirty Bastard (ODB) appeared as a guest, delivering rambling, crude, sexually suggestive observations about current events and pop culture.  The hosts graphically discussed the possibility of a woman performing a “Cleveland Steamer” on Jim Norton during a future Cleveland show.

Scotty Crane, son of Bob Crane (Hogan's Heroes), was a significant guest, appearing in multiple segments.  He promoted his website and book detailing his father’s life, including his extensive collection of homemade pornography from the 1940s-70s.  Scotty showed the hosts explicit photos and videos of his father engaging in various sexual acts. He addressed rumors about his father's death, including mob involvement, and refuted claims about S&M and non-consensual acts. He also mentioned a "Bob Crane Jr." disputing his legitimacy as Bob Crane's son.  The conversation included details about Bob Crane's career in radio, early experimentation with sound and editing, and open lifestyle in Hollywood.  The segment featured explicit descriptions and images of sexual acts, discussions of Bob Crane's penis size, and comedic exchanges between the hosts and Scotty Crane.  A comedic pre-recorded bit about Bob Crane's death and home videos was also played.  The interview with Scotty Crane was interspersed with "F.U. Friday" listener calls and commercials, including one for Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.

A particularly chaotic segment involved two female guests referred to as "retarded Laverne and Shirley," along with Scotty Crane. The segment featured displays of Bob Crane's pornography, discussion of the Freak Box (a Hooters girl reportedly entered it earlier), crude jokes, sexually explicit comments directed at the women, and repeated requests for them to flash their breasts. The hosts insulted and belittled the women, leading to their ejection from the studio and a declaration that it was their final appearance on the show.  The remainder of this segment included listener calls, promotions for events (including New York Sports Clubs and a Spinal Tap concert), and Jim Norton's comedic observations.  The overall tone of the broadcast was extremely vulgar, confrontational, and sexually charged throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour, by Opie and Anthony, serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island, this is 1027 WNEW, New York. 
[00:00:30]  I'll beat up a check for you.  You're not gonna do it. You're not gonna do it. You're not gonna do it. You're not gonna do it.  Okay, watch this.  Baby, get out of here, twat. 
[00:01:00]  Stupid friggin' twat.  This is a turn-on. Go for a poke.  I'm hoping to show you how serious I am.  How'd you like to suck my egg?  Howdy, faggot.  You son of a bitch.  I don't know why I just did it right.  It's Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  Friday! 
[00:01:30]  Hey, everybody! We're all gonna get laid!  We're in a sink!  We're in a sink!  She was a hoo-er.  Marijuana is the bomb.  Sweet, emerge-able crap!  Here's your appointment!  What the hell were you thinking? 
[00:02:00]  Your balls are healing.  How's that for a topper?  This place blows.  I thought I told you to shut up.  Hey, who's the stripper?  Noise, noise, noise.  Smoke and weed, smoke and weed.  Full-wing coke, shake your beers.  Pack your ass, my gun, man.  Time to kick back, take some beers, and smoke some weed.  Timber!  Timber!  Timber!  Timber! 
[00:02:30]  Nice face.  Vagina.  Vagina.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Friday edition.  Friday edition.  It's F.U. Friday.  That's right.  We'll get into that in a little bit.  Toll-free, 877-692-1027.  We have an action-packed show today, my friends.  Ah, yes we do.  In the studio, Jim Norton, stopping by to say hi.  Not.  We have Scotty Crane coming in today. 
[00:03:00]  Nice.  Bob Crane's son.  Yeah.  Going to talk about all the porno that his father was into.  Also, we got the Little Kings setting up outside the studio as we speak.  The Little Kings.  They're called Little Kings because they're little people that rock and roll.  Very nice, Opie.  Very politically correct.  That was good, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  And we're going to be taking all sorts of pictures for WNAW.com so it makes sense to you. 
[00:03:30]  Because if you're driving in your car, you're going to hear a band that rocks.  But what's interesting about them, they're all under four foot tall.  Right?  Absolutely.  Saw that on my way in.  Also, Anthony, the MILF contest continues today.  Moms, I'd like to F.  Yesterday, the contest shaped up nicely and we're expecting more moms to come down today  to get their pictures taken to be in the contest with, of course, a grand prize of a trip to Myrtle Beach to give away. 
[00:04:00]  Nice.  And we have other things to give away to second and third place.  Yeah.  What else?  Oh, the Freak Box is set up outside Hooters.  What the hell is this about?  Rick, grab the mic and explain Freak Box.  If you're in the area, this is going to be really, really cool.  And if you're not, it's okay, too.  Because once again on the Opie and Anthony Show, we share with you guys.  So you'll be able to see what we're doing outside Hooters at a later date, right?  Yeah.  Basically, if anybody was reading the post a couple weeks ago, remember at, what was that club, Ben?  Spa?  Yeah, they had a big write-up about this Freak Box where people were inside it canoodling. 
[00:04:30]  Canoodling.  Doing stuff that you wouldn't normally see people doing.  Well, what?  Having sex or something?  Okay.  Having some sex.  Having a little lesbian action.  You know, kind of doing some confession stuff.  And it's going to be set up throughout the day right in front of Hooters on 56th Street between 7th and Broadway.  And people could show up starting now.  Yeah.  We're going to send a bunch of people from the show down there to hang and stuff.  We're going to try to get down there maybe with some cell phones as well. 
[00:05:00]  And there's a camera in there.  There's a camera in there.  Everything's going to be videotaped.  The best stuff that they record will be put up on the website so everybody can check it out.  So if there's something you want to get off your chest, you can hide your face or something.  But you can, you know.  It's your chance to be a star.  Yeah.  Right.  Whether you want to show what you've got under your clothes or you want to say something stupid.  Whatever.  If you've got a quato somewhere on your body.  Oh.  Quato.  Well, maybe we could get Sandy Kane in the freak box.  Freak.  Freak. 
[00:05:30]  I'd love to get Paula Poundstone and the Olsen twins in that.  Oh.  Hey, that's a good combination.  My new favorite person.  Paula Poundstone.  I love her.  I love her.  I love her.  Gotta respect that.  Also, we've got to address a couple things really, really fast.  Yeah.  We're finding radio message boards now that we're syndicated to a bunch of cities.  Yeah, there's a bunch of people in Chicago trashing us.  And then there's a bunch of people, like, sticking up for us.  Yeah, there's a little battle.  Message board battles.  Happens all the time. 
[00:06:00]  And a couple things we just want to clear up real fast.  We're not going to spend a lot of time on this.  But it's kind of hard to fight back when, you know, your show's on in the middle of the night in Chicago.  But we'll give it a shot anyway, okay?  Two things.  Opie and Anthony came up with the idea of Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Yeah.  It's a known fact.  We can show you articles that go back six years.  This is the seventh season we're doing Whip Him Out Wednesday, which is the concept where you put WOW in your car,  WOW bumper sticker, homemade WOW sign, and then the ladies, if they feel like it, will flash. 
[00:06:30]  We were hugely successful in Boston with that.  We're hugely successful with that in New York.  And we've been doing it a long, long time.  If you can find any documented evidence that anyone has done that before, we did it.  You just won't.  There were national articles on it.  I mean, you know, you can't make believe that, you know, you came up with it when we have proof that we did it first.  Yeah, absolutely.  Because Man Cow in Chicago, I guess he started up a couple summers ago. 
[00:07:00]  And everyone thinks now that we're in Chicago, we've only been on the air, what, two weeks?  Look, they're stealing WOW from Man Cow.  They're stealing WOW from Man Cow.  No, no, it's the other way around.  Sorry.  Sorry, but your hero stole that from Opie and Anthony, okay?  And a second thing that was mentioned on the Chicago message boards is a song called Special Olympics, Anthony.  You want to explain the Special Olympics song?  Special Olympics song, Stephen Lynch, very talented.  He's on our show a lot.  He performed that on our show live.  And then a little while later, a year later or something like that, yeah, it was a year later, 
[00:07:30]  Man Cow plays it.  Not only does he play it, he plays the same version that was taped on this show.  You hear your pals Opie and Anthony in the background laughing.  Laughing.  Like little schoolgirls.  And he played it on his show and made believe that, you know, this happened on his show, blah, blah, blah.  And he got a lot of publicity from it, I guess, because it's a little controversial song about the Special Olympics.  But it was done. 
[00:08:00]  The one he played was done on this show.  Right.  I want to play that version for you right now.  There you go.  Listen up, Chicago.  Stephen Lynch says he has a nice song for us because he was listening to Corky Steinbrenner a little while ago.  I want a corn dog.  This just reminded me of a song.  All right.  Special Olympics.  See, when Man Cow played it, he decided to take that little intro out and go right to the song, Anthony.  Yeah.  See how it's done in the radio world?  Mm-hmm.  It goes a little something like this. 
[00:08:30]  Corky.  I go.  Watch them run.  Pretty.  Watch them fall.  Oh, there they are.  Watch them try to catch a ball.  Olympics.  Special Olympics.  Oh, boy!  Watch them laugh.  Watch them drool.  Watch them fall into the pool. 
[00:09:00]  That's diving.  At the Special Olympics.  You're such a pity.  And I know full well  That I will burn in hell  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball  Gotta be about the funniest freaking thing I've ever seen in my life  At the Special Olympics 
[00:09:30]  At the Special Olympics  Special Olympics  Take it, Corky!  At the Special Olympics  Oh, you're such a pity  You can sing at my wedding when I get married 
[00:10:00]  Oh, my God.  Done!  Ho, ho!  That's right.  Unemployment line.  Here we come.  So there you have it.  With Anthony doing the Corky impression.  By the way, the CD skipped.  It wasn't...  Oh, this is a brand new copy of this?  Yeah.  Yeah, good job.  Good job.  It skips like crazy.  It skips.  Great job, John.  Oh, well.  But that's it.  You know, it was performing here.  Yeah, there was a couple skips in there by here. 
[00:10:30]  So we just wanted to clear that up  because we were kind of, you know,  trolling around some of the message boards around the country  and that's what we noticed on the Chicago one.  Right.  Just clearing the air, right?  And pools.  No, it didn't get dumped.  No, it didn't get dumped.  The CD skipped.  Why could...  What's wrong with the old version?  Well, no, we were compiling all the O&A sessions on the one disc.  Right.  There must have been a glitch on that particular one,  so we'll have to re-burn it.  All right.  Toll-free, 877-692-1027. 
[00:11:00]  Now we can move on with the regular show here, Anthony.  Yes.  Are we doing another Wow! sticker stop today?  No.  Oh, no.  Okay.  No?  No sticker stop today?  What's Earl going to do today?  He's going to check this out.  Earl has an appearance.  Black Earl has an appearance today.  He has an appearance tonight.  Absolutely.  Wow.  Yeah.  Bogart's in Long Beach.  I was supposed to do it, but I had to back out because I had previous plans.  I'll do it.  And, yeah, basically they called on Earl. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, my God.  What's he going to do?  He's all excited, too.  And I'm like, Earl, it's a beer night.  You don't even drink beer.  Yeah.  Dude, everyone, all the salespeople are all laughing.  I said we should just tape it, you know, and we can play it.  Oh, we should get some audio tape on what he's doing.  Make sure we get a dat recorded down there,  because I've got to hear some of this.  What a night of excitement with Earl.  It's just going to be...  I wish I could make it.  That'll be fun. 
[00:12:00]  So when are the Little Kings going to...  They're going to do a quick sound check,  and then they'll be right at Rock.  All right.  And we're going to send someone downstairs for the Freak Box outside Hooters?  Yep.  That's on 56 between 7th and Broadway.  Yeah.  It's going to be a nice crowd out there.  It'll be a place to be this afternoon.  It'd be great to drop a stink bomb in there, wouldn't it?  What, in the Freak Box?  We just take a dump?  No, just drop a little stink bomb,  so the next people in there are really, like, uncomfortable,  and it ruins it for everyone.  We've seen some of the video from the Freak Box.  It's pretty hot.  So we're expecting some hot things to happen.  Yeah, girls get in there. 
[00:12:30]  Touch each other.  I saw some threesome footage.  Saw some yesterday.  Nice.  Right here on the couch.  All right.  Earl will be at Bogarts Long Beach, Long Island tonight at 10.  Okay, so why don't we take a break?  We'll get the Little Kings in here.  When is Scotty Crane coming by?  Between 4 and 4.30.  All right, very good.  Let's go to the FU line.  Thanks for calling, and this is the Opian Anthony FU Friday line.  Do you hear this?  Do you f***ing hear this? 
[00:13:00]  This is what I've got to do with every day.  I've got a f***ing construction site outside my window.  I can't sleep.  I can't do anything.  I've got laid off from my job.  I'm unemployed, and I've got to sit here at home, try to find a job, listen to this f***.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big FU to my boss.  He keeps jerking me out of money.  I keep doing extra work, and he's not giving me the money at the end of the week for it.  He owes me $250, and he keeps telling me, oh, I'll give it to you next week, next week.  Next week never comes. 
[00:13:30]  So FU.  Next message.  Uh, hey, this is Rob and Marty.  We'd like to give a big FU to Rich.  A f***ing loss in us last night.  Not once, but twice.  So Rich, FU.  F*** you.  End of message.  Anthony, Sam Adams.  Sam Adams, I love it.  We drank it yesterday on the show, and some of the lovely ladies, the moms, that were coming  down and posing in their lingerie started drinking some Sam.  Well, that fueled the lesbian couch yesterday. 
[00:14:00]  Before we knew it, there were three of them on the couch going at it and drinking icy  cold Sam Adams.  Fourth of July coming up, and what are you going to do for your party?  Put out the same old boring beers?  No.  Get some Sam Adams in that cooler.  That's right.  Sam Adams.  The lead instigator in the American Revolution.  Did you know that?  Samuel Adams was like the head muckety-muck guy, the lead instigator of the American Revolution.  Signed the Declaration of Independence. 
[00:14:30]  Sam Adams, the beer, led its own revolution back to quality and great taste.  How far are they going to stretch with that whole thing?  Sam Adams.  All I know, I love it.  Drink it all the time.  Get yourself one.  You're out at a party or buying beer for the house.  Sam Adams.  Catch the best of O.B. and Anthony.  Saturdays, 11 to 3.  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[00:15:00]  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  Lots going on around here.  We've got the Little Kings setting up outside the studio.  We're going to get them in here to hang with us for a while.  And they're going to play some songs, man.  Play some tunes.  They're the world's shortest rock and roll band.  Is that the, Bill?  They're, what do they call them?  Little people, O.B.  A lot of people just say midget.  Or dwarf.  They may be dwarfs.  I don't know.  I don't know what it is. 
[00:15:30]  I don't know the difference.  Are they dwarfs or are they midgets?  It says in their bio, dwarfs.  Dwarfs.  Don't call them midget, then.  So we have that right outside the studio.  Down on the street today, outside Hooters, which is 56th between Broadway and 7th, we have  the Freak Box set up.  And that's where you guys should go to hang out today for the show.  We're going to have Jim Norton down there.  Basically, this Freak Box, you go in and do whatever the hell you want.  You want to get naked?  You want to have sex?  Yeah.  Or if you just want to speak your mind, whatever. 
[00:16:00]  I'm just horrified because I'm picturing a bunch of guys going in there to just spank one out.  Ugh.  We'll get some ladies down there.  We should get that whole band and put them all in there and let them run around for a  little while.  Because any...  Little instruments.  I remember any time...  That would be fun.  I remember any time you'd go to the web, especially early in the web with cameras and stuff,  and you'd go to these sites, live cams, and people would have cameras in their house.  And you're expecting, all right, I'm going to log on.  I'm going to troll around and find some girl, you know, having fun with herself or something. 
[00:16:30]  99% of the camera links, what was it?  Guys cranking it.  What the hell is that?  Put a guy in front of a camera, he becomes a monkey.  We'll get some good stuff today.  All right?  We're going to have a bunch of us down there.  So, outside Hooters, show up now and hang, and it'll be a good time, all right?  All right.  Angela, real fast.  Oh, the Boston Herald is on the line.  Oh.  First Angela.  Angela, what's up?  From yesterday.  Yes.  Hi.  One of the girls that was on the lesbian couch with the other two moms. 
[00:17:00]  I wanted to know how come you didn't post my other picture that you took.  What other pictures, Angela?  He took a picture of me and the song and that thing wrapped around my waist.  Huh.  And I had no bra on.  I was covering my chest with my hands.  Well, what the hell is that?  Where's that one?  I don't know.  I'm upset.  I didn't put those up because those came in in the second batch and he put up the first  batch first.  Yeah, we've got to get the hottest pictures possible of these moms for the moms.  Try to put one of those pictures up, please.  All right.  We'll get that one up there, Angela. 
[00:17:30]  Angela, the email today, unbelievable.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Some people saying the best radio show they ever heard.  Really?  Good.  Yeah, you kicked the ass.  The three moms on the couch just completely going at it.  Unbelievable.  Great.  All right.  That's good.  Thanks, Angela.  She was very sexy yesterday.  Yes, she was.  Laura.  Yes.  Hi, Laura.  Laura, how are you?  How are you doing?  Laura.  I miss you guys.  How are things up in Baston?  I just had a big kick-ass Aerosmith concert last night. 
[00:18:00]  Nice.  Laura?  Yes?  We're on in many markets now, so you're going to have to bear with us because we want everyone  in on this story we're about to tell, all right?  Okay.  So, first of all, why are you calling us?  Well, because on our guest book, on our email, on our webpage, that annoying piece of  crap that it is, somebody has posted that you're going to be joining the WBCN family  full-time.  Ah.  Beginning on Monday, sources of WBCN say, that is not true. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, no.  We don't know if they'll ever be on this radio station.  Oh.  Who said that?  Yeah, who said that?  You know, that ball guy.  Who?  Who said it?  Oedipus said that?  No.  Who said it?  A guy.  Tony?  A guy.  Just a guy said...  A guy.  You know the guy that I'm talking about.  She means Oedipus.  Oedipus.  She means Oedipus.  No, Oedipus isn't there.  In fact, nobody is at WBCN.  Right.  See, she's just protecting our source, but I am led to believe it's Oedipus. 
[00:19:00]  See, a lot of people...  Well, you lie in there, because it's not Oedipus.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, we'll stick with the facts.  All right.  Do you want a scoop today, Lori?  Yes, I would love one.  We have some good stuff for you, for our Boston listeners.  Well, that's what you always say, but then you never...  No.  You're just like a man.  No.  Oh, not the...  What men have you been with?  We got some good stuff for you today.  All right.  Everyone knows that Ant and I, we did quite well in Boston, and then we got fired for saying  that the mayor of Boston died in a fiery car wreck.  And who defended you? 
[00:19:30]  Not many people.  Did you?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  And it was said we shouldn't have been fired for it.  It was an April Fool's joke that went horribly wrong, obviously.  It went awry, is that right?  Yes, and we landed on our feet here in New York, and now we're syndicated to Philadelphia,  Chicago, Dallas, and Cleveland and Columbus coming next week.  Cleveland?  And Sacramento coming next week, as well, spreading the virus.  All right, so when does this cancer spread to Boston?  Well, we've been out of the Boston market for three years, which just amazes Ant and I. 
[00:20:00]  Just amazes us.  No brainer.  When we flipped the switch here at NEW, we should have also been on at the same time  in Boston in some capacity.  Infinity's got a bunch of properties up there, and we should have been on one of them in  afternoon drive.  Yeah.  For some reason, I think they deemed us out of control, I think it was, for the first  three years that we were here.  They said we were too out of control to be syndicated.  So we waited and waited.  Then...  Why is that a bad thing?  What?  To be out of control and be syndicated. 
[00:20:30]  If you want to syndicate, you're out of control, people.  That's what we were trying to tell them.  Not your boring people.  That's what we were trying to tell them.  They didn't bite until our contract was almost up.  That's right.  This is where the story gets really interesting.  I hope you got a pen and paper handy.  I'm writing like feverishly here.  And you know we've never lied to you, right, Laura?  Laura?  Yeah.  We've never lied to you.  Move on.  Go ahead.  We may have kept some facts from you.  We've never lied.  Okay. 
[00:21:00]  Go ahead.  We've never lied.  Go ahead.  The contract came up.  Yeah.  And now they're starting to scramble because, oh, oh, our dance card's a little more full  than it was before.  There's other companies vying for Opie and Anthony.  Right.  Laura, here's a great scoop for you.  What?  All right.  Clear Channel wanted to hire Opie and Anthony.  Ah.  No secret.  Right.  They wanted to put us on in mornings to go up against the big guy.  No secret. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  It was very important to us that we get an outlet in Boston to do our show.  Mm-hmm.  No secret.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Well, the fine folks that were working on this deal behind the scenes approached a radio  station up there.  Mm-hmm.  A Clear Channel radio station.  No.  No.  Actually, no.  They had some limited properties up there and not many slots on the stations they did  have that we would be appropriate on.  So they kind of farmed out a couple of stations, a couple of opportunities for us. 
[00:22:00]  Uh-huh.  And they came across one that we were a little familiar with.  Uh-huh.  W what?  Uh, it was either, can I say the call letter?  Sure.  It was either AAF or WFMX.  Bing, bing, bing.  Bing, bing.  A-A-F.  Now, one of them was WAF.  Yeah.  And it should be noted here, hopefully, if you write this article, that Anthony and I  still, to this day, have not talked into that douchebag Dave Douglas. 
[00:22:30]  He scourged.  Who didn't even stick up for us when we were fired for the mayor's prank, okay?  Right.  Not a word.  Not a word to see if we were going to be okay.  Nothing.  Yeah.  He just covered his own ass, made sure he wasn't going to get fired, and pretty much  sold us down the river.  That is no secret, and he hasn't talked to us to this day.  Right.  Second-rate PD, wants to be a player, never will be, and the real talent behind the scenes  that actually he took credit for a lot of the stuff for was John Ostelin, the Ozone. 
[00:23:00]  The Ozone, man.  As far as getting a lot of the bans and negotiating with people and talking like a real human being,  that was all Ozone.  Okay.  And Dave Dickless' true colors will come out when he doesn't have Ozone to fall back  on anymore.  Okay.  That being said.  Well, no.  We're getting to the whole story.  Very important.  This gets better.  This is gripping radio.  It is for a bunch of people.  So, it was presented to us that we would do mornings, if we went to Clear Channel, at 
[00:23:30]  WAF.  And Dave was okay with this.  Dave was going to move Greg Hill, either fire him or move him to another slot to make  room for us.  And we were going to do mornings at AAF.  Wow.  One stipulation.  Dave wanted to finally talk to us.  And I said, no.  We would never go there as long as Dave Douglas is the PD over there.  Uh-huh. 
[00:24:00]  Can't stand him.  That's a huge...  But guys, WAF is not owned by Clear Channel.  It doesn't matter.  That was the station they were going to have us go on.  They're owned by that other company.  WMMR in Philadelphia.  They wanted us for mornings as well.  That's not a Clear Channel station, either.  But that's how big this deal was getting.  Wow.  They were scrambling in these markets.  All right.  But now that we're hurt on WYSP in Philly, now MMR is trashing us.  Because they're sore losers.  Because they didn't get us in the end.  All right.  So now...  Hard question again. 
[00:24:30]  But you don't find that interesting that Dave...  I find this fascinating.  That Dave Douglas was going to either fire or move Greg Hill to bring us in?  Now, but guys, you know I have a personal relationship with Greg Hill.  Well, that's fine.  We like Greg, but the bottom line is Dave Douglas was just going to, you know, toss him out of  mornings at AAF.  Basically treat Greg Hill like he treated you.  Exactly.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Because he's a worm.  A spineless worm.  All right.  And to make it more interesting...  Bottom line...  Wait, to make it more interesting, Greg Hill just signed, you know, re-signed with AAF at 
[00:25:00]  the time.  So...  Yes.  When are you coming to Boston?  Oh, yeah.  That was the question.  We need you here.  Yes.  We need extreme talk.  We want to be there so bad.  And we want to follow you.  Here's the quote that you can put in the paper for tomorrow.  We want to be on WBCN.  We want to be heard tomorrow or Monday in Afternoon Drive on WBCN.  But quite frankly, the station still doesn't get what Ant and I do.  Mm-hmm.  They're scared.  They don't really know how to handle us. 
[00:25:30]  They don't know how they're going to sell this product.  So they're kind of...  What would you call it, Ant?  Kind of...  Well, if they sell the big guy, why can't they sell you?  Exactly.  What they want to do...  That's a no-brainer.  You know, there's been a long, illustrious rock heritage there at WBCN.  Yes.  You bring us in, put us in Afternoon Drive, it kind of...  It's an end of an era, pretty much.  You can play music.  We don't play music anymore.  That's what they...  I know, but you did.  You could do it. 
[00:26:00]  No, we can't.  You're Renaissance men.  You can do it.  Hey, Laura, Laura.  We're syndicated now.  How many markets are we in that are on talk stations exclusively?  People are going to sit through music that BCN plays.  We do a talk show.  This is where we are bumping heads with BCN.  We want to be on.  We think it's the future of BCN.  You know, the music industry right now sucks.  And if you put us in Afternoons at BCN, we're going to kick some ass.  Guaranteed. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, so they kind of want to put us in nights, extend the show so they can add music,  because it'll be a tape delay show if it's on at night.  We're not happy with that.  The interesting thing, the company has given WBCN 90 days to figure it out,  and if they can't figure out anything that we're all happy with,  then we're allowed to jump to FNX or one of the other stations.  And now the 90 days is down to about 61.  Yeah.  So, Laura, we could have pretty much answered your question with this. 
[00:27:00]  Yes, you did.  No, we could have answered your question with this.  What?  Instead of going through all that crap.  We will not be on WBCN Monday.  On Monday.  From 3 to 7.  No.  But you'd like to be.  But we needed to kind of air our dirty laundry to you in Boston today.  Absolutely, we'd like to be.  And I am the laundress.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I'm glad that you guys took my call.  No problem.  Yeah.  And you should check out our guest book.  All right, we will.  Check out our guest book.  We miss you.  What's the guest book again?  Our listeners love guest books. 
[00:27:30]  Go to BostonHerald.com.  Click on the inside track.  Then click on Talk Back to the track.  All right.  View the guest book, and it's right there.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Are you going to print any of what we just said?  Yes, I am.  Oh, look at that.  Yes, I am.  Okay.  It's not a wasted call.  All right, Laura.  Thank you.  Bye, tweets.  Bye.  There she goes.  There it is.  From the Boston Herald.  I like that.  She asks one question.  We fully intended on answering it, but we had to get all that other dirt out there. 
[00:28:00]  See, and I hope this isn't boring to Chicago and Dallas, but we worked for a PD that  was such a dick, such a wormy little bastard that was a sneak behind the scenes, never stood  up for Anthony and I.  And when we got into some serious trouble, wow, the dwarves are ready to play.  When we got into serious trouble, he just turned his back on us and sold us down the river  and hasn't talked to us since.  Yep.  Deke.  Worm.  That is like huge news for Boston. 
[00:28:30]  I hope she prints it.  She got an exclusive right there.  Yeah.  Tyler, what's going on?  Yo, I just want to say that MMR sucks.  Thank God you're on YSP.  They wanted us as bad as YSP did.  Did they really?  Yeah.  It's pretty funny because behind the scenes, what's going on in Philly, MMR is trying to  trash us to all the advertisers.  Meanwhile, they wanted us so bad.  Oh, well.  I can't stand them.  I've never listened to them.  As far as I'm concerned, YSP is Philly Station and I'm a diehard listener.  Right on, man. 
[00:29:00]  All right, Tyler.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  A lot of people checking in.  Holy F.  The midget sound check, checking the bass is freaking me out.  Yeah.  It's so loud out there.  Anthony, we got a little clip of our old douchebag program director from Boston.  Yeah.  This is Dave Douglas.  Yeah.  We did a little bit.  It was about a couple of gay guys on those old Volkswagen commercials with the da, da,  da.  Right.  Remember that?  And we did a little bit on it.  Dave Douglas always used to hotline us and tell us to stop doing things like that. 
[00:29:30]  This was another one of those calls.  He called up to tell us we shouldn't be doing this kind of stuff.  We taped his call and then cut it up in the studio and put it to music.  Totally twisting around the meaning of his call.  Yeah.  This is called da, da, Dave.  Our idiot PD just calling us in the middle of the show to tell us to stop jack off.  Hello.  Hello.  What's up?  I just wanted to...  Why are you on this line?  Well, I figured it was easier than getting out of my chair and coming down the hall. 
[00:30:00]  Oh.  I just wanted to make a request.  Yeah.  Maybe we could steer the show in a little different direction so that this doesn't get out of  hand.  What's getting out of hand?  Well, I think we're going into the gay zone and we all know where that leads.  Wouldn't you agree?  Not really, but...  Pokey pokey in the butt.  No, no.  Licky licky.  That's fun stuff.  Yeah, it's fun, but you know what?  It's going to get us in trouble. 
[00:30:30]  Just, you know, steer somewhere else.  If you keep going this direction, it's going to be trouble.  I'm just warning you.  Not from me.  I'm talking about outside.  We've been down this road before.  The old dirt road.  Yeah.  Just giving you a little heads up here.  All right.  Okay.  Head.  See ya.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Hello.  Going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay zone.  We're going into the gay zone.  Wanted to, you know, pokey pokey in the butt. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Oh.  Gaze, gaze, gaze all.  You know, pokey pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Oh.  Licky, licky, licky, licky, lick, lick, lick, lick.  The old dirt road.  What you doin', what you don't.  Yeah.  Licky, licky.  The old dirt road.  Licky, licky, licky.  What you do in the dirt road.  What you do in the dirt road.  I'm just going into the gay zone.  Yeah.  Going into the gay zone.  Not really.  Going into the gay zone.  Wanted to, uh, pokey pokey in the butt.  Yeah.  Pokey pokey in the butt. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Gaze, gaze, gaze on.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  I mean.  Pokey pokey in the butt.  Licky, licky, licky, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick.  Yeah, licky, licky, yeah, it's fun.  Licky, licky, yeah, it's fun.  Pokey, pokey, yeah, it's a butt.  Not really.  Stupid Dave on a douche.  Yeah.  I can't wait to destroy that station when we get back to Boston.  Yeah.  Jack off.  Anyway, are the Little Kings ready to rock? 
[00:32:00]  They are ready.  All right, should we talk to them a little bit?  Let's get them in here, man.  Yeah, I'll bring them in real quick.  Are we getting pictures for the website?  Yeah.  We should put the pictures up immediately so people can play along at home.  We can look at their pictures and listen along.  You got a phone book?  Here they come.  Wow.  Guys, get over here.  Must be the drummer.  How do you know he's the drummer?  Because he's got drumsticks.  Oh, I didn't see the drumsticks.  Yeah, I know.  I didn't see the drumsticks.  The drumsticks.  What's up, guys? 
[00:32:30]  What's up, man?  Got a couple of years to share, Mike.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  He's the lead singer.  I'm the crazy one.  You're the singer?  Yeah, you know.  I can tell by his personality.  Yeah.  He's going right away.  Gets up on the mic.  That's right, dude.  Just give me a seat and a mic and I'm there.  So you guys are called the Little Kings.  You're from Jersey, right?  Yeah, that's where we're based out of.  Right.  We actually individually, three of us live in D.C.  and the other guitar player, Pauly, lives in Connecticut.  D.C.  Who's the guitar player and bass player over there?  Bass player.  Bass player.  Bass over there.  Hello, can you go?  Pauly is the guitar player with the hat and Carlton's the drummer. 
[00:33:00]  Could have figured that out.  Usually we call them.  How did this all come about?  I mean, are we allowed to say you're dwarves?  Yeah, that's cool.  Allowed.  Well, no, because we had a band called the Kiss Dwarfs.  And they got manned when we called them dwarves.  Really?  No.  Yeah, man.  Dwarfs are fine.  Yeah, dwarfs are cool.  I'll tell you what we don't like.  We don't like the term midget.  Oh, midget.  Yeah.  If you say little person or a little person or a little person or a little person or dwarf, 
[00:33:30]  that's cool by us, man.  Actually, we really like that.  I wouldn't want to piss them off if you'd fight.  You know, they'd punch you right in the sack.  There's no rules, man.  There's no rules.  Right in the sack.  Sack high, man.  Right there.  You're done.  So how tall are all you guys?  3'11".  3'11".  4'2".  I am the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of little people.  I am just about 4'7".  Wow.  Look at you, man.  With the height.  I'm face to boobs all the time.  That's what I'm digging.  How did you get together?  We've been friends for a while. 
[00:34:00]  We were walking down the street and all of a sudden...  This is weird, man.  We just bumped into each other.  All right.  Stop.  How the hell did you hook up?  Because there's no way...  Because Anthony was in bands all his life.  Really?  And it's not easy to get a band together.  And it's not easy to find other dwarves to form a band.  So how did it come about?  We've actually been friends for a long time through this thing called LPA, which is Little  People of America.  That's what I figured.  It had to be because I didn't usually...  When I was in school, maybe there was one dwarf.  Yeah, I used to hang out there. 
[00:34:30]  I would be like the big guy.  Right on.  You're the lone toppers.  There was usually only one dwarf in any school I ever went to.  Yeah.  So to get four guys together, and you said you hung out, I'm sure it was through an organization.  Absolutely, yeah.  But we actually, since we lived by each other, we've been good friends.  And then...  Are we hot dwarf chicks at that organization?  Yeah, there's some hot dwarf chicks.  Yeah?  Yeah, there's some hot dwarf chicks.  What do you like?  Hold on.  Hold on.  I've got to get into that.  He's laughing. 
[00:35:00]  Because he gets the hot dwarf chicks, that's why.  But would you guys rather have a normal...  I should say...  Average.  Average.  Okay, I know.  I'm sorry.  The normal word.  Hey, it all works, man.  All right.  An average-sized woman, or you find some of these dwarf ladies really hot?  I look at it this way.  If they have two legs, then they can open.  There you go.  Got to give them that.  It don't matter how tall or small you are, you know?  All right.  Been with all kinds of girls, though?  There you go.  Absolutely.  I think we'll have to pass on Bridget, though.  Yeah, well, I think I'll have to pass on that.  See, dwarves got the best of both worlds, Opie, because they could go out with average-sized 
[00:35:30]  women.  Yep.  And dwarf chicks.  We're like fantasies to most average-sized women.  But, like, if I was walking around with a dwarf chick, people would go, oh, you're just  doing that to bang a dwarf chick.  Right.  Right.  It would come across a little different.  That's right.  Although, you know, that's...  It's our world, dude.  We're just living in it, you know?  I think it'd be fun just kind of flipping her around a little bit.  That's kind of cool.  That's all right.  Does the black guy have the biggest penis in the band?  I don't know, man.  Go ahead, dude.  He wins, dude. 
[00:36:00]  He wins, man.  Lay it up.  Go ahead.  Lay it up on the table, dude.  Show him.  Lay it up on the table.  He's only got one leg.  Get down, dude.  It's coming out.  Hey, man.  He'll show you his if you show him yours.  When he gets excited, he becomes the tallest guy in the band.  I just know from talk, from other girls telling me, and I would have to say, yeah,  he is probably the biggest one in the band.  Wow.  You guys have, like...  The lady's telling us, man.  Do you guys have, like, normal junk?  No, what's up, man?  Yeah, absolutely we do.  We do.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  Or are you just saying that?  Thank Jesus Christ for that.  My God.  No, actually, no.  We do all right in that department.  You've seen some of the dwarf pornos and stuff.  I've never seen a dwarf guy in a porno.  You've never seen dwarf guy porno?  We've seen it in the back office.  No.  The guy's just railing this one.  I've seen the dwarf girl getting, you know...  That's hot.  Having sex with a normal-sized black guy.  Yeah.  That's hot.  Hello.  No, there's, like, a couple dwarf dudes.  Yeah.  Dwarf porno dudes.  Dwarf chicks.  Dwarf porno chicks.  Always firm, firm cans. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Always.  We respect that.  Yeah, it's nice.  So what kind of music do you guys play?  We play pretty much hard rock.  Yeah.  But that you can understand, you know, the words.  So it's not like hard rock where you don't understand what's going on.  It's actually, you can understand, but it's pretty groovy hard rock.  You guys must turn heads, though, walking down the street.  Yeah.  I mean, four years at once.  It's kind of like, wow.  It's pretty cool.  There's got to be something going on.  But now it's cool, though, because now that we're a rock band, we think that people are  looking at us because we're a rock band.  So we kind of just, you know, think that anyway. 
[00:37:30]  So we're like, yeah, yeah, it's us, you know.  No, there's four dwarfs walking down the street.  We don't have four dwarfs, man.  That's a lot of people in my bubble, dude.  Don't have a bust of a little.  That's a lot of people in my bubble, dude.  Before then, it used to be like, oh, they're staring at me because I'm dwarfs, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hear you.  Go down there, mister.  I hear you.  All right.  You guys.  I'm waiting to hear you rock, definitely.  I just have a CD coming out on the mini-discs.  Goddamn Norton.  Can't even commit the jokes out.  I got your mini-discs.  Let's take them.  Take them now.  Go down.  Norton can't even get the jokes out. 
[00:38:00]  Mini-discs.  Maybe you should read your lines a little bit better.  I like these guys.  All right, man.  Our CD actually, we're actually, funny you should say that, Norton, because you are such  a funny guy.  Our CD, we were talking about having the mini-disc being put in the average-sized case or whatever,  but I don't think we're going to go for it anyways, because what the hell.  We're different in our own right.  We don't have to have everything different about us.  All right.  Hey, we got something going on outside the studio today.  Outside, outside. 
[00:38:30]  We got the freak box set up, and we're going to have a lot of listeners down there.  So after you guys play, you got to go downstairs and say hi to our listeners.  What's a freak box, man?  It's this box where you just go in and do whatever the hell you want.  Really?  Yeah, like girls go in there and just have some kind of sex.  And they show their freak box?  And they can, yeah.  Sometimes.  Really?  Sure.  If you want to confess a murder or anything, people just go in, and there's a camera in  there, and they can do whatever the hell they damn well please in front of a camera.  I'd love to get some of you guys in there with some average-sized women.  That's cool.  Some of us.  All of us.  All of us. 
[00:39:00]  All right, cool.  Mountain climb them.  The freak box is set up outside Hooters, 56 between Broadway and 7th.  A bunch of us are going to be out there very, very soon.  Did you ask this question?  This is true, man.  Do you ever meet girls?  I know a chick, and she has a fetish.  She loves dwarf guys.  Yeah.  When she was young, she used to hang with a dwarf guy who would whack his bag on the side  of the house when they were kids.  Are you serious?  Yeah, I swear to God.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  That's an awful big bag, dude.  Well, you're standing outside of the house, and she says she always liked dwarves. 
[00:39:30]  I know where you're getting it.  Actually, as I said earlier, sometimes we are fantasies to most average-sized women because  fantasy is something that you usually can't have, and that's what we're all about because  there's not many of us in the world.  So when someone sees someone like that, they're always wondering how we are in bed and stuff  like this.  So if you're wondering how we are in bed, you come up.  You talk to me.  I'll show you.  It's 8 o'clock.  CBGB's.  Yeah, we're playing CBGB's at 8 o'clock.  So if you guys come down there and check it out.  Tonight you're playing CBGB's?  Yeah, 8 o'clock, man. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, cool.  And then we go on to New Brunswick right after that and play a gig in New Brunswick.  You got day jobs or something?  Or are you just in the band?  Not that we were proud to admit.  Yeah.  We're kind of making that transition right now from 9 to 5 to full-time rock bands.  That's cool.  I also wanted to plug real quick before we go is we're in a movie September 28th with  Ben Stiller.  It's called Zoolander.  And it is funny as freaking hell.  I'm telling you, it is so, so funny.  And the whole band is in it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's called Zoolander and it comes out September 28th. 
[00:40:30]  So that's a good time.  So make sure you guys check that out.  They're in a movie, Norton.  Yeah, what have you done, Norton?  We're getting throw downs now.  I don't know how many of my ass kicked at the end of this interview.  I'm just kidding, Norton.  I dig it, man.  No, it's all right.  No, you guys were good in The Wizard of Oz.  Oh!  You bastard.  We're going out.  You better be wearing a cup, dude.  That's cool, man.  Well, let's go rock, dude. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, let's see what they sell.  Oh, yeah.  What we're going to do is take a quick break.  When we get back, the little kings are going to rock.  Peace!  Some days, you know, we're a laugh riot.  And other days, we just flat out suck.  We know it.  Interesting and true.  Opie and Anthony.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW. 
[00:41:30]  New York.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Call free 877-692-1027.  Busy, busy day today.  Got the freak box outside.  Right outside Hooters.  56 between Broadway and Sevens.  We're going to head down there in a little while.  We're going to bring the little kings down there.  They're the world's shortest rock and roll band, Anthony.  Absolutely.  And they can play.  Little guys.  Yeah, they'll knock your socks off and then sleep in them. 
[00:42:00]  They're the little kings and they're playing CBGBs tonight at 8 o'clock.  We're going to go outside the studio and listen to them jam.  Yes, Jim Norton.  Court Tavern at 11, too.  I forgot the lead singer was telling me.  There are CBGBs at 8 and the Court Tavern in New Brunswick tonight at 11.  And they do kick ass.  So if you want to go down and check them out, you've got two chances.  Two shows, one night.  All right.  Norton Jr. on Instant Feedback.  He's taking cue from Norton.  He says,  I have them play standing on each other's shoulders with the long trench coat on, like from the Looney Tunes. 
[00:42:30]  I want to see them attack Big Kevin, tie him down like in Gulliver's Travel Style.  They're laughing.  They can hear us.  They're great guys.  They're cool.  They're going to give me such a savage baiting afterwards.  Big Kevin's like the Marlon Brando of dwarfs.  We'll just worship him.  He's Mephesto.  What, Rick?  He's Mephesto from South Park.  Yeah, there's a job for Big Kev. 
[00:43:00]  He could be the king of dwarfs living in his hovel.  Holy Jesus Christ, man.  Just nervously fixing his shirt and snorting a stack or two off of somebody's genitals.  All right, we should get out there, huh?  Sure.  Did you guys take a picture of Big Kev with the dwarfs around him?  Not yet.  That would be hilarious.  Uh-oh.  He's got a stapler.  Big Kev, how much do you weigh? 
[00:43:30]  About four dwarfs.  How much, really?  I don't know.  All right.  I'm going to guess the Little Kings plus Kiss and the Stones.  Holy Jesus Christ.  All right, we should get out there and listen to these guys.  Yeah, let's check it out.  Let me hear this.  We're going to take a bunch of pictures, video, and put it up on the website so everybody can  enjoy it.  And then after their appearance, they're going to go downstairs for a little while outside  Hooters for the Freak Box. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  56 between Broadway and 7th.  All right?  All right.  Let's get out there.  Move to our remote microphones, Opie.  Where the hell are they?  What the hell's it?  I'm yelling because I don't have a mic.  I'm not poor, you quick.  Here's our microphones.  All right, cool.  We're outside the studio.  These guys look like they're ready to rock, man.  There we go.  What song are we going to listen to today?  We're going to start off with a song called Bitter.  Bitter. 
[00:44:30]  Bitter?  Any of these songs have anything to do with being a dwarf?  Bitter.  Bitter.  Bitter.  They are going to blow the roof off this place.  I like how you never let your stacks be taller than you.  That's a good thing.  All right.  Here they are.  The Little Kings.  Bitter.  Bitter.  What did you see some light? 
[00:45:00]  If you are, then you are.  You say I'm out of line. 
[00:45:30]  Well, you are.  Yes, you are.  Why can't I go this time?  Don't go.  Don't go.  Feel it's overwhelming again.  Bitter.  Bitter.  What shall we see is taking over me?  Did I look at the way that I thought of me?  Did I look overstep and he found a reason? 
[00:46:00]  Can't you see the bitter in me?  Well, if things could go my way?  Well, no, no, you don't, yeah.  Well, can I eat that off your brain?  No, you won't.  No, you won't, yeah.  Well, how much was that kid if you gave me?  Don't go. 
[00:46:30]  Don't go.  Feel it's overwhelming again.  Bitter.  What shall we see is taking over me?  Did I look at the way that I want to be?  Did I look overstep and he found a reason?  Can't you see the bitter with me? 
[00:47:00]  Well, here we go, here we go.  Killing what I am, what I be, what I see.  He started his whole thing.  It's all about me.  For real?  Nah.  He's just a clone of what I see on the movie screen.  Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.  Hey, what's your name?  Don't be broke in your game.  Big of love like a thug I see through you.

Dude  Dwarfs and lesbians  He's been doing that for 15 years  Dude  So you can't have dwarves on your radio show? 
[00:56:30]  Are you insane?  Dude  You can  I'm not even going to freaking argue with the guy  You have humans on  He's had humans on for years  Oh my god  And don't be stupid  Holy smoke  Don't be stupid to think that Howard was the first one that had lesbians on his radio show  You idiot  I'm looking at video from the freak box  Holy Jesus  Look at this  Oh I know  I know that's what's going on outside 
[00:57:00]  People have  Outside the station today  It's like some guy  We have the freak box outside today Anthony  Go ahead  Explain it  He's with his chick  Her shirt is off  And he's  They're having some type of sexual encounter  Right inside the freak box  Looks all padded in there  What's he doing now?  Is that on the floor?  Is that free video?  Yeah  Holy smoke 
[00:57:30]  Her pants are coming off  Yeah it's free  It's free  So they can go to alltrue.com and check out what Anthony's checking out  Holy Jesus  And they're going to be at our road show at the Stone Pony a week from Saturday  The freak box  We're going to get some great great footage  Want to bring those guys in?  Wow  John and Dewey  Yeah  Oh those are the guys that are running the freak box?  Yeah  Okay sure  I'm just going to watch  What the hell is that?  Oh my god he's got his hand  Anthony  Yeah  Here are the guys that are responsible for the freak box 
[00:58:00]  I'm just looking at this  I've never seen that before in my life  I'm just looking at this clip  This is something  This is Dewey and John  They got in trouble a couple weeks back  Because they had the freak box in one of the clubs here in New York  And the media went absolutely nuts  Yeah  Right?  Yeah  You want to tell the story again?  Because we are on in a bunch of other markets  Dewey you want to do the honors?  Now we were over at a club down on the Lower East Side  Brought the freak box  Co-sponsoring a party with a feminist organization  Who was promoting female sexuality  Yeah 
[00:58:30]  And we were all for that  And after a while  A couple of porn stars somehow found their way into the freak box  Oops  Yeah  It was a problem  They did what porn stars do  And the thing that capped it all off  Is that everything was being broadcast via closed circuit TV to the club goers  Oh really?  Nice  Lots of cheering going on  Yeah  Crowd pleaser  It was a crowd pleaser  Who would want to see that though?  If you're hanging out  800 people in spa  They didn't want to see it?  No they did  Yeah that's what I mean 
[00:59:00]  Everyone wants to see that  So what was the problem?  Giuliani  Rudy  Oh you guys have a problem with him too?  I'm not getting any at home  The fine mayor of New York?  Yeah  Rudy was unhappy  What a tool he is man  So the couple was having sex in the freak box  They were broadcasting it to the whole club  The place is just going nuts  And then the media picked up on it  It was a huge front page story here in New York  Yeah you have to cover the post  Close it down  Yeah  He disgusts me  We got the freak box outside  Outside Hooters 
[00:59:30]  56 between Broadway and 7th  And we're hoping to get some wild stuff going on today right?  Yeah  It's going to happen  I love the freak box  I love the idea  But I love the fact that you guys look like Henry Lee Lucas and Otis Toll  I don't know how happy you guys make me  Okay  Should I be complimenting?  I'm totally lost at this point  Portrait of the serial killer  I got it  Yeah he has some obscure references  Don't mind him  That's Jim Norton over there  Oh you're the famous Norton  Ah yes  I could just sit here and watch these clips all day 
[01:00:00]  And I think I'm going to  Oh you got one?  That's our man Nat  Helping you out there  Good  Going to find a good one for me to watch here I guess  That last one was really good  It was some guy and his chick  And he took her clothes off  And they were doing things in the box  It's about self-expression  Self-expression?  That's what you guys are going with?  It takes on all forms though  Yeah  I love that  It's really about our constitutional rights to see people  I mean  Some people have nothing to say 
[01:00:30]  Yeah  The bummer about it is that we can't really use the footage that we get from something like  Spa on the website  No?  No  We got to keep it R-rated or less man  Oh is that it?  That's our mantra  So the good footage or the footage that took place at Spa just sits in a vault  It does  No it's in your personal collection  It's at my house  Oh you can't  Yeah you watch it at home  So where do you guys go with the freak box?  All over the country or just in the New York area?  We've been up and down the east coast  Done like 30 college campuses 
[01:01:00]  Big college towns  We've done a bunch of clubs in New York  Oh man they've got some good stuff  Yeah there's amazing stuff  Lots of Ivy League  Nubile young co-eds  It's amazing  You can watch this is a Pruder film  But you can't watch this  You can watch Kennedy's head coming off  But you know to see two junked out ecstasy people having sex is illegal  What the hell is this?  That is shocking  I'm watching a guy is shooting  Steve-O from Jackass  Oh that's Steve-O?  Yeah  From Jackass shooting a bottle rocket out of his 
[01:01:30]  That's self-expression  Self-expression  Out of his back door?  He had to pull his pants  Oh he got set on fire  Yeah  We started working on Steve-O  Wait wait man  What's going on?  Because it's a video of Steve-O doing what?  He pulled his pants down  Right  Lit a bottle rocket  And launched it from his own bottle  No way  To whatever you want to call it  So Steve-O is one of the featured performers on the cast of characters that makes up All True  Freak Box is one aspect of All True  And the rest of the stuff is stunts, pranks, sketch comedy on the street 
[01:02:00]  You know reality comedy  And it's AllTrue.com  And the Freak Box is like a reality machine  Yeah  It drives itself  People go in there, do amazing stuff  And we get it on the site  Things they normally wouldn't do  And then all of a sudden you're in this box  Yeah, you're all alone  Freedom  Freedom  Freedom of expression  Totally amazing what people do when the cameras start rolling  It's going to be great when they're at our road show  We're looking forward to that  You guys are going to get some great stuff  And then you'll put it on the website for everyone to see?  Absolutely 
[01:02:30]  Absolutely  Did you see it yet?  Oh  Holy yes  Oh  Yeah  And then some of the hair is like lit on fire  We did that same trick with the bottle rocket with a girl  Almost a year ago today  Yeah, she, for 4th of July  She came in and we set up a little blast shield for her though  And the stick actually was right there  No way  And it launched out  Wow, nice  Yeah, I think Steve-O  Right down the hall  We saw the memorial plaque as we came in  Memorial plaque 
[01:03:00]  Wow, a lot of Steve-O stuff on here  Cool  Yeah, Steve-O's been a good friend to us for a couple of years now  He's twisted, huh?  Oh my God, the guy is so twisted  Anthony, we got the clip of the girl doing it  Oh, we do?  Yes  Check this out  4th of July moment  This baby is  The ring is clear  Psycho Mark is downrange  All right, Psycho Mark is downrange  He is hiding behind El Duque  The big giant life-size cardboard cutout of El Duque  We're firing a bottle rocket and a black eye 
[01:03:30]  Isn't that a...  Hey, stop it  Uh, Opie  Here you go, hit  If you would please give me the lighter  Okay  Yes, clear the range  Clear the range  What a great moment in radio this is  And fire in the hole  Let's go  Fire in the hole  And that's never been more appropriate  Than it is right now  Ready?

Yeah, yeah  How you sounded  Oh, no, get out of the way  Oh, bottle rocket just shot out  Oh, I can't go on  Oh, no  My voice went up like 10 octaves  Because it was just one of the most unbelievable things I've ever seen in my life  The greatest  Just shot out  Woo!  Seven astronauts killed in that  That would have been better  James, what's going on? 
[01:06:00]  Oh, an astronaut  What's up?  Hey, man  Real quick  How big are the instruments that those little dwarfs are playing?  Are they normal-sized instruments?  No, they're a little  They're a little  They were smaller  Does the guy use toothpicks as drumsticks?  No, they were smaller  He said he got some kind of endorsement deal  And their company's going to make them up a bunch of guitars and stuff  Mattel  Mattel  One other thing, too  Do me a favor  You've got to get Mendy off of the website  She's killing me  Her legs look like she's got hail damage  It's brutal 
[01:06:30]  I can't look at it  Well, just don't look at her pictures, you know?  Get her and Norton in the freak box  All right  You wouldn't fit in the freak box  We're hoping some more moms come down for the Moms I'd Like to F Contest  Oh, yeah  That's still going on until next week  Yeah, we're extending the qualifying Monday and Tuesday of next week  He can come down as well  A chance to win a trip to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina  Right  A lot of instant feedback coming in about the Little Kings, Anthony  Yeah  Jay from Nutley

[01:07:30]  Jay Moore Jr. writes  Make sure there are no shopping bags in the bathroom stall  That old gag  Let's go to Bluto  Bluto, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man  If you guys go to Cleveland  I think you're going to have to rename the Cleveland Steamer  My suggestion, of course, is the Norton Steamer  After last week's stunt  When he ate that brown ice cube  No, it was good, though  It was clear and lovely  No, that was disgusting last week  I can't believe you did that  All right, Bluto  Do it again in a second 
[01:08:00]  Girl shoves an ice cube in the balloon knot  And that was the first one in  The other one popped out  And that was the one that was in really deep  I'm a trooper for the show  And then Norton popped it right in his mouth  It was instinct  We are looking for a girl  That would want to do a Cleveland Steamer  For our first day in Cleveland  That would be nice, wouldn't it?  Imagine first day on in Cleveland  We commemorate and honor the city  By having a girl give a guy a Cleveland Steamer  Well, who's going to receive the oldest steam robber?  Well, we're open to it being the glass table Cleveland Steamer 
[01:08:30]  Where the girl gets over the glass table  We'll put some guy, Norton, under the table  And she could do it on the glass table  So we just need a girl who's filthy whore enough to do such a stunt  And who will eat the proper foods, by the way  You know, you have to be careful  You eat the right things before you do that  Yeah, it's got to work  Right  That could happen next week  As we welcome Cleveland, Columbus, and Sacramento  To this mess called the O.P. Anthony Show 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, this isn't something, though  That we're looking for girls like for the mom contest  It's an easy thing  We know this girl is going to have to be like the scourge of society  A real hose monster, disgusting pig  To come up here and do this  Is Mendy's number?  With solid BMs  You want solid?  It has to be for a steamer  It has to be, it has to be tapered and nice  Otherwise it's disgusting  Jeez  All right  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[01:09:30]  How you doing?  Good  The bottle rocket, that was great  That was like, I just started listening to you guys at that point  That was a great moment in radio, I gotta say  But I think even better was when you guys were back in Boston  And the woman called in  And went at herself  Went at, oh my god  Oh yeah  The big O  Yeah, there's an unedited version of that somewhere on the internet  That was absolutely crazy  When the girl called just out of nowhere and was watching a porno 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, she was watching her teacher or something like that  Yeah, yeah  The coach  We can't even play that anymore  That was absolutely hilarious  Oh, cool, man  Your voice is like skyrocketed  All right  All right, you guys suck  Thanks, Chris  Later  All right, bye  Brother Joe wants to check in here  Brother Joe, what's up?  Hey, fellas  Hey, man  I have a suggestion  If you do get a girl to come down and do the steamer on Norton  Yeah  You should have a Norton cam  Oh, yeah  The underside cam to get on a website  Yeah, yeah 
[01:10:30]  Norton cam  I think there should be the Norton cam  No one is doing a steamer on Norton  It's not happening  What about under the glass table?  Oh, yeah  That will at least, you know  Help my parents face their friends  We raised him right  He laid under the table, didn't he?  That would be the line for you?  Yeah, no logs  I'm sorry  No logs  Nothing solid  You're into the golden shower, though  Who isn't?  But the whole  But under a glass table  Nothing even touches you  I don't care if it's under a glacier  Solid waste  I want 
[01:11:00]  No, if I step in it  I throw the sneaker out  It's icky  It's icky  All right, man  It's from the man that's four knuckles deep  Eating an ice cube  I know  Thank you, Joe  I'll see you guys later  Okay  Let's go to Mike  Mike, what's going on?

[01:36:00]  Right  And then they saw it  And they gave it like 20 years off the bat?  Yeah  Yeah, man  And the gringos like to go out there  And, oh, we're going to save the world  With the Peace Corps and all that  And then they go to these foreign countries  They get put in these jails for crimes  They didn't even know they would come in  What'd she do with the girl in Peru?  Yeah, what'd she do, Old Dirty?  Yeah, she was  They kind of say she was down with this  Like this militant movement  That wanted to overthrow the government  You know what I'm saying?  Mm-hmm  But like five years ago  She was shouting like  Oh, she was all like  You know, she was back then militant  When they arrested her  Right  And like five years after the fact 
[01:36:30]  You know, with her parents  Flying back and forth  Do they call it central booking  Down in the far countries?  Oh, you know  I'm pretty sure they got another name for it  But that's the one you're most familiar with  Oh, yeah, no doubt  Central booking  You know, my friend got busted for coke in Barbados  And they said that they had to pay a judge off  And when he took a dump  They didn't have papers  So he had to wipe with his suit jacket  Thanks for sharing it  I just felt like that  I knew this  I'd never have another chance to tell that story  What a humorous little anecdote  Yes  Perfect for parties

I'm getting some information  I'm getting some street side of this whole thing  Sure  No doubt  Here we go with the next start  I say keep the Central Park alligator  But he was a caiman or something like that  It keeps the muggers and the muggies out the area  All right, you got to explain the alligator  Yeah, yo, there was an alligator  Somewhere up there by uptown  Like 110th Street, right?  Yeah, a little lake  Yeah, a little two-foot alligator 
[01:37:30]  Caught this guy from Florida  Me a whole big deal on it  They brought in a guy from Australia  To get the alligator  I swear, when they showed this thing on TV  I was laughing  I've had lizards bigger than this  When I was living in California  I'd catch lizards  Put them in a terrarium  And they were bigger than this goddamn alligator  That everybody was freaking out about  For you and I  But for the little kings  That's a threat  That's true  It would take a whole lot  Alligator was no more than two feet, though  And you think we should keep the alligator in the lake there  And keep the late-night crime down

Well, he had a little bit of fame before that  I mean, I remember watching him on Hogan's Hero 
[01:52:00]  You know, he was number one in L.A. on the radio  For ten years straight  Yeah, I read that  Yeah  Definitely on the website  He was called the king of the L.A. Airways  From 1957 to 1965  Ripping me off  What did he do on his radio show?  He kind of invented the morning format  He like had  That's right, Robin  So he invented radio  Bob Crane ripped me off, Robin  But he was before you  No, no  Maybe Bob Crane went into a time machine 
[01:52:30]  You know, I was going to have my head beat in with a tripod, Robin  And he stole that from me  Let's go to Nobu  Get a Seabreeze  The king of L.A. radio  Yeah, he was called the king of the L.A. Airways  And he invented morning radio  No, he invented  The morning zoo  Basically, yeah  He would have like a chimpanzee  And so  Like everyday playing drums  And he invented  Insert your own joke  I'm not even going there  What's the joke?  Do your own joke at home  Figure it out  Yeah  Alright, so 
[01:53:00]  You know what he invented  Was sampling on radio  Nobody  Really?  No one before him  Would like fly in sound effects  And crazy like little samples  Of people talking before him  Because they didn't have digital samplers  Right, right  He would like edit tape together  And do that  Look at that  That's right  We have Bob Crane to blame  For all the morning zoos  For everything we do  He should have been bludgeoned  Oh, come on  Jesus Christ  Come on  What, I thought we were having fun  Oh, man  Look  Don't make me go fight club on you 
[01:53:30]  Because I will  This guy knows a lot about our show  I will go fight  Yeah, I'm a big fan  Cool  Maybe not anymore, though  Now, Opie can't say that  But you can  You are a sick bastard, man  I've been trolling through the website  Trolling  Reading  Well, trolling  You just hit your cough button  Trolling through the website  Bobcrane.com  And you would think  That being someone's son  You wouldn't  I don't know  Publish stuff like this  And you've gotten a lot of flack 
[01:54:00]  I really haven't  Actually  I really haven't  To be honest with you  I think it's hysterical  I love it  And the sicker the better  And that is twisted  You've gotten some flack from it  Hell yeah  Not much  Not much  Are you kidding?  Who?  I've seen stuff in the news  I've seen the  The sister there  Is getting all upset  And the half-brother guy  What half-brother?  I don't know  I read it on  What was this?  What half-brother?  You know what?  There's a guy running around the country  Calling himself Bob Crane Jr.  Oh, here we go 
[01:54:30]  Here we go  That's my wife Michelle, by the way  Yeah, she's very, very good looking  Karen Crane, I guess  Or Karen  What's her name?  She owns that  Yeah, that's my sister  Looks just like my dad  And Robert David Crane  The son by the actor's first wife  He calls himself Bob Crane Jr.  But my dad was Robert Edward Crane  There is no Bob Crane Jr.  He writes these articles as Bob Crane Jr.  And he's been  I guess he's  From what I've heard  Telling reporters at the Arizona Republic  And the New York Post  That I'm not Bob Crane's son  Oh, really?  Yeah  Can you prove it? 
[01:55:00]  Pull out your schlong  Because Bob Crane had quite the ample one  From the video clips I saw  He had a large mule  It looked like the bass player  From the Little Kings  Oh, a dwarf fan we just had up here  Hey, callbacks  I love callbacks  So when did you decide  To finally put this in a book  And on a website?  Just to get back to that one  I'm willing to do a DNA test  Any day of the week  No, I don't doubt you at all  You can kind of see it in his eyes  I can see it  You can see it in my pants  You can see it in my pants 
[01:55:30]  Uh-oh, really?  He's packing?  Nice  I can  Packing heat  Jim, you want to check out his mule?  I do respect it, though  He respects my mule  Absolutely  Does the top of it look like Schultz's helmet?  You know, those German helmets  Always look kind of like the helmet  Gotta admit  Scotty, how old are you?  I'm 30  So, you didn't know your dad that?  Yeah, I was seven when he died  I mean, he taught me how to do radio  He used to set me up with a turntable 
[01:56:00]  And a four-track recorder  And a microphone  And some Kiss records  And he'd be like  Take it to the post, Scotty  Take it to the post  In the meantime  Like in the background  He'd be editing porno  You know what I mean?  He'd be like  Hey, Scotty, you go take it to the post  I'm gonna go edit some chick banging me in Austin  He was really into the post  He was really into his porno  He was into his music  He was into his drumming  He was into his, you know, DJing  He was into acting  He was into porno  Wow  Yeah, I gotta say  Did you guys just find a box of his pornos in the attic?  We didn't have to find him  They were laying around the house  Yeah, from what I hear  He just used to show you kids and everything  And everybody else 
[01:56:30]  You know, Archie Bunker was our neighbor  And like Archie Bunker  Just passed away  But he would like come over to the house  How big was his mule?  I don't know  I don't know  With the books coming out soon  Keep your eyes open  No, Carol Connor would come over to the house  And like my dad would be like  Hey, have some dinner with us  And later I'll take you down to the basement  And show you some of my homemade sex tapes  He was just totally open with it  There's this report  No, why?  Because his mule was so big  Yeah, yeah  He's got nothing to be embarrassed about  Who wouldn't be?  Yeah, right, right  Look at me go  If he was some Pee Wee Herman  He wouldn't be showing it off everywhere  Yeah  Now, you know what? 
[01:57:00]  He was totally on the cutting edge of technology  And if he was around today  He'd have a website called bobcrain.com  Oh, yeah, the video thing  I mean, he was doing it  When it was really hard to film yourself  Well, he was doing it in the 40s  Yeah  I mean, he was making films  Of amateur sex films in the 1940s  And that's the one thing  Like, Karen and this quote-unquote  Bob Crane Jr.  Run around saying that  He started this in the 70s  When he met my mother  It's totally untrue  On the website right now  Bobcrain.com  We have films of him from 1956  Having, you know 
[01:57:30]  Explicit sex with women  Black and white mule pictures  And Michelle, my wife, has seen these films  I mean, what do you think of these films?  I think they're pretty sexy  Yeah, fine, they're sexy  They're like, I'm not really into porn  That much  I mean, I've seen some porn  It's kind of sexy for a minute  But then it's just like, whatever  But these are kind of cool  Because they're just like  Time capsule from the 50s  And the women are just total bombshells  You know, women don't come like that anymore  Well, they certainly don't  They got huge muffs, though  They got the big 70s and 50s  Earth mama muffs  Oof 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, no shaving  No shaving was going on back then  No fake boobs, either  No, that was all real  There's a real deal  So your mom doesn't mind that  His mom was my step  My mother-in-law  Oh, we just got married  Okay, my mother-in-law was Hilda  On Hogan's Heroes  That's right  Yeah  Colonel Klink's very sexy secretary  Yeah  There's always something going on  Between her and Hogan  She's not pissed at you  That these pornos are out there  For everyone to check out?  No, the reality is  We want to get the story straight  Because there's a lot of rumors out there  About Bob Crane that just aren't true  That Bob Crane was into S&M  Totally untrue  That Bob Crane photographed these women 
[01:58:30]  Without their knowledge  And that a lot of women have come out  Saying that  Trying to protect their own identity  And that makes Bob Crane kind of a dark guy  And the fact is  My father wasn't dark at all  He was really light  He was a funny guy  He was a total comedian  He was a performer in every aspect of his life  And these cameras are two inches away  From their faces  Yeah, no voyeur cams back then  What about the gay rumor?  Totally untrue  Totally untrue  Look at the book  Check it out  Never saw him with another man's hog anywhere  So, all right  There was group sex things  But he was always 
[01:59:00]  Now you're plugging a woman  You're handing Anthony a book  Yes  We went over the website  The faces of Bob Crane  Bobcrane.com  And now  Can you get this book somewhere?  Because I hear it's unbelievable  It is unbelievable  It was the first shot  Him taking a picture of himself  In a mirror  You know what his quote was?  I mean  He made quotes  He made quotes all the time  He said  I'm hip  I'm flip  And I'm cocky  He said  I don't drink  And I don't smoke  And two out of three ain't bad  You know  That was Bob Crane  Here's a picture of him in the mirror  With a  Bending a girl over a dresser  Or something  Here's the familiar picture 
[01:59:30]  We all know and love Bob Crane  As Colonel Hogan  A little publicity shot, right?  Oh yeah  And the family man  It goes through him  Is that  That's your mom  That's your mom  Yeah  Very beautiful woman  And is that you?  Yeah  As a little infant?  There it is  I could totally see  He's Bob Crane's son  Like there are a few times  You look around  It's like  Oh my god  Looks just like him  That's the funny thing  There's Bob Crane Jr.  You're a guy running around the country  Saying that  Basically that I'm not 
[02:00:00]  Bob Crane's son  Yeah  He's blonde  He's bald  He's blue eyed  And he's fat  Bob Crane has a lot of kids  And they all look like him  This guy  What an endorsement for Nikon  Is that his favorite camera?  Yeah  He was  Wow  That's Bob Crane  Oh my god  That's his  Is that Bob  Or was this the tripod  That was used in the crime  Because I gotta tell you  He's kind of was a tripod  He's packing  That's Bob's member  Wow  Look at the natural 
[02:00:30]  Screaming pink cheeses  Breasts on these lovely  Oh yes  There's Bob Crane  Getting the Hummer  Hey that was the apartment  That he was killed in  That was the apartment  That he was killed in  Right there's the couch  That he filmed women  He had sex with  Look at the  Look at the camera  Everywhere  They're everywhere  Is this video equipment?  That's video equipment  It's called  Real to real  Videotaped acts  Now where are those tapes?  It looked like  What I saw on the website  Were films  At my house  Oh at your house  Wow  What's your address?  Just kidding  Look at the 
[02:01:00]  Yeah the one where  He's taking a picture  Inside bending her over  That's great  He got a lot of girls  To do some lesbian action  On film  Keep turning the pages  Women were willing  To perform for him  At any time  And they were never  Coerced  And they were smiling  And happy to be on film  With Bob Crane  I'll tell you that much  There he is  Poolside  I guess  Broadcasting  That's the thing you know what  This is coming out  To set the record straight  My dad wasn't a dark character  My dad had a lot of fun  He enjoyed his celebrity  You know what I mean?  Yeah  Everyone in Hollywood  Knew about it too  And it's like it was 
[02:01:30]  The swingin' 60s  Swingin' 70s  I gotta interrupt you  Because I just saw a picture  There's Bob Crane  With the monkey  Doing his radio show  With the chimp  He's got a chimp  On the drums  That's what you  He would get bored  During interviews  He interviewed like  Marilyn Manson  Marilyn Manson  I do that every time  Marilyn Monroe  Ronald Reagan  And he'd get bored  During an interview  Just turn his back  On the person  He was interviewing  And start playing the drums  Can we go and get some  Some ass Bob  There you go  Put it on tape  I don't care  Bring Bonzo  Yeah 
[02:02:00]  You mind if we rip off  Your father's idea  And get a monkey  On this radio show  That's gonna become my idea  Is that gonna be your idea?  He was a  I have a drummer  Oh yeah  He was played for the  Connecticut Symphony Orchestra  When he was 14 years old  Another publicity shot  From Hogan's Heroes  Hey you know what  Bob Crane  There was this reporter  From the New Times L.A.  Called him up  Right after Super Dad Disney  After Hogan's  He started doing Disney movies  He was number one  Contract guy for Disney  Isn't that funny?  Yeah  And he's banging girls on tape 
[02:02:30]  Yes exactly  Here's the story  The reporter from the New Times  Calls him up and says  Hey I want to follow you around  See what it's like to be Bob Crane  And so he comes over to the house  My dad introduces him  To the whole family  Gives him some food  Takes him down to the basement  Shows him a bunch of  Homemade porno tapes  Takes him out to a strip club  Has him snap a bunch of pictures  Of him with these strippers  That you'll see in this book here  The faces of Bob Crane  Or you can see the pictures  At bobcrane.com  Come out in the paper  The next day  Of course what happens  Disney fires Bob Crane  The last thing he wanted to do  Was be fired  He had no idea  That this would be a problem  He didn't think  It would be a problem 
[02:03:00]  It didn't occur to him  He was so open about it  You know everyone in Hollywood  Was doing this  It's just that he was  The only person documenting it  He was so open about it  That the pictures  That you're looking at right now  Were in the same family  Photo album  Like here's my wife  And Scotty at Disneyland  Here we are on a ski trip  And here's a chick  That I banged in Austin  It was like all in the same book  It was just bizarre  We saw Bob Crane  Going south on a girl here  And quite the technique  1956  And he's  He invented that sideways thing  That like Ron Jeremy  And everybody  You know what I'm talking about  There's a picture of Bob  On Muff Mountain 
[02:03:30]  Oh my god  This guy's wow  Another Disney movie  Oh wait  Knuckles  Bob Crane in action  There's just people  There's one guy  Fully clothed  Watching  Bob  Do this from behind  And he's just got a drink  In his hand  Fully clothed  Were there a lot of these  Orgies and stuff  And who's this guy  With the 70's do  I don't know  He looks like  He looks like Ron Jeremy  Has any of these guys  Come forward and said  Hey I was on that tape  No  No  Was he banging any celebrities  Any starlets  You're going to have to wait 
[02:04:00]  Until the full book comes out  Oh  Oh  Oh look at that  A little TF action  That was the picture  That got him fired from Disney  No  No you're on it  You're on it  Oh  Right there  With the drums  With the drums  And the stripper  Oh this one  He's distracted  Yeah  I'm looking  Now I know  When it bends like that  It doesn't feel good  That's why I was looking  That's why I was looking  Ah  Look at this artistic shot  Of a silhouette  With a girl giving Bob a hummer  And the little light halo  Around it  Very artistic  It's mellow gold baby 
[02:04:30]  I like that  Ah  Why'd you  Ah  You're insane  There's a picture of Bob Crane  With his head caved in  Oh come on  I gotta see that  You know  You guys have pictures  Everywhere  That picture's been on CNN  E-Hollywood  Holy smoke  I gotta say one thing  That's your palm  Hey wait  I gotta say one thing  Yeah  This picture is a pictorial history  Of my father  It goes from the very first  Known photo of him  When he was a very small child  To the very last picture  Ever taken of him  Which is dead in the  Scottsdale hotel room  Wow  It traces his professional career  It traces his family life  And it traces his sex life  And the murder is still 
[02:05:00]  Completely unsolved  Yeah  And I have to say one thing  You know what I mean  To all the people who want to say  That I'm sick or whatever  This is the most moving tribute  I've ever done to Bob Crane  Since he's died  It shows that  It shows  It's called the faces of Bob Crane  Because it shows all the faces of Bob Crane  You know I guess  If he lived his life like this  And was very open about it  And showed people stuff  Then something like this  I guess wouldn't bother him  Who do you think killed your dad  I don't think it was the guy  Who was accused  That's for sure  I think the Scottsdale  In my opinion  The Scottsdale police  Yeah  Where does the mob go  When they leave New York and Chicago 
[02:05:30]  In Arizona  Yeah damn straight  Yeah  That's where like the relocation programs  Yeah  Yeah right  So you're thinking maybe some mob tie-in  You know what I think  I think they needed to  I think they needed to solve the case quick  And I think they needed to pin it on somebody  That wasn't guilty  And John Henry Carpenter  The guy that was accused  No friend of our family for sure  He was a creepy guy  But I think the Scottsdale police fingered him  And I think we might have video of that somewhere too  No no no  I really don't think he did it  I think that  It was suspicious  Do you have any ideas 
[02:06:00]  Of who might have done it  Let me put it this way  There's a really strong rumor  That's  It might even be substantiated at this point  There was this mob informant  Known  Well known mob informant  From the FBI  Who was in jail in Arkansas  When my dad was killed  He calls up the Scottsdale police  And he says  I know who killed Bob Crane  And it was a mob hit  And Scottsdale police  Extradited him from Arkansas  Put him in a Phoenix jail cell  And they're going to get his statement  The next morning  He hangs himself in the jail that night 
[02:06:30]  Bizarre  What kind of mob ties would your father have had  That the mob would want to play  He was probably banging the mob girlfriends or something  Here's the thing  You go into a small town  You're a real big celebrity  And back then Scottsdale was small  I mean really tiny  You're a big celebrity  You're going to strip clubs  Who owns the strip clubs?  Ah well  Yeah right  Who owns the porno houses?  Who distributes porno?  And you're hanging out with these people  And you're meeting their wives  You're meeting their daughters  You're meeting their girlfriends  Uh huh  So maybe you might take one back to your room

[02:14:00]  Off my dad's name  That's cool  No I was just wondering  That's cool  Because I love Hogan  And I just  Hey  I wish you the best of luck  Hey thanks man  I'm just trying to  Set the story straight  Hey syndication  When you come to  Showton Connecticut  All right  Chris what's going on  Yo I just wanted to know  Was your like mom  Watching these videos  Was she ever involved  In these videos  While he's banging  All these chicks  No she knew about it  I mean they knew each other  For five years  Before they got married  And everyone in Hollywood  Knew about it  He was very open with it  And she had no problem  With that  No man she said  When she married him 
[02:14:30]  That he didn't lose  His first amendment rights  Wow  Look at those marriages  So he was allowed  To continue banging  And filming it  Yeah the only thing  He wasn't allowed to do  Was show me  What a trooper  Was she ever involved  In any  No no  Jesus  Man  She had no problem  With it though  That's something  Yeah that's quite a woman  Now that's a woman  You marry  Bob was on to something  Wasn't he  Sure wow  They don't come like that  Anymore  That's a keeper  That's unbelievable  All right  No I was  In kindergarten 
[02:15:00]  And I was drawing  These pictures  Like the teacher  Pulled me aside  And she's like  What is going on  At home  Because all my pictures  Were women with like  Three breasts  And four penises  First girl I saw  On the street  I tried to undress  I swear to God  Really  I swear to God  Had some kind of  Effect on you  Oh yeah I guess so  How old were you  Like two years old  I like saw  A girl across the street  Named Susie  And I was like  Hey Susie meets Scotty  Tried to take off her clothes  That's great  Why couldn't you  Have been adopted  By Paula Poundstone  She'd have loved you 
[02:15:30]  Right  You think that's true  What the Paula Poundstone  Allegations  What up with that  There's some kind  Of lewd act  She had with a minor  Oh my god  Did somebody just say  He hopes it's true  God damn  Norton  Government should be  Out of our lives  Some got a right wing  Republican  Bob what's up  Hey how you doing  Pretty good  That guy Bob  Boy he had a really  Great life  Not only was he  A great guy  But his wife  Seems like she was too  I got two questions 
[02:16:00]  I want to ask  One was  Was he killed in a motel  Like you said  It was in a condominium  Well it was  Okay you got me there  It was an apartment building  But they also rented out  Hotel rooms by the night  Oh okay  But the theater  That he was working for  At the time  Rented out the room  Right okay  And my second question was  Was he friends  And did he run with Jack  Nicholson  No but you know what  God they looked  Just like each other  Actually when I was a kid  I used to see pictures  Of Jack Nicholson 
[02:16:30]  And thought it was my dad  Oh okay  Really  Yeah  Hey you take a good look  At Jack Young  And Bob Young  And me Young  I wonder if they both  Had like the same  Personality  You know  They seem like  Jack seems like  A wild guy  Ten inches of personality  Anyway  Take it easy  Good luck  Hi Bob  It's strange how  I guess everybody  In the industry  Like you said  Knew all this was going on  But I grew up  Watching Hogan's Heroes  And then when I was  In high school  I found out he was killed  And then all this came out 
[02:17:00]  And I was like  Holy smoke  How the hell  You know  He kept it secret though  From all the people  No he didn't  No he didn't  Hollywood kept it a secret  Yeah I guess Hollywood  Kept it a secret  He didn't at all  Like I said  He showed the New Times guy  Yeah but he wasn't like  He was going to everybody's house  In the country  And shown in these pictures  You knew him  Yes he was  He was  He'd show the mailman  The milkman  Anyone that came by  Hey buddy come on  And they were just laying around  It wasn't like  Come here  I want to show you something  What I'm doing is nothing  That he would be ashamed of  At all  He would be very proud of it 
[02:17:30]  I mean the fact is  I'm setting the record straight  The guy photographed these women  That wanted to be photographed  And he wasn't really doing anything  That weird  It's just because you know him  As the squeaky clean Hogan  It was just straight sex  And the lorgy thing going on  The only thing weird  Was he was documenting it  And with video cameras  Which were unavailable to the public  Thank God now  You get the palm quarter  Make your own at home  This is a great story  Patrick what's up  Hey hey  I just heard that  I was listening to the bit  You guys played 
[02:18:00]  And Scotty was saying that  I don't know  It sounded like  It sounded like  There was something going on  Between Bob Crane and Richard Dawson  No they were just on the TV show  The part about Richard Dawson  Is just parody  It's just a joke  But you know what I mean  We're an award winning radio show  I mean  Yeah Richard Dawson  He loved the women  Yeah  He kissed every woman  On Family Feud  I just wondered  Okay I just didn't know  If there was any competition  Between them or anything like that  No I always wondered  About Richard Dawson  If he'd rather be kissing  The boys on Family Feud 
[02:18:30]  He's a wondering question  So your father  Didn't have any of that  Gay sex then  No no  That was reported  For many years  Well a lot of people said  A lot of things were reported  You know what I mean  Going right to the source  They said that his body  Was found covered in semen  They said he was hung  They said you know  They were right about that  Well he was hung  But yeah right  Ba da ba  Sounds like Norton's  Last weekend  He could have been  In slap happy  Volume 12  With that music  The reality is 
[02:19:00]  I'm setting the record straight  Hey Earl  Yeah guys  What's up  What's up  Earl's outside the building  With the freak box  I want to get in the freak box  Do you  I want to sign some scrotums  Down there  Oh my god  Take it back  Hey Earl  You were great  On Bob Crane's radio show  Oh god  Earl what's going on  I heard that  I'm like  Duh  We're broadcasting this  We're out of the thing this summer  Really  Beat up here 
[02:19:30]  We got the Channel 9 news crew  Helping everyone  As you can hear  The trucks are rolling by  People go into the booth  And everyone that goes  Into the booth  Will get a pair of tickets  To see Run DMC  Courtesy of the WWF  And the world  And you guys should come on down here  Get on TV  Earl we're doing a radio show  You were a little busy right now  You said you were going to come down here  There's people waiting here for you  I'll come down there  Yeah we'll be down after the show I guess  In about a half hour or so  And Stephen Lynch  He said he was definitely going in the box 
[02:20:00]  He rode up on his bike  But Channel 9 showed up  Yeah Channel 9 is here filming right now  Okay yeah  We got the freak box outside Hooters  56 between Broadway and 7th Avenue  Nice  Get on TV today  Hold on Earl  The freak box  Freak  Yeah I'll get in there  Let's go to Ralphie  Ralphie what's up  Hey boys how's it going  Good  Scott I just wanted to let you know  I met your dad many years ago  When he was doing the theater circuit  The dinner theaters  What a great guy  Oh thank you  What a great guy  Did he show you pictures 
[02:20:30]  No he didn't  But we did some talking about it  Man let me tell you  He was a ladies man  Oh yeah yeah  He was smooth  He was great  He gave me a great autograph  And it was one of the  Thrills of my life  To meet him  I'm sorry he's gone  Yeah so am I  How many different women  Would you say  He had sex with  I'll tell you what man  I got thousands and thousands  Of pictures  And I've got hours  And hundreds and hundreds  Of hours of video  And they're different women  Oh yeah  Oh my god  Did he ever get any diseases  No no 
[02:21:00]  They didn't have this  Yeah they didn't have diseases  Back then  Why don't you sell the videotapes  Can you sell them  www.bobcrane.com  Wow  Nice  Nice  The weird thing you guys  Is when they found his body  They have crime footage  Of the crime scene  And there are stacks  And stacks  And stacks  Of videos  When the whole thing  Was wrapped up  They got like  You know  Ten videos back  But there were stacks  And stacks  Oh really  So it's kind of like  Who was on those videos  Why didn't the family  Get the videos back 
[02:21:30]  You know what I mean  So it's kind of a mystery still  Maybe cops just figured  They wanted to take them  For their home use  No you know what  I think  I think the killer's  On those videotapes  Really  Or the killer's wife  Girlfriend  You know  It could have been  A cop's wife  It's bizarre  Alright  Who knows right  What's going on guys  Hey  Hey Scotty  Yes  Did you ever figure  On following your father's steps  Make him proud  I am  Oh you mean sexually  No  In radio  Yeah  No sexual  Banging all these broads  Make him feel happy  Make any porno movies  Yeah  Make it almost  And you know it 
[02:22:00]  And you know it  You make it  And then you look at it  And you're like  Oh my god  I look like that  That's awful  Yeah  Then you erase it  Yeah exactly  Then you throw it in the trash  Does your wife  Allow you to bang  Other women  Like you can see  You see a regular  Sigurd Valdez  Hilda  No no  No not at all  We're monogamous  Alright let's go to Jack  We're newlyweds still  Yeah come on  We just got married  Alright alright  Jack  Ask us where we're  Old and bored  Jack what's going on  What's happening man  Hey  Just a question  I find it hard to believe 
[02:22:30]  That he's not actually  Making money off his daddy  Because  He doesn't make that much money  In the radio business  And I heard  Yeah there's no money in radio  He's making money off his daddy  I heard him refer to  You know his dad  As Bob Crane  If you go back to the tape  Probably about  30 times  As opposed to saying  What happened to his dad  Or his father  Or like a normal person  Would do  No it's like his dad  Passed away when  Scott was so young 
[02:23:00]  In a way  You know he talks about  Bob Crane  When he talks about  The person  When he was 4 or 5 years old  When his dad was raised  He talks about Bob Crane  When he talks about  The person  He refers to dad  When he talks about his dad  You know what I mean  No he talks about  Bobcrane.com  When he talks about his dad  Well what's mydad.com  You know right  I mean  No it should be  You know  My dad went through this  I do say that  Jack hello  Bob Crane  Bob Crane  Bob  That was his name  Yeah it's bobcrane.com 
[02:23:30]  By the way  Some people obviously  Get a little disturbed  With the fact that  You know you're making money  You're capitalizing  Off what he did  But I could care less  We haven't even made any money  There's been like  So many hits to the website  Whatever  We still don't have a publisher  For the book  We were going to self-publish it  We can't even  You know  We were going to self-publish  The book  The Faces of Bob Crane  And we got 5.6 million hits  In the first five days  On the website  And all these orders  And we can't even publish it ourselves  I mean because there's just  Too many orders  I mean there's a tremendous  Public interest  You can't find a 
[02:24:00]  It's bizarre  There's a tremendous  Public interest in this  Since 1978  No one has known  The truth about Bob Crane  And I'm here telling it  Setting the record straight  Right  You know  There's a bizarre movie coming out  Starring Greg Kinnear  As Bob Crane  Are you kidding?  No here's the thing  I wish I was  Let me say this really quick  Let me say this  Before we get to Greg Kinnear  Is that that's the thing  Somebody else can go out  A movie called  Propaganda Pictures  Can go out  And make a movie about Bob Crane  With the sole intention  Of making money  And exploiting him  And nobody says  Hey you're doing this  To make money  I'm putting the record straight 
[02:24:30]  Putting a book out  And everybody wants to go  On that angle  That's ridiculous  And the book's not slanted  In one direction or another  It's just the facts  It's just the facts  It's his whole life  That last photo  Naturally everyone  Wants to talk about  Well  That photo's been on CNN  That photo's been on MSNBC  It happened  That's the thing  As CNN does it  Nobody complains  That's what I say  That's his life  Yeah  Alright let's go to James  James you're next  On the Opie and Anthony show  James  Opie  Hey  James  Speak  Hey guys 
[02:25:00]  Hey what's up James  How you doing  Good  I got a quick question  Yeah  I don't know if your dad  Ever banged the German  Chick on  Oak Zero  That was his wife  He did  And then Scott was born  Oh I did not know that  Now you do  I did not know that  He put a little Carson there  Yeah I did not know that  He put a little Carson  But can you believe that  Greg Kinnear  Starring as my father  Can you find a more  Pasty white example  Greg Kinnear  Hey Earl  You're calling back  For what reason  No Rick  Tell me to call back  Every couple of minutes  To get an update 
[02:25:30]  Every couple of minutes  We just got an update  Hi  I'm just following orders guys  Alright what's going on now Earl  That wasn't going on  Two minutes ago  Well they're still doing  Some film in Channel 9 news  And everyone's wondering  Where you are  So Channel 9 is still there  And  Okay  Wondering  People are wondering  Why we're not just leaving  A radio show to come down there  Okay  Alright  I like calling that to them  It's okay  They're doing a radio show  Alright call us back  In two minutes  With another update please  He's just following orders  Alright  Yeah  Alright thank you 
[02:26:00]  God Earl  He's just inept  Kevin what's going on  Horrible  Nothing  I was just saying that  You know  If Scott really wants  To publish his book  He should self publish it  And do all the arrangements  Himself  I was going to man  It's just too much  It's like too much  It's overwhelming  I don't know how  I have more orders  Than I know what to do with  No I understand  What I'm saying is  That the cheapest place  To do it  And the most effective  Place to do it today  Is in Italy  That's where all  I'm serious  That's where all the books  Are being published  Who do we call it?  A Bob a crane  Pardon me? 
[02:26:30]  A Bob a crane  Bob a crane  Well you know  I'm just saying  That's where all  The technology is going  So  Great  Thank you for that  Bit of information  I'm coming  He  Italy baby  No you gotta go to Italy  We gotta go to Italy  Dave what's going on?  Hi guys  How you doing?  Hey  Scott  Question for you  Why  Why should anybody believe  You keep saying  What you're saying  Is fact  I'm presenting pictures  How can I  How can pictures  Not be real?  But how do you know  Exactly what occurred 
[02:27:00]  When your father died?  Oh no  Oh we don't know exactly  He doesn't  He just gave his  Opinion on that  Yeah but you keep saying  You're presenting  All the facts  But  I'm presenting opinions  And I'm presenting photos  Which are fact  Well you're presenting opinions  Photos are fact  What's your problem?  Nothing  It just sounds like  You keep saying  That your story  Is the fact  When it's been investigated  For  No we don't know  About the murder  The murder's a mystery  It's you know  We have ideas about it  What part of my story 
[02:27:30]  Are you wondering about?  No you just keep saying  That everything that you're saying  Is the fact  You were five years old  When your father passed away  No I was seven  When you were seven years old  So you really didn't know  You were a child  What did you know  What was going on?  You didn't know anything  That was going on  Well I know a hell of a lot more  Than you know  Say the National Enquirer  I mean did you do a full inquiry  And investigation  Into his death?  What part are you disputing?  And I'm answering your question  I want to  Did you do an investigation?  My opinion is  John Henry Carpenter 
[02:28:00]  Did not kill Bob Crane  My opinion is  That Scottsdale at the time  Was probably run by the mob  That's my opinion  That's not a fact  That's not a fact  What I'm presenting here  Are pictures of my dad  Doing radio  In movies  With his family  Having sex  That's fact  Okay  Did you ever  This is a yes  No question  Did you ever do an investigation  On your own?  Well no  He was seven years old  I'm hanging up  Who is he  An encyclopedia brown?  He was seven  But you know what  Yeah  I did start investigating 
[02:28:30]  The murder of Bob Crane  Because the cops tell you  When you're seven years old  Your daddy was killed  By this guy named  John Henry Carpenter  And you go  Okay  So he's killed  By John Henry Carpenter  And then like  As I get older  You know  I start researching it  And the fact is  They didn't have any evidence  Against the guy  They had almost no evidence  A little bit of blood  Was in John Henry Carpenter's car  They didn't even  They couldn't even tell  If it matched my father's  It could have been  Like a shaving accident  So many weird things  It's just  Yeah  It was OJ  It was OJ  In my opinion  It was OJ  It was OJ  It was Beretta  Roy what's up 
[02:29:00]  Hey how y'all doing  Today in New York  Come on  Hey  Hey Roy what's going down  Oh man I liked that show  Last night  With old Jim Burry  He cracked me up  What  It was on there last night  This is our newest listener  From Dallas  His name's Roy  He called up the other night  I didn't get to here  They must have  Cut it  Searching down there  You like last night's show  Oh yeah  It was good  What did you like  About yesterday's show Roy  I like old Jim  Was it Jim Brewer on there  Jim Brewer  Yeah he cracked me up  Yeah he cracked me up  And then  Bob down  Jim Brewer with his mom 
[02:29:30]  Right  Yeah was he with his mama  Yeah he was with his mama  Jim Brewer  You'd be on a Saturday night  Live ball with his mama  And talking about stuff  About growing up  Down in Long Island  Very funny stuff  We talked down here  Hey y'all gonna probably get  Down here at 3 to 7  Yeah  We're gonna fix  Get rid of old Ron and Don  They're fixing  Get rid of old Ron  Yeah  We're fixing on working on it  Yeah we gotta be  Moved down in Dallas  We're in the middle of the night  They got two more months  They're contracting  I think they're toast  Ron and Don  Their names are 
[02:30:00]  Yeah they're from San Francisco  They had like a bunch  Of queers down there  I got you  We don't like them queers  Down there in Dallas  Right  Yeah  Keep the queers out  Alright Roy  You like the Chaggers  Or what  Huh  You like the Chaggers  Yeah  Right on  You take  Alright  What time are we gonna be on tonight  You're gonna be on tonight  At 1.25 in the morning  Yeah I'll see Russ Martin  He's our local guy down there  He grew up down here  And he's gonna go to 11 to 3  I think  Then y'all gonna come 3 to 7  Is this our program director  From Dallas  No 
[02:30:30]  Is he telling us what  Alright Roy  Alright y'all take care  I'll be listening  Yeah call us next week  And tell us how the show's going  Alright  Bye New York  Thank you Roy  Roy  You guys are gonna kill in Dallas  I swear to God  God damn Roy  Again  I don't even know if they understand  What we say  Roy wasn't from Dallas  He from right outside  He's gone there  Gun barrel  Gun barrel of Texas  Gun barrel  Right  Gun barrel of Texas  Right outside  About 6 miles outside  I doubt  But the signal comes  Really good  And I hear you about it  Every night  Kurt what's going on  Yeah how's it going 
[02:31:00]  Alright  This guy's ridiculous  He's selling pornographic movies  Of his father  And yet he's trying to say  He's selling the story straight  It's like he's demeaning his father  What his father did  Was his own personal business  That's why he never published those things  That's why he showed it to everybody  He showed it to everybody  If he could publish it he would  And he's doing  He showed it to people  Who came to his house  He didn't try to make money off of it  To him it was like his own little personal hobby  His own personal collection  Hey  He showed it to reporters  And there's a movie  He showed it to  He wasn't trying to sell  Your father's dead for 30 years  And you're out there trying to  Make a buck on it 
[02:31:30]  23 years  The Kinnear movie that's coming out  You know you can nitpick all day  You and your little wife  Have been doing that concert  That's really annoying  The guy says 5  You said no  He's 7 years old  I say 30  You say 23  The point is  You're making money  Off of your dead father  You can't knock this guy  My father wasn't a hermaphrodite  I'd be selling pictures of him  You guys  The Kinnear movie that's coming out  Suggest that Bob was into S&M  And that he took pictures  Without the knowledge of the women  And that he was into dungeons  Oh in the movie  Yeah  That's what they're suggesting  In the propaganda film  And so that's the other part  Of the reason for coming out 
[02:32:00]  Because like you look in the book  It's like yeah  He had plenty of sex  He took pictures  You know  The women knew about it  There was no S&M  But it wasn't  He wasn't dark  Our own Old Dirty  Has something to say  Old Dirty  What's up Old Dirty  I don't know you man  But  I'm not  I'm not feeling  I'm not feeling  What you're doing with this man  I don't feel  I don't feel this right  I thought that was you  Doing his voice  I thought that was you  Actually  Old Dirty  I thought that was you man  No he's the real deal  I'm not feeling it  Not one bit  You know what  The other thing is it's like  Wait wait what's your problem 
[02:32:30]  Old Dirty  I don't know dude  I mean come on man  It's your Pop Dukes man  You know what I'm saying  You gotta have a little like  He's got the  Like yo what does your mom  Say about this  My mom is all supportive of it  She's like  It's been out  The deal is we are  Setting the record straight  Because people say  That he photographed these women  Without their knowledge  That makes Bob Crane a creep  You know what I mean  That makes Bob Crane  A really dark creepy guy  People say  That he was into S&M  That makes him even darker  You know people say  All kinds of creepy stuff about him  This is the truth  And this isn't just sex  This is his career 
[02:33:00]  This is his family life  This is his career  Right here  All this  Look at the family  That's just his rear  The family photo album  What do you think  Of the family photo album  Look at this  There's a teabag shot  Nice teabagging  Nice  This is the family photo album  There's pictures of him in there  Doing a radio show  With Jerry Lewis  With Marilyn Monroe  There's Bob doing the Bob shot  Who's the Bob shot  I'm starting to think  Your honey right here  Wanting you to get  Some cash flow  She married me  Before she even knew  About the book actually 
[02:33:30]  Oh yeah  Alright y'all  I don't know man  Alright y'all  And then what about  The picture of him  With his head bashing  On the bed  That picture's been on CNN  That picture's been on  Every single news source  In the country  Why can't I publish it  The other thing is  Every single record  That's out there  Every single screenplay  That's out there  Every single book  That's out there  Is put out there  For two reasons  One to distribute information  Or a story  Two to make money  It's weird that you're surprised  That these people  Are attacking you  No we're not surprised  It's definitely not  It's definitely not normal  It's a bizarre story 
[02:34:00]  It's not normal  To the average person  That you would  Show pictures of your dad  Having sex  It's not normal  But Scott totally  Grew up with it  No it's cool  I understand where  He's coming from  But I'm just surprised  That you guys are surprised  That other people  Attacking you  I'm not really surprised  But I've got a defense  I'm 100% behind you  Let me go to Diane  Diane what's up  Hey I just wanted to say  That I'm really sorry  All these creeps are calling you  Telling you how  You know just picking your life apart
