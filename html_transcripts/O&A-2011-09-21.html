<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Larry King’s unexpected profanity-laced introduction.  The hosts then launched into a disparaging discussion of Rosie O’Donnell's appearance and personality, referencing a past controversial interview with Tom Selleck.  This transitioned into critiques of "Dancing with the Stars," focusing on Metta World Peace and Nancy Grace.  Chaz Bono's appearance and physical transformation were also discussed using offensive language.  A significant portion was dedicated to an apologetic retraction of a previous on-air rant against Ralphie May.  The hosts then vehemently complained about outdated video clips on the SiriusXM website, targeting an employee named Gary. A phone call from a listener named Bill, a business owner, resulted in a homophobic tirade from the hosts. The segment concluded with a rundown of the hosts' upcoming engagements, including a mention of comedian Cowhead.

The show continued with discussions about the hosts' Twitter blocking habits, with one host boasting about his extensive blocking activity and the subsequent pleas for unblocking. A caller, Bill (an electrical engineer), complained about the show's content and management on SiriusXM, leading to a heated exchange with the hosts.  The hosts also extensively lamented the difficulties of booking A-list celebrity guests, citing Jonah Hill's appearance on Howard Stern while being in the same building as a prime example. They described the process as a "guest Ponzi scheme," directing their frustration at publicists and SiriusXM management. Harry Connick Jr. briefly called in to promote his Broadway show. The hosts then speculated about Sam's mom's comments regarding a women's club she attends.  Amy Schumer, a studio guest, discussed the recent roast she participated in, addressing the controversy surrounding a joke about Ryan Dunn and defending her comedic choices.

Amy Schumer and Ari Shafir were both guests in studio in the following segment. The discussion revolved around Amy's roast performance and the backlash, particularly regarding the Ryan Dunn joke.  Amy recounted details of the roast, including jokes that were cut and the audience's reaction to her targeting Mike Tyson, which included a story about a fellow roaster repeatedly punching Tyson's fist.  The conversation shifted to Amy's upcoming small claims court case against Sandy Kane, a recurring guest. The hosts and guests played and analyzed video footage of a previous altercation between Sandy Kane and the crew, which prominently featured food throwing, Sandy's removal from the studio, and the placement of feces in her hat.  The video also highlighted a large genital wart on Sandy, which was graphically described and discussed.  Strategies for the upcoming court case were discussed, with humorous courtroom antics proposed. Ari Shafir's contributions were less prominent than Amy's. The segment concluded with Amy promoting her shows and Ari mentioning his podcast.

The final segment began with a ranking of historical figures by current level of dislike, with Obama at the top, followed by Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.  This led to a highly offensive discussion of a children's anti-molestation PSA featuring Henry Winkler.  The hosts used extremely vulgar language to describe the video and its content, dissecting the lyrics with explicit jokes.  A lengthy, similarly offensive segment followed, focusing on a key lime pie and its convoluted backstory.  A phone call with Bobby, a woman involved with a women's club, resulted in highly inappropriate and sexually charged innuendo. The show concluded with discussion of Bobby's appearance, the upcoming court appearance, and future live shows and appearances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King. What the hell am I doing here?  Wait a minute, you want me to intro the Opie and Anthony show?  You gotta catch it.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite.  Oh, fuck yeah! This place is insane!  You guys like to cuss on that, right?  Yeah, a lot. It's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews and of course, your phone calls as well.  Well, it's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it. 
[00:00:30]  The show is so disordered.  Holy shit, it's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying this, well then, turn off God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one of the highlights of my career.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton? 
[00:01:00]  Morning!  Hi!  We're admiring Rosie O'Donnell's new girlfriend, believe it or not.  Her new squeeze.  Holy shit, look what Rosie's doing.  She's got some hot blonde on her arm.  She certainly does on that chubby arm of hers.  For some Broadway fundraiser, I guess.  It's in the Daily News today, the New York paper.  Of course, it's some Broadway fundraiser. 
[00:01:30]  It's like some hot strawberry blonde looking woman.  Yeah, yeah.  Got her arm around her waist.  Her tiny little waist.  Yeah, tiny little waist.  Not Rosie, of course.  Rosie doesn't have a tiny little waist.  No, no, no, no, no.  But it's just like everything else.  Everybody looks at a guy with a girl and goes like, oh, well, you wouldn't be able to get her unless, whatever, you know, then you mention money or career or power or something.  Yeah.  Same thing with Rosie.  Rosie is what amounts now to what we would call, especially in the day, a fat bull dyke. 
[00:02:00]  Like, that's what she amounts to.  No, honestly.  But we almost became friends with her.  You do realize that.  Speak for yourself.  We could have some celebrity friends.  It would be nice.  I never said shit to that woman.  It would be nice.  And what?  She would describe herself differently?  I forgot you don't like her because of the whole gun issue.  Yeah, I fucking can't stand her.  You despise her.  I despise her.  She fucking blindsided Tom Selleck on her own dumb fucking show about the gun issue. 
[00:02:30]  Well, you know what?  Tom Selleck should have been able to handle himself, Anthony.  He did.  He did all right.  He did.  He did okay.  But for a host to blindside a guest on an issue that, you know, it's a right.  Why don't you be quiet about that?  We've done some blindsiding over the years.  Well, because people are assholes.  So maybe she thought he was an asshole.  No, she blindsided him on a personal issue that she had that, by the way, is as much 
[00:03:00]  of a right as the right to free speech is.  Right.  And she just laid on him, and he casually started talking about it and getting into it.  And Rosie just continued to fuck him over.  Look how long ago that was.  Wow.  Like, Tom Selleck is still like Tom Selleck in that.  I don't think she looked good doing this, though.  No, of course not.  That's what happened.  She came off looking like an asshole.  But let me tell you something.  She still feels that way.  And that's when all the news stories came out, where everywhere she goes, she had armed 
[00:03:30]  security guards with her.  So the people that she's around are allowed to carry guns because, you know, she perceives  threats to her and her children.  And I guess she figures the best way to deal with those are with armed people, people with  guns.  What happened?  But you people.  But what happened?  What?  We were talking about how hot her chick was.  Well, I know.  Hot her chick was.  We'll get back to that in a second.  Now we're going back 15 years.  People that have a right to carry firearms.  Rosie O'Donnell doesn't want people to exercise that right because they're just people. 
[00:04:00]  She's Rosie fucking O'Donnell.  Fuck you.  And she does look like a fat bull dyke.  And she's with a girl that's much too attractive for her.  Was this 15 years ago or more?  I don't know.  Was that how long ago?  I thought it was more.  Fucking A.  I would guess 20.  No, it's not 20 years ago.  Was he plugging Magnum P.I.?  Jesus.  I would guess it's anywhere from 12 to 15 years ago if I had to guess.  Yeah.  But whatever.  Rosie's got a hot piece of ass.  Yeah.  That's all I wanted to mention. 
[00:04:30]  Hot piece of ass.  Note to self.  Avoid gun fucking talk.  Oh, no.  Never, ever.  I wasn't going to go long on it.  Just that's one of the reasons I'm not a big fan of the Rosie O'Donnell.  The Rosie.  You think she's going to be all right with being the new Oprah?  I think that likability factor with her is gone.  She comes off very abrasive these days.  She used to be...  Queen of Nice.  She was the Queen of Nice.  She had clear eyes. 
[00:05:00]  She had a smile on her face and kind of skipped through life.  Now she kind of looks slightly like Kathy Bates from Misery.  Yeah, I'm seeing a Kathy Bates thing going on there.  There's a little something different in her eyes.  And I think her time has passed her by to be the new Oprah.  I really do.  I think you're absolutely right.  I would bet money Oprah's just waiting for Ellen's contract to end.  And then they'll fucking scoop her up.  Bring that one over?  And move that lesbo over.  So are any women allowed in the talk show circuit and things that aren't lesbians these days? 
[00:05:30]  Or you've got to really be a fucking...  Well, you've got Ellen.  You've got Rosie.  Oprah's had the rumors, at least.  Wendy Williams?  Wendy Williams.  No, man.  Her fucking husband was glaring at us through that window and wanted to beat the shit out of us.  Oh, that's her husband?  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  I do remember seeing him.  No.  I think he was mad that we just didn't want to talk to her or something.  Why would we?  Is her show canceled?  I haven't seen it on TV lately. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, shit, yo.  Fucking Tony Bennett.  Maybe we just switched up the channels.  You know, we fucking blew the Tony Bennett interview.  We're talking about Liberace.  And he's giving 9-11 fucking info to Howard yesterday or two days ago.  He's bashing fucking...  The clip is everywhere today.  The American government, as far as 9-11 goes...  What a fucking...  I would love to have fucking smashed him over that.  I wish we knew, because we would have continued the discussion.  But you don't think...  No one thinks of it.  It's like, that's one of those things you don't think, to ask a guy.  You're trying to be respectful. 
[00:06:30]  He's 81.  No, but he was talking about it down the hall.  I wish we knew.  Yeah, we didn't even know.  Because, you know...  We're pretty passionate about what we believe.  80...  One of those fucking guilty guys who thinks it's our fault.  It's our fault.  The government's...  It's our fault.  Oh, that root cause shit.  Yeah, it's our fault.  It's too old to think that.  Really?  Dunce.  Anyway.  You would think, but...  Rosie, Ellen, Wendy, Tony Bennett.  This is a hell of a start to a radio show.  Tony Bennett.  Yeah.  We still had a good interview with the guy, but nothing that the fucking mainstream media 
[00:07:00]  was going to pick up on.  Well, they wouldn't have been able to...  Sam was filming this.  At least we had something there.  No, it's weird.  They did show a picture of Tony Bennett with the Howard Stern story.  Yeah.  And it was a picture from our studio with the Opie Anthony Mike flag.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You could probably find that.  That's kind of funny.  Thanks to the people out there that pointed that out to me.  I didn't realize.  I didn't realize.  I saw you...  Oh!  I saw you tweeting about dancing with the Stats. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  In between innings and whatnot during the Yankee game.  Yankees lost, huh?  No, the Yankees won.  Damn it.  Yankees won.  The Yankees won.  Where are we at with that?  Quickly.  Yankees...  Yankees...  They're in.  No, they got one...  Well, technically.  They got one more game, and then they clinched.  At least a wild card spot.  And is it true that the Red Sox fans were actually rooting for a Yankee win last night?  A Yankee win.  That's fucking crazy.  Yeah, they want the Rays.  I guess the hatred isn't that deep up there in Boston. 
[00:08:00]  Well, they do want the Rays to lose some games.  What happened with the Sox game, though?  Last night.  Did they win?  That's...  I was paying attention a little bit, and it looked like they were going to lose, and then  they kind of was...  They came back a little bit.  I heard they delayed the game.  Oh, they lost 7-5 to the Orioles.  7-5.  Yikesy-wikesy, huh?  But, again, the Yankees beat the Rays.  So, yeah, let's see what happens. 
[00:08:30]  The Yankees...  I got all the confidence they're in.  They look very good, the Yankees, man.  They really look good.  But I can't watch a game now without going,  Granderson!  Something Granderson-ish!  That is such a tool.  How does this affect the Jets season?  I just need to know...  Who are the Jets?  What team?  You know, the only sport that matters right now.  Is that an expansion?  Football, you know?  No?  Remember football? 
[00:09:00]  Foot what?  By the time they play the World Series...  Isn't that soccer in Europe?  By the time they play the World Series,  half of the regular season will be over.  For football.  Who gives a shit?  Football is happening now, sir.  I'm all about the boys' October.  That's what I'm about.  It's not even October yet.  Yay!  No, I know.  How many more games?  Yeah, they got like...  Eight, nine?  Eight or so games left in the regular season.  And then you got your, you know,  your divisional playoffs, and then your... 
[00:09:30]  Let's be honest with each other here, sir.  They don't need to play 162 games anymore  in this day and age.  No, but you know what?  Baseball's a fun, little relaxing sport.  You could sit and watch.  Like, I could go back and forth  to dancing with the gays  and then watch the game.  It's not like a crazy thing.  It's on all the time.  Baseball, it's kind of cool.  But the season, actually,  the length of the season,  they play a lot of games,  but the length of the season itself  doesn't compare to fucking basketball 
[00:10:00]  that seems to play year-round.  Yeah, but you're avoiding football.  And don't BS hockey.  I didn't bring basketball into this discussion.  Oh, I did.  Football, where every game fucking matters.  Every game matters.  And you said relaxed.  It's a relaxed game.  No one is relaxed in this day and age,  so you don't need a relaxed sport anymore.  That's kind of nice.  And you could pay attention  to football season and baseball season.  Not really.  Yeah, you kind of can.  You need all your energy  to root for your team.  There's two few games in football,  and when Sunday rolls around, 
[00:10:30]  you could turn on the football game.  Do you realize within two weeks  your team can be out of it in football?  That's intense.  Oh, I know.  It's crazy.  Okay?  Crazy.  Your team could lose 12 in a row.  It's like, well, all right,  they got a little losing streak happening here.  Yeah.  And you still have a chance.  Well, I don't know.  You can't lose 12 in a row in football.  See, that's another thing.  Personally speaking,  I'm not that big a football fan,  so I could coast through the baseball season.  But what is it going to take  for you to get into football? 
[00:11:00]  It's amazing.  And you got that red zone at your house.  I got the red zone.  I like the red zone for certain games.  Why don't you like football?  What happened to you as a kid?  It all goes back to your childhood.  I think it was the jet game  that my dad took me to at Shea  when they were playing at Shea Stadium.  He has an answer.  And he took me  because little Anthony had to make wee-wees.  So I went to the restroom at Shea Stadium.  And let me tell you something.  Back in those days,  the restroom at Shea Stadium  was nothing but a giant trough  that men,  big fucking burly men pissed at. 
[00:11:30]  With big penises.  And little Anthony  didn't want to take out his wee-wee  and make pee-pee  around all these men.  But my father was saying,  Come on!  Take a pass while you're down!  We're missing the game!  You know?  Little Paris thought  you missed Emerson Boozer  out on the field.  Was it Emerson Boozer's time?  Emerson Boozer was out there.  Nice.  Joe Willie.  Joe Willie Namath  was tossing the old pigskin.  Sure.  And baby Anthony was crying  in the men's room 
[00:12:00]  because there were too many people.  And I was like being carried away  by the crowd.  Were you scared?  I was frightened, Jimmy.  I was frightened.  You should have just grabbed  on to someone's penis  and they would have  grabbed a cock like a fucking vine.  Swing from it.  They would have got you  out of that men's room.  It was frightening.  Let's grab on.  Why didn't he bring you  into a stall?  A stall small.  How old were you?  Don't be a pussy.  I would guess,  let me think.  Maybe eight, nine. 
[00:12:30]  Oh yeah,  you shouldn't have been crying.  What's wrong with you?  That's a little too old  to be crying.  No, not for me.  Believe me.  I was still a whiny little crybaby  up until about 12.  Until my penis slipped in a vagina.  Then I found a whole new world.  Women gave me new things  to fucking cry about.  The lack of pussy.  We don't talk about it often,  but I'm with you.  I think I was a crybaby  up until about 12 or 13 too.  I was the biggest crybaby.  And then the second 
[00:13:00]  the head of my dick  slid in between vagina lips,  I turned into a man.  Crying was a thing of the past.  I cried out the hole in my dick.  Did you have to go on your tippy toes  to get your penis over the top to pee?  Because I hate that shit  at Islander games  where the fathers  are putting their kids  next to the urinals.  Oh, the big tall urinals?  And they have to go tippy toe  to get their little tiny penises 
[00:13:30]  over the top.  It's a coming of age thing.  But at that point,  you go into the stall  and pee like a fucking girl.  Yeah, you don't want  fucking Puerto Rican pubes  on the head of your dick  because you got to lay it  on the fucking urinal.  It's terrible.  You do wonder about  some of these guys.  It happens in this fucking place, too.  Yeah.  Where all  they just take out their dick  and half their pubes fall out  into the urinal.  What the fuck's going on, man?  They just soak their underwear  in Rogaine. 
[00:14:00]  You're right.  Some people unzip their fly.  You look at some of the toilet seats  and they're like,  what the fuck happened?  How is this possible?  This guy's got the mange  on his pubis.  I understand a pubic hair  here and there.  Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes you're like,  how the fuck is that possible?  It's just a wreck.  It's like a chick fight  happened in the fucking stall.  It's like his pubes  is going through chemo  or something.  Horrid.  Anyway,  Dancing with the Stars.  Oh, that's right.  I tuned in  to a little of that  in between  innings of the Yankee game. 
[00:14:30]  And  what a  just what an  uneventful,  unexciting  show that is.  Not that I expected,  you know,  an amazing fucking  piece of showmanship.  I don't understand it.  I don't understand why,  you know,  we call it the mainstream  out there.  Because I said it yesterday.  I really believe the people  that are now listening to us  on a regular,  you know,  regular basis.  They see through  all this shit.  They need a little more  in their entertainment  and a little edge and stuff.  I don't understand  some of these shows  that are on TV 
[00:15:00]  that do massive ratings.  Huge numbers.  Who would actually sit  and watch that fucking show  without goofing on it?  I think it's  I really think  it's the Midwest  mostly.  And then I think  you got some,  you know,  women,  city folk  on the East and West Coast.  Sorry.  Well, we don't talk  to those women.  Entertainers,  things like that.  Women, yeah.  We don't talk  to those type of women,  I guess,  on our show.  about the show  at the water cooler  the next day.  But like I said,  which was the fucking  cyanide cooler.  Yeah.  Fucking yappy bitches.  Cyclone being the one. 
[00:15:30]  But it's like  you got these  professional dancers.  I guess you could  respect what they do,  I guess.  I don't care either way.  And then they have  to dance with a partner  and it's like putting  a truck tire  on their ankle.  Yeah, yeah.  They're just carting  around a ball and chain  like the old days.  A bag of bones  or something.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess Ron Artest  got knocked off  yesterday.  Whatever the fuck  he's calling himself.  Meta world peace, brother.  Meta world peace.  Meta world peace, brother.  Meta world peace.  Well, let me tell you something.  How about the  Meta piece of ass 
[00:16:00]  that he danced with?  She's gone now?  We ain't gonna see her  no more?  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you something.  That's the hottest  fucking thing on television,  that bitch.  Wow, she's fucking hot.  Holy shit.  And she's got that  dancer fucking body on her?  Yeah.  She was stunning.  And then to what?  Thank God  they got kicked off.  I couldn't take  watching her  and dance with her.  Look at her go!  We're watching a video  of it right now.  I'm just freaking out.  You should be happy  that they're no longer 
[00:16:30]  together.  Oh, God, he smacked  her ass!  She just bent  all the way over.  Get out of here, Meta!  Why did he decide  to look like Dennis Rodman?  He really did.  With the blonde  fucking hair  and the other shit  in his head.  And then, I guess  it was them,  Meta,  against Nancy Grace,  right?  Yes.  That pig.  And Nancy stated,  look at that  fucking...  She's fucking amazing.  Is she a good player?  Oh, yeah, he's all right.  Is he?  Who?  Who'd you play for?  Who? 
[00:17:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  Meta World Peace.  Meta World Peace, yo.  Who does Meta play for?  He plays for this team.  It's pretty good.  Their legs,  they're just fucking crazy.  He didn't answer his question.  Is he a Nick?  What?  Yeah, he's a Nick.  Oh, he...  Well, of course.  Who does he play with, though?  LeBron, Joe.  Oh, sorry.  You said something else.  I always misunderstand.  Is he a minor hate?  Yeah, he plays with LeBron  and Chris Bosh.  LeBron.  Who you don't like.  Hate.  Yeah.  Brass, motherfucker.  So Meta got kicked off?  Yeah, Meta World Peace  and that fucking amazing... 
[00:17:30]  Wait, who was up?  Nancy Grace, Meta?  And Meta, yeah.  That was it?  So they...  Oh, fat legs.  Did he get old?  Oh, giant man tits is...  She's going next round, I think.  See, you're into the show.  No, I'm not.  What's wrong with you?  I just know people hate her.  But the Midwest...  And this shows us with the Midwest.  Let me tell you something.  The Midwest did not want to watch  that large black man  dance with a gorgeous white woman.  Didn't Emmett win, though?  Didn't Emmett Smith win last year? 
[00:18:00]  Who was he dancing with?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Was it a beautiful white woman?  Jimmy's right, though.  Emmett did win.  I think it was the one we had in here  when Jericho was in here.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but she kind of looked like  she could have been a little, you know...  Yeah, she looked a little more ethnic.  Definitely olive skin.  Yeah, but this one is, I mean, a blonde.  This is the Midwest.  This is every Midwestern father's girl  that's out on the cheerleader.  You know what I mean?  And he's looking.  He turns the TV on and goes,  Ah!  Ah!  My baby! 
[00:18:30]  But he was a terrible dancer.  I bet black people voted him off  because he was an embarrassment  to all of them.  He was terrible.  He was a terrible dancer.  He was trying to do the fucking...  Cha-cha-cha?  Yeah, the cha-cha-cha.  But he had a hat on  and he was trying to do the fucking...  Yeah.  What's that dance that fucking...  the old black guy used to do there?  Not the dink-a-dink-a-doo, but...  The soft shoe?  Yeah.  Hidey-hidey-hidey-ho.  Yeah, he was doing the...  Hidey-hidey-hidey-ho.  Hidey-hidey-hidey-ho.  He had his hat. 
[00:19:00]  He looked silly.  He should have been dancing  down the steps of Shirley Temple.  Yes.  I was just saying it wasn't a very...  He was a terrible dancer.  Oh, he was awful.  You like that Nancy Grace, I guess, huh?  Oh, she is.  Let me tell you.  She's terrific, isn't she?  She is what I don't call it.  She's a performer, Mopi.  She's a performer.  Multifaceted.  I'm obsessed with her nostrils.  Oh, God.  I almost lost sleep over her nostrils yesterday.  What a pig.  I fucking hate nostrils.  Especially, start looking at nostrils. 
[00:19:30]  It's the ones, some people have a nose, right, where it moves up a little like this in front.  The tip is a little high.  It's a little piggy.  So then you see the nostrils a little more, it drives me fucking nuts.  Does it?  Yes.  Because sometimes a little bit of a pug can be cute.  See?  If it's done right, but hers go.  Or if it's kind of, or if the nostril on the side, you can see from the side, drives me nuts.  Oh, right, right, right, where it comes up like that.  So if this is pushed up a little, it's been driving me fucking insane lately. 
[00:20:00]  I bet a lot of people see boogers in her nose in the winter.  Yeah, for sure.  Like Nancy, Nancy, you got a little, you got a little, right there.  You got a dab.  Is that from having work done?  Probably.  Oh, yeah, she's had work done.  I mean, is that why the nose is like that?  In my honest opinion.  Oh, I don't know.  Maybe a nose job or something.  Yeah.  And I saw a little bit of, oh, God, she is like a fucking football player.  How about you get in shape for the dump show, piggy?  And I saw a little bit of Chaz Bono.  Hot, right?  Wow. 
[00:20:30]  And then those pictures came out, the topless pictures.  Yeah, yeah, I did a little tweet on that.  Where all you see is one of these giant scars where they removed her tits.  She should be arrested, man.  As a she, you can't walk around like that.  How did she get such small nipples back?  Did she ever have big womanly nipples and tits?  I don't think she had big boobies to begin with.  Really?  I think those nipples are fake.  No.  You think they were worked on? 
[00:21:00]  Why?  Because you don't want to take your shirt off with no tits and have giant girl nipples.  That would be silly.  Those aren't real nipples.  Maybe they shaved them down or something.  I think maybe they cut the areola.  So a baby can't suck on them.  And then they stitch it back in and then use the rest for ring toss.  Because there'd be a hole in the middle.  Isn't that illegal, though, to walk around like that if you're a girl?  No, not like that.  Why, man?  She is topless.  If I didn't know that was Chastity Bono and had a vagina under that giant gut belly, I would think that was a guy now. 
[00:21:30]  How the fuck did this thing get a trucker's belly?  I posted a side-by-side last night after I watched this of little Chastity Bono.  Who was never cute, by the way.  They wanted us to think she was cute.  Really?  She had cross-eyes.  She was weird-looking.  She was cross-eyed.  At least just the youth thing.  See, look.  There's a... 
[00:22:00]  Go to the top picture.  You can see her eyes are crossed.  And they would...  Look at that.  Yeah, she's weird-looking in that picture.  But at least it's a girl.  Little chubby cheeks.  Yeah, yeah.  See, look, look, look.  She's singing with her mommy, Cher.  And all her mommy wanted was a girl.  Yeah.  And that's what it turned into.  Holy mother of Christ.  Wow, that is just...  I will never understand that.  No.  That's where my tolerance ends. 
[00:22:30]  What the fuck is going on there?  It looked like it was a Christmas special she's singing in.  And that's when she was trying to pull it off.  Yeah.  She was a girl.  You could see she had a food addiction at that point, though.  You could see she had kind of a Nancy Grace neck.  Oh, yeah.  All the better to pile food down.  She's a little chubby there, but looks like a nice lesbian woman.  That's like a storm pipe neck, just so you could feed shit down it.  She's a neck like one of those portable air conditioning things.  Like one of those, yeah, accordion-like tubes. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, that neck has a purpose.  I don't have respect for Chaz Bono, because she's going through all this change,  but she's like, you know, showing everyone pictures of her topless  with these big, awful scars.  She wants to say, look.  How about you keep some of that shit in private?  Go all the way to the right.  You need to be famous that bad.  Hold on.  Go down.  Go down.  All the way to the right.  No, no, no.  Up.  Up.  Keep going.  Oh, boy.  There.  Yeah.  Let me see that.  She was never good looking.  Nah, she was never good looking. 
[00:23:30]  She had some weird Bucky tooth thing going.  Her lips always were the part that I remember about Chaz Bono.  She wasn't ugly, but she was never good looking.  Even back then, those lips were just made to fucking suck clitoris.  She never, ever wanted a penis in that mouth.  She still doesn't want a penis.  No, no.  That's how bad it was.  Yeah, that's something.  So you saw Chaz on Dancing with the Stars?  Yeah, I saw Chaz doing more just like whatever that Chaz dance is.  There's something out there on the stage, but there's this some bit of femininity in 
[00:24:00]  the walk that you just look and go, I don't know.  It's a girl.  It walks like a girl.  Yeah, it walks like a girl.  You give Chaz Bono, that burly fucking truck driver looking man, a baseball, and you will  see the girliest fucking throw, guaranteed.  No girl could cover that up.  Yeah, they probably shouldn't even allow the operation unless you can throw like a guy. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, here's a baseball.  Here's a baseball.  This will decide if we turn you into a guy or not.  And if it's that...  Nope, you're not ready.  Sorry.  Sorry.  That's like, no, sorry.  Sorry, you're not ready.  You're a girl.  You're a girl.  You are.  So we got a couple of clips.  You play baseball like a girl!  She dances pretty good, though.  That walk.  That was such a girl walk, but she dances at least okay for a big, fat person. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's like watching Rerun dance.  Remember that?  Yeah, she's got a Fred Berry vibe to her.  Doing that Fred Berry thing.  Chris Farley and a little Belushi tour.  A little Belushi.  Belushi knew how to move as a fat guy.  You know, fat people.  You know, big, fat slobs.  And then that little turn of the head and dumb smile.  Who does her smile remind me of?  It's the smile that's getting to me.  It reminds me of somebody.  I don't know who.  I've told you.  I think it's Hard Rock Johnny.  Is it Hard Rock Johnny?  He really doesn't want to hear this, but I see Hard Rock Johnny. 
[00:25:30]  I'm seeing a little Ralphie Mae.  A little Ralphie?  Yeah.  By the way, Ralphie, get the word out to Ralphie Mae.  We don't hate him.  No, we hate him.  Jesus Christ.  I went off on a compound show.  On Ralphie?  Yeah.  Yeah, I kind of did.  Why?  Where did you get that idea from?  Did you mean it?  Well, I was probably a little inebriated, but the truth did come out.  What happened?  Well, I might have gotten on.  Someone might have brought up Ralphie Mae. 
[00:26:00]  I might have gotten on and said something to the effect of that when Ralphie's on, the show sounds like this.  So, I was watching Dancing with the Stars last night, and let me tell you, Nancy Grace has huge arms, and those nostrils look like the air intakes on the hood of my Mustang.  And I might have gone on for another ten minutes just on that theme. 
[00:26:30]  And then I might have said something like, Ralphie Mae on the show, fuck Ralphie Mae.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It might have been a lot of luck, but Jim, I'm not a comic.  I know.  But, so, so, I was, I was, I was extending the olive branch, and then, uh, the subject might have been brought up that Ralphie Mae did help the show out at one point. 
[00:27:00]  Which he likes to bring up a lot.  Which he likes to bring up, but let me tell you something.  With you on that one.  I then refuted it, uh, on the compound show, saying, look, fuck that, we'd have gotten out of our own jam up.  Uh, so, I guess Ralphie, uh, tweeted, and said, well, you know, you won't have to worry about me, I won't bother you anymore, and stuff like that.  Jesus, what are you doing?  Look, look.  He's a nice guy.  I didn't, I never said he wasn't a nice guy. 
[00:27:30]  I never said he wasn't a nice guy.  I just said, sometimes when he's on the show, it gets a little overbearing.  And, and, uh.  What part?  The laughing?  The laughing.  Can we tell him to laugh less?  The, nah, it's almost like trying to calm down a dice thing, you know?  It just, it's gonna happen.  It's, it, it, it, I think in some ways derails, uh, the program.  Um, what, what can I say?  I was just being honest.  Oh my god. 
[00:28:00]  I, I'm so happy I brought that up.  Hey, look, Ralphie, I apologize.  I, I do apologize.  So you wanna get him back on?  I was being a bit, a bit rash and a bit brash.  So let's get him back on the show.  Uh, and, and if he wants to come on, I, I have no, um, uh, uh, problem, um, you know.  You're not sounding convincing.  No.  Let's get him back on the show.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  That's kind of awkward. 
[00:28:30]  Is it really?  Not really.  Or is it just the way it is?  It's just fun.  I love, uh.  I love where no holds barred.  That's, that's what happens, uh, you know.  And, and believe me, that's what used to happen, uh, during afternoon drive when Anthony was  able to drink during the show.  Uh, there was a bit more, um, you know, drunkenness that would come out.  And sometimes it comes out on other, uh, forms of media. 
[00:29:00]  Sure, sure, sure.  Uh, and, uh, it certainly did, as far as Ralphie's concerned.  I, uh, I may have gone off.  I just feel bad that he tweeted that, you know.  Well, I do apologize if I hurt his feelings.  Where he's like, you won't have to worry about me anymore.  Well, see, I, I, you know.  That's just, because in the end, he's such a nice guy.  Well, he's the nicest of guys.  There's nothing wrong with him.  Ralph is a good dude.  But let me tell you something.  There are plenty of nice guys, plenty of nice guys, that just don't quite fit sitting in the chair. 
[00:29:30]  And I don't mean size-wise.  I think he's done good radio for us.  A little fat joke.  The first couple of times.  Oh.  I'll agree with you.  He's a good dude.  Yeah.  Look at him.  I agree.  He's a nice guy.  I have no qualms about the niceness of Ralphie Mae.  He's one of the nicest guys we've ever had on here.  He's very good stand-up.  Always, uh, courteous and cordial.  Really good stand-up.  I'm not very familiar with Ralphie Mae's stand-up.  All I've seen is the, uh, Dancing with the Stars version of comedy that he was on. 
[00:30:00]  And, uh, last comic.  You know, it's not the reality.  Was he on the last comic?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's how he got his, he made it, that's how he made his bones.  Didn't he do one of our virus shows?  Yeah, he's a good guy.  He did?  How did that work out?  I don't remember if he did it.  I mean, uh...  Did it work out well?  Who remembers?  Did he do well?  I honestly don't remember.  I'll be completely honest with you.  Yeah.  I don't even know if he did it.  I'm not even joking.  Did Bill Burr ever do it? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, Bill did.  You remember that, huh?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, Bill had a rough, kind of a rough time.  Yeah, but boy, did he fucking slay.  He turned it around, though.  Yes, he did.  Oh, he certainly did.  That was, that was like the turning point for Bill Burr.  Ah!  I know Jimmy Schubert did our virus show.  Jimmy Schubert coming out of a urinal.  He was terrific.  A wow sticker on it.  He was great.  Port-a-potty.  Talking about potato flakes and stuff.  Oh, jeez.  Hey, yeah, well, look at this guy.  A fan behind me.  He's spraying potato flakes all over the girls. 
[00:31:00]  All right, why don't we move on, man, before...  Yeah?  A little uncomfy?  Not really.  No, not really.  So did you want to hear these things?  The Metta World piece gets voted off in the Harry Connick Jr.?  What's...  Oh, yeah, Harry Connick Jr. came out and sang a song, and then, what's his name, Bergeron?  Yeah, Tom Bergeron.  Tom Bergeron walked up to him and went, ah, thank you so much for being here.  And in a plug that could have been more shameless than anything Jimmy Norton's tried to pull in his entire career here. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, really?  He threw in a plug that was so ham-handed, it was embarrassing.  So what are we doing?  The interview has the plug, if you just want to...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The only reason I pull both is because I just saw he's a douche.  I didn't know what made him a douche.  He really was douchey.  So now you have every possible evidence of his douche-ness.  He was great in Independence Day, though, let me tell you.  Why would we play his performance?  Wouldn't it be some of that crooning shit? 
[00:32:00]  Let's kick the tires and light the fires, big daddy!  Are you two sucking each other's cocks?  Could fighter pilots be more gay than they were in Top Gun?  Yes, they can be.  What about Metta World Peace getting voted off?  Do we play this?  Why do we play this?  That's just a moment in pop culture.  Very good, Sam.  Fuck that shit.  A moment in pop culture.  And the singing is there in case Anthony thought the singing was the douchey part, but if he thought the plug was the douchey part, all we have to play is the interview.  The plug was the very douche.  And we don't even have to play the whole interview. 
[00:32:30]  No, him and his.  He's a crooner.  I'm a crooner.  What fucking year is it?  He does stink.  Oh, he does that crooning thing.  I love it.  How y'all doing?  Pretty good?  You having fun?  Are all these guys trying to be the next Frank Sinatra?  I'm a jazz crooner.  I'm from fucking...  On a clear day 
[00:33:00]  Rise and look around you  And you'll see  You are  On a clear day  On a clear day  I'm a stupid crooner  A type of music  No one listens to  Yet I sell millions  No shit  How this guy has a giant career  I think he's the only crooner that sells records these days 
[00:33:30]  That's why  Every crooner fan  Now, the guy with the horrible lisp  That no one wants to talk about  Michael Bublé  Michael Bublé?  Yeah, can we do the lisp?  He's a crooner  We haven't done the lisp bit in a while  Is he a crooner, though?  Or more of a soft, fruity singer?  He's like a pop crooner  Alfalfa was a crooner  On one of the episodes of A Little Rascal  Oh, God, I'm sick  He's played at Spanky's place  Can we do a little of the lisping guy?  I mean, no one brings it up  Except for us 
[00:34:00]  They love this fucking guy  And he has a problem  That lisp  What kind?  What was the one track we played?  Is it a Cindy Brady lisp?  Oh, yeah, it is  Those are the worst  Oh, yeah, it is  It means your tongue's too big  By the way, if we're attacking today  I thought we weren't going to attack today  Yeah  Oh, boy, do I got something fun for you today  Oh, do you?  Oh, I love fun trees  I love a little pecking attack  Nothing big  This will be a good peck  Just a little pecking  This won't be  Rip some meat out 
[00:34:30]  And then move on  This won't be all that warfare  With the guys down the hall  But I got a little peck today  Oh, the guys  I love  And I mean this  I love some of the people  That follow me on Twitter  Oh  Because they keep me abreast on everything  Oh, someone rats someone out, did they?  As E-Rock looks for that  Oh  Remember  It's under the sandwich  And there it is  I need your help on this  Yeah  Because Jimmy wasn't here  What  What did we bitch about last week? 
[00:35:00]  Jesus  No, with the big meltdown I had  Where I felt like I was completely going crazy  You know what I'm talking about?  Let me see  There's some type of thing  That we're not real  We're kind of stagnant in this media  That  Mike suck  Mike suck  Your life in the compound  Sounds and looks way better  Right  Than what we're doing here  We would like a visual element  Visual element  Good  To the show  Keep going with that  Good  Some cameras  Good  Lighting  Good  Things that could be turned on  At a moment's notice  And actually give a live feed 
[00:35:30]  Right  If everybody  Is saying  What  If everybody in here agrees  At a guest or something  That we can  Then have a live element instantly  And then the video clips  From that  Oh, good  Keep going  Put on a website  What website?  The SiriusXM website  And be up to date  And not be from, you know, June  And then we went to SiriusXM's website  Uh-huh  And there was a clip of  Steve-O  Good  Was on there 
[00:36:00]  And we yelled  An appearance from what amounted to  The beginning of the summer  Where it was still a little chilly  So we yelled  And screamed  And we said  The babysitters down the hall  They just don't understand  How to work this show  Right  Right  So you would think  If you were one of those guys  You would have got on it  And maybe  Changed the video clip  On SiriusXM  Yeah  Six days later  I present you  The Steve-O clip  From June  These fucking idiots 
[00:36:30]  Wait a minute  Who runs  Who actually does this website?  These idiots  There has been  Discussion as to fixing this program  Oh, there's been some chatter?  How about  How about less discussion  And more fixing?  And just do it  And just do it  Perhaps  It's been six days  Opie, Opie  Please  Open mind here  Perhaps clips aren't available  Um  To put on the site  Perhaps  Our staff  Has not made clips available  To the website  Well first they asked for  Tapes 
[00:37:00]  And I said  I'm not giving any tapes  Because last time I gave tapes  To somebody  We didn't get them back  Exactly  And so then they said  Okay, well you put them on a disc  And I said the video files  Are too big for a disc  Uh-huh  So I need a hard drive  Uh-huh  Uh-huh  And then yesterday  I got FTP information  Oh, to upload to an FTP site  We're getting there  Yeah  Okay  So we still have the Steve-O clip  From June 9th  Even though we bitched and complained  And yelled pretty damn loud  A week ago  Or six days ago  Who runs the website  Because I think the web presence 
[00:37:30]  It's a consortium  It's a consortium of people  Is really, really bad  So who actually does that?  Like who makes that decision?  I don't know who runs the actual website  But if we have  I think we have guys  That are overseeing this channel  I'm not really sure sometimes  That guy  Whoever he is  Yeah  Should be going to the people  That run the SiriusXM website  And going  Look, what the fuck?  This is not acceptable  My guys should not have a clip  From June 9th  It's always these guys' fault though  Yeah, somehow you guys  It's always Sam's fault  And Danny's fault  And Travis's fault  I agree  Yeah, yeah 
[00:38:00]  I did try to make it clear  To everybody involved  That I am not a videographer  I'm trying to make everybody know  That I don't have time to be a videographer  Well, you know  Much like a Googler  You picked up the ball  And run with it  You can have it back  You picked up the balls  And strung them across the bridge of your nose  The point being  That's pretty much what goes on here  The point being  We can make this quick  I'm just amazed  That after that big, huge, over-the-top bitch session 
[00:38:30]  It's still  I sounded awfully bitchy that day  You would have thought  That something would have been taken care of  Six days later  You would have  But they're talking  They're getting close to having a new clip up there  That's good  As long as discussions are going  And maybe we'll hear those magic words  We've kicked it upstairs  Yeah  This type of show  Could easily  I mean easily  Have a new clip every day on SiriusXM  Easily  Without even fucking trying  Absolutely  But we're getting close, Anthony  To replacing the June 9th video clip  That represents the Opie and Anthony show  That's very cool 
[00:39:00]  We're getting close  I don't have time to make a new clip every day  Especially since it's not my job  But that's all that happens  I mean they said that other people who make clips  Don't have time to do it  So why don't you  Literally, here's the thing  What do you mean they don't have time?  We're one of the big fucking shows here  Supposedly  It's being shot on a hard drive  That could be uploaded in five seconds  Exactly  There's no  We should have access to it  We can't rely on them to do it  Because they're never going to do it right  They're never going to do a good job for us on the web  Well the point is 
[00:39:30]  It's on an SD card  His name is Gary  And he's got to get his shit together  And get with these people  And figure out what the fuck is going on  And why we still have a Steve-O clip  After we bitched about it six days ago  It's I blame him  Now I could pull a clip off an SD card  In a matter of seconds  And then  And then  Of course  Just have it on a computer  That they can then access  And do whatever they please  With that clip  Put the clip up  Right?  Put it up  It doesn't need to be edited  With fancy graphics 
[00:40:00]  Put  Have  Already in the system  Fancy graphics  That's nothing  You have a logo  That's a basic clip up there  You slap it on  You slap the logo on  It's a piece of cake  You send them the clip  They put it up  And it's there  That's it  And the funny thing is  After that bitch session  Where I sounded very bitchy  I'll be honest  With the people today  Yeah  Gary actually apologized to me  And said  Yeah it's my fault  You know  You're right  And blah blah blah  But now six days later  It's still a problem  Right 
[00:40:30]  I'm gonna propose  We set up a folder  On a shared drive  Oh fuck  Listen to you  But you don't have to be  Proposing this stuff  This idiot  Are you making  A proclamation  I'm making a proclamation  That we set up  A folder  That is mutually shared  Shared  In Britain  That made me laugh  All day yesterday  That was hilarious  Sam  That's not your responsibility  God bless you 
[00:41:00]  But it's the guy  That makes way more money  Than you  Should be figuring out  These systems  Yeah  End of bitch session  Here's the clip of  Fucking Harry Connick  God damn  Junior's interview  Cronin  Does Howard's stuff  Go on the serious site  Or his own site  I don't know  Well Howard's stuff  Goes on his TV  It goes on TV  No no no  But the stuff  That's his web presence  Is it his stuff  Or is it on this serious site  I don't know  I honestly don't know  The answer  I don't think it goes on  He has his own  Yeah  Yeah he might put  Tiny little preview clips up  But that's because  He's got a TV  But here's the deal  He has a different 
[00:41:30]  You know  Yeah he's got a different  Situation  So I don't even give a fuck  What he does  That's television  No but I'm saying  It's on his site  That's what this stuff should be  This should not be on the serious site  I do think  But here's the non-problem  I have with serious  Putting shit on their site  If we had three cameras  In this fucking studio  Which right now  I'm already  I was going to laugh myself  Excellent  If there were three cameras in here  With anyone 
[00:42:00]  Anyone just running them  When there's a  It doesn't have to be constant  It doesn't  Whatever  If something's popped up  And we go  Hey by the way  Go to the SiriusXM website  Go to  SiriusXM  Slash  Opie Anthony live  And you will get a live feed  From the studio  Of this interview  With this person  We have them sign releases  And it's a live webcast  Of what's going on  In this program  At a given moment  That's you know  Exciting  Pertinent  Interesting 
[00:42:30]  Whatever the fuck  That will drive traffic  To their site  Like motherfucker  And it gives us  That visual element  That is important  In fucking 2011  Almost 2012  And then they can sell  Banners obviously  Right  Then sales can jump in  And actually sell  Some shit  On it  It's brand new  It's a webcast  On the actual  SiriusXM site  Why not  I just don't like  Relying on them  Because I don't trust  Their internet department 
[00:43:00]  I don't trust  Their advertising  Videoing  Why  I don't know  I don't trust  Have the discussion  With these guys  I don't know  And how about  You get permission  They allow a clip  To be you know  Shown on websites  Or Facebook  But in general  They don't want it  I don't know why  I don't understand it  I don't know why  It's 2011  But the fact is  Stupid Gary  And don't fucking  Run into me  After the show today  I don't want to  Even see you today  Just get this done  And send me an email  That I finally  Correct  You finally corrected  The problem 
[00:43:30]  By the way  Enough with the  Talking shit  Do something  By the way  Did you get  Blindsided yesterday  By them  In the hallway  With what now  I don't even listen  I know I was talking  To somebody  I think it was  Something  I'm not even joking  We're doing in December  And November  And they needed  Like a free date  In December  That we had  Anyway  I do remember  Just saying  Yeah yeah yeah  What did I say  Yeah yeah yeah  I have no idea either  Seriously  I just said  Let me check my calendar  What are we doing  In December  Which I don't even have one  I think we're doing  The poker tournament 
[00:44:00]  From one of the casinos  Yet to be named  I think  In Atlantic City  Or maybe  One of the ones  In Connecticut  And then  We had to move  The date  Because in November  We also have something  Else going on  That we're working on  Right  But whenever I see  One of them  Like I think  I'm making it out  You know what  It reminds me of  You know that scene  In Platoon  Where Charlie Sheen  Opens up  His fucking hood  And starts seeing  The Vietnamese  Charlie  That's how I feel 
[00:44:30]  When I see him  Because I'm like  I'm safe  I think  Oh fuck no  Oh shit  It's one of them  No it's two of them  Like they come out  Of the walls  They literally  Emerge from walls  You look down a hall  You don't see them  And then they're just there  Blocking your exit  And it's just talk  And I click my claymores  They just talk  There's just a lot of talk  Fucking junior  Falls asleep on watch  I can't get out  Into the elevator  It's just a lot of talk 
[00:45:00]  All the time  It is  Bill and Philly  Go ahead  Oh Bill  Good morning  How you doing  Good Bill  I was just saying  Listen to you  It's your show  Why did it take  Until September  So you personally  Realize that a clip  From June  Was on your website  That's a very  You know  We delegate responsibilities  You know what  That's a fair  Fucking question  It is  I just assumed  They were doing  The right thing  Which is probably  Dumb on my part  Guys that yell a lot  Usually they're reacting  But usually  I run a business 
[00:45:30]  And I never yell  I always tell myself  First of all  I don't yell anymore  How's Amway selling  These days  Run a business  Shut up  Every once in a while  I have a flare up  But I don't really yell  I know  Why are we even talking to you Bill  What's your point  Go ahead  Oh you're a shitty manager  I'm not a manager  Manager  What are you  Fucking middle management  You're a faggot  You're a shitty manager  And then he hangs up  We do radio  That's a fag move  Faggot  Little queer boy  Go order more Amway soap  For your business

[00:50:30]  Wow  Oh Harry Connick  Right  Yeah  So what  He plugs shit  Yeah it was a ham handed plug  That as I said  Rivals Jimmy Norton  Who probably  Would want to plug  That he's going to be  Where  Where are you Jimmy  I'm not thinking about Tampa right now  Tampa  October 20  Oh I fucked up  September 29th  October 1st  That's next weekend  Yeah  I know  I'll have this Thursday  You can do great in Tampa  By the way  Cowhead helps us there  Cowhead fucking rules  Yeah he's great man  He's turned a lot of people 
[00:51:00]  On to this show  And I want to thank Cowhead  Hey fuck that guy  Jesus  By the way  Spectro is right  I will be blocking  All bills on Twitter today  Oh yeah  Sorry if your name's Bill  But I have to do it  I went on a block fest yesterday  Because I block some people  And then I get tweets  From other people saying  Dude why did you block  And then they put the name  Yeah  Could you unblock him  He really didn't do anything  And I'm like  Look motherfucker  I got like over whatever  70,000 followers 
[00:51:30]  I've probably blocked  A total of maybe  At most 100  Out of all those  That's a lot  And that  I looked at mine  I looked at probably 50  I've blocked 7 people so far  If I said  That's it  Can you see how many  You blocked  Is there a way to see that  I think there is  Probably somewhere  But it's like  It's never  You had to take it  Literally  No but I was  Legitimately curious  Assuming that I could  Never be funny  But that's okay  It's not true  I knew 7 was a joke  I wouldn't say it was  Woody Allen's moose pit  But I fucking  Did recognize it was a joke 
[00:52:00]  But the bigger picture was  I was actually curious  Cunt  There are people that  And I told people  I go  Don't fucking beg  For your dumb ass friends  To be unblocked  Because if they're blocked  There's a reason  I don't block people  For going  You know  You suck  Or whatever  That's  People are going to do that  I understand that  Your show stunk today  Whatever  You haven't blocked  Total Twitter families yet  I do that all the time  No I haven't  You have to man  Well now that they 
[00:52:30]  Come on and try to like  They go  Dude why'd you block my friend  He didn't do anything  Blocked  Blocked for trying to  Come on board  And help  Help your buddy out  Fuck you  You're gone  And then I put a warning up  And said look  Don't fucking do this  I'll block you  And people didn't take it seriously  So I blocked  I think more people yesterday  Than I've ever blocked  In one deck  Isn't Blocktober  Right around the corner  Block  It's not only  Jocktober this year  It's Blocktober  It's exciting  We are going to  Fucking flush some people  Out this coming month 
[00:53:00]  Uh oh  We are going to do  Some flushing  Yes  I assume my number  Is going to go  Drastically down  After October is over  I don't think so  Because you'll get  New followers  With everyone you block  Well the problem is  That's why  You block someone  They just start  Another account  Because they're obsessed  With following us  For some reason  Even though they hate us  It's bizarre to me  They get all upset  And then one guy  Literally went to  Facebook  To plead his case  On my fucking Facebook  I'm like blow me 
[00:53:30]  On the ONA Facebook too  On the ONA Facebook too  You know  I've been a listener  And I  Well you said something  Really fucking stupid  Right  So fuck you  And now I'll block you  From fucking Facebook too  I don't give a shit  Remove the comments  Yeah yeah  Remove comment  Blow me  Some of these people  Just annoyances  Just fucking  A chinch bug  We're being called  Good team leaders  That's good  Team leaders  That's good  We need a team leader 
[00:54:00]  Bill  You have no energy left  We kicked your ass  Yeah stop  And then you try to  Play with us  I was on the phone  What?  Sorry about that  I was on the phone  Please  What is your business?  Go blue sky  Another graphic  For your company  I'm not what  I'm not what you think  I've been in  Engineering business  For 26 years  Drive a choo choo  What is the engineering business?  I'm not fucking Amway  No no  When you say  He doesn't like Amway  Yeah but when you say  Engineering business  That's being vague  What is your business?  What is your business?  No no no  What do you engineer? 
[00:54:30]  Electrical engineer  If you build a building  I design the electrical systems  Oh that's cool  Okay  Wire pull  Okay  I probably used the wrong word  I know you're not a manager  All right  Romax puller  Hey Romax puller  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  A wire puller  Can you move your wires?  Can you move your wires?  I gotta notch the plate  And drop a duck through  All right boy?  Can you do that for me?  Can you do that for me?  Can you move your  What?  I used the wrong word 
[00:55:00]  Sorry manager  All I meant to say was  Name's on the show  What are you fucking looking at?  Could you pull that wire  Up in the attic?  Because I really gotta run something  More important here  That is a little bigger  And harder to run  Than a fucking wire  I hope your 90 degree  Fucking hole drill  Kicks back  And hits you in the chin  All right Bill  You know what?  Hold on  Hold on  Bill  Bill  I'm actually gonna give you a chance  I heard something in there  Yeah  Our names are on the show  Right  And you make a really good point  The problem is  I never wanted these guys 
[00:55:30]  To be in charge of this channel  Because they don't know  What the fuck they're doing  I requested other guys  And for whatever reason  They can't do it  Or don't want to do it  So we're stuck with these guys  That don't really understand  How to push a show like ours  And it's really frustrating  Yeah  I mean  I've been listening to you guys  I was your first  Next-end customer  Two dollars extra a month  First one  You weren't the first one  First one  If I look it up  You were  Maybe we got off on the wrong foot  What's your last name? 
[00:56:00]  I can't tell you that  What town are you from?  Doylestown  Bill and Doylestown  You were actually  Hold on a minute  It's Doyle and Bill's town  You were the 789th subscriber  To our channel  Yeah, we just looked it up  That's pretty damn close  Not bad  Not bad, sir  That's pretty good  You got a few million  That's pretty close  That's pretty good  Well, we probably  That's all I was saying  If I used the wrong fucking word  Manager  I just meant to say  If my name was on  I'd say three months later  About something  I'd blame myself  Bill  That's all I'm saying  I just use you as fodder  To have a little fun 
[00:56:30]  In the end  In the end  I don't even care  To be honest with you  I heard you come  Call you back  Look, we're getting  We're getting along now  That manager shit though  When are you getting  The home run  When are you getting  The home run  To the box  Get the home run  To the box  Go ahead  Hey, shit brain  I don't install it  There you go  Oh, sure you don't  Why can't you guys  Get along  Go ahead  Go to Granger  Go to Granger  And get some 20M  Fucking breakers  You prick  Go ahead  Go get some more breakers 
[00:57:00]  And pop them in my  Fucking box  You dickbag  If you guys are all  Working on the same  House or building  Why can't you get along  I don't know  The electrician  Shitting in a spackle bucket  Right  So whatever  I used the wrong word  I apologize for that  But that's all I'm saying  If my name was on the show  I wouldn't bitch about  Something that was in there  For three months  I'd fucking blame myself  I'd build things  Do you know how important  That is  Bill  It's Doyle Hargrave  Bill makes some good points  I mean the fact is  It's a good point  You can't deny it  It's a good point  I said it already 
[00:57:30]  I can handle saying that  The fact is  Eric Logan knew  How to run this show  And knew how to work this show  And since then  We haven't had anybody  And one of the problems  Sirius gives these guys  A million channels  To look after  So they don't even have  One fucking focus  Right  My kid's in college  He does that shit  He downloads videos  Just like Anthony said  It's easy  Just like I said  Well our guys will be blamed  Unfortunately  Say later  That's bullshit  Tell E-Rock to come in earlier  Oh shit 
[00:58:00]  Now he's talking  He does come in late  He does come in late  Now he's talking sense  We can all agree  That E-Rock sucks  Now we're all together again  Get the fuck out of here  You got time to do that shit  Imagine saying  You don't have time for that  Get the fuck out of here  Exactly  Putting that stupid video up  Look  And by the way  Bill I'm just fucking around with you  I  We love you  We love you  I have no problem with you  Mr. fucking splicer  Go ahead  I need a dimmer switch  In my dining room  Jesus Christ  Want to help me out  No I know 
[00:58:30]  You were in the field  You're a tough guy  You were in the field  I'm a tough guy  I like you better  When you're on the radio  You're funnier  Thank you sir  We know you had a fucking  Install ductwork  I know it stunk  So what  Fuck the fuck  You know  Alright  Alright  Come on  See you fellas  Have a good day  By the way  We worked out  The electricians  Always the easiest  Fucking shit to move  I don't want to hear it  We worked it out  The electricians  And then the plumbers  And the ducts  Were always the hardest shit  To fucking move  Do you want this  Harry Connick Jr. clip 
[00:59:00]  I sure want to hear  His fucking ham-handed plug  So what happened  Because that was an hour ago  He crooned  He did a little crooning  On Dancing with the Stars  And then Bergeron  Came up to him  And was doing like  After he sang interview  Fuck  And then  He just plugged  It was a horrible  Like trip over the plug plug  Are we going to have to  Talk to people now  After ranting again  No  No  Can you just let us  Leave the building  Without having to look at you  No  One day is all I ask  Good to have you 
[00:59:30]  In our ballroom  Harry  Man this is exciting  Is it fun  Yeah it's really fun  By the way  Your show  On a clear day  You can see forever  On Broadway  Opens  Previews in what  November  November  And then we open  The show in December  Really  That's the first time  Spider-Man went for years  You could take longer  I know  I hope we don't take  As long as Spider-Man  I'm excited  I've never sung that song before  And so this is the first time  I'll be singing it  Eight times a week  In about a month's time  You've done good 
[01:00:00]  Don't you think  Oh thanks  Thank you  How do you think  This cast is doing  I mean it's only day two  I don't know  If you've seen the show  Last night  Could form an opinion here  But  I think it's pretty cool  I have my personal favorites  You know  Want to tell us who they are  I'm pulling for J.R. personally  Okay  Fair enough  Oh my god  My sister is in the army  So I  You know  I'm proud of what he's doing  What he did for our country  What he continues to do  And  I kind of  I'm feeling  I'm feeling the Chaz vibe man  Oh really  Okay  Yeah 
[01:00:30]  I just met Chaz up there  I'm feeling it  Alright  I got a feeling  That's a new bumper sticker  Yeah  Harry Connick Jr. everybody  Thanks buddy  Thanks for being with us  I guess it's cool to like Chaz  If you're in  That's the Hollywood environment  Yeah yeah  Chaz I think is going to win  The whole thing  Because  It's just a freak show  It's like seeing  The amazing bearded woman  In a circus  It's a circus act  With dancing  I think that's what we're seeing  Right now  Yeah  What are we doing next 
[01:01:00]  I guess eating  We could either do  Bobo's date  Or we could see  If Sam's mom's awake  Because I didn't forget  Oh shit  Because I don't see  No fucking brownies  In front of me today  I think  We gave her an hour  Thank god  Oh  See I thought  In person  Oh my goodness  I was over at the house  Last night  While they had the replay on  I didn't realize  They hadn't heard it  How embarrassing  Was that for you  I'm just sitting there  Eating dinner  And my dad  Because my dad  Is a psychopath  And not only  Does he listen  To every show 
[01:01:30]  But he also reads  Not only all my tweets  But every  At  Not Sam mention  Wow  And he reads them  To my mom  Like they're funny  Oh no  And when  Jim was on  On the air  And said my mom  Was going to a women's club  To learn how to masturbate  Under  Whatever  Under the  Crochet  Under an afghan  I said that's what  Goes on in women's clubs  In the context of our discussion  I didn't just bring it up  Out of nowhere  Jess was disgusted  And my mom 
[01:02:00]  Was just sitting in silence  And my dad  Was eating corn on the cob  And laughing  To himself  Shoot  Shoot his corn  And he goes  That's a funny line  That's a  It's not funny  What was the catfish line  For yesterday  What was the catfish line  I don't know  But I do remember  That once the segment  Was over  And we turned off  The radio  My dad said  Okay now I get  The tweet  About the cocoa butter  On the butt cheeks  Oh shit  Well is she gonna 
[01:02:30]  Talk about this  Women's club  For us today  If you want  Because we're really curious  I would like to hear  What goes on  In this women's club  Yeah because  We're very suspicious  I mean if you  Want her to  She's not awake yet  But you can always  Wake her up  Hey  Is Roland in yet  Yeah  Is Jonah Hill  Gonna be on our show  Today  I don't know  I mean no  He's done our show  A million times  Hasn't he  We have Amy Schumer  And Ari Shafir  But no Jonah Hill  Today  Well  Last time he was on  He was very  Thankful to us  And remembered us  For being the first 
[01:03:00]  To have him on  But he's gonna be  In the building  And Moneyball  Is a big movie  I think he's already  In the building  No big stars in that  Right  I think there are  Oh  Why are we getting  Mr. Brad  Pitt  Is what I wanna know  Where's Roland  We've done enough  Favors for enough  Publicists  We've taken enough  Shit fucking guests  That we're supposed  To get some kind  Of payback  And I think  What are you trying  To say honest Anthony 
[01:03:30]  Your new character  I think Brad Pitt  We deserve  No no no no  I hear that  We'll get to that  Oh I'm saying  Roland  Yeah what is  Bullshits us  With these guests  That we're  Obligated to take  Because somewhere  Down the road  In his guest Ponzi  Scheme  It's gonna pay off  I do  At some things  But we never  Reach the top  Of the pyramid  Adam Sandler  Was gonna come on  Oh remember  After we took  All the people  From the movies  He's running a guest Ponzi  Scheme  And we're constantly  At the bottom  Of the pyramid  I think we were 
[01:04:00]  Supposed to get  Charlie Day  I remember that  Oh yeah  Well whatever  From Always Sunny  In Philadelphia  One of my favorite  Shows on TV  Right now  Whatever  When he's back  In New York  I heard  Well I heard  When he was done  Filming  Was what I heard  Where's Roland  Well he's not  In his office  So he may be  Are you trying to say  That a lot of the stuff  Never comes to  Fruition  Yes  Oh that's a big word  I am saying that  I am saying  That we are offered  Shitty guests at times  We've had some 
[01:04:30]  Great guests  And I don't want that  Being brought into  This argument  I would say he was  A very famous guest  Yes  Very famous  Yeah  That's what I meant  We've had  We've had  Some great guests  I don't want that  To be a distraction  In this discussion  I don't want Roland  To come in here  And start spouting off  Some of the great guests  We've had  Because I'm acknowledging that  But all I'm saying is  We have taken  Shit guests  Under the guise  That we are going to get  The next grade up 
[01:05:00]  Oh no  The next level  Oh no  Oh he shouldn't  He should have stayed  In the bathroom  And then that does not  Come to fruition  Roland  Hello Roland  How are you this morning  Jets  I had a very simple question  Yep  Are we getting Jonah Hill today  He's in the building  Yeah he's doing Howard  No are we getting him though  No  I know he's doing Howard  Was the question  Did Opie just say  Hey is Jonah Hill doing Howard  Well I was about to explain  Girlfriend  Oh no 
[01:05:30]  No  The way his rep did it  He has two films coming out  Within a month and a half  He's doing Howard for this film  Oh of course  And then we get for the next film  I guess the next one's going to be  The shit film  Why is that though  That's a good question  Why would he just do us  If he's in the building  Why not just do both  Yeah  Why don't you call his publicist  Holy shit  I ask a million questions  What do they say to you  When you say  Sorry no  Sorry no  But hasn't Jonah done our  He's done our show a lot  I said we got him  Before anybody else 
[01:06:00]  We always get Jonah  Yeah  He has a great time on our show  Yeah he thanked us  What's the problem  No answer  Hey by the way  That publicist  That company  Whatever it is  That runs Jonah Hill  Who else do they handle  That we've had on the show  The whole entire  Joy to Epitop crew  Anyone else  Yeah I mean  Steve Coogan  They rap  We've had  John Searley  We've had all these guys  Yeah I know who they are  I used to be with them  Yeah  Yeah  The thing is 
[01:06:30]  Any lower end people  That we've had on  That we've taken  You know  Maybe for a favor  Not that no  Because okay  Alright  If it's ever offered  Never even approach us  We are never taking  A piece of shit client  From that publicist again  Yeah no  I mean  I argue  I have this in  Well we're not attacking you  I know you're doing your job  But it's frustrating  That we know Jonah Hill's  In the building  Hold on hold on  And he's done our show  Way before anyone  Really knew who he was  And to the point  Where he even thanked us 
[01:07:00]  Yeah no we got him first  He was the first radio show  With you guys  Yeah  Yeah  And I argued  And argued  Everybody argued  They're saying  Why him  Why are you doing  Just Howard  Is it  His rule now  That he only could  Only certain people  Could do his show first  Jesus Christ  What about Brad Pitt  He's in LA  Yeah I know  How about we get Brad Pitt  If you give me 100 grand  I'll bring him in  Cause you have to have  Private planes  Donate to the charity  A candy bar 
[01:07:30]  Well you're a bunch of douchebags  These guys like  When you're uber famous  Yeah  You're technically not paying  For them  But you have to do  All this shit  It's a GMA  Exclusive Brad Pitt  But you have to  Flew half their staff  To build four homes  For homeless people  In New Orleans  Why is he so fucking important  I don't know  I wouldn't  I would talk to him  Cause he's Brad Pitt  But I think he stinks  Yeah  I've always thought he stunk  I've been saying that for 15 years  He's terrible  I never thought he was a great actor  You don't like him  In Inglourious Bastards  I liked him in that a lot  It was good to realize  Oh there's a guy 
[01:08:00]  Who shouldn't be there  I've been watching myself  In a film  I liked him in Fight Club  I'll be honest with you  But in general  I think he's a bad actor  I liked him in  I liked his character  In Twelve Monkeys  Twelve Monkeys  It was that lunatic  I gotta watch it again  Lunatic kind of guy  Maybe he plays that well  Kind of crazy  It was Fight Club  He played well  I think in  What was that other one  California  The one with the K  I liked him in Seven  I saw him in that scene  With Morgan Freeman  And Kevin Space  I just think  Wow he's being  Very outacted  By both of those guys  Oh yeah 
[01:08:30]  In the car together  Really  It was uncomfortable to watch  Yeah and he says  New movie Moneyball  It's awesome too  Well Jonah's in that right  Yeah that's the one  Yeah that's why  I thought you know  We  Gonna get Brad Pitt  But what happens  To like a Jonah Hill  He forgets  A-lister  That he's in the building  That has Opie and Anthony  I always wonder  That part of it  I honestly think  Where he doesn't know  The people say  Hey look  We only have time to Howard  They have to run across  To Today's show  We'll get these guys  Next time  I promise  That's what they probably tell  Well they might even say  Oh yeah they were busy  Publicers will say anything  Yeah yeah yeah  To make them 
[01:09:00]  Like when Paris was in here  Her publicist  Isn't gonna tell her the truth  That she was awful  She's gonna spin it  The way that it looks best  For her and the publicist  At least her show is doing well  No it's not  It's off the air  Oh literal Jim  Yeah that's why I argued  And argued for Jonah  It was just like  I said like  What's  I go we had him  Why can't he come in  I go  What about 15 minutes  And then  Yeah let me check on it  I'm kind of  No disrespect to  You do your job  But I'm kind of tired  Of taking guests  For 10 minutes 
[01:09:30]  Like I don't  I certainly get why  A guest does Howard  He's got a reputation  I get that  Sure  But I'm tired of just  Grabbing them for 10 minutes  Before they leave  Like it's a stop by  And they take a quick  Piss in our urinal  And then leave  And we have a large  Enough audience  And believe me  I love talking to celebrities  I know but that's the way  They do it now  Then we should just say  Fuck them  To these guests  I mean I know  That's self destructive  But I'm kind of  It's not helping us  Nobody gives a fuck  That we had on Tony Bennett  Like they don't care  No  They don't care  They care that Tony Bennett 
[01:10:00]  Was on Howard  Saying 9-11 was pretty much  Our fault  Well in an hour  You'll get more out of  You know what I mean  So you have an hour  With somebody  You'll  In 10 minutes  It's hard  Correctamundo  That's the point I'm making too  So it comes off  Looking like we're just shills  Because we just ask them  The basic questions  Because we know  They're in and out so fast  Yeah  No one would think  When Tony Bennett walked in  They'd go hey  9-11  But in the course of a discussion  That might pop out  Yeah it might pop out  We don't have that time  With these guys  Well yeah  Well he was supposed  To only have 45  But he ran the extra 20  Which is fine  But it shouldn't affect 
[01:10:30]  But yeah  It shouldn't affect us  But it does  But the problem is  They look at it overall  The serious time  So they go okay  We have an hour and a half  Of serious  Well  If it takes an hour and 20  Then they go okay  You got 10 minutes left  The Jonah Hill is very disappointing  I know  We've been around with him  For a long time now  We're being treated like  And there's a certain word  I know  And I know  I know  There's going to be  Someone down the hall  Going  Can I see for a minute  What's going on  Oh no no no  Oh no no  They will  They will  No no  There's no reason  I bet on Jesus 
[01:11:00]  And his lovely beard  Someone's going to ask me  That question  But we asked  I know  You have to answer the question  It's a fair question  You want to know  Why is that coming on  I believe Roland  I believe  So there's no reason  For them to ask you  After this discussion  Because that's why  His publicist  Is in the building  Trying to  Trying to  Stop and ask  What's up  Yeah  I guarantee you  It's probably coming from  Howard's side  And again  I don't take it  Indictively  It's literally  What makes me 
[01:11:30]  The go to show  So next contract negotiation  I have something  You know  It's like we're all trying  To fucking negotiate  So if I get exclusive guests  That don't go and do other shows  That makes me the valuable show  It's business wise  I get that  Yeah  But I wish somebody  Would just say that  So it would be  But the problem  You don't  I mean  It all goes unsaid  And that's what drives me  When are we getting Clooney  He never does press that  What  He just  He stopped doing press  Why  After that fucking  Hunk of shit  Airplane movie  He should stop doing press  Unless he's apologizing  For that fucking 
[01:12:00]  Enough with these fucking  These fucking  They don't give anything  These actors  They're terrible interviews  He's got a movie coming out  Eyes of March  That looks awful  I just don't like the word eyes  Who are we getting  Pedestrian number three  Is that who we're getting  On that one  No  Are we getting cop number four  Maybe  Are we  You know who  Some of my favorite guests are  This role  Uncredited  Oh  They're brilliant  See if we can get  The gaffer from the movie  Maybe he'll come on 
[01:12:30]  If he can swing by us first  Yes  So that's two yeses  Show us the  I'll bring him in  Intricacies of duct tape  And how to  Put him on wires  What's Jonah Hill's next movie  That he promised  It's a babysitting movie  A what  He's a babysitter type  Ah there you go  Exactly  I bet Brad Pitt's not in that one  Exactly  Then we should just say no  Then as a show  We should say no  And we will  Because literally  We have to  Because it's bullshit  Yeah yeah  It really is bullshit in the end  None of these actors  Give us anything amazing  None of them do  Right 
[01:13:00]  None of them do  And remind them  Go look  Because I bet you  No offense  They're going to need help  With that movie  Yeah  So you tell them  Look you know  Your guy didn't  Come through  You know  Talk to the guys  For money balls  So they're not interested  Sorry  That's the game we play  Fuck it  What uh  It's ridiculous  When is DiCaprio coming in  When do we get Leo  Leo  Anything  You guys give me  A blank checkbook  I'll bring them all in  Really  It costs money  I hate that  For their charities  Oh that's retarded 
[01:13:30]  They got enough money  For their charities  I pay charities  You do  Yeah  And then I'll go on a show  Nice  What the hell's that  Nice  I'm not asking anyone  To pay my charities  To go on a show  Is he still a fat fuck  No  No he's real skinny now  Jonah loves some weight  I was talking about E-Rock  I'm sorry  Oh god  You're so mean  This isn't Jonah being a dick  I get like  No one told him  No I know  He has not a clue about this  And the publicist  Doesn't want to start 
[01:14:00]  A fucking troll  Between the radio shows  So they're probably  Not going to say the truth  Which is look  We've been requested  To just do this show  This time  And then come back  And do you guys  Next time  No one just comes out  And just says that stuff  Publicists  All right  And Winnie Cummings  Is in the building too  Is she doing  Yeah  Okay  I wouldn't take her anyway  No I don't want her  She played her game  A while ago  Fuck her  Oh yeah 
[01:14:30]  Your show's cucka  I watched  Some of it on  What the fuck  God  That's how he looks now  It looks weird  Holy shit  How come fat people's heads  Don't get skinny  When they get skinny  That's just weird  He's a bobblehead doll  Of himself  Wow  That's weird  I would like to talk to him  About that  I guess we can  All right well  Oh well  Roland it's not you  No not at all  No it's not Roland  Don't call him in  And there's no reason for them to  Talk to you about it 
[01:15:00]  There really isn't  Okay  Good  Yes  Is that going to be good Roland  Are you in the clear  Nah  They always love meetings  You know that  Yeah so we can just talk more  I know  I'm just going to  Be time to sleep a lot more  I know we're in the talk business  Yeah yeah  Just take a snooze  When they talk to you  It's great  I did that once  Wow  Wow did they  Unload on my fucking ass  Holy shit  We're in the talk business  They should be in the do business  Do something  But this is where the company  Could help us out too 
[01:15:30]  And say if these guys  Like if they're doing other shows  They don't throw the weight  Of the company rats  Like I know that it's nice  To have a celebrity in the building  And believe me  No one's a bigger whore  For a photo than me  Sure  But if you got 20 million subs  You got a lot of people  You have a lot of weight  To throw around  And they obviously can't control  And shouldn't control  Who's fucking Stern has on  But the rest of the fucking platform  They do  Yeah  And they don't do that  They're just like okay  Fuck Obi Anthony  All right  Thank you for doing this show  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  So shows that are just  Blowing us off 
[01:16:00]  Afterwards  They'll just say  Oh yeah  Go do Raw Dog  Go do this  They don't give a fuck  That they're blowing us off  Even though I know  It's a political thing  Yeah  Because I've gotten emails  From certain performers  I won't say who  Because it was a confidential  But like  Won't that make Howard mad  If I go on  And it's like  First of all  I don't think so  And second of all  Are you as a performer  Like why don't you ask  Comedians like Louis  Who come on  Or Patrice  Or all these great comics  We have  Are you that afraid  Of upsetting a person  Yeah  Nick  Any of these guys  Right  Like are you that scared 
[01:16:30]  As a comic  I would hate to be a comic  Who is a coward  I would fucking hate that  Well the one saving grace  And the thing I'm psyched for  When Mission Impossible  Comes out  The new one  Tom  Fucking Cruz  Nice  Right here  On the Opie and Anthony show  We won't get Tom  We will get the rope  That suspended him  Off the Burge Tower  You guys should hang yourself  With the same rope  That was in the movie  Tom Cruise  What about that  Roland  What's that looking like  You working on it  Domination Scientology  From now on 
[01:17:00]  Well  That would be the first thing  I'd ask him  That and about  That would have to be  The first question  That and I'd ask him  About his beard  His wife  Shit  I always make that mistake  Oh like  Like he was ever  Coming through this  Fucking door  You blew it though  I couldn't  It's my fault  I'll take the blame  I'll gladly take the blame  For something that would  Never ever happen  I'm so taking the blame  Pin it on me  I don't care  Wow  Jonah Hill's head  Is just gigantic 
[01:17:30]  He's had to buy  All skinny jeans  Look at him  He's got hipster pants on  He's gotta be thinner  Than all of us  He's thin as a pin  How is that possible  And we only had  Judd once  And he's a good dude  He would come out again  But it's like  These publicists  Give these guys once  We don't fuck with them  We treat them really well  They always leave  Having a great time  And they still  Don't bring them back  Yeah  And that's what's annoying  It's like we get them all  Like we had Ron Howard  Do we have him once or twice  I think he was once  Ben Stiller once 
[01:18:00]  These guys  As ten minute pass throughs  And it's like  As much as  Believe me  I love my fucking phone  I know that  I'm almost like  Fuck them  We should even take these guys  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I know that they think  Alright we'll do  Opie and Anthony a favor  But the audience for this show  Is a lot fucking larger  Than they're giving credit for  Yeah  And then  Jonah Hill should be here  When he's got a real  Big huge movie  Yeah  Not when it's those other movies  That all these guys go through  It's not Jonah Hill  It's every guy in Hollywood 
[01:18:30]  Goes through that shit  Russell Brand stopped  They all stop after a while  And it's not like we  Fuck  But you know what I'm saying  This cutesy English bullshit  It doesn't do anything for me  With his Rocky Dennis head either  Right  He was fun when he was on  And we don't fuck with him  We got along with him  And something happens  Ask how those giant fucking  That titted monster wife is  Fuck him about that  Publicists are a big part of it  But English firms  Giant tits  God look at those things  You know as a performer 
[01:19:00]  When I go to Tampa  I know I want to do Cowhead  Because I like Cowhead  And when I go to fucking  When I go to Seattle  I'm thinking I gotta do BJ Shea  Maybe because I'm in radio  But I'm also aware of what I gotta do  Press wise  I know who I have to see  And it's like  So performers can't be totally bailed out either  They fucking know  But some of them are just lazy  Yeah  Jesus  God damn  Are they real?  Katy Perry's tits are fucking fabulous  Are they real?  As far as I know 
[01:19:30]  Yeah  They look fucking real as shit  So weighty  I bet you lift it up  Drop it  And we go  Ka-chum  Ka-chum  Ka-chum  Just three  Just three barely moving  Little  Ka-chum  Ka-chum  Ka-chum  Three  Like a snare drum  They're so tight  You don't like when they bounce  Like a slinky  Oh Christ  Right  You fucking put her on the edge of stairs  And her tits are walking down the stairs  Alone in pairs  Makes a slinkity sound  You don't like when it gets sloppy?  No  I'm not into 
[01:20:00]  Slow old slinky tits  Ah well  The Jonah Hill is very disappointing  Yeah  It's not Roland's fault  No  Not at all  No  It's like an Oscar type movie too  No shit  We never get that  Yeah yeah  We get these guys when they  Know they need the help  Or a book  We always get them for books  And when they know the movie is not gonna do well  We get them in  Dumb book  And that has nothing to do with Jonah Hill  Every  Every successful  You know actor in Hollywood  Has the really good movies  And they get a bunch that aren't so good 
[01:20:30]  And we always get the guys  When they know the movie isn't so good  To try to push people  Yeah  Gerard Butler came for a really good movie  What?  Gerard Butler came for his Oscar movie  This one  Yeah  It was good  Roland  You don't have to defend yourself  Right  Well  We're talking generally  You're right  Gerard Butler was here for a really big movie  That's right  You're right  Gerard Butler's a good star  But in general  Jimmy's right  We get them when  You know  Everyone knows the movie needs help  And that's because  That's their publicist  That's not  The only exception to that 
[01:21:00]  Was Dreyfuss  Who came in for  An amazing movie  That wasn't a very good movie  Oh that's right  We didn't even get him for Piranha  You know who comes in  Because he likes it  Was fucking Rogan  Comes in because he likes the show  Yes  Those are guys who  Fucking legitimately  Want to do the show  Jay Moore loves doing the show  Dice loves doing the show  Ralphie Mae  Ralphie Mae loves doing it  Poor Ralphie  Alright  Is it tomorrow  Ralphie's available  Yeah really  Your act is getting bad 
[01:21:30]  Roland  Yeah  I noticed that one  Look look  If I'm a little cranky  I'm blaming it completely  On my  Mother  Fuck  Commute  To  In and out of this  God forsaken  Shit hole city  With this  This fucking  Savage fest  That goes on every year  The UN General Assembly  In New York City  Because  The city's not bad enough  When it's just  The city  And people having to go  In and out of work  In the city 
[01:22:00]  Let's get dignitaries  Diplomats  In 25  30 car long  Caravans  Of flashing lights  With closed streets  That you can't even get  Out of the city  They chase you around  Like a rat in a maze  It's  It's  In fucking  Furier  And then they let those  Black SUVs park  Wherever the fuck  They want  Oh yeah  But regular schmo  Trying to make his deliveries  Will get 15 parking tickets  In one day  But these guys  Park wherever the fuck  You want 
[01:22:30]  Blocking everyone's  Commute  I also blame  The people driving  Who are dumb  You can get away  With almost murder  During  UN General Assembly  Week  On the roads  Go through red lights  If you see  There are cops  Everywhere  They're not gonna  Fucking give you a ticket  They're very busy  So  If there's a cop  A cop behind you  With his lights on  Did you say  A cop behind you  No cop  It was close to  A cop behind you  There's a cop 
[01:23:00]  Behind you  A cop  Okay  And  There's no way  For you to get over  So he can go around you  And you're the one  That's at the red light  And you're hearing  Don't be afraid  To  To slowly look  And go through the light  He's not gonna trick you  And then when you get  On the other side  Pull you over  And give you a ticket  For a red fucking light  While Ahmed Dijan  Is waiting in his truck  Exactly  He's not trying to fool you 
[01:23:30]  Go through the fucking thing  You dumb cocksucker  You sure?  I'm positive  Because I really wasn't  I'll pay the ticket  I really wasn't sure  What to do there  In that situation  Oh my god  I was confused  What dummies  I look at  When the cop  Because there's cops  With lights on  Everywhere  This week  And these morons  Don't know how to fuck  To go through a red light  When a cop's behind them  They're not there  To trick you  They're there to get  Some fucking  Savage  Who's enjoying  The city's  Comforts  Through the red light  We could take care 
[01:24:00]  Of the Iranian problem  We could take care  Of a lot of problems  This week  Could be handled  If we had an ounce  Of balls  Balls  I shouldn't say  We don't have balls  Instead  They get put up  At wonderful hotels  Enjoy the fruits  Of a free nation  And a wonderful  Huge city  And they fund terrorism  Half these guys  Fund terrorism  To kill our citizens  And then come here  And fucking enjoy  Being in the UN  We're dumb  They love it  We're dumb  This is a party week  For them  That's like if a guy 
[01:24:30]  Was fucking your chick  And you said  Come over  And let him stay  In your house  We're dummies  Stay over  Actually stay  In the real good place  Too  In the good room  Then they go back  And continue  Their shenanigans  Of paying people  To plan on killing  Americans  But you know  Bloomberg  Talks about  It's all about the money  Thank god the UN's here  Put the UN in the middle  Of a fucking cornfield  In Iowa  And then when everyone  Gets there  Tell our diplomats  To steer clear  And then just

[01:38:00]  Hi Mike  I would have nothing funny to say  But she had a great line  Well I picked out a security guard  Before and talked to him  And I was like  I'm really going after Tyson  They cut a lot of my stuff  You know  But I was like  Please be ready  To clothesline him  If he comes at me  Yeah  So yeah  Well that's pretty good  If you could actually  Convince anybody  To go after Tyson  If he gets a little  Rambunctious  Yeah  But he was cool  I thought he was  But he had a chair  And a whip  The security guard  He was just like  Here hold this  You might need it  A couple tasers 
[01:38:30]  Yeah  And Tyson was a boy  A trank gun  Yeah  He was like  Heckling me  And I was like  I cannot believe  What a surreal moment  Yeah Mike Tyson  Yelling at you  Spitting all over the day  It was great  Because as you were going off  You could hear Patrice  Even saying like  What the fuck is shit  He knows me though  I don't know why  He was acting so surprised  I know  But he was just like  Oh my  Motherfucker  This bitch is going on  That's Patrice's thing though  Because he did that  At the moment  He was attacking him  At some mercy  He's like  Who the fuck 
[01:39:00]  That was really funny  It was funny as fuck  His reactions were amazing  Yeah  But yeah it's a roast  Oh you know what  I went to  WhatWouldTylerDurndo.com  And they're asking  Did Amy Schumer go too far  Oh  On a date  Oh no  You gotta read  Wait a minute  Always  What's a date  This is dating business  Yeah no  Did you  What Would Tyler Durndo  Do  That article's really funny  We like him  Yeah he said nice things about me  Yeah he gets it  Oh that's cool  Wtdd.com 
[01:39:30]  It's amazing to me  There's any controversy  Like first of all  A jack  Look you know  Ryan's a nice guy  But a jackass star  Drunk drives and is killed  And it's sad  Yeah  You reference it  And you're making fun of Steve-O  It wasn't even a joke about Ryan  It wasn't about Ryan Dunn  Right  These fucking babies on Twitter  Ugh  Yeah  Ugh it annoyed me  So fucking much  But it got Amy Schumer  Trending for a while  It did  I was trending  You were trending  Yeah it's  God it's just been really weird  Cause that joke didn't 
[01:40:00]  Especially stand out that night  The crowd didn't react weird  Yeah  I didn't think about it  And I you know  That's why  And the joke itself  Isn't a bad joke  No  It's like a typical roast joke  Like I wish you were dead  Instead of this person  Yes  That  And actually  I've seen some roasts  Since Geraldo's died  Where people have made  Geraldo jokes  Absolutely  In the same thing  Yeah  Yeah  In this roast  Or Amy Winehouse  And oh  I'm the worst person up there 
[01:40:30]  It was all like  Ex-cons and rapists  And they're like  Let's pick out  The little blonde girl  But I don't know  It's like  People have either been  Really like  Fighting for me online  Or just going for  The jugular with me  And I welcome it  It's good for you  If you had  An ounce challenge  Ounce  You've never  Knossed anyone  O-W-N  Seriously  I haven't been called a cunt  This much for a while  But it feels good  You actually read that?  Somebody said  Yeah  Because I said something  About like 
[01:41:00]  Don't be such fucking babies  And then someone  Wrote me  You know  If you ever  Lost someone  I have  Yeah  Asshole  Oh I've lived  A pain free life  Of course  Jimmy's lost a lot  Way too many  Fuck them  Yeah we're suspicious  Of Jimmy at this point  He's lost so many close ones  A jackass star  Dying in a drunk driving accident  Is a fucking fodder  And a roast  I'm sorry  It is  Any of it is  Charlie Sheen's kids  Being taken away  Is a sad thing  But it's fodder  And a roast  Of course  I've never had to deal  With death  Until of course 
[01:41:30]  Spock  Fixed the Enterprise  And gave himself  Radiation poisoning  When Khan was going to  Blow up the Genesis device  But after having to  Deal with death  That way  Yeah it was  Then I felt it  So before then  I was just happy-go-lucky  Skipping through space  With my shoelaces untied  I didn't even think about  The possibility  That that would be  The thing that offended people  Yeah  And also they're  You know they're like  How would you feel  I'm like  I've dealt with so much loss  You know I've talked about  My dad on here a lot  I'm like  I've cleaned my own father's shit 
[01:42:00]  Oh Jesus  Who did that  Thank you  Thank you  Now  Now Opie's being  Inappropriate  Come on  Hold on  I have to tweet  Opie  You son of a bitch  Thank you  Why are you saying that  About Amy's  Thank you  My dad once lost it  In my car  And I said  Fucking clean it up man  I'm not clean that shit up  Now clean it up  I'm not clean that shit up  You're not worth enough money 
[01:42:30]  For me to  Clean that up  But nothing's off limits  I feel like  You know  I'm used to  Only spending time  With people  Where we're trying  To hurt each other's feelings  Trying to make each other  Feel horrible  Thus making yourself  Feel better  People are saying  Mean shit about me  All night  Well that's the difference  Between Comedy Central  So they're putting  A lot of people  Who are not  Comedians roasting each other  Kind of understand something  Because comics are brutal  To each other  You know  I mean  They get that  But when you have  Non-comics  They're the ones  Who are going to get offended  Much faster than the comedians 
[01:43:00]  Because they're not used  To interacting that way  Steve-O's supposed to be  A comedian though  Yeah now he is  He's been on the road  For I don't know  A year or something  So I hope  He hasn't  He hasn't said anything  But I hope  He's cool about it  And knows that it was just  It's a joke  He's a comic  He didn't say anything  After the taping  He was at the hospital  With his nose  With a broken nose  He ran into Mike Tyson's fist  So uncomfortable  What a lunatic  And did he start like  Bleeding profusely  From the mouth and nose  I think  I walked off the stage  But I think so  Wait what happened 
[01:43:30]  What happened  Well during one point  Of the roast  He had ran into  He made Mike Tyson  Like hold his fist out  And ran into Mike Tyson's fist  With his face  And the first time  Was okay I guess  And then he did it again  At the end of the roast  When the credits were rolling  And fucking face first  And just went  Yeah I think it's broken  I think it's broken  And just blood started  Pouring out of his face  And he had to go  To the hospital  His idea was better than mine  I tried to run into his fist  But backwards  At least it wouldn't have bled 
[01:44:00]  I was like it's for my mom  Yeah  It's for my mom  He's already ready for it  Of course  Just waiting  Hanging open  Gaping  There's already a picture  Of him in there  I was like what is this  Right on  Hey any of your jokes  Get cut  Yes  One about Patrice  That actually  That Kurt Metzger wrote  That I thought  Was hilarious  He said  Patrice you  What are these  Oh Patrice you  People don't know  You used to be a crackhead 
[01:44:30]  But with enough love  And patience  You finally learned  To tie a rag  To a stick  And wipe yourself  And they cut that  It's just so random  Right  But I loved it  And they cut me  Saying Patrice  I love your  Your suit  Jeff Ross wishes  He had that much material  God damn  That's good  That's funny too  And the Jeff Ross  Like I just said  How gross he was  I was like  Jeff Ross is gross  And I said  I said  I mean I would sit  On your face 
[01:45:00]  Just so I wouldn't  Have to look at it  That's great  They took those out  It's just funny as fuck  They took some stuff out  Yeah  God damn man  For time  For time right  Probably yeah  Just for time  The Patrice line  When you said  I just assume  You were raised by her  With the grandmother joke  Fucking  Thank you  I thought of that  Like two nights before  Something about  A gospel brunch  Yeah yeah  His grandma's asshole  His grandma's asshole  I just assume  You were raised by her  I just assume  She raised you  It's just such an aside  It's great man 
[01:45:30]  Yeah just letting you know  Just assuming she raised you  Of course  Yeah  How was yesterday for you  The day after the roast  It was very weird  I woke up  And like  Just you know  Smoked some pot  Like any other day  And then all of a sudden  Like I had no idea  The backlash  I was like whoa  And it was just  People either really  Defending me  Or just the most  Vile hatred  Yes  Yeah  People are really pissed  And I was just kind of  Like laughing at it 
[01:46:00]  Because I was so surprised  And then  I don't know  Did it become a hashtag?  Did it become a hashtag?  I was trending  That's what I said  She was trending  What was the hashtag?  Amy Schumer  Amy Schumer  And Ryan Dunn  Amy Schumer  Amy Schumer's a cunt  Yeah  There was something about her  Something about my cunt  Being rancid  I think  I think it was  Amy's rancid  Just rotting out of my body  Yeah of course  Fall out  Some mention of that  What do you have to say  To the people  That were offended  By the Ryan Dunn joke  They're Amy  Nothing 
[01:46:30]  Like nothing  I can't pretend  Like I have to answer  It was a roast  It was a joke  Of course  It wasn't even about Ryan  It was about Steve O  Yeah  So I just can't  And it's like  Why is that the precious joke  We're not allowed to touch  Right  We're talking about  Rape and murder  And  You know  But that's the  Interracial couples  Right  It was  Horrible things  Amy Winehouse stuff  And Geraldo  And other  Other recent deaths  But  Don't mention the precious  I think it's because 
[01:47:00]  People feel like  The jackass guys  Are their friends  And they feel like  I insulted  One of their friends  They're not  Everybody  They're not your friends  They do not want  To hang out with you  No  You suck to them  They don't have your back  A lot of them  Someone pointed this out to me  A lot of jackass fans  Probably just tuned in  To see Steve O  And they're not really  Roast fans  Oh god  So they might not understand  It's like  Why are they being so  Mean to each other  The way a roast really works  This is stupid  Hey let's watch Steve O  We love Steve O  And then they see  Ryan Dunby  They're not roast people 
[01:47:30]  Well I have a roast  If you're not gonna go  You know  Of course  Geraldo was my favorite  He was great  He was always great  It's almost pointless  To have them without him  Like just because  His jokes were so perfect  I always looked forward  To him coming up  And  He was up first usually  He was fucking strong  They were like  Well  But then it was like  He would go  And then nobody  Could really follow him  Yeah he was great  Yeah  He was fucking great man  He was  He's dead now  Dump dead asshole  Fucking asshole  Kidding  He's my friend  Before we get to met  I'm kidding  Stop it  But Gilbert made fun  But Gilbert made fun 
[01:48:00]  Of Geraldo's death  Yeah  And it was like  You think Geraldo  Wouldn't appreciate that  Geraldo was brutal  Yeah  He was fucking brutal  He would have been  The first one making jokes  Of course he would have  That would have looked awkward  Zombie Geraldo  Wow  Just horrified screams  From everybody  Still hilarious though  Still just fucking hilarious  His ear falls off  He's joking about it  It was weird  How far into it  Did you realize  Like oh this is going  Fucking great  Was it after the first joke 
[01:48:30]  Or was it a minute in  As soon as I said  Mike Typhon  Like when I predicted  And the crowd was like  They were surprised  Because no one knows me  I'm sitting there  I just look like  This dumb bitch  Why is she up there  What's this little  Blonde girl doing  What is she doing  And then I walk up there  You know  And just went right  For Tyson  And everyone was like  What  I think they were surprised  And then  You know  It's like anything  Where they realized  I wasn't nervous  I wasn't  They were in good hands  During my set 
[01:49:00]  So everybody just chilled out  And it was a good time  Yeah that was really good too  Because you weren't  Fucking like nervous  You could tell  I wasn't  Which  What was that  The weed  No I didn't drink  Or smoke pot  Like all leading up to that  I know  What is that like  Ever  It was awful  It's gotta be  I feel ready  To talk about this  Never wanna feel that  I went to bed sober  Every night  Oh fuck  I had dreams  It was  I had dreams  I'm not comfortable  Memories  Yeah  It was really weird  Rick Ritz  Yeah I knew 
[01:49:30]  Who I was waking up next to  I was like  What is this  That's the worst  But yeah  I wasn't nervous  And I think also  Because comedians  You know like  Jimmy when  When he's about to do  Leno or some TV set  You work  You get ready for it  And I was doing  Everything to prepare  So I felt very ready  To do myself  I did my mantra in the mirror  Like you're ready  You're ready  You're gonna do this  You can do it  Ma I gotta do this now  No I just  I kind of just shadow box  You're the boss  You're the boss  You're the boss  Raging bull 
[01:50:00]  Yeah  It's terrible  You don't do that do you  No  It's a possibility  I don't prepare at all  Like mentally  Like you just know  What you gotta do  You do the woodwork  Beforehand  You get on stage  You don't psych yourself up though  No  No  There was no  I fucking hate actors  You watch them  Just go in and talk  You fucking twat  Do they do that  Oh my god  They warm up their shit  They have to meditate 
[01:50:30]  For a second  Why do you have to meditate  Gotta get into character  What are you talking about  Jimmy  That's what you gotta do  No preparation  Think about it  No  And I've said it  Quite a few times  When I'm watching an actor  Giving an interview  And they say things like  I learned so much from her  She actually taught me  Talking about the dumb  Oh who they're playing  Character on the script  Yeah  It's like  No  It's some person  That was written down  It's not a real person  I've lived this person 
[01:51:00]  And learned so much  I feel a connection to her  Yes  Shut up  Just make your money  And go home  She'll never  Never leave me  As  You fucking read  Lines off the paper  You presumptuous  Pompish shithead  And it leaves her  As soon as she gets  The next role  Of course  She's done with that cause  You know this character  Right  Beat the shit out of the last one  That meant so much to me  Actors are just  They're douchey  When they're trying to  Make more of their craft 
[01:51:30]  It's very hard to do  But when they're trying  To make their craft  More of a contribution  Than it really is  Yeah  It's about the work  Yeah  What work  You're pretending  To be other people  It's about the work  How about a thought from you  Why am I yelling  I love actors  It's about the work  You're like  I don't get a picture  With any of them  I really am  I talk a lot of shit  When it's us  But if a real actor  Walked by  I would walk out  Mid interview  I'd just get a photo  Something phony  Would  You've done it  You said it  He's never done it  For actors  I don't even like 
[01:52:00]  I've done it  I've just walked out  And just gotten photos  With people  Another reason why  I love Amy Schumer  She thinks it's hilarious  That we have to go  To court tomorrow  Oh I know  She thinks it's hilarious  I love it  I think it's the funniest thing ever  It is hilarious  I want to go and watch  If it wasn't such a like  Pain in the ass  To do anything  Especially  Here's what I really want to do  Get my ass down  To the courthouse  During UN fucking week  It's just going to be  Such a treat  Oh my god  Sandy beat you guys  Totally 
[01:52:30]  She won  Yep  I'm thinking at this point  You know  Defaulting  No I would never let her  Win like that  Never  We'll certainly talk  By not showing up  Is that small claims  Yeah  It's small claims  It's just some dumb  Fucking thing  Please tape it  And try to be like  A real over the top lawyer  Oh I want to do that  Objection  I am representing myself  And I want to be  The over the top lawyer  From fucking  I'm the Lincoln lawyer  I want to see  How that woman  Looks in court 
[01:53:00]  Like what's her court outfit  That's what I want to know  It's going to look like  Working girl  You know  Like a briefcase  From the 70s  Erin Blechovich  She's disgusting  Fuck her  Norma Ray Guns  Oh I don't know  Chip  That's  I don't know  Awkward  Seems weird  Oh god  Yeah I wish we were  Able to record things  And shit like that  You can't film it  I don't think so  Why not  Small claims  You would think 
[01:53:30]  Just bring Sam  And hold the camera  What are they going to say  Yeah  Hold the camera Sam  They have all those court shows  Why can't we film our own shit  We're making a court show  That's right  Making a court show  You guys should wear  Judge's robes  Show up  Let them know who's boss  Right out the gate  Yeah  That would be funny  If you showed up  In judge's robes  You bring your own gavels  I want to have the powdered wig  Like an old time fucking  Ladies with a frilly shirt  Ladies and gentlemen  Do you know that would be worth  The fucking 5,000 you'd lose  That I'd instantly lose 
[01:54:00]  Both of you  The press  The Opie and Anthony  Showed up for court  In fucking old timey wigs  Old timey  And dressed like  Supreme Court judges  Reading from scrolls  So why don't we do that  I applaud  Please do this  I applaud you your honor  Why don't we do this  You need to do this  Yes we will give her the money  If she just admits  That she is indeed a monster  That would be fucking funny man  Blonde wig  The white powdered wigs 
[01:54:30]  Blonde wig  And a frilly piratey shirt  Like Seinfeld had to wear  That would be funny man  That would be good man  Don't be so confused  God  They'd probably throw us out  For disrespecting the court  Meanwhile it's like  That was the original way  You had to come into court  When did you change the rules  Right  You know  I'm actually showing respect  By being a little retro  Have we given the details  Of the case yet  Yeah we have  We've talked about it  On the air  It's a  She wants 5 G's  5 G's  For  For allegedly  Busting up her guitar 
[01:55:00]  That she continued to use  That I paid for  That Opie paid for  That day  That's why I had to bring  Kenny as a fucking witness  A witness  Oh my god  Is Kenny going as a witness  I handed over cash afterwards  And she couldn't have been  Nicer  She was calm  She was fine with it  She was absolutely fine with it  And she continued to play the guitar  In fucking Times Square  And on America's Got Talent  Do we have a recording  Of said  Oh we do  Oh god I can't believe her tits are still there  If you would watch the video please 
[01:55:30]  Without being disgusted  Well if they show the video in court  I might be in trouble  But the fact is  But it's a show  Can we hear her  It's a show  Oh my god  Look at  Look at  Here comes the perp  He looks so suspicious too  Yeah  But the fact is  Yeah  You look like  You're the posture of De Niro  In fucking  Oh yeah  What was that  Who cares  I blew it  Oh Jim  She looks like Lady Gaga  Do you see it  Oh just like her  Yeah  This would be funny in court 
[01:56:00]  To have her play  I Love Dick  Oh yeah  Yeah  You can record audio  In the courtroom I hear  Nice  Look how unenthusiastic the crew is  Yeah well that's why  I had to pump this shit up  Well I just recorded that one in Nashville  Oh we heard  Oh she was talking about  She just recorded it in Nashville  You guys invited me to go to fucking Nashville  And now I can't even play  Are we inspired  Alright well  Take her to talk  Yeah  Alright  Very good  Facilitating

[01:57:00]  Oh my god  Oh no  Look at how you look at her  This is like the Zapruder film  With retards  Look at the face  Like an artery  Little kid  That was one rugged guitar  She's made of cement  I hurt my wrist  Oh you should see  That's all I got  After slamming it that many times  A little more  You just start peeling it  Woo  She puts her money  In our guitar I guess  You found her 
[01:57:30]  Signing place  And went  Oh no  Sandy came  Oh she's pissed  She does not look happy  She did our show  Like eight times after this  Yeah  She goes let me out of here  Sandy drop something  Sandy drop something  Sandy drop something  Sandy drop something  She's got to get back to her coffin  Before the sun comes up  Let me just get the fuck out of here  Take it  It's the greatest thing she's ever said 
[01:58:00]  Let me get the fuck out of here  She's got to put something over here  She can't go  She's angry at that display  But then money was given to her  She was paid in full  Hey don't fuck  Hey leave me the fuck alone  What happened  Where are those podcasts?  Whoa what's she gonna do with the guitar case?  With a flimsy guitar case  She's swinging at Kenny  That was assault  Yeah yeah 
[01:58:30]  Well I want money for that fucking guitar man  That's two hundred dollars man  I want my fucking money for that  She said that's two hundred dollars  She said it was two hundred dollars  Oh damn  Where's five grand come from?  And where's Kenny?  I paid at least two  Yes  Kenny  I think it went Trey  Oh man  Did I go Trey?  She implicated herself right there  Two hundred dollars  She said it was two hundred dollars  Why don't we save it for the courtroom?  Jenny's nervous  Kenny  It's small claims  We have photographic evidence 
[01:59:00]  Oh we do  That's right  And we have audio evidence though  That she said it was two hundred dollars  Exactly  And do we have to play that?  Which I don't even want a judgment for two hundred  You should  We should  We gotta play that in court tomorrow?  You should  I look like a monster  Yeah you look like a monster  Listen to  Listen to  Listen to Affley Roberts  Affley Roberts  Stupid Roberts  It's supposed to be Bailey  But it's you  Oh  Fucking creep hair  Because you're barely alive  What?  I'm alive?  I know  I can't believe how long  I should have to look at her  Kenny's gonna be very good in court 
[01:59:30]  Oh yeah  Kenny's a good witness  He has creased slacks  No way  And Frankenstein's jacket  Kenny we have photographic evidence  Wait a minute  It's not even gonna go to trial  No  It's either gonna go to a mediator  Do we have photographic evidence though?  I predict this getting thrown the fuck out  Like within seconds  Of them seeing her  You know Ari Shafir is here  Oh is he?  Kenny's really worried  Yeah he is  Yeah Kenny  Very nervous  Don't you have to be a human  To sue somebody? 
[02:00:00]  Oh god  That's like an animal coming in  I'm suing you  She said her guitar is worth $200  The plaintiff  Will you stop hanging upside down  From the rafters?  We have proof she continues  Using the same guitar too right?  Kenny's technically our lawyer tomorrow  Yeah  He's not allowed to have a lawyer  What's your comment?  Comment?  Yes  The judge is gonna ask her  To remove that mask in court  Your honor  I did witness this  Right after I starched my collar again 
[02:00:30]  Stiff collars  I wanted to bring Ron the lawyer  Oh man  I would have loved Ron the lawyer  What do you do  What do you do  What do you do  Yeah  Oh she's the crypt keeper  What if she has an attorney  That cross examines Kenny  And gets Kenny to fess up  To horrible things he did  While on the job  Just brings up his past record  I don't touch him  They're just small  I like to look at them Jack  Well there was this one time 
[02:01:00]  In the project  We said he fell off the roof  Yeah  In person  I'm still within the limitation  You know  Statue of limitation  Of course  That's why  You're fine  Because you never  First of all  I'm joking  You never did anything inappropriate  That was from Fort Apache  The Bronx  Yes  Exactly  We're just talking about movies again  You like talking movies  Remember Kenny  You have an exemplary career  As a police officer  I'm an avid fan of cop movies 
[02:01:30]  That's right  Who doesn't love them  What did you say  What movies  Cop  Oh sorry  I thought it was something Amy likes  Yeah  I was like what  I woke up  Amy can I ask you something  Yeah  Because we need an open mind here  Now you've seen the evidence  The video  Oh come on  And now you're the judge  In this small claims case  What are you thinking  I think you had to do it  Nice  I think you had no choice  But to do it  I wish Sam would take her picture  Off the screen  It really is disgusting  It's haunting  Well she's  Amy's probably never seen 
[02:02:00]  What if they bring up  The YouTube video  Sandy Kane gets ritualistically abused  On OPA  Well maybe they shouldn't  Well you know what  She did everything  Of her own fucking fruition  Which one is that  Is that what her  What is this thing  He's got  He's thick in your face  That I like  Look over there  To see the  Oh no  To see if it's big  All right  Pause  Pause  It's too visual 
[02:02:30]  It's too visual  What happened Sam  Did you slap her with your dick  You have to explain the whole clip  Because no one knows  What we're talking about  All right  Well Sandy Kane was sitting there  In the middle of the studio  At 57th Street  In one of the easy chairs  So there was nothing around her  One of our beautiful chairs  There was a studio audience  That you could hear  Watching her  And they told her  To look at me  With the camera  At which point  Opie took the yogurt  Which he usually enjoys  For breakfast  All right  And just chucked it  In her face  While it was open 
[02:03:00]  Yogurt  Yogurt  In her face  You know what  Who do I make  To check out  Can I be tried  Separately  Also  I would like  Settle out of court  Maybe  I actually want to turn  State's evidence  On Opie  Can I do that  Can I roll over  On Opie over here  Because  Dirty rat  The problem is  All that only occurred  How can you prove  It's me throwing the yogurt  Sam  How can you prove  It's yogurt  All that occurred  Exactly  Only within the first  Ten seconds  Of a video called  Ritualistically Abused 
[02:03:30]  So I would assume  There's some more  If you want  There's a history of it  Sure  Let's see  Yeah  What else  This proves  She accepted it  Oh my god  Yogurt all over  Why did she come back here  I can't go  But she did  Every time  She comes back  That's why she has no case  Because she's an entertainer  She used to do this  On our cable show  She had a cable access show  She goes in the middle  Of Times Square  Fucking naked  Playing her guitar  The naked cowboy  Should see her 
[02:04:00]  And begging for money  Yeah  He lost too  Because I think they said  You can only prevent  Another person from doing it  Not a wombat  Yes  This was her role  On the show  And out of nowhere  She decided  It was not okay  Which is ridiculous  If anything  They demanded  She got an organ grinder  Yeah  Because her organs  Are all messed up  Right here  That's kind of true  Chip  Thank you for explaining  If you look at them  Is that it?  That's probably it  No

I'm jealous  I love Opie man  I had a wet dream  About him so  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh no  What was that  Being dumped on her head?  Someone's pulled her hat off  E-Rock  Her wig  That's E-Rock's body  You can tell from the stomach  E-Rock found  Oh boy  An old jar of gravy  In the fridge 
[02:06:30]  Oh my god  An old jar of gravy  I know  And there was a bubble gum  And a navel address  You'd think E-Rock was really depressed  That he had to waste gravy  Of course he was  He didn't find it  He pulled it out of his pocket  This place is like Guantanamo  E-Rock you're in trouble man  I'm bringing you up  In the court case tomorrow  She loves gravy  Alright so this gravy  She looks really happy  Which by the way  I had nothing to do with  Anthony had nothing to do with  And little Jimmy Norton  Had nothing to do with  E-Rock decided on his own  To dump the gravy on his fucking head 
[02:07:00]  Jimmy is not named  In any litigation  That's right  That's a fucker  Oh yeah  A little more  Who were you asking  Oh okay  And then he gets out of there  Anyone do that  What'd you dump on it?  The taco sauce  Now you're sobbing  No wig sauce

[02:08:30]  An Ant  Yes  Briefcase  I don't know  Yeah yeah  Briefcase  We're going briefcase tomorrow  Briefcase  Only Ant knows what that means  Or a long case  Gotta go Brady Bunch on her ass  Fishman's thinking  Ted Sheckler  Attorney at law  Might have to show up  Could you be our attorney tomorrow  Ted Sheckler  You're our Sandy  Can't know exactly  What she was doing  Supposedly  My clients  Ritualistically  Abused her  And lied to her  Did they just make her case  Wait a minute  They broke her guitar  And gave her no money  Your honor 
[02:09:00]  Five thousand is not enough  I'm sorry Gregory  Ted what are you doing  I'm just trying to tell the truth  Anthony  I just swore off  Through the court  Ted Sheckler  Attorney at law  Stinks  Worst attorney  All right  Sam that's it  Obviously  That's 131  Oh  Out of 325  Let's see what else  We'll keep going  All right  Now the  Wait a minute  The interns are picking up her chair 
[02:09:30]  Yes  So they can throw it out of the studio  With her  With her in it by the way  Oh I'm sorry  I didn't mention that  She is reclined in it  Amy  I'm a good guy  I'm not judging you  Hey  I'm a good guy  I think you guys are hilarious  I have no problem with this  Oh wombat  All right  So she's going to drag out of the studio  As you can see  She's got a parting gift  There's a massive dildo in her hand  She held on to that dildo  More than the chair  Oh god  It's like a celebration 
[02:10:00]  At a church wedding  What an exit  That sun you just heard  Was her and the chair  Being thrust onto the floor  Outside of the studio  Amy you better watch your mouth  Oh yeah  I'm not going to fuck with you guys  I do love gravy though  So I'm kind of ahead of the game  This is just fucking  Abominable  She does not have a spine  Well now that she's out of the studio  So that's got to be the end of the clip  I don't know  Because she wasn't wearing her hat  When she left the studio  Oh what happened  Kenny's finally smiling  Because he knows it's too late 
[02:10:30]  He's remembering  Banging her  Camera  It's like an airplane  Wow  Okay that's actually  Is he shitting in the corner?  Johnny Fairplay  It goes right to Johnny Fairplay  Shitting  Shitting in the corner  In the corner  I do believe this involves  Sandy's hat  Yeah  That would be star of  Survivor and reality TV shows 
[02:11:00]  Johnny Fairplay  Is he named in the litigation?  So he should be  So she should be  You know  Feel flattered  I've never seen someone  Taking so much joy in shitting  Look how happy he is  He's laughing  She left her hat behind Amy  She left her hat behind  Well she shouldn't have done that  He drove to the bathroom  Thank you  He was on Celebrity Rodeo too  So  Oh good  That's a thing?  Yeah  It's not  Sandy is cattle  It's not great  That live audience sounds  That's stupid  To have that right 
[02:11:30]  It's a little Johnny  I think the judge will see  I need toilet paper now  Johnny Fairplay  Shit in her hat  Jimmy's so helpful  He's so panicipated  There's this shit  It's a little turd  Just in case you think  We do fake radio Amy  There's the duty  There's the proof  There's the duty  That wasn't even a good one  I should have done it myself  There's a milk dud  Celebrity poo poo 
[02:12:00]  That was part of our shit stage  We went through a shit stage  You did?  Yes  From 2004 to late 2010  We're finally over it  We're sunk  Oh my god  Kenny's sitting there  Disgusting  He's really mad  Kenny's not proud of himself  Well Kenny likes to  Protect us  He's not happy  That we're going down  This road  Oh my god  He's not happy  This is hilarious  What happened with the hat  This would be worth twice the money she wants  In my fucking video 
[02:12:30]  Yes  There's still a minute left on the video  How does this only have 7,000 views?  This is where we pretend that  You do not put her hat back  I'll give you how much to put the hat on  No  I'll give you how much to put it on  I'll give you  Pause  This video should be played in court  Absolutely  I'm not even joking  Of course not  This should be fucking played in court  She's getting money  What do we do to her  If she's going to put a hat with shit on  Exactly  For a hundred  I still don't know 
[02:13:00]  She's always asking for and getting money  This just shows that she's not very good at haggling  I don't know  Is that what you get from this?  She would get murdered in Tijuana  I wouldn't  Let's bring her iPads tomorrow  We got some videos to show the judge  I don't know  Guys  I don't know  Your honor  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury  Here's the problem though  The judge has to get through  Two and a half minutes  Of ritualistically abusing Sandy Cain  Before he gets to your evidence  Well  Yeah the judge isn't going to be like  Well did you give her the hundred bucks  So that's okay  The whole thing is a set up for this  The big ending where she asks for money 
[02:13:30]  And she's not leaving  And we are not preventing her from leaving  She is enjoying herself  As a matter of fact  And enjoying the publicity  Much as she is right now in this courtroom  One hundred  Ooh that was good  Yes  You actually physically picked up the chair  And threw it out of the studio  Yes  And she came back  Basically we gave her an out  Yeah  She came back in to put the hat  To put the hat on  With the shit in it  Yes  Well what happens  Come on  This is a  On the edge of my seat here  A hundred  It'll be the fucking smartest thing  That's been under the hat 
[02:14:00]  I will shit be half a hundred bucks  So now  Fifty, eighty, a hundred  A hundred  Not be a hundred bucks  Not in my seat  Not in my seat  In my shitty hat  In my seat  Oh don't be shitty  Because the hat feels the same way  Believe me  Put it down  Put it down  Pull it down  There you go  Twenty dollars  Hey  I am disgusted 
[02:14:30]  She walked out of there  With no clothes  Her wig taken off  Gravy and yogurt  Throne on her  Physically thrown out of the studio  And shit on her head  And money 
[02:15:00]  And a hundred bucks  Yes  That made the pinball scene  And the accused look romantic  It wasn't it?  Yes  Wait a minute  What are you talking about?  The love scene  Oh god  That was really a lot  So we have a case, right?  Yo, you guys are gonna win  I think we're golden here  This is  It's like watching this Bruder film  This is like  With shit in her head  The hat went back  Into the left  This is like Gary Glitter  Being accused  And pulling out  Other videos  Of him fucking kids 
[02:15:30]  Which they didn't see  Previously  And saying  Do you see, your honor  They showed up  Knowing what I was gonna do  Yeah  That just made me sad  That's one magic turd  You mean to tell me  The turd went through her hat  Out  Hit her in the wrist  As you see  When the yogurt  Hit her face  Ricochet it off  Yes  The first shot  Of yogurt  Knocking her wig  To the floor  There's nice videos  Of her online 
[02:16:00]  That's her hat  That's the second hat  Oh, that's part of the case  Which I took to the range  And shot with a .50 caliber  Yeah, it has a bullet hole  Yes  That's part of the case, Amy  Yes  That's gonna be evidence tomorrow  Contrary to popular belief  Her head was not in the hat  At the time  So she doesn't have a case there  There's only a couple  Bullet holes in there, right?

Yes  By the way  Before you tell us  What you have to say  She has to prove her case  By the preponderance  Of the evidence  Right  Ooh, preponderance  By the way  That's what Twano's voice  Would sound like  I just sit here  On her vagina  Kenny doesn't want to laugh  But that smile  Is getting bigger  Yeah, he's smirking  So she has to come in  And prove her case 
[02:23:30]  Right  She has to prove  That we  Did something to her  That is worth  Five thousand dollars  Right  Before you guys  Say anything  Don't say anything  She has to prove her case  Right  And then we get to speak  And try to  Discredit what she has said  If it goes that far  Then you will have  The opportunity  Right  If she speaks  Then we should be able  To speak  And Anthony  With that  Let me handle this  I will speak  For me and you  No  I will speak

We're just watching  Captain Queeg  Fiddle with the microphone thing  He really is  He's not happy  That we decided  To go with this  Well you know what it is  Usually a lawyer  Would tell his client  To keep everything  On the QT  Until the case  Is actually in court  Right?  So that's why  You're kind of  You know  A little nervous about this 
[02:27:30]  Wait how long ago  Did Bob call you  And tell you the dates?  I don't know  About anywhere between  Two weeks and  Three weeks ago  Like he didn't call you  Yesterday to remind you?  No  No  They used to be in court  Why would he do any of that?  No  Bob  What the fuck are you doing?  He gets his money  How does the agent  Not call and say that?  He did a lot of preparation  For this also  I assume  Oh yeah  I assumed  I'm being facetious  Oh  Well do that in court  That sounds  That sounds  Like important  Has she got any sort of case at all?  I don't think so 
[02:28:00]  Is it just complete suing  For the sake of it  I'm looking like  This is her suing  Because the lawsuit  That she had  With the naked cowboy  Which she won  Was a publicity engine for her  She made the paper  Oh  So she wants more  So now she sees  Ah  I got some news out of that  Let me now  Sue somebody  Get another court thing going  So I can get more publicity  Which will get more  Tourists  Walking up to her  In Times Square  And laughing at her  I've seen her in Times Square

[02:29:00]  This shit was working for her  To do these dumb appearances  It really is too easy to sue  And legally you have to respond  To someone who's suing you  Yeah  Or else you're in default  Somebody sued me once for  I think 800 million dollars  Oh yeah  That's nice  Because I was representing  Some homeless guy in court  Did you pay?  Right  No I didn't  But I had to respond  Like I had to literally  Hire a lawyer  Yeah yeah  And write up forms  That's why  I'm not hiring any lawyer  This thing could cost me a dime  I'm gonna go in  I'm gonna go  I'm gonna wow the courtroom  That's right  I'm just gonna show that judge  You're gonna charm him  Right in  I'm gonna charm him 
[02:29:30]  I've watched enough movies  Where I know  Especially if  Like I said  A big fat black sassy judge  No need  I know  You just gotta  You gotta be like  Let me tell you something  You look  Fly today girl  And she'll be like  Bring back the word fly  Oh yeah  I'll bring that word back  I wanna see this unfold  So bad  That's cause she'll  Like she's old school  So I gotta go with that  And she's gonna like  She's gonna grab the robe  At the top  Her judge robe  And close it to him  And go  Oh now I have the name of you

[02:35:30]  On iTunes  And the World Wide Web  And the World Wide Web  Yeah  That's good  Yeah that interwebs  Interwebs is really taking off  It's amazing  You guys want to talk to Sam's mom?  What's with the lib shirt?  Black History Month  I cannot believe you wore that here  I was like  There's a picture of Martin Luther King  Malcolm X  That's Sam's nightmare on your shirt  Obama  And Frederick Douglass  Wow  How about one of these things  Is not like the others?  I'm surprised you  You recognize these men  Oh believe me  I have  I was going to say 
[02:36:00]  Dark Ports  You know I just noticed  No  Their faces are all in white  Yeah yeah  That's what you guys need  For court tomorrow  You need to wear blackface  Blackface?  Yes  Powdered wings and blackface  Mommy  Mommy  We'll just do an old  Minstrel show  Take Ari's shirt  Yeah  And now  Put that in a nice little list  The one you hate the most  To the one you hate the least  Well  Let me see  Hate the least start  Start at hate the least  Well I don't hate any of them 
[02:36:30]  Well dislike  Because that is terrible  People that I dislike  Let me see  I guess I would have to at this point  Go with Obama  Because he's really trying so hard  To take what is left of my money  In more taxes  That he insists I'm not paying  You dislike him the most?  Which I would love to  Yes  Out of all four  Well Frederick Douglass  Well you blew the list  None of them have done anything to  Now Frederick Douglass  I call what I call a Budinsky  With that whole abolitionist thing  Stop learning to read 
[02:37:00]  Mind your own business  Yeah just a Budinsky  Other than Obama  These are all just like  To me street names  When I know I'm in the wrong neighborhood  I'm like I shouldn't be here  And I mentioned there will be an Obama  If you're at Malcolm X  The corner of Malcolm X  And Frederick Douglass  Get the fuck out of there  Nice  What's the list?  So Obama's on top of the list  As far as most disliked  Yeah I'd put him at number one 
[02:37:30]  Disliked right now anyway  Alright who's number two  Disliked  It's kind of hard to judge history  Through you know  Ari's shirt  About a hundred and some odd years  With Frederick Douglass  But yeah  Yeah and then I would have to go  With probably Malcolm X  Malcolm  Didn't have that whole  Peace thing going on  Like  That's why you should love him  Why?  Because he was the fucking  Most honest of those guys  He was great  Yeah  Yeah  He was like fuck whites  I get that  He was like fuck whitey  You know give us guns  We want our own state 
[02:38:00]  Yeah I don't like that  He was ballsy man  He was ballsy man  The fuck whitey part of it  I love Malcolm X  No I would have to go with Malcolm X  And then like  Martin Luther King  Would be the third disliked  Nobody has a problem  With Frederick Douglass  Yeah yeah  Not really  But Martin Luther King  Martin Luther King  Has been  Over the years  Almost risen to the point  Of sainthood  When  In reality  You know  I mean everybody  Makes some mistakes  He's made a few  But people tend to 
[02:38:30]  Just tuck those away  In life  Much like they have  With Reverend Al Sharpton  Let's hope so  And then Frederick Douglass  You know  Come on  The guy's right there  Out of slavery  And fighting the good fight  Who's Uncle Tom?  Was that a guy?  For the black man  What did he do?  Uncle Tom?  That's Earl Douglass  He used to work for us  At NEW  I think he helped slaves  Do something actually  He gets a bad rap  But I think he helped  Slaves do something  Like  Uncle Tom 
[02:39:00]  Yeah  Yeah  What did he learn to read  So everybody shit on him?  I don't know  I don't know  The nerve  Sell out  Sell out  With putting those letters  And making words  You know what a conjunction is  Idiot  I learned from the Jeffersons  What he did  I remember  I don't remember what it was  From the show  The Jeffersons?  Yes  That's great  That's a great historical show  I would be honored  To be called Uncle Tom  Like it was one of those  Like  One of those moments where  It ended stark 
[02:39:30]  And no music  And the credits just ran  Oh and they do that  On very special episodes  Of like All in the Family  To the end  Dudley getting out  Of that fucking tub  And everyone's TV  Was so fucked up  That the letters  Would make your TV go  Bop  Bop  Bop  I remember I had  Like a bad TV  So when they put  White text on  It would make noise  On the TV  And when they wouldn't  Have like the  You know  Keeping your head  Above water  They wouldn't have  The music playing  You'd just hear this  Bop  And you'd be all depressed  Cause like JJ got shot 
[02:40:00]  And you don't know  If he's gonna live  The next week  To say dynamite  I just saw an episode  Of where Dudley  Got molested  Fucking hot  That one's hilarious  So over the top  We've done hours  On that episode  It really is over the top  A lot of times  Kids will think  This is their fault  But it's not their fault  Don't think this is your fault  Is that true  It's so  Oh we've done hours  I think it is actually  Their fault  Yeah  Is their fault  Yeah you wanna watch  Racy cartoons  What do you expect  Oh it is  Exactly  There's a song about it  You are never to blame

How do you know?  Not they're on a tree though  She took them a carry-on  Brought them home  Yeah she brought them home  Hold on guys  Hold on please  Oh  Bobby 
[02:59:30]  Yeah  You're out  You're out  Paul's mom just made his key lime pie  And I'm proud to say  You're out  You're yesterday's news  Oh man  Who said that?  Opie  She sounds so nice  She is the nicest woman in the world  We gave you an opportunity  And you chose to squander it  You squandered it  I'm making you wait  That's all  Well it's  I can wait all I want now  Because Paul's mom feeds us key lime pie 
[03:00:00]  She flew down to Florida  And got the key limes  Mom they're eating some really shitty key lime pies  Whoa  So I mean  It's delicious  They want what's like right now  Instead of waiting for something  That's actually good  You know?  You mean fantastic  Not shitty  Ah  No I meant shitty  You have to build up to these things  Hey Bobby  I guess yeah  These are like  Hold on Sam  Bobby listen to this  Okay  Ah  That's whipped cream  That's whipped cream going on my fresh key lime pie  They need to put a lot of whipped cream on it  Because  You are  Whoa 
[03:00:30]  Dog shit  Oh damn man  Wow  That's harsh  Don't mess with the Roberts  That's harsh  They protect each other  We stick together  I did like her apple pie  It's better than this shit  That was amazing  The apple pie  You know what Sam  You're so right  This is so shitty  I want another one  Oh man  Can I have another one?  Sure  I like how it came in its own carrying case and everything  I didn't know key limes were a thing until right now  Until you just mentioned that  Isn't that weird?  Ari how good is this shit?  I haven't tried it yet  I've been waiting to put the whipped cream on it  Key limes  You want the whipped cream?  I like to pray to God first 
[03:01:00]  It doesn't really need the whipped cream  It's very good  What are we celebrating?  Nothing  Wait  Where'd your mom get the pie crust?  I don't know  Yeah my mom makes pie crust from scratch  We wouldn't know Sam  Because she doesn't fucking do this for us  It's good right?  I've never seen one of those  Ari here  It's delicious  He's got some  Regular whipped cream  Those are store bought pie crusts  That's what you're eating right now  Oh my god  Bobby's laughing  Because it's a joke  For somebody to bring in a pie with a store bought pie crust  Why are you laughing Bobby?  I can't even believe somebody uses a store bought pie crust 
[03:01:30]  Oh my god  Oh man  I told you  What a judgmental family  Battle of the moms  Look out  Wow this is crazy  This could be a reality show  Yeah  You're telling me this pie came all the way from Florida  It didn't  It's bullshit  Key limes did  She flew down just to get the key limes  For our key lime prime  Right from where Iraq was born and raised  That's right  Close I hear  She flew down and got the limes  Brought them back up here  And made the pie  That's right  So what are you guys doing for her? 
[03:02:00]  Nothing  Really nothing  We don't need to do anything for her  Doing it out of the kindness of her heart  We're that damn good  The pies might as well have a hostess label on them  They're nonsense  Oh shit  Oh shit  Okay  Paul you gonna take that shit from Sam?  Paul punch him in the face  If your mom wasn't slacking  My mother wouldn't have had to make them yesterday  Oh shit  Mom were you slacking?  Okay I'm making the pie  Okay  You see what you do  You see what you do to people?  She doesn't want to miss  She's got better things to do  Than make a pie for you  Doesn't she what compliment you?  No you're horrible people  Who say nasty things about her  Mother  Don't say nasty stuff 
[03:02:30]  We didn't say anything back  Well you said  Why don't you tell us what we said  I don't remember  Yeah go ahead  Well Ant you said  What did I say?  You said she was scissoring  With her female friends  At the women's club  Look  Why is that negative?  That sounds like a great time  It's not like  Jim really  You said she comes back  Amy wants an application  By the way  To your women's club  Where's this party going on?  Jim said that  Is there more pie?  She comes back  Yeah  From her meetings  With butt cheeks  That smell like cocoa butter  And look  I skate  I didn't say anything bad  Opie you started the whole thing  By asking if she lezzes out 
[03:03:00]  That's a fair question  Lezzes out  Well for Amy  He's a journalist  He's a journalist  Amy  Amy  Amy I gotta explain it to you  Okay  We found out that Bobby  Like every afternoon  Goes to some kind of  Women's club  It's a women's club  So what would you  Not every afternoon  Every afternoon  I don't know when she goes  But her own Sam  Her own son  Her own beloved Sam  Couldn't tell us  What goes on  At this women's club  Not one thing  Could he tell us  So we had to assume  Of course  And Bobby 
[03:03:30]  How long have you been  Going to the women's club?  Oh I don't know  Probably three or four years  Three or four years  Three or four years  In that three or four years  You've never discussed  One iota  Of this with your son Sam  That you have a great  Relative  But it's not every afternoon  It's like two or three  Meetings a month maybe  Oh well  Do you wear a red hat?  No hat  It can't be every week  No hats  You know I've got to lie  They've got to leave  One week out  That's her legs  Or over some chick's shoulders  Oh come on Amy  That's when they were  Red pants  I'm sorry about that 
[03:04:00]  I'm sorry Bobby  You missed what Amy said  About the hats  The hats?  There's a reason why  They're not wearing hats  But maybe you're not  Allowed to say it again  Amy  You can't wear a big hat  If your legs  Over somebody's shoulders  That is true  It looks silly  Now Bobby  What are you doing  At this club?  What happens?  We're a little concerned  Okay well  Let me just tell you this  I was out yesterday morning  So I missed the original show 
[03:04:30]  I did hear the replay last night  And you guys were so disgusting  Warente Bobby  I was mortified  Just sitting here  I think she's probably right  Which lines bothered you?  Yeah we need to know  So we can learn  Yeah but we're not going to learn  If you're vague  We don't know what bothered  What was disgusting  Mom I told them  That you didn't like  That dad was laughing  At the line about you  Masturbating under an afghan  I told them  I think that was Jimmy's  You have an afghan? 
[03:05:00]  It's a person  Not even a thing of clothing  It's actually a member  Of the Taliban  On me as I masturbate  We were listening to that last night  While we were trying to have dinner  Sam and Jess were here  Jess and I were just rolling our eyes  At each other  And blocking it out  Stop being so obsessed with our show  Turn off the radio  And have a nice meal  Why don't you stand up for yourself  As I turn it off  I wanted to hear what you said  Oh  So Sam's dad is sitting here 
[03:05:30]  Cracking up  He's a good boy  Psychopath  Does Jess want to join  The women's club?  No  No  Why?  Why?  Look at you  You're saying like  No  Like no  I don't want to  Bring her into this debauchery  No  The women's club  That's totally the wrong idea  We are a philanthropic organization  Ah  Oh yeah  Well whatever you're feeling  Yeah  Lick my anthropic  Here we're doing charity work 
[03:06:00]  Put your legs here  Yeah  I was like  I didn't mean that stuff  I said about  Like the stuff they teach you  I was literally  Something about a rolling pin  I think  Oh no  I don't remember the rolling pin line  I was joking  But I said something  About how they teach each other  How to masturbate  By grinding against the end  Of the kitchen table  What was the name of the towel  That they used?  The whoopsie  The whoopsie  Do you have a whoopsie towel?  Bobby  The whoopsie towel  That was only  Oh get a load of this  That was only  If there was one 
[03:06:30]  If there was massage going on  And one gal  Used her thumb  And pointer finger  To open the anus  Of the other gal  Okay  Okay  Inserted  Our anus  And inserted a finger  Sometimes accidents happen  And you have to get  The whoopsie towel  That's why the whoopsie towel  Is useful  You are never to blame  Right  Now Bobby  Don't worry  What do you do at this club?  Like what kind of events go on?  You know what's really funny?  Is you guys  You guys should meet  The members of this club  Oh 
[03:07:00]  Oh  Well  That sounds like an invitation  To me  Why?  My mom is the press director  Of the club  Press director  That's right  The average age is 82  You're sick Bobby  What are you?  You're the chippy?  Yeah  She makes the old ladies  Worship her feet  Yeah  All right  Bobby's into 82 year olds  Sam  Yeah  Bobby left her chopper upstairs  And she's down in the basement  Of the women's club  With the gimp  Now what do you guys do? 
[03:07:30]  What kind of events?  What are you doing  My mom  Yeah  What events do you do?  Philanthropic  How long are you going to play this?  We get it  Now what  Yeah  What do you do  For charity?  We have little  Fundraisers  She's trying to make up stuff  Year  We give money  To like the humane society  Oh  Peanut butter  You know  We give a  We give 
[03:08:00]  We give a scholarship  To a  Girl  Graduated  Of course  Of course a girl  It's a women's club  What does the girl have to do  To get the scholarship?  She has to be black  They have a guest colleague  Come in once every month  Can we please just find  A little dignity  Some place  Not here  I've looked all over this place  Look and look  Yeah  You're never going to find dignity  Or pride  Or anything else good  That was my stripper name 
[03:08:30]  It did not work out  Dignity  That would be hilarious  What's your name?  Dignity  Dignity  Why hasn't someone done that yet?  That's fucking weird  Because it's a little too clever  For a fucking whore  Oh good point  Although you didn't come up with it  I figured it  Come on  Not for this fucking whore  Well that's true  Bobby we're very suspicious  Of this women's club  We're going to be  Keeping our eyes on this thing  Well we had a guy  Come in last week  Oh  Told you Sam  A fake police officer 
[03:09:00]  We told you  Was he a fake cop  Or a construction worker?  What was he?  Bobby we told your son Sam  That guys were showing up  At this club  Who's illegally parked outside  And then he rips his pants off  Giant pop  Kenny all of a sudden  Comes in  Oh god  You guys could come in  And do that  Life of the party  All the girls are licking whipped cream  I think Sandy Kane  Is guest lecturing now  Yes  That's true  You can go to the  Monsters club  You can tell you  How to grow a huge goiter  On your  Do you guys got a budget  For whipped cream?  You must go through  A lot of whipped cream 
[03:09:30]  And bath towels  Whoopsie towels  Whoopsie towels  Last week we had a meeting  A guy came in  And showed us flower arranging  Flower arranging  Is that what they're calling it now?  Yeah  I've heard it called an orchid  Or a rosebud  How to keep them from falling out  When you sneeze  A lot of tulips and orchids  Oh shit  She meant that  She meant that literally  What?  Flower arrangements  Flower arrangements  Right  That was not a euphemism  That's right 
[03:10:00]  And not a euphemism  Oh  That's not how to open  Someone's rose petals  No  How do they do it  With the index finger?  Well  When the older woman  Is massaging  Okay  She'll part the buttocks  Of the woman  With her pointer finger  And thumb  And sometimes the nail  Digs into the tender ass skin  Sure  Sure  It's like forcing  Someone's eye open  Oh well  There I go  Flower arrangements 
[03:10:30]  For Bobby  So a guy came in  And did this?  Well  Was he  Did he  Did he do side work  As a roofer  Or something?  I bet not  No  Yeah  Was he a little  Effeminate?  Not really  She jiggled so hard  You guys are all  Calling him an F  Was he like  Your own Sam  Let's say  You know  Oh he was  Nothing like Sam  Oh  Okay  He's straight  What do you got 
[03:11:00]  What do you got  Planned for the future?  Besides baking us  Key lime  She's not baking you shit  Paul this shit  Was good man  I'm kidding  It was awesome  Thanks to your mom  Wow  You guys are just being polite  What does that mean?  We don't remember  How your cooking is anymore  A lot better than that  Dog shit in front of you  Delicious dog  Jesus  He really does  Love when Sam sticks up for it  Everyone else cooking  Stick together  Bobby's sick 
[03:11:30]  Bobby after they teach you  About the flower arrangements  Do you and the 82 year old  Ladies ever just say  That was boring as fuck  We all gather around him  And thank him profusely  I've seen that video  Let's be honest  The 82 year olds  Want to be doing  A little more than that  At their club  Right?  I'm not on my knees  My hips just broke  What do you got going on  At the women's club?  What's the next big event? 
[03:12:00]  Well let's see  In a couple of weeks  We have an afternoon  Dessert bridge  Ew  A dessert bridge  Go ahead Chip  All right Chip  Sounds like you're eating  A bridge or something  Yeah  Made out of desserts  Oh got it  Perfect Chip  You should teach these old bags  How to keep their uteruses  Inside their bodies  Jesus Christ  Oh my god  He didn't even consider  Not saying that  It's terrible  I've never heard that word  Used in a cop 
[03:12:30]  No  They don't have those  Vaginal meshes  Jesus  That the lawyers  Are always saying  You know if you've had one  Yeah  Pain during intercourse  Or if it falls out  Something like that  Getting back to dignity  Oh right  I thought we were  I thought we were  Keeping it within  You know the lines here  I thought it was like  Is that what you thought?  Yeah I thought so  What's a dessert bridge?  Oh yeah  What is a dessert bridge?  They all make a bridge  With their bodies  Because of the osteoporosis?  What?  I haven't been 
[03:13:00]  Bent over  Yes  They look like  They look like  The goffles  One of them gets  On her hands and knees  And they line up  Little chocolates  From her neck  All the way down  To her delicious anus  Again with the anus  Again with the anus  Oh my god  Anus  That's how you make  A chocolate fountain  Right there  Oh god  That's nice  I like dessert bridges  Bobby what's the dessert bridge?  Yeah  Because we gotta keep it dignified  They play bridge all afternoon  And they have dessert  That's all  Oh that makes more sense  Than what we were thinking  Yeah 
[03:13:30]  That's crazy  That makes a lot more sense  Yeah that actually does make sense  How many dessert bridges  Have been ruined  Because Edda had a stroke  In the middle of the card game  Oh god  Oh god  All of a sudden  You hear a piece of chocolate cake  Hit the floor  Bingo  They're playing bridge  Either Edda got bingo  Or half her body  Is shut down  They think they're playing clue  They're like  It was Colonel Mustard  They're like no  Bobby  They actually remember  A Colonel Mustard  In the old  Colonization days of England
