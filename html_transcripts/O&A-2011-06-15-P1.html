<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Larry King's introduction, immediately followed by Opie and Anthony's self-deprecating discussion of their careers and a recent disastrous comedy performance featuring Esther Koo, an Asian comedian. They harshly criticized Koo's backup band, specifically one member's body odor, then moved on to speculate about Koo's personal life, alleged daily marijuana use, and her association with Central Park hippies.  The hosts contrasted Koo's poor reception with that of a hypothetical less-attractive male comedian, segueing into a discussion of anime pornography and Opie's ex-girlfriend's fondness for it.

The conversation then pivoted to Anthony Weiner's scandal, with Opie and Anthony offering cynical speculation on the psychological impact of his name and the political fallout.  They extended this cynicism to other figures like Plaxico Burress and Michael Vick, suggesting their post-controversy activism was merely strategic image rehabilitation.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to the Casey Anthony trial. Opie detailed his Twitter interactions, specifically targeting Orlando residents with insulting remarks using the hashtag #CaseyAnthony.  They dissected the trial, offering opinions on the prosecution's case and Casey Anthony's demeanor, particularly her laughter. They predicted an acquittal on the murder charge but anticipated possible convictions on lesser offenses.

The show then shifted to a critique of Gene Simmons and Shannon Tweed's reality show, "Gene Simmons Family Jewels," which the hosts labeled as heavily scripted and fake.  They mocked various reality TV shows for their perceived inauthenticity, specifically targeting Gene Simmons' persona and the validity of his and Shannon's televised relationship struggles.  Their criticism extended to Simmons' hair.  This segment also included a discussion of the perceived breakup of Gene Simmons and Shannon Tweed, fueled by a contentious clip from their appearance on the Joy Behar show, where Tweed called Simmons "a pig" and seemingly walked off set.  The hosts believed this was a publicity stunt. A caller, Tom from Buffalo, confirmed a similarly scathing interview with Chelsea Handler.  They played the Joy Behar clip, highlighting Tweed's limited responses and Simmons' attempts at damage control.

Comedian Patrice O'Neal joined the show in studio. The conversation transitioned to the NBA Finals, LeBron James' perceived lack of "meanness," and a comparison to other basketball greats. This led to a discussion of Tracy Morgan's controversial statements and the power dynamics in show business, described by O'Neal as a "cartel."  O'Neal, using strong and offensive language, discussed the unwritten rules of Hollywood, the impact of political correctness on humor, and the consequences of challenging powerful figures. He shared anecdotes illustrating the dangers of crossing powerful individuals and the price of fame. This segment also included O'Neal's commentary on the Casey Anthony trial, the film *The Hangover 2*,  LeBron James' move to Miami, and his own frustrations with the comedy industry, including his difficulties in gaining prominence due to his unwillingness to compromise his outspoken nature. He frequently used racial and homophobic slurs.  The segment concluded with promotion of O'Neal's upcoming stand-up performance, a brief musical interlude with Warren Haynes, and a story about Arnold Schwarzenegger and his mother.

The show continued with discussions of rumors surrounding LeBron James and Jason Terry, including allegations of disparaging remarks about James's mother and a connection to a shooting incident, and a rumor about Shaquille O’Neal having a sex tape and allegedly assaulting someone who claimed to possess it.  The hosts speculated on the size of Shaq’s penis. The conversation then shifted to online videos of violent fights involving women, followed by reminiscing about the O.J. Simpson trial, particularly the glove-fitting scene and Marcia Clark. They speculated on the motivations and careers of the trial's key players sixteen years later.  Further discussions included Mark Cuban paying for the Mavericks' victory parade, tipping practices in the service industry,  a comedian's unsuccessful joke to the Dalai Lama, and a final anecdote about Bob Kelly walking past their studio.  They also briefly discussed Twitter and the challenges of using it. Steve Blatter briefly appeared to clarify a previous discussion, having been previously attacked by the hosts over a fake news story.

The final segment began with a discussion of Twitter's character limits and retweets.  It then shifted to Roland Martin's commentary on the Tracy Morgan situation, mentioning a quote from Opie's book. The conversation moved to Magic Johnson's HIV diagnosis and potential conspiracies surrounding a possible cure, and then to 9/11 conspiracy theories, with Opie expressing skepticism and another participant open to the possibility of government manipulation.  The segment concluded with scheduling banter and promotional remarks.  No guests were present in studio for this final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM's Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Oh, poor Jimmy.  Morning, everyone.  Morganing this old gag.  Yes, it truly is.  Ow.  It truly is an old gag.  But it's our old gag.  And damn it, we're here for it.  I miss the old days where every three to four years we just blow it up. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Because then it makes everything new and different for a while.  Yeah.  Like right when we started saying this old gag, we'd wind up blowing it up.  Yeah.  But now it literally is this old gag.  It's an old gag.  We just sit here day in and day out.  This old gag.  We would get bored and then we would do something crazy, get the media talking about us, and  then we would just change it up.  And have to move on.  I tried hard yesterday with the Asian jokes, but I guess I got to do another show. 
[00:01:30]  I'm in the FU stage of my career.  Yeah.  I was flexing those muscles yesterday.  Not even a bite on the internet.  Fuck.  Nah.  Nah.  It does what he does, not a bite on the internet.  What is it going to take?  I think it was...  What is it going to take to blow this shit up so we can have something different?  I think it was pretty cool.  She was pretty cool about it yesterday.  Esther Koo was all right.  That's why, yeah.  People are really confusing because a lot of people really liked her and a lot of people 
[00:02:00]  didn't like her laugh or something.  She had one of them Asian girl laughs.  Yeah.  Put their hand in front of her face and go, oh yeah, oh yeah.  Was it kind of like an anime laugh?  Yeah, oh yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah, she was all right.  She had some stinky ass fucking backup players, though. 
[00:02:30]  I was trying to get that going, but no one was brave enough to come forward.  It was...  I was challenging Mars.  He let me down.  You know what it was?  I was challenging Roland.  He let me down.  Because they were all making these horrible faces.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because the smell was horrendous.  Especially the one guy with the big Yosemite Sam mustache.  The Derek Smalls.  Yeah.  Derek Smalls from Spinal Tap mustache.  He, wow.  He stunk so bad.  It actually brought a tear to my eye.  Not from the smell, because I was thinking of Tippy Tom. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, brought you back.  Yeah, brought me right back to his stench.  I wanted to talk to that guy.  Yeah, yeah.  It was all about Esther Koo yesterday, but that guy had something going on.  He had some stories.  He had a massive crystal on his chest that he dug up himself.  Yeah.  I don't know what kind of powers that crystal had, but...  He's a crystal miner.  He would mine for crystals, I guess.  But where are you mine for crystals?  South Africa?  Africa, he went there, and... 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So, um...  Yeah, he had this big green crystal around it.  It looked like kryptonite or some shit.  It did look...  And, uh...  Wow.  Maybe that just kept him from showering.  Mm.  It was like some magical thing that kept him from taking a fucking shower.  No, I figured out her deal.  She smokes pot every day, unless she was lying about that.  So she's running with the...  Running with a bad crowd?  Eh...  Well, if she's smoking pot every day...  Yeah.  ...and she's in Central Park every day, that's a dangerous combination. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Because you see the hippies just hanging around Sheep Meadow, it's called.  Yeah.  One part of the park.  And they all just kind of sit in their hippie circles and play music and stuff.  I fucking hate hippies.  So I think she might have walked through the park one day and sat down.  In the merry, merry month of May?  In the very, very month of May.  And she sat down there and she made some new friends.  Yeah.  They were horrible guitar players.  Yes. 
[00:04:30]  Awful.  And just...  Yeah, they stunk in every sense of the word.  And let me ask...  Figuratively, literally.  And this isn't fair to do.  We don't like doing this when the person's not here.  Yeah.  But we're discussing this.  But, yeah.  If she wasn't a adorable...  I was going to say a hot, but I think the word for her is adorable.  She was one of those, like, cute things.  If she wasn't an adorable Asian comedian...  Yeah.  If it was, say, a guy... 
[00:05:00]  Jesus.  Let's say it was a guy that kind of looked like Joe DeRosa.  Uh-huh.  And this guy was playing a ukulele...  Uh-huh.  ...and playing parody songs like that...  Right.  Would we have been as polite?  Well, there absolutely would have been things being thrown at him while he was playing.  Yes.  We would have thrown things at him.  Because people were yelling through their Twitters yesterday.  And they're like, what the fuck, guys?  But that's like...  I'm like, she's adorable, though. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  But that's like saying, oh, let's say a guitarist came in, and instead of being really good,  really sucked.  Yeah.  It's like, it's what it was.  Look, look, look at that.  Look, she's got a little pinky in her mouth.  She's wearing very high-on-her-head pigtails.  Right.  Like those little Japanese anime things.  Yeah, come on.  I think she's trying to look anime, too, in that publicity photo.  She does.  Does she have, like, serpents, like, fooling around with her pushing?  Trying to fuck her, big, like, guys with green glowing dicks. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, yeah, you fucking do it, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  Anime is so goofy.  I kind of like it in a weird way.  Do you?  Yeah.  I don't know.  My ex used to love that shit.  Used to love the anime?  Like, she would get off on anime porn, and I'm like, I'm sorry, I just don't see it.  Like, she'd want to pop some in and watch it.  Mm-hmm.  So she'd put in, like, a DVD and start watching it and really get all worked up.  And I'm watching, like, fuck it, I'd rather watch Bugs Bunny. 
[00:06:30]  She'd get really funny.  Did you ever ask her why she got worked up on the anime porn?  I tried to, like, get the idea what it was.  I don't know, man.  And it was the whole, like, yeah.  That's hot, though, right there.  That's like a Buxom thing with those big fucking Speed Racer eyes.  Speed Racer eyes.  Cool.  Very big bosoms.  Yes.  Very thin waist, and then you move out to kind of like a Kim Kardashian hip thing.  I got the hips.  Yeah, man, and the lingerie's on there. 
[00:07:00]  I know it's a cartoon, but that's kind of hot.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Yeah, but, you know, to watch a fucking anime porn, to me it's like, just fucking, I'd rather  watch just porn.  That's kind of hot.  Well, yeah, but.  They lose me when the eels get involved.  The big fucking.  And the tentacles.  Octopus tentacle dick thing.  Yeah, that's when they lose me.  Yeah.  But if it's a girl, like, looking like that, and then doing the.  Some evil Japanese guy grabbing his dick. 
[00:07:30]  His dick.  I got so excited yesterday because Gawker said, oh, boy, another wiener photo.  Did you see the latest wiener photo they released?  What's the latest one?  I didn't see it.  Is it a good one?  They got me so bad.  Because I got excited.  I'm like, this wiener thing is all, you know, we're all about it.  Wiener's all over the place.  Yeah.  They posted a brand new photo of wiener, and it's just this girl that sent in a picture  going, I don't know, but, you know, I took this picture with wiener. 
[00:08:00]  Oh.  And she's dressed up like a hot dog from a couple years ago.  Oh, gee.  And wiener's got his arm around her as she's dressed like a hot dog.  Oh, wiener and wiener.  I'm like, oh, man.  I get it.  That's crazy.  If they're posting pictures like that, I think the story's over.  The story's done.  By the way, once again, Gawker, where's my nice fucking bottle of wine?  Where's my thank you?  Ooh.  Because when we were tweeting that picture, I fucking put at Gawker.  And it was recognized as the site. 
[00:08:30]  It was recognized as the site, so I'm waiting for my thank you gift.  I don't do that shit for free anymore.  Where's my gift?  Keep.  Everyone tweet Gawker today and tell him that Ope wants a bottle of silver oak.  Cabernet.  Very nice.  I hear duck horn not as nice.  I was talking to a wine guy.  Really?  Do you like duck horn?  No, not as much as.  You're not a cab guy?  No, I'm not really a cab guy.  So why don't you, you're obviously part of this too. 
[00:09:00]  What kind of bottle of wine do you want?  Let's do this.  Well, I just had my wine closets restocked.  Who cares?  So, um.  We're talking about really nice wine.  Yes.  Something that might be a little dusty.  You know what I mean?  Where the label's starting to really kind of fall off.  I don't think you're going to get that from Gawker.  Well, we better because, you know, I purposely wrote at Gawker when I sent my picture.  I don't see that happening.  And they owe me.  Why?  Gawker people.  Why?  They're not the New York Times. 
[00:09:30]  It's Gawker.  Get me my fucking bottle of wine.  Probably send some cheap shit over here.  No, I don't want cheap shit.  There's the wiener picture, by the way.  Well, no embarrassing wiener photo emerges.  And it's him with a wiener.  Right.  Dressed up like a wiener with a mustard all over it.  Right.  I guess advertising for a wiener place.  How bad is your life if you got to dress up like a hot dog and walk around some village?  He is so fucking fixated on his dick.  His dick?  And I absolutely think that it has something to do with his name. 
[00:10:00]  And growing up with the name wiener is probably one of the roughest fucking things that can happen to a young man, a child growing up.  Sure.  Because kids, as we know, very cruel, Opie.  Of course.  Very cruel with the names.  And if your name is wiener growing up, you are going to fucking be, you know.  Remember Welcome to the Dollhouse?  No.  Welcome to the Dollhouse, that movie?  No.  It's fucking great. 
[00:10:30]  That's from the 60s or something.  No, no, no.  70s?  No.  80s?  That was a 90s fucking indie movie.  No, I don't remember that.  But the girl's name was wiener.  Oh, really?  And they would be like, wiener dog, wiener dog.  I'm going to fucking rape you, wiener.  Wiener dog.  She was such a ghoulish, creepy girl in that.  I don't remember that.  I don't think I saw the movie.  Remember this chick?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that was hilarious.  Okay, yeah.  That movie is great.  She gets a crush on the lead singer of her brother's dumb band that he plays clarinet in. 
[00:11:00]  The rock band that he plays clarinet in.  She fingers herself and she hurts her wrist.  I never saw this movie.  That's hilarious.  I recognize the girl.  Yeah.  Because I've seen that picture a million times.  But, all right, I'm going to Netflix this thing.  I'm going to check this out.  Yeah, that movie's fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  Just look at her locker.  See, wiener sucks.  Big time.  Big time.  And that's what wrote, big time.  Wiener dog. 
[00:11:30]  So you think the...  Fuck you, wiener dog.  You think going through life as Anthony Wiener really started to affect him?  I think that's what fucking did it.  You know, this guy...  Heather Mont...  You got...  Sarah Mont...  Or something like that.  And you got the president of the United States saying, you got to go, and he's just hanging  in there.  This is amazing.  Yeah.  At this point, it's amazing.  Well, now...  And I don't want him to leave.  I want to see...  I want to see this play itself out now.  Yeah.  I've never been a fan of the guy having to step down. 
[00:12:00]  I always want to see it play out.  See what happens when it plays out.  And see how just ugly it gets.  But this is it playing out.  He's taking it as far as it can go.  I know.  Everyone telling him to get the fuck out of here.  Even his constituents are now saying 60%, I think, it's up to.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And even Boner is telling everyone that Wiener's got to go.  Boner.  Boner's saying Wiener's got to go.  What the fuck?  You saw those headlines, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Boner says Wiener's got to go.  Wiener's got to go. 
[00:12:30]  And I guess McCarthy was saying that...  Hinting, right?  Yeah, hinting that he's gone within like a day or two.  Well, why is she babbling about that?  That's not her place.  Well, she's a New York fucking politician here on Long Island.  Shut her fucking mouth about guns.  Yeah, you don't like the gun thing with her, right?  Yeah, she's a real Second Amendment nudge.  Yeah.  We really...  Us in the NRA, we really don't like her very much as far as her politics.  She's in your way. 
[00:13:00]  No, no, not my way yet.  There's enough sensible people out there that listen to what she says and don't do anything about it.  But Plaxico is another asshole.  He's another one that's got to do his thing.  You know, he came out and like is joining together with the Brady people for the Brady...  You know, remember the Brady Bill?  There's a whole Brady Foundation on gun safety.  But it's not safety.  It's pretty much they want...  It's a huge gun control.  Wait, Plaxico went from carrying a gat in his underwear to now like... 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  ...this organization?  ...to now this organization.  What is wrong with people?  He's in kibbutz with them.  Does he mean it?  I doubt it.  Or is it part of his community service or something?  He probably loves guns.  Of course he loves guns.  If you put a gun down your sweatpants like that and you fucking got your gat.  He loves guns.  He loves guns.  He loves guns as much as Tracy Morgan loves talking about the gays.  Loves talking about the gays.  Right.  And he loves his guns, but he got caught. 
[00:14:00]  He went to jail.  So now he's got to play it the other way?  How about you love legal guns?  You know why he's doing it?  Yeah.  Because it's not a guarantee he goes back to the NFL.  Right.  So he's got to look like this guy.  Yep.  This is more fake shit.  It's the same shit with the fucking, you know, the dog fighting.  What's his fucking...  Oh, dog fighting guy.  Yeah.  Mike Vick?  Vick.  Michael Vick?  Yeah, Michael Vick.  I thought you meant Dog the Bounty Hunter for a second.  No, no.  Well, him too.  But Michael Vick went and started speaking out for animal rights. 
[00:14:30]  And the NFL snatched him back up.  He's this close to doing a middle of the night commercial.  Oh, one of those commercials.  Hi, Michael Vick.  Take care of this dog with crusty eyes.  We need a Sarah McLachlan for this bit.  His little paws up.  That's sad.  He can't walk but on three legs.  Yeah, here's a guy that used to hold the head of the dog under the water.  Under water and fucking drown the motherfucker.  And now he's a guy that's really close to doing the commercial. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Hi, this is Michael Vick.  If you got a dog or a cat that looked like this,  well, look at the cat with the crusty eyes and his runny nose.  Look at this dog.  He got no teeth.  Teeth.  Dogs got to have teeth.  He can't eat with no teeth.  I'm Michael Vick.  Pledge wherever you can to give these animals a home.  I used to drown the motherfucker, but I don't know more. 
[00:15:30]  Thank God I'm considered a pretty good goddamn quarterback.  Well, I wouldn't have no career left  because I'd make these dogs bite each other till one of them died or shit.  Look at this one.  Hobbling around.  What's that?  What's that manger shit on his ass?  Look like he's ashy.  He needs some lotion.  I'm Michael Vick.  Please give all you can to these little dog ass motherfuckers that I used to have bite each other's throat until they bled out. 
[00:16:00]  But not no more.  Not no more.  I'm saying please give generously to the Michael Vick dog ain't need no gookin' it's eyeball foundation.  And as you're doing that, there's a picture of Michael Vick holding a nice, cute little dog.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He doesn't want to be doing that.  Please.  That's in his DNA, man.  He's fucking...  He loves fighting dogs. 
[00:16:30]  He loves it.  You think as he was holding that dog, he's kind of shaking inside.  Getting the itch.  Fucking feel.  He's feeling the muscles going, it's a strong dog, motherfucker.  Getting the itch.  Yeah, look.  He's got his hand on that dog's chest.  Probably going like, ooh, that's a strong front end on this bitch.  Right.  I bet I'll put that one in the ring.  Just my humble opinion, there's no way he changed to the point where he's now holding  cute dogs in publicity photos.  Yeah, look.  There's no way that's the same guy.  The dog's adorable.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[00:17:00]  He wants that thing tossed in a ring.  Stop it.  These celebrities don't get that shit by me.  Maybe some other people.  Plaxico now...  And Plaxico now is with the Brady Gun Safety Foundation, whereby gun safety, by the way,  the whole Brady organization means, if there are no guns, you'll be safe.  You'll be safe from guns.  And that's the Brady way around it.  You know, and I gotta be honest with you, I used to sort of think that.  Yeah.  Until I started really listening to your gun stuff. 
[00:17:30]  I don't know where I am completely with it, but you've opened my mind.  Because you know what?  I do something very different than most fucking assholes out there.  You listen to both sides and then start kind of forming your own opinion on stuff.  Yeah, you form your own opinions.  And you've kind of turned me a little bit on the gun thing.  A little bit.  I mean, a lot of people would love a country with no guns.  But if there were no guns, if you could wave your magic wand today and have absolutely  zero guns in the United States... 
[00:18:00]  Then it would all make sense.  Well, it would make sense, but then you'd be like, well, I need a good club.  Because there's still...  Now, the guns are gone.  I'm not saying the violent people are gone.  Oh, now there we go.  Now you need a good, strong club or a knife because the bad guys are going to get a club  or a knife.  And then you're going to have to defend yourself with that.  And then there'll be knife or club control groups saying too many people are being killed  by guns or knives.  And it's...  By knives or clubs.  But it doesn't have anything to do with the guns anymore. 
[00:18:30]  It's still violent people that want to hurt other people out there.  Now, if you could wave your hand and get rid of that, then the guns wouldn't hurt anyone  because no one would want to kill anybody.  And then you'd just have fun at target shooting or hunting or doing whatever you want.  That'd be the occasional accident, but that happens with cars or anything else.  But you're still going to get violent people.  Oh, yeah.  So the gun argument really doesn't hold up.  And if you look at some of the biggest crime-ridden areas in the United States, they have the strongest 
[00:19:00]  gun control laws in the country.  Right.  So that really doesn't make much sense.  But I've said all this before.  Many, many times.  And in many, many different ways.  Yes.  I'd rather talk about Casey Anthony.  Oh, did I watch that trial yesterday?  Oh, boy.  The prosecution wrapping up pretty much.  I think today they'll wrap.  The defense takes over for maybe a week or maybe just short of two weeks, giving her  side of the story.  The defense is going to kill them, huh? 
[00:19:30]  Well, I don't think she's going to testify.  I absolutely don't think the prosecution made their case for murder one.  I didn't see it.  I watched a lot of this shit, but I did not see a case for a first-degree murder.  There's too much doubt there that it could have been accidental and she hid the kid, could  have been some type of neglect that killed the child and then she hid the body in the 
[00:20:00]  woods, could have been something to do with the father and her in cahoots, getting rid  of the body so as not to do something with the grandmother, you know, upset her.  There's too much shit out there, too much reasonable doubt where I don't think they're going to come  back with a murder one conviction for this Casey Anthony angel, this sweetheart of a girl.  Your tweets are great.  Oh, my God.  How do they get a hold of you?  They're housewives.  But how do they get a hold of you? 
[00:20:30]  I tag everything with the hashtag Casey Anthony.  Right.  So it goes to the big Casey Anthony page where all these house frows hang out and watch the  trial and tweet every two seconds.  So they see my tweets and a lot of, and here's what else I did, which was just killer.  So you're putting the hook in the water and they're going for it.  And they go for it.  And then I checked out on Twitter and I looked at everybody that was following Casey Anthony,  the hashtag Casey Anthony, from Orlando.  Now, I was only looking at the people from Orlando and they are fully involved in this. 
[00:21:00]  Of course.  So you find the mothers and the wives that their profile says, you know, I'm a mother  of three young boys or, you know, I'm a single mom.  And you hit them with like, you look at their tweets about the Casey Anthony trial, take what  they said, and you're just like, you're just jealous because you're fat and she's beautiful.  And they explode jealous.  She killed her daughter.  She, I go, Oh really?  You think so? 
[00:21:30]  I go, kids are mischievous.  She could have wandered off.  She got duct tape wrapped around her face.  I go, I know kids that get into a lot of dangerous things and play and they don't get it.  They get so pissed at this and I can't stop.  It's addictive.  That's fun.  Just keep fucking pounding away at these Yentas that, that have nothing but, but hatred  and disdain for the lovely, what I'm calling her now.  Um, apparently she got a tattoo.  Now the prosecution's really harping on this. 
[00:22:00]  The day her daughter went missing, Opie, and she obviously did not report her missing  for another 31 days.  Well, of course.  Um, but she said she was looking for her and she was using other avenues than the  police department.  She was looking though, because Zanny the nanny had her.  Oh, here's the tattoo as you talk about on CNN.  And there's the tattoo.  It says Bella Vita.  Bella Vita.  Which means beautiful life.  Aw.  And she got that tattoo, uh, on her back the day her kid pretty much disappeared and she 
[00:22:30]  hadn't told anyone.  Uh, so I've been putting hashtag Bella Casey, which means beautiful case.  And it pisses the fucking Yentas off so bad.  Why are they involved with this?  It's, it's one of the biggest soap operas, uh, out there now.  It, it, it has like all this, these little peripheral things that are great.  Uh, you know, no one knows who the father is of, uh, uh, Kaylee, the dead girl. 
[00:23:00]  No one knows who the father was.  Uh, she's the party girl.  Uh, especially like before this happened, cause jail's kind of, wow.  Weighing on, weighing on her heavily, but, uh, the pretty girl, nice cans on her, nice  ace.  And it's just got all the features.  She's white.  That's a big thing, you know?  And, uh, oh, if this was a black mom and you wouldn't hear about that, it wouldn't be  on, uh, it happens all the time.  Isn't it on like CNN and stuff too?  This is, you know what?  It's not court TV anymore.  No court TV is now true TV. 
[00:23:30]  So they have all their original programming, but court TV made its bones off the OJ trial.  Right.  HLN, uh, headline news, which.  Used to just be CNN.  Right.  Uh, and headline news.  Right.  And they would just go through the same stories every 20 minutes or so.  Right, right, right.  They are now covering this.  Wow.  And they are making their bones on this case.  Uh, it's, uh, it's great.  I punched up a camera yesterday that someone gave me a link to.  That is just Casey Anthony's face during the entire trial. 
[00:24:00]  So I have my TV going with the trial coverage and then a whole full screen on my 17 inch laptop  mount monitor of just Casey Anthony's beautiful, uh, face and, and lovely flowing hair.  And I've been screen capping her laughing.  Like, dude, if you're on trial for your fucking life, would you be laughing?  No.  She is the craziest bitch I've ever seen in my life.  Why the fuck is she laughing?  She's laughing.  Because it's about your dead kid this whole trial.  She gives eyebrows and like weird eyes to her lawyer sometimes. 
[00:24:30]  Like her eyebrows go up and she smirks like, hmm, hmm.  You think the lawyer's purse switch is going off?  I think the lawyer, I, I think.  I need a, I need 15 minutes with my client.  I think she's fucking her lawyer.  You think?  I think she's fucking a lawyer.  That's my opinion from what I see every day.  You're on 20 minutes with my client behind closed doors.  Yes.  If I can't get her off one way, I'm going to get her off another.  I think he's fucking the, uh, I think she's fucking the, the lawyer.  But, um, yeah, she, uh, so, so the prosecution's going to rest. 
[00:25:00]  And I, my, my personal, like layman's opinion, which I would be kind of the, the juror.  The jurors aren't pros at this.  No.  They are a jury of her peers.  You've watched just as much as the trial as they have.  Yeah, I've seen it all.  And, um, I absolutely don't think the prosecution has done its job, um, proving beyond a reasonable  doubt murder one on this whole thing.  Murder one is so tough to murder.  Murder one's hard.  Capital murder is very tough. 
[00:25:30]  Uh, you'd have to prove that.  That she meant to kill this girl, thought about it, came up with a motive, had the means,  the opportunity, uh, method.  They don't even have the method.  You know, you're supposed to have the, uh, motive, method, and means to a murder.  They don't really have the method.  They don't know.  They, they, they had people testifying.  They don't know how this girl died.  They speculate that it was duct tape over her mouth with this little heart.  This little heart sticker is supposedly was on the duct tape over the girl's mouth. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  When they found it, the sticker was, this little heart sticker was not on the duct tape.  But, uh, through forensics, they found, this woman found, uh, using a special ultraviolet  light that the heart shape, found a heart shape on the piece of duct tape.  Now you can imply or infer whatever you, you choose, uh, that the heart shape sticker was  over the mouth on the duct tape and that the mother would do this because these heart 
[00:26:30]  stickers were found in the house.  But the problem is the woman never, the forensics photographer never photographed the shape.  Uh, it, it never turned up on the piece of duct tape.  It's now gone.  So it's only her testimony saying that that's what I saw on the duct tape.  Now she's a professional.  She realizes I have a reason to lie, but I'm sorry.  There's no picture of it.  Right.  It's just your word.  Now you need the picture.  Yeah.  They dropped the ball on that one. 
[00:27:00]  I'm not following as closely as you, but it seems to me that, uh, obviously a very irresponsible  mother.  Yes.  The kid died.  Unfortunately, I don't think she murdered the kid.  I don't think she murdered.  I think it was an accident, accidental death.  Yeah.  Because of her irresponsibility.  Right.  Possibly with the Zanny thing.  Maybe she was using that thing.  Maybe OD'd.  Thinking, I, I, I know what I'm doing here.  Right.  Kid dies.  And now she's trying to cover it up.  Try to cover it up in one way or another.  It could have been the drowning in the pool, which they're saying.  And then they try to cover it up again. 
[00:27:30]  Make it look like a kidnapping.  Right.  Um, and another thing.  Do you think she murdered her kid?  No.  I don't think she murdered the kid.  I think she was a horrible, irresponsible mother.  But, and, and even with that, if you look back at anyone's testimony about what kind  of mother she was, they always say she was a good mother to her.  The kid was very healthy.  Never any sign of abuse or neglect on the child itself in any time before.  There's videos of her playing with the child very nicely. 
[00:28:00]  Never any relatives coming out and saying, well, she used to, you know, smack her in  the face or let her not eat or, you know, leave her home alone for hours on end.  No one's come up to say any of this shit.  So out of the fucking blue, she, uh, you know, winds up just killing her.  It sounds like it could have been some kind of accident.  Like maybe she was carrying on some kind of a drugging of this girl so she could go out  at night, uh, because she couldn't get a babysitter.  Um, but, and then there was some tragic, uh, accident. 
[00:28:30]  Uh, but as far as murder one goes, all they need is one person on that jury that thinks  like I'm thinking.  And I don't think the prosecution's done enough to, to make the entire jury believe  their story.  Sure.  That she purposefully killed this child and, and dumped it in the woods and went about  her business.  The tattoo.  Sure.  Why the fuck would you get a tattoo?  Beautiful life on your back the day after your child is missing and you haven't told anyone. 
[00:29:00]  Now the defense is going to argue that that's a tribute to her daughter.  Like, Oh, Oh, Kaylee just, she's the beautiful life that I gave life to.  There's plenty of ways to explain away everything the prosecution has said and cast doubt on it.  So a tattoo doesn't make the case.  And it's a, it's a 100% circumstantial case.  You don't have a witness.  You don't have a alibi that has to be dealt with.  So I really think she's not getting the murder one.  Um, if they have a mistrial or a hung jury or something happens like that, they might get 
[00:29:30]  her on a negligent homicide, a manslaughter, something like that.  Uh, but murder one, if you're rooting for it and yeah, she's when that needle slips in  and she's going to die from the death penalty, stop it.  It ain't happening.  That doesn't happen in general in our country anymore.  Yeah.  Right.  Except for Texas.  Texas is still strong.  Ant sounds like he wants her to get off just to have sex with her.  Yes.  That's what he's saying.  Why wouldn't I? 
[00:30:00]  If this was a black mother, he wouldn't even be watching.  I wouldn't even be, I have this case.  If this was a ugly white mom, he wouldn't be watching.  Right.  Fat mom.  Fat white mom.  Of course.  Who gives a shit?  I think we all know that Ant might have a little bit of a crush on her.  I'm just looking, she's perfectly my type.  This is the ultimate crazy broad for Antony.  She looks like complete white trash and she's batshit crazy.  That's my entire dating life and married life.  It's his whole existence.  Look, there's a picture of her in front of the toilet bowl. 
[00:30:30]  She's ready to puke from being drunk.  Oh, Bella Vita, Bella Vita.  Someone said that because it was a black tattoo artist that gave her the Bella Vita tattoo that  her defense will just be, she asked him to put her favorite type of cheese on the back  and he just put Bella Vita.  Nice.  All right.  Yeah.  It's a little jab at that, but we'll see what happens today.  Ant's keeping tabs on this whole thing.  So you don't have to.  Yes.  And people are laughing at her back knee that she has. 
[00:31:00]  And I was arguing, it's like, oh, I hope she gets out and you could help rub her back  knee.  And I'm like, she just got that from nerves.  She was very nervous and got that.  And people actually argue with me.  Her back looks awful.  What was that?  Yeah.  Well, she's wearing a tight tank top.  That was during the forensic photography of her tattoo.  Okay.  So, you know, she's wearing a sports bra thing there and that, uh, you know, it's hugging  a little tight and pushing out some fat.  She had a little chub going on there, but, uh, I think prison will, um, prison will help 
[00:31:30]  that out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Out in the yard doing a little workout, shit like that.  You know, just running away from all the, the big, the big bitches, the big bitches that  run the fucking block.  The big bitches.  They're just waiting.  She's going to be running an obstacle course every day.  Oh, forget about it.  Away from the big bitches.  Prime meat.  Them's big bitches.  Prime meat.  That one.  All right.  Very good.  Um, that's your Casey, uh, Anthony, uh, trial update.  I believe Patrice is going to come in, which means we're not going to be able to play a 
[00:32:00]  lot of audio.  No, it's, which is fine.  By the way, that's the audio.  Yeah.  Patrice and his mouth will be here soon.  People were wondering what his take would be on this trial and the fact that, uh, if it  was a black woman and stuff and, and these two white girls that have gone missing  and you see their faces plastered on television and the.  Beautiful college girls, blonde hair.  And, uh, we're looking at that like, Oh my God, we got to find these girls and black  girls.  Uh, you know, there's posters up all the time and yeah, you never really see this kind 
[00:32:30]  of coverage.  Hey, yeah, that's just how it is.  I guess it, uh, we'll ask Patrice about that.  And I want to talk some LeBron with him to LeBron because now people are coming out of  the woodwork.  Like give LeBron a break.  New statement by LeBron, by the way.  I didn't see the new statement.  He's covering his tracks.  He's saying he, yeah, because you know, we put out that statement that made it sound  like he was better than the people that watched basketball and they have to go on to their  shitty little lives.  And by the way, once again, cause it's a theme lately, that's what he truly believes. 
[00:33:00]  Of course it is.  But now he's got the big powerful people around him going, yo, Hey, Hey, you're losing your  sneaker money.  Yeah.  Maybe your Gatorade money.  I don't know who his sponsors are.  Like you got to calm the fuck down.  These people are buying your shit.  Yeah.  So now he's coming up with some fake statement, right?  Yeah.  He said, basically I was saying at the end of the day, the season is, uh, uh, over.  Uh, let's say basically the season is over and with all the hatred, not only myself,  everyone else has to move on with their lives as well. 
[00:33:30]  And then he also said that he was never ever implying to or trying to put himself in a place  of superiority above the people that hate him.  And he probably would have gone further and said, I love the people that do nothing but  blast me on Twitter and message boards and, and, uh, uh, go to the games and hate on me.  Hey man, he did this to himself.  Of course he did.  The way he left Cleveland, he did this.  And, and now just being a chump in the NBA finals, he did this to himself. 
[00:34:00]  He did not show up again.  Yeah.  In the fourth quarter, he was a disaster this entire series.  And he acknowledged that and, uh, said they have to move on next year.  He's a fucking head case.  Yeah.  You know, and I'm taking on the LeBron guys.  Oh really?  You're having fun with the Casey Anthony.  I'm taking on one guy's like, uh, he's an NBA superstar.  Well, what have you done with your life?  And I wrote, Hey, me and him are exactly the same.  Both of us don't have an NBA championship. 
[00:34:30]  Oh shit.  No, you did.  Oh shit.  No, you did.  So I've been taking on those assholes.  Yeah.  He's in the NBA.  Great.  But he wants to be considered Michael Jordan and he's, he's not even close.  He's a choke artist.  I mean, Kobe Bryant's trying to still be like, you know, Michael Jordan and look what he's  accomplished.  And, and they'll argue that point with all the accomplishments Kobe had.  This guy is not even fucking close to any of that shit yet. 
[00:35:00]  He's a chokered.  And he's been around a while now, by the way.  I think he's done eight or nine years in the NBA.  Really?  That long?  I think so.  He started at 18, right?  And he's, uh, I think he's pushing 27, 28 now.  Boy, they sure loved him in Cleveland for a while.  Yeah, man.  He was, he was their guy.  That giant fucking poster of him, that giant billboard thing outside the arena.  They're celebrating.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  But he's a head case.  Dwayne Wade is finally realizing, holy shit, what did I get myself into? 
[00:35:30]  This guy just falls apart when the pressure's on him for whatever reason.  Maybe, maybe he doesn't, you know, that winning thing scares him or something.  I don't know.  I think if it's just bad luck at the wrong time.  Or is it a psychiatrist?  Uh, probably a psychologist.  Patrice will break this down way better than I can.  Yeah.  I certainly will, will, uh, you know, discuss with him.  He'll, he'll break it down for you.  Break it down.  If you watch basketball, this guy's a fucking head case. 
[00:36:00]  And yeah, he had the ball in the fourth quarter and, and he, he couldn't take the shot.  He, you sit, you saw the panic on his face.  Really?  Yeah.  It wasn't that he was just having a bad game.  There's something else going on.  Cause he always wonder, you know,  He was so unsure of himself.  Bad time to be in a slump.  It wasn't.  I was like, ah, like I said, Patrice will break down.  It was way more than a slump.  I'm sure Patrice is chomping at the bit to, to give his opinion on that whole thing. 
[00:36:30]  Oh yeah.  Hey, before, uh, uh, Patrice comes in, Gene Simmons.  Ugh.  I never liked Gene Simmons, to be honest with you.  No, no.  I grew up a bit of a Kiss fan.  Uh, I always thought he was a pompous douche.  And then when he came in a few times, I was just like, asshole.  You know.  Yeah.  He gave us great radio though, but he'll never be doing our, he won't do our show anymore.  It's great radio because he's such an asshole.  Yes, yes.  You know, which we can acknowledge.  Yeah.  Um, he, uh, he and his wife, it's his wife. 
[00:37:00]  Thank you.  It's your fucking wife.  Whatever the fuck she is.  Shannon Tweed have uncomfortable interviews.  Now, uh, this is a work.  Of course it is.  And if you don't understand that, I don't know what to tell you.  It's that Gene Simmons show, the Family Jewels show.  It's a work.  Gene Simmons, you know, walks around like he's allowed to fuck in.  And he's a woman.  And he probably is.  He probably has an open marriage.  But it's Sharon's job to be kind of a little uncomfortable with this whole thing. 
[00:37:30]  And be pissed off.  Yeah.  She's not pissed off.  They, they worked this shit out years ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, but that whole thing is now even passe.  It's like, oh boy, look out for their open marriage.  Oh, let's hear about it.  We've been hearing about it for years.  Right.  You're not shocking anyone.  I saw one episode of that fucking show, by the way.  And it was, uh.  I couldn't stomach it.  I guess they were trying to buy some property down a hill to fucking expand their property  or something.  And they had the neighbor, they wanted to, like, they wanted the neighbor to agree to 
[00:38:00]  something and have to sign off on something.  So they invited the neighbor into their house for, like, a drink and kind of to just hang  out and get to know each other.  And it was some of the worst scripted fake bullshit.  How people are just fucking taken by this phony television that's out there now is beyond  me.  I still get people that go, dude, you gotta watch the repo show. 
[00:38:30]  The guy fucking starts squirting the bitch with a hose and the big guy punches him in the  face.  No.  And that's why, uh, we're, that's why this is on TV.  People are buying into it.  People buy into it.  The problem with reality shows, the Osbournes was so just amazing.  That was the first one with legit celebrities, you know, allowing cameras to follow them around.  And, uh, and they've been trying to get another hit like the Osbournes.  But then all these producers go into these houses and go, wow, these, these celebrities 
[00:39:00]  are dullards.  Yeah.  So then they have to write shit for them.  They gotta start writing shit.  Or, yeah, script.  We call it scripted reality or enhanced reality or whatever they call it.  It's not reality.  No.  The problem is people are, you know, buying into it.  So you're going to continue seeing it this way.  The Kardashians fucking keeping up with the Kardashians started their new season on Sunday.  I think it was.  Yeah.  2.5 million fucking assholes are watching this shit.  Assisted reality. 
[00:39:30]  Yes.  You're watching really hot girls just look at their, uh, their phones all day.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah.  That's what they do.  People love it.  And then the mom wishing she was one of the daughters.  Yeah.  And, and, and it's just, it just goes to show you that people are sucked in by, they think  just because they're seeing it or reading it or listening to it, that it's real.  And, uh, if one, if one more person sends me that dumb fucking McDonald's thing about  African-Americans being charged another $1.50 because of the, the crime and stuff in McDonald's 
[00:40:00]  and it's like, dude, check it out.  I want, did you look and see that this was a complete fucking farce?  I want honesty on my Twitter today.  Yeah.  Did you think that was a real fucking sign that they put up at a McDonald's or, or were  you smart enough to realize this is obviously a hoax and a really good one?  Yeah.  Cause the first time I saw that, I'm like, this is impossible.  This is, this did not happen. 
[00:40:30]  McDonald's years ago, for some reason, I don't know why has really steered its advertising  dollars towards the black community.  And, uh, they have all kinds of, um, websites that are, uh, McDonald's run about diversity  in the workplace and, uh, they love the diversity on either, either side of the counter is what  they say.  Right.  Either side of the counter.  So would they really have this note?  So they have a note that says, please note as an insurance measure due in part to a recent 
[00:41:00]  string of robberies, African-American customers are now required to pay an additional fee of  $1.50 per transaction.  Thank you for your cooperation.  McDonald's corporation.  I'm loving it.  Golden arches.  And then there's an 800 number, uh, to call, uh, and it looks as if it's pasted on a McDonald's,  uh, door, which it very well could be.  If you just slap that on there after you printed it out, snap the picture, take it away.  Uh, it lives on forever in the picture.  Now you post it and, uh, people actually, they believe and, and weeks later. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  I didn't believe for a second fucking posting it and sending it like, dude, it's just you.  They're like, it's just you.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And I would not even, I would not even read it.  I'd say, is this you with a link?  Mm-hmm.  And then I, why am I clicking it?  I know what this is.  Yeah.  You're, you're, you're dumb.  You're fucking dumb, America.  I'm talking to America.  You're dumb.  America. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, uh, people, I pre says it should be $3.50.  He said, by the way, because it would be believable.  Yes.  Then I would believe it.  $1.50.  Not quite enough.  $1.50.  You're not going to rack the string of robberies.  $1.50.  You're not going to keep the colored out of McDonald's.  No, that's not going to keep them out.  But if it's like five bucks, now you're knocking down the numbers.  Right.  Maybe you won't get a fucking boot through your soda machine.  Or someone's weave plastered, uh, through the, the smoothie machine.  Hey, uh, but getting back to Gene Simmons in this. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  That's where we started.  I guess it's called assisted reality, unfortunately phoniness.  I remember keeping up with the Kardashians where they all sudden out of nowhere, like,  you know, I think we need a gun in the house.  So they went through kind of gun training and then they went to a gun range.  That's the whole purpose.  And then by the end of the episode, they decided, you know, we don't need a gun.  Yeah.  So obviously someone wrote that, like, you know what a good episode would be?  You guys, you guys shoot, you guys shoot guns and kind of talk about needing a gun.  Not even that.  I bet it was this.  I bet it was a phone call that's like, how are you doing? 
[00:43:00]  Uh, we run a, we run a gun range and we would love to somehow get involved with the Kardashians.  And, uh, again, we'll pay for some advertising and stuff.  Cause you know how all that works.  We run with the things you need.  We all pay for some advertising and stuff.  Uh, how about that?  All right.  I think we could write that into the show.  Right.  Uh, we'll have the girls like decide they want to get a gun and we'll take them down to  this range and yeah, good idea.  Okay.  We'll get in touch.  So it's not the girls making the reality.  It's the show forcing this fake reality onto, uh, the girls. 
[00:43:30]  Honestly, we got, I got to say, what do we know?  People are watching these shows, man.  Oh God.  They are watching these shows.  That hard eating it up.  There's another one.  Hardcore pawn.  Now the, the other pawn one, which is, uh, pawn stars, I, I think there are shenanigans  going on in there between the family members and everything.  I can see that, but for the most part, it looks like legitimate people bringing in legitimate  items and then they price them and, and see if they want to sell it or whatever. 
[00:44:00]  This hardcore pawn is such bullshit.  They got like this, it's supposed to be in Detroit.  They got these gangsters coming in, trying to pawn off or sell this, this obviously stolen  shit or a shit that, that is so dated like a VCR.  Right.  And they get into fights with the people.  It's so fake.  And it, it goes, what I say, cause it's on true TV and they say, not reality, actuality.  And it makes you think like, wow, this is so real that it's beyond reality. 
[00:44:30]  It's actuality, which is a perfect, they fucking thought this out perfectly.  Actuality isn't a real word.  They made it up.  So they made it up.  So it's actual, not reality, actuality, which means, which means they got away with saying,  look, this shit ain't real.  Which means this happened, uh, in the past to somebody.  Eh, perhaps.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  We made this shit up.  We're telling you it's not reality.  It's almost like, the slug line of our channel says not reality. 
[00:45:00]  It's, it's a reenactment of something that, uh, these guys heard might've happened one  time somewhere else.  That's what actuality means.  It's urban legend.  Right.  But listen, I want to get the Gene Simmons story out of the way, cause this is big and  people are talking about it and we want to be, uh, the guys that tell you this is  all bullshit.  Yeah, please.  Uh, Gene Simmons and Shannon Tweed have uncomfortable interviews because I guess they're promoting  their, uh, their, um, their new season.  Yeah.  So they go on, uh, Kathy Lee and Hoda.  Oh, great.  Wow.  Those two dumb broads.  I got, I just got to applaud when I hear those two names. 
[00:45:30]  Those two dumb broads that I'm obsessed with.  And, uh, Gene and Shannon are uncomfortable.  The ladies ask about a show clip where Shannon is mad at a picture taken of Gene with two women.  Well, it's tense in the studio.  I got to tell you folks, I've had you both on many, many times.  We love you guys, but this concerns me.  This is, this is, you're in deep pookie, Gene.  Kill me now.  So Gene, what you just said that you didn't know those girls except for from that photo?  Please. 
[00:46:00]  What he means is he doesn't know their name.  It, oh, it was a, it was a business, uh, dinner.  And we always, you should always have flowers on the table.  Let's do a nice day today, did you notice?  Hi.  Positioning my microphone.  Is that what you're doing?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Um, well then what are you guys going to do about this?  You're going to, what am I going to do?  Yeah, Shannon, what's he going to do?  Either one could answer that.  Go ahead.  Well, it's, uh, it's clear that men, uh. 
[00:46:30]  Please don't lump yourself in with other men are good.  Oh, God.  I'm so happy to be here.  There's some really good ones over there on that couch I'd like to get a hold of.  Have a minute.  Thanks.  God, I hate him.  He's such a douche.  Well, I'm adjusting my microphone.  His slow speaking pattern that, because he wants everyone to take every word he says as a golden nugget of wisdom. 
[00:47:00]  He's such an asshole.  And she sucks, too.  And she stinks.  The acting was horrible.  If this was a real thing where she wasn't in on it, why isn't she leaving?  Yeah, why isn't she leaving?  Why is she on the show in the first place?  Is he that good of a catch?  Cassie Lee's setup was great, though, huh?  That was believable.  Yeah.  Why isn't she leaving?  Yeah.  I'll talk for the broads out there.  There's not a broad out there that would deal with the Gene Simmons. 
[00:47:30]  And where do they live?  California?  Look, you know what the laws are in California as far as not even being married?  Just fucking palimony?  Oh, she would walk away with some shit.  She'd take half of Kiss's shit.  Right.  Half of Kiss's shit.  Fuck a prenup.  Fuck everything.  Because there ain't no prenup.  She'd get half of Kiss's shit.  Do you think Gene is having sex with a lot of women?  Or is this completely fake?  Well, he did have sex with that one.  We saw that horrible video of him pumping away on just fucking having a convulsion on 
[00:48:00]  a woman.  Like an old lion.  Oh, yeah.  He's fucking like an old lion with his ass just going, oh, oh, oh, oh.  The underslung ass, just humping her.  It's a humping.  The woman got a humping from Gene Simmons.  The uncomfortableness, because this got crazy yesterday.  Oh, I bet this got, wow.  Shannon's fed up with Gene. 
[00:48:30]  So we're going to see in this whole new series, this relationship unraveling, right?  To this point.  Well, it's pretty much unraveled.  Did you have a fling with those girls, or was it just a picture?  I've had a fling with many girls.  Did you?  We, you know, if somebody, look, they're taking our photo right now.  Are they answering questions or not?  Taken out of contact.  No, they're just, that's our look.  I've never seen you tongue-tied.  I've, very good.  I've never seen those two girls before until we. 
[00:49:00]  You called them.  No, I didn't call them.  The, you know, our.  Your people.  Our people called them.  Uh-huh.  What, how's this, what's the status right now of you guys?  Well, you'll see.  I don't want to give away everything.  Oh, God, right there, right there.  Right there proves it's all fake.  Thank you.  Good night.  Well, you'll see.  Because it's more important to get ratings for your TV show than talking about how your  marriage might be in trouble.  That's fucking bullshit.  If you're really angry. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  You know, any time there's been, throughout the years, whenever anger has popped up on  this radio show between whatever members of the show it was, and there has been some  battles between, the argument has never stopped for the participants to go, and by the way,  argument's going to continue after these words, so don't go away.  Hey, you play it out because you're genuinely pissed, and you have genuine emotion that  you want to get out. 
[00:50:00]  That's so fucking fake, and I can't believe I have to actually say this, that it's fake.  But people, again, America is dumb.  Kathy Lee and Hoda should be the ones going, all right, come on.  Yeah, come on.  Give it up.  This is so stupid and fake.  Stop it.  But instead, they're like, oh, I guess we're going to have to watch then.  Yeah.  Well, well, tune in and see what happens between Gene and Shannon.  And, oh, boy.  Hope they have the show on at the Botox shop.  Is there a Botox shop? 
[00:50:30]  There should be.  Ted's Botox shop.  Botox.  It should be spelled shoppy.  Two P's and an E's and an E.  Shoppy.  Everything, but not looking great.  It's not looking right.  Well, you guys have kids, which is a series.  My kids are in college.  They're cooked.  I'm done.  I'm done.  As standardized Clay would say.  Nicholas graduated with honors from college.  Sophie is now, as a matter of fact, driving her little smart car all the way to Canada 
[00:51:00]  just to get away for a few days.  He held it together until he got to college.  Yay!  A lot of couples do that.  Is driving...  Could I speak any slower?  No, I'm Gene Simmons.  He's so hateable.  He's so hateable.  Listen to what I say.  It's very important. 
[00:51:30]  Fucking asshole he is.  Jesus, I hate him.  With his stupid Darth Vader hair.  Oh, it is.  Fucking asshole.  It says it looks like a Darth Vader helmet.  What a fucking dick.  Oh, man.  He's got the worst hair.  That is horrible.  Way worse than Donald Trump.  It looks like pubes.  I don't know what it is.  It has the consistency of pubes.  It's not like real hair. 
[00:52:00]  It is a helmet of, like, lint.  His hair is like lint.  Shaped into hair.  They need an angle for this new season.  He wants to rock.  She's ready to roll.  Oh, I get it.  He wants to rock.  She's ready to roll.  She's going to leave.  Do we realize these are people in their 60s?  Right.  Fucking come on.  We're not talking youngsters here.  Oh, he wants to party, does he? 
[00:52:30]  Gene wants to sit home, kick his feet up, and watch TV.  And she's content fucking being a house frow.  Gene has never been about the rock.  No.  Sorry to the Kiss fans out there.  He's never been about the rock.  Sorry.  It's about the money.  It's always been about the money.  He doesn't want to rock.  And he's doing the rock fucking hand.  The rock horns with his hand.  And she's got her arms folded.  And she's got her arms crossed.  Uh-oh.  You ain't doing that.  Don't cross her.  And he's like, I'm going to rock. 
[00:53:00]  And she's like, oh, I don't know where you are.  Well, guess what I'm going to do.  He's like, look at me.  I'm going to rock.  I got my hair and my glasses and my sunglasses on.  She's like, I'm folding.  No, you're not.  I'm like, Shaggy, you're grandparents.  Shut up.  Oh, God.  And he didn't want to do our show, huh?  Because I think we're one of the only shows that challenge him on this shit.  Yeah.  Then they went on Joy Behar.  What the fuck happened there?  I hope Joy at least called them out.  You'd like to think. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, you would.  Because I think Joy is, you know.  Joy.  I saw her at the Pat Cooper roast.  And man, does she have a potty mouth.  Oh, yeah.  And you've done her show.  Yeah, yeah.  So I hope she called them out on this.  Because, all right, on Kathy and Hoda, they're obviously splitting up.  So why would they now go and do another interview?  Yeah, yeah.  So they're going around together doing interviews about how they don't want to be together and  you have to watch.  Yeah.  Stop it.  What's going on over there? 
[00:54:00]  He's a pig and I don't like it.  He's a pig.  Okay.  And I'm done.  You're finished with him?  But you're not married, so you don't have to get a...  I'm fucking...  Did she say I'm fucking...  It sounded like she goes, I'm fucking...  This is off the website, so...  Oh, you could have potty language.  What would have changed?  Because, you know, this isn't Jean in a midlife crisis.  Oh, fuck.  Jean has always been this way.  And she's always accepted it.  Yeah, so what's...  It wasn't like he was hiding anything from her ever. 
[00:54:30]  No, they were supposed to...  It was such public knowledge that these two were in this open relationship.  Whoa, look out!  But, yeah, what changed to make it...  Now it's a part of the show that something bad happened.  What changed is the show needed a little pump.  Needed a little boost.  A little boost.  Needed a little...  People stopped caring after five seasons.  Exactly.  And so somebody went to him and said, you know what, wouldn't really make people watch  again?  You know, get those numbers up?  You're mad.  You guys officially start fucking fighting and talking about how it's over. 
[00:55:00]  How you guys are splitting up so people...  You know, because people genuinely have an affection for you two together.  And if you split up, people are going to be like, no, no!  Really?  I don't think so.  Oh, God, I hate Gene Simmons.  Oh, Chelsea Handler went all over Gene Simmons.  Do we have that clip?  Let me, really quickly...  Tom, go ahead.  Buffalo.  Hit it, Tom.  Hey, good morning.  That's what I was called to tell you about, was Chelsea.  She was phenomenal with him.  She was great. 
[00:55:30]  Really?  Was it last night?  No, no, no.  It was like...  I think it was last Friday.  Shit.  I watched the DVR, so I don't know exactly.  But in the past couple...  The past three days.  Four days.  God, I missed that Buffalo or...  Actually, it's a Western New York accent.  I don't even know if you're from Buffalo, but I think you live in Buffalo.  I am.  You're from...  Wow.  Wow.  I was here when you were here, Opie.  All right, right on.  I'm older than you.  Wow, 72?  No, I'm 33.  No, I meant the year, dummy.  No, I'm a couple years older.  Yeah, just a couple years older. 
[00:56:00]  All right, brother.  Thanks, Tom.  Bye, guys.  God, I missed that Western New York accent.  Yeah, so Gene and Shannon talked to Joy about the show clip with the picture.  Oh.  Oh, so they're...  Same deal.  Holy shit.  So that's the clip that they released to the media.  That's the whole thing that they based their promotional thing on.  Could you imagine me and my ex-wife going around and saying, well, yeah, we're pretty  mad at each other here.  Oh, you. 
[00:56:30]  Trying to rape me over the...  Rape me over the coals.  Rape me.  I know that, too.  Could you imagine that?  No, no.  I can't either.  But do people realize this is fake?  No.  No.  I think one of our bosses sent an email saying this is real.  Come on.  No.  No.  Oh, yeah.  No.  No.  I might have deleted this.  Oh, wait.  I probably have it.  I might have deleted this.  I probably have it in the unread messages.  I deleted mine.  Do you have it? 
[00:57:00]  Let me see.  Oh, bup, bup.  Now, Danny Ross...  Does a news thing every night.  Does news stories.  Right.  Every night he sends...  He's got, you know, the teachers sending the kitty pics and the Montel partners with pot  dispensary.  All kinds of fun things we could talk about.  Right.  But then, Steve Blatter decided he was going to pop in and maybe top off the list of stories.  Help with the show prep.  Help with the show prep.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Not at all.  There's nothing wrong with that.  And it's Shannon Tweed walks out on Gene Simmons during taping of the Joy Behar show. 
[00:57:30]  And then there's a link to the clip, I guess.  So, we are playing the clip, right?  Well, that was...  So, he helped out.  Well, you just blew the big get here.  Oh, shit.  Damn it.  Give a fuck.  Damn it.  You just blew it at.  Oh.  Hold on a second.  That is.  She walks...  Oh, boy.  Dave in Texas.  Dave.  Damn me. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, I didn't let you guys know, man.  Covino and Rich completely fell for that bullshit.  Oh, man.  And they were just...  It was awful.  Really hard to listen to.  Oh, man.  I like those guys.  We got to teach them a little more about this radio thing.  Radio biz that you got to call people out every so often.  You know how confident I am in the fact that this is fake?  Yeah.  I heard about this.  I swear to you, I haven't even heard these clips yet.  No.  I don't need to.  I just know.  You don't even have to.  You know it's fake. 
[00:58:30]  So, I want to say that.  Yeah.  That's how confident I am that what we're about to hear is completely fake.  It's fake.  It was awful to listen to.  All right, Dave.  Thank you, sir.  So, let's get into this.  Joy Behar.  What's going on over there?  All right.  I had a...  He's a pig and I don't like it.  He's a pig.  Okay.  And I'm done.  You're finished with him?  But you're not married, so you don't have to get a divorce.  Isn't that good?  You're not married either.  No, that's right.  You're not married.  That's fucking...  What?  A couple things.  Yeah.  How much fucking Botox did she have? 
[00:59:00]  Because her mouth doesn't move anymore.  Yep.  She's talking through like a puppet or something.  And secondly, you just explained California.  It doesn't matter if you're married.  It doesn't matter.  Either way, Gene Simmons would be fucked in this situation.  Fucked in his eyes.  And Joy knows that by, you know, you're not married.  That doesn't matter in California.  And then why does he have to go, you're not married?  I'm rubber your glue.  Whatever I...  Good.  You're not married either. 
[00:59:30]  No, that's right.  You're not married.  No.  So, it was a nice day today, didn't you think?  What?  He's got nothing.  What do you have, two girls that you took a picture with while you were on the road?  Two?  No.  Are you killing me right now?  Give me two.  Well, we're out of time.  Two thousand.  We...  What was the question?  We went out to dinner.  It was a business meeting.  You don't need to explain.  It's not about that.  She was asking me...  It's not about that day.  It's about what?  The life. 
[01:00:00]  The life of you.  You've been with him for 27 years.  Is it new?  I'm tired.  I'm tired.  28.  I'm tired of it.  You're tired of the life?  Well, the kids went to college, and I'm tired of his life.  Which is?  That.  That's stuff.  Stupid crap.  Yeah, see?  She doesn't want to say what it is.  So, after 28 years of him going around saying that he gets to fuck whatever he wants, she's  finally tired of it.  Now she's tired of it.  Now she's fucking tired of it.  Again, it's fake. 
[01:00:30]  She stayed in this fake fucking bullshit for the kids?  Get out of here.  Oh, yeah.  For the kids.  Get out of here.  We have an open relationship.  I get to do whatever I want.  I could be with whoever I want.  If she doesn't like that, she can leave.  Because guys have a lot of sperm.  Men are different than women.  If I may explain.  No, no.  Don't interrupt me.  If I may explain. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, it just takes him forever to get those magical words out.  Oh, is he the worst?  To this day, the greatest moment was when he put his hand on Danny's hand or Danny was  typing.  God forbid Danny was typing shit for the radio show.  Yes.  Oh, perish the thought.  Danny's typing.  It's like in the background, a little of this.  And fucking douchebag, Gene didn't even fucking miss a beat. 
[01:01:30]  Uh, yes, uh, KISS will be, uh, getting, uh, tour together.  And he just leans his hand over and puts it right on top of Danny's hand to make him  stop typing while, while his majesty is fucking yapping about nothing.  Please find that clip.  Oh, it's classic.  We haven't played that in a while.  You just hear.  Right.  And then it just stops and Gene continues his dumb diatribe of bullshit. 
[01:02:00]  We've, uh, we've, we've always been fans of having the noise of the room.  Right.  When we broadcast.  I like the ambient sound of a radio show.  That's why you hear the door close every day.  Yeah.  Mic squeak every so often.  There you go.  That was on cue.  The door is closed.  The door closes.  Jimmy's farting.  Whatever.  And a lot of like serious broadcasters.  Yeah.  They want those type of microphones where if you're an inch off the mic, you can't hear  anything.  You can't hear anything.  Ow.  We hate that.  We always hated that.  And we kind of like that.  All of a sudden you might hear some typing in the background or something. 
[01:02:30]  And you're not Gene.  It does go back to, um, I'll give, I'll give Howard some props on that one.  Remember years ago, you'd hear Fred just rattling the carts around when he used to use fucking  carts.  Yeah.  I always thought that was kind of cool because it gave you kind of a, a mental image of what  was going on in the studio.  It didn't have to be just this broadcaster on his microphone.  Perish the thought.  That any ambient sound is coming from the background.  It's, I think it's great to have like little things going on. 
[01:03:00]  People yapping.  Uh, and if I start doing a read, it took, I think years to stop people from going, shh,  shh.  Right.  It's like, I don't care if people are just kind of, you don't hear it.  It's just a little background noise.  Yeah.  I like that about our show.  I, I, I said it as far as my music goes and, and how we do radio.  I, I like, I call it having a little dirt.  Yeah.  I like a little dirt in my music.  A little dirt.  When you get into a band and then they go in that studio and make that over the top  polish shit. 
[01:03:30]  Pristine.  I fucking hate that.  That's usually when I start, you know, turning from liking a band.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, you hear a little, a little grittiness.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  A little dirt.  A little dirt.  Just a little.  Well, I hear you, uh, Joy Behar continues with Shannon and Jean talk about doing the  next five episodes of the show.  So let me try to understand this because I don't know what's going on here.  It sounds like you have been together a long time.  You have your, um, philandering ways. 
[01:04:00]  Is that the one I'm hearing?  I like that word.  Is it true, Jane?  There have been.  There have been.  Are there any now?  Not right now.  Not right this minute.  In the last, what, month?  But, you know.  Month?  In the last month.  Month, would you say?  No.  No.  Congratulations.  So she seems to have had it.  Could you pause us for a second?  I hate this.  These two are dullards.  I hate this.  They are fucking dullards.  Joy Behar is, is fucking tap dancing.  She's, she's fucking sweating. 
[01:04:30]  She's tap dancing for her life here.  She's the one talking.  And then you get the, the overly important Gene with his, uh, fucking wisdom.  And then, uh, Shannon with one word answers.  Mm-hmm.  And fucking, uh, they, they're, they're bore fests.  Right.  Ugh.  And what, Gene goes and has sex with whoever he wants?  And then, that's what I do.  And then he comes home and is like, oh boy, I'm going to be in a little trouble.  I could be in Dutch today. 
[01:05:00]  Yes, Dutch.  No, you're not in any trouble.  You're promoting a TV show with the same fucking act.  Gene, you're not in trouble.  And Shannon, you don't give a fuck.  You don't care.  If, if, if this is even happening.  And poor Joy is fucking spinning plates and hula hooping.  Right.  Uh, to try to get this interview anywhere.  But don't you understand?  Just having Gene on your show, man.  Just the name, Gene Simmons.  Just the name, man.  It doesn't matter.  It's going to bring in the people.  It doesn't matter if he actually performs for you.  Fuck Gene Simmons and his asshole. 
[01:05:30]  You're lucky just to have him on your show.  Right.  We were lucky to have him on our show over the years.  Congratulations.  So she seems to have had it.  Pretty much.  And yet you're on television in this reality show.  It's in the can already?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's in the can.  How many more episodes after the one I just showed?  So she's had it, but she's out promoting the show.  She's still there.  So obviously.  The show is filmed.  The show's done.  But they're going to promote it together. 
[01:06:00]  Which means, aren't they still together?  Wouldn't she just go, you know what?  Fuck you.  Yeah.  I'm not doing any promotion.  This marriage is over.  Yeah, we've already filmed this.  So good luck with that.  So do you leave him in the show that's already filmed?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I left him.  So what are you doing here?  Right.  What the fuck are you doing here?  And to the dummies, what network is that?  A&E.  To the dummies at A&E, wouldn't it have worked better if it was just Gene and Gene tells everyone, 
[01:06:30]  yeah, man, she just refuses to do press.  She is fucking pissed.  And I don't want to tell you what happens.  You're going to have to watch.  But it's not good.  But to have them both together after the show was taped to make and make him believe that  this marriage is over is a crock of shit.  It's a crock of shit.  Oh, God.  I hate this.  So it's after the one I just showed.  Well, I hope another five.  They ordered another five after that.  They did.  I can stand it. 
[01:07:00]  Are you going to do the five, Shannon?  I might.  You might.  All righty.  Can you talk, you fucking bitch?  You might.  Are you going to do it?  I might.  Why would you?  I thought you said you were fed up.  How about elaborating on the fact that you might or might not or just say something?  Now you know why she, what, her movie career was horrible, like B-movies or whatever it  was?  She fucking spread her fucking legs in Playboy or whatever.  That's what she's known for.  Fuck her.  She tried to be an actress, and now we know why she never got any real roles. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, God.  Poor Joy.  How to deal with that?  You might.  Joy even repeated.  You might.  Like, could you help me out here?  Help me out of here, Hendry.  I'm trying to conduct an interview here.  Go to CNN.  Please.  Yeah.  CNN, thank you, Scott S. from Quakertown.  He's reliable.  Quakertown.  One of the reliable ones.  Stories on the front page of CNN, like this is real. 
[01:08:00]  Stop.  Why?  Why?  Why does the media go along with this?  Are you kidding?  It would be like fucking putting wrestling in the sports section.  All due respect.  Well, they kind of all do respect.  They kind of do now.  Do they?  Yeah, they do.  In the sports?  Is it in the sports section?  Yes, it is.  Because the sports section is very close to the entertainment section, and it being sports  entertainment.  Sports entertainment section.  Sports entertainment section.  It's on the board.  It's on the board.  It is on the board.  It's that page that goes from sports to entertainment.  Yeah, you turn the page, and you see what's on TV, and the reviews of the new shows, and 
[01:08:30]  then you flip one back, and you see what the Mets did.  If it's not on CNN.com, I'm going to have to knock Scott S. from Quakertown down a notch.  Someone's going to get blocked.  Yes.  I'll use my computer, because I think it's a little faster than yours.  Well, here's the clip that everyone's talking about today, finally.  We get to this.  In those days, Gene Simmons was on the show.  I've heard this before from him anyway.  He claims that he had sex with 5,000 women.  Do you believe that?  At the same time? 
[01:09:00]  No.  Oh.  If that's true, wouldn't he be in traction at this point?  Yeah.  How's your back, Gene?  My back is good.  My schmeckle, not so much.  That's very nice of you to joke about it.  It's a joke.  Where are you going?  What are you doing?  It's so rude.  She's done with you.  It's so rude for you to joke about it.  I was just joking because she's a comedian.  Here, be back on.  It suits you.  Oh.  Thanks for the question.  I'm sorry.  You're blaming it on me?  Don't put this on me. 
[01:09:30]  This is all yours.  You did the entire setup.  Please come back here.  No, I know.  We joke about it, and it's not funny.  Well, I'm trying to make you feel a little more comfortable.  So it's possible that she's done with you, Gene.  How do you feel about it?  Well, I hope not.  You hope not.  Please come back.  Please come back.  Please come back.  Yeah, there's a guy that cares about his woman, right?  I hope not.  Poor Joy's put in the middle where she's got to be part of a work.  Right. 
[01:10:00]  Part of a fucking angle.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  If he cared about her, wouldn't he just, like, maybe get up now and, you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  Instead of, like, please come back.  Thank you for the question.  Please come back.  Boys.  It's sort of got the commitment thing going on.  Will you come back?  Please come back.  I don't see it.  Are you coming back?  Please come back.  Please come back.  Shannon, you want to come back?  I don't really.  She doesn't.  She's mad.  She's mad.  I'm tired.  I'm tired. 
[01:10:30]  Good setup, Joyce.  Don't blame me for this.  Well, you're...  I thought that that's what we were talking about.  We were going to talk about our new season.  See, you know, here's the problem with the person in my position.  A lot of these reality shows, you know, they're bullshit.  I don't know if it's true or not.  So I thought that this is a game.  Now it turns out that it's really true.  No, this is...  I really thought this was part of the...  No, this is actually happening to us.  The so-called reality show, Shtick.  Yeah, she's hinting at it. 
[01:11:00]  She should have unloaded, though.  Yeah, she should have said this is bullshit.  She's responsible, too, to a point.  She helped the work.  Yeah.  By saying what she said at the end there.  Yeah.  Making it believable for people that were on the fence.  Joy, you know it's a work.  Or she could be doing the whole, you know,  hey, most of these are bullshit.  You know, like, hey, I...  Uh-huh.  It's bullshit.  I think it's bullshit.  Yeah, I don't know.  Huh?  I would like to think Joy is not part of a work like that. 
[01:11:30]  Well, maybe...  But she's smart enough to know that's not fucking real.  Come on.  Come on.  You gotta think.  Yeah, you would think.  God, that's awful.  Oh, the sex man.  Oh, good.  Has the Danny clip where Gene fucking placed his hand over Danny's hands for typing  during his fucking amazing speech that he was giving.  Wasn't there a shushing, too?  Was there a shush?  Come on.  I'm talking here, and you're typing things. 
[01:12:00]  Are we done with the Joy thing?  What do you think there?  Yeah.  Come on.  It's fake.  Yeah, it's completely fake.  Joy knows it's fake.  She stepped in and helped him out, I guess.  Whatever.  Maybe she bought into it.  I don't think she bought into it.  You don't think she bought into it?  No.  Oh, that's even worse.  I think she helped these two out.  They're on her show.  She's like, ah, you know.  I'll go with it.  Yeah.  You know, we obviously would fucking, Gene would be sitting there. 
[01:12:30]  I swear to you.  I fucking swear to you.  If Gene was here today with Shannon, at this very moment, trying to sell this shit, I would  be unloading on them both, saying, stop.  Of course.  Just stop it right now and fess up that this is a complete show angle.  Hey, man.  You know, they accomplished what they wanted.  We're talking about it.  Everyone else is talking about it.  Yeah.  That's the angle they're taking for the latest season of their show.  I don't know about the fact that it's complete horse shite.  I think so. 
[01:13:00]  No, I know so.  I know so.  I'm not even going to say think, and I know so.  This is all bullshit.  It's a bunch of crap.  And I bet you even the season ends with her, like, packing her bags or something.  And him dramatically going, don't go.  Don't go.  Don't go.  I love it.  Don't go.  I will change my ways.  I will change my ways.  But then all of a sudden, it'll just be the credits, and they're like, oh, God, now we're  going to have to wait for the next season to find out what happens here. 
[01:13:30]  What?  Are you leaving?  I'm leaving.  Don't go.  Don't go.  I'm going.  Please don't leave.  I'm leaving.  Don't go.  Just for fucking ten minutes.  Them just going back and forth with their boar speak.  Oh, God.  No.  Come on, guys.  Come on.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  I know.  It stinks.  I think we can finally break, huh?  Yeah, I got to eat my sandwich.  Oh, no. 
[01:14:00]  We got the Danny clip.  Oh, right.  Danny clip.  The sex man has it.  The sex man's got it.  Why don't we listen to this?  The sex man.  Oh, Jiminy Cricket.  This is Gene Simmons on our show.  Yes.  And he really was bothered by Danny just doing a little typing.  Typing.  In the background.  Danny obviously doing something for the show.  Yeah.  Trying to pump up the show that day.  Typing.  And Gene was like, how dare you?  Type while I'm talking.  Don't do that.  This is how it went down. 
[01:14:30]  In Europe, you actually had women who were walking around the courts of Europe and actually  not making noise while I'm talking.  Like this guy's on the side going like...  Danny was typing.  Danny was looking something up on the internet.  Why are you so uptight?  No, I just want to control everything.  It's just a keyboard.  I know, but just a keyboard to you means he's getting in the way of me.  He's looking up stuff for the show.  Okay.  He's not like checking his email.  Flies buzzing around your head.  Don't bother me.  They bother me.  What?  The noises bother you? 
[01:15:00]  Well...  Does that really bother you?  At that point, I was trying to gather my thoughts and that thing right there, I think that made  me wander a little bit.  Well, how come you don't do that when he's talking?  Go ahead.  I certainly do.  Oh, my God.  All sorts of stuff happens while I'm watching the show.  Well, you let him.  Yeah, it doesn't bother us.  The dogs at my home don't bark because they're not allowed to.  You allow them to shit on your carpet.  Yeah, it's your thing.  His dogs don't bark because he doesn't allow them to?  I don't allow them to.  Can you imagine this guy's your father? 
[01:15:30]  Don't go.  I hear he raised two really, really good kids, but still.  At what price?  At what price?  Fuck him.  Fuck him and his whole family.  Can we get that out there, please?  Get the PR department on that one.  Yeah.  That's our quote today.  Work that angle.  Fuck Gene Simmons and his whole fucking family.  That's our quote today.  That's what we think.  Yeah, shit. 
[01:16:00]  Patrice O'Neill will join the program next.  Stay there.  We welcome Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  Yeah.  Talking a little bit about the NBA Finals.  I know it's quickly becoming the past, but this LeBron James thing has a lot of people 
[01:16:30]  talking.  Well, I mean, I don't think he point shaved.  I think he, I just think.  Point shaved.  Like I said, I think, you know, I use a Justice League analogy, which is if you're in the Super  Friends and a meteor is getting ready to hit the Earth, who, everybody in the Justice League  turns and looks at who?  Fucking Superman. 
[01:17:00]  But then Superman goes, what do I do?  Hey guys, I don't know what to, Superman, you're the one who can fly.  You're the one who can, who can breathe in space.  You're the one who can fly and destroy that thing.  What the fuck are you talking about?  You know, I just, I just want to be a good teammate and, and help do my part.  No, there's no part to do.  I'm Aquaman.  I, I only swim.  I'm in the water here. 
[01:17:30]  By the time it gets to me, it's too late.  I might be able to get 20,000 dolphins to jump as high as they can and try to hit the  fucking thing.  Hit the fucking thing.  But, why are you putting this pressure on me?  I'm only Superman.  But who put the pressure on him?  We did.  Not him?  No, look, man.  People say that he called, he, I don't, he just accepts King James.  I think he loves being him, but he doesn't want to be him.  He wants to stand on the outside of himself and just watch himself without dealing with 
[01:18:00]  the pressure of being him.  It's, he's a, he's too, physically, he's the greatest player to ever live.  There's no other player better than him physically.  He's six foot eight slash nine, can handle, can jump, can body as big as a horse and strong  as a horse.  But he just doesn't want, he's, he's not mean.  He's not mean enough.  Jordan used to do things to really demoralize people, demoralize people, laugh at him, close 
[01:18:30]  his eyes when he shoots free throws, uh, uh, fake you out with one hand, like a fake pass.  Larry Bird used to do that kind of shit.  Magic, they, Isaiah, they all were mean.  They were mean.  He's a nice guy and he, he wanted his rings, but he doesn't understand, you know, one ring  in Cleveland would have been 20 somewhere else.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Uh, you, you, you see the heroic, uh, God-like, uh, treatment, uh, Dirk is getting and not cause 
[01:19:00]  he's white guy.  I mean, I, I rooted for him cause he's a, he was a soldier stayed in Dallas, shitty Dallas,  seven foot bum, only shoots free throw.  I mean, shoots outside jump shots, three pointers.  Who still does that.  So if he, he's been able to do it consistently, this motherfucker is not a force of nature.  He's a, he's still the same Dirk.  He always was.  And it calls him a caveman.  It looks like, it looks like a big, it looks like a caveman.  He's a, you know, Dirk, just, just a normal, you know, that, that fucking, I'm super humble 
[01:19:30]  guy who is starting to make me sick.  This, you know, Derek Rose is that, I don't even think my mother, it's like, suck a dick.  You know, I love my mom too, nigga.  I love my mom too.  Everybody loves their mom.  That you're this humble thing.  So what'd you think about winning the game?  I'm just happy that, you know, I love my teammates and I love my mom.  Like Dirk is, you know, he, he was in, he was in, I don't want to enjoy it mode. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  So much that when he won, he didn't know what to do.  Yeah.  He had to walk away for a little while.  Shake it off.  And when he was teasing about him coughing and shit and he's like, they're just childish.  It's like, what, what happened?  This is my question for, for, uh, this is my question for life.  Now, can we say, are we retiring the phrase sticks and stones and break my bones and names 
[01:20:30]  will never hurt?  Is that now officially?  It seems like we are.  I think you're right.  Can no one, can no one be, can, is it, is it legal for me to say I endorse hate speech?  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  I, I would hate speech, but why can't I hate you in speech?  Exactly.  Why?  I don't understand.  I don't either.  Not in this country.  How avarice can any kid, look it, you know how much money it would take me to go, fuck 
[01:21:00]  you motherfucker to everybody?  Five million.  Yeah.  Five million is enough to tell, I'll tell, suck my dick.  Done.  So obviously you're getting into the Tracy Morgan thing.  I'm getting into everything.  It's all connecting.  That's what I was trying to say.  It's all around us.  It's all connected.  But the Tracy Morgan thing is the big one today.  Well, see, my thing with Tracy is this, um, I, look, I, you know, I don't fall for no  banana and no tailpipe.  I don't listen to anybody that says it. 
[01:21:30]  I believe the opposite.  I try to make the opposite opinion right away.  Yep.  Tracy's been that a long time.  Tracy's been frivolous with his performances a long time.  He say some ill shit, not just fucking gay and shit, but here's what he's doing now.  It's simple as this, man.  And the game we're in is like jail.  You gotta, you gotta be, there's no rogue, lonely, gunslinger guy in Hollywood. 
[01:22:00]  There's no, I do it myself and nobody fucks with me.  Do it my way.  My way.  It ain't none of that.  You gotta be affiliated.  Like if you go to prison, you can't go in there and go, Hey, I'm just going to read  my gun books and you know, I'm just going to chill out.  You gotta join something.  Yeah.  And if you don't join something, the guy's going to find out.  So who you, who you affiliate with?  Well, I'm just chilling up and just hanging.  I'm my own person.  I'm going to rape you.  Cause you have, cause you have no, you have no affiliations, my friend. 
[01:22:30]  Right.  You're not down with a cartel.  Oh, so what Tracy, I mean, this is conjecture, but Tracy's just paying what he owe you.  It's like, um, the Godfather, the guy goes Godfather and he goes, well, you never even  fucking say hi to me.  Yeah.  But you know what?  Here's my deal.  I'll do what you want.  And when I need you, I'm just going to come get what I need.  And he goes, yeah, it is not going to door.  And it's like, you got to pay me back.  Yeah.  Tracy owes a lot of people his career. 
[01:23:00]  Cause why do you think he could say now, trust me, people that know Tracy, he says  some ill shit that he could get in trouble like he is for every day.  This time around, he says something and they said, Oh, here's a, here's a good time.  Tracy.  Yeah.  What?  What's up?  Yeah.  You know, you can, you're in deep shit.  We don't make you apologize, but you, you owe.  And the fear that guy that when you owe is that they're going to take everything from  you.  So if, if they didn't make you, they can't really break you. 
[01:23:30]  And you see, I say they it's, it's the cartels, man.  You, you do not look at gay people have a powerful cartel.  I affiliate myself with Jews, low level to mid level Jews.  Cause they, they deal in money.  You, you, you pay them dough.  You, you, you, here's your 10.  Can I have a little, can I do my thing over here?  Pay you this?  I'm not, I'm not big enough to get in big trouble, you know?  So is it possible that I can just do this? 
[01:24:00]  Here's your dough.  And the thing I like about Jews dealing with them as a cartel is they don't want you to  be Jewish.  They, you don't have to join.  You don't have to give anything, but what you owe, you don't have to fucking, you know,  you don't have to fucking go to the parties.  You don't have to put on the yarmulke.  You don't have to do it.  So it's a very fair thing.  A lot of these cartels, man, you gotta be that. 
[01:24:30]  Gotta be in with them.  You got to be that.  And believe everything they believe in.  You got, yes.  Don't speak ill of them.  Yep.  Yep.  And, and the thing is, you know, Tracy has to pay with you.  And I knew that when Tina Fey turned on him.  Tina Fey has been his great benefactor for many years.  So this one thing has turned the tides of Tracy's career, meaning it's, it's made him 
[01:25:00]  public enemy.  Number one.  When I heard this story pass one day, I said, Tracy's the new spokesman for gay shit.  Now we said yesterday, Patrice, that they grab you as a hostage.  You don't have to be a hostage, but he's a hostage to glad right now.  And glad will let Tracy know when they're done with them.  Then they're not ever going to be done with them because it's powerful.  Look, it's corruptible, man.  You're like, when a bully takes your money, he don't go, thank you.  I just needed it today. 
[01:25:30]  He keeps going.  Tracy, Tracy, I don't know how much money he got in the bank.  He goes, but I would think it's enough to say, no, leave me alone.  Fuck you.  And he, but he sets himself up, um, where Tracy doesn't have, like, if I'm saying this, I'll,  I'll hear from Tracy, meaning, yo, don't talk shit about, shut the fuck up, nigga.  Like, don't, I'm, I'm on your side.  I know what you're going through, but I, I made a decision.  And that's why people go, well, why Patrice isn't, I don't want to owe that much. 
[01:26:00]  I don't.  Cause there's people that count on me to have a, a, a, a, like a revolutionary attitude  sometimes just where I argue.  Yeah.  So I let a lot of people down if I put myself in a position, I have to flop around on my  belly, have to be a spokesperson like that or right.  That's why I talk so much because I want people to understand what I'm saying.  Now, if I talk about gays and talk about anything I have a problem with, I'm going to make sure  if they're going to end my career, you know, that it's, it's a, it's a muscle move that is 
[01:26:30]  unfair that it's not just cause Tracy just goes faggots, faggots, faggots and more faggots.  And if my son was a faggot and then he, and then you go, Tracy, what the fuck?  He didn't say nothing to apologize for.  He, what are you apologizing for?  Yeah.  You were doing your act, but he's on a comedy stage, but the people who make you, Oh, they  go with this guy is setting himself up to, Oh, us big. 
[01:27:00]  Cause we're allowing him to feel himself.  I'm going to pull my stuff, my stomach out.  I'm going to go crazy.  I'm going to be drunk.  I'm going to fucking get DUIs.  I'm going to fall downstairs.  I'm going to get a kidney from a bitch and leave her.  I'm going to do all kinds of shit.  Holy shit.  I'm going to do all kinds of shit.  Yeah.  And then I'm, I feel like I'm invincible.  Then I do something that I do all the time.  Faggots, faggots.  And now, Oh, his benefactor, Oh, Tracy, we're, we're, we're, we're disgusted with him. 
[01:27:30]  And now they pick him up by the fucking hem of his neck and the back of his drawers and  toss him out into every gay thing.  Tracy's from the hood.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I'm going to be doing.  Tracy's from the hood.  You understand?  Yeah.  You're going to get to you.  Now the new from a guy who's just go faggots to the understanding, delicious spokesman for 
[01:28:00]  gayness.  You got to watch these motherfuckers watch TV and see the trends.  There's a commercial I hate so much.  I am a student of commercials, by the way.  I hate this commercial so much.  I don't know how to approach how much I hate it because gay also means happy.  Sure does.  Now we can play that game, but gay does mean happy.  Homosexuals have commandeered the word gay into where it's not happy anymore because there's 
[01:28:30]  a commercial because the boss of the Phoenix Suns came out the closet.  The boss of the Phoenix Suns is gay and they do a commercial where they're playing basketball  and the guy's like, hey man, you suck.  Yeah.  Hey man, you ain't nothing.  Hey man, you ain't got no jump shot.  And then one guy goes, yeah, your moves are gay.  What?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep.  And then he has some of the Phoenix Suns are the spokesman like, hey man, that's not cool 
[01:29:00]  to say that.  Gay is, what?  They don't believe that.  Motherfucker, so now, no.  Fucking moms.  Like look, here's what we all let happen.  We all, we all let context be destroyed.  Yeah.  Context is gone.  I can't slip up.  I can't say nothing.  You can't understand what, you don't feel me?  You don't feel what I'm saying? 
[01:29:30]  Look, what he did, I can't go, oh, I can defend that.  But I will say this.  Here's what happens with Tracy.  Here's what can happen.  You know, I believe in conspiracies, man.  It just sets people up who want to control everyone, right?  Where you go, okay, Tracy, you go, a guy like Tracy, he isn't qualified to have an opinion.  Having an opinion, it should be in the hands of people who are qualified intellectually. 
[01:30:00]  So guys like him, if he's not, if he don't have a degree, if you don't, they'll start making language elite where you can't, you can't have an opinion.  But I say Tracy can be as ignorant, as fucked up as he wants to be because I want to be able to communicate.  And if I'm fucked up, let me be fucked up.  But I support anything, as long as you're not hitting me and robbing me.  Hate speech, why can't I hate you? 
[01:30:30]  Why the fuck?  But see, the dilemma in my head is this.  Back in the 1910s, eight-year-old kids worked in the coal mine or whatever.  And people back then thought that it built character.  But then we go up to our age where our parents hit us.  And now we go, oh, that built character when you hit it.  So I'm saying, the point I'm making is, maybe I'm antiquated. 
[01:31:00]  Maybe I'm thinking old because I don't think kids should work in coal mines.  But I do think kids should get hit.  But now you can't even tease kids in school.  It's bullying.  Bullying, very important, yeah.  So maybe it's right.  Maybe the way the world's going is right.  Maybe no bullying.  Because my stepkid was getting bullied in school.  My instinct was, hey, you know, tell her to ball her fucking fist up and knock this other bitch in her fucking teeth. 
[01:31:30]  That's what we heard.  Her mother goes to the school, tells the principal,  No more bullying.  No more bullying.  Because bullying is gone now.  But is it right?  Is it wrong?  I don't know what's going on.  So maybe being against it is the wrong thing.  Maybe being anti the world becoming.  I saw, I'm in BJ's, I saw a box, a kitchen, toy kitchen. 
[01:32:00]  A boy was on the front.  I wanted to scream at somebody.  There's a little sissy on the box, on the toe, on the fucking easy bake oven box.  There's a boy?  You know what?  I think we're becoming our parents.  What the fuck?  You're right.  You can't wrap your head around something like that.  You can't wrap your head around that.  So you can't even be angry.  You can't quite.  Look, someone has decided that's okay now in this society. 
[01:32:30]  To put the boy on that box.  Them.  Like we answer into a them.  Yeah.  That's not even, we don't even know.  And we're not part of them.  And that's our problem.  We are part of the them.  The them is the collective.  Sure.  Who's Tracy?  Who's LeBron apologizing to?  Hey, when they wake up, man, they're going to be them.  They're going to just be them.  Look, when they wake up in the morning, you know.  So LeBron, when you said that, were you saying that you're better than people? 
[01:33:00]  He should look up in the sky for a second and go, yeah, yeah.  Because let's be honest.  I am.  I am.  Compared to them, yes, I'm better than them.  I'm 25 and worth zillions of dollars for doing something that people are right now  in the snow right now.  They moved out.  They shovel pavement.  And they built a hole in the wall.  And they're practicing shooting just to be what I actually am.  So how about this?  If I'm not liked, how about everybody suck my dick? 
[01:33:30]  I got a good accountant.  You can't get my dough.  I got some gold berries somewhere.  Y'all can suck my dick.  You can talk about my mama, too.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm six foot eight.  My dick is as long as a goddamn robo.  I probably get my dick stuck in front of my wife.  There's nothing she can do because she's a fucking loser.  But he backed off from his statement.  He should have went all in.  Of course he did.  No, I know.  I understand.  Of course he backed up from his statement.  I like this a lot.  I like it a lot. 
[01:34:00]  Because it's easy just to say that Tracy should be able to say whatever he wants on a comedy  stage.  But you really fucking painted the big picture here today, sir.  Dude, it's...  We all think that, obviously.  This business is the beast.  Yeah.  And it eats everybody and shits them out.  But here's what's funny about the beast.  It's a never-ending line of people who want to get in the mouth and get chewed up and shit  out.  Why is that?  It's because when you get in the belly, you get $2 million a week. 
[01:34:30]  And when you get shit out, you're a pile back there.  And you have the option to go get back in line and wait to go get back in the beast and  get eaten and shit out.  This motherfucker is hilarious.  And we line up.  You are fucking hilarious and profound.  I want to find where it's just a couple of dollars.  Just give me...  I just want a couple of mil.  What part of the beast do you want to be in? 
[01:35:00]  Kind of in the esophagus?  I'm not even...  Let me tell you something.  You don't want to be in the belly, right?  Let me tell you something.  I didn't even get to the beast yet because I'm 20 years.  Yeah.  See, when the beast pick you up to put you in your mouth, you shining.  People see you.  Sometimes, see what 15 minutes of fame is?  The beast goes, ooh, throws somebody down and gets...  That was reality, people.  Yeah, yeah.  But people saw him in front of the mouth. 
[01:35:30]  This one was an athlete that had one good year.  And they threw him a...  Now you see, ooh, that looks like a delicious young thing there.  Eat, chew.  That's why I love Charlie Sheen so much.  He was in the belly.  When you make it too mean a week doing anything, you're in the absolute belly.  And for that fucker to betray his position in the belly, to actually give the beast indigestion was spectacular.  He was a martyr. 
[01:36:00]  And Mel Gibson, too.  Mel Gibson.  Yeah, Mel Gibson.  He could have been the beast.  He was so big.  Yeah.  And they turned on him.  You know what I'm saying?  So anybody that gets that deep and turns on the beast, man, you got to root for him.  No matter what.  Because they're martyrs.  Because no one's going to stand up for them.  And then Hollywood, they tell you who to hate.  Like when they rose up against him to not be on Hangover 2, when Mike...  The movie was about trannies fucking people in the ass, drugs, death, and Mike Tyson who got a rape conviction. 
[01:36:30]  And you motherfuckers decide to gang up on Mel Gibson.  And say you can't be in this.  He can't play a tattoo artist in the Hangover 2?  That's pretty amazing.  Come on, man.  It's not hypocrisy.  Because that means...  That's a human thing.  It's something else.  A cartel.  It's somebody owing somebody the favor.  I was close.  I was hooked in with the Spike Lee cartel. 
[01:37:00]  He had his own baby cartel that he's connected.  But he's big enough for you to be connected to him.  But he's connected to somebody else.  And he asked me for a favor.  And I said, I can't.  Gone.  Off with the head.  What was the favor?  You're going to talk about it.  He put the most money in my pocket I've ever seen in my life up to that point.  He put me in a couple of movies, voiceovers.  He had access to a lot of things and just threw me in.  That movie I did, The 25th Hour? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  I really didn't audition for that.  He said, hey, man.  You're a Celtics fan, ain't you?  I said, yeah, man.  I'm from Boston.  He goes, all right.  You got it.  You got the gig.  Like, he saw my comedy, liked me, sat me down.  Yeah.  He said, you're in.  He just, you're in.  Put me in this movie.  Was really nice to me.  Put me in voiceover commercials and all type of shit.  I was seeing money I'd never seen before. 
[01:38:00]  And he asked me, it was some gig with, like, Showtime.  Something happened with Showtime.  But they did me real dirty.  But he was doing this movie with Showtime.  And I said, man, I can do the part.  I don't want to come read.  But I did it through my agents.  I did the right thing.  He just bypassed my agents, everybody else.  He called me personally and said, come do this.  And I go, well, how can I?  What am I going to do?  Just say, fuck my agents and fuck people that I have a business with.  If I do that, that destroys my entire system. 
[01:38:30]  I feel like I should have a system, like you have a system.  I can't.  He said, all right.  That was it.  Wow.  Damn.  That was it.  And that's how it is.  Now, I only lost what I lost.  I didn't lose fame, glory, and everything.  I only lost some money.  Yeah.  But, you know, they got motherfuckers.  You lose everything.  But, see, it's everything that you want.  You want shine.  You want to.  I sat twice up on the front row at MSG. 
[01:39:00]  My girl with me.  I think it was twice or once.  It's so intoxicating when you're in the front row.  You're looking around at who else is there, right?  Where you have to move your feet because you might trip the player.  When they threaten to take that away, you get scared.  Tracy got front row seats at MSG, man.  Wherever you go, people are screaming.  Wherever you go, he gets right in. 
[01:39:30]  And somehow, you know, if you fall from where he is, you fall way down.  Yeah.  Do we talk about Dane Cook anymore?  Dane could still sell out any theater, any 5,000-seat theater.  But the fact that it ain't Dane Cook day no more, it seems like he's done, doesn't it?  It seems like he's done.  He's not done.  No.  But it's just not his day because he had a favor he didn't pay back.  You think that's it? 
[01:40:00]  Dude, Will Smith has been famous forever.  For 15 years.  Probably longer.  15 years.  Fresh Prince is pushing 20 years ago.  He does what he's supposed to do.  And I'm not saying he, whatever.  I'm just saying, you just don't do seven pounds.  Can I?  And stay on top.  Let me play the other side of that because I'm sure a couple people would say this.  Holy shit.  A few people would say it's because he's that talented. 
[01:40:30]  Nobody's that fucking talented.  Let me tell you something.  That's what I thought you were saying.  And honestly, I agree with you.  No.  No one person is that talented.  No man, I'm not being a fucking asshole when I'm saying this.  There's no way I shouldn't be bigger than I am.  There's just no way that.  We all say it.  Joe Coy is selling out shit and I'm not.  Right.  And I like Joe.  I like Joe.  But Joe is, Joe ain't me.  Mm-hmm.  Joe ain't Nick DiPaolo.  Joe ain't everybody that did Tough Crowd. 
[01:41:00]  Right.  Gangsters.  We should be out in the public eye.  But you know why?  Nick says goo gobbler, man.  Yeah.  Nick will say goo gobbler in a minute.  Even when Nick's trying to be good, he can't.  He can't help himself.  Because he's gangster, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I try.  I swear to God I try.  But you just go, what?  Like, the first thing I think is, please, God, let Tina Fey and Wanda Sykes chastise me over some shit I said.  And I got to apologize to who, motherfucker? 
[01:41:30]  I'll die first, nigga.  Yeah.  Like, for real.  I don't motherfuckers think I be bullshitting, man.  I try.  But I'm like, I don't want to put myself in a spot to where I'm balanced.  Like, I'm telling you, I sit in my house every day and I appreciate my ceiling fan, man.  Because one day somebody's going to try to take it.  And I got to look at it and know that someday somebody's going to try to take my ceiling fan. 
[01:42:00]  And all I got to do is, you know, as hopefully I have a good woman, and she is, but I'm saying hopefully we have a good woman that when the shit hits the fan, she's going to be there.  Or you're going to have people that's going to be there that if somebody one day says, we're going to take this big mouth anthem, we're fed up with him.  We're fed up with you.  We're going to take your shit.  And you're sitting there going, wait, I own my house.  No, you don't.  We own it.  We own everything.  And that you have a place to go that, you know, where you can park your Shelby. 
[01:42:30]  You feel me?  Yeah.  So, look, I've been, I've tasted little parts of what success is.  I've tasted it.  It's good.  It's deliciously, you get drunk off of it.  Uh-huh.  But, you know, Tracy, I don't know how much money he got, but he should, he should, uh, he should be happy with the money he's got.  He should.  What I'm getting from you, though, is it's not a fear. 
[01:43:00]  That's too easy to say, of success.  You don't want to put yourself in a position where you can fall hard and hurt yourself.  You owe.  But, you owe.  And the Godfather, all, luckily, what he owed was fix my son up.  He got shot.  And you go, ooh.  But when you hear the knock on your door and he goes, I need you to do me a favor.  You're going to, you're going to be at the, uh, dinner with the president, aren't you? 
[01:43:30]  Uh, yeah.  Or, um, you're going to be at a dinner with somebody I want dead.  Right.  I want you to put this pill in his drink.  Oof.  Uh, I, I, I, I don't know.  Well, see.  Well, what you owe is we're going to kill your whole family.  I told you, I want my favor.  So you do that.  And then just, you'll get caught and maybe go to jail.  But your wife and kids, we won't blow the whole house up.  But you owe us.  And that's why you're not, you're in my debt.  When you get to a, see, I, I deal with low to middle level Jews in my career. 
[01:44:00]  Okay.  We talk, we talk shit, but if I get upgraded to the next level, okay.  Say I, I get a show on TV, say it's not, it's not too popular, but they keep, they keep  it on for me until it gets popular.  A favor?  I owe.  I fucking owe.  Something.  All right, Patrice, we need you to do a big favor.  And I'm, and I'm intoxicated.  I'm, I'm in the front row.  Everybody's like, Patrice, what's happening, baby? 
[01:44:30]  All the girls and shit.  Oh, I love fat men.  Yeah, I know you do, bitch.  Hey, listen.  I got dough for everybody.  I'm making it rain.  I'm, fuck, I got a $50 brick.  I'm throwing money in the air.  I'm getting my dick sucked.  I'm driving in a $4 million, three, six door car.  I'm driving a six door Porsche.  Faggots.  Excuse me.  I didn't mean it.  Like get fucked in the ass people, but pussy motherfuckers, you know, I'm the shit. 
[01:45:00]  And then, and then Patrice O'Neill, the shit can't get a fucking job.  Let me tell you something.  When it, when it rains, it pours punk comedians are tweeting vicious shit against Tracy punk  motherfuckers that have not would never raise their fucking mouth against Tracy scared of  him physically, scared of who he hangs with, scared of his fucking position, never say no 
[01:45:30]  shit to trade.  They're tweeting shitty Tracy comments cause they, cause the word is out.  That's how far it'll take you down where middle act comics, uh, I have the balls to speak  up against Tracy.  And that's cause the word is out.  The word is out.  Cause I know these motherfuckers are pussies, man.  Nobody got balls to stand up to Mel Gibson, Braveheart, fucking Passion of the Christ, all  the fucking lethal weapon movies, all the fucking Mad Max movies. 
[01:46:00]  You think fucking Zach Galifianakis on his own said, fuck Mel Gibson.  He got permission.  That's this business.  Jesus Christ.  That's this business.  Motherfuckers think the motherfucker, you think I'm fucking playing?  And the, and those middle, and those middle, uh, comics, they just, yeah, they just waited  until the coast was clear.  Who the fuck is going to stand up against Tracy?  Those are people that hated Tracy and they think now he's, he's done. 
[01:46:30]  And now I'm going to talk shit on Twitter about Tracy Morgan.  Can I say that?  I have to say we're, I'm proud to say that we jumped right on the Tracy should be able  to do what he did.  Bandwagon.  And I want to say that today.  Yeah.  It sounds like we're self-serving, but it's like, that is the thing to do.  Why?  You don't wait for other people and get in, and then finally either decide to or not  to, what is, what are you feeling in your heart and go with it immediately?  But it's not that easy.  I know it's not.  That's a human level.  That's why me and aunt and Jimmy, we yell and scream on a daily basis here. 
[01:47:00]  Cause it's really fucking frustrating to be in this position.  It's like, why isn't it every comic coming out and going, yeah, he should be able to do  this on a comedy stage.  And they got people who supported him.  Yeah.  Didn't flip it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tracy should be able to say, Oh no, wait.  I read it.  No, you know, I know.  I want to say the name.  Well, you know what?  Chris Rock.  It was Chris Rock.  I was shocked by that.  He said, boom, boom.  He immediately went to defending him.  Then he went immediately to saying, fuck you. 
[01:47:30]  Turn it around.  It has nothing to do with all the context.  Fuck the context.  Because anything I say, or you say, they can flip it around and use it against you.  Well, they have.  But I should be able to say anything I fucking want.  Look, I should be able to say something about gays.  Look, I said something on a podcast I did a long time ago.  Or my whatever, whatever they call it, that little show I would do.  And I was playing the president.  The president. 
[01:48:00]  And I go, why is being gay of preference and tying a bitch up and peeing on her a fetish?  Yeah.  Why is who I decide to fuck some type of profound fight?  I just want to have that discussion.  Because I'm here to say, look, it's not about love.  Because I can go, man, I love you, man.  I love you, too, man.  Brotherly.  I love you.  I love a man.  But it ain't gay until I'm fucking you. 
[01:48:30]  I love my dog.  I love my dog.  But it's not bestiality.  Unless I'm fucking my dog.  Until you start fucking.  So if I fucking have a crush on you and I never tell you, I'm not gay.  Right.  I'm just.  And in fact, we invented a thing called man crush.  That says a heterosexual man who looks at another man with some type of reverence.  But he's not fucking him.  Yeah.  Why can't you talk about this situation?  What do you want? 
[01:49:00]  You know what?  Define to me what it is.  What are you asking for?  To get married?  No.  No.  What's coming out the closet?  Coming out the closet so I can let everybody know and see here's the thing.  I don't give a fuck.  But I'm saying, look, let's say I like tying bitches up and peeing on them.  Right.  I want to be able to show everybody.  By some type of flag, some type of gesture that I want to. 
[01:49:30]  I'm tired of hiding that I like peeing on bitches.  I'm tired.  I want everybody to know because I don't want to live this way no more.  I want you to know that I like to do that.  And there are other people that like to do it, too.  That other people like to do it.  And I want to get together with those people and share our experiences.  And I want to fight for our right to pee on each other.  And I want to fight to get married to a person under the guise that I like peeing on somebody.  Now, if I'm saying some fucked up shit, please talk to me. 
[01:50:00]  Make me see different because I don't give a fuck.  Be gay.  But it's forcing me.  I can't say nothing.  I can't say shit.  No, you can't.  And no one will have that conversation with you.  You will be fucking chastised.  I'm ostracised.  Chast, I'm homophobic.  I'm not homophobic.  Look it.  Here's my stance on abortion.  Kill your baby if you want.  But don't say it's your body, bitch. 
[01:50:30]  It ain't your body.  You're not special.  It's because God, science, whatever you believe in, just because you're the apartment building for the baby doesn't make you special.  You're not special.  The entire baby process is special.  But you were chosen because whether by eeny, meeny, miny, moe, rock, paper, scissors, a flip of the coin, that's where the baby be.  It's you.  But am I going to fucking burn abortion clinic down? 
[01:51:00]  No.  Right.  But I'm just saying I have an opinion about it.  I have a fucking opinion about it.  And I'm not saying kill gays and gays can't.  But I'm saying what are you making me think?  You're comparing black to gay?  I can't not be black.  What if I don't want to?  I'm black.  But people do say that there's no choice in being gay.  It doesn't matter.  They can't stop being gay.  It doesn't matter.  It's still something that you're telling me that you want me to accept your sexual orientation. 
[01:51:30]  That means everybody's sexual thing should be accepted.  Everybody who's in the bondage should be able to walk around tied up.  Like, if a guy likes to tie up his wife, they should be able to walk around with handcuffs and a big harpoon with handcuffs and walk around because they want to express.  With no one being shocked about it.  With no one.  Now, that's what I'm saying. 
[01:52:00]  But say what it is.  Don't make me go along with your agenda based on it.  People are mistaking opinion and discussion with hate and telling people that you can go out and hurt these people.  No.  You just have an opinion on something and you want to openly discuss it, but you can't.  You can in this society.  Because I have an opinion.  See, legislating feelings is... 
[01:52:30]  I don't want white people to like me if they don't.  Don't force them.  Don't force...  Don't force...  Don't.  Don't make white people like me.  You know, but listen, I agree.  Don't put your hands on me.  Don't beat on me.  Yeah.  I'm not suggesting that.  I'm only suggesting I have a theory about homosexuality.  A theory.  Yeah.  I'm not homophobic.  I don't want them dead. 
[01:53:00]  Matter of fact, I live in New York City.  I mean, you know, in the area.  Yeah.  Gayness doesn't fucking bother me.  No.  And for most guys, gayness doesn't bother them.  Gay guys bother them.  Gay women are fun.  You gay, baby?  Good news.  You got a little bit of not gay in you?  Because I want to just...  Be a part of that.  Yeah.  Maybe put my finger in your asshole, baby.  But it's like...  It's like, can we talk about it? 
[01:53:30]  Without you saying I'm a fucking...  I'm an anti-this and a fucking that?  Man, stop.  It's scary.  It's deflating.  It makes me furious, man.  It makes me furious because you feel lonely and you feel helpless because you know you  have to deal with this shit to make it in this business.  And I got in this business because I was a funny kid.  And then I found out what comedy was and it ain't funny. 
[01:54:00]  And I'm like, it tricked me.  It tricked me.  I thought it was just fun and games and I get paid.  It's everything you learn about the business that ain't the fun, it takes a little bit out of you.  Because to balance, for me to be a good businessman, for me to be a good businessman, I have to take away from my innocence.  Because being a good businessman means you got to be an awful motherfucker.  You can't be loyal.  You can't be good to...  You have to be able to chop heads, man.  And it's sad because I want to have friends. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, you just want to have fun and...  You just nailed it.  When we're here from 6 to 10, this is unbelievable.  This is the greatest thing that you could do.  But everything around it is such a drag and it does start eating away at you.  And it shouldn't be like that.  We don't need any fucking bosses.  Trust me.  We know what the fuck we're doing.  At this point, we don't even need a company behind us because of the shit that comes with that. 
[01:55:00]  And you would love to not have a company behind you.  We joke about it, but...  And people beat us up for this, but we're dead serious when we tell our listeners that when 10 o'clock comes, even though we go past 10,  but let's say when the show is officially over, we can't get out of here fast enough because we don't want to rot anymore.  You stay around here long enough, it rots you.  And people go, oh, that means you don't care about the show.  No, you have no idea what the fuck happens as soon as the show ends.  When you're dealing with...  When you have humanity and you see that you're in a game where humanity, you're an idiot for having a dignity or just a philosophy that you live by. 
[01:55:30]  An individuality.  You're an idiot.  Loyalty in this business.  Oh, my God.  If you're loyal to someone in this business, you're a fucking idiot.  Anything you do that makes you a decent person normally, in theory, in show business, you're... 
[01:56:00]  Look, and I'm fucked up.  I talk a lot of shit, but I have nothing to fall back on.  I've been doing this shit 20 years.  Because I'm hoping I don't open my mouth enough where I can't do a gig in Utah for a couple of bucks so I can fucking keep my ceiling fan turning off.  Other than that, that big, crazy money, people think, oh, he's miserable.  I'm not...  I'm just...  It's scary, dude. 
[01:56:30]  It's scary.  Good job, Patrice.  I get them shakes when white people, old white people say great job.  I'm not...  Good job, Patrice.  You're supposed to hate me.  I'm anti-you.  Now I'm in this party, this free sushi, free...  You know, some pretty white girl is going, hi, I saw you special.  And you go, you idiot.  You know, but, you know, you can't do that shit.  You got to go, hello, how are you?  And that's... 
[01:57:00]  Look, ultimately, that's what Tracy did.  Tracy thought it was all for free.  He didn't understand, dude, that it's not for free.  Like I said, I use prison analysis.  If you go into prison, I'm telling you, if you ever get locked up and say your money  ain't coming for a couple of days, your clothes ain't coming for, and you didn't eat for a  couple of days, just don't eat.  Because if somebody goes, hey, man, I see you in trouble, man.  I got some Twix and a bar of soap for you and some socks.  Oh, hey, thanks.  Oh, thanks, guy. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, that's great.  Three days later, hey, man, I need 17 more socks.  I need 17...  No, I didn't tell you about the percentage.  I need 12 Twix and one Snickers, and I need socks, drawers, and sneakers from you.  Yeah, but you didn't tell me about that when you gave it to me.  Ah, turn around.  Like American me, you get a knife in your asshole on a bag of rice.  Oh, shit.  And that's the game.  That is.  It is what it is.  See, but see, the perception, the last thing I'm going to say, a lot of people carry themselves 
[01:58:00]  in the perception in which they think the business sees them.  So they have confidence when they think the business thinks they're the shit, and they  have nothing when the business thinks they're nothing.  So when I talk, of course people say, fuck that fat ass, oh, fuck it.  And they'll be ready to go at me because their perception is I'm not big enough in the business  to be scared of.  But I earn my respect based on me.  So I don't owe.  So I can go back, back and forth. 
[01:58:30]  So if I say Tina Fey's name, I'm not calling out Tina Fey.  That bitch is powerful.  But I'm saying, bow down and say sorry to me for something you said.  But Tracy's big problem, he didn't mean what he said.  He just says things frivolously.  Right.  And he had no defense for himself because it came out with no meaning.  He didn't say it for a reason.  Me, if I say I don't like Chinese people, I don't say.  If I say, hey, listen, there's my issue with homosexuality. 
[01:59:00]  Talk to me, motherfucker.  I'll talk to you about it.  And if you can convince, I'm a fair motherfucker.  Convince me of what I'm saying is to be wrong.  And I'll go, you know what?  I'm sorry.  Because I'm sorry comes from, it's like the bill collectors when they go, sorry, sir.  Wait, wait.  Don't say you're sorry.  You didn't do nothing.  And you don't even have an ability to be sorry.  You're doing what you're told to do.  I made a statement that I believe.  If you don't believe what I say, let's talk about it.  And if you can convince me I'm wrong, then I go, I apologize, man. 
[01:59:30]  You made me see different.  That's what an apology is.  Not, I'm sorry, I fucking said faggot 80 times.  And you caught me.  When I have to deal with people on the phone and they start with that sorry shit, immediately  I go, don't say sorry because you don't mean it.  Let's get this.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's understand each other.  Sorry, sir.  I'm sorry.  Really?  I go, no, you're not sorry.  You don't understand.  Because if you're sorry, then you would see it my way.  And then this would be the end of the conversation. 
[02:00:00]  Sorry, sir.  That one drives me fucking nuts.  I'm sorry.  And I call him out every time now.  Don't say sorry.  You're not sorry.  You're doing your job.  Yes.  Sorry what?  What is your, the way you're talking though, it doesn't seem like you then have a goal or  anywhere you want to be.  You're like a status quo.  He's torn a little bit.  He's torn a little bit.  He's torn a little bit.  I think Patrice is torn.  Like you're in the wrong fucking business, obviously.  It's fucked up because here's what I want to do.  I'm going to tell you what I love. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  This is why.  Yo, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Before you answer that.  Yeah.  I think what Patrice is saying, a lot of other people could understand in other businesses,  by the way.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This is not just the entertainment business.  That's why this is a great, great hour with Patrice.  There are people doing just regular office jobs that have to deal with a lot of this shit on a different  level.  Well, cops, when you see the guy that fight against the blue silence, and they're like,  man, why are you abusing this? 
[02:01:00]  Why are you, you know, somebody driving around, he's like, niggas and fucking speaks.  And he's like, why are you doing this to these people?  And he's like, what are you fucking rookie?  What are you, a homosexual, Thaler?  What about just in the corporate world, in an office, you see the guy, I'm talking to a  lot of people right now, you see the guy that got the promotion over you, you know  you're better, but he was playing the fucking game.  Simple as that.  He did what he had to do.  He played those dumb things that you just don't want to do.  And you're an idiot. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  For not doing it that way.  But you truly are an idiot, because that's the game you're in.  You're fucked up by not being what that other guy was.  So you picked the game, but I didn't pick this game based on what I find out it is.  I picked it on the fact that I was a funny kid.  And what you said is, my goal is to somehow have an ability to reach out to whoever wants 
[02:02:00]  to listen, and I get money for it.  Somehow.  I don't know how to do that, which is people who just agree or not agree, but they get  to hear another side.  And I can, I don't have to worry about apologizing every five minutes.  I don't have to worry about the police kicking.  All I have to do is worry about whether someone agrees with me or not, because I'm not a frivolous  guy.  I don't just, like, say this to get effect.  I believe it. 
[02:02:30]  It hurts.  It hurts my heart.  What kind of job is that?  Like, what?  Nothing.  What do you do?  But I found out in 2011.  I, I'm 41.  Yeah.  I started when I was 22, and my dick got fully hard.  Now I'm 41.  I got to smack it a couple of times.  I wanted to be a pimp.  Now I look at my girl, I go, hand me my pills, sweetie.  Thank you.  Oh, fuck.  I, you get tired, and it's like, you know, I got one, I got a couple of more years of 
[02:03:00]  boxing, of fighting, but I do want to be able to say something against the status quo without  losing everything I have, without losing everything I have.  But you're not, you're not really putting yourself in any position to lose anything.  You're, you're, well, you.  Let me ask you a question.  Yeah.  You, when, when I come on a show, I've been, what, 10 years?  Yeah, probably.  10, 8? 
[02:03:30]  Do I give you good radio?  No.  Fuck yeah.  Of course you do.  But I'm saying.  Of course.  Give you good radio.  Mm-hmm.  That's putting myself in a position to do well.  That, that's what I'm saying.  I do the work.  Okay, so you do, all right.  See, I just want to square that, because.  Elephant in the room puts me in that position.  Right.  But what doesn't put me in that position is I got a call from a guy.  He'll, he'll, he'll stay nameless.  He goes, man, I got this role I want, I want you to do. 
[02:04:00]  But can you not be you, but be you?  Hmm.  I go, what are you, fuck?  I knew what he meant, but I want him to say it.  So you're saying, you think that you can get everything good out of me without getting  no bad.  The reason you think I'm good is because of the bad part.  It's, it's, it's an entirety.  So that's why it's like, let's find a Patrice.  Like I've seen breakdowns.  I've been in there where, uh, I see something for, for radio in Dallas. 
[02:04:30]  We want a Patrice type, Patrice O'Neal type.  Yeah.  But they just don't, they don't want to deal with my head issues.  Like they want to deal with just the fact that I'm, that I'm funny.  People agree with what I would say, but they, but it's, it's too, whatever, you know, but  I'm saying I'm doing the work.  I'm on the show, having a good people listening and people like, you know, when we're, when  we're doing it and the synergy and everything.  But then, but then it seems like, all right, so you're doing the work, you put the work 
[02:05:00]  in.  Yes.  Then when the offer comes in to take it to the next level, you need absolute Patrice  perfection.  Your mind has to look at this, study the offer and be like, I don't want any risks.  I don't want to be in indebted to anybody.  I don't want no risk.  And that doesn't risk is wrong.  Yeah.  And an indebted, indebted is wrong.  Indebted is what I'm saying is debt is when you get something for free, but you owe like, 
[02:05:30]  so, Hey man, here's a loan.  Oh, I got the money, but there's a, something else.  If I feel like, listen, this reward is worth what, what, and I put myself in a position  where I am not going to have to go belly up because my risk is, this is my risk.  Look, I, I know it's very difficult.  Somehow I'm still in the business being who I am, a giant nigga with a big mouth, not good. 
[02:06:00]  Okay.  Somehow there's a market for that somewhere, but the market is, it's like the difference  between you go to a party and you have a marijuana in your pocket or if you have heroin in your  pocket, if you have marijuana, you go, everybody, you smoke, you want some weed?  People go, nah, I don't want them, but you can smoke it right here.  If you want, don't bother me.  You go, I got some heroin.  Motherfuckers go, I do it, but you don't fucking pull heroin out.  So basically what I'm saying is, um, there's a market for me with the people, but it's not 
[02:06:30]  a market for me with the, the, the thing, the, the thing I want it.  I want the risk.  The risk is I have an opinion that can be challenged by status quo.  And then I can fight.  That's my risk.  Why should my risk?  I'm not afraid of shit.  I'm it's, it's the fact of dude, you deal with these people up here. 
[02:07:00]  They say things to you and you got to keep your job.  But a lot of the shit, it's a lot to do with the money and the, and the things you have  that you want to keep good.  So you deal with a little bit and I've dealt with some little shit here and then I dealt  with, but I go, you know what?  So here's what I don't want to do.  I don't want to, people go to office.  I go, man, I don't want to be on a show where I give 18 hours of my life and I don't give  half ass.  I give my piece of me when I'm doing stuff and it possibly, they could use it or not 
[02:07:30]  depending on how they feel.  I don't have the energy for that.  So if I'm going to fight, I'm a fight to be the H N I C. I'm a fight to be able to say  what the fuck I want to say and know it's going to be there.  And, and that's what I want to fight for.  But see, the risk is trying to be me in this business.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, my risk is this.  My risk is opening my fucking mouth.  It's risky.  It's a risky thing.  Yeah.  So I'm not afraid of nothing. 
[02:08:00]  I just don't want to be at a party and somebody goes, Patrice, here, try this.  What is it?  It'll, it'll make you feel better.  I don't drink shit that makes me feel better.  Motherfucker.  I listen, um, the party's over for you.  The party is over.  So I want to go in knowing, look, man, my deal.  And this is why I mess with Jews.  I make 10,000, you get 1,000 and a tip. 
[02:08:30]  And thank you.  We eat, laugh.  I want to make my money, say what I want.  And as long as I'm making my money, you leave me alone.  Are we square?  Bam.  Are we square?  Bam.  Bam.  Just like the mob.  You a good earner, you live.  I just want to be a good earner and say what the fuck I want to say.  What else am I going to do?  I have fun on this show.  We talk shit.  That's what I do well.  It's embarrassing to say. 
[02:09:00]  We've been trying for years to have you have your own radio show.  And it's just not happening.  No.  It's just not fucking happening.  We've thrown your name to these guys a million fucking times.  And they know.  A million fucking times.  You guys have an access to great comedians.  And I don't, of course, great comedians.  And I don't understand why they're not fucking biting.  Because.  I don't get it.  You know why?  They know.  First of all, they don't want to come up with money for anybody.  That's the first thing.  You know.  But Nick.  It does cost a little bit.  Nick.  Nick.  They know. 
[02:09:30]  Listen.  They can't control you.  When you don't have nothing.  Mm-hmm.  Look.  They can't control you if you.  The way that you control a motherfucker that don't got nothing is you give them something.  And then you hold that something over their heads.  Right.  It is what it is.  And without.  That's exactly it, man.  Without naming names.  This place, Sirius XM, is filled with a lot of shitty shows that they pay very well.  And then we come to them with, hey, you know, there was a time they want to fill up this channel with some names and stuff. 
[02:10:00]  I'm like, but Patrice O'Neal is on, I swear to you, I'm not saying it because you're here, you're on the top of the fucking list.  I've said it until I'm blue in the face.  You know, nothing has happened.  We almost had something going when we were just XM, almost.  It was on its way, right?  Yeah, Blackfell, it was fun.  And it was ready to go to the next level, but it just never did.  But here's the thing, but whoever's saying, well, isn't he talented?  What you just said will tell you the thing.  You have some really mundane motherfuckers walking around. 
[02:10:30]  And I'm going to bring in one racial aspect of it.  This is another thing.  You can't be a mediocre black guy and have a job.  That's why I said when racism's over is when you could be just mundane and have a job.  Whether you hate Obama or not, he's a spectacular dude.  He's like, you cannot watch him.  The way he walks, the way he is. 
[02:11:00]  So the hatred and vitriol motherfuckers have for him is based on his spectacularness.  You can't have a normal, regular dude.  Look it, man.  For me to be on the radio and make $500 a week, that's, you know what kind of bargain that is?  Somebody might go, man, you're crazy.  You should do it.  Dude, I shouldn't have to work this hard.  How do you explain those fucking fat traffic bitches then?  They got jobs and they're real mediocre. 
[02:11:30]  TSA workers, that's a trick to do is put mediocre people in a power position because they are willing to subjugate you because they're not elite.  They don't have respect.  That's why when you put women in certain power and weak people in power, they're the best people to have in power because they get to look at you with confidence.  And a fucking, you know, you can carry a weapon on you and you can, you can do things. 
[02:12:00]  You're on the right.  And they go, I'm going to make your life miserable because I suck.  That's why the media is going after LeBron.  Who's attacking LeBron?  Short, bald nothings who are jealous of him.  You give them a position where you can affect a powerhouse like him.  And you think they're prepared for that?  They're not.  That's why mediocre people, they do that so they can control them.  You know, but really, the only thing that scares me is, look, if somehow it rains some money and I just could be comfortable that, you know, my mom's getting, you know, sicker and sicker and I can take care of her. 
[02:12:30]  My woman get her shit and I can pay and keep him stealing fan.  I'll fucking do some free shit at my house.  Yeah.  I'll go on the thing and just talk shit about.  That's why I respect Alex Jones.  This motherfucker is a soldier.  I don't give a fuck if you don't like him or not.  He is, he has the energy to do what he's doing. 
[02:13:00]  And I would do that if, but dough is important.  Yeah, yeah, obviously.  Dough is important.  You can't be homeless.  It's important to every single person alive.  Jesus, that's what I'm saying.  But to make that funny money, dude, you know, you look at, look, I go like this.  I had an argument with somebody.  I said, how the fuck is Ellen DeGeneres?  When does she become the moral compass?  She's a bull.  She's strapping on.  And are you telling me a big mouth nigga ain't got no opportunity? 
[02:13:30]  Somehow the people who make things happen, they can influence anybody's thought process.  So I want to be in a position where I can just influence thought thinking without being attacked by a cartel that can just tell you, you're a fucking, you're a homophobe or you're anti-Semite.  You're a racist.  You're this and you hate women.  Motherfucker. 
[02:14:00]  So what?  Yeah.  I don't think you're ever going to see that, though.  Unfortunately.  I mean, it'd be great, but that's, you're talking about some kind of fucking paradise.  It's getting worse.  It's getting worse and worse.  Ellen DeGeneres has to fucking suck fucking dick, you know, figuratively speaking.  You know, she's horrified by the dick, but she's got to fucking get down and suck some dick to keep that position that she's in.  Because she likes her fucking $20 million mansion out there in Hollywood.  Didn't say I wouldn't suck a dick, figuratively.  Right. 
[02:14:30]  I've had sucked a dick.  We've all tapped.  We've all sucked a figuratively dick.  There's no way I haven't tapped.  But it's, it's, it's, what I'm saying is like, okay.  Years ago, they offered me like a hundred something thousand to do Celebrity Fit Club.  Mm-hmm.  I said, I would love to do that for the health and the money, but it's not for the health or the money.  Celebrity Fit Club are people who used to be relevant that became fat has-beens.  Mm-hmm.  Now they are coming as a, they're presenting themselves as fat has-beens under the lie of health. 
[02:15:00]  Because they all go back to being fat has-beens.  I said, I haven't even been a me yet.  I can't do a fat has-been show when I'm not a fat has-been.  Well, you could just, it's like people go, man, just going backwards, man, take it in the ass.  And then when things, when things go your way, you could go, yeah, fuck you.  Yeah.  No, man, two million dollars to CBS is ass-wiping, it's to do research on how to make 10 million. 
[02:15:30]  It don't mean nothing.  People like Charlie Sheen, two million.  Two million of Charlie's great, but two million of CBS is nothing.  And you think that you can hold these people hostage?  They don't give a fuck because corporations kill us.  Mm-hmm.  They don't give a fuck.  So I'm just trying to find my place where I'm sitting over there and people go, oh, Patrice. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  That's it.  I can talk shit and whoever wants to listen, they listen and enjoy.  You know, like my tweets.  When I tweet, I try to tweet a nice tweet.  I don't frivolously tweet.  Oh, better tweet on this.  I tweet shit.  Yeah, when you feel-  I tweet when I think it's necessary to tweet.  I tweet when I'm feeling tweetable.  With that, it's big mama prods.  We should go to break, man.  That was-  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you summarized the whole fucking thing, man.  Holy shit. 
[02:16:30]  That's a-  Wow.  It's a life lesson right there today.  The perspective.  Remember last time you were in, you were singing the blues?  Oh, shit.  With Warren Haynes?  I want to play that today.  That was good, man.  I thought you pulled it off, man.  That was embarrassing and fun at the same time.  It was a moment.  It was cool.  Are you promoting anything, Patrice?  Yes.  Oh, shit.  Actually, yes.  Caroline's.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm at Caroline's one night.  Tomorrow night?  Tomorrow night.  Just one night.  And, you know, that's it.  Awesome.  And it's not a big weekend. 
[02:17:00]  It's just one night.  Eight o'clock show, one night to see Patrice at Caroline's.  212-757-4100.  Full set.  Full set.  Get your tickets now, because this thing will sell out.  Here's Patrice O'Neill with Warren Haynes.  All right.  This is a little weird.  It's going to be Patrice O'Neill and Warren Haynes.  Man.  This is all spoken.  Man.  You know I've been enjoying things that kings and queens will never have.  In fact, kings and queens can never get. 
[02:17:30]  And they don't even know about it.  In good times.  Great googly moogly.  Great googly moogly.  I have had my fun.  If I never get well no more.  I have had my fun. 
[02:18:00]  If I never get well no more.  Oh, my health is fading on me.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going down slow.  Now, look at here. 
[02:18:30]  I did not say I was a millionaire.  But I said I've had spent more money than a millionaire.  Because if I had kept all my money that I already spent, I would have been a millionaire a long time ago.  And women, ooh, women.  Great googly moogly. 
[02:19:00]  Please write my mama.  Tell her the shape I'm in.  Tell her to pray for me. 
[02:19:30]  Forgive me for my sin.  That's all right.  Patrice, that's all right.  That's Hollywood.  You got to listen to Hollywood, though, man.  I love this song.  You got a voice on you, Patrice.  I'm going down slow. 
[02:20:00]  You just tell my mama I love it.  I'm out of here.  Sirius XM, you're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  Whether or not you're paying attention is another question.  Hanging with Patrice O'Neal.  I just checked my Twitter, and everyone's like, man, I want to follow Patrice.  So it's Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  All capital letters. 
[02:20:30]  That's our Patrice.  Just loud on Twitter, even.  Everything has to just be loud.  What are you yelling for?  Stop yelling.  Big Mama Prods.  All capital letters.  Stop yelling.  I know this is old, but did y'all give a big round of applause to the greatest side bitch  of all time?  Oh, what?  For Great Mildred?  That's...  I hope you did, you know?  That's Arnold's.  Arnold's, yeah.  I'm just making sure that y'all understand that she's the ultimate side bitch in the history 
[02:21:00]  of all side bitches.  She kept her fucking mouth shut.  Fuck.  She's the queen of side bitches.  Took a pinch like a man.  She didn't talk.  What?  God, she hugged me, but you go...  How did that story get out?  When the kids started getting older and older and looked just like Arnold, that she couldn't  say no anymore?  Like a Puerto Rican Arnold Schwarzenegger.  I know.  That's hilarious.  He's got the same fucking face.  Is that disturbing?  That really is.  I was saying it before the show.  He's even got the same teeth and everything.  The same jaw.  The same jawline.  Everything.  Yep.  A bunch of kids just speaking Spanish and then everything ends in Schwarzenegger. 
[02:21:30]  Like...  He made me...  He made me...  He made me...  He made me...  He made me...  He made me...  He made me...  He made me...  He made me...  He made me...  He made me...  He made me...  He's lifting couches as a toddler.  All the signs were there.  I just...  I just...  I just looked at her.  I just...  Fucking...  Goddamn...  That girl.  That lady.  Yep.  I was just talking to Patrice about Hangover 2.  You saw the movie, obviously.  It was alright.  Not as good as the first.  It's definitely a drop off.  It's gonna be a...  It was a huge hit. 
[02:22:00]  Not money-wise.  I said it was a...  I said it was gonna be a master hit, but...  And three is gonna be...  It's a...  It's a...  It's a...  But you know what Hollywood does?  When they don't...  When they don't feel confident about their movie, they film it somewhere else.  In an exotic place.  So you have cool, exotic shit to look at.  That distracts you from the story and the material.  To be fair, where would the next one be?  It's the same thing with New York?  Vegas again?  They gotta...  I honestly thought that was the best thing about the movie, is the Thailand backdrop. 
[02:22:30]  It's so gritty.  I really think that's a trick that Hollywood uses, though.  They go away exotic.  Well, with Sex and the City, they threw them in fucking Egypt.  There's some shit.  Sex and the City's a perfect one.  For those old hags to fucking go to Egypt.  Yeah.  They knew they had a shitty movie, but like, hey, let's throw the bitches on camels in the  middle of the desert, and you see the pyramids at least.  So that's a shark jump we should look out for.  I think so.  It's a theory.  I can't argue with that.  It's a theory.  The location, yeah.  Change the location.  Maybe Hangover 2, you're right.  Where else would they go?  So maybe it doesn't work as well.  I thought they had a pretty good look, man. 
[02:23:00]  I really did.  And I thought...  I thought Ken Jeong was funny as hell, man.  I think that fucking Ed Helms is the go-to guy in that movie, man.  Like Ed Helms.  Ed Helms is...  His thing keeps it all together to me.  I think he's hilarious.  I haven't seen the second one yet.  The first one, though.  Yeah.  They were all in.  Yeah.  Yeah, the material was edgy.  Mike Tyson at the end was so uncomfortable.  Oh, man.  Not in a good way, either.  Do you understand how painful it is to see Mike Tyson as the goofball?  Because I never was a guy who subscribed to, he's a bully. 
[02:23:30]  How is it that you knock people out and I knock people out for a living and I'm a bully?  I'm fighting you.  Bullies, they don't fight.  He knocked out other muscular men.  Why?  You know, I never got that.  Mike, he's a bully.  I'm supposed to look at you angry before I fight you.  Yeah.  You're supposed to kick your ass.  And now he's, he's a dancing, singing fool. 
[02:24:00]  You gotta say fool.  They turned him into, like, Mighty Joe Young.  How bad does he want to be famous?  Oh, yo.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fucking.  I didn't just hit me, man.  Were you fucking stuck?  Come on, man.  That's pretty funny.  That was so fucking fucked up.  You're saying some guy that's, that's all powerful.  Come on, man.  That's pretty funny.  You guys are powerful and shit. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, my God.  And then he's skating with some bitch on some fucking pond in Central Park.  Funny is funny, brother.  That's bullshit.  That's Mike Tyson.  That just hit me.  Mighty Joe Young, man.  Yeah.  That guy was all powerful.  What did he do to him?  And then he's skating on that ice thing with that bitch.  Oh, falling on his ass.  Oh, look at me.  Good question.  What did they do to him?  He used to knock out guys.  Yeah.  Like an animal.  And now he's singing One Night in Bangkok at the end of a fucking comedy because they  realized, oh, shit, we didn't put him in the movie yet. 
[02:25:00]  Here's something for you.  He's in the last 60 seconds of the movie yet.  That's it.  Yeah.  In the first one, he was kind of right in the middle there, you know?  They said, I think the credits were rolling over his face as they were allowing him to  make a fool of himself.  Oh, is he the credits guy?  I hate that.  It was a big surprise for the, look, if you haven't seen the movie, whatever, yeah.  It wasn't a bad movie, though, I have to say.  It was better than I thought it would be.  There's definitely a drop off from the first one. 
[02:25:30]  Because it was the excitement, the surprise in the first one.  Right, yeah.  But this one is no surprise, but I think they lived up to.  They redid the first movie in Thailand, basically.  Absolutely.  And they're saying that the tattoo, Ed Helms' tattoo, the Mike Tyson tattoo, they're going  to take that out when they make their Blu-rays.  Really?  Because of the...  The dude is pissed off.  Yeah, but they told that dude to fuck himself.  It's a wrap, I think.  Yeah, like...  He didn't get his dough.  He didn't get his dough, so he's pissed off. 
[02:26:00]  He wants to sue, so they're like, fuck the lawsuit.  No, no, that's done.  So why are they taking it out of the Blu-rays?  Maybe that was part of the bargain.  It might be a...  Maybe that's part of the settlement?  Maybe.  But they didn't give him nothing.  Oh, shit.  They didn't give him nothing.  I thought he had a good case.  I do, I thought so.  I guess it was an original piece of art or something.  I would have fucking...  We're like, why not pay that motherfucker?  Just give him a few bucks.  You know how much money that...  When you see what that movie grows on its opening weekend, it's already up to, what, $215 million?  They can't throw the guy a few grand or something? 
[02:26:30]  Just like, ah, here you go.  I think it's a great franchise, because the next one, who gets lost, how do they do, and  what do they do?  Yeah.  I think the next one's in Amsterdam.  Yeah.  So...  But if they get tricked for the third time, where they have to run all over the city when  the answer's right in front of them...  Oh, no.  Could he at least change that?  He was in the red light hooker's pussy the whole time.  Right.  How do you...  Golly gee.  Two movies in a row. 
[02:27:00]  Two movies in a row, they're searching all over the fucking place, and they never had  to leave the hotel.  But that's the...  You know what?  If they do that for a third time...  Why do they change it?  Now the third time, everybody's going to go, oh, he's fucking over here.  He's going to be in the closet the whole time.  He's under the bed.  We didn't have to leave the room.  But this time, they're going to trick us.  He's in England.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  I miss Patrice. 
[02:27:30]  So, Patrice, I've got to get your take on this.  Are you following any of the Casey Anthony trial?  A little bit.  Yeah.  Because they're trying to make it a big deal.  Yeah, yeah.  Like a really big deal.  Yeah.  But my thing is, it seems, you know, like she's being public opinion to put in jail before...  Oh, yeah.  ...before actual evidence.  I've never seen a trial where the news people that are supposed to be covering this are so  prejudiced against them.  Against them.  Now, obviously, look...  It looks like she's pretty fucking guilty. 
[02:28:00]  I don't think they can prove it.  But that's not the point.  Right.  And look, in this world, all I want is, like, if you're going to fake that I have this amazing  freedom...  That right, yeah, innocent until proven guilty.  Let's go with it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But right now, I think they're just like, look, we think she did it, and we're going  to make sure we push public opinion together.  They are all just this horrible woman, and what she did with this child.  Oh, this awful, terrible...  But can I say, before you do that, though, you have to be fair. 
[02:28:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You've got to be fair.  It's about OJ.  Yeah.  If you're going to...  Look it.  He got found not guilty.  That's what this game is.  Yeah, yeah.  But this world would not let that slide.  They were willing to change the justices to get this nigga.  But this girl...  I'm trying to say, look, it does seem like that this girl...  It's supposedly from what I...  The movies and the Three Stooges things I saw, it's fucking innocent until proven guilty 
[02:29:00]  beyond the shadow of it, beyond reasonable doubt.  Yeah.  So, it's not looking good for her just by public opinion, but as far as the case go, that dumb  prosecutor, who looks like Nancy Grace, that dumb bouffant hairdo, trying to make her  name, she's babbling on.  I don't think they have enough, not for murder one.  And the black judge is great.  Oh my God, that guy is a TV judge.  He's a great judge.  He should be a movie judge. 
[02:29:30]  He's like that...  He should be in the movies.  He's like, skidly-doo.  Skidly-doo.  Did they say some shit?  Well...  Yeah.  Don't have to look at his paperwork.  It's clear.  It ain't no...  It's just...  No Judge Edo.  Let's be honest.  Like, it's very fair.  Yeah.  And, you know...  They're like, your honor, we'd like to call for mistrial based on the evidence that  the prosecution put up at Crossroads.  And the prosecution's like, no, you know, this is...  We have precedent in this case and stuff.  And the guy's like, my motion denied. 
[02:30:00]  Let's take a break.  We're going to recess till three.  Well, I can understand that.  I thought I needed to know legal mumbo jumbo.  I want to work in that world where we can just go, we're going to take a recess till  five.  Yeah, what do you say?  We're going to finish our show...  What do you say?  ...very in the afternoon.  But she is...  We're going to take four hours off that.  She is the typical white trash fucking just crazy bitch that would be at my house.  Something happened.  Yeah, something happened.  But I don't...  I don't...  I don't think it's more of a lot of the... 
[02:30:30]  I don't think it was premeditated murder.  But...  A lot of irresponsibility.  Yeah.  My...  Something happened.  And then she said, fuck, I got to cover this shit up.  It's more a cover up than it is...  She liked to party.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, so something...  And the kid got in the way of the party.  Something bad happened.  Because I know I always think sometimes, you know, if I'm looking down, texting or doing  something wrong I ain't supposed to, and I go, what am I...  Sometimes I stop and I go, I envision myself hitting someone.  Yeah.  And I go, what the fuck are you doing?  But then I envision myself leaving. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  And leaving the person fucking flapping like a fish in the street.  And I'm like, oh my God, that's my first instinct is to run.  Really?  Run!  Yeah.  Like, I go, damn, so something happens to a kid, you go, oh my God, man, what am I going  to do?  There's no witnesses?  There's no nothing?  You just go, I'm leaving myself on the mercy of what you're going to do to me.  Just like Plastic O'Burris.  I know the letter of the law, you get two years, but like, he shot himself. 
[02:31:30]  Like, prison is supposed to be a place for redemption and to penance.  Yeah.  The penitentiary.  But, but it's like they send you to jail.  I learned my lesson.  I don't think every murderer should have to go to jail.  Like, I, I shot that man.  I don't shoot anybody else.  Yeah, I'll never shoot anyone else again.  I swear to God, it fucked me up.  I'll never shoot anyone. 
[02:32:00]  Plastic O'Burris shot himself.  That should have been good enough.  Yeah, I think he's going to use a holster next time.  I don't think he's going to shoot himself again anytime soon.  Use a holster, you dumb motherfucker.  He hates guns now.  Yeah.  I know.  Did he hear us talk about that?  No.  It's sort of like the Tracy thing.  All of a sudden, he now hates guns.  Now he's a spokesman for the Brady fucking bill.  This guy loves guns.  The Brady organization for gun safety.  He wants to get back in the NFL.  Yeah.  But here's the thing.  And he's not sure if it's a guarantee that he's going to have a shot at that.  Yeah.  What's wrong with him saying this?  Mm-hmm. 
[02:32:30]  Okay.  What's wrong with him saying, uh, I, I don't love guns, but here's why I carry guns.  I, niggas ain't shit.  They're going to rob me, try to steal my money and do shit.  I don't like white people.  So I'd rather carry a gun and hang out with black people than to not carry one and hang  out with white people.  I don't think that'd watch.  For safety of white people, I don't need a gun, but niggas are way more fun.  But they, but they crazy.  But they crazy. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, shit.  These niggas think this, this watch is real.  I'm just chilling.  God damn.  I'm just chilling.  Oh, shit.  I can return.  Yeah.  He wasn't registered in Jersey or fucking New York, obviously.  Of course not.  Cause he was, he was doing some hood shit.  Where would he be?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's sticking his fucking, a 40 in his goddamn sweat pants.  You can't, if you're going to put a gun in your waistband and be all cool and shit,  you better have a tight fucking waistband.  You can't put it in sweats.  You can't even put your wall. 
[02:33:30]  I've tried like, like the fucking, someone knocks on the door and I know I need a little  money.  And I try to put my wallet in my sweat pants or something.  It just falls out the foot of your pants.  A gun.  That ain't going to fucking stay.  He shot himself in the fucking leg.  He was all cocked, not locked.  The fucking thing shoots himself in the leg.  And then he gets a couple of years in the jerk.  Is there any way people could fucking fix their, I was thinking about how to fix LeBron's  situation of hatred.  Yeah.  And I swear, but he fucked up because they lost. 
[02:34:00]  But I was thinking how he would have got out of it if they won, all right, during the championship  celebration.  He, he cried and he's feeling very sad.  And people go, what's going on, man?  And he just goes, I, I, I just can't help but think about Cleveland.  And I made a big mistake.  I feel like this celebration should be.  Where is this going?  With, oh, damn, it's never what it is.  Sorry.  The bad fucking, it's never what it is. 
[02:34:30]  No, that'd be hilarious.  But then he gets out of it.  Like, he can get out of this PR thing by actually, like, going, I know I made a mistake leaving.  And then I can't leave Miami.  I'm under contract.  What would Cleveland do?  But then Miami would hate on him.  No, he goes, I'm going to play hard for Miami, but I, Miami people have to understand  it.  It's just like all the mini Cubans here.  You live in Miami with your hearts in Cuban.  Oh, man.  I made a big mistake.  I, I dedicate this ring to Cleveland and that owner's funny looking son. 
[02:35:00]  Wow.  I remember that.  Yeah.  He went deep.  Nice.  Oh, shit, man.  It's like, you just go, you just, he just has to play that PR thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Instead of apologize.  He just goes, he just fakes it.  Now, I think Cleveland people would stick their middle finger up right at him.  Yeah.  They go, fuck you.  But the rest of the world will go.  What do you think?  He's all right. 
[02:35:30]  It's obvious.  He's all right by me.  It's obvious the rest of the NBA cities.  What, what, the fans in Miami, what do you think they're thinking today?  Uh.  Are they a little fucking like, what the fuck, dude?  Nah, because they're fair weather fans are like Atlanta fans.  They don't give a fuck anyway.  They're not real gangster fans.  They just, they was front running.  They were, but they were motherfuckers who enjoyed the enjoyment.  But when they were down, like, look, Dallas came back from 15 down with six minutes.  The girls watching shit this morning.  And that was it.  They were one three in a row, man.  Fucking Miami was down 10 with three minutes. 
[02:36:00]  The fans were walked out on the way to their yachts.  Yeah.  Is this, did his stock drop in Miami a little bit?  For now, yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't.  But here's the thing.  The thing with them, though, if I may give the advice, I think how they win.  I like Wade, by the way.  By the, I love Wade.  This is what I'm going to say, man.  Out of all this.  They, they got this thing with it, where they're trying to share.  It's like, no, you shoot LeBron. 
[02:36:30]  No, you shoot Christopher.  For, it's like, Dwayne Wade has to take over and go, you two pussies are my running.  You, I, this is my team.  You can tell now.  Mine.  Mine.  So, shut your fucking mouth.  Grab rebounds.  It's, it's no more the three.  It's, LeBron put himself in a situation to be a fucking, the two guy.  Superman is the second guy.  Batman runs the Justice League. 
[02:37:00]  Can you imagine that shit?  I love the Justice League fucking thing.  Wayne's going to grab, take control now.  Yeah, he's not bullshitting around.  No, I could, I could feel that.  He was screaming at him.  Screaming at LeBron.  He was giving a look like, what the fuck?  So, next year, it's going to be, I don't even, I think there's going to be some cracks  in their friendship, even, a little bit.  I don't think, I, yeah, that's what happens when you mix business with pleasure.  They thought it was going to be, and then they found out Chris Bosh is a, a wailing  sissy.  He's a sissy.  He cries like a fat black bitch at church. 
[02:37:30]  He dropped to his hands and knees like his motherfucking first cousin died.  He was like, this, this is what wasn't supposed, it wasn't supposed to be.  You didn't see that motherfucker.  I saw.  Knees buckle.  I saw.  Over a basketball game.  I saw, because he, he believed it, man.  Like, we were supposed to win.  Jordan's father was murdered.  He, he came back and won three championships.  He identified the body and got back on the court. 
[02:38:00]  That motherfucker didn't quit to the next year.  Right.  He took a break then.  Yeah.  Then he finally took his break.  He took that break.  He, he won a championship, cried because his dad got murdered at a parking lot.  Yeah.  And still beat Utah Jazz.  He was crying as he was hugging the trophy.  Yes.  A pretty amazing NBA moment.  Fucking, Kobe got a rape beef.  He's dropped 80.  Yeah, he had that shit on his mind.  White bitch in Colorado got a sodomy rape beef charge over his head. 
[02:38:30]  A nigga dropped 81 points.  What do you know about that rumor?  We didn't really talk about it much because I, I didn't know much about it.  This is the fuck rumor again?  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to tell you.  I'm suspicious that LeBron's starting to fucking put these rumors out there because he's scared  of winning or something.  Rashad Griffin, Rashad Griffin, um, he got on the radio.  I heard him say he got on the radio.  He, the way he denied it, I believe him.  He, cause he was, he sounds scared.  He said, he said, man, I don't know her. 
[02:39:00]  I know I didn't fuck her.  No.  He said, we are in a, he said sorority, but he meant fraternity.  He said that our fraternity is too fucking small.  I would never, I called his stepdad or whatever.  I, he said he called some people.  I don't know who he called, but he, the way he sound, he sound like a motherfucker and  said, Oh my God, please don't put me in the middle of no shit like this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I believe him.  I got to believe him.  He said he called their people and their people said, we believe you.  Who's starting that shit though?  Well, it was rumors that Jason Terry was saying some fucked up shit to LeBron. 
[02:39:30]  Like Jason Terry said, he ain't going to be able to guard me.  But I heard Jason, I heard a rumor on, on black websites that Jason Terry was saying  shit about LeBron's mom's getting fucked.  He was saying this shit that that's why your boy's fucking your girl now.  That's why your boy was shot.  That's what I, that's what, it's all hearsay.  But that Terry, Jason Terry was fucking with him bad.  Damn.  Yeah.  Mentally fucking with him. 
[02:40:00]  Like, like, and Jason Terry's questionably a, uh, you know, a bad little asshole.  Like, you know, he's a motherfucker.  He's a motherfucker.  Jason Terry.  Apparently so.  Yeah.  That's what, but that, that rumor, I, it was squelched, but I believe, I believe, I believe  that he didn't, you know, do that.  What's that story I heard this morning about, uh, God damn, supposedly some guy got his ass  beat cause he might've had a sex tape of Shaq. 
[02:40:30]  Oh yeah.  Shaq.  Shaq sends some people out to fuck somebody up to get that tape back.  Shaq wasn't, um, implicated in any of this, but, uh, there's something went on.  They grabbed this guy and beat the living piss out of him and just kept asking him, you  know, where's the fucking tape?  Where's the sex tape?  A Shaq sex tape.  Gang accused of kidnapping man who claims to own Shaq sex tape.  That's gotta be an ugly fucking sex tape.  Yeah.  Big, big Shaq. 
[02:41:00]  Just pounding away.  You know, you ever fucking be, you ever fucking girl that fucked a celebrity and just went on  big, they're packing?  Just to know.  And the word, you think, you think Shaq, I mess with a girl that fucked Shaq and you think  Shaq would have a baby arm, but, but they said he was fucking, that's probably, if he  had a baby arm, you like, fuck it.  Watch the tape.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like I would try very hard to get my sex tape back.  If you didn't, but maybe he does have a baby arm, but because he's seven foot tall, it 
[02:41:30]  doesn't look like a baby arm.  Nah.  An eight inch dick is an eight inch dick on anybody.  I think you don't need a 14 inch dick cause you're 10 inch, 10 feet tall.  Okay.  The vagina is the same size.  So, you know, it's not going to make a difference.  Yeah.  Supposedly.  Well, we can't prove it, but obviously he might've sent some boys to rough up some people.  He, he, he, like I said, he hasn't been implicated at anything.  Or at least he knows people that would do that for him without him asking probably. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Like that'd be odd, wouldn't it?  Somebody just beats the shit out of this guy.  If the word didn't come down from someone that at least knows him very closely, you don't  just all of a sudden go, what?  Some guys claiming he's got a Shaq tape.  I like Shaq.  Let's go beat the fuck out of this guy and torture him until he gives us the fucking tape.  Wait a minute though, but don't, please don't, don't, don't, don't rule out a dumb bitch  that said, that's why Shaq got a, or that's why I got a sex tape fucking Shaq.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or my girl fucking Shaq. 
[02:42:30]  And I gave it to this nigga.  And they said, what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Him.  He got it.  Oh shit.  And this guy's just like, huh?  He gets the shit beat out of him.  Motherfuck's doing crazy shit over some pussy.  That's why I got a Shaq sex tape.  I'm going to sell it.  And I gave it to my friend Cleophus right there.  He got it.  And you're going to have to fuck him up to get it because he love me.  He ain't going to let you get my fucking sex tape.  Oh damn.  You dumb bitch. 
[02:43:00]  Don't fucking put me in the middle of this shit.  That is fucking absolutely what could happen.  Women can get you fucked up.  They get a motherfucking loving you enough.  Holy shit.  What do you think of Shaq retiring, man?  He should.  Yeah, it was time.  He's a giant fat man.  His knees is coming up to his hips.  He's a fucking 40-year-old fat man.  He should have never made the Cleveland run.  Trying to be fucking charming.  Remember the shovel they gave him when he went to Cleveland?  Because there's a lot of snow up there. 
[02:43:30]  You didn't remember the press conference where they handed him a shovel?  You're going to need it up here, Shaq.  What, do you have to stand there with a snow shovel?  A brand new shovel.  He got out of there fast.  Like he's fucking there shoveling snow.  He should be done.  And I hope he doesn't come back.  Because they say he might.  But, you know, they'll make Shaq a great, like, a Charles Barkley dude.  I don't think he has the personality.  I never thought he had that personality.  He's very monotone, man.  He thinks he's hilarious, though.  He does, right?  But his delivery is very, very... 
[02:44:00]  I see hot.  He was icy hot.  I love Barkley.  He's just fucking...  There's really nothing going on there.  Barkley was trash in Miami so bad.  Barkley said, he goes, I hate...  It's something about that team that makes me sick.  Oh, shit.  A lot of fucking smack talkers in basketball.  I think more so than any other sport.  Oh, yeah.  Did you tweet this?  Patrice's tweet after the Heat loss about LeBron has Superman abilities but wants to be 
[02:44:30]  a wonder twit.  Power of a bum.  Power of a bum.  No, form.  Oh, form of a bum.  Form of...  This guy wrote down.  Form of a bum.  Almost famous.  And you don't care about hockey, obviously.  You're from Boston.  You got the Bruins game seven tonight, man.  Actually, somehow I care about it.  You do care.  No, you care because...  Well, because it's Boston, yeah.  It's been a great, ugly series.  I'll be watching tonight.  It's not been an ugly series.  It's been hard for Boston to score in Vancouver. 
[02:45:00]  Right.  And then they scored 90 goals in Boston.  I'm just saying ugly with the hits and everything that's been going on.  Oh, man.  It's been great hockey.  That guy Patrice was named Bergeron, maybe?  He got fucked up.  Sometimes...  You know I'm getting old.  You know you're getting old when you can't watch violence no more?  Like...  It just makes you go like, ugh.  I used to go on sites to see beheadings on a regular basis.  Damn.  I can't...  Now violent hockey hits.  Yeah.  And the guy's sitting there doing the shake. 
[02:45:30]  The apology.  Oh, I watch these websites.  They'll have...  Somehow young women are getting very...  Oh, man.  Violent.  Dude, I've watched those videos.  It's crazy.  They're beating the living shit out of each other.  You know what I can't take on those fight videos?  I can take like the punching and shit like that.  When someone's down and they get kicked in the face.  They get kicked and stomped.  Or their head stomped.  Like when their head is just bouncing and they're knocked the fuck out.  I don't like that.  I don't like the violence in them all.  I don't like that.  I think I'm with you on that too. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  I don't like that.  And girls are getting brutal.  Crazy.  Young teenage girls are becoming fucking animals.  Just crazy, man.  I like the fights though where the guys are like, oh, damn.  And he's picking up weave pieces.  He's picking up fucking weave pieces and is showing them to the camera because these two  bitches were going animal on each other.  I was scared of adults.  Now it's like, my mother came to visit last year and some kids were doing something.  And she goes, now you know y'all ain't supposed... 
[02:46:30]  I said, moms.  Moms.  No, this ain't back in the day where everybody goes, sorry, miss.  Kick my mother's fat ass and she'll die from one punch.  Like, moms, please don't get killed trying to be old lady respect Jones and shit.  Oh, God damn.  Misrespected Jones.  From the block.  Now you know you boys ain't supposed to be...  Shut up, fat bitch.  Now come up, moms.  Just come on up.  You just described a hundred movies where the gang members respect her. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, just like she come on the porch with a broom.  Y'all get out of here with your guns and drugs.  Right.  Shoot that fat bitch in the leg.  Please don't shoot my mother's leg.  Sir, sorry.  Sir, sorry.  Mom's getting in the house.  Moms, this isn't the movie.  Yeah, this ain't the movie.  Please.  No more respect from the kids and shit.  I used to be scared of adults.  Adults, adults will say something.  Any adult.  You go, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  Sorry.  Now?  Young kids walk by? 
[02:47:30]  What'd you say, old man?  I told these two fat girls, hey, can you...  Sweetie, you see these cars?  You see people?  You just threw a bottle?  She looked at me like...  Oh, no.  Oh, what were you talking about?  Like, what the fuck?  Nigga, please.  What is this?  You can't.  Oh, shit.  I saw this one.  This is a laundromat fight.  We were just fucking...  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  You popped it up.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I thought it was on TV.  Pandemonium in a laundromat.  But it's two bitches beating the living shit out of each other. 
[02:48:00]  And then there's this pandemonium.  And there's not one that's listed 712 pounds.  No.  Them some big bitches.  There's some fucking fighting going on here.  And what are they fighting over?  The fucking detergent?  The dryer.  The dryer, probably.  The softener?  I think one bitch took the other bitch's clothes out of the dryer before they would dry.  That's all it takes, right?  And then, yeah.  And put them in a dryer.  Come on.  And look at this fucking...  Holy shit.  This beefy broad.  And the guys are all with the cell phones. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, shit.  And at some point, they always got to turn the cell phone around and go,  God damn, kids beating the shit out of each other.  Like, get their face on it.  This motherfucker's on YouTube, motherfucker.  They got to...  Oh, here's another one.  Here's another one.  Oh, man.  This bitch is real...  Get out of here.  She's squaring off, baby.  She's squaring off.  She's all fucking...  Oh, shit.  She's ready to roll.  Yeah?  That's my man.  My man's.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, shit.  Here it goes.  Damn.  Man, they got one where a girl gets hit by a tire iron.  Let's try to find that one.  She got hit by a tire iron and goes down in a heap.  And they're looking for whoever did it.  Because I think that girl either died or was close to dying.  Fucked her up. 
[02:49:30]  Fucked her.  And the girl hit her like it was WWE came up behind it.  It looked fake almost.  Oh, man.  They're getting brutal.  But they got some white bitches on there, too.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I mean.  I was going to say that.  Doing MMA and shit.  They got white bitches doing a set-up official MMA.  They got one where these two white girls are fighting.  And the mother's daughter...  The daughter's losing.  And the mom's clocks the daughter...  One of the girls to just...  And then puts the daughter on top of her and finish...  You know...  Jesus Christ.  I don't know what's going on. 
[02:50:00]  What the fuck is going on?  Is it just that there's so many cameras around?  Oh, of course.  But this shit really wasn't happening.  I don't remember this shit happening.  Ah, fuck it.  In the schoolyard, as they say.  I think.  In the schoolyard.  I think a lot of this has always been happening.  I don't think so.  We're just filming everything.  I don't remember seeing this shit.  We all walk around with fucking video cameras now.  Every single one of us.  What the hell is this? 
[02:50:30]  It's some bitches bent over.  Oh, these are like some fucking park performers.  I've seen these guys in the park.  And then the one guy jumps over the civilians.  What the hell?  These dumb tourists.  Don't know.  They're probably getting their pockets picked.  What the hell are they?  What's the gimmick?  These guys put too much work into panhandling.  Just got to stand there with a fucking bucket. 
[02:51:00]  What happened to the bucket guy?  Yeah, where's the bucket guy?  What's the big deal with this video?  Because I just saw this exact act in the park a couple days ago.  And what happens?  Somebody's getting kicked in.  The guy.  Oh, he did a flip over the top of him.  There's nothing going on there?  There's nothing more?  Okay, yeah.  I've seen that.  Those guys perform in the park all the time.  Yeah, they had some white bitches.  Sam, why'd you do that?  It's all hype, man.  They set it up for about 10 or 15 minutes, get everyone's money, and they do one trick. 
[02:51:30]  And they get money, and then the one guy jumps.  Jumps over, you know, six or seven people that are kind of hunched over.  Just get your fucking bucket out.  Put fucking, I need food.  Get yourself a little kitten.  Put it on a blanket.  Hey, we mentioned the OJ trial.  The only reason I go back to that is because 16 years ago, one of the greatest moments happened.  OJ trying on that fucking glove.  The glove that did not fit.  With that stupid Marsha Clark, like, just accepting what she was seeing instead of saying,  what the fuck, will you put the glove on? 
[02:52:00]  All I remember is her sickly hair.  Oh, yeah.  And then she had, like, a makeover by the end of the trial.  She was trying to get herself, like, better hair.  She realized she was becoming famous.  Yeah.  Might as well look the part.  All of them did.  You know what?  I remember the name Judge Ito.  16 years ago.  Judge Ito.  Oh, I remember Ito.  Judge Ito.  What is he doing now?  Christopher Darden.  Christopher Darden.  Is he dealing with, like, traffic shit somewhere?  Judge Ito's in fucking traffic court.  Yeah.  Somewhere.  You know he's probably still behind a bench somewhere.  Damn.  That was it for him.  Darden's probably a researcher for a low-level judge. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because he's the guy that lost the fucking case.  Precedence.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  A couple of those guys actually are still working.  God, I forgot about him, too.  Did he finally forgive OJ because he's in jail?  Eh, you know, he's locked up.  Poor OJ with his bad knees.  Can he get out for this and then he go back to normal?  Why didn't Marcia...  Did she ever comment that OJ had to put the glove over the other glove, first of all?  Did that ever come up?  I don't remember.  It's been so long now.  No.  Look how hard he's fucking...  Look how hard he's... 
[02:53:00]  He's like, I don't fit.  Look.  Look how hard he's fake trying.  I know.  That's a naked gun fucking acting move.  But you know what I was...  Why did it need to fit?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  What?  What?  You have to have great fitting gloves to commit a murder.  Wouldn't you, like, maybe get a glove that doesn't fit quite right?  Or maybe it's a little too big?  If it doesn't go over the fingertips, you mustn't quit.  Yeah.  You just need the fingertips covered.  Yeah.  Like, it doesn't need to fit.  God, you're right.  That is great.  It's like, so what?  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  You're so right.  Just hold...  The way it fit him...  Yeah.  ...was good enough.  You could hold that knife.  Right.  It was good enough.  You could hold the knife.  But Marcy Clark was too stupid to understand any of that stuff.  Like, so what?  OJ's like, look, it don't even go on.  It could fit just like that.  The best part is OJ knows damn well that that was his glove and it fit perfectly.  And when he first started trying it on, he went, holy shit, this doesn't fit.  He's putting it on, too.  It's like, why would they allow him...  Right.  They were trying to go for this moment where, let's get the murderer putting the glove on. 
[02:54:00]  The jury's going to actually see the murderer putting on the murder glove.  And they thought it was going to be so good.  And he's like, this motherfucker don't fit.  We're watching the video right now.  And when OJ first tries to put the glove on, you see the surprise on his face.  Like, holy shit, it's not going to fit.  Yeah.  But I use these to kill those people.  And then Darden is just like, looking at the glove like, how does it not fit?  We did this a million times and they fit when I killed those people.  I swear they did.  Some people say it was OJ's son. 
[02:54:30]  Really?  I don't think so.  Do you think OJ killed those people, Patrice?  Yes.  And I'll tell you when I realized it.  When he...  Did you...  Hold on, hold on.  Let me back you up because I know what you're doing there.  When you first heard about this...  It didn't matter.  It didn't matter.  Yeah, it didn't...  It was just watching it.  Yeah.  Okay, when did you realize?  Sorry. 
[02:55:00]  When he wrote the book, If I Killed the Bitch.  Is how I would have done it.  If I Killed the Bitch.  Why would you do that?  Ah, that's classic.  I didn't do it because if I did it, I'd have drowned a bitch in the toilet.  He just gives all the details, but he's safe because the book was If I.  If I.  If I did.  If I killed this bitch, here's how I would have done it.  Wasn't he If in tiny font, too?  Yeah, yeah.  If I...  If I Killed the Bitch with If in a horrible little tiny font. 
[02:55:30]  That was very...  That trial was very racial.  Oh, man.  It was just very racial.  And it didn't matter if he did.  It's just the fact that he got off is when I got into it.  Yeah, yeah.  But whether he did or not, I wasn't too much into it.  I didn't watch it every day.  Yeah, look how the cover is, too.  Yeah, the If part is in the middle of the eye.  Oh, my God.  Where's the If?  That is not...  No, that's by the Goldman family.  If I did it.  Oh, okay.  That's the other book that was put out. 
[02:56:00]  You motherfucker.  The If is the littlest If.  The If is inside the eye.  Yeah.  Ah, shit.  That's classic.  Mm-hmm.  But when...  Oh, we should break again?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  We got some shit?  All right.  Well, you're...  No, it's just commercial stuff we got to deal with today.  Oh.  We're a little behind on reads, are we?  Way behind.  Well, then why don't you fucking do something?  Okay, remind people I've got Caroline's.  Oh, sure, sure. 
[02:56:30]  Yes.  We're going to finish up with Patrice, but he's playing Caroline's one night only.  Tomorrow night, 8 o'clock, 2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  These tickets will sell really well, so get on the phone and get yourself some tickets if  you're going to be around Thursday, tomorrow, 8 p.m., Caroline's, 2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  Sirius XM, the virus.  Follow the O.P. and Anthony Show online, facebook.com slash O.P. and Anthony.  Twitter.com slash O.P. Radio.  Twitter.com slash Anthony Cumia.  And Twitter.com slash Jim Norton. 
[02:57:00]  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's going to hurt us, but we've got to do this.  Steve Blatter just popped his head into the studio.  Uh-huh.  And we gave him a nice beating earlier.  Oh, sure.  But fair is fair.  He emailed the Gene Simmons, Shannon Tweed walking off the Joy Behar show. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  And it was presented in his email, in my opinion, like he thought it was real.  So we had to beat him up for it.  And he popped his head in.  And he swore at us, basically, saying, look, dude, I thought it was so obvious it was fake  that I didn't have to write that.  Ah.  And I believe him.  So, you know.  Yeah, because it is.  He said he watched the video.  It was all just horrible.  I mean, we beat the shit out of those guys, but, you know, fair is fair.  I believe him.  Yeah.  But, unfortunately, Joy Behar bought into it.  Yeah, that. 
[02:58:00]  I don't get that.  She became part of the work.  On purpose?  I probably think so.  She's not that.  Nah.  I don't think she's like that.  I don't.  I can't see her being that stupid.  I just can't.  But why?  Why would she play into it?  It would be better headlines for her if she said this is bullshit.  Guests on her show.  She's just fucking.  Maybe other publicists that represent other people.  You know how that works.  All right.  One of those deals.  It'll be curious to see how it plays out with her. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  Because she's got to talk about it, right?  That happened last night, so we'll see what she says today.  We did the fucking hockey.  We did O.J.  Dan Quayle.  Potato.  19 years ago today.  Wow.  So if you was born then, you're 19 right now.  Yeah, yeah.  You're 19 years old.  Potato.  And I remember that shit like.  Yeah, vividly.  I saw that on TV, and then I drove somewhere, probably to drink legally.  Oh.  That's fucking. 
[02:59:00]  You were probably talking about doing a gig together.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Ah, boy.  The time do fly by.  Yeah.  And Mark Cuban is paying for the Mavericks parade.  Why wouldn't the city pay for that shit?  Well, he said.  I think he's just giving them a break.  Yeah.  In these hard economic times.  Ah.  Doesn't want taxpayer dollars going to a.  Yeah, but I mean.  How much could that cost?  I think it's all like police clean up, all that shit.  Oh, okay.  But all those people that are going to be part of the parade are going to be paying for parking,  paying for some food, paying for some water, paying, paying, paying. 
[02:59:30]  He's not going to pay for the whole fucking thing.  You don't think?  Why not?  He's paying for the whole.  No, I'm just saying.  Why wouldn't the city pay for it, knowing the people are going to be, you know, spending  money that day?  Because the city.  They're going to be going to bars afterwards.  They're going to be eating.  They're going to be doing this.  Well, that way they get to make some money instead of having to shell out some later  for fucking sanitation and extra security and all that shit.  Fair enough.  Fair enough, sir.  I gather.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  No.  And everyone is, you know, talking about how he spent a hundred and what was it? 
[03:00:00]  Ten thousand dollars.  A hundred and ten grand.  Ninety thousand for a bottle of champagne and then a twenty thousand dollar tip, I guess.  Twenty thousand dollar tip.  That's nice.  When you got a billion dollars, it's just nice and relative.  Yeah.  Could you a hundred and ten to just play with, like, just play with garbage money?  I would be so much fun.  It would really be a lot of fun.  You could make people really happy, you know?  I mean, who do you give that twenty thousand dollar tip to?  That's got to be like, holy fuck. 
[03:00:30]  And I wonder if they let that person have it.  Yeah.  And that's the kind of job, like a service industry job that, you know, where you can  get that kind of money and that kind of tip, you know?  Because it's Miami and it's rich people.  And so, I mean, that's amazing.  But they probably have to split it.  Yeah, they probably do.  Yeah.  Split it.  It's like working at a great strip club.  Boss takes his skim.  I feel good when I give somebody twenty-two percent.  Twenty-two percent.  It's crazy.  Are we up to twenty-two now? 
[03:01:00]  I don't know.  It's my tip calculator.  I'm a twenty guy.  Never less than twenty because the math on that's easy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very easy.  Never less than twenty.  Yeah.  And a little more if, ah, whatever.  Is it better to give somebody that's a bad service person no tip or a shitty tip to get  your point across?  No tip is definitely worse than even a shitty tip.  And then they have to run.  I think.  Run out after you and go, you didn't tip.  And you look at them and go, yeah, I know.  And then it really hurts.  The only shitty tip is the penny. 
[03:01:30]  When you leave the penny under the glass, overturned glass, that is a fuck you.  That's saying that you did a bad job.  That literally said.  That isn't like, if you leave no tip, that could be anything.  They forgot their cheapest fuck.  But when you leave that, it lets them know that they fucked, they screwed the pooch so  bad.  We did that at Friendly's just to be assholes.  Yeah.  It wasn't even about the service.  Oh, a bunch of pricks.  A bunch of Sundays.  Crazy Greenlawn people. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, we were crazy.  Wow.  Then we were insane.  On to Broadway and kick over some garbage pails.  Yeah, we were crazy.  Kids.  That's a ridiculous job to have as a job to work.  Like, I think you depend on people's generosity.  Yeah.  It's a weird thing.  As it's, as a, you depend on people's generosity as it's, it's your salary.  Yeah.  Like, but you've, I do have a choice.  Like, I do, I do have a choice just not to tip.  Not to tip.  No, you don't.  No, no. 
[03:02:30]  Why is it, there are places, why is it legal where they go, oh, we added the 18%?  Oh, tip included.  Yeah, that's kind of weird.  How is that legal?  I think that's more than six, though.  I've seen somewhere, it doesn't matter how many people.  Yeah, some places, now it's across the board.  And my thing is, I, I, believe it or not, I mean, for the show, sure, I'm cheap, short  arms, whatever.  But I'm, I'm, I, I'm a good tipper.  I really am.  But I want to be, feel like I have a choice in this.  Yeah.  You get that bill, it's like, oh, we added the 18% tip.  Because I feel like if, if the tip's included, then they're not going to have to work as 
[03:03:00]  hard, right?  Yeah.  Or do that little extra that makes you go, you know, that was nice.  I'm going to fucking, you know, give a nice tip today.  Well, it's like, I mean, the, the hotel, the, you know, uh, room service, they put it  in, but I still feel like I got to give them a little something because you're like, damn.  You want to do that old school in, this is for you, sir.  You know, take a, why, thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Cumia.  I give them like a five.  Right.  But they put it on the tip and I go, you know, if I order you, you want this person to, to 
[03:03:30]  feel good about the situation.  You know what I mean?  And how weird is it that, and I want them to make it snappy, but how weird is it that  the tip included on room service, you, you feel guilty.  Like you have to give them more because they're there, the hotel steals from them, but they're  obviously getting a really good tip.  They're nice.  And then there's a room service charge that has nothing to do with them.  Right.  So that's for the hotel.  You think they paid those fucking Mexicans?  No.  Anything?  And you fucking give them.  I always go, tip and clue.  They go, yeah, right there, sir.  And then you, then you're like, fuck. 
[03:04:00]  Damn.  I feel guilty.  I got to fucking go get more money now.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Seriously.  Like, cause you go, he's there.  Right.  You're looking at some Filipino kid and you're like, he just pushed, you're in your shorts  with no shirt.  He's pretending not to be horrified.  And he just pushes in.  He's praying you're not going to make a move on him.  Yeah.  He's, he's, he's unfolding that, that silly table.  And, uh, you know, I don't like when they do anything. 
[03:04:30]  I wheel the fucking thing in and get the fuck out.  I'm going to give you money no matter what.  Yeah.  Half the time.  It's more of a hassle.  It's like, just fucking put it right there.  We'll figure it all out.  You don't have to identify the food for me.  Cause this is your burger.  Here's your soup.  Get your fucking finger.  Get your finger out of my iron top hole.  Exactly.  You fucking put it in my mashed potatoes.  You cocksucker.  Don't put your finger in my hole on my iron top.  Yes.  You just picked your fucking dirty nose.  I hate that. 
[03:05:00]  And you're standing awkwardly as they're doing this whole presentation.  Yeah.  This is not good for me.  I just want you to leave.  Would you like me to?  No.  No.  I would like nothing.  And I say, just throw it on the bed.  Leave it.  You can say, just put it here.  I have.  Oh yeah, I have.  Oh yeah, we do that.  Put it here.  We do that.  Would you like me to pull the?  No.  Now, are you guys throw everything in the hallway, guys?  Or are you leaving it in your room?  I'll leave it in the fucking room.  Unless I'm going to be there a few days, I will leave that fucking thing in there to rot. 
[03:05:30]  I don't care.  I'm a get out of here.  I push that thing out like it's the TV from Poltergeist with unfinished french fries on  the floor.  Just get that shit out of here.  It's just creepy.  Yeah.  Well, I don't like it in there.  You don't like it in there?  No.  When I'm somewhere for two or three days, I'm amazed how they know how to clean my room.  Because we're like a tornado.  Just a fucking disaster?  And I'm like, how are they figuring out what's not junk and what's not? 
[03:06:00]  It amazes me they know how to do that shit.  No matter how long I stay at a hotel, I do not get room service.  I just do not.  Oh, you mean like maid service?  Maid service.  Why not?  Yeah.  I rarely do.  And they hunt you down.  I get a message.  There's a sting.  They hunt.  And I...  Would you like us to clean that?  Nah.  My biggest pet peeve, if we're really doing this bit, are we really doing this bit?  Nah, we've been there.  You travel to...  You know, with all the traveling you do, Patrice, you travel to a city, you're tired from traveling, 
[03:06:30]  all you want to do is get to your room, maybe fucking put your head down, and what do they  do?  Half hour after you're in the room, which is prime, where you should be out cold, they have  to fucking call?  What is that about?  What, and say welcome?  No, is everything okay, sir?  Is everything okay?  Yes!  Yeah.  I would have called you if there was a problem.  If it wasn't, exactly.  And it's always when you're falling the fuck asleep, because you're exhausted, you just  want to get a nap in, or whatever.  I've had them come to the door, like, I forgot to put the do not disturb, because I ran to  the bathroom to take a dump or something, and then they knock on the door, and then 
[03:07:00]  come walking in.  It's just like, ah, but I'm on the shitter.  Is that what you tell them?  Yeah.  You're a hard-armed guy, aren't you?  Yeah.  Oops, I didn't mean...  Because I'm jacking on the bed.  You ever rape a black maid?  Nah, never, never, uh, never tried.  They run out.  You've never been an 84-year-old man who runs around raping 22-year-old fucking physical  specimens?  Although I do have this...  And sticks his old cock up in her ass as she's fighting an 87-year-old man. 
[03:07:30]  And then he tries to pay off the village, and they say no?  I would sacrifice my fucking aunt for that.  You saw that, right?  When he went to the little village, and...  I followed that all the way up until he finally said, it's a setup.  Ah, yeah.  Always a setup.  But what...  I'd like to...  I would rescue her right at the...  Because I would like to say, okay, we're going to play a game called Try to Rape, like,  an 80-year-old man try to rape a young... 
[03:08:00]  Did you see that, girl?  A young, virile, 20-something-year-old woman?  I just want to see if it can happen.  I promise you, I'll come in and save you right at DEFCON 11.  Right when it's ready to go down.  But I just want to see if it can happen.  You're thinking setup?  Dude, the fucking IMF guy, out of nowhere, he just...  They wanted him out, and he just fucking...  He just...  And it wasn't even...  It was immediate rape.  Yeah, he fled. 
[03:08:30]  Like, a rape that's a shock...  Like, he just...  An old man in a towel, and then the rape is on.  Yeah.  Like, that's just...  That sounds strange.  Yeah.  Strange.  Motherfucker, until this very moment, I didn't even think this way.  God damn, you're right.  I mean, this is...  Well, you know my situation.  I'm not a big conspiracy guy in general, but God, you know what?  Why didn't I, like, think out of the box on this one a little bit?  Like, it just is weird.  We don't know, obviously.  He's in a $3,000 of night thing. 
[03:09:00]  She comes in, and he just goes, rapey.  I'm gonna bump...  I'm bum-rushing this bitch.  I'm kidnapping her.  He's a little cheeseball.  Yeah.  He's a little old dude, like Mr. Woodman from Welcome Back, Carter.  And some fucking African girl from a village who's working in a $3,000 of night and just...  What do you think went on?  You think there might have been an understanding, and then she said, well, this understanding 
[03:09:30]  could turn into my favor here.  I think you're dealing with the movie Devil's Advocate type shit, that building.  It's like, I think these guys, that's the...  It's like, yeah, so what's your qualifications?  Well, I've worked in many hotels.  It's like, okay, this one, we need you, and you'll be paid handsomely.  You'll get $1,000 each time you're raped, but it gets rapey up in this bitch.  So do you want the job?  You just gotta get raped.  It gets a little rapey up here. 
[03:10:00]  Rapey.  Yeah, a little rapey.  You walk in, and little old men expect to get their dick sucked by third world women  that probably were kidnapped or something, and this time he goes in, he goes, he does,  oh, here's my rape victim today, and goes to try to do his thing.  She goes, whoo!  He goes, holy shit.  It's a setup.  He just tries to get the fuck out of here.  He did.  Because he's involved in all that creepy shit. 
[03:10:30]  He's a head of IMF.  Yeah, well, you know.  These old men do anything.  He's the guy.  You might have just turned me on the whole fucking shit.  He's the guy who decides how much money.  He runs money.  Yeah, I get it.  I know all that.  Throughout the planet Earth, and they wanted him out.  This raggedy, look at that girl.  Yeah.  But who hired her?  Nobody hired her.  People just said, you know, if somebody ever does something.  They just, they don't tell you exactly. 
[03:11:00]  Because they can't afford her to go, someone tell me to just, to scream.  No.  Probably, she might not have been in on it.  She works, see, there's the top.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  All right, let's slow down.  There's the top floor.  They hired her to be the rapety-rape, but she doesn't know that.  She might not know.  Now, she's like, she's not willing to be that person, but this guy now goes to these hotels  knowing they hire the rapety-rape person.  Stays on the top floor.  Right.  She probably works, actually, where regular people stay, where you don't rape. 
[03:11:30]  So they kind of set her up, too.  Like, we're putting you in this nice position as far as what she's thinking.  Yeah, set her up to go there and, yeah.  But the other side of this is, you know, this guy assuming she's just the next rapety-rape girl.  Yeah, she's the rape girl.  She's the offering.  $3,000 a night of penthouse apartments and shit, and she just walks in.  Damn it, dude.  And this motherfucker just starts trying to rape like that's what he's supposed to do.  Yeah.  Man, you got some.  And he just panics.  He don't go, he don't go, what are you fucking, bitch? 
[03:12:00]  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.  So, and a guy who's entitled like that that knows the deal, he waits for the guys to get there.  They go, what's going on with this bitch?  Fred, you know the deal.  Yeah, why ain't she rapey?  Fred never came around this time.  He obviously thought it was completely acceptable what he was doing.  Yes.  That's obvious to me.  Yes.  It's part of the deal, just like room service, right?  In that hotel.  Yep.  He thought it couldn't happen to him. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  You just turned me on the net.  Look at that girl.  What?  That old rotten man, that old rotten man is taking that pussy right there?  She would fucking fuck up his world.  She'd punch that motherfucker in the balls and laugh at him.  Yeah, look at her.  What is Bob Kelly doing here?  Hey, Bobby.  What is Bobby doing here?  He's probably got a show to do.  Yeah, he just gave us a look like, fuck you, I'm doing another show.  Yeah, he's making his own way in the world.  What was that shit?  Fuck you guys.  Making his own way.  What the fuck was that about?  Bob's making his own way.  He was very proud to walk by and let you guys know he's not coming in here. 
[03:13:00]  He gave us like a little peace sign.  He's like, I'm not waiting for your fucking call.  Peace out.  Fuck you.  Fuck Bob Kelly.  Hey, one more thing before we get out of here for today.  The Dalai Lama thing.  It might be more of a visual, but have you heard the Dalai Lama thing with this fucking  asshole trying to do a joke to the Dalai Lama?  Was he English or Australian?  No, no.  It's classic.  I think it was Australian, yeah.  I wanted to hate this asshole, but I fucking love this guy because he acknowledged that  it could be one of the biggest bombs ever. 
[03:13:30]  Where's Sam?  Because you need the visual.  I mean, we'll play the audio for everybody else, but.  Sam went to go chase down Bob Kelly.  Yeah.  Can someone else come running in here?  Yeah.  Iraq, I don't need you in there if you can do this over here.  I just want to say one more thing about the hotel room thing.  Uh, yeah, I've always felt like this weird guilt thing when I'm in the hallway, uh, alone  and some woman either made is alone and another woman and she's going to the door.  I'll always step back and, and slow down my walk or something and give her the opportunity 
[03:14:00]  to get in and shut the door before I would be, before you are the push your way in guy  like, like, yeah, but they all have, uh, all the, all the hotels have cameras now.  So yeah, yeah, but still, you know, you got a camera coming out, but, you know, I think  and it's more not so I get framed for anything.  I just, I just don't want them to feel uncomfortable like that.  I'm the guy.  Let's be honest.  I don't want to get, you don't want to get framed.  No, no.  Fuck their uncomfortableness.  Honestly, that's the difference between white and black right there. 
[03:14:30]  I don't want to, I don't want to get the look like I'm a fucking rapist look from  the girl.  Like, oh fuck, I better not open this door.  Although I think it's perfectly a great thing for her to do.  Not open the fucking door.  Like any girl that opens a door alone where a guy is in the hallway like that, you're  dumb.  Trust your instincts.  Don't open the door.  Wait for him to go somewhere.  But as a white guy, I'm thinking of, you know, oh, the feelings.  Let me, let me make sure.  Let me make sure that she don't feel me.  You're just thinking, I don't want this bitch to say I pushed the fucking door open.  That's where my mind is. 
[03:15:00]  I hate feeling like you can't be in your own room.  Yeah.  When they're cleaning it.  I'll say like, I got to wait outside my own fucking room because the maid's in there.  Yeah.  Well, I'm not going there.  Sam, what'd you find out about Robert Kelly?  He's doing Tom Papa's interview deal.  Why did he give us the fuck you look, though?  That's what he said.  I said, he was over.  Tom Papa's what?  He's doing an interview show, Tom Papa.  Like, he interviews comedians.  He did Seinfeld.  He did, well, he also did Rob Zombie.  When is he going to do Patrice O'Neill?  That's what Patrice is saying right there.  Dude, you know what, dude?  I've done enough. 
[03:15:30]  I've done enough.  I've done enough fucking some, another in-depth discussion with Patrice O'Neill and his viewpoints.  Shut up, Tom.  But why was he walking like you?  Go ref marriages, asshole.  Tom Papa.  I guess, I guess that's how guests walk when they're not doing our show.  Well, he, he actually.  These guys slump down the hall because they know they're doing our show.  You see the confidence as he was walking by?  Well, it was because, it's because, you know what?  It was really good to see Bobby go, hey, guys, got to do something else.  He acknowledged your existence. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  He was like, all right.  He wanted us to notice that he had other things to do.  Because he knows everybody, all the regulars got to, you know.  He was acting like.  He got to demotion.  So, he just wants to let everybody know.  He was acting like a chick.  He really was.  That was a chick move.  Yeah.  Yeah, but.  Look what I'm doing.  Can you fucking.  He's a, he's a guy.  We're just making jokes.  He's a guy who comes here three times a week.  Now, he wants to just let you know, life moves on.  I have other shit. 
[03:16:30]  I have other shit, motherfucker.  Other shit in the pipe.  Yeah, you got to know that.  All right, listen.  Other shit in the pipe.  He wasn't even in a rush because he spent five minutes taking a picture with the mob wives.  Exactly.  Oh, God.  Why the fuck didn't he come in and say hi?  Because as soon as he passed your window, he slumped over again.  He probably did.  He didn't even.  Let me tell you something.  He didn't have to come this way.  No, he could have avoided us.  He could have went the other way.  He wanted us to see.  Oh, he did.  He wanted us to see him with other people around here.  Dude, come here, dude. 
[03:17:00]  I'm doing an interview show.  No, I'm not here for, I'm not here for any.  Yeah, yeah.  I got my own shit going on.  There's all the guys that do our show regularly.  They're in this building.  We never knew it.  Yeah.  And then they go, oh, yeah, I was, I was there, but I had something going on on the  outside.  Oh, yeah, you should have popped in.  Right.  Here's the Dalai Lama walks into a pizza shop.  This is everywhere, man.  Let's just play it.  Then we'll talk about it in a few minutes.  Now, as you know, I did share a gag with Dalai Lama because he was in such fine form. 
[03:17:30]  I decided that I would tell this gag.  Now, it did prove to be not my most successful ever.  Check it out.  So, the Dalai Lama walks into a pizza shop.  What's that?  Pizza shop.  Pizza?  He's telling you to the Dalai Lama.  Yeah, pizza shop.  Didn't know what a pizza shop was.  And says, can you make me one with everything?  What's that?  What's that?  That's hilarious.  Pause, pause.  Pause.  Do you know what I mean?  Pause.  You know what I mean?  When I heard about this, I wanted to, like, call this guy out for being the biggest asshole, 
[03:18:00]  but I fucking love this guy.  That's hilarious.  And it's a great joke.  Could you make me one with everything?  It's hilarious.  And the Dalai Lama's like, what?  What?  What?  Huh?  What?  What?  He didn't even know what a pizza shop was.  Pizza shop?  Yeah, back it up to the punchline.  Goddamn.  Yeah, absolutely.  And he's trying to explain it to the Dalai Lama.  Yeah.  What's that?  What's that?  Do you want something to do?  Oh, yes.  Do you know what I mean? 
[03:18:30]  Can you make me one with everything?  Oh, I knew that wouldn't work.  This is one of the greatest things I've ever seen.  That's hilarious.  It takes balls to do this to the Dalai Lama.  The Dalai Lama's an ass.  Like, is funny in your religion?  There's no funny.  No funny in the Dalai Lama's life. 
[03:19:00]  Jesus, Captain Sirius?  There's no funny in everything, I guess.  No.  Right?  I guess he's above the actual fact that he's a joke.  He's a part of a joke.  Hey, it's like you go, two Jews walk in a bar and it's two Jews and they're going, I don't  know.  Wait a minute.  What's going on here?  They were on their way into a bar at the time.  I don't like the fact that he had to be explained what a pizza shop is.  Well, he's the Dalai Lama.  Dalai Lama doesn't know what a pizza shop is.  He eats cloud meat.  We saw him in an elevator once in Atlanta.  We bring it up every fucking time. 
[03:19:30]  This guy shouldn't know what a pizza shop is.  It's an elevator.  He's all over the place.  All of a sudden, we found ourselves in an elevator with a Dalai Lama.  You had to take a picture.  No.  Norton would have taken a picture.  We were even supposed to look him in the eye or something.  We looked him in the eye.  I didn't even know you were supposed to do that.  Did you turn into stone?  You're not supposed to be on a level higher than him or something.  I don't know.  Yeah, we were in an elevator.  I think I would go, Dolly, what's your deal?  Why would they let us assholes in with the Dalai Lama?  No, dear. 
[03:20:00]  Why were we allowed in that elevator that day?  I don't know.  It's not like we were Chinese.  No, the Chinese don't really like him.  He's been around a long time.  He's retiring, I think.  The Beatles were into him in the 60s.  This guy is ageless.  But how do you retire if that's your gig?  You can't retire from that.  You can retire from helping people be religious.  All right, continue.  He laughed more at the fact that it didn't work.  He didn't know what pizza was. 
[03:20:30]  He didn't know what's going to fall down there, isn't he?  You know that a joke's in trouble if you've got a translator off to the side.  He didn't know what pizza was.  I've got better having spoken to him.  Spoken.  And I think everyone who talks to him does.  I'm so surprised he ain't fired, though.  Yeah.  Well, it's Australia.  You should have said the lot.  One with the lot.  One with the lot.  Oh, the lot.  I think it was a handbag.  You know what?  It's not the joke.  You're fucking...  It's refreshing that they're showing some real feelings about the whole thing. 
[03:21:00]  If this happened on America TV, they'd all be in life.  Yeah, that's Australian.  They do blackface still in Australia.  They have no political correctness.  It was a real moment.  Can I get one?  The Dalai Lama walks to the pizza shop and says, can I get one with everything?  One with everything.  Can you make me one with everything?  Can you make me one with everything?  Can you make me one with everything?  But I think his humor doesn't get mocking his fucking actual...  The fact that making you one with everything.  He goes, I don't get it.  He didn't get it.  He doesn't understand irony or... 
[03:21:30]  No.  No.  Like, it just doesn't exist to him.  Irony is dumb to the Dalai Lama.  It's just a stupid theory.  He doesn't know...  I wonder what makes him laugh.  Probably just really visual things.  Like just a monkey clapping.  I bet you...  A monkey clapping.  I bet you he rolls at the Three Stooges.  Three Stooges.  Yeah.  Fucking Moe hitting Larry on the head with a ball-peen hammer.  He loves kitten stuff on the internet.  Anything with kittens.  Can I say that?  I just have to say that the greatest Three Stooges bit of all time, please, is... 
[03:22:00]  Shemp has the...  Shemp has the fishbowl on his head.  And he's going...  He's going...  And Moe goes...  Hey, Larry, what do you say?  Larry goes...  A ball-a-ball-ball!  And Moe slaps the shit out of him.  A ball-a-ball-a-ball!  What do you say?  A ball-a-ball-a-ball!  Bow!  Funniest...  Funniest Three Stooges bit of all time!  Of all time! 
[03:22:30]  I was petrified of Moe as a kid.  Moe was an asshole.  Moe was, like, so violent and scary to me.  Like, Larry was funny.  Why would you hang out with Moe after a while?  What a fucking asshole.  He would beat the piss out of everybody.  For the dumbest thing.  Right.  Like, Moe would get hit accidentally with shit.  Like, all the other guys would hit him accidentally, and then Moe would lose his shit and intentionally  punch him.  But you never saw, like, Larry intentionally hit Moe.  Like, hey, you're an asshole.  I'm going to fucking punch you.  Or do the eyeball thing. 
[03:23:00]  They are...  They have the most interesting story of all times, dude.  Oh, the real story behind him?  The real story of the Three Stooges.  Yeah.  Just misery.  Yeah.  Just fucking misery.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, man, I appreciate you having me on.  Patrice, I got to go, too.  And, uh...  They were all going.  Yeah.  I'll see you probably in October.  What?  No, you've got to be as soon as I am.  What's today?  Oh, man.  Fuck you.  Patrice is giving us some shit, man.  I'm giving you shit.  At least I'm not walking happily by the window. 
[03:23:30]  You know what?  You are absolutely right.  I'm fucking with you.  You ain't been here in a while.  You're invited back any time.  Oh, the open invite.  You got the open invite.  I'll fucking...  I'll take one of these TVs looking to throw something.  He's looking around for something he can throw.  I always hated that one.  No, you got an open invite.  What does that mean?  No one ever calls you out on the open invite.  It allows you the pop-in. 
[03:24:00]  Like Ant says that.  You're welcome any time.  That's why I can't go to Ant's house when he has these things.  Yeah, because I...  It's like, come any time.  It's like, Ebony didn't tell me to come to his house.  Hey, Ant.  Come on by.  I know he'll let me in, but...  No, I always do this.  When I'm having a party, I always tweet.  I tweet, like, anyone who's ever been to a party at my house or knows that they would  be invited, that, you know, I have invited, I'm having a party.  And that means everybody that's been invited.  That makes sense. 
[03:24:30]  But you had to get to that point where people...  Because I don't send out invites.  You had to get to that point where people were at your house for parties.  Yeah, Patrice knows.  If he gets the tweet fucking bat signal, then I'm having a party.  I don't know.  Like, I have you on Twitter.  I follow you.  I know Ope's thing is videos and information.  Your thing is an argument.  Yes.  I'm constantly arguing and guns. 
[03:25:00]  What's your thing, then?  My thing is I got into this real good tweet groove where I only tweet when I feel like it.  I don't want to over-tweet or under-tweet.  But when I really think, I feel compelled to tweet.  And then I'll try to be funny and I'll try to say this is fucked up, you know, with the  Schwarzenegger thing.  I had a good bunch of tweets and get people arguing and shit and talking about fucking  side bitches.  And then the NBA Finals.  But right now, I wouldn't tweet about, like, Tracy Morgan because you can't do a 140-character 
[03:25:30]  explanation of some of those things.  You can't be frivolous with Twitter.  You ever start a tweet and you're like, I just can't fit?  Cancel.  Can't fit it.  You know what Twitter needs?  Some type of technology where you're allowed a thousand characters five times a month.  You know what I mean? 
[03:26:00]  Because if you expand the characters, it's going to blow up Twitter.  It's going to suck.  But allow each person that has an account like a few times where they could go all out.  But with all the accounts, you would constantly be scrolling through giant every day.  I don't click on that twit longer and all that.  Fuck that, man.  If I don't see it in front of me.  If that tweet ain't there, it ain't that late.  I don't go for two clicks ever.  Unless it's a video, obviously.  Video, photo, something like that. 
[03:26:30]  But when you know it's not a video and it's a continuation of a tweet, rarely.  No.  That's where they lose me.  My girl hates my tweets because I tweet down to like eight characters left.  And then I put dot, dot, dot until it's one.  And you can't retweet that.  Yeah, you can't retweet.  You can't retweet it.  Because that's the problem, too.  You want people to retweet your shit, so you've got to leave some extra characters for them so they can retweet it.  So they don't go into the twit longer bullshit.  And these motherfuckers, they've got these motherfuckers who have like a newspaper thing that is like... 
[03:27:00]  I did that for a while.  The Dude Gazette.  Oh, right, yeah.  And it's set up like...  The Dude Gazette.  And I thought it was real for like a half a second.  Yeah, all it is is your page just organized differently.  Oh, I didn't know that.  I was doing that for a while.  It was kind of cool.  I had a CNN.  Maybe I should go back there.  I had a blurb in the CNN, Tracy Morgan thing, by the way.  Yeah.  By the guy's name.  He's a black guy, but he's like the only black guy.  Oh, the black Roland.  Roland Martin.  He had a great take on that.  We were talking about that yesterday. 
[03:27:30]  I was in a big...  His I'm his thing, it bothers me a little bit, but he explained himself.  Saying that I wasn't considered a shock jock type personality when he did what he did.  He had a lot of powerful people on his show.  That's why that wasn't accepted by a lot of people.  I would still argue that point with him, but the rest of it I thought was really right on.  Yeah, he had a big long thing about Tracy.  Big long thing.  But he had all his names, but then he actually quoted something from The Elephant in the Room.  Yes, he did.  Which was the raw, fucking raw thing. 
[03:28:00]  Right, right.  But you could have picked something better than that, but...  You were right in the middle of that article.  But it's hilarious, because he's saying, well, why ain't nobody fucking with me?  You know what I mean?  But it's like, because I'm making a point that you can argue.  Yeah.  You can't just go, I'm a fucking...  Right.  He's promoting AIDS.  Right.  And then if they did, I'd probably go, yeah, why not?  Magic's is okay.  Magic's fine with it.  I'll take his AIDS.  All he's getting now is like a little bit of bad skin, but no lesions. 
[03:28:30]  He's looking pretty good.  He got the good AIDS.  He got the AIDS that makes him a good businessman.  Yeah.  Get a good job.  I'm surprised my fucking...  Fucking matricious.  They don't...  Magic made people unscared of AIDS.  Yeah, it really did.  It's like, oh, you're not even going to lose weight.  Got a shot.  And normal publications are showing, are letting us, saying that AIDS is a cure.  Yeah.  The Economist got something.  Like, actual...  Yeah, they're saying that they're...  Do you believe that shit, that they're holding that back for a while? 
[03:29:00]  If they were...  That's one of the conspiracies, that they already have a cure, but they're just kind of holding  it back for whatever reason.  But AIDS is not a thing.  It's like, why would you cure AIDS if you really wasn't trying to?  Because it's one of those diseases where you can live long and have it.  So, they love diseases like that.  They don't like Ebola.  It costs money to fucking keep taking those drugs for 20, 30 fucking years.  So, that's like, Ebola is like...  Like, the common cold is a fantastic thing to have. 
[03:29:30]  Where you just, you're sick, and you gotta buy...  A dumb doctor's visit, even though you don't have to.  You gotta buy a fuckload of medicine, over-the-counter shit.  But how much fucking do you think is gonna happen if they actually cure AIDS?  Yeah.  Or get a vaccine?  Bath houses come back.  That's a...  A lot of ass fucking.  That's where I'm in with the conspiracy shit, by the way.  What you just said.  That's when I start getting suspicious.  You're in.  Why don't you just...  Why don't you go full in? 
[03:30:00]  I don't know.  I think you are.  Because you are in.  Yeah, I think you're in.  I'm in.  You fucking believe in these things.  Nah, the 9-11 shit, I can't buy it to.  But that's okay.  The 9-11 shit, I could easily...  I wonder what the government knew as far as the planning and what they did to...  You can't embrace the idea of motherfuckers actually flying planes in the...  Like, we did it and all that shit.  No, not at all.  But I...  No way.  I get suspicious.  What did the government know and what did they allow to happen for whatever reason? 
[03:30:30]  That's all conspiracy theories are, is you hear...  But as far as now, man.  As far as what?  We doing it to ourselves?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the way some of these guys say?  No way.  Just listen.  No fucking way.  Just for a second, though.  Here's the thing.  If you go to the Lusitania, you go to Pearl Harbor, you go to the Gulf of Tonkin, we need  reasons sometimes to get into these wars.  Yeah.  And we didn't have...  We didn't get into the wars until... 
[03:31:00]  Patrice, you're explaining basic shit to me.  I get that.  What you're saying is...  What I'm saying is, we said as the government, we're going to get out of your way and let  you do what we know you're going to do because now we can do what we want to do.  Yes.  That's what I'm saying.  You don't believe that?  I do believe that.  I do believe that's a possibility.  Yes.  Okay, so then the thing you don't believe is what?  That we actually, you know, did it to ourselves.  Orchestrated the whole thing.  Yeah.  Oh, that we...  Al-Qaeda wanted to do this.  We knew they were going to do this and we went, holy shit.  Oh, yeah, that's the theory.  If we allow them to do this, now we get to do what we want to do. 
[03:31:30]  That's right.  I believe that.  That's where I'm at.  That's a possibility.  And I'm not saying that...  So you're a conspiracy theorist, Scott.  No, I'm suspicious of that because I don't even know if that's the case here.  I'm going to stop saying suspicious of this and I'm all in, Opie.  I don't know if that's the case here, but I'm willing to open my mind to say that is  a possibility.  Is that fair enough?  I don't know.  Really?  I don't buy it.  I don't know.  I'm going to think about it.  I'm going to tell you when I'm back in November.  I believe we could step...  No, but I...  All of a sudden, when Opie gets serious, he gets serious. 
[03:32:00]  No, no, no, no.  No, because I was just thinking about the point.  That's all.  I didn't hear that.  Well, if you'd like to discuss those things, I'm open.  All right, Petriki.  Big mama prods.  Not a 10-17 mother fucker.  Oh, yeah, because we're going into your show, right?  Yeah, we're cutting into the shit hour.  What does he talk about?  It's about what we talked about.  If you want to hang with him.  With Sam?  I like Sam, but only when other people are around.  Ah, shit.  I can't just hang with Sam and shit.  All right, go find something else, but we'll see you guys tomorrow. 
[03:32:30]  Shit hour.  Yeah, yeah.  The virus.  Sirius XS.  Sirius XS.  I will be retry.  Yo, retry show.  Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it. </pre>
