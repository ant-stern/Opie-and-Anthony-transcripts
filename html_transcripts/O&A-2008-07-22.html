<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie and Jim Norton discussing the cancellation of their show in Buffalo, NY, despite strong ratings.  They speculated on the station's financial difficulties and the lack of a replacement plan, fielding angry calls from Buffalo listeners. The hosts then transitioned to a news story about Britney Spears smoking near her son, followed by a discussion of a YouTube video showing a woman complaining about her divorce despite receiving a substantial settlement.  A substantial segment was dedicated to the documentary "Man on Wire," focusing on Philippe Petit's Twin Towers tightrope walk. Opie and Norton expressed both awe and horror at Petit's feat, analyzing photos and discussing the meticulous planning.  They mentioned upcoming guests: Nick DiPaolo, the Mythbusters (who were in studio to promote Shark Week), and Philippe Petit himself.  The segment concluded with a discussion about a recent Hudson River triathlon where a participant died, potentially from jellyfish stings.

The show then delved into a discussion about sharks, triggered by a claim (deemed false by the hosts) that more people die from vending machines than shark attacks. Opie presented statistics showing lightning strikes are more likely than shark bites for surfers.  A humorous, albeit confusing, exchange followed about alleged video footage of a shark attack. The conversation shifted to shark-related myths, including the use of chili peppers as a repellent. A caller, Coke Logic, asked about a Mythbusters experiment involving a subwoofer and a candle.

A major portion of the broadcast featured a live interview with Jamie and Adam from Mythbusters. They discussed debunked myths, including the ice bullet, fuel efficiency, and the possibility of polishing a turd.  They recounted angry reactions from military personnel after debunking a sniper scope myth and shared anecdotes about insurance limitations on their experiments.  They also touched upon other experiments: a penny dropped from the Empire State Building, a bottle rocket fired from a vagina, and a bug bomb experiment. A listener then called, again expressing anger over the Buffalo cancellation.  The segment concluded with an interview with Scott Rigsby, the first double amputee to complete the Hawaiian Ironman Triathlon, who discussed his accident, prosthetics, training, and motivations. Nick Tappala was mentioned as a guest host, and Philippe Petit's upcoming appearance was reiterated; a scheduling conflict prevented Tappala from participating in a previously planned event.

The next segment featured a second interview with Scott Rigsby, detailing his training regimen and the specialized prosthetics he used for swimming, biking, and running. He described the challenges of competing without legs, mentioning his leg donation to medical research and the pain experienced by amputee soldiers.  The hosts joked about his prosthetics. Rigsby promoted his website, scottrigsby.com, and his Energizer Bunny nomination. This was followed by an interview with Philippe Petit, who described his meticulous planning for his Twin Towers walk, including clandestine visits and using a bow and arrow and fishing line to get the wire across. He discussed his artistic approach and fear of spiders and snakes, mentioning future projects including an Easter Island walk and promoting his documentary, *Man on Wire*, available at manonwire.com.  Comedian Mike DiStefano briefly advertised his show.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Petit's feat and promotional plugs.

The show continued with a discussion about a previous interview with Philippe Petit, focusing on his name pronunciation and ID issues.  This transitioned into a news story about Christian Bale's arrest for assaulting his mother and sister, with speculation focusing on *Dark Knight* comparisons with Heath Ledger. The conversation then returned to the NYC triathlon death, detailing the staggered start and the potential role of jellyfish stings. A call from Scott Rigsby followed, recounting his experiences, including a humorous anecdote about a woman flashing him during a race. He discussed the differing reactions of men and women to his disability.  The show touched on Charles Van Duren's confession of cheating on *Quiz Show* decades later, then returned to the triathlete's death with darkly comedic stories about deaths during unusual activities.  The hosts then discussed two news stories about parents leaving children unattended in hot cars, resulting in one child's death, causing strong outrage and criticism of both the parents and the media's reporting.  The segment ended with Nick DiPaolo recounting his trip to Afghanistan, including a mortar attack and firing a machine gun from a Black Hawk helicopter.

A later segment began with another interview with Scott Rigsby, where the hosts made jokes about bodily functions and racial stereotypes, referencing Patrice O'Neal.  Rigsby discussed his family's reaction to his achievements, his accident, and the support he received.  The conversation shifted to his dating life and the challenges of being a double amputee.  A video of Nick DiPaolo shooting a machine gun was briefly shown.  The segment then involved a series of combative and offensive calls with truck drivers, filled with vulgar and disrespectful exchanges.  Finally, the hosts launched into a highly critical and offensive discussion of Philippe Petit, filled with homophobic and misogynistic slurs and insults, mocking his personality and accomplishments. The show ended with plans for future segments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Things that border on offensive in order to entertain their offense.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Intimacy DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shop jocks, Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it.  Hey, man voice.  Ooh, you're hurting me now.  Yeah, you know I am.  Grandpa, could you whip me up some ovaries?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah, iTunes Apple Store offers slew of programs and games. 
[00:01:00]  How about the game, take picture of genitals, send to friends?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  Now open, open your cheeks up.  I want to hear the sniffing.  Open your cheeks wide.  Shh, shh, shh.  Ah.  Oh, my teeth hurt.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes.  Good morning.  Tuesday, July 22nd.  We are here.  We are alive.  In living color.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Starring Jim Norton.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  You got that, onaradio.com.  And I think we're on in Buffalo today.  We might even be back on in Syracuse today.  But we're not going to be on in Buffalo in the very near future. 
[00:02:00]  What?  Yeah.  I figured I'd tell you live in the air to get a natural reaction from you, Jimmy.  I got a call from our agent yesterday.  And he goes, remember when I told you that you guys were off Syracuse,  but you're going to be on in Buffalo until at least January?  I'm like, yeah.  We weren't happy about it, but it was some backroom deal we made with Citadel Broadcasting,  a radio company that's basically going broke, and we're suffering because of it. 
[00:02:30]  So, all last week we had angry phone calls from Syracuse.  Why aren't you on anymore?  A lot of people pissed off because, you know, this show takes time,  but we definitely find our audience.  He calls yesterday.  He goes, well, now they've decided that you're going to be on in Syracuse,  but you're going to be off Buffalo in the very near future.  We might not even be broadcasting in Buffalo this morning, for all I know. 
[00:03:00]  Why?  I don't know why.  It's the nature of the business lately.  Do we have good ratings in Buffalo?  We have good ratings.  I was going to say very good ratings.  We're doing very well.  Yes.  And for the amount of money they're paying for this show,  this is where it comes down to because it's economics.  For the amount of money they're paying for this show in Buffalo,  they should just leave it alone and let us be.  But they're saying they can't afford it, this and that, blah, blah, blah, 
[00:03:30]  the economy, blah, blah, blah, we can't sell the show because blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Still on in Buffalo, not in Syracuse.  Well, that's going to flip.  So we're talking to people in Buffalo right now, but we're going away,  and then we're going to say hi to Syracuse again within the next day or two.  That's soon?  That is the breaking news I got for everybody out there.  And I know we're in other cities, and you're probably saying, who cares, who cares?  We care.  This whole business is falling apart. 
[00:04:00]  I want to go to Buffalo and do a gig.  Yeah, no kidding.  Oh, well.  Syracuse, here I come.  And believe me when I tell you that they're not paying a lot of money for the show in Buffalo.  We're basically, I mean, basically, we are doing the show for free for Buffalo.  Basically.  Yeah, we're making a few shekels, but nothing to brag about.  It'll pay a couple bills, but that's about it.  No one's getting rich because we're on in Buffalo, New York.  We just love it up there, and we've been, you know, our show's been a part of that area 
[00:04:30]  for many, many years, off and on.  What are they doing?  I don't know.  Silly.  So I got to call Fareed today and, you know, give him a piece of my mind and say, what are  you doing?  And I also found out they don't even have a plan.  They just can't afford the show, so they're taking us off the air with no plan.  So they're probably going to just throw a guy in there to play music.  Perfect.  And that'll cost at least half of what you would pay for a morning show like this. 
[00:05:00]  Not if you just get some guy who does like one shift on a Saturday and say, do you want  to just build your name up a little?  Yeah.  I'm sure it won't cost them much.  And then there's going to be a new market we're adding in the very near future.  Terrific.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Let's see.  What coast is it on?  Where is it?  I don't know.  Wait.  It's like the East Coast.  There's water next to it.  No, it's landlocked.  Is it Los Angeles? 
[00:05:30]  No.  Kind of East Coast landlocked.  Landlocked.  Landlocked.  Jacksonville, Florida?  That's where I want to be on.  Is it a good one or no?  It's all right.  It's all right.  Let me translate for the fans.  No.  Well, when you do a radio show, you want to be in the top 10 markets.  And then like, good news, you're going to be on in market 58.  I just threw 58 out there because these dopes will now look it up.  Well, the market 58 is actually Dayton, Ohio. 
[00:06:00]  They're going to be on Dayton, Ohio.  I don't know.  But it's in the 50s somewhere.  So it's like, oh, that's exciting news, Bob.  Thanks.  How about Los Angeles?  How about San Francisco?  How about Dallas?  How about Buffalo?  How about Buffalo?  How about you keep us on in Buffalo?  Unbelievable.  Let's say hi to Brian really fast.  Brian, listening on the edge, home, the home of Shredder Reagan.  What's going on, buddy?  Oh, not too much, man.  I'm out here working.  Delivering the Buffalo news and kind of disappointed that you guys are going to be going off the radio. 
[00:06:30]  I'm amazed we're even on today.  Maybe they're giving us the chance to say goodbye.  Yeah, a little send-off, huh?  I'm out of my mind about this.  Out of my mind.  It's like, what are you doing?  Absolutely.  What are you doing?  We just had a deal with all these angry phone calls from Syracuse all last week,  and now we're going to go back on Syracuse, but now we're going to get the angry phone calls from Buffalo.  What are they doing? 
[00:07:00]  It ain't going to stop.  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks a lot, buddy.  Have a good one.  All right.  Let's say hi to Brooklyn Ace, a regular to the Opie and Anthony show.  Brooklyn Ace, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Listen, are we safe here in the city?  I mean, is K-Rock okay?  Yes, absolutely.  The ratings came in yesterday, and Stunt Brain, how well did we do?  There's two ratings systems going on.  The old one goes away pretty much starting today.  And the new one starts in September. 
[00:07:30]  Like the second week of September, we get the new currency on the people meters.  Yeah, the electronic ratings, which we've been following for the last six months here in New York,  and we've been killing with the new rating system.  The old rating system, we don't do as well, but we had a very nice book here in New York.  Yes, the summer book or the spring book is out, and according to the 1834s, the 2554s, and the boys listening, we did very well.  And it was really nice growth over all three of those months in the book.  Right on.  Well, thanks to the listeners.  Very cool. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Huh?  Since when have radio executives counted on listeners on our ratings?  Well, then...  I blew the line.  Bye.  All right.  Bye now.  Goodbye.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Big Jim in Buffalo.  Big Jim.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  Man, this is such a crap hole in Buffalo.  Now they're taking away O&A from us, too?  That's such bull, man.  And they don't even have a plan.  They just want to save money.  That's how desperate they are right now.  Trust me.  I mean, if they were paying us a ridiculous amount of money, I would almost understand. 
[00:08:30]  But this show is pretty much being heard for free in Buffalo, as far as we're concerned.  It's a bargain.  There's such hacks that you guys go against in the morning on these other stations, too.  If we have to listen to them, I'll lose my mind, because if you know who you're going against,  it even makes it worse.  Yeah, I'm fully aware of who we go against in Buffalo.  There's nothing going on.  Maybe we could get someone with a bucket, and people could start dropping their change 
[00:09:00]  in a bucket outside the radio station.  Is there anyone's life we could make miserable here to change things, or it's above our heads,  pretty much?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, in all fairness, I know the PD, I don't want to mention his name, but he's  not happy about this decision.  He was left out of the decision.  He was told it comes from way, way up.  You know, he wants the show to continue on the edge.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Well, I'll punch it out, man.  I've only been losing for the year, and I'm upset about the whole decision, man. 
[00:09:30]  So thanks for everything, man.  All right.  Thank you, Big Jim.  Stephen Basher had a good point.  He said, I feel bad for Buffalo.  They're losing the Opie and Anthony show, and it's due to start snowing in five days.  We should have a fundraiser.  I could raise the money that they're paying us in a week.  We should go up there.  In a week, and then go, here, stupid.  Here's your money.  Go up there, do an event.  Right.  Have all the proceeds get donated to the station.  Exactly.  Yeah.  So they could keep us on another few months. 
[00:10:00]  There's really not a tremendous amount of money to be made from some of these markets at all.  It's just the state of radio.  It's getting really, really frustrating.  But I just wanted to tell everybody that, because who knows?  They might take us off before 630.  You never know how this works.  All of a sudden, they just pull the plug on you.  So I guess if people call once we're off, it would help, but I don't know.  Well, maybe they should start calling now and get the word out, because this show is going away in Buffalo.  When?  I don't know.  So I heard we might have the whole week. 
[00:10:30]  Gee, thanks.  What does that do in the end?  Well, you guys, you know, you'll be on until Friday.  Well, thanks.  No, we won't.  Watch what happens in the next few days.  Yep.  I say we're off by Wednesday.  I say we say something before 9 at Rexhead.  No problem.  Get the word out.  We might blow it up today.  Jerks.  I want to stay on in Buffalo, though.  I mean, it's like one of those weird little markets that we just do well in.  We love Buffalo.  We were on another station in Buffalo. 
[00:11:00]  We did really well.  So maybe it's time to start saying hello to those guys again.  I don't remember which one that was.  Well, I don't know what I'm saying.  W.  W.  W.  W.  W.  W.  W.  W.  W.  W.  W.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  We've got a busy show.  Anthony is home sick.  He was sick yesterday, too.  Yeah, he's been sick since the birthday show we did for you on Friday there, Jimmy.  Yeah.  He was going to come out to dinner, and he's like, I'm really not feeling well.  I feel like boozy and dizzy, and he's got like a bad bug. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, he's got a very rare summer flu.  That's kind of creepy.  Yeah.  Who gets the flu in the summer?  I bet you we couldn't find five people with the flu.  I hope that's what it is.  Across America.  I hope it's nothing he was doing, and he wasn't letting us know he was doing.  Yeah.  You know, rest areas.  Things of that nature.  Well, he did say he had a really bad sore throat, so I don't know.  This is my first show as a 40-year-old.  I feel the same as I did on Friday as a 39-year-old.  But don't you feel, like, relieved that it's finally over? 
[00:12:00]  Because when you get those milestone birthdays, you just want it to pass.  Yeah, I feel a little bit more relaxed now.  I was very tense, and there's something depressing about turning 40.  It's just, and then I went to my aunt's wedding, and they sang happy birthday.  And I'm so easily embarrassed that, like, they're all up there looking at the wedding cake, and then I heard, happy birth.  And they're all looking at me, and I just, like, sink in my chair, and they all conga-lined over to me.  The whole wedding party conga-lined to me and sang around me.  It was awful.  Did you jump into the line? 
[00:12:30]  No, I didn't.  I just sat there and nodded.  Like, thanks, you asses.  Yeah, I get really embarrassed really easy, like, with family stuff.  Of course.  And it was nice, but.  We had a good dinner on Friday.  It was great.  It was like celebrities all over the place.  Weird celebrities.  I've never seen so many celebrities I didn't care about in my life.  Right.  I've never in my life.  E-Rock's laughing, but it's the truth.  And I do this thing called Opie's Eye, and during dinner, I was snapping these horrible photos,  because I'm not brave enough to ask for photos. 
[00:13:00]  I just can't do that.  So we got, what, Uncle Junior from The Sopranos.  He was there by himself.  Dominic, what is it, Chianese or Chianese?  Yeah.  He was eating dinner, a really nice steak dinner by himself.  He had a little window seat.  Alone, in a little two-seater.  Yeah.  And he was going around saying hi to people.  I'm sure he would have said hello.  But I wanted to talk to him, and all I wanted to talk about is how much I loved him in Injustice  for All.  Right, right.  Because he was in the first scene of that.  He played Arthur Kirkland's, some guy that was with a hooker and had a car accident. 
[00:13:30]  All he did was get hookers in that, which I loved him in.  I didn't want to mention The Stupid Sopranos.  All I wanted to talk to him about is his small part in that movie.  I'm sure he's sick of talking about The Sopranos.  Of course.  Uncle Junior, dude!  And then we realized that right behind Jimmy at the other table was Meredith Vieira from  The Today Show.  I know who she is.  You know, Matt Lauer's partner there on The Morning Show.  Is she on it now?  Yeah, yeah.  I know her name, but I wouldn't know her.  I didn't recognize her when I saw her.  They do wonders with makeup, because without the makeup, horrific, stunt brain, horrific. 
[00:14:00]  So we got a picture of the back of her head, and then we got a picture of Uncle Junior talking  to Meredith Vieira.  And then to our right was Boomer Esiason and his huge, like, Stonehenge head.  What a massive skull that guy has, with a little thing of blonde hair on it.  Yeah, it could be the biggest head I've ever seen in my life.  And people like that just talk to each other because they're all famous.  Yeah.  It's so weird, slash, having, like, we have fans slash our nobodies. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  It was really weird at our little table, just watching this go on.  Like, Dominic Chinis walked over to Meredith Vieira, and I heard him go, and I'm a fan  of yours.  No, they're not.  Yes, he did say that to them.  No, I know, but they're not fans of each other.  No!  And they just do this back and forth, friendly, hi, I'm kind of famous, and so are you.  Or actually, very famous.  And then Boomer walked over to talk to Meredith.  He goes, I just wanted to come over and say hi.  And it's just acceptable.  I guess if you're a celebrity, you got to just say hi to other celebrities if you're in the 
[00:15:00]  same restaurant.  Yeah.  Because, like, Meredith Vieira and Boomer Esiason would never hang out.  No.  Uncle Junior and Boomer would never hang out, but because they're celebrities, they all  have to, like, mingle and talk to each other.  Did you hear what I said to the waitress?  No.  Waitress comes over.  I'm like, wow, a lot of celebrities here tonight.  As I look around, she goes, yeah, yeah.  I go, and I swear to God, I was joking.  I go, we're famous, too.  And she goes, so am I.  The waitress actually goes, so am I. 
[00:15:30]  Your entrees will be out in a minute.  Like, I'm like, and then I felt like I needed to explain.  And I'm like, ah, just let it go.  Just let it go.  The waitress actually said, so am I.  I just shrunk into my hoodie as Ope said that.  I must have been in the toilet when you said that.  I think secretly I did want her to go, uh, really?  Who are you guys?  But she never, she didn't even, she just goes, so am I.  Like, she didn't recognize us from a hole in the wall, man. 
[00:16:00]  Nothing.  No, it's really bizarre in settings like that.  Like, I know I wanted to say something to somebody, of course.  Like, yeah.  You just feel like you need to say something to somebody.  I want to stand up and go, hi, somebody, please.  But they're all old people in a steakhouse.  It's not our fan base.  Right.  Doesn't mean that they don't have TVs or haven't ever seen the news.  Yeah, we were, uh, we were dining very nice on Friday.  What about the other thing, though?  The, uh, table next to us was celebrating a birthday, too.  Did you hear what I did with that one?  No.  All of a sudden they bring out the dumb dessert with the candle and everyone starts singing 
[00:16:30]  happy birthday.  And, you know, other table, uh, tables will join in.  So our tables sort of joined in singing happy birthday to this complete stranger.  And, uh, I go, uh, in the middle of happy birthday to you.  I yell out, come on, Boomer.  Like, I'm trying to get some.  Because I, because we met him, like, at a golf tournament for Joel Hollander.  So I'm like, all I need is to get a little eye contact.  We interviewed him in Vegas.  I know.  All I need is a little eye contact and be like, whoa, hey, it'll come over and we could 
[00:17:00]  be part of that whole celebrities talking celebrity thing.  And then maybe Uncle Junior will come over.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  But in the middle of the happy birthday song, I'm like, come on, Boomer, like, pipe in.  And then he would turn around like, who's that voice saying that?  And then he would see us like, hey, and there'd be a recognition.  And then we'd fast forward.  We're all just hanging out.  Yeah.  And then Meredith comes over.  Oh, we should do a segment.  Right.  Laughing and toasting.  Right.  Instead of just being a couple of nobodies.  Watching an old man dine by himself, a rock head, and an old lady. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Instead, what did, what did we do?  I go, Jimmy, move your head right now.  So Jimmy would move his head.  I'm making believe I'm taking a picture of Jimmy so I could get an awful picture of Meredith  Vieira's side head.  And then with Kenny, I'm like, Kenny, I'm going to make believe I'm taking your picture.  So if you look at these pictures, they're up on onaradio.com under Opie's eye.  You get Kenny, you get half of Kenny's face and then Uncle Junior in the background.  Because I wasn't even brave enough to just take a picture of Uncle Junior.  I had to make believe I was taking pictures of you guys. 
[00:18:00]  I'm like, Doc, right now.  We should get a camera for Opie's eye.  This way, some of these pictures will come out clearer.  It's tough with a BlackBerry camera to get in a dark setting.  But that's the beauty of it.  Because it's supposed to be just kind of primitive.  So they're up there, whatever.  How lonely does he look?  Just sitting there by himself.  I don't look at that face.  How lonely does he look?  Well, the sad part is it's not even in a diner.  People eat alone all the time in diners and stuff.  But not at a really nice steak joint. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, you wonder if he has friends.  Or if after it went off the air, he can't get anybody to go out with him now.  Right, right.  Sopranos is done.  There's no more cast parties.  People are like, ugh, you're all just going to eat by yourself.  Yeah.  Is he like a lonely old man?  Because old people are aggravating.  Let's be honest.  Nobody wants to eat with them.  They don't have to.  Maybe he lost his wife or something.  I don't know.  Do we have the back story on Uncle Junior?  Or maybe he's never had a wife.  Wink, wink.  Nudge, nudge.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe like him and Ed Koch.  Right.  And they never say it to each other, but they both know. 
[00:19:00]  Sure.  All right, we're just getting warmed up.  We've got a very busy show.  Nick DiPaolo is stopping by today to say hi.  We've got the Mythbusters stopping by today.  We've got Scott Rigsby.  He's the guy I met in Central Park.  He's a double amputee.  The first double amputee to ever finish an Ironman triathlon.  That's just insane.  So we're going to talk to him.  And also, I'm obsessed with this guy as well as Jimmy.  Jimmy's big-time obsessed with this guy, and I'm recently obsessed with this guy. 
[00:19:30]  I'm talking about Philippe Petit, and he'll be on the show today to talk about his little  walk between the Twin Towers back in 1974.  Yeah.  There's a documentary out called Man on a Wire, and I watched it yesterday.  It's horrifying.  We'll explain that next.  We'll talk about the film a little bit after the break.  Okay.  It's Jimmy and I today.  877-212-ON-A.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Dominic Kinesi.  You know me.  I play Uncle Junior on The Sopranos, right?  Yeah.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[00:20:00]  Let's get ready to chuckle!  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  God damn it!  Fuck this show.  Take this fucking show and forget to get fucking fucking fast.  Hey, good morning to everybody. 
[00:20:30]  You got Jimmy and I today.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Front page of the paper today.  You got Brittany's...  Brittany's smoking in front of her kid. 
[00:21:00]  You see this, Jimmy?  No, I'm looking at it now.  Brittany kid's smoke bomb.  We got a lot of parents that are listening to this radio show.  And they can totally relate to this.  This is a no big deal type of thing.  The paparazzi, they got a picture of, quote, hot mama.  Almost hot again, mama.  She's getting there.  Brittany Spears, she's smoking a cigarette, right?  And she's got her little son, Sean Preston, too.  And he's reaching for the cigarettes that happen to be on a little table. 
[00:21:30]  And he's got a lighter in his right hand.  And they're making a big deal out of this picture.  Like she's a bad mom or something.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  The kid's probably just asking her if she needs one or do you want one.  It's so stupid.  Who cares?  If the kid was smoking, that'd be kind of cute, actually.  Well, parents, we could talk to the parents.  But at this age, two years old, this kid doesn't even know that it's a pack of cigarettes and a lighter.  It's just a toy to him. 
[00:22:00]  Well, what if he was saying, Mommy, no more smoking?  And what if he was taking it away from her?  That's a good point, too.  And remember, K-Fed, the ex-husband, used to be the bad guy.  He was the one they were all saying, he's a bad influence on her.  When did this happen?  When K-Fed's music...  Here's what changed us about K-Fed.  When he taught us how to dance.  Pulpa Zow.  I mean, come on.  It's not like you don't love him.  Who doesn't love Pulpa Zow?  Remember when he was on the Team Choice Awards and Brittany introduced him?  It was like she had a rifle.  I've seen hostage videos that were happily, more happily delivered. 
[00:22:30]  She was so...  She so didn't want to do that.  Oh, was she embarrassed to have to introduce that boob?  Yeah.  She's like, my man, Kevin Federline.  It was so painful.  She was pregnant.  She just wanted to have her baby and be left alone.  And then if you go further into the paper, it's very obvious that Brittany is acknowledging  that the kid got her cigarettes and a lighter, and she's basically taking the cigarettes and  lighter away from the kid.  So just nonsense on the front page today. 
[00:23:00]  And then you got this bitch, the YouTube divorce woman.  Yep.  This is good news for the guys there.  She went on YouTube and was bitching and complaining about this guy.  Why she was married to the blonde.  Most people remember this, right?  Do we have any of the audio of this?  This was audio.  Why would we have it today?  We did do this, right?  Yeah, we did do this.  Okay.  I'm trying not to bitch today. 
[00:23:30]  I want to do a lot of bitching today.  I just want the audio.  Yeah, if the broad is on the front page of the paper, don't you think we should have  what?  I've been looking for it all morning.  You're talking to the...  I've been looking for it all morning.  Wait, is she on the...  Well, where did it go?  Is it on YouTube still?  We did like hours on this lady.  Is it still on YouTube?  You're on...  Yeah.  Whatever.  All right.  Whatever.  You guys continue doing what you're doing.  It's great.  Well, she was the lady, because I do remember we heard audio of her, who was like, she was  crying that he's going to put her out in the street, and she was going to be left destitute 
[00:24:00]  or whatever she wanted.  She was appealing to the public, but she came off like a spoiled, rich bitch.  Yeah, she sounded like a complete ass.  Absolutely.  Well, guess what?  She's got to beat it.  She's got 30 days to get out of her really, really nice pad on the Upper East Side here  in New York, and they're saying that the prenup holds.  And they're going to follow the prenup, and she's got to go find somewhere else to live.  Yeah, she was mad that he was throwing her out, but there was a prenup, Shula.  And it's amazing how women will fight a prenup. 
[00:24:30]  I don't understand why, if you sign the document, I guess they assume that there will be a loophole  or that they'll threaten to embarrass the husband, and he'll go against the prenup.  Right.  And the prenup was more than fair.  The amount of money she gets through the prenup is ridiculous.  How much is she getting?  $750,000?  Yeah, she's, woe is me, over $750,000.  And then I'm sure there's other things in there as well.  Yeah, he's happy.  He said, I'm happy with the decision of the judge.  I'm happy with the outcome. 
[00:25:00]  And she obviously didn't think it's the same way.  She said, it's disgusting.  She said, I think it's disgusting.  I'm really, really disappointed with the decision.  She accused Smith of basically throwing me out on the street.  Right.  Like, with $750,000, you can't either rent a nice place or put a down payment on a great  place and then get a job.  Prostitution.  I mean, it's like you forget that that is actually, that could be a fine bridge between  an unpleasant divorce and a new life.  Sure.  Like, you could hook for a little while. 
[00:25:30]  Women are never going to starve.  Right.  You could always do that.  If I get fired from here or I can't do stand-up, I'm in trouble.  You could do a little hooking, though.  I don't know.  I don't have a good enough body.  I would love to think I'm way thin enough.  But older men tend to prefer twinks.  But I'm almost at a point where I can be like a silver dad.  What's a silver dad?  Funny you should ask.  That's a term that the older gay guys use.  Like, for older, younger, they have like these dad-son thing.  It's so creepy sounding.  Impulsive.  Like a silver dad. 
[00:26:00]  So, what?  You got a little gray hair?  I'm guessing gray hair.  And you like the...  Yeah, like a youngster.  Not an underage youngster.  I mean, 20 to 25 or a silver dad.  I'm guessing it would be in his 50s or a mid-year-old.  Silver dad in his 50s, gray hair, and he likes to...  Yeah, silver bear.  Yeah, it's a little gross.  That's just wonderful.  A lot of man-to-man kissing.  Man on the wire.  Philippe's...  I'm obsessed now with Philippe Petit.  Or, you know, in America, he's called Philippe Petit. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  And he's a creepy French brother.  Stupid French.  Have to make everything sound good.  But, by the way...  Philippe Petit.  As much as we give the French crap about being like,  ah, they're cowards because they're military.  The two craziest son of a bitches are him and Alain Robert.  Right.  These daredevils are always French.  Yeah, we like to think the French are a little, you know, swishy.  But they do some crazy daredevil things.  So, you really should look up men on the wire.  And, I don't know.  If you're into this daredevil stuff, it's a really, really good documentary. 
[00:27:00]  And we got Philippe Petit coming in within the hour.  And I saw it yesterday.  And I'm just horrified by what this guy did back in 1974.  Horrified.  Philippe Petit was like a street magician.  And, you know, he did some of this tightroping.  And he decided...  He was in the dentist's office or something?  Yeah.  When he was a little kid.  Yep.  And he's getting like a root canal or something.  And he sees a magazine where they're showing that they're building, like,  the tallest buildings in the world here in New York. 
[00:27:30]  Or at least they got the plans.  And in the end, it's going to be the biggest building in the world.  And at that moment, he claims, which is a little far-fetched,  but we'll go with it, that someday he's going to tightrope across the two buildings.  And he said he stole the ad.  Like, he ripped the ad out of the magazine.  Yeah.  And he actually didn't even go through his appointment.  He actually left the dentist's office.  Yeah.  Because it was a drawing, a mock-up in the magazine of these two buildings.  It's kind of believable.  Because as a tightrope guy, it's almost like if you see a photo of two giant... 
[00:28:00]  Because tightrope walkers don't normally get two massive buildings of the same height.  Right.  If you see that as a tightrope walker, that probably is your first thought.  I'm like, wow, that would be great to make an answer to myself in between those two things.  And he did a little tightrope between the two, what would you call them?  The two towers at Notre Dame?  How high is that?  Not as high as the Twin Towers, but it's pretty impressive.  He did that.  He did something down in Sydney across the bridge.  Right, right, right.  That huge bridge down there.  All these weird landmark places.  Right, right.  And, you know, you fast forward a couple decades, they build the Twin Towers, 
[00:28:30]  and he decides to do it.  And the planning that went into this was years and years of meticulously planning  for this tightrope across the Twin Towers.  And the documentary is amazing.  He's a little swishy.  He's very animated, but a bit swishy.  But he's not gay because he was with that chick for a long time.  Because you watch it, you go, is this guy...  I don't think he is.  I think he's just...  That's what I was...  I was asking that same question yesterday when I was watching it with some people.  Because I always think of, like, my friendship with you, Jimmy. 
[00:29:00]  And I'm like, I've never given Jimmy a piggyback ride before.  I've lost him.  Remember?  Because all of a sudden they're just laughing and they're running in the field together.  I'm like, I don't...  I guess I should explain further.  Like, he had a whole crew of people.  And, you know, they would do the tightroping with these landmarks and stuff.  And it's not just Philippe Petit.  He has a crew that sets up the tightrope and makes sure everything goes smoothly.  And they train and all this. 
[00:29:30]  And they had this, like, this big, huge field wherever the hell he's from.  And they would set up the tightrope and they would practice there.  And next thing you know, they're just running in the field with each other  and tackling each other.  And then there's another scene where Philippe Petit is getting a piggyback ride from his pal.  And every time one of these things happen, I'm looking to my right like,  what's up with Philippe?  Why would you do that in a field?  Just high-five or shake hands or say, good job.  Have we ever ran together in a field and kind of rolled around together, Jimmy?  No. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, exactly.  No, we always walk slow when we're together.  It's almost gay to speed it up.  It's actually called man on wire.  Man on wire.  Man on wire is the instinct to say it because that's what he was charged with.  Right, man on wire.  Yeah, man on wire is what that talks.  That's how they wrote it up back in the day.  And Philippe Petit, it should be a good interview because he's very animated.  He's a weird guy.  I guess you have to be kind of weird to want to do that and then to go through with it.  Right.  But if you're afraid of heights, the photos, because there was unfortunately no video of it. 
[00:30:30]  There's one video from the street where you see this dot in between the buildings.  Literally a dot.  But look, I'm looking at the photos again.  It's called manonwireoneword.com and you can see some photos.  And just looking at these photos, I'm just horrified all over again.  The guy, when he finally got this tightrope set up, he went across back and forth, back and forth.  He was up there on this wire for close to two hours.  He lays down and starts looking at, quote, the heavens. 
[00:31:00]  And he saw a bird above him and he's trying to get the bird to come down to his level.  There's another shot where there's like a plane that looks like he could almost touch it because the plane is, you know, they fly pretty low over Manhattan.  Yeah, it was probably a LaGuardia Airport plane and it was above him.  Right.  And there's a shot taken.  I don't know if it's from the ground, but it shows him and it shows a plane above him.  And, yeah, he's just laying there.  Yeah.  He laid down on the wire.  And then he sits down on the wire.  And I'm thinking, all right, you sit down on the wire.  How the hell do you get up without falling? 
[00:31:30]  But he looked down.  He said he wanted to see the, I mean, we're saying everything he's probably going to say, but he sat down on this thing.  And there's a way to balance yourself.  I think his foot was actually dangling down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And his one foot, it's like picture yourself sitting on a rope and your right foot is balanced on the rope.  And then your left foot is kind of like hanging straight down at the bottom of the queue.  Right.  And he just stopped and he looked to the ground.  Yeah, he leaned over to look, too.  Because he said it was a view he'd never have again.  And he wanted to see it.  The detail that went into this, I mean, they got fake building IDs. 
[00:32:00]  They snuck.  It turned out to be at least a half a ton of equipment they snuck into the Twin Towers.  And then they had to get it up there.  And then there were security guards.  And they hid under a tarp for like hours and hours while the security guard was kind of in the area.  They weren't sure if he was still in the room.  So they stayed there for hours.  Yeah.  And then in the middle of the night, they were able to set up this tightrope.  And how they did it, they shot an arrow.  And this is all the stuff that's explained in the documentary and took a lot of training. 
[00:32:30]  But basically, they shot a bow and arrow with a fishing line from one tower to the other.  That's crazy.  And then on the end of the fishing line, then they had like a small piece of rope, basically.  And they pulled that across.  And then when they had the rope across, then they were able to get something a little heavier.  And they pulled that across.  And then finally, the actual tightrope wire, they were able to pull across.  Once they had a rope big enough under it.  Right. 
[00:33:00]  And I'm so stupid all these years.  Because I always knew that they used a bow and arrow.  Because I heard that years ago.  And I'm such a dope.  I always assumed that they hooked up the tightrope wire and fired it across.  It never occurred to me that you'd have to work your way up to it.  Yeah.  No kidding.  That's kind of heavy.  How did they actually fire that on an arrow?  Yeah, because I think they also said that at one point they dropped the wire or something.  And it took hours and hours to pull it back up.  Because that's how heavy it is.  What, did it fall off the building?  Something like that, I believe.  Yeah.  If I was paying attention.  Yeah.  And they actually, there's so many, there's a photo right there. 
[00:33:30]  He's just sitting on the edge of the Twin Towers.  Or one of the buildings.  On the top of the towers, it was always, I mean, it's like a giant rectangle.  And on the top, it angled inward slightly.  And I think, Stunt Brains, that's where the rigging for the window washing was hooked up.  And maybe that's a 10 or 12 foot angle going up.  And he's just leaning back against it with literally his foot six inches from the edge of the building.  And there's nothing for him to grab onto in front of him.  Yeah.  It's only him leaning back, which is preventing him from falling. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  It's horrifying every time I think about this.  And then finally, dawn hit and he started his tightrope walking.  I'm looking at that picture.  I have such a, my hands get sweaty when I look at things like this.  Right.  And it's just certain photos that are really creepy because they give you a relative, you can see how far from the ground he really is.  Why would you stand there?  I just want to say, why are you standing there?  Why don't you go inside like a nice person?  But he trained for years.  He was kind of spying on the Twin Towers for a while. 
[00:34:30]  He would come to America and really, really study how people got in and out of the building.  He was able to get upstairs and he was on the roof by himself.  He actually made believe he was a French reporter when the Twin Towers were opening and he was able to interview all these people that gave him a lot of inside info.  And then he goes back to somewhere in France.  And then he sets up this whole field to mimic the Twin Towers, like the distance it would be and all this stuff. 
[00:35:00]  And then he was on the wire practicing.  He had his friends with ropes, like moving the wires as hard as they can.  And their whole job was to try to knock him off.  He was only about, what, 15 feet off the ground, something like that.  And they couldn't knock him off the wire.  That's how good he was at doing this.  Well, yeah, in case of crosswinds, I mean, even if it's a nice day, there's still unpredictable things, especially at that height.  I mean, we've all been on top of a tall building before.  Right.  And you're always kind of worried.  And there's one photo in the – it was in the documentary.  I don't know if it's in this book I have.  It was in the documentary where the wind can be so bad up there. 
[00:35:30]  He's holding on to a piece like a flagpole.  He's in the middle of the roof.  Yeah.  And his legs are straight out.  What's the word the way a flag would be?  It's not perpendicular, whatever the word would be.  But he's being blown almost straight out like a flag.  Yeah.  Because at that height –  Oh, like a flag.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah, she's being blown out like a flag.  Because at that height, the wind is so strong or can be so strong.  So that was one of the problems.  They were worried about the wind, obviously.  And then there's another picture where he's kind of like – they're all like shirtless. 
[00:36:00]  And one of his buddies is in bed while he's doing sketches on the other side of the room.  And once again, I'm thinking, wow, have I ever been in the same bedroom with Jimmy topless while he's in bed?  I will say –  Like, I don't – and he had a long-term relationship that ended after he did the walk.  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  Well, she probably had enough tightrope and she's like, enough about the rope.  We know the sky.  We get it. 
[00:36:30]  I think she got sick of looking the other way.  God.  He's getting another piggyback ride.  He probably said, I'm done with this.  Years ago, I was working with Jay Moore in Florida.  And he goes, come in, come in, come in.  And he called me into his hotel room.  And I walked in and he's just on his bed naked with his face in the pillow and his hands behind him.  Let's just say, making a nice presentation.  And I walk in and it's like a cyclops just staring at me.  So, guys do do weird homoerotic funny things like that. 
[00:37:00]  Well, that's the famous –  That's funny, yeah.  That's the famous thing we talk about from time to time, gay or funny.  Yeah.  Philippe Petit, there's nothing funny about, I don't know, rolling around in a field with another guy.  Well, those were –  Or getting a piggyback ride.  Weren't those reenactments like – a lot of it's done in reenactments, I think, the older –  No, that's real footage from back in the day.  That's the only video they got.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that was a young Philippe Petit.  Because I know they did use some actors to play, to reenact certain moments. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  I was hoping maybe that was a reenact, but maybe he just said, be festive, run around the field.  That's what they did.  So then the other thing really fast – so then he's doing his walking across the – just saying it, across the Twin Towers.  It's like 200 feet, 200-some-odd feet.  And then he was just toying with the police and stuff.  Like he would get really close to them and he'd go, uh-uh.  And then he would go back the other way.  He starts smiling.  He – what did he do?  Those French, they like to do the –  A bow? 
[00:38:00]  Like a salute.  He was saluting New York and everything.  What is it called?  I'm not sure.  A curtsy?  You take your hand like this.  It's open.  And you're just to the right.  It's like a gesture of, uh –  But you're saluting, like you're giving respect to –  Like when you're trying to get one side of the stadium to yell, you go, over here.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like slowly backhanding a child.  That's the best way I can think of it.  But I have to ask you a question.  They were up all night.  They were hauling all this equipment up.  They didn't sleep.  Right.  And then he gets up at dawn. 
[00:38:30]  So it's like staying up all night.  Oh, I think he –  Doing all kinds of labor.  And then you walk across a wire for two hours?  Yeah, I think his adrenaline took over.  I don't think he left the –  I think at that point, yeah, they stayed there all night.  Oh, yeah.  It's amazing.  We bitched about being tired on a Monday.  Right.  We got to do radio today.  Three hours of sitting down.  I'm exhausted.  Yeah.  I mean, the things I found amazing about it –  Because I've been kind of looking at this off and on for many years.  And Jimmy reintroduced me to this whole thing a few months ago.  And what a coincidence that the movie came out.  Because we felt like we were talking about something that no one talks about anymore. 
[00:39:00]  But now people are talking again because of this new documentary.  I really thought it was like just a bag with a rope in it and that's it.  When they said in this documentary that it was over a half ton of equipment, I'm like,  how the F did they get that up there?  It's amazing.  You'd never get even close to the building – close to an elevator today with any of that stuff.  But you know what, though?  They had security back then.  They even had building IDs and things to have duplicated. 
[00:39:30]  And it's funny.  I was just thinking.  That's why we had that silence for a second there.  Penn, when he was in – Penn Jillette actually said the day of that walk,  one of his friends said, do you want to come down?  There's a guy going to cross the towers today.  He could have went and watched that live.  Wow.  And he didn't.  He said he was new to New York.  I don't remember why he didn't.  He was like, ah, you know.  Right.  I'm sure he regrets it.  But he could have actually went down and seen that live.  The biggest shame of this whole thing is there's no freaking video.  Yeah.  And I'm surprised because some of his other things were videotaped. 
[00:40:00]  I'm surprised that he didn't think to get some kind of camera up there.  Yeah.  I know they were big and bulky back in 74.  But, you know, they have video of him, like, crossing, you know, across Notre Dame.  Or Notre Dame.  Were those videos he took, though?  Were those things that other people took of him?  Because I wonder, too, if he had the cameras to do that,  why didn't he just bring it up with him and set it up?  Right.  It's a stationery.  Because all you get is pictures, which is a shame.  Could you imagine seeing video of this?  I would pass out. 
[00:40:30]  It was probably like everybody thought that somebody else brought the video camera.  Yeah.  And they all looked at each other and go, we don't have anything.  All right, you got a camera?  Yeah.  Took a few stupid pictures.  Although the pictures are good, and the way the documentary is done,  I mean, there's enough photos in it and enough of him talking.  It keeps you interested.  Well, he's very animated.  He makes it.  Yeah.  He really makes the documentary because he's good with words.  The other thing, really fast, too, this was a downhill,  like the rope was on an incline or decline, depending on which way you're going. 
[00:41:00]  Well, one of the buildings is a little higher than the other.  Right, right.  So it wasn't even like an even.  The rope wasn't even.  He had to go down and then up slightly.  We've talked about this on the show where the greatest fear is like I would always think,  hey, is that an actual photo of his foot, Iraq?  No, it's an artist.  Okay.  Could you show that again?  Because we're looking at black and white photos,  and there's an artist's rendition of what his foot looks like from his point of view,  like if you look down and saw the foot. 
[00:41:30]  Get the F out of here.  Like the building, like the ground below you, if you look down at your own feet.  And what would happen if you were in the middle of the wire,  and all of a sudden you just realized, like, I don't know how to tightrope walk.  And you just stuck.  Like all of a sudden you came out of the haze, and you were in the middle of the wire.  Right.  It's like, is there a way to kind of just get down and grab it?  Because even the guy, one of the Wallendas, Carl Wallenda, couldn't grab the rope when the wind started up.  Well, the problem was he got too old.  Yeah, he's in his 70s.  That's what scares me about Philippe Petit, because then he's like, he's got to be, maybe we can look up his age. 
[00:42:00]  He's got to be 60 by now.  I don't know.  Yeah, that was, what, 28?  30, 34 years ago, Jimmy.  94.  He's got to be close to 60, if not.  And he's still doing some tightroping.  And I'm thinking now his skills are diminished, just kind of like, just imagine like old golfers, old major league pitchers.  He doesn't have the skills like he had when he was in his 20s or 30s, but the mind is still there.  And I have a feeling that he's going to do something stupid and he's going to fall to his death. 
[00:42:30]  Well, he does a lot of benefits now.  Like, he does stuff in like Washington Square Park, where he'll like, you know, just five, six feet off the ground.  Yeah, little cute things.  Might break an arm if he falls.  Yeah, you know, perhaps spill his drink.  I mean, that's the crap that I would do.  But I think he's the type of guy that I think he really wants to do one more biggie.  I really think that he wants to do something.  But what is there to walk between?  After that, I don't know.  That's just crazy.  Yeah, how do you follow that?  Just like, you know, let it go.  He has, too.  He's pretty much kept his mouth shut for 34 years.  Right.  He's 59, so. 
[00:43:00]  Now he's doing a documentary.  It's like, you know, it sucks because 9-11 happened for a lot of reasons.  But, I mean, unfortunately, it wasn't before then.  And why wait so many years?  Like, why not just do this in 1980?  I don't know.  Why are you doing this documentary so many years later?  Well, we'll find out.  He's going to be here in a few minutes.  Let's just scream at him when he comes in for trespassing.  Yeah, let's just scream at him.  Are you gay?  Why the piggybacks?  It's funny.  Why the frolicking in the fields?  Do we find the audio of that lady? 
[00:43:30]  All right.  All right.  Uh-oh.  Crossing out.  Oh, they're here.  Oh, the Mythbusters are here, too?  They have arrived.  He's on the way.  All right.  We got Jamie and Adam from, of course, Mythbusters.  They're going to join the show next.  We got Scott Rigsby.  Don't forget about him.  He's the double amputee that is the first to complete the Ironman triathlon.  Triathlon.  Didn't someone die doing that, too, recently?  Yeah, over the weekend.  Wow.  And they just did an autopsy, and they don't know why he died. 
[00:44:00]  There's like these monster jellyfish in the Hudson River, and all the athletes were getting  stung.  Were they?  In the swimming portion of the race.  They slamming the Hudson River?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They did a mini triathlon in New York this weekend, and the first time we've had someone  die.  But the good news is the Hudson is clean enough to support jellyfish.  The bad news is they did the triathlon, and all these guys were getting stung.  They said that the jellyfish population is way up.  It could be either global warming or the fact that we all love tuna.  We all love our tuna. 
[00:44:30]  What, do they eat jellyfish?  Oh, yeah.  The tuna love eating jellyfish, but there's not as much as many tunas out there.  So the jellyfish are just exploding, and there's tons of them in the Hudson River.  And these athletes had to just swim through them.  And I guess they were as big as, like, what do they say?  Like, plates.  Yeah.  Do they hurt to get stung by?  These particular ones, yeah.  Yeah, they'll hurt you.  And they're trying to figure out if this athlete got stung, which caused a heart attack.  They don't know why he died, really. 
[00:45:00]  Even after the autopsy, they can't figure it out.  Yep.  Who had swum through the Hudson River?  I didn't realize they did that.  Oh, there were thousands of them this weekend.  Where?  How did I miss it?  I was in New York.  Right outside your building.  Why am I screaming?  Really?  Yeah, literally.  You didn't hear the splashing?  No.  Literally, if you looked down, Jimmy, you would have saw this race that was going on.  Oh, I didn't know.  They ran up the West Side Highway, and they swam right outside your building, basically.  I had no idea.  What was I doing?  I don't know. 
[00:45:30]  You couldn't miss it.  I missed it.  You couldn't miss it.  I was in New York the whole weekend.  I missed it.  They ran up and down the West Side Highway.  They jumped in the water somewhere up in the hundreds, I don't know, somewhere in the  hundreds, and swam down to like 79, 80th Street.  Are those the jellyfish?  Yeah.  E-Rock's showing a picture of the jellyfish.  They're like giant splotches.  You can really see them.  Yeah.  Were they attacking people because people bumped into them, or were they pursuing people?  No, only when you bump into them.  E-Rock, Mike.  They don't chase you.  Oh, okay.  Chase you? 
[00:46:00]  They go like, not even a...  They're like this.  Yeah.  They're like a cloud.  They can't move.  I don't even know how they survive.  What?  The food has to go to them?  How does that work?  They move slowly.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Let's step aside.  We got Mythbusters, those guys coming in, and Philippe Petit.  Nick DiPaolo should be here in a few minutes.  Very, very busy day on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Jimmy and I today.  This is radio at its most fascinating.  Cutting edge radio.  I don't know how to do this. 
[00:46:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  Bang, bang. 
[00:47:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got a busy one.  We got Philippe Petit coming in in about 40 minutes or so.  We got Scott Rigsby, the double amputee, the first double amputee to complete an Ironman  triathlon.  We have to say hi to Nick DiPaolo.  He has entered the studio.  You have to?  It's a chore.  We just have to.  It is a chore. 
[00:47:30]  Nick, just to figure it out.  I made it in here in 36 minutes.  That's a new record, right?  From 36 miles.  Yes.  Two people died in the way.  You'll pay the speed limit, I hope.  I'm kidding, Nick.  I'm kidding.  I can.  Look at me falling for it.  Not too early.  Watch him.  Also on our couch, we got the Mythbusters.  Hi, fellas.  Jamie and Adam.  How are you guys?  Very good.  Good morning.  Now, I'm kind of confused.  You guys are here to promote Shark Week.  We are. 
[00:48:00]  But you're the Mythbusters dudes.  Well, you know, sharks, explosions, guns, it's all dangerous stuff.  It's something.  Are you hosting Shark Week or is Mike still doing that?  No, no, no.  Mike did it last year, I think.  We did it back in 2005 and we're doing it again this year, 2008.  This is called They Couldn't Get Mike to Go Out and Do Promo and these guys happen  to be on the road and they're nice.  They're like, all right, we'll cover it while we're gone.  Yeah, we'll do your promotion for you.  My brother's a marine biologist, so I know everything about sharks.  Oh, awesome.  Is he really?  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  They hate humans.  The only reason they bite is because they get confused and then they let go.  You're talking about brothers?  We're far too bony for them as a meal.  Right.  Yeah, it's not enough fat for the return in energy.  Well, give Oprah a bathing suit.  And he also says there's sharks literally everywhere and if they really weren't the  humans, it would be an all-out war.  Yeah, one of the surprising things when we talk to the biologists is that they would say  things to us like, you want to come up to some conclusion about shark attacks from a 
[00:49:00]  statistical standpoint?  They don't occur.  When you consider the hundreds of millions of people that get into the water every year,  the millions and millions of sharks and the 40 shark attacks, it's a statistical non-number  and it's not worth studying.  Right.  I think we did some research ourselves.  I think more people die from vending machines falling on top of them.  I'm serious.  We did this whole thing once and more people die from a vending machine falling than being  bitten by a shark.  Are you sure about that, Opie? 
[00:49:30]  Yes, I am, Nick.  At least in the ocean it happens that way.  My brother-in-law actually is a surfer in Santa Cruz and he asked me, I actually worked  out the math and emailed him a detailed breakdown that even as a surfer in the water five days  a week, he's far more likely to be struck by lightning anywhere than he is to be bitten  by a shark in the ocean.  I wonder if the statistics occur to somebody, because you're right about this, it's so rare  to have it, but as someone is having their leg ripped off, I wonder if a part of their  brain just goes, how unlucky. 
[00:50:00]  I should have played the lottery.  Yeah, exactly.  Or I should have just brought a soda machine with me or done something stupid, because  this sucks.  You start cursing God.  Why am I the one?  Yeah.  Why?  Because it does happen.  There's great footage.  You guys have shown that footage, right?  Of that woman getting her leg ripped off and then swimming to the boat and all of her  friends are pulling her on the boat.  Oh, that was a myth.  That's not on our show.  No?  No.  What?  You didn't get the...  That was a Three Stooges episode, Jim.  That's exclusive...  Oh, wait.  Oh, that was Orca.  No, you don't remember what the...  That's exclusive video that you guys didn't get a hold of, I guess. 
[00:50:30]  No, you've seen the footage, right?  That is the sickest shark attack ever filmed.  Wait a minute.  I don't remember seeing this myself.  It's a woman, and she gets her whole leg taken off, and now she's swimming to the boat,  and behind her is just a pool of red.  There's a campfire footage.  Yeah.  It's real.  Sure.  There's a leg.  You guys have a heavy day?  Yeah.  She was cranky when she got on the boat.  No, there was...  You guys know the footage I'm talking about, right?  There's a woman in the water, and there's a bunch of people going, oh my God, it's a shark!  And you can see the fin around her, and she goes under, red comes up, and they pull her 
[00:51:00]  in the boat, and you can see where her leg was.  It's like a scene right out of Jaws.  Wait, wait, wait.  Is this fairly new footage?  No, a few years ago.  It's a bit, yeah.  Can I find this on the intranet?  You sure can, Nick.  We're looking for it right now.  I like that.  Anytime a woman gets there.  Yeah, here you go.  This is the one.  Yeah, I mean, that's bad.  We'll get to the Mythbusters, and we're showing a video that people...  Yeah, you might want to use this during Shark Week, guys.  You guys have never seen this?  No.  No.  I haven't either.  I'm getting excited.  There's a woman right now. 
[00:51:30]  You can see her.  She's in the water.  Oh, paddling like a duck.  She's got both legs.  She's screaming.  And you can see the shark.  There's still...  Oh, jeez!  There's a shark.  And the shark grabs her.  The fin out of the water grabs her.  It's March of 94 this happened.  The stupid cameraman.  Hold steady!  Trying to help the dummy.  That's how you know it's real.  It's like he's really panicking, because the camera's all over the place.  He's probably laughing.  And there's water.  And there's the blood as you go back to her.  Let me see that stump.  This was back in 1994, 14 years ago.  Oh, there's Roy Schneider.  This is fake. 
[00:52:00]  This is the worst video ever.  Roy Schneider.  Oh, Scheider.  I'm sorry.  He's dead, too.  You know, the one to keep an eye out for on the internet is the one where this guy's on  a surfboard, and he has a chunk of meat on a line.  He throws the chunk of meat out, the shark takes it, and then he gets up, and he's surfing  away with the shark toe on him.  You kid.  Shark surfing.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that a new sport?  We just came across it, I think, about three weeks after we wrapped shooting Shark Week  in March.  Right. 
[00:52:30]  And we thought, oh, we'll use that next time.  Oh, that's too bad.  That's hilarious, actually.  Do you guys, most people watch this stuff, because there's something about a shark attack,  like that type of footage.  You want to see somebody getting attacked by a shark, and that's the main reason to it.  Well, yeah.  I mean, sharks, it's understandable that people would react this way, because you can't see  them.  You know, there are these big creatures that are really dangerous, and they're under the  water.  You don't know whether they're there or not.  It's like the ultimate sort of a monster kind of a situation for people to fantasize about.  All right. 
[00:53:00]  Can I interrupt you?  Because now we're looking.  You could go to YouTube, or we'll throw it up on onaradio.com.  Oh, jeez.  There's a video of shark surfing.  These guys are insane.  Oh, they're great.  Yeah, I'm not sure that this is real.  I feel like you can see the wake of the towing boat.  But again, it's perfect for the next time we have to do shark myths.  Oh, okay.  So yeah, you guys should try to do this for Mythbusters.  Absolutely.  Do you guys do shark myths?  Yeah, absolutely.  What's wrong about a shark that everybody thinks that's just not true? 
[00:53:30]  Like, will they chase you on land and into the street?  Only in a Warner Brothers cartoon.  Is there one that's not?  What is one that is not?  What is one that's not?  That's completely not true.  What's the real misnomer about shark?  They only have two teeth.  Well, I guess one of them is that they can, that they acquire a taste for humans, which,  you know, all the evidence that we have is just the opposite. 
[00:54:00]  When they, usually these, these bites that occur on people are a mistake.  And then when they chomp down, they realize it's not the regular food and they spit it out.  And that's, that's standard for these cases.  But unfortunately, you got about a thousand teeth going into your flesh.  So that's, that's the problem.  But we did a lovely set of tests.  The last time we hosted Shark Week of some lemon sharks, which are kind of considered the,  the lab rats of sharks because they're, they're so universal and they're very sensitive.  And we exposed them to fish blood and human blood. 
[00:54:30]  And it was really market.  You could do it several times in a row.  Shark would be swimming around the tank.  You'd drop a drop of fish blood.  And the moment the sharks got near the fish blood, it would start turning its head around,  looking for where the food source was.  He did the same thing with human blood.  He swam right through it, didn't even notice.  Well, the funny one that we did actually was a, a story about sharks being repelled by chilies.  These native Indians had, you know, trailed them behind their boats to protect them.  The fish, these were fishermen.  It's perhaps the oldest shark repellent there is. 
[00:55:00]  Is it true?  And yeah, we, we got in the water with the, well, I, we can't tell you whether it's true or not.  We tested it on the show, but we, we ground up like a, you know, five pounds of habanero chilies.  Jamie takes his, Jamie, Jamie's like, well, let me try it.  And he dips his pinky in and he goes like this, the tiny spit on his tongue.  And then his whole head turns red.  Yeah.  And so we had these balloons of these things that we were making sharks bite, dangling them right next to fit or, you know, bait fish. 
[00:55:30]  And they, you know, they were exhaling it through their gills.  They were just, you know, swimming through clouds of these habanero chilies.  Well, I've never seen one in a Mexican restaurant, so I'm guessing.  Yeah, I wouldn't take that chance.  Did you guys jump in the water with the sharks?  Oh, yeah.  Or shark week?  Every single day.  Every single day.  It was like, we were really, yeah, we were like chumming up the waters behind the boat.  Actually, I did a lot of the diving in this one.  So Jamie's back there gleefully chumming up the water.  The water's boiling with lemon sharks.  And then in order for me to get down to the cage to the cameraman and the shark divers, 
[00:56:00]  I've got to jump off the dive platform into the middle of like 26 to 8 foot long lemon sharks.  Nice.  No, was it lemon sharks?  Yeah, they were lemon sharks.  There were some tiger sharks in the area.  And actually, somebody had gotten killed by one of the tiger sharks in that area just a couple weeks before that.  So yeah, we were swimming with the tiger shark that already had the taste.  Are you doing anything with, let me ask, the nurse shark.  We all, our greatest terror is the nurse shark. 
[00:56:30]  Is it retarded?  Is that a retarded shark?  No one respects the nurse shark.  Actually, you should.  What the hell is a nurse shark?  It's just a big, dumb thing.  It looks scary, but it does nothing.  It barely moves.  It just hangs out at the bottom of the water.  Well, see, actually, that's a good question because a lot of people think that.  And so as a result of that, nurse sharks are one of the more dangerous ones to be around,  or at least statistically, more people have been bitten by nurse sharks.  Well, here's the problem with them is their jaws, they have ratcheting jaws. 
[00:57:00]  They don't have very large teeth, but if they grab your finger, their jaws ratchet.  You lose your finger.  Even if you kill that shark, you're not getting your finger back out of those jaws.  I would make that trade, though.  Take my finger, just let me live.  They have really powerful jaws, and it's a flat palate, and they can actually just mash whatever they get in their mouth.  You'll lose it.  Why nurse shark?  Where's the name? 
[00:57:30]  You know, I don't know.  Does it wear a little white hat?  No, no, no.  Does it dispense medicine?  What is that?  No.  Don't they swim close to the bottom?  They're big, dumb, lumbering sharks.  They don't look like great whites.  They don't look frightening.  They swim across, they're called a benthic feeder.  They feed across the bottom on microorganisms, mostly.  They hang out in lobbies of hospitals.  They eat shellfish, actually.  Oh, okay, shellfish.  There you go.  That's why that's right.  So they're not Jewish.  Why don't Jews eat shellfish?  No.  You didn't know that?  I never know.  Where are you from?  I have a lot of Jewish friends. 
[00:58:00]  Don't get me wrong.  Rich Voss is your favorite friend, for Christ's sake.  I didn't know that until just now, too.  Well, he has tattoos, and he smokes, and he thinks Christ was the Messiah.  He's not a good Jew.  No, he's not.  I had no idea that they don't eat shellfish Jewish people.  No clue.  Yes.  All right.  That's it.  All right.  Let's say hi to Coke Logic, a regular to the Open Anthony show.  Coke Logic, what's up?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, Bernie.  It looks good.  Janet, I'm screwing that up.  What?  Amy.  Are you nervous?  Yeah, I'm a little nervous.  Stupid.  You're falling apart.  Mythbusters.  Okay. 
[00:58:30]  Okay.  You guys had a special where you did the, you blew out a candle with using a subwoofer.  Yeah.  And I just want to know, you guys didn't put a screen up on the subwoofer, so I want to  know, was there air pushing out?  Is Nick laughing at me?  Yes.  Yeah, he is.  Jesus Christ, is this nerdy?  Go ahead.  We're all listening to you, and we feel a silent revulsion.  He's like, is Nick laughing at me?  Yeah, he is.  Go ahead, Coke. 
[00:59:00]  Smoke is the laugh, I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Coke.  Okay, so the candle blew out by the subwoofer, but you guys didn't put like a pop filter  or a screen in between the candle and the subwoofer, so I was wondering if it's like popping  your piece, but is that what blew out the candle?  Well, yeah.  Like confirmed.  The air that is moving off the cone of the speaker is what put out the candle, yes.  It's not just sound waves by themselves.  I mean, and for that matter, if you didn't have the air there, there is no sound in a vacuum. 
[00:59:30]  So, I mean, if we put a shield up in front of it, nothing would have happened.  The airwaves is, yeah, the air moving is what is creating the sound.  So, okay, hold on.  Coke logic, an excellent question.  Did air blow the candle out?  Or was it a suicide?  Well, the experiment was to see if sound alone.  I have a question for you guys.  Where are you calling from, Radio Shack?  Before your question, I got an observation.  I think you guys are running out of stuff to do if it's coming down to speakers blowing 
[01:00:00]  out candles.  No.  I mean, the beauty of the show is that we'll take on things like that, as well as, you  know, we're still doing it.  Next week, we're going back and we got about a thousand pounds of thermite that we're going  to make an SUV disappear with.  Oh, we're also doing Slipping on a Banana Peel.  And we spent all last week, well, the special effects industry, working on a model that you  don't, the art director is a bad art director and you don't think the model is that good  looking and call it turd polishing. 
[01:00:30]  Okay.  So, we spent, last week and we're spending part of next week finding out if it is possible  actually to polish a turd.  Like I said, running out of things to do.  Why don't you tie some rot around Keith Olbermann's neck and see what happens.  Put him in a tub of nerve sharks.  Hey, do you guys do something with the Kennedy assassination with the, did you guys hook up  stuff with that?  Kennedy get assassin?  I was just shocked myself.  What happened?  Recently.  In Dallas.  Did you do anything with the trajectory and stuff like that?  No, we have not done anything to do with the magic bullet. 
[01:01:00]  We did, one of our earliest episodes was about whether or not an ice bullet was used and  we busted that twice.  But no, we haven't gone near any of the other...  Did people really, I'm sorry to interrupt you, did people really thought of an ice bullet?  They really did.  That was really one of the prevailing theories.  What's that?  I don't know.  It doesn't exist.  You can't shoot a bullet.  It was, the idea is that an explanation for the magic bullet was that an ice bullet was  used that created the wound and that's why they found this one perfect bullet.  And we proved that it's ballistically improbable, if not impossible, to successfully shoot someone 
[01:01:30]  with a bullet made of ice because it's going to vaporize long before it gets to them.  And if you're going to shoot somebody with something, it's not subtle.  You might as well use a real bullet.  There's plenty of other ways to hide your evidence.  Yeah, and who wants to hide a bullet by using ice?  If you're shooting at the president, who's going to say, let's take a shot with the ice  thing I thought of?  Didn't kill him, he just got an ice cream headache.  Like, are you guys doing anything with alternative fuel and all that?  Like, figuring out other ways to, you know, run your car?  Actually, yeah, that's become kind of a personal thing for me as far as, I mean, we mess around 
[01:02:00]  with these technologies all the time.  We've done things with, you know, fuel mileage, gas savers and all this kind of stuff.  And 90% of it is just...  99%.  99% is nonsense.  It's nonsense.  But there is some pretty good stuff out there.  There was one that we have done already, which was...  What did we call that about driving angry?  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:02:30]  You know, with all the fuel efficiency stuff we've done, whether or not these various things  work, and even tailgate up or down only improves your mileage by maybe 2%.  It's like 10 miles over a full tank of gas.  But we actually just did...  It's going to air in a few weeks.  The other team did driving angry versus driving relaxed.  And you won't believe...  How do you get the guy angry?  The difference.  That's the funny part to watch.  Okay.  That's the very funny...  How they got Tori and Grant angry is fantastic. 
[01:03:00]  Please tell me that angry driving...  I know you can't give it a little, but I'm really hoping that angry driving...  Saves.  ...saves gas.  Please.  Yeah.  Please.  How great...  You're going to see me coming in here this morning.  Especially if they could break it down, like honking incessantly saves you this much,  ethnic thirst, slurs...  Yeah, slurs.  Yeah, yeah.  I'd be getting 65 miles to the gallon.  Let's go to Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Jim.  Morning.  Morning.  Hi.  Guys, you know, I just wanted to mention... 
[01:03:30]  What's it like working with Carrie, man?  She's a little hot one, huh?  Well, yeah, she's cute.  What can we say?  Carrie's great.  She's one of the nicest people we know.  We heard you both slept with her.  Is that a myth?  That would be a myth.  At the same time, in a shark tank.  Right.  Let's go to Kenny.  Kenny, what's up, buddy?  Just wanted to call and say I love the show.  Which one?  I love the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:04:00]  I love the Mythbusters.  Okay.  And Shark Week, yeah.  You know, put that girl on the show.  Quite sexy.  This was a terrific phone call.  Thank you, Kenny.  Yeah.  He just kind of gave like a breakdown of what he thought of everything.  You guys okay?  Shark Week?  Eh, the girl's sexy.  I'm going to go tell myself.  The weather's okay.  Yeah.  Danny's a huge fan of Mythbusters.  Danny, you got a question for the guys?  He's seen every single episode.  Yeah, I probably have.  You know, it's funny because like working on this show, a lot of celebrities come in and out.  You know, Gene Simmons was in just, you know, a few weeks ago. 
[01:04:30]  The big, huge people have sat on this couch and the Mythbusters are here and I'm actually  like, I'm just, I'm frozen.  I can't think of anything to say.  Well, the way you started out was good though.  Like normally we get big celebrities.  No, I know.  Yeah, exactly.  I just put my foot in my mouth.  You can come over here, sit right here on the couch if you'd like.  No, that's right.  Are you there?  Yeah, there'll be another Mythbusters.  I'm extremely, these guys are, I mean, you know, for lack of a better word, they're kind  of like my idols.  Is that right?  Yeah, just from the science and the engineering standpoint, I mean, it's brilliant stuff.  Why, did you go to school for engineer?  No, I dropped out of high school. 
[01:05:00]  That's why I look up to these guys.  Like a vaudeville set up.  Exactly.  It's like, wow, look how smart they are.  His idol is anyone with a diploma.  We got at least three or four guys on staff that never graduated high school, so.  It doesn't show.  How's things going in Buffalo?  You got two guys on the air that never have.  I didn't, Anthony didn't, he didn't.  A bunch of dopes.  You got to have a question for Mythbusters.  Yeah, you love these guys.  Which one was on the Charmin commercial?  That was me. 
[01:05:30]  All right, thought I recognized.  I squeezed the Charmin.  What's your favorite, what was your favorite episode?  Yeah, there you go.  Well, no, I think my question for the Mythbusters would be, what is the myth that is probably  most contested?  I know you guys do your recaps of, you know, myths that have gone one way and then the viewers  contest the outcome and then you guys will redo it.  But which myth out of all of the myths was one that was contested the most?  Probably the most vitriolic response to...  Remember, I dropped out of high school. 
[01:06:00]  I don't know what that is.  But the angriest response we ever got was for doing one called Sniper Scope, which in  Vietnam, this famous sniper named Carlos Hathcock, I swear, supposedly shot another sniper who  was aiming at him by shooting through his scope and into his eye and killing him.  Yeah, it was just like a saving private ride.  And we did it, we, unfortunately, we had bad information, we did it with the wrong scope 
[01:06:30]  and the wrong ammunition, and we busted the myth, and I'll tell you, you just, you don't  want to piss off, I don't want to piss off snipers.  I think it's bad policy.  What did you use?  What was wrong about what you used?  Did you use a cannonball?  A water gun?  No, no, no, we just, we used ammunition that was close, but the scope, it turned out, the  scope that he was, that his enemy was using was very different than the one we were, it's  not like a modern scope at all, it's much smaller, has a different reticule and different  lensing and everything, and once we actually went back and got the correct scope, and we 
[01:07:00]  actually managed to find a ballistic expert who found us a box of ammunition from that  year that he, like the identical stuff, then we were able to shoot through the scope and  we were able to confirm that the myth actually happened.  Yeah, but the shot required, I made the shot finally, and it was all like at point-blank  range, but the shot required that you put that bullet within, like, I don't know, a hundredth  of an inch or less of accuracy, there was no, if you were off to the side by a hair, it 
[01:07:30]  was going to hit some of these other metal parts in the lens, or in the scope, and it wouldn't  start.  How far were they supposed to be?  Well, I think they were supposed to be at least 200 yards, it's an unbelievable, and  I'll tell you, the other thing is, when the email comes in, it's really angry, and then  it has the, you know, I'm a sergeant, I'm in the military, I'm in the Navy, I've been  teaching, I've been teaching sharpshooting for 30 years, it was, the email was not only  scary, but really well backed up.  It's amazing, it's really amazing the stuff that they actually let you get away with, like 
[01:08:00]  sometimes I'll watch a new episode, and it's like, I can't believe who's letting them do  that.  Well, you know, just where, like, you know, where I remember one shooting fish in a barrel,  and you have Jamie firing a shotgun into a barrel full of, like, there's an insurance  company that has to underwrite that, so I mean, I can only imagine what they've said  no to.  A barrel of what, Danny Fish?  Yeah.  Okay.  So, I mean, what are some of the things that, like, the insurance company has to know,  you just can't do that?  One of the things we learned is that we can't call, we were going to do one about awning 
[01:08:30]  fall, you've seen Jackie Chan fall through a set of awnings, and we wanted to do that,  and we proved that, we actually came up with some interesting results on that, but then  we wanted to show how Hollywood stuntmen would do it.  So we were going to set me up on a descender rig and do it, except that we had called what  we were going to do a stunt, and to the insurance company, the word stunt has a very specific,  it's a term of art that means an acceptable amount of risk, and for them, with me and Jamie 
[01:09:00]  as the assets we are, they were like, you can't do the stunt, you're not allowed, and  Discovery said, well, that's fine, is it a little more insurance, we'd pay a little more  of a premium.  They said, no, no, no, there's nothing you can pay, we will not let them do the stunt.  But Tori can do it.  They let Tori do it.  He's expendable, no, it's one of their build crew.  Well, we always figure out a way of doing it, I mean, we're no different than a couple  of your average 14-year-old pyromaniacs, but the difference is that we call the police  and the fire department before we set something on fire. 
[01:09:30]  It's just funny that they wouldn't let you do something like that, like rigging and harnesses,  but I remember there was a myth to test whether or not you could use a 9mm bullet, a 22 caliber  bullet, as a replacement car fuse.  Right, right, right.  And that was fine.  You could plug a fuse into a, excuse me, a bullet into a car fuse, and they're hiding behind  like, you know, what amounts to plexiglass, and the bullets are just firing indoors, mind  you, it's not outside of a range or anything.  And, you know, it's just amazing what some of the stuff that you let you do.  That was one of those urban myths, right? 
[01:10:00]  Some guy did that, and he killed him.  Yeah, and it shot him in the groin.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  One of the things we found out is that we will describe a setup and send diagrams to the  insurance company, and we will say, well, we're going to set this up, and we're going  to heat it up, and it's probably going to be under pressure, and if it blows up, we'll  be behind the blast chamber.  And they'll say, what, if it blows up?  No, no, no, no, no, it can't blow up.  And then we realize that if we say, when it blows up, we'll be safe behind the blast chamber,  and they're like, okay.  Yeah.  They don't like if, they like when. 
[01:10:30]  They like it if we tell them exactly what it is.  Take it on the guesswork.  Tell them to expect the worst.  We do experiments on the Opie and Anthony show.  We're just like you guys.  Our experiments are a little different.  We did foaming.  Yeah, we took the Diet Coke and Mentos thing.  Oh, yeah.  And we just took it to the next level.  How do you say this?  We did foaming.  Danny?  A private fountain.  Yeah.  Like a private dancer?  A private fountain.  A private part fountain.  Think female.  Think foaming blank. 
[01:11:00]  Think and it wasn't as impressive as we were hoping.  It was an homage.  Yeah.  I'd like to say.  It wasn't as impressive.  Nothing was hitting the ceiling or anything.  It was just kind of.  I have an idea for that.  We're going to rework it.  Oh, we're going to rework it.  Very, very soon.  Maybe we can get some advice from these guys.  How can we rework the foaming blank?  Are you referring to an enema, perhaps?  Or is it?  No.  You should try that.  The front side?  No.  We're trying to keep it sexy.  Actually, you know what?  There's actually a news story, kind of relevant.  Stumbering was telling me about it.  There was an apartment. 
[01:11:30]  There was a guy spraying for bugs.  I think it was in the city.  It was in Manhattan, right?  It was in Jersey.  And he ended up blowing up his entire apartment because he had sprayed too much bug spray.  Yep.  We did that on the show.  Yeah, and I do remember you guys doing that on the show.  I just thought it was so funny.  Obviously, the guy wasn't a fan of the show.  Yeah, he would have never attempted that.  It's amazing, though.  Wait, how did the whole apartment blow up?  Was there a candle lit or something?  Lighting farts next month.  He had a gas stove, and once the initial explosion happened, apparently there was a reaction,  and boom, big fire.  Well, what's the initial explosion?  I don't get it. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, what triggered the spark?  It's a pilot light.  He filled his apartment with bug spray, and the pilot light lit it, and then the apartment  caught fire.  All right.  Remember that if you want to get rid of your wife.  Have you guys ever done the drop a penny off the Empire State Building?  Will it crack your head?  Yes.  Yeah, they did that one.  I missed it, so did it?  No.  Well, first of all, the observation deck of the Empire State Building is 300 feet back  from the outer extents of the base of the building, so you have to be able to throw a  penny a football field.  Second of all, we figured out the terminal velocity of a penny is only about 70 or 80 miles 
[01:12:30]  an hour at the worst, so Jamie actually built a staple gun that fired a penny at that speed.  You should have seen this thing.  It was ridiculous.  That's cool.  I saw that one.  So what happened?  What happened?  Well, he shot me in the ass, and I'm still here.  What kind of damage did it do to your butt?  It's like getting hit with a pellet gun.  It wasn't that bad.  But then we wanted to figure out, is there any speed at which a penny could be lethal?  So I built a slide for a penny that bolted to the end of a rifle with a blank round in 
[01:13:00]  it, and we got that going, I think, like Mach 4, 2,500 miles per hour, and we fired  it into a skull, a real human skull encased in ballistics gelatin, and it still wasn't powerful  enough to break the bone.  I mean, you'd be really upset, but the penny just doesn't have enough mats.  Especially because of the wind.  Is that what you also accounted to for wind resistance as it was falling?  Well, what happens is it tumbles.  It's not like a bullet or an arrow that's aerodynamic.  So that tumbling causes turbulence. 
[01:13:30]  It slows it down.  We did another experiment, we should tell these guys.  We did?  Yeah, the bottle rocket thing.  Oh.  You guys should do the bottle rocket thing.  Well, I wasn't around.  That was before my quote-unquote time.  Well, we built a heat shield and everything.  This was right out of Mythbusters.  I remember listening to it.  It was, we fired a bottle rocket from a girl's stuff.  I'm noticing a theme.  Really?  I'm noticing a theme.  But it worked.  We were pretty impressed with that one.  You know, what was I going to say? 
[01:14:00]  Are you feeling more comfortable with the myth?  Yeah, I am.  Danny's fast-forwarding.  We're going to be doing lunch and drinks together a few hours from right now.  In the movie Fight Club, there's a scene where the main character's pilot light gets blown  out in his kitchen.  Yeah.  And the whole apartment fills with gas.  Yeah.  And then the compressor from the fridge is supposed to spark and ignite the gas.  Yeah.  I don't recall if you guys have ever done something similar to that, but...  When we did the bug bomb episode, we actually experimented with four or five ways in which 
[01:14:30]  a spark can be generated in your house.  There's a motor starting.  There's a pilot light.  There's light switches with weak contacts.  And absolutely all of those will totally work to ignite a properly mixed gas...  Right.  You still need to have that, right?  The air-to-gas ratio?  Yes.  Stoichiometry.  I have a question about the bug bomb.  Was it actually regular bug spray, or was it those bombs that go off?  Yeah, it's the bombs that you set and you leave your...  No, no, no.  It's the bombs you set and leave your house, and the thing is, it'll say, you know, only 
[01:15:00]  use one of these at a time, and people who have a bug problem will buy ten.  We found so many cases of this happening.  I mean, at least, I think, four or five cases of people destroying their apartment or destroying  the entire building by setting off ten of these bombs and then leaving the house in  a pilot light or something, kicking off and blowing up the whole house.  Because they want to just get everything in one shot.  Yeah.  Washington Heights.  Well, we've got to get the big plug in.  We've got to take a break here, but it's Mythbusters, Shark Week. 
[01:15:30]  Anything else you'd give away as far as the new season goes?  Yeah, well, actually, as soon as Shark Week airs, we've got 11 new episodes.  When does it air, by the way?  I don't have that in front of me.  Shark Week airs Sunday at 9?  No, I mean the special Shark Week on Discovery.  I believe it's Sunday at 9.  Sunday at 9, okay.  And then starting Wednesday, we have 11 brand new episodes airing all in a row.  They've been saving them up since we did the Alaska special back in March.  Nice.  Very good.  You guys also have a book out.  Is this an older book or is this new?  Which one? 
[01:16:00]  The Mythbusters, the explosive truth behind 30 of the most perplexing urban legends of  all time.  That one's a couple years old.  Okay, it's on the prep sheet like it's coming out tomorrow.  So, just one last question for the Mythbusters.  Still a good read.  With the new season coming up, I did hear, I don't know if it's fact, but I heard that  one of the new episodes is going to revolve around the moon missions and whether NASA  actually made it to the moon.  Absolutely.  We take on the myth that the NASA moon landing was a hoax and we had a lot of fun.  That was awesome.  Oh, that's good.  I can't wait for that one. 
[01:16:30]  We have Buzz Aldrin coming at the end of the month, too.  Is this going to air soon?  It is.  It's actually one of the very first episodes that airs in the new season.  All right, let's check it out before it gets here.  Yeah, he really gets testy.  We're hoping he kicks us in the groin or something.  That's our goal with that interview.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Guys, thank you.  It's always a pleasure.  Jamie and Adam from Mythbusters, thanks.  Shark Week starting Sunday, right?  Sunday at 9.  All right.  Up next, Scott Rigsby, the double amputee that is the first to finish an Ironman triathlon.  Stay there. 
[01:17:00]  You got that right.  We've got a real busy show today.  I want to thank the Mythbusters guys for coming in today.  We've got Philippe Petit coming in in about 15, 20 minutes.  We've got Nick Tappala sitting in with us today.  Hey, Nick, you promoting anything?  Yes, I am.  I am.  Ah!  Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor this Saturday night.  And then next following weekend, comics.  August 1st and 2nd in New York City.  Very good.  That's the, you know.  You're not doing our thing? 
[01:17:30]  When?  No, I had this comics thing lined up.  I thought you were on a thing.  We've been promoting that you, oh my God.  No, my agent was called, right?  He called you guys, all right?  He called Peterson.  He's finished.  Well, we found out, I think, yesterday.  Or I did.  You're kidding.  No, I'm not even kidding.  Since we announced it.  We've been announcing it as part of the lineup for weeks.  I told him this over two weeks ago.  And he's like, yeah, we took care of it.  We talked to the show.  No.  No, he didn't. 
[01:18:00]  No.  Where's Kenny?  Kenny!  All right, that's, all right.  Club started Kenny.  So Nick's not going to be part of the virus show this summer.  No, I'm at comics.  What do you got, Kenny?  When did you find out that Nick wasn't doing the show?  Two weeks ago.  But allegedly, Live Nation got involved and was trying to figure something out.  And allegedly, there was a mix-up by superartist.com, Nick's rep.  Well, that sucks, Nick.  We wanted you this year. 
[01:18:30]  There's going to be a big crowd out there for you.  Big crowd.  I know.  I heard.  It's like a four-hour show, too, right?  Yeah, it goes on all night long.  I'll make one of them, I'm sure.  All right.  Nick DePaul sitting in today.  877-212-ON-A.  Let me take care of something really fast, and we're going to move on to Scott, who's  sitting on our couch.  Allie in Buffalo, New York, the home of Shred and Reagan.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  All right, Allie.  I was just calling because I woke up this morning.  My eyes aren't even open, and my boyfriend's telling me that you guys are off the air this 
[01:19:00]  week in Buffalo.  Well, yeah.  We made a deal with Citadel Broadcasting.  They wanted us to, like, let them off the hook for Syracuse, and they said that we would  stay on in Buffalo until at least January.  Oh, God.  You're breaking my heart.  We kind of made that deal.  We weren't happy.  Well, it wasn't even a deal.  We didn't have a choice.  They were basically telling us that's what they were going to do, and then they kind of  made it look like we had a choice in this whole thing. 
[01:19:30]  So last week, we had a lot of angry phone calls from Syracuse.  They're still calling, by the way.  We could put Syracuse calls on today as well.  Everyone really upset that we're not on the air in Syracuse anymore.  So then we were sort of dealing with that, and then I got a call from my agent yesterday,  and he said, you're not going to believe this, but now you're going to go back on Syracuse,  which we're not on today, and they're taking us off Buffalo ASAP.  So this could be our last day, Allie.  So does this mean that I have to listen to stupid Shut Up and Rock in the morning? 
[01:20:00]  I don't know what they're going to do.  They don't have a plan.  Man, it's a financial thing because we're doing very well in Buffalo, and for the amount  of money they are paying for this radio show, trust me, it's a huge bargain, and for some  reason, they can't even afford that.  It's just ridiculous.  We love the Buffalo market, too, so we're really, really frustrated.  We lose some of these markets.  We're like, ah, who cares?  We've never been there.  We don't know the people.  Whatever.  But Buffalo, you know, we have a long relationship with Buffalo.  Well, we knew something was fishy when y'all lost Philly. 
[01:20:30]  That just didn't seem right.  No, well, they're going to do the right thing with Philly sooner than later, so whatever.  I mean, luckily, we still have XM and all, but it's not the same.  No, we're not happy.  I don't know what you could do.  I know the PD up there, he was left out of the loop.  He said it came from way, way above him, and he's like, what could we do?  I'm like, I don't know.  I'm going to get on the phone with some people today because I think it's complete, you know,  bull crap.  Yeah.  Watch your mouth, Opie. 
[01:21:00]  All right.  Yeah.  And I'm hearing rumors they're just going to play music and maybe move Stren and Reagan  back.  I don't know.  It's a cluster F.  It's unbelievable.  Well, we're going to miss you, and I got to head to work, so I'm punching out, but damn,  this sucks.  Thank you, miss.  Yeah, take an acting lesson.  Yeah.  Damn, this sucks.  Thanks, Alex.  It does suck.  All right, guys, take it easy.  All right.  Our next guest.  Insult your biggest fan.  F. Allie.  F. everybody.  No, I think I see the problem. 
[01:21:30]  This business is so stupid.  I wanted to get back into it.  It's the only thing that excites me is radio, and it turns out it looks like Marconi was  making more money.  You're better off doing a podcast at this point, Nick.  I know how to do that.  It's a very unstable business right now.  Hey, in studio, we got Scott Rigsby, right?  Yep.  Okay, I'm praying I've been saying your name right the last week or so.  This is a little strange.  I was in Central Park.  I just jumped on my bike.  I was going to do a loop, and I'm biking along, and all of a sudden, I see Scott with  prosthetic legs standing there in the middle of Central Park in the road where we all bike, 
[01:22:00]  and he's got a camera crew.  I'm like, I got to stop and talk to this guy.  And then, what?  We talked for about a half hour or so.  Yeah, sure.  And his story was completely fascinating.  It turns out that Scott is the first double amputee to ever complete an Ironman triathlon.  Actually, I'm the first double amputee to ever complete the Hawaiian Ironman.  It's the Ironman World Championships.  There was a guy earlier from Japan, 22-year-old guy, that actually finished Ironman New Zealand. 
[01:22:30]  But then, the Hawaiian Ironman is the oldest one, and it's actually the elite athletes of  all these 22 Ironman competitions around the world.  It's the best athletes, and they meet in Hawaii every year in October.  So, someone was before you?  Yeah, there was.  All right, beat it.  There was a young guy.  The New Zealand one, though.  Japanese don't count.  The New Zealand one's easy.  Anyone could do that.  No one wants to hear the guy that did it second. 
[01:23:00]  I was looking at your thing, and it said that you lost your legs when you were 18.  Yeah.  And the way you lost them was very, very...  Terrific.  I mean, there's never a good way to lose them, but this was particularly...  I wasn't sure if you were a soldier.  You wanted to say what happened?  No, actually, I was 18 years old.  I'm from southwest Georgia, and I was working a landscaping job, and we were pulling a flatbed  trailer.  I was sitting on the back of a pickup truck, and this 18-wheeler tried to pass us in a no-passings 
[01:23:30]  on.  We were approaching a bridge, and he didn't think he was going to have enough room for  both vehicles being on the bridge, so he moved over.  I got knocked off.  I grabbed a hold of the side of the truck for a brief second.  We were going like 45 miles an hour, and my legs got lodged in between our flatbed trailer  tire, and I literally bounced up and down the road over 324 feet on the pavement.  My friend in the middle that was sitting on the back of this toolbox with me grabbed my 
[01:24:00]  other friend, or he would have been crushed between the side of the truck and the bridge,  and then he went to grab me, and I wasn't there, so he started beating on the back of  the glass, and then that's when the truck actually stopped.  Do you remember it at all, or is it just what people have told you, or do you remember  that moment?  I remember the collision, and right before the tractor-trailer collided with us, I remember,  gosh, I can't believe this guy's going to pass on our bridge, and then the next thing  I know, I'm holding on for dear life for just a second, and then the next thing I know, 
[01:24:30]  I wake up, and my buddy, I'm trying to get up.  I played high school football, and so I just got my bell rung, and so I'm trying to get  up, and he pushes me down.  We've been in an accident, and help is on the way.  Oh, so you actually were there in shock, obviously, and when did you realize that you had lost  both legs?  Did they tell you there, or in the hospital?  Well, I mean, it was probably, I think it was literally probably three days later, I  had a concussion, so I woke up like three days, well, later on that night, I take that  back, later on that night, I woke up probably one o'clock, and I heard this doctor talking 
[01:25:00]  with my parents, and he said something about taking off both of my legs, and I sat up, and  I said, you mean to tell me you're going to take off both of my legs?  I'm an athlete, and you know, this was a manual labor job, earning a little extra money for  college, I was in phenomenal shape, and I only had one scar on my body, so to go from  an 18-year-old kid who has one little scar on his body to some doctor telling me, hey, 
[01:25:30]  we're going to take off both of your legs below the knee, I was, you know, I didn't even know  what to think, and then I passed out, and three days later, I woke up, and I was missing  my right leg below the knee.  And they just, it was just so mangled, there was nothing they could do?  Well, I mean, mostly, part of it wasn't even there, it was drug off, right above my ankle,  and then my left leg, my calcaneus, the heel bone, was completely knocked off, and so they  shipped me from southwest Georgia to Atlanta, and they took some bone chips from my back, 
[01:26:00]  some muscle from underneath my arm, and some skin from my thigh, and actually created me  an ankle, had eight surgeries in six weeks, 17 in a year, and this was July 23rd, 1986,  when the accident happened, so the course of a year, I had 17 surgeries, and then I went  off to college at the University of Georgia, and the course of probably seven years, I had  additional surgeries, 12 years, I had 25 surgeries.  So what you had, this is now, you had the right leg was gone, you were using crutches or a 
[01:26:30]  prosthetic?  No, no, I was using a prosthetic, so I went off to college after a year, but I was having,  really, my college years, over the course of seven years, really consisted of getting a surgery,  going to class, getting a surgery, going to class, and so I graduated, and then worked odd jobs along  the way, but really, over the course of 12 years, I had 25 surgeries, and then I went to my,  went to a surgeon there in Atlanta, he's the, Dr. Scott Gologley, he's the team physician for the  Atlanta Falcons and Thrashers, and said, hey, you know, I want you to take off the other 
[01:27:00]  leg, and so literally, he, June 22nd, 1998, he took off my left leg below, four or five  inches below the knee, and six weeks later, from the time that I had surgery, I was running  foot over foot, just like if he saw me in the, in the park.  Absolutely amazing, by the way, go ahead.  I'm sorry, 13 years after the accident, or 12 years after the accident?  12 years after the accident, yeah.  You had the other leg removed, what, was it just, was it so irritating, or was it like  you couldn't do anything with it, or why would you have had that, was it just? 
[01:27:30]  It really, I mean, I, I, I had never run, I was never able to run farther than just a  mile, and then, I mean, I would run, be trying to run in college, or out of college, and, and  I would run, and I would, because half of my foot was kind of manufactured via skin  graft, muscle grafts, I, it would bleed, I would open up my shoe, I'd take my shoe off,  and there'd just be blood in there, but I didn't feel it, and so I, I really felt like 
[01:28:00]  I was going to run the risk of infection, and plus, over the course of 12 years, $2 million  worth of medical expenses, 25 surgeries, I felt like I was a professional patient, I felt  like I was a, a prisoner trapped to this leg, there was this life that was out there that  I needed to be leading, but I couldn't do it unless I took off this other leg, and,  like I said.  That's got to be a hell of a decision.  That was your own decision, that wasn't a doctor's, nobody recommended that, or?  Well, I mean, obviously, I had to go, I mean, when I went to the doctor, prosthetics, you 
[01:28:30]  know, you had to think about how prosthetics have advanced.  Right, since then.  You know, here in 1980, I mean, in 1986, would you ever have thought that a double amputee sprinter  would have compete, would have been banned from, from the Olympics, or try to compete  in the Olympics.  Right.  And the interesting thing is, is nowadays, prosthetics are, are advanced, there's not a  technical advantage, but not, that's not to say that that won't happen in the future.  Right.  But, as it stands today, there's not a technical advantage. 
[01:29:00]  The, but, but back then, I mean, I was probably wearing legs that weighed, you know, 10 or 15  pounds each, and.  Combersome, not really getting around that well.  Made out of fiberglass, but material.  Right.  And now, they're made out of space shuttle material.  What exactly, because looking at you, I mean, we've seen that people with prosthetics walking,  and it's obviously, it looks comfortable and, and, and natural.  What holds, because the leg, it starts off, you know, the sneakers and then the prosthetic,  and then it kind of goes into a bandage, which comes up on the thigh.  What holds the leg on and keeps it from coming off? 
[01:29:30]  Basically, there, you know, there, there's only like four parts to a prosthesis.  There's a, just like you put on your socks when you get up in the morning.  I put on a, kind of a sheet that's made out of urethane.  It's just as a, as, as a gel liner, and that's called a prosthetic liner.  Slide it over my legs.  My legs are off four or five inches below each knee.  Just slide it, slide it over my leg.  And then that acts as an interface between my leg and then a carbon fiber custom socket. 
[01:30:00]  Just imagine kind of a mold, almost like a denture for my, my leg.  And then that, that gel liner sits into the prosthetic socket.  And then a sleeve, this, a sleeve, you know, just like you have a athletic sleeve.  Well, I have a, kind of a silicone sleeve that slides over my leg and it creates an airtight  seal.  And then right below the prosthetic socket is a small little tube that's a one-way valve  and it pushes the air out.  So my legs are held on by vacuum. 
[01:30:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  And then there's the, the last part of the prosthesis is just really the foot portion  of the, um, the, of the prosthetic.  Now, when Scott walked in this morning, if you didn't know any better, you would say this  guy has both his legs.  Yeah.  I mean, you look down and it's obvious, but you walked in and I can't see before your  waist.  And I'm like, it looks like he doesn't.  The movement is, it's amazing.  I mean, last night, I mean, uh, well, I mean, I worked for two things.  I worked, uh, for six months, I was in the, uh, internet field in sales and, uh, I, uh, 
[01:31:00]  was working with one of my coworkers and I said, Hey, I need to go get my, uh, I've  got an appointment with my, uh, to get my legs fixed.  And she's like, what are you talking about?  I was like, well, I have two artificial legs and she never knew she worked with me for six  months.  So most people don't know if I have, if I, uh, you know, have pants on.  And even if I have pants on, uh, like this homeless guy, um, hit on me last night.  He's, Hey man, can you give me some money?  And I'm like, you just asked a guy with no legs for money.  And he looked down and he's like, Oh, sorry. 
[01:31:30]  I didn't, I didn't know.  I didn't even know he was looking at my face.  He wasn't looking at my legs.  Right.  How many years since this is, so what, how old are you now?  You're in your thirties?  Uh, no, I actually got four, four, turned 40 back in May.  So over half your life with, uh, yeah, yeah.  22 years.  Yeah.  Are you like, uh, I mean, we always personalize it.  How would I feel?  Do you feel like kind of pissed off that it happened or are you more grateful?  Like I probably should have been killed and I'm lucky to be here at all.  No, I mean that really, I, a lot of the biggest questions I speak to kids groups, uh, across  the nation.  And the biggest question that I get is if you had a choice for, you know, God to give 
[01:32:00]  you, give you back your leg, real legs or have prosthetics continue with prosthetics for the  rest of your life, which would you choose?  And I said, hands down, I would choose my prosthetics because at the end of my life, I  want, you know, it's all about what did I do here?  You know, what kind of difference did I make here?  You know, obviously I was saved from this catastrophic accident.  I should have died.  And so there's a reason obviously that I'm here.  And I feel like that is just to make the world a better place, uh, show people that, you 
[01:32:30]  know, whatever happens to you, um, you, you can overcome it and make, make something  in your life and really invest in other people.  There's something about Scott too, cause I never stop for anyone, man.  And living in New York, you see a lot of weird crap going on, but there was, I mean, your  personality just was oozing.  And I go, I got to talk to this guy.  I, I, an observation though, you're cheating on your height today.  I say when I met him in the park, he was a lot shorter.  We were about the same height in the park and he walks in today. 
[01:33:00]  He's like six two.  I'm like, that's not one of the advantages.  Yeah.  You know, well, I'm, I'm about, uh, yeah.  I mean, if I want to get on a date, I can ask the girl, Hey, do you want a short  guy or a tall guy?  I was like, do you want a hot, I said, do you want to date a hobbit or a tall guy?  Yeah.  You know?  So, um, yeah, my brother, uh, when I had, when I had the second leg off, um, you know,  my brother was six foot tall and he's always been taller than me.  And so I, again, I just jacked up my legs so I can be taller than him.  Oh, he wants to tell you off too. 
[01:33:30]  So badly.  And my friend who's actually on the back of the truck is, he's still, uh, he's still  hacked off at me.  He's still five, seven.  Right.  You know, people ask me, were you ever bitter after the accident?  And I said, no, but my best friend still is.  So when you, when the accident occurred, when you were 18, obviously you, you attempted  to continue being an athlete and it was a, it was tough for you until they removed the  left leg in 98.  And then it was, then you've got, been going all out ever since.  Well, I mean, the way, the way my kind of athletic journey, I mean, I had, uh, you know, 
[01:34:00]  those 12 years there, the last three years of the, the, that 12 year period before I had  the other leg, I was addicted to prescription medications.  And then I finally had this other leg off and it kind of gave me this free life.  And I just wanted to live like a normal life and, you know, get married, have kids, stuff  like that.  And did you do all that?  I haven't found the right one yet and, uh, and I'm trying to find somebody to help me  with that.  So, um, I, uh, you know, I just started, I just went and I started working, uh, different,  you know, working in, and I just didn't really find myself, um, you know, find that purpose 
[01:34:30]  until, uh, December of 2005, Christmas of 2005.  I saw a lot of our soldiers, uh, men and women in the service who have put themselves on  harm's way for our freedom.  I saw them coming back from the war and it just really ripped my heart out.  And I thought that I've always had this, uh, uncanny ability to be able to balance and  walk on these prosthetics.  I played, you know, just sports like a softball and, and, and flag football and stuff like 
[01:35:00]  that, but never anything endurance.  And so, uh, I saw our men and women and I heard about this girl that actually did the  Ironman.  Uh, she was above the knee amputee.  She was actually on the front cover of runner's world in 2006 and 2000, uh, and triathlete  magazine on 2006.  And I said, you know what?  I, I, I need to do an Ironman.  And so I told my friends, I said, Hey, I'm going to do an Ironman.  Well, I told them, if you look at me, I'm not built, I'm built like a linebacker.  Right.  You're stocky.  Yeah.  I'm not built like a, a marathon runner. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  A swimmer, a cyclist or a runner.  And so, um, I, uh, you know, I told my buddies I was going to do an Ironman, but I, I didn't  know how to, in January of 2006, I didn't know how to swim.  I didn't own a bike and I'd never run farther than a mile on a set of prosthetics.  And I told them I was going to swim 2.4 miles in the ocean.  I was going to ride 112 miles on a bike and then through the lava fields of Hawaii at 110  heat index.  And I was going to run a full marathon, 26.2 miles.  I was going to do it all under 17 hours. 
[01:36:00]  And, um, that, that really started my journey.  Uh, my first small distance triathlon, a 600 meter swim, a 12 mile bike ride and a 5k run  was April 22nd of 2006.  Well, fast forward one year and eight months and I finished one of the toughest endurance  races on the planet.  So it really took me zero to Ironman in a year and eight months.  So you have it.  Look, you, you're wearing one, uh, a pair of, uh, the prosthetics now, I just have sneakers  and the, obviously for just getting around and walking and then you have two other ones 
[01:36:30]  with you.  One, which is, uh, a fitted, uh, it's, it's kind of, uh, like almost locks around a bike  pedal.  Yeah.  And the other one, it looks almost like a scoop, like a very thin, like almost like an  ice cream scoop.  And what is, what is, what is, like a spatula, like a curved spatula, like a Russian sickle.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  What is that one for?  Yeah.  The, um, that's for running.  The first, the, the first one that you were talking about that kind of looks like an upside,  you know, it's like a trident, you know, and where it has the cleat, the, the bicycle 
[01:37:00]  cleat.  I ride a normal bike just like everybody else.  And, um, and, and so my clip into the pedals just like everybody else.  How do you get off?  Clip in?  Like you're locked in?  Like if the bike started to tip over, could you jump off it?  Um, yeah, I would need, I would need to, to twist my knee.  Most people twist their ankle, but I need to twist my knee to pop out.  Yeah, Jamie, most of these guys are locked into their pedals these days to begin with.  So yeah, real, real bicyclists, they, they lock in, but they can twist real fast and they  can get out.  So what are you saying?  He has to twist from the knee to get on. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  All you need to do is just press down and the pedal locks in and, uh, the cleat locks into  the pedal.  And so you're locked in, you get more power that way.  I saw him on the, uh, the running spatula thing.  I'll call it the spatula thing.  And he was just bouncing the whole time I was talking to him because it's hard to bounce  on those obviously, but you can run like a mother effer.  Yeah.  There's, uh, the, you know, you're bound, I'm balancing 200 pounds on three square inches.  Right.  And so, you know, it's like, uh, um, it's, it doesn't, you know, kind of give me any kind  of a technical advantage or anything like that. 
[01:38:00]  But what it does is, it's just simply just like running shoes.  It just cushions the blow of, uh, of running.  Yeah.  Do you, uh, did you ever have, or how long did you have, I guess you did like, like phantom  feelings for where you, like when you're running, do you, can you feel anything below  the knee?  Does your mind tell you that there's something going on?  Because they say that when you, when you lose a limb, you have phantom pain, all that  stuff.  Yeah.  I haven't really, I haven't really had, um, phantom pains because, uh, one, uh, the left,  the right leg was taken off by trauma, but still, even then it was, uh, the surgeon had 
[01:38:30]  enough time to do a very good amputation.  And the elective, uh, the left leg was taken off by, by, by choice, but still it was, uh,  you know, it was taken off, um, you know, in, in, in a textbook kind of way where our  soldiers, the real phantom pains, I haven't had those, but the real phantom pains that our  soldiers are having is these, um, makeshift, you know, bombs and stuff like that are shattering  some of the bones.  And so they take off a leg, but the bone fragments are, are going into the leg and the bone doesn't 
[01:39:00]  realize that it's not, it's, it's not, it's separated.  Yeah.  And so it, it creates a bone spur and really starts to grow into these guys like muscles  and nerve endings and stuff like that.  And that's really the, the, you know, a story that a lot of people don't understand that  these guys are facing over here.  It's just not, oh, wow, they lost a leg.  Hey man, they lost a leg and this bone fragments from these crazy bombs are, are, are growing 
[01:39:30]  and they're growing into tissue.  When they took your leg in 98, where did the leg end up?  My, my dad, uh, you know, I think I donated it to, to research because at that time, back  in 1986, the, the skin graft that they had done was very radical surgery.  And, uh, and so they, they, they're using it or, or I guess they, they used it, I donated  it.  I was going to ask, is it still around somewhere?  No, no.  Yeah, it's on Craigslist.  eBay.  eBay.  And the other thing, uh, so getting back to the triathlon, we got to take a break here, 
[01:40:00]  but I could talk to Scott all day.  Um, you don't use anything when you're doing the swim.  So when you're swimming, it's all just upper body in the water.  Yeah, man.  I can't get rid of these shoulders.  You can tell, man.  Look at, I mean, he's got the body.  He's got the swimming shoulders, right?  Yeah.  I can't get rid of these shoulders.  Uh, so you can't kick nothing, you can't even kick kind of with your thighs or?  No, I mean, I lose 25% proportion, uh, on the swim because there isn't a kick there.  Are you just exhausted from swimming without legs?  No, not really.  I mean, it, you know, it's just, I just have to practice a lot and, and get my, my, uh, swim 
[01:40:30]  endurance up.  I mean, I, I, you know.  Go and you paddle?  No, no, no.  I swim freestyle.  Well, but in, in Hawaii, I, I, that was only the, uh, that was the longest that I ever  swam, and that was only the fourth time that I'd ever swam in the ocean.  Uh, and I did, I did 2.4 miles in the ocean in an hour and 28 minutes.  Wait, how many miles?  It was 2.4 miles in the ocean.  It's a 2.4 mile swim?  Yeah.  In the ocean. 
[01:41:00]  The Hawaiian Ironman is a 2.4 mile swim in the ocean.  Yeah.  It's, and you have to do it, you have to do it in, in 2 hours and 20 minutes.  Or they, or they, or they, they pull you, they pull you out of that course.  Right.  And then you have to do the swim in the bike in 10 hours and 30 minutes.  And so I, I finished the swim portion in an hour and 28 minutes.  It took me about 8 hours on the bike, and I finished in just under probably 40 minutes  before the cutoff on the bike.  You finished the total.  Now, you had 17, it said here you did it in 16?  16 hours and 42 minutes. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, I was cutting it kind of close.  So, so literally the 17 hour time limit was not a personal thing.  You said that was their rules.  No, that's their rules.  You have to finish those three disciplines.  Right.  The 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike ride, full marathon.  You have to finish that in 17 hours.  All right, listen, we got to take a break.  We got Scott Rigsby in studio, double amputee.  A lot of the military guys are thanking you for, you know, speaking so highly about the military  and what these guys have been through.  Yeah, man, it's my privilege.  The Marines flew me into Camp Lejeune, spent time with 150 of their family members, and 
[01:42:00]  just loved on them.  I've been to, they used my cycling feet at Walter Reed.  Right.  I've been to Balboa Naval Base, so I've got invites to the center for the Intrepid.  So, yeah.  Awesome.  If you want to stick around, I'm sure we'll have a few more questions for you, but we got  Philippe Petit.  Is he here?  Yeah, man on wire.  It's his documentary we're going to talk about for a little bit, and then hopefully we'll  get back to Scott's story.  But it's scottrigsby.com, R-I-G-S-B-Y, scottrigsby, one word, .com. 
[01:42:30]  And it's called Promoting the Scott Rigsby Story, Unthinkable, and it's a short film, and  it's available now on scottrigsby.com.  Yeah, and then also, I'm one of the top ten followers for the Energizer Keep It Going  Hall of Fame Award.  I get to meet Kyle Ripken, and it's an award that Energizer puts out.  The voting ends July 25th.  If you want to vote for me, go to my website, click on the Energizer Bunny.  You just won.  You have no idea what our fans are capable of. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, just tell them to go to my website.  Let's put Scott over the top, because this guy, he was an inspiration to me after just  meeting him in the park for 20 minutes.  Yeah, just go to my website, click on the bunny, and you can go right to Energizer site  and vote.  And by the way, screw Kyle Ripken.  You got to meet Jimmy Norton.  That's true.  And I've met Kyle Ripken.  My man, Jimmy.  Yeah, we've met Kyle, and you know what?  He's a bore.  Yeah.  He really is.  You have much more fun here.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Good for you.  You can hit the ball.  I'd love to stay around.  Yeah.  Yeah, thanks.  We'll throw you over there.  We'll get Philippe in, and then we'll get back to Scott.  Great.  Very busy show. 
[01:43:30]  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Hey, this is Mike DiStefano.  Please come and listen to me do my comedy show.  Please.  I'll be in Chicago at the Lakeshore Theater, July 25th and 26th.  You can call them at 773-472-3492.  773-472-3492.  And go to their website, lakeshoretheater.com. 
[01:44:00]  I smell dead people.  I farted.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning to everybody.  It's The Opie and Anthony Show.  Jimmy and I today, 877-212-ON-A.  Also, Nick DePauw helping us out.  We've got Scott Rigsby, the double amputee that completed the Hawaii-ing.  Hawaii-ing. 
[01:44:30]  The Hawaiian Ironman triathlon.  And now we say good morning to Philippe Petit on our couch.  I can't believe you're actually sitting here.  We're huge fans of yours, sir.  We've been talking about you for a long time.  Even before the documentary, we were always talking about you.  Because there's another guy, Alain Robert, who you probably know.  He climbs buildings.  No, I don't know.  Yeah, he doesn't use a wire.  He just climbs the buildings, which is pretty easy.  I think he knows them, but he doesn't want to acknowledge them, which is cool. 
[01:45:00]  I like that.  Yeah, glorified window washer.  I think what you did was harder.  Everybody knows you.  You walked on a tightrope in between the Twin Towers.  Yeah, I don't try to do things that are harder, harder.  I'm interested in beautiful theater in the sky.  All right.  I've never heard it put that way before.  Yeah, that is that.  Well, the book I have, my ex-girlfriend, who did eventually leave me, got me your book for Christmas last year. 
[01:45:30]  Because I've been kind of obsessed with you for a long time.  She's got good taste.  Yeah, she really does.  She left me for a gentleman of color.  Yuck.  In books, I meant.  Still a fan, Jimmy?  Yeah, of course I am.  And I knew he'd be an interesting interview, because you do have a very poetic, odd way of looking at the world.  You're not a typical guy.  I couldn't be.  Not to do that, I suppose not. 
[01:46:00]  Was there ever a moment, because my greatest fear is heights, and Nick was talking about the terror of heights,  where you're in the middle of walking across, in between these buildings, and you just thought, what am I doing here?  No, no.  I had been thinking of being between those towers for many, many years, even before they were built.  So when I found myself there, it was by choice, not by chance.  And I loved it.  You had no fear of falling?  I mean, even as a guy who goes...  It's very logic, my answer, and it's not a pun. 
[01:46:30]  It's reality.  I had no fear of falling, because I could not fall.  If not, I would be fearful, of course, and I would run away in fear.  But because I cannot fall, because I put myself in a state of psychological and tangible certitude, solidity,  I can enter in this fragile world with knowing I will do the final step victoriously.  So what are you thinking as you're walking across?  I mean, there's one part where I think you said you focused on the other building, on a piece of metal. 
[01:47:00]  Is that what you actually looked at?  Yeah, yeah.  One nice way, when you're on a tightrope, try it one day, and believe me, it's the right way.  Look at where the wire is tied on the other side.  It's a bit like the horizon on a long walk, and that makes you feel like you're part of a rigid system.  But in this walk, as you know, I walked many times, eight times.  My friends told me I didn't have a machine to measure my walks, but I stayed there like almost 45 minutes.  And during that time, I actually looked down, looked around. 
[01:47:30]  You sat down on the wire.  Yes, I sat down on the wire.  You laid down on the wire.  And how high up were the Twin Towers, like a quarter mile?  Just a quarter of a mile.  Something like that?  Yeah, yeah.  A quarter mile in the air.  That would knock the wind out of you.  No kidding.  I used towers in the world at the time.  Sure.  This photo here, this is to me, I mean, they're all horrifying photos, but this one I'll show  Nick is in between the towers, and he is, you could be lounging on a hammock somewhere.  So let me correct you.  There's nothing horrifying about this picture. 
[01:48:00]  It's glorifying about the Twin Towers, and it's magnificent about seeing a man becoming  half a bird.  It's glorifying to you, horrifying for every single human being out there.  Philippe, how do you explain that you don't have an affair of heights, but somebody like  me or Jimmy, is that genetics?  No, no, no.  I was not born as a wire worker.  I actually fought for it because I was not born in the circus world.  And my parents and the teachers and the whole powers that be around me as a teenager said, 
[01:48:30]  no, no, no.  And my intuition was, yes, yes, yes.  So I became a natural climber.  At six years old, I climbed everywhere, played with ropes like little kids do.  And I found myself at 16, 17, learning by myself, which is very unusual, the art of wire  walking.  So I have no fear because I loved it all along.  You see, if I force you to get on a wire, you're going to resist and say, oh, I'm scared.  But if you leave from your childhood climbing everywhere, it's very natural that you're going  to become a wire walker.  Carl Wallenda fell to his death. 
[01:49:00]  I mean, obviously, a very accomplished guy on the wire.  Was that after, I think, you did this?  Or was that before you did that, when he fell?  Oh, after.  It was after.  OK, so you didn't have that.  Would seeing that have kind of slowed you down at all or it wouldn't have stopped you?  No, but it's always a good lesson.  I was actually invited to perform where he did.  And I went to Puerto Rico and I studied the wind and I say, I'm not interested in his assignment.  What was the mistake he made that day?  Just not reading the conditions?  Well, I refuse to talk about how people could have felt if they're not in front of me to 
[01:49:30]  refute me.  But as a wire walker, I know that I will never do a walk when I await all the odds.  And for example, if I propose a place to walk where it's very windy, I will study the wind  and I might say no, which I said in this specific...  Well, all right.  Going with that.  So the day you decided to walk between the Twin Towers, if it was windy up there, you  weren't going to go?  No, it was windy and by nature, there was turbulence there, which is like mad wind that 
[01:50:00]  you cannot control.  And I knew that from my homework and for dozens and hundreds of visits, sneaking up while the  towers were being built or finished almost.  So I don't know.  I don't believe in gods, but I think the gods believe in me.  Sure.  So you visited the towers dozens of times before this?  No, hundreds of times.  Hundreds of times.  I was in New York eight months street juggling to survive.  I was passing my hat.  So you were street juggling and then you were sneaking into the towers when you could.  Well, I had to disguise myself as an architect or a worker or a journalist.  Reporter, journalist. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  And then I sneak in a building thousands of times.  Wow.  I have friends taking pictures, measuring things, daydreaming.  It's important to daydream when you're building a dream.  You're meticulous because that's what I took away from the documentary.  This wasn't like a whim.  You really studied the towers and you really prepared.  You went back to your hometown and even when you were practicing, you know, the conditions  that you thought would be happening that day, you even had your friends shaking the wire  to try to knock you down.  Absolutely.  And we have a wonderful, true footage of that that was shot at the time. 
[01:51:00]  So this film is marvelous because it's a modern tailing and at the same time going back 34  years and showing amazing footage that survived, you know, all those dozens of years.  Now, there's video of you doing some other tightrope walks.  Why didn't you get the Twin Towers thing filmed?  Why didn't you have a buddy up there?  I wanted to.  I had.  I had my friend who shot the arrow with the bow.  He was a photographer, so we took pictures, but we had rented a 16 millimeter camera and 
[01:51:30]  I said, take a few pictures, but run to the camera and press the red button.  I want a live footage.  And he was about to do that when the police came to his roof.  So he has to hide and he went down and his pictures ended up all over the world in the  front page, but no film, which at the time I was really, really upset.  And now I think it adds to the legend.  Mystique.  Yeah.  I mean, the towers are even no longer there.  It looks like, did I dream all this?  Am I, I am, you know, am I inventing all this?  I'm sure you've given that guy a scolding over the years though. 
[01:52:00]  Well, why are you hiding?  You should have got arrested for me.  So we have some video of this.  No, no.  But then the pictures have been confiscated and you know, the world would have not.  Oh, so they would have taken, right, right, right, right.  Oh yeah, yeah.  No, it was, it was a caper story.  Now, you, I'll get, Jimmy, you got it.  So you actually looked down at one point and there was a photo of you, I guess, balancing  yourself where you kind of go down onto the wire and your leg is hanging down and you,  and you said you took a look down because you'd never see that view.  Yes, I do that actually not in the middle of a performance, but sometimes, yes, I stop 
[01:52:30]  performing and I do a little thing for my own pleasure and it is often to sit on the  wire, let's say on a very long and high wire and then to look around and look down.  And it's amazing because it's a view that, it is true, I will never, never have again.  Each walk is very different and at the top of the world, you know, 1,350 feet in the  air.  Right.  I had to look around and I recorded magnificent images.  Yeah, nobody, nobody will have that view.  You're the only one.  No, nobody did and nobody will.  Nobody will.  Now, we were talking about this whole thing earlier this morning. 
[01:53:00]  We really thought it was like a wire in a bag.  You throw the wire to the other side, no big deal.  I learned through the documentary, something like a half ton of equipment?  No, no, almost a ton.  Almost a ton of equipment.  You had to sneak into the Twin Towers.  Yeah, divided in two crews, the North crew with the little equipment, the bow and arrow  and the South crew, me and a friend.  A few accomplices, I fired a few hours before to sneak in the building because they were incapable.  So, we were not enough people on my tower and we had almost a ton of equipment. 
[01:53:30]  Right.  And you had to sneak in through the freight elevators and this and that and add fake badges.  You've got to be a good criminal, too.  Well, I am, I am.  I was born a criminal.  I mean, an artistic criminal.  So, you know, I can go to school and talk to students and tell them, you know, go on  and pursue your dreams.  There's nothing illegal about that, although maybe there is these days.  And the biggest thing, you had to figure out how to get the wire from one building  to the other and you finally decided on the arrow.  No, I didn't decide.  It was my friend.  Your friend came on.  I decided and I thought it was a ridiculous idea.  Don't bother me with a bow.  Well, how were you going to do it if you didn't have your practice? 
[01:54:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Before you say that, how did you think you were going to get the wire across?  Throw it.  This is ridiculous.  It's in my book.  I share with the reader all the ways.  One of the ways was I was thinking of a little radio-guided helicopter with a fishing line.  But those things, first, you need three years to master them, okay?  I went to a specialized shop and the guy says, forget it.  Plus, he made a demo for me and it makes so much ruckus.  The whole lower Manhattan would have woken up, you know?  So, but the bow and arrow was beautiful and it worked. 
[01:54:30]  Except I was thinking, what if the arrow pierced my heart?  And in the morning, the cops are really puzzled.  They see a dead French man with an arrow in his heart and they say, you know, what's going on?  But it didn't happen.  Yeah, and then you decide on the arrow with the fishing line.  And then in the middle of the night, you finally, well, your buddy, right?  He shot the arrow across?  Yeah, on the north tower, he shot across.  And then we pulled out as you can imagine.  Well, you're skipping a step and I have to give this away because I found it a little strange.  It's very dangerous for me to skip steps.  I understand, but you couldn't, you didn't, you weren't sure if the arrow made it to your side with the fishing line. 
[01:55:00]  So, very strange.  You decide you needed to get completely naked to.  Yeah, but you're telling about the film.  Don't see the film.  A little bit.  That's not going to give everything away.  Yeah, it is true because, you know, imagine this is a comic movie in itself.  You're in the middle of the night, totally dark.  And you're looking for an invisible nylon fishing line.  I mean, so I thought after a few attempts, I thought he missed.  Maybe the arrow is in New Jersey, you know?  So, yeah, I took my clothes off and I looked and then I could feel on my legs a little caress of a fishing line. 
[01:55:30]  It was the most beautiful caress I ever had on those legs for years.  No, it's not true.  Well, then you attach something else to the fishing line and you slowly get up to…  Yeah, a heavy cord and a new rope.  And then when it was strong enough, that rope, a thick rope, could actually pull a very heavy steel cable across.  And we are all kind of troubled and the police came.  But anyway, read the book and see the film. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, we will.  Nothing you say is going to cause people to not want to see this film because, I mean, first of all, everybody knows you live.  So, it's not like, well, does he die at the end?  So, it's how did he do it?  It's not like the Bible.  Hold on, hold on.  What is fabulous about this film is that there is a suspense.  And even I, I'm supposed to be the guy, I'm supposed to know I made it.  Well, I am on the edge of my seat when I am in a dark theater full of people.  I am laughing and crying and applauding with them.  And I want to know the outcome.  Is he going to make it?  So, it's a good film.  It's a great film, actually. 
[01:56:30]  You're so animated and you really make it by how you're describing everything.  I was also interested in all the people around you that are interviewed in this and all the people that helped you with this that are in this film that talk about what they were feeling and how they didn't think you.  It's a very interesting group of people that all talk about what went into making this happen because everybody just obviously thinks of you instead of realizing that there were friends and then there was a girlfriend and there was all this stuff that went on behind the scenes.  The girlfriend and all this stuff, yes. 
[01:57:00]  Why did he get naked again?  I don't understand.  Just the feel of the fishing line.  A little strange, yes.  I'm with you on that, Nick.  Yeah, yeah.  How about a flashlight there?  You sort of glossed over that.  Yeah, I got naked on the field.  How about a flashlight?  Look around a little bit.  What is that on my box?  Are you going to do any more walking to that extent?  I know you're still performing all that, but I mean, are you thinking of another?  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Oh, yeah.  Obviously, nothing as huge as the Twin Towers.  Well, I have small, medium, and giant walks. 
[01:57:30]  I'm not trying to collect the gigantic, but it looks, when I look back at my life, I have done big things.  But I have many projects.  One of them is quite mysterious.  It's to attach my rope or my wire to the belly of those big statues in Easter Island.  The more I, there are sacred statues, and I will be like a very mysterious out-of-the-world walk.  So, things like that interest me, and they almost look like they have their room in a movie rather than in real life.  But I continue to perform.  I continue to write books. 
[01:58:00]  I'm writing my seventh book right now.  Wow.  And I continue.  I also lecture on creativity, and I'll go to people and tell them how I work by myself.  I discover juggling, magic.  It's a life that is a life of passion, and as long as life continues, I will continue to exercise those passions.  Do you think your skills have diminished now that you're older?  No, no, no.  I think, I'm not older.  I'm much younger.  I am more knowledgeable, more masterful.  No, I think my skills, yes, physically, the body is saying, leave me alone, I'm getting old. 
[01:58:30]  But I disregard that.  I think it's the mind that pulls the body.  You had a guest before who is racing around the world, and his legs are new legs.  So, I salute that.  You know, my hat off.  Can you get him on a wire, maybe?  Yeah, absolutely.  Now, that would be it.  Absolutely.  Scott, what do you think?  Hey, maybe that's the next challenge.  This man has undoubted spirits, and you can do anything.  That's basically what this film, Man on Wire, is telling, is that if you have a dream, stick to it, and nothing is impossible.  So, yes, I continue to walk the highway, absolutely. 
[01:59:00]  I had a question for him.  Sure.  Scott Rigsby, yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Mentally prepared, I mean, when I did the Ironman, it was more mentally draining than physically draining, so I had to prepare myself mentally.  So, over and over, I dreamed about crossing that finish line.  I dreamed about every portion of the race, the swim, the bike, and the run.  Did you do that when you were preparing for these performances?  Well, the chemistry of the victory that you just outlined is exactly the one I believe in, except I am not formulating it so clearly as you just did, and I'm not living through it so exactly. 
[01:59:30]  But it's intuitively.  I know if I look at how I prepare for a high-war walk for the past 45 years, it's exactly what you said.  It's much more in the head.  And, you know, if the body is asleep, you wake it up, and you pull it by the sleeve.  I mean, the body is an instrument.  Sure.  So, that's why I'm not really interested in those climbers and those stuntmen who do, you know, impossible things.  It doesn't move me, because where is the human theater? 
[02:00:00]  Where is the soul, you know?  The mechanical work of a human body doesn't interest me.  You have to inspire me.  You have to move me.  You have to be a poet, you know?  And that cannot be explained.  Nope.  Could someone climbing, though, have the same – could someone who climbs buildings – I mean, it's amazing to me that the guy does it without equipment.  Could he have that same spirit that you have?  He's just not a tightrope walker.  Well, but it will look differently than just climbing and climbing and stopping.  Yeah, he's calling it.  And climbing.  He basically picked it.  Somebody will make an opera vertical on a facade and turn around and do a kind of ballet, and you call it theater in the sky. 
[02:00:30]  I will be the first one moved by it.  And when I see a human being getting higher or longer than the other guy and, you know, do climbing nine peaks within eight hours to be in a book of records,  I think these people don't understand life.  Life is not to be the highest, the strongest, and the newest.  Life is to be meaningful and to inspire people and to do something beautiful.  So really – and since I was not born in the world of the circus, from the beginning I took the wire as a stage. 
[02:01:00]  What interested me was theater.  Of course, my stage is kind of thin, and I'm not allowed to make one mistake because I won't be here to talk about it.  But that's the beauty of my theater.  It's a theater where you have to put your life entirely, not gamble it, but, you know, carry it across in full focus.  Jimmy basically saying they're hacks, and all they're doing is climbing a really, really tall ladder.  Philippe, can I ask – you said you've been doing this 40 years? 
[02:01:30]  No, much more.  Can I ask how old you are?  Yeah, I'm kind of 60 or something like that.  Getting close to the big six of me.  But, you know, I have disregard.  I know teenagers that are already dead, and I know 95 years old people who are my best young friends.  Right, right.  Hey, you've never answered the question why.  Oh, yes, I did answer.  I said there is no why.  Yeah, but that's how you answered it, I guess.  Well, you know, I think also it's –  Because that's the obvious question everyone would want to ask you.  Why would you, like, walk between the towers? 
[02:02:00]  A real painter, if you interrupt the painter who should be painting all day long by such a foolish question why, the real artist painter will not know why.  Or the answer will be, well, I have no choice.  I wake up and I have to paint.  If you think and if you realize why, it's something else.  So I always had this kind of passionate calling.  I mean, I didn't decide to put a why between the Twin Towers.  The Twin Towers called me.  I was a young, self-proclaimed, self-taught why walker. 
[02:02:30]  I wanted to use the why as a stage, how absurd, how poetic.  And then I was looking for great places.  And then I see six years before they were built, I see an announcement that one day those towers will be built.  And right there, as an 18-year-old imbecile –  You're giving away the movie.  You're giving away your own movie there, Philippe.  I'm following your example from the beginning.  But anyway, you're right.  This movie can be seen even if you know what the subject is.  Now, what are you scared of?  Well, I'm scared of things crawling on the floor with too many legs or with not enough legs, like snakes and spiders. 
[02:03:00]  I'm not very comfortable.  But that's stupid.  It's because I didn't put my mind into studying them, you see.  Well, how about we put a few of those on the wire and we get a little –  Oh, well, I have –  We'll make it a little more interesting for you.  What if I am across the Grand Canyon and I see a tarantula coming?  Well, I'll have to think about that.  You ever thought about snakes?  You ever thought about doing the Grand Canyon?  Yes, yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, I had a big project there and it's still semi-alive.  But I need an art angel to sign a check. 
[02:03:30]  You know, it's always the same.  I'm not the only artist who needs the motor to his dreams.  Got you.  What's it called?  Obviously, the balancing pole.  The balancing pole.  Now, put your hands facing the sky like this.  How – people on radio don't know.  How long actually is that?  Well, it depends of the walk and it depends of the wind I'm going to meet up there.  And it depends of the tension of the wire and what I'm going to do on that wire.  So it's a dancing parameters.  But at the World Trade Center, it was enormously heavy. 
[02:04:00]  It was 40 pounds and it was 28 feet long because I knew I would have to be fighting turbulence.  And I knew at that height I would be so fragile.  I needed my arms to be longer and heavier.  I mean, this is not a trick.  The balancing pole, if you don't know how to maneuver it, it's going to make you fall of the wire left or right.  But once you know how to move it around, it helps you a little bit stay on that wire.  If you were to drop that, if for whatever reason you were to drop it, would you have been able to make it to the edge of the wire? 
[02:04:30]  I'm really not a good guy to answer the if questions.  I always frown at, you know, if you were a tree, what tree would you be?  Well, I'd be a solid oak.  But anyway, so there is no if for me.  But if – I know there is no if because I cannot put myself in the mind of what if.  You see, I narrow all the unknown into a moment where I am certain nothing will happen to me.  So I cannot entertain the idea.  If I drop my pole, I cannot drop my balancing pole. 
[02:05:00]  I cannot be allowed to drop it, you know.  But don't you have a process of elimination you go through where you have to go through the worst-case scenarios to prepare you to deal with them?  No, no, no.  It's not that.  You do positive creative visualization.  Well, it's half and half because when I train, I think of Murphy is the worst scenario.  I think a big wind or I think something breaking in the wire.  But because I am the engineer for my project and I direct my rigging crew and I practice sometimes even with the right direction of the wind for months before a big walk, 
[02:05:30]  then as you can imagine, if you were following me for months before a walk, you would not say this guy is crazy.  You would say this guy is crazy about details and about respecting his life and the life of the buildings and he doesn't leave anything to chance.  And what is Murphy is a thief that, you know, used chance to bother you.  So I cannot be attacked there.  There is no if for me.  But then when you're going through something like, aren't you going through, like when you're checking the building out and you're going through,  you're going through so many steps to make sure that it was going to work.  You are in a way looking at, well, if security is here or if this guy is here or if this doesn't work, this is how I get around that. 
[02:06:00]  Okay.  In the case of the World Trade Center adventure, it was illegal, as you know, and there was a lot, a lot of question mark.  What if in the middle of my walk, some guard comes and start banging on the cable?  I mean, that would be the if that there was nothing I could do.  But it's not true because I was looking constantly on both sides.  You know, I did U-turns and I walked back and forth and I was really looking at any human being approaching the anchor points.  And if they would have approached the anchor point, I would probably stop walking, sit on the wire, hold myself with one hand. 
[02:06:30]  All this, in a way, is answering your question of if.  But it's just that it's my knowledge of the wire that saves me and my knowledge of myself.  If I thought I was invincible, I would already be dead.  You see, there is a certain humbleness in being the best at what you do.  Jimmy, we got to take a break.  Man on Wire is the documentary.  Where can people see that?  Is it in theaters?  It's got a limited release.  I know we have it.  I don't even know if we have the list of where it is.  I know you can go to Man on Wire. 
[02:07:00]  There's no the.  It's tempting to say the, but it's not.  Manonwire.com.  And I'm sure that will give certain dates as to where you can see it.  Yeah, it's opening within hours in New York City.  So it's going to take New York by storm.  And I know the New Yorkers, it's going to be their film because it's their towers.  Who needs to see Dark Knight when you can see Man on Wire?  Well, there's a big difference.  It is a very interesting documentary.  It's a very interesting thing.  It really gets you inside of Philippe's headspace and what was going on. 
[02:07:30]  And it really was a very fascinating thing to watch.  And I knew a lot about you just because I read the book and I watched a lot of stuff on you over the years.  And I still found myself really interested in watching this.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  It's a pleasure, Philippe.  Thank you very much.  Philippe Petit.  We're going to wrap up next.  Stay there.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-WOW1-WOW.  Cell phone and VDA users, send your message to feedback at opiananthony.com. 
[02:08:00]  We've got a busy, busy show.  Actually, we've got to wrap up pretty much.  I want to thank Nick DiPaolo for stopping by.  Nickdip.com.  Nickdip.com.  That's right, Nick.  We have a lift bar.  This is kind of uncomfortable, by the way, watching Danny examine Scott's legs.  Yeah.  He's examining them.  Well, he brought all sorts of legs in today.  I want to thank Scott for bringing all his legs in today.  What did you think of Philippe Petit there?  Your hero. 
[02:08:30]  I mean, he's an odd guy.  He's an artist.  He gives artistic answers.  I mean, but he's just a very interesting dude.  I mean, look, here's the bottom line.  The guy did what he did.  Yeah.  It's an amazing feat.  I don't agree with him when he says, like, the pictures aren't horrifying.  To us, they are because we can't do that.  Of course they're horrifying.  He's a mime on a wire.  Yeah.  And he's romanticizing the whole thing.  I'm sure he beats the crap out of that guy that didn't turn on the damn video camera.  Yeah.  He came up with a good answer.  You know how cool it is that you don't have video of one of the greatest things to ever happen in New York. 
[02:09:00]  It's called rationalization.  Yeah, exactly.  No, he's beating the crap out of the guy.  He looks great for his age, though.  I mean, he's going to be 60, and he's going to plummet to his death.  And I was ready to tell him that, but then I felt maybe I shouldn't.  He looks like he's 40, though.  I mean, it was freakish, man.  As soon as you start thinking that your mind can still get things done, that's when you're in trouble.  Well, that's true.  Because he said, no, man, I'm older, and I'm more experienced, and I got more knowledge.  And the whole time I'm thinking, wow, we're going to read about this guy in the next few years. 
[02:09:30]  What do you think Walenda said?  Yeah, exactly.  He wasn't going, oh, I can't do it anymore physically.  Well, Walenda's things, Walenda probably, hopefully, Philippe seems like he's smarter than,  because Walenda's things weren't tied off right, and I think that's why he had so much wobble.  And I got, the documentary was interesting, man.  It was a really interesting thing to watch.  Yeah, I'm definitely going to check it out.  There was a trap that they had to go through and navigate, and all these weird little blockades  to get by to pull this off.  Yeah, you're going to be, I mean, he had to have, like, a good criminal mind to pull off  that. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, he was a big fan of, uh.  I knew nothing about it.  I thought he had permission and stuff.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's kind of a tough one to get them aside off.  I met an inside guy.  He met this guy who was an inside guy that got him building IDs.  It was just, uh.  Very involved.  Very, very involved.  It took years and years of planning.  That's positive thinking.  I don't believe.  Well, these guys that climb the buildings literally do.  I mean, they can study it by themselves, but they could probably pull that off by themselves  because all you've got to do is study what you have to study and then go up.  But to have to have a whole other, two teams and both people to have to sneak by and get 
[02:10:30]  up and shoot an arrow across.  Just that alone.  It's like, really?  Yeah, exactly.  If I suggested that, I'd be like, what do you get out of here with that stupid?  And I would root for it not to make it so I didn't have to do it.  But I don't understand, and it was probably too technical to really get into.  So you've got the main wire, and then he had two other wires to kind of anchor it down  to keep it a little stiffer.  Yeah.  How did he get those wires across the main wire and then anchored down where they were 
[02:11:00]  anchored down?  I don't get that.  I don't remember the answer, but they do give it.  They do give, because that's a very critical thing.  Like, you see a wire, and I forget what they're called.  But they almost come, it looks like a kite almost, from the point on the wire that they're  tied to the building structure.  Right.  So there is a way that they did it, and it was done for this walk, and I forget how  they did it.  But how do they attach those two other wires to the main wire?  Yeah, do they drill?  Do they have to drill holes?  Maybe it was all attached to begin with?  I don't know.  You don't just tie it off.  Yeah.  It's a technical thing. 
[02:11:30]  It's obviously a knot they tie.  It's obviously metal.  Maybe there's a little clamp or something they put on a wire.  But you could see them.  You see photos of him walking.  You can see, like, little...  I'm kind of bummed.  I wanted to ask him how it was working with Omar.  I can't believe we didn't ask that question.  Who?  Omar.  Man on wire.  He was on the...  Yeah.  Boom!  There was something sweet about that.  Well, it says man on wire.  It's one of our favorite...  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  I just didn't get it.  I know.  I was trying.  Scott Rigsby, thank you for stopping by.  Thanks for having me.  What are we promoting as we leave everybody today?  Well, it's...  Oh, I'm sorry.  What?  Oh, you're talking to me?  Oh, okay, yeah.  No, I'm talking to the wall.  What do you think?  ScottRigsby.com.  The Energizer Going the Distance Hall of Fame Award.  If you go to my site, click on the bunny.  Who are you up against, by the way?  Nine other finalists.  What are they, though?  Yeah.  Teachers, you know, cancer survivors. 
[02:12:30]  Inspirational people.  Yeah, inspirational people, yeah.  Let's put Scott Rigsby over the top and make sure he wins this award.  You go to ScottRigsby.com and you vote for Scott, right?  Right.  Yeah, just click on the bunny.  And what is he filming for?  Your website?  Actually, I did a show with Alan for Team Kids.  And it's just really telling Keynes about prosthetics and just overcoming adversity.  Right on.  Oh, Opie, look!  A picture!  Sorry.  What?  There's a picture right here of him with the wire tied off. 
[02:13:00]  You can take a look at it.  Oh, I know.  But how did he tie that off?  Just with a notch.  Just a little...  He'd do it like a shoe.  Some fat chicks hitting on the other end.  Yeah.  Just like a shoe.  Yes, Dunpring.  Yeah, it looks like they have those clamps that you have on guy wires that have tension  Oh, I know what you're talking about.  And you can actually tighten them or loosen them as you need to do.  So that was all set up.  And when he was getting the main wire from building to building, that rigging was already  set.  Yeah, they pre-rigged a certain amount.  And when they lock it down, they can tighten it up. 
[02:13:30]  They talk about that, though.  That's actually a really critical thing on the walk.  And the documentary actually goes into that, because I was wondering how they tied that  off.  Yeah.  I had the worst ideas.  I'm like, did they actually go to the ground with it?  I'm such a dope.  All right.  Well, way to end the show.  I'll be at Comics next weekend.  August 1st and 2nd.  And?  In Sag Harbor this weekend, Saturday night.  For who?  What gig is that?  Bay Street Theater or something?  Me and Fitzsimmons, Saturday night.  Yeah, it's a nice little theater in Sag Harbor out there on Long Island.  Ticket information.  Way out there on the North Shore. 
[02:14:00]  Is it?  Yeah.  Up in upstate New York.  All right.  Where is it?  Sag Harbor.  Is it like the Hamptons or something?  It's like north of the Hamptons.  Sure.  Yeah.  A lot of celebrities in that area.  Oh, no.  I don't want that.  Oh, yeah.  You'll probably have a bunch of celebrities in the audience.  ScottRigsbeat.com.  Scott, thank you.  Yeah, thanks so much, guys.  If you're not busy, we're going over to XM if you want to like curse and stuff.  Yeah, it'll be great.  All right.  We're going to continue over to XM.  You guys have a great day.  We'll see you soon. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa.  What were you going to say, Jimmy?  Nothing.  Well, we have to end professionally.  All right.  End professionally.  Tomorrow, Ann will be here because he's not doing well today.  But tomorrow.  And congratulations to Ann's sister who had the kid finally.  Oh, did she really?  After 11 months of pregnancy.  So that's good.  Oh, boy or girl?  I don't know.  I'm just finding out as we speak.  Now, the father was from Mastec.  Is that true?  All right.  We're out of here.  Thank you, Nick. 
[02:15:00]  We'll see you guys soon.  Bye.  Bye.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  Before you get pissed off at us, man, we have nothing to do with this.  What?  What is this?  Garbage!  You know what?  I can't take this anymore.  It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  Off the air.  Let's say racist things to each other. 
[02:15:30]  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  And really turn them off.  Excellence in broadcasting.  Our anus.  What?  Again?  Oh, oh.  Our anus.  What?  Stop.  Enough about the anus.  Ah, this is hurtful.  This is hurtful.  No one wants to hear this on their radio show. 
[02:16:00]  I'm going to collapse on our floor.  It's just potty mouth day.  You may feel shame, but all the same.  You are my knees in pain.  Opie.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  I don't know.  Anthony.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  I don't know.  Jim Norton.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  Shhh.  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever. 
[02:16:30]  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah.  Well, here we go.  Um, here we are, XM Satellite Radio.  We are live.  It's, uh, July 22nd to prove that.  Because sometimes I hear we're live and I'm at home and I get confused.  So, so you give the date and then people can figure it out on their, on their own.  And tomorrow, uh, Wednesday. 
[02:17:00]  Wednesday!  We have, uh, we have Randy Couture coming in.  He's promoting a book.  Yeah.  And I want to talk to Randy again because he's, uh, he is, if anybody saw, we've been yapping  about fucking, uh, Fedor, uh, Emelianenko.  And, uh, to the douchebag on Whackbag that thought I purposely didn't mention Tim Sylvia  to fucking, uh, uh, uh, to, oh my god, I'm blanking on, from the UFC, fucking, uh,  Dana White, uh, called in and thought I was avoiding that.  You're just, you're a fucking dope. 
[02:17:30]  I actually went on Whackbag.  I re-got my password just to smash this cocksucker.  Um.  I don't understand the people that claim they're fans and all they do is try to find things  wrong with the radio show.  You're not a fan at that point.  But like it was this.  No way.  But like it was this purposeful thing to avoid, like, I want to upset the, Dana, who  is brutally honest.  I would have mentioned Sylvia just to fucking hear him smash him.  Of course.  But, uh, you know, it's, it's our loss we didn't mention him because Dana White would  have gave us some headlines.  And he called in for my birthday to wish me a happy birthday to be, and I just didn't, 
[02:18:00]  I probably, I didn't grill him enough to this cocksucker's, uh, uh, satisfaction.  So fuck you, douchebag.  You know who you are.  Anyway, uh, the Sylvia of Fedor fight, uh.  I just saw the footage.  Amazing.  Sylvia is 6'8".  Yeah.  I mean, I think he weighed 263.  And, uh, Fedor's not as big as I thought.  He's only 6 feet tall, 230.  Only.  I would love to be 6 foot 230.  But to be a world-class heavyweight fighter, I mean, against guys like this, he, I mean, 
[02:18:30]  he just dismantled him in 36 seconds.  Um, and it wasn't a lucky shot.  He beat the fucking shit out of him.  Yeah.  And then choked him out.  But it was a mercy choking.  Yeah.  Because he could have knocked him unconscious once he was on the ground by pummeling him.  Right.  And he just got on top and choked him to be mercy.  Now, where are we at with affliction versus UFC?  UFC hates affliction, I think.  No, I understand all that.  But, I mean, uh, as far as popularity goes.  Oh, UFC kills it.  But is affliction gaining?  This fight, it wasn't as well done as the UFC shit.  Look at it.  Look at this fucking animal, how hard he hits.  Yeah.  It's just ridiculous. 
[02:19:00]  Affliction to me is not nearly as good as UFC.  Um, it was only this fight.  I paid $39.95 for 36 seconds of entertainment.  But it was worth it.  Well worth it.  I paid $200 to fuck for 30.  What I don't like about affliction, the UFC, their presentation's way better.  Much better.  With the octagon and all that.  I don't like seeing, you know, ultimate fighting in a boxing ring.  It was everything about the UFC.  Like, I watched the way they did the walkouts and stuff like that.  They're just something.  And it's not even the shit on affliction.  I just felt like it wasn't as fun. 
[02:19:30]  UFC is just a better production.  It's like, uh, but whatever.  I mean, that was just the first time I ever watched affliction.  I didn't care if they fucking brought them out in rickshaws.  I just wanted to see the fight.  So, uh, I'm assuming Dana White, uh, Dana White wants, uh, Fedor in the UFC.  Yeah, but Dana, like Dana said, Fedor just, he's, you know, he's apparently controlled by the Russian mob.  What?  You know, who have a little, uh, that's what I've heard.  And, uh, they want too much.  They want too much to, to bring him over.  But after seeing this fight, uh, you can't not want to see Fedor fight. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  He's a frightening guy.  I mean, he's a, he's a heavyweight and he's just, he, he's fucking, he's like a, a, a mule leg.  Right.  His fist.  I can't see anybody beating this guy.  No.  All right.  We, uh, Scott Rigsby, uh, made the walk.  Hey.  Good morning.  We were just being polite, by the way.  Thank you.  But what the hell?  You can hang.  No, I'm kidding.  Just uncomfortable?  I just nodded.  On radio, I nodded.  It's like, yeah.  I didn't say anything.  I just nodded.  That's effective on radio. 
[02:20:30]  I don't know if you noticed this, but, um, we, we walked maybe a block and the stairs  you get are pretty, pretty interesting.  Oh yeah, absolutely.  All my friends.  Do you notice that people are looking at you when you're walking and stuff?  Well, I don't really notice it, but my friends always tell me to walk ahead cause they like  to see people look at me.  That's exactly what I did.  I had you and Nick walk in so I could see everyone, you know, taking a look at you.  Because I mean.  But if you have pants on, I would challenge anyone, they would not, they would not know  you, you have two fake legs.  Yeah, I'd never get one look.  They just wouldn't know. 
[02:21:00]  No.  No.  I thought they were looking at my hairline.  Hey, we got breaking news.  Uh, Batman has been arrested.  That's great.  Batman has been arrested.  I love that.  And not for his performance either.  No.  I ain't Batman.  Are ya?  Why are you arresting me?  Why are you arresting me?  I gotta fight crime.  Yeah.  I was the mayor of Carmel, California.  Oh wait, that wasn't me.  Anyone else notice that Gotham City is actually Chicago? 
[02:21:30]  I noticed that in the fucking movies cause of the river, the water behind it.  How about you try to like, uh, you know, hide it a little bit with some CGI, maybe erase  a river or something.  That was Chicago.  E-Rock sent me a text, by the way, when he was seeing Batman.  Um, he's coming in.  He actually went to see it this weekend, and I got a nice text.  Yeah?  From, uh...  E to the rock.  Yeah.  Well, what do you think of the show so far?  What's your thoughts on Philippe Petit?  Um, a little weird after the interview, because he said he would do IDs, and then we get in 
[02:22:00]  the hallway, and he goes, no, no, no, no, no, I can't do this, can't do this, and he  freaked out.  And Roland kind of was going...  Did he like his time with us?  I couldn't tell.  His stool was too high.  He seemed cool, and then as soon as he got in the hallway, he kind of freaked out.  He's a strange bird.  He's a French goo gobbler, let's be honest.  Fucking...  People go, by the way, to watch people fall off the fucking wires.  Of course.  No one cares about the artistic merits of wire walking.  They're there to see, you know, a brain get squashed.  Nobody looks at him and goes, oh, artiste. 
[02:22:30]  Hold on, let me...  Mike?  Yeah, what?  He said you guys pronounced his name wrong.  He went, uh, did he pronounce my name wrong?  Why did he correct me then?  How was his name wrong?  I was going to...  Phil Pettit!  I was going to call him Phil Pettit, right.  No, but he said, he goes, um, he goes, I didn't know what to correct him in the middle  of the interview.  Well, how did he say his name?  How did he say his dumb name?  Phil Pettit.  I don't know, I guess, Phil Pettit.  That's what I said.  He did.  What the fuck we say wrong?  Phil Pettit.  That's what I said.  Put the accent on my cock.  Why doesn't he stop?  I don't know. 
[02:23:00]  Does he really want us to trash him tomorrow?  We'd be so nice to him.  What the fuck does he want?  No, that was him.  And then, I guess he's French.  That's what they do.  He's a glorified mime.  Why wouldn't they fucking, uh, why wouldn't he do IDs for us?  I don't know, because he goes, he goes, I am a date?  Oh, he's late.  Okay.  Yeah.  And then you're just right down the hallway.  Let's ask the publicist.  All right.  Did he have a good time?  He did have a good time.  He loved the interview.  He's a little weird, isn't he, Roland?  Yes.  He's flaky as a croissant.  What do you think his deal is?  Am I saying that right?  I don't know.  God damn fucking Leonard's leaving.  I don't know. 
[02:23:30]  All right.  Thank you.  You added a lot there, Roland.  I appreciate it.  I can't believe it's 60, though.  All right, listen.  Here we go.  Batman.  Is this the update on Batman?  All right.  Batman has been arrested.  Batman.  We're not going to acknowledge that his name is Christian Bale, by the way.  It's Batman.  Batman accused of assaulting mom and sis.  Batman was to be questioned by police over allegations he assaulted his mother and his mother.  He assault what?  His mother and sister. 
[02:24:00]  They're probably fucking Modi.  Yeah.  They're probably rambling about Heath Ledger's performance.  Exactly.  And he got tired of it and he clocked it.  Wait a minute.  A couple of quick backhands.  He assaulted his own mother and sister?  Apparently.  We don't know, though.  I thought it was just a mom and daughter.  No, no, no.  His own.  That makes it great.  Family.  It makes it hot.  No, probably.  You never want to punch your sister and mother in the face on the same day?  Who doesn't?  I know what that's all about, by the way.  They all stop bleeding in the same week.  You're like, Jesus fucking Christ.  Get off my back.  I bet you his mother and sister just kept raving about Heath Ledger's performance and Christian 
[02:24:30]  Did you just say that?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, because I was looking for info.  It's good to know I think like you.  He's nervous about his shoulder appointment.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I bet you Christian Bale is snapping because everyone is talking about Heath Ledger.  Even his mom insists that he finally had it.  Because no one is saying, wow, Christian Bale was great as Batman in this movie.  It's Heath Ledger's movie, like we've been saying for over a week.  And I'll bet you that fucking he caught them mocking his Batman voice like his mother and  sister would.  I'm Batman.  And he just couldn't take it.  Hey, what do you want for supper, Christian? 
[02:25:00]  I'll have a cup of overacting.  Right.  His mother and sister reportedly complained that the 34-year-old actor assaulted them at  a West London hotel on Sunday.  Britain's Press Association said they made the allegation at a police station in South, blah,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, the Scotland Yard.  It said the question was expected Tuesday.  When asked Tuesday about the news report, Scotland Yard said it was investigated in an  allegation referred to it by another police officer.  But the update is he's now been arrested for assaulting his mom and sister. 
[02:25:30]  Holy shit.  Do we know why?  No, everything.  So far, everything.  I hate those reports like that.  And don't put it out until they have the full story.  Give me more info.  Right now, everything I see, it's still, they're still referring to it as like,  the alleged incident.  Like, there's nothing concrete out there.  Yeah, it's alleged.  So Sharpton has to pay millions in back taxes.  Good.  Good fucking silverback.  So I...  Whoa!  So fucking...  That was Nick DiPaolo.  I didn't say that.  That was a Robert Kelly thingy. 
[02:26:00]  Didn't he say that?  So fucking...  No, see, now we have to protect ourselves.  Look, I don't...  I...  You should just be able to say whatever the hell you want on the radio,  but you just gotta acknowledge, look, we're just trying to make jokes so we'll last.  What, even on XM you can't do this shit?  Dude, there's fucking bloggers out there just waiting for us to fuck up.  Trust me.  Yeah, no, the whole...  Like I said, fucking 15 years ago when the internet came out,  it's the fucking worst thing that ever happened to the world.  Well, except unless you want to get porn really quick.  I mean, you should see the things...  Well, that's one of the times I did forget about that.  That's a good point. 
[02:26:30]  All right.  Moving on.  Scott Rigsby, I want to go back to you because the reason you're in New York,  you ran in that triathlon.  Yeah, the New York City triathlon.  Do they call it running in a triathlon, even though it's...  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, swimming, biking, and running, yeah.  And we had a guy die.  Yeah, I just heard about it, yeah.  He was in the Hudson River, and he said that...  He said.  He's not saying anything.  Yeah.  They're saying that he probably got stung by some of those jellyfish.  You see any of those jellyfish when you were swimming?  I didn't get stung by them, but when I was practicing in Hawaii, 
[02:27:00]  I get stung by one, and it's...  Oh, they're not fun.  No, not at all, but some people can actually die from them  if they have a reaction.  Right.  Did you know that someone was dying in this race?  No.  No clue until last year?  You know, there's 3,000 people in the race,  and they start the waves at 5.50 in the morning.  Right.  So, I mean, you know, it's just a mass...  What do you mean the waves?  Not everyone goes at the same time?  No, no, no, no.  It's not a mass start for this race.  It goes by pro males, pro females, and then they do age group. 
[02:27:30]  Right.  You don't want some slowpoke messing you up  as you're trying to, like, you know, swim and crap.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, yeah, this guy ended up dying.  They did an autopsy, and they don't know why he died.  No.  I mean...  They were thinking it might have been, like,  him, he got stung by a jellyfish,  which caused a cardiac arrest, but...  Yeah.  They already did an autopsy on him?  Yeah.  And they don't know?  They're doing one.  They have no idea.  They don't know anything right now.  He can cause respiratory problems  if you're deathly allergic to, like, a jellyfish sting.  Hmm. 
[02:28:00]  But that was, I mean, actually in Florida,  they've had, at the half Ironman competition down there,  they had somebody die back in May when I was there.  Right.  Yeah.  So, you know, I mean, it's not as, you know,  a rare occurrence as, you know,  they've had a couple people die within the past year.  Well, I can't imagine...  In the swim portion of the race.  I can't imagine this whole triathlon thing  is good on the heart.  Uh, it's tough.  It can tax the heart, yeah.  I do believe, yeah.  Yeah.  One of my buddies is the, uh, 
[02:28:30]  Andy Ball in The Bachelor.  The dude lost his cookies after the race.  You know, he puked.  I heard Dick Cheney's gonna do one next year.  Yeah.  The mini, mini, mini, mini triathlon.  But Dick Cheney...  He swam through two miles of oil.  Right.  My heart's fucking hurt.  Uh, I think we have the, uh,  news story on the triathlon.  Triathlete dying here in New York City over the weekend.  Let's, uh, see if this...  He did not have the right frame of mind, you know?  He did, uh...  Yes. 
[02:29:00]  Heat caused troubles for competitors  in today's New York City triathlon.  Several athletes were taken to hospitals  for heat-related illnesses,  and one man died,  though it is not known  if the heat had anything to do with his death.  Yeah, Carolina, it's supposed to be an opportunity  for athletes to challenge themselves  and compete against some of the best triathletes in the world.  But this morning, tragedy out here on the Hudson River.  A 32-year-old man died  just a few meters into the 32-mile course.  The course's organizer, Bill Burke, 
[02:29:30]  tells News 4 New York this morning's heat and humidity  made it a challenge for athletes  as well as the swarms of jellyfish.  But still no word yet how this athlete died.  Burke says the water temperature  was about 72 degrees around 7.30 this morning  when the 32-year-old athlete was in the water.  He says he was wearing a wetsuit  just a few meters away  from completing the swim portion  when the athlete went under.  Others stopped and signaled over to the rescue boats  that the swimmer was in distress.  Trained medics performed CPR in the water, 
[02:30:00]  but he died.  As of now, we don't know the name of the man  because his family in Argentina  has not been notified.  In Argentina.  Well, you just narrowed that down.  Probably a heart attack.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Well, it can happen.  They're putting a positive spin on this whole thing.  Peter Ashley's probably finished  a little more than three quarters of the swim course.  So he was somewhere between 1,200 and 1,300 meters  into the swim.  The swim is 1,500 meters.  The city had covered a good portion of it already. 
[02:30:30]  When other swimmers noticed that he wasn't moving,  they signaled to the rescue boats,  the fire rescue boats right in the area.  That this gentleman was obviously in distress.  Now, we're not...  Right now, it's not known how long this athlete  was in the water before help arrived.  Autopsy will be performed this Monday.  Now, four other athletes were treated  for heat-related illnesses.  This is the first death in the triathlon's  eight-year history here in the city.  All right, there you go.  Positive spin.  First death in eight years.  That's not bad.  The odds are good, right? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Count me in for the next one.  Guys, we got some breaking news here.  What, Jimmy?  Which, um...  It's amazing.  What happened?  Charles Van Duren is finally talking.  The guy, he was in the most...  Who is Van Duren?  The guy from Quiz Show.  Yeah.  Who gives a shit?  Jesus Christ.  50 years later, he's...  Oh, fuck.  He's finally telling everyone how he cheated 
[02:31:30]  and all that crap.  Yeah, we don't care.  The inside story.  Jesus Christ.  They made the movie back in 94.  And he wouldn't talk then.  Right.  And now he's finally like,  okay, no one's paying attention to me anymore.  I'll finally talk.  How about this?  We want to know about the Kennedy assassination,  9-11 mistakes that were made.  We don't give a shit about you  on your fucking faggy quiz show.  No one cares.  Don't we get a quote from Bob Barker next?  Fucking models half his age.  What is he saying about this whole thing?  He doesn't go in.  He just said they fed him answers.  It's the same shit we knew already  since he said it in 1959 
[02:32:00]  and then never talked about it again.  Go fuck yourself, Charles.  No one cares.  Just die already.  It's too late.  We've moved on to other things.  Why do I hate him?  I don't know.  I heard Gene Rayburn was a flounderer.  By the way, that triathlete died doing what he loves,  so that's good.  What's that?  Sucking in salt water?  Thank you, Nick.  I always hated that.  Yeah, I hated that.  He died.  No, if you ask the guy,  I don't think he died.  Yeah.  Always find out.  Always find out before you go to a funeral,  because I showed up at my buddy's uncle's funeral, 
[02:32:30]  and I didn't know what, you know,  I said, well, he died, you know,  doing what he loved.  And they go, he's hit by a bus.  And then you tried to save it.  He loved buses.  Yeah, exactly.  I go, what do you mean?  He was into the extreme games, wasn't he?  I don't think the triathlete is sitting there going,  well, at least I'm going to die, you know,  in the middle of what I love doing,  which is triathlons.  No, I don't think that's what he was thinking at all.  Yeah, it doesn't matter if you're doing what you love  or you hate.  Right.  Yeah.  Unless you're eating a girl's ass,  and your heart just stops.  Then you die doing what you love doing. 
[02:33:00]  What happened?  He was jerking off on Craigslist,  and his head blew off.  Yeah.  He went out doing what he loved.  Scott, do you eat ass or what?  Not before noontime.  Would he get right in there if it's nice and clean or what?  I actually...  Don't say that to this kid.  Look at him.  He's a decent fella.  No.  He's from the South.  He's a polite fella.  I'm a decent fella.  Yeah, but I've been studying him.  This guy has an edge to him, you know.  I was going to tell you the funny story about...  You guys would like this, about the Hawaiian Ironman. 
[02:33:30]  It definitely was a first.  I had this girl approach me the day before the Ironman,  and she said,  I'm going to really be cheering for you tomorrow.  And I said, that's great, or whatever.  Met her.  And then the next day, I didn't see her,  but I finished the bike portion of the race,  got on the run, two miles on the run,  and I'm running with one of my buddies from Atlanta,  and all of a sudden, this girl jumps out onto the course,  and there's like, you know, 20,000, 30,000 people there,  and she lifts up her shirt. 
[02:34:00]  Nice.  Now, I'm sponsored by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons,  so I'm thinking,  these guys put this up to, like, motivate me in the race.  And she actually had my name, Scott Rigsby, written...  Fucking Tara Reid.  What a whore.  ...right above it.  And so I was thinking,  oh my gosh, and this guy behind me goes,  I can't believe that just happened.  And I'm like, dude, I think I'm seeing things.  I'm so tired.  So go to mile five on the run.  Same thing happened,  but the girl comes running and gives me the running flash  and says, hey, I'll see you at the finish line. 
[02:34:30]  Never saw her.  And then I told my training partner,  I said, hey, man, you wouldn't believe this.  This girl flashed me after the race.  He goes, oh, yeah, the crazy girl came into the transition area,  and she said, hey, where's Scott Rigsby?  And I said, and he goes, why do you want to know?  And so she flashes him, and he says,  you know, you misspelled his name when she put her shirt back down.  So she goes up like this.  He goes, oh, get out of here, you crazy girl.  So he got flashed twice.  So wait, so your cock blocker friend sent the chick away? 
[02:35:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  He said, well, he sent her away because it was,  that was like the transition area,  and that's where we, you know,  she wasn't even supposed to be in there.  She was kind of like a stalker.  Well, she was showing her tits,  so it's like, I mean, that trumps any backstage pass.  Give a pass, here's your tits.  All right, no pass needed.  Come on back.  You do all right with the ladies there, Scott?  I do all right with the ladies.  They, you know, when I first had the accident,  you know, one of the things you think about  when you're 18 and going off to college,  you think, wow, man, this is just really gonna, 
[02:35:30]  you know, hurt things with the ladies,  but they don't care.  You know, I mean, they react to, you know,  my legs the way I react to, you know,  the way I come across.  You know, they could care less.  Right.  But women look at things differently than guys do.  It's a whole big piece of my act  how men and women are different.  But a woman, like a guy would look at a woman  with no legs and a lot,  but a woman would look at it like,  wow, this guy's a fucking,  has made it through this awful thing.  Let me fuck him.  A guy would look at a woman with no legs 
[02:36:00]  and go, how do I get her on a sailing fan?  That is true.  How do I hide these because she can't leave?  That's actually a good angle to take.  That's my ratchet set.  All right, we got to go backwards.  Remember we were talking about Batman?  Yes.  Pretty much everybody saw Batman this past weekend.  Well, what's it about?  I'm Batman.  The Dark Knight.  It's a guy who just, he arrested Joker for,  I almost did a beating his wife and sister joke,  and I'm like, why?  Is it true now Larry King played the Riddler? 
[02:36:30]  Nothing.  Hello!  Listen to what this guy did to go see Dark Knight.  Police say the temptation of Batman  was just too much for a child's father to pass up.  But while David Farnham was enjoying the dark night,  his young son was battling to stay alive.  Farnham's accused of leaving his two-year-old son  inside a car all by himself.  But that's when Janica Nielsen and her father saw the child.  We were walking to my dad's vehicle, 
[02:37:00]  and we see a baby in the back of the car.  I thought it was a doll at first.  I couldn't believe someone would leave their child unattended.  It was about 1.30 in the morning,  and so they stayed with the child while police were called.  The doors were locked, the windows were rolled up,  but we were able to get the child out of the car.  I got the baby out, and he was soaking in sweat,  so completely dehydrated.  His diaper was wet.  He was crying.  What the fuck, man?  But the fucking, did he get to see the movie? 
[02:37:30]  Right.  The fucking Heath Ledger was good.  Yeah, let's at least get the guy's review of the movie  and Heath Ledger's performance.  Kyle, what are you thinking when you leave a fucking baby,  especially for a 2 hour and 40 minute...  You're thinking about yourself.  That's par for the cause for this country,  fucking nitwitville.  I'm at it.  And that's why there's no God.  There is no...  Thank you very much.  There is no fucking God.  These are the stories that come out,  and I go, there can't possibly be a God.  It can't be. 
[02:38:00]  Because there's loving couples out there  that can't get pregnant,  and then you've got these schmucks having kids  and not taking care of them.  That proves there's no God.  Thank you.  No, honest to God, I really fucking feel that way.  The baby lived.  Let's get the same after the story.  I'm trying to prove there's a God  because the baby lives.  All this time, police say  Arnhem was inside the movie  watching the Caped Crusader.  He wanted to see a movie.  Do they have to use the Caped Crusader?  Quite crime in Gotham.  All his own, baby.  Right.  The Caped Crusader. 
[02:38:30]  He wanted to see a movie, apparently.  Apparently?  Maybe he didn't think that  leaving the child in the car was that bad,  but it's certainly very, very bad.  Are you trying to justify his behavior?  While the child remained in the dark  for nearly two hours,  police say temperatures inside the car  climbed to 86 degrees,  a dangerous point for the child.  86 isn't dangerous.  That's not that bad.  What the fuck?  Let's get a contest going.  Oh, he was a baby.  Let's get a contest going.  86 isn't dangerous.  86?  I was 86 in my bedroom last night.  Exactly.  What the fuck?  I didn't shit in my pants. 
[02:39:00]  The little baby was sweaty.  He had no water.  My parents didn't believe in AC growing up.  Trust me.  We got way above 86 when we were sleeping.  Do you know how many times  it was fucking one in the morning  and it was hot in my stupid house  and I would get up and put the AC up a little  and chisel her mother  with fucking fruit bat ears  would wake up  and go and turn it off?  That was the worst part about growing up  is I was still with the air conditioning bill.  Yeah.  I was like,  Ma, it's fucking air conditioning.  It's not blowing, you know,  fucking plutonium out through the vents. 
[02:39:30]  It's hot.  Why didn't you even have it then?  I don't know.  We had central air.  I couldn't sleep.  Plutonium.  And it would just go  and fucking, sure enough,  fucking  right out the front.  You've never seen a woman get up faster.  It was like she had her clit  tied to the fucking thing  and I would switch it.  It would pull her hood.  She had a little fishing hook  in her clit hood.  Only he could fucking  reference a clit  in an air conditioning story.  And my mom.  Yeah.  Don't forget I threw that in the mix.  His mother's clit  in the central AC.  Yeah, where the fish  was hooked through the hood  and when you put 
[02:40:00]  the air conditioning thing  that would tug just hard enough  and mother would know  she had a bite.  Jesus fucking.  It's like trolling for blues.  Old penny pincher.  She's got great ears.  You can hear that thing going on.  Although my electricity bill  $500 this month.  I never noticed my electricity bill.  What?  $500 fucking dollars.  What?  How much should it be?  It's usually around  $380 or something.  Sure.  But I did hear on the news  everybody's is up like  $120, you know.  What the fuck's?  $500?  What the fuck?  Let's get the rest of the story.  I like a lot of AC though.  I'm going to start selling 
[02:40:30]  coke to kids again.  Back to the kid  dying in a car.  Climb to 86 degrees.  A dangerous point  for the child.  I was incredibly angry.  I mean it's just  it's selfish.  It's irresponsible  and selfish.  One of those stories  is hard to believe.  I want to point out  how we reacted.  At first we're like  that fucking guy  what an asshole.  And now we're mad  that they're saying  86 was bad.  We're like  fuck that kid. 
[02:41:00]  86 is nothing.  But the point is  leaving your kid in a car  to go to a fucking moron.  You fucking cock  sucking moron you.  One of those stories  hard to believe  if you're a parent.  Now Nielsen says  they couldn't find  a father inside  the movie house  so they along  with the police  waited until Farnham  came out  and that's when  he was arrested.  What an asshole.  Arrested him huh?  How would they find him?  He did get to watch  the whole movie  to answer your question.  He did get to enjoy  the whole movie.  Did he see the whole thing?  What the fuck?  Did he really?  What they don't?  Seriously?  They can't even do 
[02:41:30]  the right thing  and stop the fucking movie  and go dude  whoever has their fucking  kid in the car  I'm sorry  but you're going to  have to leave right now.  They didn't want to  interrupt the other patrons.  Oh my goodness.  See how stupid we are?  Well the person  who has a blue son  is that?  Well that's  the dark knight  is more important  than the kid.  That's what we learned today.  Right?  Yeah.  I think the police  tried to say something  but they kept getting  shushed by the usher.  Shush shush shush.  Not everybody  should have kids.  Hey uh  Did I tell you  that my mother  shouldn't have had kids 
[02:42:00]  if she didn't want  to use the air conditioning?  How about you fan me  with your big giant tits?  I'm just being inappropriate.  They're shocked  on the bleachers today.  They're like  why is Jimmy  making fun of his  lovely library  and mother  My mother's great  but she was awful  but she would get up there  and I would  I would just hear  the air turn off  and the rage  would build on me  and I would get up  and go  why are you doing that?  It's hot!  Yeah.  She'd be like  open the window  like what do you think  the fucking  it's not snowing out mom 
[02:42:30]  it's August  and then she threatened  to throw me out of the house  until I was 26.  Hey you survived  another four years though.  I sure did.  You made it to 30  with mommy and daddy.  Hey uh  open a window.  It is two for Tuesday  so we have another story  of a kid being left in the car.  Look at what we do.  Two, two, two stories.  This guy was seeing  Porky's three.  This is even  believe it or not  we got a story  that's even worse  than what you just heard.  What was it  88 degrees in the car?  Is the kid driving?  A baby? 
[02:43:00]  A four year old boy is dead.  His mother left him  in her car  while she went  into a nail salon.  All of this  on what was supposed  to be her wedding day.  Wow.  Dumb cunt.  Dumb cunt.  Her wedding day  she wanted to get  her nails done  she left a four year old  in a car.  How long did it take?  How many fucking fingers  did she have?  300?  I don't know  what the fuck goes on  in those nail salons  but they take way too long.  to get their nails done  she's way too fucking long. 
[02:43:30]  Why does it take  an hour and a half?  What are you doing in there?  How long is she in there for?  I don't know.  Because it's about her.  All of this  on what was supposed  to be her wedding day.  Marcy Gonzalez  has more  from West Palm Beach.  See what exciting  for her wedding.  You know?  See what happy.  A happy bride to be  spent the morning  in this.  That's a Korean  nail girl.  No doubt, right?  Her toe jam  I'm very dirty.  Take six hours.  Fucking baby roast 
[02:44:00]  like potato.  See what happy.  A happy bride to be  spent the morning  in this nail salon.  What are you yelling at?  Hit.  After a pedicure,  manicure and facial,  the woman walked out  to her SUV  ready to go  to her wedding.  Fucking heart  is screaming  outside.  The mother's  heartbreaking screams  brought store owners  rushing outside.  My baby  has passed away  in the car.  Her four-year-old  son's nearly  lifeless body  was inside the vehicle.  What did she think  was going to happen?  She wanted it to happen. 
[02:44:30]  I'm telling you.  Half this shit  ain't accidents.  I'm fucking telling you.  People are that selfish  in this fucking world.  Especially a bitch  who spends two hours  getting her fucking nails  done on her fucking wife.  She didn't want  that fucking kid.  Seriously.  But,  nobody's that stupid.  There's no fucking way.  Now she'll get  conjugal visits  at the prison.  I hope she gets  a nice lump  in her armpit.  We're all missing this.  How did the wedding go?  Was the reception  dampened by the news?  Did people go,  you know what,  let's have a good time.  You're like,  we already got the flowers.  Fuck it. 
[02:45:00]  Let's do the...  I bet you they take it  down a notch  and they don't do  the chicken dance  out of respect.  But everything else  is a go.  The reception  and the husband  still wiped  the cake on her face  and she went,  are you fucking shitting me?  They're doing  the electric slide.  That's the way  in the car.  Her four-year-old son's  nearly lifeless body  was inside the vehicle.  He was in cardiac arrest  after spending  almost three hours  trapped inside  a sweltering vehicle  on a 90-degree day. 
[02:45:30]  She opened the car  and she tried to,  you know,  CPL,  wake up,  wake up.  She was screaming.  The both are trying to  bring him back.  I'm telling you,  I'm telling you.  What are you thinking?  I'm with Nick on this.  I'm telling you,  you can't be,  no one's that stupid.  There's no way  you shut the fucking car doors,  look at the car  with a kid in it  and forget.  You just,  steep down,  she wants,  she don't want  a fucking kid,  I'm telling you.  You want to have a kid  and then you realize,  what the fuck,  this sucks.  What did I get into?  God damn right.  And then you start thinking, 
[02:46:00]  all right,  there's ways I could get rid  of this kid  without being charged.  Why on the wedding day,  though?  Why on the wedding day  people take back the gifts?  That way even looks more  like she had a lot  on her mind.  Right, right.  Well,  the Vulture reporter  tried to talk  to the wedding party  and they were still  formally dressed  for the wedding.  Oh, good,  did he break the news?  Good.  Paramedics tried  to save the boy,  rushing him here  to Palms West Hospital  where he was...  By the way,  Tim H. from Columbus, Ohio  makes a very good point  on instant feedback.  The four-year-old 
[02:46:30]  died doing what he loved.  Banging,  danging on the windows  while sweating profusely.  Oh, ma'am.  While waiting for Cunto  to get her fucking fingers fixed.  El Cunto.  Jesus Christ.  This kid had the same  kind of mother I did.  I bet if he had turned  the air conditioner on,  she would have run out  and shut it off.  Now, that's what I call  a late-term abortion,  my friends.  Oh, God.  What the fuck?  Paramedics tried  to save the boy,  rushing him here  to Palms West Hospital  where he was pronounced dead.  What was supposed to be  one of the happiest days 
[02:47:00]  of a woman's life...  turning into one of the worst?  When she arrived  at the hospital,  she thought that perhaps  there was still a chance  that the boy was going  to live or survive.  When she discovered  that the boy had passed,  she went into  an emotional breakdown.  Back at the nail salon,  disbelief.  I just...  I can't imagine  someone leaving a child  in a car.  Really?  Wow, Nick is really  fired up on this one.  It fucking is inexcusable.  This bitch should be  taken out and shot  in the fucking...  right in front  of the wedding party.  Four years old, though.  Most four-year-olds 
[02:47:30]  know their way  around a car, no?  I don't know, man.  Oh, come on.  You think we're  blaming the kid now, really?  Yes, he's lazy!  Fuck this.  This broad should be  fucking beheaded.  Yeah, but...  She probably had  child locks in the back.  He couldn't get out.  What a dumb fucking whore.  But you're not  in a car seat at four.  I mean, you're...  You're sitting  in a seat at four.  Why wouldn't she  bring him inside?  She couldn't get out.  Because she wanted him dead.  That's why.  Because four-year-olds  are noisy.  They really are loud.  They're loud.  What a fuck?  And they can't  sit still.  They have to, like, 
[02:48:00]  play with every single  fucking thing they see.  No, but that was  probably her mentality.  That was her experience  for the past year,  what you're talking about.  Yeah, she said,  I don't want to deal  with this.  I got a new husband  that's banging me good.  Did...  Right?  That's what she said.  You're a gentle  of color.  But didn't the fucking  broad drown their kids  in a tub?  Another one put them  in a stage wagon,  drove them into a lake.  This is just a sneaky  way of doing that. 
[02:48:30]  I don't give a shit.  Yeah, I...  You're...  I'm telling you,  it was no fucking accident.  Nobody's that stupid.  You're onto something.  Let's get to the wedding party.  But investigators say  the mother may not  have known her son  was in the vehicle.  They think he could have  climbed in earlier  in the morning  without anyone noticing.  Fucking liar!  You're very sad.  You're very sad.  The woman now answering  questions from detectives  about her son's death  instead of saying,  I do.  I spoke with the family  today outside of the hospital.  That's a lawyer.  They were all dressed,  ready for the wedding,  too upset to explain  what went wrong. 
[02:49:00]  Investigators tell me  it's too soon to know  if the mother  will face any charges.  What the fuck?  Really?  If it was a guy,  he'd be facing charges  automatically.  I fucking guarantee it.  This fucking reporter.  Too upset.  He didn't know  the kid was in the car.  Why would you need  their comments about this?  Well, two things.  One thing is that  if the lawyer's trying to say,  well, maybe the kid  climbed into the car,  well, how come he couldn't  climb the fuck out of the car?  Thank you.  And second of all,  this fucking cunt reporter,  how dare you go up to,  you know,  they're still dressed 
[02:49:30]  for the wedding,  and she wants to get,  like, she wants to get,  she wants to know  what's the haps  with the dead kid.  Right.  Yeah.  What's the haps?  Jesus, just have some tax.  It's like Greta Van Susteren.  You think you're in the wedding,  well, I imagine you're  in the wedding party  and everyone's just  standing around  and you just kind of  look at everyone else  dressed like yourself  and you're thinking,  awkward.  Great.  I fucking try to think  you can get the money  back on the tux.  Right, exactly.  But that is a typical reporter,  a typical vulture  who would go to these people  still dressed, 
[02:50:00]  it's like,  what do you expect them  to say,  you fucking cunt?  What kind of news  are you going to get?  The kid is dead,  they're going to be miserable,  you're looking to have  screaming people on camera.  They're just looking  for the shot of somebody crying  to make the story even better.  But already, though,  but just that angle,  that, oh, the kid,  not only kid was in the car,  is that fucking angle,  that lawyer fucking statement.  They can interview anybody  and they're going to get  what they would have got  from the wedding party  I'm completely shocked,  I can't believe,  I knew her,  I didn't think that she's  somebody who would do  something like that,  she seemed to be  a very responsible person. 
[02:50:30]  Why do you need to upset  the family further?  Because they're fucking  scumbags and vultures,  and that's why it is great  when they get the fucking  punched in the face,  when people attack the media,  and it's amazing  how self-righteous they got  when ONA fans  were running up  and screaming in their faces  like they're doing  important work,  you fucking vultures.  You're going to a dead  kid's family  at a wedding party  and sticking a mic  in their face.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  And then she's saying,  hey, it's one of the  worst days of their life.  Really?  Like, what's worse?  When she had 1,500  on fucking Norwood 
[02:51:00]  to make the extra  fuck at the field goal?  You shit,  you shit twat.  I'd like to shit  right in her vagina  and then squirt it in  with a boot.  She lost a parakeet.  She lost a parakeet.  Buffalo Bills  Super Bowl.  I did.  I'd tie them all in.  Nails, dead kid,  air conditioning,  Buffalo Bills.  1986, I think.  Super Bowl joke?  I didn't know the kid  was in my car.  What were you driving?  A fucking Denali?  Dirty Ralph.  The cloth at the end  of that made me very happy.  I'm choking on my egg. 
[02:51:30]  Dirty Ralph's got a  what's the haps?  He writes,  what's the haps?  Is the honeymoon still on?  What's the haps?  The fucking reporter  I hate more than the mother.  Well, how about  looks like Greta Van Suster  in her show.  Talk about a show  built on...  That fucking thing?  That stroke victim face?  Greta is awful.  Oh, Jesus.  Were you really?  Yeah.  Yeah, he couldn't be  serious on that one.  No, but you know  why I said that?  My buddy Al Barber  goes, I think she's  kind of cute.  Yeah.  Are you fucking kidding me?  He's like a stroke victim.  Yeah, she's not attractive.  She's got like a hotline. 
[02:52:00]  Go ahead.  No, go ahead, Nick.  Jesus.  Nick is like...  Nice fucking 86 grain bread  with no butter on it.  Really fucking...  It's a little dry, isn't it?  Jesus Christ.  It's like Robert Bush's  Snatch-A-Meet-O-Bit.  Can I get more dust  with his toaster?  I eat that shit, too.  And without the butter,  it's not a treat.  All right.  ScottRigsby.com.  Yes, sir.  All right.  You want a broad?  We can get you a broad. 
[02:52:30]  There's plenty back in Atlanta.  They're good-looking.  Oh, are there ever, man.  Good Southern Bells.  Oh.  Good Southern Bells?  Good Southern Bells back in Atlanta.  Absolutely.  Hot Lana.  Do they lick balls in Atlanta or what?  Let's get down in the...  I have no idea.  I know the guys do.  I spent a week down there.  It's hard to find a girl.  I've only gotten hookers in Atlanta.  There was a girl I wanted to see down there  who had a really big clit  and big pussy lips,  but she lived too far away. 
[02:53:00]  It's true.  A couple years ago,  she was going to let me  bareback fuck her.  Have you been to the punchline?  Oh, yeah.  A few times, sure.  Probably a great place.  Yeah, it's great.  Great place.  He plays it a lot.  Next time, you should go see Jimmy.  I'm there in a few...  I'm here in about a month.  Oh, yeah.  It's a great place.  I like to have my asshole spit in.  You ever have a girl spit in your ass?  It's fucking wonderful.  Yeah, Scott.  I mean, come on.  By accident.  We can only talk about triathlons long enough.  Do you like that or what?  Jimmy's asking a listening question.  I like that.  Like, when you're on your hands and knees  and your fucking rear is up in the air  and they spit into it 
[02:53:30]  and they just slowly tug your dick.  You like that?  Oh, who doesn't?  Jimmy likes his dick pulled backwards.  Yeah, like...  Backwards.  Almost like they're going to pull it  and I'm going to go...  Take off.  Sounds painful.  Pulling your dick backwards.  Jesus Christ.  I do a little bit like a Manx cat tail.  But it's awful  because my stomach hangs down  and they're jerking me off  with my fat stomach hitting their knuckles.  It's really unsexy.  This is spitting your asshole, huh?  Yeah, it's really fucking nice. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Can you get footage of that?  I'd like to see that in slow motion.  I probably could, actually.  I'd love to have a fucking spy cam hooked up.  Hey, I'm going to put the audience  on the spot for a second.  Anybody have a question for Scott Rigsby  from ScottRigsby.com.  Double amputee  who completed the Hawaiian Iron Man trifle.  Who's the chick out there?  Hold on.  Can you get the mic on the girl, mister?  Oh, I didn't see the girl here.  I couldn't see from where I'm sitting.  Who's the girl here? 
[02:54:30]  Oh, my God.  They just want to watch.  They're scared.  This crowd is scared.  Oh, there's two girls.  That's okay.  Really?  Yeah, what's your name, miss?  Megan.  Hi, Megan.  How are you?  Great.  How are you?  Good.  Do you have a boyfriend?  Yeah, right here.  Okay, how about the other broad?  Other broad.  You got a boyfriend?  Yes, I do.  Where is he?  Husband.  Okay, you guys are together.  All right, listen.  Sorry.  Would either one of you...  Thanks for the effort.  Would either one of you 
[02:55:00]  bang Scott Rigsby  if you were single?  I don't know.  It's a hard question  because their boyfriends  are right there  and what's going to happen  is this.  The drive home  is going to be this.  So, you want to fuck  the athletes?  But you said you would have.  But no,  we were on the radio.  And these fucking  jealous guys  are going to wind up  thinking that  they want to fuck.  So the women can't say.  And then they're going to be  fucking kneeling by the bed  and they're going to get  their hair pulled.  Where were you today? 
[02:55:30]  And they're going to see  the movies.  They say,  what did you see?  Father of the bride.  Father of the bride.  The best slaps ever  was De Niro  and Raging Bull.  Fucking rhythmic.  She calls him  a fucking fat pig  selfish fool  and he bites his tongue  of a selfish fool  and he lines up the slaps  just for those  gimme hands.  Oh, sure.  I'm going to get  my fucking greasy hands up.  Hi, who's this?  That's Scott.  He might have a bottle  opener on his knee.  A Swiss army knife. 
[02:56:00]  Swiss army leg.  Hello?  Ah, she's gone.  Who was it?  Some broad  looking for Russell.  I thought we'd fuck  with her.  Russell?  Russell who?  Maybe I shouldn't have  said, hi, who's this?  Oh, yeah.  Because no one answers  their phone like that  at home.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Hi.  I should have said  hello.  Hi, you're on the air.  What, this is a residence?  It's open, kid.  Thank you, fella.  We're going to take  a quick break.  scottrigsby.com  nickdip, uh, nickdip, uh,  nickdip, uh, lennarigsby.com  I got a tinkle.  And so do I.  You're going to go 
[02:56:30]  in that tiger cage  and shit?  Daddy, daddy, daddy,  please, please,  please don't kill me, daddy.  I want, I want,  I want to live.  Why are you killing us?  Wow.  That bellyache, shut up.  You deserve to burn in hell.  Opie and Anthony.  We're back with  the Opie and Anthony show.  Got a full house today.  We got a nice crowd outside.  We got Nick DiPaolo 
[02:57:00]  from nickdip.com.  Scott Rigsby in studio.  A lot of questions for you, Scott.  We're going to go to the phones  in a second, but  Nick DiPaolo was telling us  about his trip to, uh,  Afghanistan, actually, right?  Yeah.  It was, well, you got,  you heard about  the whole fucking incident  about the mortar attack  and all that shit, right?  What's your take on that?  Well, I'm just glad  it's third world ragheads  shooting at us  because they have  no fucking aim  and apparently  they don't have the equipment,  but they were aiming  at the base that we were at.  So, you know what I mean?  And you were in a bunker  for a while?  Yeah, we were in a van  on a way to a meet and greet 
[02:57:30]  and all of a sudden  the sirens went off  so we had to pull over  and kind of jog to a bunk.  You know, I mean,  we felt better  because it was soldiers  who had been through it with us  and they weren't exactly panicked,  but, you know.  Were you scared a little bit?  I don't know.  I was, like, too tired.  I was up fucking  for, like, 24 hours.  I was too tired to be scared,  you know what I mean?  Yeah.  But, you know, a little bit.  It's a little creepy, you know?  And, yeah, it was fucking amazing.  So we're in this, you know,  cement bunker  for, like, 40 minutes  and already signing autographs  and shit.  In a bunker?  In a bunker. 
[02:58:00]  And, yeah,  it was fucking crazy.  We got to, like I said,  we got to fly  the Blackhawk helicopters.  Yeah, this is what Nick  was saying off mic.  He's got to talk about this,  but he was in a Blackhawk  and the guy said,  yeah, you want to shoot  a few rounds.  I can't imagine that's legal.  I don't know.  I hope I'm not getting  anybody in trouble.  I don't think so.  Just don't name names.  No, it was fucking great.  And then Nick goes,  you shoot women  and children?  Yeah, it was fucking amazing  to get behind that machine. 
[02:58:30]  Obviously, it's cool  when nobody's shooting back at you.  I kept it all in perspective.  Yeah.  But, uh...  You were firing at  a little hill or something?  Well, yeah, the guy said,  just fucking aim  at that hill over there,  which I did and shit.  And then, you know,  when we landed,  I saw him getting  a little talking to  from his superior.  Apparently, I shot  over a village.  So, uh...  Which wasn't my fault.  I shot when he told me  to shoot.  How did they know  you were even shooting?  Uh, how did who know?  Someone on the ground  was like, what the fuck?  There's some firing  going on here?  No, I mean,  I'm sure the pilot  knew, you know... 
[02:59:00]  It was the carnage of camels.  They know exactly  where they are.  And, uh...  What's going on.  Yeah, what's going on.  So, why the hell  would that guy  take the chance?  Maybe he was leaving  in a couple days.  Maybe he was just about done.  We all got to do it, though.  That's amazing.  I mean, it was fucking...  Like I said,  this footage...  How did that feel?  I didn't want to let go  of the fucking thing.  Seriously.  I mean, you're like  a 14-year-old kid  playing...  I mean, in a Blackhawk  whipping through the desert.  Right.  I mean, it was like...  I couldn't sleep that night.  I was so fucking excited.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  And we also got to sign  a 500-pound bomb  from one of those drones. 
[02:59:30]  Ralphie Mae was there?  Oh, motherfucker.  Poor guy's not even  here to defend himself.  I know, but I just  couldn't do that.  It's too good.  It's perfect.  And this video's on YouTube?  Yeah, it says  dude shooting machine gun.  Your dude?  Yeah.  It says dude shooting  machine gun.  That's me.  You fucking pull it up.  I think they're looking  for you.  But like Florentine did it.  You know, Artie did it.  Bubba Bowie did it.  It's going to be...  I'm sure...  And they all have  footage of themselves 
[03:00:00]  doing it,  so it's going to be  on their website,  so I'm not getting  anybody in trouble,  I don't think.  That's pretty cool, man.  But yeah, that was fucking...  And we got to sign  this 500-pound bomb  that those drones dropped.  You know, they got  a Predator and a Reaper.  The Reaper's the newest one.  And the next day,  they dropped it  and ate insurgents  planting an ID.  That's what the guys told it.  It was fucking crazy, man.  I mean, just...  And the guys loved it.  They ate it up.  We flew out  to the middle of nowhere.  Like, we were in Kandahar,  and we flew from there  on the Blackhawk  about a 45-minute  helicopter ride. 
[03:00:30]  Were you weaving?  Were they doing  some cool shit for you?  Yeah, they were flying...  I mean, to look at those...  Sideways and...  Yeah.  Wow.  The first, like,  10 minutes,  we're sitting there,  you know,  and we're whipping through.  All of a sudden,  they started shooting.  It scared the shit out of us  because we didn't know  if we were being shot at.  Oh, they were just  fucking around?  I don't know.  I guess.  I'm never going to  answer to that either.  They were showing off.  They're cowboys, man.  I would think so.  Did you get sick?  No.  The fucking thing...  They kept talking  before we got on.  You know,  there's even a few pilots  that I'm like,  oh, this is going to  make me sick.  The thing was  smoother than most 
[03:01:00]  flights I've taken.  Really?  Yeah.  I would be puking.  It's so cool, though.  They can hover, you know?  When you're waiting  to take off,  you hover like 30 feet  off the ground  for like five minutes  and then just...  And does it, like,  just shoot forward?  Yeah.  It's fucking amazing, man.  How high are you?  Like 500 feet?  They can't go too high  because they don't  have any targets.  Well, when we were  actually shooting  the machine guns,  we weren't that high.  Yeah.  I mean,  I remember what Artie was doing.  He was shooting  like an irrigation ditch  or something.  You could actually see  the bullets hitting the...  But, you know,  I don't know what the exact...  Once we were whipping  through and we weren't. 
[03:01:30]  But it was fucking...  You're in that helicopter,  you're all strapped in, right?  And there's wires  hanging and shit  and you're like,  there's no room  for error here.  If something...  Right.  You know what I mean?  And they actually go...  Before we get on,  the kids that are flying  are like 25 years old,  baby face.  Like, you remember  what a nut you were  in your 20s.  Yeah, no shit.  And they go,  if the thing goes down,  just stay in the copter.  But he goes,  and if you do that,  you might get burned  by searing oil  from the ceiling.  And they're giggling  and shit  and we're looking  at each other.  What the fuck?  We're going to die  in this...  I'd be out of my mind. 
[03:02:00]  But, you know,  it was to see  those mountains  and you'd fly  over the fucking desert  for 20 minutes,  see nothing,  and then you'd see  like a house  made of mud, right?  And you're like,  how?  What are they surviving on?  In the middle of the desert.  And then you'd see  a fucking acre  of green vegetables  and shit.  Right.  In the middle of nowhere  because they know  how to tap into  the water underneath.  It's fucking...  Are we accomplishing  anything over there?  Have you seen  any signs of  we're doing good?  What did you see?  Well, I mean... 
[03:02:30]  Afghanistan's a little  different than Iraq, though.  Yeah.  You know, right now  it's much more dangerous.  You know?  I mean, there were  more people killed  than them.  Yeah, I know.  It's getting bad again  over in Afghanistan.  I guess all the...  The numbers are going up  over there.  All the equipment's in Iraq,  you know,  and they want to  switch it over to...  But once I see  the technology  of these unmanned drones  and shit,  and this colonel  has shown us  how he can literally...  You know,  the unmanned drone  send a picture back  and he's watching  on his computer  like a couple insurgents  bearing an IED  at nighttime.  He saw that footage? 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  And he goes...  The thing is,  he can go home  to his home in Vegas  and actually blow people up  in Afghanistan  from his home in Vegas  and then go swim  in his pool.  So how will we even...  I don't even see  how it's even close.  How we could fucking  ever lose...  Right.  I don't fucking get it,  you know,  with that technology.  And the drone took off  during our show  and Kandahar took a picture  of us doing our show  from the...  That's fucking cool.  And they gave it to us  the next day.  Is that on NickDip?  Not yet.  I haven't had a time.  I had to go right to Montreal 
[03:03:30]  from there.  I haven't had fucking  two minutes to shit  in the last three weeks.  Right, right.  But it's all gonna be  on NickDip.com.  Absolutely.  That's cool.  Put the footage up  and it was very humbling  to see how these kids live  and what they've given up.  I mean,  Kandahar was a fucking nightmare.  It's like 120 degrees.  And they're living in tents.  They're living in...  Well, they have like barracks,  but they...  But there's no AC  or that shit.  There's...  But there was a sewage  treatment plant  like right in the middle  of the fucking base. 
[03:04:00]  So literally,  the shit smell was so bad.  And people told us  before we got there,  we were like,  they gotta be exaggerating.  You could literally taste it.  It was...  I was...  It was so thick.  I mean,  picture like somebody's  septic tank  backing up on a hot day.  It was 40 times worse than that.  Literally.  You got used to it a little bit  and every once in a while  the wind would shift.  They can't figure that shit out.  I don't understand...  I don't understand that.  I think as men  we'd figure that out quickly,  you'd imagine,  but they got other things  to worry about.  Yeah, exactly.  And they're accustomed. 
[03:04:30]  They like become acclimated to it.  I saw guys jogging  in the fucking afternoon.  I'm like,  are you fucking kidding?  Just sitting...  Get the lungs of Amy Winehouse  when you're done.  Yeah, exactly.  Just sitting around,  you're burning calories.  You don't need to go for a jog.  No, it's...  They tell you to drink  literally...  It was 12 quarts of water a day,  which is three gallons.  Right.  Just to stay hydrated.  Stay even.  Just to stay even.  They have a chart  over the urinals in there.  It shows you, you know,  different colors of your urine.  Right.  You know, if it's real yellow,  you're dehydrated. 
[03:05:00]  Sure.  It's like five different...  You know, it's all...  They have that posted  over every urine,  every urinal in the bathroom.  Three gallons a day.  Yeah.  Just to, like, stay...  It was amazing.  And to see, like,  chicks with machine guns.  Did you take long leaks at night?  Long leaks?  Yeah.  It's the weirdest thing.  Like, I went hiking  in the Grand Canyon.  I've talked about this a bunch  over the last few years.  Me and my brother.  And...  Because it's so fucking hot  and dry heat.  They...  Not the same thing  because they're fighting a war  and I'm fucking hiking  in a hole.  But they tell you 
[03:05:30]  at every turn,  make sure you stay hydrated.  And because it's so hot,  your body keeps  all the water inside  to keep your body temperature cool.  Right.  But then when you go back  to your room  and you got AC  and you're sleeping,  you wake up  and take these monsters...  Yeah.  They take forever leaks  and you're amazed  all this fluid is in you.  Yeah.  Because your core temperature  is finally, you know,  dropping.  And your body's saying,  all right,  I don't need this water anymore.  That's right.  That happens to me at home  more than it did over there.  Oh, really?  I don't think I was probably... 
[03:06:00]  I probably wasn't fully hydrated  over there, you know?  I mean, I wasn't drinking enough.  Yeah.  But that fucking happens  to me all the time.  All right.  Patrice is busting my balls  about me having to take  so many pisses.  You're a fucking old man.  It's like an Abathard commercial.  Stupid Patrice.  I was flying to L.A.  with him many years ago.  I caught kind of La La Land.  And we were going on...  I caught up a lot of coke.  Yeah, just, you know,  crazy stuff.  And we were on a TWA flight.  What about L.A.?  L.A.  Sorry.  Sorry.  One too many.  Yeah.  I'm known for that.  What happens? 
[03:06:30]  I really...  I'm going to eat my banana now.  All right.  All right.  But I got a lot of flight.  I pissed so many times.  Patrice told me to check for diabetes.  He's so obsessed with other people's urinary...  The urinary habits of white people.  Yeah.  He focuses on...  Well, he's hoping.  And he roots against this.  Yeah, he's hoping we get...  He roots against this.  He really is.  He's hoping that we have diabetes.  Yeah, he can't wait to get the good news.  Abso-fucking-lut.  That you tell him that you have diabetes just like he does.  When he told me he had diabetes, I asked him.  I go, well, if you're a black guy and you get diabetes,  how do you know when your feet start rotting? 
[03:07:00]  That's a joke by Nick DiPaolo.  Hey, well, we can't do that.  Patrice laughed his balls off.  I'm just...  He's one of my best friends and he's black  and I'm not a fucking racist, okay?  I'm with you, trust me.  No, I'm not saying it to you.  I'm saying it to whoever.  These don't be bloggers once again.  The Breitbart's out there.  Yeah, now fuck the bloggers.  They just jot, jot, jot, jot, jot, jot, jot.  Yeah, I know.  Fuck them, fuck them.  Are you a big man, Scott?  What are you packing?  Speaking of bloggers, huh?  I get home-owned.  That didn't get dragged. 
[03:07:30]  Why don't you pull up my clip of me shooting that gun?  No?  Yeah.  Nobody interested?  Fuck it.  No, we'll throw it up on the big screen.  Absolutely.  I'd like to see it on a big screen.  All right, we got Tom in Chicago, also known as Gotham City.  What's up, Tom?  Scott, how's it going, man?  Hey, brother.  How's it going, man?  What was your support structure as you were training starting in 2006?  And what, outside of being a double amputee, did you do to prepare for that?  And the second question is, did you ever consider using your prosthetics to host some advertising, 
[03:08:00]  and would you throw a wow sticker on each of them?  Hey, thank you.  Fuck it out.  I like that.  I like that.  I like that.  Yeah.  My support structure, I mean, a lot of people ask me, you know, how did your family react  to saying, hey, I'm going to do Iron Man?  First of all, they didn't even know what it was.  I'm the youngest of seven.  My parents have been married for, like, 63 years.  I have older parents.  They're 82 and 83 right now.  Wait, wait, wait.  You're not kidding?  You have parents that have been married for 63 years? 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what's the age range with everybody?  My oldest sister is 60, so there's 20 years difference.  I have four sisters, 60, 58, 56, 54, two older brothers in their 40s.  Wow.  Well, my oldest brother's, like, 50.  Wow.  And then I have a middle brother that's about four or five years older than I am.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  And so, you know, they asked what my, you know, kind of my support structure was, is 
[03:09:00]  my dad, you know, basically my mom was very supportive, but my dad, you know, when I had,  you know, really I was the first US double amputee, I don't know about world, to do an  Olympic distance triathlon like they did in New York this past weekend, and then the first  to ever do a half Ironman.  And so I asked my dad, Christmas time of, you know, 2006, I said, hey man, I said, you  know, I've done all this stuff, I've helped a lot of people, and you know, you never called 
[03:09:30]  me to, like, say anything about it.  He goes, and I said, well, are you not proud of me?  He goes, I'm not proud of you.  And because, you know, my dad is like from the old school, he's a guy, I came through  their impression, depression, and so he's like, you know, you need to get married, you  need to get a job, and all this kind of stuff, and he didn't really see the bigger picture.  So then I think I kind of get a little bit more props when I finished the Hawaiian Ironman,  and so he watched me on NBC, saw 50 million people see me cross the finish line, and I  said, hey, mom said you saw me watch you cross the finish line, and I said, what did you think 
[03:10:00]  about it?  He goes, I didn't think anything about it.  You know, so he said, you know, he's kind of like, you know, just, it's, he doesn't really  understand what's going on.  But, uh, that helps me relate to people who really have a dream and want to do great  things, but then they go, I've got to have people to support me.  Well, you really don't, you just have to get good people.  You have to have a dream, and you have to get good supportive people, so I've got good  friends.  But that's got to be disappointing that your dad's not impressed, man. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, absolutely, sure.  What the fuck?  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, sure it was.  But, you know, it's, it's, uh, you know.  You've been an inspiration for a lot of people out there.  Yeah.  But, you know, the fortunate thing is, I get a lot of press, but really, there's so  many people around me, you know, good guy friends, um, from high school, college, and  stuff like that, um, that really, I mean, I wouldn't be able to cross the finish line  if it wasn't for them and their support.  Are you angry at him for that?  Am I angry at my dad?  I'm getting annoyed listening to it, like. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, I'm so annoyed.  Like, I'm getting aggravated for you.  No, I mean, I think about, like, you know, if he was such a, if he's such a hard case,  think about his parents, he probably had, I mean, they were, you know, uh, they probably  worked doubly hard on him, so I want that kind of, uh, attitude to stop with my kids.  You know, when I, when I have kids, I want to be able to, you know, be very supportive  in whatever they want to do.  Where do you get your personality from?  Your mom, then, I'm assuming?  Yeah, I'm, I'm a lot, like, a lot, my mom. 
[03:11:30]  She's very, you know, kind of laid back, go with the flow, you know, um, and, uh, you  know, but a very hardworking woman, you know, Betsy.  What do you do for a living?  What do I do for a living?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's, I mean, I, I, I do public speaking engagements and, and, and pay the rent.  So you're making, you're making a good living with that.  Yeah, I mean, I pay the rent by, uh, you know, I've talked to Arby's and places like that.  I go do corporate gigs and, and then, um, I don't really pass up an opportunity.  I mean, I drove two hours to spend time with, uh, you know, 13 kids, uh, in this little 
[03:12:00]  small, uh, you know, school on a cross country team.  They wanted to invite me up there and just talk with them about running and stuff like  that.  So, uh, drive up there.  So I don't really, how old were they?  Uh, the, they're like middle schoolers and stuff.  Yeah.  That's Uncle Paul, by the way.  Uncle Paul really likes kids.  They're so inspirational.  Yeah.  You know, I gotta say it.  I mean, that's way cooler than having a job. 
[03:12:30]  Um, yeah.  Well, I mean, I'm in the middle of writing a book.  I don't, yeah.  Oh my God.  I want to trash your dad.  I don't even know him, but I'm getting really frustrated.  What exactly?  You're, is he jealous of the attention you get?  What?  Yeah.  I think that, I think that he came in a time, uh, you know, during the, during the like  great depression where, you know, you just, you work, you worked hard and you got  married, you had a bunch of kids.  You didn't, you didn't get anybody's business.  They didn't get in your business and you just kind of kept to yourself and, you know, 
[03:13:00]  you, in, in his own world.  And, and that really wasn't, uh, where I felt like, I felt like this, you know, accident  happened for a reason.  And that I'm supposed to be out there inspiring, you know, our military men and women to, to  overcome, you know, if they're injured to go overcome their, uh, challenges or just  able-bodied people motivate the couch potato, you know, to get active and just show people  what they can do.  You're absolutely inspiration.  Now, when you lost your, your one leg first, right, right leg below the knee first, yeah. 
[03:13:30]  And then finally in 98, you told him to take your left leg.  We, we talked about all this earlier, if people are just tuning in.  Yeah.  What, did he show any emotion when you lost your leg initially?  Oh yeah.  It was very emotional.  Yeah.  But what, what, that's probably the only time.  But he still wanted you to get a job?  Well, no, that's the only time that I've ever seen my dad, dad cry.  I mean, you know, and, and really, I, I guess I had the older I've gotten, I had a lot more  empathy for him, uh, because, uh, you know, to not be able to express your emotions, uh, like 
[03:14:00]  that, it's, it's gotta be difficult because you got all this stuff bottled up inside.  And, uh, so, I mean, I, I, I'm, I'm like my mother.  I kind of wear my emotions on my sleeve.  And so, um, you know, it's, it, you, it, you have to, you have to kind of get past that  or you end up being bitter.  Like people go, you know, like I noticed one of the guys said, you know, Hey, whatever happened  to the truck driver, um, you know, uh, well, that's the next question from Momo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which truck driver, your friend or the one who hit you? 
[03:14:30]  No, no, no.  Actually the, the 18 wheeler, that driver that passed us that ended up causing the accident  and I lost my legs.  I mean, that guy got a $55 fine.  And this was, you know, rural South Georgia.  So they didn't even drug test him or anything like that.  But I, uh, I didn't, you know, I haven't gone around, you know, I went through the normal  stage in the grieving where you're, you know, you're pissed off, you're depressed, you're  angry, and then you kind of get over it because the deal with it is what helped me get over  this is I had good friends.  And when I was kind of depressed or moping around, they didn't cut me any slack at all. 
[03:15:00]  They're like, no, we're not going to, we're not going to let you do, you know, uh, just,  uh, go be depressed or whatever.  Get over it.  We're not handling your legs.  We're not handling your walker.  We're not handling your wheelchair.  You do it yourself.  And so they really forced me to kind of be extremely independent.  They were very hard on me at the first, but you know, you can be mean at first and nice  later, but you can never be nice at first and then mean later. 
[03:15:30]  And that's really how, uh, you know, my, my support team was amazing.  So the trucker, you never spoke to him?  Yeah.  I never got a chance to talk with him.  Does he even know what he caused?  Oh yeah, sure.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, he has, I mean, you know, uh, kids even asked me, you know, Hey, if you  had a choice, you know, if you had this kind of divine choice to, uh, you know, get your  real legs back or live with prosthetics the rest of their life.  And they asked me, what would you do?  And I was like, hands down, it's an easy question.  I would go through my life with prosthetics exactly like I am now, then go back to just 
[03:16:00]  having just real legs because I can make a greater impact on the world by, uh, walking  around on prosthetics.  And you're so used to them by now.  Do you get more?  I mean, I've lived longer, you know, with prosthetics than I have without them.  Do you get more women now?  You know, it's, it's weird.  I mean, I'm, I am the, I have, it's, you know, I've never been married because I can go  into a bar and I can sit down and I have a woman will come up and she'll sit down and 
[03:16:30]  she will tell me every intimate detail in her life and actually then leave.  And, uh, you know, um, it's just, I just have this kind of personality that, uh, people  just, you know, they spill their guts to me and I think, you know, give them a good, you  know, sticking before they leave though.  Not so much.  Do you want me to jerk you off under the bar?  Do you poke them, do you poke them in the fart box before you tell them to beat us?  I'm in the ultimate, I am the ultimate, uh, friend zone kind of person.  And I think it has to do with something, you know, people see the prosthetics, they understand 
[03:17:00]  that there's a story behind there and that there's a trauma there and, and people relate  to pain.  They understand, uh, you know, about pain.  Do you dream, um, do you have dreams that, that you still have your legs or like, what are  your dreams like?  Is that like something that, that will come to you?  Like you're running or like, it was a really chilling moment in born on the 4th of July  when he had lost his legs and he dreamed of just getting up and just running and it was  fucking an awful, really chilling scene.  Do you, do your dreams like that? 
[03:17:30]  You know, I, um, I, I think right after the accident, well, I remember specifically right  after the accident, I played high school football, absolutely a fanatical college football  fan.  And I remembered playing with, it was interesting.  I remember playing with prosthetics, you know, and, and it was like, it was weird.  It was like, wow, why, why did I, why am I, um, dreaming that I have prosthetics?  But I think what happens in the deep subconscious is that you actually, that's when acceptance  happens.  You go, this, that, that was an old life. 
[03:18:00]  That chapter's closed and I've entered into this new chapter.  And, uh, and so that's when you really know that you kind of accepted it when it gets  into your dreams that, Hey, this is me and this is who I am.  Yeah.  Wow.  Very good.  Uh, Nick, your video is now up on nickdip.com.  Oh, is it?  That's what someone is saying.  And here's the video on YouTube.  Dude shooting a machine gun.  Dude shooting a machine gun on YouTube.  This is our, our friend, Nick DiPaolo.  That's you right there? 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  Holy shit.  What are you, you look insane.  I know.  You just don't lead him as much.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  You're really into it.  Yeah.  I wish you could see like the fucking ground to the back.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It was fucking crazy, man.  Or at least your face.  I bet you're just making crazy faces.  Well, you know, I'm lucky to even have that.  All the other guys had cameras and shit.  I went first.  They weren't sitting in the same section as me.  Right.  And I didn't even think to ask anybody to take a picture or anything.  Yeah.  And luckily the other gunner videotapes everything that goes on in the helicopter. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So I didn't even know.  I'm lucky to even, you know.  Do you, um, if they had said to you, you could, there's come some, you can shoot those  people down there that are possibly insurgents or they are insurgents, would you have done  it?  Why not?  That's a fucking lovely.  Yeah.  I wanted to answer, um, Brian's question, but I can't, I can't see it.  Oh, well, sure, Scott.  It's the Scott Rigsby show.  Uh, Brian the trucker.  Yeah, Brian.  I'm just a phone screener for the Scott Rigsby show. 
[03:19:30]  What's up, Brian?  Brian, you're on the air.  I'm here, but I'm on another phone also.  Oh, geez.  Let's not interrupt your day.  What do you got?  Prosthetic ears?  Stay back on hold.  Well, who are you on the phone with?  I'm on the phone with my company.  You're kidding, right?  You're on a live radio show in front of two countries.  Would I make it sound like truckers, what?  Scott makes it sound like all truckers do drugs.  But I've never said anything about drugs.  They do.  Actually, there was a truck. 
[03:20:00]  I hate this guy.  Not you, Scott.  This guy on the phone.  I'm on the phone with my company, and he's calling to defend truckers.  Shut up, you bunch of junkies.  Yeah.  You're a bunch of heroin addicts.  Yeah.  Scott said it, and I agree with it.  Interesting story about that.  And gay.  All truckers are gay.  Sorry, Scott.  Okay, a bunch of gay rest area blowjob fucking junkies.  Good, Scott.  Crystal meth.  Interesting thing about the truck drivers.  I never said that the truck drivers did drugs.  I don't know where that came from.  But anyway, there was actually...  But after what you went through, you would like to know if the guy was on drugs. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  No, I just said...  All I said was is that they didn't even drug...  It was 1986.  So, I mean, he didn't even get a breathalyzer or anything like that.  So, I don't know that the guy...  I don't have any heart or bitterness toward him.  Actually, there was an 18-wheeler driver behind him, and if it wasn't for that guy,  I might be dead because that guy had paramedic training.  Oh, no shit.  And was actually helping me out.  So, a truck driver caused the accident, and then another 18-wheeler driver helped save 
[03:21:00]  my life.  But like this guy...  Brian.  ...who's on the phone with his company.  Can you hear us?  I got rid of him.  Good.  I'm on the phone with my company.  Put me back on hold.  Yeah.  Shut up, druggie.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  He's probably calling to explain the fucking tainted piss results.  I'm sorry, Brian.  It's obvious that this 18-wheel driver had an extra cup of coffee or something.  That's right.  That's what caused this whole thing.  You druggie.  A bunch of druggies.  Another selfish asshole.  That's why everything's late.  All truckers are doing drugs.  Why don't you go home and let your kid out of the back of the car?  Let's go to Kevin in Texas. 
[03:21:30]  Is this another druggie trucker?  Yeah.  Gay druggie trucker?  Go ahead.  Ted.  What's your handle, goo gobbler?  Go ahead, gay...  How's it looking over your smokey?  How's it looking over your fucking donkey?  Stupid.  Yes, you're on the air, gay druggie trucker.  Yeah, gay druggie trucker.  What can we do for you?  Hello?  Kevin.  Yeah, what's your 20, HIV?  Hello?  Yeah, what's up there?  Let's go.  What's up there, good butty, B-U-T-T-Y? 
[03:22:00]  You're on the air, sir.  Hey, shit dick, let's go.  Hello?  Yeah.  Kevin!  Thanks for breaking that stereotype.  I don't hear somebody else's name.  No, it's you.  What's your name, druggie?  Mine's Kevin.  Oh, hi, Kevin.  Uh, no, they're like, no, I'm a truck driver.  I've been driving trucks for eight years, and I mean, yeah, there are a lot of drugs out  here available to truck drivers, but I mean, not as many as you think do them and everything.  Half the time nowadays, it's just inexperienced truck drivers.  Everybody's putting drivers out here, don't know what they're doing, and they get to all 
[03:22:30]  Bunky and the Bandit movies and crap like that.  I mean, that's absolutely true.  Yeah.  Driving home from Montreal, I get cut off like twice.  They're fucking, they're driving around a rotary like they're in a Toyota.  The fucking 18-wheeler with 60,000 pounds of potatoes, and I'm fucking, riding right  up my ass.  Jimmy, mass truck, Jimmy, mass trucker's all you want.  I still think you're funny.  I'm just kidding, dude.  Yeah, we're just fucking around.  Holy shit, now we have sensitive truck drivers in the country.  Fucking Oprah, somebody shoot her.  I'm saying every trucker, I'm saying every trucker is a gay druggie, and he thinks I'm 
[03:23:00]  really bashing truckers.  My dad was a trucker for many years.  He drove an 18-wheeler with a little thing put in the seat, you know, shaped like a penis,  but that was him.  Get it?  He used to sit on the emergency brake and spin.  Speaking of penises, now Greg has a problem.  Greg the trucker.  Oh, no.  Greg, what's the matter?  Greg.  Greg, hey.  Jimmy, I appreciate what you're saying.  All truckers are gay, man.  Oh, come on, man.  Maybe they're not all gay, but they're all willing to at least just hold your cock in  the mouth for a second. 
[03:23:30]  I mean, that's what a lot of lizards are for.  They're supposed to be the ones that get blowjob and stuff.  Well, that's not wrong with it, dude.  I mean, if you're helping out, if one trucker's helping another trucker out, just holding the  dick in the mouth and going, come on, are you done?  There's nothing gay about that.  All right.  All truckers aren't gay now.  Oh, get a hold of yourself, you homophobe.  But they do take it in the ass.  Why the fuck are truckers being sensitive?  Yeah.  That's because the time we're living in.  We're so feminized as a society.  You can't even fucking tease truckers. 
[03:24:00]  I'm telling you.  It's the time you're living in.  I'm well aware of it.  I really thought the truckers would be the ones that wouldn't be so fucking sensitive.  But who doesn't understand that I'm kidding?  We got Brian back who was on with his company and couldn't take our phone call, but he's  now ready to take our phone call.  Oh, cool.  Brian, I hope we didn't interrupt you with the company.  Hey, Brian.  Little Jimmy, happy birthday.  Get off my ass.  I was driving in downtown Miami on the phone with the company, man.  And any other time, y'all leave me on hold for an hour.  Oh, look, look, what?  What'd you have to tell the company?  All right.  Go ahead. 
[03:24:30]  The thing that upset me is this guy made a comment, you know, this truck driver that  hit him and caused the accident or whatever.  He said they didn't do no drug testing or nothing.  Any truck accident is DOT recordable.  It's by law they have to drug test.  That's in 86.  It was 1986.  I mean, but still.  And I wasn't saying that he had.  He wasn't listening.  It was a network.  Hey, how about we give.  Oh, my God.  He made a comment that all truck drivers do drugs.  I never said that, dude.  First of all, he did say that.  Yeah, Scott, you did say that.  I never said that. 
[03:25:00]  And he said they all like trannies.  Oh, he was talking about me.  Yeah.  I never said that, bro.  Did you?  First of all, I didn't say it.  And second of all, why don't we give him a break?  The guy has two missing fucking legs.  Yeah.  Thanks to the druggie truckers.  I was standing behind everything he said until he made that comment, you know, and they  didn't drug test.  He wanted the guy drug testing.  He was standing behind everything?  Is that a pun?  On drugs.  I think if you lost your legs, you would like to know why did this guy do this to me?  Was it drugs?  Was it too much coffee?  Was it him thinking about it? 
[03:25:30]  I was hit by a person doing drugs.  Did he go?  10 years old.  I'm hit by a car.  Hey, did you hear about the part, there was a truck driver behind the truck driver  who hit us that was actually a former paramedic.  So one truck driver caused the accident.  The other one saved my life.  Luckily, the one saved his life was doing coke.  Hey, did you get an idea of the part that there was another one going down on him?  He's very alert.  Well, you know what happened was that this one trucker was hauling 30,000 pounds of bananas  and he fell down a hill going to Scranton, Pennsylvania and he yelled, God, make it a dream. 
[03:26:00]  No one?  I'm giving it a hit.  Hey, Jimmy, would you shoot the insurgents?  People want to know.  I think I'd be able to.  I don't know.  Fuck, am I non-existent here?  Well, they were probably asking, could I ask you?  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  I'm very tired.  Go ahead.  Oh, did you ask too?  I asked Nick if he would have shot them.  Oh, I know that.  So that's why we wanted you to answer.  If they were, yeah, if they were in the process of burying an IED or something.  I don't know if I could.  I mean, I'm just saying, I'm not military.  I don't know how if I'd be able to do it.  Well, I don't know how it would. 
[03:26:30]  Well, I could have no fucking, you know me, I'm fucking, have no.  Did they tell you how they actually buried the bombs?  The IEDs?  Yeah.  They actually have a truck that comes through.  The guy was telling me.  Of course, a truck again.  Yeah.  And a guy driving his high.  Well, no, no, no.  It's actually, they cut the hole in the truck, and then one jumps out, digs the hole, and  then another truck comes in and plants the bomb, covers it up.  They now have kind of a, you know, a casino.  A one system.  Well, the casinos actually have this kind of eye in the sky. 
[03:27:00]  Right.  They actually have one of those that they stick on the plane now, and it can identify.  Well, yeah, no, we saw that.  Oh, really?  Yeah, those eye in the sky fins are on the bottom of the drone.  I met the defense contractor in California that actually made that.  Yeah, when I was right there.  Yeah, well, we actually went to the fucking, you know, to the garage where they were working  on the drones.  We saw the.  Exactly.  And we actually signed the 500-pound bomb, and the colonel was explaining to us they  have the technology where he can be in his house in Las Vegas and fucking blowing up  insurgents. 
[03:27:30]  I just got a crazy deja vu.  What the fuck?  You come from Bally's playing poker?  That's actually been a huge progress, and that's why we've been able to save a lot of  lives, just because of that technology.  Yes, absolutely.  Yeah.  It's phenomenal.  All they need to do is take care of that drug problem that they got over there.  Yeah, the poppies.  But, uh.  All right.  Uh, let's say hi to, well, let's go to Mongo the trucker.  Mongo!  You know, what's the problem, Jimmy? 
[03:28:00]  You suck one cock for an eight ball, and you're labeled for life.  Not necessarily.  You were just broke.  It wasn't an eight ball.  It was a tuna sandwich.  All right.  And someone is, uh, agreeing with you, they didn't, uh, drug test the, uh, the truckers  back then.  Of course they didn't.  They don't, they don't now.  They all cheat.  They're all driving with suspended licenses.  But they do drive like fucking maniacs today.  Mm-hmm.  It's, it's crazy.  They drive them like they're in a car, man.  The scariest are the, the ones that actually have the double trailer. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Those are the scariest.  Yeah.  Well, you should see.  Because that back one's doing this.  Oh, yeah.  I had, um, my grandmother would always yell whenever people would pass us, she would drive  her Ford Escort.  And it would, the catalytic converter would make it smell like farts.  And I would always go, are you farting?  And she would be very mad.  And whenever someone would pass her, she would yell, oh, speedy, skippy.  But really?  Yeah.  Well, hooray for me, the hell with you, huh?  That was what grandmother would yell.  I hope she passed.  Oh, she's dead.  Good.  All right.  I think we're heading toward line of the day. 
[03:29:00]  I think so.  Fuck.  Scott Riggs, uh, Riggs speedy was good today.  What's Obama lying about?  I mean, talking about.  Whoa.  Oh, Iraqi leaders want to take more responsibility.  Yeah.  Is he over there now?  So should you.  Yeah, he had to.  Listen, Jordan.  Uh.  He, um, he actually asked me to go, but I was like, yeah.  Fucking guy loves me.  Yeah?  Obama?  Yeah.  Likes my take on things.  No.  No. 
[03:29:30]  Hey, it's hot in here.  I'll say.  What the fuck?  Who's running the air conditioning?  Jimmy's grandmother?  Come on.  No, it was my mother.  She set up for the window.  My mother, I'm sorry.  It was my mother.  Fuck that one up.  No, it was my mother.  It's too early for comedy.  Um, yeah, he's over there.  All right.  I'm going to go home and pretend to write jokes.  Why don't we do line of the day?  All right.  Or at least start that process.  Uh, sponsored by Carbonite.com.  Oh, they're good.  Yeah?  Carbonite backs up your computer hard drive so you never have to worry about losing any of 
[03:30:00]  your files.  Check it out at Carbonite.com.  Yeah.  Provo code XM for some kind of deal, I guess.  Files.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  For lack of a better word, they're kind of like my idols.  Is that right?  Yeah, just from the science and the engineering standpoint.  I mean, it's brilliant stuff.  Why?  Did you go to school for engineer?  No.  I dropped out of high school.  Fan boy!  Danny with a runner-up line of the day.  Nice.  You like the Mythbusters today, huh?  That was a good one.  I love the Mythbusters.  It's probably... 
[03:30:30]  The one guy is such a bore.  The mustache guy?  He is a bore, but that kind of...  Who's the one that...  Which one's Penn?  It's Jamie.  Jamie.  Jamie has the personality?  No, no.  Adam's the personality.  Adam has the personality, right.  But, I mean, it's set up like...  I mean, it's...  They're nice guys, but...  Only one was going to come in yesterday, and we weren't sure if it was the boring one  or the good one, so we were, like, debating which one was coming in.  Yeah, but even...  You know what?  Even if it was just Jamie by himself, that probably would have been...  Jamie makes the show.  Hysterical in its own way.  Which one's Jamie?  The one that talked the most? 
[03:31:00]  No, no.  That's Adam.  Jamie's the guy.  All right.  I'm confused.  See?  The guy with a mustache is the one who didn't say shit.  He was the dream.  He's the weird, I'm from another time mustache guy.  Yeah, he didn't say anything.  Yeah.  He's kind of dry.  It's a myth that he has a personality.  The handlebar ones.  He had a thicker mustache.  Well, he...  I mean, I know way too much about this show.  A mustache old man.  But originally, Discovery Channel approached him singularly.  Oh, no kidding.  And he just said to them, he's like, I don't have the personality to do a show.  Well, then they didn't see that.  At least he knew.  At least he's... 
[03:31:30]  So they brought Adam along.  Yeah, which was like they worked together.  Yeah, they hooked him up with that firecracker.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  What's one about a shark that everybody thinks that's just not true?  Like, will they chase you on Landon into the street?  Only in a Warner Brothers cartoon.  Well, is there one that's not...  Boo!  There's one that is not...  The fucking boo. 
[03:32:00]  He felt good about that line, too.  My question, it sucked.  And his answer sucked even more.  His answer was the worst.  Oh, God, just silence.  Right.  Just awkwardness.  Even Danny couldn't bail it out.  And he loves them.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Put that way, before.  Yeah, that is...  Well, the book I have...  My ex-girlfriend, who did eventually leave me,  got me your book for Christmas last year.  Because I've been kind of obsessed with you for a long time.  She's got good taste.  Yeah, she really does.  She left me for a gentleman of color. 
[03:32:30]  It's a more offensive than saying, you know...  It's a pity of that.  It's cracking Scott out, man.  Well, he's from Georgia.  They love their shit.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, right.  Can we call your dad?  I don't like...  That's creeping me out, his legs over there.  I know, because there's two of them...  That's kind of creepy, Scott.  Yeah, sorry.  That is weird.  The one leg is crossing over the other leg.  It looks like the chair has, actually.  Yeah, it's bizarre. 
[03:33:00]  All right.  I can leave one, and can you take one of your legs out from the table and just replace it?  What legs are you going to be wearing later today?  I'm just going to use my walking legs, the one that I have on today.  How many sets of legs do you have?  You showed us the ones you got on.  Well, I've got the running legs.  You've got the spatula feet.  We call them the spatula feet.  Yeah.  The flippy...  Just those two.  Yeah.  And then the thing for the bike.  Yeah.  Okay.  Three sets.  Three sets.  All right. 
[03:33:30]  Let's go to another runner-up line of the day.  I had enough tightrope.  Enough about the rope.  We know the sky.  I think she got sick of looking the other way.  God.  He's getting another piggyback ride.  Good old Philippe.  They said my name wrong.  Yeah, we were disappointed with Philippe.  He's a hero to us, and now it's like...  He's just a fucking guy who walked on the wire.  Fuck him.  The French are very difficult.  He's an artistic fruit actor. 
[03:34:00]  I am an artist, yeah?  Well, then fucking paint a bowl of fruit and stay off the fucking...  Right.  He brought up juggling, too.  What's the obsession with fucking French people and juggling?  I don't know.  Yeah, they like it.  Put him on a fucking unicycle.  Paint his face.  I'm an artist.  Are you?  Exactly.  I don't see your shit in a louvre.  Yeah, he's an artist, and now he's juggling.  Yeah.  They go hand in hand.  They're going to hang a wire in a fucking museum?  No.  Stop being so cool and answer the question, why did you do it?  Yes, this is a stupid question.  No, it's not.  It's a stupid thing to walk across a fucking wire between two buildings and from the sidewalks. 
[03:34:30]  I love how we turn up people, because we just...  I am what I do.  Right.  Well, it's all bullshit.  What was his answer to why?  I don't know.  I forgot.  People are throwing things at me calling me queer.  At least he didn't say, why not?  Nobody liked me at street level.  His answer was, you shouldn't ask why.  You shouldn't ask why.  Yeah.  You know what?  You're right.  We shouldn't have had you in here, fuckface.  Yeah.  It's called an interview.  We were supposed to ask you.  You fucking...  Go get your easel and your fucking beret, you cunt. 
[03:35:00]  Go get a croissant.  I'm not just meeting you at a Starbucks, stupid.  I got you a shitty book, which me and my girlfriend laughed at.  I know.  You were fucking, like, saying what a big fan you were, and he was getting more fucking  flip with you.  Believe me, I just wanted...  Because it's cool not to have fans or a purpose or any of that shit.  Is that cool?  Really?  If I wish I knew, that's what he thought.  He did for exposure.  Of course he did.  Carl Olenberg fell.  Fuck him.  You're next.  I love how Jimmy has his books in his voice. 
[03:35:30]  It couldn't have been nicer.  Fucking fruit.  What did Jimmy wiping his ass with his DVD?  Ah, but the book was terribly written.  The documentary.  Yeah.  I'm on the wire.  They had to hide for a couple.  He thinks I'm blowing the big secret.  Hey, stupid.  You fuck...  This is not the dark night.  Everybody knows you're here.  You're talking to us.  You're in.  Oh, shit.  It's about as surprising as the ending to the Bible, fuck you.  Yeah.  What do you think happens?  Did you fucking...  Did you almost fall off on your cock helmet and caught the wire?  Yeah.  No, you didn't.  You walked, you waved, and now you're here boring everybody in tears. 
[03:36:00]  Fucking landed in a fountain.  Exactly.  Why don't you fucking eat a croissant and then throw yourself off a building thing?  What have you done lately?  That was 1974.  Exactly.  Yeah.  No shit.  A little sabbatical in between jumps there, fuckface.  How about you start walking again?  I would love if he...  Mr. Artist.  I would love, once he retires, that he, like, he falls off his roof fixing something.  Fucking paralyzed.  How funny would that be?  He slips in his tub.  Now he's shitting into a bag on his hip.  That's fucking...  Not such an artist now, are you there?  Fucking empty that piss bag, douche. 
[03:36:30]  That cunt, he did, he corrected me on everything.  I'm like, this is a horrifying picture.  Well, this is not horrifying.  Really?  Then why don't you live up there?  You fucking...  Why don't you live on the wire?  Let me see that fucking French...  It is an amazing photo, though.  Yeah.  That's a great photo.  Is he laying down?  Yes!  That's what I was trying to show you before.  I did the horrifying photo.  Nice time to take a nap.  And, uh...  That's not horrifying.  Really?  Then why aren't hotels doing it?  Of course it's horrifying.  How the fuck do you say his name if it's not Philippe Petit?  Exactly.  Hey, you.  Hey, asshole that walked in between two buildings. 
[03:37:00]  There's probably some little French thing you gotta do that we're not doing.  Yeah.  I like how we question if somebody really walked on the moon.  That might have been fake.  But I have to fucking take the granted this is for real?  This is fucking...  You could have fucking photoshopped this yesterday.  Fucking asshole.  Yeah, where's the video?  Exactly.  We talked shit two hours later.  He goes, yeah, the, uh...  Twin Towers called me.  Yeah, they called Bin Laden, too.  Fuck that.  Obama at Jordan Marsh.  What?  You think he twinkle-toes his way from room to room when his girlfriend is sleeping? 
[03:37:30]  He enters the room backwards with his ass out.  Moonwalking.  His, quote, long-term girlfriend is sound asleep and Mr. Twinkle Toes is going to the other  side of the house.  I like that Phil Pettish.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Fucking...  Every fucking thing he called out.  I just...  It didn't hit me at the time.  I know. 
[03:38:00]  I saw Carl Lennon.  If I was, I would never question a wire walker.  He fucking fell.  You wouldn't question the wind?  Yeah, I mean, there's not much to figure out there.  It's windy.  He really was a snippy motherfucker.  I wish I would have been as annoyed then as I am now.  I really, I swear to God, it didn't hit me.  You were starting to get there.  I was hoping it would really blow up in his face.  Yeah, but if I don't ask you, you do ask you.  That's why you fucking took a year, otherwise you would have walked up on a string and thrown  it.  In other words, we shouldn't give a fuck at all about this.  That's what you're telling us.  That's why you're making a movie about it, dink.  Exactly.  Write a poem. 
[03:38:30]  I told you all.  You motherfucker.  I told Jimmy on the walkover, I'm kind of disappointed that I didn't go after him a  little bit.  Because I was feeling it.  Big time.  I was so feeling it.  Well, it wasn't my place to do so.  I didn't do it.  But, oh well.  He's in an eye.  But boy, you get me at 11 a.m. and I'm tough.  He's long gone and now we have the balls.  Guy couldn't have been more than 5'6".  The guy's name is Petit and we didn't want to pick on him.  And he didn't want to answer the age question.  Hey, fucking mister, it's all about Art. 
[03:39:00]  How old are you?  If you have friends that are 90 years young, how about you?  How young are you?  How old is your prostate?  And I know teenagers that died.  Great.  Answer the fucking question.  When are you going to be blowing out the candles?  How many are there going to be on the cake?  When they find a lump on your left nut, are you going to fucking imagine that away too?  Right.  With your great fucking positive thinking?  Thoughts on?  Big deal.  We will be reading about him in the future.  I'm going to give it two, three years tops.  Yeah.  Again.  He's going to need a little more attention and he's going to do the wrong thing. 
[03:39:30]  He is.  Yeah.  Again.  Let's do another runner-up line of the fucking day.  We also got to sign a 500-pound bomb from one of those drones.  Ralphie Mae was there?  I couldn't get that one up fast enough.  I was going with a boss joke myself, but you beat me to it.  I didn't know they shipped the boss's act over to Afghanistan.  That would have just been mean-spirited.  Yeah, I know.  He's not a 500-pound bomb.  I'm Philippe Petit.  Yes, you are, Philly.  Are you?  Exactly.  Answer the fucking question. 
[03:40:00]  Right.  I'm trying to call us out because we're not asking you right.  Then I'll help you land on a wrought iron fence next time.  Right.  It goes right through you like a fucking-  Right through your asshole.  Fucking Philippe Petit.  And then I'm giving away the movie, he says.  And then he turns around and gives away his own fucking movie.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah, land.  Holy shit.  Now I wish I could give away more of the movie.  Where are we up to?  If I didn't hate it, I would.  Huh?  I blocked it out like a childhood rape. 
[03:40:30]  Right.  Get the video camera ready, you asshole.  Yeah, it's really cool that there's no videotape of it.  What the fuck are you thinking?  It's not cool.  Right.  Sucks a dick.  Tropical Storm Dolly.  Yeah, Dolly's going to be maybe a one.  A one.  Is that what it's going to be?  Yeah.  What is it called again?  It's all it takes are those houses down there.  It's a one.  Yeah, a category one.  Thank you.  Sure.  Fucking made of mud and balsa wood.  Yeah.  Fucking let's- 
[03:41:00]  Bowl of chili would take the roof off.  Anything else on Philippe Petit?  What else is there to say?  I didn't even realize.  I didn't add it all up.  As we're talking.  I wish I had.  We were so excited, too.  Well, that's what's funny.  You were the biggest fan.  You took the time to research it.  You fucking knew everything about it.  I watched that shit.  He was getting snippy with you.  Oh, he didn't like Elaine Robert.  That set him on the wrong path.  Oh, I knew that was going to.  You know.  Well, I wouldn't.  Because French guys are like catty cunts, is what they are.  And you can't, you know.  Yeah.  They're just fucking-  He made it sound like the guy was climbing a ladder.  I mean, that's pretty impressive, too. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  He didn't just go once, either.  Fucko.  He does it all over the world.  That's right, motherfucker.  Motherfucker.  You fucking sang your modern English.  You fucking sang always something there to remind me.  And then you fucking retired.  Thank you, Norman Greenbaum.  This guy, Elaine Robert, is going up and down the buildings, causing a ruckus everywhere.  What do you do?  One walk and you're fucking finished.  Watch out, Jimmy.  I heard he's downstairs waiting for you.  Big deal.  What are you going to do?  Walk across something?  That was my big comeback.  A great rant, but modern English saying I'll melt with you.  What did I say?  You said always something there to remind me. 
[03:42:00]  Which is by that band-  Exactly.  Who gives a fuck one and who gives a fuck two?  I forgot the name of that fucking 80s band.  Naked Eyes.  Thank you.  Exactly.  I'm glad I mixed that up.  I fucking watched this guy's movie yesterday.  Motherfucker.  Take your wire and choke yourself.  I'm singing Chicago.  Fucking guy.  I should have just talked about Elaine Robert more. 
[03:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  I don't know who that is.  Shut up, you fucking dude.  Of course you do.  You're a liar.  We know-  Oh, man.  He's lying.  I didn't like his lies.  Is that the Pakistani version?  Pakistani Chicago.  It's a cover band in fucking Kabul.  A cover band.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Why don't we-  Right here.  Why don't we do a line of-  Where you going, the doctors?  Yeah, I gotta see what this wing's all about.  Stupid wing. 
[03:43:00]  Fuck.  Fucking torn tendon.  Me too.  So, I have to-  I have an 11 o'clock, actually, on the other side of town.  All right.  Fuck you, Philippe Petit.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  See how stupid we are?  Well, the person who has a blue sun is that girl. 
[03:43:30]  Well, that's-  I got a new husband that's banging me good.  As soon as I said that, I knew that was going to be trouble.  Fuck.  When did you say that?  Exactly.  I heard myself saying that.  What am I doing to myself?  All right.  Scott, Rigsby.com.  R-I-G-S-B-Y.com.  And let's put you over the top and win that award.  Appreciate it, brother. 
[03:44:00]  It's been fun.  Man, you guys are hilarious.  And your dad still won't be impressed.  Who knows, man?  You might put him over the top.  He might finally be impressed.  That pisses me off.  You should take your special fee and kick him into the groin.  That's what I would do.  I think he is impressed.  He's just one of those guys who doesn't know how to express his emotions.  Yeah, he's in that generation.  I think he is.  He probably is.  He just doesn't know how to express it.  What else does his son have to do?  But again, it's probably not a case of not being proud.  It probably is literally a case of a lot of old people are shitty at expressing anything. 
[03:44:30]  Right.  Except for-  I like that about him.  I would agree.  They are.  I like that about my dad.  But mom is supportive.  I know he loves me.  And your friends are supportive.  Men are considered, you're supposed to be rocks, whereas women are supposed to be the emotional  ones or the ones that get carried away.  That's old school.  That is old school.  Lemon fags.  By the way, a lot of people think we're going to trash you tomorrow there, Scott.  No.  Because that's what we do.  We wait for you to leave.  That's not happening.  My friends butt my balls all the time.  That's not happening.  No.  Absolutely not.  We took a couple little shots. 
[03:45:00]  Spatula feet, things like that.  Now, if you try to cross a highway with those feet, we'll be fucking jumping all over you.  I just wish I would have fucking- I was starting to get irritated at one point.  With Philippe?  Yeah.  And I can feel myself-  That's all I want to talk about.  Can we, like, call me later so we can talk about this asshole for another hour?  Yeah, I would like to.  I'm serious.  I'm annoyed that I don't want to call him out now and I didn't in front of him while  I was trying to pin him on one point.  What was that?  Just that fucking you do plan and you do look for the negative.  Yeah.  Of course you do.  But I didn't do it aggressively, although I should have. 
[03:45:30]  So I'm just a douche.  You should have said, do your girlfriend shave her pussy?  Like the rest of those dirty French?  I should have said, what would you have done if it snowed that day?  Would you have slipped?  By the way, he had this long-term girlfriend that was there for his dream and he broke up  with her after he made the walk.  And this French broad goes, it was the perfect time to break up with me.  Exactly.  It was a perfect ending to our relationship. 
[03:46:00]  Can everybody stop taking lemons and trying to make lemonade and just admit the guy's  a self-centered douche?  Yeah, he dumped it because he knew there's going to be some fucking girls waiting to suck  his cock because now he's famous.  And she's making it sound romantic.  Christ, it's an easier way to get in pussy than that.  Exactly.  Fucking moly.  He tells a story how he had a romp in the hay after that.  Yeah, with some fan.  He got fans immediately.  What was his name?  He banged one of them.  Who from?  Whoa, hey.  Tom Petit.  All right.  Fuck.  Fuck Philippe Petit in his fart box. 
[03:46:30]  I love how this.  He just turned on him.  I love how the whole Exxam show is dedicated to shitting on the guy.  You know why?  Because I invested a lot of time in this fucking guy with his dumb documentary and fucking  Googling my ass off the last few days.  This fucking guy is pissed off because we pronounced his name wrong.  Sorry, I'm not French.  I did the best I could.  I took two years of fucking French.  I should have taken three, obviously.  You're lucky we didn't call you a douche with a shitty documentary with no footage in it.  Right.  That's what we should have called you.  Le douche.  That was all right. 
[03:47:00]  How do you make a fucking hour and a half documentary with three pictures of you  in between two big buildings?  Exactly.  We get it.  There was a wire.  You walked.  I'm right already.  Next.  Next, what else do you do?  Imagine he was, uh, this might be a little sensitive, but imagine fully petite was doing  that tightrope act on 9-11.  Yeah, I was going to say that up.  That would have been the one you could have really zang him with.  Too bad you didn't do it on September 11th, you fucking jerk.  Then, now what? 
[03:47:30]  Now what, sir?  Now what?  You have to just go to the other building.  He probably would have been the only one that survived.  I don't know.  If I want to hit you, just go to the other one.  That's right.  Yeah.  That's right.  Ooh, walk on a wire.  Ooh.  Although, I don't know that wire would have held up, see, if one of them went down.  Yeah, but it would have.  What, are you using his positive thinking method?  Yes.  I would just keep my eye on the thing.  Really?  What do you do if you drop the stick, faggot?  Answer the question.  I didn't answer that either.  Drop the stick.  Yeah, that's right. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, but in layman's terms, Jimmy, what do you mean?  Yeah, exactly.  I can't wait to listen to the interview again.  And I was actually mocking, like, my heart.  Yeah, put your hands facing up.  Put your hands facing up.  Yeah, what's he going to, Jimmy, you going to fall off his stool three feet high?  Exactly.  It's a radio show.  How about just answering the question?  He corrected you on every turn.  I really would like to scream in his fucking face right now, but I just didn't, it didn't,  it was, as it was happening, I did not put two and two together.  I wish I would have.  By the way, your sweater was awful.  It was chilly in studio.  He put on the queerest sweater I've ever seen.  Could have been gay if he put on Rock Hudson's body. 
[03:48:30]  If he threw it around himself like a stall, that wouldn't have been gay.  That's definitely a re-gifter at Christmas.  Oh, it's just awful.  It's fucking awful.  We got to go, because we both have doctor appointments today.  Yeah, go fuck yourself, everybody.  Can you be shyness?  Why are you going to the doctor?  Just think positive.  Your nose will clear up.  All right.  What is that?  I got to go to comics.  Anybody know where that is?  Oh, next week, Nick DiPaolo at comics.  14th and 9th Avenue.  I got to go over there today and be interviewed by some magazine.  Oh, you really?  Yeah, 14th. 
[03:49:00]  But yeah, August 1st and 2nd at comics.  C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com, one word.  Go to nickdip.com for, you know, fucking ticket information.  August 1st and 2nd.  It'll be terrific.  You come to New York a lot, Scott?  Yeah, I should be back in.  All right, you come see us next time.  You're all right, man.  I'd love to.  Yeah.  Next time we're getting your dad on the phone.  All right.  We're going to ask him, what is it going to take?  All right, let's go home.  All right.  Thanks, Nick.  Nick DiPaolo, nickdip.com.  You got it.  Thank you, fellas.  All right, fuck off.  You got a war face? 
[03:49:30]  What the F?  Ah!  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  No!  Bulls, you didn't convince me.  Let me see your real war face.  No!  You don't scare me.  Work on me.  Jackass.  I'm scared.  I'm scared. </pre>
