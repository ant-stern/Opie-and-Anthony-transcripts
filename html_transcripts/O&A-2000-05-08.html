<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts providing contact information and previewing a discussion about Cardinal O'Connor's funeral, immediately transitioning into crude jokes about Rudy Giuliani's potential flatulence near Hillary Clinton during the service.  This segues into a caller, J.R., reporting seeing billboards advertising the show, sparking a discussion about a CBS executive meeting and listener-driven promotional efforts.  The conversation then jumps to graphic descriptions of violence in *Gladiator*, followed by speculation about an actor's death during the filming of *Ben-Hur*.  The topic shifts to Napster, its popularity, Metallica's lawsuit, and the broader implications of copyright infringement for artists and the hosts' own show.  Further listener calls cover a lacrosse game, a radio host complaint, and plans for distributing "Wow" stickers at a wrestling event.  The Cardinal's funeral is revisited, including observations about attendees like Bill and George Bush, and more crude humor involving imagined sexual acts. The segment includes ads for the Vermont Teddy Bear Company and Connecticut Schools of Broadcasting, ending with a sports discussion and a mention of Bob Sheppard's long career as a stadium announcer. A brief interview with Taz, a listener who erected a billboard, is included.


The show continues with a discussion of Scott Muni's successful radio show, focusing on its high ratings in the 25-54 male demographic, a demographic Opie and Anthony also dominate.  They criticize a newspaper's reporting and the radio columnist David Hinckley for their perceived lack of understanding of New York radio. The conversation turns to their station's weekend scheduling problems and their dislike of airing "best of" shows instead of utilizing other talent, spurred by a listener's complaint about the station's bland classic rock weekend programming.  Graphic details of photos from Shannon's "hot wax episode" found on an unofficial website are discussed. The segment includes numerous listener calls: one recounts a humorous encounter with news vans at the Cardinal's funeral; another describes a purportedly inebriated Tom Brokaw giving a terrible commencement speech (with invented details of Brokaw’s behavior); and several calls detail bachelor party experiences, ranging from tame to those involving strippers and explicit sexual acts.  The hosts debate infidelity and premarital sex in the context of bachelor parties.  Opie’s lack of a high school diploma and failed attempts at getting an honorary one are also discussed.  The segment concludes with advertisements for Fidelity Diamonds and Stacker 2, followed by discussion about the cancellation of Bridget the Midget's appearance, with speculation about interference from another radio station, and further discussion on the popularity and distribution of their “WOW” stickers, including high eBay prices and complaints from the person responsible for distribution.


The final segment focuses heavily on Earl, the employee responsible for distributing "Wow" stickers, who the hosts repeatedly call "the sloth" due to his perceived slowness.  They play audio clips of Earl's seemingly stressed on-air breaks, describing him as "desperate."  His musical taste (Kits and Metallica, but not Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird"), job duties (including running a Don and Mike show later), and struggles with improperly sized envelopes from listeners are discussed. A caller, Vinny, offers a racially charged compliment of Earl, which is met with further ribbing from the hosts.  The hosts attempt to obtain audio recordings ("air checks") of Earl's broadcasts, ultimately deciding to retrieve them from a "skimmer". The segment ends with promotion of their appearance at a WWF Raw event with their WOW van.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  What kind of show is this?  It was like somebody wearing hot wax in your ears until your brain was completely numb.  The Hulpy and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Yes, we are here.  It's the O&A Show.  Hey, we gotta do a quick break and then we can start the show, Anthony.  Still running a little late here.  We can give out the vitals, I guess.  What vitals?  Like the phone numbers and stuff. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  Phone line's 212-757-1027.  The fax line, 212-957-9639.  Big hi to everyone on shoutcast.com.  How you doing?  And, of course, instant feedback through the WNEW website.  Yeah.  All right.  I guess those are the technicals.  We have lots of show to do today.  We just gotta get through a few more commercials.  And we'll start the festivities, right?  I know.  Oh, we'll get into the Cardinal thing. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, big, huge party going on at St. Patrick's Cathedral today.  Star-studded.  Star-studded is right.  With sleeping politicians.  Rudy G sitting exactly behind the president and Hillary.  Hillary right behind him.  I hope he ate something like, you know, burritos, beans and stuff.  Wouldn't that be funny if he was just, like, putting out the worst farts ever and she's right behind him?  I would do that constantly.  Just, like, those hot ones that just go, you know?  And you feel the heat from them and you just know before you even get a whip that it's, like, one of the worst ones ever. 
[00:01:30]  You feel the heat halfway down your thigh.  That would be hysterical.  Hillary's right behind him.  Oh, my God, Rudy.  So politicians do fart?  Sorry, it's my prostate.  It's on fire.  Just like a salad shooter.  I have some Mexican, Hillary.  Sorry you got the feet behind me.  They can't tell if the smoke is from those little things that the priests and bishops are waving around or it's coming from Rudy's ass. 
[00:02:00]  Big smoke.  I would love to get into that beluga head of his and see what he's saying.  See what he's cooking up in that head.  Oh, you know he's saying something about Hillary.  I mean, she's sitting right in front of him.  Wouldn't that be funny?  Like a little lull in the sermon.  And, of course, Cardinal O'Connor was a great man.  What?  What did he just say?  He called me a twat.  Twat.  All right, we got to take a quick break, Anthony.  Yeah, we'll be back. 
[00:02:30]  Plenty to talk about today.  Yes, of course.  I'm just looking at the coverage on TV.  He's got to do the one-cheek sneak on the wooden pew, you know, because it's all flat up against him.  Oh, I'm kind of squeaking.  Patrick Moynihan looks dead.  Is he still alive?  They just showed him.  He looks dead.  He looks dead.  Dead.  He does?  He looks dead.  Oh, man, I can't quite. 
[00:03:00]  Oh.  He looks dead.  Oh.  I'm trying to squeak one out.  That's just puish.  Hey, Hillary.  We'll have J.R. start the festivities today.  J.R., what's going on?  Nothing.  I'm just cruising down the expressway, and I see this huge sign over the overpass.  It says, hey, Stern, is that a train?  Open Anthony, 1027.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Who the hell's doing it?  All I can say is, because, you know, we're in so much trouble with the company. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  We truly have nothing to do with these signs that are popping up everywhere.  Yeah, you know what?  It's still awesome, though.  It's pretty funny, but we have nothing to do with them.  I heard there was some huge meeting, and the huge boss.  The huge boss was there.  Yeah.  And someone, like, stands up and asks them about us being syndicated.  Oh, my God.  You can't ask them about that.  Well, there's a big management meeting going on in Vegas, and the boss is,  Viva Las Vegas!  The boss is CBS executives. 
[00:04:00]  Viva Las Vegas!  Thanks for that update, J.R.  You're fine, guys.  Have a good one.  All right, you too.  You think Jeremy and Ken Stevens will go to one of those chapels and get married in Vegas?  Why?  It's a joke.  Why?  It's a little joke.  So, we can say it.  The company was having a huge stockholders meeting.  Yeah.  That's like, you know, the stockholders, they're like the serious, you know,  stuffy suit guys and stuff.  They get them all together every once in a while for these stockholder meetings. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  And I guess in the middle of it, the big, big, big, big, big boss is standing there  doing a little Q&A.  The Jesus Christ of CBS.  Right.  He's doing a little Q&A, and someone stands up that can only be described  as one of our listeners and asked the big boss when you and I are going to be syndicated  at the stockholders meeting.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  So, I had to take a call from our boss here from Vegas.  He goes, guys, you had nothing to do with this, right? 
[00:05:00]  Oh, no.  Come on.  I'm telling everyone we had no idea about this.  You would tell me, right?  I'm like, yeah, we had nothing to do with it.  At this point, our listeners have the minds of their own.  They certainly do.  We can't stop them anymore.  Oh, boy.  I was told there's another check in the stupid column today.  I'm going to have to put the extension on a piece of paper just to add on the stupid  column.  Another check.  It's a stockholders meeting, bud. 
[00:05:30]  You can't be doing that.  What do you think?  It's one of your funny little road shows?  Boobs with all your goddamn degenerates gathering around waiting to say boobs?  Just stockholders meeting.  Damn, it's not having your listeners there asking about syndication.  Syndication when there's jet packs on people's back.  Syndication on the space station.  How about that one?  How about that?  Syndication on the moon base.  So, we can say we had nothing to do with that. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Please.  Made us laugh pretty hard, though.  All right.  Let's take a break, Anthony, and we'll start the festivities, all right?  Let's do that.  Phone line 212-757-1027.  Yopi and Anthony.  The damn flag of disaster.  1027.  W-A-W.  What a day, what a day, what a day, what a day, what a day, what a day, what a day.  See you on the show. 
[00:06:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Phone line 212-757-1027.  We got to talk to Taz real fast.  Taz, what's going on today?  O-N-A, what's up?  What's up, man?  What a day, what a day.  Well, Taz is back on the streets.  I can tell.  I hung that thing up.  I didn't even get home before I heard that listen to call in.  That's weird.  That's whacked out, man.  That's great. 
[00:07:00]  Where was it?  Same place, different sides.  It was on the drive home instead of the drive in.  And where is that?  That's where Half Howell Road goes over the expressway.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the whole expressway saw it?  Well, they saw me hanging it.  I was getting honked at and everything.  So you definitely got, you got cloud over here in Suffolk County.  Well, we appreciate that.  How big was the banner there?  Same size as the other one.  Right off the bed.  You guys are taking it upon yourselves to spread the word of the show.  It's hilarious, man.  Well, you know, that other person, I won't mention their name, is very, very boring, man. 
[00:07:30]  It's the same thing every day.  I mean, please.  Please.  What, Scott Shannon?  Time check, 620.  All right.  Well, Taz, thank you for spreading the word of the show, I guess.  No problem, boys.  Will you be attacking in the near future again?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  And for anybody who's interested, we're going to be doing a fine painting show Wednesday 
[00:08:00]  night up on 231, up on the Strip.  Let the little kiddies get a little action into this.  Babylon Speedway.  Yes.  There you go.  Very cool.  See you at Park Avenue.  All right, man.  You were there.  Right in.  You used to cruise that Strip.  I used to cruise up and down there going to another radio station.  Unfortunately, I had an old piece of crap, Nova.  Come on.  You had to do pretty good anyway.  Yeah, this road on Long Island, it's nothing but like muscle cars just going up and down,  up and down, up and down.  Everyone checking out everyone's ride and stuff. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Every weekend.  So.  All right, Taz.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Syndication Underground.  Yeah.  Peace.  Peace.  It's happening.  What's this?  Syndication Underground.  What, Anthony?  What's this Anthony on Instant Feedback trying to hang me out to drive for?  What?  Anthony from Brooklyn.  Yes, you did see me in the movie theater in Sheepshead Bay, but it says, Opie, ask him  about, I saw him in a three-piece suit.  I wasn't wearing a three-piece suit, you douche.  I was wearing shorts. 
[00:09:00]  A three-piece suit.  I don't think you own a three-piece suit.  Exactly.  You don't even own a suit.  There's some homeless guy walking around Huntington with my three-piece suit, Opie.  Right.  I saw a gladiator.  Yeah, I saw a gladiator last night.  God damn.  I loved it.  I thought it was really good.  Well, yeah, we explained it a little bit in the back office.  We were discussing it, and yeah, I thought in general it was a really good movie.  I just thought they could have worked on the storyline a little better.  Yeah?  But I'm pretty damn picky when I'm spending like $9.50 a shot for a movie these days. 
[00:09:30]  I'll sacrifice a little bit of storyline for some major bloodshed.  God damn, was that great.  Well, the fight scenes and the bloodshed was amazing.  It really was.  Decapitations.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  The opening scene was just so goddamn violent.  Yeah.  Wow.  They had a big battle.  Yeah.  And then some of the gladiator stuff, man.  Unbelievable.  When Russell Crowe took the two swords out of the guy's chest and then lops his head off  with both swords. 
[00:10:00]  Classic.  Nothing better than that.  Classic.  It blows away anything.  Any of those old movies.  Like everyone's saying, ho, ho, hum.  I read some of the reviews.  Ho, hum.  Oh, been done already.  Ben-Hur.  Braveheart.  Spartacus.  All that, yeah.  Now, Braveheart was great as far as the battle scenes go, you know?  But I mean, Ben-Hur and Spartacus?  Get out of here.  There was nothing in there.  There's no blood.  The guy falls off the chariot, gets run over.  Oh, he's a little, you know, chewed up.  Some abrasions.  Yeah.  Major League decapitations. 
[00:10:30]  Impalements.  Blood everywhere.  Blood, guts.  A woman completely cut in half.  God, that was great.  It was sick.  I loved it.  It cleaned up in the theaters this weekend, too.  Yeah, it's like 37 mil or something.  Just about 33 mil.  33 mil?  You, 571 in second.  Frequency, which you saw, right?  Yeah, frequency.  Was that good?  Yeah, pretty good.  Yeah.  A little predictable, a little, you know, sensitive.  Yeah, that was, like, really, like, touching storyline to it. 
[00:11:00]  Did it have, like, a chick flick thing to it there?  No, not really chick flick.  If it would get a little more mushy, it would have been chick flick.  Someone's saying you're ruining the movie.  Not really.  No, I swear to you, I'm not ruining it.  And there's no way to really ruin the movie.  Don't worry about it.  Chris, on line 11, you're high.  Chris, don't worry.  There's nothing to ruin.  Chris, he's not ruining the movie.  Not really.  You're going to see some great battle scenes.  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah, I know, but what about The Sixth Sense?  We didn't talk about that for you, right?  I'm not going to say anything.  Yeah, I know.  If it's a great movie, it's a great movie, right? 
[00:11:30]  I don't think he's ruining it.  I think everyone knows it's a pretty damn violent movie just by watching the previews  that they've been running for like three months.  Yeah, but you don't have to tell it's all, like, the gut and gory scenes.  Dude, the movie's called Gladiator.  What were you expecting?  Touching love stories.  No, no, no.  Of course there's going to be decapitations.  I don't think that'll ruin it for you at all.  All right, cool.  All right, man.  Syndication on the ground.  It's happening.  It's happening in more places than I can keep up with.  Where can we get it?  Every time we announce one, the lawyers are one step behind you.  Lawyers, lawyers.  Stay away from lawyers. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  We all know about that.  So every once in a while, you just may hear, like, a website thrown out there in the middle  of a conversation.  All right, cool, guys.  Tell it to your friends that are out of town and can't get us on.  Yeah, definitely.  I've got so many friends at college that are looking for it, looking for it.  Well, see, that's the problem, too, because, like, we do find out about a website, and  then all the people that can get us on the radio are checking it out on the Internet.  No, that's there for the people in other states.  Yep.  You know, our listeners that had to move away to go to school or for a job.  That's why, you know, we don't really want to give it out to you guys. 
[00:12:30]  You got it.  All right, man.  All right, take it easy.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Phil.  Phil, you're next on NEW.  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up, Phil?  Nothing.  You're lying about Ben-Hur, though.  Why?  Why?  That dude didn't just get a couple bumps and bruises when he fell off the chariot.  He actually died in real life.  What?  The actor?  Yes.  Come on.  No, seriously.  Died in real life.  Filming that?  What?  Yeah, filming it. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, no, he didn't.  Yeah, that's a real death scene.  Don't be silly.  They don't do that.  I wonder if we...  Oh, yeah, they did back in the day, back in, like, the 60s, 70s, whatever, when that was  made.  I wonder if we could confirm that somehow, man.  They did that all the time.  No.  No.  I don't think they did it all the time.  Hell no.  You could tell the guy with that makeup on.  He's telling the...  He's talking.  He's giving his death speech to Ben-Hur.  The guy...  Uh...  Oh, stop it.  All right.  Syndication two weeks from now.  Thank you.  Bill from Brooklyn.  Gladiator rocked. 
[00:13:30]  It didn't go ten minutes without someone's head being cut off.  Amazing.  See, that's what I like about a movie.  If I go to a movie called Gladiator, I want to see some battle scenes and some carnage.  Some death and destruction.  Right.  Well, I mean, the one chick playing another incest part, Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's the chick from Devil's Advocate.  Oh, yeah.  That was sleeping with Keanu.  Hmm.  Yeah.  And in this movie, there's a little incest going on.  That was a little disturbing to me. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, that was.  To say the least.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Someone else saying the guy in Ben-Hur did die.  Trace, what's up?  There was someone that died during the Ben-Hur filming.  Yeah, but it wasn't that guy.  No, it was somebody on the chair.  He got crushed.  I wouldn't doubt that that probably happened, but I don't know.  It wasn't one of the stars and it wasn't because of it.  No, it wasn't.  Yeah, they made some brutal movies back then, but on camera, what I see on screen, Ben-Hur  didn't compare.  Gladiator had a lot more blood and guts. 
[00:14:30]  You know the guy who was in it, Russell Crowe?  Yeah.  My, you know, he did The Insider?  Yeah.  Yeah.  God, they made him up in that, huh?  Or some fat old guy.  I don't know if it was good or bad, but my wife said I looked like him.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And I didn't see the movie, but.  God, isn't that so good?  Like, hey, I look like Russell Crowe, but from the inside.  Yeah, he looks like crap.  You know, without any hair and holes and, like, after they aged you.  Fat.  He had to gain a bunch of weight for that one.  Yeah, well, at least she got that part right. 
[00:15:00]  I don't know how the hell he did that, because, you know, the last movie he made, The Insider,  he had to gain, like, 40 pounds, and he looked all haggard and everything.  Of course, some of it was makeup.  But then in this movie, you had to get down to, like, gladiator weight.  Right.  Fighting weight, you know?  How the hell they do that?  All right, a lot of people are saying there was a guy that died of Ben-Hur.  I wouldn't doubt there was a guy that died in the filming, but it wasn't an on-camera death.  You know the guy that was in charge of the gladiators?  I forget his name, that famous actor?  Yeah.  He's dead.  From the gladiator movie. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, he died during the filming.  During the filming.  You know what they had to do?  What the hell's his name now?  I forgot his name.  Isn't that the guy from The Good, The Bad, The Ugly?  No.  You sure?  Now we're going to get 1,800 emails.  You sure?  The second we get it right.  Are you sure he wasn't one of the guys from The Good, The Bad, The Ugly?  No.  Positive.  All right.  Yeah.  Now we just got to wait until somebody chimes in with the name of that guy.  Yeah, but he died.  He had one or two scenes left to film and he died of a heart attack. 
[00:16:00]  You know what they did?  They did some kind of digital thing, right?  Yeah, they took a regular, just some other actor standing in the spot and acting with whoever the other guy was supposed to act with.  And then they used a computer-generated face.  They kind of took his face and digitally put it on the other guy's body to do the part.  Because I read about that before I saw the movie yesterday.  You couldn't tell.  Yeah.  I was waiting for the scene.  We don't want to give it away.  I'm like, you can't tell.  Okay, here we go.  I'm waiting.  I'm waiting for it to come in. 
[00:16:30]  Oliver Reed?  Oliver Reed, yes.  It didn't come in yet.  I'm just saying.  No, it is.  I got that, though.  It is Oliver Reed.  So, ha-ha, I got it before anyone else sent it in.  His name is Oliver Reed.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, good movie, though.  What other movies was he in?  It's driving me nuts.  Hmm.  He was in a real famous movie as a much younger guy, and I can't, it's driving me, it'll come to me, whatever.  He's in a crap load of movies.  No, I know, but a classic. 
[00:17:00]  Let's see.  Oliver Reed.  The guy in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly was Eli Wallach.  Well, yeah.  Speaking of gore and violence, I bought Soldier of Fortune on your word.  It's awesome.  Yeah.  I'm still trying to play Soldier of Fortune.  Mm-hmm.  Steve C. from the unofficial website turned me on to this game, and I'm back in the office playing it all the time.  I put the setting on impossible, because I hate running, I usually, the first ten minutes of me playing a game is difficult, but then I usually run right through it. 
[00:17:30]  Mm-hmm.  You get the hang of it, and you run right through it.  So I figure it out.  I put it on, I think the actual name of the setting is, no way in hell you're ever getting through this game.  So I put it on that.  There's no medipacks to help you out during the way if you get injured.  There's like no ammo.  You're just scrounging around for ammo.  And the guys that you're shooting have armor plating on them.  They don't die.  There's too many of them.  So I'm really having a tough time with this.  And Steve C. is like, well, what setting you got?  I go, I got the impossible setting on. 
[00:18:00]  He goes, oh, I put it on the easiest setting.  And he's having a problem.  And he goes, I put it on all the cheat codes so he could walk through walls, fly, unlimited ammo, unlimited health.  Steve, is that fun?  After a while, God mode is fun.  Like you're just, you're sleeping, walking through, just shooting everything.  It kind of takes the, you've got to get back at the game, though, because you spend so many hours getting so frustrated.  And you're like, screw it, I'm going to God mode.  A week ago, I thought I was in the final battle of this game.  A week ago.  I get through this whole thing where I'm in the back of a C-130 plane, and I'm kicking ass. 
[00:18:30]  And there were so many soldiers coming at me.  I'm like, this has to be the big finish.  I get done with it.  Congratulations.  Mission accomplished.  Next mission.  What?  It's impossible.  But I love it.  Sniper rifle rules in this game.  Know what they've got to do?  They've got to come out with a game based on Gladiator.  Oh, that would be good.  That would rock.  Where you pick your weapons and stuff.  I love that big, spiky thing on the end of the chain.  Did you see one Gladiator runs out? 
[00:19:00]  Oliver Reed was in Tommy.  That was what I was thinking of.  Oh, Tommy.  Thank you, Mike.  Right.  Okay.  Because I, oh, thank you.  As a much younger guy.  I saw that on, whatever, one of the channels recently.  Hey, that one Gladiator guy, he wasn't even a Gladiator.  He was like just a slave.  He was a perverted, uh, he was a perverted uncle in Tommy, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Just a slave that's, uh, ready to be, you know, thrown out there and with the rest of  the Gladiators to be killed.  And he pees himself.  Mm-hmm.  Waiting to get out.  And then the second he steps out the door, he gets that big spiky thing in the face right 
[00:19:30]  to his head.  Like crack.  Whoa.  And the one guy has to cut off the arm.  So, because they're all chained together, just slices his arm off.  He starts whacking people with the guy's severed arm on the end of a chain.  Yeah.  Sick.  It was a sick moment.  Love it.  Yeah.  The mace, it's called.  It was very entertaining.  It was a big spiky thing.  Wham!  All right, Anthony, we got to take a break.  Uh, we started on one subject, moved on to another here, but that's okay.  I, I, I wanted to, people are really starting to do some crazy stuff for our radio show with 
[00:20:00]  the banners showing up over, uh, the highways and the byways.  We had the guy, you know, writing Wow in the Sky last week, Anthony, over Central Park.  Yeah.  Uh, we, we did start a contest, but I don't know what the hell happened to it.  We were going to give away, like, a, a really sick prize to, to the listener that, uh, did  the biggest display for our radio show.  We're talking really sick.  Well, like, I mean, we got a couple already.  I mean, you know, hanging signs over the highways and byways and, and, and skywriting.  That's, that's, that's pretty good.  I'm talking the prize is really sick.  Oh, yeah, the prize is, well, the prize is, I'll say it. 
[00:20:30]  We don't have to name the company or anything.  We were going to give away a ride.  Yeah.  A brand new ride.  A brand new vehicle.  I need to know what the hell's going on with that because, uh, because our listeners are  ready to just go off.  A new car!  Da-dun-dun!  Da-dun-dun!  They're ready to just go off on this.  Loser.  Everyone's, uh, you know.  A new car!  Everyone's piping in with movies that Oliver Reed was in.  We don't, we don't care.  No, the one I was thinking of was Tommy and we got it. 
[00:21:00]  So thank you for that.  Three Musketeers.  Yeah, I remember that one.  What was the one with King Fufu?  Burnt Offerings.  Was he?  All right.  Got to take a break and we'll be back.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We'll move on because if we start talking more about Gladiator, you guys are going  to just, you know.  Going to get pissed.  It doesn't have any big ending things, so don't worry about it.  You're going to tune out the show and that's not cool.  So, uh, let's, uh, let's move on to something else.  All right.  We'll be back.  Hey, this is Jim Brewer and I've been up since like, oh, I don't know, yesterday. 
[00:21:30]  And the only thing that gets me going, Hammer, is O.P. and Anthony.  I'm talking in 102.7 N.E.W., Hammer.  Oh, yeah, P.  Anthony.  Yeah?  Sorry.  Just thinking of something funny.  Yeah.  Um, we got to welcome, um, a sponsor back to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, okay.  The Connecticut Schools of Broadcasting.  Really?  Yes.  Well, O.P., why don't you take this one?

God, I want to punch you in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW.  The game is called What's in My Pants.  Yeah.  You're going to steal our bits.  You might as well call it what we call it.  A little message for someone out there. 
[00:23:30]  Phone line 212-757-1027.  Fax line 212-957-9639.  The game is called What's in My Pants.  Not What's Her Hair Do or some stupid name like that.  It seems like some people are getting a little desperate, Anthony.  It seems that way.  A little desperate.  That's all right.  Anyway, let's rock and roll, huh? 
[00:24:00]  The goddamn cardinal thing is still going on.  Oh, they better hurry up because some of these bishops are going to drop dead.  Yeah, I know.  They're older than dirt themselves, man.  Look at this guy that's talking now.  Hurry it up already.  You're going to lose a couple of these guys.  Sean, what's going on?  Yeah, I just wanted to tell you guys that I was on Napster, the MP3 thingy.  Yeah.  And you guys have bits on there.  Yeah, I've heard about that.  I was downloading them like crazy. 
[00:24:30]  It was awesome.  It's like a virus.  You just got to keep spreading it all over the Internet for us.  That Napster, Napster.com is pretty cool.  I hear Metallica had a problem with it.  People can get on this Napster service and trade songs.  Any song you want, you can find on this.  It's all free.  I mean anything.  And it's all free.  So Metallica's getting upset trying to sue this guy.  I think he's only like 19 years old who put this whole thing together. 
[00:25:00]  And his defense is, hey, I'm not making any money off of this.  It's free.  It's just like if somebody walked up in the street and said, hey, I'll trade you this CD for this CD.  Sure.  It has nothing to do with copyright infringement or selling anything or making money.  So get this.  The record companies, some of them are thinking of getting together or one record company and buying this kid out.  But 19 years old, he's on the verge of being a multimillionaire just to keep this service off the Internet.  Because they're trading music.  All right.  So they get rid of him. 
[00:25:30]  Can't someone else just start up the same damn thing somewhere else?  Get your program together because it looks like it's worth a lot of cash.  Man.  I mean, what a brilliant move.  I think that's the website that Limp Bizkit and Cypress Hill are going to do a tour.  Yeah, it is.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it is.  That website is sponsoring them?  Yep.  Yeah.  Metallica, that seems a little like, you know.  But you guys.  Get over it, guys.  I think you're making enough cake.  Don't worry about it.  No, it's weird with Metallica complaining.  And I'm a huge Metallica fan.  If you know anything about those guys, they were so on the ground for so many years. 
[00:26:00]  And the way they became popular was people kind of just, you know,  trading their stuff and trading and word of mouth type of thing.  So now it's the Internet and they're freaking out.  Well, Ben agrees that Metallica is right on with what they're doing.  Thank you, Sean.  I'm going to move on to Ben real fast.  All right, man.  Ben, let me get him straight.  Because I'm a musician and I wouldn't like blah, blah, blah.  Let's hear it, man.  Ben, what's going on?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Look, I can't hear you guys.  We're right here.  Some of the phones, sometimes you get in and you get a bad line or something. 
[00:26:30]  Because, I don't know.  We'll just speak.  All right, cool.  I don't know, man.  Like, I'm an artist.  I go to art school.  And it seems to me like if an Internet company just took my work and they just started giving  it away for free, suddenly, you know, I can't make a living.  They're not, though.  The company is like the middleman.  Napster is just a place where people go, virtually meet, and exchange songs that they own, that  they have in their possession.  Well, it's like the, you know, the getaway guy saying he has nothing to do with the robbery. 
[00:27:00]  No, it's like if I came up to you and said, hey, man, you know, I got this CD.  And you said, yeah, I got this one.  You want to trade?  And I say, yeah.  And, Ben, if I was an up-and-coming artist, I would like something like this.  And you know how fast they could spread the word for you?  Yeah, it's definitely cool for the, like, PR type stuff.  And Natalya, you know, is not hurting for money.  I don't think so.  I think they're making a boatload off of that Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack.  See, Ben, we could talk from experience.  I mean, Ant and I, very popular in New York. 
[00:27:30]  We were very popular in Boston.  Lately, just because of the Internet and these MP3 sites and the, you know, underground syndication  and all, the word of Opie and Anthony is being spread all over the country like the word.  Like that.  It's like some kind of a religion.  It is in a way, God damn it.  Oh, thank you, Logan.  I don't know, man.  It seems like they're taking some revenue away from some, you know, hard-working guys.  But it's just a quick way to spread the word, too, man.  Yeah.  You know?  And all our stuff is all over the Internet for free.  We don't care.  We don't care. 
[00:28:00]  Let her rip, man.  Know how many people have downloaded?  You guys got contracts.  Underground.  Invade.  We make okay money.  You know, we're not greedy, though.  We understand that, you know, this is a way to spread the word, too.  I only make half okay money.  Let's get that straight.  All right.  All right.  I'll see you guys.  Over and out, Diamond Dust.  10-4.  Diamond Dust is 10-10-10-8.  Jim, what's going on?  Yeah, I hope you have to do.  Do you guys know that you can get stuff off from your radio show from Napster?  Oh, my God.  Call the lawyers.  No, no. 
[00:28:30]  Screw the lawyers, man.  I know.  We know.  Dude, they have all these old skits on, like, your old radio station, like the 100 Grand.  You guys remember that?  Yeah.  Well, the 100 Grand.  They don't have that on there.  They have a lot of stuff on there.  The 100 Grand skit is probably our most popular one as far as being.  That is the greatest skit I've ever heard.  That one's been sent all over the world, and it comes back to us like, dudes, you've got  to check out this prank someone did, because, I don't know, maybe through the computer you  can't tell it's our voices or something.  I don't know.  Because they send it to us and go, man, you guys should do something like this.  Listen to how funny it is.  And I write back, idiot, listen close. 
[00:29:00]  It's our voices.  Yeah, Rick informed me of something about Napster that I forgot.  I was reading about this.  The way it works is the Napster program scans your hard drive for sound files that can  be shared and puts it up on a lid.  You're actually accessing somebody's hard drive when you download some of this stuff.  No kidding.  So it's a little creepy, you know?  Before you know it, you'll be able to just get in there and, hey, look at what I found,  or put stuff on his hard drive that he might not want on there.  No kidding. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  A little creepy.  All right, Jim, thank you.  Hey, guys, can I ask you a favor quick?  Yeah.  I can't give you a ride in here.  I know it's not Friday, but can I give a big FU out to CW Post?  What did they do to you?  They beat us Saturday.  I played for New York Tech.  Lacrosse.  And because we lost, they're going to the championship now.  Wow, that deserves a big FU.  Yeah, big FU out to Post.  All right, man.  We have a lot of fans at CW Post, though.  Oh, yeah?  I'm just kidding.  All right, guys.  You called first, so we'll support you guys. 
[00:30:00]  Syndication on the ground.  All right, Jim, thank you.  Later.  Artie's got a little more on Napster before we move on.  Artie, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  I got about 200 files from Napster, and it's like Anthony was saying, that you access from  other people's hard drive.  Yeah.  And the one thing that's a little bit odd, too, and it's like, you know, you get a little  bit pissed off because you try to tap into somebody who has a T3 connection, you know,  so it takes like two seconds to download as opposed to like a 56K.  Nine times out of ten, those people will knock you off.  And it's like, you know, well, how did you get your files? 
[00:30:30]  You're probably sucking them off for someone else, you know?  And it's like you can't even like host off of that.  People getting pissed off already.  It's like the old days when you used to have to get on AOL in the chat rooms to trade porno.  Trade GIFs.  Remember that?  Trade the GIFs.  You get in the room, anybody got any GIFs?  Any GIFs?  Any GIFs?  Come on.  And another thing.  It's just like, do you have a burner?  Do you have a CD burner?  Who doesn't?  Who doesn't, right?  You could do the same thing.  You don't even need Napster.  Right.  Like two of my friends have like 300 CDs. 
[00:31:00]  I make like compilations all the time.  Yeah.  It really is getting crazy out there with that.  I haven't bought a CD in about two years.  Oh, see, that's what the record companies don't want to hear.  They don't want to hear that at all.  My brother's pretty much opening up his own record store from his apartment.  He's making his own mixes of every single band he knows.  All right, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Yo, Gladiator was awesome.  Yeah, we liked it.  It was really good.  Cool.  Definitely was.  Take care, guys.  All right, man. 
[00:31:30]  Let's go to Ferris.  Ferris, what's going on?  Hey, Ferris.  Yeah.  How are you?  All right.  All right, you're on the air.  Let's go.  Okay, cool.  Listen, I heard an interview with Lars.  Lars.  Lars recently.  And he said that he's not pissed off.  He still wants people to trade Metallica stuff over the Internet for free.  He's not mad at that.  No.  This company is making money off them.  They've got to be making money somewhere if they're sponsoring a tour for Limp Bizkit and Cypress Hill.  I don't know how they're making money because it doesn't cost anything. 
[00:32:00]  You log on.  I don't know if they have advertisers on the site that they're making money through indirectly.  Yeah, they don't know what they're doing either, but they said somehow they're making money off this.  If they weren't making money, he's got no problem with it.  Let's see.  Steve C. checking in.  As long as you have MP3 files in a certain folder on your computer, anyone using Napster can see whatever someone else might have on your hard drive in that folder.  If it happens to be an entire Metallica CD, then someone could grab the whole thing.  Wow.  So whatever you have in that folder, that's a little frightening. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Especially when most people don't know when they download something where the hell it goes.  Yeah.  I downloaded it.  Where did it go?  Where is it?  Guys, can I add something else?  Yes.  Listen, is Spaz running the phone today?  Yeah, he's back doing his job today.  Okay.  I'm surprised I got through today.  Guys, I can't tell you how many times I've called.  I don't want to start a Spaz rampage, but, you know, I called in.  Remember when you wanted to know from people what happened at the corn show and everyone was just saying, corn rock, man.  Yeah, yeah.  I tried to call up 30 times. 
[00:33:00]  Did you know that they did a Slayer song during the concert?  Did you know that Staines was a call?  See, that's why Spaz screams.  He does a very good job.  Who cares?  You know who that was on the phone up here?  Who?  Kevin!  I was waiting.  I was wondering when we were going to get that call.  Let me know.  Let me know.  Come on.  Come on.  We should have a contest.  How many times Timmy was said in that episode?  Every 30 seconds. 
[00:33:30]  Come on.  Come on.  Vinny, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Great.  I'm calling from Florida.  I just wanted to let you know I turned my whole fraternity on to you guys.  From Florida?  Down here at FIT?  Yeah.  And the word is spreading, like you said, all over the United States.  So are you?  Down in Florida.  We love you.  So you're listening right now through the internet?  Yeah.  I got eight, ten guys coming in and out of the room listening to you guys.  All right.  That rocks.  Got to say hi to you guys down there in Florida. 
[00:34:00]  What school?  FIT in Florida.  It's through the technology.  That's cool, man.  I'm from New York, though, so I knew about you guys.  I'm from Long Island, but I'm going to school down here in Florida.  That's the burnout school, isn't it?  Yeah, it pretty much is.  Say hello to all of our affiliates right now, and especially our affiliate down there in  Florida.  Thank you.  Yeah, tell Bubba the love sponge he sucks.  All right, guys.  All right, Vinny.  Big fat slob of a radio host that really blows. 
[00:34:30]  Cool.  Florida.  That is pretty much running Florida.  We'll move into the Florida area.  We're like a syndicate, a mafia syndicate.  Bump them off.  We're going to bump them off one city at a time.  Is it true Jay Moore's going to be on Politically Incorrect tonight?  Oh, really?  That's what a bunch of people are saying?  Is that taped or a live show?  That's what I'm wondering.  I guess they tape it, but, you know, same day or more or less, whatever, within a few  hours of running it.  Interesting.  So Jay's on Politically Incorrect tonight. 
[00:35:00]  You're going to have to watch that.  God, I hope he makes some stupid reference that has something to do with our show today.  Yeah, that would be kind of cool.  That'll make a lot of people laugh.  And people want to know if we're doing anything at Raw's War tonight at the Coliseum.  Raw's War is in our backyard tonight at the Coliseum.  We have a bunch of people going from the radio show, and they're going to be giving out the  brand new Wow stickers.  I guess that's the Wow sticker stop for today.  Nice.  I believe Psycho Mark and the gang are going to be leaving in the next 20 minutes.  They're going to be, you know, tooling around the parking lot, giving out the Wow stickers, 
[00:35:30]  and then hopefully after the event they'll still be around giving them out.  So look for the Wow van, okay?  Yeah.  And, of course, plenty of signage.  We love the signs there in Raw.  Right.  Very funny.  Right.  Maybe some of Spaz's quotes from his episode with, where does he live now?  Slotsburg.  Slotsburg.  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever.  Slotsburg.  Whatever you guys come up with, it'll make us laugh as we watch.  Okay, Beba.  Beba. 
[00:36:00]  I love you, Beba.  Beba.  Beba.  I was getting all pissed off in the office.  I was just calling him Beba the whole time.  And he's like, what?  He's all pissed.  Shut up.  What are you calling me that for?  I'm sorry, Beba.  Beba.  It's Beba.  Beba.  Beba.  Isn't that right, Spaz?  Come on.  Spazer.  Spazer. 
[00:36:30]  So, yes.  And we need a little more support on Long Island.  It's our damn freaking hometown.  Yeah.  Please.  Don't really see any wows on the LIA.  I was all over the LIA this weekend.  I've been seeing a lot out there, though.  I saw a guy with Connecticut Vanity Place that said wow.  Really?  And it's so funny.  You get behind one of these guys that have a really good sign.  Yeah.  And you just start beeping and going crazy.  And they look at you like, you're a dude, man.  I don't want to see nothing.  But you're trying to say, no, man. 
[00:37:00]  Hey, yeah, come on.  It's Opie.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You know, I need a sign for the car.  Because I just lose it.  Especially when I see a vanity plate that says wow.  My mission now is when I see somebody with the window cling.  The window cling.  I saw a couple of those.  I try to pull up next to him and give him a good sticker, you know.  Give him the real deal.  You got one of those dopey window clings.  You guys, if you have a wow window cling, it's part of the old regime.  We'd really appreciate it if you just got it off your car.  Yeah.  It's an embarrassment, that thing.  You need to get a brand new wow sticker. 
[00:37:30]  You can send in a self-addressed stamped envelope or make a homemade sign, okay?  Yeah.  Do we need to give out the address?  Oh, it's so long.  Where's the sloth?  Has he made it into work yet?  The sloth.  The number of a magazine, look.  Where's the sloth?  Oh, my God.  What?  Are you talking about Earl?  Yeah, the sloth.  The sloth.  This is right here.  The three-toed sloth.  Oh, my God. 
[00:38:00]  The sloth moves very slowly.  He's got so many self-addressed stamped envelopes on his damn desk that he has to get out immediately.  He's never in here, either.  When does he start work?  I hear he starts work at three now?  The sloth?  What?  Yeah.  Three to...  What does he work?  Three to five?  No, he's at 430.  Is that what EOE's up to these days?  Oh, Jesus.  What the hell is he...  What is it...  And ever since he's gotten that cubicle now where no one could see him, he's never there. 
[00:38:30]  Occasionally, I peek back to see if he's there.  He's never there.  Yeah.  He has the hidden cubicle.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So...  So...  The sloth.  Is the sloth here today?  He just came in from Slothville.  He just came in?  All right.  If you want to send a self-addressed stamped envelope in for the brand new WOW sticker,  there's a huge box.  It's just stuffed.  There's got to be thousands in there.  I'm not answering.  It's fine.  The sloth isn't answering?  The sloth!  That's horrible.  Uh, just, uh, just send a self-addressed stamped envelope. 
[00:39:00]  Write a tension WOW sticker.  The address is WNEW.  Attention Sloth!  888.  Yeah.  Attention Sloth.  WNEW.  888 7th Avenue.  10th floor.  New York, New York.  1-0-1-0-6.  All right.  Hey, Psycho Mark, aren't you leaving to go to the Coliseum for Raw's War with the WOW stickers  and the WOW van and stuff?  Yeah, I'm just icing down the Budweiser's.  Dude, you've got to leave soon, because that's the biggest nightmare commute ever. 
[00:39:30]  Goddamn, gets out of this stinking town.  Oh, that's right.  The President, yeah, that's why traffic was all effed up on the way in.  Every gas breather in the world is here.  You see him sitting in there for the Cardinal?  Yeah.  You see him?  Oh, they're finally moving the casket.  Oh.  It was hysterical.  I'm watching, and they kept going to him, and he's got the somber face on.  You know, because if Clinton's at a happy event, he puts the happy Clinton face on.  Yeah.  If he's at a somber event, like the Cardinal's death, he puts the somber face on.  Yeah.  But you know damn well it's the same Clinton inside. 
[00:40:00]  He's there like, hey, I wonder when I could get out of here, go to Flash Dancers.  Maybe I could see.  Maybe down 9th Avenue, get me a whore.  Yeah, he wants to sneak out of there.  I want a bank.  All right, come on there, you with the funny hat.  Wave the smoker out.  Say some of that mumbo jumbo, whatever you're talking about.  Let's go.  Oh, yes.  And his wife, she's not human.  I'm convinced she's an alien.  Yeah.  She's got the eyes.  You guys see the eyes?  Yeah, Louis Black says, you know, she's just not there. 
[00:40:30]  She has no emotion.  She was standing right behind Clinton, and I was wondering if she had her strap-on on.  She was behind him, and she's rocking, like, forward and backwards, and it looked like she was railing Bill.  I got the strap, and then Rudy.  Maybe those wacky hats turn her on.  Rudy right next to her.  Well, they're phallic symbols.  They got big penis heads on their, on their, yeah.  Oh, no, that's just...  Oh, no, come on.  What are they doing?  They're just, they're showing some poor little kid with one leg walking up the aisle? 
[00:41:00]  Timmy.  Timmy.  Timmy.  Yeah, it's a kid with one leg and crutches, and then they got George Bush is in there.  It looked like he was, I don't know what he was doing here.  I think he was yawning, but it looked like he was convulsing.  Like there's no one of those big yawns, because everyone's tired.  No one's...  Oh, look at the little Timmy kid.  Timmy.  There's one leg.  Oh, no, come on. 
[00:41:30]  He's pointing.  He doesn't know where to go.  He's hopping on one foot.  That's not right.  Why are they putting him on there?  All right.  The cardinal, his casket being carried out.  A lot more, a lot more pallbearers to the front of the casket where his big head is residing  as they carry him out.  Why are they clapping?  I don't understand that.  Because it's over.  It took like forever.  They're clapping.  You don't clap for a dead person. 
[00:42:00]  They do that all the time.  They're applauding.  You see the Academy Awards where they show all the people that have died in the last  year, Anthony?  Yeah.  And the people give applause.  They start applauding the dead people.  They're applauding the dead.  And then some of them get a bigger applause than others because they're more important  dead people than others.  That is so mental.  Why do you applaud dead people?  Hey, Al.  Let's say we grab a couple of hookers after this, Al.  You just know it's a matter of time before you see a wow sign on TV. 
[00:42:30]  All the TV crews outside.  Oh, my God.  I was watching in Times Square.  They had some people because they have the Jumbotron out there and they would broadcast  in the funeral live in Times Square.  Yeah.  Like any of the rubes that are in Times Square want to stand there.  Well, they probably do.  Look at the big TV shit.  Goddamn, that's a big TV.  And they had a bunch of people.  They had a bunch of people broadcasting live.  So we're watching in the office and I'm just like, please a wow.  Please a wow.  And I saw some homie walk up and start throwing gang signs. 
[00:43:00]  That's always a funny thing.  Yo, bro.  After my homies.  Yo, geez.  He's got like he's throwing up gang signs.  Oh, brother.  All right.  We got to take a quick break, Ant.  But the funeral continues.  Hey, Al.  Hey, Al.  It gets all boring in there.  So Clinton and Gore have to have fun.  Al, Al, pull my finger.  Come on, Al.  Pull my finger.  And it looks like George Bush, the last eight years, we're a little rough on him, huh?  Man, we haven't seen him in public a lot in the last eight. 
[00:43:30]  No.  Well, Reagan isn't there, though.  Yeah, that's true.  He doesn't want to be reminded of what's in store for him in a month or two.  But, I mean.  Yes, my casket.  His wife looks exactly the same, though.  Mr. Gorbachev, get out of that box.  All right.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  Our phone number, 212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. 
[00:44:00]  Hey, Anthony, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Yes, Opie.  Mother's Day is this Sunday, May 14th, of course.  Make Mom happy by sending her a bear grand gift from the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  I sent one to my mom.  She got it in between crashing the car.  And she loved it.  Oh, my God.  She absolutely loved it.  Really?  Yeah.  God.  She thought it was beautiful.  And she thought it was very thoughtful.  I'm not even going to get into it.  And then she took the car out for a ride and took out our mailbox and our plans. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, okay.  Ouch.  What if they're sharing with everybody?  I understand, Opie.  Anyways, Anthony, Mother's Day, this Sunday.  Yes.  This is a perfect gift, isn't it?  I got a wonderful Vermont Teddy Bear from my mom.  And it's in the office right now because I couldn't send it to her because she's in Tahiti. 
[00:45:00]  No, I know why.  Why?  Because you didn't know where to send it.  Well, no, because she wasn't going to be there for Mother's Day.  I also didn't have her address on hand.  I don't have my mom's address.  You don't know your mom's address?  No, she hasn't lived there her whole life like your family.  Jeez.  But she's...  Your family, one of the original settlers of Centipole.  For God's sake.  Yeah, pretty much.  But she's been at this house for a few years now.  I know.  I just don't know the numbers.  I know the name of the street.  I just didn't know the numbers. 
[00:45:30]  You got the strangest brain, man.  I can't remember, like, numbers.  The phone numbers.  Like, answers.  Ant doesn't know my phone number.  Every time you're...  I do now.  You want to play that game, I'll say it right over the air.  Oh, you do know it?  Yeah.  Okay.  I know.  Finally?  Yeah.  Because you would have to look it up.  All right, look.  No, I believe it.  All right, I believe you.  Yes, that's it.  That is it.  Think how the spaz cam wasn't on.  Mm-hmm.  But it's weird.  You don't know phone numbers.  You don't know addresses.  But you could, like, come up with a line from a Little Rascals episode that Eric wants like that. 
[00:46:00]  I'm like Rain Man.  That's bizarre.  But anyway, Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  This really is a great gift.  And it's not too late to get one of these bears to your mother or your grandmother or something.  Right, Anthony?  Mm-hmm.  Just call a friendly bear counselor at 1-800-829-BEAR.  That's 1-800-829-BEAR.  They make it real easy for you.  They've got over 100 bears to choose from, like the angel mom or mama's boy with a heart-shaped mom tattoo.  There's even a pregnancy bear and a new red-hot mama bear, Anthony.  Really?  Which we were checking out. 
[00:46:30]  They also have tailor-made bears for your mom's occupation, like the nurse bear, the teacher bear, the gardening bear, the reckless driver bear.  Sorry, we're not allowed to make up names for bears, so they drown on that.  I guess they don't have the reckless driving bear, Anthony.  No, they don't, Anthony.  Okay.  Send a bear-gram gift.  It's a creative alternative to flowers.  And your mom will love her bear forever, Anthony.  Yeah.  Call 1-800-829-BEAR or shop online at vermontteddybear.com. 
[00:47:00]  The creative alternative to flowers for Mother's Day and graduation, too, Ann.  That's 1-800-829-BEAR.  Tell them Opie and Anthony sent you.  Let me let you ladies in on something.  Opie and Anthony.  Their brains are in their pants.  1-0-2-7.  WNW.  2-1-2-7-5-7.  1-0-2-7.  Here's our phone line.  Nick's look horrible yesterday, Anthony. 
[00:47:30]  You check out that game.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  No, I'm lying.  I didn't check it out.  All I saw was, I think it was Patrick Ewing.  Yeah.  Did he tie the game up at some point?  I think so.  And then they lost anyway.  Yeah.  Morning got the best of us yesterday.  Yes.  Yes.  And as we speak of sports, congratulations to Bob Shepard.  50 years as the PA announcer at the stadium.  Yeah.  What?  50 years. 
[00:48:00]  50 years.  Jesus Christ.  Imagine working at one place for 50 years.  He sounds every year of it, too, man.  No.  No.  Oh, come on.  No, no, no.  He looks every year of it.  The voice hasn't changed in 50 years.  I know, but...  No, come on.  He sounds...  The voice has not changed in 50 years.  I'm telling you.  All right.  I don't know.  I seem to remember years back and sounding a little better.  He just sounds like a very old man.  Hmm.  What does ONA think of Scott Muni?  Oops.  Paul, what's going on? 
[00:48:30]  We lost him all.  Number one in my one-hour show.  Virgin.  Where is he?  Yeah.  David Hinckley.  David Hinckley, who writes for the Daily News, does the radio column.  Yeah.  He really needs to start listening to the radio in this town.  I don't know what he's doing.  He writes the stupidest, most boring columns.  Saturday, Daily News, I guess.  Something through there.  There's a little radio section for the size of a postage stamp. 
[00:49:00]  And he has a magnifying glass.  But it's talking about how Scotzo...  You know, hey, we've got to give Scotzo his props.  Congrats, Scotzo.  His one-hour show that he's doing.  That's taped.  Yeah.  That's a taped one-hour show.  His one-hour tape show.  Is number one with men 25, 54.  54.  Okay.  Yes, Scotzo.  Okay.  And then it went on.  And I didn't even understand this thing by saying that we were also number one men 25, 54. 
[00:49:30]  Well, he's on before us.  That's what they're...  Yeah, they're not on at the same...  We're not on at the same time.  That's what they're getting at.  They're like, Scott Muni is number one for his one-hour show, men 25 to 54.  Yeah.  Coincidentally, O&A, who took over for Scott Muni.  Right.  They're also number one men 25 to 54.  And then it had a quote from Scotzo.  He said, uh...  Come in.  No, he didn't say that.  Virgin.  No, he didn't say that either.  No, he didn't say that either.  He said, uh...  Well, no hard feelings, but it's good to be on top again. 
[00:50:00]  What?  And I'm like, what?  What?  I had to read it like 50 times and I still don't get what the hell he's talking about.  No hard feelings for what?  I know.  I don't know.  He's on top of my game.  He's on top of his game.  Can we break it down and see how I did every minute?  Let's figure this out, though.  Okay.  If you have a one-hour radio show...  Okay.  ...and you play...  Let's be conservative.  15 minutes of commercials in an hour. 
[00:50:30]  Come in.  All right?  Yeah.  So that's 45 minutes of show.  Okay.  You play in that 45 minutes eight records.  Okay.  That average four minutes each.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right?  Mm-hmm.  So he probably plays more than, let's say, ten records.  Yeah.  Average is 40 minutes.  40 minutes.  Yeah.  For that.  15 minutes for the commercials.  So we're up to 55 minutes.  He talks for five minutes a day.  The whole time.  Yeah.  It's very funny. 
[00:51:00]  It's just...  A typical break is like,  Heh.  And stick around for some credence.  That's it.  Dead air.  And then you might get lucky to hear something like this.  Oh, Samuel.  All right.  All right. 
[00:51:30]  Virgin.  Yeah.  So congratulations to Mr. Muni.  Doing well there, Anthony.  Here he goes.  But yeah, Hinkley.  My God.  Does he listen to the radio?  I don't think so, to be honest with you.  Because he finds the most boring stuff to write about in that damn column of his.  You know it?  Yeah.  Stations, honestly, I was born and raised in New York, lived most of my life in New York,  and he mentions radio stations, and we're in the business, that I've never heard of. 
[00:52:00]  Flat out, I've never heard of.  Yeah.  Guys celebrating 30 years at a station you've never heard of.  And then talking about like a Broadway show tune station that's on some CB band.  I don't know.  I don't think he pays attention to like the radio that the majority of the city listens to.  We need some young, hip guy that listens to a lot of radio in New York to write the column.  Because there's some really interesting stories on a daily basis in New York radio. 
[00:52:30]  Well, you wouldn't know it by reading his column, certainly.  Vinny from Rosdale.  Thank you that you're sending Psycho Mark instead of Earl for Raw's war tonight at the Coliseum.  If Earl left today, he would be there for the Islanders' season opener.  Rick from Jersey.  One, the sloth had to fill in for the best of like a Saturday night.  Come on!  And do a promotion Sunday, and you expect him at work on time on Monday?  What promotion was he doing? 
[00:53:00]  I don't know.  Maybe the Hoboken Fair?  Earl!  I heard there was a ton of people down there.  Fill in for like us.  Is that still on this station?  Yeah, they had to kind of...  Oh, my God.  They had to kind of make a compromise.  Oh, no.  So we're stuck with them once or twice a week for now.  Aren't we supposed to get Lydia or something for the weekends?  Lydia!  Where's Lydia?  Put Lydia!  They want to have us do a best of show on the weekends.  On the weekends?  We ain't doing it.  No.  I think we're going to have to get the agent involved. 
[00:53:30]  Do they really want to do that now?  Yeah.  I think a little over-saturation isn't a good thing.  Yeah, that's not a smart thing.  They're just being lazy.  They've got to find other people.  But instead of finding other people to do the weekend shifts, they're like,  yeah, why don't we just have the current lineup do best-up shows for the weekend.  Guys, we'll call you a slapping and whacking.  Now, you need some local talk talent to take over the station on the weekends.  Just take it over.  Well, maybe that's what Earl was doing.  Instead of that tired old rock that I'd tune in to hear. 
[00:54:00]  Because, I mean, the station's starting to sound a little exciting during the week when you say it.  Like a talk station.  And then you're like, oh, I want to tune it in on the weekend.  And it's just like, yeah, just the same old classic rock crap.  Well, maybe they'll do something about that.  No, I ain't playing any Chet Riton.  Oh, God damn.  I'll shove that right up your kiki. 
[00:54:30]  Your kiki.  Well, that's the new word.  Shannon came up with it.  Yeah, did you see those pictures?  Instead of balloon knot, it's kiki.  Yeah, the pictures of Shannon's hot wax episode is up on the unofficial Opian Anthony website.  It looks like she has some rare disease.  I know.  She's got green and red dots all over her.  All over from the candle wax that we dripped all over her body.  Her most intimate of areas.  And Rick got a really nice ass shot.  A very nice ass shot.  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  So check it out for yourself.  Foundrymusic.com.  We've got to take a quick break, and we're going to regroup.  We'll be back.  Our phone number is 212-757-1027.  I feel stupid.  Oh, so stupid.  I feel stupid and dumb and dumb.  Opie and Ashley.  We've got a smile on our face and a head up our ass.  212-757-1027 is our phone line. 
[00:55:30]  Instant feedback coming in like crazy.  Frank from Manhattan.  Oh, and A, this morning I took a cab to work and it drove down Fifth Avenue.  All the news vans were lined up on either side of the street, and I had to laugh because all the anchors were standing on the top of the vans.  Gee, I can't imagine what they were afraid of.  You know, every head of every news department gave their crew some serious marching orders. 
[00:56:00]  If I see a goddamn wow sign on our air during the Cardinal's funeral, you better jump in the grave after him because that's the only place you'll be safe.  Huh.  It was great.  They don't make a move without thinking of the wow ambush.  Syndication underground.  Frank.  I think I saw a wow sticker.  Someone slapped it on the Cardinal's casket as they were firing it.  Alex, Adriel.  Yikes.  We haven't had a wow on live TV lately.  I think they're on to us a little bit.  They're a little smarter.  Yeah.  It's going to be a little harder to get them, but they'll let their guard down. 
[00:56:30]  They always do.  Let's let them rip, man.  They always do.  All right.  Let's go back to the phones here.  Garrow?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  How are you, Garrow?  Good, good.  Just graduated from C-Hall this morning.  Oh, congratulations.  Yeah, our commencement speaker was the one and only Tom Brokenjaw.  No.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it was horrible.  First time minutes were so-so.  He started to talk about a couple things, but just went on forever and ever and ever.  Did he have any sense of humor?  We were heckling him from the seats. 
[00:57:00]  Did he try to joke or anything?  Yeah, he did.  He tried a couple things.  We were just like so out of it.  Always good to.  Always good to start with a little, little joke.  Yeah, it was like he, you could see he was like yawning on the, on the podium and stuff  before he came out.  We were just like, screw you, leave, bro.  We just want you to, we want you gone.  He's the sleepiest guy ever.  Ever, ever, ever.  Did he have something to do with the school or did they just, like, throw it on?  He got a honorary degree.  Well, they all do.  Honorary degree. 
[00:57:30]  Why?  Why did he do this guy?  Tom Brokaw, English and Apple News, here at Seaton's Ball.  I just want to tell all the students, stick with your studies and what you're doing, and  you could someday be like me.  Tom Brokaw.  Tom?  Yeah.  It's a big day for you.  You're doing the graduation speech, but you seem really, really out of it today.  Well, I was covering the death of the Cardinal.  Oh, you were?  Many hours before the speech. 
[00:58:00]  It sounds like you might have been at a frat house last night and stayed up too late doing,  like, cake stands or something.  Well, you're on to me.  I was at one of the many frat houses around Seaton Hall University, and I was doing some  cake stands.  Yeah.  With some of the students.  Yeah.  And, of course, there was some drunken co-ed we like to call free meat when they pass out.  And the boys in the fraternity were kind enough to let Tom Brokaw get the first dibs on her. 
[00:58:30]  Tom?  Yeah.  Besides sounding really drowsy, there's writing all over your forehead and stuff.  All those little sons of bitches.  What's that all about?  Well, I fell asleep after I banged the co-ed.  Actually, it wasn't a co-ed.  It was our own Katie Couric, who was passed out getting nailed by line after line of frat  brothers.  Yeah.  Quite the scene. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, but you're not explaining the writing on your...  Yes.  Oh, I fell asleep, and I guess some of the little hooligans wrote on my forehead.  What does it say?  Give me a mirror.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, you better look in the mirror, because I can't even repeat it in the mirror.  Let me see.  What does that mean? 
[00:59:30]  You're reading it backwards.  It says Tom is gay.  Tom is gay?  Yes, that's what it says.  It says no wonder I was getting funny looks at the diner when we all went for a little  breakfast after the hospital.  You should have seen Katie Couric quite in the sperm bank when everyone was done with  her.  Just line after line of students.  And, of course, all of them listened to the Opie and Anthony show, because after they finished 
[01:00:00]  up, each and every one said, look what I did to you again.  Tom Brokamp, this is the Nightly News.  Hardy, Hardy, here at Seton Hall.  Many bong hits last night, Opie.  Yeah.  Many bong hits.  And then, of course, Katie, her butt up in the air, getting slapped with many a yam bag.  Fascinating. 
[01:00:30]  I don't know how she was able to sit on the news program this morning.  Yeah.  Well, it looks like you had a great time at Seton Hall.  Lots of fun.  Seton Hall, I'd like to thank everybody, especially the whores.  Tom Brokamp, NBC Nightly News.  We went on a little panty raid after that, Opie.  Oh, yeah?  A little panty raid.  I got my wick wet once again.  Yeah, well, you got like a wet spot on the front of your pants.  Yeah.  I don't know what that's about, but... 
[01:01:00]  I was going all night.  You should have seen me at the rave later on doing some X.  I was almost coherent.  You were doing some X, huh?  Tom Brokamp, NBC Nightly News.  Okay.  Well, thanks, Tom.  I think he crashed out finally.  What a partier.  Commencement speeches.  Tom Brokamp.  An honorary degree.  I hate that.  They get the honorary degrees. 
[01:01:30]  Bill Cosby's got like 20 of them.  I can't even get an honorary degree from my high school.  Bunch of bastards.  I heard Rick on the phone once.  What?  No, he just wants an honorary diploma.  It's just an honorary high school diploma from John Glenn.  He was talking to your old high school?  Yeah, and they're just like, no.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Bastards.  Come on, man.  You've made something of your life.  I'm the pride of John Glenn, you mother effers. 
[01:02:00]  Let me in.  Those hallowed halls.  You're the most famous person to come out of John Glenn, I think.  I think so.  You'd have been the most famous out of Harborfields if it wasn't for Mariah Carey.  Mariah Carey.  There's a big difference right there, too, huh?  But John Glenn, I was wondering, Elwood, it's like it could have been a guy that has like  a small part in NYPD Blue that went to my high school.  No, it's Mariah Carey.  I can't think of one person that came out of John Glenn High School that's famous.  Not a one.  That's even, because I don't even consider myself famous. 
[01:02:30]  You know, I have a bit of a recognition here in New York.  Great.  But, I mean, the other people in John Glenn have not, I mean, I've never heard of anybody  that even comes that close to John Glenn.  Not like a Mariah Carey, Opie.  Like your Harborfields.  Where she goes back to her school to perform.  You know, I made the call.  She gave something back, Opie.  What are you doing?  I made a call to Harborfields High School.  Did you?  I want to go back, and they didn't want anything to do with me, or you, for that matter. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, what the hell is wrong with them?  I think I'm like half a credit short, because I didn't climb the rope enough in gym class,  and they didn't give me my diploma.  So I had to go through life with the scarlet letter of no diploma, Opie, a high school dropout.  But you are an expert.  At what?  Air conditioning.  Yeah, see?  Yeah, I did.  See, I went on.  I got, no, I don't have no good enough diploma yet.  What was I going to get a GED for?  Let me tell you people.  Those are the dumbest friggin' things you ever want to get in your life. 
[01:03:30]  If you didn't make it through high school and get your diploma, just write it off.  Who cares?  You think an employee's going to go, oh, you dropped that high school.  Oh, but you got the GED.  That's great.  The great hard questions on a GED.  How to balance a checkbook.  Oh, that's that tough thing called subtraction.  Whew.  The good enough diploma.  Yeah, like Chris Rock said.  Yeah.  GED.  Good enough diploma.  Now I can go to college.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Now I got my GED. 
[01:04:00]  Now I can go to college.  Someone was saying, didn't Boomer go to John Glenn?  No, no.  Boomer went to my elementary school, Timber Point Elementary School, but I never went to  the high school over there in East Islip.  I was moving around like a, we were like friggin' nomads when I was a kid.  We were all over Long Island.  East Islip, Central Islip, Huntington.  Why did you move around so much, Tim?  I don't know.  Papa's having a hard time keeping a house.  It was a little rough. 
[01:04:30]  It's like, hey, Dad, what's the matter?  No job again this week?  Jeez.  But he was in high school.  You know, he had a diploma.  You know, one week he's fixing vending machines.  Next week he's like a private investigator.  The week after that, I don't know what he's doing.  He owns one of the snack carts on the LIA.  I don't know what it was, but we were moving every year.  Every year.  It was like, oh, pack the crap up again.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Get the U-Haul.  And it was never long moves. 
[01:05:00]  It was like, all right, now we're moving from Central Islip to East Islip.  Oh, good.  That's good.  Nice 10-minute move, but we've got to pick everything up, move everything.  So a year later, we're moving again, back to Huntington.  I moved back to Huntington.  I went to kindergarten at a school called Cuba Hill Elementary School.  I know where that is.  Sure.  Then, in sixth grade, after this journey around Long Island, we came back.  And I was back in kindergarten.  Back in kindergarten. 
[01:05:30]  I never went one grade up.  Back into Cuba Hill Elementary School in sixth grade.  And I knew everybody, but they didn't know me.  And I came in and I was like, I know that guy.  I know that guy.  I know her.  I know him.  And they didn't know me.  So I was walking up to people and just going, hey, how are you doing?  Yeah.  Hey, who are you?  And I was like, oh, wow, nice.  You're growing boobies.  Isn't that nice?  But we were moving all the time.  D-Von Dudley went to John Glenn?  Who's D-Von Dudley?  Oh, one of the Dudley boys?  No.  Stop it.  Is that true?  Uh, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Hey.  What's up?  Not much.  D-Von Dudley from John Glenn High School.  No way.  Yes, he did.  I have a couple friends that actually knew him real well.  He used to walk around the high schools with a Hulk Hogan belt on.  Stop it.  Yes, he did.  D-Von Dudley.  One of the Dudley boys.  I want absolute confirmation of that.  D-Von Dudley.  Thank you, Anthony.  Okay.  Bye.  I heard they're from, he's from Long Island, but.  The Dudley boys are from Long Island.  I don't know.  Yeah, so I, why can't I get my diploma? 
[01:06:30]  I'll go there, I'll take a class, I'll go to gym, I'll do some sit-ups, it'll be a laugh,  and you slap me with my sheepskin, for God's sake.  Rick tried.  I'll go up in the field and give a little speech.  I'll give the, was it just, was it just gym, you failed?  Uh, no.  Okay.  Might have been a couple other things.  Maybe social studies.  Social studies?  No, I don't know what it was.  It was because I didn't show up to a lot of classes.  They were, they were, they were, like, major league boring.  They were getting in your way. 
[01:07:00]  In the way of my pot smoking.  What did you do, Bill?  What?  The principal knew who you were.  Of course they know.  I was in there every day.  I had problems.  He knows exactly who you are, but they don't do that.  How come they don't do that?  There's no law.  There's no rule.  It's an honorary degree.  It's not like you can do something with it.  Yeah, what, what am I going to go, some job and go, hey, I'd like to apply.  Here's my diploma.  You know.  Any other job I had, I used my school that I went to out in California. 
[01:07:30]  Do you even, I would just write it down.  It's like high school.  Okay, Dana Hills High School out in California.  What are they, on the phone?  Hello, Dana Hills?  I need confirmation that Anthony actually went there.  I got a college degree, and they never asked me.  Has one person ever asked you for your degree or diploma or anything?  No, not a job.  They never asked for the high school diploma or the college diploma.  Especially like a dopey-ass job like this.  I had regular, what do you need any kind of education for? 
[01:08:00]  I had regular jobs and stuff.  Yeah.  Throughout my radio career, they never asked.  Never.  And some of the jobs, I'm on the computer program for a while.  See?  They never asked me about my college education.  They never asked you?  They just assumed, because I was applying for the job.  I went into the wonderful world of the air conditioning installation, and no, before you  started, I didn't install that air conditioning system there, that the six people died.  In Roslyn?  In Roslyn.  Yeah, when I had one of my jobs, oops, I hooked the flue up to the, one of the fence.  No, and no one asked me for a diploma. 
[01:08:30]  You're bringing your diploma.  But goddammit, John Glenn, what's your problem?  Stupid school.  The astronaut wouldn't even go there.  You know, they tried to get John Glenn, the astronaut, to, like, say hi to the people,  named the school after him, and even John Glenn said no.  John Glenn wouldn't go there.  They try every year to get that son of a bitch over there.  He flew into space, he won't go to Elwood.  They should change the name of the school, then.  They should. 
[01:09:00]  John Glenn's dissing the people over there.  Stupid school.  Totally dissed them.  I'll travel, like, a few million miles, but I won't go to John Glenn High School.  Hey, James, what's going on, man?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yo, I'm calling from Arizona.  Oh, are you listening underground?  Underground, my friend.  Nice.  Syndication underground.  It's a beautiful thing.  I love you guys.  I go to University of Arizona.  Are you from the New York area?  Yeah, I'm originally from New York.  How did you find out about Syndication Underground? 
[01:09:30]  I did some little research.  Very good.  Yeah, if you do a little research, I mean, there's a ton of places to listen to us on the Internet.  Yeah, a couple of things, you know, I went to, it was like, I mean, the connection wasn't that good.  You know, it's a lot of...  James, we've got guys that are just, like, you know, turning on their radio with their cheap microphone  and broadcasting the show for us over the Internet.  Yeah, it's amazing.  It's great, man.  You know, I love you guys, and it's just, it's good that, you know, that you guys are out there, you know, 
[01:10:00]  spreading the good word around, you know, everybody listening to you.  You know, hopefully one of these days, you know, you get syndicated.  Just, you know, pull that big-nosed bastard out of the water.  All right, James.  Thank you.  Okay, man.  You guys are great.  Bye.  In case you're underground, my friend.  Yes.  Of course, he's talking about that little wooden puppet Pinocchio.  Of course.  Hmm.  Hmm.  All right.  Where is that email?  What?  I just saw one.  I can't find it.  Well, let's take a break, and you can read it next. 
[01:10:30]  Okay.  Is it a good one?  Yeah, it kind of had something to do with something.  Something to do with something.  Yeah.  Oh, there's a radio tease.  Stick around.  Stick around for something to do with something.  Oh, it was the Dudley thing.  Oh, the Dudley thing?  Yeah.  Oh, he went to it.  No, he didn't go to John Glenn.  He did not go to John Glenn.  Okay.  Stupid.  212-757-1027 is our phone line.  I'm just f***ing around.  Here we go.  Opie.  Anthony. 
[01:11:00]  Our genius gets lost.  The crap.  I'm going to cut the crap on this end, I can tell you that.  1027-WNEW.  Hey, Diamond Vision and Dr. Philitoff.  Yes, Opie.  You had the procedure, didn't you?  Yes, I did, Anthony.  Yes, I did.  And do you know from the copy I have in front of me, you could get a Diamond engagement ring?  Oh, we're doing Fidelity Diamond?  I don't know, are we?  Who's wrong, you or me?  Well, we love Diamond Vision, too. 
[01:11:30]  Let me see.  Yeah, you know what?  I f***ed up.  You did?  I f***ed up.  Yes, Fidelity Diamond, Anthony.  Yes.  Are you going to get engaged?  No.  No, I wasn't asking you.  I was asking the people out there.  I got the eye surgery instead of getting engaged.  See?  The eye surgery is more painless.  Yes, in the long run, than getting married.  You're absolutely right.  But you can't stop love.  That's right.  True love, Opie.  Correct.  And no matter what pain and agony some people have been through and are going through, people will still continue to get married. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, but if you get the eye surgery?  Yeah.  Wow.  You see a lot of nice sights out there.  It makes the decision a little harder.  But then again, I'm talking about laser eye surgery, and you're talking about engagement rings.  Right.  Okay.  Well, if you're going to get engaged, you've got to go to Fidelity Diamond, the engagement ring specialists.  They make sure you get the best buy. 
[01:12:30]  You get a complete education on diamonds.  A lot of people don't know that.  You're going to be buying a diamond.  It's going to be a huge investment in your life.  And a lot of people don't know what they're getting.  They go to the department store.  They buy a ring that's already set.  You don't know what's under that setting.  It could be a big black mark in your diamond.  It cuts down on the value.  You pick out your diamond loose at Fidelity Diamond and the setting.  They weigh it and set it while you watch.  None of that slide-of-hand stuff.  And they won't try to chew you down on anything. 
[01:13:00]  Fidelity Diamond.  They do.  They educate you on your diamond.  That's very important.  And if you're going to sell unwanted diamonds, turn them into instant cash.  Fidelity Diamond has a diamond buying service.  Sell diamonds after a breakup, divorce, inheritance, grandma's diamonds, whatever.  Fidelity Diamond orders you the area's highest price.  What if grandma's still alive?  Well, you take the hacksaw to her finger.  I don't know.  Jesus.  If she gives it to you, then you can do that or it leaves it in a will. 
[01:13:30]  Okay.  Something like that.  Alrighty.  But Fidelity Diamond, family-owned, going on their 18th year of business.  Give them a call.  Give Tom Calasino a call, president of Fidelity Diamond, for a confidential appointment.  201-261-6555.  That's 201-261-6555.  Fidelity Diamond.  We're looking for a few good enemas.  What the hell are you talking about? 
[01:14:00]  Dopey and Anthony Show.  Crap, whiz, and vomit.  1027-WNAW.  212-757-1027.  I was reading some email during the break there.  Yeah.  Dear ONA, hello.  I'm the best man at a wedding next month.  Yeah.  And I need to know something.  At the bachelor party, am I supposed to get my buddy some action with strippers?  I would feel like a jerk because I'm friends with the bride, but he's made it pretty clear to me that some action is to be had. 
[01:14:30]  Do I just go along with it and hook something up, or should I do the right thing and throw a PG-13 rated bachelor party?  What's the etiquette on this, or is there any?  Jeremy, 28.  There's a middle ground there.  You could have a bachelor party that isn't PG-13.  Yeah, but see, the guy isn't getting the action.  But see, this guy answered his own question.  It says in this letter, 
[01:15:00]  The bachelor made it pretty clear to me that some action is to be had.  Oh, really?  Then that's what you do.  I hate to say it.  I don't know.  You know what, though?  I don't like those ones where everybody gets on the groom-to-be and makes him do stuff, you know?  You ever see that, like, tie him up blindfolded, and then the chick is doing things? 
[01:15:30]  You know, if you have some whores around for the bachelor party doing some dancing and stuff,  there are people that will just watch, and there are people that will participate.  If he wants to participate, and I wouldn't see why.  I've never been to a bachelor party where I would want to do anything with any of those girls.  You would want to touch them.  I'll watch.  You know, hey, look at what she's doing with the friggin' fire extinguisher.  Great.  It's like, hey, wow, cool, skanky whores.  Yeah.  You sit, you watch, you drink your beers, you laugh with your friends. 
[01:16:00]  You play some cards later, and that's it.  Wow, look what she can do with that wiffle ball bat.  Yeah, right.  But there are guys that, I mean, they're, hey, let's go in the back room.  Oh, God.  Oh, that's disgusting.  No, but it doesn't have to be PG-13 rated.  There's a middle ground there.  You've got to know your bachelor, you know?  Some bachelors, they don't want that type of bachelor party.  They want to go to a Yankee game or a Met game or something, you know? 
[01:16:30]  Right.  Drink some beers with their pals and stuff.  No, it's going to be at the bachelor parties.  Vaginas.  Yeah.  Panises.  Mm-hmm.  Butt sex.  Right.  You've got to watch out.  They come and get you.  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Yes.  Vaginas.  Oh, yeah.  Hey. 
[01:17:00]  Hey.  I think Marco's calling out to you, Anthony.  Hey.  Butt sex.  Hey.  Butt sex.  Hey.  Butt sex.  Come on.  How about that good old nigger work song?  Oh, my God.  Where'd that go from?  Whoops.  I meant it.  That's what happens.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Out of context.  That's not too cool.  Oh, my God.  I meant to do the spaz howl. 
[01:17:30]  I was one short.  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Arr.  See, that's what I was trying to do.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Penises.  Arr.  Arr.  Penises.  No, do butt love.  It'll work better.  Butt sex.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Butt sex.  Ooh.  Butt sex.  Chance.  Ouch.  I mean. 
[01:18:00]  Ouch.  See, here's a guy checking in on instant feedback.  Get the man laid.  It may be his last time.  See, that's...  I mean, believe me, I'm a little jaded on the whole marriage thing.  But if you're going to go into the whole thing, I mean, right from the start,  if you're getting banged at your bachelor party,  you're going to be effing your first week of marriage. 
[01:18:30]  You know what I mean?  Jesus.  Pull her pants down.  That's right, Opie.  Pull her pants down and see what?  Vagina.  Yes, maybe have...  Put your pants down.  Oh, maybe have a little...  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Hey. 
[01:19:00]  Vagina.  Hey.  Bruno.  Bruno.  Turn your radio down, man.  Turn your radio down.  We heard that already.  All right.  What's up, Bruno?  I just want to tell you what the etiquette is.  You know, you go there, you do what you got to do.  At my bachelor party, we had three sets of strippers.  Yeah.  Everybody had a good time.  And when it's over, it's deny, deny, deny.  That's all.  That's pretty simple.  So you suggest that this guy wants some action at his bachelor party, 
[01:19:30]  then the best man should try to get that to happen.  Of course.  You got to do.  Well, if the guy wants it, then he's going to do it.  Okay.  But do you think that's a good thing?  Well, how about...  I mean, if he doesn't want it, how's he going to turn it down when it's in his face?  I don't know.  Some of those skanky hoes.  I mean, you got to be gay to turn it down.  You got to be...  No, no, no.  I disagree.  Some of those skanky hoes, you're just like, Jesus.  Yeah, I don't want anything to do with that. 
[01:20:00]  No, I'm talking class.  I mean, these think they were gorgeous, these girls.  Knockouts.  I'm talking...  They're gorgeous.  Knockouts.  Oh, but that is so skanky, man.  If you saw what they looked like, you would not think of the word skank.  I don't know.  You would think, gorgeous, I got to have this.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Bruno.  I don't know, man.  Thank you.  We got to talk to...  I like that guy.  You too.  We got to talk to Matt.  He's going to a bachelor party in Vegas.  Yeah.  We've all lost Vegas.  Matt, what's going on? 
[01:20:30]  Hey, Opie and Andy.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Well, even...  I'll just put it to you this way.  I read about you guys in Steppin' Out magazine last year, and you guys really kick ass.  Let me tell you.  Oh, my God.  We were on the...  Way back when Chauncey Hayden interviewed you guys.  Yeah.  Not 92, whatever.  You know, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, we...  All right, we'll back the truck up here.  We will not be talking to him anytime soon.  No.  Because he effed up that article so bad, he started misquoting us and stuff, and I yelled 
[01:21:00]  at him after the article came out, and he goes, well, I just wanted to spice up the article  a little bit.  He's someone else's whore, so I guess he was doing some dirty work, but I don't care.  Well, whatever the hell the case was, you guys filled out your shoes just right, and  I'm happy you guys are doing great.  All right.  Because we say a lot of stupid things.  We just don't need reporters, like, misquoting us and inventing quotes to make us look stupid.  Just wait two minutes.  We'll say something really dumb, and you can talk about that.  All right, we'll do it on our own, but we don't need you misquoting us and just inventing 
[01:21:30]  things like he did in that goddamn article.  I'm still pissed to this day about that.  Anyway, Matt, you're going to a bachelor party in Vegas.  We're going to Vegas.  One of my cousins, he's been with this girl for 10 years, and we're going to Vegas because  he wants to live it out in style, I guess, for one week, and I think we're going to go  on the Labor Day weekend, so I'm just psyched about this whole thing.  All right, so what are you telling the bride to be?  I mean, she's got to be like...  Well, it's simple.  We're going to Vegas for a couple of days, and that's it. 
[01:22:00]  We're going to go gambling and whatever happens.  But, you know, the girl trusts the guy just enough to let him go.  You know what I'm saying?  And is this guy going to F when he gets there?  Is he going to F around?  Hello?  Matt?  Matt?  Hello?  Hey.  He's too scared to answer the question.  Matt?  Yeah, I think I'm losing you.  Ah, yeah, right.  You're right there.  We got a perfect signal.  He doesn't want to answer the question.  Yeah, see? 
[01:22:30]  No, see, we can tell if we're losing you or not.  Why get...  He had a perfect signal.  Why get...  He was scared.  Why get married if you're going to F on your bachelor party?  That's what I'm wondering.  Because, like, if you're getting married, it means that you're making this huge commitment.  You're deeply in love with the person.  And the thought of having sex with somebody else wouldn't even enter your mind.  Or it might enter your mind, but you have this commitment that you're going to make to this person. 
[01:23:00]  So just by having sex with somebody else at the bachelor party, it means that you might not totally be serious about this.  This thing that you're going to get caught up in that the cogs keep turning and grinding you into, like, wheat dust.  Like getting caught in the gears of an auger or a combine.  A combine.  I mean, if you're going to do it on your bachelor party, why bother getting married? 
[01:23:30]  Why bother?  I would like the stat on that whole thing.  If you F on your bachelor party, how long before you're Fing during your marriage?  Lauren, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  I wanted to tell you guys, I'm really proud of you for saying you wouldn't sleep with strippers.  Well, the bachelor parties I've been at, it's just our ploy to get chicks.  Yeah, because then you guys love us, and then we take you in the back and slam you in the kiki.  No, but you just proved that there's a line that can be drawn. 
[01:24:00]  Well, I just, yeah.  I mean.  Butt tics.  Ouch.  What?  Oh, no, I'm just laughing.  No, but I mean, that guy that just called and said, oh, but, you know, these girls are beautiful.  These girls are beautiful.  I mean, why are you getting married, you know?  Is this Anthony talking or the plaintiff?  No, it's, you know, just because my marriage didn't work out, it doesn't mean I can't comment on those things. 
[01:24:30]  And that wasn't the reason.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  Lauren, Lauren, is a BJ cheating, though?  Hmm?  Is a BJ cheating?  I don't know.  What about a handy?  What about a handy?  His hand.  No, if you're getting married, I mean, is a BJ cheating?  I don't know.  Vagina.  If you're getting married and you get a BJ at your bachelor party, I don't know, it's questionable.  All right.  But the fact that you said you wouldn't. 
[01:25:00]  What about butt sex?  Butt sex.  Oh, boy.  No, but you guys are the greatest.  All right, Lauren.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, I just think the truth of the matter is if you're banging at your bachelor party,  you're going to be banging during your marriage.  Let's go to Mark real fast.  Mark, what's up?  I agree.  Let me tell you.  You guys hit it right on the head.  If you're going to be screwing at your bachelor party, then it's just, you know, you're writing 
[01:25:30]  off your entire marriage right there.  Yeah.  I mean, I got married seven years ago, and my wife knew that we were going to have, my  wife, I guess at the time she was my girlfriend, but she knew we were going to have strippers  there and stuff, and, you know, you sit in the chair, and they do, like, the lap dances  and humiliate you and this and that.  Right.  And then everyone looks, and they're like, woo-hoo, and it's over.  And you know what?  I get home, and I got home at, like, I don't know, four or five in the morning.  My wife is, like, you know, very playfully, hey, did you touch anybody tonight?  And I didn't. 
[01:26:00]  I was like, no, but some people touched me.  And it was over.  That's it.  And while that's going on, your future father-in-law's in the back room getting butt  sex.  Oh, butt sex.  Yeah, but that seems good.  He doesn't have a daily basis.  He doesn't have to make money.  All right.  Anyway, so that's the way I feel about it, though.  I was not interested.  I was going to marry this woman the next day.  You know, I wasn't interested in.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a little rough.  Yeah.  So, anyway, you got the idea, though.  Stay away.  And my friends were like, yeah.  So when I was the best man for a friend of mine, they were like, hey, you going to get 
[01:26:30]  some hookers?  I was like, no, I'll get some strippers.  They're like, yeah, well, he's going to want some.  And you know what?  He didn't want any.  And we didn't go there.  I like seeing some wacky stuff at the bachelor parties.  That's fun.  Girls that can shoot, you know, ping pong balls and stuff.  Yeah, maybe some talent.  Spectator sports.  But that's it.  It's a spectator sport.  You go to the ball game, you know, you enjoy watching.  You don't go out there to the mountain and try to pitch a few.  I was just going to say that.  You don't test out your split finger, but that's a whole other story.  Girls that can take the toupees. 
[01:27:00]  Clean your glasses.  I've seen that one.  Believe me, you don't want to be doing that before you get married.  You wait 10 years.  And that's exactly it.  You know what?  I've been married seven years, so maybe today, but not seven years ago.  Thanks, fellas.  Good luck.  Signification next leap year.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  A lot of people calling in with their bachelor party stories.  Yeah, we could stay on this for a little longer, okay?  What?  Yeah.  Ouch. 
[01:27:30]  Hey, horrific.  Can I hear it, Timmy, one last time?  Oh, a little loud, a little loud, a little loud.  Butt sex.  Ouch.  Oh, boy.  I need more sounds, though.  I got the spaz howl, the spaz chant.  I got the monkey sex sound effect. 
[01:28:00]  You got all the fun ones, Ed.  Hey, baby.  How you doing, spaz?  Hi, baby.  Butt sex.  Okay, baby.  Hey, baby.  Butt sex.  All right.  We've got to take a break, right?  Yeah.  A lot of great calls on hold here.  We'll go to you guys next.  Stay there.  This is Vince McMahon of the WWF.  And if you love a good cage match, you're going to love Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW. 
[01:28:30]  He's Sacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yes, it works, Opie.  With this heat wave upon us, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  People shedding their clothes.  Ladies, you've got to be careful.  There's a Catch-22 happening on the streets of New York today.  What is it?  Girls licking ice cream.  Boy.  Very, very sexy.  Mmm.  Very erotic.  Mmm.  Skimpy clothes licking ice cream.  Very nice.  Eating those cryogenically frozen ice cream things you get out of the little carts around the park. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, where you chip your tooth, trying to...  Oh, my God.  I wanted a fruit bar, not a piece of granite.  Yeah.  What the hell is this?  Frozen.  But the girls all over Manhattan today, uh, walking the streets licking the ice cream.  But if they're eating ice cream...  If they're eating the ice cream every day, though, that's not cool.  Every once in a while, ladies, you're licking the ice cream, you've got the hot body working very, very nice.  Start licking ice cream every day, you could have a problem.  Yeah, you need the stack or two.  The stack or two will help you keep the weight off, right, Anthony?  Burn it off. 
[01:29:30]  A lot of women walking around the city, uh, almost nude in this weather.  It's very nice to look at, in some cases.  In others...  Even the fatties looking good out there.  Yeah.  A girl that you would not even take a second look at.  Now, let me explain myself.  By June or July, no, the fatties are out of the picture.  But this is like the first...  The first week of good weather.  So you have some skin.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  So even the fatties, just like, wow.  Just a turn on, because you're seeing just stuff you haven't seen in a while on foreign chicks. 
[01:30:00]  So you still have a chance to get the stack or two and slim down before the fatty thing wears off, I hope you.  Oh, yeah.  The fatty thing definitely wears off, because then you get a little picky as the season goes on.  You go to the beaches, you start seeing thong bikinis.  You're like, eh, I want to see more skin than that at this point.  But now, just seeing, like, girls' forearms and stuff.  Oh, look at that.  That was covered up last week.  That's been covered up for the last eight months.  Yeah.  Anyway, yeah, stack or two does three things.  It burns the fat.  It crushes the cravings to snack in between meals.  And it gives you a boost of energy when you're feeling sluggish during the day, Anthony. 
[01:30:30]  It also makes it easier for...  Butt sex.  Yeah.  I don't know about that.  I don't know if the fine people at stack or two want to be associated with the butt sex.  Butt sex.  Drop in, Anthony.  Oh.  Sorry.  I don't know.  All right, so ladies, if you're into butt sex and you want to trim down, you're going to want to call stack or two.  The world's strongest fat burner.  Give them a call.  1-800-LIGHTLINE. 
[01:31:00]  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  We found a girl that can shoot stuff from a private area.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone line.  Hey, we can go back to those phones.  They're just exploding about fashion parties right now. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Is Bridget the Midget coming in tomorrow?  Another midget?  Bridget the Midget.  Oh, the porno midget?  She's not coming in.  She's canceled.  Why?  What happened?  What happened?  I just called her this morning to confirm with her, and she's like, oh, well, you know, somebody wants to pay.  What?  The person that usually takes care of her travel stuff didn't want to take care of it, so she canceled. 
[01:32:00]  Hmm.  Very suspicious.  Did somebody else get involved with our radio show?  Could be.  Another radio station got involved with our radio show?  I didn't say that.  You don't have to say that.  I didn't say anything.  You little fidget.  All right.  Very good.  Huh.  Interesting.  So someone is preventing us from having her on our show. 
[01:32:30]  Sounds like that, doesn't it?  Can you say that much, Rick?  It sounds like that, but I don't know who you're talking about.  I didn't mention anyone.  I just said someone is preventing her from appearing on our show.  Yes, that's what it is.  That's all I need to know.  Thank you.  Oh, okay.  Alan, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Real good.  Hey, I was calling, you know, a few years back, a friend of mine picked me to do the best man for his wedding.  And he wanted to have a wild time, but he didn't want to feel the guilt about it.  So it turns out, I went to a place up in North Jersey, and we found a stripper who found a way to make you do things guilt-free. 
[01:33:00]  What she would do is she would take the best man in the room, and also the groom, and she'd separate you guys.  And what she would do is she'd, you know, get you guys, like, a correction, and she would put...  I'm guilty about it.  Oh, my God.  How's that for guilt-free?  And where's the plastic hollowed-out dung been?  Well, no, the ones she brought to us, actually, were still in the plastic.  Like, she...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  I can case them at home.  It was a little shrink wrap thing.  It was a little shrink wrap, you know, like an amoeuf type stuff. 
[01:33:30]  And...  So you did this thing?  I didn't want to do it because I was involved with somebody at the time I thought I was in love,  and I didn't want the guilt action for them either.  Well, that's just an extra thick condom.  Yeah, that's all it is.  That's all it is.  But, hey, Andy, you know, it's guilt-free.  That's what she said.  You know?  What are you going to do?  Actually, he went ahead and did it, and he's glad he did it.  He said she was fine, though, because that thing was about a foot long, too.  She swallowed the whole thing up like a whole top of the bag.  All right.  Hey, and also, one thing before I go. 
[01:34:00]  Tell that outdated farm equipment Earl that the next time he goes to a place, he got bumper stickers.  Make sure he has extras left, though, when we get there.  Now, the sloth?  Where did you see the sloth giving out stickers?  That was last week.  My buddy was driving.  I don't know New York too well, but we were out in New York, and he had stopped at some place he was giving them out.  And he was just, like, tossing out, like, left and right.  And it's like, by the time we got through the crowd to get up there, it was all gone.  Yeah.  So, you know.  Well, something's going on with these wow stickers. 
[01:34:30]  They're holding them back.  Yeah, there's something stupid going on.  We have 170,000 wow stickers, and we're going through them really fast, and everyone's getting nervous.  So they're like, no, we've got to save them and make them last.  No, get them all out there.  We'll make more.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I understand guys taking, you know, a dozen or two for their buddies, and they're going to give them out.  I mean, heck, I take about a dozen myself and get my friends who can't make it out.  That's fine.  We don't care.  Just take 100 if you're going to use them.  We don't care.  Is he bringing a ton of them when he goes out, or is he going to get, like, a few hundred?  Check out this.  This is funny.  We're going to be at the Nassau Coliseum tonight. 
[01:35:00]  Uh-oh.  Someone's getting mad.  They're coming down with a whole box of stickers.  He's going to slam it right on the counter.  Oh, yeah?  Here he is.  Look.  Slam it on the counter.  Oh, wow.  That's great.  I knew that was coming.  Yeah, unfortunately, I'll get the doubles game tonight, so.  Matt's pissed at us.  Well, let me explain, though.  We're going to the Nassau Coliseum for Raw's War.  He just broke the counter.  I see.  Where are you guys going to be later this week?  Uh, we don't know.  Every day it's somewhere different, but tonight we're focusing on the Nassau Coliseum, Long  Island. 
[01:35:30]  Uh, huge fan base there.  You guys going to have to Central Jersey soon?  Uh, probably.  Psycho Mark and Spaz are going to be at Raw's War tonight, giving out the wow stickers.  Yeah.  Now, how many people go to Raw's War, Anthony, would you guess?  I don't know.  Maybe, uh, 20,000.  20,000.  Easily, I think.  There's how many people there?  I think you could fit 20,000 into the Coliseum.  Yeah.  Because you have all that rink, uh, space that they, you know, put chairs in and stuff.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, they gave us, like, I don't know, 2,500 stickers to give away tonight.  Yeah.  So we got mad and said, we need more stickers, and hence Matt throwing a whole box on the counter. 
[01:36:00]  If we need more, you just keep ordering them.  Yeah, we'll just keep, uh, making more.  Good deal.  All right, Alan.  All right, thanks a lot, guys.  Have a good day in, uh, syndication underground.  Yeah, it's happening.  Oh, it's happening.  Want to say hi to all the, all the people checking us out through the internet, uh, all over the country today.  Hello.  Thank you, Alan.  Take care.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Sean.  Sean, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, Sean.  Yeah, hey, how you doing?  Um, I just called to tell you guys, first of all, you guys are awesome.  I listen to you guys every day at work.  Thank you.  And, uh, I went on eBay on Friday to check out those wow stickers that that Jerkoff was trying to sell. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  I guess a bunch of people are selling the wow stickers on eBay, huh?  Yeah.  This one guy, Tommy Boy, he's selling three of them for, like, uh, he started at, like, three bucks, but the first set he was selling, uh, were up to, like, $15,000 when I got on there.  Yeah, like someone really is going to pay for that.  Well, the troops went out there, and obviously everybody's running it up for, uh, you know, just to mess with this guy.  But, uh, he put them up again, and I bid on them for, like, he had them for, like, $3.  I put my high bid at, like, $2,000, and I just got out there today for, like, $2,025. 
[01:37:00]  That's good.  So the guys are out there, so this Jerkoff, obviously, is not a fan, because a true fan wouldn't try and sell the stickers.  That's ridiculous.  You know, I couldn't get stickers yet, but I made my own.  Hey, you guys, you could really help us out.  But, um, you know, we don't mind if our material's all over the Internet and stuff, as long as it's free.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, except for, like, the Meta World.  We're trying to get some money out of that, whatever.  Yeah.  But besides that, we don't care what you guys send around the Internet for free.  But if you see people trying to sell, like, you know, T-shirts and WoW stickers and all that,  that's where the Army could really help us out and just jack up to the price of the stuff where, you know, they won't be able to sell it. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Well, definitely.  Like I said, the first one's up to, like, $15,000, so I figured that was done.  All right.  So, uh, what do I do, though, if, like, I have to, like, if I'm the last bidder, I just don't pay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  They can't force you to pay anything to you.  I guess so.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Look at the show on the ground.  All right.  Later.  Let's check in with Black Earl.  He's at WoW Central in the back office there with all the self-addressed stamped envelopes.  Earl, how are you doing today?  Fine.  Uh-oh.  All right.  What's wrong, Earl? 
[01:38:00]  Earl?  Yes.  How's the WoW sticker thing going today?  Fine.  How many did we get in today through the mail?  Another box full.  Are you mad at us?  I'm mad.  I'm just frustrated.  Why?  Because...  You don't like your new nickname?  Personally, honestly, no, I don't.  Why?  It's funny.  Yeah, funny for you, man.  That's funny.  Come on. 
[01:38:30]  But, I mean, we're getting them out as fast as we can.  We're just calling you the sloth.  Fine.  That's not racist or anything.  No.  It's the first non-racist nickname you got, I believe.  Earl.  Earl, how was your Saturday night shift?  Personally, honestly, terrified.  Yeah, Earl.  Terrified?  Terrified.  Earl had to do a show Saturday night.  It was the Earl show.  Well, it was terrifying in the respect that I didn't expect to do a shift. 
[01:39:00]  So they just threw you on the air?  I had no choice because we were supposed to run the Leica show.  And for whatever reason, it never showed up.  Now, this is funny because we have some audio of Earl's show.  Yeah.  Just listen to this.  This is Earl, I think, his first break.  Oh, oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  And then there were a few spots, and then they came back, and here is his second break. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying.  The funny part was, that's not far from the truth.  Earl, I believe I have some audio of you, too.  Oh.  Come on.  How about a good old nigger work song?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What?  Oh, what?  Earl loves that guy.  Don't you, Earl?  I love that movie. 
[01:40:00]  Topic of the show?  Buttons.  Buttons.  So, you don't want us to call you the sloth anymore?  I, I...  Earl, Earl is too good, though.  Let us call you the sloth for, like, a day.  Two days.  We'll drop it, we'll drop it Wednesday.  Like, today and tomorrow, because it's too much fun.  Fine.  I can hear you working, as you do this phone call with us today. 
[01:40:30]  Fine.  Steve checking in, the only thing terrifying was having to listen to it.  Hey, what did you do, Earl?  Just winged it.  Just played...  You were playing tunes, right?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  What'd you play?  What'd you play?  It's all over the place.  I played, like, I played Kits, Metallica.  Yeah.  Freebird?  No.  God, no.  No?  Oh, wow.  What, you got a little wrist game to play gimmick to your stuff?  No.  Like, people call me, like, we had a person calling for stairway, I'm like, hell no. 
[01:41:00]  The barber checking in from Jersey, tell that sloth to get back to work, I want my wow sticker.  People want their wow stickers, Earl.  Leave me alone, I'll get them out.  How many wow stickers have you put in envelopes since you came to work at 3 o'clock today?  Well, since I came in, probably a quarter of a mailbag.  So that'd be a couple hundred?  Yeah.  I hear some of Earl's breaks are up on Napster.  It's a different one.  It's Napster.  If you want to take a nap, you listen to it, and it puts you right out. 
[01:41:30]  It's like NyQuil.  All right, Earl.  Real funny, guys.  So, help me, help me, help me.  Somebody help me, help me, help me.  I can't get mad.  So, Earl, after you do the wow sticker thing today, what else does your job entail today?  I run Don and Mike tonight.  You're going to run a Don and Mike show.  Very good.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  The sloth, everyone.  Well, what...  You said we could call you the sloth until Wednesday. 
[01:42:00]  Well, you're going to do it anyway, so why fight it?  He learns.  There you go.  Okay.  Actually, one thing about the wow mailings...  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  People are asking for these stickers.  Like, they'll say, send me 10 wow stickers.  Send them.  Send them.  Send whatever you want.  No, and I have no problem doing that.  But they send us the smallest envelope.  Oh, my God, people.  You have to send an envelope of a proper size.  Yes.  Earl won't know what to do. 
[01:42:30]  No, man.  If you want...  No.  We will do...  We will send 10 easily.  Earl, what's harder?  Putting 10 bumper stickers in an envelope that doesn't quite fit 10, or putting a nail  in the wall to hang a picture.  What takes longer?  What?  What?  I'm going to make it fit?  It doesn't fit.  A sticker won't fit.  What?  Are you going to send 10 in one?  If it doesn't fit, Earl, you've got to kind of force it.  You know what I'm saying?  Mm-hmm.  Well, then we'll get the mail.  Yeah, he said they're all crumpily and stuff.  Hey, Earl, Steve wants to ask you about your Guns N' Roses seg from Saturday night. 
[01:43:00]  Was there a little problem?  My Guns N' Roses seg.  Yeah.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Did you have a little problem with a segway Saturday?  I had a problem with numerous segways.  I was a mess Saturday.  All right, Earl.  Get back to the self-addressed stamped envelopes.  Yeah.  Any other advice for the people sending the envelopes in?  Keep them coming.  Keep them coming.  Okay.  It's the sloth, everyone.  The sloth.  Earl. 
[01:43:30]  All right, Earl.  The Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying.  Butt sex.  Earl, would you like to have some butt sex?  Careful.  Oh, never mind.  Ouch.  Okay.  It depends who it's with.  If it's a guy, forget about it.  Okay.  Vinny, the racist wants to talk to you.  Vinny, what's going on?  How you doing, fellas? 
[01:44:00]  Good.  I just want to say, you know, I met Earl about two weeks ago.  I think it was on Anthony's birthday.  He was handing out the WOW stickers.  Yeah.  And, hey, he's a pretty classy guy.  He's a class act for a black guy.  I got a guy called it.  For a black guy.  Nice.  No, really.  I met him.  He's a really nice guy.  You know, took me by surprise.  But, you know, I got nothing there to say, and I think he's, you know, I know you guys  are a little rough on him, but, you know, he seems like a nice guy.  He's a great guy, just a little slow.  Vinny?  Yeah, well, you know.  Yo, Vinny. 
[01:44:30]  Most of his people are.  You know, being slow, Jesus.  Being slow is not bad.  As long as he's not out there killing these cabbies like most of the other blacks are doing.  And he's not, like, he's not Cuban, and he's not kidnapping kids from Cuba.  So, we got to give him credit.  Oh, gee.  Stank, I think.  All right.  He's a nice guy.  All right, Vinny.  All right, fellas.  Later.  Oh, my God.  Vinny, going for the Cardinals shot.  All right, Earl, did you air check, make a little recording there on Saturday's show? 
[01:45:00]  No, I didn't.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Why not?  Why not?  We'll find tape on it.  No, this is just, I'm pretty sure the tape exists.  I just, like I said, I just kind of fell together.  Earl, how much do you want to bet that we could probably get tape of you in the next ten minutes?  You can get tape in five minutes.  Let's get one break from Earl.  I would love to hear sort of what you're doing.  You will hear a drowning man on the air.  Who's got the tape?  Who has the tape?  Oh, help me. 
[01:45:30]  Earl, we're coming down to your little cubicle, and you're going to hand over your air check.  I didn't make an air check, though, but you can probably get off the skimmer.  Ben is saying you're lying.  Earl, aren't you trying to get into radio, like where you're on the air all the time?  Nope.  That isn't a goal of yours?  You weren't making tapes in the other studio for a long time trying to get on the air?  No.  You absolutely were.  You were making the air check tapes.  No, I was doing the public affairs tapes, but not the air.  I'm a mess on the air. 
[01:46:00]  There you are.  Earl, we need tape of you.  Yeah, I can produce tape.  Oh, I got a clip.  Let me know.  Let me know.  Come on.  Come on.  Give me some tape from Sam.  Come on, man.  It don't sound like crap, but I can get you tape of it.  I thought you said you didn't have it.  I said you could pull it off the skimmer.  All right.  We'll get some tape of you.  All right.  Skimmer.  Thank you, Earl.  Thank you.  Earl the Sloth, everyone.  They call it the skimmer.  You know what the skimmer does in a pool, don't you? 
[01:46:30]  Gets all the crap and scum and dead leaves off.  That's what the skimmer does on Earl's show, too.  All right.  All righty.  The Sloth, everyone.  Take care.  Okay.  All right.  Let's see if we can't get at least one break.  I'd love to hear what's going on in that.  He's got it.  Well, get it from him.  And we've got to take a break.  All righty.  Don't forget, if you're heading to the Coliseum for Raw's War tonight, we're going to be there 
[01:47:00]  with the WOW van.  Yeah.  Tons and tons of WOW stickers.  Mm-hmm.  Other stupid radio stations going there.  That's not cool.  That's our backyard.  Yeah.  It will be a problem.  Thank you.  We'll be back.  He and Anthony.  Stupid. </pre>
