<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with typical rambling, nonsensical banter before shifting to Anthony's furious complaint about a 4:40 AM phone call from Master Poe, the parking attendant, solely to inquire about Anthony's arrival time for restroom access.  This disrupts Anthony's meticulously planned sleep schedule, sparking a discussion about Master Poe's poor performance and Anthony's desperate need for uninterrupted sleep.  This frustration escalates when Anthony discovers he hasn't received his usual bagel because David, a staff member, is socializing in the studio.  This triggers a lengthy and vulgar rant against David, followed by an even more aggressive and foul-mouthed tirade aimed at a listener named Elmer from Iowa.

The show then delves into a discussion about the logistical problems plaguing their daily operations, covering staff responsibilities, workflow inefficiencies, and recent office space changes.  A listener calls in, relating to Anthony's need for undisturbed sleep.  Another caller, Steve the Trucker, offers the pragmatic solution of Anthony getting his own bagel.  Fontaine is noted as being present in the studio, making a comment about voting for Barack Obama because he's Black.  The segment concludes with Anthony previewing his anticipated strong reaction to Barack Obama's impending presidential election victory, promising a more in-depth discussion after a commercial break.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Grease is like the most amazing thing you could ever do.  I mean, Santorini is.  Speak Greek?  No, no.  A finger everyone's holding up.  Jimmy's impish.  I've been called imp other things.  As I sat there crying and a girlfriend lay on the bed going, it's okay.  You're impish.  I'm like, wrong words.  Close your eyes, you're right.  Okay, and go.  Oh, f***! 
[00:00:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Looks like someone's in a bad mood today.  Nah.  Looks like someone's in a bad mood today.  First of all.  It's just being Monday puts me in a mood.  Did you say Monday?  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  It's an imponderant mood day.  How are you today, Anthony?  Then I, uh...  Well, you know...  I've been trying anyway to see how this 5.30 thing works.  Yeah.  Getting in at 5.30 instead of 5 o'clock.  We have a very nice, for the most part, competent staff that, um... 
[00:01:30]  You know, it's not like when it was just me and Ope, had to come in and, you know, pause  through a lot of stuff.  They throw together a lot of good stuff.  I almost dropped the S-bomb right off the bat before the music even stops.  I almost dropped it.  And, um...  You know, I figured, uh, let me give you an extra half hour sleep is pretty good.  Especially on a moon day. 
[00:02:00]  Oh.  On a moon day.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the moon days.  Oh.  That's so stupid.  That's it.  So, I figure, uh, you know, we'll go for the 5.30 thing.  It's been working out pretty well.  Yeah.  I get in any time, you know, between 5.25 and 5.30, somewhere there, 5.35, whatever.  And this allows me to sleep a little longer.  Well, this morning, I get a phone call at, um, about 4.40 or so. 
[00:02:30]  Uh-huh.  See, there's still a 4 in front of the main number there of the clock.  4.  This is what I consider still last night.  It's, it's night time.  You get up around 5, I'm assuming?  Yep.  I get up around, uh, 5-ish. 
[00:03:00]  Actually, I'm out of the house at about, uh, 5.05, something like that.  And the people, I just want to add, the people that are listening to us now understand that  between 4.40 and 5, that 20 minutes, when you have to get up so god damn early, is really  important.  It's crucial.  That extra 20 minutes.  We got it.  Crucial.  Yeah.  I, um, yeah.  I, I, I get a call.  And, uh, you know, my, my, my phone, when it rings, uh, it rings, it's set to like that 
[00:03:30]  meh, meh, meh kind of alarm thing that happens during a nuclear meltdown.  Yeah.  Um, so it goes off, and, uh, I pick it up, and, and, and here's what I get.  Hello, Anthony.  It's Master Poe.  What time are you getting in?  What?  What time are you getting in this morning?  5.30. 
[00:04:00]  Why?  I have to go to the bathroom.  What?  Yeah.  What?  You what?  I have to go to the bathroom.  I just wanted to know what time you were coming in.  Uh, did I wake you?  Yeah, kinda.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[00:04:30]  I'll see you later.  Click.  He is as dumb as they come.  So, so now, he is a dummy.  That, that extra sleepy time that I so love, the extra sleepy time that, by the way, is  the reason that over at, uh, uh, XM, you don't see me fall asleep anymore.  And we appreciate that, Anthony.  I, you know something?  It's all I needed.  We appreciate that you're not falling asleep anymore. 
[00:05:00]  But that whole, that whole thing where it's, that, I found that that half hour is key.  Yeah, it really is.  To me not crashing out during the last part of the XM show.  Yeah.  And, uh, to get that call like that.  Cause I, I, the first of all, I look and it says blocked.  So, I have to answer it.  It could be, you know, someone's dead or a messed up post got a drop of deuce.  One or the other. 
[00:05:30]  I don't think you, you gotta explain it to the newbies out there.  Master Poe's whole, his whole job is to, you know, be outside this building in the morning.  Yeah.  To make it a little easier so you can run in.  And he, and he parks your car.  Yeah.  That's his, that's all he does.  Yeah.  He gets paid handsomely.  And honestly, that's all he does.  Right now, he's sitting somewhere for the next three hours doing God knows what.  Like, what does he do between now and the time we get over to XM? 
[00:06:00]  I don't know.  I, I don't know what he does.  I don't, it's not my business.  He could have the easiest job in America and he, and he messes that up.  It's not my business.  Yeah.  What my business is, is sleeping when I want to and getting in, uh, before the show starts  with enough, you know, prep time and, and, and not falling asleep.  Yeah.  That's pretty much all I got to do.  Yeah.  Um, I, uh, that didn't work out this morning and it kind of got me, uh, what they call cranky. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  You, whenever you're woken up like that, that with a first, when the first thing in the  morning from sleep to being annoyed happens, it, it lasts with me the whole day.  Everyone has their, their little pet peeves, the things that set them off, the things that  make them cranky for a while.  That's mine.  I've never been a jump out of bed guy.  I've, I've never been, I, I need to sleep and, and, you know, have my mornings go the 
[00:07:00]  way I need them to go.  If I hit a traffic jam on the expressway, that's another thing that'll get me going.  Sure.  But you know, early in the morning, that's a rarity.  Uh, any other little thing that could happen between me sleeping and me coming here.  Once I'm at work, I know I'm at work.  So whatever happens happens.  Uh, but those other times that are my times that they, that's where I lose my mind and  it affects me the whole God effing day. 
[00:07:30]  Nice.  So now I'm in a bad mood, which is good for the radio show.  Well, whatever it is, I am in it.  It's good for the radio show.  Not good for you personally.  And then, but can I jump in here and tell you something I've told you many times?  Jump.  You got to, you have to turn your phone off at night.  I can't.  No one does.  I do.  You're a weirdo for doing that.  I do.  You're the weird guy.  But I, you said you got to shut your phone off because you got to siphon all the gas  out of your tank before you put it in your garage. 
[00:08:00]  Like you're saying things that you do that you assume everyone does.  No one turns their phone off.  I'm not saying everyone should do this, but considering the hours you keep, you really  should maybe at least think about turning your phone off.  I need communication.  Why?  I need an open line.  Because if I get that call that, you know, there's a problem with somebody or someone's  gravely ill or, or that it is an important thing that I have to come in early for something.  I don't know what.  Anything but Poe making a duty. 
[00:08:30]  That's what the phone's on for.  Who thought I'd get a call saying I got to go caca?  Yeah, but even if you get that phone call, there's nothing you could do.  I, you know, I don't, I'm not going to bring everyone down.  I got that phone call and guess what?  In the end, there's nothing you could do.  So you might as well get a good night's sleep and deal with it in the morning.  You're blaming the victim here.  I understand.  You really are blaming the victim.  Thank you.  But thank you, Jimmy.  Why did you wear that skirt?  You should have known.  I'm not blaming Anthony because what I'm trying to do here is this. 
[00:09:00]  Poe is a dummy and he will do it again and again and again.  He's stupid.  This is what you should do is get, like, I have a, I have a phone number.  No one has.  Oh, is that the, uh, five, one, six?  No.  Oh, it's, it's the nine, one, seven, three.  No, I got another one.  You got a secret number.  I got a secret number. 
[00:09:30]  So if, I mean, if God forbid something awful is happening and they need me, what, why would  they need me?  I don't have any skills to save somebody.  Yeah, but I just have to be, I have to just go to the hospital and be depressed for three  days.  That's my job in, in these situations.  So in the end, there's nothing you could do if God forbid you get that phone call.  So you might as well get a good night's sleep.  I wouldn't even turn on the phone call until you had a cup of coffee in the morning and  a nice warm breakfast.  No, because you're going to need, you're going to need all the rest of you, you can. 
[00:10:00]  Cause if you do get that phone call, it's going to be three to four days of no sleep in  my head.  No, no.  And that walking like a zombie.  So you should be prepared for it with a, no, that's not how I roll.  I need my phone to be there right next to my bed, right next to the 45 gun and phone.  What if you answer the 45?  Cause you're a little woozy, right?  I can't answer the 40.  Hello.  I don't want to answer that.  I'm going to get you a, uh, a phone, uh, in the shape of a gun this Christmas, just  cause I think it'd be cute. 
[00:10:30]  Now that will confuse me.  And then, uh, I, I, I come in.  Don't even do part two.  No, no.  I'm just doing this.  This one.  Here's, here's my, uh, well, this is part three.  That's my bagel.  Because for some effing reason, you can still eat it, by the way.  I am, uh, no, it's in the garbage now.  I'm not going into the puke pail, uh, for that.  I banked it off the glass.  Nice shot.  It was a good shot.  It actually went into the garbage. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, it was very impressive.  Uh, uh, I, I, so now I don't eat, uh, until later because, uh, I don't know.  I guess I don't rate enough to, uh, get what I need, uh, in here to eat.  Call me whiny.  I don't even care at this point.  Yes, I am whining, but I don't get what I'm going to eat because, uh, I guess because  David was in the bathroom.  No, David.  What's with everyone taking a dump?  David was socializing.  Oh, Jimmy.  Well, he was socializing. 
[00:11:30]  He was socializing?  He was socializing because I walked in here to go to the bathroom and he's just holding  court in the, in, in the studio.  He thinks he's a star now.  Was he conveying his post story that we'll hear about later?  He thinks he's a star.  I heard him talking to Kenny and just kind of socializing.  David.  David.  Could you grab the microphone, please?  Good morning, David.  Yes, I could grab the microphone.  Hi, David.  Do you, do you know I'm, I'm here every day, every weekday?  Why are you waiting?  Answer his question. 
[00:12:00]  Yes, I know you're here.  I know that, yes.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  You know, I'm here every day.  Of course, it's your show.  Of course I know it.  Yes.  Every, every morning.  What do I, what do I get?  Every morning.  Every morning?  Yeah.  Every morning you get a, you get a toasted plain bagel with light cream cheese on the  side.  Right.  Like, that's all I asked for.  And, and why, why wasn't it, like, brought, I, now I can't eat.  Why didn't you get it, David? 
[00:12:30]  What happened?  What were you, what were you doing?  Because he thinks he's a star.  What were you doing that was a little more important?  Oh.  Were you going, were you going boom, boom?  Did you have to make a boom, boom, too?  No, I did not.  Like, Mr. Pooh?  No, I did not.  But I was busy, I was busy getting, I was busy getting the, on the coffees that I usually  get.  I was doing that.  I always get the coffee, so that's what I was doing.  The coffees for who?  For Jimmy and for Steve.  At what time was this?  This was at, like, uh, uh, 5.35. 
[00:13:00]  All right.  What time did you get in?  What time did I get into the studio?  I got to the studio at 5.  So, you know, it could be there on my desk when I get in.  Get his bagel.  Before you leave.  It takes long.  Like, these guys can bring coffee into the studio with them and drink it as they're doing  the show.  I can't friggin' eat during the show!  Only the part we phone in, the XM part. 
[00:13:30]  Then I can eat.  But now, now, now, now.  No.  And Elmer from Iowa, plunk this son of a C down.  Hey, crap for brains.  Listen to me, Elmer.  Nice name, Jackoff.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  I sound like a prima donna.  There are certain ways this job works.  Ass.  Certain ways this job works.  I need my crap in the morning or else I don't.  Everything's timed out. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  There you go, crybaby.  Are you the type of guy that gets pulled over by the cops over here in Iowa and says,  do you know who I am?  And then when we're beating you down, we say, nope.  Why?  Are you a cop in Iowa?  Are you a cop in Iowa, Elmer?  Well, I'm a farmer in Iowa and I'm also a deputy.  A farmer in Iowa and a deputy.  Shut up.  Grab a corncob and shove it.  You farmer. 
[00:14:30]  All right, farmer, Elmer.  Farmer, Elmer.  Go to your fat wife and have sex with her, farmer, Elmer.  What's that like?  Does she cook you up some breakfast in the morning?  You slob.  Shut up, you fat Iowan slob, Elmer.  You frigging farmer.  You're a farmer.  You're a farmer.  I'm sorry I don't have a pig wife to make me breakfast.  Shut up.  Go slob your wife.  Slob your wife. 
[00:15:00]  Suey.  Suey.  Suey.  That means Elmer and his wife want to have some sex.  Shut up, you and your pig farmer wife.  I hate your filthy family.  Your whole filth family.  I hope your daughter has sex with a presidential candidate.  Shut it.  There goes Elmer.  Elmer stinks on ice.  Him and his fat pig farmer wife.  Go farm. 
[00:15:30]  I hope your frigging kid gets caught in a combine.  That's Elmer's wife.  What are you saying, honey?  Oh, you want me to tag that fat ass?  That's Elmer's wife, his fat pig wife, and his stupid, retarded, cross-eyed, inbred children.  Die, Elmer.  Die on your tractor.  Oh, it's going to be...  Just die.  Fall off your tractor and die.  It's going to be a great four years of radio, because I know what this is really about. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, it's about the front page of the newspaper.  I know it is.  We'll get into that in a second.  But first, Cody in Indiana.  David, why are you still sitting here?  Go get his effing bagel.  Hey, guys.  Anthony's hungry.  No, I don't want a bagel.  I can't eat it.  Then what do you want, David, to get you?  Is this a bad thing?  Get a crucifix and wear it.  Tired of you.  If I may say so.  Didn't Ron get the bagel finally?  Didn't he go and get it finally?  Yeah, but that was your job. 
[00:16:30]  It's this.  You know when it came in?  Enough of this palaver.  That's when I got my bagel.  Enough of this palaver.  I can't sit here with a mouthful of bagel and eat.  We can only do that on the other show.  Yes.  I think Anthony wants to know that you are here.  So if you got the call, he's at 535.  Why not get his bagel and make sure it's here for you?  That's their job, Elmer.  Just like your pig wife's job is to have sex with you and peel the corn. 
[00:17:00]  Farmer.  A farmer from Iowa is telling me crap.  Go blow.  Do you know who I am?  And then they go, nope, because we don't.  No.  Elmer's wife's name?  Iowa.  And I would never be in Iowa.  Elmer's wife's name?  Anyone?  What?  Gus.  Come on.  Gus and Elmer.  Exactly.  Hip-hop, what happened to the bagel?  You had to do David's job, right?  Yeah, well, usually I apologize for not getting your breakfast earlier.  Usually Kenny tells David to get that like 505.  So now you're blaming Kenny.  No, no, no. 
[00:17:30]  That's what's been happening for the past couple of weeks.  So I just assumed there's...  Kenny, comment.  Are you to blame?  I don't know.  Because you didn't instruct him to do what he's asked to do every goddamn day?  Yes, I am to blame.  I am sorry.  Sometimes, hopefully I can make it up to you and I will take blame for this misfortune.  No.  I'm not letting Kenny take the blame.  No, I insist.  The interns should know what their job is on a daily basis.  And that's the whole key to this thing. 
[00:18:00]  It's not me being a prima donna Elmer and your fat wife.  It's just things are...  There's a certain system here.  Yeah.  The way things work.  And when the machine breaks down, we break down.  We can blame CBS then.  Why?  Well, because the interns used to be in a different office and they could see Anthony passing the doorway when he came in the morning.  Do they have a clock?  Wait, they took that office away from us now?  Yeah, so now they have to sit in here where they can't see Anthony come in. 
[00:18:30]  Why do they take that office away from us?  Hook up mirrors so they can all look in the mirrors.  What office?  Wait, why the F do they take that office away from us?  Now, I'm with you, Anthony.  What is that office now?  That's their production office.  Production!  They had dirt jukebox!  What the hell do they have to produce?  There's like a news person that, I guess, looks up the news and weather and...  Dude, we have ten people in one room.  Yes.  We used to have two other rooms. 
[00:19:00]  We had a green room and another room where the interns and the help would hang out in.  And now they took that room away from us as well because the green room they made into the studio for this dumb station that just plays tunes.  Right.  What's going on, stunt brain?  That room's been gone for about three months.  Oh, wow.  They turned that into a news studio for them when they moved over here.  What news are they doing?  They played doo-wop records.  The one they talk about is dead.  Holy crap. 
[00:19:30]  Why do we always get crapped on?  Why?  Constantly.  Why do we always get crapped on?  You know when we have guests now, they have to be on the other side of the building?  There's some weird green room on the other side of the floor.  Really?  Why didn't they put the studio down over there?  Then we wouldn't bother those hacks.  What's this?  What's that?  It's their lovely empty newsroom that we used to have.  Empty?  Yeah.  Great.  Oh, it's empty all the time.  I'm going to have a little surprise for their newsroom later on this week.  You're going to pull a Poe in there? 
[00:20:00]  Yes, I am.  I'm going to hide it, too.  I'm going to hide it.  Cody in Indiana, what's up?  Hey, guys.  First of all, order Jim Norton's book, I Hate Your Guts, on Amazon.com.  Thank you, sir.  Tomorrow's the day.  Go ahead, Cody.  Okay.  Secondly, it goes profession to profession if you need to shut your phone off or not.  Like, I drive for a living.  I shut my phone off.  I need my sleep.  If someone's dead, they're going to be dead when I wake up.  So, that's how it goes.  I Hate Your Guts tomorrow. 
[00:20:30]  Love you guys.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  That's my logic.  You know, Brian from Bayonne brings up a good point.  Brian?  Brian, yes, sir?  You know why he called you at 540?  He called you at 440?  He forgot to set his clock back.  You know something?  I bet that happened.  Wow.  I bet he didn't set the clock back.  His clock said 540.  And he's wondering, like, hey, you know, Jesus Christ, it's 20 minutes to the show and you're  not in yet. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  And I got to go to the bathroom.  He has to make do-doos.  These people don't understand how this show works.  Steve the Trucker.  Steve, go ahead.  First off, I want to say, Jimmy, I got your first book and I've already ordered your second  one.  You're great, man.  Thanks, buddy.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Why can't you just leave your house 10 minutes early and get your own bagel?  It's no big deal.  Hey, Steve, the ass.  Have you listened to what I've been saying?  10 minutes is crucial with our schedule. 
[00:21:30]  I can't stop in 10 minutes.  I run on fumes sometimes because I can't stop and pump gas into my car at that hour.  Everything is timed out for me to get the most sleep I can because with these hours, I cannot  sleep as long as I want to.  And a lot of times, none of these places are open until about 530 or so.  10 minutes is crucial.  I can't stop at a hooker stop, grab some sex, and then go to sleep in my cab.  Steve the Trucker. 
[00:22:00]  What are you hauling today?  Boredom?  Bye, boy.  And Anthony.  I hope there's an abutment with your name on it.  You should not be made to do menial tasks in your life.  Look, Kenny, don't play into these idiots.  That's not what it's about.  It's not a menial task.  I'll get my own bagel.  If I could start the show 10 minutes later.  No.  You will not get your own bagel.  I will serve you hand and foot.  Keep the feet out of it. 
[00:22:30]  Disgusting big cop flat foot things you got.  I was walking the beat.  Fontaine is on the O.P.  Anthony show.  Fontaine.  Hey, that's Club Soda Kenny.  He's the number two funny man on the show.  Yes, that's right.  According to Stupid David.  Go ahead, Fontaine.  And I am voting for Obama because he's black.  That's phase two of my anger.  Strap in, boys.  Come on, Anthony.  God.  All right.  Well, you know, just whatever. 
[00:23:00]  I'm sure Fontaine's waiting for all his free stuff that comes when they win the contest.  Well, this is what.  When black people win the big contest coming up on Tuesday for free stuff.  This is what it's really about.  The realization has hit, Anthony, that we're going to have a black president and he's out  of his effing mind.  It has nothing to do with Polk calling you or your bagel being a little late today.  It's really about.  Just the black president.  It's really about Obama.  It's everything that goes along with it.  I understand.  Everything I'm reading.  Everything I'm seeing on videos.  Everything I'm watching.  Dude, it's insane. 
[00:23:30]  People are losing their minds with expectations all on whitey's, poor whitey's back.  And I told you, they're going to be very disappointed, those people.  Are they?  Yes.  They think there's going to be a.  Well, let's get into it after the break.  After the break.  Because we're going to need some time for this.  All right.  It's the greatest thing to happen to our radio show, though.  Is it?  Yes, it is.  It really is.  McCain would have been boring for this radio show.  A black president is the best thing to happen to us. 
[00:24:00]  It's kind of like when Limbaugh had Clinton to kick around for a while.  For eight years.  We'll see.  They don't talk about Limbaugh as much, right?  We'll see.  All right.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Phase two of Anthony's anger.  Yes.  In just a bit.  I have a message for the black people.  You do?  Yes.  Nice. </pre>
