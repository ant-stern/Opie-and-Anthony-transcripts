<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' characteristic rambling and nonsensical banter, quickly shifting to a discussion of disturbing internet content, including autopsy videos and Vince Neil's botched plastic surgery.  They then transitioned to celebrity-spotting websites like Gawker Stalker and shared anecdotes about celebrity sightings in Manhattan.  Listeners called in, with Rob detailing a TLC special about patients regaining consciousness during surgery due to anesthesia errors, prompting a discussion with an anesthesiologist caller who explained the phenomenon of surgical recall.  The conversation veered to fitness, contrasting the hosts' gym experiences with the physique of "Club Soda Kenny," further fueled by caller anecdotes, including one about a possible break-in and another describing their father's awareness during a leg amputation. A substantial portion of the show tackled the issue of undocumented workers, with callers from various industries (construction, landscaping) detailing the reliance on this workforce and the difficulties in finding Americans willing to do the same jobs at comparable wages. The hosts and callers debated the economic realities, cultural differences, and the perceived lack of assimilation, acknowledging the tacit agreement surrounding the illegality of the situation.  The segment concluded with more calls on diverse topics, including travel and medical procedures.

The next segment heavily featured alternative comedians, particularly focusing on the perceived hypocrisy of comedians like David Cross criticizing Larry the Cable Guy for alleged homophobia and racism while seemingly overlooking similar behavior in other comedians, especially those of different ethnicities.  Carlos Mencia and Dave Chappelle were also mentioned. A caller challenged the hosts for their past failure to call out Aries Spears for using racial arguments in a previous segment.  The show then played audio clips from Rosie O’Donnell's "gay family cruise," featuring songs, announcements, and interviews with passengers highlighting the diverse range of families and their experiences with adoption, artificial insemination, and family dynamics.  The hosts' commentary ranged from humorous to cynical.  The upcoming arrival of guest Simon Rex was anticipated, with speculation about his sexuality and past career in adult films. Aaron Sheik, a World Wrestling Federation champion, was also a guest during this segment.

The show then began with a crude, comedic bit about conception, followed by a call from Paul from Tennessee, an adoptee expressing negative views towards gay adoption.  This sparked a discussion about the challenges and costs of adoption, specifically focusing on the disproportionate availability of African-American children and children from families with drug histories.  Audio clips from a cruise ship adoption seminar highlighted the difficulties faced by same-sex couples seeking adoption. A gay comedian who performed on the cruise was mentioned, with a clip of his act discussing his coming out and becoming a donor dad for a lesbian couple.  Whispered conversations between the hosts preceded the arrival of Simon Rex, who was immediately confronted with a Page Six article alleging he was found with his pants down in a nightclub bathroom. Rex denied the specific details but admitted to intoxication. The interview focused on the article, his past career, his association with Paris Hilton, and a solo masturbation video he admitted to making for financial reasons.  The conversation included extensive sexually explicit and vulgar language.  The discussion continued with further details of Rex's career and experiences in Hollywood, including his affinity for Wolfmother.  Additional banter followed, including comparisons of women in Los Angeles versus New York, stand-up comedy challenges, and personal anecdotes from the hosts and Ben.

The final segment started with discussions of unique apartment features, followed by a listener's photoshopped image depicting a swastika made of tiles.  The conversation shifted to hoarding, sparked by a listener's story about two brothers, one blind and crippled, who died under a pile of newspapers. Numerous callers shared experiences with hoarders, including a paramedic describing a horrific scene of a deceased woman surrounded by garbage and animals, and another caller finding $10,000 and a valuable stamp collection in a hoarder's home.  Callers described compulsive saving habits, including one saving every Post-it note, and another whose mother kept her dead cats in the freezer.  The hosts discussed the various aspects of hoarding and the challenges faced by families.  The segment concluded with a discussion of guest Twitchels, a comedian with Tourette Syndrome, his experiences at a Tourette Syndrome conference, and his Tourette’s tics, particularly his face-slapping, with Opie and Anthony attempting to help manage the tic using icy hot.  The segment ended with promotion of Twitchels' upcoming stand-up show.

[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I hate this place. 
[00:05:00]  Nothing works here.  The medication's on water.  I've been here for seven years.  I've been here for seven years.  Beyond FM is XM satellite radio.  ONA party rock!  Oh, no, no, really.  Oh, ow.  And the wood, but, uh, you know. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, no, no, really.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I love that one.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Oh.  Isn't that a great new addition?  The cops being tasered.  You know how they, you know, test each other out with the taser? 
[00:06:00]  This is them being tasered.  And just screaming like a bitch.  That's pretty much it.  They gave him a good shot.  Where's that audio from?  Online.  You know, one of the guys found it.  You know, the internet.  Yeah, that internet.  The good old internet.  I found myself yesterday on that internet. 
[00:06:30]  And I don't know how I got there, but I got on, you know, wacky video clips and stuff.  What's your just troll around?  What's your favorite website these days?  I don't really have one, but it's just I end up places that are pretty cool.  And this is all just videos.  You know those sites that are compilations of a bunch of wild videos.  And then I hit a couple that I'm like, oh, why did I hit that?  Like one is just this autopsy going down on some woman.  Seen this one yet?  Oh, that's pretty cool.  Oh, it's not.  Why? 
[00:07:00]  Some woman laid out, covered up her, you know, naughty bits and her face you can't see.  But the autopsy guy, the coroner, is just going, well, the first one is your typical Y incisions that we make from the shoulder down to the sternum.  Just cuts her twice like that.  And then from there down to the pubic bone.  And then we, and I was like, boink, off.  Can't take it.  Don't like that stuff.  She was alive and being fucked on the table.  I'd watch. 
[00:07:30]  But I don't like that stuff.  Give me the heebie-jeebies.  Have you seen the Vince Neil plastic surgery clips?  No.  Oh, man.  Good ones?  And they show that right on TV.  On one of those clip shows.  Have not seen that one.  The shit they did to that guy's face.  Do they show it actually happening?  Or before and after?  They show enough on VH1 where you're grossed out like, oh my, oh my God.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Do you have his eyes done? 
[00:08:00]  He had pretty much everything done.  A facelift?  They show like his, pretty much them taking his nose off or pulling it to the side and  then scraping some shit out and putting it back and then something with a scalp and just  like, oh my, how do you, and you're breathing and dreaming in there somewhere because they're  fucking around with your face like that?  You hope, you hope you're not just like feeling everything and unable to move.  Oh, yes.  I'd love to scream now.  This really hurts.  What a nightmare.  That's got to be like a fear.  Yeah.  Like a Twilight Zone episode.  Like, oh my God.  Where that guy is alive and everyone thinks he's dead and he's just laying in the road 
[00:08:30]  and then all they see is a little tear come out of the corner of his eye at the end of  the episode.  He's like, oh my God, he's alive.  Yeah.  They don't make shit like they used to.  No.  Twilight Zone stuff was so scary.  Good creepy stuff.  How about the guy that hired someone to like, he was going to get in a coffin or something  and like, they were going to, it was a scam for some reason, but the guy was going  to get him out of the coffin.  He was going to hide under a body in the coffin.  And so when they put him under the body, they go up to the body above him and it was the 
[00:09:00]  guy that was supposed to get him out.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  I remember that one.  That was a good one.  By the way, my favorite website these days.  Yeah.  Gawker Stalker.  Gawker Stalker.  I don't think it's gawkerstalker.com.  Go to gawker.com.  G-A-W-K-E-R.com.  Slash Stalker.  And then slash stalker.  Right.  This is the website that George Clooney is trying to get shut down by trying to get  all his peeps. 
[00:09:30]  And George Clooney is always very active.  And all the publicists out there to, you know, just flood this site with fake sightings.  But basically it keeps track of celebrities all over Manhattan.  Wow.  Oh, it's great.  Henry Kissinger.  I can't get enough of this.  What is it like keep track of their address or something?  No, like spottings.  Oh, Sunday.  Also like here, Kevin Bacon, Broadway at West 66th Street.  Actually, a movie theater I go to all the time. 
[00:10:00]  I just saw Kevin Bacon waiting in the lobby of the Lincoln Square Movies at 66th and Broadway.  He was quietly standing there looking scary skinny.  No one paid any attention to him.  That sighting was yesterday at 3 p.m.  Yes, yesterday at 11 a.m.  Or no, a couple days ago actually at this point.  Yesterday at 11 a.m.  Apparently Quentin Tarantino was walking through Washington Square Park drinking Starbucks.  Yeah.  Tried to follow to see what they were talking about.  Jeez, that is creepy. 
[00:10:30]  Little nosy buddies.  I love it.  And Clooney hates this sight that, you know, like I said, he's trying to get all these publicists  and his friends to just flood the damn thing with fake sightings.  So, I'm trying to think if there's any other really good ones.  Let's see.  Yeah, like Henry Kissinger was spotted on April 10th at 3 p.m.  Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Jennifer Jason Leigh.  She was at the pool house with Damone. 
[00:11:00]  Briefly.  And then they show you a little map of Manhattan and they just, you know, have little pinpoints  where all these celebrities were.  Ashton Kutcher, East 14th Street and 3rd Avenue, April 9th, 2006 at 6 p.m.  Ashton Kutcher in the front passenger seat of a black SUV, bearded and wearing big sunglasses  and very cute.  Ooh.  He had the window rolled down and was gawking at the Traders' Joe line, which is still very  long on a late Sunday afternoon. 
[00:11:30]  It's all Manhattan?  Yeah, for the most part.  For the most part.  I'm sure this site will expand to other cities eventually, maybe L.A. and stuff.  L.A.  But this is the website that Clooney just absolutely wants shut down.  So then this dopey website, they're like, hey, if you spot George Clooney and you get a  picture of him in Manhattan, we'll give you like two DVDs of Ocean's Eleven and Ocean's  Twelve.  Oh, great.  Wonderful.  That's my latest website that I'm enjoying. 
[00:12:00]  That's pretty cool.  Cockerstalker.com.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's going on today?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Yeah, going back to that whole being aware during surgery thing, I watched this special  on TLC about people who were actually like aware of what was going on.  For some reason, if you don't make the mix, like if the anesthesiologist doesn't mix whatever  he's doing right, you got to be, they have to sedate you and keep you unconscious, but  a lot of times they put you unconscious, but they don't sedate you. 
[00:12:30]  So you're still feeling everything that's going on.  They were talking to this woman once who said like they were operating on her face.  She actually like felt her bone burning when they were like sawing into her face.  She actually like smelt it.  And the only reason they realized that the whole anesthesia went wrong was they followed  her heart monitor and her like EKG or whatever was going through the roof.  And it's a very scary thing, you know, if they don't do it right because you can feel 
[00:13:00]  everything.  Yeah.  Has anyone else out there taken a peek at TLC lately?  That channel has become the freak channel.  It's like the surgery channel.  It's the surgery channel.  It's the, it's the sideshow stuff.  It's a, it's that new reality show, you know, little people, big world with the midget  family with three kids that are normal size and one, one, one midget kid.  Yeah.  Weren't they like house construction or something at one point?  And then another one, they were kind of turned into trying to be discovery. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  They were trying to find their identity.  Now they, they've found it.  Oh, it's all about, uh, freak shows now.  Hey, why is it so cold in here?  Yeah.  Freezing.  Over the weekend, they removed, uh, I watched a special, they removed a tumor off of this  woman that was 200 pounds.  Yeah.  200 pound tumor.  They showed the fat people that, uh, are living in their beds.  Hey, the second thing I saw, and I talked about it when Twitchells was here, was that  Tourette's girl who got this electronic implant in her brain, uh, to stop her Tourette's. 
[00:14:00]  And they put these two electrodes, drilled a hole in her head, shoved these electrodes down  into her, the middle of her brain, and then ran wires down her back where a little computer  pack, two computer packs were by the back of her hips underneath her, you know, skin  inside of her.  And while they were putting the probes in, they had to test it with this electric signal,  and she had to be awake during the whole thing.  So she's sitting in a chair, strapped in, her head is like battened down, and completely 
[00:14:30]  conscious, just under local anesthesia on her scalp, while they drilled a hole in her  head, and shoved electrodes in her brain, and started, started them up.  And you see her arms start going, she goes, oh, I'm feeling that, I'm a, I don't like this.  Oh my god, the electrodes in the center of your brain.  It's just easier to have somebody walk around with you, and every time you start to go,  they just go, shut up.  Stop it.  Touch your mouth.  Enough.  Embarrassing yourself.  Uh, let's go to Sandman in the Midwest. 
[00:15:00]  Sandman.  Hey, this is Sandman.  I heard you guys talking about, uh, being awake during, uh, surgery or anesthesia.  Yeah.  I'm an anesthesiologist.  Uh, actually, that's called recall.  Uh, and, uh, it's when you have to paralyze somebody, you give them a muscle relaxant and  paralyze them, and then you also give, you know, different medications, narcotics and  sedation to, you know, provide anesthesia.  But, uh, if you just paralyze somebody and don't give them enough sedation or anesthesia. 
[00:15:30]  You're, you're why?  Sure.  Uh, I was interested in this.  You're what?  Where'd the man go, Opie?  Douglas Quaid.  Hi, I'm Hauser.  Recall, my anesthesia doesn't work.  This show is so fucking weird, man.  Did we even think we were going to talk about this?  No.  At the start of the program?  Well, I'm scared.  I want to get surgery, and I'm, like, hesitant because of that. 
[00:16:00]  I'm going to worry about it.  What, your, uh, sinus?  No, no, I want to get pectorals put in.  I want big pecs.  Big pecs?  I want to get some, like, saline pecs.  I want chest implants.  Big pints.  Ugh.  Big muscular chest implants.  Big pints.  Why'd you start with a push-up?  I do a lot of push-ups.  At least see what, uh, that'll do.  I do the girl kinds on my knees.  I just kind of, you know.  You do not.  Remember that?  That does nothing.  No?  No.  That's, that's, that's, that's there, so the girls look like they're doing something.  During the presidential physical fitness test that you had to take in school, and you'd 
[00:16:30]  look over at the girls, and they're doing all the same things, but different.  But different.  They're doing the same exercises, only completely different.  Right.  I use the big ball in the gym now to do my crunches.  Yeah.  Because I like it.  And what a faggot I felt like when Club Soda Kenny walked around the corner, we were in  the gym, and he's just such a savage in the gym.  Giant.  Big face.  Pick up the ball, Jimmy.  No, it's really, because we were looking for it, and there's like all these big men in  the gym, and he was in Poughkeepsie, and he walks over, and he goes, I found a ball.  I'm like, ugh.  Jesus, do you have to make me feel like a soccer mom? 
[00:17:00]  So I go back there, and I'm doing it myself, and Kenny walks in.  I'm like, man, these things really hurt.  Like, what a faggot I felt like.  Bop.  Getting caught on the ball.  I've worked out with Club Soda Kenny many times.  Embarrassing.  And I do all right in the gym.  And then he just makes me look ridiculous.  I'll do like, you know.  It's an animal.  I'll do bench press, and I do okay for my size.  And then it's like, okay, my turn.  And then he empties out the entire rack of 45.  Asks you to stand on it.  It's a light day for me.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  And so he's like, you know, bench pressing like 300, like it's nothing, or whatever it  is.  He's a beast.  I'm like, oh my God.  And then it's my turn, and he has to take off all the 45.  Not all of them, but.  Let me take a couple off for you.  Right.  I don't want you to hurt yourself.  It's like, ah.  And then I get him back.  It's like, all right, it's time to do some ab work and some crunches.  You ready?  Nothing's worse than starting out at the gym after you haven't been there a while.  Starting out.  Because, you know, you can't hurt yourself. 
[00:18:00]  So you have the biggest pussy with the littlest weights, the shortest amount of reps.  I like doing light weights, though, with a lot of reps.  I find that helpful.  Yeah.  I don't want to get big involved.  You want a tone, right?  Pussy.  No, no.  I want to Bruce Lee kind of put on a tone.  I want to be like Bruce Lee.  Hey, this guy, Mike's been waiting for like 20 minutes to talk to us.  Hi, Mike.  Mike, you think you caught someone breaking into your house?  Hey, I need your opinion.  I'm sitting in my apartment the other night. 
[00:18:30]  Uh-huh.  And it's like 7.30 at night.  You sound like Eric, sir.  What's that?  You sound like Eric.  Yeah, I love that.  Oh, appreciate it.  Go ahead.  Hey, so I'm sitting there and I lock the doors when I'm in my apartment.  And it's like 7.30 at night.  And I hear the front door unlocking.  So I run over and I open it up and I'm like, who the fuck are you?  And some dude's standing there.  And he's like, is something broken inside your apartment?  And I was like, no. 
[00:19:00]  And he was like, oh, this is the wrong one.  And they left.  What time was this?  It was like 7.30 at night.  No one comes over at 7.30 at night to fix broken things.  And they don't just say it's something broken.  They're not using that vague.  Hi, I'm the guy to fix that thing.  I got a question.  Was he black?  No.  Then you weren't being broken.  Why did you throw out that odd gentleman?  I'm in upstate New York.  There are no black people here.  No, there's plenty of white trash thieves.  Did he have a mullet? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  I mean, he looked like a mullet thief.  Yeah.  What town?  What's that?  What town?  Clint Falls.  Where?  Clint Falls, New York.  Up near Lake George.  No, that guy was just stupid.  He might have been drunk.  I don't know.  Was he wearing a wife beater?  What's that?  Was he wearing a wife beater?  No, flannel shirt.  But he just walked into your apartment?  Yeah.  I mean, he didn't even knock or anything.  Oh, yeah.  He was checking for unlocked doors, sir.  Yeah.  He scared the shit out of me. 
[00:20:00]  And then if it was maybe he was a rapist, and if you were abroad, you'd have been banged.  Yeah.  All right, boys.  All right.  Thank you.  Have a good morning.  Let's get back to this anesthesia thing.  Kyle in O-Town.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Thank you.  Bring it on, brother.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi.  Thanks, fella.  That gig's over.  It's not my birthday.  My birthday's in July.  Whatever.  You guys were talking about horror stories about surgeries, and when I was younger, my  dad was telling me he's an amputee, that when they were having his leg amputated 
[00:20:30]  to load the knee, he woke up and heard the saw.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  And I actually felt blood and stuff.  So he had night terrors, actually, for about three years after that.  That'll do it.  Yeah.  Not to freak out anymore there, Jimmy, but it does happen.  There you go.  All right.  Let's go to Maryland and say hi to Tom.  Tom, what's up?  Yeah.  I had facial laser surgery.  I went through a call window when I was younger, delivering that Long Island Newsday paper. 
[00:21:00]  Dude, dude, dude, dude, did they put you in the paper?  No, no, no.  I was delivering the paper.  I got in a bad car accident.  Yeah, but usually if somebody does any kind of work for a newspaper, even delivering, if  something happens, they put a little blurb in there about the guy.  No, I did not make the paper.  Oh, best.  You didn't make the paper as you were delivering the paper.  Yeah.  And flew through the windshield.  So anyway, I have to...  What did you hit?  Parked car?  No.  My brother had his license for a week. 
[00:21:30]  We hit a telephone pole.  And all the papers, right around Thanksgiving time, as they get nice and thick, were behind  me and pushed me through the window.  Oh.  So you had a pile of newspapers come flying up, hit you in the head, and pushed you through  the window.  Right.  How badly injured were you, sir?  Very.  I had over 500 stitches in my face down at that Huntington Hospital there.  Wow.  Good old Huntington Hospital.  So anyway, I had several surgeries after to reconstruct my face. 
[00:22:00]  Oh.  And get to one of the final surgeries.  It's a laser surgery.  And I go to the doctor's office, as they do everything in offices now.  And he tells me the anesthesiologist got stuck in a case, but that the procedure is only about  15 minutes, and we can do it without any anesthesia.  Oh, that's great.  We're going to use this archaic method.  Could you bite this leather strap?  Yeah.  Here's a shot of whiskey.  Yeah.  Some whiskey. 
[00:22:30]  Here we go.  Maybe just punch you in the face real hard.  Hey, look over there.  Boom.  You punch him and knock him out.  So here I am fully awake for the surgery.  They didn't tell me that laser surgery is essentially the burning of your skin.  And so you got this lovely odor as the doctor is zapping you.  The only way I could describe the zapping feeling is having a staple gun put to your  face over and over again.  It's our next promotion.  And the burning sensation.  So it was lovely. 
[00:23:00]  And you were awake for the whole thing.  Awake for the whole thing.  Smelling your own skin burning.  Yeah.  So that's one thing I'll never forget.  Yeah.  That's pretty horrible.  Thank you.  Love the show.  All right.  I appreciate that.  Well, do you look better?  No.  No, of course he doesn't.  We don't.  Scott and Belmore, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  We don't need an ending.  Yeah, I'm an amputee.  I lost my leg and all that shit.  But yesterday at the Day Labor's Lally, I saw a celebrity and I wanted to get that sight.  Okay. 
[00:23:30]  I saw Juan Valdez and he sucked my neck for five bucks.  Juan?  What?  Juan Valdez?  I don't really get it.  The coffee guy?  Do you get it?  What?  Something Valdez and he talked, but he talked like this.  It sounded like John Valdez, but...  Sounds like it's some kind of bit he was doing.  I don't know.  At the labor, you know, the immigrant thing that they did yesterday.  Oh, with a friend of his yesterday?  Yeah.  How did that go yesterday for everybody?  Oh, it went fantastic.  All the laws are passed now and they're all American citizens. 
[00:24:00]  No, it did nothing.  And it's not going to do anything.  It plugged up the streets.  It's not going to do anything.  It would change the entire country.  Yeah.  They can't do this.  We don't change the entire country.  No.  Sometimes it's a good thing.  Sometimes it's a really bad thing.  But we don't change the entire country ever, ever, ever.  There are some bad things going on with immigration.  You know, a lot of bad things.  But you can't just all of a sudden, all right, if you're in, you're in.  All right.  We'll give it to you. 
[00:24:30]  It doesn't work like that.  We all fake it.  We all make like it's bad and you shouldn't be coming up here and it's bad.  We shouldn't be hiring you.  But it's the way it is.  It's kind of with a wink.  You know, you go, all right.  Don't.  Hey, don't you come over the border to pick that.  Pick that lettuce.  There's American workers that want to do that.  No, there isn't really.  They're not going to pick strawberries.  Shit like that.  That's like the Mexicans jobs that come up.  California.  That's all we saw.  All the stables that I used to board horses at and ride at. 
[00:25:00]  Everyone that worked at those places were illegal Mexicans.  Yeah.  You know, no American guy wanted to cart around a wheelbarrow.  I swear for 10 hours a day, this Mexican guy would cart around a wheelbarrow and clean horse shit out of the horse stalls.  That's all he did all day long.  And we used to just give him like a course.  We'd give him a beer and he would pick it up with his pinky.  He'd put his pinky in the can and pick up his wheelbarrow and just walk away. 
[00:25:30]  This little skinny Mexican guy.  And that was it all day.  And you know what it comes down to?  Like these jobs that no one else wants that the immigrants take?  Yeah.  For the most part, they're normal people.  And they don't know any better.  They were brought up really, really poor.  But they're normal people.  Like if you did get Whitey or anyone in America to do those shitty jobs, you know they're fucking whacked.  You know they're fucking crazy.  Yeah.  You know they got severe fucking problems that you're going to have to deal with. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  No one really takes those jobs.  And all of America understands this.  But they don't, like you said, we don't like talking about it.  If we had a big, great depression going on, then every American would need every job, you know.  Like the friggin' 30s or 20s when the depression was when they're selling the bread and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Then we would need the jobs.  Right now, I think you could get something a little better than cleaning horse shit or picking strawberries.  They're relatively normal people that come from a shitty existence. 
[00:26:30]  A lot of them have families back home and they're just trying to make money for their families to either bring them here or go back with a nice payroll.  Yeah.  For the most part.  For the most part.  There are some that come here, get pregnant, their kids have citizenship, and then it's easier for them to get citizenship.  I worked a couple summers.  Welfare.  I forgot what the company's called, but basically you show up somewhere every day and they give you some shitty job to do.  I needed money for college.  So I was like a dishwasher in the middle of a restaurant in Walt Whitman Mall. 
[00:27:00]  That was like on the third floor of like, I don't know, Bloomingdale's or whatever it was at the time.  How long did that last?  That one only lasted a day or two because the guy in charge was actually retarded.  The guy in charge was actually retarded.  The boss.  So this is where my info comes from.  He was a white guy who was retarded and he was my boss.  Jesus.  And I was like, I can't deal with this. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  You know, because he's yelling and screaming at me and he was partially retarded.  Well, that's a shit job, dishwashing.  And I had a lot of those shit jobs and that's when you notice all the other people showing up for these shit jobs.  You're either trying to make a few bucks so you can go back to college and buy your books and buy your booze and buy, you know, whatever, a pair of jeans or the latest sneaks, whatever.  You know, that's what I had to do.  Or you're some, like, 30-some-odd-year-old dude that smoked crack and this is how you get by. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  You know?  There's not a guy that, like, maybe got downsized from a computer company applying to pick celery.  No.  Or clean horse shit or wash dishes.  Right.  It doesn't really happen.  No.  And that's why this whole immigration thing works.  With a wink.  Everyone goes, with a wink.  All right.  We understand what's going on.  It's not right.  It's not supposed to.  But that is it.  You can't then come out and say, we want this, this, this. 
[00:28:30]  No, don't you understand?  This is all under the table shit.  Right.  We all know it's happening and it's not supposed to.  This is how it works.  And they also work their asses off because they know any day it could end.  Right.  I mean.  They're back in the truck, cross the border.  You know what I mean?  Yep.  That's a work incentive.  Yeah.  It certainly is.  All of a sudden, it's like everything is hunky-dory.  Make money while you can.  Who are we kidding?  In America, when you know you're set up nice in a job, you don't work as hard.  You don't work as hard.  You make believe you work as the boss walks by your cubicle. 
[00:29:00]  Mm-hmm.  But we all try to fuck off as much as possible.  You're not using that computer all day long for business, are you?  That's one of the biggest things now you just need to read about.  Most people at work in their cubicles use their computer for maybe two hours of work a day.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Maybe.  The rest is personal stuff.  Check my email.  Porno.  A little IM chatting.  A little webcam action. 
[00:29:30]  Someone sent me a video.  I've got to see this.  Porno if the stupid tech guy in your company hasn't figured out how to block all that shit  out, but for the most part, unfortunately, most companies have it all blocked out.  I have his workarounds, too.  Workarounds, but that's the reality of it.  Games.  These immigrants, they work really hard because they know it can end tomorrow.  Mm-hmm.  So we get a good day's work out of them.  Good day's work out of them.  Absolutely.  And everybody knows that.  Yeah.  But like you say, it's all on the shit. 
[00:30:00]  Hey, keep it on the QT.  We know that you know.  We get the shitty jobs done.  You get money that's worth a lot more down in Mexico when they go down there.  Leave it at that.  You want wine?  You want benefit?  Oh, look.  You're ruining it.  You're ruining the system.  Yeah.  Just go back to Mexico and let them give you benefits.  Yeah.  Which is shitty water and kidnappings.  Right.  There's your benefits.  You got, you know, there are at least, what, a couple of million people all over the country 
[00:30:30]  protesting in various cities.  If all those people went to Mexico, there you go.  You'd make a little impact.  You'd make some noise.  You know, worry about making Mexico a great place that has a lot of jobs and things like that.  You ever see, I'm sure you haven't, but did you ever see,  an aerial, a satellite shot of vegetation from America and Mexico? 
[00:31:00]  Yes.  You could distinctly see the border line just based on nothing more than vegetation.  Where did you see this, Anthony?  Because I can't quite remember.  I think it was Discovery Channel, but you can absolutely see the border just based on  the vegetation because the irrigation is there for us.  We work.  Kip, we have something else in common because I was thinking the same thing the other day.  Jesus.  But it's the same.  I was looking at Gawker Stalker.  My silly point being the dirt is no different north of the Rio Grande than it is south. 
[00:31:30]  So what is the difference?  It's not being irrigated properly, fertilized.  They don't have the resources.  And why don't they?  They got all these people.  They come up here and work.  Just do it down there.  Make your country kick ass.  You're a silly boy.  They had good intentions and all those fields were nicely planted, but everyone trying  to make their way to America is just trompling over some good fruit and vegetables. 
[00:32:00]  What are you doing?  I was trying to plant.  Oh, you see your footprints.  So, you know, the protests yesterday and the marches were real, they were cute.  They had their day.  It was nice.  It was really good.  Yeah.  It was really good.  Now everyone will just forget about it.  But now, because this is America, I think we need to just kind of throw it like you just  banned people on Pal Talk for no reason.  I think we should drive around with a few trucks outside the Home Depots, start tossing 
[00:32:30]  some people out, go in the back door of some of these restaurants.  Banned.  You, you, you get in the truck and you're going back.  Oh, that's what they should have done at the protest.  And then the word gets out there, we're not going to have any more marches.  And people get back in the field, back in the kitchens, go to the field and say, you,  you, and you.  Back door of the restaurants, like I said, the Home Depots, the landscaping businesses.  The guys they didn't pick are sitting there going, oh, I better keep my mouth shut.  But I better tell Jose and the rest that this is going down. 
[00:33:00]  We better shut up.  Everyone better shut up.  You know, they have that underground network.  The word will get out quickly and efficiently.  Absolutely.  And then we don't have to wait around while the march goes by in our cars and we can get  home faster.  Like yesterday, traffic.  Is that politically correct?  Um, no.  Let's say hi to David in Atlanta.  David, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Been listening to you for years. 
[00:33:30]  When I lived in Boston, when I lived near New York and Jersey, I'll tell you what,  about killed me when you guys got punched off the air for a couple years.  Yeah.  Bastards.  We're going to be around for a while this time.  Good deal.  I bought XM just because I heard you guys were on it.  Go ahead.  Thanks, bro.  Um, down here in Georgia, it's been interesting.  There's been politicians doing some exposés and it's been on the news on and off now.  Even made CNN.  Excuse me.  They were talking about how the day laborers, depending upon if they're in cotton fields or 
[00:34:00]  working for some of the construction workers, are getting paid 10 or 15 bucks an hour.  The last time I checked, there's plenty of American white people that would love a 10 or 15 dollar  an hour job.  So they really are kind of taking some of the positions down here where they get off cheap  because they don't have to pay any insurance or any taxes on them.  Oh, so they give them, uh...  They're really not taking the place.  Pretty good cash.  They're not taking jobs away, though, man.  These are all jobs no one else wants.  I don't know.  Everyone has known that for many, many years, that these are the jobs no one really wants 
[00:34:30]  and that's why this whole thing works for everybody.  Day laborers or something?  What are they doing?  Well, they're day laborers, but on construction sites and stuff.  I think there's a few Americans that take that.  I don't know how many people want to go back and pick cotton, though.  I mean, I can see your point there.  Most of the Americans, most of the American guys on the job sites are the skilled portion  of the labor, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  You know, the carpenters, the roofers, things like that, not the cement guys. 
[00:35:00]  But the Mexicans are usually the day laborers that go up and sweep up afterwards, clean up.  They're the gophers.  All right.  Well, they also went a little bit further and they started doing a comparison.  One of the politicians on the floor of the Georgia House was shooting off his mouth saying,  we can't deport them.  There's all these great minds and they have an opportunity to get scholarships at Emory University.  Even if you deport them, then we're killing the future of not just our country, the world. 
[00:35:30]  And then they were saying, you can't have it both ways.  They're either going for the unskilled jobs or are they going for our college degrees.  We've got enough good minds here.  We don't need to import $8 million to get five smart guys.  It's stupid.  That's exactly right.  That's just a dumb...  I guarantee you ever said that was a Democrat.  Well, this is the deep Bible Belt South.  That's right.  All right, boys.  Have a good morning.  All right.  What does that mean it was the Bible Belt South?  I don't know.  That's why I said that's right.  Jim in Ohio.  Jim, let's go, buddy.  We're off to a pretty good start here. 
[00:36:00]  Hello, Jim.  Hey, guys.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, Jim.  I've got a retarded guy.  He's 42 years old.  He pushes a trash bin from the restaurant down to the dumpster.  He's been doing it for 20 years.  Garbage.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable, man.  No, it's not.  It's completely believable.  Yeah, what do you want him to do?  What else would he do?  Well, that's pretty much it.  I was just in shock when he goes, yeah, I've been here for 20 years.  I'm like, you've got to be careful.  He does a good job.  Sure he does.  He doesn't complain. 
[00:36:30]  Any normal person would be bitching every single day about that shitty job.  Gets garbage juice on his fingers, then eats a cookie without washing his hands.  He doesn't even care.  He's a good sport.  Licks him.  He don't care.  All right, Jim.  Let's go to Angela.  Angela, what's up?  Angela?  Angela.  Oh, hi, guys.  Sorry about that.  Howdy.  Hi, how you doing?  All right.  You were talking before about the surgery with the electrodes into the brain and then with  the battery pack.  Yeah.  I had that done three weeks ago. 
[00:37:00]  In your brain?  No, in my spine.  They could do it for anything.  They go up and down the spine depending on what your problem is.  They insert the electrodes and then they put a battery pack in the top of your butt.  They actually sew it in.  You could feel it.  And then like electrodes shoot.  For mine, it was into the bladder.  And they shoot it into the back.  Were you wetting yourself?  No, actually, that was the one thing I didn't do.  I had a lot of other problems.  But that was, according to insurance, yeah, I do.  But that was the one thing that I was trying to do.  What was happening with your bladder? 
[00:37:30]  I had a lot of surgeries and my bladder was just like destroyed from like caesareans and  all sorts of things.  So I was having a lot of problems.  Were you incontinent?  No, no.  No.  That's the one.  It's called an urge incontinent.  I had to like go like 25 times a day.  Oh, just you got the feeling like you had to go.  Wait, I have that.  What could that be from?  Cancer.  No, it's not from cancer.  Cancer.  I don't know.  Like with a man, it could be, you know, prostrate.  Swollen prostate.  Prostrate.  The only thing I had was typically with women. 
[00:38:00]  Prostrate.  Could it be my prostate's fat?  Because after I jack off, I always have to pee a lot.  Like I whacked off last night.  Eight times I'm up.  So I wonder if it swells the old prostate up.  See, one of my problem was.  Did you have a lot of liquid before you had your orgasm?  No.  I actually could not have.  I don't have a lot of liquid.  I wound up just having.  The dual interview.  I love it.  Well, no, I don't.  It just happens to me all the time.  I can't jack off before I get on a plane.  Why?  Because I'll be peeing every three minutes.  It's awful.  I just stand there and a couple of drops come out. 
[00:38:30]  It's time for you to, you know.  What?  I've done that.  It was fine.  A couple of fingers and it was all right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A couple?  Yeah.  What doctor is using a couple of fingers?  Oh, no, no.  It was a massage therapist.  He straightened me right out.  Oh, prostate good.  So what, yeah, you felt like you had to pee and then what do they do?  They keep you awake while they did the electrodes?  That was the most awful part.  They do, before they permanently insert it into you, you kind of walk around with like a battery pack on your, you know, like a beeper. 
[00:39:00]  And I had to be awake so they could actually see like my toes curl or like certain spasms to know that they were in the right part of the spot.  And my legs would just like shoot out and kick.  And when they knew they had the right spot, they knew what to look for.  And then it was so successful, it worked really well that they inserted it permanently.  And, you know, I have like a remote control.  And I, this remote control, I could, you know, turn it on, turn it off, turn it up, turn it down. 
[00:39:30]  So when you have to take a leak, what do you do?  You just zap yourself and...  No, no, that's not, when it's worse, when I feel like it's not working, I turn it up.  But you're supposed to just get it at the point where you, it's just helping.  Do you have to plug yourself into a charger?  No, well, no, the remote has a battery and I have the battery pack and you just like aim the remote at it.  If the battery pack is inside you, how do they change the batteries?  Every like 10 years, I'll probably have to go back and have it changed.  That's a hell of a battery.  Why can't they put those in like cell phones? 
[00:40:00]  Oh, you know they can, but they won't.  Bastards, yeah.  Every 10 years.  Look at that.  All right, how's your sex life?  I don't know, yeah.  I only had the surgery three weeks ago, so I still haven't...  Three weeks?  Yeah, you're going to have to hide all that stuff when you want to have sex.  Hey, how did that happen with you with the C-section?  What about?  If I got pregnant.  I would assume if she had a C-section, she was pregnant.  What happened?  Like the baby step on your bladder or something?  I just think that I didn't heal well from the surgeries and just three of them was too 
[00:40:30]  much for me.  And after the third one, I was just like wrecked.  Three C-sections?  Yeah.  Oh my God, just leave it open.  Just leave your womb open in the front.  Put saran wrap over it.  Jesus Christ.  Another kid, zip, just a Ziploc bag thing they could surgically put in your belly.  You're lower of a rope ladder, the kid climbs out.  Everything's good.  You know, Ethel Kennedy had 11 C-sections.  All of those, what's his face, Robert F. Kennedy, all of those kids he has, every single one 
[00:41:00]  of them were C-sections.  That's because the Kennedy's like a tight box.  Yeah.  Nice.  All right.  Three isn't too bad.  All right, Angela.  You ain't having one out of your box.  Smack her around a little bit.  Let's go to Mike of Long Island.  Mike.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  I own a construction company in Long Island.  I've owned it for 15 years, okay?  I guarantee you there are no white guys willing to do this job.  I've tried.  Every white guy I get lasts about two weeks and then they quake.  What are they?  The guy with the rolling garbage can in the broom, right? 
[00:41:30]  No, no, no, no.  It's a concrete company.  Okay?  So it's, you know, laboring, you know, humping forms up and down the hill.  And I guarantee you there's no white guys.  They don't want to do it.  I was watching them building the house next door and it's all Mexican guys.  And they, yeah, they take these huge, heavy forms off the truck and they put them up.  They pour the cement and then they got to take these forms a couple of days later.  All of them take them down, put them back.  They're walking on these boards that are like, you know, a little two by six from the foundation 
[00:42:00]  to the dirt, carrying these huge forms in the wind.  They don't care.  They lose one Mexican.  Nah, how hard is it to get another, right?  There's two.  Everybody says, oh, you don't want to give them benefits.  That's not the truth.  The problem is people don't want to pay $50,000 for a foundation.  They want to pay, you know, $15,000 for a foundation.  Bring in the illegals.  It's just a problem.  Nobody wants to pay.  You get rid of all the day laborers you watch.  Nobody's going to go back to cutting their own grass. 
[00:42:30]  They're going to do their own work anymore because who wants to pay $100 a week to get  your grass cut?  Right.  And that's who you'd be paying with American labor.  You hire a landscaper.  You don't want to pay a lot of money.  And besides, Americans are just lazy people and they just don't want to work.  We're not lazy.  We just all feel like we're more entitled and we shouldn't be doing that.  Everybody likes to feel like they're important here in America.  All of us Americans love to feel like we're better than picking vegetables, washing dishes, 
[00:43:00]  no matter who you are, no matter what your level of education.  No matter what color, no matter what level of education.  You feel that you're better than that.  So you don't want to take those jobs.  My father started this job 40 years ago.  He had a dime in his pocket when he came over to Ellis Island.  No, but the problem is there's never been Americans doing this work.  It was either Italians doing it, then the Portuguese did it, now the Mexicans are doing it.  Never Americans.  Never.  So you're saying it's not based on race, religion, or creed. 
[00:43:30]  All right, Mikey.  What is creed?  I don't know.  I've never known what creed is.  A lousy band with a pompous singer.  Leo in Jersey.  What's up, Leo?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I just want to let you guys know I also got the XM when I heard you guys were back on.  Thanks, Leo.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You know, I believe that if the employers would pay the right amount of money and give the benefits,  that there would be more Americans willing to do this job.  Yeah, but dude, that's what the other guy was just saying.  We don't want to pay the byproduct of that. 
[00:44:00]  If all of a sudden Americans are getting these jobs, they want the benefits, they want the  compensation, and now a landscaping job that would cost you $100 now costs you $500 because  of all the overhead that the company has.  We as Americans don't want to pay that.  We're taking our jobs away from us because I'm a truck driver, and I go to a warehouse  sometimes.  I'm not going to say the name.  And all the forks are run by the Mexicans. 
[00:44:30]  And the first time I was there, you know, they're getting paid $12 an hour, no benefits,  no overtime, nothing, minimum pay.  And $12,000 an hour is a pretty good pay.  And on top of that, the one that was offloading my truck was running like in low gear.  I'm looking at the guy next to me.  He's running in high gear.  I'm like, what the hell's going on?  Why is this guy running faster than my guy offloading my truck?  He goes, oh, you got to duke these guys another $20 or $30, and then they run in high gear.  So these guys are getting spoiled. 
[00:45:00]  No, people don't want to pay.  That's what it is.  We always bitch about outsourcing and shit like that.  Oh, this company moved their operation to India or somewhere like that.  And we bitch about it, but we don't want to pay high prices for shit.  You can't have both in this day and age.  In this day and age.  You're not going to get a bunch of, you know, college kids, honest, hardworking college kids  from an episode of Leave It to Beaver that are going to be out there doing these jobs like the old days.  That's what it was back in the older days. 
[00:45:30]  It was a bunch of kids in between going to school and adulthood that would do these jobs.  Now Mexicans.  All right, let's go to Doug in New Hampshire.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, Doug.  Hey, I think you're looking at this all the wrong way.  All right.  I'll tell you why.  Give me a minute, all right?  All right, Doug.  Take your time.  Floor's yours.  All right.  You hire a Mexican, right?  Right.  He works for you for a year.  I'm an employer.  I pay his taxes.  He pays the government, right?  Now in a year, I file his W-2. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Government says, hey, this is a bogus Social Security number.  I need a real one.  So I go back to Warren.  I say, look, you gave me a bad Social Security.  He quits.  Guess what happens?  What?  The government keeps their money.  They keep my money.  Times that, times 12 million.  The government's not ready to pass the law to let immigrants work here.  They can't afford it.  That's all free money they're keeping.  Free money.  He sees it as some kind of a little loophole for the government to make some extra money. 
[00:46:30]  Well, sir, let me ask you.  You don't get any of that back.  Hold on, sir.  Sir.  Sir.  Sir.  You got to think the government's.  I have a question.  You know, understand what's going on.  They could easily stop this if they wanted to.  But are you paying benefits on this guy or tax on this guy?  Or is it just kind of under the table where you're giving him cash and telling nobody?  You can go to Chicago and get yourself a legitimate social security number, per se.  Got to go to Chicago?  Why Chicago, sir?  What's happening in Chicago? 
[00:47:00]  What is it, like MASH?  Little Chicago?  Meh.  I don't know.  There's a place up there they go to go.  You got to see Al Capone.  You can hire this guy with a social security number.  He pays taxes to the government.  And then in a year, government keeps it all.  What kind of business do you have?  Do you own AnnoyingVoices.com?  Well, I'm Italian.  It's like, that's not the case.  That is Chicago.  And then, uh, what?  No, I think it's just a point that a lot of people are missing. 
[00:47:30]  All right, Doug.  You can't afford it.  All right.  Thanks for your input, Doug.  What kind of work do you do, Doug?  I'd rather not say.  I just wanted to say.  All right.  Thank you, 1930s voice in New Hampshire.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  I'm in the syrup business up here in New Hampshire.  See?  Watch out for the coppers, Doug.  Meh.  Meh.  Revenoe are quick.  Take an axe to the still.  Meh.  Let's go to South Carolina.  South Carolina, what's going on today?  Actually, my wife and I were stuck on a bus for 44 hours coming back from Cancun, Mexico. 
[00:48:00]  We had an accident on the plane ride over with our ears rupturing.  And then I got to talk to this Mexican guy who was on his way to Texas to work, and he  said that...  It's the beginning of his story.  Better than what he's going into.  We've been talking about the Mexicans and stuff, and that's all fine and well.  It's a big issue in the news today.  But you talk about being stuck on a bus for how many hours?  44 hours.  44 hours and your ears rupturing on a plane? 
[00:48:30]  You can't just leave that.  Oh, I thought he said the gears.  I swear.  I swear they did.  No, his...  He spent half of our vacation in a Cancun, Mexico hospital.  With ruptured eardrums?  Yeah.  It's pretty common if you fly with like an ear infection or something like that, or like  a sinus infection, that it actually...  Great.  When they decompress...  Thanks for giving Jimmy something else to worry about.  A little more paranoia.  I got to fly tomorrow, sir.  I'm a little scared.  Hey, Jimmy.  I had the sinus surgery done, the deviated septum, by the way. 
[00:49:00]  Septum.  And it is true.  But it doesn't...  The breather eyes do help.  Yes, I know.  But did the surgery help?  A little bit, man.  It's a real pain in the ass, though, when you...  The first three or four days...  Let's keep it clean, sir.  So what about the eardrums?  Like, I always have like bad...  I don't have sinus infection.  They ruptured.  Are you going to be okay?  Oh, yeah.  It's pretty common, actually, the specialist ear.  Down there, the specialist, you know, they don't really...  No, we don't care now.  No, but I mean, they're not permanently damaged.  It does not sound like a ruptured eardrum sound like you're never going to be able to  hear again?  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  Can you hear me, sir?  What?  Sir?  Yeah, I can hear you.  I hear you, buddy.  All right, can we move on?  Listen, I just want to tell you this.  The Mexican guy, the reason why they are so willing to work so hard here, a lot of Mexico  is not like Cancun.  It's real...  It's terrible.  And this guy told me, he said that when he was on his way here, that he was making 100  pesos a week.  Wow.  Which is $10 U.S. money, roughly.  Oh, that's different, then.  So when they get here, you know, they're making... 
[00:50:00]  If they're only making $5, $6, $7 an hour...  Let me get my calculator.  ...they're killing it.  Five, six.  They're killing it, yeah.  So what you're saying is that they wind up, when they ship back American dollars, they're  making a lot more.  A lot more.  After you told that story, I wish my eardrums were ruptured.  Let's go to Andy in Washington.  Andy!  Hey.  All I hire is these Hondurans and Guatemalans.  We dig trenches for cable and fiber optic lines.  Yeah.  These guys work for $100 a day. 
[00:50:30]  They show up every day.  They work hard.  And, I mean, granted, the crew chiefs have to get screwed a little bit on taxes, because  we tell them we, you know, hire day labor.  But, and these guys are sending money home.  And they're very, very happy in general.  So good.  They're very happy with what they have in America.  All I requested about the immigrants is learn to speak English.  Well, who's going to dig...  Well, I got a black crew chief.  And he had black guys working for one day, and they quit. 
[00:51:00]  They quit.  They didn't want to dig ditches.  Nah, I don't need this.  No.  Yeah.  All I want works for IBM and shit.  When they said...  Yeah, I mean, you know...  The Hondurans and the...  And they don't like the Mexicans, by the way.  Those guys from El Salvador and stuff.  Well, so what kind of...  Get over here and they gotta pay.  The Mexicans...  How long have they had that kind of tension?  Pardon?  Between the Hondurans and the Mexicans.  Come on, Jimmy.  Has there been a problem between Hondurans and Mexicans?  I didn't know that.  I'm serious.  Yes. 
[00:51:30]  Yes.  Well, the Hondurans and El Salvadorians, they all don't like...  Because when they come up through there, they have to pay the Mexicans to get in the United States.  Do you ever notice at a party when you're standing there that everyone just walks away from you?  All right.  And you're talking.  Hondurans and the Mexicans.  Hello.  Oh, drink.  You sit there eating doodads alone.  All right.  Thank you, Andy.  Let's go to Pat in South Carolina.  Pat.  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are you?  Good.  Hi, girl's name.  I just wanted to comment that I think, you know, people have missed the principle when 
[00:52:00]  it comes to this wave of immigration.  I mean, Anthony, you're Italian.  I'm Irish.  But the fact of the matter is that when they cite previous waves of immigration, you know,  we all assimilated and did so very quickly.  There's nothing you can point to today and say there is an Italian culture in America.  There's an Irish culture.  A little Italy and stuff, but Italians...  Organized crime.  Yeah.  I'm just saying that, you know, there's been an active resistance to assimilation in the  Hispanic community, and that's where I think the backlash comes when it comes to people  feeling threatened by them.  I agree.  It's not just Hispanic. 
[00:52:30]  It's a lot of, like, in the last, I guess, X amount of years, it's a resistance to assimilation.  That's exactly what it is.  Because Italian culture and, like, you know, Irish culture and a lot of crap became a part  of American culture.  Like, you know what I mean?  They kind of went into making American culture, too.  Yeah.  But all you ask is just learn the language and assimilate to American culture, and people will  be much more tolerant.  But we've made it so easy that you don't have to do that anymore.  I was flipping around the channels last night, and there's, like, my cable service has 10  HBO channels that are in Spanish.  Yeah.  See?  Like, 10! 
[00:53:00]  It's not even...  You need that.  Not even one anymore.  It's a whole slew of channels that's broadcast in Spanish.  Do you need that?  No.  You don't?  No.  Well, Jimmy made the point about, you know...  Like, why would you learn English at this point in America?  Why?  You don't need to.  It's everywhere.  It's the newspapers and the magazines.  They're all coming out now in all sorts of different languages.  Instead of having to assimilate to American society and then using a piece of your culture  to make America better, which is what a lot of the immigrants did years ago, everyone 
[00:53:30]  now comes over and expects America to bend over backwards to respect your culture.  You're supposed to take a piece of your culture and incorporate it into America to make America  a better place, not us have to assimilate to you.  But my culture calls for me to wear this on my head, yeah?  Well, then go back to the shithole you come from.  You know what, though?  We did it to ourselves.  We did it to ourselves.  We have ourselves to blame.  Anthony was talking the other...  I'm not blaming me.  Anthony was talking the other day, just the stupid street signs in New York. 
[00:54:00]  Now they're just symbols and stuff.  Walk, don't walk.  Because we know there's a lot of people out there that don't know how to speak English  or read it or write it or what have you.  They still don't understand.  Instead of having the don't walk sign was the recent example.  The red hand.  Now it's a red hand because other cultures and other people that speak other language  can understand that instead of the actual English that just says don't walk.  And the green walking guy.  I like the green walking guy.  He's my favorite.  He's dishy.  I love when he pops up. 
[00:54:30]  If you look at the two groups that claim to have been held back the most on account of  their ethnicity, blacks and Hispanics, I think a case could also be made to say that  they're the two groups that have done the most to segregate themselves from mainstream  America culturally.  Now that seems to be a problem.  And I think at some point they're hurting themselves.  I think blacks and Hispanics are in different groups because of the history America has with  black people.  It's a little bit different, sir.  Naturally.  But I mean, you can't discount that there's kind of an ongoing movement to have a black  culture within America.  Oh, but you can discount it. 
[00:55:00]  You're absolutely correct, sir.  I don't know what that means.  I would discount it.  Well, thank you, gentlemen.  I love the show.  I have XM in my home.  I car everything.  And I really enjoy it.  And Mr. Norton, I hope to see you and David Tell in Atlantic City at the Borgata.  Thank you, Bob.  All right.  There you go.  It's not available at Ticketmaster.  No, the Borgata.com, you geese.  All right.  Well, that's one of the big stories today, obviously.  Yeah, a lot of people clamoring about that one.  It was the March went on yesterday, and it was terrific for everybody.  Oh, it was great for everybody that works here in New York City. 
[00:55:30]  Now get back to work.  Yeah.  I mean, just get back in the kitchen.  Wash.  Scrub those pots.  Scrub the pots and pans.  Get back to work.  Don't spit in my food, though, please.  All right.  We got some things to do.  We still got to do the Rosie O'Donnell gay cruise thing.  The gay cruise.  I was watching some of the video in the office.  Oh, my God.  Oh, none of the women in this video have to worry about the deck being windy to musk their hair. 
[00:56:00]  I swear to you.  All right.  We'll talk about that next.  Aaron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation, three-time champion, All-American AAU champion.  Pleasure for me today.  Anthony and Opium bring me here to New York.  I say hello to all my wrestling fans.  And everybody know I'm the real Middle Eastern man.  Come to the greatest wrestling country and most famous city in the world. 
[00:56:30]  Manhattan, Madison Square Garden.  I come three-time champion.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, especially All-American and also my Iranian friend.  I want to say hello to all the world.  Aaron Sheik, Khosrow, Wazir, and I want to say hello to all my friends.  Pleasure for me to come back here again one more time to I talk to the Opium and Anthony and pleasure for me always.  Hey, you're crazy bitch, but you're fucked so good. 
[00:57:00]  I'm on top of it when I dream.  I'm doing you all night.  Stouch yourself down my back to keep around.  Hey, you're crazy bitch, but you're fucked so good.  But I'm on top of it when I dream.  I'm doing you all night.  Stouch yourself down my back to keep around.  This song's dirty.  That's the brand new Buck Cherry.  That's dirty.  Crazy bitch.  We're back with the Opium and Anthony program.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We greatly appreciate it. 
[00:57:30]  Yes, we do.  Big hi to Pal Talk.  Big hi to the Pest.  Hi.  Big hi to the casual listeners.  And a big hi to everyone that just happened to stumble upon us today.  Right.  Oops.  Who is this?  What is this show?  Because they don't like the song on top tracks right now.  Yeah.  Hi to you too.  You know that happens every day.  Someone just clicking around.  I've talked to a lot of people that found us on DirecTV.  A lot of people just stumble on us.  They trip.  Oops.  Oops.  What the hell is this? 
[00:58:00]  What the?  Who the?  And they're the whatsa?  And then they're brand new huge fans of the show.  Yeah.  And that's why we call it the ONA virus.  Yeah.  Because then you get kind of infected and then you kind of pass it on to somebody else.  So that's kind of cool.  Like being coughed on.  Where's Jimmy?  He's pissed off about alternative comics.  I don't even know.  I wasn't really listening.  Jimmy gets mad and leaves.  Jimmy, you get mad and then leave.  Why?  Jimmy gets mad.  We were starting this break with you and you leave.  Why didn't they know you were starting the break with you guys?  So then me and Anthony had to like just kind of do filler crap that means nothing to anybody. 
[00:58:30]  I thought that was good.  We were thanking the listeners.  Why didn't they know you were starting the break?  We didn't really need to thank the listeners.  I had to piss.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm pissed.  We just stopped for ten minutes.  I went and pissed.  All right.  What's going on with the alternative comic day?  All I know is I'm just so sick of alternative comedians.  I am so sick of these.  What's the definition of an alternative comedian?  Not funny.  A guy who isn't funny.  Alternate to funny.  Exactly. 
[00:59:00]  Who wears little glasses, who probably doesn't need them and needs people who think like-minded  politically to sit around and tell them how clever they are.  This is how you laugh at alternative comic.  Oh.  Good example would be Janine Garofalo.  Yes.  Ugh.  Who I actually thought was funny years ago.  I'm just sick and tired of them attacking Larry the Cable Guy.  I've had enough of these fucking douchebags attacking Larry the Cable Guy.  Like, wow.  That's a big, dangerous target.  Why are you attacking Larry the Cable Guy? 
[00:59:30]  Gator Dunn.  All right.  We get it.  It's not your thing.  Who fucking cares?  Why not go after Carlos Mencia?  Or go after a black comic for shit like that.  Homophobia and racism.  That's what they have a problem with Larry the Cable Guy?  It's fucking mind-boggling.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  There's other comedians going after Larry the Cable Guy because I wasn't really listening.  David Cross and Larry got into it.  David fucking Cross.  Well, no.  He's really brilliant.  You just got to listen close.  I don't know what started it with them. 
[01:00:00]  I read David's response.  Dude, I saw David Cross because everyone was talking about David Cross this, David Cross  that, blah, blah, blah.  I was in Boston doing, I don't even know.  Maybe we were broadcasting live and I was looking for something to do.  I don't remember the details.  And I went to Bill Blumenreich's fine club up there, the Comedy Connection, to see David  Cross.  That fucking guy was too cool for the fucking room.  Unprepared.  Acting like he's just winging it, man, on stage.  Man.  Had kind of a notebook because the alternative comic has to have the notebook to the side 
[01:00:30]  of the stage.  On the stool.  Look, man, I'm so cool and don't even have time to do this in my down time because I'm  too busy marching for causes.  I'm just dropping in, man.  I'm just dropping in and I got some thoughts.  This wasn't even scheduled.  Got some thoughts and a pen.  I'm just detached, man.  Man.  I write it down, man.  I sat there and I got such an open mind for comedy.  I try to see everybody.  What do I got?  What do I got on the notebook here?  What do I got?  Just perusing.  Hey, you know, you know. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, George Bush, man.  You know, it was so bad that the people at the Comedy Connection that night couldn't  wait for the bills, their checks to arrive at the table.  Check.  Yeah, when you hear people at the Comedy Club asking for the check.  Because then at that point, they at least have something to do, especially with their  hands.  Yeesh.  My problem with these guys, again, is the reason that to me they're such phonies.  And sorry, because I'm trashing them, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. 
[01:01:30]  I love Arrested Development, and he was on that, and he was very funny on that.  Absolutely.  But his stand-up, I couldn't stomach.  I am generalizing because I think they are all so predictable politically.  Every one of them thinks the same.  And the fact, I don't know what got Cross and Larry the Cable Guy into it.  I know Rolling Stone, a magazine that I would love to put fucking anthrax in the vents.  Just a bunch of predictable douches, musically and every other way.  Of course they attacked Larry the Cable Guy, the white hillbilly who did some gay jokes. 
[01:02:00]  Of course that's who they go after.  Give me the latest issue of Rolling Stone.  I want to challenge you on that.  What's wrong with Rolling Stone?  I like the Rolling Stone.  It stinks, and they've never liked things I like, so I hate them.  A little too left-leaning?  Left-leaning?  Jesus.  They collapsed years ago.  And of course they go after Larry the Cable Guy.  I was being sarcastic, by the way.  All right.  You know, that's what really irritates me, is the way that they act like they're doing something dangerous. 
[01:02:30]  Like, Larry's this target, and I would love to know who started it, Cross or him.  I imagine Cross did.  So now they're just battling each other?  Larry trashed him.  He trashed him.  Whoever started it.  But now this kid, Stephen Hofstetter, from Sirius Radio, I didn't even know he was on Sirius.  He's known as the Thinking Man's Comic.  Oh, well, that should say it all right there.  How many people are going to be known as the Thinking Man's Comic, by the way?  I've heard that phrase many times as far as comedy goes. 
[01:03:00]  And I'm the Thinking Man's Comic.  And is this the cover of his CD?  I do not.  Oh, is it really?  He actually links himself with the Cable Guy.  It's called Cure for the Cable Guy.  He has a doll, like a dress like Larry the Cable Guy hung.  But it's like, are you actually making him on your cover of your CD?  Like, how fucking phony is that?  If that's really his CD cover, Jesus is that fraudulent.  That, to me, is trying to link yourself with a much bigger name just to try to create controversy to sell some product, man. 
[01:03:30]  Just be honest about what it is.  And there's apparently emails on his site.  Eric, is this where this is from?  Yeah.  Like, people that didn't like what he said about Larry the Cable Guy.  And his response, one of the guys wrote, Larry the Cable Guy is a better comedian than you will ever be.  He speaks the truth, and you just don't know it.  You are living in your own little world.  If you think anybody of the blue-collar TV sucks, well, I don't like the fucking guy that wrote the hate mail either.  He's also an idiot.  But then the guy, Steven's response is, I would love to hear what truth Larry speaks. 
[01:04:00]  And if racism, homophobia, and ignorance are the truth, I would gladly live in a different world.  Oh, shut up.  Racism.  Did you have anything to say about Eddie Griffin's act or any other black performers?  The same way that fucking Jane Borden from Time Out magazine wouldn't criticize Chappelle for saying nigger.  The same way you are going after Larry the Cable Guy.  Stop picking such a safe target and acting like what you're doing is fucking telling it like it is. 
[01:04:30]  Just stop acting like you're fucking telling it like it is.  Because you only attack the same type of ideology.  Blue-collar TV.  To be honest, I don't think it's funny.  I think it's a bunch of...  And the reason...  Oh, this one.  You gotta...  Where's the rest of this one?  He's talking about what comedy...  This is Steven's response to hate mail.  I believe.  What Comedy Central does with its commercials is belittle people from small towns.  They're saying, hey, this is your life.  You should enjoy this because you are...  You should enjoy this because you're poor and ignorant hick too. 
[01:05:00]  How could you not be insulted by that?  I'll never know.  I would be outraged if I were from a small town.  Well, A, Comedy Central is a little fucking PC and cowardly.  The only reason they attack small towns, that's why you're allowed to attack anymore.  Yeah, true.  Little middle-class white people or Midwestern white people are safe targets.  They're not gonna complain to the point where you get shows pulled and...  Yeah, of course not.  Yeah.  How about the way Carlos Mencia might make fun of gang shootings?  Or the way Chappelle made fun of crack addicts?  Why is there no problem with making fun of that?  Mm-hmm.  These fucking guys attack one thing only. 
[01:05:30]  I'm so sick of Larry the Cable Guy being the fucking rallying cry for all these fucking  faggity alternative comics.  Enough.  Who cares?  Let's say hi to Brad in Atlanta.  A lot of calls from Atlanta lately.  Brad, what's up?  Not much, guys.  I'm a big fan of David Cross and of Jimmy and you guys.  I just wanted to say, from what I understand, I saw Cross in like 2002, early 2002 when  he was doing the Shut Up, You Fucking Baby Tour.  And he was just getting tired of everybody yelling out, get her done at his shows.  That's from what I understand where it all started.  Well, this is a guy...  Wait, David Cross is a name. 
[01:06:00]  Now, he prides himself on having his own fan base.  So why would his fans be yelling, get her done?  I don't know if they were his fans or just people who happened to be at the show.  I just, from what I understood, he just got tired of that.  But as far as we're up, it's gone now.  Got no fucking clue.  I'd love to know who started that whole thing.  I imagine he did.  I just can't see Larry doing that.  Yeah, punch it out, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Dave.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to ask, what do you guys think of Larry the Cable Guy? 
[01:06:30]  He was in there last year, and you guys seem to have a pretty good dynamic.  He's a nice dude.  He's a great, nice enough guy.  He really is.  He was fun.  He was very nice.  I'm not into his humor.  You know, that whole hick thing.  I'm from New York.  I don't really, like, get it.  They sell out all over the place.  Arenas.  So I'm not going to sit here and say the guy isn't funny.  A lot of people find him hysterically funny.  I thought he was funny when he came in here.  I don't really get the guilt. 
[01:07:00]  I wouldn't go out of my way to go to a Larry the Cable Guy show, but I thought he did a  great job for us, and I thought some of his stuff was really funny, you know?  I think when we were talking about Oscar winner Larry the Cable Guy because of his movie,  where he's the health inspector, then he'll have the respect that he is due.  Of all the comedians on blue collar, I like Larry the best.  And again, the problem is, why are they not attacking anything like these, that black  or Latin comics say? 
[01:07:30]  That's the problem I have with him.  Not that they think Larry sucks.  That's fine.  You think he sucks.  All right, whatever.  If you want to make fun of him because he stinks, go ahead.  But it's this idea that when they start calling him racist and homophobic man, that's the  problem I have.  You know who would be one of the most racist and homophobic people to attack would be Dave  Chappelle.  He's also one of the most hysterical people to watch on his TV show, the reruns.  You could still watch him and just laugh your balls off.  Why don't they go after Dave Chappelle? 
[01:08:00]  Because they are fucking phonies.  They've goofed on gays.  I think Chappelle's a much better comment.  On race.  Oh, yeah.  Chappelle's hysterical.  But you're right.  That is acceptable.  You'll never see them getting on their soapbox and bashing them.  Hey, you're a racist.  You're homophobic.  I would love to know why they're doing it.  Maybe he trashed David Cross one time and Cross was responding.  I don't know.  I would love to know why is Larry the rallying cry? 
[01:08:30]  Well, let's have him call the freaking show.  Because he's a white guy, which is an easy target right there.  Because other white people don't really rally behind white people that are being accused of anything.  They distance themselves, if anything, to keep from being called a racist or homophobe also.  So the white people, where you get a black guy's accused of something, you'll get other black people to rally around.  White people, if someone's accused of being a racist, he has no friends.  No one's backing him up. 
[01:09:00]  Everyone pulls away.  Larry the cable guy, easy mark, you know, dopey southern hillbilly type.  And not threatening.  If he says something bad about you, who cares?  If a black guy threatens you, that's kind of scary.  And I'd like to know, because they call Larry's audience stupid.  By the way, I'm just saying how these guys think.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  They call the audience stupid, which, you know, the majority of them, maybe.  But, you know, not that the majority of my fans are in fucking medical school either. 
[01:09:30]  As they yell, as they yell, fucking Ramon.  You know, after eight beers.  At least you don't have to stare at a room full of mullets.  What?  My God, man.  Well, until they turn around, you'd be surprised.  That they fucking sport in Philly and Poughkeepsie.  But the...  Poughkeepsie.  Oh, fuck, I had a point.  I forgot it.  Oh, the way they attack his audience, he's being stupid.  Really?  Well, you ever watch BET when they show comedy clips, right?  Where they'll show ten comics.  It's almost like a thing, like themes.  Like, here's the thing about fat mother-in-laws. 
[01:10:00]  And the fat mother-in-law, and the fat mother-in-law, they show ten comics touching on the same theme.  Why don't you call the black audiences enjoying the same tired rehash shit stupid?  Why is that not stupid?  The garbage they laugh at.  The same garbage a lot.  Why are they not stupid?  Why are you not attacking their intelligence?  Because you're afraid.  We can't understand, man.  How could I call it stupid if I can't understand the culture, man?  All right, wait.  We got Fernando from New York.  He's a liberal.  Fernando.  Fernando.  Oh, what's up, fellas?  Hi, Fernando.  Hey, Fernando. 
[01:10:30]  Listen, I'm on the liberal.  I'm on the...  I'm actually a liberal, but I just cannot stand the hypocrisy on that side either.  Um, because I'm actually a thinking liberal.  Um, and I thought the whole point of comedy was to talk about subjects that people don't  normally talk about, and to talk about it in a way that people can make, they can laugh  and smile and just have a good time.  So, to criticize another comic for doing their thing I think is totally hypocritical.  Well, even if they don't like the guy, to shit on him and say, I think he stinks, I got 
[01:11:00]  no problem with.  My problem is that they try to make him the rallying crab like he's this bad guy, because  when other comedians are judging the content of a comedian, he's homopho- I want to spit  in their faces.  It's like, you fucking phony.  I agree with you.  You phony.  All right.  Let's go to Scott in Cleveland.  Thanks, man.  Scott.  How you doing, boys?  Yeah, make it fast, because we're going to try to get on to the rosy thing here.  Real quick, no problem.  I just saw Paul Mooney last weekend.  Don't ask me why, but I was about the only white guy in the room. 
[01:11:30]  How about?  And we had to leave literally after about 25 minutes.  He's not my type, but why not go after somebody like that who completely hates white people?  That is about white hatred, his act.  It is totally about hatred of the white man.  Oh, and it's so much more fun when you're sitting in there with 50 black guys behind you  going, yeah, yeah, fuck whitey, fuck whitey.  Yeah, exactly.  Meanwhile, if you were a white comic, and first of all, I like Mooney.  I think he's a great fucking comedy writer.  I think he's funny.  He makes me laugh.  His lines are great.  He justifies what he says because he's funny. 
[01:12:00]  At least he's fucking doing jokes.  I think a lot of what he says is dumb, but he's funny.  I'm too uncomfortable to find him funny.  You know, I just watch him-  But I'm not going to get out there and, you know, this guy is an idiot, man.  He's got an audience, that's for sure.  And they seem to enjoy him.  So, I would find it too threatening to sit in that crowd and watch him perform like  that.  But you wouldn't see a guy-  Why is he not being attacked for being racist?  Why are they-  I mean, Larry, the cable guy? 
[01:12:30]  Come on, man.  You want to go after a guy who's going, no, that's for real.  That's for real.  Mooney will stop and go, no, that's for real.  That's the way it is.  He means it.  He means it.  He's not doing a character.  He means it.  And none of you guys are addressing that.  He hates whitey.  Yeah.  Address that.  Yeah.  All right.  You geese.  Well, maybe this guy could, I don't know, call a show and we'll get into it a little  He's not serious.  He won't.  He's got a Steven Hostetter.  I mean, he's just one.  I'd love to get an alternative comic to ask about what this is about.  All right.  Oh, Billy Crystal put a new book out. 
[01:13:00]  Grandpa's little one.  Ew.  That's cock.  He was also taking batting practice outside David Letterman's studio yesterday.  There is somebody with Johnny Damon because it's opening day for the Yankees.  There's somebody who just turned into some other guy.  Some complete different entity.  He was funny for 10 minutes back years ago.  I do recall him being funny for some time. 
[01:13:30]  And then he just turned into a goof of what he, uh, something he would goof on.  Got like old and pompous.  Didn't he refuse you for an autograph?  A photo.  And he was, and he knew I was a comic and he was a real douche to me.  Yes.  I've never had another comic be a douche to me.  Ellen was kind of cunty when I met her very briefly, but she had people surrounding her.  So I was like, all right, I guess she was busy.  He wasn't.  He was just being a dick.  All right.  Let's go to Nate in Brooklyn. 
[01:14:00]  He wants to call us out on something.  Hey, then, Nate.  Okay.  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  First of all, let me preface this by saying, Norton and everybody, I agree with you guys  100% on the whole hypocrisy of it.  But you guys, I have to call you out on this.  When Aries Spears went off on those guys in Florida, you guys could not have coddled and  pandered to him anymore.  Holy crap.  You were used to not.  Nate, don't even get me started.  He was treated like shit on that fucking show.  And they trashed him.  Dude, they trashed him.  They trashed him when he left, which was the problem we had with it. 
[01:14:30]  Is they didn't trash him when he was in there.  They trashed him when he left.  Right.  But then he turned it around and brought out the whole black angle, and you guys did not  call him out on it.  Did he bring the black angle out?  One second.  You did.  You did when you were listening to the tape, and when he was in the studio, you did not  call him out on it.  Hey, I wasn't here when he was in the studio.  Wait, what do you want us to call him out on?  But when he had a legitimate gripe that they were treating him like crap, that they were  pussies, that they waited until he left until they trashed him.  Fine.  Right.  Then he came back into the studio.  All of a sudden, it became, you don't talk about black people this way.  You shouldn't.  You're going to get your ass kicked if you talk about it. 
[01:15:00]  You know, it was all nonsense.  What is he turning it into?  A whole black, white thing.  And you guys were, you guys called him on it when you were listening to the tape.  But when he was in the studio, you did not even mention it.  Nate, I don't remember that thing.  No, I really don't remember it that way.  I remember him saying, I'm from New York.  I remember him saying he was from the streets of New York.  If we have the tape, let's hear it.  I don't remember.  Yeah, listen to the tape.  The whole thing.  I don't recall.  Yes.  Which was totally inappropriate because it undermined his whole argument, which was legitimate  because they were a bunch of douchebags who waited until he left.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Well, then he got heated and said some stuff. 
[01:15:30]  But, I mean, we went after the DJs for being complete wimps.  Yeah, they were wimps, but that's the whole point.  Completely.  He turned it into a whole black, white thing.  Why was he allowed to get away with that?  I don't remember it that way.  Dude, I honestly don't either.  And I wasn't even in the studio when he came in.  I don't remember that.  Did he say some black things and say that, you know, I'm from the streets and this and  that?  I remember some of that, but I don't remember him completely turning it into a black and  white thing.  Listen to it because he said, I remember him saying, when you make fun of black people,  you're going to get your ass kicked.  Listen to the tape.  You'll hear it again. 
[01:16:00]  Well, that is true.  But yeah, dude, look, and maybe he did say that, but from when I heard it on the tape and  I remember hearing it, I remember not getting, like, thinking, why is it a black thing?  And this is when it was on tape.  It was more like when you're reacting like that because you're pissed off and you're  saying something stupid, that's one thing.  I don't think he was turning it into a, uh, I'm black and that's why you attacked me.  You're justifying it.  No, I'm not.  Dude, dude, I wasn't, bro, I wasn't in studio when he came in.  No, that's true, but the-  So why would I justify it?  Oh, and A, you guys were in the studio and you guys were rightly calling him out on it 
[01:16:30]  when you listened to the tape in the first place.  Sir, sir, I'm afraid of black people.  I didn't, I didn't really-  At least you're honest.  Nate, I didn't call out Ari Spears on the tape.  I was calling out these jocks for being complete wimps.  That was my whole focus on that tape.  You're bashing Janine Garofalo and all the other liberal comics, and rightly so, for  being hypocrites, for only taking, for only going after the easy white targets.  You should go, you're saying, why don't they go after Chappelle?  Well, why didn't you go after-  Not Chappelle, but, you know, in general. 
[01:17:00]  And, you know, decide for yourself.  Dude, I hated what those jocks did to him.  So I was just-  Right, but-  Hold on, hold on.  I was just focused on that point of what was going on.  Right, but it had nothing to do with race, and the issue, the minute he brought up the  fact that I'm black, you're white, you have no right to do this to me because I'm black  and I'm going to beat you up.  I got to hear that.  I would like to hear that.  I got to hear that.  And all of a sudden, I have to jump on whitey's side at that point?  And the difference-  Then at that point, it was really heated.  I just thought when the guys start calling their security and stuff because they were scared  they might get punched, and then when they realized security was in place, and then 
[01:17:30]  they started, you know, trashing Ares and then waited for him to leave to really trash him.  I'm like, that's pretty fucking wimpy.  You had the chance to his face to say the same shit.  You're infantilizing his whole, the whole ridiculousness of his argument, the whole  idea that he turned this into a black-white thing.  If he wanted to just go after them for-  Someone has reminded me that they told Spears to go to, you know, go back to a black station.  Oh, right, yeah, okay.  I do remember that.  I do remember that, so.  Well, Nate said he's calling somebody out. 
[01:18:00]  I would like to hear the tape.  I remember it, but I don't remember that part of it, but we'll listen to it, man.  We fucking, I mean, look, there's a difference between being, and when I'm saying a coward,  if my friends Opie and Anthony didn't want to get punched in the face because a larger  man was in the studio, that's different.  I, you know, Nate.  I don't know, guys, you know, I respect you.  My actions, my actions.  You guys every day, but you're, you're really-  Nah, Nate, no.  Hey, hey, hey, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, Nate.  I'm not going to sit here and have you make a fucking victory speech.  Yeah, no.  You asshole. 
[01:18:30]  We got to listen to the fucking tape.  I'm not just going to take your word for it.  Nate, I don't say it that way.  Fucking guy, all of a sudden, he's making a fucking victory speech.  Yeah, and my actions speak for themselves.  I'm not scared of people when they come in here.  I wasn't scared of Aries Spears.  I was on his side for whatever reason.  I mean, this is a while ago now.  I was on his side because two dopes down in Florida treat him like shit.  And they were the same guys that went after Dan Natterman after he left the studio.  When he was in the car, they trashed him.  So that was their MO.  I don't disagree with any of that, and I agree with you guys that all the Comedy Central 
[01:19:00]  and all these mainstream comics are total hypocrites because they'll only go after the  soft, easy target, which usually means white.  I'm just saying, just listen to the tape again and decide for yourself.  All right, Nate, thanks.  Fair enough.  Take care, guys.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  Where's the tape?  I'm fine with Nate until he...  Because that's how people get their point across when it's not true.  He goes, see, well, no.  And he's ready to hang up, and he goes, just want to let you guys know, you know, I called  you out on this.  Hey, no victory speech. 
[01:19:30]  I want to hear the fucking tape.  Bastard.  Bastard.  Took that opportunity to bounce Arabs from the room anyway.  All right.  Not allowed.  People saying Nate is totally wrong.  Another guy was backing up Nate.  Spears use race as intimidation.  Did he?  Okay.  At that point, it was just a heated argument.  Well, it doesn't matter to me either way because I wasn't here, so believe me, if you  two were acting like a couple of Moes, I'll be more than happy to point it out. 
[01:20:00]  Jimmy wins.  I'm just saying that to piss me off.  No matter what.  I'm just going to acknowledge that.  Bastard.  I have rarely been wimpy in this studio.  Rarely.  No, I was just kidding.  You know, I was actually just sticking up for the dude because he just got a bad deal down  there in Florida when we got that tape.  Do we have time to do all aboard?  All aboard.  Rosie O'Donnell's gay cruise.  Why?  Why a gay cruise? 
[01:20:30]  I don't know.  Do you want to look at a bunch of guys holding hands?  Let them have their own cruise.  All right.  I agree now wholeheartedly.  There's nothing wrong with a gay cruise.  Yeah.  As long as you know that you may be going on a gay cruise.  This wasn't just on some boat that other people are going to be on.  Supposedly, Rosie O'Donnell took it upon herself to rent out an entire cruise ship.  How much money does that bring?  I have no idea.  She's got to be worth a million dollars.  I'm sure she didn't rent it out herself.  What a nut, Jim.  But she got together with one of these cruise companies and said,  Look, I want a boat for a gay cruise. 
[01:21:00]  I think I can fill up the whole damn thing.  And she did.  She certainly did.  Yeah.  It would be a different story if you're just going on thinking you're...  Thinking you're going on a cruise and it's the Rosie O'Donnell gay cruise.  I wish my travel dude freaking told me ahead of time.  My agent seems to have made a mistake.  I'm here on my cruise ship and...  Oof.  Some of the spiky haircuts and girls and flanels.  It's a little different here.  There was...  Her theme with this thing was family. 
[01:21:30]  It wasn't just gay cruise.  It wasn't called a gay cruise.  Right, right.  It was all about family.  And I've never seen so many black, Asian, Mexican mixed children with these gay couples.  Well, that's why I think we're playing the audio because...  Oh, man.  This is why I'm playing the audio.  You guys may have your own reason why we're playing this audio because I had no idea half  this shit was going on.  Wow.  So it was kind of an education.  I don't know if it was a good education, but it was an education. 
[01:22:00]  You know, a lot of people have an image of gay people as being single and they go out,  have their gay sex, go home, and cry in the pillow about how they've disappointed their  parents.  But it seems that there's a lot of these couples and they want children.  They want to raise families.  And this boat was loaded with guy-guy, girl-girl couples that are planning to have kids, have  kids, planning to have more kids, using the gay guy's sperm to impregnate the lesbians 
[01:22:30]  and make babies to give to this couple.  Can I back up?  You know how my stupid OCD shit works.  Chris in Connecticut.  Hey, Opa, you're talking about not being a wuss on the air, but I got three words for  you.  Sarah Jessica Parker.  Well, first of all, go back a little bit.  I said rarely.  I didn't say I was perfect.  There have been times that, yes, I should have said something and I didn't.  Did you ever listen to that Sarah Jessica Parker tape? 
[01:23:00]  And I don't think...  It wasn't.  It was funny.  It was very funny.  And there was bashing going back and forth.  We destroyed her.  And then she called in and called us out on it.  And then we definitely folded like a cheap tent.  Oh, boy.  $3 camera.  Right, exactly.  But then, you know, we went another direction with the whole thing and made good radio out  of it.  On a daily basis, we try to make good radio.  We destroyed her.  We said that she looked like Ruth Buzzi in a dress.  We said that she has a horse face. 
[01:23:30]  And she heard all this while she was on the set of Sex and the City because some of the  crew loved the show that we were doing locally here in New York.  And then she called us out on it.  And we had no idea.  First of all, we went to the phone to continue the bashing thinking some girl was going to  imitate Sarah Jessica Parker.  Right.  We had no idea it was actually her until like a little ways into the call went, oh, my God,  it really is her.  And then it was just awkward.  And then we decided to go another direction with the whole thing.  That's all.  Dude, sometimes it's just embarrassing when you get caught badmouthing someone like that. 
[01:24:00]  No one's afraid of Sarah Jessica Parker.  How can you be afraid of her?  I hear she's like 5'2".  Yeah.  Beat the shit out of her.  Exactly.  Exactly.  But that was just good, fun radio.  Yeah.  And then she told us to come down to the set because she says, I bet you guys are not that  great to look at either or something like that.  Yeah.  And then we were going to send like male models down there with flowers.  Yeah.  Say they were Opie and Anthony.  But then they ended up blowing us off.  She says, yeah, she's like, you can come down anytime. 
[01:24:30]  Like, all right, we'll be there Friday.  Whatever it was.  And then we try to talk to her.  Our people talk to her people.  And then they just completely blew us off.  Yeah.  So there you have it.  And we probably actually would have went down personally.  So we weren't going to wimp out.  Go to OAVirus.com to hear that bit, I guess.  I don't know.  Can you search on that site?  I don't know.  All aboard.  So you were saying, Anthony?  Yes.  Did I interrupt you?  I'm sorry.  It's a whole family thing.  And they're giving each other sperm and eggs. 
[01:25:00]  Now, the lesbians will give a...  You're spoiling a lot of this stuff.  Am I?  God damn it.  Because I had no idea that was going on.  I didn't know all this was going on.  I didn't know they were trading eggs and trading sperm.  It's amazing.  Right there on the ship.  See, the lesbian couple, they have the eggs.  And the gay guys have the sperm.  Yeah.  Who knew that they were swapping?  They're swapping the stuff that disgust them.  The things that they don't want to get near with the actual gear.  They're swapping their flawed DNA back and forth. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Just kidding.  But those are the lucky ones.  Those are the lucky ones.  And then we learn about the adoption thing.  Because the adoption thing is huge.  There's a clip of the adoption seminar, I guess.  Yeah.  And then we got in there, yeah.  Well, because it was a gay cruise, family-oriented gay cruise.  But then there was like, yeah, like you said, seminars and stuff.  Seminars on adoption.  Where they can learn about having their own kids and learn how to adopt it.  Yeah.  Don't blow it then because you can play the clips. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, and then they have a gay comedian on the ship.  Of course they do.  Then you need your gay-themed entertainment.  Rosie gets up there and addresses the crowd.  And then the gay comic.  And I got to say, ship comics are amongst the funniest comics you're ever going to see.  They're just a little too edgy.  I don't care for a lot of that dangerous water they tread on.  Can we go backwards again?  We love ship comics because they are so completely bad that it turns around and it's great to watch. 
[01:26:30]  Is it great to watch somebody like one of the worst hacks ever?  It's all we want.  Me and Louie were talking about that one day.  It's all you want to listen to on XM or whatever or you don't want to listen to good comics.  You don't want to hear Carl in a prior.  You want to hear the worst guy doing a fucking mall bit.  And when you're sitting there and watching this, I was dumbfounded at how awful these ship comics are.  All right.  Gary in New Jersey.  Hey, Ope.  I was calling because when you pretended to break Bernie Gets' CD, I heard some fear in that room. 
[01:27:00]  Absolutely.  He shot four people, sir.  That's why I said listen to the tape.  I didn't say I was perfect.  I said there were times, yeah, I wish I said something.  But in general, I've said what I want and I stick up for myself.  But yes, when we smashed Bernie Gets' CD, it got a little crazy in here.  And then when he left the studio and ran for his briefcase and realized, oh, shit, I wasn't able to bring a gun in here today, we were all pretty scared.  I wasn't the only one. 
[01:27:30]  I'm like, why is he running out of the studio and digging through his briefcase or whatever he brought that day?  Big duffel bag or some shit.  And I had done it before.  What else could he have possibly been looking for at that point in time?  Another CD because the one he gave me I broke?  Or a gun.  Or a gun.  So you're right.  You're right.  I don't blame you.  I would have been scared, too.  But I just think it was funny.  All right.  Thanks, Gary.  When you're right, you're right.  All right.  So here's the first bit of audio from the All Aboard special that Rosalind did on the Gay Family Cruise. 
[01:28:00]  Times have changed.  Every cruise that was raked first rate.  Even though they were really great.  Had a clientele.  Had a clientele only straight talk today.  You can camp it up.  Don't be shy.  Because we welcome each gal and guy. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, you like that junky cragat.  When you're getting straight trends or buy.  Oh, we thought I knew how to quit you.  Look around.  What a ship.  We're beginning a fabulous trip. 
[01:29:00]  Fabulous.  Lots of cows.  Lots of cows.  Time to welcome you all to our family.  I've got balls across your noses.  Hey!  Hooray!  Hooray!  And a 24-hour buffet.  Play some craps.  What the heck?  Run some laps.  Walk the deck.  It's so romantic.  Swap the deck with your mouth.  That's a way they can't walk them.  Why? 
[01:29:30]  Now we all got to do my living day.  That's the family and it's still in time.  Back to the bar.  Gazada, Melinda.  Here's audio of a guy in the audience that wasn't paying attention.  Oh.  Just wanted to go on a cruise and relax. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  Just like, what?  Here he is after he went into the gym on the ship.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Oh, horrible.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  Yeah, well.  I just don't like any cruise ship song, regardless.  Oh, anything.  It could have been about sex with beautiful women.  It's still an awful song.  Whenever people are running around, I despise musicals. 
[01:30:30]  Ah, today, their hands are flailing.  La-dee-da.  Yeah.  All over the top.  A big production.  A bunch of people doing the same shit at the same time.  La-dee-da.  Things are swell.  Yeah.  Rocking the board, a guy and gal.  Yuck.  This is what they ought to say.  Here's our song.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Things are swell.  Things are great.  Get a cracker.  We'll all masturbate. 
[01:31:00]  Last one to come is the lucky devil.  This is the entertainment they should have had on the cruise ship right here.  I got it for everybody. 
[01:31:30]  Yahoo.  Yahoo.  Made it to the poop deck.  Oh!  Motherfucker!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Made it to the poop deck.  Alright, here we go.  Pre-teen girls talk about their gay parents.  We first had a dad and a mom, and then our mom told us, and then my parents had divorce. 
[01:32:00]  And my sister said, well, I'm never gonna like girls.  I'm always gonna like boys.  I think the hardest thing is constantly feeling like you have to defend your family, having  to explain your story, and having to be like the perfect model family to show people that  you turn out alright.  So, it's sort of a lot of pressure against the times.  I was allowed to do like two Mother's Day projects, and I couldn't do a family treat  because my family wasn't considered a family.  Aww.  By the way, the hottest part of the whole special right there. 
[01:32:30]  Two girls.  About, uh, what were they?  Sixteen?  Am I bumping that up?  Family.  Oh, they weren't pre-teen.  Says pre-teen.  They were in little bikinis in the hot tub.  The family tree is a bush.  With no fertilizer.  Bush.  Almost.  Well, I don't know where fertilizer came into that. 
[01:33:00]  Can't fertilize the egg?  Can't fertilize, you know.  Okay.  A little stretch, I guess.  I was trying.  Stop looking at the button.  Alright.  In front of you guys.  Hold on, let me think.  Alright.  Gay man breaks down talking about how pastor said having a kid was okay.  Yeah.  Oh!  I'll never forget when we told our pastor what we wanted to do in terms of having a  baby.  Pastor.  And... 
[01:33:30]  Pastor went right to the guy.  Ha ha ha.  Thank you.  Why do you need the pastor's approval though?  I don't get that.  Uh, they like to be religious.  They like having some type of religion like they're accepted by God when everyone knows.  Church has been pretty bad to gay people.  Yeah.  I don't understand why.  Unless it's like a newer...  Yeah.  Why is that so important to you?  Dude, I'm sure it's some kind of newer...  It's the church of the cock.  You know, so.  What kind of pastor is giving his blessing on, you know, two guys getting married and 
[01:34:00]  having a...  Adopting a child?  And he just said that...  He said, um...  He said...  When we told our pastor that we were gonna have a baby, that we wanted to have a baby,  he said that that was wonderful and that that would bring more love into the world. 
[01:34:30]  And I just thought, wow, you know, I honestly believe that God was saying, you can have this baby.  There he was.  There he was.  You can act like a man!  What's the matter with you?  God was saying you could have this baby. 
[01:35:00]  People's, you know, people are stupid.  Gay, straight, we're all a bunch of adults.  I love when everyone tries to interpret what God is thinking.  Because one side is saying, God, you're the worst friggin' thing walking the earth in God's eyes.  And then he's saying, God's saying we could have this baby.  We just don't know.  God ain't saying anything else.  If there is one, there ain't one.  If he's saying stuff, if he's not, if he loves you, he hates you, you want a little dick? 
[01:35:30]  Is God going to hate you for it?  God ain't saying anything.  God stopped talking a long time ago.  He's just now watching.  Here's what God says.  You think God's like a has-been, a one-hit wonder?  He's just watching now.  He's busy.  He's watching.  What's he busy with?  God's like, what?  You're from where?  Isn't that in the Milky Way?  He's busy.  There's a bunch of other things to consider.  Like a bunch of other planets and projects.  Of course.  We're like an old hat.  God is just looking down at us and kind of acting like Robert De Niro, I think. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, don't do that.  Hey, what are you doing?  No, I wouldn't do that.  A little bit.  Right.  Tease him a little bit.  He's just watching and commenting at this point.  It's a big joke to him.  A big game.  That's why God shouldn't even be brought into the whole thing.  He hears every, does he?  Does he hear every prayer?  And he listens to every, oh, shut up.  He's laughing.  How do he do that?  He's laughing and saying, oh, now they think the hybrid cars are going to do something.  I think they're helping the planet until they see what I got planned. 
[01:36:30]  I'm going to fling a meteor into them.  End it all.  They're very happy that they're adopting children.  And it was kind of creepy.  Not kind of.  It was the creepiest thing I ever saw.  Two gay guys with this obviously adopted young son changing it on the deck somewhere.  And, you know, I'm open-minded.  I'm not going to say, oh, there ought to be laws to stop.  I don't care what you do. 
[01:37:00]  And believe me, I care not of children anyway.  But it was just to watch it, these two, like, really over-the-top gay guys changing a little baby.  It was just kind of creepy.  I like that, though, just because it's like there's so many kids need to be adopted.  It's like, go ahead, take them.  Well, that's what they're doing.  Oh, wait till you hear.  That's what they're doing.  Wait till you hear who gets adopted.  They ain't picking up the Prussian blue children.  Right.  They ain't picking up the little blonde-haired.  We're just saving that for a little later in this conversation, man. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  There are a lot of people that aren't as open-minded to that as you think.  Well, put it this way.  It's a lot easier to go to the bargain bin when it comes to adoption.  They're going to the dollar store.  Definitely.  Well, it might be by choice, or this is just a line of guys waiting for the Filipinos to come in.  Well, that could be, too.  But I think it's more like if you go to Marshalls and go to get that pair of pants where one leg's a little longer, because it's cheaper and easier to find. 
[01:38:00]  There you go.  Let's move on here.  Rosie's homo hairstylist.  This is what's written for me here, by the way.  I think that's how he was billed on the credits.  Rosie's homo hairstylist was overwhelmed.  It's so overwhelming to see all the children with gay parents.  Yeah, it was.  I've never seen so many.  As soon as we walked in, I just had this huge chill.  I started in, too, on the doc.  I just, tears came to my eyes.  It's all about love, you know? 
[01:38:30]  It's like the buffet for them.  Just children on a deck-long table.  Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like you to join us on the promenade deck tonight.  We're going to have a buffet that's going to feature children from 3 to 12.  And the chocolate bar will be open after that.  Don't forget to pick up a Bikini Teenie.  Right.  Just a teen.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, Bikini Teenie.  Bikini Teenie.  Hey, I know what you're getting at. 
[01:39:00]  Bikini Teenies are even too gay for this cruise.  All right.  I'll be you taking it.  And just in case you're wondering, we are in international waters.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, no laws apply now.  The laws of piracy.  So any screaming child running down the deck, if you could catch him,  he's yours.  That's right.  Can we sing?  All aboard.  Toot, toot.  Here in international waters, you take the age and multiply it by the longitude.  That's technically the sexual consent of...  Age times depth of water times miles away from the shore. 
[01:39:30]  Those are the rules we're living by right now.  And if you could just take the dicks out of your mouth for two seconds while they make  the rest of this announcement.  You think the boat just quietly...  I'm trying to remember this freaking reference and I don't have it.  You think the boat is just pulling out slowly and everything is quiet?  Maybe the scene just before in the Titanic, before it hit the iceberg, where everyone 
[01:40:00]  is very like, right, very quiet, wondering what the hell's going to happen.  And then it hits international waters and then all hell breaks loose.  The music starts off.  Festival!  There you go.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, we are in international waters.  Woo!  Are you feeling hot, hot, hot?  Yes!  Yeah! 
[01:40:30]  Full speed ahead!  Feeling teens, teens, teens?  My broth is hot, hot, hot.  All right.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Moving on here  Little conga line, they're all attached  It's like Legos  Moving on, here's Rosie speaking before the crowd 
[01:41:00]  About two and a half years ago  Kelly, myself, and Greg were sitting having dinner  Hopi  And I said, wouldn't it be great if we could do some sort of vacation package  And Greg said, well, why don't we rent a cruise ship?  And I was like, sure, why not?  How hard could it be?  It's been really, really interesting  Because, you know, in every relationship  Kelly's theory is there's a flower and there's a gardener 
[01:41:30]  I am the flower  She gardens  So things like  For the last two or three  Is that a top reference bottom?  I don't know  I'm going to garden  I mean, we've all seen Rosie and her partner  Would you ever think Rosie was the flower?  Maybe she just trims her bush  That would be like  The duty of a gardener  A good gardener  Oh  Wow  What happened? 
[01:42:00]  Her partner's very attractive  Whatever her name is  It was like  For the last two or three months  I'm like  Honey, I cut my leg  To wear the band-aid  She's like  I am on the phone  They are booking a double penthouse  Can you just wait?  Everything was about the damn cruise  I started to get a little jealous  A little pissed off  She's like  Do you think lesbians like peanuts?  How do I know?  I got to tell you 
[01:42:30]  Honestly, as we were checking in  It was very moving  It was very overwhelmed  I got all choked up  But seeing all the beautiful families  Built of love  Coming in to check on  And party together  And  A lot of people said  The Norwegian Dawn  That's the biggest cruise ship on the sea  Are you out of your mind?  And I said  No, I believe  And all of you  You believe too  So thank you very much  I hope you have a great time  And we'll see you this week  All right 
[01:43:00]  Well, that sounds like fun  Sounds like a blast for everybody  It's like a great time  Right?  Where's Hawk?  Huh?  What's wrong?  What the hell's going on?  What's wrong?  I'm just waiting for Hawk  To get back in the studio  Why?  Something is going on  What is going on?  Why does it take so long?  Eric?  Yeah  What's he doing?  Well, I was just wondering  If there's 
[01:43:30]  All right  Let me see  All right  The sound's off out there  Why?  What's up?  Is that guy gay?  Who?  Our guest  Twitchels?  The bio that  No, I just gave you the bio  For the guy that's sitting out there  I don't think so  Did you read his bio?  Yeah, but he just blacked his bag  I don't think so  Masturbated in gay porn films  At start of career  His adult films include  Hot Sessions No. 3  Young, Hard, and Solo 
[01:44:00]  No. 2 and No. 3  His porn's name was Sebastian  Became an MTV VJ  His porn past cost him his job  Why?  Why would fucking MTV care?  It's Simon Rex  Simon Rex from Scary Movie 4  Is coming in?  Scary Movie 4  And he's sitting out there  And I didn't know if he's gay  And again  I don't care  I'm still going to make fun  Of the rosy gay crews  But then I just want to know  What we're going to be  Walking into later 
[01:44:30]  Or backing into  I'm guessing  I'm actually guessing  No  I'm guessing that he just  Probably whacked his bag  For some porn  Dude  Stop it  Someone films you  Just whacking you off  And wants to give you money  Why not?  In Young, Hard, and Solo  If you're going to be jerking  You know it's going to be  A gay film  That it's going to be  Gay men  If they wanted to pay me  To whack my bag  And just videotape it  And look  With my awful body  They're more than welcome to  Hand me the cash  I don't care who enjoys it  Well we'll find out  In a little while I guess

[01:51:30]  Look  I  I don't know what that's like  But I gotta say  It beats being in a foster home  You  You  You  You can't  Like when gay couples  When we adopt  Let them take their kids  They're in foster home  We're paying for it  Let  People wanna have kids  Let them adopt kids  Yeah but  Man I don't know  I was adopted  Like I'm saying  And it would be  I mean things have happened  In my life  That kinda suck now  Cause my dad was probably  Very strict on me  But  I don't know  Just think about  How  You wouldn't have a choice 
[01:52:00]  Of whether or not  What people thought of you  As a child  You don't anyway though  If your dad's an alcoholic  Or if your mom's a fucking  The neighborhood whore  Or your father beats you  You don't have a choice anyway  That's not as bad though  Well I mean it depends  On what he beats you with  If he's fucking putting  Mushroom drinks on your face  Well  I know  I'm just saying  I would be pretty pissed off  I just see a lot of  Craziness in the world  And  Being the son of a preacher man  A lot of the stuff  You're saying  You know  It's kinda weird  To hear all that  What's going on 
[01:52:30]  And  All the fucking  Just shit  That is going on  In the world  All right  Thanks  That was my fault  All right  Thanks  Let's go to Tim in Jersey  Tim what's up  Hey what's up guys  Hey  What's up  They're on a cruise  It's all women  Don't they understand  They need cock  If they want to get pregnant  It's not all women  No  They're gay guys  And this  They're gay guys  Well maybe they should  Mix it up a little  They do  They do  I don't have a clip  Of that unfortunately  But  We learned

[01:53:30]  So then  Here's some audio  On the adoption process  Or they're educating  The ship goers  About adoption  Right  Your first problem  Is getting a birth mother  That will surrender  To a same sex couple  Your second problem  Adoption today  Is very expensive  Your average foreign adoption  Will run you  Between twenty five  And thirty thousand dollars  If you're willing  To accept a child  Where the birth mother  Has a drug history  Or if you want  An african-american child 
[01:54:00]  That will increase  Your chances  Increase your chances  Isn't that amazing  You could get a little  Broken black baby  For next to nothing  If you're a  A gay  Gay guy  It's just like  Unbelievable  Oh man  And uh  Those guys are facts  What is all the  Whispering going on  Yeah what are you  Whispering for  Who is your daddy  And what does he do  Martini Steve

[02:00:30]  You know that  No way  What does it say  Can I read that at least  Yeah what does it say  Alright well first of all  It's what a weird intro  But Simon Rex  You're going to be in  You are in Scary Movie 4  That opens on Friday  Yeah  And we remember you from MTV  And all that stuff  Yeah yeah yeah  Alright  Well it says on page 6  To the New York Post today  B-List Party Boy  That's funny  I like that  You like that  It's better than C-List  B-List isn't bad  I'll take it  I would like B  Yeah  Yeah please  I've heard that one before 
[02:01:00]  That's funny  Like Z-List  I don't think we're even  In the C category  No  B-List Party Boy  Simon Rex  Was literally caught  With his pants down  At a Chelsea nightclub  Called Sturio  Over the weekend  That's funny  I don't know  If that's necessarily true  Pants down  You mean like what  With a chick or something  Well it says  Literally caught  With his pants down  So they're saying  You were caught  With your pants down  Literally means  That's news to me  But that's  You know  You can't always believe  You know that stuff  You can't believe page 6 
[02:01:30]  I mean maybe when I was  Maybe when I was in the bathroom  Taking a leak  My pants were half down  You know they could say that then  And be accurate  Technically they were right  You know he was standing  In this club  With his dick out  In the fucking bathroom  So it says  You were caught  With your pants down  At the Chelsea nightclub  Stereo over the weekend  The Soused  Were you Soused?  The Soused?  What is that?  Soused  S-O-U-S-E-D  Loaded  Oh yeah I was probably  Had a couple beers  But not enough to wear my  You know  So that part's true  Right?  Yeah  All right  So the South Scary Movie Actor 
[02:02:00]  Asked us to use his cell phone  In a private hallway  Yeah  Wait wait  The South Scary Movie Actor  Asked  Oh asked to use  His cell phone  In a private hallway  So you wanted to call someone  In a private hallway  Yeah yeah  I mean  It's all coming together now  I'm just  With my pants off  At this point  Where were you keeping  Your cell phone?  Yeah exactly  So you needed to make a call  And you asked if he could  Use it in a private hallway  Which is weird  But when owners Michael and Barry  Checked on him 10 minutes later  They found Rex with his pants down 
[02:02:30]  That's amazing  All right  So we get more  I got to save this  Is it today's?  Yeah  So we get more details  About the whole  Literally being caught  With your pants down  Maybe I should have read this  Ahead of time by the way  I don't know what  It's going to say next  So the owners  All right  So you  All right  What is happening  They let you get in the hallway  The owners  Make a private cell phone call  They come back 10 minutes later  You're there  With your pants down  That's amazing  They found Rex with his pants down  And about to empty his bladder  On the floor 
[02:03:00]  Oh come on  All right  So now we know  Why the pants were down  You had to take a leak  Yeah  I mean  That's pretty funny to me  I think I'd remember that one  But  That's so funny  I mean  I don't know how that gets fabricated  That's crazy  They immediately bounced him  Out of the club  Do you remember being bounced?  That didn't happen man  Nothing like that happened at all  Who wrote this  That they  Did they see it first hand?  Are they hearing from the owners?  Who else was in the private hallway?  Is it one of their spies? 
[02:03:30]  Like how do they get this info?  Well page six isn't exactly reputable right now  No right now  They're trying to blackmail a billionaire  For fucking 100 grand  So  Right  Even if you did do it  Who gives it?  You could just shit in the hallway  No one will believe what they say anyway  That's pretty funny  I'm going to have to save that one man  That's great  That's a good one for the scrapbook  That's great  And it says  Well then it says  Exposing himself is nothing new for Rex  Before he became semi famous as an MTV VJ in the 90s  The former Paris Hilton play thing  Yeah  That part's true 
[02:04:00]  We played around a little  You got Paris?  Yeah well I've known her for a long time  We just did a movie together  You know  This National Lampoon movie called Pledge This  That's coming out  She picked me to play her boyfriend  Because I've known Paris forever  Known or like  Yeah I know  Yeah  You got some action?  Yeah  That's pretty cool  Nowadays is that really saying anything?  No it's kind of a cool fraternity to be in  Yeah that's cool  That's cool  And I love that he admits that  Nice one to have on the list  Yeah yeah yeah  Yeah no she's actually  I've known her forever  She's a friend of mine  I don't want to just say 
[02:04:30]  But you know whatever  Yeah we fucked up  Does she play dumb?  She does  She's actually a lot smarter than people think  She fools a lot of people  And she's a smart girl  And she knows what she's doing  She got big feet  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Like freakishly big  Kind of hang over the shoes  Like talons  Why would you ask that?  Because she's known to have big feet?  Yeah she's kind of known to have big feet  Do you have a foot fetish?  No  Foot guys love that  They're nice feet  Big like size of lemons  No no I don't like big feet  I like like cute feet 
[02:05:00]  But it doesn't drive me nuts  You know I'm not like  Alright you gotta have  Yeah I mean  I wasn't going to kick her out of the room for it  Like little footprints in sandboxes  In the pool yard  Yeah I never care what feet look like  They look like mad magazine feet  All fucking bent in half  Crooked two left ones  I'll still fuck her  So I guess we'll admit that you were drunk or soused  Yeah  I've never heard that word soused  I like soused  Yeah  No it's definitely soused  Yeah  You were using a cell phone in a private hallway 
[02:05:30]  They checked on you ten minutes later  And you were pretty much  They're not fessing up to the pissing on the floor  You pretty much had your pants down  That's great  Because you wanted to take a leak  That's great  You know I wish it was true  I mean that would make me pretty much a rock star  But you know  Yeah when you're pissing on the floor  That's pretty awesome  In the middle of a club  Yeah  Dude you should just  Were they saying I was urinating  Or was it just that they were  They found Rex with his pants down  And about  About  Oh god  And that's when they bounced you from the club  That didn't happen at all  And then they give you a nice plug here  That you hung with Paris Hilton 
[02:06:00]  Yeah  And then they mentioned the gay porn video  Yeah  Not gay  It's misunderstood  It's  It was me by myself  But they call it gay porn for some reason  That's what Jimmy was saying  That's why  I want to get into this a little bit  That's all  Let's move on  It's just  It's a guy  Just jacking  Alone  Right  And I'm sure  The clientele of the videos  Are gay guys  But it doesn't mean the guy  Few girls too  But mostly dudes  Doesn't mean the guy's in it  Unfortunately  But Jimmy said  That he would absolutely do the exact  The bio says this 
[02:06:30]  This is what told me  It's as masturbated as gay porn films  The star of the career  If you're whacking off  And someone wants to pay to film it  I mean what the  I don't care  Without watching it  I do it every day anyway  So I figured  You know  Might as well get paid for it  Exactly  I've done it for free on Pal Talk  If somebody wanted to give me cash  To watch me whack my dick  With my awful stomach  And appendix scar  I'd be fucking more than happy  To take the cash  I don't care who watches it  Show my parents  Yeah  Pretty much  That's pretty much how I felt  At the time too  But then you know  Here I am 13 years later  And it's still like  The only thing people ever say about me  Haunts you  Yeah whatever  That's bullshit 
[02:07:00]  Yeah it's  You know  Here we are  You just need a few bucks  To pay the phone bill or something  Yeah I was living with this  I had this girl  And she had a kid  And I was fucking  The kid was calling me daddy  I was working as a fucking busboy  Shit  I had you know  I had to do something  And she did like  Hustler, High Society  Those magazines  You know  Other girls  And all that stuff  She's like  Hey we gotta pay the rent  Help out  I didn't know any better  Sure  But you know  So basically  That's how that happened  Why did MTV  This annoys you at MTV  They said it cost you  At the MTV gig  Which really annoys me  That's not true 
[02:07:30]  Oh okay  Because then the bio's wrong  Yeah  A lot of  It's so funny  It seems like everything's  Just fucking wrong  I mean that's  They fire MTV VJs regularly  And hire new ones  They let me go  When I worked there  I was with John Sencio  Idalis De Leon  Bill Bellamy  Kennedy  And they fired like  Five of us  At once  And I was part of that group  It had nothing to do with that  As a matter of fact  I thought I was gonna get fired  When all that surfaced  But they're like  Look  We hired Jenny McCarthy  For her laying on a car  And touching herself  What's the difference  I'm like cool  Alright 
[02:08:00]  Six months later  I get laid off  They said it was because of that  Not true again  So  Nothing's ever fucking true anymore  Man  I was about to get annoyed  At MTV  Yeah  Shows you how little I know  Yeah  The papers  Constantly get shit wrong  Anyway  Yeah  Now whenever I read shit  It's like I believe  They say believe half of what you see  And nothing of what you hear  That's sort of my philosophy now  Because pretty much everything  Comes across me  Seems like bullshit  But I don't know  And they don't want to do  Their own research  Yeah  I mean we've had our  Without getting completely into

[02:32:30]  Last night  For the first time in years  We're off  All right  All right virus  I just popped on the last night  Remind me of that  I'm like you know what Ben  I don't listen to the old audio  It's like  It's like looking at myself  With bad  With a bad haircut  In old pictures  I don't want to hear myself  In the old days  Some of them are hard to listen  Others are really fun  I like this  I like this new version of myself  Where I still have it in me  But I kind of keep it under control  For the most part  When you  Ben's like  Oh you gotta listen to it  No I don't  When you listen back 
[02:33:00]  I also have a picture somewhere  Of me with a fucking mullet  I don't break that out either  The venom  That was being spewed  To Steve Kingston  And it was well over an hour  It was over an hour  Will Penn Darvis  I mean just kill it  Oh my god I know  Remember that  We went after Will  And I don't even remember why  We were just looking  To sink our teeth  Into people's faces  Back then  I forget the reason  I forgot  Because he turned out  To be a good guy  He turned out 
[02:33:30]  To be an all right guy  He turned out  To be a really good guy  Will Penn Darvis  I think we were just  Making fun of his radio voice  Because then you'd see him  And he'd be like  Hey what's up guys  How you doing  Will had a great line  He's like  I think Steve Kingston  Had too much earwax  In the day he listened  To his air check  I said that  That's funny  Look I used to be funny  There's like some  OA virus put up  Like all the old  Like N.E.W. K. Rock wars  There's like a whole section  Of them  Nice  There's the Stone Temple  Pilots thing  There's a whole  Well there were plenty of them  Yes  That's for sure 
[02:34:00]  Jesus Christ  That's funny  Very cool  Let's do a little OCD talk  I love the OCD thing  It has affected my life personally  And I still can laugh about it  I can feel laugh  And laugh  And laugh  What's up with the OCD  What do we got  Hoarding  Hoarding  I've heard about these people  Sometimes it causes their deaths  As it should 
[02:34:30]  Hoarding  People that save everything  Yeah they save everything  Their apartments amount to  Junk  That has little tunnels  Through them  And chasms  In the junk  Some people just collect  Like one thing  Like newspapers  For some reason  And they're all stacked up  And there's a famous case  Like one of the first  Hoarding cases  Back in I think  The 30's  I can't remember who it was  But  The guy was crushed  I'm trying to remember myself  Anthony  The guy was crushed  By his junk 
[02:35:00]  And that kind of  Brought it to light  Who's crushed by his junk  Was it Ben  By his junk  Ben's bar  That was just Ben  Trying to roll over in bed  My junk  Help  Call 911  FDNY had to pull my junk off me  Sir if you keep joking about this  I'm going to send the police  My junk is crushing me dude  Ben's retard cock  Stupid messy hair dude  We don't know  Be fair  We don't know what it is down there  We think it's one big ball  It could be his balls  It could be his cock 
[02:35:30]  I bet you it is  I bet you Ben has  Testicular elephantitis  And his cock is three  I bet he's got a three by one cock  And elephantitis of the testicles  I hope so  I'd like to kick his fucking  Bean bag chair ball  And feel for myself  With my bare feet  Good toenail dig  Right into his thick vein  Straighten him right out  Just looks like one of those  Old school bombs  With the little fuse  Sticking out of it  A spy versus spy  Mad magazine bomb 
[02:36:00]  That's what I needed to do  To make that better  See I'm learning  That's in his pants  Just my fucking little  Too long fucking toenail  To dig right in the underside  Of that fucking ball vein  Drain it all  And straighten him right out  There you go  Comb your hair  On the way to the emergency room  Shithead  Garbage brothers  In Harlem  What?  Super golfer  From Wack Bag  Hey guys  Hey super golfer  Yeah there were these  Two brothers in Harlem  They were the Collier brothers  Collier brothers  Yes  Yes and they had 
[02:36:30]  You know they were  These hoarders  And they had filled  Their apartment  With years worth of  Like you can look it up  Online  Yeah what year was this?  It was in the 40s  It was the 40s?  That they had been hoarding  Since for like  30, 40, 50 years  Before then  Yeah and something  Toppled over and crushed them  What'd they hoard?  Oh it was newspapers  Bathtubs  Like half a car  They had towers of stuff  And they had booby traps  In there too  But why would you hoard papers? 
[02:37:00]  Like when are you gonna read them?  People  When?  Who's got the time?  Every day a paper comes out  A new one  Every day  What are you gonna go back  To like 75?  I gotta catch up?  It's a  Yeah psychological problem  People have with  Parting with certain things  So they hoard  And everyone has it to a point  But there are certain things  I'm sure everyone has  Around their house  That you go  I should throw this away  But you keep it  For some stupid reason  These people  It's that times a billion 
[02:37:30]  And they just cannot  Get rid of anything  I just keep throwing away  And throwing away these days  Yeah  Oh yeah  I go into my clothes  Still got your dresser?  Or did you throw it away?  Well yeah  I'm not really using it  You're not using it though?  No the clothes are  You still stack your clothes  On the floor?  You lunatic  The clothes are on top  Of the dresser  Why do you put them  In the drawers?  I sometimes do  I hope he doesn't  Want to be a big boy  You don't want to be  A grown up  You don't want to  Grow it up  Well it's funny you say that  Because I'm looking for  To buy a place in Manhattan

[02:42:00]  Used to be a paramedic  And we got a call  One time  And the police officers  Were standing outside  Of the house  And they said  She's in there  And we can't even  Get past the door  And we ended up  Calling the fire department  To bring us  Those air masks  So we could go in  And retrieve the lady  Literally from the floor  Almost to the ceiling  Was garbage everywhere  Newspapers  Magazines  Stuff that she collected  Cats all over the place  Crazy cat lady  It was so bad  I ended up 
[02:42:30]  Throwing away my uniform  Because it was so permeated  With the smell  Of everything in there  It was  There was just  Little aisleways  To walk around  Through the house  Were there any bugs?  Oh there were  There were  And there were fleas  From all the cats  It was  I would love to see  Pictures of this  It was disgusting  What happened to her?  Why was she sick?  I don't remember  What the exact cause  Of death was  Why she was sick  She was an older lady  And just finally passed away  Oh and by the way 
[02:43:00]  This was in the middle of July  So it was like  You know  90 degrees  And she had been in there  For a few days  And  That's wonderful  Everything she saved  Was just hauled out  By guys with gloves  And thrown away  Unceremoniously  Right  There's your life  In the dumpster  You old bag  Her whole life  You thought this  Was all important  Look at that dumpster  Over there  And this goes on  All the time  We used to see this  Constantly going into these  Especially the older people  They just get to the point  Where they hoard everything 
[02:43:30]  And you would  You would be amazed  At how many houses  You go into  And see this stuff  Strewn everywhere  And they're saving  Every little thing  A little piece of  A cloth  That they want to save  Because it meant  Something to them  Here's the thing  What you should do  When you hit a certain age  The government should come in  With chains  And hook up your feet  And just drag you out  To a place  Like you know  They tow a car  Every day  You should see a tow truck  Driving by  With like 11 old people  Dragging by the feet

[02:47:30]  Piled to the ceilings of her Connecticut home  Allowing only a narrow path  To get from room to jam packed room  I keep paper bags  Boxes  Clothing I haven't put away  Yogurt containers  A lot of office supplies  Linda is one of at least 2 million people in this country  With a condition known as compulsive hoarding  A powerful urge to acquire  A paralyzing inability to discard  When I go to throw something out  I get nauseous  A headache 
[02:48:00]  I break out in the sweat  She's a former lab technician  Whose condition has cost her jobs  Good  She first felt it  When she was just 7  Someone had thrown out a notebook  And I thought  Oh my god  I can use that  Just throw it away  Or light a match  And be done with it  This is what you do  When you find out someone's a hoarder  You give them a fucking gas can party  Right through the house  All those papers  A match  Either run out  Or die with your hoarded shit  You fucking waste of space  Do we have to name everything? 
[02:48:30]  Exactly  There is a term for it  It's called asshole  You're an asshole  Jimmy you're a bit  You're a bit on OCD  I don't want to do it  Because you know  I don't do it well  But you're a bit on OCD  About how you know  It used to be called  Just what was it  Don't do that  Or something  Stop doing that  You look like an asshole  Kind of like the line I just did  No no no no no  It was a little different  Give me your CD  A little different  Because now I'm going to play  That was a word  Because it really is brilliant  It makes the point  It's off the other one 
[02:49:00]  It's off the other one  Because we have to name  Every stupid freaking disease now  Here's the thing  There used to be a big category  For most of this stuff  Just stop  This lady  Is  Just a fucking idiot  And it's like  She's talking about it  And there's treasures  There's not treasures  There's treasures  No  Don't worry about my CD log  It's fine  I get embarrassed  Listening to myself  It's a great bit though  Thank you  It's fine  I get shy  You sort of said it anyway  I'm shy Opie 
[02:49:30]  God I had no idea  This was going on  Like the phones are lit  A lot of people  Have had experience  With the hordas  A lot of the cops  And the EMS  Ah  Oh Jesus  Oh poor guy  Never mind  No never mind  Don't even go there  I'm not CNN  Let's go to Jeremy  In Jersey  B-b-b-boys  Hi  Listen  My friend  Let's just call him  Timmy  His mom is  I'd say she's  Schizophrenic  And she's got  About 35 cats  And the ones 
[02:50:00]  That have died  She's kept  In her freezer  What is it about  Cats  That make people  Like crazy cat people  Well she's a crazy cat lady  Handy  Small animal  Yeah but everybody  Has known a crazy cat lady  I think everybody  Has had  Through their life  Somewhere at some point  Has known  Where the crazy cat lady  Lived  Well she's the one  In my town  There was someone  In our neighborhood  That their whole backyard  Was just cats  I mean  If I had to guess  Close to 100 cats  No problem  All mating 
[02:50:30]  And making more  Yeah they just  They just make more  It becomes insane  But you could pet the kittens  All right let's go to John  Hey John  Please  What's up boys  Well first of all  I'm a medic in the city  So I've met a lot before  It's very common unfortunately  But back in 1990  My grandfather passed away  Now in 1960  My grandmother passed away  My kids put them all up  Into foster care  Because he couldn't deal  With them anymore  And hadn't thrown anything out  Since 1960  Including all the contents 
[02:51:00]  Of a refrigerator  In the basement  We took the  You know the big dumpsters  You know  At the construction sites  I guess  Are they 60 yard dumpsters  Whatever like that  Six of them  To empty out the house  Well what was in the  Refrigerators from the 60's  They were  You know what  We opened it up  The smell  Made us almost pass out  We wound up  Closing it back up  Taping it up  And just throwing it  Into the dumpster  Was the food bad  You think  It was whatever  Was in there  He had cans of 
[02:51:30]  Fruit and vegetable  In his cabinets  He also was a printer  So he'd come home  And he worked at a  Newspaper  Printing place  He'd come home  And the problem was  We couldn't just  Toss everything out  Because he's the type of guy  Who would take his money  For the day  He started off with $20  Whatever he spent  He'd write on  This little envelope  And keep putting  The money in  So at the end of the day  He'd say  Okay I have $3.22  He'd put that envelope  On a table  But then put a stack  Of papers on top of it  He'd do that every day  We wound up taking out  I think we found  $10,000 in cash 
[02:52:00]  In the house  Just in these envelopes  He had a stamp collection  That had it been  In good condition  Would have been worth  They went from  $300,000 to $400,000  I think we got $10,000 for it  Wow  All of his mom's toys  From when she was a kid  Just stole the room  I mean he completely lost  I mean he was an asshole  Beyond that  But I mean  Was he your dad?  What's up?  Was he your grandfather  Or your father?  He was my grandfather  I mean he was just  He totally lost his mind  He had  Like I said  And there was just  Wall to wall 
[02:52:30]  Stacks of newspapers  And printing supplies  And just crap  All over the place  I'll bet you  There's a fucking  Like a Ty Cobb rookie card  Or a Honus Wagner rookie card  One of these hoarding  Idiots homes  That someone will throw out  Without knowing it  Right  Like I said  This stamp collection  $300,000 to $400,000  And he had nothing for it  Basically because  He didn't take care of anything  Alright thank you sir  Later boys  The stories are like  Crazy now  See my dad will save shit  A little bit  But my mother would 
[02:53:00]  Throw out her own  Wedding photos  She just doesn't  Get attached to shit  We didn't care  Yeah so it balances  Let's say how to Ryan  In Connecticut  You have to be though  Especially when you move  Just get rid of it  It's garbage  I'm a saver  Ryan  Yes  Hey  What's going on  Hey man  We love you  Hey uh  I've got this issue  Where I save every  Postal note that I write on  And I've had them  I've got them  Going back to like  1990  I've got boxes of them  I can't throw them out  Why  Why not 
[02:53:30]  What do they mean to you  Like as I go throughout  My daily routine  Anything that comes up  At any spot  Like if I see a girl  On the street  That I think is hot  I write her down  And I write down  You know  The characteristics  That I think are hot  Holy shit  This guy is crazy  Or if I see a new car  That I like  You know  I write that down  Here's the post  That you should write  Write I'm an ass  And put it on the refrigerator  You've got to write a book  With all your post-it notes in it  Do something with it  That's interesting  So you do that 
[02:54:00]  And then save them  Well see I  Yeah  And I  And I actually  A girlfriend of mine  One time  Wanted me to get rid of it  I mean  They take up  An entire clothes closet  I've got them just stacked  And you know  And in boxes  And I  I feel  I've actually tried  Throw them out  And it makes me  Nauseated at the thought of it  You know  Everything I write down  Is usually like a happy thought  You know  Sir your thoughts  Aren't that interesting  Like there's nothing unique  About the  Just let it go  You got your fucking head  They all come from your head  That's the beauty of it 
[02:54:30]  It's like a big computer  With all your dumb thoughts in it  What do you  What are you  Never gonna need them  You'll never go  Oh my god  Why did I do that  All you'll do  Is put more shit in the closet  And go  Oh this is cool  I got room now  Are they filed by years  Or anything  Um  The boxes  Like the actual boxes  That the stacks of them are in  They have you know  They have like rough days  I can almost  See it  If the guy can go  What was I thinking  July 12th  1990  That's called a diary

[02:57:30]  No kidding  That's right  Keep the cop  Hey good morning gentlemen  Hey Keith how are you  Yeah we used to have one of these  Wow we got us a fucking comedian  Oh  Yeah Keith  I can't wait for Opie to get a house  So I can give him a housewarming present  Housewarming gift  Asshole  I cannot  I cannot wait to see who saw that  On my lawn before I removed it  I'm sure all the neighbors  Had the same thoughts  Like wow I gotta get one of those too  Yeah sure they did  Yeah  But we used to have a guy  Lived in a brownstone 
[02:58:00]  And he was almost like a midget  I guess he was kind of like a dwarf  And uh  He had the papers piled so high  And the family used to show up  Every once in a while  Because they were trying to get him out  Because they wanted to get him to the brownstone  So I was trying to get this guy to like commit  But he had like tunnels and stuff like that  So on occasion  When we would go there  And we'd have to take him out of the place  He'd like scurry through the tunnels  Oh my god  It was like Vietnam  You're a tunnel rat  Trying to chase the VC through the tunnels  Yeah it was kind of similar to that  And like one time 
[02:58:30]  I saw him like he went to go shoot into a tunnel  So I like kind of dove  And I grabbed him by the leg  And it was like one of those like  Dog kicking kind of leg things you know  He's pulling a midget out of a tunnel  And uh yeah  But you know what  The strangest thing is like  The doctors just kept letting him back out  And they were  Yeah what are they gonna do  Commit him  Was he hurting anybody  Or just being an ass  No he just had tons of shit there  And the family wanted  You know  The brownstone was probably worth  You know two million dollars  And it was just two full stories 
[02:59:00]  Full of all this shit  With tunnels throughout all the rooms  And uh  They couldn't get him out  The doctors would just send him back  And he would just go back to living there  Yeah they could  There's so many people that are kooky  That they couldn't possibly lock them all up  So you get your kooky people like this guy  And they they hoard things  And what are you gonna do  Was he messy or was it neat  No no  It was a total mess  I mean but most of it  I would say 90% of it was newspapers  And it was just  People and newspapers  Piled and piled and piled  Until they made all these tunnels  Throughout these rooms and everything 
[02:59:30]  And you could barely get through it  That sounds cool if you're eight  Yeah  Doesn't it sound like fun  You make little tunnels  Out of newspapers  We used to make forts  In my parents living room and stuff  Yeah  That was fun  Yeah but as a kid though  You'd have the ambition  Until you stack up like two stacks  And then you'd get bored  There you go  And these guys actually have some gumption  Well maybe because his body never changed  From when he was eight  Yeah  It was probably 30 or 40 years worth  Of newspapers  Alright Keith  Alright  Bye sweetie  Later  Let's get back to Linda  Hoarding has ruined relationships 
[03:00:00]  Linda cries  Can you tell me a little bit more about  Yes  About the impact of hoarding on your social life  I recently was involved in a very serious relationship  We were engaged  And it was broken off partly because of the hoarding  So  That's terrific  That's terrific  Act like wherever you are  That's the place to be 
[03:00:30]  Hey  Aren't these tunnels great  Tunnels great  I gotta break it off with you  Oh baby  I guess you brought him home  Exactly  He was like what the hell  I'll be behind the papers in sector three  Alright you fucking wacko  Here take one more load and I'm leaving  She's all busted up about it  Linda has gotten one element of her hoarding under control  She no longer goes dumpster diving  Just driving down the street on trash day  It's like going past a million bars for an alcoholic 
[03:01:00]  Something's going on here  Oh definitely  A trip with Dr. Toland shows she still fights powerful urges  This is a definite keeper  This is killing me  Oh my god  You're reminding yourself that this is not a person  Right  That this is not  You're not rescuing somebody  Right  That it is a thing  But when they go to her home  Dr. Toland finds it is much harder for Linda to let go of the things she already has 
[03:01:30]  Holy cow  So we got mouse turds in here  Tell me what it is that you're thinking about this box  It's irreplaceable  It's irreplaceable  They don't make them that strong  A box  Holy shit  One between her legs  Everybody wants attention  Here's how you handle it  Everybody wants attention  It's wrong the way the doctor's doing it  Telling you what she's doing  When she goes  I would like to have that  You go  Oh would you?  How do you feel about that on your cheek? 
[03:02:00]  Fat face  Exactly  Is she fat?  I assume she is  Can someone tell me  Is she fat?  Did someone see it  When they pulled the clips  Because I'm assuming  She's fat  I don't need to see it  She's fat  She's fat  She's probably hoarding  Danny you saw it?  Yeah  She wasn't like deathly obese  But she was definitely  Definitely fat  She was a big  Bigger old lady  We're going to role play  You're going to be the girl  And I'm going to be doctor  Oh okay  Now I want you to say  They don't make them like that anymore  They don't make them like that anymore 
[03:02:30]  Yes they do  She's learning  Yes  I want to have it  Spick and span  I want to have it  Clean and empty  I want to have it ready  To have someone else  Be able to move in with me  Someone that I love  This is a stupid problem  For people to have  I would have dated her  And then just went over  To her house one day  While she was shopping  And thrown half her shit out 
[03:03:00]  Oh how great would that be  Then dumped her  God stupid  Have fun at home tonight  Looking at all that space  Just screaming  At her missing things  I can't replace it  And I would just remind her  Remember how  That was irreplaceable  Where'd it go  Take a picture of you  Burning that box  And laughing  Like I'd have one hand  Above my head  Waving to the Lord  And the other hand  Pointing and laughing  Hey let's go to Adam  In California  Adam  Hey what's up guys  Hey  Hey  I've been living with 
[03:03:30]  My parents  My mom's been like this  For a long time  Right  And it's worse  As they get older  And my dad and I  Went in there before  And cleaned out  The whole house before  And she came out  Unglued  Dude  She flipped  She knew where  Everything was at  Everything  And now that  All the kids  Are going out of the house  She has dogs in there  And she just  Let some shit everywhere  Like no question  Just doesn't even  Pick it up  We cleaned out  Our pantry one time  And found 
[03:04:00]  Salad dressing in there  That was like  Like 8  Or 10 years old  Disgusting  Do you have a salad?  I couldn't eat that  She'd leave chicken out  Wait she really  Just lets the dog  Shit  Outside  For a day and a half  And then want to  Cook it for dinner  And she lets the dog  Just shit  Everywhere  Doesn't the smell  Get to her?  Do you ask her this stuff?  Well  Eventually my dad  Will come by  And try to clean it up  A little bit  But the smell is in there 
[03:04:30]  There's nothing  You can do about it now  Oh of course  When did your dad  Leave your mom?  Well he came to live  With us for about  Six months  And then had to go back  Because he felt bad for her  So he ended up  Going back to her  I'll tell you what  He left her  The minute he came home  And saw Wednesday  Through Wednesday  Newspapers  He was like  I'm fucking done  With this  Gone  Goodbye  Did you do anything?  An intervention?  Nothing you can do  Nothing  Because like  Another guy said earlier  Is that  They'll treat them 
[03:05:00]  For just a little while  Especially in California  Because there's really  No place that you  Can send them to  They'll treat them  For like two days  And then let  Let them go  Hey they're not  Hurting anybody  I mean as far as  Like in society  They're not a burden  On society  They're just shitheads  No offense  Unless you go by  Your mom's a shithead  Yeah no offense  To your mom dude  I mean she's fine  But  The fire department  Came by and  Told them they had  To clean up the house  Of course  Because it's starting  To look real bad  All the neighbors  Are complaining  Right 
[03:05:30]  I mean it does  Affect other people  But  Yeah well you know  What I'm saying  They're not criminals  It's like  They're not  Not yet  Alright Adam  Thanks for that  Wonderful story  Joe has  A similar story  From Jersey  Joe  Yeah hi  We had  I had an uncle  He passed away  And he had a little  Bit of money  I mean not like  Opie money  But I mean he had money  Come on he does  What's that  So anyway  He  Anyway  He would fill up  Let my friends  Finish laughing 
[03:06:00]  So  He would fill up  One trail  He was a trail  Apart guy  Full of crap  And then move  And buy another trailer  And then fill that  Full of shit  And like when we went  To clean it out  And he passed away  You'd have all these  Coolers full of like  Rancid meat  And his car had like  Had um  Fucking lunch meat  That was dated  Six months before  He passed away  Just like sitting  Underneath of it  I mean the whole place  Was just a total  I don't get this  Do you know what 
[03:06:30]  I wish I could save  I wish I could save  Hugs  So I could open  Them on a sad day  Aw  Hoarding hugs  I wanna hoard  I wanna have a bottle  Of hugs  That I can open  When I'm sad  Alright Joe  Thank you  What a great thought  It is  But no I want  A bottle of hugs  What is this  I want a whole closet  Full of kisses  That's a site I  Is there a hoarding site  Well this is some  Mother  I forget where  But she apparently  Just buys like  Ridiculous shit 
[03:07:00]  Off ebay  Never even bothers  To open the boxes  Half the time  And just keeps  All this shit  In her house  Right  Yeah there's boxes  All over her place  That's boring  I wanna see like  A shit hoarder  See I think  At least I throw it out  When I'm done with it  Spit it out  I wanna see a shit hoarder  I think any family member  That tolerates this  Is just as guilty  Why not  Throw everything out  Take a day  Where you're taking  A mom out  You're taking her out 
[03:07:30]  To the movies  And have the rest  Of the family  Come over  One trip in the truck  Throw everything out  Then when she comes home  And loses her fucking mind  That's where the confrontation comes  You go you know  Why we did this  Don't you  Videotape her  And just laugh  And laugh  And laugh  Hey let me say  For the record  My parents  Listen to this program  And I love you both  If you start  Hoarding  Things  I will hire  A negro  To smother you  Jesus 
[03:08:00]  With your  Hoarded crap  That's right  That's being killed  With something you saved  So long  Because you thought  It was so special  And there's the last thing  You see  Is it pressed  Against your face  A sturdy  Box full of  Mouse duty  Got a hoarder's  Apartment  Oh my god  It's just bags  And boxes  Of shit  Expired cereal  Well you need that  We obviously  All have it in us  To like  Save stuff  We save stuff  But then whatever  That part of the brain is  That tells you
