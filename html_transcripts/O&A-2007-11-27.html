<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a defiant assertion of their right to be offensive, setting the tone for the entire show.  Patrice O'Neal filled in for Jim Norton.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to "Makeup Stuff Tuesday," a recurring segment where they invented a fake news story. This week's fabricated news stories included tales about Kanye West, Hillary Clinton, and Natalie Holloway, following the surprisingly unsuccessful "Hitler balloon" story from the previous week.  A caller even claimed to have believed the "Hitler balloon" story.  The hosts then transitioned into a discussion about a previous incident where Jim Norton's complaint about AT&T surprisingly resulted in a positive resolution of his billing issues.

The show then covered the death of NFL player Sean Taylor, leading into a lengthy discussion about Anthony's elaborate home security measures, which involved numerous firearms and detailed defense plans. This sparked a debate on paranoia, with callers offering diverse perspectives. Ginger, a female caller, initially criticized Anthony's actions but later apologized after sharing a personal experience. Another caller, Frank, graphically described shooting two intruders during a home invasion.

The conversation continued to focus on Anthony's home security preparations and the line between sensible caution and excessive fear, fueled by further caller anecdotes and Lydia, a clinical psychologist, labeling Anthony's behavior as obsessive.  Humorous moments included exaggerated descriptions of Anthony's gun-handling skills and jokes about a "mush factor" in older women, sparked by a caller's experience dating a 52-year-old woman. This led to a discussion about older women ("cougars") dating younger men, fueled by a news story about British women traveling to Kenya for sex with younger men. Callers shared experiences with older women, highlighting both the positive and negative aspects.  The discussion was punctuated by crude and offensive language, including the repeated use of racial slurs in a news story (later played with the slurs bleeped out), and a caller's story about a sexual encounter with a woman missing teeth. Patrice O'Neal promoted her website and podcast.

A caller named Annie, a 41-year-old woman from Queens, shared her difficulties finding a partner, lamenting younger men only interested in sex and an older married man's advances.  This prompted a discussion on dating, marriage, and the perceived devaluation of women, contrasting Annie's desire for a long-term relationship with the hosts' cynical views.  Annie's five-year abstinence and strong beliefs about marriage were contrasted with the hosts' more casual approach.  The show then played audio clips from "Loper and Schmitty," Opie and Anthony's replacement in West Palm Beach.  The hosts reacted negatively to the show's content, including a mocking intro, awkward trivia ("Wake and Bake Trivia"), and poor on-air chemistry.  Multiple listener calls provided further opinions on Annie's situation, the new show, and even one caller's mother's dating habits involving much younger Mexican men.  Opie and Anthony expressed their frustration at being replaced and commented on the state of radio.

The show then shifted to a further, even more vehement critique of "The Morning Buzz," hosted by Looper and Smitty, featuring extensive audio clips showcasing their perceived phoniness and forced edginess.  Patrice O'Neal was again present in studio. The hosts used highly offensive language while expressing their disgust.  Listener calls largely agreed with their assessment. Opie and Anthony speculated that the show's inauthenticity was due to program director directives.

Finally, the show included a segment with Patrice O'Neal focusing on unrestrained conversation filled with highly offensive language. Topics ranged from racial stereotypes to O'Neal's comedic views on abortion and the Iraq War, along with critiques of American culture, politics, and society.  Notable moments included O'Neal's comedic bit on the versatility of "motherfucker," jokes about Ellen DeGeneres, commentary on television programming, and crude humor including jokes about anal sex in ancient Greece.  O'Neal promoted his stand-up performances before the show concluded with a "line of the day" about menopause and large penises.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  The biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their audience.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go screwed.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  What?  Hold on.  Whose fault was that delay?  No  Oh, is it?  Correct, open, humiliated  What do you mean right in front of me?  When you just end like that, I had to tie it up 
[00:01:00]  Dude, I looked at you and went, boom, like go  That was sloppy  If you had to say a celebrity that you most resemble, who would you say?  Jodie Foster?  If she ate the real Jodie Foster  Silence of the Hams  This is where entertainment is going  I do not touch that  The only things that may touch that is toilet paper and baby wipes  I am right now  Holy, oh my god  They are sick freaks  How close did you get to having relations with a dog?  You have to put oven mitts on all the German shepherds 
[00:01:30]  So we don't scratch marches  It's time for people to understand  These are words  If you don't like them, turn the dial  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  Wakey, wakey  It's Opie  It's Anthony  Hi  It's Patrice  O'Neill  In the house 
[00:02:00]  In for the vacationing Jim Norton  I don't know what Jimmy's doing  But he's out  Jimmy's becoming a star  He's out  It's the Opie and Anthony show  The ONA virus spreading across America  A few things  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A  Instant feedback  I don't know how to promote that  I don't know  Because the one we read  Yeah 
[00:02:30]  Is on another website that we can't promote  Is it the website that has our name in it?  Yeah  But there's another instant feedback  That is on ONA radio.com  But we don't read that one  That's crazy  Why can't they just be on the same one?  And I gave up asking  I don't know if they solved that problem or not  So  Fix it  Ah, people figure it out  Believe me, they're smart  I don't know if they figure that out 
[00:03:00]  We mentioned that a while ago  We really need to figure that out  Some of them  Because the instant feedback we read  Is the really good one  Right here to my right  Yeah  Don't want to confuse the issue  I don't want to start promoting a brand new one  No  These guys have been using this instant feedback  For, I don't know  Over three years now  See, so they know how to get to it, right?  Yeah, but you want to get some new people  That might have some creativity in their soul  Some new blood  Need some new blood to, you know  Kind of contribute to the radio show  Yeah  I ask every week 
[00:03:30]  Steve C  That was the communique I just got  What is the  What could possibly be the problem with that?  That's a simple fix  That seems very easy  How about we fix some of the simple things around here?  Gave up on the hard stuff a long time ago  But let's not give up on the simple things that we can fix  Please  And of course we got the PalTalk cameras in here as well  Yes, hello  All right  We got lots to do today  It's Makeup Stuff Tuesday  Yeah, we were pondering a few things in the office 
[00:04:00]  You know how Makeup Stuff Tuesday works  The first hour of the show pretty much  We come up with something that's a complete fabrication  Yes  Completely fake  It's a lie  It's false  And we let you in on it  The people that are listening from 6 to 7 a.m. Eastern  And then after 7 o'clock we just don't mention that it's fake  And we go on and present it as fact  That's right  And people seem to believe this 
[00:04:30]  And the joke is on them  Because everybody else that was listening early gets to go tee hee hee that's funny  Because it's fake  And we have  And you know it  We've had tremendous success with this little bit of ours  Yes  Gotten us a little press  Until last week when we tried to tell everybody that there was a Hitler balloon  In the Thanksgiving Day Parade  No one believed that there was a Hitler balloon in the Thanksgiving Day Parade  And we sold it pretty good too man  It was really working the Hitler balloon angle and no one seemed to care  We had a nice little angle 
[00:05:00]  We were very vague about what the balloon looked like  I don't know if no one cared  Or they didn't believe it  Like I tend to think no one cared  They would welcome the Hitler balloon  I think we went a little too outrageous last night  That was a little too out there  So now the challenge is on  A fine line isn't it  Now the challenge is on to come up with something that's a little more believable than the Hitler balloon  So Patrice if you have a fake news story that would be nice  So just think it over  Just something that we could say 
[00:05:30]  And people are gullible enough to start believing  And then they go to work and tell their friends  And that's where the joke happens  Because then the people at work that do listen to the show are like  You're just stupid  Believe in that crap  Yeah something that people can really grab onto  And chatter about at work  And we're at a loss today  So we might take one for the listeners  Yeah sometimes the listeners come up with good ideas  I'm thinking maybe we tell everybody that Isaiah Thomas got fired  But that's an easy one  That's sort of niche too 
[00:06:00]  I mean of course basketball is pretty big  But you're not going to get everybody talking about it  We want a national story  We want like a national story yeah  Something like Hulk Hogan is getting a divorce  Because he was caught having sex with the blue meanie  Something like that  Something yeah  Maybe a Hulk Hogan divorce  Man on man sex with the blue meanie  Is causing the divorce with his wife  How about Don I'm a sis I'm racist again  Ooh I like that 
[00:06:30]  But he's not on the radio yet  Next week he starts  It's a lie  He is on the radio  Yeah see people don't know  Ah  On his first day back  Why stop with the  With the little lies  Just the whole big lie  He's like  It's fact and it's lie  First day back  He threw out the N-bomb eight times  In the first hour  Let's go to the phones  We got Jack in Ohio  Good afternoon to Cleveland  How are you Jack?  Hey LNA  Hey  John in Cleveland  I'm on XM  I'm listening to you live 
[00:07:00]  Alright cool  What do you got man?  I love throwing myself out of the bus  You guys got me on the Hitler balloon  Oh we got you on the Hitler balloon?  You believe the Hitler balloon?  Ah Thanksgiving day  We're watching the parade  My wife and family  And I'm telling them  Ah there's going to be a Hitler balloon  You gotta wait for it  You gotta wait for it  Here it comes  I think  Oh no a cat in the head  Ah that's great  I thought  I thought more people  Would go with the Hitler balloon thing  Yeah  Just cause we  We  I don't know  We sold it  I thought just right 
[00:07:30]  It could happen  It could happen  Cause people like  Is it going to be  Adolf Hitler  His face on a balloon  Like I don't really know  We're not sure  We kept it vague  That would obviously be outrageous  There's gotta be more to this  Than we know  Do you think we kept it too vague  Or we should have  Actually described the balloon  It's a 50 foot high  Adolf Hitler  Giving the  Sig Heil salute  Yeah  Like really make it  Offensive  That might have worked  Alright  37 people died 
[00:08:00]  Eating Purdue turkeys  This past  You think that'll do it  Yeah  And then we'll have  Tom Chisano run in  And say  Purdue's a sponsor  Oh my god  You went after another sponsor  What are you doing  Don't you know sponsors  Don't have senses of humor  I must say  Speaking of that  Yeah  Remember when  Jimmy was going off  About  American  Telephone and Telegraph  AT&T  Ah yes  He was going off  About that  And Tom came in 
[00:08:30]  And said  Hey they're a sponsor  Yeah  And then  Jimmy said something like  Well you know  I just had a problem  With them  So I thought  I'd voice it  Well I got something  To say about AT&T  Oh boy  I got a phone call  After that  Tirade  Of Jimmy Norton's  From AT&T  And was explained  They explained  Everything to me  And changed around  My billing plan  Gave me  A credit  And gave me

[00:12:30]  Uh  Obama here  I heard he might  Have had some sort  Of a homosexual  Experience once  Back  And then he might  Pass some doubt  On his uh  Cam  Well  I thought  I don't  I think I'd steer  Clear of that one  Two but  Oh no  I  I personally love it  I love it Seth  Alright we're in  Uh we'll try to figure out  How we can  Word that one  Word that 
[00:13:00]  Speaking of Obama  Uh the Oprah factor  It's all over the papers  Today  Yeah  Uh it's on the front page  Of our papers here in New York  Uh well  She's endorsing Obama  Officially  Well she's going along  Racial lines I think  No surprise there  I think uh  Uh the community  Would be outraged  If she didn't uh  Back Obama  And says  Can this woman  Change the face  Of politics  Forever  Mmm  He ain't a book  Huh  I know she sells books  But I don't know  If she could sell a president 
[00:13:30]  So you think all those uh  White  Housewives that  That buy the Oprah book  Aren't gonna buy the uh  I don't think they're gonna  Buy the black guy  For the president  I'm very surprised  She didn't pick women  Yeah yeah  That like  Well I'm sure it was  Very difficult for her  Decision  Where would I go  With the women  She had to pick Hillary  I don't think  The woman  Or uh  Obama  The race  Yeah  I think gender is more  Powerful than race  Personally  Yeah  She should have picked Hillary  Right  I don't know who she  Should have picked  But I mean  I wouldn't have been surprised 
[00:14:00]  If she picked Hillary  Either one  Yeah  And I don't think  Anybody would have  Called her like  No no  I don't think she'd have  Taken heat for that  Because  It doesn't matter  A Republican  Is gonna win anyway  Well the latest poll  Really is  The latest poll  Is saying that Hillary  Would lose to every  Single Republican  Candidate  Even a dude  From uh  Die Hard 2  Well except for him  Yeah yeah  He's great  I love him as an actor  I  I  I think he'd make  A great president  He can play a president  I'm just 
[00:14:30]  I don't want to see him  As a president  I love him  I love him in Die Hard 2  He always plays  The great boss  Of whatever  He's supposed  To be the boss  Of  Sure  Poll  Poll shows  Hillary Clinton  Would lose to  Every Republican  Head to head  Wow  That's coming out  Today as well  How many people  Do they ask  10 or 12  And how many  People do they  Represent  Do polls work  Yeah they seem to  So they represent  Like what  100,000 a person  Yeah  Yeah  They pretty much  Know who's gonna  Be president  Five minutes 
[00:15:00]  After the voting  Begins  Yep  Nobody  See the trends  Yeah  Except for the year  Of the Al Gore  Well that debacle  The year of the Al Gore  The hanging chads  Who met the president  Yesterday  Has any president  Ever made a human  Difference in this world  Like just a  A real difference  As a human being  Other than that  Petsky Lincoln  I'm a  Budinsky  Are you saying  He's the last president  That actually did  That you remember 
[00:15:30]  For doing something  Significant  It's significant  On a human  On a human level  What about Kennedy  What did he do  F-ing all those broads  That's pretty significant  That's how it is  That's pretty significant  And Truman  Dropping a couple  Of giant mushrooms  But other than that  Has any president  Done anything  Wonderful for this country  Where you  As a regular person  No  I don't think  You know  There's just a fear  From politicians now  They're too scared  To do anything 
[00:16:00]  On a human level  Because too many  Other humans  Get upset by it  They're afraid  To annoy anybody  So they don't do  Anything for anybody  They just sit there  Like what's Bush done  Aside from the war  The war is a huge thing  That's his legacy  That is his legacy  Absolutely  He's done nothing  But the war  And now  He's in the home stretch  Of his presidency  And he's going to try  To get a peace  Plan together  Between  What he's got  Syria in there  And Israel  And  It's such a joke 
[00:16:30]  He's brokering  A peace plan  As he's just  Bombing the hell  Out of a country  That's  Look you gotta  Wherever you're at  You gotta either  You know  Agree with the war thing  Or the peace thing  You can't be like  Juggling both  At the same time  If you're into war  Be war guy  If you're into peace  Be peace guy  Like Jimmy Carter's  Peace guy  Yeah  President Bush is war guy  War guy  His legacy is  That idiot should've been war guy  He should've been 
[00:17:00]  Just 100% war guy  No one is kidnapping  Any of Bush's citizens  Yeah  It's just  He's a war guy  As soon as I heard that  He's like you know  Negotiating some peace stuff  I'm like oh come on  Stop already  Just cause every president  Before you tried  You have to now try  He wants to get that picture  Of the guys shaking hands  In front of him  Right  So he can smile  And he holds up their  Both of their fists  In the middle  Yeah yeah  Yeah that picture  How many times  Has that been done  And they're still 
[00:17:30]  Blowing each other up  Over there  They're ridiculous  You know this girl  Told me why  They wear burqas  This Muslim girl  She's a middle of the road  Muslim like she's not  But she just said  Why those women over there  Wear the things  That cover their face  Yeah  And again Muslims  Don't be upset  I'm paraphrasing  Cause I just heard  This ridiculousness  Oh boy here comes  The Imus man  I don't know  It's basically true  Oh we can say  This is lie Tuesday  But anyway  Whoever the boss is  Whoever the Jesus is 
[00:18:00]  Like for Muslims  Yeah  His son  Like had a pretty wife  And he was turned on  By her  And then he made her  Put on that thing  So he would be  Turned on by his son's wife  Wow  If I'm not  If I'm  You can fix it up  If I'm wrong  But basically  It's not God said so  It's the dude  Was horny  Looking at his son's wife  That's not farfetched  I would assume  That there  There is a problem  If you have to wrap  Your women up 
[00:18:30]  To the point where  You can't even look  At their eyes  There is a problem  With them being  Being turned on  By women  It's not even  A godly gesture  No  It's just a dude  God would be able  To shut that off  He would be able  To go  Well I'm getting  A little turned  But I'm God  So I'm not  Turned on anymore  You know  But yeah  To have to slap clothes  From the top of their head  To their feet  You know  That's a  That's a human thing

Like that's personal, dude  Somebody was asking this dude, man  Yeah  He didn't make it through the night, huh?  And I bet when they shot him  I bet you it's something  Because, you know  No one shoots you in the leg  And just like you said  A lot of people with guns  They watch movies  So it's just like  Yo, I want my money  Or yo, you want my girl  Or da-da-da  Bow  Shoot him in the leg  He's okay  Some type of warning  Let you know I'm serious

Uh  No, I don't think so  No?  That's not the artery that's used to fill up the balloon?  No, no  That's a big one, though  You've got to have a big pipe there to carry the blood down to your foot  You know, it's got to start out pretty big 
[00:29:30]  Well, that's breaking news  Because we got an update just before we went on the air  They didn't have anything on him  No, that just came in  Is that true?

[00:30:30]  Sleeping with your big pistols  That's right  You've got to sleep with your guns  Sleep with your guns  And your cab partition on your front  In front of your doorway  Yeah, the cab part  One of those  What's that movie with Jodie Foster?  Oh, yeah  I need a  The panic room  The panic room  I need my panic room  This panic house  I do have a pullback point  In my house  I have a retreat point  What's a pullback point? 
[00:31:00]  That's like your  People that aren't paranoid  That's your rally point  That's where you go  When  Your rally point  Yeah, that's  That's where you go  You pull back  And that's your last resort  And what's your code  And  For everybody in the house  Your cat and your girlfriend  To get to that rally point  That's like  Oh, man  Rally point  Rally point  Being overtaken  Zips in the wire  Unleash 
[00:31:30]  Unleash hell on my paws  Been a lovely effing war  A pullback point  See, I got my pullback point  Which is my gigantic walk-in closet  In the bedroom  See, now the door to the walk-in closet  Right to one side of it  Is my cover point  That's where I have a complete  Line of sight 
[00:32:00]  He's figured all this out  Just listen to how crazy he is  And overlapping fields of fire  Yeah  Into the door  Coming into the bedroom  No one can enter my bedroom  When I am at this cover point  I have full cover  I am behind a wall  I have full cover  And anyone coming in the bedroom door  Is completely exposed to my fire  What if they have marble bombs?  Marble bombs?  The bombs that roll like marbles  Into your closet 
[00:32:30]  If they have that stuff  Then I'm dead  Take it  God bless  No one has gotten marble bombed  During a home invasion  They get choked with phone cords  They get pistol whipped  No one's marble bombing  So I haven't taken a defense up  For marble bombing  But I will do a little research  Into it  If they use that James Bond crap  Then take whatever you want  But I  So I have a point  Where I am taking cover  If somehow  I don't see how this is happening 
[00:33:00]  I get overrun  I can back off  Into my walk-in closet  Leaving just one entry point  And then have to pile the bodies  Up at the door  Now let me ask you this  Yes sir  What's your  Warning system  Uh  I have  I have an alarm  Against tiptoes  Oh I have an alarm system  He's got an alarm system  That thing is gonna  Let me know  Someone's in the house  When the alarm goes off  You are in the closet  No no  I'm at my cover point  Next to the closet 
[00:33:30]  With a bead drawn  On the door  To the bedroom  Now I'm undercover  But if they got heavy fire  Then you  If it's a few guys  With some real heavy fire  And I have to pull back  I could pull back  To my closet  And that's where  I have more guns  In the closet  Let me ask you this  Can you survive  A Scarface scenario  Uh  I wouldn't play it  I wouldn't play it  Like Scarface did  I wouldn't play it off  Like Scarface did  No  I'm not gonna stand there  And get shot  So you would lose 
[00:34:00]  To marble bombs  And the Scarface scenario  No I think I could  Play out the Scarface scenario  For a while  For quite a while  After you kill  Your sister's boyfriend  Yeah  And then  And then I have to  And she's  In a sexy gown  Saying  Yeah  Tony Tony  Dawn has to buy it  In the sexy gown  My poor sister  Has gotta buy it  A Scarface scenario  With that big  Big head of hair  Scarface scenario  You don't just stand up  By the railing though  And start like shooting  And go  Come on  Come on  You know  That's silly 
[00:34:30]  I have a funny feeling  That this ass  Would get killed  In his sleep  Oh no  As the alarm goes off  And you just go  And I'm all groggy  Yeah  People open up on me  With a pistol  Right to your stupid head  All this  I'm up  And there's nothing  That'll save you  It's gonna end up  Shooting someone  Close to them  And they just  Want to come over  With an apple pie  No  No  First of all  I will always  Identify my target  I would never 
[00:35:00]  I have  I have lights  On my guns  I have night vision  Of course you do  I have holographic sights  Of course you do  I  Believe me  I have equipment  You have a silencer  That's made out of a potato  No  I don't have the potato silencer  I want noise  I want noise  To let them know  If I fire  Let's say  What's your little friend  My little friend  What gun is your little friend  Say hello to your  Right now it's the gauge  The gauge  That's your little friend 
[00:35:30]  The 12 gauge  Is great  For home invasion  Especially with a door  He's figured all this out Patrice  If I take cover by the door  Someone's coming in the door  I'm hitting them  And I don't want a lot of collateral damage  If I pull out my AR-15  You know  There's going to be rounds  Flying through the walls  And it may hit your neighbors  Right  And then I got my AK  There's another one  That could hit your neighbors  I got the AK-47  Yeah that's another one  But those are in the closet 
[00:36:00]  How about your 50-50  On top of the roof  That's my  That's my like  My fallback point  Then  There's no more rules  Then I gotta  I can't worry about collateral damage  I'm shooting through the door  With both of those guns  I will have the AK and the AR  One in each hand  And just firing through the door  So the gauge is  It's friendly to the neighbors  But very deadly to the invaders  Exactly  If someone comes through that door 
[00:36:30]  That bedroom door  He is getting at least a groin  And lower belly full of 12 gauge  And you got them in places where  It's just like you can press a button  That snaps out  Or it's hanging somewhere  All I have to do  He doesn't want to  Is roll off the bed  Yeah he doesn't want to  Tell you where his guns are  I roll off the bed  And that thing is in my hands  It's under the bed  In my hands  And I'm at my cover point  It's under the bed  Like  No  Hold on  Someone's saying  That's not cover  Mike in Connecticut  Go ahead  Hey guys 
[00:37:00]  How you doing  Alright Mike  How you doing  I'm doing really great  Really great  Listen  There's a huge difference  Between cover and concealment  What you've got in your  In your spot there  Is you've got concealment  But anything  Even a centerfire handgun round  Will go right through that  You've got to get cover  You've got to have  You're referring to it as cover  But you need to have cover  What you've got is  You're hiding out  But anybody can shoot  Right through the walls  First of all  It is concealment  They won't be looking for me there 
[00:37:30]  When they come in  I will have the element of surprise  I will be hidden  And they will be completely exposed  Walking through the bedroom door  Once that door  Once they walk through that door  And are identified as hostiles  I open fire  Now where's your bed  In relation to the door  Where's your head  It's the furthest point  From the door  Like when you look  So to see your front door  You look down at your feet  You look over to the right 
[00:38:00]  You look up to the left  Yeah it's pretty much  Straight ahead  Down at your feet  Yeah yeah  And something else to add to this  And I could see  Completely down my hallway  I could see  Like I could see  Pretty far  You see what you're doing  Open and close  The bedroom door  Sometimes open  Sometimes closed  I like a little mystery  You've got to throw them off  A little mystery  A little fact  Anthony  Supposedly is building  A pool  In the backyard  But I believe  At this point 
[00:38:30]  It's a moat  You think it's a moat  I think it's a moat  With oil  He's got the pool  He's taking meetings  With a pool company  Off and on  For the last month  But I think they're  Installing a moat  At this point  Can you dodge bullets  Can you do a little  Matrix thing  No I don't think  I'd be doing any matrix  No  Trying to like  Well that would be  Some cool stuff  Running sideways  On the walls  Can you do some  Deep back bends  Firing off  How about a little  Back bend  Yeah bend back  Watch the round  Just miss me  I pop up 
[00:39:00]  Wham  The guy's gone  Do you guys  Sharpened tree  Twig  Booby traps  Pungy sticks  No I don't have  Any of those  They tell us  They're just  Sharpie sticks  He knows all  The terminology  I don't have those  But he studies  This crap late at night  When he should be sleeping  I do have some  Bayonets and swords  If you know  Nothing  If I'm attacked  By I don't know  A knight  I can fend him  Off with a sword  Or a rapier  Why are you 
[00:39:30]  This paranoia  Is this really paranoia  Is it real  Let's think realistically  Here  Is this paranoia  The way you live in  It just sounds  It just sounds  Like something's wrong  This is nothing  This doesn't sound  Sexy at all  Like  I enjoy these  Kind of conversations  But it just  Doesn't sound sexy  To live like  This is  I don't live like this  I have healthy paranoia  But you're gonna kill somebody  I don't live like this  I don't drill  I don't you know  Go through things  I just am prepared  So that if I'm in a situation 
[00:40:00]  Where there's a home invasion  All I can think of  When I hear of a home invasion  Is the fact that  Whoever is being invaded  And that phone cord's  Around their neck  Or the daughter's being assaulted  Or the wife is  And the husband's being pistol whipped  Is the one thing  That guy is saying  And I know it  Is  God damn  I wish I had a gun  I wish I had had a gun  Right  When those  Mother effers  Walked in that door  I could have defended my family 
[00:40:30]  And that's all I'm talking about  I don't  I don't pick up my guns every day  And go  Yeah come on in baby  Come on  You're all dead  Are you feeling okay  I don't say that  Are you feeling okay today  I'm fine  Are you sure  Yeah why  You're out of your mind  No it's just to have it there  I never  I never heard you speak this fast  In my life  It's very safe  Alright take a deep breath  It's  It's okay  It's much more safe  It's okay  To know that it's there 
[00:41:00]  Alright  Breathe  Than to have to worry  And not have it there  If you need it  I live in a county  That has had many home invasions  What is your description  Of your assailants  Your possible assailants  My possible assailants  In my mind  You envision  Okay  It's the exact same description  Of every single assailant  From every single home invasion 
[00:41:30]  That has happened in Nassau County  It can't be black  Of course it is  Black people in Nassau County  Don't come up in the home invasion  They go from Hempstead  Patrice I gotta back him up on this one  It's always black guys  Yeah  They go from Hempstead  And Uniondale  And they drive to the nicer neighborhoods  They home invade  A car full of black guys  Yeah  How many are there usually  Usually three  On average  And they're driving through Nassau County  I can't drive through any of these counties 
[00:42:00]  Without ever getting pulled over  For no reason  They go to certain houses  That are close to escape routes  Major highways  Things like that  Well  Not close  There's another scam  That happens on Long Island  Where people will follow you home  Yeah  They will pick you up  On the Long Island Expressway  They see your nice car  They know the exits  To the nice neighborhoods  And they follow you  Right to your driveway  That ain't happening  And rob you right in your driveway  I got eyes  In the back of my head  What's your preparation there 
[00:42:30]  I have  How much does it cost  To build a bat  Like a bat cave  Down  Drive down  In the driveway  Into your home  Underneath  A button that you push  Where you drive down  And it comes back up  I don't need it  You know why  I look  Every day  Going in and out  Of my garage  And I have  First of all  I got the camera  In the back  Of the Escalade  So now  In the morning  When that garage door  Is going up 
[00:43:00]  I start the car  First  Put it in reverse  Now I see my camera  And all I see  Is the garage door  Hold on  Are you giving away  Too much info  No  No  No  And then I see  The garage door go up  And I'm looking  I'm looking at that camera  That's all I'm looking at  If I see anybody  Creeping in  I gas that thing  And it's in reverse already  Wham  I'm out of there  They ain't getting me  But they get  Boom I'm out of there  But they get your girl  That's still in the house  No because the door 
[00:43:30]  Is locked  Ah see he's figured  The door's locked  I have like an airlock  Type seal  He's not well  There are  I know I love it  There are steps  That you take  You don't leave  One door open  And then open another one  It's got to be like  An airlock  You have to lock this one  Before you open this one  That way people aren't  Just running into your house  And there's an acceptable  Like it's almost  An acceptable paranoia  Like it's acceptable  And he's very clear 
[00:44:00]  Paranoia  I've thought it out  I've well thought out  My defense  I am not going to be  One of these guys  That has a cord  Around his neck  Going  I wish I would have  Thought about this  All he's doing  Is using his  Video gaming skills  Well of course  You've got to use  Video gaming skills  First person shooter  And applying  You're going to be  Shooting a person  And it's going to be  In the first person perspective  And he's just applying it  To his real life  That's it Patrice  That's all he's doing 
[00:44:30]  It's more than that  Oh yeah he's  Completely nuts  You've got to keep  Guns  Everywhere  We're all whispering  Behind his back  Trust me  Guns all over the place  That way you're never  Taken by surprise  There's a lot of  Chatter about Anthony  When he's not around  What about this game  To visit you unannounced  That's fine  You would be crazy  I'm not  Let me tell you something  With the color of your skin  Going unannounced  To Anthony's house  Would not be a good idea  No  No  No  Anthony  Yo it's me  Look outside nigga  I have 
[00:45:00]  I have  People of color  At my house  A lot  People of color  They deliver things  They deliver like furniture  I have  Mexicans  That come in  And they clean the house  On a weekly basis  What about the furniture  Deliverer that looks  Around your house  And goes yo  This is a nice house man  They've said that  Oh boy  When they go  This is a nice house  I make sure  That where  Anything is being delivered  I put down  My copies of 
[00:45:30]  Guns and ammo  And  I stick a gun  In the corner  Just kind of  Sitting there  And go yeah  It goes right there  So they know  I am an armed citizen  And it's going to be  A fight getting into my house  They can get to the gun  Before you  Yeah I think that  Makes them think  Oh we got a gun now  Right  We can get a gun  No  This dude got mad magazines  He got a lot of magazines  He got a lot of guns  He got a lot of stuff  Exactly  And I'm going to steal the couch  I just delivered  They would rather  Break into a house  With some old people  That are going to be  Cringing and bleeding 
[00:46:00]  Than break into a house  Where they know somebody  Is an armed citizen  We got to take a break  This is unbelievable man  Oh this is  He discusses this  From time to time  And believe me  I would  I am not reckless  I would look  Identifying your target  Is number one priority  You're not reckless  With a bunker in your bedroom  That's not reckless  It's not reckless  It's safe  Hey we got audio  Of Anthony starting his car  And leaving to go to work  Listen to this  Atomic batteries to power  Turbines to speed 
[00:46:30]  Roger  Ready to move out  That's Anthony  Hey we got to take a break  We can continue with this  After the break  No problem  Because you got the phones lit  Do you practice how long  You can hold your breath  In a bathtub  Well  No he  He puts his head underwater  But he has  Just one little straw  Popping up  Through the bubble bath  That's it  And breathing  By the way  We got Lydia  From Oceanside 
[00:47:00]  She's on the phone  We'll talk to her next  Because she's a psychologist  And she says  Ant really is crazy  Oh okay  Make sure she goes nowhere  We want to talk to her next  I'll talk to her next  It's Opie and Anthony  It's the Opie and Anthony show  A very busy one  The phones are lit  877-212-ON-A  If you're just tuning in  Quiet Riot singer found dead  In Las Vegas home  Don't know the cause yet  Sean Taylor 
[00:47:30]  Died overnight  From the gunshot  That he  He received  And  Was it a home invasion  We don't know right  We don't really know  The details on that  But he did not survive  The night  No  Also we'll have more  On Kanye West's arrest  Rap superstar Kanye West  Is in custody  After allegedly killing 
[00:48:00]  Dr. Jan Adams  That's the guy that  Allegedly killed his mom  With the surgery  Right right right  The plastic surgery  She had  Yeah some kind of  Cosmetic surgery  And apparently Kanye West  Is in custody  I guess the guy was  Found dead or something  So they're looking into that  Also coming in  Today you got 
[00:48:30]  Oprah Winfrey  Backing Obama  For the presidency  And Hillary  Is saying today  That she won't rule out  Vice President Bill  Yeah actually  Taking on her hubby  And former President  Bill Clinton  As a  Vice Presidential  Candidate  To run with her  That  That I think  Is probably the best  Move she can make  Because people kind of  Like Bill Clinton  You know  That would be really  Interesting because  It's also coming out 
[00:49:00]  Today a poll  Shows Hillary  Would lose to every  Republican  Head to head  So she needs to do  Something  She needs to mix it up  And this is one of  Those rash moves  That I think  Probably boost her up  In the polls  There you go  Also on the way  We're going to talk  About cougars  On the hunt  In Kenya  And not the cougars  That you would expect  To be on the hunt  No you know  Yeah  Cougar hunting  You know  Older women  Looking for younger guys  Well  The older white women  Are going to Kenya 
[00:49:30]  For young  Black  There's a great  Great  Piece on that  In the paper  Oh yeah  New York City  Remember Ginger  From yesterday  Yeah  She was the  Woman that doesn't like  Guys playing video games  Well we did a whole thing  On video games yesterday  And she was like  Boring  And she was kind of  I didn't like her  I told her right to her face  I didn't like her  What so ever  She doesn't understand  Guys that play video games  Right  Well she's on the line 
[00:50:00]  She wants to say something  And then we also have Lydia  The psychologist  Who thinks Ant  Is really crazy  And then we have a guy  That actually killed two people  In a home invasion  So we got a lot  A lot of things  To get to right now  Ginger what's going on  Yeah hi  I really wanted to apologize  For that generalization  About men playing video games  It turns out  It's really just Anthony  That's the turn off  Oh  Why is Anthony  A turn off  Thank you  Well because you're like  With your home invasion thing  You're like a kid  In junior high 
[00:50:30]  Who  Who got money  What  Please explain  The way that you're  Outfitting your home  Your video games  Your home invasion  You're backing out  Of your driveway  You're like a kid  You're not like a man  A kid  Wait  Don't you  Don't you  You don't see at all  That I'm just concerned  About safety  You live in Long Island  You know  You're not in Iraq  Have you  Have you looked at  The news Ginger  At all  Have you looked at  The news  Have you seen 
[00:51:00]  That Nassau County  Has had nothing  But home invasions  Nothing but home invasions  I haven't noticed that  Well  There have been a lot  Of home invasions  What's a lot  A lot  Enough  Let me tell you something  Enough is a different word  How much  Let me say  Double figures  Probably  Probably a few a week  But who cares  Average is three a week  Let's even say 
[00:51:30]  It's one a week  I don't care  That's one too many  I don't want to be the guy  52 home invasions a year  Happen in Long Island  No there's probably more than that  I don't believe  But I'm not going to be the guy  Hey  Hey Ginger  If you  If your house got broken into  And you were ready to be attacked  What would you do  What's your like  Spontaneous plan  What would you do  Well I'd probably be attacked  Yeah  Okay  Yeah  So what's the dumb 
[00:52:00]  What's this dumb move I'm doing  By actually being prepared  Well I'm also being prepared  I mean I have nothing against guns  And you know in the home  The mania  It's just a little much  What is a little much  About being prepared  And fighting fire with fire  In that way  What you're saying  Is there a couple of hidden knives  Maybe  A butcher knife  I don't want to get into  A knife fight with somebody  In a lockbox  Why would I want to get into  A knife fight with somebody 
[00:52:30]  A small  And what am I going to lock  Guns up  So I have to say  Excuse me  Could you wait until I get a key  And open this  Before you shoot me  And rape my girlfriend  You want Anthony to get into  A Broadway production  With the home  Yeah  Da da da da da  Ba da da da  Da da da  Huh  Jets  When you're a jet  You're a jet  All the way from your first  What am I going to do  Dance  Dance and knife  Ginger  Night fight  You're  You're  Maybe  Maybe I'm taking it 
[00:53:00]  To extreme one way  But you're just being  Complacent  And you know  It could happen to anybody  Well you know  Because I don't  I think if someone  I just couldn't trust myself  That it wouldn't be  One of my kids  Or  Oh kids  Hold it  Hold it  Hold it  Hold it  Hold it  Let me  Now let me say this  If you have kids in the house  You absolutely can't do  What I'm doing  Okay  I understand that  That's your problem  Now you have kids  So you have to kind of  Sacrifice your own safety  Because you have children 
[00:53:30]  Because you can't have guns  Just laying around  Why don't you give her a protection plan  Instead of attacking her  Give her a protection plan  Because she's attacking me  She's not really attacking you  She's attacking me  She's bothered by you  She's bothered by me  For no reason  Other than I have made a plan  And I'm safe  She's kind of just bothered  By the radio show  But she can't help  But listen every day  I know  She had a problem  With the show yesterday  She had a problem  With the show today  Is she married?  You keep saying that  I don't have a problem  You thought we bored everybody  By talking about video games yesterday 
[00:54:00]  And we couldn't disagree more  Don't you think  If I listen every day  Once in a while  You might say something  That I might just not agree with?  Once in a while?  This is two days in a row  How could you not agree  With somebody just being  Safety conscious  As far as crime goes?  I don't think I agree  Or disagree  I just  All right  I just think it's too much  Wait  I do have one more thing  I just want to redeem myself  In Anthony's eyes  This is off the subject 
[00:54:30]  I am divorced  I do have children  And when I did get divorced  I asked for absolutely nothing  Oh  Now we love Ginger  There you go  So you turned  I just wanted to say that  I was married for over 10 years  I was at home with my kids  Where are you calling from?  Kenya?  I asked for not a penny  Kenya  She's in Kenya right now  Well do you have like  Your own money or something?  No  I went out and got a job  Did you get the house  And the deal?  Absolutely not  Yeah but what  You just turned a lot  She just turned around 
[00:55:00]  A lot of people right there  With that statement  She's old school  Well I knew that I was  Going to redeem myself with that  I didn't  There was no reason  Why I couldn't go out and work  And I did  And there was no reason  Why I would tear down  His house  I mean  I knew my kids  Would always have a  You know a safety net there  That I couldn't go out and work  And I did  How old are your children?  Now?  Yeah  15 and 12  Okay  I thought she came up  In a time where you can  Like punch a woman  But they wouldn't call a cop  Like the late 
[00:55:30]  God bless Ginger today  Alright Ginger  We'll see you next time  Alright?  Alright  Hopefully  If her home isn't invaded  And she isn't found choked  On a phone cord  I don't think she cares  I think if somebody choked  It'll turn around  She's finished  Let's go right to Frank in Boston  Frank you had a home invasion?  Yeah I was on the  Second floor  My parents were away  On vacation  This happened when I was  21  I'm 27 now  And I heard  Glass breaking  So  I automatically knew  Nobody was  Nobody that was supposed 
[00:56:00]  To be coming into the house  Was coming into the house  So I loaded up the shotgun  Just like you had  It was a 12 gauge slugs  I tiptoed down the stairs  And there's a  There's a doorway  On the right  And there's a hall there  And I knew that  They were in there  Because I could hear them  Going through the stuff  So I opened the door  They're basically  In alignment  I look at the guy  For a second  He didn't even hear  The door open  He just looks at me  And he almost  He almost says something  I pulled the trigger  Closed his chest  Right open  It's the other guy 
[00:56:30]  In the arm  And I was feeling  Real good right then  The other guy  I mean this guy's  Body's on the ground  Is making this weird noise  And I was feeling pumped  You know  And the other guy  Looks at me  And he just  He tries to turn around  And I get him too  Blows his chest open  It's the most disgusting  Thing I ever see  I've ever seen in my life  I felt really good  You know  I mean the cops came  And they were making  Me feel bad  But for the most part  I was feeling good  But now  You know  I just  This is the worst  Murder story I've ever  How can you make 
[00:57:00]  Blowing on people's chest  Ball  He's like  What part of Revere  Were you from  Yeah where did this happen  In Boston Frank  I don't want to say  Where this happened  But you don't feel  Like a man  After killing people  Especially as the years  Go on  You just feel worse  And worse  And I think  I'm just gonna  Do myself in any day  He's lying  I'm not buying it there  Yeah  Not even  9-11 was an inside job  See ya  And you can tell  That was the worst  I killed somebody's story  I've ever heard  I just said  I watched his chest blow up 
[00:57:30]  And I was feeling really good  Then the other guy's chest  Blew up  The other guy's chest  Blew up  And an alien came out  I don't want to tell you  What part of Revere  Let's go to the psychologist  Finally  It's Lydia from Oceanside  Lydia what's up  Hi guys  Hey  Yeah I wanted to let you know  That I am a clinical psychologist  With a master's degrees  And a PhD  And I love you guys  I went to see a comedy show  At Jones Beach 
[00:58:00]  But I have to say  Anthony  Yes  Therapy would do you  A world of good  Now why is that  Well I'm not saying  You're right  You know what you were saying  To Ginger  Is 100% correct  You have to be  Safety conscious  But what Patrice is saying  Makes a lot of sense  I think it's just a little  Over the edge  With you  I personally  It's taxi driver  I'm sorry  It's taxi driver  I'm not doing that  Right  Exactly 
[00:58:30]  Exactly  I personally think  It dates back  To that feeling  Of vulnerability  In the tree fort  That was sexy  Not vulnerable  I better know  That was sexy  For you Anthony  You know  I'm just being safe  Why  Why  Why is it  When someone wants  To be safe  And not be victimized  That they're crazy  You're preparing  This is why you're crazy  You're preparing 
[00:59:00]  For a  You have escalated  A paranoid delusion  To where you're prepared  For that paranoid delusion  You're not prepared  Safety is a seatbelt  Safety is  Put that cigarette out  Safety is  Imminent  But you're not  In the imminent danger  From a guy  Breaking in your home  But that's what people  Are never prepared for  Non-imminent danger  People are never prepared for it  And they are the worst 
[00:59:30]  Being a victim like that  Would be the worst  Life  Ruining  Devastating thing  That could happen to somebody  I want to know  Why she thinks you're crazy though  She's just touching  Oh thank you  Because Anthony  Anthony is prepared  And I agree with him  That you have to be  Safety conscious  I live in Nassau  I just said all that already  Why is Anthony crazy?  Because  He is  More than prepared  He's obsessed  No no  I'm just talking about it 
[01:00:00]  Here on the air  But it isn't  It isn't how I'd lead  But this is well thought out  Is what she's getting at  At some point  I thought it out  I think just about  Every person listening  But I don't lead my life  On a daily basis  Going through drills  And marching around  The house  With my guns  Actually you have to be  To prepare your woman  And your cat  I bet you he has  Rolled off his bed  A few times  I have never  First of all 
[01:00:30]  Never rolled off  What are you  58?  You're 58?  Jesus Christ  I'm not even close  To the 50  You have to practice  Some type of  Muscle memory  To slide a 58 year old  Body off the bed  To grab his gun  From out of the floor  Hey  Anthony's working out  These days  Did you see  You want to see the guns?  Let's see the guns  Look at the guns  Look at the guns  Thurston Howell  Had the same arms  On Gilligan's hour  Hey Gilligan's hour 
[01:01:00]  Look at the guns  Why guns?  Why small?  Why Anthony?  Why do you need  More than one gun?  Because there's  More than one room  He showed off  His muscles dearie  What am I going to say?  If they break in downstairs  I'm going to say  Could you excuse me  While I go upstairs  And get the gun  To shoot you with?  You've got to be prepared  But there's a  Okay  What is the lifestyle?  How many times a day?  Yeah  Do you think on that level?  Do you actually live your life? 
[01:01:30]  Oh no  There are days  Weeks go by  Where I don't even think about that  But if I'm asleep  And I hear something  I'll kind of lift my head up  I look around  And then I know  I go  Okay  The gun's there  If that sound develops  Into anything else  I know where everything is  So yeah  You're crazy  I'm with you  No but that doesn't happen  For like weeks  You're overthinking it  A little too much  No I'm not  Why  What are you crazy?  We're with you  On a certain level  You would be scared 
[01:02:00]  Crapless  If you were laying in bed  And heard a window break  Downstairs  And you hear some people  Go in  And then you'd be like  What do I do?  You'd be looking around  Grabbing a pencil  That your hopes are  Jabbing the guy's eye  But that's what  The average citizen would do  The average citizen  Is a victim  And an idiot  You know what  You're preparing for a war  Some weird war  No it's not a weird war  It's been called  A certain type of war  But that's the one  I'm preparing for  Sorry Patrice 
[01:02:30]  I can't believe you said  52 home evasions a year  That is ridiculous  Patrice  There's a lot  There's a lot out there  If there was one  This isn't one of these  Just every once in a while  If you look at the news  All you see  Are Nassau County police cars  With tape around a house  It's all the time  There will be tape  Around my house  But it'll be me out front  Giving the interview  Why don't you live  In the city?  The city  Doesn't allow you  To have guns  He needs guns 
[01:03:00]  Patrice  But you don't worry  About that at all  Right?  Because you live  In a building  Why don't you hire  A security guard?  I don't want a security guard  Have someone just  Walk the perimeter  Have someone called  An inside job  Just walk  Have someone  Walk the perimeter  Every now  Why have a security guard  When you have security cameras?  You can get Kenny  To walk the perimeter  Thank you  Hey Kenny  How much does it cost  To do  Security for a year?  Personal security  Your person's security guard  Not even  Or bodyguard 
[01:03:30]  Just overnight security  From let's say  6, 7 o'clock at night  To 6, 7 in the morning  The going rate  Is $50 an hour  That's it?  $50 an hour  And you can get  Someone walking  In that building  In front of the driveway  Right  And just $50 an hour  To sit in a car  Outside his place  And walk the perimeter  Every once in a while  There you go  So $600 a day?  Yeah  To be a sentry  That's nothing  Alright  Thank you  You're in a date  Your bullets cost more  Thank you guys 
[01:04:00]  Alright  Residential burglaries  1,093  In Nassau County  1,093 residential burglaries  Now that doesn't necessarily mean  Last year?  That people were home at the time  But I'm looking for  But home invasions  Home invasion  Most of the time  You gotta understand  Home invasion is a life sentence  Man  Most of the time  People are not trying to rob you  While you're at home  Cause they're going to jail  For the rest of their life  Yeah but if that door is open  If that you know 
[01:04:30]  That sliding door  Or a window is open  That's when you got trouble  I bet you you have  You invite  In some weird way  You invite a home invasion  Like  No  You got candy  Xboxes  I do not  He got something going on  He just  What I did  Most of the callers  Agree with Anthony  When strangers are in my house  Like the cleaning people  Or something  I will then go around  The entire house  And make sure  All my windows are locked  Cause I don't want somebody 
[01:05:00]  Going  Click  I'll leave that open  For later  See  So I'm not inviting  A home invasion  I make sure  I lock all the windows again  You're overthinking it  Just like Lydia said  No  What if  Let's go to Jimmy in Boston  Holy jeez  You're all victims  You're victims waiting to happen  Alright calm down  Sheep  I told you already  Calm down  I'm the wolf  Take a breath  Not the sheep  Take a breath  Okay  Jimmy in Boston  Listening on BCN  The home of  Toucher and Rich  What's up Jimmy  What's going on guys  Hey man  Hey I just wanted to  Toucher's home intoxication 
[01:05:30]  Which is almost like  Home invasion  Only drunk  Yeah he gets  He gets around situations  By just handing out  Beer to everybody  Let's just have a party  They just drink together  Let's just have a party  Everyone leaves happy  Right  Alright Jimmy  What do you got  Hey I was just thinking  I mean do you guys  Think it's crazy  The families that come up  With escape routes  And meeting places  They're in like  A home fire  Crazy  No that's fine  They're kind of just  Preparing for something 
[01:06:00]  That's not common  You know  How do you prepare  Your kids for negroes  Coming through your  Front door  And trying to kill you  Well your kids  Are very difficult  You don't want to  Turn them off  To you know  Different cultures  But somebody  As jaded as me  Who was brought up  In a predominantly  Racist household  Right  You know  It's had it's effect  On me  I just  You've never had  Any  You've never had  A black person  Let me tell you something  You've never had  A black person  Do anything wrong  To you ever 
[01:06:30]  That's changed your life  No no  That's  Never  That's not true  You've never had  A black person  I went to Central Islip  School district  Punching your stomach  I'm talking about  Traumatic dude  Like being stabbed  On this level  Where you're worried  About black people  Oh no  You know something  I want that to continue  Alright listen  Let me ask you this  Before we go to break  Yeah  Do you want a home invasion  To happen  He does  Thank you  Thank you  It would be the most  Frightening thing  And I think if I killed 
[01:07:00]  Somebody  I would  I would be  A changed person  It's not a good thing  To kill people  It would haunt you  You know  It would just haunt me  I don't want it  But I am not gonna  I think what's more traumatic  Than killing someone  That has invaded your home  Is sitting there  During those moments  Watching the horror  That is ensuing  As you and your loved ones  Are being tortured  Perhaps killed  And you are powerless 
[01:07:30]  That's the thing  Is being powerless  I am not gonna be  A victim  I will fight it out  Till the end  Till somebody's dead  That's how it's gotta work  Because I'm not gonna sit there  And then  Have it all end  And go through years  Of this  Of this  In his paranoia  It's  At the highest level  Because it doesn't even involve  Maybe not  Being killed  Maybe just being robbed  I don't wanna be robbed 
[01:08:00]  I don't want anyone  In my goddamn house  Of course  But if they get the beat on you  You gotta be thinking  Alright look  Just take this little bit of money  No  That would traumatize me  Worse than  Shooting somebody  Would be  Me  Getting strangled  Or pistol whipped  Getting my possessions  Taken in front of me  Having people just come  And then go  And they're gone  Having a great old time  After they just robbed me  And perhaps they're off  Robbing somebody else 
[01:08:30]  That would kill me  I couldn't live like that  I'd live better  Having shot somebody  It's to the death  It's to the death  That's what he said  To the death  It's to the death  Once he passes my doorway  To the death  Alright it's  The Opie and Anthony Show  Patrice O'Neill  What are we promoting today  Patrice  My website  My podcast  Patrice O'Neill dot com  Patrice O'Neill dot com  There you go  And that's my weekly podcast  Very fun  Alright  We're in the middle of  Makeup Stuff Tuesday  Rock Scream Tuesday

[01:24:30]  I thought  I thought  The sentence  Was going to be  I mean the obvious  Nursing a cocktail  Is pretty funny  But I thought  I was going to say  Nursing a  A sore seat  Oh can you imagine  I gotta read that again  Because that's just  That's just comedy people  We both get something  We want  Where's the negative  Ali asked  In a bar later  Nursing a cocktail  Greaves cook  And many hotel managers  Say they are doing 
[01:25:00]  All they can  To discourage  The practice  The head of a local  Hotel association  Told me they have  Begun taking measures  Like refusing guests  Who want to change  From a single  To a double room  Oh  Can you imagine  The choices  Old white woman  Or oats  Being thrown out  Of a helicopter  It's like  That's your choice  That's your choice  It's like  I'm with the rest  Of the tribe  Where I gotta catch  Giant bags of rice  Without water  Eat that  Eat that gruel  Out of that wooden bowl  Oh man 
[01:25:30]  Or just  Or eat that gruel  Or eat that gruel  Out of a dry wooden bowl  You gotta  You gotta think  This is a no brainer man  You're right  Either way  Oh man  It's probably  Like an alligator's stomach  Either way  It's gonna leave  A bad taste in your mouth  Yeah  Oh man  Those poor African men  Why couldn't it just  Why couldn't  See this is what I'm saying  If I was a woman man  I would  Sell my body  Until no one wanted me  Like 
[01:26:00]  Why do you have to have  See what a waste of time  Dignity is  Is that these women  Now go  Why didn't I  Enjoy sex  My whole life  Now I have to go to Africa  Risk AIDS  Risk  Like  Getting attacked by something  Yeah  Get eaten by a lion  A lion  To have sports sex  Right  Yeah  Women now  Like women 20 to 40  Or whatever  They're just  Dignity  Integrity  And now it's like  It's these women  Flying from wherever  They're from  Probably the queen  Of England too  She flies over there 
[01:26:30]  Pretending this  I'm on a diplomatic mission  Trying to get some  From Forest Whitaker  You gotta avoid lions  And angry giraffes  To get to the Kenya  I mean  That don't make  You see what  Integrity does for you ladies  You end up being  A 70 year old woman  Flying over  Sleeping with  Flying over to Kenya  It's a fine line  We're 100%  Against anything illegal  Such as prostitution  But it's different  With something like this  It's just unwholesome  Unwholesome  These beaches have been  Long been notorious  For attracting  Another type of sex tourist 
[01:27:00]  Men who abuse children  One type of sex tourist  Attracted the other  Said one manager  At a bar  Blah blah blah  Blah blah  Alright  Cougars  Going after the Kenya men  Here  One club  A group of about  25 dancing men  Edged closer and closer  To a crowd of more  Than a dozen white women  I didn't come here  Looking for a husband  Bethan said  It's a social arrangement  I buy him a nice shirt  And we go out for dinner  His shirt  For as long as he stays with me  He doesn't pay for anything  And I get what I want  A good time  How's that different  From a man buying  A young girl dinner 
[01:27:30]  Yeah  There you go  It's only fair  But see here's the difference  We start out wanting  To do that at 15  And we quit at 60  Now you're starting  At 60  You're a wrinkled mess  Going to Africa  Let's go to Robin  She's in Oklahoma  Robin  You're a cougar  Robin  Robin  Hey Robin  Oklahoma  Cougar  42 years old  Say hi  Gone  No 
[01:28:00]  Alright let's say hi  To Allison in Jersey  Allison  What's up  Wait a minute  Hi  Robin and Allison  Hey Allison  How are you  Good how are you  You're 31 years old  And you consider yourself  An old cougar  Not an old cougar  But  Well it says  Used to be a cougar  You're 31 years old  When were you  Cougaring  Just a couple years ago  I was married  And it was a  Pretty boring marriage  So when I got out of it  I just needed something  Fresh and new  So I was dating  A 20 year old 
[01:28:30]  So  There was almost  A 10 year age difference  Now did you  Did you wish you didn't  Waste all that time  With integrity  All those years  Oh yeah  Cause I was with  My  She's 31 years old  She's still young  No she's not  That's old  I've always been  Hey I'm not old  Yeah you're old  You're pretty old  In the game  You're pretty old  31  31 is old  What is wrong with you  20 to  I thought we were talking  Like a 40 something  Or whatever  31 is not old  Reports coming in  Saying she's a milf  Not a cougar 
[01:29:00]  Yeah  Milf  If you're a mom  Are you a mom  I am a mom now  I'd say you'd be a milf  Now you're more  In the milf category  She's a mooger  Mooger  I think you gotta be  When does the cougar age start  35  40  40  I'd say depending on  The age of the guy  That they're going for  Probably would start at 40  You know if you're 40  And you're going for a guy  In his 30s  It's not really cougaring  What if it's a 35  Girl 
[01:29:30]  21 year old guy  More milfish  Milfish  Yeah  I think  I think once they get 40  Then you're cougaring  If you're going for a guy  In his 20s  If you wasted  There's a lot of  Extenuating circumstances  There's some  40 year old  Really hot women  Who aren't cougars  They're still sexual entities  Yeah  This lady wasted her time  With the marriage  And the kids  And the this and the that  Right  There was a time frame  Where she should have been  Living her life  Now she's living it  I think she is a cougar 
[01:30:00]  Because she's living  She missed out on a thing  You know what I mean  She missed out on something  Alright let's uh  Thank you Allison  We're going to go back to Robin  She's 42 years old  Uh Robin you there finally  Yeah I'm sorry about that guys  Alright so  I'm 40  Go ahead  No go  Oh I'm 42  I've been married for a year now  But I love younger men  I wasted 10 years in a marriage  A sexless marriage  And when I got a divorce  That's screw it 
[01:30:30]  I'm going after the younger guys  And it can't be beat  I recommend it to women  I don't  I you know  There's better answers for men  Can I ask you a quick question miss  Quick question  Why didn't you have all the sex  With the guys  Who wanted to have all the sex  With you at a certain time  Why is it when you  When you missed the  The  To the thing where your husband  Wasn't horny  Like he was when he was younger  Now he doesn't want to sleep with you  But now you're over sex  Why didn't you just want to sleep  With the guy  When he wanted to sleep with you 
[01:31:00]  Why don't women sleep with guys  When they're 20 and hot  Instead of these wrinkled up messes  Flying to Africa  Because I was a virgin  When I got married  I bought into that crap  And I was married for a long time  And my husband  He was just  He never was real sexual  You know  I always was  And I missed it  And then when we got a divorce  I said  She just went wild  Yeah she went nuts  So where'd you  Where'd you pick up the guys  I barked in it for years  So that's all I had to do 
[01:31:30]  If I wanted a guy  I had one right there man  And then you know  On the other side  If I wanted to  Buy drinks  I mean I'm married now  To someone 10 years younger than me  And I  I did it for a while  I wouldn't want long term  But you know  It's worth it  Where else are we  Can I warn you about something  Real quick  In another 5 years  You'll be wondering  Why this guy  Doesn't sleep with you either  It doesn't change  It's not that you're not sexy  He's just gonna get tired of you  We need different  Yeah but good is good  As long as you can get it man 
[01:32:00]  And I'll sit there  You know  Hey Robin  Would you consider  Going to Kenya  To get some young  Some young  You know what  I think if you have to go to Kenya  That's the  That's the real desperate cougars  That's the  Oh yeah  That's the mangy cougars  You would have no luck  In the sports bars of America  So they're like  Oh man  Our last hope is to go to Kenya  Go to Kenya  And risk HIV  Is it with a white guy  Robin  Yes I'm married to a white guy 
[01:32:30]  Have you ever  Have you ever  Tested a little  A Maasai Louisville slugger  No no  Not interested huh  No no  Not interested in a baby arm  Excuse me  Not interested in a  In a negro baby arm  Oh no  I think that would be  A little too much  So no  No Kenya for me  Okay  Alright thank you  Alrighty bye  Alright  Let's go to Jay  In Massachusetts  Jay what's up 
[01:33:00]  Hey what's going on guys  Hey man  Yeah I just broke up  With a cougar man  I'm actually out  On my ass now  I lived in her house  For about a year and a half  Wait wait  We laughed over that  Lived in her house  For a year and a half  Rent free right  Oh yeah  She got me a car  You know  It was nice  She's good looking too man  Viagra my man  Viagra  No it's hilarious  We  Usually when we go down  This road  We talk to the cougars  Maybe the bit is  To talk to the guys 
[01:33:30]  That got dumped by cougars  Yeah  When they were living  The high life man  And he stopped  He stopped slinging it  He stopped slinging it  I bet you Jay  That you were still  Banging other broads  Behind her back  Younger  She's probably listening  Yeah  She likes you guys  I mean we're still friends  We just broke up recently  But it sucks man  I'm homeless right now  So you were getting  Something out of it as well  Free rent  Free dinners  Gifts  It don't work out  Everything  It was five star restaurants 
[01:34:00]  All day long  It was great  She was loaded  She's a CFO  So one day you got comfortable  And just walked around the house  And didn't do your job  Is that correct?  Yeah I probably should have  Got down on my knees  A little bit more  You know  I'm down and out now man  It's bad  I'm missing her  She's the exact same age  As my mother  They got along great  Oh god  That's hilarious  We got another guy  That got dumped  Thanks man  Let's say hi to Dave 
[01:34:30]  In New York  Dave what's up?  Hey what's up guys  Hey  Hey yeah I was a victim  Of a cougar too  I was 28  And she was 52  Cougar attack  52  Yeah but she was hot man  She had the implants  Going and everything  So  What a pacemaker?  Implant?  You know  You gotta ask the question  Right  Ask him what  52 year old  Is like  Yeah  Yeah yeah  How do you describe  What it's like?  There's like a difference  There's gotta be a difference 
[01:35:00]  Between  22  And 52  As far as  Let's just  Vaguely say  The feeling  Goes  There is a mush factor  I call it  The mush factor  Oh  Yeah  What's that?  Oh  Well as you know  It's not quite as firm  As a 22 year old  And  Oh  Okay so you're saying  The skin's a little looser 
[01:35:30]  So things are  Yeah things are a little  Like  Shaky  A little  Looser  And  It's like a turducken  Kind of  You know  The mush factor  You don't want to deal  With the mush factor  Jesus  I never heard that before  No  Yeah  We need t-shirts  I've dealt with the mush factor  Yeah  It's kind of tough  The turducken was a great example  Because one time  I walked into the bathroom 
[01:36:00]  When she was showering  And then what I saw  From behind  You know  It was kind of like  A little droopy  You asked her why  She brought her luggage  Into the shower  It's like  Nicholson walking into  The hotel room  In The Shining  The woman in the tub  When did we get a baby  When did we get a baby elephant  As a pet  Right  Why are you washing your bat  Inside the shower  Your bat  I didn't know you had a pet bat 
[01:36:30]  So  Why did the relationship end there?  Well  Her kids didn't appreciate that  I was  Younger than her  Youngest child  That's never good  And you were living with her  And all that?  No  No  I wasn't living with her  I didn't quite make that jump  After a few times  In the mush factor  It kind of settled in  Unbelievable  My goodness  Now was she the best 
[01:37:00]  Was she the best you ever had?  No she wasn't  But from the neck up  She was beautiful  But was anything  From the neck up  Was anything she did  The best you ever had?  Like  Was any  Did she have any tricks  That some young bra  Just didn't do?  Um  No  I think she was a little repressed  But not really  No  So nothing  Alright  Nothing  I think  I think  No  I was hoping for some circus tricks  But nothing  I think she was  Worried about the age factor too 
[01:37:30]  No problem  Alright thank you Dave  Alright guys  Have a great day  We gotta take a break  We got so many guys on hold  19  35 year old  I'm 24  My girl's 45  Hate it  But I get money  The calls are coming in  Like crazy  We'll continue in just a bit  It's Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  On your radio dial  Take it to the people  Oh boy

[01:39:30]  There is nothing  Itty bitty about that scar  Really okay  Continue  But the problem was  That when I met her  She had  She had just  Gone through breast cancer  And to do it  With that  With someone  Who has  Two mastectomy scars  With  Down there  But the money  Is pretty good  How poor are you  I don't have to  Pay for anything  I mean  I get  You know  I get like  You know  An allowance  Quote unquote  But I do have access

[01:55:00]  What  Oh jeez  What do you got  A long dress  And witch shoes  And  No no no  What do you dress like  Lizzie Borden  Why don't you just  Why don't you just  Have kids and throw them  In the bathtub  And go to jail  Hey she believes  In love Patrice  Oh jeez  What's that woman be  You're too old  You know why  Should she have settled  There's a lot of people  Out there  They get a little older  And they just settle  And say  It's not gonna get  Better than this  I'm not in love  With this person  We're gonna  Oh you  I got  I was trying to 
[01:55:30]  Defend you  I got two words  For you sweetie  Tick tock  No it's not  Tick tock  Don't you  It's not  It's not  You don't think  You'll ever be in diapers  No I will  But here's the thing  Here's the difference  Between you and us  One is that  There will be a woman  Who will love me enough  To walk around  With my diapers  Cause I'm a guy  You're gonna have trouble  Finding a guy  That's gonna do that  For you  I'm gonna take my diapers  You gotta start  Giving it up  Why would you 
[01:56:00]  Hold on to  45 year old  Goods  42  42  That's like  That's like  Having unfrozen meat  Sitting around  On the counter  For five years  First of all  Be respectful  Be nice  No no no  This is respectful  I'm being respectful  You know what show you called  Here's the thing  This is why  You're not finding love  Listen to you  You don't give it up  You're a  You just  You sound like  A giant parrot  This is  This is the problem  You're not  You're not in a 
[01:56:30]  Bargaining chip  Let me tell you  Your value  The value  The value  Of women  Listen  The value  Of women  Is like cars  It ain't like houses  I should explain  That's a horrible statement  Because  Are you married?  Annie  Hold on  Let me jump in here  Annie  I gotta explain  That Patrice  Looks at relationships  A bit different  Than almost  90% of the people  Out there  That got bored  With their husbands  Why get married?  I never married  Because  I wanted to be  With someone  And you sound so happy 
[01:57:00]  And you  And forever  Wait wait wait  She still has hope  In her heart  Hope?  She still has hope  Hope and no plans  I'm actually with this one  Boy I hope I get rich  Hold on  I respect what she's saying  Because there's a lot of people  That get married  And go ah  Time to get married  And they settle  She's not saying that though  She's still hoping  To find someone  Around her age  That she can fall in love  With and marry  What is she screeching about though?  Exactly  Let me hear what she's screeching about  She's screeching  Because  What do you have to say? 
[01:57:30]  She said a tax  And she called the radio  Show  Wait what do you have to say?  Let her have her piece here  What do you say?  Women have to be respectable  And be  And not  Run around and say  Look I got bored  Of my husband  After a year  So that is  Disgusting  And ridiculous  And they're not cougars  They're just idiots  Because marriage  Is about being forever  I mean  It's supposed to be  Till death  And you guys  Have so much power  In your hands  You can change  The minds of people  And tell them  Listen  30 years ago  It was forever 
[01:58:00]  Why within 30 years  It's changed  And it's been for a year  Oh I'm bored  Because he doesn't get me off  I mean that's horrible  It's totally  It's not even human  So God bless you guys  And I hope you wake  Some people up  To the right way  And to marry forever  Oh boy  Marry forever  That's why I did not marry  And those are  Oh boy oh boy  And that's why  I did not marry  What part of Pennsylvania  You live in  Marry should be forever  Or Utah  Which part of Utah  Do you live in  Utah  You don't live  Where regular people live  I've been raised  In New York City 
[01:58:30]  No way  No way  Where do you live now  New Amsterdam  This is worldwide  Okay  It's worldwide  Look at the Muslims  We have our enemies  Our enemies  Not our enemies  We can't  They cover everything up  Whoever they are  Who knows  We were right  Our enemies  Look at the Muslims  They stay together forever  In the world market  Alright  So we should start  Beating our women  With sticks  And victimizing  Rape victims 
[01:59:00]  And arresting them  Are you insane  Were you just trying  To equate  Muslim marriages  To our own  The fact that  They stay together  They stay together  Because if the woman  Leaves  She gets killed  No not at all  What I'm trying to say  How many cats  Do you own  Their families  Will hold till the end  Crazy cat lady  Because they don't  Believe in  I'm not Catholic  I'm a Greek Orthodox  No how many cats  Do you own  Their families  Will hold till the end  Because they don't  Believe  I don't think  They believe in  They do other 
[01:59:30]  Horrible things  They marry many women  So I won't even  Go into that  They don't believe  In divorce  No  Like the woman  Just gets killed  Okay  If she leaves  Or looks at another guy  You're talking about  A savage way of life  Have you ever had  A relationship man  Of course  When  Years ago  Years ago  Years ago  What happened  Something bad  Happened in your relationship  What happened  She's not well  Why  How did the relationship end  It sounds like it didn't end  Well whatsoever

[02:04:00]  Oh  Yeah yeah  Okay  Definitely Kathy Bates  What's the movie with Kathy Bates  Claire  Claire  That's who this woman is  Liz Claiborne  Liz Claiborne  Liz Claiborne  Exactly  I know what you  Sounds like Liz Claiborne  Kathy Bates  Let me tell you something  Dolores Claiborne  Dolores Claiborne  That's this woman  I like Annie  I don't dislike Annie  But she's Dolores Claiborne  She doesn't want to go to Kenya  For young black male 
[02:04:30]  She thinks  Are you nuts  If she gets a hold of you  She's going to break your ankles  With a hammer  What is she doing though  On the dates  If she hasn't had sex  In five years  At first we used to go  I used to  You know  They wanted to take me  And I said  No no  We're going to go for  Either coffee or tea  I don't want you spending money  Because then  It turns out  They spend money  Then you owe them something  Oh this one guy  This one guy  He didn't even want to pay  For the dinner  And I'm from a generation  And then I realized  Look  It's only a right 
[02:05:00]  To go 50-50  You know  I mean  I don't know these people  They want to take you  You know what  If a guy  Isn't willing to pay  For dinner  Or he wants to go  50-50  Run  No no  She doesn't  She doesn't want  The guy to pay  Because then  She's obligated  Oh really  She owes them something  He had to be a gentleman  You know  He should have been a gentleman  What are you looking for  In these dates  I'm looking for  A long term relationship  Leading for marriage  What else  Holy mother of god  How are you going to do that 
[02:05:30]  When these guys  Are just out  Trying to get some  Yeah but maybe  She runs into one  That isn't  I don't know  It happens all the time  It's a race  To who kills who  She's probably just  Cut this short okay  She's probably ugly  Oh  Jesus  I used to do stand-up  In New York  Anyway I'm not going  To even say  She looks  She's Kathy Bates  No  I don't look like  Kathy Bates  Okay  I kind of like her  I used to be  With a modeling agency  So I'm not  I'm not bad  Oh you did  So she's just  Some crazy 
[02:06:00]  Good looking broad  Look she's got  She's got hopes  And she's got dreams  What's wrong with that  I kind of like Annie  I just want to find  A nice  But it's scary  That you've had  50 dates  In the last year  50 dates  And change his diapers  One day  You know  I mean that's not  A bad thing to want  God  That's right  Because if you love  Someone  Let's say  Look you marry someone  And one year  He like loses it  It's gone  He can't anymore  What are you going to do  Leave him  Oh the sex isn't good anymore  Too badly  You can stay with him 
[02:06:30]  You can stay with him  But you can get some side  No it's not about sex  I think  I think sex is really important  To a relationship  Not to her  I don't think so  And these women  These young women  Especially for the first  20 or 30 years  Now I'm really going to  Try to say this  The right way  Annie have you had  An orgasm  In the last  Five years  This young lady  That called earlier  And said she left  Her husband  Because she married  She's a virgin

[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  It's Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  Hello. 
[02:19:00]  Patrice O'Neill.  Hello, sir.  So what do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  You want to do some Wolper and Schmitty or what?  Oh, that was so fun yesterday.  You think I forgot?  I didn't forget.  That was really fun yesterday.  I should, we should explain to Patrice.  Patrice, which one is he using?  This one?  You.  Oh, wow.  Look, okay.  All right.  I got you.  Recently, we got kicked off West Palm Beach Radio. 
[02:19:30]  West Palm Beach, Florida radio.  Asked never to return.  Asked never to return.  And it happens.  You know, you syndicate a radio show, you're going to win some, you're going to lose some.  Right.  And we lost West Palm Beach, Florida.  The PD down there in general wasn't into our thing.  Excuse the squeak.  He was not really into us.  He wanted a local show that kind of fit the image of the station, which, you know. 
[02:20:00]  Captured the flavor.  They rock.  They're an alternate rock type station.  And so we got replaced.  And as much as it frustrates me, I do understand to a point, you know, if it's a show where you  look at the show and you go, all right.  Not happy, but all right.  I can see what he's thinking.  They should do well with that show, or I can understand it's a business decision kind  of a thing.  Yeah.  One of those deals.  Right.  Well, we got replaced by this show called Loper and Schmitty, where he talks about his awesome 
[02:20:30]  kids.  I got awesome kids.  They pop lope-wizers.  You want a lope-wizer?  Because his name is Loper.  So he calls it a lope-wizer, and he just makes this sound effect of...  It's beyond awful.  Here, here's your lope-wizer.  There you go, Patrice.  Enjoy.  There's your lope-wizer.  Oh, yeah.  Isn't that great?  Great radio? 
[02:21:00]  And we basically got replaced by hacks.  So...  One hack and an intern.  And an intern.  A hack and an intern.  That's what replaced the great Opie Anthony show.  There you go.  There you have it.  And we like to tell people that it's a virus spreading.  Yeah, well...  Yeah.  This virus was cured with a little NyQuil.  I think they found a cure.  And a good night's sleep.  That's all it took.  I think the fever broke.  Yeah, the fever broke. 
[02:21:30]  The little...  I was running at 100 degrees, and it felt better.  Back down to 98.6.  I think I might be able to go to work tomorrow.  So, we played some of their audio yesterday, Patrice, and all the fans just ate it up.  Loved it.  They love the Loper and Schmitty stuff.  Who wouldn't?  All right.  Well, we start with more audio.  Thank God.  I couldn't get enough yesterday. 
[02:22:00]  Sam's all excited.  No, it sucks.  Yeah, good stuff.  Glad the TV shows I watch aren't 25 minutes late starting.  Dude, we were in an intense meeting at the other joint.  We had a little chit-chat.  I love that they think we're just kind of like...  We're shopping on the walkover.  Hey, that's a nice watch.  Let's watch.  Just like twiddling our thumbs.  Yeah.  Talking to the magazine stand guy.  What do you think we're doing?  I would like people to think logically. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  That's what I try to do.  Now, think logically.  Why would we want to just sit around and waste time?  Yeah, and not...  Wouldn't it be a lot easier to just turn the mics on and go?  Keep the energy going and all that.  Keep the flow going.  So, if we come in here 20 minutes after 9, don't you think there's a pretty good reason?  There was a reason.  It's not because then I decided to hit a diner.  Give us a little credit.  Just a tad.  Just think logically at times, and then you don't have to, like, bitch as much. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  It's so much easier to go from one show to the other immediately and continue the flow and the energy.  All right.  Loper and Schmitty, this is how they started their show to replace us yesterday.  Yes, this is the first...  We missed the first half hour yesterday, so we went...  E-Rock luckily taped it at home.  Thank God for the E-Rock.  Yeah, so we got...  They did, like, a pre-produced minute limerick type of thing.  Okay.  Oh.  And they kind of bashed everybody that had come within the last several years on the buzz. 
[02:23:30]  And you know what I love about this?  Sam is taking this assignment very seriously.  You got...  We got, like, 20 tracks in front of me.  Oh, Sam.  You said we needed more.  Never enough of these two.  Is there gold in here or what?  I think they're starting to hit their stride.  Okay.  All right.  Here's their pre-produced intro.  They started with yesterday.  Okay.  You see, for those who don't know me, my name is Johnny.  A guy who loves booze.  Hot chicks that are horny.  From 1995 to 2004, I hung here with Fatty, the lush and his whores. 
[02:24:00]  But something went wrong in the heart of New York when they gave too much power to a balding corporate dork.  Then, without warning, the plug was yanked.  And before you knew it, the morning buzz was tanked.  They said syndication will bring you success.  But all that it brought us were complaints and a mess.  They force-fed us, a 6'5 Jew.  But shortly thereafter, off the satellite, he flew.  30 days later.  All right.  Can I tell you something, you fucking cocks?  And, you know, and we're pretty honest on this show. 
[02:24:30]  Fucking Howard gave this station huge ratings, you fucking douches.  Yeah, at least be honest.  Be fucking honest.  We are.  Howard had great success down there and then went to satellite.  Off the satellite, he flew.  30 days later.  Here comes David Lee, a washed-up rock star with the brain of a pea.  Lucky for us, his stay was cut short when they realized his talent rivaled genital warts.  And then in an effort, some stay was last ditch. 
[02:25:00]  They signed O&A in their comic midget bitch.  Although the show was at times quite mannish, we knew for sure.  If we kept it, we were sure to flip Spanish.  So now here we are, back in our fair city, with a new morning buzz.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Loper and Smitty.  The Morning Buzz with Loper and Smitty.  103.1, The Buzz.  So now that they have officially made fun of us, I just have one word to say.  Yeah.  And that would be attack.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the first volley has been launched by them. 
[02:25:30]  All right.  All right.  If we had no listeners, enjoy our no listeners in the coming months.  Enjoy how we had no listeners and how they will crucify you.  And the station was going to go Spanish if we continued.  Oh, really?  How about you look at the last ratings?  Yeah.  Look at the ratings that now you have to do better than. 
[02:26:00]  Could they have been better?  Yes.  Were we doing okay?  Yes.  We were doing more than okay.  Were they going up, up, up?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Ah, please.  This is the business we're part of.  Wonderful.  And then they went into this, their Wake and Bake Trivia question.  Yeah.  Wake and Bake Trivia.  I highlighted today because we don't have the whole Wake and Bake Trivia, but this question  was just such a, they do it at like 6.15. 
[02:26:30]  So it's the first bit of the brand new show and the trivia question that they chose, it was  one to remember.  Mm-hmm.  Ah, let's say hi to Vinny and Poughkeepsie.  Vinny!  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, Vinny.  How you doing?  What's up?  Those fucking fairies got the nerve to call Norton a bitch when he's talking about his  little fairy wiping kids.  Exactly.  Yeah, well, there you go.  There he is talking about his fucking, who gives a shit wife and kids. 
[02:27:00]  Really?  That's another, that's a prime example of a self-important little cunt who,  thinks that anyone gives a shit about your wife and fucking kids.  No one cares.  If you're in the market for 20 fucking years, perhaps somebody might want to know what your  life is about.  Your first day on the air, you're talking about how awesome your wife and kids are.  Let me give you a little advice that might help your show out.  No one gives a fuck. 
[02:27:30]  No one cares about your dopey wife or stupid kids.  You gotta do that in very small doses.  Oh, very small doses.  And at the beginning, in none doses.  I'm kind of bummed Norton's not here so he could discuss how they called him a little  bitch.  Yeah.  There you go.  Please.  All right, Vinny.  Thank you.  Dan in Utah, you have something about us being late today?  Yeah, I do.  All right, go ahead.  All right. 
[02:28:00]  All right, he got us.  F yourself.  No, that was me.  Okay.  First ever Wake and Bake trivia question.  Here we go.  It is time for a new segment here on The Buzz.  It is called Wake and Bake Trivia.  It is your new hosts of The Morning Buzz, Loper and Smitty.  Yes, Jeremy Loper and Smitty Balls, a.k.a.  the artist formerly known as Whisker Biscuit.  It is good to be home.  Do you understand the outrage we're feeling, Patrice? 
[02:28:30]  What?  It's just what we, we have to sit here.  I'm going down slow right now, dude.  Isn't it just, this is, we have to, this is the business we're in.  We got replaced by this.  This.  A.k.a.  the artist formerly known as Whisker Biscuit.  It is good to be home, my friend.  It is good to be home.  I don't want to be replaced by Whisket Biscuit.  Whisket Biscuit. 
[02:29:00]  Whisket Biscuit.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Well, it just seems, it just seems like.  Whisker Biscuit.  They're following the rules, man.  They're following the rhythm.  They, they're kind of enjoyable right now.  Like, actually, let me listen to the chair, Tommy.  All right.  Let's go to Oliver in Texas.  Oliver.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey.  Thank you.  Hey, I was listening to that poem, and I kind of made up one on the spot.  I don't know how good it is, but here it goes.  All right.  It goes, Loper and Smitty, they are quite shitty.  Walking around thinking their show's very witty.  They walk around thinking they're very smart and thinking their jokes come with a knock. 
[02:29:30]  But when they open up their mouth, hey, here comes a cock.  That's not bad.  The guy only had a minute to come up on the spot.  I give you credit for that.  All right.  Let's get back to the, the whisker biscuit.  It, it is good to be home, my friend.  It is good to be home.  And, uh, unlike the past two years, you can actually win things now in the morning.  Yeah.  So, uh, we have a morning buzz, uh, prize pack.  Boy, is that another shot at us?  I guess so.  Was that a shot at us? 
[02:30:00]  Sloper and Smitty, you dopes.  You weren't giving away prize packs.  Uh-oh.  See, that's, that's, that's going to get the ratings, uh, flying.  Giving away Linkin Park fucking CDs is going to get the ratings up.  Was that another shot?  What?  Fuck.  Well, this business fucking blows.  Yeah.  Two years, you can actually win things now in the morning.  Wow.  So, uh, we have a morning buzz prize pack.  It's been a long time since the morning buzz prize pack is back. 
[02:30:30]  And, uh, if you could score today's wake and make trivia question, we will set you up.  So, uh, without any further ado, Mr. Smitty Balls, if you will, uh, sir, give us our wake  and make trivia question.  Smitty Balls?  Yeah.  What is that?  I think it's a takeoff on, like, sweaty balls.  Like, you got Smitty Balls.  What a douche.  Fuck.  Fuck. 
[02:31:00]  Prize packs.  They're proud that they can give away prize packs in the morning.  That's what they're doing.  Does anyone else feel my pain?  That's all I need to know.  They're bragging about the fact that they can give away prize packs, that they play music  in the morning.  Yeah.  Less talking.  And they could, like, give people lope wisers.  Oh, my God.  And Smitty Balls is with them. 
[02:31:30]  Who used to be Whiskit Biscuit.  Whiskit Biscuit.  That's his name now.  Whiskit Biscuit.  Smitty Balls.  God.  Smitty Balls, if you will, uh, sir, give us our wake and make trivia question.  The category.  Lighthouses.  I love lighthouses.  Lighthouses are the best.  Lighthouses.  Holy mother of fucking cock.  Are you shitting me?  Lighthouses are the best.  I love lighthouses.  What are you, a merchant marine? 
[02:32:00]  What, do you love semen, you fag?  I love lighthouses.  I want to make lighthouse movies.  If this isn't enough ammo for the pests to attack.  Are they doing lighthouse trivia?  Yes.  Did we get replaced by lighthouse trivia?  Dude, this is the shit we should have been doing.  Lighthouse trivia.  Lighthouse trivia.  Oh, my God. 
[02:32:30]  Lighthouse trivia.  I want to see if I can answer this.  Do you have the question?  Oh, thank you.  It's our wake and make trivia question.  The category.  Lighthouses.  I love lighthouses.  Lighthouses are the best.  Lighthouses rule.  This is the question, people.  All right.  What U.S. state has more lighthouses than any other U.S. state?  All right.  Stop it.  All right.  I got the state.  All right.  The state of who gives a shit? 
[02:33:00]  Holy mother, you got to be kidding me.  I'm going to go with Nevada.  Nevada.  At least that would make for funny radio.  I'm going to say Nevada.  Get it?  We need something with a very long, rickety, rocky coastline.  I am going to say Virginia. 
[02:33:30]  Have you lost your mind?  Lighthouses rule.  They're the best.  Five, six, one, five, five, five, oh, nine, nine, one, oh, three.  I'm going to go with Maine. 
[02:34:00]  Maine?  That's stupid.  You're crazy.  I'm going to go with...  Aren't you a lighthouse fan?  I'm going to go with...  I'm going to go with the state of who gives a shit?  Right?  Who gives a shit?  More lighthouses than any other U.S. state.  Jefferson to music.  It's a staple.  All right.  I'll give you a hint right off the bat. 
[02:34:30]  It is not Iowa.  It's not Iowa?  Not Iowa.  So you got 49 to choose from.  That's fucking funny because...  See, that's my Nevada joke, but he's a different...  You got the answer.  Oh, you got the answer.  Well, right now they're not taking live calls because they're in the middle of doing 90s at nine.  Fucking losers.  That's great.  All right.  That was a hint. 
[02:35:00]  All right.  I'll give you a hint right off the bat.  It is not Iowa.  It's not Iowa?  Not Iowa.  So you got 49 to choose from.  We are looking for the U.S. state with more lighthouses than any other U.S. state.  If you can get the answer correct, we will hook you up with a Morning Buzz prize pack.  Do you really want to...  Florida?  Well, people need to know.  Donna wants to know.  I mean, in the age of Google, this is really...  Yeah, contests like this is stupid.  You could just punch it up and sound like a genius.  It took 20 seconds, and I got Michigan. 
[02:35:30]  It's Michigan?  Followed closely with 90.  Yeah.  Followed closely by Maine with 80.  Oh.  And you guys laughed at Maine.  That was a good guess.  Thank you.  That was a good guess.  Jesus.  They have lighthouses and mooses.  Moosen.  Where does the state of who gives a shit fall on the list?  Because I thought that was number one.  It actually has 110.  Who gives a shit?  Actually, 250 million people.  Well, that was day one.  That wraps up day one.  We played a lot of the day one clips yesterday. 
[02:36:00]  We are now up to day two.  All right.  With the show that replaced us in West Palm Beach, Florida.  Here's their intro.  Oh, it's wacky.  All right.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I can't.  I can't.  What's with the wacky music and the clapping?  Patrice, go over there.  Those chairs are much better. 
[02:36:30]  Is this radio?  Huh?  Well, what's in my...  Oh, Patrice is falling out.  Well, he had a burger at three in the morning.  I remember you said that.  Yeah, but I'm not shutting down.  This thing is...  I'm not shutting down.  I'm just...  Yeah.  Well...  It's awful.  All right, let's listen.  It's awful.  Wow.  Maybe we're just...  Bitter?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Let's listen with an open mind.  All right, open mind.  All right, hold it.  Hold it.  That's what they would say.  They're just bitter.  Let me get the mood here. 
[02:37:00]  Did they give you all a reason?  Like, what's the reason they said?  They never talked to us.  No, they never really told us anything.  That's another great thing that happens in this business.  You just, like, stop communicating, even though it's the communication business.  Yeah.  We're in communications.  Except with people you have to communicate with.  Right.  And then they decide not to communicate.  All right.  All right.  Let's all picture we're in our cars.  We're driving to work.  All right.  You turn on the radio.  We're waiting for your favorite show.  No jealousy.  No bitterness. 
[02:37:30]  And here's what comes on.  I'm honestly...  I'm driving.  I want to know exactly...  I want to feel this...  Okay.  ...like I would not knowing that they're the show that replaced us.  It's nothing like that.  It's just a radio show.  All right.  I'm going to give a little dead air.  So let's just make believe you're turning on the radio for the first time.  And that's what you hear.  All right.  Here comes the dead air.  Here it is.  And here's you getting ready to turn on the radio station.  All right.  What the hell is going on? 
[02:38:00]  It's the Morning Buzz with Jeremy Loper and Smitty here on 103.1 The Buzz.  Florida's new rock alternative.  Welcome to day number two.  I am so glad day number one is over.  It's always like, you know, that nerve-wracking show.  Now that's all behind us, and it is time to rock. 
[02:38:30]  This replaced us.  Seriously.  This is college radio.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, no.  This is college radio shit.  Oh, I got to go with the fantasy of the...  Oh, I'm sorry.  No.  I ran my car into a pole and killed myself.  See, what our fine listeners don't understand fully is the fact that behind the scenes, especially  myself, and certainly Anthony as well, we're taking a lot of phone calls from people, and 
[02:39:00]  they told us this was coming, that we were going to be replaced in West Palm Beach, Florida.  Lots of calls.  So you're sitting there like, fuck, man, they must have like a fucking power hitter coming  back into the market that's like one of these one-market sensations that you just can't compete  against.  Frustrating, but shit.  Lots of conversations.  Lots.  And we were replaced by this shit in the end. 
[02:39:30]  And it's local, they could give away prizes.  Well, prize packs.  Prize packs.  That means you get more than just a CD.  Probably get like maybe a DVD.  A t-shirt.  And maybe a coupon.  Let's rock.  All right.  Here's the...  They hype up how great their show will be in this next clip.  And like you said, day one's over, because...  All right.  First, it's the first break, right?  You're like, all right, we got to get through this first.  Cracking the microphone.  Got that. 
[02:40:00]  I'm like, all right, all right.  Just got to get through this show.  Day one's over, and day two is going to kick ass.  We got bake sale tickets to give away today.  I believe we got some tattoo gift certificates.  We got wake and bake trivia coming up next.  A jam-packed show.  Stay tuned, and we will let you know about everything going on today.  I can't fucking take it.  Dude, I can't take it.  I hope people could appreciate the suffering that is happening right in front of their audience. 
[02:40:30]  This is the worst type of hack right out of college radio.  Like, it's so fucking bad.  If this is where radio's going, there's no place for us.  I'm telling you right now, there's no fucking place.  We are misplaced.  There's no fucking place.  I even said it yesterday.  Like, if Howard went back to regular radio, and they decide to go back with Howard down there,  you know, it'd be frustrating.  But you would at least understand why that would happen. 
[02:41:00]  Had success.  He's got a great track record.  Blah, blah, blah.  I know I'm saying that, and people are like, what, does he really lose his mind?  No, but we do try to be honest on this show.  But to be replaced by this...  I don't know what this is.  This!  This is hack small market radio that's not even good enough to be the top fucking show in  a small market.  Well, Loper and Schmitty take a call that insults O&A. 
[02:41:30]  All right.  It is 103.1 The Buzz, Florida's new rock alternative.  It is The Morning Buzz.  Hi.  With Loper and Schmitty.  How you doing over there, buddy?  Chilling.  All right, cool.  You know what?  Phones are ringing.  Let's take some phone calls.  Hello, The Buzz.  Yo, Loper, Schmitty, a.k.a.  Whisker.  What's up, man?  Who's this?  This is Super Dave, dude.  I call, like, all the time.  I've been hounding John O for the longest time.  I talk to everyone.  I've been talking to Mahoney, Trey, you know, David, everybody. 
[02:42:00]  And I was like, you got to get these idiots O&A off the radio.  You need to just bring back the old school, the way it was before.  Y'all have the morning show.  Do a little bit of music in between.  It's awesome, man.  561-550-9103.  Yeah.  Give them a call.  We'll get in trouble for this, too.  Trust me.  Hey, if they're going to fucking bash us, fair game, motherfucker.  You watch.  Fair game. 
[02:42:30]  Ugh.  Just kill.  That's great.  Take a call trashing us, and you haven't even done anything on your show yet.  Yeah.  That's brilliant.  Yeah.  At least entertain your audience, and then after a while, you can bash whoever you want.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry to interrupt you, but day two, we're up to Wake and Bake Trivia.  Again?  Oh, yeah.  Is this every day?  We played the one from yesterday, the Lighthouse Trivia.  Let's see what today's Wake and Bake Trivia is. 
[02:43:00]  I hope it's Caboose Trivia.  Hey, we got to do trivia, man.  Thanks for the call, bro.  All right, man.  No problem.  I'll be calling you guys a lot, man.  Cool.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  Keep it rocking.  Wipe away the fog.  And tattoo the haze with Wake and Bake Trivia.  That's a bong.  All right.  It's time for Wake and Bake Trivia.  I do appreciate the call from him, and it is 6-19.  Wake and Bake Trivia time.  Go ahead, dude.  Very nice. 
[02:43:30]  The category today, presidents, the prize, a Morning Buzz prize pack.  The question goes a little something like this.  Who is the only U.S. president to ever been known to wear a Nazi uniform?  A Nazi uniform?  Yes.  Hitler style.  All right.  Cool, man.  Wake and Bake Trivia.  Holy God.  Hitler style.  What?  What?  I said a la Hitler. 
[02:44:00]  George W.  I have no idea who would wear a Nazi uniform.  Woodrow Wilson?  I don't know.  That's before.  I got the answer if you need.  Oh, do you?  Yeah, he was the president in the early 50s.  50s.  Okay, and what was his name?  Who gives a shit?  President, who gives a shit?  Hey, we got to do trivia, man. 
[02:44:30]  Thanks for the call, bro.  Oh, well, here's the answer, I guess.  All right, 550-9103 or toll free at 866-954-ROCK.  What is your guess?  Hey, anyone get it?  Not yet, dude.  Go ahead.  Is it Reagan?  Yes, it is Ronald Reagan.  First guess.  Very, very good.  The reason, if you're wondering.  This guy is the epitome of wake-and-bake trivia right here.  Whatever, bro.  The reason Ronald Reagan wore a Nazi uniform is because before his presidential career, 
[02:45:00]  he was an actor.  Get out of here.  He played a Nazi in the 1942 film.  A Nazi, bro?  Yes, a Nazi bro.  He played one in the 1942 film Desperate Journey.  Hey, have you ever seen that film?  Yeah, like 17 times.  Okay, man.  Well, hang on one second.  We'll get your Morning Buzz prize back, okay?  Hang on one second.  The hilarity is so out of control that he can't help himself.  The fake laughing, the fake applause because someone answered a question right. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, God.  These are all the things we refuse to do on our show.  Always have refused to do.  It's what like anyone would refuse to do.  Why would you do these?  This is such small market shit fucking radio.  It's just shit radio.  Presidential trivia.  Let's go to fucking lighthouses. 
[02:46:00]  Let's go to David Wisconsin.  Dave.  Hey, man.  In all we know, that show really isn't all that bad.  I mean, all they're trying to do is catch the local.  Jimmy's pet.  Very good.  Let's say hi to Danny in Louisiana.  Danny, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Thanks.  Hey, man.  Like, Whisker Biscuit's got to be the stupidest radio name I've ever heard of since Sex Bagel.  Yes.  Why is it similar?  There's a biscuit. 
[02:46:30]  We've got to do the top ten worst radio names of all time.  Mine might be in there.  Sex Bagel is top.  Mine was a nickname as a kid.  I didn't make it for the radio.  Sex Bagel.  Sex Bagel's up there.  It's the worst, I think.  Number one.  Bubba the Love Sponge is way up there.  Yeah, that's a bad one.  Whisker Biscuit.  Whisker Biscuit or Schmitty Balls.  Schmitty Balls.  Free beer and hot wings got to be up there.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  Free beer and hot wings is awful.  All right, well, Schmitty does the sports smack. 
[02:47:00]  How come I'm getting a little thirsty?  I haven't had a lopweiser.  Hey, can we get Anthony a lopweiser?  Where's my lopweiser?  A-Rock, wake the fuck up!  Come on, A-Rock.  He's writing something.  He's...  I hope it's his last will and testament.  Oh.  Ah, oh.  Can I scream something out?  A-Rock's whole job when we get to XM is sit there and wait for a cue.  And it could be two minutes.  It could be 20 minutes. 
[02:47:30]  Just wait, though.  And we finally had to go to him, and I...  I don't give a shit you're writing!  Oh, boy.  I can multitask!  Oh, boy.  Here he comes.  And he's pissed.  You can't listen with half an ear and write at the same time?  We were on the phone.  What is this?  This is different than what?  The other phone number, they did something to it.  You can't call the 561 number anymore, so you have to call this number now.  What is it?  866-654-Rock.  Oh, okay.  Six or nine. 
[02:48:00]  I don't know what that is.  I'm just trying to help.  What is that?  Is that a six?  I think I heard him say it.  I think it's a nine.  954-Rock.  Oh, my God.  Shut up for two minutes!  Oh, my God.  866-954-Rock.  All right.  Well, let's get into some sports smack with Schmitty.  Oh, shitty.  The game sucked.  It was super boring, super sloppy.  It was 0-0 until 17 seconds left in the game when the Pittsburgh Steelers finally scored 
[02:48:30]  a field goal to win a riveting NFL game with the final score of 3-0.  This now makes the Miami Dolphins 0-11.  I mean, you know, it's not even fun.  It's not.  It's just.  It's pointless.  Yeah, I'll give you that. 
[02:49:00]  You said it.  That is fucking pointless.  You said it.  With the sports music bed behind them.  You said it.  They got to pick the hacky beds for everything they do.  Yeah, well.  The hackiest, like.  It's all about sounds, remember?  Jody in Columbus, what's up?  I wonder if this was towards the listeners Tuesday.  Yeah.  Yep.  There it is.  Good luck.  Well, we got joy.  John in Albany.  John, what's up? 
[02:49:30]  Hey, you were up here for a while, and those questions for the whatever buzz, I think they  were afternoon or something up here, it's the same exact fucking questions they were  asking up here about Nazi uniforms and all that shit.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they're taking the same shit down there, obviously.  Oh, bro.  Well, that phone call we played yesterday.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, that was fake.  Thank you, sir.  Well, we move on to Schmitty tries to convince Loper to root against the Dolphins, then wraps up  his sports smack. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, so Miami's 0-11.  I'm telling you, man, like a few of my friends who are Dolphins fans, you gotta hop on the  root for 0-16 bandwagon.  You're not hopping on that bandwagon, man.  It's depressing enough, and that's...  I'm gonna root against my team every week?  Is that what you're proposing?  I don't know, but you're kind of...  Then I don't have anybody to root for.  No, you're rooting for a draft pick.  And you're rooting for the fact that your team is so incredibly unique in the fact that  they went both 16-0 and 0-16.  No other team has done either.  I'm telling you, that's the way to go.  My name is Schmitty, the artist formerly known as Whisker Biscuit, and that is your sports 
[02:50:30]  smack.  This is baby radio, right?  Yeah, yeah.  This is like, you know when, what was it, the Archies?  They put out the special baby Archies.  Yeah.  This is baby radio.  Baby radio.  Like the voice is like a little like baby.  I'm Schmitty.  I have far, but I just far laid out.  He got a little chuckle out of it.  Yeah, I'm 20.  That he said it again about himself.  They don't even talk like human beings.  No.  Human fucking beings. 
[02:51:00]  You're like, ah.  That's why I think it's upsetting you the most, is that they didn't...  And I, I think any radio guys that have that, you know, he...  I hate the fake radio voice.  It's not a, it's something that you go, wow, how can you hold that up?  And it's like, that's what it is.  It's like, they're not saying nothing, you know, super bad or super good, but it's just...  Yeah, but it's just a thing that they're doing.  We were getting some, we were getting some things done down there and to be replaced  by this is what bothers me. 
[02:51:30]  Well, some people don't want reality, man.  You guys are, you know, you try, you, you, you speak, it's not a thing.  They just want basic, safe shit.  They just need that.  Some people, yeah, because you know, you know, most of the, most of the guys that come on  here, man, you know, comments, dude, they'll tell you.  It's like, the people, if you're out there with the people, they're fucking stupid.  Like, they're not begging for what you give.  They're begging for two guys going, hey, Colin, it's comfortable.  They don't want to go nowhere.  They don't want to think, man. 
[02:52:00]  It's such hack.  But it's scary business for, for some normal people to fucking listen normally.  Hey.  Well, we're on to, uh, later in the show, Loper and Schmitty take a spontaneous live phone  call.  Then we get a Lopweiser.  What's this about?  A spontaneous, something tells me he's being sarcastic.  No, they're just hanging out in the studio and they figure, well, I'd go to the phones  and see who's there.  And luckily this person is cool enough to get a Lopweiser.  All right.  It's more phoniness as they take a prerecorded phone call. 
[02:52:30]  And I'm going to tell you, there's certain comics, dude, that I get the same feeling.  It's not that you hate Smitty and Lopweiser.  There's 10 million of those guys.  That's what's bothering us.  Why would you want something different and real on your radio station?  You hate the people.  Like, you hate people for even accepting that.  Yeah, anybody who likes this, I would, I would, like, punch in the face. 
[02:53:00]  Like, you, you couldn't.  I wouldn't be able to hang out with anybody that listened to a show like this.  No.  All right, here we go.  The spontaneous phone call.  Uh, phones are ringing.  Let's, uh, take a call.  103.1 The Buzz.  Hello.  Hey, listen.  I got a trivia for you.  Wait, you're asking us trivia questions?  Like, real quick.  Wait, what's your name?  Yeah, nice.  My name's Sunshine.  What, do you want to stump the Morning Buzz?  Wait, do I win a Sunshine Morning Buzz prize pack?  Well, I do want to stump the Morning Buzz, actually.  But this is, like, some old school metal s*** or stuff. 
[02:53:30]  All right.  All right.  Bring that old school metal s***.  All right.  Go, go.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Go.  Hold on.  First of all, there's a massive sloppy cut in the beginning.  He goes, all right.  Uh, he goes to the phones, and then she says something.  It's a she?  Yeah.  Sounds like a she.  She says something, and then it's cut off very abruptly, because she must have said something  that didn't fit the call or whatever.  And then, let me also fill you in on this little tidbit of radio. 
[02:54:00]  There's no way to bleep a live phone call.  If someone curses, there's no way you can bleep that.  You can dump out of it, but there's nothing that can put a beep in over the curse when  you're taking a live call.  This is a recorded call that he is very, uh, in a phony way, trying to pass off as live.  My mistake.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Sorry, Sam. 
[02:54:30]  Phones are ringing.  Let's, uh, take a call.  103.1 The Buzz.  Hello.  Hey, listen.  I get a trivia for you.  Wait, you're asking us trivia questions?  Like, real quick.  Wait, what's your name?  My name's Sunshine.  What, do you want to stump the Morning Buzz?  Wait, do I win a Sunshine Morning Buzz Bride Pack?  Well, I do want to stump the Morning Buzz, actually, but this is like some old school  metal s*** or stuff.  All right.  Well, we can't wait.  Go ahead.  Bring that old school metal stuff.  Stuff, yeah.  Stuff.  Go.  The boys are telling me that the lead singer from Quiet Riot passed away.  Dead.  And we do not know his name. 
[02:55:00]  His name's Kevin Dubrow.  Kevin Dubrow, guys.  Hey, what are you doing?  Are you guys, like, are you up partying right now?  What are you doing?  Yeah, we're, yeah, we are, actually.  Oh, you're up from the night before?  Yes, sir.  Oh, yeah.  Congratulations.  Well, we're getting ready to go out and get some more beer.  Yeah, well, you might want to take a cab.  Drinking and driving is kind of frowned upon, you know?  You know what?  It's really great to have you guys back in the morning, man.  That's awesome.  Well, hey, here's the Lopeweiser for you.  Oh, shit. 
[02:55:30]  Jesus.  Oh, God, just smack me.  You talk about that drinking and driving shit if you work for an AC station.  Yeah, hey.  Like a family-friendly radio station.  If you're working on a station called The Buzz where it's about alternative rock and living  that alternative, like, you know, you're a rocker and stuff.  You don't want your morning show going, hey, safety first.  He's got two awesome kids.  He doesn't want them getting hurt from drunk drivers. 
[02:56:00]  Drink and drive.  I don't give a shit.  I just don't think a Lopeweiser is worth that much.  They give it up for anything.  Are you starting to think it really doesn't make much of a...  There's no value to it?  No.  Disappointed.  Oh, guys.  A Lopeweiser.  What the fuck?  Well, it's time now for the dirty word spelling bee.  Oh!  Are you guys ready for the dirty word spelling bee out there on the bleachers? 
[02:56:30]  I hope so.  Thumbs up, yeah.  All right, here we go.  Oh, man.  Lope and Schmitty explain the rules and give the first word.  What's this about, Sam?  Okay.  Well, they get a little edgy.  Oh, wow.  They kind of...  I mean, this is where I kind of was like, you know what?  Maybe these guys do know what they're doing.  All right.  All right.  All right, Sam.  Let's give them a chance.  Here we go.  Welcome to a game we call Dirty Word Spelling Bee.  Here's how it goes, fellas. 
[02:57:00]  I'm going to give you a word.  A dirty word.  Where's the bed?  Very simple.  All you have to do is say the word, spell the word, and then say the word again in spelling  bee fashion.  Just like school, man.  The first one to get three correct will be the winner in today's Dirty Word Spelling Bee.  All right, Josh from Green Acres.  You will be first.  Smitty with the first word in Dirty Word Spelling Bee.  Are you ready, Josh?  I'm ready.  All right, Josh.  Your first word in the Dirty Word Spelling Bee is scrotum. 
[02:57:30]  Scrotum.  S-C-R-O-T-U-M.  That's correct.  Scrotum.  Proper spellage of scrotum.  Josh from Green Acres nailing the scrotum.  It's not spelling.  It's spellage.  Spellage.  And I don't think it's about the spelling thing.  I really think it's about saying the dirty word.  I think that's the edgy part.  It's pretty outrageous to say scrotum.  I don't think they're really trying to educate people. 
[02:58:00]  Scrotum.  He said scrotum.  Not as outrageous as saying cunt.  Right.  But scrotum.  Okay.  And he nailed the scrotum.  Yep.  What's that about?  Like, schmitty ball scrotum is in lopester's mouth.  That would be the loper, the lopester.  He pops a lope cock.  Lope scrotum.  Well, it continues. 
[02:58:30]  Of course it does.  Go ahead.  I'm ready.  Rick from Gardens.  Your first word in the dirty word spelling is genital herpes.  Genital herpes is the next word.  All right.  Go ahead, Rick.  Two words.  All right.  Genital herpes.  It's G-E-N-I-T-A-L-H-E-R-T-E-S.  Genital herpes.  Genital herpes.  Yeah.  Both of these guys very skilled in the ways of dirty word spelling bee. 
[02:59:00]  Holy mother of God.  I, I, I.  We're almost done, by the way.  I'm beside myself here.  I'm just, I cannot accept that there are shows like this on the air.  I can't.  I can't accept that there's a company and PDs out there that are willing to allow our show  to be replaced by this.  Well, that's it.  Let them, let them, let them fly. 
[02:59:30]  Josh, your next word in the dirty word spelling bee is erectile dysfunction.  Erectile dysfunction.  Excellent words, Smitty.  Go ahead.  Erectile dysfunction.  Just laugh at erectile dysfunction.  R-E-C-T-I-L-E-D-I-S-S-U-N-C-T-I-O-N.  Erectile dysfunction.  You spelled dysfunction.  Incorrect.  Dysfunction is D-Y-S-F-U-N-C-T-I-O-N. 
[03:00:00]  All right.  To Rick in gardens for the lead, man.  Here you go, Rick.  Your big chance here.  Dirty word spelling bee, Smitty with the next word.  All right, Rick.  Your next word in the dirty word spelling bee is.  I like how he does that with his voice.  Gonorrhea.  It's gonorrhea.  Everybody loves it.  That's a hard one.  Why would you just say everybody loves it?  It's gonorrhea.  It's a hard one to get rid of.  G-O-N-O-R-R-H-E-A.  Killed it.  Very nice spelling of gonorrhea. 
[03:00:30]  All right.  Okay.  I got to go.  I can't.  I can't take this.  Sometimes you just let the audio play and it says a lot.  It's so easy just to yell and scream at this point, but why bother when you can just enjoy  the awfulness yourself?  This replaced us.  This replaced us.  Josh, your next word in dirty word spelling bee is fallopian tube. 
[03:01:00]  Fallopian tube.  Go ahead, Josh.  That's a dirty word?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That isn't even a dirty word.  They should call this official medical term spelling word.  It's not dirty.  That's not dirt.  Fallopian tube is dirty.  Let me tell you something, man.  Gaping is dirty.  Yeah.  Fucking right.  Fist fucking dirty.  Fist fuck.  Let's think of a few more dirty words here.  Oh, man. 
[03:01:30]  You know what?  Balls deep.  Leaking vagina.  Mm-hmm.  Pussy.  Pussy cock.  Pussy cock.  Stretched labia.  Yes.  Anything but fallopian tube.  That's a fucking shit.  Biology.  Shit cavity.  Hey.  You know, I'm listening to this shit, and I'm, you know, bobbing in and out, you know, 
[03:02:00]  but these guys sound like motherfuckers that used to be officially like, hey, how are you?  Hey, Greg, how are you?  And how are you?  And someone said, you have to get edgier to come back on the air.  Right.  These guys are forcing edge.  Yeah.  There's some people that do it naturally.  Like, the sports cast, you can hear the ones that do it like they just are miserable, but  it's for real.  Yeah.  And then you get the guys that's trying to go, whoa, hey, I'm going to, ah. 
[03:02:30]  These guys are just trying too hard.  This is not them, man.  Somebody put them up.  Matter of fact, y'all should talk to them.  Somebody put them up to fucking with y'all and fucking with Howard Stern.  Someone did that.  Someone said this is right.  They didn't want to do that.  They do everything the program director says.  They didn't want to do that shit.  That's what their job is.  So the program director tells them what to do, and they will do it.  They'll fucking jump in a second.  Because if you notice, they said O&A, and then they go, the comedy little bitch, which 
[03:03:00]  is, in radio world, Norton really is the little bitch.  Norton, his position is the little bitch, the comic guy.  But Norton's not a little bitch, so they don't listen to the show.  They don't know that they shouldn't say certain things.  They just go, okay, they have a little comic.  They didn't go, O&A, you punk motherfuckers.  Yeah, yeah.  We're coming after you.  They say, O&A, left, and they're a little bitch because that's who they can fuck with. 
[03:03:30]  They figure.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  These guys, man, are not, they're not, it ain't even their fault that they're on the  radio.  This has nothing to do with them.  This is, they're a victim of circumstance, and they're going to get attacked, and the company  that's trying to replace y'all with them is going to realize that they're not going to  be able to handle that shit every day coming off the top of their head.  Welcome to the fucking war.  Welcome to the trenches.  This is the fucking replacement that gets brought in and fucking gets shot. 
[03:04:00]  You see this piece of shit?  This, look at this lump of shit.  Lump of shit.  I got to hang him and tag him.  I got to hear how you spell fallopian.  I always wanted to know.  Josh, your next word in Dirty Word Spelling Bee is fallopian tube.  Fallopian tube.  Go ahead, Josh.  Green Acres, you're on.  Fallopian tube.  F-A-L-L-O-P-E-A-N space T-U-B-E. 
[03:04:30]  Fallopian tube.  Josh, you are absolutely horrible at this game.  It is actually F-A-L-L-O-P-E-A-N-T-U-B-E.  All right, we have one more here.  This will be for the win.  Oh, thank God.  I got to pick a good one.  Dirty Word.  I mean, make this the best because Rick from Gardens, dude, if you win, we're going to  hook you up with a Beowulf IMAX experience, man.  You're going to get to check out Beowulf in IMAX 3D. 
[03:05:00]  You go to the movies.  They send you to the fucking movies.  You save 10 bucks.  Wow.  That's the prizes that they were bragging about?  You go to the fucking movie?  And nobody...  Maybe they throw in some popcorn.  You never know.  Oh, God.  A large soda.  Nobody would ever do this bit without sarcasm.  Right.  Who was really...  Right.  ...edgy.  Yeah.  Like, there's no way...  Like, this is ridiculous, and this is dead serious. 
[03:05:30]  And here's the thing.  Listen to the callers, man.  This is...  Fucking...  Simpletons are like, oh, fuck.  And they're not even...  Look at these motherfuckers.  And they're not even...  They don't even have a dictionary in front of them or whatever to just spell it right.  Like, this is great for them.  It's unoffensive because...  I'm going to tell you something, dude.  And you know how I am about this type of shit.  It's just ballless.  They're taking slowly but surely any semblance of a guy being a guy. 
[03:06:00]  And at a show the other day, a motherfucker said to me...  He said what I said was inappropriate.  And I said, any guy who says the word inappropriate...  Men are supposed to be inappropriate.  Yeah.  Any guy who would say that means that he's a fucking bitch.  And the only time you should ever think about the word inappropriate is when you're doing bitchy shit.  Like, if you ever think you had to take a shit, but you just had to piss, and you was just sitting there with your dick between your legs pissing in the toilet, 
[03:06:30]  and you're just looking around like, fuck me.  I feel like a bitch.  This is inappropriate.  This is inappropriate right now.  Bitches think the word inappropriate.  These guys, for them to do this, they're so company that there's no...  Fellas, I'm telling you, you should just give these motherfuckers a pass.  No.  Can't.  No.  Can't give them a pass. 
[03:07:00]  No, it's the way...  I implore you to give these guys a pass.  It's the way of...  I implore you.  They need to be spanked.  And they are going to be.  They need to be spanked.  It's not even going to be fun.  You can hear it, dude.  They don't want nothing.  I want to see them under fire and see how they fucking react.  They're going to be scouring little faggots.  No chance.  How can they get out of this?  Let's talk about this.  There ain't no way out.  How can they get out of it?  It's not even a...  It's a much bigger issue.  It's just bigger.  Yeah.  What's the bigger... 
[03:07:30]  I don't know the first thing about these hacks.  What's the issue?  The issue is that this is where the radio world's going, and we're going to fight right to the last fucking minute.  They represent...  They represent what radio is in this day and age.  What this business has become.  Bitches.  Bitches.  Who gives a shit radio?  There's a trend to go back to local programming, and it's like, okay, if you're going to go local, then make it interesting.  This isn't interesting local programming.  Not to your local, but West Palm...  This is not interesting to local fucking... 
[03:08:00]  It's 80 million-year-old white people.  I don't care where you are.  What are they doing?  Not listening to Alternative Rock.  Here we go.  Oh, that show is the Alternative Rock.  That's right.  This is the last clip.  Trust me.  Let's see what amazing word they came up with as the final...  And y'all, I will say this, that you are both officially thoroughly annoyed, too, because it's not even a drop of really joking.  Oh, no, no, no.  It's just disgust.  It's just disgust.  Because you and a lot of people out there don't understand, like, I'm telling you, I'll say it again, the meetings, the phone calls, like, ah, fuck. 
[03:08:30]  You know, we were warned over six, eight months ago we were going to be replaced in West Palm Beach.  And I kept, like, fighting for us, going, come on, man.  And when does it happen?  Well, they haven't really found anyone yet.  But when they do, you guys are going to be replaced.  I'm like, well, that fucking blows right there.  We're being replaced by a show they don't even know about yet.  So they finally make their decision.  This is a long time coming.  And I'm thinking, all right, they finally found some fucking really good show. 
[03:09:00]  Heavy hitter.  Heavy hitters.  And then you turn around and wake up and you have to hear this is what you were replaced by?  It fucking hurts.  Let me ask you one more question.  Honest to the core question.  Has there ever been in any situation where you guys were replaced and you thought that the people that replaced you were good?  Oh, I swear to God, no.  Trying to think.  No.  Not one.  No.  I mean, could there possibly be one that would be where you would go, oh, he was okay. 
[03:09:30]  Not a one.  I watched the radio stations that replaced us and they're doing nothing since we left.  And they were, not that we were getting massive ratings, but we did just as good, if not better, than the shows that replaced us at this point.  I study this shit, trust me.  There's not a fucking show that comes to mind that replaced us.  I want to hear the last.  Not a one.  The final word is blue balls. 
[03:10:00]  Blue balls.  All right, Rick, Gardens, nail it, bro.  Blue balls.  B-L-U-E-B-A-L-L-S.  And I believe we have a winner with the proper score of the blue balls.  Rick from Gardens, you are the winner today in Dirty Words Spelling Bee.  Josh, I'll tell you what, man.  We'll hook you up with the Morning Buzz prize pack.  Everybody's a winner.  You guys tell me who's rocking it with music and the new Morning Buzz.  Looper and Smitty on one of the more ones.  The Morning Buzz with Looper and Smitty. 
[03:10:30]  The Morning Buzz.  Blast it right over the guy on the phone.  Who rocks?  Let us know.  Looper and...  The Morning Buzz.  I was talking here.  We got to use the deep voice guy to make this show sound cool.  Yeah.  Ramone.  More lasers to make these guys sound cool and edgy. 
[03:11:00]  Let's throw some echo in there as well.  Oh, that was...  Let's say hi to Drew in Nashville.  Drew, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hi, Ron.  Yeah, I think these guys make a pretty good point.  You know, they want to establish a base with their audience, talking about their kids,  and...  See, everyone's nodding off.  Yeah, Louie in Texas.  Speed round here.  We got to take a break, get into other things.  What's up, Louie?  Well, I'm just barreling down a Texas highway with about 80,000 pounds, enjoying my morning 
[03:11:30]  loat bliser, trying not to kill anybody.  Well, that changed the station.  I just need a connection here, though, to the Opie and Anthony show.  Is it just me, or do these two douches sound exactly the same, and they sound like Ralphie  May?  They sound exactly the same, and they sound like baby DJs.  Like, there's a weird thing going on.  Yeah, baby versions of DJs.  They're putting on that voice, but if you put on the fake voice, first of all, you're supposed 
[03:12:00]  to, you know, go deep.  I guess they can't go deep.  Like, it's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, we're on XM Satellite Radio.  Thanks for checking us out today.  You go down to this level, not...  I've been run out of 20 different interviews.  Like, you know, you go to some town, and I never have a good interview with those dudes.  Yeah.  What dudes?  Deep voice guys.  And here's what always happens. 
[03:12:30]  Patrice O'Neal.  Never fails.  Ready?  I say something that tries to be halfway comply with the fact I can't swear and halfway edgy,  and they go...  Okay.  Okay.  Well, Patrice is going to be at the...  Okay.  Well, thank you, Patrice.  He's going to be at the Chuckle Hut this week.  At the Laugh Cunt.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  Well, we want to make believe we're edgy, but when someone actually is edgy on our show,  then there's a real problem. 
[03:13:00]  We've got to get rid of the guests right away.  So, coming up, we can bring in the fake edginess.  We're going to do your mandatory metallic and want to thank Patrice O'Neal for stopping  by.  Make sure you check them out this weekend at the Chuckle Hut, because they're a sponsor  of our show, and they bring the comedians in every Friday to be edgy, but we don't want  actual edgy material.  Brian Springwater.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, I want to spell cunt on the air.  Please spell it with a K, just so we can all laugh.  Okay, we can spell it with a K. 
[03:13:30]  Because that would be outrageous.  That's crazy.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  Sean, Michigan, what's up?  I'm glad you did, though.  I swear.  Are you sure there's two DJs there?  Because it sounds like Jimmy Fallon and the man of the box.  Hey, man of the box.  Hey, we're black.  Yeah, well, that's what we got replaced by, and it doesn't feel good today.  Let's go to Patricia.  Patricia, North Carolina.  Yeah, I was agreeing with Opie. 
[03:14:00]  People are just horrid.  I mean, they sound so fake and stupid, and at least y'all are honest and intelligent.  Y'all may be horrid at times, but I just remember y'all about two weeks ago.  I'm still in love with y'all.  I just love y'all.  Anyone else get in the irony here, please?  Love it.  Okay.  Y'all just love it.  And tell Opie.  They all sound fake and stupid.  Stupid.  Yeah, we sound all stupid, don't we?  You sound fake and stupid yourself.  Tell Opie to make sure he gets a GPS for that stalker lady. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, uh...  Make sure when he gets a restraining order for that stalker lady from yesterday, make sure  they put a bracelet on her.  Yeah, I don't know what's going on with that weirdo.  You sound creepy, man.  All right.  Thank you, Patricia.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Let's see.  That was so fun.  Fikin' stupid.  Fikin' stupid.  Stupid.  Shane, Kansas, what's up?  Hey, I just want to know when Anthony became the pen and teller of radio.  Let me tell you how this... 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me...  That was kind of funny.  This is bullshit.  All right.  Let me tell you what's going on here.  There's a bad edit that's going to happen right in the beginning of the phone call.  You're going to hear the bad edit, and the beep you're going to hear.  I wonder if that was way too inside, because we used to have to cut up phone calls.  Yeah.  They take all the calls.  Every call you hear on that show is taken when the music is playing.  Sometimes, as a matter of fact, you might even be able to hear the previous song in  the background, which is hysterical. 
[03:15:30]  Because they weren't smart enough to turn down the monitor.  To turn the monitor down.  But all the calls are taken during the songs, and then they edit them during the  songs, and then when they come out of songs and talk, they play it back as if it's a  call.  And he's actually acting when he goes, let's go to the phones.  We got some here.  Hey, blah, blah, blah.  You're on the air.  And then he hits the tape machine, and it's the person going, hi.  Why are you looking at me and explaining it to me? 
[03:16:00]  Because you are the audience.  You are my audience.  All right.  Good.  Well, let me do the audience then for you.  Okay.  He's making the universal sign for jerking off.  I'm just fucking so taken by it.  People are still doing that.  Let's go to Jeff in Tennessee.  Jeff?  Yeah, the reason why you guys are took off the air is because, and I don't think you  guys realize it, you spend more than half your time whining and complaining, so-and-so 
[03:16:30]  said this, so-and-so did this, I'm upset with them.  Who wants to turn on their radio driving to work for an hour?  Say Frankus.  Nothing but whining, little bitches.  Say Frankus.  Just complaining all the fucking time.  It gets old.  We got you.  Say Frankus.  Say Frankus.  Say Frankus.  Let me tell you where, let me tell you where you made your mistake.  Oh, no, no.  I'm upset.  That's fine.  Guess what they said.  Let me tell you where you made your mistake.  You said, who would want to turn on their radio to hear? 
[03:17:00]  And my answer would be you.  Jeff in Tennessee.  Yeah.  Bye-bye.  And then he hangs up.  Let the jury see that he gave up.  See, you're not going to mess with someone with OCD.  Because he had nothing.  I'm going to let you said Baba Booey for the next 40 minutes, you tool.  That would have been fun just having the background, take other calls.  You're not going to win the OCD battle ever.  Jeff in Atlanta, what's up?  Hey, not much.  These guys must be filthy, stinking rich, because that voice I hear in every strip club I've 
[03:17:30]  ever been into.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's right.  Coming to the stage right now is the beautiful Porsche.  Give her a big hat.  That's Porsche coming to the stage.  You missed the obvious thing, though.  Yeah.  Hey, that's Loper and Schmidty.  Loper and Schmidty.  We're hosting tonight.  We don't get paid enough, so we've got to do all these bar games.  Here at the Titty Hut.  We have a lot of Lopwizers. 
[03:18:00]  We're going to be opening up.  Let me get a Lopwizer.  And we've got Schmidty balls.  Can't give me one at the same time as the song, you faggot?  Well, rest assured, we're drinking Lopwizers as Porsche makes her way out on the stage.  No truth to the rumor that Sean Taylor took the easy way out, huh?  All right.  Well, we've got a Communicate coming in. 
[03:18:30]  Oh?  If you want, not for me.  Use this from an industry insider.  An industry insider says...  See, now I'm using it as an industry insider.  Yes.  That's the brilliance of me.  Although I read the first part first.  So you know who it's from.  Well, not really, though.  Oh.  An industry insider says the following.  I have never heard a show full of more cliches in my life.  Ant was dead on about the sound effects.  Hack.  What's MNF theme? 
[03:19:00]  What's that?  Monday Night Football?  Yeah.  Oh, the Monday Night Football theme while talking about the game.  Jeopardy theme during trivia.  Bong sounds during Wake and Bake trivia.  Horrendous.  They are more of a parody of morning show radio than your weekly bits.  Well, we started the weekly bits to make fun of the fact that this shit actually happens.  Yeah.  Uh, what the hell are they thinking with this?  That's from a radio insider.  Industry insider.  I mean, industry insider.  It is a, uh, a parody.  Yeah. 
[03:19:30]  Of an actual morning show.  Like, you listen to it and can't imagine that that's a real morning show.  Maybe in two weeks they're going to be like, gotcha.  Yeah, yeah.  Now that would be genius.  To just go, dudes, we gotcha.  Fuck.  That's what we got to do next time.  We just, yeah.  Alright, we'll probably be fired soon.  And then when we, like, surface, yeah, that's what we do.  And then we just get on and do that type of radio, straight faced, all the production,  not one bit of sarcasm.  That's right. 
[03:20:00]  For two weeks.  And then we just go, uh, we gotcha.  If you were listening to that and enjoyed it, get the fuck off our station.  Go away.  You need to listen to 20 on 20.  They're too good at doing this badly to be putting it on.  I don't know, would we be able to even do it that badly?  We should try one day.  We should really just try a day of complete hack radio to see if it's even possible. 
[03:20:30]  If we're that good of actors.  We could do it after the break.  Yeah.  We need, but we need beds and questions.  I don't know if I could do it.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's, that's what, that's what, um, is in West Palm.  All the arguing and phone calls and this is, this is.  And that's what it is.  And this is what replaced us. 
[03:21:00]  That's it.  Holy shit.  And then people say that I'm self-destructed and losing my mind.  But I'm not losing my mind.  Oh, Loper and Smitty.  You're right for yourself.  I'm not losing my mind.  Smitty balls.  Formally.  What?  Whisker basket?  Biscuit.  Biscuit.  Biscuit.  Biscuit.  Why doesn't anyone ever see it my way?  Why?  The Lopinus monster.  I forgot about the Lopinus monster. 
[03:21:30]  But I'm the one that's insane.  Yeah.  They told me that.  But they replaced us with me.  When they're right, mine would understand this.  I don't get it.  Oh, my God.  Well, is that, uh, is that it?  Yeah.  Thank God.  That might end the Loper and Smitty bit because.  Yeah, because I can't see anything new coming out.  We played two days and they were exactly the same.  All right, look.  How about this, Sam?  Mm-hmm.  If you bring us Loper and Smitty audio, it has to be, like, top shelf shit. 
[03:22:00]  Top notch.  Top notch.  None of that cheap vodka.  We gotta go fucking top shelf.  Right.  Wait, no bar rack, Smitty?  No.  We want a nice Guinness, something nice.  Yeah.  One more day of listening to, uh.  But it has to be top on more day.  Top shelf vodka.  Look, I think I missed something in the bathroom, but I don't know if this suggestion's already made.  Why don't you guys, right, this will be fun.  Uh-huh. 
[03:22:30]  And if I could possibly join in.  Oh, boy.  Is this do an entire.  Hey, hi, ho, show.  You don't even talk about it.  Okay.  Did you already suggest that?  Are you feeling all right?  Yeah.  I was in the bathroom.  That's exactly what I said.  No, you were sitting there the whole time.  I'm.  I said.  I fucking went to take a piss in that smelly bathroom.  Oh.  You might have Alzheimer's.  All right, I'm just making sure.  And I'd like to join in.  I really would like to join in in the Hey, Hi, Ho.  How about Hey, Hi, Ho.  Four hours of it. 
[03:23:00]  How about Hey, Hi, Ho.  We do it next.  We do a Hey, Hi, Ho.  I want to do a whole show, but we need prep.  Ugh.  We need, like, hack prep, which is hard to come by.  Actually, it's pretty easy.  You just get that stupid.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Wait, let's get this on the air.  Oh, all right.  Jim on Long Island.  What's up, Jim?  Oh, and hey, how are you?  Hey, buddy.  Listen, I just had to wake myself up from a nap.  I finally got through to this call screener down there, and this jagass is actually trying 
[03:23:30]  to explain to everybody why they're good and why O&A really didn't take off down there.  I said, I'd rather jam knitting needles in my eyes and listen to these two parents.  Hold on.  Let's be...  What was his answer?  His answer was that we really never got O&A down here.  We were really a rock-hard station, and, you know, we're really trying to get the rock  message across.  Plus, he spent about five minutes trying to figure out where I was from. 
[03:24:00]  Apparently, the pests are doing their job and getting through to them and annoying them  a little bit.  But that's not rock station-type hosts.  No.  They didn't...  That's like...  I'm not kidding.  That would be like...  I've been around a bit.  That would be like top 40 in, like, the Poconos.  Right.  That would be like top 40 radio and possibly the Poconos.  Seriously.  I remember listening to Oprah on BAB when they were rock...  Dude, look, man.  I've come... 
[03:24:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  I will defend myself.  I've come a long way since BAB.  Absolutely.  But I never fucking did this shit.  No way.  That's what I'm saying.  These guys are a pair of assholes.  I always try to be a bit edgy and try to be myself.  You know, I was scared of PDs and stuff back then, so maybe I wasn't able to give it  my all back in the day, but I never went down this fucking road like they're doing.  Listen, keep up the good work.  You guys are the best, and the FDNY loves you, all right?  All right. 
[03:25:00]  Hey, thanks, sir.  Okay.  Back in the day, I actually had a contest where the first person to kidnap a 7-Eleven foreign  worker that didn't speak English got Grateful Dead tickets, and it wasn't fake, like, oh,  all right, well, let's get some intern or some fucking receptionist to play the part.  Fucking two people, I think they were two girls, I don't remember anymore, dragged a  lady.  She was in her 7-Eleven uniform and barely spoke English into the studio.  Had no idea why she was there.  Had no fucking idea.  Yeah, and I handed the dead tickets over to the girls, and we gave her a few bucks and 
[03:25:30]  said, get lost, get back to your job.  But these are the people, look, man, these are the dudes that go like this.  When you have discussions about things that bother you as a human being, these dudes go,  hey, man, it's a paycheck.  And what's bothering you right now is that you have some type of ethic, and it's fucking  you up.  Just don't give a fuck and go, hey there, hi there, ho there.  Yeah, unless that's the case, you're going to be all fucked up. 
[03:26:00]  These dudes don't, they're just going to go, hey, because there's somebody told, they may  have pain in their heart, but they don't give a fuck.  Can only help.  Dude, we're fighting the good fight because we're losing a lot of markets to shows like  this right now because the trend is to go local.  The trend is to go pussy.  That's what it's bitching.  But all I'm saying is if you're going to go local, don't replace us with shitty fucking  shows and then expect me to understand and not call you out on it.  But if they weren't local, local shows that. 
[03:26:30]  Who gives a shit?  They're just going to break them with dolphins.  The dolphins are 0 and 11.  Who gives a fuck?  That's what I'm saying.  They're not.  They, there's no national fucking dudes.  They're in fear because they know local dudes will just do what they're told.  Yeah.  You're not.  Local dudes will just go, hey, hi, ho.  That's what they'll fucking do.  They're not going to challenge the system.  And you know what?  Now we will get in trouble for talking about this over here.  I will get calls now today.  It's like, but what do you, and I would, I would say, what do you expect from me? 
[03:27:00]  Do you understand our position?  How frustrating this, this is to us that we work our balls off to be a little different  and interesting, and you replace us by hack shit?  Hack shit?  Bye.  All right, we'll move on to other things.  Yeah.  Why don't we take a break so I can take a leak?  Yeah, leakies.  Paging Dr. Leaky.  Dr. Leaky.  Hit it.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You're home for good, clean, wholesome family entertainment. 
[03:27:30]  F***.  Wow.  That is such a long way to go just to say f***.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's the, uh, it's the Opie.  And Anthony.  Hey, everybody, we're back here.  Don't throw me off the island.  We're back here with Opie and Anthony in the morning.  That's our good friend, Jimmy Fallon. 
[03:28:30]  Jimmy Fallon.  He, uh, was able to, uh, do that out of the kindness of his heart.  He, uh, did a little, uh, intro for us.  That is your program.  For our new radio show.  New radio show.  Ah, we got Patrice O'Neal as well.  What a funny guy, man.  We were just, uh, talking.  Very funny.  Very, very funny gentleman.  Uh, where are you going to be, Patrice?  At, um, Schnuckel's, um, Tickle, Tickle Bar.  Schnuckel's Tickle Bar. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, so many nights down there.  Popping a few, uh, and, and Pizer Bushes.  And Pizer Bushes.  And Pizer Bushes.  That's right.  Would you like a, would you like an old Pizer here?  Here's an old Pizer.  Uh, we got Than Adams if you want some of that.  Than Adams.  And Amph Still Light.  If you want a light beer.  That's plenty of beer that we could actually use our names for.  I don't know.  We need another, uh, music man for our radio show. 
[03:29:30]  Well, uh, it's now, uh, 10.43.  And what we're going to do is, uh, play our, uh, trivia.  We're going to do our trivia game.  What is it called?  Uh, we didn't think that far ahead.  Yeah.  But we do got the music bed.  And we're going to be giving away a prize pack.  What is the prize we're giving away today, Andy?  Well, the prize we're giving away is the, uh, Jimmy Fallon edition of Saturday Night Live.  Featuring Jimmy Fallon, our good friend. 
[03:30:00]  That's right.  Very appropriate, because he was in here recently boring the shit out of everybody.  Because he wasn't allowed to do his real stuff.  Because we wouldn't allow that on this show.  That isn't nice.  And don't say that anymore.  Oh, wow.  We're the new show here.  And, uh, I don't want people confused with the, uh, the old show.  Okay.  Here's a question.  And this one is about boats.  Yeah.  Boring.  It's about boats.  Boats. 
[03:30:30]  What is the metal screw-like object that is used to propel a motorboat?  That's our question.  For the prize pack.  Uh, once again.  Anyone got that?  How about once again?  It is early.  You know, people just wake up.  Let's, uh, let's go to the phones.  Uh, Alex.  How you doing?  Uh, good.  How are you? 
[03:31:00]  Hello.  How are you?  That's what I said.  Did you edit the tape right?  Uh, we didn't play enough.  Cut it properly.  We didn't play enough music in between.  Oh, damn it.  You didn't have time to cut out where you said hello twice?  No, I didn't.  I'm sorry.  Damn it.  Okay.  We're new at this type of radio.  Uh, answer the question.  It's a boat propeller.  That's right.  It's a propeller.  A propeller.  Wow.  You gotta clap.  Clap.  There it is. 
[03:31:30]  Fantastic.  I don't know why.  You are correct.  I don't know why people are laughing in the background, but it sure helps the radio show.  I don't know.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Somebody is suggesting that we give out hepatitis as a prize.  You wanna give out the hep?  That would be something Opie and Anthony would do.  We're, uh, we're friendly here.  We're flattened to a last to a wick. 
[03:32:00]  We're fake edgy.  We're actually broadcasting to, like, more of a family.  Anthony Balls with ya.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's why I like calling myself, cause balls is a funny word.  It's dirty.  Let's play some dirty word spelling.  Dirty word spelling.  All right.  Dirty word spelling.  Dirty word spelling.  Belly button.  Ho, ho, ho.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Are they gonna kick us off the air?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think we're gonna get kicked off the air by the boss.  You're outrageous. 
[03:32:30]  That's a big one.  Belly button.  Belly button is the word.  Belly button.  All right.  Well, we don't have any callers.  Oh, well.  It's B-E-L-L-Y-B-U-T-T-O.  All right.  Belly button.  We can do our mandatory metallic.  Ah, why don't we just rock?  We can rock a little bit.  We rock.  We can, like, string some phone calls together, edit them, make them sound very smooth, and  one, two, three, and then we can give the prize away.  Put beeps in them.  What is this?  What is this? 
[03:33:00]  Just another little bit of bed music.  Hey, sex bagel, what's this?  It's our own sex bagel.  Sex bagel.  You know, I just want to tell people what I've been up to the past few years.  One more.  Why are you?  Because we've been off the air the past few years.  I just want to let people know what I'm doing.  I, uh, I, uh, have two awesome children that I, uh, bought from Thailand, and I fuck  them every night.  Come on.  Come on.  I'm kidding.  That's not, that's like an old show. 
[03:33:30]  Ah.  Oh, my God.  Let's look at, uh, some birthdays today.  All right.  Uh, Bill Dye, uh, he's a TV personality.  He's 52 years old today.  And why would I give a shit?  Uh, because it's his birthday.  Oh, okay.  Uh, actor Fisher Stevens is 44.  Fisher Stevens?  Yeah.  What movie was Fisher Stevens in it?  I couldn't tell you, and I couldn't give a shit.  Oh, a fine actor, Jaleel White. 
[03:34:00]  You might remember him as Urkel.  Sure.  He's Urkel.  He's 52 years old today.  You're kidding.  Of course I am.  He's 51.  They had a kidney problem or something.  Oh, that's great.  Also on this date, Jimi Hendrix was born.  He would have been 55 years, well, 65 years younger. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, older than Urkel.  You know what him and Urkel have in common?  They're both d***ers.  Oh, shit.  I didn't say d***er, did I?  That's insane.  Wow.  Oh, are we going to get so fired for that one?  Speaking of, we got Patrice.  Don't call Patrice on s***.  That's not appropriate. 
[03:35:00]  Patrice is going to punch you in the face.  Patrice, we're not really Opie and Anthony right now, so don't hit him.  But you can hit the guy he's playing.  Reenact that high school scene, Opie, where you're with your basketball friends.  Oh, Jesus, my soda just exploded on me like a big cock full of jizzle.  Fellas, I just want to plug my...  Yeah, yeah.  Patrice O'Neal in studio wants to plug again.  The ninja in studio.  Where are you going to be? 
[03:35:30]  Where are you going to be?  Yeah, I'm going to be at...  That's fantastic.  That's fantastic.  Unbelievable.  I just wanted to make sure people knew I was going to be at...  That's great, yeah.  Give your plug, give your plug.  Chuckle Hut.  They're going to love you there.  The Chuckle Hut.  Patrice O'Neal, ladies and gentlemen.  Yes, one show Wednesday, one show Thursday.  And you can be white and get in, right?  Is this true?  I just wanted to know if this is one of those black shows where the white people have to sit there and go,  I'm the white guy that's getting made fun of. 
[03:36:00]  Jesus.  I mean, I can't guarantee you.  White people are crazy.  Yeah, white people.  I'll sit up front and you'll pick on me and fuck my girl.  You know, I've seen it happen.  I've seen it happen.  What show have you seen a guy fucking girl with?  I go there and when there's a black guy on stage and the white guy sitting there with his girlfriend,  he usually picks her up and the white girl usually ends up leaving to get that big man dingo cock.  That's right.  That's right.  Usually, you know you got the big cocks. 
[03:36:30]  Usually, the posse takes the boyfriend to the bar and gets him drunk while the girlfriend's getting gang raped in the back.  And then they pick his pockets and use the money to play dice out back.  There's not going to be any gang rape at the show.  No gang raping?  No, no.  Just jokes.  I mean, it's not scary wilding.  Just scary.  Very scary.  I know that you people like to wilding.  Go wilding.  Wilding?  Yeah, yeah.  What's that wild at all about?  Is that what they call?  The kids are calling it these days.  Wilding?  Wilding.  Wilding. 
[03:37:00]  Wilding.  Wilding, yes.  That's when you just all go crazy and you throw garbage pails through windshields.  Fellas, I'm just going to be a chuckle host.  Because you're outraged.  Chuckle host.  Outraged.  Scary.  Oh, wow.  Look out.  Look out.  Oh, wow.  Oh, no.  That's scary.  Look out, Anthony.  We got an angry meat girl in the studio.  Jesus Christ.  You guys might.  You guys.  Yeah.  Angry Negro. 
[03:37:30]  You guys mind plugging the show?  Yes, of course.  Where's our Angry Negro alert system?  I don't think we have that.  Yeah, we do.  Oh, E-Rock.  I like this song.  It's playing the soul music for our soul brother.  I just want to make him feel comfortable on the show.  Yeah.  See, we can relate to you, brother.  Listen, how many more segments?  I don't think I can keep this up.  Damn it. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  How many more segments are we doing here?  Wait a minute.  There it is.  Hey, you want to get Patrice out of the studio?  Yeah.  There we go.  Look at him.  It's a siren.  Look at him run.  He's scared.  He's running.  There you go.  Oh, he's a siren.  Back.  Duck.  Duck, everybody.  Jesus.  Yeah.  End scene. 
[03:38:30]  End punt.  You guys are fucking terrible, man.  Thank you, Patrice O'Neal, for stopping in today.  Thank you so much, Patrice.  You know, it's all in good fun.  What fun?  Is nobody having fucking fun?  It's all in good fun.  Yeah, just having fun.  You know, it's like the Ebony and Ivory song.  You know, we have our differences, but we can get along afterwards.  Get along.  We all get along.  Everything's a joke that we say.  I didn't really mean, you know, to drop the N-bomb when I said that. 
[03:39:00]  What N-bomb is that?  Like, what, nigger?  Oh, Jesus, girl.  We're in trouble now.  See?  Here it is.  This will bring everyone together.  Let's sing the song.  Ebony and Ivory live together like white people and nigger.  Oops.  I can't use the word.  Fake outrageousness.  One thing, though, you never see the black keys on the piano beating up the white keys. 
[03:39:30]  But that's what happens in real life, right, Patrice?  Where are you going to be?  Where are you going to be?  Because that's what people want to know, where they can see your comedy.  Right there on the piano.  Your brand of comedy.  The white keys living right next to the black keys.  Oh, my God.  Where does that happen?  Look, the other white keys don't care.  What about this white key is dating this black key, and this white key is the father, and he's all upset.  Is that hysterical, Patrice? 
[03:40:00]  You want to put this in your comedy act?  You ever think of putting this in your comedy act?  Don't go put it on.  I'll charge you.  I'll make me charge you.  I'll send you a bell.  I'll send you a bell.  How do our listeners get tickets for the big comedy show?  Yeah, the comedy show.  Where is that?  The chuckle what?  I think there's some tickets still available.  All right.  Tickets are available.  And what kind of comedy can the people expect?  Is it going to be like Chris Rock?  Are you like Chris Rock?  No, I wouldn't say I'm like Chris Rock. 
[03:40:30]  Chris Rock.  I like that guy.  He's black, too, isn't he?  How about Bill Cosby?  Bill Cosby, maybe?  Bill Cosby.  He sits down on a stool and talks about...  He waxes fantastic about the old days.  Yeah.  Something like that?  Like Bill Cosby?  Bill Cosby?  Not necessarily, no.  I'm trying to think of what comic.  Can I give out the numbers?  2-1-2-5-5-5-0-8-6-0.  All right.  0-8-6-0.  That's great.  Fantastic.  And what a guest he's been today.  What a sport.  He's been terrific.  What a sport.  He really is.  He's been a fan to a last of them. 
[03:41:00]  I like playing a sound effect.  Me.  Oh, no.  You got chocolate right in the studio.  I did.  I can't take it.  Oh, I can't take it anymore.  Oh, God.  Shoot me.  Shoot me.  Shoot me.  Us.  That's kind of fun to do, though.  That only took up 10 minutes.  That was it.  Imagine having to do that. 
[03:41:30]  Four hours.  Four hours?  No.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Line of the day, Tom.  Hey, where is that Poderican?  Hey, Poderican, can you get my truck?  Try not to steal the hubcaps.  You know how they are with hubcaps.  I don't know what they do with them.  Oh, fantastic.  He's probably too busy playing dominoes.  They sure like that.  I hope there are no chickens in the back, but I'm trying to drive home with the feathers 
[03:42:00]  going.  Oh, Master Poderican.  That's what I call them.  Dominoes.  Dominoes and chickens.  That's all we know about the Spanish.  That's great.  Master Poderican.  That's great.  I love those people.  I love the Hispanics.  I love it.  In the delivery room, when a baby girl comes out, they pierce those ears before the umbilical  cords cut.  What is it with the pierced ears on the little Hispanics?  Instead of handing out cigars, they hand out knives to everybody. 
[03:42:30]  They like stabbing people.  They can't behave engraved on the side.  I understand.  Oh, good gravy.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  We screw the X-Emmers.  All right.  Back to us.  Scott, Tennessee.  Scott.  Let's be honest, guys.  This last ten minutes, it's not even funny. 
[03:43:00]  It's annoying.  To the point where my ears hurt listening to this shit.  Yeah, that's what we were going for.  Annoying.  We were going for annoying.  We were going for that since the time you came on XM.  We were going for annoying with a little bit of sarcasm.  Maybe a laugh or two.  And some, was there any irony in there, a little irony?  A dash.  A dash of irony.  Here's the thing, guys.  You guys do your CBS show. 
[03:43:30]  I love it.  All right?  Hey, time to bang on the drum all day.  Thanks for the call.  All right.  Thanks for the call.  Thank you.  It's time to bang on the drum all day.  I want to thank Patrice O'Neal for stopping by.  Make sure you check out his podcast.  PatriceO'Neal.com.  And everybody.  Yeah.  I know how to work.  Oh, oh, oh.  You jumped the gun there, pal.  Oh, sorry.  Here we go now.  Yeah.  I know how to work.  That guy was a whole fool. 
[03:44:00]  I know how to work.  I don't want to play.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Hey, Patrice O'Neal.  We've been checking out his podcast during the commercial break.  Yeah.  Very funny, Patrice.  How many podcasts you got up there?  25.  But they're like...  Damn.  It's like a TV show.  Yeah, it's not really like your normal podcast with somebody sitting there pontificating about  some bullshit.  He's doing like funny stuff. 
[03:44:30]  Funny skits.  Yes, sir.  Funny, funny skits.  A lot of good ones.  Oh, wait.  Hey, we got Nick in Canada.  Nick?  Greg and Tony?  Yes.  Yeah.  I had to say I don't like the new show.  I love it.  Linger, linger.  Linger, linger.  Chris, Minnesota.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, I can just tell that Patrice just wants to smash you fuckers.  He's just got this voice like he just wants to smash you fucking head. 
[03:45:00]  I'm glad that came out over the radio.  Yeah, Chris, yeah, he writes just like, hey, it was not even funny and I want to smash  you fuckers even though I love you.  Hey, it's Patrice's idea.  Hey.  All right, here we go.  Patrice, we were watching your Patrice for President podcast.  Mm-hmm.  And just a little taste for the people, but they should check out the whole thing on  Patrice.com.  Oh, hell yeah.  The visual's great, man.  Yeah, it's a lot of visual stuff, but this is one of the ones with some funny stuff. 
[03:45:30]  Patrice explains why he trusts white politicians in this clip.  I've been comfortable my entire life with white presidents.  Old white men presidents.  I feel more comfortable when I see old white men doing some kind of shit.  You ever see a black pilot on a plane?  You'd be like, where the fuck is this motherfucker driving to where the real pilot is?  Or a black doctor?  Let's be honest.  Black doctor come out like, hello, I'm Troy Mofungo, your surgeon.  You'd be like, you ain't putting your black hands in my chest.  A surgeon? 
[03:46:00]  What you gonna operate on, my pinky toe?  Because that's the only thing I'm gonna let you touch, nigga.  Holy shit.  But the whole, the whole...  God damn, you speak the truth.  The whole point of that is to let you know that, look, there's some white things I feel  comfortable with too, but presidents is one of those things that tricked us over the  years.  And they haven't done a fucking thing.  Oh, fuck.  That is the truth.  Oh, wow. 
[03:46:30]  All right.  Patrice for president.  He talks about gay marriage in this clip.  It's quick.  How come being gay is a preference, but tying a bitch up and peeing on her is a fetish?  Patrice.  Patrice.  Patrice.  On abortion.  So you're saying you're pro-choice?  I think it's a woman's right to choose.  Look, I think a guy should have, during a woman's pregnancy, if he gets a woman pregnant 
[03:47:00]  that he don't want to get pregnant, he should have one, one time and one time only during  the whole pregnancy where he could just punch her in the stomach.  Oh.  Or do a running, like a straight up running karate kick.  How about one of these running, like one of these niggas, like I get a running thing,  I go, bitch, you pregnant?  What is wrong with you? 
[03:47:30]  Oh, there's nothing else.  There's nowhere else you can even think about doing anything.  Right, right.  Kicking a woman in the stomach.  No.  I'm just joking.  Somehow, I'm just joking.  Somehow.  Somehow, I'm just fucking joking, dude.  Wow.  And finally, Patrice on the war.  If I was your president, I'd be like, nigga, the war's over.  Try to get an exit strategy.  Why the fuck?  Exit strategy, right?  What the fuck is that?  Let's just bounce.  Be like, hear ye with one of them old belts.  Hear ye, hear ye. 
[03:48:00]  Get the fuck out this shitty hole.  This hot, sandy shit.  You feel me?  I'm dead.  Like that shit, right?  I'm dead.  Smart.  I'm smart as a mother fucker, huh?  That's first hoe, by the way.  First hoe.  Damn, that's smart.  Yeah.  Time to make it out.  Yeah, I'm tongue kissing first hoe. 
[03:48:30]  Mr. O'Neal.  Oh, let me get back to my speech, bitch.  Yeah.  Damn.  That was me slapping her ass.  How about age statistics?  Yeah, that's what I'm doing these days, fellas, until the next thing.  That's funny shit.  There's some cool ones up there.  Some are dead.  Some are great.  Some are middle.  It's all right.  I like your mother fucker. 
[03:49:00]  Mother fucker.  Mother fucker.  Can we just play the first part of that?  They've done very well.  Can we get it real fast?  I can play it real fast.  I don't know.  Yeah, I know.  Yes, I know.  Okay.  I think he was talking about the word fag or something, but it starts off with the word  motherfucker.  Oh, faggots, faggots, faggots.  Yeah, the many uses of the word motherfucker, though, is really...  We'll end with this.  We'll do line of the day, and we'll get out of here.  Patrice O'Neal.com.  O-N-E-A-L, right?  Yes, O-N-E-A-L.  And if I...  Someone just found a white dude. 
[03:49:30]  O-N-E-A-L.  And I'll be at Comics over on 14th and night.  Comics is a nice club.  I've been there a couple times.  It's nice, man.  I'll be there December 28th and 29th, two shows.  They're trying to get something going down there.  On Friday, two shows, Saturday.  They're trying, but I'm going to be there in case I don't see you guys before then.  When is it again?  It's December 28th and 29th.  Two shows, Friday, two shows, Saturday.  Yeah, right after Christmas there.  Okay.  Come down, man.  Right on.  This is Patrice O'Neal talking about the word motherfucker.  Great. 
[03:50:00]  Oh.  This one?  Yep.  Go.  You know what I'm getting tired of?  I'm getting tired of motherfuckers always taking words literally.  Like the word motherfucker, for example.  You can use that word to describe a potpourri of emotion.  Hey, motherfucker.  Hmm, motherfucker.  Ow, I stubbed my toe.  Motherfucker.  Oh, shit, I'm late.  Motherfucker. 
[03:50:30]  So, look, we're going to be taking some other offensive words and showing you that the meaning  shouldn't always be taken so little.  Like this word, for instance.  Baggot.  Yeah, you had the right out, but you can see the rest on Patrice O'Neal.com.  It's long.  That's the only reason.  Yeah, no.  All right.  Thanks for playing a couple of my...  Fuck, it's good, man.  Yeah.  Funny shit.  I'm going to go home and check out more of that shit.  Line of the Day is brought to you by BodogFantasy.net. 
[03:51:00]  Free life scoring, stats, bios, and news that will help you win big this season in fantasy  football.  All at BodogFantasy.net.  Net.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  Can you imagine a choice of old white woman or oats being thrown out of a helicopter?  It's like that's your choice.  That's your choice.  It's like I'm with the rest of the tribe where I got to catch giant bags of rice without water  and eat...  Eat that gruel out of that wooden bowl.  Oh, man.  Or just... 
[03:51:30]  Or eat that gruel.  Or eat that gruel out of a dry wooden bowl.  You got to think this is a no-brainer, man.  You're right.  That was like a tag team.  Gruel.  Like that.  Gruel.  That was really funny.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  I just know one thing about the Greek culture.  It's what everyone knows about it.  And the 300 were doing it, too.  Right.  The 300.  King Leonidas was doing it up, too. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  Flip over.  This one's for Sparta.  Ass sex.  Ass sex joke.  Fucking up the ass joke.  Leonidas.  It's significant, though.  It's not...  I thought this shit was just some...  Shit people with...  Greeks.  They love fucking in the ass.  They just know from...  Ass fucking.  Love it.  Ass fucking.  That's because they had all that, like, olive oil around.  They needed it for something. 
[03:52:30]  Easy access.  I've been to Greece, man.  There's just olives everywhere.  And that just makes you...  You got to do something with all those fucking olives and olive oil.  With the oil in the pits.  The pitted olives and the oil make you just want to fuck something.  How could you not?  It's everywhere.  Green...  A black pitted olive just looks exactly like an asshole's shit look.  Look at this idiot.  Who?  Oh, Ellen?  Oh, Ellen.  She's just a fucking idiot.  I know.  I was just looking at that, and I just... 
[03:53:00]  She doesn't have to do that.  That's the weird part.  No, it's sponsored now or something.  You know, this is what we're...  Look at it.  What is she doing?  This is why I think we'll never, like...  I don't know.  Maybe I should shut up.  Because dyke bitches are taking over men's places.  No, that's all right.  I actually find her funny.  I really do.  But I'm like, why would you do this?  Yeah.  Why would you dance every day?  It started out as a goof bit, and now, like, she's known for that.  She has to do that.  She has to do that.  And if you're a guest and you don't come out dancing, you're an asshole. 
[03:53:30]  But it goes back...  As I found out.  But it goes back...  Right.  You didn't want to dance?  Hey, it's the web junk guy, and it's like, she's coochie-cooing.  I'm like, get out of here, you fucking dyke.  I have no chance of making it sexual, so what's the point?  You should have come out tap dancing or something really bad, like in 1930s attire.  It just goes back to what we were talking about earlier.  Fucking America eats this shit up.  Yes, but I don't know if they really do.  I mean...  I look at this and go, wow, are women that dumb?  And this is what they find entertaining, an older lesbian dancing every day for them? 
[03:54:00]  Ones in the audience seem to, because they're clapping and dancing.  And I think...  I truly believe, even though it's common knowledge at this point, that half the people that go  to Ellen's show and are dancing in the audience as Ellen's dancing have no clue that she licks  pussy.  Stop.  I swear to you.  I bet you that they have no fucking clue.  I wouldn't argue with her.  I wouldn't argue with her.  Because you can see how comfortable they are with it, and in general, like housewives,  they're not comfortable with that type of show. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, they don't like that shit.  I bet you they have no idea, even though it's common knowledge at this point.  Yeah, I guess.  They're dancing, and Ellen's like getting fucking wet in her pants, like, oh my God, I get to  dance and rub up against women every day?  You're not lying, dude.  It's something...  I bet you.  There's an underbelly of something that I just don't understand.  I just don't think people are looking for that, but they are, man.  Tyra Banks and this show and The View, I watched it, my mother came to visit me for, you know, 
[03:55:00]  Thanksgiving.  She was watching The View, I watched like five minutes of it, I said, this shit, literally.  Dude, I watched it.  In front of my mother, this shit is fucking awful.  Dude, I watch it, I watch it religiously, because it's so bad.  And I'm like that too, but it's...  I'm a big fan of watching stuff that is so awful.  I'm like that too, I'm the same way, but that was not good, man.  I yell at the screen, because I've met Joy Behar a few times, you guys know her pretty  well, or a bunch of the guys that come in here, and she's not that person that's on 
[03:55:30]  The View.  Joey Behar was an old school, like, cunt, but in a good way.  Yeah.  Like, one of the dude comics, like, dude, she was one of the few women that, like, dudes  was like, oh shit, like, Joey's a fucking soldier, but...  I don't know why she's not in movies, she's a great actress, she is playing a part on that  show that's not her.  It's a paycheck, nigga.  It's not her.  It's a paycheck.  Every once in a while, she'll let her claws come out a little bit, but that fucking... 
[03:56:00]  She been in the trenches so long, somebody gave her a fucking six figures one week, and  that bitch said, I'll be an old yenta with nothing to say.  Yeah, whatever you want.  I don't give a fuck.  She bought a house.  Right.  Fuck that, nigga.  Who the fuck's calling me?  Bill Collector's calling me now, and it's just like, it makes you nervous.  I used to tell Bill Collector's, lick my asshole.  Lick my fucking asshole.  I get tax letters, and I get nervous now, because you got something.  It's that handcuff shit.  Fuck that.  I'm ready to be homeless again. 
[03:56:30]  Because it's just...  Your manhood is getting fucking shitty, dude, because we got to watch this goofy shit.  It's either men, like, what we like...  I saw some thing called Mansers on Spike TV.  It's called Mansers.  And it's like questions that they ask men, like, how much does a titty weigh?  And it's just like, all right, that's cool.  But that's not us.  That's the dumb us that women love.  They don't like the fact that we're stronger and play chess.  You ever meet a bitch that can play chess?  Ever. 
[03:57:00]  Ever in your fucking life.  As a matter of fact.  No.  And you never will.  It's just, that's what they turn it into.  She's the man now.  Ellen's the man of the relationship.  We're just fucking done.  Where is there one motherfucking man on TV?  One.  Well, I mean...  A dude, like a fucking dude with...  Well, there can't be dudes on this time of the day.  Why?  Because they're all working.  Where the fuck can you find a dude except for UFC?  But they punch each other in the face. 
[03:57:30]  I joke, but TV's still old school.  They're catering to women that are at home.  That's soap opera mentality.  Yeah, there's no fucking dude watching Ellen, for the most part.  There's no dude watching The View.  This is all programming for women that stay home.  Anywhere.  Even at night.  Other than wrestling, boxing.  You got your Jay Leno and David Letterman.  I don't do the, you got your Jay Leno's and David Letterman's.  There's only one of each.  You got Jay Leno, you got David Letterman and Kimmel and all those guys. 
[03:58:00]  They're doing their thing because there's more like dudes that are watching at that time.  All right.  There's no dudes watching TV during the day.  Unless you do a radio show and you have nothing else to do after you get home.  That's the only reason.  I guess there's still a lot more women at home than guys.  Even Dr. Phil, I watched that shit and he's always, the woman's always right.  He sucks.  Of course the woman's always right.  It's always the dude that's fucking up the world.  Like, it's like. 
[03:58:30]  Of course, because he's.  Like, you know women ain't shit, Phil.  Why don't you just say it once?  You bald-headed asshole.  Just say this bitch ain't shit.  He's not dumb.  His show caters toward women.  So, of course, he's going to take the women's point of view all the time.  Of course.  That's how it works.  When's it going to stop?  And that's why, you know, we're here.  Because we just don't feel like playing the game.  It goes back to the Loper and Schmini and all that other shit.  Don't want to play the fucking game. 
[03:59:00]  That's why I don't even.  Let me tell you something.  That's why Nickelodeon asked me to do something years ago.  And I knew I had the propensity in my life to possibly get caught jerking off in a movie theater.  So I said no for the fact that I already know I'm fucked up.  So I'm not even going to take these goofy jobs that they offer you.  If Disney ever made a mistake and offered me a job, I would have to go.  And it'd be for millions.  I'd go, look, this contract would have to say I get this money up front.  Yeah.  Because I might be caught with your suitcase full of glass dildos. 
[03:59:30]  I might stick it in my garage or go to Brazil.  Some hooker says, yeah, yeah.  He was fucking double dildoing me at the same time.  He does that kids show.  And he's like fucking me in the mouth.  Yeah.  Like, it's just ridiculous.  That's what happened to your boy dog.  You know?  He knew he was a goddamn racist.  A phony.  He was never my boy.  He could have got away with that if he just said, look, give me a break.  Nigga, look at my hair.  Yeah.  Look at my wife. 
[04:00:00]  I'm a redneck.  I was reading some of the tabloids today, the really bad ones in the supermarket.  And a lot of times they're pretty accurate.  That's the weird part about those things.  And they said that the Aryan nation there put a hit on them.  Trying to kill them.  You read that too?  Yeah, for whining.  For whining about it.  Stop whining.  For what you call a son uncovered it.  Roy Ennis' son.  Yeah.  We did read about that.  I wonder how true that is.  I bet you it is true. 
[04:00:30]  But it's like, I bet you they're not even tired on the racial level.  They're just tired of it on a man level.  To see this guy who runs around the world arresting people with no gun.  Yeah.  And he's just sitting there crying like a bitch instead of going, oops, I got caught.  Look, I tried to hide as long as I could.  But look at it.  Let's be honest.  I'm going to be buried in an old slave burial ground.  And he said that.  Like, he fucked up.  Yeah.  Like, black people can't even, like, be happy to see him just.  We would have loved him if he would have just said, yeah, I do be saying nigga. 
[04:01:00]  What you going to do, man?  I mean, I say nigga sometimes, man.  You don't say cracker.  Tell it true, black people.  You don't say cracker.  And I was like, yeah, I say cracker all the fucking time, man.  And I don't feel bad for him because he was a sneak and all that shit.  But, man, what the fuck?  This world is coming.  We're really getting pussied up.  And what's happening is men are now pussying ourselves up.  We're now the ones controlling ourselves.  And now women can just sit around and just chill.  And just relax.  And sit on the toilet and pee and bleed for no reason anymore. 
[04:01:30]  The nation's doomed.  You think so?  This country is doomed.  We are a witness to the tail end.  Maybe not the fall.  Maybe in our lifetime we won't see the actual fall of an empire that was once great.  We had a short run, too.  You will see.  It's only been what?  How long has it run?  Since 1945?  The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long, my friend.  1945, we started running shit?  Ever since that big mushroom came along, we started running shit. 
[04:02:00]  I would say the beginning of the industrial age.  We really, you know, the early 1900s, we really started, we were doing pretty good.  And then, yeah, after the war, yeah, I gave us like, yeah, yeah, about 100 years of running  things.  But, you know, a couple hundred years ago.  We can't even get a main dynasty run?  We can't get 5,000 of it?  From beginning to end, I'm talking.  5,000?  5,000.  We are headed down the road to ruin.  And what is the main reason why you think? 
[04:02:30]  Well, of all people, Pat Buchanan put out a book, and he talks about the things that are  just ruining this country.  The jobs going overseas, the devaluation of the dollar to the point where foreign countries  aren't even going to be on the dollar anymore.  They want to switch to the euro or some other denomination.  Like, everything in the old days used to be the dollar.  It was always the dollar.  You know, everything was based on it. 
[04:03:00]  The stock market, other countries would base their money on the dollar.  Now they don't want to anymore.  It's like, yeah, go fuck you.  What is it, the war?  The European, the war is a part of it.  The, just the economy, the influx of immigrants, illegal immigrants coming into the country.  There's just a lot of things that are happening that are all pretty much based around this political  correctness that's going on.  No one has the balls to really crack a whip and say, this is what we have to do to really 
[04:03:30]  get the country back in the right direction.  No one wants to do it because they're afraid of making enemies and they want this and that.  They want to please everybody.  You don't get anyone anymore like a leader like Reagan who didn't give a flying fuck what  his opposition said.  He said, no, I'm doing this.  Go fuck yourself.  And then he'd do it.  Well, Bush is kind of like that, man.  Bush is a douche.  He isn't like that.  So you're waiting for Giuliani to be the president.  He's like, you know, I think we might be beyond the point of no return here. 
[04:04:00]  Certain, we're also, what did he say?  In his book, he was like, we're divided also amongst racial and financial lines, like class.  Class and race have separated the country to the point where, you know, there could be  a civil war over this shit.  It's just, we don't like each other, basically, basically speaking.  Actually, authentically. 
[04:04:30]  Yeah.  And definitely we don't like each other.  We just don't like each other as a people.  You say it's something bad about him, about, you say something bad about us, we say something  bad about you, we say something bad about Puerto Ricans or Asians or something.  And everyone flies off the fucking handle.  How is a country supposed to be, like, united when everyone fucking hates each other in  the country?  And it's just getting worse.  And then it's also getting to the point where the Southwest will be annexed by Mexico at  some point.  There's just going to be so many Mexicans, they're going to go, we own this shit a few 
[04:05:00]  hundred years ago, we're taking it back.  And who the fuck's going to stop them?  They're running everything down there.  How come we don't make a deal and just go, look, we'll make Mexico the 51st state and hook  that up, hook Mexico up like it's America, so they want to stay.  And then, like...  I think that's going to, would take way too many resources.  What is...  Some major problems down there.  It's like taking over, because they do have some oil down there, though.  But I'm just saying, build a bunch of McDonald's, just, you know, America... 
[04:05:30]  Americanize.  Americanize it.  You know what I mean?  So they need to put a couple of, you know, a bunch of Mickey D's and this, that, and  that.  I would imagine financially we just can't get it done, and that's why we haven't done  it.  I bet you that's all.  It comes down to money.  It ain't like we...  They don't have workers.  They come over here to work for nothing.  There's plenty of them.  There's such poverty, man.  That's true.  That would take a...  There's also so much corruption.  Like, you ever see the police force down there?  Forget about it.  That's what I'm saying.  We go, man, just fucking take over Mexico. 
[04:06:00]  Take over.  You know what, though?  Donkey shows.  Yeah, that's a moneymaker.  Right there is a big moneymaker.  Franchise.  Franchising opportunity right there.  Right?  I just...  It's just...  Yeah, it's very interesting.  It stinks, because I'm trying to make a little fucking money, man, and it's just nowhere for  me to be.  Dude, that's an interesting thought there, but I don't know.  I bet you it's a financial thing.  Just make Mexico the fucking 51st state. 
[04:06:30]  I don't think Mexico really wants to be, is what the problem is.  That's the biggest problem.  They're not just sitting here going, could you please...  Yeah, but the people in charge over there are doing just fine, and I don't think they  want to give it up.  But I don't think that many Mexicans are coming here fucking shit up.  They're coming here doing jobs that no American wants to do.  But they live like a third world country.  They come here and they live in a lot of these shack towns. 
[04:07:00]  You ever see down in the Southwest?  There's like just shanties that they're living in.  They work in the fields or wherever.  They come back to it, and they're making this third world estate down in the...  There's third world conditions everywhere.  There's poor, poor people in this country.  Yeah, but you don't want to import third world countries.  If we have them on our own, then we got to fix it.  Our poor...  I've never seen a poor anybody being a delivery person, cleaning up a fucking hotel. 
[04:07:30]  I've never seen any...  Mexicans have cornered the market on horse shit employment.  But that's why...  And that's why we allow it to happen.  You don't think we could stop that if we wanted to?  I don't think we could.  Absolutely.  Cleaning up Walmart from 12 to 8?  Like...  Who the fuck else does that besides them?  Do you think...  Do you absolutely think that Walmart wouldn't get clean, Ben?  If there were no fucking illegal immigrants...  If nobody would clean...  You'd walk into a Walmart and go, holy shit, no one's here to clean. 
[04:08:00]  There is someone that would take the fucking job.  No, it's more than that.  It's cheap labor.  You don't have to worry about health insurance.  None of that crap.  It's still cheap labor.  It's all money under the table, my friend.  I'll tell you what.  No accountability for your employees.  For fucking...  From the time I was probably 15 until my early 20s, I did fucking Mexicans jobs.  I did.  I did all the illegal immigrant jobs.  Dishwashing.  Can I...  Fucking landscaping. 
[04:08:30]  All the shit jobs.  That's what I fucking did.  And I wasn't saying, I want $19 a fucking hour.  I was just hoping for a little Jack Daniels beer and cigarette money.  You wanted to say N-work.  What?  Yeah.  No, it was Mexican work.  Yeah, but you adjusted for...  You wanted to say N-work?  I didn't say I wanted to go into a life of crime.  You adjusted for our friend.  Did you want to say N-work?  No.  I think he did.  Did you want to say coon jobs?  No.  I had a feeling that he kind of adjusted that.  Let me ask you this one last question, man. 
[04:09:00]  I was N-rich after I did Mexican work.  Let me ask you one last question.  This is all drifted into seriousness.  I'm going to ask you this.  Yeah.  Me and my man was having a conversation about this.  Is these big corporation white guys, these fucking guys that sit on the top and they  rubbing their hands together.  The harumph guys.  The harumph, harumph guys.  Harumph, harumph, harumph.  Is there like, it was like, okay, Area 51, for instance.  Yeah.  Are they that evil where there's an alien somewhere and they go harumph, harumph, it's an alien. 
[04:09:30]  Or harumph, harumph, there's a hole in the ozone layer that's killing everyone.  But I'm going to not fucking sell you electric cars to make things better.  It's harumph, harumph, money.  And no matter what the cost.  Is there any humanity to these fucking harumph, harumph guys?  No, not as far as black people know. 
[04:10:00]  Anybody.  No.  Like a fucking alien is somewhere in a bunker and he's going harumph, harumph.  We have to figure out the evil angle.  There's no cigarette smoking man.  There's no harumph, harumph guy.  There's just no.  No.  No.  Those guys that sit up in the corporations that make a lot of money, they're part of the  problem too with the country.  There's a lot of greed up top that isn't getting the money down to the bottom.  And that happens. 
[04:10:30]  Is there not one motherfucker at the top of the pile, harumph, harumph, right?  Yeah.  Who goes, Jesus Christ, man, we're killing everybody.  No, they don't care.  They just, it's greed.  It's not this big conspiracy or anything.  It's just, it's the way it is.  Just 50 million collateral damage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Cancer.  That's it.  We got the cure for AIDS, but having the cure won't make money.  So we'll just have something that makes you feel better.  I don't think they got the cure for AIDS.  They got it somewhere. 
[04:11:00]  You think so?  Yeah, your people are hiding.  I don't think that.  Where is it, Obi?  Where is it?  Where's the cure for AIDS?  I just know about the Department of Liquor Stores in Black Neighborhoods.  I know about that division of white people.  You see, I have a problem with that.  It's like, we, I just, sometimes, you know, to be individual and be black is, it's tough.  When you stand alone or you want to, it's like, okay, is it black people or is it me?  Right.  Now, when somebody says, and again, I could be, I'm ignorant on this, but when somebody 
[04:11:30]  goes, yo, motherfucker, you know, guns in the community, black community, nigga,  we don't, nigga, we ain't Smith and Western, nigga.  Black people don't make guns.  Smith and Western.  Black people don't make guns.  And I'm like, well, is that why you shot me?  That's why you shot me?  Because we don't make guns?  Yo, nigga, I ain't got no motherfucking poppy feel.  Is that why you sell me coke? 
[04:12:00]  I don't understand that logic.  What about the liquor one?  You got to have one for the liquor.  There's a liquor store in every neighborhood.  Is that why I'm an alcoholic?  Is because there's a liquor store in every neighborhood.  I understand the plot to kill us.  Right.  But don't drink.  Solve your own problems.  Like, don't shoot me.  Right.  Would solve the problem of guns in the community.  Yeah.  Don't shoot me.  All we are saying.  I got to agree with you on that one, Patrice. 
[04:12:30]  That's a damn valid point.  And with that, here is your line of the day.  Oh.  Here comes the light of the day.  Light of the day.  I guess they're size queens.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They say the monster guys are big enough to reverse menopause. 
[04:13:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[04:13:30]  It's not wacky enough just spelling it.  It's got to be a little zany.  Thanks, fellas.  Mr. O'Neal.  Y'all can talk about me now.  Thank you, sir.  But I thought like...  We're getting the fuck out of here, too.  Yeah, I did.  N-word action.  You got shit happening.  Never.  We snuck the N-word in today.  Just snuck it in.  And we knew we could because our pal Patrice was in the house.  That's all it takes.  That's all it takes.  All right, man. 
[04:14:00]  All right, boys and girls.  It was fun.  And that's it, yeah.  Yeah, we'll see you.  Oh, you'll hear us.  We'll say manana for all the Mexicans.  Manana.  The O.P. and Anthony Program.  Or that stupid XM stinger they do.  What is it?  XM 202. </pre>
