<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a chaotic recap of a disastrous staff meeting.  Anthony described falling asleep and subsequently taking pictures of a colleague's genitals.  He characterized several colleagues as "Walking Ambien" due to their drowsiness.  E-Rock, another staff member, reacted explosively to a memo detailing his apparent slumber during the meeting, storming out and throwing his headphones.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, along with other unnamed staff members, discussed E-Rock's outburst, his upcoming birthday, and the increasingly desperate attempts to appease him with cake and banana pudding from Magnolia Bakery.  Sam, a staff member, acted as a go-between, relaying increasingly negative updates on E-Rock's mood.  This initial segment was rife with vulgar language and humorous anecdotes criticizing the meeting's structure and the relationship between on-air talent and management.

The attempts to cheer up E-Rock continued, taking a bizarre turn when the hosts misinterpreted his request for a "hero sandwich" as a desire for "hero songs." This led to a series of inappropriate musical selections, further upsetting E-Rock. Sam was dispatched again to determine E-Rock's actual musical preference, only to discover he simply wanted the show to end on time.  The conversation shifted to E-Rock's birthday (the exact age being debated—40 or 33), and attempts to lighten the mood with references to *The Greatest American Hero*.  The hosts mentioned the presence of guest Dominic Lombardozzi (*The Wire*) and planned segments featuring a 1993 internet enthusiast and audio from Derek labeled "Stinky Vag Stingers."  Charlie Sheen's recent Twitter activity and media appearances, his catchphrases, and comments on porn stars were also discussed extensively.  Jim Norton attempted to mediate between E-Rock and management regarding the fallout from the meeting.  Despite the initial turmoil, the birthday celebration eventually eased tensions with E-Rock.  The segment included considerable vulgar language, sexual references, and discussions of drug use, particularly regarding Charlie Sheen.

Dominic Lombardozzi, guest actor from *The Wire*, was then introduced.  The conversation covered *The Wire*'s lack of writing awards, its gritty realism, and Lombardozzi’s experiences filming the show, including interactions with cast members and the challenges of avoiding typecasting. He discussed other acting roles, including *Breakout Kings* (heavily promoted), and shared anecdotes from his early career, including working with Robert De Niro on *A Bronx Tale*. A humorous segment played a recording of Lombardozzi and Rich Voss rehearsing a scene.  The conversation included off-color jokes, references to Charlie Sheen, and discussions of the challenges of working on film sets and the frustrations of long days, concluding with another plug for *Breakout Kings*.

A substantial portion of the show focused on Charlie Sheen's custody battle with Brooke Mueller.  The hosts discussed Sheen's denial of threatening Mueller,  TMZ reports of the alleged threat ("I will cut your head off, put it in a box, and send it to your mom"), and Sheen's legal battle with CBS over *Two and a Half Men*.  Audio from a Les Moonves interview was played, discussing CBS's ability to manage without Sheen.  The hosts speculated on the motivations of those involved and the media's reaction.  This segment also revisited the ongoing conflict with E-Rock, who remained largely silent despite the hosts’ apologies for their handling of his birthday.  The discussion veered into a running gag about the number 33 (as the age of death for several famous people), a listener's story about a pizza shop owner using mice to sabotage a competitor, and a discussion about a disruptive audience at a Jimmy Norton stand-up show.  The hosts also briefly discussed wrestlers, particularly Gangrel.

The final segment contained highly offensive language.  The hosts criticized a male guest's behavior at a public appearance, calling him various derogatory names and comparing his behavior to Michael Richards.  They engaged in gossip about celebrities, including Lindsay Lohan, John Galliano, and Charlie Sheen, using crude and sexually explicit language. A study about longevity was mocked and interwoven with continued celebrity gossip and offensive jokes.  The segment concluded with mentions of upcoming show appearances and the presence of Jim Gaines and Scott Hamilton as in-studio guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  What are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fucker.  Have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Funny.  Morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  Hi.  There's always something. 
[00:01:30]  Always something.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm just hearing rumor and innuendo.  What's they say?  Rumor and innuendo.  Rumor and innuendo.  In-guendo.  In-guendo.  In-guendo.  Hi.  Good morning, everybody.  How was the meeting yesterday?  I was good.  What happened?  Anything good?  Hold on a second. 
[00:02:00]  That's my way to go.  Oh, I got you.  I got your cable there, Jimmy.  Where's Jimmy?  Where's Jimmy?  He's under the console getting his cable and blowing me.  Yoo-hoo.  Well, the meeting yesterday after the show was really good.  It's too bad you missed it.  I didn't want to miss it. 
[00:02:30]  Physically, I was there.  Physically, you were there.  I think technically you missed the big meeting.  The big meeting.  The big creative meeting.  Creative meeting is what they call it.  I don't know what it's.  It's a creative meeting.  We've been avoiding meetings for a really long time, and yesterday proved why we avoid  meetings for a very long time.  Oh, thank you.  They actually did minutes.  Minutes?  We're radio guys.  We don't know what minutes.  It's like a town hall meeting.  Okay, can we go over the minutes from last meeting?  Yeah, last meeting. 
[00:03:00]  So I'm sitting there in, by the way, that giant, cushy seat.  Next meeting, you're going to have to get one of those bad seats.  Next meeting?  There are a few bad seats.  Don't people meet now from, like, fucking the internet?  Don't they do?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Use, like, gotomeeting.com and shit like that.  It was the cushiest big fucking chair.  I got in there early, so I'd get a good seat, like a movie.  Or to start your nap.  Or to start my snooze.  We went, I guess we went a little long yesterday for the show. 
[00:03:30]  A little bit.  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  Yeah, we're supposed to be here until 10, but some days.  We do the right thing and go a little later if something's happening, right?  Something's going on.  Yeah.  And walk down the hall, I go into the meeting room and sit in the chair and wait for everybody  to file in.  All the creative people to file in for the meeting.  That would include everyone from the program.  Could you name the creative people and then the rest of the people?  Oh, my God.  Well, there's Jimmy, me, Opie. 
[00:04:00]  We got Danny, Travis.  This is the list of the creative people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sam is in there.  Roland.  Roland.  Kenny is in there.  Kenny is sitting behind the keyboards.  And let me think.  Who else?  Did he say Danny?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Danny was quite creative in the meeting.  You missed all his creative ideas.  Oh, thank God we have a rat in there.  E-Rock.  Thank God for that. 
[00:04:30]  He just slammed his pen down.  He's like, shit.  Oh, God.  Why is he a rat?  I don't know.  I guess we'll get to that.  Okay.  But then the rest of the people I call Walking Ambien.  Walking Ambien!  Why don't you list the Walking Ambien today?  Well, there's Steve Blatter.  Oh, Jesus.  And then there's Shemp and Curly. 
[00:05:00]  You know, the other two.  Oh, boy.  No, because I've had it.  Oh, boy.  I've had it.  Are you doing a Charlie Sheen?  Yes.  All right.  I am doing a Charlie Sheen here.  Nice.  I've had it.  Here's Anthony's schedule, just in case anybody doesn't fucking know.  I wake up.  I come here and do the program to the best of my ability.  Full of piss and vinegar and energy from the time the fucking enough of this palaver 
[00:05:30]  or Stacey Keats or whoever the fuck else intros to God fucking show.  Full of piss and vinegar.  I'm yelling.  My arms are flailing.  I'm having a good time.  And then by 10.45, I swear to you.  You like that?  By 10.  Thumbs up, Danny.  That's a great picture, man.  I got a story about that, too.  By 10.45.  My pud picture. 
[00:06:00]  Pud.  Pud.  How old are we?  You got a picture of someone's pud.  Well, this is what happens if you keep a...  Because I can help you out a little bit.  I didn't fall asleep, certainly, but I have my own issues.  Yeah.  I mean, we were in there for an hour and a half.  That's what I want to say, too.  Thank you.  After doing the show.  Holy shit.  An hour and a fucking half.  After doing the show.  Right.  So I start fading, and I start taking pictures of puds.  Pud pics.  Pud pics.  And then the one person that had to come walking down the hall and go, 
[00:06:30]  Ah, next time you need a zoom on that camera.  He was trying to make believe it's all cool and fun and light.  I don't think he liked it.  I could tell.  I've been around way too long to know.  The picture of the pud.  That he was so annoyed that I took a picture of his pud.  His pud.  You mean somebody in management didn't like his genitals being photographed?  In the meaning?  Surprising.  So annoying.  But he came in all lighthearted.  Like, oh, we're all just one happy family.  Yeah.  Next time, get a zoom lens. 
[00:07:00]  Actually, I took a picture of him covering up his pud.  His pud, yeah.  Because the whole meeting, he was trying to hide his pud because his pants were too tight.  Hide that deliciousness.  And I purposely didn't get his face because that would be like a real problem with HR.  No, you don't do that.  So then you wonder who it actually is.  Right.  You don't know.  And I didn't mention the guy by name.  I said this guy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  I recognize the way different people cover their cocks when looked at. 
[00:07:30]  You recognize the pud?  I recognize the white socks.  It's on my tour.  It's Bowser from Sha-Nan-Nan.  That's where I take it out.  Oh, sir.  Yeah.  So anyway.  Oh, God.  Full of piss and vinegar.  I made it for about half the meeting and then I started kind of...  Started phasing.  Well, my eyes started wandering around going, what could I do in here?  To entertain myself.  I'm sitting in the chair and it's all cool when we first are all in there because, you  know, it's all the people from the show and we're all hanging out and stuff like that.  And then it goes... 
[00:08:00]  It's called a creative meeting.  Yeah.  Which is nice for the show.  A show meeting.  That's good.  What it is, in essence, and I swear to you, this is how Anthony sees it.  It's a corporate executive spreadsheet type meeting.  We're not talking...  It's not done like a bunch of us hanging out laughing going, holy fuck, that's a great idea.  Holy shit, let's work on that.  Why don't we use this instead?  And, like, fucking a little brainstorming or something like that. 
[00:08:30]  First, the minutes are read from the previous meeting.  And Travis has to...  Ladies and gentlemen, he should have a gavel.  It's like a town hall meeting.  And he reached it and then I'm thinking, as he's reading it, I'm thinking to myself,  wait, did we do this meeting already?  Is this a best of meeting?  Well, that was yesterday.  The last meeting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It seemed like a best of meeting.  It's a best of meeting.  And he goes through it, and then... 
[00:09:00]  It's to show us where we're at with some of our ideas.  Enough!  We don't need...  That's not a creative meeting.  Uh, Travis, can you tell us where we are with the dick measuring contest?  Oh.  Well, last meeting, we discussed who would be measuring the penises.  Yeah.  Oh.  Pens and legal pads don't belong in a creative meeting.  You jot this shit down on a fucking cocktail napkin when you're hanging out or something.  What was the last thing you remembered before you were out cold? 
[00:09:30]  Oh, my God.  My eyes, first of all, were doing that thing.  It was like, rawr, like I was in a shaking machine.  You ever had...  You're so tired that your eyes feel like they're in a shaking machine, and you can't quite keep  them in one place.  Listen, so that was going on, and then, uh...  And I...  I remember just corporate babbling gibberish, and like I said, by 10.45, I am home, in bed, 
[00:10:00]  asleep.  That's my hours.  This is how I fucking operate.  Other people don't.  Other people...  Everyone has their own shit.  Their own schedule.  Mine is that I sleep a couple hours, and then I wake up, and I'm good to go.  Because Anthony likes having some type of life.  So I'm good to go.  And then, I come in, like I said, do the show, full of fucking vigor.  Vim and vigor.  Vigor.  Where's the vim part?  The vim?  Maybe the whistle.  All right.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:10:30]  Here's...  I have plenty of vim.  And vigor.  And vigor, the bell, because it rhymes with...  Right.  ...your favorite word.  Right.  That's right.  Trigger.  Right.  Exactly.  That's right.  And, uh...  So then, so then the meeting, which was supposed to be like, I don't even know, it's like supposed  to be kind of fast, kind of, not even fast, like a quick, like, like hallway meeting, but  not an hour and a half? 
[00:11:00]  Well, this is different...  For what?  This is different than the, yeah, the, uh, the walk to the elevator meetings.  The walk to the elevator meetings.  Which are literally a minute to two minutes long.  Right.  Right.  And I swear, I swear on my family, there is nothing that cannot be put in a fucking email  that I could read at 1.30 p.m. when I'm awake.  Because I can't take it.  I can't sit in a fucking room with a bunch of people sounding like office space. 
[00:11:30]  It's beyond me.  It's not a meeting like we are when we hang out.  And we're just bullshitting about ideas.  That is, to me, it's fun.  And it's, it's, it, it's thought-provoking.  When, when people are blurting ideas out and they're being knocked out like fucking  baby seals on an ice flow. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, that would be a great idea.  But, thwock!  Over the head.  There's another pelt.  Ideas turned into pelts.  And I, I, I can't take it.  Is it good for the company?  So, I was like, uh, uh, nodding off.  And then occasionally my head would pop up and I'd be like, uh, what's, uh, what's going on?  Yeah.  Oh, that thunk.  Back out thunk.  I hear the fucking, I hear the words of, of, of Mr. Ambien. 
[00:12:30]  You do know your name's on the billboard, right?  I see!  Okay, it's everywhere.  That's right.  You know why?  Because I sit in front of this microphone and I talk.  It has nothing to do with sitting in a meeting.  I can't do it.  I'm physically incapable.  I have meeting narcolepsy.  Meeting narcolepsy.  And now we get to the E-Rock part. 
[00:13:00]  He just threw his arms up.  And it's his birthday.  Happy birthday, E-Rock.  He just threw his headphones and he walked out.  Well, here's what I hear.  Why do you walk out?  He's mad.  Here's what I hear.  Here's what the grapevine is saying.  Well, no one knows for sure.  I don't know for sure.  No one really knows.  But I think something was jotted down.  No one really knows.  I think something was jotted down on a management's, uh, pad.  About my contribution to the meeting.  Which might have been in brackets saying sleeping. 
[00:13:30]  Is he going to get in trouble?  I don't know.  Is he going to get in trouble?  Don't get him in trouble.  Well, he didn't do anything that, no, no, I'm not talking about you.  I'm not talking about, look.  They're all nodding their heads like you just got E-Rock in a lot of trouble.  Can I fucking, can I?  And here's the deal.  Holy shit.  He's just trying to be a soldier and now he's in a lot of trouble.  No, no, he's not.  Poor little fat soldier.  All he tries to do is show his loyalty to you, sir.  I know.  And that he actually is a soldier in the end.  We all love him.  He punched the wall.  He punched the wall.  He threw his headphones.  And now he's, he walked. 
[00:14:00]  And left the room.  It's his birthday.  Let me tell the birthday boy and everyone else something.  Let me tell the birthday boy and everyone else something right now.  Remember, you're on the billboard.  And everyone listening.  So you got some power here.  Anyone listening.  Let's make sure we don't get E-Rock in trouble.  Because this is great radio.  This is me talking.  Anthony Cumia.  From the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Sorry, do you have a middle name?  No.  Wow, that's weird.  I don't either.  You guys don't have middle names?  I'm going with a new one.  I knew we were supposed to fucking do radio together.  Sheen. 
[00:14:30]  Ooh.  That's it.  Sheen.  Because that seems to fit into this whole fucking situation.  Jimmy asks, I was supposed to be Frederick Wilford Hughes III.  Ooh.  Frederick Wilford?  You wanted to put off getting laid as long as possible?  Exactly.  Are you royalty?  Sounds like royalty.  And my mom actually put her foot down and said, hell no.  That was a good move on her back.  Hell, wow.  And then it's just a very simple name of Greg Hughes.  No middle name.  Wow.  And I didn't know you didn't either.  And it's not Gregory, by the way.  No, I know. 
[00:15:00]  Yes, it certainly is.  Well, only when text talking.  NMN.  As you put down on a little sheet.  No middle name on any application or anything.  Yeah, man.  I don't want to share this soul with another person.  Right.  I'm me.  I'm me.  Right?  That's it.  Me, me, me.  My middle name should have been me.  Me.  I want to, I absolutely want to put this forward, though.  I want to get this out.  Well, he threw his headphone.  E-Rock.  He's going home.  It's his birthday and he's going home.  Why is he leaving? 
[00:15:30]  He's going home.  E-Rock.  You really?  What happened?  Sam, what happened?  He can't go home.  Is this it for E-Rock?  E-Rock.  I'm taking all responsibility.  He's going home.  E-Rock.  And I've never seen Sam so scared in his life.  What's going on, Sam?  I don't think we're going to hear a fucking sarcastic asshole Sam right now.  It's on his birthday.  I know.  He can't do this on his birthday.  But that's why I am.  And we got stuff for him.  Do you realize?  We actually got stuff.  Do you really?  Well, he's not going to.  And he was just trying to be a soldier.  Doesn't seem like he's going to be around to see it.  He can't go.  He's got, he didn't do anything wrong.  Look, but for, I'm going to, I'm giving him a gift. 
[00:16:00]  He didn't hear the last part of it.  No, he didn't.  He heard the first surprise part.  Wait, wait.  There's another part to my birthday gift.  Hold on, but we can get a little inside, uh, uh, some insight here.  What happened?  The second part is called impunity, motherfucker.  I'm not bearing any responsibility for this.  I am taking all responsibility for this.  Make sure Kenny, uh, demands that he stays.  Yes.  Were you in there when, uh, he lost his shit?  Well, he went, he left, and he just walked out to, like, the big windows. 
[00:16:30]  And he was just kind of, you know, gripping his fist.  Contemplating jumping?  Yeah, yeah.  At this point, he was like, what the fuck?  We don't need that.  The next two buildings will skip, like, a record.  It's his birthday.  Happy birthday, E-Rock.  Happy.  Oh, no.  And then he basically said he was, he's fed up with this shit.  Fed up.  How is it his birthday, and we all get a gift?  I'm kidding, E-Rock.  I love you.  It's his birthday.  He really can't leave.  No, he can't leave.  And so, that's when you heard him just shaking at the walls? 
[00:17:00]  Well, yeah, he was, he was gritting his teeth, and he was like, he was like, I, I'm fed up with this shit.  And he pushed the door to the producer's studio open and said, give me my bag.  And Travis and Troy were like, the feedback.  Are you, it's not the time.  No, it's not.  So, Travis and Troy were like, are you leaving?  And he wouldn't say a word.  He just angrily grabbed his bag, and he walked out.  And then he said, I'm, and then he said, I'm out of here.  Well, I, I, I absolutely want all of the people to know that E-Rock has nothing to do with this. 
[00:17:30]  It's not E-Rock.  This is between me and Mani Gio-Mente.  It's, it's not between E-Rock or anything else.  It's, it's me, Anthony Cumia, from the Opie and Anthony radio show,  having a problem with these meetings and not E-Rock doing anything.  He didn't do anything wrong.  Don't fucking go to E-Rock and be like, oh, oh, what did you do? 
[00:18:00]  Oh, because, because that, that's, that's underhanded bullshit.  He probably would have preferred if you had just said somebody.  What the fuck does it matter?  Good.  You know what?  That's the most creative part of the fucking meeting.  Is that this camaraderie between the fucking show that you can't fucking undermine?  Do you get it?  Do you get it?  There's the show and then there's management.  That's how it's always been.  Talent and fucking management. 
[00:18:30]  Never the tween shall meet.  It's not creative.  When management is sitting in a creative meeting, it's not creative.  Let me sit in on one of your finance meetings, motherfuckers.  Let me sit in on that and see how much I can contribute.  Because I can't.  I'd be asleep.  I'll go in there.  I'll go in while you talk about how many fucking pens you gotta buy.  And fucking desk blotters. 
[00:19:00]  Blotters.  Bumper stickers.  Bumper stickers.  Bumper stickers.  T-shirts.  T-shirts.  Don't forget the ice scrapers.  Holy mother of fuck.  Listen.  E-Rock is still in the office.  This could go either way.  E-Rock, this isn't about you.  Is he listening?  Should I go talk to him?  Happy birthday!  Yeah, go.  You have to give him a cake or something.  I didn't know it was his birthday.  I have to stress the fact that management should understand this is a good thing.  There's camaraderie amongst the show members. 
[00:19:30]  And the fact that E-Rock is willing to actually go into somebody's office and look through their notebook after hours.  Exactly.  This could go either way.  I'm serious.  He's sitting in the office pretty much crying.  Well, he's kidding.  He knows that.  I know.  Sam is seeing what's going on.  I'd hate to hear that angry thump coming down the fucking hallway.  Oh, I guess what I would add to this.  If you're management and you're writing Anthony sleeping.  Yeah.  And one of the guys sees that.  Yeah.  You've got to understand that that guy, whoever it was. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Maybe it was an E-Rock.  Whoever it is.  It was E-Rock.  It's too late for that, I guess.  Oh, I don't care.  They certainly are going to tell us.  Yes.  Because that's what we do as team members.  Of course they're going to tell us.  And then, of course, it's going to come out on the air.  Of course.  We're on the team.  You're in the fucking clubhouse watching from the window.  We're on the field.  We're on the field.  It's just nice to see we're all one again.  Right.  This is a good day.  Good day.  Exactly. 
[00:20:30]  Good day for the show.  We are on the field.  We're the fucking players.  We're the people that the people came to see.  You make the deals in the fucking back office.  You do it.  You think fucking Derek Jeter has to sit down and listen to fucking shit?  I'm Derek Jeter.  If Derek Jeter made one billionth less.  Would you sign my picture?  No. 
[00:21:00]  Leave me alone.  If Iraq comes in, can we at least sing him happy birthday or something?  We have to sing him happy birthday.  Sam's back.  He's not happy.  How's his voice today?  We love him.  Well, I think his voice is fine, but he's not really talking.  How old is he?  How old is he today?  I think 40.  I'm not sure, though.  Oh, my God.  I almost believed you.  No, he's still a tater.  What's a tater?  A little tater talker.  Okay.  Yeah.  He's like 32, I mean? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Somewhere around there.  He's still young.  You know, he's staring at the speaker right now as you guys are talking with this look  on his face that's like his jaw is slightly agape and he's got like anger in the side  of his eyes.  And it's sort of like the look expresses of all the bullshit that I've had to deal with  on this fucking show.  This is in his look.  It's not me.  This is him.  This is what you read.  Of all the bullshit that I've had to deal with on this fucking show, they're really going 
[00:22:00]  here and on my birthday.  But honestly, as a member of the show, you're supposed to stick with other members of the  show.  It's not like it was in a private meeting.  If you're in somebody's office and you see something, that's a little bit dicey.  But if you're in a meeting and we're all sitting there and you see something and you don't bring  it to the air, it's your job to do that.  Management should be happy and proud.  Proud that if anybody saw something would go to the other members of the show because 
[00:22:30]  it's camaraderie and it's a team.  And there's a difference between talent and management.  Always has been.  But it's also...  You can't be our pals!  You have to just so we can talk about it on the air.  It is what we do.  It's like four hours a day of material to fill.  We can talk for a half hour about the meeting now.  It's funny.  That's what we do.  We certainly can talk about my PUD picture for at least ten more minutes.  PUD?  I love your PUD photo.  Hey, Ant, you should be screaming I'm a freaking radio star from Mars. 
[00:23:00]  From Mars!  That's right.  That's right.  Read the instructions.  Ant falls asleep.  Read the directions.  Right.  Read it.  Read the directions.  The scoreboard doesn't lie!  The scoreboard doesn't lie!  While Roland was sitting next to E-Rock in the office, he said, well, if you're not going  to go in, I'm going to bring in the cake anyway because I'm hungry.  Ah, see?  Now we got cake.  He's ready to open the cake.  Roland's a sweet boy.  Look at what Roland did.  He brought in nice stuff for E-Rock.  Roland brought in cake and Nana Pudding.  From Magnolia. 
[00:23:30]  Roland's a good boy.  That fucking banana pudding from Magnolia is ridiculous.  I never fall asleep during management meetings.  You don't.  You're actually wide awake and belligerent to the entire thing.  He's so belligerent.  I don't know how they haven't fired you yet.  God bless you.  Roland, he just doesn't care.  He doesn't care.  I'll tell you how they have it because guest after guest rolls through the shithouse.  Yes.  All this bastard is good.  Yes.  I've witnessed Roland falling asleep in no less than three meetings.  And every time...  Has it been jotted down? 
[00:24:00]  Well, no.  Every time a member of management will specifically say, Roland, you here with us?  And he'll shake himself.  He'll open his eyes.  And then he'll cross himself and say, just praying for your family.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Because HR, you need to do prayer.  You can never get in trouble.  It's impossible.  Jesus.  That's a great thing, though.  Religious beliefs.  I know.  It is.  It's in that handbook.  What three or four psalms in a row were you reciting to yourself? 
[00:24:30]  Here's the thing.  The meeting...  I thought the meeting was good and we got some stuff done, but...  It was a really long meeting, though, man.  An hour and a half?  I don't know how long it was.  But it worked.  It's like, if that's what it was, if Ant don't...  It's like, who cares?  It worked.  It was okay.  Everybody kind of contributed.  It worked.  It's like, the meeting was fine.  It worked.  Like, why care if Ant did this or Ope did that or I did this or it fucking did...  Who gives a fuck?  The meeting was good.  It doesn't...  Like, they shouldn't care.  It doesn't give a chance for ideas to really blossom and hatch.  An idea comes out and, like I said, it's baby-sealed. 
[00:25:00]  It's just thwacked over the fucking head immediately.  There's no, like...  There's no, let's figure out how to make this work.  Ideas that are contributed go through the lawyer filter first before they even come  out of people's mouths now.  We're so fucked up with trying to skate shit past lawyers.  Wait, you have a special sense.  You picked up all that while sleeping.  Oh, believe me, yes.  What is it, like sonar?  I'm like a shark.  I'm a shark.  Even when sleeping, they gotta keep swimming. 
[00:25:30]  I was swimming.  Shark swimming.  And what's that campaign in New York?  If you see something, say something.  See something, say something.  That's all Iraq was doing.  Or I think we should have cake, so we can all be happy again.  Yeah, give him some cake.  All right, let's...  Why don't you go down and see if he's coming out?  Get him back here.  Should we sing to him?  I mean, it is his birthday.  Yes, we'll sing to him.  We'll sing happy birthday.  And he has to realize this, though.  It'll be the best happy birthday ever sung to a human being.  I would go out on a limb for Iraq.  I will try to stay awake, to talk to them long enough to tell them Iraq didn't do anything 
[00:26:00]  wrong.  Yeah, he's trying to...  I'll try, if I don't nod off.  He's trying to show you he's a true soldier there, right?  He is.  You can never get Iraq in trouble first.  Look, it even says happy birthday, Eric.  Iraq.  Did you spell birthday right?  We don't do that around here.  Birthday.  It's always a birth...  F, birth.  Why am I going to eat cake?  It's a birth day.  I've worked so hard on the tradition.  Oh, I know it is.  What I would suggest is blow off the cake, blow off the cake for the pudding.  If you're going to eat anything today.  I like the fact you think I have the willpower to make that decision, as opposed to realizing, 
[00:26:30]  as we all do, that I'm going to shove one piece of each into my fucking pig mouth.  Sam is actually running down the hall without Iraq, so that just can't be a good sign.  That's not good.  We have a lot to talk about today.  Sam.  Oh, he's shaking his head.  It got worse.  Things are not good.  What happened?  It got worse.  It did good there.  I was giving him fucking...  It did good.  Well, maybe he's got something else.  Special dispensation.  I asked him if I had delivered his facial expression well, and he nodded.  And then I said, so, you know, they kind of want to sing to you and offer you a piece 
[00:27:00]  of cake and all this.  Something tells me he shook his head.  Well, he didn't make eye contact, and with a quiver in his voice of how angry and upset  he was at this whole thing, there was a quiver.  He said, without looking at me, tell them I respectfully decline.  Whoa.  It's the good guy cake.  The banana pudding.  Maybe there's other stuff.  The banana pudding cake?  He has to be mad about something else.  It's not just this, because nobody got Iraq in trouble. 
[00:27:30]  He's not in trouble.  He knows that.  That is a vat of banana pudding.  I know.  I know the baker.  Yeah.  Hi-yo.  Enzo the baker.  I am Enzo.  They see Roland coming.  They're all happy.  Yay.  Yay.  Put that addition on the house.  Wow.  Damn it.  For your producer.  For your producer.  Yes.  I make it for your fodder.  For your fodder.  For your fodder.  Why am I holding it?  I just wanted to feel the weight of it.  It looks really heavy.  It's an elephant baby.  It's so nice.  That's a lot of pudding. 
[00:28:00]  It's the best shit you can do.  Yay, pudding.  Yay, pudding is right.  Oh, boy.  You guys are going to enjoy the filter I put it through.  It's the best shit you can eat in New York City right there.  Fuck the cake.  It's all about the pudding.  Vanilla cake with banana pudding.  But he's not lying.  Yeah.  Vanilla cake with banana pudding.  Oh, my God.  It rules.  Put a dollop.  Good combo.  Do you put a dollop of it on?  A dollop?  I don't know.  That's good.  We have a nice big knife to cut the cake with.  That's good.  That's what we need.  Yeah.  Get Iraq in here to cut the cake with it.  Is there anything else you want to offer, Iraq? 
[00:28:30]  A nice horrid scene in here.  No, I think something else is bugging him.  Well, I think this is sort of like...  Because it's his birthday?  Well, like yesterday, he had a rough one.  What happened yesterday?  Well, we spent about an hour making him do voices until his voice had heard.  And when I was sending Audible, I realized that just that morning, we had actually done  in the first hour a whole bit with music and everything just based on the mayo truck  thing, making fun of him.  So that was about an hour 15 of yesterday's four-hour show. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, shit.  Smashing Iraq.  He's been sick for four days.  Wow.  Today's his birthday.  And you guys fucked him.  So I want to say he should not be fucked on this.  I don't want Iraq getting in trouble.  It's a team effort here.  We are all on the same team in this studio and in the production room.  Let me give an example of this type of thing years ago.  From what I understand, when Tom Chiasano would go in and give speeches to people or 
[00:29:30]  whatever, Howard would have people tape him and they would...  Oh, yes, yes.  Look, and that would go on the air.  That has to.  It's like you can't get somebody in trouble on the fucking...  on the show for saying something that they saw.  And this isn't...  I thought something...  A member of the show, you can't.  This isn't secret corporate...  No, you can't.  ...information that anyone's given out.  It's a meeting.  You can't.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, the other side of that, it's been very obvious these guys don't want to play with 
[00:30:00]  us.  Yeah.  On that level.  They don't want to play.  Come on.  If you don't want to be fodder for this radio show, I really do believe you've got to  move on to another channel.  And if we're going to take the shit on their end, we'll be just fine.  Then they've got to take the shit on our end.  If we're taking the shit on the fucking corporate side, then you take the shit on the fucking  on-air talent side.  Take a little fucking ribbing.  You can join all the people that walk these halls that used to work with us that don't  even fucking look at us anymore.  Exactly.  The thing is...  I get a polite hello from people that, holy shit, it's like, really? 
[00:30:30]  We did a lot of great radio together.  But now it's just down to a polite hello.  Yeah.  Not how you're doing, it's just a quick hi.  It's a supermarket aisle nod.  It's unbelievable.  I'm like, really?  We used to do lunch two to three times a week talking about shit.  Eric Logan was the fucking...  He had Scott Greenstein's job here.  I mean, he was the fucking boss.  And he would be on the phone with us, and our listeners would send him cock photos.  And he was certainly good at what he did.  Oh my God, right?  He wasn't a sap.  I mean, Eric Logan was a fucking very bright guy. 
[00:31:00]  But he was okay with fucking around with the show.  It's like, you kind of got to do that to be a part of this.  No, if you want, just find him at Harpo, because he works for Harpo now.  And just send him cock pics.  I'm sure he misses them.  But they kind of have to...  They kind of have to put up with shit from, like, you guys.  Yeah.  Because you are the talent.  But the producer...  Like, we're not the talent.  No, see, they've got to understand.  You guys are in management.  You've got to understand, our production team is not your fucking minion and management. 
[00:31:30]  They're not to be treated that way.  Like a fucking...  Like a cubicle-sitting fucking sap.  No.  They're in here.  We have ideas.  We have fucking ideas.  We have talks with each other about bits and stuff.  And it's done in a fun atmosphere.  Say organically.  Organically.  Thank you.  I like that word.  That is a good one.  Organically.  Because they thought that was an organic minion.  Not something to be greenlit.  Or blue-skied.  Minutes. 
[00:32:00]  Minutes.  With your reading fucking minutes, you need a gavel and someone that takes a mic at  a podium and bores people.  I think at the next meeting, anyone who is not on the show should be required to wear  a white wig.  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  And start the meeting saying, hear ye, hear ye.  Oh, enough.  It's just not a fucking...  It's not a meeting that's conducive to me staying awake out there.  Or to like... 
[00:32:30]  To batting shit around.  It needs this...  It needs more...  To be more relaxed and less fucking structured and corporate with the fucking legal pads  and fucking...  Ugh.  Knocking shit down.  Do you like when they suggest ideas?  No!  Why?  They had some good ones.  They had some good ones.  I would know.  I didn't sense that.  My spidey senses weren't picking that up during my fucking...  You picked up all that other stuff with your sonar. 
[00:33:00]  I pick up more emotion than I do actual, you know, ideas.  But at least we got some stuff done.  Yeah.  So did I.  I didn't have to nap when I got home.  It was great.  I was able to get right into my afternoon.  And believe me, I got to work out today.  So I ain't fucking sitting for nothing.  I am going through...  They might want to talk to you about a couple things.  There ain't no talks going on today.  It's me going home, napping, getting up, and pushing some steel, motherfucker. 
[00:33:30]  Charlie Sheen?  Like Charlie Sheen.  I'm an F-18, bro.  Like the song?  Oh, please not like this song.  Did he really say that?  Oh, God.  I fucking love this song.  Thank you, son.  I'm an F-18, bro.  The Troy Kwan song?  There it is.  Where are we at with E-Rock?  I even tweeted a picture, like, minutes before Charlie Sheen did.  And people think that he did it first.  You did that first?  Yes.  What picture?  The one in my kitchen.  The winning picture?  The one in the kitchen.  Yeah, that was you first?  I saw yours, and I saw Charlie Sheen. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, it was like seconds before.  It's an amazing fucking coincidence.  I'll tell you that much.  What's your pick?  Yeah, I didn't see your pick.  Maybe he's following you.  There.  Oh, it's hilarious.  That's my pick.  It does look just like Charlie Sheen's.  It's fucking, it's right there.  We're holding it up.  It's like fucking...  You got the angle wrong a little bit.  No, Charlie Sheen did.  No, believe me, that's perfect.  Is it?  No, you really studied it?  The camera should have been over to the right a little bit.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, believe me.  It should have been over to the right just a little bit.  But still, it's very similar. 
[00:34:30]  And then I showed off my watch.  It tells Warlock time.  Did you see that?  And he had his ring in his, but mine is a little different.  See, that's my watch.  Why?  There's a gun.  Well, he has a ring.  I didn't know you were...  Wow.  One with Charlie Sheen.  My watch tells Warlock time.  Oh, we got the plates and the spoons and the forks and the napkins.  Oh, we're just missing E-Rod.  Should I go check on him?  Yeah, check on him.  Yeah, go check on him.  That's all we want to see him.  Oh, we played the great F-18 song.  You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just 
[00:35:00]  look at their loser lives.  And then they look at me and they say, I can't process it.  Well, no, and you never will.  Stop trying.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  No, I'm an F-18, bro.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  No, I'm an F-18, bro.  Enjoy the show.  Newsflash, I am special and I will never be one of you.  This is me not on drugs, bro.  I will destroy you in the air and I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. 
[00:35:30]  The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning, you know.  The first one's free, the next one goes in your mouth.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  I'm an F-18, bro.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  I'm an F-18, bro.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  Wait, can't process it.  Losers winning.  I'm an F-18, bro.  Goodbye.  There you go.  Great song.  I don't get it. 
[00:36:00]  Charlie.  We got the Charlie Bray coming up.  Winning.  He made a national catchphrase in a matter of hours.  Winning.  Winning.  Everyone just goes, winning.  That's the big one.  Winning.  And at the rate he was getting Twitter followers.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  Unprecedented.  It really makes you feel good about yourself, doesn't it?  That's great.  I think within the first eight seconds, he had more followers than all of us combined. 
[00:36:30]  It was crazy.  That's great.  What's he got now?  About half a million?  He's over half a million.  Well over 600,000 last I checked.  He hasn't even been on Twitter a day.  He did have a funny one about Chuck Lorre.  608,000?  608,000 in less than a day.  Did you read that one chick that he's got on, that he's following?  Because he's only following 16 people.  One chick was like, look, I don't know Charlie Sheen.  I never met him.  He's a creep.  And ew.  Because she's 20 years old. 
[00:37:00]  She's like just some young chick.  And Charlie decided to follow her?  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  One of the 16 fucking lucky few that he follows.  And she was like, I don't even know this guy.  She seems a little disgusted with it.  No?  Not good.  It's still not good.  We did pretty good that for New Rock.  Does he know there's luscious cake here?  He does.  Wow.  Wow, that must really, things are not good.  He's torn.  He said yesterday is not a factor.  I didn't think it would be. 
[00:37:30]  Iraq, his very thick skin would be in teased.  He could take being teased.  Iraq.  But he said, I apologize, Iraq.  He said he'll talk to the concerned parties off air.  Off air.  He'd like to talk to you offline.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq. 
[00:38:00]  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  And nothing.  Winner.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Where is he?  Oh, wow.  Sam ran down and he's already running back.  He's running back.  He was down there for less than a second.  And here he comes back in again.  That was good, right?  We did the chant.  Things are not good. 
[00:38:30]  Still?  I thought he would at least be smiling at the chanting.  That's why I ran down there.  Yeah.  He's, uh...  He's still got his head down, just rubbing his temples.  Oh, boy.  Like he's, uh...  But we can't talk about this off air.  That's...  Stressed and upset.  We don't really know how to act off air.  It's kind of strange.  Well, I think he feels...  Uh...  He's angry.  Iraq.  What's wrong?  I don't know.  He's betrayed.  Oh.  You having, like, feelings of, um... 
[00:39:00]  Inadequacy?  I'm not good.  Oh, Iraq.  No, you're good, Iraq.  You're good.  We all know that.  You're good.  You're good.  It's just for the show.  It's not helping.  Yeah, this segment won't help.  Thank God that button doesn't work.  Oh.  Come on.  I know.  That's a good one.  That's a terrible one.  Yeah, this isn't going to help things.  No.  No.  I mean, if he were...  He probably deleted it.  Oh, he's not...  And he probably...  You heard Danny say that.  No, no.  He's not going to like that Danny's taking shots.  He's a team player. 
[00:39:30]  He proved that.  He proved that.  He really did.  He proved a lot yesterday.  And he should be proud of it.  He's a warrior for this show.  He proved it.  A Vatican warrior.  A Vatican warrior for this show.  A Vatican warrior, right.  Uh, against the forces of Evil.  He's part of the F-18 team.  Yes.  Although I think the look on his face, uh, makes it seem like...  Battle fatigue.  He's, uh...  He kind of feels like you guys are just pumping him up because he's upset now and he sees  through the bullshit.  No, no, no.  There's no bullshit here.  Sam, could you ask him...  There's no bullshit. 
[00:40:00]  Could you ask him if he appreciated the chant, at least?  Because the chant was pretty good.  Just ask him directly.  Yeah.  Okay.  Cake makes you happy.  And cake makes you happy.  Okay.  Yeah, cake.  There's cake.  There's cake and pudding.  Lovely cake and pudding.  You must really be mad.  Hooray.  Hooray for E-Rock.  Hooray for E-Rock.  Hooray for E-Rock.  This is great on his birthday because there is a rebirth, I think, of E-Rock.  It's a team player.  One that isn't, uh, uh, afraid.  He's fearless. 
[00:40:30]  Doesn't need to be afraid.  That's right.  Are you eating cake already?  I mean, he's weird.  Okay.  He doesn't need that.  Don't worry.  I thought you were eating cake.  Believe me, I would dig into his birthday cake in a second.  Oh, Sam's already back.  Oh, God.  Sam is running back and forth.  That didn't take long.  Sam.  What's the, uh, oh.  Wow.  He didn't like the chant.  Sam shakes his head and does the...  Things are...  Things are bad.  You're not even being sarcastic.  Like, this is not good.  No, no, no.  He's not at all.  You're not even being sarcastic as well. 
[00:41:00]  He's not at all.  Well, I went in.  But did he enjoy the chant?  I asked him.  I said, did you enjoy the chant?  And I asked him in a way as in, you know I'm about to ask this.  And he looked up from his head that was in his hands and said, what?  And I realized the room was silent.  Oh, no.  And I said, you're...  Do I have the show on?  He goes, no, I haven't been listening.  Oh, boy.  But did he tell me he did the chant?  He wasn't.  It started off nice and slow and it really...  I think it was a perfect chant. 
[00:41:30]  Oh.  He, uh...  And they're saying E-Rock equals winner.  Yes.  Charlie Sheen's going to start saying E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  He's not hearing this because he's not interested in listening.  Oh, my God.  That is true.  When Sam comes back, it looks like Jerry Lundegaard coming back after he had to talk  to the manager about knocking some dollars off of the true code.  Well, E-Rock doesn't usually do this.  I want to come back with good news.  I want to, you know, sell you guys on this, but... 
[00:42:00]  I mean, he's...  You want a piece of cake, E-Rock?  What, are you kidding?  Are you kidding?  He's not in a good space.  No?  Really bad.  I don't even remember why he's mad at this point.  Because if I don't remember, I don't think the boss is going to know.  I think they would definitely remember.  They're going to remember.  Oh, for sure.  This is creativity.  Can I acknowledge you're even shaking your head up and down?  Oh, no.  I had something in my eye.  I apologize.  God, yeah.  These guys are really scared.  With the thing...  Say or do anything. 
[00:42:30]  Because you're lumping everybody in there.  I mean, Roland and me have no problems with anybody in management.  I love you.  Yeah.  Here's the problem.  Here goes.  Here's the problem.  These guys are scared.  This has been at least 40 fucking minutes of us doing a break that people are compelled.  It's compelling.  It's got some humorous things in it.  It keeps a storyline going between us and management and stuff.  I'm talking about the listener's point of view.  40 minutes, which you would kill for in a meeting to be able to come up with a legitimate 40 minutes of radio and all agree on it. 
[00:43:00]  And it's something that can be put on the air and it's entertaining and shit like that.  And that's what happened.  That's what came out of the meeting.  Look.  Look, it worked.  The first fucking break in the morning is something that came out of the meeting.  Yay!  E-rock.  E-rock.  Yeah, he's not listening.  No, he's not.  He's not interested in any of this.  So what's the problem?  Can we just drag him down the hall? 
[00:43:30]  He's heavy.  He's very heavy.  Oh, Jesus.  I mean, I'm slight of frame.  That's all I'm saying.  Oh, no.  He's very heavy.  All right, well.  I mean, maybe all of us, but definitely not one or two of us.  But it's his birthday.  Yeah.  That's his probably.  That's his.  You saying, but it's his birthday.  That's what he's saying, but it's my birthday.  Ask him if he's going home.  I'll go ask him that.  Because now it's uncomfortable.  Now it's uncomfortable for everybody.  The pudding's going to get warm and ruined.  I know.  He's ruining everything. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, the pudding stays here.  He's ruining it.  E-rock goes.  Oh, he doesn't.  And the cake's going to melt.  I want cake.  You're going to have to wait for E-rock.  I don't.  E-rock.  I won't see him no more.  I thought I'd have cake by now.  I know.  Roland's all upset.  I thought I'd have cake by now.  We're all hungry for cake.  Cake was on the fucking schedule already.  Oh, my God.  Sam's already coming back.  Wait a minute.  Why so fucking fast?  He's got to.  Oh, wait.  Or is. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, now he went back.  Now he's.  Oh, wow.  He's going past.  He's going like into.  He's in management.  He's in management territory.  He's in the management area.  That's enemy territory you just ran into.  Are those things the office are beautiful?  He's crazy.  He's like Kowalski.  What goes on way down there?  Is E-rock missing?  Is that what he's doing?  And now Sam's running back.  Is he going to hurdle the fence?  Is E-rock not in the office?  See, that's the fence.  We should make him do that.  Oh, my God.  That's the fence between us and management.  He would go ass over tea kettle.  Unfortunately, you guys have the first two offices over the fence. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  You're close to the border, though, man.  You're fucking right on the 30th parallel.  You certainly are.  Wow, now Sam.  No man's land.  But Sam's running around this place.  I think he's looking for E-rock.  Probably the bathroom.  Yeah.  Oh, could be.  Throw water in your face.  Hearing weeping from one of the stalls.  That echoey bathroom weeping.  You hear the overnight guy taking a massive shake.  Miss Crabtree, something's heavy on my heart.  You mean the animals that work here after we leave? 
[00:45:30]  Yes.  They leave the bathrooms completely destroyed.  Oh, God.  It's like a monkey cage.  What the fuck's wrong with you people?  I go to the 37th floor.  Shit on the wall.  37th floor is clean.  What the fuck is wrong with these people?  Pee all over the seats.  Piss everywhere.  The seats.  What are they doing?  The floor.  What the fuck is wrong with you animals?  It's sickening, dude.  What show do you do?  I would love to know.  Can't keep our own bathroom clean.  Yeah.  Do that in the fucking subway, you animals.  We live here for a few hours every day. 
[00:46:00]  They really are disgusting.  It's unbelievable, actually.  I never thought I had to do the girl thing and build a nest to fucking take a dump.  Oh, God.  In this joint, you certainly have to.  And get some Rogaine for your pubes.  Holy shit.  How many could fall out?  What do you got?  The mange?  Yeah, the pubes are falling out everywhere.  How many pubes collect on the fucking front of a toilet?  Holy mother of Christ.  Sam?  I did get one laugh out of him.  Oh, good.  Oh, yeah.  Because I snuck up on him at the urinal.  I found him at the urinal and just walked up behind him and said, they want to know if 
[00:46:30]  you're going home.  Which he laughed because he didn't know I was in there in the bathroom with him.  Oh.  Okay.  That's good that he laughed.  He did.  But then the smile quickly left his face.  And he took a while.  He thought about it.  Yeah.  And then he said, tell them I'll return to my post in the next segment.  All right.  And then I asked if he was concerned about the fact that he was ruining the banana pudding.  It was going to get warm.  Yeah.  And he said he very much appreciates what Roland did for him.  He specifically said what Roland did for me. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, boy.  What about what Ant did for him?  But he said, I'm really not concerned about the banana pudding at this point.  Oh, wow.  And you know things are bad.  That's big.  Why would he lie?  He's lying.  I know.  The banana pudding is from all of us.  But who could speak openly about what's going on here?  Is this going to be a real problem with management?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Why?  Why?  Why?  I want to know why.  Are you allowed to talk?  Are you guys...  Well, I'm not allowed to say what I mean.  I don't have any problems with anybody.  So I voluntarily don't have much to say. 
[00:47:30]  Well, I guess we're asking you for your opinion.  Is that fair?  I don't know.  Will you get in trouble for stating your opinion?  Well, I think that management would probably not like certain messages being delivered  to you guys, to air talent.  It's one thing if you guys are shitting on management, but they don't necessarily feel  like it's helpful.  He wasn't shitting on management.  But they don't think it's helpful for us as the staff to give you guys ammo to shit on management. 
[00:48:00]  I shouldn't have known what was going on on management's fucking little notepad when  it comes to me.  I think E-Rock's a hero.  That's one of the most noble things E-Rock's ever done.  Are you feeling okay?  Yeah.  I like this.  I think it's one of the most noble things he's done.  And they'll say...  Oh, God.  It's probably...  They'll feel like it's an invasion of privacy because they were...  Privacy?  ...outwardly saying something, and then E-Rock was failing you, and he was kind of eavesdropping 
[00:48:30]  in a way, and, you know...  It's not eavesdropping.  What?  It's, you know...  Cover your fucking notes.  No, it's not eavesdropping because if it's there and it's seen, that's eavesdropping  is if they went into the office and did it, but if it's in an open meeting and you're  writing it and it's seen...  That would be like eavesdropping if he was walking past the office and the door's open  and they're yelling something and you heard it.  It's not like you got a cup to the wall with your ear on.  But like they would say...  It was in plain sight for E-Rock to see, I guess.  If you guys came in and were shitting on the meeting today because you didn't like the meeting, 
[00:49:00]  none of us would be in trouble, but if somebody were giving you ammo to do that on our staff,  they wouldn't see that as helpful whatsoever.  And why would they?  You suck.  What do you mean?  I'm just giving you what you asked for.  This fucking guy knows how to play perfectly right down the middle.  I'm giving you the facts.  You'd be a perfect politician.  It's the facts.  That's all I'm here for.  Pick a side!  I'm here for the facts.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a reporter.  It goes with his racial backup.  He can't really pick a side. 
[00:49:30]  But he's fucking...  I think we need a hero song for E-Rock.  Yeah.  I mean, that's a great idea.  I would go Mariah Carey because that's the obvious one.  Maybe Enrique.  Enrique has a hero song.  I could be your hero, baby.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was a good one.  Plus, it's a little more romantic.  There goes my hero.  But a little Enrique.  It'll make E-Rock feel a little sexy, too.  Because it's Enrique Iglesias.  That is true.  And E-Rock, we're going to play the hero song for you.  I mean, he was not going to hear it.  Anthony called you a hero today.  He is.  He came to the table. 
[00:50:00]  How about Bette Midler?  There's a great hero song she sings.  Oh, that is good.  Enrique's good.  Way beneath my feet.  I don't know Enrique's.  Oh, you'll know when you hear it.  It's a sexy song.  It really is.  Oh, that one.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, he really came to the table.  Go, go.  We got it?  He came to the table.  Oh.  And go.  Oh, you want to go Bonnie Tyler?  Fucking, hey, yeah, let's go Bonnie Tyler.  All right.  Now we're talking. 
[00:50:30]  E-Rock, we play this for you today.  This is E-Rock's song.  That's right.  Anthony called you a hero.  This is it.  He's going to pick you.  Oh, this is a good one.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  This is all about E-Rock right now.  He's going to feel like you guys are making white.  No, no, not at all.  This is great. 
[00:51:00]  I mean, it's a good song.  Oh, who's not pumped?  Oh.  Here she comes.  Running out of a flaming house.  I'm going to go see if E-Rock's motivated.  Yeah.  She's dancing out of a burning house.  Wow.  Isn't there a white night?  Right.  See, you walk out with a fucking burning frost.  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  This is his song.  When he goes to the deli.  He sings this at the counter.  That's not helping.  He needs a hero.  I need a hero. 
[00:52:00]  Wait, wait.  Sam, we're playing the hero song.  Yeah.  I made a huge mistake.  What else can we do?  I made a huge mistake.  I made a huge mistake, guys.  You were holding your head when you came in here, didn't you?  I know.  I made a gigantic mistake.  What happened?  Oh, no.  It looks like the hero song.  I said, they're playing a hero song for you.  Oh, no.  Look, look, look, look, look.  No, I know his song.  Look, it's right here.  I told him.  Yeah.  And I said, they're playing a hero song for you.  Let me just turn it on for a second. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, no.  And I clicked on the speaker, and immediately, there was one note of this song, and he heard,  this is what he sings at the counter.  And I went, okay, I shouldn't have turned that on, man.  And he just shook his head.  Oh, no.  I made a huge mistake.  Is he listening now, though?  No, I turned it on.  I turned it on.  Hero.  Hero.  I made a hero.  Hero.  Hero.  This is not a hero.  Oh, God. 
[00:53:00]  This is good.  I mean, you heard the references to the hero sandwich.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe it's a song.  Maybe a different hero song.  Another hero song?  Yeah.  Maybe a different one.  That one was making light.  Watch Enrique's.  I don't know what Enrique's is.  Watch Enrique's.  All right.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Is it coming?  Well, this is the subway sandwich.  There's no hero in this song. 
[00:53:30]  Well, it refers to the sandwich.  Yeah, that one.  And, I mean, he goes to the subway all the time.  He loves it so much.  How about Metallica?  Hero of the day.  They played the $5 foot long song.  That's not going to make him happy at all.  Does he go in and say, give me $20 worth?  All right.  That'd be four feet of sandwich.  Four feet of sandwich.  Sam, I got something for you.  It's a big hero.  Okay.  Go down the hall and ask him what hero song he would like to hear.  For himself.  That's a great idea.  That's good.  For himself.  You're getting quite the workout today there, Sam. 
[00:54:00]  I love it.  With his funny little feet.  Clown shoes.  Clown shoes.  Look at them.  They're sideways when he runs.  Yeah.  Pigeon toad.  He needs orthotics.  Or are they opposite a pigeon toad?  I don't know.  I don't know what it's called.  Oh, wait.  When they go outwards?  No, they're not pigeon toad.  Pigeon toad points in.  Yeah, when it's in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  He's in the office.  This is the longest he's been in there.  All right.  This is good.  I think the ice is starting to break.  Okay.  And go. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, bro.  No, I just...  The sad part is this is a real problem.  Oh, I know.  Oh, I know.  This is a real problem now.  But it shouldn't be.  Of course not.  And I have to now do something so it's not.  All right.  He's shaking his head as he runs.  I have to throw myself on the grenade.  Oh, boy.  For E-Rock.  Sam.  What did...  He doesn't want a hero song?  The songs have brought things from bad to worse.  Oh, no. 
[00:55:00]  But they're paying tribute.  But we asked him to pick out his favorite heroes.  I asked him what...  David Bowie Heroes.  Thank you, Coke Logic.  I asked him what hero song he wanted to hear.  Yeah.  And he waited.  And then he looked up and said,  I don't fucking care.  Whatever gets them to 10 o'clock.  Oh, shit.  I mean, if I can make a suggestion.  Wow.  At least now he knows our mantra.  I think he's talking for every single listener.  That's our credo.  Wow.  I know he just became a hero to the listeners. 
[00:55:30]  I know his favorite show is The Greatest American Hero.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, shit.  So maybe, believe it or not, if we were to play that.  Remember that?  Between that and banana pudding.  What is it?  Yeah, yeah.  It's going to weaken.  I mean, Travis Danny did play the $5 foot long song.  Which I told him.  That probably didn't help.  No, I told him thinking it might.  It didn't.  Yeah, yeah.  We're just trying to keep it light in here.  The Greatest American Hero is really good.  It sure is.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  This is all about E-Rock.  And E-Rock truly did love this show. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, he got pictures with the cast.  He proved that he was a hero yesterday.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Oh, do you?  Did you guys know it's E-Rock's birthday today?  Happy birthday.  Yeah.  Right.  I think it's...  Believe it or not.  That's great. 
[00:56:30]  Hopefully, this will lighten the spirit.  Yeah.  Where could I be?  Seinfeld.  Believe it or not.  I'm not home.  Seinfeld joke.  Yeah, a little bit.  Something to laugh at.  Something to lighten the mood.  Yeah, just like the light of a new day.  Nothing's happening.  I mean, it is an uplifting song.  Yeah.  There's only one song I can think of that might help. 
[00:57:00]  Really?  There is one song I can think of.  Um...  Believe it or not.  It's a certain...  Ultimate Warriors music?  No.  Oh.  But it is in the same genre.  It's a certain type of man.  Oh.  Oh.  What?  It's a certain...  That is true.  I think he likes that one.  I mean, it's about different things he likes to do.  Oh.  You know, I don't know.  Believe it or not, it's just me.  Could it be?  A little...  Yeah, I like that one, too. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, that's a good one.  E-Rock, you are a hero.  Okay, let's try a different song.  I'm an ass man.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yes!  I'm an ass man.  He came in, he kicked ass.  Yeah!  He kicked ass yesterday.  Well, that's not the only thing he does with asses.  Oh.  You know what else he does with asses, right?  Well, let's hear.  Love him.  Let's love him.  Kick him.  Kick him.  Kick him.  Kick him. 
[00:58:00]  Shovel.  Shovel.  Stick him.  I guess he sticks him.  Oh, flunk.  Yeah.  You guys watch some asses.  Uh-huh.  Yeah!  Is this working?  Yeah!  Is he coming down the hall?  I don't see him.  Oh, no.  I don't see him.  He kicks ass.  Well, now we have another bit with the hero.  No ending.  I know.  E-Rock understands this.  We need an ending to this.  Okay.  Now, don't put the comma after ass. 
[00:58:30]  There's no comma in the title of this song.  See, he's an ass man.  If you put a comma after ass, it changes the entire...  ...uh, meaning.  Yeah.  I know.  Oh, God.  No.  Well, he said he'd be back on his post for the next segment.  So maybe the trick is...  Take a break?  ...start the next segment.  Maybe go in and like, oh, did you hear about Charlie Sheep?  By the way, E-Rock.  And they go, you know...  That's true.  Could you close the curtains?  Because he's going to have to walk, like, awkwardly by the studio to get back to his post. 
[00:59:00]  We'll have to look at him.  Yeah.  I just want to look up and see him back all happy behind him.  Yeah.  No, you're not going to look up and see him back all happy.  No, you won't see that.  No?  Nope.  Will he talk to us after the break?  I really hate bits that don't have an ending.  He might talk to Jim.  What?  Maybe.  I mean...  Oh.  He'll talk to Jim?  Maybe.  Yeah.  He's really mad at me.  Did he go down the hall and give it a try?  I didn't want him mad at me on his birthday. 
[00:59:30]  I feel bad.  Jimmy's going to go down the hall and try.  I feel bad now.  I mean, yeah.  Jimmy's a good diplomat.  Why not, right?  I'll give it a shot.  Jimmy's going to give it a shot.  Because we kind of need an ending to this.  Yeah.  We've got Dominic coming in today, by the way.  Keep your hand flat.  Lombardozzi, right?  From the wire?  Yeah.  And Roland is sampling the banana pudding.  Oh, my God.  I'm hungry.  Couldn't wait.  You couldn't wait.  Roland's been standing in here for the whole segment.  Not because he cares about E-Rock. 
[01:00:00]  He's just staring at the pudding.  No, just testing the temperature.  How is it?  Is it good?  It's delicious.  So good?  I bet that's really fucking good.  All right.  Jimmy is...  How many calories is that one spoonful?  Jimmy's outside an office.  Oh, okay.  That's supposed to be ours that we've never been in.  Is he trying to find...  Yeah, we don't even...  He just walked in the office.  He just walked in.  Your desks were replaced with couches.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How long ago?  Two years ago, more or less.  Yeah, two years ago.  We haven't set foot in there.  That's our green room for everybody. 
[01:00:30]  I was like, this is your offices.  Oh, my God.  It's a little far from the studio.  Well, whatever.  All right, Jimmy.  We don't need an office, I guess.  Jimmy, back down to the studio, then back back in.  All right.  He's chatting with E-Rock, who's a little...  He's mad.  A little post-traumatic.  Well, because we had a meeting yesterday, and he might have saw the word, Anthony, sleeping  on a piece of paper that... 
[01:01:00]  Yellow legal pad or something.  ...to take the minutes of our meeting.  The minutes.  To create a meeting that Ant slept through.  Will that be brought up next meeting?  Probably.  That we brought up as early as today.  So E-Rock's...  As early as today.  So E-Rock's mad because that will now cause major problems between him and management.  And that's what we're in the middle of right now.  That's accurate.  Yeah.  So he stormed office post a long time ago, and we've been really trying to get him back  on the team. 
[01:01:30]  And now we're down to the point of Jimmy talking to E-Rock.  This will probably result in a private meeting, and then a wider meeting to let everybody  know that, listen...  Are you kidding?  Well, just so everybody's on the same page of, okay, here's what our opinion on the matter  is.  Leave.  Leave the staff the fuck alone.  But people do need to know where management is coming from.  No.  No, they don't.  They know.  Everyone knows.  No one's enlightening anybody here. 
[01:02:00]  But this is what we do.  This is our job.  We go on the air, and we talk about our lives.  Yesterday, in the meeting, was part of our lives.  We never signed a confidentiality agreement as far as these show meetings go.  Everything is fair game.  Roland, you want to know where they're coming from, right?  I do.  It's in their best interest.  Thank you.  Oh, Christ.  Will it be brought up that E-Rock was put in a tough spot?  He sees Anthony sleeping on a piece of paper that management is writing on? 
[01:02:30]  I never slept on a piece of paper.  Yeah, he's so uncomfortable.  I would be.  It was a comfy chair.  What was E-Rock supposed to do?  Hold that info back?  Knowing that certainly would make for great radio.  It's in his best interest.  I mean, it would probably be in E-Rock's best interest to keep his eyes, as we learn in school, on our own papers.  If you have an issue, what are you reading?  Oh, no, no.  There's just, it's just something that we know.  It's been past policy that management thinks if you have an issue, before it goes on the air, it should go to them. 
[01:03:00]  And be completely unfunny-ized.  Un-funny-etized.  Have an unfunny-ectomy.  What if they can resolve the issue?  Have an uninteresting fucking ectomy.  And then, you know, and then maybe take it to the air.  But when you take it to the air, don't mention this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this.  So then we're not mentioning anything.  But they might be able to resolve the issue before it becomes a bigger thing than it has to be.  You know what I mean?  Sam, more importantly, me and Ann are so upset, we might have to leave early today. 
[01:03:30]  Well, I mean, I'm thinking 9.30.  That is true.  I understand that you guys are upset.  I would like it if you stayed until 10.  It's extremely stressful.  I know.  And I mean, you've gone over.  To be in the middle of this.  Apparently, Opie, when we leave here, it's like when the U.S. troops left Saigon.  Like, everything's kind of in order and organized chaos kind of a thing.  But the second we leave, I think the North Vietnamese, and you know who that is, just storms over the line and just takes over. 
[01:04:00]  So you guys are safe as...  Well, and treats everybody like, you know...  Since working at Sirius, I have yet to encounter any forces that I would call enemy forces.  Of course, asshole.  Of course.  Right.  So you guys are safe as long as we're around.  I feel safe all the time because...  Oh my God, that's so funny.  I mean, I don't...  Well, if I can move my apartment here, I think we can work out a deal.  Yeah.  I don't think there's anything that we wouldn't feel safe about.  We just, you know...  Jimmy's having a hell of a powwow in there. 
[01:04:30]  I told you it wouldn't work if we said Jimmy.  He's got the star power that you rock.  Jimmy does have the touch.  He's got the touch.  This is the end.  What's wrong with what?  I don't get this.  The apocalypse?  Oh, I see.  Yeah.  Charlie Sheen watching this.  It wraps it all together nice.  E-Rock, Charlie Sheen, management.  Yeah.  Charlie Sheen making catchphrases.  I mean, it was like, E-Rock, really, his opinion was, before today, I can't believe with  all the bullshit that I have to put up with on a daily basis. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  And then today, it was, it's my birthday.  I can't believe it's gotten this bad.  It actually got worse.  It got worse.  Yeah.  On his birthday.  On my birthday.  I'm 40 years old today, and this is...  He's not 40.  I don't know how old he is.  I don't have his birth certificate.  He is a fan of The Wire.  We can have Dominic give him a hug or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll have him sing happy birthday to him.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, Jimmy's really talking to him.  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  Roll it with, like, a piece of cake while he's waiting.  Oh.  We can't cut it without the birthday, boy.  We can, like, cut it.  Is this a song about when there's only one slice of pound cake left?  See, this is the end, and you're like, my only friend, the end.  The end.  I like the middle pieces better.  Yeah.  More flavorful.  Well, this is what we're going to have to do, because it's a real situation.  It's a nail-biter.  Jimmy's in the middle of seriously talking to Iraq.  It's going to be a while.  So we'll take a break, and Jimmy will, yeah, or Danny's running. 
[01:06:00]  Danny's running back down.  He's doing that slow jog.  Yeah.  And then maybe he's got a little recon on what.  He's doing what black people do when they're crossing the intersection.  Crossing the street.  And they want to make it look like they're running, but they're really not.  They make believe they're getting out of your way.  Any recon on what's going on in that office there, Danny?  Yes, Danny.  I just kind of wanted to see what was going on, but Jim's just chatting with him.  He's just working him over.  He is.  Okay, so.  Did he look a little more relaxed? 
[01:06:30]  I didn't peek in.  I don't think they saw me.  I just kind of wanted to see what was going on.  Yeah.  All right.  So after the break, we'll get an update from Jimmy.  All right.  Hopefully we bring this whole thing back together.  And you guys luck out, because if Jim's talking to Iraq during the break, you don't have  to deal with him.  That's true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  We got Dominic Lombardozzi, I believe.  That's how you say his name.  Right from the wire?  Yeah.  He worked with Jimmy on...  Bored to Death.  Bored to Death.  Right.  So he should be in soon.  We also have an internet enthusiast from 1993 who got it all wrong. 
[01:07:00]  I saw this yesterday.  It's all wrong.  It's really good.  He thought he knew what the internet was all about.  And then we got Stinky Vag Stingers from Derek.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, wow.  No.  They're fun.  They're fun.  I don't know what it is.  Oh, you don't know what it is?  I don't know what it is.  Well, it's not just to, like, play.  It's like, I think he wants him so that you could just kind of fire him off if Stinky  Pussy comes up. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, no.  I want to just play him.  It was wacky time in the recording studio yesterday.  Let's get ready to smell some vaginas!  Yeah, these are words just plain.  Derek.  I like that.  What?  I don't know.  Derek gets funny sometimes.  He's got all kinds of ideas.  Derek's alone in there like, hurt.  Is that a fly noise?  Well, that's when things smell. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Flies.  Jerry, you gotta smell these stinky vaginas.  Oh, I don't want to smell these stinky vaginas!  See, Derek's master plan was to just have you play these randomly.  Yeah.  Like when you were talking about the, uh, the, uh, I'm sorry, the, uh, smelliest, uh,  the deadliest snatch contest.  Oh, you mean the contest that's not a contest.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The show.  The deadliest snatch show.  Oh, yeah, the show, the show.  So, the deadliest...  Stinky pussy! 
[01:08:30]  But you have to understand, though, that, like, Derek, he's laughing hysterically, you  know, wanting me to do all different kinds of stinky pussy, you know, voice lines.  And then he just, his eyes kind of go dead, he kind of just, his whole face drops, and  he just stares me dead in the face, and starts going, Jerry, there's all these stinky pussies  everywhere, and he's laughing to himself, and he fucking sat there, and made, I'm like,  I can't do a good Kramer, and he just goes, just do it, just do it, and he made me do  that, then he wants, then he wants, he wants to have a whole series now of all of these 
[01:09:00]  sitcoms that talk about stinky pussies, so he's got, like, a whole list, and apparently  I have to do this sometimes.  We had a brainstorming set, bringing up different, uh, sitcom characters.  From Mork and Mindy to Steve Urkel.  Was management in there for that brainstorming meeting?  No, but they're invited to next time.  Stinky Vagina!  These are great!  I like it.  Absolutely.  All right, uh, a break, and then Jim Norton will give us an update on the E-Rock situation. 
[01:09:30]  What an ugly start to the show.  Also, we got the latest Charles Sheen stuff, and, uh, I don't know, lots of things.  Bigger than ever.  Big show today, big show.  I'm Bob Slidell, this is my associate Bob Porter.  We're trying to get a feel for how people spend their day at work.  So, if you would, would you walk us through a typical day for you?  This is the dumbest radio show ever.  It's just people eating and trying to prepare food and making fucking dick jokes.  Would you be a good sport and indulge us and just tell us a little more? 
[01:10:00]  We have no boss or prepared material.  We don't know shit.  It's, it's gigantically ridiculous.  It's a fucking clusterfuck.  What would you say you do here?  Uh, nothing.  It's a fucking abomination.  There's no way to spin it.  Useless.  Go on.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  There goes my hero. 
[01:10:30]  Watch him as he goes.  There goes my hero.  Sergeant Mary.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  And of course, Jim Norton, who's got a big show this weekend.  Thank you, man.  I do.  In the Montclair, Wellmont Theater. 
[01:11:00]  But you know, I screwed up last night.  I was supposed to be on Hannity tonight.  I'm on tonight.  I apologize.  Because I didn't go to Motorhead the other night so I could sleep so I wouldn't be tired  yesterday to do Hannity.  I'm so mad at myself.  I totally fucked up.  You got all confused.  Dude, I was so fucking confused.  Yeah, because you said you were on last night, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, and I turned it on and fucking Al D'Amato was on.  Oh, I wish I was on last night.  I love D'Amato.  Where the fuck is Jimmy Norton?  Al D'Amato.  Al D'Amato.  No wonder Sean called me.  He's running out of people I have on that show.  Al D'Amato and then Hugh Hefner's daughter. 
[01:11:30]  Okay.  And then that black guy.  That's always on?  Yeah.  Which one?  The black Roland?  Whose name is Roland?  No, I don't think it was him.  That guy looks like Roland.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm on with the guy who got fired from NPR, I think.  Juan.  Oh, right on.  Whatever his name is.  I already forgot his name.  Yeah, but I like him.  We sat here and stood up for him.  Did you take the R word pledge, guys?  Oh, God. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, the Roker.  That word should be wiped out.  Roker.  You saw that Al Roker took the R word?  Somebody did.  What's the R word pledge?  Retard, I guess.  Don't say retard.  Yeah, don't say retard, I guess, is the new one.  And I'm sorry for everybody that has a retard out there.  What if you have an older car and you've got to adjust the timing?  Huh?  You've got to retard the fucking...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You can't use that word for any circumstance?  What if you work here?  Yeah.  Well, that's...  You've got to take the R word pledge.  There's a website and everything. 
[01:12:30]  And Al Roker made sure he tweeted and said, I took the R...  You saw it too?  Yeah.  It made me ill.  Oh, God.  I took the R word pledge.  You know what it is?  He's a weatherman, desperate to be something more.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, he's trying.  But, you know, in Al's world, epilepsy's cool, so...  That's funny.  You make jokes about it.  Look, I think you've got to joke about it all.  But, you know, you can't be an epilepsy guy...  Picking shoes.  ...and then get in a little trouble for the epilepsy joke and then have to apologize.  And now you're goody-two-shoes about the R word. 
[01:13:00]  It's ridiculous.  And his whole thing about it is, oh, well, you know, I was just talking and it came out.  Oh, but if somebody else does that on radio, they should be fired.  Fuck him.  Look, man, having a kid like that, it's got to be hell on earth.  Now that I'm a parent, I understand...  Let's be a chore.  You know, just having a normal kid is a lot of work.  I can't even imagine having one that's...  Needs work.  ...mentally challenged.  Whatever we're supposed to use.  Retarded is okay.  To say a kid is retarded is okay. 
[01:13:30]  Somebody is retarded.  Right.  We know what that means.  Because then mentally challenged will start to be...  It'll become the...  What does it mean?  That covers the gamut.  They're trying to make people not as ugly.  They're trying to make people's feelings different by softening certain words.  And it's just...  And then we just...  We as a whole...  Collectively.  Yeah.  We'll just come up with other words.  That's what humans do.  The new R word is respect.  That's what I'm reading over there.  Cool.  Well, Al Roker took the pledge. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Thank God, Al.  Standing up, right?  That's great.  Stood up and took the pledge.  Is there like a pledge?  Is there an oath?  I don't know.  Or do you just say, I pledge an oath.  There's an oath.  Do you stand up and...  Yeah.  I don't know.  God damn it.  Why is this cake and pudding right next to me?  I can't handle it.  We're waiting for you, Rock.  To give the word that we could, you know, dig into his birthday gifts. 
[01:14:30]  I want him here.  We should...  What's that long thing?  That's the knife.  That's a big fucking knife.  Where's Roland?  That is a big knife.  Roland's probably getting our guest.  Oh, did he go again?  Oh, Dom.  Okay, yeah.  He's not in for until 8 o'clock, Dom.  Iroch, you all right?  Thumbs up?  All right.  We got a thumbs up.  Iroch.  Happy birthday, Iroch.  I'm sorry, Iroch.  Iroch, you don't have to talk, but let me tell you something.  You were put in a very tough position yesterday.  Yeah.  Because of course you got to tell us about that.  Yeah.  Of course you have to. 
[01:15:00]  And then when you tell us that, of course we got to go on the air with it.  It's impossible not to.  There's a line drawn in the sand between...  It really is impossible.  He was put in a really tough position yesterday.  Yeah.  That's impossible to not bring that to our attention.  All right, Roland is breaking out the knife.  Oh, shit.  But we can't do it without Iroch.  He has to cut the cake.  He doesn't have to talk.  It's a birthday tradition.  Yeah, I want Iroch to cut.  I want Iroch to be a part of this.  Did you ever just talk with Iroch?  We talked a few minutes.  I understand why he's upset.  I mean, I understand. 
[01:15:30]  But the reality is there's a line drawn in the sand between the show and management,  even the guys we like.  Like, I honestly do like those guys.  But there's always going to be that line drawn in the sand.  Yes.  Because we are on opposite ends.  And we are going to be adversaries at times.  They're full.  Well, that's...  Wow.  And a guy like Iroch is a guy that you want on the side of the show.  Exactly.  That's one of my biggest pet peeves.  Some of these guys don't understand what this show's all about and that they have to be...  They have to be beat up for the enjoyment of our listeners. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  We've been doing it since day one.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I just want to...  This is the fucking...  The knife that Kardashian hid.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  That is filthy.  Iroch's birthday!  Iroch's birthday!  I don't know.  It just...  It doesn't care.  It doesn't care.  The morning mashup doesn't care.  Rust stains?  Not right.  Iroch, you're right.  I'm not Iroch.  Let's get some cake.  That's a good cake.  Let's have some birthday cake.  I'm sorry, Iroch.  I didn't...  Eric.  I don't want to put you in an awkward position.  I'll call America today.  We didn't do it to kill you. 
[01:16:30]  We were doing it because it made for good radio.  I understand that.  And, you know, I'll do whatever it takes to make sure you are cleared of any charges.  Pass it around.  Yeah.  Yes, the cake around.  You've got to have a cake, Iroch.  Have everybody get a look and then cut the cake.  Roland, help out here, Roland.  You're standing there like a cake voyeur.  Look.  See, that's a nice birthday present.  I heard it's your birthday and that you're in a lot of trouble.  Oh, shit. 
[01:17:00]  That's good.  While he's holding a knife like Michael Myers.  Real smart.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  It's a big bowl of cups.  It's a big bowl of cups.  This is a perverted little display here of food.  Why?  Yeah, it really is.  Well, this is perverted.  Banana pudding?  Yes.  It's a giant...  Magnolia?  But it looks dirty in this big vat here.  That's how they sell it.  Doesn't it look like a big bukkake?  Yeah, a little vat.  Yeah, they should call that lucky girl.  I'll have some lucky girl, please.  And they throw it on your face with a spoon and we enjoy it.  I would like that a lot.  Why is Iraq twirling the knife? 
[01:17:30]  And why did you give him a knife, Roland?  Because he's wondering how many years he'd get.  Yeah.  He'd be out.  He'd be able to get rehired.  I'd plunge this.  Plunge.  How about...  That is a knife that's made for plunging.  Should we sing to Iraq?  I think we should sing.  Iraq just plunged it in his cake.  Ah, that's a good slice.  I just want a small piece.  Right there.  Oh, watch your waist.  Yeah.  You've got to have a small little piece there, Jimmy. 
[01:18:00]  Iraq, will that first hour make the countdown this weekend?  I'm sure it will.  Oh, sorry.  Huh?  I'm sure it will once Sam builds it.  You've got to be mad at Sam the most at this point.  No, I think he's pretty pissed off at me.  He'll be okay.  Yeah, I'm not 40, but...  I do apologize, Iraq.  A little bit.  Not much.  I'm trying to watch my...  Jesus, Jimmy.  It's as good as I thought it would be.  Is the cake good, Iraq?  It's delicious.  It's just...  You can smell cake in here now.  Oh, there's fucking...  Ooh, I didn't know that. 
[01:18:30]  I thought that was just pudding.  That's good enough.  There's bananas and a little bread in there.  No more, no more.  Banana bread pudding.  Oh, my God.  Thanks.  Some of that fancy bread that tastes good.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy, Jesus.  I'll try a little bit.  Just a little bit of the...  Yeah, that's good.  Oh, you...  It's really good.  No more.  I thought you said you were going to take a little bit.  Come on, eat it.  I'm just having a little taste.  A sliver for my tongue.  Very small.  Very tiny.  How's the cake?  The cake part? 
[01:19:00]  Delish.  Fucking good.  It's got banana cream pudding on your mouth.  Oh, there you go.  You know when the last time I had dessert was?  Yesterday.  Yesterday.  Sorry.  Let me try some of this banana-y stuff.  Bananas.  You know...  I want some of that pudding.  Oh, my God.  This is insanely good.  Dude, you've got to try a sliver of cake.  A little sliver.  I don't know if they've got magnolias on Long Island yet.  Oh, magnolias.  They certainly should. 
[01:19:30]  All right, all right.  Well, this is stupid good.  Yeah, that's good.  The whole show just stopped for cake.  Well, everything stopped for cake.  Anytime is a good time for pie.  This is so good.  Oh.  Thank you, Roland.  Where's our guest, by the way?  Smile on your face.  It's like...  Oh, I thought it was 7.30.  Yeah.  I was stalling.  We need to get some shit done.  No, that's not...  Oh, my God.  We got this thing from 1993.  Internet enthusiasts getting it all wrong. 
[01:20:00]  It's worth playing today.  Oh.  What happened?  I'm just enjoying this.  I was declining cake and pudding.  Oh, you're really watching your weight, huh?  Yeah.  I don't want to be fat.  Fuck that.  I don't either, bud.  It would be so easy just to throw this away and not eat it.  How do you do that?  How do you do that?  You want me to do it for you?  Um, uh...  Yeah.  Sometimes you need someone to just do it.  Definitely.  I'm not having the rest.  Can't waste it.  Can't wait.  Because you work out enough.  It's not like you don't work out, dude.  You're in the gym fucking three, four days a week. 
[01:20:30]  I sure am.  I ate half of what he gave me.  Yeah?  And not even because of the weight issue.  There is so much sugar going in there.  Not really.  Yeah, there is.  I know.  Not really.  That is unbelievable amounts of sweetness and goodness.  It's angel wings.  But if my dad was still alive, he would say it's healthy.  Because look, there's bananas in it.  Bananas.  You're eating fruit.  You're getting some of your...  Getting some fiber.  Fiber and potassium.  It's called vanilla wafers, not bread.  All right.  Is it wafer-y? 
[01:21:00]  Yes.  All of that's those vanilla vanilla wafers thrown in there, too?  Then why do they call it the banana bread pudding?  That was so good.  No, the banana bread pudding is different.  It is different.  Oh, God.  Look, E-Rock's got a smile on his face now.  This stuff is instant smile.  E-Rock, this will bring you right back.  That's what I call it, instant smile.  This will bring you right back from...  I'll be smiling if I had cake.  Yeah.  Yes.  So good.  It's fantastic.  Taste that.  Oh, my God.  It's so good.  I...  I...  What a lovely combo. 
[01:21:30]  Have a couple of spoonfuls and then throw the rest away.  Even Kenny, who never has...  Kenny, try the pudding.  It's not for me.  It's for the mash-ups.  Oh.  Why don't you have a piece of cake, Kenny?  You never enjoy...  Enjoy yourself, Kenny.  Why don't you have...  You work...  You're in the gym every day.  Why don't you have some bread pudding and a piece of cake?  Enjoy some pudding.  Be one of the guys.  Instead of just the queer.  I am queer. 
[01:22:00]  What do you think, Kenny?  You gonna try...  Or is this for the mash-up?  No, that's a mash-up piece.  That's a mash-up piece.  Oh, mash-ups.  He's not.  Mash-ups?  Mash-ups.  How about they get their own cake?  Kenny is not gonna have a piece of cake.  What do they have to do?  They say records and then talk...  I never got any fucking mash-up cake.  Yeah.  That's a good point.  Mash-up never gave me anything.  Oh, damn.  Radio war.  Radio war.  Let's get in another radio war.  Fucking motherfucking mash-up. 
[01:22:30]  All right.  Here's a little audio from...  93, right?  93.  93.  John Allen says it's a modulated anarchy.  There's an interesting kind of restraint that you find.  I mean, there's not a lot of cursing or swearing.  There's not a lot of personal cuts.  There's not a lot of put-downs that one would expect to find.  There's not, you know...  There's not screen-fulls of, you know, go to hell.  It's just surprising.  Not really.  So, the kind of liberation is mixed. 
[01:23:00]  It's interesting because one would think, if you're anonymous, you do anything you want.  But people have, in a group, have their own sense of community and what we can do.  The thing, though, that I'm always left with when I leave is this overwhelming desire for people to be rooted.  And the only way they feel rooted is through another person.  And if this is the way, the only way, maybe, that they can talk to somebody, this is how they'll do it. 
[01:23:30]  Wow.  Whoa.  Well, he sure underestimated people.  Overestimated people.  No, I mean underestimated the potential to be pricks.  Yes.  Goddamn.  You don't see screen-fulls of, you know, go to hell.  By the way, there was a YouTube video that the audio had come from, and every time he's talking about that, it's nothing but YouTube comments.  Oh, fuck you, you soggy, my ass.  Yeah, yeah, the video's really funny.  Yay, pudding! 
[01:24:00]  Pudding!  Wow, that went through you quickly.  That pudding.  Is it going to smell all banana-y?  Yes, it will.  Blotto 98 from Detroit writes,  What is this, Housewives of SiriusXM?  I'll just have a little piece.  Only a small bit.  I'll watch my weight.  Fags.  We really are fucking homos.  Oh, just a smidge for me.  Smidge.  Fucking assholes.  A tiny little slice.  It's very good, though. 
[01:24:30]  It's well worth it.  It is good.  You've got to just take a couple of spoonfuls and then instantly throw it away.  Where are we at with Charlie Sheen?  So he started his Twitter account last night.  Started tweeting.  Finally.  When are we going to be sick of him?  By Friday?  Yeah, I'm thinking he's got about the end of the week.  He's so overexposed.  By the end of the week.  But it is fascinating how a man can coin catchphrases that are now world-renowned, at least country-renowned, in a matter of hours. 
[01:25:00]  Did he gain 100,000 followers since we started the show?  How many has he got?  I think so.  Didn't you say 603?  Probably.  He's almost at 700,000.  Yeah, he'll have a million in no time.  Yeah.  But it's everybody's just watching him fall apart and enjoying it.  Yeah.  He is very quotable right now, but it's like, Jesus.  12 tweets.  697,712.  Wow.  What are some of the tweets?  He's just replying to a lot of people, it looks like. 
[01:25:30]  Retweeting someone.  Yeah, he did the picture.  And then the pictures, yeah.  All right.  Well, he was on 2020 last night.  2020.  But as the days go by, it looks like he's trying to stay off the drugs and alcohol.  He's not being as crazy, I think.  Yeah, he doesn't look completely out of his mind.  Some people are saying this is all just a ruse, a clever work.  No.  I don't think so either.  He's a good actor, but I mean, no. 
[01:26:00]  No, that would be way too, that's taken a major chance.  But he went from, you know, he did have a very popular TV show, but not everybody watched it.  Like, I didn't watch it.  A lot of people I know didn't watch it.  It was just there.  They didn't need anyone else to watch it.  No, no.  The ratings were fucking huge.  But for him personally, he went from a guy on that show to like, he is front and center on the news.  Everyone's talking about Charlie Sheen.  He is, but they blew eight episodes.  You don't blow a fucking third of a season on a ruse. 
[01:26:30]  If it was one episode and they didn't do the last episode, I would go, maybe.  But fucking eight episodes is a shitload of advertising money.  This is going to work out in everyone's favor in the end.  Because they're going to all come back together.  Yeah.  Maybe.  I really do.  Believe that, yeah.  I don't think there's enough shit that went on that'll keep them from getting together and making this work.  He's still forgivable at this point.  Yeah, yeah.  Nothing's unforgivable.  Not to make it about us, but look at the shit we have said and done over the years. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  And we ended up working for the same guy.  Same company.  I know this is a much bigger situation, but you make a really good point that nothing really crazy has been said.  Nothing too crazy has happened.  He talked about his drug use.  He says he's not doing drugs anymore.  So what are you going to do?  There have been plenty of people that have done drugs, not done drugs, and then get their jobs back.  Right.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, he looks healthier than he did a mere week ago.  Yeah, a couple of days ago.  I guess, though, they took his kids.  Is that what I heard? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, that's the latest.  The mother came in with a restraining order and shit.  I mean, when a stripper, when a porn star is fucking raising your kids, I think you start kind of maybe second guessing if it's a good idea.  But he seems like he's not all in when it comes to his kids anyway.  Well, he was, you know.  He seems like he says he's a good dad and all that, but as long as he gets to see him here and there, I think he's fine with that. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm just guessing.  Norm MacDonald's tweet last night was, hey, great looking kids, Charlie.  Congrats.  Frats.  Like he's just posting pictures of his kids.  I was watching a program on the TV.  Some of his tweets are just.  Norm MacDonald.  Norm MacDonald is hysterical.  MacDonald.  They say it like that.  MacDonald.  MacDonald on Twitter.  MacDonald.  He's killing it. 
[01:28:30]  Charlie Sheen on 2020 last night.  So Charlie talks about why he likes porn stars.  We win so radically in our underwear before our first cup of coffee.  It's scary.  People say it's lonely at the top, but I sure like the view.  Sheen calls them his goddesses, and their exploits have been fodder for print, TV, and online tabloids around the world.  It's no secret that you have an affinity for porn stars.  Well, I mean, wow.  Listen to that statement.  Why?  Well, look at what they do.  Look at what I do.  Duh. 
[01:29:00]  What a dumb woman's question.  What a dumb woman's question.  Why?  Why do you think, idiot?  Duh.  Because they're hot and they fuck good.  What a dumb question.  I could see if it was like if he was banging fat chicks.  You like fat girls.  Why?  That's a real question.  Yeah.  Break it down to the basics.  You don't have to answer that question.  I just put a dumb question, but he answered it right.  They do.  Look at what I do.  Duh.  You know, you say duh, but I don't get it. 
[01:29:30]  What is it?  It's exciting.  It's fun.  And you already know what you're getting before you meet him.  Because you've watched them.  No, because I'm guessing right.  Well, of course.  What's not to watch?  They're the best at what they do, and I'm the best at what I do.  And together, it's like, it's on.  Sorry, middle America.  Yeah, I said it.  Sorry, middle America.  Yeah, but he's right.  I said it.  With that one, he's right.  It's like, why do you think a guy likes porn stars?  Mm-hmm.  Stupid. 
[01:30:00]  That's the fucking, the news.  What are you doing?  Because they're not used to that type of honesty.  No.  They're not used to someone's going, oh, you like porn stars?  Why?  Oh, well, you know.  All apologetic.  He's just like, what?  Duh.  Winning.  Winning with his catchphrase.  Charlie talks about the last time he took drugs.  Tell me about the last time he took drugs.  Last time I took drugs, I probably took more than anybody could survive, you know?  What are we talking about?  How much?  I don't know, man. 
[01:30:30]  I was banging seven-gram rocks and finishing them, because that's how I roll.  I have one speed.  I have one gear.  Go.  How do you survive that?  Because I'm me.  Because I'm me.  I'm different.  I just have a different constitution.  I have a different brain.  I have a different heart.  I have a different, you know, I get tiger blood, man.  But does even tiger blood prevent an OD?  You don't worry that you're going to die when you take that many...  She had to do that voiceover.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God, I hate how they put this shit together.  Blur, blur.  Listen to that again.  Yeah, it's awful. 
[01:31:00]  You didn't need that.  Just ask the next question.  Even tiger blood prevent an OD?  You don't worry that you're going to die when you take that many drugs?  Dying's for fools.  Sure.  When you look back at the last time you used drugs, are you disgusted with yourself?  No.  How could I have done that?  I'm proud of what I've created.  It was radical.  You're proud of that party moment?  Of course.  Why wouldn't I be?  Why would you be?  Because I expose people to magic.  I expose them to something they're never otherwise going to see in their boring, normal lives.  We just all suck. 
[01:31:30]  I don't like her outrage.  No, that fake outrage.  That fake outrage.  It's fake outrage.  Shut up, you dumb fucking trying so hard to have a moment.  You're not going to nail him because he's telling you the truth.  It is phony outrage.  She's trying to be a bit tough.  Yeah, shut up.  Ross Kay, I apologize ahead of time.  And truly, I like helping the listeners.  Yes.  He's from OVX, and he writes, what's Sheen's Twitter?  Now-  Jim Norton. 
[01:32:00]  Now, I would understand that question if you've tried a few things-  And it didn't quite work.  And you can't really figure it out, then maybe you'd go to us for a question like that.  Yeah, yeah.  But did you try Charlie Sheen before you wrote that?  I need to know.  What's wrong with you?  That would be the first place you would go, right?  Yes.  Charlie talks about his kids.  You have these beautiful, beautiful children.  Yeah.  Do you ever worry about them and the things that you've been through and how it'll affect them? 
[01:32:30]  I mean, I can worry about it, or I can say, hey, kids, your dad's a rock star.  Look at his experiences.  Look at what he survived.  But, bang, there are some of your lessons, but the real lessons are going to be in the future.  And what makes you a good dad?  Everything.  Everything.  Next question.  I mean, is there anything in particular that-  It's nobody's business, man.  This has been me and my kids, you know?  Wow, she sucks. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  She really does just suck.  Scrambler, Chicago.  I don't have time to go to the phone.  Two eight balls of Coke at a time is what he was describing.  Was he?  Two big rocks?  I guess so.  Charlie says he's going to sue.  Stopping this show is costing an estimated quarter of a billion dollars all around.  It's going to cost them a lot more because they're on a battlefield and they let their emotions and their ego, basically they strapped on their diapers. 
[01:33:30]  And so, um, they're in breach.  They're in radical breach.  And sorry, guys.  You screwed up.  Are you going to sue?  Well, I mean, wouldn't you?  I don't have a job.  I got a whole family to support and love.  And, uh, people beyond myself, people a lot more important than me, are relying on that money to, uh, fuel the magic.  And you know what?  He's not as crazy as everyone thinks because, uh, he hasn't really taken shots at Les Moonves, the main boss.  No. 
[01:34:00]  Uh, I don't, I don't think he's taken one shot at all, matter of fact.  I think he referenced that Les Moonves was in his kitchen.  Yeah, I don't think he's.  And Les Moonves was our boss.  Yeah.  Back when we were at the, you know, K-Rock.  He hasn't taken that shot.  And the shots, like you said, he took at the creator and all were, you know, they could, they could patch that up easy.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's why I think.  So he's.  Eventually.  So he is.  So he is pretty smart.  Yeah.  Because if you really wanted to completely blow this up.  Right.  You say anything about Les Moonves, he's, he don't give a fuck how much money a show's making. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  He goes right to the stockholders and go, look, this is over.  Sorry.  We're getting rid of him.  We're getting someone else.  And they didn't officially say it's over.  It's all just sitting there.  Yep.  And this is going to be patched together, Ed.  You're right.  The, uh.  Mm-hmm.  And he's, he knows that he lost the gig and that bothers him.  I think it should bother him.  It's like, there's a lot of money on the fucking table right there.  That's why I honestly don't think he lost that.  That's a lot of fucking money.  That's why I honestly don't think he lost that.  But he might, when they cancel the show for the remainder of the season, that might have 
[01:35:00]  bothered, freaked him out a little bit.  That would freak me out.  I mean, no matter how much money you're making.  Mm-hmm.  When the network just says, you know what?  Fuck this.  Eight episodes.  Done.  Right.  You know that you've cost, or that they've cost a lot of people a lot of money.  It's like, who's gonna pay those guys, the fucking, the grip guys, and the fucking, all  the behind-the-scenes guys?  It's like, you do feel for those people, because you know them all those years.  They're paying some of those guys.  Yeah, they are gonna pay those guys.  Are they all gonna get full pay?  Good.  I don't know if it's full.  Is it full?  I heard, like, they're paying them for four episodes, was it?  Oh, I thought it was for the remainder of the season. 
[01:35:30]  They might have to pay those guys.  Yeah, they're paying them.  But I think, yeah, I think they were, like, they were getting a little worried, and so.  Of course, yeah.  It's a big relief.  How about the other actors who have fucking eight, I mean, again, that still sucks when the  dude, we got a gig, what are you doing?  Because in the end, it was, you know, Les Moonves' decision to stop production.  So, and then Charlie knows that.  So, if he really is fucking pissed, he would go right, right at Les.  Yeah.  He has not done that.  But he won't do that.  Because he knows that in his brain, you know, this could be all fixed. 
[01:36:00]  After everyone calms the fuck down.  Still reparable.  One more clip.  2020 last night with Charlie Sheen.  Are you afraid to die?  Have you ever been afraid to die?  Well, who isn't?  It's, it's the greatest trip, because they save it for last.  You know, deep.  Yeah, it sucks that I have to do it, too, but I don't, I don't know, heaven and hell,  whatever.  I just think it's different dimensions.  You know, I think it, just walk through different doors.  Who knows?  I don't know.  What will your tombstone say? 
[01:36:30]  Something dot com.  I don't know what it is yet, you know.  What?  I don't know what it is yet.  Stupid question, though.  Yeah, I know.  She's a hack.  She's working for 2020.  Yeah.  Really?  Awful.  Awful.  All right.  We should break right here, because I think Dominic's going to be on soon.  We got Dominic Lombardozzi.  Thank you, Jimmy.  What is he promoting, you know?  It's a show called Breakout Kings on A&E, and he was on The Wire.  He was Herc. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, he was.  And we did War to Death together.  He's actually become a buddy of mine.  Yeah, he's a great guy.  Very cool.  It'll be good to meet him.  Stay there.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony Show.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  We got Dominic in the studio.  I don't know how to say your last name.  I think I'm messing it up. 
[01:37:30]  Lombardozzi.  Lombardozzi.  Well, look at me.  Do I look Italian?  Yeah.  Yeah, like from the northern part, maybe.  The northern part, maybe?  Yeah.  Which mic are you using?  Oh, that works.  Okay.  And he comes in and pats Jimmy on the back like you're old friends now.  Yeah.  You know, a couple actors.  Work together.  Yeah.  Men of similar ilk.  I was so nervous.  I told you I was supposed to do Boy to Death with a guy, and I guess he got another gig or  whatever.  And I got in the van, and I just see Dom there.  I'm like, what are you doing here? 
[01:38:00]  Why is Herc sitting in the fucking van?  And then he's like, we're working together.  I'm like, that was kind of cool.  But I would have panicked if I knew beforehand.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was awesome.  We get to talk to a lot of guys, but the Wire guys, we get nervous, man.  I don't know why, because we love that fucking show.  You guys are rock stars to us.  Either that or you're afraid you're going to get sticked up.  Yeah, well, certain members of the cast, yeah.  Yeah, no kidding.  I'll talk to a bunch of you, and we get a little starstruck, man.  I mean, seriously, the best show that was awesome. 
[01:38:30]  Well, you guys gave us a lot of love, so.  Yeah, but you guys didn't need it.  And we're just amazed that the show didn't win any awards.  We're obsessed with that, but.  So were we.  Yeah.  Oh, you were, right?  It's annoying, right?  Yeah, it has to be.  Well, in retrospect, you look at the show, and you're like, well, how did the show never  even get a writing nod?  Yeah, I know.  It happens.  It's fucked up.  You think that's because it was done in Baltimore or it didn't follow what they wanted it to  follow as far as ideology?  I can't figure why that wouldn't be rewarding. 
[01:39:00]  Was it too real?  Oh, yeah.  We were in shadows of some really big shows.  You know, it was a really good time for television.  You know, you had the Sopranos.  You had Six Feet Under at the time.  You had other good network shows.  It's just, I think Jimmy probably hit the nail on the head.  You know, the Baltimore crew.  There it is.  You don't know how these things work out.  Yeah.  It's frustrating, though.  Yeah.  It's, uh...  I think everybody from the Y that's been on has said the same thing. 
[01:39:30]  It's like, eh, it's frustrating, and then they all have their own ideas as to why.  A lot of, uh...  I think it's more than just a lot of good shows we're on, because that's a good show.  I think it is something political going on.  It absolutely is, because there was a lot of great shows, but fortunately...  If it lost a writing thing to the Sopranos, I wouldn't agree with that.  But I'd go, all right, the Sopranos is the Sopranos.  Whatever.  But to not be nominated is a fucking statement from Hollywood.  Especially, you know, for a guy who is as creative and talented as David Simon. 
[01:40:00]  You know, his book, Homicide.  He wrote on Homicide.  A lot of people don't know about The Corner, which is sort of like the prequel.  Yeah.  Like The Wire.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.  That show was on for a while.  Who was in that?  A lot of the couple...  I don't know if Dutton was in it.  A couple of guys from The Wire were in it.  They had different roles.  Yeah, Charles Dutton.  Oh, was he in it?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was in that one.  Yeah, that was a sick fucking show, man.  That was some crazy shit happening on that one.  It was like six episodes, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It didn't run long, but I remember watching it and going, like, holy shit, this is some fucking nasty stuff here. 
[01:40:30]  It's like Dead's Baltimore.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember when we were first starting up The Wire, and I went there, and I was doing research with some of the cops, and I was like, wow, this looks like Fort Apache in the 70s.  Yeah, yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's some hardcore areas.  We took the Amtrak down there a few times.  Oh, and the train's just rolling through?  Yeah, and we were allowed to just keep going and looking out the window. 
[01:41:00]  I'm like, you actually stopped and walked around?  What are you, crazy?  The fire department must be busy.  Everything's burnt out.  You're actually scared the train's going to break down between fucking Philly and D.C.  Don't fail.  You would look out the window down the streets, and you would see one car in front of one row home, I guess, and the rest of them were boarded up.  And that's why David had to create The Wire, you know, to let everybody know what was happening in these small American cities.  You know, that's why it's such a socially conscious show. 
[01:41:30]  And he was a real reporter.  And those are real characters.  Like, I didn't know Avon Barksdale and Omar.  They're based on real people.  And those guys are still alive, which is pretty amazing.  Jesus.  Yeah.  That happened.  And he would have them.  You know, he would have them come to the set.  They're really friendly.  Ed Burns, who is one of the writers and creators of the show, put half of these guys away.  And they come up to him, and they're shaking his hand.  And, you know, it's like, wow.  It's great.  I guess they know it's your job, right? 
[01:42:00]  Like, if you're a drug dealer, it's a cop's job is to fucking put you in jail.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was good that I said that.  It's part of the game.  Yeah.  Sometimes I want to sound like I'm street knowledgeable, but I'm really not.  I took what you guys put there.  I just kind of added one layer to it and acted like I came up with this definitive thought.  It's called being a fraud, which I am.  A fraud.  And then you guys, of course, worked together.  Which was great.  And Jimmy would come in here, and he thought you were just the greatest man.  Yeah.  I remember coming on, you know, my first day, and actually it was a wardrobe. 
[01:42:30]  I had to come in for a wardrobe fit, and I found out that Jim was doing the part, and  I'm a big fan of his stand-up, you know?  I've been following him for a good while.  He's a funny little fellow.  Yeah.  And we just hit it off pretty easy, man.  You know, working, everything flowed pretty good.  We had a really good time.  Yeah, everybody's nice there.  The whole fucking crew is nice.  But everybody, the amazing thing was to watch Ted Danson and those guys. 
[01:43:00]  None of them wanted any part of me.  Like, they would nod politely.  But him, all they wanted, they all wanted to walk up to him and talk about the show.  That show.  It's like, the actors were fucking, were very impressed with you.  Much more than they were with other more famous actors.  They didn't care about that.  But you were the guy that the other actors wanted to talk to.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All of them wanted to touch somebody from The Wire.  Cool resume stuffer there that, The Wire, definitely.  You know, it means a lot when you get it from your peers, you know?  Yeah.  And they respect it, you know?  You know, me and Jim would talk about episodes, and you remember when this happened, and you 
[01:43:30]  remember, well, what was this guy really like?  I was a fucking teenage girl.  He was sitting in his trailer, we're going over lines, and I'm like, did Omar really die?  He's just like, right?  Oh, you child.  Oh, it was such a fucking pansy for a week.  Just the way they took out Omar was, that's how it is.  It's like we've discussed many times on the show.  And then it's forgotten.  Quickly.  Yeah, and they'd zip him up in the wrong body bag.  And you're like, wow, he was important to us as viewers, but the streets, he's just another 
[01:44:00]  scumbag with a shot.  Look how good Michael K. Williams is doing now, man.  You know?  I'm on boardwalk, and he's a great guy.  Yeah.  Do you feel like when you go out for gigs afterwards, everybody sees you as that?  Or is it because you were on the whole run?  Some guys, like Jamie Hector, was only on the last couple of seasons, but you were there  from day one.  Do you kind of worry that you're going to get, I guess, pigeonholed or typecast?  You know, you worry about that.  You know, these are the type of characters I play.  I play like the best friend, the cop, the dirty cop, the criminal. 
[01:44:30]  You know?  It's what you make of it, you know?  I think when you've got a show like that, though, where the characters are really pretty  in-depth, it's harder to become typecast, you know?  And especially with a large ensemble cast like that.  Something like, obviously, Gilligan's Island.  Now there's going to be a problem once you leave that show, because the character is not  very, you know, deep or anything like that.  You don't think Alan Hale had an easy time after that? 
[01:45:00]  Alan Hale.  I wish I was back on that island.  Even shit I see before Gilligan's Island was made, like you watch a Twilight Zone and  go, ah, it was the professor.  Well, he's going to be the professor.  What's he doing?  He was going to be the professor.  That ended all their careers, though.  Like, none of them did anything at the time.  Done.  Because, yeah, and that's something to be scared of, is a kind of one of those novelty  shows.  If you're in a big novelty show, there's going to be a fucking problem. 
[01:45:30]  Not many people have broken out of that.  How many years later, and we're still talking about Gilligan's Island?  Yeah, yeah.  But those people wanted to do something else with their lives.  Yeah.  They didn't want to sit around just talking about that for the next 50 years of their lives.  Like Mr. Brady's.  Right, right.  You can't patch a hole in a boat.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, the Brady Bunch guys.  Mr. Brady was just like, he wanted to act.  But he took the easy way out.  He got AIDS?  What?  Well, he doesn't have to deal with all the fucking Brady Bunch questions anymore. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, jeez.  Because we've hung out with some of the Brady Bunch people, and they're in hell.  Half of them don't want to talk about it.  There's like all anyone wants to talk about, yeah.  But that's all they want to talk about every time they see him.  He wanted it to be a serious show.  A show which worked with him would fight because he wanted it to be about some depth, and they  just made cartoonish nonsense.  Have the daughter take her glasses off and drive into a painting.  Great.  Good.  Okay.  Good.  Did they do that?  Cut and print it.  Of course they did.  That's good.  And Mr. Brady's like, well, I was a Shakespearean actor.  Good for you.  You cast the last check, motherfucker. 
[01:46:30]  He couldn't wait.  Get in bed with Carol and make believe you're straight.  Exactly.  That was acting.  Exactly.  Do you have any cuts they had to do every time they'd look at her breasts and go,  cut, cut, cut.  Just pretend that you like those.  You said you were a Shakespearean actor.  You know how happy he wants to be on the set of Roots and fucking crack a few heads?  Oh, I know.  Yeah, that.  And I think right after, was it him that right after the Brady Bunch, he played a tranny or 
[01:47:00]  something on...  Oh, did he?  Like, he went right for...  I think he did the Christmas special, didn't he?  Yeah.  That was Eddie's...  One of his little elf costume.  Dominic, you've been acting your whole life?  Since I'm 15, yeah.  Wow.  Jesus, 15.  What was the first gig?  It was a Bronx girl.  Oh, wow.  What'd you do with that?  I didn't know you were in that.  Really?  Yeah, one of the buddies there, right?  Yeah, I had a real...  It was the kid selling the guns, but it was a character from Nicky Zero.  That's a hell of a way to start.  Yeah, selling the guns.  Right.  Oh, fuck.  That was you.  That's so funny when he... 
[01:47:30]  Like, ah, fuck yeah.  She got something like that.  Yeah, I remember that.  Did you know, obviously, a new...  Well, who was the actor who went to jail?  What's his real name?  Lilo Brancato.  Okay.  He was probably no indication back then that he was a problem, right?  Well, could you kind of tell him?  No, no.  He was...  Lilo was a good guy, you know?  He was a good kid.  He was very talented.  You know, he was working on a really good career, you know, and fell into his situation,  which is unfortunate, but he's a very talented... 
[01:48:00]  He's in jail for a long time, too, right?  I think he's coming out pretty soon.  Is he really?  He had a lot of time served, and, you know, I don't think they...  I don't think he got a murder charge.  He was with the guy that's...  Yeah.  But...  He's done some time already, too.  Oh, God, yeah.  He's done a lot of time.  It's been a while.  Yeah, I think it's like five years, six years now.  A lot of cops that are not too happy with him, that's for sure.  I thought he got like 20 years.  Ten.  Oh, he got ten?  Oh, okay.  Ten years.  Yeah, look at you.  What are you?  That's a long time.  I mean, I'm not saying ten years is nothing, but... 
[01:48:30]  He got ten years.  He has, what, five, six years in already?  Uh, yeah, five.  Oh, sorry.  Wow.  He could be out soon.  That's fast.  I'm up on my gold stars.  He didn't come out and do a gig.  Do you still see Chaz?  I hope he...  Actually, yeah, I don't live too far from Chaz, and...  He's a great guy.  We found him on.  Yeah.  What a nice guy.  So talented, too.  And just the one-man show is amazing.  That one-man show we went and saw him.  Oh, my God.  There's a part of it where it gets silent.  When you see The Bronx Tale, when it gets silent, when Sonny gets shot, that's a fucking 
[01:49:00]  great...  Well, I'm from that neighborhood.  I grew up on Arthur Avenue, and so when they were making The Bronx Tale, they had this  open call.  So all De Niro wanted to use non-actors, just real kids, and, like, polished them a little  bit for the screen.  And blonde-haired kid, you know, played the kids selling the guns.  Wow.  He just went like, yeah, you'll work.  Yeah.  You'll work for this.  So you did scenes with De Niro and fucking Chaz, your first movie? 
[01:49:30]  I only did scenes with Chaz, but was directed by De Niro.  Oh.  His directorial movie.  That's a hell of a way to start.  Yeah, right?  That's a first gig.  Holy shit.  It's all downhill after that.  People are hoping someday to work with De Niro, not start.  Was he a good director, or, like, when he'd say something, you'd be like, what, is this  fucking guy's first time?  What's he doing?  Oh, for a minute.  Imagine you start copping an attitude your first gig.  He was actually really hands-on, you know?  I don't know what it is to work with him on a set where he's acting with him, but as a 
[01:50:00]  director, he was really hands-on, and really talked to us, really told us what he wanted.  Couldn't have been nicer to us.  Do you think he'd remember you from that?  I don't know.  I haven't.  You haven't bumped into him?  No.  I haven't been in Tribeca in a while.  It's amazing.  That's all I think of, though.  What do you remember you?  It's like, why did I ever think, like, a professional?  Like, I never think, will you do another gig with him?  It's always like, you know.  You're such a little fan.  I love it.  I make myself nauseous. 
[01:50:30]  That's all I want to know.  He's a really big movie buff.  I mean, that's what we were taught.  A lot of film talk.  Oh, yeah.  We would talk about movies from the 70s.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy knows a lot of fucking movies.  And we were just walking around at 3 o'clock in the morning.  What was that?  In Queens?  It was like we were shooting all night.  It was just kind of cool just to walk around.  It was quiet and kind of creepy.  But you knew nothing bad was going to happen because it was a set, like, right down the street.  It was really a fucking fun hang.  That sounds pretty cool.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I just kept being afraid.  What a great set that was.  Yeah.  Hanging the guy off the fucking, hanging the guy off the thing. 
[01:51:00]  How about if I describe it?  Hanging Jason, hanging the guy off the thing, asshole.  Hanging Jason Schwartzman off a fucking small overhang.  Holy shit.  You're here for, obviously, Breakout Kings.  Yeah.  Wow, they are really pushing that show.  There's a lot of ads.  You know, A&E is really keeping the end of the bargain.  You know, they really put in the show out there.  There's a bunch of advertisements in L.A. 
[01:51:30]  I mean, you turn on A&E.  Every other commercial is Breakout Kings.  Yeah.  And A&E, they give you a lot of freedom over there as far as language and content.  I'm not talking like Showtime or anything.  I think a little more than Network, but not as much as Showtime or HBO.  Yeah.  It was good, though.  I saw both episodes.  It was really good.  You're great.  Yeah, yeah.  Good.  How many did you shoot?  We shot 13. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, you shot the whole season.  We shot the pilot and then we shot 12.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  It's getting good reviews and the critics are saying that it's a little too violent.  Which means that's great.  Of course.  That's what you...  When a show is supposed to be...  But Dexter's okay.  Yeah.  Right.  When a show is...  When the content of the show is violent, then isn't violence good?  It's supposed to be there?  Yeah.  Like, I like when they tell people, you know, we don't like the idea of people smoking cigarettes 
[01:52:30]  in movies anymore because children are going to watch it.  It's like, people smoke.  And if that character would smoke, then you have them smoking.  Give us a fuck what, like, people are going to think.  Well, teach your kids not to smoke.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, look.  He's an asshole.  He's smoking.  Don't do that.  Is it hard after seeing scripts like The Wire to see other scripts?  Like, it's got to be hard because you've read such amazing stuff to see.  What's this shit?  Yeah, there has to be some that you've read that were like, eww.  I mean, you know, you always come across, you know, stuff that's just like, um... 
[01:53:00]  Can't do it.  I don't get it, you know?  But, you know, you get really spoiled.  You get spoiled.  You get really spoiled.  You know, reading David Simon stuff.  But I got to tell you, Nick Santora and Matt Homestead, they really pumped out some really cool scripts.  Really cool ideas.  The dynamic of this show, fugitives and cons.  Cons, helping to catch all the cons.  When I read the pilot, I was like, wow, you know, which was originally set up someplace else and then A&E took over and they ran with the ball. 
[01:53:30]  But you look at the concept and nobody's really doing that.  Yeah.  Yeah, the first episode, they're looking for a bad guy.  But the second one, they're right after a pedophile.  I'm like, wow, they don't fucking play games.  Right into pedophilia.  Yeah.  It was great.  He's a naughty boy.  He was a naughty, naughty boy.  Very fresh.  Yeah, there's some epic, you have that, you have the pedophile, you have like this natural-born killer kind of couple. 
[01:54:00]  It's just, we got the, we got T-Bag from Prison Break.  Who's that?  I don't know who that is.  Robert Knepper.  No.  No.  One very notorious prisoner on Prison Break.  I never saw Prison Break.  You didn't watch it, huh?  No.  No, I never saw Prison Break. 
[01:54:30]  What was it?  Prison Break.  It was a show that.  Oh, it was on for like seven years.  Was it really?  Yeah.  It was a show.  It was very difficult to.  How have you not seen Prison Break?  No, I never saw it.  It was kind of difficult for them to go past the first season on Prison Break, though, because it was like, okay, break them out.  That's it.  They're out.  Now what?  Break them out again.  Break them out again.  That's pretty much.  And again, and again.  It's like take the money and run.  They do the same thing.  Woody Allen, I was watching that.  Sometimes you can't show a 25-year-old chick Woody Allen movies.  Oh, no. 
[01:55:00]  They don't get it.  But hold on, we got to slow down a little bit, but she can't be polite about it.  What did she say?  She actually didn't say anything.  Was she nice to you about it?  Yeah.  She was just like.  Besides calling you old and everything else?  No, she hadn't showered in a couple days, and she put her head next to mine.  She's like, does my head stink?  And I'm like, all right, I'll turn this off.  Oh, shit.  What she said to me is my head stink.  I'm like, all right, I get it.  You're not enjoying the film.  I called my girl a fuss budget last night.  I said she was a fuss budget. 
[01:55:30]  Whoa.  And she tweeted it like, oh, my God.  What's a fuss?  I haven't heard that term.  She goes, no one's used that since the 1800s.  It really is.  Wow.  It really is fucking an old man thing to say.  Stop being a fuss budget.  But you weren't being ironic?  No, I kind of was, because then I said skullduggery also.  I don't know where I used that.  Yes, they don't like hearing those words, though, when they're in their early 20s.  No reason to pull the gloves off.  Fuss budgets won't.  No, that's why I use that.  Beats cunt. 
[01:56:00]  Keeps the arguments down.  I know, but they all know you mean it.  Fuss budget is just a longer cunt.  Everybody knows that.  Look at the dictionary.  On the fuss budget.  Cunt.  It's in a thesaurus.  Goddamn, man.  You got any movies lined up?  Or is this keeping you relatively busy, I guess?  Yeah, just right now, I was just busy doing Breakout Kings for the last five months.  Yeah.  What do you like doing when you're not working?  I like getting something else and continue working.  Continue working, yeah. 
[01:56:30]  I like staying busy.  I really do.  I would think, because a lot of guys do that when they have a series, especially a series  that is pretty well established.  You would think the actors would be like, all right, we're on a hiatus.  I'm not going to do anything.  But it's like, I've got to go out.  I've got to work.  I've got to keep my face out there.  It's really not about keeping my face out there.  He'll tell you, I really just love what I do.  I love to work.  But I would like to do a movie, because it's a little slower. 
[01:57:00]  Doing television is such a fast-paced shooting, an episode, seven days, you know, you're working  18 hours a day.  That always amazes me.  You get to flex your muscles a little more.  Yeah, I know what you mean.  Like, sometimes when we're on long vacations, you start getting the itch to just go like,  how many times can I play golf?  Or how many times can I do this?  Start babbling to people on vacation.  They don't want to hear it.  I'd love to get anything.  I've got to talk to somebody.  Any gig I'll take. 
[01:57:30]  Any fun.  Yes.  Are you enjoying the whole Charlie Sheen unfolding thing?  Oh, my God.  Hopefully you might go back.  What's that?  Oh, for Border Death?  Yeah.  They said that, but they always tell me.  I remember, this is how fucking goable I am.  No, they love you, man.  They do, but I remember when we shot an episode of Ed, I played one of three.  I was on the third episode of Ed, like, you don't know that.  You know, it's the one they all talk about.  It was me and two other guys.  And they said to us, you know, they like you.  No, it was two other white guys.  What did you do with Patrice?  Did you do a show with Patrice?  He doesn't want to talk about it. 
[01:58:00]  The movie.  Oh, Furry Vengeance.  Yes, we did it.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  He does Patrice.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we did Furry Vengeance.  It was a really great film.  Made all the festivals.  Oh, shit.  Be proud of your work, sir.  I am.  Let's work with Brooke Shields.  And Brendan Fraser.  That was great.  Yes.  But, yeah, the movie didn't do well.  You know, surprisingly.  Surprisingly.  I thought they were talking about it.  Ken Jeong was in it.  I mean, it's amazing.  The cast are all people who've made a shitload of money. 
[01:58:30]  And yet, once again, boy, you throw the kid in the mix and write down the fucking tubes.  I really am a fucking cancer cluster on any project.  Wow.  Oh, don't let them look at the rotten flag.  That's actually better than I thought.  You don't want to see that.  8% positive reviews?  I thought it was two.  It's gone up recently.  No, no.  Yeah, we did Furry Vengeance together.  And, oh, fuck.  Well, but they love you, man.  Boy to Death likes me, but on Ed.  I thought Ed was going to be this big thing.  And then they go, you know, man, it may even be a spinoff with you three friends. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, wow.  They said that?  Yes, and I actually believed it.  I kept, like, waiting for, like, maybe there'd be a script as a spinoff for the three friends.  Are you still waiting?  There's one.  I was okay in it, but there's one line I always hated the way I delivered.  Like, the guy was supposed to be like, yeah, we were friends.  And I go, yeah.  Was it Louis Vengeance?  No, it wasn't that fucking horrible.  And I'm like, yeah, friends.  Oh.  Yeah, it wasn't that good.  It was fun.  You need a show, man.  We had Chaz when he came into a scene with a comedian we know, Rich Voss. 
[01:59:30]  We should have played for him, man.  It's so goddamn good.  It really is bad.  We had Rich Voss act.  Well, we got to set it up better than that.  Rich knew he was going to act that day and fool around with A Bronx Tale.  With me.  But he didn't know that Chaz was going to, like, at the last second, take Jimmy's place.  So he was out of his mind.  Like, holy shit, I'm doing lines with Chaz.  What scene was it?  It was where he's asking him how to get out.  He's like, hey, that guy owes me $20.  What do I do? 
[02:00:00]  Oh, okay.  But his name was different in the original script than it was.  Right, in the movie.  What's his name in the movie?  Oh, God.  Sonny, right?  Sonny.  It was Sonny.  Yeah.  But it was different.  It was Johnny, I think, in the script.  John.  John.  John.  And, oh, it was so fucking bad.  When they were looking for Louie Beans, was that in the, uh...  Yeah.  It's the Louie Beans scene.  Oh, was he fucking...  It's so bad.  But, dude, it couldn't have been better because Chaz was standing there and I'm standing there.  I mean, me and Voss are standing there. 
[02:00:30]  And then Chaz just walks into the studio and Rich is already at the fucking microphone.  And he just starts shaking.  He was like, oh, no.  Yeah.  Dude, he was nervous reading with me when he thought he had to do with me.  And I'm fucking horrendous.  And he was really trying to act.  He was really trying to act.  Oh, John.  That's really humiliating.  You reed.  Oh.  Do we have video of that?  No.  We have the short production piece.  We can play that as we look for the video.  We had video of it.  It's just...  Oh, God.  I forgot.  It's such a perfect walk-in. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  It freaked him out.  And Chaz, I kind of fucking ambushed Chaz in the fucking dressing room.  Because you can't ask in advance.  So, like, as he was about to come on, I'm like, yeah, we want to do this whole thing  where you just read the scene.  It's cool, right?  And he was like, uh, all right.  He didn't want to, but he had to.  Yeah, I got to.  He kind of had to at that moment.  And it was so natural.  What, did they just put Rob Moss' face on the characters in the movie?  That's pretty funny.  Did we film that?  Yes, we did.  I wanted to play the production piece.  Yeah, let's hear that. 
[02:01:30]  Robert De Niro.  It's not what you say.  It's what he sees.  In his directorial debut.  We can't accept that.  Starring Chaz Palminteri.  I didn't give it to you.  I gave it to your son.  And Rich Voss.  Louie, Beans, I want my money.  A block.  Tell.  Beans, you can't dodge me forever.  Come on, what are you doing about?  What are you yelling about, huh?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie Beans.  This guy owes me 20, and it's been two weeks now, and every time he sees me, he keeps dying  to me, John.  Should I crack him one or what? 
[02:02:00]  The struggle of an idiotic Jewish comedian stammering his way through a few lines of film dialogue  with a genuine Hollywood actor.  Listen, see, sometimes violence is not the answer.  Is he a good friend of yours or not?  Nah, John, I don't even like him.  Well, there's your answer right there.  Look at it this way.  It costs you $20 to get rid of him.  He's never going to ask you for money again.  He's never going to bother you again.  He's out of your life for $20.  Come on, you got to have cheap.  You're right, John.  You're always right.  A brunch tale. 
[02:02:30]  How do you know the right answer all the time, Johnny?  Well, I try to keep my eyes and ears open all the time, and I read.  Okay.  You read?  Yeah, I read.  Come on.  Come on, let's go to Mario's next door and get something.  And that was a genuine reaction from Voss.  Huh?  When he said, you read, that was the only genuine reaction.  Yeah, that was not acting.  You can't believe that somebody would engage in such a mindless activity.  We set him off so bad that day.  But what do you think of it?  And Chaz is just amazing.  Like, you hear Chaz Palminteri.  You would think, like, we took clips from the movie and threw Voss in there. 
[02:03:00]  Like, he is so good.  He's got that down, the cadence and the fucking...  It's been a part of his life for a really long time.  You know, even before it was a movie, it was a one-man show.  Yeah.  You know, that's how he got it sold, and then he shot the...  And then recently, what, a year ago, two years ago, he was back on the road.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's why he was in.  That's why he was in.  He was promoting that.  Yeah.  But to hear the dialogue so naturally delivered.  I know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what it is.  That was so naturally like a conversation, and Rich is just in there like... 
[02:03:30]  But the...  Beans!  Louis Beans!  Over the top, Voss!  But with not an ounce of real emotion behind it.  No, if someone was talking to you like that in the street, you'd be like,  Are you having a stroke?  Is something wrong with you?  It wasn't a regular, genuine conversation.  You know what I noticed about you, too?  My mistake is I don't study the lines hard enough when I do something.  Like, you were really obsessed with being off, with having the dialogue down,  which you kind of have to when you do a scene. 
[02:04:00]  And I guess that takes the pressure off.  You don't...  I do, but I'm so distracted all the time.  It's hard for me...  Oh, really?  When rehearsing?  Yeah, just getting lines down.  Like, I'm never off book before I get there.  Even before an audition, I just keep putting it off, and I don't know why I do that.  Do you fuck up a lot?  Yes.  In the middle of it?  No, I didn't during...  No, he did.  He actually...  No.  No, I didn't have a lot of flubs while we were doing it.  Especially when I was working with a guy who I like a lot.  I'm like, I can't humiliate myself.  And I had scenes with Ted.  I'm like, you just...  You can't. 
[02:04:30]  Remember that?  Wait, wait.  I remember the day we were shooting, and we had them all sitting in the chair, and we  were doing three, four takes.  But it wasn't our fourth.  It was just...  It was just so funny.  Oh, everybody was kind of...  Oh, yeah.  Breaking people up.  When we had them kidnapped?  Yeah, you were on the floor.  Your pants have...  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, yeah.  I actually have three different takes that one of the production guys sent me, the footage  of my ass hanging out.  And I had to point a gun at Ted at one point, and there's one... 
[02:05:00]  I felt so fraudulent.  Like, I had to just turn and point the gun.  And I'm just like...  Every time I would do it, I was just like, you're pointing a gun, you're not a good actor.  It was so hard to fucking hold a gun.  Holding a gun...  Who said it?  Michael Madsen?  He was in...  Yeah, he said it.  And he said fucking holding a gun, watching a guy hold a gun, is important to him, because  he knows how to hold a gun.  You got to look natural doing it.  I didn't.  I didn't.  It was just like my arm was all stiff.  It was a really bad impression of people who have tried to hold guns.  Even simple things like smoking a cigarette. 
[02:05:30]  You got to make it look natural.  Oh, yeah.  It's just the camera picks up things differently.  Oh, yeah.  I look all stiff.  You tend to overdo things when you're trying to...  You know, when you're trying to make them look real, you tend to overdo them.  And it's so odd, because just in life, you can just do shit.  You don't even think twice about it.  You'd be the greatest actor in the world, because you're a natural.  And the second you have to do something for a camera...  You got to bring that mindset when you're working on a set. 
[02:06:00]  Is that what you...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we all had some acting experience, though.  I mean, the three of us did a commercial one time together.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yes, we did.  That was great.  And you may have that.  I would say none of us were stellar.  For XM.  And we were just playing ourselves, so it's like, how bad could you fuck up?  But we did.  Do you want the outtakes?  Is there one regular one with the commercial?  Because the outtakes were all silly.  But the actual commercial...  Well, we've been in so many commercials. 
[02:06:30]  Look at the other one there.  The other one you guys were good at, though.  That was the CBS commercial, you guys?  Oh, God.  That was actually good.  Yeah, we did all right with that.  That was actually well done.  The XM one was like, ugh.  30 seconds took fucking 12 hours to do.  That's great.  That was actually well done.  But that had nothing to do with us?  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  It was a movie set.  Yeah, it pretty much was.  I'm serious.  It's like, oh, a color gel just came off a light.  Let's take a half hour to find the guy that's allowed to climb the ladder.  No joke.  They set it up like it was a movie scene they were doing that day. 
[02:07:00]  The XM one wasn't set up like that.  It was like one guy with a dolly in a warehouse.  Yeah, I know.  I felt like I was going to be whacked walking into the place.  Oh, it was awful.  Yeah.  What the fuck is this?  A bunch of chairs stacked up in the corner.  You didn't see plastic on the floor, so you knew you were right.  We were there 12 hours, and we were on set with action, maybe 10 total minutes.  Yeah.  But that's how it is.  Yep.  It was unbelievable.  I'm like, how is this fun?  I love when they would say, all right, take a few, and you can just go sit in the trailer 
[02:07:30]  and do nothing.  I love that.  I don't have to.  I can't fail there.  I love technical difficulties.  It's all about Jimmy.  I can't fail there.  I would knock on your door.  I'm like, come on, let's go get a cup of coffee or something.  Downtime three hours.  Do you know how many times you would knock on the door?  I'll tell you this now.  I'd be on my Verizon wireless car.  I would literally just sit in the chair.  You lost it one day.  Did I?  Yeah.  I don't even remember.  You'd be trying to find the Verizon store.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Because I would jerk off in the trailer.  Oh, Jesus.  I swear to God, that's what I was doing. 
[02:08:00]  And he just wanted a cup of coffee.  No, but I would go out with him.  It was raindrops.  I would be like, you can't not go for coffee with Dom because you're jerking off.  But it's so hard to not do that.  But I would literally just be in the trailer.  He'd be rehearsing.  And I would actually hear him sometimes running through lines.  And our trailers were adjacent.  And I was just literally with my fucking, my shirt rolled up to under my tits so the  pre-cum didn't stain my shirt.  Honestly.  You can't stain your wardrobe.  You're a madman.  I'm honest with you.  You're on a TV set.  I was on a TV set. 
[02:08:30]  He's got a crazy schedule.  Yeah.  Well, you gotta give it to him.  You gotta get it in somewhere.  He's able to juggle all those things.  Just fucking sitting in the trailer with my dick against my fat stomach, zoned out, looking  at X-Tube and X-Hamster like a fucking piece of shit.  He's knocking.  He wants to get coffee.  Yeah, I'll be happy right now.  I'm just getting dressed.  Give me a few.  You have that commercial?  Jesus Christ.  Could you turn that a little bit?  Oh, boy.  That was really...  We've all had our acting experience.  There we go.  Oh, it's good. 
[02:09:00]  She had a lovely pair, Anthony.  Pair.  Pants.  Shoes.  From here to here, Anthony.  A lovely pair.  Yeah, I know.  But this doesn't play on the radio.  So bad.  Hey, idiots.  And the applause of the sitcom.  You can say whatever you want now.  You're on XM, remember?  She had a monster set up.  The Opie and Anthony show.  That was actually a good cut at the end.  That wasn't bad.  That's all right. 
[02:09:30]  But do you know how awful it was?  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  That...  What are you going to do?  They put in a...  My line was so bad that they couldn't even put in canned laughter after it.  That was good.  They gave me a canned bomb.  Fucking assholes.  Hey, Wicklin, you couldn't have put a better laugh at the end there?  It was a horrible fucking laugh.  Shit.  And that commercial was what?  30 seconds?  We were there for maybe five minutes.  Yeah.  I remember that was really quick.  We were actually there for less time than the commercial ran.  Yeah, I don't know how that works.  There was a difference between the two commercials we shot that year. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, that was...  And weird.  We haven't done one since, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  I wonder why.  Did that ever run anywhere?  No.  How long ago was that?  That was fucking...  About four years ago.  How long?  No, we came back.  I'd say 2006.  It's five years ago.  Are you kidding me?  That long?  That long?  What the fuck is time going?  Jesus Christ.  Dude, we've been on here almost seven years.  Do you know we've been back almost seven...  We've been on since October of 2004.  Wow.  Six and a half years is about.  Fucking six and a half years we've been back on. 
[02:10:30]  December 2006.  It's time to fuck this up again.  How fucking...  I've been saying that for weeks.  You've been saying that for six years and three months?  I've been itching.  I'm itching.  I'm itching.  I'm itching to do it again.  Well, Dominic, man.  Fucking pleasure.  Thank you, buddy.  Breakout kings.  Let me give you the plug when it's on, because we're here talking about...  We're not giving you a plug when it's on.  It premieres this Sunday at 10 o'clock on A&E, and Dom is the star of it.  We're one of a couple of stars, but you're the biggest name in it, I think.  And he plays a U.S. Marshal.  I don't know if we've said that. 
[02:11:00]  Yes.  Okay.  The show revolves around your character and the other guy.  Yeah, and it's cool.  But he's not here, so he's just the other guy.  There's a cool reveal at the end of the...  Yeah.  There's a cool reveal at the end of the pilot, which...  It makes the show make more...  I won't say what it is, obviously.  Yeah.  But it makes the show...  The concept of the show make a lot more sense when the reveal is like, oh, okay.  But you do a great job, and it's a good show, man.  I'm happy for you, and it's getting good reviews.  Except it's too violent.  So don't watch it if you don't like violence.  Oh, jeez.  Lock the kids in their room. 
[02:11:30]  You wanted to be part of the show, didn't you, Jimmy?  I'm going to get Jimmy on that show.  I'd love to.  You already did a pedophile episode?  Figure out what kind of criminal he could be.  Oh, that's easy.  Yeah.  The cum bandit.  The cum bandit.  What do you...  What do you...  Steal it?  I don't...  No, I don't steal it.  He's a janitor in a Catholic girl's school.  Yeah.  His little hair's on the chair on the seats.  We'll consult with you.  Trust me.  We'll find a nice criminal for Jimmy.  Yeah.  To play.  Hold on.  I'm going to get him on.  If you're pointing a gun at me, I'll...  Come on, man! 
[02:12:00]  Oh, my God.  Damn.  All right.  You got that on tape, Sam?  Please.  Go to the producers.  Immediately.  How annoying would you be if I did an episode of Breakout Kings and you guys were canceled  the next week?  I just have that knack.  For your own sake, don't put me on.  I'm fucking...  I'm death, brother.  You're coming on.  That's cool.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Dom, I love you.  You know that.  I'm fucking happy that you came in.  Yeah.  Now we like you, too.  Very cool.  Yeah.  You got to come back and say hi, man.  Absolutely.  This Sunday, 10 o'clock, A&E, Breakout Kings. 
[02:12:30]  Great show with my buddy, Dom Lombardozzi.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks for having me.  No problem.  Follow the O.B. and Anthony Show on Facebook.  Facebook.com slash O.B. and Anthony.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  A few people amazed that you were jerking off in a trailer on a TV set.  Are they really? 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  I think people think you should just be focused.  My trailer door was locked, but some people might not understand that you really do have  a lot of time hours, like when they go, all right, turn it around, when they have to just  do a reverse angle of the shot and the cameras, that can take an hour sometimes, or an hour  and 20 minutes.  And you might have one line in the scene.  Yeah.  They got...  I love when they do that.  Yeah.  We're going to turn this around.  We got to turn this around.  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  And then it's like, oh, so just fucking like a tripod.  You spin the head of the tripod around there.  It's turning around.  What?  Now what?  It takes forever.  There's a movie set up in the hood right now, the neighborhood.  And I've been watching them set up outside a bank all day.  Yeah.  Yesterday.  All day.  I saw them on the way home, and then I went to the gym later on in the afternoon.  They were still setting up, setting up the lights, setting up a fake flower stand.  And you know it's only going to be in the film for five seconds. 
[02:14:00]  That's why movies cost like $100 million to make.  It's like, if you honestly took what it took to make the movie, it probably would be a quarter of that.  But you would think it's just a waste of time.  You just get one big light, light up the area, and get a camera guy.  That's all it takes.  But there were so much.  There were trailers and huge cables that ran to...  I don't even know where they were plugging in.  Yeah, where are they going?  And you know it's only going to be in the movie for, what, maybe a minute if it's a big scene?  Some of those things, if it's in the movie at all. 
[02:14:30]  Right.  Sometimes they just hack it right out.  All that work went into a quick shot.  And the guy's working their asses off, and then the actors and the director just come on set and go,  Okay, looks all good.  That's what I do.  And one problem could take so long to fix.  Oh, my God.  It could be, like you said before, one of those lighting issues.  Yeah.  Lighting issues.  It's just like, oh, boy, this isn't going to be quick.  When they go like, all right, we have to fix something, you know you're not going to just stand there and wait for them to fix it, because it's going to take hours. 
[02:15:00]  The only thing that you can do quickly is if they say, we've got to change the battery in the camera.  Like that type of stuff they could do within a minute or two minutes.  But the other stuff, it's just these crews.  But that's why movies look the way they look without shadows all over the place and without the light bouncing off everything, because they really are amazing.  And matching up light from different places.  When Kevin Smith invited me to the set, and it was the car chase scene with Tracy and Bruce Willis. 
[02:15:30]  But we were there for probably six hours and watched maybe 40 seconds of actual shooting, but still had a ball.  I've never been on a movie set before.  It was awesome.  Just how they wet down the road.  Yeah, you've got to have that wet.  All these little tricks they do.  I'm guessing that's for light bouncing.  Is that why they do that?  It looks just great on film.  It always looks better when the road's a little wet.  It gets that glistening thing to it.  So that took a while.  All right, let's get the truck and water everything down. 
[02:16:00]  And then you've got to make sure the water kind of seeps in so it doesn't look like it's soaked.  Yeah.  It was really, really interesting to check it out.  Let me have thought that up first.  And then Kevin arrives on set.  Everything looks great.  Let's do this.  You know?  Did it a couple times.  That was it.  And he goes, well, you can stick around.  But, I mean, we're not shooting for at least another four hours now.  So now we have to go to the next block and set up something.  Four hours.  Oh, yeah.  To just.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Really, really.  It really is an endless process, man.  A long, long. 
[02:16:30]  And they're making movies a lot faster than they used to.  Yeah.  Because the big stars don't have time anymore.  They've got so many projects lined up.  Oh, is that why?  Okay.  Yeah.  So they can only get them for now a month.  It used to be, what?  Some of these movies was a year.  It was going to take fucking a year to film.  Like, Apocalypse was one of those classic ones that took forever.  Right.  To film.  That was a long process.  Charlie Sheen has 736,000 followers.  Does that just make you sad?  He's the one. 
[02:17:00]  Right now, he's the biggest story in the country, so it doesn't bug me.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, I don't mind it as much.  Yeah.  Is he the quickest to a million, you think?  A million followers?  He's going to have a million.  How long did Bieber take or Lady Gaga?  I don't know.  Remember the big story of CNN with Kusher?  Who will have a million first?  That was the big race between those two.  But it took a while.  Sheen's going to do it in a day.  He jumped on Twitter late yesterday, right?  Late afternoon, maybe early evening.  So he's going to have a million before he's been on Twitter for an entire day. 
[02:17:30]  Amazing.  Jesus.  But there's a burnout factor there, too.  Yeah.  Although today, the story continues because they took his kids away.  He was just on the Today Show talking about it.  Yeah, but we don't like the tragic part of it.  We like the comedic part of the full story.  And why the fuck do they have to fuck it up for all of us?  Yeah.  If you follow this on Twitter, people are all team fucking Charlie.  Yeah.  Big time.  Everyone's loving him.  And now the fucking people have to grab his kids, and it's just a bummer for everybody now. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  You couldn't wait a couple more days?  Because that's going to calm him down a little bit.  You think?  Yes.  He doesn't want to lose his kids in the end.  That's publicly sad, but it's also humiliating.  Of course.  That's going to calm him down quickly.  You watch.  He followed P. Diddy.  Like, one of the first people he was following is P. Diddy.  And P. Diddy just used the occasion to plug some gig.  Fucking asshole.  He's like, oh, yeah, and the Charlie and the goddesses are going to be at... 
[02:18:30]  And then he plugged one of his gigs.  Really?  It's like, Jesus.  That's clever.  You suck.  He's a horrible one to follow.  Although, you know, great opportunity to plug a gig, I guess.  I know.  If you're fucking...  I was trying passwords.  I was putting his name in and trying different passwords.  Like, winning.  Winning one.  Like that.  F-18.  Yeah, just to try to get in.  Because if you had managed to get in and just added yourself to his friends list when 
[02:19:00]  there was like 15 people on there, it would be huge.  So I was trying all kinds of passwords, but no.  Did you try Vaughn99?  No.  I'm going to try it.  Try that.  Try that one.  I'm going to try that one.  Yeah.  I was trying all kinds.  I'm going to try that one.  I'll be right back.  I'm sorry.  Apocalypse.  I have to do a phone.  I tried quite a few.  Danny will break it.  I have to plug my gig. 
[02:19:30]  And us as friends.  You hear this, Andy?  Jimmy's leaving.  What?  I'm coming back.  I have to do a phone.  A phone?  A boner?  Touching Rich.  But you're doing a radio show right now.  I know.  Yeah, this is a radio show.  You don't need to do another radio show.  You're doing a radio show.  What would you do if it just went doo-doo-doo-doo and you were on?  I would tweet BeatSpin to everyone.  BeatSpin!  Another link.  It's like, yeah.  Winning.  Winning.  And then just put the link to BeatSpin on there?  Yeah.  Fuck it.  I just don't care anymore with the link. 
[02:20:00]  All right.  Jimmy left.  That would rule.  Yeah.  Jimmy had to go make a phone call.  And is E-Rock okay?  E-Rock?  I noticed the first hour back, we couldn't see your face, and now we see your face.  And I noticed you talked into my ear a little bit.  So that's good.  Oh.  So things get back to normal?  Through the headphones or a little cuddly whisper?  No, he actually right in my ear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Happy birthday, E-Rock.  Happy birthday, E-Rock.  Do you accept my apology?  I was, my temper ran away with me a little bit this morning. 
[02:20:30]  You ready to talk?  Because Jimmy's not here.  Wow, he's not ready to talk.  He's not ready to talk.  It's his birthday.  But we just put our asses on the line for you.  I don't.  Oh, shit.  I don't know.  We really put ourselves on the line to save your job.  Yeah, we do that all the time, I guess.  Even though it's our fault that you might get fired.  No, you won't get fired.  It's not even close.  Come on, E-Rock.  Smile. 
[02:21:00]  Smile, though your heart is...  Yeah, let's play that.  I know.  What do you think of the kids?  Look at Shithead comes in.  Sam, he smelt it.  He's like, wait a minute.  How's E-Rock doing?  What's the vibe?  Yeah, vibe.  Guys, we've had about an hour or so where we had to do other things for the show.  And you had a great interview and everything.  Dominic's all right, man.  Another one that's going to become a friend.  Yeah, and he's going to be a big...  I mean, he already is a big star.  E-Rock is a big fan of the lawyer. 
[02:21:30]  Hold on, hold on.  We're live open forum.  Do you want Shithead to call you?  Well, yeah, just something, anything.  Even if he just calls and hears my voice and hangs up really quick.  Why don't you call him?  I deleted his number from my phone.  Why?  Out of anger?  Nah, just it was a recommendation from this guy.  I don't know.  Probably smart advice from the lawyer.  And Charlie is planning on suing CBS.  Okay, Ant.  Jesus.  We nailed it.  We nailed it as a show.  He wants Chuck to call him.  That's the creator of Two and a Half Men.  Yes.  He wants to work this out. 
[02:22:00]  He does.  That's why he's not being completely crazy.  And that's why he never totally went nuts with this thing.  Yeah, he never went all in.  Right.  Because, I mean, the guys in entertainment in general, they do have thick skins.  They could accept some of this stuff.  Yeah.  And like we said, he didn't go too far with anything yet.  Mm-hmm.  He's nothing unforgivable yet.  And his eyes look way clearer.  Do they?  Yes, man.  He's definitely trying to stay off everything.  Hmm.  What was that live on?  Today.  Today's show?  It happened. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, it happened.  Back to Mr. Roker.  Wow.  A little walk this way.  I'm just seeing if Jimmy was awake.  He is.  He's Jim Corrigan, ladies and gentlemen.  That was a hell of a draw, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Big, huge network show.  There's got to be ten people checking them out.  What's going on?  And we've got another big storm making its way onto the West Coast.  Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, down to...  Watch that R-word.  Yeah, did you take the R-word pledge, Sam?  Yeah, I did.  Congratulations.  Yes, I did.  You probably did.  Why do you look at me with disgust?  Because we shouldn't fuck around with language. 
[02:23:00]  Well, I took...  It's a personal pledge.  It's not for everybody.  Oh.  Do you know any people that are mentally handicapped?  No.  I think you do.  Well, I mean...  Oh, no.  I'm not going to...  No, I didn't mean anyone in particular.  No, I'm trying to patch things up with E-Rod.  You meant Bobo, and you went and looked at Eric.  Well, Bobo's not...  I mean, is he in the game?  You hurt with a look.  Forget about words.  You hurt with your look.  I was looking at my reflection in the mirror.  I'm very...  In the window.  I'm vain, as you know.  You're breathing hurts people. 
[02:23:30]  Why do you say that?  I know.  You just hurt people.  Okay, I'm starting to think of some of the venom that you guys normally direct toward  a certain birthday boy.  We're frustrated that we can't go after him today.  He's pretty much off limits for the rest of the show.  I know.  He's done.  We understand we took it as far as we possibly can, so we have to do this to somebody.  I asked him how he was doing just during the last break.  Yeah, good.  And?  He's livid.  He's livid.  Are you livid?  Iraq, thumbs up for livid.  Would you be livid?  Let me see.  Thumbs up for livid?  Thumbs up for livid.  Thumbs up.  He is livid. 
[02:24:00]  He is officially self-proclaimed livid.  Can we at least hear your voice on the show today?  Oh, he shook his head no.  It's your birthday, man.  He's the birthday boy.  I feel bad that this happened on his birthday.  When is Iraq allowed to say no?  Because this was supposed to happen on his birthday.  Was it?  Of course.  It was a bit.  The fucked up thing is it was ruined before the show.  Charlie now lives with his two new girlfriends, his goddesses.  Earlier this morning, I sat down with Charlie and his attorney for an exclusive live interview here on Today. 
[02:24:30]  I began by asking what happened when police took the boys from his home.  That is the latest.  Good.  They were just being put to bed, and my assistant Rick informed me that the police were on their way down  to issue a restraining order.  And I thought, okay, we can deal with that.  I got you on the phone.  Got my lawyer on the phone.  And then it was revealed once I opened the door that they were there to remove Bob and Max.  So, you know, I've professed in this last few weeks to, last few days, rather, to not deal in, you know, 
[02:25:00]  come from a place of panic, ego, emotion, any of that.  So I stayed very calm and focused, and, you know, if somebody badges you, they win in that moment.  Who went and got the children, and how did they take them out of the house?  I did, and Emma and Laura, the nannies.  And we just very calmly, and, you know, we videotaped the whole thing just so there was no, nobody could claim otherwise.  You've seen the video.  It was all very even and direct.  And they didn't have car seats, so I provided them.  And I said, I love you. 
[02:25:30]  And I said, don't say goodbye.  You know, don't say goodbye.  I say, see you later.  And later is, as we believe, to be very soon.  Sitting here right now, hours after this happened, do you know where your children are at this moment?  I do not.  It's a really good question.  It's a really good point.  Yeah, and isn't there some legal protection or some law that should inform the father of where his children are being removed and delivered to?  You or any other father has the right to know where your children are. 
[02:26:00]  The silence by Brooke's attorneys is very conspicuous.  Did you say to them, did you say to those police officers, A, where are you from, and B, where are you taking my children before I just hand them over to you?  I, stupidly, this is on me, I assume they were going back to the house that they've been living in with Brooke when they're not with me.  And I think we got reports last night they were at a hotel in Santa Monica somewhere, I mean, at this moment.  With hookers and cocaine?  I do not know where my children are, but I'm not panicking. 
[02:26:30]  This is not about emotions, not about ego.  It's just about getting very focused and getting very much in touch with what I have to do to complete the task of bringing these two beautiful young men back to the home that they deserve to be raised in.  And there's nothing, there's more love, compassion, support, child care, and everything else you could possibly want for a child in this lovely home.  It's not a house, it's a home right down that hill. 
[02:27:00]  According to TMZ, and they posted this overnight, Brooke went to court yesterday and told the judge that you had threatened her recently, and that's why she filed this court order.  And she says you told her, I will cut your head off, put it in a box, and send it to your mom.  It's colorful.  Did you say that?  No, I did not, but that's a good one, I guess.  I mean, I guess if you spend enough time around me, you can formulate things and make them sound like it could have come from my mouth, but you could do that watching reruns.  A lot of people watched that video that we heard of the Today Show yesterday morning when we were in the house with your two girlfriends, the goddesses. 
[02:27:30]  Yes.  And said to themselves, you know what, maybe two young boys shouldn't be raised in this kind of environment, you know, with women who they're just meeting.  How do you respond to that?  How do you respond to the critics, and clearly your estranged wife, who agrees, who doesn't think they should be raised there?  I invite anybody at this point to come in and just observe.  If it's a court-appointed monitor, if it's somebody from her legal team, if it's her, if it's you with a camera.  There's nothing to hide, and as I said, there's nothing but love and compassion and absolute support for these amazing children.  And I'm going to go ahead and say that, you know, that regardless of what people offer in form of judgment or opinion, based on frequency, whatever, it's a hundred thousand times better than what's going to be delivered or offered in her house. 
[02:28:00]  Will you sit here today and say you're willing to go to the negotiating table with Brooke Mueller?  I mean, I'm sure your level of anger is through the roof right now, but are you willing to sit down and do this for the children and work this out?  Absolutely. And had I received a phone call, had you received a phone call, we would have been willing to play ball and say, absolutely, this is fine. 
[02:28:30]  And in fact, I was going to call her because she'd been requesting a two-hour visit, asking Lourdes the weekend to bring them somewhere.  And I had rejected it because I knew that, unlike myself, that a drug test would not be clean.  Is there anything you want to say to Brooke who may be watching right now? Maybe your only chance to talk to her.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Brooke, I'm sorry that you felt this had to be done in this way, but this does not display any responsible parenting in anything that I'm familiar with.  And I think that the cooler and smarter, leveler heads can prevail. 
[02:29:00]  And I urge you to reach out to me and immediately, if not sooner, and tell me where our sons are.  And we'll leave it there with the children. I want to move on to your legal battle at CBS.  Oh, that.  My God. That's the latest. That's the latest for his kids.  You're not going to get good quotes out of Charlie in the next day or two.  No, no, no, he's not.  Until he figures out the kid thing.  No F-18 quotes there. 
[02:29:30]  No tiger blood.  No tiger blood.  I didn't hear winning.  No.  I heard he said, you know, when you get badged, they win.  Yeah.  So, no crazy, crazy Charlie.  At a private investor conference, we had the sound from that.  There was audio rolling, so let's take a listen.  And I'm not sure if we're good.  This is what we find out about Two and a Half Men.  Doing eight less originals saves us quite a bit of money.  I'm not saying long term I want this to go on or it's great, but the repeat last night 
[02:30:00]  actually was the fourth highest rated show of the night.  He's on the air quite a bit these days.  I wish he would have worked this hard to promote himself for an Emmy.  You know, I hope it's back.  We'll see.  That was Les Moonves.  Who said that right?  So, Les Moonves is basically saying CBS is just fine without Charlie Sheen right now,  in the short term at least.  Well, I don't know if I would paraphrase it like that.  Yeah, really?  How did he take that?  I mean, it was a very intelligent spin.  I mean, he's a brilliant businessman. 
[02:30:30]  Look where he is.  Look who he got.  And, you know, you have to be nominated first to go out and launch a campaign.  So, just a little detail.  I thought the joke was funny, though.  It was a good joke.  It was a good experience.  Charlie, Meredith Fierro back in New York actually has a quick question for you.  Yeah, go for it.  Go for it, Meredith.  Yeah, hey, Jeff, Charlie.  Thank you very much.  Is this the million dollar question?  Ah.  Maybe if you give me that final answer I'm looking for.  Charlie, I want to go back to your kids, obviously. 
[02:31:00]  You're very upset about your boys.  Any message you want to give to them?  That's the question?  Bob, Max, it's Dada.  I will see you very soon.  You're right here.  They're watching the Today Show?  Yeah.  Sheen's lawyer says they're planning to fight to get the kids back  and will appear in court as early as tomorrow.  That's about it.  Damn, huh?  There's your latest on Charlie Sheen.  That's some fucked up shit.  He's keeping his shit together.  Yeah, he's not being as crazy.  Wants his kids back and he wants his show back. 
[02:31:30]  Not being as crazy.  In a way where he saves face, too.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah.  That's how it's going to end.  We know this stuff.  We just know this stuff.  They don't.  You know something?  For Les Moonves to say that and shit, they don't want to fire him.  They don't want to stop the show.  No.  Because Les could have really went at it, too.  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't want the show to stop.  They're all just kind of.  Yeah, everyone's in a holding.  They're in a holding pattern.  Until the weather clears over the runway.  The attention he's been getting.  So he's replaced his drug addiction, or at least he says he's replaced his drug addiction, 
[02:32:00]  with this new addiction to fame.  And the attention.  Well, you know, this new addiction.  No, it's an interesting point.  What are you talking about?  And I think this was very sobering for him last night.  The kids have been in the house for quite a while.  Every time we had been there since Sunday, we saw the children.  They spent a lot of time with the nannies.  He has a weekday nanny and a weekend nanny.  And I think these children literally being ripped from him last night changed perspective for him.  He told me, you know, I was really driven on the CBS front before, but now this is a new challenge before me. 
[02:32:30]  And now he wants to pull his full weight behind that.  And I think he understands that to show that he is a good dad, to show that this house is not what everyone thinks it is,  he needs to back off a little bit on that kind of language.  And I think he did a good job of that today.  I mean, you know, when you speak with him off camera, that's more of the Charlie Sheen,  the one we saw today that I normally see in the many hours I've spent with him over the past couple of days.  Perhaps he's got to stop going on Howard Stern and talking about how he has two beds that he exchange beds every night. 
[02:33:00]  So things like that, which people will say, well, it was deserved.  Because that bothers you.  Why don't you shut the fuck up, okay?  He thinks that the house that he's raising the children in is great.  He says that his two goddesses, one of them is a former porn star, one of them is a model after all.  But he says that these women love the children, they take care of the children with his professional nannies,  and he sees nothing wrong with that.  All right, well, a lot of people find that still very hard to take.  Jeff Ross, thanks so much.  No, you do!  You do! 
[02:33:30]  And that's my observation.  Holy, it's driving me nuts.  I mean, Charlie's going to be around for a while on TV.  And this is something you can enjoy yourself.  Every woman that's attached to this story, meaning reporting it, is outraged, pissed off.  Did you see her face?  She was disgusted.  She was disgusted.  All you have to do is go on a social network, whichever one you like.  I'm a big fan of the Twitter.  And you see people.  They are digging this shit, and they're not taking it too seriously. 
[02:34:00]  But the female anchors and reporters, they are so fucking pissed off.  What about the children?  And, oh my God, he has two bedrooms.  Right.  And maybe he shouldn't go on Howard Stern.  Porn star.  Here's the deal.  You do Howard's show.  Of course you're going to have a little fun with the fucking thing.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Of course.  And people understand that.  People understand there's your morning bore fest, so you have to act a certain way. 
[02:34:30]  And then if you go on a show like Howard's, you're going to fucking loosen up a little bit.  Yeah.  It's just how it is.  It depends.  It's the context of the show you're on.  Right.  Him going on Howard isn't going to change anything in the end.  No.  Because the people in charge understand the difference.  Fuck.  Did you see her face?  She was fucking repulsed.  Yeah, but, you know, was holding back, of course.  And meanwhile, off air, a lot of these reporters are the ones, you know, ah, why don't we head  down to the gin mill after this shoot and... 
[02:35:00]  And fuck each other.  Fucking do a few shooters.  Yeah.  Go home and do, after you do a few shooters.  Yeah.  But have fun with that on your own, man.  Well, watch, just look at the females in this story.  They are just so pissed off.  Repulsed.  And outraged.  Outraged.  God damn it.  It's a great story.  I'm just bummed they took his kids, because now it's going to kind of be tamed for a while.  Yeah, he's going to have to.  And that mouthpiece next to him, just probably telling him, none of your fucking Charlie-isms. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, we can't do any Gnarly-isms.  Gnarly-ism, Charlie-isms.  We're back on the Gnarly-isms, Charlie.  Gnarly-ism.  Maybe we'll have time for Gnarly-isms later on this week.  But right now, no Gnarly-isms.  You didn't hear one winning, scoreboard don't lie.  No, scoreboard don't lie.  You heard nothing of that.  I'm on a drug.  I'm on Charlie.  It's called Charlie Sheen.  None of that.  None of that.  He knows.  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's over, unfortunately.  The fun we've done over the last few days with this, I think it's over.  Probably cancel.  He'll almost have a million fucking followers, and he'll have to cancel his Twitter account, 
[02:36:00]  because it's a record of everything he says and does.  It's going so great.  It's too bad he has kids.  Because, you know.  I know.  Being a new father, I mean, I'm up to about 10 months.  That's tough.  That's tough, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't be the same fucking asshole.  You just can't, unfortunately.  It's tough.  Well, he was giving it a good shot right up until they took the kids away.  And then that stopped him in his tracks.  Yeah.  The real cost of living. 
[02:36:30]  David Bach, the founder of...  God, why...  Just fucking tell us when the warm front's moving in, Al.  How did he become...  How the fuck are you doing interviewing people?  I know.  How did he become anything more than just the weatherman that he is?  He's not even a meteorologist to me.  And I don't know if he is or not, but he's the weatherman.  The fat, jolly weatherman.  Got skinny, and now he thinks he's fucking doing interviews.  And I didn't even give a fuck about him until the whole Imus thing.  That Imus thing really hit close to home.  Oh, yeah.  That was a piss off.  And he was all about getting Imus fired. 
[02:37:00]  And then he had his own fuck up with the epilepsy thing.  And should have understood, obviously, how you can fuck up when you're doing live radio  or live TV, even though the Imus thing wasn't a fuck up.  And guess what?  Al, yours wasn't a fuck up.  Yeah.  But you can't play it both ways.  Yeah.  You know, when you're trying to entertain people, you're going to say some shit that's  going to piss off some people that could mean your job.  Yep.  You know?  He's a fucking hypocrite.  I'm just looking at some of these Charlie Sheen shirts. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, they're great, are they?  Charlie Sheen saying shirts.  But by the time you get them delivered, it's too late.  It's too late.  That's right.  They're all going to be like passe.  They're all begging for a retweet from me.  Yeah.  Just because of what you said.  Yeah.  This thing is, man, if you don't have that shirt on right now.  Right.  Forget about it.  Like, I'm an F-18 bro.  A shirt.  That's already, that's, how old is that?  Is that a shirt for the song?  Yeah.  Oh, I love that song.  It's a good song.  It's a good song.  You don't like that song?  It's not a song.  E-Rock, any thoughts on Charlie Sheen? 
[02:38:00]  You say he shook his head now.  I can't believe that the E-Rock controversy is picking up just as this Charlie Sheen controversy  is dipping.  Well, you're trying to keep it going.  We're actually trying to smooth everything up.  Oh, my God.  Sam, what a ham-handed approach.  We're trying to keep things calm.  We're trying to fucking get this thing, keep this thing going.  I thought we were talking about E-Rock.  Very ham-handed.  Was there any contact with management since this whole controversy started?  By the way, for the people that, you know, they tune in right about now, listen to the 
[02:38:30]  replay.  By the way, the first hour was terrific.  The first hour and 15 was great.  I got an anonymous tip that even management recognized what had happened today and passed  by and looked at another staff member and said, the beginning of today's show, oof.  Is that going to be bad?  Oh, no.  I did like, poor E-Rock.  What does that mean?  Oh, really?  The beginning of today's show, oof.  Because they all know.  Acknowledging that he was thrown under the bus to the point that he almost quit.  Is he garnering sympathy from management? 
[02:39:00]  I believe that's my theory.  Because he took such a beating?  Because he reacted so strongly to it that that will get him a lot of sympathy.  Oh, so what you're saying is his act this morning is going to work as far as management  goes because whatever he had put on.  Yeah, I didn't think it was an act at first.  I don't know.  It must have been.  Because it's a great defense.  It's a great defense.  Because everybody feels bad for him now.  All right.  You know, it's his 40th birthday. 
[02:39:30]  He's trying to celebrate.  And all of a sudden, you know, he's getting this.  E-Rock, I know you don't want to talk, but Sam's pushing this 40 thing.  Well, I don't know.  I don't have a birth certificate.  How does that make you feel?  You don't have to talk, but you could.  He flipped me off.  He's flipping you off.  I don't have his birth certificate.  How old is the E-Rock?  I don't, you know, I thought 40.  I would guess 38.  38?  Was that on the air or just to me?  Just to you.  I didn't hear it.  Oh, oh, I didn't hear it either.  I didn't hear it either.  Sweet nothings? 
[02:40:00]  Oof.  What did he say?  Oh, my God.  I would love to know what he said.  I think I heard 30-fucking-3.  Oh, the same age as Christ.  No, he just said 30-fucking-3.  No, he just said 33.  I'm not going to pump it up.  He's already so loud.  Same age as Belushi and Chris Farley.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, that was in the 27 Club.  No.  I know there was a 27 Club and there's a 33 Club.  33.  Yeah, Christ was in the 33 Club.  I'm going to guess Hendricks.  I'll tell you the 27.  I'll tell you the 27.  Who was in that? 
[02:40:30]  27s are easy.  You got the Kurt Cobain.  You got the Janis Joplin.  You got the Jim Morrison.  And you might have had the Hendricks.  Hendricks, too.  Was he 27?  Those were all the 27s that I know of offhand.  And I didn't know there was a 33, too.  I thought Hendricks was older than that.  Farley?  Yeah, I'm not sure about Hendricks.  I think Hendricks is 27.  Sam's saying that.  I'm going to.  He's right?  Okay.  33 is Farley, Belushi, Christ.  I should put JC first for Farley and Belushi.  Christ is a big one.  And there was another big one.  Yeah, but E-Rock is more in common with Belushi and Farley. 
[02:41:00]  Of course he does.  Oh, God damn.  They're all funny.  They're all funny people.  E-Rock.  E-Rock's got good jokes.  That's all I'm saying.  E-Rock, once again, you don't have to talk, but are we all in agreement that Sam is the biggest  asshole here?  I get a thumbs up.  Big thumbs up.  Big thumbs up.  How do you figure?  I want to apologize.  And we have said and done some shitty things to that man.  Yeah.  I think you're trying to skate away from some of the responsibility and push it onto me.  I get all caught up in the Sam thing, E-Rock, so I apologize.  Like, Sam has some kind of magical power. 
[02:41:30]  I get you all pumped up.  You do.  You do.  And it's very nasty.  It's very...  Is that where all those hero jokes came from?  Yes.  It's not...  You're not a nice person.  I think I'm nice.  Did E-Rock enjoy the pudding and the cake?  Oh, right.  E-Rock refused.  I said...  E-Rock, you gotta eat it.  We didn't bring it in.  So if you're still mad at us, Roland brought it in.  I said the cake is unbelievably good.  It was.  And E-Rock said, that's nice.  What did Roland do to you?  You can talk to me.  This is a start.  So good.  Don't just talk to Opie. 
[02:42:00]  All right.  Roland did nothing.  I have the pudding.  So you're going to enjoy the pudding.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, he's going to drink it like a shake.  Oh, God.  Because you're thirsty.  He said bathe in it.  So he's coming alive.  He's coming alive.  Well, why doesn't he talk to us?  I don't know.  I want to hear it, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, we all want to hear it.  Turn your mic on.  The listeners are very concerned.  They want to know.  They want to hear from you.  Maybe his throat still hurts from Ultimate Warrior Day yesterday.  We're calling it Ultimate Warrior Day.  I thought so.  I was very confused by that contest. 
[02:42:30]  The Ultimate Warrior contest?  Yeah, there's some trickery going on.  They were tricking me and Jimmy and just decided not to play it in the first round.  We tried.  I was very busy eating my wonderful soup.  Which led to your nap.  Which caused this whole thing.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, because that chicken does have, like turkey, has that shit in it.  Tryptophan.  That tryptophan.  Not enough to make you tired.  And I, oh, my God.  Well, maybe it was, you know.  Were you wearing tryptophan underpants?  It was staying up. 
[02:43:00]  Tiny foot.  My feet are tired.  Ew.  Bruce Lee, 33.  Oh, wow.  Thank you, Larry D. in Jamaica Plains, if that's true.  Okay.  Wow, that's a, wow.  So 33 is a big one and 27 is a big one.  Wow.  Eva Braun, 33.  Oh.  Well.  That's Kevin from Connecticut.  He's a good source.  Yeah, Hitler's broad.  Sorry to the listeners once again.  Ouch.  Which one?  Whoever had the Bruce Lee info. 
[02:43:30]  Not 33.  No.  Close, though.  32.  Uh, Wikipedia.  In your face.  One month.  July.  And when was his birthday?  November.  Boom.  All right.  It's all in freaking Chinese writing.  Yeah.  You read Chinese?  A lot of Chinese writing in there.  I thought you said Chinese.  He's a lot of Chinese.  Chinese.  Danny reads chinky.  I grew up in Flushing.  That's the language.  Yeah, it's true.  Flushing.  Oh, my God.  If you want to read any signs, you got to know something.  Oh, my God.  Damn.  I was talking about that the other day.  That's where my dad was fucking born and raised. 
[02:44:00]  Let's go to the three slash squiggly line store.  I have no idea how you figure out how to buy stuff there.  You don't.  They don't want you buying stuff there.  That's why the chinky.  I feel sorry for your mother.  Why is everybody contributing except E-Rock?  Oh, Sam.  I just want to hear his voice again.  It sounds good on the air.  I do, too.  It's bugging me that I can't hear E-Rock talk on his birthday.  I want to hear him so bad.  It's his own birthday.  I want to hear him.  Very nice of you.  Like, what's he getting?  Are you bringing him in a piece of cake?  And a whole bucket of banana pudding. 
[02:44:30]  Roland just needs someone to eat with.  Yeah, Roland just wants to eat more.  Oh, it's fucked up shit that happens here.  I know.  That we've never expressed.  It's just a lot of shit.  We've got two overeaters that hang out together.  And Roland feels very lonely right now.  Roland's pouring banana pudding into his juicer.  Yeah, exactly.  He's doing juice.  And then he's eating half of a fucking birthday cake.  He eats one meal a day.  It happens to be consisting of cake and pudding today.  Oh, my God.  Bon Scott, 33. 
[02:45:00]  Oh.  Are people now just mentioning Dead Rock Stars and saying 33?  E-Rock is not going to die.  And the ages will all be wrong.  I'm only going with the guys.  You forgot the T.  I'm only going with guys, Ant, that are reliable.  Bon Scott, 33.  Oh, what?  I said, I said, E-Rock is not going to die.  And then Jim said, you forgot the T, which spells diet.  I didn't mean that.  I meant tie-dye.  Oh.  Sorry, dude.  Holy shit.  It's his 33rd birthday. 
[02:45:30]  Happy.  Bon Scott, 33?  Yes.  All right.  Keith Moon is in the Bruce Lee category, 32.  Is he 32?  There's no 32 category.  When did E-Rock start with us?  How old was E-Rock?  That's not on Wikipedia.  When he started.  He started day one, October 2004.  Well.  So how old was E-Rock when?  Well, I met him at a rest area back then.  Oh, shit.  What year did we meet at the rest area?  He's smiling.  I saw him smile.  You can just talk to me.  Oh, come on. 
[02:46:00]  2003.  2003.  Wow.  I was wandering around the earth because we had no gig.  He got, it was a Cracker Barrel, but it was in a rest area.  Oh, Eric loves Cracker Barrel.  It's his favorite restaurant.  It's not a bad place.  So he was 25 years old when you met him?  Yeah, I was wandering around.  I had really long hair and I was down to.  Young lad of 25.  I was down to about 120 pounds.  I was in trouble.  Good thing you two didn't find a seesaw.  You know what?  Oh, come on.  You know what?  Fatty was pretty thin, too, back then. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, God.  Look at what you just called him.  What do you think's caused him to put on all the weight?  Could be stress.  This job-related stress.  E-Rock, how many pounds did this show put on you?  He's getting 30 pounds this morning.  And be honest.  Oh, he just did a math problem in front of him.  100 pounds.  When you ask that question about weight put on, it's supposed to bring out the calculator.  It's not good.  Yeah.  That's not that bad.  He got distracted because he had to use pie.  That's not bad.  He says 45 pounds. 
[02:47:00]  Yes.  In eight years.  Well, no, that's not true.  In eight years?  No, that's not true.  Fucking Sam.  What a prick.  I mean, I'm a sad.  E-Rock, you know.  Yeah.  Did you pad a couple pounds?  You were in the low 180s when we met?  Okay, so he was chubby when you met.  So he was already on his way.  He was on his way.  All right, so he can't blame us.  He already had issues.  He already had issues.  Roland, you all right?  Was that the boating years?  Oh, he loves his boat. 
[02:47:30]  Roland.  Pretty cool, huh?  Was that it?  40 years ago today, somewhere in Florida, young E-Rock was born.  40?  That's not 40.  Fucking Sam.  I don't have his birth certificate.  How could anyone know?  He's from Long Island, asshole.  What are you talking about?  Keith Richards, 33 when he died.  What?  Yep.  Keith Richards.  33 when he died.  When did that happen?  What?  Well, they replaced all his blood and stuff, but technically he died.  What about Paul McCartney? 
[02:48:00]  How old is he when he's supposedly?  33.  33?  Yep.  Sam Cooke, 33.  Oh, boy.  Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33.  And this is a bad way to start this year off for E-Rock.  Bill Hicks was 33?  John Bonham, 33?  All right, now they're just, I have no idea what's right anymore.  Are you listing the people who died at 33 on E-Rock's birthday?  David Carradine, 33.  33.  Wow.  That was a big one.  It was a terrible 33. 
[02:48:30]  Looked a little older than that, but he was 33.  Henry Fonda?  33.  So this morning you got E-Rock in trouble with the bosses, and then later on you inform  him that he's probably going to die this year?  Oh, God.  Abe Lincoln?  JFK.  JFK was 33, too.  Yep.  Are you serious?  And 33rd president.  Mm-hmm.  What?  Yeah.  That's incredible.  Scott Hamilton.  What?  Scott Hamilton's outside.  Who's that?  He's an ice skater, and he was on Celebrity Apprentice.  Oh, that's right.  He got voted off early, though. 
[02:49:00]  Hi, can I have a picture?  Hey, did you make that eight more than once?  Let's say hi to Chris in Texas.  Chris.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey, man.  I'm on CNN.  I'm watching a video right now.  Pizza guy, man.  He's putting mice in people's pizza.  No, he wasn't putting it in the pizza.  It was two pizza joints, I think, in the Philly area, right?  Oh, was it?  This fucking guy, the owner of the one place, wanted to get rid of the other pizza joints, 
[02:49:30]  so he went in there with a, or had one of his guys go in there with a sack filled with  mice, and he was releasing them in the pizza shop.  Oh, God.  Knowing the guy couldn't collect them all in time before they, you know, got behind the  walls.  Jesus.  Isn't that great?  Is this Bruce's pizza guy?  What?  Is this the same guy?  Didn't you call with the story?  Yeah, so that is a good point.  You did call with the story.  Yeah, you're the one that called with the story.  Yeah, wouldn't you know?  The guy's name is Joni from Pennsylvania, I assume.  He calls us to fact check.  Why don't you know? 
[02:50:00]  We're the fact checkers.  No, and then call back again.  Ouch.  All right.  All right.  How's the phoner?  How's touch and rest?  They say hello, and they're asking for you guys, and that's good.  What do they want from us?  We're asking?  They just were saying hi and describing how we first met, and they were always drunken.  Oh, yeah, that is true.  Oh, my God.  They knew how to drink.  Yeah, I know.  Or Fred did.  Yeah.  I don't know if the other guy was a drinker, but Fred certainly was.  Remember that party we went to, and he was fucking-  The first thing they talked about was how loaded he was. 
[02:50:30]  Was he fucking smashed?  Was it the Halloween thing?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  But you expect that on Halloween.  That's true.  But wow, he could put them back.  Does he still put them back?  I don't know.  I actually didn't ask him.  I'm imagining he does.  Yeah.  Sam Kinison, 33.  Thank you.  Was he only 33 when he died?  Yep.  Oh, my gosh.  You know how old the British Bulldog was when he died?  33.  That's correct.  You know who just popped into my head last night for no fucking reason? 
[02:51:00]  Iraq?  Because I was-  No.  I know why.  Because I-  Hitler?  UL.  That's what I said for no reason.  John Birch?  Sir Gantt.  Gangrel?  Was that his name?  Yes.  Because we were mentioning so many wrestlers, I guess, yesterday when we were talking about  the Ultimate Warrior.  Yeah.  And the various matches and who he was up against.  All I can think is dumb Gangrel.  Mick Foley had a great Gangrel story about him getting fired.  Really?  Because he used to wear, like, the baggy shirt. 
[02:51:30]  Oh.  And he said, Iraq got the Gangrel music fast.  Damn, Iraq.  I don't remember Gangrel.  He was the vampire.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm looking at pictures.  I don't remember.  He said, Mick Foley said, during a match, Gangrel's shirt came up, like, over his stomach  and his gut was hanging out over his tights.  And back in the backstage, Vince McMahon just goes, yeah.  And then fired him, like, a week later.  Yeah.  Fuck it, Vince Rules.  That's classic. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Gangrel came out to it.  Never quite caught on Gangrel.  They tried, though.  He came up from the floor with the fire around him.  Yeah, yeah.  They really came a lot.  It was before his time, really, if you think about it.  Yeah, because of Twilight and everything.  That angle would have went over, like, Gangbusters last year.  Gangrel Busters.  Yep.  That's what his crew could have been called.  He had Edge and Christian with him, both of which are now main event guys.  And he wrestles in gyms.  Oh.  Nah, it happens. 
[02:52:30]  It happens.  I just thought of him last night.  That's so random.  Yeah, yeah.  Just, I know, because I was like, what the fuck is Gangrel?  Look what it says above his name in the screencap.  Winner.  Winner.  Wow.  Winner.  Not true.  Not going to hear that today from Sheen.  Jason in Tampa has the rest of the pizza story.  Hey, guys.  So any of it, then.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  The pizza story.  I think I filled in some of the blanks, but I was half watching myself.  Well, yeah, what happened was the owner of a pizza joint brought three mice and a bag 
[02:53:00]  into the joint that had just opened, asked the manager where the bathroom was.  He went in the bathroom with his plastic bag in his hand.  The manager heard him banging around in there, so when he left, he went and looked.  He found footprints on the toilet, so he looked up in the ceiling thinking it was drugs or  something, found the bag with three mice in it.  There was two cops eating lunch in his joint, so he went out and gave the mice to the cops,  and they followed him across the street to his pizza joint and found him walking out  of his store with another bag with six more mice in it.  Oh, shit.  What was he doing with the mice? 
[02:53:30]  Trying to knock out...  He was trying to get a health violation against his...  Yeah, trying to knock out his competition.  The competing pizza place.  Right.  He was convinced they opened it to drive him out of business, and I guess he's a conspiracy  theorist, because there was two that had just opened recently, so he was trying  to drive the two competitors out of business.  So he had mice in his, or he's storing them somewhere?  No, he restored them.  He had them in a plastic bin.  He had bought them at a pet store for snake food.  He was going to dump them out into the other guy's store.  A couple different trips into this guy's store.  Hold on a second, sir.  E-Rock cannot be today's hero.  Why? 
[02:54:00]  Why?  Big headline on CNN.  Michael Vick, today's hero.  Why?  Just said it.  I don't know.  Oh.  Sorry, E-Rock.  Only one hero a day, E-Rock.  I have a lot of fights going on.  Did the other pizza guy threaten to tweak his little pink tomato nose?  Pizza guy wars.  Yeah, but this guy said...  That's funny.  Danny had a good joke about one hero a day.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  It went under the radar, and Sam wanted to make sure you guys heard it.  I just wanted to make sure people get credit for their joke. 
[02:54:30]  Is E-Rock okay with that one?  I don't think he heard it.  Because you guys said they're going to be one hero a day, and then...  Sorry, E-Rock.  And then Danny said E-Rock's probably pretty upset about that hero sandwich.  Gosh, that's a little rough.  Sorry about that, E-Rock.  Especially on his birthday.  Especially on his birthday.  Yeah.  And this guy thinks it was a conspiracy theory.  No.  Yeah, of course the guy opens up a pizza joint trying to knock the other pizzas out.  Of course.  All right, we're going to take our last break, and then we'll finish up the show next, and 
[02:55:00]  I think we'll get E-Rock to talk on the show next.  We've got to at least get one word out of you.  E-Rock, we haven't been able to do any fucking material today, because it's been all about  you today.  Yes, it has been.  It's the birthday show for you.  It's your birthday.  That's right.  You're the birthday kid.  Look at you.  Look at you.  As he said, whatever gets you to fucking 10 o'clock.  Well.  He did say that.  Getting there, E-Rock.  We're almost there.  Although at 9.30, I mean...  Well, he could certainly help us get there easily. 
[02:55:30]  How's that?  By just, like, giving us material after the fucking...  Maybe he could do a virus bin or something.  Oh, yeah.  Would you talk in character?  Oh, that would be good.  I bet Tank Hangeris is not man.  Tank Hangeris.  We don't have to talk to E-Rock today, but can we talk to one of your characters?  Tank Hangeris is probably not man at all.  Maybe Tank could wish E-Rock a very happy birthday today.  Tank's used to craziness, though.  He can handle it.  Yeah, I think Tank can handle it.  If not Tank, then the Ultimate Warrior may be.  Can you see if Tank would say happy birthday to E-Rock today? 
[02:56:00]  Would you like to see him doing Tank?  Would I?  I would love it if Tank made an appearance today.  Oh, my God.  It would fucking rule.  I mean, that would definitely win the hero title back for Michael Vick.  Right.  You don't have to look at anyone.  No.  I mean, Tank doesn't have to look at anyone.  Push that hat way low.  What if Tank Hangeris just talks in Opie's headphones?  No.  He's got to talk to everybody at this point.  I wish he would.  I know I met him at a rest area, but I mean...  Yeah.  Enough?  Enough already.  He should be talking to everybody. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  We'll finish up the show next.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  On the fire.  Serious XMXM.  Dummies.  Opie and Anthony.  Hell of a day, man.  I got to tell you.  Hell of a day.  It has been right from the get-go.  We had a little race car kind of start here today. 
[02:57:00]  Yep.  Yeah.  Make sure you listen to the replay.  Some good stuff.  Hey, what's Charlie Sheen up to and Twitter followers?  Anything new?  When we started the show, he was at 603...  766, 953.  No, he's just rocking through the 700s.  Like, it's nothing.  He's just...  He'll have a million by noon.  Yes.  I'll get it for you in a second. 
[02:57:30]  I was just incredibly distracted by this Michael Jackson dancing game that they're whoring on  the Today Show right now.  Oh, no.  And they have to dance?  The guy's dead.  Yeah, yeah.  He's dead.  It is a little odd.  But that's still you all alone.  And that's the woman that was so pissed off at Charlie Sheen.  Oh, you missed that, Jimmy.  He's still in the Michael Jackson dead from drugs.  You see the girl shaking her ass?  She was the one that was outraged by the Charlie Sheen controversy.  Well, the big dance they're pushing is the Propofol Shuffle.  It's where you go, uh... 
[02:58:00]  I should have just quit while I was ahead.  It's where you just go home after a bomb, Jim.  There's a weekend at Bernie's joking there somewhere, right?  Did you see all the black guys doing the weekend at Bernie's dance?  Oh, yeah.  It's pretty fucking funny, to be honest.  It's hysterical.  Charlie's up to 767.  Yeah.  Okay.  Bernie.  Doing a Bernie.  Doing a Bernie.  Yeah, Charlie Sheen.  You know, his kids got taken away, so now he's talking completely normal,  and he's not doing any of those gnarly-isms.  You know, he wants his kids back, and then they went to the woman, 
[02:58:30]  and she's so pissed off.  It was on her face.  Yeah, she was all like...  So fucking pissed.  The reporter.  She's just like...  Fuck the reporter.  Like, disgusted with him.  The guy's just going with it.  It's just another story, but it's deep for her for some reason.  She goes, well, maybe he shouldn't go on shows like Howard Stern then  and talk about how he has two beds,  and he sleeps with two different girls.  Who the fuck are you to say that?  What about your business, bitch? 
[02:59:00]  And then they just showed her,  and now she's shaking her ass for the new Michael Jackson video game.  It's like, A, they're just exploiting a dead person for money.  Right, right.  B, he's fucking fingering kids when he's alive.  Right.  And this is okay.  This is what we're all tap dancing around to,  spending $50 on our gaming systems at home.  Yeah, that's why I find the news fascinating,  because they're all a bunch of fucking hypocrites and dicks.  Yes, but I told the people, as the Charlie Sheen story continues,  watch how mad all the female anchors and reporters are.  Yeah, it's not like the guys that report on it. 
[02:59:30]  Or the fucking, you know, you read Twitter,  and everyone's crazy for them.  And then the reporters are just,  oh, they're so good.  They're too good.  Let me say how Cali looks like in Oregon.  Hey, what's going on?  Do you guys say Oregon or Oregon?  Oregon or Oregon?  No, it's Oregon.  All right.  Jimmy was there.  That's why you're calling.  What's up?  Yeah, I saw the great Jimmy Norton in concert last week.  It was awesome.  I mean, he absolutely killed it for the, like, 34 people that were there. 
[03:00:00]  Thanks, man.  Oh, jeez.  No, he's right, though.  It was very small crowds.  But that club was fucking phenomenal to perform in.  I just performed for an intimate crowd every so often.  It's a brand new club, too, right?  Yeah, I just didn't draw.  He was absolutely awesome.  It was a little creepy.  You might have sold more merch if PubStore to Kenny isn't out there going merch.  Merch.  And the other people were yelling back at him, lurch, lurch.  Get it?  Because he's big and stupid.  And then I was in church yelling, I'm in charge. 
[03:00:30]  Church.  Oh, chip.  I got a bunch.  I was searching for something.  Oh, go ahead.  Go ahead, buddy.  I'm sorry.  Someone tells me he was done.  Go ahead.  Continue.  What?  When you guys are on out here on the West Coast, that's a podcast every day.  But I...  What did he say?  Something about up in a hill, a podcast every day. 
[03:01:00]  I guess we were technically on in Portland.  We were on a very...  I think it was a tiny AM station or something.  Oh, right, right, right.  I think.  Yeah.  We didn't have a draw out there at all.  No.  What is your point?  I buy you guys on Audible every year, so I get you all year, and I have XM just for you  guys, so we've got at least one chance.  Do we promote audible.com?  We should.  There used to be an Audible promo.  Because we get a little taste of that, at least.  I think we get a little taste.  A little something. 
[03:01:30]  I think we get a half of a percent or something.  Pocket money?  It's pocket money.  We get some pocket money.  Yeah, if you're too stupid for Torrance, you can just go to audible.com.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  You don't know how to steal it.  All right, Callie or Collie or whatever.  I don't know what you accomplished with your phone call, but we thank you for calling.  I'd say slim to nothing.  I had a question.  Sure.  Question, question and answer.  Why didn't you start with that?  Because I'm an idiot.  All right.  Good point, sir. 
[03:02:00]  Jimmy did something he said he'd never done before in a show.  He broke a glass on stage and a waitress came up to clean it up and he looked at her  like he wanted to rip her head off.  Were you really that pissed off at her?  I wasn't mad at her at all.  No, I was on stage at a coffee cup.  I was drinking coffee and it tipped over on the table and just fell and broke.  But no, I wasn't mad at her, dude.  Not at all.  And what?  She came up during your set?  To clean it up?  Yeah, but she didn't want me stepping in broken glass.  No, it was just...  She didn't know what to do.  No, I wasn't mad at her at all, actually.  Okay. 
[03:02:30]  I'm just a really good actor.  Did everyone laugh?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's a moment.  Yeah, it was funny.  It's a little different.  Oh, by the way, were you at the show, the Saturday early show, I had a party of 18 thrown out?  Can we do this without them?  I prefer it.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  Godspeed.  Get home safe.  Yeah.  There's a party of 18.  I don't know if any of them are listening.  And they were Twittering me like, hey, we're coming to see your show.  And they were yapping the whole show.  Nobody ever thinks they're talking when they're asked to leave.  And apparently it was somebody's birthday. 
[03:03:00]  But they kept being distracting.  And I would see audiences, members looking over at them.  So I finally go, what's going on?  Can you stop?  And the woman kept going, it's his birthday.  I'm like, I don't give a shit.  But they were trying to have fun, but they were being distracting.  And there was a great show and a great set.  But then eventually they got asked to leave.  I didn't even know they got asked to leave.  I just looked over, I'm like, were they thrown out?  And the people were like, yeah, they all cheered.  And then they're Twittering like they're mad at me.  It's like, fuck you.  How self-centered are people? 
[03:03:30]  Do you really think that the club just wanted to throw out 18 people for no reason?  You fucking dopes.  18 people, Jesus.  And then the guy Twitter, sorry, you're such a pussy.  You can't handle one crying girl.  A, I didn't know she was crying.  B, it's not my fucking problem.  If during my show, a woman is crying.  If she has a legitimate reason to be crying.  During sex, it's a different story.  Of course, I can't stay hard if there's no tears.  I'm like, you mind if I put an onion under your nose? 
[03:04:00]  Or my balls, as it were, which smell worse?  If you don't mind an onion with crabs falling off.  But it's like, this is how fucking selfish people are.  Like, instead of going, wow, that was distracting.  This guy Twittered, sorry, I'm a pussy.  I can't, first of all, maybe you're the pussy who can't handle your woman and tell her to shut up.  Or how about you take her outside?  What, do you need Michael there, Fredo?  What, do you need Michael there?  Holy fucking shit, though.  I hate people, the self-centeredness of people, to think that your 18 people are more important than that. 
[03:04:30]  That was the biggest crowd I had, was that Saturday early show.  And of course they're outside.  If he was funny, we wouldn't have been talking.  No.  Oh, really?  You motherfuckers.  Take responsibility for the fact that you are fucking drunk.  How about once people go, you know what, we were a little drunk and whatever, we talked too much.  Got out of hand.  Is this getting personal with me?  How about once?  What are you saying?  We're just waiting.  One time would be nice.  I don't like when you guys yell at me like, is this intervention? 
[03:05:00]  Yes, it is.  They never do, though.  Do they never say that we were talking during the show?  It's never you, is it?  It's just the club being dicks.  Let's get rid of 18 people for no reason.  Yeah, they want to throw that out.  No, you weren't talking.  We were picking on you.  Idiots.  And they obviously know you're funny, and they went to the show.  Of course they do.  But then they got to turn it around that quickly.  The fuck out of here.  It was so annoying.  And I've been to a million Jimmy shows, and you allow the fans to have a good time. 
[03:05:30]  Yes.  But when it gets to a point where you're actually distracting Jimmy on stage, you got to go.  And they were distracting the audience, and I didn't even ask for them to be thrown out.  But how about for once, people who are being disruptive, man the fuck up once.  And admit to yourself you are being disruptive.  How about one time?  Does that mean you're going to be banning the air horns this weekend?  No, I prefer them, actually.  They help with punchlines.  Whenever there's a pause, I like an air horn sound.  I thought you were going to ruin it for everyone else. 
[03:06:00]  We're allowed to bring our air horns this Saturday night in Jersey?  Yes.  But they weren't even talking today.  Dude, that would have been less distracting than what they were doing.  They were literally just talking amongst each other.  And the girls, I don't care what was going on in her personal life.  Had she just walked outside and talked about it at the bar area with her friends, that's one thing.  But when you're doing it in the show, I'm supposed to fucking, you selfish assholes, change the entire room, should give a fuck about your personal problems? 
[03:06:30]  What was the personal problem?  Don't know or care.  Don't know or care.  We got a guy that was in the audience.  Brian in Portland.  Brian.  See, I didn't know if it would have been Jimmy's preference for somebody like me to know how to fucking watch a show to stand up and say,  Shut the fuck up!  Well, dude, when I asked the audience...  I was a big indie and I told you we run the past page on Facebook.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I remember you, yeah. 
[03:07:00]  Would I have been allowed to stand up and say, Shut the fuck up?  Because I realize that you don't make a practice of that.  Can I answer for Jimmy?  Sure.  If you're getting the feeling that you need to stand up and yell, Shut the fuck up to somebody, then, yeah, do it.  Because that shows that the audience is getting pissed off and it's not just me.  When the audience is distracted, it makes my punchlines not work as well because they're hearing chatter.  Yeah, they thought it was fucking...  Chatter.  They thought it was fucking...  What's that gay show people go to and participate in? 
[03:07:30]  A dinner theater?  I don't know, sir.  That's an open question.  I don't know the guys from...  Glory, Holton, Banat.  Sorry.  I fucked it up.  God damn it.  Rip Rappery.  Damn it.  Oh, you know what?  Oh, boy.  All right.  I'll say...  Let me say to the girl...  Uh-oh.  She got a hold of you right now?  No.  I didn't really...  They had Twittered me.  Her name is Nicole. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, she had an abortion.  And one night...  Oh, God.  It was an abortion, wasn't it?  She Twittered one night, me and 17 of my friends are coming to see you on Saturday for my birthday.  Super excited.  And then a couple days later, you know I brought 18 people to your show and I got kicked out.  Bullshit.  You suck.  Oh, shit.  But, then the next day, I did not see this.  She said, Jim Norton, it wasn't your fault.  I just got blamed.  I already punched it out.  Hold on.  She writes, it wasn't your fault.  I just got blamed for shit I didn't do.  Sorry about last night.  So, you know what? 
[03:08:30]  I apologize for implying that you didn't man up or adult up and take responsibility.  You did and I didn't know it.  So, cool.  Fair enough.  That's great.  Yes, I like that attitude.  Let me just see if the other guy she was with did and then I will be completely – oh, he's not on Twitter anymore.  Okay.  All right.  Well, forget it.  Thank you, Nicole, for writing that.  So, don't kill Nicole on Twitter because she actually did say something like it was her – and she apologized. 
[03:09:00]  That's all.  She probably knew the wrath was going to come down.  But, no, I just didn't read it.  I didn't get to – I just hadn't read that.  All right.  Well, my favorite show is on TV right now.  Yay.  Now, just in time for Mardi Gras.  Whoopin'.  So, happy birthday to Karen.  Yeah, she's a sweetheart.  I sent her flowers.  She loved them.  They were huge.  With the scoop.  This is their segment called The Scoop.  The flowers were at the Oscar party.  They were so big to decorate.  Really?  Yes.  They're crazy.  They drink wine on TV.  Did you send your best friend some flowers? 
[03:09:30]  It should be where they scoop their useless uteruses out of them.  How do you get to be a part of this party?  I mean, this is, you know – how do you get on this big wagon?  All right.  Like your husband did.  Remember?  When he was on the front page, lose 50 years on your age.  Anyway, the story today is that Charlie Sheen's kids were away from him.  Yeah, I don't think so.  No.  I don't think so.  They do it then.  Look at your daughter.  His – well, his ex-wife –  This is the scoop.  Oh, let's hear their act.  Oh, look out. 
[03:10:00]  By saying something like he was going to put her head in a box and send it to her mother.  Yeah.  So, she said that was a threat.  So, she called the police.  The police came to the house and took the two young kids.  And –  You know he said that, right?  I think that was a question a lot of people had.  Like, those two kids are living in that house.  Apparently, it was his time for custody, though.  Right.  According to his attorney.  And I think what was surprising was seeing that the girls, the two women who are his girlfriends –  The goddesses, Hoda, porn stars, were babysitting the children, too, and all that.  A lot of people have asked that question.  Is that appropriate?  And are they capable of taking care of children? 
[03:10:30]  I mean, they probably are capable of it, but are they?  Well, today, Jeff Rosson had yet another interview.  Golly, Dave.  With Charlie.  And he was talking about the kids.  So, let's listen to this.  All right.  We heard all that already.  Now, I'm reading this jerk-off's Twitter.  Yeah, go ahead.  And he's just a jerk-off.  The guy – it's on Twitter.  Okay.  He's just a jerk-off.  Just a baby.  The girl he was with was actually nice, so she's fine.  He's taking no responsibility?  Nah, he's a twat.  That he disrupted the – 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, nah, just a twat.  Just a twat.  Just a twat.  Okay.  Just a fucking twat.  Not his fault.  Not his fault.  Dude, I go to comedy shows all –  Well, you got thrown the fuck out.  Bye.  Fucking asshole.  You got thrown the fuck out, Neil.  Bye.  And it was obvious, right, Jimmy?  Dude, I heard them –  Before I went on, I heard chatter coming from the –  Of course they'll deny it.  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  Yes, I did. 
[03:11:30]  God forbid he should man the fuck up and admit –  If you can't handle your liquor, then don't go out to a public place and drink, shithead.  Fuck you.  He stays home.  I gotta agree with him.  Ant stays home.  Yes.  He does.  But Ant's not a drunk and annoying asshole when he's out.  Ant doesn't fucking –  No, not when I'm sober.  Jesus.  And now he's trying to fight back all these people smashing him on Twitter.  What a twat.  What a fucking baby. 
[03:12:00]  How about this, baby?  You fucking talked and you got booted.  Baby.  I don't care what –  Someone said they were a bunch of cops.  I don't know if they were or not, but I really don't care what their job title is.  Whoever they were, they were assholes and they were yapping.  And then he goes in one, we got thrown out because people complained.  Yeah.  What the fuck does that tell you?  It's what happens.  Why would people complain about people being tired?  They were all wrong.  Yeah.  How about you man up and handle your fucking situation at the table? 
[03:12:30]  How about you do that?  I'm a pussy because I can't handle –  I can handle anything in an audience.  I was on stage when a fucking –  At the cellar when a fight broke out upstairs and we heard tables being thrown.  Really?  And I emceeded from fucking underneath.  Believe me.  I can handle anything.  I've been heckled.  I've fucking had stuff thrown.  I've fucking had – all kinds of shit happen.  So can Michael Richards.  Exactly.  He handles it better than any of us.  God rest his soul.  You know, he's not good.  God rest his 30 days.  But he's trying to fight. 
[03:13:00]  He's trying to fight back.  If he didn't laugh, if he didn't have a good time, well, then why did you stay for 40 minutes of the show?  Yeah.  Again, be a man and say, you know what?  I'm not enjoying this.  I'm going to go outside and drink, or I'm just going to leave.  This isn't my cup of tea.  The show was killing.  If I didn't have a good show, I would tell you guys.  Yeah.  Really annoys me.  Now the feedback on the show is great.  So –  Where are we going Saturday, Jimmy?  Where are we going?  Well, hopefully more folks will come to the theater in Montclair called the Wellmont. 
[03:13:30]  Tickets on sale now.  And Friday, my interview with Lemmy will be on my Boneyard show.  Nice.  What a fucking baby this guy is.  What a fucking baby.  What a dick.  Can't handle this.  Who knows, you know, what's happening in there.  You know what I'm talking about.  According to the goddesses, a lot.  Right, yes.  All right.  So, Lindsay Lohan, she, too, was out there. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, they're dishing the dirt.  Dishing the dirt on Lindsay.  What's Lilo up to?  He's getting very sober about her situation.  What she says is – I don't know if we have sound, but she does say that she wants to  get back into movies.  She wants to focus on her great work, but she doesn't want all the attention to be paid  to her hair and things like that.  Well, I'm sure she does.  The trouble is she's got a lot of work to do to make herself, you know –  Marketable.  More than that, palatable to a producer who's willing to pay for the insurance it's going 
[03:14:30]  to take on her.  Yeah, yeah.  And I think a lot of people are still pulling.  Who's watching?  Like we did for Britney.  Besides us.  Do we sound like this?  No.  Oh, God.  I think we sound like this.  Oh, my God.  I remember meeting her when she was at 12 when she did that movie.  Why?  When did we go through menopause?  Holy shit.  What do you expect from a show called Cunt and Blithering?  So, I don't know.  In the morning.  She's 43.  Yeah, Cunt and Blithering.  Well, it's interesting because it seems like we've been watching this conga line of celebs  who are falling.  And the other –  Stars Gone Wild.  Yeah, Christina Aguilera. 
[03:15:00]  I know.  And then what's his name?  The designer for John Galliano.  John Galliano.  Saying that horrible remarks he made.  Yeah, terrible.  Antisemitic stuff.  So, it was for –  Says, I love Hitler.  You know, just separated herself from this.  People like you would be dead today.  I think the thing is –  I mean, the question is, have people always behaved badly?  Now we have more ways to peek into it with watching and seeing everything with Twitter  and Facebook.  Everybody's got a phone.  No, it's a brand new phenomenon, stupid.  Blithers couldn't vote until the 60s.  What do you think? 
[03:15:30]  And so –  Get the fuck up.  You weren't allowed to vote until what?  He was outbursts when he was drunk.  Inside the 20s.  20s.  Just the way –  Repeal that one.  Gibson basically did.  So, that begs the question, is that what you really think when all of the restrictions  Basically took it away from him?  Oh, yeah.  Is her husband just ass-fucking?  Yes, ass-fucking the hooker in the fucking hotel room.  No.  What do you think?  I think if you were to chuck a bottle of wine right now –  Well, it was on the front page of the fucking post when it happened.  I don't think any of the – I can't imagine any of that stuff coming. 
[03:16:00]  No matter how –  Who's watching these hens besides us?  We are.  I was.  I would never say the kind of stuff that you're reading here.  Yes, you would.  You're a liar.  I think you have to have to give you an order.  She was drunk off her ass.  She's probably mouthed off some horrible shit about people.  Pinsky called it, Dr. Drew, hypo –  Oh, Lord.  What's it?  Hypo-mania.  Hypo-cuntism?  Hypo-mania.  Do we have a description of that?  I saw that on Broadway.  Yes, hypo-mania is what he says he has, and I'm not sure if that's a long time ago.  This is TV, I guess, huh?  This is what people watch.  That's what people watch?  Is that regular television? 
[03:16:30]  Because I don't watch it anymore.  I've never seen this.  I really don't.  Because we're usually on our way home.  I watch documentaries in Top Shot.  We have a prescription for this.  What is this?  That's what Chuck Lorre was saying.  If he doesn't live longer, then he's going to kill himself.  He's going to be very, very upset.  All right.  So here's the two things that you need to do if you want to live longer, according to  the study.  Two things only.  You need to not retire, and you need to be active.  And eat broth.  Oh, my God.  Seriously?  Is this a show?  I would have never thought that.  Are they auditioning for something?  They think you have a certain disposition and you're happy. 
[03:17:00]  That doesn't necessarily mean a long life.  They think you'll live longer than people who are happy.  You mean you'll live longer if you're active and doing things?  Really?  That's for telling everybody.  I think it's nice in the morning to wake up and have a purpose.  That's important.  Is this SNL?  Is this one of their bits or something?  I don't know what this is.  I think you need joy in your life.  Yeah.  And unfortunately, our culture defines success in terms that are, I think, false. 
[03:17:30]  I mean, I look at somebody like Charlie Sheen and people think he's so successful.  Right.  Yes, he has a lot of money and he lives in a big mansion.  But I see success as an inner thing where...  Really?  Like a fucking 30 facelifts and a fucking...  Big huge, big huge tits?  Yeah.  Like tits?  Inner thing?  Yeah, with your fucking...  Is that real hair color she has?  No.  Where's all the inner success then?  You fucking pull back face, stupid.  Sorry, Hoda, but that's what it is.  And by the way, she's a multi-millionaire.  Yeah.  How old is she?  Yeah. 
[03:18:00]  I love it when she has a good idea.  Oh, look, they're going to drink now.  Only doing this because it's wine's day.  But you know what, Hoda?  There's another way...  Wine's day?  This is a morning zoo show.  Holy shit, it's insane.  It's wine's day.  Yeah, I do not need another way to get it.  She's fucking 58 years old with fucking blonde hair and pulled back face.  58 trying to look like she's in her 30s.  And I wonder if she still smells hooker shit on her husband's dick.  Is that success?  Is that success, really?  I bet you it still smells like hooker shit.  Yeah.  Your son's a big success. 
[03:18:30]  You know when you get a little duty under your nails, it stays there for a few days.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, probably still...  Right under the big mushroom head, it probably still smells...  When she grabs the gift's fucking shriveled old cock.  Oh, she's going to put it on all day long.  I like it.  It's available at Sephora and support.  Yeah, she's a multi-millionaire doing pretty much what Charlie's doing.  I'm fascinated with this show.  According to this study, you should have a lot of liquids so that your bladder's completely full. 
[03:19:00]  They say we make better choices and decisions in life when our bladder's full.  And we don't have time to think.  You just go with your gut instinct because you have to go.  So that's what they say.  So we've got to keep our bladders full.  We've got to stay active.  Not retire.  Keep our bladders full.  It's like my husband wears diapers at home, so that's okay.  He can piss any time.  She makes the best decisions ever.  I've never seen a person's leg shake so much in my life.  She just waits forever.  I know.  She has to go over 10 seconds.  The other thing, too, is... 
[03:19:30]  Sorry.  But the other thing, too, is they were saying...  I've got to remember to remind me to drive home down that road.  ...coming up who were crazy, crazy.  Because I'm pretty sure it's...  We want to tell you really quick about this.  That's the way I go home.  This is not what it sounds like.  I could go one street over, and I just stop the Escalade right in front of that window  they're at and just beep and yell, shut the fuck up.  For one, if you just let it go for a long time.  No, the other one is.  They say it takes four weeks.  If you shampoo regularly, it takes four weeks of not shampooing your hair... 
[03:20:00]  I'll just come through that window with my truck.  We're shampooing too long.  Did you know that?  What?  We're shampooing too often.  Who's in the control room?  Somebody you love.  Nobody.  They all went home.  They're all fucking asleep.  He needs to be in there more.  I'm voting for Steve Lucas to be our permanent director.  What person?  Oh, shit.  Now she did it.  You guys know that Jim Gaines has been mean to me since every day practically I'm on this. 
[03:20:30]  Jim is here.  I love Jim Gaines.  Oh!  Oh, crazy.  Jim Gaines has made her hair look crazy.  That's insane.  Yeah, I did say hooker dick.  I had a little bird taste in there.  Hooker dick.  I did say that.  We love.  We're wild about it.  He has to be with us.  Harry Connick Jr.  He's got big news on a Broadway front, too.  Does he?  Is he still pissed off at Australia?  That passes as TV.  Unbelievable.  That was amazing.  Oh, look. 
[03:21:00]  It's Scott Hamilton.  Wasn't he just here?  He was just here.  There he is now.  Wasn't he just skating down the hall?  Doing something else.  What a gang.  All right.  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  I don't even know what that was.  Is anybody waiting outside?  Can we make a...  No, we're making a dash for it today.  All right.  Make a mad dash.  All right, guys.  Thanks, man.  We'll see you.  Love ya.  The opening show of the virus.  Sirius XM.  I don't know. </pre>
