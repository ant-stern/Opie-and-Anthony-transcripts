<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a raucous opening featuring repeated announcements punctuated by fart jokes and crude banter from Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, who introduced themselves with offensive self-deprecating humor.  The conversation quickly moved to a discussion of the NFL, focusing on the poor performance of the Jets and Patriots, the controversial officiating due to the replacement referees, and a viral video of "Baltimore Batman" running onto the field. They dissected the excessive length of games and the overwhelming amount of on-screen graphics, discussing specific player injuries (Darrelle Revis) and questionable coaching decisions (Mark Sanchez).  A significant portion was dedicated to reviewing clips of Baltimore Batman and the Ravens-Patriots game, including the close field goal and Bill Belichick's reaction.

The show then transitioned to the Emmy Awards, mentioning winners Louie C.K. (whose Portuguese-dubbed acceptance speech was played), Eric Stonestreet, and Aaron Paul (all past guests). The hosts heavily criticized *The Big Bang Theory*, comparing its popularity unfavorably to their preferred shows like *30 Rock*, *Community*, and *Parks and Recreation*, highlighting the disparity in viewership and debating show quality. *Two and a Half Men* and John Cryer's Emmy win were also discussed, along with Ricky Gervais's interaction with Louie C.K.  They analyzed Emmy clips, including a *Big Bang Theory* clip played without a laugh track to expose its reliance on it.  The discussion concluded with further commentary on television viewership and preferences.  Jim Norton was the only guest explicitly mentioned in the studio during this initial segment.

The show continued with a discussion about the Emmy Awards, specifically criticizing the lack of a dedicated stand-up comedy category and the perceived unfairness of the competition.  The hosts commented on Glenn Weiss's Emmy win and Louis C.K.'s loss.  They then delved into a listener-submitted blog post proposing an alternative interpretation of *The Sopranos*' final episode, suggesting Tony Soprano was killed.  This theory was analyzed in detail, referencing camera angles, David Chase's interviews, and plot points.

A comedic bit with Billy the Bassman promoting his new CD was included, followed by a discussion of Nirvana's *Nevermind* 21st anniversary.  A viral video featuring a woman named Rachel (details unspecified) was briefly discussed, followed by a promotional segment for the action movie *Livewire*. A humorous reading from the "Book of Ted" was also featured.

Frequent caller E-Rock joined the show, detailing his weekend where he watched the Emmys while his wife watched football, sparking a conversation about gender roles and differing interests.  The Emmy Awards' "manicam" was discussed, along with a recounting of a confrontation between comedians Joe DeRosa and Troy Kwan, with Troy Kwan joining the show to briefly describe the events.

The following segment began with a discussion of favorite stand-up comedians (Bill Burr, Patrice O'Neal, Jim Norton, and Amy Schumer), quickly shifting to the physical altercation between Troy and Joe DeRosa.  The hosts detailed the events, including Joe DeRosa's use of the word "livelihood," which became a recurring joke.  They discussed the negative fan reaction on Twitter.  The conversation then turned to Billy Joe Armstrong's outburst at the iHeartRadio Music Festival, playing audio of his profanity-laced rant.  They speculated on the reasons for his behavior. The hosts also discussed an interview one of them conducted with a radio personality from Columbus, Ohio, and a listener's call mentioning Jimmy Norton's successful stand-up shows there.

Jimmy Norton's trip to Columbus was discussed, including his emotional reaction to the movie "End of Watch."  This led to a tangent about dine-in movie theaters, comparing them to Yakov Smirnoff's dinner theater.  Jimmy Norton shared an annoying song stuck in his head.  The conversation returned to the new iPhone 5, discussing Apple's sales, stock price, and perceived artificial scarcity. A Samsung Galaxy S3 commercial mocking the iPhone 5 was mentioned, along with discussions about jailbreaking iPhones and the Apple-Samsung rivalry. The segment concluded with further discussion of the iPhone 5, its maps application, and a "F-U Line" phone call segment, including a humorous exchange about bananas.

A subsequent segment focused on the new Apple Maps and iPhone 5, compared to Google Maps and Samsung phones.  Callers and hosts compared features, particularly focusing on mapping applications.  The comedic frustration with Apple Maps' limitations (lack of public transportation, reliance on satellite imagery) was a recurring theme.  The hosts' disbelief that one of them didn't know about a map feature became a running joke.  The comparison broadened to include Apple and Samsung phones generally, including discussion of the Samsung Note 2's size and stylus. A caller discussed their experience with the Galaxy S3.

A tangent discussed a viral video of "Rachel," a woman interviewed by a staffer (Sam) while waiting for the iPhone 5.  Rachel’s simple answers and odd mannerisms became a recurring joke.  The hosts speculated about future technological advancements, including real-time surveillance and thought-based communication, leading to humorous and offensive discussions about privacy and social interactions.  Finally, a caller recommended the Waze navigation app.


A lengthy interview with a young female intern, Dana, from the Ron and Fez show followed.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy engaged in sexually suggestive and offensive conversation with her, covering her dating life, parents' divorce, views on celebrities (including the Jersey Shore cast and Art Garfunkel), and sexual experiences.  Crude jokes and sexually explicit questions were frequent.  Who Kid, a DJ who worked with 50 Cent, joined the show.  The conversation shifted to his experiences working with 50 Cent, including an anecdote about a DJ being stabbed at 50 Cent's studio. Racial slurs and offensive language were used frequently. Cyndi Lauper and Eric LeGrand were also mentioned.  The hosts discussed their personal lives and preferences using vulgar language.


The final segment featured Who Kid as the main guest.  The conversation focused heavily on his sexual exploits, boasting about encounters with women, including group sex with celebrities.  Specific details were shared about encounters with Ron Jeremy, Nelly, and G-Unit members.  A photograph of Who Kid and Ron Jeremy engaging in a sexual act was discussed, along with his experiences at the AVN Awards and encounters with women at events with Dennis Hoff of the Bunny Ranch.

Condom use was discussed frankly and explicitly, along with Who Kid’s use of Viagra and descriptions of sexual acts.  The topic shifted to transsexual individuals, with Who Kid and the hosts recounting their encounters.  Highly offensive language and graphic descriptions of sexual acts were used throughout.  Who Kid's YouTube and social media content was mentioned, and a caller briefly joined near the end. The segment concluded with the hosts transitioning to the next show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now.  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  What ever before has one radio show been so extreme? 
[00:03:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now.  Opie and Anthony show starts now.  Opie and Anthony show starts now.  Who just farted?  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start. 
[00:04:00]  Like rotten eggs and sew it.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  Are we on the air?  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  The only show in the air?  The only show in the history of broadcasting.  The only show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Rules are destroyed.  And convention burns and grow. 
[00:04:30]  Would you like to make some fucking sugar?  Woo!  With Opie the destroyer.  Just pay us, you assholes!  I will continue.  Anthony the Rage.  Shut the fuck up.  Come to my pool and drown in it.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horns should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in dicks.  This one's gonna hurt. 
[00:05:00]  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning.  Here we are.  Here we are.  Yes.  Ladies and gents.  Lads and lassuses.  Hey everyone.  Hello.  How's everyone doing?  Monday.  You know. 
[00:05:30]  Got a case of the Mondays.  Mondays.  Mondays.  Mondays.  Mondays.  Fuck!  Wake up!  I finished the Bin Laden book.  You did?  I wish we had gotten that guy.  Did he do it?  How does it end?  The Bin Laden harm self.  It was great, dude.  Yeah.  What happened?  We were supposed to get the guy and he backed out.  Did you feel the pressure?  No, I think he was getting sued.  I believe the State Department is suing him.  Sue everyone.  Is that book gonna come out?  Oh, it's out. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  But if he's getting sued, are they taking it off the shelves?  No, I think that he just, maybe he didn't want to say anything else in interviews that  would, he wouldn't have a case.  Right, sure.  But it was so good, man.  Of course.  I would imagine it would be good.  Very interesting.  Stupid Jets won ugly against the Dolphins.  Did you watch, Anthony?  You watch any football?  Nine.  No, I'm just...  You watch any red zone?  You do anything with the football?  I'm willing to confess that I am a faggot when it comes to football.  You just can't get into it, huh? 
[00:06:30]  I just don't really like, if I have nothing to do and a game is on and I turn my head  and there it is, I'll watch it, you know?  It's kind of fun to watch like that, but I don't care.  I don't care who wins or loses.  And the amount of people that do care is amazing to me.  Well, they care because they got their fantasy football teams.  I know.  They gotta watch.  They gotta watch all these games.  They gotta watch their players.  They gotta follow stats on their little laptops.  I've noticed... 
[00:07:00]  For the trophy.  They're going for their trophy.  Yeah.  Sundays are amazing on Twitter because it just turns into a football frenzy.  Sure.  And I've also noticed of late, it doesn't even matter what day of the week it is.  It seems football is now being played every single day.  Yeah, I kind of don't like that.  It's amazing because I saw like...  They got Monday.  They got the Thursday.  Thursday.  We're gonna move into Saturday soon.  And then, isn't there occasionally even like a Tuesday game?  I don't know.  Maybe, I don't know.  It seems odd that there's a lot more football on. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, they're trying to squeeze it and trying to spread it out a little bit more.  Yeah.  Because, you know, people are following it closer because they have their teams.  Their fantasy football teams.  Their fantasy football teams.  The Jets looked horrendous.  They didn't deserve to beat the Dolphins.  I do know they won though, yes.  Then the Dolphins coach at the end of the game tries to freeze Folk, the Jets kicker there.  Well, he calls a timeout just...  He calls a timeout technically before the ball was snapped. 
[00:08:00]  Well, here's the play.  Oh.  Well, or maybe this isn't the play.  Anyway.  Oh, Jesus, Sam.  He calls a timeout and officially it was a timeout, but the play still went.  You know one of those?  The timing issue?  Yeah.  And it turns out he probably shouldn't have called a timeout because they blocked the  field goal that won the game.  Oh.  Thus then, Folk had another shot at it and he...  And he hit it.  I couldn't see it.  I was just watching it up on the screen.  But I couldn't see the block because of all the shit on the screen.  Right.  So the lazy networks are showing the play. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  And they're showing the kick and you see something happen after the action comes above  all the words.  Wow.  The Fox Business now has five lines of shit at the bottom of their screen.  Most networks have about two.  Two lines.  Five lines of shit.  Some have...  Fox News, I see, has three lines of shit.  Yeah.  Fox Business is taking it to the next level.  They now have five lines of shit.  And I...  That's more than a quarter of the screen, by the way.  Yeah.  I would call it...  Yes. 
[00:09:00]  What?  Two...  A little more.  30% of the screen, maybe?  A little less than 30%.  Yeah.  That would be because that's what I was trying to figure out.  A third-er.  So, you know, so the Jets end up winning, but no one in Jet Nation is happy.  Oh, huh?  No, we might have lost Revis for the season, too.  He has a knee injury.  But at least they got that win.  Do you know who Revis is?  Huh?  What's that?  He's probably one of the greatest fucking players in the league right now, and he goes  out with a knee injury. 
[00:09:30]  One of the best defensive players in the league.  Oh, yeah?  That's gonna be some trouble.  Darrell Revis.  Yeah, he's one of our fucking stars.  Oh, boy.  He's one of our stars.  He's a big star.  But Sanchez looks like shit.  Yeah.  At one point, he throws a fucking pass off Tebow's helmet.  There's your quarterback experiment.  On purpose?  Well, now everyone's...  Now everyone...  What is it?  A gif?  What do they call those fucking things?  It's a meme.  A meme?  Is it a meme or a gif?  You wanna see this thing? 
[00:10:00]  You got that play, too?  There's Sam.  You don't know.  I don't know.  At this point, Sam's just like, I don't know.  Oh, you don't know football, either.  He's a viral video star now, Sam.  No one cares about football.  He doesn't have too much Applebee's.  He doesn't have...  No one cares about football.  Commercial's in front of your video now, so...  Come on.  Where's this fucking thing?  Where's Travis?  We were watching it all morning.  Hey, Revis.  We were just watching it two minutes ago on that very computer there, Sam.  He clicked out of it.  Oh, boy.  I don't have the faintest idea on how to find it again.  Well, that's not it.  That's just a play.  Is this it? 
[00:10:30]  What do you want?  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  With or without Revis jets are bad.  There's Revis going down.  Buckles, he did not return.  Where is it there, Travis?  Oh, wow.  They put his head right...  I was talking to the sex man.  What are you looking for?  The stupid play with the Sanchez and the Tebow off the helmet.  Oh, just the gif?  Is it a gif or a meme?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, Deadspin does this thing now where they'll recap each game in a gif or two or three.  Oh, really?  Oh, man.  Who's this asshole running on the field with just shorts on?  That's the Baltimore Batman.  What?  Oh, God.  Well, now he's a guy because he did this at the Orioles' home opener. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  He's the Baltimore Batman?  Well, yeah, because he wears a cape.  And as a Baltimore fan, you seem very excited about this.  Yeah, he's great.  Why is he great?  He's an idiot.  Because anyone who runs on the field is great.  And anyone who does it with a cape on is even better.  I love the guys that run on the field because they realize right away there's no escape.  They're like, oh, fuck, where am I running to?  And then they look stupid.  Because he's done it.  He did it before.  He did it in April.  And now he did it last night during the Ravens' passing game.  You're going to run into the tunnel to the applause of the crowd and hats on the back from security. 
[00:11:30]  I love the guys that run all the way into the outfield in a baseball game and then realize, oh, fuck, I can't climb this wall.  I have nowhere to go.  And then they turn around and they do the back and forth hoping to trick somebody.  But even if you trick one of those idiots, then most of the time you can because they're out of shape, then where do you go?  Has anyone ever got it in a way?  Tanner Boyle.  Tanner Boyle.  Right.  He got away.  I love how Florentine feels about that.  That was because the Dolphins are his team.  Ah.  It's brutal. 
[00:12:00]  Well, the Dolphins are.  You know what?  I can't say the Jets are a bad team because they're my team.  But they are.  And the Dolphins aren't much better.  The Dolphins are bad.  Fuck it.  The Jets are one of those teams that looked awesome in the first week.  And now they just kind of.  Yeah.  They can't wait to play the Bills again.  They're looking at that schedule.  When do we play the Bills again?  Because we know we could play them pretty good.  Hey, they got the win.  That's it.  Yeah.  And you know what?  They're at the top of the Ipsi East.  So I don't know what that.  I mean, they're two and one. 
[00:12:30]  We can't find that play.  Oh, you want them?  I was going to play.  Oh, now we're going to do the Baltimore Batman.  They're very excited about the Baltimore Batman.  During a timeout, obviously.  Yeah.  He's at the 10.  He's at the 20.  He took out.  He's just in a dumb cape.  He looks like a complete idiot.  Yeah, what's he doing?  A little dance?  Wow, he's just doing like a little dance in the middle of the field.  At least they showed him.  He's good.  Or is this another camera?  This is somebody filmed it at the stadium.  Yeah, the network's not wanting to show this stuff.  I think you got to show it. 
[00:13:00]  People like seeing this shit in a weird way.  Now he's on the 50-yard line.  Now he's like, all right, now what?  Where's security at this point?  They're letting him run around out there.  He's at the 50.  He's tipping his hat to the...  Oh, here we go.  There's a cop right there.  They're just moving it slowly.  He's running in circles.  Oh, he's trying to get through it.  Oh, he got through the hole!  See, I think he just enjoys the chase because he's not...  He doesn't do anything really exciting until they come around.  He's on the 20. 
[00:13:30]  Wow, he's really making a fool of himself.  He is an ass.  He's on Deadspin for the people out there?  Yes.  All right.  Oh, shit, there's a lot of people there.  Oh, they tackle him.  The fault of what Batman is down.  Why are they roughing him up?  He gives a fuck.  We gotta rough him up a little.  So the next guy doesn't do it?  Yeah, and it's fun for them, you know?  True.  What fun is it for the cops and security unless you could, like, throw a punch or two?  And he's known as Baltimore Batman?  Oh, yeah, he's the Baltimore Batman.  He strikes again. 
[00:14:00]  What an asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That would be great if they shot him.  Right in front of everybody.  That would be wrong.  Shoot him.  If he's running around, he just sort of...  And he just collapses.  The NFL just says, look, the next guy will do it.  We're fucking shooting him in front of a national audience.  Here.  Make an example of him.  There you go.  Sanchez off Tebow's fucking helmet.  That's all you need to know about the Jets and their dumb quarterbacks.  That's great.  Boink.  Boink. 
[00:14:30]  Boink.  Boink.  And what happened with the Pats yesterday?  They lost.  I didn't watch that game, but Belichick was fucking pissed.  Belichick's gonna...  He'll probably get fined because he touched a ref.  Belichick was running off the field going,  Hey! Hey!  And grabs a ref and tries to pull him back because he wanted to talk to him.  Yeah, you can't grab a ref.  Oh, boy.  There was a game-winning field goal in that game, and...  Yeah, I think frustration...  Come on, Travis.  What do you think?  You think that went in?  What?  The field goal? 
[00:15:00]  Be honest.  Of course it went in.  Be honest.  The Ravens won 30-130.  Is that two losses in a row for him?  Yeah.  Yes, it's the first time the Pats have been under 500 since week one of 2003.  They're one and two, and they've lost two tough games in a row.  Wow.  Show these guys the field goal.  I mean, we got the...  Find the field goal.  We got the replacement refs.  You know the Jets game was like, I think, seven and a half hours yesterday?  Oh, Jesus.  It bled into the Emmys.  I think frustration...  What is going on with these fucking games?  Why are they so long?  Huh?  Hmm?  Why are they going so long? 
[00:15:30]  I don't know, but I did notice that that Ravens-Pats game was really going like a little late.  I know it didn't start until...  Well, the Patriots had 24 penalties.  That seems to be a lot of penalties.  Wow.  These replacement refs are just slowing the fuck down.  Yeah.  You know, slowing the fuck down.  These games, whatever.  Slowing the games the fuck down.  That's how you say that.  Yes.  Here's the plot.  Well, that's from a horrible angle.  Somebody's fucking...  Why can't we just get the clip?  Well, it's the first one I clicked on. 
[00:16:00]  Fair enough.  Come on, Travis.  You can't see from that angle.  Exciting, though.  It was right on the tippy-tippy right corner.  Ah.  To me, I'm not a Pats fan.  To me, it looks like that field goal might have missed.  It went in.  The replacement refs don't get any calls.  Could you make that B?  I can make it.  Thank you, buddy.  This might be it.  This isn't it.  Correct.  That snap.  Wow. 
[00:16:30]  So the Pats are up 30-28.  Look at that.  Watch Belichick lose his fucking mind.  Yep.  30-28 with two seconds on the clock?  This is it.  Wow.  That's fucked up.  And it's a chip shot.  It's only 27 yards.  You can still take your time out.  Now it's all or nothing.  Oh, boy.  Comes down to this.  Mmm.  Sure.  Belichick, so Jesus.  Now watch this.  A little chip shot.  What's that?  Right?  Yeah, that is.  That's close.  Time out.  Jesus! 
[00:17:00]  Hey, what happened?  Oh, see, that one went in.  That one went.  That was easy.  Is that like the thing to do now?  You just fuck with the kicker?  They've always done that.  They've always done that.  It's a kicker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have they always done that?  I think it's a complete waste of time, because that's all those guys do.  They don't give a fuck.  It's like, here it is.  Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.  All right.  He sets up again. 
[00:17:30]  It does work at times, though.  Yeah.  Fair enough.  It's not like these timeouts roll over into the next game.  You might as well do it.  Justin Tucker for the win.  Whoa!  Right in there.  You know what?  The refs are right under the fucking...  That's hard to see.  But they're right underneath the goal.  Watch Belichick.  Hey!  Came very close.  Came right next to the...  Under the poles.  They can see it.  The upright...  I don't know.  That was really close.  Really close.  Really fucking close. 
[00:18:00]  The uprights extend through the heavens.  So if you kick it over the top of the...  That's good.  I don't know, man.  That looks good.  And you know what?  Look at where the refs are.  They're under those poles.  They look up and they see exactly where that ball is.  Doesn't get closer, but it was good.  It was good.  Nobody had a better view...  Wow.  That looked good.  Yes.  The official.  Straight on the upright.  That looks good.  I don't know.  I think that would have boinged off the fucking upright if the upright was extended.  I think it would have boinged in though.  And there's no angle from the side.  They should have an angle from the side. 
[00:18:30]  They should have an angle from the top, the bottom.  Come on.  It's 2012.  I don't know if they showed it, but I mean, they have cameras that...  Where's the Belichick where he runs after the refs?  Oh, right.  Look, he's angry right there.  He's like, what?  I had to look at Tom Brady.  Oh, no.  Sorry.  Well, Brady's reaction...  Brady's reaction proves that he thought it was good.  Very tough, but that looks good.  That looks good.  It does look... 
[00:19:00]  It looks more in than not.  Oh, here's Belichick.  Hey!  Hey!  You're gonna get fined.  It's a few bucks.  Yeah.  He don't give a fuck.  He'll pay the few bucks, right?  Yeah.  He is pissed.  Might as well play the other clip while we're doing...  Now, what's the other clip there, Travis?  Lost.  The other clip is Ravens fans loudly chanting bullshit after yet another penalty.  Oh.  Yeah.  You want the TV feed or the isolated feed?  Well, I mean, do the TV feed, but the only reason I put the isolated feed on there is  so that you can hear how loud it actually was. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  And just another shitty call.  Yeah.  John Harbaugh was trying to call a timeout, but you can't really run out onto the field  anymore as a head coach.  Why?  Because the NFL is like, you know, clamping down on that because they think that these  coaches and players are intimidating these replacement refs.  Oh, wow.  So he's trying to yell at the...  Yeah, but the reason why these guys run on the field is because they're trying to get  the attention of the refs.  Yeah, so he's sitting there yelling at the ref to call a timeout, and I guess one of the  refs thought he was, you know...  If there's not a ref around and you need to call a timeout immediately, you're going to 
[00:20:00]  run on the field to try to get the guy's attention.  Yeah, sure.  So he ended up getting unsportsmanlike conduct.  He got a lot of that.  And so then the Ravens fans were not happy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're trying to behave ourselves.  We've got to tell you.  Unsportsmanlike conduct.  Defense on the bench.  One bench.  Fifteen yards and we're at the end of the yard.  John Harbaugh is saying, I was trying to call a timeout and get your attention.  Let's see if they acknowledge that they're all yelling bullshit.  The NFL cracked down on coaches coming out on the field this week and trying to intimidate 
[00:20:30]  these refs.  You know Harbaugh was still worked up over that last call.  Comes out there, who knows what he was doing.  He's claiming he was trying to call a timeout.  The official wasn't buying it.  He's begging the official to come over and talk to him and instead he got a flag.  He's saying, I'm trying to call a timeout.  This is the loudest manure chant I've ever heard.  At least he acknowledged it for Al Michaels.  If they had called a hold on Ladarius Webb, I would have bought into that. 
[00:21:00]  What a great bullshit chant.  It was very good.  Al Michaels is a rare exception.  He'll acknowledge shit that's obvious going on around him.  Yeah.  And here's it isolated, you know, because through the booth, they got those different microphones  and stuff so it can block it out a little bit.  There's the booze. 
[00:21:30]  Who's making it easy with the drum to get everyone on cue?  Yeah, that's usually for, you know, defense.  Right.  It's the bullshit drum.  Nice.  Now it's the bullshit drum.  Yeah.  So now they're going to fucking, they're going to get rid of the bullshit drum.  Watch.  Watch.  Not allowed.  By Tuesday, Wednesday.  Look, we can't have the bullshit drum anymore. 
[00:22:00]  Bullshit!  Bullshit!  Bullshit!  Bullshit!  Bullshit!  Bullshit!  Bullshit!  That's great.  Bullshit!  Bullshit!  Bullshit!  They're all proud of themselves.  They're like, yeah, that's great.  Why are the replacement refs?  Why are the replacement refs?  What is the exact story?  Because the regular referees in the NFL are in a contract dispute. 
[00:22:30]  Contract dispute.  Refs want a little more money.  NFL doesn't want to give them a little more money.  So the problem is these games are going long, man.  Yeah, I'm starting to notice.  They are going long.  They're pushing about five hours on average, I think.  That's crazy.  For a football game, that's low.  There were a lot of overtime games yesterday.  Remember I asked if a fan ever escaped?  Hold on, pause that.  I just checked my Twitter and a shitload of people just tweeted the exact same video.  I guess this guy actually escaped when he ran on the field. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, yeah?  So I want to just take a look.  Must be good if it was tweeted a lot, hopefully.  So foul ball.  I know how he's going to get away.  He's running for freedom.  Oh, okay.  He could get over that wall.  He heads...  Over the center field wall.  Wow.  Well, they got that stupid grassy knoll up there. 
[00:23:30]  It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a baseball game.  Wait, he got away from that guy, too!  Put this on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  Now he's up on the...  Now that guy is pissed because he thought he had him.  Holy shit, look at this guy go.  What's in there?  I don't know.  Boxes, I think you said boxes.  Oh, the places they're mine.  One got away.  All right.  Worldstar Hip Hop!  Worldstar Hip Hop! 
[00:24:00]  No, obviously it's not.  They don't show behind the thing, though, when a guy is fucking clubbing him upstairs.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it depends what that area is.  Is that like the concourse?  Could be.  If that's the concourse, then you can blend in nice.  Yeah.  It'd be funny if it's just a facade and he just fell.  Oh, my God.  Fell to his death, yes.  Why is there that grassy lump in it?  I don't know.  It's so dumb.  What stadium is that?  That's in Houston.  Yeah, Houston has decided to make a little mound in center field.  It goes right up against the wall.  It's an actual hill.  That player stepped on it wrong and fucking... 
[00:24:30]  I'm sure.  Yeah, absolutely.  Players have definitely gotten injured on that.  It's fucking retarded.  Because every park's trying to have their little special little thing.  You gotta have a picnic area or a pool.  Get rid of it.  Football or anything except baseball.  So the guy knew, all right, all I have to do is get to that fucking hill.  He had a good plan.  He ran, jumped over the wall, and then he's in the stands, and the guy thinks he has him.  And then he jumps and grabs onto this other grass area.  A lot of grass areas.  And then he climbed up that grass area where there's no fucking fans or security around,  and then jumps over that other wall.  I don't know what... 
[00:25:00]  I think that other wall goes to the concourse, probably.  It's very funny.  I've never seen that.  All right, there you go.  So I guess one did escape.  When they designed this, they didn't think, like, that grassy part, you could jump up there  and get up into the concourse area or whatever the fuck that is.  But they figured, you know, for the most part, no one's gonna do it.  You gotta figure someone's gonna do anything that you don't expect when you're dealing with  a lot of the public in one place.  Expect the unexpected, right?  Exactly.  Correctamundo.  That's it for football.  Any other highlights from yesterday? 
[00:25:30]  No.  How did Peyton Manning do?  He lost.  He lost?  Yeah.  What are they now?  One and two.  They are, right?  Yeah.  Wowie Kazowie.  Wow.  Houston's very good, though.  That Belichick clip is everywhere today.  Hey!  Hey!  I want to talk to you!  Laying his hands on the fucking rat.  He's an angry man.  Oh, boy.  He's a hothead.  Yeah.  Oh, they were talking about Rory, Rory, Rory, Rory, and then Rory did not win. 
[00:26:00]  Schnedeker won.  Oh.  But it's a 10 million fucking bonus.  Go for him.  That's a nice week's work, right?  It certainly is.  Ho-ho.  I want to see the video of Lindsay Lohan backing into the guy.  I haven't seen the video yet.  You haven't seen that one?  Nothing happened.  It's the guy being a scumbag, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  In this case, we were all hoping that it's another Lindsay Lohan thing, but she's right  on this one.  You had to know.  The guy, she just missed the guy, and the guy decided to go with it. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  I'll say that Lindsay Lohan ran over.  You had to know.  Ran him over.  So now she's pissed and going to sue the guy.  I hope she does if he's fucking lying.  She's a beer flooding is expected.  Oh, another commercial.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  The least on that, she's suing.  And they've determined that the guy never got hit.  It was close, though.  She's not even suing because he said he got hit.  She's suing because he said she was drunk, and she said she's tired of that.  Oh, sorry that you're tired of that.  Not that time.  Yeah, not that time.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And who knows for sure.  Can you make it bigger, Sam?  Yeah, how about full screen there, Sam? 
[00:27:00]  And as she does, a person passes in front of the vehicle.  What you can't really tell is if that person was hit.  Which guy?  Well, that person is later seen walking after the car as it moves down the driveway.  Lohan was arrested for leaving the scene of an accident.  Which guy?  That guy?  I didn't even see.  Surveillance tape of the Lindsay Lohan accident is out, but it doesn't exactly clear up just what happened.  Nice face.  You can see the car, driven by Lohan, turning into a driveway. 
[00:27:30]  And as she does, a person passes in front of the vehicle.  The guy in the white shirt?  What you can't really tell is if that person was hit.  Not even close.  No.  If it's that guy.  Stop.  That guy with the hat.  As it moves down the driveway, Lohan was arrested for leaving the scene of an accident.  Well, they all determined that the guy did not get hit.  And Lohan's suing because she's sick of everyone saying she's a drunk pig.  If they didn't have to blur out everyone's fucking face on a surveillance tape.  But she is a drunk pig.  We all know that. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  Maybe she wasn't a drunk pig that night.  She's quite a slob.  She's going to sue you, too.  She's a slob.  Too suing.  I could say slob.  It doesn't really mean anything.  Alex.  No, she is a slob.  What's up?  What's up, Alex?  Well, well, well.  Hey.  Hey, listen.  There was a bunch of guys out in the outfield.  They blew up a beach ball on a gas duct tape, a fishing string to it, threw it out there  and waited for one of those guys that sits in the corner.  And the guy's running, like, all cool, like he finally got something to do. 
[00:28:30]  When he got close to the ball, he bent out and picked it up and they yanked it.  And the guy just kind of ran back to the dugout, like, all disappointed.  You know what I mean?  I see this beach ball on a string, I think it's called, something like that, at a baseball  game.  That's pretty funny, too.  That is a good one.  Look, it's baseball games.  Half the time, except for these stupid purists, it's boring when you go to a game.  You end up talking to, hopefully it brings someone cool that you can talk to for most of the  innings.  But everyone will, like, the, what is it, funny already?  This talent's going to be funny. 
[00:29:00]  All right, hold on.  Now, this guy, I love.  There's a string on there.  It's like the old Harlem Globetrotters routine.  All right, so you've got four guys with no shirts on.  There you go.  Beach ball on the outfield.  Oh, you got it.  Look at the deep.  It's just sitting there.  They're waiting for someone to go out there to pick it up.  I'm going to get it on the way back.  He thinks.  Oh, my God.  Didn't even look at it.  He didn't look at it.  Now, that's a veteran grounds crew gun. 
[00:29:30]  I guess, what?  They allow that to happen?  Why don't they throw that guy out?  They probably did.  He's disrupting the play.  I bet they did throw him out.  Is there more?  What a great idea.  That is a good idea.  That's a fun idea.  Al Michaels says later there's no seven-second delay.  You know what?  But as a society, especially people that watch sports,  I think we can handle a bullshit chant at this point.  Oh, stop.  Of course we can.  Thank you, Alex.  All right, guys.  Have a good morning.  It's a family game.  Hey, what did the Emmys do for clockwork? 
[00:30:00]  Speaking of Alex, I heard that they mentioned a clockwork orange in the beginning.  They did a little kind of skit there, right?  Did they?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, they did a little skit.  Oh.  Was it fun?  It was all right.  Jimmy Kimmel was all right.  He was a good host.  Anyone watch the Emmys?  No.  No.  I saw a minute of it at the Cellar.  I saw Louie and Amy Poehler go up together.  We got that.  But no, I did not see any of it.  I didn't even see the Patrice tribute. 
[00:30:30]  I just heard about it.  Louie, man, obviously we're all so happy you won an Emmy for your show.  And, man, he was touched.  Because, you know, Louie goes through life as that guy.  But he almost looked like he was tearing up.  Yeah.  When he was on stage accepting his Emmy.  Yeah.  It was cool.  It was really cool to see.  How were his knees?  They got to that point.  I'm a senior to our left Dayton Ohio with two very bad knees. 
[00:31:00]  And a dream to become a major league baseball player.  It makes me laugh every time.  Every time.  I wonder what happened.  This thing's a visual, man.  Watch the Emmys opening skit.  Jimmy Kimmel cries, gets punched.  I just wonder what it was because I got a tweet about it.  Four minutes. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Louie tweeted just 20 minutes ago the Portuguese feed of him winning an enemy.  Yeah.  So that might be funny to watch.  What do you mean?  Like, they probably dub it over.  They dub it over.  Oh, really?  In Portuguese.  Oh, let's take a look at that.  We got Louie winning his Emmy right here.  This damn show is proud of fucking Louie C.K.  But who wants to hear Louie say it, though?  I'm tired of his voice.  I want to hear a Portuguese man say what Louie's supposed to say.  You got it right there?  Do you think he matches Louie's, like, impression? 
[00:32:00]  No.  All right, let's see that.  Louie de Chanel.  A Zoe de Chanel, que está no seriado do New Gay, é a primeira vez que ela é indicada,  né, para o papel de melhor atriz de comédia.  Louie C.K.  O Emmy vai para Louie C.K.  Olha aqui, interessante.  Louie C.K.  Louie C.K., ele já foi indicado várias vezes para o Emmy, mas não tinha ganhado nada.  Principalmente na questão de melhor ator em comédia, né, e óbvio, né, que isso significa 
[00:32:30]  que a academia está dando um prêmio para ele, mas também pode não dar para melhor ator  de comédia.  Muito obrigado.  Muito obrigado.  Bom, eu ganhei um Emmy agora, né?  E agora, eu quero agradecer o Long Grain Gramps por me fazer participar desse programa.  Ele é um grande amigo.  E ele faz tudo por mim. 
[00:33:00]  É o meu produtor e David Beck, o meu gerente amigo.  Eu tenho que agradecer as pessoas.  Eu quero agradecer a Pamela, que me ajudou muito nesse programa.  Programa, meus filhos, Mary e Kitty, o seu pai ganhou um Emmy.  Muito obrigado.  Muito obrigado.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah, he got a little slightly choked up there, which was cool to see. 
[00:33:30]  Good for Louie, man.  Yeah, good for him.  Oh, Louie.  And he won Best Writing for Comedy Musical Special as well, right?  That was for stand-up, yeah.  So he won two fucking Emmys.  They put stand-up in a weird category, but you're competing with musicals and all this  other weird stuff.  It's not just having a stand-up, but why not just a stand-up special?  Yeah, just make another Emmy.  Who gives a fuck?  There's enough stand-up specials to qualify that.  You can't be in the same category as musicals if you're in stand-up.  They're making a big deal out of that because that was his Beacon Theater show, which he  sold for five bucks online.  Right. 
[00:34:00]  And then, you know, FX put it, you know, on their network.  But now they're making a big deal saying, look, he did all of this by himself and he  won an Emmy for it, you know?  There was no network behind that.  So great.  Louis really is, he's one guy who deserves every bit of attention because he is fucking  removing power from the networks.  I mean, FX gave him the ability to do what he does and that's why he thanked that guy.  But the fucking bottom, by doing a stand-up special and putting it online, no one can tell  you what to do.  It's like he's fucking changing the business. 
[00:34:30]  And he's doing the same with FX.  He doesn't even have to show these guys, you know, his shows ahead of time.  He's like, don't worry about it, I'll fucking deliver your shows, but you're not going to  be involved in the creative process.  I remember him talking about that right here on the show.  What else from the Emmys?  I got a whole disc of Emmy shit.  Ricky Gervais' exchange with Louis was pretty funny.  Track three or four?  Both.  I mean, track four is a follow-up.  Both.  Oh, my God.  I understand.  It's difficult.  It was good, though.  It was Ricky and Louis. 
[00:35:00]  How about we do this?  We play track three, and then if none of us enjoy it, we don't even have to play track  four.  We just move on.  Did the Big Bang Theory win?  People are saying I'm obsessed with the Big Bang Theory.  Yeah, I am.  It's a shit show.  They had some great skits.  It's a shit show, and a lot of people fucking watch that dumb thing.  Yeah, I am obsessed.  All I see are the 8,000 commercials for it, and I fucking, I hate it.  Who's that nerdy fucking dude that everyone thinks is so funny?  Sam?  Jim Parsons.  Jim Parsons, they think he's hilarious.  He's horrible. 
[00:35:30]  It's such a dumb...  I didn't know that he was going to say funny at the end, but I wouldn't have.  Well, he did.  I wouldn't have had your name in the chamber.  No, he said it.  Nerdy guy was a constant.  It took Seinfeld off TBS at 7 o'clock.  Please.  What, they're now doing, it's in syndication, too, now?  Oh, it is the big syndication show.  Holy fuck balls.  And a few people try to attack me.  They're like, look, your brother said how great the show was.  My brother said how great the show was years ago.  My brother has updated his opinion on the Big Bang Theory, and he fucking hates it, too, 
[00:36:00]  now.  You're also not required to like everything your brother likes.  Fair enough.  It's not a great show.  No, it's not.  It's horrible, right?  Yeah.  It's that constant, the one-liners and the, ah, ah, the fucking fake laughs.  I can't lie.  It's unwatchable.  It's terrible.  Is it unwatchable?  It is.  I have, ah, tuned in, you know, to be honest with you, and I couldn't believe what I was  watching.  I watched sitcoms.  I couldn't believe this was one of the hottest shows in the country.  It's very not good.  Waffle.  Yeah, I watch sitcoms.  I can't watch it.  Waffle.  You watch sitcoms?  Yeah.  I like sitcoms.  I call them shit-coms. 
[00:36:30]  Why?  Come on, man.  Because they're shitty.  You watch The Modern Family?  Yeah, that's a funny show.  Is it a funny show?  Yes.  Is it a good show?  Modern Family is really good.  Yeah, I'm not going to beat it up.  I've only seen it a couple times.  I watch it every single episode.  It's good, huh?  I love it.  What show?  Modern Family.  Modern Family.  I'm a big Modern Family fan.  Oh, the guy that's not gay that won an Emmy was pretty choked up about winning his Emmy.  Oh, Eric Stonestreet.  Yeah.  And we had him in studio.  That guy's really cool.  Yes.  Good guy.  It was weird seeing all these guys that have been on our show winning Emmys. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  I was thinking that last night.  Aaron Paul won an Emmy.  He's been in here.  It was weird.  He was choked up, too.  He won, huh?  He won.  He beat Giancarlo.  Yes.  Yeah.  And they were very emotional.  Puerto Rico, check it in.  Big Bang Theory is not that bad.  You know what?  When I watch a TV show, I want a little more than it's not that bad.  It's quite bad.  It may be in Puerto Rico.  Exactly.  Maybe it translates.  Yeah.  Where were we going with this? 
[00:37:30]  Big Bang Theory.  There's a point to this madness.  That it stinks.  They did have some fun skits, though.  Oh, gosh.  During the Emmys.  I bet not.  Oh, okay.  The Ricky Gervais, Louis C.K. thing.  Oh, I know what I wanted to say.  Fucking John Cryer wins an Emmy.  Oh, my God.  Is that a face to Charlie Sheen or what?  It was a fucking joke.  I couldn't believe when they gave him the Emmy.  Even John Cryer's like, what?  What the fuck?  This isn't supposed to happen.  No, no.  He was basically saying, don't do this to me.  That was a fuck you to Charlie and the things he said. 
[00:38:00]  That's Hollywood going, you know what, Charlie?  Yeah.  This is who has the power in the end.  Look what we do now.  Because Charlie Sheen can't defend that.  He leaves the show and then John Cryer wins an Emmy.  He's also, Charlie's doing well, too.  So there's a weird thing with Hollywood.  Like, he insulted, he said some nasty anti-Semitic shit or some stuff that didn't seem too nice.  Which, again, did he mean it?  It was probably just anger in the moment.  Right.  But that riles people up out there.  If you say anti-Jewish stuff, people out there are kind of, you know, they're fed up with hearing that shit.  You think John Cryer deserved this or is this a little back room thing? 
[00:38:30]  He beat Alec Baldwin.  He beat Louie.  Yeah, those guys are way better than John Cryer.  Way better.  That's not a good show.  Two and a Half Men is not a good show.  He won for supporting actor, but this year they put him up in lead actor.  I think Louie and Alec Baldwin, of course.  They're both better than him.  Who else was up?  I forget.  Jim Parsons, I think.  Ah!  I fucking hate that guy.  He stinks.  They love him in Hollywood, though.  They do.  Oh, my God.  You don't like his cameo in the Muppet movie? 
[00:39:00]  Ah, it was all right.  It wasn't bad.  I've seen the movie a million fucking times.  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't like...  John Cryer.  He beat out Larry David in Curb.  Don Cheadle in House of Lives.  Don Cheadle in House of Lives.  What?  Louis C.K. in Louie and Alec Baldwin.  He beat out Don Cheadle?  Stop it.  Every one of them deserves to remember.  John Cryer?  I swear to God, if you put ten people in a room from all walks of life and said, okay,  who has the least chance of winning this Emmy, every single person would write John Cryer. 
[00:39:30]  John Cryer would be tops on the list.  Cheadle probably is the best pure actor out of all of them.  I don't know how good that show is.  Of course he is.  I've seen a few episodes.  He's amazing in it.  Yeah, he's really good.  According to Sam, it's called the House of Lives.  Lies.  You didn't say lies.  You said lives.  He threw a V in there like you always do.  Oh.  That's my thing.  What happened?  Throw Vs in.  I love Louie.  You guys want to watch?  Everyone's going.  You got to play the Big Bang Theory without the laugh track.  Can we do it again?  Again?  Please.  Oh, please.  Because Emmys are hot right now. 
[00:40:00]  I love it.  Maybe people haven't heard this thing.  But it does show you what fucking cadence-oriented things these shows are.  And there's no laughs.  It also shows you all the comedy you're missing by laughing so much.  Oh, boy.  Is that what it is?  Great point, Travis.  I didn't think of it that either.  Tinkerbell just needs to get her some.  Some what?  Oh, yes.  Some sexual intercourse.  I'll take the bullet.  Excuse me.  This whole idea is insane.  Enough debate.  I'm going to take action. 
[00:40:30]  Excuse me.  Are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?  No.  Would you like to be?  Sure.  Why not?  Sheldon?  Nip-ip-ip-ip.  Can I have your phone number?  Uh, yeah.  Right sit on his hand.  I guess that would have been a huge laugh, right?  There.  Problem solved.  Dumbass. 
[00:41:00]  Funny show.  Yeah, really, really funny show.  Oh, my God.  But I mean, that's only one scene, but it shows you the unrealistic.  Wow.  It also shows that they're horrible actors because how they put that together with the edits.  Yeah.  They're like, okay, your line is boom.  Okay, stop the camera over here.  Now your line is boom.  You don't notice that because the laugh track just blends all that shit in.  That's so bad.  Are you involved in a sexual relationship?  Like, who talks like that?  No one.  Another reason Louie gets so much respect is because the dialogue is believable. 
[00:41:30]  It's just people talking.  Right.  Well, see, but Jim Parsons is a big geek, so he would say that.  Is he?  I get it.  Don't mention his name.  And he might be a decent actor or a great actor, but he did have a fun skit last night.  Shut up.  What was his fun skit?  I need to know now.  When they put, well, you know when they bring the people who count the votes out on stage?  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  The accountants.  He's a geek.  That's his favorite part.  Oh, that's his favorite part.  They're mathematicians.  Oh, I saw that.  It's fine.  I didn't know what I was watching.  What?  He was on the set of Big Bang Theory making believe he's watching the Emmys, and then those 
[00:42:00]  guys come out, and he's talking all excited about who they are.  Like, he really knows those people.  It's another thing I hate about fucking TBS.  All their promos are on the couch with the Big Bang Theory people for all their other shows.  Because it's their big hit.  Oh, it's terrible.  Was that a TBS show originally?  No.  Oh, okay.  But they got them in syndication, so they're going to fucking ride that.  It's a CBS show.  Because, you know, I am, you know, there's people fucking defending the show right now.  I don't get it.  A lot of people like it. 
[00:42:30]  Shut up.  It's a big show.  CBS has that.  They have, what is it, the two girls, the work?  What is it?  Two girls, one cup.  Two broke girls.  They have some big shows, man.  I met your mother.  That's a big one, too, right?  It's very big.  That's not that bad.  NBC or ABC have any big shows?  What does ABC or NBC have sitcom-wise?  NBC has 30 Rock.  NBC has...  That's not a big hit, though.  I mean, it's a big hit in the industry, but it's not a big hit as far as viewers.  They have Community, which is the same thing.  Another one.  The industry seems to like it.  Just real clever shows that... 
[00:43:00]  See, that's why...  Okay.  Thank you, Jim Norton.  That's why, because I've got to explain to myself why it frustrates the fuck out of me.  Because those two shows are way the fuck better, but no one watches them.  Community should absolutely be nominated for it.  Community is hilarious, and 30 Rock is hilarious.  Parks and Recreation.  Parks is hilarious.  Parks and Recreation might be the funniest sitcom right now.  No one watches it.  Not to the same extent as Big Bang Theory, I should say.  Enough people watch where they keep it on TV.  It's all shows that have almost been canceled every year.  Right.  Is Parks and Recreation...  I know Amy's in it, and Aziz is... 
[00:43:30]  Amy's ridiculously funny in everything she does.  Parks got really funny.  Yeah.  Somewhere in season two-ish, it just started getting ridiculously funny.  That was, by the way...  Louie's done some time on that show.  That was one of the things that started this arc to fucking massive success, was he had  a six or seven episode thing on Parks and Recreation, and that was one of the things  that fucking began propelling him.  Yeah.  And it pushed the show.  I mean, that's when the show started getting funny, because he had a great run on it, and  it's been funny ever since.  I guess that's why it frustrates me. 
[00:44:00]  I mean, what are the numbers?  How many more people are watching Big Bang Theory?  A lot more.  A lot more.  Way more.  Significantly more.  You're trying to tell me that's a better show than 30 Rock?  I'll just go with 30 Rock.  Numbers don't lie.  It's probably younger people watch it, though.  I guarantee a Big Bang Theory is a younger demo.  And it's more accessible.  You're giving the American people much too much credit for thinking that they would like  a better show over a shitty show.  I know.  Because most of the people are dumb fucks.  But the problem is, shows like 30 Rock and Community and Parks, they go away, and they 
[00:44:30]  get more of these dumb Big Bang Theory type of fucking shows.  That's the problem.  No good script had been sent.  Had been sent.  Yeah, okay.  This was in May of last year.  Or this year.  So this was in May.  Big Bang Theory had 13.3 million viewers.  And on the same night, and that was the season finale, but on the same night, it was a new  episode of 30 Rock that brought in 2.95 million. 
[00:45:00]  2.9 to what?  13.  That's literally 10 million more people.  You're telling me Big Bang Theory is that much better than 30 Rock?  There's no fucking way.  10 million more funny.  Must be a much, much younger demo that just, you know, they all watch it.  It's unbelievable.  It's very stupid.  Like Anne said.  It's more accessible.  It just says a lot about America.  It is.  You're, you're, you know.  Milk toast.  Yeah, I just don't watch it.  A show about the business. 
[00:45:30]  Like, on 30 Rock's about the inner workings of the business is just not, I guess, as interesting  to the mainstream people.  You to business.  Yeah, but you don't need to, I don't know.  The jokes are there.  There's no laugh track.  There's nobody telling you when to laugh.  Yeah.  You know, like.  Yeah.  Oh, there is no laugh track.  Yeah, believe it or not, you got to figure out how to laugh on your own.  Instead of, like, laugh with the fucking crowd because you hear laughter.  So, like, oh, I guess I'm supposed to laugh now.  All those NBC sitcoms that don't do well but are actually good have no laugh tracks.  Community has none.  Right.  That's great.  30 Rock.  Right.  Parks.  Arrested Development was one of the funniest shows in the last 10 years. 
[00:46:00]  No laugh track.  It's hysterical.  Don't lie.  Got canceled.  And they're bringing it back, right?  They are bringing it back.  How many years ago was it off?  It's been too long.  Five or six years now?  I thought it was more than that.  It may be more.  I hope they could bring that back and be successful.  I know they're bringing it back.  It doesn't matter.  It's going to Netflix.  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  Is that what's happening?  It's going to the end.  Yep.  They're putting all 10 episodes up at once.  Oh, boy.  Then maybe do more.  That'll do well.  I know a lot of people are starting to look at Netflix, but it's still a little early in the game  for all that.  This will break records. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, of course.  I think Netflix hurt themselves when they did that stuff.  They tried to lift something heavy?  Yes.  They pulled their back.  Yes.  And they're now called Netflix.  Remember when they did that thing where they lost like a million subs?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That hurt them, I think.  Because they tried to change their name to their streaming service?  Yeah, yeah.  Just the TV service?  And by the way.  That's stupid.  By the way.  I'm not a huge fan of The Office. 
[00:47:00]  Not.  How can you be?  Yeah.  I don't hate it.  Well, and it's having a horrendous year, right?  It's done.  Good.  The season premiere was like the lowest rated.  Yeah.  This is the last year for The Office?  Yes.  Who's the guy?  Nobody really.  Ed Helms, you could say.  Yeah.  Because he's the boss now, but it's more of like an ensemble thing instead of like Steve  Corral for a couple years there, and then it just got like, okay, what are you doing  with this show?  Well, they turned him into like an idiot.  A retard.  Yeah.  Like he went from being just, you know, a boss that's not that smart to just this completely 
[00:47:30]  retarded person.  Well, that shows you what happens.  Like the original The Office was 12 episodes.  Oh, it was great.  Six, six, and a brilliant fucking special to wrap it all up.  I mean, it's the perfect formula.  That shows you what happens when a show goes.  It's like, it's hard to find, I guess, in fairness to them, storylines.  Right.  What do you do?  Yeah, when you have it for fucking, what's on for 10 years.  22 episodes a season on network.  Like you can't even have a little bit of freedom that they would have on BBC, I think, or HBO. 
[00:48:00]  The BBC.  Another show that's hilarious that no one watches, it's always sunny.  Yeah.  The numbers for that show are nowhere near a big bang theory.  It gets more and more popular each year.  Love it.  But it also gets a little worse every year.  I know Danny's a huge fan of that show too.  Say yes, that's me.  So here's Ricky Gervais and Louis C.K. at the Emmys.  Yes.  This is outstanding directing for a Variety special.  Variety.  Okay.  So good job this is live, because if it wasn't, this would not make the edit.  Definitely. 
[00:48:30]  A couple of these aren't, they're even working.  They did, you got an Emmy.  What are you going to do?  I'll just stay in the truck, probably.  What's happening?  Here are the nominees for directing in a Variety special.  Yeah, what was happening there?  I wasn't laughing at all.  He's about to read the nominees.  Was that a visual though?  You should have.  Why was everyone laughing at that?  You should have started the clip earlier.  I didn't want it to be like a four minute.  Yeah, right before that he said they flew me over for the big one.  And then he says directing in a Variety. 
[00:49:00]  Variety.  Oh, he got a shitty fucking award.  So you removed the setup?  So basically what we just heard was.  I wasn't laughing there, because I had no idea what he was doing.  It was funny.  You click it on.  But it would have been funny if you had the whole piece.  Of course.  We basically turned it on and we heard, they own it.  Yes.  Who owns what?  Right.  You don't make the setup out, Sam.  You put Velcro on the ceiling.  Yeah.  You know.  Sam, will you admit that you finally blew it?  No.  Fuck.  But you did.  When are you going to admit it?  He's a viral video star. 
[00:49:30]  Stop.  Well, we'll get into that next time.  Exactly.  I wish he was a viral video star.  Yes.  Video of him with the virus.  I'm just thinking of other fucking ones I've seen.  You know, beheading the...  I wish he was in the Eugene Armstrong clip.  That big...  Oh, boy, would they love to cut your head off.  Oh, they'd love to grab a big head of hair there and put his head on his own back.  How dare you.  Oh, terrible.  Not even a clip package.  I've just got to read them.  This is disrespectful. 
[00:50:00]  Don Misha, 84th Annual Academy Awards.  You can't give an Emmy to awards shows.  Why?  That's so stupid.  Fucking boring is that?  And how do you know it's a good fucking awards show?  Those are hard to direct.  Someone has to sit there and go, wow, you know, that was fucking...  Wow, that was really good.  I didn't think you could pull it off.  I gotta make a note, because the Emmys are coming up, and I think this fucking Oscar show should win one.  How terrible.  Somebody's got to make the call to move to camera three. 
[00:50:30]  It's so dumb.  What makes a good one?  There's never been one.  Usually the host.  I don't know.  If you don't have a good host, then it's a shitty show, no matter what you do behind the  scenes with the camera changes and all that.  What if the microphones aren't on?  Ugh.  Lewis J. Horowitz.  The 54th Annual Grammy Awards.  And now the Grammys.  The Grammys win an Emmy.  Let's, you know...  It's still this award show self-congratulation. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, yeah, that's stupid.  This is what I know about the two shows.  One shows movie clips, and the other has, like, a lot of musical performances.  Besides that, I wouldn't know if one's a good show or not.  Another one.  Louis C.K.  This is ridiculous.  Louis C.K.  Live at the Beacon Theatre.  If he wins this, he's a better comedian than me.  If not...  We're C. 
[00:51:30]  We're C.  I don't know.  Alan Skard, New York City Ballet.  George Balanchine's The Nutcracker.  But that's what stand-up has to compete with.  They don't give stand-up its own category.  You gotta compete with the fucking Oscars?  You have to compete with the Oscars, the Grammys, and a ballet...  And a ballet show?  Stupid.  Yeah, but it just should be a comedy award, and then there's silliness.  There's dumb shit.  And they should call it, okay, we're gonna give an Emmy away to some dumb shit now. 
[00:52:00]  A ballet?  What?  The ballet.  And Glenn Weiss, 65th Annual Tony Awards.  Of course.  Why wouldn't it be?  Does that ever change year to year?  In this category?  It's usually the same stuff.  It's usually the same shit, right?  There's like a stand-up thing.  And then they throw in the real, you know, guy.  This year, Louis C.K.  And the Emmy goes to... 
[00:52:30]  What?  Who's that?  Somebody yelled something.  I'm an atheist, and that worried me.  Okay.  I hope it's Louis now, because he's amazing.  Sorry to the other ones, but I feel bad.  Let's see.  And the Emmy goes to Glenn Weiss. 
[00:53:00]  What's that?  Who is directing what they're watching right now.  He directed the Tonys.  And now he's directing the...  The Emmys.  The Emmys.  The Emmys.  Self-congratulating.  Wait, Louis lost that?  He did not win.  That was for directing.  But that's hard for stand-up to compete with in a directing thing, because you're only showing  you on stage.  Yes.  How do you compete with that when the guy's got the award show and every star in fucking  Hollywood, or every star from Broadway...  Yada-da-da-da-da, yada-da-da-da.  Oh, and in memoriam, and it's fucking everyone from last year. 
[00:53:30]  Yada-da-da-da-da-da.  Yada-da-da-da-da.  They gave him...  They gave him more time to accept his award than they gave the writers of Homeland.  Oh, yeah.  Way more.  Way more time.  That's more interesting, right?  Boy, did they just let him talk, because he was the director of the show.  No, get the fuck off the stage music.  Yeah, what makes an award show good?  What's fun?  You know, he gets to play himself off, because he's the director.  Hey.  Oh, boy.  And then Louis went up there with Ricky or something?  No, Ricky then brought up... 
[00:54:00]  You know, he said that if Louis wins, he'll be a better comedian than me.  Yes.  Louis did not win, so then he followed up.  Well done.  And well done to everyone in that category, especially Louis, the second best comedian in  the world.  He's been looking around at me all night, every time he won, so there you go.  Here are the nominees for Variety Music or Comedy Special. 
[00:54:30]  Okay.  Play better on TV.  And Sam forgot the setup for the whole thing.  I think that kind of ruined the whole thing.  It's our friend Louis, and Ricky Gervais is talking about him, and that's the relevance  of the clip.  We do love that part of it, but you should have given us the whole setup so we could have  laughed a lot.  Started on a sour note, right?  We're past it.  Yeah, he did start off on a sour note.  All right.  On a sour note.  Anything else from the Emmys that is worth mentioning before we take a break?  Seth MacFarlane, dead idiot, not knowing where his microphone was. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  I saw that.  What a buffoon.  He's crazy.  Well, sticking with the television theme, there was a, something on, I think it's the site  is masterofsopranos.wordpress.com.  Um, yes, a little bloggeroony.  Uh, but I gotta tell you, I read this fucking thing, it's very long, very long read, but  it's got video clips and still pictures and everything, but it completely explains the 
[00:55:30]  final episode of The Sopranos, finally.  Really?  Someone's posting a blog about that?  Look, let me tell you something, no, no, I know, but this is the only one I've ever  read that completely explains it, and it makes total sense.  Because I think I've seen this, how old is it?  I have no idea.  Because I think the guy, the, uh, who, was discounted by, what's his name?  David Chase?  Yeah, I think you have a name.  I don't know, but David Chase is quoted in this, and it just makes complete sense. 
[00:56:00]  Can we go through it after the break?  That Tony, yeah, no.  That Tony what, gets killed?  Tony is dead.  I mean, it is, yes.  You read it on your own.  It makes complete sense.  It does, but I think, well, let's see it after the break, we'll make love.  Yeah, do you have all your, uh...  Yeah, I got some of them, what they call, uh, facts.  Oh, good, good, good, yeah.  It just does make complete sense.  I think they were killing them off as well, because that's how your life just ends.  It just goes fucking black.  Yeah, all of the things they did next.  You're sitting here, and next thing you know, it's just nothingness. 
[00:56:30]  It's amazing.  Really?  All right, we'll get into it next.  Cool.  And also, uh, some iPhone 5 chat.  A bunch of iPhone 5 chat on the way, too.  Oh, yes.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Show me penis!  He's one of the biggest comedy names in Middle America and south of the Mason-Dixon line. 
[00:57:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, give it up!  It's Billy the Bassman!  Where are we going?  All right, man, settle down.  Where are we going?  All right, I'll tell you where we're going to go to Funnenland.  He's back with an all-new CD, Where Are We Going?  What are the termites eat for breakfast?  Oh, what up, Billy?  Oak meal.  Where are we going?  Fat, uneducated slobs are calling it a comedic masterpiece.  Did you hear about the lookalike competition in China?  Yeah, everybody won.  Jim Crow is rolling in his grave with laughter. 
[00:57:30]  Fuck the...  Oh, hey.  I hate the fucking...  Just like you do, man.  Where are we going?  Move over, Larry the Cable Guy.  There's a new bland, predictable redneck in town.  All right, what's Mary short for?  She's got no legs.  Where are we going now?  It's Billy the Bassman and his all-new CD, Where Are We Going?  Available now at truck stops and cracker barrels everywhere.  Coming up on the next episode of The Spectacular Suicide, 
[00:58:00]  Police Commissioner Vic Dumb rills our young hero about his mishandling of the Angerman incident.  Meanwhile, a deadly new Temptress lurks in the shadows.  Goddamn suicide!  How many times have I told you?  I know, but the children!  That's enough.  You screwed up the entire operation and Angerman managed to escape.  Whoa!  He escaped? 
[00:58:30]  How'd that happen?  I'm unstoppable.  Never mind that.  It's our case now.  Stay the hell out of the way.  But, but, but...  That's enough.  Stay here.  I'm not finished with you.  I have to go take a shit.  The city needs me.  I'll show them I can stop crime.  Hey there, suicide.  Oh no, Jenny, tell ya!  How the hell did you get in here?  My beauty was too much for this police department to handle.  Now, they're all stuck in my sexy trance. 
[00:59:00]  No, you didn't!  Oh yes I did.  And now I have you all to myself now, suicide.  Stop it!  Why, suicide?  Aren't you getting turned on?  No!  I can't let this happen.  Stop it!  Get away from me!  That's right, suicide.  Stare through my horn-rimmed glasses and into my eyes. 
[00:59:30]  Oh God!  Hands!  It's getting too tight!  That's right.  No!  No!  Yes!  Come on, suicide.  Oh my God!  I'm coming!  Oh my sweet suicide.  Now, with you out of the way, this city will finally be under my control.  Mwah!  What the?  What the hell happened here?  Suicide!  Wake up!  Wake up!  It, it... 
[01:00:00]  No, this can't be happening.  It was Jenny Tilia!  She's gonna pay for this!  Stay tuned for an all new adventure of the spectacular suicide.  All right!  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah!  Yeah!  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:00:30]  What's this?  You rock.  Uh, Queens of the Stone Age.  Ah, fuck.  Really?  Your shit?  It's called Make It With You.  I kinda like these guys.  Do you like Queens of the Stone Age?  Yeah, you know.  They're, they're hit.  Nah, that's...  I mean, yeah, I'm, I'm over-representing it too.  But I, I like the stuff I hear on the radio.  You're, you're not a fan.  I, I, I met him once and he was a complete asshole.  Well, most of them are.  Yeah, it kinda ruined it for me. 
[01:01:00]  Look at Billy Joel.  I don't have a problem with Billy Joel.  I want to say Joel every time.  I know.  I almost did there too, right?  Billy Joel.  Billy Joe.  Oh, Billy Joe.  I thought you said Billy Joel.  I know.  I think I might have like got that L in there.  All right.  Fair enough.  So, fuck.  Nevermind, 21 years ago today, by the way.  Wow.  That's the, uh, the fact to make everyone feel old.  Nirvana's Nevermind is 21 years old.  Oh my God.  How the fuck?  Get the fuck.  What the fuck?  Jesus.  That means like kids going into college weren't even born yet when Nevermind came out. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Oh God.  What do you think?  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  So, what does an 18-year-old think of Nirvana these days?  This is like a classic rock band to them or something?  I mean, it's cool to like Nirvana right now.  Like, they sell Nirvana t-shirts in Forever 21.  Ugh.  And Target.  Yeah, but when I was growing up, like, the Doors were cool.  But they were a classic rock band even when I discovered them. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, I think it's probably around the same level, yeah.  That's so fucking weird, man.  Jesus.  No?  Yeah, I mean, they're totally displaced from it.  Like, it just always just existed.  It was just there.  Right.  The Beatles.  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to get into the Sopranos thing.  Anthony has finally figured it out.  How many years ago did this go off the air?  At this point, five maybe?  Are we up to about five years off the air?  Is it?  Or is it longer?  I don't even know.  Might even be longer?  2007, I think. 
[01:02:30]  Seven, so that's five.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Maybe even eight.  So, Anthony found a blog.  How did you find this blog?  And why is it so hard to find if this is something that people would like to get into?  I don't know.  My brother sent me the link.  And why would they make the blog so long that most people would tap out before they  get to the end of the whole thing?  I think because it really in depth explains its point.  And not just the last episode, but a lot of other things in the series.  Do they explain the woods?  Yeah, they kind of do explain why there's those loose ends that they say that aren't 
[01:03:00]  really loose ends.  Because that episode was more to show the relationship between Pauly and Christopher and how their  relationship was kind of fracturing during that time than it was to really find out  what happened to the Russian.  They do, in later episodes, kind of bring him up.  But he's just gone. 
[01:03:30]  He's just fucking gone.  He just got away.  He either got away or he's dead.  But the thing is, it wasn't important what happened to him.  But every other show, they make sure you know what happened to the Russian.  Yeah.  I guess that's the brilliance of the Sopranos.  You kind of do know that, you kind of assume, based on a couple of other things that happened  in later episodes, that he just got killed.  To me, that was just, that's hindsight trying to make up for writing that was lacking.  Like, the fact that they didn't, there was a couple things they did that you just were 
[01:04:00]  like, eh, as much as brilliant writers as they had, that was weak.  Like, that was a weak thing.  Didn't a money bag fall off a fucking truck in one episode?  Like, there's a few things that you're like, oh, come on.  Well, it, I don't know.  It may be a hindsight thing, but the way it's explained is, it's done very well.  And that there is a purpose to pretty much everything that was going on in the series.  And through interviews over the years, even David Chase kind of says that.  Kind of brings up the fact that, you know, it is an ongoing story. 
[01:04:30]  And some of the things that were brought up and put in the show and some of the just background  things have a meaning.  So what, uh, what can you tell us about the final episode?  Well, uh, apparently the members only jacket guy.  Right.  That comes in.  Right.  Um, walks to the bathroom.  Right.  And then at some point comes out, uh, puts a gun to the rear right side of Tony's head 
[01:05:00]  and shoots him in the fucking head.  Yeah.  We all know that.  And that's it.  Yeah.  Why'd you have to read a blog to know that?  That's it.  Yeah.  A lot of what makes sense is it, this, this blog takes it step by step, every bit of the  directing and the way the actors are moving, the way they're framed, the, the way they  look at the camera and the all important point of view and the bell.  Yeah.  The bell and Tony's point of view. 
[01:05:30]  It's the, uh, a shot that, uh, is showing Tony's point of view from Tony's eyes.  That's what he's seeing.  The bell rings.  Uh, you hear the bell ring from someone walking in the door.  Tony looks, looks up.  You see Tony's face look up.  Um, then they show Tony's point of view looking at the door and you see who walks in and this  happens throughout the entire time that Tony's sitting there waiting for his family to come 
[01:06:00]  in.  Right.  Uh, yeah.  And then, uh, Carmela comes in and, uh, his son and they're waiting for Meadow.  Um, and every time he looks up, then they do the same thing.  Bell, he looks up, then they show point of view.  The last shot is when he hears the bell and, uh, you see his face and then it goes black.  Right.  And it stays black for 10 seconds.  Right.  That's again, his point of view.  Right.  Is nothing. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  It's black.  And that's what you're.  And that's your, you're led to believe he's dead.  And that's what your death is.  You don't have a memory of your own death, obviously.  Her whole thing with parking the car.  Um, it, it seems that it was a good thing.  It would have been harder for the guy to shoot Tony if Meadow was in there because she, the  only place opened was the seat to Tony's right, which was between the bathroom and Tony.  And that's what they explained to.  So yeah, they say that Meadow might've, if she got there on time, didn't have trouble 
[01:07:00]  parking, might've been able to at least prevent it, might've given Tony a little heads up,  uh, that this was happening, uh, but she wasn't able to get in there and save him.  Why no gunshot?  Is that too obvious?  Because, and they, they, because if it's his point of view, you would absolutely hear the  gun gunshot before everything goes.  And they preface that in a lot of the earlier episodes that they say, you never hear it.  You never hear the shot that kills you.  They actually, there's a scene where, if you remember, uh, what's his name? 
[01:07:30]  Fucking, uh, from, uh, Bruce's band.  Because the bullet's going faster?  Yeah.  And just that confusion.  Yeah.  The bullet's going faster.  Uh, Syl.  Syl is sitting there with another guy that gets killed.  Um, and remember he's talking and all of a sudden he's just got blood on him and he's  like, it's slow motion.  He's like, what the fuck?  Right.  Like he doesn't even know what happened.  You don't hear a shot.  You don't hear anything.  He's just all of a sudden covered in blood. 
[01:08:00]  He looks up and the other guy's being shot and killed right in front of him.  Uh, it's always alluded to that.  They're saying that, uh, it just happens.  You don't see anything.  You're just done.  Um, it, it, it's, uh,  I think it's the most, um, insightful answer to that last episode that I've ever, ever  read.  I always thought he was killed.  I really did.  Yeah.  The, also the way they, um, the way they show the members only jacket guy. 
[01:08:30]  Right.  Uh, coming in, looking at Tony, he gives him a, it's a very purposeful look.  Right.  Uh, at Tony and he keeps his eye on him where everyone else isn't even acknowledging Tony.  And they, they go around the room showing a lot of people.  Now, is he a decoy?  Was he the guy they say killed him?  Yeah.  Or was he the guy that distracted Tony so someone else in the diner could do the thing?  I think in three previous episodes, people were killed by guys wearing members only jackets.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's, it's a very, uh, for some reason, it's a, a, a, a very, uh, purposeful thing that, 
[01:09:00]  that David Chase put in there.  And you said David Chase is in this blog from what they found interviews.  He did found interviews that he had done and said he might've slipped up and hinted too  much or something.  Yeah.  When you put it all together, he said things like, uh, it's all there.  If you look for it, it's all there.  The answers are all there.  And the way that it's spelt out here is really amazing.  Um, and, and very, very small little clues and hints that took place over either the 
[01:09:30]  entire series or the last season or that last episode where it really makes perfect sense.  So you think that David Chase wanted to end this series by killing some, you know, Tony,  but he didn't want it to be the hack.  All right, here you go.  This is what we're all expecting.  Bang.  Yeah.  That, that's even an easy way to look at it.  It's a lot more in depth as to why he did it this way instead of just having Tony get  shot.  Explain, explain.  It's through his eyes. 
[01:10:00]  The, he said the frenzy that was whipped up with people wanting to see Tony killed after  all those years of rooting for him.  Right.  Was almost a sick thought process that he had.  It's like, why would people even think that?  Like, so he gave the people exactly what Tony got through his own eyes.  You don't get to see him die, but you know, he's dead.  Right.  Just like Tony had to deal with.  Chase says that he didn't get whacked.  Where? 
[01:10:30]  It's saying right here in the, in an article in the, it says, uh, Chase says, so, so were  those onion rings, Tony's last meal.  Chase says that Tony did not get whacked.  As many fans speculated when their screens faded to black following the restaurant scene  in the Soprano.  Uh, he said he's, he would say he's Brady fans for obsessing over it.  Let me ask you this then.  Uh, Chase goes, he didn't get whacked.  Could Tony have had a heart attack?  One of those quick ones.  I don't know.  I think he's saying that where the, and it throws people off the scent like, no, Tony 
[01:11:00]  didn't get whacked.  I don't know.  Why wouldn't Tony say he didn't die?  Just throw a little fuel in the fire.  I don't know.  He says, he also says this, he says, there are no esoteric clues in there.  No Da Vinci code.  Chase states matter of factly.  I heard about the no Da Vinci code thing, but he felt the show was positive.  The way it ended on a positive note.  He said, AJ will probably be a low level movie producer, but he's not going to be a killer  like his father.  When is this interview?  When was this one?  Probably 2007. 
[01:11:30]  He said, Meadow may not become a pediatrician or even a lawyer, but she'll learn to operate  in the world in ways that Carmela never did.  It's not ideal.  It's not what the parents dreamt of, but it's better than it was, Chase says.  So that was what his explanation.  I've never even heard that interview.  Oh my God.  October 23rd of 2007.  But maybe.  Wow.  Then what the fuck were the other things he was saying?  Jesus.  But Chase might be.  But he might be one of those guys that goes, you know what?  Fuck that.  I'll just, now I'll do this interview. 
[01:12:00]  You know what I mean?  Wow.  Really just continuing to fuck with people.  Well, he was criticizing people because there was a war in London and they were obsessed  over the onion rings, over Tony's onion rings.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, people, he's like, but he said Tony was our alter ego or that's how he saw him.  And he goes, I couldn't believe people's bloodlust for this guy.  Like they wanted him dead.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They wanted him dead.  But this blog is quite fascinating.  It's great.  Now, I, yeah.  What else is in there, Ant?  Anything else?  There are also, it's very long.  There are ties to other movies and shows that, and it does get a little crazy toward the end 
[01:12:30]  of it.  I think he just gets a little carried away with himself and he's picking little things  out and making something of it.  Okay.  But, yeah, but no, I think the solution to the last episode was the part that really  got me, but boy, I never heard that interview.  Well, he wanted it to go to black all the way to the HBO whoosh, he said, but the Directors  Guild wouldn't give the waiver.  I guess they have to.  To a guy that fucking really helped your name.  Geez, these scars are...  No, it wasn't HBO.  It was the Directors Guild. 
[01:13:00]  HBO would have.  Oh, okay, okay.  The Directors Guild.  So why wouldn't they allow that?  It's a union thing.  Wow, there were so many other things that David Chase has quoted as saying over the  years, though, that doesn't jive with what he said there.  What did he say in this, then?  Well, he quotes other interviews that he said that said, yeah, it's all there, and he does  talk about these little details that meant something instead of it being a Da Vinci quote.  I don't know.  It's just odd that he's so flip-floppy with that. 
[01:13:30]  I'll have to actually read that interview, too.  Yeah, it's from the Daily News, October.  David Chase reveals the truth behind The Sopranos ending.  You don't think he was killed?  No, I never thought he was killed.  Or died of whatever?  I wasn't sure, and I looked at the members-only jacket, and I've read that blog, the dance  talk, it's unbelievably good.  Right.  Very interesting.  But I felt that no matter how brilliant Chase is, most viewers wouldn't pick up on stuff  like camera angles.  That's true, yeah.  Like, that's the type of thing, that's the way they analyze the JFK assassination. 
[01:14:00]  There are some things that you kind of have to tell people, and most people are not watching.  Even smart people, you know, directors watching it, wouldn't pick up on point of view, point  of view, like, oh, that was his point of view, wait a minute, this Meadows Park, it's just  too, it's too much put together after the fact.  I just think because it was, it was so, it was done so many times, it set up a pattern  that made sense, you know?  Like, if it was done once, you'd be like, oh, you know, who's going to pick up on that 
[01:14:30]  and stuff?  But it was such a pattern, the way it always happened with that bell ringing and someone  walking in.  You know, when it first aired, everyone was obviously so fucking annoyed.  They were pissed.  Most people, the masses anyway, I'm sure some people weren't at first, but as time goes  by, you're like, god damn, what a great ending to a series.  Yeah, perfect.  You know, it really is.  But you're so annoyed at the beginning.  You're not going to be spoon-fed, but the more you think about it.  I remember just sitting there, looking at the clock, and looking at the screen, going, 
[01:15:00]  oh my god.  What the fuck?  There's no time left for anything.  Right.  What the fuck?  And then it just goes out.  Remember, we did a whole fucking show on it.  Motherfuckers.  Livid.  Motherfucker.  But now you're like, yeah, right on, man.  Props to David Chase for doing something different.  The best explanation I heard for it was that this is what his life is like.  Everybody is suspicious.  Every moment is like this.  And that made sense.  Like, because that's, like, in any other time in the series, there was no way to build up  the amount of tension. 
[01:15:30]  That's because everybody was looking at the clock.  All right.  Who is this guy?  What is this guy doing?  Why is he standing there?  That's his life.  That's his life.  So they address that, too, by saying if you watch that last episode, you're looking at  everybody going, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.  But Tony, if you look, when they show these people, Tony's not even caring.  He's looking at the menu.  He's looking at the door.  But it's not this.  He's not going, like, looking over his shoulder.  He's the one that isn't going crazy looking at everybody and being suspicious. 
[01:16:00]  Can we go with the heart attack thing again?  He's the type of guy, Tony Soprano and the people around him, they all would just assume  eventually someone is going to fucking take him out, right?  Yeah.  And then in the end, he fucking just dies of a heart attack on the spot or an aneurysm.  You know what I mean?  It's something that no one expected that would happen to a guy like Tony Soprano.  They would have to leave.  They'd have to give you some kind of indication.  I think that he would have indicated.  Well, it's the onion rings. 
[01:16:30]  It's right there.  The goddamn onion rings.  You know, I always believe that that was just, even though he's not paying, he's paying  attention to the menu and he's talking to his family, that stuff's just there.  Like, that's what life is like, is every person, even though he's not staring at everybody.  He just knows it's all around him.  That's what it is.  It's always around him.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe we can look up more.  Maybe he's one of the guys in the back of the room.  It might be something more.  But then he dies another way that no one was expecting.  Yeah.  I'm going to go with that a little bit.  Watch him say a safe felt to the ceiling.  Safe. 
[01:17:00]  Some dumb thing.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  You know what?  Fucking five years later.  Still talking about it.  Still yapping about it.  Amazing.  I know.  But I felt so sad having to tell you that because you're so happy.  I know.  I'm like, oh.  Were you sad?  Jimmy.  Jimmy couldn't wait.  No, but I didn't want to because I know it was a good discussion.  But I'm like.  But why?  I thought.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  He's a fucking.  He's fucking with everybody then.  Yeah.  Is David Chase trustworthy?  I don't know.  Would he just do a dumb interview?  Because that's. 
[01:17:30]  He plays that game too.  Like, all right.  This is what the fucking people want.  So I'm just going to throw this out there.  And he's apparently seems to have changed his opinions over the years with other interviews.  I don't know.  Maybe it's open to your interpretation, man.  I hate open to my interpretation.  I didn't fucking write it.  Give me an ending, goddamn you.  All right.  Why don't we take another break so we can finish breakfast?  You didn't even eat your shit.  I know.  I want to eat my shit.  And I don't want to do it on the air. 
[01:18:00]  And then we'll get into the Green Day.  The Green Day clip is great.  Yeah.  I guess Billy Joe is in rehab now.  Yeah.  That's a dumb.  Go off to rehab.  It's one of those bullshit rehab.  Bullshit rehab?  Yeah.  Because he acted like an idiot.  When you act like an idiot, you got to go into rehab.  But then again.  Then again, did he?  But then again, did he?  That tattoo.  I ordered for the table.  It's the worst tattoo ever.  That is a terrible tattoo.  I mean, they got all four wrong. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, it's terrible.  That's an awful tattoo.  It's unbelievable.  I ordered for the table.  Is that?  You know whose tattoo that is, right?  Is that Eastside Dave's?  Yeah.  Oh my God.  It's Eastside Dave.  Who did that?  Terrible tattoo artist.  Why isn't that picture?  That should be viral.  Oh, it's terrible.  It's the worst tattoo ever.  And Eastside Dave has it.  How's your new mic working out, Sam?  It's not bad.  You keep leaning into talking.  You are leaning into it.  I can, but it's not like something that you would want to move all the time. 
[01:19:00]  It's something new.  Not like this.  Right.  Well, pull it out.  So how far out does it come?  Because Rob Cross gave Sam the new.  To try it out.  That's how far it comes out.  But maybe it would be good.  Leave it there.  Maybe it would be good for your spot and that spot for the guests.  Because it's all about trying to get a good shot and video of the guests.  It would just be a little more complicated putting it to their mouths when we have to adjust the mic for them.  Right.  Well, maybe we tell them ahead of time, look, you know this shit, so how about you fucking eat the mic?  We don't have time to tell them ahead of time because they come in and we're on the air. 
[01:19:30]  Are we on the air?  Well, we can set it up for them.  We can have the mic ready.  Can you downward angle that if it wasn't for your computer screen where it's downward and the mic's pointing up at you?  Oh.  See, we'd have a clear shot.  That's all we're looking for.  Well, yeah, he might be able to.  That's what I'm thinking.  See, look, you can see Sam's face, unfortunately.  Yeah.  I can do this.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah, can they do that?  That's a good one.  Yeah, sure.  And if every once in a while you guys got to adjust, you got to adjust.  Whatever.  How do I sound, right?  Oh, Jesus.  It's the same garbage, but I mean, your voice is clear. 
[01:20:00]  What shit.  Is that the only choice we got or are they going to give us a couple more?  I mean, I'm sure if you want more choices, you can have them.  This is just what the option was.  I mean, I think.  Jimmy, you don't want one of those, right?  We were discussing this on Friday.  Yeah.  You want one of those?  Absolutely.  Instead of this on my face all the time?  I want the pictures, too.  Yeah, I don't want it to look terrible.  That'll be closer to you, too, than that one is to him.  All right, then me and I will have these, and then we'll put three of those in.  These have more mobility, for sure.  But these are just more what you were looking for with the visual. 
[01:20:30]  These are magical.  Yeah, so half the time you can't take pictures of these guys because the whole thing blocks their faces.  These are magical.  Wherever you put them.  Yeah.  Yeah, I do like these.  Except for the squeak.  I don't mind.  The listeners love the squeak.  Oh, they hate the squeak.  No, they don't.  They hate the squeak.  We're going to break, get into the Green Day clip and some iPhone chat as well.  I think we're going to revisit Rachel because someone's video went extremely viral. 
[01:21:00]  Not a little viral, but extremely viral.  Who's Rachel?  Oh, you missed Rachel for Friday.  Oh, you were here.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good.  Then we replay it for Jimmy today.  For sure.  That's a good one.  The one thing I'll say going on a break, everyone thinks Rachel's fake.  People just...  Really?  Fake?  Totally fake.  Accusations that have been thrown at me over the weekend.  Oh, really?  You're homosexual?  Yeah.  You stink.  You're black.  Your hair is awful.  Why are you guys picking on me?  You're a cuckold.  A cuckold.  This is the OPNT Channel. 
[01:21:30]  What's SiriusXM?  In a world where one vigilante engineer disregards the law of the land.  Fuck you and your rules.  Only the strong will survive.  I'm a much bigger man than you are.  Marcelino Centeno is...  We're gonna fight.  Livewire.  I'm not afraid of your information.  Engineer or no engineer.  Livewire looks to take down the bad guys at any cost.  You have a difficult personality and you're an asshole. 
[01:22:00]  But you're our engineer.  You could drop dead right now.  I wouldn't give a fuck.  Whining and complaining get you nowhere with Livewire.  I'm still waiting for a Christmas dinner from five years ago.  That's exactly my point, you stupid fuck.  Little dick motherfucker.  Couldn't even get it hard.  No action adventure will get your blood boiling like this.  Strap in, folks.  This is where it gets really exciting.  Because I'm the truth-sayer. 
[01:22:30]  Livewire.  Coming soon to a theater near you.  You're alive.  And now a reading from the book of Ted.  When the wine was gone, Ted had his disciples fill the drugs with water.  And then a miracle occurred.  And Ted said...  I took water and I turned it into crystal light.  The wine was now crystal light.  When the food was gone, Ted's disciples gathered.  And the Lord Ted proclaimed...  I took a bunch of fishes and turned them into more fishes by cutting them in half. 
[01:23:00]  I have 30 fishes and I should, like, present E with 60 half-fishes.  It was the second miracle Ted had performed.  And Ted then divided the fish among them.  I'm working miracles!  The king was not impressed and ordered Ted to be arrested.  Oh, no!  They misunderstood me!  Ted shouted as he tried to explain himself.  I had an erection.  It was tenting out of my robe beautifully.  But the guards just ignored him.  And Ted was taken away. 
[01:23:30]  The Lord Ted was to be crucified.  Ow!  My hands and feet are hurting!  Ted shouted as the nails were driven into his flesh.  As the crowd looked on, Ted looked to the people and announced...  I have it!  I have it!  It's not!  You go, it's foreign!  Whatever that means, this has been a reading from the book of Ted.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  You're listening to O.P. 
[01:24:00]  I want to know how E-Rock's weekend was. 
[01:24:30]  We were talking football and Emmys and...  E to the R.  Some iPhone 5 shit.  What did E-Rock do?  Make a steak shake?  Oh, Jesus.  E-Rock!  Hello.  What'd you do, man?  I hung out at my house.  Oh.  Like I do every weekend.  Well, what'd you do?  Did you watch the Emmys?  Did you watch football?  I watched the Emmys, yes.  Your girl's a big sports fan, right?  She was watching football, yeah. 
[01:25:00]  He's married...  I guess there's a few out there, but he has...  You don't have a desire to watch any sports, really, right?  I'll watch it if she's watching it, but I'll never turn it off.  She's the big sports fan of the film.  Oh, there it is.  Is that old school shit?  Because I think that's just weird.  That you wouldn't be into sports, but your wife would be.  A little weird.  That's a little strange to me.  Yeah.  It's gay.  It's embarrassing.  Is that like...  I don't watch sports, but I would start watching sports if my wife did, because that's way  worse.  To have a wife who watches sports when you don't is way worse. 
[01:25:30]  It's emasculating a little bit.  Very emasculating.  Yeah.  We all know E-Rock's wife.  She's great.  She's the greatest.  She's awesome.  And she really...  Her eyesight is terrible.  Oh, my God.  She also has very poor judgment.  She might need her eyes checked, but besides that...  But she's a huge Devils fan in hockey, and she likes the Giants, I would assume.  Yeah.  And really gets into it.  Big Giants fan, Yankees, and the Devils.  And you could care less.  Or couldn't care less?  How does that work?  Yeah, I know.  Because people...  Both are acceptable.  I say it goes both ways. 
[01:26:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  He likes...  He goes both ways, boys and men.  Right.  Yeah.  No interest in it.  None.  It's all right to watch, but I just don't want to follow it.  So what do you do while your wife's watching football?  Yeah, what do you do?  Legos.  Watch Cake Boss and...  Writes fan fiction?  Sure.  What were you actually doing while she was watching football yesterday?  Yes.  While she was watching football, I was watching the red carpet and the Emmys.  Oh, no. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, God.  What a fucking mo.  Just take a dick in your ass.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  That's the worst answer he could have given.  Yeah.  Like, I don't know what the answer could be that would be better.  Anything would be better.  I was on my period would be better.  I mean, hysterectomy.  Why would you...  He was watching the Fashion Police while his wife was watching football.  Oh, my God.  Oh, E-Rock, you're horrendous.  Did you enjoy the manicam?  The manicam, E-Rock?  No, it was fucking horrible.  Oh.  Manning up right there. 
[01:27:00]  It's so dumb.  Did you see the manicam, man?  No.  I didn't either.  I just heard it.  What is that?  Of course I didn't see it.  What is it?  Of course I didn't.  What'd you hear about it, then?  Hey, man.  I gotta know a little bit about everything.  Like the Anthony guy there.  Yeah, that's why I watched the Jeff Probst show the other day.  There you go.  You gotta do a little research on it.  Stunk on ice.  They had this stupid box with a little red carpet in it.  Who I should call it?  They got this jumping on it.  The box was like, I don't know.  Let's call it a double shoe box.  And inside was a mini red carpet with the logos on the side and stuff. 
[01:27:30]  And then the women, and I'm not gonna lie to you, a few of them did it in such a way  I'm like, fuck, that's pretty fucking hot.  Because they would walk their hands in on the red carpet to show a dumb handbag or their  nails or something.  Yeah.  But some of the girls knew how to fucking work their hands where, you know.  Yeah.  Really?  I thought so.  Like a hand model.  Yeah, but you're thinking what that would look like on your balls.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, really?  Is that what you're thinking?  I don't know, man.  Is that what you're thinking when you see a lady's hand? 
[01:28:00]  Give me a bunch of spiders.  Give me one.  Is that a video?  No.  Find a video.  There was, I wish I wrote down.  Thank you, Thing.  There was one woman that did it, and I was like, holy fuck, that's sexy.  Yeah.  Did she do the jerking off thing?  That would be funny.  Put your hand in the box and just jerk off.  But then other women did it, and you could tell they just, they have to be stiffs in bed  because they can't work their hand right.  I think it says a lot.  Fucking arthritis, bent knuckles. 
[01:28:30]  Give Ruth Gordon's hand.  Give Ruth Gordon.  Some big liver-spotted, translucent, veiny hand.  Well, Iroch, you didn't like the manicam, no?  Oh, who cares?  Well, you cared.  You were watching.  You were watching.  So were you, apparently.  Ah.  I watched that.  I watched football.  I was all over the place, yeah.  I didn't watch football, so that's the only difference.  No, you'd sit in there, and they have nothing to talk about, so put your hand in the box  and pretend that your hand is walking like it's on the red carpet.  Now, walk us through this.  So then do you walk into the living room and go, hey, honey, how's the game? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Need any snacks?  Need any snacks?  You need any refills?  I know you don't want to get up off the couch because this is an amazing game.  Yeah.  Honey.  I'm going to go back into the den and watch the Emmys.  Yeah, I'm going to go fucking traipse back into my man cave.  Yeah, right.  It's got like a fucking satin curtain in front of it.  You should see Louis Dreyfus, whatever the fuck her name is.  Hmm. 
[01:29:30]  Had nothing.  I don't know.  Had nothing there.  I just fucking did it.  No, you were going to say Louis C.K., but then you were going for Julia Louis Dreyfus.  Yeah, I fucked up her name, and then I said, oh, boy.  Julia Louis C.K.  Yeah, it's not going to really help the bit.  All right.  That's what E-Rock did this weekend.  Sounds fabulous.  What a fabulous weekend.  You know who's making me laugh on Twitter?  Patton Oswalt, because he was tweeting Romney Dangerfield.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Romney Dangerfield.  That was fucking really funny.  Patton Oswalt is a great one on Twitter. 
[01:30:00]  There you go.  Look.  With the fingers.  They're manipulating the fingers.  Yeah.  There was something about it.  I've got to be honest with you.  What came up with that idea?  It wasn't bad.  I was like, that's kind of sexy.  Jesus.  Did you hear your wife yelling when the game gets exciting?  Yeah, I don't think.  I'm obsessed with this.  I'm sorry, Rob.  Usually, it's when the Giants game was on, but I don't think she was watching the Giants  game.  Because she likes looking at men.  Yeah.  Oh.  That's why she watches.  She never gets to see any.  Yeah, she's all these in-shape guys with their little butts, and then you lumber in. 
[01:30:30]  Wait.  She's such a football fan.  The Giants obviously didn't play yesterday, so she was watching other football games?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  This broad likes her football.  Jeez.  Good for her.  How could you not just keep up appearances and just sit there pretending to be interested  with her?  Like, I can't imagine going into another room to watch a feminine show.  You're in separate rooms.  He's watching a show, and there's commercials for hair dye and nail polish, and his wife 
[01:31:00]  is watching football.  Who gets relegated to the small TV?  You or her?  There's no small TV.  Oh, shit.  He's a consumer.  He is America.  Of course.  Big screens everywhere.  But not only is he not watching football, he's watching the polar opposite of football.  He really is.  Yeah.  I just don't care.  You guys want to have a show together called My Husband's a Queer.  I respect that you don't care.  It's just, it's a strange scenario. 
[01:31:30]  That's all.  I don't think there's a lot of couples out there that are like that.  Yeah.  Where the woman is the big sports fan, and the guy is the fucking flaming fruit.  Does she make more of the decisions, too?  Like, in general?  Like, do you think she wears the pants, or you do?  I don't know.  Let me ask her.  Is she a jersey broad, meaning she wears the jersey on Sundays for the football?  She wears giant stuff when the game's on, you know?  And do you?  I am definitely the boss in my house. 
[01:32:00]  She's walking around with the giant's jersey.  What are you walking around in?  Probably a Doctor Who t-shirt or something.  Oh, God.  Ugh.  It's fucking rules.  Ugh.  It's weird, right?  It's...  Yes.  Doctor Who.  That's why I love E-Rock.  He never disappoints.  There's always something going on with him.  He never disappoints because he always disappoints.  There's always something going on with him that's a little different.  But then he gets, like, indignant.  And then he gets mad.  Yeah, like, why would you even bring this up?  Right.  Because guess what?  No one else is calling.  Because I... 
[01:32:30]  It's a very...  It's a very rare situation.  It really is.  There's nobody saying, what are you talking about?  My wife watches football while I watch fashion police all the time.  I think there's a lot of couples that they both watch.  Sure.  My wife doesn't really watch football, really.  Well, that's not weird at all.  I'll try to explain stuff to her.  She goes, all right, whatever, cool.  Enjoy, whatever.  But then there's other, like, couples.  They both are totally into it.  Or they both don't watch.  But there's very few couples where the woman watches football while the man goes and watches E. 
[01:33:00]  There's actually none.  They're the only couple.  That's why no one talks about it.  I think so.  Because people don't know if it's real.  Come on.  One person call and tell me you're just like E-Rock.  I mean, with E-Rock's situation, I should say.  Watching Ryan Seacrest while your wife is watching Al Michaels.  Yeah.  Oh, E-Rock.  It is what it is.  Yes, it is.  It works, right, E-Rock?  I'm not going to fight it.  I don't care about sports.  I agree with you.  I don't either.  But I'm usually not with people that like the sports. 
[01:33:30]  Right.  Especially females, you know.  Kind of emasculating.  A little bit.  No, you like sports.  Not as much.  Not as much, no.  You like your Yankees.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You do the UFC.  But baseball isn't even like really liking sports.  You just sit there watching a dumb game like baseball.  I think like football, that's a fucking man's sport right there.  I think I'm officially not a baseball fan anymore.  Yeah.  For a long time, I was making believe I was still a Mets fan.  And then one day I woke up and realized, wait, I'm not really a Mets fan.  No.  But now I got to say, I don't think I'm a baseball fan in general. 
[01:34:00]  No.  No.  No.  I kind of, especially.  We had those amazing seats at the Yankees game.  And me and my brother just talked about old family shit and drank beers and laughed our asses off.  And then when we were walking to my car, we're like, God, that was a lot of fun.  And then I realized it was a lot of fun, but we didn't see the game.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is.  When you go to the game, especially when you got good seats like that, you're having a conversation  under the threat of being hit in the head with something doing fucking 150 miles an hour. 
[01:34:30]  It really is frightening.  Let me have a conversation and maybe get a concussion.  I'm going to go this year to the Yankee game.  Or maybe this year.  You better hurry.  Maybe this year.  You should.  We got this connection for these seats.  Did anybody watch UFC?  No.  I fucking didn't rent it this.  I think I said this, but this is the one I should have rented.  Yeah.  I rent it like once every third, I would say.  You can watch them online, the streaming.  It's like watching a television.  It's an amazing fucking streaming service they have. 
[01:35:00]  Amazing.  However they do it.  So you can just watch it on your laptop?  That's what I did in a hotel, and it was awesome quality.  You don't get loading, loading, loading.  No.  Buffering, buffering, buffering.  It might have buffered once for a half second.  It was amazing.  I know Jon Jones won, but how was his fight?  Was it good?  He almost lost in the first round.  That's what I heard.  He got arm barred or almost completely.  His arm looks hyperextended.  How the fuck did he get out of it?  He picked up Belfort and dropped.  It was like picking up a baby and dropping him. 
[01:35:30]  But he fucking, he really is a great athlete to get out of that.  He said he was going to let Belfort break his arm.  Anyone that thinks Jon Jones is not tough, I couldn't fucking believe he got out of that.  Because his arm was bent backwards.  Right.  And it was hurting the whole fight.  And at the end of the fight, he was holding, gingerly holding it.  And he told Joe it was numb.  Wow.  He almost lost that fight.  Now, are the fans cool with Jon Jones, or how did that work out?  They booed him a little bit.  But Belfort was, Belfort gave him a better fight than I thought he would have. 
[01:36:00]  But in the end, the fans respected Jon Jones again?  Well, yeah.  No, he's great.  He's just great.  Well, he had that thing last month.  That thing.  Can you find the fight, Sam?  No, they took it down.  Here's Mars.  He knows a little bit about a UFC.  He doesn't know how to wear a UFC shirt properly.  Is he wearing, is that actually the Constitution, or is that...  Yes, it is.  Oh, I thought it was a UFC version.  But it's a Tap Out logo under the Constitution.  Wait, is it?  Why do you have a Constitution t-shirt on?  It was free?  What does Tap Out have to do with... 
[01:36:30]  Wait, that is a Tap Out shirt.  It is.  I thought for once he wasn't wearing...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A goofy fucking shirt.  Although we like the Tap Out guys.  That one's at least a little better than the other ones.  Why?  Gentlemen, it's a free shirt.  Come on.  What was the one you were wearing Friday?  We never got to it.  It was just as bad as the other ones.  The grapple, I think.  Was it...  Oh, God.  I hate the grapple one.  Snapple?  Right.  I think it was another one.  Ah, whatever.  What do you got there?  Oh, why that shirt?  Yeah, Ann wants to know.  Why the Constitution would Tap Out.  I don't get it. 
[01:37:00]  I have no idea.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  That's great.  That's all you needed?  We were...  I saw you walking down the hall, so I thought you heard us talking about the UFC.  You wanted to come in and comment.  Well, you know what?  You have perfect timing, man, because that's the one fight that I didn't watch.  Oh.  You didn't watch Jon Jones?  Why?  What happened?  I'm watching it now.  Now.  Oh, so you didn't even rent this?  No.  Where are you watching it?  Some fan you are.  You wear the shirts every day.  This is the only one I miss, man.  You got it, Tim?  Put the website in. 
[01:37:30]  It's in the USP drive.  Oh.  All right.  So you have nothing on this.  They took it off.  Were the other fights good, Jimmy?  Yeah.  I watched...  Yeah.  The Bisping fight was good.  And Demetrius Johnson...  I forget the guy who fought Benavidez.  It was a great flyweight fight.  Yeah.  I enjoyed it very much.  I want to see Jon Jones.  I'm a dummy, man.  I should have rented this.  He really almost lost that fight.  Oh, you know what?  I know why.  I decided I want to go see Bill Burr and Joe DeRosa at Caroline's. 
[01:38:00]  How was DeRosa...  I heard DeRosa had a big argument with Troy Kwan on Friday.  Oh, yes.  Oh, my God.  You missed a great show on Friday.  Yeah, I know.  Was it...  Bill was in and Joe?  Yeah.  I'm not going to tell us.  And Dave is the funniest guy in life.  Dave is fucking great, man.  He's unbelievably funny.  Yeah.  That...  Because he's brilliant.  That was fun.  It's unbelievable how funny he is.  Just dumb stuff, too.  Yeah.  Bill Burr and Joe DeRosa was going after Troy because Troy was going after DeRosa.  And then it just got ugly.  Did it really?  Yeah, because Troy said the thing that a comic just doesn't want to hear, especially a working 
[01:38:30]  comic like Joe.  You have hair like Carmine Ragusa?  He said, you're not funny.  Told him he's just not funny.  That made me laugh.  And then he said he took his chick to one of Joe's shows on a Sunday, and he was embarrassed.  I had to apologize to the chick.  It was so fucking brutal.  And then Joe just stood up and just started, fuck you.  But then he failed because he goes, you're fucking with my livelihood. 
[01:39:00]  Can I hear some of that, please?  My livelihood.  Oh, my God.  I apologize to the fans.  I would love to hear a little bit of that.  We should have had a clip for you waiting today because you're sort of in that stand-up  world.  Yeah.  And don't apologize to the fans.  There's no way anybody doesn't want to hear it again.  I want to hear a moment of it at least for five minutes or two minutes of it.  I think we made it pretty clear.  Like, no one in the room agreed with Troy Kwan's point of view.  That's his...  No.  He really believes Joe DeRose is not funny.  And he has every right to think that.  But there wasn't another guy in the room that agreed with that. 
[01:39:30]  But we didn't feel like it was our fight to jump in.  You know, it was up to Joe to fight his way out of it.  Oh, yeah.  And Troy's allowed to have that.  I mean, look, I wouldn't want to hear that as a comic.  There's a lot of that opinion.  Of course.  I would hate to hear that.  But where's Troy?  I have no problem with Troy Kwan saying what he believes is, you know, true or whatever.  Could someone get Troy?  I just want to ask him for a minute.  I don't want to rehash him.  He's coming in right now.  Oh, I don't want to rehash the whole thing.  I just...  There he is.  I'm just curious.  I heard about it.  And I never saw Troy let loose like that.  What happened?  Got crazy on Friday. 
[01:40:00]  Did he haircut, didn't he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just...  He got a little out of control, but...  Did you and Joe make up?  Kind of.  Nah, nah.  This is a real one.  He sort of made him, made him like shaking shit, but there was nothing real there.  Why did the fight get out of hand?  I just...  Well, I just, you know, I mean, you know how it is.  You just, you just start throwing punches and you just, it gets...  You really don't think he's funny though, huh?  He's a nice guy.  Oh, jeez.  Well, I mean, I'm not...  I don't look.  I mean, you kind of put me on the spot with this, but I mean...  No, I'm not. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, and if you don't think he's funny, you have every right to say that.  I saw him do stand-up one time and I, you know, it wasn't his best.  It wasn't your cup of tea?  Let me ask you this.  Yeah.  Who do you like in the stand-up world?  Oh, I mean...  Give me five.  Past, present, whatever.  Well...  His side.  Bill Burr is great.  Patrice is, you know, amazing.  Yes.  Jim's stand-up is always awesome.  Oh, Troy.  Jim, were you hoping he was going to say you? 
[01:41:00]  Yes, and a part of me was kind of hoping he wouldn't because it would be really good  to not get.  It would be embarrassing.  Yeah.  No, Jim is great.  Jim is fucking hysterical.  We all know that.  Amy Schumer is great live.  Yes.  All right, so you're naming some quality fucking comics, which makes it even worse.  Yeah, it's not like he's giving a bad axe.  Yeah, if you said Yakov, Shmiernoff...  No, Yakov was funny.  True.  You're right.  You're right.  In my day...  Oh.  So who threw the first punch between Troy and Joe?  Well, we might have stirred the pot a little bit. 
[01:41:30]  Well, it carried over from the last time they had a tiff on the air.  Because Troy would have...  You remember their last fight.  You were here for their first fight, right?  I don't know if I was.  Well, they were fighting because it was in, like, July, and Joe was making fun of Troy's  dress.  It's apparel.  And, like, two days before Joe...  What?  He's apparel.  Apparel.  His clothes.  Yeah, and I understand what it means, but apparel is what happens when you're in trouble.  Isn't it apparel?  Apparel.  Apparel.  Apparel.  Apparel. 
[01:42:00]  Not apparel.  Oh, my God.  And I speak shitty, but I know that one.  Apparel.  You really are a weirdo.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Apparel.  Anyway.  Is that something you picked up when you were living overseas?  Apparel?  I don't know.  Apparel.  Anyway, what?  Anyway.  Anyway.  So, but Joe came to me, like, two days before Joe was coming in this time.  This was months after their fight, and he goes, you know, Joe kind of rubs me the wrong  way.  I wish I had gotten him harder in July.  Oh, boy.  I was like, what are you talking about? 
[01:42:30]  He was like, it's just, it still rubs me the wrong way.  I wish, I kind of went easy on him.  I wish I had gotten harder.  So then I told Opie that Troy had said that, and then Opie...  Might have said it on the air.  I don't know.  I thought it would be a quick call.  And it's just something that was like a conversation between Sam and I, but it came to the air.  That's fine.  I mean, you know, that's when you work with the show, that's what happens.  No, but I mean, yeah, if you're bringing up show shit, that's not a conversation between  you and Sam.  No, I know, but it's...  You didn't have a problem with me bringing it to you.  No, it's fine.  I mean, it's when you tell Sam shit like that, it's, you know, that's what happens. 
[01:43:00]  So, and that's fine.  And then it just, it got heated, and then, you know, you start throwing punches, and, you  know, I definitely don't want to fuck with the guy's, you know, livelihood.  Why did he say livelihood?  Oh, he did.  He got slammed for that.  Because Troy, I mean...  Yeah, you're taking shots at my livelihood.  No, he didn't.  Because Joe was defending himself pretty good, and then when he said livelihood, it was like,  oh, gee, Joe.  Everything just went to shit.  God.  Joe, did he really say livelihood?  Oh, yeah, he did.  Yes.  Oh, and then we brought it up.  Mented.  Oh, no.  Uncle Joe.  Uncle Joe.  We might have brought it up a hundred times after he said it.  We might have.  Yes.  And he got really upset because Troy said that he should be on this show less. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, right.  And that's when he brought up the livelihood again.  Oh, boy.  Can we do a montage of every time livelihood was brought up?  I just want to hear it once.  Do we have...  Where's the clip?  I know.  Sam, can we find one?  Do you have it online or do we have it?  Sam, I don't have the clip in front of me.  E-Rock, please.  What are you doing back there?  Stop eating toenails.  Okay.  He's eating a bowl of dry toenails.  He's trying to cut down on carbs.  Yeah, I definitely...  I felt bad about it.  This weekend was like...  You know, because I'm not trying to fuck with the dude, you know? 
[01:44:00]  But...  Well, on-air fights are...  Oof.  Are brutal, but...  You know what, Troy?  What's up?  I wouldn't feel bad.  Why's that?  Because that's your opinion.  It is my opinion, but I don't want...  Was he fucking with you two, though?  I mean, he was hitting me back.  That's fine.  You know, and...  Who started it?  Well, it basically started with the...  You know, Sam going to the guys about it,  and then they brought it up,  and then they asked me about it on the air,  and so I... 
[01:44:30]  Fine.  I mean, it...  A lot of people.  I totally understand.  And people were upset about it.  I mean, there's a lot of DeRosa fans  that were pissed off about it.  Twitter was not kind to you.  No.  What do you have to say about that?  It's fine, man.  Everybody has their opinion,  and that's...  Everybody...  You know, if you're a fan of DeRosa,  I would see why you'd be upset about it, so...  A lot of guys don't like Troy  because they know Troy  could probably fuck their girlfriends.  Oh, man.  But then he reminds you  of the guy who bangs your chick,  and that's why a lot of guys  have a predisposition  to not like Troy.  No one likes that.  But that's what it is.  He's, you know...  Yeah.  A lot of the guys don't like him.  Oh, Iraq found the clip. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, good.  Oh.  And he can't let it go.  No, I can't.  He can't let it go.  So that's fine that he can't let it go.  I wasn't screaming at you  when you walked in here  because you couldn't let it go.  I started fucking yelling at you  because you're sitting there now  taking shots at my fucking livelihood  and trying to get me off the fucking show.  What kind of fucking man are you?  Seriously.  Well, first of all,  like I said,  Opie asked my opinion,  and I asked him,  I said,  do you want to know my opinion?  That's my opinion.  I know.  I love it.  Wow.  Oh, I forgot.  And the biggest bitch move of all 
[01:45:30]  is when you're taking shots  at my livelihood,  so go fuck yourself.  After you took shots at mine,  you're going to dish it out  and fuck your chicken.  Stop taking shots  at each other's livelihoods.  Exactly.  Josh, don't point at me  at my livelihood.  Don't you point at me  at my livelihood.  Who the fuck says  livelihood?  My livelihood.  Borwalk Empire,  what's going on?  Pillings parade.  Tell go,  take a knee. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, yeah.  All right,  take a knee.  Take a knee.  Wow.  Just Borwalk Empire.  There's the livelihood.  Oh, my God.  But they were going at it  like that  and worse  for like a good hour  straight.  Oh, cool.  It's a great, great fight.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Those are the best.  And I know that they  shouldn't be the best,  but it's just something  so different than  you want it, you know?  Because you can't get  an authentic,  real thing like that  happening whenever you want. 
[01:46:30]  It's just got to happen.  Right.  And it did.  Oof.  Boy, did it.  These two.  It just spirals out of control.  You just start,  you know,  spouting off at the mouth  and, you know,  all of a sudden  and you're like,  oh, shit.  They're calling you  the ultimate prick right now.  Oh.  But why do they think  he's the ultimate prick  if him and DeRosa,  and I'm not shitting on Joe,  I like Joe,  but if they were throwing  punches at each other,  why is Troy the prick?  Unless I missed something.  Because they don't agree  with what Troy said.  That's fair enough.  I don't think you're a prick.  You're brutally honest, Troy. 
[01:47:00]  Joe didn't really go at him.  Oh, okay.  I didn't see Joe really,  he was hammering you a bit,  you know.  Because in the end,  Joe's just a nice guy.  Well, no,  Joe could be a prick.  He tries not to be on this show  because he's always, like,  worried about hurting  someone's feelings and shit.  Maybe he's not right  for this show.  If you say somebody's not funny,  I mean, why is...  You can't care about  someone's feelings in this show.  Why is that?  I mean, Jim,  if I told you,  I'm like,  you're not funny.  Like, who the fuck am I?  Like, why would you care about  what...  Well, as a comic, though.  Intellectually, you're correct.  But to a comic, 
[01:47:30]  that's a real...  That's...  Tremendous...  Because it's...  And again,  it's hard to defend.  Here's what happens.  This is why...  This is livelihood.  Here's why this gets nasty so quick.  If somebody yells  from the audience something,  you can play with it.  But if someone yells,  you're not funny,  that is an absolute  and definitive,  no room for interpretation,  no room to play with it.  Like, there's no way  to win playfully.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, you can't win playfully 
[01:48:00]  with you're not funny.  What they've done  is they've basically  thrown down a gauntlet.  I'm not joking with you.  I'm not having fun with you.  I'm not trying to make this  into something.  Fuck you.  It's an absolute  fuck you  with no room for interpretation.  So, as a comic,  when you deal with that  from the stage, at least,  you deal with it brutally.  Because, like,  there was a...  At the cellar,  I was not there.  But some comic was on stage  and a woman in the audience,  I guess, 
[01:48:30]  with a Russian girl  with her boyfriend  or whatever,  and they had been, like,  talking in Russian,  doing some shit.  I didn't...  Obviously, I was in Columbus,  but then she yelled,  boring!  Oh, boy.  And I didn't...  Again, the comic,  ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba,  and called her a cunt.  Here you go.  He was absolutely right  to call her a cunt  because boring  is not trying  to be fun or playful.  No.  It's basically...  It's standing up  and saying to the comedian,  fuck you.  So the comic's job  is to, yeah,  fuck you, cunt. 
[01:49:00]  Right.  It's to up by one.  But...  So if you say  someone's not funny,  that's why they're going  to respond viciously  because they have to  up it by one.  If that makes any sense.  There's no way  to do it funny.  Actually, it makes  a lot of sense.  I can't think of a funny  way to respond to that.  Yeah.  Unless it's so  obviously playful,  like, I can't think  of a fun way  to respond to that.  No, a joke  just kind of responded  by, you know,  picking apart  your livelihood.  Yeah, exactly.  And that's fine.  I mean, why would I get... 
[01:49:30]  I mean, everybody  just busts people's balls  here all the time  and say how much...  I mean, more importantly,  where's my vegetable juice  today there, Troy Kwan?  You gotta get them  to run out for it.  I'm all for a fucking  good vegetable juice.  I love a good carrot juice  with a little ginger.  Carrie wants one too.  That's the way to go.  Let's go.  I've been eating too much fruit.  I eat a lot of fruit  in Columbus.  Fruit.  How was Columbus?  We haven't even talked  about it.  It was great.  It was really, really great.  I love the area.  I love doing the city.  Like, it's in a mall area,  but it was...  They're kind of like Ohio.  Look at Jimmy,  all grown up  and doing a town. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, we walked  to Trader Joe's.  I went to the gym  every day.  It was fucking great, man.  I have a huge  lifestyle gym.  Really?  And I was doing the fucking...  Like, where you kneel  on the machine.  I have a good gym  in my building,  but it's nothing  like a fucking...  A genuine gym.  Yeah.  And it's like  where you kneel  on the thing  and you work  your obliques.  Oh, the little spinny thing?  I'm very sore.  I'm still sore  from fucking...  Oh, God.  Saturday.  Yeah.  Crowds were good.  They were great, yeah.  They loved their football  up there.  Yeah, someone gave  an Ohio yell  after it's on Ohio State, right?  He was admonished firmly. 
[01:50:30]  I want to little  of the song  before he freaks out  because Danny  was telling me  this morning  that he wasn't  sounding too good  before they cut his mic.  Really?  This is a big clip today.  Green Day was playing  the...  I Heart Radio.  What the fuck  is the I Heart Radio  music festival?  Have they been doing this  for a while?  Something radio puts on,  I'm sure.  Yeah, they did it a lot.  That's Clear Channel's thing.  The past, like,  two or three years...  Queer Channel.  They get every act  to do it because...  Do people really love radio?  No.  No.  No one does.  So, I Heart Radio, 
[01:51:00]  you like radio,  you might love personalities  that do radio.  I love it.  But I love radio  in general.  It's stupid.  Can I tell you, though,  what a genius response,  though, to Satellite.  You think?  Absolutely.  And it was...  They've done much better  with it than they should have,  which is why Satellite  has to fucking stay  on top of things  because regular radio,  as much as they do stink,  there are some smart people there.  And that was...  Are they getting Green Day  for events like that?  That's big.  They have to... 
[01:51:30]  They're the only game in town.  No, but you know, yeah.  For the bands.  It's like they extort them  into performing.  And they own all the venues.  Yeah.  Well, what we're about to hear,  most people have heard it by now,  but Billy Joe of Green Day  freaks out  because they cut him off.  I guess they had  some kind of clock  basically saying,  you've got to finish  your performance by this time.  He saw the clock winding down  and I think he still didn't play  one of his new songs  or something,  which was important for him  and the band.  So all of a sudden 
[01:52:00]  it hit him like,  wait, I got one minute left  and I can't get a new song played?  I think that's what  I was sort of hearing.  So all of a sudden  he said, fuck this  and just fucking lose his mind.  And I guess the reason  he had to get off stage  was so Usher could come on.  Yeah.  But wasn't it just  Usher's time to get on the...  How did that work?  Well, they said that  first they were saying  Usher went over.  Like his time,  he went over.  So then...  Oh wait, Usher wasn't next?  No.  Usher already played?  Usher was before.  Oh, so Usher took  some of Green Day's time.  But now they're saying  that he might not have at all 
[01:52:30]  and that Billy Joe  was just being a dick.  I'll blame Usher.  But it could have been  that Usher went over, yeah.  Okay, that's what  they've sort of been saying.  The first story was  that Usher went over.  Oh, all right.  And so Billy Joe was upset.  But some say  he was pretty wasted here  with this Billy Joe cat.  And we got a little  bit of his singing  before he loses it.  Are these the brothers?  Who's the brothers?  Which was the band  with the brothers?  Oh, Oasis.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Love the Oasis brothers.  I don't know  if this was the same clip  that Danny had.  So you can send me that,  Danny, if you want.  But this is this clip. 
[01:53:00]  Uh-uh.  Oh, what is that sound like?  Oh, fuck this shit.  I'm going to play  a fucking new song.  Fuck this shit.  Oh, boy.  Give me a fucking break.  One minute left.  One minute fucking left. 
[01:53:30]  You're going to give me  fucking one minute?  Look at that fucking sign  right there.  One minute.  The guitar playing.  One minute.  Let me fucking tell you  something.  Let me tell you something.  I've been around  since fucking 1980  fucking eights.  Oh, boy.  And you're going to give me  one fucking minute?  You got to be  fucking kidding me.  Child of the 80s.  You're fucking kidding me. 
[01:54:00]  What the fuck?  I'm not fucking  Justin Bieber,  you motherfuckers.  He seems wasted.  Yeah.  He does.  You got to be  fucking joking.  This is a fucking joke.  Joke.  I got one minute.  One minute left.  Oh, now I got nothing left.  Now I got nothing left.  Oh, shit.  It's not easy  to break your guitar, man.  I'll tell you right now.  Watch.  Awkward.  Awkward.  Oh, it's very hard  to break a guitar.  Awkward.  That's three.  Awkward.  Four. 
[01:54:30]  Break guitar.  The fifth one.  It's not easy  to break your guitar.  One minute.  God fucking love you all.  We'll be back.  Throws the mic.  Put his finger up  like for the one minute.  Yeah, kind of a  rock star baby boy tantrum.  Oh, yeah.  A little temper tantrum there.  It might have been.  And then people were like,  oh, what the fuck's up  with Billy Joe?  So then his dumb people  got together with him  and said, go to rehab.  We need a rehab thing here  just to calm everyone  the fuck down.  Yeah, because it's  Green with Envy  the band should be called. 
[01:55:00]  Take us out,  you fucking queer.  Take us out,  cocksucker.  That didn't merit rehab.  No.  God, rock stars  are fucking assholes.  But Green Day  is in that mainstream world,  so something like that  is a really big deal  to calm everyone down  to go to rehab.  Rehab is that fucking  bender from years ago  where it's a week  where no one knew  where you were.  You wake up in a dumpster  with a fucking needle  hanging out of your eyeball. 
[01:55:30]  But rehab will,  you know,  will fucking get you  out of a lot of shit.  But what kind of shit  was he in?  What kind of shit  is he in there?  He's kind of  in the pop music world,  really.  Yeah.  I mean,  they keep saying  it's a punk rock band.  That's a joke.  I don't think anybody's  going to not fucking  listen to him  or download his songs  because of that.  He's in a different world  than us, obviously.  That's fucking,  that's nothing.  Calm people down  and he goes to rehab  because, you know,  obviously he was  out of control.  He wasn't out of control. 
[01:56:00]  He was pissed off.  That was,  I love that shit.  In the end,  it's a real moment.  No one would have known  about this music festival  if he hadn't done that.  We were talking  about it on the air  in Columbus.  One of the shows  had somebody going  and so that's  how I heard about it.  But that's all  I heard about  was from regular radio.  Yeah.  And I did Loper's show  when I was in,  how did that work?  Really?  He reached out to me  on Twitter.  He was a Lopweiser guy.  I emailed him back  and he was actually  really cool.  Went on the Lopweiser guy show. 
[01:56:30]  I went on Lopweiser.  Did you share a Lopweiser?  He was very nice.  I couldn't,  when somebody's nice to me,  I can't be a dick.  And him and his wife  were really, really nice.  I don't want to know  that these guys  are really nice  because I just know  they are.  It just bothers me  when I go home.  Was his wife hot?  Yeah, she looks good.  It was a fun interview.  And it wasn't  total fluff.  I mean,  he's obviously  decent at what he does.  Is he doing  the Lopweiser still?  He didn't mention  that at all.  If he's not doing  the Lopweiser,  then I think we could  fucking bury the hatchet 
[01:57:00]  on this one.  Ah, here's the Lopweiser  for you.  Yeah, but I was  very surprised  that he did.  Someone out of Columbus,  is he doing the Lopweiser?  If he's not doing  the Lopweiser,  we're good.  We're good with this guy.  He had Jimmy on.  He's brand new there.  He just went in the market.  If he gets rid of Lopweisers  and doesn't use it anymore,  you could go into Lopweiser.  Nice.  You could do that.  That's what I want.  Get right in there.  If he rocks thirsty,  you could have a Lopweiser.  A Lopweiser.  Do the Lopweiser.  I got a very funny,  awful tweet  from Evan McCarthy.  Wish we had an Asian friend here.  Or a black friend. 
[01:57:30]  Evan MacArthur made me  really laugh  with this awful tweet  about the Sopranos.  He writes,  maybe like Showtime  had Dexter kill  Mr. Soprano  or something.  That Dexter killed  Mr. Soprano.  Mr. Soprano.  That's a funny fucking tweet.  It stinks, that tweet.  Very funny, though. 
[01:58:00]  People sing,  a lot of them  on the phones right now,  Jimmy killed it  in Columbus  this past weekend.  It was great.  I mean, I love that city.  It's a very underrated city  because Cleveland and, you know.  What do you do in Columbus?  I have no idea.  It's a college town,  obviously, right?  Well, we were in the mall area.  Was it nice?  It was great.  It's brand new.  I mean, it's like  a couple years old  and you walk.  There's a Trader Joe's  so I kept getting snacks  and like, you know,  fucking good, healthy snacks.  A massive gym  which we went to.  Fucking, um,  there's a movie theater. 
[01:58:30]  Kenny went to a movie  and got choked up.  Oh, no.  Yes.  Why are you just  throwing that out there  like it's nothing?  I didn't see the movie.  He doesn't get choked up usually.  What movie did he see?  Um, the cop movie.  Oh, the one with, uh,  Michael Peña  who I'm hoping.  Jake Gyllenhaal.  I want Michael Peña in here.  He was in,  he was in a fucking crash too.  He's great.  What's the cop movie?  Um,  End of Watch.  End of Watch.  Oh, right.  And, and, and  Kenny really got choked up.  I think so.  I think he was really good.  Beating an ethnic  and he's, uh,  yearning for the old.  The guy broke his nightstick 
[01:59:00]  and Kenny cried like  he won't be able  to hit him anymore.  But you could do a lot there.  There's a lot.  We ate good food every day.  I loved it, man.  I love that area  and the club is great.  It's, it's, you know,  um,  almost 300 seats  or whatever.  And it was, uh,  it's in a mall.  Yeah.  But it's really a good club.  Good.  Good.  Columbus Funny Bone.  Funny Bone of Columbus.  I don't think I've ever visited  a, did it.  Does Kenny want to come in  and talk about the cop movie?  Yeah.  Cause I, I only heard  a little bit.  It was a shitty weekend  at the box office.  Movies are,  I don't know. 
[01:59:30]  I don't want to say  they're in trouble,  but I want to see  Judge Dredd.  I'm in more and more  bad weeks.  Uh, here comes Kenny.  Kenny, uh,  movie reviews with Kenny.  That, that movie tied  number one at the box office  with some scary movie.  Oh yeah?  How's the scary movie?  I don't know.  How's the scary movie?  How's the scary movie?  How's the scary movie?  I wouldn't watch it.  I don't like scary movies.  You don't like scary movies?  You are a scary movie.  Why don't you like scary movies?  I don't like nightmares.  That what?  You have bolts in your neck 
[02:00:00]  and you're chasing people?  I don't like scary movies  because they're scary.  Well, yeah.  That's what they do.  What was the scariest movie  I've ever seen?  I saw Exorcist  back in the day.  Exorcist.  Exorcist.  Yeah?  And I walked with a bat  from my truck  to my house.  Did you really?  That's what you need  for the devil, a bat.  In case he wants to play ball.  It's the only thing I had  when I was 17.  But to some respect there,  that's a scary fucking movie. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  That's right up there, man.  So what was End of Watch about?  L.A.P.D.  Yeah?  What struck a nerve with you  in that movie that got you?  Well, people should just  go see the movie.  I don't want to ruin it for people.  Oh, you'd have to ruin it  to say, okay.  Oh, okay.  Would you have to ruin it  to say why you like it so much?  Yeah, but if anybody knows  what the title refers to.  It's like when a guy  is done with his watch  and he gets an iPhone  so he can read the time 
[02:01:00]  from that or something?  No, Peppy.  That sounds like it.  End of Watch.  I guess we didn't really  need Kenny here.  No, no.  Did he get choked up?  I'm a very emotional person.  Are you?  Yeah?  Yes.  It's been obvious to everyone.  Yes, I'm very emotional.  I'm very sensitive.  All right, well. 
[02:01:30]  But people can go to the movie  and draw their own conclusions.  Sure, I think they'll do that.  There you go.  Thanks for getting us out of this.  I want to go, by the way,  to a movie because Kenny  and I walked through the mall.  They had those theaters  where you can eat in them  and I want to go to one of those.  What do you mean, like a dinner?  Yeah, there was a dinner movie.  They're big in Austin  and I want to see one.  Genuine linen napkins  and real silverware.  Magnetic trays.  Yeah.  Plus they have cinema suites there  where I think you can do some.  Those are the candy? 
[02:02:00]  Hanky Panky.  What's a cinema suite?  I haven't come across any of these yet.  Hanky Panky.  I don't know,  but I think there's Hanky Panky  all around there.  Hanky Panky.  What, you on laughing?  You could do some of that fingering  and get some side tit.  Hanky Panky.  I love Hanky Panky.  But the dine-in thing,  I saw a picture of it.  They put like just a tray  in front of your fucking seat  and they bring you food. 
[02:02:30]  So it's like,  no, it's special.  It's still nice in a movie theater  to have that in front of your seat.  Sure.  It's exactly like fucking  Yaakov's dinner theater.  Yep.  The magnetic tray  and the fucking  ripping over your food.  Exactly.  Wait, is that the same  as the sweets?  I don't know.  I didn't see a picture  of the sweets.  Can we see a picture  of the sweets?  Yeah, I want to see  a fucking skybox  in a movie theater.  I want to go to one.  That's because everybody  yaps and everybody's around you.  Yes.  I want to go to one.  Shut up.  Cinema sweets.  Iroch will line up  because he thinks  it means candy.  Yes.  I'm sorry, Iroch.  You don't care about that.  It's a cheap joke. 
[02:03:00]  Iroch doesn't like sweets.  No, I know.  Poor football.  I don't see the picture  of the street.  Oh, they got little booths  up there like the fucking  Lincoln bullet in the head  balcony.  Yeah, I would love  to sit in one of those.  Yeah.  For a 3D picture.  Yes.  I want to see a 3D picture.  A picture.  Go to the picture show.  I want to see IMAX 3D picture  Judge Dreadful.  Stop seeing a picture, please.  Why?  That's how you should go see it.  Don't do it.  I want to see a 3D picture.  Picture.  What's wrong with seeing it? 
[02:03:30]  Wait, show that one to Jim.  Yeah, I want to see a picture  of the picture theater.  Turn it this way, Sam.  Let me see that picture.  See, that's the dine-in thing  where they just put a tray.  Oh, my God.  They're so ripping off Yakov.  Yakov.  That's his thing.  That's a comfy-looking chair.  Those seats look fucking unbelievable.  You have armrests that you raise up.  That looks great.  Is that a suite?  Your seat goes back.  That's the dine-in theater.  And there's a hard table  on the next seat  on some of them.  Yeah, look at this.  Nice.  Sam's still searching  for the cinema.  That's so great.  What a good picture. 
[02:04:00]  Stop.  I know what you're doing.  It's a good picture.  Stop.  Oh, boy.  Did I have an awful song  caught in my head yesterday?  Oh, no.  What?  What was it?  I don't know.  It just hit me.  It was so bad.  A real song  or one you made up?  Another one you made up?  I don't know where it came from.  I hate your made up songs.  Can you tell us, please?  They do stick in your head.  Jimmy was singing a good song  Saturday night.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What was it?  Two down and one to go. 
[02:04:30]  Two down and one to go.  Oh, yeah.  After my in-between shows,  I was singing the two down  and one to go song.  You had to do three shows on Saturday night.  Yeah, it's never again.  It's just too much.  It's brutal, right?  Yeah, it's a rough one.  I'm sure you pulled it off.  When you go out for the third show,  you're just like,  ugh, enough.  Well, yeah.  You're tired.  Had it with me.  You're tuckered out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We can't find that.  The sky box.  The suite.  I don't know if this is the suite or not.  I think that might be the suite.  Where you just lift up that arm rest. 
[02:05:00]  That seat doesn't look as comfy.  No, not like the other ones.  Hey, just a little more info  on Green Day coming in.  Yeah.  I guess Green Day was told  they got 45 minutes  and in the middle of their performance,  that fucking clock went from  whatever it was down to one minute.  One minute.  So he's sitting there going,  okay, I'm going to have time  to play a new song  from our album  that comes out, what?  Right.  Tomorrow or whatever.  And then all of a sudden  they went, nope,  and knocked it down in one minute.  Like, get the fuck off the stage. 
[02:05:30]  Wow.  I understand why they're pissed.  And that's why he lost his fucking mind  because he didn't realize.  It wasn't like he mistimed it  in his own head.  They fucked with him  during the actual live performance.  Because you're doing this,  you want to do a new song  to promote your record.  Of course.  Yeah.  It comes out, what, today?  Tomorrow?  Tomorrow.  They're putting out three albums, I think.  I didn't know this  until Travis told me this morning.  Uno, Dos, and Trace.  That's one song,  one of their new songs  is really weird.  Yeah?  They were just in here. 
[02:06:00]  I heard they were all right.  They had that song.  Billy Joe didn't look  all drunk and shit.  No.  You know the problem  with the world today?  There's not enough  of love to go around.  So, is it this great?  That's your song?  Wow.  Is that your song?  Try it once.  No.  I can't.  You know the problem  with the world today?  There's not enough  of love to go around.  This is going great. 
[02:06:30]  It's hideous.  It's hideous.  It's so hokey.  Is that the hook officially?  I don't know what it is.  All I know is  I was trying to fucking,  I was heating up food  and I couldn't stop it.  That goes on your head.  I hate it.  But you can't stop yourself. 
[02:07:00]  It invaded me.  I didn't think it was good.  It just snuck in there.  Terrible.  It was like a fucking,  a stepfather  in the middle of the night.  Just crept in.  It's great.  You want to do it though?  No.  You know the problem  with the world today?  There's not enough  of love to go around.  And you gotta go,  fell with the world today.  And you also gotta go,  ain't no the problem.  That's how you started.  Oh, I hate it.  Wow.  Is there not enough love  to go around? 
[02:07:30]  It was such a trite, awful.  Oh, it is.  Awful.  Yeah, you know,  we need more love.  That's the problem  with the world today.  Oh, is that horrid?  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy.  It wouldn't go away.  Terrible.  And for many people,  it won't now.  No, let's hope not.  Gotta make a promo out of that.  Oh, it's terrible.  All right.  Can we finally talk  about iPhones next?  Yeah, and the fact that  me, I, myself,  huge Apple fanboy, 
[02:08:00]  as I've been called,  has not gotten it yet.  You gonna explain why next?  A tease?  Satellite radio?  Let's do this.  Holy shit.  You're gonna explain next?  I'll explain after  these words.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Thanks for calling  the Opie and Anthony  F-U line.  Here's the latest batch  of F-Ears.  Fuck you!  Yeah, I want to say  fuck you to Anthony  for making me want to watch  that fucking disgusting 
[02:08:30]  funny booboo bullshit.  Your whole family's  an embarrassed man to America.  Thanks a lot, Anthony.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  This fuck you  goes to my  still in the VX life  just because she called me  to jack it off  to a bitch of her sister.  I mean, come on.  You guys are fucking twins.  Fuck you.  Fuck you!  I have the hugest  fuck you  to that drunken  hyena motherfucker  Roland.  Shut up,  your stupid laugh,  you dumb motherfucker.  Fuck you, Roland. 
[02:09:00]  You suck!  Fuck you!  I want to say  fuck you  to the asshole  across the street  that thought it was  a good idea  to start mowing her lawn  at 7.15 on a Sunday.  Doesn't this douche-noz  will understand  I'm trying to be hungover?  Don't fuck yourself,  coots,  and there's gonna be  dog shit in your mailbox.  Fuck you!  I wanted to say  fuck you  to the stripper in Charlotte  who started menstruating  while she was giving me  a lap dance.  Fuck you,  you wouldn't even  give me a refund. 
[02:09:30]  Fuck you!  Hey, boss,  don't fuck yourself.  We're tired of hearing  about your goddamn  documentary movie.  Just shut the fuck up.  You can't even speak right,  you dumbass.  Fuck you!  Hi, I'm Sam!  I wanted to give  this fuck you  to myself!  Ah!  Fuck you!  Yeah, this nephew  goes out to a douche bag  in front of me  at my local convenience store  that buys his cigarette  and his lottery tickets  with a fucking check. 
[02:10:00]  You white trash piece of shit,  get a debit card.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Don't leave the cheese  hanging halfway  off the burger.  Put it in the middle.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  I like to give a big  fuck you  to all a piece of garbage.  Take us out,  chip-hated.  I destroy those  cock-fuckers.  Take us out,  that's over.  Fuck you!  Call the O.P. and Anthony  F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1. 
[02:10:30]  2XM.  3XM.  The O.P. and Anthony  Show.  Let's talk iPhones.  Please.  Because Jimmy's fucking singing  his dumbass fucking song.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm not alone, by the way.  Guess who approached me  in the hallway  with song in his heart?  Who?  Oh, Sam Roberts.  Of course, Sam.  Couldn't get it out of your head.  Just trying to bond, are you?  Dee-dee-dee-dee.  Was it there? 
[02:11:00]  What the fuck  do you do with this?  At first, you dip it in lard.  That is...  Oh, fuck it.  I'm all about having  a banana every once in a while,  but when it looks like  a huge donger,  I can't eat it.  It really is a cock-like banana.  What the fuck, man?  G.H., that's love.  Oh, thank you, Kenny.  I got that special for you.  Can I see that for a second?  It's not bent.  Yeah, I don't need it.  It's not bent,  and it's very big. 
[02:11:30]  Jimmy,  he's putting it by his wee-wee  and flopping it around  and making that retort sound.  It's exactly what you should do  with a big, straight banana.  Jim, I got one for you, too,  if you want it.  I would like that.  That's a big...  Do you want it back?  I was talking about it.  No, I...  It's not even...  Let me see...  Hold on.  Hold on a second.  Yeah, hello.  Ah, banana phone.  All right, maybe I can break it in half.  Hopefully no one will notice.  That's a big, straight,  fucking dick-like nanner. 
[02:12:00]  It's just...  It's too...  It's like a little curve.  You see what I did with it?  It's uncut.  And it's too big.  It is big.  Just shove it in your face.  And bananas are supposed to bend a little bit,  then that makes you feel like,  okay, you're not holding a cock.  Yeah.  You're holding a cock.  So it could hit your prostate.  It needs a little bend.  I thought of you when I picked that one.  Thank you.  Oh, God, Kenny.  By the way, Vince A,  who's one of my regulars there on the Twitter,  he got the fucking Dine-In Theater's picture immediately. 
[02:12:30]  The Cinema Suites, Sam.  Okay.  And here it is.  Oh, there it is.  Nice, right?  With the trays and the fucking...  Comfy chairs.  How many people at the table?  It doesn't...  I was trying to see.  It looks like they're two-seaters.  Can I see it?  Yeah, and you have to be 21 or older  to go in the Cinema Suite  because you can get booze.  Oh, fuck that.  You get booze, too?  Yeah.  No, don't serve booze in movies.  Yeah, you get booze in food,  waitress service.  Oh, that's good.  But I don't know, like, how many people, 
[02:13:00]  like, if you got privacy  or how many people are in the suite.  Two.  It looks like just two,  and then you're sitting next to a bunch of other dummies.  Don't do it, Jimmy.  I'm about to say.  You're snapping your fingers.  Oh, God.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  It'll make you feel better.  No?  You know the problem with the world today?  There's not enough love to go around.  It's almost having a Paul Williams sound to it.  It sounds like Aerosmith.  Yeah, Aerosmith, too, yeah.  Something wrong with the world today. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, my God, yeah.  Oh, is that a song by them?  Yeah.  Oh, something wrong with the world today.  Oh, maybe that's where I got it.  The only thing wrong with the world today.  Wow, a lot of people saying  it sounds like living on the edge.  Oh, okay.  Maybe that's where I heard it.  You know what?  That might be where I heard it.  Fucking Jimmy's starting to rip off other songs now.  But no, I'm relieved that I heard that somewhere.  It's not like your Nichols song.  No, because this is...  That's not my Nichols song.  Say, hey, what do you say?  Give me a Nichol.  Why the shimmy?  You shimmy up to the mic. 
[02:14:00]  You know, Paul jumps up two feet  because he's trying to make the kids laugh.  He goes, say, hey, what do you say?  Give me a Nichol.  And they chuckle.  The kids laugh.  He fucks their throats.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  iPhone's.  Oh, yes.  Apple's iPhone.  I guess they sold $10 million over the weekend.  And I want to say this.  I said on Friday that you could walk right into a fucking iPhone store  and buy it within a day.  And a lot of people tweeted me and said just that.  They went to Walt Whitman Mall, walked in, 
[02:14:30]  and walked out with an iPhone 5.  That's how it works.  I told you.  So I don't know why these idiots were online for two or three days.  By the way, people,  Apple stock down $15 in pre-market trading.  After selling $10 million iPhone 5s over the weekend?  Yes, $15 down in pre-market.  If this downturn does go into today's trading,  I would buy on this dip, people.  Just my humble opinion.  Are you going to be buying during the show?  I think I might be buying back into Apple during the show.  When the market opens.  If this dip continues during the day. 
[02:15:00]  Are we talking about puts?  No, I'm going to buy some calls.  Some calls?  I'm going to buy some calls.  If I bought some puts Friday, I'd be in very good shape.  But I didn't.  That's why.  But I didn't.  Apple sells $5 million below most estimates.  Yep.  But they sold $10 million.  No, it was reported that they could.  Yep.  So how many did they sell?  Apparently $5 million.  And they were supposed to sell $10 million?  Yep.  And they're taking a hit.  They're taking a hit because of it.  Samsung!  That's why there was no lines. 
[02:15:30]  Samsung!  Let me tell you something.  Galaxy S3.  Let me tell you something, though.  I am a prime example of what happened.  And I wasn't very excited about this, so I didn't need it right away.  But I will buy it.  They will hit their numbers.  Oh, yeah.  It's just not going to be as fast as this frenzy that we're used to with Apple.  This is where Apple has hurt themselves.  Oh.  Because I think the same way as Anthony.  I went online to look at it.  Four-week delivery.  Go fuck yourselves.  Yes.  I'm not waiting a month. 
[02:16:00]  I just...  I'm an impulse guy.  So it's like they have made it like this amazing...  They want such a frenzy around it that a lot of people are just like, you know what?  Fuck it.  I'm fine with what I got.  And it's all fake.  They have plenty of iPhones for everybody.  But they think if they had this quote, we sold out, it makes it that more important to people.  Yeah, but that's annoying.  But in this day and age, people don't fucking buy into that anymore.  Because by now...  You're on your shit right now.  And you're on your third phone.  By now, most people are on their third iPhone.  And you're like, I'm not spending...  It's amazing how many people are fucking cunts on Twitter. 
[02:16:30]  People are like, why shouldn't you have to pay $850?  I was complaining that it's $850 because my contract is not up.  But I didn't say that I, Jim Norton, shouldn't have to pay it and you should.  I was just complaining that it's expensive.  Right.  So you cunts out there, just fucking die.  You want to jailbreak some shit or what?  Wonderful people.  Let's do some jailbreaking.  Jailbreaking.  I got a guy.  I wrote you on Twitter.  I don't like jailbreaking.  I got a guy. 
[02:17:00]  But I don't want to have to fucking pay $850 for that.  That's a lot.  I got a guy.  I bet you I could save you...  I think I could save you $200.  The contracts are disgusting.  Well, yeah, that's the thing.  You get a subsidized price because you sign on to a two-year deal.  So that's like any phone.  Four weeks delivery.  That's stupid on Apple's part.  Terrible.  Hey, did you guys see the Samsung commercial they ran during the football games?  I did not.  I don't know how true this shit is, but they're pretty fucking smart with their advertising,  making fun of the iPhone 5. 
[02:17:30]  Here is the commercial.  The setup is easy.  Everyone's just online, I guess, in Chicago, waiting for their iPhone.  That's it.  Waiting for the store to open so they can buy their iPhone.  And this is how Samsung handled the whole thing.  It's a brilliant commercial, I think.  This phone's going to be like a precious jewel.  Ooh, I love that.  The headphone jack is going to be on the bottom.  I heard the connector is all digital.  What?  What does that even mean? 
[02:18:00]  Who knows?  I'm psyched.  All I'm saying is that they should have a priority line for people who've waited five times.  Heard you have to have an adapter to use the dock on the new one.  Yeah, yeah, but they make the coolest adapters.  Welcome back.  Guess that Galaxy S3 didn't work out.  No, I love the GS3.  It's extremely awesome.  Pause is a setup.  Okay, so everyone knows it's all fanboys waiting for their iPhone 5s.  And then this guy's on.  Damone is sitting there online.  Online with his Samsung 3, his Galaxy S3. 
[02:18:30]  And the guy just assumed, oh, see, I told you that.  It's a shitty phone.  Welcome back.  You're going to go back to the iPhone.  Okay.  Just go back a little bit.  It doesn't say iPhone.  It's really smart, this commercial.  Right.  Yeah, they never say it.  No, I love the GS3.  It's extremely awesome.  I'm just saving a spot in line for someone.  That's not cool.  Yeah, man.  This year, we're finally getting everything that we didn't get last year.  The big screen.  True 4G.  Yeah.  What is that?  Hey, what'd you just do?  Oh, I just sent him a playlist. 
[02:19:00]  By touching phones?  Yeah.  Simple as that.  That's the Samsung guy.  It's the Galaxy S3.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, Mom, Dad.  Oh, thanks for holding our spot.  Oh, boy.  Hey, man.  Oh, hey.  How's it going?  Saved you a spot.  I moved on.  But you're not going to miss all this?  Nah, I got the Samsung GS3 now.  Is that a Samsung?  That's a new Samsung.  It is.  It's pretty cool.  But I kind of like it.  This one's 4G.  Yeah.  We've had that for a while. 
[02:19:30]  This one's got a big screen.  This one has a bigger one.  And we can share videos instantly.  You can watch a video while you're sending an email.  But we're going to get that.  For sure.  Or maybe not this time, but the next time.  Right?  Oh, boy.  The Samsung Galaxy S3.  Good.  You know what?  Hey, man.  It's well done.  It's well done.  And they're smashing the fucking way.  12 million views on that video.  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, you know, there's a real phone that is finally competing with the iPhone.  This is why BlackBerry, whoever runs BlackBerry, should just be fucking never allowed to have a job again. 
[02:20:00]  BlackBerry had such a lead.  They should have been the ones in that commercial.  But Samsung Galaxy S3.  Do you have a Galaxy?  Yeah.  Oh, that's what you...  This is my third one.  The first one was a little shaky.  I'm not going to lie to you.  When you guys were making fun of me, I didn't have a leg to stand on because it was kind of shitty.  The second one was good.  The third one is amazing.  I'm debating what we can do.  I'm happy with the Galaxy S3.  Oh, boy.  What would happen if I went from this iPhone to that, like with the contract transfer or no? 
[02:20:30]  Oh, boy.  I got a guy, though.  What?  I got a guy.  Well, you have AT&T.  Are they on Verizon, too?  I don't know.  I don't know how that all works, to be honest with you.  I got AT&T, yeah.  Well, I refuse to do AT&T again.  I love my Samsung Galaxy S3, for real.  And that's a really smart commercial.  Really smart.  Yeah.  There's a war going on between these two companies now.  It's nasty.  Google and Apple are fucking fighting it out.  Good, though.  And it's getting nasty.  And guess who's going to lose a little bit in their battle? 
[02:21:00]  Who?  Us.  They're taking away dumb little things already that were very convenient for both sides.  But it's going to force them both.  I like a little healthy competition.  It's going to force iPhone to stop fucking playing games like that.  Right.  Because Galaxy is actually...  Isn't that a bigger smartphone?  It's a little...  Oh, yeah.  It's wider.  It's wider.  No, no, no.  I mean, we'll buy more people.  They sold more, like, last month for the first time.  And that was news.  But they didn't credit the fact that nobody was buying iPhones because they knew...  Sure.  That the new one was coming out. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, you're not going to buy a fucking phone.  The new one is obviously a very good product as well.  Sure.  You've got two really good phones now with these two monster companies.  They took your maps away because they're being assholes toward each other.  They gave us new maps.  And replaced it with a shittier version, obviously.  That's what I'm getting at.  Suzanne Somers is on the news.  Sorry.  She still looks good.  Yeah.  She's one that didn't do too much face work.  Does she?  She's bundled up.  She's got to be 60-something.  Yeah.  I'd still fuck her, man.  Maybe older.  Nice legs.  Oh, God.  She's showing her legs and everything. 
[02:22:00]  I remember going to the taping of The Daily Show when that asshole was the host and she...  Killborn?  Yeah.  Craig Killborn.  I go way back.  And she was a guest back then.  I brought my brothers.  We were howling.  Her ass is so ridiculously flat...  Flat ass.  Flat ass.  ...that we started openly laughing when she walked onto the set.  Oh, really?  I don't know why it's so flat, but it's horrendously flat.  Ew.  And that's all I remember from the taping. 
[02:22:30]  How bad her ass is.  Just how flat Suzanne Somers' ass is.  I couldn't tell you anything else that happened that day.  Hey, what are maps like now on iPhone?  They're not good.  It's not good, Jimmy.  This is my...  No, this is the...  I have the 4G or the 4S, whatever.  Oh, that's Google Maps.  You haven't upgraded...  They got rid of Google Maps.  Yeah, because they're fighting with Google.  They said, fuck you.  And they got rid of Google Maps.  And they also got rid of the YouTube that used to come with the phones.  So can you download a YouTube app?  Yeah, you just go into the app store.  Wait, is this Google Maps that I have?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you're not going to have that with the iPhone 5.  You haven't upgraded to iOS 6, which takes Google Maps off and then puts... 
[02:23:00]  But no, no, no.  But what's so great about the map I have here?  It's just an aerial view.  Because it's Google Maps.  Because they have over 7,000 people working on their maps department alone.  And Apple only has like a couple hundred working on theirs.  Let me see your map.  No one would argue that...  Go ahead.  I mean, Google Maps is really, really good.  Google has invested millions and millions and millions of dollars...  Many, many, many, many years.  ...into their thing.  And this is brand new.  But this is where the consumer gets fucked because those two are battling.  They said, fuck you. 
[02:23:30]  And they took the Google Maps off the new iPhone.  Go to where we are now.  I want to show you where we are now.  And they also took the YouTube thing and made it an extra step for you to get it on your phone.  Like, there's some cool stuff.  There's 3D.  There's flyover.  Ooh.  But there's no street view because Google Street View is Google Street View.  Do we have Street View on this iPhone?  Of course you do.  No, I don't.  Yes, you do.  Hold on a second.  You're humiliating me.  Wait a minute.  Stop embarrassing me.  Hold on, Opie.  I'm frightened.  Are you panicking?  Where's Street View?  Show me Street View.  Show me Street View.  You should know Street View by now.  It's right there.  Satellite list. 
[02:24:00]  Where?  I'm sorry.  Well, you have to drop a pin somewhere.  How about you drop a pin?  Yeah, why don't you drop a bunch of pins up your asshole?  Sorry, Travis.  Are we talking about Pinterest now?  Pinterest?  How can you move the pin?  Pinterest.  How do you move the pin?  Touch the pin.  Why do you move a pin?  Leave it there.  Why are you yelling?  I don't know.  How do I move it?  Stop.  This pin sucks.  What are you doing?  How does he not know he had fucking Street View?  You got the Street View for him?  Holy shit.  Come on, Jimmy.  You didn't know you had that? 
[02:24:30]  Look at his face.  No.  Isn't that amazing?  Holy mackerel.  Now, when you...  Oh my God, you can go in circles.  I never knew this.  I've been looking at the one view on maps like this eats my fucking dick.  Well, now, when you upgrade, you won't have that anymore.  Sometimes when I'm bored, I just drive down New York streets for a little while on my  phone.  This is so cool.  Is Google Maps going to be an option?  They've already submitted the app, so assuming Apple approves it, which they probably will.  They could say no, though.  They could say...  Yeah, but then they'd have outrage. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, but they're not going to approve it right away.  They're going to slow the process down, I bet you.  Oh, this is so cool!  So you have to drop a pin first?  But you're losing that if you get your iPhone 5.  Or, like, if you search something, you know, and the address comes up, and that little  name is colored and not high...  Oh, Travis!  That's what tells you a neighborhood you shouldn't go into?  Yeah.  Are the directions worse?  I don't know.  I haven't used the directions.  I have a GPS.  I didn't know they had this.  Yeah, it's amazing.  It's got turn-by-turn directions now, though.  How did you not know that, Jimmy?  Opie, I don't know.  Now, if I want to drop another... 
[02:25:30]  How do I move my fucking pin?  It won't move!  Oh my God, hold it!  I'm holding it!  Look!  Hold on, cocksucker!  Drop pin!  Hold pin!  This would be...  He got so angry.  This would be the greatest video.  Oh, he got so angry.  I'm moving the pin.  Let's see the guy.  Oh, this is the greatest thing I've ever seen.  Well, you're going to lose it if you get...  No, I'm not.  It's gone.  Can I ask you guys something?  Wow.  Does Samsung have this?  You can look up in the air, too!  Look at this!  Holy shit!  Hey, hope Apple stopped allowing Google Maps to upgrade a few years ago, and now the 
[02:26:00]  new Maps is way better.  Is that true?  What new Maps?  On Apple?  No.  No one likes the new Maps.  You want a lot of Google Maps.  No, but you weren't allowed to upgrade Google Maps for a few years now.  Is that true?  You guys are iPhone guys.  Maybe?  I don't know.  Is that on Google Maps?  Okay.  No, this is new Apple Maps.  Well, why do you need to see that?  That's great if you have a fucking helicopter.  Like, well, it's cool.  It's great if you're driving a Chinook.  That's the thing.  It's a nice novelty.  Like, I can, you know, do this, and it's 3D, and it's fun.  It's like Siri. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Get a Samsung for your other phone just to try it out.  I know.  Because then you would be the ultimate.  You got two.  Oh, I know.  I know.  Because I don't know iPhone enough to say this is a better phone.  I just like this phone.  It's all I know, though.  I know a few people with that phone, and I'm very impressed by it.  I really do love it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I am.  They have a good Google Map on Opie's phone.  Don't touch my phone!  Holy shit.  Dude, let me see.  Hold on.  Let's do this.  Let's do a little comparing.  This is where the couple of men get together and do some comparing. 
[02:27:00]  Nice.  I have to turn on my location services.  Okay.  So go into settings.  I know how to do it.  I didn't know the fucking map thing.  I didn't know the fucking map thing.  Wait, I want to Google Map now.  What can I map?  Hold on a second.  Let me map.  Let's just do right here.  It's on.  My location service is up.  So what I want to do is I want to compare.  My phone to Travis and Opie.  Oh, this is good.  Because Travis has the new iPhone.  Me and Opie both have Google.  Opie and I both have Google Maps.  Google. 
[02:27:30]  But you may have a more updated one than I do.  Google.  All right, where are we going?  I don't know.  How do I fucking location?  Okay.  I did already.  Oh, cocksucker.  Where are we searching for?  Let's put an address in.  What's the address here?  You don't need to.  Just hit the little arrow and it will take you to where you are now.  Ah, I see.  Does your phone do that?  No, because that feature is turned off on my phone.  What are you, mobster?  All right, let me see.  Don't want no one knowing where you are.  They might.  Let me see.  Now, why is this man not lit?  There he is. 
[02:28:00]  Okay, let's just take a look.  See around.  Where are we going to where we are right now?  I don't understand what you want me to do.  Oh, you figure.  So, you turn on location services and then get where we are right now.  Okay.  What's the street view?  My current location is temporarily unavailable.  Oh, it's because AT&T is terrible.  All right, I'm the one that has.  So, this is basically street view for Apple.  This is.  That's it?  Well, you can go like that.  And he's got the new iPhone 5.  Zoom in. 
[02:28:30]  And then I can go like this.  How close?  What's the address here so I can play along?  Seriously.  So, basically, they're doing it all from satellite shots.  Well, yeah, because Google has mapped it for real.  Google has mapped it with cars and trucks and planes for years.  But why would Apple do that?  Like, that's where that territorial shit makes them suck.  And that's what hurt them years ago.  Yes, that's true.  Yeah.  All that proprietary shit.  That proprietary shit is what gave Windows 80% of the world's computers.  And then now they're making this amazing resurgence. 
[02:29:00]  And they still insist.  Until you.  How about this?  Because you make sure your fucking map is as good.  I didn't even know I had this until two seconds ago, so.  Yeah, you didn't.  Now it's making all the difference in the world to Jim.  How valuable is it?  Yeah, that's the thing.  Like, with Apple Maps, it's a very good idea.  And there's some really awesome things in it.  But it's nowhere near ready to be on a phone.  Here's my street view of a.  He'll have the same street view as you do, Jim.  Jimmy's like the woman that Sam interviewed.  Look, I can just move mine around.  He didn't even know what's on his phone. 
[02:29:30]  Huh?  I'm going to text.  You can go up in the sky.  Send messages.  You can send pictures.  I mean, pictures.  Look how beautiful that is.  That's the same as mine.  And then you go, whop.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, because it's pulling off the same information.  No, but you were saying that his.  Look how clear that picture is.  That's great.  That's amazing.  Okay.  Well, that's pretty cool.  I didn't know I had that feature.  I don't like it.  Show me.  Sorry.  Anyway, you were saying, so you didn't get the iPhone 5.  Why?  Well, because I didn't have that excitement factor.  Why? 
[02:30:00]  I don't know.  They had a few new features.  Eh.  Nothing.  Nothing that made you go, holy fuck.  That was like, I need that.  Yeah.  It wasn't an I need that right now kind of a thing.  Yeah.  So I figured, fuck it.  Wait a couple days and get it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I'm not going to wait online.  I'm not.  And I have contacts.  Like, I could have, but I didn't even want to have to go through the crowd.  I think you guys all sort of said it.  I think iPhone 5 kind of got caught this time around. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Because Samsung S3 has a lot of these features.  Yes.  And Apple was the only fucking game in town, but now they can't fuck around with that bullshit anymore.  There's someone else.  Right?  Google is such a big company.  I guess that will be good for the consumer.  Yeah.  I just don't like how they just, you know, took your maps away from you just because they're having an issue with Google.  But if they have it as an app that gets approved and it's the same thing.  If they get the proof, then that's great.  But right now?  But it'll be the same thing.  I know.  Plus they added free turn by turn.  What is that? 
[02:31:00]  It's like GPS.  Directions.  Who added that?  Apple did.  Apple.  You didn't have that?  Oh, boy.  Not for free.  Does Google have it?  What do you mean not for free?  I had it for free.  This is the commercial.  Right here.  No, Google Maps never had it.  I had it for free.  The turn by turn.  I never paid for that shit.  You have turn by turn right now?  You could just go like, make a right.  What do you mean make a right?  Like a GPS.  Talk to you.  Does it talk to you?  Oh, I don't know if I have that.  Turn by turn directions.  I don't know if I have that.  I'm not going to lie.  I have no idea.  I would read it. 
[02:31:30]  I would read it.  No, that's not enough to go around.  That's just listing the turns that you're going to make.  Yeah, that's turn by turn.  Someone's saying you do have it.  Oh, I just don't know.  Oh, my God.  Because I got a GPS in my car, so I haven't used my phone.  Everyone is that woman that Sam interviewed.  Everyone's Rachel.  Look at this.  You hit the buttons, and all of a sudden, the fucking old person answers.  Jim is marveling over features that don't exist on the phone anymore.  I was talking to Steve Noir address, and we don't.  He just texted me the address of this one. 
[02:32:00]  Dr. Steve Noir.  He sends his stuff here.  He's a creep.  He really is a creepy guy.  All of a sudden, I get dick pictures in the mail.  I'm like, who's are these?  I see a stethoscope next to them.  I'm like, uh-huh.  Yeah, I'm very tumescent.  You want an explanation for why Apple Maps this guy just writes?  Yes, please.  Let's hear this bullshit.  The new Apple Maps doesn't come with a public transportation option?  No, it doesn't.  That's the other thing that I really hate about.  They're crazy.  Yeah, that's what really, like, for someone like me, that sucks.  Because there's no public transportation. 
[02:32:30]  Dude, when you're in a weird part of Manhattan, you go, okay, where the fuck is the nearest  subway and Google Maps?  Where's public transportation?  Hopstop.  They don't have the subways and the bus stations and all that.  You're doing directions.  But you can see what they don't have in stunning 3D.  So if you go to, like, current location and then, like...  Oh, my God.  That's got to piss off a lot of people in the big cities.  How do you not have that?  I don't know.  You're like, all right, where's the nearest subway?  It does seem like something they should have.  You're right.  You can just download Hopstop.  Jesus.  Because know what they did? 
[02:33:00]  They have the problem with the Google, but they weren't ready to put out their own version.  But they said, fuck our customers.  Yeah.  We're going to put it out anyway because we don't want their maps on our phones anymore.  Or in iOS 7, they'll be like, look at the new maps.  And now we have subway directions.  Exactly.  And now we have...  Oh, boy.  Well, it's taken its toll.  Maps is very good.  Apple down $17.50 pre-market.  It doesn't exist anymore.  $682.  I just showed them public transportation.  Wow.  Then just remember, when it tells you you have a software upgrade available, don't do it. 
[02:33:30]  We'll let them talk over there.  We'll talk stocks.  We'll talk stocks over here.  This is amazing.  It always does.  He tells you what train to take?  I have a fucking separate app for that.  Yeah, but you're not going to have that with the new phone.  That's bullshit.  I'm not getting the new phone.  I'm debating the Samsung, actually.  Yeah, but then if you get it and you hate it, then you're going to hate me.  I'd like to watch that.  So I'm not going to hate you for the Samsung.  I think you might.  I think you might.  No.  He probably will.  I'll just bring it back.  I've been around long enough to know.  He might go...  It's like, oh, could you see it?  It's like, I got the Samsung. 
[02:34:00]  I got tried.  It stinks.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm going to have to look down awkwardly because I know I was the one that turned you  on to it.  No, but Ant did, too, because he said he had some people.  It's like, I've heard from enough different sources.  A lot of cool shit on there.  I really...  You know, in the past, I had to kind of fake it because you guys are all iPhone fanboys,  but finally, I feel like I could kind of show off a phone for the first time.  I don't know.  You've gone through a multitude of shitty phones.  Without a doubt.  I can't even defend that.  I stayed in BlackBerry way too long.  Oh, the BlackBerry. 
[02:34:30]  Because I was convinced they were going to figure it out because they had such a lead.  And then I said, fuck it.  And then my buddy Buzzy down there in Atlanta came up to visit and we went out to dinner  and he had that first Samsung Android phone or whatever.  And I got it.  I was like, oh, man.  I was kind of bummed at first because it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be.  But then the second one, they figured it out.  Did you like the clicky buttons on the BlackBerry?  This is why BlackBerry should be firebombed. 
[02:35:00]  Because I bought it.  AT&T was so bad and scumbag Apple went with them that that was the chance for BlackBerry  to make their move because they had Verizon.  And I was willing to walk away from the iPhone for Verizon because I had so many calls dropped.  I was like, this piece of shit service.  But these dummies, these fucking dummies at BlackBerry thought that people needed that feeling tactile. 
[02:35:30]  Tactile.  A clickety-clickety-clack.  It was like the Billie Jean video.  A clickety-clickety-clackety-clickety-clickety.  And I fucking hated it.  But with people with OCD, it was just, it was nice.  Oh.  But it wasn't, though, because you couldn't go fairly.  You couldn't go quickly.  They blew it.  They simply blew it because they're a dogshit company.  They're a fucking dogshit operation.  And they deserve to be drummed out of business.  Drummed out of the regiment.  Fuck them.  I hate them.  I don't know how to, I don't know what the proper terminology is for this one, but can 
[02:36:00]  you guys, like, drag and write your text messages?  No.  No.  What?  Let's say I'm writing you.  So I just go, I put my finger on the A, and then I drag it to the N. And then from there  I drag it to the T and drag it to the H. And it just knows what I'm doing.  Yeah, that's a feature that they have.  I think eventually I'm going to really like it.  Because it's so, like, no one's used to doing that, so it's a little weird, because you  always want to lift your finger up, but as long as you keep your finger down and go around. 
[02:36:30]  What if there's a word with two G's in the middle?  Wow, you know what?  You know what?  How often does that come up, though?  A lot.  You know what?  My answer would be, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Has your phone just stopped trying to correct it, like, just months ago?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm sure somebody is going to answer that question in a second.  Of course.  And some asshole's saying, I had a Razor.  I never had a Razor.  You didn't have the Razor?  I never had a Razor.  We had Razor Rollerboard scooters. 
[02:37:00]  Never had the phone, though.  Yeah, but Razors were really cool, so, like, if you had a Razor, you had a Pebble.  I had the Black Razor.  The Pebble looked like the phone, like it should have been a big pile of those phones in a glass  bowl in a bathroom.  Yes, or on your chest.  On Chuck Berry's chest.  I do have audio turn-by-turn, but I haven't used my phone that way yet.  I don't even know half the shit still.  Dude, I can't believe I didn't know that map feature.  I didn't know you could do that on your fucking phone. 
[02:37:30]  I love Street View.  I never used it.  Yeah, Street View's great, especially for, like, a place you've never been to, and you're  like, all right, well, let me see, you know, what the awning looks like.  Oh, don't tell me why.  I lived in ten different places in Geneseo alone, then four places in Rochester, two in Buffalo,  so one day I'm just like, I want to go, I just want to Street View all the places I  used to live in.  It was fucking fun, man.  Can you have a favorite Street View place?  I didn't know word-by-word directions.  That's fucking awesome.  You're hysterical, Jimmy.  I swear to God, I never, all I do is text with it and fucking go to my chess app.  Here's a picture of my cock, madam. 
[02:38:00]  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, boy.  Google Maps, we are all, let me tell you something.  Favorite Street View.  Here's what people are on our way to doing.  I know, it's just the best.  We're on our way.  When you have a favorite Street, you know what?  Yeah.  Just to fucking-  We have to pause and appreciate that.  What place do you like to look at the most?  Yeah.  Who wants their favorite Street View?  You are the best, Jimmy.  No, but I mean, like, say a location that you go to a lot.  Yeah.  Do you have, like, a favorites?  A favorites for Street View.  Yeah.  Well, why don't you just go there and take a picture of it, and then-  No, no, no.  I mean, like, yeah, you say-  But you made it sound like there's no- 
[02:38:30]  Take a picture.  It lasts longer.  You made it sound like there's no-  Why don't you marry it?  You made it sound like there's no reason to actually go there.  Or it's just your favorite Street.  Your favorite Street.  Maybe a street in Paris.  You wait until the next thing, though, is that we will all be able to see Street View instantly.  That's the next thing coming.  I mean, maybe not the next thing, but that might happen in our lifetime, where everybody  is going to have access to everything.  That's why I'm told-  We've talked about privacy.  Privacy will be seen as a thing of the past.  Because you're going- 
[02:39:00]  Look at Street View.  I like Jimmy's views of the future.  They're always so ominous and scary.  No, it's a part of progress.  We are all going to be able to see everything.  We have some doom and gloom music as Jimmy-  Yeah, yeah.  Tell us what's going to happen in the future, Jimmy.  Okay.  Everything will be visible to us at all times.  Because you've noticed it in the last 20 years, before 9-11, even Rodney King, all  these moments are being caught on camera.  Even JFK.  Yes.  All these moments are being caught, being caught, and it's going faster.  It's like Ray Kurzweil talked about. 
[02:39:30]  It's going faster and faster and faster.  And now everything, everything, everything is being documented.  Street View, you can see every street.  You just can't do it in real time.  Fast forward a few years of technology.  Yes.  Everything you can see with Street View, you'll be able to access in real time.  With maybe a one second or zero second delay if it's working at the speed of light.  Where will all those cameras be?  I don't know how it will work.  I don't know how it will work.  Like a view screen on Star Trek, on the Enterprise, where if Kirk was fighting the Gorn, and he's 
[02:40:00]  on the planet, they could watch it on the ship, even though there were no cameras around or  anything.  And it had a director's cut, and there was like a three-camera shoot.  It will absolutely happen.  Maybe every, I don't, because like, you know, Kaku talked in a video about how all walls  will be Wi-Fi.  Like every location will have Wi-Fi, and you'll actually just bring your hard drive with you  and be able to access it.  Of course.  30 years from now.  No.  Sooner.  I'm saying that that was what he was talking about.  Jimmy's saying 30 years open. 
[02:40:30]  I think within five years, you can Wi-Fi your ass off.  I can't buy Christmas.  No, but this is before computers.  This is when there's no more computers.  We won't have a good way off here.  This is what.  Let's just call it 10 years.  Pieces of paper or hard drives.  He's saying that eventually that there'll be so cheap computer chips.  You could fold a hard drive up and put it in your pocket?  Throw it out.  It'll be disposable.  What?  It'll be like, there'll all be computer chips, but that, you could throw them out.  What if somebody's got pornography on there?  There will obviously be a way to figure that out.  We will see everything.  But then the other guys will figure out what you figured out. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, man.  And say, ah, you thought you figured it out, but I figured it out where I could get it back.  Once we learn to communicate our thoughts, like they're working on with Hawkins, where  you can think and text as opposed to touching it.  Because now we're communicating silently.  We're all texting each other.  No one's moving.  It's like fucking what we pictured aliens doing.  Oh, man.  Remove the finger option.  All of a sudden, what you think and you're texting.  Once that technology becomes available, where you can look at something and text it, and  you can read the text, you are then silently communicating.  It's everything we thought space creatures did.  But you have that, what if you have that thing, like sometimes you can't control your mind. 
[02:41:30]  I know.  And you're going to text somebody and just put, hey, fucking cunt.  Don't figure that out.  Go with your point.  My mom would text constantly, did you find my blue comb yet?  Oh, God.  Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.  But that is what will happen.  And that's when we'll start getting penalized for inappropriate thoughts.  That's when.  You won't be penalized because now everyone understands that it's not.  Yeah.  There'll be no more embarrassment anymore.  Yeah.  Exactly.  No one will be embarrassed. 
[02:42:00]  We'll be Vulcans.  We've got to wipe out the embarrassment part of it, or this will never work.  The thought process will change.  We will be penalized for it, because we're already being penalized for everything else.  So we'll be penalized for thinking anti-gay, anti-black, anti-white, anti-woman, any type of thought.  What about Uncle White?  Uncle White is appropriate.  You didn't say the J.  Because you know they give better gifts than Uncle Black will, because Uncle Black doesn't have much money.  What about the anti-J?  Oh, comments.  I'm sure those will always be acceptable in all races.  I don't know about that, because I get kind of scared at that mind thing, because you don't know what's going on. 
[02:42:30]  It's like, do you ever think that your dead relatives are looking into your mind when you jerk off?  No.  And go like, oh boy.  They're on my mind when I jerk off.  So, um, and maybe their ears are ringing so they look.  Fucking Jimmy.  Oh God, me again in that fuck on the table?  Holy shit.  Why do you want to eat my ass?  I was 80 when I died.  Perfect.  Why would they give a fuck your...  Perfect.  Why would they give a fuck you're jerking off when they're just flying around doing whatever the fuck they want? 
[02:43:00]  I don't mind if so much watching me jacking off.  Like, alright, he's jerking off.  Everyone does that.  Of course you don't mind.  Why do you think you fucking drive my schoolyards?  You don't mind.  I don't mind.  But like, if they got into your mind and started looking at your sexual fantasies, oh, that would be terrible.  Because the mind is still mysterious.  We don't know how it works.  It's a terrible thing to waste.  Once we know how it works, it'll be mysterious.  It wouldn't be terrible.  Then you would realize, oh, shit, most people are thinking like I'm thinking.  Yeah.  That's the weird thing.  Absolutely.  You have weird thoughts, and then you just assume no one else has the same weird thoughts as you. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  But if it was all open, you'd be pretty shocked that people you would never think had weird thoughts had weird thoughts.  That's where privacy is a thing in the past.  I truly believe that.  Oh, God.  Imagine being able to just know what people are thinking because they're all online now.  Your mind is online.  Individuality and privacy will be seen someday as primitive qualities.  I don't like Jimmy's future.  I don't like it.  It's scary.  But that's what they will be.  We must kill him.  We must kill him now.  They'll be seen as primitive qualities. 
[02:44:00]  Hey, a couple things really fast.  I guess Google was the one that started the battle with their maps.  Oh, really?  According to a few people, and that's all we need for something to be a fact in the show,  Google wouldn't let Apple use Google turn-by-turn, so Apple was forced to create their own maps with turn-by-turn.  Oh, wow.  A few people are saying that, so I'm assuming that might be true.  Well, that's from Art Google.  Art Google, that's right.  Art Google.  And somebody can't wait.  He needs to tell Anthony about an amazing navigation app. 
[02:44:30]  Go ahead, Dennis and Baltimore, congratulations on your big win there yesterday.  Against the Patriots.  Yeah, that gave me a heart attack.  What are you, a menace?  Good one, Chip.  Sorry, that was horrible.  You guys were talking about nav units.  We weren't.  Yeah, we're done with that.  Next topic.  Go ahead, sir.  Sorry.  We were talking about Jimmy's vision of the future.  Yes, very frightening. 
[02:45:00]  Very accurate, though.  And why we must now kill him.  I predicted smartphones in fucking, like, 1985 I said that.  Damn.  I'm lying.  Pretty good.  No.  Damn.  I would have stuck with that.  It has voice guidance, and Anthony, I think you'll like this.  It allows you to report red light cameras, cops, traffic, everything else.  What about other things I don't like?  It's a database, letting you know that there's a cop.  It allows you to say if that cop is there or not, so it knows to keep it or not.  What they want to have is, you can't say you're in a black neighborhood or shit. 
[02:45:30]  What they want to have in the neighborhoods, you want to know what neighborhood you're going  into by the voice on your guidance changing?  Yes.  Like, make a left.  Yo, go down two blocks and make a motherfucking right, and then you're like, no, no, I better  continue the other way.  Or just have shuttle, uh, shuttle, subtle, excuse me, shades on the map itself.  Just like a black and yellow.  But subtly, it's just a little dark.  Are you making a right to turn?  Oh, Chinatown.  The yellow's a little darker, yeah.  All right, what's the name of this app? 
[02:46:00]  Waze?  Waze.  W-A-Z-E.  It's on all the devices.  Android, iOS.  Make a left at right, and continue for a half mile, your destination on the map.  Then you go uptown, what happened?  Go straight.  Stay on the 495.  Till you reach the exit, then take a right turn.  I went so down on that app.  Of course. 
[02:46:30]  I want a Chinaman giving me my turn by turn.  Uh, I don't know how I feel about the Note 2.  People's asking, uh, people are asking about the Note 2.  What we think.  Oh, that Note 2?  Is that that huge?  Let me go to Jason Illinois.  Well, the concept, the concept is, uh, you know, fuck having your stupid iPad and your  phone, let's put it all together as one.  Cool.  So you sacrifice, and your phone's a little bigger.  I actually, my cell phone guy, you know, sells a lot of those things.  People really like them.  I saw one.  I hated it.  I put it in my back pocket.  It does fit in your back pocket. 
[02:47:00]  And then when you want to say that?  It really does.  It's big.  It's got a stylus.  It's got a stylus, right?  That's always nice.  What if it's going out for the evening and wants to look good?  It has a stylus, but you don't need to use the stylus.  Yeah, anything that comes with the stylus.  That's where the confusion is.  It should not come with it, then.  Let me say hi to Jason in Illinois.  Jason.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Wouldn't you like to know?  You could do just about everything without the stylus, but when you get into some of  the more finer shit that the Note does, that's where you need the stylus.  Yeah.  If you want to draw some cock pictures on the Note app and send them out, you might want 
[02:47:30]  to use the stylus for a little bit more detail.  I guarantee it's not good drawing quality.  Jason, what's up with the Note 2?  Why are you calling?  Well, I just got the Galaxy S3, and I love it.  I came from the Droid Razor, and I like that, too.  But I was at the Verizon store, and they're my carrier, unfortunately, and they don't even  have the fucking Note 2 yet.  They didn't know when it was going to come out two weeks ago.  So they conned me into getting the Galaxy S3, which is fine. 
[02:48:00]  But then two days later, they released a press release saying, like, November 15th, all five  carriers are going to have the Note 2, and it's going to have the Jelly Bean operating  system that has the upgraded quality.  The Jelly Bean operating system?  I have the Louie Bean operating system.  Is that better than ice cream?  Is that better than ice cream?  That's real, by the way.  Oh, I know.  Ice cream and Jelly Bean?  Yeah. 
[02:48:30]  Android's operating system names are just...  It's terrible.  Yeah, they went ice cream, and now it's Jelly Bean.  Snow Leopard?  I don't know.  Well, the Note is absolutely not a bust.  People are fucking buying them, and they're enjoying them.  It looks awful.  It's just a little bigger than...  You'd look so silly putting that up to your head to make a phone call.  Oh, God.  Yeah, it'd be like fucking making a phone call with a window or something.  Ah, that's kind of funny.  I know.  That's why it was a gym chip.  I think initially, if you're a business guy, the Note's a good thing to have when you're  traveling around a lot.  Hold on.  Let me put this giant hot screen to my face. 
[02:49:00]  I'm talking into a microwave.  How are you?  Let me put this in my back pocket.  It's going to break when I sit down.  It's eight pounds.  It's giant.  It's like a book.  I'm holding a Kindle to my face.  You're panicking, sir.  Just pick up the phone.  How stupid do people look when they're holding their iPads up to take a picture?  Terrible.  I see like a Times Square.  They're holding this giant...  It looks like you're shaking a baby.  Aren't you convinced that you're looking at something from 1998?  Yeah.  It's like, oh, look at that.  The phone's just to be so big.  It looks dumb.  There's a whole Tumblr account where it's called, like, you know, you look stupid taking a picture. 
[02:49:30]  I love it.  Of course, there is a Tumblr account for everything.  Wait a minute.  Let me ask you a question.  Is the Android still popular?  Well, Android is an operating system.  Right.  Just like iOS is an operating system.  Does Galaxy use that?  Yes.  But Android could also be in some shit fucking thing that you buy at CBS.  Yeah, I mean, that's the thing.  Like, Android is on, like, you know, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of phones, so...  Well, you can't say hundreds once.  Well, multiple hundreds.  So you can't say, you know, like, oh, Android's better than the iPhone because you're comparing software to an actual phone. 
[02:50:00]  You're basically comparing, like, apples to ovarian tumors.  Horrible examples.  All right, listen, we got a 6 to 1, 2,418,911 to the other.  We want to move on because we got to play the Rachel audio for Jimmy.  But before that, a quick clip of a reporter talking about the new iPhone 5 features.  Oh, God.  Is this something that was out a couple weeks ago? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, this came out a couple weeks ago.  Before the actual phones?  When the reporter got her information from a viral video.  A chick taking a mirror shot of herself with an iPad.  You'll look like an idiot.  It blocks pretty much half your body.  Oh, God, well.  Look at the fucking rump on her.  She's got a big ass, that one.  I like that she's using the iPad to photograph her big fucking thong-eating asshole.  I wish she was wearing a maxi pad when she did it.  What a great Tumblr account.  I would see her period blood.  I got it.  I know. 
[02:51:00]  They look stupid.  All right.  That's funny.  That's also funny.  It just doesn't look natural.  That's funny.  It's like lugging around one of those Ansel Adams fucking cameras.  Sure.  Stupid.  At the Grand Canyon?  Really?  Really.  Then fling it over the edge, you asshole.  Here's what a reporter had to say about the iPhone 5 features before the phones came out.  I've been out here for, since Thursday.  Thursday? 
[02:51:30]  Why?  Well, you know, iPhone 5 is the most amazing, best Apple product ever.  The iPhone 5 doesn't even come out until Friday, but already about a dozen people are camped out in front of Apple's New York flagship store on Fifth Avenue.  Starting at $200, the iPhone 5 is sleeker, has a laser keyboard, holographic images, and other cool new features.  Oh, my God.  What did she say?  They fucking...  This is a joke.  Look at this... 
[02:52:00]  This video's been out for about a year.  This video's been out for a while.  I haven't seen this video.  It's a goof on...  What the iPhone 5's gonna be?  It does.  You put it down, and it projects a laser keyboard on the table.  It's got literally...  It's as thin as paper.  It projects...  It's got a hologram like Star Wars.  This is the actual newscast.  And people think it's real.  Oh, they're actually showing that?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That's why...  Holy fuck.  Can I see this a little bit?  Really, man.  And hear it?  Let me...  Go back to the beginning, you dumb fuck. 
[02:52:30]  I know.  Go back!  You dumb fuck.  Oh, this is Thursday.  Thursday?  Why?  Well, you know, iPhone 5 is the most amazing, best Apple product ever.  The iPhone 5 doesn't even come out until Friday, but already about a dozen people are  camped out in front of Apple's New York flagship store on Fifth Avenue.  Starting at $200, the iPhone 5 is sleeker, has a laser keyboard, holographic images, and  other cool new features.  I'm not sure we lined up for the iPhone 4S for 18. 
[02:53:00]  Shouldn't people just get fired for that?  Yeah, that's terrible.  That's so fucking lovely.  You're the news.  You're supposed to get your shit right.  You know how many people that went through, like, to get approved to go on the air?  Holographic.  And none of them have any idea what the biggest story of that week was what's new on the  iPhone.  Right.  And they didn't know any of it.  First of all, first of all, if that was true, people would be waiting on lines 10 miles long.  Incidentally, that will be coming soon, is the fucking keyboard, yeah.  Oh, more future Jimmy.  I love future Jimmy. 
[02:53:30]  Somebody raised a great point.  Oh.  And I will acknowledge this.  It wasn't you.  No, it was not.  Jim didn't know that his iPhone had a map app, but he knows the future of technology.  Now, I don't claim to be a map genius.  Yes.  But I do understand where we are headed as a species.  And I'm telling you.  Society.  We will eventually see everything as it's happening.  We will know each other's thoughts.  We will know.  It will all become banal, commonplace. 
[02:54:00]  And we will, like, that's why, again, when we think of aliens, they're just kind of these  numb, because we will understand the mind, and I think that even, like, certain things  like sex or humor, humor will be no longer needed, because when you laugh, it's a dopamine  release, or whatever it is.  We will know how to get all these good feelings, so these things that we do to feel good will  eventually go away, which will contribute to more of that sameness.  Oh, no.  I'm telling you. 
[02:54:30]  What about fucking?  I don't want sameness.  Yeah, you do.  Because eventually, we'll have immortality with that.  We'll have 300-year lifespans and traveling everywhere.  I didn't know with all this technology came immortality.  Even though you have to map.  I believe Kurzweil's thing about once we map the fucking mind, you can upload it to a  hard drive.  Kurzweil Schmerswell, you didn't even know about Street View.  Maybe not.  My nickname is not the map kid.  I'm Future Jimmy.  Future Jimmy.  I love Future Jimmy, by the way.  If we had a 300-year lifespan, we would have to do radio for about 100 years. 
[02:55:00]  Wow, that would be fucked up.  That would be really ridiculous.  Imagine what some of the worst of it would sound like.  Oh, my God.  Like fucking covered wagons.  Now, what if we found out...  We're talking about covered wagons now.  What if we found out that your DNA saves every single thing you were?  Nice.  Every single thing you've ever said.  So let's just say we understand, because now they're making 3D printers where you can  print cells, and they're predicting a liver in five years.  Once they start being able to make body parts...  Print a liver. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  That'd be hilarious.  You're out of toner.  You're out of toner for your liver.  We forgot a bile duct.  I know.  Or if you wanted to print your liver, it would be all black, Tony.  Those 3D printers are starting to get really fucking scary, by the way.  Fast forward 50 years or 100 years.  Printing a vagina.  Just a fucking snatch.  You use it once, and then it starts rotting.  Yeah.  It sounds like a stake hitting the floor, and it falls out.  You've got to put, like, a cunt catcher.  It's like vaginas in your freezer. 
[02:56:00]  That'd rule.  Fast forward 100 years, even 200 years.  Say we can mimic anything physical, and we know what DNA is, and we've mapped it.  Why couldn't you take someone's DNA?  And again, say that DNA saves everything.  Why couldn't you just recreate that person from their DNA perfectly with the memories,  with the personality, with the thing that we think is a soul, but has actually been figured  out.  We know what it is DNA-wise.  Maybe that's what eventually the resurrection is supposed to be. 
[02:56:30]  Maybe that's what eventually it is.  Is everybody coming back to life?  We would call ourselves gods.  But I'm saying maybe that's possible.  How dare we?  But break that down now.  Yes.  Break it down.  A lot of comedians have joked about, you know, you die, and then your mom and dad go through  your house, and they find that fucking box of porno, right?  And they realize you were into some weird shit, right?  Yeah.  So now let's do the DNA thing.  You die, and your family's like, oh, we could bring them back to life.  Oh, they look at your DNA.  They start looking at your DNA going, what?  It's just full of, like, the gay code. 
[02:57:00]  It's just full of it.  Your dad's like, oh, boy, I didn't know this.  It flushes your DNA down the toilet.  He goes to play golf.  By that time, there will be no surprises.  Nothing will be shocking, because we'll already be knowing each other's thoughts.  It's not shocking.  Your future.  It really shouldn't be shocking now, because we all pretty much think the same weird shit.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  We really do.  Jesus.  What's Jimmy's future?  You want to have my cock?  No, thank you.  But I'm right, though. 
[02:57:30]  No, you're not.  I am.  No, you're not.  I believe it.  Gee, that's pretty accurate, I guess.  Scary vision.  But we're all going to be on the same wavelength.  But it won't be, after a while, we're just, and again, then, and again, like, like, meet  your cock, we become a planetary force, and that, to me, is how we start to branch out  and really, well, we're all on the same wavelength.  You know what I learned over the weekend?  There was an egghead on TV, and he, what I took from it, he said that the universe was  created using itself.  What? 
[02:58:00]  What does that work?  What do they mean?  I don't know, because then I got really confused, because he's an egghead.  But it didn't need anybody.  It just created itself.  It believed in itself?  It had all it needed, right there, and it just created itself.  Yeah, I don't believe that.  It's a guy that's on a lot, I guess.  They like going to him.  I don't believe that.  He's a true egghead.  Something had to be before it.  Like a good egghead.  You think we're the first humans on this planet?  On this planet, sure.  No fucking way.  Yeah.  No way. 
[02:58:30]  We are.  No way.  I don't believe any society's doing that.  You just gotta dig a little deeper.  Dig a little deeper.  Mm-hmm.  We stopped at the dinosaurs, because we were like, holy fuck, this is pretty amazing.  Yeah.  I say go deeper.  Go deeper.  Oh, yeah.  Into the sediment.  Oh, yeah.  Gonna find, like, fucking...  Oh, yeah.  Some metal.  Mm-hmm.  Imagine.  That'd be fucked up.  Fucking heavy metal.  That's right below the dinosaurs, the tip of a skyscraper.  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  Would that freak people out? 
[02:59:00]  That'd freak everybody out.  That could be a cool movie.  Freak everybody out.  Play the Apes, I guess, sort of did that, though, right?  A little bit, yeah.  Well, why don't we break, and then we'll end the show with Rachel for Jimmy.  Rachel.  We did the whole Rachel thing on Friday, and it turns out, congratulations to Sam, he's  got a massive viral video.  What is it up to now?  Where are you going, Doody boy?  I got a Doody.  $450,000.  Doody McGillicuddy has to run out.  Anthony's stiff-legging.  When we get back, we'll do the Rachel thing to wrap up today, all right?  I can't believe it's 9.30 already. 
[02:59:30]  Let's go smell Anthony's shit.  Oh, boy.  Come on.  He wouldn't be able to shit if he'd just stand there.  Let's the whole show, wait, wait, wait, all right, look.  Now that he's walking, let's all of us go in the bathroom.  Come on, let's all go in and talk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Take us to break before I fucking do something.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM. 
[03:00:00]  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer.  Lars gives a call.  God, this is like 98, something like that, 99 maybe.  And he goes, dude, what are you doing tonight?  I said, I'm playing down the village.  Let's fucking hang out.  I'm going to meet up with some friends.  It's going to be great.  On the way over, we cabbed it, and some kid from NYU left his knapsack 
[03:00:30]  with all his books and notebooks.  And so, you know what?  I'll be a nice guy.  How cool is this be?  Guy from Saturday Live is going to send him back his books.  Well, this is a thorn in Lars's ass.  For the minute I get it.  For the minute I get it, it's like, dude, what are you doing?  The fucking nap?  Get rid of the fuck.  It's ridiculous.  You look like a fag walking around with this fucking knapsack.  So I'm walking around with this thing.  I said, I'm going to give it back.  Why does the knapsack bother you?  It's fucking stupid.  Fuck that guy.  He's irresponsible. 
[03:01:00]  Fuck him.  He'll teach him a lesson.  He tears the knapsack off my back.  I said, what are you doing?  He tosses it across the street, hits some chick in the leg, and it opens up,  and the bags go all over.  And he's walking down the village going like this.  There's your fucking knapsack, huh?  Are we hanging?  Fuck the knapsack, huh?  Huh?  I'm like, Lars, what are you doing?  Chill out.  And he keeps getting in my face.  Are we hanging or what?  I went, I don't know if I can live up to this.  I talk a great game, but I don't know if I can live up to this status. 
[03:01:30]  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  This is the O.P. 
[03:02:00]  So, Jimmy missed Rachel.  Sam brought back what's the hap, excuse me, at the iPhone 5 line.  I'm talking way too fast today.  My tongue is like fucking doing tongue. 
[03:02:30]  You want to help with that?  Nice pair of balls on it.  I'm going to like, I got to ohm for a second.  Ohm.  Got to slow down.  I got a good energy today, but the fucking tongue is like, holy shit.  Nice fucking bag hanging on that tongue.  Slows it right down.  Just fucking, it needs to wait on it.  Sam brought back what's the haps at the iPhone 5 line.  See how easy that is?  Yeah. 
[03:03:00]  Right.  And we met this girl, Rachel, and holy fuck, she's a winner.  And Sam made a separate video of Rachel from the iPhone 5 line, and the thing has exploded.  It's up to almost a half a million views already.  I think Sam has his viral video.  I absolutely believe so.  It finally happened.  That's it.  Hey, you broke your cherry.  Hey.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Because I was one of the original viral video guys.  It's always got to come back to you.  It does. 
[03:03:30]  Kind of noticed that, did you?  I know, right?  Jesus.  Always comes back to me.  Look, I'm just trying to fill four hours.  I know.  We're good.  We're good.  I know.  Today we're good.  It's like, watch what we do.  We're going to make it.  Look at it.  Look at the clock.  I mean my entire career.  I'm just trying to fill four hours at a clip.  But yeah, I do do that a lot, I know.  What was I going to say about this?  There was something else, uh, viral video, blah, blah, blah, eh, whatever.  It'll come up.  Let me see this shit.  Yeah, Jimmy wasn't here for Rachel.  Let me see this shit.  Who is this bitch? 
[03:04:00]  This is the mindset of so many people.  Oh.  This is the mindset of so many people that are getting iPhones, by the way.  And so many people have to just go, fake, fake, so fake, obviously there's actors, fake,  fake, fake, fake, fake.  Yeah.  I've been accused of faking it.  Right.  I've gotten emails, because people find me, they go to the website,  and there's the little contact thing.  So they email me, telling me I'm a bully, and then I should really take the video down,  because I was obviously taking advantage of somebody.  Oh, yeah.  You get that shit, too.  Right.  Because people think I'm a plant from Samsung. 
[03:04:30]  Right.  That Samsung hired me to go down.  Sam?  Samsung?  Huh?  Sam sung a song called, I'm a douche.  Samsung, like a fucking...  Hold on.  Roman had a really good one.  I was going to say hummingbird.  What'd you say?  Bulls.  Come on, just play along.  What would you say?  I said, send the TV.  How do you plug Samsung?  Oh, I feel like the radio wizard now.  Why?  That microphone should just fucking morph into a shotgun. 
[03:05:00]  How ready is that?  And say, are you hungry?  He's tired from Bruce.  Bruce played till two in the morning.  He had to tell everybody.  We're 220, whatever the fuck.  Oh, okay.  Two in the morning.  Two in the morning.  Two in the morning.  Two in the morning.  Two in the morning.  But that was Saturday.  Yeah.  So anyway, we meet Rachel and we're here to tell you, I mean, our audience knows Rachel  is the real deal.  Yeah.  Well, she's just a dope.  She wanted to be interviewed.  And Sam interviewed her and this is what Jimmy missed.  The video is called Waiting for an iPhone.  Ellipses for no reason.  Oh, that's what that is?  I just go dot, dot, dot. 
[03:05:30]  And dot, dot, dot is an ellipses.  And it's always three, right?  Yeah, of course.  It's proper, not four?  No.  No, I put 17.  That's where I do ellipses.  Who decided it had to be three?  Whoever created grammar.  Why can't it be two?  Because there was a fucking three ellipses club and they didn't want a bunch of four ellipses  bums wandering.  Ellipses.  Putting that extra dot everywhere.  All right.  Ellipses teeth.  See you tomorrow.  No.  You wanted to see this.  Let's meet Rachel.  Fucking chip. 
[03:06:00]  We're here on the iPhone 5 line with Rachel.  Rachel, what's the haps?  Well, everybody wants a new version of the iPhone 5.  Was her breath bad?  We're waiting in line.  I didn't smell it.  Okay.  Now, some people decided to do this silly thing and order it on the internet.  Why did you decide to wait online?  I don't want to get ripped off by the internet, so I decided to just wait in line.  Have you heard a lot of horror stories between the internet going and ripping people off?  Scams and stuff like that, so I'm just going to avoid the internet. 
[03:06:30]  I'm just waiting in line.  Now, you know, it is a smart thing to avoid the internet.  What do you use your smartphone for?  Now we really got to break this down.  What the fuck is she doing with her mouth?  Yeah.  Is she eating?  Is she eating?  Is she eating?  No, she's like trying to get things out of her teeth.  Yeah.  Her tongue's going on.  Moving her mouth around.  Upper part.  The bottom part.  What's going on?  Oh, she's like a bully.  And the other thing you got to notice is the way she's clutching her purse the whole time.  Oh, yeah.  She's got a death grip on her purse.  And was there anything in her mouth or is she just...  Not that I saw. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, I don't think so.  That's...  She's stunk, though.  Did she smell that?  Like what, though?  B.O.  That would turn me on.  Really?  Yeah.  Stinky girl?  Yeah.  Smelly girl.  Smelly girl.  It smells.  Yeah, miss...  She was also sitting outside in an office chair.  None of us had any idea how she...  Oh, it's a little rolly office chair.  Like a really nice one.  Like a desk chair.  All right.  How'd she get that?  Comfy.  No clue.  She asked her.  I didn't think of it at the time.  All right.  Internet, what do you use your smartphone for?  Or what are you planning on using it for? 
[03:07:30]  Texting messages to my friends.  Well, it's good to get an iPhone.  I really want to break this down.  I fucking love this girl.  She gives the answer to your question.  Texts, messages, and then she's like...  She's moving her mouth.  But she also nods because she's proud of her answer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a good answer.  I totally landed that one.  I nailed that one.  Well, I'm too busy getting annoyed at Sam's nodding.  Like, good answer.  Great job.  Yes, yes.  Nodding along with her. 
[03:08:00]  He really is.  I have been reading some of the comments.  I mean, a lot of people say,  what the fuck is wrong with the interviewer?  What do you mean, what the fuck is wrong?  Because you're very stoic in your expressions.  Because I was getting information out of her.  Well, they're a little confused by you.  He's being...  It's a sarcastic interview.  Right.  He knows she's giving like...  Like when you say,  well, what are you going to use your iPhone for?  Right after she goes,  she's afraid of using the internet.  Right.  It's like, oh, that's a good choice.  You know, the iPhone.  It's getting her to talk as much as possible.  Sure.  Sam, preach into the choir.  You guys. 
[03:08:30]  All right.  Let's go back to this.  Yeah, go back a little  because I want to see that answer again.  And watch how proud she is.  Text or message?  And then she's like...  I'm sure this is on our Facebook page by now.  Open Anthony on Facebook.  It's on everybody else's.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Texting messages to my friends.  Watch.  Watch.  Watch.  What are the features about the new iPhone  that have you so excited?  I'm not sure because I haven't seen it yet,  but I'm pretty sure it would be, like,  really cool to use every day, like, a laptop. 
[03:09:00]  Sure.  What influenced you to get on this line then?  Like, everybody else that's waiting in line,  we're just, like, really wanting to buy Apple Phone 5.  Phone 5.  We want our phones now.  You're at a good point  because you have no idea what the iPhone 5 offers,  so it's like,  while all these people may be disappointed  or know what to expect, 
[03:09:30]  it's all going to be a surprise for you.  Yeah, and I can't wait, too,  because I heard that it's only $200  instead of $800,  so I'm very enthused.  I might buy two or three phones.  So what happens if you get into the store  and it costs more than $200?  That's right,  because I have my credit card.  Perfect.  Pay later.  Why not?  So we'll see what happens.  I really want iPhone 5,  and I'm not willing to walk out of my place in line. 
[03:10:00]  What is it about the iPhone 5  that makes you want it so much?  I like the way it's designed.  I like the Apple on it.  It's white.  It's like silver colors,  glass frames.  It's like really cool.  It's touchscreen.  Everything is really, really advanced  and cool about the iPhone 5.  It has a camera, I've heard.  I guess so.  I've never owned anything like that before in my life,  so we'll see.  It'll take still pictures of moving images.  That's even better. 
[03:10:30]  Have you been sitting here the entire time  for the last two days?  Yeah.  I mean, there's barricades up and everything.  I'm behind a barricade.  I'm waiting for Apple 5.  Apple 5.  And I will call my boyfriend  as soon as I get Apple 5.  Because you'll have a phone.  Yeah, and I can tell where I am  because I found out about Apple 5,  and I'm very hyped about it,  and I'm not willing to buy any other phone right now  because I want internet.  With the Apple 5.  Right.  And that internet won't scam you.  I hope not.  I don't think it ever will  because I use Apple 5 all the time, 
[03:11:00]  and I've never had a problem at all with Apple.  I mean, not Apple 5, but I use Apple.  Previous Apple.  I mean, yeah, I mean, Apple 4,  but Apple 5 is what I'm buying now, so.  Well, good luck.  I know.  So, you asked me about getting the Apple 5  because I've shared phones before with other people,  but I've never owned my own.  This is going to be great.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know.  She's great.  Did you get her number?  Like, we could have her on.  I did not. 
[03:11:30]  She could be a character.  I know, in hindsight, it's a good one.  She'd have been a great character.  She's the one that never got sponsored, too.  She's a pit for that one.  Do you have sponsored?  Everybody in line was sponsored by something.  How do they get sponsored?  Just because they pay for the phone.  Wear a shirt.  Yeah.  Wait, who pays for the phone?  Whoever gives them a shirt.  A company gives them their shirt.  They say, wear the shirt the whole time you're online.  Yeah, because the media comes through,  and then they buy them the phone.  She's getting logos.  For 800 bucks, whatever.  They're filming logos.  Apple 5.  Oh, I should do that.  Yeah.  Yeah, get a Jim Norton shirt online. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Or I should get a shirt that just says something crazy.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That would be good, too.  Yeah, like, whatever.  Ah, that's fucking good.  Sam, they posted that on CNET.  On CNET?  But she's a woman, so.  Where else?  MSN.  MSN.  A couple of smaller blogs.  Yeah.  It was factor fictioned a lot.  A couple of blogs headed up as the factor fiction of the day,  meaning is this real or not?  Oh, come now.  I'd love to.  Trending on YouTube, on the homepage.  Jerking you off.  The Blaze just posted it. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, yeah?  The Blaze.  Stunt Brain's site.  Stunty.  How come Stunt Brain wouldn't post my video until it was a viral thing?  Ah, he doesn't trust you.  Yeah, why don't you just post it when it first came out?  He knows you're full of turkey.  I'm not.  He's wrong.  And that's obvious.  He could have been on top of this from the beginning.  Yeah.  He could have been a trendsetter.  Nothing, Stunt Brain.  Instead of the follower that he is now.  He's just a follower.  Yeah.  We all know that.  What's that?  What's that?  Ooh.  Oh, is that Piper Parable?  Who is that?  Who is that lady? 
[03:13:00]  Clover Affairs on USA.  What's that show?  I have no one.  She's working the computer over there.  She's probably an intern.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Oh, they meant the actress.  It's not Piper Parable.  Oh, man.  Oh, is that a new intern?  Fuck.  Want to bring her in?  Jesus Christ.  Who is that bitch?  Go find out.  Find out who she is.  I want to make love to her.  Do some advance work, Sam.  Yeah, find out who she is.  Yeah.  Say we've just spotted her here in the fucking, in the dungeon. 
[03:13:30]  What?  Is that an HR issue?  To say hello?  I say that every time, don't I?  Yeah.  No?  Yeah, just ask who she is.  Do you want her to come in?  If she wants.  Yeah, we don't want to attack her.  We want to make love to her.  See if, uh, we should, we, we, Sam.  Just say it, because we all talk to the new interns.  We always do that.  Yeah.  Very good shit.  And we try to fuck the butts.  Yeah, yeah.  We try to fuck them in the butts.  Didn't we talk to her already? 
[03:14:00]  We talked to that one already.  No, we didn't.  No.  It's a new one.  We want to fuck the butt.  Bring her in so we can fuck her in the butt.  That's a new one.  Okay, she's coming in.  She's coming in.  She should be cool.  It's Ron and Fez's intern.  Oh, you're Ron and Fez's intern?  Come on in.  Hi, how are you?  Good, how are you?  Hi.  Good.  What do you do for Ron and Fez?  Uh, printing out one pages.  Yeah?  You smell very good.  What are you printing pages for?  Uh, Art Garfunkel.  Art Garfunkel.  Oh, what time is he in today?  I don't know.  Art Garfunkel's coming in today.  Do you know who he is? 
[03:14:30]  Uh, Simon Garfunkel.  Oh.  You know that.  How old a gal are you?  Uh, I'm 20.  Oh.  And you know who Simon and Garfunkel are?  My mom listens to them.  Ah.  That's good.  So what are you hoping to do here with this internship?  Uh, eventually work here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  You were two years old when we started our radio show.  That's all I'm thinking.  We've been at it 18 years, right?  That's hilarious.  That's weird.  So you're, wait, you're as old as my son.  Oh my God. 
[03:15:00]  How long have we been doing this?  Well, is your boyfriend happy that you're here or does he not like you to be here?  Oh, I don't have a boyfriend.  Good, good.  Oh.  See what Jimmy just did there?  Smart, Jimmy.  That's pretty good.  Very good.  Yeah?  No boyfriend?  No, no boyfriend.  Your fault or just the fault of guys?  No, I'm just too busy with school and this.  Career girl?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Very career-minded.  Very career girl.  Yeah?  Do you have a good relationship with the parents?  Uh, yeah.  Both of them?  Yeah.  Oh boy, what happened there?  No, nothing.  Yeah?  Divorced?  Nothing.  You had a look.  You looked up a little.  Yeah, actually recently. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, they're divorced?  Yeah.  Oh boy.  Do you feel like it was your fault?  No.  Do you feel rejected?  Not at all.  Do you feel abandoned?  No.  No?  No.  I'm 20.  I don't really care.  Yeah?  I'm at school.  I don't care.  That's kind of cool.  Did you know there were problems, though?  Yeah.  For many years?  How could you tell?  When they're fighting all the time.  Oh, shit.  Was it your dad's fault or your mom's?  He just, I don't know.  Was he doing things?  Was he coaching like a football team and he'd bring students downstairs and your mom would  ignore it? 
[03:16:00]  Disgusting.  But funny.  But funny.  But funny.  All right, good guy.  Good, good.  No, that wasn't it.  No, huh?  No.  He wasn't giving creepy massages?  No.  Okay.  What was his issue?  He was just not a nice guy?  No, he just doesn't do anything.  Oh boy.  Yeah.  Is he a drinker?  Do I drink?  No, is he a drinker?  No.  No, I don't know what it is.  Do you drink?  No.  Right.  Good answer because you're not allowed to drink at 20. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you did drink, let's say, what would you like to drink?  Oh, um, not, I'm not a big vodka girl.  Oh, so you're not a vodka girl.  Beer only.  Ah, okay.  Yeah.  Which is odd because girls usually, beer is not their drink of choice.  Yeah, they gravitate toward fancier schmancier drinks.  Which is worse because they get like sloppy and disgusting.  Oh boy.  And then date raped.  Yeah.  That happens.  Date raped.  Yeah.  What kind of beer?  Uh, Coors. 
[03:17:00]  Okay.  Coors.  You think you didn't say Old English?  No.  Where are you from?  Jersey.  And originally from Jersey?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Family didn't move around.  Do I have an accent or anything?  No.  Not too bad.  No, really?  Not too bad.  Oh, good, because I'm at school and everyone says I got an accent and I'm like, what?  Where do you go to school?  Pace, downtown.  Pace, downtown.  Pace University.  Pace University.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sure, yeah.  Where in Jersey did you grow up?  Central, Manhattan.  Oh, okay, I'm from, uh, North Brunswick.  Oh, okay, cool.  Look at you two.  Yeah, my cousin was from Manhattan. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, really?  His name was John.  That's all I'm going to get into right now.  That's all I want to really say.  We know Mike the Situation's from Manhattan, right?  Oh, boy.  What's that?  Mike the Situation?  Do you know him?  Oh, is he from Manhattan?  Did he know him before he was famous?  My brother had seen him at the gym and he said he was a tool, but.  He was nice when he was in here, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  We didn't really mind him.  He was very nice.  But I strongly feel he was a tool as well.  He was a tool.  Yeah.  But the one time we did meet him, he was actually very cool.  Are you a big fan of the situation? 
[03:18:00]  No.  Do you like, who's your favorite Jersey Shore person?  Oh, my God.  This is my opening line with every girl.  None of them.  Ronnie.  Oh, there you go.  That's Ronnie.  I think Ronnie's a blast.  We gotta get him.  Do you like this snookster?  I like her.  Oh, boo.  See her baby?  He's cute.  Yeah.  Is it adorable?  It is a cute baby.  Yeah.  It's hot.  What, uh, so you like working for Rana Fez?  Yeah, I love it.  Yeah?  Well, I did, I did electric air and BPM over summer.  What the hell's that? 
[03:18:30]  The dance, the dance channel.  I have no idea.  The channel's nobody listens to.  Yeah, what could you possibly do for that channel?  Hand out earplugs?  Not much, to be honest.  That's the shit that has the same song playing for eight straight hours.  Sounds like it.  Yeah.  Sounds like it, definitely.  What could you possibly do for that?  So when was your last relationship?  Uh, never had one.  What?  Mm-hmm.  What's the problem?  Come on.  Nothing.  I just, come on, you guys are guys.  Never had a boyfriend.  Wow. 
[03:19:00]  Hey, wait, can I see your prep sheet for Rana Fez?  I want to see the type of prep work she's doing.  I think Pepper's actually probably seeing where I am right now.  Okay, hold on.  Oh, don't worry about it.  Look at how much.  Tell Pepper we got this.  Yeah, tell Pepper to shut the fuck up.  Yeah, tell Pepper to mind his business.  Yeah.  Pepper dicks.  That's what I call him.  That's right.  You tell him.  Okay, it's pretty much, uh.  Pretty good?  Yeah, I would love to talk to Art Garfunkel.  That would be kind of old.  He's not until 11.15.  But, yeah, fuck him.  You're not going to wait around and meet him?  Where's his buddy? 
[03:19:30]  Simon.  Simon.  His buddy.  His buddy.  Is he alive still?  Yeah, I would imagine they don't really like each other.  Yeah, they every so often, every fucking 20 years, they have a reunion.  They make believe every once in a while.  And sing their little songs.  Very harmonic.  Wow, so, uh, no relationship.  No, no relationship.  It's odd for a girl, not even in school or anything.  No.  Are you very studious?  Well, I go to Pace.  Yeah?  What does that mean?  So, if you can get it from, I live in, I'm in the city, so the boys are. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, but that doesn't explain high school.  There's no straight men, basically, in high school, is what I'm trying to say.  So, it's hard.  But it doesn't explain high school or junior high school.  Mmm, no.  Well, I'm from Jersey, like, Manalapun, especially, they're all, like, my situation, if I could  put it that way.  Could I, could I ask you a question?  Uh, are you in any way, shape, or form attracted to black men?  Um...  Why are you flinching?  What?  I'm waiting for an answer.  We're both flinching for different reasons.  It's a, yeah, I mean...  Oh, good girl.  Look at it. 
[03:20:30]  Oh.  I'm not racist.  What?  All right.  Now, are you, uh, are you saving yourself from marriage?  I hate not racists.  I guess it's time to go home.  She's not racist.  Have you ever dated a black guy?  No.  Have you ever...  Oh, you never...  I'm sorry.  There's only that many black people in my time.  Have you ever, you know...  Have you ever kissed a boy?  Yes, I have.  Oh.  Have you ever...  I'm not that rude.  Why are we allowed to ask interns these days?  You can ask them anything.  You can ask anything.  It's on the show.  Oh, God.  Right.  Have you ever, um...  Have you done more than kiss a boy?  Yes.  Oh, boy. 
[03:21:00]  Really?  Look at this.  Do tell.  Have you ever cupped a boy's testicles and said,  These are weighty.  Can't say I said that.  No.  No, you probably wouldn't want to say something like that.  No.  Have you ever, uh, put a finger where the duty comes out?  Oh, my God.  Now it's just getting fucking out of hand.  Kissing the bear.  What happened?  What happened?  Oh, my God.  These are questions we need to know.  Uh, have, have, have you gone what they would call all the way? 
[03:21:30]  Yes.  So you're not a virgin.  Just because I never had a boyfriend.  I think I'm a virgin.  No, I didn't.  Okay.  But if you don't have a boyfriend and you've had, uh, that type of relationship with a boy,  that means, uh...  Oh, what?  Right?  No, no.  I'm teasing, of course.  Pick a number between, uh, between one and three.  Two.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  What's that mean?  It means she hasn't given up the, uh...  Oh, God.  Oh, my God. 
[03:22:00]  Oh.  What?  It's just another way to get the answer to that.  I've never heard that before, ever.  I've never either.  So you're doing two people, huh?  But I'm right.  No, more.  Am I right?  Two.  No, three.  Am I right?  No, I've never heard that before.  No, am I right, though?  No.  No, he's talking about giving up the...  Oh.  Am I right?  No.  Giving up that place that girls don't give up until...  So I was right.  They feel that they've, um...  The armpit.  They've outlived their usefulness.  That's terrible.  You guys are a different generation.  You don't know how it is.  Oh, man.  I do, though, because I tend to date younger gals. 
[03:22:30]  How old are you?  44.  And how young have you dated?  Um, I won't go any younger than 21.  That's crazy.  But I mean, um...  Fucking prude.  I have 20, 21, I'm fine with.  Because I'm immature, though.  Oh, okay.  So it works.  I don't want to...  You know?  But I like the fact that she didn't know I was 44 of the best.  I like ages that...  Wow, you're 44?  You don't look 44.  I like ages that end in teen.  That's a good age.  Yes, but nothing like fifth or sixth or seventh or eighth or ninth or ninth. 
[03:23:00]  He only likes third, fourth.  Yeah, I'm very immature.  Yeah.  I'm very immature.  I don't like to have...  I'm afforded that lifestyle.  I'm not looking for marriage.  Okay.  I like a nice gal that I can treat well and go out to the movies.  And have fun.  How old is the oldest guy you've dated? 
[03:23:30]  21.  Wow.  Wait, I was 19 at the time.  Nine, okay.  Jesus, that's not like last year.  That's kind of nothing.  That's very close.  That's a very close age.  I haven't been that old.  Don't go into thirties?  No.  Forties?  No.  Fifties?  You're sixties?  It depends who it is.  If it's like a celebrity or something.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  Like a popular radio show host or...  Or one on this program.  She's like, no, she said a celebrity.  Yeah, it's probably a celebrity.  Yeah, exactly.  Hacks, I know.  Like Sanchez. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, but he's with Eva's.  Dirty?  I sum myself up for that one.  You certainly did.  Yes, you did.  So, Ron and Fez are back today?  Yeah.  Oh.  I didn't know they were gone.  I never know.  Fez was apparently in the loony bin or something, right?  Oh, I want to say loony bin.  Was he?  Well, that's what I heard.  He was institutionalized.  He was institutionalized for a week to kind of get his shit together, I guess.  Is he back?  Did he get out?  I haven't seen him.  I've been doing this one page downstairs, so... 
[03:24:30]  What's wrong with Fez?  They're going to be like, it's taking him forever.  I don't know.  He's just got anxiety, but he's a good guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He goes.  Would you date Fez?  No.  He wouldn't date me, so I wouldn't date him.  Oh.  Well.  Yeah, okay.  How about Ronnie?  Did you date Ronnie?  No.  Why not?  He'd be a fun guy to go out with.  No.  Why?  Because, I mean,  No, it's just weird.  He'd just be sitting there in a restaurant all curmudgeonly with a cigar.  Not...  So, uh...  What do you do?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what he'd be like.  Why are you ordering soup?  Yeah. 
[03:25:00]  Uh...  You guys have a good impression.  He'd be fun, I think.  He'd get a lot of stories.  He is fun.  He's funny.  He'd tell you what the old days were like.  You know?  Vaudeville.  I mean, I'm on the radio.  I talked to them all the time.  They're great.  They're funny as hell.  I don't like soup.  Yeah.  Right there, Fez.  Hey, Fez.  Who knew Ron was so against soup?  He hates soup.  He's a soup hater.  Yeah.  He would not be fun to be in a restaurant with for that one reason. 
[03:25:30]  I think...  I've been out with Ronnie, and it is a blast to go out with him.  Really?  Yeah.  He's a lot of fun.  Fun guy.  What does he say?  I don't know.  He probably didn't order the soup, though.  It's just that.  Like, when we're out, we would go to a bar, and there'd be listeners there or something.  He's just got great insight on people, and it's very, very funny to listen to him.  What are these people?  Oh, my God.  What the hell's going on?  What was that girl on the purple?  The hustle and bustle.  That was awkward. 
[03:26:00]  I love her.  That was so awkward.  I love her.  We were all looking at her.  Yeah.  She's so pretty.  I'd love to take her for a malted.  Malted?  Yeah.  So what do you like doing?  Not you, Jimmy.  What do you like doing with yourself when you're not here or schooling yourself?  DJing.  DJing?  Oh, D.  Uh-oh.  Are you a DJ?  Have you seen Troy Kwan?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  What do you think of Troy?  I've seen him before.  I haven't seen him DJ.  Yeah.  Did you, uh, you know.  How old is he? 
[03:26:30]  Oh, boy.  He's like 40.  Yeah.  He's 40.  He's 40.  He doesn't look 40.  Wow.  You guys look good for your age.  It's amazing, right?  Must be a radio thing.  And it's 2017.  Yeah.  I've got a hard life.  Very hard life.  Yeah.  Radios.  You'll start, uh, you'll start going out with older guys, though, once you realize the younger  guys are a whole bunch of fucking assholes.  And they can't take care of young guys.  The broke ass broke.  Yeah.  The too self-centered to give their all in the bedroom.  Probably.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what it's all about.  When I'm in bed, I give it, I give everything to her. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, exactly.  And I say that the whole time.  You remind her.  This is for you.  This is for you.  This is for you.  Don't you forget it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you smack her around a little bit.  Yeah.  For you.  For you.  For you.  It's great.  That's over.  Yeah.  For you.  For you.  For you.  As soon as I'm done, I go, okay, now you get out.  That is awful.  Yeah.  So, you know, I'm getting close for you, for you, for you, for you.  Are Ron and Fez this, like, dirty with you?  No.  No, they're very respectful, right? 
[03:27:30]  They are nice guys.  I think we've been fairly respectful.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, no, not really.  You, you, you.  What?  That's just a joke.  Oh, I know.  I know a joke when I see it.  I'll let you know if I see one.  I didn't say it was a good joke.  I said it was an attempt at once.  That girl on the purple is very attractive.  I like her.  She was pretty.  Who is she?  I have no idea.  Did you find out?  Just say, hey, I'm an intern.  What's your name?  No, that's like, it's just a good thing I'm a lesbian.  Have you ever?  No.  No?  Not even a little?  Kissing camp or something? 
[03:28:00]  Nice.  No.  I know that's a thing nowadays.  I know.  Finally a fucking, like, a regular straight girl.  Never happens.  No, it happens.  I've seen it before.  I've never done it.  Yeah?  How have you seen it?  Were you at a party?  Did you walk into the coat room and see something happening?  No.  Oh.  No, no.  Out in the open.  They do it out in the open.  Yeah.  Everyone can see.  Lesbian chic these days.  Everybody.  What do you do when you watch?  I don't really watch.  I come just laughing.  Like, ew.  Ew?  Oh, you think it's gross?  No, it's just so stupid.  Like, they're just trying to get attention.  Yeah. 
[03:28:30]  Come on.  It really is a cry for attention.  Yeah, but you guys are like, oh, yeah.  See?  The young guys do that.  Oh, yeah.  The guys have experienced just going, oh, that old gag.  Yeah, I just go look at the lezzies.  Yeah.  Where's the straight girls?  That's what we say.  It's true.  I love Lesbos.  I love dealing with this shit.  Yeah.  You know?  So, um, what kind of radio do you want to do?  Like, if you get in the business?  I want to do, like, kind of like Sway.  Like, music and kind of talk.  Oh, boy.  So, you'll get out of the desire to do music in a while.  Yeah. 
[03:29:00]  I don't want to do music.  It stinks.  Why not?  I love music.  We all do, but it's more fun to talk.  It is.  It's a lot more fun to talk.  Why do you want to play somebody else's stuff?  Yeah, we have to be funny.  Like, you guys are funny, so people can listen to you if you're not funny.  There's plenty of people who aren't funny that have radio shows that are serious.  It's supposed to be funny.  Yeah.  Things like that.  No, but I mean, there's plenty of people who do serious talk.  You could do a...  Are you interested in politics?  Uh, yeah.  Why don't you talk about politics?  Obviously, you're an Obama supporter, so you could...  I'm saying because you're young.  No?  No.  Oh, you're not?  You're Romney.  No, yeah.  Okay. 
[03:29:30]  Wow, a Republican.  I know.  Nice.  Isn't that crazy?  So, what do you like about him?  Romney?  Yeah.  Well, I don't like Obama, so...  I mean, I don't really like Romney, but I don't like Obama.  Because he's black, right?  No, that's not it.  You could say it.  You're such a racist.  No, that's not it.  You feel that those people are wrecking everything.  No, it's nothing to do with the racist.  Those people.  You guys are crazy.  Ah, shit.  You feel something needs to be done about those people.  Listen, we are too dependent on government.  I like that.  I said it.  That's true. 
[03:30:00]  I said it.  It is very true.  And with you, you probably have big plans for yourself.  Very successful.  Make my own success.  Yes.  And the Obama administration seems to be against people that are successful.  Very true.  And self-made.  But guys like us who have made a lot of money.  Yes, exactly.  A lot of money.  Been able to buy a big house with a pool that's still open and heated.  A movie theater.  Nice.  It's still open and heated now?  Oh, yeah.  It's autumn.  I don't care.  It's still open and heated. 
[03:30:30]  Does it matter?  It's still nice to have you still hop in?  Yeah, you could if you wanted.  Something like that.  Would you swim in Anthony's house?  That's great.  Where do you live?  Well, I live out on Long Island.  It's almost like Jersey.  Not a Long Islander.  What?  I don't know.  I have an apartment in Manhattan.  Also.  No pool, but it's fun.  They'll throw water on you.  It's in the tub.  It's in the tub.  Yo, wee and yay.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Well, you're very nice.  Your name is Dana? 
[03:31:00]  Mm-hmm.  Dana.  Yeah.  What nationality are you?  Italian.  I'm Italian.  100%.  And Czechoslovakian.  Oh, wow.  That's kind of fun.  75% Italian, 25% Czech.  Which part do you prefer?  Italian.  I like you.  Dana's very pretty.  She's wearing tight blue jeans and a nice white t-shirt and a pinkish scarf.  Coral, actually.  Coral.  Wouldn't it be fun to be able to say, the male's in the Czech?  See, that's a little play on words. 
[03:31:30]  I can't say I get it.  Because, you know, you're of a generation where not many things are in the mail.  It used to be the Czechs in the mail would be like, don't worry, the Czechs in the mail.  I get it.  Okay.  The males in the Czech would be somebody having sex with someone of Czechoslovakian heritage.  Or at least half Czech.  Half Czech.  Yeah.  The half Czechs in the mail.  The males in the mail.  The males in the half Czech.  Whatever.  Light.  Do you always wear a coral?  I love coral.  You're like a splash of color, though. 
[03:32:00]  Coral and turquoise, I love.  Oh, so you like those pastel kind of...  Not obnoxiously, though.  Do you like lime green?  No.  What are the pastels you like?  Who's this chick?  This chick?  Wow, there's a hot one outside the studio.  This after 10, it just turns into, let's find girls we can talk to.  Look, we're lonely people.  I want to meet as someone special.  Why not at work?  A nice girl who's driven to be in the same business?  Right.  If not Dana, then another one.  A lot to talk about. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  Afterwards, she'd go, how was the show?  I'd be like, oh, today.  Hey, let me tell you.  She'd go, really?  Then it'd be cool.  We could talk.  Things like that, you know.  Yeah.  Laugh about it after.  Do you know what happened?  Forget about it.  She has no interest in old fogies.  Maybe she doesn't, but she could talk us up to other women who might.  But, see, this is called doing groundwork.  I don't associate with any other.  Well, you will.  When we start asking you, look, talk to her.  There's a cute one outside there.  I'd love you to mention me to her.  Yeah?  Boy, that gym. 
[03:33:00]  Is this lady right here sitting on the chair?  Ah, you got nailed.  You got nailed right there.  There's another lady walking.  Oh, there she is right there holding me.  Oh, the Asian one.  She's Asian?  Is she kind of Asian?  I can't tell.  You're so racist.  It's okay to say that.  God, are you a racist?  She's Asian.  She's very cute.  You point out their race.  Why not say the girl with the hair on her head?  You know.  I'm teasing, of course.  I don't know where that other girl went who I really liked with the purple pants.  The purple pants, yeah.  I like her outfit.  Did you?  It's your responsibility to help me get her. 
[03:33:30]  Just get her number for me.  No, that's so weird.  Unless I say it's for you.  Say, yo, Jimmy wants your digits.  I gotta say it like that.  Oh, boy.  Who's this one?  Nah, she's kind of short and chubby.  It's not my thing.  You know enough about black culture where you'd feel comfortable dating a black guy?  Yeah.  Sure.  Oh, God.  Listen, my mom and I, I don't care what they are as long as they cheat me right.  Oh, well, then you've got to go white. 
[03:34:00]  Please, let's be honest here.  They're not really known as people that, you know.  Ah.  Do you have nice toes?  Me?  Okay, I'm not a foot guy.  What?  Do you have open-toed shoes on?  No, I have Sperry's on.  Are they, what size foot do you have?  Seven.  Seven and a half.  Are they a lot of corns on them, your feet?  No, that's gross.  Are they nice?  Yeah.  Soft.  They're nice.  Nice toe placement?  Yeah.  Not weird?  No weird long one?  Yeah, no warts or anything like that?  No fucking bunions?  No, no.  Your little pinky toes and just placed in an ugly way on the top of your foot? 
[03:34:30]  Oh, God.  No webbed feet.  Nothing.  No webs.  Nope.  Calluses?  Nope.  Varicose veins?  Nope.  Mm-mm.  Very good.  I don't really know what that was, but I don't have them.  Varicose veins is when people get those awful blue.  Dark veins.  No.  Dark veins.  Usually I'm carrying a baby.  Oh, boy.  They have varicose.  When I used to get mad at my mom, I would insult her varicose veins when I was young.  That's mean.  I was a jerk.  I was a jerk.  That is very mean to me.  I was 13.  I was 13.  That's mean.  God.  When my grandmother ate, she would make a clicking sound. 
[03:35:00]  When she chewed, because of her false teeth, she would always say, you click when you  eat.  What a nasty man you were.  You were just a nasty little boy.  Mean to your mommy and your grandma.  Yeah, I was kind of a douche.  Point that out.  I don't know.  You're treating your family like hecklers.  You ever see Jimmy perform?  No.  What do you perform?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh.  Oh.  Comedy.  That's okay.  She doesn't have to know.  I don't know.  If he was an actor or an aspiring actor. 
[03:35:30]  Sure.  He likes to think.  Yeah, do some acting.  Hey, what's over there?  See, that's like a scene.  That would be good if something was over there.  No, because there's not.  It's even more impressive.  That's true.  That's a movie I'm writing where a guy just discovers all these things.  Hey.  Check that out.  It's that over there.  Yeah.  Where do you perform?  UCB or something?  Oh, boy.  I've done UCB.  I've done stand-up there.  It's great crowds.  A-I-D-S.  What's that?  I-D-S?  A-I-D-S.  Oh. 
[03:36:00]  A-I-D-S.  See?  I'm saying he has AIDS.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, Jimmy.  I work, uh.  See how immature we are?  Yeah.  I just laughed really hard at that.  I laugh.  I, uh, I work at the Comedy Cellar a lot.  You ever been in the Comedy Cellar?  No.  Big place.  Lots of celebrities.  Oh, yeah.  Where is it?  In the village.  Heart of the village.  Yeah.  Heart of Gretchen's village.  The big, the big time.  Yeah, what comedy clubs have you gone to?  Uh, none.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  A lot of none.  But I have someone who goes to UCB often, and he does some shows there. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, is he a friend?  Yeah.  Is he an improv actor?  Uh, yeah.  Is he funny?  Yeah, he's funny.  Is he a hipster?  Great guy.  Uh, no.  Are you a hipster?  No.  What do you think of Occupy Wall Street?  Stupid.  Yes.  Very nice.  I'm still not ever getting past the black thing, but.  What are you going to do?  She's a nice girl.  Especially an Italian girl.  I'll probably marry an Italian.  Yeah.  To be completely honest.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's good.  Are you short?  How tall are you? 
[03:37:00]  Uh, like 5'4"?  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  That's nice.  No idea.  It's a good height for a girl.  I like a taller girl.  Six foot.  Why?  I just, I'm fine.  It's weird.  No, I like a girl who's bigger.  Like, because she has big, long thighs.  Oh, bigger.  Big hiney.  Oh, bigger.  So you're not saying taller.  No, taller, too.  Taller, too?  Because a taller girl in good shape.  But you want her to be taller than you?  Yeah.  That's weird.  I could never date a guy that's shorter than me.  I want her to, that's because you're already short.  Any guy shorter than you is probably getting disability checks.  So I prefer, I prefer a nice, tall 5'10", 5'11", a fucking beast. 
[03:37:30]  Wow.  But not fat at all.  Okay.  Like, if she's fat, I won't even be friends with her.  But I like, I wouldn't even give her directions.  But I want a tall woman, I think is great.  Tall.  Yeah.  Like a basketball player tall?  No, not like, not...  Creepy tall?  Not one that will stop traffic.  Right.  Yeah, but what if she wears heels?  What if you go out to a party and she's wearing heels and she's just towering over you?  Fine.  She's the one who should be humiliated. 
[03:38:00]  She will be.  She probably won't date you, though.  She'll be like, wow, I'm taller than this guy.  Yeah, she will because I'm funny and I spend money on her and I cup her buttocks when we  walk because she's all tall with big heels.  Very good.  I rub her rump.  Guy ever spend money on you?  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Like a lot?  No.  Why don't you ever buy you a car?  We're out for dinner and...  Oh, shit.  What kind of dinner?  Give me a bag of shells.  That was a rush, Sean.  Did it start with Mac?  Yeah, Roy Roger's.  Ha, ha, Roy Roger's.  Roy Roger's. 
[03:38:30]  Jim Ford team.  Roy Roger's.  Is it named after royalty?  Yeah.  Uh, Jesus.  No?  Yeah?  Bought you a dinner, huh?  Mm-hmm.  Did you?  How far did he get?  Uh...  Oh, that was all the way.  Dinner's all the way.  Wow.  That's pretty good.  Usually cost me a lot.  That was one of them, right?  One of them was one of them.  That was the first date.  Oh, no.  How many dates?  Uh, a couple.  Couple.  Couple?  Oh, man.  That's two. 
[03:39:00]  On the set, what was the first date?  How did that end up?  In the car?  Kind of fooling around a little bit?  No, not really.  Handshake?  Gentle handshake?  No.  Pat on the ass as you got out the car?  Did he pull his hog out in the cab?  No.  Did he slow down and toss you out?  Yeah.  Did he pull it out and slap it on the steering wheel?  And go, looky, looky, looky.  Take a look-see.  What are you looking at, Sam?  Somebody reacting to my video?  Oh.  Wow. 
[03:39:30]  You are just hung up on yourself.  Exactly.  Jesus.  All right.  I guess we're done.  I mean, I want to meet our Garfunkel, though.  Well, you could hang around.  He might not be here.  It might be another day.  I don't know if he's here today.  No, it's today.  Oh, it is today?  Yeah.  Gee, you work for the show and you don't even know.  They don't really tell me that much.  I just do whatever they tell me to do and I do it.  And I don't ask questions.  I just get done.  Need-to-know basis.  What's today?  It's Monday?  It's Monday.  I'll tell you who else is here.  Who?  Elmo and Rosita. 
[03:40:00]  Art Garfunkel.  I saw that on the sign.  Elmo?  Elmo.  And Eric Legrand.  Who's that?  The guy in the wheelchair.  That's a lot of guys.  The Rutgers football player?  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's pretty huge.  Hold on.  Who else is here now?  Today?  Is there anybody else on Monday?  I thought...  What's-her-name was here?  Who's the singer?  Cindy Lauper's here.  No way.  Wow.  Is she really?  She's right in the store.  I haven't seen her.  You like her, too?  I want to get a picture of her.  She's the...  She's an outcube. 
[03:40:30]  Don't scream at me.  Is she the...  Oh, my God.  Do you have your camera, you rock?  Uh-oh.  Is she the what?  Girls just want to have fun?  Yes.  That's her.  Girls just want to have fun.  I was so nervous to say it.  I was like, shit, what if she doesn't see it?  Oh, that's the one.  That's her.  I like that song a lot.  I do.  Because they just want to...  My favorite part would be when she'd go, oh, girls!  And I would actually sing it like that.  I'm very tired.  Me, too.  Well, Danny, it was a pleasure talking to you.  We don't get real girls in here very often.  Yeah, I've heard. 
[03:41:00]  Very lovely.  Yeah.  Aren't we nicer than you thought we'd be?  Very nice.  Yeah, we're hysterical.  We didn't make you uncomfortable, right?  No, not at all.  You're very nice, girl.  Very good.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Goodbye, Dana.  Thank you for talking to us.  Very casually dressed, too.  Yeah, why don't you pick it up a notch.  Oh, man.  Okay.  She's a nice girl.  All right.  Very nice.  I guess you could hear her today on Rana Fez.  No, you can hear Rana Fez on Rana Fez.  She probably won't be on.  I bet she will be to talk about her experience here. 
[03:41:30]  Who Kid what?  Who Kid wants to come say hi.  Yeah, of course.  Who Kid can do whatever he wants because he gave us Mike Tyson.  Bring Who Kid in.  Who Kid.  What's up, man?  Hi, buddy.  How you been?  Good.  Hi.  Are you interviewing Cyndi Lauper today?  I just saw her.  She's over there.  I want to get a photo with her.  Yeah.  She's not mad.  We're still on.  We're not live, are we?  Yeah, we're still on.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  We're still on.  I know.  I'm like packing up and we're still live.  Hey, does Roland have his camera here today?  I'm going to talk shit right now.  Ah, shit.  We could have.  Oh, man. 
[03:42:00]  We could have him talking shit.  Although, it doesn't matter if it's off the air or on the air.  It's like hip-hop police up here.  Kid's just going to talk shit anyway.  Make some shit up.  Nah, she's hot, though.  I just saw her.  Cyndi Lauper?  Cyndi Lauper.  I've never met her.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, he was going to hang himself out to dry.  There is a God.  What are you going to say?  She's ugly?  Nah, she's actually cute.  What?  Oh, boy.  She's very hot.  I've never seen her in person.  I would bang her.  You would?  Right now.  But you're a married man. 
[03:42:30]  You can't do stuff like that.  I still bang people.  Oh, it doesn't matter?  I didn't know you were married, yeah?  I've been married for 15 years, but I still bang outside the country.  That's nice.  Yeah, that's allowed.  She don't mean shit in Paris.  It's completely allowed.  Bitches in Paris.  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  You don't cheat all the time?  No, I mean, I've only been married, you know, three months.  Oh, man.  I forgot you're married.  Jesus.  I haven't had time to cheat yet.  Plus, who's going to cheat with me?  Ugh.  Stop.  You got a viral video.  That's true. 
[03:43:00]  Did you know that?  Chicks are just going to be fucking not going to get it.  You have a new video out?  Are you serious?  I got internet fame.  Wow.  He is famous.

That's it.  All right, dude.  We get that shirt from you.  This is Mike Tyson's show.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty cool.  My style's impetuous.  Impetuous?  I got to shock you guys with another guest in like two more weeks, though.  Oh, man.  Really?  Somebody else?  Some crazy guy, but I DJ with his nephew in clubs.  Oh, I know who it is.  Oh.  But you're going to be kind of shocked. 
[03:43:30]  All I got to do is say he's Jewish.  That's all I got to say.  Okay, yeah.  I definitely know who he is.  And he's crazy and he's Jewish?  Yeah.  You guys will be happy.  There's a lot of crazy Jewish people out there.  What day, though?  Because I want to make sure I'm here.  David Berkowitz?  Yeah.  David.  Jesus.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  What day?  Who gets I know I'm here?  It's going to be like a Tuesday or Wednesday in two more weeks.  So just check the calendar.  Oh, no.  I think I'm here.  It's going to be a kick the door down. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, man.  It's subject to change, though.  I mean, that Tyson thing came through like literally the night before.  Crazy Jew.  Goldberg?  Goldberg.  Goldberg.  It's Goldberg.  He's just going to come in and spear everybody.  It's not Scarlett Burnett, I'll tell you that.  No.  Why so late?  She's doing a live interview right now.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Eight minutes from now.  I apologize.  I thought it was an hour from now.  Yeah, she's still over there.  I just came from over there.  Poor Kenny's toiling in my Escalade right now.  Oh, you're doing a show.  He's toiling.  Come right out.  Just the, ugh.  He's got to sit in there.  Those nice seats. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  Listening to this drivel.  Sorry, Kenny.  You don't have to wait for me.  What?  You don't have to wait for me.  Kenny can just take off.  No, he's in my truck.  So he's waiting for me.  Oh, that's hilarious.  He drives my truck around.  You're doing your job as a radio host.  You're talking on the radio.  Since when?  We're talking to our friend, who gave us a very great guest.  I freeload here for four hours a day.  Now, who's the crazy Jewish guy?  That's what I really want to know.  But you DJed with his nephew.  Yeah.  Which means he's probably at least 35 or 40 if you DJed with his nephew.  He's actually like almost 60. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, man.  Almost 60.  But he's a legend.  Oh.  And it's not Mel Brooks because Mel Brooks is older.  I know who it is.  He's still alive.  I know, right?  That shit.  I know who it is.  You know who it is?  Yes, I do.  Does he have glasses?  Something like that.  Uh-oh.  W-A?  He loves Chinese food.  Oh, shit.  How'd you get him?  I DJed with his nephew.  So you're interviewing him.  Wow.  That's huge.  I've met him.  I don't know him, but we've talked before.  Oh, for real?  I asked him about writing.  Oh, okay.  These pretzels are making me thirsty. 
[03:45:30]  He didn't, um...  He's actually a musician, too, so...  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, so don't be surprised if you bring, like, a fucking tuba.  The ukulele.  Don't he play the clarinet?  Yeah, he likes the, you know, the nigga music.  He's like, doo-doo-doo-doo.  Oh, shit.  Is that what that is?  He can say it.  Don't you worry about it.  Like that fucking word.  It's nice to finally hear it the way we've been saying it.  So, um, I would love to interview him, man.  I would love to.  Yeah, I'll see why...  He'd have fun on this show.  He's my nigga, too. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, man.  He is?  Yeah.  Wow.  Throw that word around like it's in my car.  You know, I like chains for the two, so...  Oh, yeah, huh?  Anthony has told me privately that that's the number one thing he likes that you bring to the after show.  Oh, for real?  Is use of the N-word.  Frequent use of the N-word.  Yeah.  Correct?  Well, I'm everybody's nigga.  You know what I'm saying?  I try to use it just as much as I'm hearing it when I'm driving home.  And it's very easy when I pull up next to a car that's been in my way to hurl that one out.  No, but y'all my niggas, though. 
[03:46:30]  It's all good, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Exactly.  That's the way you say it, right, Ian?  Oh, yeah.  All the time.  All the time.  Are you friends with Eminem?  Of course.  I have no choice.  Well, he's your boss.  Yeah, boss and friend.  He runs the show.  I never met Eminem, but we would love to talk to him, too.  Oh, for real?  You got to catch him when he sneaks up here when he was at a concert in New York.  Yeah.  I think he was here last time.  Yeah, but he comes up here at like 5 o'clock in the afternoon for like 30 minutes.  30 minutes.  He's sneaking in the back door.  You got to talk to Stephen Blatter, the guy you hate so much, you know?  Who hates him? 
[03:47:00]  We actually like Blatter.  Oh, yeah, I like Blatter.  I like Blatter, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I don't like when he silently shrugs like...  Yeah, yeah.  He does his disapproving shrug face with his awful jackets.  I like his outfits on Friday.  Like, he doesn't wear a suit.  Oh, casual.  I love to have your kids, but Kenny waits.  Where are you going?  I'm trying to talk to you about something.  Ah, no.  All right.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  We got an after show.  See ya.  We'll try.  What's on with Stephen Blatter, man?  You hang out with him, right?  Tell Dumbbell that I'll just go get a cab. 
[03:47:30]  You hang out with him?  We go to strip clubs a lot, but, you know.  Me and Stephen Blatter.  Here?  It's in the city.  Yeah.  That's where you go?  Mm-hmm.  What do you like to do there?  What does he like to do there?  I don't know.  He likes it when the girls stick each other toys with each other, but, you know.  But that's his...  I might as well say that.  That's his thing.  Yeah, that's his thing.  He likes to lay under...  Like, when two girls are ass-dildoing each other, he likes to lay under and look up like  it's a little bridge.  Oh, really?  He likes to lay between their ass cheeks and look up.  Where's casual clothes?  Of course.  It's Friday.  Yeah. 
[03:48:00]  Check and get his check, you know what I'm saying?  What else are you going to do?  Cashing that check.  I never saw...  I thought he'd get, like, a direct deposit to his account, but he actually goes and cashes  his checks at the Spanish spots.  He goes to check cashing?  I'm guessing he'd know the percentage.  He takes his paycheck from here and he goes to check cashing?  Let me start with Blatter, man.  Hey, what percent do they take, by the way?  Damn.  Check cashing?  Like, 20?  Is it?  I thought it was like 8% or something like that.  I don't know.  Check cashing takes a lot.  White people don't do that.  Only, like, Spanish.  I've done it a couple of times, but not in many years. 
[03:48:30]  Oh, for real?  Many years, yeah.  Get out of here, for real.  It's a terrible investment.  It's a terrible use of funds.  But you're my nigga, then.  You're a nigga.  I don't do it.  Oh, okay.  But it's because I used to do drugs, so when you drink and do drugs...  You just want that cash.  That's why they have those places, and, you know...  Where were you working at the time?  Probably Bradley's, or fuck it.  I worked at Bradley's.  Oh, didn't you work at Caldor for a while?  Yes, I did.  I worked at Caldor.  You remember Caldor, who, kid?  Wow, that's way back, man.  Yeah, 87, 88, in Bradley's I worked.  That was my first job. 
[03:49:00]  Monty Marsh was my supervisor, Mr. Marsh.  You hated him?  No, I actually liked him.  Oh, okay.  He wasn't a bad guy.  I mean, he treated me okay.  Oh.  And then at Caldor, my boss was OCD and was always constantly wringing his hands.  I never realized what a fucking OCD wreck he was.  Damn, serious?  Because you were just trying to get money for drugs at the time.  You really weren't concerned with his OCD.  I don't know if I was or not, but I was saying Caldor was a...  I was like...  I might have been sober at that point.  They have no Purell back then?  No.  In the 80s?  Not really, no.  That's crazy. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah.  Did you get the new iPhone?  Not at 5.  I'm getting it, I think, before I leave for Europe.  When are you going back to Europe?  I leave Friday before...  But I think I might leave Saturday evening because I'm interviewing Enrique Inglises' mole for BET weekend.  For BET weekend?  Yeah, you know, you gotta have Enrique Inglises' mole.  It's a televised interview.  Yeah.  And the mole's coming up.  Yeah, it's getting FedEx from fucking Spain.  Do you like Enrique Inglises?  Are you gonna mention his mole?  Yeah.  I actually know him personally, but I didn't want him to come this time. 
[03:50:00]  I just wanted the mole.  Just the mole.  Just to talk to the mole for a while.  We got little kid's nose.  We got mad body parts coming through.  Who Kid is, like, the best person to follow on Instagram because he travels all the time.  Yeah.  And he decides, like, late...  Because he DJs.  And so he's up late at night.  And in the middle of the night, he just posts kissy cam pictures, which is just girls kissing  each other at all these different clubs he's going to.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, he was in Russia or something a little while back.  Yeah, tongue and kissing.  And he must have had a half dozen photos of Russian chicks just making out.  How do you get these gigs? 
[03:50:30]  It's great.  I mean, they just book me.  Oh, okay.  While 50's doing a movie, they just kidnap me and then I just do their clubs.  That's what I'm doing this weekend.  And then I'm in Dubai with 50 the following week.  Oh, wow.  That's great, man.  You should come through and, you know, get some bitches.  I've wanted to go to Dubai a lot.  Do you guys fly Emirates?  Yeah, we go Emirates Air or whatever they pay for.  Private jet.  You know?  Well, for him, yeah.  So you'll do a concert with...  You're his onstage DJ.  I've never seen him live.  Yeah, I just press the buttons while he wiggles.  You know what I'm saying? 
[03:51:00]  My favorite...  Candy shop.  My favorite story about Who Kid was...  Because he's a big phony.  He's just doing this to get some celebrities and stuff involved.  He's not like somebody who's perfected his craft and everything.  He used to go up.  Like, he's way too...  He hasn't paid his dues at all.  Like, he's just about trying to get as far ahead as quick as he could.  Without being that professional.  Right.  Sure, understandable.  So he used to take like a 360 like these.  The replay machines that we use.  That's actually how I DJ.  I use those.  The sound machine buttons.  And he'd have songs on the machine. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  And then he told me he put in the record scratching sounds on the machine.  So when you press it, they go, Chirip, Chirip, Chirip, Chirip, first line.  So he's just playing.  So actually...  He's just hitting buttons and DJs like Troy Kwan...  Like Sam could DJ for 50.  ...are trying to get ahead.  Yeah.  It's not a difficult thing to do.  Oh, yeah.  Just press Candy shop.  But you got a good personality.  Yeah.  You got a good onstage persona.  You got charisma.  And I get bitches.  You get bitches.  How did you meet 50 Cent?  They stabbed the first DJ.  And he left town.  Really?  Yeah.  He went to North Carolina. 
[03:52:00]  Who stabbed the first DJ?  Who stabbed him?  I think it was during the Jairo beef.  You remember there was a studio?  I don't know if you guys know the story, but there was a studio.  I guess Jairo turned the light off and then everybody got stabbed up.  But nobody got hurt except the DJ.  This is like a recording studio that you're just renting out.  50 was working in there.  Okay.  And they tried to attack him.  And John, his people came in?  Jairo came in and then only the DJ got hurt.  They turned off the lights and the DJ...  And somebody got...  You don't know who stabbed who.  They stabbed the DJ.  It's probably Jairo... 
[03:52:30]  No, it's probably 50.  It's probably tired of the guys.  So he left town and then I got hired.  Because he got scared.  Yeah.  So you got hired after somebody got stabbed.  Were you at all like...  They gave me a vest.  That's after 50 Cent got shot up.  Right.  Because that's right when he was like, oh shit, this new rapper who got shot nine times  and he's got this beef with Jairoel.  So that's when it was dangerous.  Because right now, it's not dangerous to be 50 Cent anymore.  No, it's not.  You know, he's with Manny Pacquiao.  I don't know how...  Maybe he's dangerous with Floyd Mayweather, but...  Right.  He's a businessman.  50 Cent is an entrepreneur.  He's a smart guy, man.  He's a really, he's a genius. 
[03:53:00]  But back then...  He's with Manny Pacquiao now.  That's weird.  Back then, it must have been a risk for you...  Yeah.  ...to be chilling with this guy who just got his last DJ stabbed.  He just got over being shot up nine times.  You don't know what his beefs are.  But we had Uzis.  We had everything.  You really walked around with firearms.  Not me, but they did.  I was a pussy.  You know what I'm saying?  Come on, man.  He had people, though.  I went to Catholic school for Christ's sakes.  You felt secure.  I was good, you know?  But you had to wear a vest.  I had vests.  I had the white...  What was it?  The ninth level?  The one that the detectives have?  Really?  Six.  I forgot which level it is, but it stops armor-piercing bullets. 
[03:53:30]  And you weren't scared when you were walking around?  You're like, oh, shit.  I just took it.  No, I was with 50 Cent.  So you're like, yeah!  Let's party!  I was chilling, man.  You're like, fuck, I gotta learn how to DJ.  First DJ was a pussy, man.  So how did you get the gig, then?  Oh, my cousin was managing 50, so it was just like, he's your cousin, he's the DJ.  Yo, my cousin DJs.  Because he just got shot up, so they weren't interviewing DJs.  Oh, I got you.  It was like, he's the DJ, get him.  Plus, Get Rich or Die trying hadn't come out yet. 
[03:54:00]  No, I was about to.  We had only one song, which was P.I.M.P.  So he wasn't a big, famous dude yet.  He was getting there.  He had this buzz, this street buzz.  I like that.  You know the black words.  Of course.  But it was before, what's it called?  The big single came out.  In the Club, yeah.  That was the big single.  Yeah, that was it.  It was over.  Were you on that one?  Yeah, I actually DJed the video with Dr. Dre.  Eminem was in there.  You were in the video?  Yeah.  Come on, I'm a DJ.  You know, Who Kid's on 50 Cent's Cribs? 
[03:54:30]  When MTV reruns, it's so funny.  MTV reruns Cribs every now and then.  And it's like an old one.  Mike Tyson's house, actually.  And Who Kid is on there, and he's like, yo, this is my room.  He takes the couch cushion off the couch and shows where he keeps his medallions and stuff  like that.  His big chains.  Who Kid?  Yeah.  Wow.  Put the Kato Kaelin of 50 Cent's Life.  Did you really have your own room there, or was it just like 50 was like, they're filming  Cribs?  No, we all had our own room, but I couldn't show my room because my room got naked photos 
[03:55:00]  of bitches in there.  Oh, that wasn't short.  And I had a waterfall in my room.  What are you, 15?  Like, you had naked Playboy pictures on your room?  I mean, shit, man.  What else did I do there?  I mean, fuck bitches, man.  You had a waterfall in your room?  Oh, they were pictures you took.  Yeah, it was Mike Tyson's crib.  Oh, I thought you meant like you tore pictures out of a magazine and put-  Nah, nah.  I was like, what are you?  I was like, what are you?  It's just a bang, yo.  You took pictures from all of them?  We couldn't put it on MTV, so-  I would never want to see them on my wall.  I'm done with them.  I'm done with them.  I want to look up and see pictures of me with Sabbath.  Yeah.  See some awful chick I fucked.  You just fucked a girl, and you're like, oh, I'm done with that. 
[03:55:30]  And you look up and see Ozzy.  Yeah.  Thank God he's there.  Exactly.  Got to look at her mopey face.  Yeah.  I can't believe I never got like an STD, all the bitches I fucked.  You never- do you fuck with a condom?  Uh, you know.  Do you?  Why would you?  Jim doesn't.  Jim and Anthony both.  Jim don't, man.  What happened?  I know you're trying to be a little politically correct right now, because Jim and Anthony both  are very anti-condom.  I don't believe in them.  Oh, for real?  Yes.  Wait till you hear this.  Well, he survived the 70s.  There was no condoms back then.  I was just getting laid in the 70s.  Oh, you were? 
[03:56:00]  I'm 44, yeah.  Jim has gone to- I don't know how old you think Jim is.  Jim has gone to Brazil.  My age.  You know Brazil?  Yeah.  He's gone to Brazil-  You ain't gonna fuck Roy there, dude.  He's fucked prostitutes without a condom in Brazil.  I only did it twice.  It was the same girl two days in a row.  I only did it twice.  I was fucking her with no bag, and she kept going, you're special.  You're special.  Did you come quick?  I don't remember.  I was taking 100 milligram Viagras.  I don't know if I came at all.  Damn.  It was hard to come on 100 milligrams.  I gotta take a picture with this guy.  Do you take Viagras?  Nah, I never did that.  I have a big dick, man. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah, but you know, some people just take Viagras, you know, just for fun.  Yeah, that's what the beauty of Viagra makes it bigger.  It fills it out to its potential.  I'm a nigga, man.  I don't need any bigger than that, man.  Yeah?  It's a big dick, man.  You know what I mean?  You ever, uh, you know, Jim, this is my other favorite sex story with Jim, he pulled  a train on a girl with Ron Jeremy.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's true.  I never fucked with Ron Jeremy before.  Did you ever fuck with 50 Cent is the question.  Uh, yeah.  You and 50 Cent have fucked a girl at the same time?  I mean, not at the same time. 
[03:57:00]  I had to leave the room, but you know.  Oh, okay.  You took turns.  I mean, it's like tour first, beginning tour stories.  Like, he fucked a girl at the same time while Ron Jeremy was doing it.  Well, I didn't fuck her.  Ron Jeremy, son?  That's a legend idea.  Right.  It's the legendary dirty dick.  So you and 50 Cent took turns, though?  Nah, I left the room.  And I gave her the girl.  I'm showing who hid the proof.  Yo, this guy is the man, yo.  What picture is that?  Yo, I love this guy.  Yo, you are my hero, man.  Have you never seen this?  No.  Fuck the world, man.  Let me see this.  I don't care about Dr. Dre anymore. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, my God.  I don't even care about Jesus Christ.  Who took the picture?  Yo, I do not give a fuck.  He's the man.  He's the man.  He was taken by Dennis Hoff, who owns the Bunny Ranch.  He was in the Venetian.  And I was fucking...  Ron was actually fucking her.  He's got his shirt.  Dennis Hoff.  And he's got sweats.  But his dick is in her, because I was watching them fuck.  And then Ron says to me...  And I've told this story on stage.  You're going to get dick sucked.  That's hot.  And Ron goes, hey, man.  She looks like she needs a cock in her mouth.  And Ron loves that I used to do that bit.  That's hot.  But she blew me for a couple of minutes. 
[03:58:00]  I couldn't come, because it was too weird.  Because Dennis had a girl there.  He was eating her pussy on a table.  Oh, my God.  It was so dirty.  That's why Dennis Hoff loves you so much when he comes in here.  I love Dennis, man.  I wish we had him on more, because he's a fuck...  Every time you hang with him and Ron, and I've hung with him a lot, there's always chicks around.  That's my homeboy.  Talking about the Bunny Ranch.  I love Dennis.  Is that your favorite celebrity picture?  No.  No, no, no, no.  Me and Sabbath is my favorite picture.  Yeah, but it's not like you performing with Sabbath.  That's you with Ron Jeremy both doing what Ron Jeremy is known for doing. 
[03:58:30]  No, you're right.  But, I mean, Sabbath is a harder one to get.  Anyone with a cock can pull a train with Ron Jeremy.  If you provide a girl, and you say, hey, Ron, she's going to blow me while you fuck her, Ron's on board.  Ron's a piece of shit, believe me.  He's not hard to pull a train with.  No.  He doesn't care.  I can't believe you're an orgy with Ron Jeremy, man.  Yeah.  Did you just walk into the hotel room and that was happening?  I hosted the award show that night.  That was the AVNs?  That was with me and Jenna hosted.  That was January of 2004. 
[03:59:00]  That's the first time I met Tyson.  That's where my picture of Tyson came from earlier that day.  So, I go upstairs and I wasn't getting any pussy at all.  So, I walk in.  Dennis was my friend back then.  So, I walked into his room and he goes, hey, come on up, man.  Me and Ronnie are hanging out.  And there was like three Bunny Ranch girls.  I'm just watching Ron fuck one on the bed.  Dennis is eating one's pussy on a table.  Nice.  And I'm just kind of sitting there.  Ron goes, hey, man.  And then he goes, I think she needs a cock in her mouth.  So, I had to do it.  You had to do it.  Of course.  Fuck that.  I fucking had to.  You cool, boy.  Any experiences like that. 
[03:59:30]  Not even close.  I've been through that a lot.  You have?  I was supposed to DJ the Bunny Ranch thing on the TV show.  I'm mad I didn't go because I would have had my dick in her mouth.  You would have.  I would have had that photo.  Have you ever fucked a girl with another guy at the same time?  No, like 10 guys, 20 guys.  And one girl?  Like a G editor.  Yeah?  Everybody does that.  You all just get in the same room and just.  That one time Nelly came in.  I was like, yo, what the fuck?  You fucked a girl with Nelly at the same time?  Fuck who was in that shit?  He was like, nah.  Nah.  There was a weird song he was making, too. 
[04:00:00]  He was like, nah.  Christ almighty.  Who kid?  With Nelly?  From the St. Lunatics?  He was like, nah.  Nah.  Was it getting hot in there?  Yeah, it was hot like a motherfucker.  But the lights is off, so you don't have to look at other people's wee-wees.  Did you ever cross swords?  Banging the girl.  Will you ever touch?  I'll be right back.  All right.  You getting your photo?  Yeah.  Okay.  Jim's got a celebrity photo.  He's got to take care of it.  Yeah, that's Cindy Lauper.  She's hot.  I don't even know how you could get any more celebrity photos after you got that one of you and Ron  Jeremy fucking a girl at the same time.  Yeah, I wouldn't even care anymore. 
[04:00:30]  This is what I was telling you.  This is why you got to get Jim on your show.  Yeah, I'm good.  Jim, he has the wildest stuff.  I thought I had some wild shit, man.  But he's doing it.  It's funny, because I was talking to Troy Kwan.  You know Troy.  I was talking to him about girls, and he used to be in a band.  He used to be a rapper, and he told some crazy sex stories himself, and he was saying  that he was DP-ing a girl once, him and another guy.  He was in her ass, and the other guy was in her pussy.  Yeah.  They rubbed balls.  Like, their ball sacks rubbed against each other. 
[04:01:00]  That's kind of weird.  And then he was like, I'm out, dude.  I don't know.  He couldn't finish after that.  When you're in a room, though, who kid?  And you've got ten guys.  You've got eight guys from G-Unit.  Nelly and you.  That's crazy.  And you're all banging one chick.  Somebody's wife.  Somebody's wife.  And somebody's wife.  It's usually...  Whose wife was it?  Nah, it's usually some random groupie wife chick.  She just wants to have an experience of fucking ten guys.  Oh my God.  So some guy probably took his wife to the show.  See, we've had husbands pick up their wives from the hotel. 
[04:01:30]  His wife got into the hotel, but he didn't.  He didn't even know, but I guess she didn't tell him.  She said she was getting an autograph in her mouth.  In her mouth.  Yeah, yeah.  From Nelly and Hooket and eight members of G-Unit.  He was like...  But you're telling me, when you're giving those oral autographs, no penises touch each other?  Nah.  How can you guys be that organized?  I don't understand.  It's like somebody's getting...  Just like, you know, you heard from...  He said he was getting ahead.  Right. 
[04:02:00]  And Ron was in, you know, fuck, that's how it is.  Somebody gets ahead and somebody gets...  So none of the asshole vagina stuff?  Nah, we don't do the DP.  Because that's too close.  No DPing and all that.  And what, eight other guys hanging around and watch?  That's kind of non-hip-hop.  We don't let the wee-wees rub.  Very homophobic hip-hop.  Yeah, wee-wee rub.  Very avoidant of anything sort of homosexual at all.  Yeah, a lot of hip-hop guys won't...  But I got my picture with the...  With who?  It's not quite like the video.  With Cindy Lauper?  Let me see her face.  No, I'm just cute, right?  She's mad cute, right? 
[04:02:30]  God, man, come on.  Would you fuck Cindy Lauper?  Hell yeah.  Yeah, you would.  You would.  Yo, that's a legend right there.  Yeah.  Girls just wanna have fun?  Come on.  Yeah, you'd have to.  You wouldn't, Jim?  Is that a video?  No, you wouldn't.  You should love her more than anything.  What about...  With that wrestling guy that's in the video.  Captain Lou Arbano.  Come on, man.  What about She-bop?  The whole song's about masturbation.  I love that song, too.  You love that?  She-bop, she...  Wait, alright, so let me get this straight.  Double penetration is not hip-hop, but going on the radio and singing She-bop. 
[04:03:00]  That's hip-hop.  That's hip-hop for me.  That's you and your Notorious B.I.G. shirt, and you're singing She-bop.  Yo, man.  Hey, you ever fuck a tranny?  I'd be duh.  I wouldn't know.  Who gets like, what?  Not voluntarily.  Unless somebody's got a surprise for me.  We have guys like, you know, not artists, but like guys on our team, they fuck trannies  by mistake.  Like, they didn't know it was a tranny.  By accident?  Yeah.  Would they fuck them in the ass? 
[04:03:30]  They get a head from them.  Oh.  So they said it was a mistake.  Understandable.  Do you think in your experience, Jim, that it's actually a mistake?  He's looking at me like, you naive.  You fucked a tranny before?  Who hasn't?  What am I fucking Russian?  Of course I have.  Jim is weird, too.  You know, Jim went through this weird stage where I did a couple trips with him, and we  went to Vegas, and he was like, we should go to a tranny bar just for the goof.  And I was like, okay, yeah, that could be funny.  We'll bring Bob Kelly.  He was with us.  And we just didn't get out there.  And then like the next week after that, we went to San Diego for Comic-Con. 
[04:04:00]  And he was like, oh, I wonder if there's a tranny bar around here.  We should go for a goof.  I was like, okay, yeah.  Both of us go.  We're looking for a tranny bar.  We'll bring it to the show.  Oh, okay.  We didn't end up going to a tranny bar.  Where it gets weird is he came to the show after that.  He announced it on the air that he went to a tranny bar by himself when he got back to New York.  Well, I'll tell you, I would rather have gone with him.  I lasted about 20 minutes.  And I was bored there.  It didn't gross me out. 
[04:04:30]  It wasn't creepy.  I just got bored.  It didn't turn you on at all?  It honestly did not.  No.  I would tell you if it did.  I would have no keep trannies in it.  There was a couple of good-looking ones.  But it just didn't feel sexual at all.  It just felt like I was observing something.  Again, not crazy or gross or yuck.  But just it didn't turn me on or off.  I just felt very neutral watching it.  And I got bored.  I got a couple lap dances.  It didn't feel sexy.  It didn't feel disgusting.  It just felt, again, very neutral. 
[04:05:00]  And I lost my wallet there.  I told the story on Fallon.  I lost my wallet at a tranny bar.  I had to fucking call back and go.  I lost.  The guy actually walked into the lap dance room with me.  He's looking under the couch.  And I got it back, though.  He's very experimental, this guy.  Very experimental.  That's why.  It was like, okay, he's going by himself.  Curiosity.com.  You got that camera, Iraq, for our Garfunkel?  Yep.  I love you.  Who that we might know from G-Unit accidentally fucked a tranny?  It's accidents.  It's all right.  It was my mistake.  But who that we might know is one of these people? 
[04:05:30]  Because G-Unit, you know, he got.  I mean, dated from the back.  Young Buck.  You know, Lloyd Banks.  Nah.  You know.  I met Lloyd Banks.  Bentley Benzer Beamer.  Nah, nah.  They got bitches.  No, it wasn't them.  Nah, nah.  It wasn't them.  Was it Busta?  Isn't he a member of G-Unit now?  Ooh, Busta Rhymes?  Yeah.  Nah, he's with Lil Wayne.  Oh, that's right.  He slept with a tranny by mistake.  He did.  Busta Rhymes definitely did.  No, not Busta Rhymes.  Lil Wayne, man.  Oh.  Oh.  Didn't Chingy, too, or did he not do it?  No, Chingy loves tranny, so he loves it.  Well, I've heard that he had to come out and go, no. 
[04:06:00]  I heard he had to come out and say he does not.  Oh, he did?  Didn't he do a video?  I know nothing about...  Here's what I know about...  What was Chingy's song, right there?  I wouldn't know.  He wanted it right there.  Here's what I know about Chingy.  At AVN one year, he was on stage.  He was like the performer.  Like the year...  One of the first year I hosted it, Lil Jon was the singer and the song.  And...  Oh, so you were there.  I've done it twice.  I've hosted it, but not when Chingy was there.  Oh, okay.  But one year, he was on stage dancing and dancing with a tranny named Vanity.  Yeah. 
[04:06:30]  But...  Chingy was.  Or she was around him.  I don't know if he was specifically dancing with her.  And I think it came out like he was angry because they said that he didn't know she  was a transsexual.  She's pretty passable.  Wow.  Right.  But you're telling me, Hooky, that Chingy does indeed enjoy transvestites.  Transsexuals are different, Sam.  Oh, transsexuals.  He likes transsexuals.  They're different.  Oh, I don't know the difference.  Transsexuals are ladies.  Transvestites are men in a dress, which, in my opinion, makes you a silly goose.  Transsexuals are just a lady.  But Lil Wayne is all about the tranny. 
[04:07:00]  Well, there's a tranny that said she slept with him.  And you believe that to be true?  Yeah, she had the operation, though.  Well, he cut his dick off.  Oh, she's post-op?  Yeah.  Oh, what's the use?  You don't like that, Jim.  Just get a chick, for Christ's sake.  Right.  It's not naughty anymore.  What happened to the naughtiness?  Exactly.  I don't want a fake cunt.  Yeah.  Can you do that?  How do they do that?  You'd rather have a fake dick than a fake cunt.  I like a chick with a strap on, yeah.  Okay.  A chick with a strap on is blood.  You ever take a strap on, Hooky?  Nah.  No.  No, he never took a strap on.  I've tried.  You think Chingy did? 
[04:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, you think so?  You think so?  We had a lot of porno stars or strippers that's been on our show, and they've used strap  ons on a lot of rappers and actors.  I think a lot of rappers are on the fucking DL, but they can't talk about it.  So, who have they said they used strap ons on?  A lot of football players, actors.  Yeah, fair enough.  The major ones out there, too.  And these guys can't say it.  I'm dying to get a strap on properly, just because it's dirty.  I don't even like the way it feels, necessarily. 
[04:08:00]  I've tried it.  It hurt.  It didn't feel great.  But it's the idea of a chick.  Like, when my ex would put one on, the way the strap on held around her ass.  Sam looked so confused.  Yeah, no.  It looked dirty.  I'm relating.  It looked dirty, but a lot of people won't.  But guys who have done it understand it.  You don't feel like it's a guy.  It doesn't feel masculine at all.  It's dirty and feminine.  That's what was hot about it.  It's obscene.  I also think that you're on a different level of dirtiness.  Like a child, you've spoiled yourself to the extent that when you want to get dirty, 
[04:08:30]  you need to get to this next level of dirtiness.  Maybe, maybe, but that was one I was never quite able to achieve.  It made me feel like I had to shit.  Yeah, I would think so.  Like, you know, when a doctor shoves his finger up your ass, you kind of feel like you got to shit.  Yeah, a lot.  When it's a finger that's the size of a dick, you probably have to shit a whole bunch more.  That's why I was mad at my doctor there, because he was checking my colon.  Today?  No, no.  Like last week, he made me go to the side.  Like, I had to put my pants down.  Lay on your side, right?  So, yeah.  He's like, I got to look at your butt. 
[04:09:00]  Did he put it in a couple times?  Did he go in and out, in and out?  He put the big thumb.  He put his thumb in?  Yeah.  He looked like he was enjoying it?  I didn't like it at all.  Did he just...  Go ahead.  No, I was going to say, when he had his finger in and it was hurting, did he say, now you're  going to pay on time this time, aren't you?  I'm a nigga.  You know I ain't paying.  See, we're deeper.  It was a disciplinary action.  I wonder how many of your fans slept with a tranny by mistake.  I don't think a lot of them.  You don't think so?  I don't think a lot of them, because Jim has told his tranny stories on the air many  times.  And nobody...  Everybody's scared to call up and tell them their tranny stories? 
[04:09:30]  We haven't heard from a lot of people saying that they also slept with a tranny.  Yeah, you'll hear a lot of, I'm just going through this world alone.  Yeah, I mean...  Well, I think the average human being just doesn't experience themselves where they would  be in a position where they would accidentally sleep with a tranny.  Like, most people are not, you know, sex addicts.  Yeah.  They're not sex addicts.  They're not, you know, hip-hop crews on the road.  Like, these things don't happen.  They just are lucky to meet a girl at some point.  That's crazy. 
[04:10:00]  Like, that's just life.  You know, like, for instance, who can...  They get married, and they just sleep with their wife.  That's weird.  You don't understand that at concert at all.  That's some stupid shit.  It sounds stupid to me, too.  I got my bitch pregnant.  That's why I got hooked.  Right.  There was no love or nothing like that.  You got your wife pregnant.  You have to get married after that.  And then while she's pregnant, you're fucking other bitches.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I think I was with Khalees at that time, but yeah.  You fucked Khalees while your wife was pregnant.  I was kissing and talking to them.  Who's Khalees? 
[04:10:30]  That's Nas's ex-wife.  Uh, yeah.  How did Nas know that you fucked Khalees while your wife was pregnant?  I don't know.  He probably does now.  I really, I have to tell you, I really hope that World Star Hip Hop has been listening  to this show, or somebody can contact them, because Puket has been very vocal today on  the program.  Jim, yo, Jim is crazy, man.  Jim is crazy.  He's still the man with that photo, though.  He is the man.  I need that photo on my wall.  Have you ever seen anything like that in hip hop?  Like, that's your new role model, kids. 
[04:11:00]  That's it, man.  You already, you got people calling in with their training stories, right?  Yeah, but we only got a couple minutes.  Only one phone line right now.  Yeah, and I don't even know if I can call this guy.  It's a guy.  Who is it?  Let me see.  Uh, hey, you're on the air.  Yeah, you see what I mean?  He's already not even prepared.  I'm not even gonna, I don't have to push this.  No, you don't give him no time.  No, because the three of us can handle this, who kid?  Okay.  You know, there's three professionals in here.  I'm a viral video all-star.  Sure.  Half a million views on YouTube.  Wow.  Less than.  You're the man, son. 
[04:11:30]  It's not even 48 hours, Hoop.  Damn.  Damn, man.  Not even 48 hours.  Who's ass is that?  That's right.  That's nice.  Who's ass is that?  That's a nice rump on your phone.  Oh, this is one of my sex tapes on my phone.  You have, that's true.  Who kid has shown me multiple tapes of different porn stars that he fucks?  Oh, he bangs a lot of them, huh?  He bangs a lot of porn stars.  Up and down, up and down, up and down.  Are you gonna make me horny?  Can you drop a name on who that was with?  Now, by the way, why is the light so low? 
[04:12:00]  What were you shooting at?  No, no, no.  She didn't know I was filming her.  That's why.  Oh, smart guy.  This is one of those don't know what's going on.  He's got a lot.  I've seen multiple, like.  I always have him work out before I fuck him.  Who kid is a guy that talks a lot of shit, so half the time he's lying because he's joking.  This is with porn.  But then he'll pull out some videos.  That was just girls dancing?  That, uh, these bitches are fucked.  I'm gonna tell you something.  There is enough. 
[04:12:30]  They're hot.  There is enough on Who Kid's phone to terrify Anthony.  Anthony would want Who Kid arrested.  Piper?  If he found his phone.  Piper Parabo.  Who's Piper?  She's on one of Stupid Roland's USA shows.  She popped on a camera.  She's in Coyote Ugly.  No.  Who cares?  I love you, Rock.  He's just helping me.  Will you come with me?  Can you make love?  Yeah, of course.  I got too much shit in here.  Yeah, you got some.  Did your wife ever look at your phone?  Nah.  No.  Is that why you got the fuck off case?  This case just says fuck off.  Do you have a password on it?  Do you have a password?  Yeah. 
[04:13:00]  My password is don't touch, bitch.  Your wife has to know that you're cheating, though.  Yeah, I don't care.  But just not to the extent.  Yeah, I cheat.  Yeah, but she doesn't know that you're cheating, like, constantly.  Like, you're just fucking bitches everywhere.  I cheat at intervals, you know?  Like, when I'm working here, I don't do shit.  When I go overseas, you know, I stick my dick.  Overseas or, you know.  Here and there, you know what I'm saying?  Las Vegas.  I mean, Las Vegas is not overseas.  No trannies, though, but, you know.  I got you.  Not yet.  You'll work your way up.  Yeah, well, eventually they're an acquired taste.  You know, that's kind of fucked up. 
[04:13:30]  He said that.  You probably slept with a tranny didn't know either, Sam.  I never slept with any tranny, no.  How do you know that?  Because I've checked for vaginas every time.  Why do you have to check, though?  You're not supposed to be checking people.  Exactly.  Doctor, how rude are you?  I see.  I see genitals that are internal, not external.  That's how I know.  Does it look plasticky?  No, it doesn't look plasticky.  It's the real deal.  We got to go.  We got to make room for Ron and Fez.  Jim, good luck with your photos.  I'll get them.  Thank you.  I'm looking forward to it.  Sidney Lauper's hot, son. 
[04:14:00]  I'll get it.  It's always a pleasure.  Why don't you go try to get in that?  I'm going to get in between that.  Cheeks.  I've had the chance for 40 minutes.  Well, I'm glad we held you captive.  Yeah, this is, no, I'm just waiting for Art Garfunkel.  He is a legend.  Okay.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Waiting for an iPhone, waiting in line for an iPhone for no reason is the video, and we'll  see you tomorrow.  Okay.  Goodbye.  The Lopey and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com.  And catch O&A live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern. 
[04:14:30]  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  Hey! </pre>
