<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with promotions for their "ON A Traveling Virus Comedy Show" on August 2nd, featuring Patrice O'Neal, Opie, Bobby Kelly, Voss, Otto, George, three unannounced comedians, and a major surprise guest. Opie shared anecdotes about George Carlin and Sam Kinison.  High Boston ratings were announced, along with a cryptic "red alert" for Monday.  Anthony detailed his experience at a Wall Street party for Fox Business' "Bulls and Bears" (later corrected by a caller), describing the event, his Armani suit (obtained through his contacts), a meeting with the Cowboy from the Village People, and the attendees' nostalgic reactions to their "Stockbroker Dave" segments, including the infamous vasectomy bit.  They discussed Rebecca Gomez, a reporter from the show, and planned to post her picture online. The conversation transitioned to their dislike of NYC's temporary waterfall art installation, contrasting it with the "Gates" installation.  They reminisced about Shea Stadium, sharing humorous and unpleasant memories, including Opie's childhood bathroom experience and an accidental hand-holding incident.  They satirized CW11's sentimental Shea Stadium coverage, mentioning Jill Nicolini. Danny recounted his first acid trip at Shea Stadium. The demolition of Shea and Yankee Stadiums, and the controversy surrounding Monument Park, were discussed. E-Rock's job loss following a controversial UK commercial was briefly mentioned, with Opie and Anthony offering differing perspectives. The segment concluded with more comedy show announcements, a plea to Boston Mayor Menino, and an in-studio appearance by Louis C.K., who discussed his stand-up show, divorce, and the benefits of mediation over adversarial legal battles, especially concerning children.

The show continued with a caller discussing their frustrating divorce trial experience compared to the efficiency of mediation, including a humorous anecdote about the mediator falling asleep.  The high US divorce rate was mentioned.  A news story about a mother whose daughter had a "massive" bathroom accident in a mall and was denied assistance sparked strong negative opinions from the hosts regarding the mother's responsibility.  The store owner's receipt of death threats was also discussed. Louis C.K. returned to the studio, and the hosts promoted their comedy show and revisited their long-standing feud with Mayor Menino, playing a recording of their insincere apology.  They discussed challenges in maintaining positive relationships while addressing grievances, focusing on the lack of "equity" in emotional accounts, illustrated by listener calls and personal anecdotes. The "FU Line" segment followed, featuring angry listener calls. Movie trailers and a news story about teenagers' crime spree allegedly inspired by Grand Theft Auto were discussed, along with the hosts' differing opinions on the game.

The next segment began with a discussion on video game violence, specifically Grand Theft Auto, the "hot coffee" incident, and related lawsuits.  Big A’s on-air prostate exam with Dr. Steve was humorously recounted, emphasizing the awkwardness and FCC compliance efforts.  Opie discussed his brother's extensive surgeries and his own health struggles. The Supreme Court's decision to overturn Washington D.C.’s handgun ban and its contrasting ruling against the death penalty for child rapists were debated, touching upon gun control, the Second Amendment, and gun ownership responsibilities.  A highly explicit and humorous exchange followed, featuring audio of Eastside Dave’s vulgar attack on Louis C.K. from the Ron and Fez show, followed by Louis C.K.’s surprisingly apologetic response. Club Soda Kenny provided the "Daily Dump Report."

A subsequent segment addressed the surcharges on their comedy show tickets. Louis C.K.'s State Theater performance was mentioned.  Audience interaction followed, featuring offensive jokes about Christopher Reeve, awkward conversations about butt touching, and discussions about ethnicity and accents.  Pat Duffy's unexpected celebrity status was discussed.  Sam Roberts proposed a videotaping segment for the website.  A vulgar exchange with a Canadian caller (Eve/Yves) and Louis C.K. ensued. A Widespread Panic bus driver called in.  A sexually suggestive and inappropriate conversation about Vinnie Brand's daughter ensued, including details about her family life and her father's intimidating behavior.  A conversation with Pat Duffy's high school teacher followed, including a bizarre story about a class project. The segment ended with a call from “Stalker Patty,” who shared disturbing accounts of childhood sexual abuse.

The final segment featured a caller, Patty, recounting graphic details of childhood sexual abuse by her father and brother, including descriptions of neglect and emotional abuse from her foster parents, and an abandonment incident as an infant.  E-Rock's attempt to tell jokes to fill time was unsuccessful, resulting in him sharing a personal anecdote about confronting his abusive grandmother.  The segment concluded with an announcement of Patty's upcoming hypnotism session and the "Line of the Day" segment, which largely centered on Patty's story.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  It's Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  You know what I like to say? T-G-I-F.  T-A!  Of course. Of course.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Greetings. 
[00:00:30]  We've got so much O.N.A. news, it's not even funny.  Oh my God.  Where do we begin?  Where do we begin?  We've got lawn tickets going on sale today at 9 a.m. for our O.N.A. Traveling Virus Comedy Show.  August 2nd at the PNC Arts Center in Homedale, New Jersey.  Still putting the lineup together, but who do we have so far, Jimmy?  So far we've got some of the ones from last year.  It'll be Patrice O'Neal, myself, Bobby Kelly, Voss, Otto, and George.  There are going to be some different comedians as well. 
[00:01:00]  The only reason I can't announce them right now is to confirm like three more people.  I don't want to announce them and then douche people if they don't know.  We're going to confirm at least three more people.  And also, we're going to have a huge surprise guest that we're not even going to announce.  You're just going to be sitting in the audience and you're going to go,  Wow, who saw that coming?  Really?  And they'll be very, very happy.  Yes.  It's Carlin.  That would be a surprise.  It's the only way we would get him.  I miss that mother effer. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  It was a rough one.  We weren't even on the air when he passed, Jimmy.  And you had some nice memories of George Carlin because you got to do a skit with him on Tough Crowd.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Yeah, I got to do it.  Oh, immortalized in a skit.  Yeah, I got to do a sketch with him.  We did three.  We did a panel together and also a sketch where he played a...  Him and Colin were playing Priest and I had to break the fourth wall and walk in with an album dressed like an altar boy and ask him to sign it.  Yeah.  And Carlin cursed at me on camera.  It was great.  That's good. 
[00:02:00]  They beeped it.  Yeah, it was really nice, man.  I love Colin for that.  I'm going to get my picture with George Carlin framed and he's going up on my wall.  Not many people go up on my wall.  Every celebrity picture Jimmy takes goes up on his wall.  You don't even know what color his walls are in his apartment because it's covered with celebrity pictures.  It doesn't matter how small a celebrity or how large they will be up on his wall.  I'm extremely selective.  The George Carlin picture is going to go right next to the picture of me and Sam Kinison. 
[00:02:30]  Ooh.  And that's the only comedians on my wall.  And that was Lil Opie.  With acid washed jeans.  That's how long ago it was.  You make Opie's wall, you're in trouble.  Yeah, that's what it means.  No one's doing well on your wall.  No, no.  Opie's wall's a memoriam.  It kind of is.  In memoriam.  It kind of is because I got a Pete Maravich autograph.  I got a Kurt Cobain supposed autograph.  Phony. 
[00:03:00]  Phony.  I don't know if it's phony.  Yeah.  The one that Dr. Steve gave me I believe is real because Dr. Steve, you know, he's not a phony.  No.  Another fan gave me a Kurt Cobain, you know, autograph and I was like, oh boy.  Phony.  How much did you pay for this?  This one is.  You got robbed.  Yeah.  That one's over at Exxon if someone wants to grab it.  Kurt, a spell with a C.  Right.  It didn't make the wall.  No, it did not make the wall.  So we got lawn tickets going on sale at 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster. 
[00:03:30]  Only 1,000 lawn tickets.  And then you got to pay full price for this fine comedy show we're doing August 2nd.  And then we got to say good morning to Boston because.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  We had really, really, really good ratings in Boston.  A little ratings trend came out yesterday and we did very well.  So I want to acknowledge all the people listening in Boston this morning.  Thank you, Boston.  Thank you, Boston.  And then finally, because people are very, very confused, we went into red alert mode yesterday, Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, the speculation.  Oh, the speculation.  The red alert thing has something to do with the Opie and Anthony show.  Of course.  And I can tell you this much.  As we continue with the red alert, Monday is an important day for the Opie and Anthony show.  And that's all we can say right now.  Yeah.  Okay?  That's it.  Deal with it.  Speculate.  Speculate.  Speculate.  Copy, paste.  Copy, paste.  So focus.  Blind seats.  Blind seats.  The whole red alert has everything to do with the radio show that a lot of people know and love. 
[00:04:30]  Okay?  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Anthony, you went down to Wall Street yesterday?  Yes.  Yeah?  Yes.  Apparently, Fox Financial Network has a show.  And they were celebrating.  It's like some kind of party atmosphere type show thing.  They talk about stocks.  Well, the one in the bar? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the one that's like in a bar.  Yeah.  They have some young financial whiz sitting in a bar after the market closes.  I guess it's supposed to have all the Wall Street guys sitting around having a cocktail.  Yeah, you know, after Wall Street, you know, after you're done on Wall Street, you're going to hit the bar.  Does it look real?  Yeah.  It's in a bar.  It's in a bar.  Yeah, it's actually in a bar.  It's actually in a bar.  Pretty awful.  Yeah.  Nobody watches it.  Oh, gee.  How could they?  That sounds terrible.  Well, it's on the Fox Financial channel, you know. 
[00:05:30]  I thought that's not a big channel.  You know, not every cable outlet gets it.  Recently, one of these networks wanted you and I for an interview.  That was the one.  Oh, it was?  Yeah.  Because it's always interesting when they say, hey, Fox wants to talk to you and Anthony.  But then you look a little deeper.  It's like Fox Financial Network News Channel. 
[00:06:00]  Which Fox?  It's like a deep version of Fox.  Is it Network Fox or is it Fox News Channel or is it?  It's Fox Business Channel.  Fox Business Channel.  What the hell is that?  So we passed.  Yeah.  We said no thank you to Fox Business Channel.  What's the show called?  Fox Business Happy Hour.  Happy Hour.  Fox Business Happy Hour.  Fox Business Happy Hour.  And people come on and talk about stocks.  Yeah.  So they were having a big party.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Outside Wall Street yesterday.  They cordoned off the area.  They had a band.  And there were a lot of reporters down there.  A lot of anchor people.  Things like that.  A lot of fans.  Holy Jesus.  People that work all the cameras and everything.  Tech guys.  Wall Street guys.  They were all bringing up Stockbroker Dave.  They remember all those bits.  Stockbroker Dave got a vasectomy.  Oh yeah. 
[00:07:00]  Live on our show.  Oh yeah.  And took the tube that they cut out and brought it back to the station.  We put it on a Ritz cracker and made someone eat it for some lousy concert tickets.  I can tell you because I'm Rain Man.  Yes of course.  What tickets were they?  Aerosmith tickets.  Aerosmith.  Yes.  And someone ate his tube that they cut out during the vasectomy.  Stunt Brain that one was true too.  Oh my god.  Yeah.  Cannibalism on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:07:30]  You're hearing a new voice like kind of in the background.  His name is Stunt Brain.  We hate his nickname but he really helps the radio show.  And he's been in New York radio for how many years?  20 years.  20 years.  So he's heard the story so now my new thing is yeah that one's true too Stunt Brain.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  And it was by the way very illegal to take this piece of a human over state lines.  See this is another one of those bits we should have been fired for.  It was in a biohazard bag.  Yeah.  And you're not really allowed to transport that across state lines. 
[00:08:00]  Hazardous human waste.  We did back in the day.  Threw it on a Ritz cracker.  Some listener came in who really liked Aerosmith.  Ate it.  And ate it.  Yes.  We had cannibalism on the Opie and Anthony show.  Stunt Brain.  What was Scott Shannon doing then?  Some dumb fake prank call.  Something wacky.  Yeah.  Of course something wacky.  People do remember that though.  And yeah.  I met a lot of people.  A lot of fans.  Got a lot of where's Opie.  Yeah.  I get a lot of where's Opie when I'm out. 
[00:08:30]  Oh.  Guess what I get.  Where is Anthony?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  But guess what I get.  Who are you?  I laugh really hard because it's true.  Come on, Jimmy.  People love Jimmy.  Of course.  Did they talk about when Stockbroker Dave's money?  Because this is when Wall Street was flourishing and this Stockbroker Dave, who's now destitute. 
[00:09:00]  But back then he wasn't and he would come in with a lot of green.  Yeah.  He'd come in with money.  And he just wanted to see some crazy stuff.  So he would just start peeling them off, man.  Peeling them off.  Peeling them off.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Take the clothes off.  Yeah.  Oh.  Some guy in Kentucky watched it?  Tim, Kentucky.  What's up?  Yeah.  I was watching Fox Business.  The show that you're talking about is Bulls and Bears. 
[00:09:30]  And it's in the bar of the Waldorf Astoria.  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria.  Where is Hakeem?  You better get that clip.  Every time someone mentions Waldorf Astoria, we got to play it.  Oh, you saw it?  Yeah.  And at the end of the show, I guess they were saying their buys or whatever.  And I saw you all, her hugged up with you in your sharp black suit, blue tie, her in  a white coat of dress, I believe it was.  Wow.  But how can she be so brown and you so white to just come back from the Bahamas? 
[00:10:00]  Well, she tans better than I do.  What can I tell you?  I really tried.  I laid out in the sun forever.  But you're Italian.  You should be, you know, bronzing up there.  I guess I...  You're Italian with a bit of the Sicilian, but I guess not enough.  I guess not enough.  You know, when the Moors invaded Sicily.  Sure.  Sure.  Oh, so you were on TV on this Fox Business channel? 
[00:10:30]  Yes.  And boy...  Did you get to talk?  No, I was just kind of hanging out in the background.  Really?  There was, you know, some stuff going on.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was...  And boy...  I'm just...  I'm just a waste as far as...  You look sharp.  Well, yes, that was an Armani suit, my friend.  Oh, you did go get the Armani suit?  I had to get my Armani suit.  I was talking to Anthony after the show yesterday, and he goes, I gotta get a suit.  I want an Armani suit.  Well, I'm past the point of going to friggin', you know, a place and getting some lousy suit. 
[00:11:00]  So, I got a good suit.  Yeah, you look good, I have to admit, but I was just wondering about being so white coming  back from the Bahamas.  Well, I'm gonna have to...  I guess I'm gonna have to go tanning now, so I can keep up with my girlfriend's tan.  I mean, she looked just as good as Rebecca Gomez did, and she was looking hot yesterday.  That's the only reason I really watch the Fox Business Network.  Wait, who's Rebecca Gomez?  Is this someone we should take a look at? 
[00:11:30]  Yes, she was the reporter or the anchor person on that show.  Yeah, she's...  Let me tell you how dumb E-Rock is.  Isn't she on there right now?  Hold on, let me tell you how dumb E-Rock is.  I go, who is this Rebecca Gomez?  So, he highlights Fox Business Happy Hour, Cody Willard, and Rebecca Gomez.  When I mean, who is Rebecca Gomez, and should we take a peek?  I need a picture, not text.  Thread worthless without pictures.  Yes, of course.  And then we take the picture, we put it up on onaradio.com, and everyone plays along at home. 
[00:12:00]  So, Tim, Anthony looked sharp yesterday on TV.  Well, thank you, Tim.  Yes, he did.  But not tan enough.  But not tan enough.  So, I'll have to work on that.  Well, like I said, you know, to come back from a vacation at the Bahamas, Herbie, you know, golden brown,  and you beat pale pasty white, I mean, it's kind of a little bit, you know, tricky.  Well, I'm a little red.  Thank you, Tim.  Thank you.  All right.  But I left.  If you notice, these are the exact clothes I was wearing for this program yesterday. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, I know.  Why don't you pack anything?  You said ahead of time I'm going to be staying in the city, so why don't you pack a little overnight bed?  I have the stuff packed, but it's at Jill's, and we thought we were going to have enough  time for me to go there, but it didn't work out that way.  So, I stayed at the hotel.  You were going to get up at like 2.30 in the morning to go to her place to get new clothes  and come back to the city?  No.  I was going to go after the show yesterday, but we were so pressed for time, and I had 
[00:13:00]  to go get a suit.  But I went in like this, and within an hour, everything was tailored and done.  How long did it take for someone to pay attention to you?  Oh, in seconds.  Not dressed like that.  Not in New York.  Absolutely.  They knew I was coming before.  Phone calls were made.  That's why.  See, this is how, like, players get things done, Opie.  Do not become a player.  When you have advanced phone calls. 
[00:13:30]  Do not become a player.  Stay Anthony Cumia.  Friends helping out that are like the wolf from Pulp Fiction.  Yeah, I understand.  You go in there, things just get done.  Measured, tailored in 20 minutes.  And then just off to Wall Street, where we were hobnobbing with some of the...  But you hate hobnobbing.  You don't like Wall Street.  Well, it's...  You don't like being with people in general. 
[00:14:00]  You don't like staying in the city a minute past the radio show is over.  Well, if I'm staying in town, which I did last night, that I don't mind.  And it was hobnobbing with, you know, the Fox people.  And mostly the behind-the-scenes guys.  Not like the, you know, stuck-up people or anything.  Yeah, Rebecca's pretty hot, actually.  She's all right.  Jill's way hotter, though.  Well, thank you, yes.  Well, just because the guy's comparing Jill to this Rebecca broad. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  This Rebecca broad.  What does celebs...  You said there was going to be, like, celebrity-packed.  Well, there were a few people there that I recognized.  But I can't remember their names.  Oh, one huge celebrity that was there that I got a picture with.  The cowboy guy from the Village People.  He was down there.  Cowboy guy?  Wow.  That wouldn't be Glenn Hughes.  I think Glenn Hughes was...  Was that the guy's name?  Glenn Hughes?  Was he, like, the construction worker?  And then Felipe Rose, I think, was the Indian. 
[00:15:00]  And, of course, Victor Willis was the lead singer.  I don't remember.  By the way, Glenn Hughes.  Glenn Hughes, the only Hughes celebrity I will not admit to.  Oh, that is a relative of yours to being related to.  Because usually any Hughes seems to be a celebrity.  Well, I do have a bit going with the people that listen very closely to this radio show.  But I'm here to say Glenn Hughes is the only Hughes celebrity that I am not related to.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And I do believe that maybe after a couple of glasses of wine, we were singing YMCA together. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Were you?  Look at Jimmy.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  And then we had some gay sex.  Fair enough.  Who was your favorite of the village people?  Mine was the Indian.  I was very intimidated by the construction worker.  I was listening to Zeppelin, Jimmy. 
[00:16:00]  I'm not even going to play this game.  You could do that, too.  And a little Sabbath, actually.  Back in the day.  My dad took me to Cedar Village.  I know.  I know, Jim.  And Sister Sledge was the opening act.  Oh, my God.  How swishy was that concert?  I didn't know.  Why would your dad take it to the village people?  I didn't know that they were all gay.  I had no idea.  Yeah, you were just an innocent little child.  It's not even about that.  It just seems like it's like going to a Broadway show.  Have you heard I Am What I Am?  Or how about perhaps a little Macho Man? 
[00:16:30]  Some wonderful songs.  In the Navy.  Need I remind you?  In the Navy.  They had a live album.  You can sell the seven seas.  In the Navy.  Do your entire tour on your knees.  You can get venereal disease in the Navy.  I should have known you were going to a Broadway show.  Why else would you have sung it?  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:17:00]  And then there were a few other people that I absolutely recognized.  Some, like, you know, players in the business.  In what business?  What is that?  Oh, is that the village people?  Yeah.  Yeah.  In, you know, the media moguls.  And then who else was there?  Media moguls was.  Miss New York was there with her crown.  As was Ms. America.  They broke out all the big celebrities for that. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  Just amazing.  You know how it is.  Larry Pacino.  Right.  Steve De Niro.  Right.  Gary Trump.  The worst celebrity collection.  I know.  He's trying, too.  Well, number one on the list is the guy from the village people.  Well, yeah.  There he is.  And I recognize some of these people, but I don't know their names, and I can't give you  any more info.  All right.  We got to take our first break.  Just getting warmed up.  So the big headline today, let's not forget, lawn tickets for the Traveling Virus 2008 comedy 
[00:18:00]  show, August 2nd at the PNC Bank Art Center in Homedale, New Jersey.  $10 lawn tickets starting at 9 a.m. this morning.  First thousand gets the $10 tickets, and then that's it.  And I believe at this point it's safe to say we're not going to be coming to Boston, unfortunately,  or Philly, unfortunately, for this comedy tour this summer.  I think it's going to be officially one and done, so we're hoping that some of the people  from Boston drive down, some of the people drive up from Philly, you know, and we'll  make it one big summer party on August 2nd. 
[00:18:30]  All right?  Trump's son.  Opie and Anthony.  Now we're talking.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning to everybody.  What do you think of the waterfalls in New York City, Anthony?  Could be the dumbest things ever. 
[00:19:00]  I don't see how this works out.  What is it?  Some kind of art project.  It's not art.  It's stupid.  I got to tell you, almost every New Yorker, especially the ones listening to our show,  they don't want to see waterfalls in New York City.  No.  They just don't.  It's not a waterfall either.  It looks like some big contraption that's used to aerate water at a sewage treatment plant. 
[00:19:30]  It doesn't even look like...  It was probably pitched like,  This is going to be great.  There's going to be these three or four waterfalls right in the East River.  Aren't they supposed to be under the bridges or something?  Yeah, one's under the Brooklyn Bridge.  One's just sitting out in the East River.  The other one's kind of on the Brooklyn side.  And there's giant scaffolding with water pouring over the one side of it.  It doesn't look like a nice waterfall. 
[00:20:00]  You know, waterfalls, you picture coming off of a big stone cliff or something.  This is just some real ugly scaffolding with water being pumped up and pushed over one side.  Yeah, you need some big boulders or something to kind of jazz it up.  I thought the gates were pretty silly, but at least that was in Central Park.  So people that came into New York, they were able to walk through the park and see those things.  This is like...  Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[00:20:30]  I've got to stop you there.  What?  I walked through Central Park when they had the orange gates up.  Yeah.  It was the dumbest thing ever.  Of course it was.  It's tough to kind of critique someone's quote art,  but the gates in Central Park was so ridiculous.  Do we get pictures of that thrown up on onaradio.com?  But it did get revenue because people kind of wanted to come and see them  because it got a lot of press and people...  But it was in Central Park where people would walk... 
[00:21:00]  Right.  ...and take pictures with the gates or whatever the hell they were doing.  This is like yesterday, I'm driving down the FDR and you get an occasional glance  while you're trying not to get hit by a cab.  This isn't something you can really get a good look at.  And why would you?  Didn't you say it looked like a treatment...  Yeah, a sewage treatment plant.  ...sewage treatment plant.  That's exactly what it looks like.  Some aerator.  So, I don't know, once every two years or something they allow these artists 
[00:21:30]  from somewhere else in the world, I believe, I don't know if this is a local artist  on this one, to come up with some really strange art project.  And it's supposed to take New York by storm.  Oh, yeah.  We're supposed to just fall in love with this, quote, art.  Oh, when are they taking them down?  I hope I get to see it before that.  Look at the gates, the orange gates to your right there, Jimmy.  Well, look at that.  What is that?  Remember the gates.  Just orange gates that you were supposed to walk through, and they're not really gates. 
[00:22:00]  They're just like orange sticks with orange fabric that's flowing in between the orange sticks.  It was terrible.  And somehow that's supposed to be a gate.  A gate to what?  What does it mean?  Maybe the artist could explain what this crap means.  Because we're not smart enough, obviously, to figure it out ourselves.  No, we're too stupid.  A gate to one guy, kneeling in front of another guy, doing poppers behind a bush.  That's what happens in Central Park. 
[00:22:30]  Lovely.  There's somewhere to wipe yourself off on the fabric.  Let's say hi to Ron in New York.  A typical New Yorker right here.  Ron, what do you got?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yo, it's so bad on the BQE.  The traffic is ridiculous because there's stupid waterfalls.  Nobody can figure out what it is when you're driving by.  So people are slowing down, so it's causing more traffic, this thing.  Oh, it's atrocious.  It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Ron.  But they got that going on this weekend. 
[00:23:00]  And then the other thing happening in New York, but I think the rest of the country can kind of relate to this.  We're having a subway series here in New York, the Yankees versus the Mets.  And Shea Stadium, which is a crap hole.  I've been a longtime Met fan growing up and stuff.  Shea Stadium has been the worst stadium in the league for 20 years.  Probably 20 years.  It's been the worst stadium in Major League Baseball. 
[00:23:30]  And then you got Yankee Stadium, the house that Ruth built.  Sure.  With all that history and stuff, and that's coming down this year, too.  Both stadiums are basically coming down this year, right?  Staminer just won't let the Mets trump him and get a new stadium.  Huh?  Staminer won't let the Mets trump him and get a new stadium.  Yeah.  But you can't even compare the two stadiums.  You know, being a Met fan, I have to acknowledge, you know, Yankee Stadium, a lot cooler.  Way cooler than Shea Stadium.  Shea Stadium is the house that Ruth Gordon built. 
[00:24:00]  It is a horrible place to see.  Come to the stadium.  To see the Mets play.  Your most friends.  It's just a horrible place.  You know, if you get, like, the bleacher seats, you are ridiculously high at Shea Stadium.  Shea Stadium was kind of like, it didn't have a, it had like a white socks, like a big round thing with seats in it.  It was like the weird era where they just built.  But they basically blew off the outfield as far as putting seats there.  So they had to make up for not having seats in that area. 
[00:24:30]  So they had to build up.  So a lot of these seats are ridiculously high.  It's just an awful place.  But it's coming down.  And a lot of people are very excited to see a new facility there.  By the way, Mr. Met was there last night, too.  Really?  Big-headed Mr. Met.  You're kidding, aren't you?  No, Mr. Met was there.  All the big stars.  The big baseball-headed Mr. Met.  Very exciting.  How much do you want to see him riding through Dealey Plaza?  Oh, look, there I am with the cowboy.  How big is that guy?  He's a pretty tall drink of, well, water. 
[00:25:00]  A little bit of fluid.  Some fluid.  You look very nice in your Armani suit, but you also look like someone we don't know.  Like, who is that person?  You look swarthy.  Right.  You look like you're a billionaire or something.  Thank you, Opie.  That's the look I was going for.  It's very odd.  We're not used to you dressing up like that.  I know.  You're like a shady businessman from the Middle East. 
[00:25:30]  Doesn't he?  Yes.  He's trying to make some oil deal.  Yes, my friend.  Yes, my friend.  Yeah.  All right, well.  So, the reason I bring up the Subway Series is because they're taking this Subway Series  very, very seriously.  Listen to the dramatic music.  They're playing this spot on this hacky news channel here in New York.  Hey, hey.  I don't know.  What is it called?  The WB?  CW 11?  Something like that?  Very, very hacky.  Very amateur news. 
[00:26:00]  Hacky?  Amateur?  Hey, hey.  They're extremely, extremely, not professional.  Professional newscasters there that know, they got their hand on the pulse of the city.  I think Stony Brook University's TV station does a better job with news than this CW 11  here in New York.  No, they're the best in New York.  It's an embarrassment to media in general.  It is not.  They all do a great job over there. 
[00:26:30]  So, this is how they're working the last Subway Series at Shea Stadium.  Remember, Shea Stadium, a crap hole, has been a crap hole ever since I can remember.  Yeah.  To some, it is simply a place where games are played.  Actually, to everyone it is.  It's just a place where games are played.  Just a place where you feel comfortable puking because, you know what, you're really not  going to do much damage.  You can puke. 
[00:27:00]  You can have sex way up in the bleachers.  No one gives a crap.  This place stinks.  To some, it is simply a place where games are played.  To fans, it's a place where timeless memories are made.  Yeah?  Find me one.  I have a timeless memory from Shea.  Yeah?  Daryl Strawberry doing some you-know-what?  No.  What?  This is back when the New York Jets used to play there.  Yeah, exactly.  They had to roll out bleachers to make up for that other side of the stadium that didn't 
[00:27:30]  have seats.  And I remember my father, I had to go to the bathroom.  And my father took me into the bathroom.  And I was supposed to go, but there was this big trough there and just a bunch of men against  the trough.  And he was telling me, just go.  And I said, no, I can't because there's too many people.  And of course, I started crying because that's what I did as a kid. 
[00:28:00]  I just cried.  So I'm standing in Shea Stadium's bathroom with my father and a bunch of strange men crying  because I didn't want to stand there and go to the bathroom with all those people.  Did they ask your father to take his daughter out of the bathroom?  What a sissy.  I got to see Emerson Boozer play.  Wow, that's exciting, too.  A lot of excitement coming from you. 
[00:28:30]  That's one of my Shea Stadium memories.  He cried as Ed Cranepool put his hands down your boy's tuxus.  So this is how the CW11 here in New York is selling this last Subway Series at Shea Stadium.  The crap hole that is Shea Stadium.  Fans, it's a place where timeless memories are made.  This season, Mets fans will say goodbye to Shea Stadium.  But the memory of the last Subway Series at Shea will last a lifetime. 
[00:29:00]  The CW11 is proud to provide Mets fans with a chance to win.  Wait, wait, wait.  This isn't a joke?  No!  Thank you, Jimmy.  That's why I'm playing it.  Thank you.  You finally got what I'm trying to do here.  I thought it was a goof that they were doing it to be sarcastic and sad.  No, I was waiting for one of you guys to jump on board with this.  He can't because he's dating the traffic vixen.  But me and you can trash this crappy news agency.  You can't trash this.  News organization.  You know, some people are a little emotional and they're just kind of...  I'm telling you, I've seen... 
[00:29:30]  How many times have I been to Shea over the years?  Dozens of times.  Easy.  Yeah.  You're not going to find them.  They're not going to call up and go, you know what?  They're in agreement with what's going on here right now.  Yeah.  It's a horrible place.  Horrible.  Shea Stadium.  You hear this, Jimmy?  It's like the second coming of Christ.  I love the fact that...  For the last Subway series at Shea.  Jimmy thought it was a joke.  I thought it was a goof.  You thought we put this together or something, right?  No, I knew it was the news did, but I thought that they were... 
[00:30:00]  No, you knew we didn't put this together because that would mean working on the radio show, right?  Hey, we need you.  What's going on?  I'm not too...  I thought that the news did it as a goof.  No.  They're dead serious.  Shea.  It will last a lifetime.  The CW11 is proud to provide Mets fans with a chance to witness history.  Mets, Yankees, the last Subway series for Shea.  Tomorrow at 8th and Sunday at 1 on the CW11.  By the way, Jill will be hosting an event at the SPN Zone tonight. 
[00:30:30]  What event?  Well, it's the CW11's coverage of the Shea Stadium.  I'm, you know, the Subway series.  And I, of course, will be down there also.  Of course you will.  She's going to be on, you know, she's working.  She's doing like a little TV thing from down there.  Yeah.  What celebs will be there?  Yes, sir.  Well, this is what they are promoting as the Linda Church and Jill Nicolini pregame show. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, is that it?  That's how they're promoting it on the CW11.  Yeah.  I guess it's traffic and weather leading up to the big doubleheader tonight.  Wow.  It's a doubleheader, too?  Yeah.  There's a game at one stadium and then moves to the other.  Oh, yeah.  So make up for the rain out.  Yeah, they're doing that again.  And then they'll have the helicopters following the team buses from one stadium to the other.  Who gives a crap?  Well, you never know what will happen.  I have a Shea Stadium memory.  Yeah, go ahead, Danny.  Oh, Danny.  Danny's going to give us a real Shea Stadium memory.  Well, my crying in the bathroom is one. 
[00:31:30]  And I do have to acknowledge, because I'm getting killed on instant feedback, yes, I do know  the Beatles played there in 1964.  Oh, my God, the Beatles.  All right.  But, Danny, you got a Shea Stadium memory?  Yeah.  When I was in high school, we got free tickets from one of my teachers, and we all decided  that it was going to be a real fun time to drop acid and go to the game.  Oh.  So my first acid trip ever was at Shea Stadium.  See?  Now that's a memory.  Didn't you hold Opie's hand at Shea?  Was that at Shea?  All right. 
[00:32:00]  That was more of a romantic encounter.  Yeah, see?  Now that's a memory.  We might have had box seats, like, way, way down near the field, and yes, I might have  held Danny's hand all the way out of the stadium.  Walking up, thinking it was your girlfriend.  Thinking it was my lovely, lovely fiance.  Yeah.  That's the great thing about her, because, like, she saw my hand coming, and they were  already holding hands, so it just had to be a quick swap. 
[00:32:30]  Really fast, because another reason why this place stinks, the box seats and all the seats  in general are just squished together.  There's no room to move, and even the aisles suck, so I reached behind.  I even look.  I did the visual, and I grabbed their hand, like, all right, let's get out of here, and  somewhere along the way, they decided to do the old switcheroo.  They switched hands.  The old switcheroo.  She rules, because she was on board with this bit, just with eye contact.  I didn't have to say anything or make a hand motion. 
[00:33:00]  I just kind of looked at her, and she knew exactly where I was going with this.  I was like, be my guest.  And I'm feeling all good, and I swear, I've told this story a couple times, but I'm getting  recognized as fans all over the place.  I'm just waving, like, yo, what's up?  Yay.  Pointing, and, like, cha-cha-cha.  And I was really hamming it up behind him, too.  Like, as I'm holding his hand, I have, like, my finger up to my mouth.  Oh!  You know?  And then we walked under the, what would you call it, you know, now you're inside the  stadium, whatever. 
[00:33:30]  And I turned, and it's Danny.  I was mortified.  Yeah, like, he kind of made that.  And then I had a laugh.  He kind of made the, oh, face.  And then I didn't realize how long he had been holding a hand.  So he had to say, yeah, he had to start thinking.  He was like, you've been seeing it the whole time?  The whole time I was holding your hand while all fans are waving to me?  Yeah, because then I'm thinking, all right, maybe it was just the last, I don't know,  few feet.  20 feet, no.  Yeah, no.  It was from the field all the way up.  I think Linz had your hand for maybe about 15 seconds.  And I know it's just some over the thumb rub. 
[00:34:00]  Can you rub?  You're holding it?  Well, yeah, I was making sure to hold him very softly as to not blow up my own spot.  Right, right.  That it was another man holding his hand.  That is a Shea Stadium memory, I think.  All right, I got a Shea Stadium memory.  I'm going to miss one.  I'm going to miss this crap hole.  You're right.  I'm on board with this CW 11.  You're not going to miss those big neon men that are surrounding Shea Stadium on the outside?  No.  Oh, those are cool.  And how about the Big Apple?  Oh, when they get a home run and the Big Apple came out of the hat. 
[00:34:30]  Out of the top hat.  Out of the hat.  They did it when a George Harrison song would play, too.  When the Big Apple hat was working.  A big rotten plum.  Half the time, it wasn't working.  Yeah, well.  The Apple hat stunk.  Oh, God.  I hate the Apple hat.  Hope they don't bring that back.  No.  We're winning for a...  Here's their commercial.  There's the dramatic commercial right there. 
[00:35:00]  Everyone having their memory.  Stupid Mr. Baseball head met guy.  Yeah.  I'll miss that place.  How's the new stadium look?  Have you seen...  It's quite nice.  It actually looks really cool.  They put it up super quick.  It's almost done.  Yeah, well, they're playing there next year.  And it actually looks really good.  I mean, obviously, you can't see inside or anything, but just from the looks of the outside of it,  I mean, it really looks like a real stadium.  It's another Camden Yards, basically.  Yeah, that's the design everyone's going for in every city with their new ballparks. 
[00:35:30]  Retro.  Camden Yards revolutionized stadiums, and everyone followed suit.  The one in Philly there is amazing.  Oh, for the Phillies, yes.  Oh, my God.  I don't know the name of it.  I'm not going to sit here and, you know, front.  Some bank stadium.  Probably, yeah.  That's all you got to do.  Put a bank name in front of it, stadium.  Yeah, and this new, you know, city field, it better be good, because I just...  You know what's going to happen if it's not a very good stadium, what they'll be calling it, you know, all the time.  City field can easily be called something that... 
[00:36:00]  City park.  Who wants to hear that?  Exactly.  Hey, the Yankee stadium's the same year, or is that the year after?  I think it's the same, right?  What, for the new stadium?  Yeah.  Yeah, they both start next season.  What's Yankee?  Are they modeling off the old Yankee stadium with the posts out in the outfield, or...?  Well, what happened with Yankee stadium, it hit yesterday that they were supposed to use part of the old stadium in the new design,  and then they decided not to, so now there's a bit of an uproar from Yankee fans. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, they're just plowing under the old stadium.  They just said, you know what, we can't, like, yeah,  construct around this crap, we're just going to plow it all over and do this right.  Yeah.  Because they were going to try to incorporate it somehow, but decide against it.  I believe that hit yesterday.  Yeah, they're moving, they were going to take the facade and put it in, but I guess they're going to recreate it,  and they're moving the monuments to an indoor museum, which I think is a mess,  because Monument Park was part of the cool thing about Yankee stadium.  Yeah, why are they doing that?  So they can make money selling tickets year-round, and people can come in and visit. 
[00:37:00]  Ah, there you go.  Yeah, well.  What about the almighty dollar?  Ah, regular Joe.  Hey, wasn't there a time when the monuments were actually in the field?  Yeah.  Yeah, not too long ago that that was all open back there.  Who decided that was a good idea?  To have, like, basically tombstones in the middle of the outfield.  As you're chasing down a fly ball, you're hitting into a tombstone of Babe Ruth or Lou Gehrig or something.  Congratulations to the Mets.  They can't help themselves. 
[00:37:30]  The New York Mets have announced that the home run Apple will be coming to Citi Field next season  when the team plays its first season in its new home.  And the big home run Apple is coming, the Chief's CEO, Jeff Wilpon, said during a media tour.  I'm glad the Mets have decided to bring the beer.  Why?  Thank God.  Because we're all into tradition.  Everyone loved it.  We love tradition.  We can't let go of it.  Everyone likes a home run Apple. 
[00:38:00]  It's stupid.  What's it mean?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Home run and get the fruit.  I don't know.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Yeah, New York hasn't really been known as the Big Apple in a while.  It's not.  Years ago, that was a biggie.  Yeah.  Not anymore.  Hey, we've got Louis C.K. joining the show after the break here.  And a look at the Opie and Anthony gossip.  Sam's got to make a new one.  Sam's got to make a new one.  This one's a bit old, but maybe there's a few people out there that haven't heard this one yet. 
[00:38:30]  So we'll play this as we go to break.  People are asking for the Carol Miller tapes, too.  I don't know if we're going to have time today.  We'll try.  By the way, Opie and Anthony both write Citizens Bank Park in Philly.  Citizens Bank.  Citizens Bank.  Thank you.  Yes.  Thanks for that, Jimmy.  Well, I got that text from a Philly friend.  It kind of sucks that they name them after banks and stuff, because some of the names  used to be kind of cool, you know?  How about Sperm Bank Field?  That'd be a great one.  We're back with more news. 
[00:39:00]  We just recently reported that E-Rock from the Opie and Anthony show would be looking for  a new job.  What?  E-Rock!  Will you get back to your post?  E-Rock abandons his post a lot.  All the time.  Stop socializing.  Mr. Rock had just found a position as a television spokesperson, but after a controversial commercial,  he's once again out of work.  Commercial for Heinz shows an apron-clad man in the kitchen making sandwiches for the kids  before sending off his significant other with a kiss and urging him to come straight home 
[00:39:30]  from work.  The sex bagel reportedly insisted on inserting his own personal habits into the condiment commercial.  However, after the spot aired in the UK, many were outraged, including radio personality  Opie.  Why would they have two gay guys kissing to sell mayonnaise?  Well.  In a shocking twist, Opie's partner, Anthony, disagreed and was reportedly beyond upset about what  happened to his former co-worker.  Why are people so hung up on what gay people are doing? 
[00:40:00]  Like, does it really affect anybody?  Why was Anthony so upset?  Haven't heard much about Jill lately.  Could a new budding romance be on the horizon?  If he comes straight home, that's bad.  He's gotta come gay home.  He's gotta still be gay.  We don't know.  But as far as we can tell, Antha Rock may be the next big thing in celebrity couple radio.  Stay tuned as we keep you updated on all the inside info from around the globe. 
[00:40:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony on your radio.  Let's remind the fine folks, Jimmy.  What, we got lawn tickets today, right?  Yes.  I hope we're going to solid play, but I forgot.  No singing.  August 2nd at PNC.  Today, I think at 9 a.m., two hours from now, tickets go on sale for $10 lawn tickets.  We're only doing 1,000 of them this year.  But the show's August 2nd at PNC. 
[00:41:00]  It's the only traveling virus we're doing thanks to not being able to get the venue we want in Boston.  And not being sure what's going to happen with Buffalo.  It's very scary.  Yeah, if the media is listening in Boston, enough.  We need to talk to Mayor Menino and work out our differences.  Oh, boy.  The thing happened well over 10 years ago, and we want to be doing live events for our Boston audience.  We're doing very well in Boston.  We had a trend come out yesterday.  We went through the roof. 
[00:41:30]  And we want to be doing things.  We got an animation festival we would love to do in Boston.  We would love to take this traveling virus comedy show to Boston.  But there seems to be a problem between us and the mayor still, 10 years later.  10 years later, and there's still issues.  People could, like, you know, be out of jail by now for murdering someone.  Yeah.  Let up a little, please.  Let it go.  It's time, sir.  It's time.  I don't like the way you said we want to talk to the mayor.  Like, someone's going to go, all right, get him on the horn. 
[00:42:00]  You should.  Get him on the horn.  I want to discuss the fake death thing with him.  Yeah.  Well, we acknowledge that.  He's hurting the economy, isn't he?  Because that's a lot of you.  If you sold out a stadium, that's money that the city would have had.  We would sell easily 10,000 tickets up there.  Yeah, so he's hurting the economy.  Yes, yes.  And we've acknowledged at this point how dumb it was for us to do that.  Back in the day.  And it's time.  Yeah, relax.  Let it go.  Let us do our stuff up there. 
[00:42:30]  And you haven't made fun of him since.  Hell not.  Well, just the basic fun.  You know, he's a marble-mouthed idiot.  That'll get us right in there.  Okay, look forward to us in Boston there.  The Ambassador and Anthony Show.  Ambassador.  I think he could, you know, respect the fact that we're acknowledging he can't talk too well.  He's got a big tongue that might be a little too big for his mouth.  All right, why don't I shut up? 
[00:43:00]  877-212-01A.  I do want to say good morning to everyone listening on BCN.  We've got Louis C.K. in studio today.  Yes.  What's up, Lou?  Good morning, gentlemen.  That's it?  Yep.  I'll see you guys later.  All right.  Thank you, Louis C.K., for stopping in.  What time is your unmask today?  I'm doing unmasked at 1 o'clock this afternoon.  At Comics, which is...  So it'll be homeless people and...  Huh?  It'll be homeless people and...  I don't know who's at 1 o'clock on a Friday.  I guess somebody comes.  Who stops in?  What audience is there? 
[00:43:30]  You will have a full house.  Trust me.  And Ron Bennington does that.  Yes.  From the Ron and Fez show.  And he has become the new Barbara Walters of the interview for comedians because he does  get you guys to really open up and sometimes even weep.  Who's cried on that show?  Who's cried on that show?  Has anybody cried?  Has anyone cried on that show?  You should.  Check it before you said that.  I just heard he...  No, I heard he really gets guys to open up and talk about things they normally wouldn't  talk about. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, he'll get some stuff out of you.  Did you cry, Jimmy, when you were on?  Hell no.  No?  No.  Jimmy doesn't cry.  Jimmy doesn't cry.  Hey, Lou, I think Louie would be a great...  Because Louie's a great storyteller.  Like, Louie has this knack for really just being interesting.  It's very truthful.  He can tell a story better than most people I know.  I think you'll be a really interesting one-hour interview.  I hope so.  As poorly as I just sold that.  Yeah.  I heard Louie doing a bit the other day on XM, and I think it was for the Unmasked. 
[00:44:30]  They were promoing it or something.  And I wasn't sure it was you, but I was listening to it and I thought it was very funny.  And then it was like, and Louie C.K. will be...  I was like, oh, I should have known that was Louie.  What was the story about?  It was very funny.  It was about your bank account being $10 negative.  Oh, that's really...  Yeah.  That's my old...  Yeah.  It was very funny, though.  Like, you're so broke, you can't even buy nothing because you don't have...  You have less than nothing.  Yeah, no.  It was about how I had like $15 in the bank, and then they charged me for not meeting the 
[00:45:00]  minimum balance.  So then...  It's a true story, too.  So now you're...  Then I had negative $10.  Negative 10.  Because they charge you for not having enough money.  They take money from you.  And which is, you know, it's how the country works.  Like, rich people actually get paid to have money.  Just because you have money, they just give you more...  More money, which is...  And if you don't have enough, they go, what are you doing?  That's not right.  Just give us more money.  And they charge you.  And they take $15 from you and give it to some rich guy. 
[00:45:30]  Right.  I mean, where else is it going?  It's not going anywhere else.  And then you have negative 10, and then it's...  God, this is an old bit.  And then at negative 10, you can't even afford something that doesn't cost anything.  Yeah.  Like, somebody goes, take this, it's free.  I'm like, I can't afford it.  I don't know.  That costs nothing, and I have less than that.  That is a great bit, though.  The people that...  It's 10 bucks to be broke.  The people that have negative accounts shouldn't be the ones that get the money.  Yeah.  The problem isn't being worked very well.  Every month, yeah, you have to keep this minimum balance, or they take the money that obviously 
[00:46:00]  you can't afford to lose because you can't keep up the minimum balance.  But if you do take a step back and just look at it, how ridiculous is it that the more money  you have in the bank, they give you more money.  Yeah.  No, if you have $100 million in the bank, they just give you $1 million periodically, every  so often.  As a reward for how lucky you are.  But if you've got $100...  Yeah.  And that's true about American life in every way.  Sure.  Like, if you have a load of money, then you get a loan, they don't charge you any interest 
[00:46:30]  at all.  Really?  And they give you incentives, yeah.  But if you're broke, if you're having trouble paying your bills, and you get a loan, your interest  is like 30%.  Yeah.  It's the only way you'll get a loan, and then you're paying more.  And so you actually...  They're putting you at higher risk to default.  Yeah.  Because you're such a default risk.  And if you do happen to get, like, a credit card with a lower interest rate, and you miss  a payment, the interest rate goes up.  Yeah, so now they're... 
[00:47:00]  So they're charged...  Obviously, you couldn't afford to pay it at the lower rate, but now that you missed the  bill, paying the bill, now they're going to charge you even more, 25% interest instead  of, like, 12.  It should be the other way around.  If you're knocking your bills down early, they're like, oh, I see you have a...  Oh, well, then let's go ahead and double that.  Yeah, double it.  It seems like it's not going to hurt you.  Yeah.  So I could afford it.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  And after...  By the way, if you're listening to XM202 today and you can't make Louie's taping,  they're airing My Unmask, Regan's, and Patrice's from noon to three, I think, instead of 
[00:47:30]  Ron and Faye.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  Yeah, that lazy crew just taking the day off as you...  Oh, again.  Yeah, Ron.  How dare you.  All right.  Hey, moving on.  Louie's got a couple daughters there.  He's an incredible father.  Oh.  And, you know, they're...  You don't like people to know that?  What?  No, I'm just an incredible father.  No, thank you.  You really are.  I'm just throwing back by...  What he's saying is you're not a credible father.  You're an incredible father.  I'll tell you why I know that you're an incredible father. 
[00:48:00]  Why?  Because in the middle of doing some great radio with us, you'll stop everything and make  a million people wait so you can answer your daughter's question in the background.  Sure.  And it's happened on many occasions.  Instead of saying, shut up, daddy's killing, I'll get to you in a minute, you stop the whole  process to make sure she's okay.  Yeah, because she doesn't carry them on the radio.  Right.  She needs to know if...  The other day, I was walking with my daughter, the six-year-old, and we had just come from  this school picnic she had, and we were there with her sister and her mom, who I'm now divorced 
[00:48:30]  from.  But we were all there together.  Aw.  And then we're walking away, and she stopped and looked kind of somber and said, daddy,  can I ask you a question?  And I thought, oh, wow, this is going to be heavy.  Heavy stuff.  Like, she's deep in thud.  She looked really serious.  Yeah.  And I actually got on a knee, and I said, of course you can ask me a question.  And she said, how many seconds an hour? 
[00:49:00]  And I said, oh, well, honey, your mother doesn't love you.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Now, you say you're divorced.  It's all over.  No, no, we're separated.  You're going through the thing.  Yeah, I just like saying divorced.  It feels good.  I mean, we just haven't done it.  Get used to it.  We haven't set a date yet.  Yeah.  Looking forward to it.  It is exactly the same as getting married on the other end.  On the tail end of it, yeah. 
[00:49:30]  Like, when you're getting married, when you truly love each other, you're like, well,  we'll have the wedding at some point.  Like, we don't really care.  We're, you know, like engaged couples that kind of don't get around to it for a while.  And say, oh, no, I mean, you know, we're never, we hate each other.  But at some point, we'll put it on paper.  We're going to have a small divorce.  Just go to City Hall.  Yeah.  You know, just the two of us.  I don't want a lot of people being involved.  Do you think this is going to be a messy divorce?  No, I don't think, because we're doing it together.  And I, anybody who's getting, the only reason I say this on the air, because I think it's 
[00:50:00]  important, if you get divorced with kids, you should do it with a mediator.  If you get two lawyers, the lawyers want you to fight to the maximum level.  Of course they do.  But that's smart.  Because there's nothing in it for the lawyers if it's solved right away.  No.  The longer it goes, you know, they get their piece of the action.  It's the worst possible way.  Because when you have kids, if you're divorced and you have kids, you're still combined,  you're still a family.  Yeah, you have now this permanent attachment to this woman. 
[00:50:30]  Forever.  No matter what.  Forever.  She will always be the third most important person in my life, even if I get remarried.  I am so glad I didn't have kids.  Yeah, no, you're not.  I am so glad.  I never have, I just, I just ship off checks.  And even that, that will end.  Yeah, and if we had two lawyers, they would both tell us the most contentious version of  our rights so that we would fight each other.  And then our, and also it's.  Wait, who has a mediator get paid? 
[00:51:00]  How do you guys pay a mediator?  As opposed to a lawyer getting a percentage.  How does a mediator make you pay?  We pay him per the hour.  We go every week to this guy.  And he, and we talk.  Together?  Yeah.  And how is that?  And it kind of divvies stuff up.  Well, and we talk about our schedule with the kids.  There's a lot of, you know, there's an ongoing process of raising the kids together.  But are you looking at each other like, I hate you?  Or is it like very.  Well, I don't, there's times in mediation, I don't hate her.  And actually we've got, we've grown to be pretty, you know, we get along better now,  for sure.  I don't, don't hate her.  Never have. 
[00:51:30]  But when I'm in mediation, I mostly talk to him.  Like I've actually gone through whole sessions where I don't.  She could have been wearing a Nixon mask.  And I wouldn't have known.  Yeah.  I would have never gone, whoa, hey, that's weird.  Why'd you do that?  Yeah.  Lawyers will just rip you to pieces.  Make you, really make you hate the other person.  Yeah.  And also it doesn't make sense financially because there's a bunch of things that like, like there's 
[00:52:00]  going to be some formula of how much am I paying in child support and how much am I paying in  alimony and how much of it is this enhanced earnings thing.  And those three are different tax rates and stuff.  So it's better for the family in general.  If I boost, like, I don't know which one is less taxes.  Yeah.  But if it was lawyers, they would just try to get these maximum amounts for her and  it wouldn't make sense.  You know what I mean?  That's good.  So we can actually, we're all, we all have to, we all have to live together.  So we're doing it with this guy and we make all the agreements for the divorce together, 
[00:52:30]  but then it's written as a contract and it's binding by law.  Is it really?  Yeah.  My divorce trial lasted.  Yeah.  A court, I can make, I can, you know, we can force each other to do it.  Once we've agreed to it, it's exactly like a divorce settlement.  It's the same thing, but we just did it jointly.  Is the, is the mediator a lawyer?  He's like a, he's a guy who's just part therapist, part lawyer, part a bunch of things.  He knows, he just knows everything.  Jack of all trades, master of none.  Right.  More people are doing it your way too. 
[00:53:00]  There's the only way to do it.  This is the way to go.  It's the only way to do it.  Because Anthony, yes.  My actual divorce trial lasted probably 20 minutes before I just sat, I was in the stand  and I'm being questioned and I just said, no, stop this.  I'm going to settle.  Right.  I'm just going to walk into a room with the ex, sit her down, no lawyer in there, no nothing  and go, okay, we got to settle this because I can't, I can't go through this.  That's awful.  It's horrid.  And you do wind up really legitimately hating the person. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, definitely.  No, it's, it's the worst thing in the world because nobody, you couldn't possibly feel  more anger towards anybody than an ex-spouse.  No.  There's nobody you could possibly, that is the worst person on the planet.  And being filtered through a lawyer.  Oh yeah.  Like that.  And no one, no one can take more from you than someone who you were supposed to share  everything with the rest of your life and who now, and who now you're not going to.  I was driving home so many times where I was just, I, it was, it was all consuming. 
[00:54:00]  I'd be driving home with anger.  Yeah.  Just anger and, and just wishing awful, horrible things.  Yeah.  It's just, it's terrible.  No, it is terrible.  And the guy, the guy told us, the mediators helped me a lot.  In one sense, he's given me perspective on the thing.  Cause like one time we were talking about some issue and I'm telling him really like,  I feel like I'm saying something really dramatic right now.  This is like something I'm opening up and saying that I haven't said in 15 years with 
[00:54:30]  her.  And, and he has, you know, I'm going to really make him understand this.  And as I'm saying this really big stuff, I realized that he's sort of staring at my eyes  and then my nose and then he's drifting.  And then all of a sudden he goes, like, like he's surprised all of a sudden to be in the  room.  Cause he was falling asleep.  And I'm looking at him, he's looking at me really intently.  And then all of a sudden he goes, uh, what?  And I realized that I, he's been falling asleep while I'm talking because I'm boring and we're 
[00:55:00]  boring.  The whole thing is boring and common and stupid.  He's heard it all.  He's seen it all.  Yeah.  And also who cares?  Like, I think it's this big thing I'm going through.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Just another couple break it up.  Shut up.  That's what the, that's the same thing I thought about the, uh, the trial.  Like I'm thinking, I'm talking to my lawyer and I'm going, I got this, this, I was thinking  about this all night and strategy.  And it's like, no, no, you don't seem to understand this is a formula thing. 
[00:55:30]  No, this is a math problem.  This has nothing to do with you.  No one's going to barge into the courtroom and so your honor, I have evidence that's  going to, it's, it's, it's, it's this and this and they take a little slide rule and  they do that and that's what happens.  No, it's just America taking another dump in the love statistics.  Yeah.  That's it.  You're a stat.  Congrats.  Congrats.  Statistic.  High statistic.  How are you?  High 70, 70%.  Yeah.  Is it up to 70 now?  I think it's, uh, it's about that. 
[00:56:00]  We're really got to hit that a hundred percent mark where nothing ever works out.  I remember when it was like 50 or 60.  Now they're saying 70.  I might be saying that.  Wow.  The divorce rate?  I might be making it up.  Don't get excited.  Wow.  He's still saying wow.  I'm really getting it.  It doesn't matter.  You said it.  Now it's, it's out there.  You just threw it through this microphone.  It went out the airwaves and now it's fact.  That's great.  Find that stat there, Stunpring.  Hey, so going back to your kids, uh, there's a, there's a story that happened in a, in a mall.  Uh, I want to get your take on it.  Simple.  All right.  All right.  It's a pretty good one. 
[00:56:30]  A mother outraged.  Her five-year-old daughter had an emergency and she says store employees refused to  help.  The mother says she was eating at a shopping mall when her five-year-old started screaming.  Many parents can relate.  It was a bathroom emergency.  But when she went to the nearest place for help, they said no.  She says her daughter had a massive accident.  Well, now the store owner is receiving death threats because of this bathroom backlash.  This just never should have happened. 
[00:57:00]  It never should have escalated this high.  Oh, but it did.  Now, one mother has started an internet campaign and this store owner.  People have, have called asking if this is my address and said my address to my daughter  and she was terrified.  Says she's now getting death threats.  Good.  The only one that I actually read was the one that said what they wanted to do to me.  That was, beat me with a lead pipe.  Well, stop thinking your stupid bathroom is sacred. 
[00:57:30]  All right.  Wait a minute, though.  So this mother is starting the internet campaign against the store?  Yeah.  What kind of stuff?  I hate the mother.  I hate her.  Do you really?  Yes, I do.  Yeah, but see, you got the five-year-old.  Obviously, the five-year-old.  I got a six-year-old and a three-year-old and I've been out in public with them many times.  Yeah.  I've been at a Yankee Stadium with them.  And you need a, you need a bathroom.  Yeah, you need a bathroom.  Okay, here's what happens.  You're at Yankee Stadium with your two kids and you don't want to, you know, the Yankee  Stadium men's room is pretty disgusting. 
[00:58:00]  Sure is.  And I don't want to go there and be in line with my kids and then go into a stall that's  just got, it's just a chocolate-covered toilet seat.  But I do it because I know later I might not have a bathroom.  She didn't, if her kid has started screaming, I have to go to the bathroom, that means she's  a lousy mother.  That's all, I can just tell you that as a fact.  Oh, that.  That she doesn't know how to take care of her kids.  She should have maybe sooner found something.  She's a self-centered, stupid mother eating a fat burger at the mall. 
[00:58:30]  Just an idiot.  The key word there was massive.  Yeah.  The kid had a massive accident.  I don't want to, I think there's more that's going to be revealed here.  Oh, is there?  Instead of us saying it, because like the lead pipe thing, you know, came out of nowhere.  I'm hoping these other facts come out of nowhere.  You should have let pipe.  Yeah, Anthony said massive.  Massive is key to this story now.  Okay.  Keep listening.  Okay.  You know, and this lady's now getting death threats because, you know, she wouldn't let 
[00:59:00]  the mother with the young child use her bathroom.  Yeah, because there's rules about it.  Your public restrooms, yeah.  When you have a store or a restaurant, your bathrooms are either rated for public use  or not.  Yeah.  You can't, it's actually a rule.  So the woman's legitimate by not letting the person.  It's a dumb bathroom.  All right.  Let's hear.  This after a Huntington Beach mom walked into Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory.  Louis C.K. just did a spit take.  Ah, come on. 
[00:59:30]  No way.  Wow.  Is that the name of the movie?  That's why we didn't want to give too much away.  Yeah, there's a lot of surprises in this story.  A lot of surprises.  My daughter left truffles all over the floor.  Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory.  Yuck.  Uh, just let her drop one on the wax paper next to the other ones.  Right.  Let Lucy wrap it up after.  Cool, no.  This after a Huntington Beach mom walked into Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory last Thursday. 
[01:00:00]  She was carrying the child when she came running over here to say, my four-year-old, my four-year-old,  she has diarrhea, she needs to go to the bathroom.  My four-year-old.  What is it with you saying, my four-year-old twice?  Probably so they would know it wasn't for her.  Right, right.  Yeah.  I get it.  No, she had diarrhea.  It's not her kid.  Oh, how great is this?  Sorry, go ahead.  Chocolate Factory.  Diarrhea.  Diarrhea.  It's the best day of my life.  This is fantastic.  Cha-cha-cha.  My four-year-old, my four-year-old, she has diarrhea, she needs to go to the bathroom. 
[01:00:30]  Owner Bonnie Overturf wasn't there at the time.  She says her employee instructed the mother to go to the public restrooms around the corner.  A policy Overturf has advised all employees to follow.  Per health department regulation, no person not working with the food can come through the food and be that close to the food.  But on a blog, the mother wrote, I begged them to have a heart, that she was only five.  But by that time, she had lost it all over herself and me. 
[01:01:00]  I begged them to have a heart.  Have a brain, idiot.  The bathroom's around the corner.  It's around the corner.  Just go.  You're in a mall.  There's bathrooms around the corner.  You don't go into a store.  If you're in a mall, you don't go into the chocolate store to use a bathroom.  The Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory.  You moron.  You know what?  You've got to let the mother use the dumb bathroom.  I hate these.  They're scum.  Just the way they would make it.  Knowing it's a little kid and they couldn't give the kid a break. 
[01:01:30]  It's like, so what, the mother's stupid.  You're going to make the kid pay?  That store sucks.  I don't know, man.  I hate kids.  Well, probably it's like a bathroom that's behind the counter.  Yeah, it sounded like it was in a place where it's too close to the Rocky Mountain Chocolate.  And you don't want a little kid back there.  Now they were just being stupid employees like every one of us deals with.  Just complete robot employee douches.  I guess it just touches a nerve with me because I hate the mother.  I hate most American parents, which is so stupid. 
[01:02:00]  They don't make the slightest effort.  I'm so happy.  You've got a head of things like a kid.  So happy she's exploded on.  When you're out with your kid, you ask him every 20 minutes or so.  You got to go?  Do you have to go?  Yeah, but I'm with Jimmy, man.  You walk around New York, you need a bathroom every once in a while.  There's a bunch of these scums.  They won't let you use their bathroom.  You have to buy something.  So then you're sitting there buying dumb gum so you can use their stupid turlet.  But knowing it's for a kid, that's what it's worth.  Even worse, sure.  Look, I've pulled over with my kid at a gas station or something or a restaurant, 
[01:02:30]  and they'll go, you can't use the bathroom.  And I do get mad.  But you're responsible for your kid's anus and urethra and what emits from there on.  So they didn't let you use it?  Yeah, that's happening to me before.  Why do they lock the bathrooms at gas stations?  Does anyone know the answer to that question?  Me and Frank DeVigo had a funny joke.  Are they afraid someone's going to break in and clean it? 
[01:03:00]  Here's the last part of the story.  This is what the mother wants everyone to do because of what happened.  Had I been there, yes, I probably would have allowed her to go in the back.  Because I am a mother, and I understand that.  The mother says she ran into the theater next door to clean her daughter up.  So far, over 100,000 people have viewed her blog,  where she encourages others to boycott all Rocky Mountain chocolate fashions.  See, I hate her.  I don't hate her.  I love her. 
[01:03:30]  I'll tell you why.  I hate her.  She's sitting there.  This is what I see.  See, I'm a parent.  So this is what I see now.  She's sitting there starting a blog and a website.  Yes.  And her kids, mommy, shut up.  Shut up.  I'm doing my blog.  I'm making a website because you pooped your pants on my body.  Mommy, I'm tired.  I want to go to bed.  Shut up.  I'm blogging about your diarrhea that came out of your anus.  No.  Sorry.  It was funny, but it's all right. 
[01:04:00]  Here's what it is.  It's so true.  No, he's right.  This woman is now, she has this purpose.  Yeah, no, it's just, it's doing everything to avoid being any kind of a parent.  She's so sick and tired of dealing with this.  It's not like an isolate.  It's everywhere you go.  It's every robot.  I could care less about anything other than getting out of here, employee, and they treat  you like crap and people get tired of it.  So when you have a chance, she's just attacking.  Why don't, why don't 100,000 people go?  Because everyone.  Because people enjoy being angry, especially from a what about the kids angle. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  But I don't care about kids.  How awful.  You know, it's okay for single people to do stuff like this, but when you have kids,  you just roll with the punches.  I mean, she's being stupid.  And also, I don't know.  I mean, I wasn't there, but the timing of the story sounds like she ran in.  I mean, this is what it sounds like.  She went, oh, help.  I'm going to sue you now.  Yeah.  It was like, help.  Oh, man, we don't allow this.  Please, could you just, oh, I'm going to go do a blog. 
[01:05:00]  It sounds like even if she let her use the bathroom, that the kid was going to lose it  before they made it.  Yeah.  She probably would have had diarrhea on top of the chocolate.  Yeah.  I think there's a good shot.  Good chance.  If the diarrhea got on the mother, which is, so the kid was probably wearing a dress.  Oh, God.  Oh.  The mother got diarrhea on her, according to this story.  Yeah.  So, a little girl had, like, this skirt, which looked like an upside-down funnel.  She was like a diarrhea dispenser. 
[01:05:30]  She came in holding a kid in her arm saying, can I please splurge diarrhea all over your  food?  Can I hand her to you over the counter so that the diarrhea just...  Just goes all over your Rocky Mountain chocolate.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get to the end of the story.  I'm rooting for the blog.  Yeah.  Let's...  I hate these employees.  Let's see how this ends.  We'll give you nothing.  A few seconds of dead air to let the delay build up.  All right.  Let's see what else we got here.  ...others to boycott all Rocky Mountain chocolate factories. 
[01:06:00]  On the mother's end, you know, what a sad thing.  You know, here you have a child, and we have an emergency, and where can I go?  If I was a mother, and I had to go and take my child somewhere, and am I going to have  a door closed on me because I'm having a problem?  Overture tells me she apologized to the mother.  She's also contacted police because of the anonymous threats.  We tried to contact the mother today, but couldn't reach her. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, because she was too busy blogging.  Yep.  That's good.  Good.  Talk, let me.  And oldie, but goodie.  Talk, let me.  Yeah.  That's what you get.  All right, we got to take a break.  We're getting a little late here.  That's what you get for being dicks all the time.  At every chance, people are dicks, and that's what you get.  Have a lead pipe hat, stupid.  We're in good health.  As we go to break, we got two things happening.  Lead shampoo. 
[01:07:00]  Two things happening, so listen very closely.  We got Louis C.K. in studio.  He's going to be at the State Theater tonight in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Tickets available by calling 732-246-SHOW, or you can go to myspace.com, obviously, slash  Louis C.K.  And then we got tickets for our O&A Travel and Virus Comedy Show going on sale today.  $10 long tickets for the August 2nd show at the PNC Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey.  And Louis, you can't see it on our show.  Unfortunately, you can't hold out and wait to see Louis, because he's going to be in  Edinburgh, performing in Scotland. 
[01:07:30]  We lost Louis this year to Edinburgh.  Scotland.  Scotland got him.  Very sorry to be missing.  It's actually pronounced Edinburgh.  Edinburgh, sorry.  Edinburgh.  So, Louis, if you want to see him at State Theater tonight.  But we got our $10.  It's a new hour of material, too.  So if you've seen me in the last six months, you're not seeing the same material.  No, it's going to be a very good day.  Why don't you stop?  Back up to whatever.  $10 long tickets starting at 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster for the August 2nd show at the  PNC Arts Center, the O&A Travel and Virus Comedy Show. 
[01:08:00]  We got Louis C.K. in studio today.  Opie and Anthony.  I'm dead serious about Mayor Menino.  He's got to let it go, man.  He's got to let it go.  I don't think he's going to with some of the comments that we've made.  We've got to get the word out.  We want to meet with the mayor.  You've got to get through one of these without making fun of him.  I know.  How about we let him...  We're a big part of Boston Radio. 
[01:08:30]  We have an animation festival that needs to be done in October.  We want to bring it to Boston, but we can't get a venue because, you know, he's holding  a grudge, this mayor.  Can we let him throw pies at us, maybe?  No!  Liggy, liggy.  And we want to bring the comedy show up there this summer, and we just can't do it.  We can't get into Boston itself.  He's got to let it go.  It's been 10 years, love.  10 years we did a dumb radio prank.  Did you ever tell him you're sorry?  Which we acknowledge now.  What?  Did you ever tell him you're sorry?  Did you ever do that?  There was attempts to get to the fine mayor, but you learn it's not easy to just call up 
[01:09:00]  a mayor.  I think we did apologize on the news, and it came off as one of the most insincere apologies  I've ever seen in my life.  Like a John Rocker apology?  It was so bad.  We were laughing during it.  Yeah.  We didn't know.  The new apologies now are like, I am very sorry that you're stupid and you thought  I did something wrong.  Yeah.  I'm really sorry of that.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm sorry I said those things. 
[01:09:30]  Because they're all forced.  Because they're all being pressured, and no one's being genuine about it because they  shouldn't have to apologize for everything they say that's not perfect.  Our country sucks.  Yep.  But it's time.  He's got to let it go.  We're going to be around for a few more years, and we want to do cool things in Boston,  and you've got to just stop.  Stop already.  He's not going to let it go, and he's not going to like the show anyway because it probably  He doesn't have to like the show.  I'm just saying.  You know.  They're the only city that's freaked out over the...  Oh, the homeless shopping spree. 
[01:10:00]  Of course, the homeless shopping spree.  And of course, that...  What was that thing that they get carried away?  The adult swim promotion?  Yeah.  Everyone else got it, but they think it's terrorism, and they shut the streets down.  He's a boob.  Yeah, no.  Once you realize, oh, it was just for a TV silly thing.  Yeah.  You stop being mad.  You don't keep...  Yeah, you don't keep...  You don't keep being mad when you find out...  This is what my...  Oh, ex-wife.  How nice does that sound?  That's what it was like with her that she'd get mad at me because she'd assume I did something, 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  She'd go like, you didn't call the pediatrician, did you?  Like, she wouldn't ever ask me, hey, did you call the pediatrician?  She'd go, you didn't call, did you?  Oh, you didn't call, did you?  And then I'd go, yeah, I called him.  I went and he gave me a script.  I went and got him, and the kid's on the stuff already, and we're set to go.  And she'd go, okay, because I thought, you know what?  I thought you're not going to do it, and I have to do everything.  And she'd yell at me anyway.  She's like, wait, wait, no, I didn't.  No, but I did do it.  Yeah, but you never do, though. 
[01:11:00]  But I did, though.  But I did, though.  So you can't.  But you're still the kind of, you're still, you know, so that's what this guy does.  That's what Mayor Menino does.  I would make a conscious effort to do certain things that I was told I didn't do.  Like, yeah, I didn't do enough of, or I didn't do.  So you make this conscious effort to do it.  Right.  And then if you slip up once, everything you did when you were doing it is negated, and  all of a sudden it goes right back to, you never do this. 
[01:11:30]  No, that's exactly right.  That's when you realize you're not storing equity with anybody.  No, you're not.  And you're not.  That means you can't repair a situation.  That means if somebody's mad at you because they're miserable, that's when you realize  it's got nothing to do with you.  Then it's time to leave.  It does, yeah.  It's just got to go.  When you get to that point where you're like, I'm actually changing and repairing some of  my faults, but they still exist in this person's brain.  Yeah.  Because they didn't exist in the reality to begin with. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, I'm really like.  Because I'm actually a much better person than they are.  You're trying to do something.  It's like, okay, all right.  You're not attentive enough for some certain thing.  So you become very attentive of this thing.  Make up for it and stuff.  And then the one day you screw up, you fall off the wagon of being attentive.  Yeah.  You are never attentive.  No, that's exactly right.  No, no.  But I was.  Do a Vulcan mind meld on me.  You'll read that I was actually consciously trying. 
[01:12:30]  Yep.  No, no.  No, no, you never have.  You never do.  That's too much pressure.  Time to leave.  It is too much pressure.  No, one big component of contention we had was anytime I would go to work, I was leaving  her with the kids.  Like anytime I would go to work, by the way, to pay bills.  You know.  To get stuff.  You know, stuff that, you know, food so people wouldn't die.  Die.  Can you give me a break?  I'm actually going to work. 
[01:13:00]  I'm actually going to work so that you don't have water.  If you don't have kidney failure and die, you didn't get all bloated and purple.  And that was a problem going to work?  But anyway, so sometimes I would go, I would actually say like, you know what, I'm not going  to take any extra gigs or run out.  I'm going to just like stay home for like a week.  Go do the shopping and bring both kids with me to do the shopping.  Like do everything I can for this X amount of days to totally take the pressure off of  her.  And then like after a huge amount of time of doing that, I'd go, okay, I'm going to 
[01:13:30]  run out and do a, do a show.  And she, what am I supposed to do?  She goes, what am I supposed to do?  You're leaving me here?  I'm like, wow.  No equity.  Have you known none at all?  It's like you have a bank account where you put in money all the time.  You go back and they go, no, no, you're not nothing.  There's nothing in there.  You have negative $10.  I was here two days ago.  I made $100,000 deposit.  No, you didn't jerk.  No, nothing.  You never do that.  Like if the bank could be moody, that would be them.  Take your money. 
[01:14:00]  No, you never put money in this account.  No, I really.  No, but I did.  I put a lot in recently.  Well, you know, the past week I didn't put any in, but I've been putting it.  No, you never did.  You never did.  But there's, I have footage of me putting.  Oh, you with your footage.  Well, you're out of that.  You're out of it.  I love it.  Can I ask you a question?  Maybe you can't think of the most because what's one of the most, the angriest you ever  were at your spouse? 
[01:14:30]  Boy, that's really hard to say.  We're one of them.  I know that there's probably not one like them.  No, it's like the Woody Allen's joke about my parents only hit me once.  They began beating me in 1947 and then finished in 1962 or something like that.  You can't really pick out that special moment.  Whatever.  Don Gavin in Boston who said, I tried Coke once for 15 years or whatever.  It's like that.  It's like just, I mean, I wasn't, it wasn't me being angry at her.  It was just a miserable 15 year misunderstanding. 
[01:15:00]  But I mean, what one would you ever like?  15 years of just slip up miscommunication.  There doesn't ever seem to be this defining one.  Wow, that was a real bad one.  It's just this underlying, miserable, you're stuck.  Yeah.  Here's what it was.  It's just every day.  It was like, okay, Anthony, today you were just something really exciting happened for  you.  Like you just got your own TV show.  Hey, yeah.  Pretty good news.  All right.  Let's just say. 
[01:15:30]  So you come home to bring this news home.  Oh, God.  Okay.  Yeah.  So just start like, you know, cause you're excited.  Yeah.  You just start saying, I just got called by HBO and this is what's going to happen.  And okay.  And I'm, I'm, I'm your wife reacting to this.  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.  Honey, you're not going to believe this.  HBO called.  I got the show.  This is going to be fantastic.  I'm going to be, I have a, have a show that this is going to, you're actually hurting  my ears.  Cause you talk quieter. 
[01:16:00]  No, you're just talking really loud.  Oh, you want a little softer.  Yeah.  Could you talk softer?  Well, HBO called and, uh, they picked up the show.  I don't know what that's going to, what does that mean?  You always assume I know everything about what does that mean?  Are you kidding?  Are you kidding?  Oh, God.  And then eventually you go, forget it.  Forget it.  What do you mean forget?  No, don't start saying, I don't appreciate what you do.  Don't go there. 
[01:16:30]  Look, I just, I'm going to go outside.  And then you go outside and you, you go around the corner of the house.  You smoke a cigarette and you stand there going, I don't know what is, and you tell  the dog.  I used to tell my dog good news.  And the dog was excited for you.  The dog was just tails wagging, wapping her tail on the floor.  You just knew the dog was excited for you.  He's listening as you lob like, whack on the peanut butter.  Yeah, exactly.  Slather it on. 
[01:17:00]  All right, now go to work.  I suck.  Oh, that is horrible.  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  Max, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Man, I love Louis C.K.  He is my favorite comic.  Dude, you are a funny bastard.  Thank you.  But I had a question for you.  Did your soon-to-be ex ever play that?  I call it the psychic game with you.  You come in and she doesn't say nothing to you.  And you look at her and you go, what's wrong?  And she goes, you know what you did? 
[01:17:30]  Psychic game.  No, I don't know what I did.  Why don't you tell me what I did?  Yeah, and then I always used to say, well, you know what?  Whatever it is I did, I hope I do it again ten more times just to piss you off.  It sounds like you might be part of the problem, sir.  Yeah.  Yeah, perhaps.  What can I say?  I don't know.  This is all softball stuff to me.  This is all the usual.  This is all surmountable.  Yeah.  That's dealable-withable. 
[01:18:00]  Well, let's go to Brooklyn.  Tony's got something.  Tony, what do you got?  Louis C.K., you get the props of the day because you are right on the money.  There is no equity bank for your feelings.  And whatever you think you're going to do right, you're never going to be right.  You are the man, buddy.  Thank you, pal.  All right.  All right.  Punch it out.  Hey, we've got to go backwards.  Remember we were talking about our apology?  We found the apology.  Really?  I'm serious about this whole Mayor Menino thing.  What year was this apology?  Ten years ago. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, this is funny.  Can we hear it?  Ten years.  It's been...  Yeah, if you're just tuning in, we've got a big audience in Boston.  The trend came out yesterday.  We did very, very well.  We're going to be around for a while.  And we really, really want to start doing gigs up in Boston again.  But last year, we couldn't do the comedy tour in the city of Boston.  We had to be on the outskirts, right?  We have an animation festival we want to do in Boston in October.  But once again, they're having a tough time finding venues because Mayor Menino is still 
[01:19:00]  holding a grudge for what we did ten years ago.  And I'm telling you, we've admitted that it was dumb and stupid and all that crap.  And we did apologize ten years ago.  Yeah.  And we just want him to finally let go of this thing.  We don't need you to like the show or anything like that.  But just let us do our stuff for the Boston audience.  This apology was given.  We had left the studio.  We had walked out into the elevator area and were blindsided by a news camera that wanted us to tell how we felt about the whole thing 
[01:19:30]  or if we had an apology or wanted to say anything to the mayor and his family.  And it was so insincere, this apology.  I don't see it that way.  Really?  I see that we were taken off guard a little bit and did the best we could.  All righty.  We didn't know there was going to be a reporter and a camera in our face at that moment. 
[01:20:00]  I'd love to hear it.  All right.  You got it there, Iraq.  Louie, listen closely, please.  You think saying the mayor was dead was crossing the line, though?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  See, right there.  Why are you laughing, Louie?  Right there is like you thought about it.  You went, uh, yeah.  Uh, yeah.  But that's taking responsibility.  I admit it.  Is it?  Uh, yeah.  Uh, yeah. 
[01:20:30]  It's an open-ended yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Look at us.  When you say something sincerely, you close it off at the end.  Yes.  Jimmy, you see it my way, right?  Uh, yeah.  Uh, I think you thought about it a little bit.  I knew what you were going for, like the, got to admit it, yeah, you got me.  Uh, pfft.  All right, stop laughing so we can get through this, Louie.  All right, okay.  You think saying the mayor was dead was crossing the line, though?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, I just wish, I just, I feel bad that the mayor's, you know, wife heard it.  Who knew that the mayor's family is fans of the Opie and Anthony show? 
[01:21:00]  All right, what's wrong?  All right, there is, why are you laughing at that?  Because that is nothing but pure sarcasm.  No, no, no.  That is sarcasm.  No, no, it's, instead of apologizing, you're promoting the show.  Promoting.  By reminding everyone, and also all people that are new to you, because it's the news,  that this show's for everybody.  Even the mayor's wife watches Opie and Anthony.  Even the mayor's wife on WBCN.  Well, no, we were at the other joint back then.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:21:30]  The only station that really rocks.  Oh, my God.  That is, what station was it?  It's the only station that really rocks, you know, because everyone else that played rock,  they really didn't have their heart behind it.  We are laughing.  We are just laughing.  We're not laughing.  What a couple of creeps you look like.  Oh, I didn't even see the picture.  Just ghouls.  Oh, my God.  We are ghouls.  Oh, my God.  You look like you're going to go to the Clutter House.  We've been in this business too long.  Yeah, that was on Channel 2008 Foundry. 
[01:22:00]  All right.  Yeah, well, of course, Steve has to take responsibility for what we did with our careers before we met  Steve.  Foundry logos all over our old stuff.  What an ass Anthony looks like with that hat and that hairdo.  I'm just the worst.  By the way, Stump Brain is reaching out to Mayor Bloomberg here in New York, and he's going  to talk to Mayor Menino, hopefully on our behalf.  We're taking this very seriously.  Oh.  It's time to bury this thing with the mayor of Boston. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Stump Brain can get some things done.  I'm telling you.  Let's go back to the apology logo.  That's right.  Anthony and the boy with the Dutch boy hairdo.  He's got a paint can saying you're sorry.  A paint can.  Here we go.  I feel bad that the mayor's wife heard it.  Who knew that the mayor's family is fans of the Opie and Anthony show?  Used to be.  Honestly, I think it's stupid.  I think anyone who listens to our show for the last three years knows what we're all about. 
[01:23:00]  We've done...  Actually, I think it's stupid.  Honestly, I think it's stupid, you say.  Grief stricken.  This is the worst apology I've ever heard.  It's a good apology.  It's a non-apology.  Very contrite.  Honestly, I think it's stupid.  I think it's stupid.  I think the mayor's stupid.  The family's stupid.  Everyone's stupid.  How many seconds?  I think it's less than 10 seconds from, yeah, to, I think it's stupid. 
[01:23:30]  That's how long you were able to hold the farce that you gave a crap for.  I'm looking at the timeline of that sound thing.  I think it's about 10 seconds.  Come on.  It's a terrible apology.  Let's acknowledge this was 10 years ago, though.  I know the mayor's people are listening.  We really want a meeting and bury the hatchet.  Finally.  Let's go back to the apology from 10 years ago.  Honestly, I think it's stupid.  I think anyone who listens to our show for the last three years knows what we're all about.  We've done pranks like this for the last three years. 
[01:24:00]  We apologize to the mayor and his family.  I am sorry, mayor.  What are you laughing at?  I go, we apologize to the mayor and his family.  It's like a four-year-old.  Yeah, it's like, all right, we apologize.  I'm sorry I hit my stupid, ugly sister in her fat face.  That is the most insincere apology I've ever given in my life.  And I've given some real insincere apologies.  It's just like, we apologize to the mayor.  All right?  You satisfied?  Look, this is the first apology of many that we had to do in our careers. 
[01:24:30]  This is the first one.  It's great.  Don't expect us to know what the hell we're doing.  I think we did a pretty good job for our first apology.  But it's not the first one you've given in your life.  Here we go.  It sounds like it.  Terrible.  It's unbelievable.  All right, let's go back to the apology.  We're almost done.  And then we got the mayor's response, I think, right after this?  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  We've done pranks like this for the last three years.  We apologize to the mayor and his family.  I am sorry, mayor and family.  Seriously. 
[01:25:00]  I will not accept their apology this time.  I will not accept their apology this time.  But you have to accept an apology.  That one?  It's part of the rules.  If someone apologizes, you go, oh, you apologized.  All right.  If they apologize, that was not an apology.  No, it wasn't.  You have to accept an apology.  It didn't resemble an apology.  That was worse than no comment would have been better.  Is there anything else left in that?  Yes.  All right, here we go.  We apologize to the mayor and his family.  I am sorry, mayor and family. 
[01:25:30]  Seriously.  I will not accept their apology this time because they went too far.  I have a great sense of humor in death.  But this is more than, this is not a laughing matter at all.  All right, listen, though.  But it's been 10 years.  So let's talk this out a little bit.  Let bygones be bygones.  It's time.  We love the city of Boston.  And we want to bring some things there.  Also, it was funny to say he's dead.  That's Louis C.K.  I, at this time, don't think it was funny.  Absolutely not. 
[01:26:00]  Despite the fact that I'm smiling from ear to ear at Lou's remark.  They're all fair game politicians.  Of course they are.  But 10 years later, we still can't get things done because of what we did in 98?  Come on.  Even, you know, Hillary Clinton campaigns with her husband after he had a woman do things  to his thing.  With altoids in her mouth.  Yeah.  With altoids in her mouth.  And she's like, oh, but he's immuno.  It's not that bad. 
[01:26:30]  I need him.  All right, it's break time.  Louis C.K., State Theater tonight, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 732-246 show for tickets.  And let's not forget, the O&A Travel and Virus Comedy Show.  We're only doing one.  Sorry, Boston, because we can't get the venue we want up there.  August 2nd, Homedale, New Jersey at the PNC Theater there.  A very good lineup.  More comedians to be named.  But the headline is 9 a.m. this morning through Ticketmaster.  We got $10 lawn seats.  Make sure you get those.  Oh, wait, we're going to go to the FU line before we go to break. 
[01:27:00]  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have seven new voice messages.  First voice message.

Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  That scared me.  That has shut someone up.  Good morning, it's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:29:00]  Louis C.K. in studio.  We got lots going on still.  We could go many different ways here.  We got the gun thing down there in D.C.  We got a car that's running on veggie oil.  Vegetable oil.  We got a GTA crime spree that happened.  What, out there on Long Island?  Yeah.  And then we got maybe a little movie talk.  I gotta get the trailer, man.  You do have to hear that, Jimmy?  You have to.  It's awful.  Well, Wall E is opening this weekend.  It's getting like 90% positive reviews on RottenTomatoes.com, another Pixar animation movie from Disney. 
[01:29:30]  And then Wanted, Angelina Jolie's movie with Morgan Freeman.  Right with him.  I wonder if he's going to play a different character in this movie, or is he going to play the same character he plays in every effing movie he ever does?  The guy who says wise things with that voice.  Oh, it stinks.  Very low-spoken.  Go back to Electric Company, you speckled-faced weirdo.  It wasn't even that great as The Pimp. 
[01:30:00]  I bought that movie on Otto's recommendation, that dumb Christopher Reeve movie.  What was it?  Streetwise.  Okay.  It wasn't even that great as The Pimp.  No.  He's awful.  I got Andy Dufresne.  Oh, drop dead.  Andy Dufresne.  I gotta correct myself.  I'd like to say the sisters never got to Andy.  Wally's getting 98% positive reviews.  I hate that movie.  Who's the douche that decided the movie sucks?  I hate Wally.  I hate that little... 
[01:30:30]  I've seen those little Pixar animations where it's a cute lamp.  Yeah.  Oh, it's cute.  It's looking up like a funny lamp.  And there's squeaky noises.  Shut up.  Some nerd animator just sitting there working diligently.  I know what you're talking about.  That's where it all began with the Pixar.  It was just a quick little two, three minutes short, right?  Those little things before movies that would...  And then afterwards, everybody would go, uh, shut up.  It's not cute.  Don't like it. 
[01:31:00]  Morgan Freeman was good in Glory.  I love him in Glory.  Yeah, he was very good in that movie.  It was hard to be bad in that movie.  It was just a darn good movie.  Oh, easy with the language, Lou.  Uh, going back to Mayor Menino, before we get this trailer on, uh, the people of Boston,  they're suggesting that we ask for forgiveness.  That's the way to go.  We gotta be more political with this.  Oh.  So Anthony and I are asking forgiveness today.  It's a Catholic city.  It's been 10 years. 
[01:31:30]  We're asking for more forgiveness from the mayor, because we really want to bring some  of our stuff, uh, to Boston in the very near future.  An animation festival.  And maybe it's not too late to bring this, uh...  You need to do it somehow with the Catholics.  That's how...  It's a Catholic city.  Yeah.  And so you need to latch on to a holiday, like Lent or something, and you need to get  a Catholic, uh, uh, clergyman to say, oh, the boys have apologized to the Lord, surely 
[01:32:00]  the city hall can...  Yeah.  Yeah.  You need, you need to get sponsored by a Catholic, uh, priest, uh, type person.  They're good at that forgiveness thing.  Yeah, because you give them money and they pretend, pretend you're good when you're not.  Let's get a priest on the phone from Boston.  Give us a call.  I'm sure a lot of them are listening.  They listen.  Yeah.  They don't.  Why would they?  Because they listen and they go, oh, these boys are not good boys.  They listen and they...  No, we're good boys.  Of course you are.  We really are.  Yeah, and there's nothing that's happened in recent since the mayor that would cause 
[01:32:30]  people in the church to be irritated.  Why don't you guys forget it?  They forgave us for this...  Forget it.  Hold on, Jimmy.  They forgave us for the, uh, the sex in the church thing down here in New York.  We're a lot of do gigs all over New York City.  That's the thing.  Thank you.  You need...  Very much.  You need God to forgive you.  That's why people have been using the church that way politically for years.  Mm-hmm.  When you can't get through with the king or the city hall or whatever you're...  This has been happening since there's been a church.  You get the...  You grease the palm of the church and they go tell everybody.  That God forgave you.  And you can't beat that. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  If you get a clergyman to tell Menino and everybody else in Boston that you're forgiven by God,  basically, he has to let you back in.  Yeah.  Or else he's the devil.  Yeah.  They let us work, uh, back here in New York City after what we did.  Yeah, exactly.  Come on.  He's really got to stop.  It's over.  It's done.  Yep.  It's done.  Let's talk it over.  We're looking for, for, for, uh, forgiveness.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, here's the Eddie Murphy trailer that is driving a lot of people nuts around here.  I have not heard it, but I'm sure it's fine.  Oh, it's horrible.  Well, we've, uh, pointed out over the last year or two that Eddie Murphy, uh, makes the 
[01:33:30]  same movie where it's, Eddie Murphy has...  Mm-hmm.  And it's, no, it's usually, it's like, a new movie starring Eddie Murphy.  And Eddie Murphy.  And Eddie Murphy.  And Eddie Murphy.  It's like, he can't, he's got to play 18 characters in movies now.  Yeah.  I'd love to see a drama like that, you know?  Like, well, you know, Robert Duvall and Robert Duvall.  Robert Duvall.  In the cancer story.  He plays the rapist and the victim. 
[01:34:00]  He's the rapist and the victim and the old man who's dying of cancer.  Well, he's all three of them with prosthetics, but it's not funny.  And he wears a fat suit, but for a dramatic reason, like a drama fat suit.  Well, just when he thought Eddie Murphy couldn't get worse with this whole, you know, and Eddie  Murphy thing.  Listen to this.  On July 11th, it's Eddie Murphy in Eddie Murphy.  Ah, see, in Eddie Murphy.  In Eddie Murphy. 
[01:34:30]  See, now he's inside himself.  It's Eddie Murphy is now.  It's Eddie Murphy.  I can't even say it.  I'm laughing.  The in.  This is outrageous.  Listen, you're not going to believe this.  The in.  On July 11th, it's Eddie Murphy in Eddie Murphy.  You put that thing down, the guy's an inch tall.  You look like a wuss.  This summer, you have superpowers or something?  You have forgotten your weapon.  He's saving the world.  The fate of many depend on me. 
[01:35:00]  That's entirely too much fault.  From the inside out.  Fire!  Yeah, boy, yeah!  Meat Day, rated PG, July 11th.  Here's how this happens.  Here's how this happens.  Here's how this happens.  A couple of comedy movie writers were on the Paramount lot working on some Eddie Murphy  stink bag vehicle.  Mm-hmm.  And they were just like us talking about, does this guy have any move besides Eddie Murphy 
[01:35:30]  and Eddie?  And then somebody else, somebody went, Eddie Murphy in Eddie Murphy.  Like, that's how dumb it is?  Yeah.  And then somebody went, oh, Jesus, that's it.  We're going to make money.  Yeah.  And they backed out, they backed in the actual idea for the movie from, they started with  the tag.  That's how movies are made now.  They started with what's going to be on the poster.  Eddie Murphy in Eddie Murphy.  And then said, all right, we'll have him as a giant robot thing.  Mm-hmm.  And then he'll be controlling him from inside his head.  Yeah.  How do you, how do we get to Eddie Murphy in Eddie Murphy? 
[01:36:00]  In Eddie Murphy.  Yeah.  Because that's just...  We could make it a gay sex movie.  Doesn't matter what it is.  And they went into some executive's office and said, here's the next movie.  Eddie Murphy in Eddie Murphy.  And the guy went, just figure out a way to get to that that makes any sense and we'll  give you money and you'll make it.  That's exactly how that crap happens.  I swear to you, that's how that happened.  That's horrible.  And then they figured out this stupid, and they, oh, just as long as he goes, ha, and  I do want to talk like this with my mouth wide.  And then, of course, when he talks like this, just get him to do those things. 
[01:36:30]  And his little laugh.  And then we make the poster and take another big dump on it.  Sorry.  Jesus.  When did people...  Like, he's a funny guy.  Like, when did he start to become irritating?  Like, what?  Maybe because he never did like a real drama.  I don't like Dreamgirls.  Is that why?  Like, Pryor did dramas.  He was a better actor anyway, but he did dramas.  Yeah.  Like, yeah, he did Lady Sings the Blues.  He did Blue Collar.  Well, it's a huge difference between those guys to me because Pryor was like this really  genuine guy with this great personality and soul and stuff. 
[01:37:00]  Eddie's a really...  He's like an athlete.  To me, he's unbelievably funny when he's funny, but it's just this ability he has.  Yeah.  You know, like when you watch an athlete and you're so in awe of them, you start to think  they must be amazing as a person.  And then they talk and they go, brr.  And you go, wow, you're not even aware of how cool what you do is.  You're not...  Your brain doesn't measure up to your courage.  Eddie's the same.  I mean, he's just basically...  You know, he's a rich guy from Hollywood. 
[01:37:30]  So he used to be this young kid from Brooklyn, but he was driven by hunger to be successful.  He wasn't a guy...  I mean, Eddie Murphy...  Richard Pryor was so full of incredible feelings and thoughts and ideas, and you put him in  a movie and it was great.  So you're saying that he lost his edge?  Yeah.  He just became bored.  He gets a little lazy because you got the money and everything you could imagine.  I mean, I don't know him.  And maybe he's...  You know, the other way is he's just a businessman.  Like, you know, whatever, the guy who owns Kellogg's or the guy who owns Exxon, there are people 
[01:38:00]  like, God, that guy stinks.  Well, no, he's just slamming down the bucks.  This guy's making millions of dollars every year with movies that totally people definitely  go to.  He's got a sustaining box office quotient, but that doesn't make him interesting.  Just makes him a dude with a lot of money.  I don't know how much his movies make because, I mean, obviously people do go to him.  I mean, he doesn't have...  He doesn't do well.  He doesn't have bombs, for the most part.  Yeah.  No, and also he gave up on guys like us who actually liked him when he was a young comic. 
[01:38:30]  He doesn't care about us anymore.  These are for kids.  These movies are for kids.  That's true.  These are multiplex.  This is a...  Can I get two for the Eddie Murphy movie?  They don't even know who even knows this.  Eddie Murphy movie.  Three for Eddie Murphy.  Must see.  That's what you want to do.  Eddie Murphy movie.  All right, let's move on.  We got the gun thing.  We got the car running on vegetable oil.  Oh, wait, I'll be the man's jumping out of the other man's ear.  This looks very funny.  The same man.  How did they do that?  It's hysterical. 
[01:39:00]  How did they get a man to jump out of his own ear?  Why not have him jump out of somewhere else?  It would have been much funnier.  Kies his shoes.  The other Eddie falls out.  Rolls on the back of his pant leg.  GTA?  Yeah, with GTA.  Video games are in the news again.  You play the video games there a little?  Probably not, because you got the kids.  You can't be playing video games.  No, sir.  The new GTA game is just amazing. 
[01:39:30]  Absolutely amazing.  Yeah, it looks great.  You gave a look like, eh?  No, no, no, no.  Nothing.  Uh-oh.  I played that game once.  I just liked walking around town.  I didn't get involved in the crime.  You just walked around.  Stood on the corner for a while.  You just wanted to be a law-abiding citizen in GTA?  I just wanted to be a wallflower on GTA.  You are a weirdo.  Just walking around.  Hop in a cab.  Pay for it.  Yeah, hop in a cab.  Drive the speed limit.  Stop at the red lights.  Yeah.  You could just let the hooker keep her money.  Sure. 
[01:40:00]  All that stuff, sure.  Dude, I tried playing that game once, because we were all in it.  And all I kept doing was backing into the fence.  I wanted to kick my television over.  I was so eerie.  I couldn't control.  No, that's why, seriously, what I really did do was stay out of trouble.  Like, you can tell where the hot spots are.  And every time I heard sirens, I go, oh, okay, I'll just stand over here by this building  and wait for that to go by.  Just stay out of trouble.  See how long you can play the game.  Can you walk around all day and just not be bothered?  Yeah.  I can.  Yes, you can.  I did that.  I did that for like a couple hours.  What's wrong with you?  You've got to be careful you don't bump into anyone, because that could cause all sorts 
[01:40:30]  of problems.  Well, because it's actually pretty predictable.  You hit a guy, and he goes, hey, I'm going to hit you back.  Oh, I'm in a fight now.  All right.  Shoot him.  Shoot him.  And then he goes, ah, and he bleeds.  And then the cops come after you.  It's not that interesting.  But the outskirts of the game, where you stay out of trouble, are actually interesting,  because then you're at the limits of what the writers of the game did, that they didn't  pay as much attention to, like, stand over by a bush.  You know what I mean?  I never realized that.  It's a weird existential corner of the creator of the game's mind, where the stuff he had to 
[01:41:00]  write just in case some idiot didn't shoot anybody.  He decided to just walk around.  Yeah, it's better than, you know, whatever.  Well, let's see what's going on with these six kids out there on Long Island, I believe.  Of course.  Where else would they be from?  Six teens are accused of carrying out a crime spree.  Cops say it was inspired by the popular video game Grand Theft Auto.  Nassau County police say the boys, who range in age from 14 to 18, attacked several people 
[01:41:30]  while trying to copy scenes from the game.  Three of the boys allegedly beat and robbed a man in New Hyde Park.  They later met three others in Garden City, where cops say they forced one driver off the  road and mugged her.  She was able to escape and call police.  The teens are now being charged as adults, adults rather, all face robbery charges.  So, why the G, yes, Danny?  Well, I just love how neither the news nor the Newsday article that reported this story 
[01:42:00]  bothers to tell you that, I mean, the reality of it is that Grand Theft Auto 4 is an M-rated  game.  There's ratings on video games, just like there are movies.  And I think four out of these six kids weren't even of age to even be playing the game in  the first place.  But they'll never tell you that in the news.  No.  No, of course not.  It doesn't matter.  Because video games are bad.  Where the impetus to act like a jerk comes from?  It doesn't matter.  Do you know the game...  I have no idea.  It's like, let's find out why they did it and blame that product.  The game sold, I don't know how many millions of copies. 
[01:42:30]  One.  Perhaps forever.  It only sold one copy?  One copy.  I think it was six million in the first week of sales.  Six million.  Six million?  In the first week.  And you got one of these cases.  And you get something that happens.  I mean, come on.  That's pretty good odds.  There was actually some other Grand Theft Auto news, I think just two days ago, where  remember that whole hot coffee incident from Grand Theft Auto 3, where there was like a  supposed nude scene in there. 
[01:43:00]  Well, they just paid out the settlement.  There was a class action lawsuit.  I think 2,600 people actually wanted the settlement out of how many people actually bought that  game.  It came out to .006% of people were offended by that hot coffee patch.  And the article had went on to tell you that it was really the lawyers making money off  the lawsuit rather than the people who wanted the settlement.  Sure.  So it wasn't even anybody being offended.  It was just another case of lawyers wanting to make more money. 
[01:43:30]  No.  You know when you get like a notice from Apple Computer or something saying somebody sued  us for you?  Yeah.  Here's a penny.  On your behalf.  Yeah.  Class action.  Class action.  What?  What?  Right.  You're offended.  Don't worry.  Here's a penny.  Here's a penny.  What?  We understand what you needed.  Yeah.  What happened?  And meanwhile, the company lost like billions of dollars because they had to dish out pennies  to people that don't want pennies.  Yeah. 
[01:44:00]  To write for your penny, you know, to claim your...  That's weird.  I think the actual figure for Rockstar was they had to pay out, I think something like  $34,000 for that hot coffee suit.  Really?  Yeah.  That's it?  Yeah.  And imagine what they had to spend on their lawyers and everything else.  Give me a break.  Whatever.  Final video games.  Fat cats get fatter.  Yeah.  Regular Joe.  Regular Joe.  No?  Yeah.  That was Regular Joe.  Regular Joe.  I know him anywhere.  Says regular things. 
[01:44:30]  Know what I got in front of me?  Makes regular guy faces that you can't see on the radio.  You know.  Know what I got in front of me that might be...  It's a quick hit, but I think it's worth another...  To play.  Got Louis C.K.  In studio.  Big A and Tippy Tom getting their exams from last Friday.  You know, I didn't hear that.  Oh, my God.  The Tippy Tom.  We'll play that audio before we get out of here.  After the break.  But Big A will be the warm-up act.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve comes in every once in a while to do a radio show.  And his thing for a while was to give exams up the you-know-what. 
[01:45:00]  Prostate exams.  Yeah.  There you go.  I guess we could say that.  And it was Big A's turn.  A lot of guys on staff have taken the exam from Dr. Steve.  And it was time for Big A's.  And this is how it went down.  I picked the worst time to start eating my blueberries.  I may find a few of those myself.  Yeah.  Okay.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  Here we go.  What you got to do is drop your drawers.  And then I need you to...  Don't be so shy. 
[01:45:30]  Let's get that dumper out.  You want to do it in your belt?  Oh, you got to pull the belt down.  That's right.  Drop it.  Attaboy.  You dropped those pants.  All right.  Yeah.  And now, yeah, they got to go down too.  The underwear's got to come down, sweetie.  Yeah.  And then bend over the...  Bend over.  Hold on.  We got to get the mic by Big A's mouth.  And Big A...  And for Ron and Fez, when the...  You got to go Big A, all right? 
[01:46:00]  And hold on.  Take that.  Hold on.  There you go.  Someone...  No, hold on.  I got to move back because I'm doing it.  Here we go.  You.  So there's a...  A nice Big A for Ron and Fez.  There's my finger.  And...  Big A!  Is that the finger going in?  Oh, no.  Like, really?  Oh, you're killing me.  It's like, really?  Sorry.  Yeah, no, it's ridiculous.  But I think... 
[01:46:30]  Stupid rules.  Your timing could have been worse because it was right at the moment, too.  There's no way they looked up.  Oh, man.  I'm sorry.  There's no way.  I don't know about that.  No way.  I will...  How much I got on me, I'll bet anyone, there's no way that made it.  Did it?  Yeah.  You can't talk about anything.  We can say prostate exams.  Got dumped?  It still got dumped.  And it was right at the moment, too.  Right at the moment.  There's no way you can say that.  I think it's ridiculous, but...  Rules are rules.  He said, here's my finger.  And that's it.  Yeah. 
[01:47:00]  You can say that.  Then you can't say what it's doing or anything.  Oh.  Yeah.  But I'm from the school that the listeners are smarter than we give them credit for.  So when you hear, here's my finger, you know what's going on.  No, you're right.  It's about the lawyers not...  No, look.  I don't argue with it.  I just don't know the rules well enough.  No one does.  I don't...  I mean, I don't...  I'm not...  There's no point in arguing like this is stupid or unfair.  It is what it is.  It's just I don't know the rules well enough.  I keep stumbling.  But no one knows you.  I don't want to make the mistakes. 
[01:47:30]  No one knows the rules.  Do you understand?  I know, but if you know any version of them, you stay clear.  You stay well clear of the border.  Don't ever learn the rules.  Because then you're going to lose your edge there, Lou.  Well, no.  Because then you're going to overthink things.  We'd rather have you just doing your thing.  And if they dump out, they dump out.  Here's the moment again because Louie did wreck it.  Sorry.  There you go.  So much...  Now, hold on.  I've got to be back because I'm here with you.  So there's a...  All right, my friend.  A nice big A for Ron and Pez.  There's my finger.  And... 
[01:48:00]  Big A!  All right.  And that's how that went down.  I like right before you can hear him going...  It's like a horse.  Yeah, it is.  A horse who's about to give birth.  Just getting ready.  After the break, we'll try to squeeze in the audio of Tippi Tom, which was a little different.  Tippi Tom might have enjoyed it a little more than Big A did.  And Louie C.K., where are we at?  State Theater tonight. 
[01:48:30]  New Brunswick, New Jersey.  732-246.  Show for tickets.  And let's remind the people, Jimmy.  We've got $10 lawn tickets going on sale for our virus show at the PNC Arts Center August 2nd.  Yes.  About an hour from now, they go on sale on Ticketmaster.  $10 lawn seats.  Only 1,000 of them.  And they're going to go really, really quickly.  So make sure you're calling right at 9 o'clock.  All right.  O.P. and Anthony, Louie C.K., Jim Norton, and you, the listener. 
[01:49:00]  What are you doing this weekend?  Hmm.  That's a good question.  No, I'm listening to the answer.  Oh.  They're telling me now.  Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.  I guess there's a big get-together at FH Riley's.  A big get-together.  My brother, who hasn't been seen at his own restaurant in well over a week.  Wow.  As he recovers from ridiculous surgery.  400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  Somebody will be cooking the food. 
[01:49:30]  My brother, I don't think, is cooking yet.  My brother had his tonsils removed.  And it's safe to say he's way too old to be getting his tonsils removed.  Yeah, that's a kid thing.  He pretty much had his nose broken, and then they scraped out the cartilage in one nostril  so he could breathe again, because he found out that he's only been breathing through one nostril  for a very long time.  Oh.  Then, if that wasn't good enough, they did something with his jaw.  I think they had to, like, kind of like, I don't know, do something, scrape away at the jaw or something. 
[01:50:00]  Was he having this thing when he was, was it collapsing on his throat or something?  Everything was collapsing, yes.  Oh.  Yes.  And then, then the doctor said, you know what, while we're in here, by the way, this all happened  at an office park.  At an office park?  At an office park?  And he left a mere couple hours after the surgery.  He learned that from my dad.  My dad was always all about that.  Uh, and then he had that, that, that punching bag.  What is it called?  The uvula? 
[01:50:30]  Uvula.  Huh?  Uvula.  Uvula.  Uvula.  Uvula.  Uh, cut in half, basically.  Yeah, I can't, I don't know.  But he did it all at once.  He was smart.  He was a little bad munch, and then he's done.  I had an ear, nose, and throat guy tell me, because I get, I used to get sinus infections  all the time.  If I got a cold, it would turn into a sinus infection.  Yeah.  He said, uh, we should go in and, and mess around with your septum and all this stuff in your sinus.  And I go, and I asked him what actually happens.  And he's like, well, we peel your face off, and then we go in and cut a chunk out of your, 
[01:51:00]  your head, and then we sew your face back on.  And I was like, it's all right, I'll have a cold for the rest of my life.  Yeah.  I just didn't want, it just upset me to know how, he said literally, like, they peel back  a large portion of your face and dig in there.  They, they chunk away.  But you know what I do instead?  I use, uh, uh, saline, uh, spray up my nose.  Yeah.  All, like, every day, I use it like snuff.  Oh, really?  I no longer get sinus infections or, or allergies or anything else. 
[01:51:30]  I'm a thousand times healthy.  And it's safe?  Because I just keep washing my nostrils.  Yeah, but mine are messed up.  I can't breathe.  I can't breathe at night.  I actually called my Uncle Mark yesterday.  He's an anesthesiologist.  I'm like, can you recommend someone in New York?  I can't breathe.  I can't breathe, goddammit.  That's exactly how it feels.  Don't get what my brother got done.  I mean, he's going to be all right, but he's in hell.  Doesn't matter.  The first three days, he didn't even sleep.  He, he was like throwing up blood, basically.  He's lost, uh, last I checked, he lost 15 pounds.  There he goes.  The surgery was, the surgery was a mere 10 days ago. 
[01:52:00]  That's too invasive.  And he's, he told me the other day, he's finally on the other side of recovery, but  it's been a complete nightmare.  Can you imagine them cutting your uvula in half?  That's kind of, I think some of these guys are, these doctors are really cavalier with  that stuff.  It's like, I got an irritation on my face.  Oh, let's cut it off.  Really?  I don't know.  It might work.  It's not my face.  I don't care.  His wife wasn't happy when she found out that this was all being done basically in an office  park, you know, where they make little electronics and stuff. 
[01:52:30]  And then there's a doctor doing this crazy surgery.  Right next door, there's a cabinet maker.  Right.  I mean, it was a reputable doctor, so I mean, you know, but still.  So we're, uh, we're thinking about my brother today.  He's still in hell.  Oh.  Still in hell.  He was smart.  Do it all at once.  Get it done.  I don't care if it, if it feels like there are nails being driven into my nose when I  recover.  I don't care how much it hurts.  I got to get it done.  Yeah, then.  All right.  We're not going to see you for a while, but.  Nah, you'll see me in a few days.  I'm fine.  I'll recover quickly.  I'm telling you, they call me the quick recovery kid. 
[01:53:00]  That's my nickname in high school.  Yeah, I would always get surgeries.  Wow.  And recover quickly.  Boom, immediately.  I walk right into the hospital.  You must have gotten the girls with that.  That's right.  One damn Robert Redford.  I heard you recover really quickly from surgery.  That's right.  By the way, I don't want people to think I'm crazy.  I was listening to the answers, and Jeremy from Maine said he was getting married when  I asked what he was doing this weekend, and I forgot his name already, because there's  too many people talking to me now in my head, but another guy's going to go check  out minor league baseball this weekend, so. 
[01:53:30]  Mm-hmm.  And they're still coming in.  What?  I said, what are you doing this weekend?  And the listeners were answering me.  What?  They were, Jimmy.  I'm telling you.  Are you like that girl from Romper Room looking in a mirror and saying, I see Joey?  Yes, that's me.  Wow.  I hear these people.  You're like Pat Robertson or whatever his name is.  Yeah, remember those?  There's a woman in South Dakota whose knee hurts.  Right.  Yeah.  I hate that.  I'm fixing her knee from afar. 
[01:54:00]  And there's a man.  This guy endorses presidents, and people listen.  Yeah, and people listen.  And he shuts his eyes and does that thing.  Oh, there's a man.  There's a man.  The problem with your leg will be taken care of within the next week.  It's like, wow, really?  There's a man in Wisconsin whose foot is asleep.  And I am now waking it up.  It's pins and needles now, and now it's fully awake. 
[01:54:30]  Praise the Lord.  Charlatan.  Have you ever walked down pins and needles, and it hurts so much, you think if a guy was  chasing me with an axe, I would just collapse for him to kill me right now?  I couldn't run if I had to.  I'd point at my foot and go, hit me here.  Hit the foot, please, with the axe.  I love that.  That tingle, it's maddening.  It's the worst thing in the world.  It's maddening.  It really is the silliest thing, because it's maddening.  It's maddening, but then you find yourself laughing, trying to walk on your lame, gimp  leg.  No, it is.  It tickle agonizes. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  All it is.  You put it perfectly.  That tingle is maddening.  Yeah.  Like, you feel a tingle, and you're like, I want my life to end right now.  I really want my life to end.  If I had a gun, I'd shoot myself just to stop this 40-second tingle.  It's the blood returning, I believe.  Yes, it is.  Yeah, it is.  Hey, Anthony, what are you doing this weekend?  Someone wants to know if you're going to the range.  You and Jill.  Has she gone to the range with you yet?  No, I have not.  She's not joined me at the range yet.  Uh-huh. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, we could do that.  Uh-huh.  And then we have a couple of activities, things to do.  Uh-huh.  But, uh, I don't have any plans.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  See, I was just trying to relate to you as a person.  Oh.  See, then you would say, what are you doing?  And then people would think we actually, like, you know, care about each other.  What are you doing?  I'm not telling you.  Why?  No, actually, I was doing the range thing because of the gun thing in D.C.  Yes.  I was actually Sagan, and then I decided just to make it done. 
[01:56:00]  Supreme Court has some common sense.  I have a gun that shoots blanks, and I have a box of blanks.  I didn't hear that.  A box of blanks.  It looks like a 9mm.  Yeah.  I bought it for this little short film I was going to make once, and then I used to use  it when we were upstate.  I used to shoot at deer with it.  With blanks.  With blanks, and they'd just look at me.  Like, we're not getting hit by bullets.  This guy is the lousiest shot ever.  You're pointing right at me.  You're missing loser.  That's psychotic. 
[01:56:30]  What, to have a gun with blanks?  To have a gun with blanks?  To have the crap out of the deer like that.  Why is that psychotic?  You should just kill the deer.  Oh, well, I don't know.  You can't shoot deer from your backyard.  It's illegal.  No one's going to know.  Yeah.  Well.  Who's going to know, really?  I don't obey the law because I don't want to get caught.  I obey the law because it's the right thing to do.  That a boy, Lou.  Mm-hmm.  What's the deer going to do?  Go tell on you, you little fruit?  Who shot you?  The redhead.  The Mexican.  You'd never think he was.  He's dead.  He dies in the police station. 
[01:57:00]  Signing a statement.  Well, for the gun lovers out there, this is what went down in D.C. yesterday.  Biggie.  A landmark ruling for advocates of gun rights.  It's a great day for the city of Washington and for all law-abiding Americans.  With its 5-4 decision to overturn Washington, D.C.'s three-decade-old ban,  the justices have determined all Americans can have handguns.  And I'm very happy that now I'm able to defend myself and my household in my own home. 
[01:57:30]  The decision, a crushing blow for those who say more guns will lead to more violence.  There are too many lives that are tragically lost by accidents and other shootings that  happen because the gun gets in the wrong hands.  In the wrong hands, gun ownership, it's a responsibility.  You have to be responsible.  It's also your right.  And it's like anything else.  It's like driving a car, which isn't even a right.  It's a privilege.  And people drive like idiots and mow down people and kill more people in a year than accidental gunfire. 
[01:58:00]  That's for sure.  So I'm kind of lost.  So what was going on in D.C.?  D.C. had a lot.  You could not own a handgun.  You couldn't.  You weren't allowed to own a handgun.  But people were being shot all over the place down there.  Yes, it's the murder capital of the country.  So that really shows you how gun control really works.  Take every gun.  Make every handgun illegal. 
[01:58:30]  I swear to God, I thought that was the problem.  That they were the first area to allow you to have a handgun.  No.  I had no idea you weren't allowed to have a handgun in D.C.  With all the murder that's going on.  Miserable.  Yeah, but the problem is that you can leave.  You can drive out of D.C. in 20 minutes.  And it becomes an illegal handgun.  Yeah.  The second you cross the state line, it's like, people say that.  Well, you could buy one and then you can go over the state line and then you have one.  Yes, you have an illegal gun. 
[01:59:00]  You've broken the law.  Right.  So now you are not a law-abiding citizen owning a gun which you have a right to own.  You're breaking the law.  And now the law-abiding citizen that would never do that because he knows you're breaking  the law cannot defend himself against you with your illegal gun because you're not allowed  to have a legal one in your house.  Right.  It's crazy.  So they overturned it.  Good.  And now law-abiding citizens in D.C.  I'm sure they're going to have to jump through so many hoops like they do everywhere else, 
[01:59:30]  especially in New York, are going to be able to own a handgun.  Do you mind all the hoops?  And defend themselves.  All the hoops you've got to jump through to get a gun?  Absolutely.  I mind a lot of them.  I think, of course, a background check.  Yeah.  I'm not silly.  I don't want to dole out guns to lunatics.  A background check seems just like...  I think the car thing, a driver's license, is the perfect corollary.  I think that that should be...  And it's the same.  When you have a license, you have to keep proving every few years that you're a responsible 
[02:00:00]  driver.  License.  Right.  You have to be responsible.  A lot of states have gun safety courses you have to take before they'll issue you.  You have to do a license.  So then there should be an expiration date, I think, on a gun license.  Yeah, there are.  But I think that that should be the way it is.  I mean, it's hard because we live in an imperfect world and most people are douchebags.  Most people are idiots.  So it's just the way it is.  And it's just this thing...  I don't know.  When people live in the country and have guns, it's like a hammer.  It's just a tool. 
[02:00:30]  It's just...  Yeah.  It's not that big a deal.  You're right.  It's like anything else.  But you do have a constitutional right to own these things.  Yeah, by the way, it's the Second Amendment.  It's not like it's like the 48th obscure amendment.  It's the Second Amendment.  The Second Amendment.  You've got to be able to say whatever you want.  And then shoot whoever doesn't like it.  And then shoot whoever doesn't like what you said.  I want to be in a house saying, F you, with a gun in my lap.  That's what I want.  That's the basic American rights. 
[02:01:00]  That is pretty much what the founding fathers wanted.  Yeah.  And there's people who live in cultures that are not gun cultures.  And it's offensive to them because they don't know what it means to have that.  And, you know, just like there's people who think that you're supposed to just parrot Jesus' words at each other.  Yeah.  And so they don't get how important it is to be able to say whatever you want.  These anti-gun advocates are ridiculous if they can't see that a gun ban in D.C. and in Chicago, by the way, does nothing. 
[02:01:30]  It hasn't done anything.  It doesn't deter crime.  If they're talking about accidental shootings, that happens.  It does.  And, again, you've got to be responsible.  You've got to be so responsible with a gun.  Some people aren't responsible enough.  They're just not.  I know I'm not responsible enough to have a gun.  Really?  Yeah.  I would just.  Something dumb would happen.  I wouldn't trust you with a peach. 
[02:02:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Get that peach away from Opie.  Oh, my God.  He's pointing at me.  I'm clumsy.  Yeah.  Something dumb would happen.  Yeah.  Just clumsy.  You've got to know.  I would kick it and it would fire and hit my neighbors.  I get nervous with my fake gun.  Really?  I keep the blanks box in one corner of the apartment and then I have the magazine that they go into.  Like, I don't want to keep this stuff in one corner.  You have to be very, very familiar with it.  And he should be nervous about that.  Who died because of it?  Oh, John Eric Hexum years ago.  Who?  John Eric Hexum. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, who was the actor, too?  He was the actor.  The kid?  No, Brandon Lee got shot.  Well, he did, too.  I was thinking Brandon Lee.  I was thinking John Eric Hexum.  What's that story?  He was filming a TV series he was on and he put a blank gun to his head and pulled the trigger.  Idiot.  And the charge dislodged a piece of his skull as if it was a bullet and put it right through his brain.  Dead idiot.  Dead fool.  There's a charge that explodes when you do that.  Oh, yeah.  A blank is...  A big, nasty, orange flame comes out the front.  A blank is nothing but a bullet without the lead in it. 
[02:03:00]  Without the lead.  But so it fires like the powder?  Oh, yeah.  And you still get the same energy coming out of the barrel.  So if something's at the front of the barrel, like your skull, it's just going to bust out and go through your brain.  But he thought it was like a little...  Yeah, I don't know what he thought.  He shot himself in the head with his head.  Right.  Yeah.  He used his own head to kill himself.  Because he's stupid.  And he's probably smarter now than when he was alive.  Yeah.  Let's go to the second part of the gun story down there in D.C. 
[02:03:30]  You got the candidates commenting.  A carefully worded statement from Barack Obama tonight.  He suggests the court isn't saying you can't have common sense gun laws, just that this particular case violates a basic principle.  John McCain calls the ruling a recognition that gun ownership is a sacred fundamental right.  Sacred.  Sacred is getting a little...  Sacred.  Yeah, get a hold of yourself.  Call it that.  I say call it sacred because people don't understand.  Boy, you know, that audio was very surprising.  Yeah, very surprising.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:04:00]  Well, those dudes are really, you know...  It is weird, though.  About as sincere as your apology to the Menino.  All right.  Hey, the Supreme Court one day rules very liberal that you can't put the child molesters, child rapists to death.  And then this conservative ruling, it's really weird.  Yeah, this isn't even really a conservative ruling.  This is a constitutional...  No, both of these rulings, both of those rulings are actually good Supreme Court behavior because  they're both saying, regardless of how people are upset about something right now, you can't 
[02:04:30]  just start changing stuff.  You can't...  There's a basic...  There's a line you can't cross with the death penalty, and there's a fundamental ancient  basic right to handguns.  And regardless of the statistics of today or how things are going in D.C. or how mad people  are about these, you can't change stuff.  Yeah.  And it's the same thing with, yes, child molestation is, you know, on the rise, but you still can't...  You can't start killing people for a crime that's getting particularly rampant and repulsive 
[02:05:00]  to people if it's not murder.  Well, don't forget, why can't you, though, when this was written...  This was not written by...  This was just written by guys.  Like, it's not like this is this...  Why should this document be so completely unchangeable and sacred when it was written  by...  We all know slave owners.  Well, because when you change law, like, you just let it rock back and forth and pendulum  back and forth, I think it's dangerous to do that.  I think it's good that you can't...  Then it's not worth the paper it's written on.  But it's supposed to be changeable. 
[02:05:30]  It's supposed to be...  To what extent?  There's going to be a day when you're going to, like, get...  I don't know.  You don't drink, right?  You're like a sober guy, aren't you?  Yes.  Like a sober guy.  One day, the right woman's going to drive you back into the bottle.  You're going to have a bad night.  And you're going to wake up in a kiddie park, not realizing where you passed out with wood chips  on your face.  And you're going to pee on a fire engine toy.  And there's going to be a kid standing there watching you pee.  And next thing you know, you're on death row. 
[02:06:00]  That's going to happen.  Yeah, right?  There you go.  There's this basic line you didn't...  That you got to let...  I'll take that chance.  The odds of those things happening, if I wind up doing that and get caught, I deservedly  put to death.  Because a fire truck is only every boy's right.  They're also talking about New York City's laws, their gun laws.  And Mayor Bloomberg, of course, is saying that this shouldn't affect New York City, which  by the way, is just a pain in the ass to get a pistol license in. 
[02:06:30]  But you can get one here.  You need to show cause.  You need to have a reason.  You can't just say, my reason, because there are lunatics running around and they have  guns.  Why can't I?  You know, I'm willing to get a background check.  How'd you get one?  I have a New York State license.  I cannot carry my gun in the city.  Oh, right.  Okay.  So I'm, you know, there's supposed to be certain people working on that. 
[02:07:00]  I haven't heard anything yet, but, um, you know, because it's one of those things.  It's, it should be your right.  It's, I think, uh, I think they're, they're, um, screwing up here in New York City.  I think it's, uh, against the second amendment and I hope the DC thing sets a precedent and  Chicago, people in Chicago are able to, uh, uh, get handguns and I, I hope they make it  easier in New York for law abiding citizens.  I'm talking people that are responsible and go through the system and are able to 
[02:07:30]  then, uh, uh, possess a handgun.  This is an example of how like old, old ideals, uh, carry through time.  The way that dictators, um, uh, take over countries, they use laws.  They don't do it through like, like Hitler, uh, used law.  He played it perfectly.  Parliamentary process in order to become chancellor.  All of a sudden he was the head muck and he muck. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  So handed to him.  So he changed laws arbitrary, like he changed laws cause he was able to, he had a large powers.  So he just said, okay, uh, everybody turn in your weapons.  You disarm this first.  The two things you do when you take over a country as a dictator is you shut people up and  you take away their weapons.  You say, everybody has to bring, if you're found with a gun, uh, you go to jail.  That's a new law.  We just made it up.  Okay.  Next law.  If you say these salacious things, you go to jail. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Those two things lead the next day.  You're, you're Hitler.  And that's absolutely what you can't do that in America.  You just can't do it.  You can't tell people you can't say something and you can't tell people, well, you can,  it's, but it's, that's why, that's why they put it in the constitution to protect the American  people against a tyrannical government because the government has to know, holy crap, these  people are armed, but it was the same people that got England thrown out of here just by  having their hunting rifles with them and houses. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Everyone is armed.  We're crazy.  If we think we can just sweep over these people and, and be a tyrannical government.  It was to protect from basically an external force coming into not, I mean, I'm not against  guns.  No, but also, no, it's not external force.  It was really protecting against their own, from their own government.  Because they saw, they saw how that worked in England where, you know, they were.  And it's the same thing with the government's ability to, to punish people by death.  Right.  Using laws against the citizens.  But if you have, if you have guns to protect yourself from your own government, why all of 
[02:09:30]  a sudden can't you change the laws?  Because, like, if that's how bad things can get, why is it so out of the realm of possibility  or to change the law?  Well, that's the whole thing.  It would be bad because they'd be changing the laws.  Because we have an iron, because we have a constitution that we keep going back to.  So you can't, you just can't, as a, as a new leader say, okay, no more guns.  You just can't do it.  And you can't say, okay, you can't say these things.  Because the constitution is so bedrock.  But you know what?  The constitution is overrated.  That's why when things change, you don't want to...  It's overrated. 
[02:10:00]  I don't think so.  It really is.  When you, when you look at it, I mean, a lot of it was great.  Yeah.  But some of it, eh, might be a bit outdated.  It was written by a bunch of guys protecting their own interests at that time.  I don't, I think fundamentally it's pretty good.  Yeah, I agree.  It's worth, it's worth defending.  Yeah.  There's a certain point, but...  From, from decade to decade, it holds up better than a new, than a, somebody with a fiery  speech ability, uh, to, to just change stuff.  Uh, sorry, that music means I gotta shut up, right?  Uh, well, it's alright.  Look, it's, it's off mouth. 
[02:10:30]  I'm boring.  It's a loud mouth.  No, that was...  You're a loud mouth.  Not at all.  That's a good, that's a good set, and, uh, we should continue with that discussion, uh,  down the road, absolutely.  Yeah, I can't even get, I, I really am not against guns.  I just think that the NRA is like, alright, already, we get it.  No, they are, I think there's douchebags on both sides.  I think that guy from that clip was going like, I'm glad now I can defend, nothing's, nothing's  ever happened to him.  Nothing ever will happen to him.  You never know.  But he's enjoying, I, I'm glad I now get to have a gun and an erection without people 
[02:11:00]  bothering me.  Guns are great to have.  It's a great feeling of security.  Yeah.  It's great to go to the range, blast off some rounds.  I think a lot of people that want to have guns are, are stupid and they're morons.  But then there's people who aren't.  Guess which one you are.  I'm still trying to figure that one out.  We all are.  All right, Louis C.K., State Theater tonight, New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Tickets through, well, just give this number a call, 732-246-SHOW. 
[02:11:30]  And for us, O&A, Trial and Virus, August 2nd, PNC, Jersey.  Lawn tickets go on sale today in a mere two minutes.  $10 lawn seats while they last.  I think we've got only 1,000 of those, so they're going to go very quickly.  So, well, I'm sure people are already calling Ticketmaster and trying to get through.  So, you do that.  And don't forget, Louis, this afternoon, Louis is doing the Unmasked.  Unmasked at comics at 1 p.m.  Comics here in New York, if you want to see Louis C.K. for free.  It's a real interview.  It's a one-hour interview with Ron Bennington, sometimes over an hour. 
[02:12:00]  It's a great, great interview.  I'm excited about it.  And it's 14th Street and 9th Avenue.  9th Avenue.  Okay, comics.  They do a very good job down there.  We've got to get out of here.  You guys have a good weekend.  We'll see you soon.  Yep.  Well, what the hell is that?  Let it be known I didn't cue them, by the way.  I didn't go and go.  They just decided to do that.  That is something. 
[02:12:30]  Decided to do that on their own.  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  We've got, obviously, a very big audience checking out the show.  Louis C.K. made the walkover.  And Louis C.K. is the Dump King, everyone.  The Dump King.  Always.  Where's Club Soda Kenny?  Did he run out yet?  Can we get...  We need Club Soda Kenny to do the dump sheet.  I was wondering if we could get somebody else to do it.  Who?  Who?  I don't know.  I don't have anybody in particular.  I'm just saying maybe a member of the audience because he's gone.  No, here he is.  Oh, okay.  Um, wow. 
[02:13:00]  We would have had a perfect show today if Louis C.K.  Where are you?  I'm like, oh, there I am.  Okay.  We would have had a perfect show today, Louis, if you didn't show up.  God damn it.  But you did bring the funny.  I'm glad to be on non-dump radio.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten dumps for Louis C.K.  Wow.  Fuck.  This is ten dumps.  You're like my favorite German porno.  All I did was say drink sperm with your asshole. 
[02:13:30]  You'd have to say guzzle.  Let's make this official.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Hello, everyone.  It's Club Soda Kenny with the Dump Report.  Just talked to me on a dead mic.  It's Club Soda Kenny with the Dump Report, starring Louis C.K.  Thank you.  7.22 a.m.  Louis gets off to a good start. 
[02:14:00]  You pooped your pants on my body.  Backed up by diarrhea that came out of your anus.  Two minutes later, diarrhea on top of the chocolate.  Okay.  Backed up by diarrhea dispenser.  Okay.  And a triple threat.  Splurge diarrhea all over your food.  Okay. 
[02:14:30]  And then another one.  Four times in 7.24.  That was a great minute.  Diarrhea goes all over your Rocky Mountain chocolate.  Co-starring Anthony on that line.  Thank you.  Yes.  There you go.  Honored.  8.22 during the audio of Big A getting his prostate exam.  Is that the finger going in?  A question by Louis C.K.  A question unheard by most of America. 
[02:15:00]  8.45.  Louis said douchebags.  Which they say everywhere, but for some reason we can't say that on radio.  Why can't we say douchebags?  I'll tell you why, and I can picture his fucking kickable face.  That's why.  We all know who, and he sucks.  He's not helping anyone.  No, he doesn't.  E-Rock.  No.  No?  No.  Helping anyone.  When you said kickable face.  Oh, no, no, no.  But douchebag is actually E-Rock, but it's a proper noun when you say it about him.  8.55, Louis said douchebags again.  Yep, didn't I? 
[02:15:30]  8.56, the last dump by Louis C.K.  I can have a gun and an erection?  Are you kidding me?  You can't say erection.  You can't say erection, Louis.  You can't say erection.  Oh, stop it.  That shouldn't have been dumped.  You can't say erection.  You just can't say where you're putting it.  What about the ad?  Why can't you say that?  I know.  But you can talk about erectile dysfunction, and you can talk about...  If you're making money off the dirty words, then it's acceptable.  Yes, that's how it works.  You can say erection.  I'm serious. 
[02:16:00]  Well, you're right.  Bob Dole can say it.  Right.  With his old, crackly erection.  If there's money in it, they'll let you say it.  I'm telling you.  Wow.  You should say, look, I got $100.  I'm going to say erection.  Here you go.  Wow.  And they'll run in and grab your money.  I'm going to open a diarrhea store so I can say diarrhea.  Let's hear it for Club Soda Kenny doing what he does.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Yeah.  And I told you this when we were in Bonnaroo, by the way.  I was, you know, me and Jimmy were at Bonnaroo together. 
[02:16:30]  And I was sitting with the other comedians, Zach Galifianakis and these comedians who don't  know Jimmy well.  They like him, don't know him well.  And we're all at a picnic table.  And they all kind of asked, like kind of gently asked me, how come Jimmy has a bodyguard?  They looked at me like, we can ask Louie.  We know him.  Why does Jimmy have a bodyguard?  And I was like, I don't know.  I think he got death threats once.  And they're like, oh, okay.  And I'm like, all right.  Got rid of that.  But it's also, because Kenny's more than just a...  No, he's like your tour manager, right? 
[02:17:00]  He's a...  Yeah.  He takes care of everything.  But also, I knew I was doing certain outside stuff, like going into the crowds and interviewing  people, and it's like, you don't, you know, they're animals.  No, I don't blame you.  It's just because he's sort of like, kind of pot smoking alternative comics, just thought  it was weird.  They don't like me anyway.  I mean, Zach, you know, but they come out, let's be honest.  They don't fucking dig me.  They think I'm a douchebag and...  Fuck them.  In the mouths.  But I like Zach.  Yeah, Zach's funny.  And Janine said hello, so no one was rude to me.  Sorry, too.  Yeah.  All right, so I'm complaining for nothing. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Everybody was nice.  We've been Brian Posehn.  We've been saving...  Brian Posehn's okay.  I know he is.  We've been saving some audio for your next visit, Louie.  Okay.  A little surprise here, by the way.  Oh, okay.  We didn't even tell you about this one.  Some guy named, I don't know, Eastside Dave.  I don't know who the fuck this guy is, but...  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  I have no idea who he is, but he had a lot to say about you, sir.  Oh, okay.  Oh, no.  Wow, I do remember this now.  And he's hiding today, because we're like, why don't you come in and confront Louie CK with  your words, but he supposedly has something to do for Unmasked. 
[02:18:00]  Okay.  No, Ronnie has a lot to do for Unmasked.  You have nothing to do.  Right.  For Unmasked.  Yeah, what does Dave have to do?  Is he going to be there when I do this on this thing?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's part of it?  No, I don't...  I think he's a...  Well, I haven't seen this stuff.  Yeah, exactly.  He sits to find folks.  Okay.  You know, he walks around and goes, here, you're sitting here.  He's a fucking woman.  Yeah.  Okay, so what did he say?  Did he say this on this show, or this is on his show?  On Ron and Fez.  He was completely sober when he was saying this stuff.  Okay. 
[02:18:30]  And this is Eastside Dave going off on you.  Lou, are you all right?  I hate that guy.  I hate him.  I hate him.  I recognize his value to this show.  All right, where are we at?  Iraq, what did you give me?  The first track is what set Dave off.  This is what I said about Eastside Dave.  All right, supposedly you started.  Okay.  I didn't know that.  So this is you talking about Eastside Dave.  All right, sorry.  Needed the setup.  Lou, are you all right?  I hate that guy.  I hate him.  I hate him. 
[02:19:00]  I recognize his value to this show, and I understand he's funny, but I can't take it.  I can't take it.  He's just like a circus clown on our show.  He actually does real good radio for Ronnie and Fez.  Oh, I know.  I totally get that.  For us, he's just a circus boy, really.  The thing is that he kind of has the same coloring as me, and that's what bothers me, I think.  He looks like he's related.  If I was doing that.  Yeah.  Right.  Oh, so you're kind of thinking like, yeah.  You're kind of still thinking.  He's fucking up our people, you know. 
[02:19:30]  The redheads.  Yeah.  You remind me of me a lot when I was a kid.  Kid.  You know this movie I'm doing, when they ask me to shave, and when they do my hair, they  stick it way out, and I dress in a disgusting wife beater and sweatpants.  Yeah.  And I'm playing a really disgusting loser.  That's my role in the movie.  And once they did my whole thing, I looked in the mirror, I'm like, I'm Eastside Dave.  That's what I am.  I'm playing Eastside Dave.  In a movie.  And he's actually informed the character I'm playing in the movie. 
[02:20:00]  Like, I think about him.  That's helping.  I get a little sick.  And then I do it.  You're researching your part.  All right.  We're back live.  So you started, supposedly.  Yeah.  Okay.  You just don't like him.  What day was that?  When he was pulling something out of his ass?  I think he stuck a lollipop.  I mean, like, it matters.  He stuck a lollipop of his asshole.  He was naked.  Yeah.  And then he ate it and then threw up into a bucket.  So I guess I chafed at that a little for some odd reason that it, you know, bummed me out.  All right.  Eastside Dave started with Patrice. 
[02:20:30]  He had something to say about Patrice first.  Patrice is a good guy.  No, you know what?  He's not a good guy.  I try to say hi to him every fucking time he's in here.  He ignores me.  Just because I shoved a dildo in my ass and a bagel in my ass.  That bothered him.  He was bothered by that.  So what?  Yeah.  Patrice doesn't like white boy fun.  Right.  Right.  No, I'm serious.  Eastside Dave does what we call white boy fun.  Dumb fraternity crap.  And Patrice is like, what is wrong with the white boys? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  I wouldn't expect Patrice to like that.  No.  He's like, this is deeply disturbing.  Why are you guys laughing as he's trying to take shit out of his own ass?  Yeah.  And it's just for the goof.  Sure.  All right.  And then finally, Dave got into you.  To a black guy.  What?  Wait a minute.  Louis C.K.  He has a thought.  Sam.  Yep.  What did he say about me?  He didn't like you.  Louis C.K. says he doesn't like me.  And then he says he's acting in a movie.  Oh, no, no, no.  Come on, Tito.  He's acting in a movie and his inspiration is Eastside Dave. 
[02:21:30]  What the fuck does that mean?  So he hates me.  Well, you know what, Louis C.K.?  I'm coming for you.  I'll fucking hunt you down, bitch.  Anytime you want, Ron Fez show, noon to three.  It's getting in a squared circle.  See, now, he has his opportunity right now.  He said he would hunt you down.  You are here.  Where is Eastside Dave?  Easy to hunt you down.  Exactly.  You're a fucking, you're a pheasant sitting here with your feet up on the desk.  I was scheduled to be here.  Yeah.  I didn't have to track me. 
[02:22:00]  There's no real surprise here.  Yes.  It was on the schedule for about a week.  And then he continued.  He had to sing a song to you.  Oh, my God.  Does even Louis C.K. know where he is?  He's in the jungle, baby.  You're in the jungle, baby.  You're going to die.  Get in the ring, motherfucker.  You heard me, Billy.  Or, Louie.  You heard your fucking name, Billy.  You heard me, Billy.  Yeah! 
[02:22:30]  Put your headphones on.  That's it.  I'm going to get you, Louis C.K.  I'm going to fucking make you pay, bitch.  I'm going to fucking get you like St. Louis riots, 92.  Slap your ass around like that famous photographer.  What is Dave babbling about?  And that's the reaction we were hoping for.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Because that's what is he doing.  But he continued with his song.  Okay. 
[02:23:00]  Me in the jungle.  Welcome to the jungle.  That's in there.  I'm going to fuck you up, Louis C.K.  I'm going to get you, Louis.  Serpentines like poison and snakes.  Woo!  Come on, Slash.  Come on.  Oh, Axl Rose is the fucking best.  Woo!  Come on, Louis!  You fucking bald HBO prick.  Welcome to the jungle.  Ouch. 
[02:23:30]  Hey, Dave, my day.  This is the best impossible.  Say this, the first day.  Holy shit.  Can we at least get him on the phone?  Bald HBO prick?  Is that what he said?  Yeah, something like that.  Okay.  Hey, Dave, tell us how you really feel.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, hey, regular Joe.  Yeah, regular Joe.  Well, maybe we shouldn't play the rest then.  Is there more?  There's a few more.  It's very hurtful.  Yeah, it's very hurtful to Lou.  It's hurting my feelings a little bit.  Hey, no Jogo.  Louis C.K. is in Jogo. 
[02:24:00]  He's going to deal with me someday, baby.  With my cock.  With my Valtrex cock, baby.  I see.  This Valtrex cock.  Wow.  Slash again.  Come on, Slash.  Thanks for the narration.  Is it high, you never?  Louis C.K.  So fast.  So fast.  So fast.  So fast. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  You say I gave a bad name to Redheads, Louis C.K.?  You give a bad name to Redheads, you fat print.  Welcome to the Jogo, Louis.  I want to fuck you up, baby.  Wow.  That was actually musically pretty.  It was almost right on.  It was all right.  He was getting the actual rose sound.  He was expecting the guitarist, too, and giving him his... 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He was shutting up for the guitar solo.  Yeah.  Very important.  I don't know.  Well, Eastside Dave decided not to confront you.  Yeah.  This is a guy that...  Well, should I respond to this?  Put stuff in his ass, by the way.  Not yet, because we've got another clip here.  You know what I'm asking, Louis?  You're all cock and balls, baby.  I'm going to fuck you.  I'm going to piss.  Never heard this version.  Well, you get the box set.  You know, it's on the box set.  Come on, Louis. 
[02:25:30]  Come on, Tucker.  57th Street in Manhattan.  Here we are.  I know you live in New York, Suey K.  Suey K.  Yeah.  We're in the jungle.  Welcome to the jungle.  I'm going to bring me the son of ours.  Louis, see you.  Yes, please, please.  Welcome to the jungle.  Welcome to the jungle.  Welcome to the frogs and snakes. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Jungle.  Welcome to the jungle.  Oh, for the love of Christ, turn it off.  Stop this song.  It's almost over.  It's almost over.  Welcome to the jungle.  Louis, see you.  I'm going to fuck you with my dildo.  I'll kill you, Louis.  Yeah.  And a lot of people saying that he was whacked and drunk and stuff.  No.  No, no.  I was there.  He was stone sober that day. 
[02:26:30]  Sounds like it.  I just want to make that perfectly clear.  Sure.  One more quick clip, and then we'll get Louis' response.  What other comics are we working down there?  Louis C.K.  He's great.  Yeah.  You're right.  What?  Fuck him.  Oh, yeah.  Forget that.  I don't know what happened, because Louis C.K. asked me what Dave was saying about him,  because apparently he'd gotten messages that he said about him.  I'm sure Dave went crazy.  He got messages that he got pwned on the Ronald Feds show. 
[02:27:00]  Can we please never use the term pwned?  I don't even like when it's written, but I really hate when it's said.  And there you go.  Okay.  I'm very obsessed with you, Lou.  Well, look, you know.  Are you flattered?  Yeah, here's the thing.  I feel bad.  I'm sorry about what I said about him.  I mean, you may be surprised.  Probably it's better radio if I come back with a lot of vitriol and hatred.  No, no, no.  Of course not.  I feel bad that I hurt his feelings.  That sounds like somebody who's really hurt. 
[02:27:30]  That's like somebody who I made him feel so bad that he sat down and worked on that song.  And so I'm sorry.  I really am.  I don't, you know, look, when somebody shoves a lollipop up their ass and then eats it and vomits in front of me, it kind of bums me out a little bit.  But that's not to say that he's not a very, look, I congratulate him on his wedding.  I heard he got married recently.  Had a kid?  A year ago? 
[02:28:00]  That's all great.  And, you know, and he obviously, like I said, during insulting him, he adds a lot of value to this show and their show.  And so, Mr. Cy to David, I, you know, I apologize.  I retract what I said about him.  Oh, no.  Wow.  I don't hate him.  Why are you doing that?  It's because, you know, I don't want to hurt a guy's feelings.  He's going to get off on this, though.  Seems like a nice guy.  That's fine.  I don't care if he masturbates to it.  I don't care if he jizzes all over his stomach to me saying, I'm really sorry, Eastside Dave, for saying I hate you. 
[02:28:30]  Well, that could be his next trick.  Right.  Ronnie plays this audio, and Eastside Dave has to jack off and shoot warm jizz all over his belly.  That's fine.  That would be a perfect stunt for Eastside Dave.  I'm sure he's got a lot of glazed, you know, covers on his belly of many jizz shots.  And, but no, I think he seems like a fine guy, and I shouldn't have said what I said.  Message delivered and heard, and I'm afraid of you. 
[02:29:00]  I'm sad to be in the jungle.  Please let me out of the jungle.  I ask for safe passage out of the jungle.  And you don't have a real gun, so you can't really shoot him while you're in the jungle.  No, I can shoot blanks at him and make him flinch, but I can't really hurt him.  That's about all you can do if you were listening early.  Yeah.  I retract my earlier statements in regards to Mr. Eastside David of the Ron and Fez show. 
[02:29:30]  Wow.  I regret any harm that I caused him, and I wish him luck with all of the foodstuffs and  otherwise that he puts inside of his asshole, and then eats and then vomits while naked and  masturbating in front of people.  I wish him luck in all of that.  I want to do a Back to the Future thing, because there is a very good possibility that Ronnie's  now playing this audio, and Eastside Dave is jerking off as he listens to you.  Okay, so you're jerking off right now, listening to me, and I'm sorry. 
[02:30:00]  And I just want you to picture me kneeling in front of you, looking up at you, saying  sorry, and you just coming all over my sorry face.  I can actually jerk off to that.  Who can't?  Two redheaded guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One coming on the other's face.  One straightening out the other one.  Straightening.  That's right.  Exactly.  Redhead humiliation four.  And one of my eyes closes, because it's all stingy.  Yeah.  But I keep taking it.  That's right.  I take it like a champ.  That's right.  You'll lap that cock head like a puppy.  That's right.  It's fine.  I got no dog in this fight. 
[02:30:30]  You know?  All right.  I'm not going to stick to my guns.  The last thing I'm going to do is go, well, but he...  Yeah, yeah.  He can't be going back and forth.  How dare he say I'm in a jungle?  The likes of him.  How dare he sing along to that song and say, fuck me?  Like a lunatic.  I'm not going to take that lying down.  No.  He wins.  Complete madman.  Eastside Dave, you win as you sit there jerking off in front of Ron and Fez.  Wonderful.  You're right and I'm wrong.  All right.  And you're doing Unmasked today with Ron Bennington at one o'clock at Comics. 
[02:31:00]  I forgot the address.  14th and 9th Avenue.  All right.  We got this to play real fast.  Traveling Virus 2008.  Saturday, August 2nd at the PNC Bank Art Center.  Art Center.

We're going to take a quick break.  We can get the audience inside and continue with the Opie and Anthony show with Louis C.K.  I forgot your plug.  It's the State Theater.  He's working at the State Theater.  It's okay.  State Theater.  It was July 10th in New Brunswick, right?  New Brunswick.  Yeah, big fucking whoop.  State Theater tonight. 
[02:33:00]  Tonight.  Tonight.  Jesus, I didn't mean to do that.  Tonight.  I'm off by the wrong month.  Yeah, State Theater tonight with Louis C.K.  Tonight.  All new jokes.  Yeah.  All new shit.  I saw the hour.  It's great.  Thank you.  It's very, very good.  All right.  We'll continue.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Jesus. 
[02:33:30]  Boy, these people are going to be very disappointed in a minute now.  Yeah.  All that energy, and then they're going to be leaving.  See, it's nice to...  That's no fucking big deal.  A lot more women than normal.  Damn, a lot of people here.  That's what I thought about.  Oh, hi.  How are you in the bow?  You with a guy?  Yes, I am.  All right.  All right, hold on.  Where's that mic there?  Huh?  Why would the wireless work?  Try it again.  Yes, I am.  There you go.  Okay, and Miss, you guys are a nice little couple, right?  I've never met him before in my life. 
[02:34:00]  Are you kidding?  I've never met him before.  You're just sitting on the couch for no reason with almost Troy Aikman?  Yes.  Sharing a chair with a strange man.  Oh, she's a lovely girl.  She's wearing a short skirt, sharing a chair with a man she's never met.  It is.  I thought they were shorts.  Could you move your bag?  I don't think I can.  No, no, I won't look.  It's all right.  I'll show you later.  Can you move?  Really?  What a trooper.  She doesn't know the show, Jim.  She doesn't know.  What's that?  She doesn't know the show.  Oh, really? 
[02:34:30]  Miss, what brings you to the studio?  I was lying.  He brought me here.  We're not together.  Oh, you got me.  Oh, boy.  Now I have to bite your face.  So what's your little tattoo on your foot?  It's very sexy.  Oh, it's for track.  It's the foot with the wings.  Does it make you go faster, actually?  Yeah.  How great would it be if Christopher Reeve had one of those?  I know.  Too soon.  Fuck off.  No, that was an O in appreciation. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, okay.  They did fully enjoy that.  Nobody gets offended by that.  So what, Christopher Reeve?  So what?  So what?  Couldn't move, and now he really can't move.  He's fucking dead.  Now he's so paralyzed that he's fucking dead.  It's basically not even a big switch for him.  What I'm going to do is straighten him out and just turn his head off.  That's right.  That is the ultimate paralysis. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking dead asshole.  I bet he didn't even bury him.  He'd probably just leave him around the house.  That's how we remember him.  So let's just hit him up for money every once in a while.  Young Sam Roberts, everyone.  He's coming in the studio, so he must have something for the radio show.  Sam, what do you got for the show today?  You brought us tomato guy yesterday that kind of put the whole show in nothingness.  Fucking awful mood.  Yeah.  I thought it was all right.  What do you got today, young Sam? 
[02:36:00]  I was going to videotape some people if you made them do funny things, and then edit those  videos and put them on the website.  Who wants to do something funny that could be a YouTube...  They're actually...  Hold on.  Rosie O'Donnell, what do you want to do?  It was that headband.  What do you want to do?  Yeah.  Jimmy Norton, I want to touch butts with you.  How old are you?  17. 
[02:36:30]  That's a guy?  Seriously, I thought when you said Rosie O'Donnell, like, don't be mean to that lady.  This is a tender time frame.  I can't because you're 17.  However, had you come here five years ago?  You think I'm going right?  I go left.  And what about the other guy who wants to do something?  Whatever you want me to do.  We hate that.  Oh, come on.  It's whatever you want me to do, guy. 
[02:37:00]  We're not big fans of the whatever you want us to do.  Why not?  We like when you guys come up with something.  I'll touch butts with Jimmy.  Jump out the fucking window, copycats.  Who are you?  My name is Will, and I'm from South Jersey.  Hi, Will.  How are you doing?  Hey, I don't care.  There's another mic in front of you there.  And who's the young lady hiding right here behind this gentleman?  Someone that doesn't want to talk.  Hi.  Hi.  Okay.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:37:30]  She's just falling apart.  I know.  She's shy.  Hi, I'm Glenda.  Hi.  You watch that?  I'm Glenda.  Hi.  Hi, Glenda.  Hi.  Where's Glenda from?  I'm from Connecticut.  From what?  From Connecticut?  Connecticut?  Oh, my God.  That was part of the Soviet Union.  Connecticut?  Connecticut had an accent like that?  What's the accent?  From Connecticut?  What?  You said you're from Connecticut.  What is that, Lou?  What's your color?  I'm Puerto Rican. 
[02:38:00]  What?  Yeah.  Yeah?  You don't look Puerto Rican, though.  What does that mean, Louie?  But then again, Louie doesn't look Mexican.  I don't look Mexican.  Louie C.K. is Mexican.  Is he really?  Puerto Rican.  You're Puerto Rican with some weird accent.  Even she's looking at me going, you can't be Mexican.  Yeah, she just put the most puzzled look on her face.  She's a really white Puerto Rican.  Yeah.  How are you Puerto Rican?  Explain that.  But, no, my mom's family.  One Puerto Rican fucked another one. 
[02:38:30]  Thank you.  You think, you know.  Well, that never happens.  You think a bit darker skin, darker hair, bigger butt.  She's got white relatives.  What's the accent from, though?  It's just, I don't know, Spanish.  But I went to school in France.  I spent, you know, quite a bit there, too.  You speak French?  Yes, I do.  Or Greek?  Yeah.  Do some of that dirty French for us.  Like, you know.  Like what?  Like, vous avez un peu de moi? 
[02:39:00]  That's it?  Ferme la bouche.  What was that?  What was that?  Oh, you know what it is.  Ferme la bouche.  That's how I want to sleep with you.  Or bed with you.  No, we want to, like, I want to suck your cocks.  Oh, come on.  I used to like that.  Then French.  No, no.  Then French.  No, I'm done.  No.  What are you?  Are you Josh?  I'm done.  I'm done.  Oh, that kid was good yesterday, wasn't he?  Ba-hoop, ba-hoop.  I can't talk.  Ba-hoop, ba-hoop, ba-hoop.  Fucking sorry.  I'm not mommy and daddy hugging you. 
[02:39:30]  Okay, so you wanted to say what?  She didn't want to say anything.  You pointed her out.  She didn't want to say anything.  Yeah, she does want to talk.  She did, though.  Say in Spanish?  Yeah, she kept fucking...  I can say in Spanish if you want.  Yeah, you won't swear in French, but you'll swear in Spanish?  Yeah, because I want to hear if you know any.  What?  Do you know Spanish?  He does.  Yeah.  Exactly.  My first language.  Louie, why don't you talk to her in Spanish?  I don't feel like it.  I don't need to prove that I'm Mexican. 
[02:40:00]  Just some fucking Puerto Rican from Connecticut.  I'm Puerto Rican.  Do you see how they infight?  That's why I don't know.  I understand.  No unity.  I want you to say something.  Why would I have unity from people from a fucking island?  I mean, there's no similarity to Mexicans in Puerto Rican.  No, I know.  A lot of people just lump them in the same category.  That's lazy.  It's lazy.  It's easy.  Jesus.  I thought we'd get more than that.  Thank you, Jim.  It was just so matter-of-fact. 
[02:40:30]  It didn't even sound like you were kidding.  It wasn't a joke.  It's just the way I think.  Are you going to talk dirty for us in Spanish?  Yeah.  What do you want me to say?  Whatever?  Oh, boy.  Jesus, Jim.  ¿Te quiero mamar el pene ahora?  What?  What?  I want to suck your cock now.  Whoa.  Better than what I would have come up with.  And then can you speak Spanish?  No.  I'm missing every fucking one. 
[02:41:00]  I was implying that she wanted to suck my cock and then speak Spanish.  Also, we said it during the break, but we should say it for the live show.  Pat Duffy's a celebrity today.  Yes.  Do you want to explain to the audience out there?  Oh, you're already explaining here, but to the people in their cars and trucks and shit.  Well, there's an article on MSNBC.com about people talking on their phone in their cars,  and they used a picture of me as the file photo. 
[02:41:30]  Were you on the phone in your car?  Yeah.  There was Douchebag on the phone in his car just looking.  I really do look very douchey in the picture.  The headline should have been, why is this Amish guy using a machine?  Look at you.  He's on the phone.  How did the picture get taken?  How did it happen?  I have no idea.  Really?  I have no recollection of what's going on.  Hey, Cameron.  I don't know. 
[02:42:00]  Fucking dumbies on the phone, but you see the back.  There's like a fucking dog leash and like a bloody ribbon in the fucking bumper.  He's whistling.  It's all tarped off.  A little patent leather shoe.  It's funny.  With a never again to be buckled buckle.  Wow, thanks, Kenny.  I asked Kenny for peanut butter and celery.  A dog?  A dog. 
[02:42:30]  Where's Kenny?  Did he leave?  Get Kenny to the party.  Hey, what happened, Jimmy?  You got a lot of celery there.  Yes.  Wow.  He stacked them up nice in need for me.  Kenny's very efficient.  I didn't have anywhere else to go with that.  I thought you were amazed by the pile of celery he gave you.  That's what I want.  That's a lot of celery.  Well, luckily, they wanted some celery improv.  They wanted some celery improv.  Canoe. 
[02:43:00]  Club soda, Kenny, everyone.  Once again, yes.  We're doing sitcom entrances once again on the show today.  All right.  Kenny, a lot of celery there.  Yeah, well, Jimmy might be hungry.  Well, that's it.  I got to be prepared.  To do what?  Stop the show and expect?  Do you want some, Kenny?  No, I like to make it nice.  That was a nice presentation.  That's too many.  That's too many. 
[02:43:30]  Maybe, Lou, maybe you wanted to taste one and share your fruit salad.  Uh, no.  That's too many celery.  I debated it, but, you know, I did it anyway.  Excuse me.  Hey, Jimmy, you think there's going to be an email later apologizing for the abundance of celery from Kenny?  I'm sorry if the pile of celery was visually unpleasant.  This is no joke, people.  Kenny will apologize later.  I don't want them to. 
[02:44:00]  Anybody want a piece of celery?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Okay.  Yeah.  Do we have any more?  No, that's it.  That's the entire celery bunch.  Would you buy me one piece?  No, it comes in a bunch, a stalk.  It's a bunch or a stalk.  What is it?  It's a bunch of a stalk.  I don't know.  And I cut it up like nice for Jimmy.  Oh, you cut that?  Man, I wash it. 
[02:44:30]  You went and bought his whole stalk of celery and then cut it into pieces for him?  Yeah.  They sell it like that, faggot.  That's what, like, a personal assistant does.  I know, and I'm sorry.  I'm not going to play assistant, though, but Kenny doesn't even wash the celery.  Of course he's your assistant.  He just spits on us.  All right, we got a question coming in from Stupid Canada.  Let's say hi to Eve.  Eve.  Yes?  What's up?  Wait, your name is Eve?  Yeah, you got a weird name there, kid. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, man.  It's the French version of, yeah.  In French, Eve means Eve.  Oh.  Yeah.  It's spelled in French.  Is it spelled like Y-E-V-E-S?  Yeah, Y-V-E-S.  Y-V-E-S.  Your name is Y-V-E-S.  It's not Eve.  Y-V.  Exactly.  That was Jacques Cousteau's middle name, right?  Was it?  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, what are you doing New Year's, Y-V-E-S?  See? 
[02:45:30]  It doesn't work.  All right, what do you got?  Yeah, I've got a question for your Puerto Rican back there.  All right.  For your Puerto Rican.  What the?  Or it's more of an order.  Sous-ma-cour-salut.  Ask her to translate that one.  Oh, wow.  Say it again, sir.  Suck my cock, whore.  Exactly.  What?  You got it?  Yeah.  Sous-ma-cour-salut.  He said, suck my cock, whore.  Yeah, it sounds...  I know a little French.  Just French Canadians are funny anyways. 
[02:46:00]  Oh!  No, you got me there, dude.  Face.  Face.  Got me there, dude.  Obviously, you're smarter than me.  Can you translate it for me then?  I'm sorry, come again?  Oh, God.  No, go ahead.  I don't know.  Sous-ma-cour-salut.  You don't know that one?  No, I don't.  Ou mange ma-cour, ou, uh...  Veux-tu un peu de sperme?  No?  Drinks my sperm?  What?  What?  Do you want cum? 
[02:46:30]  Oh.  No, I have a nice one right here, hon.  Do you want cum?  Oh.  Est-ce que tu le prends dans le cul aussi?  You take it in the ass?  Hey, how do you say fart box in, uh...  In French?  Uh, coque-cu.  Apple.  Yeah, coque-cu.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  Hey, you're a bit worked there, sir.  Okay, well, thanks a lot.  A long-time listener, you're great.  Continue on the good work. 
[02:47:00]  Thank you.  What a polite way to end.  Wait, how are you?  I'm Canadian.  But how are you a long-time listener if you're from Canada?  We haven't been up there that long.  Well, uh, XM, I've been listening for a couple years now, and, uh...  I mean, I'm on the road a lot, so, uh, you guys are always on.  I got it.  What's, uh, what's your favorite bit on the show?  Favorite bit.  Yeah!  I'm always embarrassed.  That was just, uh, too easy.  It was, uh, Seth.  It was like shooting croissants in a barrel. 
[02:47:30]  Seth.  That French thing.  We got to give them all the catchy things we do on the show.  They appreciate it.  Seth, Jersey, what's up?  Hello?  All right.  Seth?  Hello?  What's up?  Hi, Seth.  Just key your handsets on if you can't speak.  That's funny.  I love that part.  Zips and the wires.  There's a lovely fucking war, gentlemen. 
[02:48:00]  Seth?  Uh, Seth.  All right.  Seth.  Seth's, uh, having issues.  Rebuilding an engine.  Yeah.  Fucking his gas tank or something.  Brian, Georgia, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hi, Brian.  Hey, man.  Hey, uh, I just want to let, uh, Jimmy and Louie know I sent you down in Bonnaroo, and  you guys were really good.  Oh, thanks, man.  Thanks, man.  I'm, uh, I drive a bus for widespread panic, and I tried to get back to see you guys one  time, and all I kept running into was Brian Posner, and I couldn't, couldn't get away 
[02:48:30]  from it.  Why?  Oh, you, you, you, widespread panic.  Weren't they, uh, like the Sunday night headliners on the main stage?  Late, late, late Sunday night.  Like, closed it out.  Are you the regular bus driver?  Well, I drive one of the buses, yeah.  Oh, okay.  How are they?  Uh, the show?  Yeah.  Yeah, the show was awesome.  I don't know them.  They're, like, really popular.  Yeah.  Yeah, tonight we're playing in, in Morrison, at, uh, at Red Rocks.  Okay.  In Colorado.  Oh, yeah.  I heard about that game.  So, I just want to let you guys know you're really good, and, uh, I had a really great  time.  Thank you, man.  Thank you. 
[02:49:00]  All right, bro.  Thanks a lot, man.  It's funny.  All right.  We, um, we didn't finish talking to the audience.  Oh, Jimmy, you got some more questions for them?  I see that we got, uh, like, uh, like a New York Met and a New York Yankee right  in the front row there.  It looks like this is going to be a rival.  How are you guys even getting a rival?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Subway series going down today, huh?  Where are we going to the second game tonight at Shea?  Oh, I bet you one of you guys will be razzing the other one.  Oh, my God.  Are you guys friends?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, friends. 
[02:49:30]  How great would it be if this ended with one of them in cuffs, and the other one with  a fucking broken Michelobite on his neck?  Fucking friendship ruined, night of blackout drinking.  Uh, question for the Met fam, because we talked about it earlier.  Are you bummed that Shea Stadium's going away?  That shit hole?  Not really.  It's a real shit hole.  Of course not.  A real shit hole.  And what about you, sir?  But, uh, looking forward to Citi Field, though.  It looks pretty awesome.  Can't wait to drop $100 per ticket, you know? 
[02:50:00]  Per ticket?  Per ticket.  He's a little nervous, Jim.  I know it happens.  Are you happy that they're bringing the, uh, the baseball hat, the apple hat, where they  hit a home, make a home burn, and the apple comes out of the hat?  I'm going to be honest.  Yeah, I do.  I do want the, uh...  Why?  Why?  How about a big asshole and a fucking Willie Randlock in the floor?  That'll be fine, too, Jimmy.  That'll be fine.  Yeah.  I like Willie.  Wait, he's got a Willie Randolph joke.  Like Willie Randolph.  Hit a home run. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, the Yankees are doing the same thing.  After you hit a home run, Joe Torre's prostate crumbled.  You have to kick it to Los Angeles.  Well, there you go.  Long-time friends with a little rival.  Yeah, look at that.  That's crazy.  It's kind of heated.  Watch out.  And we have, I have to introduce one of my friends, even though she might be embarrassed.  Really?  Yeah, so we have to make sure we're nice to her.  Vinnie Brand's daughter.  So we have to be very...  What is that about?  Wait, are you kidding?  Yeah, she's a very beautiful girl over there. 
[02:51:00]  That's Vinnie Brand's daughter?  Yeah.  But I didn't want anybody to say anything ludicrous to her, so I had to point her out, because  I know us.  Or I know you.  I know her, but you guys might not.  That's Vinnie's daughter?  Yes.  Why would he let her come here today?  That's nice.  I don't think he knows I'm here.  Oh.  All right.  Well, aren't...  Oh, she looked like Vinnie's daughter.  How old's Vinnie's daughter?  I'm 19.  19.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Fuck.  What the fuck?  Fucking Christ.  Yeah.  Is that your boyfriend?  Jesus, dude.  I don't know.  That's my best friend, Mike. 
[02:51:30]  Mike?  Best friend.  That's the guy that's trying to have sex with you.  Best friend.  Best friend, Mike.  Mike?  Do you like...  Mike?  Do you like Daniela?  We've been friends for about three years now, yeah.  But I'm actually dating...  19, 18, 70, 60 years.  Wow.  Just like a real relationship already.  Nice best friend.  I'm actually dating her best friend.  That's how we met.  She hooked me up with her best friend.  Oh, so you're dating her friend?  Yes.  All right.  That could be legit.  How long have you been with her friend?  Oh, about over two years now. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, all right.  And where's her friend today?  She's probably sleeping.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  She, um...  She's really not too interested in the show.  I try to get her to listen, but she's probably still in bed now.  Ugh, she's awful.  Why doesn't she like the show?  She doesn't have XM, and she doesn't want to pay for it, so...  And she's not up early enough to listen on 92.3, so...  All right.  What time is it?  10, 10?  10, 10, she's still sleeping?  I was going to buy her an XM unit, actually.  Yeah.  Well, why don't you?  Wait till the merger, though. 
[02:52:30]  Is she sleeping late because you fucked the shit out of her last night?  Valid question, Mike.  I can't answer that now.  You can't answer that.  All right.  So, now, of course, we all know your father,  and I know your father for 15 years, maybe more.  It seems like 25 years, all right?  It really does.  It's just endless.  Boy.  Does he monitor everybody you date?  I don't think he meets everyone I date.  Oh.  Really?  Not really.  Jesus. 
[02:53:00]  He's really scary when you meet him.  I know.  He's scary, and I know him.  I saw Vinny bite somebody's finger one time.  Really?  Yeah.  It was many, many years ago when the stress factory first opened,  and Vinny, in fairness, was provoked.  The guy was drunk, like a drunk patron,  and Vinny was booting him,  and the guy was pointing in Vinny's face aggressively,  and I'm like, oh, you don't want to do that.  And Vinny just bit his finger and held it in his mouth.  And that man didn't point again for the rest of the night. 
[02:53:30]  So you're a sophomore in college?  Mm-hmm.  Cool.  What's your major going to be?  Um, communications.  What, do you want to get into the business now?  Um, I don't know why I picked communication.  It's easy.  And I don't know.  If you're, like, good with people,  communications is, like, a good major.  Just as long as it's easy.  Do you want to be an entertainer of some sort?  Mm-hmm.  What kind?  Um, any kind.  Any kind.  Hold on, excuse me.  No, no.  No Vinny's daughter's joke, sir.  Anyone else, please. 
[02:54:00]  You could spit on them, but I can't with her.  I know her for too many years.  You have to be very nice, sir.  What did you know when she was a little, little girl?  Yeah, I remember.  I met, uh, one of my first...  You knew her when she was a little girl.  You knew her when she was a little girl.  What do you do?  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  Smartass.  What?  Oh, I never met her?  What?  No, he's saying he doesn't know what...  You don't know what Ben Anthony's doing right now.  Right.  I don't either.  I need a third piece or two. 
[02:54:30]  No, I first...  Oh, perhaps, uh...  I first met her when she was...  No, it was, uh...  It was right after Kinison died, I think.  I went to her father.  Your mom's the one that told me that Sam died.  It's a whole story.  Okay.  Back in, what, 91, 92?  Did you watch Vinny Change Her Diaper back in the day?  No, I didn't.  It wasn't that close.  We were just doing gifts together.  We didn't open up to each other emotionally.  I would just pick up Vinny, and he would scream about shit all the way to the gig, and that  was the end of it.  That was it.  All right, so enjoy the show. 
[02:55:00]  Actually, I remember I met you when I was, like, 14, and I thought you were, like, really,  really dirty.  And I was just like, I don't even want to meet you for it.  And then after I met you, I thought you were the funniest person ever.  Oh, thank you.  And you taught me how to play chess.  What's that?  You taught me how to play chess.  Really?  That's nice.  Where do we play chess?  At the Salae.  Okay.  Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.  I forgot you came in.  I was, uh, but no, but I met you, like, when you were, like, literally, you were really  young.  You don't remember, obviously.  Yeah, she blocked it out. 
[02:55:30]  She'll remember in therapy.  Yeah.  No, that was, like, 90 years ago.  She'll remember under hypnosis.  That's funny that our father has a more feminine voice than she does.  Me?  Your father sounds like a midget.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  I'm aware I've heard before.  It's a little obscure, but he sounds exactly like Matt Roloff from Little People, Big World.  We did that bit too many times.  We don't need to do it again today.  Anybody else have anything out there? 
[02:56:00]  Wow, I just never knew that he had a good sperm.  Yeah.  Like, you gotta hand it to him.  You gotta hand it to him.  Excellent DNA.  What was, uh, you know, what's mom looking like, uh, you know?  Obviously, your mom's a supermodel.  Yeah.  She's very pretty.  I haven't seen her in years, but...  I haven't seen my mom in years.  She doesn't look anything like me, I mean, yeah.  No?  Wait, you haven't seen your mom in years?  No, but I look exactly like my stepmom.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's really shady, actually.  Nah, that's cool.  No, you could pretty much know... 
[02:56:30]  Fucked up family, that's good.  I like that.  Wait, she looks like your stepmom?  Yeah.  How did that happen?  Why do you have to be related to Vinny, man?  I know.  We got some questions to ask you.  She's a very lovely girl.  I know, can I ask this?  Why haven't you seen your mom in all these years?  Oh, um, the Stress Factory?  It's in New Brunswick.  It's like the best comedy club ever.  I'm sure you guys have all been there.  This is the beginning to why she didn't see her mom.  Wow, that is a good plug.  He was asking my favorite comedy club, right?  But how would one call it, yeah? 
[02:57:00]  She doesn't want to talk about her mom.  I understand.  She doesn't want to talk about her mom.  I figured I'd try, at least, you know?  Because we've got a lot of guys around here that hate their moms, so I'm just...  Do you know how you would relate?  Oh, do you know how stupid I am?  I really thought she was getting into the mom story.  I'm such a dumb motherfucker.  Why am I in a business where I have to communicate for a living?  I'm like, okay, but what about...  Asshole.  All right, we won't go there, obviously.  I hope you're having fun.  Yeah.  Would you like a piece of celery?  Yes, please.  Okay.  Yeah, of course.  This is getting weird now. 
[02:57:30]  No.  All right.  She skipped over.  Well, she knows me.  No, I can't.  You have to be nice to her.  She's my friend.  All right.  Huh?  She's fucking ridiculous.  I just got to be honest.  Someone here has got to be fucking honest.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Oh, very pretty. 
[02:58:00]  Yes.  Oh, look at Jim.  Oh, very pretty.  Yes, yes, yes.  If it was anybody else that you didn't know, you'd already have fucking 18 MySpace phone  numbers and everything being thrown at it by Canon.  We have MySpace.  We've MySpace each other.  We have friends on MySpace.  You've never seen more polite MySpace.  No shit.  Godspeed, dear.  Because I look at her, I see a pretty girl, but what I really see is a fist attached to  a club owner. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, you have stuff to lose.  I read your book, Happy Endings.  I thought it was fucking hilarious.  I read it in one day.  MySpace, and tell them how funny it is.  And then he writes me the most polite MySpace message back.  I'm like, how can I read Happy Endings and then get this message back?  It was actually embarrassing when you, like, you know, because when you know someone for  that many years and they read that, all those made-up stories.  Yes, all that's fake.  I don't think they're made-up at all.  No, they're really not.  There's actually worse stuff that I edited out.  Let me just try to enlighten you a little bit. 
[02:59:00]  He's trying to be sweet on MySpace.  He's trying to be, like, sweet.  Like, I'm not that guy.  There's an ulterior motive there.  It might take a couple of years.  We're being that guy.  It might take a couple of years.  It might take...  But, yeah.  No, there are very few...  I'm cock-blocking, by the way.  It's very sweet.  This is pure...  Just cock-blocking.  You can hire ten of Louie's relatives to build the wall if you want to. 
[02:59:30]  That's a block that's perfectly acceptable.  This is really sweet.  Yeah.  This is really sweet to see...  We must really like Vinny, because we're all dying to...  This is the most...  We're dying to say and do awful things.  I could give a shit about Vinny Brown.  I don't care.  I'm just...  I'm being honest.  That's all I said.  I'm only restraining myself for Jim's benefit, because he seems to...  You know, because he has a...  Fuck Jim Norton.  Yeah, I know.  He has an option.  He's putting this girl in a very sweet light with a little bow in her hair and a whole... 
[03:00:00]  You know, skipping down the road with a lollipop.  Yeah.  But she likes...  She likes the dirty Jim Norton.  Right.  No, it's very nice.  It's a sweet thing.  What was your favorite part of Jimmy's book?  Was there one story that stood out?  When he talked about his girlfriend, and he wrote her that letter that he thought was  like romantic for some reason, but it was basically saying how he wanted to kill her.  And then he was really surprised when she was upset.  Yeah, a pumpkin, a love story.  It's definitely my favorite part. 
[03:00:30]  That's funny.  All right.  This is a funny energy.  Yeah, it's...  Everybody's being so nice.  You have to be.  Very rarely.  We're pinched with everybody.  I know.  That's the thing about it.  It's like...  And Jim's being nice.  What do you want to say, Lo?  And what's hanging in the air is that everybody wants to fuck her tits and do a blue hat.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Wow, Lo.  I guess Lo doesn't need the Stress Factory. 
[03:01:00]  I'm doing a theater down the street from there tonight, so I'm probably hurting him.  Oh, that's the competition.  Yeah, fuck him.  I don't give a shit about the Stress Factory.  You're going to hear a grovely voicemail lobbing Molotov cocktails in the air.  Sorry.  It's the O.P. Anthony show.  What can I do?  Should we have her sit back down before it gets ugly?  Yeah, I feel like I'm ruining your show by making it cool.  Not at all.  Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce. 
[03:01:30]  Really nice girl.  Really nice girl.  Yes.  Very sweet.  Why don't we take a break and take care of these corners?  I wasn't sure if it would be a judgment error introducing her.  It was a really smart thing to do.  Because we were all going like, who the fuck is that?  Who the fuck is that sitting there?  And why is Jimmy picking out the Puerto Rican from Connecticut when she's sitting there?  When she's sitting there.  No, but what he's saying is...  Well, you know, you have to, you know. 
[03:02:00]  Ah, shit.  All right, we'll break and continue.  State Theater tonight.  New Brunswick, New Jersey.  If you want to see Louie and doing Unmasked.  I'm assuming a bunch of you guys are going Unmasked today.  Oh, good, okay.  Comics right here in New York.  14th and 9th Avenue at 1 o'clock with Louie C.K.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[03:02:30]  And a bunch of listeners just staring at us and hoping...  Danny just worked the crowd.  Danny, you want to grab a mic?  Danny was working the crowd and...  Is that my headphones?  We're trying to see if...  Louie's got Anthony's headphones on. 
[03:03:00]  There you go.  Louie's all right.  State Theater.  I have ear aids.  By the way, Louie, there was a little tension between you and Vinnie's daughter.  She kind of took a little shot at you during the commercial break.  What did you say again?  Let's hear that again.  Oh, I just said good luck at the show tonight.  I think he's a great comedian.  Oh, that's nice.  Thank you.  But you said you'd never seen him before.  Oh, yeah, no.  Actually, no, I've seen him at my club.  But I was just teasing him. 
[03:03:30]  I said he was plugging that he's working at the State Theater.  And I asked him if he's working at the concession stand.  That's right.  She gave Lou a good belt.  Right to his stupid red-headed balls.  That's right.  She's right.  She said my club.  You're right, actually, eventually.  She will.  Yeah, who knows?  Your dad retires.  I hope so.  You could do the phone bit on the wall.  That's right.  That's funny.  I want to buy the club, and then I want to just sit Vinnie down and pour gas on the phone 
[03:04:00]  and set it on fire in front of him and go, now what?  And then sell it back to him.  Danny, what do we got?  Well, we have a few different people with some interesting stories today.  We do have...  Where is he?  I can't see him.  I just hear a voice.  Oh.  Danny.  Me.  Oh, there you are.  I thought you were in the audience.  Oh, no.  I've been back there for a while now.  Lou thought it was magic.  Is this Danny in Danny? 
[03:04:30]  It's magical.  We do have one of Duffy's old high school teachers.  What?  And he says he has a story about Duffy.  We also have a man who, as a child, drank lighter fluid and took his grandfather's heart  medication.  And we also have a gentleman who, in Korea, threw up on a hooker.  You gotta go, Korea.  All right, that gentleman's name is Dan.  Wow.  Oh, boy, this guy.  I bet she threw up right back.  Thanks, Jim. 
[03:05:00]  Welcome aboard, Dan.  By the way, he has his ass right in front of the lovely...  Yes, please.  Please don't do that.  He has a long...  Dan's a big kid.  He's got...  He's kind of...  He looks a little balding.  He's got a big...  What kind of beard?  That's like a long...  That's just a mess.  A train wreck.  You look like that old wrestler.  Jim the Anvil Neyheart.  There you go.  Yeah, you've heard that a few times, huh?  Sam, look who's in studio today.  Yes.  You want to see my singlet? 
[03:05:30]  It's Tony.  Yeah.  It looks like Tony with...  Tony the intern with a long beard.  Absolutely.  Yeah, a little bit.  That was Danny's joke.  That's true.  All right.  Yeah, I was in Korea back in 95.  Doing what?  I was in the Army.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You don't look that old.  33.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know.  I don't know.  Whatever.  But, yeah.  The town right outside of Post, there's a bunch of bars on the main drag, and then there's  an alleyway, and there's a lady there called Ajima.  As you walk by, she's like, oh, you want a pretty lady? 
[03:06:00]  You want a pretty lady?  So it was my birthday, so I'd been drinking a little bit, maybe.  And so my friends decide to get me a short-time girl for the night.  Well, the short-time girl, it's just, you pay once, do your thing, and go.  I think it was like 40 bucks on-  Instead of spending a lovely evening?  Well, you could get long-time girls.  When I was there, a short-time girl, it was $40.  If it was a payday weekend, non-payday weekend, you could get them down to maybe like 20, 25.  What's a long-term girl?  Long-time girl's all night.  They're usually about 200 bucks. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  Tang Dushan Korea, in case you're interested.  Is that North Korea?  Well, it's the northern part of South Korea.  It's about, it's halfway between Seoul and the DMZ.  Did you do a lot of vacationing and traveling in the northern part?  I'm dying to go.  I actually, I did go up to the DMZ, but that was more of a tourist thing.  I'm not hardcore.  How big is it?  I know it's, what, we have 15,000 troops there or something, or 1,500 troops compared  to like 700,000 that the North Koreans have?  I don't know what the numbers are, but we're way outnumbered. 
[03:07:00]  And like at Camp Casey, where I was, like it was a kind of, my motor pool probably would  have been destroyed before I got out of bed if there was a war starting.  So the only thing that keeps the fucking North Koreans from deep dicking the South is that  little, is that fucking demilitarized zone because they're afraid of starting a war with  the U.S.  Yeah, what'll happen is if they start the war, all the roads there, south of Seoul, they  have like, roads like interstates, but north of Seoul, it's like you'll be going through  a mountain, there'll be like two lanes will go down to one lane, like for both directions,  and there'll be big boulders on top.  So if the war starts, they set off charges to drop the boulders to block off all roads. 
[03:07:30]  So in charge of the army, the coyote?  Fucking Kim Jong-il gets out of a Bosworth Acme dickhead.  Wow.  Well, yeah, basically the, well, I mean, this is like 10 years ago, but from when I was  there, it felt like the troops that were there were just more of like a speed bump just to 
[03:08:00]  slow the north down long enough until we could get troops resupplied.  It was, you know, it wasn't.  Good luck to you, yeah.  Yeah, it was fun at Christmas time when an American helicopter got shot down over North Korea.  We had a, they called us out for like a Saturday.  We had a long weekend and everyone's in the barracks, a stinking drunk.  They come through like, formation, come as you are.  So we all go out like in our shower shoes, carrying beers.  Like, oh, a helicopter just got shot down on the other side of the DMZ.  So you might want to stop drinking.  So when you puked on the hooker, what happened? 
[03:08:30]  They started asking tactical stuff.  Why did the fucking thing get shot down?  The guy got lost.  Oh.  And they shot him down?  They don't play, right?  Yeah.  So short time, what did the girl say to you again when she was walking?  Well, it's Ajimant.  Ajimant's like the old lady would be like, you know.  So what did she say?  She's like, oh, you walk by.  She's like, oh, you want pretty lady?  You want pretty lady?  And you know, by the way, she probably knows how to say, would you like a pretty lady?  But she's like, they like it when you drop the A.  It's all fucking fake.  You like pretty lady?  And then she's like, this fellow wants a pretty lady. 
[03:09:00]  Let's get him one.  But she fucking knows he gets turned on by her illiterate, stupid fucking Korean-ness.  Go ahead.  So then they just, they take you down in the alley and they got these little like, I mean,  it's like maybe like, it's just like an alley and there's these doors and you go into each,  you go into the room and it's like each one is probably about maybe a little bit bigger than  like a garden shed.  And there's just like a mattress on the floor.  Awesome.  So you go in and yeah, so I, you know, you can take your clothes off and you just start 
[03:09:30]  going and I was just.  Basically stick your dick in a Petri dish.  Exactly.  Hey, you know, my barracks is right next to the medical clinic, so I wasn't too concerned.  Sure.  But yeah.  Did you get anything?  No, no.  So.  It's been 10 years.  I think I'd know by now.  No, you wouldn't.  Korean AIDS is sneaky.  You get it and then it mails itself to you.  So, all right.  So you want to have AIDS?  I want to have AIDS?  You like an HIV? 
[03:10:00]  She was, she was on, she was on top of me and I was just kind of like laying there and  I wasn't feeling too good.  So I, then I like, I kind of like got on top.  I was weighed a lot less then, so, but I was just kind of doing my thing, sort of, and  it was, and then all of a sudden I just, ever see like when a dog, just before it throws  up, it starts like, yeah, like that's kind of what I was doing and all of a sudden it  just let loose and basically like I had a nice spray pattern from like the top of the  head down to like the belly. 
[03:10:30]  Was she panicking when you started retching?  Um, yeah, as she started screaming, um, and the area where we were, they, um, they had  MPs patrolling the area, so she got up and she was screaming for the MPs, so I just like  threw my pants on, put on my boots and grabbed my jacket and ran out of there.  And what made you throw up?  I was hammered.  I, I, I've been, it was my birthday, so I've been drinking basically all day.  What a nice birthday.  Yeah.  It was memorable.  Puking on a Korean hooker in a garden shed. 
[03:11:00]  You'll never forget that one.  You say it sarcastically, but God damn it.  Yeah, I know.  What a gift I would be to give myself.  Awesome.  Wow.  She has, she has your American dick in her and vomit.  She's looking at a rake off to the left.  That's great.  All right.  Good story, man.  Good boy.  You're a good boy.  Thank you for your service to your country.  Where's, where's the teacher that has a Pat Duffy story? 
[03:11:30]  That'd be me.  You're, what?  You're young.  You'd look way too young to be teaching Pat Duffy.  You look his age.  I'm 35.  Wow.  Yeah, well, that's young to be a teacher of that fellow.  How old were you when you taught Pat?  You graduated, what, four years ago?  Five.  Five years ago, yes.  From what?  I had him.  High school?  High school.  All through high school, yeah.  So you were his gym instructor?  I taught TV and video production.  I still do.  Why did I think you, I'm sorry, I thought you were, oh, all right.  I'm very physically fit. 
[03:12:00]  Awesome.  Who doesn't know that?  So what happened?  He taught something about transvestites.  He showed up at my house one night.  He showed up at my house one night.  It was his senior year and he showed up at my house.  I live about 30, 35 minutes away from the school, so he and a buddy had showed up at my house.  It's like a Friday night, like eight, nine o'clock at night.  I still, to this day, have no idea why he came to the door. 
[03:12:30]  To film you through your window.  Is that what it was?  Yes.  And then to show you later on in school, he'd be like, hey, look, we went to your house.  But you caught us.  What are you, a fucking David Lynch movie?  Creepy as that.  It was for a project.  And we wanted to film him behind his back and then show it in class and be like, hey,  we were at your house.  What was the project?  Oh, it was up to anybody.  We were making, we were up to your discretion.  How to quietly shoot somebody from the shrubs.  That's what it was.  It was like, we were doing dream sequences and one of my partner's dreams was to kill him.  So we went to his house. 
[03:13:00]  What?  I probably got an A on it.  A better dream than a masturbatory fantasy.  That's what it turns into.  I told the guys to leave.  We wouldn't.  How did you know they were there?  Did you guys, you guys ring the doorbell or did I see you out there?  No, we saw your parents.  Yeah.  I had some people over.  Some people, your parents.  Wait, you were a teacher living with your parents?  No, no, no.  I was at my apartment.  I had my parents.  My brother was in town.  So we were hanging out, having a couple of beers.  And so basically the parents were there and you're like, hi, we're, we're, we're students. 
[03:13:30]  We actually ran out of the alley with a camera and we were like, are you related to Mr. Brant?  And he was like, oh, I'm his dad.  So then we started screaming, Daddy Brant's in town.  And we were just, we were yelling at him.  They, yeah, they, they followed him.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  He was going to get pizza and we followed him all the way down the block.  They were just here to film your son because he dreamt that he killed him.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  Carry on.  Have fun.  You and your big calves.  Oh, they're awesome.  You're jealous.  You're jealous. 
[03:14:00]  No, Jimmy's got good calves.  Believe me, they call me the fucking calf kid.  So it was a few years ago.  He, he actually came back to school.  Is, is he ever talked about being a pathological liar?  Oh, what the fuck?  Oh, now we're getting some.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  No, let's get to the bottom of this.  Oh, all right.  Long story short.  I went to, uh, I went to the high school and I was like, Mr. Brant.  Bullshit.  Sorry.  No, I, I just made, I used to make up all kinds of stuff all the time.  Like, I would never, ever tell the truth. 
[03:14:30]  Really, never.  I just didn't.  Let me ask you as a pathological liar, when you're telling one of those lies, and this  is true, what are you thinking as you're telling it?  You believe the lie.  You do?  Yeah, absolutely.  Okay, you're just saying it like it was, like, like you're describing a movie, but  it's really your life and you kind of mean it.  Okay.  Do you really believe it?  I used, I used to.  I used to do it all the time.  Oh, fuck.  I, I, I pulled that shit until I got arrested and charged with something that I hadn't done and  I had to go before a judge and explain that I had fucking made  something up.  What was it, Jimmy?  I lied.  Just now. 
[03:15:00]  Pat the liar.  What was one of these lies, Pat?  Everything.  Anything and everything.  Like, what?  Give us one.  Or does the teacher have one?  You gotta remember one.  At that, at that time he, he, he told me that he had previously gotten a computer, which  he did.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I told him that, because he's a video teacher and we were talking about video stuff and I  was like, oh, yeah, I got the new Apple MacBook Pro.  It's awesome.  I got OS 10.2 and all this other stuff. 
[03:15:30]  I didn't have it at all.  What a dick.  Yeah, I know.  No, but the worst part is he goes, oh, if I knew you had all that stuff, I would have  just given you one of the old ones.  One of the old computers.  So I just fucked myself out of it.  You see when you lie what happens?  Pat came back and he fessed up and I ended up giving one of the old computers.  Thank you.  Pat, what's your deal?  Were you touch funny as a kid?  Where does all this come from?  No, I'm just really angry all the time.  Why are you angry?  I don't know.  Where does this come from?  His dad liked to shave while he was in the tub. 
[03:16:00]  Where's Patty?  Is she here yet?  Jimmy hasn't heard this story yet.  I have not.  Sturker Patty should be here any moment.  Yes.  They're walking her.  So, wait a minute.  He would lie a lot.  What was the lie you caught him in?  Well, he came back and fessed up on the computer.  I didn't know he was a lie.  He tells me he was a pathological liar.  I don't know whether to believe him or not.  Yeah, but the computer story, no offense, is kind of whatever.  We need a good one.  Like, were you ever late and they said, what were you doing?  And you decided to rescue Lois Lane?  Yeah.  I mean, I never really got caught in a lie with him or anybody in school. 
[03:16:30]  It's just like, my whole life.  What was the best lie you ever told?  I don't know.  Worst one you ever got caught in?  Worst one you ever...  I'm trying.  I'm trying.  I don't know off the top of my head.  Just give me a second.  How about just one that you told that you're like, why did I just say that?  I don't know.  My dad's listening right now.  He's probably got a million that he could tell, but...  I haven't...  We try to ignore him when he calls the show, to be honest with you.  I try to ignore him in life, as well.  I can't tell you how many times he's been on the phone and we just don't go to his...  Good.  Don't ever. 
[03:17:00]  He sucks balls.  Come on.  One lie.  I have nothing.  I'm terrible.  Come on.  You remember one.  Something you told a girl to impress her.  Oh, my penis is huge.  She's going to find that out, though.  What is a stupid lie?  Yeah.  He's out of here to buy a much smaller home.  Or if you're a really good liar and you're showing it to her.  All right.  I'm just making a relative comparison joke.  Like, look, his cock is half the size of the couch.  I'm sometimes a little titter with an explanation. 
[03:17:30]  All right.  So, come on.  What was what you told me?  Yes.  All right.  Oh.  Patty's here?  Oh, it's Patty.  All right.  Stalker Patty, come to the front of the class.  Hey, Stalker asked for it.  Get in here.  Stalker cock tease.  Come on, now.  Ladies and gentlemen, Stalker Patty.  There you go, Patty.  Here she comes.  Oh, she's wearing shorts, for fuck's sake.  Patty.  Patty.  Wow.  You're a little knock-kneed, Patty.  You're a little knock-kneed. 
[03:18:00]  Hi.  Hi.  I just got off work 20 minutes ago and ran here.  That's true.  All right, Patty.  What are you doing?  Are you a model for Sloan Kettering?  Oh, shit.  I don't understand that.  That's a good one, Jimmy.  What's Sloan Kettering?  I don't remember what that is.  Thank you.  It's a cancer place, baby.  Here's our hospital.  I love you, too.  To really, you know, nail the job.  Oh, Patty.  She looks like she's dying.  Mr. Patty's improv. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She's got an ashen face of death.  Ladies and gentlemen.  And it's funny.  Out there in radio land.  Jimmy, talk to Lily for a second.  Just babble about it.  The thing is that we have to...  But babble away from the mic so that he can...  The beauty of Patty is listening to her improv skills.  Patty?  Yes.  Sorry I said that.  Yeah.  Jimmy, go.  You can rip me back.  I didn't mean to tease you.  Yeah, give him a rip back.  Nice socks.  I'm not good at things off the top of my head, but I'll think of something later on. 
[03:19:00]  Hey, Patty.  That's usually how it happens.  Patty, here's the deal.  Last week you admitted when Jimmy was gone, or was that earlier this week?  I don't know.  We just tried to talk.  That you had some weird things happen to you when you were in your foster home.  Tell the bathtub story to Jimmy.  Yeah, when I was 14, 15, 16 years old, developed a teenager. 
[03:19:30]  When I was 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 38.  She's like an auctioneer.  He molested that spot.  What the fuck?  My foster father would just walk in nonchalantly and start doing things like shaving and stuff  While you were in the tub?  While I was in the tub.  At a very advanced age of puberty.  Was he shaving his face? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  And he would say what to you, Patty?  Tell Jimmy.  I would say, please, I don't want you in here while I'm here.  He would say, you're just a child.  I diapered your Heiner when you were little.  Your Heiner?  But it doesn't make a difference anymore now.  I'm 16.  I'm not 16 months.  Yeah, but what you got to understand  Is that when you put diapers on, you get attached to it. 
[03:20:30]  You want to see how much bigger it gets?  God damn it.  So, this would go on.  And also, you told us that when you went to your aunt's house,  You had to sleep with your dad on the couch.  Yeah, they would make me sleep on the couch with him when I wanted to be by myself or have my own area.  But they didn't believe in that.  Again, I was just a little girl and that was it.  Wait, Patty, who would you go with?  Your mom?  Your step-mom?  Your step-dad?  Your foster mom?  My foster father. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, Jesus.  My brother had to sleep with her.  God damn it, this woman's voice.  Why would your brother...  Oh, I know, right?  The thing that's serious is Patty's curse is that you can't have sympathy because of the voice.  You just can't.  Yeah.  I mean, even if she'd reported it, if she went to the police,  I'm being molested.  They'd be like, shut up!  Shut up!  Get out of here!  He's right.  Mail us the complaint.  Don't make us hear this shit.  Yeah, children were seen and not heard.  Yes, that's what I meant.  Thank God.  I bet the first time he shoved his dick in your mouth just to shut you up. 
[03:21:30]  It started out for logistic purposes.  He would have used a gassy rag, but he had his dick.  So it was the best he could do.  So, Patty, how old were you when this was happening?  Fifteen.  Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.  Teenager.  Teenager.  Teenager.  All right, and how old was your brother?  He was eleven months younger than me.  All right, so why round it off to a year?  Critical difference. 
[03:22:00]  How many hours, Patty?  Even hours!  Why round it off?  You'd get the wrong impression if she said a year.  That's true.  She needed more syllables.  So wait, he would sleep with your mother?  Yes, he would.  Why not have your mom and you and the brother?  I don't get it.  I don't know why.  I guess, see, you would think that, because that would be more normal.  That would be non-rapey.  So I didn't know what they were thinking.  I had no idea what they were thinking. 
[03:22:30]  Boy, they really fouled that up.  That was silly of them.  So wait, you and your dad on the couch.  Now, was it a sofa bed, or was it just a sofa with cushions?  It was just a regular couch, really big enough for one adult, but a child that could squeeze  in there.  I'm sure.  And I'm sure he did, too.  It wasn't very comfortable, and I didn't feel comfortable.  Of course not.  So what happened, Patty?  How would you sleep?  What position?  He would be on his side, and you would be, would you be face to feet, or how would you  be?  I would be on the side facing away. 
[03:23:00]  Sure, yeah, thinking of cotton candy and face.  And he also stunk, too, because he smoked a lot of cigars, and that made him stink.  So his breast stunk?  I could take it, yeah.  Were you face to face?  No, facing away.  No, I was away.  He was spooning her.  How was he facing?  Right?  I don't know what was going on while I was sleeping.  I had no idea.  Oh, goodness gracious.  You do know.  Now, you're facing away.  Yeah.  He's behind you. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  Now, is he facing away from you, or is he facing the same direction you are?  He was facing, he was on his back, mostly, and he was a snorer, and his arm, his left  arm would be under his head.  That was to cover up the crying.  So, um, when did he first kind of...  Shut up.  Stop.  Shut up.  When did he first...  I'm sure at times he would roll over and face the same direction you did.  If he did, I wouldn't know it, because I was asleep. 
[03:24:00]  I'm sure you wouldn't have felt anything, but...  Probably not.  Probably not.  But you must have remembered a couple times where you could feel that cigar breath on  the side of your face.  And the cigar, too, by the way.  And smoke.  Yeah, yeah.  All I know is that when he put his arm across my shoulder or my stomach, I would want to pull  away.  Oh, I used to do that.  I could understand.  I hated that.  He would put his arm across your stomach?  He would do that, yeah.  He would hold you?  I was like, oh my God, I would try to go like this to get his hand off my stomach.  And what would you feel now?  Oh, Jesus.  Because I didn't like that kind of handling. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, of course not.  I wasn't a hugger or going around, you know, whatever.  I hate the huggers.  Yeah.  I'm not a hugger.  You know, my friend, my friend, my friend loves him.  I'm like, you dumb hugger lover, get out of here.  My sister brought a hugger home one time.  Oh, forget about it.  Oh, man.  God.  Fucking gold tooth hugger.  So, Patty, hold on.  You would feel him.  Now, when he put his arm across your shoulders. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, I would.  You would feel, obviously you would feel it on the front of your chest.  How long would it be there for?  I don't know.  All I know is that I was used to going to sleep early, so I would just fall asleep almost instantly.  And what would wake you up sometimes?  What would wake you up?  His snoring.  Other things.  Or maybe if he put his hand too close to my side or something, I would snore.  He was fondling like a mad man.  When he would touch your stomach, you'd probably feel him pull back a little bit.  Like, did you think he was trying to keep him from falling off the couch? 
[03:25:30]  Maybe.  I don't know.  I was considerate.  But, you know, I wasn't sure.  But you felt him pressing up against you from behind.  Right, yeah.  And I felt that that was a little invasive.  Did you feel him pressing up against you from behind?  Like, you felt his erection.  You didn't like it.  I don't remember his erection.  I didn't, you know.  What were you wearing to bed?  Just my pajamas.  What were they?  My little flannels.  Pajamas.  Pajamas.  You know, just flannels.  Yeah.  Jesus.  With the fucking little round trap door on the back. 
[03:26:00]  They would have cute little hearts on them and stuff like that.  With the fucking glory hole pajamas in the back.  She said they'd have cute little hearts on.  So would he.  Did he ever slide your little pajama?  When he touched your stomach, would he ever put his hand up his shirt a little bit more  than you liked?  He didn't put his hand under my clothes.  No.  I don't remember him ever doing that.  I don't remember.  Yeah.  Was he ever naked in front of you?  What?  Was he ever naked in front of you?  While shaving or something?  Yeah. 
[03:26:30]  Well, you know, they had this habit keeping the bathroom door open.  So I would walk in by accident and not know he was in there and then see him going to  the bathroom and I would run out.  You know.  What would he say to you?  Big, beautiful cock.  Nothing.  Wouldn't say anything.  No, I'd just walk in and run out.  That's inappropriate.  You should keep the door closed at all times.  Well, easy with those tough stances.  This kid takes social risks.  Jimmy, I asked.  No shitting in front of the children.  Oh, bumper sticker.  Jimmy, I asked Patty to take a few days to come up with some more stories. 
[03:27:00]  Do you have any that you remember?  Yeah, I have a few that I do remember.  Something that they never told me that I know happened and had to have happened.  But I have a memory when I was three of a nasty, awful leg injury.  I don't know where it came from.  I remember being held a lot and carried because I couldn't walk on the leg.  And to this day, nobody will tell me.  But I have a scar right there.  And nobody told me where it came from. 
[03:27:30]  And I tried to ask him many times and I never got an answer.  Did you get caught in a trap?  I have no idea.  It was maybe about two or three when it happened, so I don't remember it.  But I know something happened.  Okay, so she's got casual memories of being molested.  Yeah.  That repressed memory of hurting her fucking leg.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I didn't understand.  That's just dug in deep.  It might be a shame.  Oh, by the way, the fellow pressed his fucking ticket in my ass tonight.  What else, Patty? 
[03:28:00]  Oh, I remember, oh, God.  Oh, my mother.  My natural mother had a mental illness and she was hospitalized.  That's why she had to give me up, you know?  She left you at a diner.  Yeah, she did.  But she got hospitalized before she left.  She'd leave you with some cherry pie at least.  She couldn't take it anymore, I guess, with a baby.  So she put me in a basket and dressed me up to the nines.  To the nines.  You know, like, really put clothes on me and put me on the one counter of the downtowner's restaurant. 
[03:28:30]  What goes well with a basket that she dressed you to the nines?  You're a fucking infant in a basket.  If you were wearing a drab outfit, people would have been like, yeah, I'll leave her in the basket.  They said I had on a pink dress.  She's socks, black and white, a beautiful pink and white blanket.  Wait, but what was the diner?  Downtowner's restaurant.  Where?  Downtown at One Trinity Place.  It's not there anymore. 
[03:29:00]  I went back to look for it.  Of course not.  Who would eat there after that?  Yeah.  Someone left shit on the counter.  Which is another thing, too.  I've been trying to find out.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God fucking damn it in the ass.  I've been trying to find out the circumstances with that, and I'm trying to look for a police  report on it.  Yeah, let alone walk everything.  We want more stories about your dad.  There's no police report. 
[03:29:30]  Check the ASPCA.  We want more dad stories.  We want the dad stories there, Patty.  Oh, when I went to the high school dance, he had to come with me.  He would make me wait outside the dance hall, or the church hall where it was.  He went in, looked around, cased and questioned people, embarrassing the hell out of me.  What would he ask them?  I don't know.  He made me stand outside, and if I came in, he would almost slap me across the face. 
[03:30:00]  What did he ask them?  What would he ask them?  I wish I knew.  I don't know.  Was he preparing them for your entrance, like saying, will you be bothered?  Please.  No, probably.  Please don't.  Probably what time is this going to be over?  He said, please don't dump pig's blood on her head.  Please, not like last year.  Four years in a row, you've dumped pig's blood on her head.  Exactly.  And you find another way to have your fun.  Don't stare at her mandibles.  What time, how late are you going to go, and this and that, what kind of music's playing, 
[03:30:30]  and all that.  And then he would allow me to come in.  At that point, I would practically run away to get lost in the crowd, so I could just get  away from him.  Right.  And I didn't see any other fathers there checking anything out, so I didn't understand what  that was about.  You were creeped out by this guy.  Yeah, I was.  I was.  He was a little bit too possessive.  You know, one time he was going to go shopping, you know, and with my foster mother, and I 
[03:31:00]  had a horrific argument with him.  I was 17 years old, and he yelled and screamed at me that I had to go, but I wanted to go  to my friend's house, which is more normal.  We were doing a science project together, and I wanted to go there.  Let's not gloss over that.  That is.  But anyway.  Hold on, Patty.  Your friend.  What were you, what was the science project?  Yeah.  I don't remember.  Something about animals or something.  We had to go to a museum and write about dinosaurs or something.  I don't remember. 
[03:31:30]  But the thing is, we got a phone call in the middle of the argument, and it was the mini  skirt at the time, so they were asking for my opinion.  He grabbed the phone here and says, there is nobody here but a man and a little girl,  and he banged the phone down.  Yeah.  At that point, I had.  I don't know what she's talking about.  I ran out of the place crying.  I ran to my friend's house.  I refused to come home for hours.  Just the sound.  It was just like a bird making a noise in a tree.  And he didn't come over looking for me either, which was surprising. 
[03:32:00]  No idea.  So, Patty, did you want to answer the mini skirt question?  What?  Did you want to answer the mini skirt question?  The mini skirt?  Yeah, I did.  What did you want to say about it?  I preferred the mini.  Obviously.  I don't know.  The mini or the midi?  The mini.  You liked the mini skirt.  Yes, I did.  You little fucking whore.  That's nice.  In fact, when I saw the movie Hair when I was older that came out in 79, I remember envying 
[03:32:30]  those kids that were flower children.  Going to Vietnam and being killed?  No.  Being on the hill and holding up anti-war signs and flower children.  I wanted to be them.  Maybe because I wanted to be free.  Why?  Maybe you did want to be free.  Free from the sexual abuse.  Let's go to Anthony in Virginia.  He's got an idea for you, Patty.  Anthony, what's up?  Yeah, does Patty even know, once she was getting her thermometer checked, can we get  a doctor in there to see if she has her hymen intact? 
[03:33:00]  Because I think she probably thought she was getting her temperature or something, and her  father was just reaming her.  All right, that's a very good point.  Some guy with the worst voice I've ever heard said that perhaps we should get you checked  to see if you have your hymen.  Do you still have your hymen?  Every time I go to a gynecologist, they can't complete the exam because they say I'm too  tight, and it's very painful.  If I do go to one, I want to be put out.  That's the only way they can examine it is to put me out, because there's no way I can 
[03:33:30]  stay conscious of that.  Everybody in your life is lying to you.  Do you understand that?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Patty, I'm going to have to put you out because you're just too tight.  That's the only way they can put you out.  You may wake up feeling a little strange.  Usually when a girl talks about how tight her pussy is, you get a lot of, oh, wow.  That's the only pussy you don't want to be tight.  That is not hot.  Only that was that they told me that if I ever had sex or, you know.  Her pussy is like a fetus's ear.  No. 
[03:34:00]  Not really.  No.  No.  I don't have anything like that.  Oh, I thought Jimmy was being serious.  I'm sorry, Patty.  Patty, do you still get your period?  Not anymore.  It stopped when I hit 50.  Of course it did.  Yeah.  You hit 50 like a fucking freight train.  And before that, did you use a tampon or a pad?  I preferred a tampon.  It was easier.  Why?  And was it a problem putting it in?  Why easier to throw it away?  No, I had no problem putting it in.  I had a nurse show me how when I was at college. 
[03:34:30]  The other girls would throw them at it going, plug it up, plug it up, plug it up.  Plug it up.  What is these for?  Scary carry, scary carry.  Hold on.  In college, what did you do for the seven years prior to that?  Oh, wow.  Good one.  What, was everybody missing socks around the house?  No, they made me wear the old-fashioned Kotex, whatever.  People found her like a shot deer. 
[03:35:00]  With the handles on the face.  Strailed her.  And then they wanted me to wear a belt, too.  Sharks were actually walking on land to follow her.  Hold on, hold on.  You missed that.  Patty said that she had to wear a belt.  Yeah, my foster mother made me put on a belt for it.  What's the belt for it?  The old-  Hold up the fucking rag that keeps the cunt blood from dropping in the floor.  That is real old school.  How would it go on? 
[03:35:30]  It was only 14 years old.  Patty, how would it go on?  How would the belt go on?  You know, just like underneath me, and then you'd buckle it, and it would stay on.  Is it like a sumo wrestler's thing?  It looks like that.  Yeah, yeah, like the pad, the Kotex, would clip onto the belt, right?  Yeah.  Front and back.  Yeah.  So you're wearing like a diaper.  Jesus Christ.  And a belt.  Then you could just fucking bleed like a Civil War veteran.  Fucking turn it around your cunt lips. 
[03:36:00]  Hold your patty off.  Your mic isn't working, Patty.  Your mic's not working.  Don't waste that.  It's the act of God.  Yeah, God doesn't want to hear either.  Go ahead, Patty.  Yeah.  So you put that-  So from the time you first got your period, when?  I was-  From 14.  At 14 years old.  Yeah.  And what was the first one like?  Did you have to talk to your foster mother, or what did you do?  Yeah, you know what? 
[03:36:30]  Exactly three weeks before I got it the first time.  Then she takes me aside and says, you're going to be sick next month, or the month after.  You're going to-  This is going to happen.  You know, like-  And what'd she say?  Something about being sick and getting pains.  And I'm like, but what's that about?  And then you're going to bleed.  What?  But she wouldn't explain anything about it.  She wouldn't tell you where you were going to bleed from?  Patty's got cotton in every fucking hole in her body.  I don't know what she's talking about, because, you know, that's something you discuss with  your daughter when she's not. 
[03:37:00]  How did she tell you?  Did she say, uh, that thing between your legs?  Did you see LaMotta after the Ray Robinson fight?  No, she just pulled me out into the room and just stood me there and told me.  She didn't tell you that your vagina would be bleeding?  No.  She wouldn't mention it.  She just said, you're going to bleed and get cramps and you're going to be sick.  Yeah, that's all she explained it.  That's nice.  And sure enough, I had the worst awful cramps the first three years that I had it, to  the point where she would make a hot toddy, which was hot milk and brandy sweetened with 
[03:37:30]  about 10 sugars and then make me drink it and it would put me out.  And delivered via cigar mouth.  Yeah.  A hot toddy.  Your daddy would just put it in his mouth and go, right off to the problem area.  I was too scared to mention it because they made me think the Lord was going to strike  me dead and stuff like that.  They put such a doom and gloom over it.  Were they religious people? 
[03:38:00]  They were very Catholic.  How long did you live with these fucking shit piles?  Since I was 16 months old until 19 when I was happy to go to college and I preferred  I preferred to stay on campus.  How old were you when they fucking mercifully died?  When I was 20.  She was 69.  And then he died about 15 years later.  Did you have a relationship with him at the end?  No.  I didn't even go home.  You hated him, right?  I couldn't stand him.  Why?  Oh, because he fucked her. 
[03:38:30]  I don't know that he went all the way.  Did he ever put...  Tell me what...  I know you remember.  When did he take your hand and put it on his penis?  I don't remember him ever doing that.  Don't remember.  No.  He didn't go that far at all.  Where'd he go?  Did he put it on your breasts?  Did he touch your breasts a little bit?  No, just like, I guess, side glances while I was in the tub and stuff.  That's basically it.  Just looking, you mean?  Yeah.  What a ghoul.  Yeah.  Louie's got to go jerk off after this. 
[03:39:00]  That's fucking...  There he goes.  Her panties look like they're fucking great outside of Abigail Folger's house.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  We're getting Patty a hypnotist.  That's great.  We're going to put you under, Patty.  We're going to find some shit out for you.  So she didn't say where you'd be bleeding from.  So when you started bleeding, what did you do?  Mommy, look what's in my pants. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, my God.  You know, I got scared.  She said, call the Opie and Anthony show.  You know.  Looked like Reginald Denny's head.  And then she gave me a quote and said, here, put that one.  Put it on?  She didn't tell you how or anything?  She wore like a hat.  Put it on.  Put fucking daisy on it.  She showed me where it was the pins.  Looked like Laura Ingalls' bonnet.  Yeah, at that time, you had all the pins.  Had ketchup on it.  Why is the retarded girl wearing a Japanese flag on her head?  Holy shit. 
[03:40:00]  Fucking Patty.  Wow.  So you had no clue why you were bleeding.  And she just gave you a code text.  She didn't explain to you further.  No, but when I went to the library to take a book out on it, now I had a younger brother  at the time, and he was just as messed up as they were. 
[03:40:30]  He would take the book and show it to them, and they would end up punishing me, and they  would hide the book.  So what book is it?  What book?  It was a medical book on getting a period, becoming a woman.  It was a normal book.  It was from the library.  They fucked her up.  And they would not allow me to read those things.  They wouldn't let you read it.  I had to do it on the sneak to learn math.  On the sneak.  On the sneak.  Just to learn about it.  That's what your dad was doing.  I had no other way of learning it.  So what, your brother now, wait, what happened to your brother?  I don't know whatever happened to him, but I hated him too, because he would punch me 
[03:41:00]  and give me bruises on my arm.  I would show it to my foster parents, and if I hit him back, I got hit by them.  He wasn't your biological brother then?  He was my biological brother.  Oh, he was?  So you don't know who he was.  He had special problems.  Oh, yeah.  What was wrong with this?  Yeah, he was born with my mother's schizophrenia, which is why he saw shadows on the wall coming  to life that I couldn't see, and he kept them up.  That was daddy.  She could be the most fucked up individual. 
[03:41:30]  No kidding.  So wait, your mother had schizophrenia.  Yeah, my natural mother.  Yeah, yeah.  And your natural, so your mom gave up you and your brother to the same people?  Yeah, to the same people.  And how many years since you've seen your brother?  Right now, it's been about 14, 15 years.  I kind of fear him because of his illness.  You know, he used to be very violent when he was younger.  He would hit me.  I'd have bruises from him as a child.  I know you said that.  Where's he now?  He's holding the mic right there.  It's Pat Duffy.  This violent motherfucker. 
[03:42:00]  I was just thinking I had very similar problems.  Yeah.  Where is he now, Pat?  Living somewhere in the city or Staten Island or Brooklyn.  I don't know which one.  Oh, that's good.  The last address was on Staten Island.  Staten Island, Brooklyn.  Why don't you just say Queens also?  Yeah, you forgot the name.  He could be anywhere.  Do you have any family at all that you are with?  That you know?  Nobody.  Nobody?  No.  Ah, you ain't got nobody.  No.  Do you have any friends or anything?  Who do you spend most of your time with?  Who do you talk to every day?  Is there anybody that you talk to every day?  People at work. 
[03:42:30]  People at work.  One or two people in the building, like my neighbor across the hall.  So nobody that actually wants to talk to.  Nobody that invites you.  Just people that you talk to because they're near you.  The question would be, the back of whose head do you talk to the most?  There's no walking away.  Who takes a really deep breath when you walk up to say hello?  Like I said, the people at work are the people at work, and they love me. 
[03:43:00]  That's great.  That's great.  What did your last period, what was that like?  None of that.  It was not remarkable?  And it went, and that was it.  What happened?  It came and it went.  I have not gotten any of the symptoms or anything.  No, was it?  Could you tell, though?  Were you like, oh, this has got to be the end of the tank?  No, this is what I'm talking about.  There was some sediment in it.  Yeah.  It had grinds like fucking Sunoco coffee.  I don't know something's going on.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, you didn't know?  I know.  It's amazing.  You really do have, you have the timing of a fucking, of a fucking rhino.  You just, like, here's what you have to do.  Like, when you see people laughing, you hear them laughing, you pause for a second.  Yeah, I can just feel it out.  Yeah.  Let them, yeah, get the laughter out.  Because nobody hears half what you're saying.  I'm not trying to shit on you, but nobody hears half what you're saying.  Fucking retard father was.  Jesus.  I'm going to do my impression of you.  I want you to see.  Okay.  Louis, say something in the crowd.  We'll laugh. 
[03:44:00]  Okay.  Now you put pressure on me to get it.  Yeah, that's a lot of confidence.  I knew I was going to come back down, but they made Kobe this private world.  My father was true.  Oh.  So I'd have bruises all over.  Heavens to murgatory.  But if you pause, people will hear what you're saying.  Yeah, Patty.  Yeah.  When's the hypnotist coming in?  We're tentatively scheduled for the 14th or the 12th of Friday after the 4th. 
[03:44:30]  A week from the 4th.  Have you been hypnotized before, Patty?  Never.  You think he'll go under?  I don't know.  I've never been hypnotized.  We'll have to see.  It can't be one of those wacky hypnotists that, you know, make you do wacky things.  It's got to be like one of those hypnotists that can hypnotize you and then really kind  of get in there.  The Ron Fez guy.  He does that stuff too, but he's the real deal.  He's definitely the real deal.  Yeah.  Okay, I'm open to it.  And you're willing to... 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, I'm open-minded.  Are you?  Yeah, I'm very fascinated by that kind of thing.  And this has fucked up her sexuality for her whole life.  She will not be with a man.  She's a virgin.  You can see from all that's happened to her that she's got to protect herself.  She would withdraw and wince.  Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong.  I've always wanted to have a serious relationship with somebody.  Just that I, you know, I guess, you know. 
[03:45:30]  She's actually doing pretty well considering her back then.  You know, and I've had questions on...  Left on a...  Shut up!  Trying to fucking say something positive about you.  I'm trying to say something positive about you.  Now, Louie, why would you yell at Jake Johansson like that?  I don't know why I'm so mad at Hitler if he'd survive.  She kind of looks like an old Hitler. 
[03:46:00]  If he shaved.  Look, I just think that...  Look, she was left on a diner counter for fuck's sake.  Yeah.  Raised by a couple of fucking creeps.  Animals, yep.  Schizophrenic mom and brother.  Some nurse shoved a tampon up her fucking pussy.  And she's doing pretty well considering.  Yeah.  I think, seriously, I think she's got a positive attitude.  Yeah.  She's doing terrific.  She's got a positive attitude.  She feels love from people at her work.  And she likes coming here and sharing her life with us. 
[03:46:30]  She's all right.  I like Patty.  Here's the thing.  Let me just correct you.  She's misreading their hatred at work.  And she's never had a dick in her.  No, but that's it.  That's fine.  Yes.  That's all true, but she's got a positive attitude considering.  Hey, Patty.  She goes to work and people literally go, ugh.  And she says, they love me there.  And I think that's a testament to her positive attitude.  It is.  And I don't mean this in a real, but this who should eat.  I'm kidding, Patty.  None taken. 
[03:47:00]  Patty, how did the nurse show you the tampon?  Like, did she put it in you or did she show you with something else?  She just went with hand motion.  She made her do a hand, she made her do a hand, she made her do a hand, she made her do a handstand and then threw it like a javelin stick.  She made her do a shot with the area one.  Placing cunt light fuse, get away.  She showed me on a chart where it went.  A chart?  A chart.  Yeah, she showed me a photo and then it goes here and then she went like that with the motion, the correct motion and that was it. 
[03:47:30]  She said, you slip it in there.  And did you have trouble the first time you tried to put it in?  Of course I did, yeah.  And what happened the first time?  It was painful the first two times.  After that, it was easy.  Did you get it in deep enough?  Yeah.  You probably, because I can picture you just putting the tip in and fucking cotton's hanging out of it.  It's hanging out like a cigar.  Yeah, but I was okay after the third month of doing it.  Third month.  It took you three months to figure out how to shove a fucking tampon in it.  It took her three months before she figured out she had to take the first one out. 
[03:48:00]  Did you tell the nurse, so I got a stab at three times?  I just thanked her and said if I have any questions, I'll call you.  I didn't have any questions.  I learned on my own.  Yeah.  You did.  I bet you did though.  You didn't put it in far enough the first time.  Right.  Because you were hurt.  Was it painful?  Yeah, the first time.  Was it a little exciting though?  Were you kind of like, ooh, I'm putting something in my pussy?  Yeah, the thing I liked best was the convenience.  Any question you want to answer. 
[03:48:30]  Forget the one I asked.  I like the convenience.  What's convenience?  All right, 7-Eleven cunt.  Anyone else getting the feeling that she's not talking about tampons here and she's talking  about her dad?  Of course.  He was there.  After three months.  Yeah.  So Patty, how did you put it in?  I'd lie on the couch sideways and then try and shove it in.  That's how things go in there.  The nurse just said, sit down on the toilet and do it. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  The toilet, yeah.  Right on the toilet.  That's where things go in your private.  That's nice.  First time you violated yourself, you were reading Beetle Bailey.  Sit on the toilet.  That's where the private gross things happen.  All right.  Well, hypnotist for Patty in the very first year.  Yeah, definitely.  All right.  We're going to do line of the day.  Get these folks out of here so they can go to Unmasked with Louis C.K.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:49:30]  And where again tonight?  State.  I can't remember you.  The State Theater in New Brunswick.  Tonight.  Tonight.  That's right.  8 o'clock.  Don't go to Vinny's Club.  Go see.  Go instead.  All New Jokes.  Who's at you guys called tonight?  Who is the competition?  Oh, um.  It's Jim David.  Jim David.  Jim David.  He's so funny.  Way funny than Louis C.K.  Yeah, and I probably, you know, I don't really know.  Oh! 
[03:50:00]  No, if you want to see Louis C.K., you can go to the State Theater.  It's in East Brunswick.  Oh.  Main street.  That's great.  Oh, yeah.  She's a smartass.  I love it.  I love it.  She just came out.  Two cities over.  That makes me so happy.  Wow.  Look at that fucking contrast between her and Patty.  Oh, that's crazy.  Look at what can go awfully wrong.  They're made up of the same chemicals.  But that's where the fucking thing ends. 
[03:50:30]  No, they actually are not.  Really?  They are.  One is sugar and spice and one is shit.  I had to.  I had to.  Of course.  And you know her.  I didn't know I was made of sugar and spice.  Oh, thank you, Jimmy.  That's very sweet.  It was romantic.  Take.  Jesus.  Sorry, Lloyd.  All right, Pat.  I don't remember what happened.  In the bathtub.  The father's walking in.  Fuck.  In this house, he wants to shave? 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  No doors.  Yeah.  No doors allowed.  That's right.  It's a little fucking...  No, but I don't know.  Her house is a little rat maze.  She goes, dad.  And he goes, give me a fuck.  You think I'm looking at you?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Stop it.  Check him out, diner mooch.  And a basket.  What are you fucking...  She's one of the little rascals.  Let's do line of the day.

Let's go with the first one.  You can do one.  We don't have any of them loaded yet.  That's what I was thinking.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock, not E-Rock.  E-Rock, get in here.  How is it 11.15 and then not loaded?  It's 11.15.  Get in here, E-Rock.  Give E-Rock the welcome he's due when he walks in. 
[03:52:00]  Hello, shit dick.  What happened, E-Rock?  I don't do line of the day.  They were finishing cutting up some last minute ones.  They haven't loaded it yet.  You don't do it.  You're usually the subject of it.  So we told Danny to stall because we weren't ready yet.  I said we could at least start because a few of them were cut.  I don't have it.  The rundown or what everybody voted on.  Oh, Jesus.  Is this embarrassing?  I'll play stuff randomly. 
[03:52:30]  Why don't you just...  I'm not attacking him.  I'm just saying the list wasn't done yet.  Why don't you entertain the crowd while we wait for it?  Because what are we supposed to do?  Stretch?  You guys want to hear a joke from E-Rock?  Yes!  All right.  E-Rock.  I set up the microphone for E-Rock.  I set up the microphone for E-Rock.  Sam's cheering.  Yeah.  Eric's going to stretch his shirts.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Jimmy, would you like to do the intro for our next comedian, E-Rock?  All right.  Yeah, here we go.  Ladies and gentlemen.  You might recognize your next... 
[03:53:00]  Look at the panic in his face.  It's purple.  You might recognize your next performer.  That's it.  Then again, maybe you won't.  All right.  Coming to the stage, E-Rock, everyone.  E-Rock, turn around and tell a joke. 
[03:53:30]  I don't have any jokes.  Face the crowd.  Face the crowd, not us.  You need confidence.  I have no jokes.  How do you not have any jokes?  How do you not have any fucking jokes?  Tell a joke.  I don't know any jokes.  Any jokes.  Start talking about something.  From the time you were a kid until now, you've never heard one fucking joke in your life.  I don't remember any jokes.  Any.  Just face the crowd.  Just start talking.  Just start talking.  Tell a joke.  Or do an impression.  Do something.  Talk about something funny. 
[03:54:00]  A funny anecdote from your life.  Yeah, let's go.  Yes.  Yeah, tell them something funny that happened to you recently.  Go.  Go.  Funny.  Turn your whole body towards them.  Turn your whole body.  Don't.  Yeah.  Dead.  Don't turn.  They'll think they're watching Alfred Hitchcock.  That's right.  Oh, that's right.  Okay.  Oh, this is the whole.  Let's see.  One time, I punched my grandmother in the side of the face.  He's killing me.  It's not a joke.  It's just a little anecdote here. 
[03:54:30]  Well, why don't you tell what led up to it, you dummy?  Exactly.  What did the old cunt do?  Face the crowd.  Face the crowd.  You're doing good.  No, this isn't funny.  This is just...  What happened?  I'm punching her in the face.  The rest of the story isn't that funny.  Why'd you punch her in the face?  Because she had a tendency to be abusive to a lot of the children in our family.  So, um... 
[03:55:00]  Oh, there's more!  Oh, yeah, there's more.  So, how was she abusive, Irak?  I'm curious.  All right.  Am I...  Because she was...  No mayonnaise.  Eat all mayonnaise.  Physically abusive?  Yeah, very physically abusive.  Did you make your soup on the couch with her?  He's shaking.  Oh, I have mayonnaise jokes.  Thank you.  Wait.  Fuck those, man.  Face my voice, please.  Yeah, I know.  All right, let me bring them in the middle of the story.  Okay.  Irak.  Yeah, we want to hear the story.  All right.  Keep going.  He's doing fine.  In my family, a lot of the kids are in fours. 
[03:55:30]  They're in fours?  What do you mean?  I thought you were going to say fat.  My parents had four kids.  Their siblings had four kids.  So, everybody was in fours.  So, don't let it faze you.  It's a heckler.  Don't let it faze you.  Go through the heckler.  Let's go.  Let's go.  So, all the kids were born in fours.  She was just this miserable old bitch that nobody liked in the family.  So, she would pick two kids from each set of four that she liked. 
[03:56:00]  No, not touching.  What was your name?  No.  So, that she liked and two that she either chose that didn't exist or she got really abusive  to.  Which one were you?  Yeah.  Which one were you?  Huh?  I was one of the two that either didn't exist or was being abusive to her.  So.  Not us.  Them.  Okay.  So, one time I'm watching.  I think I'm like six, seven, somewhere in there.  We're watching TV and it happened to be wrestling.  And my younger sister didn't want to watch it. 
[03:56:30]  She wanted to watch some stupid ballet thing.  So, she switched the channel.  I screamed.  Fuck you.  And then, so I switched it back to wrestling.  So, she ran off.  So, she ran off crying and then the next thing I know, I hear like this stomping down the  hallway.  It's my grandmother who was babysitting us at the time.  How loud was it?  So, she comes over, starts screaming, grabs me and picks me up and throws me into some other 
[03:57:00]  furniture.  Right?  She's in her early 60s, right?  So, she picked me up and threw me into some furniture and then she grabbed me again and  started by the neck and the shirt and started screaming at me.  So, I turned around and I clocked her in the side of the face.  She went down into the piece of furniture and I went running, screaming and locked myself  in my parents' room.  I bring nothing to the table. 
[03:57:30]  I don't do fully work.  Sorry.  So, I locked myself in the bedroom screaming and I was just, I think I called my dad.  I was in my dad's office at the time he was working late and every person that picked  up the phone heard me just screaming and yelling, didn't know what was going on, just  passed me around through most of the company until it finally got to my dad.  And, uh, I'm making a hat.  I'm making a hat.  Why are you wearing a hat?  No.  Uh, uh, uh, how about we have E-Rock do fat jokes? 
[03:58:00]  Let's, uh, let's end with E-Rock telling fat jokes.  Okay.  Come on now.  Uh.  And just, uh, make sure they're all...  I'm.  This is...  I'm.  I'm.  So fat that...  This isn't even a joke.  Just laugh on me, boy.  Where's the fat joke?  Steve gave me a story.  This isn't even a joke.  What is this, too?  I'm so fat that...  Fat jokes!  Fat jokes!  I don't have any fat jokes.  What's the story he gave you?  What's the story he gave you?  Yeah.  Um, it says...  It's about somebody who wanted to be a musician but became a homosexual. 
[03:58:30]  It's from a yet-to-be-released autobiography.  Good.  I'll ever explain it.  That's good.  Come on.  What's the story, E-Rock?  Um, it's titled Mexican Mayonnaise Joke.  Uh, most people don't know that back in 1912, Hellman's mayonnaise was manufactured in England.  In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Veracruz, Mexico, 
[03:59:00]  which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after it stopped in New York.  This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico.  But, as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York.  The ship hit an iceberg and sank.  The cargo was lost forever.  The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise and were eagerly awaiting its delivery,  were disconsolate at the loss.  I have a question. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  What does that word mean?  I have no idea.  How do you spell it?  You can't be consoled.  D-I-S-C-O-N-S-O-L-A-T-E.  Okay.  Alright.  Uh, their anguish was so great that they declared a national day of mourning,  which they still observe to this day.  The national day of mourning occurs each year on May 5th.  By the way, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It stinks, and I don't like it. 
[04:00:00]  It stinks, and I don't like it.  It stinks, and I don't like it.  It stinks, and I don't like it.  Alright, well.  He said Cinco de Mayo, didn't he?  Yeah, I am fucking really depressed now.  Yeah, we're all just exhausted.  Let's do the first runner-up line of the day.  Oh, God.  The only one that I actually read was the one that said what they wanted to do to me.  That was, beat me with a lead pipe. 
[04:00:30]  That lady got a runner-up line of the day.  She earned it.  Somebody's got to let her know.  That's a great line, though.  Come on.  Right to the next one.  It's the second amendment.  You've got to be able to say whatever you want.  And then shoot whoever doesn't like it.  Shoot whoever doesn't like what you said.  Very funny. 
[04:01:00]  The next runner-up line of the day.  And what's hanging in the air is that everybody wants to fuck her tits into a blue line.  Comics, 1 o'clock, 14th and 9th Avenue.  Next runner-up line of the day.  She's actually doing pretty well considering her back then.  You know, they've got questions on...  Left on it, shut up!  I'm fucking saying something positive about you.  Let's hear it for Stalker Patty today. 
[04:01:30]  She will be hypnotized on our show in two weeks.  Two weeks.  July 11th.  July 11th.  Next runner-up.  A beautiful pink and white blanket.  Wait, wait, what?  What was the diner?  What was the diner?  Downtowners Restaurant.  Downtown at One Trinity Place.  It's not there anymore.  I went back to look for it.  Of course not.  Who would eat there after that?  Someone left shit on the counter.  Which is another thing, too.  I've been trying to find out... 
[04:02:00]  Oh, Jesus!  God damn it.  How many more?  One?  All right, one more runner-up.  It's like you'll be going through a mountain.  There'll be like two lanes will go down to one lane.  Like, for both directions.  And there'll be big boulders on top.  So if the war starts, they set off charges to drop the boulders to block off all the roads.  It's in charge of the army.  The coyote?  The coyote?  Ridiculous. 
[04:02:30]  Very nice.  You guys have fun today.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes...  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  So here, put that one and...  Put it on?  She didn't tell you how or anything?  She wore, like, a hat.  Put it on. 
[04:03:00]  Put a fucking daisy on it.  She showed me where it was things.  It looked like Laura Ingalls' bonnet.  At that time, you had all the kids.  Had ketchup on it.  Why is the retarded girl wearing a Japanese flag on her?  I tried to just babble through that whole thing.  Babble, babble, babble.  I want to suck your cocks.  Whoa!  That was a good tag.  All right, guys. 
[04:03:30]  We'll see you soon.  Thanks for coming by.  Have a good weekend with you guys Monday.  Hopefully. </pre>
