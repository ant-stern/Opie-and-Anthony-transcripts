<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a recap of the previous day's underwhelming food segment featuring celebrity chef Steven Starr, focusing on the simplicity of the salsa and guacamole.  This led to a discussion of negative listener feedback on Twitter and the evolving sensitivities surrounding language, particularly the use of the word "retard."  Listener complaints about the show's "Lady Di" segments were addressed, with the hosts defending their humor.  A significant portion focused on a "guac-off" contest on the Covino and Rich show, where Opie and Anthony staffer Roland unexpectedly won by strategically mixing leftovers with Starr's guacamole.  Audio clips from Covino and Rich's show were played, and listeners Chris and Mike called in to discuss the event and other show-related grievances, including complaints about Sam's pre-show segment.  The controversy surrounding Roland's win, including accusations of sabotage and potential vote rigging, was extensively discussed.  Other topics touched upon included Seth Rogen's upcoming movie, Pearl Jam's fight with Ticketmaster, a Cronut update, further "Lady Di" updates (including a call from Marion detailing an embarrassing incident), Donald Sterling's legal battle, and Derek Jeter's declining performance.

The show continued with a discussion of Jeter's Hall of Fame prospects and a debate regarding Leslie Jones' controversial *Saturday Night Live* sketch about slavery, involving a heated exchange with caller Corey.  A news story about a man brutally kicking a cat sparked visceral reactions.  Seth Rogen then joined the show, discussing his new movie *Neighbors*, including nude scenes and anecdotes about working with various actresses and porn stars.  He also shared stories about *This is the End* and *Knocked Up*.  Airplane stories, including one about a woman having loud sex in an airplane bathroom, were recounted.  Rogen also discussed James Franco's movie about *The Room* and his painting of Rogen nude.

The next segment featured Seth Rogen discussing his upcoming projects, including his reaction to Jonah Hill's Oscar nominations, and a 1940s buddy cop movie with Kevin Hart.  Lisa Kudrow's performance in *Neighbors* was praised.  Danny Falcone then joined the show, engaging in highly explicit and vulgar conversation detailing his masturbatory habits.  Discussions about Falcone DJing at Anthony Cumia's Fourth of July party and the logistics of upcoming live shows ensued.  Following Falcone's departure, the hosts discussed the kitten-kicking incident using highly offensive language, followed by a discussion of Stephen Starr sending tacos as an apology and Willie Mays' birthday.  The segment concluded with a discussion of powdered alcohol and Sal Governale recounting explicit and humorous anecdotes from an all-male camping trip.

Another segment centered around the all-male camping trip, with sexually explicit descriptions and listener calls questioning the trip's location, defending Lady Di, and debating the presence of coyotes in New York. Discussions about the TV show *24*, *Jurassic Park*, the upcoming *Rich Voss* movie, and potential appearances in Chris Rock and Kevin Pollack films took place.  A caller shared a story about having an affair with Donald Sterling, and another criticized the show.  The segment concluded with a discussion of *Louie*, a Yiddish rock band featured in the show, and a YouTube video of Hasidic Jews performing Hotel California.  The conversation throughout was highly sexually explicit and offensive.

The final segment began with a discussion about a shortened song and included crude, stereotypical comments about Jewish people.  Listener calls followed, including Joe's anecdote about spitting beer on his infant son and Bart's critique of the music.  Further offensive remarks were made before concluding with a Mother's Day advertisement.  The post-show segment, featuring Sam Roberts, included suggestive innuendo about his all-male camping trip.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Ah, good morning everyone.  Oi.  Let's do this again, huh?  Oi, oi, oi, oi.  Again.  And again.  And again.  And again.  Why not?  What else are we going to do, right?  Right?  Why not then?  Why not then?  I was thinking about our food segment yesterday on the way in.  It was classic.  One for the ages, right? 
[00:00:30]  One for the ages.  Yeah, that was great.  Chips, salsa, and fucking guacamole.  By one of the biggest restaurant owners in the country.  If not the world.  Steven Starr is really famous in that world.  That's great.  Isn't that then like Bill Gates bringing you a fucking old calculator?  Pretty much.  Like, he should have had something really nice for us.  Amazing.  And he had fucking table scraps. 
[00:01:00]  We were just being polite and nice going, well, yeah, the salsa tastes good and the guacamole tastes good.  It did, but, you know, who cares?  Where's the good eats?  Yeah.  One of the good eats coming.  Yeah.  And then you go to Twitter and you have to deal with fucking losers.  No, never.  What are you talking about?  It's just people that really.  Great.  Why do you spend so much time on just fucking hating on us?  There's a whole world out there.  Is there?  Go do something with yourself.  You're going to fast forward a bunch of years and go, wow, I've wasted so many fucking years just trying to beat the shit out of those guys. 
[00:01:30]  Are you talking to me?  Are you secretly fucking tweeting me?  I'll kick your ass.  No, I just get into a lot of arguments over on Twitter.  That's your thing, I guess.  I do spend a lot of time.  The thing is, I just know I can't.  I just don't want.  I can do that.  I just don't.  I don't want to because you can't change the mind of a hater.  You can come up with the greatest argument, the greatest point, you know you're right, and you're a heart of hearts, and they will still spin that shit. 
[00:02:00]  So it's not worth my time.  But I get frustrated because people like pointing out the guacamole salsa thing from yesterday, like going, see, another food segment.  Finally, you guys got burnt.  Maybe you can move on from that shit finally.  Holy shit.  It's like there was comedy and humor in that.  It wasn't about the fact the guy never had tacos or whatever. 
[00:02:30]  It was the fact that we had a major restaurant guy, and in the end, we're eating stupid salsa that you could have got out of a jar, pretty much.  Some people just don't understand this program, and I don't know why they continue to listen to it.  I don't either.  I don't get it.  Look, if you look at the bit, it's a food bit.  And, yeah, that's why we joke about it because food segments are kind of stupid.  Right.  And that's why we try to find our angles and, you know, kind of make something out of it. 
[00:03:00]  They didn't have the tacos yesterday.  How many people walked in saying...  It's the greatest.  And, you know, a lot of people walked in after that segment going, that was fucking hilarious how ridiculous that was.  It was so much better than if he actually brought the fucking tacos.  Right.  Believe me, we're sick of fucking sitting here eating on the air talking about somebody's food.  You're absolutely right.  It's better than if the tacos arrived.  You're right.  I loved it.  But these simple...  I think they're simpletons or something.  Simpleton. 
[00:03:30]  We used to call them retards in the day.  Right.  Now the S word we call them.  Simpleton.  I was thinking about that word.  I think that's the one word that really scares me.  Retard?  Yeah.  Oh.  It's starting to scare me.  Is it?  Like, it could be big trouble?  I don't feel comfortable saying it as much.  I don't know.  I don't know.  They're getting to you.  That's...  Yeah, but I've never meant it in a...  Not many people did.  Never meant it in a hateful way.  I would never, ever fucking point to someone that might be, you know...  Handicapable, I say. 
[00:04:00]  And say that.  Yes.  But I don't know.  That word is starting to feel really uncomfortable.  Yeah.  A little creepy.  I don't know.  I don't know.  This fucking PC shit is wearing us out, I think.  I don't use it that much.  And I don't...  Really?  And you sound like an asshole when you start to...  No, we should be able to say retard.  You know what I mean?  You really do have to pick your battles.  And that's probably not one.  So that feels weird, too.  Because, you know, we're all about...  You should be able to express yourself.  And if you want to be an asshole about it, so be it. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  I just lump it into the whole thing where I think every word in context, you could use  any word in comedy, drama, your regular life, whatever it is.  Right.  But, you know, every word you should have the capability of using.  Right.  I don't think banning words is very good.  But, you know, you can't get on the soapbox and yell, yes, we want to bring back retard  into the vernacular.  You really don't.  You just want it to be understood that you should be allowed to say whatever word you 
[00:05:00]  want.  Right.  And I mean whatever word you want.  Yeah.  But you can't really...  It's getting harder to fight for it because you've got to say some ridiculous things.  You've really got to sound silly.  Right.  To defend some of this shit.  All right.  We'll get to the marrying thing.  We'll get to the Lady Di update.  Oh, boy.  That's another thing.  People are like, enough with the Lady Di.  They hate her.  That just makes me, you know, want to take that phone call more, to be honest with you.  If you really want her to go away, don't even mention her on my Twitter, please.  Right. 
[00:05:30]  Because if you didn't find the humor in that yesterday, like you said, the show might have  passed you by.  Maybe not for you.  I mean, we have the biggest audience that we've ever had on satellite radio.  Yeah.  So we're doing something right.  But I think when you bring in, you know, more people start listening, then...  Then there's people that the show's just not for them anymore.  Right.  And they're holding on to something.  I mean, there's a million things to go listen to.  But they're holding on to stuff and giving suggestions of what we shouldn't do on a daily basis. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  Just shut the fuck up.  And unfortunately, you know, things have changed.  So the reason why you liked us in the first place, maybe that has passed you by.  You know, we can't do a lot of that shit that we used to be able to do.  Bon voyage, then.  Well, why would you listen to something you just don't like?  I don't get...  I don't know.  I've never reached out to a show...  Never.  ...that I didn't like.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, I've reached out to people that frustrate me, and I try to, you know, 
[00:06:30]  hit them with something, but...  And even that, I don't do that much anymore.  It's just not worth it.  Nah.  But the Lady Di shit was funny yesterday, too.  It's great.  We learn a little more.  She's nuts.  She's crazy.  And then we have another update on her.  And how could we not tell that update after the briefing I got?  Right.  I mean, what, are we just going to let that sit there?  No.  Well, we're going to talk about it in a few minutes, but there's somebody that wants to  talk about the guac-off.  I'm hearing things about the guac-off, too.  Yeah, yeah.  I heard stuff about that. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, boy.  By the way, can I...  Fuck it.  Oh, no.  How much more can we possibly do this stupid show anyway?  The Covino and Rich guac-off is the stupidest radio bit I've ever heard.  That was the whole...  Another bridge.  The whole thing was...  And I like those guys.  Well, I like Rich.  I don't...  Wait, which one is the one I...  Oh, no.  We see Rich every day.  Covino, I don't know if you've heard.  All right.  No.  No, it's not that I don't like Covino.  I just...  I've seen him once.  I did the show once, and I saw him face-to-face, and he was a nice guy, but I don't know him. 
[00:07:30]  But the Covino and Rich guac-off, they've been doing it for nine years.  It's so stupid.  Well, that's my favorite part of the thing, was that you guys had just spent a whole segment  of the show saying that having guac and chips was not an appropriate radio segment.  Right.  So for this to be a big annual event, open to the public, left it ripe for sabotage.  Yeah.  But what can you do with guac?  Nothing.  You can chop some onions in it.  We had guac and mold.  You can do some paprika.  Yeah.  Or pistachios.  Or pistachios.  Ice cream. 
[00:08:00]  Ice cream.  Well, that would probably be good.  Chocolate ice cream and guac?  I don't think so.  All right.  When you've had one guacamole, you pretty much have had it all.  And Stephen Starr brought in guac yesterday.  It was really good.  But it wasn't anything fucking special.  Wait, and who cares who makes the best guacamole?  It's avocado and a little onion and a little tomato.  Once a year.  What could you possibly do with it?  Mix it in a bowl.  They should have...  Hold on a minute, Chris.  I'm getting to you.  I mean, a chili cook-off is nice. 
[00:08:30]  You could do a lot of different things with chili.  But guacamole.  Let's think of the mayo.  And they've been doing it for nine years?  Yeah.  I hate all cook-offs.  Oh, do you?  They're all stupid.  I make a better...  I don't know.  My burger's pretty good.  Shut up.  Hears.  You ever go to the place where they open up...  Hold on, Chris.  They take the guacamole thing or whatever it is.  Right.  And they scoop it out in front of you and grind it up in front of you.  That's good.  Know why they do that?  Why?  Because they know it's nothing.  So they're trying to make it look fancier. 
[00:09:00]  They're trying to schnazzy it up.  So they think if they make it in front of you, you go, wow, wow, this is something very  special.  I just want to show you how even an ape can do this.  Just cut the avocado.  You mush the onion.  Dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk.  You pour a little shit in.  Here you go.  Nice.  I don't understand what you can really do with it.  And with that, Chris, go ahead.  All right.  I'm listening to the...  You know, I listen to you guys in the morning and then throughout the day.  And then I listen to Covino and Rich.  Hi, Anthony. 
[00:09:30]  I'm a friend on your Facebook, by the way.  I'm Chris.  Oh, that's the gentleman.  One of the few gentlemen.  You guys are awesome.  You guys...  Of course we are.  I'm telling you, I've been listening to you since I had to...  Point.  Point.  Point.  So I got the Covino and Rich on in the afternoon, and they're doing the guac off, and the Christina  comes out off.  And then Roland and Sam.  Roland brings the stuff that his mother made.  He said his mother made it.  He said his grandma made it.  He said his abuelita's recipe. 
[00:10:00]  Wait, you brought some of the Stephen Starr guacamole in there?  So what Roland did was, we had leftovers, Stephen Starr brought in one guac with goat  cheese, and one guac with pistachio.  So Roland took the two containers and mixed them into one.  Oh.  And then he wrapped tinfoil around it, and then he told Covino and Rich that he had some  homemade guac, and he would like to enter the contest.  Did we got clips?  Yeah.  Oh, great.  And then, it was great, because before the show started, Rich went over to Roland, and 
[00:10:30]  he goes, Roland, you know, I saw the container that you have.  Meanwhile, while Rich is talking to him, the box of chips with, like, the restaurant logo  and all this stuff is right on Roland's desk, so we're thinking, oh, shit, but...  He probably didn't think that another employee would cheat at a guacamole contest.  That's right.  It's incomprehensible.  Right?  He goes, Roland, you might want to make more, because if you run out, people aren't going  to be able to vote for your guac.  Oh, shit. 
[00:11:00]  And Roland goes, like, in a snap, he goes, oh, oh, I can't make more, because the ingredients  have to sit overnight.  The lime juice marinade has to sit.  Oh, shit.  Who, is that, fucking Woody Allen?  That's funny.  Tell the rest of the story.  Huh?  Please tell the rest of the story.  No, I don't want to...  If we have clips, I don't want to know the rest of the story.  Yes.  We will...  We'll let it play out on our show.  We'll run through it ourselves, sir.  Because I'm just hearing about this, thank God, so I have no idea how it ended.  It was an independent venture by the staff. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, is he a chatty...  Thank you, Chris.  He's lonely.  Chatty Cathy.  Chris is scared the most.  I was just trying to include him, and we didn't even need him, to be honest with you.  We didn't even need you, Chris.  We were just trying to include you in a nice little conversation.  We need friends.  And you have to put that out there, because he was babbling.  Sometimes we just take a call, and we're just like, hey, man, hang with us for a little  while.  But we don't really need you.  No.  But let's say hi to Mike in Virginia.  Mikey.  Back around yelling.  Hey, I love you guys, but the pre-show thing is killing me. 
[00:12:00]  Like, I'm in my car from 6 till 7, and I only get you guys and your pure entertainment  for 30 minutes.  And then I've got to listen to that man-child for 30 minutes.  Man-child.  So why are you listening to it, then?  That's what I tell him.  I don't understand.  There's so many channels.  I really don't understand anymore that people would suffer through something they don't  like.  Yeah.  Like, we have to change the start time of the show so this asshole can- 
[00:12:30]  Look, as much as we beat the shit out of Sam, I like his pre-show.  Period.  Okay?  And what about, you could record the whole show now?  How about-  We live in an on-demand world, so if you only hear a half hour of the show, why wouldn't  you take an hour of yesterday's show that you didn't hear and listen to that on the way  in?  How about instead of calling and asking Opie and Anthony to start work a half hour  earlier?  Why don't you start your work a half hour later, and that way you could adjust your  commute? 
[00:13:00]  You little shit.  All right.  Go eat some chicken fingers.  Good one.  I see good points on both sides.  Go eat a chicken finger does make sense, and shut up, sir, also makes sense.  But there's workarounds.  Oh, my God.  It's not the old days where, you know, you had to, like, find a cassette and record it.  That's true.  No, and it's not that I dislike Sam.  I just-  Oh, thank God.  I feel so much better.  All right.  It's your pal.  You made your point.  I think it's kind of ridiculous, though.  Thank you, Mike.  All right.  Let's go to the Covino and Rich Guacoff, where Roland pretty much sabotaged the whole thing. 
[00:13:30]  Yes, he did.  He probably made it really entertaining for once.  Oh.  It was the, literally, the first time that people were actually talking about the Guacoff.  Excited.  When we left, people were like, holy shit, I can't believe what just happened.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  It was that we added some action.  So, Roland introduces himself to the show.  This was in the fishbowl, right?  It's a big deal.  Yeah, they could get the fishbowl.  They had signage made for it.  Oh, wow.  I saw a little poster up by the bathroom this morning. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, they put flyers everywhere around the building.  What did the poster by the bathroom say?  For anyone who was in the Guacoffoff, please feel free to get rid of that nonsense here.  Destroy one of the stalls.  And do they play it straight?  Yes.  Hell yeah.  Oh, my God.  Why?  Dude.  Were there jokes at least?  No.  Oh, God.  You don't joke about Guacoffoff.  I'll explain more as the clips play out, but they take it very seriously.  But why would you?  Well, Guacamole is serious business to a lot of people.  It's really the starter to a Mexican meal. 
[00:14:30]  It's supposed to be Cinco de Mayo.  That's true.  Oh, this sounds awful.  It's really the play setter.  Yeah.  Am I right or wrong, Roland?  It's the palate warmer-upper.  Warmer-upper.  We're no strangers to shit radio.  I'll be honest with you, bud.  Those strangers were the fucking masters of it.  Very familiar.  But we do what's called a one-and-done.  We'll try something, it doesn't work, and we move the fuck on.  They're nine years in?  Nine years in.  Oh, my God.  All right.  So Roland introduces himself to the Guacoff with Covino and Rich. 
[00:15:00]  And I do like those guys.  They're good guys.  I don't really know the show.  And I really don't know Covino.  So I like Rich.  They're good guys.  They're good guys.  Rich is a good guy.  And now we have a wild card entry, like a last-minute, like,  are you really coming in here and mix this up and make it more difficult?  Oh, God.  Can we make this officially, Jocktober?  Oh, no.  We'll taste the Jocktober.  No, don't do that.  Don't fucking...  Don't fuck those guys.  No.  Just we have...  Please. 
[00:15:30]  We had enough fun being on their show and turning it into something else entirely.  He is.  Yes.  And he's talking smack.  Rolando!  Yes.  Roland from Uppie Anthony.  What's up, man?  Dude, there you go.  What's going on, Roland, everybody?  There you go.  Yeah.  All the other contestants, they're known as cunts.  Boom.  Show it up your ass, bitches.  This is the golden guy.  Here's what I'm going to...  Holy shit.  Not a second on the air. 
[00:16:00]  Fucking Roland.  He drops the old C-bomb.  What a jerk.  You're a jerk.  Roland's a jerk.  Are you allowed to do fucking C-bombs on that channel?  I was going to say, for context, Covino and Rich is a much nicer show than this show.  I would assume.  It's family friendly.  I mean, they'll curse here and there.  Right.  Right.  But I don't remember the last time a C-bomb was brought...  Not like that.  They don't call the other contestants cunts?  Right.  For no reason?  You think some listeners might have turned their head and looked at their radio at that moment? 
[00:16:30]  Who is this guy?  What the...  Wow.  It's a contest to be serious.  All right.  Let's go.  Wow.  All right.  Fucking smack.  That's a great entrance.  I'll tell you right now.  Yeah.  Kenny.  I'm very upset about this situation.  Hang on.  You're going to spoil stuff.  All right.  You can say that in any room he walks into.  What?  There's a big reveal or something?  He's upset about the way it played out, I think.  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  Okay.  All right.  Well, wait for your chance.  We've just begun to fight.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  The drama.  Golden God.  Here's what I'm hearing.  That's trash talk right there.  Roland from Opie and Anthony's show is here.  He's Mexican, so he's also representing...  I'm pure Mexican.  Are you 100%?  I swim across the border.  Really?  I'm Mexican.  So, hold on.  This makes it...  Wow.  Let me tell you something.  This makes it even more heated.  Here's why.  I'm only half...  I'm going to put the finishing touches on spots to give it the Mexican love, okay? 
[00:17:30]  You can try, but it's not like it smells.  Listen.  I don't even fucking smell.  It smells like my aunt's Nuglas.  Here's what you've got to worry about.  Jose Mangan is a three-time champion.  As you know, he's talked about it.  Exactly.  Wow.  No, really.  There's a lot of bragging rights.  That's a good recipe my Waelita made for me.  Now, hold on.  Hold on, Roland.  See, this is a family recipe.  Oh, Jesus.  What if it doesn't win?  Are you going to be offended and hurt by this?  Then screw my Waelita.  She made shit there. 
[00:18:00]  It's going to win.  It's going to win.  It's like Kavito and Rich are used to the sort of, you kind of know where it's going.  It's all in good fun.  Take a radio.  When you drop in and when you just throw a grenade in, like, Roland, they don't exactly  know where to go with this.  They're used to good-natured ribbing.  Like, you know, what if it doesn't win?  Well, then we'll have to come back next year and see.  Fuck my grandma.  Yeah, she makes shit.  Holy shit. 
[00:18:30]  Is that funny?  Oh, Roland.  Jose enters.  Roland is unimpressed.  Jose enters and, like.  And he's won three times.  He's won three times and they take it so seriously.  Like, Jose is the metal guy who's been on this show before.  Right, sure.  Yes.  But he's wearing, like, an apron and he's got a sombrero and he's got, like, 15 employees  from the company.  Wow.  Marching in with him and one guy's playing a guitar and one of them's wearing a poncho.  He's doing fucking an entrance like WWE.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's good.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Dramatic.  I like it.  Here's Jose entering.  He's got a sombrero on, a Slayer apron.  Yeah.  And he has his golden mocajete.  His guacamole.  I'm doing it for Mexico, cabrones.  Wow.  Now, hold on.  Thank you, Jose.  Jose, I don't know.  Roland's talking smack.  Yeah, Roland says you got shit.  He said, he basically, he's from, he brought this from the border.  Man, it's probably stinking holes, you know?  The border's a far way away, homies. 
[00:19:30]  I got it from your grandma's vagina.  This has never been an inappropriate contest until now.  But you're like, I got to be a dead grandma under his vagina.  She must be like, well, because she's been dead for a while.  Fucking Roland killing on another show. 
[00:20:00]  What's that about?  You're tired of me.  Oh, is that funny?  The fans that showed up that were sitting in the fishbowl, like, I don't know where they  got them from, but they were like four...  Probably from a bus stop.  Yeah, four overweight women with physical disabilities, like they had crutches and stuff like this.  Like, they were not used to hearing somebody claim that...  This brand of humor?  Yeah, that guacamole had come from somebody's grandmother's vagina.  Dead grandmother, yes.  People want to know why you speak much clearer on Covino and Rich.  I don't know.  Do we intimidate you or something? 
[00:20:30]  I don't know.  Little.  Little.  It's the afternoon.  You can hear the confidence.  It's the afternoon, you're right.  Yeah.  All right.  When someone fires at me, I'm like, all right, I'll fire back.  Roland comments on Chef Doug.  Who's Chef Doug?  Well, Chef Doug is, of course, the chef that's representing the listeners of Covino and Rich.  Oh, okay.  All right.  The listeners have to have their own guac, because if Chef Doug wins, all the listeners  win.  Right.  Chef Doug is a bag of jigsaw. 
[00:21:00]  Roland had similar sentiments.  Oh, really?  We want to come over here with Chef Doug.  Chef Doug, who you said everybody hates.  Yeah.  He might not have support here.  I got a text message.  But everyone...  Chef Doug's mom said he's an ass.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Everyone listening is rooting for Chef Doug, because he's playing on behalf of all the  listeners.  Yeah.  I just prayed.  Jesus hates him, too.  Okay.  Jesus hates Doug.  All right.  Well, those guys are having a good time with it.  Good for them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Um, so then what happens?  Because I see the next clip. 
[00:21:30]  Well, uh...  Between, um, Chef Doug and, uh, the winners announced.  Yeah, we had to cut out a lot of stuff, because then Camino and Rich ask, uh, Mexican trivia  questions.  Right.  While everybody samples the different guacs and votes.  For 20 minutes, they just ate guacamole.  Who are the judges?  Every employee who wants to stop by.  Oh, and they get a little, uh, little sheet?  Yeah, and they write down, they just write down, like, they number the guacs.  Right.  Blind taste test.  My favorite was five.  Put a five in the sombrero. 
[00:22:00]  Oh.  And that's the, that's the vote.  And then they go through and they read off all, every number on the air.  One.  Oh, Jesus.  One.  How many people came through, you think?  Uh, probably like 25-ish.  A lot of them came through.  Yeah, something like that.  Um...  Did the guacs all taste the same?  I need to know.  I didn't taste it.  I didn't try to tell people the guacamole.  Yeah, we just figured out which one was wrong and voted for that one.  Right.  Um...  Guacamole.  But, yeah, so then all the votes are tallied.  They do a big tease. 
[00:22:30]  They go to break and say, the winner will be announced right after this.  Oh.  Okay.  And then, uh...  A little tease, a little tease.  You need a little drama if you're having a contest.  I get it.  It works.  All right.  All right.  And then they announce the winner.  Someone's saying you had tequila confidence.  Did you have a little drink?  Yeah.  Hey, hang it there.  Uh, shit.  Todd in Jersey Delta.  Thank you, Todd.  That's funny. 
[00:23:00]  All right, here's the winner being announced on the Guac Off on the Covino and Rich Show from yesterday.  Who's excited to find out who won the Guac Off?  Yeah!  Wow.  All right.  It's between Jose and Roland.  Oh, shit.  It's between Jose and Roland.  Two brown guys.  Yeah.  And the vote came down to one.  No!  Oh!  The winner won by one vote.  Oh, my God! 
[00:23:30]  Can I do the honors?  Please do.  I'm so nervous right now.  Wow!  The winner, a new Guac Off on the Covino and Rich Show!  Yes!  Yes!  Roland won.  Yeah, he did.  Thank you.  Do you believe in miracles?  Do you believe in miracles?  Jose brought all his friends.  He brought the hat.  He brought the apron.  He couldn't get it done.  Smart brought his entire family.  He brought his vet. 
[00:24:00]  He couldn't get it done.  Now, now.  Roland.  Roland is the champion of the world.  Wow!  With store-bought guacamole.  And he hoists the golden mocahenton.  Now, Roland, you better hoist that and hold that with pride, my friend.  Do you have any final words?  Yeah, nice try, Jose.  Adios, muchachitos.  Oh, my God!  Valles con huevos. 
[00:24:30]  Wow!  Valles con huevos.  Go with balls.  Go with balls.  That doesn't really...  I like how Roland's so scared to get fired, but he's not scared to go on another radio show  and celebrate...  I get this from your grandmother's box.  Right.  It's a lovely contest.  So, Roland wins.  Roland won.  The guac-off.  The guac-off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The ninth annual.  Yeah, from LV's.  With fucking...  Yeah, with pretty much the shit we didn't eat.  Yeah.  Here.  I mean, it was... 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  No, we ate it.  It was delicious.  No, well, we didn't eat the whole thing.  It was two guac-off.  Like, with leftovers, he just...  It was the leftovers, really, yeah.  With our leftovers.  Two, two, one.  Wow.  Damn, okay.  What a controversy.  Then we find out the winning vote was cast by someone.  There was more controversy because the last vote...  The last vote to put Roland over the top.  So, how did they find this out?  Because he walked in.  He walked in and announced.  What an idiot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is he here?  I don't know.  Probably. 
[00:25:30]  There's a twist in this, and the guy's walking out of the room.  Dennis, Dennis, stay where you are.  Oh, no.  Because the guac-off was tied, and Dennis was the last vote.  What?  And Dennis voted for Roland.  So, it all came down to Dennis.  Falcone, Falcone!  Wait, hold on.  Are you saying conspiracy?  They do it through and through, man.  They hang out together all the time.  Is there foul play?  No.  No, of course not.  Falcone, Falcone, Falcone, Falcone, Falcone, Falcone.  Oh, Falcone, Falcone. 
[00:26:00]  Jose makes great excuses.  Roland makes great guacamole.  Wow.  That's something.  Wow.  I came in.  I tasted it.  I voted.  Boom.  Hold on, Dennis.  Tell us why.  He's as good as they come.  Tell us why you voted for number, what was that, number two?  I just like the taste of it.  Four.  Oh, number four.  I just like the taste of it.  The consistency.  When I rolled it around in my mouth.  You don't eat spicy stuff, dude.  You don't eat spicy.  Oh, man.  So, why is that controversial? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Well, because they were saying that maybe he was tipped off as to whose guacamole was whose.  Yeah, I yelled, hey, Dennis, look for.  Oh.  And so they said, oh, this is controversy, but even though, I mean, Jose walked in with  15 people, so.  I don't know, man.  Well, we got the final clip here.  Well, the final clip, apparently, people got big mouths.  Oh.  Because it was just too much fun going on.  Uh-huh.  And somebody had to end the fun. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, okay.  Oh, what's up, what's up, Spot?  I just heard some info.  Okay.  Oh, boy, what's this?  Controversy?  There's some controversy.  How do you figure?  And as producer and former champion, I think I might need to let this out on the air.  Why?  What happened?  I heard a rumor, and this needs to be investigated, and maybe the golden loco hete needs to be  put on hold for a little bit.  Wait, wait, hold on.  What happened?  I heard that our new guac-off champion had a chef make his guac. 
[00:27:30]  Is this true?  Well.  Oh.  Oh.  So.  Oh.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  To be fair.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  As holder of the current holder of the golden loco hete, I revoked the title.  No.  No.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  It's a riot.  Oh, God.  This is crazy.  Craziness.  Pure mayhem.  Well, they just kick a kitten, right?  You heard a rumor like Banana Rabbis. 
[00:28:00]  No.  That's not true.  He's laughing.  I'm going to play poker with this guy.  I got people at the Food Network.  What's up?  You phoned it, Roland.  Yeah, because I wanted to go home.  I had enough of their stupidity.  I'm tired.  I've been here for an extra three hours.  I'm done.  Oh, man.  Take or go to Mocha Hete.  So who ratted you out?  Who ratted him out, Sam?  That's what we're trying to figure out.  Oh, man.  It wasn't anybody associated with this show, but there were people in that room that knew. 
[00:28:30]  And we thought they were cool, but they're obviously not.  They made it work.  They made the guac off work, by the way.  That sounded like fun.  Well, it was because of what we did.  Oh.  All right.  Fair enough.  I mean, Kenny, comment.  Yes, Kenny.  First of all, we did not sabotage.  We enhanced their guac off.  True.  Okay.  That's number one.  And you made your own guac, technically, because you took all the leftovers and mixed  them up into a super guac.  That was my argument.  Super guac.  Super guac. 
[00:29:00]  I want to see the written rules, because we've got to appeal that decision.  Appealing the decision.  But, more importantly, we've got to find out who the rat is.  Yes.  We don't like rats.  No.  Are we going to find out who the rat was?  Well, I've been told something.  Uh-oh.  That I'm going to confirm.  What have you been told?  You have theories?  Yeah.  Suspects?  Yes.  Good.  Yeah.  Why don't you tell me what really happened? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, tell us now, because we are pretty much bored with the guac thing.  We're ready to move on.  Yes.  Let's wrap it up all nice right here, so we can move on to other things.  I'm going to sit him down.  I'm going to give him a shot.  You're going to interrogate him?  No, a shot of liquor.  Oh.  And I'm going to make him tell me, was it to tell you or Bratzini?  Bratzini.  But, I heard it's a person.  I heard a person's name. 
[00:30:00]  I'm not going to mention it, but if it's true, this person does not like the show.  Are they on our staff?  Oh.  They do work here, yes.  Not on the show staff?  No.  They work.  Oh, boy.  They work for this company, and they do not like the show.  Tim Sabian.  Yeah.  Scott Greenstein.  Who?  I'm not saying it on the air.  Because you've got to get to the bottom of it.  Wow.  Kenny really is taking this investigation.  How do you know they don't like our series?  Because there's been incidents.  What, do they have no funny bone?  Right? 
[00:30:30]  Really?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Write the name down.  There'd be that Tommy at first.  Will we know the name or no?  Yeah, you'll know.  Write the name down.  I won't say anything.  I don't want to get you in trouble.  That'll probably be some HR issue.  Who knows?  This person doesn't like the show.  Might have...  Howard?  I can't read it.  Might have...  Might have tipped him off.  That's not fun. 
[00:31:00]  Yuck.  So you think so?  Well...  Gonna take the phone book into the interrogation room?  Just beat the body, the face.  You don't want to leave bruises.  That person's trouble.  Oh.  What?  Capital T.  That's who I've heard so far.  All right.  Anyone else watch the fun fly out the window?  Right?  Jesus, what happened?  I'm gonna take my guacamole. 
[00:31:30]  Right?  It was all fun.  I'm gonna take my guacamole.  The one was a complete ass.  The Camino Rich thing, and it kind of worked.  It was fun to listen to.  Yeah.  You can't sit that person down, though, and question...  Oh, no.  I'm just kidding.  Oh, you're joking.  I'm just kidding what they did in The Godfather.  Oh, I think I'm serious.  All right, well, there you have it.  Roland, great job, Sam.  Great job.  That was good.  They had delicious...  Infiltrating their guac off.  Yeah, our...  Making it something very special.  Our goal is to make it so that SiriusXM bans all shows from having open-door policies. 
[00:32:00]  Of course.  Because this is the second show in a row that's had an open-door policy that we've infiltrated.  Have we been back on the other show?  Since?  No, I was actually...  I talked to Taylor last week.  Right.  Uh, she said, uh, she is never allowed to have an open-door policy again.  Wow.  They're...  Ugh, God.  What dumb radio shows.  It's really stupid.  Yeah, that spontaneity really makes radio boring.  Those are the days that really get people talking and maybe even, you know, grabbing some new listeners 
[00:32:30]  when also you're tuning in your show and they're doing something crazy and different.  And new people are going to listen to Covino and Rich today.  Mm-hmm.  100%.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  All right, we'll take a break.  Uh, we have a Lady Di Marion update.  Oh, boy.  We'll try to make that quick.  We got Seth Rogen coming in.  He's promoting Neighbors.  A movie me and Roland saw.  Oh.  And I absolutely enjoyed it.  Oh.  It wasn't your typical, uh, Hollywood comedy with some dumb fucking message they gotta shove  down your throat in between jokes.  I like a message in a comedy. 
[00:33:00]  Gosh.  I like a good message.  Something with a little heart.  I like something with a little heart.  Yeah.  This is more like Animal House and Caddyshack, those type of movies.  They didn't need a fucking message.  Here's a bunch of jokes, some, uh, some edgy shit, and, uh, and let's roll the credits.  We don't need to fucking, in the end, they got together and fell in love, even though at  the beginning of the movie it looked impossible.  Do you think that Adam Sandler movie where they go to Africa together?  Oh, there'd be a major message in that.  You think at the end it's gonna be like, wow, they realize they do love each other. 
[00:33:30]  How great would it be if that movie ended with her getting her clit cut off and then him  marrying her anyway?  Yeah.  That's how it ends.  Her have a bandage in her lap.  Why can't Hollywood do that?  It would be such a great ending.  A ridiculous ending to these comedies.  Maybe because there's millions of dollars at stake.  I guess they, somewhere, they've figured out the formula works.  Oh, yeah.  Because why else would they continue to do that? 
[00:34:00]  But there is an audience out there that just wants to fucking laugh and they don't need,  you know, that shit shoved, uh, in their face.  Sure.  And Neighbors gives you that.  God damn it.  Nice.  And we'll talk to Seth in about a half hour or so.  Stay there.  Nice.  Thank you, Travis.  Ah, Ticketmaster was 20 years ago today, huh? 
[00:34:30]  With Pearl Jam.  That's a quick 20.  That's what you pick.  They kind of lost that one in the end, right?  Kind of.  Did they start doing Ticketmaster when they didn't want to?  I would assume so.  They did a tour without Ticketmaster.  And not a lot of other bands got on board.  And then they just, you know, eventually went back.  Yeah, that's a big one.  You're fighting a tough battle.  You're fighting a tough battle.  That's a big one to take on.  They're the guys. 
[00:35:00]  Ah.  Good man on campus.  Got a Cronut update.  Because I know the people like the Cronut updates, too.  Oh, they love them.  Ah, just, uh, I don't know, just Johnny E.  It looks like on Twitter.  Japan's number one donut chain has started mass producing its own version of Dominic's Cronuts.  Yeah.  The number one donut chain.  What is the donut chain there?  I'm not going to wank it.  What did I say?  Cronut.  It looks like it's Mr. If I know my Japanese.  Mr. Happy.  Let's see.  Mr. Donut.  Mr. Donut looks like. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, I think that's, uh, I think that's what it is.  And they now have a Cronut.  And, um, Dominic was supposed to be on our show, I think, this week.  Oh, but why?  Why?  Is there a problem again?  His wife's still a little nervous.  Enough with this guy.  Look, enough.  I'm with Jimmy now.  Enough.  Enough.  Enough.  We were so much nicer to that when he was getting mice in his fucking thing.  We're the only ones that really said nice shit about him.  Nice shit.  He's on, you turn on the TV, he's on every one of these goddamn news shows. 
[00:36:00]  Enough with this fucking guy already and the food shit.  Who cares?  The only reason I brought the Cronut update to the show today was for that reaction.  I don't care if it comes on or not, but we were actually nice to him when he was in.  We've never said anything bad about him or his goddamn Cronut.  We have a funny bit.  We do.  We joke.  We bust Roland's balls about it.  We know that his Cronut is better.  Right.  And, all right, his wife's a little nervous.  I get it.  Right.  But then once it's explained, like, ah, he still doesn't.  Goodbye.  Enough.  Jenny Hutt. 
[00:36:30]  He did her show.  He did Jenny Hutt's show.  Really?  Enough.  Enough.  Enough.  We talked to.  They're fucking kowtowing to people that make donuts.  This is why I brought.  Fuck.  Exactly.  This is why I brought it up.  It's ridiculous.  This is why I brought it up.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I am truly sick.  I know it.  I do know it.  Because, again, give them fuck.  I knew I would get that reaction out of you. 
[00:37:00]  Fuck them, then.  Exactly.  Yeah, you want to.  Come on.  I think Roland would be okay with me reading the text.  Uh-huh.  It says, Dominic's wife is still worried.  I tried everything to calm her down.  I think if you sent an email, it would help.  Never.  Are you kidding me?  Enough already.  No.  Begging the donut guy to come on?  Absolutely not.  Here comes Roland.  No.  We've been really, really nice.  We have our limits.  Yeah.  Right. 
[00:37:30]  We were nice to the guy when he came in.  We weren't a dick.  We weren't dicks to him.  No.  He comes on with Hugh Jackman.  Everybody was nice to him.  Right.  Interrupts our Hugh Jackman interview.  Well, that was a biggie.  Hugh Jackman taking a bite out of the cronut for him.  Yeah, exactly.  There's nothing for us.  Nothing.  Now, Roland, take a deep breath.  No, no, no.  I mean, no, if I sent that, he's picking a date.  Okay.  Why didn't you give me that update?  Because you never answered me, so I said, why do I even bother sending it again?  So I was like, whatever. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Touche on that.  Wait, let me see if I didn't answer you.  No.  I didn't know what to say to that.  Sounds like why bother.  I meant to tell you about it.  Oh, I'm the asshole, I see.  Isolate that.  He went to the James Beard Awards last night, and he won for the best pastry chef in the  nation.  He's got a...  Whoop-dee-doo.  Him and his wife got a...  They have to understand the show.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  His wife called back...  We are huge supporters of him. 
[00:38:30]  His wife called back.  She said, everything's fine.  And she said, we're just nervous about the awards, and she goes, we'll pick a date and  let's stop by.  In the end, you know, we support him.  There might be a few little jokes, but I think our audience certainly sees through that in  the end.  Yeah.  It's like guys ball-busting each other.  He goes, okay, okay, okay.  And then that was it.  I might be texting, but I was like, eh, nobody's going to listen to me.  That's pretty...  You've been nervous.  The best of the nation at anything is pretty good.  Yeah.  It's a James Beard Award, so that's like the Oscars for food. 
[00:39:00]  Who's James Beard?  It's a legendary food guy.  He's like the Oscars for him, so...  Wait, he's...  What is...  Oh, no, it's Peter Beard's a photographer.  What?  It's like the Oscars of food.  No, I know.  I don't...  So what?  Everyone comes to town.  Is it in New York?  Yeah.  And they all come to town, and then they give out awards?  Yeah, the James Beard Award.  What kind of awards, though?  It's like a...  They can't have just one award, because then you don't have a good award show.  What does it look like?  Pork chop?  You have like a stand...  Yeah.  Best restaurant, chef, and he went for a pastry chef.  Wow.  Good for him. 
[00:39:30]  So...  That means he might make 22 cronuts today.  Don't get crazy.  How many does he make a day, really?  I believe right now he's up to 300.  But it's like 24-7, though, his kitchen.  Wow.  Oh, that looks prestigious.  Oh, look at that.  Uncle Fester's on it.  Oh, yes.  I see.  All right.  I'll be back.  I have to go get Seth his food.  He's here already?  He's on his way.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, as soon as he gets here, we'll get him on, all right?  Bring him in. 
[00:40:00]  Bring SR in.  I like to abbreviate.  Can we get the Lady and I updates, or how does that work out?  And do we have the clip of Marion?  Yeah, we got the clip in there.  So, what happened?  Well, we were playing clips of Di on the pre-show this morning.  Right.  Did you play the ending of yesterday's show, which we got rave reviews on?  A hundred percent.  All of it.  The whole thing?  It was three minutes of buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.  Yeah, the question was raised, would anybody who's not on crack listen, be on hold, and then 
[00:40:30]  contribute by adding her own buh-buh-buh-buh-buh?  Right.  Yes.  We don't know if she's still doing crack, by the way.  No, we're trying to discover that.  I think she is.  But I have no idea in the end.  I assume she is.  She's lying about when she stopped.  It's three years.  It's two years.  It's what?  We got her down to a year for a while there?  It went three, one, and then two.  Oh, right.  We're back up to two.  Gotcha.  So, then what happened?  Well, then Marion called in, because apparently she listened to the replay of yesterday's 
[00:41:00]  show, and was just disgusted with her friend Dye.  She certainly is.  Disgusted.  Did she bring her tough guy attitude?  Oh, yeah.  She had a lot of chutzpah in the call.  I hope so.  Did she?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Let's hear Marion on the pre-show.  You know, I'm going to tell you something right now.  Bill called me, right?  And right after I guess she talked to you, Bill called me, and I called him back.  And she shit all over herself.  Jesus Christ.  What do you mean she shit all over herself? 
[00:41:30]  I don't know.  Bill called me and left this message on my cell phone.  And I'm like, what's the matter?  Since Diane was sitting there waiting to talk to you, she had to go to the bathroom, and  she couldn't hold it, and she peed all over herself.  Oh, my.  Why didn't she go to the bathroom?  There's a bathroom in her apartment.  She's in her apartment.  Because she's gross, okay?  She's getting to be too gross.  And you know what?  I don't even want to talk to her anymore.  Because it's like every time I talk to her, something else is happening with her. 
[00:42:00]  Marion, what can we do to help this woman?  Nothing.  Sam, let it go.  She is out of control.  She is ridiculous.  And you know something?  She is going to die of cirrhosis of the liver.  Jesus Christ.  Well, Marion, thank you for the update.  I'm sure we'll get into it on O&A today.  Can I see how awful that phone call must have been between her and Bill?  What a terrible fucking call.  Oh, just both of them going back and forth.  I swear to tell her, let me tell you, Bill.  Just interrupting each other with what they both making it about themselves. 
[00:42:30]  I should have won't stop.  I should tell her.  If you like to call, let me tell me if you need to stop.  Two idiots trying to fucking talk all over each other about how they both told her.  Got it.  By the way, people also enjoyed the Louis C.K. impression that Jimmy pushed forward.  I've never wanted to be able to do a voice more than I could.  No, it worked how you did it.  That's why it was so funny.  All because the lady died, by the way. 
[00:43:00]  So for the people that have had it with the lady died, I don't know what to tell you.  Some great shit came out of it yesterday.  So she sat there in her room, pissed and shit herself while she was waiting to get on the radio.  Again, out of control.  And then she probably said, you know, I can't go to the bathroom because then they'll hang up on me.  So I'll just shit here.  I think she's one of those type of people.  Right.  Yeah.  Wow.  Is there more to the phone call from Mary?  A little bit.  I'm on O&A today.  But I'm telling you, I won't be an answer to me because I know you guys tried to call me yesterday. 
[00:43:30]  He tried to call me at home when he tried to call my cell phone.  Yeah.  But each guy called me at a bad time because I was, like, working really and doing things.  Do you see how that fucking meaningless meandering she does?  That has.  Here's what that should have been.  I know you guys tried to call me yesterday.  Right.  Ba-ba-bo.  Right.  You tried to call me at home.  You tried to call my cell phone.  But I was working when you tried to call.  Like, you don't have to cover every possible base.  Every scenario.  Yeah, you were calling through the fell tower.  I would have fell tower into my phone when it went to voicemail. 
[00:44:00]  Shut up.  Fucking blathering dunce.  She is.  She is a blathering dunce.  I'm not a fan of nonsense talk.  I can't be bothered by it.  It's endless with her.  Shut up.  I'm a man of few words when I'm not on the radio.  I just can't be bothered with that.  And she just will ramble.  Right.  None of it helps.  Can I hear that part again now that Jimmy broke it down?  But each guy called me at a bad time because I was, like,  working really and doing some things at work. 
[00:44:30]  You've got to get that money.  And, yeah, I have to work.  He's from Waddle.  I mean, I'm not.  I mean, I have to be in Anthony because I know you guys tried to call me yesterday.  He tried to call me at home.  He tried to call my cell phone.  Yeah.  But each guy called me at a bad time because I was, like,  working really and doing some things at work.  You've got to get that money.  And, yeah, I have to work.  I mean, I'm not.  I mean, I sit down all the time.  I'm like, Diana, get your fucking ass out.  Get a goddamn job.  Get some fucking help.  I'm online with Bob Levy sometimes.  And she shit and pissed herself?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I heard she peed herself.  I don't know about shit, but I heard she peed herself. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  Well, Marion, we've got to let Obi and Anthony take over.  Thank you for the call.  Wow.  So there is your update.  Oh, my.  It's just, but it really, it's just incessant blather.  Right.  Oh, my.  If I call me, I was at work.  He was going to call with the phone that rang because I had a bad reception.  Fucking get to it.  So now, I mean, I want to. 
[00:45:30]  But we will call her.  But I want to talk to Lady Di now.  I want to.  I need the details of her shitting herself.  If she just decided to shit herself because she was talking to us or on hold to talk to us.  Yeah.  Why did she piss herself?  But you don't want to call her.  No, no, no.  If it happens naturally, that's fine.  We'll get to it eventually.  The next time she calls.  I mean, she'll call.  Yeah.  Eventually, she'll call and we'll get that update.  Yeah.  All right.  I got to tell you, Donald Sterling put together a hell of a basketball team. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, yeah?  What's going on?  They're continuing to win.  The L.A. Clippers beat Oklahoma yesterday.  They did.  Oklahoma City, 122-105.  In the next round of the playoffs.  So what are they going to now?  What do you mean?  Oh, no.  This is the first game of the new series.  Yeah.  So.  But Sterling knows how to fucking put a team together.  Oh, yeah.  He's loving this.  And Donald Sterling is building a legal team to fight the NBA.  He is not going away quietly.  This is great for him. 
[00:46:30]  He's an old guy.  He's got nothing to do.  He's got a lot of money.  So, of course, you fight it.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Just walk away being humiliated.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, I'm done.  Sure.  And he might actually get somewhere with the legality of the whole thing.  I'm sure this was so rushed that I'm sure if they paw over whatever contracts and things  that you sign as an owner, there are things in there that don't jive with kicking him  out.  Right.  So we'll see. 
[00:47:00]  If he gets a good enough legal team.  Well, I think you get this in a courtroom and they start talking about, you know, wiretapping  and.  Oh, yeah.  You know, recording private conversations.  Right to privacy and, yeah, yeah.  The fact that that's.  There could be a problem there.  That date with Silver said, like, well, you know, it's public now.  Like, you fucking ass.  Even though the guy's an old twat.  Yeah.  And he really is an old twat.  It's hard to defend him.  Absolutely.  But he has the right to private conversations with his kind of sexy girlfriend.  She's just a dunce. 
[00:47:30]  She is.  But man, there's something very attractive about her.  Dunderhead.  She's.  You like her, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  But she's probably a good fuck.  When you're a billionaire and that's the girl you're, you know, if you hook up with, come  on.  She's got to be.  Maybe.  She looks a little bit like a tranny, though.  Well, you know, sorry.  You make my point.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit in the face.  A little bit.  And then your boy Derek Jeter ad.  Oh, yeah.  They're talking about maybe benching him, even though it's his final year. 
[00:48:00]  Crazy.  How bad is he this year?  Not good.  They're saying he's really bad.  Yeah.  I think that injury really fucked him up.  And he didn't want to go out that way.  So he's like, at least let me come back and say goodbye to everybody.  That's pretty much it.  Just, you know, the goodbye tour.  Right.  Yeah.  He's not the Jeter of old.  That's for sure.  Man.  Every team wants him to stay, of course, for this year.  Because that's, on the road, people will sell out every game and go see him play.  Oh, he'll stay.  He'll absolutely stay. 
[00:48:30]  But how much he's going to play, who knows.  Yeah.  The old heart and soul of the Yankees right there.  Yep.  That's going to be a sad one for you guys.  That's a pretty big one.  That's a biggie.  He's been with the organization since when?  Fuck.  He's been with the organization since the mid-90s.  Because I remember hearing about him.  I forget who was playing shortstop.  It was Gallego and those guys.  And I don't remember who used to play the utility shortstop.  But I remember hearing about this kid, Derek Jeter, in the farm system. 
[00:49:00]  Ah, this kid.  Yeah.  I mean, they talked about him a lot.  And there was a few years you'd hear his name brought up.  Yeah.  He was everything they said he was.  The best I've ever had.  You think first round, Hall of Fame?  Oh, God, yeah.  But they'll be that one guy.  They're going to vote for him because, you know, they can't be 100%.  I've got to be different.  Fucking asshole baseball writers.  Right.  Hey, if no one's ever got 100% before.  Dislike, I've got to be different. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  They're just hateable.  Right.  Let's see.  What else?  The SNL writer thing is great.  You went on this one?  What is that?  This is great.  And she's not backing down.  Her name is Leslie Jones.  No waddle doodle?  Hard to read her Twitter name in the paper.  It's so tiny.  Whatever.  Is she an African-American woman?  Oh, yeah, she is.  Right?  She came aboard when they said they didn't have enough African-American women on the show. 
[00:50:00]  I do remember that.  So they got a few writers, and then they got the performer as well.  I think she's a really funny comic, too.  And she did a little Weekend Update.  A Saturday Night Live sketch joking about slavery written by one of the shows recently hired black female writers has ignited an online backlash.  But comedian Leslie Jones, who made her debut Saturday night for a segment on the news show Parody Weekend Update, refused to apologize for her controversial bit, calling her critics self-righteous.  The bit was kind of funny, to be honest with you. 
[00:50:30]  What was it?  Maybe I'm not allowed to say that, because I'm white.  Oh, gee.  The sketch, Number One Slave Draft Pick, opened with Jones discussing People Magazine's choice of Oscar-winning actress Lupita, I don't know how, Nyong'o?  Nyong'o.  Thank you.  As the cover girl for its World's Most Beautiful Issue.  Jones joked about her own lack of love life, but added that in the days of slavery, her sturdy frame would have gotten plenty of attention. 
[00:51:00]  Sturdy frame.  See, I'm single right now, but back in the slave days, I would have never been single.  I'm six feet tall, and I'm strong, she joked.  I mean, look at me.  I'm a mandingo.  I'm just saying that back in the slave days, my love life would have been way better.  Massa would have hooked me up with the best brother on the plantation.  I would be the number one slave draft pick, Jones said.  That is brave, Ressonel, huh?  Damn.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, you got the actual, that's probably better than me fucking trying to, I kind of liked it. 
[00:51:30]  So, she does that bit.  Ebony.com editor Jamila Lemieux, looks like, tweeted her disgust.  This Leslie Jones person is an embarrassment.  I'm so appalled right now.  Huh?  Why?  As additional negative reactions began to pour out, Jones defended her sketch.  If anybody should be offended, it's white folks because it's what they did, she tweeted.  Oh, lighten up.  She was joking, though.  I know. 
[00:52:00]  That was a joke tweet.  Y'all so busy trying to be self-righteous, you miss what the joke really is.  Very sad.  I have to defend myself to black people.  Lemieux wasn't pacified and continued the attack.  Is Lemieux black as well?  I guess so, if it's Ebony, right?  Continued the attack.  So, the Lupita moment had to be counteracted by a black woman acting like a big, loud monkey.  Just wow.  Damn, yo.  She later took to Ebony.com to further berate Jones in an essay saying she minimalized the  brutality experienced by black women during slave days. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, but that's what comedy does.  It doesn't always tell you the exact truth with no exaggeration or minimalizing, or otherwise  it wouldn't be a joke.  Of course.  You can't just sit there and go, yes, slavery sold off children.  Right.  The end.  Right.  We know it's terrible.  Right.  Of course it's terrible.  That's the beauty of trying to make fun of it.  Yes.  The awfulness is obvious.  Yeah, the woman writing the article doesn't even know the basics of comedy.  And by the way, for her to call her act like a monkey, you're using criticism that if 
[00:53:00]  a white guy used it, you'd be all over it, but for some reason you like using that  criticism.  Right.  Fuck this woman.  But Jones continued to fire back and accused her critics of a double standard for female  comics.  Now, I'm betting if Chris Rock or Dave Chappelle did that joke or Jay-Z or Kanye put it in  a rap, they would be called brilliant, she wrote.  Because they all do this type of material, just because it came from a strong black woman  who ain't afraid to be really y'all mad.  Really, really y'all mad. 
[00:53:30]  Okay.  It's because it's from a woman who's not afraid to be real, y'all mad.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, there should have been a comma.  It's one long.  Okay.  SNL officials declined to comment Monday.  Jones was one of the black women hired by SNL recently after a 39-year-old show was criticized  for its lack of racial diversity.  Diversity.  Good for her, though, hanging in there.  You don't see many people hanging in there.  She opened, I think she opened for Chris.  Chris Rock did the Stress Factory recently, just warming up and doing some road dates.  Right.  He goes in and does the club, and he brings really strong acts to go up in front of him. 
[00:54:00]  Right.  Because he wants to make sure the material is strong.  You know, he's a real comedian, man.  He really wants to make sure he's got good stuff.  I love Chris Rock.  And I heard she just fucking murders on stage.  She's got a great presence.  Yeah.  I felt a little, just a little, a little, relax, everyone.  A little Patrice in there.  A little Patrice confidence, you know.  Uh-oh.  Absolutely.  But you tapped out.  Yeah, I kind of tapped out a little bit.  Tapped out a bit.  Eh. 
[00:54:30]  Just went on a little.  I got her point.  That bitch is racist.  Damn.  Why is Corey saying that bitch is racist?  You're a racist.  She's a comedian.  Corey, go ahead.  Yes.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, man.  Well, I mean, even though she's standing up for herself, you know, I listen to you guys  all the time, and I listen to the news all the time, and they're saying how we can't  say nigger and stuff like that, and then she goes on public television and says,  Hey, I don't like working for you white people.  Well, that shit's racist, too.  No, it's, dude, you can't do the same thing that people do that annoys you. 
[00:55:00]  She's just being funny.  Yeah.  Well, I understand that, but if a white guy would have stood up there and said,  Oh, I hate working for you black people.  Well, then why?  Okay, but then be mad at the press.  Don't be mad at her.  She's just a comic.  She's doing what she's supposed to be doing.  The fact people react differently is their problem.  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, I just, you know.  As a white man, I don't care if she made those little stabs at Whitey.  Who cares?  She was hilarious with it.  That's all I care about at the end.  She was also counterbalancing if fucking Massa would have hooked me in the best slave on 
[00:55:30]  the thing bit.  Right.  Anything's okay when you're doing that.  Yeah, I mean, I agree with you guys.  You know, looking after it.  But it's just like up to media and listening to you guys and everybody else, all those pee-pee  craps, getting a little retarded on it.  Oh, boy.  The R word.  If a white guy would have stood up there and said that, you know, Sharpton would have been  all over that shit or, you know.  But in a comedic view, you guys are correct.  No, I mean, your point is well taken. 
[00:56:00]  You're right.  But, you know.  But that's when you've got to be brave and be a white person and say, I don't care if  a black person makes those dumb jokes at Whitey's expense.  It was funny.  Funny's funny.  Funny is funny.  Period.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You got a point.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, Corey.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Let's say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Is Seth here?  So we're going to try to take a break before Seth.  Yeah, no.  We have time to take a break.  Just let us know.  All right, Chris.  Go ahead, buddy. 
[00:56:30]  Hey, guys.  Long time listener.  Chris A.  Hello?  Yeah, go ahead, bud.  Hey, guys.  Did you guys see that video of the kid that kicked the cat?  Yeah, I know we saw that picture.  It's on the front page of our paper here in New York, the Daily News.  And I did not see the video.  I've seen enough on the cover.  I will not search out this video.  It's infuriating.  It's disgusting, man.  Infuriating.  It is disgusting.  Brooklyn punk busted for vile cat attack. 
[00:57:00]  What?  It was a stray cat, as I know it, and he was making believe he was going to feed the stray  cat in front of his buddies or something?  A whole bunch of people?  He bends down, and the little cat comes up to him, and he pets it on the back, and he's  like, hey, hey, hey, hey, and then just wails his fucking foot into the cat and  kicks him, like, 20 feet.  He's disgusting.  That fuckwad.  He should just be shot in the face.  What do you think they should do to this guy?  I just said it.  I know.  Nothing's going to happen to the guy in the end. 
[00:57:30]  He'll be scared for a while, because people will really push some hate toward his way.  Hopefully he'll get his ghetto comeuppance, and during some drug deal in the near future,  someone will put a round in his fucking face, and he'll be found dead, another waste of  life gone.  That would be wonderful.  I would like that.  He wasn't laughing when they brought him into the precinct, by the way.  He was pretty damn scared about the whole thing.  But I don't even know what kind of charge they could...  Animal cruelty. 
[00:58:00]  But what does that give you?  A little probation or something?  A little bit, I guess, huh?  Listen, we've got to go.  We've got a big star who just entered the studio.  A big star.  A huge star.  Well, not huge.  God damn it.  Seth Rogen lost a little weight.  There you go, man.  Thank you, Chris.  You look great.  Thanks, man.  All right.  All right, buddy.  Jimmy looked good.  We'll get back to the cat story later.  That's too depressing.  You saw that?  Fucking Christ.  Why would you do that?  I know, right?  Why would you do that?  That's such a great question. 
[00:58:30]  Why would you do that?  I'm often...  I have a small dog, and every once in a while, I do have like...  I'll be walking down the street, and I'll see what looks like a crazy motherfucker walking  my way, and I do have this vision of someone just kicking my dog one day, and what I would  have to do to them.  Yeah.  I would choke them with the leash, is what I would say.  Of course.  That's a good one.  That's a weapon of choice.  You would have to.  I would choke them down with my effeminate dog leash.  Did you get your food?  I did.  I chowed it down. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, you already did it.  I did, yeah.  It was delicious.  Making sure you were comfortable, man.  Oh, yeah.  What kind of dog?  I have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.  It just sounds lame.  What?  That many words.  It does.  It's a cute dog.  It literally is the...  It looks like a lady from Lady and the Tramp.  Oh, really?  That's adorable.  And it eats spaghetti like that.  Nice.  Pushing the meatballs with its nose.  Do you bring it on planes?  I do bring it on planes, yeah.  Is that a pain in the ass to do?  No, not really.  She just sits there. 
[00:59:30]  She's very...  She's cool.  Very well-behaved dog.  What do you do if she starts barking?  Isn't that just embarrassing?  She never starts barking, like, ever.  She very rarely barks.  Oh, really?  Good dog.  Good dog.  Won't they make you go from the front?  I've heard that they'll take you...  If you're in first and your dog starts acting up, they'll make you go in the back.  Do they really?  Yeah, I've heard of them.  What about the people that sit in the back?  Exactly.  That just shows how shitty it is in the back.  Go back there with them.  Bother those people.  You know, if that plane goes down, that dog isn't even going to know. 
[01:00:00]  Everyone will be horrified, and the dog will just be in a crate going, like, just doing  the same thing right into the ground.  Wouldn't even care.  It's nice being a dog.  Right?  Ignorance is truly bliss.  What most people are thinking is their plane is crashing.  Yes, I wish I was a dog.  Dog's licking his balls as he fucking smashing all the people.  I wonder why all the people are screaming.  There's a great story we've got to do later, or we could do now.  Do it now.  Some woman was having sex in the bathroom of the airplane.  Oh, Jesus.  And she was really... 
[01:00:30]  Did you hear the story on the way in, Tim?  Yeah, I did.  I don't understand these people.  She was being really loud.  Right.  And people were annoyed by that.  Yeah.  I love hearing a woman moaning.  Maybe they didn't think it was sex, though.  Maybe they thought she was having a little trouble in the bathroom.  No, they all knew it was sex, and people were bothered enough where they started complaining,  and then the stewardess had to knock on the door and try to calm her down.  Jealous busybodies.  But I guess she was moaning really loud.  They send you to the back of the plane, Jealous.  Yeah, fucking coach.  Go fuck on those people.  Would you be annoyed by that? 
[01:01:00]  I would not...  My parents were...  It depends who was with me.  The surroundings.  It could be incredibly uncomfortable.  Especially if it was your parents, Tim.  Yeah, exactly.  That I'd be cool with.  I appreciate that.  Oh, now I'm hearing from Travis.  Her parents were on the flight.  The fuck...  The person's fucking parents were on the flight.  Is that true, Travis?  And it was apparently...  The guy was apparently a stranger.  Oh, that's...  Wow.  That girl hates her parents.  Wow.  That's what happened there.  So she goes in the bathroom knowing her parents are on the plane and then still is really loud? 
[01:01:30]  With a stranger.  That's fucked.  There's a story there.  She must have wanted them to hear.  Yeah, that didn't...  That doesn't just organically happen.  Yeah.  That girl goes on that plane thinking,  I'm going to fuck someone and piss off my parents.  What a lottery that is.  She's mad that Daddy blew her off, so...  She's kidding.  Yeah.  And who's that guy that spots a chick with her parents and he's like,  I'm going to...  And still tries to fuck her.  I'm going to fuck her on a toilet in the sky.  There's several obstacles in my way here, but I can work around all of them. 
[01:02:00]  A, I'm on an airplane.  Me, her parents are here.  Yeah, I don't know her.  See, she seems loud.  How old was she, Travis?  21 or something like that, right?  Early 20s.  Christ, yes.  The guy, I guess, was sitting next to her and they started fooling around in the seat  and then they went to the bathroom.  Was it a nighttime flight?  I don't know.  Was it United?  Was it United?  United?  That takes balls to do, man.  Yeah.  To get up and then try to get into a bathroom with a girl and I don't know. 
[01:02:30]  I don't know how you pull that off.  People get weird on airplanes.  Yeah.  Once in a while, you see someone on an airplane and you're like...  That girl would jerk off someone right now.  It's usually the girl I'm flying with.  It's not me.  I think that everywhere I go.  I wonder if there's a possibility of death, people lose inhibitions.  I think that's what it is.  It's like how shitty movies seem better on airplanes.  I think shitty people to fuck seem more likely to be not that bad to fuck on an airplane.  Shitty movies do. 
[01:03:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  They're way better on a plane.  The Jobs Ashton Kutcher movie on a plane a few days ago.  I was like, this isn't that fucking bad.  It should win an Oscar, god damn it.  It's like, good impression.  But I think that's also why those people were laughing at that stewardess that was doing  a little stand-up act in the front.  Right.  Exactly.  Again, you're nervous.  You're just finding anything you can laugh at.  It's a release.  To be distracted.  Yeah, the fact that you're completely out of control of your own existence.  I get so annoyed when that shit...  Whenever they try to be funny on the plane, or like I saw a video yesterday of the cast 
[01:03:30]  of The Lion King singing on an airplane, I was like, I fucking hate that.  I was like, shut the fuck up.  People try to sleep on this fucking thing.  Like, I think I'm going to die.  And the last thing I need is like 30 musical theater assholes fucking singing to me for no  reason.  It sounds like a nightmare.  Do you have that right?  Years ago, when Heather Mills was on Dancing with the Stars, whatever she was on, it was  one of my favorite stories, because she's such a hated woman.  And there was a big delay on like a Virgin or British Airways, and they said, as a treat, 
[01:04:00]  because she was on with her dance partner, we're going to have someone dance for you.  And then she gets up and dances with her dance partner on the plane, and everybody was  already annoyed, and they said it was just dead silence.  Nobody applauded.  Nobody gave her anything.  Oh, man.  Her and her fucking bum gam.  She put her leg in the overhead and sat back.  How awkward would that be?  Oh, well, I guess that didn't work.  Can I move your backpack? 
[01:04:30]  By the way, it was a virgin flight.  I have to add that.  It was a virgin flight, everybody.  They think that's hilarious in the story, so I want to mention that.  I eat on planes a lot.  Like, I'll eat almost anything, and I think it's the feeling of normalcy in a scary situation.  Yeah, totally.  Yeah.  I just watched the stewardesses, and if they're not panicking, I'm like, oh, okay, all those  dumb noises and bumps are totally normal.  Every time I watch that show, Air Disasters, the stewardess is like, and I went out there  and didn't give a clue that there was a problem. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, thanks.  I was fucking smiling.  Thanks.  You just ruined it.  You ruined my one thing.  Ruins it.  My one fucking thing I had.  I'll be right back.  But then every once in a while, you do see them panic a little bit, and you do see them  sit down and strap themselves in it, and have like 1% of worry on their face, and you're  just like, oh, this is fucking it.  This woman's flying 400 million flights.  Yeah, but this is the one.  She's strapping herself in.  There was some story about turbulence that was so bad, and they said one of the flight attendants 
[01:05:30]  was actually sitting there and crying.  Wow.  I'm like, wow.  How unsafe do you feel with the fucking flight attendants in tears?  They had one out of Philly just the other day, where a guy cracked the overhead and  everything.  Wow.  A lot of people were injured.  A flight attendants?  Everybody.  They're saying really bad turbulence, and they had to turn the plane around.  And me and Ann were talking about it like the pilots would have kept going.  They would have been like, fuck it.  I probably don't care.  They're used to all that.  It's never like in the plane crash due to turbulence.  I heard there was that one that was flying from London to Brazil maybe like six or seven 
[01:06:00]  years ago.  I heard that one was actually turbulence.  Wait.  London to Brazil?  It wasn't.  Maybe the other way around.  It was Brazil to Paris.  Yes, yes.  That's what it was.  That's what it was.  No, that wasn't turbulence.  It wasn't?  No, that was because that was the Airbus.  Thunderstorm or something.  And it was the perfect storm of the water.  Their guidance, whatever it was that tells them their speed.  What's it called?  The altimeters?  The altimeters, but it gets fucked up with water.  Oh, that's it?  It froze up?  It froze over.  Oh, wow.  And it was pilot error because they couldn't tell how fast they were going, so they stalled. 
[01:06:30]  Pilot error.  Whoops.  That was the one, right?  According to flight, that pilot should have been on more cocaine.  Right.  Stay awake.  You want your pilot on cocaine?  Oh, hell yeah.  Stay awake.  If I took anything from that movie.  You want your pilot doing crank off the dashboard like a fucking trucker.  Was he on cocaine, though?  Dashboard.  Like he's got his pack of cigarettes.  Exactly.  Like a little dancing Elvis on the head.  A hula girl.  Shit. 
[01:07:00]  Do this shit.  Fucking Seth, you rule.  Seth Rogen.  I got to say, I saw Neighbors last week.  And a lot of times, they want us to see these movies ahead of time.  I can't be bothered, to be honest with you.  But your movies, I always go.  Thanks.  And it was fucking hilarious.  Thank you.  And the theater was just, they were all in.  That's awesome.  All in, laughing at all the places they're supposed to laugh.  That's great.  And what I liked about the movie is, and we said it earlier, don't fucking holly, no dumb  message by the end of it.  Not really, no. 
[01:07:30]  I hate that with comedies.  The messages?  I mean, tiny shit.  You grow up a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  But it's not like, you know, everyone has to fall in love at the end.  And they weren't sure if they were in love at the beginning of the movie.  It's like, who cares?  Just make me laugh, man.  Yeah, we knew the movie would really live and die on how much the audience was laughing  at any given moment, basically.  Like, I remember saying that very early on in the edit.  Like, when the audience isn't laughing, they're like, fuck this movie.  Like, they just don't, they don't give a shit that much about, you know, like. 
[01:08:00]  Advancing the story.  It's a very, it's not a very elaborate story.  Like, we move next door, we're a family, a frat moves next door, and we fucking hate each  other.  And like, whenever it's not hitting that point really hard, the audience doesn't really care  what's going on that much.  Are you comfortable watching your comedies in front of people?  Like, in the audience, do you like watching it?  Or would you rather watch it in the screening room by yourself?  No, when they do well, it's like, that's what you're looking for.  I mean, like, I started doing stand-up, so like, I really like the sound of tons of people 
[01:08:30]  laughing.  And when you make a movie, it's kind of like, it's like you tell jokes, you work on them,  you finesse them, and then, like, you wait, like, three months, and then you finally  get the laugh.  So, like, when a movie plays really well, and when, like, there are jokes that get those,  like, explosive laughs, then it's really fun to watch in a theater with people.  Just scary.  I went to the Arthur premiere, and there was like, ugh, there was something.  Yeah, no, when it's something like that, then it sucks.  Like, and I've definitely been in and worked on movies that don't play as well as you would 
[01:09:00]  like.  But you guys know that.  I'm sorry.  You guys know that ahead of time, though.  You generally do.  If a movie's not working.  Yes, and we try to fix it, like, if it isn't, but not everyone does.  Like The Makers of Arthur, for example.  Yeah, it's tough, though.  Like, it's really hard to make an audience full of people laughing.  You've had a really good run.  We've talked to guys where they go, yeah, I knew this movie was going to suck, and there  was nothing I could do about it, and I still had to put a smile on my face and promote  it, you know?  I've done that a few times.  I try not.  I mean, there's some movies I've learned in the past, even the movies that I hate the 
[01:09:30]  most other people still come up to me on the street and really like them, so it's  like, guilt trip is not my favorite movie I've ever been in, by any means.  When I watch it, it doesn't, like, make me laugh really, really, really.  There's a few parts that are funny, but I try to put myself in a position where, like,  I'll promote a movie much more if I really like it, basically, so I don't have to lie  to people.  Basically, my goal. 
[01:10:00]  It's hard when you have to lie about it.  Oh, man.  No doubt.  But Neighbors is a good old-fashioned frat movie, man, period.  It is, yeah.  It really is.  Yeah, those old movies where it's just funny all the way through.  A lot of comedies these days, they're very funny at the beginning, and then this weird  character story development thing happens where the funny is ripped right out of the  movie, and they try to make some kind of a poignant drama out of it, and it just...  People have a hard time, like, bouncing that stuff. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  And, yeah, it's hard to make a good comedy.  Well, the only comedies we get, in general, are rom-coms.  Yeah.  Oh, the old rom-coms.  I mean, the old-school ones, like Neighbors is making a bit of a comeback, thank God,  finally.  Yeah.  And you've got a lot of nudity in the film.  We do.  That'll sell the flick.  We do.  Both male and female.  Oh, great.  There was a moment where there were so many dicks in the movie, we were like, we've got  to put in, like, three boobs for every dick, at least.  Like, we owe, like, nine tits to this movie. 
[01:11:00]  There's a lot of dick shots.  And dildos.  Yeah, there's quite a bit of dildos.  The frontal male nudity doesn't seem to, like, when did that start becoming accepted?  I'll tell you, it was, uh, Jason Siegel did it in, uh, Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  That was, like, the first one where I was, like, I remember seeing it and being like,  oh, shit, now I've got to show my dick.  It's like when athletes, like, saw a guy dunk for the first time, probably they were all 
[01:11:30]  like, fuck, like, that's what we've got to do to score now?  That's how I felt.  I was like, oh, shit, I've got to show my dick to get last down.  So, the bar has been raced.  Well, Seth is nude in this movie a couple times, so.  Oh, yeah, he's nude.  You don't see my dick, but I'm, uh, you almost do.  Well, you're having sex on the couch.  I think we can give that one away.  Yeah, exactly.  But how hard was it to film that scene?  It's not that bad.  Whenever, like, the sex scene is funny, it's not that bad.  You're all good. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, like, I've done one or two movies where, like, the sex scene's actually supposed  to be, like, intimate and passionate, and, like, that's fucking gross.  And that's actually awkward, and, like, you feel really bizarre as that.  But how do you walk on set?  Are you, like, walking?  They give you a robe, and you're wearing your thing, and literally, it's like a porto movie.  Like, they're like, okay, like, just robe, and then you take your shit off, and you try  to get in your position.  Do you cover up your junk, knowing that you're not really filming that?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, you know, it's always a fine balance, because you don't want to seem too 
[01:12:30]  ashamed of yourself, but at the same time, you don't want to be too explicit and make  people uncomfortable.  Right.  So I'll, like, casually cover myself up.  You don't want to scramble.  Right.  You know.  Yeah, you don't want to make it look like you're trying.  You just got caught jerking off or something like that.  What's the sock they put on a guy?  How do they hold your dick down?  I know there's something to tell you.  It's like a cock sock.  It's, uh, and it doesn't, like, at best, it holds, like, half a dick in a ball.  Like, it's not, it's not, it doesn't quite do what you would hope it would. 
[01:13:00]  No, it does.  If it doesn't hold all of it, it does exactly what you want it to do.  And it's got to fall off during filming.  Yeah, there's always overflow.  Like, you will cut, and I'll look down, and it's just like, oh, like, one of my balls  is just fully hanging out.  We've all tried the sock thing, and that damn thing will just not stay on.  No, it doesn't work.  It doesn't really stay on.  It's having little straps that, like, kind of go along.  And they'll, like, digitally remove the straps.  Oh, really?  Okay.  There's some movie magic that happens.  Wow.  That is magic.  It's literal magic.  So the actresses are having kind of, like, a shaft and ball banged against them while 
[01:13:30]  they're falling around like that?  You're kind of dry-humping them with, like, a little, uh, yeah.  I remember, like, one of the first times, like, when we filmed Knocked Up, I remember  thinking, like, if I was in high school, I would consider this sexy.  No shit.  I heard they're like, yeah, like, if I was 17, I'd be really pregnant.  I'm talking to my friends about what is happening right now.  I got blue balls right now, god damn it.  It was sex, man.  Yeah, yeah.  That was hardcore sex when you were a teenager.  We had a few teenagers.  A young teenager, right? 
[01:14:00]  It was hardcore sex.  It really was.  You didn't even care about the chafing for the next fucking week.  No, not at all.  Just, like, all raw, right?  Yeah, that was the goal.  Yeah.  I'd dry-hump the shit out of somebody.  Are you worried about getting a rod in those situations, or is there a part of you that  wants to, just to show her?  Yeah.  Just to show her?  I don't know how I feel about that.  I remember reading a quote, like, from Sean Connery, where he was, you know, not talking  about beating up women, but he was talking about making love to them on movies, and he 
[01:14:30]  said, like, he said, like, I say to a woman, I'm sorry if I get aroused, and I'm sorry if  I don't get aroused, and I was not like, that's a smooth thing that only Sean Connery  can say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That wouldn't fly with me.  No.  Sorry if I get a boner, and I'm sorry if I don't get a boner.  They'd just be like, how about you don't get a fucking boner?  He said if they melted with his charm.  And then I'd choke them.  A little backhand action.  Exactly.  Have you ever gotten excited doing one of those? 
[01:15:00]  Never really, no.  Not, like, fully.  There's a scene in Knocked Up where me and Paul Rudd are at a strip club, and we kind of built  a strip club on set, and then over the years we've learned that if you hire porn stars to  play, like, strippers and people being naked, it's so much better than hiring, like, an actress  who wants to be a stripper, because to an actress, like, that's her worst day of the  week, and to a porn star, that's her best day of the week.  The fact that she's not getting, like, three dicks in her ass is like, to them, this is 
[01:15:30]  like a fucking vacation job, you know?  And they're thrilled, they're in a good mood, they're not awkward about it, but, like, for  an actress who wants to be a serious actress, it's, like, humiliating to play a stripper.  But a porn star, that's, like, your segue into the mainstream.  So we got to pick our porn stars, like, I remember at the time, like, I was into Nautica  Thorne, so I was like, oh, let's get her, and Paul Rudd, I can't remember who he picked,  but that, and then we literally sat there, I got lap dances for, like, three and a half 
[01:16:00]  hours straight.  And I remember me and Paul beforehand talking about it, being like, it's going to be kind  of awkward, it's going to be weird, like, getting lap dances in front of all these people,  and then, like, 30 seconds into it, we turned to each other, we're like, this is not awkward  at all, this is the greatest fucking thing that's ever been, this is literally just us  getting lap dances for three hours straight.  You should have taken a Cialis and put on silk boxers.  It was wonderful. 
[01:16:30]  What a great point about a porn star, though, like, for them, that's such an easy day at  work.  Oh, we still do it, it's like, it's, I actually was one of the ones who, like, when we made  Zack and Miri make a porno, like, I was a big proponent of Kevin, for, I told Kevin  Smith, like, hire fucking porn stars, like, do not try to get actresses who will do the  stuff that you want these porn stars to do.  Yeah, yeah.  Because, yeah, porn stars, they're down, it's great, like, you don't have to, like, yeah,  with actresses, I mean, rightfully so, it's generally, like, there's a negotiation of how  naked they'll get. 
[01:17:00]  Again, a porn star's happy that she's not getting a watermelon in her ass.  It's like, so I'm just naked?  Yeah, you're just, and you guys are just going to tell jokes around me?  Yeah, that's it.  No one's shitting on me?  No, no one is shitting on me.  And you're paying me?  Yes, that's exactly what's happening.  This is a fucking mutually beneficial situation.  And they probably didn't jump up, like, regular actors would probably jump off your laptop.  Cut!  No, no, they do, because they were all strippers, so they kind of do the stripper thing of,  like, slowly, like, putting, they keep it sexy. 
[01:17:30]  That's great.  Who's Nautica, what's her name?  Nautica Thorne.  Do we know her?  I don't know if I know her.  What's her specialty?  Is she a blowjob queen?  She's Asian.  So, in porn, that's a specialty.  Right, that is a specialty.  And often, I find a lot of Hispanic girls go back and forth between being Asian and Hispanic  in porn, which is amazing, diverse, I don't know what you call that.  Amazing they can do that.  Versatility.  Yeah, exactly.  Versatility. 
[01:18:00]  She's in Latina sluts and me so horny.  Remember Hiya Pasha Lee?  Very versatile.  Do you remember Hiya Pasha Lee from years ago?  She was, like, the first big Asian porn star, I think.  Who?  Hiya Pasha Lee, I think her name was.  No, I remember.  That's going right back.  I remember Asia Carrera was one of the first, like, big Asian porn stars.  Her name was Asia.  Right, right.  Yeah, that's good.  That shows how much she cornered the market.  Yeah, good.  Here we go.  Who I'm, yeah, Asian.  No mistaking this.  That's who I'll go with.  You know Asa Akira, I think is how you say her name?  Yeah, Asa Akira, yeah. 
[01:18:30]  Asa Akira.  Asa Akira, she is fucking hilarious.  She's one of the, she might be the funniest Twitter account.  She is funny.  I've looked at her Twitter every once in a while.  I have to get that.  Yeah.  She does that show with David Cho.  David Cho, his podcast.  Yeah, right.  He just got in trouble for saying how he raped a masseuse or something.  Jesus.  Really?  He did.  He had some shit go down.  Oh, yeah.  I like his art, so I remember, I like, I'll read up on him every once in a while.  For some reason.  He's a maniac, though.  He really doesn't give a fuck.  He's crazy, yeah.  Because he's worth a couple hundred million from that Facebook stock.  He got Facebook stock for painting their walls. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Highest-paid artist in history.  But then there is some rape allegations going around, so.  You want to be careful with that.  Yeah.  You've got to be, right?  There's only so good a painter you can be before that.  Before that matters.  Yes.  I don't know if he's good enough.  You've got to get better.  How often are you on Twitter?  You go on there?  I know every day.  Every once in a while.  I don't tweet every day.  You get shit?  You get shit from people?  I really don't that often. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, man.  And when I do, I will, like, I'll write them back.  You do?  Like, fuck you.  Have you gotten to the point where you just bounce, or you've got to say something every  time?  Uh, no.  I, uh, no.  I don't say something every time.  Yeah, yeah.  But I, uh, I'm a pretty, people aren't that bad to me on Twitter.  People are, I talk shit about, like.  You fucker.  I know.  Yeah, dude.  People just rail against you guys.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  You guys, but radio people have, like, a kind of adversarial relationship.  With their listeners.  That really is true.  You're right. 
[01:20:00]  Why?  Why?  Why us?  I don't know.  It's familiarity breeds contempt to some degree.  Honestly, they feel like they know you really well.  You're in their car with them as they're driving, and eventually they're like, I know these  guys.  Fuck these guys.  On those slow news days, you've got to throw your life out there.  Yeah.  So people know everything about you, and then they just call you asshole.  We should do one radio show a month.  They would love us.  People would like you guys way more.  Oh, God.  They'd love us.  No, but they associate you with all the good and bad times, because you're in the car with  them.  So if they're fighting with their wife, who else are they listening to? 
[01:20:30]  Your voice.  Right.  Yeah, it's true.  And they think we're taking her side, God damn it.  Yes.  Don't worry.  And they're right.  If that's happening right now, open the door and kick her right outside.  Grab one of her tits, and then give her a boot.  Man up already.  Tire you.  I mean, because you guys also, like, have kind of a, you know, rapport is kind of an argumentative  one at times, so I think it'd feel like maybe they feel like, in order to get in on the  action, they've got to be like you guys.  Donny.  Oh, Don.  That's Anthony's sister. 
[01:21:00]  Nice.  She wanted to meet you.  She came in just to meet Seth Rogen.  Ed dressed apart, too.  Yes.  Don all dressed up nice.  Hi there.  All right.  Sit down and shut up.  I've got a gig to plug.  A gig to plug.  Oh, that's right.  Boy, my family loves plugging gigs.  What do you do?  What does she do?  Well, me and my brother and sister are doing a little musical engagement.  Nice.  Patchogue.  Yes.  We're like the little Partridge family.  Ruben Kincaid.  Yeah, I see.  Ruben Kincaid is dead, so. 
[01:21:30]  Someone has to carry it on.  There's nothing worse than when you've mentally committed to Ruben Kincaid and someone starts  saying Partridge Family.  You did it, though.  You clowned through.  You already did.  You have the more specific reference.  Even though it was a millisecond late, you get the points on that one.  But the margin of difficulty was higher on your side.  I hear you're involved in The Room, the movie The Room, something about it.  Yeah, Franco bought. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, great.  One of the guys who made The Room wrote a book about the making of it, Greg Sestero.  And so Franco optioned the book and then asked me and Evan, my producing partner, to help  him produce a movie based on the book.  So it's going to be a movie based on the making of the movie.  Exactly, yeah.  All right, fantastic.  This won't be an expensive movie.  Because that goddamn thing is hilarious.  It's unbelievable. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  I saw it like 10 years ago, I think, for the first time.  Like, right when it came out.  Like, I just moved to L.A.  And there would be billboards for it and ads and stuff like that.  I remember I saw it with Jonah Hill, actually, randomly.  And then, like, we became obsessed with it.  Like, it was the greatest fucking thing I've ever seen.  That awful movie, right?  You watch it and you're just trying to figure out what it is.  Like, was this a goof?  Is this guy serious?  No, he's serious.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, totally, totally serious.  But there's something like, that's what's interesting about, like, as we talk about it and work on 
[01:23:00]  the movie.  Like, you want, it's your instinct to just, like, say, like, fuck this movie.  It's a horrible piece of shit.  Like, why would you do this?  Like, what an idiot.  But what's kind of, what you can't ignore is that, like, there's tons of bad movies that  aren't watchable.  Right.  And that, like, no one watches over and over and over again.  So, like, there is something you kind of have to give credit to because, like, of all the  shitty movies, he made one that, like, people still watch 10 years later, you know?  People love to watch the shittiness of it.  And so, like, there is something, probably, obviously, no, you know, effort of the guy 
[01:23:30]  who made it, but, like, there is something that's oddly brilliant about it in a weird  way, you know?  What is that?  Because, obviously, it was sheer accident that it made shitty in a way that people like  watching shitty.  Yeah, it's bizarre.  What is that?  I don't know.  I don't get it.  And it's like, it's like new shit.  Like, a lot of movies, like, you get the joke 10 minutes in, you're like, I get it.  It sucks.  Right.  This movie's not like that.  No, no.  Like, in 10 minutes, like, after 40 minutes, you're like, it keeps coming up with new ways 
[01:24:00]  to be shitty.  It's constantly, like, reinventing the shitty wheel as the movie goes on.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, it's truly amazing.  Have you talked to the guy yet?  Uh, I met him, uh, in a grocery store one time.  Holy shit.  Wow.  And I talked to him for a little while.  Oh, hi, Seth.  Oh, hi, Seth.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's kind of like a vampire.  He's like a vampire-y vibe.  Does he know it's awful?  Well, what's interesting is he's kind of had to restructure his thoughts on it, I think, 
[01:24:30]  to some degree.  Like, because he wants the acclaim and attention, but all that's associated with somewhat acknowledging  that it sucks shit.  So, like, I think he's kind of in a weird position where he goes to the Q&As and he introduces  the screenings, and I think now he kind of pretends, like, oh, it's a dark comedy or something.  Right, right, yeah.  But it's, like, so clear that he, like, is wounded by, is, like, torn.  Yes.  Which is interesting also. 
[01:25:00]  Like, a guy who has to, like, go around and perpetuate something that he, that's being  received for all the wrong reasons, basically.  The irony is an afterthought.  Like, oh, yeah, that was meant to be ironic.  Right, right, right.  That's meant to be weird.  No, he wanted every scene in that movie to be a statement and something great.  Oh, yeah, he thought it was brilliant.  Yes.  And, like, it's so, but again, that's what's interesting.  Like, I think there's something so honest about it.  Yes.  Like, that's what makes it watchable.  Like, it's, it's so clearly, like, he thought it was so good that, and it's all from him 
[01:25:30]  that you, it's, like, I think that's what it is.  It's very personal in a weird way.  And the art is that somebody can do something so abysmal and look at it and think it's good.  It's, like, the fact that you can look at that and actually think that it was good after  it was done.  Well, yeah, I could imagine.  It's just, I can't get over that.  Watching, like, the dailies from that and being like, yeah, we nailed it.  Right, right.  It's good.  That was perfect.  What is he doing now?  Did you ask him, or does anyone know?  Well, the whole thing is that, like, he has a massive amount of money from, like, a mysterious 
[01:26:00]  source.  And, like, and, and, and, and I don't know if, I don't know if it's ever, like, the book  is, like, the guy talks a lot about how, like, where's the money?  Like, the movie's not a cheap, it's like a $10 million movie or something like that.  It's not a cheap movie.  And so, and he paid for it all himself.  And where'd the money go?  Did he pay $9 million to one actor?  Yeah, exactly.  Because they kept going.  Like, it kept, they kept stopping and starting.  He bought all the equipment himself.  He didn't rent it for the movie house. 
[01:26:30]  He bought the cameras and the stuff.  Like, and, like, it was a very bizarre approach.  But, like, so for whatever, however he's rich, like, he's independently wealthy.  And, and he currently, like, tours with the movie still.  Like, yeah.  He never tried to do another movie or any of that.  Supposedly, he was, like, working on something else.  But I don't think he ever did.  That'd be great if he did, though.  I can't wait to see that.  I was, I did Red Eye with the guy that wrote the book.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  And he, some of his stories about it are just, he tells it very, uh, it's very entertaining. 
[01:27:00]  Does he like how the movie came out?  Not really.  He, uh, he has fun with it now.  With Greg.  Greg.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's, like, who, yeah, like, his character would be the star of the movie.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And, but, yeah, it's crazy.  Like, but he's still friends with Tommy.  Like, they're still good friends.  Oh, they tour it.  They go out on stage.  Yeah, they go out on stage.  Yeah, they go out on stage.  Yeah, yeah.  And packed houses.  And, again, for Greg, it's bizarre, too, because he wanted to be, like, a serious actor.  And then he ends up in that.  Yeah, he ends up in that.  And he kind of, he knows it sucks, though, as it's happening. 
[01:27:30]  Yes.  But he, at the same time, seems to be, like, but it's a movie.  Like, someone's actually, like, making a movie.  What is it about a lawn chair on the roof in one scene where they're sitting in, like,  Yeah, they're sitting on the roof.  A whole lawn chair.  And it's all, like, really bad green screen.  There are roofs in Los Angeles.  Right.  They're not even hard.  They're not hard to have access to.  And then they're throwing that football around, like, two feet away from each other.  Yeah, they play football on the day of their wedding when they're all in tuxedos.  Yeah.  It was great.  It's super.  My favorite thing is the same sex scene is in the movie twice. 
[01:28:00]  Like, they reused the same sex scene very clearly.  Same shots, same everything.  Jesus.  Just replay it again.  Yeah, it's like, they're, like, 40 minutes apart.  It's probably like, Ed Wood was appreciated years later for his awful movies.  And maybe this is one people are like, hey, look, this guy is still here.  Yeah, people talk about it.  It's like a very Ed Wood-ish.  There are a few movies like that.  I remember Blood Feast is a horror movie that was just watched for a goof. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  You just watched it.  The horrible acting, the bad special effects, the echo in the back of everything.  The boom in the shot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The boom in the shot.  People, like, I think one of the things is people like the idea of people whose, like,  ambition way outweighs their talent.  I think there might be something inspiring to people about that.  Where they're just like, this guy didn't care.  Why should I?  Why should I care?  He wanted to make a fucking movie, and he didn't let the fact that he had no idea how 
[01:29:00]  to do it would stop him from doing that, you know?  That's brilliant.  There's something endearing about that.  Yes.  Yeah.  Who's James Franco playing on that?  He might play Tommy Wiseau.  Wow.  I can see that.  Yeah, you can see exactly.  I can see him being a creepy guy like that.  Oh, it's a real movie, not a documentary.  No, yeah.  It's like a movie about the making of it.  That would be fantastic.  It'd be really interesting.  How many years was the room made?  Like 10 years ago.  10 years ago.  I thought it was older.  Okay.  No, yeah.  Maybe a little longer. 
[01:29:30]  No, maybe a little.  All right, but there's green screen, and it couldn't be that old.  No, yeah, no.  It was made in like the late, the early 2000s, I'd say.  Yeah, around then.  Maybe the late 90s, but around then.  Yeah.  What's the deal with Franco painting you nude?  I don't know.  He, um...  You guys got such a great friendship.  I don't even question it anymore, honestly.  It's like if you're friends with someone who's like...  If we weren't famous and your friend did that, you'd just be like,  Oh, that's a funny thing that my friend did, right? 
[01:30:00]  He's, you know, but because it all gets put out there in the world,  I guess it becomes a lot more ridiculous in the public eye.  No shit.  To me, I was just like, Oh, that's funny.  Franco's painting these ridiculous naked pictures of me.  But, yeah.  Then you step back, you're like, Oh, everyone sees it, too.  Yeah, yeah.  But, yeah, he just...  I think he just thinks it's funny.  Of course.  He's bored.  He's just bored.  He continues.  And he uses his brother in, not to bring it back to the movie,  but we should, you know, make sure people know about Neighbors.  Franco's brother's in it. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, Dave.  He does a great job.  Is that his first big role?  He's been in some stuff.  He's in that Now You See Me movie about the magicians,  which I love, personally.  I didn't see.  It's very watchable.  Immensely watchable.  He has smaller stuff, and so he's in this Warm Bodies movie,  a zombie movie that came out last year.  He's actually in Superbad.  He has one line in Superbad.  But I've known him since then, basically.  He's really good.  He's incredibly talented.  Yeah, he's really funny.  And Zach gave you a great performance, too. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, he did a really good job, Gene.  Zach Efron is the head fraternity guy.  He's really good.  Most people don't expect to think he's funny at all.  But he's really, really funny.  What a great classic, like, standoff that is.  Yeah.  The bullying frat guy, and then the, you know,  leave me the fuck alone guy.  The family guy.  Yeah.  Well, it's true, I mean, it's funny, like,  it's like, there was a moment where, like,  you watch movies like Animal House and shit,  and you think, like, man, it's fun to watch that,  but you have to acknowledge, like,  I'm at the age where I would hate those people. 
[01:31:30]  It's fun in a movie, but, like, fuck those kids.  Like, shut the fuck up.  That's so right.  I just want to go to sleep.  Yeah, I want to watch television and go to fucking sleep.  And that's like, I remember having to admit that to myself.  But thinking, like, yeah, that's probably relatable to more people than you would imagine.  More people want those people to shut up than to party with them.  Right.  I got to give away one thing. 
[01:32:00]  The breastfeeding boobs.  Oh, yeah, the milking.  Yeah.  Where the fuck did you get that from?  That actually was a story.  That happened to one of the friends of one of the writers.  There's a scene where, like, apparently, and I had no fucking idea that this happened,  but, like, when a woman's breastfeeding, her breasts fill up with milk,  and you use a pump to get the milk out.  But if the pump, if you don't have access to a pump,  you have to physically squeeze the milk out of the breast.  And, yeah, so one of the writer's friends was coming back from Coachella with his wife, 
[01:32:30]  and they had this happen.  They had their pump broke, and he had to milk her on the side of the road in the car.  And I remember he told us that story, and we're like,  we have to put that in the fucking movie.  They get really tight and engorged, especially when they stop breastfeeding.  Yeah, exactly.  When they have a problem because the milk continues to be produced,  and the women have to literally milk themselves in the shower.  Giant life-giving tits.  What a bitch.  No, my question was where did you get the actual boobs from? 
[01:33:00]  There were prosthetic boobs.  They were made, right?  They were made.  Oh, they look great.  Our effects company.  They look great.  No, they look great.  They look great in a horrific way.  Yeah.  It's literally the guys that do the walking.  Dad made those breasts.  Really?  Yeah, really.  God, they must have made it.  Perfect.  They're like, you know what we do with our craft?  They do all our crap.  They're always making us dicks and butts.  They literally just sent us the dick from This is the End in a box.  It's like a two-foot-long black dick with a little note. 
[01:33:30]  It was like, we found this in front of you.  Oh, that's nice.  I really love This is the End, man.  Thank you so much.  It's an older movie, but that was so much.  That movie was fun.  I remember listening to you guys on the radio, literally driving, and you started talking  about it one day.  And whenever that happens, I get so nervous because I'm like, oh, shit.  They're going to talk shit about me on the radio.  And then instead, you talked about liking it, which was very nice.  Where's Danny McBride these days?  He's taking a little break or something. 
[01:34:00]  We haven't seen him in a minute.  He's filmed a few movies that haven't come out yet.  He's in Cameron Crowe's new movie that is coming out.  And I think he did another movie.  He's one of my favorites, man.  When he appears in This is the End, it's just, he's a rock god.  He's one of the, like, among us, he's like the funniest.  Like, everyone's kind of comedically afraid of Danny McBride.  Really?  He's like the guy that could kick all your asses.  Like, especially, like, I remember in This is the End, like, he showed up a little late.  Like, we started filming, kind of like in the movie. 
[01:34:30]  Like, he shows up late.  And we all had, like, a groove, kind of.  And I remember telling him, like, people going at each other are, like, pretty hard.  So just be aware of that.  And then, like, his first day was that day where he's eating breakfast.  And he's like, James Franklin's not going to dick tonight.  And we were all just like, oh, Jesus Christ.  Danny came to play.  Yeah, it was brilliant.  That wasn't in the script?  No, not at all.  A lot of improv in that movie.  Yeah, lots of improv, yeah.  That's funny.  When you're just asked to make fun of your friends' careers, it's easier to improv. 
[01:35:00]  What's more satisfying than that?  Nothing's worse than that.  That's just eviscerating your friends.  But then you get a two-time Academy Award nominee.  I know, like Jonah.  Now, obviously, you guys, how do you handle that one?  It's not with a, hey, congratulations.  Do you just shit all over?  Or just praise the guys that won?  Honestly, when he got nominated for Moneyball, there was some sense of, like, obviously, he's  great in the movie.  But, like, it's a very toned-down performance. 
[01:35:30]  And there's some sense of, like, oh, great.  You weren't funny.  And you got nominated for an Oscar.  Congratulations.  But, like, for Wolf of Wall Street, honestly, like, that was one of my favorite movies of  the year.  And I thought he was, like, so fucking funny in it.  And amazing.  And amazing.  But it, like, is like a comedic performance.  So when he got nominated for that, I actually, like, I talked to, I, like, went off for hours  about how psyched I was.  Oh, wow, yeah.  Because it was like, he, he, it wasn't like a toned-down, like, subtle thing he was doing. 
[01:36:00]  Like, it was a balls-to-the-wall, like, fucking crazy thing he was doing.  It's like when Jimmy found out Tommy was going to be made.  Yeah.  Whoops.  We all know how that ended.  Yeah, they, uh, that movie got a lot of fucking hate for a lot of people.  Like, well, they praise a bear, like, like, like Goodfellas didn't or The Godfather didn't.  Well, like America doesn't.  I mean, that, to me, is the whole point of the movie is, like, it's directly reflective  of what happened in real life.  Like, this guy did fucking partied his nuts off, stole money from everyone, and he's totally 
[01:36:30]  fine in the end of the story.  Like, and that's a direct product of, like, the culture we live in.  And so, I think that's why people didn't like it, because they don't like the American  product of what happened, you know?  They don't like the truth dangled in front of their faces.  Exactly.  They don't like to see, like, oh, I live in a country where a guy can rip people off,  do drugs till those fucking dick falls off, and then be totally fine at the end of the  day.  Yeah, yeah.  We only have a few more minutes, I heard.  This upcoming project about the first buddy cop pairing.  Oh, yeah.  With Kevin Hart, yeah. 
[01:37:00]  This has potential, man.  I think it does, yeah.  It's a funny...  You guys start filming yet, or?  No, we start probably next year.  All right, so this is down the road, but I mean, the concept is great.  The first interracial cop pairing in history, and it takes place in the 40s.  Yeah, in the 40s.  And it's you and Kevin Hart.  I could just imagine the jokes with this thing.  And I play a Jewish guy, obviously.  It's funny, because it gives you an excuse to be, like, really racist and really anti-semitic  at all times.  Like, everyone hates Jewish people and black people at that time. 
[01:37:30]  And it's about how we get teamed up to, like, infiltrate the jazz scene to, like, bust jazz  musicians for smoking weed, which they actually...  The reefer, yeah.  Like, it all comes from, like, a line in this book that the writer, Rodney, was reading,  where it just said, like, the FBI attempted to send agents into the jazz scene to bust  the musicians for smoking marijuana.  They were unsuccessful.  And, like, we always just looked at that one line, and we're like, that's a fucking funny  movie.  Holy shit, yeah.  And so... 
[01:38:00]  That's all took.  Fucking line.  That's great.  So, yeah, we just kept working backwards from the scene, where it's just, like, me next  to Kevin Hart, and I'm like, he's my partner?  You realize he's black.  I'm going to look forward to that.  Sounds good, yeah.  But right now...  Neighbors.  Neighbors.  Oh, I want to mention one other thing.  Lisa Kudrow, she's only in it for five minutes, maybe.  She's fucking hilarious.  Yeah, she's unbelievably funny.  In everything she does.  I just heard her show is coming back.  Yeah, six episodes, which is one of the most underrated shows ever.  Oh, I love that show.  It was fantastic.  It's so funny. 
[01:38:30]  I remember, like, one of my first dates with my wife, we sat and watched the comeback.  It was hard to watch.  Like, there were some scenes, just like, oh, no, she's not going to...  Oh, fuck, she is.  There's something with her husband, like, shitting or something like that.  Like, they filmed her husband shitting, and he doesn't...  Like, it was such a funny fucking show.  The way she approached the writers of the show.  She wanted more.  Like, oh, don't give me that.  And they hated her.  Or when the stepdaughter said something and called her mom, and she couldn't believe that  the stepdaughter called her mom, and she went, ch-ch-ch-changes. 
[01:39:00]  It's literally the most uncomfortable I've ever been.  Ever.  Yeah.  Mottola, who directed Superbad, directed that, I remember.  It's great.  Yeah, she was amazing in that.  So good.  She's awesome.  Yeah.  I'm psyched about that.  Well, Seth, man, you just killed the trust.  Thank you so much.  That was so much fun.  This was amazing.  Absolutely.  Neighbors opens up Friday.  Friday, May 9th.  And theaters everywhere.  And like I said, a bunch of us saw it in the theater district.  Oh, man.  Just loved it.  Awesome. 
[01:39:30]  So.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, guys.  Have fun.  We'll see you next time.  Yeah, for sure.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Let's do it.  Noises.  Noises.  Noises. 
[01:40:00]  Noises.  Noises.  Noises.  Kids are in the pool.  Now back to the Opal and Anthony Show.  On SiriusXM.  That line doesn't work.  What's that?  The kids are in the pool.  No?  Used to be the Cosby kids, right?  That old gang?  Oh, my goodness.  That's racist.  It's racist.  Right.  But to just say the kids are in the pool, it doesn't make sense. 
[01:40:30]  2014.  I didn't hear the whole thing.  Our generation, we used to say the Cosby kids.  Oh, man.  I know it's very bad to say now in 2014, and I want to acknowledge that, god damn it, but  back in the day, it was acceptable.  As far as humor goes.  As far as humor goes.  As far as a lot of things.  Human sacrifice.  Sure.  At some point, that was completely acceptable.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I've got to state the obvious, that Seth Rogen just killed it for us for 45 straight minutes.  He's fantastic.  He's fantastic.  The energy, the jokes. 
[01:41:00]  Yep.  Very entertaining.  He's a good guy.  And like Jimmy said, during break, he said that he'll talk about anything, too.  Yeah.  Which is very refreshing, because he's a big star.  A big star!  He's just what you want a guest to be.  He's really funny, and he'll talk about anything, and he doesn't panic about it.  Like, hey, don't bring that up, guys.  Right.  He's fucking great.  Seth Rogen does not get that picture.  It'll make him a big star.  That's perfect for him.  There's a man with a beard who smokes pot in it.  Shows his penis.  Yeah, he can spit anything.  But then you get a Paris Hilton, and she's annoyed by simple questions. 
[01:41:30]  Fucking a card with a K.  Stand her.  He makes Seth Rogen really makes me laugh, man.  Yeah, he's a good guy.  Most comic actors I don't quite enjoy, but he is great.  He knows how to do radio, that's for sure.  He really gets it, so.  We got Dawny.  She's going to leave soon.  My sister Dawny.  Oh, right, right, right.  And somebody here wanted to meet my sister.  Ooh, Seth.  And it's, uh, yes, Denny Falcone.  Step up to the mic. 
[01:42:00]  There you go.  Oh, a hot mic?  Is this a hot mic?  It's a hot mic.  Wouldn't look good on a t-shirt.  Now he's telling you.  I know.  It's a put-on.  I heard Dawn's.  I heard Dawn's.  Oh.  Oh.  I caught it.  Oh.  You're not happy that it's Dennis Falcone that wants to meet you.  No.  No.  No.  I was actually chasing down Sam.  I was chasing down Roland at the 20th anniversary thing, because I was like, where's  Dennis Falcone?  I wanted to meet him.  He had already left.  He's a legend.  He, like, sort of ducked out of there. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, he doesn't hang out long.  Yeah.  He's a cut-out early kind of guy.  Well, you do know he blows himself, so he probably left to get one in before dinner.  He'll talk like that in front of a lady or something.  Well, that would be much more fun than meeting me, I'm sure.  He doesn't want to say it in front of a lady, but he's proud of the fact that he can blow  himself.  He was complaining.  He was complaining that he had to pay for drinks at the Unmasked.  I told him he should just drink his own jizz like usual.  Yeah.  Wow.  Like, I called Denny one time.  I'm like, what are you doing?  He texts me back, I can't talk.  I'm MFM-ing.  What's that stand for?  Mouthfucking myself. 
[01:43:00]  Myself.  Myself.  Of course.  You do that?  No.  But that's a good bar trick.  I mean, you'd get free drinks if people could check you out as you blow yourself.  Because he lays on his back and he can put his feet on the floor behind him.  Right, yeah.  And then he just puts a finger in his own asshole and he pushes his cock into his...  I'm trying to clean it up.  Trying to clean it up.  That's a respectful thing.  Yeah.  So, what's going on here?  Who wants to meet who again?  Dennis.  Just wanted to say hello to Anthony Sisko. 
[01:43:30]  Well, I wanted to meet Dennis, too, because I wanted to talk to him about Anthony's Fourth of  July party.  Right.  Because there's going to be a big bash.  My birthday is also around that time.  And we thought, who better to spin the tunes, right?  Than Danny Falcone in the Hard Drive of Hits.  Exactly.  And he could do his trick.  Everyone else's book, huh?  Right.  Yes.  His trick.  His trick.  Oh, that trick.  He throws himself.  Well, I know that trick.  I thought there were more tricks.  Come on, bright eyes.  Do your trick.  I think one of Anthony's typical parties, it's really...  No one's really going to care much.  That is true. 
[01:44:00]  That is true.  Put that on your flyer, Dennis.  Bright eyes do your trick.  Like, what's that from?  Planet bees.  Planet bees.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on, bright eyes.  Do your trick.  He's trying to talk.  Yeah, we want to have Danny Falcone spinning all the hits.  Dates are filling up fast.  Oh, man.  I know.  All right.  We've got to pick a day.  You know who says that, by the way?  What's that?  People that have nothing to do.  Thank you.  I'm already...  People whose calendar has a lot of snow on it.  Right. 
[01:44:30]  I'm booked on the fourth.  I'm booked on the fifth.  A lot of people say dates filling up fast because they don't really have a lot of dates.  How about we make it the fifth at night?  Saturday the fifth.  Saturday?  At night?  Got a wedding.  Blow it off, bro.  Oh.  I got a wedding.  I think a lot of people will be off that Friday anyway.  What about the fourth at night?  At night, yeah.  We could do that.  You're going to change your party date just so you can get one...  No offense to any person.  No.  I personally don't care.  It's a federal holiday.  People will be off.  I'll be...  People will be off that Friday.  Yeah, definitely.  Blow off.  All right.  We'll do the fourth at night. 
[01:45:00]  No.  Blow off the wedding, Dennis.  Then again, people are watching fireworks and there's a lot of traffic on the fourth.  Yeah, right.  Sure.  People are not going to want to drive to Long Island on the fourth.  That's true.  Oh, shit.  That's true.  Show some loyalty.  Kick that wedding.  That's a problem to door, man.  It's a compound party.  I mean, that's...  How about the fact of the matter is, the party will be Friday and Saturday because my parties  usually go the entire weekend.  Just say you can't do the...  Say, look, I had a rape thing.  I don't have to go to trial.  I pulled a hammy blowing myself. 
[01:45:30]  I got to cancel on you.  We're doing the Dawn's Birthday segment on Friday with Denny Falcone, Friday night.  And then Saturday will be the 4th of July party.  It'll just continue over into that.  So, you know, you people, all the usual suspects know who you are.  You're cordially invited there.  Sounds nice.  I just throw an invite out.  And don't forget this Saturday.  Yes.  Oh.  May 10th.  At the Village Idiot Pub in Patchogue.  It will be Brother Joe, me, Adornie, who else? 
[01:46:00]  Alex, next to Reedys, Joe Curry, Mikey Potato Head, Cowbell Bill is playing drums.  It's going to be a cavalcade of 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, thousands music.  It's like a live version.  A cavalcade of fuckos.  Yeah, a cavalcade of fuckos.  That's actually on the flyer.  What time does that start?  What time does that start?  About nine?  Nine-ish.  Nine-ish, yeah.  I've got a gig not too far from there. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, really?  When does that wrap up?  About 8 o'clock or something.  You know what?  Come on down.  The Village Idiot Pub in Patchogue.  It's, yeah, Saturday the 10th.  Oh, Fat Opie Hugh Bond will be there.  Fat Opie Hugh Bond.  They call him Fat Opie.  Still go by Fat Opie.  There'll be some classic music, new music, and also some of the parodies you've known  and loved over the course of the years from this very program.  Hey, Masturbator?  I don't think Hey, Masturbator will be played. 
[01:47:00]  Not that it couldn't.  But I choose not to.  Why?  You should...  I know.  Hey, Masturbator!  I forgot about that one.  Oh, boy.  Made my bones on that.  Or the hit.  The hit.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, so join us.  Something like Macarena.  Right, Chipper.  See?  Boy.  All right, this was exciting.  Thanks, man.  Thanks for having me.  Amazing.  Amazing radio.  Thank you.  It's like the meeting at Yalta.  This is fantastic. 
[01:47:30]  Very nice.  Thank you again, guys.  I would love to hang, but I've got to get to work.  Yeah, see?  Dawn knows.  Yeah, Dawn knows how to make a getaway.  I've got to make a good exit.  All right, Dawn.  We'll see you on Patchogue on Saturday.  Bye, Dawn.  Yes.  Have fun, Dawn.  Bye-bye.  Be careful.  Bye, Dawn.  See you later.  I was hoping for a hug.  Oh, give Denny a hug.  Not meant to be.  Give Denny a hug.  Oh, boy.  Denny couldn't get his head...  Wow, look at that.  Oh, man.  Tight squeeze.  Unhand her.  You brute.  Oh, Dawny.  Bye-bye.  Bye, Dawny.  I'll see you.  And Anthony gave a big hug. 
[01:48:00]  Yes.  Oh, Jim Norton.  Grab the ass.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Bye, Dawn.  Love you.  Love you, mister.  Oh, Jesus.  Very nice lady.  Can we discuss the fact that Denny looks horrible  and hats?  Am I the only one?  Yes.  Am I the only one?  Oh, you're still here.  Sorry.  I thought you left.  It's a good hat, yes.  But the problem is the fucking thumb under it.  You look like a posterior kid or something.  Aw.  His make-a-wish was to meet Don Cummings.  Oh.  Yeah.  Hi, I'm Denny Falcone. 
[01:48:30]  I'm just an ordinary kid.  Kid?  I like DJing.  And my wish is to DJ a compound party, if you can make that happen.  Brooklyn Nets, huh?  Yeah.  Go Nets tonight.  In Miami.  I guess they're still in it.  Oh, they're still in it, huh?  No, they won game seven.  Now they've got to play the Heat.  LeBron.  That is a badass thing that they did.  Just black and white, fucking Brooklyn.  It's a cool logo.  You know?  They're selling a lot of fucking gear, huh?  Very cool logo.  On Monday night, they lit up the Empire State Building in Nets colors, black and white. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, yeah?  You can't see the black, though.  I don't know why they did that, then.  They should have discussed it.  You can't see the black and white.  You can't light up a building in black.  Yeah.  It can't be done.  Yeah.  No.  But I got a nice letter.  Could I read my nice letter on the end?  Wow.  What is this, Denny?  I hope it's from Sirius X7 and it begins.  We regret to inform you.  I don't know.  It's a Denny.  I hope it's when you're going to leave after your next activity.  I just wanted to give you an email of a fan. 
[01:49:30]  At 61 years old, I may not be the typical XM subscriber since I'm as likely to be listening  to Opie and Anthony as I am to be listening to 60s on 6.  Wow.  Actually, it was because of you on O&A that I listened to you on the 60s.  So you guys have moved another listener to another part of the platform.  Hey, that's great.  We've chased the fan away to another channel.  He enjoys me on here and enjoys me on the 60s.  I just wanted to thank you for that.  And enjoy you on the 60s.  And I'm also on the 70s, too, now, on the weekends.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've heard that. 
[01:50:00]  I'm Dennis the 70s Menace.  Oh.  Is that what you call yourself?  No, he doesn't.  Dennis the 70s Menace?  Oh, my God.  Oh, holy shit.  I love it.  I thought of that name and I thought of you guys how much you'd appreciate it.  Did you see it in lights and then it explodes?  I see it on the screen and it looks balls.  Dirk Diggler.  I just see this name.  It's up in lights and then it's so strong and so bright that it just explodes.  Dirk Diggler.  Jack, Jack, could you call me Dennis the 70s Menace? 
[01:50:30]  Jack?  Yeah, yeah.  And then, all right, Denny Falcone, you get the, Jack, it's, you know, Dennis the 70s Menace.  Oh, I'm sorry.  So, Dennis the 70s Menace, Jack tells me you've got quite a tiny, thin head on you.  May I see it?  I love it.  All right there, Dennis Diggler.  Thank you, Colonel.  Very good.  The Colonel, very good.  Nice. 
[01:51:00]  You're my friend.  I was on, but now I'm gone.  That's a sign-off.  Everyone's got to have a sign-off.  That's a T-shirt, my friend.  That's a T-shirt right there.  That right there is a radio professional you're watching leave.  No jokes.  That's a radio pro.  He knows how the game is played.  We went from Seth Rogen to Dennis Falcone.  To Dennis Falcone.  What happened?  I know.  Chris DiStefano's in the building.  We should have just talked to him.  He's really funny.  What happened?  He's great.  Yeah, I know.  Don't yell at me.  I wasn't even yelling.  Where is he?  He's doing sway. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, he's doing sway.  My fuck.  Remember him?  Oh, he was on the...  He's going to get seasick if he flayed.  Oh, Jesus fucking call me and stole my thunder.  Oh, shit.  He's the...  You know, he's on in Montreal.  No, I know exactly who he is.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we would take him.  Yeah, y'all tell him to say bye.  All right.  Are we doing the comedy thing again this year?  We should.  I know I'm going up.  We should.  It worked out so well last time.  I don't know.  Don's trying to figure it out.  Whatever.  It worked out so well last time.  We need to really fuck it up so we have a horrible memory of it this year. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  It was too good last time.  I like Montreal.  I have a gig up there.  I got a whole thing.  A speech.  I got a...  You know, it's a whole thing.  A thing?  What is that?  It's a whole thing.  Is it big?  Yeah.  The state of comedy.  Remember Colin did it last year?  Fucking state of comedy.  Where's that?  By, like, Wyoming?  Na'jokesa.  Oh, that's mad.  Yeah, massive.  Two laughs.  Are you nervous? 
[01:52:30]  No.  I probably will be as I go to...  It's a big spot.  Nah, but...  You've got all your peers in the room looking for you to talk about the state of comedy.  But, yeah, I think that's fairly...  I'm not going to say easy to do.  It's not easy to do, but it's one of those things where I'm comfortable doing it.  We've talked about what I think is wrong with what's happening enough here or so.  Right.  Again, I hope I wouldn't freeze up and suck.  Oh, that would be terrible.  Yeah.  It would be.  We talked about the kitten kicker.  I want to see it. 
[01:53:00]  Well, we didn't really finish talking about him.  Well, what else is there to say?  He was arrested.  I think everyone agrees that's just horrific.  That's good.  He was arrested.  He has eight prior charges.  Oh, he does?  What?  No, one was a weapons charge with a knife, robbery.  A few of the other ones are sealed for some reason.  I don't know why your records are sealed like that, probably.  His mother said he's a nice boy. 
[01:53:30]  He loves animals, and he had to have been high if he was doing that, which is just great guidance on part of the mother.  Very out of his character.  Oh, is it?  No, it's not.  He had to be high to do what he did.  This isn't him.  He loves animals.  He loved his cats.  He had dogs.  He always loved them.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Like Michael Vick, I bet.  He loved his dogs.  Enough.  God, I like they put ultimate in savagery in the paper. 
[01:54:00]  That's good, because that is.  And then I get in trouble for using that word.  And then I use the N-word also.  I said that people that say that there's never a reason to use the N-word are idiots, because that is a reason to use it.  You see him, and I did.  I said I dropped some N-bombs at home yesterday when I saw this story.  And someone said, now why would you use that word and this?  And my answer is, why tame it down a notch when you despise what somebody has done and what they are? 
[01:54:30]  Why is a word too harsh to use for somebody that's doing that or raping somebody or murder?  Because you use the same word when somebody cuts you off or talks loud in the movies.  I definitely do, Jimmy Norton.  Perhaps I use it too much, but it's not saying.  Oh, wow.  That's a face.  That's a face.  That's bad.  Isn't that great?  Oh, that's going to leave a bruise back.  Very funny. 
[01:55:00]  But, yeah, so that guy, I guess, but nothing will happen to him.  I mean, no one really does anything when animals get fucked up.  It's a shame.  Breaking news.  What happened?  I see someone out there with food.  Oh, no.  Enough with food.  But this might be the make-good from the guacamole king.  Oh, no.  Give it to the homeless.  Oh, good.  What is it?  Tacos at the front of the morning.  What's going on?  I'm not going to eat them.  What's going on? 
[01:55:30]  It's May 6th.  Have fun.  It's May 6th.  Yeah, it's Willie Mays' day.  Willie Mays is 84 today.  That's very depressing.  Seis de mayo.  Yeah, that's true.  How old is he?  84.  84 years young.  I tell the story when the Mets picked him up, and I was excited.  I swear I was a little kid at the time.  And we're all excited and not understanding that he was like 45 years old.  He finally made the Mets.  Just a useless list.  We thought we really had something. 
[01:56:00]  Meet the Mets.  Greet the Mets.  Stay at home and play golf with the Mets.  Golf with the Mets.  That's still one of my dumb biggest laughs on the show.  Stay at home and play golf with the Mets.  No postseason.  That's like when they brought Tom Seaver back to the Mets.  Remember that?  He did all right.  He did better than Willie Mays.  He did all right.  Oh, it was no fucking 1969.  No, that's true.  Man.  Let's see what the food's all about. 
[01:56:30]  What is that?  Oh, I just want to feel it.  So, any girls?  Any beautiful girls?  I hope not.  You're beautiful girls.  You're beautiful girls.  Ro!  Oh, my zipper.  What's going on out there?  We have food.  We have food.  What the hell is it?  What is this?  How are we going to make this interesting?  It's some kind of a...  Get my food over.  From yesterday?  Very nice.  Some kind of a...  It smells great.  Oh, my...  Hello.  You sure you don't want that?  Well, that looks good. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, it does...  What do we got, Ro?  It smells very good.  Thank you very much.  I just want to acknowledge that, you know, Stephen Starr, you know, did the make good.  Stephen Starr?  He didn't have to in the end because he gave his...  You're going to make him a Stephen Starr.  Bring tortilla chips and salsa.  Yeah.  Don't cheese tortilla.  Oh, no.  There's more chips, though.  Right with the chips.  Enough about the chips.  We get it.  What's that?  What's that?  I'm in a loop.  They're all more chips. 
[01:57:30]  They're about Mahi Mahi.  Oh, Mahi Mahi tacos?  Hand them over.  No, I don't like fish tacos.  Fish tacos rule.  I want steak.  Yeah.  Or chicken.  This time you're in California, you have fish tacos.  They know exactly how to do it.  Nice fish taco.  Better not be any goddamn clean.  That's how I eat the fish taco.  Yeah, me too.  With two fingers in a shucka, shucka, shucka.  Squish, squish, follow-up.  Squish, squish, follow-up. 
[01:58:00]  You got rice and beans.  Oh, rice and beans.  Oh.  No, I'm not going to...  What do we put on the fish tacos?  I'll wait for a break.  Yeah.  What do we put on the fish tacos?  Is there any fixings?  No, there's rice and beans if you want.  That's not fixings.  Everything's in there.  Everything's in there.  Yeah.  Everything's in there.  All right.  I'll have some rice and beans.  Thank you to Stephen, not Singer, Stephen Starr, right?  We've got a lot of Stephens that are...  Yes.  What the hell was I going to say? 
[01:58:30]  I forgot.  God.  You're talking about the cat.  Well, yeah.  I think nothing will happen to that guy.  Well, what could they do in the end?  That's just it.  No one does anything for poor little animals.  What do you get for cruelty to animals in the end?  Michael Vick pretty much got the most you could ever get for doing stuff to animals,  and that was just the most heinous thing.  Right.  I mean, you kick a kitten, it's horrific, but I don't know what...  Could someone help us out with that?  What's animal cruelty?  But what do you get for that?  We need someone in law enforcement.  Probably get a fine, but, you know, he'll just say that he can't pay it, and nothing. 
[01:59:00]  His mama will be out there talking to him.  Is it crazy good?  No!  Listeners love this part.  Jimmy, you're not trying one.  No, I'm not.  Just tacos.  I'm sure they're good, but my eating has been a little rough lately, so I'm done eating bad.  Too many cookies?  Yeah, I bet on the set the other day, I had fucking a slice of pizza, some ice cream.  Oh, boy.  Couldn't help it.  It was there.  Yeah.  What the fudge?  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  Good?  Yeah, it does look good.  God damn it.  So, I was just going to wait until the break.  I figure, you know.  Well, why don't we break?  We should make this an exciting contest.  What should the contest pay?  The best...  Taco off?  Enchilada?  Yeah.  Let's take a break.  All right, let's do that.  A quick one.  I'm in.  Because I don't want to hear a Z.  No.

[02:05:00]  That food was ridiculous.  How was yours?  Motherfucking tasty as all hell.  I'm not going to make fun of his salsa anymore and his guac.  That was really unbelievably good.  Holy crap.  I know.  I think you said yesterday, Mexican food is like, it's the same ingredients.  Yeah.  It's really hard to do much with it. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Man, was that good.  There's tacos rule.  Yummy.  They sent a whole bunch, right?  Yeah.  I don't know how much they sent.  Do you want some?  No.  I still got some.  Oh, no, no.  I don't.  I don't.  Oh, Jimmy.  What didn't you eat?  Have a bite.  Nah.  You're in the mood for Mexican food in the morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is a little rough in the morning, but.  All right.  There was something else.  I think it's their corporate office, not one you can drop that off in. 
[02:06:00]  Sorry, just doing a little Siri.  Is that distracting?  Oh, not really.  Corporate office, not one you can drop it off in.  I think that's what?  Some type of UPS FedEx thing?  I have a sneeze coming.  Oh.  Look at the light.  No, you got to really, like.  I don't want to look at the light.  Look at the light.  Just go like this.  I like to sneeze. 
[02:06:30]  Get that person out.  I know.  Boy, is that non-realized sneeze so bad.  But it's funny when someone's struggling through that.  They start making, like I said earlier.  See?  Start making handy, capable faces.  Right.  They're getting to me.  I'm having a tougher time.  I can be capable.  Like this.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Yeah.  Did you know that there's something called powdered alcohol? 
[02:07:00]  I only learned about this yesterday.  I heard tell of this a little while ago.  You did?  Yeah.  The kids today, man.  Wow.  They're telling the kids not to snort it.  Yeah, but I didn't even know this was a possibility.  I don't even know what this is.  The state senator has introduced a bill to ban the sale of powdered alcohol products in New York.  You know, I mean, doing a radio show every day, you feel like you know, like you said back in the day, a little bit about everything. 
[02:07:30]  Right.  I've never heard of powdered alcohol before.  You've really heard of this stuff.  I've heard of it.  What, did you just add it to your water like Iraq adds the goodness to his?  His goodness flavorings.  I don't know how it works, what it is, or what it's used for.  Right.  So I know nothing about this except that it does indeed exist.  They're trying to ban it, prohibit anyone under 21 from possessing.  Of course.  Well, that's the drinking age anyway, right? 
[02:08:00]  Right.  It's known as Palkahol.  Your pal.  Yeah.  Yes.  This is awaiting.  It's awaiting federal approval to hit shelves by the fall.  Wow.  Do we really need powdered alcohol?  And how would you use this?  Spirits distilled from Cain.  Uh-huh.  What?  The wrestler?  Cain's in the alcohol business.  That's nice.  Yes.  What, uh, do we have any info on this?  Because I don't know what it is, but it's time I learned. 
[02:08:30]  There's got to be one person out there that knows what this is about.  Do you just add it to water?  Do you just add it to mixers?  Yeah.  How do you, do you have to add it to water first, then add your mixers?  Ah, can you sprinkle it on your sausage?  Oh, good question.  Can you use it with sprinkling?  Right.  You, uh, yeah, you can use the pouch as a glass, and you just pour water in the pouch.  That is really sleazy.  And it's called pal-cohol, because you can take your pal wherever you go.  I like that. 
[02:09:00]  It's just about getting fucked off.  It's just about getting fucked off.  You've got to get fucked off.  How good could it possibly be?  Well, it's made from premium Puerto Rican rum.  You just add a mixer for an instant cocktail.  So it would be a rum cocktail.  Puerto Rican rum?  That's right.  That's where some of the good rum comes from.  Are those, uh, Puerto Rico.  I thought it came from Jamaica.  Well, Jamaican rum's pretty good, too.  That's the number one, right?  I don't know.  I would say so.  Where's Bacardi from? 
[02:09:30]  Eh, I don't know.  I like that Captain Morgan.  Spiced rum.  Yeah.  So that's it.  It's five ounces of water.  Add it to that pouch.  You get yourself a nice little beverage.  But how much alcohol is that?  Like, the equivalent of...  58 alcohol.  58 beers?  Damn.  58% alcohol by weight.  It's probably a drink.  Like, however, it's probably the same as...  You get your drink on.  Your drank is what it would be.  Your drank?  Drank.  Oh, yeah.  Put it in your...  I guess you could, but I don't know anybody who has rum in there. 
[02:10:00]  This is a product that will not be on the top shelves, let's say.  They couldn't even get that fucking energy drink with alcohol in it made.  Right.  They couldn't keep Four Loko on the shelf.  Four Loko.  All right.  How are they going to keep Palkahol?  Why couldn't they?  They're not going to allow Palkahol.  Kids are...  No.  Let's say hi to Nate in Texas.  It's good for camping.  This guy...  Hold on. 
[02:10:30]  I've got to go to Scott, Tennessee.  Where are you going?  It's good for camping.  Scott, go ahead.  Yeah, I mean, you know, when you go camping, pick out how many times you have to carry cases  of beer and bottles of liquor and wine up.  This way, you can just take your Palkahol, find a stream, boil some water, and you're set.  Easy to carry.  Very natural.  You're like survival, man.  That's just...  Drunk, though.  Well, that's just being an alcoholic at that point.  Yeah.  I can't imagine you're actually enjoying the Palkahol.  If you're getting water from a stream.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:11:00]  A stream?  Oh, boy.  This weekend.  Ugh.  This weekend, Sal was on an all-guys camping trip.  Oh, just fucking sucking Kyle.  Oh, my God.  That sounds awful.  All of his guy friends.  That sounds horrendous.  Leave the ladies at home.  That was it.  They all had to leave their girlfriends at home.  Where is he?  Is he here today?  He's my homo.  Bring him in here.  He actually took a day off work to go on his guy's camping trip.  Oh.  And then he said he ran into some chicks.  Right.  But they wouldn't approach him because it was a guy's camping trip. 
[02:11:30]  Ran into some chicks.  So they ran in.  In the woods?  Yeah.  So they saw a bunch of girls camping.  And instead of going and being like, hey.  They were like, fuck that.  You know damn well they didn't see any girls camping.  No.  It's not one of the stories.  I want to hear Sal try to make this cool.  Sound cool.  I wonder if they had any Palkahol with them.  They probably did.  Oh man.  Imagine hipster camping.  They're trying to put Palkahol in each other's assholes.  Oh God.  No.  It just takes effect quicker.  Yeah.  Oh God.  You blow it up each other's asses. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Just blow it in my ass.  The Palkahol's in it.  It's not gay.  I'm just trying to get you drunk.  No.  I'm getting you fucked up.  And then you've got to get it in deeper with your dick.  So yeah.  Can you push it in with something?  No.  Don't use that twig.  Sal.  You know I'm loving you lately.  Oh Sal.  But going camp with a bunch of guys.  Explain to us why that's cool.  Where did you go?  We went to, I don't know the exact trail name.  Do you have a Paisley tent you hipster?  No we actually didn't bring any tents.  Oh.  No that was just the euphemism for the front of their sweats. 
[02:12:30]  We went to some.  Wait.  You don't know the trail name.  I don't know the trail name.  But it was this.  It was the Hershey Highway.  Yes.  The old dirt road.  We'll start there.  It was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a part of the Finger Lakes Trail outside.  Oh Finger.  Finger.  Finger.  Finger in each other's assholes right?  I know what lake they were fingering.  Yeah.  The Lake Sal.  Yeah.  I mean.  How many fingers can you take?  Were you the champion of the guys camping trip?  Yeah.  Was around the corner fudge was made somewhere? 
[02:13:00]  Was that it?  Right.  Did you guys know in his mouth fudge was made?  Everything is like milk, milk and he points his mouth lemonade and then in here fudge is made.  Everything in his mouth.  Right.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But yeah.  It was fun.  We went for three days, two nights.  Oh.  And.  Dirty dudes.  Yeah.  You are filthy the entire fucking time.  Oh I bet you're filthy.  Dirt.  Don't you wash out your.  Don't you wash each other's assholes in the stream? 
[02:13:30]  That could be a good activity.  Yeah.  That would be kind of fun.  A good morning activity.  We did a lot of.  Use each other's beards as the scrub brush for your assholes.  Oh my god.  But yeah.  We did a lot of hiking.  We did about like.  Ooh.  Like total I think it was like 15 miles of hiking.  Hiking.  Hmm.  It's like.  It's fucking.  It's heavy.  But where do you hike to?  You hike to like different lean to sites.  It's like a lean to is like.  Oh a lean to.  A lean to.  A lean to.  A lean to.  A lean to.  How many in a lean to?  I'll give you a kneel and I'll give you a lean to. 
[02:14:00]  Do you wear hiking boots and those real short jean shorts?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All rolled up.  Like the upper upper thigh.  Yeah.  A lean to is kind of like just.  It's like kind of like.  We know what a lean to is.  Jesus Christ.  But we wouldn't be caught dead in there with another guy.  Another dude.  You know we ought to really just get together and hug for warmth.  Right.  It's fucking 80 degrees out.  What?  We're just trying to stay warm.  We're just trying to survive here people.  What?  It's freezing.  What are you a homophobe? 
[02:14:30]  It's two o'clock in the afternoon.  They're all snuggled together.  The sun couldn't be higher.  Why would you just hike to lean to's?  Did you hike to like I don't know a waterfall or a good overlook?  There's tons of that on this particular trail we went to.  But the second night we got to lean to like Sam was saying.  There was some Cornell girls there.  Nice.  Nice.  What were their names?  They were all dogs. 
[02:15:00]  They weren't like remotely.  Not hot like the guys you're meeting.  They were dogs.  They were granola girls.  You know like real like.  Who was prettier?  The guys you were with or the girls?  Be honest.  I wasn't with any girls.  No the guys you were with or those girls.  I mean the girls yeah.  But they were like really awful.  Did you say ew when you saw them?  No.  No.  They were just.  They were doing something for some school shit.  Oh yuck.  Those girls are awful.  The second night.  The internal genitals. 
[02:15:30]  It poured.  It was like raining really really hard.  So we had to sleep in like a makeshift car tent.  Do tell.  Yeah.  Exactly.  A makeshift car tent.  Did one of them spin in their palm?  And fucking rub it on your head?  And one of our friends he um.  Cause like you hear like coyotes and shit like howling.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  The coyotes howling I bet.  That's the reason you're canoodling.  Right.  But it's not even like.  That's just the sound that they make. 
[02:16:00]  Right.  The first time their asshole.  It's ow.  Is that a coyote?  No it's Mark.  That's the initiation right?  Oh that's look man camp.  That's where you were?  You went to man camp?  No I did not.  Why would you do that?  So one of my friends had to take a shit in the middle of the night.  He stupid and he didn't tell anybody.  Who's chest?  His fudge wasn't properly packed in.  No no.  Take the shit that he's washed his dick off.  So he didn't tell anybody. 
[02:16:30]  He just went up and it was pouring rain.  He got stuck out there for an hour and a half.  He couldn't find the tent.  He came back.  He was completely drenched.  It was awful.  I bet.  Did you guys dry him off?  Did he find a bear in the middle of the woods?  There are bears out there.  Oh I'm sure there are.  A lot of bears.  A lot of cubs.  Twinks.  And a tarp tent full of twinks.  So you were staying overnight.  You knew you were going to be there. 
[02:17:00]  So why didn't you have a tent or anything?  Well a tent is actually like really heavy to pack.  So it's actually a lot lighter to just pack a few tarps.  Why didn't you have gone that long?  A few tarps.  You couldn't handle carrying a tent.  I had like 80 pounds in my bag.  Oh you're bad.  Yeah 80 pounds.  I've been after the trip.  It was empty.  Yes.  But yeah so like that was actually a lot lighter.  And it was actually kind of fun to cook outdoors.  Like with the little camping gear and shit like that. 
[02:17:30]  I made pasta of course.  Oh you're dead.  Yeah.  Did you guys eat it like Lady and the Tramp?  No.  Yes out of each other's anuses.  But it was physically like.  I have like marks on my hips and shit.  Why did you say that?  They're called fucking handprints.  Why did you say that?  Or paw prints.  Oh bear got you good huh?  Now how did your hips get bruised up?  Hang on for this wild ride.  Yeah your hips don't lie.  The book bag doesn't really get strapped to your shoulders. 
[02:18:00]  It gets strapped to your hips more.  You put all the weight on your hips to lower the center of gravity.  Oh I got it.  I'm sure you want to lower that center of gravity.  Yeah.  Hiking.  You got a nice target going.  A weight.  Brutal.  It's fucking really hard to do what we did.  Oh to do what?  It stays hard.  Right.  Yeah.  How many dudes?  It was five including me.  Five dudes.  Were you guys able to go more than a mile without sucking each other off?  A little protein.  Every mile they have to stop for a suck break. 
[02:18:30]  All right suck break.  That was awful.  Wow.  It was a lot of fun.  It was a lot of fun.  That sounds great.  It was like it was my first time camping so it wasn't really the first time.  Did you hear any noises in the middle of the night?  Oh yeah.  Were you in the real woods or was it some of this like off the road fucking camping crap?  It was we hiked the first day we only hiked two hours in but the second day we hiked another six hours in.  So it's like if you hear something and you want to go home you're going to hike out of the woods ten hours by yourself in the dark. 
[02:19:00]  Why would you hear something and want to go home?  I want to go home.  Yeah.  A bear comes up and is like all right well are you going to go home?  What are you going to do?  No weapons?  I wanted to bring mine but they all said I couldn't.  Do you want to?  Your weapons in your pants.  That's true.  If you hear something in the middle of the night while you're camping the last thing you're going to attempt is to hike out.  Yeah no.  Because if that noise scares you as you're in a campsite there's no fucking way you're going to be able to like just go on a trail at night. 
[02:19:30]  You'll be scared out of your fucking mind.  Even like because we did the this is another word get ready bear bagging.  I know what bear bagging is.  Oh god.  I know.  You have to take all your food.  The condom off.  Yeah.  Throw caution to the wind.  Fill out a life insurance policy and then come to your heart's delight.  You have to put all your shit in the trees. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah all your food all your toiletries after all the utensils the pots the pans and you gotta move it away from the campsite because then they'll get confused and they'll sniff around that tree for the entire night and you're safe at camp.  Air bagging.  Yeah so it's like I didn't know it was called bear bagging.  Yeah that's the term but it's like it's kind of scary to like wash like all the pots and stuff and like in the middle of the night by a stream and you're looking around.  Why would you do that?  Why would you wait till morning?  Who gives a fuck?  Yeah.  Or just throw that shit away you're done with it. 
[02:20:30]  Even outside the tent.  Right.  And why wouldn't the fruity dudes you're with let you take your fucking gun?  I don't know.  And why didn't you tell them to go fuck themselves and take your fucking gun?  I know.  I think it's illegal to bring it on certain trails that are state-owned.  Oh it was looking.  I know that's true.  None of them is not legal.  Yeah just think of a lawyer as a bear as fucking ripping your face off.  Shall not be infringed.  I love it.  You can't even really kill a bear with like one shot.  Yeah but you can make him want to go to the other guy.  Yeah you got.  What do you got?  12 gauge right? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah 12 gauge.  Yeah you'll fucking tear him up.  We're fucking up everyone's world.  This guy Bean O'Pollis or something like that he writes I have a hiking trip planned  with my buddy in Colorado.  I will now be cancelled.  A little bear bagging.  It was fun.  Like honestly I had a really good time.  Of course you did.  How long were you there for?  I was there three days two nights.  Three days two nights.  Sounds terrible.  And where exactly was this?  This was outside of Ithaca.  Ithaca yeah.  So there were like there was people from Ithaca College and Cornell kids camping there as 
[02:21:30]  well.  Oh boy.  College.  And so we only saw a few people here.  And ugly girls.  Yeah like yucky girls with their stinky vaginas and boobies.  Right.  Exploring the woods and exploring yourselves.  Right.  A lot of exploring going on in that weekend.  I bet.  A different perspective on things when you came back.  Yeah.  You did right?  It was.  You learned a lot.  Like everything you got to do if you're camping is a chore.  Were you all curious in the woods there?  A little bi-curious?  No.  No.  I'm just saying you know curious as to what's going on.  Relax.  We're just asking questions. 
[02:22:00]  Relax.  Relax.  Relax.  Yeah.  That's all.  Are you curious or not?  Yeah.  Like what am I curious like sexually?  Did you feel good when you came out?  No.  Nothing changed like that.  No.  I mean out of the woods when you're finally back in civilization.  Oh you're crazy.  Yeah.  Get your mind out of the rectum.  Oh boy.  No.  Everything's the same.  Your parents must have meant psyched that you finally came out.  They're probably waiting for a while.  Yeah.  No.  No.  Just the rustling.  The eager rustling of like little tent flaps opening as boys scurried discreetly from tent to 
[02:22:30]  tent making liaisons.  You think there was a bunch of scurrying?  Yeah I think there was.  It's like when you fucking turn around behind you and you see rats scurrying.  Yes.  Just everyone's pretending we don't know as you hear like the ffff of the material of sleeping  bags being shared and bodies being explored.  Every tent just smells like ass.  Yeah.  Nipples being sucked. 
[02:23:00]  Backs being bitten.  Hands being held.  I did sleep naked one night.  What?  What?  Why did you offer that?  What?  Did you?  I was in a sleeping bag though.  With who?  No.  Just by myself.  Who was in a tent with you?  Yeah.  There was four other guys.  What the fuck?  Dude.  Dude.  Dude.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Were you hoping that one special friend with the cock like a can of baked beans would come  over?  Here's a thick baked beans cock.  Holy shit.  You slept naked in a tent with other guys? 
[02:23:30]  Right.  Even in your own sleeping bag.  There's no reason to be nude.  Were they naked too?  No.  No.  No.  How do you know?  I had a...  Not much gay buffers involved.  No.  No.  You just got to fucking deal with it.  And a sleeping bag.  That's it.  The sleeping bag I had is good for like minus 55 and I was like sweating.  What is that?  Age?  It sucked.  Oh.  But yeah.  So I was like...  Oh, that's where you draw a line.  Yeah.  Minus 55 and above.  Icky to you, right?  What the fuck though? 
[02:24:00]  Why didn't you just put on some drawers or something?  I did.  But then I was like sweating with those on.  And if you sweat, you're fucked.  So how'd you get changed in the morning without everyone seeing your nude body?  I just had my clothes and you just put the clothes underneath the sleeping bag.  You slip them on really quick and you're good.  Like underwear are going to make that big a difference on how hot you are in the fucking  sleep.  I had the long johns on.  Oh.  Well, there you go.  No.  You didn't.  You said you were nude.  Well, those are the underwear that I put on.  No, you had to take them off.  Oh, I see.  You didn't just open the hatch in the back and stick your butt out the top of the sleeping 
[02:24:30]  bag?  Yeah.  Free lunch?  A question coming in from the Stangles.  Oh, okay.  Oh, nice.  Justin Stangle wants to know, were they really in the woods or was it like the trees behind  a target?  A rest stop.  Yeah.  Yeah, just off the parking lot at the rest stop.  Yeah.  No, it was very deep into the woods.  Oh, very deep.  Deep, deep.  Yeah.  Very deep and penetrating.  He was behind a Roy Rogers rest there.  He got his ass eaten over a fucking bench with family. 
[02:25:00]  He's always a picnic.  Holy shit.  A bunch of turgid, curious, finally free men.  Did anybody have a cowboy hat like that?  No.  Anyone?  I don't think a lot of people could do it.  I really don't think.  Oh, yeah.  I bet.  He's a special kind of man.  I would have a lot of trouble.  I don't know if a lot of people could handle that being so out of your element.  Like, I didn't want to go camping for years.  And then...  Do you know how many people are going to call you a fucking pussy?  Because people go camping in so much more, like, desolate circumstances and with so much 
[02:25:30]  less than you had.  I know.  But it was my first time.  So I want to...  We're only an hour away from a highway at all times.  A lot of people can do it.  No.  A lot of people can do a lot more than that.  Oh, yeah.  For sure.  Like, absolutely.  It was my first time into it.  Did you look at the stars at night?  No.  It was overcast every night.  Oh, that's too bad.  Lean over.  Penny for your thoughts.  That's a shooting star.  You know what that means.  Make a wish.  Oh, it's coming true. 
[02:26:00]  Let me see your starfish.  I suck your cock.  And we're already working on our next one.  Yeah, what's that?  I don't know.  Wow.  Same thing, but in a hotel room.  So they don't get ticks.  Let's make a fork between the two beds.  Yeah.  Make another cellophane.  And just jerk off and look at each other like it's a big window.  How come you didn't invite any girls?  Yeah.  What happened?  It was...  Leave all of them.  Yeah.  You're afraid that stinky gap between their legs would attract bears and other wildlife? 
[02:26:30]  The next one we're doing, we are bringing all of our girlfriends.  Oh, girlfriend.  They got too gay.  They got a little, yeah.  Got too gay.  Did you pick who the girlfriends were this time?  We stopped off at a rest stop and we were just like...  I bet.  Even for recruits.  On the way home, even for like looking at like these awfully looking women, we were like,  all right, I'd fuck her just because it was so...  Oh, yeah!  I'm a man!  I'd fuck her if my dick wasn't through this hole in the wall already. 
[02:27:00]  I'd fuck her if I happened to be inclined to do that with girls.  Just looking for chicks with tits.  Right, exactly.  Bunch of guys fist bumping on the way home so no one talks about what actually happened.  I'd fuck her, yeah!  Yeah!  Everyone pretends they didn't hear that rustling, the eager scurrying from tent to tent explorations.  Just this sound real quiet.  And you hear like a little bit of this...  An occasional... 
[02:27:30]  It's got to be quiet.  Quiet sex sound.  Yeah.  The sound of an expert male mouth going down a genital in a way that a woman's never can.  Someone who knows every nook and cranny.  Yeah.  The sound of the balls being cupped and the nose going into the belly button.  Oh, shit!  Oh, my God! 
[02:28:00]  Oh, is that awful?  Wow!  Oh, well, it sounds terrific.  Sounds like quite the outing.  It was.  Yeah.  Not the outing.  Well, it was an outing.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Sal.  All right, Sal.  Congratulations.  Did you bring any palkohol?  I had a...  A what?  Palkohol?  The powdered alcohol?  No.  Yeah.  I had a little thing of Makers, and there was a lot of Buddha being smoked on the truck.  Oh, man!  It's called Buddha! 
[02:28:30]  Ew!  What's Buddha?  Who brought the Buddha?  Ew!  Buddha just choking up on the Buddha.  That's something the opster would have said.  Buddha.  Where's the Buddha?  Did everybody's cock look like the Top of the Maker's Mark bottle?  You know?  You got to know the bottle.  Well...  Pretty smart.  All right, get out of here.  All right.  All right.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Here he goes limping away from his camping trip.  Toking that Buddha. 
[02:29:00]  With his hurt hips and his nudity and his sleeping pants.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Well, you know what he was?  He was the star of the weekend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was.  He does have a little limp.  Yeah.  He does have to the right a little bit.  He's small and waist like this Fiona Appleback.  Wow.  We don't need to know about Palka Hall anymore.  Now I really don't care.  This guy, Chris, has been calling all day.  Oh, yeah.  Chris.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  What's up, guys?  Yellow.  Um, yeah.  I just wanted to pick up for Lady Di a little bit.  What she was talking about when she said, like, last week, that crack is only addictive  while you're doing it.  Yeah.  And she's kind of right because it's not a physiological addiction.  It's a mental addiction.  So there's never enough of it while you're doing it.  But once you, you know, snort and purchase that and fall asleep, you're okay.  She pissed and shit herself when she was on the phone yesterday. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, but you don't get sick from crack.  You get, she was pissing and shitting herself because she's a fucking alcoholic.  You don't get sick.  You don't, you don't get a sickness like you do from heroin.  You get a sickness.  All right, everyone.  Just do crack.  He's more defending crack than he is Lady Di, by the way.  No, no.  I'm not.  I don't mean this.  I'm just trying to, I mean, I know she's a fucking mess.  I think her, but I think it's safe to say her addiction has led her to crack. 
[02:30:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, that I agree with.  All right.  So, I mean, it's a technicality, I think, here.  Yeah.  And hey, I got, before you hang up on me, I got one more thing.  Yeah.  I want to take a guess on who ratted on you guys about the guacamole thing yesterday.  Take a gander.  Wow.  I, first of all, I know it's somebody from the Stern Show.  No.  They don't care enough.  Oh, it's not?  Okay.  Well, I'm way off then.  All right.  Who's from the Stern Show, Jess? 
[02:31:00]  Right.  We actually get along with the Stern staff.  Most of them, anyway.  Or a lot of them.  No fucking coyotes in New York?  I don't know.  Are there coyotes?  There's coyotes in New York.  Yeah, there is.  Yeah, every so often you hear of one of them come trotting down, running down the Westside  Highway and shit like that.  Oh, right.  We do get one from up north.  Yeah, up north, yo.  Yeah, we get them, I guess.  Coyotes seem to be pretty fucking scary.  What's the one animal you're scared of if you go for a hike? 
[02:31:30]  If you go for a hike, there's two that would really be bad, but I don't know which one's  worse than the other.  I think mountain lion is crazy, but a bear, man, I don't know.  Mountain lions, I think, out of fucking nowhere, you're done.  Right.  They're more sneaky, too.  Very sneaky, very fast.  They come upon you from behind.  Like a bear, you usually go like, oh shit, there's a bear, and then he's like, meh, meh.  But they're not flumbers after you.  I don't think they follow you like mountain lions do. 
[02:32:00]  Mountain lions actually follow you and check you out.  That's true.  What about a coyote?  I've never seen a coyote.  You ever seen a coyote in the wild?  Yeah.  I used to blast them in the fucking noggin.  Really?  With a shotgun.  What do they look like in person?  They look like ratty, emaciated dogs.  They look like dogs that are very skinny.  Their hair's all matted and nasty.  Right.  They have like kind of very pointy snouts.  Were they supposed to be dogs and something fucked up? 
[02:32:30]  No, I think dogs came from them and wolves and stuff.  Wolves.  I know dogs came from wolves.  Yeah.  They're kind of nice.  I watch Cosmos.  But they used to jump on some of the livestock.  Yeah.  So we'd have to go up into the hills and fucking blast them when we saw them.  I like shooting guns in big open spaces.  And you just watch that red mist through your scope. 
[02:33:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Got it, motherfucker.  That's a good shot.  It was fun.  Let's say hi to Brad in Los Angeles.  Brad.  Thank you.  Thanks for the call.  Los Angeles.  They shot at my pet coyote.  You had a pet coyote, Chippa?  Yeah.  Damn.  What about, you didn't have a wolf like Lone Wolf McQuaid?  I had a wolf.  You ever see that movie?  Lone Wolf McQuaid? 
[02:33:30]  No.  It was, what's his name?  Lone Wolf McQuaid?  No, no.  Chuck Norris.  Chuck Norris.  And he had a wolf.  It was his pal.  And they killed like his partner, his wife.  They killed all these people.  And he's like, oh, you know, just kind of going through life.  Then they killed his fucking wolf.  And that's when he decided he needed to get rid of that.  Oh, that damn snap.  Yes.  Jesus.  Lone Wolf McQuaid.  We got a pissed off guy about coyotes.  Patrick, go ahead.  Better to be pissed off than, all right. 
[02:34:00]  Morning, guys.  Hey.  Patty.  Hey.  I called a minute ago.  I was the guy that was sad about the coyotes.  And I fucking called back because you said, yeah, there's coyotes in New York.  First of all, you guys got to start camping.  Stopped camping out on the fucking Great Lawn.  Finger Lakes.  Sammy went to the big fucking woods of the Finger Lakes.  Give me a break.  Coyotes are only west of the Mississippi.  Oh, yeah? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  That's been disproven.  That's been disproven.  Google.  Google.  Coy dogs.  What?  Coy dogs.  You have coy dogs.  It's different.  Coy, like Jimmy gets sometimes.  Yes.  You go, come here, boy.  They go, tee.  Why weren't you on this fucking camp out?  Oh, over three.  What did he say?  They call them coyotes here.  I don't know.  Wait.  I see the coy dog.  That looks different than a coyote.  Rush wolf.  That's right. 
[02:35:00]  That's right.  Put coyote New York.  Yeah, New York.  And let's see what comes up.  Nope.  Am I still on?  Wow, this guy's...  Yes, relax for a second.  Well, I'm just wondering why...  The eastern coyote.  What, sir?  Campo.  It is called the Canis latrans, and it is the eastern coyote.  It looks similar to a German shepherd dog, yet are half the weight coyotes are blah-de-blah-de-blah. 
[02:35:30]  It's a coyote.  It doesn't look like a coyote, so he might be right.  It's a coyote, though.  It's an eastern coyote.  He seems like an asshole, but I think he might be right on this one.  No, that means he's explicit.  Wild e. coyote.  Super genius.  Yeah, that doesn't look like a coyote, so you might be right.  No, it looks adorable.  It's an eastern coyote.  Eastern coyote.  What about a traditional coyote in New York?  That's not happening, huh?  I mean, it's in the east.  The coyote.  Right.  I got him in my fucking backyard here in Moab, Utah, so trust me. 
[02:36:00]  Moab?  I had to land in Moab once.  That fucking airport's a joke, huh?  No shit, motherfucker.  I was supposed to go into Grand Junction, and it was frozen over, so I landed in Moab.  That was like a carrier deck.  Really?  Crazy.  It is.  Yeah.  It was exciting.  Were you scared?  Pissless.  And then had to rent a car and drive from Moab.  It's pretty cool, though.  I like that national fucking park out there, the Arches. 
[02:36:30]  No?  Arches and Canyonland.  You ever see that?  It's got that big fucking boulder up on that thing that looks like a golf tee.  Oh, yeah.  Those Arch Stantons?  Yeah.  Arch Stantons.  Balanced rock.  Balanced rock is what you're talking about.  Yes, I am.  Balanced rock.  Yeah, it's pretty fucking cold, thinking that's been there for quite some time.  Can you play guitar doing yoga?  All right.  Fuck, you guys.  Hey, I'm from New York.  I'm from upstate New York. 
[02:37:00]  Lake Placid.  Lake Placid?  Limp dick fucker.  That's why he finger-lakes.  Yes.  You guys need to stop camping out on the fucking Great Lawn, okay?  We've used that one.  We've been using that one over and over again.  I didn't hear what he said.  The Great Lawn.  We should stop what?  Camping where?  You're not allowed to be in such a park when the sun goes down.  I have camped in the Mojave Desert, my friend.  Whoa.  Way the fuck out from any road. 
[02:37:30]  With guns.  Not like that pussy Sal.  His friends tell him not to bring his gun.  Bring your cock and balls.  What?  It's all they needed.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We did great by you.  Thanks.  Yeah, and I did get lost in the woods when I went hiking in the upstate New York.  Well, not recently.  No, that was a while ago.  That's a while ago now.  I was starting our liaison.  Paul in Denver.  Huh?  Paul in Denver.  What's up?  Sure. 
[02:38:00]  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  My son-in-law is legally blind, and he and his brother take a week, and they go up into the  fucking Rockies as far as they can with very little food.  They hunt.  They fish.  And do some fucking hardcore fucking camping, man.  I don't know what this pussy Sal's talking about.  Legally blind, and they're doing all that?  Yeah.  Tell him.  I'm serious, man.  He's hardcore.  He's on the dirt pile with the air conditioner on.  What does legally blind mean?  Like, what can you actually say?  I don't know.  Legally blind is a very weird, vague term.  Right.  Because legally blind, you can still see shit, and then there's legally blind where you're 
[02:38:30]  totally blind.  Right.  Yeah.  Legally blind means that you're just basically an inconvenience.  Like, your eyes kind of suck, but you can kind of see.  Ah, it's terrible.  You don't get a dog, but like, all right, I'll help you.  Right.  What is that?  Is that my milk?  No.  It's a building.  Big, thick glasses.  It actually does IT, but he's got to, like, really get right up into the computer screen.  Oh, we might know one of those. 
[02:39:00]  Where they look at their watch, and it's like, whoa, the nose, bridging the nose right  against the watch.  Sam, we might know one of those, right?  Yep.  Oh.  Who's that?  No.  Oh, oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Thanks, boys.  Punch it out.  All right.  He's a good guy.  Yeah.  Do I know him?  Yes, you do.  Let's move on.  You know?  Let's just move on.  Ow.  I'm hurting myself.  Oh, God. 
[02:39:30]  That fucking dunderhead.  Hey, is that guy doing coke off the table?  No, he's reading the paper.  Oh.  Fucking face off.  They get glasses or any giggly-eyed idiot.  Make fucking Simpsons character eyes.  Get glasses.  Holy shit.  Would glasses help, you think?  I hope so.  Hey, Mike, Rob.  Two fucking glass topoggans on his face.  I said topoggans.  Topoggans.  I was on such a nice roll there.  Let's go to Sweden.  Oh.  Whoa.  Yes. 
[02:40:00]  This is nice.  We can't even get to Montreal.  Right?  Nah.  Maddie, it looks like.  I love your meatballs.  Swedish meatballs.  That's good.  I love your cocoa.  They're so tasty.  Exactly.  That's all we know.  That's what's sad.  Your tiny, shitty, sweet meatballs.  Your gummy bear fish.  I hate Swedish meatballs.  What's the capital?  Of Sweden?  What's up, guys?  Sri Lanka.  Denmark.  No, Sweden.  I don't know.  Hey, what's your name?  Matthew?  Matthew, yeah.  All right. 
[02:40:30]  Matthew?  That's Matthew.  What the fuck?  Matthew.  No, Matthew's English.  I'm from Scandinavia.  Yeah, but we have it.  Oh, Scandinavia.  We don't acknowledge that there's other ways to do this shit.  Are you a Viking?  No.  Do you have blonde hair and a battle axe?  Yeah, I got a battle axe.  What's her name?  The old battle axe.  Matthew's calling from Sweden.  How the hell are you a fan of this show?  It's getting strange having listeners around the world.  Been a fan for five, six years now. 
[02:41:00]  How did you find us?  Not through Sirius.  Not through Sirius.  Of course not.  YouTube, maybe?  Yeah.  No.  Not YouTube.  Torrent.  Chocolat?  Torrents.  A little Torrents action getting us fans around the world.  Nice.  Little Torrents.  So what's going on there, Maddy?  I want to show some love that you got a lot of listeners in Sweden.  In Sweden?  Yeah.  I like that.  You know what I like?  Swedish women.  Yes. 
[02:41:30]  Big bucks and blondes wearing lederhosen.  You actually helped me get laid, Anthony.  I did?  Yeah.  How did I manage that, sir?  I was drunk as a motherfucker watching you being drunk as a motherfucker on the show.  Oh, compound, right.  And my girlfriend's mom said, what the fuck are you watching?  I was just a Long Island asshole.  Funny and drunk. 
[02:42:00]  And then I spoke to my girlfriend and told me she would fuck me.  Oh, good.  I'm glad I could help.  Nice.  I'm sure the booze really did help a lot.  All right.  Yeah, we don't have much to talk about, I guess.  But that's good.  Yeah, that's cool.  It's nice to reach out around the globe with the Opie and Anthony program.  Right?  Just want to show some love.  Well, you're showing that love, just like Sal did with his man friends.  Yeah, he's a second week. 
[02:42:30]  Wow.  Wow, you guys are allowed to still say that word, huh?  From grasp of the English language.  Boy.  Yeah.  Use the F word.  Love you too, Jimmy.  Gay people.  Thank you, man.  All right.  Jimmy's going to do a tour abroad soon.  Maddie, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Touch it now.  I don't know what thank you is in Sweden.  We got a woman who's claiming she had an affair with Donald Sterling.  Should we take this call?  What?  Yeah, she's like a woman.  Might as well.  Who's this?  Hey, is this me, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, who is this?  You fucking cunts. 
[02:43:00]  The three of you are fucking on my shit list.  Why?  What happened?  Why, madam?  Yeah.  Because I, thanks to you three, I walk around like a goddamn Tourette's lunatic screaming  out weird news.  Weird news.  Weird news.  And then nobody else in my life listens to y'all, so I'm a fucking lunatic.  We'll fix that.  There's nobody in our lives either.  Say consolations.  That's true.  What?  Is that it?  You just wanted to get through by saying you had an affair? 
[02:43:30]  I had to make up something.  She lied.  Oh, boo.  You live in New Orleans?  I live in New Orleans, right downtown.  Were you ever punched in the face by black people?  No.  I was actually walking through the hood the other day thinking about it.  I'm on high alert now.  Yeah.  I think every white person gets punched in the face.  Well, we watched it on, actually, during the Mardi Gras.  We certainly saw it happen.  Yeah.  You know what the hell they're doing down here now?  It's a little local trend.  They're just running up to people on bikes with a baseball bat in their face. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, fuck.  No stealing, no nothing.  Just for, like, you know, knock-out game.  It's like some kind of a fucking monster movie.  It's crazy.  I can't believe I'm talking to y'all.  I can't either.  Right?  I love you guys.  Anthony, you're my favorite racist.  Ah.  I'm everybody's favorite racist, right?  It's a lovable character I'm trying to cultivate.  Trying? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I listen all day long.  Don't try harder.  Yeah.  Really?  Well, thank you, Alyssa.  Hey, punch you up, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  I've got to go pee.  Yeah, I've got to pee, too.  Bad.  Let's all go together.  One urinal, three cocks, big laughs.  Let's have our own camping trip.  Yeah.  We'll be right back.  I've got to bet something like that. 
[02:45:00]  I don't know if we really feel like doing it, but Pearl Jam.  Yeah.  Eddie Petter.  Uh-huh.  Sings the songs from Frozen.  Ah.  There you go. 
[02:45:30]  That whole let it grow.  Let it grow.  Let it grow.  Let it grow.  There you go.  We did it.  All right.  Hey, Trav.  Trav doll.  Did you watch your boyfriend last night?  No, I totally forgot about it.  Ah.  Of course not.  Did you?  What happened?  Was he good?  24.  Yeah, it was great.  How is he still alive, right?  Didn't he die in the...  No.  He did?  No, he left the country.  I thought...  He was a wanted terrorist.  Ah.  Ha, ha, ha.  You fat.  God, TV. 
[02:46:00]  You're a fruit.  Why am I a fruit?  Because I like...  I don't know.  You're in love with that guy.  All right, but that doesn't make me a fruit.  It does.  Because I like good television.  It kind of does.  24, huh?  But it's good.  It takes up...  Do you have to know all the frigging backstory from the...  Previous thing to get up in this?  Because how many episodes is it?  It's 12.  It's like 12.  And that's it?  That's it.  So I could watch this without having to frigging go back?  Yes.  And Bill Devane, the silver guy, is the president?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  I'm so psyched about that.  That's cool.  You know, his father told him to buy land, and he did. 
[02:46:30]  And he did very well for himself.  He did.  That's what he tells me.  That's a commercial.  So he tells me that while he's flying his planes, riding his motorcycles, his horses.  You know the guys that did really well doing that?  Yeah.  Aren't making commercials.  Probably not.  Right?  Why is Bill Devane hawking silver?  They're on a really nice yacht somewhere in the Mediterranean.  I guess they're not making commercials about it.  Bad news bears two royalty checks are drying up.  Right.  Well, I'm glad you had fun, because that's all I could think of, is how much you love  that man. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, it was great.  I do love that man.  How were the ratings?  Did they do all right?  I don't know.  I bet it did pretty good.  There was a buzz.  There was a buzz yesterday about it.  I bet it did pretty good.  Yeah, there was.  How long has it been off?  A little buzz.  Wow.  A long time.  Has it been?  Five years?  Yeah.  More than five years.  Wow.  No.  I was watching that in college.  Holy shit.  I remember videotaping it in college.  I'd never seen it.  Wait, the last season was over five years ago?  Yeah, definitely.  Holy crap.  You couldn't watch it live, because you were sucking cack?  No, okay.  The final episode was in 2010, so it's been four years.  Oh, four years. 
[02:47:30]  Close enough.  When was Lost?  When was the last episode of Lost?  Two years ago.  Yeah, that was just a couple years ago.  No, it's going to be more than that.  No, I would say at least three.  It debuted ten years ago.  Oh, the final episode was four years ago.  Four years ago.  24 and Lost ended at the same time.  Ended at the same time, and I had to talk you down off a bridge, I remember.  That's right.  You were going to kill yourself.  Lost really blew it.  I liked the last episode where the final season was.  The final season was so bad.  Just a filler.  Terrible costumes.  It was filler.  You didn't like the costumes?  Oh my God. 
[02:48:00]  I was like a child's planet of the apes set.  Fucking stunk.  Oh, by the big cave entrance.  Let's be guy.  Never saw an episode.  No?  It was really well written.  There was a lot of great stuff.  It doesn't have rewatchability, though.  I tried to get back into it.  Like, I watched the entire Sopranos over again about a year or so ago.  A little longer than that.  And just watched every episode again.  And complete rewatchability.  It's fantastic.  I think the experience of watching it outweighed the actual goodness of the show. 
[02:48:30]  I don't know if it outweighed, but it really helped.  No, I love the backstories and stuff.  Some of the writing was incredible.  I tried watching it again.  And that pilot episode is really good.  The first one.  That sucked everybody in.  The actual plane crash episode.  And then after that, I was just like, ugh, I can't be bothered.  It's also a show that you kind of have to watch in order.  Yeah.  You know, it's like, I can't just pop on a loss.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why it didn't do well.  When they were syndicating it, they were putting it on one of the channels for something. 
[02:49:00]  And it's like, how do you just pop in on season two, episode eight?  Yeah.  It didn't do well with syndication?  No.  I think it was on, like, sci-fi or something.  Yeah, yeah.  And they just pulled it.  You need to see all of them.  You need to see them in order.  Sopranos just did it.  Yeah, Sopranos were pretty self-contained.  You really didn't have to see all of them.  There was the main storylines.  Sure.  But then there was just kind of fun to watch those guys fucking around.  Those are Mafia men.  Yeah, Mafia guys.  The Mafia.  A bunch of Mafia men.  You want to feel really old?  I saw it in a magazine yesterday, Jurassic Park. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  How many years are we up to, do you think?  It's got to be 20.  21.  Because I remember that.  93.  It was a dinosaur.  I saw that right before I started doing the Opi Nighttime Attitude.  Oh.  I do remember that.  21 years ago.  And the last one was made, I think it went 93, 97.  I think the last one was 2001, right?  Okay.  That's the last one?  They're making another one, too.  So the last one's already 13 years old. 
[02:50:00]  They made a cool, they made it 3D, and I saw that like a year and a half ago on a date.  But it was not great in 3D.  What did he think?  He didn't care for you.  Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.  Hey, now.  What are you saying?  I'm saying.  You answered, though.  You answered, though.  I would never go on a date with a man if he had breasts and came over.  Well, so be it.  I'm a good host.  Okay.  It was just not...  They couldn't really put that together in 3D?  Yeah.  It was not meant to be 3D.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the new one?  Are they a remake, or is it just a new one?  No, it's a new one. 
[02:50:30]  Is Jeff Goldblum in it?  I don't know.  Did you...  Anyone go back and watch the original Jurassic Park and does the technology come close to  holding up or not really?  It's not that bad.  When you realize it's 21 years old, you're fucking stunned at how great the CGI is.  The giant like...  There's sores outside.  Right.  Their textures aren't very good in the shadowing, so it kind of looks flat.  Right.  But that fucking T-Rex is an amazing achievement of any film.  And our brains are stupid. 
[02:51:00]  Because back then, in 93, our brains didn't know any better, so we thought it was the most  amazing thing we've ever seen in our lives.  Well, I went the next day and saw it again.  I saw it...  Really?  Yeah.  And then I was just like, I gotta see that fucking movie again.  I remember that being like an event.  Yes.  Like, you were waiting outside the theater and you were hearing other people screaming  in the other theater.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, why am I watching this shit?  Yeah.  I could be in that theater watching a good movie.  It just got so weird, though, when the new one, they have the fucking dinosaurs are going  to be driving.  I just had nothing.  I don't really think that happened. 
[02:51:30]  I know.  I wish that joke didn't.  Oh, yeah.  It wasn't even a joke.  It was just words masquerading as a joke.  A dinosaur.  That was just a good movie.  Like, the whole thing.  Uh-uh.  Newman.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking Newman.  All right.  Uh-uh.  All right.  Wouldn't it be great if the whole new one now is just great CGI of pterodactyl shitting  on people's cars?  But fantastic CGI.  Newman's scene when he's having lunch with that guy to discuss the deal about stealing 
[02:52:00]  the embryos and stuff.  When he looks down at the check, like, you pay this, it's such a great Newman moment.  Don't get cheap on me.  What a great fucking dopey character.  And, uh, and, uh, fucking, uh, who else was in that?  Samuel Jackson.  Samuel Jackson.  That's right.  Samuel Jackson.  Motherfucker.  Smoking a cigarette down to the filter.  Yeah, that was a good movie. 
[02:52:30]  It was good.  It holds up.  It does hold up.  Anyway.  I give it, uh, four stars going out on a limb.  Friends ended 10 years ago today.  Oh.  That was a quick 10.  Let's watch Friends and then we'll watch General Hospital and Days of Our Lives and then you  can drive Jennifer.  Oh, would you like that?  No.  It's the only reason I'm bringing it up.  Oh.  I'd go, I would go upstairs and you, you had to sit there. 
[02:53:00]  I would even try to get you out of the house.  I'm like, let's go just, let's just go do something.  I couldn't.  I had to.  You weren't allowed to leave.  I wasn't allowed.  I had to watch Friends.  I laugh, I laugh hard because the old version of you and the new version is like.  Pause, pause, pause it, Jennifer.  Pause it.  So, Anthony, I can tell him what happens to Joey.  Let's play Time Machine.  I like playing Time Machine on the show every once in a while.  So, you take the current version of you. 
[02:53:30]  Uh-huh.  You're back in your mother-in-law's house up there in, uh, where the hell?  Ashland.  Ashland, right.  In that basement.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you have to sit through these two, three shows before you were allowed to go home after  working.  Yes.  Because even though this is radio, it is, it is working.  Okay, sure.  So, now it's the current Anthony.  What would you do?  All right.  Right.  Now, all of a sudden, I'm in the living room.  Yeah.  At the townhouse.  And I hear friends on downstairs.  Yeah.  And I hear, I hear Judy talking to Jennifer. 
[02:54:00]  And I hear me, like, clinking my glass of Captain and Coke to get through this night.  And I walk down the stairs.  And I see all of us right down there.  Right.  And I am so confused, because I don't know who to punch in the face first.  Judy, Jennifer, or my old self.  Oh, you're off me out of it.  Thank you.  I have no clue who to belt in the face first or harder.  Oh, man.  And it was just...  I would clunk all three heads together like the three stooges. 
[02:54:30]  And it was just a sad basement.  It was.  The 70s.  Not sad, but there was...  It was just...  Yeah, depressing.  I would probably take my current self, go back to that situation, and go for a taste.  Yeah.  With the mother-in-law.  Ew!  I'd go in for a little taste.  How old was she?  She always had a little thing for me.  I don't know.  Wow.  How old was she?  I think she wanted to ride the Obster's Prick. 
[02:55:00]  She didn't get rid of my part of the poster.  Only Anthony's.  I would...  I know.  I think I'd work very...  It was your brother-in-law, and she cut you out of the poster.  And she cut me out of the poster.  Why?  Forget me, Phil.  She didn't want to look at my fucking mug while I was, you know, cheating on her wonderful  daughter.  Oh, that was when things went bad?  Uh, yeah.  I don't know.  After things went awry.  I don't know how she was.  I'm trying to think.  I would, you know...  I'm trying to draw the ages here, so...  I know what I would do. 
[02:55:30]  I would work my darndest, hardest, calling in all favors, paying whatever I would have  to pay to get the lovely Jennifer a job at Windows on the World.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, wow.  What?  Wow.  That would be...  Oh.  It looks like a nice enough morning.  Have fun, dear.  I'll see you later.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  What a lovely fall day.  Oh, my God. 
[02:56:00]  Let's not be late now.  Yes, hurry up.  Don't be late.  I might take the later, but no.  No, do not.  You have to be there before nine.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Breakfast shift it is.  Yeah.  I'm going to run down and get something to eat.  No, no, no.  I'll bring it up to you.  I'll bring it up.  Yes, all the way to the 110th floor, please.  And, of course, my ex would have had a driver, because...  Of course.  Oh, well, you know, that could work.  Maybe a good bump on the head on the way out.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[02:56:30]  Wow.  It's terrible, but...  That one...  Wow.  That one made me a little uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Which is very rare.  Let's say hi to Kyle in Alabama.  Hey, Kay.  Kyle.  Hey, Kay.  Hey, Kay.  I heard a rumor, and Bradley Cooper's apparently going to be playing Chris Kyle in 2015.  Yeah.  And he was, you know, he's all buffed up and got all of whatever.  And he was...  In one of the interviews I'm trying to...  I guess it was an EW interview.  But anyway, he was talking about how his life and how amazing it was. 
[02:57:00]  And then he was talking about the amazing, you know, revelation on the O'Reilly show  about with Jesse Ventura and their chronicling his life.  But, you know, I'm a fan of y'all, but correct me if I'm wrong.  Didn't he bring that up first on y'all's show?  Of course he did.  Or have y'all been playing for the movie?  No.  No, we get fucked.  We get fucked.  We get fucked all the time.  Well, there's no one to push the story out, so O'Reilly just ran with it.  And, yeah.  O'Reilly got it.  But I don't know if he knew...  We knew. 
[02:57:30]  I don't know if O'Reilly knew.  But the fact is, he told us first.  We said...  It was said on this show first, but then it just stays there.  It doesn't go anywhere because there's no one to push it out.  So when O'Reilly, first of all, he's on TV and he's a very famous guy.  So all these hours later, people are still hearing it for the first time unless they're  fans of the show.  Right.  Okay.  So it's almost like just a lack of, I guess, people pushing the O'Reilly show out.  Because I swear, that's what I heard on the show.  That was a big deal.  We're already going to be in three movies, so we're good. 
[02:58:00]  Okay.  We got the Rich Voss movie.  That's coming out soon, finally.  We got the Chris Rock movie, which I don't know what's going on with that.  I saw him last night.  Is there anything going on with that movie?  He was shooting last night outside the conference room.  Oh, they're back shooting.  He was doing an external shot.  So we might be in the Chris Rock movie for, if I had to guess, I would say 15 seconds.  But it still wasn't a Chris Rock movie.  I saw him not long before that.  And we were just talking.  And I'm like, you know, how's the movie going?  And he's like, it's going to go. 
[02:58:30]  He goes, you're still in it.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  So if you're in it, that means we're in it.  Don't forget Kevin Pollack.  That was the third one.  Oh, was that the third one you were going to?  This was my bit.  Ah!  That's my bit.  If this is all I've got to offer, I've really got to leave now forever.  This is my bit.  No, and then Kevin Pollack contacted all of us and we made the final cut of his movie.  Yes.  Which is a look at comedians and comedy.  And what makes things funny.  What makes things funny.  Right. 
[02:59:00]  What makes people funny.  We had fun.  What I want from him, we shot for all three of us for, how long was that?  Half hour at least, 40 minutes maybe?  And he's only going to use, if we're in the movie two minutes, that would be a lot, I think.  Two, three minutes.  Because it's going to be bounced around with a whole bunch of guys.  Yeah.  But I want him to give us that footage so we can put it somewhere.  Mm-hmm.  That long forearm interview he did with us was really a lot of fun.  Yeah.  And it's on film, that would look cool. 
[02:59:30]  That would be a nice birthday present, Kevin Pollack.  Wow.  I know you're listening.  Jesus.  That was great.  After the movie comes out, I get it.  But then you've got to give us that.  That would be huge.  Some old lady apartment.  Yeah, wasn't that creepy?  That rain was so bad.  It was a fucking...  Oh, it was pouring when we left.  It was a biblical downpour.  And I couldn't get a cab because it's in that little back area.  What's it called?  Sutton?  It was a weird road.  It didn't feel like it was in New York City because it was so quiet.  What's that called?  That's an area.  Kissinger used to live up there. 
[03:00:00]  Is that Sutton Place?  I don't know that part of the city.  I called it Jewville.  It's this own little unique neighborhood.  It's like you don't see a lot of cabs or cars in general going through there.  Sutton Place.  Sutton Place, okay.  My Uber wouldn't work.  I couldn't sign up my Uber.  I was so angry.  Sutton Place or something?  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  You're nuts.  All right, Kyle.  Thank you.  Hey, real quick.  Can I ask you a question about Louie last night?  Sure.  You know, we were just talking about this in the hall with Ron Bennington. 
[03:00:30]  I forgot that the Louie episodes were finally on the air.  Right.  What did everyone think?  Funny.  Did you like it, Kyle?  I actually did.  I did laugh out loud at the beginning of the trash.  That fucking garbage truck scene is hilarious.  No, I was going to ask about with Sarah Silverman.  I know she knows you as a comic.  Is there any...  Does she even bring up the fact that you're on the show or that she skips out on or anything  like that?  Or does she just...  Are you all purely comic friends or just acquaintances?  We've been friends for a long, long time. 
[03:01:00]  I know Sarah for, you know, maybe 17 years or so.  Yeah, bro.  Since the mid or late 90s.  And, you know, she would always do...  We never talked about the show.  I mean, she did the O&A show years ago in, like, 2001 after that Conan chink thing.  Remember she was having all the things?  Because she said, like, shit chink on Conan or something like that.  We had a good time with her.  Yeah, yeah.  She was great.  And then recently she came in the building, but she didn't do our show.  But she was only doing press with a friend for something else. 
[03:01:30]  And so we walked out and I saw her.  And apparently she waved to me.  And I, in all honesty, didn't see her.  But she thought that I saw her and just didn't wave back.  So she's like, wow, what's going on with Jim?  Oh, shit.  So she emailed me and she's like, look, what's...  You know, I wasn't trying to be whatever.  I was just with my friend and it wasn't...  So I wrote her back and I was like, I truly didn't see you.  Now, there's no bad blood at all.  Right.  With this.  I mean, I like her a lot, actually.  I mean, she's truly funny.  Why don't you shut up before I come over there and try to fuck start your face? 
[03:02:00]  That's great.  Jeez.  It was at the beginning of...  What was that one?  I don't know.  That movie where she then gets punched in the fucking face.  She said it or someone else did?  No.  Someone else said it to Sarah Silverman.  Oh.  Yeah.  What was it?  Way of the Gun?  Was it Way of the Gun?  I don't know.  Way of the Gun.  Thank you, Mike the Marine.  What a great intro that was.  You ever see that?  Put opening of Way of the Gun or Sarah Silverman Way of the Gun. 
[03:02:30]  You've got to see this scene.  It's fucking classic.  Kyle, we're going to let you go, all right?  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  Thanks, buddy.  All right.  Okay.  You found it?  Wait, which two episodes were Louie?  It was the garbage can one?  Uh-uh-uh.  Yeah.  Sarah Silverman.  She's good in this, man.  I can't see it.  Oh, man.  They're outside a big bar.  Big, tough-looking bar, right?  Oh, boy. 
[03:03:00]  What's that?  Carrots up?  That's Dee Snider.  Red afro.  Awful.  And is that Sarah to the right?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, you.  Get up.  They're leaning on his car.  You're tarted?  Get off the fucking car.  Can't say retarded anymore.  Hey, Dickless.  Get off the fucking car.  You can say Dickless, too.  She's hilarious.  Hey, fucksuck. 
[03:03:30]  Get your slippery fucking ass off the car.  Listen to me.  Get off the fucking car with your fucking ass.  Shut that cunt's mouth or I'll come over there and fuck start her head.  It's almost a laughing.  Do something.  Do something.  Yeah, now the boyfriend is obligated to do something.  A lot of them.  Yeah, you fucking got up this morning, asshole, because my boyfriend's gonna fuck you up.  And then after that, while he's fucking up your fucking gay uncle over there, I'm gonna 
[03:04:00]  fucking cut off your cock and mail it to your mother, you fucking faggot bitch.  Gaylord fucking bitch.  How do you like that?  Do you like that a lot?  It's benicio.  You fucking faggot?  You like to ass fuck?  Fontanella fucking baby head fuck?  You like to fuck baby heads?  You like to fuck boys?  He's gonna fuck you in the ass.  How do you like that?  He's not even gay, but he'll do it.  Just to fuck you.  Honey?  She's got a big mouth, but she's not kidding.  I'm gonna whip you silly, and I'm gonna fuck you stupid. 
[03:04:30]  You wanna do the man dance?  First dance is yours.  He just pushes him away and punches Sarah right in the face.  Full blast punch in the face.  Back to the fucking stone.  What year is this?  Way of the gun.  This is probably shit.  Over ten years old, right?  This is very funny.  Yeah, it's a good one.  Who was the other guy with Benicio Del Toro?  Yeah, he's a familiar...  That was Ryan Phillippe.  Oh, he wasn't?  It's a good movie.  I've never seen this.  Crash, okay.  A fun movie.  That's really funny. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, but didn't she know she's gonna get her boyfriend in trouble?  Oh, girls don't know that shit.  They'll open their dumb fuck yaps and get guys in trouble consistently.  Like fucking baby heads, you faggot?  Baby heads?  You like fucking baby heads?  Oh, could you imagine a chick doing that?  And you just gotta be like, now...  What do you mean imagine?  Well, a lot of us have been in that situation.  The movie, I remember.  I was there.  Oh, boy.  I was there when that one happened.  No, shut the fuck up.  Yeah, you got your girl, she pipes up, and next thing you know, you got problems.  Like, fuck. 
[03:05:30]  Some guys are cool, and they'll give you like the...  Yeah, I understand.  They'll look at you like, I've been there too.  I know, dude.  Let's just not fucking...  Right.  Get into this, but some guys, uh...  Battle mode.  That was it.  Have all the luck.  Some guys have...  Some...  I hate when girlfriends try to be funny, make fun of people, but they're too dumb and loud  to do it right.  Like, you guys come in like...  There's no sarcasm.  Yeah, they'll just say, like, look at him limping.  It's like, hey, stupid, we all heard you.  Because they don't know how to whisper and talk shit. 
[03:06:00]  Right.  Right.  Yeah, and then the guy turns around like, what?  You gotta look like, yeah, she's a fucking dumb car.  Nah, what am I gonna do?  You just punch her in the face.  Let the guy see.  She takes my cheese.  There.  See?  I punched her.  Which Louis episodes were last night?  The garbage truck.  Yeah, the poker scene.  One and two, yeah.  The poker scene with Jimmy, which was great.  And the vibrator, right?  Okay, the whole vibrating thing.  And, uh...  And then the Jerry.  Oh, Charles Grodin.  Uh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Was he in that first episode?  I believe so, right?  Because Louis throws out his back, then he goes and sees Charles Grodin. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, that was great.  And then the Seinfeld was last night?  Yeah, the Seinfeld one was last night.  Yeah.  Oh, then the third one is the fat girl, and then the fourth one is the, uh...  The elevator thing.  Louis.  Okay.  Oh, right on.  Yeah, good start for Louis.  Yeah.  Well, that was, uh...  Fucking Jerry.  Well, that was, uh, horrible.  Right.  Poor Louis.  Anyway.  Wow.  I got turned on to some, um... 
[03:07:00]  Some Yiddish rock because of Louis.  Yiddish rock.  Yeah.  There's a band he's using in this season.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, it's called Gollum Rocks.  Oh, yeah?  And, coincidentally, I know the mom of the band.  What?  I don't...  It was the weirdest thing yesterday.  You know the elevator episode, and they start playing that, like, that strange, like,  Eastern, like, kind of Yiddish-y music. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It turns out it's a band called Gollum Rocks, and the mom, uh, her kid goes to the same  school as my kid.  Oh, hey!  And she knows what I do for a living, and then she just, out of nowhere, says, yeah.  You know what I do for a living?  She goes, I'm, uh, my band's gonna be featured on Louis this season.  I'm like, what?  I didn't even...  I barely knew her.  I didn't even know she was a musician.  And it turns out it was that music they were playing when, uh, in that scene.  Ah, wow.  Okay. 
[03:08:00]  And it's, uh...  How did Louis find it?  I don't know.  That's why I bring it up.  It's the strangest, weirdest thing.  Yeah, you wouldn't normally just go, yeah, I think this scene needs this.  It's Yiddish.  It's like Yiddish.  There's an accordion.  There's, like, punk music.  There's...  Go to Gollum Rocks.  I don't even know if this matters to people, but...  I think it's Gollum and their website.  Does it say Gollum Rocks?  It's GollumRocks.com.  Oh, okay, because someone else got the...  Yeah, someone else got the big...  Gollum?  G-O-L-E-M. 
[03:08:30]  You have to separate yourself from the actual Gollum, so I got it.  So the band's name...  The band's name is Gollum.  They're from Brooklyn.  They play the fucking world.  Yeah, go down to music.  I also told her I would give her a little plug today.  They're really strange.  They got, like, a...  Go to I'm a Snake.  I don't even know if anyone would like this, but...  Roll the tape!  But Louis is playing it on his, um...  His type of shit.  Violins, accordions. 
[03:09:00]  It sounds like the music, like, in the Emanuel movies, when they're on the fucking back of a motorcycle in Vietnam.  Yes!  It's background music.  It's good, though.  It's like a movie.  So she told me she's on Louis, and she gives me the sticker with the band name.  And how many times have we been in that situation?  Like, ugh, ugh.  Yeah. 
[03:09:30]  And then I went home, and I looked it up, and I'm like, I think I like this.  Wow, that's weird music.  Strange, right?  What's she saying?  I don't know.  It's really weird.  Throw rocks at the Palestinians.  Build more houses, fuck them.  Build more houses, fuck them.  Fred Reed bust, they ruined.  We should drop a lot of bombs on them.  Bombs on them. 
[03:10:00]  Build more houses, fuck them.  This is good.  Is it all right?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't get it.  Devil went down to Georgia.  He was looking for a soul to steal.  He was in a bind.  We're way behind.  We're willing to make a deal.  No?  I'm not even sure if this was the actual song that Louie used.  I'm not positive.  I got to go look.  It's kind of like the monster mash that's strapping on the... 
[03:10:30]  I got to go back and watch the episode and figure out what song he ended up using.  Yeah.  But they're called Gollum.  You ever see those Jewish guys that play Hotel California?  No.  Yeah, it was some kind of viral thing on Facebook.  Yeah.  They were playing a bunch of Jewish, like, Hasidic guys.  Pass.  You see those Jewish guys that do Beastie Boys songs?  No. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, the Beastie Boys?  Hasidic Jews.  Hotel California.  Let me say hi to Andy in Cleveland.  Andy.  There they are.  Question.  Is it Gollum as in, like, the Tolkien Gollum, or is it Gollum as in G-O-L-E-M as the Jewish character?  Gollum?  It's, well, awkward.  I think it's G-O-L-E-M, so how would you pronounce that? 
[03:11:30]  Gollum.  That's Gollum.  Gollum.  Yeah, Gollum.  Gollum is the name of it.  Did you like that or not?  Because I didn't even know if I should have brought it to the show.  It was just such a strange coincidence.  And then with the Louis angle, I'm like, and then I listened and I said, man, I kind of  like this.  Did you like it, Andy, or no?  It's never a good time to listen to music through the phone.  Yeah, that's true.  You know, it seemed interesting.  I couldn't tell if it was a horn or her singing, but, yeah.  All right.  A little much.  It's Gollum, G-O-L-E-M.  And their website is Gollum Rocks, G-O-L-E-M, rocks.com. 
[03:12:00]  You've got to check these guys out.  Yeah, let's see this now.  The amazing rabbis singing Hotel California.  Oh, yeah.  And they are legit.  They're, um...  Are they actual rabbis?  I guess they are.  They sure look the part of me.  Or they're just wearing the hat.  The hat!  We're getting a deal at the Hotel California.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Where do they perform this? 
[03:12:30]  On an Israeli TV show.  God, this show just got really weird.  Marzuzza and I walk right in.  Oh, there he is.  My beard.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  So eight shimmering lights.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh.  Mean people call us? 
[03:13:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Mission bell.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  People say, since I deny Christ, I'm going to burn in hell.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Then she lit up the candle.  And she showed me the way.  This is good.  There they go.  Yeah.  I thought I'd hear them say.  Welcome to the Hotel California. 
[03:13:30]  Oh.  Such a lovely place.  Such a lovely place.  Such a lovely place.  Mm, it's a...  Once you're through, man, the hotel, California.  California.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What kind of show is this?  I don't know.  It's some kind of American Idol.  Some meters going up on the left side.  58% thing.  And they have to beat, like, the percentage that the last band got.  And then when they do, this whole big thing happens.  And look at him fucking playing that lead, though. 
[03:14:00]  This Jewish guy is rocking and rolling.  Yeah.  I don't get this.  This little Star Trek emblems.  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  There it goes.  That's good.  Now the thing comes up.  And they're in front of the crowd.  And I don't know.  But you see the timing of when they beat the other guy?  I know.  It's perfect.  That part of the song where it really just kicks in and builds.  Yep.  Everything's so fucking predictable. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Although rabbis singing Hotel California I wouldn't have seen coming.  That's probably not as predictable.  Yeah, you're right.  Very cool.  I mean.  I like the fact they're playing it out.  They are.  A little double lead going on there.  Joe Walsh-steen.  Didn't I cut some of this stuff out? 
[03:15:00]  Did they?  There's more words or no?  They cut some of the song out.  Yeah.  Shorter version.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, maybe not.  I like that part.  Check out my pace.  They are real Jewish, man.  Look at that.  That is a classic profile. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  Oh, they cut a lot of it out.  They're stamping it with those stealing knives.  Ah, well.  Yes.  Ah, well.  Yeah.  What's that?  Kosher?  Say hi to Jay and Nyack.  Jay.  Ah, guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I know the show has changed over the years, but when Jimmy Chyzen said, this is  good, Jimmy Norton.  I mean, come on.  Are these guys jumping around in, like, concentration camp uniforms or something? 
[03:16:00]  Oh, boy.  Wow.  That was pretty fun.  That was a good one.  It's not that the show has changed.  I just, I thought it was a cool, different version.  How is that different?  Oh, and the other song, too, I think you said.  What?  The one I played.  I would ever want to, like, just disagree with, because, you know, we come from the same  place.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, my God.  It's my father's bag.  My mother's content.  I miss your advice show so much.  Thank you.  All right. 
[03:16:30]  What's that?  I didn't hear you said.  How can I get your advice show back on the channel?  It's up to Tim Sabian.  It's not up to me.  Yeah, he's sitting on it.  Yeah, he's really good.  He's sitting on it.  Yeah.  And, you know, I'm just messing around, but you know what?  When I see you guys talking about this Gollum Rocks and stuff, I'm like, wow, what  happened to the Whiffle Bowl back challenges?  What happened to the Whiffle Bowl?  Oh, boy.  Dude, it's five fucking lousy minutes of what we call kind of throwaway radio at the end  of the show.  Relax.  Did you enjoy the Seth Rogen interview today, which was an hour of amazing radio? 
[03:17:00]  Oh, no.  No, no.  It's the last five minutes.  But you guys are starting to get exhausting.  It's five minutes of truly just throwaway radio.  This is clean up time in art class.  It's when you have to clean up the pace and put things away.  How about you talk about how great the Seth Rogen segment was?  It was amazing today.  We could have went home after that.  He was so damn good.  Let's say hi to Joe in Philly.  Joe! 
[03:17:30]  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I'm glad that last caller lowered the bar for me.  All right.  I was sitting watching the new episode of Lily last night, fresh off a ball with my wife.  It wouldn't have fun.  You're going to shit?  Yeah.  It wouldn't have fun even took the shit off.  And I took a sip of my beer.  And when Sarah Silverman asked Jimmy if he comes from a vibrator, I spit beer all over  my infant son.  Oh.  My infant son.  That'll happen.  Yeah, you know.  Sure. 
[03:18:00]  The worst part is he just fell asleep because he's suffering from a bacterial infection  called thrush.  Oh.  Heard about that.  I heard about that one.  What is that?  It looks like cum mouth.  Oh, God.  What do you do?  Jesus.  I know.  I'm just calling it like I said.  I mean, I don't like that myself.  You're a terrible person.  All right.  Yeah, you know.  All right.  Nah, what are you going to do?  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  Joe.  Thank you.  Let's go to Bart in Jersey.  Bart.  Hey, yeah. 
[03:18:30]  Thanks.  I just want to say great show today.  Let me know.  It was awesome.  And I love the music at the end.  Oh.  That was very nice.  I like the Hotel California.  I wasn't a big fan of that other stuff.  That other stuff scared you?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I couldn't listen to it.  Like, I wouldn't drive home listening to a...  Yeah.  I like that different weird sound, though, sometimes.  I love a good cover, as I've said before.  Yeah. 
[03:19:00]  There's plenty of room at those kind of...  The Hotel California.  I like the way they said the plenty of room.  Plenty of room.  My accountant, Barry...  Not Barry.  It's your guy.  It's...  Oh, my God.  My can't fucking...  Oh, it is Barry.  I have a Barry guy.  Yeah.  It's not Barry.  It's full of.  It's full of.  You have to get a Barry if you want someone to look after you.  But he talks like that.  He's a Jewish guy.  Yeah.  And Jim, we have to do the...  It's like he's doing...  Isn't that weird?  There's like this weird inflection and cadence that goes along with...  Reminds me of him. 
[03:19:30]  ...certain nationalities.  Yeah.  Ethnicities or cultural religions, whatever it is.  I'm looking into that through experimentation with a retinal dye.  Really?  It was terrible.  Yeah.  Doing twins.  It's just got to end terribly every time we question things.  Humans stink.  You think so?  Yes.  We're just awful things on this planet.  I'd love to see what makes people tick.  You can't be twins.  Yes.  Exactly.  That fucking whole country should have been nuked. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  I'm telling you, in the World War II, the whole country should have been nuked.  Well, there's some surrounding areas.  Too many of them were signing off on it.  They should have been nuked out of existence.  Well, with that, we're going to go home.  Now, take that home with you.  Really?  We can't follow that.  All right.  Once again, thanks to Seth Rogen.  He was just fucking great for us today.  Make sure you listen to the replay.  If you didn't hear it, he really just hit it out of the park.  And his new movie, Neighbors, starts Friday.

[03:22:30]  Welcome to the OPI and Anthony Post Show.  I'm the guy he was talking about.  Sam Roberts.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  If you want to be a part of the Post Show.  866-969-1969.  Breaking down everything that happened today on the OPI and Anthony show.  Sal became a point of conversation today.  I knew your camping trip would eventually come up on the show.  Yeah, I had a feeling too. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, I mean, if you had heard that E-Rock was going on an all-guys camping trip.  Yeah.  Would you probably bring that up in a point of what the fuck is he doing?  Absolutely.  So what motivated you to make the leap?  Because you said at first you'd never been camping.  Yeah, my friends always ask me to go.  Like, we do a lot of hiking and biking and all that sort of shit.  But, like, I've never gone, like, camping.  Because I like to wake up, take a shower, you know, relax.  Be a person.  Yeah.  And then they were like, why don't you do it? 
[03:23:30]  And I was like, you know what, fuck it.  Just, why not try something and be out of your element and give it, you know.  How often do your friends go camping?  They haven't gone in, like, over, like, a year and a half.  Oh, okay.  So it's not like they go camping every two months and you keep turning them down.  No, no, no, no.  It's kind of like we usually just, we usually bike or hike and that sort of stuff.  Like, there's this one hike we do almost, like, once a month and it's fucking awesome.  Hmm.  Yeah.  There's no worry about, well, what happens in these tents, guys?  Are they effeminate guys?  No.  The masculine men.  They're definitely, I will openly admit they're more masculine than me. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, so they must have liked you.  Yeah.  They need to bring Sal along next time.  Yeah.  You're like that prison MVP.  I was like the mule for them.  I was carrying all their weight and shit, you know.  Oh, I'll bet you were.  They were packing you full, huh?  So many innuendos.  It's ridiculous.  All of them were sick of being the bottoms.  They were like, let's just convince Sal to go and give bottom for all of us.  Exactly.  Can grow out?  That's cool.  That's a little attention.  That's very fun.  Yeah, I mean, and we weren't doing anything, like, extreme and badass.  It was just a hike and we camped.  That's all it was.  Yeah, just fucking buttholes. 
[03:24:30]  Just, you know, hanging.  No problem. </pre>
