<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The After Opie and Anthony show, hosted by Sam Roberts, heavily featured Mars, the show's engineer, and his attempts to bond with Opie. Mars recounted multiple failed attempts, including an incident where lending Opie his ID resulted in Mars being locked out of the building.  His interactions with Anthony were described as more formal.  A significant portion revolved around workplace behavior, specifically Eric's office napping, hilariously documented in a secretly filmed video by Roland showing Eric's deep sleep and subsequent awakening.  The upcoming company barbecue was discussed, with Mars hoping to secure lunch using Opie's money, a request ultimately denied.  The conversation included comments about show staff, including an offensive comment by Mars about Hispanic people, and frequent use of offensive language overall.  Spanky Frank, an intern, was mentioned in relation to a fistula.  Joe DeRosa's previous experience with the show's on-air/off-air dynamic was contrasted with Sam's own reaction.  Finally, Eric announced he had a date, Justin Stengel, for the barbecue.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  I have to tell you that we're on the air, we're off the air bit.  It just gets me every time.  Not gets me as in tricks me, but makes me laugh every time.  It's never not funny.  And I don't care what Joe DeRosa said.  He made it seem like whether we're on the air or not, I don't feel stupid.  He felt stupid because it's just, I mean, it's ridiculous.  You leave the show, you say goodbye, you're, you know, you're, you're,  and then you realize you're still on the air.  It's always funny. 
[00:00:30]  This is after Opie and Anthony live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  As always, Mars was just harassing one of the Ron and Fez interns.  Mars, you're not supposed to be, we had the, you were on the air earlier today  talking about not only what you came out, actually it was right here on the after show  that you dropped the bombshell.  And it's been a theme ever since you said it right here on the after show on ONA  talking about Hispanic people touching kids and their families.  First of all, I got permission to touch him. 
[00:01:00]  And this is, what's your, what's your name, intern name, on air name?  I don't know.  What do they call you?  I'm Spanky Frank.  Spanky Frank?  Yes, sir.  That's a great name.  Spanky Frank gave me permission to touch this.  Okay.  Okay.  I don't know where we're going because you understand before you say anything else.  Yes, sir.  There are some things that because he's an intern, even if he gives you permission, it's  not appropriate touch.  Even if he tells me to touch me and there's a forearm?  Forearm.  Okay.  I thought, okay.  Forearm is, I guess that's fine. 
[00:01:30]  But what is it again?  Spanky Frank.  Spanky Frank.  Spanky Frank has these, um...  See, he's got raises in his arm.  Like, his arm, it almost, to me, it looks like he has those silicone plastic implants  under his skin.  Like the snake guy?  Yeah, they put him in their head.  Forehead, yeah.  But lots of...  And people put him in their arms and stuff.  It's done.  I mean, Spanky Frank didn't look like the type of person that might...  But he could.  I'm not here to judge. 
[00:02:00]  So before you came in here...  Right.  How did you ask?  I said, hey, so what?  Do you have...  Are those those skin implants or is it something else?  And he was like, oh, no, actually, it's something else, blah, blah, blah.  It's a fistula.  That's what it's called, right?  Yep, absolutely.  And he was explaining.  I go, oh, okay.  I just, you know, I explained the whole thing.  Because I knew that if it was, it could be a medical issue.  And it could be something serious.  You don't know what it is.  If it's something serious, if it's something he's embarrassed about.  Although if it's something you're embarrassed about, I would assume you'd wear long sleeves. 
[00:02:30]  Absolutely.  Kind of got that covered.  Mars, on the other hand, I walk in here and Mars looks at this poor young intern and goes,  yo, what's up with your forearm?  I said, okay.  I mean, I guess that's a different way to phrase the same question.  And then he...  You're not a tactful guy, Mars.  Well, I got the answer.  I got the response quickly.  And he even had me...  He invited me to touch him.  Well, he invited me to touch him, too.  You know what I said?  You didn't touch him?  I said, no, thank you.  Oh, you're a puss.  Because you know why? 
[00:03:00]  If you touch that, you actually feel the blood.  Just the...  Is that what it is?  That's the pulse.  Yeah, the pulse.  You want to feel, Sam?  No.  I talked to you about it.  It's weird.  I'm not going to.  It's weird as hell.  Go ahead.  I believe it's weird.  I trust your words in that.  But, E-Rock, you said from your vantage point it looked like an inappropriate touch.  Well, again, I'm setting up for this show and I look over and Mars is just kind of petting  this guy's arm.  I'm like, what the hell is going on?  Well, I don't know if Travis is still here or not.  I know that he was going on an errand with some of the bosses. 
[00:03:30]  By the way, I still have the KFC money, which if you were listening on the air, Obie said  to get lunch for the boys.  Now, to me, that means, you know, treat the staff to lunch.  Eric?  Yeah?  Would you like me to pay for your lunch today?  I would love nothing more.  Roland?  Well, I don't know.  Roland's like the whole hundred.  Roland, I might be getting you lunch today.  Cranius.  What's that?  What?  Is this about Blake Shelton?  What's the great news?  I'll talk about Blake Shelton in a minute, Eric. 
[00:04:00]  We're going to definitely, because we didn't get to it yesterday, we'll get to it today.  My favorite coffee place, only California, coffee being Teen Leaf, is coming to New York.  1412 Broadway at 39th Street.  And that's going to be the place to be for coffee.  Dude, it's the bitch.  I mean, it'll make Starbucks look like a little bitch.  It's so good.  I got Opie and Anthony's $100 for the KFC thing.  So, you want me to get you some lunch today?  Bitch, sweet tits.  Mars, you understand that you drew. 
[00:04:30]  It's only fair.  Out of the hat, you pulled a piece of paper.  Oh, same rules.  Same rules.  That said you get nothing.  You get nothing.  That also includes the free barbecue at 1 o'clock.  You won't.  Well, I'll talk about that in a minute, too.  That was a bit.  You won't be getting lunch.  This is real now.  Right.  You won't be getting lunch with the money either.  He said take care of the boys.  I'm one of the boys.  Okay, Roland's drinking.  Somebody left the whiskey bottle that Joe DeRosa requested, and Roland just took a hit off of it. 
[00:05:00]  I did not.  Enjoy yourself, Roland.  I didn't see that, Roland.  I didn't see that, Roland.  Curtains are open.  Another shot.  No, no.  Jesus.  Nothing's going on.  That's it.  Keep going.  How is that, Roland?  Mother's milk.  I didn't realize we were going to have a drunk show here on the after show.  But, Mars, you understand.  I won't be getting you any lunch.  I'll be taking this up with Opie.  You can.  I mean, but you drew it fair as fair.  Hey, Sam, don't worry.  He doesn't have his number.  That's true.  And, by the way.  Want me to get Opie on the phone now?  No. 
[00:05:30]  You know what?  Let him have his morning.  He's filming a video, and Mars can't call him, so.  Why can't I call him?  Because you don't have his phone number.  Damn.  Right.  That's right.  You can Twitter him.  Although, Mars, I will say that I noticed this morning.  Yes, sir.  Before the show started, he was going to get his own.  He said, I'm here early.  I want to go for a walk.  I'm going to get some Starbucks.  Yeah, Mars, follow him.  And he goes, anybody want to go for a walk?  I was like, I don't need coffee.  Nobody.  He was like, Mars, you want to go?  Mars goes, yeah, sure. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you.  He's going to buy them like a frappuccino.  Next thing I know, Ant calls Mars over for a second, just asking him a question about  some of his equipment.  And, uh, Mars.  What's going on in there?  You hear that, right, Mars?  Eric, what's going on in there?  Answering the phones.  How did I tell you?  I asked you to answer the phones in a specific way.  You did?  Remember, I said when that phone in there rings, put it on speaker and say, hi, this is it.  Oh, no, no, no.  This wasn't the office phone.  This is the phone lines for the show.  Oh, oh, oh, okay.  That's what I was asking.  Oh, okay, sorry. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, hold on.  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  Okay, whatever.  And so, uh, Club Soda Kenny was with Opie, actually.  So, you came back here to talk to Anthony about his equipment.  Opie decides to take all of it.  He was like, you're either behind me or you're not.  Oh, shit.  He ends up getting in the elevator.  Dude, you're not going to win the argument for food.  He ends up getting in the elevator with Club Soda Kenny, and he takes Travis with him.  Absolutely, yes.  And you see them going, so you answer Anthony's question, you run out of here as quick as you can. 
[00:07:00]  Yes.  Because when it comes to Opie, you are stuck up that guy's ass, correct?  Well, you know.  He ran like a refugee camp.  Yes.  So, you run down the hall to catch up to Opie.  What happens from there?  Well, I get in the elevator.  So, we're all in the elevator.  All four of us.  All four of us.  The four horsemen of the Opie and Anthony show.  You know, happy-go family.  Happy-go family?  Yeah.  Happy-go.  Happy-go.  Those that say?  I'm not going to finish the phrase for you, because I don't want you to know it. 
[00:07:30]  Okay.  But the phrase, happy-go family, does not mean anything.  Go on.  We're in the elevator, and we start to, we're about to descend.  And all of a sudden, Opie reaches over, and he's in his pocket.  He says, ah, fuck, I forgot my ID.  Oh.  So, I'm like, ah, man, they're going to let you in.  So, then, uh.  He's Opie, after all.  Yeah, they didn't let Bruce send, but yeah, go ahead.  Yeah.  Club Soda Kenny have Facebook.  He has a brilliant idea.  Looks at me, and he says, Mars, do you have your ID card? 
[00:08:00]  And me being so honest, and not so sharp, I go, yeah.  I would say both of those things are true.  I said, yeah.  And he goes, well, lend it to Opie.  So, then, you know, happily, I lend it to Opie, because I'm doing him a favor.  But, as I hand it over, and he takes it, I realize, I'm not going to be able to get back in the building.  Because, mathematically, there is still one less ID card than a person. 
[00:08:30]  Exactly.  Right.  So, then, I go, I can't get it back in the building.  And Kenny turns around and says, well, then, you stay here.  So, but you can try it twice.  One goes in there, and then you come back around and go to the other.  Well, that's hindsight.  Exactly.  2020, you know what I'm saying?  I didn't think about that then.  Me no thing.  So, the elevator lands on the first floor, and I see these three gringos just walk out and look at me.  Oh, it's a white, white thing.  Hey!  Morgan Stanley, guys.  Didn't you see it there?  That was straight up racism, man. 
[00:09:00]  Why a Latino had to stay in the elevator and go back upstairs and give out his ID card?  I think it was where they just didn't want to hang out with you as a person.  Just you.  Yeah, because Opie had ID in the pocket.  He was here.  No, no, no.  You did.  Actually, I came up here, motherfucker.  He ran back down the hallway.  I wanted to see how bad of a dick fucking Opie is.  I run over to his area.  Isolate, isolate, isolate, isolate.  I wanted to see how bad he was, and I run over, and I see that he did indeed forget his ID card.  So, Mars, how long have you been working for this show? 
[00:09:30]  As long as it's been part of XM.  Six years, just about, right?  It's going on seven, right?  I guess so, Eric.  Almost seven.  Yeah, almost seven years in October.  When are you going to give it up?  Give what up?  He's not going to be your friend.  Let me tell you something.  Like, you just, and this is Mars' MO, just so everybody knows.  Mars is our engineer.  And he, for so long, this is dating back to Opie's wedding.  When he's, Opie, I guess my invitation must have got lost in the mail or something a week before the wedding. 
[00:10:00]  So, he has to give you an invitation because he's guilted.  I mean, Mars, he follows him around like a puppy dog.  He's, every angle he can possibly work.  Yesterday, if you remember, yesterday was such an action-packed show.  It kind of got swept under the radar.  But, if you remember, Opie, at the beginning of the show we mentioned, he left his hat here.  And that's why I put the Mars alert out.  And literally, and it would have to be funny, but it was you being you.  He ran into this room as fast as he can.  He grabbed the hat because he knew Opie had left minutes ago.  Which means he didn't have a lot of time. 
[00:10:30]  And ran as fast as he could out of this building to find Opie.  Yeah, I got in trouble for that.  What do you mean you got in trouble for that?  By who?  I scared somebody.  Who?  That wasn't supposed to be scared again.  Oh, you're talking about Opie from his YouTube video?  So, Opie got mad at you for scaring him?  No, not Opie.  Who?  Kenny?  Club City Kenny got mad at him?  That's why he's playing his Facebook.  Oh!  Oh, because you're not, because then it's like you're, oh, you're pointing out security.  Oh, Jesus, Mars. 
[00:11:00]  What?  And you're bringing it up on the air?  I brought what up?  So you got in trouble.  I'm in a little bit of hot water.  Well, it is what it is, I guess.  It's like I said, safe place here, right?  Yeah.  It's a safe place.  We talk to each other.  Yeah, when are you going to give it up and realize that, like, he looks at you like a  co-worker, and once he's done here, Opie's finished with you.  It's like Troy.  Like, you look so good today, man.  Yeah, get out.  Man, did you work out today?  Because you look really, really, really good.  Is this your strategy when you insult Troy to see how quick it takes him to run down the 
[00:11:30]  hall?  No.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  And Troy, like, he looks so good.  I can't talk this way because my shirt's so tight.  Jesus.  Is he coming down?  No.  Well, you know.  When are you going to just be down with this?  You guys are all cock blockers.  Because you know, if I have that time with Opie, man and man, hanging out.  Yeah.  He's going to realize.  Mano y mano.  But you need Sam to translate for you.  Mano y mano is hand to hand.  Man to man.  Man to man.  Right.  Hanging out.  He will see the value of the friendship that would come from me. 
[00:12:00]  So you think that the other guys on this staff are so worried about the close, tight, personal  bond that you would build with Opie, that that jealousy is enough to stop it from happening.  Ditto.  And who is doing it?  And by the way, ditto means...  I agree.  I agree with you.  No, it doesn't mean I agree.  It means I'm saying the same thing. 
[00:12:30]  Ditto.  Ditto.  Whatever.  Idiot.  It's not the correct use of the word ditto.  All right.  Whatever.  Who?  Who's the...  No names.  No names.  I'm just saying that throughout the year...  Am I blocking it?  He wrote down Gary.  I don't think Gary...  Gary hasn't been around for seven years.  I'm just being with you real.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  And by the way, speaking of Gary, just remind me, there were guys from management who came  in while we were tricking Joe DeRosa, who thought the show was off the air.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, it was funny. 
[00:13:00]  So, Mars.  Am I one of the people...  You can...  I mean, you know, there's been times you cockblocked too, but am I cockblocking you because I know  what your intentions are and I think it's funny to sabotage or because I'm jealous?  That's what it is.  It's just funny sabotaging all guys are doing so.  But there are people...  No, and I don't think anybody's doing it viciously maliciously, it's just funny.  You just think everybody's aware that you want to build a relationship, so we're all  doing whatever we can to stop it.  I mean, come on.  It's a fucking common knowledge.  One day I was talking to Opie, right, one morning, and I'm like, you know, the guys 
[00:13:30]  are making fun of me because I don't have your telephone number.  So I...  Oh, and it was just like...  I expected, right?  Because it's so pathetic.  Yeah.  Because that's such like, oh, Mars, here, let me give you my phone number.  Exactly what I expected.  And you know what I got?  That's good.  And walks off.  He walks off.  He's not giving you his number.  He's not giving you his number.  Plus, after what you said about Latinos and little kids, you think he's going to let  you around his son? 
[00:14:00]  He almost...  He went...  Opie went on the air today and told us that yesterday or a few days ago, he went to a  park and threatened to beat up a little kid because he kicked dirt in his kid's face.  Rightfully so.  Okay?  He went and said, I don't care.  This is a quote from Opie, and by the way, 3 p.m. Eastern is when the replay starts, so  you got to hear this today because he went to a little kid, Opie did, and he goes,  I don't care how fucking small you are, I'll beat the shit out of you.  And all the mothers loved it.  So you'll get the whole story from him when the replay's on, but it was a funny time. 
[00:14:30]  Do you think that you've made progress with the relationship building?  And more, actually, more important question.  What is...  Are you...  What about Ant?  Oh, Ant.  Because you're...  I mean, not to say you're not cool with Ant.  Very cool with Ant.  But there's a different vibe I get.  Ant is more open about his stuff, like, you know, like, come over to the house whenever  you want, his open invitation.  Right.  I didn't see you at the party.  Right.  That wasn't an open invitation. 
[00:15:00]  That was sort of...  Did you get an invitation to Ant's party?  A straight up, like, one-on-one invite?  He sent emails to him.  Yeah.  That was Evite?  Yeah.  Oh, Mars.  There was.  There was.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I'm really hurt.  This is not funny anymore, man.  That's news to you, huh?  I'm actually, uh, being, uh...  Damn.  For real?  Um, so what is it...  What...  What's the difference between...  Anthony?  Because, Anthony, it seems like you're good at the level you're at with him. 
[00:15:30]  Like, you guys are boys, you're friendly in the workplace, whatever.  With Opie, it's more like you're really pushing hard to get a legitimate friendship.  I'll show you on the E-by.  Oh, real nice, Roland.  I'm lost for words here, because I'm seeing the actual fucking...  What...  Did you pay for it to do it before?  No, I did not get that.  What is...  You told him the date, you got it?  Yeah.  Eight in the morning.  What is the difference in the way you're pursuing people?  Why are you not pursuing Anthony that way, or what's the difference? 
[00:16:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Anthony can shoot me.  So you're saying Anthony may shoot you, and so you're not going to...  He could see me as a stalker, and just, you know, work out a case against me, and probably  let out a round.  So you're happy just being sort of co-workers who are friends, you and Ant.  You're cool when you're at work, and that's kind of it.  Ant scares me.  Ant scares you a little bit.  A little bit.  Just a little bit.  Because he loves the guns.  He doesn't like the minority.  The minority.  Okay, I was going to ask you. 
[00:16:30]  You think you have a better shot with Opie, because Ant will always see the sort of brown  skin that you have?  Well, I don't know what he sees.  I just got to be really careful.  You just got to make sure whatever he sees, he likes it?  Exactly.  Okay, so with Opie, it's more like you're trying to make a friend.  With Anthony, you're walking on eggshells being a co-worker, so you're just happy for  what you got.  You notice when Opie was leaving, and Anthony asked me for that technical advice, I stopped  in my tracks, and I was confused, because I needed to go with Opie, but I got to take care 
[00:17:00]  of Anthony as well.  Your job responsibility was, stay here and answer Ant's question, but how often does  Opie ask you to hang out with him?  So you're like, let me answer this real quick so I can run and catch Opie.  He never did.  And it's not even like hang out with him, it's you walking downstairs to Starbucks and  coming back up.  That's all.  That's all I wanted.  You're just desperate for it.  I would have bought the motherfucker coffee myself.  Well, I got his hundreds.  Well, actually, no, because you got the, uh, Mars is not going to have anything. 
[00:17:30]  What do you have to do for tomorrow?  Today.  Are you going to get the barbecue, though?  There's a barbecue, man.  You got food.  Don't do that.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe tomorrow.  Maybe tomorrow.  I won't be here tomorrow.  Give me the hundred will throw for tomorrow.  Forget it.  Monday is when it is.  Monday.  Monday will do it then.  Monday.  Yeah, today is a big day here at SiriusXM.  And I got an email reminder yesterday afternoon.  Mars, did you get this, Evite?  Yes, I get the company emails.  Yeah, apparently the, uh, the summertime barbecue lunch.  What are they making?  Is today, they're doing it in the lobby.  Can you barbecue in the lobby? 
[00:18:00]  I want to find out which place before I commit to their food.  They're getting barbecue.  Right.  They're not setting up grills out there in the lobby.  No, no, no.  If it's Dallas barbecue, I'll throw that shit on the floor and slap somebody who ordered it.  You're not a fan.  Hell no.  I've been to Rub with you multiple times.  Oh, hell yeah.  That's a good place.  And let me tell you something.  When Roland goes to Rub to get barbecue, he goes to Rub to get barbecue.  He eats them out of house at home.  Have you guys eaten their, uh, you know, the food that they cater and all that stuff here  in SiriusXM? 
[00:18:30]  I got the chips before, yes.  Oh, really?  Where do they cater for here?  For Christmas.  They had a nice little...  Oh, I wasn't here for Christmas.  It was delicious, man.  Some of the best sushi I've had.  It's pretty good.  Pretty good stuff.  The best sushi you've ever had was...  Some of them.  I mean, come on.  It was good.  Come on.  You're saying it was good.  Yeah, it was good.  Um, so yeah, I mean, do we have to...  Are we supposed to bring dates to the barbecue?  Because I don't have a date.  I'm going to go and ask, where is this from?  Before you eat any of it.  And I'll just...  If it's some place shitty, I'm just going to walk out.  You're not having it. 
[00:19:00]  Fuck no, I'm going to waste a meal.  I thought you said a meal, but you were saying meal.  That's what I'm saying.  Right.  I heard meal.  I heard it too, but then I said, no, it's Roland talk.  You got to have the trans...  One of us Roland translators can always help you.  Gotcha.  With stuff like that.  I wanted to...  See, there's a couple things I want to talk about.  Because I know Mars is still obsessing.  Yesterday, we had a huge after Opie and Anthony live.  Because Travis and Danny came out of the closet, I guess. 
[00:19:30]  I think that was sort of the vibe I picked up on.  Mars has a bunch of stuff on that, but I think I'm going to wait on it, Mars.  Okay, no problem.  Because I really wanted to talk about this yesterday and didn't get a chance to...  Wait, wait.  E-Rock?  Yeah.  There you go.  You were waiting for it, weren't you?  I think I was.  Because you heard me tease it yesterday.  Yes.  And you were going, what is it?  What does he have?  E-Rock!  My man!  Hello.  How you doing in there?  All right.  Mars, I'll tell you because...  Oh, wow.  Okay.  I have a date to the barbecue. 
[00:20:00]  I have a date to the SiriusXM barbecue.  Who?  Justin Stengel of the Stengel Brothers.  He will be my date.  Wow.  That's right, Eric.  I'm bringing a date.  I'm impressed.  Let's see who you can muster up.  You can because he eats so much, he's the plus one.  Well, let me tell you something.  I was looking over Justin Stengel's TwitPix while he was on vacation.  The guy has some nice legs.  And that's what I'll say about that.  And so as far as him being my date, it's A-OK.  Now, my man Eric. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Sex bagel in the house, am I right?  Sex man.  I got some voicemails from Sandy Kane I need to record and share with you all.  Okay.  She's been calling my office phone.  They're hilarious.  Is she upset about something?  No, she's just really trying to get booked on the show.  Mars, it was two days ago at this point.  Okay.  Rob Cross, who's actually hosted this show before.  Right.  Not very well.  But hosted the show.  He's our boss, right?  Yes.  Right, Roland?  He sucked that day.  Why, that day?  That day? 
[00:21:00]  But Roland.  Was he better than you, Roland?  No.  Let's be honest, Roland.  Yeah.  You didn't do so hot yourself.  No, I ate the big donkey balls.  But regardless of all that, uh, Rob Cross is our boss, correct?  Roland, admit it.  Yes, he is.  Yes, he is.  Eric, Rob Cross is your boss.  What?  He, all right, whatever.  I don't know why you guys don't respect the man, but I respect him.  Rob Cross is our boss.  Sure.  So he has, uh, uh, friends, I think they're friends, I didn't really know what their relationship 
[00:21:30]  was, uh, coming up here two days ago, for the, in the afternoon.  It was like three o'clock, two, no, it was earlier than that.  Um, there are fans of the channel, that's what Julie told me.  It was like two, two thirty.  Yeah.  Early in the afternoon, uh, and these people who were with Rob Cross and, uh, Julia, who  also works here, uh, were fans of the virus.  Fans of O&A, Ron and Fez, after O&A, I'm sure.  And so he's giving them a tour of Sirius.  But they got to see E-Rock at work. 
[00:22:00]  Well, so he's going around, office to office, shows them liquid metal.  That's where, you know, Jose is in there, dude.  Jose says, yeah, what's up, bro?  Yeah.  Goes into Hits One.  Mikey Pipps in there typing away.  Roland, what was he wearing?  Something looser?  Tighter than a motherfucker.  Yes.  I mean.  With his Ray-Ban glasses.  I mean, he, like, his nipples, like, out of his shirt.  So he's going channel to channel down, showing everybody's office, and they go, and this  is the one that you've been waiting for, okay?  This. 
[00:22:30]  Just open the door.  This is the virus office.  Your favorite channel on the platform.  This is E-Rock's office.  The guy.  The guy.  I mean, E-Rock is so famous, he has a character named The Virus.  Like, if anybody represents virus, it's E-Rock.  I was thinking of poo-poo, so I don't know.  You were out of the office, it was just E-Rock in there, plugging away, doing whatever he  does.  The door was shut.  So Rob goes, you guys want to see the office?  First, they take a look at all the pictures that E-Rock has hung up, all the Opie and Anthony  memories. 
[00:23:00]  Then, Rob opens the door for the tour, and Rob and the rest of the tour walk in to find  Sex Bagel asleep on the couch.  Wasn't asleep.  He was napping.  I was not asleep.  Eric was in his office napping at 2.30 while his tour was going on.  Correction, trying to wasn't a police.  Eric, you have to be humiliated at this point.  No, because as soon as he opened the door, I yelled at him.  I go, just walk into my office.  It's not your office, it's the company's office. 
[00:23:30]  And it's like, now he's playing tour guide.  What do you mean just give a tour?  What do you mean just play in the office?  You've given tours, Eric.  Oh, I didn't think you were in here.  So I'm like, that's okay?  If we weren't here, just open the office and give a tour to people.  Eric, you're not supposed to be sleeping in there.  Sam, I arrive at that point.  It's not at 3 o'clock, I'll do what I want.  It wasn't after 3.  It was too.  No, it wasn't.  Yes, it was.  No, it was 2.30.  No, it was close to 3.  Ron and Fez were over.  Was it after 3 or close to 3?  I think Ron and Fez just wrapped up.  So it was before 3.  No, they're on 3. 
[00:24:00]  Didn't they wrap up at 3?  They wrap up before.  If they just wrapped up.  They were over.  I know they were over.  I can tell Ron was walking.  You're bullshitting because Ron was not out there.  No, he was walking around.  So, either way, if you're done at work, you leave work to go to sleep.  Eric said, get out!  This is Eric.  Yeah, I'm sleeping!  Why were you sleeping in the office again, Eric?  Again?  Yes, again.  You've been yelled at.  You've been, not yelled at, I should say, made fun of on the air for napping in your office.  I do not sleep in that office very often at all. 
[00:24:30]  You know how often I sleep in my office?  Never.  Do you know how often my office mate sleeps in that office?  I'm not talking to your office mate.  No, but I'm saying, I'm not the one that sleeps in that office.  Yes, you are!  Yes, you do, Eric.  Eric.  Okay.  Your office mate is very offended.  Listen, your office mate...  Oh, I want to talk to you, too.  Don't go anywhere.  Hold on, phone.  It's Eric.  You're on the air.  What's up?  Hey, did you get my email?  No.  About? 
[00:25:00]  Those sleepers.  Yeah, they're right.  All right, we'll let that take care of that.  But the thing is, Eric has...  Zito's in here.  Okay, you can yell at him in a minute, I guess.  But Eric, you've been...  You never see that often.  Roland is your office mate.  Yeah.  And Roland, I mean, I literally walk in on him sleeping in that office probably three times a week.  Almost daily.  He sleeps in meetings.  Like, he falls asleep during meetings.  I get bored.  He fell asleep at Paul McCartney's sound check.  The guy just sleeps wherever he goes. 
[00:25:30]  If he's standing still, he's falling asleep.  Yeah, that's true.  But he doesn't close the door.  No, he doesn't.  He doesn't close the door.  So, Eric, if your defense is I sleep in the office less than Roland does, it's not a defense.  No, that's not my defense, but you're saying I sleep in there all the time, which I don't.  Well, the reason that people have the perception is that first...  They're not doing their own shit, so...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Is that first it...  You're not doing your own shit.  You're sleeping.  At three o'clock, I'm done.  I'm killing time to go somewhere else, so I'm going to hang out in my office. 
[00:26:00]  It's not your office.  It's my office.  It's a place of work.  People don't sleep in their offices all afternoon.  Mind your business.  Eric, the problem is...  I'm just going to walk into other people's offices.  What are you doing?  I'm going to just give a tour.  Eric, the problem here is perception, because you've been mocked on the air for sleeping in your office.  Oh, well.  So, the key is, if you would like them to stop mocking you from sleeping in your office, don't sleep in your office anymore. 
[00:26:30]  No, he's doing it right.  He doesn't do that.  I mean, he does it rarely.  It doesn't matter.  You should never be doing it.  No, he's doing it right.  Oh, shit.  Continue doing it and not give a fuck.  But he does give a fuck, because he doesn't like when they make fun of him.  Well, I got mad.  I'm not complaining about this.  Yeah, he's losing that shit.  No, he doesn't like it when he gets made fun of him.  I'm not complaining about this.  I did learn from Eric, though.  Rob woke me up once, and I said, don't ever do that again.  For real?  And he shut the door.  You understand where this completely fits the E-Rock the Sex Bagel character that's been built as, like, this lazy, sleepy guy on the air. 
[00:27:00]  Right?  Whatever.  Whatever brings in the listeners.  It's not a matter of bringing in the listeners.  You were napping in the office while Rob was giving a tour.  At 3 p.m., yes, I was.  I was trying to.  Yeah.  Not successful, but I was trying to.  But then you get at 4 o'clock, though.  Because we.  And then, yesterday, we leave the, I'm off the air, and Roland goes, come here, Sam, you've got to see this.  And what did you show me, Roland?  I showed you the Comic-Con list of who you're doing. 
[00:27:30]  Incorrect.  Eric, you know what he showed me?  What?  The masterfully shot.  Almost.  Almost.  He's getting scared.  Almost Kubrick-like.  He's a boy, then.  Shut up.  I don't want you about this, sir.  No, no, but I didn't put it on YouTube.  Roland.  I didn't put it on YouTube.  Hang on, hang on, hang on.  No, no.  Roland.  You have the video.  Roland has.  You have the video.  Hang on.  You son of a bitch.  I told you I was going to tell him.  You said that.  I told you I was going to tell him.  Roland has a video of Eric, like Mars. 
[00:28:00]  When I tell you dead ass asleep, like, you know how if you nap in the office, you can get stirred or whatever?  Like, Eric was asleep, like somebody, like, no, no, no, no, like dead.  Eric was asleep, like somebody sleeps in their bed in the middle of the night, three hours into a six hour sleep.  Right.  Like, he was dead to the world.  Roland wakes him up making a noise, and you know how, like, some people, when they wake up after a deep sleep, they jump right up, and that's how you know they were really sleeping?  That's what Eric did. 
[00:28:30]  You know what the funny part about that video is?  It looks like it was shot backwards.  It looks like I was supposed to jump onto the chair and go and lay down.  I blocked Apple TV.  No, no, no, no.  Mars, could you please move that?  Thank you.  God damn it.  We got to go soon, right, Eric?  No, we got time.  Are you sure?  No, we got time.  Uh, because, uh.  Let me come in there for this.  Hang on.  Yeah, Sam.  Eric is coming in.  I was laughing at Eric after the video that I shot.  I love it.  I love it, Eric.  And, and, and.  Yeah.  I love it. 
[00:29:00]  God damn it.  I love it.  Look, Roland, you can't play both sides.  You can't be like, if, if Eric's not there, you can't be like, look at what this idiot  was doing, sleeping.  And then Eric's around and you're like, well, he can sleep at 4.30.  All right.  I can't, for some reason, get this, the Apple TV thing's not showing up, but I'll put this.  It's on.  You know, no, I know, but the symbol's not showing up here and I'm connected through  Wi-Fi.  I don't know what's happening.  Why don't you show it to me then?  I'm going to show it to you and this mic's on, right?  Yeah.  I'm going to leave the audio here.  Okay.  And you're going to have to watch what happened to Roland.  After I'm laughing.  I've never seen this happen ever. 
[00:29:30]  And this was going on in the office.  To a human being.  Okay.  Okay.  But then this is what happened to Roland.  Roland, you deserve this.  Okay.  And I told you, you started laughing because I didn't know you taped that and then you  told me and I said.  Well, you whacked that in my head.  And you go, oh, I can't wait to show this.  And then when I got this video, you're like, I will never show that video in my life because  you didn't want this to serve me.  I didn't know asshole would say something.  Okay, sure, sure, sure, sure.  Of course you did.  I didn't think.  Here we go.  What the fuck happened?  What?  I got fat crap.  Oh, no.  You didn't know you were being filmed, Roland. 
[00:30:00]  No, because I was laughing.  Stop.  Okay.  You didn't know you were being filmed.  Let me explain what happened.  And he goes, Roland goes, Roland goes, ah, I got a fat cram. 
[00:30:30]  Let me explain what happened.  And then I'll show the video.  He goes, I got a fat cram.  And then he turns around and just turns beet red because he realized that was video.  You ever, like, maybe you got up too fast or you stepped wrong and you pull, like, a  muscle in your leg, like a Charlie horse kind of thing.  You're like, ah, damn it.  I've never seen somebody pull a muscle in their stomach to chest area where he was leaning  back in his chair and couldn't sit up because he's grabbing, like, this right side of him  and he's screaming, ow, ow, I have a fat cramp. 
[00:31:00]  He couldn't get up.  His face turned red and he's spitting and just, like, trying to breathe.  He's like, ah, ah, I got a fat cramp.  Ah.  Like, that high-pitched noise he makes.  So, Eric, as far as you napping, I like the approach you take.  You're saying, yeah, I was doing it.  It was three o'clock.  It's my office.  I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want to do on my time.  My work was done.  It was well past the time I was supposed to be there.  We were killing time to go to something else.  What time are you supposed to be there, too?  Till, like, till, like, one o'clock, one, two. 
[00:31:30]  What time?  I mean, look, Eric, we all know what time you get there.  Wait, wait, eight hours is this?  Yeah, nine hours.  They count one hour for lunch and social time.  Well, fuck that.  You don't, you don't, you don't abide by that.  No, eight hours.  You refuse that.  You agree with that.  But who really here about, come on, Eric?  No.  Nine hours.  No, fuck that.  Nobody takes the hour for lunch.  No.  Yeah, but we do spend some social time.  Regardless, doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  So anyway, it was done, had everything, you know, what I was supposed to do.  We're killing time because it didn't make sense for me to leave the city and then try  to get back in to go to Harry Potter. 
[00:32:00]  So I said, screw it, we'll just hang out here.  I was beat.  I go, I'm going to take a nap.  You can take a fucking nap if you want to.  Yeah.  I love it.  And I do the courtesy.  That's why everything's closed off.  That's the courtesy.  That's your courtesy to them.  I will shut the door so you don't have to watch me nap.  If I'm laying there on the couch or if Roland's passed, no, passed out backwards while the  chair's bending, he's going, like he's choking.  All right.  So that's why we have everything locked off.  Plus, it's our office.  All right.  Well, we got to.  We're running into time now, Eric. 
[00:32:30]  Now we got time.  What do you mean we got time?  What time?  It's Ron and Fez's time.  You don't run this shit around here, Eric.  Aren't you going to play a bit?  Well, we ran out of time, unfortunately.  Unfortunately, Mars, I was going to.  It's a good thing you brought that up.  But we completely ran out of time.  Eric, I guess you have to yell at Zito off the air.  Hold on a second.  The what?  You have to yell at Zito off the air then.  One more time.  I guess you'll have to yell at Zito off the air.  Yeah, I'll take care of that. 
[00:33:00]  I'm going to find out what that was all about.  This has been After Open Anthony Live.  Open Anthony and this show will continue tomorrow.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  There we go. </pre>
