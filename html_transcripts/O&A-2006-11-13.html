<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a humorous bit about a fictional rage-inducing virus, the "ONA virus." Anthony recounted a heavily intoxicated experience at a one-year-old's birthday party, followed by a Star Wars marathon.  Opie described his weekend attending comedy shows by Jimmy Norton, Brian Regan, and Dane Cook, including a painfully awkward introduction by their producer, Roland, and a VIP strip club experience with listeners, highlighting the size of listener "Big John" and Anthony's clumsy lap dance attempts.  Norton's recent emotional distress and $300 expenditure on a sex worker were discussed, alongside Opie's encounter with a belligerent mental health patient. Box office numbers for films like "Borat" and lawsuits against its producers were also mentioned, followed by a critical article about Louis C.K. and Patrice O'Neal's jokes at a homeless women's fundraiser.

Patrice O'Neal was a guest in studio for a significant portion of the show.  The hosts and O'Neal reacted to a New York Post article criticizing their Comedy Cares for the Homeless jokes, which included references to harming women and children.  They read excerpts from the article, highlighting its use of out-of-context quotes and the withdrawal of support from donors like Merle Hoffman.  The discussion was filled with highly offensive language targeting the critics. The "homeless shopping spree" segment was also promoted, along with other unrelated topics, including music and football.  A listener called to correct their pronunciation of Merle Hoffman's name.

Jim Norton, also a guest, discussed a recent breakup in graphic detail, with sexually explicit humor and speculation about his ex-girlfriendâ€™s motivations. Patrice O'Neal offered both sympathetic and mocking responses. A comedic bit involving a "retarded-hosted public-access cooking show" featured extremely crude and offensive jokes. Louie CK briefly called in to promote his Vegas shows.  Other topics included ESPN's lack of hockey coverage, a (later discredited) Britney Spears sex tape, the hosts' upcoming appearance in FHM, and the "homeless shopping spree."  Anthony's "walkover" bet on people wearing gloves devolved into vulgar jokes about race and gender.

The show also heavily featured a discussion of Kevin Federline (K-Fed), his unpopularity, failed music career, and perceived parasitic relationship with Britney Spears. The conversation was sexually explicit, delving into sex tapes and Britney Spears' perceived decline.  This transitioned into a discussion of police brutality, sparked by a CNN montage, with callers offering varying perspectives, including a Philadelphia police officer.  The existence of a midget female deputy sheriff led to highly comedic and offensive jokes about her physical characteristics and job performance.  Additional topics included personal freedoms, a listener's report of a Borders employee refusing to sell Jim Norton's CDs, and Lindsay Lohan's insults towards Paris Hilton.

A segment included a discussion about a purported audio clip of Paris Hilton using offensive language.  The hosts and a female guest, Lindsay, analyzed the clip, using highly profane language. A news segment about children accessing pornography via PSPs led to further sexually explicit conversations about pornography and childhood pranks involving excrement. The hosts and guests shared embarrassing childhood memories and detailed accounts of their experiences with prostitutes in various countries, including graphic descriptions of sexual encounters. A promotion for a pornographic website's video contest concluded this section.

Finally, a caller recounted his trip to Brazil with his girlfriend, detailing her transformation from hesitant to assertive participation in the sex tourism scene, including specific encounters and a credit card incident.  Opie discussed banning critical listeners from Paltalk. The show ended with the hosts' typical sign-off.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  It was outside, it was coming through your windows, it was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease, fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours? It infects, replicates and kills this fast? These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct. I wish to God they weren't.  I said one. 
[00:00:30]  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves puft shules. There's nothing you can do about it.  God almighty.  We've got to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right, we're coming out. Here we go.  Opie.  Shut up.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty. Wipe me. 
[00:01:00]  James Norton.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Let's.  What's up, Chicago? 
[00:01:30]  Went to bed early.  Lucky you.  Bears over the Giants last night.  38 to 20.  Kicked the Giants' ass.  A little bit of an oop there.  Might just beat the Pats.  Looking good. Almost blowing it at the end, though.  And then the Bills.  Jesus.  Bill.  The Bills. 
[00:02:00]  Could have taken out the Colts.  Missed field goal.  Oh, God.  Oop.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  What's up, Anthony?  Hanging.  You know, Monday.  I had to recover yesterday.  I wasted a whole day. 
[00:02:30]  I hate that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I went out Saturday to a party.  Kids party.  One-year-old's birthday party.  You're getting hammered at kids parties.  God.  God smashed.  That's bad.  You laid?  It really is.  Yeah.  You mingle with any of the party goers?  A couple of nice ones.  Yeah.  It just isn't like the old days.  So, you know, you tip a few back and then Sunday comes around and I was immobilized. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Immobilized.  When I'm laying in bed.  How much alcohol do you drink at a one-year-old birthday?  That's what I'm saying.  That seems to be a little weird.  No, you know what it was?  It was all the adults were in one part of the restaurant and the kids party was taking  place in a complete other room.  So, it was like, you know, my family all together just hanging out and drinking.  Yeah.  And then there were little kids, you know, the party.  Occasionally, like, you'd see big guy in the Elmo suit go in and then he'd come out 
[00:03:30]  and then there's other, like, a puppet show guy would go in.  John Wayne Gacy would go in in a clown suit.  Clown with a Chicago accent.  Hey, kids.  What's going on?  Hey.  How you doing there, you little feller?  So, but all the adults, you know, my uncles and stuff, we're all just hanging out and drinking.  Before you know it, you go, oof, you know, I'm feeling a pretty good buzz. 
[00:04:00]  And then, but like in the old days, forget about it.  Could have all night long just kept drinking.  All night long.  All night long.  And then Sunday, I woke up with a chisel going through my ear.  Just a chisel.  Sort of felt like.  So, I had to lay there and watch the Cinemax Star Wars marathon that was on for 18 billion  hours of just Star Wars.  That's all you did yesterday?  Dude, I watched from the first one to the last one. 
[00:04:30]  Wow.  All in a row.  So, just kept watching it and kind of got an appreciation for a few things that I kind  of bashed in the past and other things that were kind of silly.  Like what?  Some furry thing that Lucas had made so he could start?  Exactly.  Now, Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie out of all of them.  And I even mean the new ones with all the whining of Hayden Christensen.  And, you know, Return of the Jedi, horrid puppet show. 
[00:05:00]  It's a puppet show.  It's not a Star Wars movie.  It's a puppet show.  That's all you saw with these little stupid Lucas puppets, Muppets.  What noise did the Ewoks make?  Was that their noise?  Oh, they would just, and it was, I sat through it just going, I have to watch it because I'm  watching them all.  Yeah.  And it was awful.  The newer ones kind of got more of an appreciation for those, even though I can't stand the whiny 
[00:05:30]  Hayden Christensen with his, just, just, it's not fair.  Why can't I be a Jedi master?  Shut up.  Stop your whining.  But the battle scenes and lightsaber battles, you cannot compare the early Star Wars, you  know, the original Obi-Wan and Darth Vader lightsaber battle is so lame compared to, you 
[00:06:00]  know, the Qui-Gon and Sith and young Obi-Wan lightsaber battle is amazing.  You got to explain to people, you watched it on high def too, right?  Yeah.  High def on Cinemax.  So, you know, that was, it was my Sunday recoup day.  Well, that's the problem with the high def.  When you see some of these older movies, you see all the patching and the mistakes and,  you know, how they, they did a good job, uh, technically of fixing the early ones.  I mean, you know, Lucas did a good job of, and I don't mean adding in the, the crap stuff  that a lot of people say, well, you just leave it alone and stuff, but just to make it look 
[00:06:30]  better, take the hiss out.  If you looked at a lot of the, uh, Imperial cruisers in the space scenes, you'd see this  discolored gray box around them as they were kind of flying, uh, through space because of  the way they had to do the, the, um, matting back then and stuff.  So, uh, now they fixed all that.  So it's a lot clearer.  Uh, the models still hold up.  I think they look great.  Yeah.  As opposed to, uh, the, the CGI that they used in, uh, everything now. 
[00:07:00]  But, um, yeah, there's, there's things that are good with the old ones and things that  are good with the newer ones.  I never saw the newer ones.  I never saw any of the newer ones.  Did you?  No.  You'll, you'll throw up over Jar Jar Binks.  That was another thing.  Like right when that first one, uh, of the new ones came on, I was just like, oh yeah,  this one, this thing.  Oh, this one, this kid's movie.  How do you talk?  I saw me, sir.  Me, sir.  I want, uh, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, oh, Lucas is a putt. 
[00:07:30]  What a douche.  He's a putt.  What a great franchise that could have really gone, uh, well, like this, the second one out  of the new ones, uh, Clone Wars.  Sure.  Best one out of the new ones.  I think a lot of great battle scenes, pretty dark.  You still had the whiny frigging, uh, Anakin, but at least he started, you know, at that  point he started turning a little dark and evil and stuff like that.  So that was pretty good.  Uh, and again, the space battles put to shame anything you watch the original where the 
[00:08:00]  X wings are coming into the death star and you know, it's pretty much them throwing  M eighties on a model and with some sparklers involved.  And then you watch the new scenes where there's, you know, hundreds of ships in one shot firing  at each other and just flying, uh, uh, really close and big Imperial battle cruises and the  smaller fighter, um, uh, ships.  It just looked really good.  A lot of color.  And then you look at the early ones and go, Oh, well, that's all you did all day though. 
[00:08:30]  That was it.  All six movies.  That was that my entire Sunday.  Star Wars.  That was it.  I had a, I had a comedy weekend.  Comedy.  I saw three of the hottest comedians, uh, uh, today.  Ooh.  Started with old Jimmy Norton on Friday night at the Hammerstein ballroom.  Jimmy at the Hammerstein.  Thank you to all of those who attended.  Jimmy killed at the Hammerstein ballroom on Friday.  It's a weird room because it's so big.  It's a cavernous room. 
[00:09:00]  It's like a very weird room for comedy.  It's a tough room for comedy because there's an echo that goes on that could be a pain in the ass, but you played right through it and everyone loved you, Jimmy.  And Jimmy was panicking backstage.  He's like, Oh, I don't know if I have enough new material.  And I sat there.  I've seen Jimmy probably a hundred times at this point and it was all new to me for the most part.  Yeah.  I try to do a lot of new stuff.  You know what I mean?  There's going to be some stuff people have heard, but you just don't want to bore people by doing the same stuff.  So I've been obsessed.  It was preparing for Letterman and preparing for the Hammerstein and getting, which is two obviously different pieces of, you know, material. 
[00:09:30]  Just getting stuff ready because you don't want people to throw up seeing the same crap as well.  I don't know how you do that.  I don't know how you come up with like new stuff like that where you could sit down and go, I'm going to write some new stuff.  If I ever sat down and tried to write something.  Yeah, but we come up with new stuff every day on our show.  Yeah, but that's on the fly.  What do you mean how you don't know?  How to do it?  Because I don't know that whole thing.  If I had to sit, if I had to leave the show, go home and write something.  Here's what I'm doing on the show tomorrow.  Let me write it out. 
[00:10:00]  Well, people don't understand that.  Word for word.  People don't understand we make this up as we go every day.  We have nothing planned as we sit here at 610 in the morning.  I think there are certain days they understand that completely.  Well, yeah.  But that's the beauty of us.  Yeah.  And here's what you do.  Just destroy everything in your personal life.  Oh, is that it?  And talk about it.  Yeah.  Substitute anything that might pass for love with prostitution and the internet and isolation.  And just a multitude of material will come pouring out.  Yeah.  It's either a Bud Dwyer moment or you're going to have a great 20. 
[00:10:30]  And yeah, it was a good time, though.  I mean, Gino Biscotti, I worked with.  He killed.  I'm sorry.  Gino was great.  Fidel Castro is just on TV.  Why are they showing him?  Well, they're showing him in that track suit that's the Cuban Olympic track suit.  Yeah.  To prove that's the latest photo, so they're not doctoring anything.  We'll talk about that later.  Yeah.  U.S. officials are saying he's not going to make it to 08. 
[00:11:00]  No.  He's a mess.  They're saying he has stomach and possibly pancreatic cancer.  It's just a matter of time now.  Oh, pancreatic is the biggie.  That's it.  But anyway, so Jimmy.  Our own fan did a nice job.  They had a nice set, actually.  Man.  So the show was good.  Thank you to the people that came.  And afterwards, I never go to strip clubs.  Never.  We hate them.  And we went up because a bunch of them, they had a VIP party for us at a strip club.  And some of the listeners went at our headquarters at a strip club.  And I've got to thank Big John.  What a wacko that guy is.  You can't not like him, though. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, my God.  Big John's about, what, 6'8"?  He's about 6'8".  He looks like a giant Albanian.  Someone said he was Albanian.  He's just a massive force of an individual.  And if you want to know how big his hands are, try to find two, like, catcher's mitts at home.  And just wear them for the day and try to shake people's hands.  And that's ridiculous, those hands.  One of the biggest dudes I've ever seen in my life as far as, like, just bulk.  He's not fat.  He's just, like, he's just big boned.  And he manhandles everyone.  But he's like a big kid. 
[00:12:00]  He's like Lenny from Mice and Men.  Yeah.  He just picks you up.  He put me on his shoulders because he wanted to take a publicity photo.  I'm like, nah, I don't know.  He goes, come on.  I'm like, all right.  What are you going to do?  I let another man put me on his shoulders.  He was sitting on my lap.  You were on a man's shoulders?  Yeah.  And he had me facing with my legs over his back, which was kind of uncomfortable.  You said let.  You had no choice.  Yeah.  It was almost like you had a choice.  And you're like, let me think this over.  No.  He just manhandled you and carried you around on his back.  He just walks around with his vodka bottle. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  He's just a big alky with a vodka bottle laughing.  And he kept hugging me.  But my face would go by his stomach because he was so big.  But he smelled good.  And I felt really homo-orotic.  That is really kind of gay.  I know.  But he was sweaty.  But he smelled good.  He had a good cologne.  And I didn't get any lap dancers, though.  I was going to.  The dancers were smoking.  Sounds like you did from a big man.  I was trying to be good, man.  I was trying to be good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But Big A was getting one.  It was so.  These girls were really weird. 
[00:13:00]  It was like they didn't dance for you, which was nice.  They didn't come over and throw that crap.  The only girl that came over to me who talked to me about Lucky Louie.  And I wanted just to attack her.  She was so hot.  She's a black British chick.  And I just wanted to lick her feet.  I don't like feet.  But I just wanted to lick hers because she was wonderful.  But, you know, I had a certain person showing up.  So, you know, I couldn't walk in all of a sudden and have my face being used as a color.  No.  So I had to.  No.  No.  I think we got pictures of Big A getting his lap dance.  He.  It was so funny to watch him try to be casual. 
[00:13:30]  Did you see him dancing at one point?  Yeah, yeah.  Tanya was there with Master Poe.  And Big A was.  He must have had a few belts because he was holding like a martini.  Oh, no.  Life of the party look.  Oh, it was great to watch him.  He would just dance a little.  And then realize he shouldn't have confidence.  And he didn't.  Yeah.  And then he would stop it.  And then try to like.  Loses all confidence.  Well, it's just weird how he dances.  You have to like take a tub of water.  Hold that in front of you and try to dance.  It's kind of like how Big A dances.  It's just like. 
[00:14:00]  It's so awkward.  Just try to dance and keep the water in the tub.  That's pretty much how he likes dancing.  But they were great at headquarters.  Yeah, we ate.  The food was good.  Everybody treated us.  The food was unbelievable.  And I honestly, God, don't like strip clubs because I don't like the way the dancers interact with you.  But these dancers were smoking.  Everybody was mellow.  I loved it, man.  And now that my personal life has been suicidal, I will certainly be.  Oh.  Dude, I just, I can't.  I can't do it.  I have to head back now that I can.  And I will certainly be heading back and enjoying that lovely place. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to really.  Yeah.  I'm going to wreck my life there.  From the minute I get off the show until the minute I go to bed, I'm going to be face down on a couch somewhere just begging.  You're in self-destruct mode?  Oh, I certainly am.  Oh, no, man.  I certainly am.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  So thank you to Big John and Al and those guys.  I mean, they honestly did take good care of us and stepping out through us at a really nice party there.  And I very, very appreciate it.  It's definitely a great club.  We're at 38th Street here.  We enjoyed ourselves there.  So I saw Jimmy. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, I brought Roland out on stage.  Oh, God.  Before I came out.  I forgot about that.  I go, Jimmy, do you mind if I do it?  You know, just a couple minutes.  So, and I go out to say hi to the crowd, just kind of warm him up a little bit.  No big deal, right?  And then I drag Roland out there to talk about why he thinks Jimmy's so funny and stuff.  Oh, no.  And he is sweating profusely.  And people got to see the face like...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's got flop sweat and he's just losing his mind.  How many people were there?  2,000?  I think it was 2,000. 
[00:15:30]  About 2,000 people.  He's just there.  And then I just leave him on stage by himself and the crowd's going nuts.  And he doesn't know what to do.  Did he have his dress T-shirt on or a casual T-shirt?  He just had the same T-shirt on for the last three months.  I don't know.  That creep, he always smells like vanilla.  Yeah.  But that was a little treat for everybody because he was really uncomfortable and just stammering.  He was a panicky Pete.  And then he introduced Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, it was the worst intro ever because Ope walked off stage, just left rolling there. 
[00:16:00]  He's like, hey.  Jim Norton.  He goes, Jim Norton?  Jim Norton.  I think he's funny.  Got to give props also to Brian Regan.  Saw him at Avery Fisher Hall on Saturday night.  That was an amazing show.  He was all dressed up.  Do you wear a suit?  Big event.  Oh, my God.  He had his brother warm up for him.  And then Brian came out and they were all dressed up nice because it was a big gig.  Yeah.  It's a really big gig to play Avery Fisher Hall because it's shown for like what? 
[00:16:30]  For sympathy.  I saw Rodney there.  Sympathies.  Symphonies and the like.  You saw Rodney Dangerfield there?  I went and saw him when he was in.  I hope not recently.  Yeah, but two weeks ago.  They wheeled it out.  He did 45.  And then last night, Dane Cook at Madison Square Garden.  It was the New York Comedy Festival.  That's why all the comedy over the weekend.  And he played Madison Square Garden by himself. 
[00:17:00]  Just him, a stool, and a microphone in front of 19,000 people at Madison Square Garden.  Jesus.  Just getting massive laughs throughout his whole set.  And then everyone left.  And he did it again.  All in one night.  One night.  Bring in the next group.  It was unbelievable.  19,000 people.  19,000 people filing in.  And then the people that came early trying to file.  Well, they're filing out, I mean.  And then the people coming early for the second show trying to file in. 
[00:17:30]  It was just a zoo down there at the garden last night for Dane Cook.  And it's funny.  I was at Caroline's last night.  And we thought of this because Cringe Humor, by the way, gave us their awards out.  And I got an award.  Thank you to Cringe Humor for most original act, most original comic.  And they gave Colin Quinn the first Legends of Cringe Humor award, or one of the legends.  And I presented it to him.  It was actually really nice at Caroline's.  And Voss was hilarious as the host.  Patrice went on.  Bill Burr went on.  And Bill won Best Comedy Moment, which was his Philadelphia thing. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Philadelphia.  And Bill was really funny.  He goes, Bill said something about how excited he was to win something from a website.  He kind of just smashed it.  And then Colin went up at the end.  And then Colin had the line of the night.  And he goes, yeah, Bill was complaining that he won something from â€“ yeah, I can't believe I won something from a website.  He goes, you won it for something you did on YouTube, you nobody.  So Colin just smashed everybody.  And thanks to Patrick in your awful suit and CringeHeword.net, man. 
[00:18:30]  It was actually a very nice suit.  Yeah, the Bill Burr YouTube video is legendary at this point.  If you haven't seen it because we're talking to a lot of new people every week, just go to YouTube and throw Bill Burr in the search  and search out what he did to the Philadelphia audience store and own a virus tour there.  All right.  Speaking of the comedy festival, there were shows all over New York for what?  For like a week?  Yeah.  I think it started like last Tuesday.  And nothing but positive reviews for all the shows except for one. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  And there's a reason for it, isn't there?  Well, we're going to go to break, but when we get back, the headline reads, No Laughing Matter.  Andrea Pizer, I'm surprised.  Why?  Isn't she usually pretty hip?  No.  When she writes her stuff in the post?  No?  No?  No.  Not hip like we â€“  Unless it was Andy Pizer.  Yeah.  Anthony Pizer or some other guy's name.  Because in this situation, any woman is going to have to throw in her womanly woman-ness and just unfunny this whole thing up. 
[00:19:30]  Well, we've got to take a break.  Don't go anywhere because there's some great, great reading in this article.  Basically, No Laughing Matter.  She and a bunch of other women had a problem with our own Louis C.K. and Patrice O'Neal.  Let's just say a black and a Mexican wrecked it for everyone.  Exactly.  It is some hilarious reading.  We'll get into that next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:20:00]  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  Off the instant feedback, we've got Mike from Pittsburgh.  He writes, hey, guys, picked up my copy of GTA Vice City Stories.  Anthony, best skit ever. 
[00:20:30]  Wow.  In the GTA series.  Opie, love getting chased down by you and Club Soda Kenny in the game.  Kind of funny hearing you yelling at your character.  Oh, you've played it too?  Yeah.  I haven't played it yet.  Yeah, I finally found my PSP.  Oh, very, very cool.  Home somewhere.  Yeah.  We do a lot of voices in GTA Vice City Stories.  A lot of voices.  They use just about everyone associated with this radio show.  The only person they didn't use was little Jimmy Norton. 
[00:21:00]  But he's got a starring role.  He's a star in the Bully video game.  Yeah, I was away when they did the Grand Theft Auto one.  Yeah.  I would love to do that, though.  Just because it's such a vicious game.  I know.  I didn't even play it, but I love it.  Love it.  So I was walking to the bathroom while you guys were doing the live read for Panasonic  and heard something about you crying for 40 minutes.  Something you want to talk about a little more because you made poor Anthony a little  uncomfortable during the live read there. 
[00:21:30]  You know how The Office is, the original British version.  It's a good show.  It might be my favorite show now ever.  And then if I watch the final two, and it's very sad.  You know, nothing to do with my personal life being in shambles  and the fact that the finality of that represented the finality of other things.  Believe me, those two things are completely not connected.  Yeah.  You know.  Kind of hit you.  Yeah, I haven't been.  Oh, of course it didn't.  I mean, I haven't been fighting the urge to think about something for a couple of days  and just now just avoiding, avoiding, avoiding.  And, you know, spend $300 to avoid last night and don't even get what you want. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, Jesus.  You hear a whole lot of this.  Oh, God.  300 clamps.  Oh, my God.  You know, that's not a way to, you know, just try to get out of your head for a little while.  Oh, my God.  There you are.  That's what $300 got you.  Oh, well, you know, it all depends on the placement. 
[00:22:30]  Let's just say I looked like I was about to start the 500-yard dash.  If you've ever seen a runner ready to start that, on your mark, get set.  I was in the get set.  $300, huh?  Yeah, you know how that is.  When you need love and it's wrecked again, you know, you just do that.  Then you watch The Office.  Oh, Jimmy.  At the end of the next episode, the final episode, when they fire Ricky Gervais, you're 
[00:23:00]  digging a snot rag up your nose and blubbering like a fat kid.  But, Jimmy, this one lasted a month.  More than that.  A little more than that.  Yeah.  But it was...  Look at me trying to make you feel better.  But it lasted a month, Jimmy.  Yeah.  $300 and no steak dinner.  No.  Just a drag.  Yeah, this was a long, long one, man.  This was a...  Whatever.  Yeah.  All right.  But, you know, you replace love with other things.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  That's what Dr. Phil says.  Yeah, Dr. Phil.  Just replace it with something else.  So much for all that working out, huh, Jimmy?  No, that was the...  Please, don't go too far into self-destruct, Mark.  No, no, no, no.  I won't.  Jesus.  I mean, Dr. Phil ought to see somebody, you know, with a tear-stained face, toweling saliva  off, $300 lighter in the wallet.  Oh, my God.  That show's a mess.  Oh, man. 
[00:24:00]  Anthony's getting wasted at a one-year-old's birthday party.  Jimmy's getting...  For $300.  Anthony's doing lines off the kid's stomach.  And I'll add to this.  I gotta say hi to everyone at the psych ward that I met this weekend.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  Anyone I know?  Hello, guys.  Big fans of the show at the psych ward.  Well, that's good to know.  Oh, Jesus.  Busy little weekend, was it? 
[00:24:30]  Jesus.  Anyway.  Getting to that another day.  Wait, there was one more thing.  I'm doing that.  Anthony's doing that.  I forgot.  There was one more thought I had, and I forgot.  Well, so far, it's not looking good for the boys this weekend.  Anthony getting hammered at baby parties.  Yeah.  Not even a kid's party.  A baby's party.  I know.  It was a baby's party.  I really did.  It was 90% physical.  Maybe even 80% physical that I felt crappy yesterday. 
[00:25:00]  And 20% mental, where I was just mad.  I was pissed at myself.  I'm like, what are you doing?  What else do you and your family do?  Do you shoot up at a bris?  I know.  No kidding, man.  A bunch of alkies.  Oh, seriously, when you go to someone's, I don't know, one-year-old's birthday party,  it's a keg or something.  I guarantee you can leave.  It's not about you getting wasted.  It's usually about, all right, I got to do this dump thing, and then later on you get  wasted or something and go out for real. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Because wasn't it during the day, like one in the afternoon or something?  It started at noon.  Yeah, it has to start at noon because it's for a one-year-old.  And I got there early, by about 20 minutes, so it wasn't even noon yet, and the place  was, it was a bar.  It was in a bar, restaurant.  So I just step right up to the bar, absolute bloody please.  Oh, my God.  So I started early, and then the wine started opening up.  And you were driving the GT.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Why not?  I figure if you're a little tipsy, the faster you get home, the better.  Alcohol plus vroom vroom equals uh-oh.  I tell my girlfriend, as I'm laying in bed, and I go, could you just open up the garage  door and make sure I parked okay?  One of those nights.  You got to stop driving drunk.  I think it's awesome. 
[00:26:30]  I really do.  Me too, until you and I are saying, wow, he looks so peaceful.  What are we going to do now?  It was uh...  Whoa.  Please just hire a driver.  Just get a limo.  You're a millionaire.  I love it.  I didn't intend on getting ripped at a one-year-old birthday party.  I really didn't.  I don't even care if you paralyze yourself in the way it's down.  That's fine.  As long as you can talk.  Oh, yeah.  As long as you can talk and be you, you're already sitting. 
[00:27:00]  Not even that.  I don't mind a bag hanging off the chair.  I can live with that.  Not even that.  As long as you can blow through a straw, we'll figure something out.  Yeah.  Look, he's doing Tyson.  Oh, God.  You know, put it in that perspective.  Perhaps you're right.  Yeah, dude.  You've got a great life.  What do you want to do?  Do you want your girl wiping your chin off while your head looks like wax fruit with a bad wig like poor Christopher Reeve had?  You know something?  I'm very good at driving drunk.  Everyone thinks I'm good at driving drunk.  I'm really good.  Holy crap. 
[00:27:30]  You're giving him advice.  We're a mess on this show.  I don't drive drunk.  It's not like...  Believe me.  I may have been getting...  But I wasn't doing 75 miles an hour.  I was on my bed.  I was doing the speed limit.  But, Jimmy, there might be something in that...  Oh, well...  You worry people, too.  Here's what I do.  And this is the truth.  I know it's not right.  But believe me, I'm not trying to make excuses here for this.  You're right.  It is a bad thing to do.  But...  And this is something I've always done.  And this is why I think I've been so lucky as far as not getting a Dewey in my whole life ever. 
[00:28:00]  However, I drive so safe when I'm drinking, even a little bit.  I'm right lane guy, speed limit, and I concentrate, man, to make sure I am not weaving at all.  10 and 2?  10 and 2?  10 and 2 blinkers.  I'm not passing anyone.  I don't care.  It takes me...  I don't care how long it takes me to get home.  When I'm not drinking...  Here's what I did before I got to the party.  I had to pick up a gift certificate from the baby gap. 
[00:28:30]  Who gave you that idea?  I hope he did.  Thank you.  How much was it for?  It worked fine.  Like 200, something like that.  Actually, it didn't work fine because you showed up at the party.  And what did your cousin say?  He goes, do you have my baby gap gift certificate?  They all listen to the show.  I'm like, goddamn, they all listen.  Son of a bitch.  Well, that's a good thing, though.  Yeah, it really is.  So I stop in the baby gap and I pull next to...  There's a white Mustang in a parking spot and an empty spot next to it.  So I pulled next to that and when I come out, there's a black Mustang GT next to mine. 
[00:29:00]  And it's got the shoe polish numbers in the windows, which means it had been to the track  the night before and it had racing tires on and everything.  So a couple of guys had to be early 20s.  I feel like the old guy talking cars with them and stuff.  It was cool and everything.  So ready to leave.  They pulled out.  I pulled out.  Now we're on Glen Cove Road.  That's a straightaway.  It's really straight.  There's a few lights. 
[00:29:30]  It's early and there's a couple of lights.  So we're stopped at the lights.  And he just rolls his window down and goes, you just want to, you know, he goes, you want  to try?  You want to give it a whirl?  Well, you know, it's a goof.  So I go, what the hell?  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's go.  So wait, light turns green, took off.  All I know is I looked down quickly at one point and I was, I guess I was doing about  a hundred and I looked in the rear view mirror. 
[00:30:00]  I swear I thought his car broke.  I thought it had to have broken.  He was so far behind me and he came up to me at the next light and said that he had,  I think he missed a gear or something.  So I go, okay, we'll do it again.  So we did it again.  And same thing.  Same thing.  Just smoked him.  And then I felt like an idiot again.  I'm like, what are you, an idiot?  What are you doing?  Drag racing people?  I love it.  I'm an idiot.  I don't know what is happening to me.  You're turning into a 1950s song. 
[00:30:30]  What's the matter with you?  Dead man's curve.  You are absolutely right.  I am an idiot.  And you know he's not responsible even after he drinks.  He's trying to tell everybody.  No, no, no.  So we're more relaxed.  But you know he's got like White Snake's greatest hits, you know, blasting.  He's got the windows rolled down.  He's mouthing the words to you're my cherry pie.  I'll tell you something, though.  It was extremely exciting.  Of course it was.  It was really kind of cool.  Of course it is.  I understand that.  It's not just goosing it.  Now you're like, there's a little competition going on. 
[00:31:00]  Speaking of extremely exciting, I felt the same feeling when I almost beat up an old guy  in the psych ward yesterday afternoon.  Okay.  Look, this show is falling apart at the seams.  We are a mess.  We're on top of the world and we don't know how to handle it.  Anthony is drinking and driving.  We got Jimmy's paying for it in the middle of the night.  Midlife crisis.  Emotional disaster over here.  And, well, I hope he's always been a psychopath.  I'm in the psych ward yesterday afternoon and I'm on my cell phone, which is a no-no. 
[00:31:30]  And this old bastard decided to tell me it's a no-no after he was, like, just staring at me.  What was a no-no?  Being on a cell phone.  It is?  I snuck a cell phone in.  Oh, boy.  And I'm looking around the room and there's, like, there's an anorexic chick doing a puzzle.  Did you call her fat?  Nah, I should have.  That'd be funny.  She's doing a puzzle.  Hey, what are you working on, fatso?  Some kind of, like, puzzle of a bridge with foliage around the bridge, you know, one of 
[00:32:00]  those dumb puzzles.  And then you got a grandma that wants to kill her babies and she's dressed like she's 20  years old with headbands on and stuff.  Then you got a fat bra that's suicidal.  And then you got a concert pianist, or So She Thought, playing away for everybody.  And then you got a guy watching the TV.  They only give the psych patients only two channels. 
[00:32:30]  So he's going back and forth from channel 37 to channel 38.  I think it's, like, TBS and the Lifetime channel.  That's all they get in there.  And then everyone's lined up for their medication.  And I'm sitting there just, you know, taking in this whole scene, being recognized by the  staff of the psych ward.  That's fun.  And then this old guy just is looking at me while I'm on the cell phone because I'm losing  my mind.  I'm like, this sucks.  So I'm talking to, you know, Lindsay on the cell phone.  And all of a sudden this old man just keeps giving me the death stare. 
[00:33:00]  And I'm like, you're doing the death stare to the wrong person, pal.  And he's looking at me and I'm just sizing him up, sizing up the old codger.  Did you think at one point I might not be leaving this ward on my own accord?  Honestly, I'm getting better because I was getting, I was just infuriated because the  guy is just staring at me and he's getting really just uncomfortable in his own skin because  obviously I'm doing something that's against the rules.  And I guess that might be part of his illness. 
[00:33:30]  And then all of a sudden he's like, all of a sudden he turns and he goes, you're in violation.  Violation.  That's what he called it.  You're in violation.  And I'm like, oh, really?  Anyway, so there's a bit of, I said you're in violation.  And then he gets up to tell on me.  He's going to rat you out.  So I finish on my phone call and then I, I just sat uncomfortably close to him and just  stared at him.  That'll work.  And just had a stare off with an old crazy codger. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, we are just a bunch of douches.  Although I'm a, I finally, I got my age results to a couple of days ago and I got my results  for syphilis, gonorrhea and whatever else I got tested for.  And chlamydia, I'm a clean boy.  You're clean as a whistle.  Yeah.  Good boy.  Yeah.  Well, that's an advertisement, by the way.  Jim wants to advertise the fact that he's a clean boy.  Absolutely.  When did you take the test?  1985. 
[00:34:30]  I went for my results recently.  Yeah.  That's the way to do it.  Hey, really fast.  Yeah.  Borat, the number one movie in the nation.  I can't believe it's not one good year or a good year.  Oh, well, I don't think that movie did very well on its opening weekend, Jim.  That stupid Russell Crowe movie is bombing.  Bombing.  It's bombing horribly.  I couldn't be happier.  Make another joke in the muddy pool, jackass. 
[00:35:00]  Should have thrown a phone at that snooty whore.  A little pratfall.  No, it didn't even make the top five.  Top five, here it is for the weekend.  Saw 3.  Then the Will Ferrell movie only did 14 million, Stranger Than Fiction.  That got great reviews in the comedy, but only in fourth place over the weekend.  Stupid flushed away in third place.  And this movie got the worst reviews, and it killed in its first week.  It doesn't matter with these movies.  Santa Claus 3, the escape clause in second place with, let's call it 17 million. 
[00:35:30]  And then Borat coming in at 29 million.  Second week in a row at number one.  And I guess it's on more screens now finally, right?  Well, the Santa Claus type stuff you're going to bring kids to.  Yep.  So when you're up against a bunch of adult movies, what am I going to bring my stupid 12-year-old to?  It's gold.  Yeah.  I like the Christmas.  The fun part about Christmas movies is when people have this frustration with the holidays, 
[00:36:00]  and all this stuff goes wrong.  It's just like a bunch of hijinks.  Yeah.  Like, oh, the gift for the hassle.  I like when my favorite is when some type of calamity happens with the Christmas lights on the outside of the house,  and it's like a big chain reaction thing that happens.  Oh, I can't get enough of that.  That was funny in Christmas Vacation.  Was it?  Have you seen Christmas Vacation?  I liked.  That movie is still beyond funny. 
[00:36:30]  I liked the movie Vacation before they put any words before it or after it.  Hold on.  You didn't like Christmas Vacation?  Have you seen Christmas Vacation the last 10 years?  No.  You really don't like it?  The last 10 years?  Maybe not.  Dude, watch that movie and tell me if it's not still funny.  Yeah.  That movie is hilarious as far as the Christmas movies go.  But, no.  My favorite chain reaction scene with the â€“ it was in one of these Santa movies for kids where the lights go all kablooey and the grandmother tries to fix them.  And she goes, oh, I'll do it.  And the one light blows up and gives her third-degree burns over her torso and face and head. 
[00:37:00]  And she recovers in the burn unit after some scrubbing, but they don't have wig money.  So, she has to take the toilet seat cover off.  That fabric toilet seat cover.  The fuzzy toilet seat cover.  And she has to wear a navy blue toilet seat cover wig through the holidays.  And no one tells her how stupid it looks.  She thinks it looks like a real hairdo.  Well, dude, do me a favor. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Watch Christmas Vacation in the near future.  And then come in here and tell me it sucks.  All right.  I think that movie is still hilarious.  Let me give it a whirl.  I think that's the only holiday movie I â€“ oh, no.  I also enjoy the one with the â€“ you're going to shoot your eye out.  Oh, yeah.  Christmas story.  It's very cute.  That's still all right.  A Good Year, $3,775,000 for number 10.  No way.  Let me tell you something.  For Russell Crowe, that is a bombing. 
[00:38:00]  And Ridley Scott directed â€“ Ridley.  Ridley Scott.  How did Ridley â€“ Ridley Scott.  Ridley.  Ridley.  And Russell Crowe are in a movie together, and it bombs so horribly.  The tune of three and three-quarter of a million.  No kidding.  No kidding.  Horrid.  All right.  Borat being sued by everyone.  Borat.  Listen to this.  The film has already created waves of protest. 
[00:38:30]  When Borat tried to visit President Bush in a pre-opening guerrilla marketing blitz,  the government of Kazakhstan howled and jeered.  Reportedly, the film has been banned in Russian theaters,  and some of those duped in it have hired lawyers and are trying to make benefit of their own.  They brought us to a bar and got us wasted, and the rest is history.  David Corcoran isn't suing, but two of his South Carolina fraternity brothers are.  They come off as boorish bigots.  They claim they were duped into signing a release and promised the film would never be seen in the U.S. 
[00:39:00]  They said what they've said under false pretenses.  They were coached.  They were instructed to be a certain way.  It's such BS.  If you've seen Borat, they're talking about the fraternity brothers that they met in the RV when Borat was going across America.  You know, there are people, like, sure, their personalities change when they drink,  but there's also people that you know they're a-holes even if you meet them for the first time when they're completely wasted. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  The one guy, especially, you could tell is just a racist ass,  and it doesn't matter if he was drunk or sober, the same crap would come out of his mouth.  And all he needed was a little maybe talking to as they were going on to make it like let him know that it's comfortable for him to talk like that.  Is that what he did?  Or did he just, like, blurt out racist stuff? 
[00:40:00]  No, in the movie, Borat doesn't even really, you know, lead him on.  All of a sudden, like, he's on the RV, and this guy is talking about, you know, racist crap and completely hammered it.  And he just looks like an ass.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And now he's showing a good life.  Hey, too bad.  Don't talk that way if you don't want it.  We have a camera rolling if you don't want people to see it.  Yeah.  Prusey's an ass, too, man.  What college kid wouldn't want to be part of the Borat movie?  I don't know.  Those black friends, whatever, or Jews, whatever.  I didn't see the movie.  You went after the blacks. 
[00:40:30]  Maybe I'll take my-  That's something to say about the blacks.  Oh.  What?  Oh, I didn't hear you, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  No, no.  Was it a good joke?  Damn it.  No, I was thinking about Borat because I was waiting for the theaters to die down.  And I might just realize that maybe I'll take my-  Maybe I'll see it.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Not again.  Maybe E-Rock and I can go.  Yeah.  Oh, boy, Jimmy.  I'll go with you.  Yeah.  Have a good time at the Dane Cook show, did you?  Like the spit in your face right now.  Sitting next to Opie. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, but we didn't talk.  Howling and slapping his knee.  No, we didn't talk, did we?  Not really.  Yeah, we didn't really.  E-Rock wanted to, believe me.  That wasn't his choice.  He actually said, sorry.  What did I say to you, E-Rock?  Do you remember?  Shut up.  He said, oh, what are you doing here?  And I said, sorry.  You know the odds that-  Oh, what are you doing here?  I got great seats through Caroline's.  I was in the fourth row at the Garden last night.  So I want to thank Greg Charles and the gang.  They really hooked me up all weekend. 
[00:41:30]  Like I said, I saw Norton, Brian Regan, and Dane Cook.  It was a great comedy weekend.  And I'm sitting there, and there's two empty seats.  And of course, E-Rock's going to be late.  He's late for everything, including this radio show on a daily basis.  And all of a sudden, he sits next to me, and the first words are, what are you doing here?  Not hi.  How you doing?  How late were you for the Dane show?  You made it.  I got there right as he started.  Yeah.  Then there was this couple, like in the front row, just completely making out.  Not just like kissy-kissy face, like just completely going at it. 
[00:42:00]  Did he point it out?  No, he didn't.  No.  All right, here's...  Probably wanted him to.  All successful films get sued.  Here's Borat.  One more clip here before we take a break.  Another real-life character, driving instructor Michael Pashenska, says he was also misled  and hopes to settle out of court.  Here's the deal.  With success comes lawsuits.  There are really no major hits that don't have legal skirmishes surrounding them.  In her scene, New York artist Linda Stein was clearly not amused. 
[00:42:30]  Give me a smile, baby.  Why angry face?  She's even less amused now.  What he does is he really makes people look like jerks.  This my house.  Answer, please.  Even this real Romanian village, meant to be Borat's hometown, is reportedly considering  a lawsuit over how it was represented.  The film is a ripe target.  It's already made over $100 million worldwide.  Hmm.  I'll never get a second film now. 
[00:43:00]  Hmm.  You think he duped everyone, though?  That's kind of crazy, huh?  Good for him.  That's how you do get these dupes to sign.  Don't sign it.  All right.  Does it matter?  Why don't we take a break?  You did well.  All right, guys.  Let him sew.  We were supposed to do No Laughing Matter.  No Laughing Matter.  Don't we have?  Usually, you know, I've got to be honest with you.  We're brilliant when it comes to the radio tees.  Oh.  We certainly are.  But as far as No Laughing Matter, we're kind of waiting for Patrice to wake up, because  he gets smashed along with Louis C.K. by Andrea Peiser in the New York Post. 
[00:43:30]  Can we get her on the show?  Get Andrea Peiser.  These columnists all hide behind their stupid columns.  And nothing's better than when they write the act, write out a couple of lines or a joke.  Right.  And it's taken out of context.  Right.  And it's written, and it looks like a court document.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, we'll get into it, because it's some fun, fun, fun fodder for this fine radio show.  The headline, No Laughing Matter.  Let's just read the first two sentences here. 
[00:44:00]  The comedy show is supposed to raise money for homeless women.  This is not funny.  And then it just goes on.  Which means hysterical funny.  And Louis C.K. must have the biggest you-know-whats in the business, because the jokes he was telling  at this fundraiser.  Well, Patrice wasn't exactly.  Oh, he's right there, too.  He's the woman's rights, either.  He's right there.  It's great.  We're going to get into that.  Also, I hold in my hand.  You're, um...  Let me look. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, no.  No.  No.  I thought maybe you were...  No.  You're in violation!  Worked up.  I said you're in violation!  You're in violation.  And you're in an institution.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Hey, what's wrong with that kid?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Fifteen-year-old.  Drugs and alcohol.  Seventeen times.  Oh.  Jesus.  Uh, I also hold in my hand, uh...  I'm going to hang out at the psych ward every weekend.  Are you?  Yeah.  Not by choice, but I'll be in the psych ward every weekend. 
[00:45:00]  Check yourself in.  And, uh...  Why not?  You just hang out.  I'm going to have some great stuff to talk about.  You could sleep over.  Eh, you know, do a little sleep over with the anorexic chick doing a puzzle.  Uh, retard hosting public access cooking show.  Stop it.  Danny came running in here with two thumbs up.  Stop it.  Two big thumbs up.  Is it Down syndrome?  Um, does it matter in the end?  Well, yeah.  He takes the hot grease and drinks it accidentally. 
[00:45:30]  Scalges fat-tongued larynx.  All right.  Uh, we'll take a break.  We'll, uh...  He's confused and hurt, but he can't stop golfing.  Does he pull off his hair and use it as a pudding bowl?  We'll continue after the break.  This show is a mess.  $300 for a...  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  I wanted more.  Oh.  It was wonderful, though.  It was good? 
[00:46:00]  Oh.  It, uh, made you forget for a little while?  No.  I kept, let's just say, uh, the flag, uh, the wind wasn't blowing the flag the way it  should, because my mind kept going to other places.  Oh.  Oh.  And I was getting sad.  Oh.  But then I got unsad.  Yeah.  And put a map of Hawaii all over the place.  It's amazing how unsad you get when that's going on.  Her head could have rolled through, and I was like, Carly could have ran in, and I still  wouldn't have stopped.  That's right.  That mouthy bitch.  Good job. 
[00:46:30]  Boy, when that's...  I tell you, when the end of a session is happening, all worries go right out the window.  That's it.  Oh, it was great.  Gone.  Someone's shooting tapioca with a super soaker all over the room, and I couldn't be happier.  Did it look like you were making a pancake on a tilted stove?  Kind of, yeah.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show are appearing in  a special holiday edition of FHM on sale now. 
[00:47:00]  E-Rock's creepy photos from the FHM shooter now online at opieandanthony.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Why, why, why?  Good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  It's so funny, Jimmy.  I didn't hear what he said.  What did he say?  He's talking about his little breakfast that he puts together.  I make a little snack.  Oh, yeah.  What's the snack you're making, Jimmy? 
[00:47:30]  I take some plain fat-free yogurt, and I put fruit in it, and I have a little bit of granola,  not too much for the fat factor.  I'll put usually a little bit of peanut butter on there, too.  Like a little dab of peanut butter, or actually almond butter.  Yeah.  It's healthier.  And I don't know.  Maybe somebody I was kind of loving a little bit, whatever, had my snack, and said it was  very good.  What do you call it?  I'm like, I don't have a name for it.  And she said, all right, well, I'll come up with a name with it.  How about Sad Old Man? 
[00:48:00]  Sad Old Man.  And that was what she called my snack.  Oh, damn, is that funny?  Oh, it's hilarious.  Don't you hate how funny that is now?  I despise everything about it.  I want to eat some Sad Old Man.  Because he's making it.  I noticed he was making it before, and as he's making it, he stared off into space for  a couple of seconds, and kind of like had this faraway little smile.  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  And then I told him, knock it off, or I'm going to smack you.  Yeah, you had to bring him back to reality, and I suggested that this show, especially  today, it's like three heroin addicts in a shooting den, trying to keep each other alive,  and they could barely keep themselves alive.  Yeah, just trying to hold it together.  You know, the websites, the fan sites love having their little surveys and stuff.  They should have a survey.  Who's going to crack first?  Is it going to be me?  Is it going to be Anthony?  Or is it going to be old Jimmy Norton? 
[00:49:00]  Because we all have our own unique problem.  We're going to snap first.  Yeah.  We're on top of the world.  That's interesting.  But this show is holding on by its fingertips.  Yep.  Like the nails of the fingertips.  Right by the nails.  Oh, my God.  I'm just happy when I come in Monday morning, and I see that both of you guys have made it  to work.  And what do you think?  We don't think that, too?  I know.  Don't sit there and go.  I figured someone has to say it.  I'm sure we all, every Monday, we're like, oh, okay. 
[00:49:30]  Cool.  We made it in with, oh, no.  What is that?  I don't know.  Jimmy, but you can't add that to your little treat that you made.  No, I can't.  Ew.  What's wrong with that banana?  It looks like someone ate it and shoved it back in the peel.  It looks like my banana spent the weekend in a bathhouse.  What is dripping from the end of my banana?  It's sick.  There is some kind of brown goo, and it is running down the banana.  Looks like it was used in a Japanese video. 
[00:50:00]  Speaking of which, no one's gotten that sound yet, Anthony.  Kenny, where did you get this banana?  Was it in a medical journal?  This is horrible.  I'm showing this to a high school student.  This is what happens when you drink and don't protect yourself.  This is why you should always have a condom on hand, kids.  Always have something on hand.  Wow, that is hard.  Just throw that away.  I have to.  Why?  Well, he wants to show Kenny first.  Yeah, I want to show Kenny.  Why?  Now he's going to go commit Harry Caray somewhere.  No, because that motivates Kenny to, like, go out and rack head if he doesn't find a proper banana. 
[00:50:30]  I forgot this.  What does it smell like?  Banana.  The banana.  But it's kind of rotting at the top.  It's rotting from the top down.  Oh, Kenny went to get my breakfast.  Okay.  Did he?  So hold it.  Save it until he gets back.  I'll just tell him it was no good.  All right.  No, make him go in the garbage.  Make him forage through the garbage to find it.  To see what he did wrong.  And then he'll commit to Harry Caray in another office.  I figure right now he's in the bathroom with his awful suit jacket hanging over the stall 
[00:51:00]  door listening, wanting to get up and run in but not being able to.  I've got one hanging.  I can't because I have my socks and the socks suspenders.  Hands around his ankles.  He has those stupid socks suspenders.  I think he has those things that like Mr. Wilson used to wear in Dennis the Menace with  the socks to hold him up on his thighs.  His stupid suit slacks around his ankles getting wrinkled.  Actually, I think he just heard what you had to say about his banana and he takes pride  and what he does and he's actually standing on the stall and he's popping the drop ceiling 
[00:51:30]  to see what he could hang from.  Yeah.  Maybe there's a pipe I could tie my tie to.  You know what?  I'll pin it on the head.  That's who Kenny is like.  He's like Richard Gere and an officer and a gentleman.  He has fresh fruit in the ceiling.  So when we need fresh fruit, he'll pop a ceiling tile out and get it just like he did with polished  buckles and shoes.  That's how he gets it so fast.  He keeps it over in the bathroom.  Yeah.  By the way, no one has gotten the sound yet, Anthony.  No.  We've been trying to find the answer to this. 
[00:52:00]  This is this sound.  We know it's something to do with the Japanese.  That's all we know so far.  But no one has gotten the right answer to this.  That's all we know so far. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  Still looking for the right answer to that.  We've got lots of things going on in this show.  All right.  So the New York Comedy Festival was for the last week here in New York City, of course. 
[00:53:00]  A lot of great shows all over the ball field.  And Patrice O'Neill and Louis C.K. are in the â€“ I was going to say they're in a little  bit of trouble, but that is so stupid.  No.  This is what you want as a comedian.  They got some fine press in the New York Post over the weekend.  If this bitch liked this, there'd be trouble.  Believe me.  You're right.  And this is, again, if you just write out small bits that people do during their act taken  out of context, it looks bad to a lot of people. 
[00:53:30]  To me, I find it hysterical.  It's happened to us over the years with articles in magazines and stuff.  That could be a good bit one day to get our stuff.  Maybe the listeners could help us out and find those quotes that we've done in print in  the newspapers and the magazines and send them in.  And then you read it out of context and they sound ridiculous and sound like Anthony really  is a Nazi.  Yeah, exactly.  These sound funny, though.  These sound really funny.  Yeah, they sound funny.  But not to her reading audience. 
[00:54:00]  Like, these women would read this and be like, oh, oh, my God, that's horrible.  These hens wouldn't enjoy it under any circumstances.  Well, they're broads.  Broads don't enjoy lines like that.  Well, this column was written by Andrea Peiser, and she's got an open invite to call our show.  We'd love to get her angle on this.  Come on.  And we'll treat her with respect.  We'll beat her up with intelligence is what we'll do.  The comedy show was supposed to raise money for homeless women.  This is not funny.  That's how it starts.  Right. 
[00:54:30]  This is not funny.  But one comedian starring in the event Wednesday night thought it would be a riot to joke about  maiming, killing and doing a number one on his bitch on his bitch.  Thumbs up on that, Iraq, because we got to get this.  All right.  Yeah.  Stay in close.  Yeah.  Maiming, killing you.  Close contact with Al Duke.  On his bitch.  And only bitches in quotation marks. 
[00:55:00]  Another thought it was a...  What's that, Iraq?  So you're waving your hand around.  What?  It got dumped?  All right.  Why?  We back up.  All right.  Let's start over.  Because this is an article that appeared in the New York Post.  We should be able to read this word for word.  This is funny.  Let's try to get by the dump.  Yes.  That's what we're doing today.  Hold on.  Let's start over.  But one comedian...  No, no.  I would start all over.  I don't know how far back he went.  Oh, the comedy show is supposed to raise money for homeless women.  This is not funny. 
[00:55:30]  All right.  We know that's in there.  Okay, good.  But one comedian starring in the event Wednesday night thought it would be a riot to joke about  maiming, killing, and treating, uh, uh, picture dog, fire hydrant.  No.  Why?  Well, as soon as we say the next line, right?  Okay.  Well, well, it's the, yeah, it's that, that's the problem. 
[00:56:00]  Here it is.  Here it is.  One comedian starring in the event Wednesday night thought it would be a riot to joke about  maiming, killing, and degrading in a certain liquid manner on his bitch.  Had that work?  No way.  Absolutely.  Let's watch.  No way.  Why not?  What?  That went through.  Absolutely.  Wow, Ant, you're good.  That's exactly, of course.  Ant is good.  I say screw the FCC. 
[00:56:30]  Skated.  He, he learns.  Skated.  I say screw it and he learns.  Nice.  All right.  That ought to show them fuckers.  Oh, damn it.  Oops.  One for the XMers, sorry.  Oops.  Sorry, boys and girls.  All right.  I threw one out just for the fun of it.  We, uh, we treated the XMers to occur.  Treat yourselves.  Treat yourself to occur. 
[00:57:00]  I earned that profanity.  Oh, no.  Rumor has it we're going to find, uh, Andrew today.  No way.  They found him.  Someone came up to me on Friday and said they found Andrew, the guy, you know, the homeless  guy, uh, he stomped on his cake, blah, blah, blah.  It's on YouTube.  And, uh, someone found him on Friday and supposedly he's going to be, uh, uh, part of the walkover  today for the first time.  Oh, that'd be nice to see him again.  Because we're trying to get him for the homeless shopping spree.  Yeah.  He'll be so happy to be given money, a trip to a mall.  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  All the listeners will help him out.  All right.  Back to the article.  No.  Yeah.  All right.  We, we got through that line.  Uh, another thought it was a blast to, uh, another thought it would be a blast.  A blast to kid about smashing the skull of his toddler daughter.  Yeah.  Another thought it would be a blast to kid about smashing the skull of his toddler daughter.  Gee, I wonder who that was.  How could, of course it's funny to kid about that.  Yeah.  And at a context, it sounds horrific, but in the context of Louie's act about how miserable 
[00:58:00]  he is having to even communicate with his daughter and you know, he's a man and, and  then you're put in this situation where you got to deal with the, the psycho babble ramblings  of a small child.  There, any parent doesn't get this little thought by their head that they would want  to smash the kid's head in.  And that's where the context that it's in.  Basically, it's the famous OJ line, you know, you, you wouldn't do it, but you understand.  But I understand. 
[00:58:30]  You get these moments.  The raunch fest called Comedy Cares for the Homeless took off at town hall in, uh, midtown  headlined by funny woman, Paula Poundstone and Caroline Ray.  Ah!  Ah!  Both of them.  Paula Poundstone.  Paula Poundstone.  How about that's more offensive having her, uh, host this event?  No kidding.  For a woman.  Why do you think women end up in some homeless shelters?  Perhaps something happened when they were younger and, uh, they weren't able to get their 
[00:59:00]  life back together because some manly looking woman in a suit touched them inappropriately?  Yeah.  Christ, Paula Poundstone.  Yeah, that really, uh, that really wasn't a, abysmal thing she allegedly did or did.  You know, what, Paula, why'd you do that?  Well, best part was no hair to have to spit out.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha!  Yeah, hosted by, uh, funny woman, funny women, Paula Poundstone and Caroline Ray. 
[00:59:30]  Caroline Ray, really fast, the host of The Biggest Loser.  Yeah.  As the contestants continue to lose weight week after week, it's one of the few shows I watch, she's getting fatter.  Is she?  She's hosting Biggest Loser, and the contestants are losing weight like crazy around her, and she's the one that is the host of the show.  That would be a good gimmick for the host to have to be on the show the next season.  Absolutely.  Because she got too fat.  She should be a contestant.  All right, go ahead. 
[01:00:00]  More Andrea Peiser review here from The Post.  But after suffering through the show, one major donor, get this now, get this bull, this hypocrisy.  After suffering through the show, one major donor immediately yanked her support from Care for the Homeless, which is now building a Bronx shelter for women, many of them victims of domestic violence. 
[01:00:30]  So one major donor didn't like the show, and yanks support for the actual program.  Oh, is that great?  Isn't that good?  Yeah.  Because of something two comedians says, one woman, someone's going to get a black eye for her husband.  Right, and have nowhere to go.  How great is that?  Because somebody made a joke that this idiot didn't like.  Yeah, because she put her personal preferences above the cause. 
[01:01:00]  What a pig.  Obviously, she doesn't really believe in the cause if she is going to pull out her support over a dumb joke.  What a pig trying to bully everybody because she gives money to help the people of domestic violence, the victims of domestic violence, not to dictate how the money is earned other places, you pig.  Wouldn't you, aside from it being illegal sources, wouldn't you not really care how you're getting the money as long as the money is getting there to the women that need it? 
[01:01:30]  Mm-hmm.  Especially if it's a comedy festival, Jesus Christ, how innocent is that?  And we've talked about this over the years.  We won't retell the story again, but it just amazes us that these charities will not accept money.  You would think every charity would accept money no matter where it's coming from.  Mm-hmm.  Even if it's coming from Mark Carr's personal checkbook, you would accept it because it's helping somebody.  But no, they got, stupid me, they got morals. 
[01:02:00]  They got morals to the point that they won't accept the money, so people will suffer because they didn't take this money from this questionable source.  Where do you read the next one?  This is a gem.  Yeah, this is great.  It's open season on women.  Wait, did you do the, oh, okay, all right, sorry, go ahead.  Said an angry Merle Hoffman.  How old is Merle?  Oh, he must have been angry.  Merle, president of Choices Women's Clinic, who removed her support.  Oh, Merle is a woman? 
[01:02:30]  What a hot chick.  Wow.  A woman named Merle must be.  Let me get in the mood.  Hold on.  Let me see if this would work at all.  Oh, Merle.  Oh, yeah, Merle.  Yeah, Merle.  Ugh.  That's right.  Let me grab your mullet.  Yeah.  Your Converse sneakers.  You look so hot, Merle.  Merle!  Merle!  And she's the president of a Choices Women's Clinic, but she doesn't like violence against  women jokes. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Well, what do you do when a woman comes in and wants an abortion and it's a little girl?  Wouldn't you kind of consider that violence against a female?  Don't punch them, but it's okay to vacuum them.  That's okay, yeah.  You self-righteous bitch.  Shut your face!  Absolutely.  Thank God almighty.  Shut up.  God bless Louis C.K. and Patrice O'Neill for not adjusting their sets, by the way.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah, talk about taking your young daughter and smashing her head in, but don't mention-  Hey, at least he gave birth to the kid.  Yeah.  At least they had the kid, Merle. 
[01:03:30]  They didn't traipse into the clinic and look for the Hoover.  Don't worry about that little piece banging on the edge of the dumpster behind the place.  Jesus.  That's right.  As you're dumping out stew that could have cured cancer.  Wow.  We'll never know.  We'll never know.  Oh, Merle.  Merle Hoffman.  Uh, who removed her support.  That's what really infuriates me.  Misogyny is the last permissible thing. 
[01:04:00]  Is it?  No.  You dope with a man's name?  Misogyny is the last permissible thing?  How come everybody that feels victimized says that they are the last thing that's allowed  to make fun of?  There's still gay bashing and racism to enjoy.  What's the matter with you?  You dumb broads are third by a long shot.  Merle.  I say blacks, gays, Jews.  And then women. 
[01:04:30]  And then women.  What are they doing at a comedy show?  You're fourth.  You're dope.  That's right.  Merle.  Merle.  What are they doing at a comedy show?  Don't people realize by now that for every laugh that is had at a comedy show, it kind  of hurt somebody out there.  Maybe not someone.  Not Paula Poundstone or Carolyn Ray.  That's what these women wanted.  Maybe not.  They probably howled at those two.  Yeah, but I'm sure they told jokes.  If you really broke down their set, it was hurting somebody.  Maybe not in the audience, but hurting somebody out there. 
[01:05:00]  That's what comedy is all about.  Yeah.  Also in the audience.  Oh, these are more wonderful names coming up.  An unamused Sonia Osorio, president of the city's national.  National Organization for Women, and Liz Abzug.  How is your last name Abzug?  Abzug.  How do you not have a sense of humor with the last name Abzug?  Is that Bella Abzug's daughter or something?  Probably. 
[01:05:30]  Abzug.  That's the sound a guy's fist makes when it hits your stomach.  Abzug.  Abzug.  Abzug.  What sexy, sexy names for, I'm sure, sexy, sexy women.  We've got a couple women screaming at us.  It's not Merle, it's Merly.  It's not Merly.  It's not Merly, you dumb broad.  It's Merle.  It's Merle.  M-E-A-R-L-Y would be Merly.  Okay.  Like it's the Merly show.  Or I have to get up Merly tomorrow.  Merly. 
[01:06:00]  It's not Merle.  It's not Merle, you dumb Stephanie bitch.  Stephanie, you're in violation.  You stupid broad.  You're in violation.  It's Merle, not Merle.  You're in violation, Stephanie.  M-E-R-L-E.  M-E-R-L-E.  That spells Merle.  That's Merle, not Merle.  Stephanie.  Dope.  Stephanie.  We know how to read, Stephanie.  Stephanie, speak.  Hey, Stephanie.  Speak.  I love you guys.  It's Merle. 
[01:06:30]  We love you too, Stephanie.  Why do you think it's Merly?  Well, I didn't.  I don't have this spell.  Oh, it's Merly.  God.  Merly.  God.  Merly.  Shut up.  All right.  You know what?  I wish she didn't get up so Merly and didn't listen to this show.  We got to do the second.  Hold on.  I won't.  We got to do the second half of the column after the break.  No.  But we'll tease you with this.  Now, I like to think I have a seriously twisted sense of humor.  They always say that. 
[01:07:00]  But.  Yeah, but.  Dot, dot, dot after the break.  They always say that.  They all say that.  You know, now, I'm known as the gal that, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo.  I'm no prude.  Oh, I'm not me.  I have a seriously twisted sense of humor.  No, you don't.  When that comedian talks about the peanuts on the plane, I'm right with them.  I understand and I laugh.  When has Andrea Peiser ever displayed anything that resembled a seriously twisted sense of humor?  Never.  I mean, bashing your daughter with a rock. 
[01:07:30]  That's seriously twisted humor.  What do you think that's funny, Andrea, that would classify you as having a seriously twisted sense of humor?  Black jokes.  She couldn't enjoy them.  Well, we'll see what she thought wasn't funny whatsoever.  I'd love to talk to her.  And it has something to do with Patrice O'Neill.  Of course it does.  And we'll do that after.  What?  It just walked in.  Oh, Patrice is here?  All right, we'll continue with this article with Patrice O'Neill next. 
[01:08:00]  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle home.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree.  Only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Opie and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition. 
[01:08:30]  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I downloaded the whole Alice in Chains unplugged MTV thing for my iPod.  Just the whole thing. 
[01:09:00]  Album click, boom, download.  Needed that.  Hadn't heard it in a while.  One of the best live unplugged ever.  That and Nirvana.  Yep.  Unbelievable.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  In studio, Patrice O'Neal.  We're in the middle.  How about a mic?  I did.  Have a mic on?  Say it again.  Hello.  All right, there you are.  There we go.  Good morning.  Good morning, Norton.  Hi, sweetie.  We're in the middle of talking about Andrea Peiser's column in the New York Post Saturday.  entitled No Laughing Matter. 
[01:09:30]  No Laughing Matter.  That's what you want when you're a comic being pretty much reviewed by this woman who has  no credentials in reviewing a comedy act.  Oh, Jesus.  I love the pictures for you.  Oh, my God.  We finally got a look at the pictures.  I told you.  It makes you look like if you was writing a scathing report on something.  They found a picture that I've never even seen myself that looks exactly like it should  look for a bad interview for a bad article.  These are pictures of men.  Yeah.  You and Louie's picture look like men that would just beat their women senseless. 
[01:10:00]  Look at the picture they have of Louie like he's a raven, sweaty lunatic.  Yeah.  What a fuck.  Get his hand.  And you've never looked like this in your life.  I guarantee you this was a joke pose you did for somebody.  For somebody.  Because you got your head back, tilted to the side, all attitude.  This is just when, here's Patrice's picture.  Just when the woman is coming to again after you just knocked her out, she's looking up  and this is the face you're giving her like, bitch, I've hit you harder than that. 
[01:10:30]  And you didn't go down.  And don't let me cut that index finger off so you don't down 911.  Like, that's what her face is.  That's what my face looks like.  Yeah, that's what your face looks like.  All right, let me do that on purpose.  Let me do the real, let me do the quick recap here.  So, Patrice was part of this comedy thing with Louie C.K.  Anyway, the raunch fest called Comedy Cares for the Homeless took off at Town Hall and Midtown,  headlined by funny woman Paula Poundstone and Carolyn Ray.  But after suffering through the show, one major donor immediately yanked her support from Care for the Homeless, 
[01:11:00]  which is now building a Bronx shelter for women, many of them victims of domestic violence.  So, she's like, I'm out.  I'm out.  I'm not helping black guys anymore.  And that woman was Merle Hoffman.  Merle Hoffman.  Merle.  A woman named Merle.  But the other, did you get another?  Hold on, yeah, we're getting there.  It's open season on women, said an angry Merle Hoffman,  president of Choices Women's Clinic, who removed her support.  And a lot of fetuses.  Merle Hoffman as she tweezered a hair up in between her teeth. 
[01:11:30]  Merle.  Merle.  Merle.  Hey, beautiful.  What's your name?  Merle.  Merle.  What's his name?  Bob.  Also in the audience were an unamused Sonia Osorio, president of the city's National Organization  for Women, and Liz Abzug.  Liz Abzug.  Abzug.  I'm so sorry you have Liz Abzug.  I do. 
[01:12:00]  How long do I have to live?  How do you have a B, a Z, and a G in the same five-letter last name?  She should be shot.  It's just how, how do you spell the most unsexy name in the world?  Merle.  Abzug.  Or Merle.  Well, Merle Abzug would be the winner.  Merle Hoffman's a guy you borrow hedge clippers from.  It's not a friggin' woman's name.  Merle.  No.  M-E-R-L-E is Merle.  No, Stephanie.  Well, I thought, I thought maybe she spelled, you know how sometimes girls will spell their 
[01:12:30]  name, it'll be Jill, but they spell it like J-Y-L-L-E-X.  There is no way this is Merle, because it's M-E-R-L-E.  It's Merle.  It's Merle.  How about Merle?  Her name is Merle.  How about Merle?  No.  Merle.  I still say it's not Merle.  It's Merle.  She wears tight dungarees and work boots.  Her name is Merle.  Of course she does.  Walks around with a pocket gazoo and a ukulele with a strap on it around her neck. 
[01:13:00]  She has hair like Joe Dirt.  Merle stinks.  I hate Merle.  I hate Merle, too.  I hope Merle gets abzug on her ovaries.  You have abzugs.  There's abzugs on your ovaries.  We're sorry.  The picture they had, yeah, the Osario girl is the face.  Let me see.  Let me see what she looks like.  She's kind of hotish for somebody who's like, you know.  It's not totally bad for what she does. 
[01:13:30]  No, she's kind of cute.  Whatever.  But she's the president of now right now?  What a wonderful sense of humor she must have.  I bet.  All she deals with is bleeding gums and, you know.  Black eyes.  And bad excuses on why they didn't get their housework done.  I was, I was, I was cleaning and he was drinking.  Yeah, all right, fine.  But why don't you explain why dinner was cold again? 
[01:14:00]  How about that, Toots?  Don't give Sonia one side of the story.  I like putting her picture with, I like putting her picture right next to, uh, Louie's and yours, Patrice.  It really fills out the whole thing.  Wait a minute, that's, no, put, put hers to the, to the left of me, and I'm in the middle, and that's the caption.  Oh, okay.  And.  There it is.  Just like that.  Yeah.  That's how it went.  Oh, wow.  Okay, that's bad.  Wow.  That's not good.  It looks like you two were indicted for raping her.  Right.  That's exactly what it looks like. 
[01:14:30]  Wait, but do you know the original paper, these, it takes up half the top of the paper.  The next article was Nazi riot at a Jewish wedding.  Was, was, Nazi riot at a Jewish wedding was the next.  The next story to read after.  Did it also say no laughing matter?  After your filth.  No, Nazi riot was a laugh reference.  Nazi riot was a bunch of, you know, laugh riots.  And I tell you, I want to see Sonia Osorio's desk.  I'll bet you she just has tissue box after tissue box for, for all the snivelers that walk in. 
[01:15:00]  Got a refrigerator with raw steaks in it for their eyes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You know, it's the organization's logo on the side of the tissue boxes.  Oh, yeah.  Sonia likes the merchandise.  Dude, I don't know.  And they didn't tell us it was a, it was a beating, it was a beatings of homeless women.  How great is that?  You're backstage getting ready for your set.  You've done a million times and you have no clue that there's like people in the audience that have been beat silly. 
[01:15:30]  And I told you, it's the same thing you do.  You know, Norton, you do what you're doing at the time.  That's it.  Norton told you?  Not that you would have changed your act because we know you.  Not that you should.  Hell no.  Of course, of course not.  It was a regular, I thought, we thought it was, we thought it was just a whole regular  homelessness.  Not the beat up one.  Not especially beating women, beat up women, homeless.  You know.  It changed my whole thing.  The article gets much better.  Not only is now National Organization of Women, but it's when you should do the housework when 
[01:16:00]  you're told.  Oh my God.  They had our, they had a problem with our Whip Him Out Wednesday promotion.  Of course they did.  Oh yeah.  We had our run-ins with them.  Yeah.  She's the president of the New York chapter of now.  Of now?  Of now.  How much fun could she be?  It was so, you don't understand man, how, it was so non-climactic, anti-climactic.  Yeah.  To this situation.  I just came in, did my, did my abuse of humor, and left. 
[01:16:30]  Went to a party.  Can I ask you something?  Were you getting good reactions from the crowd?  Of course.  You were killing, right?  Yeah.  Of course.  So you were killing, and stupid Andrea Pizer was in the audience.  She didn't like what you were saying, probably because maybe it hits too close to home, I'm  thinking.  And all of a sudden she has to write a whole column on it.  So you weren't getting booed off the stage or nothing.  There was one lady that could have been Andrea, that were yelling out, excuse me.  She did not.  Somebody.  I don't know who.  Ew.  Excuse me.  And I've heard that excuse before, because of course, I've pissed women off enough to 
[01:17:00]  go, excuse me.  Excuse me.  She was going to say something like, do you have a girlfriend?  Has your mother ever real help?  I was like this.  I was in the middle of doing.  Oh, you heard her and you stopped your set?  I said like this.  I said, let me just finish this one, this one here, and I'll get to your question.  Because she was very deliberate.  She had a very.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  I'm empowered.  And I.  You should not go to a comedy show.  Don't.  It's as simple as that.  Wait a minute.  I go like this, which I know had to piss whoever it was off. 
[01:17:30]  I go, hold on.  I finished the joke.  And then I go, oh, they said I got to go.  Like I did.  They said I have to go.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, good night.  And she said I just woke up.  Not addressing you, you dope.  She should be that zealous when she's dropping those little blue hockey pucks into the septic tank.  That's when she should have that type of, that type of go-get-em attitude.  When there's a streak in the tub, get that, that go-get-em attitude.  Excuse me.  Excuse me. 
[01:18:00]  There's a streak in this tub, and I better get to cleaning.  Oh, didn't I say scrambled?  Oh, I thought you said sunny side.  Excuse me.  It's not your problem.  They picked the comedians for this benefit.  Yeah.  They can do their research.  Do their research, right.  Yeah, go get some boring, safe comics if you're going to be offended so easily.  On my best day, I'm still marginally, like on my least offensive day, somebody can complain about what it's ever. 
[01:18:30]  All right, let's move on with the article because it gets really good.  Yeah, we're going to have to do a little tiptoeing around this one, too.  Now, she starts off this one paragraph.  This is Andrea Pizer.  Now, I like to think I have a seriously twisted sense of humor.  I would love to find out what she thinks is twisted.  You don't.  And funny.  But did you read the part where, oh, you couldn't read it.  Yeah, we're getting there.  No, no, no.  We'll get there.  Oh, yeah.  When they said maim and.  Yeah, yeah.  Maiming, killing, and we couldn't say the other thing on the radio.  That's seriously twisted.  How could she not find that funny?  That's not.  She didn't even say a twisted sense of humor. 
[01:19:00]  She said seriously twisted.  And she likes to think that about herself.  You know what?  You don't.  Like, oh, honey, I can go with the best of them.  I bet it.  Her little coffee clotches she goes to with all her little old maid women sitting there.  She is the life of the party with her jokes.  You know what it is?  They're probably all around with her dumb broad friends.  And they play cards.  And they watch soaps.  And someone says something about having too many drinks.  And she goes, oh, I had too many drinks once.  It was crazy.  Let me tell you.  And that's twisted and seriously crazy.  And twisted and crazy. 
[01:19:30]  You're not twisted.  Your sense of humor stinks.  It's not.  And if Andrea Pizer was the one saying, excuse me, call our show.  Call our show.  We'll let you have the air and see what you're all about.  Free reign of our airwaves to explain yourself.  Now, I like to think I have a seriously twisted sense of humor.  Yeah.  But I was among those who felt ill.  But you're telling us that not many people were complaining, right?  You were getting huge laughs.  Whatever.  Among those who felt ill when I heard comic Patrice O'Neill.  He's a guy. 
[01:20:00]  He's a guy.  They ought to put that.  I heard comic Patrice O'Neill instruct men on how to turn a lover into a pirate.  How great is that?  And we have to stop there because the FCC has a major problem with all these stupid things.  Yeah, but there's a way to do this.  But the fact that she wrote it, that you're reading what she wrote, isn't it?  It's amazing.  That's why the FCC stinks on ice.  It's doing something in the heat of passion that will end up with the woman having to 
[01:20:30]  have one of her eyes shut real quickly.  Like getting something in her eye so it'll shut.  And that is supposed to represent the patch over the eye.  Yeah, you're slimmer in the face with your fist.  And that's supposed to represent the patch being over the eye.  And then it says, then kicking her leg until she says, and it's spelled out in quotations,  this is why when I was reading it, I thought that she was not trying to make a bad article. 
[01:21:00]  Because why would she write it?  Why would you write it?  The joke is, it reads funny.  It reads funny.  She's so stupid for doing that.  Like you don't put arg and then that might have, but she put arg.  But hey, she's showing she's got a twist that says a humor.  Oh, she's so stupid.  No kidding.  Why would she do that?  Because as a dumb woman, she doesn't understand that that's as funny as it is. 
[01:21:30]  So she writes it out and thinks that's terrible.  And Merle agrees.  And so does Abzug.  Liz Abzug.  And so does that other pie eater.  And Sonia Osorio.  Osorio.  And then it says, Sonia Osorio.  That's what you should have said when you didn't give the eggs right to your husband.  I'm Osorio.  Osorio.  Osorio. 
[01:22:00]  Lightheaded.  Osorio.  Yeah.  If you said your last name a few times, maybe you would have saved a few black eyes.  He also drew laughs and gasps.  You drew gasps by teaching men to improve the pinnacle of pleasure, let's say, by paralyzing  partners during the act.  Which was the doggy punch. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, just say that.  I'm telling you, FCC has fine people like crazy over all that.  You can't really describe it.  All those terms are like such a no-no on radio.  And she's making this like, this is my creation.  Right.  I'm like, I'm just going through it.  She made it to be some type of, she validated that nonsense.  Yep.  Yeah.  Absolutely did.  And then she goes way overboard as far as I'm concerned.  Oh, yes.  Then Louis C.K., who's HBO series Lucky Louis, was mercifully canceled. 
[01:23:00]  That's just out of order.  You know, why?  Why?  Why do you have to kick us all the way down?  Because she didn't like it, so she figured.  Of course, yeah.  I thought she had a twisted sense of humor.  What is she like that's twisted?  What is she?  Everything that I think is funny, she hates the office.  She's ignorant, man.  I love this line.  I hate people like this because they think if they didn't like something that everyone  else should not like something.  I hate that more than anything.  Now, this is a seriously twisted sense.  She had a seriously twisted sense of humor, but she'd find this funny. 
[01:23:30]  Then Louis C.K., who's HBO series Lucky Louis, mercifully canceled, one-upped his twisted  colleague, joking about decimating his stupid four-year-old daughter by bashing her in the  head.  And she goes, argh.  I love that.  She should have wrote argh.  I've seen the words argh since Batman.  Hey, hey.  It was on TV.  We have someone that was in the audience, Sheep Lover, who's listening on XM.  The girl who stood up yelling, excuse me, was not Andrea. 
[01:24:00]  I saw the girl who did that.  She was yelling, would you like that done to your mom or sister?  Of course.  Not only.  And then he writes, ha-ha, Patrice killed.  He's the best.  The crowd loved it.  So for the most part, the crowd loved it, except for this bitch.  Too bad you didn't hear that, because you could have answered yes, that you would love  that gun to your girlfriend and mother, and would pay to watch it, depending how much  you'd spend on the ethnicity of the person doing it.  You could have really said, I'll pay extra for an unclipped gentleman.  Oh, wow. 
[01:24:30]  This is interesting.  The next paragraph?  Yeah.  Bobby Watts, executive director of Care for the Homeless, told me he had some complaints  about the show, though in a frantic email to Hoffman, Watts insisted that one of the  show's producers, Carolyn Thompson, was outraged by the material and let the comics have it  backstage.  I'm going to, in a way, I wanted to smash Bobby Watts, but he's the director of Care for  the Homeless, and she yanked money, so he kind of has to do that.  I'm going to say, I feel like I should be loyal to the guy, but they didn't say anything. 
[01:25:00]  Screw them.  He's just trying to get money.  And did someone, yeah, did anybody catch hell backstage?  You even...  Stop.  Could you imagine Patrice O'Neal standing there as somebody lambasting about his act?  You would be, you'd make that face that was in the paper.  That's where they'd get that picture.  It's just, I couldn't believe it was that political, watching this thing, like, reading  and I'm going, what, I just did that stupidness and left.  Oh, poor Bobby Watts.  He then had to. 
[01:25:30]  I want to state that I do not condone the offensive women-hating nature of the routines Watts wrote  to Hoffman.  I wonder if Merle got the email.  Did you write, dear Merle at Yahoo.  Was it dear Ms. Hoffman, or was it, hey Merle?  She got the email in between cooking tips that she was looking up on the Google of a Google.  Merle flips up her flannel collar. 
[01:26:00]  He said Merle.  Merle.  Dear Merle.  Merle's got some emasculated man.  Dear Merle.  Colon.  Some emasculated man that cooks for her.  Dear Merle.  LOL.  You don't even put a comma after Merle.  It's a colon.  Merle.  Another producer, Mark Krantz, disputed that anyone was upset.  He said the organizers knew very well what the comics might say.  We're sorry if it offended, but the performers knew why they were there, and they were there 
[01:26:30]  for free.  He didn't even get paid.  He said the event organizers walked into this with their eyes open.  And I'm sure on some planet, these comics are funny.  Get Andrea Pizer on the phone.  Andrea, don't hide.  Come on our show.  But for a woman's homeless shelter, that's a bad joke.  I'm sure on some planet, these comics are funny.  What an ass.  Just because you didn't like it, that's fine.  You have your own opinion.  I respect that.  But to think that people don't think Patrice O'Neill's funny is ridiculous. 
[01:27:00]  I don't know, man.  And according to Andrea, she has a seriously twisted sense of humor.  Seriously twisted.  I'll bet you her and Merle and the Abzug girl shared a few belly laughs backstage.  Remember that time you got pregnant, and then you sneezed and you weren't pregnant anymore?  Bah!  I bet they chuckle watching that clear hose trying to identify what pieces are going through it.  Look.  Was that a little hand? 
[01:27:30]  I would have shaken that.  Oh, my sense of humor is so twisted, I'm laughing.  Uh-oh.  Mess on the linoleum.  Oh, gee.  Oh, well.  That could have been a president.  That's good.  Great.  Hey, what happened?  From bassinet to biohazard bag.  We got more on the story from Patrice O'Neill. 
[01:28:00]  I guess his fine woman there got into an email battle with Andrea Pizer.  Oh, what a trooper.  Good for her.  She ran in the house.  Good for your girl, man.  Her main thing was, she was upset mostly with Merle.  Merle.  Because it's like, why would you yank your money because of what my boyfriend said.  Yeah, that's worse than what you did.  Like the women don't need the money because you upset her.  I don't think you did anything wrong. 
[01:28:30]  But if you're thinking about what's worse, I think what's worse is like pulling money out  of an organization that needs to help over a dumb joke.  Right.  I'm sorry.  I just got so distracted at what I think was the news.  It is the news.  No, it can't possibly be the news.  No, you're kidding.  It's white people dancing and two of them are wearing the Jamaican hat.  They're wearing Jamaican hats with the fake dreads coming out.  Losing weight to reggae.  And they're dancing behind the anchor desk.  Could you ever see Walter Cronkite with a reggae hat on and dreads? 
[01:29:00]  How the hell could you lose weight to reggae?  Lose weight to reggae, yeah.  You're not losing weight to reggae.  You're smoking pot and sitting in a lounge chair next to a pool.  How the hell do you lose weight and freaking listening to reggae?  Smoking blunts.  Are you kidding?  Stop it.  Look at these idiots.  I can see you losing weight listening to Boy George music, but it's not reggae.  Oh, man, six months later. 
[01:29:30]  There you go.  He's just lost all the weight you mean.  I'm dumbfounded watching that.  Who's watching the news and actually laughing?  I don't know.  Anyway, so what happened with the chick?  I have a severely twisted, seriously twisted sense of humor.  Oh, God.  I like to think I have a twisted sense of humor.  Let's get back to Patrice because I want to wrap this up so we can move on to other things.  Yeah, she wrote and she started it out.  I didn't read it because I know how I am.  If I read it, I would have been backseat driving her great.  But I read it was really good.  She was just, but it began with, I am Patrice O'Neal's fiancee. 
[01:30:00]  And then in parentheses, AKA his bitch.  And I'm here to say that I have never been maimed or beaten in the act of sex.  But she never defended that I'm a misogynist.  She never said I'm not one.  She probably tried to and her computer wouldn't let her type it.  She kept deleting.  She wrote a long thing and all of gripes.  And Andrea wrote back, I have to paraphrase, but she basically wrote back, listen, first  of all, don't shoot the messages.  Second of all, I am not a, before you give me a speech about journalistic integrity, I 
[01:30:30]  am not a journalist.  I'm a columnist.  So they're paid for their opinions.  To me, it's fine.  She's got an opinion, but it's a lousy one.  And it's one that is contradictory to her saying that she has a seriously twisted sense  of humor.  And, you know, that's, that's, do women like that have sex?  Like Gloria's all right.  I'll bet you, I'll bet you, I'll bet you not only do they have sex, but I'll bet you that 
[01:31:00]  they like their hair pulled and I'll bet you that they are just dirtbag submissive.  That's what my guess would be.  Because any woman that's running around tooting her own horn like that and just demanding  how, I guarantee you.  Like a lot, like a lot of these.  If they're straight, they're dirty subs.  A lot of these right wing guys that are against homosexuality always end up popping out of  the closet when something happens and some guy comes in and says, hey, we were having  sex.  Same thing with these women. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  They probably in bed just love a little hair tug.  We have another person that was at the show, Anna from Bayside.  As someone who attended the show, it's ironic that Twatty, Carolyn Ray and Paula Poundstone  weren't lambasted for their tacky attempts at man bashing.  Oh, was Paula Poundstone and Carolyn Ray trying to?  I wasn't even going to ask Patrice that question.  He has no clue.  I don't know.  He just waits for the first time.  I had no doubt in my mind.  You didn't see any part of the show. 
[01:32:00]  I guess that's okay because when a woman tries to hit you, you just laugh at her anyway.  You just take a little slap and you just give it right back harder.  And then Anna continues.  Put your glass ring on her cheek.  Anna continues.  They just wish they got laughs like Patrice and Louis did.  Stupid.  And then she used the C plural word.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, she went there.  Comic.  Comic kooks.  Comedians.  I can't believe by the...  Here's the Dorsen of Andrea Pizer.  She's a homely woman.  Daryl.  Mm.  Columnists like Linda Stacey.  Yeah.  And her, they're all ugly. 
[01:32:30]  None of them are sexy.  I don't know what Merle looks like, but she couldn't be ugly.  Merle can't be sexy.  How can she be?  Merle.  This is how we wrap this up.  Once again, we invite the columnists to defend themselves on the Opie and Anthony show.  It never happened.  I want to talk to Merle.  They all hide.  Let's get Merle.  We'll talk to Merle Hoffman.  We'll talk to Liz Asberg.  Abzug.  Abzug.  Abzug.  Abzug.  We'll talk to the girl that has Sari in her last name. 
[01:33:00]  Osario.  Oh, Sari.  Sonia Osario.  And the Pizer woman.  And we'll talk to the Pizer woman.  Do we try getting them all?  Merle?  All at once.  What happened?  Too early, right?  They all say that.  Oh, too early.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Patrice O'Neill, everyone.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Follow one more bite here.  Breakfast broccoli.  How long does it take to eat for everybody around this?  I hate the way you guys eat.  This place is just a grazing.  It's a pasture.  Tree-hugging hippies.  Broccoli.  Granola.  Strawberries.  I was having strawberries.  Brewers.  Nothing that's in danger of killing. 
[01:34:00]  Yogurt.  What happened to you guys?  It takes forever to chew broccoli.  Forever.  What happened to me?  I haven't put on a condom since 1992.  I heard you talk about you guys.  You got all those things checked out?  Dude, I...  How do you get away with not having anything?  It's my bleach drink.  I drink bleach every day.  You never had nothing funny pop up?  Nothing.  I had a burning one time.  It turned out to be nothing.  I realized nothing.  How does it...  Why are you lying?  There's no such thing as a burning nothing.  I had a...  The guy, not only did I get tested for diseases, 
[01:34:30]  but he checked on a cellular level,  and there was nothing.  Wow, look at that.  Because you couldn't understand why it was burning.  They thought it was like a urinary tract thing,  which they said is very rare for a guy.  Guys don't get urinary tract.  Very rare.  That's something girls get.  Very rare.  Very rare.  I thought it might be a VD, but it wasn't.  Really fast.  Got to get this plug in here.  Football Picks, sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  Here's the summary.  Jeff Daniels stinks at picking football games.  He effed me bad. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, that's right.  He's the one that picked.  I was trying to remember who picked your football picks.  I went two for five.  Steve is still in the lead for the $10,000 courtesy of Dish Network.  He's got 30 right for the season.  Travis has 29.  He's right behind Steve.  And I'm in third place with pretty much everybody else.  We're all tied for third at 25.  Somebody picked the Jets?  Who picked the Jets?  I picked Jets.  You got that right.  That's one of the ones that went wrong.  You know what, though?  I picked the Jets in another thing.  I got my football pools confused, but I picked Jets over the Pats. 
[01:35:30]  Did you really?  Yep, absolutely.  Absolutely.  You picked Atlanta to lose?  Yeah, I did.  That was the game Jeff Daniels got right for me, Eagles.  No, no, no, Atlanta.  Who did Atlanta play?  You non-football idiot, Atlanta Eagles.  No, didn't Atlanta play the Eagles?  No, Atlanta played some team, Cleveland.  Wait a minute here.  What was you watching?  Hockey.  You was watching the Ontario Booganauts play the...  Oh, yeah. 
[01:36:00]  No, what am I...  Yeah, you're right.  Louisiana.  No, you're right.  Eagles beat the Redskins.  You're right.  Stepping Wolves in a shootout.  Zero.  Ugh.  Hey, nothing wrong with hockey, black man.  Because you're black, you can't...  Hey, dude, um...  I don't know.  All right.  Quonsacchio...  The Quonsacchio knock racers are in town, man, playing the Islanders.  Are you insane?  That's like minor league hockey for all the cities that aren't fortunate enough to have  the NHL. 
[01:36:30]  The Des Moines Blinkers are playing.  You want to go check them out, dude?  The Des Moines Blink.  You're...  What is wrong with you?  Stinking games.  Making fun of the NHL.  You don't like hockey?  No one likes hockey.  No one in your community likes hockey.  No one likes hockey.  There's a difference.  White boys like hockey.  I guarantee you...  You know what it got on the thing last year, the ratings?  I think 8.6 people watched it.  But people don't watch hockey.  It's just stink.  A lot of people do.  They're watching hockey.  They go to the games.  They're not watching the Islanders because we have a crap hole for an arena, but they're 
[01:37:00]  watching hockey.  I have to defend hockey now.  TV ratings are awful for hockey.  Hockey was hot for a few minutes.  They tried to make hockey a hot sport.  They're watching hockey.  Where do you watch hockey?  It's more on a local level.  They don't do national games for the most part.  Later in the season, they will.  Where do you watch?  I don't even know where to go to watch it.  I'll tell you exactly what channel.  It's a channel...  It's like 122 when the cooking network goes off the air at 7 o'clock.  They do put it on some weird channels.  It's a weird channel that comes on.  It's like an extreme network channel. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Because let me tell you something.  I've never even seen hockey while I'm flipping.  Like, I'm flipping around looking for something.  I've never seen hockey.  But you're not into sports in general, so you don't go into the sports area of your cable  system.  I'll go through every channel sometimes just to see if there's anything on.  And I'll go through...  I mean, like, flick through.  ESPN has a lot of hockey games on.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh, LN.  What?  The Outdoor Life Network.  Thank you, sir.  What?  The Outdoor Life Network.  Oh, my God.  Is that what they've been denigrated to? 
[01:38:00]  No, what happened...  I'll tell you what happened.  It used to be on Channel 9 in New York.  Hold on, hold on.  I'll tell you what happened.  Ooh, the Grand Rapids.  No, no, no.  I'll tell you what happened.  Because I try to follow my Islanders, okay?  But if you've got the Rangers, the Devils, and the Islanders all playing at the same time,  the Islanders are on that weird channel because, like, Rangers are on, like, ESPN, and then,  you know, another, like, the Fox Sports channel has the Devils, and then next thing you know,  yeah, they have to throw the third game on some weird channel.  On the Who Cares channel.  Exactly.  Hey, by the way, who cares about hockey? 
[01:38:30]  Guys, the Vegas Rollers are coming to town.  All right, listen.  We have an awful cities.  We have Louis C.K.  He's waiting on hold here, just listening to us babble about nothing.  Talky.  Hey, Louis, what's up?  Hey, sweetie.  And the lack of interest in it.  Congrats on the print.  Oh, yeah, that was some nice ink.  That was great.  We've been talking about it all morning.  We have Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Yeah, I was very proud of that.  I thought that was awesome.  No laughing matter, my friend.  Well, you should know better than... 
[01:39:00]  I love how many, every time something happens with comedy, that's the headline.  Yeah.  The laughing matter.  That's really creative.  But this woman claims to have this really...  Twisted sense of humor.  Seriously twisted sense of humor.  Yeah.  And then just trashes you guys.  Yeah, you know, I actually thought it was if she was fair in a lot of ways.  Like, she says that Patrice got laughs.  Like, she could have just not mentioned that.  She does say he got laughs and gasps, which is true.  I was there.  Or, you know, there were people that were bumming out, but they were helping to make 
[01:39:30]  laughs, the people with senses of humor.  That happens at the women's clinics, too.  Laughs and gasps.  Yeah.  The boyfriend's laughing and high-fiving his friend while she's gasping and thinking he's  still going to stay with her because she's going through what he promised he'd stay with  her if she went through.  Do you mean if I get it taken care of, you won't break up with me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he hears that thing get plugged in, and he hears the kickstart, and he high-fives  his friend, and they leave her there.  Oh, my God.  Have some orange juice and get your own ride home, you numb morning after pill whore. 
[01:40:00]  I've just got to sell these concert tickets to pay for it.  That's times right on.  The one thing about Andrea Pizer that she fails to mention in the column, I mean, the headline  is No Laughing Matter, but Louis C.K. and Patrice O'Neill were getting huge laughs at  this show.  There was only a handful of people that weren't enjoying it.  Yeah, no, it was killing.  And the thing is that the point of having us there was not that we weren't supposed to  be there to talk about how great women's shelters are. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  We were there to put our names on the show so the people would come and see us.  And both Patrice and I, when we went on stage, got big applause going on.  And so we know that people came, paid money to that women's shelter so that they could  watch us say horrible things about women.  That's the whole point.  Right.  You know, if they had had a show where a bunch of people stand up there and talk about how  nice everybody should be, nobody would have paid any money.  So, you know, this woman that pulled her support, though, that's what makes me sick.  Yeah.  She thinks that she's fighting misogyny by taking money away from a woman's shelter. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Well, you think if Merle Hoffman would have been billed that she was going to be up on  stage and Liz Abzug was going to be up there, that the place would have packed out?  Of course not.  The thing that's funny, too, is that Merle Hoffman, it says she pulled her support.  Yeah.  She's the president of Choices Women's Clinic.  Yeah.  It's not like they had money.  She just decided to be bitter and say something crappy.  But it's not like she was pouring money into the place. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, so she just is removing her support.  Well, that's the way I read it because it doesn't.  So, you know.  No, I think she was actually, I think she said, they said she was a big financial contributor.  Maybe on a personal level, she was.  It doesn't say that on the.  No?  I thought it said she was a big, a big contributor.  I could be wrong.  No, she's just another, you know, person with a handout for women that get hit.  I tell you one thing, isn't it great, though, that she yanked all that money, and all she  did was, like, with every dollar she yanked, two more teeth got loosened. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  No kidding.  Tee hee.  There you go, girls.  Black guys for everyone because she doesn't have a sense of humor.  Yeah.  This doesn't make any sense.  It's like, I'm going to, you know, we're all here to support these women, and I thought  those guys weren't funny, so I'm taking money away from these ladies.  Yeah.  I wonder what they would have done if De Niro or somebody had volunteered to, say, be  the N.C.  Would they have objected because he beat his wife in Raging Bull?  It's once again the double standard of a comedy.  It's just revolting. 
[01:42:30]  And again, look at what Paula Poundstone was in the news for.  Well, yeah, I don't know what Paula did.  No, she was in the news for it.  It was alleged.  Alleged.  Eh, they forgave her.  They're fine with her now.  But you weren't even accused of that, and what bugged me is this woman ran a woman's  choice clinic, which is basically, it's an abortion clinic, correct?  Yeah, I guess so.  And you're talking about beating up your kid, and I'm like, well, at least they had  the thing.  God almighty, at least you guys had it and loved it and repainted the room.  She didn't even want to repaint the room.  She's like, ah, let's just leave it and study. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, wow.  What I love about the stuff they chose of mine to complain about, they obviously combed  through my act looking for something that was against women.  Yeah.  I don't talk about any women or hitting women.  But they found, oh, he hit a little girl.  So if I had done a bit about hitting my little boy, they would have said, ah, who cares?  Yeah, I wouldn't have been in there.  Yeah.  Let him hit the little faggot.  Nobody cares about boys.  I love where it says, joking about decimating his stupid four-year-old daughter by bashing 
[01:43:30]  her in the head.  It looks so good in writing.  It looks like a restraining order.  Yeah, really.  It looks like she thinks my daughter is.  Louie, do you remember that picture you took?  What's that?  That picture that's in the paper.  Do you remember that from anywhere?  Can you trace that picture back?  Like, oh, I remember this picture.  That's me from HBO special, the half hour I did two years ago.  Oh, really?  Okay, all right.  The publicity photo they got from HBO.  So HBO supplied that to help them malign me.  Yeah, because you look like a lunatic and Patrice just looks like he's ready to carjack 
[01:44:00]  you.  I know.  Patrice looks like he's going, oh, were the people there?  I didn't know.  Well, I mean, you don't want to, brilliant.  I mean, as a comic, we all know that people like, you know, Liz Abzug and Merle Hoffman,  I mean, that's basically the target audience because they're very funny people.  You know, women who are involved in social causes always have wonderful senses of humor.  Oh, they're hilarious.  That's the whole point.  The whole point of this stupid event was, let's take this out of our realm and go get 
[01:44:30]  some, you know, it was Rich Voss was there.  The bill was a dirty, nasty bunch of guys because we pull in numbers and we get money for them.  We didn't get paid to do this.  We did this for them.  And so the idea that this lady's going to, like, protest by, you know, she should just  go over to that shelter and start hitting women because she didn't think we were funny.  Well, not only should she, but I think we ought to as well.  I love women.  I don't know, man. 
[01:45:00]  You're funny.  Why is Norton, Norton has too much about being known?  No, no reason.  I mean, no, no, I didn't go through a horrible experience this weekend that I'm devastated.  No, no, no.  Oh, believe me, when it comes to a little woman bashing this week is Jimmy's week.  Oh, boy, you picked the right guy.  Yeah, this hit a perfect day for us.  I make LaMotta look like Alan Alda this week.  I can picture Norton's entire left side going out of his sock and trying to punch anything.  Sorry.  Didn't mean to laugh that hard.  That's right. 
[01:45:30]  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  You're hurting today.  I shouldn't have laughed that hard.  Nothing does comedy better than being quoted so that you can tell how funny it is in an angry article.  Because Patrice's bit is obviously healthy.  I mean, just the fact that she spelled out arg.  Yeah, arg.  I mean, it reads funny.  A lot of A's, by the way.  And it's not my, Louie, it's not even my, it's a, it's a, it's just, it's a thing.  It's one of those things.  It's going around.  It's a thing.  It's yours now, buddy.  Yeah, no kidding.  Arg.  All right, Louie.  Hey, you got any gigs coming up, man?  Yeah, I'm doing Vegas. 
[01:46:00]  I'm doing the, the, the comedy festival in Vegas.  Cool.  Me and David Teller doing a show on the 16th.  Nice.  I'll see you out there, man.  I'll be flying out there with an empty seat next to me on the plane.  So, uh, take care, man.  We'll see you there.  I'm doing the Saget show.  Oh.  Maybe the three of us can hang out since there won't be four.  Yeah.  Thanks so, so much, no.  All right.  Thank you, Louie.  Thanks so much, no.  Thanks, Louie.  By the way, before we move on, someone's got, what, what happened?  Uh, no, the empty seat.  I was pointing at, uh, pointing at Greg to see if it was the empty seat.  What?  What?  If you was the empty seat supporter. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, okay.  What is girlfriend?  I wasn't a, we didn't break up.  Oh, this is some, this is, oh, this is the problem.  You broke up with your girl.  Well.  I didn't feel no magic there anyway, dude.  Nice.  Wasn't no magic there.  I saw, I met his, I met, I, you, I'm good at that, man.  I met it.  Yeah.  There's magic with him, you and your girl.  Yeah.  Um, I never really see you guys together, you and your girl.  It's like weird.  Hope he doesn't take her out.  He doesn't, it's weird.  It's only certain circumstances.  No, no, no.  When you, no, when I see you together, it's never enough where I could get a magical, where 
[01:47:00]  I could feel something.  Well, it's usually during radio events.  Yeah.  I have to worry about so much crap.  Right.  Yeah.  But that, this new one here, cause when I first met Norton, I hated his, I hated Norton  without a, with a passion.  We did a gig up in, in, in somewhere where it snows even in the summer.  Was it college?  No.  It was someplace where he brought his girl and he was just, it was a six hour drive.  And I had no car, just got there, just met Norton.  Oh yeah.  We had met, we had met before then though.  Oh, I hated him.  And he was just, he was just oodly boodling with his girl for six hours. 
[01:47:30]  I'm in the back.  Oodly boodly.  I'm in the back like a slave, like a, like a, like a, like I'm sitting back there like,  Hey, let's do some comic talking, you know, about life.  And he's just like, and driving down route 17 with no lights.  And it's just like, but he loved that girl.  This new one there that you just broke up with.  Nah, I didn't feel it.  It was supposed to go anywhere.  I don't know, man.  I didn't feel it.  I didn't feel it at all.  I, I, I, I, I, that should help him today.  Uh, Norton, you're a celebrity, dude. 
[01:48:00]  I'm a, I'm a, uh, oh boy.  No, I'm not.  What are you hurting about?  Here he goes.  I'm a, I'm a, no, I'm not.  There it is.  What does she, what does she, what does she enable for you to miss her now?  What, what is, what do you miss?  I don't, well.  It's your own ego that's acting up.  It's not even a miss thing.  Cause I'm, I'm so angry that I, I don't think I would want to repair it even if I could.  What does she do?  She's, she's fought, you know.  What does she do?  It's good that anger's there instead of like complete, like just sadness. 
[01:48:30]  Wait, what does she do?  What did she do to you?  Oh, nothing.  Why are you mad?  We just fought.  You know how it is.  You fight and it's just ugly.  It gets ugly fast.  And you got rid of her?  It was mutual.  No, I can't say that.  It was mutual.  You're going to come crawling back to her?  No.  It's over.  Good.  We're done.  Now, replay.  Now, how many women do you think she, the void, how many, how much emptiness do you have now?  Five women?  How tall am I?  Five.  There was.  How many women do you think?  Oh my God.  How many women do you think?  Let me enjoy that one. 
[01:49:00]  How many women do you think it will take to fill that void now?  I don't know.  Let's see.  We started last night.  It's a $300.  No, man.  The chase of square girls.  You got to chase the square girls.  I completely get that, but at 2.30 in the morning, kind of hard to find a square girl.  You got to get a circle off Craigslist.  So, it was sexual emptiness?  No.  Partial, but no, no, no, no.  That's not, I can't even, I won't knock her for that.  No, that was more my thing, actually. 
[01:49:30]  No.  He doesn't want to trash either, so he's.  No, I can't.  No.  I won't.  I won't trash.  It's not Jimmy's thing.  Yeah, it was just.  It is Jimmy's thing.  Who are you, do you even know him?  No, not trashing like this close.  Oh, in like a couple of weeks?  Forget it.  Yeah, I can't.  He'll be, you know, calling her awful things.  Are you going to take her back?  He's sad.  No, she doesn't want to get back with me.  I don't want to get back with her.  There's nothing she wants to get back and I don't, or I want to, and she doesn't.  He's sad.  It all happened two nights ago, and we're not going to talk.  That's it.  I know it's it.  Look at his eyes.  Has all the stuff been removed from your place, anything that was hers? 
[01:50:00]  While we were arguing.  While you were arguing that was happening?  Wow.  Are you serious?  Wow.  Your mansion is now empty?  Well, there was never much there.  It was just a few pair of panties and, you know.  Oh, I'm going through it now, dude.  I mean, it ends up, you know, with her coats in my closet.  I'm just like, wow.  I got a million coats and jackets.  I'm looking at, what's this?  What's the girls for a coat doing in my jacket?  Sweetie, can you get your?  Wow, you're that territorial where you don't even want.  Because that's where it starts. 
[01:50:30]  It starts there.  It starts.  And then before you know it, what?  Before you know it, I can turn around and it's just, everything is everywhere.  I banish her stuff to where I never see it.  That's why Patrice is brilliant.  I banish her stuff.  Patrice is going to be doing a relationship, his relationship show in November.  In November.  Yeah.  If you had him, Black Phillip.  On SM exclusively, right.  A couple weeks.  No, a week from Saturday.  Go ahead. 
[01:51:00]  Sorry.  Mike, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  But I'm saying she knows, my girl knows that I am looking for the big fight because I've  had no other women in my house.  In my crown molding painted house.  I have had no one in there except for her and her kid.  So you're looking for the big fight.  I'm just, she knows I'm sniffing out something.  So she's got to go.  Like if you're going to have a fight with a girl.  She's a bitch, you know, and she just goes.  If you're going to have a fight with a woman, it's going to be a big one and it's going 
[01:51:30]  to be her because who else are you going to fight with?  I got to have a big fight with her so I can have some, she knows I'm waiting to have somebody  else come in there.  Are you serious?  You're not?  Your mansion's empty?  Your mansion tax house with some ungrateful stuff in your house?  Your big Panasonic TV and you all frumpy?  It's ego, stupid.  No, I say I know the ego thing.  It definitely is part of it.  But then it's this time where you just get sad because you like somebody a lot.  Maybe love them.  No, it's the banana in the tailpipe. 
[01:52:00]  Here's why she did that.  She started to fear who you are.  So she tried to control that by leaving you first, by making the move because you're in  a mansion and you're on the radio and she's like, I'm going to get out of this because  I'm a little too in love with you.  That's her problem.  She was too into you and she knows it's stupid because you told her, hey, I'm Jim  Norton and I might just not be in here, blah, blah, blah.  And she bounced to save her own life, dude.  That's what she did.  That's what they do.  A preemptive strike? 
[01:52:30]  Yes, to get out of it.  It's self-sabotage.  She's into you too much.  She loves you too much, Norton.  How the hell do you know all this stuff?  Because I know how I am.  I'm dipped in low self-esteem.  It's melting off one layer at a time every 10 years.  And I know how people do things.  Like I said, my girl is engaged to me.  I'm not engaged to her.  She feels more than a girlfriend.  For her, love for me is more than a girlfriend.  She's my girlfriend. 
[01:53:00]  I love her.  But she's just my girlfriend right now.  But I don't want to make her not feel like she needs her.  That's what's wrong with women.  Even they get to a point where they feel a certain way about you and they need you to be exactly the same level.  And it's impossible because when you take a woman out, you are auditioning everything to her and she's auditioning nothing to you.  So when she's liking you, you're not liking her back.  You know what I'm saying?  Wow.  To the same degree. 
[01:53:30]  So that she's into you, Norton.  Trust me.  She's suffering.  Where is she going to find somebody else?  You're a winner.  You win a lottery.  You understand?  What other worm does she know that has to pay mansion tax?  All right.  We got to take a break.  We're really late.  Damn.  By the way, because they're killing me here.  They're killing me here.  The hockey fans checking in.  Hockey hasn't been on ESPN in like two or three years.  No one noticed.  How could they not be showing the Nashville Strummers?  See, that just proves, you know, my Islanders never got respect because, you know, I didn't even know because I see them all on all these other crazy channels. 
[01:54:00]  And the O-L-N and Versus.  What are these channels?  The Oklahoma bottom.  No, we can't call them that.  The Detroit Licksplickities.  The Lickety-Splittities.  No one cares.  Hockey sticks.  The Arizona hotness. 
[01:54:30]  Francis from Long Island.  Patrice, did he catch the L.A. Rapist game against the Portland Baby Daddies?  Wow.  That's black hockey.  Look at a hockey player.  That's the black hockey league.  Hockey.  How did hockey just...  It's almost not a sport.  Well, they...  It's Canadian.  They decided it was time to have a little strike like all the other major sports, and it...  That hurt it.  That hurt it pretty bad.  They haven't fully come back since then.  It took baseball years to come back.  The Maguire social race helped baseball come back. 
[01:55:00]  But hockey was doing well for a while, because it was on Fox, and it was hot on Fox.  Dude, hockey was really starting to rock.  You're right.  And then they decided...  Jackasses went on strike.  They decided it's time to strike, and that was it.  And hockey owners, they don't care.  They'll just open another pizza shop.  Hockey is a hobby for the owners.  All right.  You're hurting me.  I don't know.  He might be right.  The Maine Lobsters, apparently, were drawing some big towns now.  We might not have time for a retard-hosting public-access cookie show. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, yes, we will.  Yeah, please.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show are appearing in a special holiday edition of FHM.  On sale now.  E-Rock's creepy photos from the FHM shooter now online at opieandanthony.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We just did ten minutes of hilarious, well, you can't call it radio because it wasn't on the radio. 
[01:56:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show, and we definitely appreciate that.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Can you ask that question once again for the radio?  But keep it clean because I've got to hear that answer again.  I want to ask, how do you sleep with a transvestite and not be gay?  How is that not gay?  You mean transsexual.  Transsexual.  Yeah, transvestite's a guy in a dress.  That'd be silly.  But a transsexual's fully...  Oh, transsexuals are everything.  They're fun.  They laugh a lot. 
[01:56:30]  How do you...  Wait a minute.  How do you even involve yourself with a transsexual or a transvestite and it's not gay?  And here's the finance right with the Patrice, that you live in America.  Just because you go to England, it doesn't make you a European.  You're just visiting.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You know, you've got to give it to them.  As long as you can rationalize it. 
[01:57:00]  Hey, look.  You're on that plane home.  You're not thinking, boy, I should still be in Europe.  You're like, I can't wait to get back to America.  And then deny I was ever in Europe.  Then you burn the passport, don't you?  But aren't you visiting?  What?  Aren't you visiting?  Oh, a little quick.  But isn't visiting...  Visiting.  Yeah, during the time you're visiting.  During the time you're visiting, you are...  You're seeing all the sights.  Oh, when in Rome...  I mean, you don't want to be rude.  I mean, you know, if you're in Rome, you have to do as Romans do. 
[01:57:30]  But then you leave and you go, ah, F Rome.  Yeah, but you don't invite Romans to the house.  He doesn't want to become a citizen.  No, you don't become a citizen.  Why not?  You can invite a Roman over.  You can even pay them for coming.  I get what you're saying.  Okay, so you just want to...  You just want to visit Rome from time to time.  Yeah, he doesn't want to set up shop.  He doesn't want to...  Isn't that gay?  No, are you kidding?  I would never be.  No.  I'm gay?  I'm certainly not.  Leave him alone.  Leave him alone.  Are you guys this is a good question?  I just want to...  He's teary-eyed today. 
[01:58:00]  Can't you see it in his eyes?  I just want to defend my friend Norton.  And I don't know how to rationalize it.  You know, me and my girl talk.  And, you know, we listen to the radio.  And she's like, Norton's gay.  You sleep with a transgressive...  I was like, I don't...  No, Norton's not gay.  No.  For some reason, Norton gets...  And all I do is just say no.  A pass.  Yeah.  Jim Norton gets to pull it off somehow.  He's a heterosexual guy.  Yeah.  But he gets a pass on a few things.  No, he's not gay.  Honestly, if I was, I'd tell you.  Or I'd tell her.  Or I'd tell somebody.  But maybe I'm going to tell myself. 
[01:58:30]  No, because a lot of times I look in the mirror.  I'll just wake up and I'll look in.  I'll go, you're not, you know.  And I'll walk away.  It'll work.  All right.  What do you want to do?  You want to do the cooking show?  Want to talk about K-Fed?  Want to talk about more football?  What do you want to do?  I've got to do the cooking show.  Yeah.  Right now?  K-Fed, there's no joke about K-Fed.  All right, we can save the K-Fed.  Who cares?  7,000 units sold.  Good boy.  That's terrific for him.  All right, here we go.  68 more.  100 than he should have. 
[01:59:00]  Retard hosting public access cooking show.  Yes, it's called the Merle Howard.  Merle?  Yeah, Merle.  Oh, Merle.  Howard and K-Line?  Talon?  What is it?  Whatever.  We'll look at the...  Merle Howard, are you sure it's not Moe Howard in honor of his hairdo?  Nah.  Well, it's, you know, everyone gets a show these days.  So it's retards...  Cooking.  Cooking.  Cooking.  Live from Little City Studios in Palatine, Illinois, it's the Merle Howard Kalin Show. 
[01:59:30]  When they're not playing hockey.  Host and star of the show, the great gourmet himself, Merle Kalin.  Welcome.  Hi, this is the Merle Howard Kalin Show, and I am the host, is Merle Howard Kalin.  Today, I'm going to show you how to cook a baby in the microwave.  Well, I hope he accidentally, he goes to cook five hot dogs, and then he screams because  his hand is on fire.  Stupid.  Oh, my God. 
[02:00:00]  Why don't you cook yourself some better genetics?  Oh, man.  Jimmy's in a foul mood today.  Oh, he's really dusty today.  No one's safe today.  I love it.  Jimmy's nice and dusty.  Oh.  You're in violation.  If he was any less angry, that hot dog line, you should be hitting the head with a shovel.  But his anger pulled it off.  Oh, hell yeah.  His hand is on fire.  I ought to hit you with the snare drum that that joke should have came with.  But it was hilarious. 
[02:00:30]  Even listeners out there that have water heads, they're nodding like, yeah, we've got to give  it to him today.  Oh, Norton.  We've got to give it to him today.  Norton is just an out-  He's just contiguous today.  I can't watch any shows like this.  The thought of eating any of it makes me nauseous.  Like, you know, people, we talk about this, that have kids, and the kid will have like a  cookie, and they got slobber all over it, and they give it to the parent, and the parent's  like, oh, okay, I'll have some of that, and they eat it. 
[02:01:00]  That, it disgusts me.  Just this slimy, snotty cookie.  And all I picture are, because, you know, how well can this guy wash his hands?  Does the retarded guy really know that he should wash his hands a lot?  What are you going to get from the retarded anyway?  The just slimy, gook hands.  All right, play it out.  Then what happens?  It's disgusting.  Then what happens?  Nothing happens physically.  Like, let's say a retard is eating a chocolate chip cookie and really slobbers it, gets it 
[02:01:30]  nice and moist, and then he hands it to you.  And then you take a bite.  What's going to happen, really?  What's really going to happen?  It's going to get kicked in the chest.  What's going to happen, really?  In the end, what really happened?  All right, go down on the street, let a chihuahua do something, pick it up, and eat it.  What's going to happen, really?  Well, you don't know.  You would get sick from dog poo.  That's the point I'm making.  But from a retard making a little cookie moist, nothing's going to happen to you.  Well, then the point that Anthony would bite into it and break his teeth, because the  retard was eating a rock. 
[02:02:00]  That's not a cookie.  That's all right.  He thought it was a cookie.  They do love those rocks.  Back to the tape.  Dopes.  And I am the host, Ismael Howard Kalin, and so for tonight is how to cook chicken.  The topic is how to cook chicken.  The first thing is, we got chicken here.  I realize it's smarter than you first.  And the chicken right now is filming a show called How to Get Away from a Retard.  Why did the chicken cross the road? 
[02:02:30]  So the retard following him gets hit by a truck.  Chicken here on the table.  First thing, we're going to teach you how to take the skin off the chicken. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, boy.  That's how you do it.  You take the chicken off with your fingers.  I hope someone's on the baby fingers.  Good.  Tear the skin off.  Tear the skin off.  And like this.  Then you see it was okay.  There's no fat on...  Make sure there's no fat on the chicken.  Like your tongue?  There's no fat on the chicken.  It's no good. 
[02:03:30]  And make sure there's no fat.  It'd be funny as he was de-skinning the chicken if it was just screaming.  He was holding it down by its dumb neck.  Oh, first you'll kill it.  Sorry.  And for dessert, I'm going to make brownies in my pants.  Oh, Meryl's a complete idiot.  What an adult.  Wow.  All right.  Here's the next clip.  Next thing we're doing is putting barbecue sauce on it.  What?  What is barbecue sauce, idiot?  Barbecue.  Is there no take twos in the show? 
[02:04:00]  No one knows what barbecue sauce is.  Should have been a take two in the pregnancy.  I'm sorry.  Barbecue.  Yeah.  That's annoying.  The doctor said congratulations.  It's a photo record.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, no.  By the way, I'm willing to do the moist cookie challenge. 
[02:04:30]  What's that?  I don't think we're going to find a water head, but I'll just show you that nothing happens.  What's a water head?  Dude, that is crazy.  What is a water head?  Like, is somebody with water on the brain?  They're just water heads.  Opie classifies them all into just water on the brain people, where they have, like, water on the brain.  Like a chicken cooking kid, yeah?  Is it a water head?  No, but I think this kid probably has, what? 
[02:05:00]  Is he Down syndrome?  No.  No?  No, he's just retarded.  He's just retarded?  That's the worst.  What, just?  Yeah, because, like, if somebody has Down syndrome, at least you know not to ask him directly.  Connections or anything like that.  You ever pull up to a gas station or a store and you go, excuse me, which way to Main Street?  And you go, and you're like, why do you look normal?  Right.  Why are you looking normal?  It's very obvious.  The Down syndrome people, they all look the same, but they have different wigs on. 
[02:05:30]  Because of the haircuts.  They just have different wigs.  And then, yeah.  You've got the Moe Howard.  Or the Petros.  Just retarded.  They look a little more like you and I, but they're a little slower.  Do you know how many one-sentence conversations this guy has that end in...  All right, forget it.  Forget it.  People just walk away.  All right.  Moist cookie challenge.  Moist cookie challenge.  Who's there?  Yeah, you would do that?  All right, go ahead.  All right, let's get back to this.  We're going to run out of time.  Speaking of bad things in the kitchen.  Movie's getting great reviews.  I want to dine to see it. 
[02:06:00]  King sauce on it.  Okay.  Oh, God, it's so good.  Let's see if I could get the one mixer in here.  This is difficult, Lee.  Okay, here we go.  You're barbecuing the chicken like this.  You've got to get barbecued.  Yes.  We don't want it on both sides.  We want it on one side because you get the flavor.  Flaving?  And keep the other side broiled.  Broiled?  Good.  That's how you make your chicken. 
[02:06:30]  Then you put it in the oven on those 450, then you have it ready.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  That's him retarded.  He's so coherent.  He's not totally retarded.  He's partial, I guess.  I know why I just said that.  I have no idea if that's possible.  We're getting gypped.  If this is going to be a retarded cooking show, they should really get one.  I've had to turn on the gas.  When did I turn the gas on?  At the beginning of the show? 
[02:07:00]  It's like it's too coherent.  He's so understanding each step.  We're getting ripped off.  Yeah, but he's really babbling, isn't he?  It should be like he should put the chicken in the oven and he goes, what?  And then he goes, oh, you're supposed to.  Like, everything should be backwards.  Or if it's still in the packaging he bought it in, like from the store.  The styrofoam is melting underneath it and the plastic on top.  It's got plastic on it and a Purdue sticker.  There should be a pen with a cat, a newborn, a chicken, and a dog. 
[02:07:30]  And they have to try to figure out which one is the chicken and then start from there.  Watch old sack of potato brains make a go at it.  Here's the next clip.  Making the salad.  Who doesn't like a nice salad, huh?  He's coherent, but it's one of those things where it's like it's so simple.  The guy's just, take chicken, barbecue, $4.50.  What kind of salad is he going to make?  It's probably going to be a handful of grass and two red balls.  Next, we're going to start off with the salad. 
[02:08:00]  The salad is the most important food of the day.  What?  Because it's easy to do.  The salad is an important thing to do.  Oh, my God.  You see, this is the lettuce.  You know, lettuce is really good to do.  Digging his booger fingers into the big head of lettuce.  You open up the lettuce.  You just smash it down.  I'm breathing.  Get beat. 
[02:08:30]  And peace out.  Like this.  Where he's ripping that head open.  You know, doctors would love to be able to do that to him.  Come in there.  They'd find the same stuff.  Just some leafy substance.  A few chinch bugs.  He's shredding the lettuce to match his brain.  God, can you imagine?  I mean, you've got to listen to this audio again.  It could have been his.  He could be going at his cooking partner's brain here.  We don't know.  We don't know. 
[02:09:00]  Ripping his head open.  Get the end pizza.  Like this.  And that's how you do it.  You keep on breaking the end now.  Then you open it up.  Why doesn't he just smash the head of lettuce with the helmet he's wearing?  Save a lot of time.  He's using it as the salad bowl.  The hockey helmet.  Then you open it up.  You have to take the bad pieces off the ground lettuce.  Oh, boy. 
[02:09:30]  It won't be.  Too bad we can't take the bad pieces off the earth.  That's so sad.  That's why we laugh, Patrice.  It won't be good if you have the lettuce bad parts.  Yeah, it won't be good if the lettuce bad parts.  Two minutes left in the show.  Do we have anything left?  You watch us only do two minutes.  Then he takes the lettuce and starts hitting it and calling it stupid.  Well, you know, you do what you've been taught. 
[02:10:00]  All right.  Well, we will try to move along, though.  Cutting up a cucumber.  Cucumber.  A cucumber.  I guess it's a cucumber.  A cucumber.  A hard word.  Next thing we're going to do is...  Let's...  Still get the good pieces in.  Cut up a cucumber.  This is a cucumber.  You cut up for the lettuce.  This is how you do it.  You cut up a little bit each time. 
[02:10:30]  Time.  You see, it's so good here.  His thumb's getting shorter each time.  He doesn't even notice the dolphin.  He's doing so much.  He's doing it.  Holy crap.  And at the end of the meal, he just throws it all on the ceiling.  And this is done.  A half-frozen chicken. 
[02:11:00]  Awful salad.  He looks at it and goes, who made this?  I don't want it.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, John.  What's up?  Not much.  Love you guys' show.  I would just call to say that, you know, I'm all for making fun of anyone.  But the guy's kind of, like, coherent.  So it's not really that funny.  It seems like you're stretching it out a little bit.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Guys.  Did you hear him, sir?  He said cucumber. 
[02:11:30]  Cucumber.  That's why we acknowledge that he wasn't that retarded.  Yeah, he's not, like, great.  He couldn't do a show if he was just sitting there drooling.  I'd watch it.  That's the show I'd watch.  Yeah.  As he tries to wear the chicken on his ass.  Dude, you don't think this guy's, like, right on the brink where he's just putting a show together?  He's just holding it together?  I guess.  But I would just find it funnier if, you know, he was just, you know, screwing everything up.  Right.  You know, maybe even stuttering at the same time.  Well, this is what we have. 
[02:12:00]  Come on.  So we're just making fun of it because there's a retired guy doing a cooking show.  Sorry that his mother didn't drink quite as much as you think she should have.  And how do you not laugh at the guy getting done and throwing the whole thing up on the ceiling?  God damn, that killed me.  Hey, Steve from Philly, this is going to be brutal.  It's off the Instant Feedback.  If you don't want to hear brutal, go somewhere else.  Go see what Whoopi's doing. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah, you might want to go there because Steve from Philly, he writes on the Instant Feedback.  I want to personally thank Louie and Patrice for doing that comedy show so guys like this can end up in the bucket of goo they deserve to be.  Whew.  I'm like, oh, okay.  Man.  Man, it was brutal.  Yeah.  I want to hear more cucumber.  Can we hear more of this?  Cucumber. 
[02:13:00]  No, we cannot.  We have to leave.  The galloping dum-ay.  And then we slice the mamados.  And the wutons.  Hey, now you're with us.  I like this.  I like this.  Moodons and mamados.  Oh, let's hear more of a Julia brain of child.  Fuzzy, what's up?  Fuzzy.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I hope you had a great line that didn't get enough laughs. 
[02:13:30]  And for dessert, he's going to make brownies in his pants?  Yeah.  Of course.  Well, that's the oldest retard joke going.  That's why they didn't, you know, they like the new humor.  I go old school sometimes.  Yeah, go ahead there, Patrice O'Neal.  What's the date on Thursday?  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  This Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Patrice, the Helium Comedy Club in Philadelphia, right?  Mm-hmm.  Whatever this Thursday is, I don't know.  I'm going to guess 16, 17, 18.  I'm going to think.  There's a part two?  I was just handed a part two.  Wow.  I think it's 16, 17, 18. 
[02:14:00]  This Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Helium Comedy Club.  It's a great comedy club in Philly.  Voss just went down there.  He said it's fantastic.  People are showing up.  The feedback on Voss was great, and they're going to love Patrice at Helium.  Yeah, check out Patrice.  This weekend down in the Philly area.  Actually, down in the city of Philadelphia.  Hey, part two for tomorrow.  Got to hear that.  So one, two, we got another seven clips.  Good old Merle doing his cooking over there.  Patrice, thanks for coming in today, man.  Thank you.  That was great.  Absolutely.  Let's remind the people, today's football picks were sponsored by Dish Network. 
[02:14:30]  More football for you, better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  Steve's still in first place for that $10,000.  And I guess that's it for today as far as over here goes.  If you're not joining us over at XM, man, have a great day.  Yeah.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the O.P. & Anthony Show. 
[02:15:00]  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  What?  What?  What?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The O.P. & Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden Buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the O.P. & Anthony Show. 
[02:15:30]  Hi!  It's the O.P. & Anthony Show.  The O.P. & Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Okay.  We got to say hi to Florida today.  Hi.  Who's birthday?  What's your name?  Melissa.  And how old?  25.  What part of Florida?  Port Lauderdale.  And you came up for your birthday?  Yeah.  With these creeps?  Yeah, unfortunately.  Well, have a good time.  You guys come up to XM, check out the show today.  South Carolina, you said?  Yep.  Very cool. 
[02:16:00]  We get people from all over the country every day for the walkover.  Are you cold?  A little.  Yeah, it sucks, doesn't it?  This isn't cold yet, though, Anthony.  It's cold.  It's windy and cold.  I mean, compared to...  You have gloves on!  I'm freezing.  I hate this weather.  What?  It's windy.  Sissy, anemic.  It's actually not bad, Alex.  It's really not bad.  Get the fuck out of here.  Dude, honestly, we would love to beat you up, but it's really not that cold yet. 
[02:16:30]  It's the wind.  It's the wind now, combined with the temperature dropping down.  Someone give me a temperature for today.  Don't just give me a temperature.  The wind chart factor is 65.  Dude, if it was whatever temperature it is right now, but the sun was out, and there was  no wind, it would be fine.  Look at this guy's in a sweatshirt, a t-shirt.  It's over.  Yeah, he's crazy.  It's got to be over 50 degrees.  Yeah, so.  50 in this wind.  You got winter gloves on!  50 in this wind with not a spot of sunshine, and it's fucking been raining all morning. 
[02:17:00]  It's cold.  Even Kenny's laughing at you, and he never does.  It's not bad.  Fuck it.  It's comfortable.  It is not comfortable.  I swear to God, it's comfortable.  Why are people so stupid when it comes to the cold?  We're all comfy.  I like heat.  Hotness.  Let's get over to Exit so Anthony can sit down and pee.  Thank you.  Oh, hey.  You have isotomer gloves on.  Dude, you're the only one with gloves.  I will give you $10 for every pair of gloves we see from here to Exit.  Those are girls' gloves.  Every pair of gloves we see from here to Exit, I'm going to give you $10. 
[02:17:30]  Angie Dickinson dropped one of those gloves outside of taxi.  He's ready to film.  Anthony.  Angie Dickinson.  Hold on, hold on.  Anthony has to go to a doctor because it's 57 degrees right now.  But it's windy and damp out.  $10 per pair of gloves.  With the windshield, it's 56.  Windy, damp, and no sun.  Wait.  This is what we're doing on the walkover.  Finding other people with gloves on.  You're going to be the only one.  He's giving Anthony $10 for every pair of gloves.  Every pair of gloves.  Gloves, I see.  But only white people because, you know, black people get cold. 
[02:18:00]  Well, you know, maybe that's it.  I'm Sicilian.  You know, the Moors.  Yeah.  Well, that's true.  That's true, you fucking eggplant.  That's true, you fucking cold movie.  Although Sam isn't wearing gloves.  And we know how black Sam is.  Why don't you just smoke one of those Chesterfields?  Either all or none.  You're nuts.  I need a menthol cigarette.  No, you need a clove.  Oh, my God. 
[02:18:30]  No gloves on the hippie chick?  Anthony, you used to be a gangster.  You used to fix air conditioners with your knuckles.  Maybe that's why I used to freeze my ass off and now I'm making up for it.  Why isn't anyone wearing gloves?  Anthony, roll down.  Because it's only you.  I haven't seen one pair of gloves yet.  No, $10 a pair for every pair of gloves I see today.  He has the physical demeanor of powder.  Look, I'll even wait on the corner to let another hundred people pass by.  I was really.  One person with a pair of gloves. 
[02:19:00]  I was really betting that one person would have gloves.  No, it ain't happening.  Aside from me.  $10 a pair.  I knew that was an easy bet.  You are really dressed to climb a mountain.  I'm going to conquer Everest.  And it's 57 degrees.  This guy's in short sleeves and he's slowing down.  Is it cold, sir?  Look at a black guy.  Look.  A black guy.  Is it cold out?  A natural black man without gloves on, man.  That dude has dreadlocks.  He's completely Caribbean.  Look at that.  Short-sleeved shirts over here.  Oh, aren't you cold?  Dude, these little girls are wearing short-sleeved shirts. 
[02:19:30]  Are you cold out?  Are you guys cold?  No.  You're not cold?  Look at this guy.  I'm freezing.  He's wearing gloves.  Does he look ridiculous?  A bit.  Where are you guys from with those lovely accents?  England.  Oh, hello.  You got a lovely daughter there.  And she doesn't need a coat, right?  She's got a short-sleeved shirt on, Anthony.  A little girl's got a short-sleeved shirt on.  Well, God bless her.  She's not even covering our ankles.  What's the idiot with gloves on?  What?  Hey, stupid, what's the gloves on? 
[02:20:00]  Who's got gloves?  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  Hi.  Steve C. has gloves on.  Oh, you have gloves on.  Are you cold, right?  You're from England?  It doesn't count.  I said Americans.  But you guys are used to like this kind of damp and it's warm here?  Well, that's a good chance for her, though.  They're actually tourists, so they might wear them for different reasons.  Oh, man.  They're afraid they may brush against an American Negro. 
[02:20:30]  All right, let's go.  Okay, why do you think I wear them?  Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.  He's got gloves on.  Ew.  He's got gloves on.  Steve's got the fucking worst gloves.  They're form-fitting.  Fucking horrible.  They're for his claws.  He could still grab trout in a river with them on.  He could work button-fly jeans in a rest area.  That's his workout gloves.  Steve's just going to lift anything he sees.  Steve's gloves are fucking enragingly feminine. 
[02:21:00]  And they stop at his wrist.  Oh, shit.  It's cold.  What about Jimmy J.J. Walker coming across here?  Oh, the girl.  Oh, she's fucking ass.  She's awful.  Short corduroy coat.  You're going to punch me in the head is what she's going to do.  She's terrible.  Steal my gloves.  Oh, he's cold.  There's no one with gloves.  No.  No.  Oh, he called me Jimmy Walker.  Two chicks from England.  I am the only faggot wearing gloves.  Yeah, but they were wearing, like, short-sleeved shirts. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  It's a little chilly out, but I mean.  It is cold, and why should I be uncomfortable?  Oh, look at this monster.  Wow, what a sexy gal.  This would be cold if it was June.  Nice, juicy legs, toots.  Toots.  Oh.  Jimmy's already on the prowl.  I certainly am.  Jimmy's back on the prowl.  That's what I like to hear.  Woman's got a scarf.  That means cold.  She's going to hang herself.  She's an ascot.  She's solving a crime.  Wow, we walked and saw nobody wearing gloves. 
[02:22:00]  Of course we didn't.  Of course not.  I don't get it.  Your hands are embarrassed.  Yeah, now they are.  And it's really not that bad.  No, it is.  The wind makes it cold.  It's the wind.  Danny, the wind's not even blowing.  Look at the flags.  Well, right now it's not.  Look at the flags.  Right now it's not, because we're on this side of the street.  Yeah, okay.  The old bag does.  A pair of gloves right here.  I have some gloves right there, miss.  Gloves, gloves, gloves.  All right.  $10.  She's cold. 
[02:22:30]  I'll give you $10.  And they matched her hat.  Gloves right here.  Gloves, gloves, gloves.  Gloves.  Two pairs of gloves coming up.  Two pairs of gloves.  No, we already got text out.  We already got text out.  You're wearing gloves because you're cold, right?  See?  Thank you.  All right.  So you and three chicks, Anthony.  Congratulations.  I'm not a complete idiot.  You want to borrow a tampon from one of them?  You and three chicks that are in menopause.  That's great.  Not one of them has a cunt hand that isn't great.  Anthony's a fucking vampire.  I'm wearing gloves and Roland's head is still sweating. 
[02:23:00]  You need a blood transfusion.  All right.  Roland looked like he just came out of a pyramid.  I'm really tired of Roland's meathead.  Out of a pyramid.  I'm not really tired of his helium voice.  Indy.  He has stuck the Johns.  Yeah, Nordy.  Try a black girl, dude.  I've done that many times.  Try one as your girlfriend. 
[02:23:30]  No.  Not as your fucking sexual slave.  Not as your role play.  I just couldn't take the stairs.  The stairs?  From her.  What do you mean?  Because I'm bombing on stage in front of other black people.  Believe me.  Black people hate me in the crowd.  You should try another race, man.  These white girls ain't working out for you.  They're certainly not.  Maybe get a nice PR.  How about a little fucking villain right here?  Agent?  Something like this?  Excuse me.  What base did your parents meet on? 
[02:24:00]  What war?  What helicopter did your father hustle your mother onto?  What do they call us?  Underground help?  Oh, hi, fella.  How are you?  Thank you very much, man.  It's good.  The MTA bus guy saying hi.  Hi, miss.  That's nice of him.  Let's get Norton up to speed with these girls.  Let's talk to this one right here.  Let's get Norton a girl. 
[02:24:30]  Look at this fucking head on this guy.  Oh, my God.  This guy should have been a midget.  His head should be on an 18-foot-tall man.  He was blessed with someone else's face.  That guy at the last second, that midget gene.  He needs a face transplant.  This is an 18-foot man with a tiny head somewhere.  Oh, my God.  What's going on? 
[02:25:00]  What time can we come see you unlock those kids in your trunk?  Miss?  Drop something.  Oh, God.  Oh, this is Tattletail again.  Nothing.  Oh, Tattletail.  Tattletail alert.  Tattletail alert.  He's an Asian guy with really bushy hair.  It bugs me.  Oh, my God.  Well, I don't see anymore.  I'm what they call a faggot, I guess.  What am I going to say? 
[02:25:30]  All right, lads, gentlemen.  I was chilly.  What can I say?  Hey.  Are you guys coming up here?  We are, Opie.  Where's Opie?  Ready?  I've been up here for 15 minutes.  Will you?  I'm not stupid.  It's cold out there.  Yeah, it is.  You ass.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe. 
[02:26:00]  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  We'll be right back. 
[02:26:30]  I'm Dave.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:27:00]  All right, welcome to the second half of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:27:30]  Yes, it's currently 57 degrees in New York City.  Anthony was dressed like it was, I would have to say, 20, 20 degrees. 
[02:28:00]  What's wrong, Danny?  Oh, it's over here.  Thank you.  No, it's, oh, I don't know where it is.  I gave it a fan.  Here's Travis.  Where's, uh, where's Norton sitting?  Um, I think he sits over.  I sit here or is it better?  Are you, yeah, sit near Anthony.  Good luck.  What?  Will you let Patrice in next to you?  Yeah, I don't mind Patrice in there at all.  It's just stupid guests.  Yeah, I'm only racist sometimes.  Yeah.  I'm only racist, like, right when I meet people. 
[02:28:30]  And when I get to know them.  Well, at least you get, I'm fine.  At least you try to get to know them.  That's good.  Some people don't even do that, so.  I am so pissed at that goddamn, what?  What, baby?  What?  No turkey chili.  Again?  You say it every day.  I ask every day, is anyone listening?  Yes.  Steve.  Yeah.  What is the problem with the goddamn turkey chili?  Apparently, English is not the language with which you convey this very simple message,  which I convey every single day that the turkey chili doesn't show up. 
[02:29:00]  I want it.  Then no one gets soup.  Right.  Uh-oh.  Then it all gets thrown out.  You're in violation!  Uh-oh.  I want turkey chili.  Open the window!  That's it.  Throw it out the window.  Throw it all out the fucking window.  Until I start getting turkey chili.  Wow.  Which one was that?  What did you get?  I was made by the retarded cook.  It's Seafood Dumbo.  Oh.  And I do this for you.  Thank you. 
[02:29:30]  And then I get fired.  Go ahead.  Heave it out the window.  Yeah.  I want to see that land on 57th.  Bunch of motherfuckers.  You don't care.  Scalding soup on someone's head.  Yeah.  How many millions do you have to pay for that?  Can I come back with the lawyers to see if I would actually get fired for this?  Oh, you won't.  It's all right.  Did I get fired for this?  Dude, then we'd get the fucking 10 o'clock hour.  Oh, yeah.  Good point.  We work for two companies.  I forgot.  All right. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  Let's listen closely.  I'm just waiting for someone to walk by so I can maybe, you know, hit them with them.  Give them a little splatter, some collateral damage.  I don't know, man.  Yeah, I think he's throwing soup out the window.  Plausible deniability.  Hold on.  I got it.  Yeah.  That's good.  That's good to say what the act is and then say plausible deniability. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, plausible deniability.  I might have wanted to whisper that.  But, you know, you only send it over the air.  It was smart, Ken.  I am so annoyed.  Why?  You want to pat my buttocks?  That'll cheer you up.  I was so...  Well, of course it would.  What kind are you eating, Patrice?  Gumbo.  Seafood gumbo?  Seafood gumbo.  And I didn't get my turkey chili.  What is the problem there?  I'm trying to put weight on.  I'm wasting away.  I enjoy their soup.  Well, you're not going to get that today.  I'm sorry. 
[02:31:00]  Do we have...  Does a smoothie make you happy?  Yeah, it would.  Thank you, Ken.  I want a smoothie and a Diet Coke.  I want a cup of coffee.  And a juicy kiss.  A tall.  A tall with milk.  With milk.  God, that retard thing was funny.  Well, we got a lot more to do on that.  We also have to talk about...  We got to talk about K-Fed because there's apparently a sex tape,  which someone sent me a clip of a girl sucking an unclipped cock.  Looked to be a good-sized one. 
[02:31:30]  It's supposed to be Britney.  Now, K-Fed may have...  Why am I calling him that?  Because that's his name.  It may have released that as a warning to her because you can see only part of the face.  So you don't know if it's her or not.  I got a little more of this.  And if she doesn't fess up, he'll let out the rest kind of a thing?  I'm guessing.  Is he allowed to?  I'm sure he can.  How does that work?  I don't know.  Legally, obviously, he's part of it, so...  Because they were married?  I mean, seriously, we should get a lawyer on the phone.  I bet you know he probably taped her secretly 50 times. 
[02:32:00]  I don't think you can do that, though.  Maybe not, but...  You can't use that kind of thing.  You can leak it to the internet.  You can leak it.  Leak.  Lady Di, why are you calling all morning long?  Why?  Why?  I've been trying to call you.  Why are you calling all morning long?  Why would you get the hint that we didn't want to talk to you?  Why not?  And now we're at a completely different building, and you're still calling.  Yeah.  So what do you want? 
[02:32:30]  What do you want?  No.  No, Jimmy.  Jimmy, I wanted to let you know something right now.  Okay.  Hi, Patrice, by the way.  Hello?  Don't...  How are you doing?  Don't...  Don't say hello to her.  Why did you call?  What do you want to let me know?  I wanted to let you know that I wanted to go to that show on Friday, but I could not go to the show on Friday.  Why?  What happened?  I was wondering.  Do you think anyone cares?  I could go down the show on my boyfriend.  She had to film a cooking show.  I did not have to film a cooking show.  I don't even know what that means.  You don't even know what that... 
[02:33:00]  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You said, no, I'm not filming a cooking show.  What does that mean?  I heard the show before.  All right.  So what does it mean?  All right.  About the cooking show with the retarded people on the show.  I don't have to give her credit.  No, but here's the question.  She knew that time.  Because a lot of people were wondering why you weren't at the show.  Out in a line, they were speculating that you were going to come, and you didn't come.  No, I couldn't go.  No, but there was a lot of people wondering.  Oh, my God.  What happened? 
[02:33:30]  It was totally anyway.  You had to go down the shore with your boyfriend.  It's November.  What did you do?  What did you do?  Lay on the beach until Peter showed up and tried to help you?  No, I did not, Jim.  What did you do?  DJ Newstyle, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  Where'd she go?  I saw the short clip of the Britney Spears, or the supposed Britney Spears clip, and someone  posted a link on FBA to the full clip on PornoTube, and it's sadly not Britney Spears.  I guess there's more to the clip, and they pan out. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, it's somebody else.  And then you can tell it's not her?  Yeah, they zoom in real tight on her face, and it kind of looks like Britney, but...  Is it Kayfed's hog?  Um, I don't...  I have no clue.  Ask Jimmy.  Sue!  I don't think Jimmy would know either.  All right, Jimmy.  They're saying it's not.  All right.  Uh, but they did say in the paper that he may have sex tapes or something, right?  That's what they speculate, but I don't know.  Hey, uh, Nick in Georgia, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Uh, if you go to defamer.com, they prove it that it's definitely not her. 
[02:34:30]  All right?  Screw all that.  Where can you find this clip?  Go to defamer.com.  They got the clip.  Oh, they got the clip, and then they say it's not real?  Yeah, they've got it.  They've got it linked.  All right.  Uh, Lady Di.  Yes.  Oh, how you doing?  How you doing again?  Hey, you know what?  I'm eating bread right now, and you know what you do when you eat?  I'm eating bread, too.  Bread?  Choo-choo.  I'm a butter roll right now.  She ain't got it, because her husband got run over by a train.  No, no, no. 
[02:35:00]  Stop with that already.  Yeah, no, no.  God forbid.  Stop with that.  Hey, thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers is right.  No, no, no.  Listen, listen.  Yeah, I'm listening.  Why'd you call?  Like I said, I wanted to go to Jim Norton's show.  Yeah.  But I just couldn't.  I could not make it to the show.  All right.  So we're going to.  Next time.  Oh, you had to drop in on your son, right?  She went down to the shore with her boyfriend.  Man, what a catch you are.  You found a guy that will take you to the shore in the middle of November. 
[02:35:30]  Down to the shore.  That's like where you go in the summer, you douche.  He had that house down there.  Oh, that's wonderful.  What did he do?  Put you on the beach and hoping that Riff showed up and raped you?  No.  No?  What does that mean?  No way it's like that at all.  You don't even know what that means.  Not me.  Not me.  What does that mean, what Jimmy said?  What's it mean?  I heard what Jimmy said.  What does it mean?  Going down the shore and throw me in the ocean or something like that. 
[02:36:00]  No, no.  No.  I didn't like that at all.  That's not what it means.  He had a nice reference there.  What does it mean?  What does it mean?  Yeah.  Because you laughed like you knew what it meant.  To get rid of me?  No.  And then she laughed.  Her nerves hit her.  She's awful.  All right.  We didn't find Andrew, by the way.  Someone's asking, where's Andrew?  He was supposed to be on the walkover today.  I don't know what happened with that.  He's in the library, I'm sure, reading up on something.  All right. 
[02:36:30]  Let's get into some things.  I earned that book.  Let's get into some things here.  How can we not get K-Fed in the studio for an interview?  Yeah.  How would you turn down this show?  7,000 albums.  7,000 albums he sold?  Oh.  They did the K-Fed on the 20 on 20 channel on XM.  They had to cancel a bunch of his shows.  They weren't selling tickets.  Then they just made them free shows.  And he's still out of the cancel.  Ew.  Free shows? 
[02:37:00]  Free shows.  Yeah, yeah.  They just don't care.  Well, Patrice said everyone hates him.  Patrice said earlier, you know, the whole world pretty much decided to hate this guy.  That's a weird thing.  That's hard to do.  That's unbelievable.  You think that there's a place where we all have this choice.  And 7,000 people, even though it is 7,000 people, that's a lot of people at one time.  Right.  But they...  Not even half a Dane show.  The whole world decided to hate him.  He ruined Britney Spears.  People could see he's a leech and a scumbag. 
[02:37:30]  People could just sense that.  And he's a light trash guy that wrecked this girl that everybody looked at as a hot chick.  Not love her, but you could look at pictures of her and go, she's sexy.  This guy wrecked her.  As soon as he talked...  Fucking wrecked her.  And said he was K-fed and tried to be hip-hop.  That's why everybody hated him.  They're like, no, he's just a douche.  Yeah, but aren't there other douches that...  Like Tom Cruise.  I'm not going to call him a douche.  Tom Cruise is a douche.  But isn't he the type of guy people go, ugh. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, sometimes, but he's Tom Cruise.  And people enjoy his work.  They enjoy his work.  He's earned his fame, at least.  The guy, I mean, you know, he's been acting for all those years.  So, Kevin Federline earned nothing.  Let me ask you a question.  I think Tom Cruise, personally, is what he's supposed to be.  Like, he's what Hollywood has made him.  Now, I don't know if Kevin Federline is what people are making him.  Like, I think...  What's the...  Nicolas Cage?  I think Nicolas Cage is not what they want him to be. 
[02:38:30]  You understand what I'm saying?  He's a big leading man guy.  Like, this super actor leading guy.  I don't think he is what he is.  I can't hate Tom Cruise because he is what he is.  He's a box office hit.  I can't make...  I don't know if I can make Kevin Federline what they're making him to be just because  they told me that that's what he was.  Because Britney didn't look unhappy.  She's...  He took her.  You know what?  Who fucked...  Let me tell you who's fucking up this Kevin Federline's ride.  The outskirts.  The people who are in her camp. 
[02:39:00]  The pressure.  Because she's such a publicity...  A slave to publicity.  But she was loving being this fat, white trash.  She loved...  You could see her face.  Her face was different.  She enjoyed being this frumpy pig.  And she enjoyed...  Yeah.  She didn't have to worry about being hot and all that crap.  She was enjoying this fucked upness and this guy using her and her codependency.  And finally, she started to call whatever Chase and looked at a bank account and she 
[02:39:30]  heard the money go down.  She's like...  It went from you have $25 million and then it went down to you have $24 million, $300...  She's like, holy shit.  It's going down.  I haven't done a hit record.  I'm a fat hog.  I'm hanging out with this guy.  And then, the final straw, Kevin Federline stepped up to try to make a little money for  the family.  Yeah.  And this nigga sold 7,000 copies.  That bitch said it's time to go.  And Kevin Federline stinks. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, he's really bad.  And he's using her name to further...  Imagine hooking up with a female comic.  Kevin Spears.  You imagine if you hooked up with a comedian or a chick who aspired to do comedy and you  knew she stunk, you love fucking her.  And she was using the name Patrice O'Neal and going out there and everyone knew she  was your girlfriend and representing you and she just stunk and was an embarrassing  rip-off of someone else.  That would begin to annoy you a lot.  Especially if she believed it and tried to lose the image. 
[02:40:30]  That's supposed to be...  Brittany, that's not...  It's not her.  That's a great blowjob.  Yeah, that's how I knew it wasn't her when I first saw her.  It's like, fucking, this girl is a dick-sucking.  I don't know if Brittany is sucking dick like that.  A lot of juice involved there.  I want to see that.  I want to see that whole one.  She's a trooper.  Money's shot and everything.  She certainly is.  I want to see that.  That fella was unclipped, though.  That must be a German film.  This is supposed to be a great website, too.  Defamer?  It's all sex tapes.  Is that defamer.com?  This is off porno, too.  It's just titled College Blowjob Clip. 
[02:41:00]  A.K.A. Not Brittany Spirit.  Because they got your boy, what you call it, on defamer.com.  Screech.  Yeah, right.  Did you see that one?  No, I didn't see the fucking porn.  I heard he's packing, though.  I already got major wood.  God never does things too bad to anybody.  You're going to make him a screech.  You better just give him a fucking cock and a half.  God is good like that, man.  He won't let you just completely hang.  Yeah.  You know?  He won't let you just be fucked up. 
[02:41:30]  Primordial dwarfs.  But they're packing.  Yeah, who knows?  They're probably packing.  Who knows?  But they're super smart.  I want to punch one.  And watch him go down and come back up?  No, go down.  Watch him just nuts.  What the hell are you doing that for?  Like, he'd be asking me, like, why?  Wait, wait.  Why'd you do that?  I was just standing here.  I'm a dwarf.  I'd knock him out, and he'd come to.  40 of his years later.  Let's go to Carl in Jersey.  Been out for an hour.  Carl?  Hey, what's up, man? 
[02:42:00]  What's up, Carl?  What exactly did Kevin do wrong?  If you break it down, he fucked his little honey.  He got himself a nice piece of ass.  Tied himself to her with kids, so he'll never worry about getting dough again.  And try to have a little fun.  Where's the downside?  I'll tell you why people don't like him.  Because he's a phony, and he wants to be hip-hop, and he wants respect.  He's not happy being what he is, which is the fucking, which is just the other one that  no one gives a fuck about.  If he was just quiet behind-the-scenes guy who fucked her and held her hand, he's a good-looking 
[02:42:30]  guy, people would accept that.  But he's like, yo, man, I'm cave-fad.  And he's an embarrassing wannabe.  Yeah.  And he's trying to rise above what he is.  And he doesn't have the talent to rise above what he is, and that's why people hate him.  He became famous like a girl does.  Yes.  He became famous almost as if he preys on kind of losers.  He's this Hollywood bad dude or whatever the fuck these dumb bitches are into that, you  know, get drunk and he does heroin. 
[02:43:00]  It's like the Paris Hilton tape, that guy.  Right, right.  Who is that guy?  Rick Solomon.  He was probably just with his friends, fucking around.  They said, look, you look like a leech unless you do something.  So he's getting high with his boys and says, all right, let's try this or let's try that.  Fuck, not our money.  Let's just go for it.  I don't think he really believed he was going to be a star.  He really believed he had talent because he never believed it before.  No, he did.  I disagree with you, dude.  He believed he had a star because he's like a girl.  That's what girls do that.  Girls will latch on and then try to, he was upwardly mobile guy. 
[02:43:30]  He's a fucking, like a bitch.  Yeah, dude, I think you're wrong.  If you saw that award show that Britney actually showed up and brought him out and she brought  him out as my man, not my husband, you could tell it was, she was just full of shame  doing it.  And she brought him out at the Teen Choice Awards and he performed horribly.  Yeah.  He believes it, dude.  You know what he is?  Marky Mark.  Even Marky Mark.  I'll go for it, too.  We would all go for it, too, but I wouldn't try to rap. 
[02:44:00]  I would just eat her asshole and shut my mouth.  He's Mark Wahlberg now.  Yeah, well, Carl doesn't understand.  The end game for K-Fed was to become this huge rap star.  Yes.  And it ain't going to happen.  Yes.  So, yeah, he did all that stuff, and within his circle of friends, he's the man, of course,  but what he wants from Hollywood and entertainment is not going to happen now, and it's going  to be a complete disaster.  He's a joke, and Britney is married to a joke.  Right.  When I was saying he's Mark Wahlberg...  The people that he wants respect from think he's a joke. 
[02:44:30]  That's the problem.  Britney can handle being married to a nobody.  She can't handle being married to a joke.  Remember Marky Mark back in the day?  Yeah.  When being that was cool.  Now Marky Mark is a respected actor.  Yeah, he's an actor.  But I'm saying, Kevin Federline, he's 15 years too late.  But even Marky Mark put out a genuine hit, though.  Even though we didn't like it, it wasn't financial security.  No, I'm not disrespecting Marky Mark.  I'm saying that what Marky Mark was, when it was cool to be that, like a hip... 
[02:45:00]  Like Vanilla Ice.  Like when Vanilla Ice could never exist now.  No, you look at that.  Like a phony white boy.  Like a phony white boy.  That's what I mean.  He is 15 years past.  Right.  Kevin Federline is what Marky Mark used to be when it was in.  And Vanilla Ice was actually legit back then.  He actually had credibility.  Right.  And you look at it now and go...  He still does.  Oh, my God.  Shut the fuck up.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Did you tell me...  I dare you to not tap your feet tonight.  I challenge you.  All right.  I'm tapping.  All right.  Enough on K-Fed.  He's done.  No.  He's done.  I want K-Fed in the studio. 
[02:45:30]  I want to do an hour more on him.  Done.  I want to...  I just want to make...  See, this is the thing.  I want to...  I wish I could just hit the lottery for a second.  One day...  And make guys like this famous.  Like, bring them back.  Like Quentin Tarantino did and does.  Like, I'm just going to say...  Oh, yeah.  Kevin Federline is not finished.  I'm going to make him act.  I'm going to make him do good acting.  I'm going to put him in a movie.  He's going to fucking get critical acclaim, and I'm going to fucking put him in a goddamn  movie and make him famous.  Like John Travolta.  Like, they took that fucking B actor and made him into... 
[02:46:00]  John Travolta was making those stupid fucking talking baby movies.  Yeah.  And Tarantino...  First one was a hit, though.  Yeah, a massive hit.  And it was a comeback for him.  He had...  After Saturday Night Fever in Greece, Travolta paid his dues in Hollywood, man.  It was all about making a comeback for that point.  Let's go to IMDb.  He had some disasters.  Oh, my God.  Staying Alive sucked a dick.  Right.  A lot of films.  It was one of the worst sequels ever.  Yep.  We should take a break, because we're not safe.  They might be taking the PSPs away from us because of the kids.  Oh, no. 
[02:46:30]  Have you heard of this one yet?  Oh, porno?  Porno.  They're calling it the PlayStation Pornable.  Ooh.  Pornable.  That sounds like portable.  I don't know.  I see.  A little bit.  Someone's saying K-Fed's a male gold digger.  Yeah, but I don't even mind that.  Roman has it.  He was cheating on Britney.  Of course he was.  She was pregnant in a mess.  He's dumb, though.  When you got Britney money.  Better be with Christina Aguilera.  When you're fucking Britney, and you got that, just fucking shut your greedy face.  You pumped a couple of kids out of her.  Fucking just bang her.  She's a sex symbol. 
[02:47:00]  All that money just to stay in some kind of shape and fuck her and be famous.  And what a great gig.  Stop aspiring to be something.  You're a nobody.  And you know he didn't want to have another kid.  He didn't want to have another kid.  He did that to kind of make sure he always has a connection with her.  Yeah.  So the money will continue flowing on some level.  Not like he was.  Unless he has custody, he's not getting no fucking money.  He's not going to get an alimony.  Really?  You don't think Britney's going to be looking at these kids and going, oh, jeez, I got  to take care of schmucko over here.  Oh, no.  He'll get an alimony.  He'll get an alimony.  Fuck no.  I guarantee that's going to play into it. 
[02:47:30]  Because of the people that made her get rich.  I'm not saying he's going to be filthy rich, but she's going to look in the eyes of that  kid every day.  And the kid's going to be like, where's daddy?  And daddy's over here.  You don't think daddy's going to get something out of that?  Daddy is the Mexican maid that she has taking care of her kids that she'll never fucking  see.  You think she's going to be a, I understand what you're saying, but you think Britney  could do that?  Where she could just like not walk away from it?  She's white trash.  I mean, where she can walk away?  If she could get welfare to pay her enough as a hit album, she'd take it. 
[02:48:00]  She's a, she'll live in a trailer.  A golden trailer.  She is trash.  She is, she wants, she is a mess.  But he did that to, you know, he's assuming that'll, that'll help him keep the flow,  you know, the cash flowing.  What cow?  What cash?  What cash?  Britney's cash.  He ain't making it.  What do you even call it?  What do you call the cash that she's going to be giving him?  That kind of shit has a name.  Is it, is it, is it, is it alimony?  Is it palimony?  They're saying the prenup was so ironclad that he's going to get, he's going to walk away 
[02:48:30]  with nothing.  Nothing.  So you think Britney's going to allow him to completely go into like, uh, of course.  It depends on what it, two things.  The only reason is because they have a kid together.  That's their kids.  That's the only thing.  That's the only thing.  If, if they didn't have kids, oh, she would love to see him rot in a, in a trailer park  somewhere.  Absolutely.  I get that.  He's, and he's fucking that black girl again that he was, dude, that he has a kid by in  the first place.  She's not stable enough to, to just, you know, let him, let him leave and rot knowing they  had a kid together. 
[02:49:00]  Might a bit, might, might be though the conditions that they left on.  If he's fucking around and shit like that, she's going to say, she's going to fall in  love again.  She'll be in this great relationship.  I agree with that.  Blah, blah, blah.  But she'll see these kids and they're going to be like, where's my daddy?  Well, he's in this trailer park over.  Well, why aren't you taking care of daddy?  I guarantee Britney baby will work to get her back.  Britney baby.  Britney baby means some type of cash.  Come on, baby.  Britney, come on, baby.  Yeah, everyone's saying, let's move on.  We're talking about K-Fed way too long, but. 
[02:49:30]  All right.  I mean, you know, that's how I say it.  Man, fuck the listeners.  We'll talk about weird ones.  They say fucking move on when we talk about anything.  Yeah.  Hey, Willie from Michigan, go fuck your cock, your cock sucking father's asshole.  Yeah, you complain when we don't talk about anything and then you complain when we  fuck you and you shut up.  Shut up, motherfucker.  All right.  You're deciding we should move on now, Willie?  Willie.  Yeah, I just think I'm done with the view talk here, ladies.  The view talk, ladies.  Go shove it up your ass, Willie.  Go shit in your hat.  Good language for your mother.  I kind of agree with Willie. 
[02:50:00]  Ah, fuck Willie.  I don't know.  Willie's a cunt.  We might as well start, you know, listen to these fucking jizz buckets.  Sinking up and having our periods together.  All right, Willie.  Yeah, I got to drop the cycles, boys.  All right, shut up.  All right, when we get back, let's talk about the PSP.  Well, it better be good then.  PSP.  PS porn?  Yeah, I think this will be pretty good.  All right.  Because the news is just ridiculous.  Oh, I don't know.  I'm concerned about the children.  Got to protect the children.  I like that goddamn retard.  The latest protecting the children.  We could continue with that.  Nah. 
[02:50:30]  Why don't we bring the second half of those clips?  We could do that.  It's whatever we're doing.  Patrice.  Playing Helium Comedy Club, starring Thursday night in Philly.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Sunday show?  No.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Helium Comedy Club in Philly.  Thank you.  Ah-ha, no soup.  Huzzah!  I got to cast a spell on you.  I'll run ye through.  Four damage.  You're not even double dual wielding.  Plastic sword.  Two damage.  Two damage.  I cast a spell. 
[02:51:00]  Bam with my beanbag.  I just cast a spell.  You've slowed me.  Now I cannot hit you as quickly.  Four damage.  Four damage.  Two damage.  Two damage.  Ooh, my arm.  I wish you were dead.  Do ye?  Over here, Anthony!  All right.  Yammer.  Yammer.  CNN just showed a montage of police beatings. 
[02:51:30]  Well, the latest one is a couple of cops got in trouble.  Video ended up on YouTube of cops trying to cuff this guy.  And the guy was resisting, apparently, from what I could see from the video.  And one of the cops was just pounding this guy in the face with his fist.  And the guy still wouldn't put his friggin' arms around his back.  What are you supposed to do?  The police were doing a good job on this particular situation.  Roll him over. 
[02:52:00]  Right.  I think the police were doing a good job in this particular situation.  You could see they were trying to grab his arm.  Yeah.  He was resisting.  Now, I'm saying, thank God he's a white guy.  Thank God he's a white guy.  He's an Arab.  And then they showed a close-up of him, and he looked like an Arab, which then would seem  like the cops would get a medal.  But then they started showing a montage of clips of black leaders talking about this.  There's a lawyer named Kwaku Duren.  Whenever you have a black person with a K and a W in his first name, you're finished. 
[02:52:30]  There's trouble.  It's a made-up name.  No, he didn't call Kwaku.  So they showed some clips then of some past police beatings.  They showed the one where the black guy is on the hood of the car, and a white officer  just clocked him in the side of the face as he was cuffed.  That was a great shot.  Boom.  And then what I like to call the Godfather movie of all beatings, the Rodney King beating.  And then some other beating out in a field where there's a helicopter.  I don't know. 
[02:53:00]  These cops.  It was a kick.  When there's a helicopter above the scene and the spotlight is shining on the guy, you  shouldn't hit him.  I'm thinking maybe the cops should have some restraint.  But I've seen a lot of these things, these chases and a lot of these cop video shows.  And when you're chasing a guy and he's almost killed two or three of your fucking partners  and you finally get him down and he puts his hands up or gets out of the car and goes, 
[02:53:30]  all right, they are, the cops are so pumped and full of adrenaline.  So what, man?  You punch him in the fucking face is what you do.  They're trained to not, they're not supposed to have emotions, dude.  I'm supposed to be able to shoot at a cop and not kill him.  And they get me and I'm supposed to go, hey, I tried to kill you, but I didn't.  Perfect world, my man.  You got me.  You got me, officer.  Not even in a perfect world.  That's not realistic.  They're human beings.  You've got to fucking win.  You can't have that kind of domain over somebody's personal space and call yourself a human being. 
[02:54:00]  You should think it.  I should be able to smack him in his face if I think he's out of line.  Then it would happen a lot more often.  Who's able to, can I punch a cop in the face if I think he's out of line?  No.  We give them a certain, we give them certain liberties.  The public.  As the public.  We the people.  You watch American History X.  We the people.  Edward Norton's character had a great speech in that.  A couple of great speeches in that.  But one was about the police and how we give them certain latitude to do things, to keep the peace, things that we wouldn't do as people. 
[02:54:30]  We give them certain liberties.  What would you do that a cop would do?  We give them certain liberties.  Chase criminals and then when they catch them, work them over a little bit.  But they only chase criminals, you would chase a criminal if I told you that that was what you're supposed to do.  No.  No.  They chase criminals that are hurting people other than them and their families.  I would protect someone close to me if I had to or tried to, but I wouldn't protect a stranger and endanger myself.  Most of the time, that's not what they're doing.  Most of the time, they're fucking with me because I got a legal tent. 
[02:55:00]  Because I don't want anybody to look at my fucking truck.  Why do you have an illegal tent?  Because of me.  Do they stop you for a legal tent?  They fucking stop me all the time for a legal tent.  I got stopped for that when I had my...  You should have a legal tent.  You should have a legal tent.  You should have a legal tent.  You should have a legal tent.  My tent is perfectly legal on the caddy.  I'm legal tent caddy kid.  You are.  But you should be able to have a little bit of...  They don't spend most of their time chasing...  Okay, when there's some real criminal shit going on, they have to.  They can't go, hey, I ain't got nothing to do with this fucking shit. 
[02:55:30]  But I'm going to tell you something.  They can't do it from New Orleans.  If you see a felony happen, you can, as a...  Really, as a citizen, you are supposed to help.  Stop felonies.  You can't just turn your back on a fucking felony.  That's against the law.  You watch me.  I'll turn around and walk away.  That's what I'm saying.  The only time they really do their job is because they're supposed to.  They don't go above it.  They go above and beyond the call of duty when it comes to fucking with you. 
[02:56:00]  When it comes to sitting in a bush and coming out and saying, dude, I can't see your license plate.  But just by doing their job properly, though, when they are doing it properly, they are literally walking up to cars and people who a lot of times will have guns.  I mean, they are walking.  Every time they approach a car, they can be shot.  You just don't know, right?  You don't know.  That's a job where you don't know.  Stay trooper on a highway at 3 in the morning is a motherfucker.  That's a scary job.  I mean, I'll probably shoot a few motherfuckers.  Some people get shot just because I'm, oh, just on some old, some old man-tand-morland shit from the fucking Three Stooges. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, feet's no family.  What you doing over there?  Bah, bah.  You know, but just I'm saying that there should be a lot more that goes into being able to be a cop.  Okay.  First of all, no ex-bullied motherfuckers should be a cop.  Only guys that look like Kenny should be cops.  Guys that have been able to physically impose themselves upon people. 
[02:57:00]  But little, small nothings with this Napoleon thing.  No Napoleon cops.  You should be six feet tall to be a cop.  All right, listen.  Let's go to Willie in Oklahoma.  Willie.  Six feet tall.  Yeah, I was wondering if, uh, Patrice's tent there, would that be because he's black or?  Well, he's talking about his windows.  No, not illegal tents being your skin, he is saying.  My illegal tent?  Oh, my.  Actually, you know what?  That, you might have something new.  That might be New Street Slang, you fucking asshole. 
[02:57:30]  You might create it.  Yo, dog, you stopped me because my motherfucking, the tent of my skin, nigga.  Some white dude from Oklahoma named Willie.  Illegal tent.  Came up with the latest one for you, boys.  You know what, that's some new shit and I'm taking it to you.  Take it.  They pulled me over because they got that illegal tent.  And you can do that with girls, too.  Yeah.  Damn, dog, I like that little tent on her skin.  I like that.  There you go.  Good job.  Well, no, you could describe them like that, too.  Like, if you got, like, a real light fucking chick, you're like, oh, man, she's a legal  tent.  Yeah, she's got a legal tent.  One of those fucking dark chicks with really short hair, ah, she's got an old limo tent over 
[02:58:00]  there.  Old limo tent.  I don't want to fuck limo tent.  My dick has two different tents.  That's not even on a black guy.  It's not even, it's, on black guys, it's limo, tent, and then pink.  Joe and Philly, what's up?  Open window?  You got the phones rolling there.  Hey, what's up, Joe?  Joe, what's up?  Yeah, listen, I just wanted to call in.  Patrice, you have no idea what you're talking about.  I've been a cop for 19 years in Philadelphia.  Oh, shit. 
[02:58:30]  I honestly think that we wake up in the morning and start our tour of duty or go to work each  day and say, who am I going to fuck with this?  Absolutely.  You really think that?  Yeah.  No, it's absolutely not true, man.  I'm just, look at, I'm not, look at, I'm general, I'm sorry, I'm generalizing, I'm generalizing,  but you don't need to, you don't need to, like, when you generalize, you're considering  that there are some great cops, man.  But for the most part, dude, okay, put it this, let me ask you this question. 
[02:59:00]  You don't think there are any cops that go out during the day and go, I'm just going  to be a fucking dick and fuck with my wife, fuck with me this morning, some, the bill  collector, fuck with me.  You don't think there's any cops like the dude from Crash, Matt Dillon from Crash, there  aren't any.  Well, that was a movie, Patrice.  I know, it was a movie, Mr. All of a sudden, Philadelphia fucking, Jesus, all of a sudden.  You're going there Thursday, Patrice.  I know, but I'm saying, look at, man, I'm saying, I'm not saying, hey, fat boy, there 
[02:59:30]  are some cops who are pieces of shit, and there's some that are not, you know, fair  enough, not all of you.  Let's go to Pete in New York, Pete.  Patrice, what's going on, guys, boys, I love the show, Patrice, I have an exception to  your remarks, man.  You know why we don't like tinted windows?  Because when people like anyone rob a store and they have a gun in their car, we won't  say people like you, anyone else pick up money?  Yeah. 
[03:00:00]  He almost said people like me.  People like you.  People like you.  People like you are robbing fucking places.  You almost fucked up.  You caught yourself.  I call myself good, but I'm saying, when people who like to rob banks and hide guns in their  cars have the guns in the car, we like to see them before we get shot.  All right, fair enough.  And as a law-abiding, as a breaking the law, law-abiding citizen, I'm one of those guys,  I don't follow law to the T, but it's like, I know when you come up to my car, I roll down 
[03:00:30]  every window I need to, so you can see in the car, I do that shit.  And then they probably go, look, this motherfucker's trying to hide his tints.  No, but I'm saying so that he doesn't, I know that's why they don't like tints, you  want to be able to see in the car, but you gotta understand, if motherfuckers rob your  car, don't you understand?  And people look in your car and break into it, because they can see right in it.  And don't you want those people to get their face smashed in by the cops?  Uh-huh.  I would.  If someone fucking robbed you a big truck years back and my stereo was gone, all I wanted 
[03:01:00]  was that guy to get pounded.  All right, let's make a deal.  Let's make a deal right now.  All right.  Let's make a deal.  Here we go.  I, I, can you understand, okay, I grew up a black guy in Boston, okay?  Mm-hmm, I'm not going to say, and especially since I've been doing comedy and been in this  world, and then especially doing radio for mostly white people, you know what I mean?  A lot of white guys know me.  So I meet a lot of fucking police now that I don't dislike. 
[03:01:30]  But if I'm a regular fucking dude, man, I don't get to meet the cops that are okay.  I don't get to meet Kenny's and the fucking other, you know, fat boy and the other, other  little Joe and Pete, I don't, I don't get to meet him.  I don't get to be like, oh, oh, dude, you're the guy from this one and that one.  I don't, I got lucky.  I'm lucky to, but for the most part, you don't think, like in Philly, dude, ask Keith Robinson,  man, he live in Philly.  It's a mess.  Keith is the worst example. 
[03:02:00]  Keith yells at the cops when they pull him over.  Keith is a bad example.  Keith yells at the cops.  Keith is a piece of shit.  And the cops have a lot of problems with black people in Philly.  So when you pull over a car with like five black guys in it, you're going to probably  give them more shit than you would black guys.  Do you think black guys have a problem because, what do you think, we're out of control?  Like, we have a problem because we're out of control?  I think there's a disproportionate number of black guys that are out of control as opposed 
[03:02:30]  to white people that are out of control.  We're more of the population.  Young thug culture is celebrated, whereas a lot of violence, I'm not saying it's not  celebrated with white people, with mafia and all that stuff, but young wild gang thug  culture in the black community is celebrated a lot more and glorified a lot more than  like, maybe white gangs were in the 50s or all this shit, or bikers were in the 60s.  Juvies.  But that whole culture is celebrated on MTV.  It's celebrated everywhere by white people and by black people. 
[03:03:00]  They love that young thug culture.  So yeah, there is a lot more wild behavior.  There are these fucking tapes in the 60s of fucking cops doing the tango on motherfuckers  in the 60s, yeah.  In the 60s.  But it's, but, but.  It doesn't, I don't, I don't think that kind of shit's going on.  I think black guys are getting hassled in their cars, but I also think that there's this  attitude that comes off.  I've been pulled over with Keith.  I've been pulled over with Keith.  Would I have an attitude?  I can't tell.  If you were fucked with all the time?  That's something I can't even say because I'm not black. 
[03:03:30]  I don't know.  And that's something I'll never understand.  So you're probably a better judge of that than Anthony.  Yeah, but Anthony, the Moors.  The Moors.  Yeah, the Moors.  You know, the Moors.  But I'll tell you one thing.  I've never been disrespectful when I've been pulled over.  And I've had some disrespectful cops to me.  And I continue to be respectful.  It might be an age thing because I am certain.  I used to, I lost a little bit of, ever since, you know, you buy a house and you get a little  older.  You lost a little of your fire. 
[03:04:00]  I used to, like, when my credit was bad and I thought that that was what life was and  a bill collector with a car, I go, suck my left ball, bitch.  Let me tell you something.  I'm sticking my asshole in the phone and I want you to stick your tongue on me.  And ever since I started seeing my credit limit creep up, 600 here, 650, and somebody  goes, you know you can buy a house with that.  And once I start thinking about a house, and then one time a bill collector called, it  was from an AT&T bill that they called and I told them to lick my ass, right? 
[03:04:30]  And they would call and the day I said, boy, I can fix it up, I just went, you know, this  isn't fair, but, you know, I'm just going to want to just get rid of this because it's  just, it's just ridiculous.  Work out something with you now.  I'm going to work out something with you.  And I understand I'm less aggressive with the cops because I got shit that I need the  cops to come help.  Like this guy in Philly, I don't want to, if something happens to me with one of these  psychopaths in Philly, I want him to come and try to help me out.  You know, I don't want him to go hide the fucking, whatever the call, it's a 182, somebody's 
[03:05:00]  fucking up Patrice, you know what I mean?  So, listen, you know.  Let's go to the answer feedback.  First of all, big doodles, Jay, to the cop that called from Philly, Rocky was also a  movie too, asshole.  But it seems real to you fuckers.  Bash in Philly.  Yeah, the Philly bash in the number of hands.  Oh, that was a good, thank you, man.  And Joe Wagner from Whack Bag, tell Patrice the New Jersey State Police actually used to  have a minimum height requirement along with a lot of other stuff, but the stupid, bleeding  heart said it was discriminatory. 
[03:05:30]  Police agencies have been made to lower their standards.  Give me a big motherfucker to protect my shit.  With that, we say how to keep the cop.  Keith?  Yeah, and that was the same in the city too.  You used to have to be like six foot two in Irish to get the job.  But, you know, it comes around.  Times change.  But, you know, like what Patrice is saying, the other night I pull a guy over.  I'm in the right-hand lane at a red light.  This dude comes ripping up on the right-hand side in the parking lane, goes all the way  across four lanes of traffic, all the way back and forth. 
[03:06:00]  He chases him out six, seven blocks.  I pull him over.  He happened to be a black gentleman with dark tint.  And the first thing is, can I know what I'm being stopped for?  What are you being stopped for?  You know what you're being stopped for, but that attitude that's got to come with being,  you know.  Hey, Keith, let me ask you a question.  Inside information, I mean, this is on the record, off the record, whatever.  Aren't there some acceptable fucking crimes? 
[03:06:30]  Aren't there some crimes that you go, aren't there some discretionary, like, you know what,  he just turned without a blinker.  Fuck it.  Let's go.  Like, don't you decide when you're going to fucking.  Dude, that has happened to every single person listening to us right now.  You're in your car and you know, oh, fuck, I did that right in front of a cop.  You see the cops saw you and they let you go.  I do a lot of shit now.  But not even stop.  Like, where you just, where a cop goes, this guy is breaking a fucking law.  I don't feel like fucking.  Happens a lot.  But is that, but should they just vote for every law that's being broke? 
[03:07:00]  That's what I'm saying.  But how many times have you flown by a cop going 75, whatever, on the highway?  He's there with his gun and just decides not to go after you.  Never.  Oh, they let you go sometimes.  They don't pull you over there.  State troopers are different, dude.  They don't fuck around, man.  They don't look for someone going faster.  Yeah, and a lot of times, you know, you may get out of the car and you may go up to the car.  And it's the attitude that dictates whether or not you're going to get the ticket.  Did you give the guy a ticket?  Actually, I didn't give him a ticket because, you know, I was busy.  I was going to do something else.  Was he a dick to you or was he nice for you to give him the ticket?  You know, once he started with his attitude and then I came back with, you know, the law attitude of it, 
[03:07:30]  he then calmed down.  He wasn't so uppity anymore.  Uppity?  Nick, do you even know you were supposed to say uppity?  Jesus, Keith.  Uppity's a good word.  Let's call a spade a spade.  I'm hanging up on Keith to save his job.  It's very just scripted.  They're very uppity.  You're going to be fucking Keith, the mall security guard.  Keep talking. 
[03:08:00]  So this guy, you know, comes out of Sears, right?  And he's running down the hallway.  So I got to stop him.  Yeah.  That'll be his next story.  We like Keith too much.  We hung up on him.  Fucking Forest Ranger hat on.  Let's go to Matt in Kentucky.  Matt.  Oh, geez.  Hey there, Matt.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good, Matt.  I love you, Patrice.  You're great.  Your life is hilarious.  And the reason I called, you guys are going to believe that we're in Pike County, a midget  for a deputy sheriff.  A midget.  Deputy sheriff? 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  That's correct.  Is he online?  We got to see a picture.  You ought to see her standing beside her partner.  It's a her?  Her?  Oh, my God.  I know why they hired her, by the way.  Because her partner wants his dick sucked.  And she stands there and he just fucks her mouth with her.  He pins her against the door and fucks her in the mouth.  And his knees tink against her little fucking, her little star.  It's because she covers every, like, group that they have to hire.  Yep.  What county?  Is she black?  She has to be black.  What county?  Pike County.  What? 
[03:09:00]  Pike County.  Pike?  Yeah, P-I-K-E.  Oh, Pike County.  Is she appalling all blacks?  Move to Pike County.  Female midget deputy sheriff.  Oh, my God.  Every time she's involved in a shooting and the grand jury gets together, the victim comes  in with two kneecaps gone.  It's like only kneecap shots.  Pull over.  I said pull over.  What?  Oh, you know she's just extra nasty.  Oh, you know she is.  Do you know how fashion we're going? 
[03:09:30]  Driver, driver, put both hands down the vehicle and hold your car keys out.  What?  What?  What?  Hold your keys out the window.  Who's talking to me?  What?  Who's talking to me?  It's me.  Who's talking to me?  What?  Down here.  God, is that you?  Down here.  Oh.  No.  Passenger, step out of the vehicle and get on your knees.  Not for security, just so I can talk to you face to face.  Put your hands where I can see them, like on your ankles.  Fucking twerp. 
[03:10:00]  Shut your mouth.  Give you a good mouth fucking against the car.  Does she need a special huge trigger guard around her trigger for that big fat socket finger?  You know how many times her fat fingers have gotten stuck in that gun?  She probably does have to have a special gun.  What about special pedals?  Just fumbling with the bullets and they're falling all over because those sausage fingers  can't shove at him.  Those little big muffin hands.  Muffin hands.  The only way she can protect you is because you allow her to just be a car.  Yeah, yeah.  Or the criminal is laughing too hard. 
[03:10:30]  He can't run.  He just laughs.  Look at the little thing.  He's laughing his ass off.  Look at the little thing.  Could you imagine seeing her running after a perp down the street?  Hey, stop.  Stop in the name of the law.  Police, stop.  She has her gun belt on.  Her gun is scraping the ground.  She's dragging it like a little child wearing its mother's clothing.  No, I said that her little fat ass.  Her little fat midget ass.  Yeah, that fat midget ass.  Yeah.  With those small little legs.  Little fucking taking way too much up cop pants she has to wear. 
[03:11:00]  They're like cop shorts.  They should give her the fucking postal shorts and she wears them.  She wears a 34 inch waist and an 8 inch lock.  Oh, she's fucking horrible.  Her little fat midget ass.  She wears Lieutenant Dan's old pants.  Little fucking.  That's great.  That was fucking crazy.  Anything else you can tell us about the fidget?  Matt.  Yes.  Anything else you can.  No, let's go, guys.  I'm punching out.  Jesus, Matt. 
[03:11:30]  It could have helped us along a little bit.  There's another county that has a midget cop.  Joe in Rockland.  Hey, what's up, guys?  This is Joe.  Hey, Joe.  How are you?  Listen, you want to know how messed up the NYPD is?  They have a midget who went through the academy about two classes ago.  And apparently she could not get over a foot foot wall.  So what they did was they have this test, this physical test that everybody must pass.  Well, what they did was everybody went and everybody passed except for this girl. 
[03:12:00]  What they did was they locked up the door.  They locked the gym with just her and the instructors.  Then they put in a little step ladder in order for her to get over the wall.  That's good because that's what a purple will do when she's chasing him.  He'll put a little ladder down and say, go ahead, hop over, toots.  And now she's working out by either the 7-3 or the 7-5 out in East New York.  You know what she should be?  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Ben.  She's getting chased every day by some crack dealer out in the corner every day. 
[03:12:30]  I would just stick my pit bull on her.  You know what she ought to do?  She ought to be a police mascot.  She ought to paint her face orange and run around yelling positive things about the police  and the station to amuse the officers.  She should be forced to run around with an orange face.  Or do the job William Dafoe did in Platoon.  Just crawl around in holes and find them.  Find bad guys in little holes.  She should be like a drug-sniffing midget.  When she trains and they just put her on a leash at the airport.  That's right.  Let her smell your baggage.  And she opens your suitcase and walks through it. 
[03:13:00]  She sniffs it.  Sniffs it.  It's coke.  I'm smelling some cocaine and dirty underwear.  We're going to have to check your bag.  Hey, can I read a few of these when there's some feedback?  The boys are on top of this one today.  Patsy from Brooklyn.  The crook is laughing, hyperventilating in the back of the police car.  There would be no need for her to chase.  Kevin from Connecticut.  I would run away backwards so I could watch the midget cop run.  Tim from Boston.  You could. 
[03:13:30]  You could probably still get away by running backwards and get a good laugh watching her run.  But those little elbows, those misshapen bony elbows rocking back and forth sideways.  They're killing on the answer feedback.  Tim.  Wow.  And it's updating way too fast.  I lost Tim's.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Tim from Boston.  The short, stubby arm of the law.  And Meat Stick from Coatesville.  Stop in the name of the Lollipop Guild.  Oh, twerp. 
[03:14:00]  That's just great.  Can't have a midget cop.  Of course you can't.  You just got to give up on society when they start lowering the standards.  You know what they should do at midget cops?  To get into the police academy.  If you're a midget cop, they should put you on top of the desk.  And whenever a cop walks by, if he's bummed out, you should be forced to do a little midget dance to make him happy.  Like you're a Christmas ornament.  They should dress you in whatever seasonal garb is appropriate.  Yeah.  Like curly cop shoes.  Like, yeah.  With a little hat for a Christmas elf.  You know those fucking wind-up Santas? 
[03:14:30]  That's what you should do.  You should dress like that when a fucking cop goes like that.  You should be forced to sing a Christmas song and dance on the fucking top of the police blotter desk.  Oh, my God.  Mr. Torrance from Wackbag.  Always good for one.  Oh, an update.  Damn it.  Okay.  She should be forced to walk the beat with the stepladder strapped to her back.  In case she needs to get up on a curb or something.  I don't know if you put water on her, does she turn into other cops? 
[03:15:00]  Don't feed her after midnight.  Oh, God.  All right.  There's always one.  Debbie from New York.  What's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hi, Debbie.  I'm 4'11".  Jimmy, you know how short I am.  I do.  And you know what?  I don't believe that if you can't pass those standards, which I did, that's just crap.  I passed all the standards.  I actually won the physical training award.  You know, yes, I get a lot of jokes because I'm short. 
[03:15:30]  But you've got to keep up.  Are you a midget?  No, I'm not a midget.  No, she's not.  I know her.  She's not.  She's actually not a midget.  Sorry.  Debbie's a midget.  4'11"?  4'11 is officially midget zone.  No.  Look it up.  What's a midget?  Anyone under?  Oh, 4'9".  Are you sure?  What did you run the 4'9"?  I heard anyone under 5' is in the midget category.  You're a tall midget, but...  I can chase them.  You know, she's in amazing physical shape.  I've got to vouch for her.  She's in perfect physical shape.  You can chase them and then hold on to a leg until someone else shows up. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, no.  I just kind of gnaw at their ankles until they pull down.  All right, then.  But, you know, I keep up with it.  I have to.  Right now, I'm not on top.  Here's the thing.  Why would you make...  Why would you...  No offense, Debbie.  Or maybe offense.  I don't know.  But why would I allow someone with the bitterness towards society that a 4'11 person would have to administer justice fairly?  How can you do that knowing that you have never been dealt a fair shot so you are getting vengeance towards society from being 4'11"? 
[03:16:30]  Who the fuck is going to respect you and ever has respected anybody 4'11 from a physical standpoint or an authority standpoint, authoritative standpoint?  Why would I respect you?  So you're going to abuse the law.  No, I don't abuse the law.  What I do...  You know, if you're cool with me, I'll be cool with you.  And I get a lot of respect if I'm cool with them.  But as soon as they disrespect me, all bets are off. 
[03:17:00]  What if you're faced with, like, a 6'3", huge guy, and you've got to take him to...  You're the only one there.  What are you going to do?  I've dealt with it.  I've had to deal with it.  And what do you do?  I've had to fight him.  That person technically can beat the crap out of you.  I don't care what it...  Aren't you more tempted to, you know, fire off around?  Do you pull your gun out every day?  Because that's what I would do.  I'm tempted to shoot a lot of people sometimes, but I don't. 
[03:17:30]  That's why I carry a big stick.  Well, a small guy can have that, too, though.  A guy can have someone 6'5", beat the shit out of him.  I mean, you know, anybody...  He's a guy out on comp right now.  He's not a big guy, but he's really strong.  Well, he got beat up by a 12-year-old girl.  Hey, do you get respect from the other cops?  I do.  Yeah, I do.  I would think they wouldn't respect you.  How many rounds does a David and Goliath slingshot hold?  16?  Oh, about 13.  All right, Debbie. 
[03:18:00]  You're very brave to call the show today.  Bye, Debbie.  Bye.  Let's go to Madonna Mike.  Mike.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Mike.  Jimmy, good show Friday?  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, Patrice, did you just get called uppity before?  He did.  Hmm?  Patrice got called uppity.  No, he didn't get called uppity.  The guy said...  Keith said uppity, but not to Patrice.  Yeah, not to me.  Patrice knew not to speak up, though.  Shipless, maybe, not uppity.  Shipless.  Jesus Christ, do you know me?  Jesus.  Shipless.  Maybe there is a problem with the...  I got up at 7 in the morning to come here. 
[03:18:30]  I love the street.  All right, by the way, Debbie's lucky.  Hey, Debbie gets respect.  Yeah, sure she does.  All right, Mike, thanks.  Bye, boy, bye.  I'm sure she does.  Midget starts at 4'10".  I heard under 5, but it's 4'10".  So she got that off on a technicality.  Yeah, she just got it.  She's probably like 4'10".  Yeah, but if she's admitting...  Yeah, but if she's admitting...  8 or something.  See, like, my sister is short, man.  She says she's 5'0".  That means she's 4'11".  So Debbie's 4'7".  You think?  Yeah.  That she's admitting to 4...  What did she say?  4'11". 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, she's definitely shorter than that.  It's just how it works in the big city.  You're in violation.  You're in violation.  Well, that's cute.  All right.  By the way, I have a problem with Borders Books in Buffalo.  Borders Books in Buffalo?  I want to find out which...  Buffalo?  When was the last time you were in Buffalo?  No, no, no.  Here's the problem.  No, Borders Books.  I want to find out if it's true.  A guy, a fan in Buffalo emailed me, said he was in the Borders, and he asked if they sell  Jim Norton CDs.  And the guy went, who, that comic? 
[03:19:30]  He hates everyone.  Why would we sell his stuff?  Oh.  Now, I want to find out if that's true.  Um, I don't know how many Borders are in Buffalo.  And commend the man for keeping your trash out of his store?  Absolutely.  Yes.  Now, that would just be addressed in the harshest manner possible.  Of course.  If it's true.  All right.  We're going to get into the PSP discussion.  I want to slap someone in the head, take their personal fucking...  Well, considering that Borders probably sells Mein Kampf and other books of that ilk, I don't... 
[03:20:00]  I'm just...  I don't want...  Yeah, on the comedy section.  Oh, damn it.  Beat me to it.  Yeah.  I just don't...  There, I was there.  I just don't see mine as being that...  Hey, it's where those Jimi Norton CDs should be.  Mein Kampf.  Mike in Jersey, what's up?  Hey there, Mike.  Mike.  Ant's giving up too many freedoms.  Are you nuts?  What am I...  What freedoms did I give up?  Ah, you're not kidding.  He gave up...  He gave up the freedom of speech.  There you go.  Hey, Mike's an ACLU guy, and he thinks you're giving up too many personal freedoms. 
[03:20:30]  We're going to regroup.  We got Lindsay Lohan using the C word.  We got Fox 29 reporting on the PSP and how it's dangerous to the kids.  That's what I want to hear.  In just a bit.  The National Board of Health and Luckyfella brand suppositories bring you your body and  you.  Hosted by famed sexual behavior expert, Professor Jim Norton.  I'm a perv and I'm weird, but I'm straightforward.  Professor Norton outlines his very hands-on approach to sexual education.  Wait till your kids are sleeping and just lay over one of them.  They won't know.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  For example, the art of foreplay. 
[03:21:00]  The first thing I do is go to the bathroom and take one of those eight decibel shits.  Oral sex.  Why?  Sexual experimentation.  I was performing tushalinga.  And sexually transmitted diseases.  I wish I had AIDS so I could bite somebody.  And for the grown-ups, there's also a segment on marriage counseling.  Honey, you're 41.  Can I finally have the balloon nut?  He'll also stress the importance of lubrication.  You want it to sound like when your muddy boot gets stuck like a quagmire?  Another word to the wise from Professor Jim Norton.  Remember, I'm the faith. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, baby, boots and you gotta believe me.  I thought I saw it with my own show around you.  Norton's not here to enjoy some Black Sabbath.  I played it just for him.  He went to the bathroom to cry some more.  Aww.  All around me, I see many cases.  Is he weeping in the bathroom?  And you never gave me! 
[03:22:00]  Mooney, Texas, what's up?  I know what that sound is, that Japanese stuff.  Okay, what is it?  Okay, I think I saw the highlight someplace.  And it's where they got that game show where they leave those guys' buttholes up.  And they have to hold their turds in.  And then when they do finally spew, they measure to see how far it is.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God, Mooney!  Did I nail it?  No, I know the wrong answer.  Sorry.  Yeah, we're still trying to guess what this is. 
[03:22:30]  Patrice, listen to this.  Patrice, listen to this. 
[03:23:00]  I'm a champion.  I win the first time.  Oh!  Another wrong answer.  Still trying to figure out what that is.  That's great.  I would hope it was three seconds after the Enola Gay pulled that left-hand turn.  That's what I'm hoping it is.  All right, here's a quickie before we get into that PSP story.  Lindsay Lohan says Paris Hilton is a cut. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Where'd this come from?  E.T.?  Yeah.  And Lindsay Lohan.  Let's get the E.T. music.  We haven't heard Anthony's E.T. reporter voice in a while.  Where they overpronounce everything.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Well, there it is.  Tonight on E.T., we'll be looking at Brangelina and Tom Cruise and Tomcat and what they're up to. 
[03:24:00]  And Lindsay Lohan calling Paris Hilton a cunt.  A cunt.  A cunt.  Tonight on Entertainment Community Night.  How did they get those?  Paparazzi camera.  Paparazzi.  A lot of good stuff.  The paparazzi.  The video camera rolling.  Well, they collect a lot of stuff and then they, you know, farm it out to E.T. and all that.  Yeah, that's it.  But they can't play this on regular TV. 
[03:24:30]  So we got it for you here on satellite.  You look beautiful, Lindsay.  Are we parents, right, Lindsay?  Lindsay, we love you, Lindsay.  Yeah.  That's enough.  Parents a cunt.  I'm sorry.  Lindsay, why'd you get the wallet?  Lindsay, Paris is a what?  She's a cunt.  She's a cunt.  Why is Paris a cunt?  All right, Lindsay.  Why is Paris a cunt?  I understand that.  We got you saying a second ago.  Tell them dirty days to the same thing.  Paris is your friend.  Lindsay loves Paris.  I love Paris.  Listen up. 
[03:25:00]  Wow.  And they're like, why is she cunt?  Why is she cunt?  All right, well, we got you.  Let's say, we got you.  Make sure she say cunt, though.  Yeah.  Make sure she say cunt.  Listen.  Paris is a cunt.  What do you think she's saying?  A cunt?  That doesn't say cunt.  Yeah, it does.  She did not say cunt.  Paris is a cunt.  Uh-uh.  That's not cunt.  That is so cunt.  Is it a cunt?  Why am I supposed to bring white people?  I don't hear differently.  What is she saying?  Let's say the studio audience.  Cunt?  Not even I.  What could it possibly be if it isn't cunt? 
[03:25:30]  She probably, she probably, you know how you don't finish sentences or something?  It was fraudulent, but she didn't, there was no cunt.  You're a damn rich cunt.  No, Paris said, she said Paris is a cunt, and that's why her people are going, she's  kidding.  She went, I'm kidding.  And then you hear people going, she's kidding.  Her people are a publicist who knew it was bad, and they're going, that's why they panicked.  If she would have said anything else, the reaction never would have been that way.  Can you slow that up?  Paris is a cunt.  Paris is a what, Dan? 
[03:26:00]  That sounds like.  That's, that's, there's no one that fucking doesn't think that doesn't sound like cunt.  Fair.  Did I say cunt?  Sounds like cunt to me.  But listen to the reaction.  Listen to what the other people say.  And listen to Lindsay, what she says.  Okay, go ahead.  Listen.  And you can hear the gasp.  Yeah, someone is a DJ in a light bulb, but he's always good for stuff on the show.  He says, listen for the gasp right after she says it.  All right, all right.  You look beautiful, Lindsay.  Are you with Paris tonight, Lindsay?  Lindsay, we love you, Lindsay.  Yeah.  That's enough, man.  Paris is a cunt.  I'm sorry, Lindsay, why'd you say it's a walk? 
[03:26:30]  Lindsay Paris is a what?  She's a cunt.  She's a cunt.  White Paris is a cunt.  All right, Lindsay.  You didn't hear her.  Everyone heard it.  People hear the, and then you hear the publicist.  She's kidding.  She's kidding.  Yeah, that fucking pukey publicist.  But that was, everyone heard it.  Even people right there heard it.  That's their jobs.  He said, why'd you say it's a cunt?  We got you saying it a second ago.  Double 30 days in the second.  Paris is your friend.  Lindsay loves Paris.  I love Paris.  No.  Lindsay just said, I never said that.  They go, we got you.  We got you saying it. 
[03:27:00]  We got you.  Oh, they know they got it.  Vultures.  They got her.  They got her.  She said Paris to cunt.  She's just being playful.  I don't even know if she meant it.  She might have just been like, me and I'm going to say, where's Anthony?  If somebody said, yeah.  She meant it.  Oh, where's, I was thinking the same thing.  If someone came up to me and was like, hey, where's Jimmy Norton tonight?  Jimmy Norton's a fucking asshole.  You know?  And it would be like, you know, oh my God.  Oh, oh, oh.  Now, they're all competitive.  She meant it.  And she got caught.  Probably.  No, I didn't say that.  I meant he's probably fucking an asshole.  No.  He said.  No tranny?  No.  He said. 
[03:27:30]  She's probably somewhere filming us all sucking someone's dick.  That would have been like, oh, ooh.  This is what she said.  He said, I can smell your cunt.  What was that, Patrice?  That was cunt.  That was cunt?  Yeah, that one was, right?  Okay, listen.  No, cusp.  She's a cusp.  And multiple makes it.  What was that?  Oh, I never said.  Say that?  I threw a jizz in her hair, but.  Yeah, I tossed a load on her.  I went in her face as he should have.  That was great.  Let's move on to this. 
[03:28:00]  We got to protect the children from the PSPs out there.  Yeah.  The PSPs are causing all sorts of problems.  Very dangerous.  Are the words PlayStation Portable going to end up on your kid's Christmas list?  PSPs are good, clean, fun, right?  So why are they also known by the name PlayStation Pornable?  No, never.  Robin Taylor has some information that'll really open your eyes.  We don't want to spoil anybody's Christmas, but there are hidden dangers parents should  be aware of.  I'm sure you wouldn't give your child pornography, but you just might be giving them access to 
[03:28:30]  it with today's most popular electronics.  How about this, twat?  Don't give your kid a TV or a VCR or a DVD player or a computer because they can also  watch pornography on that.  They can get it on that too, but it's basically made for fucking gaming.  And don't give them uncles.  Anything you have that has some kind of wireless connection to the internet, you're going to be able  to download porn from.  This next clip, you've got to keep a visual in mind here. 
[03:29:00]  Seemingly harmless device can be dangerous.  And the end of the clip when the reporter says, Pandora's box still frames a porno, a swastika,  and the KKK.  No, no, the little girl's name is Pandora.  And there was something apparently damp and standing in the seat.  Portable gaming devices are all the rage, with a generation of teens convincing their parents  they're a must-have.  Yet these seemingly harmless devices can do more than play football or race cars. 
[03:29:30]  Inside is a high-powered computer that, with a Wi-Fi connection, can access the internet.  A parent can watch their child on the internet in the kitchen in the living room.  But with this, you can take it anywhere.  And that opens up Pandora's box.  It's not like a Rubik's Cube commercial.  Wait, so?  A fan of the serial music.  What the hell with awful music I was playing during that?  So what's the deal?  It's like a Wi-Fi or some shit?  It's a Wi-Fi? 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, you can get online, so you can play online.  Online games.  I understand all that.  And the second you're able to do that, you can also access websites.  So that's what people have been doing.  I don't know if you, can you play online?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll play online with that.  And they were saying that the children might use that to access pornography.  Well, I was having a problem networking mine into my computer network, which really pissed  me off.  Anytime I try to network computers, it's like, it takes fucking forever.  And then I get it and go, oh, that's what I had to do. 
[03:30:30]  And then when I have to do it the next time, I completely forget what I did.  I'm not a network guy.  You ought to call Mark Cuban, though.  That's what he does.  Ah.  Used to do.  All right, here we go.  A Minnesota boy got into trouble when he brought his PlayStation Portable to school.  Oh, no.  This is an incident that has opened our eyes.  On a dare, Jeff Harris showed his friends how his PSP could display pictures of naked  women.  A bunch of pictures went on, and then I turned it off, like, right away after.  That's no dare.  The dare should be he showed pictures of naked men. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, right?  I dare you to show big talk on this fucking thing.  His friends dared him to show horse dag.  I love the fucking music of this thing.  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.  It's like they're showing the little kid coming in close and back.  Yeah, what was it?  Like, in kaleidoscope vision and some awful 60s fucking porno music.  There's a girl in a long, like, green sweater skirt fucking hula-hooping behind him.  That's really, this whole report's like Austin Powers.  Wow, wow, wow, wow. 
[03:31:30]  That was horrible.  Chicks burning her bra behind the kid while he's fucking showing a picture of Harry Dean  Stanton.  And why is this a big deal?  It's just, you know, little boys finding another way to see naked chicks.  Absolutely.  It's been like this since the beginning of time.  Well, they shouldn't allow staples because those are going to Playboys to staples.  Right.  It's so stupid.  Pictures went on, and then I turned it off, like, right away after I did that.  It was simple.  All he did was tap onto the school's wireless internet connection. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, it's incredibly easy to find.  It's just shocking how much is out there.  that's great so they're looking on a dare they're looking at pornography oh boy how uh uh  used to bring in uh playboy like ripped out pages from playboy and you'd be in school in the uh in 
[03:32:30]  the playground and it was like drug deals going on you'd be like hey check this out oh yeah look at  this one i'll trade you this for that it's the same shit yeah same shit only great technology they just  use technology imagine having that as a kid in school what's wrong with the boy looking at naked  bosoms video nice all right wanting to cash in on the action the adult film industry is marketing  porn for portables earning the psp the nickname playstation pornable fortunately without credit 
[03:33:00]  cards most hardcore porn is out of kids reach because it is a money-making business and the  pornographers aren't interested in giving porn away if you don't have a credit card uh pornographer  doesn't want to doesn't want to deal with you  but that last guy his diction was so good i'm enraged wasn't it can you play that last the last  guy who said if you don't have a credit card pornographers card listen to steve's father 
[03:33:30]  uh pornographers wanting to cash in on the action the adult film industry is marketing porn for  portables earning the psp the nickname playstation pornable fortunately without credit cards most  hardcore porn is out of kids reach because it is a money-making business and the pornographers  aren't interested in giving porn away if you don't have a credit card uh pornographer doesn't  want to doesn't want to deal with you if you don't have a credit card credit card pornographer 
[03:34:00]  does not want to deal with you deal with you i earned that porno all you got to do is take the  filters off your google put in nude women you're done all the nakedness you want to see see pretty  girls beautiful girls beautiful girls when i was a kid i stole we magazine with pia zodora on the cover  just right oh you are is that the one where she was in the bathtub i don't remember no all right  patrice see you later where you going she says to go hey dog where you going oh he did he okay 
[03:34:30]  come and go as you please come back yeah go ahead you're going all right come and go as you please  but porn isn't the only danger out there hatred violence and the means to carry out deadly schemes  can all be accessed through gaming devices within internet connection and it doesn't make any  difference whether they're portable or played on a computer in your home there are scenes of extreme  violence out there that certainly could leave a lasting psychological scar but the greatest danger of 
[03:35:00]  all may be a child predator posing as another gamer pedophiles and people who want to hurt kids have  access to access to them and they do because this is a communication device always ask the kid how  big his rook is eight year old chess player are you i'm eight are you hung like a pawn or a king  nothing it's like the horsey i'm like a horsey it's like a horsey it's bent he's too young 
[03:35:30]  i don't even know it's called a knight it's the size of a horsey it jumps two two and then one it makes an l  well there you go my penis hooks the way a horsey moves  you know  now we have to deal with that all right yeah playstation pornable  like jim said you know take away everything then just take away everything there's a hidden danger 
[03:36:00]  for children in everything sure but we as adults and even i don't even mean like uh adult adults  people that could deal with things 16 years old 17 18 they could play these things and and access uh  porno and not be damaged by it but because of uh you know it could get in the hands of eight-year-olds  you gotta uh sanitize everything and some kids know how to use it responsibly but why don't you  just take away the fuck is the the uh the the crotchless barney panties that are popular with 
[03:36:30]  children exactly what my point was jimmy some children want to use them so they can bend over  and get a tee hee out of their friends and uncles yeah show you their little stinky pita  hey uh here's a guy mr torrance again torrance torrance i'm 32 and when i was a kid we used to slip  the porn magazine into a newspaper and then buy the paper then take it to the woods and hide it 
[03:37:00]  in the rocks and some plastic bags what a brilliant idea god it's become so easy for the kids to jack  off these what a brilliant idea the fucking porn in the news all i ever did when i was a kid is my  friend scott he had a fucking cat box full of cat shit so i would get drunk and then take the the  daily paper and put all the cat shit in it and put it back on the table so when his father opened the  paper cat shit fell on him what a great gag what a scumbag you are yeah he's now back at home after a

[03:49:00]  class and uh there was a whole class full of people it was dead silent and this guy walked by the outside  of the classroom door and i was i think a sophomore freshman high school freshman high school and there's  seniors in the class it was a math class and the guy walked by the outside door and he was singing  and the the song he was singing had the beat of it might have been a christmas song but the guy was  singing bop bop bop bop and i wanted to say shut the up which would have probably gotten a big laugh 
[03:49:30]  yeah but i bailed out and i went shut up silence the class was silent oh you bombed it didn't it was it  was horrible how unfunny it was it was crawl out of your skin embarrassing 
[03:50:00]  it was completely humiliating yeah he had a much better one his was really awful  i used to be the captain of the football team yeah  and i used to be the hype man you know like y'all how y'all feel and the team go fire it up  how y'all feel fire it up break down stick break down you know getting them all ready yeah so one day  we're playing this team for halloween right so i said y'all ready baby y'all ready to  fuck this team and they're like yeah then i said because they're gonna get a trick

[04:03:30]  motherfucker that you never purchased a hooker in your life  never swear on my family  aunt's a straight guy with that stuff  never did  aunt likes a naked girl  aunt likes his girl just to be naked and have regular sex  that's i like not regular sex like a  fucking missionary  put a hang a sheet between her  come on  yeah this gotta be something that you like  what's your freak thing  your thing  i'm not saying your thing with you and your girl because i know you won't share that  but what's your thing  you like a little pee on you  a little  nah  nothing weird like that  nothing that  i don't want anything up my ass  dirty nipples licked 
[04:04:00]  i don't want anything like that  you like your ass licked  no  no  you don't like your taint licked  under your balls  no  your balls licked  nothing like that  spit  there's that you know there's that uh  the geographic line of uh  longitude or latitude  that can't be crossed  but you're getting a whispering you like dirty stuff are you getting whispered to  like  no the talking doesn't really um  what's your thing  there's not a big uh  talking thing  what do you do  i don't like the way you're trying not to be a piece of shit  no no  you look at your goatees  i like fun uh  it says you got a problem  fun different like positions are cool where you can get a good look at things 
[04:04:30]  like i like looking at stuff  i like to look  i gotta be able to see nudity  i don't like girls covered up with shit  i don't like that  you don't like girls with a skirt with a skirt lifted  i like  well skirt lifted that's good as long as you're seeing some real estate  you know  i like the fucking diapers just pulled out a little bit  but that's gotta end  that shit's gotta like  come off  at some point  pretty early on  yeah that's that's pretty cool  i mean what's your thing  what's your fetish man 
[04:05:00]  like what really fucking gets you like  damn what really like  ah  really like  ah  you know  like what my thing now is  unsexy sexy shit  like  like i said i went to brazil  it's like i'm getting awful now  i watched this chinese um  porno  or this asian porno  i don't know chinese japanese  but the two girls  were unsexily  if that makes sense  squirting each other with titty milk  see that's not sexy at all  with not a sexy 
[04:05:30]  but i know what you mean  not like a  oh yeah  it was like  squirt  like they're joking with super soap  laughing having fun  and then the other one was squirt  the other one with milk  and like my girl washing a hooker in the shower  without sex appeal  just scrubbing her  and sniffing her  making sure she's clean  was  was  turning me on dude  like so  wow  just a chick  walking around  like if i can get  like four girls  and just walk around my house  naked  for no reason  eating food 
[04:06:00]  watching television  just being  and pee with the door open  and just being there nude  with no sex appeal  i think that's just right now  that's fucking  jerk off  i have that to a certain degree too  where i like a massage therapist  who's kind of square and regular  to go over the edge  because when you go so full circle  with perversion  that  that  that  you start to seek out the normal again  because that becomes so different  watching  just a girl  showering at the girl  that's like 13 year old  boys get turned on by that  and then you get older  and it doesn't do anything for you anymore  because you need dildos 
[04:06:30]  you need spit and piss  and a hard ass fuck  like yeah that's too innocent  and then you get so beyond all that filth  that it kind of comes circular again  and you're like wow  that is kind of sexy  like where i just like  regular fucking sometimes now  i don't need a lot of the dirty talk  i just need my nipples touched a little bit  i become more normal  by experiencing so much  fucking filth  that you start to go  ah maybe uh  this will turn me on  you get desensitized to filth  and go back to a regular  yeah it's awful  the regular becomes the filthy  what would you say the dirtiest thing  you ever did was  in your mind 
[04:07:00]  just the filthiest act you ever tried  I don't know  I have to go back a ways  sit on the chest  no never anything like that  never have a  never been anything like that  like a brownish tinged  unclipped cock  banging into your tonsils  brownish tinged  unclipped cock  unclipped third world cock  did you ever have a  did you ever have a  blatino  straddling your face  a blatino  I can honestly say no 
[04:07:30]  that has never happened  just not like  cause you two are fucking like  you two are way out there  I used to think  I used to think  Noah was hideous  in terms of  now the shit thing  I can't go to the shit thing  cause the human shit  it's just so  nothing sexy  about  any type of shit  human shit is the worst  thing  I've ever seen  I looked at a human  fucking piece of shit  that was  laid out  by the parking garage 
[04:08:00]  every day  for a year  and I wished  after a year  I had taken a picture of it  every day  to watch it decompose  slowly  but every day  I had to walk by  and go  some homeless guy  just  and you could tell  right where it was  it was in a corner  so you found  the perfect place  to lean  and take that  fucking big log  of human shit  it's the worst  and I can't  I don't know how  you had to be disgusted  with the idea of it  before you did it  oh who isn't  what did you do  what did you  what would any consumer do 
[04:08:30]  you take it in the mouth  and you jerk off  and then you rinse  for an hour  and question everything  I watched a shit video  one of those  shit videos  and I just  it just did nothing  for me  and those little  white girls  were shitting out  giant alligators  like  like  just  muffins  it's un-fucking-watchable  this is disgusting  but a little pee  and I told him about this  and he explained to me  why  what it did  because  I told him  I was in London 
[04:09:00]  when I used to go to England  all the time  and it was like  it's just an unceremonious place  you just walk around  late night  in this shitty English  everything's dusty  nothing's clean  and I'm just walking around  and I'm sad and lonely  and I was walking to the store  get some fucking cookies  I was ready  I was on  on killing myself mode  you know like  fucking cookies  and fruit punch  I'm gonna kill myself  so I'm walking  through  and I see this drunk  beautiful girl  tall  just  go behind a dumpster 
[04:09:30]  and squat  and she fired out  a laser beam  piss  like  like  Star Wars  like it wasn't sexy  you heard it sizzle  coming out  and I got  so  uncontrollably  horny  like I  I got that  kind of horny  like I  I was  I had to run home  because I was shaking  in my fucking  wow  how horny I was  like animal horny  and I was asking  Norton  because I knew  he was in the piss  at the time  but he was like  because it's naughty 
[04:10:00]  and it made sense  it's just because  she's not supposed  to do that  you're probably  gonna fuck her  a girl with the caliber  that's pissing out  the uh  but she was  behind a dumpster  she was like a model  it was that's what  it was like  she was gorgeous  and just took a dumpster piss  like behind a dumpster  wasn't a  wasn't a  oh someone's looking squat  it was a drunk  and just  I was like  oh  and I looked at the  the puddle  you waited  till she left  she stumbled away  to track her home  and I'm just looking  at this puddle 
[04:10:30]  behind a dumpster  and I'm like  wow  if I didn't see that  I'd be like  oh that's some nasty  motherfucker  but it was some  gorgeous girl  dab it behind your ears  it's also the privacy  of it  there's something  about seeing somebody  do something  so traditionally private  yeah  there's something  kind of sexy  about that  that's why people  like peeping in  on windows  and yeah  bathroom  whatever  you know  we see that woman  across the way  over at CBS  naked  and she's naked  doesn't matter  that she's you know  fat or whatever  she's just naked 
[04:11:00]  she's in her house  whether she knows  or not  that people are  watching her  she's running  through her daily  routine  and she takes  her clothes off  there's something  yeah  sexy about that  because it's  taboo  when was the last  time you jerked off  jerked off  do you jerk off  anymore  I think  without your girls  being around  without her permission  a little jerk file  how far does your  jerk file go back  let me think of my  jack file  that goes back a ways  what's the oldest  memory you could still  you still pull up in 
[04:11:30]  the jerk file bank  and beat off to  mine's is a  90  98  when I went to  Amsterdam  and it's not even  a fuck story  it's that  remember I told you  that the young  Amsterdam girl  and she told me  she was about  18 at the time  and I was 28  and shit  and she goes  I go  hey how come you  didn't give me  no pussy last night  and she goes  how old are you  she had that voice  and I go  what  what do you mean  how old am I  I'm 28  how old are you  she's like 18  and I go  well why didn't

[04:15:30]  right  just to make her  look like  I bought her  I bought her  a pair of Nikes  right  and this bitch  was walking  in the Nikes  like they were  high heels  she could not  walk  like a regular bitch  like a non-whore  she had to walk  on the ball  of her feet  because she wears  hooker shoes  all the time  she had to walk  on the ball  of her fucking feet  because she was  and I said  I can't  you're just a whore  I can't clean you up  it took her to walk 
[04:16:00]  in a pair of fucking sneakers  for you to realize  she's a whore  yeah like this chick  is just a whore  but then my girl  came with me  and you know  she found out  what she was  you know  we had that little thing  going  it was a money thing  but I was like  I can't even give you  I can't get no money  because my girl  was like  fuck you  first my girl  was horrified  to be out there  she was so scared  because I was like  looks baby  come on  did they hassle her  for money and shit  or no  my girl  nah man  how the fuck  do you go  from  hey I want to hook her  I'm going to 
[04:16:30]  bang this broad too  so  do you want the Maytag  which washing machine  how the fuck  it's because  they give you  you go to a strip club  okay  you go to a strip club  and you may  if you're feeling  like you're feeling crazy  right  you go to a strip club  you spend  $200  easy  in ones  and fives  or whatever  sticking shit down  girls  and they dance for you  not even naked  they get  semi naked

[04:17:30]  three times as much  and your money  spends  the same exact way  in here  so their dollar  spends like  a dollar  would spend here  some countries  you go  you know  it's like  I get $40  but everything costs  $20  so you go there  you eat like a king  you live like a god  you're with gorgeous girls  that probably  for the most part  if they were walking  down the streets here  they wouldn't even  spit on you  if you asked them to  they wouldn't disrespect you  if you said  could you just  disrespect me 
[04:18:00]  I have no time  to disrespect you  I have to go  there's gorgeous women  over there  and you can  you can have a good time  every day  for a grand total  of a hundred American  you can live like  a motherfucking Caligula  right  so  and the girls are beautiful  strip club girls  and they're fucking  touching you  they're hugging on you  they're not being  cunting and rushing you  they'll sit  have a drink with you  they can't carry you  and every flavor you want  from  every tent  every tent you want 
[04:18:30]  and they just treat you  in a way where  she was so cool  that  you know  a washer and dryer  she needed  my baby had to  wash her clothes  oh my god  yeah baby  I need you to have  good clothes  you don't think  she just thought  what a fucking sap  this guy is  no  because  because I didn't  make her feel  she might have  but it didn't matter  that's what I'm saying  women here  it doesn't matter  what they really think  you don't care  it's like  you know  make me  make me want to 
[04:19:00]  buy you a motherfucking  washing machine  bitch  how did you get all  fucked up over this  we were  well we were in  the whorehouses  were amazing  we were standing there  in robes  and I was taking  100 milligrams  of Viagra  and I was going  and fucking  three girls  like in a row  Norton's dick was raging  it was like  it was awful  you could hear  the top of his dick  going  boom  boom  me and Patrice  were standing there  one time  we're both in our robes  and dirty flip flops  and we're just  we're looking down  and my fucking rod 
[04:19:30]  is poking my robe out  it's ridiculous  it made me sick  how giant  it was like  it should have  Norton's dick  looked like it should have  those two shock things  and they go  okay clear  we were just looking  at my fucking boner  pushing my robe out  and we were just laughing  like five year olds  and then he brought  a girl over  and he opens his robe  and she just  sucks his nipple  it was like watching  a fucking  an animal feed  its young  it was just  disgusting 
[04:20:00]  a ten just  suckled his nipple  it was such  Sodom and Gomorrah  and I pulled it out  as if she was  supposed to do that  yeah  I'm just sitting around  in this too small robe  and these hot girls  and I'm sitting there  and see  what it is  is like  they're so good  at wrapping you up  into this  into this fantasy land  where you  there was a time  where I had to  I would go  into this night club  and I would hide  from girls  like as if I'm  sexy like that 
[04:20:30]  and I had to figure  out a way  to like  wait a minute  I'm not gonna be  hiding from  sexy women  because they  they give you  the illusion  of jealousy  they give you  that illusion  like his girl  would give the illusion  that you're not  to talk to any  other women  she's like  this is a real  thing we have  like how dare you  but it's  it's like  but what it is  is I used to  get out of that  by going  look at  is the pussy free  the word  grotches  I knew how to  talk to hookers  so it'd be grotches  it's like  basically I would  learn how to say 
[04:21:00]  if the pussy  is free  then you can  say some shit  like that  but I gotta  give you a dime  bitch  and I'm paying  for everything  so it got to  a point  where I would  just  I would have  three or four  girls that I  would just  I'd pay  and keep around  and they would  all hate each other  and I would  just feel  amazingly like  a pimp  but I was  they all got  50 to be there  and they all  just sit there  saying  that 150  could be mine  and you're  giving 50  apiece  and I go  you can all  go if you  like  cause I can  replace you  easy  sounds like 
[04:21:30]  a great place  it's fun  why won't you  ever go  why would I  go  I have no  reason to  go  no the  crime  is  the reason  I won't  go back  is a little  too scary  it's getting  tough  it is right  is it getting  worse every time  it just sounds  scary  it was getting  you can feel  it  you know  and the thing  is  the money  was going  down  that's what  made me  stop  why  it became  almost  two  instead of  when I first  went it was  three to one  and then by 
[04:22:00]  that time  it was two to  one  and things  got more  expensive  it was three  to one  and the girls  were asking  for a hundred  then when it  became two to  one they were  asking for  150  I'm going  bitch I'm  not making  out here  you're making  it tough  to come  so I bought  some artwork  hanging on my  walls and I  think that's the  last time I'm  going to go  how many times  have you been  six  and the last  time I might  have went again  but the thing  is too I like  to go for the  miles  I don't do a lot  of traveling  all over so I 
[04:22:30]  want to get that  gold status  and that  ten thousand miles  if I go to  three times to  Brazil a year  that's my status  you know  yeah you could go  anywhere but  my girl loved  it though man  she loved it  how long did  you go for  11 days which  is way too  long but  she loved it  man she was  scared in the  first two days  and then  god bless her  she is a  fucking  soldier dude  she is a  trooper  attention  and she just  she is ready 
[04:23:00]  to fucking  go  and being there  with her  like a lot of  times I think  that she do this  because she loves  me and that's  she's gonna do  she is an  predator  I am  I love it  she is a  fuck  I really fell  in love  when I went  to Brazil  you two could  be like one  of those serial  killer couples  those couples  that like kill  people and then  there's pictures  of them right  after you kill  people just  laughing and  drinking at the  bar and having  fun and shit  when she first  got there she's  like oh my god  I feel so bad  for them  and she was 
[04:23:30]  all like give  her extra  and she was  all gentle  by the end  of the day  right  like the whole  routine I would  just get in a  shower with a  chick and she  would go  the girl's  like no  no and she  like this  bitch won't  let you get  in a shower  get this  bitch out  of here  and she's  like she  gotta go  tell her to  leave in  the bullshit  like she  would  because I  spoke a  little  Portuguese  she said  tell this  bitch to  get old  Scramo  right  she was  a gangster  by the end  Scramo  so I said  sweetie  she was running  shit by the  end of it  because I  looked at the 
[04:24:00]  girl like  and I gave  her 50  she said  what the fuck  you gave  you gotta save  that for  another bitch  get this  bitch out  of here  by the end  of the time  my girl  was a  full fledged  dude  like she  didn't fuck  around dude  did she go  to the  thermos  she went  to one  not um  not  there's one  called um  there's  quacho  that's where  they come  out and  we had a  great time  I went  into the  room with  two girls  and my
